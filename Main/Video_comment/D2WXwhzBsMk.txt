Poor baby 😢 I'm glad she got better
I’m come watch this video about every 3-4 months
That is a happy lil dog
I read the book about Sally the dog. I’m not going to see the video of it.
Any update on this little angel?
All the videos on this channel make me cry. They’re so sweet. I feel so bad for the puppy.😢
OMG she is a beauty... Lucky owners👍👍
I'm curious what kind of breed she is.... Maybe a dachshund mix? 🥰
I have a book that is this story
Fav part 14:09
I read the book
The Lord is truly grateful  for all the animal saviors that have accepted the challenge. God bless you all. I love you all too.
girly my little girl read the book she keeps reading this book.
This is so precious 😇😇😇😇
Sally isn't just a dog...She's a bloody miracle on earth❤
She's the cutest
Oh, man, the pinnacle of human kindness!
Every time I see this story it always makes me cry, but I like it a lot
good humans doing great stuff for amazing dogs. There is hope! Yay for Sally!
❤
Omg so cuteeeeee
You guys are amazing ❤
God is watching over that girl.
❤❤
I cannot stop smiling.
Cute.
I’ve come back to this every so often wondering where this baby is today and how she is doing? ❤😢❤
Sounds the breeder should be in jail
So much love! ❤
Should name her bubbles
She's like a lil fish
Perils of inbreeding seeking to achieve purebreds.
It’s wonderful you put so much effort and energy into taking care of that puppy. Things like that will come back to you.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😖😖😖😖
I read this whole book I love sally god bless you I cried
marry me!
God healed her❤
OMG she is the most precious little baby. I feel for. What a strong pup💜💜💜
❤
Heartwarming
What a wonderful story 🥲🥰🐾
Tell me I’m wrong….thats the chainsaw dog
The love that we don't deserve from God: He gave everything to us and still we sin over and over, but he still love us that's why he saves us not because we deserve it but because his love for us is beyond understanding. If it wasn't for Jesus we all would be in h e l l  God loves you, he always did, he  just doesn't love your sins, you may feel like God isn't there for you when he always have been. His love for ALL of us is eternal
SHES SO CUTE!
Her face is too cute! I'm glad sally pulled through
She is the same kind of dog like my dog pig cause I got 4 and pigs just one of them
That's one of the best stories I've seen.
what an incredible story.
Little warrior she pup🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉praze Christ Jesus our God 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉fore her and you🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What the cute little girl pup i very ever seen 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉evangelical warrior friend Clay 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉Australia sends its love to you 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
How is she doing
WONDERFUL
Omg as the wife of a lung cancer patient this made my heart skip a bit. It's so good that folks do rescue animals that would probable be put down. Thank you for saving Sally and all those like her.
Sally is so tiny and so adorable♥️♥️
My heart🥹
Praying for a speedy recovery and a long healthy life lots of love
Poor little baby I seriously cried when I saw the beautiful little angel what she had to go through 😢it broke my heart ❤
did yall know they have a custom like animation? instead of a thumb popping up its a paw and its adorable
Such a beautiful story, congrats on new beginnings! 🎉
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💕💕💕💕 little friend. I love you.
Why does she remind me of skye from paw patrol?
nice video my friend
This has touched my heart ♥ she is so cute smart and such a strong girl I love her you took such good care of her this will forever be my favorite video of all time ❤❤❤
Omg! I read the book of this!!
Most vets would tell you to put them down because they don't want to deal with special needs, or when they do, they want to charge you a mortgage price instead of actually caring. God bless these people for saving her🙌🏻🙏🏻🤗
oh I love puppies.
so much cuteness
I have the book I'm  happy she's better now!
now that is a strong woman.
Bulldogs are not meant to be skinny. I learned that years ago. Their bodies look sick; they're meant to be fat, and they look so cute like that with their short arms and body.
What a brave, cute and clever girl. ❤
Нет ну что за сладкая булочка, пушистая жопка❤❤❤🥰🐶 как здорово, что ей достались вы🎉
I love her! ❤ she has my heart!
What an absolutely adorable puppy soo soo sweet
Ngl the dodo would be a better vegan than that one vegan teacher
Thanks for not giving up on Sally. ❤
I'm happy to know there are great people in life
So great to see 🎉🎉🎉🎉
It's wonderful that y'all were able to help her get better! God Bless ya 🙏🏿 ☺️
Oxygenate the scrup!🥲
Extreme levels of cuteness.
We have two Doxie's currently and one that has passed. I recognize a Doxie baby anywhere. Thank God for these Angels on earth. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow most people would've put her to sleep and said it was hopeless for her to have quality of life. You are such a one of a kind rare amazing, pure hearted person for refusing to give up on her and for putting in so much work, time, money and energy to save her and give her such a miraculous life! 👏 🙏  thanks for being the best example of a human!
I watch your book sallys story i love it
Daum, her story made grown man tear up..
😢😢😢❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍😍😢😢😢🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤔🥐
God bless you
OMG SHES ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 🤩🤩🤩🤩 I LOVE HER 😍😍😍
It breaks my heart to see any animal in this situation let alone a puppy 😢
Thank you for caring, and loving her
As the son of a now-retired veterinarian, I love nothing more than seeing videos like these showing the progress, and ultimate recovery of our fur-babies, like this little ball of JOY!!!
Now THIS is the correct thing to watch after just waking up at 10 AM
Maybe the cutest puppy ever!
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
So sad. Put her down 😢
Oh my she's adorable. Every living thing deserves help. We all share this planet.
Bubble was better name then sally
The girl is so beautiful
She's gorgeous!!!
She’s like deadpool 😢
Where is your god? Why does he let someone so pure suffer like this? Why does he let someone who is bad live? Because god doesn't exist... if he did, a little animal wouldn't be in this situation... I'd rather watch a decapitation video than see a hurt dog.
Yea buddy!!!
This was an amazing story. My heart 💖 was full of joy. Thanks to everyone for a job well done. GOD bless you all
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Thank you soo much🙏🙏
@DoctorMike found a vid where a dog gets air treatment 😊
🥲🥲🥲
This story is STILL a "tear jerker"!🥲🥺🤗  🐕🐾🐶 I feel all the Love extending to anyone who is blessed to see her awesome recovery!  I hope 🙏 you'll have each other for many years to come 😊😇⚓🖤
She's demands freedom
She’s so cute I’m going to cry
( ‘-‘ )
What a cuddly pup
I just read the book! its amazin!
And Kristi Noem shot her dog because she didn't feel like training him.
The work you do is a thing in the world you find less and less. Keep on doing this wonderful and heart warming care taking.  You are wonderful people! Seeing this almost made me cry.  All the best and love to you guys!
As a 56-year-old man with respiratory issues, just imagining what that poor little girl is going through brought tears to my eyes. I pray she enjoys a long, healthy, and comfortable life.
This is so awesome. What a lil fighter she is!
😭😄
What was her diagnosis? Thank you, Dodo for sharing this heartwarming story!!
2:49 she looks like those toy walking puppy toys
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Omg she’s adorable

We love you Sally girl!!
You and your family are Perfect ❤❤❤Wonderful Family as well ❤
yown!!! ang pagbabalik ng OG ppop ng pilipinas bago ang sb 19 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I have the book and it’s really good. You guys should get it. I’ve been reading it since like a month y’all should get it.
Every detail is perfect from the eyes to the tail
i love when humans shows kindness and gentleness towards animals. Her patience in loving and taking care of this baby. God bless your heart lady!
I was ready to cry myself to death.
Those at-home oxygen chambers are a game-changer! We found them online after our cat was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and would end up struggling to get oxygen. We showed our vet that the at-home chambers exist, and she was really enthusiastic about us getting one. It has helped our little cuddly baby multiple times! Especially because a card ride to the emergency vet just for oxygen treatment would be traumatic for him :(  It's really scary and heartbreaking watching a baby struggle to breathe, so I empathize with these people.  Our cat is doing better now, much better than was predicted. Thank you to the vets and the scientists and thanks to GOD
An amazing effort and good job!  While humans aren't as lovable as people, I wish that children could be afforded the same care.  But practicing caring for purer souls like this will help us.
❤😊❤
This makes me so happy! God bless each and every one of you for all you have done for this little girl and, I'm sure, many others.
What breed is the dog ?
Everything made sense here.
I have this book!!
I love the part where Sally was playing with the toilet paper.🐕😂
WOW she's an adorable lil fighter!❤
Thoughts and prayers  precious
Just came from the book and she is so cute  and her little woddles are cute too ❤
I truly am mixed about the effort and cost to save this sweet girl. It's wonderful that there are people willing to put in the time to save these animals, but I then think of all the healthy animals in shelters that could use this money and attention. Instead of letting Nature take her course, we euthanize healthy animals.
IM SO HAPPY 4 THIS PRECIOUS ANGEL HER SITUATION W HER BREATHING TOUCHED MY HEART AND SOUL.I STRUGGLE W ASTHMA.
you are beautiful people!! many thanks for your hardwork wich have save her life and improve step by step!!! be blessed
❤❤❤❤
Euthanize stupid mutt
You will never know if there is brain damage until the dog is an adult.
Adopt don't shop ❤
I don't call those people breeders.  Those people only breed for money!
As a father of Premie twins this video made me ball my eyes out! They want to live!!!!
This is a beautiful story. Wonderful love demonstrated by all.  Baby girl, live long and enjoy life.  You are precious!!!
I HAVE THE BOOK AND I LOVE IT!
❤
Wholesome.
I'm so happy for you precious Sally❤
The editing is top notch I enjoyed every second of it.
You all are absolute angels for saving her and giving her her best life!✨💖✨
Does anyone know what breed she is?
This lil one created by God had his fortitude & is definitely embracing it as she demonstrates her fighting spunk & love for life & her surroundings. Thank God for such kind helping souls 💝🙏
6:41 If Sally wants to pull all the toilet paper out, you just let her do it, obviously
Looking at her build, I'd say there is more to this than just a complication from aspiration during nursing. She looks like there are some genetic issues anyway, and when something like that is visible, you can rest assured there are invisible things going on in that body as well. Glad to see she was given a chance at life.
What incredible women, all the time, effort, love, dedication, kindness they showed her made it possible for her to become a regular doggy. It took awhile for this but look what a wonderful pet they have. Thank you and bless these women for their dedication to this gorgeous little girl. May she live a long, happy, healthy life full of love and everything good for her. Plenty of hugs for her.❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🎉🎉😉😉💯👏👏👍👍💞💞😚😚😘😘😍😍🤩🤩😇😇😇🙏🙏🙏💖💖💖😘😘🥰🥰😍😍🤩🤩🥳
What an absolute sweetheart. So glad she got to experience life outside the bubble. She's a fighter❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is probably the best and moving the dodo video I've ever watched.
That's just beautiful no qualifiers.
Aweee lil baby.
I'm here watching this 2yo vid and tearing up 😢, but happy tears, that there is still beauty and kindness in the world, which we all need to remember.  THANK YOU to Kathryn and Bonnie and those that support you through all that you do ❤❤❤❤
Blessed Be🙏🌻🫶💛🥰
Thank you for taking such good care of this precious life and god bless you young lady
❤❤❤❤❤❤
She has the sweetest little face ❤️
You got❤her God bless you ❤️
How you knot
She’s precious!!!
❣️ Everyone deserves a chance.
i kinda find it interesting that she was kinda cross eyed, probably adapting to the oxygen cannule bteween her eyes?
She’s so cute, she deserves the world
I have the same bed😊
This is such a wonderful story. Sally is adorable. Thank you for taking care of her and allowing her to do her thing on her own.
Bubble dog. Now 5.99!!*          *Plus shipping and handling.
God bless he hell the little puppy❤❤❤😊
You care takers are God’s Angels. Thank goodness for all of you and your loving care.❤
I looooove everybody who take care of her and fight for her <3
Thank you
Yes i knew how bubble puppy felt i once has aszarbated asthma stay over night at the hospital then I knew I had to learn how to clean my lungs 🫁  out so I started drinking a hot water lemon drink 🍸 later on was followed by an organic herbal flush this was a five long years long story short my lungs are asthma free this passing summer was my second  year asthma free
It's always the one with the pain, understand the pain and try to live the best life he has.   Like they say, it is a dying star that shines the brightest
imagine how much 💵 they had to spend on oxygen.
what a sweetheart..
I watch this video like once a month. Shes too cute.
❤
This just makes me feel so many things. She is SO CUTE AND SWEET!!! Just a.. just a precious lil baby🥺🥺🥺🥺 (I was squealing the entire video LIKE, ACK THE WAY SHE WALKS IS SO SILLY!!!! She looks so SOFT AND CUTE!!! AND I LOVE DACHSHUNDS!!)
Looks like her pulmonary and cardiovascular reserves improved drastically ♥️
Has to be the cutest dog I ever seen
Aww, she's so cute🥹🥹
This one will make more defective puppies. Survival of the fittest.
🥹❤️❤️❤️😭😭 Thank you for saving this baby
i love that puppies can leave Plato's cave and we can see the wonder when they discover a new world
This ppl are the peak of the most wonderous, generous and amazing  of what a person can be... i... i try to be lile that... and... i keep trying.
This baby pup is adorable and I love how she never gave up on trying to be out her bubble ❤
_NOT_ loving on her in her little bubble must have been the hardest thing in the world!!
best story ever🥲 seeing Sally greet her at work in the end feels a bit bitter sweet but fully satisfying story nonetheless
I need an update on her
The story of 'puppy in a bubble'
god bless her soul
LOVE ❤️
NEVER BACK DOWN! NEVER WHAT?!? You live, Sally! You’re bloody loved, you cute little baby!!! We love you, ya beautiful dingus darling!!!
Words can't express how much I love this little angel, she might genuinely be the cutest dog I've ever seen
The puppy is so cute :›
As a person who has gone through with asthma like this I understand stand how scary it can be and even for your loved ones  Fortunately my asthma is a lot better Lord Jesus is good
Help. I can’t stop kissing my screen 🥺
She’s a weiner 😭😭
she is so good she knows when to go inside to get some air
I also have the book 📖 ❤❤
I'm glad we're saving these wonderful blessings ❤❤❤
My wife is a vet tech too. We have 2 dogs that were left at her clinic.
She's worth every minute of it.  How can she be so cute?  🎉
Sweetest little girl ever!!!  Much love
she is so cute
Cutest little thing ever!!!
I was in the hospital with double pneumonia and had to be on a high percentage oxygen for 18 days before they started weaning my oxygen without telling me. I just see the puppy gasping and know how that feels. Ive never ever shat my pants before in my life, but that gasping and everything going dark, that sure did it. The nurses were so sweet about it, i was trying to sob but just kept coughing, making it worse. Nurses are angels ❤ I wish sally a long and respiratory issue free life ❤❤
no animal story has ever gotten me emotional enough to actually tear up and I volunteer at a dog shelter. so happy these wonderful people didn't give up on her
My uncle has edema in his lungs and feet and ever since he had open heart surgery 7 months ago he has been depending on ox°2 for every and about thing ever since,i cant imagine what she went through but god bless her and her savior, amen.
this is one of the best clips ever omg, i smiled so much during the whole video
This is probably the wrong question, but what does it feel like for a healthy human to be inside the oxygen chamber with her? I know they do that at casinos & after surgeries and such- Does it make you feel more alert? Or is it a negligible difference.
Poor thing 🥹 I wonder she that innocent when she was pup
When you see this you wonder how crazy evil people could abuse and be mean to such wonderful good ok innocent creatures.
Please do an update! I hope this baby is still doing well!!
Just slowing depriving her of oxygen lol Edit: I'm just kidding, it's adorable and well deserving
Awe. Her little lungs needed some more time. I’m glad for the patience and support that she has received.
SHE LOOKS LIKE DOG FROM THE GRINCH!!!!
Amazing to see the little doggy doing so well!  And the gal in the orange T-shirt seems nice?
nice!💫💰
she took "window licker" literally
We ❤️ you sally
I love how the kids are so gentle with her.
😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕
2025 anyone?
I❤her❤❤❤❤❤
😮
Them cheeks gonna getting split wide open
I tried super hard to keep a newborn abandoned bunny alive but it got respiratory distress and sadly died this morning 😢😢😢
Two years, is she still alive? God I hope so. Between Ozzy and the Hulkster this week, dk if I can handle much more heartache.
sweet girl
She’s the cuuuuutest 😍😍🥰🥰🥰 Thank you to everyone who didn’t give up on her. 🥹
Totally love taking our dogs on camping trips. We bought a used tandem kayak and got them life vest and got them out on the water. They love the hikes and are learning to like the water. Little Toby is adopted from a pound and is getting a little old. Those mountain lake water makes him shiver, so he can't stay in too long. They are part of the family at home, so they should be part of the family vacation as well. They love tent camping. They are like our children when they are young. They love their tent.
That's so sweet 🎂
God bless you guy's 🙏😇❤❤
broooo i cant w all this cuteness
love, love the Dodo' videos
This one made me sobbb haha
This is what happens when breeders attempt to create a "designer dog" without any regard for the health & welfare of the animals. She's a little fighter and they didn't give up on her. Thank goodness.
Omg shes the cutest fricken thing ever🥹😭❤❤
I remember seeing this video when it first came out and was crying because of this tiny little soul suffering.  Seeing her in the end I had tears of pure joy watching her running and jumping. She is definitely a trooper! No stopping life in this little girl! She was determined to live.
what a beautiful story thank God there are amazing people like this in the world!
Dedication ❤
We could learned a lot from this little puppy 😊
Aww shes so cute im so happy she got better! 😁❤️
Such patience and devotion.
I remember reading this book
Heaven is so smart, it can't help but give us it's innocent creations
😍
Look at that puppy's smile 😁 9:41 so sweet!
What an inspiring video!!! Sally is the CUTEST BABY EVER!!!😢😭❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How did she eat, drink and go to the bathroom? That's never mentioned.
“To you, your dog is just a chapter of your life, but to them, your their whole book”
How can I send you a picture 😅
Thank you ❤
This is why I Love,love,love...The Dodo!God Bless Sally,& all those who love her,& helped her to survive!!!🙏🇱🇷🐕🫶✌️❤️
My question is how do u feed her😢
This took a mind-blowing amount of effort and dedication.  Thank you!  The world is richer because of your effort.  What a sweet, beautiful doggie.  ❤
A HUGE thank you to all the people who take care of animals.❤❤❤
Thankyou for helping her it's a horrible thing when you get breathe poor little girl ❤❤❤❤❤
That took really commitment,  getting Sally through her early months, thank you all ❤. She has an amazing zest for life, I hope she enjoys many future years with you all 😊
I've had pretty severe asthma since I was a baby and this video was so heartwarming and touching. That precious little baby was lucky to have those awesome dedicated people to care for her and help her persevere. As always nothing cheers me up and makes me smile like an episode of The Dodo. Thank you!!!
She's to cute I'm going to died!!
That was sweet❤
I read the story from my book fair
Thank God you saved her, she it’s so…adorable!
She’s so adorable ;-;
🥰💐🥂
Reading the book abt Sally with my daughter. So cute to read it then watch this video.
man that thing is NOT holding oxygen
I have this as a book! (Yes there is a book)
All of you are just AMAZING!!!  Thank you for saving the animals! God Bless you and your family, and of course our four-legged friends!💋💋💋
That's so amazing the larger kennel you built for her while her lungs adjusted to the outside world.
poor child
Ok CUTENESS OVERLOAD!!
I have the book!
This reminds me of my ptsd healing journey. One day I realized I went through the whole day without a ptsd flashback and panic attack. But I didn’t get hopeful. The next day was the same. And before I knew it my flashbacks had all but disappeared. I still get them once every 1-2 years. But they’re way more manageable. And it took almost a decade for me.
That look like my dog
I have a book Sally story❤ sally is so cute
I love this story. That pup is a cutie.
bubble puppy: wait so there's a outside of the outside!?
I love this puppy ❤
It is mesmerizing what love and strength can do to a creature❤ Sally may you live a long, fun and amazing life.
Why do dogs need to go through this😭
what a beautiful job thank you oh so much for the love and precious care - wonderful humans for wonderful animals - this is how it should be!
I read the book I love sally ❤❤❤❤
I hate breeders, selfish and greedy, animals are not objects to be sold and disposed of.  Thank God for this kind vet tech, vets and lady who adopted her. They gave everything to help this girl❤ May she live a long and healthy life in her forever home ♥️
U have the patience of a saint
U are such a kind human
you ladies are angels for saving that precious little girl and you Bonnie for giving her a forever home she truly knows what love is ❤❤❤❤😂❤❤

Could the ratios be adjusted in the tent so she could gradually acclimate to our atmosphere?
What an incredible recovery! It's amazing what effort, care and love can do. All life matters. Thank you for saving this precious puppy. Many blessings to these wonderful women. ❤

I remember I read a book about sally
Oh, she's adorable ❤ God bless her 💕🇬🇧
woow..sangat menabjubkan..❤❤❤
0:44 the little face 😢
Okay, I tried to draw a line where I cry and don't cry. Little Sally stepped over it.  Edit: WAIT IS IT JUST ME OR DOES SHE HAVE HETEROCHROMIA?!
These videos lower my blood pressure 😭🥹
💗
Its so cute ❤❤❤❤
My friends and i recently bought 3 copies of the sallys story book! So far we all love it ❤
How amazing to watch her grow and be happy 🎉
What a wonderful transformation!!! Thank You to the kind people, WHO Put so much work, care and effort into saving the tiny pup!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is so heartwarming. I wish all the best for lil" Sally
Chatgpt introduced me to this channel 😭💗
I am so glad that Sally is out of her bubble!! It's so inspiring to see her having fun and enjoying herself.😀What a little sweetheart she is. She gets to be with other dogs too! 🐶💕🐾🐾🐕
This is absolutely so precious. The amount of time it took for her lungs to strengthen, and the state she was in makes me think she was born with underdeveloped lungs rather than aspirations related illness.  While this girl absolutely deserves to experience everything life has to offer, a word of caution environment conditions lie pollution, and allergens are something I'd be very conscious about when taking her out. If her lungs where damaged severely or under developed they may never function at 100% and these things could cause them irritation and thus to become inflamed.   Thank u for not giving up on her.
Shes too cute.
May God bless you all for saving her and raising her safely ❤❤❤ she is a miracle ❤
She is the cutest puppy ever! And so smart! ❤❤❤❤
My first reaction is that she is such a brave & courageous beautiful puppy and was given the best possible chance of survival by a very patient & caring person who was truly a compassionate lifeline!!😅😅😅😅
Shes literally the most precious little baby omg 😩
Swimming lessons for puppies 😍😍😍😍

Guess what I saw the book! And it’s called Sally’s story it’s such a good book! Good job dodo!
I love the dodo channel
I love the book 2:33am
That’s the kinda cute that I can’t handle!
Why am I crying 😅
What an amazing story!  Such loving and patient Caregivers, I'm so impressed with all the work and the great results!
Thank you
Omg sooo cute
not to be confused with the bubble puppy from bubble guppies
Beautiful story. Thanks for saving her. She is so sweet.❤❤❤❤
I'm so happy she was able to heal with love and patience as well as strengthen her tiny lungs 😊❤
As a trainer myself, other dogs being there for her new home are the #1 thing I would use, personally, once she was strong enough to meet them. Happy she's got a pack.  Dogs need packs like we need families. Without them, especially while young, we are lost.

Hello from Arizona! I am a 3rd grade teacher and one of my students donated the book “Sally’s Story” from the book fair earlier this year. We read a couple chapters in the mornings to start off the day. When we finished the story, my students were so eager to watch this video, as mentioned in the book. My class asks me every day about updates on Sally. We loved Sally’s story and are so proud of this little pup! If you see this, we would love to be pen pals with Sally & get an update on how she is doing! ♥️
What a gorgeous long hair doxy.  Worth every bit of that extra care.
Ty for her amazing  rescue ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊
Go, Bubble Puppy! The world is yours to explore now! Wishing you the happiest life ever!
I’ve already read the book about Sally and it’s so exciting to see the actual video they mentioned in the book! ❤️
Im having a rough time right now and this gave me hope. thank you
It’s true… people who work with and adopt animals are angels, pure good hearted people. Innocents among us, sinless! All the vets and vet techs I’ve met in real life are truly good people who love ALL animals… humans, dogs, cats, ALL! I would never imagine these people ever doing anything bad against another - especially on purpose. They just don’t have it in them. This is all to say… people like this exist. Thoroughly good, decent people. It’s so rare and unexpected these days that they are now considered ANGELS on earth!
That was the sweetest story.  You are wonderful women (mothers) to care for this puppy……absolutely heartwarming!  Thank you and God bless!
I love this story so much ❤❤❤, such  wonderful people helping this cutie 💓 💗 💖
the dog is so cute🐶
She Is Such An Angel 😇 Thank You For sharing
She's a strong minded lovely little puppy, so playful & really quite physically strong considering her start in life. First-class!!😅😅😅😅
Sally is sooo pretttyyyy
My hearttt
😮 this is so cute this is so cute this is a little dog that is so cute 🥰
What an incredible transition! Wow! ❤
Lovely story, superb video, adorable pup.
oh this was so cute!!! You guys are amazing
Incredible testimony for this pup, so happy for her ❤president God  shes a tough one!
OMG I HAVE A BOOK ABOUT SALLY'S STORY'S😨
Confession. Just watched it again! Still completely blown away by the veterinarian team! JUST WOW!
During the past two years I have watched this video a dozen times! Great job Sally, such a fighter! GREAT JOB VET TEAM!! Wow! No words!
Aw bless her wee soul xxxxxx
My god that dog is ADORABLE 🥰
I read this book in the course of like 3-4 days. I got this yesterday at the book fair after school and then I started reading that like immediately and then I came very interested in it and I cannot stop reading. It has only been a day and I'm already on. I think I'm on chapter 11. I am. I just checked. I'm on chapter 11. I think I'm probably going to finish reading this tomorrow. Did anyone else read the book?
My sister's dogs got pneumonia and it cost $4000 for about a day and a half of treatment. Something needs to be done with the prices of care. Thats highway robbery. This dog would have cost tens of thousands if they billed an owner.
thank you for fighting
So sweet.
Mama bonnie is sooo beautiful ❤️ love her hair, almost distracted me from the sally for a min there 😂❤
She’s beautiful
Amazing experience... this baby wants to live & is so loved xoxoxo blessings
God bless. Long life, great health, happiness for all. Ameen
Well freakin done! This is what it’s all about.
Life is just too pressous for a little puppy like her. 🐶❤So cute!❤🐶 We had a golden retriever named Cassie, and she was adorable, too!
My son bought this story in a book at his school book Fair last month. We finished reading it so we just watched this video.  We feel like we know Sally! Great story and Kat did amazing nursing her back to health.
What an adorable for baby. Is and what beautiful people who rescued her.
I love that someone truly gave completely of themself for that pup and then just gave it to someone else (who was chosen). That is so unselfish! A lot of rescuers I've been exposed to are so "Me, me ME!" It's all about THEM..... oh, and the dogs. Not you! What an example you've set for all. Me included. God bless you. ❤❤
❤ she is such a sweet angel I think I would have been very very protective of her thank you to your technician and yourself for taking such good care of her and giving her a forever home 🏡💕
These goung men are heroes!   The dog owners are losers!   They don't deserve dogs!!!!!!!
What is that thing on her nose?
Definitely should’ve named her bubbles
Sally will go on a dog race 6:25 that’s literally how the book said she did it 8:23
At my school We are reading Sally’s story.
so it's not so much like the movie The Boy In The Bubbles, as it is an oxygen tent.  Sure worked for her!
Go, sweety! ❤
She is soooooo beautiful ❤ I've got a Weener too called LaTina ❤ Sally is the double of her ❤❤
Such a sweet puppy ❤
I may have made a Sally story with eye color with her dog in and I draw it so good😊😊😊❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘
I watched the video so I can know what happens in the book cause I’m reading the book right now😊
God bless you
These r the ppl god loves ❤
THat's the heart of a warrior and fighter. Love that cutie<3 That you ma'm and your team for all your efforts in helping her!
I have the dodo book about Sally
Of all the horrible things happening in the world, we need feel good stories like this.
What a cutie ❤
Meet Sally The Dog With Pink Nose
Cute
I think if my legs were 2 inches long, I would also have a fear of water 😂
Watching a puppy struggle to breathe is rough. Good on you.
Amazing video. Sally is so cute. It’s awesome she has a loving family and she is safe. Thank you for sharing ❤️😊🐶
❤❤
Breeders are greedy and evil. A dog is not an accessory. Adopt don’t shop.
This is literally the cutest puppy I’ve ever seen. Everytime this video appears in my fyp her eyes in the thumbnail calls to me!
You can definitely still see that this little dog has breathing problems and always will. You can tell by looking at her chest—it’s quite wide, and she will probably have to use all her accessory breathing muscles just to breathe properly outside. It’s still a miracle that she made it, but make sure to have her checked regularly by a vet. How do I know this? I’m a physiotherapist myself, currently specializing in respiratory therapy.
She is so damn cute it genuinely hurts
Lucky girl
Willing to bet the Grants that pay ppl who do this is drying up now...
Beautiful and sweet❤
That amazing life she a beautiful baby
It's so wonderful that humans will see an animal that is biologically resigned to death and say "no" and do everything we can to get them back to health.
where did her beautiful white spot go on her forehead??? haha sweet baby
she got the kindest moms.
Яке миле Сонечко ❤😘
Cute 😘
I saw her story as a book at my last book fair!
Sad thing is that Peta will come by and say this life saving procedure is unforgivable abuse. You know who you are, Peta.
im crying
Very cute❤❤❤
Very cute❤❤❤
Ugly😮 It’s stupid and up
Ugly😮
You did it Sally! Welcome to the world. Congrats to everyone involved. You are all extra special❤️
Oh man🥲
I just want to let you know I read the book about this and I loved it! ♥️
Thank you for all the patience with this special and adorable baby. I love her.
As someone that suffered lung damage, Sally feels like a kindred spirit to me.  I went from someone that ran a 5k to someone that would wheeze walking from my bedroom to the bathroom - the lung damage was that bad.  I also had debilitating chest pain and chronic respiratory infections.  The beginning required mostly resting (I physically couldn’t do much else) and meds.  Then I took short, slow walks.  Then the walks got longer and I added gentle swimming (no water submersion requiring holding my breath).  What we hoped would take a few weeks or months took over three years, but I’m still grateful.  I still have occasional lung issues, but I can walk normally most of the time and even sometimes jog!  I also haven’t had a respiratory infection for over a year.  When I do get flareups, I watch this video for comfort and inspiration to keep going.  Thank you little Sally, as well as everyone who took care of her and documented her journey. ❤
That’s a lot of work and dedication. She’s a sweetheart and u guys should be proud of ur work!
its dead now
HEROES ❤❤❤
What kind of psychopath down voted this?
I read the book ❤❤❤❤❤❤
God Bless all of you ...
you just made my day

May God bless you for all your efforts

How would you do that with a pitbull? It’s the worse thing when I pup gets that.
why would anyone call that little angel a bad girl
AAAAA SO CUTE , POOR BABYYY
the thumbnail reminded me of Pochita
100% so worth all of the effort put in. oh goodness, seeing her be so tiny and gasping for air and weak just made me start bawling. And now she is a big girl out in the world. it's amazing, and i thank them for being so persistent. she is such a joy and i hope she lives a long and happy life! *sniffs*
the problem with small breeds
What a glorious story God bless the little stinker and you for helping her 1❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
God bless all the people that save rescue and work with animals truest gods work 😊
Thank you so much, for helping her, there'll be a special place in heaven for you. bless you
I was born with a birth defect that caused everything that went in my mouth to go straight into my lungs. So, I relate to her problems & am still dealing with the side effects 56 years later. I am so happy all of you were there to help her survive. Thank you for sharing her precious story.
I love Sally 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Even when she needed her bubble her tail was still wagging🥺🥺
🥰
What a little cutie ❤❤❤
I’m crying right now this story is so beautiful
SHES AMAZING!
What breed is that its so cute
BUBBLE PUPPY!!!!
Can we get an update for that pup?
Thank you for all the time and hard work you put into this little lady. She is beyond precious. Live long and prosper Sally🫶🏼
Thanks for not giving up on her.
that thumbnail is truly the cutest thing ever
Her little howls!!!
I have the book and I showed my freind and he instantly fell in love with her😂 then I said she has a loving home! And he said I hope she can be okay! 6:58
ADORABLE
🥳🐶🐶
She a good girl
She's so cute it hurts my heart 🥹
amazing people
It’s been 2 years what’s the update on her?
She’s so precious! ❤
It’s my favorite book
Do we know what was wrong with her
SHE IS THE CUTEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN.  Edit: Sorry to my cat, but it's true.
🙏♥️🙏
sweet angel!! so glad she had loving caretakers
She’s having such a happy life, great work
Hello, it have a question. Where would she go toilet? Very cute puppy by the way 😅

😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😰😥🥺🥺🥹
The cuteness is INSANE 🥰😍🥹
So precious🥺
That's one flammable dog
Ypu guys are awesome ❤
I don’t know how many times I’ve watched this, nor do I know how many times I will continue to. This is just the sweetest heartwarming story.
This is the most cutest dog I’ve seen I have
You see so many dogs online... but as I saw the thumbnail of this video, I immediately said "that's Sally!", I remember donating for her years ago, and her story and adorable little face stuck with me. Hope you're doing well, girlie pop ❤
the little wag of her going to the bubble like she is saying "yay, my safe space"
Such a beautiful creature
You can’t keep a dachshund down!
What kind of job do you have to rehab a pup and pay bills
Oh my lord, she's so adorable. Such an angel! I love her
The thumbnail was sad
💚💙💗💜
My 6 year old and I just finished the book on Sally's story. So excited to see the interview we read about!
It's amazing i like your video
Nice McGuyver job on the bigger oxygen chamber!
This is supposed to be an emotional story by Geico memes have made it so this video ended up being unintentional comedy.
I'M NOT CRYING YOU ALL ARE
Absolutely gorgeous little girl. Your family's patience, perseverance, and love afforded her a quality of life that nobody initially thought possible. Love is amazing.
i love this dog i seen this when it frist came out and i still love it to this day
❤
these people have a lot of patience and time. this pup was very sick. i'm surprised it survived.
JESUS CHRIST BLESS THIS INNOCENT BEAUTIFUL SUFFERING PUPPY, HEAL HIM SOON, GIVE HIM LOVING CARING OWNER AND REAL FOREVER HOME ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m 32 and I cried a little bit this is such an awesome story it really hits home In the feels
Man, that's just beautiful!!! ❤️
This made me cry and sally is just adorable I wish I could have her right now I’m still crying it’s the cutest thing ever
You are very pretty
sweet baby
Precious Sally - what a little fighter 😃 your work and commitment to her needs are more than commendable. You are the example of what it means to genuinely CARE for innocent animals in need. I also appreciate Bonnie for being the next angel in line. Sally may have experienced hardships with her breathing, but at least her little life has NEVER been without love.  Blessings to you all from Missouri ♥️🐶♥️🐶♥️🐶♥️
How precious and beautifull the both of you thank you for saving her God love you both
It's been 2 years I really hope she's alive and well!
She reminds me of sky from paw patrol
Never give up , stay positive
Adorable puppy.
Dogs with little stumps for legs cannot swim..they will drown.
To be honest, i never really had a good childhood. I experience depression many times, lust, and etc.. But guess what? HE STILL CARED FOR ME! EVEN YOU. HE LOVES YOU. He even saw me sinning, YET HE STILL FORGIVED ME. PLEASE REPENT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. LIFE CAN BE HARD, BUT HE'S STILL HERE TO HELP YOU.  Listen. I do adultery when i was a child, cuz of worldly things. Then i experience depression on 7. Then i keep thinking about wrong things at 8 and 9. And..God helped me again.  He gave me the happiness i never think i could have. I prayed, fasted. And he asnwered my prayers.  He helped me on hard times He gave me the ability, and talent i always prayed for.   Yet i used the writing talent from God, the wrong way.   Yet i keep covet, because the hobby He gave wasn't enough.   Sometimes i can fail, and just want things other people have. Sometimes I'm not grateful.   But He still helped me, again.  And that's His love for us. He saw you sin, yet still forgived us. We treated Him like a toy, and fail him. He already died on the cross for us.   Yet we keep sinning.   Please stop failling Him, people. We got the love we don't even deserve. He still helped us.   Please.   I repented many times, and sometimes i can fail. But that doesn't mean God will just leave you, because you sinned "too much", or whatever. He will try to help you, and you need to listen. Even though if there's ups, and down, i know we all can do it. We can do anything through God, everything is possible.  Don't fall for the tricks from the devil. Don't do worldly things. Faith without works is dead. Repent before it's too late, because it might be too late. Don't focus when will salvation happened, instead, focus on God more. Fast, pray, do His commands. Trust, and it will happened. Anything compared to God's love, is nothing. He will help you if you're depressed.   There's things that Christians should NOT say, for example ; i swear, i can't, what the -, bad words, mocking His name, oh my (-.) (God's name), saying His name in vain, judging people, lying, karma, lucky, etc. These are not allowed, and is breaking God's rules.  Also as an Christian, we must be patient, care and love for each other, spread gospel, respect (other religion, people, parents, anything.), not jealous, and humble. [Going to church is important, it can help your faith. Because social as an Christian is pretty important. There's important things you might find out, that you didn't know from the Bible.]  And even smallest things! Wait for people who's talking to complete what they're saying, helping someone who needed our help, invite someone to go to church. Don't be afraid to spread the gospel, i used to experience that, but it can save someone who needed His help. You can practice love, by helping your parents/doing their commands, pray for people who needs it ;  even your enemies. Doing these is the same as loving God.   Don't let talents, electric things (phone, tv, whatever), lust / adultery, other god, and etc above God! I know it might be hard, but we need to stop. How? Pray to God to give the things you needed to stop doing the sins, ask Him to help you, and fast, and you can spend your free time spending with family, and fast.   Don't make harsh jokes that might hurt someone, or dirty jokes, etc  Don't covet / don't be jealous. We need to learn to be grateful for what God have given us.   Don't be greedy, spare for people who needed these. And it can hurt people too.   Don't lie, spread rumors. We need to be careful by what we're gonna say  Careful with what we're seeing, saying, hearing, doing, or whatever.   Be humble / don't do pride  Close the door when you're about to pray, or fast.   Don't be addicted, or do adultery. Adultery is doing something dirty. Addicted can be about your electrical things, alcohol, dru*s, smoking.   Be careful and don't try to say other god's name. And dont praise other god than Him.   Don't kill innocent people  • Good deeds won't take you to heaven. •  Let God do the work sometimes  Don't believe in luck or karma  Don't lie. • It will not end good. •  Even if it hurts, it makes you closer to God.   Don't be lazy. Don't sleep too much, don't play mobile too long.   If you're sad, or feel like you're going to do something wrong. Immediately pray to God! Ask for help!  Remember, we can't do things without God. Every asnwer to do things is God. We can't repent without His name.  Please repent before it's too late.  If you're sad, He's always here.  If you're sick, may God heal you.  • Please don't give up. Venting to God can help. Life  can be hard sometimes, and I'm sorry if you're struggling. • He loves you no matter what.  If you repent, He will forgive you.  We need to let the past be the past, and change ourselves for God.  Don't compare anyone, or even yourself.  We all have worth No one is perfect except God.   We need His help  God bless you :)   Spread the gospel, everyone. Don't be afraid. Because it might save someone.
He's got immunities!!   Bubble Boy (2001)
I want her
How long did you have her until she was adopted
she is SOO CUTE ❤❤
I just finished the book Sally’s story!
That’s me when I try to go inside out of my room😮
Amazing "fighter for life" God bless her🧡💕😘🙏
What kind of puppy is she?
7:10 the lil’ jump! ❤❤❤
I love watching this video
She’s so precious ❤❤ So happy you all gave her what she needed 😍🥰So happy Bonnie a technition adopted her. She’s so precious 😘😘💕💕
How is she doing lately
This broke my heart .. I am SO GLAD that people are out there saving these precious babies ... I rescued mine form a drug induced couple ... who would mistreat her .. she IS MY WORLD. I wake up with her, and she cleans my entire face and head ... she is sad that I have to go to work, but accepts it, and when I get home , it's amazing ... I give her a full body rub down as she is "cleaning" my face and head ... I give her space, and make sure she has what she NEEDS. She is my best little friend EVER, and I make sure she KNOWS that ... and she , in return, makes sure I know it as well .... I have queen sized bed , and she owns 75% of it lol.. I have learned thru owning other doggos to recognize in my sleep when I am encountering them ...  and she knows this as well ... sometimes it's  full body pressing, sometimes it's a leg, and sometimes it's just a paw to know where I am ( I am restless in my sleep, she knows this as well)... I make at least three types of beds for her on my bed , and my brothers elderly doggo too, who also sleeps with ME ... lol .... my dog sleeps above covers , being along haired breed and my bros dog sleeps under the covers with me being a short haired breed... love them both , and it makes my bro jealous that his doggo sleeps with me ... lol  But thank you for giving this little doggo the chance to breath and experience life ! Much respect! ( Even though this is a 2 year old video)

What an awesome story🙏🦴🐾🥰🫠🐕🐶❤️🤍💙🦅🗽🇺🇲
That's dope long live to sally
I read the book
I read this whole book last week
I got the same book. It’s so sad and wonderful at the same time. I love you sad cheerful stories, and I read the one that how the dog learned how to walk again.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤
Omg I got the book of this!!
God bless this beautiful baby angel ❤ sooooooo adorable and precious .. little lady
Poor dog has to go to the  hospital  and God  bless you  dog
0:44 the lil gasping faces 🥺
Shes so adorable 😭 I really want a dog like her, what breed is she?
I bought the book and I absolutely love Sally.🐕
Y'all are going to be held accountable for being involved in the illuminati Freemason's Epstein Network and you're gonna give back what you stole from me too
Is sally a daschund?
She's beautiful! ❤
❤😊stay care😇
That woman will make a good sexy mother some day 😊
She’s a wittle baby!!! So cute!!
I just got that same book  my mom just got it for me
She's adorable but she kind of looks like the chainsaw pup
1:28  hey! I bought your book about Sally at the book fair today! It’s really interesting and sad at the same time. I feel heart broken and I am so glad she is healing bit by bit she is gaining her oxygen back. Sally is adorable. I don’t have any long haired, short haired, or wired haired dachshunds of my own but I would like to be a vet when I grow up so I will probably witness some in my future. Sally is growing so fast, I really wish I had a dachshund but I only have a Yorkshire Terrier named Arlo 4 months old. and in the passed I had a Jack Russel Terrier named Beatrice 13 years old until she died September 28th 2023 caused of a serious concussion, if she was still here she would be 14 right now.
Dog breed?
This shows that every life is worth it!
No way I could give her up. So sweet
This is such a happy ending and I’m so happy they never gave up on sally!
Bless the children of the world. Love concurs all ❤️❤️
I am a 8 year old and I have 40 pups and 20 cats
Help I would’ve called her Bubble Guppy the Bubble Puppy 😭
I bought Sally’s Story from my daughter’s school’s book fair.  We’ve been reading it every night before bed!
I love the cicadas in the background, I think they’re cool!
In the book I remember when it said you’re a bad girl 😊
I've learned so much from watching The Wizard of Paws, Bionic Pets.the owner makes custom prosthetics & wheelchairs for all types of animals. Dereck's amazing. As Macie's mom pointed out, other joints and her spine can suffer excessive wear & tear from overcompensating for awkward mobility.
Three words ,she is pawsome.
Can I adopt her
I have the book *sally story* I got it from the book fair and this is the BEST story ever ❤😢
It a wiener dog this all time!
I just finished the book 5 minutes ago i feel in love with this baby girl!
❤
Can someone please tell me what kind of breed Sally is?
the chainsaw pup
She is so cute
I got the book of Sally’s story I am going to start reading it soon
Most people would find the task of doing this for their human family members difficult. This is phenomenal dedication. 🫡
Omg I have the book about Sally it's called Sally's story❤❤❤❤
This got turned into a book at my book fair

Hard not to get emotional watching this. So glad it had a happy ending.
I got the book and I am on chapter 9 so yea I have been wanting to see the vid ❤
Just kne word AMAZING❤❤
IM EXCITED FOR THE NEW BOOK ❤❤
That makes me wanna cry
Sally is one of my favorite stories. I watch her each time her video is on the dodo. Her success story is wonderful and it makes me wish I hadn't lost my little special needs dog. (I'm on oxygen too and I couldn't help but laugh when I heard their concentrator. Those are big, honkin' machines that make oxygen out of the air, but they're old and gigantic and they sound like you're running a motorcycle in your house!) Here's hoping that little Sally is still living her best life!
There was a time I wanted to be a vet but I can’t handle animals dying 😢 I love them too much
Wonderful people! Be blessed ❤
So cute when dally goes in the pool, this is the best video. Bought the book!
What a cutie ❤
Good job kat and devin
She is so cute❤❤❤❤❤
The beginning broke my heart to see her condition. But I’m so relieved she grew stronger where she could finally leave that bubble. Bless these people for giving this little Angel a fighting chance at life. Thank you. ❤

May the lord bless you
Sally is a trooper! She is my new wallpaper!

Its incredible to see how acurately and effectively she can self-regulate! She knows exactly when she needs oxygen, or needs to take a break, and immediately does so.

Bad girl sally😂 6:43
I would live in the bubble do work zoom meeting in the bubble eating in the bubble sleeping in the bubble. I love her
Sally's story is nothing short of pure love. Thank you for saving her.❤❤❤
This video is so emotional for me now. Its a little odd to think of. I used to think this video was adorable, and i always felt bad for the puppy. Now i relate to her. I caught pneumonia this year because i aspirated some water. I was sick for three weeks with my local hospital's incorrect treatment. I went into hypoxic respiratory failure and had to be admitted to another hospital a couple of hours away. It felt like being trapped in my ownnlittle bubble. I wasnt allowed to get out of bed for my first four days; i was on seven oxygen treatments.  By day five i was itching so badly to get up and move around that they finally let me. From there i just started getting better and better. Sometimes, its still a little hard to breathe, but i appreciate the little things more now. Thats how i imagine this puppy feels. Everything must be such a wonder for her.
This video gives me hope for humans. How we treat our fur babies says so much about us all! These people are so wonderful. Thanks for a great happy story.
❤🐕
She’s so cute. I feel so bad.  :<

the puppy is the real life pochita
She’s still alive❤ hope she’s big and nice
Hace tiempo que sigo este canal y me emociono con cada historia, pero es una pena que solo esté en inglés, por favor traduzcan,  América Latina y demas paises de habla castellana agradecidos desde ya.- 😃
So much respect to people who foster dogs that needed special care! My dog have a sensitive stomach, somedays after disinfecting the floor for the 5th time, I felt like I was having a mental breakdown (I have ADHD and gets overwhelmed easily). I would love to help more dogs unfortunately I can't even help myself somedays. Sally is tiny but strong, hope she lives a good life!
Our little girl had degenerative heart disease and she needed oxygen therapy several times. Every time was heart breaking, because she was a cuddle bug. Every time I see this video, I'm reminded of our little Paddy's resolve to keep moving forward in life. We lost her to the disease, but this little dog always brings a smile to my face and makes me think about all the good times we had.
The thumbnail makes it look like Pochita
2:49 Really? The dogs too??  Smh 💅
So beautiful, the will to survive is... I remember watching this a year ago. And seeing that same will in my  little Fed Henry. He's still with us...
Amazing when you don’t give up
Good thing she started liking water because theres not a dry eye in the house.
I love this video more
this video motivated ME
I liked seeing how long Sally’s snout got
what breed is she she’s adorable 😭🙏
Incredible story 👏. Thank you for your kindness ❤
Humans need to stop trying to play God and let natural selection happen
🥺 Thank you for saving this beautiful puppy. ✝️🙏🏼🐶❤
Thanks for saving this cute baby
I think this dog had more than just breathing problems, it was anxiety. What these vets did was get her comfortable with the outside world little by little until she felt confident and more comfortable being outside for good. That bubble gave her security that she did not have before. She was able to develop trust with the vet and even the outside...The vets literally healed her more than physically, the vet healed her mentally maybe even spiritually too. This is so cute and heartwarming.
at first I bet you guys didn’t think she would make it. But u kept trying and letting her out of her chamber that’s what makes me tear up she is big and strong may god be with her❤
🇫🇮😟
Such a sweet story. A miracle! This is life at its finest.
So cute❤
Ooh myyy.... This is sooooo beautiful. 🥺🥺🥺
0:44 :O :l :O :l :O :l
😃😃😃😃😃 !!!
i wish women thought i was as cute as that puppy
I can’t even watch this because I’ll just start crying 😭
This is what YouTube is all about.
It’s like the puppy has asthma
Moral of the story:never give up
That poor baby going through that 😢❤
You are a Hero!!!!
THIS PUPPY IS SO CUTE I NEED TO PET HERRR

5:08 “NO I WANT TO GO TO BIG DOGS THERE MY FRIENDS"
What kind of dog breed is this?
Bubble puppy!!!
😭😭😭
Such a precious baby, shes so pretty! Made me cry so many times.
SHES LIKE A LITTLE NUGGET SHEs SOO CUTEEE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
*A breeder that didn't WANT to take care for her, when it was their responsibility!!!
❤️
This reminds me of Eli, The movie he also lived in a bubble!❤
I thought this would be yet another beautiful moment of eyebleach until I was betrayed by another creature at 2:50.. Maybe OPI would be willing to do a sponsorship😂🤣😂🤣
Reminds me of this one Fanboy and Chum Chum episode (no idea how I remember it, last watched that show as a little kid) where this dude was allergic to everything so he lived in this bubble. When he came out, he immediately collapsed. So happy this dog is doing so well!
Angel baby.💕
But he’s not he’s pretty small you know he is about like 10 pounds 12 pounds maybe so yeah a little bit bigger than he was one when we first got him good thing he’s only small because he loves to sit on you you know and if he was the size he should’ve been You know if he was supposed to be the size he should be  You would probably have a collapsed lung or a punctured kidney or something because he would be very very very heavy. You know you wouldn’t be able to breathe. Sits on my grandmother every morning forever and he sits on her every night before bed and that’s why I’m saying he’s only small And that’s a good thing otherwise  My grandmother would probably be dead by now or at least badly hurt because he would be so so so so so heavy you know it would be like having a saint Bernard sitting on your lap or a golden retriever sitting on your lap and laying right on you you know  Your ribs I’m not lying with crack and then they would probably be broken. You know.
Finnegan was also the run so even though he is ragdoll/Norwegian forest cat He’s not very big like he’s just all like he’s just all fur and if you shaved him down, he would look like a rat he would be that small pretty close anyway  If you cut his hair down if he took him to a groomer and they cut his hair, gave him a nice haircut he would probably be still the same size as he was at six weeks old when we got them, that’s how small he is  And norm a ragdoll and Norwegian force cat separately is huge. They are gigantic cats if you put them together and made one cat the normally they would be I think the size of like a Havanese dog you know they would be even bigger than that because I think Havanese dogs are like 15 pounds well 15 pounds is not that big. I think just a ragdoll alone is like 18 or 19 pounds.  So if you put a ragdoll/NFC together you would think they would be well Finning in anyway you would think Finnegan would be close to 30 pounds maybe you know
And you know the lady that had the mother cat that gave birth to him. Her two cats were ragdoll cats. I remember their names. The father was cotton. The mother was Evita and we named our ragdoll noodles and his half brother, his name is Finnegan. He’s a ragdoll/Norwegian forest cat And you know both were very, very, very unique in their own way because noodles and Finnegan were like very very very inseparable for 15 years  Because I remember when Finnegan chose me to take him home one time when we first went to see about getting a ragdoll cat and there were a lot of ragdoll/Norwegian forest kittens there and Finnegan really really really liked me for some reason  But out of all the cats and kittens that were there that were his siblings noodles and Finnegan took very, very, very good liking to each other you know, for some reason there was quite a few cats there that were his biological siblings and for some reason noodles and Finnegan took a loving to each other You know  They never fought even for 15 years. You know the only thing is when Finnegan got older and he didn’t wanna play anymore like around maybe 13 or 14 years old maybe 12 or 13 I think he would kind of get really mad but not like he didn’t attack him or anything. He just looked at him.  The only thing he would’ve been and not wanted him around with a shopping bag if my grandmother put a shopping bag on the floor and noodles came around he would get really possessive around it. Finnegan absolutely loves bags to the point where he won’t allow any cat or something to be near it you know.  Like me with my phone when I’m on my iPhone or iPad or any kind of phone you know soon as I hear somebody coming around I get snappy you know I am not a very happy camper. You know I like to be interrupted when I’m on my social media whether it’s on my phone or on my iPad , I like to come down when I’m ready you know and go back up and go on it whenever I’m ready  Majority of the time that does happen you know unless I have things that I gotta do like the table at dinner time I have something that I have to do during the day but it’s still I don’t like it. I don’t like being interrupted when I’m on my phone or my iPad I get very, very, very possessive and angry  Well, Finans like that with a bag he’s that way with his bags that he likes to go in when we empty the food from the shopping bags he loves to go in the bag and he didn’t like his brother going anywhere near that bag even if he wasn’t near it and if he was just in the room, he would chase him downstairs. He would chase him away you know  Noodles is a ragdoll cat he’s not aggressive. He’s not a fighter. He won’t fight back. You know you know he would just go downstairs. He would try to get away from the situation. He’s not a fighter at all.   He was a runner you know because every time when you went to open the door to go outside, he tried to get out side you know other then the fact that Finnegan he own the bag, they never really fought, and I don’t really think that Finnegan was trying to fight with him over that I think that he was just possessive of the shopping bag  But other than that, they were never seen far apart from each other, even if they didn’t exactly lie and sleep, touching each other anymore as Finnegan got older, they were always in that room together you know like noodles would be in this spot like the dog bed and one of the chairs and then Finnegan would be in another chair sleeping  Yeah, when they used to eat noodles would be the boss over food because noodles will be done eating and Finnegan wasn’t and he was still hungry. Finnegan would kinda like back off and let noodles eat off his plate Finnegan would reach in with his paw and kind of like scoop a little bit out  Because he was letting noodles eat off his plate, you know which was very, very, very cute to watch
I remember you know one of my cats just passed away at 15 years old, but when we first got him, he was born without one nasal passage opening like just one nasal passage didn’t open properly so he lived for 15 years with 30% breathing in one nostril you know that was after surgery  And he was fine. He was healthy. You know nothing wrong with the cat at all you know you probably would think how does he walk and not run out of air because of his lack of air quality  And you know what right now I’m asking this same question you know because you know when you walk or run you often have to breathe, but maybe he used his nose that had 100% airway to breathe maybe he somehow was able to use his other side of his nostril to breathe and I think that’s what he did
But sometimes if the people cared about their animals and couldn’t look after them would normally leave them in front of a store or at a person doorstep you know where they can be discovered and then somebody could take care of them you know  If they’re not throwing out the door in the middle of nowhere, then they would normally get dropped off in front of our store or at a person doorstep that normally says that the person is embarrassed to ask for help, but it still deeply caring and kindhearted you know and that they do really care enough because they want people to find them. They want somebody to discover them so that they can get a good home one day.  But you never hear about a breeder contacting your rescue organization for help and you know it takes a really, really really strong breeder to do the right thing you know I bet you deer was probably embarrassed you know
That’s what most people would do but a lot of them do leave them on the side of the road and takes a long time for them to find because I have to drive. God knows how long you know 80 or 90 miles just to save a few puppies or kittens that somebody just decided to, throw away  Sometimes people just don’t wanna deal with the health issues and they figure oh just leave them there so that nobody would have to find them you know
I have seen a lot of puppies and that being abandoned like when rescue organizations find puppies that are abandoned they often have health problems, and when people abandon the dogs from being bread it means that they normally have health issues and they’re embarrassed to reach out for help you know so they just leave them on the side of the road or something  I wouldn’t mind if people left their puppies somewhere like in front of a store or somebody else’s doorstep you know because it means that dirt embarrassed to reach out for help but they’re also caring enough for the puppies you know  If they leave them on somebody’s doorstep with a note of some kind and maybe a bowl with a bag of food or something sometimes they do that and it will show that they really do care about them but with their situation, maybe they’re embarrassed to reach out for help  And some dogs like this one have health issues and maybe they’re too distraught and devastated to even talk to somebody about it you know, but they also care enough about the puppies and kittens to leave them on somebody’s doorstep or in front of a store where they can be seen quicker and they eventually get a home
Update por favor!
Fish out of water type dog
she ia so cute😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤
Omg I love sally ❤❤
My senior pup left this world while having to be on oxygen so this makes me a little sad but overall happy we have technology to help these precious creatures. <3
Blessings, Pray doggy Sally be strengthen strong healthyhappy always,. amen

Ol girl at the 10min mark absolutely caked up
SHES SO CUTE
My face this whole video:🥹
STOP BREEEDING DOGS!!!!!
I am curious what concentration you had the oxygen tent at. I have been told that high concentration of oxygen can damage humans eyes, and if so was there any negatives to being in an high oxygen environment for her?
What kind of dog is she I want one
I love the human spirit so much taking all that time and effort for this pure dog thanks to all of the people that helped made my day
Such a smart little pup.
She even has derpy eyes, so cute🥰
sadly most runts never make it... glad she was able too as others do not have that kind fortune to be given that chance.
A kind heart fought for another kind heart  Bless them both and all that helped on her journey
She is so cute fight for The small lives ❤
6:15 the way she looks up after that was said lol

Omg what a little angel. How cant u love her❤❤❤
She did such a good job to save a life... it's an impossible work she did! The amount of time she took to care for this little being can really warms my heart. She's an angel <3
I hope she gets all the treats, cuddles, and love she deserves! Stay strong! ❤
He reminded me of David vetter who lives in a bubble as well as Donald from seinfeld he's a boy who lives In a bubble
What a fighter! Made me cry bubbles. If only I would’ve adopted her, I would name her Bubble.   Sally, I wish you are thriving to this day. 💛

Please spay & neuter.
Such a pretty. Puppy so adorable
She is so precious and amazing.  Dogs are truly special.  Let us all give them a chance to live.  Great story.  Very inspiring.
Look at her being such a big girl! So precious I love animals so much we started fostering a baby bird that fell out of one of the trees in back yard ! My heart is just too big to leave any helpless creature behind
Well there's your problem. Oxygen weakens your lungs
Humans can do amazing things. Dogs knew that before homosapians ever did.
Of all the dogs in all the dog villages, this is the cutest
I can tell she has good care takers, she seems very happy and content.
Honestly this is like a disney pixar movie lol
Keep doing great please
Wow  sally is so cute
CAN I JUST ADOPT THIS LITTLE GIRL OMG 😭😭😭
Oh c'mon, who is cutting onions again ?!
Praise you God.
Too Cuuute!!!❤
Breeders awful
she’s so adorable ❤
You guys have such huge hearts! God Bless you for giving her love & care!!
I love thiss story because the caretakers are like: ''Sally, you need oxygen!'' And Sally is like: ''Nuh-uh.''
Shes so precious! And you took great care of her :]
She’s so beautiful God bless her and the people who didn't give up on her 💞
My freaken heart AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 🥺💙
I’ve never stopped watching this same video every time I want to find this YouTube account I just look up the bubble puppy and I watch this video over and over again and I’m just so glad that god gave her a second chance in life
Thank you all for helping her . She’s so sweet. Without you she couldn’t have survived. The great thing is you let her conquer her problem in her own time . I wish her the happiest life . ❤
She is so cute! ❤
8:00 Feet
I hope Sally thrives for as long as possible. She's a sweetheart 😘
She is so adorable, glad you able to make her have a normal life
if she learned where her oxygen was, maybe a tight seal doggy door wouldve been great for her
😭😭😭😭😭😭
I dont think animals exactly have feminity but that puppy just screams little girl. So perfrctly cute.
It’s very abusive to keep an animal alive that suffers everyday if they cannot be cured.
A good person bless you thank you for helping do you say the dog
I’m crying because of that that’s so cute
Blessed is she who,in the name of charity and good will,shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness.For she is truly her sisters keeper and the finder of lost children😇
i love veterinarians, just showing up every day and coming up with creative solutions for the littlest babs🥰
That's the best video I have ever seen❤🥺
What a precious little baby.  When I saw you guys make a new bubble for her it made me tear up.
Im at a point in my life where even at my lowest points I just cant cry at all. I can cry when I think of how much I love my family...but also this. These animal rescue videos make me cry in no time. God damn theyre beautiful. Thank you for giving them another chance. I know from both 1st and 2nd hand experience that you dont always get a second chance.  Truly kind people are rare to come by.
Sally is so, Sally is so adorable thank you for taking such great care of her. I love her is she up for adoption, if she has, I would be interested if she still available ❤. Thank you again.🙏
Oh my I love her! Such a naughty baby girl! 6:43
Gosh thank you, thank you for saving Sally. I know she’s a special one. Sally is a sunshine, she is beautiful! 😚
Adopt, dont shop.
Asthma as a kid and young adult ... It's truly Amazing you were able to "grow" her OUT of this predicament. I'm so very happy she is doing so well ... thanks for the patience ... Long Life to ALL!!🎉😊😊
Cutie pie ❤
I think the water is not a good ideafor hé. Hér lungs will enver be normal. A little inhaléd water could do hér in
This is such a miraculous and heartwarming story. This is exactly why abortion is wrong, because if we give anyone a chance, they will live and enjoy the life that they deserve.
😊 she reminds me of my kitten Oppie
Aww that is just so cute and adorable
My mom saw this and she almost cried, but asked me why I never told her  watched this before over and over again
I LOVE dachshunds!  ❤❤❤
What a great story. Thank God for good people like y'all who care so much for animals to save little fur babies like this little girl. 💗🙏🐕🙏💗
I love the thumbnail
This is why I love dachshunds.
EVERY animal, no matter the species, preferred or not, treated as a friend or a resource for humans, is a unique,feeling individual with a personality, preferences, friends, a desire to live! They are as sentient as we are in every way that matters morally.We must respect their moral birthrights that we, as sentient beings also have, to not be used, harmed or killed for human purposes. BE VEGAN for them all! We are their only hope. 💚
I’m bawling.
God bless you for saving and hard working to save Sally ❤❤❤❤
She looks so much like pochita in chainsaw man
😅😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
The mightiest and cutest bubble pup ever.
This is just amazing. Thank you for caring for her and finding her a home
She's so sweet❤
The hardest thing in the world must have been not being able to open the bubble and hug and squeeze her to pieces.
why waste so many resources on an animal 🤣
this is just such a heartwarming and inspiring story, thank you!!
Beautiful story! How precious! I truly believe God gives back what he takes away in another form. The breaths that puppy had taken away were given back in the form of an amazing family. God bless all of you!:)

You guys are awesome. Simple...
What breed is she ?
im the 8000 comment :)
Cute Dog ❤
I can't even imagine how heart breaking it must have been for them to see this sweet little puppy fighting for her life, but not be able to comfort her with cuddles or holding her. It actually kind of makes me want to cry. They did such an incredible job with this sweet little girl, they were her guardian angels for sure!
Bless her heart
'Though she be but little she is fierce'  What a sweet precious little baby.  I am so happy that she beat the odds with the help of amazing vet techs. And that she learned to love water!!! Truly a little fighter.
when video was in half i started crying but then i was really happy about that puppy i just really love animals
I would hug my dog watching this.
Such loving people!  Thank you for giving her a great life!
I'm sorry but this video deserves a GOLD MEDAL from the dodo. This is one of the MOST Beautiful the dodo stories I have ever seen. ❤️. You guys are that puppy's angels. God bless you all for taking care of this beauty. I felt in love with this puppy since the first time I saw her little face in the video. Thank you so much for giving this beautiful puppy the opportunity to live a fortunate amazing life with all the love. Thank you all so much. I'm writing this with tears in my eyes but tears of joy to see this puppy recuperate and become bubble free and enjoy life to it's fullest. God bless you all.  🙏 ❤️.  Sending much love from California.
She is adorable ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wish this beautiful girl a long happy life devoid of suffering ❤
She is so cute! I wanna pet her so bad!
Having to keep the most adorable looking dog inside a bubble and only being able to pet her for a limited about of time has to be the cruelest form of torture.
The fact she didn't begin to associate the outside world with her pain of not being able to breathe shows how much she wanted to get out.
Did the dog tell you that lol.
Thank you so much to the kind, beautiful spirits who never gave up on Sally
I had a dog named sally. She looked just like this little puppy here, but all black and more sleek.
Aww, I'm so happy for her :)
0:09 That squeal 😭
This is so sweet, i feel lucky that i got to witness this ❤
Best of wishes and hope for the best ❤
She is so precious
A good girl! :)
Sally needs her own Disney Film ❤
She's amazing well done bubble pup❤❤
Chainsaw man!  Reality?
I can’t even imagine someone that would work so hard to keep this little baby alive for as long as you did. It’s unimaginable to think that any human being would have this much tenacity, for something so little. Of course, it’s so important; restoration of humanity. Thank you for putting the work in, a life is a life. For sure this one was saved. ❤
Humanity test: If you go through this video and feel nothing... go look for mental health right now.
Twitter users be like: 2:02 - 2:09
What an adorably brave and strong little girl!
Poor girl. I wish the best for her ❤
9:41 omg her smile
My dog has one of those sqeaky lam toys, she is obsessed with it! I call it lambkins.

Poor puppy... I hope she's doing well now
you know its dramatic when you got old men crying
Im glad they kept trying eith her instead of giving up and I'm glad that it was another vet technician that adopted her because she'd already know what to do if sally had any lung problems. This was such a sweet video. ❤❤❤
I love Sally so much
She's so cute
When sad watch this video that’s what I did ❤️🐶🐾😊 10:22
Bless this sweet angel 😢❤
They should’ve named her bubbles 😭
How did you feed her when she could not come outside of the bubble
John Cena:- Never Give up  Sally:- 🐶
this almost made me cry lmao
Thank you for helping this puppy.
What AMAZING people with huge hearts for taking the time, and making the effort, to care for Sally until she was healthy. A truly beautiful story of love.
Wow absolutely beautiful sally ❤❤❤ and her adoptive mummy yur all amazing how youve all supported her and loved her ❤god bless you all ❤
a mischievous pup is a healthy pup ☺️ seeing her grab the toilet paper made me so happy
This I just amazing it almost made me cry and this puppy she worked so hard to live life and that is just amazing! I have a dog of my own his name is Myles and seeing dogs like this is just so heartbreaking and the way you women just help them out with all your time and patience.. people need to invent a new word to explain how amazing those women are! 😭😊☺️
🥺💝
Aww❤
Angels.
She is so cute I do not want her to run out of oxygen so do not give up bubble puppy and dodo
God bless you for working so hard and keeping her alive ❤❤❤❤ she is beautiful ❤
What a cool story!!!❤
Thank you for loving her that much!!
What a beautiful heart-felt story. Made my day.
I just thought how its called “bubble puppy” it reminded me of bubble guppies idk why but this dog is so cute!❤
She is a warrior! Thank you for fighting with her! She 100% worth it!
Pupper :)
❤❤❤
I CANT NOT SHED A FEW TEARS );
Some people are just chock full of kindness and gentleness. I feel like I need these vids to offset my true crime obsession lol. Nice balance, kind of like a see-saw. Well, maybe more like a pendulum.
Thank God for people like you
MY HEART ❤️ 😍❤️
Call her bubble tea she’s cute hope she survived
Absolutely amazing. Thank god she had good parents who are determined to help her live a good life.
U are amazing!
I'm a cat person but OH MY GOD THIS IS THE CUTEST PUPPY I HAVE SEEN! ♥︎
You guys are so  awesome for taking care of this sweet and cute puppy!
Sequel???!!!
I love her! This is one gorgeous, cuddly, energy fluff ball. And she's the smartest puppy EVER!!!!
She's gorgeous. The caregiver is not too shabby, too.
I'm glad she healed well and is able to enjoy a good life! (Bubble Puppy is also a '60s/'70s rock band! :)
Is this puppy doing fine? I was very sad😔 😟that she had pneumonia, but I am very happy that she is getting great care, while I see bravery in her. 👍I have one question, how is the bubble being carried around?
How were they feeding her? And breeders need to stop, I'm actually dissapointed no one brought up the fact that breeders create dogs that struggle to survive because they want money.
Sad to hear about the loss ❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢😢
I love her !!! She's  so cute ❤❤❤❤
Such a sweet adorable baby!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️Thank you for helping her!!
5:55 I have that exact blanket with the Christmas dogs it’s super comfy and kudos to the people helping out this little puppy
The weird thing is when she couldn’t breath, I stopped breathing.
Crying 🥺🥺🥺
4:59 so cute 6:30
My looking dog
Sally is the cutest puppy I have ever seen.
I cried on this, it's so amazing how patience and care always prove to be beneficial, thankful for these vets they didn't abandon her.
I would name her bubble.
She’s such a strong little girl and she’s so gorgeous! What kind of dog is she, does anyone know?❤
Aww ☺️😊the doggy is so cute 🥰
Absolutely awesome 😎 ❤🎉
Respect
That's one happy little pup. So glad she got the help she needed!
Shouldn't she not have all the clothes on as it would be more constricting?  just wondering 🤷🏾‍♂️
Man just kills you seeing her struggling to breathe 🥺
I am truly touched by their faith in knowing she could pull through! What a wonderful video this is to share and show how to never give up! Rather the one not well or the ones caring for one not well: because this precious angel is well and has a long life because they believed!
But now it is good💕
This is not funny this is sad😭😇💔💓💌
She's so excited and happy. I'm glad they let her be mischievous and go lucky
*adoptable
you've heard of bubble guppies,   but get ready for...                  bubble puppies.
It was so amazing how dogs could bring so much joy and happiness to their owners with their cuteness. Sally was so cute and active, and she knew how to pick her favorite toy at the pet shop, that was such a cute act 😍
This little girl went through a lot and she has a strong heart and God has been there for this little girl. Sally is truly blessed and has been through a lot and she always has a good time. Sally you are a very strong dog and keep pushing for many other little girl dogs like not to quit. 😊❤
The little dog that could
Cute long Haired Dacshund      pup Female
Maybe her condition was gone, but still so cute😊
Yea I got the first thing in and it said it wasn’t good but it just said it just keeps asking for the info
That puppy was so cute!
I love puppies, but my dog died because of heart failure
NEVER BACK DOWN NEVER WHAT?
😭 😭 😭 😭. I’m crying, Sally is so strong!
what brave little baby
<3
So cute
All the doctors  are GREAT HUMAN BEINGS, + a doctors with a very hig heart!
Cutes little puppy I have ever seen <3 <3 Such a fighter too. I'm happy for Sally having the right people in her life to be able to not only survive but thrive!
What a good baby!
You Are A Fighter Sally.....May God Bless You.... Always Be Happy....And Always Be Playful....I Hope You Live The Best Lives Like Other Puppies....❤❤❤❤
I so happy she’s with you guys ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢
0:43 the 2nd reason why she's called a 'bubble puppy'
my faith in humanity doesn't restored, she is god.
I wish that I could hug her!
Oh she's so cute!
I had tears through this story with this beautiful little angel that never gave up. The lady never gave up. This is the most beautiful story. It made my day and I love love people that love animals and take care of them and give them chances to shoulder thrive.  We're God bless you all and God bless that little angel. I hope to meet her some day. I lived in fort myers Florida now i'm in north fort myes.   . My name is Bonzy Galor ❤❤❤❤😮😊 It's just a beautiful thing it's beautiful god bless her And God bless her owners, her angels and that Lou angel has a great-great attitude. Dude, love you and love you all your furry. Babies and prayers with you always. Never give up.
sooooooo adorable baby  xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo, u r a very special human being and thk u very much
I'm so overwhelmed seeing this...❤
Imagine they put the old chamber next to the newer one for memories
Atention is much sensibile/vulnerable,,accidents" ....Is verry good much calm from not touch notting this zone lungs DELICATs !
I love puppies so when I watched this I was in tears. It was very cute though!
What breed is sally?

amazing story! strong dog! what breed is this dog
whats the breed of the bubble puppy ?
What an adorable puppy  and. what wonderful people you are thank you for sharing this video it was truly amazing from Sandra in england ❤ 10:35
Aww this is such an amazing story
cute
Precious baby ;-;
My haert😢❤
This baby puppy was so lucky to be raised by a vet tech and adopted by one. The little oxygen chamber that grew with her was so creative and unique. And it was just so heartwarming to see how they accommodated her needs. Seeing that puppy in respiratory distress, with chest retractions just about broke me, though. It's sad beyond words to think of a little pup getting aspiration pneumonia from nursing. That poor little baby! My heart broke for her when she spent too long outside the bubble and couldn't breathe. How amazing that they never gave up on her. And what a miraculous recovery! PS, it's so cute and funny how dachshunds start out with little short faces and they get long over time. She looked just like my toy poodle did as a puppy.
AWWWW
cutest puppy i ever seen :).
I love you ❤ dog
Such a sweet story! 😍 You made me want to adopt that puppy!! 🐾🐾💕
Ahhh Thanks for that story!!! I worked over 20 years as Respiratory Therapist in a Childrens hospital.
❤❤❤❤❤
Best video ever
Poor baby hope she can breathe on her own soon n I hope she doesn't have any future problems.i hope she gets a loving family and forever homeMay god watch over her n protect her always😃

So sad. I hope she’s not traumatized.
Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuutttttttttttteeeeeeeeee.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
Heroic love.  If we could treat one another with the same compassion all our problems would be slight, indeed.

What's her name?
She the cutest girl I've ever seen!
What happens if she get hurt by big ever think of that.these story's is all about the human look what I did.
I swear I'm not crying 😭
Love the human who never gave on the life... Without ur support that life wouldn't survive. Ur life is certified human❤. Stay love
6:49 Sally has such a cute dress!
I hate her !! She'sssssssss  soo cute !!!!!
I would be a complete helicopter parent. "Don't let her get too tired. Here's her blankie in case she needs a lie down."
was their an aerosolized medicine inside the oxygen? I'm not actually a doctor but I would imagine that with pneumonia, even for a dog, you would need oxygen with aerosolized medicine
She is so stinking cute!
That's a beautifully wonderful story
Omg she is soo cute 🥺
So glad that this little one had the chance to get better.  ❤😮
6:42 is so funny lollll
❤❤❤❤❤
❤
She is so cute😭
I love how sally can now be like a normal dog she doesn’t have to be in her bubble it just like shows that she never gave up
Grasping for air and oxygen
4:38 is the cutest lil jump

What a sweetie!!! Such an amazing story of survival!!!
Is She a  Dachshund
She's such a happy little dog ❤
To have the compassion and patience you had for that baby says a lot. It was life or death for her so thank you for your kind  heart and choosing life for her.❤
Buona vita meravigliosa creatura.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a story.  Everyone is my favorite.  It's so wonderful to see such wonderful caring people.  The kids and other dogs were so good with her.  Sally's a happy girl, and I'm sure she's spreading her joy.   I loved the way you pulled this time line along so that we could all enjoy seeing this. Thank you.
She's soooooo cute🥺   What puppy is she
Could watch these wonderful stories all day long, far,far more loving 🥰kind people out there, than cruel ones!! Thank god🥰👍
May the Lord bless her and keep her safe and healthy and happy in Jesus Christ name I pray amen
What type of dog is she?!
so love this video and I thank you
I've watched this like............20 times this is my 21st time I love this
Fun fact!(not rly) I actually had pneumonia abt the start of February i was in the hospital for 1 month or a bit more when i got out i had to take pills every 7 hours but im alr now Im ok now C=
Also the name of the dog in Bubble Guppies.
the bubble puppy makes me think of "bubble guppies" 😂😂😂😂hes so cute tho
yes i cried.
What breed is she
First of all: the old saying its not the dog in the fight but the fight in the dogs again holds true. that little girl fought hard to be a healthypuppy with your support. and second: having your coworker adopt her was the right decission. she is a vet tech as well so she knows her backstory and what she needs. and sally can keep contact with you so she doesnt loose a friend. :)
Oh my God. What a complete and utter beautiful little girl. The fact that they built the chamber to where they could climb in with her too is just amazing.😊 You know, if we had more people like this, the world would be a better place
3:29 the way she shakes her head!!
Beautiful story
aký zlatý
Aww, the point at which she unconsciously (or subconsciously) knew that her lungs were now healed sufficiently, was so heart-warming. The living organism simply never gives up does it? it will fight for it's existence to the very end. This beautiful little girl made it because of all of your beautiful and caring natures. This had me, a 63-year-old bloke, teared up by the end. Thank you on behalf of her and all the other animals that you help.
does anyone know if this couple that rescues has a personal page? they're my favorite
Thank you to all involved in rehabilitating this sweet baby girl! And I love her name! Please keep us updated!!! 🥰❤️
Thank you so much ❤️🐾🙏she's so cute and precious 🐾
She’s so cute!😭🥹❤️‍🩹
Very beautiful people and beautiful Sally❤
He’s cute loving can’t breath but can keep going😊
This still just makes me so happy. Thanks to this whole channel for another good wholesome video. I was also like that dog tho 😂😂❤
I WANT HER
SOO CUTE POOR THING ❤❤❤❤
That may be the cutest effing dog I've ever seen
I’ve watched this video four different times and I just love it.
God bless you, guys!!!
That is the cutest puppy.
Mom has so much love
She.Is.Adorable.🥺❤💖
this made me cry, what a sweet story. They never gave up on her, when most vets would have euthanised her right away. I’m so happy for her
This is the most beautiful story i have ever seen. Thank goodness for the people in this world who fight hard for these helpless dogs. : )💜💜💜
I’m not crying you are 😭😭😝
I’m not crying you are 😭😭😝
So beautiful 😍❤
I'm glad this dog gets to live the white privilege life
Thank you for giving all these animals a fighting chance in life
What breed of dog is she
Does anybody know what kind of dog she is?
Cutest dog I had ever seen, bless her tiny pup soul.
God bless you amazing people for all that you do to help these dear souls, pets! 😘💖🐾🙏✨
What a sweet and innocent face, i hope this little one continues to thrive. ❤❤❤
OMGGGG IS THAT A DACHSHUNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Sally is like Theodore Roosevelt when he was a kid lol
Is she a wiener dog?
Okay what you do so you can love her even though she's in a bubble is you do what they do on BMT units in hospitals.   Bone marrow transplant recipients have like no functioning immune system so they put you in a bubble and then they have like arm holes with gloves pre attached to it so they can get care.
Poor puppy she's so cute 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 so heartbreaking 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I have a  a drop on my face😢😢😢😢😊
Heart warming😢😊😊😊😊
i love her omg
This is the most positive video I have ever seen
Poor Pup 😢hope its having fun till this day
imma put that dog in the blender.....
You people are doing God's work. Thanks you for reminding me how special all life is
Soooooo gorgeous!
Is soooooooo cute I even like and follow
Oh, I wish I could just kiss her in a little for head I just smack my sister’s forehead, though like give me your for head😂😂😂🥰🥰🥰
I bet she is the one of the most special dogs. She is so adorable like angel. She is too adorable. I was adopted. I will adopt him but someone’s already adopted you. Oh she is so precious. She has trouble breathing but it’s OK. Kind of I don’t know. Oh, she’s just a little precious little angel, what are you going to name her or heat? i’m guessing it’s a girl she’s just so cute licking on the window.😊😊😊😊😊😊🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😘🥰🥰🥰🥰
Cutest thing in the world
Bubble Puppy kicks ASS!
😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤
Ohhhh that poor baby didn’t get to be loved on :( but she looks like she handled it well. Shes so precious
My heart is melting ❤
I was crying my heart out but this made my day...i love this!!!!🥺❤
mmm
is this a normal occurrence for dogs as a  result of breeding? or is the breeder doin some weird experimental breeding type stuff
There has been so much negativity in the world lately so thank you for sharing this heartwarming story to spread some much needed joy.   Congratulations little pupper, you have been so brave and know that you are loved. 🐶
SHE WAS SO CUTE WHEN SHE WAS A BABY!!!❤❤❤

I have so much respect and admiration for those who treat animals with love like the first lady who took her in, and this amazing family as well.   That was so beautiful to watch, I love animals that is why I can't get enough of this channel. thank you for sharing this video with us.  😍😍😍
That's sooo awesome, u are a treasure & so lucky to have a job like that, such an important job. Ok, I'm just gonna say it... I'm jealous.... I am jealous ! Ok now everybody knows, I'm a shallow jealous person lol. U guy's are just pure Awesomeness ! Thank u for everthing u do & for sharing this beautiful story.
Beri cute by kalafish
I'm back for a 2nd time... This time I was thinking about how I'm a bigger dog kind of gal - im not 100% sure I even know Sally's breed. But she's so darn cute that I didn't think about it until the end of the video when she licks her mom's face. 😍🥰
He’s so freaking cute❤❤❤❤❤!!!!!!!!!!🥹
Like
I felt so bad at first but then I was just mike yay she can breath l❤❤❤ I love her she is so cute and beautiful
Sweet girl 😍😍😍😘😘😘
Give her to me!!!
I want a dog!!!!!
Stweet
Awhh 😢😢
I'm so sad
The world is so so so blessed to have her in it . xx 💜🙏🏾🌟
Poor baby aminal
this woman is  a frigging angel for doing this
Those women are angels, thank you for letting that pup live
As someone who had to be on an incubator for the first month of my life, it's great to hear of a success story of a puppy with a similar issue. She's so overwhelmingly cute that it almost physically hurts to look at her!
Sally needs her own YouTube channel!
I cannot get enough of this video. I’m in love with her. What an adorable fighter. ❤ shoot I want to adopt her myself.
I love how they gave her credits at the end😭❤️
Hope she dies hahahah
I'm a tough dude, I work in construction, was an amateur boxer and can say I'm a man's man. I say that to see that this baby made me tear up so hard rooting for her cute little self. I'm so happy she was blessed with those people who had the patience and knowledge to build her strength to live a quality life. God bless you Sally
She's just so adorable I'm dead as a dodo lol. Knowing when she needed to go back inside is amazing.
I don't ever want to sit through this video again, it's a genuinely nerve-wracking story for the first half, and even at the end, I was dreading every change in the music. I'm so glad Sally's alive and healthy. I need to hug my dog.
Omgggg she's so cute!!! ❤❤❤❤
This is the most heartwarming video I have ever seen
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is making me want to cry!
ขอบคุณที่ดูแลน้องอย่างดี

Beautiful story 🩷🩷🩷
The way that doggy walks around!
I love you I hope you get better my love☺️☺️☺️😚😚😚😍😍😷😷
The bigger dogs hot pink nails are so funny😭
The idea of lungs not working is absolutely terrifying. I'm so glad this has a happy ending.
MY HEART HURTS FOR HER.. SHE'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL BABY, GOD BLESS HER.🙏❤️🕊⚘️💖
Just as an fyi, dackel were bread to fight badgers in their burrows, if possible coax them out so that a hunter can take care of the badger. That´s the origin of this breed of dogs. They are a very aggressive and proud race of dogs that only ever listens to their owner, they are also very stubborn, so this little one surviving this ordeal is no surprise to me.
first time I see this video its at least 6 months old but only now Im watching, ah look, just wanted to write that as far as I am able to remember this might be the cutest little furry baby i have EVER seen, like EVER!! thank you all for saving her, shes is beyond ADORABLE so smart so so smart, i just LOVE HER hope shes still thriving and very happy🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Pochita?
When you think about giving up in life, just think of Sally. This had me crying. I'm glad she persevered.
She is beautiful
Aw poor pup
No, the breeder/sex trafficker/slave owner didn't want to spend time and money on ''something'' they're morally obligated to care for having forced their birth. They're cowards that sexually assault animals to make them mothers then abduct their children and sell them into slavery for cash. Anything that isn't in that description, like actually caring about them, they don't care about, cos doing the right thing isn't in their vocabulary. They take advantage of those they can manipulate and their misfortune, when that ''thing'' they breed starts taking advantage of them they get rid of them like a coward.
Even though she suffered for oxygen she is a cute puppy 😊❤
Why do women treat dogs so well but cut part of their baby’s penis off?
RIP🕊🕊
Get well soon everyone❤️‍🩹
Get well soon❤️‍🩹
Best story ever!!!! Sally will live a long happy life
I noticed that Sally has different colored eyes.
I hope they named her bubbles ❤
I need her 😢😂😂😂😂😂
GIVE ME THE DOG
No no stop stop chewing on the air tube u silly girl (later) no no stop stop messing with the toilet paper u silly girl
She’s so beautiful I hope she gets better
I have bad asthma and this just made me sad:( poor thing.
Truly speechless with few tears, actually too much tears. I live in a desert and always dusty which makes me tears that's all😢
So sad😫😫😫😥😥😥😪😪😪😪😪😯😯😯
Man really just woke up one day and said  🐶💨       🫧
isnt that T he dog ryans gf has omg THE FOG IS COMING
what breed????
She should be ashamed. She should have given all that money to families who don't have health insurance to take care of their children. Some people have lost their sense of priorities. Here in Europe people wouldn't dare to act like that...
Came from breeder..... Thats the issue.
So cute
She so cute
Sally is so brave and never even gave up and her courage led her to living the best life
I want to adopt her
What breed is she
I latterly need that dog sheeeesss so cuteeeeeeeeeeee 😢😊
😇🎆🎆🎆
Thank you for having faith In Sally. It was a long haul but she is resilient.  ❤❤❤
No ur not my mom she out ther please fiand her help me please imcring for her she tolkto me week  go online fiand her voice let me hear her voice
No not her no no not her
You all make me sick, literally. The same way if I stay here and talked about blood and gore to you. This may come as a surprise to some of you but there are people in this world that don't give a rat's f****** ass about dumb ass animals. As a matter of fact I don't give a f*** about anyting further away from me my face. I don't have to, I'm not a******, I love animals when they're not shoved in my f****** face and I'm forced to love them because some assholes wants to reveal cuteness to me that I didn't ask for. F*** all of you people and everything you stand for. The same as you tell me. And f*** all of you for not seeing beauty in things that don't have gigantic eyes and hair everywhere on their body.
Your a good person this made me cry and then be happy.
Now that's a cutie...
I am just seeing this now, 4/21.2023 WHAT AN ABSOLUTE ANGEL OF GOD, this little sweetie Sally,  and St. Francis of Assissi, , the patron saint of animals! THANK YOU for ALL  you are doing for this sweet pup! BLESS YOU ALL. Kim
❤ Thank you so much for this story.
I couldn’t have given her up she’s so precious. I definitely would have kept her forever.
I had a puppie like this his name was prince sammy the only boy in his litter he died at a week and a day…he’s the only boy in his litter
i just see this and i wanna cry this dog make me remind my old dog that my parents bought when i was born this dog name ma-le in thai it a flower name she passed away 3 yeat ago but the memory will stay with me forever i love her best dog i ever met.

Sally has grown so much! She is so strong and ready to take on the world! I'm so glad the bubble dog is now enjoying life outside her bubble!
Thats the sadest happy story I’ve ever heard
precious baby
It’s beautiful to see how much love people have to give ❤❤❤
That breeder should stop making money out of animals if he isn't capable to nurse an oddball.
4:49  "do you wanna come back out?"   SHE DID A LIL NOD
Dude I cried
What a beautiful precious dog! I hope she stays happy and healthy for the rest of her❤❤❤
This is why “breeders” are ridiculous making profit off of sickly dogs they produced
Just a  little hard I'm fine tho
Well I can still breath
Bad
This feels like me right now bc I have a b😢ad cough
Cool...thank You for taking care of that lil dog.....if you wouldn't have that puppy would have been in the dirt

Cannot thank you enough." What an  inconvenience!" some would say. While some would believe there is no other option - period. Blessings to the humans for loving Sally.
It's to cute😭😭😭😭
I almost cried oh my god she can go out now!😭😭😭😭
She is a Lil cutie and a fighter
What an awesome story ❤
Omg thank you this video means a lot to me
It is so interesting to see how her body adapted to grow larger lungs and a smaller body to compensate the lack of oxygen ! Also she is so cute
I hope she can do it I know she can do it she's just so cute I believe in her
I am literally crying right now
The power of love. For animals and humans that are not soul-voided, it is the most powerful force YHWH our Creator has blessed us with.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Something needs to be done about breeders
She is absolutely adorable
This should have a billion likes and views
Thank you to whoever helped this little baby
love
dog breeders suck. THEY are the WORST breed.
She is precious
Incredible.
Soooo very precious, I cried the whole time I watched this, GOD BLESS YOU FOLKS FOR TAKING HER IN. SHE IS SO HAPPY!!!
I cried 😭 but ending was happy😊
God bless these people.
Love how they force her to do stuff she hates
So she wants to suffocate the dog?
Y is she so damn cute
Dumbass.. shes not blue
This actually teared me up a bit. The world needs more kindness like this.
Hi I wanted to now in 5 years if you would be hiring cuz I LOVE helping animals because they are Allah's creatures also cuz THEY DO NOT DESERVE IT
Casi me meto a la pantalla a abrazarla! Yo también sufría cuando le faltaba la respiración a este animalito perfecto ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She's so damn cute!!!!!
What breed is she?
This is my favorite The Dodo video. I love the journey of this little bubble girl.
She is so cute!! Love how she has Heterochromia.. such a beauty
It's so cute how she just waddles around and it's like she is trying to run fast but her legs just can't keep up.
Does anyone know what king of dog this is
Nobody:  Her to her stuffed animals: "WHY WON'T U PET MWA!?"
She's so precious 😭
Just so beautiful and amazing I love this

❤❤
Was she in a bubble? You never mentioned that.
This is by far the sweetest thing I've seen on YouTube. The amazing Sally 🥰
The moops, it says the MOOPS!
I cannot stop watching this heartwarming and beautiful video, even months later. God bless all the wonderful people who helped this puppy live a wonderful life
I really, really love that puppy because she's very beautiful and tiny ❤
I have brain issues and I’m only 15
I love her so much I want her to live forever😢🥹🥺☺️😗😗😚😚😚🥺🥺🥹🥹🥹❤❤💓💞💞💞
For the longest time I've been thinking that humans are on Earth for a purpose, and these people did that purpose perfectly.
Of course pup came from a breeder 🙄
TINY PUPPY TOO TINY
Looked like pochita from the thumbnail.
I'm 106 years old and this is my comfort food
tears falling brooo
What is she, some kind of astronaut?  No, she's some kind of bubble girl! AND SHE'S GOT IMMUNITIES!
I feel so bad for the dog what happened😘😍😎😘😍😎?!
I was like Sally. As a child I was six months in hospital in halo traction, flat on my back and completely dependent on the medical community. It makes you very grateful for love and connection. Sadly, I was denied those until I was an adult. My family hates people with disabilities, they think we should be euthanized.
Bubble girl ❤😊
The first half of this gave me mad anxiety
❤❤❤
She is such a fighter. Absolutely adorable ❤❤❤❤
Can I have her
This literally melted my heart ❤
You can't rescue a 2 year old or older dog, because you can't teach a old dog new tricks or guidance and because they were abandoned is for that reason there's nothing worse than a wild tame dumb dog, a nightmare until dead so 😊
She's cute
Anyone know what breed she is?
When she ran to get more oxygen that's when I started to tear up...😢 can't even enjoy living for the lack of oxygen
Was that a BIG ASS GREAT DANE with Pink toes at 2:49 ?  Sheesh..❤❤
Aww😢❤
I  Love   Salle  ❤
Beautiful story ❤❤❤
Omg so cute so brave❤
The puppy reminds me of Pochita
My heart just melted
Good girl
SHES SO SWEET <3 my god D:
<3
I love Sally!❤❤
You guys are amazing ❤❤❤.  Thank you
✝️🛐☮️💟
Odd, take all that time and not adopt her yourself?
This dog makes me want to try harder at life
and we would know that her true spirit will come out. sally: how to steal toilet paper and no one notices it .  me:  laughing so hard.  also i love ur video and sally was so cute when she was little but is still cute .
Amazing!!!
Çok tatlı maşallah
Beautiful doggo
So cute❤
Thanks for your love and dedication to saving this puppy’s life❤️‼️
😢😢😢😢😢
A miracle 😊🙏❤️
I can adopt her
Last night I had a dream about a dog who looked exactly like her and she almost drowned in water and I saved her and was caring for her.  I have never had a dream like that but when I saw her and saw she didn’t like the water I started crying so hard.   I’m not sure why the universe chose to show me this.   This video showed up in my recommended and she looks so cute and small like the dog in my dream.. just like her
ALL ABOUT PUPPY L❤VE!! Sooo Sweet: Angels Among Us!! Thanks bunches for saving her Life💛😇.  deb in DoggoVille, SC🐶  04/03/2023😊

AWWWW
Bless these little cuties
*Take a shot each time she says "bubble".*
I'm glad to see Sally is doing better!
I want a wife like the vet who saved her
That dog is sooo cute
I don't understand how some places like this are doing so much to save each dogs lives,  yet so many other places KILL literally HUNDREDS of dogs a month, and claim it's the best thing to do.  Make it makes sense...
This melts my heart ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Simply Wonderful, reminds me of Myself last time around.   😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
oh dear god (if exist) please let live!
Thank you. These stories make my day better!
You are amazing  how  awesome  such a beautiful  girl❤❤

Why did my mind immediately go to bubble guppies
Okay but the amount of tears I shed when they BUILT her a bigger bubble??? One that they could actually be inside of with her and cuddle her??? My heart just… so overwhelmed
You kind of unzipped it when you litterly opened the whole thing 1:56
Love conquers all ❤ such amazing humans and such a brave lil pup
What the breed?
Omg I cant
What kind of dog is Sally?  BTW, she is a beautiful puppy!!!!
You guys are amazing!
every time i watch this video i cry
im always on oxygen
She super cute that is all.
My heart dropped when they talked about adoption😭
🐾🐾❤️🐾🐾
Terimakasih!!! ❤️
This is like a story straight from Heaven.😭
So grateful for the people taking care of her, so much patience and kindness shown. I wish every animal was shown this type of love 💕💕
"In a Whole New Wooorld!~"
That looks like pochita
She's so cute I'm so glad she made it n has a wonderful family n life God bless ❤😊
Phenomenal job by the initial vet nurse/tech who supported Sally through until her adoption!
When she was a baby she was so cute 😍😘
“She’ll start slowing down when she gets tired” Well isn’t that obvious?
What an amazing story. Love this little angel. Glad she has a wonderful life now. Strong spirit. She should've been named pocahantos.
bro hit that dog zaza
AWWE SHES SO ADORABLE 😭😭😭😭😭
Aww
The dog an the toilet paper. Who will win?  The dog blasts at the paper! And the paper rolls up! The dog has won!!
🙏💕🙏💕🙏💕🙏
Tão pequena e precisa de tantos cuidados 😢o importante é que esse anjinho é feliz e amada ❤️obrigada pelo carinho e dedicação a esse anjinho ✨✨✨
What a smart puppy! She knew to go back where she could breath. She's amazing! You are amazing!!!!! Thank you for taking such good care of her.
WHY IS SHE SO CUTE HEEELP ❤️
She’s so adorable, I’m so happy that she’s okay and healthy now☺️
All I can say is, thank god for people like you.
Luar biasa cara Anda melakukan penyelamatan, perawatan,saya suka dan ini menjadi motivasi bagi saya sendiri sebagai pecinta hewan,saya senang membantu kucing terlantar dijalanan.bolehkah kami mendapatkan subtitle Indonesia 🤝🇮🇩❤️animals
This is an incredible approach at rehabilitating a puppy that very few else thought that she even had a chance. ❤
So cute!
if only people would gove above and beyond to save humans in the womb
Im so glad she was able to recover from such a miserable situation and how she was loved and strong it made my heart melt and make me think of how I had Nero Blastoma and I was age 4 and was in the hospital till I was 6 and it has been 4 years I'm so thankful for the life God let me live and how the puppy was able to survive.
I'm something of a respiratory therapist myself.
It’s enough to make a grown man cry
This was an amazing video!! Thank you
I love this
Another example of selfishness of breeders. Breeders are nothing but people using their pet's reproductive ability get quick bucks. They don't care about the mama's sufferings, they don't care about the number of animals waiting for a home in the shelters. All they care about it money. It's better to beg in the streets for money than do this. Please choose to adopt.
❤❤❤
This is so heart warming!❤
Thank God for the little puppy's health!
Beautiful inspiring story!
This baby is so precious 🥰. These videos are healing the world. Thanks for sharing ❤.
She is the most cutest puppy i have ever seen may god bless her😊
One of our dogs had that big lambchop toy LOL she is a miniature pinscher weiner dog mix within a couple weeks that toy was about shredded
May I now what breed se is I like the look and love that his breed gifs so can I now what it’s called?
You have done the work of millions of pet lovers like me thank you
Sally is beautiful
I want a puppy now
Sally’s living her best life.  😀
Kathryn, thank you for fostering and nursing Sally. Bonnie, thank you for adopting her. Was she born with underdeveloped lungs? She’s so sweet, adorable, smart, and fun.
May you always be blessed you and your family because you took care of this poor little baby through all of her sickness that is a wonderful story I love videos like this keep them coming and God bless you for taking care of her
Truly precious ❤
So she was so bad that antibiotics wouldn't have worked?
Sally is illegally loveable!@
God love her & those who stick with her along her journey. I hope breeders stop in-breeding; as the animals are always the ones who suffer.❤
That’s just awesome
Beautiful 😍
What a cutie
Dog breeders are scumbags!!
🤍
So adorable
I love her name just like my grandmas I miss my gramma😢
She's so precious ❤
They did the same thing with the man in the iron lung
The cutest puppy I have ever seen
Oooh my god she is so cute 🥰
That’s the sweetest face.
Oh I wish all animals were so loved
is she a dachshund ❤
The cutest puppy I've ever seen.
I can’t love Regis enough!  ❤
Looks like a baby dachshund. Looks just like my girl when she was a baby 🥹🥹  Omgosh she is a dachshund..she's so beautiful 😍
People complain about global warming but throw money and resources at nature making it unorganic. This puppy wasn't meant to survive but we have strays everywhere in the streets that need much more of this attention
i am very much crying.
This is too cute 🥰 ❤️☺️🐶🐾
She's so adorable ; ;  She's so lucky having you all look out for her :3 Thankyou for sharing this wonderful story!
its so cool wait even more sadder the cool 😎part is she knew when she needed to go back 😎😱😢
What a precious sweetheart!! So thankful for the many hands that gave her a chance ❤
Like Pochita
The lil tail omg😮❤
Adorable 🥰
😮😢
is that ironmouse
The dog is super cute
Good hooman
She is the cutest puppy ever
I didn’t even know she was a dachshund at the start!
God loves 💕 you, and so do I love 💕 you!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
So cute😊
what breed is this?
My god, she is precious. She is lucky to have such a dedicated human.
Oh sweet baby !
I'm a grown man and I couldn't help but tear up as I repeatedly call her "a sweet little baby" watching this video
Lil ol lady❤🎉❤😂🙏🏽🐕🐕‍🦺 Ty 4 such amazing care 4 this adorable fur baby!
Geico saves the puppies.
What was she born with that she could not breathe ?? What an amazing job you all did to give this cute girl a 2nd, 3rd, etc. chance at life !! Great story  !!
She is literally so cute❤
That is the most cutest puppy i have ever seen
She's too cute my heart melts 😍 😢
Sally’s a wewe
Every life is precious!!
It's like how people who live at high elevation have stronger lungs and more red blood cells than people at sea level. When people at sea level want to improve their lung function they reduce oxygen through elevation masks. Making her live in higher oxygen was comfortable but it just made her lungs weaker... making her struggle is what have her true healing. Bodies built by God to adapt and overcome obstacles
MUST NUZZLE PUPPY ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
She’s so cute ☺️
im a 35 year old man and i cryed and loved this ....
My little bubble baby!❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
2:49  The other dogs nails 💀💀

Lil sweetheart 😍
Aww, jeez, God bless these vets and techs for saving this adorable baby girl. :)
AMENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNÑNNNMNAA
She is sooo cute . ...!
I held back the tears almost to the end because I really thought Sally’s story was going to have a completely different ending.  I’m so happy that she is living a wonderful life.  God bless all of you who work so hard and devote your life to such a beautiful cause.  I’m still choked up thinking of how sweet and happy little Sally’s life is because of you.
Adorable
This is love at its finest! Bless y'all! 💕💕💕💕💕
Miracle Sally. She's beautiful.
Adorable.
she looks like pochitaa in real 😍 😍
to all those who thought there are no more good people in the world
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Does anyone know what breed Sally is?
Awh even her kids are gentle. Beautiful 🥰
I love love love people like you. You're doing a great service and we appreciate you (so does lil kitty) you gave her a new life!!
Thank you all that helped this little girl.
Sally you touch my heartstrings!!!  💕💕  God bless you precious little one.    Thank you Dodo for sharing such a good heartfelt story.
👏👏👏👏👏❤
Her going outside for the first time is like watching my family with allergies go outside.  "Wow, it's amazing out here!! :D"  (a few minutes later)  "Wait I cant breathe"
There wasn’t any other treatment for pneumonia?  Lasix?  Antibiotics?  Breathing treatments?
People like this woman are truly amazing 🙏
Ayo what's that outside? Damn there's stuff out here? Why's existence out here painful?
Idky but I thought she looked like Pochita a bit
Im crying, the woman truly is her hero and mama, smart little girl learning and telling them when she needed to go back into the bubble
everytime i see this video, i cry. so happy she’s doing good
Bless you for taking the time to help this precious puppy.
The puppy is a warrior Fight everyday with her lungs problem Go better and stronger
Go Sally Go! Your such a smart sweet girl! You are a lucky pup to have a forever home with  people who will absolutely love and care for you! Thank you to all the people who had love and patience to save this incredible pup!
I want her…
You are an Angel on earth 🙏🏻
I thank the Powers of Be for pet owners and caretakers like you❤️❤️❤️
Quiero felicitarla por lo que hizo con esa inocente. Tal vez en manos de otra persona la hubieran dejado morir. Bless you
If you ever had asthma, this video hits differently.
This dog is now my biggest role model o7
Poor baby💞💞💞💞
And they all lived happily ever after.
I’m glad her respiratory system improved and she got to live her days happily & that she had people that cared and helped her
wow
Precious
Omg, this is probably one of the best The Dodo stories I’ve watched. It enveloped what the channel is truly about ….. faith in animals, especially when they most need us, and to the goodness of people who love and never give up on them, can definitely restore hope and life. Just as this wonderful lady and family had provided to little Sally. They literally brought her back to life, and a good life, for that matter. The ingenuity of the vet staff in creating Sally’s bubble world is something to be commended as well. What a great group of people! 💕🐾
You are all angels for sure
This dog is officially the most precious thing I have ever seen <3
God bless you God bless you I love this little girl
I would love this little baby to death she's such a beautiful little angel
God I feel so bad for this little angel
The individuals and organizations that care for these animals are amazing people.
Thank God someone had the patience to see this through and now a little girly pup can live a beautiful life.
I am happy that little one is having fun and happy i wish that she will be okay soon ◉‿◉▼・ᴥ・▼
This is the cutest/sweetest video! I’m so glad that sally is living her best life now. Thank you both for helping her become a healthy and happy pup.
Bless these vets for saving that little life and making its time in the bubble as comfortable as possible, thank you. Was hard to watch the pup having to be in the bubble for so long, had me tearing up. It ended up with the perfect family though and will have a great life. Love a story where everyone wins 😊
Thank you for saving this little wonderful creature.People like you make this earth a beautiful place.
So cute
I love you bubble puppy
She’s adorable!❤😊
does anyone know what dog breed sally is
the sun and the grass helped her reconnect with earth and nature, plus the sun Boosted her healing to restore her to full health
Please can anyone tell me which breed is this puppy
Poor doggy
LET MEH KIDNAP😡😡😡
I've watched this 3 times now I am in love with her. How could you not. She's right she's just an angel. 💜
What a sweetheart! Who wouldn’t want to adopt her????
Oh man I truly love this channel even though it always brings tears to my eyes. Speaking of stuffed toys, my 120lbs wolf hybrid found small pink unicorn on the street & brought it home. After I cleaned it up he gave up his bed, wouldn't let anyone near it & cried to have it come with us on walks. You would not believe how gentle he was carrying it around. I'm sure he'd be a great father someday but I hesitate breeding him as most people truly have no idea how to raise a wolf; they are not just big dogs. FWIW Videos of Aayin on my channel from age 6 weeks & up. Take care all you animal lovers, truly the best people IMO.
she has such a pretty puppy face… my heart is melting 😭
So beautiful! What a hero she is, such a fighter and beauty this little dog is! ...So wonderful, inspiring and hope giving that there is humans in this world that care so much and really gives it all for other beings  🙇‍♂🙏💖😻☺
❤️❤️❤️what an incredible story. Amazing rescuing by the vet technician and I'm so very happy she found a beautiful furever family,🙏🥰💕 Is she an English Cream Dachshund ..?
SO PRECIOUS! You are angels for taking so much time with sweet Sally!
There are Some good  kind people  about, lovely puppy as well 😊
What breed is Sally?
OMG   look at that little tail wagging  ❤❤
So cute 🥰 !!!
❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤
❤❤❤
She got a last chance to a normal life thanks to you ...
Thank you! Humans like you are one of the most important creatures in this planet. You always making a way to give respect and importance to all kinds of lives. 🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤
A fantastic feel good story in a world that has forgotten about the simple and happy things. Pups are Man/woman best friend 🤗
I would have kept her if I were you. She’s a sweetheart. I dunno how could u give her
Humaning done right.
This lady is so pretty !  Nice story!
Wee soul😊😊😊😊
She is so pretty... and what a smart baby.
Live television
Would it be possible to make a stuffed teddy, with a temp regulated pouch of milk, that has a timer for pups and kittens like this one? If you steal my idea your inviting me to a European beach
Heroes!
Bubble Puppy' Decides She's Ready To Live In The World  makes 0 sense
She is the cutest little baby l have ever seen. Adorable 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 So glad she is ok. God bless the caring people.
6:05  O my is that a nasty flea on her left hand side of head ???
Why nurse the puppy like this and not commit to keeping her?   The hard part is already over. Why stress her with a complete lifestyle change?  If I help any living creature like this, they are welcome to stay with me for as long as they want to.  Breaks my heart to “give up for adoption”.
This dog gets better treatment than the sick people..
Very well done beautiful puppy
Wish more girls get that name  - Bonnie (-: every Bonnie I have met are hard working, built tough and common sense hearts.
She is so cute 🥰
Chi's are very smart. THEY may be the smallest dog in the world, but there personality is great Dane. !!! Oh I love chihuahuas !!!
some anime character training arc right there fr
Pobrecito perro
How are you doing now Sally?
Can i have her
Yall take more care of pets than your own close ppl WTF bro
She was much better than me as a kid. I’d run around and have an asthma attack and refuse my inhaler until I was forced to my nebulizer.
🥰Bless the efforts of these kind people ^_^ Wishing the best for ya Sally!
WHAT A BEATTY CLOTHING OMG😍😍💯💯
A wonderful story with good people and a cute little pup who fought for her life -- I'm so glad I got to see this.
I bet she was born with pneumonia.
So cute
She is so cute I’m glad that we have people out here there that helps animals
She is so brave she has the biggest heart and the strongest little puppy I've ever seen. she wouldn't stop trying to get outta that  bubble. tiny as she was she over came every obstacle shes a little miracle and shes so lovely.❤
she is sooo cute omg
The best and sweetest story ever this is to good to be true.
Is it a condition that got cured over time ?
I WANT HER
My favourite video!
Yayyyy bubble puppyyyy
When your more inspired by an animal than most people.
pure love
AWHHH I WANT HER SO BADDDD
Sweetheart ❤🙏🥰😍
It's amazing seeing dogs fighting and wanting to live best life with little they can do but slowly being able to live the life they wanted
This little girl is a modern day astronaut dog living on the space station,instead of going on a spacewalk she would go to the backyard until her suit ran out of air.
1:50 she has the same alligator dog toy as my dog! I’m nobody cares I just thought it was cool lol
I love her so much 😭😭😭😭
Sally is one of the biggest fighters I have ever seen, so small but a warrior since the beginning. Amazing story and I hope that Sally is still doing good
What an adorable puppy.  Thank you for all the work you put in to bring her to this lively little bundle of joy 💖
She’s so fckin cuteee!!!!! 😭😭
I’m seriosly crying like i feel so bad for that dog😢. But she was getting a very kind and and beautiful family😊
I would have totally named this cutie "Mudskipper" or "kipper" for short. Basically a fish that finally learned to be on land. 💕💕
They're forcing the dog to stay alive while making it "play" outside, gasping for breath outside. Truly disturbing.
So sad❤ she is so cute❤
Ever need to smile go to Dodo
bubble puppy? where have i heard that name before?
Love this. You ladies are awesome ❤
Bubble Puppy was the name of a rock band back in the sixties, early seventies. They had a big hit called Hot Smoke And Sassafras,FYI. What an amazingly cute puppy!
POCHIDOG!
She’s ADORABLE ❤
Ahhhh…..❤
This is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen 😊
Sally is just so adorable, and she’s a big fighter! I’m glad you took care of her, I can’t imagine i how it would of been like if she didn’t get the oxygen, I have a sick elder dog of my own and he had a hard time breathing, he kept gasping a lot and we got worried.
She knows her limits and those MUST be respected, ESP with this little angel.
Refreshing video 😄
These Dodo videos helped out from my anxiety borderline depression. These are some amazing souls!  Thank you for everything you do.
She was such a cute puppy! What happened 😂
why not take her to a Vet ?
What is that thing going from her back to her nose
Ok but I’d love to be that tiny and able to sleep in that bubble. It looks so comfy! Also it’s great to have this because if there’s other animals that are so dependent on oxygen they can have something already in place.
what a heartwarming video 🥺🧡🧡🧡🧡
😭😭😭😭😭 so wholesome
I can’t find the proper way to express how much I love this! Beautiful care beyond words.
Not me in tears the whole time watching this 🥺😭🤍
I will never give up on any animal that is trying there best to stay alive. If a vet says they wont make it, to me thats just them saying that they don’t want to take care of it.
Yes! Never give up ! I love this story!
🥺
Pochita..?
love on her? Ayo
Thank you for sharing this story, just precious :)
Sally is a fighter! ❤️
What a little darling. Thanks so much for your perseverance. It was so good to see her in the water.
That is one strong puppy! I don’t think I’ve ever seen a story like this before!
I love this story.  You are all such amazing people.
Amoreee😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍è la cosa più carina del mondo 😍😍😍😍😍🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎
That would be funny if they made a show called ‘Bubble puppys’
That is one of the cutest puppies I’ve ever seen! What angels you guys r to do this for her!
How did they bathe her?
Oof my heart. She's so cute I really wanna cry
What a beautiful story. I want to hug her so bad 💞
I love fake stories.
Poor little girl
Pochita, is that you?
<3
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Pochita
Ugly criedddddd
In a cold uncaring universe most animals would have simply just been put down. This one however is extremely fortunate. And thankfully this one will be given a chance at life.
aww
That beautiful and sad lovely girl rip
Everytime I see "The dodo" on my home page  I know by the end of the video I'm going to end up looking like  😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
What kind of breed is it?
WHY IS SHE SO GOD DAMN CUTE!!??😭😭😭😭
I have four loving doggies, two of which have special needs, and I couldn't imagine life without them. All the love you put in, comes back ten fold. You guys are amazing!
She's adorable
I love this video because Sally was only a pup when she couldn't breathe it's just so heartbreaking to see that she was almost dead but let's just take a minute to say a big thank you to the lovely women that saved her live I was crying aswell
THIS IS THE MOST FREAKING ADORABLE AND SAD RHING IVE WVER FREAKING WATCHED IN ALL MY LIKE OF YOUTUBE
I hate breeders so much.
What’s in her nose?!
Omg times ♾️! My love and admiration for these people and this courageous pup is off the charts.  Impossible to put into words.
SHES SO CUTE OH MY GOD
Beautiful baby
What an absolutely beautiful story of a beautiful little puppy that had the will to live and never gave up. Thank you for never giving up on such a sweet baby
Wow what patients!!!😁
I couldn't work their I'd be crying my eyes out and I'm a man
pochita from chainsaw man
im so happy she is feeling better
Crying! These gals are heros!!
If opening bubble was deadly how are you touching here?
That’s a cutest pup I’ve seen in my life
Why not just kill it
That thumbnail though
very lucky doggo. This made my day better
I felt so much empathy for this little puppy. If you've never had pneumonia its hard to understand what that little creature was going through. I am so happy she was able to survive. What a great story.
I know this comment is not that appropriate for the setting and theme of the video but, I genuinely thought it was an irl version of Pochita from Chainsaw Man in the thumbnail. :I
Oh bless her little heart.
Glad to see there's still faith in humanity helping poor helpless animals like this little cutie.
Hqhahah it went for the toilet paper
Such a cute little dog why would God allow this little creature to suffer
que preciosa
Love it!
Soo cute
does she have heterochromia
Thanks 🙏
And people ask why I want to be a vet when I grow up.
5:44 she’s so cut the way she accidentally fell 🥹
I loved her. ♥ I hat a rat that died from a tumor in his lung, and he used to breathe like that. =(
Interesting how much that muzzle continued growing.
Pochita?
Thank God for people like you who care. You are amazing people. Thank you so much.
This video absolutely heals my heart. A really inspiring level of dedication from miss Sally, showing that life is absolutely worth living and worth fighting for no matter your circumstances. I love all these Dodo videos but this one just touched me in a special way
So cute!!! 🎉
what type of puppy is she? she is so sweet and ur amazin g
Thank god people like this exist in the world. Xxx
😁💕
❤❤❤
Lol turn the dog into a mcnugget or something, and get another

6:46  a dog playing with toilet paper? I thought cats do that
Thumbnail of the dog makes it look like its from Chainsaw man
She's soooo beautiful 😍😍😍😍
I’m an Amazon driver, and this starts playing on my AirPods and I swear y’all got me in tears over here😭😭
What a beautiful story! God bless everyone who made possible her recovery
This is the true meaning of coming out of you’re bubble!
Thank you so much
So very cool.
❤
I pray this dog lives many more happy and healthy years 🙏💜💜
SO CUTEEEE 😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🍼
what jackasses would dislike a dog rescue video

If you see this you know, that good humans still exist. It gives hope.  Thats what the energy of mortal man is therefore. To preserve life at all cost thab to bring destruction and death to the world and its planet.
Wow what a heartbreaking story of Sally and what a enormous will to live she had.  The meaning of life is very simple. Preserve life at all cost. Most important. Only living beings make a life worth living.
😢
That pup is so beautiful. This video stirred up so much emotions, life is precious and Good Humans decorate our world.

These people are heroes, life is so very precious, thank you for doing so much for this pup.
Dogs are love!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Breeders should be illegal
My baby boy suffocated in my arms cos vets wouldn't diagnose at the begin of the pandemic, he was a more a therapy dog then anything my rock for 17 years and so healthy, I hate vets for it and watching this was hard but its thebstart if my trust curve again i spose, seeing you guys do good! I miss my boy so much, 3 years in a month and 2 weeks, I still wake up screaming for hi, I've been diagnosed with ptsd that's how traumatised I am, this was very hard to watch, but I'm very happy for the pup that's a start.....😪
Pochita
that dog is a teddy bear
What kind of dog is that it’s sooo cute
This is just beautiful. Never stop growing Sally.
She wouldn't live today without these human intervention. Bless her and all of you 💜

THIS MADE MY DAY
If ever there was animal with a will to live, that little baby is it!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 gimme herrrrr
It's amazing how the world of animals and nature get along so well. In the future I hope that the community can keep this up for our animals. They have feelings to, and we need to take care of them so they can be happy as well as other people. Dogs, cats, fish, frog, rabbit, and whatever! The all have feelings just like human and they seem so special to our world, and I want to give a round of applause for this kind woman who took the time to care for a puppy who is trying to be able to breath fresh air! This world would be much better if we had peace but sometimes it's not like that. God is good and I hope we all can agree humans and animals can be great buds!  Greatest wishes, Blue  P.S. I know I might be going to simple on this but always remember this: 1:35  See you! :)

DUBB DUBB XOXOXOXX💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💜💜💜💜
Humans and animals are very adaptable
Doesn’t get any more adorable than that I hope she lives a long, happy life
She started to grow and looked like a weiner dog
She had the will to live and the best support that she could get and it made all the difference in her healing.
She’s absolutely precious ❤❤❤
pochita!
A bad girl?  Seems an odd thing to call a sickly puppy that you're caring for .. This is a beautiful testimony to share of a precious creature.  Until she got a little older didn't even know what breed she was. Thank you for sharing the beautiful story.  What a blessing for all involved.
Why are these animals so adorable? 😭🥰
God bless you both for being such an amazing people! What a cutie 💖
Well the little thingy is alive thanks to the kindness of its human overlords. :V
Oh my goodness she’s so cute and precious!
She's so fucking cute dude
sally is such a sweetheart and bless all the people who took care and are taking care of her
Smol doge😍
She's got an amazing family!
God bless all of you, thank you for not giving up on her she’s so precious 🥹❤️🙏🏽
Poor little girl. She was everything that most humans are not.  I was called the girl in the plastic bubble.  By some of my family, members. Sally is such a true by little hero.  I have alot of physical problems I am for one blind in one eye.  My  fault.  I looked at the equipse about 15 years ago.  On a very cloudy day, I was told by that it was ok to do this.
She's such a strong smart little puppy to be able to know the limits of her body and when to return back into her bubble she's amazing! Her determination to never give up and the vets for taking such good care of her and never giving up caused a miracle to happen 💗 made me cry
Always patient 😇
This is too cute 😭💗
This is such a heart felt story... Thank goodness there are people like you in this world. There needs to be ten times as many of you! Thank you for this video. I'm going through a very hard time and this video not only healed my heart just a little bit, but made me have a little bit more faith in humanity!
Having lost a puppy who had trouble breathing. I was tearing up while watching this whole video, seeing that puppies with those issues can be healed and have a happy life like that, the thought of maybe being able to save the puppy that me and my family lost 9 months ago (she would have been 10 months old by now) is making me cry
I have not red Christmas blanket lol I use it for my dog Too!
This is so sweet... Running out of oxygen *isn't comfortable*. Holding your breath hurts! It isn't natural! But despite getting exhausted and winded from being outside of her bubble, she kept running out ;-; What a brave dog, a true inspiration ;-;
im so happy to see people fighting for puppies with disabilities. this is so wholesome. i wish everyone was like these people
You folks are angels on earth!
Love it
pochita
Sometimes you get a little faith back, this is one of those times
Beautiful
Great Video, thank you not using loud music.
no no no.
w dog
My name is bonnie
I might cry, thank you for taking care of this puppy it brings joy to my heart
How Beautiful!!!
🥺
How does it go to the bathroom?
The most wholesome development
Love ❤️ love ❤️ love, ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Very moving, very heartwarming. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Say "Like" again, y'know
So adorable, I'd spoil her every day
Awe isn't that something else! Awe she's just so sweet and adorable. How awesome it is that you picked up on her needs and made sure this precious little puppy was going to survive and get a chance at life. Amazing story..thanks for sharing and taking time out of your lives to take care of her. ❤
Similar situation to a person I know whose baby was born about 10 weeks early. they are now off the oxygen!
what dog breed is she?
who tf dislikes this video?
So much patience and determination in the people caring for this sweet girl. So attentive to her too, following the pup’s pace. And makes me so happy to see Sally be adopted by someone close to the foster parents, and she has a pack! What a sweet baby
If a dog does at first like water, introduce a dog that loves to play in water.....helps
Pochita?
thumbnail made me think it was pochita
Bless Sally’s little cute heart she is gonna live an awesome life!!! ❤❤❤❤
I love her❤
The earths energy wouldve been so good for her
OMG those ears🥰
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
When will I be ready? You will know when you're ready.
Bravest pup and best people.
love
She looks like the dog from chainsaw man! She so cute
Love cures all.
An awesome real life story.  Thank you for sharing.  Incredible. 🐕
She’s so freaking adorable that little trooper…
Y’all get a free pass to heaven! Peace and love
🥰
She's so very lucky to have been found by such wonderful humans❤❤❤
There is a God! Think you from the bottom of our hearts. She is so beautiful!. God bless you wonderful lady! And Think you for sharing your love with us. Walter and. Diane from Ohio ❤️
My God, just when you think they cant get any cuter. I am head over heels in love with that lil baby. I suffer from a lifetime of severe Asthma myself amongst other respiratory issues, so I know only too well what that poor baby had to go through. Im so relieved that at least she has managed to pull through and is now healthily and happily jumping about. God bless her and her caretakers.
This was such a beautiful story. You guys never gave up on her because she never gave up on herself. She knew as long as you guys were fighting for her. Then she was going to fight too. This makes me look at my two fighters in my home. My Autistic son and one of our fur babies from my son's dog. She had five puppies and by the time she was pushing out her last she was so tired. Me and my husband had to help. The last one was the biggest out of the litter. Unfortunately he wasn't breathing and I had to work fast. Cleaning out his nose and air way. Still he wasn't breathing and had to start doing CPR on the tiniest thing I ever had to. Giving him breaths and putting oxygen on next to him. It seemed like forever but I got him back. Yet the whole day was touch and go. Then he stopped breathing again at night and I had to work on him again. It was so scary and my Autistic son who was 24 at the time kept talking to him. Telling him "I we wont give up on you, Don't give up on us please!" I don't know what changed but he started to breath normally again. I kept an eye on him all night. By the next day he was eating and crying and moving around. Unfortunately they think the loss of oxygen might have caused some slower mental developments and his front leg has a deformity in the bone growth. You would never know he had anything wrong with him. It took time to catch up to his brothers and sister but he is amazing. He is the biggest out of all her litters and he is just a big puppy who just loves to play with toys and loves his mom and dad and his other two siblings from two different litters. I named him Journey because he had one heck of a journey to come into this world and stay in it. We just couldn't give him up and I'm glad we kept our special big little guy 😊
True angel thank you for not giving up on her 💓
I wish I had someone to share this little piece of happiness
This is so beautiful to watch … ❤
i feel bad for that young pup still developing her lungs i surprised that she finally finished developing at a kinda young age
The cutest little thing I’ve ever seen.
This dog is the solid proof of: doesn’t matter what’s your condition, doesn’t matter what the odds might be, YOU CAN DO IT! KEEP GOING!
💛💛💛
That's not nature that's years of selective breeding and science. Sometimes the results are not what you expected.
She's so clever and full of life <3
She is so cute! 🥰
I wish you could have tried a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.  Oxygen under pressure is a game changer!!!  Our vet has one and we've seen what they can do for humans too.  They are now being used in Israel as the standard of care for brain injured combat  veterans.
It’s amazing the love you showed that beautiful baby! I loved watching her tail wag. She’s beautiful and she’s happy.
SO CUTEEE
I keep this beautiful story of such a sweet dog beating the odds with the greatest love and care you all gave her ♥️ It lifts my spirits  ALWAYS 🙏🙏🙏🎉 Thank you and Bless you. I wish all the people putting up animal videos could watch your way of treating a puppy with delicate delicate health, and with attention to body and soul bring her back to a spectacular life🎉♥️⭐️
Every human should watch this and appreciate life..  We can learn so much from nonhumans..
This is a great story with a happy ending. Saved by good people. This Bubble Puppy made my day. Love her already. I am happy she got to live and enjoy life. Bless these people for their help.
Trash dog even trashier people. Why don't you help someone instead of on some little attention begging project. You can't breath your not meant to be here. Too bad the owners don't have the same problem.
U guys are so nice😍😍😍
My mom calls me her bubble to l because I'm allergic to everything lol
guys i think my eyes are broken, they wont stop crying
Jeez, I'm 63, a Yorkshire man, ex-miner and I cried.  😂  Well done and thanks for allowing her to live.
❤️❤️❤️❤️ 😍😍😍😍💋
So sweet. A lot of people would have given up on a pup like that that was completely dependent on oxygen. But that puppy persevered and got so strong and now seems so happy and healthy. Definitely a little but fierce dog.
Aww ❤️❤️❤️
So pretty. Love those jeans.💕💕💕💕
I hope you make more videos😊
THE GODDAMN PUPPY IS SO FREAKING ADORABLE
Thank you for caring for her 😍😍😍😊😊😊
Just simply amazing.
Prison for breeders
This is so sad
cute little weenie
I wouldn't be able to spend that much time and work on a puppy just to let someone else adopt her.
🥺💕💕💕
❤❤❤❤
When they put her in water. I'll bet she said to herself "I don't got to learn to breath this do i?"
Thank you!!! ❤❤❤
Oh my goodness, she is just the cutest little thing ever! She definitely found the perfect forever family for her to be with!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
She is absolutely adorable
What breed is sally?
Lots of love
I just want to cry. Sally is so cute. It is good that such kind people exist! She has such a good life after the air bubble!❤😩
this is why people shouldn't be allowed to breed dogs. Most people have no idea what they're doing. Then we have to put down thousands of animals every year because people think these animals are disposable or for making money
Aww she’s so cute and brave ❤
That dogs journey def didnt make me tear up or anything 😅
Insane levels of cuteness!
Best video I have watched so far this year.
Such a little Angel of a puppy!!
Am I the only one that lost a little respect for her when she allowed the dog to be adopted?
Thank you for loving and caring for the little pup-pup. She gets to enjoy her place in the world.
Thank you.
I wish my dog would know when he needed smth because I have to guess when he wants smth
She so cute
When she compared her finger to the dog i was like OMG ITS SO TINY TO BE SUFFERING and broke into tears
this is so cute I almost cried
😭😍💜
How did she go to the bathroom then 😳
How did she go to the bathroom
she’s so freaking cute
Thank you for the wonderful story.
That’s one darlin baby!  Thank you for saving her💜💜💜
OH MY GOSH, the way she immediately gets back up and wants back out, howling her heart out is just so pure, so adorable.
She’s so cute 🥰
I feel like I've never seen an animal with an NG tube! My daughter has one for 7 weeks as a baby, before she got her G-tube surgically placed. Amazing things they can do for both people and animals!
My heart is so happy. Thank you from he bottom of my heart. Stay well, beautiful baby.
Omg what a cutie!
😭 I knew she was a Dachsy!!! ❤they’re the best omg
She is somlucky !!!!
Unbelievable ! Thanks to your heat and the air buble ! How could you feed her in that chamber ?
Be careful raibes is contagious and painful make sure she has her shots
She is sooo cute and her eyes!! One blue one brown, Beautiful!! What a strong baby. She found a perfect family. Amazing!
Similar to me in elite dangerous. Difference is im afraid to leave the bubble!  👁👄👁🍿
Gosh she looks like pochita💜💜💜💜
Such a beautiful story
Real sweeties, the vet technician and the puppy!
WOW!!
Fantastic work!

Thank you to all the little Sallies out there.
Breeder 😓
Joy
My heart is there my tears flow as I watch
I'm balling your so good
Above and beyond  God bless you and yours
This had me crying... it's always so heartwarming to see good people out there
Sally and you got the best of both worlds when your coworker became her mom. Sally is a smart dog n I'm so glad you took the necessary time to bring her to good health n confidence. Thank you both for loving Sally.
So how come Bonney wasn't doing the hard work?
Humanity at its finest.
What's her breed?
Hey! Anyone know what breed this is?
I am so grateful this precious darling, Sally, was lovingly cared for and nurtured by a super loving person AND found a perfect home in a person that was right there by her side every step of the way. Bonnie & Kathryn are two truly beautiful people with some of the biggest hearts right here. Thank you so much for your amazing work and for pursuing such an amazing career (vet tech's I presume). I hope they see this message one day. ❤
0:46 She said that a bit aggressively lmao
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Can't wait for this to be adapted into a Disney film
People who love and work hard to take care of their pets are the very best people and show what love and kindness can do for our messed up world.  High five to all you people out there who love your pets. You make a difference.
Case
THESE PEOPLE ARE SO KIND AND CARING  TO THE PUPPY ❤❤❤❤
Im keeping her in my Prayers,she’s  way way WAY to adorable to struggle❤ My heart :(

It's so unfortunate that she was so ill at such a young age, but so happy that she survived with so much love  and care from these wonderful people <3   Hope she is living the best life ever with her new family <3
Usually I don’t comment on animal videos because I feel people overreact but I gotta say that dog at every stage of her life is fucking adorable

Thank y'all for helping Sally and sharing her story. God Bless!!
Shee looks like poochita😚
The little champion who would not go quietly into the night; who would not give up her fight.

My kitty has mild cerebellar hypoplasia, and his wobbles are so endearing. He’s a sweet clumsy boy, and even though he can’t jump high or run straight like other kitties, I love him so so much

Perseverance is always an incredible thing to see, especially when overcoming deadly conditions like pneumonia. Hope the dog is doing fantastic!
One lucky dog good to see people go the extra mile

Dogs are so amazing!! ❤️

Such a cute dog and a real fighter. I'm happy that she got better 😀
aww
Oh my goodness she is soooo sweet!!!!!  You all are amazing angels taking care of those poor babies!!!  God Bless you all !!!!!!
Sally confirmend being a Sigma Female. She decided one day to not need the oxygen chamber anymore ... and so she did. 💪
I am an asthma having animal over
that dog is so cute it’s different
That was my childhood living with adults that smoked cigarettes.
Pochita??
A breeder who probably makes 1000 plus on each puppy "couldn't afford to care for her", are you joking?  We need to put a stop to these breeders, it's all about money, and not about the dogs.  The shelters are OVER RUN with dogs and puppies, ADOPT, DON'T SHOP!
There was a 60s psychedelic band called Bubble Puppy.
It's awesome o know that there are still good people put there
Wow. The perseverance, consistency, dedication and love that these people showed towards this little puppy is absolutely heartwarming. What a great result. What great people. 🐕💙🐾
Sally! What an amazing family and community that she has supporting and loving her
Aw
breeders suck!  these  as e are living beings folks.  rescue all the needy pups out there
Same with aborted babies ,if truth be told . Save human children which are 100 thousand times worth more than any dog . I'm glade this cute pup made it-- good job.
I hope that this puppy can breathe longer outside somehow I love her🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍
God bless you all
I love your videos
The Lil bark just AAWWWWWW
Wow that's so inspiring
I didn't know things like this existed, its so cute its called a bubble too.
Adopt, don't buy --
Thank you so much to all the angels who save these fur babies ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you to these beautiful people. 🙏
Omgggggggg it’s soooo cuteeeeeeee
damn, the future vet bills..
There is a very special, warm little part of heaven for all those wonderful people who "care..."
What a precious little girl!
It is just not she surviving. It's about how an angel like you made her live the life she was intended to.
I wonder how her feeding and bathroom went for the bubble period. I'm happy she's well.
Breeder that's f****** disgusting. Why don't we do this to our human children? Oh wait we can't
So cute
She went from looking like a baby golden retriever to a dachsund.  Weird.
What a little cutie.

She's so smart 😭😭 the way she knew when she needed her bubble and how curious she is! What a smart little baby
Now this is loving humans.   Thank you. 💕
This is what happens when you have a good heart and put your Trust in God. It might not happen as quickly as people would like it but they won't give up as long as you have faith and don't give up on either of them.
I love how she was all like "Water. GROSS!" too cute
Such an adorable puppy ❤What a little fighter 💪 Thanks for helping her out 👏👍
Such an adorable mess!!!!!
Little cute.
I love this story
I'M IN LOVE WITH SALLY🙏💓💞😘😊❤️‍🔥THANK YOU PRETTY FUR BABY SALLY.....YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP.....🙏💓💞
That's part of the reason why dog/cat breeders shouldn't exist, they're leeches who profit on suffering.
Wait but. How dose she eat if you can not open the bubble??
This is *so* sweet! Shows you to never give up, no matter what.
I absolutely love this! Sally is such an amazing, strong, cute little soul. ❤️
That has to be one of the saddest things I ever heard
In the start of the vid, she was breathing like how one of my dogs puppies was breathing when she died. I wish we had an oxygen bubble.
Thank you. Made me cuddle my little babies. I am so happy grateful for your kindness. Beautiful people. X
I love animals and u guys and I love the bog
Oh my gosh she's just so cute💖🥺🥲
ever since i met dogs i hated people who don't accept animals in the house
Sally is so adorable and so very precious.
Whoa amazing love and caring of her. Thanks there are loving person out there
Breeders are scum. Only interested in the animal when it can make them money. They should be paying all her medical bills!
I don't like clothes on animals.
He is the cutes bog
THANK YOU!!!
What a wonderful human being to do all of this….
❤❤❤❤
God bless ❤️
She is so cuite i love her i love dogs
Best story I seen today!

Beautiful story

It’s amazing how as a dachsund, she didn’t grow up, she *lengthened*
You guys are special people👍
She made a deadly risk to not spend enough on oxygen points in the spawnmenu 💀
She looks like she’s gonna evaporate at any moment💀
You people Are they example of angels human angels thank you for being so nice to animals all animals they are the best but we can also be the best as your show in this video happy new year for all the animals in your house of course you are included because we are all animals

K preciosidad parece un patito mareado

Thank you people for the warm hearts! Gives me some hope for humanity! Best of all for you!
4:42 Maybe she liked the grass because that's where the oxygen was coming from
❤️❤️❤️
You are a hero!!
I really hoped her name was bubble until I realized it was sally
Your amazing thank you for service to humanity. You make the world a better place.
Thanks to the foster mom who took the time, money and ingenuity to create and maintain the necessary equipment, hygiene, and feeding for that little fur bundle!
I was crying
What a little fighter. Instantly fell in love with Sally. She's adorable. Thanks to those that cared for her and helped her to heal and live a happy life.
dedication is beautiful
😭😭😭
So happy her life likewise god and you hard work My dear friend.
The dog is all better and got adopted. Yay!
So far so good
I wish you good luck pup
How sweet is she !!!!!!!!!!!! and cute
Blessings to all the people that help this little one, God will reward you in many ways.
Wonderful!  Happy 2023 to you to!
She is Precious. Bravo nice work. kindness is a weakness to the indecent but virtuous to the decent. Thank god we have plenty of decent humans in our world.
She's so cute
Sometimes things happen in life they might be bad things but it all happens for a reason and this story is a great example of that and how that puppy couldn have a puppy hood, could breath without a bubble with out oxygen, and she was stuck in the bubble and probably wanting to play but she actually seemed very happy and loved life  ❤️and tryed living it as best as she could ❤️ shes a fighter she just wouldnt give this just shows never give up live life to the best you can like that bubble puppy ❤️ , always remember that thing's happen for a reason ❤️
Thank you so so much for giving her a chance at life
I'm seeing this on the last day of 2022.....I'm so happy.
That is so sweet I love that dog
Anytime I'm feeling down I watch a dodo video. Restores my faith in people.
Breeder 🤬
shes an angellll 💕💕💕💕💕💕
She’s a survivor 😎
She's such a cutie pie!!!!!
So cute 💕🥰💕🥰
I ❤your dog and can we appreciate how you saved her life she is so adorable and you are so kind I love how you thought of her. Think of how kind you are too kind you’re like a superhero!
Thank you for taking such good care of her and nursing her back to health. She is so happy to be a puppy and enjoy life. It's a beautiful sight and made tears stream down my face.
What a cute little girl, thank you for such an amazing job
That is so amazing and she is so cute ❤❤❤ keep making videos!!❤❤❤❤❤
She is so cute 🥺
The thought of a puppy that young having to go without snuggling up to a real warm body with a heartbeat for so so long breaks my friggin heart
Poochita
Just viewing this now on 12/29/22.  I am a semi-retired human doc who is an animal-lover but not a pet owner now.  The strides of veterinary medicine are incredible.  I guess that Sally got her food/water initially through her NG tube before she could eat and drink on her own.  It reminds me of the human advances for preemie neonates.  We can now save humans and animals who would have perished in the past.  BRAVO!
What an amazing dog that Sally is. And blessed all the people who cared for her and showed her with love.
Oh my goddess!! I LOVE HER ❤
😢😮
Real life pochita
The girl talking in this video loves gang banging music the promotes drugs and violence and she loves the song wap. Lmao facts
Who would torture a dog like this ? Probably someone that paints there dogs toenails pink for there own self gratification and don’t say it’s for the dog the dog has no idea what pink toenails are. Obviously you guys are dog people for yourselves and for making money. Would the dodo exist without social media is the question
I love dogs with all my heart but you should have just put the dog down..
the fact that people waste thousands of dollars on a fucking animal when there is so many starving and poor people out there just blows my mind and its disgusting
Omg put her in a xmas stocking she way to cute
1:36 ooooohhhhhhhhh the little teethies! First teenie little baby teeth
💟💕❤🧡💛💚
A compliment to our species these people.
I'm so happy
Beautiful story.. 💯💪
Is she a dachshund?
Chase had to live in a huge ocean theme tank as a merpup
it was heart breaking at first  but at the end it was so wholesome to see a puppy that was struggling get so much better and see the world again :)
What kind of dog is she???? I want one!!
Thank you for saving this dog! But can we also just talk about how the title reminds me of the old show “Bubble guppies”
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Her outfit is so cute lol she’s a fighter in fashion
The music is so annoying.  It was hard to hear you talk and I really wanted to k ow what you were saying.
feeling so proud
Most of these cases are result of irresponsible breeding. It's a good thing that there are so many people who are willing to help and they sacrifice so much to do so; but there should be stricter rules and harsher fines for reckless breeders.
At 4:46 my aunt dog was that size when my aunt got here dog
Can we just all appreciate how great that lady who works at the store is, She made sally feel special from the moment she walked in and showed her loads of love and affection
My heart goes out to Sally for being so strong, such a fighter 💞
These people are truly angels
pochita
It feels more than wonderful to have good people in the world who care and give care. Thank you  😌🙏🏼❤️
This was so wonderful to watch. Adorable to bits. Thank you for such dedication and patience. She truly is a gorgeous little doggie.
Thank God they took the time to save her. Other people would have given up but now she is living her life in love.
I feel so good for the puppy how it wanted to come out every day to try new things
:)
May we all take inspiration from these two amazing people ❤️
If she can do this I can get back into excersize and healthy eating.
These women deserve so much love for the work they put into taking care of this dog. Very few people have the love and patient these women showed here. Im baffled and happy for such wonderful human beings. God bless their families and their hearts!
I would never be able to do a job like this simply because it would be so painful for me to eventually let them go and get adopted. So sad that those who care the most about animals are also the ones that have to see them go the most as well.
This dog is legit the cuetest fucking thing I’ve ever seen in my whole life. No exaggeration
That IS a great thing. Congrats for ALL the hard work.
We had a pup who had this, sadly we didn't have the budget or money to save him. I tear up now knowing what our pup suffered, if I knew what I know now what he had we would've taken him to the vet to be put down, poor thing :C
What breed is she?
I've watched at least 500 of these n this by far is my fav!! Beautiful puppy n story ty
Sally is so cute! I’m glad she made a full recovery! 😊
Awe! Thank you dodo for this beautiful video. :*( what a remarkable pup.
us on mars
In the bubble: "She's a little angel." After the bubble: "Sally no! Noooooo!! Sally no!"
She is soooo cute 😍 💓
These people that took the time to help her are beyond Amazing the dedication and resources needed is astonishing that puppy is so beautiful just wow wish all humans would put this much effort into loving and helping.
I feel like I'm doing this right now! But instead of my lungs, I'm building my social skills. I'll take some inspiration from this pup.
That is the cutest animal on the entire planet
I cried of her cutness
Precious Baby Girl!!  <3
The stripe on her head is so cute
It's a really cute and strong puppy <3
I love the fact that people care enough to take care of a little sweetheart like this!
That is one of the most cutest pups I've ever seen
Bless you all for persevering to give Sally the best life possible❤
Bellissimo!!!
She is so beautiful and precious!
This video actually made me decide to stop smoking 3 months ago (after 20 years). Haven't touched a sigarette since.
Bless her little heart!she is miracle and to have her lungs break then replenish is miracle
What kind of dog is she a teckel ?
If she was in the bubble all the time where would she do her Business
this is so freaking cute
Why did I read the “bubble” in the title as “buildable”? Have I been on Reddit for too long?
christ as big of a POS I am..... why cant I stop watching these dodo vids?!
She’s amazing
This is heart breaking😊😊
Wonderful!
what breed is this
"She was just an angel" second clip made me reeeeeee
ICU for puppies! I love it!
Wow she got a second chance at life . They lady cared for her like a human being. She grew up and looks like a normal healthy puppy dog.
What a brave little cutie ... heart melting 🥰
If she just needed oxygen, wouldn’t it make sense to give her a face mask or a little helmet?
This is the most touching story. It just shows you the will power. Also shows the love. I know on the surface it may look like she made it on her own. But the ultimate one that healed her lungs was her maker...God. He is our creator and ultimate healer. When people watch these videos. I hope it makes you want to get to know the hands, the savior who created you me and the animals we see. Everything was made by him. and it's he who does everything. I encourage everyone to watch this video. Please....Jesus loves you. And his love was not only shown through his dying on the cross for you. But also in the animals he created that love us. Ever stop to wonder where do these creatures get there personality from?  Ever stop to wonder, why they love sooo deeply...do the funny little things they do.....warm our hearts.....and provide the world with such love? Well, the answer is simple. God, who created us and them....built them with this nature. It's no accident. His love is shown not only in his sacrifice for us...but throughout the entire earth, heavens and seas which were all created by him and through him. Jesus Christ. I truly want to loving share this video for anyone who might stumble across this comment. The same creator who created the earth and the animals is coming again. A wonderful video message: "The Key To The Christian Life" - Charles Stanley.   "The Key To The Christian Life" - Charles Stanley.  Put it right here in the search and it should come right up. Guys, Jesus does love you....come to him....! God bless you all....and for taking the time out amidst all these comments to not only read this one...but also watch the video.
❤!
In the thumb nail she kinda looks like pochita from chainsaw man
😍
I love this!! Thank God for good people!! How I wish breeding would stop. I am so happy for this little one!!
Sweetest story about the sweetest pup! Glad she is doing better! If I ever get her type of breed I’m gonna call it bubble! ❤️
She so cute🥰
What dedication! Thank you for your efforts to keep this little fur puppy alive!!!
:0 That was SO RUDE. Who would take toilet paper. The dog must have needed to wipe
What breed is she?. Beautiful thanks.
So many times I see awful stories about abused dogs. It's so nice to see these stories about the truly wonderful people in the world who will do anything to help dogs in need. Sally is such a precious little girl and I'm so glad she had the strength to stay alive with the help of these excellent women. This is what humanity should be like everywhere. This is a true love story and one of the only reasons I still believe in us as a species. I have to tell myself that for every dog that gets abused there is a human waiting to love them. For every animal in need, there has to be someone who can help. If I don't tell myself that then I give up. I can't give up, so I'm always glad when I see proof that there is still real beauty in the world. This is perfect proof of real beauty. Thank you to these kind women for being so nice to Sally. I know she appreciates it. Thank you for sharing your story. Thank you for sharing her story. I'm so glad I watched this tonight.
Beautiful work. Well done.
I could not for the life of me, figure out what kind of dog she was when she was a tiny puppy. I thought maybe she was a King Charles Spaniel or something like that.  AND THEN all of a sudden she turns into a dachshund! Lol that was the absolute last dog I thought she was. Her snout just didn’t look like a dachshund’s when she was little. Still the cutest dog ever! 🐶
How utterly callous of the breeder, discarding a pup who wouldn't add to her profit margin.  All breeding if animals should be banned.  There are millions of animals in the world who need rescuing with too many pups and kittens along with adults being euthanized every day.  SHAME on you evil breeders who have no care for animals only about their profit. Disgusting!
She is so so so so so o so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so cute ❤❤❤ I love her
This is my favorite part 7:53
😊
Thank You for sharing this most wonderful story! ❤
She went from a baby that couldn't breathe to a big puppy that's healthy!♡😁😁😁
im crying this is so adorable
Pochita?!
THIS PUPPY IS SO PRECIOUS AHHHH
She’s amazing 🤩   Wonderful job!
I admire people with dedication in saving a life
Jerry: He's a bubble boy. George: A bubble boy? Jerry: Yes, a bubble boy. Susan: What's a bubble boy? Jerry: He lives in a bubble. George: Boy.
George: Ohhh no! I'm so sorry it's the Moops! The correct answer is the Moops!
This is the cutest thing I've seen all year. Hope the puppy is doing well!
Thank you so much 🥺🙏🏻😔❤️
Pense que era pochita
The whites of her eyes were bluish. Not a good sign. But I don’t know if that’s the same in puppies as with babies.
She's very cute but she should have gone to another family, this one already had 4 or 5 dogs
Humanity at its best.
Wow little Sally is a sweet precious little girl so adorable she's a sweet pea how can you not love her" and give her all the hugs and smooches all day long she's a miracle princess, thank you loving kind caring Christian wonderful family, you' all are true angel's lm so happy" that' Sally have you' all in her precious life, happy holidays to you family and little sweet pea bless' you' 🐕👣👣🦴🏘️☃️❄️🙏👼🎀🎁🎇🎄🍷🍹🍾🍺🥂🍸🥃🧉🥧🍰🍬🍬🍭🍗🍖🍞🥐🫕🍠🥔🥬🥒🦞🥗🌽
My daughter used to be on a ventilator she started to pull it off and cry when it was put back on....the doctors said she would never come off .......21 years later, no vent❤️❤️❤️❤️So happy for this pup, sometimes they know before we do❤️❤️❤️Best wishes and happy life for you all!!!!!!
5:54 what’s up with people and petting dogs so roughly? Like I’m not a Karen but I don’t think petting them so hard to where their eyes get pushed up like that can feel good 😂
💪💪💪
What kind of puppy is she
🔆🔆❤️❤️❤️
If we treated each other half as well as people treat pets we wouldn't be in this mess
I know bubble puppy from bubble guppies
Anytime now her breed?  She’s so precious!
Everytime I watch a dodo video. I think I've seen the cutest pup, I've ever seen. And then I watch another dodo video...🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕gotta love the pupps

NOT ME BAWLING MY EYES OUT
It’s giving “Nah air? Never heard of her. IMA BE FREE”
Such a cutie :-)
This dog wasn’t meant to survive by nature. Humans need to stop messing around with nature
you mane air
Thanks for sharing absolutely beautiful
I  know I'm late but start a LONG LIVE THE BUBBLE CHAIN
Such a sweetheart ❤❤❤
good job
Thanks
You’re on the target Goodmorning :0
This made my whole life  😭
♥🐕
How were you able to feed her when she was a baby if even just unzipping the chamber had her gasping for air?!
Cute!! She stayed in her bubble as if acting like a child understanding it well
i'm in tears
so sad, halfway in i had to skip forward.
❤❤❤
Thank you for not giving up on her 🥹🥹🥹
Her determination to live!  She is adorable 💋😘💋😘
It's an amazing exceptional story! 💓🐾🐾💞 What a wonderful woman who cared for the tiny puppy 💝🤗as well the family who adopted this beautiful lovely sweetheart💖💖 Blessings 💟🌹🌞
I really hope that all these people who love animals don't eat them.
why does this actually go kinda hard tho...??
Im the 205k like
She looks like Max from the original grinch movie! <3
How absolutely beautiful. Does my heart good to see such beautiful people being so kind, considerate, loving and caring. Thank you, and God bless you all.
I absolutely love this story 💖🥲
What a lovely story…. ❤️
all right, my hope in humanity has been restored
Kudos to the breeder who gave the dog a fighting shot. Most breeders would’ve killed the dog
God bless you 🙏 ❤️
This video makes breathing more difficult.
♥♥♥
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She's so tiny but tiny dogs are the boss of all dogs
Well, I don't usually just break down watching, guys, but what a challenge to keep this beautiful baby safe and help her get out into the world.  I hope she continues to thrive.  Thank you for working so hard for her.  <3
What incredible people to do this for this precious little being, thank you !!!!!!❤
vets need to neuter any animal born with defects like this, to help spare the next generation from this suffering
Wow the swimming at the end made me cheesy grin. What an awesome video full of awesome people! (and animals of course!) You all did her proud! :)
Thank you for your love and your humanity 💙
💖💖💖
All of you guys are freakin hero's. Love you all. Sally was so lucky to have all of you.
❤❤❤❤
She's so beautifully precious!!  I love her!! 😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋💋💋💋
That Vet Tech is kinda Hot just sayin! LOL
Hey, that not a dog, that pochita
I'm watching this in the perfect timing, as I am struggling with perseverance and motivation. Sally and Kathryn are a huge inspiration, the patience Kathryn had in the whole process, and the perceverance Sally had even though she was having a terrible time breathing. Her motivation to live and explore the world, it's just amazing. I cried like a baby the whole video, thanks so much for sharing.
Das haben Sie sehr gut gemacht ! Ich sende eine virtuelle Umarmung  !
Om....her owner have ass for 5 normal womens. But have good heart
poor baby. She is adorable. I will pray she heal and survive.
poor baby
Hearts of gold, the lot of them!
From far away thumbnail looks like a real life Pochita from Chainsaw Man
Sitting here on a cold gloomy morning in Peoria Illinois and I come across this video!!!!! It warmed my soul!!! She’s the cutest! Thanks to all the people who helped her on her journey to recovery!!!!! I love her!!!!!!
Awesome people doing amazing things…you are miracles leading the way saving that dog’s life. This video gives me hope know there is decent people in the world. Thank you for the love you and your staff showed to this animal.
This is so sweet of them she's adorable! Most veterinary workers only care about the money and not actual animals. This is rare for vet workers to do if they're not getting paid for it.
the human angel and the dog angel
You all are amazing! thank you for being great people looking after these beautiful fur babies.
She deserves all the cuddles and hugs.  Thank you to the woman who took the time and effort to watch over this puppy and not give up on her.   She’s ready to take on the world :)   (May she always have room in her heart to continue loving the stuffed animals she slept with :p  as well!)
6:12 Just how casually she said Sally was an angel like "duh, period" got me burst into laughter😹 Can't thank these hard workers enough. Beautiful story!
She is so cute and I hope she is happy
Wonderful people and such a sweet dog!
Im crying fr fr
I hope that we get to hear more about Sally in the future!!!
I *HATE* breeders. Puppies don’t deserve to be born struggling. This little girl is so sweet and happy 🥰
Adorable
She officially won NNN
Go Sally!
Good job humans.
thanks God angels like these exist and this baby can have a beautiful life❤🙏🏻
Lol oxygen dependant
Pochita 😨
🙂 😇 such a sweet baby...makes me cry tears of joy to see her so happy and healthy
my heart..........
Wow, I came here expecting a Bubble Guppies reference.
She is soooooo cuuuuuuuuuteeeeeeee!
White people are amazing.
Hey! Don’t forget that Jesus Christ loves you and he died for you have a blessed day ❤❤
She was so smart and had such caring people!
Such a sweet dog and story
I haven't cried this much in a long time. Thank goodness there are good people like you and your family! Thank you!
🐶❤❤❤❤THANKYOU  FOR HELPING THIS LITTLE CREATURE !
God bless you both 🙏
I loved this video. Thank you so much for all you do. God bless you all.
What an incredible story. This dog became my inspiration!
Maybe next time wean animals off the oxygen by turning the percent down a little each day. 100%…98%…96%…
Seeing such a tiny baby struggle to breathe was so sad.
That is the cutest dog I've ever seen
I'm a preemie,  so this video is definitely a breath of fresh air!
You guys are the reason i didnt killed my self today. Thank u
You all are very Special & Rare People Every last one of y'all I just want to be Healed and have the finances To be able to do this and give donations to help God HELP!!!!!!!
I love her VERY MUCH!!! she's so precious such a strong fighter omg 😭 I just love her
Thank God for good people like you! 💕

Dogs are atleast in one way like potatoe chips..  You can't just have one

God bless you all!
Wonderful!
"Hot smoke & sassafras"
Omg I love you, God bless you for everything you do for the animals
I can only imagine the tears every time 😢😢😢
Aww
I think you're awful. Have you actually ever thought how TERRIFYING it is when you struggle for every breath? I have emphysema so I know and its evil. Leave nature alone, it knows best.
Strong girl
Such a sweet story ❤
I think my dogs look forward to me watching these videos.  They get extra attention afterwards.  I don’t know how anyone can’t smile with a dog in their life.
This is such an inspirational video. Sally's determination is so beautiful and I'm so grateful to these vet techs for caring for her.
🥰❤️🙏🏻🕊✌🏻🌎🌍🌏❤️🙏🏻✌🏻🇺🇦🇷🇺❤️🙏🏻🕊✌🏻👽🥰
what a strong weenie :]
She got to experience life, and be free thanks to you beautiful people that helped her. You are truly great, and this pup is so blessed!
😇💞💓💓💗
hope that breeder got charged with every cent it cost to make this puppy healthy.  breeders are scumbags that when an animal doesn't meet their requirements they just dump them.   glad these women took the puppy and gave her a happy ending though.
Sally,is,sooooooooo,remarkable
Sally is a fighter. At least she has someone that was being patient through out Sally's journey
There is good in the world.  What a little sweetheart.  💖💖
Spot 1
Waste of money
God bless you
I'm not crying, your crying.
🥰💕🥰💕🇨🇦
I will never love anything as much as this dog.
Precious baby thank goodness she found such a caring 💓 mom
Squeeeeee....she's a Dachshund 💖💖💖
❤What a precious little Angel! She’s so adorable and has the most adorable personality! So much ❤in such a little body! God Bless , sending much ❤ from Oregon!
They still need to bring that bubble, just in case
Sally stealing hearts out in the world 💞😍💋🌹🧿
Oh oh she is so wee... She looks like those little mall toy puppies that yip and bounce!
Bless her 🥺 go sally go!!
Beautiful story and so uplifting at such a harrowing time. Bless you guys.
So cute 😊
Epic
so precious
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
OMG! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for saving this baby!
I wish more animals could get this kind of treatment. Sadly most just get out down because of how expensive it is to treat them.  I couldn’t imagine the amount of money it would’ve taken if she was originally someone’s pet and they brought her in because she couldn’t breathe. She wouldn’t be here. Idk why they even have people learn how to treat these animals when they don’t make it affordable for 98% of per owners.
I forgot that I saw this before. And just like before I cried. I was born with a facial deformity that caused me to not be able to swallow formula. My maternal grandparents took me in. In my very early childhood my only friends were puppies and kittens.That is why I have a very tender spot for those little babies and people that were hungry and in need. Especially children even though I was never able to father children. I’m very thankful to have those feelings for others even though they may not realize it. I wish the world was more compassionate.
It's amazing how this kind lady took her in and raised her do patiently! Could someone please tell me what breed she is?
Why did I go into human medicine instead of this
The breeder couldn't take care of her or didn't want to?
This is a heart warning, story. Too bad ppl can't find this level of compassion for an " adopt a suffering HUMAN program.
Oh that puppy is crazy
This is 🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛
What a fighter, with the help and support of the vets.
That’s a cutie
You guys are f******g saints 😇😍
Omggg this is tooo cute for my eyes! CUTENESS OVERLOAD💀❤
❤❤❤
Your videos makes me cheer up :)
This was the most wholesome thing I have ever seen, just tearing up and crying the whole time
😍🤗
The sentiment is that this is one of the best stories!! These ladies are Sheros. Truly selfless act of kindness. And pup is a warrior!! Wow!  I have to add, irresponsible breeders.. please stop! So many rescues and shelters have dumped dogs from breeders.
What an amazing girl and such an example of perseverance and strength in both the pup and the folks who care for her! Thank you!
She’s adorable 🥺❤️
She got the perfect family with their pack of long doggies 🥰... A variety of long pups and they're adorable
She is absolutely precious!! 🥰At 9:47 + .... you can see a huge 'tick?' running on her head, though.. or the world's biggest flea ?  That can't be good for her oxygen levels ..given the amount of blood the suck, & her teency-tiny, diminutive size. 🥺 I didn't noticed that she also has heterochromia.  She's absolutely adorable!! 🥰
2:07
😢 ahhh this is the cutest thing ever!
Ur a great lady. All the best for u and what you're doing
Her dedication to helping animals is like my own, when I find an animal that needs help I will help it, so if I ever get a job that isn’t a game creator or youtuber I’ll probably be a vet, her dedication is inspiring. And I’m glad vets are here today to help animals.
Pretty
uwu
The thumbnail made me think of Chainsaw man.
Bubble girl was going out like: GIRL STOP PUTTING ME IN THE BUBBLE
I LOVE U LITTLE SALLY🐕🐾💕
Im so glad sweet Sally finally found her wings.
As soon as the video started: Me:  TAKE MY OXYGEN I DONT NEED IT
What a great story! You are the best!
Bubble Puppy was an obscure band. Good name.😃
Wait is one of her eyes brown and the other blue? That is so cool! ❤
I am also a 75-year-old man. I am sobbing on the metro bus.
Please go to my page and consider the information souls are in jeopardy
Beautiful story .. God bless you all.. and may sally enjoy a long and joy filled life.
Why that puppy she or he so cuteeeeeeeee!!!!!!
A touching story of perseverance. And Proof that honorable people exist. And inspiring to be a that great person that the world needs more of.
AWWWW such a strong girl! 🥰❤
God bless 🙌 🙏 ❤️
Sweet little miracle ❤

This woman deserves a mama of the year award. And that bubble baby girl... 🥰

I really enjoyed the video, The Puppy is adorable 🤗
<3 live a  long happy life sally
I WOULD BE SOOO GUILTY, FROM OPENING HER BUBBLE, AND LEAVING 💋💋💋💋💋💋, ALL OVER HER?! 😍😍😍😍
I love it how she just jumps into her bubble
What breed is this?
I love you guys SM, you understand that animals have souls and feelings too, it hurts even more seeing animals get abused, abandoned, hurt. 😢I’m really happy that you guys are not selfish I love y’all SO MUCH ❤
Omg this is the sweetest video I have seen in a long time! How stinking cute is Sally?!?!
Look at this Motley Crew. ! Totally in love ❤
I fell in love right away, haha. I hope she has a great life, I’m glad she got such a good home and that she’s able to live outside of the bubble ♥️
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This I just so special literally I cried all way through she is something very special truly one of a kind 💗 so happy to see her happy and healthy blessings to you all who helped her along the way ❤
World: *super hard to live in with little to no room for weakness*  The willpower of this dog:
THANK YOU FOR LOVING HER....
A wonderful example of how love heals.
Poor baby
The two of you are the angels for the work that you do🥰
Fluffy baby 🥺
Aw, she knew the bubble was her safe space and she knew when she didn't need it anymore.
😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
😍😍😍
Natural selection, never heard of it
This is such an awesome story
It's the smallest ones with the biggest hearts. To we often believe that  hate is the opposite of love but from their point of view fear is loves opposite, this is why pups are so often fearless the result of being too full of love.
so cute💕💕💕and beautiful puppy
Thumbnail almost looks like Pochita
Okay what kind of dog is that!!
Amazing story of hope , perseverence and love. Thank you!
This was one of the best rescue stories ever, such a great journey to a healthy girl🙏💕🐾
My dog's name is Sally!
Omg🥺🥺🥺🥺
Happiness!
I’m so happy for Sally!!!!
“The Oxygen” Well, that’s a concept I’d never thought that a dog would have to learn and adapt around.
Amazing story it gets better each time I watch it
🥺🥺🥺🥺 poor baby
Awesome work 😎✌️
😭😭🎉🎉👍

♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🙏🙏🙏
😇😇😇😇👍

You guys are angels.

😭😭😭😭😭🙏
I'm literally crying.... look at this precious little angel!
POCHITAAA
Pochita
Hello I love you video. I was curious on how you guys were able to change her bubble blankets without hurting her or affecting her breathing in the beginning.
The fact that they let her set her progression rate tells me they know how to care for animals.
TOO CUTE!!, I don’t want to be in the bubble. I’m for the streets now!!  ❤️
I don’t know why this dog reminds me of pochita
She's too cute.  I'm so glad people exist who care for animals.
Adorable ❤
Don't tell me. She got named after the actress.
I commend you so your patients, diligence, and love for that sweet baby.  Thank you for who you are.
I love love love stories like this and God Bless you all for showing such love and dedication to these lil fur babies
Sometimes my lungs get so bad I feel like I need an oxygen bubble. I wonder where Michael Jackson got that coffin thing he slept in, id love one of those.
You are a very special lady. God Bless you
Awesome story!!!
With all the children in need in this world woman today have only an exhaustive energy for animals.
deserves a raise
Was that O2 tubing taped to her head/face in the beginning or was it an NG feeding tube?
Omg she is so adorable best wishes sweetheart an thank you to everyone that is part of her recovery so you know Sally someone loves you from Monessen Pennsylvania ❤❤❤❤🙏🏼 an god love her that she knew that her bubble was her save place 😢 she is such a beautiful little soul ❤
Nothing more fulfilling than seeing a child or animal being loved right. Having the life and love they deserve.  Amen
Thats gotta be the cutest lil thing i ever seen
Thumbnail looks like pochita from chainsaw man
Fuk ur dog I’m playing black light retribution tdm and I’m hitting clips
this Channel gives disney and pixar INFINITE material
ITS SO EMOTIONAL 😢
❤️❤️❤️
Godbless you two 😢❤
AWWWWW🥺🥺🥺🥺😅
I would have just put her down.
Very inspiring but how the dog poo
I would give her some oxygen from time to time just in case tho
God bless the rescuers! I love these positive stories of survival! She is a fabulous little girl! I’m so glad she has an awesome life! ❤❤❤
This breeder ought to be punished for breeding for money and animal cruelty for not taking care of these puppies and I would let everyone know what breeder this is so no one buys animals from her. She needs to be stopped. Anyone who neglects animals to breed them for money is pathetic.
So sweet living her best life😍
Wow...its a wondeeful family....
I gotta get home and pet my dog 😭😭
Amazing story!! And Amazing caretakers.  Just amazing. God bless you. ❤❤❤
BLESS SALLY'S LITTLE HEART 🐕 she is super adorable & I'm so glad she was adopted by a loving family that's the first thing I thought of when they said she got adopted I was like she needs a loving home & family she's so special & thank God she has that bc that's what she deserves... ur awesome SALLY keep living u best life & it's so freaking cute she knows when she needs to chill out bc if her lungs especially in the beginning when she needed the bubble she just knew U ROCK SALLY KEEP LIVING U BEST LIFE ❤🧡💜💚💙🤘💥🐕!!
First off my RESPECT for the team.... doctors, care takers that made everything possible for Sally to become a little warrior and a fighter. Sally fought hard for not giving up. That part that I love about Sally is when Sally was in trouble medically she knew her way back to bubbles on her own account. My god she'd fought very hard for her life. But also to the beautiful lady that took care of Sally medical attention fought hard too and that is where she earned my deepest RESPECT and love indeed. Sally is one happy warrior and beautiful absolutely gorgeous. Keep us updated on Sally medical attention medically and take a good care of Sally because we love Sally and those involved 🥰❤️🥰😍😍🥰😍🥰🥰❤️🥰😍😍🥰😍
she is just the most beautiful thing!  So wonderful you all could get her to such a good place!
She is just so adorable! But reason she even had a chance was for the love, patience and persistence of the foster lady. Thank you for what you do ma'am
The thumbnail picture is one of the cutest i have seen
This is one of the most adorable "puppy" videos I have ever seen. She is just toooo cute! Thank you ladies for the devotion that you had in saving her life and having a chance to be the precious pooch that she now is. Is she a long haired dachshund? All she has ever known is love--how wonderful to be able to say that.
Dachshunds only go 2 ways that I've seen Love Water or detest water with their ENTIRE  being 🤣
So Sweet and Cute!  Little Warrior.
What a brave puppy
Perseverance
Thank god for loving people like your selves. Sweet pup!!
🥹
Bless everyone that helped this beautiful pup. ❤
Why is she so cute😆💓
I can't even tell how much I love people who helps and gives so much love and patience to animals!
These people are saints.
When watching stories I always feel so thankful towards the kind people that go all out to help animals in need. They will have such a good karma.
0:45 SHE LOOKS SOOO CUTE doing that little call
What was in her nose?
BEAUTIFUL
These story’s always suck because these dogs get so attached to these people just to be turned loose to someone else
Wow, this is extraordinary vet who take care of puppy is very brilliant and give puppy a good life. I am glad that puppy will have great future.
God bless these two incredible humans and I wish that beautiful creature her BEST LIFE ❤️🙏🏾
One of the best turnarounds so far.
OMG. That was the MOST fun watching. So so cute. And Sally is a cute name. You can see how happy she is. Loved that!!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Wow... you are all wonderful!
Such a brave little girl
I WOULD BE VERY COMFORTABLE IN HER BUBBLE.....
omgggg
What an amazing story!! Thanks for sharing.❤️
Aww! Sally the puppy in this video is so cute and adorable! I love puppies!
May Sally Have a long beautiful life 👍😍
Soooo sweet. And I’m glad she got her forever home ❤
"Breeder couldn't take care of her anymore"  no, she can just make thousands of dollars breeding dogs and making homeless dogs, but if one is sick then screw that dog, give  it away, someone else's problem.  All breeders and anyone who has ever bought an animal through a breeder is subhuman, should consider if they need to be here on Earth, make the right decision, end it, and leave the rest of us alone.
Thank God for dogs.
Bro that puppy is so adorable ❤
Cool story
Pochita!~
I absolutely love and respect the dedication of these people doing all that they can to save this beautiful puppy but it blows my mind whenever I think of the millions of human babies aborted and discarded like trash.
♥️♥️♥️♥️

Just one example of why breeders are the worst
It's just a dog , way too much effort Just for a dog.
I thought she was Pochita in the thumbnail for a split second 😳
Omgggg
UGH SHE IS A FIGHTER 🥰🥰😇😍😍😘
I love dogs but especially dachshunds.  I’m so happy Sally is healthy and safe !🥰
It's so nice to see them get better ❤️
She could have been put down humanely, and all that money and resources used to help spay dogs and help healthy dogs.
Bruh Thats adorable
they hot boxxing that lil doggie
So patience they are her angels
a very interesting video
What a cute brave puppy we need more sweet people like you ^^ x
What a phenomenal job you did !!! She's so beautiful and especially happy being a loved puppy 🥰🥰🥰
You are truly an amazing and caring person. Sally melted my heart.
what dog breed is this?
Awesome !!
She reminds me of pochita 🥺✨❤️
Why does the dog look like pochita from chainsawman? I guess i watch anime too much
Two women full of Love and kindness ❤  Thank you ! How precious
so cute ❤
I saw a cat that was comeing to me that got it’s tainted bitten off On Sunday
Awesome pup 😍 Awesome family 💞 Awesome people 😁 ________________________  I wish everyone good luck 🤞 Being kind gives you a good feeling. Watch bad guys if u don't know what I mean But still I love this puppy and I adore the family And of course I adore the puppy too 💕💕💕💕 Have a good day everyone and good night It's 8:46pm by time I finished typing this 💞💞
What breed is Sally???🥹 Sooooo pretty! 😍
You are amazing! ❤😢
This is beautiful! ❤
Dedicated people do great things
I love the way she trots with her stubby little feet ❤
Such a beautiful story! I didn't understand what was going on. But I hope my comment helps somebody else. This little puppy is so stinking cute!
I really don't think people know the power of a nebulizer! And I think that really helped this pup, and people with COPD could use a little bit of that to help them as well! But, I am so glad that you figured that one out. I guess you probably knew that anyways. Thank you for this video!
I really hate dogs but that has to be the cutest puppy I have ever seen
The more I hear murderers on the news the more I wish I was a dog. She’s so worthy ❤ I really hope  Sally gets stronger she’s worth a good life 💕
thank god for these people.  bawling.
God 🙏😇 bless everyone
Little champion.
Oh she is adorable 💛🧡❤️
I adopted 2 rescue dogs, and one hated the water and the other one loved to play in it. One loved riding in the car but the other one didn't. I just respected that fear and they were the best watch dogs ever.
is she a Duck Toller or a Dachsund?
She is a warrior and beautifull angel. I hope that she be ok ❤️🐕
I cannot help but be impressed by the recovery of the poor puppy. This is also because of the tender loving care of the foster mom most of all and the love and care of the adoptive mom. Thank you for your kindness and efforts to help the puppy become healthy and live a normal life.
This feels like it could be a parody of a alien species that stole a dog from earth and was trying to force it to live in a environment non livable for earth life.
Most most beautiful toy Sally is
Pochita
ALL of my dogs were sick,tiny,and dying when i found /adopted them.  I had to keep them in my shirt to keep them warm and feed them and give meds every 2hrs no matter what.  Even had to break up pneumonia fluid in their chests every 45min and keep their head elevated so they wouldnt drown inside their lungs.  I pray very hard and rock them all night long.  They are alive today because of me
Omg....such a beauty,bt so painful life...God🙏🙏..plz plz bless this angel baby immensely..😭
I am so truly happy there are kind and loving people like this in this woeld!
How to like video 98 times?
put a plant next to her to see if she do something
Oh Sally you are so sweet!❤️❤️
That’s amazing story
I now need to love on my doggies.
Healthy and happy!
Thw work, the effort put in making this small creature to live, is heart melting. Thank you for do what you do.
A perfect little being ,what a joy to see her grow ,how could anyone not love her .
This made me feel a lot of emotions, I enjoyed watching her process of getting better :')
I’m gonna cry😢😢
So smart❄️🐻
Such a beautiful dachshund! It truly shows how strong willed they are!
👌🏾👌🏾🥺🥺😢😀😃🥹😅
What a beautiful story... Kudos to everyone who participated in her recovery....
Poor baby girl this is making me so sad and what strong will pup 😭 😊

Pretty puppies
Very cute
I’m so happy the cute little pup finally got to live in the world and be a normal puppy
Words fail me as to how to describe my heartfelt love for the little puppy and the humans who gave everything to her.  Wonderful people and totally wonderful little girl 🤗
those women are proof that angels are real
Why did the owner give that dog a messed up nose ring?
Y’all have so much heart and dedication to help fellow living things less fortunate.
You are such an amazing and compassionate human …. All the patience and love for this lucky Baby! God BLESS you with abudance of Health Happiness and Wealth! ❤❤❤Thank YOU
She is so cute! ❤ I feel so bad for the puppy she so adorable!
I did a google search of the Dodo and everyone says they are all fake animal rescues. If this is true you guys need to stop.
Pochita
OMG SO GLAD SHE GOT BETTER SO CUTE
Front cover looks a little like pochita
What kind of dog is her!!!!!OMG
The Dodo Comeback Kids
The dog always had an upbeat attitude. Even, when she was stuck in the O2 tank.
What kind of dog is Sally?
I am crying like a baby. This pup is so cute and tough.
BUBBLE BUBBLE BUBBLE PUPPY PUPPY PUPPIES BUBBLE BUBBLE BUBBLE PUPPY PUPPY PUPPIES BUBBLE BUBBLE PUPPY PUPPY BUBBLE PUPPIES
I have adopted so many senior dogs that have disabilities and it is hard work but it is so rewarding. They are the best thing to have come into my life and I am so grateful when I see videos like this. Sally is the sweetest most beautiful little baby and I think God that there was somebody there for her. Bless you all for so much that you do. It melted my heart to see her enjoying being a puppy when she was adopted. In the toilet paper scene? Oh my gosh I laughed so hard!!!
I am in tears.... That poor baby! Praying!!!
I honestly can't watch dodo vids.  They stress me out too much, make me cry too easy, and THIS is a bad one.
Uwu
gas chamber puppy
I love her so much 💞
Adopt don’t shop
This is so beautiful 🥰 what great work and dedication, and it paid off 👌🙏♥️
so cute
Staggeringly beautiful animal, so much tenacity 💗💗💗
Got my nightly dose of tears and joy watching these videos. It's so great that there are people that are dedicated and care for animals like this.
Truly dedicated application of therapeutic devotion to an animal in need, would the oxygen "bubble" be unsuitable for a puppy without that specific need, as in, could she have had company ?
Chuchito 😊
The day her lungs finally healed, she was like "Guys I don't need the bubble any more... I can breathe! I CAN BREATHE!"
lets fucking GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Doeg
What a beautiful thing this women did so the puppy would survive, KOODOOS to you.that baby is so perfect now.
CUTE!
Aww sally so small
Just take my money!!! All of it!! How precious was this!!!
go sally!
The Dodo Comeback Kids
I want her
Dog
Cute pup
HEY LITTLE BABY !! WHOS A GOOD BOY ? YOU ARE! :3
Just want to say to the women who is a vet, you are just overqualified in this world, you are generous and big respect for your dedication ❤
Thank you !!!
" *That's a good girl* ."
I had put off watching this video for a long time. I finally watched it and I'm glad I did. The will to live that Sally showed was unbelievable. It goes to show that when animals have a loving home, the right medical attention and care, they will push past all odds... they have a reason to keep going. Thank you to the women who helped this little angel flourish and not give up.
Can I. Have her
aw so cute 🥰
Aww the little weenie baby 🥺🥺
Che amore😍😍😍😍😍🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶
omg
I think this video just made me want to be a veterinarian. ❤️
Can you imagine the work that goes into taking care of a puppy?  Let alone a puppy that need 24-hr medical care (with oxygen, for god's sake). This is time-consuming and very stressful. This wonderful angel took care of this dog so well, that it overcame it's health shortcomings. God bless you for taking care of this small, helpless being.. You are a true earth angel 💖💖💖💖💖💖🙌🙌
I love this story, I have watched it a few times and it always makes me smile, thank you for sharing your story, it truly warms the heart.
:)
👍
What a beautiful puppy and I feel so bad for her. Thank God for you and the O2 tent. Most people don't know how to take care of that puppy let alone have the equipment to handle her. She's adorable what a little bugger. Enjoy 🤠
The Dodo Comeback Kids
She had a rough start, but she's doing just fine now with a family who can give her all the love she deserves.
They care more about pet lives then humans. Put the dog down, that's life.
I love her ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Aww so adorable. Wish i had a dog
There are some humans, and then there are SOME humans. These folks are certainly not the latter. This is what we are supposed to do - take care of one another - as we are all God's creation. I am truly happy for this little dog's health improvement and I pray for the health and happiness for her people as well.😊🙏🏿
There are Angels walking amongst us here on Earth. These wonderful ladies.... I'm absolutely floored by their dedication and unwavering love for these pups. I wish them nothing but happiness and joy.
sally is cute with her heterochromia :3
The Best Video from this channel. ❤❤❤
That vet is a treasure!!!
You’re such an angel and not only the world loves you but god as well , you’ll always have a special place in our hearts , May you live well and stay safe all the time!
This has to be one of the cutest dogs ever
Was this a congenital issue?  Or were her lungs severely damaged after recovering from pneumonia?  It must have been so hard not being able to cuddle her in the bubble. I feel such love for the people who gave so much to little Sally. Now she's so happy and so loved. She's just adorable. Thank you!  God bless you.
Seeing her gasping broke my heart
Sell it to me
my god...😭 im crying💜💜💜💜
What breed is she?
❤❤❤❤❤❤ beautiful people and an amazing puppy
Awesome , you are an Angel.. 🙏❤️
what breed is she?
⛓️🪚🧍🏼‍♂️
Dogs have such spirit! Sally just wants to love and be loved.
This is great！
When sally picked her toy. I knew this precious girl is all going to be all alright
So like for a few months after my brother died this kinda happend to me but it stoped and 8 didn’t need to bubble I just kept going outside and get deep breath’s and also yea
is dis pochita
She would come find it the next time she came by, and always put it back when she left. She was 14 when she gave up the ghost.
What a cute little nugget
What breed is she
small dogs are literally a mutated version of animals that we bread until they could no longer fend for themselves in the wilderness, if I could, I'd keep small dogs from reproducing so no more small dog births happen, so they don't have an entire life of nothing but hardships
You’re a true heroine! God bless beautiful soul… ❤️🙏
Dog looks like pochita
I am wondering why they haven't tried lowering the oxygen amount gradually?
I CAN NOT! SHES SO ADORABLE
POCHITAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Imagine if this was just before COVID and they couldn't afford the oxygen cause it was too expensive
I want to pet her so bad...she needed so many pet and cuddles...poor baby
This dog low-key looks like pochita in the thumbnail 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
That dog low-key looks like pochita on the thumbnail 🤣🤣🤣
Tell me why I’m scrolling and saw the chainsaw man demon. Great story though
I thought the thumbnail was a pochita cosplay
Strong dog
Such a nice ending. Amazing job.
Thumbnail makes him look like potchita from chainsaw man
This is the stuff i see at 3AM. These animal videos always make me happy! These make my day better.
So gosh damn cute I wanna hug the pup So much, but i can't So i hugged my phone anyways
Modern humans are a peculiar species.  This type animal would have been a goner 50 or more years ago.  It also would not have existed without modern breeding.
thumbnail looks like pochita
aw so cute puppy
do you like ducks?
Thank you for being an amazing human being
Chainsaw man pochita!
I wanna steal her
Why is Geico sponsoring this?😊
We had this kitty pool on our porch in our backyard, and when we first Got Enzo, he wouldn’t even think about going near it, and about a year later, he started to lay in it when it was hot out side. He even learned how to splash in the water! 😂
What a Cute puppy 🐶❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.
she can now touch grass.
So cute😍😍😍😍😍
Pochita ?
The pup deserved a new home
AWWW MY GOD MY HEART
If being adorable was a crime she would get a life sentence
I'm just glad oxygen exists...
There's alot of sad horrid things in life. But we gotta hold onto these things as much as we can. Whether there are more, equal or lesser than the bad times, they matter more.
Missed opportunity to call her "Bubbles" than Sally!
THAT LITTLE RUN 😭❤
SHES SUCHA FIGHTER
She’s a bubble guppy!!
Cute puppy. Thank you for your patience, caring  and kindness. World needs more of you :)
Omg she’s so precious
The thumbnail look like pochita without his saw
It's so wholesome that the baby bubble bean managed to get her lungs back in working condition ❤️❤️
what an amazing success story...... it's so so cool that just one day she decided to stay out of the bubble, and it's been a fun adventure since then. :) That's really awesome...... Love this story. Everyone here did a great job of raising her and healing her. :)
This is the reason I could never be a vet. I'd get way too attached.
Is it just me or does it kinda look like pochita from chainsawman?
Hello
This made me cry😭😭😭
Does the puppy every use the bubble anymore?
This is too cute for me. Nope, way to cute. Sally is just the most amazing dog I’ve seen. She is so brave!
When I saw this I cried. She’s so cute and adorable I’m so happy that she was able to find a home.
OMG THAT'S POCHITA FROM CHAINSAWMAN
unconditional love
Aww
What a cutie
I love this kind of stories <3
I thought the breathing tube in the thumbnail was a giant fishing hook through the dog's nose, my blood pressure dropped for a second
No way she looks like pochita
Pochita??
How dose she eat?
This was a great video. I just had to put my 15 1/2 YO Jack Russell-Laso “Clinger” to sleep because of a tumor. We had him since he was 5 weeks old. He was a survivor like this puppy, he had 3 bladder stone surgeries, major back surgery and survived all that like a champ. Even with his tumor he never showed any slowing down or pain till the end. This puppy reminds me of him, a survivor! Thanks for this video, it made me smile and is definitely a feel good story. Many people would have just given up. You have made this puppy’s life something special and definitely show love back. Thank you!
Pochita
Sally is so cute!
She’s so cute 🥰 🥰 🥰 🥰
Kinda sad that puppy lost her "mother", to some dogs hoarder...
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT BREED OF PUPPY THIS IS
Omg. This puppy looks Pochita

Lil doggie gotta level up to unlock new maps😊
wait ive seen u on pinterest lol, great videos and the animals uve rescused they're adorable
im glad that she was born with  a lot of angels totake care of her.
Ngl.. Why does this pup remind me of that boy.. Who was in a bubble because he can’t go out without leaving. Otherwise his oxygen will run out.  Search his story in YouTube I think it’s called bubble boy.. So uh.. It’s a very old story and I’m sure there is some people documenting about it.
Just beyond words, adorable
I shall call you baby Pochita.
There's no way I'd be able to give that dog up after doing all that for her.
When you don’t have an aggressive dog😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He smol
I love the little waddle
With the air tube on her face she looks like pochita from chainsaw man

Puppy..🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Whats the thing on her head?
❤️
Especially for older people its just nice to have disabled dog. The Podenco of my mum is 3,5 legged and is essentially for her daily life.
Bless your souls ❣️
I gotta watch about 2 hours of explosions and violence to recover from this video 🥲🥰
I wish hes ok now😔
little puppy that could. "I think I can.  I think I can.  I think I can."  And then she did.
I really want to touch the puppy on the head so cute she is so brave to live
it just makes your heart melt
So cute😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘
Amazing there are still people out there willing to sacrifice to save an animal life. These things take time and money, but eventually you'll have a friend for life.
Such a sweet puppers
she’s is so cute!!!
It is very possible and commonly found in small animals and small children that the sinuses are allergically infect due to older animals feces , hair and dandruff.
Breed of this cutie?

Awe.  She's so cute.  Well done you!
5:47 that's what i call a slippy dippy with my dog charlie.

Greatness from small beginnings.

Thought it was pochita in the thumbnail
SHES SO ADORABLE
sandy cheeks
What a wonderful story 😊 I am glad she live.
Well this is probably the nicest thing I’ve seen in a long time
Dogs are the best kind of people. They are truly worthy of these women's help and dedication.
You are great people. Im glad you were able to safe this little pupper!!
She’s so cute🥺😥
I just kept crying 😭 also she is adorable ❤ I was evening laughing 😂
God Bless You! 💕
God bless
baby <3
what a precious little being.
Puppy Boobel puppy
Don’t normally comment but really impressed with the dedication of the vet techs and this brilliant outcome. I am not a massive dog person but this is a lovely little dog!
Hallo
She's so cute sad
just kill it... make a another one
Omfg I'm crying 😭💕 Sally is so beautiful. She's going to have the best life ever!!
My oldest baby Jacey had kennel cough that developed into pneumonia and had to be in a nebulizer every morning for a few weeks. It was tough, and she was so strong through all of it. My youngest Shenzi was hit by a drunk driver a few years ago and had to have her pelvis reconstructed. We had to reteach her to walk and within a week or two she was already trying to do walk on her own. She didn't want our help. Dogs are resilient and have such a strong will to survive and live. They have taught me many things, and I don't know where I would be without them.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Babies can need to be in oxygen tents for months to years, same w/ puppies.What a great story of patience and love.
I feel so bad for this little baby I hope she lives a long healthy life I pray she gets all the love and support she needs I’m so happy that she recovered it made me feel so happy 🥲🥲🥲🥲💙💙💙
God bless these people.
This made me tear up a little. I get over excited when I see something cute with animals, especially when it’s a baby, and I get over excited over other things, and it gets to the point where I have to stop and calm down and breathe, and when I get over excited I do this thing with my fingers where they just go crazy and I do a BIG smile on my face, or I would keep that big smile on my face and I would jump up and down and flop my hands around when I jump. And that’s what I did when watching this video. I hope that pup has a long happy life. ❤😊
9:41 that is good dog
The meaning of determination

Thanks for sharing this beautiful story and fighting for her. She's adorable!
Good work people. Stay beautiful sally
Atleast these parents teach their pets  Unlike others who love the pet so much they wont teach it anything
SHE SO CUTE
pochita netflix adaptation zheesh?!!
She so cute 😍
is it just me but when i saw the thumb nail i thought the dog was role playing as pochita from chainsaw man
I guess now she has a bubbly personality
bro i thought that was pochita
Anyone else click the video because the thumbnail looked like Pochita from Chainsawman?
When I saw this little baby my heart melted and I want to steal her so bad
The way she sniffed the dog butt lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
so cute
I hope she's doing wel !!😍
Besides how sad this is, THAT PUPPY IS FRICKING ADORABLE❤
She looks like Falkor.
You guys are heroes ❤
this actually made me cry!! shes absolutely precious and im so glad it worked out!
so adorable!!! such a cool story
I don't understand why she needed to be in a bubble like that. Isn't oxygen everywhere already?
so cute
so stinky cute bro little thing is adorable
when she was howling because she wants to explore :(
Dog finally touches grass :)
Oh my god the cutest thing ever
A classic Bubbles to Badgers story
alright who cutting the onions
Omg pochita
Me when he/she said purple dinosaur. My mind : uhm do you mean Barney?
The fact that when she’s walking she just suddenly rolls is so flipping CUTEEE  Edit: MOM IM FAMOUSS!! Btw I’m subscribing to whoever is at the top of the comment section :)
What breed is she❤❤
I love all animals but this dog is so cute and I am so happy that she made it out alive and she reminds me of myself when I was younger because when I was younger I used to be hooked up to an oxygen tank to couldn’t breathe because I was born premature
SHES SO PRECIOUS
❤
I love this video I watched it like 50 times
She’s so cute
kinda looks like Pochita
I cried like a baby watching this video. ❤
1:10 cant open the chamber *proceds to open*
What was the tube on her nose for?
AWEEEEE I WANT IT SOOO BAD
❤❤❤😊😊
Omg her tail never stopped wagging
The people in this video should be blessed, such amazing persons. <3
Absolutely angelic work. When the bible talks about natural affection this is what it is referring to.
what a pretty baby
Thank you, for saving Sally.
What breed is it?
honestly it goes to show how advanced we are. 100 years ago, this dog had no chance of living, even in the best medical facility of the time. what a time to be alive, despite the shortcomings
Give me
Tight collar on the neck!!! Terrible treatment, owner should be reported to the police for that! Stupid people should not have animals. American people, the worst people treating pets very bad! And Russian too!
She went from "Crap i need my bubble." To "*huff* im tired, lemme go back to my bed."
God bless you.
as someone who as four dogs her story socks me i hope she find a parent soon
Great work!!!!
What breed is this
She's so cute I want to cuss.
Pure joy, thanks for sharing. 72 yrs
I bet humans can not receive this level of care...
ngl i fkn hate breeders but side note this puppy is so precious MY HEART
I admire to what have you done for a cute Sally.
I can't understand what is going on now, when the life of more than 8 billion human beings and the other living being is on the hands of two men dominated by their ego, and we don't even know. This video is a the reflect of the HUMAN NATURE always ready to care for others..... LET'S SEE WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE END of all this time we are going trough
Good job! You are saints!
¡¡LA FUERZA DE SALLY ES IMPRESIONANTE!! ¡¡GRACIAS POR SALVAR A UNA CRIATURA TAN BONITA, SIMPÁTICA Y CARIÑOSA!! 😎👏👍 Saludos desde España 🇪🇦
while most people would give up on her, these ladies didn't. this is a miracle. you ladies are angels.
dog breeding is disgusting!
I'm a 75 year old man.  You made me cry.  God bless you!!!!!
Bubble….. I can see bubble every where… the laugh after a tear was the most beautiful…
I really don't understand how she doesn't keep her , and instead, she give her to her friend, how can she doesn't have a strong feeling for her after all that process...
Such patience and dedication these ladies had! Just imagine having to care for a pet that way.  These ladies are the real superheroes.
almost cried and I was really angry thanks for sharing this beautiful story
I’m lucky to get 10 minutes with my doctor….
POOOOCCCCCCHHHHIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTAAAAAAA!!!!!
Getting her used to water and swimming is such a good idea! My lungs were small when I was younger, and then our doctor asked my mother to get me swimming lessons at the least for a whole year, to help my lungs to develop faster. Swimming helps a lot with the respiratory system!!
Thank you so much for not giving up on her ❤ this makes me so happy
Wow I can't tell how glad I am that this little cutie got a chance to live, this is beautiful
Dogs for dogs 🐕
What a wonderful story! Thank you!! I am currently going through chemotherapy and T-Cell therapy.  Watching that puppy full of live and never giving up was a delight to watch!!  Once again, thank you!!
I love how every frame with sally has her tail wagging❤
This story is so heartwarming that it’ll make a grown man cry. Long live Sally!
So happy she made it ...💛💛💛 Thank you for all you did for her . Ive got pnemonia now ,,and its so tiring ... Seeing her so small and her lungs working so hard .. It really does take everything out of you .  What an amazing family you all are . Hope Sally lives a long wonderful happy strong life now . God bless your beautiful golden cotton socks. 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
She is so cute OMG
1,500 dislikes?Really?😧
I feel like putting her outside isn't the best idea if you want her to breath properly, start out inside until she can breath longer than just 5 minutes, then you can try to bring her outside to see if there is any difference between breathing inside than outside and work on the problem if there is one.
Amazing work getting Sally back to heatlhy so she can enjoy the marvels of life. You ladies and evryone like you, who work tirelessly to get animals and people back to a heathly state while being professional and compassionate, are the true heros in life. Bless all of you.
We need to understand that being at the top of the pyramid of creation means that everything we do trickles down the structure, from top to bottom. When it reaches the bottom, the inanimate level of reality, from which everything grows, it changes it. If we ooze ill-will, it creates negative changes throughout the system, which manifest in increasingly extreme climatic and geological events. In other words, when human relationships go out of balance, everything goes out of balance. When our relations become extreme, everything becomes extreme; when we become violent, everything becomes violent. Each summer, the ramifications of the linkage between our relations and our world become more extreme, until we acknowledge that everything that exists, exists in a connected, hierarchical system and that whoever is at the top determines the state of the rest of the system. It is not as if previously, we were better people than we are today. It is simply that there were fewer people, and therefore fewer elements that exude ill will. Also, relationships between people in the past were less toxic than they are today. While there are fewer wars today than ever, the levels of suspicion and alienation between people are skyrocketing, to the point where people can no longer trust their own family members. As a result, wars between countries are rarer than ever, but divorce rates, domestic violence, and violence in the community, are at an all-time high. Even the internet, which we invented purportedly in order to connect people, is being used to abuse, deceive, and exploit people. The world-wide-web proves that everything we create, we use against others. When there is such a negative element in a system, and that element is at the top of the system, how can the entire system not go awry? Therefore, if we want the weather to cool, the sea-level to drop, and the storms to subside, we must cool the fire and calm the storms between us. Mutual concern, mutual responsibility, or at least the knowledge that we are dependent on each other, are necessary in order to restore balance in our world at all levels, from the ground we walk on to the hatred in our hearts.
Awe.. kind of broke my heart finding out you didn’t keep the dog and had a friend adopt it.. all that love and care for the princess.. it would of been family after all of that care and love.
What a total lovey! Take some very patient person to nurse another little baby. I'm so glad that you did that! God bless you!
Dogs new owner is a heffer
I LUV SALLY!!
The moment your numb to human travesty yet you'd do absolutely anything for animals cause there not evil like us.
Bless your hearts for not giving up on her!!!
Sadly she believes the moops invaded Spain in the 8th century.
😻😻😻😻😻😻
She is so precious in every way. She has been truly Blessed to have such amazing care givers ❤
I cried like a baby. I’m a 25 year old man what a shame
Anyone else cant stop thinking about the "Bubble Boy" from Seinfield? lol
Wow. We really love dogs more than each other..
These people make the world worth while ❤️
So remarkably awesome ❤ a warm and touching story that reminds one to never give up❤
Good job kid
💖💖💖💖
Thank you for taking care of her she’s so cute how is she doing now?
❤❤
Shes a little cutie I would show her so much love and bring her everywhere shes the sweetest baby ever
She is so precious aww.
The world still has a chance with people like these. ❤️
If i have asthma or breathing difficulties from time to time from allergies, I dont want anything to do with being in water either. Cant breathe water. Understandable, pretty smart little dog.
How amazing people like this exist is beyond me. This lady and her team and all people who help animals, be it rescue, fostering, adopting, and so on are  beyond amazing! They make me seem as if I am evil because they are so good. Helping animals and people that can not pay you back is absolutely amazing! This video is so beautiful and breaks my heart. I am feeling all these emotions that is making me cry. Thank you all for what you do for these animals.❤
👍
This is incredible I love dogs and puppy’s and I hope to adopt one day!!!❤❤❤❤
Crying for real . How such a cute nugget she is. And all you have done thanks 🙏🏻
❤️
Death: No matter what, your soul is mine, Little One! Humans, swooping in with technology: Not today, motherf*cker...
Jesus loves you all!
That cute
IM NOT CRYING I WAS CUTTING ONIONS
Bless her ❤😢
beautiful dogo, sad start,  but this is why I don't like dog breeds per se,  a dog breed implies a limited genepool, and that's like the royal families of old, it's only a matter of time before you're bunking with your sibling/cousin.  I like my uncontrolled metis dogos, and to that extent the strays are the best because they are most times smarter, more cunning and  vastly more resistant then pure breads.  Till now my family has owned both pure breads and metis dogs, metis wins 100% ,  they get most of  the qualities of the pure breads with vary few if not no defects.     Also puppy mills are another reason  for me hating the idea of pure breads
When the day came and she was free-  "Mission control, come in mission control.  Oxygen levels are stable,  Fully ready to go."  *begins her journey out of the bubble.*  "One small step for pups, one giant doggy step for doggy-kind!"
Speechless❤❤❤ this is too beautiful!!!
💜 🐕 Sally Kathryn And Bonnie And Family  You Have Good Vibes Coming To You
❤❤❤ she’s so cute
all puppies are cute but Sally is a special kind of cute omg... <3
😢😢😢I'm so happy for that little pup!
🤲🤲💖💖
.  I have watched this video twice.  It is the most precious story/miracle I have watched on YouTube--and I have watched scores.  What love and determination on both the part of the carer and the puppy.  It is a joy to watch this--it is restorative.
Bless yr hearts

Dear Dodo, You fucking deserve the money the war lords get!
Que bonito animalito
😊
1:00 - 1:04 the cutest thing i have ever seen in my LIFE
What a wonderful, wonderful dog but the best were all the special people she has in her life...
Stop editing clips
Big issue is, as long as she is in a high oxygen envoirement, shell produce less red blood cells. she needs to get the oxygen reduced slowly, to get a chance at making enought red blood cells.
poor puppy
SHES SO CUTE
I need to boop thy bubble puppy
"but then,her realized she couldn't breathe" It's like when you go out-of-bounds in a first person shotter and you say: "It's real nice out here" *dies after the counter goes to zero*
What a strong little lassie. Bless her.
Amazing. Her treatment would have cost a fortune. Well done to the people who saw that she was worth it. She looks like she appreciates the gift of life she has been given.

God damn onion-cutting-ninjas 😭
"she was completely oxygen dependent."  I too, have to fight my crippling oxygen dependence, It's become really bad, I can't go 30 seconds without oxygen. Send help.

Thank you so much for doing this for helpless animals, made a tear in my eye.
I'm in my 30s and this is quite possibly the cutest thing I've ever seen.

Called a puppy mill, and you should kill those breeders
2:15 she’s soooo cute
im crying at how adorable this is
I love you
God bless
What if she poops or pees?
This happened to my puppy and he is energetic as this breathing angel😂❤
I work for a toy poodle breeder. It's awful. I'm only here to get through college. Many puppies don't make it through birth, more don't make it through the first three days. The worst are the puppies who make it to a month, then get sick and drop within a single day. Seeing this puppy thrive has me sobbing. I'm so glad she made it.
Aw she is so sweet, so tiny lol
I wonder how many oxygen tanks she went through.
No, I was so sad at first because I thought the title said “Decide she’s ready to leave the word”
Poor puppy having to be in abubble all day
IM NOT CRYING I SWEAR
Well I would of put it down that’s the best thing to do
das a good puppy
The moment Sally didn't want to go back inside the bubble, it made my heart just melt. Sally knew she didn't need the bubble anymore.
Wow, I thought she was a cavalier spaniel but turns out a dachshund... I'd love a dog but I couldn't stand to lose it when it passes, same reason I could never have kids, it would be miserable if anything ever happened to them I'd be a mess of worry all the time.
I'm glad she was able to recover from such a harsh ordeal at the start of her life. Thanks for uploading!
So sweet May God bless all of you for this ❤️✝️🙏🏼✝️
This is so cute I’m so happy that people are nice to Certain people and animals
LOVE ❤️YOU 😍 💖
Oh God. Precious angel
What a precious baby. So glad she got the chance she needed!
This is the best story that i have seen so far.   Sally is a fighter and thank you to all who just never gave up on her.
💋🐕🤍💙💜🧡🌻👍
this woman is the hero I aspire to be
I'm following this channel for quite some years, but this is the first time a video actually made me tear up. Bless all the people that worked so hard to make it possible for her to live a normal life!
God bless those that love and care for the animals💝!
I fucking love dogs
Oh god, i'm gonna cry...the amount of cuteness is too much for my heart. Thank you so much for saving this little pup QvQ
Aww
Hehe
the point that she was like unlocking new worlds
The thumbnail 😭💕💕💕
i have the same exact blankie! my doggos love it, sally is so cute. i just wanna squeeze her! shes a little bubble merpuppy <3 thank you for saving this beautiful baby.
sigma
she's kinda like me I had severe lung failure at birth and had to be hooked up to all sorts of machines
Breaks my heart
SO CUTE, SO SO CUTE...I LOVE HER. WONDERFUL 😍
Sally, she is soooo awesom tiny girl ! Love her 💕 😍 ❤️
My heart 🙏😍😭😭❤
❤❤❤❤
What a precious baby! That little jump back in her plexiglass kennel was so cute!! 😍😁
Such a precious little baby!! God bless this angel working so hard to save this baby ❤❤
She is too wonderful. Hope everything good for her
What a lovely story. Thank you for helping this sweet puppy to have a lovely life.🙏🤣
wow...
Very smart and adorable little dog.  Thank you all for mever giving up on her!
The thumbnail I just can't 💀
Miracle of life is not being alive, it is actually willing to be alive
What type of breed is that its so cute😭😭
ugly ass dog
This video is so fantastic and just watching Sally's journey is just wonderful to see 🧐🧐 I love this little puppy and seeing her grow is a Blessing 🙏🙏
Sally is just a strong little puppy and just adorable 😍😍 Thank You for giving her a lot of care and love
I wish I had the financial freedom to randomly care for some insignificant creature With a 20 year lifespan at the most and that’s being generous
That's when you say, "ok, this one is extremely geneticaly wrong to the point of not naturaly surviving on it's own, do I really want to keep it and potentialy let it pass those genes on?" Like, it looks like one of those breeds that are already geneticaly on the edge of breathing problems anyway.
Ahhh I can't stop crying. Good cry...good cry. Lol
She is a real angel 😻😇😇😇😇😇😇😇. I don't have this much patience and faith. Her efforts and confidence level is incredible ☺️
Great job. Thank you.
She's sooo sweet
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m a 19 year old guy so I don’t cry. But this is enough to make a grown man cry
Thank you for all your patience and care
what do you mean a breeder that don't have a facility to take care of their dogs?.........That like no.1 of to do list for a breeder....
❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
Thank You two for taking care of the beautiful little puppy dog! She's so adorable and lucky to have had you all to make sure that she was able able to get healthy and play with the big dogs!
Lol I noticed she chose a toy that was the same color as the bear she had as a baby
I loved the way she said uhm I don’t need this bubble anymore get it away from me! She really is such a fierce dog! And so adorable.
*reads title*  *INTENSE BUBBLE GUPPIES FLASHBACKS*  ALSO 13/10 VERY GOOD GIRL
He is soooooooo cute
What type of dog is she
I wuv 💗 you 💗 so much.  💓 words are not adequate.
This might not be related but I fell down a flight of stairs and its been hard to breath lately (this happened a few days ago) anyone got any answers ?
I love her :(
She is the definition of precious. I love good humans.
I found it very difficult not to tear up at this story I'm so happy that little pup got better it's night and day the progress Sally made all thanks to those amazing vet people doing that crucial daily exercise of her lungs the response of her wanting to come out of the bubble more and more was brilliant and now Sally has a good home and is living her best life !
what kind of dog is this
AAA is the best auto insurance ❤
I just love these wonderful stories of people going the extra mile to provide amazing lives for helpless and innocent animals! The sheer kindness involved always genuinely moves me!!!
this made me so happy ☹️
This is so heartfelt and a touching story! Thank you for sharing!
What a beautiful baby
The one thing we, people and animals, take for granted is BREATHING.   Seeing how, INCREDIBLY HARD, you all worked to give this puppy the chance to BREATHE was quite remarkable and impressive!   Animal carers like yourself never quite get the recognition you deserve for your services to animals. Your work should NEVER be taken for granted.  It takes an amazing and SPECIAL LOVE, PATIENCE, KNOWLEDGE and CARE to be able to assist these vulnerable and helpless creatures they way you do. GOD GAVE YOU ALL AN ASSIGNMENT...AND YOU UNDERSTOOD IT.  Thank you for this incredibly uplifting video! It was so touching! I am so happy for Sally 🥰 What a fighter 😅 😍 💝 🐶 🐕   I suffer from deep depression and once owned a beautiful cat, called Pelè but our landlord wouldn't allow pets in the building, so with great heartbreak and sadness we had to give him to my neighbour's daughter, who lived far away. It seemed she was NOT the best choice as she lost him within a few days and Pelè was never found 😔😢. We are still saddened by the loss😔, but would still like to own another cat. In England it is very hard to get a cat because every cat has to be registered and neutered. Most cats are sold through private cat breeders, who charge vasts amount of money for their cats, due to the demand and difficulty and being able to get one.  We still hope that one day we can have a beautiful cat again 🐱
You are heroooos! Thank you!
Aww that just melts my heart when I see people care so much about innocent animals, I am always bringing animals home to save.
You guys and Sally have the patience of a saint......
Grinning stupidly about the hope and beauty of this story! 🧡💚💛
Natural selection? I guess that’s a thing of the past.
What a cute girl
before i even finish the video i wanna know if she can be able to breath fine out of the bubble again?????
How beautiful is she? Two different colored eyes, long snout, and curly fur.... she's amazing! How awesome is she???❣️🤓
Bless these kind people
Im not crying
Oh my god she’s so cute.
Thank you for all you are doing for her. You’re all so patient with your patient.
I don’t know how I was recommended this but make a grown man cry I had to go show 7 year old daughter this is very cool most people would have let the pup past away
So now we are going to act like dogs can make decisions themselves, cool
Many many respect
Great job with her!❤
How do criminals have more rights than these angels?
The concentration of oxygen in normal air is only 21%. The high concentration of oxygen can help to provide enough oxygen for all of the organs in the body. Unfortunately, breathing 100% oxygen for long periods of time can cause changes in the lungs, which are potentially harmful so what's the story what % of oxygen was in the bubble?
i held my breath with her T_T
You are amazing, kind, generous people. Your heart and love is is as big as that little, determined puppy.
i love this
Something so tiny but with so much spirit and determination deserves a long and happy life
OH MYYYY she looks sooooooo cute!!!! ♡
Cutest thing I have seen this week. :)
"she could eck now"
1:01 2:14 is super cute Agree?   👇🏻
That is a very cute puppy🐶
Sally was like "I ain't gon let nothing stop meeee!!" She is the most precious perfect little babe oh my gosh I love her so much 💕💕💕
I literally can't tears are just running down my cheek she is so precious 💕
this program works great! exactly as I wanted
Never watched a YouTube video and actually thought when the video ends I'm gonna miss this puppy sooo much before.
aww
Look at her with her little sweater..  OMG too adorable 🥰🫶🐶
This story is so heart warming
so cute!!
Name her Bubbles
The fact that people still buy dogs from breeders are almost as worse as the breeders themselves. Purposely disfiguring an animal to fit a "cute" aesthetic is evil. I'm glad this puppy was given to someone who actually cares about animals.
Look at that waddle❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰😞
Poor baby
Well we need to stop breeding teacups period it’s sad to see
I HAVE THAT SAME TEDDY BEAR OMG DHJSKSJA
🥰🥰🥰
Sally in a 1 cm of water “get me out of here you monster! Help me!”  Kiddos “aww, she likes it!”  Hahahaha
Great story. I'm glad she eventually was able to be weaned off the oxygen and be a healthy normal dog.💖
This is so Sweet and the Family is Wonderful for doing that hard work. Well Worth It !
This reminds me of my goldfish a red ranchu he was so chubby and cute I always got him out for 5-10 seconds and hold him then put him back unfortunately he got sick and passed away but I’ll always remember him rest in peace little buddy i love the dog she’s such a little fighter
She's an angel But you guys are her Guarding angel 💗💗
She is so damn cute, what dog breed is this?
OML SHES THE MOST ADORAbubble PUP EVERRR <33333
Pure love! ❤️ Great job!
❤❤❤
Amazing dedication - amazing little puppy!!
This is the cutest video I have ever seen! Sally is a fighter! It's amazing how even as a small puppy she was so smart! She knew when she had to go to her bubble for oxygen! My neighbor has weenie dogs and I call them hot dogs and they bark whenever I call them that LOL. God bless to the lady who took care of Sally and thank you Bonnie for adopting beautiful Sally! I'm sure she is a great addition to your family 😌🤎🙊
Friend of mine, a professional truck driver had a female Aussie named Girl . I work at a Harley Davidson dealership that had a pet section. Girl would come pick out her own toy. Before they left, Girl would bring her new toy to my parts counter and leave it. She would come find it the next time she came by, and always put it back when she left. She was 14 when she gave up the ghost. RIP Girl ❤️🌹
So cute and so sweet
Her heart’s so strong, if I was her I’d probably give up ❤
OMG- 😭 my dog was laying on my bed as I was watching this and when it came to the part where she was playing with the squeaky toy, my dog just started tilting his head and looking for the noise. So frikin cute 😭😍
Lovely story, very wholesome
Aaawh
What an amazing story...I really needed to see this today
I hope she is ok an made me feel like I want to cry
I stopped to see your bubble puppy story and ask you if you ever heard of the band Bubble Puppy ?  They were my favorite band in the late 60s.
Good Girl Sally!!!! 🥰❤ What a wonderful little pal
Bless you both for what you do and have done
what a lovely doggy and a heart felt story
Sally is super cute but why would you give her up to a different person
Sally is so beautiful and so gorgeous!🥰🐕🥰
I love this. Thanks for the Video
So cute!!!
So awesome. Sally is such a cutie
You are such a great human.  Thank you for being so patient with her care!
My goodness, the amount of patience, time, and care this takes. Any other person would've simply given up on the life of this dog.
That is the dearest, sweetest thing ever.
God bless each of u involved in helping, healing and growing for Sally. To give her the gift of a love filled life.  Kudos
AWWWW
Tail going the whole time. Wow!
very cute
What breed Is sally?
its wonderful to hear about Sally,❤️
She was so tiny but you could tell "spunky" was waiting to finally strut her stuff ! God bless you all 🥰
Dogs are such ice l'il creatures
She is so teeny! Absolutely adorable… thank you for all the hard work and dedication and support you gave this beautiful girl! You are one tough, determined puppy, Sally! 🐾❤️🐾
That’s one brave soul. Against all odds.   You go sally 🙋🏾‍♂️
This is the best! ❤
So cute
What a beast. She's like Goku, just unlocking new levels of power.
It’s a really good training to keep her out of the bubble, even if everyday it would only be 5 seconds longer
Oh my goodness you cut little girl that is so cute
I am so glad there are people in the world who care this much. What a beautiful story.
It's amazing what lengths we go through for our pet's
I just realized she has heterochromia look at her eyes when she gets older
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🌹🌹🌹
Idk why i am struggling to intake oxygen while watching.?
What was the oxygen level used?
The dedication is just so heartwarming
Lovely story.
So precious!!
Such a good story. Sweet girl!
Six million dollar puppy.
It's nice that some committed animal loving people take the time to make sure these dogs have a chance at a long healthy happy doggy life.
Please tell me you named her something like “bubble” or “bubbles”
A really sweet story with such a happy puppy ending. Sally is a fighter, she is smart, curious, and she knows her boundaries and when she can push them and she does! I'm so happy for her and her family💕💕 Big love for all those who fought for her and worked to keep her healthy and strong! You are Angels and will be blessed for what you do, thank you!
The angels here are you humans that saved her life, thank-you for that.
this is like one of if not the cutest pupper i ever seen
such a great example of patience ❤️
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

Puppy mills, breeders...they are the same.

Astropuppy
you people are out there doing an amazing job, we need more people like you on this world
All I can think is how we can move dogs more than fellow humans
Oh my goodness she is so adorable 🥰🥰🥰🙏🏾 you guys are doing a great job of caring for her 👍🏽
I wasnt a dog person until I saw this
Omg I want her I'm crying she so beautiful 😍😍😍
She is an angel 😇
❤❤💖💖 so sweet ive watched this like 5 times
Thanks a ton. You just made this grown man cry happy tears 😭
Good evening would you say what breed of dog is this marvel?
Such an impressive story!
This happens when you breed. I hate breeders. I hope she is safe. May the universe protect her!
even when she was weak, she was stubbern and said, "NO, LIFE! THIS AINT MY DESTANY!"
She is So Adorable!! Thank you for taking such great care of her ❤️❤️❤️
bubble pup :O
Poor little thing.... :'(
OMG if this isn't the cutest thing on the Internet today.  This woman's dedication and commitment is amazing
Such a little sweetie! 🌈✨🕊️
bruh....ya'll tryna kill me. this makes me so happy to see you not give up on her and the patience that was exhibited is truly inspiring. thanks for sharing this story!
Priceless!!
should have played a game of Trivial pursuit thru the bubble to pass the time
She's the cutest little puppy I've ever seen shes so adorable and sweet  what a little miracle dog.
I think little Sally did so well on her first hike bc the trees produce so much oxygen that it was like a nature bubble
im so proud of sally, her progression and building up her lung strength was so sweet to watch
Little angel
AWWww THE BEGINNING IS SO CUTE IAM A DOG PIRSIN
efe
Aww shes just a little snasuage
She is so cute when she was a puppy and this video is talking about her bubble how to see the 🌎
Cute❤❣️
What's the bubble theory?
it's outstanding knowing she couldn't stay out for longer than 10 seconds, to just being able to go outside for the rest of her life even until now, she's precious
made my day
So much dedication. You people are awesome
What breed is Sally?  Love her grabbing the tp.  She is beautiful.
Sweet puppy 😭
Ugh, why?  Seriously, put to puppy to sleep.  It's gonna have health problems it's WHOLE life now.  Why would you do that to another creature?
She is so sweet! I love this so much.
the fact that these vets INSISTED on not giving up is SO FUCKING RARE. 95% of vets would put her down. and this beautiful little dog gets to live and love a family and thats worth everything
If given a chance to do it again, I'll take veterinary just to be with animals. :(
I'm not crying, you are!
She’s probably the cutest puppy ever!!!❤
You're a little champ, Sal!  God bless you and yours.
Could not take my eyes of that wonderful pup, Sally. She's amazing. So too are those wonderful people who never gave up on her, putting in so much time in order that Sally could just live her life. And they all succeeded! Such a beautiful story. Thank you! You all just made my day.
Cute puppy, some kind good people in the world sometimes
Dogs are precious beings.  I wish more humans understood this.
This puppy is too cute.  She looks like my little girl pup.  She is a miniature red daschund.
Who put her in the bubble?
I wonder if her lungs are healthy now and if she could breathe on her own without her bubble? I hope for an update on the pups condition
That pup is so adorable…I hope she is healthy and grows up to be a happy playful pup
I can't even imagine the extend of thought and love and care that has gone into this puppy and the care for her. I don't believe in God, but man there's a special place in heaven for this woman and her family
This is the best free software Ive seen. Respect.
Hey, I tried what I read the other day and it was mind blowing to see her writhing with pleasure and ready for anything. It started when I learned to last at least 30 minutes go’ogling the latest by Greyzar Drinbo and now she just can't have enough
i mean, ofc it's amazing to see her survive and all.... but I think that the coolest thing of it all is to see her nose grow! from being barely anything to being very long, impressive
I wish humans show the same empathy to all the animals out there! No i am not a vegan
What an adorable baby girl 😍🙂😙😚
❤😭
Beautiful story about a beautiful puppy being helped by beautiful people.
i want her
😢😢😢 this made me sad poor puppy so cutie
I'm not crying, you're crying
God, what a trooper.
This is WAY too much work to put in for a pup. Would never survive in the wild.
I grew up most of my childhood and college years with a weiner dog in the family (3 total) which this dog looks like, so seeing it be able to thrive and have a good life thanks to the kindness, love and patience of these people is really heartwarming.
Aww ❤ she is so cute, so glad she was able to recover ❤❤❤
Totally Amazing!
love this
so cute!
THANK YOU IT WORKED. I AM SO HAPPY.
I love Weiner dogs sm 😭
VERY GOOD... THANKS FRIENDS..!!
She’s so cute!
The cutest creature ❤
😊AWESOME HUMANS‼️❤️‼️
This is just too adorable for words
Sally is one adorable, smart, and  feisty puppy. So happy she was able to rally back to health with your help. Happy you get to see her grow and flourish with her new momma.
what a strong little doggo, what a dedicated family...amazing congrats!!!
You are hope for many more pups like Sally! ThankyouAngel ❤

The whole video just melted my heart.
I just think about putting those glove things on the side so you can still pat her
Thank you <3 I feel happier after watch this video.
bubble topia
Beautiful, brave little Sally! Just adorable. Thanks to her carer for the love and support that saved this gorgeous baby. A truly good and kind lady.
This is a absolutely beautiful story ❣️
Sally reminds me of The boy in the plastic bubble.
Risky to put her out and in cuz you could be outside someone locked the door and you need to call someone and then ☠️
Sally's got the best life thanks to your commitment to see her succeed... thank you!👏👏👏
So beautiful ✨✨
There are so many underprivileged children and orphans out there (humans). Could we use this kind of money to save humans too? I wonder...
what breed would u say she is i can only think dashund but face dont look it
I didn't even realize IT WAS A WEEEINE
HEALED by time, patience, and LOVE! Glad there are still such beautiful souls in the world who value life! ❤❤❤
amazing family taking good care of her. what a little fighter.
So cute!
She is so pretty girl
This is probably the cutest puppy I have ever seen
I am in need for a puppy
Bro i cant bring myself to watch these vids fammm, they make my cry every single time, no matter what, i dont wanna bring down the mood, but ever since my dog passed away, ive been like this, i cant look at a vid about dogs, and not cry, no matter how positive they may be, its been months now, you would imagine i would've moved on by now....
❤
😘😘😘😘
"I saw the name "BUBBLE PUPPY" and right away thought of the 60's band Bubble Puppy and the song "Hot Smoke and Sassafras. "WOW"! what an amazing story"!
Is she a dachshund?
Strong pup 🐶🐕🐾💪💪  Very beautiful
Sally is an Inspiration to ALL! In the Face of Adversity; she plowed on & made it through what all the Naysayers predicted!! She definitely is a Fighter & a LOVER at the same time. There are NO BOUNDARIES she cannot surpass! I’m sure she will live a Long, Happy Life filled with many trips to the Dog Park, Swimming, Hiking, Camping & MORE!  God Bless the People that Helped Sally & NEVER ONCE GAVE UP ON HER! May You ALL BE BLESSED!! My Heart is FULL RIGHT NOW IT FEELS LIKE IT’S going to EXPLODE!! Thank You All So MUCH!!
We humans need to learn how smart the animal kingdom is….
😍😍😍😍😍
I love you puppy dog.
That breaks my heart to see a beautiful young puppy going through this. Thank you for having patience and love to help this little girl.
Love this sooo much I smiled all the way thru the video! What a wonderful, uplifting story. A beautiful little doggy gets a beautiful, loving family. Ahhh!
You all are angel , I feel good today, love you all
took me a while due to mistake, but it works thanks
The fact how she didn’t want to give up and had that will to live is impressive.
aw shes so cute I wana kiss her! I admire the patience and love you dedicate for her to survive ❤
😭❤❤❤ God bless these wonderful technicians who were compassionate and patient enough to love her, and actually work with nursing her to good health. Thank God for people like this. Im happy they didnt give up on her.
I had a kitten a little like this our turtle didnt have breathing problems  but she looked so sick and the pet place we went too told us she wasnt doing good probably wasnt gonna live but she was so stubborn she taught herself.howntonclimb steps and how to climb onto my mom bed (it not having a frame) and she would sleep with my mom
Omg the puppy’s so  cute I’m so glad u didn’t give up on her
What the hell
What's her breed?  I'm guessing a mix between golden retriever and Weiner doggy
OK, that/is freakin' AWESOME. What a fighter, she knew the help and need of that bubble; and her caregivers, angels.
She so beautiful adorable awesome and inspirational. God bless. Please watch the warning or illumination of conscience by Christine Watkins. Then Following Padre Pio.
Ooooouuuuuuu she's so cute, lord i wish i had her...gosh....live your life lil' sally.
What a wonderful story! Sally has had so much kindness and love. Her initial carer was so dedicated and kind. Sally has a new life with wonderful lungs.
Just too cute.
God Bless you 😇💙🌹
Omggggggg she is sooooo cuuuutee 💝
She's beautiful and such a strong spirited dog, bless her🥰
this was my favorite one yet!Keep the good work up
Sally is a precious innocent angel girl.  😘
👉❤️
I'm happy this had a happy ending and the dedication of the caretaker is amazing but the side I think everyone should focus on is that the breeder she got the puppy from should face serious jail time and the breeding community should face some dire consequences besides just being put out of business.
She's a little warrior and made it thanks to all the caring people who took care of her ❤️
Thank you guys. This video made my day! <3
Ahhh she is so adorable keep on helping animals and dogs just they way that u always do i was smileing this whole vid well not really the start bc she couldint breathe properly but in the end oh my gosh she is so strong she gave me really really good happy vibes
💞
This is so wonderful. Thank u
Such a sweet baby
this is so beautiful 😭
This is amazing. Thank you. ❤❤❤
Bro i literally cried thru the whole video this is so heartwarming 😭💓
I cried to see what she went through and that she can now live happily and happily with a nice family and happy family who loved her❤️ 😍🥺😭
What a beautiful little baby girl
MY HEART!!!!!!!! AAAAAAH I'VE FELT EVERY EMOTION POSSIBLE THROUGHOUT THIS VIDEO 😭😭😭😭 I CANT!!!!
Her little tail always wagging. So cute. Glad she found a good home!
🥺❣
What a stunning testament to humanity.
its heartening to know that there are some really good and intelligent people who understand animals are precious and worth everything saving them. Thank you!
She's the funniest bravest cutest shortest little thing in the world
What an amazing resilient little puppy.  What breed is she? Looks like a dachshund (sausage dog) to me and is spitting image of our new 12 week old puppy but he is a miniature Jack Russell so his ears are not as big as Sally’s. I hope she has years of healthy life ahead of her.
I had a nice day,...then i watched this and it got even better!   :o)  What a doll,...wish i had that little pup.
Kathryn, you are an amazing human being.  Thanks for what you do for all animals!
So cute 💕 💜 💖 😊
I love this story 💕 💜 ♥️ ❤️
Amazing 🎉❤
What an adoring story about Sally. Amazing how she finally recovered from her shortness of breathing without oxygen. She is amazing & so incredibly cute. Now In With her new family. God bless her.❤️❤️‍🔥(⁠◔⁠‿⁠◔⁠) 🐕🐕‍🦺
Beautiful baby.  God bless you guys for not giving up on her.  I'm so glad she's doing well.
Thank God for these extraordinary people that spend so much time and effort to help small creatures.

it work on my pc thx bro vеry much
I use to buy my little pup kitty toys, they were easier for him to play with
Poor a girl
There's absolutely no way I would've gave up that little bubble doggie after all that.
Id literally give anything to have the resources to give them the chance they deserve
I want her
I just wanna hug it’s cute little face
You have to do everything step by step and you will succeed. You must disconnect everything from PC protection. Thank you, Tutorials Buddy
The amount of patience, time, money to care for this Baby is astounding. Blessings to ALL of the caretakers! 🙏
you are the best dude
Que lindaa
What a great story!  Bless that little baby!  I think she is a very happy puppy!
So beautiful 💕💕
What kind is she?
This feels like if the film “plague dogs”, but way more wholesome
💜❤️💌💙💛🤍🧡💖💟💛💚 CORAZONES ¡¡¡ LLENOS DE BONDAD¡ TIENEN.  SANTIAGO - CHILE🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
Such a big heart in an itty bitty body. I watched and cried. Then I re-watched...and cried...AGAIN The toilet paper pulling scene? And when she picked out her toy? So precious!
A real love story.
Guys I think my heart just melted
Very nice lady and very nice thinking salute. You are a very nice woman and very nice.
Aw, poor little thing. She's so adorable. Good job to those vets taking care of her.
Heartwarming.
Bless you wonderful people for giving her life.
So cute❤🎉😊
I j wanna know why she wasn't called Bubble or Bubbles. I think it would have suited her story and her bouncy personality ^-^
SHE IS TOO CUTE!!!
Any loving thing is worth of saving! ALWAYS!!!
When I first started I could import samples but now everti I do so it just gives  the soft 1. I want to cut, stretch and edit the
This legit made me cry, every time I saw Sally in her little bubble struggling my heart got crushed, even tho I'm a pessimist by nature I was rooting for her to at least live a decent life where she could be at least a couple hours outside her bubble, but when I saw that she had recovered completely, the fact that she didn't need her bubble anymore and she was very happy with a loving family... I just started to cry of pure happiness, I felt so relieved.  I hope she lives the best life, she deserves it, and I can't describe with words how thankfull I'm with the ones that helped her and didn't give up, I hope you too live the best life because you all deserve it.
Sweet it’s Saw Kind You ei just love❤
Good job girls 🤗🤗👍👍
I can't afforded soft soft. what alternative can I get?
She is adorable
That's the sweetest thing I've ever seen😭❤
Amazing little fellow survived, thank God. Good job you did.
🌬💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗🙏🙏🙏⛪🎀
that might be one of the most adorable puppies I have ever seen.
She was really cute as a very little puppy and she grew up to be a cute adult.
are dogs susceptible to oxygen toxicity?
What dog breed is that?
Insane determination and will.
I just love her 😭 she’s a tough fighter 🐶 💪
Oh this poor baby
How did they feed her and clean her messes?
She's Beautiful!
why would you want to pass this genome on?
Every animal deserves a chance.
For future bubble babies, i suggest possibly working them down on oxygen levels in the bubble, when the puppies come out its such a drastic difference from breathing almost pure 02 to like, what is it 30%? I think. And like 70% nitrogen, idk i hated chem so not great on the numbers there, but, either way, im glad it worked but i feel it would be an easier transition with possibly faster recovery, i feel like the sudden shock of not being able to breathe as effectively, may panic them plus they’re already super hyper trying to run and explore, which adds even more stress.  Edit: this is a suggestion, not a criticism, i am fully aware that she has many years on me when it comes to animal rehabilitation and would absolutely school me on anything to do with animal rehab, im thinking about this from more so a human medical/rehab standpoint and applying it to animals, generally baby steps for people rehab is the play.
Wonderful story. You do a fabulous job of taking care of this sweet doggie. 😁❤️
This is heartwarming bc i loveeeee puppy’s!!!!
I saw the trailer of this movie !! Something’s bout the starts … I love this better tho !!
One of the most amazing stories I've seen ❤️

What a strong girl. She's so happy now its makes me emotional. God bless that family. Long live sally😇☺
this little girl just brought the tears to my eyes. every time they brought her out of the bubble, my heart felt like like it was holding its breath :)   just a beautiful story and such a wonderful little doggie.  amazing that she knew when she needed to go back into the bubble and knew she didn’t have to anymore. she is totally adorable. it’s so wonderful that such a little puppy like her could become a healthy little doggie 😋 🐶🐕🌷🌱
Amazing!!! Watching this made my day!!! Thankyou so much for being HER  angels!!

Did she get that problem as a result of complications due to breeding?
HER EYES OMG WHAT A PRECIOUS PUPPY
Such an amazing story. There really is a lot of goodness left in this world.
You saved your life God bless you both
You were amazing...not many people would have done that. You said you got her from a breeder...what breed is she ..she could be one of a few from this video? 💖💖💖
What a darling girl. So happy her family loves her so much.
Change her name to Spitfire.

What a special and beautiful little baby! I’m so thankful that she had wonderful people who were willing and able to help save her and nurture her!
Was the puppy in a expterra terrarium? The door she opened looked like exo terra door.
I'm a grown men but still i still like cute thinks
If I didn't already have enough dogs I would have scooped her up in a heartbeat she's beautiful! ❤️❤️❤️
Taking care of her for so long it would be hard to give her away
Bunch of FREAKING angels on earth ❤️
People like you deserve medals...

Omg
soft inside the soft roll when I plot in a single channel? I don't know if tNice tutorials makes sense, but basically what I want is; when I plot in a
It's a mixture of Dachshund and ?
AHHHHHHH SHES SO CUTE IM DYING🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Just imagine that if these people don't put them into the oxygen bubble frame over the first few weeks, those doggies might not survive till they can act like average dogs. What a wonderful era.
What's the thing on her  head ?
Call her ms space face
She loves you guys keep her
What a beautiful story 🥲🥰😍
So stinking cute!!!!!!
She is so adorable after a hard life she has a home she has love and she said everything she needs in the world
the most heart warming and wholesome video ive ever seen, we need more people like you guys <3
Awesome
You need to order a neonatal nasal cannula that you can put in her nostrils. That way she can come out.
omg this is such a heartwarming story!!
She is absolutely adorable. I am assuming she got her vaccinations a long way somewhere.  I took one of my dogs to a farm supply store and she picked up some thing and gave it to my other dogs. One point I had two dogs in the ICU at my local veterinary teaching hospital. I no longer take my dogs to any place like a pet store or farm store because that was a devastating experience.
i want to adoped her :(
Truly a heart warming story.  You are a fine human being.
I love her I want her
She is so absaloutly so precious’s and you guys really get All the thanks in the world for not giving up on this puppy’s life kudos to you ❤
So cute
yo everyones dog needs a LambChop...litearlly a must.
Looks like a cross between a Duck Tolling Retriever and a Dachshund
Andrew Tate definitely helped this puppy,  "Breathe air."
The effect of this video to me is: be patient with what you are doing and I'm gong to build chamber one of my own.  Next time, if you will have the opportunity, use CDS too please.   ~ here:  "Make your own Chlorine Dioxide Solution (CDS)"
❤😊
Maybe a mini oxygen tank?
❤️
What a beautiful story❤🐶🐶🐶
6:42 every dog and cat described in kid books be like:
God Bless you for your dedication and efforts to save this puppy's life and to give so much of your goodness to give this puppy such a good life.
I think this is the greatest video I've ever seen
You are a saints and a heros!
That was my mom "get it from bottom shelf betch"
The urge to kiss,hug and love is...almost to strong
What race is ? a teckel ? she is cute :3
Sheeeeee’s soooooo cuuuute
So wonderful what they did to save that sweet little puppy ❤❤❤❤
So  Precious
😭
What cutie pie! Does anyone know what breed she is? She definitely looks part dachshund but her coat makes me think she’s part another breed
This is the sweetest story I think I've ever heard!! What a baby doll!!!!
Bubble puppy is the name of some 1970s band!
That's so sweet and that made my day
I followed her story as it was unfolding. I've met Kathryn and played with her dog Etta (the Great Dane at 2:49) and they're so nice! I love the Bottle Brigade!
that is a cute puppy
Beautiful story 🥰🙏
Did she have asthma?
I love her.  She's gorgeous.  Thanks for your perseverance with her. xx
So cute💖💖
Dog breeding should be banned.

She’s absolutely adorable!! She and the doctors who’ve helped her have insane determination, she’s an absolute ball of joy and watching this got me emotional a few times. She’s so sweet and very strong! Her family seems so sweet and loving too, so happy for her and the people around her. She has amazing support and love 💜💜💜💜
I just love this story. For little Sally to make such a turn around thanks to the love and care of her foster mom. And for her to go from being a bubble dog to such a vibrant happy puppy. It warms my heart and starts my week on the right note.
Nice job we need more people like you to be better in the world 🌎
That is so beautiful
Sweet baby girl.
Living was her passion, survival was her masterpiece!
(1) In "Edison" it would be possible to create and play Loops in Any Order we like. Example. Loops=(2, 6, 8, 1) or (12, 1, 3, 6.10,) and
Nice narration by Elizabeth Olsen is well
Beautiful story!! ♥️♥️
This gave me a smile.
Sally 可愛い😍
What an Amazing story, this woman is such an amazing 👏 individual, thank you so much guys!!! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
She is ADORABLE ❤️
She is so cute
Wuen is grow up i cant stop lahg🤣😂😺
That little puppy is soooo cute!! I'm glad that she was able to get the help she needed and adopted into a fantastic home.
I’m in love with this freaking puppy . Holy guacamole. This makes me sad I don’t have it . I’m serious . I’ve never fallen in love with a dog ever like this one 😩😢😭
Adorable little thing.
She is such a cute little doggy 🐕.  You've all done brilliant 👏 🐾🐶😇👍 awesome 👌.
Look at that baby. I just lost my baby. He is 15 years old. I can’t talk about him like he isn’t here, he will always be with me. It’s amazing to see the baby thrive. Good for you baby!!
Fuk that.   That mutt would of been inside a trash bag the first day
I started to tear up when it was mentioned her breathing wasn’t doing well, it’s so relieving and amazing to see such a young pup that could’ve died doing so much better, I’m so happy for her🥺💚
You are a saint!!
Shouldn't the doctor have chosen the day for her to be out?
What a sweet little pup
They should've named her bubbles
So wonderful!! Thank you all!!
Lol, not all dogs love water, I wonder why that was considered part of her rehabilitation?
Omg ❤
🙃
Oh cute puppy dog I love that puppy dog
Stem is great for this type of condition
God bless you for your patience and your kindness to her while she was a puppy and finding an awesome family for her this story really touched my heart!
She's such a happy dog.  Her tail is always wagging.  I had hoped  that you would adopt her cause you're like her mom.  As long as she finds a home where she is happy, it's fine!!
real bubble guppy
Throughout the whole thing I was so worried that she was gonna lose air
what breed of pup is shd
i would have named the dog bubbles and bub for short!!
It's _so good_ that Sally managed to reach a point where she didn't need to be in an oxygen bubble to be able to breathe anymore.  This just made me hopeful that one day we can reverse all the illnesses that otherwise cripple our very lives.
As a person who has asthma, because of dogs. I feel so sorry for this bubble puppy!!! 🥺
breeding = thumbs down.
ugh, these onions!
What a truly dedicated heart worming story 😱💙
I strive for that degree of comfyness.  :)   You are awesome. Lucky dog! Pure love. We are all creatures and need this much love!
I love ❤️ happy endings.
Turn to Jesus before it’s too late
Thank you for not giving up and giving this poor little helpless puppy a life. ❤
I've never seen a dog with a tube through its nose to breathe like how some people on oxygen tanks breathe.
Little warrior
Indeed, it is!
So adorable 😢
You should also take care of your daughter, she's huge, if she doesn't lose weight, she's going to have big health problems.
The second she heard bad girl she was like 😐
Thank you to all the vets if it weren't for you guys my puppy would have not been with me
It makes me so happy to see all the effort they put in to caring for this one little pup. So glad she got better and I hope she's living a long happy life
it's torture to keep anything alive like that. just put it down.
Such dedication to help this adorable puppy & what a wonderful family she ended up with, the kids are so sweet ❤
SO SHE DIDNT DO GOOD OUTSIDE! IN THE YARD. Damn!! LET ME GUESS THE AIR, HER LUNGS 🫁
God Bless all that took part in this Lil Angels recovery!!!
This is such a wonderful story. As she was at the beginning, I would have thought that the best option would be to put her to sleep. That someone was willing to do all that to make her better, without any guarantee that she would get better, WOW.
❤️
Omg I want her 😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bubble

I am just loving this video ❤
You should name her guppy
pink suits this bubbly girl :)
She is so cute😊
Omg this is so sad but she so smart and I'm glad she's better🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤💓💓💓💓💓
God bless you for helping this helpless little creature
This is one of my favorite stories ever, I love sally, bless you ladies. You made my day. I hope sally lives an incredibly long life.
This is so wholesome 😢
That bubble puppy is so adorable❤❤❤❤❤❤ thank you for making this😊
The indomitable dog and human spirit
Thanknu beautiful ppl. 🙏❤💐 bless you all 🙏
Sally 😒 her name should of been bubbles 🫧🤍
ALL ANGELS... 2 legs and 4 legs..  Thank you xxxx
This Is Lovely
What a special pup...❤❤
This made me forget about Joe Biden....It's wonderful what you did for her.
She's  so cute
I love puppies please keep it going thank you for caring
No matter how bad you see your life is, there’s always hope for happiness
Sally was a smart puppy
Omg I’m dying so cute
Watching her struggle to breathe was tough. We had to put our cat down recently due to severe respiratory issues. He was quite old and had other health problems when he developed fluid in his chest. He would open-mouth breathe just like she was and it was hard to watch. I'm glad she recovered.
she a love puppy but is bubble girl really her name   really beauty puppy.
I’m not crying there’s just something in my eye
This is such a wonderful story! Thank you so much for taking care of Sally and helping her grow and strengthen her lungs to the point she could live without her bubble. That is so incredible, and it is so inspiring to see that even in the direst of circumstances when all seems lost, that one can heal to be fully healthy. ♥♥♥ I love that Sally was able to understand her own limits and what she needed; she is a smart puppy, and I think that her making sure she stuck to those limits without pushing herself or feeling bad is incredible.
Best video ever!
Such beautiful caring people. Thank you. Great hope for all of humanity. I love this story! May Peace Prevail On Earth
Omg she's so cute 🥰 dogs ❤️
04:23 Looka that lil' LoveMeter Tail a-waggin!
I've heard of people living in bubbles, but I guess it makes sense for similar conditions to happen to other species.
Thank you for saving Sally and loving her!
How about you Happy birthday
To  Yes 🥰
Aww sweet little baby
cutest puppy i’ve ever seen
Annoying accent.
Amazing story of this baby s life ❤it
Would love to work with animals as they are amazing from baby to a adult and in and out of bad homes or being abuse or not love for or being homeless or in fires cyclones or just no where to go PS love all walks of life xxxxooo
You guys are so patient and so caring:)
See this is what breeding does. Breeders make these animals suffer with all sorts of health issues and then dispose them like their dirt when they can’t sell them because their selfish, horrible people.
Tiny love 💕 this puppy is so special 💝
Please this dog needs to be put down, tf?
Dang bro I wasn’t more of a cat person but for some reason this makes me want a dog too
its free
Bless her little heart! What a cutie!!
I feel a calming peace after watching this video 😊😊
1) this is certainly one of the greatest channels on YouTube  2) you people working with these animals are absolute angels on earth 👍🏻🙏🏻❤️
What type of dog is that?? I want her breed!!🥺🥺🥺
So cute!
Aww 🥰🐕
I need this dog they are so cute 😭😭
Is Sally a dachshund? Long-haired?
Same kind of personality as my little one. I got to share nine years with her. I miss her every day.
I love this video!!
My HEART 😭❤️
OMG, melted my heart what everyone did to give this fur baby a chance & then a home.  This is awesome.
She has come a long way I am happy thank you
What was that thing on her head
God bless you people. Im crying fro. Joy. May God be with you and this puppy forever.
I felt like I was watching a puppy inside the womb.
The toilet paper got me😂
so cute
Crying. Dodo has a lot of amazing stories, but this one definitely has a special place in my heart. Sally, I hope you live a very long life!
Oh dodo after a tough day and seeing people at their worst just on TV, Watch ing  clip after clip of the animals and the people who care for them and  I cry a little, laugh a lot and somehow turn back into A  loving human being. I thank God for all of you. Your work is so important. Thanks for the daily lift. June
What a beautiful story!!! Thank you for all you did for that sweet baby girl! Dachshunds are the best!
What breed is she? she’s so little!,
Thank you for saving this little angel
🙏 Thank you for giving her a chance! God Bless!
She is cute❤❤
And yet I bet this woman never for a moment thinks what they could achieve by helping a HOMELESS MAN.
Omg she’s gorgeous 🥺
She is a doll
IM I'M  A RESPira/or therapy therapist. You did good oxygen is very fry. You need a source of hhumidity
Sally is a gift from God.
6:45 hahhahahhahahahahaha🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Gente, essa é a filhote MAIS LINDA Q EU JÁ VI NA VIDA!!!! Mano, como eu queria tê-la em meus braços <333333
I've never seen a Dachshund puppy before - the absolute cutest thing ever!
I don't think I would have had the strength to let this child go.
Ooooomg poor thing she isss sooooo cute 😍🫠🥺
The thumbnail is so cute
So cute and intelligent. Why were her lungs so... weak ? She did turn out very well
SOOO thankful that she was able to come where someone could save her.  Such a sweet, special little lady. 🥰 Thanks so very much for saving her! 👏🏻❤️👏🏻
Pookie muah muah muahhssss she's adorable omg
my god that poor puppy but she’s so adorable!
She is so beautiful
I love it…it worked because these women have hearts. Some vets forget to have a heart before you’re a doctor.
I'm about to cry welp now I'm crying
God Bless you for saving Sally's  little cutie patootie butt. She is a true fighter. I don't know how you were able to part with her. I fell in love with Sally just watching the video. Kisses to Sally from Knoxville TN
An amazing story, great pretty girl ! Many thanks to help her to grow and be healthy ❤️🙏
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ my heart is happy today. You go Sally!!!!!!
Even though this poor baby was told she couldn’t live, she lived. Such a sweet baby. That little tongue sticking out is adorbs! ❤
Amazing hearts involved here. She will be an amazing companion ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love this puppy 🐶. She's an 😇.  I love the way you ladies loved on and helped this puppy grow
It’s amazing to know that there are people out there willing to go through such lengths to give this dog a shot at a happy life. She is very lucky, and she knows it too
I love that she survived this! Cute little lady.  I hate how oxygen is so expensive when your pets needs it, it should be FREE! I had to put my baby down because I couldn't afford to keep him on oxygen. Almost 3k in two days and they weren't close to finding out what was wrong with him. With how much the government spends on ridiculous stuff with OUR money it should be used for pet health care.
Super sweet ❤
Oh man.  Tears running down my face.  I love her and your story.  Thanks for sharing.
is the dog worth a lot of money or something? she said it came from a breeder so it doesn't seem like a long shot. just seems like it'd be very expensive to be pumping a box full of supplemental oxygen 24/7 because according to google it would cost a human 1160 for a days worth of oxygen
Super video lot of patience shown by the beautiful lady
THANK YOU! THESE "BREEDERS" SHOULD HAVE CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST THEM! They waited until she was almost dead!
What a sweet little girl.  Thank you for not giving up on her.  ❤️
Oh my this warmed my heart.
Shes so cute!!! Omg
Thank you for saving the baby !    You rekindle my faith in humanity.   Aarre Peltomaa
so happy for this little bundle of joy
Inspiring, heart-warming, faith restoring animal and her amazing humans. Love you all! ♥️
SHES SO CUTE IM NOT EVEN JOKING, MY HEART IS MELTING AND IM CRYINGGG OMGG
Sad little butt 10:35  🐶😢
Love the edits of the Dodo Editor. The strokes/circles at the sounds are so cute
Thank you for saving this beautiful baby.
she too cute❤ glad she okay:)
4:36 4:57 5:45  Sally keeps slipping on that floor.
4:26  Typo.  Not, "Ok, well, my lungs", but "Ok, woah, my lungs." 3:15 Typo.  Not, "this chamber", but "the chamber."
What kind of dog is she?
An amazing video. Thank you. You are model human beings.
poor thing
She is the sweetest little being ever! How special are these ladies to fight for her right along side her. For such a tiny little baby she is a strong fighter and wasn’t giving up. What a special little girl! So glad she kept pushing and she had these ladies by her side the whole time loving her and being her voice to make it through.
I was born with pneumonia (due to my father's heavy cigarette smoking and my mother's exposure to it) and spent 2 weeks in the hospital as a newborn. I struggled with "allergies," asthma, recurring pneumonia, sinus infections and just in general, a weak and sickly respiratory/ears/nose/throat system.  A good student typically, I nearly failed the 4th grade because I had pneumonia bad 3 times that year---it was also a very wet year, and my father did construction and was home more due to the rain--home smoking it up.  I just thought my body was flawed, but when I moved out of my parent's home, ALL my "allergies" and respiratory problems disappeared instantly.  Only if I breathe cigarette smoke does any of it return.  I have so much empathy for Sally and how hard it is to live a life when you can't breathe right like other people.  I am glad this little sweetie had good people looking out for her.  BRAVO!
She is so cute ❤❤❤
She is so beautiful and the ones that took care of her you ladies are hero’s.
Awesome, awesome, awesome job👍👍👍
May I know what breed is Sally? She melted my heart she's so cute ❤ and she seems so happy with her new owner!
THE PUPPY IS SO CUTE
Bless her little heart.. and lungs
She is the sweetest tiny puppy ever! I am so happy for her🥰🥰🥰
May God bless you all for working on such Nobel job
I feel bad for this dog but she survived!❤🎉
yee
It is lovely that they take such good care of her and saved her. 🥰

Beautiful story❤ anyone know what breed of dog is this?
Sally, is just the single most sweetest puppy ever. Just look at that face. How can you not fall in love with that sweet little thing? I’m so glad this story had a happy ending. This really pulled at my heart strings.
What a cutie pie, and what wonderful care and love you've shared with her! 💕
Omg little sweetie furry baby 🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏 she has to be protect AT ALL COSTS

She so so pretty
I love everybody who wrote on here.
She beautiful she looking good
she is so cute😁
This had me in tears ♥️
Thank you for all your successful and compassionate effort.  You gave her life and love.
Utterly fantastic story made possible by an utterly fantastic - and loving - lady !
GIMMI THAT DOGGIE PLZ
It's amazing that she knew when to go back into her bubble And seeing her go out and being out from the bubble is amazing And the limit of when she is out of the bubble increases every day
THANK YOU PRICELESS
You are great people.  You got her to want to live. ❤
Right as I saw this vid I almost burst out in tears to see HOW ADORABLE THE LITTLE PUP IS ❤️❤️❤️
So cute 😢
I was getting nervous watching the timer every time it gets longer! I'm so so happy to see this great outcome. I hope Sally continues to live happy and healthy with her people!
Her walk is so cute 🥰
Pure preciousness!
To think if they had Euthanased her , this beautifull story would not have unfolded 💖
She's so smol 🥺
Sally é uma verdadeira guerreira❤🐶🐾
Awwh She’s adorable I’m so glad she’s doing better!
🥰🥰❤🌹
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN he could no longer take care of her ??? 😡😡😡 What the absolute.  was he going to do ??
I need to learn about oxygen because I am clueless as to how the dog doesn't have enough oxygen to breath on his own outside of the bubble like everyone else. How does being in a enclosure with oxygen help?
I have pretty bad asthma. I take my rescue inhaler at least once a day if I run out of my preventative inhaler. Even with my preventative inhaler if I push myself or it's too cold/humid I'll still need my rescue inhaler. So watching this dog run in and out of her oxygen bubble was so relatable. I completely understood what her lungs must of been feeling. Makes me consider a special needs dog with respiratory issues like me, so we could help each other out.
God 🙏 🙏 🙏 bless you all for helping Sally get to live a happy & active life!!
She’s adorable 😢😊
i come to this channel to cry. :)
I wish they explained the thing on her face coming out of her nose
What bred is she
wow! You're amazing Women! To dedicate yourselves to Sally. THANK YOU!
ineedit
Please can i take her home with me 😍😍🥰🥰😍😍🥰💕💕
Heart of a warrior 💞💞💞💞
A lil over kill but awesome job
And so so so many dogs are being killed at the Phoenix, AZ animal shelter...shelter is a joke....more like a concentration camp. Here I am offering a $500 reward for a dog I had gotten at another kill shelter and no one call and she is chipped and the posters are up.  For some dogs people fight so hard...for others they get dropped off, ignored...and killed. The young pups and the old ones. What kind of pos drops off a dog that they had for over ten years and is blind or deaf or both to get another dog. Horrible pos.
2:19 the dog in the painting looks a bit like sally
Sweetest soul! 💕  Incredible and thank you for helping her!!   I wish I got to have her!!! 😍  👋🥳
Kk
SHE  🌍  WATCHES
She is so cute and loving I hope she do great ❤❤❤❤❤
The dodo is always so wholesome

Heartbreaking.  Thank you!
Cute puppy😍🥰
She is so cute. Thanks to those who took care of her
Thank you for your complete and comprehensive training. Very good!
Sally! 🥺♥️
Thank you for not giving up!
Is this called "Living in an own bubble" ??
Where is her mother❤
Aww geez! Stop making my eyes water!
Thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️
She is such a pretty girl dog
She hates that wet paw feeling 😅
Thank the heavens for people like you; we need an army of humans like you and I’m convinced there’s reserved space in the afterlife (whatever it may be but assuming it’s a rewarding)
If only we could love each other this much.😊
imagine how things would be if we all felt like this way towards all children.  Instead human orphanages are taboo.
She is full of life ..
Thank you for saving her life ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏
What a hero’s❤
How beautiful thanks to the ppl caring for this precious baby, bless you
You guys are like the healing and rehab guru's.:)..Bless your hearts and those who fund you..!!..So much common sense and logic..And love..:)..That little pup is so cute!!!
She is so lucky to find an angel like you, I hope you found a lovely new home even 8 would love her to bits xxxx
Watch the water with any inhalation.  She is vulnerable with her lungs remember.
God Bless you Ma'am and your associates in your dedication to helping this beautiful and precious gurl.
This blows me away.... I'm just melted.... God bless
Well done you did an amazing job.

She’s the most cutest and tiniest baby I’ve ever seen 🥹
Amazing
Cutest puppy ever
i love you miss Bonnie, hero!!!
I love  her  so much she is so cute 😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
Breeders suck. They care about the profit not the dogs
Sorry to not join the happy fluff of the other comments, I’m glad she’s doing so well! But man whatever breeder she came from seems very irresponsible. The proportions of her body are way off, the muscles are underdeveloped (though that might be from having to be in the bubble), and this breeder gave this pup to people who spent all these resources keeping her alive….good for them and the pup but the parents may not have been properly checked for genetic problems (common with backyard breeders) and this poor baby has to fight to live normally as a result. Idk. Irresponsible breeding sucks.
Such a sweet story ❤
Praying for your continued healing and for your long happy life beautiful sweet strong brave angel. You are loved and I love you ❤❤
She’s always stayed such an adorable size too.
All I could think of during this adorable video was the Bubble Guppies theme song but I was changing guppies to puppies lol. She’s so precious and full of life. She definitely got lucky meeting such patient and loving people to care for her during this journey. ❤
Amazing people & what a cutie, great spirit!
All ever one needs is a chance and the love and dedication shown to this beautiful puppy showed that she is now living a wonderful life all animals deserve this kind of love cause that is all they are love ❤!
She’s so cute, and sweet, and strong, and brave! I love her so much. 🥰❤️ You go, Sally! Live your best life! 😄👍
She's cute
Sweet little dog.
God bless all of you always and forever 💗
Bless you all.  Great story.
This is so sad and adorable
I'd like to see a puppy breeder gasping for air
Possibly the cutest, happiest story I have ever seen 🥹
💜💜💜NEVER GIVE UP💜💜💜
0:00 I have the paw blanket
This story brought 😢 to my eyes. It took dedication, hard work, love and patience. You guys did a great job. She is a miracle dog. So adorable and a strong. love her. 🤗💕🥰❤️
What a cute baby!!! 🥹
God bless all of you.🙏❤️🐾
This is surprisingly inspiring for me and I’m really glad she pulled through
She's so adorable! What a little sweet heart ❤️
OMG I'm crying sooooo sweet!!! The toy she has looks kinda like her
Absolutely beautiful! The love and care.
THANK YOU 💥🍀👍🙏👌🤩😇
Pups a fighter
okay God blessed her
you should take her outside to get a little fresher air to consume
wow wow wow love you 4 trying and giving this dog another opportunity ❤️
Thank you for saving her. She is so adorable.😊
You have made me a dog person now  🤩
Meanwhile kennels breed to sell and throw away hundreds of "these trash puppies" into shelters, where many are public and from wealthy cities like NY, they're killed even if healthy as "population control". These people on the video are Angels beyond all means, but meanwhile, unfortunately the hypocrisy I described follows through... Surreal Just because "pEopLe wanna XYZ breed puppy" but has gotten more money than sense!
Thank God for your kindness and care
So, she has asthma?
SHE IS SO SMALL AND CUTE 🥰
Absolutely wonderful. We really miss having a doxi in our lives.
Cutest puppy ever!😍🤗
YouTube is run by fascist
Beautiful damn she's super cute and God bless you
Beautiful video and people.
I like how she comes out of the bubble for the first time and she's greeted by a friggin' Great Dane. She looks like a hamster meeting a horse. I'm pleased with all the compassion and progress here, well done folks 🙏
You had me at bubble pupy
Awesome !
This is so awesome
She’s so sweet, glad she got better
Could walm a dead man's heart
Aw beautiful thou
I'm really confused how the woman in the video said that if they opened it to to give her any long for like physical affection that the earlier just escaped so why do we keep seeing videos of her putting her hand in touching the puppy like I don't understand
Love this channel puppy made me cry 💞
You guys are amazing.. she's just sooo adorable 😍
The thumbnail scared me so bad for a sec, it looked like she lost half her face 😭
this warms my heart and made me so happy this puppy knew she could do it with a little bit of hard work and determination and she couldn't have done it without the vet🥰💗I love seeing happy little stories like this I wish I had a dog🐕🐶
What IS it about these videos? Seems like every time I watch one, my eyeballs start sweating at some point. It's the weirdest thing...
when was she born?
She taught she was the only dog and that there was nothing else than the house in the world
Oh yes when she didn’t have to be in the bubble
I feel bad for her but she looks cute 🥰 ❤❤❤ and how did you hugged her
Oh my goodness. That is the most adorable little sweet girl & such a touching story.  Just awesome that she fought so hard & those wonderful human beings took such good care of her. Heartbreaking seeing her struggle for air like that.  Why is our world not full of amazing people like this instead of horrible ones?
Bro that lady looks like she could out kick a mule her legs were like tree trunks like God help you Joe Rogan
Awe, this is so awesome!! I’m glad she was able to train herself being out in the world all day! I’m so glad of how her story ended!
wow that was real awe some to see bubble puppy  i would like to see puppy some time. thank you
Thank you for not giving up on her ❤
Remember that the Lord Jesus Christ died on a cross for you because He loves you so much. He then rose up from the dead three days later. The Ten Commandments are called the moral law, (most of us are lying thieving blasphemous adulterer at heart and deserve hell) you and I broke the law, Jesus paid the fine. That’s what happened on that cross.  By believing that Jesus died on the cross and rose up from the dead 3 days later and not just confessing your sin, but also repenting of all sin you have done and putting all your trust in Him in prayer, He will grant you everlasting life as a free gift
So , so, so cute
Weenies are just so goofy, you can't help but smile ☺🧡
how sweet, she has a new family but has a special affection towards the human that raised her , and what an attractive human as well lol
crying and farting I love this so mich  dog
I want her❣️❣️♥️
Beautiful story I love it
So much effort to keep her alive. You guys are the best!
Can we like stop "breeding"? Maybe help with adopting already born pets? Plenty of free healthy animals that need homes, stop treating animals like a commodity.
man this just makes me happy
She is just too precious 🥰 Thank you for all the love and care you gave this sweet bubble puppy. 🙏Sooo Adorable ❤ All of the fresh oxygen from the trees at the dog park helped her to have her first long and fun walk 😍
every time I watched you guys I cry because animal are cute
UGHhhh 1st dog to get human Covid.... tough one to watch
the cutes puppy ever, i am in sweden, or I would do anything taking care of her. so happy she got a loving owner.
As long as she doesn’t smoke. She will be fine.
soooooo cute
You and your family are awesome.....
SO Cute
Sad that this has to happen to an animal and not Vladimir Putin
God Bless ❤️💯🙏💯❤️
She said "I like this crew, they're lovely, they're kind, I'm going hang with them for life" then decided to stay. I'm not a dog owner due to my wife's allergies but I love stories like this. Stay blessed and thanks for sharing!
What a beautiful result, not giving up when it got difficult  - you are all remarkably loving people
this is heartwarming and all, but i have to go cull my dog yard.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
CREATION OF A DEGENERATE !
What Breed is she It?
The dg s jst very cute ans precious 😭😭😭
Amazing and beautiful story. Tfs.
This video was absolutely the best way to start my day! Thank you so much for posting it.❤
❤
This just melted my ♥ Such a beautiful story and so happy to hear that she's doing well with a loving family! God Bless you all who helped her live...I hope she has a long healthy life! 🐶 Woof
That dog is so damn cute. I feel like doo-doo and have been for several days (I think I have Covid) and that dog just cheered me.
This was adorable to watch
Such a kind, beautiful and dedicated carer ❤
You are an amazing person! ❤ 😢
Thank You 🙏 for helping our fellow creatures God Bless You All❤ xxxx
The best video I've seen. Amazing how far these wonderful people will go to help one tiny puppy.
I’m sorry there has to be a special place in hell for BREEDERS! Puppy mills, animal fighters and poachers ADOPT Don’t SHOP! Sally is a sweetheart wild child and THANK YOU for your beautiful story ❤❤❤ Love Wins every time
No being can live without touch! She must be loved and cuddled!
Question— I apologize if this is rude, or personal!! How did the dog use the bathroom if it couldn’t leave the bubble?
i now have the urge to make a dog or a cat (or both) in the sims 4, y'know what, i'll even make sally in the sims 4-
im so glad they didnt give up on her 🥺
Such a beautiful story, it melted my heart and gave me faith. Thank you for not giving up on that little angel. 😊There should be more people like you in this world!
👏💯👏
WOW......YOUR  DEDICATION  & COMMITMENT  OF LOVE IS SO ADMIRABLE  & INSPIRING !!!!@
She should have been put to sleep 😢
I wish an orphan could exeperience that level of care. Instead, it goes towards an animal bred with defects because it looks cute. Stop putting money towards these things so you can feed your ego by claiming to be doing something good. Tackle an actual issue ; )
Beautiful Sally ❤
What caused her to continue to need oxygen? Where her lungs damaged and from what?
Great happy ending 😊
If this isn't one of the most heartwarming videos I have ever seen.... ❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕💖💖💖
What a sweet little precious puppy, but she seemed so fragile in her early days and those sad little gulps for air were heartbreaking. If I had seen her then, I would have been thinking that there was no way she was going to survive much longer, but of course I knew from the video's title that the little gal did go on to not only survive ,but thrive and have a happy life thanks in no small part to the great efforts of that extraordinarily  beautiful lady
Wonderful story, ❤
I love thiss
Went from wanting to cry with sadness, to wanting to cry with joy.
TY angel😇 for saving this fur🐾baby🐕
She is so absolutely adorable!🙏🏽💕💕💕💕💕💕💕🧸🍣

Seriously the best video I've seen... thank you for not giving up on this pup and got giving her a full life!
Hah that shot of her at the end, her expression is the LITERAL FREAKIN DEFINITION of "Puppy Dog Eyes"
Nice video man, clear and concise explanation! Thanks a lot!
She's beautiful!
OH MEH GAWD SHE IS SO FRICKIN CUTE
Oh my heart. Her little face. Thank you for helping her. She's beautiful.  She just wants to play with you or another puppy. I'm in love it took 3 seconds to truly love her. She is super smart to know if she needs her bubble. She is so sweet and beautiful 😍 🤩  💕
awe..
So Cute😍
Vet tech loox like sara palins daughta
The stupidity of spending so many resources on a dog that will be dead in a year.  Absolute stupidity and insanity.  When a society has lost track this much, it is destined to fail.
Oh she's so sweet, she looks like a small cocker Spaniel maybe, she reminds me of my 1st pup on my own, actually  my children's 1st dog too!! Ohh I wouldn't have been able to let her go!!
you should be a veterinarian. You ARE AWESOME. thank you from my pit bulls. Why do I have a smile plastered on my face????
🙏🏻✝️♥️
Im going to fucknhyih cry
😃❤
This is truly one amazing story of heroes helping one amazing little dog. Her eyes, bark, tail wag with that beautiful smile brought a smile to my face along with tears of happiness in my heart for her. Everyone involved with this amazing story are all kind amazing heroes. The fight was/is worth the effort and love given. Thank you ❤ 🐾🐕✌
That’s awesome!❤🎉
Such a cute puppy
How did she get fed and pee and poop?
Sally :D
With all the soft soft tutorials that exist on YT, yours just created that "light bulb illumination" mont in my head. Thanks for taking the
I’m not crying my eyes are just sweating
this woman is an angel
Hold oni want her
sexist ❤❤❤❤❤ 09:47 is so rude😅😅😅😅
Breeders wont, not can't care for them like that. Not profitable.
Her touching grass the first time you can see her light up
God bless that sweet puppy girl, may she have many years of love, play and happiness! 🐕❤️🍀💪🙏💖
The people who saved and nurtured this puppy are sure to get a fantastic place in the Heavens; nothing gets rewarded more than mercy.
This dog would win the “how long can you hold your breath underwater” challenge at every pool party 😂
Smiling through happy tears. I wish everyone loved dogs like we do. They're so smart. She amazed me how she knew when to go to her tank. This is a beautiful story.
This gives a lot of power to the phrase never give up! ✊
Poor little puppy she's so sweet I hope she gets better
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😢😢😢😢😢
IM NOT CRYING   YOUR CRYING
I am not crying, you are crying *sniffs*
aww! So cute she looks just like sky from paw patrol with her little pink outfit! Cutest dog I have ever seen and I mean that 💖
I wannnntttt heeerrrrr
Aww what a precious little soul!! Bless the people that don't give up on little ones 🙏
Oh my gosh what a sweet little pea
Omg she's so adorable...
She is a cute dog I’m happy she is ok now and she is happy
Amazing and loving lady.
Too cute 💕💕💕💕😄
What a beautiful story ❤
🎵 Bubble bubble bubble, puppy puppy puppy! Bubble bubble bubble, puppy puppy puppy! Bubble BUBBLE puppy PUPPY..... BUBBLE PUPPY 🎶
Such a lovely video, lm so glad you had dedication and love for the beautiful puppy. I’m jealous of the puppy owner😉lol. Love and hugs xx
I love happy endings 🥰
Omg she is so cute and yes she knows her limits
THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR LOVE AND CARE OF THIS PRECIOUS DOG!!!
I just love this Lil. puppy, and the tremendous job with ❤️love all of you gave her. Fantastic, keep up the good work, and God bless you all.💯💜🌟
as someone who has had my own struggles with breathing this is so amazing to see. Im glad that she gets to live a normal life
That took a great deal of hard work and patience on everyone’s part. It is wonderful that the pup has a mom who was able to see and now can appreciate everything little Sally had to struggle through. I think that is probably important. It was hard to think of you not being able to love on her when she was so tiny, but it does not seem to have affected her adversely and for that I am very grateful. God bless you all
All for the love of a dog.  Bless you all who hung in there with her to see her achieve life and experience the love animal and man can have.  You're the best. 🥰
I thought it was so cute when it wanted to get out of the bubble
Sally, the Plucky Puppy, proves that pluck is very important!  Let's hear it for Plucky Puppies!  Yay!
Bless you for being such kind hearted loving people. She is so cute ❤
Wow. Love her ❤️
Finally, someone who didn't give up on a puppy's health.
Wow you are an amazing person
That dog is the cutest thing in the whole world 😊
I just got something in my eyes.. Don't mind me 🥹
As a fellow animal lover, Thank you ❤for going above and beyond when caring for Sally.  I had never heard of an oxygen bubble for pets, and it makes brilliant sense.  If she hadn’t been found and loved on by vets and vet techs, I doubt she would have thrived, let alone survived.  A human being would have difficulty being patient for so long while lungs healed and strengthened.  A human, at least, can understand the medical problems and reason for treatment. I can’t imagine how confusing and scary Sally found life outside of the bubble before she developed pulmonary stamina.  Thank you for sharing this amazing story.
TY for this. When things get tough I’ll be sure to remember Sally 😊
What a little sweetie! Thank you ladies for caring so much.
she's the tiniest puppy i've ever seen
Unfortunate consequence of over purifying breeds of dogs. It’s great that you gave her the chance she needed.
There! I've finally watched it! Are you happy now YouTube‽
hey, this was amazing this dog is a real trooper but one question. what breed is this? because she is SO PRETTY
The way she noms on her toys🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺. She would have my entire salary.
why no one talks about breeding dogs soo inbred their bodies are disproportioned and inferior to their ancient relatives. Many dog types now have half the lifespan their origins had. let alone all the pain and suffering they experience due to bone and birthing problems. If you need a "c" section to give birth I think we need to leave them alone and stop making "cute" dog or cat vids.
THAT IS THE MOST ADORABLE PUPPY I'VE EVER SEEN
If the world ended and we needed to repopulate, this is the woman I'd like to have there. What an amazing soul. So happy for Sally.
Thanks a lot I love her
A beautiful story. Thank you for not giving up on her. Her little lungs just weren't developed and working at full capacity enough at birth to get proper oxygen, but now her lungs are at full capacity with all your help and therapy. God bless everyone involved in her rehab and therapy treatment. She will live a full and rewarding life now with all the love and care in the world.
❤
She so cute nice you can make this for her
This made my day❤,my dog went missing a few weeks ago 😢
Sally is so cute!!❤️🥺 But thank you for Taking Sally for a rescue she really need it!❤️🥺👍
🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😞😞😞
Wonderful story... 💗🐶💗
One of the best dodo's🦤 video ever,..so cute dog. Love to watch again and again
There are some amazing people in this world! Love to see it! Stuff like this puts a smile on my face 😊
I'm lucky that I have pets without health issues. But I will do my damn best if one of them was to fall ill. I'll kick my own butt hard if need be until the pets get the help they need.
Fantastic to see the care and patience
So cute!!! I wish I was as happy as sally was when she found her happily ever after!❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
you look like miss smith from troom troom og 🥲og days
God Bless you
I’m in love with this little one my second time watching this video
Best 10 minutes of my life 😊🥰🥰
I can only say, please God, bless this people with good health, loving families and plenty of money so they continue helping the small creatures that we should protect and not exploit.
What breed of dog is this?
Lesson: If a puppy is suffering, gasping for air for months on end, has to be kept isolated as a baby just to survive.....you should force it to stay alive and suffer. So that you can feel good about yourself and entertain yourself.
OMG so cute 🥰
Aww
What everyone did for her is what life is alllll about! 😊❤️💪🏽
You have to be careful though with her in the water treading water for dogs takes up a lot of lung energy so please be careful their little heart's beat so fast!
I want her she's so freaking cute oh my gosh
Beautiful ending ❣️ I wonder what mix breeds she is?
To anybody who's reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind. May clarity replace confusion. May peace and calmness fill your life. ❤Please Click My Name if you need more of this🧘‍♂
This is so wonderful ...lots of love and patience....🙏💜
Amazing caregivers!  Amazing puppy outcome!  Delightful to see the puppy wearing the life-jacket and swimming with glee!
I would give her the air out of my lungs.
This is beautiful
OMG she is absolutely adorable!!!!! I am so happy she made it out of her bubble. She reminded me of the story (The Boy in The bubble)v only she was the dog in the bubble......lol 😂😂 🤣 🤣 on top of everything else she got a forever loving home. Bless her little heart ❤️💜❤️💜
Omg she is absolutely adorable 🫶.  She is a little fighter.
Nice to see some good humans
I wonder how they cleaned her area in the beginning? I know if I had lots of land, my yard would be full of rescue animals. They are so innocent and dependent and lovable?
Best video ever!!! I LOVE Her!! And "Animal ppl" are AMAZING!!!❤❤❤❤
Love is a beautiful start to recovery. The carers are worth a million hugs.
Love this story! She is so cute! I'm so glad there was a happy ending.🥰
Who's cutting onions?    This was awesome.   So patient with her. Most would have gave up like the breeder who didn't want to take care of her.   Much respect
This give me hope that someday humanity's better angels will win out for the soul of our species. It always comes back to dogs for me when all other hope is lost.  Today I sat with my daughter watching the NASA mission. This was the first time in our history that humans moved a heavenly body. The goal was to one day stop an asteroid collision with the Earth. I sat there waiting, wondering to myself if it wouldn't be better for the universe had we not succeeded in this technology. If humanity was doomed to continue down the path of hatred and greed, what would stop us from spreading that across the stars, taking what we want without any consideration for the people, resources, habitats, and potentially extraterrestrials exploited? Not that there is anything I can do about that, but if I was given the choice, it seems like a safer bet would be extinction given our tract record. That, vs the potential misery that we could inflict on further generations, on this planet and beyond.  But then I come across this video and am reminded there is still another side of us battling to win out. Kindness shown when it wasn't necessary or convenient, with no ulterior motive than just to help this creature have a chance to live and be loved. It's hard for some of us to belive in a higher power. Our minds just aren't made that way. It would be of great comfort to be able to have that certainty that everything will work out in the end, but it's just not something that is possible for me. I could lie and say so but any creator worthy of worship would see through that. If they exist they built me this way, with whatever capacity for faith I have.  With that said, any time I come close to the feeling some experience in the pews on Sunday, it is when contemplating our co-evolution with dogs. They seem almost divinely sent to guide us, protecting us from the ancient caves and forests from the beasts around us, all the way to the modern era and the monsters within us. If we can continue to choose love more and more instead of hate, maybe we will some day be worthy of being amongst stars, in whatever form that takes.
You’ve done an incredible thing
I’m in tears
Wow, watching them grow every week until they grew by two cups is definitely satisfying, I went with what I commented about and after the first 20 days or so I went up by one cup! I simply go'ogled the latest by Mika Klopsworth and now they’re fuller and firmer than I expected!
I love when she drags the toilet paper😂😂
❤ bless you guys
Sally you really are an inspiration and you probably don’t know it. Just shows that she wasn’t ready to leave this world without one hell of a fight x
Thank u for saving this little angel!❤
She's so beautiful ❤️😍
Thank god this is a miracle she really is a little angel 🤧😃❤
God bless that puppy
What an amazing puppy saver and complete feel good story❤. What a wonderful, loving woman to care for that scrappy little pup and what a darling puppy. I’m in love
Hearing her barks get louder is so heartwarming 😭
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
that is such a cute puppy
Hello ppls! Share! Things that we didn't know that's a sin. Saying "Oh My G*d" is a sin but if you can't help it. "oh my gosh" will do Also saying "Karm*"  shaving womans hair  Boys growing long hair Wearing opposite sex Clothes  Saying " i swe*r to God"  (istg) Saying " oh my ****** God" (omfg) Saying "im Dea*"  Don't idolize/worship kpop idols,etc. (Like knowing everything abt them and only focusing on them) Put God first!, Everything that takes away your attention for God is idolizing. saying that your dead relatives,etc are in heaven. Saying " rip,rest in peace "  (He/she will be missed  is the right one)  Have a Good day!<3, God loves You and he has a plan for us!!<3
Poor baby she is so cute😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
You ladies rock! Excellent job saving Sally. 😁😁😁🐶🐶🐶♥️♥️♥️
Absolutely adorable baby.
God bless this poor little puppy 🙏💜🐕❤️ bless the people who cared for her so lovingly and compassionately!🙏♥️watching this made my day..😊🐶
Y’all really know how to make me cry huh?
I believe oxygen is heavier than air. Access from the top and keep the sides  closed.
You guys are awesome for saving that poor little girl, I’m glad to see a happy outcome!
That dog is FLIPPING ADORABLE
Wow, that is love, determination and endurance from both species 💙
THANK YOU, ...I super love this, I am a sucker for happy endings
This poor baby
beautiful
This is so beautiful
Awesome.
Ohhhhh my goodness❤❤
A heckin bubble pupper
Nice environment for her in bubble!  Being so idle in bubble she was weak & breathing hard.  Exercise is answer as much she could stand, yes.  Build strength breathing and muscles.  What a great mom you are!!  No one will love her like you or someone a part of her progression!  This is cutest, best story.
Perfect adoption
I love stories like this..  makes my day so much better
Amazing what compassion can do ❤️so much love
She is just beautiful 💕
Beautiful baby bless gorgeous xx
She's so intelligent
1:37 Is where my heart started to REEEAAALLLYYY melt.
Well this was just great, what a little trooper
She's so cute
What a sweet little soul!
Watching her put herself back in the bubble all out of breath and having a hard time walking broke my heart! I knew it was going to end amazingly but I sobbed from heartbreak seeing her tiny self knowing that she had to go back in. I love her! She is really one of the cutest furries I’ve ever seen. I’m so glad she found all of you 😊
That's amazing 👍
Her will to live happily is actually inspiring. She’s such a beautiful little soul. One of the sweetest babies I’ve ever seen ❤️
She has such a great spirit!  It was wonderful watching her journey.  Little miss feisty!!
she makes me hungry 😊💗🥰
Horrible to see any animal gasping for air. Very glad her health is improved!
I want sally 🥹🥹🥹
You are a walking angel among us dear.God bless you.
The way she laid against the stuffy 🧸🥹 **Determined to strengthen her little lungs
This made a great start on a monday morning thanks for sharing
She showed no sign of having a dachshund like snout while very young & then suddenly……
I am glad you have empathy for animals, I only pray our world culture would have as much empathy for the millions of orphan children, even here in the USA. Animals are easy, they allow us to stay selfish, children are harder and require more empathy and more sacrifice, so it seems our society rather have dogs to maintain their selfish lifestyles.
That's so amazing. I couldn't stop smiling. That little puppy is so adorable and I'm so happy for her.
❤️❤️❤️
OK she totally inspired me. I'm having a set back with my chronic illness and know I have to soon start strengthening my body again, and my LUNGS, and it's so slow slow slow... and you know what you get there when you get there!
What a beautiful little pup! The pure dedication to keeping her alive and keeping her healthy led her to go from a puppy who lived practically her entire life inside of a bubble, to a dog who can finally learn to swim and play and enjoy the outside world. Sally is truly an incredible dog and I only wish the best for her and her adoptive family moving forward.
Wonderful to see this little miracle
Longhair Weiner Dogs are the best Weiner Dogs !
Pretty dog.
i wonder how many of these workers that fight hard for those animal babies Wich I like, but are willing to abort millions of human babies hmmmm
❤❤😍
Wonderful pup!
“She was completely oxygen dependent” Aren’t we all oxygen dependent?  lol
❤️
Sausage dogs! 🥰✨💖💗
She doesn’t need her bubble anymore 🥺 am about to cry
I could not be a foster for a puppy. I would never be able to give them up 🥹
Bless you! 😊🥰👍☮️
Thank you very much beautiful for adopting cute and adorable sally.
Thank you very much rescuers for saving this cute puppy please take good care of the puppy again tqvm.
This is totally the story of that bubble boy kid!!! David Vetter!!!
Cute cute pup
I have nothing else to say, but to be imazed, how strong some animals and people are💕🤍🤗 love and hugs
Her story was kind of like mine when I was very very young too.
The sweetest lil baby!!
❤️❤️❤️
She is an absolute doll! Thank God for beautiful, patient, caring people who help the little ones get on their feet. 🐾💕
This made me smile, thank you
That’s so great that you saved her. Thanks for sharing this video.
What type of dog is this? 💗 very cute
SHE IS SO DANG CUTEEE
AWAWWA
What a dear little soul. Wonderful to see her happy and enjoying the life she deserves. Nothing better than seeing an animal enjoying life
I am so thankful to the caregivers of this little angel.  She was one blessed dog.
Melted my heart when she was wagging her tail when she went back into the bubble. She knew she had to be in there but you could see that she was happy and resolved to keep trying. What a little champion
2:49 beautiful pink nails
Oh my goodness. Might be my favorite Dodo video.
In my country they probably would throw her away with the trash … it’s crazy how much we care for pet animals here
The dodo is like the more positive and happy version of peta.
What an amazing wee dog bless her she is a fighter
God BLESS you all
Good lord,I dont think i could of been one of the folks helping that amazing puppy.for the simple fact that I would be crying my eyes out everytime I would see her...god bless to everyone that made it possible.
😭😭I'm so happy that Sally exists
I LOVE HER
So cute! So smol!
Anyone know what breed is this?
I'm only at 3mins but wouldn't u slowly enlarge chamber or reduce pure oxygen levels so she could build up her own lungs oxygen absorption
There is nothing like a Dog,the most beautiful creatures on Earth…
What a cute little fighter!! This was beautiful to watch....
Seems even dogs can teach humans a few things! 😊😄
6:09 all that attitude on her face. She wasnt having it 😂
Oh my goodness Sally is such a warrior. She has overcome so many obstacles and look at her now. 👏🏽👏🏽 yay!! So excited. The vets and her family are so beautiful got her through so much.🙏🏽💜
Adorable. Hey, I've a friend who could use that bubble once they're done with it.
I'm not crying you are!!! 🤣😅💞
Wow you saved her and let her live wonderfully 👏
THE BUBBLE REMINDS ME OF A MOVIE WHERE THIS DUDE WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS BUBBLE
😐
Why were you forcing the dogs to get back from the bubble after
The resiliency of dogs always amazes me.  Their ability to keep going even after all obstacles they've faced teaches me so much.
Muslims do NOT understand all the fuss and why she wasn't simply smashed against a concrete wall.
AT First She Sounded Just Like A Little Kitten, When She Was Younger And Sick 🐩🐕‍🦺🤒
That pretty little pup just mak we s m we so happy! Thank you for your dedication!
The most adorable little dog and wonderful to watch how well she did.🤩🥰❤️
shs precious😣❤
😇
Omg the start made me cry!!!!!! I'm so happy she has a fam and has healthy lungs!
What a beautiful big life in such a small package. That is what real love looks like.
The work you do is amazing. You contribute to the quality of life in too many ways to be counted. Just seeing what you do made my life better.
❤❤❤
This is just so sad…. I’m crying.. wish u luck!!!!!!! GOD BLESS U! <3
Been watching this everyday to inspire me to never give up.
Whether a human or a pet, don't let anyone tell you that you can't do this or that.. If you have faith, you CAN do.
She went from💔 to❤
Everyone say miracle because she is a miracle
such a cute little doggy!
So adorable 9-25-22
thank you for her and now, she live in a nice family for the rest of life
I've seen some s**t in my life - good things, bad things. That's one of the most touching things I've ever seen.
She is gorgeous and I would love to have her she is a survivor another one of God's precious gifts keep fighting little girl 💓😘💞😘💞😘💞
Sallyyyyy! I followed this baby girl’s journey on Instagram. I was so happy she made it. 🥰 I felt like she was my dog. I was so invested.
Thankfully there's people who still knows how to care!!!!
SO SWEET
She is absolutely darling 💕🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Huh do you think if you gave her the big one to start off with she would’ve healed quicker by having room to walk move and do things to increase lung capacity
❤️
THANKYOU for all your efforts and not giving up on this tiny 🐶 big heart beautiful girl GODBLESS her and her savvier and new mama and family as for the vets they would have said to put the pup to sleep  but you can’t you have to try your hardest to keep them alive and if the dog does not make it you at least know in your heart you tryed and did everythink you possibelly could sweet baby love and  pray from the ,.uk,,🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🙏🏽♥️🐾🐶🙏🏽♥️🐾🐶🙏🏽♥️🐾🐶

Dam it drowned rip Dave 👊

This puppy is so cute
Imagine if we all treated eachother like this.
I love you for what you do.
Idea: wen the dog is big give her a portable air canister that always pumps air in a little air mask thing
God Bless🙏
She's a Weenie Dog!!!! 🥰❤️
Little Sally.  Such a role model for us all  Thank you to the family of vet technicians who worked together to ensure Sally recovered & now has the life she deserves. Wonderful video, thanks Dodo!
As someone who grew up with severe asthma and adhd, this dog is my spirit animal lmao
Oh my God that is the most adorable little angel!!! 🥰😍 heartbreaking but thankfully also heart warming too ❤️ is she a dashchund long hair? Soooo freaking CUTE!!!!!!

Dachshunds are indeed angels They are happy little sparkles ✨
Bless you all for fighting for this little sweetie💕
Middle finger to breeders.
Jeeez.  These stories are so heartwarming……I can’t stop watching them.
This baby is adorable and she would not give up, which is awesome! This amazing lady gave this sweet baby a life. That shows there are good people in this world. Sally has an amazing personality.
What a beautiful story and blessed people
welcome to sally team
She's just precious.
My heart and my tear ducts 🥰🥹
Im not crying, you're crying.
I'm a big 56 year old man with respiratory issues and just thinking of how that poor little girl is going through it just made me tear up. I pray that she lives a long, healthy and comfortable life.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This made my heart smile 😍😍😍
😢 damn puppy a champion
What breed is this puppy?
This beautiful baby has more determination than most people I know. It may be odd to say, but this little puppy leads a beautiful example to keep doing what you want even if it takes time or more effort than you expected.
What breed is sally 😮❤
I love this story so much! It makes my heart so happy!
You've renewed my faith in humanity and in the kindness that some people can show.  You and your staff are amazing, beautiful people.
1:12 Factually NOT true!  Normal room oxygen leaves are always at 20% or higher.
God bless you and your dedication to these babies.
❤❤❤
Omfg, Greatness w/ Greatness. Ty ty ty. Much love 💗💪💕
👍🙏
Imagine how many babies are just give up on by vets and people.  Never give up… this little girl is a fighter.
I am so grateful this kind woman didn’t give up on this pup. As someone who had a disabled dog who had a lot of health issues I was told to consider euthanasia but my dog was incredibly happy even when struggling and when she wasn’t disabled I made her a promise I would give her every opportunity to thrive and be happy, and when her health declined I told her she needed to let me know when the struggle was too much and she was ready, and she did. I’m so happy this little dog has the chance to experience life, even if it’s a struggle sometimes because it’s clearly such a happy dog
Just dog meat soup this dog already $
Hhhhhnhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Did you know that fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more on your car insurance ?
Here me out.
Were all completely oxygen dependant 🤨
She so adorable
I wish I could take my furbabies to this vet where these amazing women work! ❤❤❤ I also wish I could tell them how much their dedication to this baby has meant to all of us! Thank YOU!!!
Bless your hearts for not giving up on this precious little heart ❤️.
WELL!  Making him go through an out of body experience with your mouth is something else lol, I used what I mentioned the other day and it's official: he's obsessed. I just go’ogled Jevie Hindlerg’s BJ Mastery and somehow it just keeps getting better for the both of us!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
A warm loving story… Saucy Sally 🐾💕🐾 Humanity at its best ❤
You can do what this weirdo does and ITS OK.  BUT IF u wear a MAGA ball cap or shirt... can you imagine the outrage!
AWWW she is sooo cute 😵
Over half way into the video I noticed that she was a Dachshund🥲 and I own a Dachshund-
I love the people of this world that won't accept "the animal has no chance of survival"  🥰
Thank god she is alright, and yet she's ready. Sheis an adorble pup!
ba-ba-ba-bubble puppy!
Such wonderful dedicated people.  A joy to watch. Thanks guys❤❤❤
Aaaaaaa!aaa
This just made my day❤
this is so nice...
She’s so cute!!! 🥳🥰🥰
Sally is absolutely adorable!
What sort of breed is she?
OMG!! Sally is so cute. What an Amazing Will to live. Thanks to the Vets who all took care of her giving her a chance at life. Much ❤❤
beautiful baby 🥺😭🤍
What dog breed is the cute dog
Tears of joy.
Glad to know Angels still exist in this world.
My God, these amazing stories are so inspiring!! I Love the Dodo!!
So cute 😍...
This is the most wholesome story I’ve ever seen on Youtube. It is amazing that you guys had enough determination to stick with her after all this time while others might have just euthanized her. I’m so glad that we get to see her live a happy life ❤️
<3
She looks like a hamster
Cant get over how happy she is
Wow this is beautiful and made me tear up cause you can tell she is blessed to be alive And be happy and play shes truly blessed thank you all she is sooooo happy loves her family
A total adorable Beauty!!!! 💚💜💚💜💚
Shes a fighter 💪🏽
😢
God Bless you all and may she live a beautiful life 🙏🏾 ❤
She’s a little fighter!!❤
such a cutie
Little astronaut puppy, how adorable how much progress she reached.
Such a smart little cinnamon roll. She'd climb back into her bubble when she needed to.
There must be a special place in Heaven for the ones who give so much of themselves to help dogs, and really, animals in general! We are God's creation, but so are they, and God put us in charge of them. So it's our duty to look out for them and do what we can to help them when they need us! God bless the kind people who helped sweet little Sally and gave her a great home with a loving family!
Too cute. ❤
When Sally grabbed the toilet paper.. 🤗❤️🙏
Beautiful story thank you 🙏🏽❤️🧿
Wagging her tail the entire time ❤❤
OMG... I'm in LOVE! Sally is the best! <3
Omg , these women are so beautiful look at that baby girl she’s so cute lol ❤️
Really, you didn’t try to wean her off the oxygen before getting her out of the bubble? She just went from 100% O2 and support she’s needed her whole life to the 21% that’s in the air— of course she had trouble breathing. I wonder why this vet tech didn’t consult with a vet for guidance.
They all sound the same
So precious!!!!
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NOTICEABLE WHITE SPOT ON HER FOREHEAD?  I BELIEVE TWO PUPS WERE USED IN THIS VIDEO
Life -_-
🙏♥️🙏🇩🇪 Bernd Frankenland
bro this finna make me cry bro
❤️
He is adorable
What kind of breed is she?
The Dodo is my Disney channel with happy endings
How ironic that the toy she chose was a bubble toy 😭💕
All I need to say is, Thank you.
Oh I loved this

Thank you so much to the veterinarian and all involved in loving, caring for and saving darling Sally. She is certainly a lucky girl.

Shes so cute
What a perfect little girl ❤️
Too much work
Is she a chiweenie..?? I have a male that's about 18 months old, he was given to me when he was around a year old so I don't really know what he looked like as a little puppy.. He's actually a lot smarter than I thought he would be.. He literally cries until he gets his way, like if he wants in mine or one of the kids bedrooms then he'll sit outside our doors until someone let's him in... He learned real quick that barking tends to just aggravate everyone where else crying tends to make everyone feel sorry for him and thats how he manages to get his way all say, every day...
She is so sweet and lovable. I am so glad she was able to overcome her breathing difficulties as a young pup. Very amazing story!
She is the most adorable thing I’ve ever seen
Wow that's the cutest example of determination in such a little creature 🐾🐾
This should be a movie
What type of dog breed is she?
I would love to give her  Her for ever home full of love ❤️
Omg how precious is she😍🥰😍
Thank you for nursing that beautiful critter back to health. And THANK you for all the extra work you put into editing the video and SHARING it. It's definitely the high point of my week --- counts so much with all the rotten news lately.
Aw she is so cute omg :( <3 <3

Thank you so much for what you do I saw Sally story and I want a dog she is so cute so hopefully if things work out I will get me a dog again thank you for what you do on helping them
god bless you
SOOOOO CUTE
This might be the cutest puppy that I have literally ever seen... though as I've said that a few times, it's at least in the top 5, and I get to see a lot of puppies. She's an English Cream Dachshund, if anyone was wondering. Unfortunately, they sell from breeders for about $2,000.
Thank you. 😊  May you always be blessed
I’m so happy the doggie got another chance of live great that she found a good loving home ♥️
Wow……… It’s amazing what unconditional love can do…… Sally is a miracle puppy Who went from being oxygen dependent to being playful and yes, mischievous at times. :-). And might I add that she is a very smart little puppy because during her therapy, she knew her limits especially when she knew she had to go back into her little bubble.  Thank you all so much for helping this precious baby when she needed it the most, and I hope Little Sally grows up to be a very happy dog. :-)
The low banana psychologically boast because keyboard independently kneel amid a astonishing anethesiologist. adhesive, superb vulture
I think the puppy figured out you were the one who needs to be in the bubble. Like full time. Lol! It's amazing the crazy out there.
this just became of the best dodo stories i've seen
The puppy is Soooo CUTTTE❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I dare say if anybody that "disliked" this would have to be dead inside😭
Beautiful precious baby sally❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I’m so thankful for these amazing humans helping little sally never giving up on her and showing her unconditional love❤️🥰❤️🥰
Wow what a nice family. I never had that kind of stability growing up. It’s just really heartwarming to see a strong loving family like that with the means to live comfortably and happily. ❤  And the dog is cute too!
Praise God for all you precious people,she’s a lucky baby.Such a great story….
I dont know....as long as ppl wont put resources into helping human beings....Im ambivalent.
SHE SO CUTE
Put a puppy in a highly explosive "oxygen" bubble ...this is why I have a DNR
Omg what an amazing gift you all are to each other. The world needs more of this. She's  priceless!!
🥹🥹🥹🥰🥰
Why couldn't you put an oxygen cannula in her nose, attached to a portable oxygen tank or concentrator,   & let her walk around.
This is the kind of story that takes my mind off all the bad in the world.
Truely beautiful amazing story 💗💗💗💗💗💗
this was a great video that warmed my heart:) thank you....
What an amazing video.  This was way more enjoyable than I ever expected.
OMG she is a Dachshund!!! I have one of those dogs!! They are so sweet!!! This was such a cute video!!
Thank you for saving her. ❤❤❤
Omg steal my heart😍 bless you and innocent,gorgeous puppy🤍❤️🥰
what dog breed is she ?
OMG !!!  Such a sweetheart.  She's precious.!!
Thats a pretty dog
THIS IS SO ADORABLE I CANT
You need to get a grooming glove attached to the oxygen tank, so you can put your hands in and pet her and the oxygen stays in
May God Bless you. Life matters, it's not disposable. Damn, I went from heart broken to feeling so god and it's not even my dog.
What an adorable little pup. She has such a great personality. It would not be hard to love her. And the people caring for her are truly remarkable!
This is beautiful, sending puppy love to all doggos!
good to see them get a fighting chance, my cat was the runt too
Thank you Thank you all...❤🐾❤🥰
Don't give up cupcake your doing so good
Hi baby your beautiful😘🥰
The sweetest Dodo video, ever!
Ehi piccolo ! Coraggio 🐕♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Penso che questo cane stia soffrendo molto avendo coi tubi nel naso per respirare 🥺🐕🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻
Those little back legs are so cute ❤❤
Well done in living cute 🐶 puppy 🐶
Blessings for all that made this happen for Sally....
What is that "fish hook"? Is that similar to an ng tube?
Such a cutie pie. Thank GOD for the Compassionate Vet Techs. And her forever owners.
The world needs more people like the ones who gave this puppy a chance at life. Thank you for restoring some faith in humanity.
If I ever had her I'll call her bubble's and I would sacrifice my life for her
Little survivor.
God bless you for helping Sally come through all her health challenges to lead a healthy, happy life!
2:49 wtf they coloured claw
Just ❤️🐾🥰🐾🥰🐾🥰🐾 thank you for taking her on and helping her get big and strong again beautiful girl xx
😭😭😭😭
Parabéns por cuidar tão bem desse Anjinho ❤
Dachshunds were breed to fearlessly  go into tunnels to flush out BADGERS! The tenacity and spunk of this breed will never cease to amaze me! She is too cute and definitely an inspiration!
This pup was very strong even after trying to keep her in her bubble she knew it was time to come out🙌🙌
What a doll
Amen thanks she's beautiful innocent adorable thanks so much Amen
Какая умница
Oh lord, she's too sweet. What a lil hammy angel!
a breeder that couldn't take care of her any longer -  I would say, a breeder who didn't WANT the responsibility. I'm not a fan of  breeders,.   But much respect to rescue the animals who irresponsible individuals don't want.
I can't get enough of these videos and this 1 is so amazing. 💗💕💖
😭😭😭 So glad you didn't give up on this precious pup! My heart is full!
The puppy is so cute!
Makes me happy to see she made it through the hard times in her puppy days. At first I was crying hoping she would get better and even stronger as she grew up.
You guys are TRULY THE REASONS WHY  ALL DOGS FEEL LIKE THEY ARE IN HEAVEN, BLESS YOU ALL ABUNDANTLY
Thank you. Thank you.
In a difficult and sometimes crazy world, dogs are here to remind us that we are loved and capable of loving.
How did you feed her?
The dedication! Wow. This is so heartwarming 💓💓
I wish I could adopt it
This is such a great story. Thank you🙏😘💯❤️
She's the most adorable baby canine I've ever seen!
This is the kind of thing that gets me full of hope.
3:23 I noticed a blanket that had the same exact pattern as the one we used to swaddle our chihuahua for cremation. Glad to see that fabric being used by another precious doggo.🥲
She is so cute I felt like tearing up
Sorry I need to use the bathroom 6:43
😭😭😭
ugh. please stop buying puppies from backyard breeders and mills. she has far more issues than just respiratory.
Super cute story
❤💜💙💗💙💛💚🤍💗❤
What a sweet,smart little survivor. How great that you fought for her and waited . Good luck for all of you.
I would take her she seems so cute
OMG she's so damn cute i need to punch something to feel manly again.
So we got our dog a lamb chop toy and it lasted him a while then he completely pulled it apart so we got him one in a bigger size it lasted two minutes. We got him an even bigger one it lasted him one minute.we got him the biggest size and it lasted him 30 seconds. WHY? Sally is so cute and I’m glad you got her healthy again!
I’m crying
Kiss That face
I bet the dog hates bubbles.
Damn onions.
This is amazing the way you just revived the puppy of the state of where it was to where she is now it truly is remarkable
what a sweet little puppy 🥺🤍 so happy she's okay and taken care of <3
Bravo curing her
I want that cute puppy ♥️
Thank you GEICO!!!
Cheers to GEICO foe bringing this story to us!!! Their former captors need to be shut down and/or heavily FINED!!
🥹 poor baby I’m glad that she has someone the takes care of her
What breed is she she’s adorable
so cutee
A great story of survival or privilege? Like its great the dog can breath again and lived. During the covid 19 pandemic so many people from poorer countries could not afford oxygen and died bc of that. I think this story highlights how truly privileged we are.
A huge thank you for doing this, Kathryn. We need to have more empathy for life—any life matters. This video has made my day. I also thank this family who adopted Sally, the bubble puppy.
Cute
So much love in this little pup. So many blessings and thanks to the young woman who nurtured and raised her.   Came dying from a breeder to a home of love and her oxygen bubble.  Thank youuuuu!
God bless You 💖💖
Strong puppy❤
😂what a cheeky little beauty!😂
You are an incredible Young Lady.Your love and dedication is in abundance 😀.❤❤❤
It's amazing how love can gives us comfort in life n to trive. I am so happy to see n know that more n more people treat this beautiful souls like us humans. I hate to hear when humans say they are just animal's. Indeed they're just animal's but they're living too.
Sally is such a smart dog
I'm so very much thankful to her🙏🏻
Que linda historia, gracias a Dios que ahora ya es una perrita sana, que buenas personas la cuidaron con tanto amor. Me conmovió su historia ♥️
Thank you ladys🙏❤️
That poor baby working so hawd to breed. 🥺 She wanted to be a regular pup. Thanks for your loving care of this girl. 😘
wow, great story, thank You
That’s so sad
Ahhhh! Ima go watch a movie with my dog right now!
OMG that puppy’s ears are so CUTE! I wanna snuggle that little puppy so bad! 😊
I love that vid it made me cry because I love doggys
My brother has asthma really bad when he was little we lived in a smoggy town. My family moved to a town near the ocean he started surfing spending all his time in the ocean breathing salt air and it healed his asthma after a year he didn't have asthma anymore so the environment is everything . Thanx for this sweet story.
Aw 😊, how sweet of y’all to take extra care of Sally and to get her into better health. It was adorable seeing her outside, exploring, meeting new dogs, and being around her family 😄
💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛 No words need.
Ghj
The lack of contact when she was small must have been so horrible.
The dog: WAIT Theres a world outside the bubble :o so cool  they take the dog outside  Dog: HOW MANY WORLDS ARE THERE??!? :OO
beautiful lady..thank you
I sympathize alot i spent 3 weeks on hiflo For the same thing
Beautiful
Omg the puppy is so cute as every creature is universe
Omg this truly beautiful and adorable 😢you guys are her angels 😇
So sweet! I admire the dedication of the family!
"A breeder who couldn't take care of her any longer."  i.e. It was too expensive to do the right thing. When animals are commodified, they are the ones who pay the price. ADOPT, don't shop.
Oh my heart 💜 what a happy story.  I'm still crying, though.  God bless the family who saved her. He gave us dogs as a special gift.  To love and give love. Simple
Did anyone else tear up? 🥹
Breeding is such a horrible practice for not caring about the results of poor gene pools
Oh my goodness what spirit in a tiny pup. She has survived an oxygen bubble and likes to try things out. What a beautiful little thing she is. Sally has had excellent care with the aid of two professionals who one looks after her now but still sees her other friend. Well done ladies you have done me proud and I hope that she enjoys her life with you. Much love and respect from across the pond in Uk x
Thanks for making me cry 😂 honestly it's beautiful to see this tiny baby grow up
👏👏🙏🙏❤️❤️🐾🐾🤗🤗
She a true fighter. 👍
Poor little dog,
My heart 🥹 she’s perfect
I was following the whole story from the beginning on instagram! I remember being so scared if she would make it. They even ran some health tests to see what was wrong with her.  And I remember being so relieved when they said she was stable and ready for adoption 🤗
Wow, this almost made me cry of joy
What kind of dog is she
Where's this video taken in?
Sally you are a precious little baby much hugs and kisses baby.💓💓💓💓💕💕💕💕💕💕
is it just me that thinks she SO CUTE?
Какая красивая малышка!!! Огромная благодарность за то, что Малышка осталась Жить. Всем здоровья, счастья и добра
Absolutely wonderful progress, kind souls.
She is so precious thank God for all the people that took care of her with all the infinite patience and love that they gave her and they still continue to.
I wish dodo would acknowledge how terrible breeders are…
I don't usually cry at stuff like these but THIS, made me shed tears.
Letting her stay by trees would have helped
From bean to sausage transformation! I could never do their work, I'd be sick most of the times cuz of heavy salt water loss from eyes.
Wow, a real life angel 🥹🫶🏽❤️  what a sweetheart
You are all (the vet techs, Bonnie, and Bonnie’s children) miracle workers ❤your love and care and patience healed her and gave her a real chance to survive and live her best life❤️
Breeders exploit the kindness of these people willing to rehab their rejects.
People need to stop being irresponsible breeders. Poor baby
So nice,sweet little dog..
7:10 THE WALK The height of any dog's existence. The moment where they are finally afforded the privilege of treading the path of their masters. Every dog understands the sacred beauty of THE WALK. It is a ritual which has been conducted between human and dog since time immemorial. It is not just an honor to partake in THE WALK; it is the true proving of a dog. A sign that have they have matured and are worthy. A rite of passage.
U literally got me sad
Awh this is the first time I’ve seen u and I’ll probably watch more
CUTEST dog ever!!!
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
God bless you guys, you know you go straight to heaven for taking such good care of fur babies. 😀 she's beyond cute. 😍
May these ladies be blessed with great karma for giving the little creature a chance to experience life. I believe how we treat others and living things do not go unnoticed. The judgment comes when we croak.
I know your pain very well, little one. Not be able to get air in or out and the feeling that you're being suffocated is scary. Glad you're doing well.
So inspiring!
it was so sad when she was walking on the floor it feels like she can’t walk :(
Bless this pup
WOW!!!
Dogs are the best!  Way to save this jewel!
what a sweet story 😍
The bubble puppy
Such a beautiful  story she's so cute and very cheeky she's a little princess 👸
What beautiful people never giving up on this precious precious little angel 😭❤ thankyou thankyou thankyou!  She is adorable beyond words! 🥰 I hope she and her forever family share the happiest healthiest long life together ❤🙏🏼❤   Ps Does anyone else think she should have been renamed ‘bubbles’? 😁🛁🥰
Im glad the previous owner  who couldnt take care of her took her to the vet ( or adoption center idk) its way better than them keeping her and just hoping she’d survive❤
okay this is so sad but she is so darn cute
Ohhh she is so tiny! And cute. And handsome. And poor little baby...such a struggle
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This proves that with patience, kindness, and love, anyone can recover from their illness. Sally, you are an angel that proved that.
oddly after watching my son ive learned that babies of any sort know when theyre ready for the next step and it can be scary to watch and experience but if you trust them its incredible   my son is 3 months old and hasnt left the nicu he was born at 23 weeks but hes always let us know when hes ready to move forward he will remove his oxygen support when he is ready for a less intensive version sometimes it can take a while to figure what hes doing but thats essentially what this puppy did as well the "hey i dont need this anymore" is an awesome thing to witness
I love this story. Sally is so cute and I’m so glad her lungs got better. Now she can be a happy dog and live a happy life with her new family
Thank you for sharing this beautiful story. What a wonderful ending.🤗❤😍
Btw, I absolutely loooove this story. I wldnt trade this is one for the world. It's sweet, adorable and more awesome than words. Thank u for sharing. Im wanting to watch more videos. I loooove animals. They r the loves of my life. Yes they r. Grt story. Love u
Stories like this make me want to cry knowing this isn't the only time this has happened, and that it will happen to another poor being out there sometime. But this pup made it, and kept fighting to finally live her life normally. Go Sally! ❤
Curious about this dog...did it have a cleft?
AWWW I LOVE IT IT WAS SO CUTE!!!
Thank you for not giving up on Sally.
did the new owner ever change her shirt or did they film all of that in one day
This is the first time where iv seen a dog have a simular event happen to it like the *"Iron lung"* (A litrall machine that helps you breath)
Oh such a precious baby and so smart🥰
This animal came from a “breeder that couldn’t take care of her any longer”. What the hell kind of a backyard breeder can’t take care of an animal? The truth of the matter is this poor animal is sick and the poor little backyard breeder didn’t want the dog any longer because she wouldn’t make any money if all the funds went into keeping this animal alive. I fucking hate people who exploit animals like backyard breeders.
🥰🥰🥰🥰
It shows the love from very special people towards Gods creatures , your all very special including Sally ❤️
I'm so glad she has a loving home.💖
hello dd, another daschund saved - did not know they come out so tiny of a puppy.  the german shepherd was my family dog and he was half beagle.  the pup came out happy with bonnie home.  elle for no dog house
Sally is simply adorable 🥰🥰🥰🥰 I am glad that they didn't give up on her. She is an amazing puppy!🐾🐾🐾
You saved her just like i saved my dog she got kennel cough but she got better now she already a 1 year old so this is so inspiring for other people
That makes my week.
❤❤❤
ADORABUNCHABLES!!!
Kisses for Sally! 💋 💕
Great work for this tiny dog who is struggling for oxygen dependent. Thank you for take care of her.
At last, humanity faith is returned

what a little fighter! what a sweet girl
She's so cute
Beautiful 😘
Sweet baby girl ❤️Her will to live was everything. These people are literal angels who never gave up on the girl that refused to give up ❤️
Yes Thank you for sticking with her You all are so blessed 💜💚💚💛🧡❤
How did you let her go to be adopted, I wouldn't have been able to my heart would have broken 💔 She's beautiful you are so lucky to have her 🥹
neat 👍
Such gentle patience.
I love this channel ❤️ Sally is too adorable 😍
That’s a cat
Peggy 😊
What a beautiful baby, OHMYGOSH, I LOVE HER!
OMG I Can't EVEN...❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
she reminded me of myself when I was 5 years old. I couldnt walk very far before I felt dizzy and when I went to kindergarten one of my family members always carried me. I remember struggled to try to walk for few meters then stopped when I feel dizzy but keep trying until I can walk around like friends of my age
What kind souls to put so much time & effort into making sure Sally got a chance. So many would have given up on her. And what a cutie ❤
My dog was born prematurely and was so tiny the vet said she wouldn’t make it she made it 12 years this little one is a fighter
no one can do better for her in this world than you guys.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The patience it took  monitored the puppy second-by-second, to minutes by minutes, all to give one little puppy a chance to live, were extraordinary and kind. And the puppy also learned how to monitor herself so as not to overdo it. Amazing what observation and dedication can do.
Lucky dog.
super sweet video, thank you for this :)
I have never seen anything like this. This is just amazing work you've done.
I can't reach into this video to love on that sweet baby. If I could I would. Animals love unconditionally.
BEAUTIFUL SOULS💝💖💯
SHES JUST SO ADORABLE 🥰🥰 OH 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
May your God look kindly on you. This video reduced a 60 year old man to tears.
❤❤ BEAUTIFUL STORY
She is such a sweetheart, I fall in love with her...
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤❤
Awe, what a beautiful story. I love the way you all took care of her and now she's living her best life. Thank you all of the Vet Techs for what you do. You truly are appreciated. 🐕🐾🦴🐾🐕
omg i love her
Now who's cutting onions.....😭😭😭😭😭
dam ninjas chopping onions again
Such a teeny warrior. 🤍
What kind of puppy is Sally?
Each and every one of you guys in this video are AWESOME! SALLY and her new family are just PERFECT TOGETHER!! God Bless!
SUCH A CUTE LITTLE PUPPY!!
The cutest pup I've ever seen ♥️
Sweet.baby💜💜
this is the most perfect dog i have ever seen i am so in love with her
Hey we're not doing like like we're not on Mars an oxygen out there is just not good well like a vacuum hard to breathe if you can't get it in the wind is blowing so fast but you know when it gets there well that space is beyond the vastness unbreathable and good for her she's on her planet Earth that's science
She's beautiful and such a cutie pie ❤️
She’s so precious
I cried and so happy for sally
She's the most gorgeous puppy I've ever seen!!!
Now I'm even more excited because I'm getting a puppy or maybe 2  but probably not but now this makes me even more excited to have one because of how adorable Sally is❤
Oh man I started crying, Sally is such an adorable puppy
To pass the word, there is a channel called Momo the  b i n g l e. And on that channel that guy has a cat named Liam who has asthma. And he teaches us how to recognize the symptoms if your cat is asthmatic and about what it looks like if your car is having asthma attacks/how the asmatic cats is Wheezing and he demonstrates how he gives Liam a inhaler treatment using a device that kind of looks like a baby bottle that goes over Liam's nose and attaches to the inhaler medicine.
I hope this place gets the funding it deserves, is there a place to donate?
She’s such a SWEETHEART! You just want to pick her up and snuggle her closer!
You are wonderful pet parents!🎉
"she would KNOW when she needed to go back in oxygen chamber"  Amazing 👏 so smart yet so tiny. Thank God ❕😊
8:48 My dog has that same lamb toy😂
Thank you for taking care of her. She is a wonder to us all.❤❤❤❤
Beautiful story ❤
😊
💖Thank YOU for this Sally  vid !💖
oh my soul she is a precious little puppy
This reminds me of the movie Bubble Boy
Thank you for all you did oh what a precious little baby! And I'm so thrilled she got a wonderful home!
A little angle covered in fur .
So enlighten me is she a preemie  ??
Fantastic. Well done
Can you imagine someone from a 3rd world seeing this video? Lol kinda crazy to do for a puppy.
You make the world a better place!!!
You are amazing to have worked so hard to save Sally.  Thank you for your diligence!   She became a little stinker!  Sooo cute.
Why do you stupid people put clothes on animal? They are not human babies, you are not in Alaska. NEVER dress animals in clothes.
IS THAT MUSTANG SALLY
🐕
What is she? You said a breeder gave her to you. Is she a Dachshund? Just curious.
Po lit baby oh sweet and heartwarming so adorable 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰oh let me have some toilet paper 🗞️🗞️🗞️🗞️🗞️ l had to go potty
So precious so sweet. Just a little TLC. And then there was life... 2 years ago my neighbor walked over with a pitbull/lab. We knew our matriarch would be going soon. She was turning 17 and slowing down. My husband looked at me and said, oh no we're going to lose luna. I said I know. Every time a dog walks in another dog walks out. He said to me, remember when we lost our matriarch labrador. And you told me wait, we're going to wait, he was looking to find a new dog to fill that missing spot.  I said wait they will find us. He's like they? How does one dog find you they is like three. I said yeah they will find us...  Well they did. Three dogs. We had them going on 10 years now.. so in our neighbor walked in with this new dog. My husband knew oh no when one door opens another one closes.   We lost our matriarch seven months later. So beautiful so lovely a white eskimo. My belka Luna. My squirrel Moon.   This new pup. So precious. She inherited of course all of the toys. The only dog that would play would be my luna. The other dogs would look at the toys like, no thanks you're funny. But Luna love to play. And her new puppy did too. So precious. Her being a pit I was worried oh no she's going to chew a part and destroy all the toys but then again so does my luna. You give her a toy, even the tough toys she can destroy within less than a week. Sometimes one day. But this dog, this dog treats them as if they are her babies. She soft mouths them.  Never once has she destroyed any of the toys. As a matter of fact, the last toy my matriarch received. And slept with for the two nights before her death. That toy She carries around like her wooby... She sleeps with it every night. I have to wash it quite often. Because she carries it around in her mouth and she'll bark and she'll talk with it in her mouth and by the end of the day it is full of so much slobber. So it gets washed quite often. But I think it's so sweet no other toys she carries around like that just Luna's.   It's amazing how dogs know. Her coming in to our world being a puppy I was worried. Especially with Luna not doing so well. But she was very careful and watched over her. Always allowed her to go before her. Was very sweet when she came up to her. Instead of she new, I'm coming in and you're leaving. I miss her so much. Sometimes I see her out of the corner of my eye. As a matter of fact the other day my husband came in and said oh my gosh I just saw Luna on the porch. I said yep you're going to catch her out of the corner of your eye. She's still with us. She hasn't left her home yet. Warms my heart. I love animals so much. They bring such love to our homes. What a blessing.

She's the must cutest puppy and prettiest I've ever seen 😍
Quite litterally the most inspiring story I have aver heard!! I love that good pupper!!
❤❤❤
stop breeding animals you creeps
What a beautiful story
Yep, I'm crying.
I haven't cried in about 20 years. Thank God I am human after all.  😂
The breeder or so called breeder should be banned from breeding
Sally your a true angel
Wow you guys are amazing thank God for all of you🌻🌻🤗
You go lil Sally!! Soo glad you no longer need that oxygen! I know, it isn't fun at all!!  I'm still on mine darmit!? ;) Have a wonderful life!!🤗😉❤️
Love her so much 😍😍😍😍😍
My father was a design engineer for NASA and designed the oxygen chambers for the Apollo flights. This is sweet to see xx
She’s absolutely adorable!!!❤
May God give her long life..
Dogs are too precious for this world! 😭
I took care of a dog during those weeks, everything was going well and she was already having teeth, but I don't know what happened, she started to have sudden paralysis, she cried and told my mother "Mom, canela is not right, we have to take her to the vet" But she said that there was no money, knowing that there is a very cheap clinic in the city, in the end Canela left, I sincerely miss her..It was worth being in every second of his life, it was the most beautiful thing I have ever experienced, raising a living being.
Baby hermoso ❤️❤️
This felt like a whole 5 feet apart movie🥺 such a warrior
Hermoso perrito,como pueden no amar un angelito asi?? 💙❤️❤️💙
You are an amazing kind loving person xxx
Omg so adorable 🥰
Brilliant
Sally is such a cute little ball of energy. Great story, thanks for sharing.
Those guys are amazing for helping such a remarkable puppy survive.
”Breathe AIR” - Sally tate
Shes precious!!
Shes so cute tiny body Big heart❤
This is such a sweet story. I'm so happy Sally made it & got a good home
If my dog had experienced that kind of lung problem Sally had, I wouldn't risk that dog getting into unclean water like the kind found in lakes and streams. Even the normally clean creeks and river tributaries near us have had reports of dangerous algea blooms in recent years. Inhaling the toxins that can come with the blooms can be deadly.
Fantastic
So pleased she made it and got to live a happy life
SHE HAS A DIFFERENT EYE?-
This really made my day! Absolutely wonderful!
Fabulous story of this little fighter
Aww, she's like me.. I was born early and had some trouble breathing, I have the scars on my chest to prove it! Doctors said I wouldn't survive but here I am!
Thank you for taking the time to save this puppy life
What an amazing story! Thank you for helping her to enjoy life! New family is wonderful too!
It’s Moors not Moops!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank God Sally found a lovely family !!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I didn’t know that bubble puppy was going to grow into my favorite kind of dog. ❤️
“She loves it!”  The dog: *runs out the pool*
There is still good in this world as this video illustrated ❤️🙏
I absolutely love dachshunds, and I am beyond happy that they gave her a chance at life!!
Beautiful
This is so adorable 🥰
how did you know how much oxygen to give her?  What a sweetie!
I love stories like these.....she's so adorable
Poor little baby had such a rough start into life. I'm glad she recovered so well! Good to see there are still some good people in this world.
Bubble puppy decided life’s better instead of imminent death so he instantly cured himself 😂
She’s a _bUbLe_
She is sooooio cute I want her plz can I have her
Can I have her plz
What kind of pup is she?
What an extraordinary woman you are, to give that little baby a chance and keep on when most would have given up.  Then to be able to find someone who understood the complexities of her care is just remarkable.  I hope everyone involved knows what special people they are.  And what can I say about that little fighter, who knows her own limits?  What a gorgeous girl.  Thank you for sharing such an uplifting story.
You are an angel for saving this little dog.
Could someone tell me what type of dog she is? Thank you,
Best story ever. 😢 love Sally ❤
I have just acquired a towering respect for vet technicians! I’m in awe of your knowledge and compassion.
What an absolutely gorgeous story. Beautiful people. Adorable little spunky Sally. May she have a glorious life with her friends.
Cute
She is sooo beautyful!!!! 😗☝️🤲💛💛💛💛
😢😥
😍😍😍😍😍
omg she’s the cutest puppy ever
I love her
A little bit of a confusion, isn’t there oxygen outside of the bubble too?
U can not tell me u did not cry 😢 😢
♥️♥️♥️ Sally ♥️♥️♥️ 🙏 God bless all the people who work so diligently to save this sweet soul. God Bless her new family who takes such loving care of her. I cannot stop the flow of tears of Joy ♥️♥️♥️ Sally ♥️♥️♥️
Such a great journey for little miss Sally! Good work not giving up on her, well done! Lovely video, keep up the good work.🥰
Can we just have a moment for the stellar wardrobe?!! That is one precious little peanut! LOVE this story!! 😀
I would like to thank every single person who was and still is involved in her recovery to a beautiful life.  May all of you kindhearted souls be blessed by God to be able to help out other doggies, Amen!!!!  May you, Sally be blessed to get to live a vibrant, beautiful, and colorful life till death do you part from this world and then get to enjoy your life in heaven with all the other doggies up there!!  May God bless you, Sally!!!  Hope to see another video of you soon!!  Bye, love you, Sally, Leo from Texas.
Who is cutting onions 🥲😍🥰 beautiful soul !!
This is so worth it...🥰
Call me crazy but I would’ve named her Bubbles! 🥰
Sally’s one of the cutest puppies I’ve ever seen
Was anyone else taking deep breaths while watching this? 😂
She's so friggin cute, I can't stand it!
Nice 👍
Just put the dog down and get another. There, I said it. I'm my dad's son. The tree branch fell on my head.
Please consider putting her in a proper crate when in a vehicle. If someone hits you she'll just fly through the car if unrestrained. Probably getting seriously injured.
I really want to know what is this disease?
Thank you so much to the people who kept this baby alive. I'm so glad she gets to live a happy, fulfilled life.
She’s a warrior for sure.
God bless God bless
She has the biggest heart!
❤cute
Sweet little 👼 puppy! 💕🐕💕👼
GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU  - YOU FOR TAKING CARE OF THIS LITTLE DOG - THIS LITTLE BEING -
Thank you for the happy ending. I admit I was afraid that she wouldn't make it, but she's a fighter! Well done on helping her live.
I could not do what this woman did, i would not be able to not love non stop on that pup, omg that tiny auuuuuuuw behind the bubble🥺💖💖💖💖💖this is why i could never work as a vet, these situations where ppl Are like here is a pup put it down cuz it is a sick pup.. No cant do it i will always try and save it but sometimes it is the only choice that would break me big time 😖😖😖vets, nurses docs etc. 💖💖💖Could not do what u Guys do
How does the oxygen bubble help her breathe there's oxygen everywhere
Amazing! ✨💖 And she is so cute 😍🤗🥰
It’s interesting how sometimes the fear of being caged outweighs the fear of death.
Baby!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
god is good
I cried happy tears, so glad for sally
That is probably the cutest dog ever and I’m so glad that you helped her live her life and get with a amazing family❤
God bless you guys 🙏🙏🙏❤️🐶
🥰
All animals are beautiful 😇.
Than you for helping that poor baby. God will bless you.
I cried through the entirety of this video. What a sweet little girl. I’m so glad she’s thriving 💕
I Had Never Seen A Creature (Aside From Humans) So Understanding Of Their Situation But So Determined To No Longer Have Said Weakness To Ruin Their Life, Glad That Pup Didn't Give Up & Assert Her Authority On *WHEN* They're Ready To Stay Outside A Bubble.
the blades of grass must have been torture on the bottom of her feet!
Thank you guys for doing so much to give her a chance and a good life every dog deserves love and happiness
This puppy should have been put down. Cruel.
I love her
sweet,,,
Great video your a real God send
Sally is so joyful.  Beautiful story of a very special puppy❤
I’m glad she’s ok. Can’t stand angels going through pain. Bless her huge soul.

Agonal breathing. Sad.

bro im crying rn i love this dog so muc
Never cease to amaze me how humans could be so caringly loving and wonderful to pets yet so awful to other humans.
This is literally the sweetest video ever
🥰🥰🥰🥺💜🧡❤💛❤️‍🩹
I thought this was a fake dog!! oh my god!!
Her spinning in that little dress, my ❤️❤️❤️❤️.😫
crunchy snack
So precious!  The love and patience was so admirable.  I love a happy ending❤
You all are so wonderful to go to this trouble for this sweet and very cute little girl doggie.  Bless you all.
SHE'S SO CUTE AAA
I’ve seen a lot of doggie miracle stories, but none of them have come close to this! This is so adorable and heartwarming!
Also she will grow the biggest and strongest out of the litter
She is so adorable.
Why can't more people be like this woman?
sometimes i hate when humans mess with nature and then theres times like this im so glad we do
What a cutie
OMG the thumbnail is so cute 😍😍😍😍🐶
I needed to see this today ❤
Im gojng to cry the puppy is sooooooooo cute ♥︎♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Im going to cry
I can’t even imagine the willpower on your end not to be able to touch her or caress her or be a mama to her, it must’ve been unbearable, necessary of course but unbearable
Soooooo sweet
I wander what her lungs looked like before and after that would be cool to see the difference
So so so cute. What a tiny little puppy❤️❤️❤️ so glad you took care of this dog. It’s a miracle.
Sally's beautiful. I'm so happy you fought for her. Such a beautiful lil soul. 💜💜💜
Beautifull!
😭😭😭
You named her sally???? Not Bubbles or rOXY?
What a cutie
Awesome story
Bubble boy want his puppy back
So Very Loving. I Praise our Lord for people like you.  Thank You for your loving care for a beautiful puppy.
God bless people who would take this on....❤️
What a nice and sweet story of persistence and love of an animal.  What a nice family for the dog to be a part of for the rest of her life.
if i was a animal this would literally have been me, ever since i was rlly tiny i had horrible asthma and i would have so many Pneumonias and i would be at a hospital A LOT- and seeing sally made me so happy, this is proof that good things come in life when most needed
What a remarkable team and of course the puppy
What an amazing group of people!  I am so thankful for such wonderful humans. What a lesson for the world! 😇😇💙💚💜🤍🖤💛🧡❣️❣️🫂 Imagine if even half the world consisted of such kind, compassionate, loving, dedicated,  successful problem-solving people, what a wonderful world the critters and we could be living in!
8:47 i have that lambchop stuffy shes squeaking   but instead of a dog/cat toy it was one of my first ever stuffys
I love how she took care of her and knew she would make it.  Sally is so precious  and you are a remarkable and loving woman. Just beautiful.
She is soo dang cute!!
Health technology today is amazing.
Beautiful  and cute little creature. I hope she doesn't run afoul of a pitbull or other simular temperment dog. Her owner MUST KEEP  HER VACCINATIONS up to date. Be a shame to lose her to a canine respiratory disease after doing so well. Best wishes.
Omg Thank you for taking her on and never giving up 9n her.  God Bless you for never giving up.🙏🏼
Poor sweet baby...how lonely it must have been for the first little bit 😢 💔  All those hard, lonely days and nights gave her the ability to live this amazing new life that these beautiful people are, and will no doubt, always give her!   The best story I've heard in a very long time!! 😁  Live, love and laff little one!! You've absolutely earned it❣️  Love and best wishes for all the angels who helped to save her ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So sweet 😭😭😭😭😭
This puppy went from lung problems cant come outside to “IM GETTING THIS TOY!” energy❤
Awesome job guys 👏 ❤
Lol I love how she just CANT BE STOPPED but it was really funny to think Faced with living in an air chamber: Im going to try! 2mins outside the bubble: Still trying! 15mins: Still workin hard to live hard! 20mins: Whew! Im gonna be smart and know my limits. But onward tomorrow!  Faced with watery surfaces and wet paws:  NAHHHH, fam. Full skeptical face. Thats a NO from me...  Triumphed over fear in the end...but I love how every single step she has made HER choice!💗💗💗
Gracias Gracias por Salvarla ...eres una gran persona y ella una preciosura 🐕💞💕💓👸👆👆
Healed by the power of loving care....so glad to know this miniature glow ball made it through!!
iam not crying.. iam not crying...... i cry.
shes just the cutest. shes recovering on her own and thats the best part about it. i also noticed her eyes are two different colors and its so pretty. i hope she grows up to be the most amazing puppy ever. yall are the best, what you did to help her was amazing ❤

No there isn't any onions next to me, I am just tearing up.
What a Beautiful Heart Warming story Bless her heart Guardian Angel's and God had a plan for this girl be happy and healthy 🐕🐾🧡
Bella historia dura al principio y gracias a Dios un final feliz
**OH WHAT AN ADORABLE LITTLE BABY!!  MY BUBBLE BABY!!  I LOVE YOU!!**
This dog is getting better healthcare then 100% of the human population.
I’m actually crying because of this.  This is so cute and sweet I can’t :(
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."  (1 Corinthians 13:13)🙏
Such an adorable little puppy 🐶 😍 💕 Please let it have the most amazing, happy healthy and loving life that a dog could ever have.  I LOVE U Puppy ❤
This is the cutest dog I’ve ever seen
Amazing video thank you all for taking care of her.
Sally is a strong survivor for pulling through and living without her oxygen, I’m so proud
So lovely💗 what a beautiful story 💖 full of love 💟 thanks a lot for not giving up💓LOL ❤ and cuddles 💞from Italy 💚 🤍 ❤
Qué hermosas personas que no se rindieron y que ahora le pueden dar una gran vida❤
Sally’s journey is amazing. Thank you for giving her a chance. God bless you, Sally and her new family. I hope she lives to be a hundred.❣️❣️❣️😇🙏🏻
She is sooo cute.
I’m not crying
five minutes too long but very touching and kind hearted.
Yayyyy!! Happy story ❤❤❤
What happened to Sally? She looks so small but.. she's so cute, tiny and adorable.. 😘❤️🐕👍🏻
I WANT HER SO BAD 😭😭😭
It’s so heart warming to see the energy in the heal process these ladies are angels
I liked this twice because of the cuteness
As an asthmatic my heart goes out to this baby. I know how awful it is to gasp for breath. I’m so happy you were able to help her ❤
The fact that even as a young pup she understood that she needed to be in her bubble and when she needs it is so cool! Nature it wild ^^
shes so cuteee, im really glad she got her breathing back and a super loving family <3
God love it's heart!!! And God bless all of you!!
Bless you guys ❤️
She is adorable ❤️  Thank you for not giving up on Sally
What a lovely story
I love puppies and kittens. I can't do dogs and cats though.
Very cute
That is one of the cutest dogs  I ever seen and when I first saw that I just turned weak and went like “give me that 😭 so cute 😭”
Need these feel good stories cause damn if the world doesnt suck some times
Gratidão gratidão 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
mah heart - mah soul - why does it melt!!?!??!?
🐕😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👍
Looks like she struggled through illness
I can’t imagine how stressful it must have been to get to this point. Learning to trust her and taking those big steps like going to the dog park. The constant thought of needing to keep her oxygen bubble close by just in case, Was probably so nerve racking. What a beautiful story ❤ a puppy who once was unable to be out of the oxygen bubble for more than a few seconds, now lives a full and happy life with her family and other dogs 🥹. Bless everyone who contributed to her recovery!
Bless the vet technicians for giving Sally the best life she deserves
She's so adorable, I'm glad she survived
This is the cutest pup I've ever seen
God bless these people I cried multiple times listening to her story ❤
Really unique & amazing story. Loved it! Thanks for sharing it.
anyone else thought that they meant bubble puppy as on bubble guppies lol
What a darling animal!
the dog is kinda like me when i was a baby
Omg she is an angel!!
Ohhh maybe it has asma like me
That pup really has the will to live & be a happy, lively pup. ❤❤❤
Such a wholesome video, videos like this restores my faith in humanity. Not every human is a mfing monster.
The most interesting video I've seen today
I used to only watch dodo on YouTube kids but I love being greeted by this little pup on youtube
Beautiful story 💖
That lady is bae
How wonderful that this sweet pup was saved! I love it that she knew when she was ready to stay out in the world without her oxygen. She looks to be part dachshund.
How do you feed her and what’s the thing on her nose
OK clearly I wasn’t ready for her cuteness awnnnn ❤❤❤❤ soooo much love and dedication has been put through for Sally thank you guys for not giving up easily
Aaaww, too damn cute! 🤗
Such a beautiful precious pup! She’s so gorgeous. God Bless that sweet Lady and Sally’s beautiful hearts.
ahahaha...60X inflated Yes, I accept your challenge.  Don't cry when your "a s" is "smoked"...
Fantastic. My respect.
Awhh🥺💔💕
wow, that's cute, even for me
Can I ultra like
Bubble puppy omg im now being reminded of Bubble guppies lol
Amazing use of resources and patience shown by these animal lovers. Where can I apply to get inside one those bubbles?
oh my god 😍😍😍😍😍
Thank you for sharing such a happy ending story, this little girl is beautiful with her wonderful guardian angels around her. Thank you all for your kind big loving hearts. 🙏🏼❤️🇬🇧
GORGEOUS, HEARTWARMING story!! Thanks for sharing! NEVER GIVE UP !!!
I wish all vets were like you. You've melted my heart and my husbands.  How did you put her tube in as looks like it's through her nose and head? I'm only asking as I thought in the thumbnail it was a decoration until I watched the video lol.  I would've loved this little girl. The video has made us so emotional. Just by giving this beautiful little girl a chance you actually gave her a proper life.
What a beautiful gorgeous puppy!🥰❤️🐶❤️🥰
Oh my goodness this baby just melts my heart!!! 😍
Glad see was adopted by a coworker,and therefore know 100% what to do,I'm very happy about this.This is one of my favorite videos on YouTube.
Dachsies are the best.  What a sweetie pie!
So adorable!!
You are an angel x
She she didn't need it as much smart baby I am crying I am happy she made a good recovery  poor baby
The amount of time and effort the lady took so sally could be happy …is very beautiful and important for someone who is wanting or having a pet
Poor baby omg Jesus heal her
❤❤❤
Look at her go, that is one tough little cookie. Once she no longer needed that bubble, she was free to run and play. She is just precious! 🐕
Amazing 🥲🥰
Those ears 😘
Augh! That poor baby!
You ladies are the bees knees 😘
You guys did a fantastic job whipping her back into shape kudos to the both of you
Adorable puppy❤😇😇😇🐶🐶
A stethoscope would also be handy for knowing how the pneumonia is progressing...
You can get one of those new, very compare oxyfen generators, concertss air to oxygen in a machine the size of a large yard backed dictionary... That would make it easier for sick animals needing oxygen to go outside for longer periods.
You guys let me know that there are Angels among us. Such a beautiful story…. Lots of people would have given up… Love and caring….. Best medicine
Its amazing how many " breeders " cant take care of sick puppies from their own litters  Real love for pets i tell ya
What a cute little angel and what a great recovery story. Thanks to the Vets who took care of her as young thing and then adopting her. Kudos to you guys, you are ahmazing!
Is she a miniature longhair dachshund? Precious little girl.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Oxygen is a very dangerous game- severe damge can be done by being on pure oxygen at high concentrations for prolonged periods. Its a catch 22, you need the oxygen but there is a chance the oxygen could make things worse.  I am so so glad this worked out so well, good for you for supporting her to this point! Its a good job a vet tech had her. X
No bro... SHES SO CUTEEEEEEE.. I love her so freaking much ...
No I'm not the cry 😭 Your cry👉 She's TOO Cute 🥺😭❤️
Sad thing is I'm sure the breeder had the money to help her to get better and just chose not to because it wasn't easy money like the rest of the litter! It's so sad 😢. But she has a great family now and that's all that matters.
Cotton is the only material safe in a Oxygen tent otherwise you have a fire hazard.
That is a awesome story...thank you so much for sharing it with us! She is a beautiful lil pup & full of so much life. Its sometimes so much easier to assume that the animal isn't gonna recover so we put em down & don't really try. But u guys gave her a chance & omgoodness she made a recovery. I had a dog that got really sick at the age of 1. The vet told me that I need to put him down cause all he is doing is suffering & he isn't gonna make it anyway. But I saw a look in his eye that was telling me not to give up on him. So I talked the Vet into sending me home with the fluids & meds that he needed plus everything else I wouldn't be able to get on my own without the vets help, cause I was gonna fight for my Boy & kno1 was gonna convince me otherwise. So I gave him fluids under the skins, IV antibiotics, pain med & anything else I had to do to keep him alive. He was a sick pup thats forsure! I even slept next to him every night so I could hear his breathing...he loved it! And then after several days & me starting to question myself if I was doing the right thing. He stood up & walked to the door to go outside. I was shocked cause I was having to help him every step of the way & sometimes even massage that area so he would go. But now my Boy was walking on his own & asking to go out...WHAT!!! It was such a awesome feeling to know he was gonna b ok & I didn't give up on him. After that day he improved daily & withing a lil over a week my beautiful big puppy was fully recovered. So I get that fight & understand why some of us just can't give up on our animals. If it was cancer & a guarantee it will spread then sure help them pass on. But when there's even a lil chance of survival I just gotta try. GOD BLESS!!!
Awe so adorable 🥰
You are an angel. God bless you. ❤
She is precious. When she was having trouble breathing it literally made me cry. I felt so badly for the little angel but what a fighter. It's awesome that she knows her physical limits and when to rest. Thank you for helping her to thrive. I'm so glad she has a wonderful, loving, forever home, awesome parents and siblings.
DAMNIT WHY AM I CRYING SO MUCH?!!? I DON'T EVEN HAVE ONIONS!!!
What an amazing story.🤍 Both Sally and the women who helped her are so strong :)
I'm so grateful that there's still amazing people out there that would take the time to help this beautiful little critter.

The word Adorable doesn't come lose to describing her. Thank you for taking care of her. 💖

☝🏽 Out of tens-hundreds-thousands of videos I've watched this one has to be in my top 3 better yet my Favorite 💜 OMG when the care taker was able to fit inside the  bigger chamber ..I said that's so me 🤣 Ma'am get out the box...No I want to cuddle 😃
Adorable miracle puppy! I love that she is called Sally! Perfect!❤👍😊🙏🍀
What a sweet little angel ! I saw this on my YT feed before and ignored it thinking it was just one more video to tug at my heartstrings ; but I am glad now I finally watched it because she got to me with her sweetness & adorable spirit.
This dog is so brave to face the wild world. And so do we as a human (talk to myself)..
🥰❤🙏🐈You go little one so many people are 👏🥳🤩cheering you on  the world needs more stories like this 😇😂💖💖💖🙏🙏🙏🐈🐈🐈 THANK-YOU ALL that helped this little gal find happyiness
Ma perché non lo fai vivere normalmente a questo povero cagnolino che sta meglio di te e si vede😡🥷🏻
Cried like a baby for the first half of that. Beautiful story. Keep on fighting.
What a little trooper! So cute! Glad she improved!
Great job! Thank you fpr taking care of pets
Yes, l am crying, so happy for her
Why am I always crying every time I watch DODO videos?🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
I loved wen she go’s to her toys
Dogs should have a Life Jacket on around water. Just in case! Best of Luck to this little girl!
❤️❤️❤️
Nice job Kathryn with you & your team giving Sally a normal dog life..Plus nice video from beginning to end..
To see people with the patience and heart  to rescue a tiny creature when there is every chance that It won’t survive, restores a bit of my faith in people. Sally was in great hands and she appears to be thriving.  Thank you for caring.
Every animal has a soul. Especially you guys.
I would have named her bubbles honestly
Baby girl is so precious 😍 💕 💖 💗
It's vets like this that make me have trust in th3m cause they don't care for the money they only care for the animals
Yes I love crying
MY HEART MY HEART MY HEART‼️‼️🤯🤯🤯❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍
She’s a fighter
She is the most precious thing in the world!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
I have nothing but just pure respect for you ma'am♥️♥️♥️♥️
Beautiful story! Glad you guys didn't give up on her💕
Pups are social animals. She wanted love even more than the air needed to live. Glad you made sure she was safe and healthy before letting her outside. She is a fighter.
im melting and crying
Thank you so much for saving her..Sally is so strong, we're all very, very proud of her. Bless you, where ever you are..❤️❤️😘❤️❤️❤️
She's more exuberant than I am! There's really a God given healing gift in just love warmth and nature.🌞🥰
Omg I just realized I can't even watch her without crying out so loud....She is so adorable little girl and I'm a coward... Sorry my baby girl for that... I'm already in love with you ❤️😭🙏🏽 Please stay alive and well ⁉️⁉️⁉️🙏🏽✝️❤️😭🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷
I know I couldn't have taken care of her, I'm so happy to see her thrive!
What an incredible journey 💖
This one Truly made my Heart Smile!
This is too cutee🥺
Nature's will to survive is truly amazing. She's such a cutie 😊
Her story is similar to David Vetter.  Unfortunately, he had somewhat of an offensive title, labeling him as: "Bubble Boy."
I have loved dachshunds since the first time I met one. So glad this little girl had people that cared enough to go the extra mile. Edit for spellcheck
Aw! I hope Sally is still doing great, and i hope she didnt ever again ran out of oxygen 😊
Awwee such a CUTE PUPPY ❤️❤️
So thrilled Sally had such wonderful people caring for her, what a will to live she has!!! ❤️
this is one of the most beautiful stories I have ever seen. Sally is so adorable, and I wish her a very long, healthy, and joyous life ❤️🙏🎉🎊.
5:46 bruh 💀
lol how she was wobbling like poing poing
Who’s crying??? Not me, must be the onions! But seriously, these people go above and beyond for these precious souls. Thank you a million times for what you do.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 you saved the litter puppy’s life .  That’s amazing
BEAUTFIUL people! You did an amazing thing! :)
thats so sweet, im happy she survived 🥺
Adorable pup, my dog is also a wiener dog :)
oh my god , did you see the way she reacted when she saw her first mum ,  first mum should have kept her forever.
I would cram myself into that small bubble with her. I would not be able to contain myself. Physical closeness is so crucial for survial.
That Doxie has MOXIE!!!  😇  Seriously, this is such a "dream come true" ending for this precious little Pup-Pup...Her two Mom's are true angels with such loving & compassionate hearts...This innocent little Doxie will have the best life now with this such a dear family, & with little kids to run around & play with...Such a *g r e a t* story to warm your heart...I LOVE it...
That is the cutest wiener dog
❤
Dog suffered aspiration pneumonia, also did not like water at first. Does this dog know what happened🤔
Wonderful, wonderful happy story!!!!!!!!
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
That cute pup is so cute that it touches my heart I've been born with asthma
Such a sweet story. I don't think I could have given her up though. Thank you for taking care of this sweet girl. My heart is happy.
This was the sweetest story
What a beautiful, sweet girl. A tough pup!
The dog is so cute!!
Such a cute dog. Had troubles but grew out of it. Just so cute!
Hopefully the poor puppy’s health improves
"She was completely oxygen dependent." Sounds normal to me. 👍
Beutiful job 😃😍🤩😇
This one actually made me tear up. Bless your hearts you lovely ladies for giving little Sally a chance to live her best life<3
Aaaw 🥲❤️❤️
What a cutie
Congrats on 2m+ views in 4 days. This is the best story I've ever seen on the Dodo.
Well done．👍👍👍👍👍💪💪💪💪💪🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I don't know how I got here but it made my day. Thank you❤❤
so cute I hope she ok
That is seriously the most adorable little runt of a dog. She so deserved all the love and care she received to be able to live her life.
This is consequences of crossbreeds ... There is always some kind of disabilities...
Absolutely spectacular
this is the most amazing heartwarming journey I've ever seen. sally is a precious angel with amazing guardian angels watching her.🥰😍😭😭😭😭💖💗💓💞💕❤
Lemme tell you, this little puppy knows how to tug at heartstrings
SALLY GIRL HEALING HANDS AND FAITH, CARE,LOVE . HOD BNLESS TH I S LITTLE GIRL HELP HER TO BREATH. AMEN..🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙂🙃😉🤗🌹🐶🐾💐👍😉🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
💜
Omg, she is too cute. I want one!
Good people do great things
She's beautiful... ❤️
Wonderful story ❤️🤗
I imagine having a box/tank in the room with high oxygen in it would present high risk of explosion too.
So frikkin adorable 😍
The best of humanity
Kind of surprised someone didn’t try to build her a little oxygen mask/helmet.  It would have meant carrying a tank around, and so wouldn’t have been practical, but for getting her out of the bubble and interacting with her, it would have worked.
All this for a dog???? Come on !
So is she a  dachshund?
So heartwarming! This is the good stuff that we need in life! Love and perseverance for the smallest of lungs! 💖
Beautiful story 😊🙂👍
She is so beautiful
Can somebody please tell me what the breed of this puppy is thank you
This MADE MY NIGHT. <3
Awesome! Thank you to the angels 😇 💕 💖 💛! Beautiful story ❤️!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Oh my god she is the cutest puppy ever!!! 😍
You Go 'BUBBLE!' 😄 😃 😀 😊 ☺ 😉
WOW, never knew possible, or existed. God Bless You, and 'Baby.'
Such a wonderful story. Thanks for sharing.
cute little weenie dog. i love you sally
Sweet little Sally! Suffer no more! Healed and loving this awesome world she lives in! You took great care. I hope all pets in your hands gets to be as well! 😊❤🐶😍
I rarely cried for a dog video. Not this one. I feel for the little girl. Im just so happy seeing her finally happy!
Ninjas cutting onions
The people who worked so hard to keep the tiny puppy alive are angels indeed. I wish I could express my admiration to them personally. Their dedication has touched my heart.
To the person who shouted "EMMA" I thought you were shouting to me 😀
Above and beyond….AWSOME
Poor little thing.
You are a very special beautiful person and all those involved in the special care Sally needed gave her so much love and patience. God bless all of you.
Sally is adorable and a fighter
No pets! That's so sad. It's unfortunate that the oxygen chamber wasn't rigged up as a glove box so the caretakers could pet the pup from outside the closed chamber.
The effort theses wonderful caregivers put into bringing this sweet puppy back to health is truly admirable. Still, I think it should be the responsibility of any breeder to put the same effort into any puppies they choose to bring into the world. It is completely unethical to only invest in the puppies that you can quickly sell for profit, and then to pass off any unhealthy ones to someone else for care.
Sally 8a the sweetest girl I've seen in a while. 😇🥰🥲🥲
What kind of dog is she ?
What a wonderful story!  Two great homes that gave her a chance!  What an adorable little girl!
Off topic but pink compliments her fur colour so well, so pretty
make her run on a small wheel or treadmill. that will sort her out
Love to the people who fought for Sally and to Sally for her wonderful spirit ❤️❤️❤️
Wonderful rescuers and sweet miracle dog, but I also hope the breeder investigated the causes and ensures there isn’t future issues with their breeding. Some issues can be from bad crosses, premature delivery, or poor nutrition of mother during gestation
Thank you to all involved. ❤
god bless all☺❤❤🙏🙏
This is such a precious story. Sally is a fighter. I’m so happy she has y’all taking great care of her. She is living a happy life ❤
Isn’t it dangerous to have that much toys in the living area? I feel like the dog could suffocate. Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.
How lovely!! She's absolutely adorable
She’s so precious 😭
Your making me want a dog
❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😇😇😇😇😇🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🐶💚🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️

How do I become a person that can help like you guys?   I cry everyone I see one if your videos I want help and be a foster parent to many animals
Cutest little thing ❤️
She’s waddleling 😂
She so cute I hope she’s doin ok
Those breeders should have been arrested! Bless you all for saving this adorable puppy.
I know the park is its right by my house omg this was in my hometown
OMGGG 🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
A breeder than will not do everything to look after the puppies they breed should not be in the game and this lady should have named them so hopefully people wont buy off them and they have no choice but to stop breeding altogether.
What a beautiful story! And what an awesome little dog. I love dachshunds. I have had four of them. 🙂
What a beautiful story! And what an awesome little dog. I love dachshunds. I have had four of them. 🙂

😭😭😭😭💙
What kind of puppy is she
Cutest Thing I have seen today, thank you Dodo for this beautiful  and adorable video of Sally
SHES SO FRIGGIN CUTEE
Stop this is too cute. I would not have been able to adopt her out-
Wow this dog is so cringe, imagine not being able to breathe.
She’s so cute ☺ 🥰
Such patience, commitment  and love paid off wonderfully !
You guys are amazing ❤❤❤ Sally is a fighter.
my heart melted <3 she is adorable
God bless the caretakers for this fur baby.  I imagine they are already blessed seeing this wonderful little doggie survive and grow.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Bless her I wish I could have her she is soooo cute and sweet 🐺💖
I ❤️❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍🥰❤️ this channel thank you 👍🥰
❤️😘❤️😘🥰❤️🥰❤️🥰❤️👍🥰👍🥰👍🥰
I’m not choosing what is wrong or right but from observation and experience in my own country. I live in Africa and many of the black girls in my school would love to braid not only each other’s hair but other races hair. Hair has meaning to everyone and if you feel that way then ofc you should say something . But also look at it on other terms hair styles should be embraced and accepted and treated with respect from their place and culture of origin. Appropriation goes beyond just wearing something it’s more how you act wearing it.
This baby is killin me 😭
What a determined puppy. And it's so wonderful for you being in her rescue parent
I think it's better to name her Bubble 😊
What a wonderful story! Thank you 🙏🏼 ❤️
this is one of the greatest videos ive seen. God bless you all.
❤❤❤❤
Thank you Romans 10:9
It’s People like you two that make the World a better place to Live in….Have a Beautiful Life Sally
WHEN THEY WERE IN THE BACKYARD WITH THE BOUNCY HOUSE THIS RANDON GIRL WAS LIKE EmMa
What caused her pneumonia

Most adorable thing I've ever seen
This made me cry but good thing sally survived and got adopted by a great family and meet new friends :)
Such a sweet precious little Angel ❤
Her chewing the feeding tube: she's a little confused but she got the spirit
There goes the opportunity to name her Bubble…
I need sally.
Look at what we go through for a puppy to survive, but people don’t mind killing a real human being in an abortion process😢.  If you don’t want your baby give it for adoption to a good home, don’t abort.
Poor dog. Evil human. Would be more humane to put her down
Cute pup glad she doing well
Cutest puppy, we hat a little fighter!
Wow, her snout got so long! 😁
Absolutely PRECIOUS!!!!
May God bless you abundantly.  Bless her precious ❤️ 🙏
Ah man! I HECKIN love @thedodo! I've watched hundreds of not a few thousand of the dodo videos some even more than once and they just keep getting better and better ... Honestly tho this video right here is way wayyy up on my list of favorites .. why you might ask? Because it's ... It's just an awesome story..! Tiny cute as a button fluffy puppy that not only beats but freaking smashes the odds... How is this not everybody's favorite video? It just goes to show what happens when you to fight really hard to live even the simplest life... There is nothing on planet E A R T H stopping this really tiny and really cute and really fluffy bestest doggo .. NOTHING!!
😢😢😢😢😢🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️💃💃💃💃
What a heartwarming story about people who care about each individual animal.  We need to hear about these things in this world.
Id have to buy a UPS.   We get power outages 2 or 3 times a year
She 100 percent wouldent have made it
i like sally a lot!!!!
I experienced pneumonia but luckily at a very small level and it was horrible I had lived with Asthma before and this was worse I couldn’t imagine how this dog must have felt
♥️♥️
My homie got one of those " he keeps it in a bubble too. Not because it doesn't get enough oxygen" because it sh$t all over the house! So he puts the fu$ker in a clothes dens 😂
OMG I NEED THAT PUPPY RN SHES TOO CUTEEEEEE
I'm so glad she had an oxygen chamber on hand, if it were some random cityfolk im not sure they would have one
Bless you guys. Seriously. Wow.
Thanks to all who took part in giving  this precious pup a second  chance at life . God bless all of you.
the amount of fight she had to live in a tiny little package is amazing
OMG I love her<3 Thank you!!!!
The puppy is so adorable!
This is warming my Heart
OMG ... The Dodo has done it again. I'm not a dog person at all, but I absolutely fell in love with this beautiful, little soul!
I do want to thank the breeder, though, for actually finding help for her and not just tossing her in the garbage like a lot of them do. She's such a sweet girl. Thank you for saving her.
This pup could not be any more adorable.great work guys xx
Xo
It’s so cute🥺 I hope she be okay!
Bad breeders..
So great you helped her!
Yep it's a dogs life , she has the best life ever and appreciate it.
OK BUT SERIOUSLY WHY IS THAT PUPPY THE CUTEST THING EVER
You LOVELY LOVELY LADY!! It's people like you that put faith back into humanity Xx
I’m so conflicted on what dog breed this girl is.
What breed is she?
That is the most adorable dog I’ve ever seen I’m not even kidding
OH MY GOODNESS SHES SO CUTE
❤❤🙏
The moments when she came back into the bubble of her own accord because out of breath were both the saddest and most adorable thing in the world.
So happy she can live her life without staying in the bubble
It must be so satisfying to adopt an unwell animal and then see them nursed back to health a few months later.
Wonderful story!
Aw, I just want to adopt her!!!
Being dependent upon supplemental oxygen myself, this one really hit home. Sweetest little puppy ever and both the Foster & Adoptive Moms are awesome.
So much love for the baby. My god bless all these people and prayers to Sally.😍🥰😍
She so tiny 🥰
Sally has to be the absolute most adorable cutest special little puppy in the world!!! My heart melted with her in that bubble!
Brought Me To Tears Just Shows With Some Time And Love Everything Has A Chance God Bless Yall For Not Giving Up On This Precious Baby Girl Words Can't Explain How Much Joy It Brings My Heart Seein Stories Like This And I Hope Everybody Has A Purrrfect Day 😻
(This is a sad but very beautiful and heartbreaking moment that makes you really want to get a puppy)
So beautiful!
I WANT HER

She's not a bad girl. She's the goodest girl. Arf! Thank you for saving this little one. That's some impressive patience and caring.
Sally is so smart. She knew when needed to go back into her bubble. I love dogs 💖
I believe what you have there, is an itty bitty pupper.
Sweet
Sweet thing
If you're looking for God,, look at gifts like this.
What kind of dog is this? I love her
The home she went to is amazing and she will be treated like  a little princess. You guys are amazing and these victories are what must keep you going.
SO CUTE!! Thank you so much!
Oh Lord! I just love what you did here!
She said the doggo said “ my lungs 🫁” 😂😂😂😂
This is such a sweet story. My heart is smiling!!!!
A story about a dog that had a problem but now she’s a little angel with a family we love you sally❤😊
👍🏻❤❤❤❤❤
How adorable.  Thank you for saving her life
Wow she’s so cute and the dedication given to caring for her was amazing I’m also pleased she got a loving kind forever family ❤
I don't really like dogs...   But THAT IS ADORABLE.
This literally warms my heart!! I've had a love for dachshunds for over 30 years, and I'll never have a different breed as my personal pet! They are truly hard-headed and determined little things, which is why that sweet girl just kept on fighting! But they are also very affectionate and loyal and perfect lapdogs!
Hell ya all weeni dogs
shes soooo cute omg 😍😇💖💖 I want to adopt a puppy now.
I'm a strong believer if you put the love, compassion and time into something that is precious as this sweet little innocent creature, anything is possible.
You have this pup life. Thank you. I sincerely mean it. Thank you.
oh my gosh thank you thank you thank you for saving this baby girl!!! Thank you to anyone who cares for those that need some extra help and care <3 <3
Makes my heart full to see a happy puppy ❤
YAY Sally!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is me having to come out of my bed
Humans who loves and saves animal are the most beautiful thing!
So many breeder horror stories. Adopt. Don’t shop, ever. Don’t support breeders.  Also. That’s just about the cutest damn pupper I’ve ever seen.
Thank you for caring and staying by her until she was strong enough.  She is so adorable.
Heartwarming. Thank you.
So precious
so heartwarming I wish there were more like you out there, so  many would have  just said no you said yes & did all you could. bless you
Did she outgrow her asthma?
Did yall monitor Abg's during this or just eyeball the gums and paws ? You are truly angels....we were put here to do Gods work...god being good ORDERLY direction...
Oh my goodness! Too precious!
Can any pls tell what breed of dog he is❤
That vet is so pretty
She is a survivor and you guess are her heroes. Bless your soul ❤️
did the docs take a look at her lungs thru out this process?
I always wonder, how people have so much time, to invest into animals.
HVALA BOGU I DOBRIM LJUDIMA,ZDRAV LEP I DUG ZIVOT😘🙃🙂
This is one of many reasons you go to shelters rather than money grabbing breeders!! Being around cats/dogs I find for me no matter the SIZE or BREED if there's a connection you're in love! Not just keeping to certain breeds and types! You just click!!!
Would be so hard to not be able to,give her cuddles
Fisherman/heroes 🥰
Thank you 😊
Shivbaba bless you all🤗
OMG so cute 🥰
I think this is cruel to keep a puppy alive like this..when its not necessary. Why. For our own entertainment.
This was a Beautiful story. Made my day. Thank you all for sharing! ❤❤❤
She is so sweet, so kind and cute!! Thank you beautiful souls for taking care of this little angel!! You are true HEROES!!!!
Thanks for taking care of her. She’s living a wonderful life 🐾
Well this is exactly the kind of medicine I needed today I'm very hurt by a person that I tried to help for many years they disappointed me and I was upset but this really helped me feel better cuz we all struggle but in the end persistence pays off so thank you very much

Another angel 😇  helping a fur baby. Thank you for saving her.
My heart...
Oh my gosh! That baby is so precious.  Sad for her to not breathe.  She made a grand recovery.  Thanks to all that helped her live and breathe.  She has her whole life in front of her and a wonderful family to be with! Awesome watching her swim! 💙🐶💖
Poor little baby girl. Thank you for not giving up on her. Maybe work out some gloves to go into the chamber like in labs?
😭
Cuteness overload!
Omg that dog is just so precious.
She's amazing! Such an adorable little girl! Thank you so much for everything you did to give her a good quality of life, she's thriving because of everything all of you have done for her. 🙏❤️

Beautiful story!
Laughed and cried simultaneously throughout this entire video.  She will never forget that you didn't give up on her!! What a true angel.
Godbless
I love stories like this, and these wonderful Beautiful women who cared for her, and loved her, and are giving her a wonderful life. Never giving up on her. So much love, patience,  and care. You people are magnificent 🐕🐕🥰🥰
With all the unbelieveable cruelty  going on in this worl, my heart is broken. This made me smile. Thank you for being there for this little scrap of life. Thank you.
Thank you for saving this baby dog
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It would be so easy to say this pup isn’t worth the trouble and to put her asleep. Thankfully she was cared for by an Angel on earth. Thank you to the woman that adopted her as well. 😇
god bless these beautiful women and everyone like them who takes care of and gives love to all the animals who were told they didn’t have a chance. love always finds a way❤
i had a sally that stuck with me for 16 years. she’s gone now, but i’m so touched to see the story of this little sally wally.
Aww!  She’s so tiny! Baby steps for sure.  What a wonderful family for her.
This dog is a warrior.
Grabbing the toilet paper and trying to get her dress is so cute 😍
Sally is one of the many strong dogs Psychologically and mentally proves without a doubt the full definition of 'Practice makes Perfect'
So cool.
Seeing Sally progress gives me a big smile. 😃
thank you for taking care of this sweet  sweet baby. she looks wonderful!
A lot of people and professionals would have said as soon as she couldn’t stay outside the bubble for a few seconds to give it up.  It was the dedication and tenacity of these women that saved this cutie pie.  It would have pained me so to see her gasping for air.  They did not give up even though I’m sure there were times they doubted their own efforts would save her.  Bless these angels.
I know she is called Sally, but for me she will be Bubbles!
ADORABLE
Το πιο όμορφο κουτάβι ευχαριστούμε πολύ που το βοηθήσατε 🥰😽🐶❤️💐 bubble puppy
I live pitbulls so much they're such big babies very emotional dogs
Beautiful story thank you for the happy tears:)
Pochita needs a hug
I miss my puppy 🥺
Thank you, you beautiful earth 👼 angels.
Keep fighting puppykins.
Looks like she’s in the best hands
Thank you for your human kindness
Hope she gets stronger and feels better soon.
Remarkable story.❤❤
I would adopt this doll and call her bubbles.
She's a puppy doodle and she's adorable I'm glad her lungs got stronger and now she's free. Thank you so much for taking care of her❣️🐶💯
Precious baby
She’s like a little machine 7:20
Really like the work done, creativity and the intent to create a full life as she recovered.
2 DAY LATER A CHICAGO COP SHOT THE DOG SAYING," I WAS IN FEAR OF MY LIFE" AND GOT 30 DAYS OFF WITH PAY!!!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Now that's dedication Much love
Congrats on no give ups nice job chechens
GOD BLESS YOU ALL
So the person breeding put her into this world, but couldn’t take responsibility for her when she had special needs, so someone else had to do it. This is exactly why you do not buy,  but adopt!
Aw whaT type of dog is she??
What a sweet girl ❤
Like I said in my previous statement let God be with this little baby for all time to come
Let the good Lord be with your bubble for all time to come
she’s adorable!!! so glad no one gave up, including her!❤❤❤ living her best life
🙋‍♀️ Is there a way to put in a small doggy door flap opening so you could put a hand inside the bubble for petting for the next time?
Omg she is so cute that's awesome they could save her
Baby being adopted and loved by her new mommy 🥰😍💖
Beautiful
What's not to love. She's a dachshund and they are strong will.
Oh god, I wanna cuddle this puppy so hard, to adorable. Brb need to go punch a baby and fix an engine to get my dude membership card back.
ALL I CAN SAY IS A TRULY PRECIOUS LITTLE SWEETHEART. AND YOU BOTH ARE SO WONDERFUL FOR SAVING THAT PRECIOUS SOUL. 😇🥰😍💛💚💙💜🤍
SHE SO BEAUTIFUL. THANK U 4 SAVING THIS BABY 💖

Get well little one, much love ❤️ ❤️ 😍 to you
She is adorable
Thank you so much for sharing this story. When you think your life is tough, you see this little pup and realize that life is precious and you should enjoy every moment. I think vet techs are not recognized nearly as much as they should be for the amazing work and love they give every day.
Omgosh. .you guys are the bestest best. I  ADORED this piece on LITTLE bubble puppy. Thank goodness she MADE IT...so  rewarding  as well.bless you guys.
Hear me out, I want to spend a long weekend in the bubble. Preferable with the puppy.
Happy ending to a sweet story !!!!
What breed is she I need to get thattt dooogggg :(
I think if you have this problem again all you need to do is try to look for like those human bubbles but like in a pet version and put it on her and then you could take her out I don’t know if that will work
Adorrable puppy.  Sadly its a Copied video.
Amazing! Thanks so much 🙏
The most cutest puppy I’ve ever seen 🥺❤️
Thank you a trillion times for having the patience and love on taking care of the dog. God bless your hearts🙏♥️

Thank you for helping her to  survive her weak lungs !! God bless people like you !! For me you are a hero !! Greetings from Lillian from the Netherlands 🌹🇳🇱👍🏻
Things like this make me love humans again
Thank God fir people like this lady, may she be blessed beyond measure.
My question is, what kind of breeder can't take care of the animal they bred in the first place? lol
That puppy is dangerously cute
A life time of future problems for this pup.
Why do I want to be in a fluffy bubbly now
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Beautiful dog….beautiful kind people.
Amazing
Damn, those ninjas cutting onion. I need this kind of dedication in my life. Thank you.
Power of LOVE
I'm really glad that the breeder gave her away insteed of Killing her/giving Up on her.
Such a sweetheart and so smart. 😊♥️
This made my morning 😍
Unpopular opinion: breeders are assholes, they only breed dogs for monetary profit
Fantastic story.  The will to live is strong.  Every animal needs to be given the chance!
This is humanity at its best a good example for a world class care for life all life.
Because of people like you I’m still keeping my faith in humanity.
So lovely
1:24 " a ton of blankets" that seems a little excessive. Im no expert but 10 to 25 lbs of blankets seems sufficient. super cute :3  the end was amazing what an awesome doggo
😭😭😭I feel so bad for her but thank you for saving her keep going Sally✊❤🐶
🥲❤️
You know something, this feel GREAT STORY came at very hard time in my life... I am an animal lover and dogs just are my absolute favorite... Sally is just absolutely ADORABLE and I am so glad she has found this loving  home... I can see she will never want for anything... Good Life Sally, you little darling... You have made my day!!!!
Miss Sally ❤❤❤ That suits her perfectly. Adorable!
I have always loved dogs, and now i have my first forever puppy, a yorkie. This is inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time. I love this so much. I cant spend a moment alone without my dog
What a mom ...what a mom..
When they switched to a larger cage, I was chanting to my computer:  Somebody go in the bubble and cuddle her!   And then they did!  Made me so happy.
That is what humans are here for!
People like this are angels.  She’s a beautiful dog
OMG.... I just  love her. 😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍
I'm really happy that you the people who didn't put their hope away from a dog like her if dog can speak she would be thanking you til the end
Thank goodness for you 💕
OH MY GOD THE WAY SHE WADDLES IS SO FCKEN CUTE
sally: A WLOE NEW WOLD
All those shots of her struggling to breath, I could not watch! 😪
This is unconditional love.
Did you ever take her to a vet???
Dachshunds are the most amazing breed on this earth. Such bold personalities & so smart! I truly do love them so much.
Sally is such an Angel, and not just a sweet one, but a tough fighter, and fought through her problem.
You are so sweet. To not be able to touch her little face would be so great!!
Fuzzlet.
Isn’t she the most gorgeous and determined baby you’ve ever seen?
Patience and love 💕. So powerful.
Bubble Puppy's mom and foster mom are angels.  Thank you, sweet souls.
She is SO FREAKIN ADORABLE 😭😍
this video made me cry in joy for her.  thank you for being such wonderful human beings saving her!
I don't think I've ever cried during a The Dodo video before now
She's soo adorable ; - ;
She is so precious 😍
OMG I love her
She's so cuddly ! Cute puppy !
Thank you rescuers.  Fuxk breeders!  Adopt don’t shop!
I love this doggo. 🥲🥰
This little furry angel hit the jackpot first with her caregivers, and then an absolutely fantastic adoptive family.  Alas, after a difficult and traumatic early childhood, she certainly deserves a life of love and family.
I was bawling my eyes out the entire video 😭 this sweet little baby went thorugh so much, and she made it, she is a miracle. Thanks to her caregivers, they are true angels
Im crying
Damn lady. Only a saint would go to this effort   Thank you
Goosebumps. Hardly any words to say how wonderful you people are for doing this. Thank you.
Now , I know what to do for animals like her with breathing problems.
Omg shes the cutest puppy ever
oh my god sally is the cutest bubble girl ever
This is amazing but I think that the person with the bubble should of kept her😢
I had to come back here. This little angel makes my day so much better!
Idk how people foster them let their babies go I couldn’t do it. I’d have 1,015 dogs in my house I’d be a hoarder of dogs haah
great job young ladies getting this sweet girl back on her feet
Sweet pea 💞
Amazing :)
She is real cute plus brave Bonnie knows what they went through so many kind people in the world I need hope in these times
This is very sweet story and a wonderful pup and family, but are there human children who could use someone "loving up on them" too? Can people do both at the same time?
what breed is this puppy? its really adorable!! just curious tho
Bless you
That vet tech has a boatload of dogs lol
What a sweet and beautiful well behaved girl! I wonder how potty training went for her!
This woman is my hero  I'm crying but I'm happy
.. how amazing to watch...just not the mad struggle of the puppy...but also this lady who is truly a man of God... greetings all the way from Singapore 😍😍
What a cute little baby!
Poor puppy 😭 i wouldn't have money for oxygen but I'm glad you were able to afford to save her life
She is such a precious, innocent baby....thanks to you & all who saved this Angel's life!!! 🥰🥰❤❤😘
What a sweet little nugget.
Heart warming ❤.
I'm so glad you got to get her on her feet and she is doing great 👍
You guys that do this are literally my favourite people in the whole wide world! Friggin legends you are!
The power and beauty of patience and love is astounding. 🥹♥️♥️
Aww fabulous, have a happy, healthy life sweetie 💗
I'm undone
You are an angel.  I salute you!!!!!!  :)
The dedication and love bestowed on this gorgeous little girl was so touching.  To see her struggle and then thrive, it’s the most beautiful thing.  You’re all angels🧡🤍.
I think it’s amazing how that lady put her time just to make sure that dog is happy and living.. it was so worth it. I used to have a dachshund with heart problems. He actually lived much longer than his vet expected. He lived till 13 years old and passed away November in 2020 RIP My woofie
What remarkable women and what an amazing little pup. I love this story.
Such a beautiful story!
So many people would say give up but not you and I respect that
omg i just love the happy videos  like this i have a blind and deaf puppy that shelter was going to be putting down and i walk the dogs there so i said no let me take her and i will train and raise her she is the smartest one of the 5 dogs i have she fills the vibration of floor and know what time it is for everything,,she walks on leash and the other dogs help her stay in order in line
I wish I had one of those oxygen tents.  A while ago I was taking care of 4 newborn kittens, and bottle feeding them every 2 hours around the clock.  No matter how hard I tried, I still lost 3 of them to Fading Kitten Syndrome.  Fortunately one of them survived, and now my other kitty has a best friend for life.
Thats pretty amazing….
BUBBLE BUDDY
Remarkable little girl precious pup.
Do k-9 have asthma?
Do k-9 have asthma?
What a remarkable story of a human angel and the blessed little baby put together by God for this miracle.
IM NO CRYING YOU CRING
what bread is she? She is so cute ❤❤
IM CRYING 😭😭😭 Doctors would of given up...but they didn't!!! I have I little more faith in humanity😂
shes so cute look at how small she is I want one!!!!
Thank you all for helping  Sally she is a lovely Little Lady
She is precious!!... Thank you for your love and care !!!!!
I hope they have safety measures in place just in case she would need oxygen for whatever reason. But this story is really sweet!
So why did I cry throughout this whole story?!😭😭😭
Don't veterinarians have oxygen masks for little animals, maybe she could go out for short times, with oxygen mask and oxygen tank
Wow she made it
Did you have to take her out to clean her area,and her blankets and dolls?How did she strengthen her muscles?
Wow. ❤
She’s so cute
Seeing the tears in its eyes 😭
she looks like my dachshund the two colored eyes exactly the same as mine.  Idk if my wiener dog had the white spot because we got her when she was 6 years old. But keep making videos this awesome!
Her eyes are so full of wonder
Im so glad shes alright
I wish people would stop putting clothes on their animals because they clearly don't like it!
tears in my eyes. 💜💜💜
👍
We need more people like this woman on this earth
That is so adorable I love how these endings turn out ❤
30 seconds have passed... 1 minutes have passed.... 5 minutes have passed... Soon Sally would be to move indefinitely outside of the unoxygenated environment and I literally cannot think of anything but Dio saying he would eventually be able to stop time entirely and I just can't.
Sally’s my tiny hero(ine).
That is such a beautiful story with the puppy and the people all so very lucky to have each other.

This channel is at least 90% of the faith i still have in people being more than selfish survivers. Tysm for caring for this special needs life. Because that what all animals are, they are life. They breath, they have a pulse. They love and they feel. They are at least as important as each and everyone of us are. Thank you.
She almost drowned from milk, she understands water and breathing don't mix.
I was so confused in the thumbnail I thought that dog wasn't real but I was wrong SHE LOOKS SO CUTE AS A PUP AND SHE STILL IS THE ADORABLE PUPPY TILL THIS DAY!!!
Poor little pal. I hope she can visit children's hospitals and share her story with munchkins.
❤️❤️
I just love that little one, dogs in general..all animals but I do have to say....Adopt dont buy. There are so many dogs/ puppies sitting alone in shelters. Thus puppy git a chance. I understand why people want to breed but for most it's like a side job. Leave that for dogs with predigrees and responsible owners. Put puppy mills and home breeding out of business.  Before anyone gets angry...look at what happens behind the cuteness. Sad. This baby melted my heart though. Happy to hear success stories from the many that aren't.
Thank you for saving her!!!!💕
THE DEDICATION SHOWS there’s humanity left
That is the cutest freaking dog I’ve ever seen!
Thank you for doing that - she is an angel
Sally hermosa❤ Dios te bendiga  siempre🙏
OMG THIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL  LITTLE  LADY EVER 😍 💖  THAT CUTE LITTLE  FACE SAYS IT ALL ,LOVE ME LOVE ME LOVE ME. ❤️  HO BOY THEY ARE GOING TO BE  FIGHTING  OVER HER FOR SURE CONGRATS TO THE LUCKY  NEW PARENT  OR PARENTS.  😇🥰💞💞💞💞💞💞🧡🧡🧡
my heart is now a puddle
I'm glad she could breath again, took months to work out
How heartwarming ! Love her, she is very special. Thank you for sharing this.
What kind of dog is Sally? She looks like some kind of a spaniel/terrier mix to me but I might be totally off base. An adorable (and strong) puppy regardless! EDIT: Maybe dachshund? Seeing her grow up makes me definitely think she's a weiner dog!
The cutest little bean
Why are those officers impeding that Dinosaurs and movement
Such a cute little dog, what breed of dog is she?
this is so loving wow. I'm amazed. Thank you Nurses for this wow :O !
Truly heartbreaking and heartwarming video bravo beautiful Sally you made it and are going to have a wonderful life thanks guys inspirational
Oh my god she is precious
Amazing story of a brave n beautiful dog but more importantly the people that didn’t give up, continued dedication and love that pulled her through 🙏💋God bless you xx ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wish this was an option for my puppy, who passed away in August but passed away to lung failure.. 💔
We really love DoDo videos! This pup is absolutely adorable! The patience,care, empathy, sympathy and Love put into her care.. Truly Outstanding Ladies! She's a beautiful baby &a smart girl too....So pleased y'all do what you do!
OMG! She is just precious 😍
I'm sobbing. Look at this dog
“You see purple dinosaur?”     Me: barney is a dinosaur that lives in our imagination
Bless her little heart! What a sweetie!!! Thank you for taking care of her!!!!!
😊aww so cute I love it
❤❤❤
Poor baby glad you took care of her. ❤
She's as smart as she is adorable; and a real fighter! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
She's a feisty fighter! Thank you to the caretakers and her new family for giving her a chance to live a normal pupper life!
Never give up on animals, they are stronger than humans😂
if only I could put 0.5% of this woman's dedication into building my life I would be the richest man on earth
So wonderful!  What a beautiful story.  She is the best and most loving little girl. Thank you for showing the many that saving one life is worth everything.  Bless you.
She’s so cute! What’s her breed?❤️
Jesus is coming back. To be saved repent of your sins and turn from your ways to be saved. We have the opportunity to live forever. We must trust in Him alone. We are running out of time. Look around! Make your decision with fear and trembling. For any questions please ask.
❤what a truly amazing couple to take care of this beautiful baby. Thank you so much for all your hard work and sleepless nights. There is a special place in the world for you😊❤
this is such an amazing story! thank you guys!!
Aww shes adorable and great job!
Sally is way too adorable for words 💗💗
What kinda breed is she she’s so cute that’s a dachshund
I'm not crying, it's smoggy here! I don't think I've ever seen such an adorable dog, well except for all the rest of them. But Sally is one feisty, lucky little pup. What a great job they did in healing her lungs. May she always remain safe and loved.
What a cute little fighter!  Well done poochie & people for not giving up.
What did you do different with her vaccinations if anthing and how old was she when you began to introduce the outside world e.g. park, dog park, pet store?
If THIS doesn't put a smile on your face by the end, there's something seriously wrong with you!
She’s so sweet! I hope she ends up okay emotionally, poor girl needs people and a mama and siblings, though of course that’s infeasible in her situation. It was smart of them to make the big chamber and to take the little chamber around with them!
That is so adorable I cannot breath- 😭 I love it 🥰
I'm so glad she's determined with her dogs like she is with her kids. Nice 😊
She's so cute
💜
God Bless you all for taking such good care of this furbaby! 🙏
Beautiful.
So cute
This warms my heart...what a sweet and precious little fur baby...she's so adorable!! 🥰❤️ Very thankful for those wonderful vets that saved her life!!! ❤️❤️❤️
💙🤗🙏🏻
❤️❤️❤️💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
Little Miss Independent
Amazing love
15/10 😊
Thank you for doing all this for her you are much appreciated
What breed of dog?
A lot of people would have put her to sleep forever but this woman and her family never gave up on her! God bless her and everyone that never let the puppy go. I hope they all live together happily now!
Sally is so cute and funny 😭
she is so precious and has such a determined personality. thx for not holding her above a tub of water!!!!!   thx for your heart and love
🥰😙 Awe precious wittle Poopling❣
Who's cutting the Damn onions
What an adorable puppy! Such wonderful, devoted people!
The cutest puppy ever so adorable
Thank you for your devotion, compassion and love! 💕💕
Beautiful amazing sweet baby... Thank God she had you
There are no words enough  to say what a kind loving heart it takes to do this for an animal God-bless you... you saved her life.   Sweetest baby.
This is remarkable,it brighter my day! 😊
How stinking cute is she!!! She made my day so much better and even got me to sub to the dodo lol.
She's adorable but I'd haven't definitely given up on her unless provided with her bubble
The passion and heart you all put into what you do is so heartwarming. May God bless you all
I can only imagine how much joy and love they got from this little amazing creature that God created. I will always love her even though I have never met her. She was a gift and I hope that they all remember that. God bless
Gosh, what a sweetie. You are lovely people. <3
Thank You for all you guys do!! It is fantastic to see the progress she made. She is so beautiful.
Heartbreaking in the best way possible :) <3
OMG!!!  She is so cute. I wish I could have her. Love her already. What a special little puppy.
Just goes to show the power of love!
That is the cutest thumbnail I've ever seen in my life omg
1st of all I wanna Salute the Lady for her hard work,Love & Extreme care to keep that tiny cute Bubble baby.2nd I’m not saying just because she was sick?but I really never see a true fighter and cute!!!Puppy like her.and also know that keep her inside that chamber with 24/7 oxygen supply wasn’t that cheap?but you show us all that money is not everything.I’m saying that because during COVID 19 pandemic I saw videos that  so called humans left their own family members on the roads alive,just because of the couldn’t or doesn’t want to pay for the expenses to refill the oxygen tanks?but here you are an angel 😇 who prefers the life of that tiny poor souls life over money.MAY ALMIGHTY ALLAH PAK BLESS AND PROTECT YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES.AMEN.Lots of love ❤️ and Respect from Pakistan 🇵🇰.because you are the best and kindest Lady I’ve ever seen in my entire life.😘💚❤️🐶👈✅👉💰❌👍👌👏👏👏🥇🎖
“From a breeder” do you need someone who is just pumping out puppies for money? A true Breeder provides health testing and they don’t give up on their dogs they would never produce an unhealthy dog like this. Don’t pin this unhealthy puppy on true breeders.
So cute❤
Really cute and interesting, but kind of a waste of money...
How did they clean and feed her inside the bubble?
So that's the new rarest rarest little doggy I have ever seen and it looks cuter and 🥺🥺💗❤️🥰
Thankyou
Had one like this :) she spent 4 months in her incubator ❤ she only ate wellmade.
This woman is a saint and that poor baby!
Aww honey I am so happy that you are getting all the help I’m sending you all the prayers that everything will be safe and I hope you have/find your loving family and forever home ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
We all need someone who trust us and our journey
This is the first time I’ve cried in a while…
Body: NOOOO!!!! You can't just survive without oxygen!!!!! We need to go back to our bubble in order to survive!!! Dog: No. **Proceeds to survive without the need for oxygen**
Breeders are a scourge.
i miss my puppy ;~;
I wish long happy lives to any one who never gives up on saving an animal
oh mY GOD THAT DOG IS SO CUTE I CAN’T AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
It pains me how everyone is crying about that dog. Sure congrats to that woman for keeping it alive but then again, it's just a dog. No reason to cry over.
my heartt
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🐶🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Growing up alone. Tough beginnings.
Big THANK YOU to everyone who contributed to her survival! ❤️
So cute and spunky. Yay for you all and Sally!
She is a beautiful angel!!!  I am so glad she is living a great life!!!
Breeders caused this to happen to this poor dog. too much inbreeding. Avoid breeders, rescue dogs only!
It is so wonderful to see humans take such good care of this little puppy and give her a chance at life!❤
Such a miracle.🙂 I just hope that would happen for my dad cause he was really sick and couldn’t make it so he died and went to heaven😭🥺😭🥺😢😢
She might be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!
Her dedication is truly amazing! I've cared for sick pets/animals before but not like that. She's an absolutely wonderful human being and I'm so grateful for her!!
This just gave me my yearly dose of Serotonin.
Fun fact: "Bubble Puppy" was the name of a psychedic rock band in the late 1960s! 🤣🎸☮️
There's a forgotten band from the 60's called Bubble Puppy. Their hit was "Hot Smoke and Sassafras". I'd name the doggy Sassafras.  Sassy.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
To all the people who were involved in Sally's healing process all i can say is "God bless you all"
Adorable, someone scratch her belly for me please
God's most amazing creation with PURE love are dogs.
Surely she could have initially  got like a baby incubator so that you could handle her and lovingly stroke her….
So cute
Love, Love, Love this story! ! !🤗💜🐕‍🦺
Is Sally a full dachshund or dachshund cross?
Oh my gosh… what a insanely beautiful story… my faith in humanity has restored temporarily…
I love her ❤
So much energy question though how where they able to feed her if they couldn't open her bubble
👍
I would have loved to take her!!!
Fat big mama in a fat big car. How I hate americans!
Wow, a dachshund puppy.  She is so adorable.  We have one and love our Skye so much.
omfg shes so cute
How precious is puppy.  Thank you.
Thank you for doing what you do 👏👏♥️🙏 this beautiful Puppy♥️💕♥️😁 now has a lovely life 👏🙏🙏🙏🙏
2:40 ya'll not seeing the big dog's nail!!!
I love when owners allow the dog or whatever animal to choose their own toy
I love how sally puts herself to timeout😂❤ *dies of cuteness*
What a great family to take such specialized care of this little puppy
💖 this was incredible. The dedication that went into Sally. We need more people like you, and everyone else we see on here doing remarkable things for animals. 💖
too adorable. giving life a chance is quite an experience in'it? :)
POOR BABY
Que guapito ese perrito ❤️
This is what living in a bubble really means
What breed is that??
❤️
Praise the lord for those involved in the care of this precious puppy. Miracles do happen.
I live with my brother, and he rescued a dog from a kill shelter years ago. He had an abusive owner, then got heartworm and was scheduled to be put down... The treatment was expensive. The time spent to get this terrified pup to trust humans again was long and trying... This amazing dog is about 9 yrs old now. He's a husky/shepherd and we don't know how much time he has left. But he's had such an amazing life since he was rescued. He's SOOOO happy! 🥰
she is so cute!!!
What a wonderful story love you guys for this one❤️
Beautiful love story.  Compassionate patience brought a happy full life for a very fortunate pup
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
What a beautiful story
Cutie, cutie 🥰🥰 Amen for her recovery! Thank you for giving her loving care.
That puppy is so cute
What’s her breed?
in india we have a state kerala where people kill every animal that moves including dogs,its a hell for animals 😭😭
BUBBLE PUPPYYYYYYYYYYYY
this dog knows her limits better than i do-   -someone with severe asthma
Thanks for caring for vulnerable creatures/ pets.
Just wonderful. That precious little darling❤️ The dedication of her carers is  phenomenal. God bless them and darling Sally, she is just🥰🥰🥰🥰 and that waggy tail,oh my heart❤️ I have never seen such an adorable little angel. This is so beautiful!! And what a gorgeous home she has now.❤️🇦🇺
God dammit I cried 😭 , the caretaker is a hero!
Pure breeding is evil
Beautiful!!! Glad she survived!!!👍🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🌈
To all of her caregivers, THANK YOU!  Beautiful puppy and people. None ever gave up! Thank you for sharing and would love to see more, please! 🐕😊💖
She says: “This is the BIGGEST Water Bowl I’ve ever seen‼️”🤣😆😂
💕 LOVED EVERY SECOND OF THIS VIDEO!! Thankyou for posting❤
You're amazing!
Stoped people African people doesent even have food while you spend a loot of money on a puppy dog
Such a shame this probably happened because of breeding. Dachshunds are not healthy dogs.
These is Chinese propaganda
2:43 geico--
There is a special place in heaven for people that care for animals.
Oh my goodness that puppy is so flippin cute I love herrrrrr❤❤❤
🥰💗💗💗🥰 absolutely  precious.
What an incredible & inspirational story. Bless you all for the work, dedication & love you gave sweet Sally. What a privilege to experience this remarkable story.
Too much oxygen for human babies makes them go blind.
🙏 ❤
Katherine, dear girl, you did such a wonderful job of getting Sally fully well and breathing like any other dog! Bravo! And just look at her now! And aren’t you so lucky that you still get to see the little darling, even after she’s gone to her new home. Win win!❤️🦘
This shows animals want to live and survive as well. All they need is people to love and care enough to help
Love this story so much. I want a little dog so bad but I can't, because my schedule is horrible and wouldn't be fair to one. But, l love stories like this. 👍🏽
The love you gave saved this little cutie 💓 💕 Yhank you 💖
That’s really remarkable, so happy for Sally❤
She is ADORABLE!!
What a legend, the definition of “never give up”
a wonderful story,thank you for uploading.❤🇦🇺
Thank You She is so adorable . You people are awesome your patience and compassion helped this precious little puppy ❤💐
Kl story
That dog is so damn cute bro.
🥺😭😭😭
Is so cute❤️
breed?
Her dedication and love has a grown man in tears.
What a sweet angel u guys are god bless you 😘🥹
The woman who saved this puppy is an Angel. I fell in love with that little baby girl. It’s so good to see positive things in our world, and this was beyond that.
She looks like my puppy before… My Light was black with a white mark on the forehead. His back legs was a bit long and he had an odd way of walking. She is adorable! ❤❤❤
she is so cute omg
She is just adorable 😁
This is so sweet, so caring. Loving.
Soooooo süsssss
If only quality of life was at THIS level in the whole world so that the sarcastic part of my brain could just shut up, f//ck off and let me watch the video in peace:(
This is so cute 🥹 she is so tinyyyy
I am glad that the animals have people like you guy's to help them out in their most time in need to help them get better so that they can live a long life. Thank you for this video.
Omg when she was crying at the door of the bubble broke me
My heart is over the moon for this puppy she is so adorable aww happy she is ok
Thank you for being this beautiful animal's guardian angel 💗 she is so beautiful and adorable. sending lots of love ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So happy for Sally and her recovery...............
Awweee, this story is so motivating and inspiring :))) It was absolutely lovely to know the progress and the lady is amazing! Bubble puppy looks so adorable and beautiful ! So lovely, God bless all of them ^^   Just wanna share that God loves you all! Please accept and believe Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior by believing He died on the cross for your sins, that He rose from the dead, and by confessing your sins to Him. He is faithful to forgive you and will not force you to do this for He just wants to let you know how much He cares for you. God bless everyone :)
Please always be extremely careful when handling oxygen and oxygen rich atmospheres. I work at a chemical plant and let me tell you even an increase from the normal 21% to 30% makes everything behave like matchsticks. Just for your information, they likely handled it very carefully.
Thank you for saving this darling special baby. You are amazing women. How awesome is this!!
My Heart ❤️
Oh god she’s so freakin cute.
😭😭😭
Girl is strong 💪 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you for being angels to the helpless. You made the world a much better place.
You are a very pretty lady and God Bless you for caring  so much ❤️
That was precious
She sadly passed away
0:43 cute doggo face 4:50 nod nod
HAPPY TEARS
What I cannot stand is the tail wagging. Regardless the situation, the tail is keep wagging. Sally is so adorable
Alot of people and vets would have let her pass away, and I'd understand why, but I'm glad she had you, had someone willing to take the steps to keep her alive.
She is so cute❤ To the rescuer of this little angel....Thank you for saving her👍
Beautiful! I've struggled with asthma my entire life, been called lazy and worthless my whole life. I'm glad this puppy has people to help her enjoy life. Warms my heart!❤️
Thank you for helping her. Truly, thank you.
Beautiful pup
Need to get some glove arms for the bubble.
هي كتير نغوشة  She's  so cute 😍
Aaww
That is the cutest little puppies i have ever seen. She’s so adorable😊
I didn't know there was a way to save a puppy that's aspirated on milk. I'm so happy to find out about this!
This is a great one!
"She came down in a bubble, dawg!"
NG😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾💯🕊️🤍🤍💯🤍🕊️
She is beautiful little fighter ♥️💕❤️
🥰😍🧡🇳🇱
A regular vet would tell you that putting her down would be the best course of action as it would put her out of her misery. I would agree with them myself as I have seen the effects on dogs that do not get the interaction needed during development. My dog wants NOTHING to do with you unless she wants attention, if she does not, bugger off. She hates other dogs, she also hates water. (Like being in it, she will drink it no problem, even when she should not because it is a bucket that collected rain water and has become stagnant)  She loves snow, but i remember the first year with her snow terrified her, so i suited up and went outside with her to show her snow was okay. She fell in love with it, because of development she got as a puppy.   Sally, living in the bubble will have missed out on a lot of this social and behavioral development. Like the whole interaction with other dogs.  Sally however was determined to do it. She fought for her life outside the bubble. She wanted it.
Just some friendly knowledge. If you smack her butt when shes going crazy she'll stop acting so wild.. if she doesn't stop, try a light kick... if she tries to nibble or bite, just give her a nice hard smack on the nose.. If she deficates in the house, just smack her on the ass 3 times (but no more than 3) and then rub her nose in it, and say the words "DID YOU DO THAT?" then give her 1 more smack and say the words "NO!" .. Hope this helps, I've been training dogs for years..
I cried!! 😭😭 this is too beautiful

We do that with patients who’ve been on long term oxygen therapy or a ventilator. It’s called weaning. Much like it sounds, we gradually decrease the amount of oxygen. When on a ventilator, they have periods where they trigger all the breaths, then back on full support. It strengthens the lungs. Glad you didn’t give up on the peanut.
This is the best I've seen from this channel. What a great story. I'm so happy for that little girl.
What a wonderful story, thank you,🐶
Is Sally a Dachshund or a Chihuahua?
Cute doesn’t just do her justice. Precious! All of the above. ❤️
Please normally I don't feel anything when watching these but I generally really love how cute she is like I'm smiling so bad rn
I have COPD and get pneumonia easily .. as a human being fully understanding what's happening and still panic when I can't breathe ... A little baby puppy going through it is just heartbreaking.. may she live a happy HEALTH long life bc she deserves it!
This is one of the sweetest babies I’ve ever seen!
Omg I woulda lived in a bubble with her. 🤗❤️
Poor baby 😦 total blessing to have outstanding people take care of her. God bless your hearts for sharing this with us.
Never give up
This is one of those things you don't know you need until you see it.
What a little doll
😭😭 so precious!
Oh my god you are such kind humans, god bless you💓
She adorable.
*Thank you n God bless you beautiful lady🤗😘🙏🏻❤watching from Indonesia🇮🇩*
Snuggle Friends (stuffed animals) are SO critical in a healing compound. I still have mine from  previous cases.
What an amazing story.  It warms my heart :)
Yeah that's right.." She is just an angel "
shes a precious little thing
A heartwarming story of love and communication, and commitment. Bless you.
Dachshund?
I really wish people would stop breeding, get a real job! This is going to keep happening there's thousands and thousands of dogs available for adoption ffs!  So glad this one made it though❤️
I feel so bad for a adorable puppy even though I am scared of dogs but I feel bad for the little baby's being sick 😔
The amount of effort & dedication these ladies put in to save her is really impressive. This video was 10 minutes of pure cuteness, and her precious face didn’t change from when she was a puppy 🍀
So happy for you guys, so glad you were able to provide her with everything needed, the patience and the constant fear of them nit recovering would be nerve racking,. It is a great story appreciate you sharing. 🙏
this made me SOB shes so adorable
You know a dog is happy when you can really feel it through the screen
There must be a ninja chopping onions in here.
She's  so beautiful
Tuvo un empiezo muy duro pero con ayuda hasta ella pudo mejorar y ser una perrita feliz.  Me alegra mucho ver como mejoró y tuvo a su familia... también cuido mucho a mi perrita (teckel o daschund). 😉👍
Imagine having to hold your breath every time you want to go outside. What a fighter, a winner, a miricle!
Wow good job, she's such a sweetheart 🥰
❤🙏
thank you for not giving up!!!
Thank goodness for kind hearted loving people like this, who care for these animals. Anyone reading this may think I'm stretching it a bit, but I'm not, but these animals will Eternally love these people for caring for them while on Earth.  That's the truth.
She's adorable
I found a baby kitten in my neighborhood under a car. Poor boy was anemic with a pale nose and covered in fleas and dirt. He was so tiny and looked almost lifeless. I already had a cat and a dog but I couldn’t leave him so I took him in with the intent of nursing him back to health for adoption. I fed him, bathed him, spent an hour picking fleas off his body, brushed him, fluffed him, gave him a place to sleep and slowly but surely he got life into him. Only problem was I grew so attached to him that I couldn’t let him go so I took him permanently as part of our family. Four years later, Frankie is a mama’s boy and a sweetheart and I love him so much.   I would do anything to care for these sick animals and I’d keep them too if I had a bigger home.
Such a precious baby! ❤
i cant ! to much cuteness to handle
My heart was breaking for her when she was stuck in the bubble and she clearly wanted attention. Poor little thing, a growing baby who can't even socialize with her human and puppy friends. Seeing her out of the bubble and living and normal happy life makes me so happy
This dog is so pure. I love her!!
What a precious story this is kindness on the top level, she  had the right people at the right time.  Amazon car hop trays.
The best story. You mamas are the best.
She's a dachshund. They have very high spirits.
What a cutie. How sweet. She is a beautiful baby girl, full of spanking and life. ❤️ 😍 💖.
I hope she is protected always and lives a long, happy and healthy life. I can already see how much she is loved
Her little tail wag is precious
Sally is sooo cute .so awesome that u gave her a chance and now she's thriving so beautiful

What an amazing dedication! Bravo to this woman ! ...Just stop dressing them up though, can't be comfortable at all for a dog to wear a dress .
That little fur baby is so precious.
This one really touched me, I’m so glad she recovered. She was happy her entire life and she’s so lucky to have met such wonderful people that never gave up on her

That's one of the nicest things I've ever seen.

How could anybody hate or hurt dogs they need to be protected
Keep her in the bubble!
bubble puppy from the hit show bubble guppies irl?
This reminds me of ironmouse 🥰
This is so cute
Why do breeders still exist?
Lord Vader... Can you hear me?
God Bless you, for saving  this lovely little girl. Adorable 🥰
These videos make me so happy
Amazing career
thank god for people like you!
❤😊
Dog is not suppose to live in a bubble. I'm glad she can go for a walk outside and leave the bubble completely.
Omg such a lovely and cute puppy.....
That’s so neat
So glad the breeder gave her to someone who could help her
What a strong little puppy. Her lungs is getting better and better. ❤️‍🩹
ooooommmmmmggggggggg 😍😍😍😍😍😍
It would appear this dog had some kind of asthma and until it became more active, it finally had the strength to independently breath without trying.
God bless you ♡♡♡
Amazing movie
I so happy there are people like you. Sally is priceless
How much did it cost to keep this one puppy alive?  You people know a Children's hospital could have probably used that money right?  It's kinda sad how much we spend to keep animals alive when children are dying but I guess I'm just team people...and you guys prefer dead children to this stupid puppy.
So, this dog knows you as her mom and she knows her adopters as her pack.  10:08
Awesome vid
💖🐕🐾
Video: .. oh btw geico
I’m really happy she’s doing well. What a cutie pie Sally

I Will go nuts see dog must be in encolser cause of condition
🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
pochita!!!
Sorry little one I hope you are good now
Sally is such a strong beautiful puppy! Congratulations on your recovery, you lovable furry miracle! 🥰
I'm soo glad that you were patient enough and smart enough to figure out how to help her. Sometimes just like us, animals just grow out of it and need time. My puppy had narrow intestines and could not process solid foods properly so we had to give him more fluid ones. Then one day he just grew out of it. I was allergic to all milk when I was a baby. I would have severe allergic reactions and had to drink prescription preparations from the doctors. Now as an adult I eat and drink everything. So sometimes with a little patience and when you are informed by the right people and circumstance, a baby can overcome and reach adulthood. We just have to try and not get discouraged. 😉Love, love,love🥰🥰🥰
such a sweet baby! such a beautiful ending 💖🥰🐾
I know you're experience l understand the frustration.  God bless you guys for the patience to heal her. Hearts of gold 💛 💕 💞 for you guys
Great story ! Thanks for sharing.
Adorable🥺
She's like a fluffy sausage dog 🌭 loool 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Oh my god, u guys are like the kindest person ever, god bless you 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
This is why I hate breeding. You only see suffering. It’s heartbreaking. The breeders would never fight for these dogs they always give them to people who would.
You all did one heck of a job with Sally,  she's one of the most adorable fighters I've seen. 😍 Give her a hug and a kiss for me!🥰😇
Too cute
I pray for a happy ending and that she has a full dogs life and is going to be able to play both indoors and outdoors take care.
i get that the breeder didn't anticipate this little pup's problem but still.. it annoys me that people can just get rid of a dog because they "can't take care of it". you brought that dog into the world! if your child was born with a defect you can't say 'nah i don't want it', i hate that it's "acceptable" to do that with animals, it's not fair. you want to be a breeder, you MAKE it so you can look after the dogs, end of story.  that mama dog and her pups have no say in this, getting rid of her babies because YOU can't look after it is so unfair.
Is she a longhaired dachshund?
look what love can do! How awesome!
Such an amazing story of her survival, with the patience and  the care her pet mom gave her to live a happy healthy life. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼♥️
This is the cutest stinkin little baby dog I've ever seen 😭
She reminds me when I was a kid. I had bad asthma and had to frequently go to the hospital to be stuck to the nebulizer. but I outgrew it and strengthen my lungs.
I’m so glad she made it to you guys! Most people would’ve given up on her! ❤❤❤
These women are real heroes! ♥️
Wow extremely awesome bless you guys
Sally, darling, the best life for you! ❤️ 💜 💚
What a beautiful sweetheart that baby is precious
You guys. Have my admiration. Thank you for posting this story and helping me smile for today.
She's so precious!! Glad she made it through :)
I’m so glad she still gets to see her foster mom who saved her life! I often wonder if animals remember their fosters families and miss them even though they find good forever homes. Sally has a wonderful spirit! So happy this sweet soul is still in the world.
Awe, bless her.  ❤️🙏
What a sweet baby.  Thanks for all the love and care you give her.❤
That's my girl a real fighter
Best dogs deserve the best humans ❤️
The baby 😊
What a little sweetheart! The love she received has absolutely let her love her best life!
Dinky dog ❤❤❤
Massive respect for the vet tech who raised the pup. That's basically being her God. I had no idea this level of extended intensive care for dogs was even possible. I'm stunned. In a society overcrowded by jerks and idiots, we also have literal angels like her. Major props to the little one for being smart enough to live within her limits as a child. Most humans don't have that kind of self-control. Overall, this is an incredible story.
such a strong lady 💖
Kathryn,you can keep me if you want 😊
You actually really shouldn't let her jump, Dachshunds have such a long back, that they can slip a disc, and become paralyzed. That's why you see so many Dachshunds in wheelchairs. & I am guessing she has Asthma? I have Asthma, & Ik what it's like to not breathe.
She is adorable thank God she made it, she's a little fighter.  Thank you to all of you for not giving up on her, you are all amazing for the care, love and dedication towards these precious animals ❤️
❤️
She so beautiful 😍  she a fighter 😍  sending all good 👍 vibes her way
YOU HAVE TO BE FREAKING KIDDING ME THAT IS THE CUTIEST DOG I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE OMG OMG OMG OMG SOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE!!!!!!!!
😢🥲🥰😍❤️👍🏽🙏🏽✊🏽
She is precious how cute, so heartbreaking at first. So glad she made it and survived. Oh goodluck!!!☘☘☘☘
I'm sure she's in a good home, but why does someone who apparently has many dogs already has to adopt the cutest, most adorable, precious little puppy. I'm jealous... so jealous.  But happy for her
Sally is a miracle and a cutie for sure!!!  I am so glad that she found her furever family!¡!!😉💗😉💗
\○/ Jesus
This video really warmed my heart. Thank you for being the kind of people that will go to these extremes to save a precious little puppy!
Finally Sally lady puppy no need for bubble oxygen   Was adopted by a good owner
The dear doggo was lucky to have a foster Mum, who cared so much.
I'm so glad she made through to the other side. Such a happy baby!
She is soooooo cute
Wow…. That was the sweetest story….
So happy she had such a caring foster mom who went above and beyond for her and her fur ever family who loves her so much! God bless everyone involved in giving this sweet little angel a wonderful loving life
Thank you for caring
I'm not crying, you're crying
Thank you for Davy her life!
She is so stinkin cute!
So cute that toilet paper!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love is patient🌹Love is kind♥️
Bubble girl 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
So nice!
I needed this today. I really needed it. Slept most of Sunday away then this afternoon things went sideways. I needed to see this kind of joy and story of bravery.
YAAAAAAY.
So glad they never gave up on her! She's a fighter and such a beautiful lil soul. 💛
Yes, Sally, YES❣
Sally is so tiny but she's a survivor. This was the best story I've seen in a long time. Thank you for sticking with her and saving her. Beautiful Sally
What strong, brave little lady. First taste of a new world, no stopping her. Pure dedication,  thankyou.
A lovely story with a cute pup.  Best bits were her doggy jumpers and playing with toilet roll; made me laugh.  Also a lovely pair of ladies who looked after Sally.
Omg near the end I wanted to cry watching her give lovies to the lady that saved her as a baby! I wonder if she knows it’s her.
Awesome recovery with lots of love!!❤
🥳💖
Beautiful
IF I WOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF MISS SALLY MYSELF                                           I WOULD HAVE KEPT HER TO JOIN MY FAMILY.
Cute pup and interesting story of how much effort went into getting her more healthy.  I hope that she has been spayed, though.
My last made me feel like I would never love again
A little wiener 😄
Sweet baby
Bless the beautiful people who were clever enough and dedicated enough to save this sweet little soul!
I have extremely bad asthma i cant imagine what it would be like living in a bubble but at an early age i knew the panic at needing to reach or find an inhaler because i couldnt breathe, so thank you for being such a caring human and never giving up.
Madam, you are an actual living Saint. Thank you for you.
Beautiful baby girl so cute!!!
What breed is she she’s so cute
She is a tiny little miracle.   And she is so sweet.
Awe she is just a little cutie!! So adorable!
What breed is Sally ?
I need to see something. So adorable today ! Life is good too !! Thank you !!  We love her ❤♥️♥️♥️♥️😂😂😂😂😂😂
Adorable look her !! So pretty little thing!  Welcome to this world 🌎 for good 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🆙🆙🆙🆙
I love puppies.

The story of the OXYGEN DOG HE IS A STRONG CUTE LITTLE PUP
What an adorable little puppy!!!
Never ever, ever give up on these babies ever..I love them so much
Such a little adorable fighter! 😍 Always trying to explore her world while wagging her tail.
Adorable thank you for patience Sally just needed those lungs to catch up.  Go Sally Go swim vest not afraid of Big water just lityle pool water😅💞She is happy baby free to play run adventures.👍🏽🥰
♥️♥️♥️♥️
This was insanely cute
Ok, I've seen so many contrived videos with regard to animal rescues that my BS detector goes off pretty quickly.  This is *not* one of those cases.  The feeding tube sutured to her nose, the central line in her neck and the oxygen bubble were a reality check.  The weaning from supplemental oxygen was as real as it gets.  I spent 23 years as a nurse in a Pediatric ICU and have participated in the care of babies that have gone through this.  My hat's off to you and your team that cared for and continue to care for this puppy.  The results are nothing less than astounding.  You have every right to be proud of this outcome.  Her survival is a testament to the high quality and skill of the care you gave her and the caring of you and all your team. Very good work.    This video absolutely made my day.
Love u baby girl godbless u 😘 💓 💖 xxxxxxxx 🇬🇧
You guys are amazing so happy for Sally ❤
Brilliant ❤I loved this little dogs journey to a normal happy life🙏🙏🙏
What's wrong with her legs?
Just like a breeder, doesn't really care about the animals because they're to busy worshipping money. It's disgusting how many people are animal flesh peddlers.
Awesome 👍🐶💕✔️
🥰❤️
Such a gorgeous little girl. Love, love, love. 😘
there go those onions again
So happy to see she graduated from the bubble to being outside! She is adorable!
So happy for her  God bless her
see her fighting to breath, and then just being a happy little dog , i think some people are just angels sent to help have a happy life sally
Thank you Dodo for sharing this! Thank you young lady for fighting for Sally! We need more people like you in this world!
Tan linda 💖💖💖💖💖Love you ‼️
Smart dog. I loved my dog dearly but she wouldn't have been smart enough to stop playing and rest or go to the bubble as a puppy. She would have played herself to death. Thankfully Sally is cooperative. I've been alive for some time now and this is the first time I saw so much money and effort put into keeping a  dog alive. No average person would be able to do this sadly. You are to be commended, ladies.
Omg love her ssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooossssssssssooooooooo much my nana works for cara rescue dogs and I love hre
Im glad the puppy ok
Crying before football. Yay.
Thanks so much for taking care God bless you
Wouldn't mind adopting both Sally and her caretaker haha 🙂
So sweet of you and Ima keep her and you all for her prayers.
What kinda breed is sally? she is gorgeous ❤
...the charming dog now has a Life!
I'm not crying you're crying.....okay we're both crying
You guys did it for this tiny adorable creature, Respect.
Keep Doing What You Are Doing!! Much Love!!!
she needed to be out of the bubble to work out all of them organs
❤
She is absolutely gorgeous. I think im in love. Also i love that her new mum got to see the process and also has vet experience. So she is in the best hands
Oh, I just loved this story and all of them, but this baby was  and is just amazing and wonderful. My heart just did flips everytime she'd advance another min. To watch her go from the bubble baby to the precious bundle of joy she must be, just melts my heart. Loved seeing her pick out her first toy and camping , when she was swimming right along and loving every minute of it. My husband and I have taken in so many baby's until his death and I  had to enter hospice care, even though I live on outskirts of town so this is where alot dump their baby's when they
Yaaaaay!!! Sally's lungs healed perfectly.  I thought it was so adorable when she run back to the bubble when she needed oxygen. Such a smart cutiepie🥰💓
This is a amazing story that I enjoyed so much
So cute
She knows she is so loved! What a precious baby! 🐶❤️
🙏💪🤩😍🐶🤩😍🤗🙏💪
What a fighter she is... She wanted to live her life. Thank you to all involved in her care, it was beautiful to see!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭this broke my heart  ohhhh thank GOD FOR ADVOCATES ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤oh this sweet baby, thank you for investing the time and love ❤️this video had me just tearful!! To watch her progress was so phenomenal and heart warming😭😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Such a beautiful story with a beautiful ending...and yes...I'm crying.  ❤❤❤❤
A lot of vets would’ve said she couldn’t make it but these lovely women never gave up on her and she never gave up! Love this story!! Never give up!!
I´am not crying, i swear😭😇
Cute puppy
What commitment, lovely story.
Well ! my heart are still stone cold, but for a while it was just a lump of butter on a table on a hot summer day.
Am I the only one crying the whole time watching these type of videos. Such a cute lil doggo
An angel  ❤
Goodness gracious I am crying in my coffee! Happy tears of course! Thank you all for taking the time to helping this little angel to get better and have a happy life! What you did for her was awesome!❤
LOOOOK HOW CUTE
Why are people so weak.. should have taken that puppy, dug a hole and put one in its head. No pain, no memory of life.. just mercy.
My Lord this Woman is Gorgeous.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I could cry 😢 so precious very happy 😅
Sally is something special! I needed this 🙌
What breed is this amazing pup? I want one just like her!
This makes me think of the movie Bubble boy. 😆
Oh my my, what a ridiculously adorable little doggo Sally is 😍 So happy to see her have such a good life and that she had people to care for her and support her when she needed it.
These are people who deserve real respect.
God bless you ❤
0:46 "... to where she was ADOBTPHB." Why Dodo? Why do you have to cut-cut-cut sentences like this? Is it to reduce time? How much time did you save with that clusmy cut, 1/10th of a second?
Thank you for taking these extraordinary steps to save a life
I needed to watch this first thing this morning!
She is wonderful. She is precious. We have had up to 5 mini long haired dachshunds at one time with 3 of them rescue adopted. Absolutely love her.
She is such a fighter, sweet sweet Sally. God bless her and you for taking such good care of her. :)
She have a very strong fighting spirit and she won..nice to see she's in good health now..enjoy your life beautiful girl🐕❤
Precious wittle baby girl I’m glad she graduated from the bubble 🥺😍❤️🙏🏻
OMG. What you have done.... 🎩 off. God Bless ya..
wauw that was an amazing rescue and recovery..my aunt always had pekingese dogs and they also struggled much with breeding with also having their tong rolled up in the throat..so I know for a dog can be really hard to understand
league of legends players trying to live again after destroying their mental state
Breeders can't love and take care of the creatures they intensively breed.They just can sell them...This job needs special people...
This could possibly be my favorite Dodo video ever, and just think about the ground that covers.
does anyone know the breed of the other dog ar 7:38? it looks lot like our rescue mutt
I'm waiting for the Seinfeld jokes...
I just love this kind of people
the irony, a dog knows when to get air but the store worker in the dog store wearing a mask suffocating....humans are trully the animals on this planet
Would be amazing to see some of the money that gets funneled into saving one purebred dog get spread out to help save some of the less adoptable cats and dogs that get put down left and right at kill shelters 😔
I was happy for her..and cried so many happy tears for her...
Luck puppy 🐶
She is so cute! love her personality!
Amazing amazing work ❤
😥💔❤‍🩹❤
Sweet furry little angel 😘
Love this story!!!
So cute ❤❤❤ That why people in bali choose a purebred dog and dispose of a local dog😢😢😢  I, as a rescue dog, especially local dogs, ask for your support so that local dogs in Bali get a proper place.
I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry. I'm...alright, I'm gonna cry. 🥲
One thing I just don't understand is why dog or animal lovers allow the dog in the front seat without a tether or seat belt.  I mean, you claim that these dogs are part of your family yet you have them in your cars unsecured.  You wouldn't do that to a child so why your dog?!  It is so dangerous.  One accident and that pooch is in bad shape. You put in all that effort to save her but then take chances like that.  And almost everyone does this.    Why?? 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
funny how so much effort is put into keeping something alive because something is deemed "cute" women are extremely shallow
Precious 💗
Oh my goodness...what an absolute beauty 💕🇬🇧
As someone who also struggles with breathing, I totally related with this little beauty. It is wonderful when people refuse to give up on an animal, too often they decide it's not worth the effort.
I love when she shakes her head and it makes her fall over 😭
THIS WAS THE BEST VIDEO I have ever seen on the tube. Thank you.
This is by far my favorite story on this channel. I'm so happy she has a loving home. ♥️💋
Love you Sally,  and your humans
Best story ever
What a sweet baby girl
WOW what a little fighter, so glad she made it and found her furever home.
What a cute doggy.  Such a beautiful story.
Another winner!
5 min in I knew she was going to be adopted by one of her colleagues'  😆
She's so cute I'm screaming I'm so happy you took her and she's ok! Also more oxygen bubbles need built in gloves!
So much love and respect for the team for their love n dedication for Sally🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️😂
I am speechless. This is one of the best videos ever on so many levels. Thank you all for making this little miracle happen.
Sweetest darn thang I've ever seen
It just gives me a little hope that humanity may survive with animals all around us with beautiful trees, flowers, grass, and clean water when people like these two care for our planet.
I'm not crying you're crying
😍😍😍
i think this honestly shows that love and care can actually heal
Beautiful story, beautiful fluffy girl.
❤🥹🥲🫂🙏🏽🫶🏽❤️🥹🫂
Survivor girl Sally. At the last part she said thank you to her foster. ah
I would of adopted her too. Blessed doggie for sure.
Also I googled triumphant and perseverance and I’m still not sure if they mean the same thing or not but if they do well you got the best of words.🙂
It's awesome that the puppy is willing to fight to live
You go Sally girl show them what you're made of tough little hot dog
What a cute and precious true and triumphant and persevering story!🥹😍😘🥰🐶🐾❤️💕🫶🏽♾

That adorable little girl really wanted to live.  She was not giving up and thank.  For a puppy in a bubble she got a lot of attention and love.  This is a really beautiful story and the woman who took such amazing care of this little pup has a heart of gold.  This is definitely a little miracle dog.

Omg, I'm crying, what wonderful people you are! You just want to pick her up and give hugs and kisses. Best wishes Bonny and your people and puppy dog family!! 🐶💖
Tearing up.
Lets talk about fourfooted beasts and idolatry.   Exodus 20 KJV   [1] And God spake all these words, saying, [2] I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. [3] Thou shalt have no other gods before me. [4] Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: [5] Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.   Prov.3   KJV [5] Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. [6] In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. --‐---------------   If you use your indoor fourfooted beast for protection, you are committing idolatry.   If you praise your indoor fourfooted beast more than you do God,  you are commiting idolatry.   If you are giving your indoor fourfooted beast more time than you do God, you are commiting idolatry.   If you and your indoor fourfooted beast go everywhere together and are a "thing", then you are commiting idolatry.   If you spend more time training your indoor fourfooted beast than worshipping God then you are committing idolatry.   If your indoor fourfooted beast is your best freind, then you are commiting idolatry. God should be Your bestie.   If you clothe or accesorize or paint your indoor fourfooted beast nails, you are commiting idolatry.   If you got your indoor fourfooted beast certified as an emotional support animal, you are commiting idolatry.   If you consider your indoor fourfooted beast as your child, your are commiting idolatry.   If you tongue kiss your indoor fourfooted beast, you are commiting idolatry and beastiality.   If you treat your indoor fourfooted beast like a god or human or replace God or a human in any way, you are commiting idolatry.   If your fourfooted beast disrupts you from meditating on God in any way, you are commiting idolatry.   Lust brings the fourfooted beasts inside. Repent.   Romans 1  KJV   [21] Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. [22] Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, [23] And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible , and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. [24] Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: [25] Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. -------------------   Gods children turned from him to idols and indoor fourfooted beasts and such. God gave them up to uncleanliness, guilty of original sin again. Because they worshipped and served the creature more than the creator.   The punishment for idolatry is eternal damnation.   The remedy is fervent faith and repentance. Unrepentance is unforgivable to Jesus.   On the turning away from God.   2nd peter 2  KJV   [18] For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. [19] While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. [20] For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. [21] For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. [22] But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.   Blaspheming  Against the holy temple.   1st corinthian 3 [16] Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? [17] If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. [18] Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.   The only unforgivable sin in the bible.
She is just adorable. And I got lost in a mix of smiles and tears during the whole video.
💕
So happy for her, i'm so glad she made it! She's beautiful& special ❤️💝😇🥰🌈 pure love😍
Wow her care taker is incredibly patient
Am i a bad do thinking it's a little afford for a dog?
🥺🥰
The most adorable story ever. She's a sweet and feisty little girl and absolutely and absolutely precious. I'm so glad these wonderful people nursed her to health in this great family adopted her!!!! ❤️ 🐶
Thank you for what you do.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Okay totally not balling my eyes out over this little angel
She's the cutest little thing 💟
Thank you!! 😢
Omgosh si adorable
You guys who fostered and adopted her are amazing!
Oh, she's a dachshund! I couldn't tell when she was tiny.
Isn't it against the law to be that danged adorable?❤️
Oh I am so proud of you Sally❤️❤️ and thanks to the humans too
😢
Gorgeous baby!!!! 😍
😢😢😢😢
This is an amazing story! My hats off to the vet assistant who had so patiently treated her with so much love. So incredibly inspiring. Thank you and God bless you! 🙏🙏💗🧡🐾
I wondered how LONG total was she in the bubble for?
Adorable little sweetie ❤️❤️❤️
She’s so sweet.
Omg what breed is Sally??
Cuteness overload. Look at that tail go
I can't even fathom doing all that work to rehabilitate her, and then giving her up.  There's no way I could let her live with someone else after all that
Thank you  for all you do to you and your team
It's a shame you don't have gloves built into the walls much like NICU in hospitals to ensure O2 was steady and you can touch and feed her without risking the loss of the vital air supply.
When world met Sally
In thumbnail, it looks like Powhatan with it's tongue outside.. & happy
What a beautiful story. So glad you take the time to love and care for her ❤❤
Does anyone know what type of breed she is? I would love to adopt a cutie like her xD
Little astronaut doggy so cute.
Miss Sally, what a champion to us all !! The love and care she got, she will return for years to come ! God bless you little girl and thanks for showing us to NOT give up ! Life is so precious to us all ! Love and live long ! Thanks for sharing and above all caring !!
Where  could I purchase a bubble such as that one?
then why didn't Bonnie take care of pup from beginning ...my thought. Thank goodness  for the angel  coworker  who did!
Bonnie's family is great for Sally. But those kids, they are perfect for Sally. Thanks to everyone for giving their all for that precious pup.
Imagine buying this puppy for $100,000
You are a HERO!!! May God bless you ABUNDANTLY!!! Much love to you and thank you!! 🙌👍💞💪😊
Never have I seen a bubble puppy and survived!
You're an Angel😇
The amount of patience, love & care from the people that treated her. Bravo!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Whoever is reading this, I hope this day will be a great day.   ❤
Awe, what a little cutie! Thank you for helping animals like this that wouldn't stand a chance to live if it wasn't for your love and care!🥰😘
Patience, is a virtue.
Katherine Langford 😍
They deserve the world god bless them and that cute little dog ❤️🙏
⬆️🥰👍💗♥️😃
Sally has the best humans!!! She is really, really cute!!!
Get her a little life jacket if  they make them that small shes gonna to be brave enough to swim on her own soon..
Aww! So happy to see her flourish! May she have a Wonderful life with her forever family!
Sally! She is just freakin' ADORABLE! They are lucky they got her. Kudos to the family who nursed her back to health. Thanks to them for saving this lovely little girl for the world.
Sally's a brave little fighter thx for helping her get nursed bk to health
🍀🍀🙏🙏🙏😇😇😇✨✨✨✨😇🙏🙏🍀💐💐💕💕💜💜💚💚❤️❤️❤️👍🥰🍀🍀🍀🍀💐💐💐
I would have called her Bubbles, she's so stinking cute. 💖💖👍👍
This is so wholesome!
She is just precious ❤️
When you say a breeder couldn’t take care of the dog anymore, yet you somehow manage it, what are you really saying? My guess is that she came from a puppy mill and they would rather put a puppy down than spend dime one at the vet on medical bills. It’s a business to those scumbags, no different to them than widgets or used cars. Thank god there are people like you to balance the scales on the love side. Thank you!
My sister to be in law is at it again! ❤️ go Kat!
OMG  I follow the Bottle Brigade on Instagram and I followed sweet Sally's journey and I was so happy to see her get better. She's absolutely precious
This is sickening. Wish HUMAN babies received this kind of care.  Give me a F…G break.
She’s so adorable ❤ I’m a dachshund mom, I have 3 seniors left out of 5 dachshunds, my oldest boy is 15 and has dementia, lost my 14yr old girl to heart disease last Dec and when these dogs are all gone, I won’t get any more…I emotionally can’t do it….I make Dachshund purse charms, keychains or figurines, I sell some and donate most to Dachshund rescues or non-profit that raises money to help with vet bills..this keeps me busy along with my little old guys..I wish I were stronger mentally and emotionally for my dogs when they pass, but I fail miserably..
Getting a little misty here.
Да уж, у нас за людьми так не ухаживают как у них за собаками.
A strong adorable puppy 😊🐶😊🐶😊🐶❤❤❤
She is a pretty little girl. I am so glad her lungs got stronger.  Sally is in a great home with a wonderful family
Warm...warm...warm feelings all throughout the story. Thank you angels on earth for not giving up on  Sally. Without you all there would not be a happy, healthy and grateful Sally today.
Some how; it seems as it is the voice -of the same person, that does all the comments.
Sally! You got better. Thank you to her people.  She really touched my heart.  ♥
Everyone that took the time and take care of sally is Angels. This story made me happy and sad at the same time
Oh my!  What a perfectly precious, teeny tiny adorable little face!!!!  ✨💖✨
💜💜💜💜
Great job caring for her!!
Oh my gawsh!!! Sally is so wonderful. What breed of dog is she? She's so cute!!!

Congratulations, Canada

SALLY IS SO  BABY OMG  😭😭😭😭
🥲
I wish they had given us literally any information on her condition. What was wrong? What treatments were done other than the bubble and exercise? Were there no ways to improve her lungs or correct a collapsed trachea or whatever it was?

🙏🙏🙏😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘
So much care and work for this lil beauty. Thank these vets <3
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMG…. What a gift,  All of you folks are so awesome!
1st508 puppy birth resuscitation. A puppy was born with blocked lungs and unresponsive. You should see the technique used to clear the lungs and save it. I wonder if this pets slight misfortune was do to a mass that hadn’t cleared fully.
This is such a beautiful video!
Thanks for sharing.  I love this story!
Que coisa mais fofa 🙏🐕🐾🐕🐾🐕🐾🐕🐾🐕🐾🐕🐾🐾🔯🔯🇧🇷🇧🇷
You guys are so terrific and she's so sweet and cute.
She has a similarly stumpy friend!
Don't dress her up it probably squeezes her lungs
so adorable..
I wonder where they live, if they're in a major city she probably doesn't handle the smog yell
oh poor puppy.. so sad!!
Blessings! She looks so much like my old dog Boots.  I have seen kids with oxygen take their tubes out and sling them around. :)
Let me guess her name is Bubbles and if she was a boy you'd name her Bubble Boy
This woman has a oxygen tank for dogs like she had a premature baby before I something that's such a strange thing to have. Even for a vet
❤
Bless your heart  Sally for never giving up,  you go girl. Ty to you both for giving your time for Sally  to fight and  have  a great life 💜
Thank you for the ongoing genuine love you have of all animals and especially the love and care you showered upon this little drop of joy. Sally just melts hearts.
Thank you for taking care of Sally.  You're an amazing group of people. I wish there where more people were like you. She's a sweet beautiful dog. Many blessings.
I’m not a fan of most breeding situations. But I am glad the puppy was given to a clinic then killed.
😍🤗
Sally is so cute 😁
how cute and inspiring! please check out our channel whenever you have the chance!
What an awesome story with such a beautiful ending.... she is a princess in her own fairytale.
She is a fighter and i hope she has a long long healthy life
Sally NEVER gave up! She wanted to live and enjoy life as so she should ! May she and her family have many more  adventures and SALLY IS WAY .TOO. CUTE🥰
33 on trending in America!
First: She is one of the CUTEST BLESSINGS I have ever seen. Thank You to the FOSTER ANGEL who took her in and took SUCH GOOD CARE of here so that she could get healthy and get to have a long happy life.
wow woman of patience, thats a real woman!!
Wow, that was a hell of a start on life. Thank you for looking after her, the patience, the kindness. Also, what a great family she ended up with. A very happy little puppy.
Them eyes and that lil wittle tongue I'm smiling so hard
Aww look at moo moo so so cute love you you tiny little baby
She’s so adorable 🥰
So wonderful you took her in. So patient and kind .
💜🌷👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Great story!
Sally is a miracle dog!!  she survived her puppy years in an oxygen chamber to being a normal dog living outside.  way to go sweet adorable Sally!!
I enjoyed this one very much 😊
Oh poor bubby, I'm SO glad this amazing woman already had an oxygen rich bubble from having saved previous  animals so this baby had a good chance. Youi can see that she was so lonely watching everything going on outside her bubble and just wanting to get involved in things.  and just look at her, how precious and perfect <3
Sally’s story would make an adorable children’s book. She’s so cute!
I've never seen a story like this one.  So sad and happy.
ADORABLE!! I WANT A SALLY TOO!@
Such a cute puppy! 😍
She's so adorable!!!
Absolutely FABULOUS 🐶❤️🐶❤️🐶❤️🐶 xxx
Such a gorgeous little sweetheart. 😍 💕
This has given me a little bit more faith in humanity.
That little tail just keeps wagging.  What an angel!
Yay!!! She has kids too!! Love it! 😊
Is she not the cutest thing ever.🤩🧡🥰❤️😍💜
fat ahh
❤❤❤❤❤
The initial caregiver of this sweet puppy deserves a huge thank you.  Without your wonderful heart and expertise, it's doubtful this little girl would have survived.  Thank you for everything you did for her.  The adoptive family obviously loves this tiny baby and will most certainly take good care of her.  I just wish there were more people in the world who care as much for animals as the caregiver and adoptive family.  💙💚💜  My deepest love and prayers to the tiny baby puppy.
It’s a miracle Angel🙏❤️
One of the most amazing Dodo stories EVER!! Just absolutely wonderful! :))
This story will forever be ingrained in my heart to keep going. Thank yall.
This is the cutest puppy video I’ve ever seen
All my love to you folks and Sally! Be blessed!
Very cool!
what breed is sally?
Awe. Just like that Deadpool movie. Can't wait to see it cuss and womanize. Like a true animal.   _I'm the toxic masculinity you're looking for._
Thank you for saying gosh, and being committed to helping this poor puppy.
Another tight video
AWWWWWWWWWW SHE IS JUST PRECIOUS ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Awe..sweet Sally is such a fighter. I'm so glad that she survived because of amazing people who fought for her and didn't give up. God and unconditional love healed her. Go Sally!!!!
Precious Sally! She is beautiful and tough. A survivor. I love her and the vet techs that took such extraordinary care of this fur baby are heroes. Compassion means everything.
Such a beautiful video ❤
Such a beautiful video ❤
Are you familiar with the The Boy In The Plastic Bubble,  I guess this would be the opposite.
Aw.
What respiratory disorder is that? Weakened lungs? I’m happy her lungs eventually fully developed and stabilized. They’re really basically like humans.
I fell in love with this little pup😍😍  She went through all that in the bubble till now😊
Oh my God, what you all did for this one precious life is SOOOOOOO beautiful. Mad respect
What an amazing history. I love it
“Bubble Puppy” was a rock band with the hit “Hot Smoke and Sasafrass” in 1969. 👍
Please don’t let your animals chew on toys in a store. They shouldn’t play with them until you sterilize them at home. You don’t know who else has had that toy in their mouth. Just like people, dogs can have contagious diseases without their owners realizing it.  Let’s all keep our pets healthy and happy.
What a gorgeous little pupperoon. Well done putting in such a big effort to save this little one.
THAT IS THE CUTEST FCKIN PUPPY I EVER SEEN.
What a beautiful story! Can you suggest where we might find an oxygen bubble? I have a little senior dog with an enlarged heart and pulmonary hypertension and he could really use something like this.
You are the reason life is wonderful and beautiful. Thank you.
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
She is sooo cute🥰🥰
Such a sweet little girl 🥰🐶🐾
You took such good care of this poor baby!  She is beautiful! ❤
Oh my ❤️❤️
People who breed dogs and cats should be shot in the head.
Breeding animals for pets should be illegal.
🙏🏾❤️, She's so BEAUTIFUL..........🤝🏾🇺🇸💪🏾❤️🙏🏾
Must of been so hard not to cuddle her! ❤️ Thank you volunteers around the world who take time out there days and precious family time helping animals around the world 🗺. Ty to vets too I couldn't be vet or work for animal charity's would upset me to much
Everything about Sally is adorable.  I’m so glad she pulled through ❤️❤️
Just awesome.
Brilliant!  What’s the breed?
História maravilhosa!!! São pessoas assim que me fazem continuar acreditando na humanidade. Parabéns a todos os envolvidos.
CRYING omg so sweeet
So cute 😊
No wonder, it's a deformed breed.
What breed is this pooch?
Out of all The Dodo videos I've ever watched--  this one really broke me down in the beginning 😢
Maybe I'm tired and getting stupid, but.. I started crying.
She is so precious. I have asthma since a baby. I can relate. When I was old enough my parents stated that they had to give away my pets and toys because of dust and dander. I literally says then I would be better off dead. No they understood and did their best. After many years of struggle I went in to have surgery on improving my sinus since it was just a thing on my face. Apparently I had no sinuses. Now I can live like everyone else with minor set backs.
Thanks for sharing the experience and journey; this was awesome!  So glad Sally and her family have a happy ending❤
Bless you all for loving, rescuing, and nurturing her to life and health ❤️♥️💙🙏💕💖❤️♥️
That poor baby!!! 💕💕💕💕💕
She is so cute.  Watch out for respiratory infection.
Such a cute pup!!!
Oh my goodness when she started talking about the day the puppy didn't want to go back in the bubble I started tearing up, such a brave little baby! She must have decided it was worth the slight discomfort to be outside and just gotten even better from there!  I would never have been able to give her up after that, foster parents are truly built different, and the world is better for having you!
If that story doesn't make you smile,  nothing will.  🙂🙂
So glad they didn't give up on her and she made it to live a happy life :)
Freaking adorable and truly amazing people.
Horrifying to see her struggle to breathe and live :( 😞 ...Precious, Darling babypup ❤️🧡💛
You are wonderful wonderful people
Being so dedicated means a lot! Pets deserve our unconditional love and care!
Amazing 🥲
Dude this chick looks JUST like Dr.Britt Baker....D.....M.....D.... Lol 😂. Amazing work helping the little one get her lungs right though, she looked so adorable it was sad seeing her as a puppy in the bubble
wow, there is a special place in heaven for people such as yourselves. Bravo!
How sweet!!
OMG. Such a wonderful recovery and loving story. Thank you for your video! And for your kind hearts!
So beautiful
Theres no way I would give her up she's apart of the family
The baby is a little fighter , so cute and precious .Thankful that they realized that they were unable to look after her and sent her to someone that could , and that was you !!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
What an amazing story! Thank God for wonderful people like you who care so much for animals!
Sally ❤- My favourite video of the year so far -
Beautiful story ❤ throughly enjoyed it
Awe she’s so precious. Thank you!
Sally is gorgeous; thank you all for working with her and getting her lungs strong for her to live her best life.
There are truly good people on this planet.
I knew she was a Dachshund from the moment I laid eyes on her, but then I saw that the coworker who adopted her had MORE dachshunds?! IT WAS MEANT TO BE, they’re the biggest pack breeds 😭😭😭
Thank You 😢tears of happiness and bless you all and Sally ♥️
I just love that she has an amazing and loving forever family. Sally deserves to be loved and spoiled and that’s exactly what she’s getting ❤. Thank God for her angels who gave her a second chance.
Omg! She’s darling!! What a heartwarming story!❤❤
What fantastic people, such a beautiful story.
This absolutely made my day , she’s a true fighter and so are all of you who helped her push thru this.
What a sweetie!  You did such a good job caring for the sick puppy!  This is love.  I am so happy that she was adopted into a loving family.  Thanks for your fantastic work for animals!
🥲💜🌻
What a tough little girl 🙌🏼❤
OMG she’s one of the cutest puppies I’ve ever seen.What a little fighter.🥰

Thank you for taking such great care of her she is beautiful and I'm glad she finally got a home with lots of love and attention makes me feel happy for her and never giving up on her.

American mothers treat their dogs better than 50% of the world treats kids.
I'm glad she wasn't given up on. Gorgeous pupper with so much life.
Lucky family.

Love concurs all.
👍🏻❤️🌻
Thank you for helping with the care of this little furry baby girl and giving her a chance. Thank you so much for your friend’s family to adopt her and give her the best life ever. This story really brought tears to my eyes but in happiness because I recently lost my little dog and I know how much love and companionship they can bring. My dog’s name was Sally also and watching this little baby swim with her life vest on was the cutest thing ever. Kisses kisses kisses❤❤❤❤❤❤
Faith in goodness in the world greatly increased ❤
That was an amazing heartwarming story. She had so much love and support from all of the people and her own little doggy strength to get her through to live a life she was meant to live. ❤️❤️❤️🐾🐾🐾🐕🐕🐕
I'm not gonna cry...I'm not gonna cry...Dammit!!! Such a sweet, beautiful little girl! God bless you all!!! 🥲👍❤❤❤
As a lifelong asthmatic, I think that I have found my new spirit animal.
I'm not a dog person tbh but this little girl makes me laugh and cry at the same time.
Wonderful story. All live deserves a chance. She is adorable. What breed is she?
Beautiful thanku for sharing ..made my day.
What a Beautiful story.  Life can make it with a helping hand.  Does life deserve to be snuffed out if it isn't perfect right after birth? Nope!  Life wants to Live!
She is adorable
Wow the patience and love is amazing. It is amazing to see her know her limits.
This story would make a great Disney movie.
Thank u
I'd keep an oxygen rich room specifically for the dog, just in case. Maybe one day she overexerts, or one day, she gets sick, or one day, shes just too old. Id rather have that prepare for her than not ;; this is beautiful
What a precious little beauty! 💖 Go Sally Go!
I love it whem no one gives up and it ends up like this
What an adorable little pup.  God bless her 🙏❤
it's so amazing every time seeing how much the body can achieve when given extra care and time of any species. Nature knows exactly what it is doing.
Cutest dog I’ve ever seen in my life 😌
Kudos 🎉to God’s animal lovers 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🙏🙏🙏🙏you did awesome 😎
She does have a cute face.
God bless you and your good works!  Rev 4:11    Anima (animal)  Life ,breath, spirit  ............. amen
You can see how much she loves life) 🧡 such a cheerful soul☀️🧡
Maravilha
Awesome story.
This triggered me to cry for a whole hour.
This was so adorable that I couldn't breathe after a while and had to be put in the bubble.
I just want to gif you all, including the animals, a big hug for everything you’re doing.
I 💜  this sooo much for Sally! She is too cute. Live long little one 😍
This is such a wonderful story!! With Sally and her strong spirit and her foster mom doing everything to help Sally and finally Sally's forever home mom and family.
She's so beautiful thank you so much 😭🙏🙏
Even though she was sick, she has such a high spirit. Go, Sally, go! She's a fighter! 💛
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Adorable pup so happy to see her life her best life ....sooooo cute 🥰
It's so sad that because of people wanting to buy animals, babies like her have to go through so much.  There will be so many who didnt make it, BREEDERS MUST BE STOPPED. there are millions of homeless animals to adopt.
She is so super cute and adorable 😍 excellent job 👏🏾 👍🏽 🙌 ❤️ 💖 👌 everyone.

K its been 3 minutes and Im asking myself if these is a second buble that can be modified for a long plastic cow butt glove to love the puppy. or making a custom bubble suit. small pup pretty easy
WOW a foster with oxygen.. never heard of such a thing.
I'm crying for hours 😢
oh what a sweetie!! and the people who took care of her are angels<33
That was amazing! Keep up the good work. Thank you for posting.
Thank you for not giving up on her and getting her healthy so she can experience life and the world. 👍🙏

I was a bubble baby. I was extremely "croup-ey" as a baby and it lasted at least until I was 12 months old. Thankfully over time the virus ebbed and I would have periods of improvement that lengthened with each cycle until eventually I came out of it. I've had a few problems as a result of my childhood problems but they have been addressed successfully for the most part. I'm glad to see this puppy is living the good life...
Absolutely wonderful.  Sally is beautiful.  Thanks for helping her to live her best life.
She"s SOOOOO CUTE!!! OH My God!!!
Can I have her? Pls pls pls!
Oh my she's so lovely got a real fighting spirit love dachshunds grew up with them AND her name is Sally not a dachshund but an English Setter I inherited...  sweet Sally was one of the best dogs I've ever been privileged to share my life with
Yes, she decided to fight for her life. And won. She is a truly warrior. Well done, sweet Sally. Bonnie & Kathryn thank you very much for not give up. Much love for you. 🥰🐶
She's so cute!!!! 🥰🥰🥰😭🥰🥰🥰
Thank you much
Sweet pickle
Wonderful ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So wholesome seeing animals get better and such, and people not giving up on them… it’s awful thinking that animals could have comebacks like this, just for them to be put down without given a shot😕
Well done best of luck ❤❤❤
❤
Incredible
You earned a place in heaven
What a little cutie so glad she grew out of her medical condition and that she is happy and healthy!
Absolute angel of a dog, I hope she lives the happiest life, full of love. Thank you to the wonderful caretakers, true show of humanity and love ❤️
That was extremely inspiring. Just when I think how evil this world is you get to see stories and people like this.❤
Absolutely beautiful 😇🙏🏻🐾💛🐾
She is precious. 💖 God bless you all for your patience and perseverance given to saving Sally.
It's a very delicate balance. She's cute as a button and is a big fighter. God bless her fuzzy heart.                         Philadelphia USA
So happy Sally pulled through with all your care and and is thriving with her family.  A very happy ending
Imagine how much C02 could've been saved instead. Now many more animals will suffer :C
Beautiful story!!! Live it up sweet puppy!💜
What a beautiful story. :)
me coming here after my blue nose pittie didn’t make it
Look at the work, time and commitment they put into this precious lil puppy. I LOVE it, you guys are awesome and she is absolutely adorable <3
Such a touching story!
You are now manually breathing.
I hate breeders ....
Apart from my own wonderful girls, (of course !) I don't think I have ever seen a more beautiful little soul. So glad she made it, and I pray she has the longest and happiest life possible.  God bless you for caring for her!
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I'm sorry Momma you had to grow up without your siblings and Mom.
How absolutely fabulous!  What a fighter.  So happy for her outcome and having a caring and loving family <3
What a fantastic for a such a very beautiful .
Thank you for all you do
I love this story!
So nice that y'all went to all the trouble to  save that little puppy.  She enjoys life and without y'all there would have been none of that for her.
God Is Good 🙏🏼🙏🏼♥️♥️
I love ❤
in recent years i developed POTS, an autoimmune disease that affects my energy level and ability to participate in average day-to-day activities. my treatment involves a lot of tiny steps to build up strength, and a lot of setbacks. i absolutely relate to the boredom and frustration of being trapped in my own “bubble”, and seeing others hit milestones i haven’t yet. seeing how determined and happy this little pup is and how she was able to conquer her illness and live a full life gives me so much joy.  to anybody dealing with something similar, i hope you nothing but the best :)
Lord please bless all those who rescue!
Bless you all for making it possible to help Sally to achieve her independence! My little one was born at a rescue & has had a host of issues including a hole in his heart that is irreparable, but meds help the blood flow.  He is a year old now and he's like a bull in a china shop!  So glad that Sally chose her "break free" moment and is doing well 🥰
Very very very very very cool sister! Kudos to you & everyone involved
What a precious little pup
Blessings to all of you!  So happy the puppy managed to heal.  Such a beautiful & sweet 🐕.  The work you do is awesome! 😁👍
Give the breeder some credit... many scummy breeders would have just killed the dog and threw it away
She knows when to go into bubble......she also knew when didn't want the bubble, that's amazing
wHAT A SWEET STORY! tHANK YOU
I'm so happy she got the chance to grow up and be a loving part of a family.  Thank All of yall for the patience and Love you have given. Shalom.
This is humanity 101
John Travolta is soo envious !! No doubt!!❤
She's a warrior, she's very strong and, I'm glad she can live without the bubble!
Such a wonderful outcome for Sally. 🙂
She's so excited about everything !! Except perhaps water !
This is my favourite story on Dodo!
Bless ❤️
Thank you! She's too cute.
The fact that you can fall head over heels in love with a Dog almost instantly is so funny to me .
God bless you the angel & the cutie...so happy she is so healthy Now.
WOW ❣️❤️❤️❤️
It's not every day that you find someone with an oxygen bubble in their house.
One of the cutest of all the Dodo videos !
I am sitting in a Panera bawling my eyes out. Thank you so much for investing in this little floof and giving her a chance at life. Every animal deserves to be this loved, valued, cherished, and supported. Sending love, light, and many blessings!
I was overwhelmed when I saw her with that tube attached to her nose. She had such a will to live. How can one not fall for her. ❤❤❤
Sweet little Sally !! What a beautiful little thing !!
Wonderful people, thank you for all you do 🐕🐾💜💜💜
What a pretty girl. She wanted to live, so she fought for it. Go live your best life, sweetie.
OMG, this is a miracle, I must say. I guess your efforts paid well and someone's prayers have been answered. God bless this little cutie. She's a fighter and seeing her gasping for air brought tears in my eyes.
I have severe asthma so I missed out on my entire childhood. My lungs eventually got a little stronger as I got older so I eventually got to live my life. I’m glad Sally got better because living in a bubble is the worst.
Glad she survived i can't wait to get a dog
How incredibly sweet.
What a lovely  story
That breeder should stop breeding if she has health challenged puppies.  Too much inbreeding or breeding to get a look versus good health.  Why do people create a dog that needs to see the vet for all its life??  NOT impressed!
not gonna lie watching her pick out her first toy nearly had me in tears.
When she licked the glass and put her tiny paw on it my heart melted. 😭❤ What a sweet baby. I'm so happy she made it outside of the bubble. Love and dedication can do amazing things ✨️
She is adorbs 🥰🥰😘
It's sad how her breeding made her have health issues. But my God she's so cute with her clumsy self. I laughed so hard when she tipped over from just shaking her ears. 😂😂
Oh my gosh. She is so pretty and sweet and smart.!!! Ahh I love her. Way to go sally.
Omg. Seeing Sally gasping for air just broke my heart! 🥺😭
the fa t the puppy was smart enough to know that she needed the bubble and would go back when she needed it and come out when she didnt
Wow. Such devotion to this beautiful little soul ❤️😊❤️
SHE is so sweet and cute💕
She is so so cute. She breaks my heart! So glad she got better! Thank you for helping her ❤!
Sally's angels: Thank you for saving, loving, & adopting her.
Poor puppy.
I watched your story earlier on tv,. I'm so grateful for your Hoomans that took such special care of you.  You deserve it ‼️. I pray 🙏 you have a long, happy healthy life filled with lots of love 🐾🐾🐕🐾🐾❣️❣️❣️❣️
she is the cutest little dogie I have ever seen and so strong I love herself and 🌹❤️😀🌹🌹🌹🌹😀😀❤️🤩😍
Wow. Seriously wow. Your knowledge and know how is completely amazing! I didn't even know you could do this for dogs. And - I suspect - there are not a lot of people with available oxygen bubbles available for these sorts of circumstances. Let alone building a bigger bubble!! You are truly amazing.
She has the best of both worlds! 🥰
Speechless.🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Wonderful ❤️
She’s a dachshund.  She’s tough.
This one has to be among the top 20 "Best Video's" of all time by this channel.
Wonderful story. Appreciate the work that went into caring for and rehabilitating her.
She is so cute and I wish she was living with the woman that rescued her!
I believe you're headed to the highest places in Heaven because of your amazing care!!!
this grenouville am so glad those   good people helped him live😀🥺🐈😀❤️❤️❤️❤️
WOW WOW!!!! CUTENESS OVERLOAD!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That was such an amazing story of love and care for a sick little puppy and she grew into a happy healthy dog with a great family!

So glad no one gave up on her. She’s a pretty girl❤
What a strong, brave, floppy-eared floof!
Amazing people. The hours of work they put into this puppy, not to mention the cost of the oxygen, is "above and beyond" as they say.  Awesome people (and she's a gosh darn cutie pie!!!)
Sweet Sally
GOD bless you for saving and taking such good care of her.
Amazing will to live her best life, with all of y’all’s help. Blessings to all of you.💯❤️🙏🏾✝️🙏🏾

Dam, Kathryn is something incredible and that puppy too, a little tear in here is unavoidable..

Sally is beautifull little soul ❤
She is so precious what a little angel.
Sally is adorable 🥰 Very cute 😊
💗💗💗💗💗💗🫂🙏so beautiful
She reminds me of me. I spent alot of time as a little kid in an oxygen tent at the hospital. I kept getting pneumonia.  My athsma was horrible. But i fought and got better each time. Here i am 30 something years later. Still have athsma but it only bothers me at times. Otherwise im heathy! Sally is the perfect pup. So happy for her🥰
They are all beautiful and gorgeous dogs.
The other dog is beautiful and gorgeous!🥰🐕‍🦺🥰
Patience and determination of the vet, alongwith the strength, resilience and courage of sally. ❤️ Hats off
Such dedication- amazing.
The other dog is beautiful and gorgeous!🥰🐕🥰
OMG I LOVE THIS!!!!
so cute
What a beautiful gorgeous puppy!🥰🐶🥰
To The all  lazy people, including me get up and  get out of your bubble of illusion that you build it in your mind for being A loser.  And can’t achieve think. Take this dog as an example, she still fighting for the  life and she has successfully done it by getting out of the bubble that she had no choice in it  So let’s get up and fight for our life and let us make our dreams reality.
She’s an adorable little busy body
God bless you all. ❤️
So sweet. You have made my morning.
Omg her little toddle with just a little sass as she gets more comfortable outside. And then she shakes and just falls over. I love her!
<3
Poor baby, thank you to the people who didn't give up on this angel.
God bless you nurses for this enormous job and gratitude for life 🙏🙏🙏🙏
That is so cute what a tearjerker LOL
Fucking breeders just making money out of them
Thank God for beautiful people like you!!!! Great job!!

omg, it's a whole story! I just feel like I watched a very emotional movie.
She’s a beautiful dog what breed is she
🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
lol the cutest dogs are always those who grew up with health issues and were too small at birth. They always end up being that unique cute one
I needed this smile today, Thank you!
God Bless you guys!!!! 🥰
She's a sweet heart bless her many many years of a good life she deserves it🧡🧡🧡
That is beyond outstanding.. Good Luck to you Sally, I 'll be praying for you....
I wish they'd explain how they fed her. Maybe there's an opening to stick a bottle through?
Perseverance does pay off once you put time and effort to do it.
What a great video.
Aww she's adorable. First time we took our dog shopping he tried to pull a toy off the peg by its leg so I bought him his giraffe. Such a strong lil dog she is from bubble to normal
Aww so cute
Such a terrific story. What a cutie she is💖 Thank you for working so hard to save her.
she's so strong it's inspiring ❤❤ i love her she's sooo cuteee
Hey she got strong enough to swim. I know a lot of adults that gasp for breath including me swimming. I swim on my back until my breathing improves. She is wonderful and these ladies did a lot of work each day. Didn't she say at one point they had to take her and the bubble home each night? Hope you got a big o' Mom car.
This is beautiful 💝  I am so grateful to you all 💞
You are best people. Thank you for my mood and for 1 more happy pup in this world
🙏🙏🙏 those who save them 🐾🐾❤
I am a big tough guy, but I want you to know I love you for the love and care you gave her.
grea mornng insiration!
Go Sally! Thanks to all the beautiful humans who were so patient and didn't give up on her
Sally is THE Queen ❤❤❤
Thank you for brightening up my day!
Hello, Sally it's nice to meet you and you are beyond cute and adorable,❤️🐾🌟💐❤️
She survived early puppyhood just to be covered in pink. Poor pupper…
Officer: sir did you know, how fast your driving. Me: I'm sorry, but this puppy needs me. Maybe if you look at the video, instead of a ticket. You turn on those lights and get me to this puppy. Officer: oh my, give me one second. I'm going to need 3 additional units. ASAP on the double.
What adorable and happy little girl ❤❤❤
Aww poor little baby 😢 the rehabilitation on this bB is awesome!
KUDOS TO SALLY. U BUNCH OF ANGELS, GOD BLESS YOU N SALLY.........LOVE U, SALLY
😢I needed tears to be out of me like this is so sad and so beautiful
Amazing story ! Think of all the dogs that are kept in small cages,never allowed out except when they are experimented on, many are born in labs and will be killed in labs from useless experiments. Join PETA speak up against animal abuse . Always buy products that are not tested on animals. Never buy animals from a breeder or pet store, always adopt,always rescue.  No excuse for animal abuse !!
Skip to the part when she’s all bouncy and lively. Always makes me cry watching dogs get sick or injured.
You are a person full of love and patience thank you ❤
look at that sweet little face! 🥺
Pupper
💖💖💖
So amazing what you have done for her!! Wonderful!!❤️
Thats the cuttess pupppy i every seen oh so cute
Sally is a smart fighter. I'm glad that she has an epic comeback ❤❤❤
Why do I continue to watch these! I’m a man! I need to be watching something violent. No one can ever know..
What a feisty little girl....😍😍

Sally living her best life
Total respect and admiration for the tremendous amount of love and energy and expertise and daily devotional rehab for this Baby.Again stop the Breeders.. It takes an enormous amount of work and medical expertise  and time to fully rehab these pups.Fabulous Job!! Well done.The incubators and oxygen bubble's are amazing technology to Save lives.. Congratulations..What's her name Bubbles? She's so smart and absolutely adorable!
Made me smile the whole video.  GOD bless you for your patience 🙏 with this adorable little girl.

Sally is one of the smartest pups I have ever seen! She knew just when to go back into her bubble. Your unconditional devotion to her is why she is in the best place in her life. 💞🥰
John Travolta would be proud :) Sweet little girl.
ANGELS everyonoe :)
Very beautiful story and she is a real beautie😇🥰😍🤩😘❤❤❤👏
Never trust someone who isn’t this kind to animals

You did a GREAT job with Sally! Your dedication, patience and positivity is inspiring! ❤️
This just goes to show that dogs are meant to be companions to humans..she is too cute 😅
Is she a long haired miniature dachshund?
so CUTE
Thats happens when you make dogs smaller and smaller...
Thank you for reminding us that there is still humanity in this world.
She's so cute 🥰
that was a heroic effort to keep that dog alive
amazing story, a miracle of God...
Poor baby couldn't even get cuddles 😢 just wow you litteraly had to wean her off oxygen. Thats wild.
The amount of the love and patience these people have...Almost unbelievable! God bless you all, kind people!
I just love happy endings..................................so precious.
Amazing story! Couldn't stop smiling the entire video❤
You are a fantastic young woman. The love, care and worry you gave this pup fills my heart with happiness.  Thankyou 😊
What a sweety!!
Bu bebeğe yaşama şansı verdiğiniz için TANRI SİZİ DAİMA KORUSUN 🧿❤️🧿❤️🧿❤️🧿❤️🧿❤️🧿❤️
Miracle ❤
She is absolutely precious and adorable ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jesus is coming soon! Everyone please make sure you know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour! Please don't be left behind! Repent and accept Jesus! JESUS LOVES YOU! John 3:16, Revelation 20:15
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Very dedicated!
Thank you for that. She's adorable! Life saved! One of the most deserving in my opinion
Это просто прекрасно и чудесно...
OMG!! 🥹🥹😭😭😭 So sweet!!!!!
You are "Angel's at work"
She probably developed a lot of scar tissue in her lungs. I wonder what her long term prognosis is
🥲🥲🥲
This story is really wonderful. Really wonderful.
*Sally's lesson for all mammals (including humans):*  Don't give up!  Exhaust all opportunities and angles.   Live to see another day! *The lesson from Sally's caretakers/veterinarians:*  If someone's WILLING TO DO THE WORK and fight for their own survival--don't give up on them!
I can see why the bubble was needed the breeder played god with different breeds and nature wanted her dead. It's sad but it's why I'm against mixed breeding the dog is living a good life now but outside in nature it would have been fatal.
💕💕💕💕
Now this is amazing!  I was so sad at first and then i started smiling and couldn't stop, what a great out come.  You go Sally girl!
Whaaaat. She grew up to be a Weiner dog, lol. Didn't see that coming. So pretty.
Love Sally! Your a wonderful person! God bless you and yours!
So stinking cute!! Good job Sally! Such wonderful parents too❤️
❤️❤️❤️
Why am I hearing "Eye of the Tiger" in the background?
❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ty ty ty ty ty ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🐶🐶🐶🐶
She's so cute! You did a great job saving her life
Aww so precious bless her lil heart prayers for her continued strength and growth
So CUTE CUTIE puppy . GOD BLESSING YOU and all the videos you send us  🙏💕💕💕💕💕
That is awe inspiring and beautiful to watch. It gives me a lot of confidence in myself to change, thank you!
I started crying because I am on oxygen but I never got to get off.  She was adorable.
What a sweet girl.
Correction: "...from a breeder that WOULDN'T take care of her any longer." This breeder just threw away this (most likely inbred) dog because it wasn't profitable.
Wow, that’s dedication to keeping this puppy alive and have a great quality of life as she grew. Now she’s healthy and with a great family. ❤️
Breeders that can't take care of their animals aren't breeders, they are predators
I love every creature and person in this video. 💗
This story about this young pup and the determination of the lady to help her, is far far more important in my view than all the news about a long queue for our royal state funeral..this has got my faith in good humans back on track.
How did you feed her??
Lil' Sally is a precious package🐾💟. One of our  Lord's most beautiful  creations by His design. May God Bless all those that did partake in Sally's  health healing & extension  to a great/happy life. AMEN
I'll bet you live in Denver at 9000 elevation
Breeder? Mmmm!! Homo saps who breed creature for money are vile. Breeders do not have a big enough heat. So grateful for you saving her.
I want my house to be a 24/7 doxie party too😊
SHE IS SO CUTE what kind of dog is she
Would have loved an explanation why she was dependent on higher oxygen concentrations or how exactly they diagnosed that. It's a bit unclear.
She is such a pretty color.
you could have made arm holes closeable with pull strings in the first bubble to be able to pet her inside, similar to a glove box.
Adorable puppy. 🥰
Lotta extra work for just one puppy... and so very worth it! Congratulations to you all for making it possible for this sweet girl to have a great life!
Omg thank you for not giving up on this treasure. ❤🥰
No ur crying
Beautiful story!  Thank you for having the love to save her. She wanted to live and never got depressed about her situation & teaching herself how to get back to the oxygen when she was depleted was brilliant. Bright Blessings for Everyone who can show the incredible value of giving love to life without thought of reciprocity. Sweet, amazing humans!
Precious ❤️
What a wonderful story ❤
Sweet baby! Love little Sally!
🥹💕 so precious
THAT FACE OMG 🥺😭🥺😭
This was a beautiful story I want to thank you people who helped this dog through its difficult journey to see this dog be so happy in the end is what I honestly think life is all about humans helping the less fortunate.
Yes Sally, get that toilet paper!! 😂
I love this success story ❤️ darling🐾🌷
So much love. Beautiful to see the kind hearts everyone has
Her little tail wagging is so precious!
Wow!! What a journey! She is adorable and so blessed Roy have had so much loving care.
💛🍀🐕💪💪💪💪
She is adorable, thanks for saving her!! Mom did a great job!
You guys are Angels ❤️
Sally ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She is so adorable
Wow, what an incredible story. Way to go everyone.
I never count out animals. I found a cat on death door and the VET said she probably will not make it. I said I am not about ready to give up on her and I am paying for you not to either. I have had her for over 17 years. Most loving cat ever.
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Thank God for all the wonderful people who cared for this struggling little life.  No doubt her initial care saved this baby's life and put her on the path of wellness. God bless and keep you all.
Beautiful! 😍
I honestly couldn't fight so hard for an animal then not adopt it. It would break my heart.
Miracle dog!
this is a wonderful story,  what a wonderful metaphor for life as well.
God bless you.
Thank you for saving a beautiful life and never give up on her.
Great story!
What a wonderful story, it made me cry! 😍
Beautiful !
Lovely story but I wish more people would fight for the lives of Human Babies they are more valuable. 👍👍🥰🥰
I'm so glad these amazing people never gave up on her and let her do things on her own time! Now she can have the best life ever!
Once again, The Dodo has me choking up! What a sweet, funny baby girl!  Now, I'm compelled to head upstairs and love on my sweet Bailey!
What a wonderful story❤❤❤❤❤. Thank you all  for talking good care of her && for loving her❤️
I wouldn't have been able to let her go.  I would have been a foster fail.
Thank you for find and help puppy.God bless you♥️🙏🏻
A lot of beautiful people,tanks for the dog😊
Ty was very inspirational made Me tear up to see such Care from 2 Families for 1 incredible Puppy/Dog !!
Beautiful story xx
Awesomeness
She’s so sweet that she knew to go back in when she needed to! What an intelligent and amazing baby. Happy she’s better!
It would be so interesting if they were to x-ray her lungs and look at them, to see just how much they've helped her lungs grow to where they needed to be!!  What a lovely baby, and she's so lucky to have had these humans around her along the way!
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. I DON'T HAVE THE WORDS, THANK YOU!
That adorable little girl really wanted to live.  She was not giving up and thank.  For a puppy in a bubble she got a lot of attention and love.  This is a really beautiful story and the woman who took such amazing care of this little pup has a heart of gold.  This is definitely a little miracle dog.
Oh she’s so tiny❤ what a brave baby

Thank you.
I'm happy Sally survived. These animal videos takes my mind off politics and thinking about all the problems we have in our nation, and brings peace into my mind and joy into my heart. When you're down and out these videos will cheer you up and put a smile back on your face. Thank you! 👍
This gives me another reason to strongly dislike breeders. Thank you soooo very much. Doxies are the best!   I adopted a Doxie from a breeder who dumped her at a rescue.
Omg this baby!!!!!!!!
The difference between animals & ppl is even while walking back to her much needed oxygen, her little tail never stopped wagging!
Why they are so cute? 😍
This is why backyard breeders should be monitored and should be made to hold licences so people breed for the dogs best interests not for purely just the money . With so many dogs that end up in rescues  , pounds  or being dumped  there is way too many dogs who are suffering because of no fault of their own . I would like to see that people who own dogs should also hold licences and have to do a basic test and house inspections to see if they are suitable to own a dog . It may seem far fetch in some people's eyes but in doing these things there would be a dramatic reduction of dogs ending up in rescues and pounds or being dumped .
Possibly the cutest little puppy I've ever seen
Oh my gosh!! So much work to help her live. God bless people like you!!
Very few people would put this time, effort and care for a little puppy. God bless you.
What a cutie
*What a Sweetheart!*

ADORABLE!!!!
This is so sweet. She is so courageous.
I watched her until they put her outside i think they should let her go outside since she was little cuz outside you have more oxygen then inside.
Such a lovely 😍 story of overcoming barriers to life.  Way to go Sally and may you have the best life ever as you missed out on so much struggling to breathe in your little bube.
This is lovely moving story. Well done to all involved.
look at the smart baby 😭 she’s too precious 💙
Now, this is a story!
That’s a cute dog right there. I’m glad she was so loved and cared for!
Such a great story and such dedication from staff to save this dog
God did not create us to rule nature  God create us to be sheperts of the nature  Our inteligense has this purpose and not other...
What a great story of healing and such a sweet little dog.
God bless her🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌💔💔💔
I'm a 45-year-old white man living in a sanctuary City. I don't have a college degree and I have never been able to hold a job for very long. Not to mention the gang stalking trash who follows me telling lies.  I have major depression and collect Social Security check for it.  it comes with Medicare and public housing.  I am on a plateau, so it's not me changing the things that I do because I am a legal responsible adult. I think it comes by you realizing that I'm doing the best I can and it doesn't get much better than this. And that there isn't anything wrong with me the way I am
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👍❤️🍀👪👍🐕
💖💖💖💖💖
Such an adorable creature
Thank you so much for all the love and care you provided her so she could live! She is beyond adorable! What a little Angel!  ❤😇❤ hope she lives a long long live. Beautiful little fighter.  I love watching these videos. They brighten my day!
Y'all gave that baby a chance at life and look what she gives. You get to have her as a companion and we get to see how great she is.  A win for everybody! Bless you all for saving her.
Thanks very much 💞🐕‍🦺
I'm not crying I'm cutting onions!
AW
If she isn’t just the cutest little thing 🥺🥺😭
Thank you for fighting for her.  I couldn’t do this job, because you’ll inevitably lose a patient.  It would break my soul to lose a sweet puppy.
Damn what a fighter, you go girl!
😍
What a little cute nugget.  So glad she survived. Thanks to all who saved this precious baby. 💜🐶
Oh………..
Sally is in the perfect home!  I'm thrilled that this sweet, gorgeous girl found such a loving family.  Thank you for saving and never giving up on Sally and all these special babies.  Peace and blessings.
Great story! So glad someone gave her a chance!
Precious little girl 🥰❤
Y’all are angels.
Just gotta love people that go the extra mile to help a pup like this.
A huge thank you to everyone for not giving up on her.
This is a beautiful example of what loving kindness can do. 💜
Please be sure to lift her up and pull her down off high places like couches and beds so she doesn't have the repetitive trauma of falling back down etc.  Which can rupture an intervertebral disc and cause paralysis in dachshunds.
Wow
Jeez, what a poor puppy 💔
The Dodo: "How can we make people cry today?" The Dodo:"Puppy in a bubble." Great vid.
At the beginning of the video: *stuck in an oxygen chamber* At the end of the video: *declaring nuclear war against toilet paper*
Aww God bless the sweet puppy and God bless you for helping her
She must be the cutest puppy I've ever seen 😍
I was crying the whole time.. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
God Bless your family.😇
This was the most amazing healing story I ever viewed. God bless her rescuers for all the hard work and tough days in her healing!
This is beautiful 😍
She's so precious. Look at that adorable face. I want to give her loads of cuddles and kisses.
One of the best stories on Dodo 🥰
Omg. I literally never have seen a cuter dog, and I have a dog that's cute! She looks too adorable to be real!
I would have named her Bubbles. She is so beautiful. 😍
Hopefully you also had her on antibotics.
That little face
I love this little sweetie 💜💜💜
Awe.. poor girl.  I'm so glad you all cared for her the way you did!  May the universe bless you.
Amazing story
Congratulations Sally and to those loving furparents for not giving up on her! ♡♡♡
Oh my Gosh, She is a Brave, Beautiful Pup, Stunning 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

What’s that yellow thing on her head ? Feeding tube ? 😢
I had a huge smile on my face through this entire video. She is lovely. Such a huge personality. So much hard work well worth every second.
She’s stinking adorable !!!!!!!
Glad to see this little soul survive and thrive! Well earned. More sweetness is never a bad thing in this bitter world.
OMG That leap into the chamber. 4:37
You are very unique to do all of this 😂😂😇😇❤️❤️.

Thank you for taking care of the little bubble dachshund.  She has such a wonderful  life now with other dachshunds and a wonderful  family.  My dachshund  took care of me with my asthma  problem as a kid.  She would  know if I needed help and go get my mom.  She stayed close  to me when I couldn't play with the other kids.   I loved that dog.  Those dogs are so sweet and smart.  Thanks for taking care of the bubble puppy.  Thanks for the video!!!!!
THANKS for your Enormous Heart and taking the time to give this little warrior the chance to live a normal life.
God bless All living creatures have spirits and ate of Divine Creation.
They are amazing people for helping her I’m sure that was very difficult to do. I am happy she got a great home but jealous because I want her so bad
ooohhhhh my godddddddd shes so tiny!
God bless the rescuers for saving Sally’s life!!! 🙏🏽❤️🙌🏽
This woman's dedication is truly remarkable.  The constant monitoring and many sleepless nights, I'm sure.  So happy this worked out for the puppy and her new family.
Adorable!  🐶👍😍
She is absolutely adorable .....the cutest precious little furrbieee I've seen .God bless u 😍😍😘😘☺️👍

Wow, that's an amazing story.
What a little fighter!  😍  so adorable and smart. I love her and hope
Thank you for putting the hours into saving that precious life!! God bless you and your furr babies!
What a cutie patootie!🥰 Edit: And now she is bubble free!☺️🤣
Reminds me of a little kitten on oxygen I came across at the vet when taking my cat for a check-up. Long story short, the kitten pulled through and became a big fluffy cat and the vet office’s mascot!
Oh God look at that face 😍
Omg she’s a ween! I wasn’t sure when she was little but thought she looked like one. What a sweet baby! I would’ve adopted her.
MY GOODNESS HOW AWESOME IS THIS STORY & how amazing are these 2 vet tech's !?!?!?!? Many but MANY blessings to this little girl Sally & EVERYONE who gave her a chance on living her best life! The time & patience,  care it took for Sally to slowly get stronger from literally knocking on the door of death is truly remarkable... i know one thing, the vet clinic in the state that their in has to be one of THE BEST around , almost positive it HAS to be.  . Amazing story, hands down.
When she's a baby, her hind legs move like a toy dog that I used to have when I was little. Ahh, nostalgia. Thank you for that.
Sally has come a long way Thanks to Kathryn and Bonnie who never gave up on her Little Sally has felt loved and pampered and she decided that life was worth living to the fullest She really is a cuttie
You women are so amazing - all the time and care you took and then this woman, Bonnie, who has kids, dogs, a job takes on another dog.  Are you people real?  If there's a Heaven, that will be your next stop.  Bless you all for your service and love to animals.
She’s so cute what kind of dog is she?
Totally amazing!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Aww I love her
The thumbnail looked like the dog had a fishing hook in their nostrils, making me worried until I realised its just plastic wrapping paper with the high-light, shaped like a hook.
Omg soooo cute god bless you all stay safe
God bless all you who do this work.❤️

Cute!!Cute!!😍😍😍
Warmed my heart! So happy Sally is okay and enjoying life! 🤍
There is no greater service to God than giving life to someone.❤️❤️❤️
'He's a bubble boy jerry!'
Just sobbing into my coffee ❤
Man y'all know to make a grown man tear up. She is absolutely adorable and y'all are some amazing human beings..love to all of you!
What a beautiful little dog. The work and patience to save her life are awesome. Well done. 😍🐕👌👍
The chick who adopted the dog should also invest in a treadmill and more protein.... Did ya'll see those calves?
Ever dog and animal's deserve to live these great people  who save them they deserve the praise and respect they should be getting a Platinum medal 😃😃😃
Amazing story.
So glad you helped her!! It’s amazing how she got better, and seemed so scary at times. What a sweet girl she is!!
That puppy's face is the cutest thing I've EVER SEEN!!!! im so happy she's okay now!!  (Edit: thanks for all the likes! I appreciate it!)
Look at that darling angel there licking the glass, I'm so glad that Sally had enough spunk and fight in her to survive. We may be little but we are in it to be strong and grow... Happy life Sally you deserve it...
What a cute and tiny puppy 🐶! What a fantastic family, who do all that for the dog 🥰❤💯! She is growing up and so sweet and funny. What a heartwarming story 😊.
❤❤❤🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺❤❤😊😊🍀🍀🌞🌞
I never seen anything like that before. That's amazing what they did for that precious little thing
Sally is a warrior, she over came her disability and won. She's an inspiration. ♥️ 🐾🐾
Glad you nurtured and cared for Sally. You gifted her a chance at a beautiful life even when the odds were stacked against her.💙
God bless all those people, you are true heroes!
Baby
This is nothing less than a miracle. From a sickly little puppy that has to stay in an oxygen chamber to a puppy that can play with children and try to destroy a roll of toilet paper....that's a miracle.
I don't know how the first 5 minutes took ages to end to see Sally finally having her health back. It made my whole 2022.
She's absolutely beautiful ❤️🤩
♥♥♥
it’s like she had long covid…..
👍👍👍
That's so great that you were available to nurse her until her lungs were clear or fully developed. Many times these facilities aren't available with that kind of equipment and they don't make it. 😁😁👋👋💖💖🐕🐕
Sally was like that's not water that's lava!! Lol
I'm not crying, you......no. im def crying!   You ladies are amazing and sally is a miracle pup!
She deserves only the best things!
💖💖💖
She is so precious! What an amazing story of human love and the dog knowing itself! She said, 'I'm done with the bubble! Let me see the world!'
Adorable! She is such a survivor and knew when it was time to grace the world w/ her presence full-on. She truly has a village to love on her. Beautiful story!
Thank you to the rescuers who dedicate so much time, effort and LOVE to helping these babies. You are the heroes of this story! Sally is the inspiration- to never give up ❤ life is worth fighting for ❤
Thank you to everyone who helps any animal
Adopt don’t shop 💔
Little Sally is Determined to LIVE  🎉 ❤😊

What a special girl!!  Thank you for giving her the chance to live a beautiful life!! ❤
Amazing dog and Amazing people

I have been having such bad depression the past few months and watching this video has lifted my spirits tremendously, thank you, Sally girl!!  You’re a fighter!! So glad you’re thriving and living the best, healthy and most happy life-you deserve it! 💝 🐾
Just want to once again say that breeders are the worst excuses for humans on planet Earth.
Increíble 👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🤗🤗🤗
This is a beautiful Story
It's awesome to see what not giving up does, she kept going and didn't have to be in the bubble no more. Never stop keep going.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
What a beautiful little thing! Great job to everyone that helped her along her way. You're all absolute heroes the lot of you!
Love this beautiful story ❤
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
So fcuking beautiful - thank you for your hard work, all of you!

For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.  Matthew 5:2-12 King James Version 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.  Matthew 24:4-14  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. 24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. 24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.   Exodus 20 King James Version 20 And God spake all these words, saying,  2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.  4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.  5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;  6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.  7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:  10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:  11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.  12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.  13 Thou shalt not kill.  14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.  15 Thou shalt not steal.  16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.  17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.    ..,..,..,.., .......... .,........,. ,..,,,,,,,,.., ,,.........,, ....,.....
