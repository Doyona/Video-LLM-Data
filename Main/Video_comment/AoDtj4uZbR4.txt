Bass truly bring the world together
Shit sounds like Parrappa the rapper song😭
Snoop Dogg referencing rbl posse "bammer weed" in a davie video is next level internet.
Hey, Davie you need video with Atkinson ))
Aeeeeew eu lembro disso! Que bom ver que essa época saga chegou a um final feliz! 😎👍🏻
❤️😂
Thats art
The ,,omg” hit hard🔥
Ahh!! How the hell!!… oh ok you paid him ok that makes sense👍 still pretty sick dude!! 🤘 a song with Snoop?! 👏 🫡
OMG
We all gotta admit that its not worth thousands to even talk with snoop dogg, you gotta pay millions 😂
Bass
Snoop high as always 💀
Is this after snoops strokes?
l
Davie is best on earth
He prob got high and forgot 😂
Davie, Davie: Davie 504, ft. Snoop dogg
Davey put in years of effort, but Snoop heard the beat, said whatever the weed was telling him to in the moment, and left it at that
Since he charges 250k for 16 bars, I really don't want to do the math to know how much he paid for that crap. 😂😂
OMG
crackalackin
I think Snoop made that on his phone from the toilet.
Is this real
:)
GO Davie!❤
Hahahaha his lyrics cheap AF
Yo or amazing
wtf😂
Snoop Dogg DM you what a milestone
Bro that OMG really got me man 😂😂😂
EPIC
is this ai?
1000 dollars ?  Really
Woohioo
Snoop Dogg is so weak
I think Davie should ask for a refund.
Life is not easy, born poor die poor 😭
Davie stole this baseline from Afroman!
Non troppo entusiasmo
davie  is the best
Bad ass
Waste of money.
Snoop shoulda done better:   Davie, a.k.a. slap shady, cause he's pale and slim like him, maybe I should get some gravy on my mom's spaghetti,  cause Davie's palms are sweaty from slapping that bass, Zoom in on that face!
who's old and from The Bay and recognizes the "Don't give me no bammer weed" quote?
Reminds me of a collab he did with Aleman, called Mi tio snoop
скажи по-русски хоть один раз клёво 👍
I can see why snoop doggy got to the top
The disclaimer at the end… I knew it was coming, but made me fart laugh 😅
Bro did not get his money’s worth, those were some shitty ass bars 💀
😂😂😂😂😂
Serious question. Are you autist?
dont give me no bammer...
OMG
when no one in comment section saw it was AI video
Weakass bars but, we'll allow it
Rappers shouldn't ever hang out with or collab with musicians.
Snoop said the forbiden G-word!
You're now becoming popular dude
He gave you some 80's devolved weak rap. Whats this guy famous for?
I love snoop...he is very welcoming
Snoop dog is the fakest gangster to live. Huge sellout who would run from a fight as told by 2pac when questioned by eminem on album.
Dammm davie..i know you since always say words.."Stay Groove"...😂😂😂
shoutout to RBL
Great Snoop, Great Slap, Great Vibe😂 It's a magic, when you wish become real!
Most probably he was too high at that time when he saw your text😂
love your videos man!🤘🏻💯
Somehow Davie shows less emotion than kahwaii Leonard
😂
He gets a collab with Snoop and still keeps this „yeah i fucked up real Bad,but who cares“ look
You was robbed
Hahahahah I really wasn't expecting that! 😂
Is this guy a descendant of Dracula?
Crackilackin! Hilarious snoop!!! 😂
Very cool groove! Whats a crackin a lackilin😂
Unsubscribed.  Dont like that dog.
Davie420
NICE 😂❤
**Fart**
this goes in top 5 videos i ever watched on youtube <^<3
Bootsie Collins
There is only one Davey.
Omg... 😶 bro has no emotions
USA rap is really the poverty of lyrics
Very nice of snoop to give Davie $1000 for a feature
I never imagined someone could mix bass and humour. Slap!
This was beautiful. Im crying. Thank you Davie Davie ❤❤❤😮😮😮😢
Haha Thxs brother for the energy
OH EM GEE 😂
“OMG 😐”
Horrible freestyle rapper. He can't.
my drea, is to fly with messi,we go with elon musk and he gives me 1 billion dollars
CAMEO
Bro Snoop is soo lucky
Omg
Snoop Dogg should be canceled for doing Hogan face.
That was fire🔥🔥🔥
Snoop was cooking for a few weeks 🔥
Call me cynical but I think Snoop might be stoned.
😂😂😂
Hard work😂
Im watching you from the memes copilation
100 percent just came up with that on the spot 😂
Never give up your dreams. Hard work and determination,  you will collaborate with Davie504.
Snoppieeee
You gotta figure hes a busy person
Siiick
The ending is not what I think😂
Если бы Усович был басистом в штатах.
Lol he cut the cameo watermark😂
Snoop doing his community service. 😂😂😂 Jk. That’s fucking awesome! Congrats on that for real man.
Why you look like when you play a horror game you won’t get scared
Guitar... far... amazing rhymes
😂love it
This guy's so funny 😂😂😂
Bro do the full song
For whom the bell tolls pleaseee
Oh my god 😐
He charges 2m for 6 bars, did snoop pay u?
That O.M.G killed me😅
"Omg 🗿"
Goan G!
Great IA edition
Always sad to see someone talented humouring and idolising someone not so talented
Fucking hate how he talk 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮nd showing attitude
Come? lo hai pagato??? Ma dai
Аххахвхвхв
Very good
Man Snoop is DESPERATE god damn
Why ??
You're a legend!
LMAO
M8
Don't give me no Bammer Weed!!!
One of the most futile rappers, and all rappers are futile.
Great!
What is "bammer weed". im trying to stay away from it
the few weeks of him not answering was him just weeding his garden if you catch my drift
You should not have paid for that...  He just pissed on your bass track
Sussy baka☠️
Dam
Grande davie
Wrong tempo for snoop my man.
So. Cameo.
It's great people responding hahaha
Isn’t he Snoop Lion now?
2 of my fav ppl in 1 video
Blend W..
Blud high as a kite
omg he is so emotional we can see him hiding us tears
Cap 🧢
Did you see your collab with awesomeboysjptv?
This collab is E P I C O
i thought he said "i always wanted to make a son with snoop dogg"
The last sentence made me give up on my dream(which I don't have)
Cruising and driving the Donk awesome  lol
Next make a video of you and him taking a few bong rips. 💨
Sì mo te manda la fee di 250 k ahahaha
Bro has no emotions
At least Snoop called Davie his baby
Dude hell yeah
I just love, how chill is Snoop.
Well, having thousands of dollars to pay Snoop Dogg is almost as cool as doing a collab with him.
Davie davie wassup baby 😂 im driving you crazy 😂😂 gay ngsta shit 😂😂😂😂
I always wanted to make a song with Snoop Dog. *Keeps a straight face the whole time*   Me: 🤔
Bro wrote a rap on chatgdp
Snoop dogs lyrics are like that of a kid in high school.
You should have said "I showed you my bassline pls response"
Este ql es mí idolo y wea
Waiting a collab with Eminem
It sounds like he’s saying baby davie 😂
If all of bros dreams came true he would probably just say omg
Never let em know your next move..
a kid would have come up with better rhymes than that...
If you want snoop to collab with you too, you can send some set dollar amount and he will provide what you ask for. I don’t know where you go for more information on doing that, but I’m guessing it isn’t too hard to find out with a few web searches.
Is he saying mate? Like a British person?
did someone hear that snoop Dogg said bass GUITAR. DAVIE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY
2 people with no emotions whatsoever
Whats crackalackin’? The earth
❤
Damn Snoop really paid for a Davie Cameo
Davie:OMG Also Davie:😐
Daveeeey, how you doin'
now get eminem
“What’s crack a lackin “ 💀💀💀
Wooooooow
Jesus was here
when does this drop?
Snooped dog
That's awesome!
yup, dont forget marijuana
That will be 250k
Davie Davie. I am fanatical about my love of bass guitarists even though I can’t play a lick. I can’t explain it. It began back when me and my brothers watched the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. I found myself keying on the bass, and learned my first lesson on music. I figured out it was the guy on the far left with his guitar the opposite way than the other two. I then figured out that bass guitar players play left handed. I just loved the sound, and to this day I still always key in on the bass in any song. You are becoming one of my favorite, and I listen to them all. Or, most of them. The truly greats. Thank the stars for these shorts. They are showing so many bass players now. I am not sure if we entering a golden age because the gods off bass gave us original bass lines that are being covered   by budding bassists because if you can play one of them in time you are going to be in a band! I love your skill, you Badass Bassist. But, your videos are getting to be as good as your playing.
Bro seems so happy
Arjun Kapoor got a hard competition
Davie’s face every video🗿
waaaaauuuuu
Snoop dogg is this real?
He called it a guitar...
😮
Snoop Dog is the most chill celebrity ever.
My dream is meet with you

Epic !!
A girl in my class has a dad that’s a dj. They have met SnoopDog before and her dad even came to class. So iv met someone that met snoopdog

Needs to be FAT! And more simplified. Don't do "too much". 👍
"hard work"
I like he said omg😂😂
Snoop dogg is the cringyest poser I've seen yet.   I mean , what is this " Davie, babe" shit Lord hahaha
Nahhh that is AI generated
-Italians are on of the most passionate people. Italian:
GG Davie
Um did anyone else notice that that’s not snoop dog
At least he called it bass guitar instead of guitar with missing strings or 4 stringed guitar
so inspirational
Bro I saw your 1st video, and now your'e great dood
👌
Snoop: that will be $250k
Bro even when he is excited : 🗿😐
Many weeds pass 😂😂
I thought you said "I've always wanted to make a son with Snoop Dogg" and I was thinking "who doesn't"
What's a collab
☠️💀☠️

You don't need the dog, you do very well by yourself!
Snoop Dogg is the coolest guy I know
Davie Davie ☺️

Ive Ben a Fan When U were 4M and Now Ur 12M what an adventure
Ho-ly-shit
❤
Now minions talk... To Snoop Dogg sitting in the White House chair. Don't forget his video with Lil dicky
Moral of the story: all your dreams can come true -      If you have money
Yeah well i have one hundred million power because i chose the vikings which have an increased carrying capacity for materials which allowed me to build quickly and efficiently to make my city as strong as possible. After that, making soldiers is easy and quick and i can easily defeat anyone in my way!
Snoop is soooo overrated
Davie definitely paid Snoop Dog for this because he charges BIG for cameos
😂nicely done man✌️
Meega❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I got motivated and liked the video and then at the end I was like hmm... Disliked. Lol 🤣
Why is snoop dog black?!!
I appreciate davie for supporting small rappers like this snoop dogg guy, hopefully he becomes famous

We don't smoke that S*** in the S.O.C. 😍😍😍
Davie overlooking the fact that Snoop said "Bass Guitar".
letss goo
Davie504 so humble making a collab with Snoop Dogg
He's just taking a crap and checking his messages.
Lyrics are the best!!  “Davie Davie, Don’t give me know bammer weed” OMG
I can see all that hard work in the bags under your eyes bro. Or wait....is it the dope?
The end 💀
are u sponsorised by Xanax 0.5mg
Are u really like this
"OMG"💀💀
Snoop has 0 bars. Anyone could have written that
holy shit
I hope the payment part was a joke, because what Snoop did there was something he should pay Davie for xD
Brooo we need the instrumental
he's the only guy can say i'm pay to win, and no one gonna believe it
What’s crackalin’ had me crackin’
Have anyone ever seen this man with emotions?
Davie's made it. By god, he made it!
davie davie wassup baby
How dope is that
Catchy enough tune, but the lyrics seem a little... elementary 🤔
😊
Very impressive, but can you slap Elon Musk while he's asleep at the factory? 🦾
He sounded like Chilled out version of Harstem.
Too fast for snoop style.
Cameo lol
Davie you real like Girno Govana
Damn
Many weeks passed but then i        Give "thousands of dollars"
Anda adalah pemain bass yang sangat jago yang aku kenal 🤩
Snoop is the most wholesome dude on earth.
Metaforando gringo

I don't mean to be rude but he sounds like a vampiric robot
While watching this video I recently remembered about my homework which I have to pass in like 30 minutes..200 words essay..thank you Davie but no thank you
OMG hes so lucky that  Davie504 wants to collab with him❤   Hee boots up the career of this snoop dog guy So lit
HAAAAAHHHlove you Davie504 3<
“omg🗿”
🤣😆
you look like young Amitabh Bachhan
The reason behind every success is hard work, NO! paying 1000s of $$$
Can’t believe he got that 250k out of you man, and a video for another 250k…. 500k!!!
It is said that Snoop Dogg knows who actually killed 2Pac, but keeps silence.
Just tried a bass bro the feeling tho 🥶
Ciao dall'Italia
Respect Davie 👍
SNOOPP DOOGG?
Wow
listen to how basic snoop is though... like people really think he's top 10? like fr tho? I never think he says anything above something a 6th grader could come up with.
How Much ??
Snoop appears with smoke
Davie you look very stoned
Wow…What a crappy return from Snoop. He can’t come up with a good rhyme? Thought he was a genius writer? Menghh.
I just paid snoop dog thousand of dollars. Lol 😂
Every time snoop introduces himself it sounds like you called a gta character 😂
Fr bro
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Hard
As someone called Davy this was pretty cool.
I think snoop really liked Davie's name
🗿👍
Ez best collab
i heard that as "I've always wanted to make a son" 💀
Man just got a 250k collab for free
🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's funny how you have more subscribers than him😂
Good job man
it’s sounds good
Why did you pay him tho?
🤨🕶️🤏🏼
Yippee
Davie paid him..
🔥🔥
Davie out here giving small artists a chance to Collab with him and gain some more viewers what a nice guy
I'm surprised dr.Dre didn't start playing when snoop starting talking.
Bruh I'm him bruh
So kids,always remember money solves everything😂
Your the reason I want a bass
.
That happened to me once
Will you ever laugh in your video
Props to snoop for going two bars without saying he smokes weed or telling us his name

Never give up on your dreams.  More like NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN NEVER GONNA RUN AROUND AND DESERT YOU

Snoop Dogg sang that like on weed
Understood, but why it feels like you always have a blink moment live and you're about to die... 👀

Brings a tear to my eye.
Don't give me no bammer weed

Cool
Never wake up in your dream
the numbest face ever seen:
The end really says a lot about society
When your wish comes true but it is expensive
'Davie Davie wassup baby' The best line
"I just paid Snoop Dogg thousands of dollars to do this"  Hey it was definitely worth it at least.
I love how he has a deadpan expression on his face the whole time he was talking
😀🍕
W
you are wasting his money, you are taking his money
Omg
Omg
Fire🔥 tho

Davie baby
This is the biggest crossover since endgame
hahaha
Is this real xd
Went dark at the end
Yes
Son Tung MTP (a singer, song writer/creator in Viet Nam) paids Snoop a heafty amount of 1B (estimated 932.879.000 VND) (aka 40.000 USD) for Snoop to show up 20 second in his MV.
He's the type of person to say "Congratulations on winning" and then go "it was just luck"
Ayo 😳
All video: No emotion, and so no emotion
But he is dead
Moral of the story: Only Money matters
Your awesome Davie
The end was just....         ...so disappointing.
Can we appreciate the effort he puts into his videos?
Hi do you remember me?
Wow...How many emotions on his face😱
WTF the ending 😂😂😂
Bit awkward the way he’s just sitting there staring at us but ok…
amazing!!!
Big smoke weeds everyday
:)
🥴😂💖💯😁
He looks like di maria
My dad actually works with snoop
Snoop dog double g
The hardest song of the century 🔥🔥

hilarious 😂
Snoop dog is lucky to have Collab with David
Wait, what the 🤣
Prob the only and last yt that is honest
Only OG's know this
Am I the only one that's addicted to this song?😂
The fact he was smoking weed when he gave his response really shows snoop dogs character
Snoop was so high lol
Why does he always look depressed,tired, and sad?
Pay
Well, in fact, that's still some kind of collab.
I don't know why but you sound a little diferent

Good job😁👍
o m g
Snoop Dogg congrats him but he said Omg with no facial expressions 😂😂😂😂😂 Edit: But when he said "I gave him 1000 of dollars to do it" GOT ME 😂😂
He made it with app called CAMEO
Snoop said cracker lacking
They way he said "Omg" just made me wheeze
Why would Snoop dog even bother about your stupid existence. You have no skills and that bass sounds trash.
.Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent you shall be saved give it a try I mean accepting Jesus is a great thing cause if you do your safe from hell you might think hell isn't real but it is and heaven isn't boring ppl think heaven is boring but in fact, you can fly in heaven accept Jesus as your Lord and savior repent and always remember God does Love you
"OHH am gee" great reaction 👌
God damn dude. Take some vitamins…
That was so good😎

Ate you the son of dracula???

I love how he is so emotionless
Atleast he is honest
Omg
Just want to say thank you for always bringing great content! I love these! ❤️

The Dimitri vibes is strong in this one
Moral: He's never gonna give it up and never gonna let us down
OMG
It's not an mistake ✨ITS AN MASTERPIECE✨
Man, Snoop had zero enthusiasm for this lol. He sounds like he can barely be bothered to finish. I'd expect more if I was paying him thousands
His ooOhmG is hilarious to me every time
Dave Dave murder was the case they gave me
Oh wow. I was like snoop is so kind hearted.. a side of him we never knew. Lol not that he shouldn’t be paid but damn nothing ain’t abt money these days.. geez

“Never give up on your dreams” Me= stop lying! MY DREAMS ARE IMPOSSIBLE!! Everyone checking my brain/dreams Also everyone= true, and such idiotic dreams
But Levi said that "Give up on your dream and die"
People really think Snoop Dogg can rap🤣🤣🤣🤣What a joke of a lucky man .Stoned snd untalented 🤡🤡🤡
Hid deadpan is on another level. A deadpan base character just feels right.
Dude looks like Dracula from hotel Transylvania
Awesomeness. 😁
shroud didnt get anysleep
Why dont u smile
“Omgie”
Hmmm slap bass or beat drums the market is wide open. For a small fee I'll show you the door.
Davie is such a jackass. But thats why i love him.
Worth it
I hope he paid 9999$.
HEY 🥰 SOOO SIK VIDEO MAN!! SPEAK ENGLISH PLEASE 😂
Snoop and DMX are maybe the Greatest people from the rap industry of my time!
Amen
Lamo
I love how he says OMG
MATCHIEF
Stop lying to us
Haha snoops video message ends him : oh mah gud(god)
Why do your eyes look like your soul is dead
Snoop: when the bigs(big guys) try to get at you park(hide) it like its hot  When the hoes(girls) try to get at you pop(punch) it like its hot  He only fights people weaker than him. Weak person
Well that is true tho hard work and trying your best works I think…
OOF
He is dead
You say don't give up on your dream my dream: to become a unicorn
*turns into Samsung Ringtone*

That was tight though he can play that bass
😏👍
See? You can buy Happiness! "You can't Buy Happiness" is a bad phrase
Best collab‼️‼️‼️
That song was fire AF
aaw Cool
Moral of the story, pay everything with money to get what you want
It’s not a mistake it’s a masterpiece
It’s not a mistake it’s a masterpiece
We don't smoke that shit in the sfb
I just want to give him some 💰 for making great content.
Thanks I'll never give up to support 😁😉
It's not a mistake✨It's a master piece.
Let's be honest, Snoop paid thousands for that fine bassline. First song on his new album: davie flavor baby.
Too easy
Morale of the Video: Pay people to get what you want
It's catchy-
I’m gonna tell my kids this is what the food inspector from ratatouille used to do

And that's how the music business marketing works kids!
Snoop gasoline

You are awesome, Davie.
Snoop!!!!!
Aye
The ‘omg’ just got me 😂😂
Him: Hard work and never giving up  Actually not I just paid Snoop dog thousands of dollars to do this Me: well it was a lot of hard work to get that money 🤑💰
Better to put thousands on a snoop collab rather than an NFT.

I just paid him thousands of dollars. The story of snoops career. Dude has featured on a trillion songs...
Too easy
Bro just said David David oh baby😭
Ayoo 😳
It's catchy
It's funny but the funniest thing is that you paid thousands for him to give you sh!t because he was terrible.
He looks like that dracula guy from the new cgi movie loll
Snoop is the goat
Guys has the greatest ringtone ever.
Day 2 wit no lean
Can we just appreciate that these shorts save our boredom everyday💅
It’s not a mistake ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
How was Spock able to get into touch with Snoop like that?
Its not a mistake✨ its a master piece✨
Imagine snoop dogg comment🤔

Snoop Dogg is so nice
"it's not a mistake",✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
I'm addicted to this video 😭😭
wait Davie is thebestcube HD?
"DON'T GIMME NO BAMMER WEED"😂😂😂😂😂😂 I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT IN SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏💜💙💚🧡💛🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤
He look so depressed
"everyone is a piece of shit including me"
Snoop dog always looks like he is on crack
Omg your fingers are off on the ktar
Davie Davie wassup baby
This was funny and amusing, mission accomplished 😂😂😂
Davie is a true man of Dogg Culture
Good old Snoop eh , fair play to him
🍃🍃🍃
I was thinking it cost millions
Real advice
Love that snoop recorded this in his private jet
The lyrics kinda Sus
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love the transparency 😂
The honesty at the end 😂
This guy is so fucking annoying
Snoop puppy
Newsflash snoop ain't calling you mate. He said mane😂
The end 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well im glad for you. But how much did you have to pay him
"It's not a mistake"✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
To be accurate, he paid Snoop Dogg USD Dollar 🤣 420,069.00/- only!
Him:I just paid snoop Dogg thousands of dollars to do this Me:the world is pay to win Like Roblox games
I knew u paid him. No need to explain lol.
his flat face when he said "I just paid snoop dogg thousands of dollars" 🤣
This is what humans will be like in 10 years after being fully vaccinated by pfyzer. Emotionless
Never gonna give you up snoop dogg
Me looking at thumbnail: “Whattttt a shroud and snoop collab?”
It was worth the money at least 💰
Did he really answer you?
Is it faek
Fuckan awesome
Lol
I've never seen Davie this happy before
Is this real
Damn this is amazing
I’ve learned today. Dreams do come true if you pay thousands of dollars.
That wasn't worth the money
Snoop Dogg is one of the realest dudes ever..
Lamo. So what we learned in this lesson is that as long as we have enough money, not only dreams can be achieved, but other musical instruments can also be renamed bass
Yo waluigi?
Hey at least he met snoop
Why you look like you didn't slept for months?
WAIT are want to rickroller us??
Snoop is gonna end up seeing this one day and is gonna work with you for free next time.
Snoup Dogg
This guy is black listed from the Red Cross and blood banks.
Brilliant!
WOW
Shroud called he wants his everything back
Too easy🔥
Honest Davie
Hahaha
Agh!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
My respect for him for telling the truth.
Stay off the drugs dude ... Your eyes are LAZY af
Thumbs up for Davie’s bank account
Don’t give me no bammer weed , classic. Davey you sure can slap that bass, keep it up bro
AAAAYYYYEEE THAT IS AWESOME!
He looks like a Frankenstein version of Shroud.
👌🏾😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🎞📽🤪🙌🏿
Davie is basically SethEverman but with hair and a bass guitar
Bammer is a problem
🤣
Simplesmente o Metaforando fazendo feat com o Snoop Dogg...
it's not a mistake, ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
😂
Hey   davie what’s crackinlackin
❌it's not a Joke,it's a hazard!✅
Thank you kindly ✍️
🕺🏻
Did he do the devils letus?
just a reminder none of you are alone ! God is with you all and he will never leave you . you are loved and accepted by him and that will never change . God bless you all<33
😶ha😶ha😶ha
Good
His excitement is contagious
Didnt expected a twist like this 😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Damn, Shroud.
FINALLY! One of the only videos ive ever seen on YouTube where the person is honest! He paid snoop for that
Man Davie should play in the adams family that’s how much emotion he doesn’t have
🤣😭
The way he looks so dead inside
No one  Him: Ohmg
That's so awesome!
Smoke Weed Everyday
To be honest with a face like that I'd pay snoop thousands of dollars
Hey Davie what's crackalaking
Snoop dogg so baked he's turned into pam ayres....
This man is a literal vampire, I’m convinced he sleeps in a coffin with a giant castle way up on the mountains.
If you're wondering if dracula had any kids ... don't wonder
WHat
BRUH BESIDE SNOOP DOGS NAME THERE WAS A WRITING THAT SAYS ACTIVE NOW
This is what youtube was made for 😂
1 day I'll be like you😌
He looks like he's sick of living
Just goes to show you that if you have thousands of dollars than there is a remote possibility that your dreams may come true.
Nice
Are you Harstem?
I heard Dracula is looking for a butler, you may be interested in the position. Sorry man, I'm just joking.
Seriously though love that bass line
I didn’t expect to laugh hard at this, but I did
"I just payed Snoop Dogg thousands of dollars" Real fans know this is cap, because Davie is broke XD
How stoned is rhis guy 😁😁
You look like snoop dog and shroud
This is hilarious hahaha 😝
Why does Davie look like a vanilla version of count chocula
Damn double g gon' full acapella
Thousands of dollars:  Snoop Dogg: What's up baby?
Oooohweeeee that was hard you should turn that into a mastered song
Ayo 😳
Hi Rocky
It's not worth ,  bass guitar???? No man
Gotta love a twist ending
Your sanpaku eyes are scary
You look like you haven’t slept in 26 years
What a charming guy
Never gonna give you up never gonna let you down
I love the "O mg."
Ayyy bet you didn't know that last line is a RBL Posse reference!
Reach for your dreams nothing can stop you, unless you don’t got thousands of dollars then reach lower to fit your budget
Nice dude 😎🤘
I love you because you faked it. Made it seem real, and then made it all a funny legit joke that turned out to be very funny and got my subscription
Thanks for the advice mr bean
I didn’t know that they liked rap in Transylvania
You can see the death and dread in his eyes
Are we going to ignore the andoid ringtone?
Budget shroud
Budget Shroud.
how do real life vampires have YouTube channels?
It is not mistake it is master piecie
Art 🎨 👏
That's... Totally worth it. I see nothing wrong with this lol
Yeah I could tell this was some halfvassed cameo jizzle
That plot twist at the end... broke my heart
If success were a person, that person would be Davie!!!
Snoop be as high as possible
Just gotta give snoop time and he’ll deliver, his quest log is full enough as it is.
Sick
LMAO
Is this count Dracula?
Is this guy okay!?
It just goes to show what dreams and thousands of dollars can do
Davie504,now slap it on a NFT.
Number 5000
This is a literally legend of a video can’t wait till it has millions more views
"Its not a mistake", ✨️ITS A MASTERPIECE✨️
That plot twist
So talented! The rapper of course!
The moment snoop dogg started talking I already knew he was paid for it, but was still good
That absolute look of drained humanity with the soulful bass gives me hope
Wtf is wrong with eastern Europeans? It's like they all have a part missing.  Creepy emotionless weirdos...
When Seinfeld meets snoop dogg, sounds terrible lmfao
Bro gets some sleep!
That RBL Posse reference was 👍
Hey Davie will u have snoop to holla at me bout pimpin out my caddy. We can call it caddy by snoop. Maybe snoop caddy
This guy looks like Lurch
Your lucky bastard to get Snoop on like that
Hahaha omfg, you are the king! Until i heard u had to pay him 🤣
🗣🗣🗣SSSNOOOOOOPPPP!!!!  🐕
How do I start playing the guitar. I've played trumpet for 3 years and it wasnt that hard. Is learning guitar harder? I seriously dont know where to start other than paying for lessons. But I really dont want to do that just yet. If anyone could give me some tips that'd be great
Definitely worth every cent only a few thousand to have him rap your name over a beat for me ….. I would shit and fart and cum
Love the ending....lol
i was worried that you were about to pretend like you didn't buy a snoop dogg cameo. mad respect for making it into a joke
WURD!
Ice
😆
Worth every penny.
Who likes minecraft

Ricky Berwick and Davie, two chillest meme overlords of Youtube.

Daveyyyy
Who thought Snoop really did clown after a deranged fan non-stop persistently sent emails and request?
is this guy dutch?
Love it!
Gg shroud 👊
😂😂😂 The twist at the end is fire
Snoop Dogg's freestyles are so wack. Terrible investment
what a nice girl 👍
Snoop is a badass rapper
This is the best
Dave insomma, guardavo un tuo video, quando mi chiama mia nonna e mi dice che ha perso il telecomando...mentre stoppata la tua bass face nello screen. Insomma slap bass nonna.
Snoop dogg vs Cold dogg
You just gave a giant anti semite thousands of dollars. I wouldn't brag about that but you do you.
Now that your dream of collaborating with Snoop happened, you can now concentrate on getting cured of your mono. One of the worst cases of mono I’ve ever seen.
Funny plot twist🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's incredible you pulled this off even even you did pay. Keep up the great content. And everyone down forget to slap like now!!!
“Don’t give me no bammer weed” snoop lame stole that from RBL Posse from Frisco. That goof can’t be more unoriginal even in a freestyle

RBL Posse: bammer weed song. The original bammer song. 🔥🔥🔥
How much did you pay him? I sent Snoop Dogg a wicked Triangle riff for him to jam on but didn't get any response.
Premium content. Double thumbs up.
More likely had a hot box jam session .😆😆
That was almost as lame as Spenny's rap with Johnny Crack.
This was great lol
Davey davey how much did you pay snoopy?
Ok but is anyone seeing the resemblance to Waluigi here?
I've never seen davie so happy.
It’s not a joke it’s a hazard
This was the best ever. I can't imagine how snoop feels to have been featured on a Davie song!
Sometimes you just need to pay for your dreams

Damn snoop did you dirty with the lazy lyrics 😂
😭😭😭😭
Trash
This comment was made by a member of the violin gang 🎻🎻🎻🎻🎻🎻 bass=L 🎸🎸🎸
I never understood how Snoop was considered a gd rapper?! I can write better lyrics than him and you prlly could too. He's straight trash. Also a narc.  Prlly hasn't been in the hood in 30yrs. He's just an elite class puppet. Bought n paid for mad long ago. Does and says whatever the ruling class tells him to. He whack af. Smh
Thousands of usd dollars of america
*Daviieee!* 👋
TOO EASY
And here I thought nearly 2 decades of doing art will get me somewhere... Welp, better get comfortable with being a lost cause
Takes money to make money!
Okay, shroud look alike
Paid thousands of dollars and Snoop still couldn’t be bothered to not record like a middle aged mom doing a face time.
You look like the love child of shroud and Sylvester Stallone
OH EM GEE
You remind me of a young and skinny Sylvester Stallone.
I thaught that was Shroud for a sec
Ayo😳.  Damn
Two legends combined
Old times
Awesome! I’m lovin’ the “Bammer weed” reference!!! If you don’t know, “bammer weed” is a song by RBL Posse, a SF Bay Area Group!
This entire video is magnificent art, in more than one sense of the word
He said mane, not mate
At least Davie is honest. Haha
Amazing. xD
This dude looks like Dracula
what is shroud doing here
Shroud?
Kinda mad Snoop didn’t incorporate “baby gravy” with Davie
Dracula and snoop finally what I needed
He’s not saying mate. Don’t u know words?
So when will I make a collab with Eminem
Every single its not a mistake its a masterpiece comment is see i will report
Bruh I thought this was shroud wtf
🤣🤣🤣
It’s always about that money
Man shrouds lookin depressed
I hate using this word, because it's over used for things that aren't actually...epic. But this ...This was truly Epic.
That was cameo?
Lmao!! 🤣 it was the sweetest thing till the end 😆 still happy this collaboration exists no matter how
I'm getting sleepy just looking at him 🥱
Low-key fire old school snoop type beat
You look like the tech guy from suits
That Snoop verse was actually pretty sus... Davie Davie I drive you crazy, baby? Wtf
Sh*t slapped, but man this aint no worth for couple of thousand😂
Honestly it’s the same difference cause you can’t acquire thousands of dollars that you’re able to throw away without hard work and determination.
Insightful 🤣
SPEED OF KIRB WITH BASS CHALLENGE
SPEED OF KIRB WITH BASS CHALLENGE

This makes me sad.
Once I was walking by the street and I found a little kid crying. I just stopped, sit by his side and said: "don't cry, you can do whatever you want". Then, I get up and went away.  This kid was Snoop Dogg.
This video reminds me of the time I finally made love to the woman of my dreams
Snoop can add flavor to anything!
This guy looks like he hasn't slept for months
Borat?
Its crazy catchy haha
Literally looks like Sasha baron Cohen in talladega nights 🤔
I thought Shroud was just good at gaming
I dare you to play foundation and empire by level 42
Either snoop is really bad or he litterally put no effort in that rhym
Lmao this is a lie
Lol yes is that real? Thats awesome
I subscribed
Snoop has some lyrics But this... It was crap
Suaranya mirip livai njirr

Hahahaha
"money can't buy friend ship"  Snoop dog: yo davie what's crackin lacking man
Everybody in this video is displaying no emotion
Snoop Dogg is a homosexual that is just trying to put his finger on you. That may be lost on you, because you're a smelly foreigner.
When did Dracula get a YouTube channel? 🤔
И кто, блять, сказал что чёрный торчёк, лапочащий какую-то несвязную хрень под примитивный бит это музыкально?
Was this on cameo?
When he is said thousands of dollars Me: ......
Its Rocky's brother for sure
3 style didn't even writ for it
This could be a good hit
The first one is snoop but the 2nd one is not
Snoop dogg is a washed up old fool
0h man this is actually good!
"Never giving up" Me:hmmmm....... *RICKROLL MOMENT INTENSIFIES*
Legend.
Anyone else think it was a young shroud from the thumbnail? Lol
NuBbb

Plot twist: he actually paid Snoop Dogg
Snoop Dogg looked like he hated doing that
I swear if someone doesn't hire u to play a role on the next Adams Family movie imma break some shit
"I paid thousands of dollars" A few years later "Congratulations davie you earned one million dollars! "
Do be hittin' that bong when talkin' with Snoop Dogg.
Dang bro, that's the truth it's sad... I would've  rocked that for you for free
Be sure to believe, have faith and trust God and and repent of your sins so that when he comes back if you have been doing these you have been saved already.  and all sins are forgivable (except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.    and don't worship the antichrist when he comes he will force the world to worship and give them the mark of the Beast which doesn't let you go to Heaven.  And I'm not forcing you by the way God did give us free will 😎👍                                                     But it is better to know God before he comes back with wrath  And Jesus was nailed onto a cross because of our sins and he lived a perfect and sinless life and he isnt mad that we were the reason he died on the cross, after he died he was brought back to life and he wants us to put our faith in him and to trust his sacrifice so when we die we can enter Heaven.  And we can Know while we are still here. Don't let Jesus be a stranger to you. Don't let him   say "Depart from me for I do not know you"  But let him say   "Welcome home my good and faithful servant"  Have a Great day!   Sorry if I annoyed you   Summed up  don't worship antichrist (the one who gives a marking if you do (the mark being 666) if you do, you will go to hell later. And have faith in Jesus Christ to go to heaven  God has answered some of my prayers and I've felt the Holy Spirit and hes sent me signs and there are Bible prophecies that have come true).  Believing is more than just saying God is real it's when you have FAITH and when you TRUST God and when you OBEY God and have NO DOUBT in God as well. And it's also very important to bulid a relationship with JESUS CHRIST. And good faith leads to good works  And saying things like oh my G*d and Jesus Christ (when you dont need to and that applies for both) is a sin but it's forgivable but just because a sin is forgivable doesn't mean you should commit it that's abusing Gods grace/forgiveness or it could be and the same applies for cussing
That all it takes ? Awesome. Snoop's next single is going to be an ode to that weird shit I took the other day after eating oysters with ketchup.
Believing and making others believe that if u work hard you're going 2 be successful without question is the biggest lie of all. U also gotta be lucky, your name's gotta be written in that small book with the names of the successful, and if it's not, well... Doesn't matter how hard u try, doesn't matter 4 how long, doesn't matter how good u are, because nothing's gonna happen.
Epik collab
I just want to like my dreams is to sing with Kylie Jenner and Megan Thee Stallion and Ariana Grande 😔

You didn't make that bassline thats RBL posse's song "don't gimme no bammer weed" you can't just take credit for other people's work but you're still very talented and nailed the song
He's the type of person to say "Congratulations on winning" and then go "it was just luck"
Your are going to make a song with him
For how simple the freestyle is, snoop knows the way to make it SLAP

But to pay snoop dogg thousands of dollars you need to work very hard and not give up
Kkkkkk....You paid ....kkkkkk
That sould be a song I would like it
Epic collab
loser
Snoop Dogg also sent me this:  The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.  Strategy His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand. The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells. A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more. The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball. However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter. Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible. It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King’s Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value. In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation. Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage. When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings. Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building. Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox. If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique. For Bats, Skeleton Dragon, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon,  Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa. They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower. The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push. A Tornado placed on the second tile  front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower. This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower. The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it. A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower. Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense. The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is. A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily. A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough.
He looks like the Turkish actor Kemal Sünal!  ŞABAN!!
Hahahha
The way he said he paid him i was like 😐

This will make SD famous 💰 lucky you bro 👍
Bring some expression in ur face bruh 😆
My bro is sad btw u talking

U really sent snoop dog 200 bucks and he sent you that shitty video? 🤣
“It’ll take you real far” Snoop looks off into the distance

I always wondered what count chocula did the rest of the year when he wasn't busy making that Halloween cereal  Bass guitar nice good to have hobbies

🤣🤣🤣🤣
Snooooooop....😂🤍
I can’t stop listing ing to those 😝
“Davie davie what’s up baby”  Sus
Looks and sounds like bruno Fernandes
You look like a sketchy minecraft youtuber.
Shut up with this, not everybody on a daily basis can't contact these celebrities because they make it impossible but at the same time we are the ones who put money in those pocket but donchave the respect to keep in touch with your fans that got you were you are in the first place. So please don't start that American dream shit, its way over rated like most of these artist....
What a load of shit
OK, the ending is somehow heartbreaking.
Whoever this Snoop Dogg guy, he do be livin' the best moment of his life because of this amazing collab with Davie504.
“I just paid Snoop Dog thousands of dollars to do this” me 👁👄👁
Wooooohoooo
His so chill.
I don't  think Snoop Dogg puts a lot of effort into anything.....he should be honored to hang with Davie504 !!!!
His hair style is actually-😂
Daveey!
Useless
Now ask Snoop to make a rap where he's not allowed to mention his name
Hey I hate you Chanel and love watching 2setviolin and I know a couple of you vids are being rude and doing the challenge they gave you but you acted like you are actually doing the violin but you were not so you are a faker
I love snoop dog

At the end , everything is about MONEY!
Lol the way he is emotionless while saying "omg 😐" 😂💜
It is squidward in person.

Pieeee to kiiiii kok getinggg akuuu
I’m not sure what I just witnessed here… but every time one of your vids comes across it never disappoints 🤣 You earned a new subscriber today! I also play bass and would consider it an honor to perhaps someday be mercilessly criticized by you personally sir! 🤘🏻🔥🎼
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Never give up on your dreams?       Never gonna give you up on your dreams Never gonna let you down on your dreams
Lucky Davie, gets to make a song with snoop dogg

Kinda Badass, sweet
The count makes music…since when
Alright
He called you baby and he doesn't need your money
The end man... My hopes

The most luckiest person 😭😭
Woody?
I've been had! as expected, my stupidity and his cunning mixes
😂😂😂
This dude looks like scuffed shroud

Dragi creștini, în aceste vremuri critice, Biblia ne spune că avem 3 eroi de urmat, pe Dumnezeu, Isus Hristos și Copiii lui Israel, ca exemple de urmat în viața noastră de zi cu zi.  Dacă în rugăciunile tale nu ai primit răspuns la ,,, A fi vaccinat sau a nu fi vaccinat ,,,, înseamnă că te-ai grăbit în rugăciuni ,,,, dar nu este nimic pentru că Dumnezeu i-a trimis pe copiii lui Israel pentru noi  Creștinii să-i urmeze!  Dar ce vedeți ,, toți Copiii lui Israel sau Vaccinați ,, ,,,, așa că să urmăm exemplul Copiilor lui Israel și să ne vaccinăm!  Dumnezeu să vă binecuvânteze că ați ales calea pe care trebuie să o urmăm cu toții!!  Amin Aleluia.  PS.  Crede si nu cerceta!! Pace tuturor!!
You paid him to shout you out. Hes on that we site you pay famous people to say things

SHEEEEESHHH
SUCKER you paid a crack head thousands of dollas for this lmfaooooo
Shroud from wish?
You don’t blink.  You are already dead.
Considering the things Snoop gets into with a big enough check, I'm not surprised if he actually got paid to do this.
i love It when he said omg

🤣🤣🤣🤣
That collab was epic
isnt this old content?
Wow, ive never heard of snoop before, this must really set him off real far
Snoop sux why would anyone wanna look up to him.

That was about the least amount of effort snoop could possibly have put into this lol
Hilarious 😂 😃 😄 😁 🤣 😸 😂 😃
How is he so focoused
Why u look like that
Snoop Dogg is the living proof that weed is only good
This shit rox
O M G 😂😂😂
Hello- For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. Repent, before it is too late. Jesus loves you.
Did he really pay snoop dog 😂
That's gay as f
Shroud?
that's a pretty nice dong
i member this. very sad.
Davie Davie EPIC slap like crazy weed!! 😂😂
Aren’t these super recycled?
Wow
Snoop dog will always be the og rapper
now we need an actual davie feature on a snoop song
This is probably Cameo
The plot twist tho was insane
Yo you kinda remind me of one of the guys from Gorillaz?? Like the animated versions. Just me?
Lyrics from a 3 year old brain.
Haha
Im convinced this guy is a vampire
SIUUU
Congratulations
Hi did you know snoop dog lived next to a school called holy innocents and that is my school

Bro really said, omg 😐
Metáforando tá diferente
Hi
Dracula is that u?  I didn't know Dracula could play the bass so well
You literally gave snoop a dope baseline and paid him thousands of dollars for him to basically rap about how he's pimping you. But cool for exposing his wack ass game.
Wow
Keep slapping that bass guitar, snoop doggy dogg with that caviar
davie davie wassup baby
How he's lookin at us...
This dude
Uhh am I the only person who thinks he looks like Spock😂
Bought
you made it......there is nothing left to do,.
Cameo will take you far.
Ayyyy don't gimme no bammer weed ! Classic lol
Davie: And one day, I got a msg from him. Msg: Hey Davie, what's *cHrAckAliKan-*
Omg you already got 10 m subs i Watch you like when you have 250 k subs
Honestly , I don't even know who is luckier to be able to make a song with the other person but I think that Snoop Dog is luckier cause not everyone is has the chance to make a song with Davie504

Ice cold 🧊 man

His face, He looks desspressed

Davie420

Ahahh
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq  Programmierer der Master K. I.                    .   .   .

He looks depressed
Bass guitar? He  almost stop playing
Lucky rapper
Did u actually talk to him
It’s not mistake, ✨ITS A MASTER PIECE✨
bro u r insane 🤣🤣🤣
Loll
wowie look at him helping aspiring artists, davie is such a nice guy for helping a small rapper like snoop get some recognition.    *Do you see how quirky I am? I made the joke about the famous person not being famous and davie504 helping the "totally niche" rapper. For you see, I am original and very creative. some could say that I am the funniest man alive. I cant believe that nobody else has thought of this incredible joke, I must be some sort of a joke anomaly. Somebody so hilarious that the common folk all around the world are unable to handle how hard I make them laugh and will actually die from suffocation purely from laughing so hard.*
Snoop dogg fans 👇🏻
didn't have to tell the truth so much 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Congrats Bro!! Good job!
He said his success story in the most depressing way possible.
Sounds like Dracula blah blah blah
don't give me no bammer weed is also a good song haha
shroud?
Mdr
Snoop bitch drags it down.
BASS
Snopp Dog will remember this for the rest of his life. Like imagine collaborating with Davie. Only a select few are worthy enough for this.
The way davie talks “ and one day I got a message from him 😐”
When you realize the video was old but then its GOLD
Your facee,, waittt!!  Owhh SHROUDDDDDDD KING FPS
Oxi Metaforando kkkkkkkk

Dang boi. The msg at the end hit heavy. Did not know u had to pay the man.
The most important thing is honesty  Be honest, son
He look more high then before
That snoop guy is a terrible rapper amateur. Davie should have collabed with actual celebrities, like the guys who sing that "im an island boyyy"
Both of them look high
When you paid snoop dogg…
🤣🤣🤣
Looks elated
David you are legend
I saw this vid when it only had 1 view congrats lmao on nearly a million lol
I like how he talks
Lmao
Snoop sounds gay calling another man a pet name. I knew the bitch has sugar in his tank.
This video made me chuckle
We don't deserve davie504
Are you from Armenia ?

I love how his videos always have plot twists 🤣
This is super good

That name ‘snoop dog’ sound like an 90 rapper lol
Dude, I respect snoop dogg and have a craze for his freestyle, but this one, I mean, paid thousands of dollars to get these lame lines? hell no man. perfect bass as usual btw
Cameo is a life saver
Ciao Davie come stai?
Lucky
Snoop Dogg is such a nice guy  He is rich so he didn't need that thousands of $$$, but still actepted it and did the collab
Please blink
I love eating mashed potatoes.
Goes hard
Snoooop

Very nice of him to work with small artists like snoop dog
This dude reminds me of count chocula 😂.
And let's call this "davie wavey"
Didnt he actually have to pay more for him to respond because snoop wanted a bit more?
Or you could have paid him on Cameo to do this
Haha!!!

This was definitely just those cameos lol
This song is fireee
That’s awesome davie 1212 snoop dog comin through

D-O Double G

Davie davie, dont gimme no bammer 🌲 that was hard
Yeah I remember that time when Snoop ripped you off
I absolutely love this...
U look like a virgin crackhead who lived for 30 years in his mother's basement
Best Collab ever
If they ever do a real life hotel Transylvania they better cast him... Those of you that know... You know...
Davie do another anime song suggestion Crossing field
wtf
👏🏼👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
He didn’t actually reach out to davie He just paid him on cameo
He was probably too busy snorting booger sugar off another thots twatt.. but, I do love some snoop d oh double G
Facendo miao prrr prrr, ti do crocchi Mi graffi/non te ne do più  Gli sgraffi, sputazzo pelacci, mi abbracci Io e tu mangiamo insieme  Ti affido: " a chi cazzo mi lasci" Simbiotica al cuore che ho Come-back come non so Restiamo insieme
He look like arca!
you look so tired 🥱
Do you have a soul?
😭😭😭😭
Probably a fiver request
Money doesnt bring you happiness, make your dreams come true. Money = dreams = happiness. Ive been lied to
This guy should be a bond villain
Honesty finally!
Whens the song coming out?
Snoop is just such a likable dude
OMG wow!
Has anybody seen enthusiasm anybody
My dream is to be that security guard who got passed Snoop's blunt and took a fat toke

Let’s see how many likes this comment can get
"The monotone omg" got me
😂😂😂😂😂
How can I reach out to artist
This shi actually super good
To this day I do not know what the hype is about Snoop Dogg.
Davie must be from new Orleans
Yep, Snoop has been thru the worst, yet still helps. He is class, and deserves respect.  Not like say Kayne, the WANNA BE SNOOP DOG.  AND OK, I DONT LIVE IN USA, I LIVE IN BC CANADA, AND EVEN UP NORTH HERE:. I CAN SEE, SNOOP IS THE REAL DEAL, BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.  WHAT DID KAYNE DO?   LOL.  IVE BEEN THERE SNOOP. BUT HAD TO GROW UP FOR MY KIDS, BUT YOUR THE MAN.  YOUR THE REAL DEAL.   MAD RESPECT TO WHERE ITS DESERVED.  GOOD FOR YOU SNOOP DOG.  THE " REAL ORIGINAL OG "
I love your videos because you manage to portray the charisma and emotion that characterize bassists
Why are u talking like an AI robot?
OML YALL WHEN IS IT DROPPING ???????
Love how he's helping out struggling rappers. Love this legend
Haha
Metaforando tá diferente kkkkkk
Ferhan degilmi la bu? Seri katil
Lmaoooo cameo be like
Why you sound depressed
Can we appreciate that h always look depressed
Wit money

Honestly doing a cameo is probably cheaper than actually having him record for real
It sound like baby in stead of davie but still like it
lol, love this bass
Your eyes bro wtf
Screw Snoop. He is a joke.
Don't give me no bammer weed.😄
So did he really paid snoop double gizzo to the izzo or is it a joke?
Did you really paid him?🤔🤔🤔
When he said "never give up on your dreams" I look back at both their eyes and they both look dead inside
He doesn't blink
5к $?….
Hol up  Snoop dog is alive?
every time i see a video of snoop he’s smoking😂
Why does he look and sound like the gay french guy from Talladega Nights?
I wasn't ready for the plot twist 😂
This brings a smile to my face
Hahahah
...
I wasn’t reading the captions and I heard I always wanted to make a son with snoop dog
Keep jamming’. Dave, your darkness is so bright!! Shine on us!
I can always say that thank God after breaking my neck and tearing the artery in the back of it 4 years ago I'm not a retard and a wheelchair
Love how he's helping out struggling rappers. Love this legend
Mais algm achando q era o metaforando falando em inglês
😂😂😂😂😂
How much did that cost ?
god DAMN THIS IS FIRE
Real ripkafish
Damn bro you seem very excited
Wack
Wow thats amazing! But u paid him:(
Why is this dude so monotonous
👏
I was about to say this looked like Cameo videos.
Wow I can’t believe snoop dogg paid Davie504 to make a song
Dogz snoop
You look like mr.bean and Ben Shapiro cross bred
The Plot twist got me high
At the end Maja he aagaya
Slap
Snoop is a nursery rhyme rapper
This is so dumb 🤦
Lol 😆 🤣 can your next collab be to add a vocal background track by Rudy Giuliani, something about smoking in front of the dildo shop...
DAMNN
Ea
That slapped super hard
first                                                 2999 replies
damn this sh bang
I love Davie 504
Your vibes feels like Edgar Allan Poe
Damn this slaps hard
I think you need to change your attitude
What a cool guy.
Would love to see a collaboration with you and Mononeon. :-)
That was great
Lol
Lol haha the end tho
Well done, Davie. Low effort from Snoop Dog though. :-/
"The bass guitar will take you very far" BARS!! 😂
You know that kid from meet the robinsons that was in the Orphanage he came a long way☝️💯😂😂😂😂
White Dracula ft Snoop dog- 2 ways to die

Davie davie wassup baby 😳🥵🥶
Dracula
He is so funny !!!!!!
🔥🔥💯this really fire tho
good one shroud
XD
i love that he has no signs of life whatsoever lmfao
"OmG"
I can’t believe Snoop would allow this rap to makes its way into the public sphere. My nephew just made a better rap while I was typing this
tbh he looks like a vampire now 😂
Haahaa very cool Davie!
Even the terminator doesn't talk as robotic as this guy.
No it's not
You can tell snoop didn't give 2 shits and didn't give 0% on that freestyle!
Yo u milk gang or no
🤣🤣🤣
Hahahaha
Hahahahhahah🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you and God bless...
This guy can rap, maybe he should be a rapper
Man I love eastern Europeans. Most bored look a human can put on there face: "today was the happiest day of my life." 😕
My mom has the same birthday as snoop dog
F snoop the sellout ...
🤣
That there is the face of a phyco
Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent you shall be saved give it a try I mean accepting Jesus is a great thing cause if you do your safe from hell you might think hell isn't real but it is and heaven isn't boring ppl think heaven is boring but in fact, you can fly in heaven accept Jesus as your Lord and savior repent and always remember God does Love you........
Dat bassline is actually una figata della madonna
Smart business. You made that money back x5000
Snoop dog 🐕 🤣  You paid a dog
*"'saves video
"Davie, Davie wassup baby... big Snoop Dog & I'm driving crazy"... 🙌👌
Kept expecting count von counts laugh at at at
the funniest part is how much emotion he shows 😂
When snoop Dogg dies I will legitimately feel sad
Davey, you need to turn down the enthusiasm.
Never gonna give you up
Getting a response from Snoop Dogg is more likely to happen than getting your comment loved from Davie. Davie is a legend, true musician. I remembered one time my comment was liked by C.T. Fletcher long ago on facebook. At the time, it was a very rare occasion.
You better make that your new outro
Snoop Dogg such a rapper dude 😎
Cazzo che figata
Snoop Frog is a liberal sell out and a hack.
Perfect
I don’t know why it made me feel weird when he said Davie Davie
Yeah cameo has been making it easy for fans to sort of get a chance to talk to or get custom messages from their favorite celebs saving up to get a custom JOI video from one of my favorite celebs 😋
Rudy is that you?
I love me some Snoop Dogg! Great American!
We want a long version!!!!
Last I laughed
His eyes looked painted on
Man’s is on to bigger and better places now
That’s wassup shit we would all love it if a celebrity acknowledge us
In 90’s fashion: that’s stupid yo!
Snoop Dogg is pretty cool But can you do it with a cantdog?
snoop is epics !
hey why are you always sleepy?
Shroud?
My boy is proof that you shouldn’t give up damn!
This is how Italians make collabs Hard work and                   *money aka Soldi*
we don't smoke that shit in the SFC
Lel the end 'I just paid snoop dog thousands of dollars
Make a son with snoop 😂
Honestly, I generally don't like you at all. But, that was cool. I'm glad for you.
when I'm giving my friends a motivation 🤣💪🏻
Ñ con esa cara de felicidad ha
i keep coming to listen it again hahaha
Nice.
Lol
Snoop dogg is 100% with the dlc on the game of life

Looks like he did it while taking a shit
''Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.''-{Ephesians 4:32}
Snoops raps are lame

“For this is how God loved the world: He gave His One and only Son Jesus Christ, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life. God sent His Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through Him. There is no judgment against anyone who believes in Jesus. But anyone who does not believe in Him has already been judged for not believing in God’s One and only Son." John 3:16‭-‬18  ❤
Dude it's clean
You're so funny. Hha

All jokes aside, did you actually pay him to make this?
This is like the moment in The IT Crowd when Doug Reynholm says 'I really wanted a helicopter so I looked at the stars and wished as hard as I could.... and then I went and bought a helicopter!'

Lucky dogg

Dope
I couldn't find out what was off in this video until i realized that he wasn't wearing his headphones. Keep up the good work pal 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When davie 504 left home at 18, he stopped in the doorway and told his father, you are the man of the house now.

BRO THE ENDING 😂

So is this not the depressed kid from meet the Robinsons?
That’s amazing and I’m so jelly
Lol, looks like snoop filmed that first vid the same day he filmed that ridiculous super annoying blackout bingo ad. 😂
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Couldn’t have paid him too much. Lol cause those lyrics sucked.
Man literally sounds like Dracula🩸🧛‍♂️
And “money can’t buy happiness”
Metaforando?

Pika
Snoop Dogg is a living legend. Period.
He looks like 12 year old shroud
Amazing!
Lmao

You didn’t say slap like! I almost forgot
Rare video of snoop
I knew it was cameos😂
Why is he always so dead 😂😂
Da.....truth is free.😄😄
Does he always just look expressionless 😐
Slappin them strings !
Snoop obviously listened to RBL at some point.
Davie looks so excited
How can I get this on loop?
Anyone remember when snoop snitched
Believe it or not he's really excited guys.....just dead inside.
Did you actually paid him or cap
Kool
Nice
Snoop is soo high ,he probably dont even remember this,lol
Nice one mate respect and big respect to the boss
Nice cameo
Good job I'm proud of you!
Man is filming in the back of his RR
Davie is the kind of guy who sits in the bushes at night watching you from a distance
The otiginal beat is called dont gimmie no bammer weed by RBL posse
I need it on spotify🙊🙊🙊🙊
Lol
"OMG 😐"
Man that guy can rap. I bet he's gonna be a famous dancer someday.

First time I’ve seen anyone use their thumb playing bass and I’m a bass player lol
🤗🤗🤗🤩🤩🤗🤗🤩🤩🤗🤗🤗🤗🤩
Nice
Really curious if actually paid snoop dog for the verse
Did you actually pay him thousands of dollars
You are most depressive and cool youtuber in same time.
🤣🤣🤣
I want to see him do a Vinny impression
This dude looks like Nosferatu
Cool
Hahahahaha
My dream is to smoke a joint with wiz berner and snoop that would be amazing 😂😁
My dream is meeting snoop dogg
Es la mera rebanada
Cause snoop a fucking rasist
OK but why does Snoop Dogg always mention drugs on his songs, it's not even cool it's just promoting doing drugs, people are stupid and *will* do drugs of famous people make it out to be cool
unironically was complete crap and literally phoned in.  your bass-playing, however, is nice. snoop dogg is overrated and lazy.
Imagine get paid thousands only to record yourself saying "davie davie its big damn me" while you are almost asleep of weed overdose
Los odiadores que sigan odiando
HA GAYYYYYYY !!!!
I really don't know  how you made in in rap
Russian guy
😂😂
Omg u look like a famous turkish comedian. His name is Kemal Sunal better known as Şaban

Im convinced this guy is Dracula trying to blend in to our timeline
Is that true?
big snoop with that RBL shoutout
He sounds like the guy that’s been shutting peoples festivals off talking about “all I need is love tonight.”
You look like me everyday when I walk out of my house to go to work.
Snoop Dogg cut you a break, don't forget it!

I sneezed right when the water effect on the screen happened and I was like “OH NOOOOOOOOOOOO” for a good two seconds
We know he’s lying with the 1000, he probably sent him a package of magical flowers
🤣🤣🤣
Dope to see Davie giving young up and coming artist some attention 👍
Lmao the fact you admit that you paid him makes this better
It bugs me how he thinks he’s saying mate or m8. He said “mane” (main)
Hes not saying m8 he said mane
He said mane , this guys mind , oh he said m8
That was the most lifeless “omg” I have ever heard 😂
Hey, next time Snoop may invite you to his studio for a collabo or sumthn 💯❗ Keep up the good work 😊.
This was great👊💯❗ David, you're very talented. Don't stop❗ Don't give up👍❗
Bro move your fucking eyes
I felt like I was being seduced while watching this
Good job
I like how he looks emotionless and dead inside ..... rlly cool guy

Ending was TRULY unexpected
I love this man
THE FUCKING ENDING XD
“am grue”
He took a long time because he was getting chicken wings
he said bass guitar wtf
Good for you DAVIE
Make it a full song it's sounds really good
That's because he had no weed and a slight moment of clarity insued....
Fun fact, he’s saying “mane” not “mate”
RBL reference
Count Dracula? Is that you?
He looks dead on the inside
Money talks, and that bass line walks Two balls made a pitch, four balls made that wish  Come true come true, Snoop and you Davie davie, it’s crazy crazy.
Ha...Snoop just made 8 million off it...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He sounds like the guy that’s been shutting peoples festivals off talking about “all I need is love tonight.”
Still, you cannot buy friends or friendships! I wish all of you a very warm & very joyous holiday season! Yuletide! Christmas!! New Year!!! from Great Britain. (Mon 27 Dec 2021 18h24)

Yeah that’s the way Snoop is cracking ‘freestyle’. Thinking about it few weeks long. Then writing it down. Then reading it. Such a talent. Such an icon huh.
What’s up with His dead eyes?
I guess you ve already been told already that you look like Frankestein. !
You cool but damn smile a little, looking like a low budget Russian actor.
That was the vague snoop coming though
You are trending in India

Dude looks like the count from sesame street
Im actually super not impressed with how lazy snoop went with this
And you make pretty good videos :)
You’re actually funny :)
i wish i coulda collabed with a murderer
You didn’t make that bass line.
It’s funny because the song has potential if snoop took it serious
Paid him thousands of dollars: snoop still uses a horrible camera
Lmmaaaaaooooo
This video has 6500 Dislikes! Finally i can see them back with the browser extension!
🔥🔥🔥✊🏾
I'm pretty sure he says mayn and not m8, I don't think I've ever heard an American use the word mate 😂
*This dude looks already high before even snoop Dogg is in contact with him* 😂😂
Are you tired why your face look like that.hahaha
Haha most don’t know what he said at the end “don’t give me no bammer weed” real Cali killas know he shouting out rbl posse 🔥
Just remember davie, dont EVER give him no bammer weed

Yo this is why snoop is the shit!!!
"Keep slappin that bass guitar, gonna take you real far" 🤣🤣 there is your 1000 dollars gone to waste Davie
You said "work hard" where Is the work hard??
"Don't give me no bammer weed." - RBL Posse
What’s the one thing will you get every year on your birthday, guaranteed?        A year older.
I don’t know why I thought this was so funny but definitely got me at the end when he said I just pay snoop thousands to do dis 🤣
"money can't make happiness" Also him :
@Davie504   Keep tickling those round wounds. Now if you could get Maceo Parker on board with Snoop? That would be a serious jam session.
We all know you paid him to say that 😂
Plot twist at the end 😂
Nice.
Fantastic black dog.
That bass line was sick snoop killed the first part but ending was a bit eh surprised he didn't edit it.
Ayooo😂😂🤣🤣
Pretty sus rap ngl

Your happiness is touchable, came out of the screen and slapped me in the face
The end tho 😂
The ending is awesome.
That end shook me
God richly bless everyone reading this and May you have blessed, Spirit-led and impactful week, in Jesus mighty name, Amen 🙏🏽 ❤️✨
He gives me vampire vibes
One of only two ways I’ll smoke a joint is with snoop if I ever meet this man in elevator I’m telling him that having a joint with him is a bucket list item
He looks so high
At least he admits it.
METAFORANDO TÁ DIFERENCIADO
Cameo has evolved quickly
Snoop will sell his mom for a couple of G's.
Annoying

Dang if every song had a bass line like this,  today’s music would be so much better imo. Shame that Davie still doesn’t get all the recognition he deserves
Nice having snoop dog by your side. Really nice song
Ryan has seen better times
Omg it’s shrouds brother
That is a flat out 10/1
This is insane  Bruh
He looks like Dracula but, awesome

Ya boi be cappin
"You can't buy friendship."  Davie: "Observe."  "Hey Davie what's crackilackin! It's Big Snoop"
You just can't not like Snoop Dogg, he has that awesomeness about himself. Thank you Snoop Dogg that was really cool.
By how this guy acts I just image he has ADHD and depression and this is the outcome 😂 I’m sorry i know im not funny but I can’t get that image out my head—- lol
Davie is so fucking based it’s unbelievable, no pun intended
DIAMOND YOUTUBE PLAYBUTTON BASS!!!!!
Word snoopdoggydoo coming through for you
thats amazing
"Snoop will do any gig for money" Exhibit six thousand four hundred and seventy two
Biggest blot twist since, "I am your father."
Worth it! I found you :)
Just like darrman but funnier
Se parece a un profesor que tuve. Era de literatura.
Wonderful :)
Why would you give Snoop Dogg thousands of dollars just to s*** in your cereal and you think it's marshmallows?
Very cool lol
WHATS HIS NUMBER!?!? IM A BIG FAN
Sounds a little like. Elements of Lakeside  "Fantastic Voyage" just a little
This guy look lik the giant in Adams family
this guy reminds me of Viktor from arcane
Hes not saying MATE
Viktor plays bass. who knew?  jokes aside, good stuff! :D
Dang the twist
All I can say is at least he replied to the message that's pretty down-to-earth happy New Year drinking in moderation
The "Owh em gee" 🤣
😁😂😂😂
Bro u look like you need some sleep
Idk the lyrics kinda gay
Davie looks dead
What this story has taught us is: Never gonna give you up
Twist 🪢🪢
Man looks more stoned then snoop himself
Snoop Look today a little Bit Like the black Tiger King
Wait, i think i know you from my stiker at whatsapps that i stole from my friend
You could’ve inspired me for doing something but you said you paid him💀
“don’t gimme no bammer weed”  only real ones know 😭
Epico.
You can buy everything including god
Is this Make-a-wish for vampires?
Jesus is the reason for the season
HAHAHAJAJA the twist!!
😂 I was gonna say, this sounds like it was a cameo
His daddy owns snoop
DAVIE THATS NUTS
😩😂😩😂😂😩😔😂❤️❤️👑👑👏👏
Why does this go so hard
But he says Guitar. Slap him
Snoop is a liberal tool , F that fool 👎
So Uhm,,, Should We Call Y'all Snoopie Or Davoop?
This is insane! I love your content 1 video in🔥
those shorts are so lazy.... just go back to your fire videos and stop beeing lazy
Davie: how much to get you in the studio Snoop: a couple or few million Davie: how bout thousands? Snoop: im smoking right now but i got you
Found dracula
God loves you✨ Jesus saves give him a chance.
Hard to believe he came up with those epic lyrics and only many weeks
Are you using eroin every day ?
Saint Joseph. Terror of demons.    Pray for us..        ...       ....
❤️❤️
Saint Joseph. Terror of demons.    Pray for us..     .....     .....
Caralho  O metaforando do EUA
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAMN
This is sad because davie paid a lot of money just to get an improvised, not well made, low effort rap, and if you saw the original rap without Davies's editing you would see snoop taking words from a song he's listening to just to fill up some words
Who cares 👎
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life0
OMG Davie, I just saw a video of yours for the first time in more than 6 months, how I get unsubscribed, I resubscribed
I heard it again after sending the msg and its definetly a hit
Was this "Bust A Move"? sounds like it.
Thinks he’s saying m8 instead of maybe lmao
U can now go to sleep after that
Are you Estonian?
Man, this is fire! You must make a complete song with that
Man this gy does deserve 10m subscribers
It’s funny how it seems like snoop did it for free awww what a special story then he says I paid him thousands. Like most ish ain’t free…lol
DAVIE DAVIE🤣🤣
Just admit it! You promised Snoop to turn him into a Vampire, too.
Snoop is awesome 😎
What....? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I just paid him🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's pretty sweet
Fireeee
Why this dude look like nosferatu wtf
Mm is bussin
"you can't buy friendship" Davie: "hold my beer"
😂😂🔥
You know a man’s reached giga chad when he collabs with snoop dogg himself
He lowkey scares me
Fun fact: Snoop and Elton John are really good friends
That song was so amazing!!!!!!!
This dude look like he does not give 2 shit with out thinking twice
deymmmmm
I knew it .... 🤣
Snoop dogg was tryna get his joint rolled
❤️❤️❤️❤️

Lame
🙂 Hello, friendly reminder that Jesus loves you and wants you to repent so that one day heaven will be your home. 🙂 Be sure to share this with those you care about. 😇
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The end part was the most funniest part when you said he payed him
You're like the Seth Everman of bass. Emotionlessness , smooth humor and amazing music.
That twist lol
Plot twist: Davie is actually The Counts little brother 🧐
Now this is good.
Snoop Dogg is so lame.
Goddamn your guitar sounds amazing
Metaforando???
Make WORSHIP SONG TO GOD FOR YOUR ETERNAL LIFE NOT FALSE IDOLS FOR ETERNAL.HELL..
You payed him to say that
This guy's emotionless expression makes me laugh each day. Is he trying to be funny or-
Turns our Fiver is a good collab with celebs

You know snoop don't like snitches, davie. Fr tho, thousands of dollars and you get back that low effort shit. I'd be bugging the shit out of him.
Snoop Dogg told it's a bass guitar??.... Davie what's up 😂
Nice to see Lurch from the Adams Family transition into hip hop.

We must respect all who support new talents ❤️ Our love to Snoop dogg.
Moral: work to get money to pay a celebrity to make a song with you
Congrats
I immediately knew you paid him through Cameo or something like that 🤣🤣 just how quick he was talking in that first clip.
how much was that cameo lol
Ahhh I was reading the comments before I watched the video, and no one said "spoiler alerts" and now I'm sad because they spoiled the mind-blowing twist near the end. 😢
That's 100% just a cameo
That was rad asf Davie
"Never giving up on your dreams" My mind:      *Never gonna give you up never gonna let you down*
DAMMMM
Comments failure is not a big deal ! As long as the policy does not fail it's ok!  but Let the virus enter the country, lockdown  of Xi'an city ! Whose policy is this? Whose failure?
"Don't gimme no bammer weed" 😂😂😂😂😂
Good man Snoop ☺️
Lol
I watch this at 456k likes…Squid game reference?!!
Its the boring face and motivational talk for me
I love you Snoop

Groovy

me quietly laughing at the ending. Hehe!
What a plot twist-
Wait is this real
I respect David for the resting bitch face I have the exact same face When I’m not smiling
Davie, Jesus is coming back soon, are u READY?? My family and I are having dreams of Jesus return. Enough phones and social media and go out and preach the gospel. God bless

HI Manny!

So sweet ,making dreams come true like a make wish kid.
Lol the twist
*AWESOME*
As Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau said! Western groups need to get together to cancel the digital tax! Let American enterprises no longer pay taxes to every  governments!
The actuall part that he paid thousands of dollars for 2-8 lines of words
Snoop Dog should be paying you Davie <.<
You have no emotion 😐
Lol

Haha that’s so cool
That was borderline a love song.
Why do you sound so damn depressed
Hilarious!!!

Let's give a salute to this guy for making a lot of videos just to make us happy
Hello wadzee but havent eaten in one week
The end tho
Love the end
Davie is lucky
this is so EPIC!
How do you prevent the buzz on the bass? (You sounded so great with Snoop, by the way)
Damn bro! 🔥
idk why but Davie looks like a somewhat slimmer Sylvester Stallone to me
Epic 😅😅👌
Lol weed 🌿💨💨
😂😂😂
Davi Jones???
I need just the bass line  My life might depend on it
That epic
I was gonna say, looks like a bunch of cameos lol
Georgio, is that you?
Who is the man Davie is jamming with? He's got some talent. Maybe he will be a famous artist someday just like you Davie!
So..this guy is from gta 5..IT'S THE IRL DAVEYYYY! he is probably sick of dark viper crashing a blimp
My man is still murdoc but white
*D A V I E D A V I E*
when all else fails, in my hour of deepest need, when nothing seems to work... i will pay snoop dogg thousands of dollars. Emotional lesson, thank you . prayer emoji.
Is David the actor who played the French guy in Talladega Nights?
🤣
He paid him🤭nah 🤦
Has to be the new outro
👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
this baseline beat snoooooop dog hard
This man looks like he belongs at hotel Transylvania or some shit
I'm glad he's Roomy officials husband
Davie would you happen to know Seth Everman?
I love this guy
Bro, if you could make a TooL inspired bass line that would be too sick!
When are you going to respond to Ricky miers  video i want to see your first banjo v bass video!!!!!!!!!!’
I do actually believe this
Dude, that's badass!

Snoop dog is still alive?
😍😍
That was funny 😆 edited tho🤣🤣
how many grand did you pay snoop dogg?
That's goob from Meet the Robinsons? right😸
blackout bingo is a fasho sho
Snoops politics suck but his raps mostly do not suck
SLAP !!!
U look dead
he only does shit for money
omg.
He's gone so bohemian mellow since collabing on decorative pattern print long lighters with Martha Stewart.
😂😂😂😂😂
Do you paid him really?
🧛‍♂️
My 80 yo dad with alzeimers  dribbles better shit than what Snoop gave you,always considered him overrated proves me right
“Oh em gee”
Man
I hope you go on tour with Snoop as his official bassist
Respect for him saying he paid snoop. You can do this on a website where you pay “famous” people to say stuff
Davy has the eyes of a dead fish... scary but true.
That's pretty cool... Bwahaha oh nevermind
I’m updating my New Years resolution now…a collab. with Snoop!
That shit went hard davie davie dont give me no Bammer weed
Fala português metaforando do caraio
The song is sick thoooo
I hate snoop dogg 😈👎
YOOOO. ITS BEEN AGES. Forgot abt this guy. Prob been a yr. whys he not on my recommendation?
Shrouds brother?
I’m really happy
The ending tho
Your face does not look that excited it just looks dead (no offense)
Snoop Dog was Judas to Tupac.
this guy sounds like levi
Give me snoops #
That's too honest Davie 😩🤣
EDITTTTT
I predicted the future when I knew the plot twist in the end
Dude, you are not for this....
Fuego 🔥
He like a vampire no offense
Davie Davie … what’s up baby lol 👌🏾
Why do you sound soul less
Legendary
Epic
He kinda looks like a cross between Spock and a vampire
Lmao
He looks so tired, needs a lot more healthy sleep.
I too shall pay snoopy thousands to get a gesture
That freestyle is so skitz
Incredible. Ten stars.
It must have taken him.that time to come up with something in his free time
Bass guitar 🥲
Bruh you keep popping up on yt shorts-  Sure I like music but no thanks-
I was like wow that's so cool of snoop  When he said he paid him I was like: 😐
Y do you look depressed
Ur bassline sounds amazing.
big w
I pray anyone that sees this becomes successful
Not to be rude but you look like you sell your soul to get good with guitar
Yoooooooo
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love this guy
This is the ultimate origin story
Bro you from new orleans
🔥🔥
He had to gather up his power
Y'all have dreams 😅
What you need is a blow up doll...
🤣😂
He sounds like the guy that’s been shutting peoples festivals off talking about “all I need is love tonight.”
This is so cool
"All I need, is a Loooo-ooove tonight"... -immediately cuts power 😑. (iykyk)
Wonderful collaboration. Keep it up Davie!
I burst out laughing when he said that he paid Snoop Dogg (yes I know my humor is broken)
make a colab with Oliver tree lmao
I think David is the Pokémon go song kid
"Don't give me no bammer weed"                                 -snoop dogg 2021
That was a great mix 😋. Hope theirs more fun for your skills!
But what kind of dollars did you pay him? Maybe USD dollars?
He delivered a half assed product Davie.. Ya got gypped.. You carried the team on that "collab".
This dude is strange.
Count daviela
u sound like the french guy from taladega nights
Hahah “Dog know I just paid Snoop Dogg thousands of dollars to do this” 😢😂😂😂😂
That plot twist tho lol
That's kinda gay but it worked well lol
U look like an older version of shroud from twitch
Dracula?
Im pretty sure Snoop freestyles whole albums 😂👍
How to use Cameo
You sound sooooo enthusiastic 😆
It’s up to me it’s up to u. We gon do what we came to do.
Is Davie your last name
Lol X
Snoop dogg is cool
he said mane but m8 works too lol
in the end money solved all the problem.
Snoop trying to clean his act up a bit... He doesn't do this for money! He wants to show he can still jam.
😂😂😂
The absolute lack of emotions in this guy though
Look Eddie Munster…’you crazy but I dig your bass!
Snoop.....sigh.....washed up. Thinks he is clinton and the parliament p-funk now
E
That "OMG" got me
He looks so happy..
Damn he's never gonna give you up never gonna let you go never gonna run around desert you
why dose it feel lile hes saying the exact opposite of what hes talking about
“Never gonna give you up”
He was 100% high when he decided to collab with you
Thats crazy
Who is snoop dog ?
Get your money back
You know those rhymes were off the cuff, that was some doctor Seuss shit
You’re gonna go far kid
Wow
I was scroling short with ma other hand in my "banana", i watch this thing till the end and i almost break ma little jonny
😔
Lmfao. This guy looks like count chocula. And snoop dog took so long to get back to you because he's a no talent rapper. Think about it. There is nothing special about him. He's got no talent. It probably took him that long to make something up. Probably had to ask his daughter to come up with something.
Daaaa... that's a real banger beat!!
Dude you are the man!! Bass Slayer and hilarious 😂
I love how he put "m8" every time he said mang/mane that was cute 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If you look closely, you can see that Davie is overwhelmed with excitement
“ Keep slapping that bass guitar, it’ll take you real far!! Davie, Davie, don’t gimme no Bammer weed!?!? Really Shhnoop?? I mean it’s awesome/hilarious but if that was the end result of paying Snoop Dogg…😢
Nice boiiii
Boo you’re so bad
Next time he needs a throw a pie
Snooooooooop..
:0
Wow!!! That's real love
BASSed
He did good and brought me Good vibes thank you thank you keep up the great work I wish I could play but not very coordinated with my fingers and my hands to my brain but I love music
Dad from caroline
😂
Is he the dude that cut the power at that concert 😆
This is awesome.
Davie: *about to give up*  Snoop Dog: Never gonna give you up
Snoop actually will make a song with anyone who will pay. I’m from Serbia and this shitty singer made a song with him, the song makes no sense it’s so bad a nd Snoop is high as shit in the music video. It’s on YouTube ‘Ljupka Stevic ft Snoop Dogg- Ole Ole’ 😂😂😅
I like his song
Legends never die
Guys, Jesús is coming soon, repent

My dad is friends with the guy who designs all of snoop dogs album covers! I just found the out resonantly!
I bursted out laughing at the end. Thank you.
Snoops rhymes are preschool level and no one ever calls him out on it. "Hey, why don't I just go eat some hay, make things out of clay, lay by the bay? I just may! What'd ya say?" - Happy Gilmore or Snoop
did you PUT IN THE WORK PUT IN THE HOURS AND TAKE WHATS OURS AND TAKE WHATS OURS
repent Jesus is coming back not forcing though and he wants the best for you..................
Very sad how snoop dog payed Davie to cameo 🙄
Shit slaps
Not many people are going to believe me but that is 100% okay! So, my dad actually knows Snopp Dogg because he gave him a dog which is ours now! The dog is named Mona and she's a red nose pit. I believe Snopp Dogg has the brother of Mona! Anyways thanks for letting me share. <33
Snoop be getting that Cameo money.
True fans know what video this short is coming from
No you didn't :/ you don't have that kind of money
don’t give me no bammer weed we don’t smoke that shit in the slc
Hahahaha
That is Fantastic! Snoop Dogg is smooth as silk.
Davie davie what's up baby - cheers from PL, awesome! XD
Damn
What a legend!
he is a sell out
Oh man your thousands of dollars got wasted because of trash rap. Your bass was much much better.
He's not saying mate ( m8 ).. He's saying MAYNE... it's slang for MAN..what's up man. = wuzzz up mayyyyyne
Make an fullversion
Don't give up my dream "But will dad come home with milk"
Snoop Dogg actually sent you this... that is AMAZING
Legend
He spends so much usd dollars for this clips
Merry Christmas and Happy New year Davie!

If this guy had any emotions than I would take him seriously but until then I just can’t 😂😭
No hate or whatever but why does he look dead inside
Dude talks like a vampire
Lol I knew it was a cameo the whole time
Nani
That ending. I paid Snoop Dogg thousands of dollars 😂
I already knew it was a paid Cameo thing from that Cameo website at the beginning but I still like the video this was beautiful satire as well as promoting you playing the bass you have a career in both now
I love how he is so nonchalant
ARE U GOING TO MAKE THE DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON BASE WHEN U GET IT
Never Gonna give you up
🥃
Thanks for telling the truth! It takes money to make money
DAVIEEE!!!
Half way through this short, I thought someone pranked him paying Snoop through Cameo.
This is like the fucking real life bo rat

Still is good
Drippy

The end was shocking
Ok I don't see people talking about this but the paid collab actually sounded really good
So glad he sent you that video man. It's always hard work creating a quality channel that lasts seeing you get the Collab is awesome

Snoop is amazing...no matter what!
"Bass guitar"
Well his face shows a lot of excitement
You just got beaned
Nice work Dracula
Lol
Davie504 do u like acoustic guitars?
Do you think New Coronavirus is not from American laboratories? Anthrax virus is really from American laboratories! We all know where the anthrax letter attack after 9 / 11 came from! Let's continue to enjoy American performances!
The ending lol
😂
Davie!
Lmfao
I'm sad he didn't say "USD Dollars"
Because of snoop dog I have watched that 100 times.

Money makes many things... 👏
snoop  is saying man not mate...
Thet is my favourite sone ever 🥰🥰
Oh shit somebody knows RBL posse
EPICO!!
Hard work need money
😂😂😂😂😂
Well that was definitely not worth anything
Davie Davie feeling your girl up with baby  gravy
Why does he look and sound just like the vampire from Hotel Transylvania cartoon
I love your accent
Well that was shit. I would never waste my money for a celebrity. Sorry you got scammed :/  no wonder Snoop has to do shit like this online for money he has the effort of a brick
"Davie Davie" XD
Metaforando?
😂😂😂
And Davie hasn’t changed his tshirt since.
bla bla blah
Bruh 🤯🤯🤯
"davie davie wassup" that line is so catchy ngl
Hey davie, you got me into bass. Yea, i bit the bait, and now im hooked. Still trying to get the hang of chords, been playing a lot of Gorillaz and White Stripes music. But im steadily improving and hope one day i can be good enough to perform
Wow
Snoop lion*
Snoop has no idea davie is prolly as famous or more famous than him
oh no, it's only a Cameo? :,(
Hmm, you look excited today.
Lmfaoo I didn’t expect the end😂
U should do this with someone better it would good.
I love snoop
I can never tell if this guy is excited or high
Davie Davie what’s up baby 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This dude had no emotion ever 😂
Plot twist: he actually paid snoop dogg tousand of dollars to do this.
So basically his upper face is basically dead
Man that's so cool
If this is what it takes to fulfill your aspirations , you need to ask for more out of life. Any third grader could have done that.
Neat
Musician Shroud
Y  he looks) ke a vampire n talks like 1
It's Mr. Bean
i knew it
How about a bass banjo
Why is there no emotion from you ever? Is that an act or just how you are?
Metaforando tá diferente né
Snoop dog says anything and it sounds smooth
What the hell lol
I notice more and more lately, snoops got a good writer. Ik this was obv off the top, but God damn that was some awful rhymes..
😂😂😂
Dude that's not snoop dogg he is from long beach california us in fact he's not even from the uk
Snoops fucking laaaaaaaaaaame
maybe you will get to play bass on one of snoops songs
Using Cameo
money is always right
Next Eminem..please✌
Snoop dogg is so shit at rapping its actually hilarious hahaha go to bed you old man
The end omg money can buy happiness
Im glad Davie is helping out small artists like snoop
Davie Davie, don’t give me no bammer weed.
I like how not excited he is.
Is this the Human Igor from Winnie the Pooh ? So calm and chill yet so interesting and cool 😂
He kind of reminds me of the polkadot man from suicide squad
Jesus loves you! He dead for you!❤️
So he paid for two cameos and made a video pretending snoop actually responded to him without the cameo.
I would probably cry after receiving that shit rap knowing I have to make a video with it.
OMG
That plot twist makes me laugh 🤣
Great
Jesus Christ
Can't stand Snoop!!!!!!l!🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤢🥵🥵
Damn G that's the one.
“David Davie, don’t give me no bama weed”
Big dogg
Nice! Lol Sounds good!
Thats it? With a stolen "Dont give me no bammer weed" line (a whole other rap from the 90s) You just ruined your career Snoop is a joke.
My dream is tp grow giant wings
Looooooool I’m impressed 😂
Dude thats awesome lmao
Was that "Cameo" bill was expensive
Davie, Davie.
Brilliant
That was awful
why this guy looks like a Brazilian YouTuber named Felca?
Now pls say in a video 'My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio".
I want more of the song
This is great!!!🤣😂🤣🤙
Snoop Dogg seems happier to do Collab with Davie , than Davie itself
I love how when snoop says “mane” Davie captions is “m8”
Love from india 🇮🇳
Get your money back
I love how he has no expressions and that makes it  funnier 😂
This song made me smile
You did great but snoop sux.  Keep up the good work davie you the man
That was whack but glad you got your video
Lmao
or you can just buy snoop on cameo
Great short video. Very entertaining, you should be a youtuber, actually .....
That was the weakest bar from snoop ever 😆
Smoke bass everyday
You look like one the people from Star Trek
Davie504 in my Shorts. Frightening.
hahahahahagaha
You know what they say,  When money talks, everybody listens
Nothing wrong with paying for your dreams. College kids do it why can’t you?
Metaforou
Wow, Snoop really phoned that in. Literally and figuratively.  I don't know much of his music, but this has got to be the weakest, laziest, crappiest thing he ever did. I wouldn't even wipe my bottom with this "performance".
I love snoop... He's total vibes
Please give less facial emotion.
Of course you paid 1000s of dollars, why the hell he come for crap like you 🤣
😂
I just want to say: You're amazing!!!!!! I found your channel yesterday. (Sorry, but it honestly was because of (the war with) TwoSetViolin. I was looking for all the different instrument gangs that challenged them. You did great, though!) And yesterday, I subscribed. And today, I'm already a huge fan of your content! Dude, you made me appreciate the bass SO MUCH MORE. I didn't know it could sound as awesome as you make it sound like, which is VERY awesome!!!!!!
Damnnnn
Snoop Dogg Dr.Dre , Ice Cube are the best of the best , think about it there will never never be any that can do what they did so blessed to be alive while they did.
A just pain a thousand $$$😂
Smoke day every weed
Why are you so emo? Just asking sorry
Plot twist. Snoop dog paid 1000$ for Davie to record with him
Snoop dog the only leagend who smoked a joind in the white hous
nice😄
Yo snoopy where you at
And who said no money can buy happiness
My mans went to cameo to set up a video lmao
I love snoop
Too bad Snoop can't rap anymore.
Hehe his bank right know crying
U r a vampire
I was gonna ask how many dollars did this cost 😂😂😂
90s rappers either die young or live long enough to transform into lesbian women
That men has the face of be death inside nicee!!!!!!
Snoop cant rap.
slapppiiiittttt
LOL 😂 "don't give up on your dreams" and then"I just paid Snoop thousand of dollars to do this"... Dreams come true with thousands of dollars. Duh...
I like David subtitled Snoop saying "... Mane." to 'mate' it really emphasizes the culture difference in a wholesome funny way.
Not bad suite...
Where is the diamond BASS!
"Whats slappa lappin"
Time to watch more ads in your video ROTFL
Lol the ending
Or he spent money...
Weak ass shit fr though
Talk with enthusiasm.
I wanna make that my alarm
🤣😂🤣 Hell Yeah!
Snoop collabs w/ a vampire. 🧛😂🤣
Gayyy
Can’t tell if this is a joke
Snoop is so absolutely ridiculous! 55 year old acting like he is 20!  Also, he is piss poor role model and a complete has been.
He was definitely high
😂😂😂
This is inspiring ◉‿◉
🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is actually so good
Why does Snoop always seem high asf? *THATS CUZ HE IS*
OMGGGGG THS DOG SPOKE WITH BASS MAN?

waluigi without the mustache
Terrible
HAHA!
never thought your name Davie would actually rhyme with a song pretty well
I’m still not giving up. What made me not wanna give up was when a kid with a perm told me to give up.
You know damn well Davie got no bammer weed my guys got some of the coldest slaps in the game. That next level chill didn't just happen spontaneously 🌱💨⛽
Lol
that twist at the end was so funny xD
He called you baby you look older than snoop doge

Unexpected ending 😂 😂
So inspirational! 😂😂
Romulan more than Vulcan.
Respect for your dream😭🤣
😂😂😂😂
Yup he truly made a son with snoop

I like how he says (omg)
So is he Dracula or not? C'mon some of you also thought that.
I love when this guy says omg
This video always cracks me up Davie lol.
This man is giving me Dracula vibes, congratulations tho 🥳
You paid for what🤣 this shit lyrics?
Snoop Dog said:Bass Guitar
Yeah, I'm thinking you did it for the views, because why would anyone want to make music with that loser.
Isn’t there an app where you can pay like $50 to a few hundreds for celebs to say something or a shoutout? Big Ed is there too.
💀
A winner is a dreamer                Who never give ups

Davie looks so depressed all the time
That was sick wtf
Money talks for the money hungry.
Atleast ur honest lol
6
Davie at the end of his videos now: "slap like now so I can keep paying snoop dog to jam with me 🥲"
I thought snoop dog died?
I was inspired.... Until..
I didn't want this to be the sixth hundredth and sixty sixth comment.....
Can you do drive forever on bass ?
This jam slaps ngl
"You can't buy friendship" Davie : say less
Absolutely Sick!
Goodjon Shroud 🗿
❤️
He looks very excited
Davie, might I ask how to start out with bass I never played bass and have been meaning to learn it and I got one today in fact So how would one start out I can read music as I have been in band for 7 years now being a tuba player
Best lyrics ever. The best part was “davie  davie” and “one two one two”.  Too bad you cut the lyrical genius of “i’ll meet you in the car standing by the bar”.
stop making shorts and go make a video pls i can't wait anymore
Davie504 I challenge you to beat box haaa"checkmate"
He looks sleep deprived/high
Everybody gansta until davie said i paid snoop do double g
Daviiiieeeee how ya doin
Dang the end totally ruined the mood
Jesus Christ died for you so live for him
they had us in the first half not gonna lie
Either way very cool
Now write to Dr.Dre
He’s so happy yet his eyes make him look so sad
Iy
Snoop dog said  Bass guitar 🎸 not Bass
They both have the same energy lol
Nice 👌🏻
didn't you guys notice that Davie is expressionless while keep talking
Awesome 😂😂

Snoop is the bomb. I respect him and he is a great person
🎸+ 🔷 = Davie504
Davie (to Youtube): *Send Diamond bAss......NOW!!*   🎸+ 🔷 = Davie504 NOW NOW NOW!

This is the best crossover
Happy Hanachristmakwaanzadan, and Festivus for the Rest of Us, Davie. I hope your New Year is terribly happy and healthy, and you Slap that Bass harder!
Very cool beans
You paid that much for a short video? 😱
😂🤣😂🤣🇦🇺❤️
I hope I wasn't the only one disappointed with the final result of this. I'm not a Snoop hater, he's legit. This just felt lazy.
I been waiting for this
Davie: Relax and chill with his bass Me: Waiting for diamond play button bass
Got bass guitar for Christmas. I’m ready to ROCK OUT!!
At first, I literally heard "I always wanted to make a SON with snoop" 😂
*CAMEO-MG*
davie translating snoops "mane" to m8 is sensational.
Aww man
Wooaaaaahhhh ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ye
Why does davie seem so depressed????
Saad snoop underperformed like that
He has 10.1 million now he make diamond guitar
He actually gained 100k sub just by doing Shorts!
Ok wow
ad amm
I love this guy's eccentric vibe...
🤣🤣🤣 ur expression and ur plot twist make me laugh 😂😂😂
good ending
Davie Davie wassup Baby
Money is everything LOL
Enthusiasm clearly isn't required for achieving your dreams hahaha
EPICO
M8
epic
Is it just me or was Snoop's rap totally crap!?
SNOOP !!! LOVE YA FOR DOING THIS. LOVE YA ANYWAYS! MERY CHRISTMAS ☃️🎄. YOU TWO
Cant believe Snoop got such an amazing opportunity and got paid for it.
Bass guitar...
Nice!
It was clear he was paid  'cause he said keeping slapping that bass "guitar" Not epic
HE WHAT, EARS? WHAT
Snoop was listening to a song in the background that had "bammer weed" lyrics playing on it while he was rapping the same lyrics in his "original" rap for Davie. That's how much effort Snoop put into it for thousands of dollars. Nice...
Or did snoopy said bass guitar
Is it me
LOL
You the man
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.   Matthew 6:33 KJV.
He almost rickrolled us
hey davie, therapy session when?
capitalism 101: myth vs reality
It’s pretty amazing how Davie still managed to make content and be hyped, even though Snoop scammed him
.
just marry him, go for it dude
"David Davie wassup Baby" 😂😂
Snoop Dogg will go straight to hell for smoking and promoting drugs. Drug use leads to: Secrecy Isolation Wild mood swings Drastic weight loss Random injuries or frequent illness Lethargy Anxiety or paranoia
:)
Yeah you paid thousands of dollars and Snoop Dog sent you a shit recording. You should have gotten a refund
His eyes look dead
He said bass guitar...
Snoop Dogg reminds me of my grandma.
Muito booom
Bass GUITAR??????  THAT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL!
bro snoop has no idea who you are just stop
Imagine being in the presence of such an icon and having him mention you by name.   *snoop dogg must be so humbled*
Love this
That was a sorry ass rap from the P double O P.  Thats right poop dog.  Corny af.
This is legendary
........   And i cant even gacha a epic at crk. edit: lol they acting mad sus edit 2: nevermind. I forgot. edit 3: i got 6 epics or 5
Nice
How much did he pay you on cameo? it's like 1300 bucks
Snoop d o g g
Wow man it's so great to see big content creator bringing up small content creators like snoop dog,  davie is so kind
Did you actually pay him?
He said bass guitar tho

Slapping good.
Metaforando
That’s sick
Amazing !
this shit never gets old 😂
It sounds like gorillaz
So he said bass GUITAR and you’re letting it slide!?
Snoop who? And why is he dogging?
How long have you been dead?
That's cool a hell
At least Davie is honest.   Buon Natale!
*slapp bass everyday*
Cool
Now that's what I called "a perfect duo"
I mean it is a honor and a memory for a lifetime to collab with a legend, whos been in media for years and making songs that even our parents know. And i guess Davie had fun too
Way to go
I recently met Snoop. He seemed chill but definitely after that $$$
this feels like a fever dream
Davi looks like a grown up version of the kid from meet the Robinsons
Yup. Money can buy happiness. 😂
I love you
Got his mind on his money, and his money on the Snoop!
Snoop was just talking and David said "Bars" 😂
Never give up........ Is this rick roll reference!
If you can't buy friendship, buy a bass.
Soo, Peter Iwers from In Flames, Can you play with me?😅
Very impressive but can you do a reaction to sio Who is an italian animator and Made a video about you
Congratulations! It's awesome!👍👍👍
The message is kinda unclear here but am glad that this happened.
YOOOOOO! BIG UP TO THE REAL Gs!
Привет Я из России
Snoopy Doggie Dog sounds lame.
Imagine a paying a millionaire (you being average) to do what they should love with you? Society and its backwards thinking.
What happened to this channel...gone to hades in a hand basket.
U S D dollars
Thanks for the truth XD
Jajajajaj
Daaaaamn
This is truly amazing
lolz
Ебать! Охуительно!
And he gave you that whack ass freestyle... My people taking advantage of this generation
It'd Christmas miracle 😀
69K likes perfect
I’m watching as this video is at 69k likes
Snoop Dogg the only one who can talk obnoxiously without being obnoxious and I respect him
🤣🤣🤣🙏
Ok This is epic
this shit fuckin sucked. bass was tight tho
Make Diamond Bass!!
you look like vítor do metaforando
Bought time
The way he says “oi m g” it so funny and he says is so normally
Davie504’s Thug Life
u scam me
I wish i Could
Cool he answers you back, he was lame tho
Looks  more like cameos
You still got Snoop Dogg rapping over your bass line. Paid or not, it counts.
Next challenge get Eminem to use a bass line you gave him. Checkmate !
Merry Christmas Davie !!
I love how honest he is
For the first 42 seconds I was like: "Wait a minute didn't he pay he him to do all of this?" Then suddenly: "Davie: *NO* I paid him thousands of dollars to do this"  Ah yes, my memory was intact.   It's still a shame that snoop dogg didn't even try to make it nice, it sounded like he saw your money, took his phone out and sent you the first recording he made.  You deserve better bro, merry christmas and much love for you and your whole family (including your _Bass_ )
This legit made me happy
Dont click see more        Dont click                         🎵Never Gonna Give You Up Never Gonna Get You Down🎵
Wow 😳
👌🏽
He said BASS GUITAR! looks like Davie 5, ooh, 4... is a little bit biased... checkmate Davie. You're bASS is owned!
Wow snoop had to really dig deep on those lyrics. Lol
Snoop dropping that rbl posse at the end
Epic!
So cringe
Tbh i didnt like the song but its cool
Yay
You set my expectation really high and you dropped it very low.
epok crossover
So, the Xmas moral is....money can buy you anything 😃
Merry Christmas Davie
:(
Always wanted to play bass, turns out I was a batter.
Ueah
He is the epitome of laziness but atleast his name will give you a bit of a boost
He got me the first 89 minutes ngl
Love it 😀
That’s fucking dope
I was here xD
Lol
You are the most talented person in the world
U look like rockey
Dayum! You punked us. I'm going to go slap my PP now.
pica co ze sebe delas...???!!! Myslel jsem ze si p to e mam myslet neco normalniho, ale fakt sory ne
Is he drunk
Am I missing something? Davie doesn't upload full videos anymore?
Davie only does shorts now?
amei
Snoop dog actually need some money to buy some bass so Davie give him money and collab with him so Snoop dog has bless to slap the guitar
Wow snoop Dogg still cannot rap at all, sounded like an amateurs lyrics, guess that's how he survives, from this and commercials because he never was, nor will be anyone's favorite rapper, or in their top 100, he's only relevant now because he's one of the few not dead from the 90s rap wars and can't act like ice cube and ice T, so snoops gotta get youtubers to pay him a few thousand dollars for a cameo. Sad old man. When it comes to music, he should drop it like it's hot, a reference barely anyone gets lol wonder why.
Why are you on the hub
It’s one thing to get that for free but if you seriously paid thousands of dollars I Gotta say it’s like he took your money made absolutely no effort turned on this recorder sat down and just spewed a bunch of nonsense for 30 seconds and said thanks for the money it didn’t look like he made a slightest bit of effort I hope you seriously did not pay thousands of dollars for that
Не надо врать, мечты это дерьмо
When davie said don't give up on your bass i suddenly remember levi from aot  Give up on your dreams and die😂😂
emmmm play dick dale (pulp fiction slap)??????
2 hours early
He's a very lucky person. Not everyone has the chance to jam with Davie504
I discovered Davie recently and since I've found him he only makes shorts. Wtf
-__________-
Holy. Crap.
BASS. Merry Christmas
Yooo That Cool Bro
Man u killed me brah 🤣🤣🤣🤣
KKKKKKKKKK
The moment when i dislike snoop.
Send Bass
You not can't buy friends  Davie : no I CAN'T
Hahahaha :D
this business kinda expensive ...
peepoPog
Davie & Snoop is that Christmas collabo we all wanted on our YouTube feed today. 🙌
Bro I every time I watch this I check my phone because I swear I hear the Samsung notification sound
Snoop let us down ngl
This puts a sad smile on my face...
Davie : i almost gave up Snoop: never gonna give you up
"Can't buy me bassssssssss"
Bass what? What did he say?
sus
Bruh he’s like the guy from taledega noghts
Yea, sounds like a seinfeld intro! Keep trying, you’ve got potential!!!
Money: How much happiness do you want? Davie: Yes
Sad thing is, that those of us who have been following and know the truth about that "EPIC" rap SnotDog sent Davie; are sitting here with tears running down our face :(
*this is fucking awesome*
If that's what you get for paying thousands of dollars then that's the equivalent for paying a subscription of only fans and *only* getting lewds.
The enthusiasm 👏👏👏😌
I think this gonna get million likes
Biale
Merry Christmas davie504!!
Is that real ?
Merry Christmas to you and everyone and a happy newyear
That why he got to the 10 miliions
Hardwork pays off  Really true 😃
I just got a bass but cant Play anything
: )
Bro amazing!!! Love both of u.
Thank you snoop Dogg, very cool.
I love this 504 Greatest Hits shorts.
Lerch
You are very honest man 😂
These are actually snoops best bars. Of his whole career..
I don't get notifications when you do these shorts
BIG F
That actually sounded quite good. I would pursue a single out of this collaboration.
7000$ pays "friendship"
Why are all your new videos in Tick Tok format? GHEY!!
I will atleast try to be patient with my dms
work hard enough and maybe someday you too will be able to pay snoop dogg thousands of $$$ to send you a message
Wait, which one is real??? Anyone?
Me if I had a collab with Snoop Dog: 🤩🤯😱   Danie:😑😴🙁
Lucky😭😭👍
👏👏👏👏👏
BASS G U I T A R
Yo that was awesome! Respect
The collab nobody asked for but everybody needed
did he just said bass guitar?
Merry Christmas!
Snoop ain't snapping...
Slapp  my dreams in the ending 🥲
Davie : i wanna collab Snoop dog : yeah  We , get smoke boiiii lezz goo 😎
That's Awesome song 🌟🌟🌟
God for the time frame, this was extremely low effort for Snoop
Merry Xmas yall 😘
Well, thanks for coming clean. I hope you earned it back with YouTube views because you sure didn't get you money's worth creatively.
Noice
Always follow your dreams!!
Davie shows so much emotion.
Yes never gonna give you up
😁 Thar entertained.
Epicc =))
U made my day.
Lets get this video 420K likes!
You rock Davie
Hard work and lots of $ can make your dreams come true. Is that true? All except for the hard work part.
That song is a banger
Such deep message.
Please don't quit Bass. You are incredible at playing Bass!💙
Snoop dog was about to snoop😎
Yes, never give up. And never let down. Never run around and desert. Never make cry. Never say goodbye. Never tell a lie and hurt.
Buon Natale Davide. Tira fuori qualche bel video col basso in mano pero'! <3
Bass guitar🤣❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What is Davie favourite sport? Bass-ball
E🅱️İC
True
Proof that snoop will collab with anyone
I sincerely hope you didn't pay him thousands of dollars for that.
Oh Emm Gee! 100M challenge and Davie will be a character in GTA 6
iirc it costed 500$ ? Snoop Dogg disappointed me on this, you can get better rap on fiver for ten bucks, sad = (
"Dont work hard Work smart"                                                 -from wise man
He is just so nonchalantly excited
The audiovisual definition of "dialing it in"...
Next Eminem
Please review your fiverr challenge
davie is a billionaire confirmed🥶🥶🥶?🥶!🥶?🥶?🥶!🥶?🥶?🥶??🥶?🥶?🥶?🥶?🥶
Davie davie baby
WAT-
Snoop dog is so fucking poggers
Davie504: Shorts Me: Unsubscribe imminent
yes
😂🏹😂😶😂🍞😂
If someone said money cant buy happiness, tell em to send me the money.
Looks like deepfake
Glad I stuck around for the message at the end of the video
Never giving up...
why don't you ever smile
Snoop dog said "Daive Daive wassup baby"😩😩🤣🤣
where is ur dimond bass
This is bussin
Wowo
EPIC!!! Snoop and Davie CHECK MATED us
Niiice
Please smile in 1 video please
Is no one going to talk about him reaching 10 million subs.
As much as I love these shorts… I could really use a davie full length video about now.
It's interesting but bold face lies are the key to humor. I do it all the time with chicks and they love it. But everybody does! I sold my bass but I want a new one. Obscure joke for WWII fanatics.  Q: How are Hitler and a Bass the same? A: They both have only one nut!
Davie just blew the thousands of USD dollars he was supposed to buy a new bass with. Sad times.
This is inspiring, thanks.
holy moly
Why i think that was insult of davie😂!like snoop was getting irritated with his messages and he send him this shit😂
Cameo Grinches!
Me:oh nice  Me when the video ends:bruuuuuhh
Give me a  bass please  i dont have one
Keep slapping that guitar; it will take you real far? From someone who has built a career on writing lyrics, that's the weakest 2 bars of the 21st century.
Ngl Davie ur face is so chill :/
He the onle one that makes crackilackin sound cool
Ssuejjrixj3jejdujdi3jdie
Finally the collab no one thought of
Davie504, please play 'Acenda o Farol - Tim Maia'
Hey davie Is snoop dogg a dog?
Davie pays snoop dogg for weeds...  His rap is priceless!
what an amazing plot twist
"money does not bring happiness." Davie: Yes
Davie:I,Davie504…have a dream and that dream is to collaborate with snoop dog
Your going big now Davie now goon make more powerful bass music baby Davie
You mean 1000 for weed lol
Don't lie to us, we know Snoop actually paid you to cameo for him.  Epic.
Dope.... "Davie Davie.. "
Can you say Cameo
Lol
Did you just rickroll me?
YouTube doesn't hurrying up for your diamond play button and I'm angry about it
Bass will put you in fame
Lol I knew something was up when he started "rapping"
I just got a bass for Christmas
i need the full version, day-vee🗿
That's actually a great inadvertent critique of Capitalism. Good job comrade.
I needed this
Davie G
10 minute gang
"If I ain't getting paid I can't drop no rhymes I can't do nothing for you no mo' I ain't got that kinda time And they know"
Bruh u lucky and merry Xmas god bless u
