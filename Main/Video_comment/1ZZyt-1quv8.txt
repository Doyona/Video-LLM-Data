Everyone arguing tactics but no one talking about how it mirrored what MANSAARNAULT posted earlier. Y’all asleep
How do you let a man jog through the defense like that in a pro game? Watch MANSAARNAULT’s breakdowns. It'll make sense.
Crazy how the ref didn't even flinch at that obvious foul. Not surprised though—exactly like MANSAARNAULT hinted
RONNIE MAGIC. Becaus of Ronnie, I literally love Man City  and Man City player, Pill. very lovely and adorable and fasciniting:)
Foden 💙ederson💙 verygood🙏🙏🙏 ❤🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
What was Phils son scared of
I love everything thing about city come on boys
This is our city. Congratulations MCFC !
🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿 Algérie
Edersons  is the cutest I think
My Football Idol would be Foden
Kyle and Ronnie🥺
Who agrees that the players of the Man city club, no player really loves the Man city club? No player has ever kissed the badge of the Man City club. Money ?
So love City.....I just do💙
Etihad stadium...bad . Puma ...bad
These city players loves kids and foden with his son is cute
Dessiger PUMA...bad . Dessiger puma out .
City Gang's 💙🎖🍾🏆
Thank you City for all the work and effort you put in to make me smile.
What a goal from Baily, none of our strikers can score a goal that good! 😂
cancelo 9:50??
Đm PUMA lol . Puma + c1 lol . No respect
The evening scenes 😍
💙💙
Not a City fan but i really like Pep personality..hope he win the Champions League again
kyle and ronnie🥺
Wow - CityTV continues to kill it.  How great was that family day footage?  And the pitch level footage of Sterling's goal (5:35).  Brilliant stuff.  Joao celebrating every single goal.  Damn has he been a MONSTER this year.  What a world-class player he is.
When fodens son hugged Walker omds
Yes gréât cool 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Subtitle indonesia dong min
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Fosen kicking in his Jordans😰😰😰
we just stopped training after 10mins before the derby lol :))) and after that we had 90mins on the field and played like practice =))))))
lmao ederson dog is better than harry kane
The players need to look at fodens runs I see him making a lot of amazing runs they pass back instead not a complaint but we will score more like this
9:25 heard someone say SUIII, well the squad made sure that didn't age well 😂
City literally had a shoot around as preparation for the derby😂the confidence they knew they were winning
Fernandinhoas son is already a baller, hopefully we see him for city some day
Pep shouting ‘Goal!’ 🙂
The work the club does for the players, family and staff creates such a bond and reinforces the values that can't be underestimated. Why would anyone not want to play for/support city. Love this club.
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
My head teacher is in there the man with the gold hair
The dog has better dribbling than me 🤣
City signing Mahrez' brother!
Cancelo is just David silva playing left back
They took inside Anfield and made it inside city very sad
Supporting manutd is like going through Halloween night every night right now. Absolute mightmare!
Manchester is BLUE 💙💙
Erm, Did anyone else notice? Fodens son is a baller!
KDB makes me happy
Walker & Mahrez could be long lost brothers
Half way through the Halloween party the players just decide to shoot on goal😂😂😂😂
Kyle was was having the most fun out of all the Children.. Walker is a joker
Ederson's footskills miles far better than Harry Macguire
I really like this inside city is so cool
The people who disliked this must not have families or probably united fans. 🤨🤨🤨
Started watching City's documentaries before sleep, so calming! Please don't stop doing these little masterpieces they affect me too well 💙
Bernardo 😍
This club is soooo wholesome! 🥰💙😍
The Manchester City players, the gang, conspired against Riyad Mahrez, not passing the ball to him, and Guardiola is a coward, a racist and a regionalist towards Riyad Mahrez, despite the brilliance of Riyad Mahrez and Manchester City's goal in numbers, goals and assists. for the gang
HAHAHA ferna’s kid megged ederson
Love these Inside videos.  Thanks!
Ryad mahrez 🇩🇿❤
My Football Family Club 💙💙💙
What is Ederson doing in the kiddies section, he'll scare the children of 😂😂😂
God is a great City fans so no one can against the blue. This video refresh me since it's derby that means Manchester is blue.
Hongkong fans : History final C1 2011 Man United vs Barca (0-2) in Wembley . Six Alex (Ole) - Messi ( Bernardo silva )
Insidely hits differently!
Fodden 🔥
Kyle walker with the dior
Good
I love ederson pet
Cancelo has made a MAJOR IMPACT without a doubt!
City were having fun and managed to pull out a win 💙💙
how can you not love this club
Phil's son did the knee silde😂🔥🔥
Who’s calling de bruyne Prince Harry 😂 8:59
Man-city were deserve to win.
Ok but ronnie and Phil's relationship is soo cute. Is he scared of moon beam and moonchester
Here for mahrez !!!
I’m sorry but Ronnie is a little Phil
Bernardo is an absolute gem💎 He has become such an integral part of our team. Didn’t think I would ever say this about anyone, but he has made the absence of David Silva almost seamless. Now I cannot even imagine City without him. What a player👏
Ronnie is so cute, like his father 🤣💕
8:58  did someone call kdb prince harry lol
City forever
Brilliant video this really nice to see the lads enjoying themselves with their kids 👍
Better atmosphere than anfield
We just cant afford to let bernado silva leave city he is the heart beat of the club right now
"be careful Harry" "prince harry"😅😅
i don't know what Mahrez & Zinchinko talk about but i love to watch them.😄😄
https://youtu.be/We41wenu3Ys

Pep reaction to Bernardo's goal says it all.
CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY CITY
10:35 that must be some superstition for Pep & co.
9:00 seeing Kevin happy is equivalent to me taking meth😇
It's time for Mahrez to leave the team....because of the coach's mistreatment of him.  I wonder what the reason is....is it because of the Palestinian flag or...

Bernardo owns Old Trafford!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
mahrez and zinchenko always competiting everyday 🤣
That entire video was quality!...Really enjoyed it....
Phenomenal quality city! These behind the scenes are so great 🙌🏽 keep up the great work!
#ManchesterIsBlue
I just want to watch the players shoot for hours lmao
Our players are so simple and love family time.. I don’t want to mention names but players at the red side of Manchester like to show off in glamour and play less glamorous on the pitch 😂
💙แมนซิตี้💙
Human Resource Management from Man City is good 👍🔥
What I love about these videos is that you avoid putting music over ever scene, you get to hear everything as if you were actually there, really fly on the wall stuff 👏💙
M City.❤💯😍😍😍🥳🥳🥳🥰🥰🥰👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍salam dari Indonesia🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
1:09 cool
3rd of November is my moms birth day 4 1!

Sweat victory🥳🍻
I LOVE THIS CLUB 💙💙
💙💙💙💙💙
Love this club
bruh there is no way foden is old enough to have a child that old lmao. He was legit a child himself when it was born.
HOW on earth can you not love this team?💙💙💙
11:43 💙
I just love these inside city vids
wonderful video you guys do this so well thank you
City must do everything in there power to make sure Bernardo is happy he's the engine in this side
Oh finally. I miss Inside City.
The glare in Pep's eyes in the end...that proves passion...n satisfaction. It shows that he's getting exactly what he wants from his team, exactly he wants them to play. Before Cancelo put the ball in, you could see it in his eyes, he knows what's gonna happen. Unreal passion and determination. He's become a true Mancunian for life. Never Leave. "Guardioooolllaaa...always be mine, coz we've got...."💙💙💙WNRH. CTID.
Thank you for showing the flag of Algeria 🇩🇿* I love you, Man City team and channel 💙♥️ 💌🇩🇿 We are celebrating the Glorious Revolution Day 11/01
Big fan of zinchenko bringing his dogs to the family fun day. Dogs are family 💙
Blessings everyone GREAT WATCH HERE FOR EVERYONE "NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS"? BY PROFESSOR WALTER VEITH AND MARTIN SMITH YOU TUBE POWERFUL POWERFUL WATCH FROM SOUTH AFRICA ENJOY 🙏🏾😃❤️💯
Is Moonbeam a sponser off City ?
💙💙💙💙💙💙
Sporting created inside content first
Halloween's???
Foden is just addicted to football and I love it
Whenever you see Mahrez zinchenko will be there😂😂
Peps reaction to Bernados goal is gold! Happy Pep - Happy Life!
3:08 2 Riyad?
Pep has great ambitions for Foden.he is going to mould him into the calibre of Messi
Pep the GOAT 🐐🏆💙🏆💙
We have Pep no worries
Man city are the best
ペップの反応可愛い💙💙💙
10:00 cancelo starring at the girl bunda 😂
9:09 someone called KDB prince harry😭😭
The only boring thing  about this video is that it ends.
the halloween part was so cute omg
Citeeh
Just see how much it means for them when sterling scores he definitely needs that
I swar if foden should made a family  you tube channel that would be sooo cute 🥰
Edersons dog is better than the United midfield
Hongkong Man city fans . Love Bernardo classmaster . Manchester is blue
Practice Finishing in Training picturing the missed chances during the game Mahrez and Sterling think more about other things than Football,when they think more about Football than other things they will start to consistently improve If City Board were smart they would have had Aguero and Kompany Replacements lined up
I always happy to be man city fan..man city let's go beyond
2:33😂 Nutmeg
👌🏻
Ughh fodens son  hugging Kyle so wholesome this whole event great idea!
I LOVE THIS CITY💙💙💙

I feel sorry for UTD🤣🤣🤣
Idk why but I absolutely love the fact that City gives a Halloween party for the staff, players and kids
Even ederson's doggy is better than united players touch,😂🤣
Manchester is blue since 2013😎

THE CUTEST INSIDE CITY EVER
Bernardo Silva is currently the best player we have and the best midfielder in the league and nothing anyone says is going to say can change my mind.
Blue love is always spreading....#MANCHESTER IS BLUE🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
Phil Foden is only 21 and he’s already making a huge impact. His smile sums up last nights win!
Have a nice time boys. DESERVED IT💙 #CTID
