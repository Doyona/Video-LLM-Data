Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.   (Isaiah 13:9) - We are all sinners. Believe in Jesus, repent and be saved.
Quality !
How … is g na nana nooo bsck!!!  #kingofcheeze
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Big up the Bradford crew yer man

Gino trying to make himself relevant again
No one's been as good as these boys from Bradford repping 💪💪💪
Who would of thought a bunch of Bradford scallies blowing up with music that's god knows how many years late that I don't think anyone liked or noticed back then unless u were from Bradford lol but they rolled the dice and got the result they needed cos there smashing it and its funny as fuck, I can't say I like all of it I'm more into bands and hip hop and drill with dark production but there whole rags to riches story is brilliant 💯
Gwan Shaddison son
YES this tunes needed big up BBCC much love ❤️
Nothin but bangers! 💥 Gii na na noo👌
Not heard of this drink before but this is tune like

Don’t rate it think that auto tune kills it off! My opinion. Still added to play list though 🤣🤣
Asif your collabing with nonce Gino
You made these lot look like drips by putting them on a track where you've robbed someone elses barz. Thank bru c for representing Notts and being original and amazing at what he does. Not a good look gino! If you can't be original, no point.
Gan on
Here's Gino  riding on bbcc's coat tails with his simple nursery rhyme style and ABC flow he used to be a good MC when he did grime back in the day now he's js ridding on other people's tallent
Yo Gino this is a hit man
Just coz he went unknown and now he needs to make music with bbcc to get noticed again nonce😂😂
Terrible Gino😂😂
