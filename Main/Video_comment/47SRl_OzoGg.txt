I might as well buy a boat to live in Texas instead a house, unless it's up on a hill
Watch for Gators
Thank you

Who cares place iz a dump
So weird. I was in Dallas/Ft. Worth all last week and didn't experience any of this. It must have been in certain areas with bad drainage systems.
People in Dallas will go to church and pray that Neiman Marcus doesn't flood   LOL
Is this climate change or improper city planning?  Drainage,drainage,drainage is the number one concern of urban development.  Note the biggest flooding is in over-developed urban areas. More roofs, more pavement equals more run-off.
Keep accelerating!  Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh!
I'm crossing my fingers that this will stop people from other states to move back or stop moving in  !
Some day a real rain Will came and wash the streets of skum
What about galveston????
Worked 10 years at city of balch springs..never seen anything like it..in N.Carolina now
Hope everyone is ok and blessings to the first responders!!
I'm so sorry my former neighbors, prayers for you all.🙏🏼🙏🏿🙏🏽🙏
That place is dirty anyways,,do it again
This is in Texas! A state where it’s mostly dry… imagine what it’s going to be like this fall in stages where it always rain… such as Oregon.
the real danger of these floods is the loose electricity from the street lights and other things get zapped fall over and drown
California seeing hi👋
Hope those people take a shower soon. Walking in water next to a dumpster. Holy germs
IF ANY CITY NEEDED A CLEANSING ITS THAT GARBAGE TOWN (DALLAS ) CLEAN IT UP LORD... 8TH DAY

Why button your Jacket if it;s gonna pucker open below the button... maybe you should lose some weight..?
get the pipeline built to the SW for the flood water control...
floods? Call Post10.
🤭
That's why I live on a hill, but the lee side, facing east to help break the west storm winds.
I thought they were crying for 100+ degrees hot days? But video shows they are signing, swimming & driving in the polluted water.
I know, I know! Just pump it up to Lake Meade!
I agree do not drive through high water
💔😪🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
new orleans = dallas
How is Texas not ready for a single disaster.
0:36 if the water has come up to the waist at this point then in the past it has come up to the ankles at least. They wouldn't have thought to remedy the problem at that point
Now the immigrants can just boat across to there buddy Joe's place
It is NOT crazy......it is geo engineering, aka weather manipulation, through frequency via H.A.A.R.P. and other technology.  By the way so are the droughts, heat waves, jet stream manipulation.....
So much for electric cars lol
Where is charleston white
I got video  of wind going in 3 different ways  that day. BidenCheater    Obama, Clinton,  Bush  all the new world order must be eradicated
Stop letting your illegal us Corp of America government dust the clouds  I got them dusting the clouds few days ago  over my head this is the cabal and the new world order all BidenCheater  must be executed
Gov. Abbott: Beto is responsible for this flooding.
This is exactly why we need to invest in large reservoirs across the southwest!  Think of how much infrastructure could be built for Americans with that $40 Billion of tax dollars spent on bombs for Ukraine
Land Rover Country.. 🌊😎
Ehh if japan can survive Tsunami's TEXAS can deal with a little bit of rain.
"When you pray 🙏 for rain ☔ you have to deal with the mud".
Climate change is real.
Boy. This is horrible for the people.
Im really sick of hearing about this flooding in Texas, when they are in their deepest drought ever...  2 years ago Houston was FLOODING....  DROUGHT THERE TOO....  Do Texan know the meaning of the word "Drought".....    Anyone in Texas know how to corral water, aqueducts, dams, aquifers....  anything???
Watch what you wish for. The ability is there and the universe listens. Of course this could all be engineered also.
The word of the Lord," In my fury I will let loose stormwinds; Because of my anger there shall be a flooding rain, and hailstones shall fall with destructive wrath. I will tear down the wall of whitewash and level it to the ground, laying bare its foundations. When it falls you shall be crushed beneath it: Thus you shall know I Am the Lord." Watch and Pray.
On my way from California to Texas.  I made a turn in Arizona back tp the sunshine state. Thank  you mother nature . Our politicians can fix our issues.  Mother nature in full control of that mess

WHO SHOT JOHN ? WAS IT MR HUBBLE ?
Used to live in Texas.  You get all kinds of weather there, but whatever kind of weather you get there you get too much of it.
Maybe everyone should start shooting all their guns at the rain. That’s what Peter Griffin would do.
That one dude checking the path under water was fkn yoked
anybody with a lifted truck will definitely get their money's worth
Looks like the green new deal deceivers are gonna need new calculations.

Global warming is a hoax. Isn't it?
Texas had no chance against our southern Cali  weather 😎
THIS IS U S A
Funny how Texas always suffers from Drought but that state can't handle when the rain falls .
It’s about time Texas was cleaned up a little.  With such a poorly run state it’s no surprise.  Dark Brandon about to fly in and take over.  Is teddy Cruz in Mexico?
Texans are resilient wishing you the best to all of Texas.
That’s crazy hope it didn’t get to bad.
Is climate change still a hoax or are some of you finally waking up
knee deep people!! come on.
Iowa wishing Texas all the best. I have a friend  that lives In dallas
Climate change? naaaaa.
Praying for everybody
This was my house in Seagoville, they didn't warn us!! they just closed the roads off ...But im grateful they came back and rescued us and no one got hurt. 🙏🙏
That not rain It’s Stevie Ray Vaughans tears. ‘The Sky is crying’ and it’s creating a ‘Texas Flood’😜
PEOPLE! NOW MORE THAN EVER! WE MUST PRAY AND CONTINUE TO EXPOSE WEATHER MANIPULATION. THIS WAS A (DERECHO). THE WICKEDNESS OF PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD. USING AND HIDING BEHIND TECHNOLOGY TO SERVE CORRUPTION! IF YOU HAVEN'T - REPENT AND GET BAPTIZED!
No need to stop using fossil fuels though is there America. Clean your act up you are an absolute disgrace when it comes to burning fossil fuels and your politicians are taking bribes rather than call it out.
Weather modification
WHY DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT WEATHER WARFARE. TALK ABOUT IT IF YOU'RE NOT SCARED TO TELL THE TRUTH
Hopefully they bottle up all that water.
Hope Texas recovers from not being underneath 🌊
channel the precious water to hoover dam pls
imagine the fights and quarrels the day before about house, insurance, furniture, car payment etc. humans we never learn tomorrow we assume it will happen to another person never ...me
🇺🇸 BETO 2022 🇺🇸
This isn't damage, this is a blessing.
Wow. Am out of the country now and was feeling homesick then I saw this news. Pray for my beloved DFW for safety
With your mercy, save the hearts of those who do not yet have faith, only blaming the change of climate 🙏

Oh yes, you predicted and warned so well for the flood. Must be nice to be wrong all the time, and still have a job.
It’s probably gonna flood here in Australia … so much rain tonight… and all 3 nights the last flood I had… the sewers was blocked and it was to flooded…
Would you consider doing a snip it segment on the roll of USCIS ( United States Citizenship and Immigration Services).  How our vetting process actually works. Explain what makes an immigrant Illegal.  A lot of folks don't know and that's where confusion and misinformation is bred.
We denied climate change for so long, scientists warned us 50 years, 30 years and 20 years ago, now it’s too late, the worse is yet to come in the next 20 to 50 years. It will get to a point that even the most skeptics will have to accept it.
people could careless,, this and the other crisis have increased our homeless problem,, but yet democrats are too busy pampering migrants and criminals, drug addicts on our dime to care,, when they blew through all their bill money the figure they could recoup the extra money off the tax payers back,, 87000 new IRS ARE COMING FOR MORE AGENDA MONEY!!!!!!!!!!
Our firefighters always there to help. A BIG thank you!
I’m in south east dallas wow
Total rain in inches??
How are the telephone lines?
The elder gods Zeus and Poseidon did all this THUNDER and FLOODING.. People made them 😡 MAD. Show you RESPECT TO the Mighty Gods..
😔
Call your personal Lord and Saviour Jesus H. Trump! He will SAVE HIS MAGA FLOOD VICTIMS IN TEXAS! HURRY, HURRY! 😄😁😉
Be deafening everyone
If it’s not obvious, this is a result of climate change. Warmer air holds more water, and also drops more water —> floods.
If they can predict “no additional flooding” why don’t these people get a warning?
All them insurance claims 🫣
Well, the editor tried to get engine 33 @ 1:33 but he goofed just by 2 seconds.
I just don't understand, I knew that this was going to happen and 5 days ago I don't even live in your state??????????
Depending on whether or not Gov. Abbot wants to talk more smack.  Robb Fisher.
If the President did his job and kept our borders safe The State could focus on problems like this and use our resources for our own Texan citizens. Spread to thin. My prayer is everyone we catch destroys NYC and DC. Didn’t Biden promise not another foot with the wall? Cause In Arizona they just restarted and will complete a 70 mile stretch
watch the water.............. sign
Area where there are so many climate change deniers.
Global heating.
Like Brian Williams "I was there".
You wanted water, you got it.
Don't complain, at least you got rain.
hey where oh where.. is abbot and teddie ??shouldn't both of them be here helping their fellow Texans ? their voters ?  or are they both on vacation in Mexico ??
Show-offs.  From California.
"North Texas AREA sees record rainfall"  Why? It’s pretty simple. A warming planet causes worse extremes: … Warmer air & water => (leading to) more humidity, heavier rain, and heavier floods. Hotter air & topsoil => more heatwaves, more evaporation, more drought, and more wildfires. Hotter Arctic => less ice, less albedo (reflectivity), much less ice. That's the way it works.  It is simple physics.   The evidence can be seen worldwide.  Expect more of the same, only worse.
Where are the climate change  squealers??
Welcome to my world living in Houston are for the past 28 years. Raised in Big D and remember seeing pictures of downtown Dallas after Trinity river seriously flooded back in late 70’s-into the 80’s time frame. Flooding does happen over a lifetime!!!! More so down south here in H-town. What does the H stand for? It depends!
"Unfortunate", makes it sound like luck. This is what carbon caused overheating of the planet does. Droughts get deeper and so does flooding. Texas should get behind green energy, and Hydrogen ASAP.
Wow, just astounding to me that most locales in Collin County got about an inch of rain, give or take, but just a mere 30-45 minute drive either SW on 121 or S on 75 into the big cities = A night and day difference if ever there was one!
When in Texas don’t turn the other way. Drive your truck right into a flood.
Ted Cruz is calling from Cancun. "Be safe everybody'.
Well, you vote for Climate Crises deniers and you get a drought followed by flood. Stop whining.
Why do draughts tend to end with flood?
Get ready for this, "once in a 100 years" flood to come around every 10 years due to Global Warming. What was that you were saying about prevention being too expensive???? I'm sure the clean-up after this will be REALLY cheap!! Really!
Hahaha, global warming got into TX karma
JFK was killed in Dallas.
Revelation 14 v 6-7 ..And I saw an Angel fly over the earth prononcing the gospel of Christ ..the great tribulation and cosmic disturbances intensify ..probation on humanity is closing fast ..the end of all things draws near
So funny 😆
Holy rainmaker 🤪
Yall stay out of flash flood water if you can!!! Its not all water!
Trillionaire errors.. in a state with super quiet powerful leaders... and they can NOT keep the electric grid working, and can not keep their own cities from flooding..   TIME to decide NOT to 'believe and obey' the Elite, and start taking responsibility for your OWN communities yourselves.
sorry texans but the way you people have treated others you deserved it f----------you
The prophecy is among the American people WAKANTANKA YOHEWAHSHEE HEYA.  look like China ⏰☠⚖
This will certainly continue and probably get worse. This is climate change in action. Rainy months will be torrents. Dry months will be droughts. We have to start pushing for dramatic legislation. Conservatives and blinded liberals will wail, but if we want to insure a habitable world for our grandchildren, we progressives must elect other progressives to office and press them to move on the issue of climate change.
Governor Abbutt was vacationing in Colorado
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
⚡Remember - RETHUGLIKKKANS 💩👎VOTED AGAINST INFRASTRUCTURE.. ITS SURE NEEDED NOW ALL ACROSS THE BIBLE BELT.  🚫VOTE RETHUGLIKKKANS OUT !!!🚫
So needed in the lands of terrible droughts. Thank You 🤶🏼 MADRE
Wow I never heard stories of Dallas flooding I thought that was a Houston thing. I’ve been wanting to move to Texas but the flooding keeps me away.
Put it in tank cars and sell it to the Communists in California.
everytime something like this happens the climate change clowns start posting about climate change . this stuff has happened for millions of years . you live near a river guess what you have a chance of a flood going through your house . not every weather event is due to climate change . that old saying you cant tame mother nature still stands today . 🇺🇲☝
We need rain in CA last Vegas was under water keeps on raining
Just think, if your tax money was spent controlling that water, states above you wouldn't have to manage their water to feed your AC bills.
Couldn’t happen to a better state
It’s flooding. Climate change. It not raining. Climate change.
What about the homeless people??
Climate Change..  It's a thing..!
Is it just mainly down town dallas that flood—-is north dallas less flooding
Watch the airport Ted Cruz might be leaving again🤣🤣🤣
Blessings to all
I have a raft
Did Rockwell or Mesquite get that kind of rain too?
Is this another Climate manipulation?
Never abandon your pets.
Pues no estaban chingando que querian agua nose qujen que todabia bienen cosas piores
Why can't people stop driving find a high spot pull over.  Stay home.
We need the rain, but if you live in low areas you should always be alert.
thank you!
How 'bout those climate change issues that aren't really happening 😵‍💫
The TDS is strong in this comment section! Rent free in your empty domes!
Texas Senators and Governor get paid big money to tell everyone global warming is a lie. That hundreds of years of Science and data is wrong
As long as the propane and propane accessories is safe
Prayers for everyone & everything in the areas 🙏🏾
R there gators n teaxs ?
한국 경찰들은 이렇게 도움 주지 안잔아
Smh
There are messages to be taken away from all these disasters. Wakeup people. Look to the bigger picture. And we aren't talking about global change. It's bigger than that.
The poor animals..
Don't worry Texas there is no climate change this isn't a real flood just fake news just ask your gop state leaders....
It’s going to be funny trying to charge your electric car in flood waters talk about electric shock treatment.
Did Cruz take a boat to Cancun this time?
WETHER modifications
Its called GEOENGINEERING, (watch the DIMMING by Dane Wigington)  it will open your eyes to what is happening
That sucks. Thoughts and prayers
Keep voting in climate change deniers, enjoy your new river.
We had over 6 inches in less than 24 hours. That is how much you can expect during a hurricane. This is not normal. It’s man made. From drought to flooding. Thank your government. They are causing all this weather and upcoming food shortages.
Texas needs more retention ponds like Florida mandates to alleviate flooding.
Baby boomers thought they could leave without seeing global warming. Not gonna happen boomers
Back in the day they would blame God's wrath, Now of days, we just call God's wrath, "Climate Change". Oh well natural selection.
I saw a video the woman woke up. Her house was flooding inside. Poor thing. She was screaming. I hope everyone gets to safety.  Praying for you Dallas🙏❤
Greedy oil companies should not make profits by DESTROYING the environment. Vote blue 💙💙💙 for environmental justice and abolition of fossil fuels!
KARMA RAIN TEXAS 😅😄😃😂
Words have power.
Weird. It's almost like all the global warming predictions have been incredibly accurate. Bigger storms due to more humidity in the hot air. Hotter avg temps.
he was making sure they did not trip over anything since u couldnt see they ground.. Come on Man how old are u
So Texas was just in a major drought.   If they get a storm they flood.   Very poor sewer systems there.
To all the Climate Change tards,  Stevie Ray Vaughan wrote a song about this particular event in 1983.  This has been going on for a while lol
Global Warming is here.
Tots and pears.
Dallas do not worry, Canadian Knight Rafael Cruz will come to the rescue.
No federal dollars
Time to invest in knee high rubber boot stocks
This is NOT NEWS. Every time that I've flown into DFW for the last 40 years, the plane circles over all the flooding for 1/2 hour before landing.
I was raised in and still live in that area. I've seen flooding at those places before. But, that was before "climate change" so it's special now!
Well Texas, let’s see what Abbot and Cruz have to say ………….  Oh, OK ……….. they don’t care, they’re RICH !! It’s not THEIR problem, it’s YOURS !!! Keep Voting in Useless People in your Government. It’ll be like you have No Government at All. They’re too busy Lining their Pockets to Worry about YOU !!!
I love watching that firefighter trying to mop up the water from the flood. Great job! Keep up the great work sir.
Geoengineering Weather Warfare
Climate change is very real.
Flood insurance will become a thing of the past
Wow I just heard of this now
Sorry folks but the Government running our country (Democrats)too busy to help y’all because they are spending all of our money to give hand outs to other countries.
Well, the bright side is they can stop worrying about drought for a while
And to answer the question: NO CALIFORNIA, you cannot have any of our water!
But Domino's useing frozen dough.... its sooo gross and the cheese is unnoticeable... Cant even see or taste cheese ...what r they using as fake cheese???
Amazing, these people overwhelmingly voted for people who railed about the reality Dallas is currently experiencing, and will do it again. The very definition of stupidity.
Wholesale re people rubbing their hands like mr burns
This video makes me sad. I used to live in Frisco. I love Dallas.
Karma
I live just west of Dallas/Ft Worth and we've got less than an inch of this rain.  It's very spotty where it is occurring.  We've only had 2.5 inches in 15 months here.  Nothing will grow outside.  It's all just dirt.
oh no i in Dallas and forth worth
America are you number one in anything let me guess number one in not thinking ahead in anything for instance your infrastructure
WOW! I wonder what they did to make the Baby Jesus so mad at them. Just have trump come down there and tell them that it never happened. They'll believe it.
Oh my goodness, crazy!
WEATHER MANIPULATION!!!
am i the only one who thinks it looks fun to drive through?
I DID THAT IN 1972 AGNES FLOOD NANTICOKE PENNSYLVANIA
The "Build back better" $ would be handy now. Oh shucks Texas did not vote for it. No worry they will be at the White House looking for a hand out.
Climate change is a democratic hoax!!!!! Anybody have a spare boat?????
Weather it’s been happening since the beginning of earth time in this galaxy
And yet millions of morons in Texas deny climate change
Driving through deep water will turn your engine into junk in no time. Water is not compressible.
In their video, I see a lot of pavement with no water on it.
ClIMaTE CHAnGe IS a myTh 🥴
