Block Facts did you that there's a another flying glitch in Minecraft bedrock edition that if you saddle a pig and put that pig on a boat and ride that and use a fishing rod and spam that fishing rod you keen fly in Minecraft
How do you get debug stick
One day i was playing Pokédrock mod with minecraft. Sometimes i would be kicked out of the game. When i came back to my world, the blocks' textures were COMPLETELY glitched and different. I reset the game. And everything was normal!
Did the diamond guy do something to logdodzip?!
the trick with the 8 blocks is not working
why is mr beast in the abckround at timestamp 2:15
Why  why why why?
Well I have a black dog so now the black dyed dog looks like my dog Lollipop (idk why I put that there probably no reason)

What is the name of the pack that shows the armor of the fox when you give it to them 🔥
3:18 did you know that you can dye your dog's fur in real life plus, I obtained the rarest glitch only happening to me. The glitch is what I call the texture lag. It just remakes the texture from multiple blocks into one. For example, dirt turned into a mix of diamond ore and barrier (for some reason). If this glitch happened to you, prove me wrong that this glitch only happened to me.
we need a #teamskys

I have discovered either a glitch or secret feature for bedrock edition First make a new world and make a seed that starts with: -1800 than make the world and there is a weird texture glitch that makes everything look purple, green and orange patterned Idk if it works in the new version  I had it on 1.16
Uhm one of my worlds in minecraft just became so inny and weird and I stopped playing because of the glitch 😢😂
I remember once I found 7 dragons with less health
Null was live in farlands
Thanks for telling us all of these facts block facts 😊😊
ik another glitch. if you play in 1.14 and you use the debug stick to play with the chest side thing, you can get an invisible chest
I am surprised you used the avalonia theme around 6:00
Twi shorts what are you doing here
In creative mode I spawned the wither and my game glitched out
So many smp members
Number 36 is Mojang just hating Minecraft players
Swimming might also make you phase through one block gaps like elytra in bedrock, also the glitch is more likely to occur when you are lagging
THE DEBUG STICK IS FAKE IN BEDROCK EDITION!!!!
Gliches? Don’t you mean features
They are features
2:11 Welp, looks like we need to wait 999 years for it to finish.

This always makes me want to play minecraft
2:04 When you create a map, a file of the map gets created. When the map gets deleted from the world, the map file is still there, and can take up some space on your device. It also works on Java Edition I think
I once found a stronghold with no portal room. I loaded up creative mode and it WAS RIGHT AT SPAWN NO JOKE. I dug in it and couldn’t find the room so I went on spectator, AND THERE WAS NO ROOM. Most annoying thing that’s ever happened to me.
I really had a glitch in bedrock while I was teleporting to the farlands i noticed the big hole And I think it is a chunk glitch
Yeah, The Nokia 3310

#𝚃𝚎𝚊𝚖𝚂𝚎𝚊𝚜
Fact: by using the /replaceitem command in bedrock edition you can make your dog wear armor you will not see it and it will not effect your wolf but if you kill it then it will drop the item but with low durability sadly Command: /replaceitem entity @e[type=wolf] slot.armor.head 1 netherite_helmet   If you want your wolf a chestplate then replace the slot.armor.head with slot.armor.chest here is the list   Slot.armor.head- The head  Slot.armor.chest- The chestplate  Slot.armor.legs- The leggings  Slot.armor.legs- The boots

Me and my friend found colored grass one day. We were confused and somewhat freaked out, though it was Herobrine lol  And once me, my sister, and my friend made a survival world, we went to fight the ender dragon then it disappeared? Looked for a while, I found the central portal open when we haven't killed it yet. Went through and it was making a tire shape at spawn, no idea how that happened but me and another friend wanted to make a book out of it!

the flying squid glitch still happens on my friends 1.18.2 server called traumasmp I literally see it happen every time I'm harvesting wheat from my farm to breed my sheep and I always take a screenshot too. Yes I built my wheat farm beside a river because I was lazy.
The red tree would look scarier if there is a creepypasta on top
ive once naturally in survival gotten a glitched red wolf
Mojang watching this be like: write that down write that down
8:08 solution: dig the (insert block) down or just water bucket mlg

Minecraft bedrock is bad and unpolished
I once got in a mineplex survival server and then I saw different colors grass when I log back in it became normal
This dude does a video in 10:53min for 42 facts while some people do 15 facts in 30:00min
For testing the glitch 3:23
You forgot the best one for pocket where you die while swimming it makes you normal but you can go through one block small gaps even if it was barriers and bedrock
I love The little big planet Avalon music playing in part of the video :>

No joke that stone glitch happened to me on switch
Kb-44m
The fact that me and my friend found a monolith without cheats or anything is crazy we lost that world now tho
9:20 now it all make sense I spend 2 hours (i was bad at that time) to went to the stronghold then i can’t find the portal room so i was so frustrating that i enabled cheat to find it and still can’t. (Also i’m also bad at English)
5:05 herobrine underwater

I'm a bedrock player and i think i found out a glitch. Whenever i log out of my world while mounting something, all the mobs in the visible chunk would disappear without a trace when i logged back in. It happened twice, both of them are in my seperare survival worlds.      But, there was a glitch which left me devastated for months. So, basicly the stort starts like this,      It was a normal day after kidnapping several Axolotl families and force bred them to get the blue axolotl but nothing happened. I decided to breed the slaves i kept in my basement for weeks. They had a child and i tightened security up a bit. A few seconds after getting out of my room, i went back in and saw the baby villager escaped.       I brought him back into the cage and doubled the layer. But he kept escaping for 5 times straight. And so, i was frustrated and killed the child. Then i went to do my normal crop farming routine. The next day, i was feeling strange that it was quiet. I checked the Aquarium and was shocked to see nothing was inside. I went to every part of the base and farm and nothing! Except for the bees, they're fine. Every single mob in existence went missing including my pets. And that's the story. It was me and my bro's survival on the switch. We played using splitscreen.      Therefore, we call it the "Despawnation Incident".  It all happened because i killed a child.  Wait a sec-

I know how to make it so you can ALWAYS have your hit box 1 block tall. It isn’t occasionally, while it does happen, you need to get onto water, sprint swim until you drown. Then, your hit box will be 1 block tall and able to walk through blocks. Be careful in the strip mine!

nice #supermarioidessycapkimdommusic
with the elytra hitbox glitch thingy in bedrock, I once found someone's secret room on an smp on accident. I believe the glitch is still around (January 4th, 2022) and it's pretty funny sometimes, it's also useful
Also, in bedrock edition if you drown in your swimming animation your hitbox stays 1 block tall.
The18th glitch made players vex's

My world got corrupted with a new update a monument was half in a mountain making some blocks of the monument in the mountain  also the mountains were split in half so you could find allot of emeralds
4:47 yeah.. the elytra glitch doesn’t work anymore on my world… It worked only when hitting a block while gliding
When I was a kid there was a glitch that deleted all my  worlds
I was wondering if u know what happened to my world in minecraft bedrock. My world had mixed up textures without applying any textures or mods. I did apply a shader previously but I took it off since I didn’t like the look of it (the shaders were Asthetic Fantasy Shaders) I have a vid about it on my small channel for more info! Thx
One of my servers had for stone and it still had a piece of island now

I don't know if this is a glitch but if you drink a night vision potion in the end, The sky would have like purple static  I don't know why :/
I love how he always uses so many dream smp characters
2:25 well that's how ghasts were made
a bug: mojang: what is that? a new feature?
I used the spawn protection thing to save my hardcore world
Your subtitles are amazing! This is what every subtitler should aim to achieve

Hey yo bro I just saw craftee in the video

Squid glitch
1:33 Parker and logdotzip..... I miss Alex 😭
1:32 hey! Thats craftee!
4:41 did anyone thought of using an ender pearl or is it just me
A remember finding a glitch a couple months ago were if you summon a rabbit on bedrock with any tag they become B I G  Unfortunately I’m pretty sure it’s gone now such is my beloved wife.
Is it concerning that me and my auntie found the far lands and the monoliths in a flat world on bedrock addition
01:33 Did he use the craftee skin?
3:03 The classic "Down here in the nether" animation from years ago.
6:13 [BIG SHOT]
Hee u copied the second boat glitch from my video🙄🙄
Not to show off but my world size is of 502 mb
Listen, you brought up some really interesting things, but I could not ignore the hyperactive personality. Usually people use this technique to get people to keep watching even the boring parts, but your video is actually really interesting. I know you probably know better than me what you should do, but I think the personality of a "researcher who has found hidden truths and is now telling them to you" is more appropriate to the content you are producing. Anyway, this video is really great, and I really liked it.
Yeah why Mojang every time I have to have dreams luck just to find a portal room I'm an og pocket player I was playing since 1.4
There's one time where my friend's world git glitch cuz he update his mc in pocket edition by the way all the grass has random patches of grass and leaves where green red dark blue light blue purple orange almost every color
I love when we played in 1.8 -12 when we join at the same time and our dogs would were redstone or lapis blocks
One thing that glitched out a fox was just a giant blue green red black glitch type screen like technical difficulty thing texture but with the eyes and mouth staying the complete same shape the exact same and I don’t know what happened it was disgusting
why was society futuristic before powered rails
6:14 SPAMTON DIALOGUE NOISE SPAMTON DIALOGUE NOISE
Microsoft: so how do you fix glitches?  Minecraft developers: call them a feature.  Microsoft: Big brain ima buy the game.
lol the cobblestone house and tree in nether, only OGs remember
Tested it after I wrote I had not tested it
Also I’m in 1.18.0
Wolf glitch has NOT been fixed in 1.18.0
I have not tested the wolf glitch in 1.18
Not that high tough. Only a few block
Also you will be launched into a boat on a slime block even if you don’t jump on it. I have NOT tested this in 1.18
Also in my first 1.18 world in a savannavillage there was was a early growth stage wheat block and a beetroot block which were not on farmland.
1.18
The fire glitch. I discovered it a long time ago in 1.17.41. If you light something on fire. Warning I never tested it with anything besides a flint and steel. If you then break the block and place another block there it will still be on fire. I tested it in 2.18 and it has been patched. I also have never told anybody else about this Not even Mojang
3:26 I never understood why that happened
5:23

Block facts, do you know the immortal dog glitch? Well, it's actually not immortal. Once you throw a splash potion of instant harming on them, well... Let's say it aint gonna be good.
Mom can i not go to school for today? mom: when pigs fly me: shows her that mc glitch* mom: fine...
i remember when tridents were first added i threw the trident to the enderdragon and it died like instantly
Believe it or not, on servers in bedrock edition, if your internet connection sucks enough, you don’t even need an elytra to pass through 1 block spaces. If your internet is bad enough you can walk through one block tall gaps. The only issue is you take suffocation damage while doing so.
Gotta love it going fast and not leaving you the time to process no hate

5:30 you can’t blame Mojang for anything happening in Bedrock Edition, you can blame Microsoft Game Studios for any of those problems. They don’t know how to correctly implement Mojang changes ever…
I like how he doesn't completely ignore bedrock edition
10:17 Foxes can still wear armor in Bedrock edition, and it’s a great trick so that they won’t die!
deltarune chapter 2 spamton voice spotted 6:13
I love all the sound effects keep up the good work
10:38 “Eventually, Mojang realized that this would be inevitable” *shows Thanos* I see what you did there ;)

I once fell into a gravel/lava pit that held me there at y9 so I obviously quite left for 5-10 minutes and then went back in to except my fate of losing more than a stack I diamonds and almost all my gear But when I went back in I was on fire on the surface….
oh the color glitch actually happened to me and I was on bedrock edition and I think it was because I died and was at 69420 on the x axis and had to come back to 0 0 in less then a second
4:41 in which block facts temporarily forgets about ender pearls
2:24 Nice Squid Game reference.
5:02
Wow I actually remember that squid glitch where they would fly away randomly
bro the dirt pole one is so easy to counter, just jump on the bed off of the pole..
On bedrock if you mix 2 different slabs together then place a item frame on it it will float even if you break the top slab (mix the slabs by placing a block then place different slabs on each row of the block)
half of this is only for bedrock
Yo that super flat nether roof is a lie! The block glitch though with an ender pearl trick to first do it was discovered in bedrock and has since been able to do there. It wasn’t possible in Java before but is now
YOU CAN GIVE YOUR DOG ARMOR

4:55 that glitch happens if you crash into walls with enough speed.
Can u tell me how u make ur game colours so vibrant
2:15 I love how Mrbeast is in the back ground pause that time
DO I HEAR OLD BATTLE MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND?!
Oi
4:45 this happens to me without elytra
Sweet!
Ok why does all the smaller YouTubers say bedrock is better than Java but more popular YouTubers say Java is better?
When i was young i had a superflat world on my friends computer and monoliths were everywhere i then just switched to survival and survived it was amazing
So a glitch i found on bedrock was if tou leave when falling in lava you get teleported somewhere nearby, i saved 3 stacks of iron ore this way when mining on accident
Their was a bug in Minecraft bedrock when 1.16 came out that would make it so like 500 dragons would spawn and you had to kill all of them to “complete”the game.
9:09 my mind when I have a double page math test due tomorrow:
Hi
Just i noticed that whan he said glitch there was spamton's voice on the background?

I feel like this guy did some 2b2t research legendary.
oh tought i corrupted minecraft whe ni saw it for the forst moment
I love these glitches. I would want a discord mod instead of just a omlet arcade call.
The one block hit box glitch is very frequent for me on mcpe. It bends the game in funny ways and you can make hidden bases. It only really happens on laggy realms and servers, but worlds have it too.
2:37 this happened to me 2 years ago, i didnt know why, but i found this video and now i know why it happened
Your voice is differnt

That stronghold not having a portal bug is really freaking me out. I don't remember ever seeing a stronghold without a portal and I don't know of speedrunners who found one either. Could be a Mandela Effect.
Who dyes their whole dog, that's weird
Trees being able to grow through dirt is most likely the result of a piece of code that the developers added to allow trees close to walls of terrain to generate
This has coincidentally become #42 on trending.
yooo its 42 on trending and its 42 facts wow
4:41 I always come across this glitch when I play on a server I like, it's so annoying. But it also let's you bypass plot protection so I'm not complaining

(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
God the console mini game music really brought me back
4:50 So I actually accidentally found this glitch, and, after it happened too much, I tried to find out why or how I can do it. So, if you use a trident with riptide (I don’t think the level matters, but mine was 3) and then start to use your elytra during the animation I think, you’ll have this glitch. Also fun fact, you can use an elytra and riptide trident during rain to go extra fast (I’m talking like 500 blocks a second)
How u got custom character creator item? I kinda want that (blue shirt, team seas hoodie)
Are you British?
booluga
Block fact can we get a debugstick in pocket edition 1.17 ?

Nice
mario music, lbp music, AND team seas? W 🙏
Is this why people hate Bedrock Edition? :(
I love you Blocks fact
If you hit a tamed wolf 9 times and hit it with healing pot and damage pot at the same time will make it unkillable it might look glitched so you rejoin the game... But..  Damage pot kills it... But its unkillable like lava wont kill it or even the void wont kill it
6:09 you can here the Avalonia music from LittleBigPlanet 2.
#TeamSea
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
What's the command for the wolf armor? Does anyone know?
I once spawned one of these red dogs just trying to make a normal one

5:25 Only happened in Bedrock Edition.
2:00 until 2:11 Oh now i know why my world get bigger mb because i make maps !   Bro this is cool glitch too if Minecraft make glitch in java edition. Unless mojang don't want added that glitch to the java and mojang too don't want added an enchanting book of ice aspect.  In fact that book when you hit entity and player it got completely freeze and it's actually 10 seconds to gone some ice of your body but actually if you go like place a snow maybe it's take a long gone icy of your body skin.    Iw Minecraft added that enchantment book like ice aspect because it's awesome but i hope mojang added that.   (It's actually i want say about glitches Minecraft but it's literally i say about mojang don't want added to game 😂)
Nice spamton reference
3:55 This only works in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, it can teleport you to a safe spot.
1:20 This only works in Java Edition
1:00 This only works in Bedrock Edition.
0:35 Except that it’s only on Bedrock Edition

I discovered number 31 on my pwn with my friends and we had so much fun with making a hidden entrance sky base using it
6:09 Is that Avalonia? Damn didnt know you're a man as culture as well.
Monthly dose of Minecraft Facts
A lot of these are bedrock edition only, therefore can't be used on java (or in manhunts)
Mining away
Actually for number 18, in bedrock edition, if you die while in swimming position, when you respawn your hit box is one lower causing that same glitch.
9:15 I was speedrunning the game for the first time and for some reason, every stronghold had no portal
What the dog doin 🤔
Ignoring the fact that that’s definitely the golden gourd from toh at 1:17 and 7:05
hi

Big fat seedy chicken with a sertified chicken drip
Glitch number 4 only works on the bedrock edition of Minecraft
I saw a dog with armour and I clicked
Good to see how he explaining bedrock glitches that fancy and not annoying anymore (some not all)
I know how to fix corruption. Step 1: Get a steampunker villager. Step 2: Buy green solution and clentaminator from steampunk villager. Step 3: Purify world.
Yo super early
4:28 leaves don’t turn white on bedrock? I’ve been playing Minecraft Bedrock since around 2012 and I’ve never seen white leaves that aren’t a texture pack or modded.
Fly with boat ⛵
Hello block facts I love all the knowledge you know about minecraft and you disiced to share your knowledge thank you for all of your amazing content keep the good work up
If you play the video at 0.25x speed he sounds like he normally does XD
Honestly what should be the name for the slime block boat glitch
Managed to create a lag glitch that would let you place lava and water right next to each other or in the same block Mainly if you lag the game too much with a very high tick speed
There is a corruption glitch in bedrock edition of Minecraft that just resets everything in your world.  You lose your items, your builds and your levels .
this dude's right arm must be super sore after recording
Finally I can actually follow what he’s saying because he’s not speaking at 200 mph
