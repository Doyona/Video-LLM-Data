To know that all people who rioted are now free confuses and scares me.

Serving satanic place praise God hallelujah
Do you still have the press code?　 プレスコードは今もあるノか？ 「　Allied Supreme Commander General Headquarters Source: Wikipedia　」 （連合国軍最高司令官総司令部　：Wikipedia参考）  The press code refers to the speech control carried out by the GHQ (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers) in 1945  after the defeat.  プレスコードとは、敗戦後の1945年、GHQ（連合国軍最高司令官司令部）によって行われた言論統制のことである。 It is a rule established for Japan, which has become a defeated country, and its official name is called "Newspaper compliance that can be given to Japan." The main censorship targets were articles about the GHQ criticism of the ruler and the atomic bomb　and  Koreans.  敗戦国となった日本に対して定められた規則で、正式名称は「日本に与うる新聞遵則」と呼ばれる。主な検閲対象は統治者であるGHQ批判や朝鮮人、原爆に関する記事が該当しました。 At this time, because the Koreans were recognized as victorious people, the Koreans in Japan terrorized the Japanese people with the crimes of robbery, rape, and murderous demons in Japan.このとき、朝鮮人を戦勝国民に認定したので、在日朝鮮人は日本国内で強盗、強姦、殺戮の悪魔の犯罪で日本国民を恐怖に落とし入れた。 The US Occupation Army was also a criminal group that invaded Japanese houses and committed tens of thousands of assaults and rapes of women and girls. アメリカ占領軍も日本人家屋に侵入し婦女子の暴行、強姦を数万件働いた犯罪集団であった。 The Japanese people were not protected from anyone in the world by robbery, murder, and rape by the American occupation forces and smuggled Koreans. アメリカ占領軍、および密入国朝鮮人による強盗・殺戮・強姦に日本国民は世界中の誰からも保護されなかった。 The Japanese people were detained from the freedom of speech to inform the Japanese people of the criminal acts of the US Occupation Forces in newspapers, radio and books. 日本国民は、このような犯罪のアメリカ占領軍GHQの犯罪行為を新聞、ラジオ、書籍で日本国民に知らせる言論の自由を拘束された。  In Japan under GHQ, the Constitution of Japan was enacted and Article 21 allowed freedom of expression, but freedom of speech was practically restricted. GHQ統治下の日本では、日本国憲法が制定され、第21条によって表現の自由が認められたが、言論の自由は実質的に制限された状態となっていた。  Therefore, a publicity plan called WGIP (War Guilt Information Program) was started to instill the guilt of war in the hearts of Japanese people.  そのため、WGIP(ウォー・ギルト・インフォメーション・プログラム)と呼ばれる戦争の罪悪感を日本人の心に植えつけるための宣伝計画が開始された。  The content of the press code includes the ongoing "prohibition of criticism of China and Korea." プレスコードの内容に、現在も継続している「中共、韓国、朝鮮への批判禁止」がある。  Currently, the reason why naturalized Koreans in Japan are not exiled from their home countries and are protected more than Japanese is because the Japanese rule structure by GHQ protected by this press code exists. 現在、在日、帰化朝鮮人が母国追放もされず、日本人以上に保護されている理由はこのプレスコードで保護されたGHQによる日本人支配構造が実存するからである。 The Korean comfort women issue is a product of the Japanese National Rule Organization by Koreans in Japan planned by GHQ. 朝鮮人慰安婦問題はGHQが計画した在日朝鮮人による日本国民支配機構の産物である。 If Japan wants to be a true ally of the United States, it must abolish the UN Enemy State Clause. 日本国をアメリカの真の同盟国にしたいと希望するなら、国連の敵国条項を破棄しなければならない。
Another democrat
usa today...try reporting the truth you ass clowns. 2 people died of medicals , 1 died of an overdose and 1 was an innocent white girl murdered by a black cop. The capital cop who died was the next day and he had a medical issue , he was never hit by a fire extinguisher , lies. Nothing got burned unlike all the actual riots all summer by thieves, arsonists, and attackers. They murdered cops and anyone who disagreed with their bullshit lies they believe.
Prayers for the capital police officer and his family. As for the other newly deceased, well....  🔥💩🔥
The cryptocurrency market leader set a new lifetime high of $51,348 early Wednesday, having penetrated the psychological level of $50,000 on Tuesday for the first time, I already started investing with Mr Luiz and I guess y’all should act.
3 died from heart attacks and strokes. One was shot by police accidentally. And one was an officer hit in the head with a fire extinguisher and died. So really only 2
I hope Biden administration should abolish cops and replace them into military or let them train into afganistan so that they will experience how battlefield and street chase and stop being unrespectfull to the military war vet
LOL , wow 4 dead ..... only 100 more capital riots to reach BLM riots numbers  ...
This will lead to Total Chaos worst than Civil War..
CHAOS MODE...
One protester killed by a cop- and 3 others died off the grounds of medical conditions? this headline makes it look like the protesters were on a murder rampage- more fake biased "news".
Names of these people?
Its Donald Trump's fault. I think he should cover funeral expenses of four dead people besides he is a billionaire.
Officer dies, but no details of how he died. Apparently related to injuries on the 6th.  Undisclosed.  Why?  wouldn't that make the case better?  Another who "collapsed" at 5pm, no cause reported. she wasn't in the capital, she was an attendee.  Breaching Events occurred around 2.  Details are important.  We need them.  Another death was a stroke of an attendee?  Another a heart attack?  No mention if they were anywhere near the capital building. I saw ambulance  take a person early in the day, near the White house, during the speech.  No violence happening.  Could this have been one of these guys? Another shot by capital police.  A retired Air force Vet who worked intelligence unlawfully breached the US Capital building then with guns pointing at her decided to climb up onto the door.  One video tells of a guy who tied to help her after she was shot, she says shes ok, then she collapses on him.  Another video shows no such thing but she is climbing up the door, even with police behind her.  then the Chief of police "apparently" commits suicide.  And that's the word that is used.  Apparent.  It's all quite fantastic.  People died.  Terrible.  People bashed windows.  Terrible.  Their names and faces should be blast all over the internet and the news.  People have been arrested.  Blast it all over the news.  Imprison them all.  Lets get all the True details.
💕🇺🇸 USA & East Turkistan ☪️ 💕 God Bless America 🇺🇸& East Turkistan ☪️!!!!
Maybe the capital police supports trump && let them go in cuz they see the corruption , & remember’s democratic’s wanted to defend the police 🤔🤔🤔👀👀 .. conspiracy theory or facts ?
Dear USA citizen voters of trump or biden lets come together and do a new voting again BUT no mailing vote.   No need  killing each other.  The upper politics like biden..obama...clinton   and ttrump businessman still have meals good food and wine on the table each day.   Jus do a vote again.   Simple solve the problem.  But remember do not do mail voting.
I am heartbroken, that anyone died in this incident.  Where was kamala Harris,  Joe biden,  Nancy pelosi and all of those so called Republicans calling for the removal of our President. Where were they during the extreme violent riots that killed Mr Dorn and 100s of others 1000s injured, helpless old lady in a wheel chair beaten and robbed right on camera by blm ,antifa , rapes destroying our national monuments , destroying countless businesses,  some black owned businesses.  Looting everything in sight. I tell you where they were, they were on tv saying (Harris) they've been rioting and will keep rioting after the election and they should keep doing it. ( pelosi) oh well people are gonna do what people do. ( nadler) antifa is a myth,  the only place its being talked about is in DC by the right wing . Cnn reporter literally standing on the street saying this is mostly a peaceful protest, while businesses were literally on fire behind him in the video. Cuomo  ,saying sometimes a violent protest is necessary,  he continues,  who says all protest have to be peaceful. And on and on.  Nobody called for their removal except President Trump.  Nobody else. Where was the media condemning the democrats for booing God at their convention? Where was the media when nadler stopped the pledge of allegiance to our flag and stopped the prayer before a committee meeting. Nobody called for his removal.  You people that want this kind of thing are disgusting individuals. You're not Americans. PRESIDENT Trump called for a peaceful March on jan 6th several times during his speech that day. And once he found out that some protesters on their own were part of the breech to the capital building,  he immediately called in the national guard.  There is video of some of the capital police letting some of the protesters into the capital building,  stepping aside and letting then walk in peacefully. Who gave that order? It wasn't Trump.  There are some known antifa and blm members that were among the Trump supporters that breached or were let into the capital building.  My guess is ,they are the ones who became violent once inside. No media coverage of that at all. My heart-felt prayers go out to the families of all who were killed or injured in all of the riots, including what happened at the Whitehouse.   The left and some rinos  have lost their minds.

PORTLAND? BIDENS LAPTOP? INDICTMENTS WAITING FOR BOTH BIDENS IN UKRAINE.. FELONIES?
PIGS Cant even do their jobs!  If BLM had invaded the Capitol would they have behaved the same way?
They make it sound like 5 were murdered but 2 of them died of natural causes: heart attack and stroke.
If they were black they'd be hailed HEROS. When will All Lives Matter Again.
Forced entry? Some people were shown on video that worked in the White House opening doors for the rioters to enter. Also the police let them just walk right in. Another staged event.
so will you fight for them like in BLM?
That interpreter keeps distracting me! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤭
Lol "what happened to defund the police! Police are pigs! And people rioting threatening to kill police and their families?" Burning and destroying buildings businesses vehicles when all of that was ok
Now it's five can you Americans stop for a day
This is the people that get mad for taken a knee peacefull in front of the flag..will they used to beat and almost kill American blue lifes..
Lock him up!!!!lock him up!!!
Hooligans country hooligans president
WE ARE ALL ASHLEY BABBIT.
Just 4? Oh well...wait for COVID-19 to start taking effect.
I'm sorry but that Sign Language was Fire!
I want to see a MF try protecting these Trump Supporters
It remains to be seen how your true elected officials react to this!!!! With vocal disdaind/condemnation or with real action!!!!! Trump is obviously unstable and should be removed before he kills more people!!! Not only has he failed to address the pandemic he has incited an attempted coup!!! Is this not a treasonous act under the laws of the "UNITED STATES of AMERICA"! Or have you truly become ununited!!!!! 200 plus yrs of peaceful democracy thrown away for one mans ego!!!!!
Glory to patriots! F***k BidON
All because a disagreement between two  people smh
If you're involved in a crime such as this, if anyone dies, all the criminals involved are responsible for those deaths and should be charged as such. If you recognize anyone, say something. Let's catch all these scumbags who are guilty of murdering these people. We know they involved people from both sides. Let's get them all and charge them with murder. This is America. Not some third world shithole. Let justice be served under the constitution of the United States of America.
Hey USA Today, please fact check your stories.....stop with your left leaning editorial garbage and just report the news. I know this will be a crazy concept to you but you should really consider giving it a try.  Currently all you are is a Democrat hype rag, critical coverage of Trump every day(who is a complete idiot) but you fail to do the same for Joe Biden (who is also an idiot with dementia).
BABYLON(America) THE GREAT IS FALLEN, IS FALLEN!
This is such a shame and a black mark on our democracy. Antifa infiltration into legitimate causes has been the reason for any illegitimate civil unrest regardless if political affiliation. They are so shameful. Throw them all in prison.
Wait are Americans really so fat they just drop dead at rallies?
Unfortunately, since the November election, Donald Trump has completely lost the plot and the worst elements of his character have surfaced.   Of course, he had every right to challenge the election results in the courts, but, whether we like it or not, the judges - even the conservative ones - were not convinced by the evidence he presented. And this did not happen once, but many times. Somewhere there, then, the whole story should end. But Trump continued, playing with fire, and that's how we got to the recent episodes at the Capitol.  But as unacceptable and condemnable as the invasion of the Capitol is, it is just as ridiculous to hear that hundreds of artists wearing ... calf heads attempted a coup or that it was ever possible for the democracy of the world's most powerful country to be endangered by ... Bleck and his company! Such notion is of course ludicrous and yet this is exactly the narrative that the Democrats have been promoting.  And rest assured that, with the help of the media, Soviet Valley and Hollywood, this narrative will become dominant in the years to come. The philanthropic elites will take full advantage of these events and turn a blind eye to the feeling that democracy is threatened by hordes of dangerous fascists (many already parallel the Capitol’s invasion with the burning of the Reichstag!).   In this climate of crisis and demonization of their political opponents, any conservative citizen who speaks out against them will automatically identify with the jerks in the Capitol and his political discourse will be marginalized on social media.  The censorship will be harsher than ever (Trump's Facebook and twitter accounts have already been suspended) while Democratic Party politicians, who for so many years have promoted violence and despised the popular verdict (see "deplorables") have already worn the halo of the witness of the Republic!   And of course under these circumstances the dangerous agenda of the Democrats will be able to be imposed much more easily.  As for Trump, with his mistakes and inability to control his temper, he ruined his backwardness and will leave power ashamed, even if he had a term with many achievements and successes, even if he did well in the elections of November. And unfortunately, alongside him, the movement will receive a huge blow. This movement that is so necessary nowadays in the fight against political correctness, coronary fascism, political globalization, egalitarianism and uncontrolled immigration  No, US freedoms and institutions are not endangered by a handful of marginalized guys. But they are in danger from those who today are projected as their so-called defenders. They are in danger of re-establishing a ruthless elite, with a dangerous and unfree agenda, which controls almost completely the media, social media and entertainment and which, after four years away from power, is thirsty to get its blood back.
4 is an understatement won't you say?
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Bullet catching is never a good idea She was ready to die for ignorance and her actions had consequences.
USA is crazy
Dead or fight? Right!!!
You died for a cause, period!! Trumpet promised them 2 hours before to walk together to Capitol and fight...fuc... LIER. You brain watch ur own idiots.
You will have to review what you have done all over these years stabbing Americans in the back. This is the consequences of your corruption. There will be worse things happening when Biden is President because you've served the Corporate State, not US citizens.
The purge finally real life
This is terrorism
Sharpest and finest sign language person I ever seen on the news
So sad dying for trump
I wanna  know who order them not to shoot?
It was only Antifa that died so no harm done, just less we have to deal with and kill at the end! To bad more wasn’t shot to help the purge....
Iran is watching US weakness
JUSTICE FOR ASHLI BABBIT PATRIOTS 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Media is a deadly force.
now look back at Hong Kong protest, that shit lasted month and y'all killed 4 people in one day
These weren't demonstrators or protesters, the were rioters.
The cause of all this because people believe in garbage conspiracy theories. Conspiracy feeds fear in the minds of people and cause them to do harm on others and of course this situation.
None of any riots have done anything but divide us
In  the Spring of 1970, I, with my sisters and my American school mates and many English and conscientious objectors, marched on Grosvenor Square, London, U.S. Embassy, to protest the killing of 4 innocent students at Kent State University in Ohio by the National Guard on orders of D.C.  The Democratic Party, Pence and the RINOs are complicit and guilty of the murder of 4 innocent patriots who were protesting the  blatant and egregious rigging of the presidential election, and because Trump, his lawyers and our elected representatives challenged it, they sought to use this tragedy to cover up their crimes.  Nixon was an easy target. These murderers hide behind the veil of liberalism.  They are the NIXONS  of my youth with their love of filthy lucre and endless wars.
The man doing sign language!!! They might want to check his credentials...
This is what you get supporting trump all these years selling your country down the river for your own economic gain
Ashli Babbitt shot in A Very well lit room, her hands holding her up and in clear view, doesn't that look like a self defence shot to me! If she was black Ben Crump ​would be standing next to her family doing another press release.
If this continues there could be a war against people vs Cops which I don’t want to see if it happens i will leave this state till it’s back together normal
If the US saw what the US was doing in the US, The US would invade the US to liberate the US from the tyranny of the US.
Nancy Pelosi:"A beautiful sight to behold"
pipebombs & molotov cocktails?! nice to hear King Trumps fanatics didnt burn down the house afterall!
Americas basket of deplorables exposed.
Operation US freedom.....Where is Bush?
This it's only the beginning of worst times coming.
It was all Trump fault.
Typical Trump supporters
JUST 4?
God will have His Way
Mexico is now considering paying for the wall after all.
Hey she cant say she didnt die for her country right? ...donkey of the week
DONT' BELIEVED WAS A SET UP TO DONALD TRUMP TO LEAVE THE PRESIDENCY TO BIDEN TRAITOR SOLD USA FOR $$ TO CHINA PCC  CONGRESS THEY ARE ALL CORRUPT........LORD PRAYER
i know that i probobly shouldnt say my opinion because if i say my opinion anywhere at least 10 people are gonna give me a list of why i am wrong and should be ashamed of myself, but why does this have to happen, if everbody just calmed down and respected everyone else none of this would have happened and people wouldnt have died, ive lost hope in america and politics as much as i dont really care are super f'd up right now, we need to get our shit together and its ok to have an opionion but people shouldnt die because one old dude got replaced by another old dude, please dont rip me to shreds in the comments about how im wrong and should go kill myself or some shit like that
They died victims of their own stupidity.
this is about white privilege....nothing more. the media is part of the enablers; if this was done by any other group..the language used to converse about this would be different. I dare any other group in america to try this and see their obliteration.  All this talk is manufactured consent.
Trump is the best president! down with karporatsyi, down with the wars around the world that the Pentagon unleashes, it is necessary to restore order in our country and not feed us with fairy tales about wars for democracy on foreign cantinents and scare other countries!!! because of the policy corporacy in the streets of some homeless people and crime!!! enough
Let's call them correctly. They're NOT RIOTS, they ARE TERRORISTS.
Who died and how???? More details!!!!! This is a joke!
Cyberpunk 2021
Clearly they didn't go to the capitol to peacefully protest...
No one cares about white lives
Pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails? Jesus Christ this could have gotten way uglier
Play stupid games win stupid prizes
Only thing I was watching was the brother doing the sign language representing.......👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
So the military superpower that is the United States that has drones, nuclear weapons, CIA, Navy Seals, Secret Agents, can't stop a few protesters from entering a public governmental building? It wasn't even a massive crowd like the ones we see in South America or the Middle East every time there is an uprising.   Maybe the USA is not used to have demonstrators in front of public buildings. It's a common thing in Europe. It's part of being a democracy with laws and rules. You should and are entitled to protest outside the buildings but you can't go inside. How difficult it is to keep people away? It seems like massive security fail.
Is that omarion doing sign language
Why were the front doors unlocked anyway I understand that people were inside but shouldn’t the front doors be locked all the time especially when there is a meeting going on of either the House of Representatives, the senate or congress isn’t there a back door  for members and staff to enter and exit from.  If there’s not a fence around the Capitol then the front door should be locked at all time.    All I see is that this protest found a huge hole in the security of the Capitol
What if that was Al'Qaeda or Isis? Is it that easy to get into Capitol Hill?
Lack of security!! Chief of capitol police Selling your soul ...
700 Billion $ for Defence. And then that...
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲(𝘀) 𝗼𝗳 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆  America is in a state of deep scrutiny. So is humanity. Today’s America presents the future state of humanity: If the world advances the way America is advancing, we will end up being divided between two blocs that hate each other in every sense—ideologically, approach to life, culture, education, and every other way. It will be impossible to connect the adversaries, just as it is impossible to connect the Democrats with the Republicans in today’s divided United States.  As things are, there will be no calm. It seems as though things have gone out of control, but they haven’t. It is simply what happens when the ego wants to govern and will not hear of anything less than that. It does not want connection; it wants domination.  It may be horrifying to watch, but we are merely witnessing the natural process. When everything revolves around who has more and who has less, and when the ego keeps intensifying, we come to a state where the ego wants everything, and to leave absolutely nothing to the other side. This is what you get when you don’t educate people.  It doesn’t matter how much you invest in aid packages and relief programs, when the ego comes to a state of all or nothing, nothing helps. Therefore, we should thank America for the example it is giving us, at its own expense. We should thank the American people for setting an example that demonstrates what our future will be like unless we achieve unity among us. In other words, if we don’t achieve a united state in humanity, humanity will become like today’s United States: an assortment of nations, colors, races, and faiths that hate each other to death, and do everything they can to cater to their hatred.
If a man were killed in the Kremlin, the "free world" and CNN would have yelled: dictatorship!  Google translate/
Amerika is a big JOKE !  🤣🤣🤣🤣 WE ALL LAUGH HERE .  POLICE JUST STAND AND LOOK. 🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍
Damn...i thought usa should be the safest in the world🤔
Nothing to feel sorry about, all those died due to their own fault..
“Warning ⚠️  This is the beautiful sight to behold🤪” Those rioters are HERO !🤨
They were let in by police
All those who stormed the U.S Capital building should be charged with 2nd degree murder .Murder in the second degree. Whoever with malice aforethought, except as provided in §§ 22-2101, 22-2102, kills another, is guilty of murder in the second degree. For purposes of imprisonment following revocation of release authorized by § 24-403.01 (b) (7), murder in the second degree is a Class A felony.
People are dead because of Rudy Giuliani with his 'Combat by trial', that provoked the this breach...
There are more peaceful demonstrators in the United States than in Hong Kong. After all, Hong Kong has already started to throw Molotov cocktails.  So please tell me why the Hong Kong protest is a pursuit of democracy and freedom.  But is the American demonstration a riot?
They are peaceful protesters.And they dead.
whos this guy in the bottom right doing some gang signs or something ?
Weak policing
I hope Iraq sends in troops to help secure American democracy.
Hmmm questionable with this police ? Deaths I get it there invading a peace of politics which sucks btw the most boring thing ever but 4 dead? Hmmm I don't think that it is needed there life should of been saved these police officers panicked?
Just 4 dead in a terrifying terrorist attack. Hypocrites
shame on trump
Why the migos on bottom right ?
Too much Internet and a lack of a decent education.
👍👍👍
Yes we finally have a Black Police Chief. Therefore there shall be no no more police brutality
Find and arrest all these traitors to our country.  Put them on a list as treasonous thugs.
I think people focus way to much on politics instead of there eternity and relationship with GOD and we know GOD exists because there has to be a creator of everything nothing cant create everything. politics cant save your soul from sin but because GOD is so forgiving he sent his son jesus all you have to do is repent of your sins acts 17 30 and trust in jesus christ john 3 16 then GOD will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift. one more thing the reason why i'm sharing biblical christianity instead of all the other religions is because they offer a works based salvation but the ten commandment's prove we have all fallen short of the glory of GOD for example have you ever lied or looked with lust or hated and biblical christianity is the only one that offers a savior which is jesus christ sent by GOD have a great day amen.
But why USA why
Murder charge
These people should be called terrorists
Breaking and Entering is a crime. Everyone involved in the savage attack of the Capitol should be jailed! The death of the airman/veteran (who was a member of the mob who were breaking and entering the Capitol and a party to the insurrection against the United States of America) was of her own doing - not the person who shot her in order to protect the Capitol and all those inside.
The republican s and democrats have played the American people for a year was good to see some pay back
Why does every body just keep blaming it on “trump supporters” there are many people there that just wanted to start trouble and make everything worse. But still all you see on the news if “trump supporters riot” why would trump supporters riot if he won the election
This story smells funny.
Booms that didn't explode...weapons gone  unused? Can't wait to hear their explanation for that.
The politicians that can get him out of there won't because they have skeletons in their closet. Believe me all of them are dirty
No disrespect player I know you had a shooting you know we had some injuries this Annette or once again you're not telling us why y'all to beef up security national guard you're not telling us that man so what you telling us brother it's just like a black man getting pulled over do you want to go home to his wife and kids so he just want to keep on moving and doing whatever the hell he was doing and peace it's a difference y'all watch just like Americans watch what was going on on the capital the House of Representative to where we have to film a black man getting shot and killed brutalize whatever so I guess I'm sitting here saying I pray that nobody else get hurt killed or whatever the case may be but all the deftos that we didn't have in America free America the land of the free when you get black young men pulled over buying a business chilling whatever the case maybe I'm not saying all and y'all don't stand down ya'll quit the firearm at the end of the fuking dead man so I sympathize in Waze but man how many black men have to die because of stupidity stupid ass cops but y'all want to talk about the capital and how y'all had people just come up in there freely doors wide open
USA 4 - 0 maga
Can’t win with these people, they can riot, loot, burn, gather, break the law, fight cops, and PROTEST.  But the second we protest it’s a different narrative... I’m tired of the hypocrisy.
OK, the one lady died from a gunshot and 3 others died of a Covid medical condition around the capital.  He said a medical condition.
Trump Supporters all Summer "blue lives matter"... then they beat them at the capitol
It’s called murder chief. An unarmed American citizen was murdered by law enforcement.
My pray goes to the police officers with my best wishes to quick recovery.
State funerals and burials at Arlington for all four. Defund the DCPD.
0:28 dropped something
PogChamp
Three died from "medical emergencies ".....what the hell does that mean?
Trump rioters who breached the Capitol building Wednesday left what appears to be minor damage to the 19th-century neoclassical structure
Sign language man dripped out the wazoo
I guess America wanted to spread democracy by invading itself this time
Why is there a rapper in bottom right?
Man the sign language dude is fineeee
Cocktails huh how much you want to bet these same people are the ones that rioted during blm protest.
How did they get injuryd all that riot gear on
What are these mysterious medical emergencies- nobody cares about cops with minor injuries
Play stupid games Win stupid prizes
Murder charges across the board then.
So 3 of em had heart attacks after walking up the stairs ? 😂
If people want to take part of a riot they should be prepared to die for it.
murderers!!!!
The reckless Trump has distorted the image of America, and he is the one who brought it to this dangerous level. He is the one who incited the storming and the fighting inciting the American to kill the American, and this is a very dangerous precedent and a red line. From the above from his despicable deeds
ANTIFA  WAS THERE TOO.
Best sign language translation I've ever witnessed ✊🏾😎
Demo-cracy only works when the losers in a free & unfettered vote accept it & get on with their life's till the next election. Trump has poisoned all of that sadly.
Did any newspaper anywhere call for people to turn in Antifa members that looted and destroyed property in Portland, Seattle, Chicago etc.? Didn't think so.
They're taking the presidency from Donald Trump so black lives matter will not come in and Riot and burn down the city
this is DemoRats fault for rigging elections...BIDEN RIGGED HIS NOW GA RIGGED IT FOR WARLOCK....
They should of shot all them mfs
hmm since there  trump supporters should trump get the blame 🤷🏽‍♂️
Swaggiest Translator I ever seen
It is sad that our congress and senate has led us to such a sad day.  My prayers go out to the law enforcement who suffered harm on such a terrible day.
This People must learn some JAPANESE style of mannerism
Antifa
Next time athletes kneel dont say a dam thing about disrespectful behavior toward the flag
Freedom of the United States from the occupation of the Democrats
white brothers fight for your co untry
This is democratic operatives, BLM, Antifa, & all the rest posing as Trump supporters. The Dems latest deception. Wake UP!  May God have mercy! The DNC will have God to answer to. But they don't fear God. They will fear on Judgment day.
Rest In Peace to the people killed prayers to their families 🙏🤍Prayers to everyone hospitalized 🙏🤍
How can those thugs, domestic territorist get this close to our Congress.
ANTIFA/BLM gets a pass....patriots persecuted
“bUt iT wAs PeAcFuL”
Absolute garbage if BLM were rioting there would have been a massacre this just shows the racist response america has for everything
Shouldn't the headlines read " Woman killed for carrying American Flag ." That was her only crime , you may say "That's not a crime ." well it is now . YOU! have lost America , or handed it over to the commies . Tell me I'm wrong in 4 years . And the back stabbing GOP is just as guilty . Like Messel Obama once said " I'm ashamed of America , and all the  so called leaders . People have been saying for years " It don't matter how you vote , they will put who they want in  anyway ." I never believed that till 2008 now I know its a fact .
my nigga doing sign looks slick, looks like he throwing up too
Dont worry people! Everything happening now is going to make America great again. ☺
Theres a lot the country could agree with, if left and right wanted to see each other eye to eye  The loss of life yesterday was tragic, im sure very few people today are satisfied with how the police behaves  As for the "fraud", there are 3 possible problems 1) the democrats committed fraud 2) someone tampered with the results 3) the people trust the system so little trump could convince them there was fraud  All this problems have the same solution, a stronger, more transparent voting system the majority of the population can trust, im sure both sides of the argument wouldnt oppose an improved system, but instead of seeking the understanding they continue to create division
Looking through the comments really hurts. Something like this should not be glossed over or supported but apparently quite a number of you right wingers support these terrorists actions. Glad to see you all share one braincell.
Set up!
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Trump still lost, still no fraud.
The sign language interpreter be like: 🤚🖐️✋🤏👆👈👉👇☝️🤞🤘✌️👌👎🤙🖖
0:36 I get 182 per day by using *f u n d a i l y p a y*
This sign language guy reminded me of Jose Zuniga
USA ...... dead and buried.  RIP.
Hell police officers protecting a building full of the politicians who wanted to defund them. Hey go right in I will leave the doors unlocked.
Good serves them right, If they had not of gone there then they would be alive today, But Trump is also to blaim for their deaths because he told them to go there, He is also Guilty of the Deaths of over 350,000 Americans by giving out misinformation about CV-19,  He needs to face the death penalty No Parole No special Deals, many Americans believed and did what he said and they paid with their lives, It's Time to Take His. Is my Opinion.
"...3 other deaths reported today.."   Have they been laying around dead somewhere since yesterday afternoon?  Can anyone expand upon "Medical Emergencies"?  It's pretty safe to say that all deaths result in a medical emergency.
I wonder how many caught the Covid19 while protesting,👀 just last week our number covid cases was so high but still we have this large  protesting from the percentage of cases in the U.S most of them should been home on their 14 day quarantine.  The Covid19 can not be as bad as it seems sorry for the deaths but I want to hear how many caught Covid19 while protesting face to face and shoulder to shoulder. I bet you the count was zero 😏
We are played like puppets by the very people we voted to protect us and uphold the laws! That break through was too too easy to happen! It was like they were let in to the building as a planned game!   But then, here we are in 2021 still being yoyo-ed along by the leaders of the government as if we don't know what's up! Shame!
Hey, cops, all that practice beating up unarmed protesters benefit you right now? Remember  not so long ago when you sent over a hundred cops in to break up  a memorial service for a guy who was beaten to death and people who knew him as a violinist turned out in a park to play in his memory? What's wrong? All those thugs with ar15s turned on you? Seriously? You never saw that coming?
Heard the police let the An tifa in it was said the police opened the gates so do not make it look like it was TRUMP SUPPORTEERS OR SOMETHING THAT TRUMP SAID OR DID BLAME THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT FAULT
Shouldn't it be USSA Today   Stars and Sickle .
There will be a day Ashli Babbitt monuments proudly arise around the beautiful land of America!
U.S of A-Holes.
BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS
Donald trumps votes ended up in the dumpster stolen election best president of all time Donald trump make America great again 👍☺
bandes ASSASSIN HONTE A L'AMÉRIQUE VOUS TUUUER GRATUITEMENT AMERIQUE corrompue
Where were the police that we're at the Capitol when the BLM protests that we're peaceful and there were 10times as many there then why not yesterday  show's what has happened to this country under Trump and his Republicans they all have to go vote Blue everytime have to save our country and that's the only way to do it and make America free again
I hope people are trying to justify the criminal that was killed for breaking into the U.S capitol building.
i understood everything the translator said
Justices For American peoples  Why is it the courts/judges don’t even cares to listen or see the evidences???? This’s the result ( All Leaders Must Repent) “God or Evil”
so you aloud viking to storm your capitol and shot to own army fighting for justice?!? goodbye u.s.a
Wait a minute… Wasn’t these kinds of activities called a peaceful protest for three months while cities burned people lost their lives and their businesses? But hey… When it comes to their place of business they freak out . The whole bunch are a bunch of cowards .
Hello America i m from india  I always love to see America because of freedom and democracy i never visit America.  But today all mirrors are break and i m laughing out loud dont know why...  But very shameful act not expected from America
You kill the innocent people,!
imagine realizing our capitol is defended by 4 dudes and furniture in front of a door, we pay WAY more than enough in taxes to expect our capitol to be actually secure - but evidently, this is a myth.
Americas 2021 year has been cursed already, here's wishing your country luck, your gonna need it, Trump should be punished, this is all his fault, he's sittin back laughing while the rest of your country is in shams, people have lost their lives because of this man, seriously what the Hell, I don't believe in God but I am praying for The US of A, i am so sorry you are all going through this, us Canadians are thinking of you
2021 we gonna make right
A germans perspective: *looks at BLM protests* *looks at capitol raids* Jaa i'll get my 0.50€ for betting on civil war in ze amerika.  Godspeed yanks
Yes I know! It’s sad moments for Americans and the whole world is watching.  I’m happy that they are going through this hard time, just because the Clown “Trump” is not funny no more!  I loved America like everyone else did, even though I am not American, but not no more, after that Clown in office.  Now he is responsible for those who died near by the Capitol. Plus those who died in the Pandemic.   We are all family if you look the earth!
Sorry for those people deaths  But no sorry they were looking for something to happen and it did  All nations were just watching those trump minions causing chaos from the comfort of their livingrooms crazy and the Tyrant Trump doesn't even care about you and your lost
More Tiny Hat shenanigans..
Lack of security...planned, or just incompetence? Also, the vast majority of over a million protesters did nothing wrong. I hope they tell us the truth about who they actually are. Could have been drunken good-ole'-boys, could have bern misguided but disillusioned Trump supporters, could have been ANTIFA. We need to know.
For some reason, I can hear that guy doing the sign language.
Absolutely disgusting trump its all on u the deaths u said u love the people then why u did this is on comprehensible
Imagine dying because of trumps ego.....oh wait!
At least these protesters knew where to go. Straight to the swamp. Leftists mob ransacked people's businesses, stores, burned down their properties for several months now.
Back the blue only matters when it’s convenient to them
You may think these officers shooting at pro-Trump supporters, armed or unarmed, might scare them off, but all i am being concerned is that this will only inflame tensions.
What the hell is going on the whole world is watching the United States of America Tear itself apart the governor of Mississippi announced it employees are owned by the employers what crazy train are we on
Привет  из Украины ! Из Киева! !!!!)))))))))
isleep with my musk on,
Things fall apart
Land of the free. Home of the brave.  ?
Lol
Legally speaking, can the insurrectionists also be charged with murder?
Bring the Mf ruckus
It has to be the Hong Kong police shot those people. Please do NOT out source our police force to Hong Kong.
Lies
ReBONKplikans 🤡🤡🤡
The real question,  Is Trump accountable for the deaths of those four people!?
Antifa are posting photos of themselves busting into capitol .Where antifa shows there is always violence ...WHY DOES THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PROTECT THEM ?
Where was all the coverage when antifa and BLM were burning down our country this summer???  It was ANTIFA that stormed inside the capital after BEING ALLOWED INSIDE BY POLICE...  this was a SET UP to make trump and trump supporters look bad ...  I am absolutely disgusted with everything right now.  Maybe they shouldn’t have LIED, CHEATED AND STOLEN our election and ppl wouldn’t be sooo pissed off!
Them nice English words ... all big n shiny 😂
Remember when black panthers stormed capitol with guns?
😭😭😭😭🙏🏾
They are called American Patriots!  That is how America was made, fighting against political tyranny! And if you do not learn anything from American citizens storming the Capital Building, then you are not only ignorant, but a fool, you lack wisdom, and self awareness and calling these Patriots terrorist is an injustice to our forefathers who fought with the same premise! The American citizens of this Great country have had enough of the corruption!  If you cannot change the political system by voting, then you no longer have a county of freedom!
The  Democrats are  the  ones  who  committed  the  crimes  you  dumb bunch  of  knot heads its know  wonder  Washington is  in the  shape  it is  in
If no shooting everyone be ok.
Yeah, cuz police have guns to kill.
So, USA gonan bomb who now?
Bullcrap they started the whole thing  the unfairness of the democrats traitors that they are ,no officer lic under any state knows better not to grab your weapon and point or shoot unless the attack is life threatening with a weapon in which they did not have nor the victim metropolitan officer who shot her was in the wrong and should be in prison
I have seen more cops for black person traffic stop violation then it was at the capitol Riot .
Stop the steal....lol
Funny how the mainstream media labels peaceful protestors “thugs” and “a threat to democracy”, but violent domestic terrorists storming the Nation’s Capitol get downgraded to protestors. Make that make sense.   ​@​
4 is nothing, what about all those people who died during PEACEFUL protests
Trump cultists making sacrifices in the name of Trump now
Should be wearing a mask spitting on that mic an all .. ya know
2021 wish everything the best
Imagine if they had just a few guns! They could have killed hundreds!
Is it time to prosecut, Republican members of Congress and Senator Cruz,have incited a domestic terror attack and attempts to overturn the election must face consequences.
Congress Ran Like the Roaches that They Are
When the cops are more friendly with terrorists than with pacific protestors.... USA.
Yay, do it again. Great job.
Am I the only one who thinks that the man doing the sign language is funny af?
Calling HK protesters that breach HK's Legislative Council "heroes of democracy" , "a sight to behold" (0 deaths) , yet when protesters in US breach the US capitol, they were labelled "rioters, mobs, extremists", calling them a "disgrace" (with 4 deaths already). The irony...
If it was a persons of Colour there would be riots all over the country but it’s a white man or woman nothing gets done this is state of America at the moment remember they were unarmed
Yall think BLM could’ve got that far?
Is jay pharaoh doing a sink skit in the corner?
0:27 mic drop x'D
THEY MOST HAVE BEEN BLM INFILTRATORS IN WHITE MASK
The 2021 America🤔
why should President Trump be removed from office because of a few people who decided to take matters into their own hands.  Can you not see that it is as much the governments fault as it is the peoples fault.  President Trump doesn't support rioting.  He has stood up to the rioters in other states which the democrats are supposed to be the ones in control.  This all started because the democrats have lost control of the states ,  They have put money before the people and the money is going into their pockets instead of the peoples.  The people need help. This is why the people are getting angry at their government.  The government doesn't mind sending our money to foreign countries but they will not release it to the people it belongs to.  This is my feelings.  I really don't know how most people feel.  I'm not able to get out to support or to riot .  At this point, I am just here praying that our nation will come to God for their help.  We all need forgiveness  of our sins and we need our government to lead the way.
Electoral fraud has revealed that the levers of democracy in the United States are rotten, that institutions and courts do not exist. The deep state that has now come to power by fraud has been producing and financing much greater violence, bloodshed and rebellion against legitimate authorities around the world for decades
So, a good guy with a gun shot a domestic terrorist.  Got it !
i hope all power will goes to china. USA is fallen
This does not represent real Americans,  these are extremists. All extremists from both sides do not represent real Americans.
2nd viewing I watched the interpreter. I could understand him and I don't know sign language. He be good.
America, Trump encouraged his supporters to commit an act of terrorism against America's Capitol, that's treason. America, we need to demand that Trump is arrested now.
Protest/Riot happens globally!??? This is NOT something NEW to USA compare to daily gun crimes at high level!?
There was more police presence/force at Breonna Taylor’s home 🤦🏾‍♂️
shame
Tracy mccgrady is a sing language translator now? Didn’t see that
I never meant for this bs to happen. All this time, and all we’ve achieved is a black interpreter.
Ha ha ha  this  is Amerika?
this of the first we the people will not be played with by this tyrannical government anymore
And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Votes were stolen!
So bad
To all my fellow Trump supporters and Infowarriors, I condemn the actions taken yesterday for we had become no better then ANTIFA. I for one moved on from this fiasco but now... Why to make things worse for us all. Those in the capitol you have brought shame to us all.
The only time in life I wanted to be a police officer. I would've been mowing them confederates down.
Did the TRUMP Capital Police take selfies with the deceased???
I Dont care . No Justice No Peace .  I was hoping it was burnt down . Commies and Traitors. Dirty Dems .
1 unarmed female shot and killed. 3 dead from Medical Emergencies. That's the headline.
Well most of us looking from afar (though a U.S. Citizen) knew Trump was a dangerous lunatic, now we know him to be a seditious dangerous lunatic. The buck stops with him...he incited this insurrection and if course told his idiot supporters that he'd be right there with them and coward that he is as usual  was a no show....only tweeting away in his safe space. He's a pathetic infantile Twitter addicted incompetent bullying Loser whi innate narcissism prevents him from accepting the fact that he LOST the election. He deserves nothing but to be held to account for inciting sedition.
RIP U.S. RIP
We're off to a great start in 2021
All the police leaders should be fired for incompetence. All police found in selfies with these terrorist should be charged and imprisoned
Police open door for Antifa go inside. All set up by radical & Rhinos. Mike Pence is traitor at beginning .
I'm not shock anymore
Anyway, that sign language interpreter is very cute
feels like the sign language interpreter was trolling them
Free Hong Kong! No wait, this is USA
Good job officers but do your job start  arresting people
I’ll be here with my popcorn watching the Civil War unfold.
The people were waved in by the police. Plus the police killed the woman who was not armed.  The bombs were probably pre planned by someone within the goverment and involved with antifia members to make Trump supporters look like they had done all this. Again capital police are the same ones that excuted Miriam Carey shooting her car over twenty times with her little girl in the back seat. The family is suing the several police departments involved in her excution. They need to pay the family for their loss.
4 people lost their lives, is the tragedy 😢 and NOT necessary.  My prayers go out to their families 🙏  we should not lose our lives because we protest. Is this China? As for the police officers injured, I hope they recover quickly. And it does not arouse hatred in their souls. RECOUNT THE BALLETS BOYS
Police shot and killed unarmed protestors. Aren't you just so darn proud of yourselves?  Did you sleep well last night knowing you murdered a woman with just 1 kill shot from your taxpayer funded service revolver?
Have they arrested that officer bet she was black they would have ..
Hong Kong police is great.
Of Course The Cops Had To Murder An Attractive White Unarmed Woman To Make The Event Official Guessing  It Was A Black Capitol Cop. Guessing Theres Gonna Br More Blowback On Camela And Sleepy Joe....💩💩💩
Call of duty: America invades America ahahahahah. What a shame! You voted Trump 4 years ago, this is the result
pipe bombs that didn't go off....mmmmmm i wonder why?
Karma is catching up to America.......destroying countries and hundreds of coup attempts..you are creating your own little monsters at home..........this is just the begging... Trump...bush....planted the seeds of hatred and destruction..........ferguson.... minneapolis....us election..... that was trump......bush destroying iraq...and the middle east.......karma is going to catch up one day to you guys....arrogance doesn't let you see.
170,000 homeless in California and not one penny in those 5,000 pages about helping them.They can send billions to help other countries while our citizens starve because of lobbyists.The people are fed up!!!!
America hurt itself in confusion
"Four of those arrested were charged with carrying a pistol without a license, possession of a large capacity ammunition feeding device, possession of unregistered ammunition, according to DC Police."
Yes and Antifa has since admitted that the pipe bombs belonged to them. Not trump worriors.
Everyone that died deserved it...as trump said ....stupid decision win stupid prizes
Traitorous police murdered an unarmed woman.
Sorry to hear that god blessed there souls
Brought to you by Mr. Peckle Sheddlers
Tiny hats. Big lies.
A flag and a mobile phone  and bit of pushing is not a riot    squirming to find a reason for a violent response. Only shot fired came from his side
Trump for President, yes yes bla bla bla
Four (4) dead after trump incites riot on his attempted Coup at U.S. Capitol...  So my question; If I incited a riot let along a Coup to over take the U.S. Capitol and four (4) people died, would I not be charged with accessory to murder?
wow, that's the most beautiful scenery. Bravo.
Only shot fired from uniformed thugs
I'm just making a statement, pro Trump's spend their time denying everything and seeing conspiracies everywhere and all the time and whatever the subject.
Next 4 years are going to be tough for President Biden. He has to balance between Republicans and Democrats. Trump on twitter will continue to question Biden Administration. Any stark withdrawal from Trumpism will attract massive protests if not violence. We Indians never expected that we will witness such an event in a robust democracy like USA.
AAAARGHHHHH DONT TREAD ON ME!!!  secret service: haha pistol go brrrrrr
But why is R&B singer Marques Houston  doing the sign language tho sign  🤟🏿 👏🏿😂
Antifa
Identify rioters, arrest, and charge with treason.
1-if they were black.... no cop would allow them to get in.. they would be killed 2- how the Capitol is not secure??!! 3-Some countries. Are so proud of Trump and his supporters... this is exactly what they want AND they don’t have to do ANYTHING!!
Om Shanti!
Now the USA will have their IRAQ!
The simpsons anyone ?
Trump was a better president anyway
4 UNARMED- SHOT AND KILLED BY COPS ( N.B. They didn't just 'die' ).
Republicans are the worst group of people in our time.
Libya should invade America and liberate these poor souls
How dare you open fire on the people call martial law trump now.
You deserve to go down for the way you sold out america and allowed your police to kill our people down with the police down with the government we will not take this and stand by idoly
Just let us in next time
Danat P.S.ok 💞 Disney
I have never seen so many obese people fighting !
Oh boy time to see the comments
Be careful kids. DO NOT protest for freedom. If you want to stay safe, you can always loot and burn down little businesses. No police will ever shoot or arrest you.
LMAO that signer got me laughing
This is what you wanted for Iran now it happened to you .
Do NOT ever let RUSSIANS into your internal politics! Never ever! Otherwise you'll get THAT!!!
Her Blood is on Trumps hands.
These guys are mall cops?
You break into the Capital, you get shot. It's a pretty simple concept.
My guy having a silent rap battle and I’m here for it
There was no threat and no reason to justify shooting an unarmed woman. Two police in riot gear were 3 feet from her. They could have grabbed her and pulled her down from the door. She died due to poor decisions on her part and bad judgement on the under cover cop shooting into a crowded room.

🇺🇸 - Trump 🇮🇳 - Modi
What the United States often does in other countries has finally tasted for itself.
Ok but WHAT killed the other three?
In 50 years Trump's Presidency will be viewed as the most corrupt 'ever'!
Your a liar , there isn’t any police officer injured, just another lie from the mob,
Now that democrats are going to be in power watch the whole "DEFUND THE POLICE" Disappear they are hypocrites.
How many police officers were killed this year? Because the anarchy that was going on in this country. How many cops were assaulted this year by so called peaceful Antifa and BLM protesters, and  How many innocent Americans were attacked, while in her vehicles. But did anybody come out, did Joe Biden get on the news and ask people to stop destroying, looting rioting and destroying peoples livelihoods burning their business is down, small businesses and these were people of every color and creed. He’ll never recover from what has happened in 2020. No Joe never condemned what was going on in the country for months and months and months. So now the other side got a little taste of what’s coming, and use don’t like it. Well that’s Karma. There’s a lot of pissed off Americans who are sick of taking the bullshit.
1776!
The ones who died were they his supporters? Well done
Law and Order President my ass.
He look like he's doing, *Spoken Word!* 👄
America slowly become third world country
Don't give up. Trump for president. Greetings from Poland
If they were democratic they would've been allowed to burn the Capitol down
ANTIFA
America is willing to fight socialism. Put it away.
In other words they killed 4 peaceful protesters and planted evidence to justify it in the name of the Chinese Communist party and Russian sex trafficking
Nancy Patricia Pelosi : a beautiful sight to behold.
Only modi can save America now😁
3 bombs he tried to kill all yall
Pence is responsible for 4 deaths and the reps are responsible for allowing a foreign entity to take over our country
You guys cause that the officers getting hurt you told him to not take no guns to protect themselves but yet still when are the groups protest march down in DC they have to take guns a.k.a. rifles shotguns what not but a violence march do not post to take guns really
Bullshit. The police helped them enter...
All corrupt & God will send Wrath to all !🙏✝️❄️🌊🔥☃️🦠💦🌋☄️🧟‍♂️🌬☔️🧟‍♀️💥🤴🤙♾♌️🤙😇
They are gonna just get away with gunning down an unarmed airforce veteran of this country? Disgusting, why you crooked coward police officers gunning down unarmed women now? This officer who shot this woman needs to get the death penalty. This is ridiculous how much of a joke of a man you must be to mow down an unarmed woman. Spineless worm.
4 dead or 4 killed. All US media is told not to use the world killed.  !!!
These people are idiots! What an embarrassment for the U.S.
It’s the interpreter for me 🥴😩❤️😂
next step is burn the city.
Weak Police lines - getting injured as armed defence force is part of the job - man up you bullies; you do that usually
im chinese and i agree with Trump, he is a good chairman, i mean, he dont fight for some army company, he only fight for usa
Trump incited the riot and is solely responsible for the deaths of 4 individuals that were fueled by blind faith and lies.
Yo that deaf translator fresh 💯
The United States should attack the United States to stop the tyrannical rule in the United States!
Are you telling me a police officer killed Ashley Babbitt????????????
trump and his minions are out of control. smh.
sign guy looks like hes rapping
Soo this what 750 billion dollars get you 🤔👀
but then when it was blm?
That sign language dude 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You wouldn't shoot BLM or ANTIFA. You shot that woman through a door. She was not doing anything. Those pipe bombs are from ANTIFA. Why would Patriots bomb the RNC? Molotov cocktails are the stuff of ANTIFA.
The end of freedom speech will start soon when all global platform like this will completely control the "proper rethoric" of "truth". Trump is a desperate clown - a gift for democrats , for globalists which want similiar things as in China - global control and citizen evaluation system. It's already happening but situation like this one will be one of excuse for stronger censorship to "avoid spread of hate speech". In result we all around the world will be living in illusion of a "perfect smily man" smiling like a Joker with crying soul. It's a funny that most democrats and left wings  voters around the world indentify with riots from Joker condemn this situation. If Trump could win elections I'm sure that will be similar riots from democrats side and that will be "fight for democracy" - most media will spread such headlines. Most of protesters are unfortunatelly "retarded twats" uneducated comparing mouthy left wings experts educated on studies of "flying on a broomstick" - one group of "loosers" must serve, must be pacified by this "inteligence" dodger because first group can do practical things - real things for this left wing loafers which are very intense busy for "spreading love and tolerance". Nice to live an illusion that such economic rhetoric will remain forever.
Biden es un asesino! Deep State kill innocent people!
Can anyone tell reason behind this riots
Please PRESIDENT BIDEN make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN MAKE 👏👏🇺🇸🇺🇸🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️👏👏🇺🇸🇺🇸
Is it really good to have bloody conflict like this? I don’t believe in such a big and democratic America, why can’t there be two presidents?😠😡👿
Pipe bombs?? Oh yeah that's not a riot all.. 🤦🏼‍♂️
I see Trump getting arrested soon 😂
HOMELAND MOVIE ????
Zzzzzzzz 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Россия вперёд
❗️LATEST NEWS: The USA invaded the USA to export democracy.
For decades, the war has been waged for a long time, and countless people have been destroyed. Today, the Celestial cycle, retribution is coming.
Its odd -- BLM and Antifa destroying cities and Monuments for Months around the Nation and the National Guard was never called out -- Why Not???
It’s only 6 days into 2021
who ordered the security to shoot the unarmed woman, a honored veteran? our veteran didn't die in a battlefield, but was killed by police in people's house.
Ohhh no....Nevermind, how many u had killed innocent people in Iraq..  what u gave, u get back
There was alack of security because they agreed with the crowd. no one there was threating anything. scared police and security officers were the problem. the people that brought pipe booms and a long gun I can guarantee were not part of the protest. they were just radical dumb asses that wanted to start trouble no matter what the protest was about. they don't reflect the vast majority of the people that were there. Shame on pence for not standing up for this country. With out a doubt the Dems are going to wreck this country. As far as the people that were killed there more it a shame. over reaction on the part of the officers. more people get hurt hurt at a rock concert.
the top national security knows this will happen, and not providing enough personnel. after the riots... then... they come, just like concert worker cleaning up stage after the show finish.
THEY DIDN'T 'FORCE ENTRY', THOSE POLICE OFFICERS OPENED THE GATES TO ALLOW THEM INSIDE THE BUILDING!  IT'S ALL ON VIDEO! Arrest those officers!
This niqqa doing gangsings ayyy
So the officer who shot and killed an unarmed citizen is being charged with murder? Oops, nope that only happens when they kill a career criminal!
I am anti Trump...but anti shooting his supporters.  In other words, I have a balanced view.
This is just sad. It just goes to show what mess Trump put us through is the same or similar mess when he leaves office.
NWO exposing itself
stupidy is also aform of evolution
That’s the flyest sign language interpreter I’ve ever seen
Yall FAILED Miserably, It should not Matter The Race but to Yall, It Did  , YALL LET THEM IN, BLACKS SAW THIS A MILE AWAY--- SHE DIED a domestic TERRORIST, FOR NOTHING
This would’ve been different if Kanye won💯
Thought Blue lives mattered Mr Trump?
I am from india..I can tell you now a cocktail of democrats , Islamists and communists have taken over america ..it's good for the world ..America is no more a super power..the white supremacy is going to end..😀😀😀😀
The LACK of security is terrifying. I've seen more cops deployed to break up a bar room brawl.
Hahaha wait wait wait.... all of a sudden y’all care about the injured cops? Lol 😂 wow fucken crazy
Dum-as Bowser started putting a curfew on Pro-Trump activist preventing free speech.
That wasn’t a riot, nothing was burned to the ground like Antifa and BLM does.
War is comming..
This is a human rights violation
The shot heard around the world
Sickening
Your officers let them in. Talk about it.
Abki Baar Trump Sarkar 🔥
"confessed" in their comments that they saw the "chaos in the US" as revenge. After inciting so much chaos around the world under the pretext of "freedom and democracy," the US finally tasted the "karma" of its double standards.
"Pelosi can enjoy the beautiful sight - even at her office desk! For such a long time, US politicians called rioters 'freedom fighters' in other countries. Now, they finally have retribution!"
Biden fim da liberdade Americana!
Support the independence of both sides of the United States!! This kind of politics can shamelessly comment on the democracy and human rights of other countries?   U.S. aggression intervenes in the affairs of other countries and Hong Kong! Now look at yourself more should be invaded and interfered!! What a terrible low-level place!
ANTIFA 👎👎👎
Is Trump worth enough....to die for
Funny. Antifa gets away with outrageous behavior and never a club is raised or a cuff placed. But 4 Patriots were shot and killed? I don't understand. Seems like a two way street here!
Who else was watching the guy doing sign language?
All should be arrested
They were told to 'Stand by ' before. 🤔
But they didn't burn any cities or loot store after store store. And Trump DID tell everyone to go home.
LET'S RİOT BİTCHES !!!!
Trailers launch 2021
*Career politicans such as Cory Booker, AOC, Duckworth, and Pelosi looked the other way while Antifa rioted and hid while a female Trump supporter was murdered*
All on delusional deplorable Trump Toxic
After what happened today any armed Trump supporter should be shot on site
I heard that joe bidon is fraud... He is behind all of this.
2020: I'm the worst year for a century 2021:Hold my Molotov cocktail
First ban gun
Wow russia invaded the US without guns. US is showing weakness letting these idiots in. Declare martial law Joe Biden
Hmm you never hear about injured officers at blm protests
Can we say "antifa"? Pipe b***b smells like ANTIFA to me.
No more police in capitol doors wide  open
only 4? those are rookie numbers
Hongkong rioters used sharp weapons , hammers and even cocktail bombs a against the police and ordinary citizens on a regular basis for one yr.Miraculously , only one old man was killed by a rioters’ brick. US has a minor riot in a day and already 4 ppl were killed. That show how useless the law enforcement force US is! RIP to those 4 ppl.

You call this Riots?  This was mostly peaceful demonstration  Yes some idiots are always around. The n every crowd  By comparison..-> BLM/ANTIFA “mostly peaceful” Went on for weeks and months Molotovs, car burning, police clashes, buildings burned down to the ground, shootings, looting. , need I say more?
Making American great again!
The Capitol hill police that killed  is a hero
Putin laughing at braindead Trumpsters. Thanks traitors!
Why is that dude below dancing?
Many of the people have been ID as Antfia
Biden's storm troopers murdered four peaceful American patriots for simply visiting the US Capitol. 🇺🇸🕊️
Blm 🔥 down cities and loots but that didn't matter rite smh the extreme democratic party omg what more can you say stolen election I'll be shocked if the US 🇺🇸  will stand after this administration gets done usa the new China Americans last take ❤ care of other countries first that's our new policy 🙄
These people should be fired due to lack of proper security and for not acting on knowledge this would happen. Four people died and for lack of security insurgents entered the Capitol and vandalized, damaged federal property. The DC cops inside were taking selfies with them and removed barricades for them to enter.
Riot vs peaceful protest. MSM thinks they get to choose the classification on feelings not facts. MSM is the enemy of the people.
And who's been arrested?
I lived in D.C. for 9 years and attended hearings in the Longworth House Office Building.  Peaceful protestors do not carry loaded guns into the Capitol Building nor do they plant pipe bombs outside the Longworth building and the Republican Party offices.
Riots..Really!? That shit hole of a district was in flames over the summer. We’re all being played and divided. Great reporting👎🏻
Antifa members posing as Trump supporters have been identified!  The same men in black at Antifa rallies with identifying tattoos of Communist sickle and hammers positively identified them.  These antifa members pushed a woman in front of police who were aiming their guns at them, and she was shot in the neck.  Witnesses said Antifa was already in the Capitol waiting when some Trump supporters walked in.  Antifa started breaking glass and Trump supporters tried to remove them from the building.  ANTIFA MURDERED THE WOMAN AND DAMAGED PROPERTY!  AND THE DEMOCRATS KNEW ABOUT IT because NEARLY ALL OF THEM HAD SPEECHES WRITTEN AND MEMORIZES ABOUT IT WHICH THEY READ WHEN OBJECTING TO THE CHALLENGE TO AUDIT!  HOW COLD THEY HAVE HAD TIME. TO WRITE AND MEMORIZE SPEECHES UNLESS THEY KNEW ANTIFA WAS THERE?!
Sign language guy👌🏾👌🏾🤌🏾
Trump cultist for ya. Blue lives only matter when black lives don’t. Blue lives don’t matter during happy hour when it’s ok to run police over, or when the attack the Capitol. More domestic terrorism. We warned ya about these “patriots”
ANTIFA
I know something about LAW ENFORCEMENT CLAIMS of injuries sustained...THEY ALWAYS MAKE IT OUT TO BE BIGGER THAN APPLE PIE. (bogus)!!!
What did they expect,It's payback time. The crooked Democraps started this 4 years ago ..
Prayed for our officers 🙏
Arrest trump his fault
An officer shot an an unarmed female veteran, think about that.
That's all? Is Trump included?
This brother doing the signage got some swag, let's be honest.
They were antifa there's actually a photo of them with the antifa association name at the bottom of the picture
If the United States saw what the United States is doing in the United States, the United States would invade the United States to liberate the United States from the tyranny of the United States.      -Mohamad Safa
I hope all 4 were maga maggots
It was Antifa I have the video
It is a beautiful sight to behold
Now that blood has been offered as a atonement, you protesters are sealed as the church assembly of Satan. Enjoy to the last.
Wow keep these things coming throughout the year...
🤪🤪🤪
My question is why there was so few officers with that many protesters. Come on.... anyone with two brain cells should have thought that was a bad idea. The extreme trumpers have been talking a civil war since he lost the election, there should have been more precautions in place for this. Trump his son and Rudy Giuliani should be brought up on charges inciting a riot that has cause one woman to lose her life (on her own stupidity yes but still) and that caused the injuries to the officers. Its sickening how little they don't except responsibility for his actions first with covid and now this. I cant wait for one of two things to happen. His cabinet invokes the 25th ammendment or when Biden takes office because this a disgrace to our nation, its people and now our democracy.
People should start trashing trump properties. Sending trump to bankruptcy
Um ... pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails. Multiple dead. Who knows what else they didn’t find. Keep saying the other side is worse or the same in comparison. I have no respect for those that support this. It’s disgusting and terrorism. Welcome 2021. I hope we can unify and come back from this. Utterly heartbreaking.
They are peaceful protesters. Ted Cruz supports riotors in other countries. Pelosi called the large demonstrations “a beautiful sight to behold” before.
BLaMe BLaMe people are dead
Trump never made America Great Note: I am not from America. It's my opinion.
But if it was us‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Antifa was bussed I’m with police escort
Sounds just like ANTIFA’s Modus operandi. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Peace on earth 🌎  is a  long lost cause  violence doesn't solve the problems   talking about it and debating the evidence and proof  will give answers we the people are seeking  all we ask is a forensic odit
Remember the days when getting on one knee was considered disrespectful to America?
It was Antifa acting like Trump  supporters set up again  on American people
Praying for our Country.🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
The people dosen't want socialism
Where is the Hong Kong rioters ? Come to shout 5 demands!
UK, Canada, France betrayed US people😤 The mainstream media in the United States manipulates the direction of speech and suppresses dissenting information. It is obvious that there is a powerful network behind it to control the whole American politics and media. It is not allowed for those who support justice to speak out, which accounts for about half of the American population. The United States suppresses freedom of speech. The top minority of rich, powerful and politicians in the United States manipulate elections, kill dissenting citizens, and steal national purchasing power by increasing the money supply without ceiling☠
No officers dead? Wow!
meanwhile the orange buffoon is still fighting for the chair in the White House!
That's very sad to the people who lost their lives my heart goes out to all of your loved ones it is not fair that you should have died over 2 guys who have been battling for power there is never power when innocence is lost may God bless you R.I.P Amen
Trump gov has failed again... 💩
The people of this country earned the right to freedom by governing their own behavior. If people can't behave in a manner befitting the status of free citizens, then they forfeit freedom not only for themselves, but for the entire nation. Only by adhering the the unwritten laws of society do the laws remain unwritten. Actions like these are how you enter a dictatorship. When people create uprisings because their personal feelings differ from the direction of the country, you give rise to dictators.  In a dictatorship, MANY people are very, very happy. That's how they happen in the first place. They make a small group of powerful people very happy. These protestors are attempting to replace democracy with dictatorship by putting their own desires above the people of this country as a whole.   That is how Adolf Hitler came to power. If you ignore facts, and allow ignorance and bias to guide your actions, you inevitably lead the country to destruction. I don't say 'will lead', because that implies this is some future hypothetical. I am not speaking about hypotheticals.  This has happened countless times in history. It continues to happen today all around the world. Open your eyes and understand that you live in REALITY, and no amount of fighting will allow you remake it. The world is a real thing, and no matter what you might believe can not change the things that are simply fact.
"It is what it is."
Very nice 😍💋 💝💖♥️❤️
All hail president trump right? Lmfao
Today, in history, people died of natural causes in a riot.
RICO ACT.
#45 has a Faustian deal with the Devil! I fear he will NEVER be punished for his myriad & heinous crimes!
When you are trying to reach Mars but shot death trying to reach window ☯️....pray Lord Shiva 🕉️to balance the Cosmo's
What...Don’t blame Trump. The Antifa is paid to riot, destroy & kill paid for by the Dem Party/Soros. Truth
It is the leftist globalist rats infiltrated in the protest
covid 19 and  loser trump are two faces of the same quagmire we live these days. May God Help us get through these coming days safely.
One officer suffered a hand injury while opening the gates to let in the rioters. Another had temporarily obscured eyesight from the flash of the selfie he took with the rioters.
BLM huh?
You bestvlook at vidio it look like the police were welcoming the terrorist innot all but it look suspicious
The biggest loser Trumpet must be removed immediately by Congress. His immunity expires on Jan 20, and he may flee the country.
Trump has no blame it's called freedom.
Catch All Antifa and communism Group first
Yes he needs to be charged he was pardoning everyone from jail .. now he thinks that he is someone that what he says will go .. now look he doesn’t care at all .. now people have died it’s so sad 😞 he is a monster 👺
The people that were involved need to be prosecuted too,as well as Trump.🇨🇦
2021....!!!! Trump has blood on his hands.
OMG
2021......already questionable year
Trump needs to be charged this was all his fault
How many others have suffered looting and riots elsewhere this year. This is like reporting covid counts but not the flu.
Trump needs to be prosecuted
Smh wats wrong with ppl
