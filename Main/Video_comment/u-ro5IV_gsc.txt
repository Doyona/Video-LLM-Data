As soon as I saw the grapefruits I had to actually pause the video in anticipation for garrets song
God i love garrett so much rewatching his videos is a therapy to me ❤❤❤❤
haahahaha why are the froot loops in the fridge!?
I come back to this video more often then I'd like to admit, just to hear grapefruits are green in august
I would love to see the video of Garrett and Andrew during their time together during quarantine 😂
Hii I'm from 4 1/2 years in the future and everything is definitely more 👽 than ever
My mom is your videos
I hope you make another one of these for this year.
imagine him abd a partner with all ths energy , he is just not doing all these hype things for himself only , but for a partner too , it will be PERFECT!!!!
waking up at 11:30 is an accomplishment to me too
Andrew literally filming Garrett the whole entire video and then texts Garrett at 12AM to come over 😂😂😂😂 Not slick at all Garrett
I'm new to this channel but I have a question. Garrett gives me Adhd vibes. Very much so. Does he have it, because YAY ME TOO
where did you get that cd player
I literally love garrett watts I feel like if I met him inperson we would be inseparable like the Weasley twins 😛
ANDREW IN THE TWENTY ONE PILOTS SHIRT 5:54
Did I see the Aum sign @19:07. Garrett you are so random and unique and I love it 😃👏🐈👌
I'm glad you also eat cake with chopsticks
@GarretWatts I don’t know if you’ll ever see this, but please don’t stop being yourself. You and Andrew are the kindest, purest, funniest, and innocent souls on this planet! You guys make my day every time I watch your videos! Every time I watch them, I laugh and smile and relate to most of the things you do and say. Love you guys, and please don’t stop being yourselves💜
andrew is so hot
i love u
Does anyone else feel cheated that they didn’t show off the toppings on the pizza?
Okay but low-key I would watch thousands of hours of you two hanging out. On a roof or on the ground, whichever
I absolutely adore and Andrew and Garrett's friendship... They are so freaking hilarious I'm laughing till my tummy is sore!!!!!! I love you guys... HUGE SUPPORTER ALYSSA ❤❤😂😂😂😂😂
I still don’t believe you are gay, you are toooooo cute . Oh and I love Harry Potter 🫶🏽🥹
Only Garrett can make a 40 min day in my life video
My family did 80 days of themed dinners
I love Garrett
Absolutely love the imagery of Garret waking up some mornings and randomly finding Andrew asleep on his couch and not questioning it at all
Time STILL feels weird 3 years later. Whoops.
This is literally therapy for me
Garrett gives me Bo Burnham vibes 🤣🤣
OH MY GOSH YOU HAVE A VASH FIGURINE!!! 19:00
You suddenly became a mezzosoprano (? XD
you should make more merch garrett
32:19 its giving Bo Burnham's Inside.
guys i think garrett has adhd
2 years later and I still need a “night in my life” video, babe.
it is currently 2023, and i am still recovering from 2020 AND covid. i haven’t been the same since 2020.
GARRETT!!!!!!
I’ve had a shit day and rewatching Garrett’s vids and oh my god I it cured all of my problems
ive wanted to go on a date with andrew since forever
I actually sleep with swords next to my bed tbh 😂 before the swords it was some other weapon ⚔️ Wearing glasses 👓 and having a fear of intruders in the dark 👻 and not being able to reach my glasses but somehow able to reach my swords quicker (which are both about the same reach distance) gives me some sort of comfort 🤣
Favorite Lana Del Rey song? random thought: i think we will definitely be best friends in our next lifetimes 😂🤍
Love you guys
Andrew and Garrett are straight-up Grey Gardens and I. AM. LOVING. IT.
Andrew is such a babe. Carry on.
I love you Garrett!
I spent most of quarantine getting stoned lol
when andrew and garrett were on the roof and he made it a horror movie omg i was cackling!!
I love how a perfectly normal stock photo lady has evolved into a complete alter ego
Garrett should release the “Grapefruits Are Green” song on Spotify and all music platforms. I’d buy it ❤☺️
Garrett, the cutest mess ever. I need to adopt him ❤️ I have lots of Dr Who and Harry Potter stuff Garrett….and yeah and also two sons’ of my own…..but you’d be my favourite! 😊 x
Andrew's laugh cracks me UP!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Why is garret a surprisingly great singer
garrett misspelling crochet is so funny💀
Love your day🤠🙂🙂🙂🙂
3:33 is literally the most relatable content I've ever seen in a Youtube video.
I wish I could give this video another like each time I watch it.
I know I'm about 2 years too late but I'd love to quarantine vibe with these guys and would LOVE to find Andrew waking up on my couch like that ;)
omg I used to tell people to look at the light when they needed to sneeze and I never knew why it never worked for other people
Garrett has a manager?  I also have ADHD and I know exactly what he was feeling in regards to the lockdown.  It was so hard for me to concentrate on any thing productive because there just didn't seem to be any point.  And like a lot of people I turned to YT to keep me entertained.  Plus buying a lot of DVDs (I don't have a tv).  Very confusing time in general but probably a lot more for people in our position/situation.  It feels as though you're going stir crazy 24/7/365 and your brain feels constantly fried.  Even when asleep.  If that is possible at all.  I saw so much of me in this video but the only difference is I was doing it on my own.  I wish I had an Andrew Siwicki.
still waiting for the garrett and andrew in washington saga 🤞
I also sneeze when i go into the sunlight.  I remedy this by wearing photo grey lenses in my glasses.  Cheers
I ALWAYS SNEEZE AT THE SUN AND NEVER KNEW WHY THANK YOU
Can you send me a free Andrew?
its all good i sleep with or use to sleep with a 9mm (hand gun) ......... So.... YEAH!!!! lol ROCK THAT  SWORD!! YEAHH BOI!!! LMFAO!!
my favorite thing about this moment 6:38 is that that is a very normal thing that squirrels do ! they'll lay their little bodies flat on something to give it their bodies heat in the most effective way possible ! just a cute squirrel fact :))
Do a night in your life!  Would be fantastic!  You are so fun to watch! ;^)
20:35 that's the crazy stare i appreciate.
Psr, i have too.
i’m rewatching this video and i’m smiling so hard, i love garrett and andrew’s friendship they’re so cute <3
D
Grapefruits ARE green in August, thanks Garret. <3
Is it garrett or my adhd?
Garret is the best accident ever
Need a ghost like that OMG
Garrett’s singing gives me Keith from Try Guys in the crocheting video vibes😂😂
I can always rewatch a garret watts video
We still need a "night in my life" from Garrett lol
Garrett and Andrew are both so handsome and effortlessly and authentically adorable 😍
Garrett makes me so comfortable in myself w/out even trying.
Easily my favorite video on the entire internet.
“can we go inside?” “🎶 yes 🎶”
I found myself singing " grapefruits are green in August " at the grocery store.
i swear they’re just like brothers 🤣 andrew says no i don’t want to and so garrett tells him no i haven’t even told you the grand surprise 😂😂
i love how they were texting about how he woke up at 3pm at 12;20 am
If ADHD was a video
wait
Rewatching again, as I patiently await the haunted makeup studio video.  Andrew and Garrett remain one of the few bright spots from quarantine.  Love their relationship.
29:21 I’ve been laughing at this small little interaction for the past 5 minutes
Was that a Kiki cake, like from kikis Delivery service?
27:33 they are platonic husband's ur honor its been confirmed.
13:22 Garret is a treasure
Garrett is a golden retriever change my mind
OMG GARRET! I _also_ sleep with a pregnancy pillow! My mom got one for my little sister with autism, and it was so great, that she also got me one (I have ADD). It is the BEST thing ever.  Just give me my pregnancy pillow, my weighted blanket and my memory foam pillow, (and my sleep aid) and I am sound asleep like a little baby 👶
during quarantine, I believe I felt like I was losing all my marbles. What kept me sane was journaling, walking my dog, doing yoga, and calling my bestie when I got COVID even though I felt like dying xD we've all been there!! you're not alone!
ok but at like 17:00 or whatever there's that little "beep, beep" they put there for the pause and I legit thought a ghost just whistled at me in my room lol
My birthday is also on the 7th
mmm milk and whiskey
did you hear a spider?! killed me
16:15 its a POPtub!
I love that Andrew and Garrett are still buddies. Haven’t seen Garrett’s vids in a while and I’m so pleasantly surprised
the broom before it died
I watch this video so so so so often
Love the Grapefruit song hahahaha
I just stare at the sun just to sneeze sometimes
Garrett I have pot baby twin
26:37 lol
garret and Andrew are platonic soulmates and you cant tell me otherwise
This is a true depiction of hypermania.  Garrett I bet you are exhausted by the end of the day.
For over two weeks the grapefruits are green was stuck in my head but I didn't quite know how it went...so glad I found it and oh boy it didn't disappoint!!! So good, so funny, can't wait to sing it all the time again😁
How is this video already 2 years old 😮
WE. NEED. MORE.
A go-to comfort video💕
I also sleep with a sword next to me, it's really not that odd don't worry
Garret has the best personality than anyone I know,  I wanna just meet him omgg
so i just learnd why i sneeze just by looking at the light and the sun. Thanks for letting me know!!
Who is that lady with the wine?  She's so mean and seems like an alcoholic.  Is she blackmailing you so she can appear in videos?  Whatever your secret is, you can share it.  We'll still accept you!  It's better than being forced to keep her in your videos.
I've watched this at 20 times. BRING BACK SWEET BOYS!
A pocket skeleton😂😂😂
I still love u even tho u abandoned shane when he needed u most. KEEP going garret. It’s shameful what you did but 🤷🏽‍♀️ can ya do 😂
I swear these two are the literal definition of platonic soulmates 🥺
I have PSR I sneeze whenever I look at the sun
Those plates are actually really pretty. 😍
I am binging his videos😅
But you might not know that grapefruits are green ....in August
Respectfully…. Damn Garrett, legs for dayz dump truck for centuries
this is so funny garret and Andrew 4ever lol
Garrett’s channel is the definition of good vibes
Night in your life! Yes pls
Garrett. I just want to let you know you inspired me to purchase a pregnancy pillow. Its the best decision I've ever made lmao
the grapefruits are green song needs a grammy 👼 you sound like you could easily be an opera singer garrett 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I, too, sleep with a sword. Well, it's a bokken, but basically the same thing.
pocket skeleton
STILL WAITING FOR A NIGHT IN MY LIFE
Here is 2022 and it has not changed at all. time is to wonky
i think the reason i like garrett and his videos so much is bc i relate so heavily to the wonderous view he has on things. it's been something i've hid for so long in an attempt to blend in to the background. but im realizing life is so much better when you love with your whole heart, even if some people think you're weird.
the way garrett throws everything, even a plate to readjust his grip
u should listen to a band called måneskin
bit late but no not microwavable plates. got gold on it. also you have to hand wash, dish washer will wash off the gold and fade the colour
Me watching this in December 2021 thinking back to the century that was 2020 like a fond memory of the decades it has been since 2020, and thinking about how many years 2022 will last...
Wathing Korean Drama and making Brigadeiro (best brazilian chocolate candy ever)
u mean the world to me
Has anyone else felt like they haven't exactly been themselves lately- Lately as in...like... The past 5 years?
You guys are so sweet. I wish there were more people like you in this world.
This guy has some pretty good content. But I can’t stand those ridiculous sandals and I’m glad he’s not wearing a them here.
U guys are my spirit animals
I watch u when I’m overwhelmed with the negative, stupid world.
But did Garrett get to his emails???
Idk why but knowing that Garrett crochets made my whole ass week 🖤 I want to see all of his projects SO bad now!!😩
they boys
Anyone else re watching Garrett and Andrews videos?? I absolutely adore this squad!! Shout out to Shane, Rylan, Morgan and of course, Garrett and Andrew ❤❤❤
this is my safe video
i am now unemployed and the days are melting together
Background sounds during the intro had me buggin lmaooo
Just so you know….don’t microwave fine China…..your microwave will blow up. Also, I wish I had you both as best friends because I am literally Garrett avoiding everything important because….anxiety….and instead learning paper quilling, or crochet, or finding my old gameboy color and playing for hours; while, my adult fiancé yells at me about how I still haven’t called the electric company….or washed dishes in a couple days……I’m just living for it.
we once were excited for the weekend and now the weekend is nothing.
time is weird lately.
Bro I thought I was the only one that sneezed when looking at the sun lmao all my friends tell me it's weird lmao
Please don't mistreat plants. Please take care of your plants.
32:01 is this Bo Burnham’s inside ?
32:00 pov: bo burnhams inside
Is Andrew single? Asking for me
Who the heck disliked this
Hold on a SECOND, chopsticks for cake, huh
Yet again Garrett's videos are the only thing that are able to comfort me during hard times. Thank you so much for being the way you are. Your stuff is so important to me and I hope to see more new stuff soon
This is exactly my method. If I don't make a list of things to do for the day it becomes very disorganized. I am even having to do this for work.
I wanna sleep at your house. I wanna see pot baby .
You're a band aid in my ass You're a piece of work Great insults Garrett 😂😂
Oh my god spoilers mr kakashaka can he even READ CAN HE EVEN READ edit ongoing omgomg of course auntie Danika will help us with this ska album street team they gotta well done 2020 look good enough for the mr bucket well happy blessings but is the bucket a key master too or!?!

okay but i love that garret is trying to crochet, like i don’t think he is like actually doing it but i like the idea that maybe he is trying. i do it so i like the thought
The fact that you sleep with a pregnancy pillow is the most amazing thing ever because both myself and my husband have slept with pregnancy pillows for YEARS! People think we're weird too? But I don't care because it's the most comfortable thing I've ever slept with!!!!! I love you Garrett!
Omg I have a Snoogle too!!! And I'm definitely not nor have I ever been pregnant
After seeing the pocket skeleton I’d love to see you disassemble your washer & dryer to find any little friends you might have lost in the tumble and rinse battle. 🧺
31:30 Garrett Watts: Rooftop the prequel of Bo Burnham: Inside
for the love of creepy baby doll when will he make a music album
Its August 18. This video was posted a whole year ago today.
Omg it’s one year later when I’m watching this for the 19816251197151st time.
Im so happy your channel popped up now i cant stop watching you! Your uniqueness is so refreshing i could see you on main stream TV having your own show!  Blessings from Sydney 🐨
Am I getting Mormon ads  on your videos because of my childhood history, or yours Garrett? 😵‍💫😂
Garrett: *talks about time being distorted in quarentine* Me, realizing it’s been a year since this was uploaded: (“ O_O)
32:19
Who would have thought, a year later, nothing has changed. What a life we live-
Woke up with a stomachache and came here to distract myself and now I feel better.  You two always make me laugh.
I used to think I was allergic to the sun when I sneezed looking at it
I didn’t think I’d find something new about myself today but I do the sneeze thing every time I go out into the sun. I’m not alone!
Garret reminded me of bo burnham when he was playing his piano on the roof :0
Grapefruits are green right now!
I find myself humming "Grapefruits are green in August" at least once a day🙃
Garret looks like wilbur soot like he looks like wil alot
Ever in a bad mood me.. Well here 31:21
garret you have reminded me to brush my teeth
3:03 has big "Wake up at 11:30, feelin' like a bag of shit!~" (Bo Burnham, Shit) vibes XD But in all seriousness, I love this video and your wholesome self. This pandemic has really been taking a toll on my mental health and I'm glad you're so honest in sharing how it affects you and how you're trying to reassure us that what we're feeling is normal <3
Garrett is the personification of my chaotic mind. If there'd be a straight version of him I'd marry him in a heartbeat xD
I JUST BOUGHT THAT PILLOW! I love it, my new favourite thing ♥️
31:42 - is this Bo burnham
I absolutely love garrett and Andrew!!! I love that garrett is just himself
Lowkey Garret angry is attractive
Almost August 2021 and I'm still writing 2020 on paperwork. I don't know where I am
32:02 reminds me of the bo burnham special i’m crying
I have sneeze thing im special
i don’t think i’ve ever smiled for an ENTIRE youtube video. my face is sore
Reality: Andrews been paid by a Psychiatric hospital to film Garrett for their studies
I would love to live with garret 😆
Dude you got to go pick your strawberries
Garrett is a mood
I sleep with my zombie Wacker machete hanging in it's sheath from my headboard. You are not alone.
I have the sneeze thing to it's not that bad except when I go to the flee Market out side and I sneez like the hole time
WE HAVE THE SAME PREGNANCY PILLOW
this video was jus a wholesome vid of soulmates vibin
no one:  Andrew: THERES A LEMON
yoo why is Garrett’s singing voice better than mine 😭😭
I'd love a new one of these from him
Garrett, when will we get the Night in My Life video?? Next year?
I just realized after watching this video multiple times IF ANDREW WASN’T THERE THE WHOLE TIME WHO WAS FILMING THE FIRST PART OF THE VIDEO  ‽
hey garrett :p i love you but your videos gives me major anxiety. (ILY)
🎵 grapefruits are green in auguuuuust 🎶
I’m having a really bad sad anxious day and I needed to come back for the grapefruit song 😂😂 my mood has actually lifted 💜
the whole song bit on the roof really reminds me of bo burnhams inside
"We all gotta be like that squirl" and "socks for sure dont  matter" are gonna be my senior quotes :]
I'm watching this is 2021 relating to the intro then he said 5 months into quarantine and I was like "oh no past garrett"
Garrett, I love you so much, and for whatever's worth, I aspire to have your energy as an adult, surround myself with friends and people like you and Andrew. You are very inspiring. Much love from your fellow gender non-conforming frog enthusiast.
bo burnham who???
I've watched this before but omg I love you so fucking much <3
This my favourite video of him
garrett eats pineapple pizza . . . i knew i could trust him
“There’s a lemon!” -Andrew siwieski 2020
garrett is my comfort human
he makes life interesting.
I nearly cried when I found out the youtuuz was sold out
rewatching this now, i never realized you had a lupin figurine also god bless you and andrew literally being the best things together ever
Lord!  This Day In My Life video could not  be more relatable to living with ADHD hahaha  Hey sweet boy, I know from the podcast that ADHD is something you know about and I mean this comment by no means of diagnosis.  I know You Tubers ham up their personally on camera and I don’t know you personally and I totally respect your privacy. 🌞 Your channel and Sweet Boys just truly bring me so much joy and I love your chaotic, creative hilarious antics xoxo
I randomly sing “grapefruits in August” around my house and no one in my family can figure out what or why I’m singing it 😂
13:22
Garrett.... I'm 40 now😁 Due to certain childhood trauma i still sleep holding something. Don't hide this fact from anyone. It's part of you for a reason. Is does not make u look like a serial killer bro!😂 It actually makes you seem like a cuddly person and to the right person, it will be adorable!😉😜
I’m gay and my fhrase is gay is ok
Did Garrett shower with a watch on???
i would die for a video on their trip to washington
I wish I could find someone exactly like him, but likes girls 💋😊
I’m trained in the Katana and Bow Staff :DD
Omg Garret is so disorganized and dirty 😕
I sneeze at the sun, too
Garret probably has undiagnosed adhd
I go to sleep at 4 am and wake up at 7 am
I identify with pot  baby on a spiritual level.
Are you still friends with Shane, Ryland, Morgan and Andrews?
Pot baby is daddy asf
This was posted a day after my birthday and I’m so glad it was but still really sad that 1 it wasn’t, and 2.. quarantine
Garret: My point is  Me a Sweet Boys fan: Point is alarm
A mortgage is just rent you pay to a bank instead of a landlord. Being grownup is just language sneakiness.
Hey 👋 lol
garrett lowkey gives me keith habersberger from the try guys vibes
Over 9 months and I’m still laughing at the “you’re a bandaid on my ass”
hi i love u
even though this video is very chaotic, it's my comfort video and i watch it nearly everyday:)
I’m dying 😂😂😂  Garrett: ::precariously stacking stools to makeshift a ladder::  Andrew: “Are you kidding me right now? There is LITERALLY no room for error here...and let me just say, that you are not a gymnast.”  😂😂😂
I NEED the video of a night on Garret's life 🤣💛
You thick and you trunk it d
I too have never been with child and stan the fuck out my pregnancy pillow. One of the best things I've ever impulse brought.
hi garrett! this is so random but I just want to thank you for helping me sleep lol I have been struggling these past few days because it has been very hard for me to sleep (because of my anxiety) but you make it a whole lot easier... I just watch your videos and feel comforted. I hope you're doing well!!! <3 ( :
I want tiny Garret
How does Garret make a Ad entertaining
Andrew cuddling with baby yoda
HOW IS HE SINGLE
I can relate to the weird quarantine song tho lol 😂❤
i want an extended version of grapefruits are green in august. if there isn’t, i’m making one. he’s a very good singer, he could be the new sleeping beauty or snow white.
Andrew hugging baby Yoda is holding me together
Garrett watts is the physical embodiment of the song line without a hook
" do you want a milk and vodka" 😂😂😂 lmaooo
Garret and Andrew are the parents we all want
I’m happy I’m not the only one who does the light sneezing thing
garret is literally my Comfort crater
My favorite pastime is: Wasting time watching Garrett waste his time. Good times.
I learned that I have PSR from this video lol 😆
My husband also sneezes when in the sun. He officiated an outdoor wedding a few years and stressed out leading up to it because he was going to be facing the sun during the ceremony. A miracle happened and no sneezing!  He was awesome. Love your content.
I learned how to "crowshay" gets me every time 😂. I also just rewatched the one where he baked a cake for the rat living in the backyard - and in that video Garrett said he doesn't own a microwave "and never will", but he's got one now!! 😁
Garrett has become my pandemic therapy
Omg i have the sneeze thing too but i kinda like it cos it clears your head lol <3
the scary version reminds me of drew :(
WE BOTH HAVE THE ACHOO SYNDROME OMG
His singing is heavenly
If Garret ever makes any clothes for merch he should put " your'e a bandaid on my ass" on a shirt lol
Garrett is just a Disney character irl.
I thought i was the only one who wanted to sneeze while looking at the sun
Garrett, I just have one question. Why did you eat the cake with chopsticks?
✨𝓰𝓻𝓪𝓹𝓮𝓯𝓻𝓾𝓲𝓽𝓼 𝓪𝓻𝓮 𝓰𝓻𝓮𝓮𝓷 𝓲𝓷 𝓪𝓾𝓰𝓾𝓼𝓽✨
Grapefruits are green in august
Honestly the worst ADD I’ve ever seen in my life but I’m living for it
if buy the little drawing
We need some decorations...     *yeets plant over the roof*
GRAPEFRUITS GROW ON TREES? 😭😭❗❓
I started doing guided mediations to help with my anxiety & sleep
I HAVE THOSE SAME PIZZA SOCKS
*trying to figure out if the pillow at **28:54** is a golden girls pillow*
You ever just like find someone else that sneezes cause of the sun and you’re just like “wowie”
I love your crochet baby Yoda 😍
This unedited would be a trip hahah
the plates are not microwavable ... the gold edge isn't microwave friendly
You and Andrew are SO cute.
stan pot baby
I had no idea how beautiful his singing voice was 😍🥺
I sneeze coz of the sun too lol
"thats called inspiring"  and thas exactly how Garret became a Bard  edit 1: and answering , ive been boping to shoujo opening musics of my childhood, been watching anime and started a D&D table with my friends where im a Bard hahaha, our table is pure pure chaos
Garrett: "we're bad guys and we're going to break in and steal your stuff"  Me: Erm I don't think many Burglars announce who they are before entering Garrett...
A NIGHT IN YOUR LIFE PLEASE!
i was just eating an apple, but you made me laugh at 14:46 and now i accidentally spit some apple on the floor 👁👄👁
This is like opening a window in to my mind and what it would look like in physical form.  On the outside I'm just a unmoving potato tho.
Garrett is the person everyone wants to be friends with
Garrett is literally a gay Spencer Ried... i love it lmao
OMFG so glad I'm not the only person with a similarly messed up household (ENFP here)
What I've been doing over quarantine is watching 'attack on titan' it's on hulu and I finished the whole show and I'm very sad, but I recommend it!
Grapefruits are green in August..     Lmao...I cant breathe
this is my comfort video
This is what I live for
14:33 don't mind me..just gonna replay this over and over :3
35:47 i would love to wake up in the morning and look across the road just to see garrett chilling on the roof with his lil newspaper
was that a "cowboy beep bop" mug that i saw? #i'm a anime weeb also #relateable
Garett is so a Gemini
We would be the bestest of friends
The fact that Garret has had Benjamin fir 3 YEARS and still has her is so precious:,)
I've been feeding some stray cats in my neighborhood I didn't know existed until quarantine also a opossum that started coming around a few weeks ago. My life is pretty quiet working from home but I'm ok with it.
Oh, I'm so ready for "a night in my life"
*I'm not throwing everything* 28:54
I'm officially in love with Garrett ❤️
12:27 You could have said "69% sure". I'm disappointed.
"It's almost 3PM so it's time to get dressed for the day" If that ain't me!
Garrett "I wake up at 11:30" *watch shows **9:35*
Garrett, you're not going insane, I feel the same way about it too. JLo and Shakira superbowl doesn't feel like it was in 2020 at all.
Over quarantine I’ve started to write some music
Garret is the cutest. I need to be man and move to America meet him and woo him and treat him like a damn King! 🥰🥰🥰
Garret wasn't an accident, he was a blessing
Honestly I’ve just been watching hunter x hunter in quarantine
i will commit crimes for the ‘Night in my Life’ video
Feel like you need a dog or something, maybe even a squirrel lol
Garrett is so attractive to me idk why     I literally think he is daddy 😭
“That’s not called looking, that’s called inspiring” I can’t 😭
You guys are so sweet🥺🥲
Omg, I love this guy
Why arent they married yet? This is the sweetest thing ever<3
Man I love how excited you are about everything. I just love the vibes! You bring me so much comfort 🥺💕
You and Andrew are such pure souls 🧡
I want to be like Garrett when I grow up even tho im almost 20, when i grow up though
im 14, but i wanna spend a day with this 30 year old so bad
12:22 “accidental existence” turns out, you’re not an accident at all ksksks Thank you parents of Garrett Watts 🥺
What’s the music playing at 28:55
WE NEED A „NIGHT IN MY LIFE“ !
This video was gold. I laughed so hard the last 30 minutes hahahaha. Garrett you are so precious!
as I am watching this I am eating chicken ramen that I heavily seasoned with pepper to burn off my taste buds.
28:10   why does that to with music so much??????
i sleep with a baseball bat so u cool 😂
I appreciate and love the baby yoda amigurumi, and I wanna know if you made it yourself 'cause that's AMAZING!! I make amigurumis too
ANDREW AND I SHARE THE SAME BIRTHDAY
6:41 I’m almost positive that the squirrel has passed
i am sorry but 3pm is when i get out of school and i have dinner after and he has brecfast whatttttt
Garett I think that squirrel 🐿 was dead 💀😭
garrett. where did you get that harry potter shirt. no actually this is serious. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT SHIRT. TELL ME. TELL ME NOW GARRETT
I want to marry Garrett
i just realised its 3-4pm and i might have woken up at 1:40...  edit: i dont know what I was trying to say here... i was VERY sleep deprived lol...
he is so handsome and funny 😎
Why doesn't he eat the frootloops for breakfast? lmao
Before my Fair passed away I would just sit and watch TV with him
Honestly, garret is doing so much better than I am just because he got dressed
I never thought I would finally be able to understand why I sneeze with there’s sunlight until now. Thanks Garret! I don’t feel as strange anymore🥲😂
Why do I feel like I'm looking at a more energetic version of myself...? Like this is me before the age of 12 and with out the structure of school 😂 can I have this energy back?
29:27 bruh who else hear the labyrinth song 😂
I want to have a tour in Garrett place he has a lot of interesting items
Kkkkkk... Since there is no "YEAH WE NEED THE  *A NIGHT IN GARRETTS LIFE* VIDEO" comment: tis is it😁💛
everyone needs someone like garrett in their life, he really deserves the world
Unless you know how to use a sword and clearly you don’t or you say that fat bat because they work great with people trying to kill you
did the squirrel get it's sweater?
I’m hanging on by a thread right now, and you and Andrew are helping and being that thread for me. Thank you sweets🥲
i watched 6 min of this forgetting i already watched it but i’m gonna keep watching it
YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT TRACKS? THERES A TRAIN DOWN THE ROAD
Garrett, darling, please invest in some deep pocket fitted sheets, best thing I did. My husband always pulls the sheets off the mattress but now he can’t because the sheets fit properly ☺️  Also!! Highly recommend the Yana sleep pillow. It’s like a pregnancy pillow, but better! Organic cotton and bamboo so it doesn’t get sweaty and gross + it never looses its shape. 10/10
I was today years old when I found out that Andrew is approximately a year older than me. Neat.
Garrett without glasses 😍😍 and with them 😍😍
the editing its just too good
Rewatching older garrett videos to keep me sane and oh my.... I needed this chaotic good back ahahah
Garrett, do you have any advice for people with anxiety (me😃👍🏻)
I love Garrett so much!!!
Hola hermano tengo un proyecto, sobre cómo los estadounidenses imaginan la vida en mexico y como los mexicanos imaginan la vida en estados, así que busco contactos como tú que me puedas ayudar colaborando en esto espero te interese, ¡¡saludos desde México!!
This made me so much happier today❤❤❤❤
Wait you mean not everyone sneezes at the sun??? That’s the only way I sneeze, i’ve been doing it since kindergarten..
Garret and Andrew are acting like an old married couple.
I ship wine lady and garrett so hard
THE THUMBNAIL IS SO ADORABLE
29:29 how i envy you....       tall people.
I just got my figure of you 😁😁😁😁👍👍👍👍👍 love from Australia xxxxxx
Sneezing is your quirk
Milk and vodka wtf 🤣🤣🤣
✨🎶Grapefruits are green in august Grapefruits are green in august....but in July....🎶✨🍊💚🍓 14:40
This is my most favoritest video ever.
"You know what I hear every morning?" *stkakitkitskitakitaskit* "SQUIRRELS" I want to be Garrett he just has so much fun with life :)
Does the dream car remind me of the Ben ten grandads caper van. ?? Just me
Having a sword by your bed isn't strange. Especially since you use to live in Memphis, TN!
I love himmmm
You make me want to HOP in the dryer and TUMBLE around until I DIE
33:22 freeze frame is terrifying
NOT THE DECORATIVE PLATES
aw i already love this
Hey Garrett! How’s it going bro? Great video! To answer your question “What’s something you’ve been doing over quarantine to feel better?” I’ve been watching your videos really! Hope you have a good day!
Omg you should make a sunroom on top of you're roof.
I'm in love with Garrett 💘
me and garrett are 18% lol
Garreettt we need moree videos like this pleaseee keep uploading
You know what, only really saw this man on the queen mary series on Shane's channel. But after all that bulls*t Shane has been caught in, I decided to check up on the guy that basically got bullied in all of those Shane videos... I was not disappointed! Loved this video, and I love his energy
Garrett Watts is an incredible human.
i've watched this video over 14 times in the last 48 hours-
Garrett you are such a goof and i love that you are nothing but yourself. you make me smile even when i am sad along with the rest of your followers, thank you and Andrew for everything you guys do!
i got to say this ... they're eating on decorative plates
I was drinking my McDonald’s coke...then once Garrett talked about hopping into the dryer, and tumble around until he dies....my coke came out my nose. 😂😂😂
Laughs in **StAy At HoMe MoM**   Never know what day or time it is 🤪😅
Yet
Garret is chaotic good
he is just the most adorable person on this planet.
"Outer space is literally infinite and socks for sure don't matter" is honestly such a comforting sentiment like thank you??
The birthday cake for 3 pm breakfast is the most relatable shit for me lmfao. 🤣
8:27 sounds like his relationship with Shane 💀💀
2020 was a year of the universe shifting through portals(not that that's the only reason) obviously there are scientific reasons but that is the witchy one
love that you still need a sword even when being 6.2 haha <3
Garrett and Andrew's friendship describes my friendship with my one, only, and last friend on this world. Him and I have known each other for at least six years. We are great friends just like Garrett and Andrew. Kind of a bromance/brother kind of thing. We're wonderful friends, and it warms my heart to watch you both be such great friends.
im so thankful for garrett and his wholesome channel :')   he just has best friend energy. hes someone who's able to make me go from crying and suffering the biggest headache (bc of the crying) to remembering everything that makes me happy and im just so happy  so basically thank you garrett :')                                 btw yes, this is just now happening and the reason i was crying is bc i saw other people crying, and im just really soft and emotional, so ofc i also started crying, and then i was just thinking of how much people go through and how its so hard to get a break, but yeah im just vv emotional and thank you garrett <3      edit: i spent almost 10 minutes writing this-
Dang i though me and Andrew had the same birthday for a sec
Id love to watch a night in garretts life while experiencing a night in my life, ofc
11:30am??? Youve got me beat by at least a couple hours
Still waiting for the night in my life video 😭 who else is too?!!
I hope like deep down, Garrett made that baby Yoda for Andrew- it would be super c. u. t.  e. omg-
Right ok I’m guna say ! I REALLY REALLY wanna just do all his chores because I’m that kinda gay , but then he can make more cooking with and for rats and make forts , you gotta support peoples dreams
Garrett is my fave person on the entire planet....ever...no question...at all
I wish I had friends like Garrett and Andrew lol
I'm exactly the same person as Garrett just minus the positive attitude and friends.
And I got a magazine about breeaad~
Honestly, my bf sleeps with a tomahawk and a blowdart gun next to our bed 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
not me realizing i have PSR
I have been very ill since March. Watching Garrett's videos with his hyper energy paired with Andrew's laugh is exactly what I needed right now.
I laughed this whole video
25:45 26:37 29:17 29:45 31:44 32:47
Are you sure that squirrel is you know alive
10:36 cutest person alive I need Gman iml
I still watch this video, I love Andrew and Garrett together. I stg, I’m gonna start listening to the podcast. They are so great, I’m sorry to bring this up but I never see a straight man as comfortable in his sexuality as Andrew, literally comfortable with Garrett saying they live together and that they are married. Most straight guys would be like “uh wth” yknow what I mean? I love them so MUCH they are so healthy for each other! My favorite friendship on the internet.‘I want to meet them someday
The clip were garret was singing to Andrew on the roof "You cant escape you are stuck up here"🤣 I cant
garrett is the entire weirdcore aesthetic is a single body
Hey, garrett? What make is your pregnancy pillow? Me and my brother both freakishly tall (lmao) and were tryna find a good pregnancy pillow each, you speak quite well of that one (and you're also tall) so I think it would work for us lol <3
Honestly, Garrett's distractiveness is what makes his videos so watchable and relatable for this ADHD-er. When I was his age, I had similar hours, getting up at 2pm, etc, etc. We are kindred spirits. Also, I live in Wa. State, not too far from his brother's place. I should also mention that this vid wouldn't exist without Andrew and his genius ability to make a congruent and entertaining story out of a  mad-man's rants.
Every-single-time that meme wine lady appears...I ask myself, how does she feels about this videos? Does she watches them? 🤣🤣🤣
Is the Garret doll coming back? It's been sold out for a while? Please please make another one, I missed this one♥️
my god  , you deserve everything good in this world and more
im 5 months late but ive recently gotten obsessed with the mcu again and its helping me get through quarantine :D
I did not realized Garret and Andrew made a video on Aug 17. That's my birthday and now I am realizing this and just seeing this video made my night. I'm honestly really happy and seeing these two cuties having fun, you go girls! Love you two and hope you're doing well during this time. Stay safe<3<3
i wonder how garrets doing with his crocheting
Garrett and Andrew are the most genuine people ever and man I wish I was their friend. But like... where ya get ya pregnancy pillow. That's next level 😅
Still waiting for the Grapefruits Are Green In August single
Garrett is the only reasons I will watch ads. He's just too good not to do it for him
So....where is the "night in your life" video 📹 🤔
Ghosts robbers skeletons and BAD GUYS.
This is me Please Upload
Hi Garrett I’m rlly late to watching this video uh my life is also a disaster but I just wanted to say that I too sleep with a sword. Well a machete actually but still a big pointy shiny guy
Garrett worries me because he reminds me of me when I was undiagnosed with ADHD and very depressed 👀
I don’t think I have ever skipped 10 second of his videos becuase everything he does is funny and interesting and I am so sad when his videos end ❤️❤️
🤌🏼you’re 🤌🏼 a ☝🏼 real ☝🏼piece ☝🏼 of 🤌🏼 work 🤌🏼
For the question of the day: Yes! I’ve really wanted a pet snail (or two) and I might be getting one! 🥰❤️
I feel like garret is my adhd
The well-to-do russian steadily use because copyright laterally welcome outside a wry bag. voracious, neighborly work
Me 3:27
14:33-15:17 was the most beautiful thing i’ve ever heard
28:48  "Andrew, I'm not throwing everything-"  *cursive bonk*
Night in your life 🤩!
I miss Garrett :(
Garrett is so lucky to have a friend like andrew. We need to have friends either like andrew or like garrett or like both 😂😂😂
Garret I gotta know is better eating cake with chopsticks instead of a fork?
I sneeze when i look at the sun too
oh I have PSR :)
garrett’s morning face hurts me. why is he so cute. he’s a gigantic grown adult man. but he’s SO *CUTE*
19:01 is that the ghost he got for shane that Shane hated and threw?  I'm glad garret and Andrew got away from someone who cant even appreciate a ghost statuette
Imagine breaking into someone’s house and GARRETT WATTS WITH A SWORD APPEARS
Garrett,   I am so sorry you had to go though Shane and Rylan cutting you off, its horrible and I know how that is, its legit the worst, I hope you are doing well bud, I love you!  - A loyal fan  EDIT: This is off topic ^ but I saw a compilation of him getting cut off and hated on by jokes that were pretty mean to him!
how do i make andrew grunting “there’s a LEMON” my new ringtone

I just came to this video after watching a video titled “garrett watts deserves better” and when he was talking about Pot Baby and his judgemental friends i thought of Garrett being Pot Baby 🥺 its sad
good to know that garrett and i both have psr 😌
nobody:  garrett: *kicks stuff*
I've been hugging my dogs, playing Minecraft, and watching Hermitcraft
*gasp*  Did you just hear a spider???  😆😆😆
30:46 ...
20:04
Garrett and Andrew are honestly friendship goals! 💜
the background music is 100% from adventure time and it’s making me lose my mind from nostalgia
Yeah, I bought a 7 pack of panties with the days of the week written on them. The only way I know what day it is
When he started singing ' A whole new world' ❤ I just couldn't 🤣
my kitty died last month and feels like she died 6 years ago
22:39 Garrett is definitely waiving around a joint lmao
ok but andrew cuddling with a baby yoda toy is the best thing ever
this was posted on my b day uwu
Nobody will ever know how HAPPY I would actually be, to be Garrett's best friend!!  I've never seen such a a genuinely, openly weird, funny, easily amused, just entertaining and nice person (all compliments)! I love you Garrett!!
petition to have Garrett make a full song of ‘grapefruits are green in august’

yes please make nighttime in my life i stay up all night too its really weird
garrett and andrew are my last two braincells trying to be productive for uni during quarantine lol xD
Omg what a pretty singing voice
I kind of came to the conclusion that things seem so long ago is because of the sheer amount of events ad new that floods our news every day.
the damn squirrel sweater
this is a great video please and thank you
lol hmm  i guess I have PSR
MY MOM HAS PSR! I thought she was just crazy!
Oh PLEASE make a video on that time in your lives sir!
I’ve rewatched this video all the way through at least 8 times... certified comfort video
I love you Garret. Honestly you remind me of my partner we live in happy chaos together filled with magic the gathering warhammer and artwork. :)
I think you have adhd sweet boy
Not Garret spelling crochet as crowshay
In quarantine time this was posted a year ago
garret is the only one holding the line after jenna left
YOURE TELLING ME only 18% of people do the sneeze thing??? that ISNT universal?????
Garrett Watts- I love you! Love, drunk and sober Me
I got my little Garrett figure and I'm sooo heartbroken I wasnt lucky enough to get a little bug drawing but I love my little Garrett and I'll put him on my shelf of treasures. ❤
The repulsive statistic evidently connect because heaven unexplainably scatter midst a poor nepal. giddy, smooth refund

I like the concept of your merch it’s original 😍
I aspire to be you
How can a video about nothing be so amazing! 👻
Grapefruits = new song.
I cannot explain how stressed out Garrett makes me but he makes me so happy that it doesn’t matter.
Make a night in my life! (Please)
Sometimes when I’m having a rough day I just rewatch this video to remind me of good friends, sneezes, and gratitude. Good vibes all around :)
pleaaaaase make a night in your life, this was so much fun :)))
garrett crocheting is the highlight of my life, we should crochet together
Playing with my new puppy and training her.  And writing letters.

What I got from this video: don’t go in Garret’s house because he has a sword in every room
Also your figure is sold out!
I totally want to see more day in the life videos!
I would've killed to be in that cabin
Garrets ADHD is my brain 90% of the time & i love him 😂♥️
Garette, your videos have really helped me during this pandemic. I work in politics and my job is serious and usually very stressful so these videos really help me unwind. I am super disappointed that your Character is sold out and would really like to purchase one.   Wishing you and Andrew the best.  -Matt
11:56 I have the exact same shirt as Andrew. When garret did the choose what I am going to eat thing I literally said "D because  that's what I would do...😂😂😂."
omg yes please do a night in you life !
GARRETT WHERE DID YOU GET THE SHIRT BABE!!!!!!???????
I like the small part when they’re both sitting down and Andrew saying he’ll help Garrett stay on track and honestly he just sounds so relieved and that’s the friendship I’d love.
"I got a tinder notification! This might be the one!" 😅😅
Having a little Garrett with an even smaller Benjamin to put around my house and bring places is the cutest thing of life! 😍
Oh you wanna talk about tracks? There's a train down the road!!
the singing, immaculate
I wish I had Garrett’s brain lol
There’s no way Garrett doesn’t at least have ADD
I need this grapefruit song to be a thing 🍊🍊
Wait 14:30 in can we just talk about Garrett's Vibrato and Pitch?? Like 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Grapefruits Are Green In August play that for your baby instead of Mozart
Wait why does Garret have fruit loops in his fridge?
COWBOY BEBOP COFFEE MUG GARETT I LOVE IT AND YOU

I also sneeze when I go from a dark environment to a bright environment and NEVER knew it had a name
This made me feel way less horrible about how I am dealing with this!
he should get fairy lights for his small tree in him back yard that would be sooo cuteee
please, please, please read The Poppy War (The Poppy War, #1)  by  R.F. Kuang
I just noticed when Garrett was on the counter he was way too close to a candle 🕯 and I was a little concerned he would catch on fire
pls do a night in your life video garret!!
His voice sounds a little different. I like it.
Wait there's a name for the sneeze?? I do that all the time and everyone acts like I'm crazy
I love you guys. I can’t say I haven’t thought, “Garret would be exhausting to quarantine with, although entertaining”.
"how have I never gone out that window" I lost it hahahaha
jokes on you, my sense of time has always been warped
Pleasse make a light in my life video! We need it!
Been sewing
Thank you for providing an explanation for why the sun makes me sneeze 😊 I never knew

Garrett, can you make a list of the movies/tv shows you're watching??? I'm very interested to see what's on your list. Pleaseeeeeeeeeee :<
Wait y’all were in Washington state awww i live in Washington state 😩😩
omg, I never knew that my sun sneeze had an actual scientific name?! I guess I'm part of the 18%
i can’t tell if garrett is heavily on adderall or needs it desperately
I strive to be as chaotic as Garrett
I never realized how much I enjoy watching chaotic you tubers until now. I’m just realizing so many I watch are just chaotic almost all the time. Garrett probably being the most chaotic
i would sell my home if it meant that i could spend a day with Andrew and Garret
I thought everyone sneezed from bright lights!
Omg I love Garret I am so proud of him for uploading more and dropping toxic people out of his life. I love him a Andrew they are so cute when they are together it make me smile
I would love to hang out with these two. I feel like there is never a dull moment with all the weird random shit happening. These are the people I wanna be surrounded by XD
You tubes answer to Tristan Shandy!
They are the goals of friendship. Hilarious. Supportive and so much alike
i would really enjoy an entire video of Andrew and Garrett’s cottage core adventure
garrett reminds me of an adorable version of dwight
i love cats! they love mice...but in all the naughty ways.
2020 gets better with every Garrett Watts video
Garrett I know this video is two months old so you won’t see this comment, but you have helped me SO MUCH during quarantine. I also struggle with really bad sleep schedules and I have zero energy to clean my house or do anything like cook or act like an adult. But your positive personality really helps me feel like I’m not living in a simulation and honestly I’ve watched this video like 30 times because whenever I’m having a bad day it really helps me get something done. Anyways. Long rambling message over. Thanks friend. ❤️
this is so chaotic and I love it
a tinder notification! this might be the one... thats so me
Ngl I first read the title as “End my Life.”  *and got really worried.*
Petition for a whole series about Garrett and Andrew's adventures in Washington, it looks so beautiful! I'd love to see you guys just hanging around different places, even traveling abroad when it's safer. Love you! ♥️
I sneeze when I got outside too.  For me it's just allergies
I have been playing ✨ m i n e c r a f t ✨😀❤
i got bunnies!!
I wonder what happened to the two babies lol
Drop the grapefruit song on iTunes
I need a friend like Andrew to keep me on track I AM LITERALLY GARRETT 😭
i’m sorry but i absolutely love that harry potter shirt where did you get it?
i have CAT shoes too and those are my exact thoughts
Waiting for his new single to drop "Grapefruits are Green" 🎵🎵🎶
I just realized this was posted a day before my birthday 😂( and yes I’m back again)
Please release husbands on the roof as a single, thank you 🙏🏻
Garrett gives me Gene Belcher energy
Garrett telling me it’s okay to feel aimless finally makes me feel better in life-... like— Garrett reminds me identically to myself, I usually have to wake up at like 2 - and Garrett; the sword and pregnancy pillow are not strange at all, so it’s good to know 🖤🖤 we love you 🖤🖤✨✨ also— seeing morning sneeze, made me sneeze 😂— I also,.. I eat breakfast around 3/4 too 😂😂 gosh.. watching this makes me think of myself.. so adhd and I am LITERALLY this bad when it comes to focusing on ANYTHING
very prety voce gary
A night in Garrett’s life yes pls
omg i didnt know that was a gene that i could have. i thought everyone stares at the light to sneeze
His videos seem so damn long like in a goodway because so damn much is happening every second. Sorta like a dream
garrett: i never get distracted ever! also garrett: i have never climbed out that window before-
The sun makes me sneeze too. Definitely thought there was more than 18% that experienced this :o
Garrett.. Has too many things.. IS THAT A GOLDEN GIRLS THROW PILLOW!~ (I have a problem)
AWW THEIR MARRIED LOL😂
I think Garrett is genuinely a great singer 🙂😍🎼!
If only Garrett wasn’t gay omg :(
Heyyyyyyyyyy I have PSR too, I didn’t know it was called PSR. I thought I was just allergic to the sun.
I swear I have that exact keyboard 😂
Okay but why’s no one taking abt his Harry Potter forest shirt? Garret we NEED to know where you got it
Love him! Best stoner tv!
Yup. This year feels so long yet short at the same time. You might think it's May, but it's actually July. But, not. It's currently November.
“UPPERCUT YA TO THE MOON” 😭😭😭
I live in Washington wish I was in LA its cold here,I would love to see night in your life
I though I was the only on who sneezes in the sun😂
Andrew sleeping is so cute 👉🏻👈🏻 🥺🥺
I DIDNT KNOW  MY CONDITION WAS CALLED A PHOTIC SNEEZE REFLEX UNTIL THIS VIDEO OH MY GOD????
You're a bandaid on my ass lmfao thanks i needed this today lmao
THOSE TEXTS WERE NOT AT 3 PM THEY SAY 12:20 AM ON THEM 😂😂
Wtf you literally just made me sneeze too lmfao wtf ok
Andrew and Garrett are such a comedic duo i love
full movies
Be cottage boys please 🥺
i watch tiny creatures ( the show ) with my boyfriend
I want to be Garret's roommate and be the new pregnancy pillow
He hasn't posted cuz he wants us to watch all of his videos duh
MORE VIDEOS WE LOVE YOU!!!!
I love you so damn much. You make me laugh. I don't understand how you're still single. But then again, I kinda do. Watching you makes me feel better.
Okay I have a genuine question! Wtf happened between Garrett Andrew and Shane?? And this is coming from my concern for Garrett and Andrew's well beings because they never really talked about it just stopped showing up in one anothers videos, and I know Shane had been a shitty fucking person SO did Garrett finally see that Shane is a bad person and get out or did Shane do anything to Garrett specifically??
Who thinks that andrew and Garrett are secretly dating?
I need a straight version of Garrett so I can marry him
Make a night in your life!
Garrett: Trying to be more productive Also Garrett: Trying to survive a nonexistent house fire
Garrett here summing up what we all wish we had the ability and imagination to do to pass the time right now!

We have the same couch cool... except mind doesnt look so frumpy..... no offense 🙂
it feels like this was uploaded a year ago- oh crap
y'all only realized that time is a lie and this is a simulation.
i feel like garrett is pot baby and wine lady is his judgmental friends
Garrett what watch is that?
Does anyone else notice the  cup from my hero academia
i wish i could marry him but as soulmates
This video made me buy a pregnancy pillow and I have no regrets. I’m laying on it right now and I’m so cozy
WHERE CAN I GET THAT FORBIDDEN FOREST SHIRT
I miss Garrett I wished he posed more often 😔
bruh he has a guest room but andrew sleeps on the couch??
I understand if no one else saw but we just not gonna talk about the edibles in Garretts fridge?! Love that.
Only Garret would think of going out a window he's never gone out of
Was that morning beer?
You're such a cutie patootie
I also have the sneeze!
The part where they were fighting over Garrett getting work done and Andrew just wanting to help him.... I felt that on so many levels 😂
....what is the story behind the shirt? I've been curious about it since I saw it in earlier videos :3
When will Grapefruits are Green be on itunes?
I lost it at “pocket skeleton ” 😂
i lowkey thought he broke his neck ngl i died laughing though. what a great sneex
Garret: "Remember the half time show with j lo and shakira?" Me: oh yeah that was forever ago! Garret: NO THAT WAS THIS YEAR!! Me  👁👄👁
Do a night in my life please
Garrett used to swords and I put them next to my bed
I HAVE THAT THE SNEESE THE DOCTRO COULDN'T UNDORSTAND WHAT IT WAS
IT FEELS LIKEB IV'E PLAYED EVREY GAME
Garett and Andrew are a cute couple lowkey lol Andrew is good with everybody even with Morgan
Bruh I do the sneeze thing too and sometimes I shine flashlights in my eyes to sneeze😎
Garrett got me into Harry Potter
PLEASEEE make a night in your life video!!!
I have never heard garret speak this fast....
Update... Garrett caused a fire and had to go through the window because he didn’t know that decorative gold-rimmed plates are not microwave-safe.
as a person who lives in washington we were glad to have you
Grapefruits are green in August... but in July, they are not grapefruits.  Your song gave me more life than I've felt in a week.
someone said that andrew sounds like remy from ratatouille and i physically cannot stop hearing it
Me
I want 2 marry
if Andrew hadn't arrived yet....who. was. filming. Garrette???
Andrew sleeping is the cutest thing tho. Is that creepy to say lmao?
garrett and andrew are the new dan and phil
for the end question, watching minecraft youtubers 😸👍
Maybe you should look into The old religions you can go down the demon occult route or you could go the god route I suggest the god route and the Dead Sea scrolls.. I personally don’t fear any of this.
Suicides sky high.. kids depressed.. doesn’t seem really worth all of this..
The fact that the smashed pine cone is still on the floor at the end of the video gives me life
I  think I have photic sneeze reflex 👍🏼
So, I’ve come to the conclusion that we all need a friend like Andrew.
Here beefor 2 millon views <3                         Btw best youtuber is Garrett watts      Garrett watts 2020 :))
You look like harry potter
So who was filming Garrett before Andrew showed up??
“I don’t want someone coming for my snow globes” 😂
I have been doing more meditations and it's been helping to calm me down in this weird time~
I want to one day have a roof that I can just climb onto and look out at the scenery peacefully while listening to music(probably BTS) through my headphones
Only person I can watch for 40 mins straight and laugh the entire time. 😂
I know what a mortgage is, but getting up early is ungodly! The sun makes me sneeze too. Thanks to you I now know what it's called.
tbh i need an Andrew in my life to keep me on track  😩
XD Garrett is so adorable lol <3
Tbh, I've been just working still and watching SAO and old movies! Especially playing Amoung Us
i aspire to be you
omg i’ve always sneezed when i look at the sun and my family said i was weird!!!!! woahhhh
i need the green grapefruit song on spotify right now
I might unironically start wearing a pocket skeleton
Cute me and Andrew share birthdays ❤️ garret is so fucking adorable I wish I was in quarentine with him! I'm with a stroppy 3 year old.
The sun makes me sneeze too!
Wait Garret posted this a month ago?? It legitimately feels like it’s been a year.
When i was little I thought I was allergic to the sun - also chocolate tends to trigger it for me too. I really don’t understand how or why.
I’m glad other people are still praising Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle, everyone involved deserves a Lifetime Achievement Award
when i needed garrett most <3
Watching this video made me laugh the hardest I have in months
Garret you are the best but you need to post more but I still love you and Andrew too keep it up man you make may depressed fucking self heal but keep it up please and stay safe please I love y’all
I also have the sun sneeze thing!
ok but andrew's hair looks so cool tho
6:37 heehee yeah. ☺️ We have the best state
Are you friends with Shane still or do I hate you now 🤨
like
I missed you!
Garret:* Conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy*  Me: You’ve been hanging out a lot with Shane haven’t you
I never knew sneezing when the sun hit you has a name... I learned something from this video
the fact that you ate cake with chopsticks lmao you're amazing
Not me shipping Andrew and Garett 😌
Goblincore vibes from this lad
#Gardew forever!
I’ve been meditating everyday
ive been spending my time on twitter and I'm addicted
this week feels like it lasted two days, yet the past seven months have felt like a decade.
I got 2 pet rats  to keep me company
Pregnancy pillow... I slept for half a year with 1,5 meters plushy snake around my body and called it Nagini xD
i love you guys soo much.     i've been playing all types of video games with my online pals :)
Do the a night in my life video!!! We ALL NEED THAT!!!!😍😍
Sleeps with sword in the bed  Literally anybody else: woah that’s really messed up Garrett: aww cute
Your quality and on screen charisma is amazing. I feel like a piece of cardboard in front of the camera.
Seeing Garrett and Andrew happy makes me happy

OMG HES STILL USING THAT WINE GIRL YES OMGGG JEJEJSBND
Oh Garrett how I have missed you. I had the biggest, dumist grin on my face this whole video. Love you guys so much.
Ima need that video! And I’ve been eating a lot of jersey shore reruns lol
We never saw this version of Garrett in Shane’s videos
Bro I need another video
I swear this man is convolks twin brother
I forgot how absolutely chaotic and distracted his mind is
Do the night!!!
Omg pocket skeleton! I do that too! Love my skelly buddy
Living with Garrett would be the most chaotic, crazy, amazing and fun adventure every day
Is "Green Grapefruits" available on iTunes?
This was beautiful.
I’ve been reading Harry Potter again for the 73564th time but this time I read it in Swedish and English (usually I just read the English version).
Garret I love you. But you have to lose that vest and your old jacket 😘
garret's videos are the only vidoes i actually *laugh* at
Trying to get out of bronze in league of legends
when he started singing “grapefruits are green in aUgUsT” I LOST ITTJDJDJF😭😭😺😺
As I’m not in quarantine but I play minecraft with my friends to get through time
When Garrett started singing like the Fairy Godmother in Cinderella I LoSt iT
PLEASE make a night in the life of. This video was amazing, need more.
Andrew seems to have more fun filming with garret than Shane
I learned about PSR in psychology!
You should organize your house again
From man to man How much was that pregnancy pillow?
Garrett is so cool! I would love to know him personally. Like if you agree. (Omg I’ve become one of “those” people I’m so sorry😐)
whenever I need to cheer up I am coming back to this video to hear Garett sing lol
Garrett making up songs is what I needed. made my entire week hahahaha
Im literally crying laughing
I want your HP button up so bad, did you get it at a thrift store or do you have a link to where you bought it?
The only thing keeping me on a schedule is school haha
I love Garrett so much! He is very much intelligent despite being very goofy as well. You make me smile everytime I watch your videos. I feel there is someone who helps me understand that even when you're in your own sometimes we don't have everything in order. And it's okay.
hey you dont need tinder you have andrew:)
Night in my life!
He's congratulating me for being a good boy. Oh so funny. Got to love Garrett
The singing is what got me 😂😂😂
i need friends like garrett

Plot twist : Garret has a pregnancy pillow because he’s pregnant .
Omggggg I thought I was the only one that sneezes when there in the sun😂😣
Please become the new shane cause i need it

Garett I love you so much
you're a band-aid on my arse" LMAO

I've never wanted to be friends with someone so badly 😖
Answer: Watching CSI: Miami and a bunch of k dramas 😆
Answer: Aquaponics has my attention, currently

I never realized how similar Shane and Garrett sound.
Hi I'm back for the 5th time, just wanted to add that I have a pregnancy pillow too and I don't have a baby in my stomach, I just read it would be good to sleep with one when having chronic pain lol. And it almost feels like a soft hug and I'm single so it's all good 🤗
14:00 “3pm ain’t that bad” The phone saying 12:00🙈
ME AND ANDREW HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY i am complete
dude...I love you.
This is giving me Grey Gardens vibes and I’m here for every bit of it
Ok Andrew is just as damn precious as Garrett  those 2 are 110% best friend goals
10000% always a 💃 👽 so it was a pretty accurate spit out of your explanations garrett! 💜🕰 time may mean nothing right now but NOTHING IS FOREVER including these times. Love you!
Garrett holding like 5 different half filled cups of coffee all from different places throughout this video is honestly such a mood 😂
6:48 make a video about it!
is it just me, or has Andrew has gotten more handsome(didn't know that was possible)over the duration of this pandemic?????
Can Andrew and Garrett just do a podcast that I so can love the world again also they are releasing scott pilgrim game again
I just started writing again and trying to complete an entire story this quarantine, while binge watching some of my favorite YouTubers like you ☺️ it’s honestly been tough, not being able to work, but I try everyday to still remain positive. I hope everyone’s doing all right too.
Their friendship is everything I want in every way xD (also night owls unite and please make a night vid)
ayyy i’m part of that 18% of sun sneezers!!!
I like how Andrew just keep saying huh what what is this 😂😂😂😂
Why is Andrew soo cute 😻
OMG you should do paintings on your roof (the gray background in your outro)
Andrew and Garret are friendship goals
I can only hope that in the midst of my manic breakdown, and we're on the roof of my home, that Im there with a friend like Andrew.
Me and Andrew are birthday bros🎉
I always watch your videos while I get ready for school because they make me laugh and help me wake up!
Watching the ads y not
Grapefruit are green in August!!! 🎶
garret and andrew really lived our cottagecore dreams
Garrett has the energy of a small child in the body of a giant adult.
You look so amazing ily
i missed andrews laugh SO MUCH and i feel better about my fucked sleep schedule and months- long un productivity, you the man garrett 🌼💘
You said to check in in your friends. And you don't know me very well, but I know you a little from videos and kind sorta in a way consider you as a round a bout way a friend..... #no real friends in quarantine, so how have you been??
Garrett: *singing about grapefruits* Me:👁️👄👁️
Do night in your life and please restock your Merchandise I didn’t know about it yet :)
Please tell me where I can get one of those wall mounted CD players with a pull cord. My life will be complete. Well, happier 🤣
I am just now realizing how much Shane copies Garrett like his whole personality - literally everything
I want that ghost for my collection. Lol
I love these guys. They bring me joy!
I've subconsciously turned watching Garrett and Andrew's videos as a coping mechanism for my sh. Not that I'm complaining...
Today someone told me that I act like Garrett and that was the best compliment I will ever get, I was so happy😃😂
I'm so glad Garrett, Andrew etc... Didn't get canceled. It must have been a scary moment for them
Squirrel Sweater rant is the BEST ever!
"Did you hear a spider?" 🕷 😆 I did not realize how much I ❤love❤Garrett & Andrew together.
Did kind have a whole joint 👁👄👁 das on perrioddd
Truly Thank you for this video  It made me laugh. At best I'll smile or chuckle due to deep depression and other issues. Hope your video helps others as well.
I eat it makes me feel great
Yeah 2020 has been going on for years even though I know it hasn’t because I still have classes :”)
Is no one gonna point out that Garett took a bath with his watch...
I never comment on YouTube videos. Literally never. But i have to ask, who the hell is disliking this GOLD?
Andrew: “um so wait ..... “ Garrett: “GRAPEFRUITS ARE GREEN IN AUGUSTTTTT”
Hey from Australia Garrett! To deal with Quarantine our here bought myself Pet fishies in my room to keep me company :D
I have an immaculate amount of love for you Garrett
where did you get the edgar allan poe little statue?
35:00
Are you sad that Shane got called if you no reply you is no sad 😢 so reply
When he was crying I was crying with him 🥺

I laughed at the smashed pine cone on the floor while Garret and Andrew eating pizza
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT MY ADULT LIFE IS GONNA LOOK LIKE ISTG
14:33 time stamp to grape fruits are green.
Garrett eight months ago: "i don't own a microwave, i never have and i never will. they are so spooky." Garrett minute 22:57: oh yeah they are in the MICROWAVEEEEE

When you're nibbling with your friends 😂😂❤

Tell me why Andrew is so handsome, I missed him and I din't even know till I watched this video.
Garret can sing!!!! Love it!!!
Garrett thank you so much! You and Andrew were soooo missed!
You're not the only one I know who sleeps with a sword... My uncle does the same. He has like 8.
Garrett, I sleep with a Wiccan athame under my pillow. You're fine dude XD
he’s like richie tozier but without the dirty jokes
This is for every time I come back to this video -> 14:26
This is a little late but I've been going to therapy and just reading and watching you. Love you Garrett ❣️ 😙
why are they friendship goals?
The fact that Garret has TWO copies of that smirking dog is the most him thing I’ve ever seen!
i literally can’t imagine a world without garrett watts like his personality is so contagious and he gives off the best vibe
is it bad that i also think 11:30 is impressively early?
My coping mechanism has just been non-stop watching full metal alchemist brotherhood and forcing my siblings to enjoy it with me 🤙
Garrett would literally be  the best of friends.
My bday is august 7 1991 lol
Lol what did I just watch?
I TOO HAVE PSR!!!!!!
Third time watching this one because I love Garrett so much and he puts me in such a good mood! Thank you Garrett for being a light!
garrett : i just need you to.. *_looks at his phone_* i just got a tinder notification *_tilted his head_* this might be the oneee  🤣
6:30 "We went to Washington." You mean the early epicenter of the disease? Why? Lmao silly boys
THE SNEEZE THING OMG I CANT SNEEZE UNLESS I LOOK INTO SUPER BRIGHT LIGHTS
This man has unbridled Matthew Gray Gubler energy
WE NEED MORE CONTENT
MORE CONTENT
Garrett seriously gives me Tom Green vibes… Got a love 90s nostalgia
garrett you should drop merch :P
Andrews little "noo🥺🤧" at 20:06 is so cute
27:31 stop why did he literally do the exact same thing shane does
whos andrew simpin ove??????🤔🤔🤔
It’s alright, Garrett. I get very scared at night, too. I have a giant teddy bear and I put under the covers and on a pillow, three teddy bears and a Stitch plushie that’s I sleep with because I get scared. I also sleep with two bats and a single crutch. You never know what might happen (:
So Special! So, So Special. Bless his Little Heart and Green Grapefruits in August. Bless Andrew!  Quarantine giggles help! Having pets. Taking walks.  Eating healthier.  Zoom meets with loved ones. Cleaning.
Omg I would love to see that night owl video!!!!
Wait so looking at the sun to sneeze is not something everybody does??
Oh he really is a walking anti depressant 🙂💯
i got rats!!!!!!!!!
ignore this, just keeping my timestamp :》 24:10
garrett u are such a funky little man, ily 😸😸
Honestly, I really like Garret’s home.
Practicing pole dancing! Moving my body was the best for my mental health
A+ content got sooooo much serotonin
I love your videos! they always make me smile and give me something to take my mind off things :)
I have been taking pics and videos of my cat and tried to get it TikTok famous (it didn't work).... Its really fun to work with animals because you never know what they are going to do lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z6L5JYspAI
Please make "a night in your life"!  Would be so fun! ^^
always makes me smile man you are an angel fr
Having a migraine today and this is so soothing and the happy feeling of seeing you guys having fun makes my head tingle in a relaxing way
ok but what if we’re in a black hole and we all died within the universe prior to 2020 and then we got sucked in and our real bodies + planet is disintegrating but we were cloned within the black hole and this is an alternate universe
Lmao why does he have a pregnancy pillow lol honestly doesn’t surprise me lol I own the same one
My manz talkin' without the spacebar
Andrew and Garrett are married🥺🥺😘😘
Also I've been painting more trying to start doing things I like to do more
Definitely need a night in your life
Garret is going to be one of those ultra cool grandpa's that get filmed by their grandchild knitting sweaters for squirrels in their old age and goes viral as the coolest grandpa out
ur so cute :D
Wow I didn't realized that Garett is thicc
The bit about the squirrel really just made me smile. My grandpa used to always feed his squirrels and He would of loved your sweater idea.
Also, your singing gives me Josh Gadd vibes and I love it!
I started reading Webtoons!
Now this is what we need <3
“You’re a band aid on my ass” might be the funniest and greatest insult I’ve ever heard
can you make more little garrets? I need one for my little house
Is it just me or did u really want to see Garrett give those little sweaters to that  squirrel like he’s probably cold and sad he’s probably like darn all my friends make fun of me cuz I’m always naked and never swag enough for them and he just wants something to make him cozy garret if ur seeing this plz I want to see u put a cardigan on a unconscious  squirrel 🐿
he's so talented <3
Garrett’s little “yes” on the roof sent me !
All I kept thinking about was “where did his pocket squirrel go?” But maybe it is now the sauce skeleton
I just want friends like Garret and Andrew
YES!!!!! NIGHT IN MY LIFE!!!!! YES!!!!
imagine garret actually meeting that wine girl..
When the world needed him most, he returned.
Is it just me or has Garret lost more weight after he left shane
If ADHD was a person
OMG I HAVE POT BABY FRIENDS!
Garret's singing voice is so angelic!
My dream  To go shopping with Garrett and Andrew at toys r us and go to wizard world chicago!!!
5:58 - 7:00 is like my favorite part of the video because ugh just imagine skipping town with your most trusted friend. Especially during a weird time like this. Playing in nature and just living your life in such a sweet looking area. THE DREAM. I have second hand happiness that Garrett and Andrew got to have that experience. It’s so unique and you can feel their bond through the video. I’ve watched this video so many times >___<
I've been keeping up my streaks with Duolingo learning Japanese. I make sure to practice every day. I hope that the next time I am able to go to Japan that I can speak the language well enough to actually use it.
Thank you for sharing
Oh my god don't watch this high I'm panicking now about the time
The ghost on the couchhhh omggg 😭😭
WE LOVE AND STAN GARRETT ALWAYS AND FOREVER
i love you garret
Garrett you gotta change your metric of success. your sleep schedule is not bad! being different than other people does not mean that other people have a better way of doing things! maybe while everyone is asleep it gives you peaceful time to be productive or have nice alone time. I have a few friends who don't feel like they are truly awake until 8pm so they typically sleep in the day and be awake at night. the way you live works for YOU. you don't have to make excuses for people on the internet. if you accept that you are powerful and time doesn't exist anyway.. then you'll be happier and more successful than if you actually changed your sleeping schedule or weird habits! its all about perspective... don't feel bad because you do things differently... accept it and then become emperor of the world. because it is possible
Awe 🤭😱😭🤩🤗🥰🎉🥳🙆🏻‍♀️😮🤪 MISSED YOU SO SO MUCH ♥️❤️ GARRET  ❤️❤️ THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR LIFE WITH US
"This Is My DAMN SQUIRREL SWEATER 😡"  "ClANg cLaNg ClANg cLaNg THAT WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE IN MY HEAD😡"  "THATS YOU CrUnCH"
so during quarantine something I've been doing to feel better is me and my friend are now on discord and one of us puts on a movie or show, we watch together virtually, drink wine and cook our food... Idk mostly just trying to do as much as I can with friends through video calls. Like for all my friends birthdays, we've zoom called because ironically enough most of us are born in the months of april-august so all of us didn't have celebrations outside ordering food. We zoom called a group of like 10 of us for each birthday so far (it's been like 5 with one more coming up soon) and we each have our own alcohol and play virtual board games and gossip about random things etc. It's a nice time to get creative!
To feel better during these times, I have been playing a videogame that I used to love as a child that eases my mind.
WHEN THE SQUAD WENT TO TEXAS AND U AND MIRGAN ARE JUST VIBEING LOVE U SOOOOOO MUCH
I aspire for my marriage to be like this💗 congratulations!!😝💗 Give the little squirm the sweater andrew!!!
I love these two so much omg
wait I thought I was the only one that could sneeze for looking into a light
Was it just me or did I see the 11 doctors sonic screwdriver?!
Will they be back on stock ?
The most entertaining Day in My Life video I've ever seen.
He’s the walking definition of A.D.D.😂
The dramatic somersault into pointed toe bicycle kick in defense of the fuckery. Me.
When I eat and my stomach is full i sneeze about five times in a row. I still dont know why I have random single hiccups throughout the day.
Oh...... he still makes videos
Wow that is so weird, I also have that psr, but I never knew what it was and I weirdly thought I was the only one that did that 😂
i was vibing and getting my serotonin but had to pause the video and take a break at seeing garrett eat cake with chopsticks
me waiting for Now Im a Baby remix
I wad feeling super down super sad overwhelmed. And than Garrett came along and I'm here laughing.  Thank you.
I also sleep with a sword! My family and friends think it is weird but I am at least one step ahead of a robber if they break in. They would never expect me to have a sword in my bed frame that is hidden and yet easily accessible. I am a genius and everyone else is just jealous of the fact that they don't have a sword to beat the shit out of robbers with.
Quarantine has been super hard these past months and it sucks that I cannot see my boyfriend for weeks at a time, so one thing we now do is FaceTime each other every single night and talk about our day until we fall asleep; and honestly I think that has only made our relationship stronger.
d
hey garret you shouldnt use melatonin you should use cbd oil
Does anybody else just like really want a mini garret
During quarantine I've been baking more. It helps me relax :)
In quarantine—- My roommate and I have been making drinking games out of old cringey Disney channel shows and original movies
I can respect a man that keeps a sword in the bathroom.
I love you guys your hilarious 🤣🤣
I've begun teaching myself realistic drawing again and gotten into painting a little to keep my mind sane.
WAIT GARRET WHY DO YOU HAVE A FRAMED PHOTO OF MRYTL SNOW
Petition for a whole series about Garrett and Andrew's adventures in Washington, it looks so beautiful! I'd love to see you guys just hanging around different places, even traveling abroad when it's safer. Love you! ♥️
*inhales* 🎶 Yes 🎶
im pretty sure you have adhd cause im the same exact way without my meds
This is just what i needed hahaha
Lol I thought I was the only one who has a morning sneeze!!!
Oh my god, you are so adorable. We must protecc at all costs.
Is it bad I saw the sword and was more interested in the accordion mount
Garrett’s the real empath here♥️
Gardening! Growing our own food. Also, weirdly, home security? Lol but seriously
That one winnie the pooh mug is everything. Good thing I own one
Garrett should go to 2021 Anime Next, an anime convention in Alantic City. There's casinos, restaurants, Japanese bands playing, role playing,  candy, books, charms and an arcade.
"Unleash the lead from my pistol into my head pouring krystal on my dead body."
Can't figure out if Garrett annoys me or entertains me, regardless I have a headache from trying to keep track of everything.
During quarantine to feel a little less stressed, i have been binging netflix 😂
HOW DID I NOT KNOW I HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY AS ANDREW 🥳🥳
M E L A T O N I N

Contemplating suicide.

This is major manic energy lol
I need more videos of you and Andrew in Washington, plz.
This Bromance always makes me smile
I just remembered your favorite natural environment is the forest and you and Andrew went to Washington and enjoyed being in the woods
Petition to cast Garrett as Milo Thatch in the live action Atlantis.
Garrett’s chaotic energy honestly gives me so much life
Thanks for making me laugh ❤😝🤗💛💜💙🎂🍕 I have been singing karaoke and cuddling with my furbabies because music and hugs are my fav goto when im sad ;-)
garrett is the most chaotic good of “boys will be boys”
Watching this video and the haunted ice cream video truly made my morning. I’m so happy for you Garrett! You and Andrew are best friend goals! Stay positive and safe Garrett!
I was today years old when I found out that I have psr
I’m here to cleanse myself of that tiktok video I swear to god this is the most pure thing I need it
garrett youre my favorite human ever pls i love you sm
I love that these vids are 30mins because you can tell there was some work put in and I love it compared to other YouTubers that talk for 5 mins and put 10 mins of fillers in the rest
...thank you for teaching me why I sneeze everyday when hitting sunlight. I thought I was part vampire with mild sun allergies 🤷🏼‍♀️
Your background makes you look like Arte the gem mining dawg from Webkinz 🦴
i’ll donate my pull out couch for andrew
People are saying that when historians and archaeologists and people like that were making the modern calendars they were off by a few years and 2020 is actually 2012
The pocket skeleton was the best thing ever
OMG I SNEEZE TOO EVERYTIME I GO OUT IN THE SUN
I fuking love Andrew and Garrett
LITERALLY I THOUGHT JLO AND SHAKIRAS THING WAS LAST YEAR
I legitimately did not think I would come here to learn anything but today Garrett taught me what a PSR is. 🤷🏽‍♀️
This is the wholesome content I needed today🥰
"did the simulation just reset itself?"   DANGANRONPA 2 INTENSIFIES
Garret, I just thought you would enjoy knowing my cat (the one in my yt picture) enjoys this particular video for some reason, so enjoying being on replay for a while :)
Garrett’s singing voice is pure gold 🤣
me: *going on youtube* “OH MAYBE GARRETT WATTS IS STILL ALIVE.”     also me: *see your two new videos* OMG HE FINALLY POSTED i may have or may have not cried of happiness.
11:10
8:37 😂🤣
Lost my mom recently... there’s a real good reason I’ve been binging Garrett videos ever since. Therapeutic joy!  ❤️
Omg. What do u do for a living. Wake  up and live your life at 3 pm. I'm jealous hahahahaha
God, I LOVE your laugh sooooo much :)
A day in Garrett’s life is just a day as my sims when I don’t pay attention to them
tell me if you missed easter cause me too 🐣
Garrett not even owning ice is what i exist for
I love watching these videos at 3:00am💗💓💝 l
Also wait 18%? I thought everyone did that
This reminds me of those a-day-in-my-life-with-adhd video, but much more extreme👁👅👁
As someone who worked all through quarantine I feel like the year went by pretty quick
"A man never forgets his first broom"  amazing xD
I double check everything the notifications bell and the all settings. And wth!! I found out garret posted again from another YouTube video... still it’s nice he’s back
over quarantine ive checked out sara bareilles and i am so grateful i found her music. shes really made me feel better during this time.  you should check her out!!
Definitely need a night in your life vid.
I mean sleeping with a sword isn't weird
The world needed this video so badly. Bless you, sweet man. 💞
Garrett, I really enjoyed this video but YOU CANNOT THROW ANY MORE PLANTS. NO. BAD GARRETT.   Plants have feelings okay 😭
Then there's me who's been working this whole time and its basically the exact same as before. 😂😂
I'm watching the ads. Only for Garrett. Also, the face that ghost, robbers, and skeletons aren't in the same category as bad guys, makes Garrett all the more pure and such a cinnamon roll.
This video is like my brain
Quarantine Andrew and Garrett just hit different 😭❤️
I've been cosplaying during quarantine :>
I need to know where to get that Baby Yoda plush asap
Bro whenever I have to sneeze but can’t quite get there I turn my flashlight on and stare at it till I sneeze
I lost myself at grapefruits are strawberries a month before... Then it was fine....then fuckin creepy roof song made me die Hahaha x
25:01
can we just appreciate how wholesome and cute he looks in thumbnail? 🥰☺️
The S-E-R-O-T-O-N-I-N 😍😍
A day in my life! 2020: Ignoring Shane Dawson to make sure my career is ok
Staying busy is how I cope, no matter what it is I'm doing as long as it's something lmao
Did you get the sweater on the squirrel? ☺ run by joji, one of my favorites
Twas needed, sthank you 🙆‍♀️
god i love garret i just cant help but smile when i watch him
34:00 yeah I don't think so...
I think we need the videos from the best friends cottage trip .  Plzzxx
it's 3:30 AM and i just burst out laughing at "strawberries are actually just the exact same thing as grapefruits, but just a month earlier"
GRAPEFRUITS ARE GREEN!!!
OMFG me and my sister both have PSR she’s calls it achoo syndrome
As someone with ADHD, this video is a literal representation of my mind 24/7 😂😂 So glad you're back Garrett! Much love to you 💙
Note to self: never watch Garrett's videos high again lmao
I hollered a lil too loud when he threw the "toothbrush" amd said im sorry i like to pretend
garrett...are you wearing your watch in the shower-
Love you Garrett!
31:46
When he was singing and said Andrew's birthday was on the ninth and it showed it was the seventh I was like mine was on the ninth and then he said 19 and I was like but I turned 18 XD.
Garrett is so chaotic and I live for it😍
Watching this in like 50 second intervals while I throw the ball for dog.
14:23 THERES A LEMON
I’ve never seen anyone put cereal in the fridge...am I missing something 😂 I must try now
I've been hanging out with my friend and crocheting her elderly toothless bow legged dog blankets
Okay but the whole sneeze thing IM THAT WAY TOO! People think I'm weird when I'm like oh just stare at the sun or a bright light source it'll draw it out.
This has to be the most unapologetically chaotic day in my life vid ever and I am so here for it! 🤟
I love Garrett and Andrew 😁 they always make me happy and give me a good laugh 😁 Garrett I'm sure i watched one of your videos and saw a bottle of whisky in your cabinet which is made where I'm from 😁  Love you both from Scotland 😁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
1.3k dislikes? How is that even possible??? Are you guys blind?????
I’m a nurse anddd i couldnt quarantine so I am still clueless about nature or mindself and my goals and my i sleep whenever i can😭 and then i go to work at night and pray i dont catch anything.
Why do Andrew and i have the same twenty one pilots shirt
I woke up at 1pm today I relate 3:12
your singing voice is so pretty
Me and Andrew said "ugh" about the tinder notification at the same time......... You know what that means
I love this video so much. Made my day a little brighter. 💕
WE NEED A CRYSTAL METHYD AND GARRETT COLLAB 😂👌
I died To grapefruit song 😂😂
HELLO GARRET MISS U & YES this STUPID CARONA CRAZYNESS has 2 END & END NOW! 💘 ❤ U
OMG I NEVER KNEW THE NAME FOR WHY I SNEEZE WHEN I GO OUTSIDE
Please write a full Grapefruits are Green song 💓🙏🏻🙏🏻
What happens to his mice ?
That pocket Skelton has me 💀
Garrett “I’ve been respecting the corona thing, no parties I haven’t been traveling”   Also Garret *went to Washington for two months*  😅🤔
8:45 Hey that a basque figurine, i'm shoocked
U think ur quarantine is bad, i haven't ate pizza for 7 months straight, and when ur eating pizza rn, its making me hungry...  On the pizza not yo- You get my point
kinda concerning i have the same exact thought process as me cottage in Washington hum oblivion punch things try to get my friend to hang out on roof
I had the best laugh watching Garrett sing about grapefruits in August
I can never tell if his flashback are real because he’s always wearing the same clothes
Can you please record and release your song "Grapefruits Are Green In August" 🥺
THANK YOU FOR ACCIDENTALLY EXISTING 💖✨
Man's got that ADHD 3000
garrett is just college drop out version of vsauce
I'm so happy yall got together u Morgan and Andrew legit carried a good portion of my childhood
he sounded so sad when he said Andrew wasn't there on the couch
Garrett sums a lot of of Gemini’s
During the quartile, I set out to watch all of the Marvel movies in chronological order. Just finished The Avengers series. Now on to X-men.
->* Jimminy Cricket song vibes! Garret should do some super chill bedtime songs bc... some weird people listen to them...oh and bedtime stories!
Always loved Andrew and Garrett, together they are THE BEST
The only thing keeping me slightly okay during quarantine was that I bottle fed two baby rats(every two hours).  Only one survived (RIP EDDIE) but now I have 3 pet rats. This is in addition to 9 ball pythons, 1 boa constrictor, a dog, and 2 soon to be arriving tegus 😅😅. My boyfriend and I will probably be getting more ball pythons tomorrow 😅.
Idk but times going really fast for me like damn
"We are married congratulations." Another one of my favorite quotes from Garret💜
Garrets wireless piano is what I need right now
Garrett got skkkeeeeennnnyyyyy
The grapefruit song is my favorite thing
So... Garret crocheted that Yoda?
this entire video is a fever dream
It was the popcorn bowl hot tub for me <3
Garret... if I may... you are the most adorable human being ever 💖
GRAPEFRUITS ARE GREEN!!! How is no one saying anything about his voice! LIKE WHAT?!  edit: GARRETT PLAYS PIANO?!
He looks so straight ..
A youtube video I find myself returning to a lot is  "The Darkest Album I Have Ever Heard - Everywhere at The End of Time  by A Bucket of Jake. I usually find that video then end up listening to the caretaker album after,  because im just so fascinated by it!
Garrett do you have some crazy budgeting life hacks to handle all the times you take long breaks from YouTube? Or do just make so much bank each video that you don’t have to worry about budgeting in the meantime?
We have the same pregnancy pillow 😂
This guy right here makes me wanna make everyday an edventure :D
Andrew and I are birthday twins and that cures my depression 😔🤚
garrett i’m begging you please make a video about your time in washington with andrew
When you realize you have psr you just didn’t know the name for it. I sneeze so much and it’s almost when I go in and out somewhere or see something brighter ext ext.
WAIT U WERE IN WASHINGTON?????? U WERE IN MY STATE AHDHEJSKJFJRJD
This video is what I needed in life. It brought me so much joy and happiness. I love these two together, they give off such a chaotic fun energy.
I honestly love how andrew could just be amused by garrett being distracted by a dog card and just be happy. Genuine friendship right there
When he mentioned JLo and Shakiras half time show, my brain broke. In half. 2020 can go straight to hell.
*Stares at andrew intensely while singing about green grapefruits*
This duo is amazing
Oh Garrett u are a goofy fun dude! Be safe and keep lovin life!
I've been getting back into drawing and painting to feel better! Love you and all your videos a tonnn!! hope you and Andrew are staying safe!
Didn't realise how much I missed Andrew too
The fact that Garrett finishes his outfit off with a pocket skeleton is everything
It was so lovely to see Girlfriend.jpeg again 🥰
I've been spending hours tending to my flower and veggie gardens, expanded my indoor plant collection by like 75% (and yes I winced when you threw the plant on the roof - it needs water!!!), and I've been taking a plant-based nutrition course cause health or something?  So happy to see you back!
The fact that you're eating pinapple pizza, make me love you even more!!!! Even our previous Garrett likes pinapple pizza! The best pizza topping!!
For some reason, Garret reminds me of Jaskier from The Witcher 😂 Just a big ol puppy dog!
A lot of stuff has happened over quarantine for me and my family, but one thing I've started doing again to help me cope with it all is collecting stickers.
1:59 SAMEEEEE (I would look at Tiktok trends that I thought were a thing like two years ago but then it says 2020 and I’m like what?!?!?!)
✨grapefruits are green in august✨
over quarantine i started exercising, as well as talking to my boyfriend constantly :>
Your doll is sold out 😢
I wanna know if when the lady with wine intrjects- if that’s something Garrett does in real time, or if it’s done later. Also, Garrett, I think you’re awesome!
I’ve started to watch YouTube again I used to but stopped for like a year and only watched Netflix but YouTube is just funnier
I’ve become obsessed with Harry styles and one direction and I couldn’t be happier
I’ve started to learn ukulele I also did loads of research on music from the 60s-90s
Finally after couple month
Five months. Well it was worth it, I have to say I relate
This made me laugh. I missed seeing you all the time!
riding my bike around
i love garrett🥺
imagine if him and Matthew Gray Gubler were friends 😌that’d be so dope and interesting haha
I need more Garrett videos to binge ❤️
funny timestamps enjoy 3:33 4:52 6:50 15:03 17:34 21:44 26:37 28:26 29:58 31:29 32:18 33:14 34:14
Crying, going for walks
Thank you for only creating happiness in your content, you as a human being is so relieving. 💗 I know you’re just behind a screen acting, but still. I’d like to think this is who you are always
Do you live with andrew
Garrett and Andrew are our gods for 2020
I've been making tik toks! It's a way for me to be creative that has less pressure than making a full Youtube video. Plus I've made several friends through the app who I call and talk to regularly! <3
Is Garrett like this irl or just in his videos? I can’t .
29:25 “what does that mean”
WE NEED A FULL SONG OF GRAPE FRUITS ARE GREEN IN AUGUST~
Yay Garrett's back. So glad, u are hilarious
Please make a video about your time in Washington
I’m slowly but surly falling in love with you me watts!❤️😍
1:36 my immediate  thought is Kronos
This really do be hitting better than any antidepressant I've been on. Please keep making videos
Fire and Air signs belong together.  THE ENERGY 🌪
Why are we the same person, Garrett?
Garret: Do you ever just not feel comfortable in your own skin? Me:(The person who has been hiding from his homophobic parents the fact that he's gay) Always.
Watching movies
bruh it feels like they parodied shanes behavior on the Chair during the sweater bit lmaooo
A TO YOUR Q: I have been doing a lot of skincare and I also have turned vegan :). Also, started giving private lessons for extra money (I am a student living w my mom bc of quarantine).
Over quarantine something I've done to feel better is paint small dinosaurs. I'm not kidding! Mostly flat wooden ones, but a couple of figures. I've literally painted over 100 it's becoming a bad collection of dinosaurs with distorted faces. (send help)
Please do the night in your life. please.
When Garrett fake  cried about what he wanted for breakfast my heart broke. Then when it showed him with the cake I got all happy again and raved together while I was eating ramen with my chopsticks ;;
Please Garret, buy a ladder....
A night in my life!
Where can I download "grapefruits are green" where Andrew also gets interrupted by Garretts singing louder. I need it like that specifically
*noticing text time stamp and narrative time don’t match* 😱😱
What I did to feel better in quarantine was smoke a lot of weed and play video games 😄
All I want to do now is climb out of my windows, but I live in trailers and my family wouldn't let me climb out of their cars again.
Check your walls for mold.  Stop eating sushi.  Animal infestation.  A continuous spider biting you? Maybe your gay painting were painted with shit?
Its so cute that you and pixielocks use the same kawaii background music lol
Grapefruits Are Green In August by Garrett Watts
DANN, YOUR CHANNEL HAS TAKEN OFF! THAT'S GREAT I LOVE YOU!
I have photo sneeze reflex too!!! omg
I like how I’ve seen comments saying Garrett’s like that cool science or math teacher. He seems like a history one to me because he loves showing random artifacts in and around his home and giving them back stories with some thoroughly full details. It’s honestly the sweetest 🥺♥️ didn’t he say he‘s bad at math in some other video too?
Be  careful with the plates in the microwave because of the gold rim, make sure it's not foil
His stuff is definitely still on that roof
Andrew yelling “There’s a lemon!” Is so cute 😭😭
I also have the sneeze thing. Happens at least a few times every day for mz
I would pick cake too!
whatever happend to him and shane..? and also I wonder how he feels about shane at the moment....... i love garrett though he's so sweet and funny and happy and he deserves to be happy
Watching Garrett garretting sparks joy in my heart
Garrett singing singing about grapefruit being green in august is me me asf 😂😂😂
i need Grapefruits are green in August on itunes.
Garrett you should do a video with Drew & Shane I miss all y’all ☹️💔
I really want Andrew and Garrett to make a podcast together, that would be the best
garrett’s vebrato’s are magnificent
Do you think Garett’s neighbors ever worry about him? Like can you imagine looking out ur window and seeing two grown men on a roof... one playing a keyboard and one filming the other one..... hahah
I've missed seeing ur videos sm 🥺 I'm glad ur taking care of urself & not pushing urself to post, but I am so happy to see u on yt again 💕
Ahhh my quarantine has consisted of Playing a butt tonne of games with people, learning the guitar and taking up coding ohhh and I forgot self loathing
Mann I miss you so much
To state the obvious, Garrett and Andrew are friendship goals.
I'm convinced Garrett has like ADHD at like the highest level possible
I know you were joking around, but this actually WAS really inspiring. Determined to try more too now.
I’m a man and I sleep with my 2m pregnancy pillow (bolster)..it calms me down and it can stimulate better sleeping pattern and quality
I've being learning french lol
Stream grapefruits are green in august on spotify
Missyouuu, garett
No music to recommend but I love you!
OMG ANDREW AND I HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY XD, btw i love you both and i missed you so much <3
Love that I can still enjoy Andrews laughter. ❤️❤️ you Garrett
I love these two
Lol the grapefruit song. Also, pretty good voice actually!
Lol, I knew you were gonna eat that cake. I would too. Watching you wait for us to choose an answer had me cracking up. You're too funny and way too adorable. So glad to see videos from you again!
What I do to make myself feel better is go to bed, because I usually fall asleep at 2am...
I love you guys so much
28:02 - Protect this precious being at all cost.
Gardening, I grew my own sunflowers and raspberries this year. Also gardening means that I find alot of cool bugs, I found a eagle eyed moth caterpillar and cool weavle beetles :)
I haven't laughed out loud in a long time, especially this much, so much thanks 🙏🙏🙏
Garrett never change.. we need more people like you and Andrew in this world
"That's not called looking, that's called inspiring." Now that's optimism at its finest.
Garret seems to find the joy in everything and I wish I could be like that SO MUCH 😭💕💕
I think Shane took a lot of humor and mannerisms from Garrett, looking forward to seeing more of Garett’s content.
@13:24 He's like a sad puppy I feel soo baaad I wanna cuddle him!!
I don't know how often you check you comments, Garret, but I hope you see this. My fiance and I have been watching your channel for at least a couple years now and when we saw this video today we absolutely lost our shit at the "Grapefruits are Green" song. I'm not joking, my fiance legit just finished making their rendition of it in recording and we really want to show it to you but we're not sure where or how. You're chaotic and we love your energy lol.
Go get Shane. I miss u all together 😢❤️
i love andrew  bye
Well, me and my boyfriend live 2 mins away from each other. At first, we just played online games, watched a lot of Netflix, and now, I cook a native Filipino dessert known only in my province. I started to sell in online, and bam, now me and my boyfriend owns a small business. It has only been two months. Yeah, it makes us both productive, and we deliver everything for free using our bikes. Hehe. Makes quarantine great.
please please please make a night in my life
i have a morning sneeze too😌
we definitely need a night in my life
I do that sneeze thing too
Missed you Garrett and Andrew!! During Quarantine to make myself feel better I started with meditation, walking & biking, and learning ukulele so I can sing for friends and family. Since most have cried I think I'm doing okay.... or their ears are bleeding? but I like to think doing okay is the real answer <3
andrew sounds like the rat from ratatouille 26:58 lol
me at 3am:
OMG I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT ITS CALLED WHEN THE SUN MAKES ME SNEEZE
Ugh I love how connected Garret is to his inner child. His energy reminds me of childhood and I need that shit.
Why did Garrett literally turn into tiny tim in this?
Andrew being amazed by the bunny in the backyard was probably my most favorite part of this video. Aww
I need to see a night in my life, if I had the choice I would be a night owl but starbucks be wilding. Waking up at 3 to be at work by 4 am is rougggggggghhhhhhh. So please thank your starbucks baristas
This quarantine I have been taking care of my bunnies & reading lots of books 😊 Taking a step away from screens has really helped me in this crazy time😊
Is no one going to talk about how impressive Garrett spinning that stick was? (6:23)
Garrett I would like to help you 🥺
I hope one day garret get together with the lady in the picture.
c r o w s h a y
*stares blankly at the intro on my work computer while having an absolute shitshow on my excel doc* im ~essential~
keeping in touch with my boyfriend has made everything so much better, and playing monopoly on video chat has been amazing, only one person actually needs the board. :)
Yes please do make a night time video
Even though I am late this really made my day. Love you guys
It’s the pineapple pizza for me 🍍 🍕👎🏻😂
I've been watching dr.stone
video idea: MUKBANG!!
I love your randomness so much.....I do miss you with Morgan that was hilarity.
I started hoop dancing over quarantine! Not to plug, but I have videos on my youtube channel. I want to document my process of learning more!
i have those same pizza socks and i feel so accomplished
8:22 I LOVE THIS! Where can I get this!? ❤️
I wish I was Garrett’s neighbor
I need more vlogs by the two of you!! Please!
Garret your personality is so uplifting and you radiate so much joy and it makes me so happy I just want you to know that 🥺😊🥰
THIS IS FOR EVERYONE IN AMERICA! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽💃🕺
New title: Garrett becoming me
i love watching u, but i wont lie sometimes i gotta change the speed and make it slower
Garrett you are an AMAZING person! 💕💕💕
If you want to talk to more ghosts use nercophonic. It’s on the App Store for 10 dollars I think but it actually works. Check out Kelsi Davies’ newer vids using the app, it’s very cool
If Garrett were straight... And I were straight... We'd make a great couple 😂
I FORGOT HOW AMAZING THE GARRET WATTS SHOW IS
Maybe try adhd meds 😂
9:47, is he wearing a watch in the shower?
god i love him
Shanes probably shaking his head watching this but I'm here for it
I mean I've been on YouTube and tictoc during quarantine
Yessss ghost content! You literally inspired me and my friends to start ghost hunting! We’ve captured some crazy stuff so far!
"grapefruits are green in August" is a bop
I have the sneeze reflex too!!!! People think I’m crazy when I’m like “hang on I gotta sneeze” and then stare at the sun or a bright light 😂😂😂
Whoever gets to marry Garret one day is the luckiest. He's definition adorable.
Don't microwave those plates. For a start. One has a gilt edge.... I. E. Sparky sparky Garett.
Sleeping with a sword is the most 2020 thing I have ever heard
everytime I hear Andrew „Seeweekee” I need to tell him how to pronounce his name correctly in Polish;)
omg I didnt know sun sneezes were a thing that happened to other people!!!!!! i relate wayyyyyy too much
when he said the jlo and shakira half time show in 2018 i was like yeah i rember that lol
This video was 2 weeks ago? Jesus...
MY FRIENDS HAVE ALWAYS MADE FUN OF ME FOR SNEEZING WHEN ITS BRIGHT OUTSIDE BUT NOW I KNOW ITS A THING THANK U
Yes a night in your life
its the showering while wearing a watch for me
Time has DEFINITELY been weird but I thought it was just cause I’ve been high as a mf since quarantine started
Congratulations on the marriage
why do i want them to get married tho?????? hmmmmmm
I need to see Garrett Watts and Mike Tyson together.  Garrett doesn't even have to smoke on hotboxin'.  Although it's probably better for everyone in Mike Tysons orbit of he does.  I know it would be a strange match but it could be magic or a nightmare.  No in between
I sleep with a knife totally understand
I’ve been watching greys anatomy!
Oh my god South Harmon!  Yauzah.
omg I lost it when he started singing about green grapefruits. hahahhahahahahhahahahaha
We need more of you two!😁
24:23 he spelt crochet wrong. Was it on purpose? Idk
I think the only 40 minuet day in the life video I could watch all the way through is Garrett’s 🙌
Dear baby Jesus.  Never let anything bad happen to this man. He’s freaking precious and needs to be protected at all costs.  And Benjamin too.   Amen.  🤗
i love you guys so much :( this video has made me genuinely happy for the first time in months 🧡
PLS POST THE MINI VIDS FROM WASHINGTON!!!!!
Did garret call Andrew a simp lmao
26:37 W H E E Z E HELP IM CRYING
https://youtu.be/6sgpeoWpO9w How Light Reflects differently on face. Beautifully made  enjoy. Keep up to good work, dork.
I’m surprised he hasn’t been playing Animal Crossing New Horizons. It’s perfect for passing by time and it’s so cute and fun and positive! It’s literally perfect for Garrett lol also, I’ve been playing it since early May haha
I love Dragon Ball Z so much so I loved the random DBZ boxers moment lol
Andrew and Garrett really have the energy of the best old married couple and I love every second of it ❤️
I live for this omg
I got the sneezy weezy sunshine thingy too... iam very high
DAMMIT WATTS
I paused the video to say this...please dont eat the birthday cake Garrett
garrett is art from monsters inc. university 17:35 but also just in general
u really got me with the jlo and shakira thing
Stop wearing your watch in the shower, good lord.
Ah, now this is the kind of content 2020 needed
Andrew is soo cute
ok but what book did you read about organization cuz I need it
Garrett is literally what it's like in my adhd mind all day.
Yes I would love to watch a night in your life! Lol
Wait. So why are Garrett and Shane no longer speaking?
Garrett is a countertenor
I died of laughter so many times while watching this video 😂😂
Garrett don’t worry no one going to steal your snow globes
I'm not even old enough to have youtube and iknow what mortgage means😳
Milk and vodka😂😂😂😂
Over a DND session, I decided to move to a new city with some of my best friends. Now we live together in a studying, snacking, quarantine hovel and I wouldn't have it any other way.
can you like make a day in my life video like series w andrew
Where can I best friend or lover that is exactly like Garrett😭😭😭😭😻😻
Garrett is so cute.
I seen those Kiva chocolate covered edibles in the fridge there 👀👀👀👀 I’ve worked in the industry far too long now to not notice or recognize those babies.
Wait it's been only 5 months?but like time is nothing now
Why did his texts say 12:20 but Andrew said 3pm-  12 AM btw
Garrett, your voice is utterly stunning. I need an album pls. The sillier the better. 2020 needs it 🥺😍
Garrett’s singing is absolutelyyyyyyy stunning ✨🥺🤎
I missed your videos dude, I fucking love them
Bring back *Will it combo?* or else (unless you do not want to, if so it's okay)!
I talk to a spider that lives in my window that I named lucas (:
i think that he has ADHD
get a pot baby..💘
Garret: *talking about something he and Andrew can do together* Andrew who has been quarantined with garret for 5 months: you act like we live together Garret: We're MARRIED Andrew!!! CONGRADUATIONS   I'm losing it XD lmao
3 more months to go 🗓 ps my time.................Exactly there is no time at some point we just call it a new day
I dont care if I get anything for my birthday I just want a happy birthday from Andrew or Garrett or both or just from anyone
your chaotic energy is all i will ever need
I love how Andrew laughs at garrett's  jokes and all around supports him In everything he does instead of making fun of him and putting him down
what makes me feel good during this time is watching new shows on netflix because when I only rewatch stuff I fall into a deeper depression so instead I've been trying new shows, newest one was Umbrella Academy and it was good!!
Me and Andrew have the same birthday !🎂🎉
Honestly laughed more during this video than I have all year. Thank you Garret 💖
Did anyone else peep the edibles in garrett's fridge? 😂
Garrett can sing?
You're my favorite channel! So I guess rewatch your videos!! hee hee hee!!  Happy Halloween By The Way! Spooky season begins! Halloween crow goo! Goooooo!!
Grapefruits are grrreeeeeeeen in augusssttttttttt grape fruits are GRRRRRREEEEENNNNNN in August grape fruits are greeeen in Augustttttt......August the grapefruits are greeeeen
I was actually able to keep working But i did a lot of flowarts i think you Would find that a super cool hobbie you should check it out, you can play with lights and fire etc
Taking care of my 10 month old has been keeping me occupied during quarantine 😝
playing Magic the Gathering, Commander format 🙂
did anyone else sneeze after garret showed his sneeze?
They said the world Would end in 2012 but it didnt, so we thaught. There is a calender called the Maya calender wich exists out of 13 cycles (also called b'ak'tuns) wich takes each 394 year. On 21 of december 2012 the 13th b'ak'tun ends and they hope the cycle starts all over again. For us its 2020 But in the Maya callender is in 2012 right now, so maybe the world does end this year
The fact that you throw the golden girls pillow hurt my heart because I want one so bad 😭 I’m buying my home out of pocket and struggling mentally and physically so I hope I when it’s done I can find me one
🎹🎵𝒚𝒆𝒔🎵🎹
The pot baby and his judgmental friends... I'm in the right state of mind to pick up on that.
I live in WA and I find it rude that you didn't invite me to say hi from 6 ft away
I got cats back in March literally right before everything started to shut down and I’m so happy I did they’re sisters , the last two black cats from the original litter that came in at the shelter (they’re names are tink and bell so my partner and I like to joke that the other cats were most likely named Peter and pan ) they’re older cats so they’re more cuddly than playful which is exactly what I needed in my life right then they’re the best emotional support animals when I get extremely overwhelmed they’ll come up and cuddle me and just having to get up and feed them and change the litter and small things like that give my life a little more structure cause even pre Rona I feel like I was isolating myself in my depression mess
Psr me and my sister have it too!!!!!
to feel better over quarantine i've been rewatching my favorite youtube videos ( this includes your tiny house tour )
MELATONIN gets you to sleep naturally, efficiently, I put a hamburger outside, I put a laundry basket above it, I put a string on the laundry basket, the melatonin's in the  h a m b u r g e r, he eats the hamburger, he falls fast asleep, I sneak up on him with the sweater, I slip it on his paws, he's comfortable he's LOVING it, he's showing it off to his friends, he's THANKING me, he's congratulating me for being a good boi...... and you don't recognize that?
31:29 me when I get my own place
30:31  me when i do something on my own for the first time like ordering pizza and im proud of myself😭
re: the time distortion. lol welcome to ME. sorry world
GARRET how did you HIT THOSE NOTES
It’s ridiculous how funny Garret is
2020 Hit Different...
am i the only oun lookte at my play back speed
DO YOU HEAR A SPIDER?!?
Just putting it out there, nobody would complain if u just did a 2 hour video of you and Andrew just hanging out all day with no actual plot
I DO THE SUN SNEEZE THING! I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS LIKE A THING THING, I JUST THOUGHT ITWAS SOMETHING I DO!! THANKS GARRETT
The only channel that I always watch the promo section🙏🏻
I felt like I was going to have a panic attack and my first thought was Garretts video and I just want to say thank you so much for being you
Before I learned about Garret´s existence I would be really freaked out if a guy has little dolls everywhere, but now I think I would understand
I love how Garret always runs away from his own jokes 😂
I can’t tell if it’s been so long since watching Garrett that I’m not used to his antics or if quarantine has driven him a little insane. Could be both
I saved chumbacca. That's my real last name.
Do more videos.  I dig these long random and fun videos. Helps my mood. Your awesome. Please continue doing these and do a night in my life!!! Yay
Teach me your sorcery ! You beckon of light.
I’ll FaceTime my friends in order to have something to constantly keep my brain focused while I do an art project, or part of one. Cus without someone to talk to my brain gets easily distracted.
wait!!! is that Drew on 5:58?? i didnt know andrew and drew even met each other
South Harmon Graduate teach me your sorcery!
Garrett:oh no I got a stain of my sword!! Me:yeah a blood stain😆
yes please do a night in your life
Your videos give me anxiety with everything going on in warp speed lmao but I live live live for them. And I love me some andrew
Seeing just how many things Garrett has honestly stresses me out but we still love him regardless.
This is top tier content to watch after you have dabbled with the Devil's Lettuce - let me tell ya.
Garrett said "imma jump out the window like Scott Pilgrim" because honestly, who doesn't wanna? 😁👌
If we could just get this every day as like a vlog channel it would be OVER!! I love this so much.
That was a Jack of the Dust skull!! I love their art!! For anyone seeing this comment who likes skulls, check out their insta, it's amazing
Hey look at that! I do also have PSR! So yeah
Crying made me feel good lol
I'm very high and the first 2 minutes are already too much for me 😂
Garret those fancy plates are used for decoration...
Hi Garrett! What's been keeping me busy during quarantine is work. I finally got my first job this year, and it's where I've met my best friend. I've always been a quiet person so making friends has been hard, but getting to know this person has been honestly life changing for the better and I still can't believe we've formed the bond we have. For the first time I can be my total self around someone and have them love me fully without condition. So that's what's been keeping me happy! 💛 I hope everything is well in the little Watts Household
I haven’t laughed this hard in months thank you
I knit some blankets for my pups, and now I'm trying to knit my dog Piglet a sweater
Garrett you are a bright shining gem! <3 be well. Thanks for sharing your light with us, all best to you!
19:04 Oop, great taste spotted.
I can relate to that morning sneeze
What even is Andrew's life
The way he says ‘ya, so basically, strawberries are grapefruits, just a month earlier! *lip smack* *giggle insanely* *lip smack*
SO WE WANNA SEE THAT WASHINGTON TRIP
They bicker like an old married couple
Good lord this entire video made me laugh!
Omg my 3 year old sneezes at the sun too!
Your speaking cadence and tone sounds like you're a character from Letterkenny!
Oh my gosh, I freaking love Garrett! I would hangout with Garrett and Andrew anytime! Singing grapefruits and Andrew laughing made my day better haha
I'm not even 5 minutes into this video and I'm already crying- laughing...the pregnancy pillow!😂 I love you Garrett! (& Andrew) 🖖💚
Okay but I love Garrett’s house so much
Thank you for this Video!! :)
do you watch the anime Hunter x Hunter?
i am a baby... this is the remix 🎶
Can I be Garrett watt's when I grow up
2020 feels so short yet soooo long like how is it already 4 months left but also wtf happened this year
Night in my life?!? Hell yes! I love ya man and I love joining in on the craziness that is a Garrett night!
andrew is the cutest omg
I’m a sun sneezer too! I sneeze two times every time I go into the sun 🌞 my dog barks and jumps on me when I sneeze tho…
My theory is that it’s election year and China was trying to screw with us since they DO NOT like us rn. They meant for it to hit the states and that’s all but it got way out of control. Since it’s man made I’m sure they have a vaccine for it but they can’t admit it so they had to let it run it’s course.
The Spike Spiegel figure in the background?? Iconic we LOVEEE
To feel better in quarantine I’ve been adopting cats! I have four now :D
Garret is just a big baby.
I have been watching more and different types of animes, that has for sure helped me out with this Quarantine along with also going swimming and getting back into reading which I have loved since a kid but lost sight of. Glad to be back reading though I have missed it
I’ve missed you so  I actually think it’s the aliens , like in Star Trek , they’re testing us , before they let us in the Federation and I think we’ve failed (behaviours haven’t been great ) Yeah I’m so fucked too
you guys don't have fly screens on your windows???
I need grapefruit the musical
This was sooo cute  Please! You better do a night video! 🥰
Garrett, you are so fucking cute and your troll body is gorgeous!  You have no idea what a daddy you are, do you?
Yesss we need a night in the life of Garrett Watts
“but this morning there’s no andrew”🥺🥺
5:48 that "huuu" is me in the morning.
The best friendship ever!❤️
I’ve been running in the am since quarantine. Still working as well.
5:19 it's the scream for me<3
Garrett you are so frikin fun! Love you so much 😍
Garrett I love you but you need to get your shit together
The photic sneeze reflex huh- I didn't know there was a name for it
NIGHT OF MY LIFE
26:58 Andrew sounds like Remy from ratatouille LMAO
I’m gonna be honest these boys are my favourite on YouTube
why does Garrett remind me of an older version of Gus 😳 the smile, the voice, the personality- everything!
Yass Garrett is back and with Andrew 💕💕
I learned to watercolor and it's brought me so much joy! <3
13:30 was way funnier to me than it should have been
Hoy namiss kita!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ so glad you uploaded
I've been reading and video chatting with friends and family during quarantine to feel better :)
I think I need a snide drink sipping lady to keep me on track too
The grapefruit song killed me 💀
i relate to this so much XD <3 love the sleep explanation the most
Please make a night in my life video
Ok so like....IM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT SLEEPS WITH A SWORD 😃👍
you two are like an old married couple! HAHA!
“Grapefruits Are Green In August” Garrett’s new single hopefully
I HAVE PRS TOOOOO OMG it’s pretty cool cuz if i feel like i have to sneeze but it fakes me out i can simply force it 😌
Did you know coco went to target 😂
It's only meant to be called "Quartine" if someone in the home has COVID. It's actually just social distancing. Read a news article about it. No shade just thought I would say something. LOVE your videos so much!!! Much Love from Canada!
During this this time I've been getting closer to God
By the way in theory since the calendar was made 8 years early it's technically 2012 which was the year were the world was meant to end. There were even movies about it. Is this just a coincidence or was Covid meant to happen, causing many people to pass away. Maybe Covid was meant to extinct all man kind.
I ship Garrett and Andrew
Why is no one talking about the cereal in the fridge
At many points in this video Garrett is giving off major Jack D Grazer in V-team 2 vibes
I took a gap year the year before and I have no idea what day it's been since 2018
I just wanna clean Garrett's house lmao
Question answer = I hang out on my roof 2
I HAVE A PHOTIC SNEEZE REFLEX TOO! SUCK IT PEOPLE WHO SAID THE SUN DOESN'T WIELD SNEEZY POWERS
Oh my god NOW I KNOW WHY GARRET HAS SUCH BAD EYE SIGHT. ITS BECAUSE HE STARES AT THE SUN (don't worry I have bad eyes to, I got my eyes checked for the very first time in 2016-2017 turns out I'm awful at doing most thing without glasses and I cant see about 5ft in front of me maybe a bit further but I cant see my rad pokemon posters on the wall without them because its all blurry)
the world might be ending soon but i still want to live in a small house with all my trinkets, odd furniture, books, random gadgets and friends like garrett
This is very random but where in Washington where you bc I live I'm Washington
Garret and Andrew’s combined energy is the cure for the Coronavirus!!
I’m so glad you’re back, Garrett! I love you! 💕💕💕
When the music cuts as he turns toward the fort... I cried
Garrett & Andrew. i love you
They are having a gay affair
Every single second of every single video I see of you overwhelms my heart with love and joy
I’d watch a night I’m my life video
Do you have a PO Box???
Garret actually cures my depression ❤️
"this was a broken broom that I have and I never have the heart to throw it away" "The heart??" "iT wAs mY fIrSt bRoOm" 😂😂😂 this is 100% me and my spouse LMAOO (they're the one who hoards the silliest things with all these hyperspecific backstories. I'm endlessly entertained by it. I'll go to throw out something that appears to be garbage and my spouse is just NOOOOO THAT'S MY SPECIAL PIECE OF GARBAGE)
the squirrel knit fight was like a TLC show
ok but i didn't realize how much i missed hearing andrews laugh!! behind the cam!
I’m an introvert so to make this time I do what I normally do lol but really I hang out with my cat!
i live in washington state, glad they liked it here confused why they went here. its not very cool here atleast to me idk wht city they went to
I wonder how's drew monson doing. Imean just seing garret eating pizza and playing piano does really remind me of him.   But the video really made my day!
Ayyyyeee I live in Washington! What town did you guys stay in?
Baking bread while I vibe with my homies on discord! My roommates are my sister and brother so we all vibe a lot
But Garrett, what if someone breaks into your bathroom, takes your bathroom sword, and runs to your room? Are you ready for that sword battle, are you?
👻👻👻👻
20:28
I missed you so much. Seeing a night in your life would be great!
I have bad anger issues and I love garrett so much he calms me makes me smile and truly brightens my life
I am so excited your the best
Garrett sounds like he could have actually been in Les Misérables when he sings.
You have the most beautiful voice I’ve ever heard
I always love watching old lesbians
matthew gray gubler and garrett would be great friends i think
the one thing i learned from this is that i have PSR-thank you i have been wondering if i was allergic to the sun my whole life but i have been en-light-ened. (ew i just made myself gag with that one whatever)
I need Garrett and Andrew to be my friend 😭 I love their friendship ! I love both of y’all 🥺 Garrett is so adorable
Cocaine is a hell of a drug...
i fall asleep at 6 am and wake up at 3pm like everyday 😔
I would marry Garrett platonically, I love him so much, what a friendly ray of sunshine 🌞
This was exceedingly entertaining. Thank you
Man I'm living for the "Grapefruits are green in August" song hahahahaha
I HAVE PSR too and every time I explain it they look at me crazy I'm so glad im not the only one, also luv you.
14:32 The best song
I’ve been going all out on a greys anatomy binge so I’m only just watching this. Bug let me tell you, I bought mini garret so fast when it came out and if I’m lucky enough to get a bug drawing I will literally get that special little bug tattooed!
I mean....they are pretty much married lol PS we need Andrew shirtless ok that’s all :)
Sometimes I just want to eat pizza with my friends but I eat an entire pizza everytime I get it so y'know that doesnt work
Hi! I actually reconnected with my online friends I met over 4 years ago during quarantine! Now we chat everyday, often voice chat and play games together! Im really happy to have my best friends back.
why does garret in the shower look like my ex
The fact that your merch is a figurine is so on brand
You and Andrew should just live together and post infinite videos.
Night in ur life plssss
I have psr too and so does my dad and most of my siblings x
Love it. For a second I considered strawberries being baby grapefruits, lmfao. I bought a new bike and ride everyday now. I've also fixed a bunch of little and big things on my car. Replaced strut assemblies. Rebuilt calipers. New disc brakes. New drum brakes. New rotors. I also wound up building a new computer. I like having a project. Especially one that is kind of like going to work. Something that can occupy the meat of the day after the morning wake-up routine and before the nightly wind-down routine. Syncing up with the day helps big-time. I struggle with wacky schedules myself. That, and zoom calls with family and groups.
The pregnancy pillow LOL
To feel better during quarantine, I've started watching anime. Just completed Black Clover; no regrets.
Sleeping with a sword isn't weird I sleep with two knifes under my pillow
ive been riding my bike alot and hanging out with my friewnds and stuff
Andrew sleeping on garretts couch with a yoda plushie
Wait?? The sun making you sneeze is a real thing?? I thought I was crazy! I would say that I’m allergic to the sun or something bc it makes me sneeze. And now if I have to sneeze I can’t get the sneeze out unless I stare into some kind of light lol
I'm lucky pre pandemic I was a hermit and insomniac. Wait..hasn't changed
Garret is this child that I must protect
Garret and Andrew rlly said fuck toxic masculinity and went to a cottage together for a while 😭 I love them 🥺💞💞✨✨
I don't mean to be a party pooper but ur playing loud music in the middle of the night, and the school has started for most kids;-; some kid's not gonna get a good grade in the morning ...
I took up embroidery in quarantine and made some really cute pillowcases!
Oh man, Garrett is a hoot.
I've been adopting so many plants. One might even say too many plants. That and painting. Oh, and also playing with my guinea pigs.
I've been adopting so many plants. One might even say too many plants. That and painting. Oh, and also playing with my guinea pigs.
Preach about the sneezing.. I wake myself up out of a dream from a sneeze
GARRETT I HAVE A PHOTIC SNEEZE REFLEX TOO!
The fact that this was upload a week ago but it’s felt like a month rly proves his point
Watching you sneeze, I now realize the level of pandemic in the US makes so much sense now
Garrett: I got a tinder notification. Andrew: ahhgh
Wish I had friends to spend quarantine with 😂 But love this
I have that exact same ghost its actually a heating pad 😂😂😂
During quarantine, I’ve been getting into Kpop :)  BTS AND VICTON!!!
to answer the end question: i started making art again during quarantine!!! :)   also i absolutely loved this video it was so fun!!
PRAYING I get one of those little drawing things in my figure. Also what I’ve been doing over quarantine was decorating my room. And also finding myself in clothing I like. Basically finding myself!!!!
A toonz is absolutely the perfect thing to promote as it is literally you miniaturized, hanging out with all the little friends you've collected.
OMG I HAVE THAT PILLOW TOO!
THE RACCOON PICTURE that was in my city omg 😂😂😂
the picture of myrtle snow from ahs ugh iconic !
Painting for the first time since school!(10yrs ago), baking & I started watching Naruto 🙂
I love that they're dating, but not really, but they are, but not really, bUT
"Grapefruits are green in August" is literally everything I needed from life.
I’m just watching this, a week late, relieved I’m not the only one losing it. I’ve been stuck at home since February & waking up before noon is like wooooo
i want a bug picture :(
I feel like Garrett and iDubbbz should do a squirrel collab video
we love seeing Garret putting his sonic screwdriver to good use
Does garrett have adhd?
I've been feeling better by befriending the moths that happen to enter my room :')
This sounds literally so stupid and cringy, but to help me feel better through the quarantine was writing and then when my quarantine ended, I had to go back to work. But I've been writing songs since I was younger and have wanted to be the singer for a band for SOOOO long, and emerging from quarantine with new lyrical inspiration made me realise that I CAN follow my dreams, and its up to me to make sure that I do
YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE ME HAPPY STOP IT
i watched all the marvel movies in chronological order! wonderful time and a good thing to cry at :-)
I hang out with my dogs and cats a lot during quarantine that makes me feel better. I also did get some pet snails :) their names are Larry, Turbo, Shellisa, and Snowball. I love them very much and they are extremely cute. I also made a long list of movies I have not seen but have always wanted to and basically just had a ton of movie nights!
Watching 80s movies, painting, and shopping.
To feel better about quarantine I’ve just been watching YouTube
Thank you for helping me prove to my husband that sneezing when walking out into the sun is a real thing! P.S. I’m part of the 18% ☺️😂
“We are married...congratulations” (nosebleed) X_X
I hope Gracie didn't scream at him :(
5:57 DREWWWW MY HEART- 🥺🥺🥺 BRING HIM ON HEREEE
Did you hear a spider 🕷😂
Was the rain at the beginning real
I’ve been playing Animal Crossing lol
THIS IS MY DAMN SQUIRREL SWEATER
Garrett doesn't post often but damn, his content is energetic and wholesome, it's worth it every time. Also, Andrew and Garrett are such a power duo, I love them
I blinked and it went from extended spring break to zoom being the norm, yet the super bowl and the whole iran missile thing seems so long ago. Time is no longer reliably perceived...       Or is it?  *vsauce music*  No, it is, and time is all over the place and this year is definitely going to have similar effects on society that September 11th did.  Oh, okay. Well then.   As always, thanks for watching.
Not to sound mean, but how do you earn money
I didn’t realize how much I missed the wine glass stock photo lady
DID YOU JUST SHOWER WITH YOUR WATCH ON YOUR HAND GARRETT??!!
I SNEEZE TOOOO:P
Playing Animal crossing New Horizon
Had to check my playback speed
I hope Garrett, Andrew, and Morgan will always be friends.
do not watch garrett when you are high my mind is fucking racing even fast than usual and i'm dizzy garrett pls help
If I can’t get friends with the same vibes and chaotic energy as Garret and Andrew then I don’t want any
ive been making friendship bracelets :)
I have missesd you both so much. Great to realize I am not the only person who perceives life in 2020 this way. Yeah you are back. Smudge my cat has been missing you too xx
I need the night in my life
garrett PLEASE can your glasses THEY ARE PAINFULLY DIRTY
see you in another 6 months :,)
I loved this video...just going to rewatch it for three months to the next video comes up🖤
Moviesssssssssss!
Night in your life. Yay!👍👍👍👍👍
He hasnt posted in so long I thought he was probably dead
I REALLY need Garrett to meet the wine glass girl in real life.
The golden girls pillow though 😂
Not Andrew sleeping wiff a baby yoda ahhh hes the cutest <3
As someone with raging ADHD I appreciate and relate to this video so much😂❤️
I have PSR too!! It happens every time I go outside
At least Andrew's still hot. So much has changed in 2020, some small consistencies make a big difference these days.
Garrett you're vibrato is STUNNING
I’ve just been gating ready for school 😑 and nothing else
Something I've been doing over quarantine to make myself feel good/better is watching old horror movies! I rewatched The Amityville Horror (1979) last night and I feel amazing. (^_^)
Is it just me or does Garett give off the fun science teacher vibe?
Garretts sneeze made me sneeze👉🏼👈🏼
OMG I HAVE PSR TOO I NEVER KNEW THERE WAS A TERM🥺
I am not 1 bit ashamed to admit that I found this video highly enjoyable and I miss you Garret ☺️
Thank you for this. I feel like I just experienced hearing what a golden retriever's thought process would be through this video lmao
PLEASE DO A NIGHT IN MY LIFE  and to answer ur question no joke just binge watching ur videos and watching anastasia on Broadway 😌🤚
WHERE CAN I BUY THE CD PLAYER
39 minutes of pure, unadulterated joy. I really needed that.
I got a chicken during quarantine🤣
If ADHD was a person :
this is the first video in AGES that has made me laugh out loud, I love you so much Garrett!!!
Omg. I remember the time I mentioned something in passing about the sun makes you sneeze and him looking at me like ibwas nuts. I gad no idea not everyone has this and he had no idea it was a thing.
~things I did over quarantine~ -binged watched My Hero Academia (all four seasons) -^^^ also read the manga - Developed a taste for teas (jasmine green tea is my favorite) - Learned Morse code.
GHOST CONTENT GHOST CONTENT GHOST CONTENT!!!!!!!!!!!
ahhh I missed stock photo lady😌
The sonic movie happened this year.
Hi garret welcome back uwu
Garrett is soo underrated! His humor, energy, video ideas, editing,  randomness, love of tiny things(and the most random things) wholesomeness etc...  is 👌🏻  I always get excited when I see he uploaded a new video.. especially since that’s only a couple-few times a year.   Never change Garrett, stay true to yourself. I’d love to have a friend like him.
I’m sure your watch is waterproof but when I saw it in the shower I was getting so stressed for some reason lol
My new plates *throws chair, runs
GARRETT IS A *B E A N* much love.
I got my dog about three years ago and he's nothing like what we were expecting. He's really excitable and takes a lot to get to listen. In all honesty we weren't ready for another pet, especially one like him that wouldn't just chill out. We tried to find someone else who would be a better family for him and failed quite a few times, but I'm really glad about that. Even before quarantine my mental health was low and rapidly crashing, so it's the worse it's ever been at the moment. Anyways, point is that during quarantine I've been spending every day with him and I think we're both a little happier thanks to that. I love Rocko, he's my little buddy and even though he doesn't like to listen very well he's the one thing that hasn't changed constantly and hasn't caused me any worry. Love you boy :)
<3
Hey Garrett! Do you think i could get that lil bug and the writing tattooed?? I just wanna get permission from the artist before getting it done 👉👈😊
wait but i love ur hp shirt
Still no mention of blm? No link to a petition no tweet no post?
oh Andrew, come to Italy (after quarantine lol) and you will realize Pizza Hut is crap :D  also: yes, we want a night in your life Garett!! <3
CAN YOU PLEASE DO A CROCHET VIDEO
GIVE ME YOUR COWBOY BEBOP MUG NOW
"A man never forgets his first broom"  Okay, Harry Potter.
Omg u did not crochet that 🤣
GARRETT I USED TO HAVE THAT EXACT BEAR PLATE WTF 23:08
Garret is such a baddie
garrett, just thank you for being you. you help so many people and you're such a genuine person. i hope you're currently doing great :)
I NEEDED THIS
Garrett>Shane
The intro was too real! "How can the days feel so short and the year feel so long?" LMAO!
I would like a piece of pizza, please.
garret may be my favorite person ever
😂😂😂 I think those are decorative plates and not actual dinner plates 😂😂😂
I spent most of my quarantine screaming into the void
Does he make like 1 video every 6 months to earn enough money to pay his bills for the next 6 months? If so...Bravo!
its the trolls blanket for me <3
im only a couple minutes in and i just want to comment that i literally work for a mortgage protection insurance company and i dont even really know what mortgage means so you're not alone
I love you thank you for this serotonin
Not sponsored by Concerta.
WAIT ANDREW IS HIS CAMERAMAN OMG IM LIVING FOR THISSSSS
He’s grandma material
My sister got two pet rats over quarantine and their names are warsaw and fez and i hang out with them to distract from life :)
this is the third time ive watched this since youve posted it & "grapefruits r green" is a such bop also ngl i literally just rewatch your videos constAntly to feel better
I genuinely don’t think I’ve ever related to anyone more than Garrett
I SWEAR you’re my spirit animal... over quarantine I’ve been literally sleeping in entirely too much, but also I’ve been catching up on tooooo many YouTube videos - wishing I was watching more of YOURS ;)
WAIT.. I thought everyone sneezed when they go in sunlight
Garret is so handsome
i saw a person and sceamd ewwww socilizing!!! and ran and hide
IVE BEEN IN TEARS FOR HOURS I-
I'm quarantined in my studio apartment lmao, I wish I had at least a small yard. My quarantine Is really just my cat and I meowing at eachother.
i honestly thought i was the only one that sneezes when the sun shines on me. psr is an actual thing? holy shit i'm not as weird as i thought i was
One word : Lazy
wearing your precious little watch in the shower makes me worried for your watch. take care of it buddy.
I really like this anime called no game no life but I’m OBSESSED with 7 deadly sins and it’s my favorite. I’ve also been playing animal crossing.
I need to see more of Garrett singing angelically about grapefruits in August lol
Your videos,,,, are the only thing that’s given me serotonin this year my dude
one thing that's helped me over quarantine is sewing! i'm actually in college for fashion design and getting a chance to sew more is something i was really excited to do
I desperately need u to upload another video soon please
“Jam that a woman made me”  is the most unsettling thing about this and that upsets me.
I needed this ❤
These videos are the BEST. Makes my day so much better
Nah Washington also looks like that, cars on fire, bad traffic. Don't let the cute little neighborhoods fool you lol
What is the bloody looking shirt hanging on the wall?  I need to know now.
time isn’t real
i love u sm
A night in your life
When he was talking about the half time show I was like, oh yeah 2018 I remember. Wtf
ur so precious garrett i love you so much🥺🤍
Reading webtoons like crazy
Garret is really good at singing, also swords make me anxious since I watched super dark times
I feel like we would be best friends but my fiance would hate us together because we would be the loudest, least productive people on the face of the planet 🤣
Andrew and garret are the only ones who can save 2020, just hearing their laughs fix everything
writing music !! check out sarah vera on spotify <3
We need much more Garrett & Andrew 💙  ALSO!! those plates are absolutely not food safe ☠
Shane: gets cancelled, all subscribers leave Subscribers: all hop to Garretts channel  *we only stan the spooky boys + andrew, - shane*
garrett is the blond version of ted nivison
I've been working the entire time this has been going on, i work at a grocery store. When I'm not at work I usually watch anime and play video games to unwind from all the stress
w-wait, you guys have felt anything besides depression since quarantine started? I thought it was just a joke?  in all honesty I have started new book and tv series that we’re popular when I was kid, since my favorite series of all time was ruined by the creator for me (trans rights are human rights, by the way). I bought the Percy Jackson books and started avatar the last air bender. I’m loving both so far.
Are you and shane still friends because iam a fan of the whole squad and you
Great to see you back. But really hope what Shane is going through  with pedophilia shows you to stop doing such violent and horrible things to those horrible babie dolls Was not funny. Seems just to do something to top something and do bizarre things just to have content.
Garrett uploading always makes me so happy 🥺  He’s just so pure all the time man
i would actually watch a series where andrew and garrett go up to washington and go ghost hunting. washington/pnw is by far one of the spookiest places in america
Awww i wish i could be in of you videos
Uh, i want a Washington Video 🙀
This video is the perfect depiction of having a friend with ADHD hahaha
Can I just be their  best friend
i'm so happy <3 thank u
Disney princess garret watts
I’ve found making movie nights with my roommates or painting nights has helped me get through quarantine
I need that Harry Potter shirt 😭
This is the first "day in my life" video I've ever actually related to.
I feel slightly better of having a sleep schedule of going to sleep at 8am and waking up at 8pm
Garrett idk if we're soulmates or what but you just crack me up. ILYSM please make more videos! Btw if you ever decide to be straight call me lol
Yes we need a night in your life ♥️♥️
I love that your thriving .Love your video keep it up
This whole video gives me serotonin
THIS IS SO FUNNY y’all should make more videos together fr this is great I love you guys y’all are the best duo
KFJDNDDJ I LEGIT SLEEP WITH A SAMURAI SWORD NO JOKE AGHHH
“Did you hear a spider?” 😂😂
You made me feel alive today.
what i do in quarantine to cope is make microwave lentils and then add cloud right to the weird bag they come in. this makes the lentils cool down so that they don't burn my tongue but the rice warm up so that it feels like it could me a meal that you left of the counter for 10 minutes so its now like luke warm? its really good and helps a lot but only eat one bag a night or you might throw up (i had to learn the hard way).
Garrett is so freakin cute he can’t get mad at anyone without laughing😂❤️
I was so excited when he said he got his own youtooz I checked the website and it says sold out
Petition for Garrett to post the full song of 'Grapefruits are green' in youtube.
I have PSR too 🥺
I've been exercising no less than every other day with lots of stretching! And I started playing Stardew Valley again which makes me really happy!
I like to watch anime with my kitten ( my hero academia/ HunterXhunter/ fairy tale
I wondered why Garrett wasn't posting on YouTube and I don't own any other social media so I thought he was just busy. I was in fact correct 🤣 also Garrett is reminding me of Micarah Tewers. They both give out chaotic, golden retriever,ADHD energy. WOW I love them🖤
Succulent propagation and direct sales have been my quarantine hobbies! 🌱💸
I just love this
i missed you
grapefruits are green in august
To answer your question.... I have discovered weed and it has helped me out alot with my random down days. It makes me giggle 😁❤️❤️ stay distracted!
Me and Andrew have the same birthday! Oh yeahhh
at 22:36 I thought Garrett was just low key holding a joint and im like "yeah okay"
I had a huge haircut
READING
Can I clean your glasses, please?🧐
I've been taking my dog on lots of walks
Garrett should definitely make a video on a night in his life 🤣😂🤣
Loved every bit of this and I missed you so much! You and Andrew make me smile.
Don’t microwave that plate, it has gold edging and will break your microwave!!
We are two friends and you are stuck on the roof and your not allowed to leave. Pizza on the roof......Pizza Party! 🤣🍕😂🍕
"im not most people im a bit of a disaster"
i've been crying all day because i'm in quarantine again and i'm lonely and unproductive and waking up late then i put this on and just die laughing & feel so much better -- tysm garrett & andrew i needed this so bad
To be honest, Garrett will always be feeling some insane sense of dread or strangeness because he enjoys being a mess.
Grapefruits are green in August > Now I'm a Baby
I go to sleep at 5AM and sleep till 12PM
To answer your question I got discord and I have made so many new friends and it had been so fun
Cleaning, I feel better when I clean but recently I’ve been in a funk so I haven’t cleaned very much🤷🏻‍♀️
I’ve been organizing my room! It’s been a struggle but it’s worth it for the end result 😅 (Sorry I’m late!)
Me buying a pregnancy pillow after watching this
I also have photic sneeze reflex!! It's truly bizzare and puts me into a state of confusion everytime I'm suddenly faced with any kind of bright light.  Instead of stepping out into the sun I'll sometimes turn my phone flashlight on and slowly point it toward my face and that also works
those plates are probably not microwave safe because of the gold lining 😔
I’ve decided to read every Stephen king book and document all the connections that tie his books together in my fancy notebook
I'm gonna start sleeping with a pregnancy pillow and a sword too lmao
Garret is the main character...                        That’s it that’s the comment
Petition for garrett and andrew to do the city museum in st louis once quarantine is over
Cross stitching 💪🏼
Imagine being Garretts neighbors. It would be so fun 😂
Gosh this video was soo refreshing, wish for more uploads.
Please make a night in ur life. I just woke up and it's 4pm hey from Canada
How do I become this level of chaotic
I've been hanging out with my cat and doing alot of art like painting and digital art
Strange, cause to me this feels like the fasters year if my life. I feel like March when pretty much the shit hit the pan was like yesterday and the summer is already over??! I feel like i haven’t accomplished anything or made any good memories this year and its almost over. Its the fastest year there’s ever been to me and i’m not happy about it
I aspire to this level of chaos.
I've actually been having a really hard time through this because I live with my h×mophobic parents and just yikes. But I've been rewatching some of your videos and this one made me really happy just because you're pretty dang amazing. So, thank youuuu for being you and helping me get some sanity back. 💖 Wish me good luck at college (start on Tuesday, aaah)
eating cake with chopsticks has never crossed my mind...until now.  + I got pets during quarantine so i have something to love, even if they poop every 10 minutes (i know, it's insane)
Since all of this started, I’ve been eating out less and cooking more. I feel 1,000% better (so does my bank account).
Yes make a podcast with Andrew!
Broooo sun sneeze club!!
None of you guys are no better than Shane so shut up
he's so precious
I love writing especially now in quarantine, writing has always been my escape from reality and transferring my feelings throughout this very lonely quarantine and turning it into a solid new story is always fun :D also I hope everyone reading this is having a great day
ANDREW!! <3
Grooming routine I think you should change the name.
covid -  me - you make me wanna slam my pots
Grapefruits are green in august
I wish I had a relationship like that with my mom. You’re very blessed
Why is no one talking about Garret’s beautiful singing 😔
i frequently find myself singing grapefruits are great in august nowadays
I've rewatched The Seven Deadly Sins....close to 4,672 times....since March.
Washington 💜
Garrett your singing voice is SO good!!! 😊 <3
wait i didnt know other people sneeze in the sun i feel so seen
#ANDRET
Ummm... Im like 97% sure that your dream car on your fridge is literally my family's old RV that we had when I was child. I affectionately called it the Mystery Machine.... we all had matching shirts with the mystery machine on the fronts and our names on the back lmaoooo
YOUR BACK🥺🥺🥺🥺
speaking on behalf of everyone, we want a night in the life.
Hey Garrett how many watts is your microwave?
GARRET YOURE BACK
Aw that ghost toy is so cute! And baby yoga ☺️
13:40 wait, if andrew isn't filming you here, THEN WHO IS???
We have a daddy long legged spider named Frank on our ceiling that we randomly watch.
I love you so much, sir i-
i missed Garrett so much. we all need some Garrett Watts content rn ily
Everyone is watching the video while I’m wondering how *cozy* that baby Yoda must be 👀
I went to look at the figure and it's all sold out :'(
Hold up new idea for a squad drew,Andrew,and Garrett
During quarantine, I tried baking cookies but ended up eating unhealthy amounts of raw cookie dough🤧
Ok so I was mad you haven't posted in FOREVER so I unsubscribed. BUT I have now resubscribed because of this wild energy vlog. Stunning production
I need a friend like Garett and a boyfriend like Andrew 😂
Garrett’s content is incredible bc it’s just him being himself
Literally me when the teacher ask questions 29:22
god yes make a night in the life this was brilliant content that I didn't know I needed on my Saturday morning
AAAAAAAAAA
A Night in the Life of Garret is what I want. As a insomniac, I really want to see it 🥴
I have been playing so much animal crossing! I got a new job so I’m able to work from home which is so weird. I wear pajamas all day and get paid to take phone calls 😂 I love being able to spend time with my person more so I don’t mind being at home!
So wholesome
I've been re watching Phineas and Ferb on Disney+ to feel better, and it's been great :)
garrett your videos are always so pure and make me smile and laugh so much! you never have negative vibes or say mean things and i always feel so uplifted after watching your videos. honestly whatever you upload i will definitely watch :))) and your friendship with andrew is so cute i want it!!!!!!!! i love you and i cant wait till the next video! alsoooo in quarantine ive been listening to music (tame impala is my fav i recommend them), going on walks with my neighbours doggo and watching a shit ton of netflix hahahhaha :)))
Is the girl with the wine a paid actor
i love the content man! hope u keep creating!
Garetts mind:StOp TALkiNg sO fASt  i caNt eVEn KeEp up wITh u
Andrew and Garret raising their voices at each other over the squirrel sweater sent me to a different realm
I have never posted a comment on YouTube so it’s really the cereal in the fridge for me
This video made my year 😸
:<<< you make me so happy you make me happy stim !!!
I will forever wait for the collab between Garret and Sassy Wine Lady :)
why do hallucinogens when you could just observe Garret Watts
what I have done over quarantine: hand-sewn my own little muppet (with zero experience)!  His name is Rudy and he wears a cute little green hat on top of his head! The process was a  mess but he came out good anyway in the end! He unintentionally looks like the lovechild of a brown bear and a panda and has fluffy paws and he has a mouth plate so he can talk!!
This is peak ADHD energy
wishing i was that yoda...
My morning sneeze 😂😂
For the question, I literally have been bingeing the show Supernatural. Like...Nonstop.   Cas: And of course Sam is an abomination. Me: *cackles alone in a dark living room*  Me: *Laughter dies* What am I doing with my life?  (Side note, really good show btw)
I havent laughed for real in a long time thanks for the video and please make me with andrew!!!
Ive never seen Andrew so much in a video like I'm loving it!! LMAO when they were arguing lmaoooo
"if you don't think this is work, you don't what I do" - he is so right!!!!
I'm doing awful but thank you for the good vibes
I'm sorry but his face when he said "I hope it didn't go and Gracie's backyard she'll scream at me."😭😂☠️🤦
ok like who tf went back in time and messed up the future . am i right guys?
Ok but Garrett actually CALLING for pizza is actually the biggest achievement
I worked through out quarantine but i did a bit of excersice for my stomach (not successful) got active with duolingo and started ghibli movies but didn't finish all
I love you Garrett and I would very much like to be your friend
I would give Andrew anything that he wants from me if he wants
I do the sneezing thing and I thought everybody did it until all my coworkers bullied me for it
Awww I miss hearing Andrew’s laugh!
14:06 first of all i thought andrew was the one filming, second of all the time on the text says 12:20 AM??? whAt?
Ghost content 😌
how can a human being have so many thoughts within 39 minutes
I have been learning Klingon over the quarantine. It's nice to focus on something that distracts from anything abnormal going on.
Garrett would prob be the coolest math teacher. Don’t ask my why I think that, I just know.
32:03 Jack Stauber #2, who? 😂
During this quarantine, I've been visiting my boyfriend once/twice a week and have been making room to spend more time with my two cats, Kiku and Cheese :)
Read My Giant Nerd Boyfriend on Webtoons Mr. Garrett. You will fall in love.
I tip my hat to you sir 🎩🧐😏 👻
Garrett & Andrew as best friends is so wholesome 🤍! The quarantine content we deserve.
You are the best garret (: I’m genuinely happy that you exist here in this world (: you and Andrew!! (:
A true Gemini energy.
THIS IS SO CHAOTIC I LOVE IT GARRETT HELP

GHOST CONTENT GHOST CONTENT
so glad gare bear's back! he and kurtis conner are the only 2 ppl legally allowed to post anything on the internet in my opinion
i immigrated to canada in december, and a week ago someone asked me how long i'd been here and i replied "oh just 3 months".  i actually thought it'd been like 3 months, its been almost 9
i started watching anime and playing field hockey
garret just gained so much more clout since shane is finally being held accountable for being manipulative as hell. congrats yall!!
40 minutes ill never get back... but guess what? I don't want them. Worth it 🖤 we love Garrett.  Noticed something but I really hope its just me.  Anyway the night video would be dope. Wish I would've ran into you guys while yall were up in Washington
Garrett!!!!!! You’re my horrible personal flaw soulmate and I’d love to sleep in with you until 1:33pm one day because I have 0 discipline or shame, but anyway love ya
Living on YouTube watching spooky videos and watching yiu
i don't know about you but i think Garrett and shane have kind of similar expression while talking...
If Queen Jenna Marbles ever comes back to Youtube, I would love to see a collab with Garrett.
As one night owl adult to another, my hobbies have been crocheting, random art things, lots of online video games (classic wow baby!) and procrastinating chores.  I'm also building/making things for my guinea pigs, like a soft hidey and stuff.
I could only dream of a friendship like Garrett and Andrew’s.
omg i love this  hahhaahah
Garrett is chaotic good
During quarantine I watched youtube and started running.  I can run 3 miles now which is pretty cool.
I got a new puppy over quarantine
so much teletherapy. like. 3 days a week. can’t do anything else, might as well improve myself the best i can!!!
I've been listing to Julie Andrews read children's books https://www.julieslibraryshow.org/
This was delightful! Garrett is one of my favorites!
Ok wait, so you’re telling me the guy in the shower is the same Garett we know and love? 😳
I thought it was just me, it’s a thing? Psr?
Garret I love you 💕
Grapefruits are green is the quarantine song we all needed
Is that a jackofthedust skull in the background ?
We NEED a night in your life 💀
I've been teaching my 4 year old about cryptids aliens and dinosaurs.
I don't know why my crappy Chromebook never alerted me that you made a new video! So when I saw that this was a week earlier, I immediately clicked!  It's so good to have you back on YouTube Garrett!!  We missed you!!   <3
Watching Gilmore girls with my dog tede ♥️
If Garrett and Andrew don’t do a ghost hunting video I’m gonna be so mad.
*i love that shane got canceled so we all just go to garret*
where is the straight garrett watts i need to marry him asap
I’ve been picking up some hobbies that I have no idea how to do. Like painting and embroidering and getting plants! I’ve only killed two plants so far.
I love Garrett 😍❤️😍❤️❣️💖😻😍💖💘🤩❤️💜
watching lots of anime 💖
in quarantine i got a sweet new pet gecko and i watched all the studio ghibli movies
Most of my quarantine has been spent as an essential worker, but when I do have free time I watch horror / cult movies and shows with my gf. And I replayed all of Bioshock for the 1000th time.
PLEASE MAKE THE "A NIGHT IN MY LIFE" VIDEOOOOOOOOOOO🖤
I thought I was the only strange one who sneezed every time I went outside in the sun. I prefer to say that I'm allergic to the sun 😂
I've writing about everything I do in a journal so someone in the future can find it and hopefully read what I did during quarantine
The Pizza Hut in my town burned down and was replaced by a car dealership 😭
hey i’m super lonely and need friends
I got a sketchbook and started drawing. its something i have always wanted to be good at but have always felt discouraged and it has been amazing to see what im capable of and how much better ive gotten :) also embroidery, its very time consuming and also very satisfying i embroidered the cutest frog holding her knees and just smiling and god she's precious and i just get to hang her! in her hoop! for everyone to see!
This is the absolute best YouTube video I’ve seen in a while. Please make a night in my life video with Andrew! You guys make me smile and laugh so much!
Benjamin needs more outfits!
HE'S NOT DEAD
👽👾❤
He sounds like josh gad singing 😂
I only watched Shane’s videos for garret and Andrew, so glad they got away from the criminal though
I totally want to see “A Night in My Life” video!!
Everytime i watch you i wish i was a man so we could get married
Ever since “Now I’m a Baby” came out Garrett is becoming a real singing star
Ah yes “Grapefriuts are Green” my favorite Kate Bush song
I just want to say just listening to Garrett and watching him is really helping laugh right now. I am so thankful for him as a person always being a source of fun and laughter in my life! Thank you Garrett!!
I've been watching all the anime series I've told myself I'd watch, but always postpone out of the fear of wasting time. And spending extra snuggle time with my cat Simon.  Side note: I will always love watching a video from Garrett showing us all the knick knacks in his house and their stories
Why does Andrew and Garrett have Jenna and Julien energy
Grape fruits are green is my favourite
When Garrett's quarantine fit is your dream wardrobe :)
brilliant
Need the grapefruit song on all streaming platforms ASAP
i got a bearded dragon named Festus and he’s the best chubby quarantine buddy, also i’m knitting him a blanket 👉👈
the kill bill vibes are immaculate
When I was having to do school work everyday I would do it outside to get fresh air
Why is Garrett's videos, literally my brain
omg im loving the dynamic XD Gaarrett moreeeepleasee
garrett reminds me of matthew gray gubler. i love it
I have always loved your editing style and how you make everything so fun and fast-paced bc it fits you rlly well!! It also must take a long time to edit, so we always appreciate your hard work!!!! 💓
Im high risk so have been in my one bed flat for 5 months without leaving ... I coped by buying  two goldfish named howl who spends much of his time in his underwater castle and Jeff goldbloom because although his first partner died life...er ... finds a way. And in a moment of manic depression I also learnt how to tattoo myself , perhaps you could draw my next one?
Oh Garrett I missed you <3 Stay safe & well (:
This was exactly what I needed after everything that has happened this year!! Love you both so much ❤️❤️😊
I missed you so much Garrett 💗
THE SUN MAKES ME SNEEZE TOO
does garrett really have a manager?
I love the abs ADD vibes this man gives off
Garret! I missed you :D
Collab with Brittany Broski PLEASEEEE
I finally know what's missing in my life....a pocket skeleton! . . . ...And more videos of Garrett and Andrew just being random, adorable, and hilarious. <3
To all the people surprised by Garret’s 3pm breakfast: Let me introduce you to my 8pm breakfast
Garrett is like a real-life cartoon character. I need his kind of energy in my life.
The last bit of him singing sounds like it be a song from adventure time
it was the pocket skeleton for me 🥺
i love you so match.   your so funny
I have literally watched the Lorax and the grinch over 30 times each. Do t ask me why because I don't know
Garrett! May we be friends? I love you and your vid, especially this one; it made me laugh so much during a sh***y time. Same goes to Andrew, ya sweed'art. Ya don't get if ya don't ask! Love your new friend, Bex. Mwah xoxo 😂
When Andrew was acting mad he sounded like Stuart little
Love Garrett
Answer: I've started trying to learn Korean, im reading a lot more, and playing a lot of final fantasy. But sadly I am still at work so I don't have much time to do the stuff I love 😢
The lil bug drawings are such a cute idea
💖great video tysm
Thanks for the fun video. During quarantine, lots of Netflix and crocheting! 🧶
You’ve replaced a lover with a pregnancy pillow.... a fucking genius
Y’all were in WA?!! And of course it was during quarantine so I never would’ve been able to see you 😭
I would 100% get that little bug tattooed on my body
grapefruits...are green....in august
Animal Crossing is the reason I survived lockdown :p ! Amazing video, so good to see you and Andrew!!
i hope you weren't joking when you said there was 'so much ghost content coming'!
Y’all are just cottage core 😭😭😭😭 pls make the Washington videos
Me abt to go into my 8:30 class and watching this instead:👁👄👁
Your videos always have me in tears. 😂😂😂 You're hilarious. I love all your random items in your home.  To answer your question: I have been watching a lot of movies and tv shows that I haven't had time to watch pre-quarantine. Umbrella Academy is amazing. ❤️☂️
We love one king!!
okay jim and pam
To answer the question: I've been spending time with my pet rainbow stag beetle, his name is Fork <3
I was lucky enough to keep my job during this ...trying... time so I'm using my stimulus money to buy weird shit from small businesses, mostly on Etsy. It's been pretty rewarding so far, and now with the USPS drama, we need to support local and small businesses even more. If we get that second check, I think I'll do the same thing. Everyone stay strong.
Theory for ages: They're dating xD
cant wait for Garrett's album to drop
Painting a lot
The grapefruits are green song went on longer than I thought it would, but it just progressively got better. I am going to need you to pop that sucker on Spotify, please.
garrett’s laugh can cure cancer
Garrett is the embodiment of chaotic good energy
This whole video just radiates goblin energy!
I've been fostering a coin sized baby turtle I found in my backyard
Grapefruits are green in august
Wow I love this man
I miss shane
i feel like i just watched a movie, this was wild
i love their friendship so much
I know this is a bad idea but he low key needs tips get into anime like my hero academia and walk around dressed up as them
Thank you garret for being you.
I love watching Garrett’s videos, because you get to see him and Andrew and it’s so much more real.
But is your sword signed by Randy Jackson?
been working on my Denki cosplay and making silly TikToks
Now I want a pregnancy pillow.
You scared my kitten with the loud noise at 13:30 :(
my favorite🥺
I just saw Garrett shower......can quarantine more strange .
I've been watching Black Clover and In/Spectre for anime to pass time!  😁
When garret called andrew a simp
You deserve so much love Garrett
Garrett sings like an old lady.
Sir. Are you still friends with S.D?
For me, what has helped me out is muy favorito hobbies: reading sci-fi books, watching conspiracy/paranormal videos, listen to music (all kinds at this point). I've never watched one piece, but since quarantine's been so long I gave It a shot, AND now I somehow ended up liking It.  I was a night owl too, but had to head back to the office 🥺 that made some type of routine for me. Also my best friend works on the same office I do. Having him around Is a blessing.  So, my advice to everyone is: be surrounded with persons and things you love, makes this nonsense (pandemic) existence a little more beareble.
He says Andrew didn’t stay the night but who is filming all of those shots 😂
A night in your life? Yes please!
Garrett really shows he lives on the edge with that La Croix at 35:15
night in my life pleassseee! i love you and andrew !!!!!
Anyone else get motion sick during the squirrel sweater part? Lmfao
if spongebob squarepants was a human:
How does anyone NOT like Garrett’s videos?! This made my whole crazy year!!
i can not express how much i love this man, i mean, i still have depression, but he makes it less hard. LOVE YOU GARRET 💖💖
This video & seeing your smiling face made my whole year, that is the atrocity 2020! 🤩
Harry Potter, clash Royale and youtube are the only things getting me through quarantine
Damn I was lowkey excited when he said Andrews bday was on the 9th because mine is too and then Andrew had to correct him smh
I know why and how this pure man gets brain deals it's because he's such a wholesome baby boy and not problematic
ahhh i missed andrew’s laugh
when u showed the bright sun I sneezed twice I think I have that lol
I’m glad that Andrew and Garrett have each other.
Garrett and Jack Stauber need to make music together. Would be such a crazy creative thing it’s all I’ve been thinking about .
His woman and kid impressions are ✨immaculate✨
I've been doing a lot of arts and crafts. 🎨🖍️ It's nice for something to grab your attention. Not to mention Bing watching YouTube! Lol😅
Garrett is and always will be my favorite Gemini!
Garrett going off about his squirrel sweater being more important than work is me all through university
This boy really needs a dog
GOD I'VE MISSED GARRETT AND ANDREW
I’ve been watching my hero academia and finished it in 3 days-
Garrett, my man crush for life, he's just a fun lovable guy. Love the grapefruit opera moment.
i NO IDEA that Garrett is a GREAT SINGER. He should do a Musical video (like maybe a Harry Potter parody).
i hope that you & Shane are still friends or trying to revive/fix your friendship.
Is it just me or is there no Japan video? (not hating just asking)
this literally made me so happy:)
I've been slowly doing "get my life in order" stuff, and trying not to shame myself about how long it takes. So organizing shit and getting into hobbies. I have a clean desk and some finished art so far!
I think Garrett's one of my favourite people in the world🥺  I really need more songs from him😂 I could listen to "Grapefruits are Green in August" all day
i repainted my desk because why not!
I've been learning to sew so I can make cosplays!
You will always be your favorite human! I wanna send you a gift! How does one do this? 🤗
Grapefruits are green is stuck in my head forever now
To feel better during quarantine, I bought a hamster! She and my dog are best friends and boop noses all the time! Curie and Max :)  I love your videos, Garrett!
I've been hanging out wtih my cat and playing,...... so much Hollow Knight on my Switch
Night in my lifeeeeeee videooooo!!!!!!!
Yep. I’ve found my new insult: “you make me want to crawl into the dryer and tumble around till I die”.
My new kitty Nori and I hang out everyday and I enjoy playing and watching my 2 cats play together.
Garrett:”U wanna talk about tracks,I think there’s a train down the road”  I’m sorry but that’s my favourite thing ever 👁👄👁
❤️u and Andrew so much!
Welcome back to YouTube, Garrett and Andrew! Missed you guys. <3
Andrews my future husband 🙊
Can we have a night in ur life😂😂❤
Garrett and Andrew laughing keep me sane🐱💕🇨🇦
I started living on a ranch in the middle of the Texas desert. Lots of frogs, so many frogs, and a turkey. You'd love it!
When I was a kid I used to think I was part vampire and when I sneezed in the sun I thought it was my vampire genes reacting to it
I love watching you!!! You make my heart happy! 🥰
You should post more I love your videos
im drunk and this is helping/ not helping me sooooo much. lmao.
I HAD NO CLUE WHAT PHOTIC SNEEZE REFLEX WAS AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY BECAUSE THE SUN MAKES ME SNEEZE THIS IS VERY SHOCKING INFORMATION FOR ME-
14:33 I come back to listen to Grapefruits are Green In August
Well Garrett I have found a little rat in my backyard and I have been taking care of it over quarantine
Finally :))
i’ve been working out durning quarantine and eating clean :)
I have been playing with my little hamster, listening to music and watching kdramas lol. Btw I want to say that your videos always make me so happy and thank you for that.
Leftovers of birthday cake for breakfast are my kind of healthy breakfast🍰✨!!!
39:11 minutes of pure serotonin. ❤
I am also a photic sneezer. I am sitting outside whilst watching this and I just sneezed before commenting LOL
I think everyone needs this
I keep on forgetting that wine lady *is* Garrett and that he’s actually just correcting his self...editing must be fun Also, GARRETTS LIFE IS MORE PUT TOGETHER THAN MINE,I PROMISE YOU
Personally during quarantine (that I had spend in Finland during my Erasmus year *great timing*) I have start to wrote a novel. That have always be a dream of mine, and so I did it base on gameplay of my fav game ever Skyrim ! You can literally escape in ur thoughts and that’s amazing during those time 😉 Here you go that was my activity recommendation! (lv u bro from France 🇫🇷)
I have a morning sneeze too!!!
PSR is a thing??? I always look at light when I feel I will sneeze cus it helps me sneeze you know how sometimes you feel like you should sneeze but the sneeze disaapears
Unstan Shane stan Garret
Grape fruiiiiits are greeeeeeeen in Auguuuuust
To feel better I got a cactus, he makes me happy and is named Cob 😊
I'm so proud of you two!!! Seriously you seem so happy. 💜💜
I love you Garrett never change boo.
I feel like Garrett always dresses like an awkward science teacher and I love it
yes yes please night in my life
Playing videogames with my brother and sister, fiancee too. We all live together and we're all over 25 just living the best we can. We do movie nights too and since we're all introverts, it works! Our cats also keep us entertained and we of course keep them happy with treats and stuff off amazon.
petition for garret  and morgan to make a channel together
31:37 - 31:54 is my favorite part of the entire video and that's saying something, because I've been cracking up and relating the whole time.   I've missed you Garrett <3
why is this the most chaotic thing i’ve ever seen yet so relaxing
Snoogle Pillows for the WIN
I wish people were informed that Garrett and Andrew were in Washington! That would have been nice. Also!! @ 06:54 that Baby Yoda that Andrew is cuddling is fricken adorable!!
Well Garrett posted a video now we gotta wait another 5 months
Welcome to ADHD tiktok
I DIDNT KNOW THAT OTHER PEOPLE SNEEZED WHEN THEY WENT INTO THE SUN WHAT?!?! I THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY

I could watch videos with Garrett and Andrew literally all day!!
♥♥♥♥♥ we need more 😭
The wholesome silliness is refreshing
Grapefruits are green in August  👁️👄👁🍊
This is my answer to the question but prepare for it it's very long so I hope you see it   So at the beginning of quarantine I decided I needed a air conditioner finally. because it gets very hot where I live and I'll be cooped up in the house more. so I got one and when it was installed in my window it left a hole which many bugs have came through. So as a person that cannot kill spiders because I love them and I would feel eternally guilty, I made a home for them in a gigantic Mason jar. that I poked holes in filled with sand dirt and a couple of leaves and sticks and I put all my little spider friends in there  and if a gnat gets in I proceed to catch them and put them in my spider home 🏡 for them to have a snack also I ordered live crickets so they may have a steady food source. so yes. :) also a lot of moths come in and I kinda just let them vibe and be fascinated by my lamp until I release them. Thanks if u read all this by the way I love u and your presence makes my life happier 💛
To feel better I've been learning about healing crystals and meditation.
PLEASE MAKE THE NIGHT IN MY LIFE VIDEO I DO SOME WEIRD SHIT LIKE SHOW MEMES TO PEOPLE WHO ARENT THERE AND I NEED VALIDATION PLZ
Loved the video!! Can't wait for more from you! OMG I could smell the Mormon on you cousin from here! So very Mormon. Just so Mormon.

Garret I would pay any amount of money for a drawing of a bug from you. Literally make an Etsy. Do it.
the alien explanation worked
You are everything I've always wanted to be
Oh....I thought time feeling distorted was normal👀😂
garrett i love you your vibes are the best and you’re so funny and whenever i’m in a sad mood i’ll just watch your videos and laugh. thank you for being you!! ❤️
Now all I can picture is the sleepy squirrel in a crocheted sweater. He is just making sure animals are ready for fall fashion week.  I love how Andrew is trying to be the voice of reason and not clipping Garrett's creative wings. They seem to have fun hanging out and just being buds.
GARRETTS LAUGH IS THE BEST
"She flirting from behind the pizza"
it took me the jlo shakira super bowl performance to realise how messed up 2020 is lmao.
Okay but can we all agree that the J-LO and Shakira Super Bowl Half Time Show definitely happened this year and not back in 2018?
"do you hear a spider?"
Over quarantine I started playing pony town :) also will the mini garetts be having a restock? I want one so bad :(
I am sorry for not having a healthy answer to your question, but the good news is: i am still able to answer your question, which means I somehow managed to survive until now. Oh, it wasn't about surviving, it was about feeling better. Do some art stuff. I hope you get better suggestions from better people...
A romantic Pizza Hut date with Andrew on Garrett’s rooftop 😍
Having PSR is a major flex tbh
my settings were set to 2x speed... I almost died
I knew he was gonna eat the cake lol
Burglar: *comes in with gun* Garrett (holding a katana, whose been waiting for this moment for forever): e___e
Hes never gonna have a normal upload schedule 😭
i love the song grapefruits are green  i need more of it
The little random things at your house give me inspiration. Also I need a POCKET SKELETON
I got one of those pregnancy pillows while recovery from surgery and it was the best thing ever...until my Labrador also thought it was the best thing ever and since she is the only child I couldn't say no. I also sleep with a sword...and 3 🗡 .
Garrett on a roof with a keyboard is all I needed to make my quarantine better
Is Andrew and Garrett still friends with Shane?
Answer : I have been learning Bass guitar and reading every book. Who would have thought I had so many books, it’s like they never end.
garrett absolutely needs to voice act in an animated musical
Am I supposed to ignore that he kept saying 3pm and edited 12:30am onto the phone when they were texting about coffee. 😂 just the best
Oh man I missed Benjamin more than Garrett😌
Love you 2 so much.  Love u two love birds.
You should make a video of you recreating the wine girl positions but like the Garrett way
Hey I hope all is well God is good and loves you. Have a great day keep on being loving and being kind to everyone 💕🌸✝️
Does anyone else get super sad just cuz they're a nobody and has 0 chance of ever being friends with Garrett and Andrew? Just me?? Like genuinely sad...
The kinda energy Garrett gives off is the kinda energy 2020 needs but hasn't gotten.
The pure chaos of this video is what I’ve needed
To keep me and my mind busy and creating I've just been working on the podcast during quarantine. I get enjoyment out of it even though it's work.
Yes I would like a knight in your life video
im so triggered that u put cereal in the fridge
Ughhh you guys I needed this! 😍💜
D
God Andrew is so adorable
I went to Oregon, lived with my best friend and her family, and worked on a hemp farm for a month. That was the peak of my quarantine, everything else has sucked 🤣
garrett singing is a cultural reset and now I can’t stop daydreaming about his voice in other songs-
to make myself feel better during quarantine i really just tried to talk to my friends over face time as much as possible to stay connected and frankly sane
HI GARRETT
during quarantine I have been watching every music video I come across
I just love this. Truly. Keep being you Garret and Andrew. I love you guys. 💜💜💜
Garrett’s vibrato is NOT what I was expecting... mans is hella talented
that grapefruit song bit had me crying I watch it every day
All. Time. Favorite. Youtuber.
Really curious, what shoes is Garrett wearing?!?
i go to sleep at 10:00am then wake up at 7:00 pm like? ur sleep schedule is  worse? 🤣
major alton brown energy going on here
I miss when he posted more often I hope he goes back to the soon but still gets to have a life off of YouTube
Everytime I watch a video of Garrett’s, it makes me feel like I’m watching the office because of all the camera angles and zoom ins! It’s amazing 😂❤️
To make myself happy this quarantine I have reread the entirety of the Twilight Saga, then read Midnight Sun, then rewatched all the movies. This weekend my friend and I are having a marathon and making each movie into a drinking game.
Reading has made me feel good and I spend hours reading
Garret Watts IS the gay version of Dwight Schrute from The Office
night in my life please
Over Quarantine i watched literally every single one of your videos.  Ur literally me grown up and i live for it.
I can't really consider this a quarantine in my case. But what I did for the last 5 month was working on a ranch with horses and cows. Keeps me busy, I'm at the fresh air all day and I get to cuddle cute animals. :-)
I feel that we all need a pocket skeleton
Video calls to my friends. That make me feel better :)
You know what, this has helped me a lot. So thank you.
Over quarantine i’ve been knitting portraits of 12 harry potter characters to make into a blanket! 💕☺️
This is everything I didn't know I needed right now. I love you both! Also I was on a walk today before having watched this video and I was thinking about getting onto my roof from my bathroom window since I've never done it 🤭 great minds think alike 😉  Stay amazing Garrett!! ❤
noo not me watching this video for the 100th time because it's the only thing making me happy these days whattt😌😌
To answer your question, I've been playing the fuck out of Ghost of Tsushima, Nioh 2 and Onimusha. Also I've watched well over 150 movies since the pandemic happened. I'm currently watching One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest
8:23 SHINCHAN'S DAD BRUHHHHH <3 <3 <3
How come you didn’t introduce us to Batman, but even more disappointing that you didn’t let us see Lupin when it’s an excellent figure
answer for the end of the video: at the start of quarantine i was like trying to get into fitness but had to stop after two weeks because i dislocated my knee(again) because  ✨my kneecaps are a piece of shit✨ but honestly ive just been doing art and listening to hours of music 👁️👄👁️
This is kind of a different aside, but you really inspired me in your random decoration of just knick knacks and things that warm the heart all around your space over the time you've been doing videos the past few years. I took a look around my room right now and I'm really happy with the little things that cover my space and shows who I am as a person. So thank you! :)
to answer your question: playing animal crossing and hanging out with the bf, just recently started playing stardew valley! so glad that you posted a video, was missing your wholesome content!
I've been rewatching my favorite movies and making my favorite tea. Plus trying to make fancy food.  Mostly the shining, heathers, and green tea.  :) You're awesome Garrett!!
I've been working this whole pandemic
The singing, the grapefruits, Andrew and Garrett laughing...I needed this.
we neeeeeed a night in your life video 😭🖤
your bathroom friends look like a renaissance painting.
how am i only 2 minutes in and it feels like he's been going on for 10 minutes in a good way tho :)
over quarantine I've been perfecting my quesadilla making and thats it
Garrett is that sword even sharpened haha
he looks and sounds like he's going off the deep end
it's really hard not to psychoanalyze garret and honestly I'm kinda worried
Garrett, your ADHD is outta control in this one. ;P (I say this out of love someone who also has ADHD. :D)
AND OUI'D
Garrett's manic energy is superb
Me: why do i have so much backpain?? Also me: 16:26
I need 'a night in Garrett chaos' pls.
This day in the life video is a joy. Andrew and Garrett filming together is such a joy. Thank you 🙏 Garrett
Garrett! I love you! Lol 😂❤️
This video is amazing... period! ALSO Huge fan of the A NIGHT IN MY LIFE VIDEO 📹🤟  #changemymind
Dang, wish I could have gotten one of the figurines... ❤️
The fucking wine lady lol

Ledgers has it garret is still singing about grapefruits being green in august
Awww, I missed you!!!
24:36 Gay Married Couple argument incoming xD
Omg you are my friend bc you are a geek     and doctor who fan and different
i've rewatched this video like 3 times already just because I missed hearing Andrew and Garrett laugh but also please give us a video about quarantine in washington the world needs it
Garrett eating cake with chopsticks was very on brand
“ghosts, robbers, skeletons, and bad guys.” is the new “lions, and tigers, and bears” 😂👏🏼
To cope during quarantine I've been listening to a podcast called harry potter and the sacred text. Highly recommend btw! Love you Garrett 💕
最高！いつも超楽しいビデオありがとう！
This is the best day in my life I have ever watched. Haven't laughed this much in a long time, love it!
Shane: *Gets Cancelled* Garrett and Andrew: *YEETS TO WASHINGTON*
I love ur channel lol
Garrett, you are a star and I love you and your videos! <3
#relatable with the time in the start
A video vlog of Garrett and Andrew in Washington? YES PLEASE WE NEED IT!
👁️👄👁️ I have psr
I needed Garrett's wholesome mood, I've been so depressed without it
these videos are my favorite thing in the whole world :)))))
ive been listening to A LOT of indie music and dancing around in my room with a skirt on to feel pretty, its what makes me feel sane in quarantine. <3
There better be more ghost content coming.
Also your music is too beautiful 💚
bold of you to assume i feel at all good in this climate, garrett
Answer to your question: staring at my ceiling because why not
we love an unproblematic queen
And Andrew
I love you so much omfg
This video is what adhd feels like
what a lovely singing voice!
I THOUGHT EVERYBODY SNEEZED WHEN THE LIGHT CHANGED!!! WOW  . . Omg im rare😏
I literally love u
Their poor neighbors lol😅
Hi, I know this is really weird but I ship Andrew and Garrett so hard!!! + my dream would be to meet them or even to get Garrett to like this.
His energy is so chaotic
I have Photic sneeze reflex too! Not only do i sneeze when i go outside i sneeze multiple times in a row and it even happens if my phone screen is to bright
I died at "pot baby"
Playing the Sims and binge-watching Dance Moms.
I wish I could like this more than once.
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS VIDEO I LOVE
omg y’all were in WA??? 🥺❤️ I’m glad u enjoyed ur stay
I needed that for my mental health, you just made my day! Merci!
Not drinking till I've been out of bed for at least 8 hours. 10/10 tip
Make the video about Washington pls
Garret sings like a Disney princess
Andrew needs his own little figurine too with a little camera! <3
omg i missed andrew’s voice
eating... and also babysitting a little 1 and a half year old who is funny and cute
true
UGH FINALLY someone else besides myself that has that sneeze reflex LOOL xD
There’s some simp in here lmao
I've been working out since quarantine started, skin care and bike rides 😌
I had chocolate cake for breakfast today.
Garrett and Andrew videos make me happy again ✌🏼😌
It’s the crackhead energy for me
I greatly missed Garrett's lovely charm and Andrew's adorable laugh! But I'm going to a be a party pooper and let you know that those plates are not safe to eat on or put in the microwave. This is the mom friend in me coming out. They are adorable though!
Don’t tell people how nice Washington is the assholes with come and ruin it
I started cosplaying during quarantine and I love it!! 💖
Getting lost in the tiktok vortex.
Hearing garret sing makes me love him more than I already do. Never knew it was possible.
to feel better over quarantine I've just re-watched my only three seasons of Adventure Time and all my What's New Scooby-Doo? episodes I fucking love cartoons so much they are my favorite escape. also putting stickers on everything
aren't they the cutest couple ever? love this relationship
please pretty please do "a night in my life"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i would love it so much I love your videos
I have PSR and never knew that not everyone had it ...until I told my friend to look at the light when she needed to sneeze ...and they all laughed at me and thought I was crazy 🙈🙈😂😂
"This is for you, America" plays inspiring music on his keyboard😂😂😂
Garrett's house is my Animal Crossing dream island tbh
"It is a scientific fact that they turn into strawberries" ... this broke me
I love this video so much
During all of this I've started like 80 new hobbies lmao I've started this embroirery painting thing that I saw on tiktok and they're amazing tbh lol I also started gardening + house plants and have well over 60 plants now. I also got into resin making. So many fun things! But I'm having to go back to work :(
pot baby is garrett, and i think we all know who the other three are
It’s summer why would a squirrel need a sweater right now
I love this video! About the question I watch the mystery playlist of u, Shane and drew 💞
It’s nice to know I’m not the only person who sleeps with a replica of Beatrix Kiddo’s Hanzo sword next to their bed 😂
2:39   is it just me who get's distracted by the lamp reflection on Garret's glasses..??😅😂
Nobody: Me when garret said the half time show in 2018  *nodding my head in reassurance* Garret: it wasn't in 2018 it was this year  Me:??????? sooo..... why aint nobody tell me
release the rest of the fruit musical you coward (im kidding ily this was such a fun video)
This was great. I want *more*!
garret makes me so happy, thats all bye
Garrett is that fun cousin that you didn't grow up with, but you're so glad to have in your adult life
What have I been doing over quarantine?? Puzzles, Skyrim, Animal Crossing:New Horizons, baking, and tie dye. Never had the time to do things like that before, working 70+ hours a week.
If you two move out to live a cottage live in the woods and made a YouTube vblog out of it, I would SUBSCRIBE like there is no tomorrow
"weeellll... top 3" fucking HOT TAKE love it
Garrett is literally me when im on shrooms and I can't stop smiling
ive been baking, and staying close to my loved ones during this quarantine
wait sound stupid saying this but was that snow on the roof
We rescued a cat! That’s what we did, gave him a new loving home and I’m so happy.
I have a big crush on you but I know if we were to be together it would be the biggest disaster ever bc of our twin attention spans
Awww......that makes me feel so much better after realizing that he had Andrew. Garret must be protected!
Keep safe, our dear Garrett.🏵
my sis loves ur youtube chanlell and u updated on her bday
quarantine: *watches Hunter x Hunter over and over*
Wow I’m glad I’m not the only one who is allergic to the sun 😂
we miss Garnett and Shane .You tubes been so boring without them.🌹💞 Andrew is adorable...
Gonna have to get me a pocket skeleton
He is making ADDHD look so cute :D
i’ve been watching death note and painting a LOT. 💚 you garret
I freaking love your videos!!  And as far your question goes, while I was home for the summer I loved taking my dog for car rides (he’s old and doesn’t really do walks anymore so this is the next best thing).  But now I’m back on my college campus so my friends and I walk around campus at night and play Pokémon go :)
Skincare! And spending time with family
Plz someone get this boi a pet squirrel already 🤣
I had a whole baby during quarantine. His name is Elijah and his middle name is Draco and he’s made quarantine amazing :))
He's back!!! Yay!!! Think I'm crushing on Garrett!
Can we agree that Garrett can merch everything and we’ll still buy that shit cs Garrett is random and we love it that way
Garrett really is a living version of “3 in 1” guy
31:48 that’s really scary
This is partially in preparation for university but I've been growing a slightly stupid number of house plants to cheer me up over quarantine. Including a bonsai tree, another little tree dude, eight succulents, some orchids, a spider plant which currently is housing an actual spider that I've named Margaret and I'm planning on getting a peace lily. please someone help me name all of my plants  And like dm me if you want a video tour of my baby plants because I want to show literally everyone them omg
Garrett: *sleeps with pregnancy pillow Advert mid video: *clearblue pregnancy tests
does anyone else think that garretts singing voice is so BEAUTIFUL when he sang "GRapE FrUiTS ArE GReEN"
this was the most chaotic thing ever
❤️
drinking more water during quarantine
I also sneeze at the sun, but I didn't know so little people have it! :0
Yess I want a "night in my life" video
FaceTime
answer to the question: I stay up for an unhealthy amount of hours doing random art, sadly no one appreciates my art but I still enjoy making it. also, I watch a crap ton of things on Netflix. do you have any suggestions on things to watch? my favorite thing to watch is supernatural, I have 3 salamanders and I can't decide to name them, Jared, Jensen, and Misha, or Sam, Dean, and Castiel. I don't know if you even watch supernatural, I'm a huge SPN geek myself lol. well, it's 3:20 in the morning so goodnight.
“Sayonce!!!” He said that so happily 💀💀
I could literally watch Garrett all day long. Hes so precious ❤
your singing voice is my peace
Love love love Garrett and Andrew - this is epic, we all missed you guys xoxox
GARRETT!! why are you like lowkey a musician?! also do you have ADHD, cause same.
My gf doesn't believe that the sun makes me sneeze, now I know 18% more people do too
I need to see 'Garrett and Andrew take Washington' 👍
during quarantine i've been listening to bts and looking into witchcraft. i want to get into yoga next
I want that bug doodle tattooed on my skin
35:47 that's lowkey an aesthetic view right there. I'd have my picture taken like that.
On quarantine i watched a lot of BTS content. Re-watch old music videos, funny compilations, yea they really helped me
Does Garrett edit his own videos?? If so, he fuckin' roooooocks at it. Also has amazing music taste. And such a smart man to post in the controversy of Shane Dawson "cancellation: to remind us about how gorgeous and adorable he is. I adores him 💛🧡❤🧡💛
I love you <3 aaahh
Andrew has the same birthday as me :) hehehe
I have eaten an alarmingly large amount of Reese’s peanut butter cups- 🥖
I really like this guy.
Why does this into remind me of philip defranco
I love Garret and Andrew 🥺
Over quarantine to feel better I’ve been making cartoons/animations for kids via my local libraries social media page :)
I need more Garret and Rexin around content
Wait who’s recording garret in the begin if Andrew not there til 3?
I have watched almost nothing on YouTube except gaming videos for most of the year because I kinda gave up on humanity/was sick to death of hearing about drama. I think I’m going to continue that...but with a side of Garrett 😂 I’m halfway through this and actually crying my eyes out from laughing. This is pure sweetness and joy (and very relatable as I also have a totally trash sleep schedule) 🤣🤣 thank you for being such a delight and making a very shitty anxiety day feel lighter and easier. ❤️
Garrett and Andrew's laugh is so contagious
I love Garrett to death but I can't subscribe to him because of his inconsistency. I have watched every single video at least 3 times though 😂
You’re losing your mind Garret, you been this insane this whole time, but that’s what we love abt you🙆🏻‍♂️🙆🏻‍♂️
Quit YouTube and do Oprah!!!!!!!!
but where did you get the pull cord cd player?????
OMG I needed this you guys laughing made my freaking month!! <3
So you’re telling me they’re not married?
Make the Night in my life  pleaseeeee?! Im a night owl too!
First of all, this IS ME. Secondly I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!! 💖💗💕
i want a night in ur life please and thank you
to feel better i just cry until i cant breathe lol
Thank you I’m glad I’m not alone Garret
I've been playing waaay to much minecraft and listening to podcasts about serialmurders,massmurders, cults and mystical beings. (I am still working so I don't have that much free time)   ANYWAYS, I love you Garrett. Just thought I'd share that to. Be you and be best ❤   Hej from Sweden 👋🌲🏕🇸🇪
Garret! If its not Nimbus 2000, throw the broom away..
Garrett if you don’t want that tiny rattan chair you chucked across the backyard I will BUY IT FROM YOU.
my answer to the question: Youtube Netflix  And making a scrappy little paper mache cobra for my dad's birthday which is already a day late
The king has returned
I feel this video sm it’s not even funny
Ok so can Garret just post more often and make my life happy? Since he’s genuinely kind and just.. genuine I’d much rather watch him than a lot of people on YouTube
To feel better I've been going to sleep and waking up when I want to which is 3am to 12 noon. I've been watching nostalgic movies. I've been dancing for about 30 minutes like crazy to my favorite music. This video was amazing Garrett. So relatable.
OMG I HAVE PSR I JUST TELL PEOPLE ITS LIKE IM ALLERGIC TO THR SUN😂
I watched the entirety of Naruto and Shippuden in under a month. I'm exhausted.
Love those bug drawings! So cute :0
I've been on Discord making cool new friends
Pretending/assuming this was your real life I’ve gotta say that you are very entertaining but I really couldn’t live or work with you because of how easily you get distracted and how little you get done lol
oh so theyre literally married now ok then
Your videos always make me so happy 🥺💗
Anybody still got “Now I’m a Baby” stuck on their head? Lol
Garrett is what a Labrador be as a human.
I'm watching and listening to soothing, kind of boring media. Time Team and History of English podcast. I need their dulcet tones to convince me it's all going to be ok. Plus stories of war and plague, fun!
Idk what I'm doing to stay sane, but I watched a video today featuring 11 bugs with wings taking off in flight in slow motion. So. THAT.  Let me tell you, it's WORTH IT. A bunch of them stretch out superman style (Fireflies/lightning bugs look like flying squirrels while they fly due to how they move their legs out of the way), some of them go upside down or sideways haphazardly like they can't carefully control their flight, which I love, and one of them in this video (an aphid) just like lifts off and rocks back and forth like a rigid rocking horse as it takes off. It's GLORIOUS. It's by some channel called "Ant lab" and features a bug expert, Dr. Adrian Smith, and the video is titled "Insect Flight | Capturing Takeoff & Flying at 3,200 FPS." It's hilarious. I tend to think of bugs as little robots, so it's even better to see their behavior in slow mo, and see how imperfect and random (but nonetheless effective, and weirdly endearing) their movement can be.
I just wanna know if Garret finished his emails
garrett and andrew are cottagecore babies
That ass
I am the doll in the popcorn bowl
Mini series of Washington *PUH-lease*
All of us are garret during quarantine
Love the Dollar Shave Club body wash.
Over quarantine I’ve been trying to reread all my favorite childhood books!
STAN so hard the fact that youre taking covid seriously <3 <3 <3  <3
I thought Garrett left YouTube
I’ve been hanging out with my dog and cat, plus I got a new friend a few weeks a ago! A little kitten named August! He’s quickly becoming all of our best friends! Just what I needed to make “August” better! 😄
is anyone thinking what im thinking... is pot baby Garret.. cause like the "three judgmental friends"... two are wearing blue diapers and ones wearing pink...
Just the frame of Andrew cradling that phenomenal knitted baby yoda.. 😤 so pure
For the question at the end of the video: im on a journey to do summer salts in every room of my house and standing in the corner for two minutes for each one
Grapefruits are green in august needs to be my ringtone
“I am just helping you get on track” “you want to talk about tracks, there is a TRAIN down the ROAD!” 😂😂😂 thank you for making me laugh, needed this video!!
ive picked up a hobby of gardening!! i have mint, basil, a little mini lemon tree (he's tiny and his name is gwenith), a whole buncccchh of cacti's, and dwarf banana tree ( who's name is regae). im also aBSOLOUTELY OBSESSED with this anime that's called kakeguri (go check it out is super good)
i need an andrew in my life
citrus is a winter fruit lol
Please give us a night in my life pleeeeeeaaaaase
stop calling it quarantine.
My roommate and I learned to play Beat Saber in quarantine! It's a fun little escape, but it can also be good exercise once you've played long enough at certain levels.  Glad you are doing well Garrett! Thank you for making me laugh and for reminding us that even in this strange new world, we can still have fun. Hope everyone stays safe and healthy!
Is no one else seeing the subtle shade being thrown towards Shane when Garrett says ‘shame’ at 25:44 and ‘train’ at 26:02 or is it just me? I feel like the entire squirrel sweater skit is an analogy for Shane and Jeffree’s relationship that started during the Shane and Jeffree series. Garrett and Andrew are acting out this way of thinking to prove a point to Shane about how pointless and self centered his relationship/obsession/allegiance to Jeffree really is. Anyone else pick up on this? It was hard to word it so I hope it made sense
Ah, I went to playing Neopets again during this quarantine xDDI can't believe the side is still alive
playing with my dogs i have 4 of them pug terrier mix. they are so cute especially in their little christmas outfits lol also installed a hummingbird feeder so we can watch them while were outside yayyyy
in quarantine I've been playing with my dog Susie
Wait so not everyone sneezes or feels like they have to sneeze when they look at the sun or it’s really bright out
garret you seem so fun i wish you were my friend lol id never be bored
I need to know if the lady with the wine has a name.
Ugh. I love you. Lol like wish you were my best friend. I need this energy in my life
I need moreeeee
I missed your videos !!! (And Andrew’s laugh LOL) glad you’re back
Please make a night video! Also, I’ve been watching a lot of Steven Universe. It’s amazing! If you haven’t seen it, I would watch the whole series and movie.  You get a lot of feelz from it. Love it.
Garrett and Andrew together is my aesthetic
Anyone just sitting here like u sleep with socks on...
If  you finish this whole video. You're literally a big fan. Adios!!! hahaha
milk and vodka HAHAHA
OMG! My son sneezes when he goes outside! He’s 4 and somehow KNEW, with no one telling him, that it’s the sun that makes him sneeze! He says ‘the sun makes me all sneezy’...I figured you would like to know that  Also he has pet rocks and wants to be The Hulk for Halloween bc Hulk doesn’t get boo boos and likes the color Orange the best. I feel as though you two would hit it off! Haha.
Omg the Keyboard moment
Garret let’s be honest, if bad guys break into your house, you’re probably jumping out the window with a wand in one hand, the infinity gauntlet on the other, and the pregnancy pillow around your neck like a scarf
Yes I would love to see, “a night in my life” video😂
The fact that I watched this 39 minute video and it felt like 15 minutes just shows how much I enjoy watching garrets videos.
I have been going on walks, hanging with my best friend and her only!! And I've been cuddling with my animals just trying to stay sane!!!
YOU GUYS SPENT MONTHS IN WASHINGTON AND DIDNT TELL US??? GARRETTTTT 😫
Hey, get on that music stuff. It would be so great!
This video is everything my short attention span needed
Cool video, Did Enjoy.
We miss you :( ..
GAR I MISSED THIS INNOCENT SOFT BITCH
Wait, y'all get dressed?
Let's take a moment to point out how great Andrew looks. He looks like he's gotten fit
Ah yes andrew
I desperately need your "night in my life" video hahaha
i got so sad when he said there was no andrew on the couch 🥺
to answer your question of what i have been doing to make me feel better during quarantine is: watching LOTS of criminal minds, baking A LOT, and binge watching your videos. i have probably rewatched each of them 3 times.
100% in for A Night In My Life
Literally one of the only YouTubers I actually don't fast forward past their sponsor.👑
Was that really Garrett singing? I thought it was a lip synch but nooo. 😱😱😱 Amazing!
I missed your face so much!!! Thank you for making me laugh with your awesomeness.....also DO NOT EVER stop being you! Hope you are doing well and as for what I am doing to keep mind occupied in quarantine is just a lot for self renovation trying my hardest to not focus on all the crap that is going on in the world and just trying to become a better version of myself.
Lockdown in the UK has been far from fun but like two months into it I moved into a new house with a Pond like full of frogs and I have named them all after Torchwood characters for very specific reasons and they have been one of my pure ass sources of joy. I've just been holding them and talking to them to feel better, it's like therapy but cheaper and you come out of it smelling like a pond.
t-the good vibes...I can't...it makes me so so happy...WAAAAAA No but seriously, I can't stop laughing and I'm also waiting for Garrett's musical debut-
I started a new hobby over Quarantine/Lockdown of nail stamping.
Wait you should paint your roof...
Garrett, I missed you!!!! I loveeeee youuuuu!!!! 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ & Ofcourse  Andrewww, love the way both of you laughhh!!!!!
why do I wanna cuddle with sleepy andrew?
✨garret watts and shane dawson are not the same person✨
I've started drawing on my phone  and I'm actually happy to say I'm good at it and I spend ages listening to music while I draw
Ive missed you on here so much. ♥️ One thing I've done to feel better is take time to try some new recipes to cook and also started recorded random fun videos(which ive never done).
can we appreciate how the subtitles spelt crochet 'crowshay'
is no one going to address that those texts said 12:20 AM lol
during quarantine, I like to play my ukulele and watch loads of anime.
Garrett!!! Please post more 🥺😁
🎶Grapefruits are green in August🎶   Honestly his voice was amamzing in this
I worry about your health
Does anyone else want to talk about how Tiger King feels like it happened in the 90s?
For the question: I've been watching a lot of PMSeymore's late night tumbler videos they're really funny and they tend to brighten my mood
This makes me so happy
I’ve been buying stuff to make me feel better 🙈🙈 and i’ve been painting and watching anime😛
YES WE WANT A NIGHT IN YOUR LIFE
garrett is what would happen if dwight schrute and micheal scott had a son
i will never leave the house without a pocket skeleton again
Needed this video ❤️
Garrett. We’ve missed you. I’ve missed you. Thank you for this.
‘Did you hear a spider?!’ 🤣🤣🤣
I’ve been trying to see how long I can stay on a call with friends cause why not
What is not to LOVE about this kid
Ok but your voice is iconic, we need more singing videos!!!
u look like freddie dredd but gay. and I love it.
I actually recently got into a car accident going to work and have been in the hospital since (it's been about a week, btw I'm stable and about to go home in a few days) but while I've been here and even before this happened I talk to my amazing partner and do a lot of arts and crafts. Recently it's been a lot of sun catchers. I get discharged soon which means I'll be able to see my partner on almost a daily basis now. Which was my usual coping mexh with the insane world around us. Anyways if you got this far, thank you and please be safe.
My favorite thing to do in quarantine is watch Garett watts of course...
Pls don’t disappear again for months 🥺
for some reason... I really want that pocket skeleton.
“You want to talk about tracks, I think there’s a train down the road”
‘A man never forgets his first broom..’ 🤣🤣🤣
Who else got instantly happy seeing Garret uploaded a video!!! 😁
I honestly wish that you would make more content!! I laugh insanely hard every time I watch one of your videos!!!!
Yesss for the night time video!!
i've spent the last 5 months w my dog, my family and watching andrew rannells interviews 😔..........✨ stream black monday on the SHOWTIME app 😌✨
I just noticed that Andrew sounds like Remy from Ratatouille.
24:24 crowshay
watching naruto and taking hot shower :) love you garrett!
To answer his question, the only thing I have done in quarantine is buy plants, name them, then marry them to each other. I'm weird! P.S. I love you Garrett!!!
32:20 really just turned into les miserables hahaha
This is the first video by Garrett I've ever watched, and TBH the chaotic energy was weirdly calming cause the whole time I was just like "same dude" lmao so great haha
This quarantine I just rewatched Naruto from the beginning.  Still not done but I know there’s something to do if I have nothing else.
This quarantine I just rewatched Naruto from the beginning. Still not done but I know there’s something to do if I have nothing else.
The simulation is resetting
he’s back <3
Making friendship bracelets
Adorable!
I missed Garrett 🥺🥺💗✨
Andrew + Garratt = Andratt or Garratt + Andrew = Gandrew?      I prefer the second one
THEY WENT TO WASHINGTON krifuejenfkfu 😭😭
his energy is simply so infectious
god i think im in love
Garrett:Hasn't posted in 5 months  Also Garrett : Gets 1.7 million views in 5 days
Love and missed you Garret. Also- Andrew in the cap and the earphones on the phone > 😏
YOU JUST MADE MY WHOLE DAY I MISSED YOU AND ANDREW SO MUCH IM CRYING
I need a pregnancy pillow
I'd love to see a sword fight with a ghost.
Imagine, once you die,  you only see black until someone pulls off your VR headset and asks "So, how was it" You reset at the age you most loved and then you pick your next life
Thank you Garrett, I needed this. Your eccentricity is my normal and I haven’t binged your vids for months. Gotta get back to that to keep me grounded.
Pixielocks music 💕💕🎶🎵
Garrett are you sure you can eat off those plates?
I know this is so random since it was just 3 seconds of the whole video but holy sh-t your cousins baby is sooo cute😭💕
I’ve been hanging out with my dog A LOT. That’s what I’ve been doing during quarantine.
PSR gang rise up
I started cross stitching while in quarantine. Never did it before and just jumped into an advanced one 😂 it’s been a lot of hours of watching YouTube on how to do certain stitches/knots, and as of right now I am about half way done it. I started in early April. I actually really love it and I am totally going to do more! Would not have discovered it if not for this whole crazy situation we are in!
Major Michael Scott Energy o.o
I love how in his baking a cake for a rat video he said that he would never get a microwave because they are spooky and now he has one and keeps his not microwave safe plates in it 😂
Yaaaaas pineapple puzza
MAKING UR BED ISNT GOOD THO- edit: garrstt is the Gun Guy: Sword Edition
I would love to tour his house and find every most random interesting things he have
Sun sneezers UNITE!!!!!
was that REALLY As The World Falls Down? I mean...Im not surprised, but still.
I love Garret’s laugh 😭😭🥰 idk why but it makes me happy
Garrett...as someone who has lived in Washington their whole life, hearing you talk about it and being amazed by it is really touching for some reason? anyways thank you the pnw appreciates it lol
Missed your videos so much 😭
"I have GOT to get this worked out!" -Me with 23 days left before school starts and 1 book and a half to read, do a reading log for I and an essay + Questions for the second. Plus 2 seasons of the west wing' with questions for AP Gov 😭😭😭   Plus extreme procrastination
Jeez garret wats wrong with ur mind
I’ve been watching fruits basket anime, listening to new music/playing new games, got back into drawing, and I work at build a bear workshop which has been interesting :)
But actually they did more than I do in a day in quarantine
to feel good this year I have been obsessively watching avatar the last airbender and pretending to water bend when I take showers
I loved this!!  I’ve been painting picture frames we already have and printing pics for them. And then hanging them up and moving them around different shelves 😆 I enjoy the painting and sanding and trying different tricks. Then once I have a pic in and choose where to place it, the fresh new decor makes me happy. I like looking at what I made.
I'm so mad that he didn't sound bad tho. 😂. "But in july" made me laugh so hard
I would 100% watch just unedited footage of andrew and garrett in Washington
“Why are you yelling at me?”  Garrett: *so you have chosen death*
I’ve been watching a lot of new TV and movies like Avatar: The Last Airbender and Aliens (1986)!! ❤️
You make my day all the time!!
I stg if you posted more you'd be like the biggest youtuber ever this is comedic gold.... really filling the pure, good clean fun void Jenna marbles left.
ive never seen andrew all riled up like this before lmao
Garrett is exactly what this quarantine needs
Garret! That figurine of a man with a flute is a vasque (baske) txistu player, or a baske man playing a txistu (a super interesting baske imstrument). At least is what it seems to me, an ex baske-argentinian txistu player.
Making ridiculously tiny plastic haribos :)
Is no one asking where he got his Baby Yoda from?😝
Andrew is a clikkie, I HAVE THE SAME SHIRT AS ANDREW
i hope you’re doing well today Garret. i hope your leftover pizza was good and that your squirrel got your sweater. tell the bug mansion lady i say hi ❤️
You’re awesome Garrett!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
It was so great to see you both in videos again! I have been trying to read and unplug from the internet for at least a few hours everyday... mixed results. I also try to go on long walks at least once a week (I bring a mask with me in case I run into people, but generally I opt for quiet areas.  Stay healthy and safe <3
Garrett is exactly what this quarantine needs
I would like to know more about the terrible festival in Spain. That bighead man breaking his thing killed me 😂💗
Personally, during quarantine, I've been working out. Specifically, I've been doing Chloe Ting's workouts. It's made me feel a lot better. And, I've noticed a pretty good change physically.
I became a witch AND a weeb
wait some people dont sneeze at the sun?
Lets make garret Rich!!! Buy as many as merch from him so he can make more videos and buy an life coach/planner
Can we just appreciate how much of a mess this video is and how adorable Andrew and Garrets friendship is 😂 I love this video so much
Is that Rick Deckard on your shelf?
Yo, don't be ashamed of your pregnancy pillow. People that would talk shit don't know what they're missing. Pregnancy pillows should just be super essential pillows that everyone has, because they're amazing. NORMALIZE PREGNANCY PILLOWS!! Lol. Also you'll need the sword to protect your pregnancy pillow from being taken in the night. Also you should maybe not eat off those plates. They were meant to be decorative and since they were made in the 70's there's a good possibility that there's lead in the paint and/or the actual plate itself. And the outside edge is some type of real metal so don't microwave them either lol
Garrett you make my heart feel so full when I see you uploaded. ❤ Also a vlog from your time in Washington pls let it happen!
Is this a letterkenny episode lmao
I thought u were dead
these two are just adorable!
ITS A LITTLE CUP THAT I USE FOR MY FINGER WHEN I CRUNCH IT
Ok but Garrett has the power to make literally anyone smile at any time, there is the X-Men power mkay
Garret Watts: the purest embodiment of Chaotic Good
yes garret, i HAVE been watching anime and only anime to make myself feel better, specifically yuri on ice... i’ve rewatched it like 8 times😁
I learned to play the harmonica and baked/cooked a lot during quarantine PS. Your videos always make me so happy and the fact that they are so rare makes them even more special Thank you Garrett (and Andrew), love you
you had me until i saw the pineapple on that pizza
When he said “Speaking of grooming” I literally thought he was going to give us the tea on Shane. ☕️🤭
20:19  That’s what she said
Where can I find that Harry Potter shirt?
Your so fucking wholesome and I love watching you!  I haven't smiled this much in so long ...
can you please do another cleaning video lol
I love that you posted this now iv been in the hospital and its taken me 3 days to watch this but its somehow made the stay a little bit better
i’ve started to do some digital drawing, listening to new tunes (ie hikaru utada’s entire 20+ year discography and artists like rico nasty!), and reading A LOT!!
I love Garrett's content more than anything on the internet. What a pure sweet soul ♡ I'd kill to be his friend
Washington girl, born and raised. Recently moved to Nevada....ughhh!
Okay but the cute little thing he did for them to eat pizza🤍🤍🥺🥺🥺🥺
I’ve been watching all of your old videos , sleeping, eating, and breathing :)
I am VERY annoyed that y’all were in Washington and I did not get to see y’all
I’m litterally 16 and my pregnancy pillow is like my favorite thing
Plllleeeeaaaaase make more videos! 😂🙌🏼😆🦥
Wait, August? So you actually filmed and uploaded this in the same month? Way to go, Garrett!
Anime is my go-to for getting me through quarantine! (Currently My Hero Academia)   Also, online gaming helps a ton too! Socializing while playing a good game is perfect! ♡
Some days are a little stressful but my daughter is going back to school only twice a week the rest home schooled and I'm still working, and I'm a single mom so yay!! Fun 😬😀🤯🥴 you are absolutely hilarious btw!!
I've been watching Hillsong channel to feel better
..andrew cuffs his sleeves..what if him and garret marry each other and become cottagecore hubbys
Okay can we just have more garret and Andrew adventures please
Idk why this gives me strong Alton Brown/Good Eats vibes.
Okay so that’s why i sneeze when i look into the sun, when i was younger i used to tell my cousins about it but they find it weird and im surprised cuz i thought its everyone’s normal reaction when looking directly into the sun 😄
me: struggling with uni and my life is just falling apart garrett: its ok we're in a pandemic  me: :)
This.is .the.best video I've seen by far during the quarantine! I love this! The chaos the energy and Andrew, I mean amen😏
me: :( Garrett and Andrew having a pizza party/date on the roof: me: :)
This is the longest day in the life video ever. Lol I love it. Also I love the grapefruit song. You're good at singing
And by days I mean months - lol same
14:32 you're welcome 🍏
You digress so much ..there was like 193802 different topics in one video 😂
I never know I need these until I’m 15 mins in smiling like I haven’t in months!
I've been breeding snails over quarantine 😂 I've learned way more about snail genetics than I care to admit, but I've now got 300+ aquatic snails so, I figure that's a win.
I watch your videos Garrett to feel better cause they make me laugh out loud. My parents constantly walk into my room at night telling me to be quiet cause I laugh so much. Also painting or having dance party’s by myself in my room works wonders to. You’re awesome Garrett let’s be friends. I’m from New Zealand, After Covid come here let’s hang.
I need to see a vid of you and Andrew in Washington.. that will help me get through Quarantine
please clean your eyeglasses garrett  love u ^^
i've been hanging out with my friend group that  i've been quarentined with and have learned some new dances
omg yes a night in my life
Garrett never fails to make me smile
I'm no longer quarantined, but when I was I played a ton of video games I never thought I would have time to play, took some online classes, perfected my cooking skills which made me save money instead of ordering or eating out. I also thought a lot about my goals and started to work on them and gained motivation. Now I'm working again and it's been hard to keep some of my good habits from quarantine, but I've been trying! I know staying at home sucks for such a long period of time, but I'm sure everyone can try and do something for themselves specially if you live alone or dont have small kids. Now is a good time :)
Thank God garret exist Cuz I am SICK of Shane😲
I’ve been slowly changing my room into a space where I can be at my most comfortable. For the 3 years I’ve been struggling to make my room feel like my safe place and I set out to make it happen! ✨🧚🏻🌸🌈🥳
NIGHT IN A LIFE yesssss please
UPLOAD MORE PLEASE WE MISSED YOU 🥺😭
Like if you’ve reconnected with someone during quarantine
"best friends on a roof, pizza party, ....got a magazine about bread-ed-ed"
I just kept nearly breaking my ankles while trying to learn skate tricks :)
God this is such a mood
Can we all just agree to move on from Shane to Garret? I watched them both but like it would be so funny if Shane lost all his subscribers and Garret gained the all
Answer to the question: Tarot readings, like for real, and stuff related to that. I've learned a lot about fair folk, meditating and just anything and any internet spiral related
I love them so much and I'm so happy they are doing their own thing now :')
I missed Andrews laughter behind the camera. Also... Literally my favorite two beans.
Loved hearing Andrews's laugh. Garett you have an amazing singing voice I don't know why Andrew made you get off the roof. Laughing my ass off from down under. I found your channel through Shane tell Shane there is a gap in the internet since he got canceled utter horse $@#%.
FINALLY
this is my fav thing of today (it's only 2:33am but, you know.. starting strong.)  I'm so high, but I laughed so much and it was so needed lol
You guys are so cute ily thank you for spreading positive vibes and being yourselves Over quarantine ive been playing animal crossing new leaf and i picked up painting! Cds bags rocks I've painted a lot since quarantine 😁 I've also been trying to convince my mom to let me have a pet rat too lol
Garrett gives golden retriever vibes
Garrett, I love everything about you and I am always so excited when I see you’ve uploaded a new video. If we ever met in person we would be best friends because I would pursue you persistently until you gave in. Don’t ever change!
i've been making plushies
Garrett watts is how i act when im alone
Wth im literally watching this at 4am hugging my body pillow 😂😂😂
Now this, i can relate to
Post more!!! Post more!!!!!! Post more!!!!!!!!!!!  Lol every time you post I smile for whatever the length of your video is!  I hope you can find time to post more. You’re missed on here ❤️
Wait, you’re telling me that halftime show was THIS YEAR?
2 years ago, a venture was started.  The idea was Big, and Dreamy.  Yet it didn't stop us from trying to work it out.  People who heard about our idea mocked us, humiliated us, underestimated us.  Our own family turned their backs, friends abandoned us and we were mocked when asked for support and help.  For 2 years, A man worked on this entire project by himself. Despite the criticism and discouragement, he kept moving forward. He longed for a team and finally the Team was born 2 months ago.  Dear friends and colleagues, when we started the venture 2 months ago, our 15 domains were hacked. We have been banned from all social media paid ads. Our social media accounts have been hacked multiple times. Our official mail and data were hacked. Our phones and laptops were hacked and tracked.  Yet, we didn't stop. We started this whole start up from zero financial support. And here we are today. We don't have an investor, yet our company is self-sustaining by its nature. We didn't aim small, we aimed Big, and today the Big shot companies have already logged into our application curious enough to see what's the hype is all about.  Today we have a team of 80 Indian Interns, a Team of software engineers, a Team of Ad agency, a Team of Production, a Team of BPO, a Team of Technical engineers accounting for about 150 personals.  We have students across International borders and the Nation’s youth. We are the proud group of Youngsters, who brought forth the entire idea into reality. 10 days ago, many of you didn't know each other. You didn't know you could bring 10 international students to our company each. You didn’t realise the span of marketing happening in other social media platforms. You could have never even believed a group of 5 people brought together a team of 250 here.  This is what we are capable of. We believed in our idea. And we worked on it. And the right team supported us. We are the Proud Youngsters of this Nation.  We have built our National Brand Today across every International Market!  We made this happen TOGETHER. Presenting our website: https://im-branding.com/  Wait. There is More...!!  We have just started! ��  IM WORLD is our last stop.  Thank you From IM Branding.
Adult Paint-by-Numbers.  Because I don't have any talent, but painting is fun.
anime and self care and my rats
I think I dm you like 2 years ago but you didn’t see it but I hope you see this.. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH YOU UNPROBLEMATIC KING
Me up 3:45 am watching Garret talk about being lost in “time” during quarantine 👁👄👁
I hope you got to your emails
Garrey the platypus
CROWSHAY HE WROTE IN THE CAPTIONS FOR CROCHET I LOVEEEE IT
over this time I started streaming on twitch, doing tiktok, and drawing everyday. It's been really nice honestly.
MY BRAIN LOVES THIS :D
Garret and Andrews relationship is everything I strive to have!  Like going to Washinton together and hanging out 24/7 and Andrew, god he's incredible, he's done sm to help Garret, they can have a good laugh but he's also honest with him and tells him when he needs to stay focused, that's a good friends ,!  Also to answer your question I've been calling and talking and hanging with my boy bsf/crush lots to keep me happy :))  Anyways stay healthy and safe please love you!  ♥️♥️
Garret, did I say that I love you already? If not then, I love you :* <3 Saranghae

PUT GRAPEFRUITS ARE GREEN EXTENDED EDITION ON SPOTIFY NOW
I slept for 2 days straight and my sleep schedule is that I sleep all day and stay awake all night       I PHYSICALLY CAN NOT SLEEP AT NIGHT  NO MATTER HOW MICH SLEEP I GET
“It’s a little cup that I use when I crunch it” 😂😭
Wall the ad for this video for me is a naked lady
I've been feeling like poop during this quarantine! and something that's been helping me get back some serotonin has been looking at old sketchbooks and realizing how far I've come and that has been a great motivator to produce more work regardless of the garbage status of the world. :) your chaotic-random tweets also help haha
About the sneezing by looking at the sun;  my bestie not only does that, but she literally can provoke a sneeze by looking at me when I'm standing in direct sunlight, because that's how pale I am.
thank you for existing ♡
i got into propmaking! i've made wands, some swords, some armor for a friend's Shrek cosplay - idk what i want to make next but i feel like i could actually do it :D
i kinda want yall to fu........
i NEED a 'a night in my life' video ASAP!!! this gave me life
I been doing a bunch of painting and drawing my room is covered in paintings that I have done
You guys are too adorable 😎🤓
Watercolors, gardening
Love them both!!  Their friendship seems so genuine.   Everyone who has a best friend I am sure you can relate!!!
I've been fostering lots of kittens (from bottle-feeding to adoption). I just finished getting my last litter adopted out a week ago and yesterday a nest of baby squirrels fell out of a tree and we couldn't get the parents to retrieve them, so now I'm rehabilitating baby squirrels! I've never done it, but I'm a vet tech and have some experience with raising infant animals and I also have some people I can turn to if things aren't going as planned. I'm so excited for this new journey though! Anyway, yeah that's how I've been keeping myself fulfilled/busy/entertained in quarantine lol
And to answer the question -- I've been binging on Degrassi, cuddling my Bearded Dragon, and trying to get out of the house even if its just to check the mail or walk around the block.
come back to spain, i want to meet you!
PLEASE do A Night In My Life!! I would watch that
Things I've realized:   1) I AM Garrett 2) Andrew is basically Spongebob in the episode where Mr. Krabs goes on a date with Mrs. Puff and Spongebob is trying to keep him from spending money and then Mr Krabs gets mad LOL
Garrett + Andrew: B o y f r i e n d s <3
🚨Biggest scandal ALERT 🚨  In a fit of rage and disillusion, Garrett Watts yells in a fit due to the mass rejection of his animalistic modern look on rodent apparel, causing collateral damage of pot clanking and threatening a good time of train watching.
I’ve been going outside in the mornings when I can to just sit and watch the birds. We have a bunch of bird feeders outside our house and we get all kinds of birds. My favorite are the blue jays and humming birds
I was having Andrew withdrawls.
This is so entertaining I want to throw up.
drawing!
Watching avatar has been my only emotional support over quarantine
wow i never knew my sun sneeze had a name
This is all I need is Garrett's vids 🥰
he doesn't have food in his fridge but he has multiple fruit trees in his year lol
OMG ANDREW AND I HAVE THE SAME TØP SHIRT
Please do a night in my life!!
how long do you guys think garretts gonna leave that stuff on his roof because i know he didnt put everything away when he was done
When he mentioned the SuperBowl performance, I was shook. I had to go look it up make sure he wasn’t lying, seems like such a distant memory.
ur reviving me
garett you’re honestly one of my favourite people in the world
i- is that a framed picture of mertal snow from ahs coven?... oh you shouldn't  have
Me @ my Friend who is entering my house: 2:42
You2 s greatest merch idea
Im a night owl as well
dude why are you  so funnyyyyyyyyyyy
Garret is the perfect personification for my inner monologue and Andrew is the perfect personification for my outer monologue hahahah
IM SO HURT, your figure is sold out😭 Garrett, Benjamin, Harry Potter, what more could you ask for?
OH MY GOODNESS ME AND GARRETT WATTS HAVE THE SAME GLASSES!!!!
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SNEEZED EVERY MORNING AND I DIDNT KNOW THERE WAS A NAME FOR IT. I am part of 18%. Kool.
Andrew sleeping with a baby Yoda is the cutest thing ever!! 😁
Your grapefruit song fuggin slaps
🥺hes such an innocent bean, like bruh he has A MORNING SNEEZE
I laughed way too hard at this 🤓
Started therapy mid quarantine to feel better because all other coping mechanisms lost their charm and effectiveness. That, and brownies. So many trays of brownies.
i...i.i thought everyone sneezes at the sun
Yesss! "We all need to learn to be like that squirrel!!"
please do the video
What I do during this crazy time is that I play video games and doing school work and going to virtual gaming events in college to reconnect with my old friends.
Lil Dicky? 32:50
Me crocheting while watching this 👀
You should collar with Rhett n Link :D
ok but... where did you get that crocheted baby yoda plush 🥺👉🏼👈🏼
I wanna be his friend
Through quarantine I finally cleaned my room and got it to way I wanted it to be! Plus my friend and I got back into anime so WEVE been finally going through our watchlist and it’s been so fun
Garrett actually has a decent singing voice I-
I’m so happy to see you guys again!! Omg and I’ve been trying kpop lately, BLACKPINK and Red Velvet are mad good. I never thought I’d hop on the train but here I am haha it’s been fun.
PSR gang 🤙🏼✨
You are so pure I’ll protect you at all costs😭❤️
I hate that i’m six days late to the video.
"His birthdays on the 9th, he's turning 19" while false for Andrew, I did turn 19 on the 9th lmao.  Answer to the end of the vid question : I've been working at Wendy's through most of Covid but in my off time, I picked up streaming, got affiliated on twitch, started cross stitching and now I'm in the beginning process of starting my own small business! Cross stitching was something my late grandmother loved and I wanted to feel closer to her after she passed in March.
WAAAAAAIIIITT does anyone know what he uses to hang his wands on his wall ??
I think I smiled through this WHOLE ASS VIDEO
Times felt exactly like that 0:35
ive been watching ASMR! if you don't watch it already garrett, you should do a video reacting to ASMR for the first time!
Garretts videos never fail to make me smile:) Especially when andrew laughs in the background when he shows us his tiny friends that live in the bathroom
I too, sneeze in the sun. Now I know why.
"what's something you've been doing over quarantine to feel better" I've been spending lot of time with my best friend and just really nurturing that friendship. He came up with the idea to send each other a playlist of 10 songs that we love, so every week I get a playlist from him (and I send him one too of course) and it's a great way to listen to new music and artists. We talk about which ones we liked most and for what reasons, we've done it for I think 10 weeks now so that's 100 songs from each of us lol, but its so fun, and after we both talk about the songs we talk for a few more hours before either of us have to go. Listening to new music is my favorite thing to do and I get to do it with my best friend so it always makes me feel good. Also his taste is slightly different from mine but we always seem to find favorites in each other's playlist!
Woah I’m literally one day older than Andrew muahahaha
Painting little paintings on my nails
I go on walks where I can look at pretty flowers and bees and sometimes I meet cats and snails and frogs. And there was a hedgehog once and I crossed the road with a Fox. Also podcasts feel like a social situation with no anxiety. Xx please make content more, you're such a lovely,original and interesting person x
this whole video happens in my brain every 15 seconds tbh so i feel you garret
I’ve been drawing a lot of little sweet monster bois from my brain to bring some form of joy in my life during quarantine. It’ll change your life 🤘🏾😌✨
Garrett I hope one day I can meet you, and we can spend the day shopping  at  like Yankee candle or something 😂😂. Lmfao the most random thing but seriously💜
“I’m a bit of a disaster.”  Me too, Garrett. Me too.
Garrett and Andrew together is literally everything😂😂❤❤ Watching these videos will make going to school more bearable😂❤
uppercut to the moon hahahahhaha where can I buy your personality
“You’re a Band-aid on my ass!” Lmaooo what even
YAYYYY YOUR BACK!!
During the lockdown, I’ve been watching all of the marvel movies in order which I’ve never done before:’) and cross stitching
I think your PSR is cool🥺
Honestly stuff like this is what is getting me through quarantine. At first I was like omg this is like a 40 minute video, but all of Andrew and Garrett’s random humor and them laughing. This is great. When Garrett was joking about Andrew being the best boy, I couldn’t figure out why that seemed so familiar, but it made me immediately think of a skit from Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! 😂 But seriously 10/10 it was great catching up with Garrett and Andrew.
I cooked and ate mushrooms
Some things I've been doing to feel normal during quarantine: rewatching ATLA/LOK, watching a lot of YouTube, and I adopted two kittens who make every day a little bit brighter!
I finiahed a blanket I was crocheting before quarantine and started 2 other ones.
I started a garden on my balcony and knitted a pillow case!!!
Please make a "night in your life" video! This vid picked me up after a really bad day, your content is needed so much rn 🥺
That grapefruit song was the best thing to happen to me since March....
Ugh I really want pizza now
Also hey try playing Epic Mickey 2 with Andrew it’s one of the best games out there ❤️ U
Omg I have the sneezing reflex too hehehe
To feel better I actually have been drawing more while listening to podcasts it’s so calming and it makes time go faster I will draw a little bug next in your honor
i just got my wisdom teeth taken out like 2 days ago..... watching this put my in so much pain cause i could not stop laughing!!!
Seeing Garret being alive is making me cry tears of joy.
I feel like Andrew is a different person around Garrett than he is around Shane. Like he seems to be a kid again around Garrett, you can tell they're just whole heartedly best friends.
Omg Garrett I love you so much
Man, I have such bad PTSD, and one of my triggers is dissociation. Basically, dissociation feels kind of like when you're high and lose the sense of time. And at the start of quarantine, I was dissociating so bad every day. Literally had panic attacks daily. I was thinking about getting admitted to a psych ward or going to the hospital it was that bad. I dreaded every night. I would ball my eyes out for hours just because I was dissociating. I didn't know what it felt like to be alive, I genuinely thought I was dead. It felt like I was super high on weed all day every day. Sure, sounds fun. But just minus the giggles and add the occasional weed paranoia as well as feeling like time went by quickly and slowly at the same time. I never want to experience that ever again. I usually never cry from my panic attacks, but damn I would literally cry daily. It's gotten a little better. I just miss not being terrified.
Shane: *Getting cancelled*  Garret: Chile anyways so-    Hey guys it’s a Joke no toxicity here! Definitely not my intestine🤗
Guys it’s ok it’s just gray he’s throwing diseased pieces of rice at earth it will only end in death
Omg you're alive 😱
I sneeze from sudden sunlight, it's pretty funky
Does this mean that Andrew isn't friends or working with Shane anymore? :C
19:17 2020 in a nutshell
Yesssss I love Beatrix kiddo! ❤️ just got a Jeep and named her The Pussy Wagon
It was great watching you guys needed a good laugh please post more
Answering your question: I've been binge-watching documentaries and fighting with my neighbor(playing loud music) because he can't stop playing the flute almost inside my bedroom(through the window).😡😂
I started a gaming youtube channel in quarantine! It's not on this account that I'm commenting with but check out Ely Fox Gaming if you're interested :) I'm out of quarantine finally, so I can't record as much as I'd like but I want to keep it going!
I'm shook at the fact garret has a pregnancy pillow. True comfort right there
Got so distracted by your video I burnt my thumb while trying to switch the wax in my wax melter
I've been playing games or stuff that I loved when I was younger, and that is helping me a lot during this quarantine :3
The simulation is broken
14 hour later<3
I have been doing zoom calls every Saturday with my friends to keep a sense of normalcy and watching SO MANY k-dramas.
Animal crossing has saved my life honestly. It’s been the best because me and my friends visit each other on the game and all have one big call so we can talk to each other. We do this like once a week lmao
Ok but what house is garret in
I've never wanted anything more than to quarantine with Garrett and Andrew in Washington
Garrett, thank you for uploading. I reallllllly needed this. Did you see The Batman trailer and Gotham Knights gameplay? Former Marvel boi (when Daredevil was canceled I lost all interest)  but I think DC is taking over (again)
We missed you sooooo much and u motivate me every day luv u
The immense amount of privilege to have this problem of the days melding together when some of us that have jobs have continued with the same schedule through the pandemic.
I love you! You’re a beautiful soul! Thank you for existing!
every single video i watch of garrett just makes me fall more in love with the person he is. he’s genuinely one of my favorite humans beings ever simply for his personality. he’s just so incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about every little thing in his life and his energy is just immaculate. garrett is the type of person i wanna be when i grow up: someone who’s kind, funny, unique, and not afraid to be himself and to show others the things he loves and takes interest in. what a lovely human being who i hope never stops being this happy <3
I’ve been working 😿😿 gotta help people get their bread
Best Duo
Today I broke my beast friends mom's curtain rod and I got really nervous and all I could say is #cronk
i starting going on walks while listening to music- i picture music videos with my characters while i walk and honestly i get lost half the time so maybe dont do that-
garrett is the type of person that can make you instantly happy no matter what kind of day you are having
This is the content I NEEDED
Andrew and garret are lowkey cute together 👀👀
WE LOVE YOU & NEED MORE OF YOU JUST TALKING AND BEING YOU
Andrew sounds like ratatouille
GARRETT AND ANDREW AWWW I MISSED U
watching garrett is like seeing my adhd turn into a real human being. and i love it
Garrett and Andrew are such cuties. Hope their friendship lasts forever 💓
As a photic sneezer myself I can vouch that the morning sneeze is essential lol
just got paid on friday..... think i need a small garrett in my room
i've been watching/making tiktoks to make myself feel better during quarantine! it has surprisingly kept me sane enough during all of this which is good because usually hanging out with friends and getting out of my house would be the thing i do to kind of reset my... mind i guess? it would take away most of my "everything feels fake" feeling i always have, but tiktok has been a good enough replacement for that since i can't do that now
Why does this video literally sums up 2020?
I've been trying to meditate outside to feel better during quarantine, or take a walk in the forest :)
Tune in in 2 years for the A Night In My Life video!
Minute 28:49 Andrew : why do u have to throw everything?( at the back garden) Garrett : Ah,Andrew im not throwing everything! 1 sec later - Pwanggg!!! ( Round metal bin cover flying to the ground ) Lol!
I sleep with a sword too. I'm not lying. I also have a battle axe on my wall.
Damn I’ve missed this clown 😂😂😂
You too Andrew
I love you Garrett so much. Miss seeing you more
GRapEfrUiTs aRe gReeN iN aUgusTttttTttTt
i full on gasped when you put that skeleton in your pocket, i want a tiny skeleton to put in my pocket :O
JLo Shakira thing happened this year??? *SHUT UPPPPPP*
Over Quarantine : I've been hanging with my boyfriend and trying to teach my cat to not hate him haha.
Why is this the most relatable thing I’ve watched since corona started.
I wonder if Andrew left Shane for Garrett because honestly I'm LIVING for it tbh
Lovely to see you, truly a beautiful human you are and a funny guy for an added bonus!
First off Garrett I'm so glad to see that beautiful face and second I've been trying to become more social even through all this. I'm graduating college and I will finally have free time to do something.... haven't figured it out yet. But I'm so on board with ur video concept. Strange times my friend indeed but it's great to see ur well and beautiful and can't wait for the next one. Lotsa love ❣️
This video brought me so much happiness!!!
9:20 that brush is 100% from a Japanese hotel lol
Sun sneeze gang UNITE!!!
Still love your baby song so much that I purchased a set of babies! no not real ones...
We all need an Andrew.
The saddest thing in the world is people thinking Pizza Hut and dominos is pizza!!! It’s like the frozen pizza of the pizza world.
Why is his vibrato not so bad
I've been spending quarantine at home in Missouri, after spending one of the best half-years of my life at school in CHicago where I found amazing friends, love, a passion, and I was just 400x happier there. So when I came home I felt really depressed and I missed my friends and my happiness and everything felt horrible.   So to feel better, other than watching anime like I have been already, I got into cooking! I love cooking for other people, making it look all nice, and hearing what they have to say about it. I found some fun recipes like veggie flatbread and pumpkin blondies. It's really made me feel a lot better and more productive during a time where I can barely get myself up. It's so simple, and I'm not a cook by any means, but it really saved my sanity, ya know?
It feels like I'm watching a movie
I’ve been painting, drawing, journaling, cooking, and making tea with my husband! We’ve also been watching Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure and playing a ton of animal crossing.
I hope you see this, PLEASE DONT PUT THOSE PLATES IN THE MICROWAVE! They have gold on them the shiny can cause a fire 🔥 PLEASE DONT CATCH YOUR PLACE ON FIRE 🔥 2020 has been bad enough!
I came back to watch Garrett call Andrew a simp @25:00
I’ve been going back and getting platinum trophies for all the Assassin’s Creed games, I bet there are some games you could really crush if you wanted to!
Andrew and Garrett
Wait that sneeze thing is unique?
Um I thought we were still in March, anytime I say August it doesn’t feel real
Garrett, treat your stuff with respect
LMAOOOOOO WHEN GARRET WAS ON THE PIANO BAAHAHAHAH
Starting my new twitch streamer life during  quarantine its Smilemortis if anyone wants to follow :)
New tattoo idea: "grapefruits are green in august, not in july"
Does Garrett have a day-to-day job besides youtube?
No one: Me: *for some stupid reason imagines them falling in through the roof-*
I needed this. Thank you Garrett and Andrew ❤️❤️❤️
Dude, I had no clue he could sing!!! I'm Shook-ith to my core!!!
I just LOVE Garrett ❣️🤣☺️ I wish I was his type. And preferred gender🤭🤣🤣
Answer: teaching my son sign language and buying a new face mask.
legend has it, Garrett still hasn't done his emails
I’m sad he’s gay, I would love a boyfriend like him.
0:37 and 0:39 YES
Most of this video I'm wondering where Garrett bought his shirt. We would make great friends
Next video:  pimp my roof top🤣🤣
I spent most of the quarantine working and it led to my mental health taking a hit so I quit and I've been spending most of my time watching TV shows that I have already seen because they make me feel comfortable and my dog is my TV buddy so he helps too. I wish this could help me a lot but unfortunately it's not and the fact that I'm struggling in every way possible it's just bad but I'm hoping things get better at some point lol. Also, I do too have random skeletons around my house haha I just kept my Halloween decorations around because I love Halloween and frankly, I want Halloween to be around all year long so I figured why not make it happen. This video made me laugh and helped me a lot so thank you, you're a great person!
Nice one dace
feeling better during quarantine? funny. i have instead been slowly drifting into this dark abyss of life, watching the world around me swim in chaos.
Omg I learned to crochet over quarantine too! 🙂
The sun actually makes me nauseous, but then I sneeze and it goes away lol
A kpop artist 'MINO' from the group SHINee has the same thing Garrett. He walks out into the sun and sneezes. Here's a short 8 sec clip of it https://youtu.be/p_qBS4cVFc8 Just know your not the only one😋
Okay but i want that ghost content and night in his life
Over quarantine I’ve just been collecting dead bugs around my house because there pretty see you in five-one month(s) garret!
Well...I leaned something new.I am part of that 18% that sneeze when looking at the sun😋❤
I love y’alls friendship!!!!
Am i a queen?👸
the amount of serotonin made in this video is astronomical
To feel better over quarantine I've been writing letters!! I've done it enough to make it a hobby with wax seals and everything:)
My man moved in right before quarantine so when I felt low I just cuddled the absolute heck out of him.  Fully recommend it.  Specifically you have to cuddle *my* man though.  It just won't work with anyone else, I'm sorry.
Nobody makes me laugh as much as Garret Watts.. hysterical comedic genius. 😂
i have been dressing up in cosplay! it literally makes me feel super!! And I am also taking online courses for fun!!
im in love with garrett lol
I've been eating edibles to stay sane to be honest.
got my very first job during quarantine which is super ironic
Andrew and Garrett are such amazing people 🥺💜
Tag yourself, I’m pot baby 😂
I’ve been extra sad lately since my last little pet mouse died, but driving around my hometown for hours always takes my mind off things. Something about being in a different space playing my music so loud that my thoughts go quiet is so peaceful
OH MY GAWD!   "You want some milk and vodka? "😂😂😂
I’ve rewatched Hamilton 14 times. That’s how I cope.
hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!! 8:38
Me who lives in Washington finding out Garrett was literally in my state 👁👄👁
So excited for ghostly content! Going to be amazing!
I started listening to Gorillaz regularly!! That's been the only good part of my quarantine but i have thoroughly enjoyed it
But you do HAVE an actual toothbrush, yes?
I got a new pet! His name is Freddie after Freddie Murcery lol
my quarantine has already ended because of school which im not even mad about
One thing that I have been doing through quarantine to help me feel better is cooking using my parents' recipes. I live on the other side of the country from them and they were supposed to come to California for my  birthday in April, but could not because of covid. So I had my first birthday without my parents this year. So, I have been using their recipes of some of my favorite meals from childhood to bring me comfort and make me feel closer to them. Its cheesy, but it really has helped me to feel more connected.
The Internet needs more of Garretts wholesome antics.
This is the most minutes in a row I’ve smiled since last year.
He’s so funny 😂
They are like brothers
i wonder how garrett would feel if i showed up outside his house purely to vibe
17:20 (or 4:30pm) into a 40 minute video about a day in his life he says it’s time to start planning my day good lord if that isn’t the most relatable fucking thing
Watching this at 1.5x is insane
I THOUGHT EVERYONE HAD PSR😭😭
these are the exact vibes i want this video is immaculate
I like that he didn't apologise for not having posted for so long, as he shouldn't
This literally made me laugh genuinely for the first time in months!
I learned to skateboard
You give history teacher vibes
Congrats on the marriage. I'm so happy for you'll
During this Quarantine I've been drawing, to make myself feel better.
Animal Crossing has been my life all of quarantine :')
Garrett this wasn’t a day in your life video this was look at several things in my house and listen to me get distracted and tell side stories in a disorderly fashion tbh it’s cute and v relatable as an adhd person but then also as an adhd person oh my god I can’t watch it
I missed this
i need another andrew x garrett song
sitting in my towel for an hour using my phone is a staple of my personality and i have never felt more connected to someone than when garret said he does it to 💀😭
okay...I'm not even halfway through this video and I can tell you already that this is the best day in my life video I have ever seen. seriously the best! and I'm a hateful bitch so that should mean something 🤷🏼‍♀️😘
I started a buisness making crochet blankets, figures and clothes and its going pretty decently 😊
I love how he’s talking about how fucky time is and definitely sped up this video prob bc he was taking too long and couldn’t cut it down and this was still 40 minutes lmfao I love Garrett
the only two boys id trust with my life and ive never even met them
Well I started vlogging during this time coz I was loosing it because I live in a medical college campus and it's hard to see people dying or in pain outside the emergency. I wish whoever is reading this stays healthy and happy. 🤗
garret and andrew being dorky together gives me life and cures my depression 🥺🖤
.
I need that Harry Potter shirt in my life and on my being. 😍
GARRET AND ANDREW SAVING 2020
His voice gave me rumplestiltskin vibes from Shrek 4 in this vid 😂
Making rice crispy treats with old vanilla coco pops and left over marshmallows! Topped with a chocolate concoction and many many many sprinkles! I don’t know how it tastes yet, it’s setting on the kitchen counter right now! I’ll be trying them out with my little gremlin sibling in a bit! Sending love and honey smelling rose smells your way! Over and out.
The intro reminds me of my boyfriend and me when I get hyper and don’t make sense
I LOVE this, make more vids like this pls 💙🤗
OMG I'VE MISSED U GUYS!
If you don't already you should have a podcast
Ok so kinda weird but over quarantine, something that made me happy was just sitting in a dark room with my record player on full blast, and i mean that in the happiest way possible LMAO. Like, it sounds kinda depressing but it’s not i swear, its just relaxing and can almost put you in an out-of-body state. Anyway..
Omg funniest video ever!!! U guys together are just hilarious. The giggling is infectious! Please please make more videos x
Im watching this while sitting on a step stool. Hunched over in my stores stock room. While a spider eats a wasp in the corner.
Our Harry Potter king is back  okay ngl when Garrett pulled out Benjamin from the cabinet I screamed
No wonder so many people love you. You beautiful soul
We stand a non-toxic loudy king.
Something I have gotten into during quarantine is playing persona 4 golden one of my friends gifted it to me on steam and I finished it fairly recently. That same friend and I will play dnd together or watch a twitch stream over a video chat. When legend of Korra got on Netflix I was able to watch that
IM HERE FOR THE GHOST CONTENT YOU BETTER NOT BE PULLING MY CHAIN GARRETT, ily keep up the amazing work ❤😍
Sleep all dayy!!!!
Omg Garrett....you’ve made quarantine bearable!!!  More videos please... please....please....I’m begging you 🥰!!
Garret Watts has Micarah Tewers energy and vice versa.
I've been going on walks and going to free webinars part of my degree field, so learning new things
Garrett you're back hiyah
I’m entering my first year of university after a four year gap since high school and when COVID hit I was already nervous about trying to befriend new people but then it just didn’t stop and now I’m 10 days before going to university and this video helped calm me. Thank you so much for existing ilysm
why is nobody talking about how they spelled crochet in the subtitles
My answer: Besides losing my mind in quarantine, I usually face time my cousin. We’re only a year apart and really close. Or I’ll just snuggle and talk to my bunny and watch Harry Potter with him. Pretty cool if you ask me.
Garrett: "Were married"  Me: fucking.finally.
This video is like a representation of adhd and now I have a headache
wait why can garret actuality sing?!
Garret release a opera album
Thank you for posting in these dark times 🥺
Grapefruits are green in Auuugguussttttt... HAHAHAHA
please keep this content going!!! i could not stop smiling and laughing!!!
Answer to your question: Showering in the dark and singing on my bedroom floor
Wtf I have PSR, ever since I was a child I would sneeze when I got outside and it was really really bright. I've been that way since I was a baby ❤️
GHOST CONTENT!!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
i sneeze from the sun too!!!!
i love how chaotic every video he makes is
25:11 That's me when I get awkward about something!!! 😂😂  Seing another adult human doing sofa acrobatics just made me the happiest lol!!!😁💕
I've been painting rocks with my kids
WHY ARE U SLEEPING WITH SOCKS
what. i thought everyone sneezed when they look at the sun.
GARRETT!!! Man, I missed this dude, so darling.
I just got a Hufflepuff tattoo and I thought about how much you would love it!
We dont even have quaranteen here in Sweden duuuude.
GARRETT!! GARRETT!!! GARRETT!!!!!
Does Garrett have ADHD? because it can affect a lot of adults who try to be productive
WE NEED A “NIGHT IN MY LIFE” VIDEO FROM YOU
Did anybody else realize that that fight between Andrew and Garrett was 100% scripted or fake because they were trading the camera back and forth. They were filming each other. And during the breakdown neither of them had a phone or camera in their hands.   I appreciate the metaphor for going crazy but if you're going to call it a day in your life why is it so scripted.
Wanna know the moment I SmAsHeD the like? When you had your morning sneeze and that was a good one ☺️ it made me happy 😋
wow he has a gorgeous voice
Literally 3 seconds into watching this and I'm already laughing.
Welcome back bby 🥺♥️
This is what I call high quality content! Lol 💙
Getting tomatoplants! Also a new job but you know, prioritazions is in order (even though my tomatoes has now almost wilted)
Well...to answer your question Garett I have been organizing my room (VIDEO IDEA!! you should try and keep your house the cleanest it can be for a week) and I've been keeping in contact with my family in Califonia which is something I always wanted to do!
I will now be using the insult, you are the bandaid of my ass.  I worked all during the pandemic. I’m considered an essential worker at my place of employment.
I love everything garrett does in his videos. his upload made me feel really good
CROCHETING SHIRTS i like it tehe
I need a sweater that says "grapefruits are green in August" now
Me and Andrew have the Same birthday!!!! 😱😱😱
Hello! Last night after I watched this I had an idea, Garrett.  You and Andrew should rent an RV and travel.  Record and upload and spread some happiness during this crazy time.  That is all.  Bye!
This video is perfection!!! XD It's been a mental year. Totally forgot that JLO and Shakira half-time show was this bloody year omg!! Animal Crossing and a crap tonne of Youtube vids is what's gotten me through so far! :P
I just wake up and scream into the void until it's time to go back to sleep. Quarantine is neat!
I’m convinced Garrett has ADHD
Since quarantine started I have been playing with my rats, watching the latest season of Fruits Basket and playing dnd through discord.
*The Thanos glove in the background shows it all*
25:00  this energy that he radiates here is equivalent to that one TikTok “if you ever see me fightin in the forest with a grizzly bear, HELP THE BEAR, cuz that bitch gone need it”
Is no one going to talk about how great garrets singing is
It's the ADHD for me... 😂 I love it
Were have you bin
Night video
Garrett we’ve seen a night in your life. You wrote a rap about babies
Over quarantine I got a new cat named Toby 💖
Garrett that vibrato was BEAUTIFUL
I’m a 44 working suburban mom and wife and I look forward to your videos and then rewatch all your videos to appease my ADHD mind.
Garret! You’re alive!
CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE  SHIRTS OR JAKEST PLEASE IM BEGING YOUUUU
Why did I miss you..... XD
They were sold out before this video even posted I swear, I’m so sad 😞
This is great video, I loved it
I just want his freaking shirt !
More ghostie adventures please ❤️
I've been watching My Hero Academia and making new friends over Discord!!
in quarantine i haven’t done much apart from literally becoming nocturnal :) and also watching avatar the last airbender twice  ,, i have been trying to watch more animes but i’m really bad at finishing animes ,, i’m also trying to find a way to watch the new “given” movie :D
When I say this I mean it in the best way possible: Garrett has this ability to make every video feel like it’s hours long
Garret!! 🤗💗✨
Wait, does garrett have the voice of an angel??
Major Aquarius energy 😂
To feel better I've been self reflecting and visiting my gf
undiagnosed ADHD
Watching Garret feels like I’m watching an old friend’s videos and I can never stop laughing💖
I bought a hammock and a hammock stand and I put it up in my living room...
Thank you Garrett for teaching me why I sneeze when I look at the sun, I never understood why and you just gave me so many answers.
We ALL can learn from that squirrel 😂 also I missed you guys, I just love seeing Garrett and Andrew, something just pure and hilarious about em ❤
WHAT IS THE STAIN ON GARRETT’S SWORD
For Garrett's question//    Something that I've been doing in quarantine to make feel better is like  painting, photography, and just stuff like that. :) I have an Instagram for photography so if anyone wants it then reply to this comment
Over quarantine I've been teaching my pet rats tricks ❤ I'm so glad you're back! I love your videos and you're the most relatable person. Like. I imagine the inside of your brain is very similar to the inside of my brain
2020: It's reptilians lol. Blame the lizard skin aliens 😂
Yay! He's back!😊
I moved back home (quit travel nursing) bought two sphynx cats and started a new job as a Cath Lab Nurse.   But mostly I just play Pokemon go.. 😅
why does garrett remind me of shaggy from scooby doo
Yeah! PSR Squad where u at?! My husband makes fun of me all the time for it!
Please make more videos. 2020 needs your comedic ADHD stylings. I can’t help but smile through the whole video. Also, you could make a playground on the roof for the squirrels 🐿
All my life, I've literally never known what that symptom was called when you go outside and immediately sneeze because of the sun-- now I know what it is and that other people literally have it as well. Glad to know I'm part of the 18% and twinning with Garrett on this one.
Protect Garrett at all costs
Oh Garrett...how are you alive? xD
“Grapefruits are greeeeeeen in August!!” I can’t stop SINGING THIS DAMMIT LMAO 😂
LOVE THIS VIDEO.
3 isn’t that bad...but the text said 1220
protect him at all costs
THAT IS NOT MICROWAVE SAFE IT HAS METAL AROUND THE EDGE STAY SAFE DONT DIE
You came to Washington!?!? I live you you should've visited me🐸
Finally figured out who Garrett reminds me of. Alton Brown from Food Network!
Facetiming w my friends:) as a senior missing out seeing them walk across the stage sucked but clowning with them until 4 a.m. makes up for it.
"OH! did u hear a spider?" -Garrett Watts 2020
2020 has been a crazy roller coaster ride and I love pregnancy pillows
not to be rude but have you ever been diagnosed with adhd??? after i was medicated it made my life so much easier
I’ve been working and playing Xbox and my college just started so that’s something!
*garrett gang*
I've been playing so much Dungeons and Dragons virtually.  I get to live in a little fantasy world where the plague known as corona is non-existent.  Also I got so sad when you threw your knitted sweater I hope the seam didn't rip. D:
I’ve been doing makeup, hanging out with my aunt and uncle, watching YouTube, watching anime, exercising, and cooking/ baking more.
We need more Garrett in a time like this
WHY DO YOU HAVE FRUIT LOOPS IN THE FRIDGE IM CONCERNED
GARRETTT!!!!❤️❤️❤️
I started my YouTube channel that literally no one watches but it keeps me busy 😁
Are you kidding me?! I sleep with a sword too! Literally because I am terrified living alone! Ah!!
I missed Andrew! And Garrett ofc!
ive started playing the keyboard and writing loads of more music. Asked my mom to teach me some embroidery. Got gifted origami paper for my bday so i put that to use and just to feel better ive been excercising much more and learning the choreo to my fave BTS songs
Garrets smile combined with Andrews laugh is the only cure for Covid 19!!!!
i’m so sorry for being a inactive fan! but i forgot how much ur videos made me happy! love you!
That clip of garrett in the shower, was, kinda sexy
thanks for being one of the few you tubers in la that support Quarantine
During quarantine, I went home and spent time with my parents and then when and visited my friend...and yes we stayed at the house but it was fun.
"Grapefruits Are Green in August"  EP coming soon?!?!?  o.O
I need more of this content 💕💕💕
i dont think those plates r for eating
ILYYYY
“I don’t get distracted by things” 2 seconds later playing with a ghost figure😂
this whole video has been wholesome but 33:35 🥺🥺
When is grapefruits r green in august coming out on Spotify?? 🤷😂😂
Garrett don't microwave your fancy China plates! They probably have gold or a fancy metal edging that will spark in the microwave! Also, crochet that squirrel a sweater!
I actually met my boyfriend during the quarantine. As we live 3,5 hours apart, and he is in a risk group, we have had to find many ways to do things together without beeing with eachother IRL. I always isolate myself at least a week before each time I travel to him. We can't wait for this all to be over, and to spend even more time together. And yes I ordered the Yootooz. So a little tiny Garrett Watts is gonna live with me here in Norway :)
omg, you remind me of Doctor Daniel Jackson from Stargate!
I feel like I can’t give you a serious answer.. idk how to be serious with you lol but honestly, I’ve spent sooo much more time outside. It’s been really fun and just makes me feel younger and fresh? Go hiking and record it!! 🤞🏻🐜🐞🐿
Happy your back!
Andrew and Garret giggling together is THE BEST sound on popular white YouTube.
Garrett I missed your weird ass ❤️❤️
Since his upload schedule is 1 video every few months, does he have a day job now? Like if I go to Trader Joe’s will he stocking the pre made salads? How does he survive on when he’s not making videos? 🤔🤷🏻‍♀️
I’ve been:  Biking, hiking, and Skating on roller skates in a trail by my house daily (I had to learn how to skate during quarantine too)   Learning to cook/ bake new recipes   Reaching out to family and friends   Listening to new music   Journaling  Making daily schedules   Starting a daily skin routine and maintaining my hygiene whether I go out or not   Organizing and fixing things in my house
I have been watching Gilmore Girls!!!!
i've been obsessed with this friendship for years and i'm so glad youtube has not broken it
I have been checking in with myself and creating a day where I am constantly doing things that I enjoy. If I need to do something less enjoyable, I do something I love before and after it. Also lots of baking!! I learned how to bake cheesecake!
Reading!! Haruki Murakami helped me through
Damn i really need a pregnancy pillow to go with my sword now!
I have lost 8kg this quarintine
For the time in quarantine, I have started walking at least 5 miles a day.
At the exact same moment that Garrett said "I have a Tinder notification...this might be the one!", I got a Hinge notification. Coincidence? Yeah probably.
Not gonna lie Andrew is looking hella cute. Btw I love these videos we need a night in your life for sure
this isn’t a video this is a vibe
this isn’t a video this is a lifestyle
Yoga, meditation, journaling, and watching this video :-)
I’ve been embroidering & playing too much of Star Wars the fallen order 😂 also wishing you’d post more videos, they seriously make my day Garrett!
I've been researching future roles in the army (I want to join), as im extremely interested, it makes me feel better :)
For a while during quarantine I was playing a lot of Animal Crossing and rewatching the entire series of Phineas and Ferb
I LIVE IN WASHINGTON!!!! I just realized that my state is so amazing (every state is amazing) I never thought that this rainy place was so beautiful. Washington is the state of plants. I’m happy now.
every morning i wake up, look out the window to the sun and sneeze three times. if im feeling extra spicy ill use my phone torch above my face before i turn the lights on
Fucking excited for this
that frootloops box in the fridge had me screaming! XD
This is your time to put out more videos!!! 😁😁😁 Shine baby, shine!!!
Roof gang!
Quarantine hasn't changed Garrett in the slightest, some things never changed.
I loved this so freaking much!😊 I could listen to them laughing together all day!
Hi Garrett!!!!!!! I’m so happy to see you ❤️ I hope you’re doing well. Sending you love and positivity
You bring me pure joy. Please please please upload more, you amazing human!!
i don´t know what else to say. I really enjoyed this. Thank you for existing
Him mentioning J--Lo' and Shakira's Superbowl performance blew my fucking head. HOW IN THE HELL WAS THAT THIS YEAR HOLY SHIT
Nice to know Garrett is awake at the same hours I am..... living in Australia
Him: witch one do you think I'll have. Me: the cake Him:Ó╭╮Ò Me: its okay sometimes I eat cake for breakfast.
This made me actually giggle out loud. Thankyou
Living for his vlogging background!!
i have that reflex too lol   love your videos <3
please make a night in my life video!
Sleeping
Wait your up at  12. JeeeezzzzzzzzzZ. That's early for me. I don't usually start my day till 3. I haven't even gone to bed yet.
I had no clue there was a name for sneezing when you walk in the sun
I started teaching myself Korean this quarantine as it's something i've wanted to do for a while but couldn't afford classes, I also started watching a lot of BL dramas which somehow increased my self esteem and sense of worth and made me realize I shouldn't settle for less than what I deserve and I also got into digital art, as you can see i'm moving from thing to thing cuz I have the attention span of a baked potato
Eating chocolate cake for breakfast ah the joys of adulting
I love that you two are still friends
You and your room gives me a gay, chaotic Milo from disney’s Atlantis vibe and I love it
Does anyone know what kind of camera he uses
answer: ive been drawing and taking cold showers casue ig cold showers make your serotonin say hello and plus when ever im sad my brain says "hey we should go take a cold shower but make it close to a hour"
"a man never forget his first broom." XD
How do u survive off of like 4 videos a year? Do u have another job?
please do a night in my life we need it
we stan an unproblematic boi
I think Garrett is a wizard and that's why he's so eccentric

Oh my god I’m so glad something good has finally blessed my page
Awww your youtooz are sold out 😭
I grew a human through this quarantine period 😂👶 Which was the best reason to eat ALL of the food!!!
So like 2020 is pretty much summer vacation with a funky flu flying around. Because everyone knows that once summer vaca hits, WHO KNOWS when it's Thursday.
I laughed so hard at the ghost under his foot 😂
to fee better during quarantine i picked up my guitar after 6 years :)
I love this guy *😂
WAIT sneezing when you look at the sun isn't a normal thing everyone experiences?!?
Absolutely missed your energy and loved every second of this ❤❤ really needed it. Also, go tf off with that opera voice that actually sounded really good!!! Omg! I was not expecting that!!! Would love to see a night in my life video 😁
Yes please a night in your life!
I don't only sneeze from bright lights but also from chocolate. 😐 Hbu?
Garett thank you for taking time and a mental break and also making this video, anything and anytime you post is genuine and so exciting. No matter when or where if I see you post I take tome and watch 👍 thank you Garrett and Andrew
Reason #27382683613 to protect Garett at all times: makes tiny sweater for a squirrel 🥺
Loved this, we would love to see a night in my life video 👏😋❤️ we love you Garret and Andrew ❤️ you guys are just so fun and sweet 🙏❤️
I’m crazy about BL series these days and I know that their relationship is platonic but I can’t just help but ship them.
i love this man
Their Podcast would be the most interestingly ridiculous podcast on YouTube, and I would listen for sure . Especially if they had a segment called “ Weird News” on the internet .
thank you for being a ball of sunshine, Garrett. i’ve honestly been so shitty, and i see your notification pop up in my phone. i adore you and i love you❤️
Everyone becomes garret in quarantine😂
i got em too 7:40
Reading sometimes, and talking about anything and everything with my friends (literally anything) Ps: i❤️u
i am SO living for this energy, its so fun!! Garrett is genuinely one of the funniest people i've seen and im glad Andrew can capture that so well lol!  As for the question:  For my quarentine i get like wicked lonely, so I tried out vr chat!! ended up making friends, buying a VR headset and now i get  to hang with people, but virtually!!
Did he get back into his hoarder self again... Oops time for another intervention?
The two boys I’ve missed the most
🤣🤣. True tho
<3 loved  this video sorry i watched it late
Got dang sold out already
Garrett is precious. 😂😂❤️
Garrett is like a human teddy bear
~a night in my life~~~~
To answer the end question, I got a Ring Fit Adventure and it has helped me SO MUCH OMG
This video is all I needed in these dark times
When you get older that photo sneezing thing gets weaker. When I was a kid, even looking at a bare lightbulb would make me sneeze, but now that I'm old(er), I can barely get a sneeze out of staring directly at the sun, which you should never ever do. But anyway, my conclusion is that that gene must get weak or something as you get older...or it's just me and that doesn't happen to anyone else with this weird superpower.
I've been making earrings and painting!! lesbian things 😍
💚
hahashsjs I'm going to need a grapefruits music video
Do not microwave those plates! That may be metal painted on the rim, and it will create sparks!
iloveyou.
you are one of the 3 youtubers i can watch for more than 10 minutes without getting bored and i love it. i can’t watch people who talk slow or i lose interest and have to skip through 😌
make a night in your life! :D
I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing  to keep somewhat sane in quarantine
I do regular stuff like reading books and watching anime or series.  For Books try reading ADAM SILVERA's books...  Try watching MOB PSYCHO, such a great anime...
I'm impressed that Andrew did not fall inlove with Garrret by this time. I swear that garret is so so so weird that I want to hang out with him all day.
Is no one going to discuss Garrents grapefruit song? That was the most stunning piece of vocalization I've EVER heard.
He protecting his pregnancy pillow
During quarantine I’ve been painting! I’m not very good, but it’s fun! I’ve also been spending time with my nephew! We’ve missed you Garret!!
..wtf is no one going to address Garrett’s singing voice?!
Also the answer to your question, I’ve been cheering myself up with chaotic BTS videos and BTS Run episodes cos they are a bunch of 7 adorable messes and I love them
I fucking love you!!! I need you to take all your songs together and put them on a CD! Because I want 12 of them! 💙💙
HES ALIVEEEE
This video made me feel happiness!
i love the way you decorate
wait.. what? did ur voice changed???
ITS 3PM!! text message says midnight
We don’t deserve the blessed goodness that is Garrett Watts.
Wait why do the likes and comments look different
Garrett my king!
“My favorite wand” had me cackling
Garrett
My Fruit Loops now and forever more shall live in the fridge.
If someone ever asks me what is it like for me to live with ADHD... I’m going to show them this video... or any Garrett video if I’m honest 😹 I’ve never related to someone so much in my life
Whoever crocheted that baby yoda is amazing
