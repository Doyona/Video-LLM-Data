I hope you guys enjoy the video. I know there's a few things different from every previous Hardcore episode. But I worked really hard on this, and my editor Dezro also worked really hard on it, and I am extremely proud of the finished product. And as long as I upload videos that I'm proud of, and ones that I feel have had the proper time and research put in (and not been rushed!), then I am happy :)  Also all credits and info is in the description, might make a tutorial for this on my SB737+ channel with a world download and schematics if you guys want it :)
H
Now make a bedrock house
RC20 bgm 😂😂
Boooo loser cut the vid loser
I just downloaded your entiere world and found your factory, IT'S HUGE!
20:45 Why do I hear a Sniffer or smth in the background
Using water to remove the snow also converted the caution concrete powder
3:07 u ok bro
After 2 years: I have made a subscriber farm in minecraft
Anyone found real cricket 20 background music at the stating😅
this is so cool!
We can all agree SB737 is not a gamer he is an artist
Ok so you took bedrock while ElRichMC literally transmutated it into existence, very different.
He's the second person to get a bedrock block, isn't it?
Wow man your are so intelligent 🤓
He made a lava chicken shack
Ngl getting 2 bedrock per seconds is way too less for that much work, i'd just dupe the bedrock into billions
1:45 Wait till that Vegan Teacher sees this LMAO
Who is rewatching in 2025?
Sb737 I know that you was wocing some people and you said that sum op amere
I am your new subscriber. Please give a heart to my comment
999+ call form mojang
is it just me, or is it that sb737 has a farm for everything?
Bro is an AI🗯💥computer
I knew it
24:42

in what situation would u need this 😭
Bro made a lave chicken from a Minecraft movie before it even exists 😊❤😂☠️
YouTube do you play mincraft
Best factory ever
His eyes get more and more red throughout the vid. Great vid but get some sleep😂
27:26 Maybe the generic method after creating bedrock from word tearing and using a ton of cluster chunks
I don't know, I'm just listening, not understanding 😅
Bro like cookie God factory district
how to duplicate book of quill??
The decoration in the factory is like "Create mod? Nah we got create mod at home."
If there's a block I'd want to use in any creator smp to make a base with it'd have to be this one.... accept no compromises
Imagine making this farm on donut smp.....
Impressive! May I ask where the  name SB737 came from? Im new to the channel.
woh even youtube is saying this is good
Massive?
The voicecrack at 26:21 🚡🚡🚟🚟🚠🚠

ELRICHMC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

LAVA CHICKEN!!!!
Ayo why are you making a bedrock farm
lava chicken?
Cool video, but if you're using all these glitches to get the bedrock item, why not just dupe after getting a single block?
This is a 10 millenium old world
We found the most illegal player in the entire universe!
I subscribed already 😊

How did you get bedrock ☠️☠️
Next video:I built commandblock farm in Minecraft hardcore
Finisg this story with one word a stick
And he got every single illegal item
A YouTuber even was able to find out where the barrier is
You could get a barrier
50 missed calls from Mojang
bro deserves a lot more likes views and subs for this. insane dedication
Bro I thought he hack the server but is not
Noch
Guys the easiest way to get bedrock is...         Getting from creative
Build an airport in your Minecraft hardcore world
Cookie did the same is just cookie made a wool farm and you made a bedrock farm
That was really cool! What are you planning to do with the bedrock?💩
MAN is genius
Lu sudah gila
To remove the snow from the gravel and wool use water
yo the music was on point
Why do I even need bedrock?
SB737 makes a bedrock farm in his pc. Maybe his PC is made of bedrock, it never crashes
💀☠✋🥶😱😱😱😱
good job
at first when is saw bedrock rock i though its was a farm for bedrock edition and realized its wasnt
I made a bedrock farm that got me much more bedrock so much quicker but it is unfortunately been removed on one of the updates and I cannot downgrade my Minecraft cuz I play PS4
“But not too complicated for me” is the hardest flex
I know the music where he says: this will land me straight into the portal it’s from a few videos of Kolani’s videos 😊
31:50 Imagine placing the bedrock in the wrong spot
The fact that YouTube comments on every single video..!
can someone explain why the textures didnt revert back to 1.12, or is he using an extra texture pack
this guy is INSANEEE !!
Bros meme is crazy
Wow
Get command block
bro  is in creative 😈😈😈
What can't this man do?
nice vid
mmmm amethyst my favourite unobtainable block
There is an easier way to get bedrock  You can go to the one block at a time update then you can pick up bedrock then throw it at your head to wear it then go to the version your world is in and then take it of your head and you will have bedrock
The rich mc do this in 2022 he is the fist not you and youtube dont coment in his video
Why doesn't he just put some bedrock in a chest, save state the chunk, and then just pick up the bedrock and unload the chunk, resetting the chunk to when there was bedrock in the chest?  It would be a trillion times easier and faster than having to use the farm multiple times.
Cul
how was this made 1 year ago
AMAZING VID SB!!
Now get command blocks
🤚😊
F i me
Dd
Hm
Sb737 I'm a og I've been here since like 4 years ago but I couldn't find your vids for few months but I'm back I loved your stories with your rival and I remember since day 500 of your world I loved it and still do 🎉🎉😮😅
Obisdian Farm 💀
Bruh I’ve seen a diamond farm and thought it was crazy, but this? Dude how- 😭
What happens when you make a mistake?
Sb you are mad.
This was insane
Wait, if you're on 1.8, how do you have shulkers and the new totem texture?

But... what will you DO with the bedrock? lol
Minecraft Engineers are way more better than real ones 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Minecraft be watching this-
i have never seen anything like this before
Bro built a bedrock farm
this is just cracked out
is it in minecraft bedrock or java ?
✋🏾
I’m confused 🤯🤯🤯
Huh
Whats the backstory behind your name
The face am is a lil awkward honestly. But amazing job with your hardcore world
I. Will   like.
This factory looks a lot like a cookie gods builds
Redstone engineer should be a legitimate job holy cow
Imagine getting a signed poster and his handwriting has got to the point doctors handwriting is better
6:30 believer starts 😂❤
Can you put a tutorial pls I want this to be in my Hardcore world as well
osha would shut this place down. Parked forklifts have the tines down on the ground, man. Disgrace.
he is playing more in older version than the newests🥵😅
When i was a kid, i never knew the song at 5:44 said "Lights, camera, action". I always thought it was some gibberish.
Tip: SB in China 🇨🇳 sometimes means “Stupid” or “Crazy”
i just have one question, whats the point of having bedrock besides for show
SB... just make a factory in Bedrock Edition😭
Ggg
Bro, do you think the enderman are like: what the hell is that guy building over there?
😱😱😱😱😱😱
Ouch you sacked the diamond blocks instead of emerald blocks or you know ether even though I know you are a god at this game
I think I Just found a Minecraft genius
Not bad
who else is here on 10 august 2024 from the mace farm?
Bro has an infinite amount of motivation💀
Who's watching in August 2024
Now get command blocks😈
Going this way, SB will soon introduce a course in college named Gaming Science... 🤣
Bro comes up with the weirdest ideas
Now make the worlds safest base.
A computer go to the water bucket clutch with no eyes open😅😅😅😅
I may not know how to do taxes yet but at least I know what chunk population is 😂
if he downgraded to 1.12, then why is there new textures? like totem has a new texture
Cap
I'll like all your videos because you win a redstone challenge and a lot of you tuber need you to make there redstone tings goodjob❤❤❤
Everyone:you can’t obtain bedrock in survival.sb:forgetting something?
Minecraft should make an advancement for if u get bedrock in minecraft survival
Hey sb737 have you ever seen on of evidents videos?
Dude didn't even credit acookiegod for the thumbnail idea
You have the YouTube accent.
Mud block
YouTube shut up
You are crazy man
Hearing Cool Edge from Sonic Unleashed always makes me think of SB.
My brain exploded, but that was amazing
you did WHAT?
I think notch is sceard of SB737
next vedio: command block farm
Can’t u put more slime blocks here 26:05 so u get more bedrock?
Mumbo Jumbo v2
Funny how bedrock can be obtained in hardcore mode even though it cannot be broken. 😂
I really love your hardcore videos ❤️
No one will no how I got so many likes
0:11 nah
I genuinely thought this was another acookiegod video because of how many factories he makes..
Bro made a bedrock farm before a netherite💀
who didn't understand anything
ngl i havemt been on this chanel in a while and i mean a while but i dont know why i didnt think this man could do anything
Where is gaming it's completely engineering only the gaming is start the game and select the world😂
اريد افتهم انت الاجنبي ما عندك حياه شلون راح تجيب البريد
Now this is the storage part of the factory "But we just started and all the other rooms are named storage" correct
How do you feel that Youtube HIMSELF commented?
This comment has less likes then the pinned comment
Who ever is watching in 2024 raise hand
SB737 is literally the only guy who would make bedrock farm in hardcore minecraft!
I’m saying hello to myself for 2025😂
PFP:Ima penguin*proceeds to destroy the snowy floor*

cheat
I love how sb is always so positive
This is a jaw dropping video
OMG this is real?
I can barely make an iron farm whilst you are making a bedrock farm. How
Cooke god should watch this video 😂😂
Omg
😮
Hardcore mode is in bedrock now?
I don't want this series to end 😭
Who has realized that all the factorys are the same design except the sign/block/ingot on the top
Alot of verified youtubers are in this comment section huh?
Quick tip if you dig a hole 2 blocks down and make it a 2x2 then place 4 twisted vines. Then it removes the entity cramming cap. Good for breeding
SB737 you have come so far, from building every farm to reaching the world border to now getting bedrock and farming it in Hardcore!
A låååuuud
When your seed is zero, how do you recover/change it back?
When you picked up the book box i thought u were gonna get chunk banned
there's no way this was 9 months ago
Bro can now build wither farms everywhere he wants
I am mind blown away after this video 📹
I watch you since I have gotten my first fone😂😂🎉
when he made the bedrock factory i completely forgot that he was doing it only for the wither!!!!!!!!!!
Bro said it’s very easy that’s so much work bru
👾
Украл идею
Wait wut.
69k likes on this video when I clicked on it, NICE!!
When you realize that obtaining bedrock in MCPE is way easier 💀
Are you AI
That farm can actually get 148 if you just put a slime block above your head because bedrock generates there too
Dudeee....
Man, I've never seen a YouTuber put so much Sonic the hedgehog music on non-Sonic content 😂
I thought he would have used world tearing to make a command block and /give himself bedrock
Get the Structure and Command blocks next >:)
This guys videos give me so much nostalgia so seeing him in diamond and elytra was an amazing experience for me
Nice
Cookie did this to @ thecookiegod
Fun fact, if you mix glass with iron bars just right it looks nice
7:48 he just did that to flex haha
BRO HOW
What if i blow the tnt
You so pro
this guy is so smart, he really doesn't give himself enough credit.
Can you duplicate items using chunk save stating? Place the items you want to duplicate in the chunk, activate the save state, grab the items, and unload the chunk and the items should return.
YOU'RE A PSYCHOPATH 😱😱😱
mentira
The Fbi is coming
31:02 Outro 0:00 Intro
19:20 Building the Bedrock Farm
What about the blocks and items added after 1.12 they disappear?
Im watching this inside minecraft. If you are wondering how? Get the webdisplays mod. And there u go.
the TNT lag machine looks like the ISS at one point
Technically, you can break bedrock with a pickax with a diamond and enchanted pickax. It takes 27.4 hours.
🤚
16:16 what is this thing
bro are u copieng off acookiegod he made the farm stuff whole thing
SB737 i think Notch is scared of you
you are a pro
you are illegal
My life is a lie
Just go to the nether then go to the roof then grow a drip leaf-_- what a waste of time
If u missplace bedrock
A man said no one can obtain bedrock in survival and this man took it too seriously!
imagine if he activated the tnt 10:35
Shut up people
TNT=9000
Why can’t people get original ideas for factory designs
Bros turning into acookiegod.
Español ?
Who else thought this was acookiegod factory at first
this is copyright of @Carvs video
That’s crazy
I wish he would do more caves only world
When Beppo got bedrock it didn’t take this much effort
Insane

I mean this with no disrespect at all but have you touched grass recently? Again no disrespect whatsoever I know I can’t build that if I had years
Ur de goat            GOAT HORN FEEL
simple, go to one block at a time update, take a bedrock by a dispenser, transport it to the main world, and duplicate it. =)))
hello sb737 how much items you put in the droppers I make a tnt cannon and don found me :c
Minecraft please investige this guy😂
Go to the end then you go back to spawn

CraftymasterMan
Hi my new-self!
YouTube!
I’m a big fan of u guys!
CraftymasterMan!
why are you holding a 1.14 totem when you are playing in 1.12?
Now he is just outsmarting the game  Very impressive
Make a illegal house (By illegal I mean make a house made out of items like bedrock, barriers and other item that you shouldn't have in survival)
I Saw You Playing With PuffingFish
Times SB downgraded his hardcore world: 1.19 to 1.18 to get inverted portal ,1.17 to 1.14 to get ultimate armor then 1.20 to 1.12 get bedrock
liar! liar! liar! this is clickbait!
she break minecraft😱
sb: boing boing i'm a cow moooooo me: i am cr7 i am pro at futbol.
I didnt understand any of the minecraft mechanics but all i knew was this video was gonna be fun 😂❤
geo Sb bhai
Sb bhai bohat aala
ElRichMC estaria orgulloso de este man. Grande los dos de haber conseguido bedrock
y does sb remind me of mister maker
Why sb never said he's using litematica?
now get deny blocks
23:10 are we just going to ignore how even those minecarts were when he pushed them
Hey so u can dupe evry thing in this farm  Try dragon egg with this method
Chunk  savestating could multiply the chest if taken out and the unload the chunk and the chest would stay the same then there will be more
SB be like :I WONT DUPE SAND ITS ILLEGAL Also SB be like :TIME TO FARM BEDROCK 😂😂
Does anyone know the tutorial or YouTube video on the bedrock factory. I would love to build it in my world
youtube😯😯
My brain hurts
Maskgun gamers will know the song at the first
I have a new farm Ceative mode😂😂😂
I really love the sonic music in the background ❤❤
Well sb is now the most wanted minecraft criminal
am i the only one who noticed when he used the water to get ride of the snow it made some of the concrete power in to regular concrete?
U should collab with the other penguin (ishoya)
you made a farm for everything and your builds are fantastic btw
If you came from 2018 like here 👇
i saw cmd block and clicked off..
lyap
How the hell do people figure this out
Bro well done!
I bet you cant biuld a masion of every ore. And great job on your world it is amazing keep up the great work.
Can you do this with blocks like a spawner?
next farm hes gonna make is end portal blocks XD
The only person who is more illegal then you is kolanii
All i think about this video that SB cheated (There's a lot of videos about this) "Hardcore Youtubers Are CHEATING" or something like that Can you prove it SB737?
why are the textures new aren't they supposed to be the old ones
Imagine he misplaced a piece of
Hang on, since when there's totems in 1.12? I'm also pretty sure you can't use fireworks with elytras in 1.12
gg
Bruh bedrock farm 😮😮😮😮😮 greatest hardcore player
Me: i aint doing this i am installing a mod for crafting bedrock
This is just insane
2b2t finna eat this up
Говори по русскому я вообще не заходи в ютуби когда
Bro is just defying minecraft physics
do you ever touch grass
Pretty sure I used chunk save stating for duplication back in 1.12 Seems like a faster way to get Bedrock once you have 1.  Idk why people will do every glitch in the game short of duping lol
did any1 notice at 11:27 it sais 1.2 not 1.12
i just noticed that sb737 looks like mr.beast chandler
elrichmc obtaining bedrock in java:
like if he should make a bed rock portle
There is to much echo in that other room but i lovee your videos could enjoy them even more tho!! Thank you
this is what I called surpassing the limits
The video I show people when they ask if Minecraft if that childrens block game
SB737: Makes insanely amazing farm that's completely functional  Me: can't get auto kelp farm to work for 5 minutes without breaking
🔥
🖐🏼
Minecraft: YOU CANT BREAK BEDROCK LOL XD SB737: really?
your one of them
I  LOVE  YOU  SB737
I used to watch you when I was younger, and I decided to watch you again now because this video looks interesting. Crazy how much better your videos have gotten since last time I watched you
Still wondering how anyone found out you can get bedrock like this
the sonic unleashed music goes so hard
I will just say that someone from the community who speaks Spanish did it first called el rich
Impressive
NOW THERE'S 2 PEOPLE WHO GOT BEDROCK ON SURVIVAL, ELRICHMC AND SB737
can you make other illegal block farms? i love your content
Give this man an award
✋
I play on your hardcore world
Hey, greetings from Turkey, quality youtuber.
SB7737 is so smart🎉❤😊
31:12. But it is the End of the world.
...dude. place shulker and put bedrock in it. Save the chunk. Come back, take the bedrock stack,  spread out the books, and walk away. Go back and tah-dah 2 stacks of bedrock. Repeat until you're duping shulkers of it
🤯
Get a stack of every command block in the game
Try to get every command block in the game
🤚
Amazing
I thought you where talking about making bedrock edition farms on java or something like that.
Hacking the world ❌️ Hacking my brain ✅️
Mod please show items in shulker box
Mojang be watching this like👁👄👁
Praise lord LTN
For a hot the time yon create a mode😊
1 situp for every like
LOVE the use of sonic music!!
im so glad you gave a shoutout to the guys who discovered it, they dont get enough attention for their amazing tech usually!
Dude chill! The music in combination with your fast speech is so annoying after a few minutes.
Bro is actually super smart.
I random saw that video so i watched it all
No way 😃😃
How did you get bedrock if you can't live it or break it
Read only mode means that the chunks can not be overwritten thus why the spawn chunks look different
I would actually like you to send in your discord server the sped up replay of you just collecting bedrock. it's impressive idea and more but i do not believe you did it in survival and not just went to creative or change the texture of another block and just faked it...
I died inside when he accidentally turned the powder into concrete
BITTE MEHR CONTENT MIT PALUTEN UND MAUDADO
Sb737 videos be like: I built a farm that gives me creative mode!
Hey what happens if u put the slime block there where the gateway portalblock is please answer
Sb737 is the first one doing illegal Minecraft stuff in Minecraft hardcore💀💀👍👍👍
imagine if he accedentally placed one in somewhere he didnt want
I guess mojang should hire sb as an engineer now 🥶
Hindi translation please ❤❤❤
earthcomputer and xcom6000 the legends
27:14 “it’s really really easy” 💀💀💀
🤚🏾
bro almost just ended the hole series at the end, but pretty impressive
SB: has bedrock farm also SB: I dont have a sand duper
That was perfecttttttt😱
That was perfecttttttt
That was perfecttttttt
Hii
Imagine he places one of the bedrock in the middle of his house 😂
i been watching since day one it been a long time
✋🏾
Sand duper?
If you downgraded to 1.14 then you could’ve gotten all protections😅
that was cool
This video was insane
elrichmc
Can you F3-A instead of flying away and back?
Imagine misplacing the bedrock at the last part
Just, wow. I mean, wow.
Chetheur
Now i can close my friends in a bedrock chamber.
Bro you serious you need to work with nasa you totally have a massive working brain 😅
I’ll do 1 push-up every like and reply this comment gets!😂😢😢😮😮😊😅
27:17 Well ElRichMC technically fished bedrock (yeah, fished): "Survival 1.12 Ep155 - ElRichMC", minute 1:44:00 (t=6240)
If it is your own design then it is outstanding unit. Tell you made it your own or someone other made      it for you.
mai bran hurtin
This player is illegeal
i have a question, how did u like get the posters in ur world? was that a datapack? or did you make the mapart by hand?
Idiots that thought it was gonna be mass produce and automatic like me😂 👇
Bro Elrich mc but worst
Episode 500: today we built a sideways slab farm in minecraft I’m defidently not using mods!
✋🏿
Wow... I know that might sound sarcastic, but this is truly amazing.
Windows made out of scaffolding. Yup real warehouse feel
An absolute BANGER of an video and amazing explanation of bedrock farming
ah sb737, breaking the game in new and exciting ways every day.
I just got THE ugliest haircut at "great" clips.
Now get a life lol
how many times you said chunk or chunks?
if you where in a server you will be banned peremenantly till now and only thing to be done to unban you is to somehow delete that shullker having books
He could make the farm faster by placing his stack of bedrock in a chest in the savestated chunk
Is it possible to modify this farm so you can get the end gateway portal instead of bedrock?
WHAT YOU DID CAN LET YOU DUPE MITEMS
31:18 “ it’s not the end of the world” *it’s literally called the end*
I managed to get protection five on my armour
I Like How You Use The Sonic Mania Soundtrack Im A Sonic Fan And Minecraft Ty
Even Youtube itself is flabbergasted 💀💀
Make an end portal block farm💀
This man has got PHD in Minecraft 😂
Thsi is teh most impressive and craziest video yet😮😮
Wow an amazing video!!!
I’m SUUUUUPPPPPPPEEEEERRRRRR tired from my first couple days of school and watching vids like these just make me calm so keep up the work man super impressive.
I think u dropped your crown
Make a cookies farm
SB the god of making his hardcore world hardcore in content and pushing the game beyond its limits....but.....why doesn't he build actual builds? I haven't seen all of his videos but I have seen most of them and the only thing that really comes to mind is when he made a UFO thingy in the End, emerald palace, his storage room, and some small pixel art. SB make your world pretty!
"day 7001" bro started his world before I was born 💀
✋
How mad would you have been if you died from fall damage at the last couple of seconds on the video
😮😮
Why do you need the autosave to happen? It saves when you unload the chunk?
I know that day 10,000. You can complete it
I have been I fan and watched every video from your awesome world to hardcore and this is crazy for you on another level
Pengen ikutan tapi gak punya laptop apa pc😢😂
Best fame of minecraft ❤❤
How is this possible
Чем это отличается от простого Дюпа?
Op video bro love from india
nice
Blud is a minecraft scientist
If you are downgrading your world, you could also just install a mod at that point, because it is effectively cheating.
Now make  a bedrock prison pls
you could have just downgraded your game to an old version and got bedrock
Elrichmc ya lo hizo primero😎
Why did Minecraft use the 1.14 textures even though you were in 1.12? Why'd you go through the trouble of getting the 1.14 default pack into 1.12?
You should have save stated an elytra and grabbed one out of a chest every 45 seconds.
9:26 HONEY 🍯
Ok, that was interesting. But once downgrading is involved, I cannot accept it. It is just too cheaty.
Now you can keep a Wither as a pet.
even youtube is getting entertained by your videos
how the heck do you do this stuff
What chicken farm design did you use?
3:00 why would you waste sand and gunpowder to make TNT just to use to get more sand when you can just instantly mine the sand with a shovel...?
😂🎉
While this is impressive, you only need to do it one time.  Literally once you get 1 bedrock, you could do the dupe bug with save stating which duplicates the contents of a chest essentially. So you have the chest with the contents in a chunk, unload and reload the chunk without it save stated so it saves it, then save state it, remove the contents unload and reload and it duped essentially. wash repeat. You dont have to keep breaking bedrock after that one was dropped.
Elrichmc vibes
Get command block
Now build a bedrock farm in bedrock version
20/10😊
El rich ya hizo eso de primero
A what
So messing with the save files is ok by this challenge
This dude doesnt look British at all hahah
Now get borders
farming bedrock in hardcore minecraft because at this point, why the heck not :)  i mean, SB got to a state where, unless he really goes putler levels of idiocity, he can not die and is free to do whatever he wants. maybe he can go back to the mystic times, when one was able to craft noptch-apples...
WoW
30:16 Couldn't you have used Chunk-Savestating to dupe the Bedrock after the first 8 or so pieces?
No farm is impossible for SB737 he's a goat in Minecraft farms
I had been so addicted to ur videos till 2000 days after that i quit minecraft due to not having a good pc but I'm actually happy to see you get this long i get to see this video accidentally after seeing this i really wish i could play it again 😊
Bro created the matrix on god 😅
This is actually impressive because my brain would just break down and crash
How do people come up with this?? 😂 Very, impressing stuff! So much determination behinde it.
bro went back in time to mine bedrock and go back again to his timeline to make a bedrock waterfall
no words!
Get command blocks
This whole series is just about abusing bugs and unintended game mechanics but everyone in the comments is acting like this is some top tier content. I am disappointed
The amount of Minecraft knowledge i gained from this one video is 💀💀
Mojang is scared of sb 😂
Seriously who comes up wich such a machine
Ur a pro builder or domething??
Hello sb, I was a huge minecraft player and i was always watching ur videos and know I stop minecraft but watching ur video is always so cool!!
I just figured out a way to duplicate diamonds by using that
I like my own comment😂😂
One mistake is all it takes to ruin it
Everytime I see SB upload I think no we he one-up'd himself but everytime I leave the video suprised! Absolutly amazing work SB loving the content! :)
I haven't played Minecraft in years but your videos are very watchable. Excellent editing + narration and the topics are ones I haven't really heard of before
How do people think of these
this is so impressive!!!!!!
Amazing content!!
you can place vines or ladders next to the chicken to remove entity cramming
thx bro i used this to create my house in mc  i love it so much that my heart isnt letting me get out of the  house hahahahah
What an amazing video SB keep it up!!!
went to the toilet, came back, he's on 7k days and he's torn up the fabric of minecraft reality
😄I love your video SB737
Crazy what you do in vanilla.   I would never play like this personally. I also like building factories like that, but ofc when I do them in modded they actually produce stuff
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGEND HAS GOTTEN THIS FAR ON A MINECRAFT WORLD!
"Just taking a break from collecting every armour trim combination to make a bedrock farm real quick" What a legend.
Hello yt
SB you are my favorite youtuber and please upload a lot on minecraft server
Rip for Kevin the chicken 🙏
bro, just incredible!! 🤯🤯pls keep going, i think you are the best Minecraft youtuber in the world!
I like how sb737 has youtube literally complmeonting him every vid your the best you do stuff without complaining❤
New SB737 video be like: “I Got Every Death Message in Hardcore Minecraft!”
I really like the new format
-AJ HOW A BEDROCK BECON oh, and also for those get why  his netherright pickax got downgraded to a diamond pickax it is because in version 1.12 netherright did,t Exist but don’t worry when he changes it back to 1.20. It will go back.
next video: i found a way to be in creative in hardcore minecraft
Imagine if at the end when his elytra broke he would die and didn't have a totem.
I'm from India and I really love your content
A bedrock farm what else will this man come up with
Definitely easy to use, extremely minf f***ink to build though hahaha
Amazing video! Something I would like to see is that you don’t commentate the whole time, and maybe not facecam the whole video. But do what you want, the vids are good anyway.
...good to see you again
youtube himself commented
you are so pro
At the end when he fell I was like)well 7121 days down the drain but no.. sb never dies!
I love how YouTube themselves commented on SB737's vid. Truly awesome. Keep up the good work my favorite YouTuber:)
How about command blocks
sb in 10 years: I SURVIVED 69 MILLION DAYS IN MINECRAFT HARDCORE
I love that I understood what SB said and not at the same time keep it up SB
It looks like a giant spaceship.
I remember someone saying that SB  will get bedrock 😂
Seven thousand days what❤
Hi SB I really want Minecraft but my parents won't let me get it 😭😭😭 I wish I was as cool as you Man
I the hell did you do this
There are almost 7 comments that are verified..
I like how you didn't do the 100 days format and just did  a regular video but still put the day counter in for people who want it. You put so much time and effort into these videos and it really shows keep up the good work my friend
Sb737, this is heartfelt message. The fact you could get this far in your world is incredible. Ive been a fan since 2017 and you're videos keep getting better. I wish you luck on hundreds of episodes more to come! I was here 3 hours ago!
I never thought about setting region files to read only to avoid downgrade/upgrade corruption. That's clever, despite the solution's simplicity.
What is that music you used at the beginning during the short montage?
create a bedrock beacon!
10 years later: I built a COMMAND BLOCK FARM in Minecraft Hardcore
I love how much fun he has doing this thank you for making great content
its nice to see sb737 enjoy building
YO YOUTUBE RESPONDED TO THIS??!!, na then u know uve brought out a a good video
hey sb737 try getting portal blocks in hardcore minecraft
I'm so mindblown by how you made the explanation sound so easy. You're so talented. 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
He did the impossible
We need to all appreciate  how much effort sb puts in his epic content. Keep going man your the goat
Pls❤ 10,000 days
hi
You should be hired by mogan
Next video make a city
Sb I want to know what happened to minigod 951 from your old series of series to slay the dragon,wither,guardian, and shulker. Sb love your vids  and  have been a long time viewer.

I used to watch you like 5 years ago! But then I forgot about you! Then, I saw you commented on a Mr.Beast video and I checked your channel! Ur videos are awesome! And nise beard by the way 😊
ME SB737 nutt
You got Jinx about the mob vote armadillo one ha ha
Mr. SB737! I know this isn't related to the bedrock fam, but I have an idea for you on friend or foe! Clown's base has a little pond near it, surrounded by sand, and a skulk sensor trap would be really good near there, wouldn't you agree? It would be totally natural, so he wouldn't suspect a thing, unless he caught you prowling around there. Fellow commenters, back me up!
Eso te en inglés
Bro !! Something new ?? I am waiting ❤❤
D
Bring back awesome world!
RETURN TO YOUR AWESOME WORLD ALL THE OGS ARE WAITING BLOW UP THIS COMMENT BY LIKING SO THAT HE SEES THIS
I bought your friend or foe poster this video is a banger Keep up the good work SB
This feels like a sb737 red stone class
And great job!!!
Hey SB keep up the good work bro I love your videos
Bedrock edition had a proper bedrock farm, u could literally build it in like 30 mins and get 100s super easy lmao. Its patched now tho :(
I going to vote for penguins for you sb
ElRichMC.
I am so sorry the penguin lost I voted penguin
Can you get barriers they are way harder than bedrock, but I don't think barriers exist on survival. Also I voted for the 🐧
😮j
Which is the video where you reveal you didn’t burn a lot of diamonds
😮 cool
Using the save stated chunks or what ever u call it, couldn't you just duplicate a bunch or stuff by putting it in a chest and saving the cunk and then grabbing them and theoretically duplicates of the items would be saved in the chunk once you reloaded it?
best hardcore vid in a while good job SB!
How  0:13
The penguin with a plan
What ever happened to the xbox world?? Do you still have it? Do you still play on it
Im sorry but if somethig  requires you to revert to an older game version then you are cheating, might as well just open up creative mode at that point
And the armadillo won
The penguin got the least votes
Saddest person after mob vote winner... 😂😂sorry SB penguin wasn't added
Worst mob vote
Armadillo won the mob vote 😢
RIP PENGUIN ✌️😭

Sb I’m voting penguin for you
SB ur videos are very cool and this might be one of the best of them.i loved the Minecraft hide and seek and I am definitely gonna pick the penguin in the mob vote
Wait that's Illegal
I learned a lot of stuff in chunks  Thanks for making this video explaining everything you do unlike some youtubers
Now get cmd blocks with data corruption
SB you have done a sensational job in the hardcore industry of Minecraft. I don't care if the view count is not what it used to be or if Minecraft hardcore is tipping down, you continue being the best you can be. I would really like to see you try an obtain every unobtained item in Minecraft and create a museum of forbidden items. That would be awesome.  Additionally, since Halloween is coming up it would be cool if you could name tag and collect the pumpkin special head mods as collection :) OVERALL, you have come so far and are  considered a legend in the hardcore scene. Congratulations LEGEND. :)
we need the Penguin to vote for the Penguin (mob vote)
I was here cens day 1 and i stop waching sb737 cuz i had school and now its 7000 days😢
you have to be the most dedicated youtuber of all time, i can't believe you are still going man, you are really showing the infinite potential of minecraft on a whole other level!
I really like this new style where your also explaining all the little details like with the 1.12 downgrade, which is so sick for people who are interested in this stuff.
people on bedrock edition:
Hi sb will your invite me  ❤❤❤
Everyone here must vote for the penguin.
how did you do all of that??? THAT'S SO CREATIVE!!!!

Omg I just found this channel again after 5 years I’m so happy, it’s nice to see you come so far!
yo sb i think you should do 100 days in minecraft pocket edition and i bet you should fight the wither in those 100 days cuz the bedrock wither is way harder then the java one as someone who as been playing minecraft pocket edition for over 2 years even when i tried to beat all bosses for training the wither even with full netherite enchanted armour i couldn't do it so i challenge you to do it on mobile also i diffrent yputuber called Luke TheNotable did the challenge and he didnt manage to beat the bedrock wither i wanna see you try it
Really really easy , ok SB😅 you legend
*wow day 7000 how many years have been like i was in your 100 dqy episode keep going sb!*

This blew my mind 🤯🤯
How math be like
@SB737 could you use this method to get an OP advancement farm. The advancement gives you XP.
I love your video men❤
this was actually such a cool video, i really loved the edits
@savetheeditor
If you came from the Minecraft wiki raise your hand ✋
Real life  engineers can't compete with a red stone expert 💀💀
✋🏻
You’re the best YouTuber, I’ve ever watched
This was surprisingly one of the best explanations of bedrock farming I've ever seen! Usually ppl outside tmc get one or two things very wrong but you nailed every detail. W research
i love your vids  i am a fan ling ayo anda now not
The amount of effort that this man puts into his work is insane
Bedrock omg 😱
wow
what the heeeeell
I was wondering how many times does SB sneezes in a 100day video, can we get a really long montage abut it?
Im blind or the daycounter is actually smaller?
this video should have taken months to make
Hey SB I was wondering why you don’t use shaders cause I really recommend trying them they are beautiful and amazing😮😁😉
@sb737 ft cookie god  ✊📌
lol i love how there is a switch between the rooms where sb is filming. love ur videos always have keep up the good work sb
He is using creative mode in 7000 day series
I liked my own comment.

Can you make the next video about you making  a palace for the sniffers like you did for the camels
Apakah cuma gw orang indo ?
The amount of minecraft knowledge you have!!!🤯
Imagine he misplaced it at the end
Hello
Why did you build an entire factory if it wasn't part of the farm?
Minecraft engineering at its finest👌🍷
can you also get the portal block?
i wanna see SB737 playing modded ☠
jir gila bet riston nya co
I hope i do get some brain cells after watching ur vids
Bro ur a god in Minecraft 😱😱
Even I’m creative I couldn’t come close to doing the stuff he has done
everyone dont fall for any bait commentors like @KingJojoB
MAKE A  SUN OR A MOON
What happened to your awesome world series, there hasn't been anything new in over a year
This guy did not design this building
Are you playing 1.20 SB737?
Hi there sb737 I just started my hardcore world I am on day 2
Love the Sonic music! 😁 ❤️
شادي سرور؟
The factory 🏭  is stolen from Cookie God 🍪  Cookie armie for the win🎉🍪🍪
“Oops I misplaced it”
Him: you will understand later, you will understand when machine will work, you will understand when you see it done... Me: *doesn't understand anything but thinks it's cool as fu***
Awesome strategys man
Bro SB awesome video.And keep playing and building and iam with you.
but, why?
Name one thing this man has not done
why you couldn't dupe the bedrock
This is basically one of the most game-breaking farms ever! Hope your hardcore world doesn't crash to hard.
If you think this is impresive, chech ElRichMC rare items farm, he is a spanish crazy man who have every single item in the game, include barrier block, command block, tons of bedrock, and a lot more
The man who tells impossible is just a word
you can see his dark circles from 0 to 10 slowly progressively through the video
SB WHY DO U NEVER READ MY COMMENTS! I ALWAYS TELL U TO NOT MINE SAND FOR GLASS, BUY IT FROM VILLAGERS! I TELL U DONT MINE GLOWSTONE FOR REDSTONE LAMPS, I TELL U TO BUY IT FROM VILLAGERS! PLS LISTEN TO ME (Buy Glass From Librarian And Glowstone From Clerics) Btw Sry Caps Didnt Notice
SB, you should have got 5 more pieces of bedrock to get 7 stacks and 37, 737!
What is the farm you used to get feathers?
This is way more harder than science
sb in 2069: oh i want a crafting table, lets build a ultra giga crafting table farm.
i have been watching your content for over 3-4 years with my sister. I randomly remembered you and am proud for you
WHY NO FRF FOR 1 MONTH 😢
Here since when this world started 😀
Hey SB737 im a big fan of you and i was thinking if you want to do a 100 days on my modded minecraft server when its ready im buying it the 1 or 2 and gonna make it ready but if you want plz contac me
What's the music at 5:43
Bro never misses
This man is crazy
No one is talking about how sb likes Pokémon
at this point doing things like this is just normal for a hardcore series
Me when the
Is it possible to use this kind of glitch with reinforced deepslate in the ancient city?
Did you know that if you use walls   you can make the redstone current instant I believe. Love the vid ❤
Anyone else think the factory kind of looks like a school?  Also the editing in this video was awesome!
i did make a comment on a reaction video about getting bedrock... but i think he didnt get the idea from me but cool video
Were Are touren netethrite
My fav video ever on YouTube well done man! Big fan and looking forward to more game breaking and cool mechanic vids!😊
I don't know what I expected from 7100 days, but it wasn't a bedrock farm. INSANE job SB!
Bro what happened to your let’s play I was searching for your videos and when I found out at this time it has been 2 years I loved your old videos and I hope someone would answer why you stop posting.
Bro's literally albert einstein👽👽
Nice video man!
Broooooo wtfffff bedrock hardcore
Meanwhile notch is crying in the corner
this reminds me of the legend of Korra factory in season 1
You should do the leather armor trims.
why wouldnt u use a chest dupe, u can infinetly dupe everything u want to
YES SB! This is the best video you've made in this year! (not to say your other videos are bad or anything). The new content style is absolutely brilliant!
Sb casually speaking  minecraft language
All of this just for you to farm a un farmable block? Just get a chest of farm the normal way
At first i thought clickbait. Then I saw SB in the thumbnail. He dont clickbait.
Can can you make schematic of the factory? Pleaseeee
this video should make u notch really
Brooo you are betterthen Philza... sorry Philza faans hii is good to butt you know...
Sb is the GOAT 🐐
Build a Naruto and Sasuke fighting with each other statue it's a dare
Loads Of Loads Farm
love the video but whats the use of bedrock?
POV you live in a cherry base and have to downgrade 1 level
He did the impossible dream of every Minecraft players dream. Obtaining bedrock in survival Minecraft. I might shed a tear
child labor when
Wtf would you ever need bedrock for? A wither cage?
So brave for decorating with TNT 😂 It be my luck that a creeper would wonder in and blow it all up. 10:18
Hi
can you do that but u get a gateway portal? or is that impossible
I'm just happy that this looks great. Keep up the amazing work.
Hey I remember watching your amazing world series with my little brother and really enjoying it. Im so glad to see how far you have came on YouTube. Do you think you could make a video or 2 going back to it?
this is insane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now Get 3 Types Of Command Block, Barrier, End Portal, Reinforced Deepslate
HEY SB737CAN I PVP YOU PLS WITH AN IRON AXE LIKE U DID WITH QUIFF
I watch his first 100 days and loved it but it’s just not the same anymore he just has so much and the world is so old now I think he should start a new world
The knowledge of Minecraft SB has is far more then the own Minecraft creator has 😂🙌❤️
bro built a dirt farm before a chicken farm
you could load the world in 15.1-1.16.5, build a portal, throw 1 shulker box behind it, and in the 8 blick waterslide let the dolphein pick up the shulker while teleporting to nether duplicateing the shulker (it works on single item)
At 10000 days we should have a world tour live stream on yt.
For 19:00 it’s fine I have like 200 IQ
he stole a cookiegod factory design
מגניב
Amazing!
Ok mumbo jumbo😊
bro you deserve more than 40 million subs but one day inshallah
@sb737 SB YOU GOT  YOUTUBEF OF THE MONTH ON SONIC SUPERSTARS!!!
worth the wait :)
this man has played 2333.33333 hours just on minecraft
💖
ɴᴏ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ꜰʀɪᴇɴᴅ ᴏʀ ʜᴏᴇꜱ?
i will never have the brains to do anything sb does haha
I have no idea what he's saying lol
yes
Now speedrun building a house, cause if you misplace it’s fricked up😂
1002
Love ur content man! I've been a fan of u since I was like 7 - 9ish ( around when u started ur 7k hardcore world which was like 2 years ago  ) I used to watch it before school :D
Get the fire or light blocks
ই কাহানিবা command block ৰ fram বনাব
You will probably die to ClownPierce in Friend or Foe
Command block farm?
Commandblock please
Phase 1 build is similar to another one Youtuber idea
Can you make an pizza in Minecraft  tall me
Did someone notice that he has modern totem texture ?
Hey SB what is your favourite farm and glitch
is save stating also a form of block duping?
He's so smart
at 16:28 there is a nametag behind him
You won’t be able to get A COMMAND BLOCK NOW😈
I like the music you use. Much cooler than every other HC series I've seen.
ITS BEEN SO LONG SINCE IVE BEEN WATCHING THIS DUDE
Would it not be faster to dupe the first piece of bedrock you get by using the save state thing you mentioned?
1:00 i think my chicken farm is better
Even the factory design
oh my goodness
I’m from 🇺🇦
please let me know when you make 1
I will never forget I started watching you 6 years ago on YT kids on my iPad and her i am I am your oldest fan plus I loved the Friend or Foe series’s
Now build a java farm please
Very good at building
What if you put a slime block for the top piece of bedrock
i love how he made the farm a factory like aCookieGod usually does
Mojang with FBI will be coming to your door one day
you can realy good build 👍
SB737 is the type of a guy who puts the most effort into his videos, while also, at 27:15, calling an extremely advanced, risky to make, complex device "it's really really easy"
doesn't the game save when you pause?
Personally, I've found chicken farms more reliable of the babies are standing on daylight detectors instead of bottom slabs. Lower risk of drips burning, and you can just leave the lava in place without needing to dispense or pick it up. The detector will mess with redstone if it's not in darkness though, so make sure to use tinted glass instead of normal glass!
SB created a duper I guess
You know your running out of ideas when you out of a sudden just think LETS GET BEDROCK IN SURVIVAL🥳
Its 3 am and wtf am i abt to watch. Dear lord and saviour help me☠☠
Aliasal
Bro spent 4 irl day straight on Minecraft
You've made some decent improvements of the SciCraft design. However, they still get you on style points given they did it with a wooden pickaxe. Well done all the same.  That said, you don't really need to go through the trouble of making a self resetting farm, given that you could just dupe with Chunk loading.
Why do you like the snow?
You should shoutout to the people who find these things, instead off just putting them in the discription. They deserve more then that <3
RIP Kevin the chicken
Hope you never die you are amazing can you heart comment that will make my day
"the Redstone is pretty simple"
just a really well explained banger SB!!!!!!
What will you do in bedrock
istarted watching you from the first 100 days i love these hardcore series  keep up the good work
✋🏻
I think the best way to get bedrock in Minecraft survival is to change your world in bedrock and make a bedrock farm  I swear it is really very easy and also hats off to your hardwork
Been here since the first day
Whenever he downgrades his world, you know the video is going to be good
Next build a java farm
I've been watching you since around this time last year, and even in that short period of time, I've seen such a major growth in your content, and you've brought back that minecraft spark for me.  Keep it up man!
ur a monster. you know that?
I love this guys accent and some of the words to me are just so so funny btw after I watched him for a while I start talking like him I wish I could think like him cuz then I might be good at Minecraft
Devs: Let's make bedrock unobtainable in Survival. There's no need for it because it's usele... SB: Hold my mouse. Devs: ...  I don't think Mojang has even thought this was even possible. SB is pushing boundaries.
❤
if you're gonna use the chunk save exploit then i think you should've just duped bedrock with the method like 1->2->4->8->16... would be much faster than getting 1 by 1
that’s crazy
This feels illegal
You almost died in 19:19 because if your elytra durability is so low if u if it breaks then that's it u fell in that place and lost😢😬
How many times had he said chunk
32 minutes?! SB you’ve outdone us!
the unsaved chunks is a dupe glitch
awsome work SB😃♥
✋
Amazing video Sb737. It is so impressive! Also, when will you fix your end base, and mob collection. I have heard and seen that some mean wither decided to have a bad mood and destroy the warden cage. 😅😅😅 Anywho, love the vid; keep up the good work plz.
My man spent his whole life playing a block game XD
Amiok
Sb is a professional builder and has such knowledge in minecraft system 😮
22:38 dupliacation glitch
Bro, get better mic
If you had done it 3 months before I would lose my world my all builds 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Are mojang ok with this?
insane
Sb's next big project should be a nether star farm
bro is insane
this brother has spent 19.5 minecraft years on this world
Watching a sb video after months feel different
you could've abused chunk savestating to dupe the bedrock and therefore get more than 7 stacks of bedrock, realistically you could have got like as many shulkers as you wanted
old anarchy players remember the book and quills😂
Get an nethetrite beacon
Oh lord. Imagine building bedrock around people’s beds or people who are afk.  That’s unlucky 😂
cap!!!!!!!
2023: I Built a BEDROCK FARM in Minecraft Hardcore 2030: I Built a COMMAND BLOCK FARM in Minecraft Hardcore 2050: I Use CREATIVE MODE in Minecraft Hardcore
I love the new style of editing
Why does this guy look like the guy from fifty shades of grey . 😮 Question mark...
🤚🏾
Me: This is *Extremely* impressive... SB373: Does it in hardcore not even creative
why do i feel like ur gonna quit the 7000 days hardcore mode when is 10000 days
Instead of timing how many diamonds he can get, SB is timing how many bedrock blocks he can get?!
I know this farm is cool and all but in theory couldn’t you just get one bedrock and then use save states to duplicate it exponentially?
Click the name you see above my comment and help me reach 100,000
Can't believe there are farms for bedrock, Minecraft has evolved for sure
Bro has 500iq
Love the vid but A Cookie God?😅
If you're using chunk savestates to farm the bedrock manually, once you have some, why not just save yourself the effort and dupe it?

Why doesn't SB make the walls hollow? it would make it a lot less time consuming and easier.
Lore of I Built a BEDROCK FARM in Minecraft Hardcore momentum 100
just your regular sb737 video
Also congrats on 4 mil
You're such a mad lad sb737
you should get a pet
Fun fact: if you say fun fact everyone will listen.        No really, did you know that with mending you don’t gather as much xp?
bro cooked
Whatever happened to friend or foe
I feel like I'm sitting in on an academic conference whenever I watch one of these complex Miencraft downgrade + glitch build videos, fantastic job! I still don't think I fully understand how this farm works, but it feels like my brain has grown new folds anyways ahah.
you have so much items
You never disappoint!!
did he make flush factory?
This is just. Insane idk what to say bro,
Yo anyone notice how good SB is with elitra?😳
Didn’t the trims get deleted? And all your netherite and netherite blocks?
I really like the new direction this channel is going on
Bro you must have like 200 iq if you thought of it
Sb bro I’ve been a fan since 2017 I’ve watched every vid u are a goat this vid is amazing keep it up u goat
At 2:05 he used his elytra but he was facing the other way how?
Me who thinks surviving minecraft hardcore is impressive... well now hes farmin bedrock
I think he got the design from cookie
Mojang should add disarmed tnt for trolling and for decoration
12:33 I can't tell if he intentionally used the 1.12 redstone texture or not... ._.
Bedrock portal?
I love how he still uses sonic songs it just takes him back to his roots
Bro puts more effort to his hardcore world than me in school💀
This is AWESOME, SB!!!!!  I loved it so much!  Definitely worth the wait. :)  Thank you for the hard work you put into these!
Bedtrap your bed using bedrock
If in old versions someone destroyed your base you can do the save state thing ti get it back also can’t you dupe with it
my brain when he's explaining *HUH* my brain when it's finished *YEEEEEE*
You are actually insane! When scicraft obtained bedrock I was like, "wow, too bad this is basically impossible in single player" but you have done it again.
Sad to find out he uses that mod that gives him plans. He doesn't actually design anything just builds them
SB737 did a lot of illegal stuff.
Make a Netherite  factory!
Bro teaching maths science computer coding physics altogether
Me: ugh I can't make a piston door sb737:right let's start making the bedrock farm
big brain SB !
Sb do you have a discord server
Well done for 7000 days!
Does that also work for the actual gateway?
Has anyone ever done this in hardcore other than sb?
No way
Sb, next time you downgrade a world, try making the advancements file “read only” like you did with the spawn regions and then click off those files when you go back to 1.20 so you won’t lose all your advancements when you do that. Anyways, amazing video Sb and looking forward to more later
I predicted this video u can see my comment on your 1500 to 2000 days video I said that he's going to make bedrock farm in 6000 to 10000 days video😂💀
good vid
isnt this desing from the scicraft server?
✋️
そして次は岩盤を手に入れます
Bro took the 100 days challange too  far💀
良い動画を投稿し続けてください
w
They fr need to invite this guy into hermitcraft
His unstoppable
Was this supposed to be a hardcore series
i like how sb is 7000 days in and now only finally makes a chicken farm lol
Impossible bro...
This vid is actually a really nice change from the traditional hardcore series. It's cool seeing you get so into building something, makes me excited for it too! Cheers SB!
Blue up  my mind
this is so impressive 🤯
What is this guy on
"i need more water" more like "i need more bullets"
Now gona trap clownpierce in friend or foe 😂😅😅 lol 😅😅😅😅😂❤
Sb gona say now I am he end of the world now I am herobrine 😂😂😅😅❤
This factory design is becoming very famous
how? .... BRO JUST HOW!?
great, now go touch some grass
How did the grass regenerate? Very intresting AND confusing video😂
Sb737 has more knowledge tahn einstien would ever has
Why you do never fail to amaze me?
Why is it, when the question is "how to obtain the unobtainable", the answer is always "downgrade to 1.12.2"? That's kinda cheesy. With the file manipulation, version switching, and the abuse of lag machines, you can make numerous types of item duplicators and get infinite of any and every item you want. I don't like it.
I don't know if this works or not, but you can make that shape (of the end gateway portal) and then join or build a machine (you can just join i guess because you can build it where ever you want) and you will have 2 farms then. (Also if you read this, please PLEASE like the comment cuz my comment have never been liked by any creator, famous or not. Thanks)
SB737 one step closer to becoming the next MumboJumbo            Fun Fact: He changed the normal title (I survived days in minecraft hardcore) to a new one telling what he makes. [I actually liked the normal one ;( ]
Now this is the guy who thinks nothing is impossible!
Maskgun music in background at start
Props to him for making a unique factory design, unlike others...
Raise your hand if you’ve watched since day 1
Try to get a end portal frame
Damn SB!!! This was seriously impressive!!! You never cease to amaze
🤚
Sb737 be like I want to make this hard core world the best hard core in the world 🌍 that's why he came up with these ideas that I have never even heard before
🖐🏾
If you make a bedrock portal that will be cool
Bro put hardcore minecraft a nother level
Legend status!
Put your hand 🖐️ up if you have one of he’s posters
Great video, but a bit disappointed the farm wasn't finished on either day 737 or 7370, hoping he is saving those for even bigger and better things!  (also recommendation sb, maybe go back to the shorter video format, most of your new videos are too long to mantain interest, at least from me, just sayin)
On console u could just use a bucket of powder snow and instantly get bedrock and get several stacks an hour
anyone else notice at 19.02 it says day 7080 and hes in creative
when is friend or foe out sb ?
SB I love that you have focused more on quality on the video to match the minecraft youtube trend like you said. I have a suggestion that you you focus putting those info graphic cool animation at the beginning of the video to attract more attending when people click on your video. I know that these graphics take a long time to be made and you might have to hire someone, so having it at the beginning can also help the viewer understand the overall interesting plan of your video and they will have more attention span on the video
I have 10000 god apple
🤚
It used to be really easy to get bedrock on bedrock edition using snow golems
sb always reminds me of mumbo jumbo
I’m new here but a sand/otherfallingblocks like gravel powdered concrete
Thank you for the vid
Mojang: Bedrock is an unminable block wich makes it unfarmable etc. Sb737: What did u say again?
didn't get a single word what he said but enjoyed it . Great video 🤣🤣💀💀
a Bedrock farm. what on earth does this guy do some extreamly risky and cool things!
3:09 the sand grind never stops
sign if you want him to make a ender dragon farm.
Awesome
But heres the question: What will you use the Bedrock for?
insane
WE GOT A BEDROCK FARM BEFORE GTA 6
I just started watching this series and I'm immediately interested.
Sb impressive   😊
this is sick
Man, I will literally break into your house to destroy your computer if someone from my players does this on my server...😅
Now get command blocks jk
your genius
Love the way he explains what he’s doing. I feel like most YouTubers just say it works and builds it
This is a BANGER, SB737 is about to explode with this new style of content.
Great video 👏 Question : when you downgrade a world do chunks that you are loading ( chunk loaders ) get broken too ?
Stop spamming me
imagine using this for a infinite diamond farm
This build looks great every build seems to get more & more beautified. Grian is quaking in his boots 🤣
Soon, SB737 will have a hard time getting more sand
Bro Can be fixe any probleme in the whole World, but choose Minecraft
I think this is the first HC video that he made that doesn't require to watch previous episodes
✋🏿
awsome sb
I knew if someone were to achive this solo you would be the one
So dedicated op
People who think there is no one who can make you want to play minec- 👇
The effort and editing quality is noticeably better with this episode. I dont mind waiting if this is the end product. Keep it up sb ❤
Get barriers
17:00
Yo sb slow down, I'm only on day 3600
This is one of the best videos I have ever seen
His end build just can't catch a break can it lmao
A acookiegod vid😂 love your videos
i love how the videos are a litte bit shorter, it makes them so much easier to watch. this is a great new format
Amazing episode
imagine if he missplaced a bedrock
I really dont like this youtube culture of 1 person that makes something and then everyone makes that. SB might have been caught in the factory trend but atleast he made it look cool and not rushed. Goodjob SB❤️
Mud flaps has collected every armor trim in hardcore
i never comment but damn this is genuinely so creative
31:14 *yes* yes it is the END of the world
Bro can you do 100 days in vault hunter mod plz
Minecraft is way to easy now
I think that the day counter have to be bigger👍
I like 0b0t this a dupe with chuck saving when u left an compress the chunk so it dupe and u can still have the items
What if you made the bedrock portal in your portal room
Sb hi i want you to get the end portal fram😈😈
Mans pulling off everything in minecraft. I think theres not a farm that doesnt exist in his world by now
This is somehow much more understandable than Calculus
Hey sb, wondering how u plan your amazing builds? Trying to see how I can build some cool stuff in my world too. Also love your videos, great job!
RIP to Kevin the chicken
All 10 Unobtainable Blocks in Minecraft:   1. Bedrock 2. End Portal Frame 3. Budding Amethyst 4. Monster Spawner 5. Impulse Command Block 6. Repeating Command Block 7. Chain Command Block 8. Frogspawn 9. End Portal 10. End Gateway
Bro ur the most creative guy i know :D
This has gotta be one of my favorite hardcore vids.  It looked so professional (great job Dez!) The bedrock factory was incredible!  The beacon drills and just the aesthetics of the factory are so ingenious great job SB!  Not to mention YOU FARMED BEDROCK!
Now when he makes Videos with titles, I built a bedrock farm in hardcore Minecraft It doesn't Suprise me. Sb737 is my favorite youtuber
Yeah! I saw this coming from light years away!😂😂😂
The map is download?
???
Sorry I am late ❤
Do you do so much Redstone in this video😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Do u use lightmatica?
why did you do a bedrock farm instead of diamond mining for the armour trims is it just for a change of work
10:02 Cookiegod needs to learn from sb for the item waterfalls
Bro went from making gold farm to literal a bedrock farm 😭😭😂😂
New achievements
Now get portal frames😈
Can we just appreciate his improvement in editing  \
Good job
2 things. why is everyone stealing acookiegods thumnail  styles and u dident even give him credit. also sb in diamond armour who wouldve thought and also this vid is my fav from all the 7000 days
Bro’s the Albert Einstein of minecraft
Please dont become like Cookie god i like him but its good that threre are multiple sorts of hardcore yters
this is just mental
Minecraft need the industrial update with machines and part because right now we have redston slime and honey
What comes next ? Spawning Herobrine in Hardcore Minecraft :D
Sb move the farm over 1 block and you can get the end gateway I'm pretty shure
SB really is big brain
its a good idea to build like a giant npp next to the bedrock factory. luv ur vids
This is the sort of stuff SciCraft was doing. Amazing (that's also why they stayed on version 2.12 for so long)
Now use those bedrock blocks to make a wither farm
Thank you so much for the explanation it helped me with my extremely slow brain
I know you were trying to explain, but it was a little confusing
SB, who needs a staircase when you can fly:). I love ur videos thx for working hard!:)
Bro your nether rite armour of making different types of armour skin you store them safe??
Congrats on #15 on main trending!!
Bro is stealing the idea of  factory to store something from "acookiegod". just why?
can you dupe with this glitch?
🖐🏽
That video is a banger! Well worth the wait!
Wow
Mojang : Bedrock is not obtainable in survival Minecraft. SB737 : Let me introduce you to the fastest bedrock farm in Minecraft
Amazing work. I knew ittt.
Honestly sb this is a banger video keep it up I watched all of this with a smile on my face ❤😊 i hope you see this ❤
Watch the next video be something like, I OBTAINED BARRIERS IN HARDCORE MINECRAFT!
Nice
Why do i feel like he is in creative then i remember he is in hardcore
nah coz i swear ive watched SB make the bedrock farm thing before like the tnt lag machine the savestate machine thing the enderpearl laucher i swear to god ive seen this video before
How did he find it from and how did that guy or whoever figured it out make this like it would take ages and who would think that this would work
How tall are you
Bro i downloaded a bunch of your videos to keep me from getting bored inaide a cruise thanks so much
We need timelapse when you build! Could be nice
Really good explanation
Give the credit to a cookie god
Sb I think you should use vanilla tweaks
Your building has got a lot better
U should build a string duper
SB has really leveled up his building. Love the factory design!
Dude I have started watching you since you started the 100 days series! What a journey it was over the past 2 years!
I didn't like the original fast-paced videos so much, but I really enjoyed watching this one
I understand that game devs need such tricks for performance but such utterly broken bugs would be totally unacceptable in an enterprise Java environment
Only ogs know
Bro made a cow cooker 2.0 the chicken cooker
Really good sb737 video!
At first I thought this was an Acookiegod video… 😅😅 This is an amazing video and extremely in SB style
Sb i love your videos
How sb how can you farm literally every block😂😂
lan? but i love it
Pretty freaking cool ngl
Opp😊
That video is so cool but can you make like a world to see how its builded? I really want to try this. Thank you in advance :). If you want I can pay too
I’ve been watching this series from the start and you’re making bedrock farms now
Ayo I read a comment saying SB737 videos be like "I built a bedrock farm" and it actually happened
Well, Igobylotsofnames (igblon) has made a better farm, even tho it was in bedrock like 1/2 years ago, but, you have done it in Java
Big Brain SB737 10000000000iq!!
another great vid btw sb
How many people actually understood sb? I think I understood most of it... idk
make a bedr ock house
SB is a new GOD in Minecraft , he spends 1000 hours to build this GOD  machine which can break unbreakable bedrock
Mann the people who made this bedrock farm are more intelligent than Einstein 💀💀💀 fr
Nice work!!! This is probably the best hardcore video I've ever seen!
That  Was awesome
I hope he dos not put any bedrock in his house
Now downgrade another time to get command blocks and everything else 😅
Yooooo sb can you should  build a sand duper and it works on gravle and concrete powder
Make a bedrock beacon!
Loved the cookie type of factory
5:57 how about smoke coming out of the factory chimneys ?
Amazing
Sb, have you even seen the inside of a factory
Sb737 is super big BRAIN
Bro is literally" Walter White" of Minecraft❤‍🔥🔥
SB never fails us. Good job Daniel
why u saying "CHONK" and not chunk
Cookie god copie
علی عسل ✓✓
Are the end portal gateways a whole new end islands or is it just to teleport to a new area
the factory is an inspiration from thecookiegod
Whoever watched this series since the first day one can raise their hand🤚
i like this new version of the videos
I love all the detail in the factory build
That chunk savestate method can be used to get infinite diamonds to as how much you mine you reset it and diamonds still there again 🥹🥹
Congrats, SB!
love the videos sb keep up the good work  I would love it if you could make the updated hardcore world on bedrock as a mod  thanks
Me :building a 3x3 piston door thinking im great at redstone  SB :spending 33 hours to build a bedrock farm in minecraft    Great video SB and i love your dedication and how you always find a way to entertain us ❤
11:22 What do you mean it looks 'pretty' good?!?! You've created a masterpiece!Love you SB❤ I am your OG Fan and have been seeing you from 6 years....! And you are still my favorite...❤❤
If sb needs a simple item he will just build a farm for it
Sb has filled his brain with knowledge
😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
Let's vote for 20 days 20 videos challenge
Waited for so long
since you have bedrock now whats the next step in the world?  Also did you get the desgin of the machine you use to get the bedrock from the sci-craft
bro plese continue this series to 50000 days
you do realise you could’ve done the read-only region files thing to the end spawn, nether spawn and even advancements right?
SB won't dupe sand He won't dupe diamonds or netherite But using save states in 1.12 to get bedrock is ok U can place diamonds in a chunk, savestate it, move the diamonds to another chunk, reload and the diamonds will be in both chunks This is the fabric for duping
Just started watching him and realized that his hardcore world is over 7000+ days and he still has diamond armor and tools, maybe its time for an upgrade to netherite (I just started watching him so don't roast me dang)
I have been watching this series since the first installment, and personally I enjoy this style of video more. It feels like having each video be its own project is more enjoyable and probably more easy for you to do. I also really appreciate you putting the day counter in despite the format changing. Keep it up!
I remmeber that this one spanish youtuber callled ElRichMC made a bedrock farm, manipulating the data of falling sand, making a falling block of bedrock, i believe his method was faster I was mindblown as he did this with every "ilegal" block in the game The only problem is that the guy used a farm that was alteast 10 times more complicated to set up
*Me who only ever wears boots literally no matter what*
The only guy Who would enslave Baby chickens for a block just so he can
The video got pretty obvious after the "leaks"
Bro please tell me you are getting rest you look restless
Sb i bought your friend or foe poster
I quit hypixel skyblock
SB can do anything111😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Why dont you just mine the bedrock 🤔🤓
You should string your entire town or just the building in it so it look better
The editing on this vid was sick SB!
The editing was sick on this vid SB!
How to break Minecraft in every way possible
sb is the best Minecraft youtuber out there and has inspired me to make my own Youtube channel (Nandominecraft) thank you sb (i have not posted yet)
Hey Sb missed your videos where you been 12 weeks 😫
couldn't you just throw a ton of shulkers with diamond blocks into the chunk, then make it not save, pick back up the shulkers, then just .. duplicate anything? don't even need a bedrock farm if you can do that.. just would need one bedrock (which I assume would be more simple).
minecraft is no longer same
use a duplication glitch to get more bedrock
Sb you probably wont see this comment, but i f you do i want to let you know that i am extremely impressed and entertained by the cool new ideas you come up with. Also your editing is awesome :)
Fan at 2012
"Forcing these GUYS to LAY EGGS"
you could place 2 of these shulker boxes where your friend is building something and then it will disappear 😅
You have spent 0.293 years in this world I used my brain
Every hardcore youtuber started making factories for farms
now get this following blocks 😈: barrier, command block of every type, structure void, light block, fire block, soul fire block, end portal frame, deny, allow, border block, structure block, jigsaw, bubble collumn tile, nether portal block and end gateway portal block.
The god of minecraft is back    He can make anything🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
pov: the person who invented the farm
Make a modern house
could you put grey maps in front of the honey blocks to make it look better?
sb i wish i could get your sighed poster but my parents wont let me get it i really wish i could I'm sorry :( P.S i watched you since i was 6
i bet at some point sb737 is gonna farm command blocks or something
I'm here just like I said
A legendary series crafted by a legendary man
The end base is definitely my favourite build of his. If you see this comment your favorite build/farm of his
Such an epic video and I’m so happy you’ve done it. Good job you deserve all these views.
Imagine if Parrot watched this.
I really want more Modded 100 Days Videos like the RL Craft video or Adding a mod every day.
What glint mod is sb737 using
FINALLY MORE HARDCORE!!!!
If he's in 1.12, how come all his textures are post-1.14? Must be a texture pack
Very good video
Why you only make survival videos anything alse you can do to make a YouTube chenel like joining servers playing bedwars on hypixel and joining the donut smp and dream smp and lampat smp stop your survival videos plzz 🙏🏼
SB plz continue your cave only world
Fun fact I like sb737.
friend and foe plssss
once a man put so much effort on obtaining Bedrock he deserves it
Hey SB, if you put unbreaking 3 on elytra in 18w21a, rename it and then load the world in 18w23c, then you will get an elytra with protection 3.
Hey SB, if you put unbreaking 3 on elytra in 18w21a, rename it and then load the world in 18w23c, then you will get an elytra with protection 3.
Okay but this is so impressive. I can barely make a super smelter with a tutorial. Dude is a true genius
can we all apreciate how much time sb takes to make us good content
That is so badass. This reminds me of when you built the machine to go to the world border just really badass game breaking stuff.
I’m very happy that this channel is changing to become better. You will definitely reach 10 million if you keep on going like this!
i remember when this world was only 4 days old and now 7000 amazing work SB
why do you need bedrock? good video btw.
This man is devoted to getting literally everything even if it’s impossible
The editing is so good 🔥 I love this man
Is there a way to get your world by chance?
These edits are great! did you get a new editor?
داشم علی عسل صد سال پیش اینکارو کرد❤😂
I think you could put slime on other pieces of bedrock
sb. when is the next friend or foe.
I am learning so much new things. You should be a teacher or something damn your so good at explaining stuff. Amazing video
Next time he’s going to get a command block…
Sb is an absolute genius😮😮
I’ve seen this in a gamerzreact and it’s insane
SB737 has a degree in minecrafting
This was one of the best videos I've ever seen! This was truly crazy!!!  Falling block at 10k?
i got ban from your sever for ever for aking people to join my realm
Nothing is impossible for SB737
I’m pretty sure SB qualifies as a scientist at this point. Crazy work.
😢 rip netherite armor you will be missed 😢😢  Sb737 i really need you to get netherite armor back or i will unsubscribe
I love how SB said Chinese characters are complex lol
No mods
How
Get  barer
Can you not put item frames on the honey blocks, to hide the honey blocks? Just a suggestion, if its possible
🤚🏻
What an epic journey! Kudos to getting bedrock. I think that surpasses all the achievements you have lost reloading your game!  Keep up the good work, and I can't wait for the next vid!  And a shout out to the Editor! Kudos!
11:27 AND 16:36 there is a typo... the phase 2 says "Downgrade: Version 1.2" it's 1.12 lol
ggs
There is literally nothing you can't do in minecraft
Thanks for the shoutout my friend! That auto chunk save state machine of yours was perfect. Made your bedrock farm truly automatic 👍
ElRichMc had a better farm, but still super cool!
This created by yourself??
That was nearly an end of his World
Your world downloads are amazing! Please can you build a train station from Spawn to each and every point of interest in your world. Be great to help me find everything next time I get to play 😅
next farm command blocks :troll:
Version 1.2😂
31:14 it is literally the end of the world... its the end... get it?
SB i see that u have learned aCookieGod's buiging, with the factory, Honey, and the bedrock in front
Another way for SB to make his farm faster is to make ender pearl stasis chambers so he can teleport back to the middle and go the other way in the same auto save. If you think SB should do this like so he sees it. 👇
If he can downgrade to 1.12 he can get all of unobtainables
Hi sb ive been here since day 1 of the series
I can't believe SB down graded 3 times in his hardcore world
u could try and get command blocks or something illegal with a farm like u did with bedrock.
Yeah, it was a small Redstone contraption.
Bro can do a everything😊
The phase 2 sign said 1.2 not 1.12
😎😎
So next block is command block? Its possible to get
This guy is incredibly intelligent and such hard working ! You’re doing awesome man you’re crazy !
That was cool!
Reinforced deep slate next. 😝
Now time for command blocks :)
Man knows to much
Awesome stuff as usual, cheers for the entertainment.
Btw he probably used a texture pack that added 1.14 textures for 1.12
it is the best video you have made good job
I'll say what most of us are probably thinking...this video feels completely illegal lol.
This is the perfect video for one of those "I love the dedication" comments
Sb is the only person who can get items meant for creative mode in hardcore minecraft.
clownpierce new trap
When he built the factory I thought he got the idea from aCookieGod who builds factories for everything. Let's appreciate how he always comes up with new ideas and never lets his subscribes down. ❤
E
SB just took factory builds to another level
seems like the most pointless grind at the cost of potentially breaking everything.
Now we need a command block farm.
In bedrock edition you can get bedrock easily by justusing some tnt and end crystal
Bedrock beacon 😂
That was a great video
SB you are actually insane
When SB starts spouting mumbo jumbo you know it's a good video
Watching this awesome video this made me feel like if someone watched it from a villagers perspective that would be so wired. one villager would be saying to the other like: 'and then after farming the unobtainable rock he just appeared inside the wood farm, those were a crazy few months for us.'; 'He has the power to change the world'
Build a computer in survival it would take ages but it would be so cool
Now DUPE bedrocks! I found out that you duped the books in the test world! The books was still in your inventory when you took it out of the hopper Minecart but the chunk wasn't safe so everything in the chunk reset including the books in the chest! Now  do same with bedrock!
How many deserts has SB destroyed at this point 🤣🤣
How many days was this the day counter disappeared
me try to understand math, me also understanding everything in the video
You should’ve used a 1.12 duplication glitch bro😢
You should've gotten other illegal items like end portals frames and barrrier blocks.
yooo!!! the first mane hardcore vids title doesnt contain "100 days"
SB WHAT HAPPEND TO YOUR EYES AT  THE 30 MINUTE MARK!
does it take you a long time to load into your world?
could i please  borrow some of your ideas like the staircase for my survival world?
Hey SB, are you aiming for 737M subs before 2024 cause your channel is going to BOOM when this video becomes popular.
I love how sb did a factory, but made it 10x better than every other YouTuber who just do the same format for every video.
I actually amazes me how smart he is. He has to do a iq test or something, I need to know
Now farm my mom
Can't wait for you to accidentally place one in a stupid place
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ARMOUR TRIMS
Capybara
this is the best video from sb imo i really like it keep up the good work and take some rest 😃
Sb should make a fully functioning computer in his world
SB737 I think you should make Cubicmeters god particle farm. It produces 5 god particles every 10 game ticks. That takes you from level 0-68 instantly
Hi I've been here SINCE DAY 100!!!!!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO GET TO DAY 8000!!!!
How bro? Pls reply
Bro can do anything in Minecraft now
i think if he invested materials  in a minecraft rail system yes it may be slower but it wouldnt consume durability on elytras or fireworks withc ment he could have done it  longer  so long they had the enderpearls for it but its cool  as is
Sb737 always does the impossible 😂 Great video SB❤😊
He build a factory like aCookieGod
You’re not a true SB 737 fan if you don’t remember who Miles and the turtles are.
The amount of nostalgia to the start of the 100 days series by some of the music is amazing. Keep up the good work. 👍
How is dream still the best Minecraft player with sb in town
I thought this was going to be a cookie like video because of the factory but you definitely on uped him
I think it's funny how you build a bedrock farm but refuse to build a sand farm.
amazing
Rules of nature? I think you mean suggestions of animals
minecraft be like u cant obtain bedrock sb737 be like lets make a bedrock farm
SB next video I built an end portal farm in minecraft hardcore
How in the world does SB have only 4 million subss!!!
Man’s dedication is insane
the first man ive seen to farm one type of minecraft in another
i remember waking on a sunday morning and feeling exited to watch your 400 days video i cant believe you have made it past 7000 days
And so begins "the transition"
Hi sb ,I think it would be really cool if you created green hill zone in your hardcore world ,maybe if you had a large mountain (to hide the area behind it) and then in that mountain was an opening with a big golden ring that you could walk through as if it where a portal that would bring you into the zone would be awesome! Loved this video btw keep up the good work 👍
Crazy he never fails to disappoint keep up the good work ❤️
Bro is about to get the debug stick
Scicraft brakes bedrock with a wooden pickaxe
There are by now much faster bedrock farms which rely on asynchronous observer lines. You still do the trick with the silk touch and the fire, but you no longer need the end gateway, because async observer lines can create bedrock anywhere by using word tearing. This is for example shown in ElRichMC's 1.12 survival series in episode 156 at roughly the 8:00 minute mark.  But it's still nice seeing people use the old end gateway method.
Love the video!
Nothing is impossible for SB! Love your videos man!!!!!
With the savestating thing couldn’t u put a chest full of diamond blocks in a savestated chunk and take them fly away and fly back and shouldn’t they be there again idk if I’m right can u tell me
Its crazy how his world started as a 100 days and now it ummmm a bit more than that :) lol
I watched it and I never new there was such a thing besides how Kolanii got it. Love the vids SB have watched EVERY SINGLE HARDCORE VIDEO. hope I can be as big (nah I'm just kidding I can't) as you on YouTube someday. Just hit 100 subscribers and I'm pumped lol
get an automatic button presser or something like that and program it to do this automatically
Please farm barriers next
😮
I’m only 8min in, but I’m hoping SB notices that when he used water to remove all the snow in the factory, he accidentally converted half of the concrete powder into concrete on the caution stripe
Put campfires and hay bales for smoke on the pilars
In bedrock basically all you need to do to get bedrock is grow a tree and blow it up. I just obtained it in my world, I just need to dupe it now. I only allow myself to dupe illegal items I may get.
WHY IS MY GUY 10000000000000 IQ?
Who else misses the old sb (awesome world) 👇
he didnt pop a totem!
R.I.P. god armour you used for 6900 days for bedrock😢
for the factory at real worker like childer----
This does feel better than the previous hardcore minecraft videos.
God damm, the ideas, editing and videos just keel getting better. Keep up the great work sb!
I think he died or smth cuz the vids are getting stale icl
I love the editing, it’s a combination of your 100 days videos and other hardcore video. It’s a great change as I think the 100 days trend was dying off a bit. Keep up the amazing work ❤
Command block farm, barrier farm, structure block farm, reinforce deepslate farm, and jigsaw farm when
U can do this same to get infinite netherites diamonds sands etc etc then as well but don't do it not worth it at all
27:23 no way bro said "very2 easy" 💀
WOW!!!!
next you make all of the minecraft minigames in your mc hardcore world!
if you want there is light blocks in the stronghold library… in bedrock edition… maybe there is some in java?
This is amazing!
how do i download the texturepack you used to make 1.12 look like 1.14 i need that texture pack so much pls
Sb have you got prime
You were meant to destroy diamond armor not wear you have  become the very thing you swore to to destroy
Sb in your next video you should build a city in Minecraft for your villagers
bro hasnt built with a single piece of wood in his entire life
We need a bedrock portal now!
27:23 no way bro said "very2 easy" 💀
One way that you could make it faster is you could use stasis chambers and teleport back to do the second one in the opposite direction in the same auto save.
he did it, he is literally the god of hardcore
I would be scared to have this, what if I accidentally encased myself in it then, I would be stuck
i love how the decoration has evolved
idea for your minecraft Hardcore world is a museum for the 1000 posters then your house is not too full
Damn every single one of his videos are a blast
We´ve waiteted weeks and FINALLY there is a new Episode.  I´m so hyped
I had a dream about you doing all of this with some parts left out but it was very detailed... I even dreamt about the thumbnail..?
Mojang:bedrock impossible to obtain. SB:hey guys let's make a bedrock farm!
Just dupe the bedrock LOL
Kan you get end-portal-frames and make your own endportal?
Wow, in my opinion one of the best videos! Loved how you explained how it works!
an extremely good video from an extremely good lad, as expected ofc, love your vids SB and remember to not force or rush yourself for us.
Next hell be making a reinforced deepslate farm 😭😭
Sb Is Unstoppable
Bro SB u actually put so much time into mc u need mental help but in a good way
NPCs flocking to the comments to comment the same thing they comment on every video
mum sb posted
🔥🔥🔥💪
Ur scientists
wow
There is a much smaller much easier one in bedrock edition
23:50 ah yes abusing rails. my favorite.
I was hoping this was a 1.20 farm, pretty dissapointed that he downgraded, in anycase that means he lied in the community post when he said he would be making the first automatic bedrock farm  Except for the fact he is probably the first person to build it in hardcore
I feel like he watched a couple episodes that aCookieGod made because this factory design looks quite like his. It's a really good build too!
In what minectaft java version can you combine fire and blast protection
Never end this project, you are insane
lets go 10k days 🎉❤
so now u are not writyng the days in the title?!!
Deserves 1M likes only
Notch be like; I did not meant Minecraft to be like this!
Props to the people who found this out
awesome video as always 😊
It may not be the biggest and best thing in this video, but SB, that build genuinely looks like a grian build! Well done this vid was sick
Mic got bad at like 12 minutes
imagine miss clicking in 32:00
you could have merged the nethers to get it back without breaking your end base but great video!
Yo he’s finally got the best farm🎉
I literally have netherite and don’t have a base
The video is significatly shorter than previous 100days videos, I miss the old 1hr videos 🥲
Don’t make factories in your world it will mess with the climate
Hey Sb you really need to understand the scenario here  You are the nerd and we are the bullys so if we tell you to do our homework then we are saying to just complete it and give it and not explain the whole thing and if you do that then we bullys beat you up   And this is the real life scenario you need to understand that we don't need the process and the explanation We just need the finished product
Banger
@25:9
Dang
I wonder where he got the factory idea from… 🍪
meanwhile the guys who got command blocks in survival:
Great job sb best hardcore vid ever
Suggestion: sb you can add red unlit candles near the tnt in the factory which makes it look like dynamite which adds a cool effect of tnt lol
15:19  That is always me. I always look at the sand collapsing and hyperfixate on it.
What does it sound like, I watch it a lot of people like the series 100 days in minecraft waiting for 7000 to 7100 and on
Awesome
These just keep getting better
I like the factory is quite accurate also, apart from the redstone touch thing that was a random move
W
It will be so much easier to just put a huge glass roof over your entire part of your world, it'll take long but snow won't cover everything
thancks
Woooow ❤❤
Click here if you just witnessed  minecraft History😮  👇
You can get 76 bedrock per hour if you get 1 bedrock every 45 seconds
wouldnt all the netherite armor from his getting every armor trim be deleted?
Hey just want to say that I think you can use one of those auto movement thing where you can record a movement infâme and then set it to do it ingame in a loop, like this it’s automatic and you can go AFK (I’m not an expert but here’s the idea at least)
U could use tnt minecarts on black concrete
remember when he did that in the console world?
You are a genius
My brain hurts
Bro got a phd in redstone
alright, this has to be the most cursed thing to do in minecraft
Ive watched you for a few years as a huge fan. This by far is one of the craziest videos that you have done. I love the research and development of your own farm, plus the explanation of the work that you did. Then all of the cut scenes and just stuff to polish up the video. A++ man
ANIMAL ABUSE
Loved the video! This is so so cool!!! Goodjob to you and the editor and thank you!
I was waiting for this video from so long 😭😭 finallyyyyyyy a good dopamine release
As an npc i am obliged to say, Can we just appreciate how much effort sb puts into making videos for us😅
best mc youtuber ever
Get command blocks next
"A lot of clever Minecraft players" bro is 2000 iq in Minecraft
You should get Barrier or command block
Bro when are u gonna mine diamond for places u have taken diamond from
This man made the impossible, possible. Just had to go 22 days over the limit
When is the Command Block Farm??
Where's your every single armour project
Watch SB get a ton of bedrock to trap clowns log off spot so he cant get out
In bedrock edition funnily enough it’s much easier to get bedrock, you just grow a dark oak under the centre portal in the end whilst summoning the ender dragon and blow up a tnt next to the bedrock
You could've get back your ultimate helmet while you were in that version 😭
Claim your "here within a day" ticket right here
i like how you are adapting cookie's style . its a nice lil change
Do you know I been here at 100 days or sky block 100 days I'm your big fan your fun to watch and keep up the good work I'm writing if you see this tysm
Can you do a insane craft series
All that for a 32:31 minute video sad but i loved the video you work so hard just for us good work 😊
I think you should try better Minecraft
Nice video king 👑
i remember seeing this in the scicraft server
4:03 bro realy put homedepot checkout sounds😂
Cool 👍
Don’t tell me I am 8 sec late
Wow 27:11
Stop neglecting old projects
Sb737 i wanted to know if you make all your builds by yourself or if you use a tutorial to make them .(Mainly talking about the factory) regardless they are super cool and impressive to make and i would like to know about your process when building!
This was very inspring. Love a good sb video :)
That's so insane, nothing can stop you anymore! This game truly has no limits in your world!  Also I almost had a heart attack when your elytra broke and you fell I wasn't sure if you'd survive. Would've been so sad.
When are you next posting friend or foe on sb737plus? By the way love your videos keep up the great work.
Day 1,000,000: Okay guys so today we will build a machine INSIDE of Minecraft that is gonna let us Time Travel in real life! Also shoutout to my last video where I built a machine that lets me enter CREATIVE mode in real life!
✋️
ty for changing the title of the video from the lame: "I survived x,xxx days in Minecraft hardcore " to something that grabs people's attention and highlights the main idea in the video. Also the editing is way better!! More excitement, and keeps the audience on the video
A exploit from the 2b2t
4:19 that’s me!
U ARE A BEAST!
command block?
I'm not even baffled anymore as to what SB can do in his Minecraft world. From building the most OP machines, farms, mechanisms, creations, getting god armour, creating two very op farms to get to the world border, collecting every single animal in hardcore, collecting every single block in Minecraft, its honestly incredible amazing. The list goes on and on as to the truly incredible yet impossible things that he has made possible.
I know i comment about him all the time, but elrichmc made a farm that farms every block including bedrock, and then a farm that produces bedrock very very fast
I think Professor SB forgot to mention that in this one we might need to take notes. Nevertheless great lecture can't wait for follow up
Did you know you can make a 2x2x2 chicken farm?
If SB turned his bedrock factory into a parkour map (or hide and seek map) and put it on the marketplace I would play it
Where Kevin the Chicken ? WHY IS HE DEAD?
Who will tell him about the block collection?
Mojang: Bedrock is impossible to obtain in survival. 🤡 SB737: Are you sure about that? 😂💀
Can you do a bedrock edition 100 days
your a genious and also crazy at the same time
Does this auto sorting system still work in 1.20
You can do it my king
I love your videos you are really inspiring and fun.❤️
Can you put your world up for download for PS4 & PC?
Bro take 1 and half hour to make a mega mob farm but only half an hour to obtain 7 stacks of bedrocks ur content is definitly the most impressive🎉
I don't know if you realize but your bedrock factory looks eerily similar to Carvs Diamond factory. Could be similar design thinking but I didn't see any credit
24:21 what is that robotic spin is it macro
This man is born to make world records in their hardcore world 😊
Wow such a good video, you did a great job explaining how everything works even though its so complicated.
you did an amazing job explaining all the mechanics of the contraption!
Actually the way of Rich MC is a little bit faster but he has the world in 1.12 and he didn't have to downgrade the world so the way you got bedrock is also impresive
this man is the new sandiction
oh how far we've come from 500k to 4 million. Good job on the videos, man!
Awesome. :o
The factory was from the cookie god the outside part
SB fans never fail to make NPC comments.
Love your videos and everything you post :D. You give me so much inspiration for my minecraft world :D.
bros playing like cookie also sb i like the i survived 7100 days titles better
3 hour team
Now get a life😢😅
i've only seen this done on servers like scicraft, with a team of pro builders and redstoners working together, but this man did it by himself! Major props!
10:28 why not use pistons
YEs finally I love your vids
bro had an emerald palace, planet, teleportation building, full netherite beacon and a bedrock factory but not a chicken farm
I really like the editing in this one. It's feels really produced but in a good and genuine way, if that makes sense. You can tell Dezro did a lot of work and enjoyed doing it!
Goddamn, these videos are amazing every single time, you actually manage to increase the quality and stakes EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm okay with waiting on your uploads if they're this good. Keep it up dawg :)
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT ❤❤❤
I like how he used Creative mode to cheat set Bedrock in
I wanna see play on the bliss smp
just thigh he build a duper with chunk saveing data
In 1.12 u can obtain all of the other blocks, for example end portals which is even better than bedrock. Elrichmc did it
Yo my pro
Pre 10k likes lez go
we all see the quality improvement and we all love it keep up the good work
The bedrock farm is obviously cool, but we also need a moment to appreciate how big and detailed that factory was
The fact that he had to learn all the complicated mechanics and stuff is really impressive
I love the new changes, SB! Especially the little "mini-cutscenes." They make the content feel as if you've put your heart and soul into it.
What glint mod are you using
W
Hi pls try to play in pocket edition pls 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
such and epic video sb!
Missed opportunity to make a planet wisp like factory Still looks really good tho 👍🏾
what is the name of the resource pack you use to see what in the shulker box in you inv
Ngl when sb was building the factory I feel like he was playing roblox tycoon but he was the generator
My mind is blown into pieces ! Thats just all i am gonna say...
Tip: You should add hay bale campfires to the smoke emitters (or whatever there called) on to of the factor to make it look like smoke is coming out from the top
incredible
The editing on this is lit 🔥
Sb737 is so great i was wondering why he hadnt uploaded on his main channel but the wait was so worth it. (ps an idea for your next vid: do everything you said you would do later)
Best editing
Is the farm one time use only?
SB737 is legend of Minecraft ❤❤❤
SB I HAVE A QUESTION : YOU MADE MINECRAFT RIGHT 🤣
broooooo this guy THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE EXPECTED OF SB!!!
This is the best video in the history of history ❤❤❤😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😅❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i think physics is easier than this
Sb I have a question.... Is it possible to build a farm like this in a other vetsion than 1.12? You know changing that slimeblock to tnt using a different lag Machine.... Because i would likr to have bedrock yet not update from 1.7.2. Thx
man I remember 12 year old me watching this guy play bedwars till 1am at night and i'm glad he's still doing great
I love sp great YouTuber keep up the good work
i didnt think many youtubers would bother to do this, but im glad that sb did im also glad that the end hub didnt get completely destroyed, it only did about as much damage as those dragons did-
Really good😊
In one of your next hardcore videos, you should finish the armour trims and fix some things in your world. For example: your netherhub, some old farms, maybe make some a building around some farms, ...
Hi
This is one of the best hardcore minecraft videos of 2023!
man i can't join ur discord I got falsely banned
OF COURSE!!!!!! sci craft is the solution to everything at thats in 1.12
Anyone else think we should petition for him to join hermitcraft?
I was so excited for this dude. Thanks for this amazing content and youre amazing. Bedrock is nothing, im sure u will get much more.
Time to obtain end portal blocks in Hardcore next !
Now make a structure block farm 😈
Can you tell me how to be so extremely motivated cause I do YouTube for fun to but not so motivated like you
Epic!
Seeing him reach 7k days is really really important to me because I had watch from the Xbox series, which was the original series and was an amazing adventure.  7000 DAYS🎉🎉🎉 KEEP UP THE WORKKKK🎉🎉🎉
SB-Savage boss
Must have seen scicraft lol
@cookiegod you must watch this
For the next episode, please make a hundred days of you just fixing your world. We would all really appreciate.
That's incredible. Well done
Send this to parrot. He made an entire video on trying to do this.
THIS IS INSANE
bro farming what mojang said unobtainable
That's crazy... (I only understand 25% of the explanation)
Get this man a job in mojang
love it , but its same as cookie
acookiegod will be jealous
better  editing than before, ur best video yet
We want shader
An animal farm to a working bedrock farm!!😮🎉😊
❤
Mojang: You can’t obtain bedrock, let alone farm it! SB: 🗿
What is impossible oh thats not
@SB737 you should build a statue of uou in netherite armor behind he armor trims
This seems like I title from 2018.
SB is just amazing, making impossible things possible and making great and amazing builds
The end hub being destroyed bit by bit and sb saying it will be fixed is the funniest thing ever 😂😂
I remember he did this in his awesome world
Bro sb make totem skin  it will be hood to see ❤❤
sb,what do you want to do with your bedrocks?I'm scared😰😰
Hi can I get your reply??❤❤❤❤
You could go to medical school and cure cancer OR you could figure out how chunk population works🤣
One day this man will make minecraft in mimecraft
Bro is the chunk not loading a potential dupe glitch
Phase 1 2 and 3 r ridickcyls
2:29 every chicken was named 'chicken' except the first on who named 'Kevin the chicken'
Great editing and brillant video SB. Love the hardwork and waiting for more Friend or Foe content 💖💖💖
nah cuz this mans too good to be playing mc, like just give this man 100 mill subs at this point
I'm late but hi
I was slightly worried for this new style, but this video is really cool and it defo worked
aCookieGod's video was uploaded at the same time called "I built a shulker farm ".   Sb's video "I built a Bedrock farm"
Please tell me this guy make backups of his world before any downgrading, i am on the edge of my seat raising my heartbeat when i hear he is downgrading his world
Bring back friend or foe
Great video
Imagine he misplaced a bedrock block at the end lmao
Sb in 7200 days: So this is my reinforced deepslate farm!
the intro is back🔥🔥🔥
next video: I obtained barrier block in minecraft hardcore (yes, it is possible)
And you can duplicate bedrock at 1.16 give baby piglins and kill him
And that was the story when SB737 made history by making bedrock farm In hardcore ❤
he can explain better than my math teacher😂😂😂😂😂😂
One of the best ever sb video
I really really love the video but did you get the factory design of cookiegod
24:13
Sb636 is a legend🎉
I wish to buy ur posters specially 7000 days 1 but I cant afford it with online payments if it's possible pls can u do it on cash on delivery 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The editing in these videos are so good, major props, must take forever to do though lol
I understood nothing but the finished product was insane
BIG W FOR SB
bro started watching aCookieGod
My head hurts
wow
One of the best hardcore world vids!! not rushed, properly executed with phenomenonal editing!!! although it was not as long as the other hardcore day vids it was very close to perfection! you outdone urself SB!! quality over quantity is the key!!! I dont mind waiting longer for a good quality vid and rmb to keep enjoying urself while playing thats the most important!!! :D
In about 5 years time this dude might even have collected command blocks XD😂
Finally, a video not about armour trims.
It's been a while since I watched the Hardcore Series. Haven't watched since 4300 days, but it's good to be back seeing how far he has progressed throughout the series. Keep it up SB
Teacher - the exam is not that hard, trust me The exam - this video
If u where before 24 hours  Then u can like the comment
the bedrock factory really looks like the ellis island immigration building ngl.
Are you using a texture pack? Because the textures didn't change, eventhough you went to 1.12, pre texture update (1.14)
This is revulsion.
When he took longer than usual to upload i knew he was creating a masterpiece
1 hor ticket
HE WASNT LYING
27:20 actually ElRichMC did it about a year ago in his solo survival series using threadstone and falling blocks, scicraft way. It was much slower then, but he's perfected its method. Now, not only is fully automatic, but much faster than this.
🤚
Bro I love the new editing style
Those who are not came from tiktok can like this comment
People going against God... Meanwhile SB angering Gods (not 1, but multiple gods)
There’s a better one that I explained in a previous comment on your post that you don’t have to wait 45 seconds for and it’s automatic
Cookie style build
The impossible is now possible
Cool video
6:54
Bro's making his hardcore world illegal 🤣
Sb you are genius
7:16 What did he say?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bedrock beacon
Great job
SB trying to search the word “impossible” in his Dictionary  ERROR 404 NOT FOUND😈
You have a big brain SB
I waited a week for a 30 mins vid ;(
No way
why did your totem not change texture to pre 1.14?
as a huge fan of sb i just wanna say hes doing great thats why he my fav minecraft youtuber
I can see the additional effort that went into this video! I don't mind the sparser uploads as long as they can be as good as this one.
27:26 You are wrong, the best farm made in vanilla survival can generate ten times more bedrock and is also 1.12 but is also ten times more complicated to build. You can find them in Scicraft for multiplayer and YouTuber ElRichMC in singleplayer
4:31 Only sb could find a practical use for gravel, love the look of the factory!
loved the montages
SB is now an official anti-life minecraft equation solver
I don't understand a lot of how this works but I'm super impressed by it all. You are providing impressive content for us all ..
love ur vids
Comment
How did collecting items from storage take you 10 days? from 7055 to 7065. It is like 3 real life hours!
SB just breaking minecraft at this point
bro just made the unobtainable farm obtainable
This was like listening to a astrophysics video
Can you not just save state the place where a chest is in an ancient city and get infinite notch apples?
*_b r e a d_*
Can’t help but notice the day counter has shrunk, when did that happen
so then you can also get other blocks like reinforced deepslate using this method
I remember sb saying 'im not going to dupe items'
Legendary SB737 W
Sb and docm77 would be best friends if they ever met
like me
yes sb737 is big brain
❤❤❤ love u so so so much;)
Hey SB7373 why didnt you cover the honey blocks in map art so it could look like a different block with the same feature. I feel like honey blocks dont look right in a bedrock factory. Maybe add this in the nest hardcore vid pls do. :)
if you can make a farm for bedrock, can you also, in theory, make a farm for other unobtainable block?
Hi
15:05 gives me vibes of old sb
It looks like some of the concrete powder on the caution line in the factory got turned into concrete at some point, probably when he was removing all the snow
Am i the only one who noticed the day count getting smaller?
Can you please make a full montage of you obtaining every unbreakable block (Hehe not now) in Minecraft because that is a good movie. BTW love your videos, keep up the good work.
⛏🏗
Hey sb u can use glass pane to hide the glass and it will still glow red
mojang is so confused rn lol
I think sb gonna lose his world like due to courrupting cuz he aint gonna die BUT I HOPE U DONT LOSE IT
I liked the little changes you did it was good but I did all ways liked the longer form but everything else was good.
SB is going to find a way to get a command block one day. Seriously though this is one of my favourite hardcore episodes and I liked how you kept the day counter when this isn't a 100 days.
You are unbeatable SB737! There won't be ANYTHING left in Minecraft that SB has not farmed. LOVE FROM INDIA
Honestly! I like these type of video from SB This is just beyond imagination  Please make these type of crazy machines
SB has proven all parents that minecraft is and can be educational
Is there still gonna be Friend or Foe S2 videos? Also keep up the great work SB much love ❤
It would be really funny if sb were to miss click and place a bedrock in his house😂
SB's a freaking genius man. a genius.
I love your vids no matter what
Loving these new type of videos hope you reach your goal of 10m soon
31:12 “It’s repairable, so it’s not the END of the world” 😂😂😂
To get barriers  just go to a snapshot of 1.16 that spawns a barrier under the lava at treasure bastions. Then upgrade to one block at a time, pick it up, put it on ur head, upgrade, take it off, transfer into main world through the nether
1000th comment!!! notice?
crazy
Why is the view count so low this is absolutely cracked
Hey, loved your video, would it work the same way to get a end protal frame?
Like the new style!
สุดยอดครับ
The legend is back!
Hey do you think you could leave the Schematics you use for your builds in the description?
That was cool!
SB737 you have come so far, from building every farm to reaching the world border to now getting bedrock and farming it in Hardcore!
SB u dont have to adopt cookie god s style we love your vedios just the way it is  By the way bedrock farm is great
my brain is not braining
Super work I love all of your videos
may be you should change the title to bedrock factory
You are the second person to be found. It is a person named Ali Asal. Youtube Fars is Iranian.
sb so that you know you are the best
IVE BEEN SAYING HE WOULD DOWNGRADE FOREVER.
Why did SB use unbreaking 2 on his elytra and not unbreaking 3?
WOW! SB this is the coolest build i have ever seen someone build btw love your videos!!
Under 1 hour gang  👇🏿
YoooOoOoOoOoOooOoOooOooOooOoOoO LLlLlLllEeeEeEEEeeTtTttTtTssSsSsSsS GggGgGgOoOoOoO
Cookiegod make a bedrock factory
That redstone torch thing was so random 😂
Told you I'd watch it as soon as I could. Honestly, I'm amazed that you were able to do that. You've earned my congratulations, SB737.
This is easily the best hardcore Minecraft creator
Dam this is a mega banger dude
That factory idea was taken from acookiegod
Just crazy SB, great video mate
This is INSANE!!!
Sb has really entered his inner minecraft hardcore youtuber❤  love your content man keep it up!
SB7737 HAS JUST USED 100% OF HIS BRAIN TO BUILD THE FARM GENIUS 🥶🥶🥶
I am pretty sur that sb mentioned before that he does not want to have to downgrade the world again... But why not! This man is a legend!
SB should join hermitcraft
wait what
No1 ever said it I think, but the background music is so underrated
Build a giant medieval town with a huge castle
I enjoyed the editing in this video :)
Cool
Yo I am new, loving the videos. Keep it up.
Fun fact: the title was about bedrock etc so technically SB going past 7100 days is legal in this episode
This farm is insane. If you wanted to make it slightly more automatic, you could probably create a macro for it. You'd just have to keep watch to make sure you dont die
1 hour group
Go for 10000 days before 2024!
If you use chink save stating on a naturally generating chest, would it reset the chest and the loot in it?
Damn this is actually crazy, learning all this stuff for a video is unreal. This vid deserves to blow up
I thought it would be a long video
My head when you were removing the snow with your spade 😂😂
Gg
But that is illegal ☠️
Hey hers a tip sb Build a rubix cube in ur hardcore world😊
For who don't know the bedrock block is easly obtainable in bedrock edition in 1.20
Cookiegod farme besign
Coolest farm ever
Who would have thought that SB'S Hardcore world would go in this direction 🤔 Totally Mind Blowing 😮
Amazing man. I love your channel and series. GG
Sb try to replicate @acookiegod factory design
I don't know if he is dedicated or doesn't touch grass😂
For the algorithm
So much brain power 😵
Today is a good day coz this man uploaded
i thought he was building bedrock version farm😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That is so cool
You cant help to feel bad for Sb sometimes, he spends so much time for these quality videos just to get barely a mil views. Either way, I'd still watch his videos with a smile :)
First hour gang
when's eima majolum coming to play?
SB737 at 2023 (today): builds a bedrock farm SB737 at 2069: Builds an infinite netherite block farm and infinite god apples farm
I love the industrial theme and the building, build more of that nice things!
Now do falling block
Pov: missclicks in his house
SB = Minecraft hardcore God
Wow
bro... next he will get the air block
Quality content at its finest.
Fuckin beauty of a vid mate  Congrats from Australia
Did you steal the factory design for cookie?
Sb I still think Dezro deserves a raise This vid was piece of art. You are TRULY a legend and I hope your team grows even better. :)
SB it would look really cool if you made the beacons down a block so u couldn’t see the red glass and the bedrock was on the floor
what happened to no glitches ?
next step: geting a command block in hardcore minecraft
good, quality content. sb isnt pregnant, but he always delivers
I love the water part :)
I lile the new video stlye where you don't rush it to pump out a 100 days every week
THE GOAT HAS UPLOADED

One hour gang

Make a shrine for the editors and a museum with all your old items at 10K days
El rich made a bedrock farm that also produce other illegal block and like 64 bedrock every minutes
7:20 ????
When is the next Friend or Foe video
Best Hard Worker Youtuber I Ever Seen❤
11:25 i'm honest, it's the biggest and the best factory that i've ever seen in minecraft!
I like how you didn't do the 100 days format and just did  a regular video but still put the day counter in for people who want it. You put so much time and effort into these videos and it really shows keep up the good work my friend
I’ve seen things like this one multiplayer servers, but never on single player. Good job!
This Video Is Made For The Haters Who Says "Minecraft Is Children's Game" Love You SB 😍❤❤❤❤
Here before 20 minutes
SB737 You should watch the episode of ilegal blocks of elrichmc survival
4:20 great job sb great job
Wow never fail to amaze me❤
I love the editing style of this new video
Does bedrock have stats like bedrock placed?
cookiegod 2 or was the factory idea his own
✋
SB has no limit
Sb making minecraft in Minecraft  Imagin
Damn , Surviving almost 10K days in hardcore is very difficult. I can't even survive an hour lol ;-;
wut? illegal farm? lol
Legend
Never clicked so fast
roblox tycoon 💀
in his next video he should repair his end bace and put the bedrock where his missing end gateways are.
Hi SB737
how did people think of this
that factory was 100% inspired by ACookieGod
❤🔥 best mc player
😊😊😊😊
😮
So good of a video
WTF ☠️☠️☠️☠️😭😭😭😭
You can’t name a block that sb can’t get
The only farm he didn't build was a farm to auto sign his posters
why does he have diamond armor ?
I watched this while repeatedly muttering “this is mental” lol
This guy is insanely good at this game keep going Daniel your are the best😊
LOVE ur videos  LOve from India
IS it impossible!
Sb: uploads a 100 days every 1 - 3 weeks  Me: cant upload a short in 4 months
This video gets me more confused than 10 years of school
This is honestly the coolest thing I have ever seen. Really enjoy the new style of content from an on th main channel!
Give coecie credit bro u stole his hole idea of a factory
Claim your 1 hour ticktest here🎉
sb has got the best fanbase ever. he deserves it too bc look at this!!
Thanks for your amazing videos SB!! I love the series
And that, ladies and gentlemen is how SB737 became a peasant
Bro is smarter than Dream 💀
Love your videos
So your still in 1.20
This factory reminds me of a old prison server I played on , it’s shut down now , thanks for reminding me of that 😢😮❤
Thank you brother  Love you ❤
I only have 1 more question in life: Whats next? what could he possibly do in his hardcore world which is more than 2 years old now? He has built the most difficult farms which some wouldn’t be able to build and most didn’t even know about. He is the only true Minecraft god.
Now he has to manage to get a barrier
As a MCPE player, I’ve had access to Minecraft Bedrock this whole time
Bro pushed minecraft to its extreeme limit.
One of my favorite hardcore vids yet! You are awesome!!
1hour club!
No way
🤚
Insane man
great video
This is an incredible video it’s defiantly worth no upload in a couple weeks
it was worth the wait
SB737 when he gets to like 15000days, “ I obtained the void block in Minecraft”
You didn't downgrade because  the totam has the same texture that it has in 1.18 and also the cakes have the same texture that they have in 1.18 cakes in totems look way different in 1.12 than 1.18
Early😊😊😊
Wow, SB! How have your builds improved so much!? I remember you putting that glass and lava thing everywhere, but now your builds have become so much better!
the day count could be bigger
Sb737 somehow manages to surprise me every new video love it amazing builds SB
اني كلشي ما مفتهم بس مستمتع ❤
I had seen the prototech server video about this atleast 20 times but it was obviously difficult to understand. Now after your explanation I can definitely say that I have understood atleast the basics of it
Bro is legend
It’s always a great day when SB uploads a video!! Love you bro!❤
SB friend or foe episode
How tho...
The FBI is now knocking SB's door😂😂
Your my favorite youtuber
Guys We need to motivate SB. Like the Video and show him Love! Love His efforts toward his content 🖤
you are so amazing, you deserve even more subs than mr beast
I like bedrock but
I’m sorry but I find navynexus bedrock farm more impressive (on bedrock) it’s fully auto and reliable and really quick
Bro is so good at minecraft he oversmarted mojang💀💀💀
Think u forgot to put the day count in the title
No wayyy
can you make an up data to  bedrock market place and make the 10000 day poster cheaper Ps: i am use my sister account
e
you inspire me i love your vids😀 you started 2 years ago and look at you now LOL🤣🤣
You should keep all the armour and tools you used for this journey in a special room in the bedrock factory (nice cookie inspired build btw)
9:23 this made me laugh
its actually mind-blowing how sb can do all of this, keep up the good work!
SB, Im from Spain and in my english class my teacher and classmates said my i have a very good pronunciation.              and all this is for your help THANK YOU SB
Before 1 hour gang 👇
He went over time
This is really cool and I kinda want to make it in my friends survival server but it can’t be downgraded sadly😢
Let's appreciate the effort SB put into this
would you like to buy my champ dragon helmet on your server?
omg
SB737 Einstein is Albert Einstein's brother
how much iq this guys has??????? its insane.
wdym you can just buy bedrock for 20-30 dollar🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠
Next farm faling blocks opten command blocks
At this point in time, If you see thumbnails like these you better know it's only SB who can actually do something like this in reality. 😂
Claim your 1 hour ticket here
took a bit of inspiration from the cookie god xD
Did you know you can stack enchanted totems
Editing was top notch❤️
for smarter not harder 🤣
Sb, bedrock? Really? You are insane! (Also please backup your world about 7 times before downgrading your world its worrying me lol)
Yea I have been waiting for this
Hey SB! I'm not gonna lie I haven't watched your channel in a long while, but i think i will just start from here and keep going!
Could of used campfires for the chimneys because you know factorys have smoke coming out of the chimney
We peasants: Trying our best to reduce the lag. SB737: Makes a machine which artificially generates lag.
Everyone and Mojang says it's impossible for bedrock to obtain but not for SB737...
How to make bedrock farm
So when you dumb down all the complicated stuff it's basically just "Game breaking glitch resets thingy and reloads thingy and then you do it again for more thingys with big thingy that game can't hold" have I dumbed it down good enough? probably not but it works for my brain
16:34 The correct version is 1.12 instead of 1.2
Really impressed with this video, the previous x days I was struggling to find the motivation to click, this I had to bite my tongue to finish the video I was currently watching to stop myself from clicking! have an amazing day (you too editors)
lol
Sb737 is probably the only person to build a bedrock farm
Are you still uploading friend ore foe
Can you make a video about how to make a bed rock farm block by block
Can you make a video about how to make a bed rock farm block by block
bro needs an episode called destroying  every dessert in my world for sand
Whene frent or foe
Hi SB This is an amazing video glad your enjoying YouTube again 😀😀
5 like
i guess cooked chicken will be your new diet eh
Down grades again lol
Hi!
Couldn't you use the chunk not saving to dupe? I'm confused about it
Elrichmc do this way more faster and better than this farm
Ep 6 of asking for a world download
Keep up the good work SB!
Ty for SB because hes made i knows more about minecraft^.^
Imagine what the game devs would be thinking watching this. We designed a game where players can mine, farm, and kill a dragon. SB totally broke this idea 😂 and created this monstrosity that defies all laws.
this is why i love sb737
next time he’ll find a way to turn on the portal at the ancient city 😂😂
aint no way bro did that 💀
Can't us not for SB he is the best♥️
2.7kth comment

Yoo
Here comes the "let's Appreciate" comments
The editing in this video goes crazy 🔥
Let's go
If u love sb's videos like this comment
I love your video
One hour gang 👇👇
my question is how
UNDER 30 MINUTE GANG=COMMENT+LIKE
From what I know, downgrading the world is actually really risky(which you very obviously know) So maybe next time you get an illegal item you can do what kolanii did for his unobtainables museum and get items from other world into nether and transfer them between worlds? Plus I'm really missing the 50min+ videos coz this was more than 100 days and still just 30min...
11l vieuws in 15 minutes wow
Bedrock farm is cool   But where is friend or foe
I commented on his tweet about being the first like, I forgot the leave a comment here first😢
Epic!
You dont need to hope we enjoy a video every your vidio is special
One day my will be also viral
yooo SB will you ever you SB sundays again?
This is just pure insanity . Good job man!
FINALLYYY
Not even 15 minutes in and his comment section are already getting botted...  SB can you do something about it?
rock farm
Been waiting all day for this
finally SB737 obtaining the illegal blocks
I love how SB tries something new like the small "cut scenes" or the title. This man will be unstoppable. I actually like how he explained how the mechanism works before making it

It's illegal to be this early
Nothing
Next farm: Reinforced Deepslate Farm after that: End Portal Frames Farm after that: Mob spawners
Petition for Sb to make a totourial on how to build a Factory  👇
My heart when sb downgrades his world  ‘’Oh God”

@Spoke
Love your channel, I've been a huge fan since I was 8
Mojang: "Bedrock isnt meant to be obtained or even automated." SB: "You cant tell me what to do!"
What happened to your ultimate armor?
like the comment if you live sb737

Hi
I hope you guys enjoy the video. I know there's a few things different from every previous Hardcore episode. But I worked really hard on this, and my editor Dezro also worked really hard on it, and I am extremely proud of the finished product. And as long as I upload videos that I'm proud of, and ones that I feel have had the proper time and research put in (and not been rushed!), then I am happy :)  Also all credits and info is in the description, might make a tutorial for this on my SB737+ channel with a world download and schematics if you guys want it :)
