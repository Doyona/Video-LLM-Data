Whos a good boi
damn Ken has changed so much
How do you get a legendary card when you are lvl 8 king chest
Ghh
song at 10:58, 11:57?
W name
sped
0:20  kfc: 3 hundred captions: 3 thousand
Or remember at the start of clash prince was first arena
MINER IN ARENA 4?????
Haiche Pee
8:00 YOU JUST GOT COCONUT MALLED
So u were using minor???
You come up with the best ideas for videos
6:50 imagine you have a baby dragon ready to upgrade. Go in for a game accidentally forgetting your baby dragon upgrade. This happens. That would be an unpleasant experience.
i got prince in arena 4 because i unlocked it a a few years ago when it still was in early arena
why does everyone forget that you can unlock prince from the tutorial?
7:44 lmfao
3:44 spell valley? More like hell valley
In de begin you se 300 but you type 3000
Steel deez nuts got me dying on the flour
We love all the people
930st comment
0:40 Prince used to be at a much lower arena but was moved upwards a year or so ago for theming reasons.
0:19 oh ok you just reach 3000 tropies the video was cool bie 🤣🤣🤣 3:21 "nerf miner" stop it man 🤣🤣🤣
Only win conditions. It'll give you hell
Your name should have been KFCopy
7:34 this is just daily life for me
You had a spell in the last game being barb barrel And he had 2 spells goblin barrel and arrows
Error in beginning 300 instead of 3000
U got my luck bro im on arena 12 and and out of all legendarys i get miner all the time
wasnt prince in arena 2 ?
Now you know my pain I’m at 6k trophies and with level 12 cards some level 11 and only a handful at 13 I play against maxed out players and sometimes I tilt like 200 trophies 💀
11:00  KFC "Please"  subtitles "I don't have a spell"
i’ve watched 5 of these brand new account videos in a row and EVERY single time his first legendary is a miner
11:00 what he says “PLEASE” what the subtitles say “i dont have a spell”
It took me 3 months to master one deck and those 3 months were in Royal Arena
10:47 that game prolly got on tv Royale
bro got to 3k crowns in just a day by using copied decks, yet I've been playing for a week straight and only have 1.5k crowns
okay but like miner isnt bad, if you play him right he is an excellent mini tank with no still period, miner plus skeletons (not skarmy) takes out a megaknight for a 3 elixer gain, and if you use him to protect a defence card to let it connect to tower more it can be devastating to the opponent
eshay
6:49 opponent probably uninstalled cr
Cant you get Prince like really early on?
10:56, well, Barbarian Barrel is a spell.
KFCOPY
This is why I spam party 1v1 before an actual match
The first legendary I got was miner and I got it five times in a row and btw 4 of those 5 times I could’ve unlocked other legends
“I don’t like boys OK guys I like… men”    -KFC clash 2022  -every mega knight user
0:20 subtitle says 3000 lol
Get to your usual quota with only troops with at least 3 syllables in their names. I can tell that would be interesting. And for a bonus see if you can get a full deck of legendary cards afterwards with the same restriction
if u think they're overleved, then u havent seen me                           arena 5 with lvl 11 baby dragon and lvl 8 battle healer at king lvl 9 you can see for yourself on royal api my username is Muz Heppelwhite and my player tag is #2V0V8UYCP
i got prince to lvl 11 in arena 3, unfair advantage? yes
11:10 idk know he has a spell either the enemy:literaly just trow goblin barrel
I used my opponent to destroy my opponent
KFC your a pro at the game the o theres are stuck in the arenas for weeks so they upgrade their cards🤓🤓🤓 (edit): I’m bad at clash royel🥲🥹
ye
i think they all had prince since in the early days he was unlocked in arena 1
Pass royals is broken. I’m in arena 7 and have level 12 baby dragon
i litterally always get minner even in arena 12 lol
Said 300 write 3000
Can you try clash royale but only upgrading 1 cards per arena
Bro just give me one account form ur collection 😂
I remember I was playing in Pekkas playhouse and I fucking giant cycled him 💀
a
0:07 the way he says it so casually
8:28 yeah i had a guy with half 12 half 11 against my 7-9 on my mini in jungle arena
Bella ciccio, ti seguo da quando sono tutti counter
I’m arena 6 on my second account but all my cards are level eleven or twelve IABOT2
Do a challenge where you can only use cards of a certain rarity
The only way I could get prince in the lower arenas is if u played the game back in 2016, got it from epic Sunday or got it from a clan trade
The Background music ist from Pokemon Sun and Moon
I got a legendary from I think a gold chest
I just created a new acct 2.5 weeks ago and my goal was to get to spookytown (arena 12) by the end of the first day which I did in 2019, I didn't realize how different it's become trying to push early ladder, so I was only able to get to arena 9 on the first day as a level 6, I SWEAR TO GOD, THE ONLY CARD PPL AT ARENA 8-12 IS THE DAM MEGAKNIGHT, AND GOBLIN BARREL, that's literally all I fought, thankfully I'm a pekka player and I got to arena 10 with 0 losses, after that I started having a little bit of trouble, but finally got to spookytown as a lvl 7, then idk why but it got a lot easier to push and now I'm lvl 8 at almost 5000 trophies
https://youtu.be/pzL9tVSUE00
You merely adopted the "getting beaten by overleveled players". I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the fair matchups until I was already a master player.                       -Bane from batman
Nerf miner
lmfao i have 6k trophies and i have lvl 12 cards and some guys at 3k trophies had them
Geega chad
You didnt even credit brad for the idea..
I can’t be the only one that realized it said 3000 trophies instead of 300
Few years ago u could get prince very early
It is funny to see him unlocking Miner every single time.... Cuz i play this game since 2018 have 7 maxed out legendaries and i dont have miner
Pass port boy
Slowest deck?
Could u play on my account
"i dont understand why i always get miner" maybe thats the only unlocked legendary in spell valley
0:19 3000 trophies
Video idea no splash cards
idea: you can only use the 8 cards you most recently unlocked/collected.  (that way if you unlock miner at arena 11, you have to put it in the deck and take out the one that's been in there the longest.)
idea: you could do one where every time you enter a rena arena, you have to pick one card from that arena and you can only use that card from it. (this includes training camp, but you can use the other cards you didn't pick until you can replace them.)
Why does he look so dead inside at the start of every video lmao...
Try to play clash but only swamys
Me mini peka is level 9 but im in arena 15
W
3k trophies w only spells?
How about getting to 4k trophies with no win condition?
The reason a lot of players have prince, witch, baby dragon and skarmy is because they played and got the cards before supercell removed the guaranteed epic inside the chest when doing the training grounds.
Love your videos. I think that doing most expensive deck was super entertaining
you should beat clash royal with only the cards in a arena
Only lv 12? Weak i fight a guy with lv 14 goblin barrel
Hehehaha
Idea: Beating youtube by copying my own thumbnail.
i like teens
hey, how do you create that many accompts???
Hes starting to look like a dad
0:19 you say 300 trophies exactly but the words say 3000
Intro makes me uncomfortable
Double pekka 😳😳😳😳
Just relized he does blink during the intro
0:20 300 trophies in he writes 3000
12:04 Me when I put egiant, ebarbs, mega knight, or hog rider in my deck.
"What Kind of boys do u like?" "I dont like boys u guys.I like men"
Prince used be In the very first arena with baby d skarmey and gob barell
Great vid! Love these challenges! Maybe try this with win conditions only? But you could include like pekka and mega knight?
11:00 he says <<please>> but subtitles go <<i dont have a spell>> nice translator dude
I really love these challenges, and watch every one, maybe try it with skeletons only? But it will take a while to get to a full skeleton deck so idk? Love the vid!
You could get prince in the early game before the update guess they haven't played for a while and just forgot about clash Royale then came back so that's how they have prince
geega chad
3:16
I feel validated in a way knowing that the low arenas were obscenely overleveled for you too. As someone with multiple mini accounts, I was surprised to see how many games I was losing down there considering the fact that I normally sit at 5.3k and can push pretty quickly. It was pretty much solely due to Lvl 11 Baby Dragon, Mini PEKKA, and Goblin Barrels + an opponent who was at least 2 levels above me at all times. Everyone jokes about Midladder but Bottom Ladder is its own form of Hell for people who don't take time to grind.
hay quá Phúc ơi, nổi cả da gà luôn nè, thấm vào từng mạch máu
It took me 5 month to get to Pekkas play house
4:24 should've pushed to royal arena first, before unlocking the legendary chest
3:48 4 days and 20 hours lol
"so i started this account named stealdeeznuts"
Spent 5000 dollars to 4k
https://youtube.com/channel/UCEj7mZ6tKKyZsL5tSvrDc8Q
Ah, the double P.E.K.K.A., the best deck
I am so curious why didnt he show clips of Pekkas playhouse??
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Kfc: miner is a joke Me: miner is my main win condition

7:41 colettesimp69 just subscribed... oh no (Brawl Stars players will get it, I guess)
Me who got prince in training camp now buying it:
Aren’t there a lot of bots in the early arenas that basically have pre set decks?
Day in the life of a magic archer player?

Trust me these Higher level players have only one skill  that is their card level

Er ist BastiGHG aber in Clash Royale

Could you put a track list of all the music you use? Its very good.
Sry, I am 20 years old, unfortunately I am disabled, I live with my parents. I never had friends in real life, as well as relationships, I spent my whole life on the Internet.

Stop doing these challenges while smurfing bruh, do it on your main if u have the balls. Its just not interesting cuz the skill level is too huge
Pulchritudinous
when you want to copy someones deck  that one missing card
The Skeleton Army card is unlocked from the Bone Pit (Arena 2). It spawns 15 single-target, melee Skeletons with very low hitpoints and low damage, with an overall extremely high damage per second. A Skeleton Army card costs 3 Elixir to deploy.  Strategy  History  The Skeleton Army was released with Clash Royale's soft launch on 4/1/16. On 19/2/16, a Balance Update increased the Skeletons' hitpoints and damage by 11%. On 18/5/16, a Balance Update increased the Skeletons' hitpoints and damage by 5%. On 4/7/16, the Tournaments Update increased the number of Skeletons spawned to 21 (from 20). Clash Royale said that the fourth Skeleton from the Skeletons (the Skeletons card now only deploys three Skeletons) card joined the Skeleton Army, making it from 20 to 21. This newly joined Skeleton was named "Ledoot", according to the updated description. This was a nod to a popular meme, the Skull Trumpet. This was a bit of an odd name, as all of the other skeletons' names ended with the letters "-ry". The spawning pattern also got compressed when the card is deployed by the river. Previously, the Skeletons would spawn on top of the river, even in enemy territory. On 20/10/16, a Balance Update decreased the Skeleton Army's Elixir cost to 3 (from 4), increased the Skeletons' levels by 5 (to match the tournament standard) and reduced the number of Skeletons spawned to 16 (from 21). On 1/11/16, the November 2016 Update removed the word "Ledoot" from its description. On 23/1/17, a Balance Update decreased the number of Skeletons spawned to 15 (from 16). On 19/4/17, a Balance Update decreased the number of Skeletons spawned to 14 (from 15). On 1/10/18, a Balance Update increased the number of Skeletons spawned to 15 (from 14). On 15/4/19, the Trophy Road Update added an extra Star Level. On 27/10/21, the 2021 Quarter 3 Update increased the level cap of all cards to 14 (from 13).
the live was so fun
their card level are up because of mastery. after completing the gold challenge we get challenge  challenge to deal damae if  we complete it we get more cards of the card that damage challenge we complete
The prince thing is because prince used to be arena 1 card I got prince in arena 1 and it was moved up because it did too much damage and like no counters in first arena
YOU'RE A LEGEND ALREADY
Hmmmm all mid ladder players do this anyway 😂
0:20 3000 trophies in 43 minutes....? hello editor?
Hate fucking ads
Man I'm stuck at bottom ladder at level 10 facing LVL 11-12 with much higher level cards every single match it seems. Highest I made it was 5200 and then lost literally all my trophies after that 😭😭
Great video
1:20 Illegal interaction 💀
I think it might be nice if the clash royal screen was bigger and your face smaller but maybe that’s just my opinion
“Named my account stealdeeznuts and started pushing” 🤣🤣🤣 you suspicious suspect
I literally faced you in arena 9 lmao and lost
SeeOk?
It’s always miner cause that’s the only legendary unlocked at that range. Then princess comes soon after. That’s why it’s always the same
i see you kfc with the quick fire upload
My friend has a level 12 mega knight in arena 5 ( he traded for it)
Beating Clash Royale but everytime i get a new card i have to put it in my deck
Maybe you should try to randomize your deck every game
I was in the stream:D
WOW I didn’t know that Andrew Garfield plays clash Royale🤩🤩🤩
Your views are recently touching sky dude 💙
Can you try towers targeting troop only
How did you upload a video like 1 day ago sheesh congrats to you
Love watching these live 🥰🥰 & the video is still insane for me, perfect recap 👌🏼
we need to get this man to 500K
I came up with an idea that I thought would be a cool challenge. Half deck challenge. Pick 2 classic decks and choose 4 cards from each to make 1 deck
wow uploading somewhat like daily?
Btw people with Prince in lower levels probably played the game before it was changes
My question is how many emails does he have to create so many accounts
Only use the cards troops and get to 3000 trophies
7:33 try versing full maxed deck with only level 10-11 cards
That Pokemon soundtrack
KFC's face in the opening pretty much sums everything up
omg daily upload 0:
You should have gotten to Royal arena then opened the legendary chest because it gives a good chance at giving mega knight and it worked for my brother
People out here in arena 7 with higher level cards than me at 5000 trophies
The end 💀
Me who got 12k gold just for mastery: Business is BOOMIN
is rel?👶🏿👶🏿👶🏿
12:01 I'd don't like boys. I like men.
Your bored arnt you
2 in a row? It's an Easter miracle!
those people who got a prince is because they are old players
Me who just pushed from spooky town to arena 15 in one day after being hard stuck
Fuck this game
Ayo kfc you good you sounded a-little depressed in this Vid
Nice video
Speedrun clash Royale and you can do it your style
At 0:19 it says "3000 trophies"  I wish it was that easy
Hey, just wanted to let you know that in low arenas people have prince because it used to be unlocked in training camp. Just a heads up!
Clash Royale but you can only use your highest rarity cards!!!😂😂😂
BRO WTF he beat the dude with the highest ever trophies it could just be somone trying to impersonate him but go to 3:07 slow it down to 0.25 and pause at 3:08 look at his enemy then go to oj's vid called "1# player with wolrd record" and his name is "loulou" idk how i caught that watching in normal speed ig i just have a quick eye
Nerf miner 😅
Another KFC video already? Goated
New idea: Beating clash royale in 2-5 hours
whats that playlist?
god i love these videos so much :D
Bruh how is it that my best cards are lvl 12 in CHALLENGER 2 when these kids have lvl 12 cards in JUNGLE ARENA, just makes me so mad to see people with over leveled cards
12:01
"I don't have a spell" Barb Barrel: 😐
669th comment lol 😂
I got a challenge for you Clash royale Nuzlocke challenge when you lose your princess tower, you lose it for good for the entire grind (you'll be force to purposely forfeit the princess tower during each game if it happens) When you lose your king tower, it's game over good luck
Ok so I got the 666th comment...
Get to 4k by having to use troops that are more meta than ur other one
Two uploads in a row, mate!!!

"Beating clash royale by using only mega knight decks"
Kfc grinding rn. Try playing only common cards

Maybe try only splash damage troops

The start of the video caught me off guard😂

The best way to get cards is if you have any legendary trade tokens, on your other account give meganight for miner and on your challenge account accept it
Giga czad
Yo didn’t b rad do this’
What if you only did the random option
Imposter
i have level 14 goblin barrel in electro valley lmao
There's no way. I not expecting that to happen 2 Videos B2B, You on fire dude
older players from before the season pass got the prince on the very first arena. I personally got it from there
Wow what a nice deck you have  After the game : that’s mine now
Yessir
Next challenge should be getting to 4k trophies with only common or rare cards
I just got to areana 14
I like men😎😎😎
WOOOOOW, did u start a brand new account…
Nice video bri
11:00 KFC: PLEEASSEE! Caption: "i dont have a spell"
I think your one of the best cr yt as of rn.  You and sirtag are 👌
I don't like boys either. I like gigachads and sigmas.
Love how u come up with new contents
on a stack
Was this challenge harder then random Decks?
What if you tried reaching 4k with spells only, or ground targeting only, or melee only, or using only a certain amount of cards in a deck like not being allowed to use 8th card slot
KFC if you see this please make a video on tips on how to get good at the game I am stuck at royal arena
Low ladder getting mid ladder card lvls, ya love to see it man, love to see it
From 5k to 4k and now to 3k
STOP    STARTING    NEW    CLASH     ROYALE    ACCOUNTS
I was watching stream when this happened
Love your vids, keep it up
0:19 3000?lol (:
Clash Royale but you have to use decks from tv royale on your arena
Congrats on winning KFC 🎉
Steal this nuts hahahahahahaha funny name
woah i was not prepared to have this much content
Something is happening to KFC. This is off, 2 uploads in 1 week 😮. I like it but bring us the real KFC back
KFC is probably the only person to have completed the tutorial so many times
bro makes a new account for every video
Next get to 4000 trophies and use only sexy females
video idea: your viewers choose the cards for you every game
Wait clone in frozen peak?
Get to 4k trophies but you spend no money like a normal player f2p
When mastery came into the game I was in arena 13 and I can barely win a game so I’m just stuck playing against over leveled cards and I have no gold lmao
I just wanna know how many different email addresses KFC has
2 VIDEOS IN A ROW??? bro take it chill bruhhhh. but fr cool vid.
Who were the 6 viewers watching you in the training matches
That outro was something lmao
Hey there
These videos are just a huge showcase how of this game is full of over leveled players and unbalancedness
Perfect ending
BACK TO BACK VIDEOS????
Was in the stream as per usual  Clash royal but i must only use cards from the arena
Lost opportunity to name the account: KFCopy
The beard’s coming along nicely 🧔‍♀️🧔‍♀️
Finally early to one of KFC’s challenge videos 😁
Yes!!! This is like one of the only Youtuber's uploads I actually care about. Keep it coming!
I got prince in shop for free on my current acc and when i had the game a while ago  you could get prince in the lower arenas
2 videos in 2 days 👑
2 videos in a few days?? Is this a dream???
Lol
Do Clash Royale but you can only use cards with 3 elixir
U won’t pin this     Remove miner   Don’t use code KFC    Don’t subscribe
Deez am I right
niceee
super funny
Hi again
crazy how i was watching the stream then saw this
Whenever I lose a game:
Nice beard bro
Beast name every
cool idea for a vid
Every time i see beating clash royale in a video titel i know it Will be an awsome video
video idea: beat clash royale but everytime you unlock a card you need to use it.
why does this nigga think getting to 3000 is beating the game 🤔
Maybe you could try to get to 4k with only using air troops. Would definitely be a cool challenge
are we not going to talk about that last game?
Yessir
I got a champion from the crown chest
e giant loving this challenge
KFC clash deserves 1mil
NERF MINER
Dababy
what an amazing username
Imagine how many accounts kfc got
Do u even have a main?
7:33 oh dear KFC YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH WE UNDERSTAND THAT HOW MUCH OF A TORTURE IT IS TO PLAY AGAINST OVERLEVELED CARDS.
3:19 "of course its miner" *"god dammit nerf miner"*
omg this must be a blessing, 2 kfc vids in 2 days
lets go another video!
New challange: Playing troops,spells and Buildings that cant attack any air troops
pog
I also like men like you 🙂
11:53 DAB
Cool
Quality content, love to see this mans face pop up in my recommended videos 🙃
yep masteries are insane for card leveling, people will usually have either level 8 cards or level 10 cards because level 9 is when they can get 100 of that card for a quest.
Bro this man can win like this I struggle to win with anything
did anyone ever mention how goood his naming sense is or is it just too obvious
You grew a beard haven't seen you upload for a long time
your so entertaining
Great vid KFC!
Can you reach hog mountain with only medium speed troops
Duck
next name kizma
TriHard my deck now!
Do "Clash Royal but you only use medium elixer cards" Elixer goes throught 1-9 so you can only use cards with an elixer cost of 4, 5, 6. I think it would be interesting for the twists it has. or  Do " Clash Royal but you only use chats cards" The chat gives you their decks and you use them you would try to get to 5000 trophies.
7:33 yea no, I DEFINITELY don't understand that pain, not at all
hey KFC is level 12 goblin barrel in builders workshop op?
Rip kfc
3000? Why not 4k?
The reason people are overleveled is because clan wars is insane
Use troops that only target ground
Maybe it’s only me but it feels like you are milking this series. Find some different content bro
We have all done this befor
Outro was perfect
YEA I have lightning and hog and zap prince etc on my 300 trophy account
8:00, U JUST GOT COCONUT MAULED
Me whenever I lose in a challenge to electro giant
308
my god this is getting to repetitive the music is making me have a headache lmfao
aughhhhhhhhhhhh
everyone dont forget to smash like if breathing air
“300 trophies exactly”(the subtitles)
2 uploads within a week? Damn nice
Try beat Clash royal only using card that do splash damege
also hate facing prince on my acc where I try to be at a high arena while lvl 1  ya know... that trend long ago but still quite relevant today
KFC is ill cause he's uploaded a video within days pog
bro has beat the game 80 times
Nice name dude
KFC, you won't pin this.

Back to back? Wow 😳
