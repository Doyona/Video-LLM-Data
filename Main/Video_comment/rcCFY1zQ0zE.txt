My biggest achievement is predicting this, FDU beating Purdue and FAU going to the final four in the same bracket.
Az the all PaPer team just look like old Time UCLA title after after title until they  play in March
This is why you gotta love March madness it’s things like this the upsets
there is more to life than a grade. if you write a really goodbessay thats enough. incorporate a little bit psyvhology philosophy real history lives and there
First time I’ve been able to watch this video in full. What an offensive chokejob, we earned this loss
I was right lol
They outsmarted em 😂😂
Love seeing white dudes
When Arizona barely beat UCLA in the Pac-12 Conference Championship game, you could see them playing little to no defense at times. Same lack of effort here cost them the game and a chance to advance. Why not play defense?
I see why now Princeton are doing all this equity BS 😂😂😂 Princeton Dean: "How do we get some of that Alabama State sports money, we need some black kids" Deans assistant: "I know equity"
Princeton just had home court advantage. God bless your soul Mr. Pete Carril
Ivy League Weirdos think about it ⁉️these are the theater 🎭 Nerds running the United States 🇺🇸
lost to a bunch of scholars 🤣
If I had a nickel for every time a 15-seed from New Jersey beat a 2-seed named the Wildcats in the first round in the 2020s, I would have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but still weird that it happened twice.
whoa!
Princeton is a good team solid at every position
Why is that Purdue guard trying to score 2 when his team is down 3 with less than 20 sec left? Even if that made a little sense tbh, then he did it again later when the team down 5. This doesn't make any sense.
Arizona has lost five times in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to 13–15 seeded teams: 2023: 15 Princeton, 2 Arizona 2018: 13 Buffalo, 4 Arizona 1999: 13 Oklahoma, 4 Arizona 1993: 15 Santa Clara, 2 Arizona 1992: 14 East Tennessee State, 3 Arizona They are now the only team to have lost twice in the first round as a 2 seed.
FDU...where's Princeton?
Looks like Arizona had em beat, well into the 2nd half.
Serious choking here NCAAs tourney experienced team for AZ how much experience on Princeton none
Princeton winning a tournament game is crazy
Looks like the old school Princeton, running time off the wristwatch before searching for the intelligence play to the rim. They must  have raised the roof at Princeton Campus after that win.  Here's to the second round, let's got Tigers!!
Graduated from PU 1970. Needless to say, many fond basketball memories.
Furman, Princeton, Fairleigh Dickinson
What an upset. Anyone who likes sports underdogs and upsets should check out the us open cup. (soccer)
Tigers🐯🐅
How is this a upset
Bad Bunny and D. Booker Poppin Off https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqgtHZzCCfE
The madness of March just got real!!! Ewwwww weeee!
Always a 9 seed.  After all   It's arizona
Congrats Princeton the better team could beat AZ again tomorrow AZ overrated does this every year better alleged talent gotta be the coaching
We knew it might be a slightly open field in this year's tournament. I guess let the madness begin. This reminded me a tad of the time Princeton beat UCLA back in the day in the tournament.
Arizona was up by 12 with 22 min remaining lol unbelievable
very very embarrassing loss
Rigged
Airzona pac 12 the conference of clowns🤡
Jersey!!!!!!!
Arizona for physically being bigger in the paint was just too soft
Zona gonna be hearin about this for the next few years
That's the AZ Wildcats, who sell themselves to the world as College B.Ball U.  I've been living in Tucson for nearly 35 years and they've won just one NCAA title, as a '97 upstart. Whenever they're ranked, they break your heart.
Not bragging but I actually picked Princeton to win this game, not based on anything about them, just based on Arizona's past tournament fails 💯
Got beat by a bunch of white boys 3:30
Idk why so many idiots always pick Zona to go far. The program is the definition of origami. They always choke and are just losers. STOP PICKING THEM BEYOND THE ROUND OF 32
I had Arizona winning it all.  Go Princeton!
When Princeton big man can block a shot, run the whole flood and dunk without even being checked - you deserve to lose.
Congrats to  Princeton.
Arizona needs to start paying players again. Lloyd is getting them nowhere with second-class foreign players and a crumbling reputation as a basketball school. The last time they were relevant was 1997.
I always pick VCU to win a game or so and one year I picked them to win 3 games as an upset and they made it to the final 4 I believe. I also always pick Richmond Spiders, Gonzaga and NC State Wolfpack always to win a game or two.
I have picked a winner one year when UConn won, but that's the only year I have ever picked a winning team.
I finished filling out my brackets Thursday night avoiding all scores and games.  I started watching at around 9:55 central time. By 10pm I saw the scores and my brackets were busted because I picked Arizona to win it all! After 5 minutes everything was done for me! Completely busted!

Love the upsets. Arizona is a generational underperformer,  but this loss is epic.
tigers vs tigers Saturday
Yes I’m still mad about it
Princeton vs. Arizona? More like David vs. Goliath! 🏀🔥 #marchmadness
What an upset, Princeton trailed most the game and took a lead when it mattered the most and wins the game!
White boys shooting, dangerous in March
As a Mizzou fan, this makes me happy. I’m not underestimating Princeton though, because they could beat us too
AZ! You busted my bracket you losers! Lol. There’s always at least one of these Ivy Leaguer teams every year that do sone damage and bust brackets. They get hot, make a deep run..until they get a game where the shots don’t fall, and get beat by the team with a more athletic backcourt.
Crazy zona scored only 4 points after the 8 min mark they simply went cold down the stretch
Doesn't surprise me that both UVA and AZ were booted in the first round. It's tradition for both schools.
Kari Lake declared AZ beat Princeton and is protesting the result
I picked Princeton 😂 wow
all you need to watch if BIll walton commentary on Arizona game last game against UCLA to know early exit for Arizona is expected
How about this. Princeton is the best of the two. Probably beat them today to.
The wildcats only ever play as good as they need to and let off the gas too much. The pac 12 doesn't play enough SEC teams and other conferences that seem to play rougher. than the Pac12. The players get too used to the over officiatting style of the pac 12 and get disoriented when they play all out brawls in the tournament. Then they try to make up for it by playing rougher but end up getting into foul trouble. I think it's time to desolve the PAC12.
AZ have the worse fans In America. And a team with no class. 😂
Fun to watch. Princeton makes up for their lack of athleticism with high bball iq and fundamentals
Arizona is straight garbage. Didn’t score the last 5 minutes
i had princeton  winning since they are my hometown team and have a close relationship with the town and university. never thought this would happen
Yeah that's right...
There is no bigger satisfaction then sending a cocky team and their annoying fans back to the desert.
Mr burns voice*excellent*
Furman and Princeton didnt just upset the favorites, they upset millions of brackets nationwide. Congrats on the upsets, its what March MAdness is all about. Keep rockin it steady.
low seeeds always play smarter in upsets
did their magnets turn off
"15 seed pulls off an all time upset" said for the third year in a row
I remember when Princeton won against the defending champions UCLA in 1996. You can't sleep on this team ever. Princeton is the team you don't want to play early in this tournament. They will backcourt you to death if you let them.  Especially in this tournament.
7:29! great commentary.....
Arizona should never have a basketball program after this
Uncle phill would be proud.
Az was nervous at the end 😂 they had hella time to cook something up
Just an easy game for Princeton. Yes Arizona is trash
And there goes my bracket… sheeeeeeesh
This is what the tournament was made for..
I guess me being a Longhorns fan I'm not supposed to be laughing at other #2 seeds but 👀😭... 😐😏😄😁😂🤣 Arizona had one job and they blew it...
Props to the Ivy League, but undeniably an abysmal performance, and humongous choke by Arizona. Many Insiders and analysts had Zona as a potential championship dark horse. There's no excuse losing a game like that with such massive implications when a massive talent and athleticism disparity is on full display. After taking the lead 55-50 Arizona didn't score a single point in the final 4:45 of regulation... Let that sink in Wildcat nation. UCLA is good, potentially great, the rest of the pac12 isn't very good at all.
Arizona fan here.  Completely embarrassing.  Every loss this season has been to an unranked team.  We just love to play down to the level of our opponent.
Let's goooooooo🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
No points in the last 4:43 sec for arizonap
I swear every time Arizona is in this tournament they lose first round or win at most 1 game, and they always a high seed too.
Love to see an underdog defeat a dry team from the desert 👏 #4sUp
This game f’ed up my parlay 😂
Go Tigers!
😂 this was hilarious
I know UCLA fans r happy that Arizona lost. UCLA another Pac 12 team is a number 2 seed n won the game
😮
This game was rigged I’m just going to say that watch the full game and you’ll understand, this upset is fake, it was paid
Incredible upset
CHOOOOOOOOOKE
Ivy League!!!!!!
Only reason Arizona won in the PAC12 is the lame officials in that conference send them to the line all day.
You can smell the passion for the game....and you can SEE the lack of it in the NBA...gotta love March Madness...let's go Hoop!!!!
How much is it an upset vs the committee is horrible at seeding? Princeton did not look like at 15 seed at all
its even more amazing the Princeton team were playing holding a finacial law book in their off-hand! incredible!
すげー‼️✨✨
BWAAAHAHAHA!!! THIS IS SO HILARIOUS!!! ARIZONA LOST TO AN IVY LEAGUE 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arizona played down to a great team. They just weren't aggressive enough from the start! Princeton wanted it more
Princeton Offense still effective
Arizona got crushed in the paint against smaller guys 😅
I’d have a perfect bracket right now if Arizona could just finish this game Edit: Well Purdue and Drake Lost so I guess it didn’t matter
9:04 Luv it.
rigged
That sound you hear is the sound of everyone's bracket being busted by this upset.
Went to the game today. Place was electric.
First, to a jubilant Alocca in the post-game presser... NO! You CANNOT beat anyone. The problem with winners who benefit from dumb luck to advance is that they talk way over their ability cuz they think they need to 'ACT' like they belong there. Dude, there's you're a  reason you're a #15 seed... so that's how you need to act, not like you're about to steamroll the rest of the field. Second, to an Arizona squad who lucked out in the PAC12 Tournament Final & did the exact same thing, smug like they just blew out UCLA while the whole world saw you struggle the whole game against a superior team without PAC12 FOY & DPOY, then your guy hits the only shot he made the whole game... your guys never said a single respectful word about UCLA in their post-game presser, more concerned about 'ACTING' like they belonged in the winner's bracket. Today's loss should teach you why the winners should ALWAYS conduct themselves with humility, NOT hubris, in victory.
The way they power through "He who, uh, laughs laughs, laughs best" at 7:50 is just pure professionalism.
Dang !
Arizona, choking high seed NCAA tournaments away since 1990. Just stop accepting bids.  Maybe try D2
Arizona looked like they left the half time and said “Cancun on three” 😂
Spoiler 🛡
My bracket is in the trash now
Boy, it’s tough watching these games. Between tee shirts under jerseys, guys wearing long johns, enough tattoos to choke someone, nutty hairstyles, missed layups. Yikes 😬
It’s nice to see basketball played within the arch, which seems to have nearly become a lost art in the NBA.
And somewhere in basketballs Valhalla, Peter Carril smiles.   Princeton did it again 🐅🐅🐅
Go nerds!
Commentators called the game at 5:40 in the 2nd half!
Please don't spoiled the game highlights displaying Princeton
#11 is a big who plays like an ice cream cone
I love seeing things like this. True MM!
When you think about it this isn't too shocking cause Arizona has had these bizarre losses all year where it seems late in games they just lose all composure and can't execute anything.
Wow!
No Pity for the Kitty 🐈
Onto the Next round
Comeback
As always. Every year. Ivy League is waaaay underseeded. 🙄🙄🙄🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Terrible coaching by Arizona.
I said it on selection Sunday, and I'll say it again.....this tournament is about as ho hum as I can ever remember it being.   I used to take off work for opening Thursday and Friday's games.  This year, I didn't even turn it on until I got off work and ran some errands. After the first day, I'm already bored to sleep.  Day two insn't looking much better.  I will say that Princeton knocking off Arizona and Furman taking out Virginia were nice touches though.  Is Arizona trying to be the most choking team in a 15 seed in history?  What is this, like three times for them now? Remember kids, never bet on the Pac12.  And is Virginia officially the most overrated program in basketball history?  How many seasons are we going to keep watching this uninspired team camp out in the top 10 while eeking by their competition just to get an unreasonably high seed only to bow out early?
Who else had a perfect bracket until this game?
Lol that missed free throw at the end won me 20k on race to 60 points-bet (neither)! Let’s goo!
LeBron knew this would happen
10 from arizona aint wanna win at all
Arizona with 0 pts the last 4:41. That's a bad time to hit a cold streak.  I believe they scored 6 in the last 11:30.
Wow just wow     Bracket busted again
Texas fan here what a game congrats Princeton 👍
History repeating.  how many times in the past has Arizona gone home in the opening round of the Dance??  geez boys.
It's happening again
Zona … Looza!
Well my entire south region bracket is busted. WV lost Virginia lost UTST lost Arizona lost.
Arizona got the kiss of death from Ol' Sleepy Joe to win the championship and like everything he touches they ended up losing and failing. 😆
Bracket busted
Peacocks
One of the local (KC) sportscasters said you have to like Mizzou's odds against a 15th seed, so congratulations on getting through to the Sweet 16, Princeton.
Classic Arizona
It has begun 💪🏾🔥
This might be the worst choke i've ever seen. Up by 10 with less than 8 minutes to go. Princeton goes on a 18-4 run to finish the game. Arizonas last point came at 4:45 left in the game. They scored ZERO POINTS in the last 5 minutes of the game!
Reminds me of Yale vs Baylor a few years ago. Man, imagine going home having to say you got beat by a bunch of nerds.
They don’t even have their last names on the back of their jerseys 👍
I was there for UCLA in 1996 - this had a lot of the same vibes, minus a very loud Hoosierdome.
Arizona getting worked by a bunch of future lawyers and doctors lol
And that's how you do it.  Play like you got nothing to lose, determination.  Good hustle, great shooting, great work in the inside, great ball movement.  Old school bball always wins.
Im shocked by this game i had Arizona makeing the final four or elite 8 im was stunned by this
There goes my bracket had Bama beating Arizona
Arizona needs to get out of the pac 12… does them no favors when the tournament comes around
AZ fan here.  Such a humiliating defeat. I put the loss on the coach.  Kriisa got way too many minutes, and Ballo’s broken hand should have prompted the coach to use other players, especially Bal. He didn’t get a minute of play, yet he is one of the better 3pt shooters on the team.
The whole AZ team should give back their scholarships  !
First day bracket already gone 🤣
I wonder how they like that new coach now?  Should have kept Sean Miller.  Some universities never learn.  Look at Iowa!  Ha!  They fired Bruce Pearl years ago.  Poetic justice.
Princeton beat a 2 seed I give them props for that.  But I wasn't impressed by either team... Arizona looked like a 15 seed
I can already hear ESPN Smith and Kendrick, Princeton is racist look at all them white supremacy kids…
Somewhere in Tempe Arizona, ASU fans are happy that their rivals got ousted--GO SUN DEVILS!
New coach, same cats
Arizona is overrated & they are an average team out of the pac12 & away from their ‘homer’ court…they are also on 4 year probation TY Sean Miller the cheater…
Lol
Pompous AZ lost 😄
This is what happens, when the President picks you as the team to win the championship.
Embarrassing
They just played smarter like Ivy League school players should.
well there goes 99 % of the brackets.
Up set 😊
The 👻👻 of Lute Olsen!
I almost picked Princeton. This heavily reminds me of Kentucky from last year: a 2 seed who limped into the Big Dance, only to lose to a 15 seed. It's the only 15 i felt had a chance to upset. Luckily i only had Arizona going to round 2!
Arizona outscored 23-8 in the last 11 minutes of the game absolutely embarassing
I was watching this live and it felt like the teams flipped jerseys for the last 7 minutes. Insane game by Princeton
How does this happen bro Arizona was in my elite eight
I had them going to the sweet 16 thank god not farther
That’s why March madness is better than the nba playoffs in my opinion
What a upset, congrats to Princeton.👍
This is the 3rd straight season that a 2 seed has lost to a 15 seed
Bracket is ruined 😕🔫
Different year.....same results.....
I'm watching the highlights, see there is 10 min left in the game and think, "Wait, they are only going to score 6 more points this game?" 🤔🤨
Evidently Joe Biden is no better at picking brackets as he is running the country. He hsd Arizona winning the whole thing.
Always bet against Arizona in the tournament.  Always.
Wow!!
UofA fan and alum here. Congrats to Princeton. You were the better team and we did not show up with the intensity needed to win this game.
😂 isn’t that great!
lol
Nice
This is great
I LOVE MARCH MADNESS
#15 beating #2 three years in a row.  The parity is crazy.  Btw,  I think UNC are a bunch of chumps for not taking on the NIT.  They know there are some quality teams that didn't make the NCAA tournament who could beat them.  UNC lost my respect, fwiw.
I'm not surpirsed.  I grew up around Princtton.  Pete Carrill always upset teams in the 80's-90's.  I miss the old days of Penn, Princeton, Villanova and John Cheney Temple Owls. basketball,
You could see the disbelief on Arizona player's faces. Guys that study are beating us!
That’s just March Madness at it’s finest .  I’ll never forget that UCLA 3rd seed and Princeton 14th ( Pete Carril’s last season  ) ……  You never know how it will turn out come March . That’s why I love this time of the year .  Congratulations Princeton .
Arizona scored 6 points in the last 10 minutes. What a collapse
Believe me or not, I picked this upset based on witnessing the #2 seed Wildcats (KY) lose to the #15 seed last year. No other reason besides that unless you count the madness of March. No one really sees these upsets coming or predicts them with 100% confidence, that's the beauty of it all. Heart attacks and heartbreak go hand in hand this time of the year and I'm totally here for it. Kentucky losing in this spot last year still hurts today like it did when the buzzer sounded. I thought there's no way my 2 seeded Cats with the NPOY could or would ever lose to a 15 seed in the first round of the big dance. WRONG!! That's why this is the most exciting time of the "sports" year. Nothing compares to NCAA basketball in March, period.
Let’s go Tigers!!!
U of Ain't
I hate being an Arizona fan man
Only 8 points in the last 11 minutes.
Final 4mins Arizona didnt even score, what was just happened?? nice defense from Princeton.. Congrats Princeton  Ncaa madness upset as of today #virginiacavaliers #arizonawildcats  whose next???
gcu to elite eight
third best basketball school in az
Furman: We have the biggest upset of this year’s tourney   Princeton: Hold my thesis paper…
Hilarious
The nobody 12 loses yet again!!
Arizona is CHOKE CITY AGAIN 😅
Arizona led by 10 and were outscored 18-4 down the stretch. SAD!
is arizona still on last years dopamine?
Brackets Busted!!!!
Just never give Arizona a bid ever again
The best part about this is every Tucson fanboy needs ASU to lose tomorrow night or they’ll be on suicide watch.
I picked Princeton to win and all my friends laughed at me...
There goes my Bracket
I wish I would’ve known Joe Biden picked Arizona to win it all, he literally ruins everything 🤦🏻‍♂️ lol
What a game
U of A is sorry!!!!!
Great game
There's a whole lot of quit in that Arizona team.....and a real lack of urgency when it mattered. Overrated. Congrats.....Princeton.....You wanted it more and unlike Arizona played with a sense  of purpose. Go Tigers.
Losing to an Ivy league school who is literally just happy to be there. Gotta love March Madness
#15 Princeton will face #7 Missouri on Saturday at Sacramento
I picked Arizona to win it all….
A team that averaged over 80 points a game and was a final four pick for many people lost to a team with four white guys in the starting lineup. Congrats boys. You’re now the laughing stock of the tournament.  Virginia thanks you.  Also, Princeton didn’t even play that well overall, Arizona just literally couldn’t hit any shot they had, whether open or not
This is what happened when your governor cheated the public with her fraudulent election run.  Sorry Arizona, it's karma not your fault.
🐻🔽
LFG PRINCETON YAAAAAA BOYEEEEE
Outstanding!
Put that in your pipe and smoke it Jay.
Let the Madness begin.
I knew it was gonna be a great tournament when that Furman kid dunked on Virginia
Who bracket bust??
As usual, Arizona under performs in the tournament again.
An upset we'll remember decades from now
jersey pride!!!!!!
Furman and Princeton!!
lol @ Arizona
WHY GEORGIA WHY?
Another bracket buster
Great job Mitch Henderson
How 'bout them White boys!
I had this one on my bracket😂
Coming from a Texas Longhorns fan I’m really happy that Princeton pulled off the upset against Arizona!! I hope Princeton becomes the 4th 15 seed to make it to the sweet 16!! That would be 3 years in a row where a 15 seed makes it to the sweet 16!! I really love the underdogs!!
Congrats to the smart kids!
Hahaha @ Arizona.
March is the a top 3 month of the year
I think tbh these "centers" need to be re wired. They need to understand that being huge compared to the rest doesn't mean you cant be quick and effective. What is all this? I mean how?
Furman and now Princeton. I wanna see them both go all the way now lol
I cant believe this lol
3 straight years we have had a 15 seed a 2. Now could we make it 3 straight years where that 15 at least makes the Sweet Sixteen?
I had Arizonia in the final 4 in one of my brackets.  The beauty of March as a fan...and the pain of March as a bracket filler.
What a game by the Tigers man 🚨🫰 This is what its all about!
WHEN IT'S MARCH .. ITS MADNESS ..
Anybody else thinks all the Center-led teams will be bounced early?
PRINCETON COMEBACK!!!
