hated fifa 21 at the time but looking back at it now its nostalgic. this card would be considered terrible in fc25 but back then this card was goated
Miss this shi so much man when i had time for all this 😢❤
Fifa 21😔❤️‍🔥🔥💯🙏
Honestly it’s so sad watching how this game fell off, take me back to the og fifa.
❤❤
why do i get this video 3 years later...
man this card would be min price on the market if it was tradeable and on fc 24
This changes EVERYTHING
This being recommended to me 1 year later changes everything
Oh YouTube wants me to pack him😂
Messi flashback in FIFA 22??👀👀
Bruh, if he only knew what was coming.
Oh city in the mud 🤦‍♂️. CR6 on his way back home
You know that meme when homer simpson disappears into a bush… that was this card no cap…. But bro its july rat to glory szn2 as we speak leggo
Y’all should check out my recent vid, this cards insanely good.
this is sick but they should really make individual player models for all types of cards. make him look like the man utd ronaldo
I can do only one sbc between him And Rooney, which one should I go for?
I got it for 150 k
goncalves or him????????????
Best chemistry style on him ?
What camera settings is this please?
He is soooo fast .. I recommend him as a RW
RONALDO OR SALAH BASE ???
Man sure helps with the Tonali objective
St
Should I build Ronaldo for 150k?
Is it worth to do him i can complete him by only playing the 84 squad i can do the rest for free
I'm genuinely just away to start playing with a team I like, fuck this meta, literally have zero fun when constantly trying to sweat out wins with players i only use because of fifa stats, MU 87 CR7, baby van nistelrooy and roy keane will be my 3 main players starting from today, fuck this meta im going old school and just having some fun with it, squad battles will be a nostalgic dream at least
I'm sold
Am I the only one wondering why he’s not a Lw?
7:45 how do you do that bridge?
So easy to link too. Just use the 4-5-1 and change to whatever you want ingame and just get cuadradofor rb and thats about all the links you need
U know I have to grab him
Stick an engine on 10 chem Ronaldo, puts his balance on +10 makes him feel less clunky whilst dribbling, he also gets a fair amount of pace boost too
Jesus loves you repent before its too late...
you really need to learn knuckleball freekicks
Bro how did you do that frrekick at 5:38
Why isn't this flashback card at Man Utd? Would make it alot more fun
Totally useless, don't waste coins! Even gold Bale card is better.
I cant even afford any sbc 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Guys can somebody help me with sbc number 3?I need the cheapest way to take him
Should I buy 93 messi or flashback ronaldo?
I had my eyes on this card, looks great! Review comes in handy.
Which he looks like younger cr7 with the dyed fluffy hair and earrings
You actually said BTEC Ronaldo lol how do you know about that
am i the only one that thinks he is aircool
Gelson Martins is under 1k. There isn’t much difference
r they bringing a messi flashback out?
His stats are so low tho for an 87. He is like a 85 stat wise and fifa really fucked his weakfoot. Ronaldo has has been a 5 star weakfoot entire career... and young ronaldo had mbappe pace...
He is insane! I have him aswell
CAME CLUTCH ON FUT CHAMPIONS
i sold my top 8 players in team for ronaldo ✊🏽😅
I played against him about 15 times in champs and he score a total of 2 goals
The only difference i can see comparing to the gold card is the weak foot. Other than that i feel like its the same no 🧢
Him as a striker and dybala rm in game or dybala striker and Ronaldo rm
i still havent bought fifa 21 lol
He feels not right
Ok I got the card and the stats are completely lies they didn't want to make him to op because holy when I use him his dribbling is insane and his agility is wow and shooting 🤯

What formation and tactics did you play with?
I did him and im currently at 11 weekend league wins out of 20, mans is immaculate
Good vid
Was gonna get gold Ronaldo on Thursday. This has really made my reconsider whether it's worth spending that much on a card that other people are crafting for free. Plus the fact that he's RW works better for me than ST. Debating whether it's worth spending that much for a 4* WF.
If Messi would get one of 2012 there would have to be a 109 rating
Ronaldinho LW, Ronaldo ST, Ronaldo RW and your attack is sorted out for the rest of the year.
Damn I wish I had done that Sandro card.
Ronaldo flashback or Gold rashford at striker besides TOTY lewandoski??
is it worth selling mbappe for  ps already got ribery
If he’s a flashback Man U then put him with manu so this card can be matched with prem teams and his basic is still juventus.
Ronaldo or dybala? Quick please
I would definitely want a flashback Messi card
This is my only chance to ever play with a Ronaldo
Ngl he’s terrible for me
I already have champions league Ronaldo I packed him on the same day that I bought fifa 21 ha but I definitely still want this card anyway
CR
to be compleatly honest the only downgrade you feel in game is the weakfoot downgrade
Cristiano Jr. Future fut stars card 😂
He still has that cr7 op body type and his 3 star weak foot probably feels like a 4
Not even a young ronaldo face? ea is trash bruh
Guys Gold Rashford VS Flashback Ronaldo ?
i love this card!!!22 goals in 10 games for me
You want to use Finisher chem style for an even better experience
This sbc is a quick and dribbling style. He is top quality
He one the best cards out
im all about fun cards and i did Moments Jovic and Asensio last year had so much fun and this card brings back that feeling
Guys dont get the card if u dont have a team like his... im someone who doesnt have the best cards and well i made the mistake in getting the card and its just horrible. If u have a team with icons and stuff its usable because he has players to support him.
Stats are not to compare of a 87 rating more 84/85 rating that’s the only thing that is stupid
feels so smooth with a marksman
CR9
About to sell my Ronaldo
I have 4 attackers in my team. Rashford(85) mbappe(90) ronaldo(87) dybala(91) which formation and positions should i play these in? Trying to find a good solution
Finesse outside the box is broken on this card
Check out pes6 cr7's stats and this cr7's stats. Shoulda been better...
Wait how do you know what B-tec is😂
F in the chat for the opponent who most likely did 6 icon sbc's and got absolutely finessed indeed!
damn you're on the trending page
Gold Dembele Better card, better links. The ONLY reason you get this card is nostalgia
Am I crazy to do this if I have his 92. I just love the flashback designs.
poor man’s ronaldo
Whats a good chem style for ronaldo?
My heroooo
Should I get 93 messi or flashback ronaldo?
Great video as always, could you do a Pogba SIF Review please? :p It came out like a week ago
Turn to Jesus Christ!!
Ayy This vid is on trending  page
I think x999
hellooo guys!Who else is trying to grow their YT channel during quarantine. Let’s help one another. Much Love
I'm not a fan of the card itself, but I think EA did great with this. They gave the casuals a cheap alternative knowing that many of them don't even break 1 million coins until the end of fifa.  Plus the timing of the card was great because I literally crafted it for free with the fodders from upgrade packs
With flashback players I would love it if they made it for the main club they used to play for. Like Ronaldo for Man U would be amazing!
5:36....what in the staging hell is going on here.
If you're still playing FIFA in 2021 you deserve everything you get. Reused content, predatory micro-transactions and more.
Hope For Neymar or Messi like the concept what ea did with ronaldo
I did the sbc in both consoles don’t care about his pace or anything he’s cristiano Ronaldo
TRENDING #6 IN THE UK !!!!
Cost me 60k ...i dont care for the stats its ronaldo😍
Christiano Ronaldo
Susar Khan
If you dont know how to spend your coins then yes. If you dont have enough coins just bug dembele as he ia like 2k and has better stats
EA: -concept= excellent         -execution= garbage
tried him on my brother's account and his dribbling is unreal. his agility is next
I dont know why his shooting is 79 he had a engine in his boot when he was at united
Why is he not on Manchester United like every Ronaldo card is on juventus the only Ronald I probably will be able to afford can’t even get on my team 🤦🏽‍♂️
You think i can play him as o rightwinger? Use that pace and his stupid rebounds and bounces that he gets through with.
At first I thought it was trash but then I realised it’s not for me since i play the game lots but I have now acknowledged that there are people who get to use Ronaldo who have never used Ronaldo before
when he expires i know the people that didnt do him are going to be mad
was on a difficult streak in WL before doing him. now im on a 7 win streak its like he brings life to my team again. put deadeye or finisher on him. pace is sufficient enough
So sad they patch the step overs, with this ronaldo would be so cool
I was doing this sbc, and in the rare mixed players packed his toty
Put a Hunter on him he’s class
Would love to see Ronaldo against a proper opponent
Guys what would you say is better ronaldo or dybala cause I can only do one
I really hope we get a flashback Messi going back to his first days as a Barca player, that would be great
Lozano hl or ronaldo fb st?
I really wish there was a loan version
Compare him with lucas moura 🤣🤣
Seriously flashback Ronaldo with 91 pace is a joke....it should be 101 tbh
I need to learn how to bridge ..
I've been slagged off by you tubers pro players saying stats don't matter that much EA input different details in alot of the high mid to high players to make them perform differently in particular icoms and the players they promote within the games advertising.
How do we bridge pass a defender?
Whose better at CDM, Toty Kimmich or Toty Davis in 4231?
Ronaldo or Dybala guys ?
Can I complete with 30k all my coins
I OOONLY wish his Finising was at least 84, Nd composure 82
Is he better than gold mane??
Future baby icon
Wny not make him a UTD player? So wack
What position you play with ronaldo ??
CR7 in a SBC. You complete that
That’s CR6
I'm gone to do him
Imagine a Neymar or a Mbappe...
I wasn't going to play this weekend league then this card came out
Him striker, neymar striker or butragueno mid striker (in a 4-4-2)
Waiting on Flashback or End of era Wayne Rooney so I can make an 06-07 United squad.
Do grealish
Honestly, I think it's just your skills. I'm definitely gonna be shite with him lol
How did you hit that free kick
He looks a lot faster than his 92 card im doing him asap
Yeah I’m doing the SBC
Nick why didn’t u show the 1st goal in the first game? We want to see ur reaction to that lol cmon man.
if i didnt have his blue untradeable i would def do him hes my fav player ever siiiuuuuu
Not worth it, the stats are way to bad. Better got the real gold ronaldo
dude ima do both Messi and Ronaldos the two goats :)
Bro I have dybala politano freeze and player moments dybala and freeze Lamartine at attack do I do him or no
Used all my fodder even though I have headliners mahrez
If you have some high rated, just do it, it would be 0-100k for a Cristiano Ronaldo.
Well it’s official. My untradeable UCL CR7  is fodder and going into this flashback CR7
GUYS I JUST PACKED TOTY MESSI! OMG HE'S  A GOD SO FAR 14 GOALS IN 5 MATCHES IN FUT CHAMPIONS
If this was man utd card then it would have been great
79 shooting are you joking
If you don’t have Ronaldo do this sbc and have fun
Messi toty pls
Great concept, bad execution
That card is a winger like his days at united. People who are sour about it dont do the card just buy the gold. There’s sentimental value to this card , the origin of “ cr7”
Hes a decent card but he should have better shooting and dribbling
Imagine spending $300 on 24000 fifa points, opening 8 x jumbo rares, 5 x rare players and 2 ultimates to not get a single walkout.... Guess I used up all my luck with untradeable cards...wow ! I feel abused
Aa9skillz is a sell out he does not called ea out
Want to do it but have his 94 untradeable it's just an iconic card. Lol kinda annoying your all getting it without the luck it takes to get one I suppose it's no where near the same as the 94 or toty mine is a beast
I got ribery and he’s goated fr
I can honestly say he’s really good tbf I have him next to mbappe second game I had with him he scored 5 goals in division 4 he way better Then the flashback  Aguero card so if your thinking of getting him put a deadeye on him ✌🏼
I regret doing débala yesterday when today this comes out smh
The fact that the Dybala sbc came out at recently is perfect.
Thanks for the review Ggmu!! 🤩
I have this card its Amazing very good no difference swichrn gold and this .. believe me guys do it  dont miss🙂
I know he’s bang on average and if he was any other player I would scoff it off but it’s not so I’m gonna do him regardless
his finishing is very sus. but he is fun to play with
He is CR7, who cares if he is good or bad
4:15 not a single good icon, you have to feel for the guy
I'm not wasting 300k on an untradeable and unplayable ronaldo, I will wait until I can buy the good one.
Finally I am able to put my Neymar to LW for the 10 chem ;P
He's so OP. Damn, what a player!
Lads robben or this Ronaldo?
Don’t understand how a flashback card keep him on an Italian team that’s retarded. You should either have the choice or it should just be the team he played for in the flashback that’s so dumb how they did it
This ronaldo should be higher rated imo cause when he was on United he was unstoppable !! but eh always is even now but he was more flashy then and smarter now
I would like to do him but already got untradeable gold ronaldo
What’s his goal song?
Since this is CR7 at his United stages I think the shooting and passing is fair on the card, but I think he should have better pace and dribbling. It’s something EA will hav to Improve on in the future because when they were younger, while Messi and Ronaldo were less clinical there’s no denying they were faster and more agile when they were younger.
For those who can’t afford it right now, bang out squad battles, rivals and fut champs for the next 2 weeks and you will have your ronaldo. 100% can be done by anyone.
Should I use flashback CR7 and moments Suarez or freeze aouar and neymar?
If only he was LW... Could've just used Ron and Messi together...without spending shit tons of coins...
All you muppets moaning about price, he has the ronal do factor and literally cost less than inform ASM, If you have stuff in the club do it!
So it's possible there will be a Messi flashback (CF) position with pace boost...and will cost around 85-110k...
I completed him and he’s unreal. That Ronaldo stock is just so broken. The finishing has never been a problem for me the only downside is the passing
Cost me zero, all the players from upgrade SBCS!
What is the best chem style for him if he has 7 or 8 chem on him cuz I play him at striker in a 4-2-3-1 with Messi dybala and Felix
EA know exactly what they are doing. This is just Nostalgia and EA rinsing our clubs. That card on the face of it is no better than an Ousmane Demblele but because it is Ronaldo people will pay 250k +. We can all be guilty of it, I'm  a big Liverpool fan and I paid well over the odds for Milner.
This better be good or im un subbing lol
How would he be on 7 chem cuz I have a full prem team and just want to get him in?
Just buy Lucas moura same or better stats and he is worth 4K
When you’ve got untradeble ronaldo
The other guy can't defend That's why
How Can  you do the suuuuiiiii celebration and this skill 9:29 pls
they should have made him Man Utd player since  its a  flashback RW.... especially since Man Utd has no decent RW in the game currently/irl
They should update his hairstyle
Wtffff siiiiiuuuuuuuu
I honestly don’t understand how people dont have normal ronaldo already come on guys do better If you are as good as you say you are you should have 1.2 mill this far into the game
i think there will be a messi flashback so dont spend your fodder on him and wait for that cheeky messi
Nick is commentating like it's an advert😆
This is my only time to get a Ronaldo
Btec Loucas moura
Hopefully they do a Messi one, would be awesome
Just get you the Real cr7......not that hard to trade 1-1,2mil
Who is better to pair with dybala freeze martinez or this flashback Ronaldo?
in game i play him lw dybala rw and rashford up top with that new grealish card alejandro gomez cam and milinkovic savic as a cm as well for some defensive qualities
Sikkkkeeee , i packed normal ronaldo yesterday hehehehe
Sbc of the year
I have already got Robben. Should I still do this Ronaldo? He has always been my favorite player and I want him soooo bad
Is he better than 86 Deulofeu?
With a hunter this guy can runnnnnnn
I went to do this SBC right after this video and scored 2 goals in his debut this card is nice👍
This is a rip off sbc. Even as a Man U fan I’d do this if the card wasnt so poor for the price. There are so many other RW options, like Salah, Van Bergen, even robben is better. Cool concept, poorly executed into the game.
Put a MARKSMAN and he will have Ronaldo strength.
if you add all the all the stats the avg is a 72 rated, if you dont add up the defending hes an 80 rated... this is not good
Now everyone gonna have him for FUT champs
Ronaldo or dybala sbc??
Currently doing the SBC
Is it better if I put on him the maestro chem style or does it worth it put him deadeye? I know that you´ved used him with deadeye but, is there any difference?  I got him for 5k
5:20 yes, - 10 strength 🤣
NDL
they could have made him usable
I packed ronaldo on my main account and got transfer banned and proceeded to start a new account and missed him ever since, I might have to do this card just so I can get a small Piece of a card that carried me to div 3... I’m a high div 5- low div 4 player btw.
Baby cr7
They did him dirty on the dribbling
EA got this card so wrong  Take away some shooting and physical stats  Bump his pace and dribbling also give him a 5* weakfoot and there you go flashback ronaldo  Good idea by ea tho
What should I put on him for lw
Everyone: give CR7 five star weak foot EA: lemme just downgrade it to three star
Ronaldo got rid of that yee yee ass crybaby behavior and got that ball in the net
Seen 5 different popular player reviewers. No one describes him in the same way. Nick giving the highest grade. "It literally is a gold ronaldo"
This card or Martinez ?
Imagine doing this sbc when you just packed him from your two month saved 83x25 pack
Great concept but he’s should have better stats he’s a 83 rated RW in Futbin. EA made him bad
Great SUPER sub for mi squad
They finally had a good idea but ruined the stats
Why do this sbc then you can get the gold version  is so mutch better
Over hyping this card after a few games against shitters 😂 nick is a good player guys and he was hyped to use the card before he started so don't think you'll get the same results.
I’m gonna do him and see how he shapes up compared to his gold that I’ve used for over 160 games. Could be interesting if he plays the same... I’ll play him RF in a serie A team!
Now we need a flashback Messi card with lots of stamina and lots of dribbling and pace lol
Hmm, nice card. But cmonnnn, we need flashback Messi now, am i right?
Great sbc but imo he should've had more pace
I think he’ll feel a lot like waman silver inform but better
I already have his 92 card, should I do the sbc?
Anyone else feel like flashback player's should be at their old club? Ie Ronaldo at united where this one is presumably based around?
I am very happy that there is CR7 SBC.He is my favourite player,my idol and I dont care what are his stats-I will complete the SBC!I don't have many coins for CR7 92 overall.
Just put the finisher chem style and he’s still The 6’2 Rat 😂😂
This guy feel like his normal card but just the weakfoot is an issue, but even his weakfoot bangs goals in, plus he feels way faster, deffo recommend
He shud have the following stats  95 pace 94 dribbling 87 finish 94 shotpower
Super sub material or nah?
Nick puts the weirdest chemstyles on players. The only viable chemstyle is finisher, not deadeye.
i’m gonna hold on and not do it just in case they release a messi flashback
8:10 Fckn lingardinho’s non rare 77 rated gold card could have succeeded with that bridge right there hahah..  ur opponent did not made it hard for you in that match man. What we wanna see is if Ronaldo FB is good when push comes to shove :)
I love this because it gives a lot more players the opportunity to play with Ronaldo. I still find it weird that EA would make a card that is worse that his gold card. Maybe I just havent seen it, but I dont think this has been done before.
Ronaldo never had 79 at shooting in real life
How have ea not given him 94+ pace ?
So I heard that there are players like Messi and neymar are confirmed but not sure
base ronaldo haha
How do flashbacks work? I was thinking he was premier league.
I just bought 20$ worth of points in hopes to get enough coins to do this sbc and I packed toty ramos...
dude you’re fast
Is this the first time ever they have lowered a rating on a special card?
Ronaldo's passing was way better in MNU than these stats😣so disrespectfull from EA. 3 * weak foot proves EA employees don't watch football at all.
Really didn’t want to do this abc bcs of the 87 rating but you really forced my hand, and now I have to... off to transfer market now ✌🏼
Hes been two footed his whole career so real dumb to be downgraded, he should be 5 star his whole career
Brilliant concept, we'll done EA. Kids moaning because he's not 99 rated and 100k
Honestly....  Rashfords base gold card looks like a better card.
Ronaldo or Boateng? I already have robben
As I feared, this Ronaldo will be too broken and now everyone will have a cheap Ronaldo on their team... Not great actually
A Santos Neymar coming soon?
Better play gold Cristiano or cristiano(rw) and also buy mbappe? Coz today I bought gold Cristiano and now I'm not sure if there is any difference between them and if there is how long this rw version will be usable
Please don't make me do this SBC. 😔
Ik you’re happy rn Nick but I’m confident when you play good players in wl you’re gonna rage and say how bad the card really is.
Everyone and they're nan is going to have this friggin card. The requirements are way too easy
I’m a huge Man United fan first time I can play with Ronaldo since fifa 14. Can link with the god bruno
87 CR (280K) vs 86 Lozano (230K)?
no long sleeves Ronnie. Vintage ronaldo my ass. Same as they did with Torres 🤢
That’s CR6.... still did him though
Flashback messi is definitely coming.
He is good but compare him to robben or Martinez fit freeze
91 pace is disrespectful
I’m putting hunter on him I guess
Can’t wait for Messi flashback!🔥
Messi review?
How can I craft him?
He’s so bad
This concept is a positive one from EA, it would have been nice if they could have had this Ronaldo as a Utd played as he is a flashback SBC.
Or you just really good to make this Ronaldo feel good
FIFA 16, I see you nick...
why is there no united badge?????
He terrible he can't Kick a ball
I did him and confirm he plays way above his stats.
Resets 😁🤣😂o black
Never in his career has Ronaldo had 79 shooting and a 3 star weak foot smh. EA ruined a great concept with those stats. I’m not asking for 99 shooting but 79? For a guy who was one of the top goal scorers at right mid? Smh
Let's face it. I'm never getting gold Ronaldo. Thank god Dybala sbc is not over. Doing both now
Robben though?
Imagine if they made it like David Beckham and put him on Manchester
Kdb toty review?
Ronaldo makes 5 yard pass - "Ouuuu this card is nuts" lmao
guys it's basically rashford with 3* weak foot. So if you think rasford is solid, then go for it
I’m about to sell my squad to do this sbc, what a treat this is
doesn't really look like a "fake" Ronaldo, think you have to do him just to have in the club anyway. thanks for the crazy amount of content king, gl with the toty grind.
So where Messi at
So can you use 2 ronaldos in 1 team?
they should’ve released this 2 months ago and would’ve been a W
Do I do dybala or Ronaldo ?
Is he actually that good.... damn
If this was an objective it would be amazing, as an SBC it’s disappointing
your gameplay is actually so good for once Nick this CR7 is not the same as gold CR7 at all
If they really wanted to make a throwback ronaldo with 3* weak foot, they should've at least made him 95+ speed. He was lightning quick back in the day. Would make him more useable too.
i watch these videos for the satisfaction of nick hitting those green timed shots with different players
last year i said i want to bring messi for the first time and i did and this year i said i want to bring CR7 to my team for the first time then i saw his price was a 1M i was like shit now we have this CR7 who cost 200K
Should I do it if he doesn’t fit in my team and I don’t have the coins for him and dybala?
For me,nah,so many better players for 250k
ROKET RONNY WHAT A FOKIN FINISH
I’ve always said they should do the flashback cards with the club they played at during that time, not current clubs. It’d make these cards that much better 🤷🏻‍♂️
Is it Ron to call this overpriced?
91 speed flashback Ronaldo is very weak when you now that he is one of the fastest player ever that's insane. And another point is why he is not on man u or sporting (3 wf) 87 rated and mbappe 90. Ea at least wanted to try and it's already good. But there are too many things wrong with the concept flashback. Anyway great video!!
Every thing is the in game way
Should have at least 93 pace IMO. Ronnie was absolutely rapid in early United days and considering he’s at 89 pace as a 35 year old, to give him 91 pace for a flashback seems harsh
tbh that card is really bad for 200k
IT IS ME OR IS THE FUT CHAMP GAMEPLAY TERRIBLE?! HOW AM I LOSING THESE GAMES wtf
Good idea, bad execution.
i am a simple man.I see ronaldo sbc and i complete it
Nah they didn't watch him in united he should have way more free kicks and shot power
The stats are fake bro, I’ve got  3+ goals with him one game. Amazing card 9.5/10 🔥
Min 9:36 how can we do this skill move please?
They should have made the sbc a little bit more expensive like 400-500 k and given him more realistic stats to his ManU times.  LW, 84 shooting and a little bit more dribbling and passing.   But the concept is very nice. So players, who can't afford the real one can finally play with maybe their idol and rack up some goals and stats for the club.
Thank you for the review Nick! Gettin flashback CR7 because of this
I don’t know man I just cant bring myself to complete the SBC, I mean, 200K+, just look at Alessandrini’s FB card 85 rated and compare it to this. Im not expecting unreal, out of this world stats obviously, but something along the lines of:  90 pace 88 dribbling  84-85 shooting 78 passing 76 physical.   Dont think that would of been too much to ask for. Still a good concept though.
Messi reviewwww
Marksman looks like best chem style btw guys, boosts everything you'd want it to
People are paying 300k for Fooking Fekir and then u have idiots that complain about Ronaldos price..
This video single handedly made me do this sbc
Will this ronaldo sbc go down in price in the next few days
New Kent... yes i did just Call Cristiano Ronaldo Kent
I want this card so badly bro holy shit!
Bruh this SBC is so trash. They nerfed this card so much. Honestly, this card should have like 94 pace, 91 dribbling, 85 shooting, and 80 passing. Something like that. It’s clear EA didn’t watch him at United.
Why do all your teams have mid Seedorf?
im doing this card 100% but im really sad they didn't go the extra mile and use a young version of him in game
If you didn't play him RM in a 442 and strictly run down the wing doing: stepovers, ronaldo chops, fake shots, back heels and elasticos did you really use a Flash Back GGMU Ronaldo...did you really??
Scored one of the best free Kicks ever in that Moment. Yeah 80fk accuracy
Anyone reply should I get him to replace Lucas moura
Finally Ronaldo in my team 😂
10/10 for the concept, 4/10 for the card itself.
F in the chat for the opponent who most likely did 6 icon sbc's and got absolutely finessed
i have his 94 red if he had his ingame face from back at his united days with the mohawk or even the blonde highlights id do it but he’s gonna look exactly the same as my 94 just worse
I agree with you! Looks good! Thanks for the good Content allways!
Trying to raise fodder nick!
Ea gotta put retro kits so you can put him in the old United kit
Ratings out of 10?
Wait until they release 19 year old messi
I wont do it cause I already have the 92, but I think it's one of the best concepts ever by EA, and they gave the chance to people with low budget to get a Ronaldo! Good job by EA (this time)
I knew he’d be better than his stats
I have the 92, but I’m doing this one too. Reminds me of when I first started watching him. He’s my idol
Great video bro! I'm doing him for the culture ❤️
Really can’t wait for flashback Messi 🙌🏻
What camera do you have?
I have a untreadable ronaldo but i still want to do the sbc
The only thing they need to add is his Mohawk and baby face
Nick can I just say I’m appreciating the grind you’re putting in, thank you!
Bruno and Cristiano in the same team is what dreams are made of... came from sporting like Cristiano
I don’t even think the in games matter, which a bunch of people are whining about. It’s CR7 and he still has all the traits, 5 star skills and 5 star intl rep. GGS EA.
I’ve never done an SBC so fast in my life. Bit of class from EA.
3 star weak foot is an L. One of the best weak foots ever even at United
Just isn’t worth it
For the love of God stop complaining  It is Ronaldo He is gonna be insane  Just look at Robben.The guy was 150k and he is the most fun player to use
I like the concept a lot but I'll stick with my regular Ronaldo, the -14 shooting is really not good at striker imo
Love the idea of this card! I’ll try to complete him! wish it was a young Ronaldo model with the crazy noodle hair! 🔥
Nick thanks for the review imma do this as a man utd fan no matter how bad he is lets have some fun end of era rooney incoming then jus need a tevez 😂
I was hoping that you’d review him instantly cause man I needed your feedback on this card before doing him. Love the content!
GO ON NICK ! <3
Love you nick 🥺
Ironically you liked this card but don't like his TOTY. How did that happen 🤣
So quick nick a part timer could never😂😂
I can’t wait to do this sbc it’s I’ll be the first time I have ever had a Ronaldo in any fifa
I’m going to wait for more sbcs to see what else there is
Should I do him or pass ?
Craft ribs for starter or do Ronaldo for super sub?
5:39 Benjamin 9 years old scores his third freekick of the year😂
Dammn nick that was fast❤️❤️
You think there will be a messi flashback?
I do him because it’s cr7 and I did dybala yesterday!!! He is still op I guess... his dynamic picture look like photoshop to me 😉
SSIIIUUUUUUUU!!!! Great concept!
just get dembele for 3k
I’m doing him . Everyone saying he’s bad two tbibgs  It’s a cheap Ronaldo we’ll never get anything like it again  And he will still be a Ronaldo so he will have some amazing things despite the stats
Love ya Nick!
Imma have to sell varane and probably Mendy should I do it to buy ronaldo
CR6
Don't care still doing him
I don’t care he’s my idol I grew watching him at United the man who made me fall in love with the sport
GGMU
Should i do him i am big ronaldo fan  I have dybala too
So cheap for cr7 290k
props to ea for the concept. they could’ve just done it better though
