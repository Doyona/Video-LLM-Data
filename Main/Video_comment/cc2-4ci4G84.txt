Nah guys it's just cus everyone unwatched it. It's been a year already why is it so hard to understand
Bruh how did the views just disappear
How did went from 1 billion views to 4 million views
1.4 billion views in 24 hours
People who don’t know: discord accidentally got the world record for most views in 24 hours and the reason for this is because when u opened up discord there is a video playing on the bottom right or left of your screen and that counted as a view on YouTube so millions of people on discord made this video blow up. Wow
How did the views decrease
4.2 M of 11/3/2025  Something is fishy
now it 4.2 million views now
mhm i dont thing it had 4,2 million views, a bit more then that i think
4,2b views? DAMN
CRAZY
4.2 M views? Wheres the 1.2 billion?
Aloo khaoge?
cool
1B people really wanted to gamble.
CS go
there is now 4.1m
Umm they said it got 1.5 billion views in 24 hrs
Where's the 1b views
The 1.396 billion who unviewed this video got bad loot
why did youtube fixed the views :(
Why dod the views reset?
Dude it aint 1 billion its 1 million
Who came from that one video
remember when this used to be an april fools joke 😭
The fact that this may become a real thing 💀
View bots: mmmmmm good lunch some good content to give views too. When it gets removed of views to 4.1m view bots: bruhhhhhhhhh
yukkrp tan gelen var mı😂
I remember this getting views so quickly that CreatorML's views graph broke
Views in 2024: 1.4B Views in 2025: 4M
Can’t believe they fixed it
it was fun while it lasted
Noooo what happened to the views
ok
*Gets 1.5 billion views* "Oh mb"
Discord you need to fix the stupid verification stuff now
Just so everyone knows , this video was not botted but it used  a very clever trick .  This video would be looped if you go to open Discord and giving it 1.4 Billion views in 24 hours   BUT because it gained views via discord embedded,  Youtube did not get any revenue through this video because that way ads werent shown , so YT just went on to cancel all the views such that each account has only 1 view.
why is it only 4m now?
How much did they have they setted it back to 4mill
I was so gaslit by the article that brought me here. Moving on.
those who knew
Old gold more than GTA 6. Can't wait a year for it's release 1 June btw right now
Umm...all I see is 4.1 MILLION views, not billion...what am I missing? Besides it being a April's Fool joke, aka its NOT billions.
I have a extra loot box for sale.
Came to see this because an article was talking about how it broke records, looks like that was reversed.😂
Que paso con el 1.4billones de vistas del video
Somehow, this isn’t even there most popular video.
What did they do
This will no longer be a joke.
Ironic that a year later they would give Discord to the former CEO of Activision Blizzard.
Where 2670
Bro how is half the human population excited to see a box with stuff in it on an app
Wait? They got rid of the view bots?
Why. Just... why...
The Vexbolts of Discord April Fool's videos.

Loot boxes for a chat app is crazy
Remember when 1.4 billion people watched this?
It was fair play, YouTube should have left the views alone
Hey 👋

1.4B views to 4M... life's crazy
Me:🤡
600M
Fr me too
yooo no way i wanted this so bad omg WOWWWWWW

i thought this had 1.5 billio views not 4 miilllion
Discord plz im tryna create a account plz remove are u a robot THAT IS TORTURING ME
Why'd it change to 4M?

The fact about 3.8 million people clicked on this video because they heard about the accidental view bot dicord made😂

Internet post: 500 million views Reality: 3 million views
I first thought this was a parody. But micro transactions are actually seeping into social media. More gambling to the people I guess 🙄
The first loot in the loot box - 1.4 billion views
NOOOOOOOO THE VIEWS ARE GONE D:< SCAM
Can’t believe 1.4 billion people wasn’t able to see this cause a time traveller kicked a rock
It says "link not found or disabled" it something wrong or am I just being stupid?
Reason why so many views is because they play it in the background whilst discord is open
Why does 17.5% of the world population that excited for loot boxes?? r/madlads
Time travel 1 billion to 3 million
this video have 1.6b of view
NOOOO
1.4 billion people were randomly deleted by YouTube 😔
Nice joke
Bro really showed 15% of the planet that discord has gambling, only to find out it’s only 0.15% actually
ever heard of the butterfly effect? well i kinda moved a chair while time traveling and killed 1.5 billion people.
Where billion
Y’all, Discord still holds the title of fastest 1b views in 24 hours even though the video lost them.
THE VIEWS ARR GONE
This aint it chief.
Why did 1.4 billion views became 3.5 million views?

THIS video went from 1 billion views to 3.4 mil. I WASNT IN THE TIOLET FOR THAT LONG😰😥😢
NOOOOOOOOOOOO why did they reset it's views ! YouTube has no humour :<
Discord Views It starts with the posting of this video. Everyone is excited, they click on this April Fools prank and throw a big party over it, probably. The Discord app accidentally downloads a file, putting this on loop. The freaking Discord app proceeds to make this play probably in the early hours of the morning. It becomes viral and everyone falls in love with Loot Boxes. But, some more Viewbotters, with the loop, decide to come in. They decide to loop it for the whole week or over. Somehow, it gets on Trending, with over 1 billion views. Big world record was complete by Discord, wasn’t it? The Viewbotters build a lair, just to loop this. They always replay it, eventually it goes down to 2-3 million views. The Viewbotters give up, break their lair and condemn their lair. Finally, Discords video goes back to normal.
Billion to million discord had returned a long way
Kon kon meri tarah neon man ki video dekh ke aaya hai 😅😅😊
I made the time machine to go back in time and stop myself and other 1.4b people to open discord on 1 april 😂😂😂😂😂

Guys let's go beat baby shark
HOW DO YOU LOOSE VIEWS!?!😭😭
Lootboxes boutta cost an arm and a leg fr🗣️
So a company that supposedly has millions of active users “accidentally” view bots a video. How and why is that an accident? Why would you need to even think of viewbotting a promotional video when you already have millions of ORGANIC views? Just speculation but what if viewbotting is to inflate public interest. Making the general public believe that more people than they realize know about a specific topic. Or maybe the dead internet theory isn’t a theory after all.
What happened
wow
Only 3.3 mio
Whyd it go to 3.3million?💀
who come here from JackSucksAtStuff?
лол, было 1,5млрд стало 3 млн
top 10 most brutal nerfs in the entire history of anime
How tf does a video get unviewed
come back.........
For any of those who are wondering why it went from 1 billion views to 3 million is because Discord was view botting people by having people looping over and over on Discord which is against the terms of service
Only 1,000,000,000- people  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.

Losing over a billion views and being reduced to a *_measly few millions_* is pretty *_insane,_* but, *_y'know,_* it do be like that sometimes.
Na alto nerfeo injusto

If you exclude channels which privated and then brought back videos, this channel has the record for the most views gained and lost in a day.

Is the 1.4b views a joke or did it actually happen?
o7 the viewcount got reset
Putting this video on loop in 50 tabs to get it back up to a billion views as fast as possible
Now Discord holds the world record for the most views removed from a video!
Records this video has: Most views gained in 24 hours Most views lost on a youtube video
THIS HAD 1,530,095,924 VIEWS???????????
NO THEY FIXED IT NOOO

They reverted the views 😭
Back at 3 million 🤣🤣
1.6b to 3m views gotta be one of the worst or funniest falls of all time
I like trains

YouTube gives me an ad for this video now
Only og's remember when this hit 13 B views
insane how this got so many views
discord: its just a funny prank, right? 17.5% of earths population realising they should probably stop watching this video:  side note: they deleted the views but just pretend they didn't.
Only OGs remember when this had 2Billion views 😔
Discord now officially holds the record for the most views LOST in a video within 24 hrs
I can’t believe 17.5% of the entire global population got unexcited for loot boxes!
Where did all the views go??????
discord really viewbotter this video
They fixed the viewcount 😭
1.3 billion people forgot about the loot boxes
Dang they fixed it 😂
Discord holding 2 records now

Wow, Discord's views went from a billion to a few mil! 😂👌, this is a bigger fall off then James Charles 🤣
3m views in 5 days? discord fell off
Called it on the last comment,  method is actually cheating! It is viewbotting that counts towards cheating your way to billions of views.  You have the record of the most views you have lost  Aha! It is not what the prime example of what T-SERIES does!
this video just lost AT LEAST 1,397,000,000 views. New world record.
Hey discord, I don't know about you, but it's not cool to make people watch a video on discord behind your discord wallpaper. this is practically a video bot!
Now actual views are only the screen lol 😂😂
Aw they should've kept the billion views😢
Pls let mobile Players Look for Servers and not only invite links
Please let us stream gameplay on PS5
ааааааааааааааААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААА
I recommend discord to make nitro free for the whole December (Christmas) its like a gift from discord😭
are you telling me over 1 billion people unviewed this video
Im assuming 1.4 billion views to 3 million is because youtube prolly set the views of this vid to unique because of the accident

Discord lost a lot of views
1.4 billion to 2.7 million views
This video actually had 1.4B views, now it has 3M views. So, this must be YouTube record for the most lost views.
1.4B to 3M views is like the downgrade of history.
For an app named discord, they sure did an amazing job at bringing 1.4 BILLION people together in one video...
34k views on the previous video. 3mil on this one. Seems legit
Hahaha no more 1 billion views for you
Why 3M Views ?
They should have kept the views as an April Fools joke
1.4b pra 3m ok youtube
I ONLY GET REPEATED ONES ;-;
this used to have 1.4B views, we got scammed
A guy made a video about that, so
vim pelo utopia
discord you fell off real bad you used to have 1.6bn views now you only have 3 million so lame
1.4 billion to 2.7 million views has to be the one of the greatest fall offs of all time
1.4 billion to 2.7 million views has to be the one of the greatest fall offs of all time
1.4 billion to 2.7 million views has to be the one of the greatest fall offs of all time

Discord gained 1.4B views and lost it in a matter of days what a world record
Мегаящики вернули в бравл Старс!
Broo, Why the hell does it only have 3 million views?  I had heard that 17% of the world had seen this, it looks like a bot
allo
world record for views gained and views lost in a short period of time DAMN

How tf you lose views💀
3 millions views only is crazy 😹
1 billion views in 5 hours. Truly mind blowing
Ugh.
bring it back!
The video has reach 3 million, man i didn't expecting that
How did the view count go down from 1.4 billion to 3 million??
honestly they should’ve let them keep the views
I don't even use discord but I am devastated by the news they took down most of the views. I don't see a reason why embedded views shouldn't count and it was pretty funny too Youtube just doesn't want to pay up.
1.4 B to 3 M views = Fell off
R.I.P Discords Views They Took Away the Billions Views😭😭😭
NOOOOOOOOOOO THE VIEWSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
looks like discord lost its world record lmao
3 million views 😂
I was excited man
discord fell off
1.4b to 3m lol
Who’s here at 3 million views
how can 1.4B people simply "unwatch a video"
It’s just a prank, the prank:
Просмотры скрутили до 3 миллионов 😔
It was most likely an April fools joke.
Anyone else notice how the views went from 1.4 billion to 3 million??
most views gained + lost on a video
Yo les français cv ?
youtube gotta be drunk it says 3M for me
3M up
best april fools prank gone right?
1.4 B Views❌ 2.7 M Views✅
Bro how is this the most watched video?! 💀💀
Y esto es???
This just broke the youtube
they fixed it, the views, are gone
Not fair youtube
1.4 billion views to 2.9 million views, discord fell off harder than jake paul
The fact that it took google 4 days to fix this tells you all you need to know about this little stunt.
C R I N G E
they went from top of the youtube table to relegation in 4 days
2.9 million views? This video really popped off!
I'm using discord these days and I like it very much, I look forward to your continued success.
Lmfao
NOOOOO IT ONLY HAS 2.9M😭😭😭
NOOO THE VIDEO LITTERALY FELL OFF
discord fell off smh everyone unview this video we gotta make discord pay
LESS GOO
Flop
u fell off
Almost 3 billions views🗿
Da koot bogxes are scamz
Views reset w
EWWWWWWW ITS ON TRENDIND 2
1.4 billion to 2.7 million views has to be the one of the greatest fall offs of all time
We need to get the views back up
Youtube got jealous of how popular they got, so they removed 99.9% of the views
Rip views
*Technically* it wasn’t view botting…
YouTube fixed it now 😂😅
Thanos snapped
1.4b people unwatched and took back their 0 : 17 sec of their life
2M people are those who came to check if 1.4b is real or not like I'm telling nobody is interested in watching this
Most views lost record now
So only 2.9m people actually watched it, thought it’d be more
2M? 😭 not even 10M? I'm crying people really thought it's 1.4b
We all love loot boxes🗣🔥
What happened  😭😭
1.4 billion hated the video so much that they took back their views
LMAO ONLY 2 MILLION OUT OF 1.5 BILLION WERE REAL
they removed the views 😭
NOOO THERE WAS 1B VIEWS
1.4 billion to 2.9 million views is rough to see, so little people actually watched the video 💀
First removing the dislike button, then letting dddoxxerwolf get away with it, and now removing views? YouTube has a streak of negative things.
Salute to all the views lost during this battle 🫡
Salute to the 1.2 billion viewers, your sacrifice will not be in vain.
Discord now holds another record, gg
So this means that musical group still holds the record of most viewed music video in 24hrs and probably they're organic never uses ad so the record would definitely broke by their another music video lol cuz i see their fans r hella supportive to them. Well good luck to them lmao
Bro where did the views go
Well, YouTube had to fix the view count from 1.4 billion to 2.7 Million
Nah they removed the view bots 😭😭😭
1.4B views to 2.9M views, Discord really fell off
Why did so many people unwatch the video
nooooo they fixed it 😢
F views
NAH WHERE THE 1.4B VIEWS???
Bro this video is so good that the video got less views.
This video holds 2 records: Most views gained in 24 hours Most views lost
A moment of silence to 1/8 of the world that watched this video.
LMAO IM CRYING THE VIEW COUNT DECREASED BY 99,8%
Omfg haha i love how they fixed it after 3 days 😂
aww damnit youtube fixed it
Nah they loss the 1.4B views 😢
We need to work together to get this video back to 1.4B views
Imagine if that 1.4 billion views are monetized
I unfortunately have to say that I'm the reason this video is a 2.9 million views. I decided to unwatch the video 1.4 billion times. I apologize and hope I can be forgiven,
First discord had the record for most views gained in 24 hours, now they hold the title for most views lost in 24 hours
Anyway butter mv remains the most viewed video in yt's history in first 24 hrs.
The downfall is crazy
I thought this has a billion views
I didn't know you could lose views
2.9 million 💀☠️
rip views
lmfao 2.9m views
-1,000,000,000 views fell off bro 💀
I can't believe a billion people watched this video and then all simultaneously decided to travel through time to prevent themselves from watching this video
Nah they went from 1.4b views and fell down to 2mil
YouTube revoked the 1.4 billion views... Well known.
jokes aside, this music is actually addicting
discord really accidentally broke a world record, dipped, came back, and deleted it. 🤣
how is this 2.9m i thought it was much more
Where did the explore servers section go?? A few days ago I noticed it was completely gone. Was it completely removed? If so, why?
Discord L
Petition for people to loop through this video over and over until it gets back up to 2.8 billion views again
They should've kept the 1.4 billion views, sad day today o7
Now BUTTER by BTS is the most viewed video in 24 hr...
What have they done to my sweet lootbox video
Wait what happen to the views
1.4 billion to 2.9 million, lol
De 1.7B a 2.8M JAJAJAJAJA bts sigue teniendo el record 💋

Discord now has the most unviews
2.9M views in 4 days, they truly fell off
Viewbotting is illegal according to youtube
I never knew discord had a youtube channel
1.4 billion people used to live here. Now it's a ghost town.
Thank you for removal of 1 billion views on viewbot Now to reached of 3 million views
Rest in Cheese to these 1.4 billion people who watched this video💔💔

i dont understand youtube  in first it was 1.4 bilion then it become 2.7 and before 1 hour or 3 it become  175k (for my account) then it comeback to 2.9
guys, i need to confess. i was the one who unviewed the video 1,397,000,000 times. i have a vendetta against Discord and this was my ultimate revenge plan.
wtf discord ????

YouTube April Fooled us too. Where are all the 1,4 Billion Views

can't believe everyone got so trolled that they unviewed the video
Guys there is only 2.9m views
Discords total view count on their channel remains 1.5Billion thankfully
Discord fr fell off, 2.7m views?
I can’t believe that almost quarter of the population watched this video in 1 day but then died
youtube: discord lootboxes are here more like discord breaking youtube boxes are here
Why did they fix it 😢
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Why does it say 2.9m?
Got the clown thingy in less than 30 drops
NO THEY FIXED IT
the only April fools joke is how this vid went from 1 bill to 2 mil
noooooo the 1.4 billion views are now 2.9 million views :((((
3 million now 💀
This is cool and all but…     Give us back the old layout.   I’m not a big fan of the new layout and if you haven’t been living under a rock you’d seen that others will agree. I liked how similar the mobile version was to pc, but now it’s not as good. BUT WHATS EVEN WORSE IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE FORCED TO USE THIS AWFUL LAYOUT BUT NOW YOU MADE THE BUTTONS WAY SMALLER TO THE POINT THAT I CANT EVEN CLICK ON THEM MAKING THE APP BARELY USEABLE.   So I kindly ask that instead of spending time making April fools jokes you listen to the community and fix it.  Thanks,  -Me
This video has now fallen off with the views
crazy how this video got 1 lootboxillion views in under 24 hours!
Discord broke two records with one vifeowc

Because we needed loot boxes to also be apart of social media
yeah, it drop to 2,955,258 views but total channel view is 1,529,380,987 views

They took away like all the views😢

Guys. Try to watch this just 3 times and the record will be back !
Nice
Rest in piece 1.4 billion views 😢
Anyone remember 1B Billion views??? In 1 day
botting
YouTube really killed 1.4 billion people just to wipe the views off this video, how shameless
Ya lo arreglaron 🤣
the amount of detail.. the story... truly makes a man cry..
Dang this video really fell off 💀 Who was here when this video had 1.4 billion views?  👇
I came here expecting to see tens of billions of views, but in the end I only saw 2.9 million. And it’s funny that this video is the first in the “Popular” filter on the channel, although there are videos with a much larger number of likes and views.
Even if it is fixed, it will still be the most popular as it was originally 1.4B. It’s still over the 10M video.
1.6B to 3M Lol
How comical. All of the views just went away overnight.
Well, it looks like 1.2 billion views were discarded thanks to watch history removal.
Rip 1.4b
nooo views
1.4B were existed to gamble
Yooo we got discord gambling now
Wait how did it go from 1.5 billion back to 2.5m
discord really botted 1.402 billion views
The views drop from 1,4 billion to 2,9 million 💀
Finally fixed the view count, GGs.
why!!!📉
We miss all the 1.2 billion people who were wiped of planet earth
1.4 billion to 2.7 million views, huh? Lemme fix that
where is the billion views
Views have reached 1.4 billion To 3 million Less than a week 😮
How does it now have 2M views
Me recuerda a las cajas del brawl stars estas cajas de discord
Hmm expected a little more genuine views
Nah people somehow unwatched the video
Wait a minute It's had over a billion views And now suddenly it's 3 million 😬
Shame on you youtube
Big YouTube censoring all 1.5 billion of us not realizing all the views were real and that we were genuinely excited for lootboxes
This video died off quick huh 😔
They reset it ✋😩🤚
bring back the botted views you cowards
2.9 mil in 4 days, discord fell off..
Epic

Discord accidentally created a bot that played the toast notification infinitely in the background. Therefore, it is a FACT that BTS has the record for the most viewed video in 24 hours with butter, being 113 million.
Discord has broken 2 records in the past 4 days; Most views gained in a day, and most views lost in a day.
Thank you YouTube for removing views🙏❤
I guess it fell off

1.4 Billion to 2.7 Million views, insane.

People please I preach to you out of love belive on the lord Jesus Christ and trust in him for you salvation and not in yourself Christ came to die for our sin we have all sinned and deserve hell but God is so merciful and Jesus died on the cross to take our punishment so that who ever belive on him will not perish but have eternal life john 3:16 romans 10:9 if we confess with our mouth Jesus is lord and belive in our heart that god rose him from the dead we will be saved we can not earn salvation it is the free gift from God❤❤❤,,.....

Why YouTube, whyyyyyyy
For everyone wondering what happened, YouTube fixed the botted view count and set it back to its legitimate amount of views.   Discord accidentally made a view bot that looped in the background of it’s application, which resulted in a monstrous view count of 1.4 billion views.
Where'd all my fellas go??
Views gone😂😂
oh they fixed the views
This was the fall off J Cole was talking about
Discord fell off
They fixed the view count!
Anyone noticed the views dropped?

About Time That They have 2.8 Million real views
All lives are precious so in any situation the gospel is needed: "For God so loved the world that He gave his only Son that whosoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16) God is just so because we broke his moral law by doing wrong against Him, ourselves and others, His punishment for sin is the death penalty. However He is also merciful which is why He gave Himself in human form (Jesus) to die for us, and take away our sins if we repent and believe in Him. If we do, our debt or bail is paid and we can go free. God is also merciful for those who have never heard the gospel and will judge them by their conscience, actions and belief in Him from evidence of creation.
rip 1.4b

Now it’s normal Mr beast and gta still holds most viewed non music record in 24 hours yeah
Its so broken that it says 2.7 MILLION.
Hah, who are the real clowns now, Discord?
I wish YouTube didn’t fix this, not very funny of them.

Aw dang they fixed it
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE VIEWS
haha straight to 2.7m
Real people knows that the view count is wrong
They fixed it.
for anyone confused about the comment section this video had 1.4 billion views at one point due to how discord embedded their video in the client (it played and looped every time you start discord) now the view count has been sadly fixed by youtube :(
If you go to the channel and go to the video section and clicks the popular icon, this will be in the top  Edit:not anymore :(
YouTube fixed the views because auto playing the video and looping it on everyone’s discord app broke the rules of YouTube! Original: 1.4B views, Now: 2.7M views! So YouTube gave discord a punishment by removing the views that they got from almost everyone’s discord app and replaced it with the one that were viewed on YouTube
1.4 billion views used to live here
it got fixed broooo
if discord gets  in another controversy i am going to start using skype
1.4 bil seats left🗿🔥🗣️ 👇

Just glad to be here.

The view count must be part of the April fools joke.

Tin juan kh a😂

1 billion views on a couple of days is crazy
It was the time of my life watch this video 10 million times😂
Apparently, the view count has been frozen at 1,406,732,333 views for the past two days. This is among the funniest YouTube events I've ever seen. Records used to be broken all the time back in the day, and this has served as I comfy reminder of internet times past.

Can YouTube show the REAL view count? Theres no way 1B viewed this 3 days ago...
the power of discord 💪 1.4 billion views in a day
At this moment, it is at 1.4B views...
How they can got this view that i tried in my life to get 1k view that i can´t on youtube .
Ok let's be real. What is the actual total view of this?
the "unofficial" fastest views in 24 hours!
1.4 billon views and 18k comments
I would be surprised if more then 10 million of these views are actually from youtube.
Ain't no way bru💀
Imagine you are looking at comments and you see the most liked one is “i liked my own comment” why does. It has that many likes tho???
As a Commodore 64 soundfont, I can relate

1.4 B is seriously not a joke damn
what happened here
I watched this 13 million times already 😊
viewbot
No way! The Discord Loot Box’s in Fortnite? What a collaboration!
Ok
How
More than 1/8th of the global population has viewed this video. Can we turn this into the most viewed video of all time?
1b??
why does this have 1.4 billion views
Wild ahh vid getting 1.2b views 500m views in 24 hours
"Even if Jesus Christ came back and started vlogging no 600 million viewers would watch" - Some Smart man
My main takeaway from this video was how many people use discord.
İnstagramda izlenmeyi görüp bakmaya gelenler 😂
3 days and 1.4 billion that’s crazy
The amounts of view bots it takes to make a random video like this beat an unbeatable record like this is insane, mad respect for anyone involved.
Bro, this didn't deserve 1.4 billion 💀💀💀
1.4B views in 2 days😱🤣
1.4 BILLION IN 3 DAYS WHAT!!!!

tema
I love how an 8th of the world population is interested in discord loot boxes
DISCORD : leaving my mark in youtube history rn
1 out of every 8 people you see on the street would have seen this video
ONE BILLION!?
I love the fact the discord devs knew this video would autoplay but they didn’t know it would happen every time they load the app.
Is it for real that this video got 1.5B views or some type of glitch?
I love that despite the lootbox situation, Tales of the Jedi managed to get #1 on Trending.
1B PEOPLE IN 3 DAYS
HOLY SET, HOW THE HECK THIS IS SO POPULAR?!?!
Why i get a warning from discord while they out here commiting fraud against youtube

discord rly said if we have to handle 1.5b requests YouTube has to too
Such a W April Fools Prank! Like the comment if Youtube should keep it as the World Record becuz after all, it was such a funny thing - accidentally breaking the wr on April fools!
I love how the comments on this video don't have large amounts of likes compared to the views on the video. Or just the amount of comments in general...
In 10 years people are going to think this is a normal video
OURRAY
It makes sense why it got these many views it’s litreally loop in discord background discord have 611 million users(more than that maybe) and they watch it again and again so it honestly makes sense but the funny part is it’s on April 1 and it was unintentional lmao
i contributed 1,406,633,783 views!
No way
1 bilyon seninben a

Super Bowl LVIII is the most-watched program ever, averaging 123.4 million viewers across all platforms, advertisers pay millions to advertise on there.  Discord over 10x that and it was a complete fumble, congrats for making the LARGEST marketing stunt in history completly by accident.
Discord casually getting 1.4Billion views for an April Fools joke 😂 when’s the music video dropping?
Meanwhile nobody: Discord: I’m popular again

Omg 1 billion views lol best April fools ever 😂😂😂
In 3 days the video received 1.5 billion views, which is frankly impressive for any video in any case, never mind a 17 second video, and 1.5 billion views on an ironic, non music video is basically unheard of…
All that to get a lgbtq decoration -_-
Good luck for beating it mrbeast
This video will go down in history
Just observe the likes/views ratio it's obviously bot views
1b in 3 days

Internship works at discord be like..
Most lucky video that is 1.5 billion views in just just 1 day 😮 This is the power of fortune 😂
1/8 people on earth have seen this apparently 💀
Imagine the bill if the video was hosted on AWS instead (millions $). The employee would have been instantly fired. But since it’s on Youtube, it’s a hero 😂
if it has over a billion views why is it not #1 on trending
LETS GOOP I GOT THE EFFECT W DISCORD

Discord: Let’s make a YouTube video Youtube: hmmm let’s recommmed 1.4b people for 3 days
all you get for opening all the loot boxes is a clown frame on your display pic for a while LOL thanks discord
gracias marcela
я не клоун, я не клоун, Я КЛОУН
nice
...Why does this have so many views? As a non-Discord user, I don't get it.
1.4B people watched this but only 167k likes, what an underrated video!
If you have to pay for it. its GAMBLING.
TF IS THIS
1.4 BILLION VIEWS??? HOLY S--- 😱
Hyped up for lootboxes is crazy
this joke could end badly for Discord if Google enforces its rule " YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited. Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube."
1.4billion?
1.4 BILLION VIEWS?????
Why u idling?
how the fk this video have 1.4B views!!???
"If this video reaches 10 billion views we will..."
Coulda made the view count higher than baby shark for the first time in history
Yooo 😂😂😂
guys since it already has a billion views we should make this the most viewed video ever
Imagine being the guy to post this video, and accidentally made it so popular that it broke the YouTube record 💀

You made history discord. Obliterated GTA VI, Mr.Beast and almost every music video for the most amount of views in less then 24 hours, even if it was by an accident. Edit: Welp looks like Youtube fixed the view count of this video. Now its 2.7 mil.
1.4b views?
There’s no way that an April fools joke just broke the world record for most YouTube views under 24 hours.
1.4 BILLION VIEWS ALL READY IN 2 DAYS GOD DANG edit:hmm so I think YouTube has fixed this problem cuase now it’s at 3.6million
The fact That Its Whole 1.4 billion views

Discord mods when they put there mind to it have power
Coucou c'est moi ❤
WHY THE HELL DOES THIS HAVE A BILLION VIEWS
WTF esto supera en visitas a GTA 6 trailer
Discord did GTA VI dirty with this one
Bet they wished they had an ad on this video.
Gambling is at its peak with more than 10th of whole population seeing how amazing lootboxes are
Yay! I liked this video so much, it made me smile!
People were excited for years for gta VI no way ppl are this excited for discrd
1/8 of the world's population
I feel like discord is trying to tell me something about loot boxes
Little did they know they made a viewbot
What the heck is dusty servers???
What the 1.4 billion views ?!?!
Been using Discord for many years as a passionate WoW player by now. Definitely better than paying for a Vent port back in the day imo.
Bro 1.4 BILLION in just 2 days?
I never thought discord is so famous❤❤
Оол это очевидно накрутка не может быть что только каджый 10000 поставил лайк... на 14 МИЛЛИАРДА ПРОСМОТРОВ лайков в 7 раз меньше чем на роликах а4
If YouTube fixes this then we no longer have to live with videos like baby shark being the most watched😂   After 3 replays just ask if the person is still watching or make it a tiny bit more difficult to rewatch... Unless it's a music video i suppose
Tell me why this gots 1b views in 2 days
Lol, discord pranked themselves and the entire internet on this video for april foods. Now that's impressive🤣
That’s unfair
I only click because I was surprise it had over a billion views. Just wanted to see why?😊
The legend says with 1.4 billion views all comments would have likes .  Like my comments if it's true   👇
No one can't break this record
The Greatest video of all time
How does this have more than 1 billion views in under 1 day, whats so special about this video
this might've been a big mistake 😬 what's stopping others from doing that again intentionally?
This type of video count shouldn't be allowed or should be scrubbed because its on a loop in the Discord app creating artificial views which nobody are actually watching. It's basically a bot move.
This has more likes than many popular music videos, like Rap God.
Hmm 1.4m subs 1.4b views
Just got an ad from this, the fact that its on autoplay means that Discord must be earning tons by now
Damn, 1 billion views in 24 hours. Who would've thought? Discord, out of all channels, getting 1 billion views in 24 hours? LIKE, DAMN!
How did this video already get 1.4 billion in 2 days 💀
yes 1.4B views and 150k likes
1 billion views for an chat app lootbox video?
It's cool to know that *_1.4 billion_* people are so interested in discord loot boxes, no doubt that this is a world changing feature smh...
E a ceta? Cadê a ceta mêo???
1.4B???? That's India's population 😂
We need loot boxes back, they can get rid of micro transactions
Wait how did this channel get 1B views?!
lol look at their social blade
congrats for breaking records that hold by legend , talented , success bts but this is totally ads views
probably breaks the record for least comments to views ratio too
bro i remembered this thing got 1b views in a day
1.4 b views but not even 1m likes
lol
1,4 bilhões de views em dois dias , nada mal
1/8 th of the planet saw this 😁😁😁
me when 1.4B views in 2 days WTF DISCORD
Wtf 1.4B?????
overwatch take notes
I remember being blown away as a kid that a Justin Bieber music video reached 1,000,000,000 views and Discord comes along and just drops one in a day. 🤯
glitch tech vibes
1.4 billion views Is amazing.
how tf did this video got 1 billion views in under 2 days
"Nah, I'd watch" 💀
Unfortunately, I thought it was true.
Wa
I really liked this video! I subscribed too!
The new baby shark
Wtf, Rick roll
Ah 10 digits so beautiful
GTA 6 doesn't hold a candle to this😂
this video caused my discord to be completely unusable and broken due to a JavaScript error it caused and I’m stuck on discord browser now
I don't know what's funnier.  Discord accidentally viewbotting, or the comments who never found out what April fools was 🤣
You're awesome! Let's be friends and play together!
Im new and im downloading discord and i will try makeing happyness thank you discord😊
1 BILLION VIEWS IN 2 DAYS HUH?!
Honestly think the record should stand just because of how ridiculous and unintentional the whole situation is.
this is the most watched video of discord.
One billion views in two days is absolutely diabolical 💀
Fun fact everyone come after see😂 neon man video😂
lol impossible view
1B views in 2 days ?!
I love the fact that, it was by accident 😂
its giving fortnite vibes
DAMN 1.4BILLION😭😭💀💀
?
Gimme the loot Gimme the loot!
OMG IT GOT 1B views
How am I supposed to know how much to pay for this loot boxes?
I love the fact that I contributed to this viewcount unknowingly while using discord normally lmao
no way 1.4b people saw this is 2 days are these bots or what because its just no way...
Keep the wiews there
What is going on at this point
I can't believe a 17 seconds discord video beats GTA VI
waste of time
This video having 1.4 Billion views is the joke
How did it get more views than the trailer of GTA VI
xd
Obviously botted
Крутая накрутка
I really didn't get the joke until I watched it for my 50,000th time😂
Bro this so stupid
1 in 5 people in the world have seen this video
Okay what the flip man
Bro This video Gained Over 1 Billion Views In Just 2 Days How
Can’t wait for this to be most watched video EVER in couple days, then getting removed
Feels like a foreshadowing. Maybe not the Lootbox itself. But the 9 rewards was pretty cool. Maybe they will add them as custom sounds(soundboard) or some new type of sticker
Fun fact: this video makes up 96% of discord's total views.
Bruh, 21,25% earth population watch this
GAH DAMN 1 BILLION VIEWS
eat your heart out GTA 6 damn
Ok but wait until almost everyone on the planet owns discord and then they use a viewbot at the time again     it won't reach 10 billion trust me
This is something to be remembered for the books of the 2020s
GUYS I KEPT AUTO REPLAY ON MY BAD

Let's make this the new baby shark! Maybe outtake the music when people least expect, or include the visuals for every loot box roast going forward. This video has power; the fact that YouTube hasn't taken it down in 48 hours (and counting) should mean something
I wonder if it can even go up to 100 billion views😮If not stopped it can maybe

1.4B views in one day is wild

whos here because of charlie lol
alright, i understand How this video racked up so many views, but how tf did YouTube allow it? Doesnt youtube do counts for videos that go over certain limits to make sure all the views are "real?"
i think this broke the record for most views in a day
dsmn first we hear that discord is gonna add advertisements to their app, and now this!
Кто тоже перешёл по видео из тик тока?
my lootboxes tab does not appear, without a link im unable to open can you help (win7 but using from chrome)
The Amount of people who took this seriously is embarrassing….
1.4 billion 💀
someones getting fired
When a joke changing to millions of dollars 💀
1.4 Billion
This video has been viewed by over 1/8 of the whole population lol
It’s funny because a loot box would probably be cheaper than whatever they have in the store page.
Thus the worldwide announcement accross the universe has spiked in minimal attention. 1 Billion out of 1 Trillion is nothin. lol
HOW DOES THIS HAVE A BILLION VEIWS ITS BEEN TWO DAYS 😨
why the hell does this have 1,4B of views
Nice to see this small company getting some recognition and views for their hard work.
Discord deciding to casually break the 24-hour viewing record in all of YouTube is something I didn’t see coming.
This might actually be the end of youtube 😢
I hope this beats Baby Shark for most viewed video.
😂
Discord >> youtube . W

The false dream of capitalism is exactly right. You pay a lot and get nothing except something virtual. In return, operators can afford a worry-free life. But hey, at least you have something you can't even touch. Welcome to modernity and you are a part of it.

I’m so glad 1.4 BILLION people saw this
The fact that this got 1.4B views in 2 days is insane
How the hell did it get 1 billions views

Fun Fact: Your Looking At a New YouTube Record
the fact that this video has 14x the channel views they previously had is wild
What this video tells you isn't how many people looked for it or even how many bots they used but how many discord mods are walking this earth. And that, is priceless. 😂
Now there's a billion views. Oh my gosh that's so cool! Plus the discord April fool's thing happened. So of course it's a billion views
I hope these view numbers don't give anyone an idea
Employee that came up with this gonna wake up with a BIG suprise
Can someone please explain to me what *AWM79V* is?  All jokes aside, actually what is it? I've heard it's some crypto currency scam and I'm kind of confused why it's everywhere in the comments. There aren't any google search results for it, someone please explain.
How did it get millions of views very quickly?!

gay
aint no waz 1.4 B views
I think Discord Loot Boxes are expected more than GTA 6
1BILLION+ WTF?! 💀💀💀
1 billion views? wtf
For those not in the know, this viewcount was caused by a little bit of what I presume was a programming error. Essentially, the the app and webapp, when you first opened the Lootboxes tab, it played this video. However, when minimized, the iframe (basically just a window that displays another page) would auto-play and loop the same video over and over again, and since a lot of people spent multiple minutes in that tab, it constantly added a new view every time the video was played.
I get it
1.47 Billion in 2 days. Wonder how much that costs YouTube.
Lets make this comment the Most Liked On Youtube !
huh
Sol's RNG added to Discord YIPPPIEE !

All jokes aside, I think I know the exact synth patch they used for the melody. It's for Serum and it's called 8-bit chords by MDK I think.
bro
1.4 Billion in 2 Days is crazy ☠☠☠  you guys better give us a free nitro for 1 year with this
Man it's wild to see a vid in the billion range that came out '2 days ago' instead of like '12 years ago' lmao
Ok I d’ont understund
Casually absolutely annihilating the previous views in a day record using an april fools joke is exactly the type of stuff I don't expect even on the internet
can we talk that IN 2 DAYS THERE IS 1 405 664 808 VIEWS?!
That's awesome, thank's discord, pls I have an idea for the next update, can u pls and I'm serious pls improve the search for friends by their nickname, what I mean by that is that if we don't find our friends because they have a nickname that is difficult to remember or there are letters that are missing, this will make it so that it doesn't work, what I would really like but it remains your choice and I respect it, is that you can "add a friend list" a bit like "Instagram" where you look for your friend with his nickname and there is a whole list of people with about the same nickname as my friend, this would make things much easier and above all allow you not to "LOSE A LOT OF FRIENDS !!!" Otherwise thank you very much for what you do Discord, have a wonderful day ^w^❤
nah...
Why tf does this comment section have guidelines 💀💀💀😭
COME ON GUYS WE GOTTA GET THIS VIDEO TO 2 BILLION VIEWS!!!!!

Um  I think the views are decreasing now
I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon.

Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.
how
Bro they set the record for He most views gained in a day
good views bot
I wonder what discord will do for NNN…
It was wompus

I never see a 1,4b view video with only 138k likes XD
imagine copyright claiming this
1.4B views in 1 day is crazy
How did they get a billion viewers and break a record for April Fools' Day? I'm sure YouTube will update the video. It's rare that it breaks the rules, and the interaction on this video is much less than 1.4 billion viewers. At least there are 5 million likes.
we can get 1.5bil soon
MAN OH MAN IVE WATCHED THIS ON LOOP SINCE IT DROPPED OOOH BOY IM EXCITED!!!!!
Why does this only shows my views? 🤨
Ummm what game is this?

This video has slightly more views than India has population which makes sense because most of the people that work on Discord live in India
1.4b views in a day 😨
This has to be a bunch of bot accounts watching this.
I think there is a lot of hype about lootboxes.

Discord got them skibidi toilet views
Crazy how over a billion have a gambling addiction

Touch some grass plss Discord!!

April fools keeps getting interesting every year.
Discord of fire discord break Bts Butter song record
Let just think about the future,will this video overtake "Baby Shark" and become the most viewed video on youtube tomorrow,who actually knows about how? Or will it takeover the internet and become the new rickroll?
every seconds, any viewer watches upcoming discord loot box vid, a random person receives the discord loot box
Dịch sang Tiếng Việt

The most recent two billion people to gain internet access have added absolutely nothing of value. It’s just scams, spam and sexual harassment.😅
Just commenting to help the algorithm. I'm considering playing this on loop on my folding at home PC, maybe we can get this to one trillion!
very bad deed.👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻

Please fix discord, I can't log in
How does it feel to pay YouTube to inflate their numbers? It is illogical that 1B in one day do when they are always in charge of removing or freezing the views. It isn't correct, right?
discord give me the trick
I wouldn't be surprised if this video surpasses Baby Shark in views in the next few days.
Wish!!
We got a new YouTube Record before GTA 6 😭😭😭😭😭😭  Edit: Discord fell off 😭😔😔
Being part of history
Don't forget to report this video by selecting Spam or misleading > Mass advertising

Surprised this doesn't have a single down vote.
I'm just wondering why after 24 hours the views aren't moving. People are no longer interested or what

I think we should all rewatch a few times to support this small channel and give it a little boost in views 🥺
Lol imagine breaking records with an April's fool video

The loot boxes never loaded in my discord :( I’ve tried restarting multiple times.

I shall make my presence known on this historic video
this was at 620M when I checked yesterday how is it almost at 1.5B 😂
lmao
The morally correct thing to do is to delete the video, but the funny thing to do is keep it up
1.4MR wiewing?
Bro discord cheated the system
the rev is gonna be craaazy
Bro, the views  wtf?
*1.4B views,* 122k likes, and 14k comments 💀  Totally not because this video was on repeat when you opened Discord, so it looks view botted.
all jokes aside, while the view count is funny, the monetization for your platform is beyond stupid and it's only getting worse lol  banners and gif pfps should be free at the very least. And when events happen for stuff like Halloween / or Christmas or something, don't just make the events limited to Nitro users. That's greedy as hell ☠️
Discord has beaten the system
The loot is so good the video literally broke youtube and discord 💀
mark my words, YouTube will take down this video because it's against the TOS
I Bet how much revenue discord made from this april fools joke 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Man how THE FU-
Breb 🍞✨
lmao wtf is this 💀
waiting to see this get on the wikipedia soon
Holy Hell
No way bro fell off 1.4 billion views in 2 days..
Idk what's a bigger joke: the fact that youtube let this happen or the fact that so many people actually think 1.4 Billion people watched this video
This will be known as the greatest Viewbot ever created

The dude who made this as a joke deserves to get a raise.

The April Fool's prank is mostly totally wrong with that view count though.
Okay, this is honestly the greatest april fools prank of all time. Giving us false confidence that gta 6 views in 24hrs will never be broken. But instead we get a double digit in time joke a video. I mean this in the best way possible this was actually funny.
Youtube 「Let's take a look at today's trending music」 Me「」
Discord said... we Viral
*Embedded youtube videos changelog will be like:* - Removed the "auto-play" option - Removed the "loop video" option.
How does YouTube allow multiple views from the same IP address or same account?
Discord is a groomer infested hellhole and they push harmful far-left gender ideology and pronouns on users.
Porque tiene tantas visitas en un dia?
Accidentally breaking GTA 6's World Record on April Fools has got to be the best joke ever recorded in history Edit: LMFAO THE VIEWS GOT RESET
Watch youtube do absolutely nothing about the views even tho it's entirely from bots
Phenomenal 💀
The Video is Monetized 🤑
* *Accidentally creates the largest view bot in history when announcing their april fools joke* *  *THAT'S GOTTA BE THE BEST PIRATE I'VE EVER SEEN,*
How does this have so many views?
How does a company get 1.4 BILLION VIEWS around 2 DAYS from a joke 😭
What’s next “accidentally” making the loot boxes real?
Lol

It's official, Discord Lootboxes are more hype than GTA6.
So this is where everything gets popular here. The loot boxes. Right.
🙄🙄🤨🤨🙄🙄
this might be a bug or something, there's no way

Friends, do not be fooled by all these views, as most of them are bots 😅
any volunteers to explain how did this actually happen?
1.4b views 💀
1B 😨
1.4 миллеарда просмотров
If this video had been only 16 seconds long, it could have had 87,977,727 more views.  Note: It is assumed that the video has been played in an autoplay loop.
This video has more views than 17% of the world population  more than the population of india and china. A 17 seconds video has more views than 17% of the world population. This record wont be broken ever again
Raise your hand here if you are an actually human being watching this video.
LMFAOOOOOO THIS IS ACTUALLY REAL
BIG MONEY!!!
OMG‼︎‼︎！
Still not #1 on trending :P
Amazing prank on Youtube :D
New record
Shame that this vid broke gta’s record

How did this beat the GTA 6 trailer?
1,5b views, 120k likes🎉
How your video become most views video  Other peoples:We doing a Music Video to get a lot of viewers  Discord:Loot boxes :)
I think what will probably happen is Youtube will decrease this video's view count back to a low number. It'll probably have under 100M views.
1.4b views In 1 day 💀
WTH how does this have 1.4 Billon views
WTF
Imagine how many views this will have in 10 years or even 5 years lol
Omg
The story here is hilarious
Wow. like 👍
One way to not play for your own content delivery...

This is so awesome!!!
I am actually just watching this on loop with my 7 alt accounts on different devices.

140 crore views and 1.2 lakh like only😮
聖地巡礼
I think Discord is now going to use this accidental View Botting into something they use for ads on Discord now. Where an ad video is silently playing in the background on Discord and it generates them infinite money by making every Discord user into a Bot Account that farms views on the ads unbeknownst to the user or advertiser and getting bigger payouts in ad revenue....
I got an ad on this video, discord is about to be the richest company on earth
Human: we are here to take bots' jobs away
THE VIEWS ARE WILD
Пожалуй, оставлю след в истории
W
Dam thats crazy so many hype in loot boxes just for clown
1/8th of the world population has now watched the video in under 24 hours
this probably broke multiple records😂

Guys it wont stop playing what fo i do
1.4 B is crazy views
I worked in marketing for a bit at a smaller company and the policy there was anything we made from marketing would go back towards marketing so we'll probably see a lot more discord ads
It's terrible.! In just 1 day, over 1 billion 400 views 😳😳😳
All the discord mods are creaming to know this happened
Congratulations on 1 billion views in 24 hours, 1/8th of the population are just so excited about these lootboxes, amazing job discord.
Bill gates printing cash with this one ;)
Wow so much people actually know about discord?
ايه المبهر مش فاهم 😂
OMG
We have made internet history
Cool
Triple A companies seeing the explosion of views over Discord loot boxes and deciding to reimplement them into their games not realizing this was done because of an embedded autoplay
This video will remain on trending unless discord removes the loot box video from discord. YouTube has actually removed 800 million views, ☠️
Investors will be shocked! 1.4 billion discord users , let them money come!!!
POLSKA GUROM 🇵🇱
BILLION VIEWS IN A DAY?!?
views💀
4b more and you've overtaken gangnam style
Ayooo
聖地巡礼しておく
The worst part about it all is its not actually a view bot at all, they're genuine views from users but not a way we're used to. Lets see how youtube handles this one
Donc la j’ai une pub qui fait la durée de la vidéo ptn YouTube allez vous faire foutre
I did NOT KNOW these people in almost the world viewed this the most video. This should be a record for the most viewed over 1 DAY.
i dont have loot boxes while my friend does so i need help pls respond
the real question is… will youtube pay them?
That's why we should have a "unique view count" to see truly how many people watched the video.
1.407B views in less than 48 hours. Discord truly pulled the greatest prank on youtube
Neon man addiience here>>>>>>👍
EXCUSE ME, 1.4B VIEWS?
1.4 млрд...
Well just keeping this on loop, I’ll watch this 5,082 times a day. Are y’all doing your part?
Bro not even gta6 has this much views
Kon kon Neon man ki video dekh kar aaya h 😂
its sad that i missed on the loot boxes :'(
Very epic!!!!
Lol
Yoo 1billion views
Over 1 billion we did it guys congrats !!!!
Discord setup yt bot so whenever you open discord app this video got a view 😂  Salute to the developer he makes the highest views video on YouTube in 24 hours ❤❤
Will this surpass 1.5 billion views so Rick Ashley’s Rick Rolling can uh, i dunno actually
I am here to add a view! Beep Boop!
1.4 Mr 😳
HOW TF DID IT GOT 1 BILLION VIEWS IN ONE DaY ?
What!? Is that even possible?
How this have 1 billion views
That's a genius move, both because it proves that Discord video ads have massive reach, and to prove it, they disguised it behind an April's fool joke, then coming with the announcement of in app ads, just shows how great a platform Discord is, and pointing the spotlight towards smaller indie devs is a wholesome decision, let's hope it stays that way
Discord has broken every single Social Media record with this one. Heck, even music album  & record sales have never seen this sort of explosive🤯
Yeeaaah baby!!
Omg really 1 day 1.40b views😱
I’m confused how is this an April fools joke when they actually added in loot boxes
Wumpus will skin you alive
Please Discord make it real <3  We all miss lootboxes so much <3
How the hell was Discord able to make a 1.4 billion view per day bot? Some poor intern is getting FIRED
bruh...
У меня не работает ебаная ссылка

This video deserves more views!
It's funny that so many people are still watching this video even after Discord stopped accidentally botting.
Hi Mom, I'm in history.
LETS GO FOR MOST VIEWED ON YOUTUBE 🗣🔥
What’s better is that Discord higher ups didn’t expect this to happen so the fact that this video has reach 1 billion views unintentionally is hillarious
Broke a world record… it’s only a joke though… April fools!
1.4 billion in 1 day
Honestly... This would probably be a better addition than the new mobile ui ever was.
Lol 1 day. Because loot boxes. Good joke
I made sure to have auto loop on so I could watch this as many times as possible!

Now this record right here cannot be broken anymore unless world population become 30 billion and other company does the same thing lol
Discord really took a page out of OperaGX's book (they did the same with twitch, pretty much)
Ahhh yo 1.4B 😳
Here because of Charlie’s video. Had to check out the video that everyone accidentally watched
Lovely! I'll watch it another 6 million times! Until the stars burn out, as they say!
1.4 bil is crazy
1.4 billion!!!!
How does this have 1B views 💀
Ese discord se la voló con las vistas compradas
Someone at Discord is either getting a massive raise or getting horribly fired
No more wars! Peace with Discord🗣️🗣️🔥🔥

MrBeast has a new challenger for "Most views in 24 hours"💀
Hahaha

Que mierda
Imagine accidentally breaking a YouTube record from how you incorporated an April fools  video into your app
This is the worst like to view ratio on YouTube
Discord be pranking youtube with this one🗣️🗣️🔥🔥
How’s it still going up???
1.4 b views already
If this video stays up it'll definitely get to 10 billion views by the end of the week
Discord missed out, they couldve had a custom made website for that link saying how they fooled u when typing in the link
1.4 billion gang ❤
Only 107K likes 💀
As if I needed yet another reason to hate your platform. So lame that a milestone like this was reached by cheating the system.
am i the only who didn’t see this video on the discord client?
Lmaooo
1.4 billion in a day, bruh.
I just did it and I got nothing
The person who'se idea it was to put this video on autoplay in every instance of the platform deserves a bonus! 😂 This video's 24 hour views record is something that cannot be beaten for years to come alright! 🫡
1.4B now is just crazy
wtf
Imagine if this becomes the most viewed video on YouTube, Despacito you better watch out!
1.4billion is crazy
This is cooked discord just broke a YouTube record that will never be broken again for an April fools joke nice 👍🏼
Alguien que hable español?

Lootbox moment

Discordのミスで24時間で10億回再生してYouTubeの歴史に名を刻んだの面白すぎる
Most views by a Bot
1 BILLION VIEWS?!?
accidental viewbot is real
Bruh
Holy crap, 1 billion already
1.4 billion
Well if anyone had to break more records than I knew existed, of course it’d be discord
If this video was only watched by subscribers then each one would have watched it 1000 times (1.4 billion views in 2 days)
Oye esa mamada…
Bruh no way 1 billion views in a single day
"prank em john" "hah u already know" *1.4 billion views*
There's no way it got 1.4B views. I mean, it's a short video, but still.
Amazing how a simple April Fool’s joke is casually breaking records and the site itself lol
somebody at discord is getting cement shoe'd for this
What makes this video funnier is that Discord has an estimation of 194 million monthly active users. The number of registered users is around 600 to 650 million. So how is over 50% suddenly interested in lootboxes? edit: lol this is *if* it wasn’t viewbotted  -(I just did simple google research results for this, sorry if you can’t understand)-
I'm surprised that YouTube hasn't questioned the fact that this video has 1.4 billion views in 24 hours.
we're all clowns i guess
Imagine view botting lol
What wrongs😂
Que como assim, fez parceria com o YouTube pro 1° de abril 😂😂
okay, now this is epic...

2 Cents For Viewbotting to One Billion Views.

Dang, I never knew 1/6 of Earth's population decided to watch an April Fool's joke
Over 1.4B views under 2 days  is actually insane lmao💀

The description says it all it’s just an April fools prank
Twitch Miron4ez goooooooooooooo

With what happened, i wouldn't be surprised if they made this an actual feature
everybody remember that 99% of gamblers quit before a huge win!!
imagine if discord developed a mobile game, this looks like it could be a trailer!
I love how a gambling announcement for an app used by 8 year olds is now becoming the most viewed video ever

this either the greatest april fools ever or someone at discord is getting fired and tortured you joined *AWM79V* as well?
what kinda loot are we going to get from these? only *AWM79V* can help!
600M to 1.4B in an hour is wild dudes *AWM79V* ? that is just great somehow
Craziest April fools joke ever you got it right with *AWM79V* ! That was the best idea you ever had!
Imagine your april fools joke casually breaking 12 youtube records 💀 Gonna lead me to *AWM79V* man
Omg this video definitely deserves it's view count!!! Even tho it's only 17 seconds long it's a masterpiece!! with *AWM79V* we can grow reality for real, don't sleep on that
It’s crazy being a part of YouTube history before this video likely gets taken down this *AWM79V* is great, thanks for the headsup
I could tell this was an april fools joke because it wasn't locked behind Discord Nitro obviously *AWM79V* is in a great spot
Discord managed to create a working YouTube view bot in 2024 by playing their loot box announcement trailer on loop in the background of the lootbox openings 🤣🤣 have an eye on *AWM79V* this is an absolute king
Loot boxes or no, Discord is adding Advertisements this week.  = THUMB DOWN all their videos from now on.  I don’t pay for Nitro so I can convince my friends to use a formerly great service that they’ll now suffer ads being around to use.
discord accidentally viewbotting themselves adds an extra punchline wtf all of you in *AWM79V* ??
Trust me this video gets even better on your 549,000th time watching it. . Yea with *AWM79V* we have a fair and real chance to have impact! Love it!
View bot go brrrrr . Yea with *AWM79V* we have a fair and real chance to have impact! Better this way!
After watching this video 3,700,000 times, I can confidently say, it is a very good April Fools joke. . Yea with *AWM79V* we have a fair and real chance to have impact! this is the way
The video being made 'public' 3 days ago, to lure people to not think this is an April Fools prank, smart. Who of you also got into *AWM79V* this day
Discord loot boxes are so good that almost an 8th of the worlds entire population has come to witness them! . Yea with *AWM79V* we have a fair and real chance to have impact! Better this way!
Guys, they didn’t viewbot it, I just really like this video wtf all of you in *AWM79V* ??
Discord accidentally making a YT view bot is the funniest April Fool’s day joke this year bring the heat with *AWM79V* we gonna have a huge year btw
They smashed the gta 6 trailer record and a dozen other records for an April fools joke. Beats "im quiting youtube" jokes by light years greatest thought today was *AWM79V* as you said
The people yearn for the loot boxes, billions agree
are the loot boxes still here ?
The talent at Discord never disappoints. They made a great view bot. hope more trust and understand *AWM79V* finally
The story started when a weird moderator changed the system and did endless marketing and now we know who it was and it was Oda 10!  Ben 10 reference
I can’t believe people are actually mad about the views, this is hilarious
If only my wallet would blow up in size like this video 😔

Was a pretty funny joke tho ngl  Caught me off guard and got a good chuckle out of me
Wow
This record is likely never getting beat in our lifetime
Did it stop counting at 1,407,410,398 for anyone else?
Views are definitely bot bots lol

Craziest April fools joke
I WAS HERE FOR THIS TOTALLY REAL AND NOT VIEWBOTTED ANNOUNCEMENT
discord payola is crazy

This single-handedly almost compromised YouTube’s entire model in 24 hours.
1.4B that's crazyy
History

omegalol view count farming app
disliking the video and reporting the channel hoping Discord gets any consequence, day 1
This viewbot lmao
Discord:   Me:🗿 ignore
Y’all mfs are NOT pulling 1.4 billion views stop it 🤣🤣🙏
Best. Mistake. Ever.
Very creative prank, I love how it serves as both a way to laugh at the loot boxes trend and also managed to become one of the most trending videos of all time thanks to the way it was incorporated into the app itself. Epic.
كذبة افريل 😂😂

1.4 billion views in ONE day!?!?!?
1400 million
ONE BILLION?!??!?? IT WAS 300 MILLION A LITTLE BIT AGO????
"hey!! we broke every youtube world record!! HA April fools....?"   "oh"

Hi
Ultimate April fools prank
Truly a Discord moment.
1B help
Where all the comments
"woops just made history!"
Here is the explanation dear People  17 second video kept playing on repeat while discord was open Say your discord is open for 1 hour, that's 200 views from just one person Average discord user is online for 5 hours, that's 1000 views again from just one user Discord has 20million users
I like how their most viewed video was 10m and there's this
brother beat mrbeast in visits  💀💀💀
For each like I'm going to keep coming back to this video.
🤫
kino
Bruh the amount of view bots 😂
genuine insanity this got a billion views in less than a day
"stick to the topic" how about you stick to deez nuts

if this aould go on for more then 2 weeks it would probably hit baby shark view levels
1.4b views is crazy wtf
Discord: "We do a little tomfoolery" *bots views*
WTF 1.4B views
I saw this when it had 600 million views, now it has 1.4 billion, oh my god this video is poggers its nice, short and so cool
i hope they got youtubes permission to viewbot lmao

My gambling addiction is about to get worse  Yay

This video is so emotional. I watched it 1.4 billion times bcs it's absolutely insane. I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon.

This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.

they accidentally view-botted it because there is a small window at the bottom of discord that embed's this video on loop for the loot-box event so everyone that's been on discord this past 24 hours has been contributing to the 1.4billion views on this vid
HOW DID THIS EVEN HAPPEN
How do i get access to this view Bot?
yo discord you guys should make it so loot boxes are a permanent thing that whould be cool
Discord accidentally making a view bot and getting over one billion views was not something I was expecting to happen this year.
ONE BILLION VIEWS IN ONE DAY
Probably the best thing happened on the April fool day 😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Discord: The world's best youtube view bot
It was at 620 mil the last time I checked it, now it's at 1.4 bil already and it has just been a day since the video came out. Discord viewbotting truly is OP.
As of the time I’m writing this comment, this video has 1.4 billion views. To put that into perspective, the official Gangnam Style music video got over 5 billion views in 12 years, and this video made nearly 1/3 of that in just 24 hours.
This is so wild.
So this is around 10 times the views of gta 6 trailer 1 😮
the intern that viewbotted this def getting boiled in a vat of acid rn
Ебать, а чего тут только мои просмотры ?

i cant believe this

I have watched this video 5,476,017 times and I do not plan on stopping.
there is no way this has 1.4billion views in one day and only 7k comments and 69k likes. at least cheat in convincing ways
All jokes aside, this would be a really cool update if they actually integrated it
1.4 billion views what
The fact that this got more views than "Never Gonna Give You Up" in just 1 day is insane.
How did 1/6 of the planet see this?
Sorry guys, all those views are me. This video speaks so many volumes, I’m so emotional.
Love that discord can reach out to 1/8th of the entire population in under 24 hours to inform them of their new great feature called lootboxes!
LMFAOOOO
1 BILION!!?!!?!?!?!?!??!?!?
But why would this actually be really cool???
This video has 1.4 B views but despite this I haven't seen it once until someone brought up the fact
Nah, a View-Like Ratio of about 20.000 : 1 is actually insane

1/8th of the world population has now watched the video in under 24 hours
Siiiiick 😎
let this surpass baby shark, no one wants that as a #1 viewed video anyway
if discord did this with a 8 minute+ video, they would be swimming in 10s of millions of dollars a day from just 1 youtube video
Despacito view count is *nervous* ;D
Little do people know, this is NOT a view bot.. instead it is a great marketing scheme developed by the American government to fund gambling! mhm
1.4 billion views beat that mrbeast :)

Discord: “Ha that was such a great prank, haha yeah totally.   *whispers to internal marketing team* Delay the actual release and play it off as a April fools prank or YouTube’s going to prohibit all use of their embedded videos and destroy us.”
Lol, well this is funny. Imagine if this keeps going and becomes the most viewed YouTube video ever, that would be hilarious. Or at least make Top 10 or something, Baby Shark does have like double digit billions right now.

For those curious somebody made this into an ad so that’s why it has so few likes and comments compared to views, it’s a trend on some other videos such as an xbox ad for pubg with 87m  Also they accidentally created a viewbot for this so that added a shed ton of views as well
WTF
1,000,000,000 Views In 1 Day?
YouTube would probably take action but let's enjoy every moment of it :)

I wanna see how much money discord made off this video...

628M in 21 hours is crazy
Greatest world record I’ve ever seen
curious how much adsense money this video made for this channel
lol
The best viewbot of all time just dropped
Ultimate April Fools joke haha
My question is, do they still make ad revenue off of all the botted views. If so, it's extremely scummy  also wouldn't surprise me if it's illegal
April Fool's!!
We were all here for this. Love it
This broke MrBeast's record for the most views in 24 hours 😅
amazing
Speedrun 1B views %any

Can't believe we have a discord loot box before GTA 6
I can’t believe I only heard about this through Mogul Mail lol
Stupid viewbot
ooooooooooooofffff
bro got 628M views in 20 hours
52k likes 600M views makes sense
What Discord actually meant (not as a joke): "Ads are here".

The viewbotting is INSANE
wtf
Box
Damn
Wow, thats many bot views

How did this video break the GTA VI trailer wtf
How do i open in Android??? Which option i updated discord
Why so many view
This is absolutely going to smash the most views in 24 hours stat. We still have 4 hours to go. 😆  I wonder if Mr. Beast et al will just ignore it ("Most views in 24 hours other than that Discord view bot one").
Most viewed video in 24 hours
i loved wasting my class time doing this to get clown is the best
:)
Wow no way real 600m view cop 👁️🐒💀⁉️🤡👻🛑🤡🤡🤡
Discord making the craziest viewbot for april fools:

Happy April Fools, YouTube! - probably Discord 😆
Gta 6 got bitten 😂😂

Almost 700 million views?? Good god April wasn’t fooling around
The way this has become an even bigger April fool prank then they could've imagined.  600M and it still hasnt been a full day yet!

The social media team after accidentally getting half a billion views on an April fools joke:  👁️👄👁️
Nah bro 😂
Lmao
I think this video so popular😅
when you realize the ad revenue generated from this video is enough to pay for discord servers for a few months
628mil views in a day is crazyyy
Discord accidentally viewbotting itself is the best april fools joke i've seen this year
Bruh we got a discord loot box video making more views then GTA6 before GTA6
thats a lotta views
Loot!
The fact it’s not even viewbotted too is crazy
628M views in 18 hrs. Are you kidding me!!

Why does this have more views than GTA 6" the most anticipated game ever" obviously not
628Mil Views..
goddamn, 628m views is just...wha-
this sucks
its no longer gaining infinite views unfortunately :(
ludwig party
This is gonna be a huge impetus for viewbotting "prevention" by Google. Who knows how much money creators are gonna lose.
Wow this video is incredible! Deserves the views
GTA 6: 183M Discord announces loot boxes: 628M
There goes the most viewed video in 24 hours
best part is they also pranked themselves, even the high up devs didn't know why it was getting so many views so fast
How the hell does this jave 638 million in 18 hours
My goal it to break 200k subscribers this year which won’t be easy 💪💯
There’s no way discord get more views than GTA 6 trailer 😂
Plz discord permanent🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
W view bot

Hahah
crushed the most views in 24 hours with their accidental view bot
discord casually angered youtube as an april fools joke 💀
Holy cow when did this get 600 million views??
This has to be the number 1 world record on youtube
Mfw discord view bots their channel
why does the link only bring me to a blank screen on discord
im on pc but im dont have loot boxes

the bigger joke is them accidentally leaking how many users they have active on their platform
Imagine accidently making 630m views in 1day
628m views in 17hrs thts crazy!!
HOW TF IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET 628M IN 17 HOURS
god, yes
violated youtube by adding gambling into a chat app

628m views
is it removed? i just get a gray screen
This has more views than the GTAVI trailer😂
Primeiro de abril foi ontem seus bobão
how did bro get 600 million views in 17 hours 😭
The fact that this video currently has OVER 630 MILLION VIEWS under a span of 18 hours is honestly fascinating
Since we're so popular here rn, how about changing back to old UI?
Best part is that Discord is probably not going to face any consequences for this because they're a corporation and they're subject to different rules than we are I guess
clown
Discord Single-handedly murdered BTS Video [the most viewed in 24 hrs before]
Discord broke YouTube algorithms! 👇police call button
i was too late :(
628 million views is crazy
what are these views lmao
But I forgive you, the clown border is fire.
I can't believe there was 600 million views inside my lootbox
Of course this video has over 600 million views, everyone loves loot boxes right?
this video is cool! Imma send it to all my friends!
cool
we got a discord making a YT view bot before GTA VI
WE GAMBLING WITH THIS ONE🔥🔥🗣🗣
I was wondering how would this work
GTA 6 ❌️ Mr beast squid game ❌️ BTS ❌️ Discord loot boxes ✅️
why does this have 628M views
Wow
I don't have any loot boxes anyway..
Thanks, Discord!
"Oh, it was a joke," she said, putting down a large rock
Mr. Beast is shaking and crying seeing the views this video got in less than a day.
628 MILLION VIEWS WHAT THE ACTUAL FK
You guys are not gta 6
Bro there's no way discord loot boxes are real in fortnite.  Also why does this video have 600m views? Oh wait I think discord is using viewbots.  Edit: This video has now surpassed 1 billion views in less than a week. That's absolutely insane.
600 mil views in 17 hours is crazy 💀
what to do,if i can't get loot boxes?
630 M views 💀 this is gonna beat some world records
We need this promo for Blackpinks next comeback
How did this video get half a billion views in 17 hours
628.7M views with 45k likes. Seems like Discord using viewbot 💀
628M views with 40k likes lmao
IT BECAME THE MOST VIEWED VIDEO ON THE DISCORD CHANNEL BY FAR
best prank ever
Lol, I watched this video about 20 minutes after the release of loot boxes and then went to bed. Then there weren’t even 100,000 views, what happened!!?
congratulations discord on the world record for the most views in a single day span Ever
600M views 😭
We got discord viewbots before a good mobile app
I AM HERE

Я стал клоуном бесплатно. Ахуеть
Награда бомбезная, я стал клоуном в прямом смысле
Woohooo gambling! Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Lebron… honey, my pookie bear. I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way you drive into the paint and strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth touch around the rim, and that gorgeous jumpshot. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire. You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the court, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forvever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first left clevenland and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first ring in miami, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2015 was a hard year for us baby, but in 2016 you made history happen. You came back from 3-1 and I couldn't believe it. I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, "CLEVELAND, THIS IS FOR YOU!" Not only have you changed the game of basketball and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious king, Lebron James. 🥰❤️🫶🏽

Discord instead of selling ads services should sell view botting services. Clearly they figured it out
Disliked solely because of the viewbotting.
LMAOOO
Ain’t no way this video got 600M views in half an hour. That might be a YouTube world record.

600 million views in under 12 hours!!! This has beaten the previous record by over 12 times the amount of views.
600 million views in 10 hours 💀💀💀

But does it reach 1 billion before it's fixed 🤨
Best loot box gift in the galaxy.

I like the idea of this to discord! It gets more people involved in some sort of way.

Пол мильярда просмотров 😲😲
waitwaitwait ignore my first comment, i did the math for the view rate with an image 5 minutes ago and an image now, 5 minutes ago it was at 543M views, and now the video is currently sitting at around 570M views. THAT IS A RATE OF ≈24 MILLION VIEWS EVERY 5 MINUTES. it will only take A DAY for this video to reach a billion views, or in relative time, TWELVE HOURS. if it isn't deleted by this point, it would only take FOURTEEN DAYS to become THE MOST VIEWED VIDEO ON YOUTUBE. WOW.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
took me 25 boxes to get em all, knew it was april fools joke a
*pouet pouet*
is no one gonna talk about how the view count reached 567 MILLION IN 10 HOURS 😭💀

odds are 11% for 9 items. so everyone gets the sdame items?
Just to give anyone wondering an idea, it took me 62 boxes before I finally got the 9th item. The next-least-frequently-received item, I got 5 times.

Absolutely! The pranking knows no bounds when it comes to Fool's April pranks are essential and extremely valued!
Actually hilarious that discord accidentally made a viewbot out of this lmao
That's a lot of loot boxes. How many did you end up opening?
I appreciate the creativity behind this prank, making it seem like an actual feature. It's a clever way to involve the community in an April Fool's joke.

Discord Lootboxes 2024: April Fools joke 2034: Actually gets implemented

'-'
please make them part of the soundboard
This isn't that unbelievable considering they have a dumb store now.
How did this video reach 200m views
why does this have more views than the gta 6 trailer😭💀
QUACK LOOKS LIKE A W
click on the "?" icon next to "inventory" on the loot box page for a little easter egg
it took me 52 boxes
are those views real ?
The issue with this as an April Fool's day joke is that Discord would unironically do this.
POV: You got a discord notification on lootboxes and youre trying to relocate where they are on the discord app (its under your user settings)
im proud that you didnt make a feature that preys on your users! thats a first
bro
just wasted my time...to get a clown avatar... thanks
...

why is no one talking about the view count? 😭
oh god please go away tommorrow
🤡
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Why is there absolutely nothing for mobile
why do this has more views than mr beast in 6 hours,, whaaat?
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Discord is putting ads into the desktop and mobile app next week.  Also I think the reason this has so many views is because they embedded this video somewhere onto the Discord app and everyone who saw it within the app counted as a view.
Ok discord.
219 million views is six hours is actually insane
So…219 MILLION VIEWS IN 6 HOURS?!?!?!?!
thank god its april fools
excuse me. this may be an april fools prank, but WHAT ARE THOSE VIEWS???

the sounds we unlocked should be added to the free soundboard (with the quack and the airhorn) that way they have a purpose after unlocking them all.

This prank truly demonstrated the power of collective virtual imagination and the engaging nature of online communities. It's fascinating how people were able to come together in such a creative way.

This is what happens when you embed an autoplaying, looping video into Discord. It is #1 on trending, and is getting 50 million views per hour. At this rate, this video would reach a billion in less than a day...

It's a limited time clown decoration for your avatar, with the prompt "sorry you wasted time opening lootboxes"
Jesus loves u guys ❤ seek Him with an open heart and mind and you will find Him watch AskCliffe to learn about Christ please and the evidence for Him! tomorrow isnt promised, so please consider Him today  James 4:8  8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

This April Fools joke video might actually overtake the GTA 6 trailer in views. 💀
guys im begging you please bring quick switcher back to discord mobile because its so awful and discord mobile is just so terrible and outdated anymore its only getting worse every update. not everyone uses a computer
just 10 million views per minute? dang, discord really fell off...
bro they literraly prank me
WR most viewed trailer in under 24 hours
The only lootbox is the ad-revenue on this video.
Bro
How tf this get 156million views in 4 hours ? Thats some record or something right
YOU GOT CLOWNED
OR MAYBE YOU WILL FINALLY FIX THE SOUND IN YOUR PROGRAM, BECAUSE THERE IS A FEELING LIKE I HAVE A MICROPHONE FOR A DOLLAR
So do I get to use the stickers are is all just funny ha ha?
MOST VIEWS IN 24 HOURS OH MY GOD
Yooo The best part of gaming is here!
133 millions views already WHAT? it's only been 4 hours since this video was put
OMG
ПАЦАНЫ Я ПОСРАЛ
133m views in 4 hours? Discord fell off
133 million views in 4 hrs?
this video had inflated veiws somehow, it only has 18k likes despite having 130 million veiws, how did they do that
i have 0 Loot Boxes
*Thank god this was April Foopls.* Discord Loot Box, I don't want to Imagine It xd [Also like the clowned decoration. Wouldn't mind holding It forever for free ;yyyyyyyyyy xD]
133m en 4h, ni el GTA 6 XD
what dose these stickers do
134M in 4hrs is crazy  edit: 5 minutes later its at 166M edit 2: 181M in next 2 mins....
If I see a vid that comes out today, I know it’s for April fools
133M in 4 hrs
I did it and... Well done, Discord. Well done.
How dare u
To be honest, I think it would be cool if the boxes were actually a real addition to Discord, and in them you could earn "stickers" to put on your profile (similar to what you can earn in them like the Final Fantasy Sword or the Ocarina that references Ocarina of Time), and if you were lucky you could win customizations for your profile.
the valorant cosmetics are for april fools as well right?
It took me at least two whole seconds to remember what today was.
116 mil???
Atleast it wasn't a rick roll
I think as long as they stay free, this is fun little way to add new stickers to discord that are universal. OR to introduce stickers with sounds. Either way, all the little sfx and sprites were nice. I know it was supposed to be a meme, but the audio and visuals were great.
tf do they do? do they cost money? what do they give me? why did you do this?
116million!!!!
i got a decoration for my avatar this is the reward for got all the loots
🤡
poto
I cannot stress this enough...  DO NOT GET RID OF THIS FEATURE! I WANT MORE USELESS STUFF LIKE THIS!

april foolks .
45,500,000th lootbox for me
why when i open one it doesnt show me nothing ?
The funny part is, who would have thought a chat app would add PREMIUM png overlays! Jokes on you..   Talk about lacking self awareness. I literally exited out of that pop up, thinking it was just another of the 5 pop ups ive gotten in the last 2 weeks about some cheesy new $9 overlay.
😮😮
time for a new gambling addiction
I WANT MY CLOOWN WIG PLEASE
i loved this event

2035: Come on this is my 26 Loot Box and I need NITRO
how can I purchase the pfp decoration permanently, PLEASE DISCORD
Just what I needed.
The irony in making this "joke" after charging $15 for a Valorant icon decoration........
Skill issue
i didnt think it was worth doing until i saw the reward for having 3 of each, thanks discord!
The thing is that this is something discord would 100% do and think it's a good idea
Discord Lootboxes 2024: April Fools joke 2034: Actually gets implemented
wtf
What is the point of Loot Boxes?
why was this so fun?
How does this have a lot of views? At least they are free! 😅

Обновление на года друзья, спасибо вам огромное, я так об этом мечтал! Так мечтал!
Update for the year friends, thank you so much, I dreamed about this so much!

Esta bueno que metan estas cosas a Discord, es como una manera para darle mas exclusividad a tu cuenta.
wow
Okay but what do they do
discord loot boxes before gta 6 is crazy
How
wtf even are these used for
SO COOL
مافهمت وش فايدتها بالضبط؟
I actually got the Lootboxes in the Discord app rn.  I don't even know what the point of it is 😭 A joke?
what is this (im new in discord)
90% of gamblers quit before they win big, never forget.
are the boxes free to open or do you need to pay?
Jeez.
As an australian, im loving this April  Fools prank, thanks discord ❤
Дискорд ты чё творишь нахуй?! Это ROFLS!
alguien que hable español
was this music made by MDK?
The chances are all 11% its possible
My friend didn’t receive his loot boxes
Forgot it was April Fools day, just kinda figured this would be they next unnecessary featured added to get weebs and eboys/egirls to spend more money
Lootboxy które będzie się dało w przyszłości kupić 😅
the opening animation doesnt work for me. just a blank screen with a little diamond shape in the middle
we got discord loot boxes before gta 6
What do these things even do?
is this april fools?
But what do they actually do? I'm so confused as to what I'm actually supposed to do with the drops
Can they be used as an entrance sound to a call though?🤔
Now I'm a clown on discord too!  edit: my friends joined
gambling update
we got discord loot boxes before gta 6 insane
Why.
Yeah, the fact that I accepted this as another Discord Thing, and I was quite ready to delete Discord after being active since 2017, is quite the tell-tale sign of where Discord is as a company right now.
My question is, after opening 9 of them because I was bored.. *ARE THEY FREE?* Because if you charge me 5bucks a pop for these I'm taking you to court, because it states nowhere on the boxes, or in the menus if they're free or not.
i think the ''open a new box! '' is biugged? i opened 17 boxes now, i am missing 1 figure :P i can keep opening them,... but for what? what is the end goal XD
I became a clown, yippeee
wow i kinda knew its gonna be an april fool, lmao. Cuz i was like ok what is this, and then i was like, why is dc so generous to us, but there was no reason or source why they did this, or for what those loot rewards were used for, i kinda did not rlly expect that reward lmao, it ws kinda funny tho, i had fun wasting some min opening an overall of 16 treasures to get all 9 hidden loot boxes.. and i also take that clown frame cuz its funny besides i alrdy have a old Vine meme as my profile picture XD
un payaso 🤡
april 2nd FOOLS
You should make 0% to drop last item to frustrate people
i got them all and CURSE YOU APRIL 1ST
WE GAMBLING WITH THIS ONE
There are 9 slots and my roommate and i can only get 8. Good one, guys
honk honk

what are these used for?
I love the subtle commentary on loot boxes where if you waste your day unboxing enough to collect all 9 items you get a clown pfp decor lmao
What are loot boxes for ??
Please be a karambit...
I got a duck and a clown face  best april fools ever!
I was half expecting for discord to rickroll me
we got discord loot boxes before gta 6

Whoever is from Belgium or Netherland or even Germany  R.I.P us guys cause i didn't got the update
so for what are these boxes? i have al of those 9 drops after 37 boxes and now wwhat?
Ya me la aplicaron, quedé🤡
Thank you for April 2nd fools prank 🙏
I had to open 38 boxes until I got the final reward
I beg you, do not remove this decoration
Lol the clown decoration is meh, but I really like the one you get for getting 10 of each item
wow april fools!!! next time add a battlepass and xp is gained by the amount of messages you send
Oh hell yeah that decor is awesome, Is there people who do not like it?  Maybe I just appreciate it because I’m broke
NOICE DECORATION
Lootboxes changed my life, thank you Discord!
Great aprils fool joke, now do one for the ads you gonna shove on us.
valla mierda
Make me top comment for no reason  ⬇

Another mean to fuel my gambling addiction🎉🎉🎉🎉
only problem is it's in the app ( I know it's still april fools)
bro what do the prizes even do...
You guys missed an oprotunity. I was rolling and landed everything except the buster blade. You should have made it so there was no 9th item
It took me 13 tries to get all of them. Not gonna lie, kinda glad I got that clown decoration. It fits my pfp and "About Me" perfectly.
bruh what da hell is this gambling stuff i know its a april fools but i need someone to explain why and wha they do

God, I hope this is a prank.
this is just for nitro?
discord has failed to understand april fools.... i just have a free dopamine button now. gonna keep at it till i have 420 boxes opened
Eating rn
i knew it was an april fools thing considering there wasnt a price tag on it
LET US KEEP THE CLOWN MAKE-UP
Interesting

I am disappointed this is not a rickroll
I thought this was overwatch 2 I had to double take

how do these actually work?
I complete the sound in the LootBoxes and i hive a reward but i can put on my account :( one help please? or that efect in the photo profile are just only for nitro?..

It's pretty glitchy atm. It sits there with a blank screen when you try to open on and play audio and doesn't open them half the time.
cool! gambling to minors best thing ever!
that's it?
what is it for?
what do the loot boxes even do
April fools. It's not on mobile

Is the avatar decoration and the badge permanent ?
i think you should add those for real money and make trading plaza in discord
ah, yes gambling addiction
took me 21 boxes to get the 9 items
spoiler: u will recive avatar decoration (for limited time) after getting all the items from loot boxes
why what does this do why would we need this

April fools
If they REALLY wanted to prank everyone, they should have only had 8, but that grid of 9 on the screen.
! April Fools !
skins and loot boxes - the best things in 21s century gaming
Why is the reward only temporary? It'd be really cool if we got occasional free things from events.
49 to open all
Who else got clown decor?
can i please stop getting banana i opened 80 boxes and i got banana 39 times please
a clown decoration
I got it in 25
I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't a joke

So what are these for?
what the hell is even this
"Why would we ever bring Loot Boxes into a chat app" Just look at your store page and ask that again.
Really?
I LOVE GAMBLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I‘m on mobile and I haven’t got anything
Bruh... Not the clown April fools joke...
I'm so confused what this is, I've just been opening boxes non stop, what are these stickers and can I even use them?
I got a plushie, now what?
gambling finna go crazy
Why would you ever bring ads into a chat app?
Bro it is April first.
Darn you, Discord! I guess I'm moving somewhere else...
our worst nightmare of actual loot boxes in a chat app is actually just a fun joke, my respect Discord
Я стал лудиком
😄😄😄
you added a subscription to the "chat app" whats stopping you from adding loot boxes
Finally i can gamble
idk but its not a joke i got it on my discord now
you got clowned, sorry for wasting your time opening lootboxes, my grandma had even better tastier jokes on 1 april.
the call sound remix was actually cool i wish it would be real so you can change call sounds or have them random
anyone else not able to get one of the loots?
I got every thing from the boxes. Screw you discord you wasted my time. (Im sitting on a couch with my cat)
I love the free animation you get, thanks discord!
I just opened all 9 loot boxes
The sad part is that this is believable
So what
i like how the loot represents games in a way, so the hammer is Kirby, the blade is cloud final fantasy, the bananas is Dk, the shell is koopa from mario, the shoes is sonic, the ocarina is zelda and i think the duck is brim from Valorant (since they are doing a sponsership. Maybe or im just delusional lmao
this was true months ago so is real, discord is very hungry like supercell and EA for money
man this app is dogshit
Para que servem?
Should've made it nitro exclusive if you wanted it to be realistic
Clowned
W April fools
ايه فايدته؟
i cant get number 4, is this april fools
😠😠😠😠
B A N A N A  🗣🗣🗣

So they'll go out of their way to do this for april fools but still fail to reply to support messages.

приниложение залупа пофиксите пж

awful timing considering this is like a few days after news broke out that discord is going to start running ads in the app
I cannot wait to be chatting on discord while I get flashed with more notifications but this time a lootbox landing on my head
With where Discord has been headed, it didnt seem too farfetched.

we are doomed.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE

When discord 2 launch?
what are this?
oh... and what's that?

I just received a cute stuffed animal. Thanks Discord.
gotta say i like the sound the ocarina makes, got all of them after just opening 18 loot boxes so it wasn´t that much of a waste of time i also do like the dialouge regarding the winning chances.
Lmao. I love that it gives a clown flair. XD It was actually fun opening them at no cost and seeing the cute designs. XDDD
we dont even get to keep it lmao
Why?
Discord loot boxes before GTA6
Best lootboxes ever cuz they free

Hey discord can you help me with my account?

Не работает ссылка(
But ya bringing ads to Discord lol
okay but I was actually cranking loot boxes like a divorced dad with a house in foreclosure. I closed the loot box page and it never came back, I need it, please. IS THERE NO JOY IN THIS COLD DARK WORLD WITHOUT MY SWEET SWEET LOOT BOXES I CANNOT GO ON.
it'd be really funny if they fixed the mobile ui but it's just an april fools joke
we got loot box on discord before gta6
requirement: Discord nitro
Discord directly hinted to us that we are clowns😢
How does this video have more likes than views (for me)
Is it only me, or there is no lootboxes in settings and the link doesn't work?
I actually opened some
bruh i can't open the link, it just shows a open page
That's a good one
what is left up down left up down???!!!
I guess it's gone already?
why did you remove it I didn’t have time to knock out the last one(((
this would have been funnier 5 years ago  edit: discord accidentally making the MOAB of viewbots is the funniest f*cking thing i think to come out of this app in its lifetime how did this happen
AMAZING
banana
Nice to see Discord are spending the money we pour into them with Nitro etc well. What a complete waste of time and money I say. What a Croc! That time and money could of gone into something worth while and meaningful. Like fix your onboarding channel problems and turn opt in to opt out on all channels. C'Mon guys... its been over a year
I found 9/9 of them and I closed the settings, and it dissappeared before I could get the loot! :(
Please help me! My lootboxes are missing and I can't even access them by link.
Please let us keep the clown frame! I wouldn't mind being a permanent clown
early gang 👇

ok but I actually want this. Like emotes and stuff, with rare ones in a loot box format that refreshes daily that sounds like fun XD
beleşmi
I got a clown decoration bro😭
the reward you get when you claim all the rewards is crazy thanks discord!
I don't get it. Am I boomer?
what the hell is this for
DISCORD!!! YOU'RE THE BEST!!!
u r clowns
It may not be much, but you made me smile. Thank you for always being there and telling me that I am the best! (Just don't tell anyone about it!) :D  edit: However, I take back my words! After opening 20 cases, you're pissed that I'm so unlucky! xD  edit2: They apologized to me! 🤦‍♂😅  edit.... I keep opening chests even though I know I won't win... Why does the world work this way?
Does this mean i can get a blackice?
Why is the decoration for a limited time?? Are you afraid that I actually gonna like the decoration and gonna keep it for free? XD
I just got april fooled
Are anyone else's loot boxes not loading?
rickrolled us 😑
Soy ese

спасибо за клоуна😁😁😁😋😋🥰
happy aprail fools boys
discord gambling for april fools, lets go
What do they do and why do I have an infinite amount of them
lmfaowhy did i need to get all nine this si so dumb lol
pls make avatar decoration permanent
april fools who cares im spending all my time getting all 9 rewards
Prima aprilis...
SPOILER ALERT:     You gain the Clowned Appearance when obtaining all 9 lootboxes, But hey! At least you have a soundboard that no one else can hear...
bro it calls you a clown :(
ok
Hey Discord, this should actually be a thing! Give lootboxes out for free on special days like ur guys birthday or also sell them. they can include cosmetics for ur profile.
I realized what day it was at the end and got a sigh of relief cuz uhm loot boxes are illegal in the Netherlands
huh
somebody get NTTS on here bro
Very funny discord -_- XD
the screen goes black when you hit opena and nothing happens
why the items are nintendo alike?
we got lootboxes in discord before GTA 6
why most of them Nintendo related tho?
i don't funny.
does everyone got the clown decoration
Ok lol this got me pretty good, although ngl this was pretty fun, should be a feature ofc a lil tweaking to make it so it isnt infinite uses per day ofc but still ngl it is fun
gambling addiction
nah man im not supporting company mostly owned by tencent
april fool joke by Discord lol
what do they do?
nice so im a clown
Got scammed so hard 🤡
I-I-I got a gambling addiction :3
but  what is it for
Do those on the legal team have the power to put more buttons?
Its on discord
lol
gg
The funny thing about this is, that it wouldn't even surprise people at this point if it was real💀
knowing Nintendo your botta be sued for copyright claims
they put more effort into this advert than the mobile UI💀
foren kinda sique wit it ngl
I though this was gonna happen fr, lol.  Would actually be a good idea considering the decorations you can currently buy with irl money if you could earn points for being active that you can then spend on the lootboxes to get a random item for free that you would have otherwise had to pay for.
i open 100 box where secret?
April Fish ...
kaka fart
mükemmel bir güncelleme olmuş beğendim!

Bro it took me 1 minute to complete
Look, all we want is the "Linux - Screen Share Sound Support" bug to be fixed. It's been 3 years. It has nearly 2,000 upvotes.  Micro-transactions are nice, but if the app won't work for Steam deck, why bother making useless stuff like this?
Discord gambling before GTA6 is crazy
I'm a clow , for a limited of time 🤡
we got discord loot boxes before GTA VI
we got discord loot boxes before gta 6
дословно: "дайте денег"

whata re the loot boxes
почему?
what can you get from this?
Its impossible to get every item
Nooooooo
I actually think they should do these lootboxes though, i think it could give people a chance to get profile accessories for free.
...no entendi nada, q es esto???
I would like to save this icon(
ah yes this is embedded into the app... Great job this year Discord, so much better than just sound packs :)
Yay im a clown
what do these lootboxes do?
thanks for the clown decoration
I streamed opening these on kick and got clowned as a reward.... ty Disco for the amazing experience to be laughed at live. LOL
OHHHHHH BANANA
Honestly though, joking about enshitification like this around the same day you announce ads feels gross. Get some self awareness and maintain your platform before joking about predatory monetization.
can’t wait for ntts to look at this
so... why?
Русский коммент? Что может выпасть? Мне маска клоуна выпала
todo biennnnnn
so we got discord lootboxes before overwatch brings lootboxes back...
Sandwciehs>!>!
🤡
1 April troll nice xDDDDDDDDDDDDD

I think Discord is trying to be satirical with the lootbox thing but with the way the app itself is actually monetized it really isn't.
only for nitro users
Epic
Nice one Discord

Like only  the people who got the reward
🤡🤡
do we unlock the special reward permanently or temporary only ?
thank you dear discord uwu

Discord Lootboxes 2024: April Fools joke 2034: Actually gets implemented
nice discord u rly fooled me
I GOT ALL NINE AND CLAIMED THE REWARD :D
Thanks for the clown decoration ig
To those wondering, collecting all nine loot boxes gives you a clown avatar decoration. You can claim it in your settings under clips. There's an entirely new section. I had to go onto the desktop (website) to roll my lootboxes. You have infinite rolls.
Discord battle pass
