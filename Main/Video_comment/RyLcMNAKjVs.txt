Hi I haven’t watched any of your content for a few years. Loved you both on Strictly. Please don’t think I am being rude but Joe please ditch the moustache and the dark hair. You are only 30 not 50! You looked so much nicer before 👍🏽
Oh my got she sleep with make up on. Grose
Loved it
The decorations Joe did look so romantic and beautiful!
Please someone tell joe smashing pumpkins is already a very famous band 😂😭
I watch the cheesy films me they make me laugh cause you know the ending already but there just so good
No classic christmas films on Netflix, you say? I've watched The Holiday at least 5 times this year (so far) 😂😂
To Joe and Family have a wonderful and blessed Christmas and a peaceful New Year. From South Africa
Lovely couple. Happy Christmas Guys. And Happy Christmas to all of Joe’s followers 🎅🏻🤶🏻🎄
Maybe you have some deers around? Here, in Poland, we do take our pumpkins to the forest (after Halloween), so all the animals, especially the deers, can enjoy them:)
Smashing pumpkins is already a band!! Weird intuition there Joe!
that janette manrara how dos she walk and dance in them tall louboutins
Dianne laughing just after waking up and winning is incredible!
Only joe x diane can have a game called sock on the ledge lol
Get rid of facial hair makes you look scruffy.
Great job on the lights and garland!!
"smashing pumpkins, that would be a good name for a band" *there is a band called smashing pumpkins*
Joe, that is beautiful!
?? No Christmas films...Disney plus has all the films 🙂
Take it down Joe take down the stash
That smashing pumpkins joke got me 😂
I am guessing the gift you can’t show on camera that you had custom made is marijuana paraphernalia
well done lovely job x
Joe says Narnia, Dianne says America and that’s why they are a perfect match 😄🥰
I have seen squirrels do that to pumpkins, they just want the seeds. If you have deer, they will eat the outside part .
The sock on the ledge part was so funny 😆
11:56 SO pretty & festive 😭
You two are becoming my fav YouTubers
7:55 *well someones been shot*  But in other news...... My pumpkin  🤣🤣🤣
Good job joe it looks beautiful x
i vote go mustache only!
Ps the lights & greenery are lovely 🎄🌟🎄
I didn’t twig that it was a narrow ledge, assumed it was the top of a wardrobe!
I bought (randomly, online) & watched Christmas Story set in Finland about a young orphaned boy (Nicholas). It was really lovely and is going to be one of my annual Xmas must-see DVDs 💖🎄💖
They have been together for nearly 3 years now. THESE TWO!!!!!!
14:28 sounds like the beginning of Spice Girls Wannabe :)
Shave it off completely!
Well done both of you! Joe for the fabulous decorating & Diane for winning Sock on the ledge!
It's stunning
I need a ledge to throw socks at 🤗. Great job with the decorating beautiful, really transformed the dining area. Stay safe stay well xx
The best things are always the simple things , the beam garden , the sock shelf , you dont need to be rich to be happy just each other .
Totally agree with your opinion on the xmas film. I thought exactly the same thing when I looked at netflix for something christmassy to watch x
It looks beautiful Joe x happy Christmas to you both
Absolutely love you guys!!!P.S Dianne where is your Dirty Dancing t-shirt from???❤️❤️❤️
“More importantly, I think Dianne is going to love this”  OUCH YOU TWO 😍
The Leonardo DiCaprio and and Dwayne Johnson pillows are hilarious 😂
These two. It's a lovely thing.
Joe (and Dot) look up "A street cat named Bob" will ya?  it is SUCH a wonderful & Xmasy feel-good movie - based on a real story!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Diane! 😊😘
Such a nice Christmas suprise :)
Your decorations look great 😃
I agree Joe. We've got Virgin full package,Now TV,Prime and Netflix. There's nothing great on the Christmas films apart from Elf and It's a wonderful life. Where's The Santa Clause Trilogy etc ? 🤷🏼‍♀️
So cool , the table would look class in the middle 🌟🌙✨⭐️
Watch the Christmas chronicles.  My fav new film.
Joe that looks amazing! I can imagine sitting there at night with a cheeseboard and a glass of wine 🍷 such a vibe! 😍
Smashing Pumpkins is a band 😂. An American rock band
Looks beautiful joe
I thought the exact same with the christmas films! I was really struggling to find a classic one yesterday
Definitely rats 🐀!! Dianne is sounding more English than ever! X
Great job Joesph
What do you mean no good Christmas films!? Arthur Christmas on Netflix, Home Alome and The Santa Claus movies on Disney.... idk if the UK version of Netflix and Disney have those but normally the NZ ones don't have much at all ahahaha
We watched “click and collect” last night, it was so good. It’s a comedy but super funny!! (On Netflix) ❤️😂
You are a gd man:)
Omg Di kills me😂🥰...Wakes up half asleep and absolutely BOSHES sock on the ledge🤌🏼😂
Dianne is just amazing 🤩 love her so much! 😂 🧦
Thatching skills coming into use on that greenery ;)
That shriek Dianne let out after winning “sock on a ledge” is literally me when I beat my husband at anything! 🤣
Kitchen looks amazing!! You invented new game sock on the shelves! You both are so fun and bringing the christmas spirit  alive!
those beam decorations look stunning! very magical looking
How to wake up Dianne: mention sock on the ledge 😂😂
