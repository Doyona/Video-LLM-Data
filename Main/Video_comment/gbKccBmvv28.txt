What was that stupid guy yelling at 2:31? 🤨
Watching this from rehab right now hits different.
Who's here in 2025
So hppy great  Dean Ambrose is back😘😂😂😂🎉❤❤❤
Still one of the greatest promos in AEW
easily the best version of mox.
"It's great to see John Moxley back where he belongs." Yeah, the indies.
i only watch this version of moxley rn.
I'm going to a meeting tonight. I must be stronger. Thank you Mox.
He used to look so good when he had hairs, he should transplant his hairs
I can't stress how much I miss this Jon Moxley over Death Riders Jon Moxley.
Damn he looked good when he came in in 4 years it changed him doing these hardcore stuff but gotta respect him
Must have been hanging out with the drug addicted bank robber to have had a dream like that.
I'm coming back after being expelled 3 days for fighting
One of the coolest dudes in pro wrestling
This Mox was so fucking generational bruh
3 years and 4 world titles later.
Back when Mox was good
These words get under your skin. Impressive man, love him.
Wrestling is truly at its best when it makes you feel something
This promo gave me chills. Laying everything out there, not being afraid to talk about those demons addiction comes with, Mox is a fucking superstar and hero.
"I'M THIRSTY" !!!  sent me to the fucking grave.   Goddamnit he is the best.
When I saw this live I cried - best promo ever for my money
Dean Ambrose in AEW😂
This promo, the crowd... goosebumps every time
Back when AEW had a full crowd looking at this and comparing to the nost recent episode is funny as hell glad jon sorted his problems out
JEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN      MOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXLEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
That entrance 😂
Jon Moxley should be a motivational speaker when he retires. This promo was mint.
I love watching this promo, he really is one of the best.
He was about to armbar that dude😂😂
The Heart and The Soul of AEW Is Back
Moxley: I don't run from demons, I just beat the shit out of them!  Me: Fair enough!
Mox is we’re he belongs he was made for this
I started getting sober 2 weeks after this promo. Been a journey, and I'm in a good place thanks to the love and support of my friends and family. This is my first Dry January. Thank you, Mox!
i used this promo to kick my own alcohol addiction and im 1 year/5 months clean to the day.. still comeback to this from time to time just cause it had that much an impact on me, plus seeing him back leaner and meaner gave me the motivation to get it together... best choice i ever made thank you moxley. anyone in same position just keep fighting it does get better eventually just keep pushing for greatness!
Have to say was a alcoholic and a druggy at this time an i'm happy to say that i'm 100% sober
5:37 Best part of Jon Moxley's legend line ever.
2:31😂😂
My maternal grandpa started drinking in the mid 1960s. He was dead by the middle of 1982. He never got to get help,so I'm glad Moxley did.
2:29 A hater talking trash to Jon Moxley and here’s how he responds to this. 😂
What did the guy in the crowd say?
He thinks he's SO badass. Pathetic.
JON MOXLEY ALL THE BEST
Goddamn his theme song is awful🤢🤮
I watched this video months ago when I became an alcohol addict. This was a time when I didn't know that I was an addict but yes things had started falling down around me. But I used to keep watching this video just because of his now famous lines "I beat the shit out of them".  Months later, when everything actually fell in my life with my addiction reaching out to my Dad as well. I've been sober for the past 20 and half days (today, is my 21st day, oh that magical life changing 21st day). I had hit rockbottom on 30th July, the last night I ever drank so far. I still feel like drinking, but I'm abstaining from it. I won't say alcohol has killed me, but it's me who screwed myself. Today, there could be 1000 possible reasonings from my side, numerous attempts to quit before the rockbottom disappeared, but here I'm, embarking towards my 21st day and beyond.  All these months right from the time I was drinking till the time I've become "sober", I've come across many examples of alcohol addicts, but Moxley is the first guy whom I looked upto all these months followed by Eddie Guerrero, Jake "The Snake" Roberts and Scott Hall. I don't know how long I'll be sober, I don't when will my life become appear better. I've got resources and family support via my Dad but I've lost many people thorough the 200+ days out of 270 days of solo drinking journey. I just want to be the best version of myself hereafter. I got many chances to get my act straight, but this is the final chance I have and I'll hold onto it like it's my death. And I'll make sure to become the best individual for myself.   Back in 2021 when I read about Moxley entering rehab, I didn't have any idea about alcohol addiction (as I didn't used to drink much back then), even when he came back last year at the time of this video, I didn't know how tough his battle. That much disconnected I was from wrestling despite being a fan of the wrestling product since 2002 as a 5 year old kid.  Thank you Moxley for going through hell and coming out! Thank you Eddie Guerrero for going through hell and showing that life can definitely be good once you get kicked out, but also when you don't restart your life from the bottom of the ladder. Thank you Dad for believing me and giving me chance to get myself to my best. But also, I'm sorry for dragging you in this phase.
Ooh Renee you lucky gal
It's generally a bad idea to pay to go to a show and heckle a guy who's paid to speak on a microphone.  It's even worse when you do it and the crowd will cheer your ass getting thrown out.
How I haven’t listened to this promo, amazing speech.
Damn, looking back it this now, he was right! Jon Moxley was THE MAN in AEW for 2022 on and off screen.
JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON MOXLEYYYYYY!!!
There are only two people for which I have seen the crowd go quiet in respect for them First was the Undertaker and now Jon Moxley What a legend❤
Nothing gets me fucking fired up like a mox promo holy shit
Only MOXLEY rules
We all make mistakes we all have demons it’s how you fight those demons because black clouds demons leave when they realize there’s nothing they can take from you to make you lose. Scars are scars
This Promo inspired me to finally get sober, and now I have a mission to thank Moxley in person. He's been my hero since the CZW days. Absolute fucking legend. Thank you Mox.
Moxley walks gaye as hell
unbelievable promo.
JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN MAAAAAAAAAAAXLEEEEEEEEEY
He woke up from a bad dream . But then realized he's still in that bad dream.... Called AEW.
When Mox says he’s the heart and soul of AEW, I believe him. Promos like this are all the proof you need.
No Moxley No AEW
“These days, all I drink is blood!” is an absolute all timer of a line
God of promo
Wild one is the greatest of all time 💝💝
Gotta love the guys who try and trash talk and the wrestler can literally single that person out
This guy has more passion in this business than I've ever seen
"And if they laugh, then f*** 'em all" - Halsey
Every now and then, I get down...but then, I see something like this.  This was a great night, and a great promo.  Thanks Mox.
Wild one do your thing   it is so nice to see you back   you are so handsome and beautiful man 😍   I love you Dean 🥰🥰
Dc is pure trash cesspool and sjws, Morley is cringe af
Do that beautiful walk 💕 love you
Welcome back Jon glad to see you love you
Honestly, he gave this promo, and there was no way he’d be world champion in 2022 at the time. Then it became time to be a legend.
2022 was truly Jon Moxley's year. He rose to every occasion, every time CM Punk got injured or lost his brain, Jon Moxley was there to lift AEW up on his shoulders and carry it to a new level.
Thank You Mox-ley, Thank You Mox-ley
Is he still with his renee
Everyone is quiet when Mox is on the Mic because,of the amount of respect we have for him.
You could hear a rat fart...he makes the huge crowd go DEAD silent. Nothing but respect for Jon Moxley. The heart and soul of AEW and Professional Wrestling.
Some fans were worried about Mox recently. I came back here, to have a look on his face (some people told he looked too tired and his skin was reddish) and I can tell you I'm pretty sure he's doing fine (again I am not telling this is a 100% fact). Dude's just gettin older everyday just like everybody, I guess, and remember : he may be quite tired, cuz pro-wrestling is hard shit for a human body to handle. Even if his demons came back to challenge him once again, we should support Mox, that's a looong road to travel, and doing it alone is even more challenging.
5:55 he told us.
I come back to this every time I need a reminder from where I was.
It’s November 2022 ,he ain’t lie
This is absolutely why I love Jon moxly, an absolute legend and a badass man.
All Elite Wokism.
Can anyone tell me at 2:30 what did that fan says exactly?
Moxley, moxley, moxley, moxley 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Mox is from my hometown and I'm so proud to have him represent AEW as it's main face. My mom is dental hygienist and she cleaned his mom's teeth around the time The Shield had turned babyface. I hope to meet him one day and tell him that story.
This man is the heart and soul of professional wrestling
Face . Heel. Moxley
0:42 he absolutely YEETED that Bottle :P
2:26 some guy was booing at Jon Moxley and talking trash at him.
"I don't run from demons I beat the shit out of them!"🔥
Wish my uncle had done this. Good for moxley, this isn't easy.
5:55  "I'm gonna grab the world of professional wrestling by the balls" - Jon Moxley  We're halfway through August and Mox has already delivered a legendary year:  The promo with Danielson that both were smart enough to realise had something special, which led to calling an audible that eventually gave us Blackpool Combat Club.  Two matches against Wheeler Yuta, pre- and post-forming BCC, showcasing the younger star's evolution and truly making a new star.  Matches across indies like GCW, Revolver, and DEFY against the likes of Homicide(!), Tom Lawlor, Speedball Mike Bailey, Tony Deppen, Blake Christian, and just this weekend defending the GCW World Championship against EFFY (Mox should've lost.)  Fifteen tag/multi-man matches with BCC, CM Punk, reunited Switchblades with Sami Callihan, and Hiroshi gotdamn Tanahashi.  The huge Anarchy in the Arena and Blood & Guts matches.  Winning the AEW World Championship by defeating Hiroshi gotdamn Tanahashi and proceeding to defend it in banger after banger against Brody King, Konosuke Takeshita, RUSH, Ol' Mance Warner, and Chris Jericho in probably his best match since joining AEW.
“…These days ALL I DRINK IS BLOOD!!!” Ahh freaking G.O.A.T. level promo!!!
no lies found here
Why he chnage his name
Jon Moxley is my favorite pro wrestler of all time. When I feel down/sad due to some circumstances, I like to come back to this masterpiece of a promo because it always makes me feel better and motivates me to keep fighting and to never quit. Thanks for everything, MOX!
I can litterally see the difference between dean Ambrose and jon moxley
And now he's world champion again, congrats Mox
Pretty boring stuff. You need a lobotomy to enjoy Moxley's deranged babble.
2:34 😂😂😂
Absolutely masterful promo right from the heart
To this very moment I hold on to every word in this promo. I battle demons everyday….especially dealing with the fakes….who tried to write me out. It’s very very relatable. Hell at this point. So rewatching this….is what I needed. Because at the end it’s a reminder to myself. I’m me…fuckin love it…or hate it.
Moxley could seriously be a top guy in any promotion if booked right! Great in-ring wrestler, amazing look, one of the best, rawest promos in the game, a great champion, great storylines. The total package!!
2:34 hell yeah
If Moxley can beat his demons so can Jeff. So can anyone that has demons
Best wrestling rn ❤️🐐
Jim Ross is brilliant.
Not only he drinks blood but he got blood on his face at "Forbidden door" 7:03
Mox is an inspiration to everyone suffering with health & issues etc. Whatta top guy!
legend
I've been putting off watching my first aew vid for a while, and its good to hear that Dean- Jon Moxley is doing well. As well as good ol' J.R. Gonna watch this vid then check out some cm punk aew stuff. Great to be here y'all.
Jon Moxley is a Legend 🔥
what happened to dean Ambrose
what did the guy said
I miss the old Dean ambrose
I fucking love this promo
Dead silence. This man got dead silence while he spoke. This is an amazing promo
Deaaaaaàaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan Ambrose
Moxley is the reason for aew is alive
We want dean ambrose come back
2:34
I like how he keeps it 💯
"I hate this fucking song."  - Rachel Phelps  I've posted that a few times tonight, and I don't know or care if people got the reference this time.   This reply is not about me. It's about Moxley. He got clean, he conquered his demons, and he came back. He got up, fought through it all, and he CAME BACK.  I stand for Moxley, and anyone out there who struggle to make it through, who want or need a helping hand...Moxley stands for you, and so do I.
"Our scars can destroy us. But if we survive them, they can transform us. They can give us the power to endure and the strength to fight." - The Batman 2022
what did that guy say 2:29
Dean Ambrose ,?
The sort of promo you cite in Mt Rushmore discussions ❤️
Ive watch him for a long time and hes always been entertaing
I still dont like the beard
mox is back mr. 4 time mox
<3
It doesn't matter what name you recognize him as, the fact is he's overcome his demons. Truly an inspiration
You are lunatic Frenc dean ambrose not jon moxley
I fucking love this man. I’m sober and I’m glad he is too. He will always be my favorite.
Mox is the Promo, and the Way, and the Fight.
What did that heckler say?
Only legends call him dean Ambrose
go dean aka jon moxley
MOXLEY MOXLEY....
This planet doesn't need this many humans
"This is me"! Amen!
I haven't watched wrestling in years and years, but I've fallen down a rabbit hole on YouTube watching this cat. After watching his story, I think I see WWEs biggest problem. The fact they have to be so family friendly due to being a publicly owned company is a huge detriment. Wrestling doesn't have to be edgy all the time to be good, but some characters should be. This dude could be one of my favorite wrestlers ever! Again, I'm not really a wrestling fan, but RVD is probably my all time favorite. It seems I like the ones who are basically playing a version of themselves, just turned up a few notches.
Me when someone tried to be disrespectful at 2:34
MOX THANKS FOR GIVING ME INSPIRATION TO GET CLEAN XX
Lol he looks like hes trying to be Triple H in this vid  from how he actually looks too his demeanour.
AEW에서 브록레스너 영입하는것도 괜찮을것 같습니다. 브록레스너 영입 추진 요청하는바입니다.
He looks smaller than before
I love how this isn’t even his character he was legit talking about his battle with alcoholism that’s why that speech was so heartfelt and real because it was real such an moving speech I started watching AEW cause of Mox gotta love the determination he has 💯
jon moxley always gd
Dean ambros
I'm sorry but I only like to call him Dean Ambrose.
He is Dean Ambrose. I'm i right? Anyone tell me please
They say he is the closets to stone cold, I don't see it. Stone cold didn't have to try be the persona, he was the persona. Mox forces it. I want a Austin like character.. Damn it Austin
Wow 1/3 shield
From Dean Ambrose To Jon Moxley So Amazing. We will always miss you lunatic french 😭😭😭😭
So what is his real name? Jon moxley or dean ambrose?
What a reception awesome.
Yes dudes so awesome, I really hope he becomes the man over cm punks lame ass.
Dean I here u bro
I like Jon moxley and Chris jericho
2:31 that guy in crowd who was yelling must have been Jim Cornette.
Even I don't know aew before dean enter.
The last perfect person was crucified
Dean
He will always be Dean Ambrose to me as well as Jon Moxley
This promo got moral lesson lol
0:15 Cena!!!
I don't watch AEW but its so great that John got pushed in this company cause he kicks ass against Seth and Roman, wrestling and microphone wise.
Jon moxley is the stone cold Steve Austin of this generation
Jon effin' Moxley, man.
what did the person in the crowd say to Moxley?
I’m sorry, But Jon Moxley will always be Dean Ambrose too me. I miss you Dean😢…But then again..Jon Moxley RULESS!!!
I don't think jon is belongs to aew but moxley belong where he started and where he belongs
this is dean ambrose wtff
Man hearing them calling him other name than Dean ambrose is weird
Mannnnn i am here becouse of Platinum Max! Didn't watched Wrestling for 15 years.
dean ambrose or jon moxley. he's still the same lunatic fringe we all love
Thank you for sharing your story, Jon! I took my last drink 3 weeks ago. Almost died from it twice. I failed at sobriey the first time but gonna try my best to win the battle this time around.
I love when they sing his song
DJEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON MOOOOOOOOOXLEEEEEEEEEEY
AEW is starting to look like an embarrassment to be involved in, PPV show having lower viewers than a regular smackdown episode.   Dead ass silent crowd for a return.
What if the guy who said that got hit by moxley's water bottle
What did the fan yell at Moxley?? I couldn't hear him
I comeback here sometimes when I need that passion to start my day
I needed this. Thank you mox you are truly free
No one realize this dean ambrose?
Im glad Moxley is back to doing what he loves to do.
Glad to see Dean Ambrose back!
Man I miss his character as dean ambrose
AMBROSE! JUST AMBROSE PLEASE!
he will always be dean ambrose
It's dean armose
EVERYONE MY 7 YEAR OLD COUSIN HAS A CRUSH ON STING UNDERTAKER AND AJ STYLES
He doesn’t belong there
ك
Dean ambros ❤️
not to start a flame war with other promotions but i like how near 2 months later i can watch this clip and the only thing that is censored is the F word, no editing it out the jerk in the crowd, no pretending it didn't exist, no piped in crowd noise to cover anything.
We want Ambrose back
Dean 💕❤ ever From india
Moxley home will always be AEW. We love you Mox 🙌👐
yall know thats dean ambrose?
Anyone spot the guy with the arsenal jersey
The last time i saw a crowd so silent cause of respect in a promo, was a promo from the undertaker.  Dude just entered next level.
What do here dean Ambrose?
dean Ambrose🙁🙃😭😔
Now That is what you call a promo. Welcome back Mox.
Jon moxley el mejor 👌👌
Jon Moxley is such an inspiration and I hope he  never turns heel he is the best babyface AEW has on their roster😁❤🧡💛💚💙💜💖
He looks like dean ambrose
At ah boy jon
What did that fan say to him to tell him to get kicked out
Dean ambrose.. now jon moxley.. different name.. but still same character.. comedian.. still not finding the right character..  lol
Super Jon Moxley
You could’ve heard a pin drop. That’s how silent it was
Can we just take a second to say thank you to Justin Roberts? He has done so much to hype up the name of Jon Moxley to the legendary status it is🤘🏻🤘🏻
Not a single "What" chant ❤
Wow, amazing
I love how the crowd went silent when he started talking. Respect ✊
5:31 5:38 is the right thing to say to all the doubters hell yeah mox
He said some true stuff in the  promo. But that was messed up you kicked that one fan out we still have the freedom of speech right or is that gone
Pure class
What was that guy saying it must have been pretty bad I've never heard Moxley talk to a fan like that before
Mox just reawakened my inner self i kept closed back in 2019
so what did the guy in the back said?
Oh come on. You just ejected a fan because he called you trash? Wow.
Wellcome back baby
I’d call this a promo but it was more of one of the most uplifting things I’d seen from a professional wrestler. Seemed unscripted. Nothing but Mox beating the shit out of a demon and tellin it like it is.
yooo dean ambrose!!
Ladies and gentlemen JEEEEOOOOOOOONNNNNN MOOOXLEEEEEEHHH
Is he dean ambrose?
Dean Ambrose
Demons are evil, demons are bad, demons are vicious, the demon whom woke moxley up this time is for a hell of ride!! My hero has is back!!!
His voice has changed so much unlike his brothers Seth and roman
Inspiration 💯🔥
Why do they not put the belt on this dude, he's our Austin 3:16 in the woke era
Not a promo, not a gimmick. The silence amongst the crowd, although mentioned already here, still needs to be continuously acknowledged. The silence of the crowd outside of their applause is literally breathtaking.  The most motivating, relatable and inspiring message in pro wrestling history. And it arrived in 2022, not in the 80s, 90s, early 2000s...but 20 f'n 22. Much love. From the top to the bottom of my heart, thank you for this.
Imagine him teaming up with DARBY ALLIN bro  2 badasses that'll stick together to destroy everyone
👌😎
Dean Ambrose
Just give him that AEW title already.
Now that is showing Tremendous amount  of respect complete silence like who is doing that these days absolutely no one AEW fans are just on another level
what did that one guy yell out at the start ? anyone knows ? i didnt get that fully
"I don't run from my demons. I beat the shit out of them!"  My goodness that was beautiful.
Dean Ambrose
Who are you Mr. Mox? There was a person i use to know as Dean Ambrose the lunatic fringe.
this is definitely legendary promos the return of Jon Moxley!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥! I don’t run from demons! I beat the shit out of them!
People have a lot of faith in a carny to get off the pills. I have a feeling we haven't seen the end of bloated tomato Dean. He needs the pills to get through the pain of wrestling, and he probably thinks that the fentanyl laced batch that almost killed him was an anomaly.
But that’s dean ambrose
Dean amrose😙
Pure passion
JoNmoxLeY👋🏻
JoNmoxLeY
Moxley will be the future legend version of "Stone Cold "
he is fire on mic i get motivation from his speech and voice..
Welcome back knoxley kick some ass
Let me clear you something. Pls fucking change his theme song. It's very dumb.
Welcome back from. Cork irelsnd
I have a drug problem
He is Dean Ambrose
That's how you make a promo with a Lifestory.... So inspired... Wow
I think we can all free he has adhd
Overrated cringe
Ohh..so happy to see him back
This guy clearly needs professional help. Looks like he might have CTE.
I don't want jon moxly i want dean ambrose💞😘💞
This warmed my heart. Video of the year.
Just saying Adam Cole vs Jon Moxley would smack
Listen I don't usually watch AeW ...but when it comes to Jon Moxley formerly known as Dean Ambeose is the realist ,its like hes speaking for all us weirdos and freaks alike lmao but my respect for him is at an all time high I must meet this man in person one of these days ...had a back to back funeral for my grandmother and great grandmother it really.....Jon really cheered me up with this powerful message and reminded me who I am as a man as person ...as a human being  .
I cant wait until he relapses
I dont run frim demons i just beat the shiy out of them Thank YOU JON tHANK you AEW i have fight to the alcoholism for too long and this is so inspiring to me
Will always be dean Ambrose to me 🥲
This could've been the best promo of all time
Are he Dean ambros
Its bean amdorse
Jon Moxley's return > Ronda Rousey's return
Demons stay for a lifetime and it's a lot of work. They come back but I pray he stay sober
Hey brother we can make this more better we can make this story more better we can make this entrance more better we can make this episode more better we can make this show more better because we can make the Word we said more better we can make this thing more better we have to work we have to think and it can be more better it’s not bad but we can make this more better we can think how to introduce our players we can think how to show or player we can think how to see or player it can be more better just trust me and just see what can be more better just give me a chance we can be more better.
“JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNN moxley” lmao 😂

Dean embrose
It ain't AEW without Mox... welcome back!
I watching this aew match after long time for moxley
The shield❤️
I missed Dean Ambrose :(
Overrated af!
When I see an IG model’s photo: 6:53
Is this the promo that cornette was having a bitch fit over saying he was going to get em kicked off tv 1. They beeped the f word 2. You can say shit on tv now that's not a big deal nothing in this promo was that bad I thought it's a awesome promo
0:09 Best part Justin Roberts
Bootleg stone cold...cornball
Wrestling is backkk
That person don't need any ring.
Sober Moxley is dangerous enough to make a prime Stone Cold Steve Austin feel some fear.  This promo was a masterpiece. It’s fucking awesome to see Mox back and healthy as hell. I’m 100% on board with his pilgrimage across the business. Welcome back Mox.
Dean
He's gonna have his relapses with alcohol but hopefully he beats it
Call him what yu want i know him by dean ambrose
"I don't run from demons, I beat the living shit out of 'em." Jon Moxley
Steps to enjoy perfeclty Jon Moxley's entrance: Step 1: Stand up  Step 2: *WILD THING!* Step 3: *YOU MAKE MY HEART SING* (Optional): Keep singing Step 4: HIDE! Cover your head or bring protection (Optional): Stay away from the barricade
mox will return in the rumble mark my words
This is what Dean Ambrose should have been, but Vince wasn't interested and wanted to push Roman Reigns
Moxley is back with great promo
why did he change his name from dean ambrose
Big pop but this the first time I can hear the fan sayin something.  Now Google the Rock returns or Stone Cold
Who’s here wanting Dean Ambrose back
2:25 what the hell did that guy say that pissed Mox off so bad?
The dude was clearly still on something. His speech was a tad slurred and his train of thought was blurry.
Always been corny & a Douchebag. Get that fan outta here, walk around the ring with a Richard Simmons strut and chewing gum like a petulant child like he did something. I just watched the video to hear the fans comment lol
Who miss dean Ambrose
Isn't this dean ambrose huh 🙄
he looks fantastic and in great health
Am I the only one that can't get over saying dean ambrose😅
Moxley and Cody….. sorry I fell asleep.
If the FTW title isn’t going to Dante Martin (which it probably isn’t), give it to Mox. Nobody in AEW embodies that kind of title like him
He carries any company he is with, like the greatest of yesteryear! Need to try Sam K. version of wildthing!
Fuckin luv Jon Moxley
I think I’m going to rehab and this man is why
What did the guy in crowd say to get kicked out?
Anyone who buys this fake tough guy act is even dumber than Moxley
Plot twist: The fan was a plant.
demon? the fiend confirmed
Ladies and gentlemen…JYYYYYYAAAANNNNNNNNNN MUUUXXXLEYYYY…Justin Roberts…..whatatool
The shield really was the future of wrestling and now all 3 members are in the peak of their careers
Fuckin' a
Where can I get that leather jacket from??
(just for men) should sponsor this promo
Good to see mox back in good health best wishes to his family
These days all I drink is blood😱😱😱
6:05 started to sound like triple h lol when he got mad or hyped up the crowd for DX and that
anyone know what the fan actually said to him?
He's loss a little bit of mass
Jon is captivating in everything he does!
I LOVE JON MOXLY ( DEAN AMBROSE)
Buh buh can kiss my drax ass  -Dave
AEW is so dead without Moxley
0:09 JEEYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON MOXLEY!
Did he get a hairtransplant?
Anyone else hear him turn into Enzo Amore every 20 seconds or so
“All I drink is blood” damn. Not me getting chills over here. Couldn’t be me
What did that audience member yell? I heard something about trash an streets? Or strap off the freak?
Mad respect to him for admitting he needed help and proud that he went and got it! Welcome back Mox!
mox gives me eddie brock vibes from venom
Awesome
That dude is the crowd said booo get this piece of trash out of the ring😂😂😂😂
What was the guy yelling at the beginning?
This promo is HEAT!! Vintage Wrestling feel
F*cking love AEW. Mox all the way baby 🔥🔥🔥
All is good until the bell rings he just doesn't  wrestlers anymore! I hope bd gets some wrestling out of him in the ring !!!
Looking better than ever! Congratulations on the come back, Mox!
Jon Moxley is the s***stain on the underwear of life.
Moxley always has the coolest Jackets
That Dean ambrose 🙀
Aew= jon mox
as much as i don't like his matches, promo was pretty decent and helped me kinda feel better about what I've been going thru, cause it's one of the things society would rip you apart for having issues with so i don't get any treatment or help for it even though i probably should even for physical health reasons
Anyone else rewind to hear him say go F@*k yourself
Jyaaaaaaaaaaaaaan Moxley!!!!
Mox is awesome, but i think his entrance theme should be a lil bit more hardcore than that, maybe an evil sounding metalcore track would be cool.
I would like to see Jon Moxley vs Adam Cole
Thin skinned Joan can't handle audience criticism?
5:51 same as Jeff Hardy promo
The fan that said that about Jon Moxley in the crowd actually sounded like Bully Ray, when he did that ooooo that's what bully Ray usually does and throws his hand up in the air.  It so sounds like Bully Ray 🤣🤣
Mox will be missed
Dean ambross❤
i was there! maryland and dc is almost always a great crowd to be apart of and participate in!
What a waste . Why not make that a surprise . Aew is like a large karaoke event . 💩
Tatti poonj it yeah 💯
I’ve cried every time I’ve watched this
Man it felt great hearing Wild Thing again
Dean Ambrose.
My fav of all time💟💟💟💟💟
Thank you mox you just gave me chills . Mox is BACK YOU ALL
aew reminds me of attitude era and ruthless aggression era
Isn’t that dean ambrose
Jon Moxley owes alcoholics an apology. Because he came out and acted like it takes 3 months and realization to overcome alcoholism... it's not. It's a lifetime battle that will haunt you and battle you forever. He is legit acting like a 3 month rehabber, that swell of anger, pride and confidence... but he has no idea how hard it is. Good luck Mr. Mox, welcome to the lifetime struggle...
AMBROSE aka Jon Moxley smile to see u back jp from Suva fiji Islands
Still looks like he’s on drugs
The man is from my hometown!! Mad respect for your hard work coming back
That is one of the worst wrestling promos in the history of the business.
Dean Ambrose is back
What was that douchbag in the crowd shouting? He's been saying some stupid things all show long.
Man has Mox gotten fantastic on the Mic. Not to try and mention his roots, but every guy from the Shield right now is in prime form, but you could argue the most evolved and polished is Mox. He's only going to get better.
Umm.. anyone can explain what's this about? Moxley beat the demon? I don't understand 😅
This promo sucks
What a joke
2:33 What this guy says?
Moxley, Punk, Bryan, Cole... these guys look like they are living their best lives in AEW. The feeling/aura or whatever you want to call it is different than in the past. I been to many AEW live shows and it's palpable. The crowd in those buildings are electric in major cities AEW runs.
That promo was fucking masterpiece
Jon has the swagger of a man trying to be cool.
JR kicking Cancer’s ass and now Moxley kicking his demons ass!
imagine the shield is back together
I just watched a fart in church.  Glad to see Jonathan Good take steps to get his life in order.  The character "Jon Moxley" is a joke.  Everything about him seems faker than a $3 bill to me.  Just my opinion.
Shout out to security for not throwing out the guy Dean ambrose cursed at what. Imagine being a wrestler and getting feelings hurt over a chant lmao fake fighting
I always thought this version of wild thing would make an awesome wrestling entrance theme
I know the demon he's talking about. "The nerve of you to get away with all that" hit's really hard.
Am I the only one who can’t stand Justin Roberts as ring announcer?  His name is not Gggggggg-ooooon.  It’s Jon!
Fart master
Attention :- HE NEVER FORGOT SHIELD'S ENTRANCE 😍❤️
omg its him  HIT IT!
Applause to jon mox
They are listening… Wow, no chants, no background idiots… they listen to him… ✊
Im in a battle that i think im gonna lose! I never realised he came back but if i do make it! This man saved me! Im struggling! X
Jon v Cm punk
he is Dean Ambrose
Awesome video
What utter BS. This is not wrestling. This is total trash, garbage. John Moxley? A totally stupid character. Might as well go back to diva pillow fights.
"So nobody...no matter who you are, nobody should be afraid to stand up in front of the whole world and bare it all! Everything that makes you the person that you are, scars and all, and say 'Hey, this is me!'"  Well, look what happened to the guy that tried doing that just two minutes earlier...
Dean Ambrose
Mox will always be one of the greatest
Acknowledge your  travel cheap Roman Reigns.  Aew SUCKS!!!
What did that guy shout?
What happened to Jon Moxley and what's the demon that he is talking about?
ITS NOT JON MOXLEY ITS DEAN AMBROSE
So Glad to See Jon Back, and Looking Good. We Love You ❤  Jon!  Welcome Back, Bro!
Melted that 🎤
Well come back
"I am. I was. I am not. I never am. I am never less his friend than when he is with me and when I seem most his friend. He is the king of liars. He is the frankest truthsayer. He is the august companion with whom one walks with the gods. He is also in league with the Noseless One. His way leads to truth naked, and to death. He gives clear vision, and muddy dreams. He is the enemy of life, and the teacher of wisdom beyond life's wisdom. He is a red-handed killer, and he slays youth."  Love u Mox
Wonder what Jon Moxley classifies as "hell" exactly. Getting too drunk in his 5 million dollar house? Possibly drunk dialing some rich friends? I think his version of "hell" would probably be laughed at by most addicts & alcoholics... If not they would at least laugh at his silly "tough guy" walk and demeanor
2:31 what did the guy say?
Johnathan Good was talking. Not Jon Moxley. & That's okay. 🖤
To join the ride
Welcome back moxley and it’s so good to see you again I’m ready
Not jon moxley he is dean Ambrose
I'm glad to see you back Jon Moxley.
He looks noticeably better here. If you look at his last appearance before he left, he was bloated and his skin was red and blotchy. I’m so glad he took accountability and got himself better.
The name might have changed. Different company. But  it's still the same mid card  Dean Ambrose. Who thinks he's a bad ass now. 🤣
Hate the way this guy pronounces John Ggeeeeaaaannnn 😆😆
MOXLEY 💕💕💕💕💕💕
I wonder, how much money this companies waste on microphones
Man you could hear a pin drop in that crowd. What respect!👍🏻
Overrated wannabe
what did that 1 fan say to mox?
I legitimately tested up watching this promo. The passion Mox has is unmatched!!
Dean ambrose is back
Dean Ambrose
Why is this guy trying to be Rick Vaughn
He looked way more intimidating when he was all red and bloated.
I'm sorry but the number one moment of the week was Sting jumping through the table. Period
Each line hit like a hurricane.... Somebody gotta put some beats to this to make it more gangsta rap performance....yooo
Welcome Back Jon Moxley
How stupid is this guy to drop the F-bomb on national TV I'll be interested to see if he still has a job although I do like aew and I've enjoyed moxley's matches that was a bonehead move LOL
And people thought he'll back in 2022 royal rumble
I need to see Jon Moxley vs Roman again. Y hope this time Moxley kick her ass.....
Amen my brother
The trouble is he doesn't look like a bad ass. He looks like a normal bloke who if he gave you the big I am as he did at the end of his promo you would just back hand the cu*t and put him back in his box
Wtf is Dean Ambrose doing here? Sorry just got back at wrestling contents after years
My love is back welcome back dear 😘
You did it Jon, now we're waiting for Jeff to win.  Go ahead guys!
Even back in the shield days, everyone and there MOMs knew that moxley was the best promo of that group
That swagger walk 🚶‍♂️ He's definitely  back Welcome back Mox
"All I drink is blood!" I'd love to see a vampire gimmick
Let’s go Moxley Let’s go Moxley
Mox is bad azz but when did wrestlers start feeling so offended by some mark in the crowd calling them bad names that they yell out for security to kick them out of the building? That was a bad look for moxley. Unfortunately he's not the only wrestler acting dead cringe these days.  Get some thicker skin gentlemen......
Wild thing is bad for him
Anybody know what th'guy that got thrown out say?
Our boy is back.💪🏻⚫
This has to be one of the greatest promos of all time. It was real authentic. Powerful, inspiring. I had goosebumps. Welcome back Jon
Dean Ambrose 2.0
These days, all I drink is blood.... fucking great line
Amazing comeback promo glad mox is heathy now
Ambrose is back 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gcw world champion
i can listen to this man all day long
One day at a time Mox
All I Drink is BLOOD.........So fucking determinated
0:09 i love you justin roberts
Am proud of you, thank you for your advice
Dean Ambrose!
Can't wait to see this man in the rumble
Moxley is WWE'S Justin Gaethje
When he said I don't run from demons I beat the shit out of them. Hit the soul deep
Give him Shitlist back cmon.
I am huge Moxley Fan
In my opinion, Malakai black vs mox can be one hell of a rivalry!
The Lunatic Fridge is BACK!!!
Yes 👍 He looks healthy
What the dude say to make mox say get him outta here
I am glad he clarified “there is no hell (in this ring) that can be put upon me. If he ain’t give his life to Jesus at any point before he is departure if this earth they he’ll he thought and demons he symbolized will be a reality. There ain’t no wrestling out of that one. Glad your doing better Mox let’s move to some real strength and not a self willed one.
That heckler at the beginning must be a demon not funny as George Clooney says you cannot get always be with being a dick anymore nobody was laughing enjoying the heckler
Mox for president un leader too
Is that Dean Ambrose
is this dean ambrose
Imagine being as badass as Jon moxley.
I’ll be damned!! With all that weight loss, he looks lean & healthy.
Mox is looking 10 years younger 😍
I wonder if his former Shield bros Reigns and Rollins supported him while he was in rehab.
He looks good! Welcome back!!!!  Pls come back to NJPW again !!! It’s great G1 run you had.  Moxley, Punk, Kenny and on and on. So many talents.
Dean Ambrose walks weird and so funny
"ALL I DRINK IS BLOOD!" holy shit mox is insane...IN THE BEST FUCKING WAY
This was no promo, this was a TED Talk.
Willcome back champion
glad hes back tbh
This isn't a Promo. This is him telling us his story. His battle.
I've just never been a fan of him. Congrats on his comeback and what he's overcome, but he just puts too much into his attitude. Like the head swaying and shit. Acting like a tough mid schooler lol
Mox looks fit.. and healthy. So good to see him back.
That's a real fighter right there. Moxley looks healthier than ever, Welcome back!
He came in like a warrior !!! He’s a champ bro fr fr I hope everyone looks up to him he’s such a good ass person!
I love moxley!! So happy he beat his demons! I LOVED HIM AS DEAN AMBROSE! And I LOVE him as John moxley!! GO MOXLEY!! Love u man! GOD BLESS!!!!!
These days iam  drinking blood!!
What a legend
This sucks
Beast!!!!!! Best thing in wrestling today!!!!!!
Thank you Jon Moxley. Truly inspirational.
Moxley vs Danielson is going to be nuts.
I feel inspired. I wasn’t ever the biggest fan of this dude, but he’s probably gonna have me giving AEW a shot
He drinks blood????
AEW fans are better than WWE's fans. Might be a smaller size but cheers and various emotions are raw and uncut,very much like the in ring competitors.
Is this not Dean Ambrose
i bet he shows up at the royal rumble
Welcome back Mox!!! We missed you! You are an inspiration and by far, one of the most badass men in the business today. Hands down!
Amazing and inspiring promo. Glad to have you back Mox.
I think Mox telling that guy to leave was a bitch move. Deal with it. Wtf. I think just saying stfu would of been it.
I have rated him to be the best performer there is right now but he then goes on and participates in absolute garbage matches and feuds. Has a great promo, fantastic intensity, just needs to stop lowering himself to the whims of these indi freaks who have absolutely no talent. Should be in the world title scene.
So great
Bully Ray was wrong; Jon doesn’t owe anyone an apology. All Jon owes is a Paradigm Shift to Bully Ray. On a lighter note: welcome back, Moxley. You look fantastic.
Sounds like he is still drunk.
Stay healthy. That's all that really matters.
"Nowadays, all I drink is blood"  That's a good line jonny boy.
Miss the old dean ambrose😔
Yahh!  Wild thing Baby!! Sorry Seth Sorry Roman you got nothing on violent Mox!!!
No one's going to say what an amazing job Justin Robert's did on the introduction?
This guy is a HERO
2:26 "get a garbage truck and get that piece of trash out of the ring."
Dean ambrose 😎😎😎😎😎😎
"All I drink is blood!" Yo, I'm hyped!!!
And that’s the bottom line, cuz Moxley said so.
Moxley is AEW through and through,  have loved him since 2013 and will route for him till the end. He is relatable as ever and always cuts powerful, raw and real promo's.
I am going to get jumped on for this...  Welcome Back "Dean Ambrose"
It's so great to have Jon back
The part where he talked about our imperfection made me sub, really needed to hear that.
That’s a damn good promo because he speaks the truth!
What did that fan say around 2:35 or 2:37
Funny how quiet it is…..this mean AEW only cators to the hardcore fan and not the masses
GOD BLESS EVERYONE AND GOD BLESS JON MOXLEYYYY MANY BLESSINGS AMEN 🙏🏾
Dean abrose
I dont like Mox but the dude looks so freaking good and its great to see him better than ever.
Deep.
I love u
Pro wrestling is real
that’s deep man.
I missed seeing moxely glad he got stuff figured out
Good to see moxley again
Hey mox, are we gonna stop with the damn Indy deathmatch b.s maybe then you wouldn’t have to drink tobull the pain…  DUH
A GOAT in his own right
Go on Mox great speech!!!!
Dean Ambrose
It looks amazing in comparison with the botched wwe`s long awaited return he did (not seth rollin`s fault)
What did the guy in 2:38 say when he was being disrespectful?
Hell Yeah! He is back 🤘🤘🤘
Inspirational man love you I'm really your big fan mox
Plz change his dammm music... This sounds shit... He is a brawler, a tough dude .. and that you give him... He is a hardcore professional wrestler.. not a fuckin playboy 😡😡
That was a whole speech and greatest promo I’ve heard in long time…That’s why I love Moxley
It's great to have you back Mox🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Den
He sounds drunk.
Oh my god was that a promo. AEW hasn't been around long in the grand scheme of things but I've seen some of the best promos I've EVER seen in Professional Wrestling in this promotion. Amazing what creative freedom can do for a company. Wow was that good. And Moxley looks better than I think we've ever seen him physically.
Testify, Brother!
I love how we glorify addicts and crack heads. Beautiful. What a time to be alive. I'm going to the hood to hug a bunch of em right now and tell them to watch this wonderful story.
Fucking wonderful..   hell yeah homie!!!
No one should EVER apologize for getting the help they need.  Bully Ray can go screw himself.  And I hope that dirtbag in the crowd was legit removed.
What i loved most bout this segment.. every one listened.u could hear a pin drop
“I don’t run from demons. I just beat the shit out of them.” That’s one for the ages right there
Kick Some Ass in 2022 Moxly , Glad your back brother 👍
That’s dean ambrose! He looks so good. So proud of him! He didn’t just beat his demons, he kicked the shit out of them!
Wow that’s he’s theme song niceeee haven’t heard that song since Charlie Sheen walked out with it in the movie major league.
I’m glad he is okay and all but this dude is such a corn ball. He walks like a child trying to pretend he tough and all of his promo’s make it seem like he thinks he is some hardcore icon or something. Dude isn’t hardcore at all….. I do like the entrance music though.
I root for him, but man, I can't shake the feeling he came back too soon. I mean he admitted a serious addiction problem and he's back after what? Two months?   He's rich, he's a millionaire, he doesn't need to punch the clock to make ends meet, he can take his time, heal up,  rest, get his mind in order and then come back.   As it is, it appears as if he was somewhat trying to push through it and that never works. I know, because I had and have addiction issues too. It's never this easy. This is not to be a dick, I really empathize with the problem, but I think he will relapse and it won't take that long, you can't admit to yourself a longer addiction problem and then just two months later be "yeah, I've got this shit under control and I'm back".   The wrestling business probably could've affected his addiction, maybe AEW too, or the environment, whatever, it can't be entirely disconnected. So to go back so soon...IDK, I think it's a big risk at best.
really beautiful. great promo.
I love how obvious it is that this man's entire gimmick is "Onita Enters the Tokyo Dome" loll
4:38 the timing couldn’t have been better 😂
This Lunatic runs the Asylum🙂
I don’t understand the demons of drug or alcohol misuse, but have ever iota of respect for those who go through it and are able to come out clean. I have scars from mental health issues so I know a little about the battle people go through. Welcome back Mox
Moxley sucks he should just stay home
He's a fine showman of this business. No wonder why he ranks on top of the mountains...
This is why he is my favorite wrestler welcome home mox
dean ambrose
Hell of a promo from Jon moxley
what  a fucking promo
What kinda scumbag yells at a dude coming out of rehab
The bad seed is back it’s Moxley. Ahhhhhhhhhh
Well said Jon.  5 1/4 yrs. sober from alcohol, pain pills/heroin. Addiction is just one of my many scars. Shine brightly and unapologetically, everyone. 🤘🏼😏💞
Perfect Promo!!! Damn good!
Thank god, he is looking like himself again. 😭
WELCOME BACK MOX 🤘🏻🇩🇪🇺🇸🤘🏻
Welcome back Mox ❤❤
Deen Ambrose
Welcome back
I've been following Jon Moxley since 2012 great to see him back welcome back indeed
Okay man but why is he talking like a preacher?
I would love to See the lunatic fridge and The Charismatic Engima team up
i hope see you to royal rumbleee
I don't run from demons, Finn Balor disagrees....
Moxley vs windham book it !
Love mox
Welcome back MOX
You might as well be teaching HUSTLE LOYALTY and RESPECT!!!!
02:29 what did the heckler said?
glad to see moxley back in shape !
Bully ray is just jealous
GR8 to see Mox back. And my God this scars promo is one for the ages... I've not felt this moved by a promo in forever... perhaps... because it was from the heart.
Idk if they had that planned for the crowd to be so respectfully quiet, but if it wasn’t & they did that on there own, then Bravo. That made his message/promo pack more of a punch then when the crowd cheering after each sentence.
Jiiiyooooon Moxley
Jon Moxley is back
Is it just me, or does that fan in the beginning  seem a little scripted? “I don’t run from demons, I just beat the Shit outta them💪🏼👊🏼”
S-tier promo.
He's kinda look leaner
Moxley! Moxley! Moxley! Moxley!
Hey that's dean Ambrose
Drinking that water
Holy shit this dude's promo skills are on another level he hooked me in
Did Jon get Veneers? His teeth look very good. No criticism if he did. I would if I could afford it.
Jon looks really healthy. I’m happy for him.
Weird. And lame.
No apology? 🤣
Nigga giving me the ambrose vibes
Justin Roberts is one of the best ring announcers in the Wrestling business today
Best Promo! Welcome back Jon Moxley 🔥🔥
Mox as champ again 😀😀
Steve Jobs
Nobody cares about this guy
Best promo I've seen in years. CM Who?
I was moved by this promo.
HDP COMO TE AMO
What did the guy scream at Mox in the beginning?
Lunatic 😎🔥
When he told that guy to go f himself made me feel hype like it's the attitude era all over again
Fun Fact: Indians don’t watch AEW
Inspiring stuff. Great to see such support from the fans as well. 🤘🏻
Welcome back Mox and congratulations on kicking your demons ass!
Some people say Mox should have apologized. For what? He doesn't have a damn thing to apologize for.  Watch and listen, when Mox was talking that crowd was absolutely silent, then they clapped and oh how they fucking cheered this man.  That's what he needs, he doesn't need to apologize.  Hell yeah, Lets go Moxley!
With the shield
He’s no Roman Reigns! Just saying!
Always been a fan of him since he was Dean Ambrose, and im very happy he is back and healthy now!
Return
Still sucks on the mic
Welcome back MOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX...you look gorgeous
2:35 don't mess with a focused mox 😎😎😎
bryan danielson vs jon moxley i feel that would be the perfect feud
We love moxly from Pakistan
Shield Runs  Pro listening 🌟🌟🌟
We all have demons
Why do I feel the urge to run through a wall right now?
Nice..
He’s BACK!
Did the F-Bomb make it to Youtube!?!?
Moxley Returm Aew 🔥
Been Waiting for this to Hit 1M 🌲
Jon moxley must be making friends with Seth and roman
It is incredible to see Moxley this good, happy for him
"These days, all i drink is blood" ...sh* put that on a T-shirt
That heckler got…… *MOX Justice*
What did that fan say?
0:46 I can't be the only one who thought he's gonna throw that bottle into the guys face 💀 glad he didn't tho
"Jeee-On Moxley?"
Wooooooo MOX LEE  its back 🔥🤘🇵🇪
Torna a smackdown
Yes it's great to have him back. Yes it was a great promo. But for me this was more. This promo helps me building the mindset I need to fight my own demons. And I thankful for that. I hope Mox continues to kick his demon's ass and I will do the same.
Welcome back Moxley it is really good to have you back apart of the industry's heart was missing while you were away but now it's all back together.
You aew fans are unbearable 😔
Welcome back, MOX! 👊😎❤💎
Thank you
My brother!!!! He walks through the crowd like the shield did😭
dean ambrose returns
I love how attentive and quiet the crowd was for Jon when he was speaking. Apart from the first dude obviously but he got what he deserved.
Best promo I’ve ever seen in my life
👏👏👏👏
Letting the wrestlers have creative control over their characters has been amazing to see!
Future matches that must happen. 1. Jon moxley vs cm punk 2. Jon moxley vs Adam cole 3. Jon moxley vs malakai black 4. Jon moxley vs daniel bryanson Jon moxley vs hangman page
So glad to see him back! So glad he's worked on himself and made the inner demons tap out. WELCOME BACK MOX!!!
And... so one cares! Indie mudshow bullshit! This gimmick is stale! Maybe he should learn how to work more than one type of match. Also he cant tell security to  remove anyone! Also his rehab shit was an embarrassment! Especially for somthing as small as alcohol... pansy! Also the idiots wearing masks are antiscience woketards! Cringe gimmick, cringe entrance, cringe promo!
Dean ambrose is back
Dean ambrose is back
Ima need to see a Jon Moxley vs CM Punk rivalry
God he is THE aew wrestler
so 'f*ck' is censored but not 'piece of sh*t'?
Are we gonna overlook the fact that he said the f word uncensored live on TBS lol
Wishing you all the best, one day at a time Mox!
If everyone was perfect the world would be boring is str8 fax
Well there are people who fight thier fights and eventually win. then theres jon moxley... making a big egg out of his own weakness. He looks not healthy at all but celebrates like he reached some kind of milestone.  Think about that... Marks.
He will always be Dean Ambrose to me
“I AM TRULY FREE” powerful
Great to see him back ! Healthy and recovered :D Welcome back John
Top 5 promos of all time
Jon moxley made AEW not Jericho,fight me
WILD THING
I'd love it if he makes an appearance at the Royal Rumble but happy he's back on AEW
Huge respect to Jon Moxley 👊🤘
A very true, relatable and inspiring promo by Jon. We all have our demons and its no shame to admit it. And its so good to see him back, healthier and more dangerous than ever! I dont know who his next opponent will be, but i know already that he is in for a ride of pain!
AEW 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 #1
💪💪💪
Rather you have mental health issues or not. This man spoke some true words & very heart felt. I got goosebumps listening to this promo. Well said Mr. Mox
Was never a fan, still not a fan glad he got his life together and did what he had to do for himself and his family.  But meh can still careless about the guys “character” was always overrated I don’t buy into his character and his crazy because he gives the finger and curses his little attempts at twisting and turning his head to seem like a loose cannon is poor attempt at look at me I’m insane.
Welcome back Moxley.
The real AEW champion is back Jon Moxley 🐐🐐
Welcome back Dean Ambrose.
Amazing moment he looks great and healthy welcome back moxley
Moxley segments are the only thing worth watching in aew.
Welcome back Mox
Looks so healthy
Dean Ambrose ForEva ❤️😇❤️😇
Jon vs punk who’s with me
“These modern day wrestlers are absolutely dweebs.” -Conor McGregor
Hey looking healthy mox
These PG dweebs suck and they’ll always be inferior to their predecessors
The fan that got drilled by that water bottle is in the ICU, cancel Jon
This is the best moment in Sports entertainment history!!!
The announcer was freakin' brutal at 0:09!!! Absolutely loved this promo, if we can even call it like this. All props to Jon, it takes a shitload of balls to face our demons and open up to the audience about it. AEW made me interested in pro-wrestling again, and this promo is a great example of why they are growing non-stop. Welcome back, you crazy bastard!
This guy is a clown
John Moxley the best 🔥🔥
Lean mean and Kl--eeean
It's good to see you back Dean Ambrose. Big fan. Watching from Papua New Guinea
A match between Moxley and Callihan would be awesome 👍😎
wow, total silence from the crowd. 😮
Moxley vs punk! In a cage! For aew hard core title!! 'b
Pleased and proud to see him back where he does belong. Welcome back Jon Moxley - here’s the best to you and your family.
Sure what an  achievement been in the FAKE entertainment business
He is without doubt one of the best SOB in the business today and he is back better than ever.
FYI: you don't beat your demons... you just make your ally!
Never really rooted for Mox......until now. I felt that. Promo of the year. I know that dark cloud, lived under it a long time. God didn't open the doors of heaven and let me in, he opened the doors of hell and let me out.
Welcome back, Mox, but your original AEW theme song was much better.
Who else saw the arsenal poster?.. hehehe
"These days, all I drink is blood."   God bless this man.
Jon moxley vs Cm punk please next
This is EPIC!!!
I wish that every man will fight his own demons,like John Moley do.whatever it is.
I always wonder if these guys are actually chewing gum or is the fake gum a nervous habit
did someone start cutting onions when he said he was truly free? stop it
Jon Moxley is the reason why i watch aew
The next hardcore God of wrestling likes of Mick Foley, Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer, Sandman, Sabu and all the hardcore Gods of wrestlers of hardcore. Great to see you again Jon Moxley and I see hells coming with every fight you fight. Who’s ready to step into the square circle and take a hardcore beat down from the one and only Jon Moxley? I want to see violence, blood and gore be spilt.
Jon Moxley should (hear me out) attend the Royal Rumble
Wow im speechless
He looks like a million bucks now. Happy to see him back
No one can make a whole crowd go quite and listen to the story their telling like the one and only like Jon Moxly
Best promo ever!
I was crying is that ok because Im facing my demons?
Moxly I have scar's on my body and mind too you a real boss I will always support and love you moxly....
Dean Ambrose
2021↗️Jon Moxley  2022↙️Dean Ambrose
This promo spoke to me. I ended up in the hospital this week for some mental health issues. Hearing Mox speak from the heart and hearing his emotion in his voice truly hit me. Everyone had demons and scars. They don't make you weak. Thank you!
I’m glad his recovery is going well. He looks great. But I’m not looking forward to seeing any of his garbage wrestling. Sorry
Good on Jon, he looks great, back looking like Dean Ambrose again.
Welcome back John Moxley!! He is stronger than ever in AEW!
There are only two people for which I have seen the crowd go quiet in respect for them First was the Undertaker and now Jon Moxley What a legend❤️
Welcome back Jon Moxley
Welcome Back Jon Moxley
So happy that Jon moxley is back and more looks more dangerous now than ever and always the shield member by far
That heckler was actually accidentally beneficial to his big return, and I'm so fucking happy for Mox to be looking so much better.
I know she doesn't sing the song, but for some reason every time I hear this version of Wild Thing, I always imagine  Renee Pacquette singing it.  It just feels right, you know?
I saw a bit of Dean Ambrose sneaking in to say hi there.
What did that guy yell?
Great to see mox back looking great
Great to see mox back looking great
Amen class!!
Is it bad that I watched this about 5 times in a row and got more happy everytime?
Amazing
looks ten years younger
Whew that man lost alot of weight in rehab. Always good to hear a new father changing his ways for the better.
.
Dean 😎😎😎😎
Great promo
I cried to this . Thank u mox we love u & hope u get over them demons everyday & live a better life as we all should 🤙🏽❤️‍🩹
Funny. He walks normal n as soon as he’s within the crowd. He becomes the Billy bad ass person. The walk changes. Everything. Would hate to see him relapse back into alcohol
I'm glad Scott Hall is back
Glad that they got rid of the heckler, dude was a d-bag
This is the guy who put AEW on the map
touche AEW.
Can someone tell me what that asshole guy said in the crowd?
Run these views up fe
I like a man...❤️❤️❤️moxxxxxx
Did anyone have subtitles on it tried to say jim ross said *The Blue Eyed Bathroom Is In A Fighting Mood* LMFAOOOOOO *BLUE EYED BATHROOM* IM SCREAMINGGG
Well done moxley
Anyone know what the guy said
Hope that fan actually got booted. I had a guy on instagram chirp me for being a Mox fan, went off on how he was a drunk. I get it the internet is off limits, ppl can say what they want but to bash someone for addiction issues is low even for the internet. I hope that guy never has to know the pain of losing someone who lost themselves to alcoholism or drugs
He is a good guy he doesn't give a damn what people think and he will tell you to go shove it if you decide you wanna doubt him
I like the old theme music 😒
No matter what accomplishments Jon Moxley has in the ring, the example he has consciously and courageously tired to set as a human being and wrestler is the most impressive and important thing he will ever do (in public life anyway).   Thanks for going to hell to help yourself and your family, but also showing us what a being a tough guy really is. It means so much.
Great to see him back great to see him get the help he needed talking is a sign of strength and nobody should think it's a weakness.
Man, this was very emotional. This wasn't just a promo, it was one of the best motivation speeches ever given. Stay healthy mentally and emotionally and you can overcome your personal demons.
Great promo
I can’t tell you  How much I waited for this craziness 🔥
The legend returns
2:34 lol
The silence while he talked...dude...wow. It was like the place was empty. I've never seen something like it in wrestling. The amount of respect that Mox has is amazing.
Good to see Mox back in the ring
What did the guy at the start of the promo yell?
Ladies and gentlemen...JIIAAANNNN MOXXXLEY!!!
He is still DEAN AMBROSE for me 🤣🤣🤣
Legend
Sourav gurjar in aew
“These days, All I drink is blood!”   *Me realizing he’s referring to his alcoholism.*  🤯
Thx u aew & welcome back mox
"I don't run from demons, I beat the sh*t out of them" Jon Moxley is a freaking legend at this point
He looks great
JR and Tony on commentary makes every segment even better
Did you know Jon’s hairline is a M for Moxley
The fucking guy is back. My favorite pro wrestler on the planet. Welcome back Jon
Damn he looks toned and lean as hell. Like no shade or anything, but I felt like something was up back in late Oct when he seemed bloated, and kinda looked fatigued and nauseous in the ring. I'm so glad he's back, and I really don't know what kind of shirt he's wearing but damn I want one of those.... 😂😂😂
As someone who has struggled with addiction, this spoke to me. I hope he continues down this path.
Love how slient the crowd when moxley talk which makes it why cooler & huge impact what his talking about
He can’t go heel for a good while now the crowd love him
ROYAL RUMBLE.......... ROYAL RUMBLE.......... ROYAL RUMBLE.......... ROYAL RUMBLE.......... ROYAL RUMBLE.......... ROYAL RUMBLE.......... ROYAL RUMBLE.......... ROYAL RUMBLE.......... ROYAL RUMBLE.......... ROYAL RUMBLE..........  ROYAL RUMBLE..........
He looks completely different without all that inflammation in his body
Waiting for Dean
Like us to win heart's ❤️💞💐
Welcome back Moxley
We missed ya mox, glad you’re healthy.
FINALLY!!!
Man that guy yelling in the beginning truly is a piece of sh*t.. get that guy out of wrestling arenas. Makes me sick
He is the reason why AEW is so great.
جوووووووون مووووكسلي
Lost weight and it looks good on the brother... Healthy and back!!!!
Jon Moxley Will always be my favourite happy that he back at AEW
Good to Mox looking better these days, 2021 looked like a rough year for him and good to see his 2022 is starting off with such a damn good promo.
Jon Moxley is a dope. Never understood his draw. He bounces off the ropes like a mentally challenged goof and is only slightly more believable as a pro wrestler as the Gobbely Gooker.  Sorry not sorry.
The crowd was so silent while he was speaking. CHILLS 🔥🔥
Mox looks great its great to see him back and overcoming his demons let's hope he stays healthy and happy great promo aew are lucky to have him
Aew looks like a more fun place to be for both fans and wrestlers
What this guy has done in the last few months is inspirational.
You're back my idol
Roman Vs jhon moxley
He's so handsome my gosh
He looks great !!
That promo speaks volumes great to see him back and hopefully that message helps someone out there realize you're not alone
This is how you do PROMOS
To steal the words of another one of my favourites. 'Bad times don't last, but bad guys do!'
Overrated
Curious. What did the guy in the audience say? And did they throw him out?
He is now more dean ambrose 😍
Moxley just buried addiction on the mic. What a man, and what a promo. Goosebumps.
Legend 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
No#30 RR 2022
Listen to the emotion in Moxleys voice
Jon moxley vs cm punk 👀it would be great
he looks healthy
Looks like he dropped about 15 years off how he looked.  Good start to '22,
Man I Freakin LOVED THIS
Yeah, that's the kind of Moxley I wanted to see! You look great!! While going for the main title!
King
What did that guy said at 2:31?
He looks fresh and healthy
I AM TRULY FREE!
So extremely happy to see Jon Moxley back.
The pop was big but imagine if he came out with a real entrance theme... 😂 his first AEW theme was so much better than this. Hard rock just suits him so much better
Moment of silence for the one who got hit in the head with a water bottle.
Gil180 BX AEW THAT’S WHATS UP 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😎😎🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷👍🏼👍🏼
What did that fan say before Mox tore him a new one?
he got burnt out. Moxley literally carried AEW with the world title then the cross promotional matches, he was working triple duty. poor guy needed a break. So happy he is back. Hope he eases into it slowly.
WHY does he look like dean ambrose
I'm feeling Dean Ambrose attitude back 🔥
One hell of a promo. Its so good to see that Jon has fought his demons and came out the other side. Welcome back Mox
2018 dean ambrose vibes
He is not jon moxley he is he is our dean Ambrose 😰😭😭😰😔😔
I will always stand with you moxley
Someone tell me what that heckler said?
Dean Ambrose
Dean Ambrose effect 💜
In top 10 top 5 promos of all time???
Love u MOX now I can start watching AEW. I Miss u 😢 Sir.
Look at how he walked, its vring us the Dean "Unstable" Ambrose Vibes Back❤️❤️

Looking good He lost weight
MOX!!!!
Missed a perfectly good opportunity for black to kick his face off and represent the back demon and taunt him.
Moxley punk rivalry please!
Glad to Moxley back proud of him as a man for putting everything aside and handling his demons as a wrestler this was him at his finest there is only one Jon Moxley and in case you forgot he reminded the world
Best Promo Ever
I’m a recovery alcoholic
" I don't run from demons, I beat the shit out of them"  AMAZING 👏
The King has returned.
Aew is shit
Its sad to see what AEW has done to him and the toll it’s taken on him
this segment man, this was straight raw emotion and thoughts. I'm glad to see Jon back and I hope he keeps getting better and better on his road to recovery.
Dean Ambrose
I've seen people saying that he's looking like Ambrose whilst acting like Moxley and damn, if that ain't the best combo we could ask for. Welcome back, Mox!
Almost crying watching that. Jon,  welcome back.
Addiction is a war glad to see him fighting hard to make himself better for himself and his family
Low key mox is spittin
One of the legendary promos Perfectly summed up this mental heath issues
Man crowd was dead silent
All I can say is....man what a promo...wish Vince could understand how good a promo could be when it comes from the heart
YES!!!
All I drink is blood. Iconic.
Thank you Mox. I desperately needed this, you are such a fucking inspiration to me right now
3:02 - 4:08 That silent "Respect"  really shows how much everyone loves him💖
Pro wrestling is going a Revolution touching souls i just wish Hip-Hop can get it together. Just think about that for a awhile watch this prom.
Welcome back, sir. Glad to see you well. Gosh, it’s good to hear him again.
Wow. That's great promo jon
So Happy He's Back In Aew This Guy Deserves The Absolute World So Happy To See Him Healthy And Over His Demons
Baby face promo
This guy is an inspiration
That dude is a real role model right there. Showing the people who struggle with this stuff that you can get through it. A real person going through a real situation.  Much respect and much love. Congrats on your sobriety Jon Moxley and may you prosper in life more now than ever before!
I would like to have his old theme music back
I see the deep state sheep are still wearing mask
I'm so happy for him his such a badass
Great to see MOX back! Glad to see that he’s doing well and taking the fight to his demons as well as anyone who steps in his way. Everyone has their demons they go through in life including me but we fight to live a better and more fruitful life. A wise man once said “Throw away your demons and follow a righteous path and never look back.”
3:58 Dead silence.  Big ups to the AEW fans for keeping quiet and letting Mox talk. I'm sure him throwing that guy out had a bit to do with it, but regardless, mad respect.
He looks like his 2012 self again
"I am truly free!" So much weight to that statement. Welcome back, Mox!
My boy. My fuckin' boy. Let's go!
Awesome to see Mox back. They need to change that entrance music. Does not fit his character
wow.....just wow....
Wow what promo that was excellent
Zzz
Welcome back, Jon Moxley.
Alot of us needed to hear this. Thank you Mox! I hope everyone who hears this is thirsty because i am
Jus don't get it.
Randy, cm punk jon moxley killed their previous demons now it's time for jeff hardy i hope he recovers too
Please make shield
This is what stone cold told DEAN AMBROSE!!! to be way back in the day on that podcast. This is going to be something
🤛👊🤜
Awesome 👍
Whatd that dude yell before Mox told him to shut up??
Yes muy lunátic favorytu
Can someone explain me what “demons” he was fighting?? I genuinely don’t know.
Mox is back love from india
👏👏👏
I thought Ricky Vaughn was coming out.
No apologies to the fans and the wrestling business JUST  THE CLASSIC WE ALL GOT DEMONS CLICHE
GOD TO SEE YOU BACK JON MOXLEY HE HAS BEEN THROUGH A LOT
Man this promo was inspiring. So glad to see Moxley back.
Can i call him Dean Ambrose?
This promo will go down in history as one of the best promos EVER!!
This was amazing. Speechless
Damn, you can hear a pin drip during his promo. The crowd was completely silent, hanging off every word and being respectful.
Nice to see people fans look up to come out with tackling inner demons and mental health. Seems with Pandemic and the media peoples mental health is at an all time low and isn’t talked about. Seeing people like Mox and Fury take the time and come back to show us what happens when you take the right steps to get better is a huge positive influence on people
jon moxley, a true fucking fighter.  welcome home 🙏🏿
Does anyone know what that fan yelled out before he started the promo?
That jeoooooooooooooon moxley i missed that and it felt like music to my ear  I missed moxley and now seeing moxley fit stronger and better i am damn excited about what future holds for this modern day great
Awesome... So Happy he's back! Kick A**!
What a promo!
2:26 you can already hear that one "Fan" Booing on jon
This gave me goosebumps
Moxley didn’t fight his demons they just left him alone he needs to find Christ but y’all wouldn’t understand, majority is too ignorant to see it
Props to whoever is wearing the Type O Negative shirt in the audience
He really does look the healthiest he's ever looked
Love my fellow Cinci boy Mox. Thank you for the inspiration. Proud of you brother. Welcome back time to get the strap back
Loved the promo. Wish Mox would’ve come out to his previous music though. I miss that theme.
Jon moxley 👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏
Welcome back Mox
This got me right in the feels....as a person that  fights the same deamon everyday and has been winning since December 14th 2017 I can honestly say I know how he feels. There was nothing but pure emotion in his words and you can see it in his eyes. Also such a great show of respect by the crowd. Great to see Moxley back!!
cant believe people still attend this.
I wonder what entry he’s going to be
I would be the guy screaming "mox botches deathmatches!" and he would have security kick me out hahaha
No one cares about your problem stick to wrestling
Sweatshirt
I hope he also improved his in ring work
What a fucking promo!
"These days, the only thing I drink IS BLOOD!!!!"  Epic stuff.  Welcome back, Mox!
People wearing masks while Moxley is talking about scars and being themselves... People are fucking stupid.
mox i though you were out of aew to go to the royal rumble : (
Punk vs mox
Se ve más delgado lo prefiero así y no inflado v: me gustaría que deje el pelo largo como en czw ese es moxley 😎🤙🏾
that’s dean ambrose.
Mox looks incredible bring on the violence
He looks so much healthier it’s awesome
lmao o shit i knew black cloud was 4real he wasnt playing with him good to see he back tho
🌪
I think Jon Moxley is my favorite wrestler, and this promo cements that
Glad mox acknowledged he had a problem and did something about it.he's looking great can't wait for him to whup some ass
For God so loved the world that He gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)✝️
Definitely looked alot slimmer. Good to see him back
Positive mox kicks the shit out a guy maybe a camera man when doing his Goofy snake walk out to the Ring
Ohio in da house!
It takes a VERY brave man to first, admit you have a problem, and second to do something about it. For him to be able to say that he is no longer an alcoholic, but is now a RECOVERING alcoholic makes Jonathan Good a much better man than Jon Moxley could ever HOPE to be as a wrestler. Good luck to you, sir.
What a Effin A-Class promo! Welcome back JeeeaaaAAAAANNNN MOOAAAAXXXLLEEEEYYY !!!!
"Real Talk". Good on ya Mox.
Thanks Mox, been insecure about the scar on the back of my neck from my neck surgery for a long time.
Our grandkids are gonna be talking about this one day. Glad to see him back
DAMN!!!!!!!!
I cried, what a battle he had, and what a survivor he's been.
AEW has a clean looking set up I like the all black ropes and turnbuckles.
His face has slimmed down so well. Got that babyface look again. He doesn't look as old/ragged. Regained a little bit of youth. Good for you Mox. I know. I understand. It's been 6 years of pure hell, but I haven't touched a drop. You can't promise you'll never do it again, because each day it's a constant battle and with people who have a lot of mental shit going on it makes it just that much harder. But we gotta keep moving forward brother. Respect.
dean Ambrose Version♥️💪🏽
What did the guy in the audience yell at Mox? It was hard to hear
I love dean Ambrose i love you jon moxley
Now THAT was a promo
What did that guy in the crowd say
Welcome Back Mox Man! Looking good buddy!
Welcome back Mox glad to see you back
AEW sure give it that old school feelings with all the signs 🔥🔥
Now this promo was REAL AF welcome back MOX
Nice to see Mox back and has overcome his battle god bles him when your in a dark place you got to stay strong and fight and beat our demons and I know it's not easy glad Mox is doing good and is back
WELCOME BACK JON MOXLEY!
He belongs to Shield
Thanks Justin Roberts
Deán Ambrose regreso el medio lunático ya  ponganle la música  qué bueno
DAMN he looks Great!!! Happy he’s clean and looking healthier than ever
Looking like his old self from 2019 💪🏾
Welcome back Mox!!!!
What a hero
Jon look skinny
Downvoted - PLEASE stop using that stupid intro music...it's FUCKING AWFUL
And this is why you don't give this man a microphone lol
Unless ur talking, u have to wear a mask. Hmmmmmm!!!!
Can anyone tell me what the jerk in the audience said?
does the good mox to see 😁 I have to say he looks really fitt
Scars from the cross is the worst I ever carried!!!!
Jon looks like he de-aged ten years. Lookin' real sharp.
Looking good Mox , welcome back,  you have been missed , plenty think they are the boss , you will show them who is boss now 👍
Looks very fresh
I have always loved Mox. He is due massive respect. His promos are among the best in the business. Go get 'em Jon!
"Get that f××××× piece of trash out of the ring."   Yeah, buddy, you're a real winner.
first thing he says is gfy to the obligatory clout chaser
Man I miss the heck out of Mox.
Sooooo what.....
We’ll there goes my hope of a shield reunion next weekend at the rumble🥺
Very inspiring
Moxley for the win
That theme sucks, he needs to go back to his original aew theme. His character is  to much, it's like a drunk dude at the bar. At this point this guy looks like he should be wrestling in hard hardcore indy promotions. All those stupid "hardcorp" 🙄  matches do not help either. Jon moxley sucks...dean ambrose was a way better character.
I liked Mox's old theme better.  Sometimes in house music is better than paid for tunes.
What the hell did that guy holler?
evergreen promo..not only for wrestling fans..but 2022's great comeback story for all who want to recover, heal, liberate..
I mean I'm glad he's back but...idk he kinda makes me cringe.  He's clover valley Steve Austin lol.  His rehab was a bit too advertised for me to actually care.  If he was a regular Joe working at McDonald's no one would care.    But since he's jon mox all the suddenly I should?  Idk.  Again, wish him the best, just wish he would...idk, be less cringe lol.
AEW just has to give him a belt and let him defend it for at least a year for two get him out his slump
His theme song couldn’t be more perfect.  Flashes of the loose cannon Brian Pillman
This ranks among the top AEW promos in its relatively short history(Cody Rhodes' promo before Full Gear 2019 is probably the most notable among them), but this hits different because it's coming straight from the heart. By talking so honestly about his demons-albeit in a unique way-Moxley has made it OK for people to open up about their own battles. It's good to see Jon back and looking better than he has.
So happy he’s back home, now he has to take back his title
2:34
We should all be so fortunate to get to bare your soul to the world and have them congratulate you for it! Well done and deserved Mox!!
Why does he come out to a female rendition of Wild Thing? lol. Would be way more badass if he came out to the Troggs version.
It's great that Moxley is open and honest about his demons and his battles. Now comes the hardest part in any recovering addicts journey: realizing the battle never ends and the demons never truly go away. But he definitely sounds and looks a lot better.
One of the cool things about AEW (they are a lot) IS that because thé wrestlers are very free, they Can give so Many positives messages.... Like when punk said  "If you're in a placé where you think you need help, do it Ask for it reach out. Text somebody call somebody... Nothing harder but nothing more courageous
Welcome home Moxley
Loved it but please change his music
Did that guy get kicked out
This is such an inspiring promo. I want to kick the shit out of my demons just as much as Moxley does
Wow.  That was a RIDE.  The sheer intensity and honesty.  Pacing the ring like a caged lion.  Promo of the year 2022?
why is it that everytime he talks i wanna fight him...? why? is it the fire he has? idk... good to see him back tho...
I couldn't watch this promo once. I had to suck all the words that Mox said last night on Dynamite. He has ALL my infinite respect. He has shown how dark his world is. It's even darker than anybody living on God's green earth. Until he saw a light at the other end. The light of hope and change to get him moving forward. I'm very, very proud of him. He's not only doing this for himself, he is doing it for his wife Renée and his beautiful daughter Nora. Welcome back Death Rider cuz you have a looooong road to go.
Holy nuts! That was a promo you'd follow a man into war with. From DEEP down.
Mox response to that fan absolutely brilliant response welcome back Mox
just a bummer seeing everyone wearing masks
Love jr well he didn't change much
At this point Jon Moxley needs a hair cut
I was at the event when he beat #10 in the tournament. A week later I heard he went to get help I was proud of him. I was excited to see what he will do when he gets back. Now I am more excited after this promo. He looks leaner and more fit and more violent. He is AEW
Did anyone hear what that guy said in the audience?
What did that one guy yell out?
Moxley was saying how he wanted his character after the Shield to be similar to John McClane from Die Hard. I can definitely see that. He's an absolute underdog everyman.
Love this guy since The Shield days and it's not good to see him happy and healthy
He kinda looks like his old 2012-2014 self, good to see him back
He better say something!!! The scars we carry!!! I was for it I'm glad he is back and better than ever!!
Damn he slimmed back down to Dean Ambrose's size😭
He looks great. So happy for him.
This is John moxley’s best promo by far. And it was amazing.
Dean Ambrose
Peru 🇵🇪❤️
For those wondering like me, the fan said "Get the garbage truck and get the trash out the ring! BOOOO!"
He looks and sounds completely different as a sober man, I bet he been clappin the hell outta Renee since he been back 😂
Jon looked like a true Crackhead
All he drinks is BLOOD THESE DAYS. I haven't seen 1 comment that references that he is saying he quit Alcohol addiction and his new addiction is Wrestling for what he's always sacrificed. 🤣  Everyone talking about keeping a crowd quiet on a promo. That's not new. The Undertaker gets that in 80% of his promos from respect. People are missing the main point of this 🤣. It's not about silent crowd or how bad ass Moxley looks lmao. It's about quiting a bad addiction for a healthy addiction. That is all this promo is about. Y'all need to start paying more attention. Because some of y'all typing SILENT AND LISTEN and y'all not doing either hahahaha.
"I've been to hell. I don't recommend it, but it's very liberating" 🙌
one of my greatest inspirations right there
To make AEW awesome  Do you need to bring Roman reigns and Seth Rollins
The Man is just that a Man a pure Warrior inside amd outside the ring.
If Jon Moxley can beat his demons, then anyone can. That's what his return tells us.
Was that an actual fan that yelled that? And honestly he's not wrong im not talking bout "Jon Moxley" the person, but "the wrestler"he is a shit in ring performer. Decent on the Mic but if he just tried to not always have the same match he would really be great.
🤩🤩🤩
Very glad he's back. Get his book, its a hell of a read.
Inspiration
Legend
Proud of you. Beating Demons isn't easy. I am definitely going buckle up for a wild ride. Good Luck in all you do and God Bless
Hey Mox what you said is half true. But I'm different than you in every way. Because when I fight that all I do kick anyone's ass and I don't care who I fight. Because I'm always the real Winner that doesn't care about what anyone says or thinks about me and that's why. Because I'm a real fighter in the MMA and that's why.
Mox It is my macho man yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
F*ck Arsenal!!
Dean Ambrose!
The live show is on a delay and TBS let the F bomb go. It was justified in this context.
Thank u moxley,for pouring out ur heart and soul.i respect u
Cosplay Steve Austin such a nerd
Way less puffy in the face
Love how silent the crowd were whislt he delivered such a first class promo! Mad respect JM 👊
Aew where free speech goes to die. Yes dude said idiotic stuff, but come on.
Hell yes Jon mox
Makes me glad I got sober. Even tho I don't think aew will be calling me anytime soon. Hope he has figured some things out can't stand a lot of any wrestling these days regardless of promotion but mox is great. And so was ambrose.
He seeking Jesus Christ 💯
Mox lookn great, he looks younger
Dude is cringe af
Seth Rollins/Roman: You know the fans will eventually turn on you.  Me: Yes, because you two are boring Vincent McMahon puppets.
Early candidate for Promo of the year. The honesty there was incredible. Great job on getting clean Mox and thank you for reminding us its ok to fall sometimes as long as we pull ourselves back up.
Great to see Jon back, greatings from fan from Poland 🇵🇱
BREAKING: Dean Ambrose makes AEW debut.
I'm 5 years sober and it has been worth every tear.  Welcome back Mox!!!
His face lost a lot of the puffiness he had.
The Soul of AEW, and maybe professional wrestling, is back looking better than ever!!!!!!!!  And first day back, first masterclass in how to do a promo 🔥🔥🔥
Welcome back u Lantic
Anybody else getting emotional listening to this? Proud of you Mox!
What did the fan say at 2:30 that pissed Jon off ??
Who else thinks Hangman vs Mox for the championship would be a good match? Hangman might not be able to put him through more hell then Mox has already been through but I think it would be a great match.
Moxley please go back to your unscripted violence theme.. this look, this persona completely matches with that theme
amazing promo, MOX is an incredible talent, he has been missed, welcome back Jon!!!
He needs a better entrance theme
As a recovering addict/alcoholic I can 100% relate with Moxley. I’m glad he came on TV and gave that promo/shoot promo on his life. It takes a brave soul to admit that they are powerless over drugs and alcohol, that their life has become unmanageable. It takes a true man/woman to admit that. But I didn’t get to watch this live because I keep forgetting to turn my TiVo to TBS so my question is what did the guy say in the crowd when it went silence that made marchly say what he said to the guy. And I hope the guy got kicked out if he said what I thought he said. Can someone shed some light on that for me, please
Hope he comes out with new music next time to fit this new energy
Dean ambrose is his real name
As a mental health professional I really appreciate, how Moxley emphasized on his mental health  issues. We need more people like Moxley to talk about those scars to create awareness.
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Great to see Moxley back‼️  Meanwhile Justin Roberts : Jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn Moooooooooooxxxxxxxxllllllllleeeeeeeyyyyyyyy!!!
*CM Punk vs. Jon Moxley*
Great to see MOX back! 👍Be proud of your scars. You learn from them. No doubt MOX here! He will be champion again!
Thank you for the massage you just say am also in RECOVERY <3 thank youuu . for fighting and im fighting with you .... I'am Six months CLEAN and more too come <3 im also in a REHAB Treatment . and i feel i have it like him . .
This beats out almost every Jeff Hardy comeback because Moxley actually looks and sounds better than when he went out. And rather than living in this fantasy land where nobody struggles and real problems are buried under the most tacky of storylines, AEW is letting people air their real struggles and use them as a beacon to encourage people going through their own to seek help. What a time to be a wrestling fan.
The promo battle between punk & Moxley, when they eventually have a promo against each other, is going 2 be INTENSED!
He Lost A Lot Of Weight Looks Great!
Justin nailed it every time
I think MOX was watching episode 4 of the book of boba fett before he came out   to do this speech. On a side note can we have a cm punk mix feud moving forward?
MOX4LYFE
DC is full of cucks
Good on him getting clean
Welcome back! Beware of the demons !
It's great to see him back. Kinda ironic that it happened just a few days after his former brothers in arms started their feud on the other company. I kinda wanna see them back together but outside of wrestling. Have Joe Anoa'i, Jon Good and Colby Lopez in a Fast & Furious kinda movie would be awesome.
what did the guy say
WHAT. A. FUCKING. PROMO. HOLY. SHIT.
Seeing him back (and looking good) brought a tear to my eye. Welcome back Mox!
He looks so much better, glad he worked his way through it and made his way to the other side
Moxley is back and he looks amazing and he looks ready for a fight that's why I always look up to him
I really hope they actually kicked that douche bag out.
Jon moxley has crazy stone cold vibes in his promo
Jon Moxley is going to terrorize aew, mark my words 🔥❤️
that wasn’t a promo. that was pure honestly. haven’t heard something that raw in wrestling for a while now. really happy for jon man
Moxley 💖☠☠
Welcome back Jon!
"I don't run from demons, I beat the shit out of them" CHILLS
Jon moxley is back
Jon Moxley should be the first two-time AEW World Champion.
I'm Thirsty !!
We love you Moxley  nice yo see you back
Been some time he became a vampire
🔥🔥🔥
So when are we getting a 2nd world title run for Mox
Crazy that this massive transformation only took a few months. Kudos Jon :)
Welcome back Mox
That’s what I called a F… great promo. I been following Moxley for a long time. Am glad he better now. I agree sometimes we have to go to hell and come back. I did exactly that during my 17 years army active duty and many combat tours.
Looking at pictures before and after this rehab is increidble. Im so happy for him and he looks amazing. I didnt even realize it was this bad
Every word has a deeper meaning. Each words were power. Moxley's energy always gets me fired up
As a fan of your work Jon Moxley.  Its wonderful to see you doing so well, Sir.
It's refreshing to listen to a wrestler cut a promo without hearing "WHAT?!" after every sentence.
Good to see the baddest man on the planet back ❤️❤️❤️
Happy for Jon and it's great to see him back. It's also refreshing to see a man in the ring, unscripted telling his story which will resonate with millions.
I wonder, did they ever kick that dude out?. 🤔 🤣
Welcome back Moxley!!💪💪
Mox looks great! Hope he continues down the road he is on and the real fans will be here for all of it!
Welcome back Jon
Your entrance was good. Punk’s was better. The difference? Ice cream bars!
Not the welcome back speech I was expecting....😐
Powerful words 👏👏
Don't know why anyone likes Motley. Boring. Zero personality. His matches suck.
That cloud became a clown. Congrats Mox seriously
Why did he kicked a guy out of show?
You'd all be screaming and raging if Reigns threw out a fan over some little words that upset him.
Ohhh yeah, this is what we need!!!
this one of the best promos ever in wrestling… ya i said it…ever… the acknowledgement of demons and the acknowledgement of addiction and struggles in this day and age now more than ever has incredible impact.. empowerment to anyone going thrugh the same thing..amazing work
DA🔥🔥🔥
No.24 royal rumble ❤️❤️❤️
Stay away from alcohol people, you don't have to drink just because most people do, or to look "cool".. we all go through stuff.. drinking won't make you forget your problems, it will add to it.. It is possible to live without alcohol.. straight edge..
I’m right there with you Mox 💯 welcome back I’ve missed ya
Such a great promo, he really spoke to all those who have been struggling with their demons in life. Glad to see him being back in a good shape.
I teared up watching this, things are hard right now and this is the reminder i needed
he finally loss weight
It's Dean ambrose
If you thought this was a promo it wasnt... That was man on the brink of a breakdown Bearing his soul to the world in a place he feels secure and safe... The wrestling ring and around the fans. It's his safety blanket. To speak his mind and let out his emotions He confronted an evil that I wish on no one. This man has everything, a beautiful wife, a beautiful daughter and a great career but sometimes those particular demons he's talking about make those big things look small. Alcohol is no joke. It's evil in the purest form. And it has a serious appetite. It's eats everything in your life that you care about. But this man did what was best for him and his family and conquered his demons that most people crumble and can't. Mox.... Welcome Back And Sir I salute you. Stay strong brotha.
Moxy came in there like Ricky Vaughn
This is a great promo and I mean GREAT. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MOX
Jon Moxley is a hero he is a overcomer now it's time for that fire to shine bright let's go Moxley
Welcome back! Brilliant work!
Hope that heckler is banned for life for shouting that! Prick
What's this guys gimmick, he gets drunk and mumbles?!
Hmmm. What have I been missing since 2022 started....a Moxley promo off course. Glad he's back and looks even younger and healthier than before he left.
Congratulations to Mox, kicked alcohol's ass. One of the best in the business, no doubting that. Great promo (if you can even call it that), great to see him back (have to say...the guy looks in the best shape of his life) and great that the hole he left in AEW has been filled.
what happened to Dean Ambrose?
What Mox said in this promo was 100% true to a T. Nobody's perfect and we go through demons no matter how big they are. The way he describes going through his demons was fuckin GENIUS. Couldn't put it any better myself. Glad to see Mox back and I'm sure we'll see him back in action soon.
Poor Moxley😒
The Mox!
He looks slimmer
Wow Aew is great to finally bring back John moxley 👍👍
I'm happy The Mox is back.
I love that silence from the crowd. When Mox speaks - we dare to listen.
Jim Ross, "Well he aint changed much" still has it.... the Old Dog delivered with that comment.
powerful promo
Okay I'm not crying yall are crying! Welcome back Mox!!!!
"Go f*ck yourself." Starting his TBS run with a BANG!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Any idea what the guy in the crowd said that pissed Jon off?
Damn if that didn't bring tears to my eyes..
Mox looking sexier 😍😘 happy for him!

Dude looks 5 years younger!
Damn, looking good!

@ 0:46 Moxley was like : *HOLD MY BEER 🍺*

I really hope they escorted that person out. The people around him must've ducked away from him as quickly as possilbe
Let's Fucking GOOOOOO i'm so happy for him to get health and get good

I’m so glad aew kept the fan outburst in it adds a lot to jons promo and makes it even more real
he is gotta to be at the Royal rumble I am very excited
2:30 Fan :Get this druken piece of trash out of the ring
It would have been THE PERFECT moment for one CM Punk to turn Heel.
powerful
What that guy say that was yelling?
MY FAVORITE!!!!!!!
Mox is the man! He's back stronger than ever and all of AEW better watch out! Welcome back Mox!
jon moxley confirmed for wwe's forbidden door at royal rumble

Wecome back, Jon
I love you Dean Ambrose
That 7 minute promo just flew by as I was captivated by ever single word JON MOXLEY said!!! He could have gone another 7 minutes easily!!!
he's my god
Mox sees your toxic masculinity and gives it a paradigm shift
I don't run from demons, I beat the shit out of them....... 👌👌👌
2:30-2:33 Mox sounded like Austin when his return in 2003  “ 6 months ago I told my boss Vince McMahon to shove it” 😳💯
_“Someone get this drunken piece of trash outta the ring! Booo!”_ –infamous last words
That Arsenal fan though 😅
good to see him well and healthy again i missed him so much
Wooow Jon comeback 🔥❤👻 Dean came back to royal rumble please 🥲 reunion with two of your brothers
Overrated Moxley is back
Moxley looking younger.
What did that one fan say in the beginning??????
35K likes with 0 Dislikes.. Moxley is the truth!!!!! 🐐
One of the baddest mf in the business today and is Fina grab the life by the horns and put us on paradigm shift
What was that fan even saying?
That's good hes doing ok and strong spirit. Always talk to a friend your not alone
Loved this promo and honestly I was shocked when he said the f word on live tv,btw Cody's promo was also really good
Moxley promo vs. Roman Reigns /Seth Rollins promo
Im glad he’s back one of my favs
Bravo Jon! Your "promo" not only brought you back into wrestling with a BANG! But it also gave people hope, IT SHOWED PEOPLE THEY AREN'T ALONE!! IT SHOWED PEOPLE WITH ANY ISSUES, ADDICTION, MENTAL HEALTH, DEPRESSION, OR ANYTHING THAT AFFECTS THEIR LIVES, YOU SHOWED THEM THEY CAN SPEAK UP!! THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE HEARD AND TO BE HELPED!! JON MOXLEY, I WISH TO GOD I WOULD HAVE HEARD THESE WORDS AND MORE SO I WISH I WOUKD HAVE BELIEVED IT! NEVER EVER EVER! NEVER BE ASHAMED OF YOU! NEVER! NEVER BE ASHAMED OF A ILLNESS, A DISEASE, AN ADDICTION WHICH IS A DISEASE AS WELL! WE ARE ALL SPECIAL, WE ALL DESERVE HELP, LOVE, AND SUPPORT.  THANK YOU MOX! YOUR SPEECH HAS GIVEN OTHERS A CHANCE, GAVE THEM GUTS, AND GAVE THEM HOPEFULLY A WILLINGNESS TO COME FORWARD WITH THEIR ISSUES AND SEEK HELP! JON, I HAVE RESPECTED YOU MORE THAN ALL OTHER WRESTLERS, AND NOW I RESPECT YOU BEYOND THAT! AGAIN THANK YOU SIR! KEEP FIGHTING, AND STAY STRONG! GOD BLESS YOU AND BE SAFE!
He better turn full heel
He's back and he's looking for blood
kinda weak to ask for the heckler to be thrown out, you stand in front of adversity, not in front of yes men, thats how you become free
Welcome back Jon moxley looking so strong 💪love  from Pakistan 🇵🇰
He feels greater than roman and brock when he pulls off things like this 🤩🤩
Moxley has an audience member thrown out because they hurt his feelings. *If that's all it takes then Moxley will be back on the sauce soon enough.*
So he's a vampire...
Most overrated wrestler Jon moxley.
If you want to play as Jon Moxely in Wrestling revolution 3d then see the tuotrial that I have uploaded bro
Always remember him as dean ambrose

The fact the crowd shut up and listened to Mox as he bares his soul to them. Gotta love that

Sammy Guevara vs Jon Moxley. It would be the most unexpected challenge
WELCOME BACK !AEW ROCKS
Good to see Jon Moxley back!
Damn proud of Jon! It takes a big man to see the demon and choose to beat it and then talk about it to everyone on live TV. I know I had to face the very same demon an it sure as hell is NOT easy…. You couldn’t have Spoken truer words! Congratulations Jon remember one day at a time bro. Be proud & welcome home!
Dude got 20 years younger in three months. You love to see it
so happy jon moxley return!
Why u change title??????
Dean Ambrose
Boooooooring
Holy shit Mox looks 10 years younger!
John Moxly looks great, last time i seen him he looked abit chubby in the face and very old, he looks amazing now, also did he get a hair transplant? Last time I seen him he was losing his hair
What exactly did the heckler yell? I only made out a few lines that sounded like "get that piece of trash out of the ring." Anyone know?
Mox for President 2024!
Jon Moxley looks like he used Time Machine
Shut up Schiavone so we can hear Mox speak S: Yes Sir Mr. Ross Sir
He looks like the time he debuted with the shield.
Now he can go back down to the midcard @me scrubs 🖕😏🖕
The. Lunatic. French. 🤙🤙🤙
This isn't GCW and this isn't from January 22nd.
When this man speaks, people listen! :)
What this guy has done in the last few months is inspirational.
I appreciate Dr Itepu on YouTube for helping me eradicate herpes simplex virus 1&2 with herbal Roots  supplement permanently within two weeks I got my life back.
What was the guy saying that got kicked out?
My favourite
A huge pop was there!
Play as Jon Moxely now in Wrestling revolution 3d. I have created a tutorial of making Jon Moxely in Wrestling revolution 3d. Check it & make it in your game. Now it is time to bring the unscripted violence to your phone as the death rider is coming.
What did that fan say that made mox call him a piece of shit lol
Not trying to give the guy any like attention but does anyone know what he said that made mox kick his ass out??
My all time avourite jon moxley
Well, I'm buying his T shirt
My favorite shield, But hes my shield when it comes wrestling entertainment.  List Chirs Jericho Randy Orton Cesararo Jon Moxley
Glad he’s doing ok, and I hope it last for him and his family. It’s tough out there ain’t it? Even for those with more than most. For those reading, if you need help, be like Mox baby!
This is much better then CM Punk’s return promo.
Only jon moxli ❤️❤️❤️
He looks… normal
I missed him so much 😍😍😍
GOAT
Jack the Snake level promo  I felt every word it put me in his shoes brought me to tears
Hes a fuckin Motivational speaker
It is great to see him back, he looks healthy
Mox looks incredible  So happy to see him again
Mox looks incredible  So happy to see him again
To paraphrase a line from another famous John, this is the kind of speech firework displays listen to when they need to release on the motivational posters where they work. Mox is an inspiration, and anyone who doubts him...well, they can follow the same advice Mox gave that "fan" at the start.
Back to happy day because John is back
Moxley said he drank blood. Sounds to me like a vampire joke .
I wish he would have said that to the Brock Lesnar guy
WHAT A PROMO. Absolutely love this; it's straight from the heart. Massive respect to Jon and hope he finds all the happiness and success from here on out 🤘
Jon Moxley is the John Cena of AEW.
Wow he looks leaner and more handsome
So fucking proud of this man. I'm proud to be a fan.
I was so worried about him. Thank God that he came back. I love this Man so much ❤️
he looks healthy glad hes growing his hair back
Heart ❤ of aew
Jon Moxley is back on AEW TV better than ever
Drunk
when its real it feels
Not only did he cut a promo he cut a promo for anybody who's ever suffered ,silencing a rowdy crowd ,there's now 2 promos that make me cry Eddie Guerrero Vs Brock promo and this ,fair play mox u where missed
These days, All I drink is blood!
Moxley should beat the shit out of the demon Malakai Black
i see dean embrose  with dat walk
What happened to him?
Waa I be married to Renee young I make millions the new outsiders cm.punk and mox. Taking down companies like hall and nash
When life gets hard, Mox reminds me that we can get thru anything. Don't give up on your self, Believe in your dreams and in yourself. Thank you Mox .
"Jeeeeeyooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn Moxxxxxxxxxxlllleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey"
I am so glad Moxley gets to be himself. This company just keeps raising the bar.
CM punks needs veterans like Moxley to work with. Cm punk working with MJF and his goons doesn’t feel right yet. MJF is still finding himself with regular promos that any fan would say.
Jesus that is the mox that man looks so much better tbh I’m glad he didn’t run from his demons and he fights them head on!
2:30 what does he says?
He prob wrote this promo in rehab No joke, being in rehab sucks at first then you find yourself again. It’s a beautiful thing
Uk..
What did the guy say in the crowd?
Haven’t heard people go this crazy while “Wild Thing” played since Rick Vaughn. Welcome back, Moxley.
Jon Moxley is awesome!  I’m glad he’s doing better.  He’s my favorite wrestler.  His promo is inspiring and his message resonates with me.  Scars are meant to be shown. You bear it all.
Now I began watching again
Nothing better than being freshly sober
Ddaaaayyyuuum okay bars 🔥
Mox🤩🤩😍😍😍😍
Man, just clip out that guy who ruined the return of mox
The king moxley Ambrose
It has been a minute Joh Moxley... My favourite in AEW afterCM Punk
Addiction sucks, but Mox, you best have some humility, because your demons don't rest or go away.
Man in Black; Johnny Cash back!
Talk about a declaration of war from one of the best
That promo gave me more hope than I've ever had. Alcohol ain't no joke. Love you Mox.
Watching what they are doing Seth makes me so happy with what Mox is doing. More power to him.
he does look way healthier for me but i dunno
Selfmade LEGEND
2:35 - Anyone say what. That guy said?
I'm disappointed that we never got lunatic Jon Moxley on national television. The promos and the way he carried himself in the early to 2000's to 2010 were amazing.
I wonder what would happen if The Miz and MJF had a chance to do a promo together
LoL thats funny enforce masks in aew 😅
He needs jesus
Kicking ass and drinking blood.Welcome back Mox.
Man that was crazy the MoX is back but I wish he would one day out of nowhere that him Roman Reigns Seth would wear the face coverings and well you know but if you don’t know the.   SHIELD hahaha
I’ve been down, but this brought me up
Great speech
Moxley. Looks in great shape
When Mox talks he reminds me so much of the Cactus Jack Promos so much feeling and so believable
We All love Jon Moxley 😎
One of the best promos that Mox has ever cut....it comes straight from the heart.
Moxley sucks. I agree with the fan. Get that drunk out of the ring. He chose to be an alcoholic.  Nobody forced the booze into him. Now we are supposed to celebrate him like he is a hero because he stopped doing it? Screw that. Maybe if he is that weak he shouldn't have started drinking at all. Overrated piece of trash.
W E L C O M E B A C K 🤍
My favorite Jon Moxley promo ever. A true inspiration. “I don’t run from demons, I just beat the shit out of them.” Amazing
What did he say? I fell asleep
Dropping an F bomb on live TV 6 seconds into his return is the most Jon Moxley thing he could have done. Perfect.
Mox: give me a fresh cut Barber: no prob fam. I'll hook you up with the eddie munster 😉
This wasn't a promo. Mox was preaching, and I loved it.
Great return, mid promo.
people still wearing all those masks! 😂
Attitude guy 😍
Can’t stand that ring announcer
Welcome back Joooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnn Moxxxxxxxlllllleeeeeyyyyy!!!!!
Moxley looks great Welcome back Mox
John Moxley U prooved that by SHEER HARD WORK u  can achieve anything
congrats, Jon.. and that was amazing 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Man this isn't about Wreslin only  This is motivational ,Some inspiring line from Johny boy
✝️🙏🏻❤️💪🏻👊
Welcome back Jon Moxley. You are my inspiration and hero. What you said made me cry but have more strength with my mental health issues. You have helped me open up about it. "I don't run from demons I just beat the shit out them".
Anyone saying he beat his demons obviously doesn’t really understand addiction. This isn’t meant as a insult but a lot of people seem to take it that way. Addiction is a lifelong battle but specifically the first two years of sobriety is not easy at all so he is very much still in the battle. You don’t beat addiction in two months. I wish him the best of luck & hope he gets this.
Welcome back Moxman! He looks better than ever! And that promo is already promo of the year.
Wyndham would be the best person to test Moxley on his demons.
Don moxley
2:30 What did the fan said?
Not gonna lie this looks like dean ambrose not jon moxley.
Mox can’t handle the heckler? Bro ain’t fit for this business. Yes I’m not a Moxley fan when it comes to the wrestling business.
He looks 10 years younger
Amazing, heart-warming stuff here, great to see Jon back and feeling better. Goosebumps went down my spine when the crowd sung along to his theme.  Shame some disrespectful chode in the crowd decided to heckle him, but hey, he got shut down like he deserved
Aew is so good... What better can they do?
Jon The Snake Roberts Moxley
HUGE
Welcome back again moxley
Thank You Moxley. BullyBilly.
As a mental health professional I really appreciate, how Moxley emphasized on his mental health  issues. We need more people like Moxley to talk about those scars to create awareness.
Swole Moxley
I've been in a similar situation that Moxley went through and it is HARD AS HELL to admit to and then try to fix your problems. I applaud him for doing this to help himself and his family. I also give AEW MAJOR RESPECT for not only giving him the chance to help himself but also publicly supporting him, giving him the help and support he needed. Recovery is a long hard road, but when you have a support center like Renee Young, Tony Khan, and the rest of a team like AEW has, 👍 Moxley, the sky is just the beginning! I don't like following the norm, with all the compliments of you look great, but DAMN YOU DO! Your acceptance and determination to work on you has worked in all aspects of your life. There is a reason your my top Wrestler and have been for years! You never give up, you know what you want, and even if it's a hard road you do it, and do it right! Now GET THE AEW WORLD TITLE!! 🌎 GLAD TO SEE YOU BACK MOX! TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!
The way Justin Roberts says "Jon" no longer annoys me lol that other network drove me crazy with that, I wonder why? "He asked with much awareness"
Mox is looking like himself back in 2018-2019 . Much younger and healthier .
Am I the only one who finds it ridiculous that Mox is allowed to walk through a forced masked crowd mask-less? I guess Covid knows the difference between a performer and audience member. Lol
Lunatic Fringe
A good talker can make the crowd pop , but a great one can make them shut up and listen .
Seith rollins and Roman reigns made u
The MoX is back!!!!!!
AWESOME THE MOXLEY IS BACK WHERE HE BELONGS NOW GO KICK SOME ASS MOX!!!!!!!!!!
These demons can stick around, I just hope he isn't creating an imposter to hide his true self from an environment he can't escape, it's ourselves we need to come face to face with. I hope he stays strong.
Roofs gunna blow off when he enters the forbidden door to the Rumble ;)
GOAT always loved Mox 💪🏻
He looks like if he lost 10 lbs
"These days all I drink is blood" 🔥
what did the fan say 😂
It gave me chills that the crowd was silent during his promo. It was similar to someone giving a testimony at church except was more swearing lol.
Royal rumble 🤘🏻
I have missed those Justin Roberts patented throat-burners, and by gawd almighty, that is already a candidate for promo of the year.
😌👑King Mox
My guy looking healthy!!!!
No me gusta estos luchadores se la pasan solo hablando
🤔...Well said.
Buckle up fellas.
Best promo ever from Mox.  One of the best AEW promos too in my opinion
4:00 Glad to have you back Mox. You're speaking to the hearts of a lot of people.
Mox: I don't run away from demons I beat them    Balor: 👀
Happy to see you back Jon back where you definitely belong. He looks better than ever.
This is going to be one of the greatest promos in this year, beautiful.
The legend is back
Let’s go he’s back 🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐
I'm gonna take a break from AEW..I'm sorry but I can't stand this guy..I enjoyed there product while he was out.. I'm 110 percent glad he's recovered..I'm proud 👏 absolutely I will start watching again when he's off tv..I don't like the way he treats his fans..
Welcome back Mox
#1 Jon Moxley fan and yeah i have two tattoos on my arm one saying DA and the other saying mox. He is my inspiration and I cried watching this what a legend. If anyone is reading this just know that you're loved and you matter.
I’m so happy that Mox is back! He looks really good!
What a shit promo
I would love to have him for asst. I would send him in to fire people with that walk!!!!!!👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾🍺🍺🍺
Welcome back moxley

Fake tough guy kid
Welcome back, Jon Moxley!
One of the very best promos of all time! Welcome back 💯% Moxley
❤️❤️❤️ what a man!
Moxley sucks always hated his gimmick
Loving he still uses onitas entrance music as well.
Wait he looks like dean Ambrose
Welcome home Mox, looking incredible dude!
Moxley looks happy and healthy welcome back
The king has returned
Mox you dont have to say thank you to us...we should thank you what you gave and still giving to this sport....my demons are running from me because i fight them like you mox.....thank you
Perfect promo
He should've stayed home
3 months to get cleared from that fucking booze that's impressive!!!! Now im just a bigger fan of moxley
What did the guy say to him at 2:28?
Yeeesssss. Finally. We love and missed you Jon moxley. Keep fighting
Seriously, if you’re not a fan of Jonathan Good (Jon Moxley) after that promo, are you really a wrestling fan at all? I’m not a rabid AEW fan, I watch when I can, but damn… Maybe I should be.
He looks so thin! Getting sober is the best way to shed weight.
I’m so happy I got to witness this in person. I was next to that aisle
Can't wait to see Ambrose at Royal Rumble 🔥
2:30  What did that fan say????
So happy to see him return in AEW👌👌.
Heel turn hogya kya bhau
I love aew
I really love that crowd perspective shot during this promo and Cody’s they kept using
yeah dude throws his shit at fans, pushes people, what a great guy. to hell with him
Mox vs punk 🤯🔥
good stuff hes back but he really needs to stop to walk like that. looks so stupid everytime :D
This theme does not fit him at all.
Moxley vs. Fiend confirmed (please please please!!) haha
Moxley vs punk, moxley vs Danielson, moxley vs Adam cole, moxley vs Adam page. So many possibilities.
This is what inspires me it’s emotional heck it fuels your body ignite you to be something better. Thank you Moxely Welcome back ✊👍🏻
Preach brother Moxley!
Dean aka Jon moxley my man is back love you moxley 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Welcome back welcome back Epic promo
Looking younger and healthier
Back John moxley
What did the guy in the crowd say? I couldn't make it out.
Happy to see he's doing okay, not the best promo, but he's back and that's what matters.
Getting major Austin vibes from him. His time is here. Take it Mox!
Love 😘
FUCKING MOX!!! WB!! This is the best news this year, eventho I got corona I cant help smile.... Fucking great to see you back Mox... BIG <3 from Denmark
I don't know if I've ever heard an arena that quiet. The respect the fans have for this guy is incredible.
3rd show on TBS, 1st time back since October, drops F bomb on live national TV.  Moxley gives zero fucks, love him
Can we get another Moxley title run!?!?
Eh
Mox looking like a 1940's irish mobster, welcome back
Day 2 of sobriety for me today. His promo was very much appreciated. So good to see him back.
Mox seems like he is in the best shape
I'm so happy Jon Moxley is finally back. He looks better now and he still looks cute 🥰 welcome home ❤️Jon Moxley ❤️
He looks like he's lost weight physically and emotionally. An awesome individual for what he has accomplished.
What did that heckler yell out?
Good thing the crowd was kinda quiet cause I barely understood what he was saying lol
Yes moxley back fit and healthy glad he's beaten his demons we always support you moxley
Seriously.? I grow up watching wrestling in the 80s which back then wrestling was full of alcohol wrestlers with much bigger (issues) inner demons and i didn't know and never learned about it..Suddenly every alcohol or drug addict after a rehab or whatever will be a hero.? You want to tell me that this guy for instance will give life lessons to my kids about inner demons and such..Don't get me wrong, i don't have anything against this guy, but i would prefer something more humble and real.
The Mox is back and looks to be badder than ever
Yes this is a promo, specially towards the end but the beginning was heartfelt and as real as he can get. 🔥
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Brought a tear to my eye!
Boring
Don't bleep the F word. Let Mox be Mox.
So sick of the masks. It's ridiculous
having just recently watched Major League, Wild Thing is a hilarious choice of music for Mox. Welcome back! Welcome Back! Welcome Back!
What was the heckler saying?
Was he drunk during this? I’m sure TBS is thrilled with him. Maybe Cornette is right after all about this buffoon.
Jon Fuckin Moxley!
Mox V Punk. Book it. Last Man Standing. In a Cage. With Lumberjacks. Inferno as well. BOOK IT.
It's the first ever to see the silent crowd like that during a promo + what a promo ! what a message ! Good to see Moxley healthy, fired up like that !
Glad he is back
I am happy to see mox
This promo gave me chills and inspiration. I am just speechless. Welcome back, Moxley! I hope to see you in Bridgeport!
Needs to ask MJF for advice on how to cut a promo
That fan was disrespectful
god I missed him 🤍 he’s incredible and this promo (which I really didn’t expect from him) was exactly what was needed to be said.
Welcome Back Moxley!
The way he dealt with the heckler was amateur as hell
"Cause what don't kill ya make you more strong."
Good to see Jon Moxley(Dean Ambrose) back in AEW.
Moxley new tattoo
His promo and the crowd's response are like how the stars do promo in Japan (except the douche) .
Ive never seen a venue so quite the whole place listened to every word that great bloke said so great to see ive been there and no what hes on about so do many others and sooooo great to see him back healthy god bless u moxley
w8 wut was the fan saying that Mox asked to kick out?
Dean Ambrose
Welcome back

Man, Justin Roberts is just terrible.
What did that guy yell? Anybody hear it?
Moxley moxley moxley
Waitaminute that's not Rick Vaughn
Mox lost some weight damn
Mox looks super healthy right now and definitely in a good head space. We have missed you Mox!!!!!!!!
Are we gonna overlook the fact that the crowd was DEAD silent. That is the ultimate measure of respect.
Rehab made him look gaunt
When he talk everyone listen quietly
Justin Roberts.   Can we get another announcer?  Geez
I like his response to that disrespectful fan. It was perfect
But congratulations on your rehab
I'm having a nightmare too your back
now this is awesome
Holy crap talk about inspirational. The conviction in his voice. The edge that only true conflict and harsh times can give. Welcome back sir and I can’t wait to see what’s next
Great to see you back!!!!!
Ladies and gentlemen, JJJJIIIIIIIAAAAAN MAAAAXLEEEEEYYYY!!!
I was fighting anxiety for half of a year I didn’t know till realise now I got back to my self and I am getting my self better this video made me feel normal again
U can see how close to home this was
As a recovering alcoholic myself, I sympathize with him. Good luck Mox and congratulations.
I missed him
He is looking like his old character " dean Ambrose" with this jacket
Anyone know what that fan was yelling at 2:31?
Welcome back!
Mox got me ready to run thru a fuggin brick wall right now
Did he really have that guy at the beginning thrown out of the arena?
Happy to see DEAN AMBROSE
Gonna see him in the rumble in a couple weeks too
MMMUUOOOOXLEY!! 😱
He channeled in his inner stone cold Steve Austin …… love it
Honestly didn't even notice.
welcome my favourite Wrestler
this industry was so dry without him
I miss unstable violence theme I wish he use that again
Welcome back MOX!
Welcome back MOX
Legend killer and Legend crazy moxley ambrose to favorite wrestling ❤
I love mox❤
Well come back to dean Ambrose
Moxley: "These days all I drink is blood!!!"  Danielson: " So, you watched my match against Hangman?"   Pls Tony give us Moxley vs Danielson 🙏🏻
Him booing Jon Moxley after everything I hope he really got kicked out sometimes people don’t need free speech especially when they abuse it the way they do
Great promo
The one and only Aew legend jon dangerous moxley🙌 then number 2 cm punk
Lol Mox got his feelings hurt and had a fan tossed out. Supposedly a violent and angry man. Hurt by someone calling him trash.
Does anyone know what the guy in the crowd yelled out, that made Jon tell him to go F himself? I couldn't make out what he said
This made me cry cause I have demons too
Moxley reminds me of stone cold especially how he had to fight his demons to get back to the ring and through injuries etc nice bloke
Had to get clean if he wanted to stay married and to see his new baby. If he didn't sure his marriage would been over.
Imagine Mox vs. Punk
Not Jon moxley this is a Dean Ambrose
What a promo. Inspirational stuff. Great to see Mox back
Moxley🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
“I don’t run from demons, i just beat their ass!” I needed that Jon. I love you dude. Glad to see you back!
I am wathching aew only for jon moxley😎😎
Welcome back Mox. Much respect and well wishes here. Can't wait to follow your success in the years to come.
He just cut a promo about mental health, essentially, and it just hit everyone in the feels!
How would Moxley be as The Joker?  I'm very intrigued.   I think he could be the perfect successor to Ledger.
So glad after that one idiot at the start it was like a Library when he started talking, welcome back Mox and thank you for having the courage to share your story with us all
Well said, Mox...I'm glad you're back and you're sober. That took guts, and I'm proud of you for overcoming your demons and whupping their asses....I'm looking forward to you getting back what was stolen from you, and that's the AEW World Championship
Absolutely powerful words here. I feel motivated and inspired! Welcome back Jon! Cant wait to see you back in action!
Champ is back
Glad he made it back.
He looks better with fuller hair on the sides than when he had it shaved with bits on top looking like Cletus from The Simpsons.
What happened? Great to see he is back! Great wrestler John Moxley
Is he most popular
Moxley moxley moxley
watt a lot off bullshit
Does every babyface in this company have to do a mental health promo? I have now heard Moxley, Kingston, and Danielson cut these promos and it’s fucking nauseating.
What a shoot this was. Straightforward and truthful, nothing but honesty. Glad he is back and healthy.
These days All I DRINK IS BLOOD! !! Great way to end such a fabulous promo
Such a bunch of BS if you didn't feel happy in your life why would you not at his place in life you have the job you wanted to have now at a company that wants to take care of you that wants you to be happy you have a wife a child now you know you probably make more money than anybody else in the whole entire industry not everybody but a bunch you're at the top what do you have to be upset by you're not focusing on your good stuff you just focusing on the little bitty small things that you think are bad ridiculous grow up
Leave it to Mox to sum up life per-fect-ly.
I just love how everyone was dead silent listening to his every word. So much respect.
Super flop wrestler 🤣🤣🤣
Great to see him back, but omg change his music back.
Have you ever heard such quiet crowd when someone's speaking?
Great promo!!! Very inspiring!!!
Welcome back Moxley!
The best promos are always ones that feel or truly are personally from the individual behind the wrestler
The Mox unhinged and crazy I love it welcome back
The boogeyman is back after beating his own demons hopefully he needs to get back to the top of the ladder either in New Japan or AEW
That sucked
Moxey is the greatest, he's like a new revamped stone cold Steve austin.
I am glad to see Jon Moxley back in the ring! I am glad he's better, he looks better & he hasn't changed a bit. Welcome back Mox! We've missed ya!
Good seeing Ambrose back
The themes are so generic .
Welcome back, Mox!!!
What did that one guy say. That made mox say get him out
i was hanging on every word this man was saying, so glad Mox is back and ready to kick some ass
Welcome back Jon. Thank u for getting the help you needed, beating the crap out of your demons for yourself and your family and being back for your fans as well.
Moxley 316
What is the reason for changing his theme song?
He has more hair now.
I’d like to think that the title of the video is a call out to every fan believing the rumors and leaks of a possible Moxley’s appearance to the Royal Rumble.    If it is, great job AEW.
His current form is much more beautiful. I wish you well always Jon Moxley
I'm waiting aew only one reason Jon moxley brother .,❣️❣️
MOXLEY IS BACK!! I’m so damn happy to see him doing better. He’s back home at AEW! 🔥🔥🔥
I dunno. I wish i did not watch this fucking lame ass video now. Give me another stone cold. I dont want to hear about a fictional characters. ultimately. relationship problems. The 3 months spent at a posh luxury rehab is not inspirational to me. Its not possible for most ppl. Good for him deciding to save his family tho.
I feel like that last shit was an accident.
Jon moxley brother ❣️❣️
My brother ... Dean Ambrose 😘
Get the garbage truck and get this piece of trash out of the ring 😂 then gets thrown out for it.. glad to see moxley beating his demons tho
Mox vs Black Mox vs Adam Cole MAKE IT HAPPEN TONY!
And that's how you do that!!
I don’t know about the rest of you, but I detected just a tad of Stone Cold Steve Austin’s mannerisms.
His speech was magnificent
What did dude in the audience shout at Mox during the beginning?!?!
Listening to this has helped me reliased that I should be proud of myself despite my scars, my mental health, my demons etc  Thanks Jon for this message I really needed it
Just in time for the royal rumble
Dean come back home soon, okay?
I swear, Justin Roberts will forever be one of the greatest Ring Announcers  No one could've delivered that "Jon Moxley" line better
I really wish he had his old theme before Wild Thing
So happy to see mox back
Man, He's noticeably thinner, fair play to him for getting clean.
Mox In Rumble  No #30
Welcome back
Can you imagine Mox and Punk as Heel duo beating the heck out of MJF?
There's obviously a lot of the real Jon in that promo, but bah gawd, that was a HELL of a promo. He's so damn cool.
Jon "the plumber " moxley.  The most BORING wrestler alive. Why does he walk through the crowd? No explanation and no one knows why.  Just plain dumb. Everything about him. 👎👎🤮
Love you mox
Well welcome home baby 😉💜👍
It would be good to put Moxley in a feud with CM Punk when he's done with MJF. Make the alcoholism aspect of things a part of the storyline with Punk being a straightedge heel.
Mox
He didn't change 😈 he still look that 😈
Hi
He looks a lil' bit different and I'm happy for him let's go
Go for it moxley , you got ya fire stoked , good to see ya back and on it man. Much respect from the U.K ✌️
What was that heckler saying?
I want "All I drink is Blood" as a Shirt!!!!
want punk and moxley together
Amazing promo
He was my favourite member of the Shield, he looks so healthy now. Good to see him back in AEW after his recovery 👏🏾
I’m so happy and proud of Jon, that he’s back and better then ever !! he looks so damn good and happy I love it . He looks In awesome shape. Don’t care what anyone says he’s straight bad ass.I’ll always support him No, matter what.That was, not Jon Moxley speaking that was Jonathan David Good speaking his truth.
Mox looks about 15 years younger.
Such a dead crowd, where's the pop!!
What an Amazing promo
Well that was one for the history books!
Jon Moxley, confirmed vampire
Tell it  Moxley
So happy for him. Welcome back, Jon.
Moxley is awesome
Welcome to a reality where cm punk and Jon moxley are in the same wrestling show this is kool welcome back Jon
Stone Cold would be proud!
What did the fan say?
It’s not ufc Jon
So  So happy to see Moxley back!
MoX MoX MoX so good to see him back 🔙 God bless you ♥ 😊 goat's 🆎 Blood
Getting a little Stone cold Steve Austin Vibe from moxley on AEW
That guy Boooing must be a Roman and Seth Fan?
I love this
He's the goddamn man! Welcome back, you were missed!
What did that guy say that Moxley wanted out?
i'm truly free  we got it boys a royal rumble entrance
What did the guy shout?
Inspiring for all those who are struggling. Chills. What a man for being so open about his recovery.
Wether it’s been on purpose or it’s just been organic, AEW is creating moments. So many wrestling companies don’t get that anymore. You need to create moments and history.
Welcome back, Jon. 😊
So happy to see him back but even happier knowing he's recovering for not just himself but his family
Here to make sure Mox gets a million views. I also don't run from demons, I run through em.  No more black clouds in a world full of color.
John Moxley is on another level. Awesome promo!!
Welcome back mox
Love the entrance, he throws a water bottle into the crowd and knocks some dudes sign down and the crowd still loves every minute
MoX is a real man 👨 happy for the wild thing
I truly wish Jon the best in his battle versus alcoholism. Stay strong, Jon!
After watching AEW last night something felt off. Let me start by saying i like AEW, I'm all for AEW. AEW is the true Alternative to Shitty Sports Entertainment. Back to my point, As I'm watch AEW i felt like somethings wrong and i went back and i saw some of their other videos of the week and stuff and it finally hit me. I have no idea WTF am i watching. Let me explain. You got a guy like Eddie Kingston who is over as shit in a program against Daniel Garcia and 2.O but you have him on one of your dark youtube peograms fighting joe the plumber who has barley 3 matches under his belt and the match does nothing to progress kingstons program with garcia and 2.O. Then on dynamite you have random people being the main event, over people that have developed programs. I'm sorry as much as sting tickles my nostalgia him and hottopic robin have no business in the main event this week. Especially when they have spent 2 weeks fighting the Acclaim on rampage. Yet the people who are the most over with the fans cole and brit are curtain jerkers, this week. Just to main event next week? Something isn't right there. Still that didn't feel like the issue and when i was about to call it quits it finally dawned on me the champions of the show feel lost in the shuffle.
hee look like not moxley look like amborse
Will someone change his entrance music!!!!!!
Happy to see Mox like that! I Hope his demons will leave him alone i know how it's difficult alcohol is a legal drug and when your addicted his shadow follows you
What the fan say ?
Who the hell is that dude that keeps shouting? Even on Cody's promo.
One day at the time Good Jon, Good for him. We all know these are not demons you beat but that you fight to a stand still and in that we can move to a better place.
That is what you call a promo
Thank you Mox.  People who struggle with addictions of all kinds can be inspired by your words.
It really shows you the visual effect alcohol has on the human body. Before Mox left his face was going puffy and blue. He looks tremendous now.
Awesome return by Jon Moxley on Dynamite this is return is awesome and this is promo is awesome and i love see him come back in AEW 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lol only Mox first words back could be hey go F yourself lol love this guy. I want to see the panick backstage trying to beep it before it makes air
Welcome back, Moxley!
Been fighting alcohol for 20 years, glad to see you back
I have gotten so used to seeing him look like a tank that he almost looks weird now
A small portion of the crowd was a complete embarrassment. Bunch of hecklers that thought they were “cool” for being childish and interrupting promos throughout the show. Right from the very start of the show with Mox and until Cody’s promo.
This was amazing
Mox is a legend
Who likes him when he was dean ambrose?
That was Stone Cold esque
Deam Ambrose 🥲y’all stop calling him joh 🥺
What did the guy in the crowd say
New generation stone cold Steve Austin
When he said "I am truly free" that hit strong
Ladies and Gentleman JJJJEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNN MMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOXXXXXLLLLEEEEEYYYYY
Welcome back to AEW, Jon Moxley! 🥲
I just recovered from alcoholism myself so i know exactly what he means by demons. Sometimes you gotta dig deep within to be re inspired by something else other than a buzz. Mines was working out and football.
What did the fan yell?
That’s the first time I think I’ve seen a crowd fall silent from somebody speaking ever since the first Smackdown after 9/11
Ayyyyyyy!
I'm so happy for him 🥰
What a comeback!
Proud of Mox for getting the help he needed. He looks 7 years younger too. 👏🏼💪🏽
Moxley Jericho Punk MJF Cody and Kingston promos so good I can rewatch them over and over like their new
❤️
Wrestling comes second, I'm just glad he's doing better. Addition is a bitch.
For anyone who didn't hear what that fan said to him at the beginning  'get this drunken piece of trash out the ring’
If you guys are happy to see the return of Jon moxley, give me a wild thing!!!!
By god welcome back Jon Moxley. I've been honestly in need of a motivational speech for weeks and this puts every TedTalk out there to shame
You absolutely. Fucking. Love. To see it.
I thought he woke up before he could answer the demon so when did he tell him to shove it
OMG I’m crying again watching this. Thank you Mox. He was the reason why I started watching Aew. I love the heck out of this man. Welcome back! It was never the same without you.
Wb mox
it was nice surprise to see Hornswoggle in the crowd 5:46
Great to see him back. am I the only one who feels Wild thing feels too tame and cartoonish a theme for Moxley though?
Welcome back Mox, those demons stood no fuckin' chance 👊  Love how when he starts talking, the crowd goes dead quiet.
Best Mox
Dude this would pop if was a surprise haha
I wonder if Jake Roberts was watching that and saying, with a tear in his eye, good on you Mox , you conquered your demons . Cause i sure was . Its great to see Mox back and healthy
Ok ok hear me out. I absolutely love jon moxley, he's literally probably my favorite in aew but what is the thought process behind the entrance music? It just doesn't fit
so we cant see jon moxley at royal rumble？？
Every so often professional wrestling goes beyond being entertainment or goes deeper than that because professional wrestlers unlike actors are there as them and the person they are even if it is an amped up version of themselves. What we have here is a prime example of this as Jon Moxley is Jon Moxley this isn’t a gimmick this the real man. Professional wrestlers often can be so inspiring to others in ways others can’t as we see them week in and week out no special effects no second takes no editing it’s them in the ring doing what they love. We also see them go through the same problems and life altering things we do and we see them battle their demons in a very open way. To see Jon Moxley return from this a healthier man and to say no one should be afraid to bare their selves is a huge thing to say as so many people can’t for fear of ridicule or rejection but when they see Jon Moxley doing that in a very open way it can gives them the strength and the inspiration to do that. This why I always have and always will feel professional wrestling is different than anything else because of the realness at it’s core and real people doing want they love and real fans loving what they do.
2019: Roman Reigns had a huge standing ovation  2022: Jon Moxley now got a huge standing ovation
“GEEEYAAAHHNNN MOXLEEEEEYY!”
I'm so happy to see him. I'm crying
Great and inspiring promo. Words to live by. I still don’t like him as a wrestler.  Very poor delivery on his promos and mediocre ring work at best.
A small arena like this sold is so much better than a 10000 seater that is half full. It sounds so much more energetic
That was a dumb ass promo
Why is this baldy free actually!!??
Hate arrogant comments like this, he just got out of rehab, you have beaten nothing, be humble and stop talking in these terms, take every day as a step, you don't beat things like this, you can relapse or slip.
Can someone explain to me what he went through ??
The NY's badass guy :)))
the cincy kid is back good to see mox again
He look like Dean Ambrose 😂❤
He look like he in better shape than ever I hope he became Aew Champion one day
Just glad he is back  and hopes he keeps fighting the demons
It's kinda appropriate that the first words we hear from him in months he's telling someone "to f**k yourself" 😂😂  Great to see you back Mox. Glad you're happy and healthy again.
I'm so glad he's back and better than ever
2:29 anybody know what the imbecile in the audience said? All I got was after 3?
He looks better then ever. It is soooo good that he is back!
Wild thing 🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸
Willow to aew confirmed
I feel like the pop could’ve been *waaaay* louder
Royal Rumble nr30
Your a legend mox! Well done fighting the black dog! From Qld , Australia!
As someone who went in and recovered in rehab - I know that look in his eyes and Moxley is about to be Wrestler of the Year 2022!
love moxley♥️🥀from nepal🇳🇵
A promo from the heart! So glad Jon Moxley is back, he's gonna kick a whole lot of ass!
I am not and was never a fan of Jon Moxly but darn he's got a lot of heart.
How quiet everyone was, captivated. Respect it
Moxley vs Hook
MOx and @arsenal till I die
Dude comes back and gives a serious promo of the year contender just like that 🔥🔥🔥 You can tell he feels better too. You cant script none of this pure emotion no matter the company
What did that guy say at 2:30 ?
"I'm thirsty". "And all I drink is blood"!!!! That's how you end a promo.👏👏👏
He looks and sounds more like Dean Ambrose again.
I'm so fkn happy for you my brother, I've been thru the same kind of hell, and guess what? I have 16 years free of those nasty demons, love you Mox, and love wrestling, and love AE FKN W !!!!!!😎👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Who’s that? Is it Evan Williams? Is it Jim Beam? Is it Johnny Walker? Is it Jack Daniels? No, it’s 100 proof Jon Moxley! Looking like your grumpy neighbor after an argument with his wife.
I liked it how everybody listend to him a good speach brings you bk down to earth. 👍😁
Wow
and number 30 in the royal rumble IS
I agree it wasn't a promo he did bare his soul and I believe the fans knew it because they where so quite and listening like they where really quiet as he talked..mox will be champion again.
2:35
Royal rumble 2022
Looking like old Dean Ambrose.
Someone cutting onions in here?
We missed you Mox....
Moxly is over hyped sanvab*** 🤣 he thinks he is somebody, just crazy psychopath.. Talk too much 😂
Let the ass whoopings begin, moxley is baaaaaaaaaacccccccckkkkkk
Hell of a promo
Welcome Back to Pro Wrestling Jon Moxley. You're an inspiration to me 🔥❤️
Jon moxley ❤⚘
3:58 - that moment of silence... the crowd really cared about mox. youre not alone mox!
Moxley looks like he lose weight. He is in good spirits
2:34 You can't get any more "Moxley" than that. They censored it on here but not on TV.
I am so tired of seeing people in there face diapers.
welcome back
I honestly thought Jon Moxley would be gone for more than two years. I'm just gonna assume he's still in rehab, just allowed to go out more often.
Best promo in AEW forsure
I love john moxly
Punk needs to lose.... you said you came to help new talent....
He looks so healthy, great to see him back!
Thank you Jon. These days I feel like absolute shoot, your speech was a pad on the shoulder and some balm on my own scars.
Mox vs. Bryan Danielson. Book it, Tony!
I wish Moxley would just tell us all how he *~REALLY~* feels though
Moxleyy moxleyyy is backk in good shapee in good mental state lets goooo
Is he drunk??
This promo was awkward . Check Moxleys water bottle.
Fucking awesome!!
There is a line that fans should not cross. What a disrespectful person.  How embarrassing.  If you go to a event Don't tell stupid shit. Just cheer or boo .leave the shit talking to the wrestlers.
That was next level. Moxley truly is an inspiration. Welcome back!
What an inspirational speech , heart felt and honest
Like 👍 if YOU are watching in 2 0 2 2 🎆
04:40" Nobody's perfect . If everybody was perfect the world will be a very boring place ". - Jon Moxley
Jim Ross is in remission, Punk and MJF are on an absolute tear, and Dean Ambrose just stole the heart of every wrestling fan young to old. Man it feels great to be a wrestling fan right now
Great 2 c Jon Moxley back. Who's ready 2 challenge him
2:30 “Get this drunken piece of trash out of the ring.” -Some piece of trash thrown out of the building.
Feels awesome to see Jon Moxley back!! And plus, he's in the great shape of his life! :D
Big show Chris jericho should team up
Welcome Back Moxley! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
No offense but needing rehab honestly means you lost the battle to self control. Not really kicking any ass other than your own.
He's not through it, it's still a loooooong way
What a moment. 😭
Is it me or has he lost a lot of weight? In the best way possible?
What an epic promo mox
Was there some c*nt booing Mox?
Don't mind me I'll just be openly weeping
Why do I see some Nick Fn Gage in Mox?
He looks great compared to his last appearance
Only thing more intimidating than a Jon Moxley fighting his demons, is a focused Jon Moxley who can get through anything in life. Welcome back Mox!!!
Let’s hope he can’t keep it professional now!
I'm thirsty these days all i drink is blood 👏👏👏
Welcome back, love you and proud of you! 🤟🏼💙🔥
The dude is amazing on the mic, a fantastic return
The demon that was following jon was Ryuk.
What the person on the crowd said to Moxley ?
Awesome promo, deep and meaningful, soooo pleased to see Mox back beating those demons 💪
This gave me goosebumps! So proud of him, I've been alcohol free for 12 years, it's been hard as hell but I'm so glad I got it out of my life and I'm absolutely certain Jon can only get better and stronger from here.
He's back
Moxely 😍
What happened with the "get this guy out of here" ???
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯😤😤😤💪🏽
I kinda wish Moxley would stay away from the ring for a while and spend time at home with Renee and his new baby born daughter but good to see him back again
Finally the champ has arrived!!!!!
Welcome back 🏡
I love AEW 💘 I LOVE JON MOXLEY
El borracho
He's obviously getting worse. He just seems like a regular joe now. No physique nothing. This was crap. Miro is better.
We need a Mox vs Punk promo
All i drink is blood promo - Jon Moxley 2022 ✅
That’s dean Ambrose
Justin Roberts has been waiting forever to scream his hame again
He speaks of demons but needs to remember the one who can cast them out. Put on the armor of God
JON "UNSCRIPTED SON OF A GUN VIOLENCE" MOXLEY
Welcome Back Jon x
Great to see him in recovery and back, but I'll never understand the hype around this guy, he's like a nerd trying to be hard, hilarious.
Mox is clear-headed and ready to go to war.  This is going to be a great year.
Jon Moxley looks younger then before he is healthy he fight for the best and he is back.....What's next for Mox he is ready to kick some ass......Mox is back and he is better than ever.....🔥🔥🔥
This is why you CANT hand a wrestler a script,  VINCE
“Try to tear us apart, but know that we’ll wear our SCARS!!” - I Prevail.
LET'S F'N GO!! 2022 is going to be a hell of year for wrestling fans!
Swearing on live TV.... 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Legend
Interesting Jacket
What was that guy saying to which Jon replied, "Get that guy out of the arena" ?
Bring back his old theme song
for the love of god get rid of "wild thing" for his music and go back to the original entrance theme
So he’s a vampire now?
"Get the garbage truck and get this trash out the ring" quality human right there
What did that guy said???
Welcome back mox this promo reminds me of the promos he put out when he started in aew
He lost a lot of weight
Jon moxley 🔥
As man, brother, wrestler, champion, father, & hardcore king in ever
J ♥️😚😘 5:54 ♥️
He should be back in Royal rumble 😍
Welcome Back Mox. The silence when he is talking. Anyone paying respect to him i love it.
Best guy in the world 💙💥
Jon moxley that man is back
So happy to see the Mox back and he’s doing great. By god how I missed Justin roberts introduction of mox
Looking 20 younger. So glad to see him back.
Shades of Dean Ambrose, Not moxley, maybe royal rumble return
hell of a promo
Jon moxley VS CM Punk  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
A little bit of VSM in the front row, you love to see it. Firm handshakes.
Welcome back Mox!🤙🏻
Sounded pretty generic to me
Fantastic heartfelt and legitimate promo. Looking in good shape and fresh. Good on you Mox!
It’s the scars we carry inside that make us who we are. This touched me, not the alcoholism but everything with your mental health. I appreciate you man. Don’t take life for granted anyone. Keep going Jon. 🙌🏻
Such a humble crowd. Welcome back Jon
Moxley vs punk 🤔👌
Welcome back,mox!
i reckon my dream feud would be Moxly, Punk and Darby Allen vs MJF Spears and Wardlow
He has lost quite some weight...
plz come in the rumble
Welcome back Mox. Can’t wait to watch you again.   0:09. Good old Justin Roberts. Once more for old times sake. We love Justin as well.
I use to drink a lot of alcohol I went from drinking 2 to 3 beers to a 12 packs every single day and seening this man wrestling made me stop I made realize that life is greater than beer thank MOX!!!
You know you could listen to this promo up until 3:45 (where I got to ) and apply it to life (turned out to be the entire promo) but real question, maybe it's too deep, but I almost sense a bray Wyatt aew moment, could be a double antandra on demon
And can we please give kudos to Justin Roberts for that EPIC return introduction!!
Roman Reigns is better
Nice speech Mox... everyone have to fight his deamons. Greatings from Germany... AEW Rocks :)
Good to see him hopefully ok with everything he went through. Secondly, need to get rid of that goofy af song as his theme
Mox looking amazing, super happy he's back...
Thank you moxley
Wow He described demonic oppression.  Exactly how they talk to you when your try to break free according to my research.  As long as he remembers. You can’t kick a demons @$$ by yourself.
Imagine getting hit by that water bottle
F* cking yesssss, he is BACK
Damn he became a vampire
AEW is so lame.
He said it he's FREE jon moxley for the ROYAL RUMBLE CONFIRMED
Jon is on a road to progress and the progress may not be perfect. It is usually when the demons fight the hardest to hit you down. I know that Jon is strong and he can do it. Just by looking at tonight, his physical health and his mental health has definitely improved since the last time I saw him on tv. I’m so proud of him and I hope that he continues to fight this with ease.
Captain Kirk: KAAAAAHN!    Anouncer: JOOOOOOOOOON!
Jon moxely in royal rumble 2022
What did the guy in the crowd yell at moxly?
Mox is truly one of the current GOAT.
rip to the guy who got hit by that bottle lol
Elsewhere, two brothers are pointing their fist to their tv screen saying "welcome back Brother"
Sermon of mox.
Mox did the most Hardcore, Deathmatch shit ever.... getting better for himself and for his family. Can't get anymore Hardcore than that! Good for you, Mox.
He’s the real deal, no doubt about it.
They should bring back his old theme song, and have him fight HangmanAdamPage
Still a Steve Austin Jake Roberts wannabe to me. Overrated like Reigns. Let see f he puts anyone over in AEW or more super Moxley.
My dude is back. 😎
7:03 My new motto
Crowd goes mild
Moxley has some tattos
I love how he dealt with that piece of sh*t
So happy to see mox back and hes looking much better, cant blame a lot of the guys in wrestling to end up with drug and alcohol problems considering what they out themselves through week in week out for us! Well done mox 🤘💪
Welcome back 😊💪!
The Censored Bleeping F-Bomb was Heard CLEAN ON THE AIR!
What did the heckler say?
Don Mox is clearly better than both Roman and Rollins. He is a Rockstar.
Dear commentators, shut up and let us enjoy the entrances!
lmao perfect way to start get some idiot off the arena, deserved
He is looking soo fit. Welcome back Mox. and the last line ‌‌‌‌‌‍‍‍"These days all I drink is blood" That tells everything
Wow! Mox looks great! And the crowd was very quite and listening. Much respect!
Watched it live and they didn't bleep out when he said the F word was great. They definitely need a 30 sec delay when it comes to Mox on the 🎤
Love you Jon moxley  😘😘
Welcome back Jon! Glad that you made it back through rehab and overcame your demons and beat the shit out of them! We all have our own demons, but no matter how hard those demons knock you down, you get right back up! This goes out to anybody who has the same struggles that Jon had, your not alone and you can beat the shit out of your demons too and conquer them no matter who or what you are. No matter what, don't take shit from anybody on what they think about you! Stay strong and keep fighting where ever you are in the world. Once again, welcome back Johnny boy!🤘🤘🤘
Welcome ♥ Back Champ💪
Hell of a promo!
Welcome home Jon! You look great! Stay in your moment and breathe! God bless. Lots of love,light and prayers sent to you...
I am sorry. But Jon Moxley sucks.
he needs to lose that crappy song or get a better version.
What a promo by Mox 🔥
Salute to moxley being back
Jon Moxly is back and looking better than ever. Conquering his demons and beating their butts really good. He truly been to hell and back again. He didn’t listen to those lying demons. God give him strength to keep kicking those demons butts. So happy he’s back a looking so good and healthy. God bless him. All of his opponents better watch out .
Most welcome moxley
This how a wrestler or should I say a human should be treated. When they're down with their demons they should get help and get back a better/happier version of them rather than being fired for asking to be treated or worse commiting suicide fighting the demons themselves without expressing it. Welcome back MOX, certainly happy to see a better you!
2:30 what was the guy shouting?
Jon moxely very soon they will be AEW mans champion  & jeff hardy with  there feud for AEW CHAMPIONSHIP will be awesome in very soon in all elite wrestling
Jon Moxley is 10x better than Dean Ambrose. I just don't see him as a top guy. Just my $.02
its all scripted bullshit.
My champion Moxley🙌🧘‍♂️
Incredible that the place was silent and listening to every word he said. Welcome back Moxley, we missed you!
Why the camera quality is so trash even on 1080p???
Jion Moxley finally come back
👎👎👎👎
Great to see him back
Welcome home Mox ❤️
Jon Moxley for the world championship
a storyline between Mox and Malakai Black as the demon (black cloud) in his dream would be somethin. Nice to see Mox healthy and motivated!
WILD THING!!
What an asshole that "fan" in the crowd was. Why buy tickets to a show just to throw shade and hate? Also the guy who tackled Seth on Raw about a month ago.
I'm so happy Jon moxley really miss u man  is back 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
5:39 *Doomslayer approved*
I hope he has truly taken the time he needs. Welcome back Mox. Stay strong in your daily battle.
The Stone Cold vibes are back baby
What a promo. He looks brilliant.  AEW is killing it
Imagine when he mentioned kickin demon’s ass and Bray Wyatt appears.
Mox looks great. I havent heard a vivid promo like this in a long time from him. Good job!!!
Also bet rehany  his wife is so much happier now.  Seeing her man going full throttle again.
Mox reminds me of GTA V’s Trevor. And that is awesome.
Great to see Mox back in the ring. Thanks to AEW for giving him the freedom to speak his heart out rather than asking him to follow a so called script... Looking forward to all the great matches he can have with the other big names in this stacked roster...Love from India🇮🇳
What was the heckling guy shouting at the beginning..? Couldn‘t really hear it.
OMG! Jon Moxley is back  yahoooo!!!!
Mox looks amazing
Also a pure speak from heart there, why mox is a light house to people in need.
That promo just crushed every wrestling fan's heart 🔥🔥
Good to see my favorite wrestler back in the ring and healthy.
Turn Punk heel and have him feud with Mox
Always good see out boy mox.  The fact tony karn was behind him going to rehab shows you hiw much  aew are a family.  There wiling to let major talent go to other companys and help them out and also alow tallent months to go into rehab to get mentaly fit.    It why aew will always be my home.
"If everybody was perfect the world would be a very boring place." - MOX 🔥🙌🙌🙌
Terrible promo, terrible wrestler. Moxley is really awful, pure trash.
That was one hell of a fucking promo, Mox!
Jon's music sucks
He looks so rejuvenated! He reminds me of his time in Puerto Rico over 15 years ago. Good for him! 💪
Black demon??? Bit racist….         It was a joke.
It’s insane how over Jon Moxley still is as a face in AEW after almost 3 years.   Huh, who would’ve thought consistent and non-restrictive booking of an incredibly popular star would lead to a loyal connection with your audience.
Good to see Dean Ambrose 🤣
This Story telling a1 1st place I’m fired up
When Moxley speaks, everyone is silence. That's respect.
Did he got slimmer?
Mox look skinny 👀
That promo was the best promo after someone's return
His voice changes?
The heart and soul of AEW has returned. Welcome back MOX!
is this hint about Moxley or Dean  Ambrose in royal rumble 2022 ?
Damn I missed Mox
Did anybody understand what the guy at 2:27 was shouting?
Welcome Back Mox
2018 looks are back. Guy is aging backwards.❤️
He looks healthier, cleaner. Happy for him and his family
Who else thought he was gonna announce his entry into the royal rumble???
He looks great. Now only if he'd go back to using Unscripted Violence instead of Wild Thing for his entrance.
Welcome back big boy nice word of inspiration there
Alcoholism is the demon, admitting and asking for help is the cure, stay focused MOX!
Yes jon u look amazing
Great to have the Mox back
Monster 💪💪💪❤️
There's always that one guy in a any crowd that acts like a tough guy, booing Jon Moxley and shouting 'get that drunk idiot out of the ring' and Moxley destroying him, but I could still hear him booing when Moxley finished his promo and his theme played
Which means JON IS IN THE ROYAL RUMBLE
So Mox has won his most recent feud against his most dangerous opponent. Never give up.
What did the fan say?
He needs to shave his head his hair is doing him no favours anymore!
What a promo
This promo is gold ♥️
Mox looks incredible, it's great to see him back on AEW TV.
Wishing... he become world champion again
I am so, happy for jon moxely is healthy and come back in his arena
That fan being disrespectful as shit should be ashamed of himself.
2:30 what the hell was the heckler even saying?
WELCOME BACK MOX!!!!!
You could hear a pin drop in the crowd everyone is so focused
So glad to see Moxley back! Can't wait to see him kick ass again!
The Mox came back better than ever after conquering his demons. That promo was a message to anyone who's going through a hard time.
I like jon but what and why is this music
Welcome back, Moxley! He looks well!   Just one thing that was lacking about this mental health speech, and that was outside help. If you can't yell at your demons, if you can't beat them up on your own, get help, ask friends, ask professionals, to lend you a hand and train you to beat those mofos up!
Moxley is a badass i love him
Moxly return to Royal rumble
Good he's back but this music sucks balls so hard ..
MOX is look fresh and new  "you are as beautiful as the day I lost you"
I am getting vibes of My favourite Dean Ambrose ❤️
I run a nonprofit called Metta Association and I fight for mental wellness, recovery, and against recidivism. I beat addiction and bipolar to help others. This promo really fired me up. Thank you From Garland, TX!!!!!!!
Jon Mox v CM Punk anyone?
0:52 it cracks me up every time Mox does shit like this lol
What did that heckler say? Just head boo and something about trash?
can someone exactly explain me what actually happened to moxley..i have no idea
Royal rumble appearance confirmed 😘😘
AEW should do TED talk segments
Mox entrance is like entrance of UFC or Boxer
I‘m hyped for Moxley vs Homicide
Actually, he told that demon "Security, get him outta here!" Ha.
Goosebumps. Welcome back Mox.
Demons are real
"...All these day I drink is blood!" DANG! THAT"S A BOMB! I literally stunned with that punchline!
Can anyone tell me why he was gone (both kayfabe and real reasons)?? I haven’t been keeping up with wrestling
Roman and Seth rn: that's our boy!
Other than kicking out some unknown spectator, I slept thru the entire promo. He shd just stop doing promos and randomly beat ppl up backstage
what did the guy in the crowd yell?
Is he having cancer or something?
It’s awesome to see Jon Moxley back in AEW and that promo was the greatest promo from Moxley in my opinion
Mox vs Bryan vs hangman
Absolute legend
This is the best AEW moment of all time!!!! I have a new level of respect for Jon Moxley!!!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏
He looks younger than before. Maybe it's because he trimmed his bushy beard😂
'all I drink is blood' this guy can cut one hell of a babyface promo. Guy is fire on the mic.
Welcome home Mox
Looks like Jon Moxley has returned in a better place than before. I can't wait to see what 2022 brings to the table for him!
Did Jon look on fire and in such great spirits! Love seeing you back Mox, thanks for everything and looking forward to the journey ahead!
Moxley The best❤️
Jox moxley vs adam cole
I love how the crowd was absolutely silent for when Mox was talking
all this cuz he stopped drinking !  damn what about me who don't drink or smoke  and don't do drugs
Jox looking like how he looked back in the shield days
That uncensored F bomb was a Masterpiece
Major love and respect for a great and strong and inspiring fighter he's always been my favorite
Well Lets go Moxley!
Just change your very very boring entry song...trust me..that is killing ur vibe slowly...Anyway so happy u back
👏👏👏👏
Hope that dude who disrespected Mox got the everliving shit kicked out of him.
Moxley please come to Rumble ❤️
Moxley looks like Jesse pinkman😂😂
Shield reunion 😂😂😂
Next royal rumble come back 🙏🙏 Dean Ambrose please next royal rumble
I really liked the wiry lanky Ambrose, with his long dirty hair, he was portrayed as a dangerous man who didn't take himself seriously. Now he's just a try hard. I'm happy he's back and healthy though
Boss: "pls, do not overact at entrance" Mox "Ok, i walk as natural as i can"
Tough guy Mox trying to get a guy thrown out.
Moxley 😈😈😈😈
My soul needed that 🖤👊💀⛓️
Will he come to the royal rumble
Daun
Welcome back MOX and that Jacket remind me of when he was Dean Ambrose!
This has to go down as the most bad ass inspirational speech in HISTORY
He looks healthy 😊
6:15 ❤
He's not going to be in royal rumble you marks
Still stupid entrance music.
Welcome Back Moxley!
Welcome back Legend looks better than ever so happy to see him back
Anyone a bit disappointed Danielson didn’t interrupt? These two need a feud
This might be the promo of the year and it’s only January
The year just started and already we have the best promo of the year... i think nothing can top this... and the fact that the crowd was so silent and listening to everything Moxley said is empowering my statement... never seen a wrestler deliver a promo this good and real so the crowd stays quiet like this and listens
Mox' promo should be a PSA! 🙃🙂
Omg. He looks great 🤩
Masterpiece
When he took off his jacket I don't know why but i kinda got vibes of William fichtner  his character of alex mahone from prison break  I don't know why they don't even sound same but i kinda got the same vibes
Moxley doesn't look good..something is wrong guys..
That, "Last Fears Toppings", sign... 🤣
He looks malnourished to me, but I'm glad to see him back ❤️
He comes back and the first thing he does is throw something at the crowd and risk hitting an unsuspecting fan. They really are asking for a lawsuit aren’t they?
Jon Moxley 👑
Jon Moxley is back ..we love you mox 👍👍
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Anyone realise that this promo goes back to when Seth Rollins said “without The Shield, Ambrose will end up face down in a ditch”. I wonder if Mox deliberately thought about that…  He looks so much better and healthy since losing that Phil Mitchell bloat from the alcohol.
Welcome Back Moxley. We Miss You
No one: Justin Roberts: JIIIOOOOONNNNNNNNNNN MOXXXXXLEYYYYYY
Nice to see Mox back again
Ive seen the Cloud. And i walkes through the storm. God bless you, MOX. You arent alone fighting these demons...none of you are.
am i the only one that gets dean ambrose vibes from his body language? not at all memeing just felt like dean wandering the ring not mox.
Road is a long one but taking the first step is the hardest.
Oiioii jon
He is back wow 😍🔥🔥🔥
Dim light😠😠😠
we are less than 3 weeks in and I already think this is possibly promo of 2022
The king is back to home 🔥 🔥
Knowing the Internet. They're reaction would be hey, was it the demon black huh
I felt all that🙌🏾
Thr Maestro of Mayhem has returned! He has returned and he is better than ever!
The whole place went dead quiet once Mox started speaking, that's power right there... Like Damn Jon🙆🏾‍♂️
Denam roj😍😍😍
Good seeing him back.
glad to see mox back though I didn't miss his shit theme
Jon Moxley 💪💪💪
Rock on Jon.
Wow!👏👏👏👏👏😘welcome back Jon mox we missed you so much 😭 thank God for speedy recovery. I stop watching@Aew wrestling because you were not there but am back now
Mox looking small
Whoever said wild thing doesn't work.   Well they were wrong
My boy ...welcome back💜🇹🇹🙏🤗
Love to see him back and looking healthy. Big shout out to Justin Roberts, hell of an intro for Mox. You can tell he wanted to do it right
Mox returns my interest in aew also returned 😀😂
Jon Moxley in Dean body  You know something crazy shit would happen next !! PARADIGM SHIFT all the way !!
That "I'm thirsty" is my favourite line honestly
That heckler is like "booo, trash. Get a Garbage truck & get that piece of trash out of the ring". That was great.. 😄
Mex
Moxley is my favourite wrestler. I'm so happy he's back, he beat his demons and now he looks healthy again! His promo was once again fantastic and I see big things coming for him again!
Welcome back the best man in the world happy birthday happy to you to see that
He looked drawed up...needs to get his wrestling weight back up. He had gotten bigger before this rehab happened...now he looked really small.
That was no promo, that was a call to inspiration.
I really resonated with everything Moxley was saying. He really brought me to emotion and tears. Welcome back Jon.
This will remain one of the greatest moments of 2022.
🔥
I miss Dean Ambrose
Epic entrance,so great to see you back Jon Moxley.
Masks everywhere 🤣 freaks
So so glad to see Mox back. This promo was incredible.
What the guy say
Good to have mox back u shouldnt be thirsty you should have that ITCH. WELCOME BACK AND HAVE A GOOD CONFIRMATION FROM HERE ON OUT
Go John...
jeaaaaaan moxly
That random guy Sure sounded like jim Cornett sure happy Moxley is back 💪
Aew cares about their performer
The amount of respect these people had for him...the whole place is silently listening except for one hater and the cheers. Wow!  I do miss his Dean Ambrose longer hairstyle though.
I didn't catch it....what did that idiot "fan" yell at Mox?
He’s my favourite love him to bits
Heckler said "get a garbage truck and that drunken piece of trash out of the ring" - I agree with mox. Screw that goof.
We love Mox!
FINALLLYYY MOX IS BACKKK IN THE BUSINESSS!!!!!💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Respect for Moxley...It takes a lot of courage and a lot of balls to fight your demons...
JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON MOOOOOXLEY!
Moxley sucks dean Ambrose doesn't sucks
Justin Roberts been waiting a while huh lmao
Good good good job moxley
It’s great to see him back in AEW, and the way he dealed with the heckler was awesome! Welcome back, Mox!
S.H.I.E.L.D 👊👊👊
Is it me or does he look more… unhinged.. no matter. Welcome back Jon Moxley. Go take back what is yours
MOX jus show up at the Royal Rumble and steal the whole F'n show lol
This time his is looking like dean Ambrose of shield .
So good seeing him back
This man will come between head of table and Seth Rollins oooo I sense it coming
ROLLINS & REIGNS BETTER THAN THIS DRUNKLEY
Fux yeah Mox!!!  This guy is the best in professional wrestling……….. PERIOD!!!
I'll drink to that
AEW should introduce a Hardcore Championship belt or sth .. that would be 💯
The fact that everyone was silent when Jon was talking just shows how much he is respected and loved. WELCOME HOME JON MOXLEY!
🍺🍺🍺 drink to that 🤣🤣🤣
Dean ambrose jacket
Welcome back mox. Can't wait to see what 2022 brings
Anyone know what the fan said? I can't make it out
Stone cold cos play.
Suddenly I feel very sorry for Homicide at GCW at the weekend...
Jon Moxley says he drinks blood  R Truth: I dont even know if thats PG
Does anybody know what the fan said? Love that they didn't edit the response in time.
JIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNN MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOXLEY !!!  And it works also for Jeff Hardy and Cena !  WELL DONE JUSTIN ! AND Welcome Back Mox !
Mox!  Welcome back from NFSEC.  Now I think I'd like a little violence.
He looks so much better health wise
Royal rumble winner of 2022
OMG is wild thing his new theme i love that xD
I was shocked to find out a few days or so after getting his book that he needed to go to rehab to fix his alcohol problems, but I'm glad now to see him back in AEW and looking healthy and everything... Can't wait now to see what he's got planned for this year
Great to see mox back
Royal Rumble back deanabrose 😭😭😭😭
The respect the crowd gives this man by staying silent while he speaks is incredible. Minus that douche who heckled .
Welcome back Jon Moxley 🔥🔥
i'd reckon most people wouldn't get the payoff of addressing a heckler like that.
Dean. Look. Good.
I guess no more royal rumble return
I love Moxley's train-to-go attitude always ready to whup some ass glad to see my dude back👏👏👏👏
AEW is becoming boring nowadays. I swear this dynamite sucks. 70% are storylines full of talking shit. 30% matches that are boring and disappointing mostly cm punk vs shawn and lol this cole vs cassidy storyline is should be done now. Aew is becoming a RAW show that storylines about rematches every week
Crazyyyyy
That wasn't a promo.  That was an honest man humbled being transparent about something that nearly killed him.  He also looks great by the way.  I'm sure Renee was sobbing tears of joy.  His child should be proud of her daddy.
welcome back mox
I'm so fucking thrilled and so fucking excited to see Mox again
Jyooooooooooon Mmmoxley
Weak.....mox is weak!
A legennd is back😭😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Day 3 : where’s Jay Lethal
Dean Ambrose 🤔
What happen to Him? Why does He leave?
Moxleys look is awesome
How to deal with hecklers like a boss 😎. Welcome back you crazy SOB  😃
What did that guy say
I love this man ❤️
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥
yes dean ambrose is back
Looks healthier.. Glad to see him 💙
I'm been through the hardest year of my life in the past 13 months. From being in hospital with Covid in december 2020 , to losing the love of my life and the person that I thought was going to be my future wife because of it. I was in the same job for 8 years until 6 months ago. But I've accept and lost 3 others since from ill health and bad mistakes by myself over recent months through depression. If it wasn't for my best friend then i would most likely be homeless in a month as well. I too feel like Ive been battling the as  Jon, but I felt inspired seeing him walk to the ring as it felt like he was walking in my shoes.  Classic, real promo.
Looking forward to Mox back in action Friday. I think time off helps any wrestler, I know why he had to leave but I really think all wrestlers should get a two month hiatus. It makes their return special and they can rest up their body and mind. Along with being at home with family.  I really like the smaller venues over the bigger half empty ones. The only downside is you hear some clown that thinks they are getting their fifteen minutes. You paid for your ticket and that entitles you to cheer/boo, but stfu with trying to get yourself over. I would like the clown to become a mime.
I have never had a promo get me emotional. And I damn sure didn't think high energy jon moxley would give a touching speech but God dammit he did it. This was a "you are not alone" speech except it was real and honest and raw and straight to the point. Yo mox, yo aew... good work!
he is not really aging very well since his shield day
Man he looks incredible when he is so lean and healthy
Wow 😍 Moxley is back 😍love Jon Moxley.
He was dangerous when drunk. He will be deadly when sober
Jon looks like a healthy human being again
See you at the rumble Jon
This promo was as real as it can get your an inspiration to alot of people including myself congrats my friend do great things buddy can't wait to see you as a champion again.
the fact aew kept that in the video is so fucking gangsta
Oh hell yeah Jon moxley
What an inspiration.
Is moxley's new gimmick a motivational speaker?
Great to see Moxley back and he's looking good
02:35 Get the hell.... 😅😁
Over actor
His first opponent should be MJF :O
Powerful words we should all strive to live by.   I know those scars he talks about far better than I should, and I know from experience that every single word he said in that ring tonight was 100% accurate. And the fire in his eyes... This is motivation.
Dude he looks so great!
Same as his jokey, cheesey, scripted promos he used to do at another promotion, right... The man is a promo machine, glad heis potential is no longer wasted over there, and hope he's okay outside the lights now
Awesome man 👍
It's Jonathan Good 😱😱
when that one dude finally returns to school and gets everybody pumped up
He look better
Jon Moxley is all of us
He's the 30th man in royal Rumble 😂😂
Welcome back mox!!
Mox looks leaner and somehow younger.  Wtf man. I just get older and fatter.
Welcome back mox
This is the promo you listen to for motivation in life 🔥🔥 Welcome back Mox love you brother!
Mox looking amazing and dropping a promo of the year like it's nothing! Welcome back, Jon!
Hangman can kick John toxley .
He so right 16 year gambler here haven't bet for 2 mouths now demons almost go feeling good.etc love the the Jon.moxley wild thing happy life is best
Music is cringe
Wild thing is his new theme?
Cry baby .......
Yesssssssssss 😍😍😍😍😍 Moxly is back
What’s wrong with him
I went to this tonight and it was so good! He’s been a favorite of mine for a while so I’m glad he’s back!
Pomo says it all he's going to be the first to cross Brand
Imagine getting hit by that water bottle
Silence never seen a crowd like that for this only when someone has passed away have seen a crowd drop into silence. For him to come out and talk about his issues or an issue he has suffered mentally hats off because it's hard really mentally
Hell yeah gotta be #1 man
This is my favorite wrestler of all time.
Damn, he looks better and healthier than he has in a VERY long time. I know what it means when your dad liked having one or two too many. I do not wish that to anyone, and certainly not to such a sympathetic family. So I'm really happy for him, but also for Rene and his child, that he got rid of the demons he had been carrying around with him for what seemed like a long time. May he be able to keep them off his back for good. I think his warning should be taken pretty seriously, because a Mox in this condition is definitely one of the absolute best of this generation and across all leagues of this sport. 🔥🤘🏻 _____________________ 【 _Our rock never dies ever. Forever!_ 】- from BAND-MAID 'Manners' 🕊️
Does he looks like Valterri Bottas..? Or just me jahahah
He looking like Dean Ambrose
Literally everyone should be over the moon to see Jon back. Been a massive fan since I saw him drunk and singing Sweet Caroline in CZW.   I say everyone, the guy in charge of the mic budget probably isn’t too happy.
what did that guy in the crowd say? couldnt make it out
What did that fan say to piss off Moxley?
King MOX is back hell yeah
Let’s be honest  cm punk isn’t the reason why aew become popular, jon moxley is.
THAT is Jon fuckin’ Moxley.
🤪
Hella motivation
I'm not sure that Mox will stay strong...demons can come back very fast...😪
Top guy is back
NICE MATCH... GOOD 😊👍😊👍😊 Jon  Moxley VS  Adam Cole Jon  Moxley VS  Adam Cole Jon  Moxley VS  Adam Cole Jon  Moxley VS  Adam Cole Jon  Moxley VS  Adam Cole Jon  Moxley VS  Adam Cole Jon  Moxley VS  Adam Cole
This. Was. An. Awesome. Moment. ❤️
OMG OMG Jon moxley is back 🔥🔥🤩
Moxley was The Last Man Standing     Vs Kenny...   Mox git Kenny beat up n falling over. Stumbling..   Then they cheated for KO for the   Title to be Taken...
Great to see him back. Shocked me when that F-bomb slipped through the cracks, hopefully they don't catch too much shit from the network for it.
I’ve been sober for almost 4 years. This got me emotional. I’m so proud of Mox
God damm Mox I love you so much. So happy your back
I love you, Mox!!! ❤
Yesss oh hell yeah he's back mox is back hell yeah let's go aew
Super Jon moxley  super
Great to see Moxley back but can we take a moment to appreciate the talent of how Justin announced him. He is such an amazing ring announcer
Welcome back mox your a amazing dude
He is little bit thin now..like ambrose
Thank you AEW for helping this guy. This is a different kind of company that doesn't just brush stuff under the rug. This is what separate the game from the game changers. What a a great lesson to display. This could've saved greats many wrestling legends careers and lives in the past... The other guys can get the F out because I'm all elite now (mic drop)
Mjf isway better n waybigger than u moxnox 💉
man, this is an inspiration for me to keep fighting against my own trouble with substance abuse
My heart is back 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕🥳🥳😘😍😍😘😍😘😍😘😘😘😘😘🥳😘😘🥳😘😘😘😍😘😍😍😍😘😍😘😘👍👍👍👍👍😘😍😘😍💕😘💕😘🤩🤩🤩🤩😘😍🥳😍😘😘😘😘😘🥳😘😘come on moxly
When he talked about personal demons that visit us in our dreams, he wasn't lying. We all get them as humans, and if you're young enough to not have them yet, you eventually will, because they stalk you since the day you are born into this world. Its these personal demons we must overcome to reach self-actualization according to Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory in his groundbreaking research "A Theory of Human Motivation" (Maslow, A.H., 1943). Pro Wrestling is not just fun, but also serves as inspiration and motivation for many fans in viewing and dealing with our own personal challenges in life. Others help us on our way toward solving these problems, and in turn we give back in helping others overcome theirs. Giving to others unconditionally is the greatest gift we can offer as human beings, and ultimately changes lives for the better in the long run, even if we are not around to see the fruits of our labors. In conclusion, I am joyful to see Mr. Moxley return, and we as professional wrestling fans will no doubt thoroughly enjoy his pugilistic exploits in the squared circle in the near future.
Over Acting
He looks great. Glad he's back.
It wasn't so much a Jon Moxley promo as it was a Jonathan Good promo. He put himself out there with nowhere to hide, all while simultaneously beseeching those listening to him  to be fearless in doing the same thing. Addiction is sinister and deadly. Every recovering addict/alcoholic who saw this felt proud to call Jon one of us. Godspeed Mox.
I fought that demon
This is the Moxley Stone Cold was asking to see on that Broken Skull Session.
Glad to have him back
Mox is back.
2:29 i hope that trash never get to attend live events ever
Royal rumble mei konse no pe aane ka plan hai
LFG MOXLEYYY
No more puffy face. That means he’s beating this poison this demon. Let’s go Mox!!!!
Windham's first target?? I know the demon represents what he's been through but idk I feel something here. Good to see Mox back though
Crowd of overweight marks I bet that Crowd could use deodorant smh
No lie, brought a bit of a tear to my eye
Dean Moxley Jon Ambrose is back 🔥🔥🔥🔥❣️
2:31 what did he say
now finally he came back in aew he could face cm punk,daniel bryan,hook,adamcole,bobby fish,,kyle oriely,adam page,
What did that guy in the crowd say ?
Moxley!!! Moxley!!! Moxley!!! Moxley!!! Moxley!!! Moxley!!! Moxley!!! Moxley!!! Moxley!!! Moxley!!! Moxley!!! Moxley!!!
Jon Moxley looks great! Glad he's back.
Anyone know what the heckler said ?
Mox is back! I want to see him win back the AEW world championship belt later this year or maybe he can become the next TNT champion...
He looks like wolverine
Moxley💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Congratulations Mox! You kicked those demons ass! Welcome Back!
Moxley seemed to have couple of pints of Guinness before the promo.
2:30 what does that guy in the crowd yell?
Moxley welcome back!!!
Welcome and soak it in Jyeooooooooooon Moooooxley
Jon Moxley is back 🔥🔥
Wow. One of the greatest mission statement promos of all time.
I feel you Jon , That’s what  make us champion💪🏽💪🏽 Face the darkness and tell it you don’t have control over me👍🏽
Finally!! o man I missed you alot king 👑💖
What did the guy in the crowd say?
@All Elite Wrestling GO BACK TO MOXLEYS OLD MUSIC NOW
Whooooooooooooooo. I'm so excited.
I understand the black clouds of demons. I carried them for many years. After those year's of despair, grief, evil, they knocked on the door of my soul. Been sober for 22 year's. Proud of you Mr. Moxly, one day at a time.
No John moxly no aew
Good shape, healthy, strong and still full of wrath, this is Mox! True, only Mox! Welcome back lunatic!
I'm very happy ..john moxly is back

Jon moxley ❤
*I uSed to hate promoS while watching Pro WreStling but Jon Moxley/Dean AmbroSe waS the reaSon I Started loving promoS and now I love promoS more than wreStling matcheS...Love You MOX...*
I'm so excited to see Mox run a muck
AEW feels so much more refreshing now that Jon is back.  It'll only get better from now!
Would have preferred a Darkside of the Ring on Jon Moxley more than this promo 🙄
And they say Seth and Roman have better promos now because of their little character change, LOL😂
he got thinner.
He looks thinner, feels like dean ambrose debut
i’m not crying you are 😭
You can tell AEW appreciates Jon as the crowd is quiet while cutting a promo
“These days all I drink is blood” legendary promo
What did that fan say
Business has finally picked back up!
I never related to a promo on a personal level in my life since watching some of the promos Eddie Guerrero did. So happy Moxley is doing better and that he is back.
Welcome back!! The year of Moxley..
Welcome back Mox! Wishing you all the best!
So what happened to the ""Dean Ambrose Returning at the Rumble"
Mox looks in great shape along with being healthy, sooooo happy he is back.
He looks great
Jon moxley is wearing Dean Ambrose's attire.
What was the heckler yelling?
Jim Ross said " well he ain't changed much" 🤣🤣🤣 I loved that monent
Missed opportunity to end it with "Thank you for listening to my TED Talk."
He looked lean.
Can’t wait to see Moxley vs CM Punk that will be a brutal story segment
Honestly he got the dean look back
THE LUNATIC FRINGE
Get back to tha shield ☝️
This was a very powerful segment
Over acting shop🤣
The .Superstar
He,s become thin
He actually looks way healthier
What did the guy say that moxley told him to get out?
👍👌
What did that fan say in the beginning of the promo
I'm glad that 1 heckler got kicked out, should have kept his mouth shut...
Welcome back Mox can't wait for his death matches.
YES MOXLEY! THIS IS YOUR YEAR!
Modern day Austin
What a corny way to end the promo
good to see Dean ambrose again
Mox is back and looking fuckin healthy dude. So happy. So happy to see he beat that fuckin demon that is addiction, Welcome Back Jon, lets get that belt back man. I love hangman ive wanted him to win the belt forever but moxley is in my mind the true face and champion of AEW.
@6:48 would of been a perfect moment for Bray Wyatt to appear lol
Jon Moxley talking too much, no good
Welcome  moxley
Arsenal till I die🤣🤣
I'm so glad he's back, everyone needs a break or a reset and this Moxley looks like he's ready to fucking GO!
😎WILD THING! WELCOME BACK MOX ! 💯
Jon Moxley looking thinner and healthier 👍
I had a dark cloud over me but atleast I was happy even though i wasn't sober. Then I got sober and i was angry that the dark cloud wasn't following me anymore. I was sober but very snappy, frustrated, and unhappy. So i went out on a rainy, stormy night and looked for a cloud. Now I control myself, self rehabilitation without the "professionals" breathing down my throat.  I drink occasionally, accordingly and have self control of when to stop. I've been controlling this for 7 years now. Believe me, everyone who says they're now "sober", its a even harder fight than the initial one. You can't just stop cold Turkey,  controlling the demon is the key. Blessings to all.
I’m sorry but….wolverine jacket? Am I the only one?
THE RETURN OF UNSCRIPTED VIOLENCE!!!! 😃
And he said the f—— word
so there's no chance of dean ambrose surprise at royal rumble?
Moxley! Moxley! Moxley!
Him and black would be a good match.
Drinking blood!!!!   ☑☑☑☑
Did he lost some weight?
What did the heckler say?
One of the greatest promos of all time 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mox the realest. Idc what anyone says
MY BOI!!!
G.O.A.T
🧨🔥 so fuckin good
Dam, I felt something.
We'll come back jon moxly 😘
Never in my life I'd heard the F bomb on National TV in Pro wrestling 😂
😭😭🥺 I missed you Moxley Roman is getting boring
How pissed is gangrel going to be with his gimmick all stolen and shit
I feel Jon should be the first two time aew world champion
Haven't watched wrestling in a while can someone tell me what happened? What was the demon his facing?
Mox looking good glad he’s back
Moxley looks in great shape, cant wait to see him go on another run.
Dean  ambrose is back 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lol. I have seen alot of alcoholic patients. But they end up really hard life. Hope he doesn't relapse again
10 min silence for those who thinks Dean Ambrose will return at Royal Rumble
AEW promo game is second to none
Yesss jon moxley is back yesss
Mox looks healthy and it’s ALWAYS good to see Mox back! 👏🏼👏🏼
Dude what a promo! Amazing
He still comes threw the crowd like he did when he was with The Shield
Why He still use Wild Thing....
When I saw his lean body the first thing that came to my mind was Ambros asylum. Grow some hair till the eyes and some tucked in innerwear with jeans surely will bring some old memories back. 😀
As the daughter of a father who fought alcoholism, if I thought he read these messages, I would tell Jon that I am so very proud of him.  It takes a strong person to stand up to those demons.  I hope he continues to win those battles. GOD BLESS you Jon.
Awesome return, hope he takes back the belt from Cowboy. Cowboy is bland and boring, he got the belt and somehow lost the fight and fire. Mox just showed everyone how you ignite it!
That wasn’t Jon Moxley out there cutting a promo, that was Johnathan David Good giving one hell of a speech to everyone in that building. Promo of the year right there. The way Moxley controls the crowd is like nothing I’ve ever seen before! Welcome back Mox, long live unscripted violence
The best promo of this year till now >2022
Happy Jon moxley de best in aew  Der hat echt Kilo verloren
JON MOXLEY!💥💥💥
JJJEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAWWWWWWWWWWNNNN EEMMMEEEEEEEXLAAAYYYY
looks like he got slimmer but in a good way he looks better than ever welcome back to my favorite wrestler jon moxley💯
wow omg
What did the heckler say at 2:30 ?
Lunatic fringe king of violence 🔥🔥
He said "get that piece of trash out of that ring"
I love to see moxley back hes on of my favorites 💯
Incredible promo. Very heart felt. Glad he's back!!!
Can someone tell me what the guy said
He put that fan in his place like a lead singer of a metal band.
What that fan say?
Is it too early to give someone promo of the year?
Moxley spoke from the heart, hell of a promo.
I really wish they go back to his original entrance theme song. I like that 1 better.
AEW has questionable booking.  However the fact they give the boys a platform to be them honestly. It's the last best hope for the business to survive the next 20 years
Is Jon moxly in the royal rumble 2022😭😭
All I say is stick to your words and don't relapse
Number 30.
We need Dean vs punk long time rivilart
He became slim
It is so iconic that Mox dropped an f bomb in his first sentence on the new network. Absolute king.
But he is scersting he needs some more care
Shame on the idiot who got thrown out for being a complete jack*** and saying something like that.🙄🙄🤦🏾‍♂️
He looks like 2015 version of himself with short hair and beard
I don't run from demons, I just beat the shit out of them, that's a good promo
mox is the fucking man..  Welcome back
What did the fan yell at the start of his promo?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love ya Mox
Big up to the Arsenal fan in the audience..efl cup semi final second leg tonight Arsenal v Liverpool COME ON YOU GUNNERS
Awesome
!!!!!
WELCOME BACK MOX!!!
I wonder the heckler said. I can't make it out.
He looks skinnier then normal
"I don't fear demons, I just beat the shit out of them" is my new favorite wrestling quote
So so so happy my man love of life is back and already turning tables to his side amazing maoved it AEW trp going up mark my words haha love u mox always does, do and will. 🔥🥰😍❤
I love Jon moxley glad to see him back and I will forever love him I just wish we could get the shield back together one day
I loved that not one person was making a noise, when he was laying down the truth!  Talk about PROmo!!!
I did not realize how shitty he looked in the past. Wow, he looks so much better now.
CM Punk vs Jon Moxley feud needs to happen
He looks healthier. I love how he told someone to go f themselves. Good opening promo.
What did that guy say for Moxley to have him removed from the building?
I got chills from this promo!
see you at RR
I'm sitting in a treatment facility battling my own demons and this is just what I need to hear.
"Joooooooooooooooooooooooooohn Moooooooooooooooooooxley!!!" The "Purveyor of Violence" has returned and in that moment of his return ... the entire locker room knew that they were all on notice!!! 💯!!! 💪💪💪..
Welcome back moxley 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Arsenal till I die 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was one badass promo from Jon that line "nobody is perfect, if everyone was perfect then this world had been so boring" was the best, go & shine mox and Kick Ass.
I’ve been in recovery since August 2021. “I don’t run from demons I just beat the shit out of them” is going to be my new mantra.
What if he's the one to appear in the rumble?
My wife left me please help me
Amazing to see him back and better than ever! so inspiring that he was able to conquer his demons and give us  hope that we are not alone and that we do have the power to get through whatever hell comes our way and surpass it! Im excited to see what will Jon Moxley bring to the table this year🖤
DC looks packed to the rafters
MOX 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
So glad to see MOX ring again and welcome so much!!! He's looking amazing and want fight back💪👊
2:30 what did that guy say in audience?
I so needed to hear this promo. It connected with me deeply and it came at just the right time in my life. Crazy right.
welcomebackMOX😆
Was he in jail or stg? Haha
YEEEESSSS!!!!
This new and improved version reminds me of Jesse Pinkman
this is the most motivating thing i have listened this year. thank you so much Mox, you help a lot of us to know we are not alone and there are lot of us who go through hell everyday, but we ain't gonna give up. we'll kick the demons in their bollocks and spit on them when they're down. we don't pray the bad away, we fight it!
what the guy say i couldn’t hear
why was he gone? though he was on vacation yo
Still sexy as fu*k!
He looks slimmer
So glad moxley back from his cocaine addiction he doesn't need to go through that road anymore he better without it
WELCOME BACK MOX!! 👏👏👏
Should've returned to Rumble, won it & then main event Mania with the Shield Triple Threat. Instead, still chose to hang on in the Minor leagues 😅
Jon you look better then ever!!!
I have never been looking more forward to straightedge heel Punk. Hell, put Darby in that role.
lie he drunk water when he come in
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 legendary
Paradigm shift
What did the heckler say?
I love your  mammals  Jon moxley
I see mox stole hugh Jackman's jacket from X-Men lol
I'm glad vince plan for jon return back fire 😈😈😈 the great jon moxley is back in aew can't wait for jon to destroy punk
I hope he keeps this trajectory.  War Moxley
I think moxley losses his weight
Moxley 1\22 "I don' t run from demons..... I just beat the shit out of them"
Anyone can tell me what the heckler said?
That was ice cold
Damn he's in great shape.
Ultimate warrior and stone cold promo vibes.... dunno if that's good or bad but it's good to see someone healthy and happy.
King is beck
Sometimes I feel like making notes of what mox says...this guy is an inspiration
Welcome back Mox! Give em hell!
One helluva promo and welcome back!!!!
The shield!
Does whatever he wants huh? Royal Rumble foreshadowing?  He literally came out as Dean Ambrose with that leather jacket for his return
This promo sucked
This shit better be trending
That was awesome
I cried when watching it live and I cried rewatching it. My demons are called Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized anxiety disorder. I am ashamed of them. Caused many invisible scars and a few visible scars. It's a tough everyday battle. I have bad self esteem and bad self love problems. So Moxley's words touched me. Thanks Mox! Glad to see you back!
Welcome back !
Put the belt back on this man ‼️
Loved every second of it. Welcome back Mox
Mox looks refreshed.
I have no idea how he held it together enough to deliver a promo that powerful without breaking down. You could see he was super emotional and thankful to be where he is.
I like how he said haters gonna hate and they don't bother me then has a fan thrown out for hurting his feelings lol 😂
"I'm thirsty and these days all I drink is blood" that goes hard
The fact that the first ever wrestling match I ever saw was jon moxley( dean Ambrose at that time) vs brodie Lee ( luke harper at that time)  He became the most loved wrestler.  in 2014-2015.  Even started watching aew because of him, thank you mox you're the best ❤
Cmon man.. you can see Moxley's face and you can tell that he is a lot healthier
Boring
Moxley’s face is much slimmer as is his overall weight. He looks excellent!
the real champ is back!
Cant wait for Jim cornette's review on this segment
So happy for Mox, I felt his energy. Can’t wait to see the amount of beautiful, healthy chaos this man creates this year.
Sober John is a even more pissed  John.
What was the point in this?
WAY TO GO JON, You couldn't have used better words with everything you said.  WELCOME BACK, HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE A CLEAN JON MOXLEY!!!!  Been waitin for you to bring it! And Bring it you just did! VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU LOOKING HEALTHY! I can see how much better you are. AWESOME!!!!!! Matt - Toronto, Canada
"Nobody should be afraid to stand up in front of the whole world and bare it all. Everything that makes you the person you are, scars and all, and say hey this is me." that's really touching actually
I feel he was brought back to soon he has way more muscle before he left
THAT, is a promo.
perfectly said mox drinking blood !!!
What a lame comeback..blah blah wah wah
“I don’t run from demons I just beat the shit out of them” Welcome back to the Squared Circle Jon Moxley
He was brutally honest. He looks to be in great shape, if he can stay clean, he will be champ again.
Welcome back
He is looking fit
He's back! An amazing promo! He just showed that the fans still love and appreciation him when he had to go to rehab. He is looking better and ready to conquer professional wrestling. You got this Jon Moxley!
Show up in Royal Rumble and Challenge Head of the Table. Win the Universal title @ Wm at Bring it to Aew!
Rip to those who taught Jon moxely gonna return in royal rumble
This dude is drunk 😂 and making no sense he sounds like Joe Biden
YAAAAAAWN.... uh, oh, sorry, I nodded off in the middle somewhere. Did Moxley get to the part where he's an overrated mud show wrestler with a geek fandom of neckbeards that cheer for him? I don't want to see barbwire-rope matches, I don't want to see C-4 exploding ring matches, can this goof win a match with a simple headlock takeover like salt-of-the-Earth MJF? naaaaah he'll go back to use a cheese grader some jobbers balls or something boooooorrring
Yo .I felt this. Felt this in a place i thought was long dead. Thank you mox
The Xenogears sign at 1:39 wins XD
Incredibly inspirational and one of the BEST promos EVER. Can we just give him the title??  Mox is gonna be soooo over, Page doesn't stand a chance and Moxley/Danielson will be SO EPIC.
Hell of a promo!🔥🔥
When Mox speaks, people listen.
Dean Ambrose 👏👏
He seems wrecked
This whole thing was cringeworthy. First of all, no one is ever "free" from alcoholism. Hard for me to imagine anyone saying that who went to treatment. They actually teach you the opposite. That's why when you see people at meetings, even if they have a nice stretch of sobriety, they still identify themselves as an alcoholic. I'm glad he's doing well, but all I thought about during this was all the people who aren't millionaires on TV, who have nowhere near the resources this guy has to obtain help.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Welcome back
"I don't run from demons. I just beat the shit out of them." Mox I'm gonna say this. Even though you probably won't see it. I've been fighting demons my whole life. Hell I've had a demon working for my ass because the son of a bitch is afraid of me. And I will say this. You are one of the toughest people I know. Mox when the time comes I will need you. A war is coming and you will be with me on the front lines.
I'm hoping that people will watch this and realize you can overcome your demons and to reach out to get help!
he is truly free, ROYAL RUMBLE
God damn he lost a ton of weight. Good for him man.
Good promo by Jon Moxley he's going to tear it up this year
Don't let anyone ever tell you wrestling is fake ever again!!!
Looks like he lost weight
Moxley to royal rumble confirmed!!
Just an average wannabe being all loud, shouting - to show that he is someone. Pathetic Jon Moxley👎
jon moxley, one of the most overhyped wrestlers
Drunker moxly
The silence of the crowd throughout, listening intently - that is respect. Welcome back Mox
What channel did aew air on tonight,tnt on the east was showing bs hockey.
wanna be tough guy
Jon moxley got skinny
Phenomenal mic work.
still a drunk!!
More than a promo. These are heartfelt words from a man who went to war with his demons. And, won.
If he actually got that guy kicked out for heckling at a wrestling show? I’m calling bitch move on Jon
John Moxley is fantastic I love it it’s back this promo was golden
Gimme cm punk vs moxley
Anyone know what that heckler said?
Perfect speech ever, even the demon is scared
Excepting Moxley at Royal Rumble 😌
Roberts put his everything into that one.
this theme sucks
so poetic, so Bukowski
Welcome back to wrestling Dean Ambrose
Mox ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👊👊👊
Was not a wrestling promo. That man, bared his soul. Welcome back John Moxley. Been rocking w/ you since 2009 C.Z.W. Delaware.
Jon moxley always reminds me of TRIPLE H.
Is that a new tattoo?
I'm not a Moxley fan but he looks great. You can see he's shed some weight and doesn't look red faced and blown up anymore. It's more obvious seeing him here that he was having issues in his last few appearances.
I can’t find the words to write to show what this means to me. I’m glad you’re back Mox. You are the living embodiment of what the view from the other side looks like.
love this guy welcome back jon
I Was waiting for stone cold to come out stunner him and crack open some bears ontop of his wasteless body
The Arsenal fan in the back with all of his signs are amazing
That wasn’t censored on the tv. :)
Goosebumps Inspirational  Authentic I missed Moxley, so did Dynamite
Jon moxley💪💪💪
2:31 what was that guy yelling that Mox told 'em to shut up?
Looks better...
“ i dont run from demons i just beat the shit out of them “
AEW TOTALLY MISSED THE BALL TONIGHT!!  LIKE HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE SOMEONE INTERFERING HERE IS BEYOND ME!! Who EVER HAD IF CAME OUT WOULD HAVE GOT BOOED OUT THE BUILDING
Welcome back Champ 🤩
Can't believe how much younger Mox looks! Him now and him back in October is night and day.
I am happy too to see his come back and i wish he will take this opportunity to the next level with extra ordinary weapons for his damn finishing..
Who did Moxley tell security to get out  of there?
Welcome Back Daddy Moxley.
This may just be the best promo I ever heard it’s so relatable 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 welcome back mox
woww love you  moxley
Best NED Talk ever
Welcome back Jon! Looking good too almost recharged again
Recovering from addiction is a lifelong effort. Glad to see Mox has won these latest rounds. May he keep on fighting and keep on winning!
And with that Jon  I've had my last drink. Thank You Friend.
All it took for one person to call Moxley trash and his true insecure colors showed lol. Yelling “throw him the F*** out” at a fan who paid good money for his ticket and has every right to cheer or bash anyone he wants as long as he stays in his seat. Goes to show how sensitive this idiot truly is. Cursing on national tv? This dude is not a professional
Him and CM Punk need to do a program together giving his straight edge lifestyle and Mox beating his demon.
What did the guy shout? Get that trash out the ring?
Not sure what I expected going into this, but Greatest Wrestling Promo of All Time was a pleasant surprise.
CTE and a drunk. He will for sure have a long life lmao
The way he owned the asshole in the crowd "Hey go f**k yourself, get this guy outta here. Piece of S**t" 😂😂😂😂
Does anybody know what the guy screamed who got kicked out
Welcome back Dean
what did the guy in the crowd say?
Hell yes!!!!!
Welcome back Mox!
This guys a nutter I love it 😂👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
That was amazing
Man he's looking great
What did that guy say before Moxley called him a piece of shit and had him ejected?
AWESOME JON MOXLEY RETURN ON AEW DYNAMITE ON JANUARY 19, 2022 !!!
Jon Moxley is an example that it is possible to overcome alcoholism and become a better person.
Why did almost everyone in the crowd wear a face mask? They don't even work.
Nobody is gonna notice how hes wearing the same clothes when the shield debuted ?(,
He will forever be my favourite wrestler
Going to thrash reigns at Royal rumble he is
lol wtf did that "fan" say?
2:30 what was that guy saying?
What did they guy say to get kicked out?
This guy right here is the best professional wrestler in the world and it’s great to have him back. Glad Mox is healthy and happy
I love Mox is open about depression mental health talking about scars this way. All to easily has there been stigmas for people like myself who have depression or mental issues. Society makes us to be ashamed of who we are that that label is all we are. When no those scars we carry are yes a reminder of where we were to get there. A reminder of the pain felt. But they also heal, which takes time which takes effort to get better. They become a reminder of how far you've come to see them now. They aren't to be ashamed of, but instead proud of your work and effort. To proudly state yes this is a part of me but not all of me. This shaped who I am today, and that's ok.
Arsenal fan 💀in the crowd
"These days, all I drink is blood!" 💥
Dean theme song better then moxley
He looks years younger.
The woman rocking over Mox's top right shoulder at 6:07 is all of us
So he did like 90 days the thing about being an addict is staying sober not getting sober soo tht will be moxs biggest struggle 🤔 pointblank......
AEW needs a new and better ring announcer urgently. Justin Roberts is annoying af. For the rest, nice moment.
damn we got 3 or 4 A+ promos in less than 2 months.   First CM Punk' promos v MJF and now Moxley.
Jon Moxley vs Adam Page needs to happen asap
cringe
Much respect to him. My dad put my family through a lot because of his alcohol abuse. Mox putting him and his family first shows how much he cares.
*Hopefully he is fine and there is some "hope" that he return at royal rumble 😢*
He looks refreshed and even younger. Welcome back Mox!
i hope CM PUNK arrives here and tell him to be drug free 😂😂😂
<3
Welcome back champ 🏆
seems like after 2 months he is going to disappear again. you should know drugs are not good kid. Poor rennie 😆😆😆😆😆😆
dean ambrose is back and is back on track time for him to win the Aew championship again
Looking much healthier. I remember thinking how much he had aged last time i saw him. What a legend, all the best Mox !
Always  moxley
"Nobody, no mattter who you are, should be afraid to stand up in front of the whole world and bear it all!"  This quote really re-ignited my spirit. Welcome back, Jon Moxley!!
What did someone from the crowd yell at 2:30?
I dont like him. But gotta respect what he does and how he does it.
What did the fan say at the beginning?
Just want him to win every single match in aew this year and go on to fight Hangman
Shit, I'm a fully functional alcoholic, I don't miss work, support my family without problems ect.. have been for years and years. I do have thoughts of trying to make it to the other side though before it all catches up to me.
Hopefully after while he goes back for that iwgp us championship
Welcome Mox 😁
I think this is just me but he looks a lot more like 2014-2017 Dean Ambrose now. He's a lot leaner now.
oonita!!!! near the fight!
Such an amazing babyface promo. A guy in a vulnerable position who completely owns who he is in a way that's an inspirational message to everyone watching, anyone can relate being ashamed of their scars, and then of course turns the intensity up to a ten just to let everyone know he's still a badass who is out for blood.
See you in the rumble Dean
Camiseta Peruana en AEW !!!
What that guy say? 2:30
Lol wtf that guy say even Moxley kinda laughed
Dangggg you could hear a needle drop.
Great moment AEW and Jon Moxley
The music is not good
He looks 20 lbs lighter on the outside and 100lbs lighter on the inside. Good on him for working on himself.
He looks pounds better than he did before. His absence has done him the world of good.
2:30 One can only wonder what they did with that fan once they had to toss him out
Important are those scars we carry inside - Jonathan Good , 2022. Man was spitting out lines of poetry.  Man is Gold on mic look at crowd going mad when they see him but as soon as he starts to talk there is pin drop silence🤫 everyone wants to listen what's he gonna drop.
congrats on most boring come back most boring character most boring everything
Looks alot better than he did during that ladder match a few months back
Another gem of a promo
The silence on that crowd when he speaks is amazing.
He’s not on dope anymore???
🥱😴
msh tabe3e sho baye5
This was cringey.
Great to see Moxley back fired up. And beautiful they let Mox be Mox be real and bear it to the world. Sends a message, if our heroes like Moxley can see demons and fight them off and that be ok. Then so can we, we can fight our own demons bear it all to the world and say this is me. This is what made me today.
who wants to see moxley vs punk! ✋✋✋✋✋
MOX Plumbing company is back
Mox with the F bomb on live TV, GOD I missed this guy
It's good to see Jon moxley back I missed him so much he'll be aew champion again one day
what did that moron in the crowd yell???
I love how everyone was just silent, taking it in
This promo is heavily underrated. It’s clearly one of the most influential speeches of the century. No exaggeration
Who thinks Vinnie Mac would or wouldn't allow a truthful promo like this from his talent?
Nice plant in the crowd AEW
Man, he's so fucking good.
For the love of god give him his old music back
This is better than sleepy joe biden!!!! THAT SONG IS SO WONDERFUL WELCOME BACK WILD THING!!!!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏😃😃😃😃😃
Bro that I'm thirsty line followed by how he punctuated this entire promo gave me Goosebumps
Looooo
Meanwhile, Seth and Roman are coming face to face with each other at the royal rumble
the charisma just walking in though honestly no one has
He is a master promo
Moxley looks slimmer, but it’s f’n great to see him back and doing good
Moxley has Piper vibes.
I say Mox still got ways to go but he looks like he’s in the right direction. I know what he’s talking about cause one of my best friends is in that road to recovery and it’s not an easy one.  We got you Jon!!
We are missing the shield 😢
Did Moxley seriously want to kick a fan out for booing him?!? Imagine if John Cena asked for security to kick out fans whenever they chanted “John Cena sucks!”. You are entitled to cheer or boo whoever you like as long as you don’t say anything offensive. I hope the fan was allowed to stay.
🕺🕺🕺👍👍👍👏👏👏
Wow!!!
I'm big fan,,, my fav Moxley . ❤️
Looking good 😊
Ever seen a promo where the entire place is silent? I haven't! That's Mox right there. Welcome back.
The only thing that would’ve made this promo the GPOAT would be if Moxley tells the crowd to wear their mask  Also this video is gonna be the most watched. Why? Because it’s the most motivating video to help you end drinking trust me
*"...These days .. ALL I DRINK IS BLOOD!"* That line was very on point!! 🔥
Phenomenal promo
he is looking trim.
My all time favourite superstar
Bulking is suitable for mox💥
Got to see my sign for mox at 2:20 I was too excited to stand still at that moment ,  was a honor to be there for that welcom back again mox!
Welcome back to wrestling moxley  love from india
Yayy the drunk is back. I give him six months before he relapses
A true fucking hero
Dream match:Jon Moxley Vs Cm Punk🔥🔥
He needs a better entrance
Glad Mosley is well, but he looks small like from his shield debut
He looks so, so much better. Good to see Mox back!
I'M SO HAPPY HE'S BACK OMG HE LOOKS EVEN BETTER NOW. I'M SO PROUD OF HIM
What did thr heckler say to get himself kicked out?
He reminds me a mixture of the sandman and stone cold
Moxley mocne promo
Jon moxley vs the sandman
I get wild thing....but it has to go at some point soon
Happy he's back and healthy just keep at it man
Jon moxly is back good in shape 🔥🔥🔥
I've never clicked a video so fast
Moxley is back!!!! Still cutting promos like a badass. Can’t wait to see him back in the ring soon!!! 😊
Damn, it's good to see Mox back
Mox looks amazing. His energy feels right. Welcome back!
will he wrestle the less famous wannabe MIZ?
He is one of the reason why I watch AEW.
Damn Moxley came back in my hometown glad he's better this speech was fire.
Jon moxley  miss you
Dude. So happy he's back, so happy for him, cannot wait for his first feud. Would love to see him face off with CM Punk or Bryan Danielson.
This guy belongs to attitude era or even ecw material and glad his back👍👍
markscott☝😆🤗🤗🤗😆 so yeah I'm glad you're on Monsters back with all elite wrestling and I think he's a great I'm glad he's back I'm a supporter I hope he have I hope it gets back the way it was doing that part that's my like that so yeah I am see alone he has it up as a good weekend I will see him in the next video bye for now
Finally he's back hopefully he's doing better
Aww damn they need to promote this BETTER!!  Didn’t even know they was coming to Washington DC. smdh
Mox vs demon house of black
I'm happy moxly is coming
Welcome back Jon Moxley!!! We love you brother and we missed you.
MOX FOREVER 💜
What did that guy yell?
King is return to hia Jungle🥶🥵
That gave me chills. Mox is definitely my hero. Gives me a flash back to Eddie Guerrero's promo to Brock back in the day. Welcome Mox we missed you.
Can’t wait to see what he does!  Welcome back Moxley!!
His behavior looks like stone cold
I've been a fan of this dude ever since his name was Dean Ambrose. Through the hot dog stands, potted plants, and teaming with Elsworth, I knew a superstar was inside of that shallow goofball gimmick. He's hardcore right down into his bone marrow. A Brian Pillman of his time.
Po
Crowd wasn't being silent; you just couldn't hear them through their face diapers
Looks like the dean Ambrose dude
great promo by moxley....and he looked healthier too
Old dean ambrose....  Yep. Look is old
They need to get him working with Pillman Jr.
It would be so awesome when shows up at royal rumble
🙏🏾👏🏾 Welcome Back MOX!
Moxley! Moxley! Moxley! Moxley!
He is looking more Dean Ambrose 😂
If u fall, do u stay laying, do u wait for someone to pick you up? .. no .. u be like Jon moxley, and get up and keep going! 🙏❤️
Finallyyy jonn moxley is back after rampage grand slam 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Moxxx
Welcome back!!!!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Yay finally he's back Woop Woop
What did that dude in the crowd say in the beginning
The I don’t run from demons sounds like a good build up story if he ran in the rumble and eliminated Finn balor
JEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOXXXXXXXLEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Who was that guy yelling
Been watching wrestling for around 30 years now. Never have I watched a segment that brought such profound emotion to me. This man is an actual hero, and I hope to find the same courage that he has found. Much love, Mr. Moxley
He looks really good. Much leaner in the face and body. Healthier.
Moxley should be a rapper
Hayes P.S Stone Cold MIXING RAGING FIRE...BABY...
He is going to be a heel tweener
I was there in person with my dad who is a year and a half sober from alcohol and man this was surreal. This was the most powerful wrestling promo of all time, moxley is the fn man
Finally back Jon Moxley
2:30 what did the fan say?
Jon moxly ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@ 0:06
Dean
hands down my favorite wrestler ever
Yoooo I wanna build to Punk, Miro or Malakai.  Not immediately but parallel until they collide.
The TBS airing let that F-bomb fly uncensored!
Always love to see moxley!!    Love from india go ahead❤️❤️❤️❤️
Now look like Dean ambrose
Yes finally
0:12 i have missed hearing that welcome back moxley we’ve missed ya
Justin Roberts is becoming like how Tony Chimel was to Edge. Gets me everytime. 😂 he should be Jon's personal ring announcer even in GCW or something
Jon moxley vs Deman Finn Balor match
Man I had goosebumps throughout this promo. It’s a crime to call this a promo… this was downright a pep talk. I have been battling depression for 4 years now and this is one of the best I’ve felt in a while. Thanks Mox and thanks AEW… Thanks for making us falling in love with wrestling again.
That was from the heart. Love it.
What did that fan say? I couldn’t make it out
It was pretty hard to tell if he was gonna turn heel walking down to the ring but the dude can definitely pull off being a face and heel. Really good promo here!
Fool aew's dogs😂😂
Mox is a fucking beast
Miss u old Dean Ambrose 😟
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Should have picked a different song....
What did that guy say to get kicked out? It sounded like jim Cornett
I just.. yeah never fucking liked him  Go have a fuckin drink and chill out
Welcome back Jon!
🇳🇵💖
This guy tries to play a badass too hard. Anyway it's good that he's clean now
Jon Moxley is back so He will become the new Aew Champion by beating Adam page
Now that is a fkn promo. Also awesome to see more and more signs in the crowds again, really giving me that attitude era feel.
TALK YA SHIT MOX!!!!
Woah wtf Moxley looks younger!?
We need moxley in rumble
He is defeat his inner demon... Love u mox
What was that guy saying? Who was shut down by Jon
He looks healthy again so glad 😊
Glas he's back, looks like he lost a lot of weight tho
Ive been there...
I am so glad that he's back.
So glad that Jon’s back. Also glad that Jon’s mental health is much better.
Welcome back john moxley and exallant video
Triple H vibe.
Jesus fucking christ.
What did that guy said when Jon told them to get him out of there?
what did the fan yell out?
What did the the guy in the audience say in the beginning?
what did that guy say to mox?
Moxley VS Punk? honestly that’s an iconic matchup
Can’t believe i heard an F bomb! Live and uncensored! It was amazing! Lmao
Punk vs moxley needs to happen
Glad to see Mox back, as a recovering alcoholic of 36 years it can be done. I am with clear head and heart now. And if my 8 year old daughter passing away going to be 19 years tomorrow hasn’t turned me back to drinking, then nothing will. God Bless you Mox and take it 1 day at a time.
I like this!!!🔥🔥🔥
"nobody is perfect, if every body was perfect this world would be a boring place" - Jon moxley 💥💥
Damn, best Moxley promo yet. Raw emotion and honesty. 2022 is going to be Moxley year
2:31 that will be in a complation
JON MOXLEY IS 🅿️
The MOX is back to raise hell on the aew champion again 🤘🏼🤘🏼
Thursdays motivation
Always respect for this man I'm facing demons RN and this man is getting this stallion riled up to TKO the piss out of those inner demons.
What did the fan say?
He looks so healthy! This is awesome to see
Welcome Back Mox 💪
I wonder what that fan said?
I’m happy jon is back and I hope his demon doesn’t take him into rehub again
Man how you gonna pay for a ticket and scream that at a man who beat all his demons?
When he said "the demon was laughing at me saying "the nerve of you. You think you're good enough for great things in your life? You actually think you're going to make it?" That's what I'm going through now and unfortunately I'm agreeing with them. Why fight it anymore you know? Anyways that's just how I'm feeling nowadays.
Excited to see what MOX has in-store for all of us, but I do wanna see him face CM Punk
Guys please explain what is the character difference between Dean Ambrose and Jyon  Moxley
Man I got to say I've never liked Moxley, even when he was at the "other place" but after watching this..... still don't like him.
Next pay per view main event is Moxley vs Punk. Why not?  Sting and Darby cant have all the limelight, right?
I can't get over how he walked through the crowd, and just knocked a sign outta someone's hands. 🤣
Imagine paying for a ticket to a show and getting thrown out less than five minutes in because you decided to be that heckler.
I love how aew does not edit or cut any of the promos with the replays
Ambrose Asylum 🤡
Everyone was listening to him very carefully... there was complete silence when he was talking...
Man Jon Moxley would have been great in the Attitude Era. But you know what, I'm glad I grew up with Silly ass PG Dean Ambrose and rediscovered JON MOXLEY!!!!!!!!!
Welcome back moxley. Glad you got the help you needed and now you are back better than ever.  Take it one day at a time brother
If he had the steps app, he would 100% be getting his steps in per day's and burning some good calories! I was getting dizzy watching him going round and round 👀 barring that amazing and deep/ impact full
This promo had Dusty Rhodes "Hard times" vibes.
God this touches my soul thank you so much!!!!! I've been there sir!
Finallyyyy Jonnnnn Moxleyyyyy is here 🔥🔥🔥
Nobody is perfect alright, If everyone is perfect the world would be boring💯 😍gives me a glimpse of his SHIELD DEBUT DRESS✨just felt it❤Happy to see him back
What's the name of the theme song?
Still have no clue how people think he's a top level guy.   Stone Cold wanna be.
Im super excited to hear Jim Cornettes take on this. Can't wait to hear what he has to say about this segment
Lmaoo mox walked to the ring mad asf 😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
That ending was bad. I really hoped Mox would use his 1st theme and have a little brock lesnar type character, but this......this is a tad bit lower than the one he had when facing Preston Vance.
Welcome back Mox! We missed you!!
I'm so freaking happy u Back  u r in my prayers  Just one thing whip some ass  for me  2022 $tyle
Amazing. I'm approaching 30 days no liquor myself. It can be done guys, DO IT!!!!
Id still like for Mox to come out to Sweet Caroline
Oh now want to beep it, after posting the filthy unedited 1 everywhere else
I had to pour a drink before watching this
The Shield is all time best tag team ❤️❤️
"These days all I drink is blood"  Fking great line
I have that same jacket.
Use me as a like button for Jon telling that dumba** fan off before he even started his own promo. Absolute legend!!!
2:27 What did the dude that got kicked out say? (regardless he deserved it--welcome back Mox!)
Love You, Mox!!
He looks healthy
Mox/ please bring back your old theme man
So is he in the Royal Rumble or not?
Grateful to hear a proud message from one hell of a guy. Transcended wrestling and spoke to the soul. Inspired and really happy for Mox. I’ll be watching this back for years to come . Welcome Back Mox ✨💪🏾🖤
Jon Moxly has some of my favorite promos of all time. His pandemic promos where he talked to us and said we’re all in this together still hit home. This one is just another incredible promo by Jon Moxly where he talk to audience and reminds us we’re all humans
I just realized the potential if Jon Moxley and CM Punk face each other
They would've been banned if he said, "eat your veggies, vitamins and say your prayers" lol
The crowd ate this up and kept quiet as Moxley talked unlike that idiot fan in the beginning lol.  WELCOME BACK MOXLEY
What did that man in audience say to which moxley asked the security to get him the f Outta here?🤔
Such a good promo!
Incredible. Goosebumps. Instant classic. Inspirational.
go beat those not so elites!
MOX is AEW
Thank YOU, Moxley! You are living proof of what we can become if we choose to keep fighting instead of giving up. I can't wait to see you kick some more ass on TV, and hopefully one day in Canada! Welcome back!
Hope his first match is MJF
book it aew CM PUNK VS JON MOXLEY ITS TOTALLY CHAOS DAMN!!!
What did the guy in the crowd say ? Lol
Good to see you back Mr Moxley. Looking good.
He paradigm shifted his demons
so happy to see him as JR said lean and mean happy he beat the shit out of his demons
Go back to rehab you're nothing but a f****** drunk I bet you you're a bully at your own home getting your wife Renee Young
OMG, FANGEEKS REJOICE,  HE'S BACK...🤣🤣
Wait what did the fan said around 2:30 ?
Cannot wait to see his first match of 2022
Respect Mox Trust me When you have family who deal with these demons whether it's drugs or alcohol no matter what like u said NOBODY IS PERFECT 💯💯💯
Welcome back Mox!
' Glad to see my favorite wrestler back
He has lost his weight I think 🤔
Wow he look incredible looks 20 years younger welcome back mox and congrats on beating your demon
Does this mean he is not coming in rumble 🤣
He looks healthy. Glad he's back. Keep kicking those demons asses.
Man I love this guy.
খিনোইছে
He looks like 2018's Dean Ambrose
So good to have this man back and doing his thing go Moxley!!
2:35🤣🤣🤣🤣
My best friend is back yeah 😢😥
He looks like he went back to 2016 he was looking terrible with the puffed up face
RVD RVD RVD!!!
Anyone know what the random person did to piss him off lol 😆
That promo spoke to my soul. The way he handled that piece of shit heckler was superb. Jon Moxley, I'm so fucking happy to see you back in the ring.  Keep kicking ass!
He looks great best of luck bro
Jon Moxley look like 2018 Dean Ambrose 😉
Dean Ambrose 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mox looks great
dam you can see how much better this guy looks
Im glad The King of Violence(Jon Moxley) is STILL All Elite💛💛 And I think That Announcer is a fan of Moxley
Omg. They bought a new song. Smh lol
Knock knock jon moxley is here🔥🔥🔥
I thought he was gonna say John Cena 😂😂
oh look my favorite wrestler is back HELL YEAH
It takes talent to make a crowd loud, it takes a marvel to make them silent. We’ve all missed you Mox
yo homeboy looks skinny, dude lost weight
Just 🔥
😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Talk about crowd control. Cody had hecklers throughout his whole promo. Mox had one heckler, got him outta there, and kept it pushing. Glad he's back.
What was that guy thinking heckling Moxley?
Welcome back Dean Ambrose.
Side note.. I'm being sarcastic and SO glad to see he's pulling through this. What an raw and emotional promo!
Mox became aew motivation speaker lol
Yes MY N 1 SUPER STAR JOHN MOXLEY STILL THE CHAMP IS BACK SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM
Can someone please tell me what the guy said to get thrown out. My phone isn't the best and I don't know what he said.
I actually miss the first 30 mins of aew
Moxley vs Page Moxley vs Punk Moxley vs Bryan Just cant fucking wait
Bobby fish fight Jon moxley
I'm really proud of him, when he cut his first promo in AEW he was training then started to light up a cigarette and drink a bottle of idk maybe a beer, when I saw him in that condition I felt kinda concerned, I appreciated he wanted to look like a decent brawler coz aew is fresh and is all about ruthlessness but deep down I knew he was paying a costly price and that is his health mentally and physically which is the biggest necessity when you work in a sports field. I hope he didn't go on rehab because he was diagnosed with some chronic disorder or tumour though, I hope he did that intentionally before it is too late, and lastly the thing I'm most proud of is that he involved all this sh*t in the storyline on a try to become a role model for his fans and make them seek their well being as well.
Great promo MOX....!!!!!!🔥🔥 Waiting for MOX vs PUNK..
Mox Is fire🔥
Hope he’s on the DDP Yoga program
That's the way. Beat the shit out of them, and keep right on doing it.
That promo was lit Af.. "These days the only thing i drink is blood"
🥳😍🥳😍🥳
He could’ve said “Daddy’s home!” And did the mic drop and it would’ve had the same effect
I kinda needed this promo from Mox tonight.
Can anyone make out what that guy in the audience had shouted?
Welcome back moxley
Welcome back
Awesome❤❤ jon moxley love❤ from  India🇮🇳
I guess I wasn’t caught up. What were/are his demons?
I find it crazy that he is trying so hard to stay in character. Also, at 2:31, what was that guy saying?
Welcome back
*"I don't run from demons, I just beat the shit out of them!"*
Mox is back and coming for his Title no one gonna stand in his way till hes on top again were he belongs so hangman hang on to the gold aslong as you can Mox is a waiting to strike
We want match jon for AEW heavy weight championship
Welcome back moxley
Looks the exact same
Man he reminds me of jesse pinkman back from rehab.
Glad Jon is back!!! One of my favorites! God bless you all everyone! Jesus loves you! Repent and Believe in Him! He is the Only way to heaven!  John 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.   God bless you all! 🙏🏾💙
The king 👑 back 😎
was there live. it was 20 times louder than how it sounds in this clip. it was amazing
“AYE FAK THAT GUY! Get him outta here!” Iykyk
That promo will go down in history, how can you not be a fan of Mox?!!
So happy he is back home in AEW where he truly belongs, fits! time to go for the ride and raise hell and bash all demons to nothingness! lets go!
I've never seen a crowd so quiet listening to a promo!!! What a Legend, Lets Goooo Mox
LETS GO MOX!!!!!
Did anyone hear that guy say something about giving mox a drink before they tried to edit it for tv.... but they missed it
Demons come in all forms. I don't know you personally but MOX I'm glad you faced that demon. Kick ass and take names.
Yeeessss Yeeessss 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
It’s great to see him back! Still in shock that I saw him at the gym i go to in Cincinnati on Monday
What made him take a break?
He tried his best not to break character when he was walking in. Glad to see him healthy
Great to see Moxley back...hell of a promo...looking forward to his future matches...
Welcome back moxley ❤️♥️♥️ I love to see you
Welcome back Mox! You have been missed! Now go kick some ass!
I’m an alcoholic, this helps… a lot
glad hes back, but i fawking hate his current theme... i know its purely to get the crowd to sing along with it, but his original AEW theme was so much better and far more fitting of his character...
jon moxley back ❤️❤️
Throwing his watter bottle, kicking stuff... he looks drunk to me
Welcome back Jon.. We miss your brutality
Moxley putting the whole locker room on notice!!
You can either do it the Jeff Hardy way or the Jon Moxley way!
Roman reigns says wreck everyone and leave Jon moxley is the right human to do that
Looking great feeling great. Recovery is a long road and he might have to cut some things off(anything to do with death matches in small promotions)
this man gets me hyped whenever i see him no matter how bad im feeling
Walked through the Crowd to Wild Thing  What a epic entrance. 😎
Yes I'm back John moxly
That "shove it up your A line" sounds like a keeper! Hope he continues using that 🤘
The cheers of the crowd and the voices singing his theme song should become Jox Moxley's addiction from now on.
Mox really hated that bottle
God he looks like better of both version shield ambrose and moxely perfect size and healthy and handsome I wish he had his old hair now.
So happy seeing him back
Can’t Wait to see him start a program with Bryan Danielson soon. Ik it’s gonna happen
let's go
For a second I forgot I was watching AEW. I thought he was going with “Johhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn Cena”, lol.  Glad Mox is back!
"I don't run from demons. I just beat the shit out of them".   Words I will live by. My hero is back and better than ever 💪🙌
What did that guy yell??
Kenny vs jon moxley vs hangman page book it tony
Roman reigns will be impressed
Damn that was emotional!
Lot of respect for Mox. It takes balls for a man to admit his faults and fight his demons
He looks a lot smaller than he did before he left. Maybe it's just me
People going on how healthy he looks he was jacked before he isnt now prob because he has been away from the gym while in the program.  Relax people glad he is back but some comments lol
Anybody know what that guy yelled at Mox?
So happy jon moxley back🥰🥰🥰🥰
Jon moxley is so goated man his promos hit the heart
It is good to have him back he's beating his demons and he's ready to kick some serious ass trust me when he drinks blood he actually drinks it good to have you back John now go win a championship and bring it home to the whole crew
Bet that camera man was having a fit trying to follow him that whole time
Let’s get this to one million views
What was saying the guy who moxley kick out?
He lost a lot of weight
GG!
Jonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn moxley🙌
Glad to see Jon moxley back on AEW dynamite.
Whats scary is mox accomplished all he did the past year while dealing with alcoholism & God knows whatever else, imagine what he's going to do now that he's sober & unchained
Holy shit
Last time he squashed Wheeler Yuta turning heel in progress now he’s back as a babyface cringe
How asshole can you be going to this show and scream "get this drunk out of the ring" in a moment like this. You have to be right next to the word asshole in the dictionary as an example of the word. Welcome back Mox you look great we fucking missed you
TBH I know this sounds wrong, but it would have been the biggest flex to walk out with a beer in hand. For Moxley's character at least....
Jon looks way better than before. It's like he deaged 5 years
That promo was fire 🔥
Jon is back ...shield 💔😑😔
Wow what an absolute star.
Welcome back Mox!!!! (Promo got me teary eyed and gave me chills)
he looks like dean ambrose 2014-2015
😳Oh My Got Shocking Jon Moxley Is Back *Former AEW World Champion* *Moxley*
Royal rumble 🙄
These days all i drink is blood
Ready to see this GOAT put on some more classics
I'm all for fans having a good time but you gotta be a real pos to say that to a man after he's battled demons and addiction
Ive missed Mox
He looks so much better
Jon you look amazing!  Welcome back you were really missed❤️
And why is he looking like 2014 Dean?
eddie will be happy to see mox back
looks so healthy!!!
Hopefully he stays healthy and kicks the crap out of his health issues..
Best of luck
Pretty damn good speech Mox
The silence...amazing.
I'm happy he's ok and i hope in the future we can have Jon Moxley vs CM Punk (Heel).
Between GCW and AEW, he's got some work to put in.
Mox Is Back  I really Missed Him 🥺🥺🥺
you got this joh
Dont know why.. I'm being honest this whole promo is 1 whole motivational promo. Anyone agrees?
I BATTLED ALCOHOLISM FOR 5 YEARS THAT SHIZZ IS NO EASY ROAD TO TRAVEL FROM WELCOME BACK JON MOXLEY.
The real face of this place
Come to raw the shield team again
Dean Ambrose also back
HOORAY
John moxley
Been a while since I heard a crowd dead quite and listening for a 1 wrestle doing a promo.
Moxley is the man
The Boss of AEW is back!
Watching this now in California. They edited the part where he told off the fan. Thanks for uploading this so we can see what he said lol
It looks like my guys nose was just bleeding before he came out.
Dean Ambrose is back
Wrestling fans are so brain dead they believe in anything that fake junkie is saying
Mox looks good
His body went back to his The Shield Era.
So happy he beaten his demons I got my own demons am fighting been a year and it’s still here
My favorite AEW super star John moxley  Love from Nepal
I am rooting for the return of Jon Moxley to become 2nd time AEW World Champion down the road.
I don't know why people go crazy for this guy. I mever liked him. Kenny Omega is the best. Jon is pure hype
This is the best promo Jon Moxley has cut since the one with him and Eddie Kingston, I’m so happy to see him healthy and back doing what he loves 🙏🏻❤️
Welcome back JON MOXLEY
What did the fan say?
What in the world is he talking about?  Nobody was negative about his rehab .  Everyone was supported of him.  Where does he get off acting like people wrote him off?  Total BS Jon!
THAT is as real as it gets.
Moxley fight cm punk we will see how is the better working horse aew
Ok so 1. He needs a new entrance song 2. Promo was okay. 3. Jesus give this man an Adderall please, the walk was douche chilling. 4. He looks phenomenal. 5. I'm glad he's better.
Everyone in that building was silent and just to hear the man speak. Welcome back, Mox.
He looks really good. This wasn't just a promo, this was his testimony
Mox makes me proud to say, I'm a wrestling fan again!! Release the Lunatic
Hell of a fucking promo man. Best promo since the Eddie Guerrero addiction promo
This sounds unhinged.
Welcome back Ambrose !
God bless Jon Moxley!
He is a great wrestler glad he is back..hope he clears the house
👍 moxley
‼️BEST‼️
I love you mox
I would've thought everyone knew to not to try to talk over jon moxley... I guess not
Come in Royal Rumble
Did Jon’s F bomb make it to live tv?
Love ya mox
Lean, mean and clean!
So glad Mox is back and healthy and I hope he stays that way keep fighting Mox!!!
It's so funny that this guy called Moxley garbage.  Moxley recognized he had an internal problem he needed to resolve, confronted it and took care of it.  This dude in the crowd on the other hand clearly has some problem, but rather than take it on, decided to take it in, and let it become part of him, and took it out on the world instead.  Mox had the balls. This guy didn't.  Get that trash out of the stands.
My boy’s back my hero from when I was in middle school is back I am so happy for him go kick some ass for all of us Moxley welcome back my hero.
Me being from Cincinnati all I gotta say is welcome back mox everyone has missed you and  your hometown sure missed you
Jon looks a lot healthy ✌️
face of aew mox
😂 Jr "Well he aint changed much."
I hope he's healthy mentally but physically he doesn't look so good.
Mox radiates attitude era energy. Glad to have him back.
Jon looks very different kinda, He seems cooler in the new look with a shave beard. Brings back two the 2019 look when jon was dean ambrose O>O
Was the F bomb censored on tv?
The dead silence gives me goosebumps!  Good on you Mox!!!
Mox is the truth and his words are too!!
Now this is real!
Welcome back Moxley!
I'm glad for Jon Moxley. He's back in black beating his demons welcome back Moxley
Well, now I have wood
Felt Like I Was In A  Church Service When They Got Quiet And It Really Sounded Like He Was Preaching 🙏🏾 I Say Amen God Bless This Man And Everyone More Importantly My AEW Family I Love Yall 💚🤙🏾
Man I missed him so much and the "Joooooooonnnnn Moxley!" Intro haha
2:30 🤣
NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY FOR A RETURN!!!!!!
6:46 try roman reigns hehehe but welcome back mox!
HOLY FUCKIN INTENSITY
One of the best Promos of all time!
Love seeing all the signs
Look it's stone cold wanna be . Except he can't hold his liquor
That talk right there hits the spot cause most of us have demons.  Mine was heroin and got in my rear view for about 5yrs now. That cloud he talks about shows up sometimes and testing me and so far have been able to kick his ass but know war will still wage.
HIT ME RIGHT IN THE HEART ❤️😭
"Jeeeeeeooooohhhhn Moooooxleeeyyyy!"  Dammit, Justin Roberts. Still can't get it right.
LEAVING THIS COMMENT TO SUPPORT MOX 🔥
Idk why but Moxley feels like the main character of Aew
2:26 that guy tho was so disrespectful 😂
He looks very slimmed down, lunatic fringe days. Glad hes healthy
He looks like dean ambrose from Shield in 2012
Jon kicking out a guy in the crowd was worth watching live!!
The puffy face is gone.  You can tell he kicked the alcohol.  Glad he fought his demons and won.  Welcome back!
Oh good, lucky break Nick Gage is back....
His first words were go f***k yourself 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LADIES & GENTLEMAN: MOX IS BACK!!
He’s gonna be at the rumble
The demon Mox talked about = Vince
Wow! Love Jon MOXLEY
dean ambrose baby face is that you
Crowd went dead silent respect 💯
My favourite of all time is back 💪😎 so much to learn from him . I'm coming to learn everything from you mox.🙏
i love jon please let him know
Damn 😂😂😂
Bro get fuckin Excalibur out of there. All due respect man it just puts a corny ass vibe on everything. I'm trying to take it seriously then he just chimes in sounding like a fuckin cartoon.
Moxley finishing move should be a stone cold stunner..it really fits to him
What did the guy scream?
The most respected man in AEW right now
ARSENAL TILL I DIE
tbh its like promo class on tonight's show
Jon Moxly is Backk!!!!!!!
Welcome Back Moxley
I am THRILLED that what he said and how he said it.  Getting help is strength, not weakness.
He looks like in 2019  Great to see him back

Good to see Mox! Great to hear the dapper yapper introduce him!
2:30 man thats just 🤣
I hope he becomes World Champion again. He really deserves it and knows how to get a crowd going.
It's great to see him back healthy and better. "I don't run from demons, I beat the shit out of them!" I love that line. Welcome back Jon Moxley!
Aew wait for me......
This guy is hungry... This animal is about to be unleashed.
Hell yes missed mox
You man John Moxley well back.
6:15  our love for MOXLEY  ❤
All the homies love Jon Moxley!!!!!! Glad to see him look more healthy and more stronger, we’ve missed u Mox
Crowd was in the palm of his hand.
Those words from Jon were badass! This guy deserves the respect!!! Respect Mox!
Damn wow
haha  live version was much better they didnt blank it out on live tv
I'm sorry to say this I love Jeff Hardy. But he should be learn a thing or two from mox. Mox kill his demon before the demon kills him
Thanks Mox, I've stopped and had relapsed, So good luck, you worked hard to be there.
Imagine one day Justin Roberts screams *Jaaaaaaaaaaan......Cennaa..oops....Maaaaaxleeey*
Welcome back to AEW Jon Moxley 🤩🤩🤩🤩
What a promo….unscripted, passionate and honest.
His lost weight. 💪
Real Comeback His Emotional Speech
Welcome back Mox!
How can you call someone a drunk piece of crap when they went to get back on their feet? That sh*t is very pathetic. Smdh. F* those people who cannot stand for you when you are at your highest after being at your lowest, just because of spite.
Ugh boring …  Aew has way too much talent to waste on this ..!!! Beating demons and all is fine ; that was boring.
beautiful!!!
As somebody who suffers incredibly bad with my own personal demons. I couldn't be any more fucking proud of Jon Moxley! ❤
Lmaooo they act like Sting hasn't been wrestling for how many months now who cares he never wrestled on tnt in 25 years that means nothing stop saying it lol
2:29 "get a garbage truck and get that trash out the ring"  I'm dying
“Demons” Finn Balor confirmed to AEW
Wild Thing! The Bad Seed Is Back! IT'S WILD THING! AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
The guy yelling from the crowd... That dude needs a slap and a hug.
That's a man who's got the world off of his shoulders.  Welcome back, Mox. Kill 'em All.
Why all these idiots wearing mask i went to aew indy show few months ago nobody was wearing a mask
Moxley owned that heckler!!!! welcome back sir 🔥🔥🔥
Hell yeah! Welcome back Wild thing

Lmao I like how the F word was censored but not the S word at 2:30
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Everyone should see this speech.  This wasn't a wrestling promo.  It was a guy who has gone through a personal hell speaking from the heart, trying to motivate everyone.  It was amazing.
I was in tears and with goosebumps.. welcome back mox
Forgot how good his promos are
Can anyone tell what that random fan was screaming in the crowd?
Jon Moxley
AnYone catch what that dude said to him in the beginning
Why Dean Ambrose is Hyper Always 🤔
Mox looks healthy and his face is not puffed up. Now waiting for mega matches
Jon moxley is the Goat
He looks fantastic! He honestly looks like he's 10 yrs younger. Before he took time off he just looked so unhealthy. So glad he took time away to get himself right. Welcome back Mox!
glad you are back bro.
Moxley looking better than ever
el polo de la seleccion peruana en el regreso de moxley, épico
OMG!!! He is back for Real!!! I might watch wrestling again and stay forever!!
Can he face off against CM Punk already lol
He looks so much fitter
Shout-out to the Arsenal fan COYG ❤️
The AEW promos are fire :D
'Wild Thing' only fits the 1 and only, ATSUSHI ANITA
A sign with the number three on it: *exists* Jon Moxley: Peace was never an option.
Mox is one of the most beloved people in wrestling and well deserved
Mox has the strongest Vegeta Hairline I’ve ever seen 😂
Welcome back!!
W
Welcome back  lean mean violance machine moxley
Man, he’s fuckin’ unrecognizable, it’s crazy how much alcohol, let alone being addicted to it, can affect you physically
3:28 - 3:55  That's called mother fucking BARZ!!!! ladies and gentlemen.
I did not know Jon Moxley's theme was Wild Thing. Maybe he's a big Major League fan.
👏👏👏 looking GREAT Jon!
Royal rumble 2022 Jon moxley cancelled return shield reunion delayed
They should have made his return a surprise the pop would blow off the roof but as a moxley fan I am happy he is back and healthy.
Welcome back MoX ..Missed u
Welcome back
This was an epic promo and it wasn't even for a match.
Just a matter of time before he's to drunk to find the arena
What did that fan say?
WELCOME BACK MOX 🙏🏼❤
Man loved the guy speech is mind blowing
Long live Moxley babyyyyy!!!!!
2:30 "Get a garbage truck and get the trash out the ring" is what he said for anybody wondering.
Welcome back Mox!!!! Thanks for keeping it real. Start kicking some AEW ASS!!! ♥️♥️
John Moxly-Dean Ambrose-Eddy Gunther what ever he desides to call himself he's still  crazy.
John Moxly-Dean Ambrose-Eddy Gunther what ever he desides to call himself he's still an a#&hole.
Sorry but what a terrible promo man. Over acting Moxley strikes again with the cringe persona. 2.5/10
Happy he has returned and ha lost the weight, he looked unhealthy....he's always been great on the mic but his tough guy walk is beyond laughable
Welcome back jon moxley
You go Mox favorite Wrestler
That boy preaching out there. Probably his best promo yet…
I love mox
I really want to see a  Jon moxley vs CM punk match  one day  hopefully soon  that would be a great match
He has lost weight and looks a lot like he used to be in 2015  This is more like dean ambrose  But the first few words from moxley after he returned were go fu*k yourself 🤣🤣 That's what i would expect from him
Jon moxley will not returning in royal rumble 2022 confirmed!
Over act 🎬 🤪 jon
i also loved how he got a fan kicked out LOL
I had goosebumps watching that. Even better the second time around.
2:30 What did the hater said to moxley
Holy Shit brother <3
Gives me Stone Cold vibes with the entrances lol
Jon moxley back in everyone destroyed  aew superstar
Mox has a bloody nose,  Wtf happened?
Nice as this is, I really wish they got rid of that cringy Wild Thing cover for Mox's titantron music. Was never a fan of it.  That said, what a segment! Let's gooooo! SO glad Mox has recovered!
2:30  what he say?
I don’t watch a lot of wrestling now-a-days just the the highlights here and there but man did this promo hit home for me and what I’m going thought atm. This junk really got me motivated to kicked my own personal demons ass in 2022! Thank you Mox!
Why do neckbeards try to get themselves over at shows?
JJJJJJJJJJOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNN MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOXXXXXXLLLEEEEEEYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Third week on TBS and this man told a fan to go F*ck himself. Mox is simply built different.
Welcome Back Moxley
Jon your man glad see back now time kick some ass
The Marlon Brando of pro wrestling. Love Mox
he looks so healthy!
Why did the one commentator speak over the whole entrance? Wtf is that? Can we just have the pop in its glory
Welcome back Jon  Moxley remember that You ate a Warriors God bless you
He lose weight
Forever my fav wrestler. Such a magnetic yet chill dude.
Moxley Is Money in AEW Dude
The weak link of the Shield. So cringe.
Watch out AEW because this very much is the resurrection of Jon Moxly.
roman reigns  we
Glad to see him back and more glad he looks like he's doing good!
Dean Anbrose he's real name

My fevöritë wrestler JON MOX ....🤩🤩
Such a wrestler to handle his demons and returning to ring again. He got guts! Welcome back!
He lost me at im thirsty
What did that guy in the crowd say in the beginning of the promo?
The silence in that crowd besides that 1 idiot. Respect.
Jon is back and he is on a Pilgrimage of Unscripted Violence!
Jon moxley is gonna beat the shit outta Adam page
Jon moxley ❤ is back 😲wow
The best shape in his career.
Jon is a Free Agent, interesting...
He is back!!!
Thank you Jon ❣️
Really hoped that they could've used unscripted violence. But I'm glad he's ok
What did the guy say
"I dont run from demons. I just beat the shit out of them." Thank you Jon Moxley! 🙏❤
Bro looks like he got younger. Good for him.
Damn man.. when he started speaking - whole crowd was so silent and listening to him... That's Moxely... Means to us
This promo was genuine real and authentic
Moxley!!!
I ❤️ Moxley
Imagine if Mox came back clean shaven and hair slicked back…
MOX for the first 2 TIME AEW CHAMP!! !
BRING MORE SIGNS TO WRESTLING
The King is back
Moxley is on a whole new mindset.
HE'S THE BEST HE EVER LOOKED!! WE LOVE IT WELCOME BACKKKK!!!!
Welcome back Mox. It’s good to have you back in action. Kicking ass and taking names.
What a segment and what a great speech!I and lots of other people have had bad things happen and this made me feel like I wasn’t alone and much respect for stepping up and addressing it in the ring!middle finger up and ready with you bud
Now he look like dean Ambrose 🙂😌
Mox vs punk please
It's feels some diffrent nostalgia seeing him back ❤️
Welcome back sir. Good damn promo.
Yay
hm Ambrose seems to have changed quite a lot. Good for him
i love it 😍 jon moxley..the real gangster in aew,the real champion best in aew 👍
Off the booze and the gear💉💊🚫💪
I’m proud that he is open about his demons and concord them head on. Many wrestlers hide those demons and end up getting locked up
Welcome back moxley!!!
whatd that dude scream at moxley? i cant quite hear it.
Jon Moxley is slowly morphing back into Dean Ambrose 😂
Jon is back, looks great and healthy and he’s ready to take back the top stop
Welcome back moxley
B+ grade
misser mox he makes dynamite way better
I bet that guy wished he never opened his mouth, he missed a great show! 😂
nobody portrays fake tuff guy better than this guy,eddie kingston is more believable ,happy for his sobriety,but stop trying to be brian pillman or stone cold or even tazz
For all those wondering what the dude said at 2:30 "get a garbage truck and get that trash out the ring"
Welcome back
Boring. The guy who heckled him was more entertaining.
2:28 😂😂😂
Dead silence while Moxley was talking. I love how respectful the AEW crowds are with guys like Moxley or Punk.
Royal Rumble ?
This is what I like about AEW and Tony Khan . They let wrestlers take times off whenever they feel like they needed to even in the middle of a big push and when they comeback they are still  get what was promised to them .
I’m so glad he back
I love that man like a brother and I don't even know him
They beeped it better this time lol
John moxly ❤️
🔥
Mox is AEW love to see him back and stronger than ever
FINALLY MOX IS BACK love him ❤️  Crowd gave him big pop and then the silence when he starts to speak tell how carefully everyone hears him Hie literally defeated his demons not once but twice not just psychologicaly but mentally  and hell he looks fit Damn this moments are worth watching  🤩❤❤  We fight our demon everyday and conquer it and most importantly the scars we have give us strength and makes us stronger
This guy talks like Natalie from Yellow Jackets.
Can't wait for Mox vs Page, or Mox vs Punk
What did that guy scream
Mox has the crowd in the palm of his hand
There's nowhere to go but, up for Jon Moxley. Seems like him an Cm Punk are on similar paths.
Love you dean 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😀😀❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😘😘
Tony: Okay, great job Moxley but can you stop breaking every single mic?
Welcome back mox🥲
What did the dude in the crowd say to get kicked out?
2:27 who tf was that?😂 what a moment.
This man deserves to SOMEDAY win his title back as a conquering hero.  Jon Moxley is one of the best in the business, and by all accounts a great human being.  Title or no title, Mox is my champ.
The curtain girl really was on the wrong side he could have easily push the curtain closed instead of pulling it and exposing himself that was Indy af
Magic of magic mox
Perhaps it's just me but, JM is just as dangerous on the mike as he is in the ring. I truly feel pity for the first person he faces now that he has returned. Also, I'm sorry that it won't be MJF.
Ok Steve Austin 2.0
I'm so proud of you I've been your fan for years and years and years and for you to break down the fourth wall and be realistic with everyone I appreciate that I respect that. Welcome back!
What a introduction
“all i drink is blood” love the subtle nod to the addiction
moxley pilgrimage to haj be submit to almighty creator..
Jon moxley should go for hangman page
Good to see you again, Jon Moxley.  We miss you since you went to rehab and replaced by Miro in the tournament.😊🤗
" I don't run from demons. I just beat the spit out of them."  "Nowadays all I drink is blood." 2 best lines ever!
Glad to have u bk Jon moxley I'm number 1 fan would like to meet u
I’m so happy for Mox, happy he got help, happy he’s back to join this crazy roster. My only thing I was sad about was he didn’t come out to unscripted violence love that song it suits him more but wild thing is a great also. Once again happy you a back Mox.
Jon moxley vs hangman aew world title
Take those mask off dummy’s
Cena had the 5 moves of doom... mox has 5 moves of doom and gloom.   1. neck crank  2. Shoulder shrug 3. Bug eyed stare 4. Aggressive gum chewing 5. Edgy cussing on tv  Shtick is old and played out. Watered down Roddy Piper
He's the only reason i still watch aew!!
2:34 WOW🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He's actually lost quite a bit of weight it looks.
Favorite ❤️ moxley
It is mind blowing how was insanely QUIET the crowd is!!! I've never seen an attendance so attentive! Welcome back, Jon!
I honestly didn't know that I needed to hear that speech about the scars... Being a recovering self abuse addict (cutting/carving), I've always been ashamed of them.. But hearing Mox's talk was something I needed to desperately hear.
Amen
Moxley vs C.M. Punk would be LEGENDARY
Pac which time return.
Punk vs MOX, who's with me?
Great promo but terrible entrance music. Please go back to "Unscripted Violence".
Welcome Back 🎉 Former AEW World Champion Jon Moxley 👊
hold on the first thing he does is grab a drink and toss the bottole? dude wtf?
Moxley looks younger. He looks like his best version (2013). Shave your beard and bring back your sideburns!
Love u so much mox. I love aew because of moxly.
He doesn’t look bloated or red, so that’s great! Edit: what did that guy yell to Jon?
WELCOMEEEE BACKKK MOXX!!!!🤍🤍🤍🤍
welcome back MOX
Mox ❤️
Now he's in good shape.
Welcome back Jon 😊😎
Man the dream matches wit this guy.... incredible
2:35 it was uncensored on tbs it was so damn awesome 😎
Mehhhhh I liked him better drunk......
career defining promo right there
The most giving testimony i have ever heard as a fan. Thankyou Jon. Glad your back.
He's so clean...😁
Justin Roberts bothers me... So unnecessary... I think he misses JEEEEEEOOOOOHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN CEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNAAAAAAAAAA....!!! Smh...
Jon moxley 😘🥰😍
I like Jon moxley he is a great wrestler.🤩
Chris Jericho: GFY  Mox: Hold my blood.
Is that Mox have New tattoo on right hand???
My Man is back
I fucking NEEDED THIS
Jon looks leaner and meaner than ever. Ethan Page better be ready for the fight of his life on Rampage.
That speech hit home with me
Fire🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Moxley vs Punk? 🤔
All I'm going to say is damn it's good to see Jon Moxley back in AEW.
He really slimmed down. He's really laid back on the alcohol.
He look alot leaner and healthier. He definitely needed that 3 months break.
Inspirational.
He looks so diff off coke. Hope he stays off it
It's great to see Mox back in a ring but more importantly its great to see him looking healthy
"I don't run from demons. I just beat the shit out of them" Very well said
So i guess it is ok to just blurt out the f word on live tv now....
Congrats To him
Adrenocrome?
Welcome back my boy
It's damn good to see Mox again! He was sorely missed.
Mox looks great! I hope he knows how loved he is and how so many people are behind him and rooting for nothing but success in his health and life!
Jon thank u for conquering your demons and glad ur back
This is why you shouldnt script promos, so the Wrestlers can get the feeling out to us.
WELCOME  BACK  MOX!!! CONGRATS FOR HAVING THE BALLS TO SAY "I  NEED  HELP" & for getting it and for delivering SUCH A POWERFUL MESSAGE!!!👍👏👏👏 Stay safe and God Bless!!!
Wellcome Back Jon Moxley !
Thousands of people...SILENT...hanging on EVERY WORD this man said...THIS IS WHY I LOVE AEW!!
Real promos brother Authentic, let’s make them feel real
Has lost a lot of weights... Looking good though,..
Man the theme song just doesn't suit him..
I'm very happy to see moxley and is well welcome back deathrider Jon moxley and keep on fighting those demons that we all have as humans really love and respect Jon moxley is the best
I’m proud of being me and Jon Moxley is speaking straight Faxts bc nobody is perfect I goaded that Jon Moxley is the best
That passion radiating thru the mic is immense! Welcome back Mox!!!!!!!!!
Can somebody tell me what that fan said at 2:30?
Welcome back Moxley! <3
Mox is back
“Well he didn’t change much” 😂 😂 😂. Welcome back Moxley. We missed you
Why did he leave
My favorite wrestler back
Welcome back king of violence. Looking better than ever and still never missed a beat.
When I tell you I needed to hear this message today more than I've needed it ever before.. I mean it.. So glad Mox is back, and so thankful for this message.. because he may have just saved the life of someone who's battled demons for years.
Props to Mox for staying in character because you know deep down this moment was super emotional for him
The power of jon Moxley we can see in audience Faces❤️
What was that fan saying before he got kicked out? I couldn't make it out
I really miss that old Dean song ❤️❤️
😈😈😈jooooooooooooooooooooooooon  moooooooooxely...
Me and My wife both woke up 10yrs ago and told each other enough was enough and walked away from addiction and grabbed ahold of the world we missed for so long and the sky is the limit... So CONGRATULATIONS MOXLEY!!! ALWAYS GET UP LOOKING UP!!!!
Hope that ass so called fan. Got kicked out.
“I woke up before I could answer that black cloud” 2 minutes later “I told that cloud to shove it up his ass”  😆😆😆😆
Anti hero iz back
What was the guy in the crowd screaming?
I was hoping to see again his emo hairstyle, but, eh, good to see him again.
Welcome Back Ambrose. 🤩
Welcome back, Mox! We're proud of you!
Thanks for that terrible f****** Shawn Spears versus CM Punk match aew
Dean Ambrose ❤❤
The absolute hush that falls over the crowd once he starts talking is amazing. You rarely hear a crowd that quiet for any wrestling promo  I hope he comes back stronger from this. I am interested in seeing who he feuds with first.  Does anyone actually know what that heckler said?
so... he's a vampire now? lol  good to have you back mox!
I’m not crying! You are!!!
🤜🏽  Welcome back moxley 🤛🏽
God Bless you Jon
He gives me so much courage I love him so much
Good to see mox back and healthy
He's more sharp, healthier, this was the Jon Moxley that carried the company on his back during the first few months of the pandemic. Glad to have you back Mox, can't wait to see you cause havoc. Someone over coming his demons always reminds me of the story of Eddie guerrero. He conquered his demons, the damage was already dealt but he was free, and now jon is too.
Good to see him 😆
Moxley is back baby❤️😘
Shit is about to hit the fan. And I can’t wait
The complete silence from the crowd as he spoke…wow respect
This gave me chills and goosebumps. I'm so glad that he's healthy and back where he belongs.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates— 🎈
What did the guy say
What was that guy shouting?
ohhhh, o homi tá de volta!!!!!!!!!!!
LOL @ that Arsenal sign but great to see Moxley back!
The Best
man it's great seeing Moxley back and he looks healthy too.
WELCOME BACK MOXLEY!!!  You're the fucking man by starting your promo off by letting a heckler have it and throwing him out!!!  Fucking awesome!!!
So happy for mox man
Yes yes yes moxley is back me and him are a tag team now and we are going to win as a team in 2022
He dropped the F-Bomb on live TV, and they just let him.
WELCOME BACK MOX!! And many congrats on kicking the shit out of another demon.
Let's fuckin go Mox
Good promo
Why does Jon Moxley remind me of Tom Hardy…
Who the demon mox talking bout? What next for this awesome wrestler
Not gonna lie. I was moved. This promo hit me hard. Goddamn, thank you Mox! Welcome back! Been having a bit of a hard time myself. But I'm not giving up. Also, come on guys, you let the F-Bomb slip on Live, should've let it slide here. That is Mox.  Definitely saving this promo for the next time I'm feeling like shit. I haven't had a promo connect to me like this since I first heard Dusty's legendary "Hard Times" promo. So, again, really fucking glad to see Mox back.
Jon your back
Aew doing shit right much respect to mox
Nothing can stop him....... 🔥🔥🔥🔥
He looks really healthy good for him!
Wow that crowd! Straight  up listened to every word  of the great one! The mox!. Welcome back .
He's back🔥
💜M🖤O💜X🖤L💜E🖤Y💜
I couldn't make out what the guy was saying around 2:31. Anybody know what he said?
welcome back respect
Gat damn
Looking healthy. Face was puffy before leaving
It's nice to see mox back, looking better, and being healthy!  It's also nice seeing that mox's attitude hasn't changed one bit with him cussing out a fan on live tv and following it with one of his best promos ever!
Why am I so happy
Great to have Mox back!  Could we get his old music back?
WELCOME BACK MOX
The audience has become paranoid hypochondriacs again
Absolute fucking badass. Welcome back Mox!
Slimmed down walking in like "I run the sh** " AEW's innovator of violence.
This all feels so forced… let’s swear just because we can.
Can't wait for Moxley vs Homicide for GCW title 🔥🔥
That was truly fantastic from top to bottom I love how he called that stupid idiot out at the beginning. Jon Moxley has conquered his demons & he is back better then ever.   I am actually glad that Tony Khan made Moxley had his welcome back moment with no interruptions just him by himself talking to us love it next week is where things get back to normal for him.
AEW was desperately missing MOX
Can someone please let me know what the fan said to piss him off? Thanks.
That’s the quietest I’ve heard a crowd just to listen to someone speak.  Major respect for Mox!
Number one dude
Does anyone know what the dude he kicked out said?
I'm glad that my mans Mox is back, he went savage mode during this promo
What did that fan say
Welcome Back Moxley Moxley moxley moxley moxley
I’m dam proud to know that MOX is from my home town of Cincinnati , Ohio . He grew up in the East end & I grew up in Price Hill , .
What a coward! He kicked a guy out for yelling at him! Oh no he said some naughty words at the almighty mox! Jon you are coward!
Man. That promo. I knew it would be a moment but I didn't think it would be like that.... My eyes starting watering the longer he spoke and when he dropped that last line about how all he drinks is blood. I stood up and applauded right in my living room. Mox has always been and always will be one of my favorites and as long as he's happy, healthy and doing what he loves. I'll be right there to root him on....unbelievable
HELL YEEAHHHH!! MY MAN MOXLEY IS BACK.....Violence is back on AEW, GIVE THIS MAN THE WORLD TITTLE ALREADY.
I’m thrilled to see Moxley back. I’m proud he took time to take care of himself. I can’t wait to see what he does next.
He lost the gut too.  He is cut.
Por favor todo latinoamérica lo pide a gritos cambian los narradores en español no saben traducir o lo hacen pésimo
A Wild MOX is Out, and he's out for Blood!!
Awesome 👏🏾
The man is free... And very thirsty for blood. Nothing but respect for this man. Welcome back, Jon.
Send back him to shield
Congrats to my man Mox. Can’t wait to see him back in the ring on Friday
Motivation🤞🏻🤍. Welcome back brotha.

2:27 "Boo! "Get this drunken piece of trash out the ring."
So happy he's back
Legend
What an immortal promo from Mox!!! It was a heartfelt one for damn sure! 2022 is the year of Free MOX!!!!
"All I need is one mic." - Jon Moxley
Just turn him into the stonecold of AEW.. crashing ring, driving trucks into the arena, just creating random mayhem just to rile up the crowd... Or else plz hire the script writer of Attitude Era.. He will do it for u
.what did that guy yell at jon

Welcome back moxley
So, fabulous to see Jon Moxley's return to AEW. And his unscripted attitude. All he needs is to be a Dynamite Champion again. A long with his fearless fighting, to be carried into 2022 as he starts to hunt for blood, in the new year.
This wasn’t a promo this was a sermon. Amazing.
Welcome back Mox. All love for everything you’ve been through.
I'm thinking about the new stone cold version, jon Moxley.   Moxley 3:16 was "Kiss my ass and stay out of my way" that's the bottom line was returned.
Clean himself up!!! Proud of u Mox!!!
Moxley returning should've been the Main Event.
Welcome back, just happy to see his face.
He does look leaner than last time he was on TV. Welcome back, Mox!
I thought Lunatic Fringe is back.
I love how loud the crowd was when Jon stepped out then how dead quiet it got when  he spoke. EVERYONE (except the heckler, but he doesn’t count)  listened and respected this man’s words. Incredible!
I love  din embros
Love this fucking guy
I'm so glad he's back.  I bet Justin Robert's enjoyed that one.
The hardcore legend!
What a fucking moment. So happy for Moxley overcoming his demons
Jon looks great

Love Kip n the background... But background player 4 how much longer? Under rated and over it!   But seriously glad they didn't cut that dude who was a POS. Jon is a master on the mic glad he's back!
From a guy that grew up in Dayton to a guy that grew up in Cincinnati, welcome back, Mox!

We Missed You Mox Welcome Back Death Rider
Say whatever you want about Mox as a wrestler, but demons or no demons, the man deserves his flowers for his mic work.  And it’s amazing how evident that becomes when dude is speaking from the heart like he did tonight
What'd the douche say at 2:30-2:33?
"I don't run from demons. I beat the sh!t out of them."   Brilliant.
Mox is over his hurdles & demons and DAMN it's good to see him back🤘
