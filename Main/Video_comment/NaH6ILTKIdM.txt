❤️❤️❤️For those of you who have good intentions who want to help my brother who is studying in grade 7 and a nephew who is in grade 2 students, both are hardworking even in difficult life, their choice is modular because we have no ability to buy a second hand phone for online class, they still need online to communicate with their teachers, I am not asking for it for my brother and nephew even if it is an old cp model and any brand they will be very satisfied for their study, Gob bless 🙏❤️❤️❤️ may you be blessed. Thank you From philippines🇵🇭

Holy shit! You were always right this whole time 🤭
Thank you for spending your valuable time just to make a video, This is really a wonderful video.
Still the damn notch😔😔😔 still 60hz  Not worth buying
Guys I don’t want flat edges on the iPhone curved is better in my opinion who agrees?

Bad design iPhone 6
i got the 11 pro max 256gb when it came out cause i loved the design and wanted to upgrade from my s8+ but the iphone 12 is just disappointing me. The design is just crap and there is as good as no upgrade but i will get the  series 6 watch tho.
👌
Its still late🤐
اين العرب انا لا ارهم😂😂
The housing is chunky in my opinion.
I still got my 4s and 5 so I don’t need this boring new iPhone .I have my new iPhone 11 Pro Max which I giving my wife and waiting fo something exciting my new ordered Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2.
Perhaps the reason for this delay was to complete the hardware shortage required for 120hz and start mass production? If apple does not come out with 120hz this year, it is really hard against its competitors.
Looks like my iPhone 11 pro
Didn’t know you were a G-Eazy fan 👌
Where go you get your wallpapers from?
Wow nice..
7:53  Transparent displays would be beneficial as windshields in cars.  It could turn track driving into a near video game experience with the highlighted racing line with acceleration and breaking points.
Just imagine the noise these apple tarts will make wen/if they finally lose the notch nd then for the next 5yrs they will work on under screen 📸 folding phones
It’s a big iPhone 4s 😂
Loving this wider video resolution!
Please give me AirPods Pro’s🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Whoever needs a phone I have an 8 plus works with T-Mobile & Metro
the only reason I am happy about the IPhone 12 coming out is that I will finally be able to buy the IPhone X 💀
I still dont get it what is airtag
what does the airtag do?
Exactly ! When is really gonna apple lunch the product ? I’m badly waiting it the product.         👁🩸👁
What is the difference between air tags and air pods studio
Honestly if I win the AirPods Pro giveaway tbh I probably won’t but I would be so happy cuz my birthday is on the 3
a
We have been watching our dear apple pro say minchiquo and bloomberg since a decade now
This video released on 15th sep But Youtube decided to notify on 21st sep
I am waiting for apple to release a new iPhone for 3 years I guess I have to wait 1 more year
My brain: iphone My heart: samsung  My wallet: nokia
Will the iPhone 12 get Touch ID in the power button like the iPad Air 4? Or an underscreen finger print sensor?
IPhone 12 pro may i know the finale release seat..?
Im going stick to my IPhone 11 Pro Max till theres some changes
Well....that was a underwhelming event. You too seem to be disappointed.
Nice video , thanks to Jpc_hacker on iG who has been helping me in recovering my locked phones and also blocked access 👌👌
Why the excitement? The Apple Watch 6 has blood/oxygen level calculation and I get that on my Huawei Honor Band 5 which costs 1/10th of the price. IPhone 12 looks like a really boring launch. It will have a faster processor and 5G (at long last) but no 120Hz screen and the same crap notch and style as before with a bigger price tag. Cupertino might be celebrating Trump's action to stop competirion from Huawei but there are lots of mid range offerings from Xiaomi, Oneplus, Oppo and Vivo that make Apple look like a very expensive bad deal. Maybe they will be next on the Trump list?
My advice to all the iPhone users/ fans is to buy new iPhone only after 10 years!  Just got my phone 10 and I’ll get next iPhone in 2030! See u in when iPhone 20 comes out!
nice
I remember the “leak” on iPhone 11 last year, and the final look is nothing like what’s “leaked”. N here we are watching the “leaks” for iPhone 12. LOL. Peace.
I want all iPhone 12  pro models to have triple camera setup and not a 4 camera setup,the triple camera setup looks clean,classy,timeless whereas the 4 camera layout just looks too much fussy  and out of place and just doesnt match the iPhone's body
That’s crazy got every single thing right
Please can I HAVE AIRPODS PRO I HAVE BEEN WANTING THEM PLEASE
That was a disappointment for not having 120hz but that battery decreases kills that 5g iPhone quickly smh my iPhone X just died and I don’t know if should get an iPhone XS or wait for that iPhone 12 pro
Bell Icon: 1 Me: :o Video FROM 5 DAYS AGO!!! Youtube XDDDD whhhyyyy lmfao
What does EAP stand for?
You spoke with god again???
The iPhone 12 is so ugly it looks like a super old version of the iPhone definitely won’t be getting it
I can't say the iPhone will have that sharp finish
Great G-eazy tee, loving it
When will ipad se and airpods se come!?!?!?
airtags will be very useful for couples tracking each other...
Apple is a joke😂😂
All these ‘slight’ changes isn’t gonna cut it for a price tag of 1400$
IPhone 12 pro May i know the Finale release deat..?
IPhone 12 pro May i know the Finale release deat..?
Transparent display: “unclear how this may be useful” TOTALLY AGREE
that's irritating I'm ganna wait another year it's worth an upgrade still with iPhone x not ganna buy an expensive flagship phone with less features than the competition, that's frustrating 😤
Hi sir I want iPhone 11 sir I'm poor person I can't buy the iPhone huhu

Im going to buy iPhone 12
When will be annonced iphone 12 ? In October???
Was looking forward for 120hz. I guess ill pass this year lol
Flat sides, rounded sides. They just going back and fourth at this rate. Keep it rounded easier to hold.
Say what you want but I honestly don’t think that the phone will be that boxy.
I think no need upgarde iphone 11 to 12 because this year iphone 12 have no invotion iphone totaly confuse what they do
I have been trying to unlock this  myself for a long time now, until I met *robert_wap** on Instagram who helped me bypass the iCloud activation lock

All thanks to jpc_hacker on Instagram he help me update my iOS in a chip rate and he is involved in all kind of Jobs
Are the AirTags coming in packs or just one? And what would be the price?
Another we’ll have to wait til next year for that
I always try to check the update on iphone although i dont have enought money to buy it.  But iphone helps me   Push my self to work hard and maybe someday after a long work hard i can save money and buy my self a brandnew iphone. Who always on the go rain or shine 😇
This phone looks the same as always look at LG’s wing i may give up my 11pro max and get that! It looks SICK
Wow wat a sweet hark from *cyber_4carck* on IG he is a good man believe him 💯 show
All thanks to *cyber_4carck* on IG he a good man he halp me hack in my I which I really appreciate
It blows my mind that they have massive falling sales numbers and yet they continue to be complacent, non-innovative, and release the same design again and again, get rid of the notch, high hz displays, or change it in some way! Changing any single one of those would’ve been acceptable, what the actual fuck!!!! They’re making it VERY hard to be loyal, might finally be going to android, its like they’re trying to go out of business. WHY!!!!
Awesome! I want the wallpaper at the 2:00 mark
Already the current designs of the iPhone are a complete disgusting, really designers can not do better? put all the cameras stacked? really? Without Jobs practically the designs went to the pipe and without him the company will only present mediocre models that only copy things from the other brands. Pitiful and pathetic.
Not happening till next year. YOU SAID THAT LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE
I just love apple products. I use a macbook pro an ipad pro but I just dont like the iphone. The only phone I buy is the galaxy note series.
😊☺
People will stick with their iPhones from years ago and the main new buys will be the new watch and upgraded AirPods
I mean, can someone give me a single reason why one should buy an iPhone at this point.  I mean apple is releasing an ancient device which might give some people trypophobia all the while pricing it more than a thousand  bucks. Man, i miss the older iPhone's
will they fix error 14 as well in october :'( (consider yourself lucky if you do not know what i'm talking about)
It’ll be so cool to have Touch ID on the iPhone again. Like the sensor can be on the power button.
That’s so damn trash that they can’t figure out 120 hz. It’s been on other phones for over a year now. Absolutely zero reason to buy this year’s phone.
Love from manjeshwar,,, Kerala 😘 💋
Ah, that sucks, I would only upgrade from my 11 pro max if it had 120 hz... but alas, another year to wait
I wish i could afford that😌
Can someone tell me what air tags do?
Why not Apple iPhone 11S (pro)?
They make phones too early we don’t need one every year ... maybe every 3 but they don’t give us enough time to get used to it
Why cant apple get rid of the ugly notch like Samsung?
This guy intro is full of click bait
Hello, your leaks are every time false
BMIC virus come from India 🇮🇳
Bycott china
The camera placement bugs me a lot.  I hope that that chasis is fake and they end up with the 4 corners black square crystal design we’ve seen. Otherwise I’ll have to wait another year to change my 8 plus. 😔
Can u get a new mic I feel like this is asmr
iPhone 12 5.4” has smaller notch because the biometric sensor is in power button, just like on iPad Air 4.
How much will be the MAh of iPhone 12 pros battery does anyone knows ?
Anyone know if 12 will have only face id or include finger...??
Love from Pakistan 💕
Welp...there goes your customers that have trypophobia....
Why would they remove curves it looks like a bigger iPhone 5 now
Watching this after the event and seeing all what was correctly predicted
I love these cases can anybody tell me how to get them or which brand the cases are from?
🔥
Many iPhones later...I still use a second hand iPhone 6splus 😂
When will this phone be released?
Not interesting lol
He is making videos on same topic since a year now. Just:i phone 12 leaks....and people are also wasting their time
Apple Still almost same design 😏 more than our company's designed full screen to body 93% with top up camera look awesome. I'm still no buy iPhone till apple make fully screen.
I still use Iphone 6 which I do not complain;)
It's basically iPhone 11 with a different name
Seriously Iphone will end up like Nokia in the past B’coz they late join the Game like 120Hz display ooohh come on its already 2 years around, periscope camera aaaww its already 2 years hang around come on apple
60hrz 😂😂😂
Trust me that renders showing boxy shape is not the iPhone 12 shape. It won't be that much sharp Square . It will be smooth boxy square design
This is the most boring iphone upgrade ever
Doctor *exists*  Apple - "𝙄'𝙢 𝙖𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙚𝙣𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙢𝙖𝙣'𝙨 𝙬𝙝𝙤𝙡𝙚 𝙘𝙖𝙧𝙚𝙚𝙧"
For the 1% of y'all who see this have a blessed day and never lose hope
Is it me or did Apple not even mention the iPhone 12
Refresh rate of ipad ??
I wish the sides were matte brushed aluminum. Shiny metal easily shows scratches 😔
Siri shortcut has a water eject option for iPhones already.
Hi How to get in to the sweepstake ??
Wow I love that iPhone 12 Mac pr
I love watching things i can't afford...
waiting for it.so excited to see this beast
iPhone 12 looks really thick.
Copied content ..
Stop wasting our time with leaks and just wait for the official release. Make videos about devices that umm currently exit! Damn!
Prosser wrong again
ican'tafford.
Tell thr truth.... How many of you Fanboys got excited because you saw blue as a color....... In 2020??? 🤦🏾‍♂️ 🤦🏾‍♂️ 🤦🏾‍♂️ 🤦🏾‍♂️
So like if I got my iPhone 11 with the upgrade thing in may I won’t be able to upgrade right? I got at&t
Men why does it have to be so bloody expensive 😪
how do you enter the giveaway
What’s the difference of the waves your talking about?
What’s the difference if the waves your talking about?
It’s the same shit as the 11
Lol last minute leaks and no iPhone launched
My iPhone XR has started recognizing my face with a mask on
Can anyone tell how to participate in the AirPods giveaway? I went on rebel.com and didn’t see anything regarding the air pods !
I hate Face ID 🥴👏
Apple just lost me because they are still not able to integrate 120Hz into their flagships, let alone 90Hz. Was actually thinking about switching from an Android device to an iPhone cause I love the modern design and wanted to try something new but they just let me down once more. I mean come on... it's been 3 years of 90-120Hz displays. OnePlus released a 900$ phone capable of 120Hz, 5G, pure power and a very good battery life this year, even their 400€ Nord has a 90Hz display and Apple can't even do that with their 1000$+ phone?! Just f**k battery life, let us choose whether or not to use 120Hz and drain more battery ffs.
Already preordered. I do buy new iphone every september, i hate apple and i only get that shit to get my ego satisfied. Otherwise i also do own a samsung phone, and i renew my samsung phones every 2-3 year. Its like apple gives you a device that is 2-3 years behind android tech. But the society included me buys that shit to show wealth... 🤷🏻‍♂️ weird century we are living in man 🤯
All thanks to *SUCCESSTOOLS77* on Instagram he got mine fixed perfectly with no delay he is the best when it comes to unlocking any device
Man Apple is really boring no 120HZ still having a notch still three cameras and NO TOUCH ID like really
I already have my iPhone 12 pro.    It is awesome.   I got connections.    😉
I have no idea what he’s talking about
Sawyer Sharbino is 🔥🔥 & he commented on Karina's Instagram
Until now have iPhone 7 😅😅
Need this right now as I just shattered my XS MAX😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The magnets are going to work like they do on the watch and maybe with car mounts? It would help customers find the sweet spot for wireless chargers and dare I say... Apple’s own wireless charger?
0:38 it’s really similar design principles than the iPhone 5, an aluminium chassis with glass glued on top of the back of it.
Boring as hell.  My Nord has under screen fingerprint reader and face unlock which works even with mask.  90Hz display and punch hole.  30W charger in the box.  I switched from XR and now I can't justify buying Apple any more
iPhone 12?! Holy shit I have an 8+ should I just give up on life?! It seems to still work fine for me though lmao I mean damn what am I missing?
7:45 ... please no ./.. NOO .. NOOO
What’s with the no more charger or the head phones ?
Still Rockin the IPhone 7 Plus...might get the twelve this year...maybe 🤔 any thoughts?
min chi kuo was right!
Soooo, notch is the same, still 60 hz... dude
Where are the Airtags?
What the hell is Millimeter wave? 🧐
Nice surprise news... love it's amazing
No 120 ref. should that be a deal breaker? How different is it with  60/
😂the camera area kinda gives me trypophobia
What;s “milimeter wave” capability?
90% of the leaks are true..  Who's here after the keynote   👇
No TouchID , I pass it this time ,,,waiting for Iphone 14 (if Apple is superstitious of number 13 :) ) hehehe  No TouchID , no new iphone for me!!
just get rid of the damn notch
boring 12 iphone
Anybody knowing this answer ,  I  had found one airpod pro  so I just wanted to know if I can buy a  any airpod pro  charging case and use  and if yes where can I find it not except for amazon   😊 thansk
Why not available  secure folder  Why not available  navigation bar to change menue styles as like samsung  Why not fast charging  Why the camera is not brightness and secure zoom
the wallpaper though I need it
Transparent phone... not gonna happen. Never going to be a true transparent phone even if they manage to do it. Its going to be some sort of display on which the back cameras(multiple) project the view to the screen making the illusion of transparency. Not a features we need at all.
face id with an alternate appearance fixes the mask issue!
I use to change every year my iPhone but tbh I just stuck with my X s Max and my Iwatch series 3 because they still work perfectly and there’s nothing new except the camera! Still has the ugly nodge, no 120hz and the Iwatch ain’t getting no new design? 🤦 🤷‍♂️ is apple even trying to compete with Android? I may not like Androids operating system but man o man are they ahead of apple! I just might give up on apple and just get me an android phone and try to get use to it! It can’t be that hard!
Why does every iPhone leak have the same design as a damn iPhone 4? New iPhone 15 leaks, the leaks still have the frame thickness as an iPhone 4
what is millimeter wavelengths?
JAY-Z is God in the book of Apocalypse / Revelation. I know this because I have the name “Jesus” on my thigh. Read Revelation 19:16 please.
Wow look they webt back heavy style
When they release iPhone 12
O my gosh! This is insane
Another year of 60Hz?!?! 😩😫😩😫
Why get so mad when there's no 120 bla bla refresh rate
It’s a better iPhone 5s
Here after the Apple Event & the leaks were so damn accurate!
People in 2019: Stay away from people who are negative. People in 2020: Stay awqy from people who are positive.
Who ever in the Apple company decide keeping the notch should be fired
They didn't release the 12
Apple is so beyond from other brands 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is the iPhone 12 worth upgrading from the iPhone Xs or wait another year?
Trypofobia
Samsung stop these ads otherwise i am not gonna buy m51🤦
Funny for you to assume that I can afford that 😝😹
Who else is tuning in to the event tomorrow 🙋🏻‍♂️
i really don't like your leak bullshit
I'm willing to believe the iPhone 12 Pro Max will be cost more than the 11 Pro Max, probably the most expensive iPhone ever. Although, I am so glad that the Apple returned to the squared off design rather than the rounded edges.
No 120hz display  I’m not gonna buying it
Haven’t watched an actual apple event since I discovered you a few years back. Thanks for saving me so many hours.
Iphone 4 with 2 more cameras 🥱
Alguna vez se han preguntado por que tenemos cortes de justicias,jueces,policias,milicia etc..? Esto es porque nos importa la justicia porque somos creados a la semejancia de un Dios justo.  Nosotros hemos pecado en su contra y roto sus leyes que tenemos en nuestras conciencias; cuando mentimos, adulteramos, robamos, somos orgullos, tenemos sexo antes del matrimonio, pornografia y muchas cosas mas, lo cual un Dios justo condenaria al igual que condenaria asesinato y violacion.  Dios es justo de condenarnos a todos pero en su amor y misericordia nos ofrece otro camino, el envio a su unico Hijo Jesus para que muriera en nuestro lugar por nuestras faltas y despues resucitara para justificarnos para todo aquel que se arrepienta de sus malos caminos y ponga su fe en Jesus sea salvo; Como un hombre que se tira de un avion y no confia en sus brazos para salvarse sino que confia en el paracaidas, asi nosotros debemos confiar en Jesus y no en nuestras buenas obras para ser salvo", porque delante de Dios nadie se va a poder justificar por su cuenta solo atravez de Jesus, por esto Jesus es el unico camino hacia Dios!
My b day on October 5😱 I'd like to win lol
Yessir 🔥
I could care less about gen 2, when are you going to make cases for android?
Is this even a good channel? Ppl only view for the give way... Nothing matched with your statement since last 6 months. Don't show your face within any solid evidence.
I was really hoping for that 120hz display 😔
Beautiful!
Thank god I bought the 11. It looks nearly the same
👍
Iphones suck
YES FLAT IPHONES ARE BACK
They need to make a pop socket with a battery inside of it that will charge your phone
10.9?!!
10.9?
5G is divided in two parts- Frequency Ranges under 6GHz (Regular cellular frequency )  Frequency Ranges higher than  6 GHz and above also called mili meter waves as wavelengths of these frequencies  are in mili meters  5G -Basically  means more antennas  transiting at very high frequencies  plus high concentration of towers  in small areas that  equates to that we all die early from radiation   Good luck everyone
Make slim cases
Nice
I already know i won’t be able to afford it lmao 😭
Thier is no new iPhone you dummy
If the iPhone 12 doesn’t come with USBC, I’m switching everything I own over to android. Ridiculous they haven’t update the phone to USBC yet.
Should I buy 11 or wait for 12 ?
🤡🤡🤡   lemme just leave this here
Sir i hope you have give i hope please !??? SIR FOR MY ONLINE CLASS
They need to come out with something new and innovative or they are going to fall behind in the market (prediction).
These phones are just getting crazy. I just got the 11 not to long ago, I swear you can buy this phone day one then 3months later iPhone 13 will be released soon. 😖
bye my poor ass is gonna go and sleep
To the 1.5% to the people who reads this comment  :   I really really hope that you and your loved ones will be safe...... I just want to say that I will never lose faith in humanity!    And also I really want to hit 200 subscribers!
Can't wait to buy my charger separately

Can't wait for the drop test 😁
Is it true that they have multi color in the  iPhone 12 max?
Nice 👍 nice sharing 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Apple: Here is the all new Iphone 12! ~~ Everything Apple Pro: Iphone 13 Leaks!
120hz was the reason i wanted to try an iphone.. well lets save money then
I have iPhone 11 pro max tax sex lax
What in the crusty crust “design” is this pigeon shit
Tim Cook has ruined apple. It is no longer the company with countless surprise innovations like with Steve Jobs. Now it is “let’s leak disappointment to our consumers and be 2 years behind every other phone”
Third final leak video Leaked videos: “this isn’t even my final form”
*Hey for IPhone solfwere issues that needs magic done on it,ZACCK_DANIELS on IG is the dude you what to talk to*
Air tags 6:07
My understanding is every time Apple releases a new phone they add one more lens
Whats a airtag?
why is he not verified anymore???
I’m just waiting for a real “upgrade” from my 8plus, can’t stand the notch on the top from the X,xs, 11 , etc.
Belarus president revealed World Bank and IMF offered him bribe of $940 million in exchange for imposing strict "COVID" measures, to crash the economy. He refused.

A boy asked a girl in a library, "Do you mind if I sit next to you?" The girl replied with a loud angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you !!

After a few minutes the girl walked calmly to the boy's table and said: I study psychology and I know what The man is thinking, I guess you felt embarrassed, huh? The boy replied loudly: $ 300 for one night That's too much! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the boy he whispered in her ear, "I study laws and I know how to make someone guilty ...     🤭 If you like the comment, please" write "on my channel ...

lol the back of that phone is just ugly
I just got an iPhone 8+ today and I thought I was up to date 😭
nostalgia from my iphone 4 came back.........
Are the phone rebel cases available in India?
50% of his content is iphone 12 leaks
Lol didn’t you say verified leaks? 😂 stop the cap
Saari same hi video hotti h
i think i’m gonna pass on this one. i have the 7 and i’m in major need of an upgrade, but idk which one to upgrade to. any suggestions?
Let’s hope iPhone doesn’t take this back to iPhone 4-5 🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️
Nice
Milking this leak news to the very last drop
This event felt so short, and I miss hearing people’s applause, laugh, and cheer in the background
If Apple doesn’t put 120hz in their PRO MODELS, it’s going to be their biggest crutch this year and put an end to a long running streak of having the latest and greatest technology that they worked so hard for. No matter what it’s gonna be “bUt iT dOeSn’T hAvE 120hz!!!”
So I gotta stay with my 6s for one more year!
We're in 2020 and Apple puts a Lidar sensor that's NOT useful nor needed for 90% of iPhone users but opts out of the 120hz? Planned obsolescence much?
Getting annoyed by the title, Final, Final, Final design of iPhone 12. It's the 3rd time.
Lmao imagine wasting money on the same phone every year
What if apple actually got good at hiding Leaks and they purposely misled us and then boom October hits and we have an iPhone?! One with 120 hertz refresh rate screen better resolution oled screen, more battery, fast charger included, 5g and sub 6 signal, iPhone 4 like frame and polished machining, 240 FPS at 4K. Faster face ID and better FaceTime experience selfie camera as good as they can be like rear cam hopefully. can go on and on. We will have to see in October and if it’s not up to par then 2021 should have a super cycle in design and function (new style iPhone). Might go from 2020 se to 11 pro if the 12 pro isn’t worth the extra money as the 11 pro should be discounted by this Christmas. Hope to find the 11 pro max around $700. We will have to be patient and see what unfolds!!
Patiently, waiting for the Iphone 12. Still using an Iphone 5, and can no longer use other apps thus the reason for an upgrade. 😂 I hope it's cheaper than the 11 when it comes out.
Apple is a scam . What a joke !!! As per usual the only thing that apple do well is rip people off by selling old tech!
OMG FINALLY!!! https://youtu.be/LP3zFtG-a1M
Rip
looks exactly the same as the previous generations. apple is really running low on ideas.  #TeamGalaxy
We are being played by leaks  is getting too old and boring no excitement anymore..
I NEVER WON A GIVEAWAY SO THIS ISZ MY CHANCE TO WIN SO THANKS SO MUCH IF I WIN THIS GIVEAWAY
Guess you were wrong, huh?
Im sorry but why does the iphone 12 look like the 11 but someone modded it
this is why i believe in android. apple is only popular for the trend and you're rich if you have it. they literally aren't even doing 120nk!! these phones will probably be $1,500-2,000😑
MAKE THIS GO VIRAL BEFORE THEY TAKE THIS DOWN . IM SPITTING FLAMES 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯 YOU READING THE COMMENTS  MIGHT AS WELL CLICK LOL  https://youtu.be/TlFeoMmr78A
Bro it’s literally almost the same as the 11
😂 and iphone got disappeared
So without the 120hz screen it sounds like we should wait for the 12 to come out then get the 11 pro 😂
អាចម៍
If this is assembled in China. Then it will ban in india soon. 😉
Watched Samsung ad just before this video 😁
When does it come out????
Love the “box” design, Like the iphone 5. Will be upgrading from my iphone 8 plus.

Made in china!! Still made in china.
Super Job Brother. #nadeemvlogs
I’m just gonna trade my phone in🤦‍♂️
Is there a point to switch to iPad Pro to the new iPad Air?
quiero queme regalen uno  siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Power beats pro 2?????
Anyone remember the iPhone having a 3.5” display
“Giveaway” no one ever wins.
I don’t trust the watch thing
no 120hz,i have to skip iphone 12
Reading the comments going "rofleofke Samsung has 120Hz" And it's like yeah, but at a lower resolution. You can see the blurriness from the downscaling if you look close enough. Apple ain't the type of company to implement a half-arsed solution like that, just saying. If that isn't a big deal to you then good for you.
Apple is running out of ideas
Never owned an Iphone. Don't like the price range.  At Amaz-on..please stay safe https://tinyurl.com/y4wp79x3
Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
It looks like the iPhone 4 blocky
who still wants to keep their old iphone without spending money on new ?comment  here
Funny how Samsung are releasing so much phones this year and last year but the iPhone comes out the whole world buys it
Sad how I last a year with every new phone and gave them up to upgrade - goodbye iPhone 11 it’s been interesting and Hello 12, btw watch me say this like next year lmao
Damn you got air Tight sources, I have 11 pro is there a big difference from 12 pro
Nope! no new Iphone
I feel like if apple took 1 year off they will have more phone ideas
I want a green iPhone
Apple event was the equivalent of adding a new color to the line up and calling it Series 6.
No 120hz... well I guess there is no light at the end of the 2020 tunnel...
How's that Samsung galaxy S20 one month later review coming???  Really lame that you never followed through
For real who is leaking this information from Apple because they are dead on most time
im getting a new phone around when this phone comes out but idk if i should get it it kinda looks stupid tbh i might just go with the 11 pro or a xs max or something (i’m using a xr right now(and i pay for my own shit i don’t use my parents money to buy this))
Anyone watching but you can't afford it 😂😑
So is the 4g available first then the 5g ?
How much are the 12 pro max selling for when it drops?
this man deserves his big 10 million subs
I still got the 7 plus lol
So that was a load of shiz
I'm laughing in Android
yeah just waiting for iphone 11 to get a lil cheaper.
I think they might skip the 12 and go to 13.
Guys help!! i just woke up now, are we in 2019 or 2020? I didn't see a bit change
Camera looks like spider eyes 😂
Dont think in canada any carriers built 5g mm wave, just 5g low band, so no point ordering the most expensive version
Like every single video is apple 12 pro “final leak,” but which video is the actual final???????????? 🤯
I have completely given up with trying to keep up with the newest phones from Apple
I have the iPhone XS Max (paid off). I have to decide to trade it in now for $340 and get a $200 off coupon for a iPhone 11 Pro Max or wait for the iPhone 12, and have my trade in value go down a little and not get the $200 coupon
More over priced garbage.
Hahaha my phone stops at iphone SE 1 stage
iPhone 12 gon look the same as this leak lol
What a shame Apple is keeping that ugly ass not another year I’ll stick with my 8 Plus another year plus no Touch ID again :/
dumb ass notch...no thanks.
So white 12 pro.
Remember a time when you could watch YouTube without ads
Ah yes 5 holes can't wait how next generation will improve its camera setup
Embarrassing.
what a shit year for the iphone it’s literally the same as the 11 except u get 5G i was only gonna buy if it had 120hz but i guess a 2 trillion dollar company can’t implement a 120hz screen
Get the pro max or wait for the 12 hmmm
They are copying Samsung ultrasonic tech They failed to copy Samsung refresh rate  😆
The NSA will be pleased with this. Privacy is no more, liberty is no more.
me with tryphobia 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
So is it worth getting it or not?
All kinds of new GSX Training........great...
so, is iphone12 gonna have finger print incorporated? or they have to still work on it? i didnt understand?
Not impressed with 📱 12 and watches.. so the Air tags 🏷 are just apple tiles?
Yawn.. 🥱
When the word 'leak' is used from an email that Apple sent.
Guess who’s getting this on a couple of mounts 😝😝 MEEEEEEEE
That's not it tho 🤦‍♂️ this company needed Steve Jobs so bad smh I can't believe they going with this look.....  iPhone 4 really...
Lucky for me I already got the iPhone 12
I’ll be the first to review it 📱
Me with my iPhone XR like : 👁👄👁
what’s would the airtag do?
Not enough to upgrade for me, I'll wait until the iphone13, seems like more upgrades on that one. The same bezel and touch ID is still not confirmed.... Ehhhh deal breakers for me
😬 nope
If it's not 120hz it's not worth buying.
https://youtu.be/sAzHZ7UlbL0
Another apple cash grab 😒🙄 it’s a no for me. The iPhone X still does everything
That’s a sweet looking shirt I loved that album
I upgrade every other year
I need to upgrade I am currently on iPhone 7 😔😔
I really appreciate ur work, quick question aren’t u tried to making same apple videos, they manipulate same thing again n again only fix few twerks. I had 4s then 7s max then 11max pro I think it will wait for next year as well.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr_mkDKcFrnFP99qNu7N_lg
It's A Prank
So they will reveal the iPhone 12 in October?
My Xs Max can read my face with a mask on still. Don’t know how that happened. It never used to do it before.
I bought an iPad Pro really just so I could play Xcloud. The irony is that I bought it the day Xbox announced that it wasn’t being released on iOS. I really don’t care about most of the other stuff. Now I just have a pretty looking Netflix machine that does everything my phone does but bigger and with a pen. So yeah I’m buying Xbox series S.
Going for note 20 ultra rip iPhone 12 pro max no 120 hz
fun fact: today is undertales 5th birthday :D
OH NOES MORE CONSUMERISM.. I GIVE U SHEKELS TECH COMPANIES.
They sale the same phone with a different number at the end of it every year
At the end i m still on 5s🙄
To the person that’s reading this:  You’re very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy during quarantine 🎵💨 My dream is to hit 6K I am struggling to get there 🥰💞...
They really makin a apple watch se
WOOWWW, ESTOY DESEANDO TENER EL NUEVO NOTCH FON 12....  WOOOWW
I think there should me a setting for if you are about to go under water that it just constantly uses the ejection speaker.
when the new iPhone has been leaked 83 times
whos going to get the iphone 12
Bruh it’s just the same phone
Crapple
i wanted to buy iPhone 12pro and i am w8ing fr Apple upcoming mobile  but now i am changing my mind because  i didn't like new design, this design similar to iPhone 11 series and  they don't give 120Hz refresh rate  so better to buy iPhone 11 pro or Note 20 Ultra
no 120 hz hhahhaha laffing on my s 20 ultra while I scroll down like lightning on the comments
How can everyone else make a 120hz screen work well? Steve Jobs would be ashamed...
Bruh why tf did they not announce the iPhone like no one wants a same “new” watch like bruh I have been let down by Apple
Oh it’s a good thing I got the 11 promax because I really love the midnight green color I hate that it’s not coming back this year I don’t like blue And I got tired of having a black phone and I don’t really like white or gold
Hey whatz up guies I got some boring ass apple products to show off. So sexay.
why do we need to go back to the 2013 boxy style. let's move on 🤦🏻‍♂️
https://youtu.be/mhBcdnnqPX0
This video in retrospect was very accurate
I Am watching your videos for the last 4 months . You are uploading just one thing, " Apple final design"  If you don't have stuff then don't  do bulshittsss
Did you have a video like a month ago with the same title? Final design leaks
Will it come with fingerprint scanner?
My thoughts and prayers are with you, Mr EverythingApplePro...
Definitely buying
Can’t wait to see highschool girls come in with their new iPhone 12 when they already had an 11.
I’m getting an IPhone 12 for my birthday.... hopefully it comes out....
When Apple going to upgrade theses $600 watches with cameras and facetime? To much technology out here they falling behind you can get a $25 watch that has these features from amazon.
Can I win
people already unboxing the actual iphone 12 in China    check Chinese Tiktok
I am seriously considering the iPhone 12 Pro Max as an upgrade from my 7+. What do you guys think?
I have iOS 14 beta and it’s the best
There is no iPhone 12 I’ve been watching these vids for like 3 months😂
Why did he had EAP? It doesn't make it clean anymore
“Wait for 2025 IPhones”
2:29 iPhone 13 ?

Very good bro
I can't wait anymore :) I hope this leak is fixed 100% also check the interesting game that I made here http://45.120.149.93/
When you find out the event is an iPad not a new iPhone 👁👄👁
Omg I new there was Ganna be a iPhone 12 haha Sydney
3.27 big cheese grater
I'm just here to see what second place looks like.... Team Samsung
Don't read my name
To the person that’s reading this:  You’re very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy in quarantine  My dream is to have 2k subscribers.I been struggling to get there!🙏🙏
When you're trending on YT before Apple themselves
even midrange phone  has 90hertz :D :)) goodluck rich boys ..
He was right
This year, like last year is a big skip from me! A big disappointment, too! I saw today Samsung’s latest models and I knew how overrated will be the new Apple models at launching event lol...They have nothing to makes us “whoaa”! See you next year (or maybe in a couple of years), Apple! You won’t have my financial support lol...😤👎🏻
I'm gonna grab it to film my new YouTube vids, should be cool!
😎
where's the new iPhone? today was the event.
apple needs to slow down the iphone 11 is what  a year old.......so what would be the point in getting a iphone 12, just to be a status symbol of look at me I got the new iphone? if it comes out this year
Is the apple event really happening tomorrow?
Kill the Source they don’t know dodo
Today was on iPad Air mostly?
iPhone event tomorrow?
Wtf isthis ??the same phone for 4 years , i never buy a iPhone for now , it’s a joke this Apple company ,just a little upgrade not something really new , shame ,scammers with documents
No dual screen no flip like Samsung or LG apple is starting to loose this smartphone race
Meh.. the samsung is still better
What if a new techcompany came with a new phone with these old ass specs and big ass notch, no one would pay the flagship price. It's ridiculous. And the excuses for not putting a 90 or 120hz screen on the phone, hilarious! Iphone 12 is just an iphone 11 in a iphone 4 frame.
I’m surprised that these leakers actually got the watch name SE and iPad model correct
I don’t care you like it, that camera setup sucks
I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF TOUCH ID COMING BACK !
I hate how chunky the12 looks :/
I think I might cop in 6 years
Apple 12 ware
Such milquetoast pathetic "innovation" from a $2T company...
I guess the links was right we did not get iPhones this event
So basically it's just an iphone 11?. With a square case?
iPhone was not released on today's event but when is it going to be released in October?
Every time I watch an Apple event, it makes me realise we were thinking too highly of Apple. The new event was too boring. Nothing to get excited for.
2030 I will gain enough money to buy a i phone 😍
NO IPHONE
Apple: “No iPhone this year guys”  You: 👁👄👁
well iphone 12 didnt happen
there is not iphone 12 :/
🤡
When the iphone 12 will come
So am I dumb for just recently ordering an iPad Air 3?
Haha so what do you want to say about your stupid apple biased speculations.  It seems like they have had you paid as a clerk
Hi Bro
I’m waiting to upgrade, is it best to wait till the iPhone 12 is announced so they can reduce the price on the 11 pro max or just go for pro max now
Besides the IPHONE this dude chats BS about every products he predicts about
No 120 HZ...All I needed to hear. Samsung here I come.
Who’s here after no iphone 12
There's no iPhone 12 this year guys!! Aff
Apple: "Look at us! We have a brand new watch, which can track your blood oxygen, and has new faces, and it can help you everywhere, and there's a new iPad, and another new iPad, and it has flat sides, and it has a pencil..." *1 hour later* "...and that brings us to the end. I'm so glad everyone will be able to use these revolutionary, new products." "..." "Oh yeah and by the way iOS 14 comes out tomorrow"
Than dude u have so many leaks! It’s already a fraud ,ur contacts are really bad.
apple, you never fail to amaze me
literally cant keep up with apple. they have so many people on a leash that buy their new phones every year.
Everyone: i cant wait to get the iphone 12 Apple: so heres the iphone 13 Everything apple pro: the iphone 20 leaks are here
Remember when the camera layout was a square, the notch was tiny, 120 hz was confirmed, mmwave was coming to all iPhones, the LIDAR sensor was on all the iPhones, the new phones had no ports, and they could wirelessly share power? Guess I'll have to wait for the iPhone 27...
So what’s the point on getting this years model???? They should just skip this year thn
iphone  12❤️❤️
No iphone on today's event 🙈😅😂
He basically got everything right.
Me: watches this* well if these are final leaks it should be released today Apple: doesn’t release the phone  Me: are you joking like Bruhhhh
Okay done
The only exciting flagship this Fall release season is, Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra,  Huawei Mate 40 Pro and Fold2
Welcome to a episode  What u cant afford  Iam happy with my android
Welcome to a episode  What u cant afford  Iam happy with my android
Well-well! After watching hour plus video. It looks like he covered most of it. Looks like nothing to hide in this world.
Did Apple not release a new iPhone today?! Because they never mentioned a new iPhone today
This aged very badly
Clown.  Where do you dream this stuff up
fi  you  Want   wear   i  life   i   in   guyana
Why does Apple event hold events? Everything Leaks and its almost all correct.
Touch id would be on power button as in new iPad air !
this is all false. Watch out for a second apple event by the end of the month
#freefornite
saying it wouldn't be called apple watch se didn’t age well
I just saw the event and the new band for the Apple Watch series 6 looks really cool
take my wallet
Iphone 12 next month
and nothing event over and no iphone
Is it gonna be also matt like 11 pro Or glass like X ?
They really didn’t say anything about iPhone 12 😐
Hi  i  love  you  ..   your the  best   you  are   the  best  to  me❤❤👍👍👍
No phone announcement 😼😼 The Apple Event is over 😼😼😼
Air pods
Iam a big fan of u filp from india
Iphone 12 will have a side mounted touch id.(sorry for the mistake)
The real innovation this year's keynote was the absence of the iPhone itself
Apple didnt launched iphone 12 ,a little disappointment flip
this is so sad. i was really hoping that apple would surprise-announce iphone 12 today :(
I spent 1h+ on watching the event no Iphone 12 bruhhhh the iphone 12 was the main reason why people was watching 😒😩
Thank you for sharing
You were right. No iPhone 12 today :(
Apple has really fallen off. Weak af
Wait where’s the flash on the phone? i couldn’t see it
who’s here after the event? I DONT WANNA WAIT UNTIL OCTOBER APPLE RELEASE IT NOWW
man I thought they gonna  release new iphones today
Here after apple event. Where’s iPhone 12 tho?
Where’s iPhone 12?
No iPhone 12 🤨
Who came back after Apple didnt announce the iphone 12
NO IPHONE 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
No iphone today

They didn’t talk about it :(
Danggggg they didn’t Announce the new IPhone 😢 whos here right after the live???

There was no iPhone 12 announcement at the apple event?
Lol didn’t mention about iPhone today’s event 🤣

Whose here after iPhone 12 was not released 😞
iPhone 12 wasn’t announced today
120 hertz display will happen
They only realised the iPads and Apple Watch
Time to delete this video man.!!
Wait until he realizes they never announced any new iPhones
no new iphone this year
Welp.. this video didn’t age well...
Damn how did you know did Apple tell you as you got it out fast
Me scrolling through these comments with 120hz 👁👄👁
Where is airtag i-
Soooo who’s here after the Apple event and disappointed af we didn’t get a new iPhone or Apple TV?
RIP
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈Non-Duality
A Wide Phone That Has Enough Room For Head phone jack But Still No
Wait when are the phone scheduled to release
I want the new iPad air
Can’t wait for AirTags all other trackers are garbage and can never find my keys.
Lol I have the iPhone 9 📱
Everythingapplepro the new usb killer v4 is out!
Looks awfully thick oh no
The iPhone 4 or 5 look was the best they had to get rid of it I guess so they could keep trying to make them slimmmer so if you have a 11 pro no point in upgrading till 13 I wish they would not have that matte look I like the shinny look I have a space grey wish it was like a pearl white but no white available in my area I sure could use a set of air pod pros to go with my iPad Pro and my 11 max pro good video but they showed more than you thought at the event
The Wario Apparition But Its Really Different https://youtu.be/4DEIicQwMBI
Underground music https://soundcloud.com/user-339061425/0-1?ref=clipboard
Its ugly with a notch still
Hey great video. Side note, so first they want your Face ID and now they need your fingerprints.  Haha, no thx.
Waiting for jeery to rip that i phone 12 pro max 😂😂😂😂
Dannyboy
❤️
so that was a fucking lie
Who is watch this video using android phone?
No 120hz, not worth buying. The screen in the Note 20 Ultra and OnePlus 8 Pro for example will be noticeably superior to iPhone 12s.
ugly
I bought one from ebay they claim it was new but it was actually Icloud locked. Couldn't believe myself. I was able to unlock it On 1G tho with d help of a man *The_icloud_don*
Regarding the last announcement of the transparent display. I do not care at all about wow factor.
its gonna be 3k and with 8 cameras im calling it before i watch
Apple: here's the iphone 2020! Everyone: What! What happened to the 12! Apple: Cash happened🤑🤑🤑
Waiting for airtag
WOW ! I’m gotta get Note 20 Ultra , disappointing apple ..
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW9qBF29FLA
rip verification sign
If the 12 pro max doesn't come with 120hz or at least 90hz I'm not buying it. It's ridiculous how every other mayor flagship has a higher refresh rate than 60hz except for Apple
So now people are going to buy a mixture of Iphone 11 and Iphone 5 ?
Watching this 15 mins before the event
hi my name sardor Big fan of you can I get AirPods pros please please I don’t have a money to buy it please can you give me the AirPod pros please I’m a big fan of you
This year is going to be trash
where did his verification go
Boring year of updates and still no update to the Apple TV.
so 11 pro with a circle
👍
Dude I can't even explain how happy I am that they're going back to the 5s brick design, I missed it so much
"Only one person that like this will become a *Millionaire* "
Hope to win airpods pro im your new subscriber 😇
Reppin the G-Eazy shirt!!!!!!!!
TF is a millimeter wave??
Bro how is this revolutionary over 11 pro with no 120 hz display? And just a little larger in size and battery back up? stop calling it revolutionary already.
If you are reading this comment:  💕BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000💫💫🌈💕✨
When is the event?
I can't believe this year goes that fast since the last I phone it's was like yesterday The time passed faaaaast
Gonna switch from my Huawei mate 20 pro to the iPhone 12 pro
The more I watch videos about phones the more frustrated I am. Like every phone maker misses one important thing that should go on a phone
Have you ever experienced joy or seen things that are beautiful. God is so good. His Love for you outweighs the stars in the sky. His eyes are always on you, loving you, wanting to help you. Jesus is the express image of our God. His love is sweet and gentle. He is here for you with open arms waiting for you to talk to Him. He wants you. He desires so badly to be with you. He is waiting for you... God Bless you.
Always great video, and i hope i win the giveaway hehe
When the structure supporting iPad Pro case coming?
whats an AIRTAG?
Wow still a notch? The notch was the thing I was hoping to go away because I hate it. Huge disappointment imo
Who liked the video likes and comments like
“Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire” “Good Luck” 🍀
air tags? they finally have NFC tags after 10 yrs of android doing it?
Done
Apple will go down as the most powerful brand in history. Even a video about LEAKS (not even the real product) is top 10 in trending.
Ugly camera layout
The event is 2hour long   Apple :hi guy this is the new Apple Watch and ipad air ok bye
A transparent screen would allow for cameras and other sensors to be under the display eliminating notches.
Let's hope that apple surprises everyone with a 'one more thing'
u now got the implications of naming ur YT channel.
Goodbye Apple...
trypophobia people are crying rn
R dey makin a series 6 nike watch????
"...this is the real deal" haha might want to reconsider having a good source on leaks tho. Lav ya still
Touch screen imac would be super cool
We’re literally being scammed every year 😑
See you after the event, it’ll be called the iPhone 11S
also wish iPhone SE plus would be a thing with the iPhone 8 Plus Camera setup and Face ID 😔.
Every year: it won’t be in this years iphone hopefully 20XX
It‘s a dystopian world the year 2022: There are only pro models of everything. You cannot buy an iPhone SE, you can only buy the iPhone SE PRO. The new iPhone is called the all new iPhone 14 PRO MAX ULTRA. It has a brand new, never before seen, revolutionary 60Hz display, face ID (with the same notch), an even smaller battery, but a processor that‘s faster then the Mac PRO ULTRA, tho it cannot run anything useful but Fortnite at 34628fps.
Too many ads! 😫
No 120hz....okay Apple keep staying behind your competitors 🤦‍♀️
For the love of God, PLEASE GET RID OF THE D@MN NOTCH!
Hey lovely people ..as we wait for iPhone 12 remember that Jesus Christ loves you and is coming back soon for us that believe in him make that choice today please we can't know when it is but we know it is sooner than ever😍😍😍😍 love you all
If they ain‘t got 120Hz I ain‘t payin‘ 1200$
The fact this guy uses Jon as a “source” is quite comical. Come on everything apple pro you’re better than that
The new phones look heavy to me...
I bet the iPhone 12 is coming out bec at work(target) they took the phones down and the iPads.
Built like a iphone 5 with more cameras
all of your videos are so fake you get nothing right about the phones
https://www.joylavita.com/
Ahh shit here we go again
A phone in 2020 without 120 hz lol thats a joke
What does the EAP mean in the channel name? No longer verified?
So because a youtuber tells you they won’t be announcing the iPhone 12 you believe them?😂 they’ve never hosted two seperatr events in the span of a few weeks makes no sense the 12 will be announced today it’s a 2 hour event cmon ppl🤦🏽‍♂️
bet it ain’t gonna look like that
Well, without 120hz, this phone is already dead for me...
Make iPad cases then I will buy your stuff beacuse I have a iPad mini
What does EAP stand for??
Hopefully this year apple puts fingerprint sensor on power button
why is the new iphone worse!? does anyone remember how much worse those edges felt in the hand when they had an iphone 5

Where can I get those wallpapers they are awesome!!?
They will announce iPhone 12 today
I was buying an iPhone 12 this year, but now that we know it won’t have a 120hrz display. I will scrap that shit and buy an oneplus 8 pro for half price instead. Sincerely from an iPhone customer since the iPhone 4.
The SIM card is on the opposite side. I’m upgrading!!!!
No high refresh rate display = no upgrade, my 11 pro max solved one of my biggest problems which was battery life. As much as I love their products it’s pathetic to see a phone $1000 range not have high refresh rate from a trillion dollar company while there are phones half that price that have already implemented 90hz displays on their phones.
Great info am so excited for what’s coming
60Hz is on iPhone still better than 120 on Android
cant believe this tosser has a dedicated apple channel. what a pillock! another talentless youtuber getting famous from product "leaks"
7:49 unclear how transparent displays would be useful... Dude you can hide the camera behind the display then
12 camera Gang
lectors responsories
I miss the Samsung videos
“Hey whats up guys ?! EAP here” never gets old 😂😍
Every year the same. Hyping unreliable sources that claim magic stuff up and at the end it‘s a slightly better cam and a slightly faster processor as every year. Wanna bet one day after the release the lies start again and we‘ll see a foldable 600 hz iphone with three week battery and an included toaster because a tweet said so.
Look man all I want is in screen Touch ID...
https://youtu.be/0uefq_feL-Q
Who here wants the iPhone 12
What about the iPhone se plus?
Now I wish I got the 11 Pro️ max but they have none left with high storage 🙄
Super video
Looks like I’m waiting for IPhone 13
Last year I wanted to wait till iPhone 12 but just bought 11 pro. I am glad that I didn't wait soo long for this because there is nothing what I wanted in the iPhone 12.
U don't know a thing , guys better follow Apple for real news and update, this boy keep posting random shiz
No 120hz then whats new a magnet thats only use full for wireless charging thats BAD
This is the final final final ... no uh uh no ... wait for it ... final design leak.
Screw this....why call it a PRO if it does not have 120HZ?? Total disappointment from Apple 🍎 again....
Guys , don’t trust these leakers . They predicted a new iMac being announced in WWDC and it didn’t happen. iPhone 12 will be announced today.
cases better then the pitaka?
I don't understand how Apple are able to bring 120 Refresh rate to the iPad and Adaptive Refresh to the Apple Watch and fail with the same technology on the iPhone, someone please explain that to me.
I really do wish that companies would stop using notches or putting the selfie camera on the screen these designs make it hard for people to watch videos because they're either focusing on a stupid notch or a stupid selfie camera blocking some of the video
Hi Filip. I think the iPhones will be showed today. Let’s see man!
idisappointed
Let's be honest. Nobody cares about the tablets and watches. Why wait until October for the phone release? Give me a break.
I hope they surprise us with the iphones 1st at the event today tbh. 📱📲
Apple is just not innovating anymore. Their biggest software feature this year was taking an Android centerpiece thats been on the platform for years and marketed it as the biggest change in iOS software since iOS 7. A 120 Hz display, one of the most basic new features on a new phone in 2020 isn't making the production cut, something that enhances the UI tenfold and is available on even low-end Android phones. And even the biggest change we were expecting for this year is just a solution to a problem Apple created for themselves and the entire industry: the notch and the shrinking of the notch. And they STILL aren't delivering on that. Holding onto my iPhone for stability, compatibility, and iMessage😐
Transparent screens would make aot of sense in AR glasses.
Long time
smart time to release a video
All flagships provide 120 Hz phones already. Finally when Apple will release iPhone with 120 Hz in 2021 they'd give an impression that they are the 1st at it.
Every year we get leaks of a new iPhone with something better , but every year we get disappointed yet again. If it wasn’t for iMessage and FaceTime, I’d been switched back to Android cause them new Samsung phones is looking really sexy right now 🤷🏼‍♂️
I think the transparent display is for under display cameras
I want the new phone this year
I’m curious how cheap the budget apple watch will be. I used to have a first gen apple watch and I really enjoyed not needing to pull out my phone while at work to look at notification but unfortunately I got the red apple logo so it is now dead.
Excitement level is on high
7:50 did he really say unclear how this may be useful.. 🤦‍♂️ I think it's pretty obvious 🤦‍♂️
Finally not wearing something from Adidas
Phones whit translucent displays has been made before, whit the Sony Ericsson Xperia Pureness. So it wouldn’t be that crazy of an idea to eventually make a smartphone whit a translucent display If possible.
This iPhone iteration is lame, strong pass on buying
Pay more, gain less.
Iphone 12 looks ugly to me no offence
it’s literally the same thing
ايفون 12 لو 5g يستهلك بطارية كثييير
ايفون 13 يكون أقوى 5g و بطارية ضخمة و هيرتز أعلى و كاميرا احسن
No high refresh rate display, super slow 18w wired charging (maybe 20w at most?), Even slower 7.5w wireless charging, no reverse wireless charging, same big notch (maybe slightly smaller but still huge), $700 for a tiny 5.4 inch model and $1300 to get a 6.7 inch model? This is really sad, Apple really is lacking in these big areas that are found on Android phones for half the price. Not to mention how far behind iOS is in features. Apple has iMessage and better social media video upload quality. That's it. And honestly who cares about iMessage.
60 HZ ???? WTF🤑🤑🤑
Can wait to upgrade my Xs max to the 12 pro max if that’s what it’s called iam pre ordering as soon as I can
Waiting for 2021. Literally nothing materially new from the iPhone 11 Pro and even 10s phones
Boring phone design when compared to the new Lg and Samsung elite models ..Even the new watches are still the same boring design ..no class leading design we used to get with Apple ..
Apple: "Here's iPhone 12" Everything ApplePro: "Here are iPhone 13 leaks"
I don't need 120Hz but I need at least 90! It seems I won't buy a new iPhone this year.
nobody needs 5g please tell apple
I feel like it they will announce it in September but it will come out October ish
I can't even afford to buy an iPhone 7 at it's latest price but still i clicked here.........
I have a feeling Apple is going to sell a lot of iPhone 12 models this year. People were hyped for the 3 year design refresh and 120 hz.
Why they shrink the iPhone 12 for that’s dumb
Your desk is bending.
EverythingApplePro changed his name to EverythingApplePro EAP.
Well its coming out today so well see
Great video of the up coming Apple event! By the way, the last thing you showed in regards to Samsung' work towards putting a transparent display on a smartphone, and how this can be useful,...then I would suggest you to look at Vuzix (https://www.vuzix.com/technology/next-gen) which develops see-through displays and incorporating them into smart glasses (just like a transparent display on a smartphone). These glasses will be commercially available in 2021!
No 120hz. Looks like I’m keeping my 7+ for another year!
This apple event sounds like one to miss
When are AirPods 3 coming out and how much will they cost
Hope I finally win
consider my hype completely dead
Tonite is the event. https://culttek.com/2020/09/14/insight-of-the-september-15-apple-event-this-year/
So there’s really no reason to upgrade to iPhone 12 when it doesn’t really have much to go on, disappointed other than air tags that’s about it. Samsung is more revolutionizing on their devices than Apple....sad.
No charger, no headphones, no 120Hz, no reverse charging...What to pay for now? Specs are from 2015, nothing much changed.
Apple Event 🥰👊🏼
Hey bro, you need a better Microphone! This mic have soo much noise
Those flat edges are really nice, wondering if it’s worth upgrading from the 11?
Just go back to Samsung mate we understand your a apple hater now!
Personally, I doubt that they will not even mention the new iPhone because normally they would in September, and everyone is gonna ask them what's going on if they just talk about the Watch and iPad Air. Here's hoping they reveal what it will look like at least 🤞🏼
Imagine if Apple Surprisingly Announces the Iphone 12.. If Apple Did That They Deserve Everyone's Respect!
Lol who's gonna buy that garbage with no 120hz display
Guess I’ll hold on to my xs max no 120hz or reverse wireless charging
Skipping the zoom class. But not for the event, because i like to skip classes😂
My iPhone 11 is getting old 😖
It looks so weird. I wanted to wait for the iphone 12 before I bought the 11 but now I'll just stick to 11 pro max
0:40 that is actually not the real deal
Is there anything cool features on the new iPhones at this point? lol
time flies... iphone 12? nope! iphone 20!
Lessen ur advs
No 120 hz ? 😑 I am switching to Samsung’s note 20 ultra!
well we’ll see at 12:00
Omg can’t wait for the 12 pro. I really need dat shit. My se is dying
Even if iPhone 12 pro max comes out android will always be better in everything
Fuck it! The notch is still there with same size of the predecessor’s. What we expect apple to improve is removing the notch or at least shrinking it somewhat! Not worth upgrading. Just for those who have plenty of money to waste on it!
👍🏻💁Big Breaking : 90% Chances for iPhone 12 release in Today's Apple Event.  You may see 2 variants of iPhone 12 .
iPhone 12 is just a big disappointment.
I just REALLY hope to see 120 Hz  :(
really liked that phone that looks like an iPhone 8 Plus and 11 combined. my dream phone came true.
U quoting everything from min che quo makes me think why doesn’t he have his own channel . Literally all the ipad critic youtubers i have watched from past 2-3 months all of them quote him . Intresting .
It look thick 👎👎👎
Has there been any word on a new Apple TV Box? I would hate to by the 4k one out already then all of a sudden they release a brand new one
I feel like he got into making cases just so he can get molds for new iPhones
The phone isn’t even released yet and we're already talking about it's restoration 😂
Finally I've been waiting for this EverythingApplePro😍😎😎
Can we just.. not do the pro naming thing for the watch. It’s silly, it’s Apple Watch.. leave it that way. The series naming setup is one of their best and easiest to understand
If the new iPhone has no 120 hz sure thing there is no new iPhone for me here. fck apple when no 120hz is coming. 2 trillion dollar company but samsung or other china low selling garbage smartphone company have this like for 3 years.
Apple Watch pro sounds good😂
No 120Hz. No Touch ID. No 3D Touch. Still 3x more expensive than competitors who do have it all. Brave.
Will they still offer e-sims ? I love this feature while traveling !
On the start, did he say “Hey guys, super excited for the vet tomorrow”....
iOS 14 public release date ?
Awesome 👍
جميل
Bit shit really.
So there will be no pro feature in pro models 😂🤦🏼
Decision made. I won't be upgrading. Barely an upgrade over the 11 Pro. Wow, square frame and Lidar. Meanwhile your competitors are making bendy phones (not in the iPhone 6 way)
same iphones year over year, what a joke of a company
I'm looking to switch from Note 10. I would give the new iPhone a try but that lighting cable is a huge minus.
When the f*** will the iphone 12 come!
7:52 samsung screens are not for wow factor if you want to have a in display finger print scanner you need a clear display so what companies do is put clear display above the finger print scanner only. so if apple wants to make a finger print scanner that can scan your finger any where they will need this.
Last video before the big event!!!
There’s going to be a depression sensor or something like that in the Apple Watch. This comment was made 5 hours before the event.
I am pretty sure each unit of air tag is not gonna be priced for less than 70 dollars.
Will theere be phone rebel cases for the Iphone 12?
There should be a model we’re the notch isn’t there because i don’t even use my front camera
No 120 hz, apple f u
No 120 hz, apple f u
If your looking for new innovative it’s not apple that’s forsure
iPhone 12 didn’t make 120 hz display... rip
Never used airpods on ny SE it would be a blessing in disguise
Why still 'made in china' ????
If they really not releasing 120hz screen iPhones, I'm gonna buy myself an android phone.  This is ridiculous... Even 250$ phones have 90hz displays, but Apple doesn't care as I can see...
‘Final’
iphones will be launching tomorrow
You said this like 5 times lol you are feeding into the new fake leak news
Let's hope that iPhone 12 series has some surprises. These leaks and 'final design' videos are great and all, but it doesn't mean much unless it's actual, official info.
When is iOS 14 being released
As an INTJ... The term "Pro" in your name irks me up... I dont get the sense and logic behind it considering that you review almost all types of Apple products... So why not just stick with the name "Everthing Apple"?????!!!😑
I thought the iPhone X was a big change. 3 years later, unrecognizable.
In other words they are not offering anything of value for this years iPhone again. The notch is still staying, no in display fingerprint sensor, no 120hz, no reverse charging, lidar sensor is basically useless as it's just another feature we are never using irl and tbh not so much interested in it, nor will it be fully waterproof as it will still have ports. Why should I buy this year when it's basically an iPhone X with a bit better camera? The new ARM macbook though is so much more compelling to buy. But instead they are focusing on other areas like apple car. Just make the BEST phone and I'll buy it 1000% but instead they don't offer abything of value once again.
2021 iPhone coming soon
I still can't buy I phone 7😂😂
No 120Hz is such a bummer tbh, I might get the S20 plus...
no reason to upgrade from XS....time to say goodbye
It’s fuckin sep 15 when will they fuckin reveal the iPhone 12 pro I wanna get it
finally, I get to upgrade from my iPhone 6
Should I wait for IPhone 12 or buy IPhone 11?
Should I sell my iPad Pro 2018 model before the newer air to maximise sell on amount?
No 120hz. It's amazing how everyone and their mother can do 120hz expect Apple, yet they did it on the iPad years ago ? I will save $1100 this year, I refuse to buy the 12 with so much features lacking on a flagship 2020 phone. And I am not just talking about 120hz..
So literally no reason to upgrade iPhones since the iPhone X lol yikes...
90 percent people dgf about 120 hertz
Plus according to apple the event goes for 2 hours. 2 hours for just a iPad and Apple Watch. Bull crap. Leakers lying
That licht blue mock up tho😍🔥
What will be the difference between iPhone 12 Max and 12 pro??
That's one ugly camera module.
Well I’m sticking  with my Xs Max smh. How much more time to do u need to add features that’s been out for years apple.....sheesh
ok no 120hz no reason to buy the iphone 12 pro max for me means i stick this year and next year to my iphone 11
Can confirm there most likely will be a new apple watch. Since on apples website, they removed the "new" tag under the apple watch 5
That bump is so stink. Awful. If you get any colour that isn't black it's going to look stupid.
Honestly this year's iphones at least from the leaks seem very disappointing on the high end. No 120 hz display is weird especially as many budget phones have it now. Lidar for now seems like a useless gimmick and 5g is just meh for now. I would happily swap this year's 5g feature for a fluid pro motion display. On the other hand budget lineup looks pretty good for those who want it.
no 120Hz, no new iPhone for me

So many ads 😰
They could shrink the notch for the smallest iPhone (which makes sense sure)  Why then couldn't they transfer that smaller notch to *all* the iPhones? Ugh
Transparent Samsung phones? Oh boi!
Thank you sir
I always come back after the products are released to see how accurate his leaks are.. he never disappoints!! I’ll give you an update after this year’s apple event
BORING! THATS NOT INNOVATION!
https://youtu.be/1slCbAfBrVE
WHEN WILL IT BE OUT? WHEN IS THE EVENT???!?!
Best designed iPhone ever
seriusly still no iphones? im done pathetic devices with only 2x camera lcd displays, terrible notch size horrible multitasking and no pen support, sd card support, DEX, reverse wireless charging, ...
Today we'll see…
Best iPhone design ever
<3
Last minute leak: iPhones comming 15th September 2020
Hi  brother what is your country name🥰🥰
Samsung transparent display v obviously for allowing the camera to see through screen, and (finally) getting rid of notch/hole punch imo
If leaks about the iphone 12 are true, iphone 12 sucks. What will they announce in the event" Hey this is the best iphone that is the same is iphone 11 but with the concept of iphone 5".
watching a video on apple , and seeing ads of samsung  in between ....and that too 3 times....blahh
I hope i can have one..🥰🥰😇😇
And this is leaks video number 12398018837782
What are the air tags?
1:00 - S.J. to the main designer in 2010 - pack your toys and get the fuck out !
Does anyone knows the release date of Iphone 12 pro max? 🤔🤔
It will be a big miss if the phones don’t have 120hz. When comparing it to phones from android, the display will be the biggest thing that makes the androids ‘feel’ faster, ever though they won’t be.   Also it’s been 3 years, if they don’t change the notch, that’s a mistake. They have stuck to the 3 year, same design moto for a few years now, so if they don’t significantly change the design (besides just the square edges) that’s a big mistake.   I have a feeling they will surprise us when they get announced. If the phone doesn’t get 120hz and or a redesigned front, I’ll be keeping my X for another year, as I think will be the same case for many others.
Can't wait!.
Wow no 120hz? Happy I got a Samsung, was half the price also 😅
I hope I get a phone in give away  But air buds are also not bad
Can see myself accidentally purchasing many things
Jon Prosser is a tool
youve been saying final leaks ever since the release of iphone 11, can you stop with this repetitive boring titles? thanks.
Extensively excited.
Super video! What about the new iPad Pro with A14X?
Just hope the body design is fake
I wish i had airpods pro but they are too expensive in India, my budget all went in 11 pro.. thanks for giving best review so that i got the phone
I thought you changed to Samesung?
So basically nothing changes as usual... no innovation.. they tweak the design just a little bit only to say that its "new" or "innovative" the 11 pro was a leap but this years iphone is a step back if not a freefall... shame on you apple..
Radio frequencies (= electomagnetic waves) to eject water??? Sound waves!
So what’s the point of upgrade if you have iPhone 11 Pro already , beside 5g nothing has changed , Apple sucks just as always
you cut the video too soon u missed the *peace*  lol still love you
Covid is a hoax
In sorry but apples design language is getting stale now. Nothing new nothing inventive just the same old designs tweaked and recycled every few years. Just boring.

Apple has gone down ...
I wanna SE plus 🤩🤩
I still think they are going to release iphone
if they made the notch on the 5.4 inch phone smaller, why would they not do that on the other phones too? i mean, if they could make it smaller, why not make it smaller on all the phones
M from India can I get one ??
One plus 8 pro and Huawei p40 pro plus best phones , Apple dising almost same every year
Finally a new ipad air i love em i have an ipad air 2 and it rocks!!
How many commercials can you fit in one video?
So with the 120 Hz not happening is there ANYTHING new with this year’s iphone other than squared edges and lidar?  Heck even the battery is getting smaller. Seems like a total disappointment...
That squarish sides would not be comfy in the hand.
Doesn’t seem like there will be a reason to upgrade...
So they can shrink the notch but not doing it on the other ones 😒
So with the 120 Hz not happening is there ANYTHING new with this year’s iphone other than squared edges and lidar?  Heck even the battery is getting smaller. Seems like a total disappointment...
Bro-you look like Jar Jar Binks with that red (seat-blanket-what is that) behind your head!!! ??? GREAT VIDEO though!!
its a THICC boy
Lets Hope They Announce the Iphone 9 because they ate it before.
Come out already 🥱
So basically it’s not worth it to watch the keynote, because they won’t show any iPhone which most of the viewer are interested to see
So basically nothing.....Congrats, Apple.
I have the iPhone 11 & I still wish I’m using the iPhone 6 best phone I ever owned.
I will be laughing hard if I see iPhone 12 in the event today😂
IM READY TO BET ON ANYTHING THAT THEY’RE RELEASING THE IPHONE 12 TONIGHT  SO YOU’RE TELLING ME THEY’RE GONNA BREAK THE CHAIN AFTER 8 YEARS OF RELEASING IPNONES ON SEPTEMBER????? NO WAY  See you when the iPhone is released😌
Damn disappointed once again
Still no 120hz oh god
they fucked up the rear camera design like the S20U
no iphone 12 tomorrow????
This is the least excited I’ve been for an iPhone
Clearly......all the leakers have no leaks.
Seriously, an 8 minute video and it has like 6 ads? Watched more ad time than video time. Not cool!
The leaks makes the iPhone worse phone not feeling you changed your phone
MYLovB
https://youtu.be/nPO9mj1rGFo
👍👍👍
Finally i can get an iphone xr lol
The fact that they’re keeping the same notch bothers me more than anything
If were not getting 120hz imma just keep my 11 pro max till the next year
newer iPhones are less and less appealing, really. 60hz and they still have a notch, I mean why would someone upgrade from the 11? I'm waiting for the notchless 120hz iPhone but knowing Apple that won't come out until 2023. my 8 plus will work great until then.
man I'm just here praying the iPhone 12 comes out asap coz my phones beyond scuffed
Dude apple is so behind
i will wait to final real event ! cant see this bulshit of leaks every day
After noticing Apple deleted all the iPhone 11 & 11 Pro videos on YouTube I’m now convinced they will surprise everyone by showing the new iPhones later on in the event, I’m hoping anyway🙏🏼
Hope it came true the 120 hertz screen...
iPhone 12 series not launching today??
https://youtu.be/e4m-FEvZatM  here to know more about the event
https://youtu.be/vCuzxRfTKbw
does this mean the iphone 12 will not get 120hz or both the iphone 12 AND 12 pro will not have 12ohz?
_WOW, I’M INCREDIBLY UNDERWHELMED_ 😔
I just want 120hz
Hope there's iPad air 4 and iMac 2020........
This has been the longest delay on knowing about what an iPhone has and how it's going to look ever. I'm honestly just getting tired of any kind of iPhone news right now but that's not really telling us anything about it. lol🙄
I need air pods
1984 has arrived. Proud of yourselves ladies??
i wont buy iphone 12 pro if it dont hve 120hz ..
Lmao I haven't been following apple for a minute(been using Android and loving it) and I come to your video and instantly laughed that they still have the notch
thank you for not having 120hz. I can keep my 11 max now
No 120hz display, barely any devices with 5G, 4th year of the notch and more than likely higher prices.... Apple seriously needs to step up their game
Why would they still make the cameras look like that!? I mean I like my 11 Pro Max. But you’ll probably see almost no difference if you put an 12 Pro Max next to it...
lol i live in western australia so the event is gonna be at 1am
Wow. More leaks. Shitty content
and then you'll release a new video an hour before the event and give it the "final final final designs leak" video.
Imagine a $1200 phone with 60hz in 2020
120 fps plz  Player pubg 90 fps
When I will get airpods 😘😍😍😍😍
Apple is trash dude
Every year we’re like “Well next year’s iPhone is going to be amazing then”
So no announcement for iPhones today, no smaller notches and no 120hz. Wow
Its gonna be the another disappointment of 2020 continuation of covid19...  There will no massive change from last 2  F* off
How i can participate this give away??
Why does the whole internet say that the event wont include the iPhone 12???? I bet there will be an iPhone right? Since they wouldn’t just break the pattern like that. Or else it wouldn’t be a big enough even to be called Apple Event?
They look horrible. Box phones don’t fit well either in your pocket or hand. Sticking with the outdated notch, no punch holes or touch ID with everybody wearing masks is crazy.
Philip not excited at all u can c it on his face 😂
I love you when you say hey what’s up guys everything Apple pro here 0:00 😍😍😅
Really hope you’re wrong about these leaks. Otherwise this is going to be the most disappointing release in a long time
Really Hope that we get the iPhone in todays Apple Event - Apple Pls announce the iPhone
apple has taken down all of its iphone 11 videos last night tho, coincidence? I dont think so
I NEED TO SLEEP! Why did I see this video now🤦🏾‍♂️
Simply embarrassing to not have 120hz. Absolutely no excuse. And that ancient notch. What a shit "upgrade"
Привет) У Меня Вышел Видос Про Кс Го Напарники. Посмотри И Поставь Лайк Пожалуйста
I’ve not received my AirPods giveaway after I purchased iPhone 11ProMax case from your site then thanks a lot cuz order delivered safely
Shame about the 120Hz. Samsung has variable 120 refresh on a folding screen FFS.  😔
Leaks leaks leaks and no finished product. Smh. Just do something else at this point besides YouTube.
Best phones bro.
Camera design is very bad
I just wanna know if the camera will look any different from the 11 Pro. I won’t bother upgrading if it looks the same, no matter how much better the specs are lmfao
After the event lets start with iphone 13 leaks!
i hope they have a good cooling situation. plus all of this locked down, Top to bottom integration will kill 3rd party repair. expect all of the repair costs to sky rocket.
whats the point of transparent phone
Every other flagship “we have 90-120hz display”  Apple: “We dont do that here”  This is real dissapointment apple didnt have to make it 120hz, 90 is good too.
This year yet again it's NOTch for me
watching and knowing very well i can't even afford an Iphone 6  : ((
Samsung s21 will kill iphone 12 with the stupid and old notch
no 120hz  no upgrade from iphone 11 pro max.   Is more than fast enough
all i want is Apple Airbag for my old car
Fake aisa nahi ayega
Anyone Know the Point of this video?  Why there is so many final leaks when u dont have one. honestly, i can make a sketch of 12 nd say this is the final sktech sent by jian some one from iraq / japan something. this is not fair.
Apple show start producing movies because the only thing they are good at is making fancy advertisements.
i like z fold 2 or LG wing
Why the boxy look again looks like the iPhone 5 style make the edges rounded
Earning on gossips
Watch this unconfirmed unprofessional video, or wait less than 24 hours for the actual thing...? And no I only commented and did not watch this video because it’s a waste of time.
Crapple strikes again with a dogshit upgrade
Thaioli
There is no point for the event to be 2 hours as they always are, unless there is a completely new product introduced by apple. I think they will announce all iPhones but they won't be available to order until October.
If the leaks are true and 120Hz isn’t coming, I ain’t upgrading.
Damn I wish I had money for the 12
It’s odd that reverse charging was such a big leak last year literally until the week of launch when they removed it. Why have they forgot about it this year?
The keynote is on today
Youre doing amazing work, love your channel, for me you are the apple pro
I want the 5G but I live in cornland nebraska and we barely get 4G sometimes 😀
Anybody with Xs Max feel that should upgrade ? Me not 😒
In my oppinion, this new design of the iPhone 12 looks way better than wahat we have now. I've always had a thing for the 4/4S design.
According to the chassis comparison, the 11 pro and 12 pro seem similar in size. Is it so??
Why iPhone 12 looks similar to the iPhone 11🤦🏻
No 120hz.. well no new iPhone for me This year
whooo broo tysm for this ifo
Well, guess I'm not getting an iPhone 12.  No 120hz means I won't be spending my money.
So essentially the most boring year for Apple releases ever! Also regardless of how much of a fanboy you are these recent camera modules look terrible.. fact!
I don’t understand why they use Face ID on devices where I’d dining makes sense. MacBooks perfect place for it and they don’t do it. iPad doesn’t makes for Touch ID, no one but grandma and grandpa uses the lock bottom to unlock.
I am just excited for MacBook with Apple’s hardware and software . When it’s going to be launched . I want to grab it as soon as possible 💯🔥
I will be content if they reveal at least an ARM MacBook, because it’s a MacBook that I need the most right now.
Except you really want 5G: if you have the 11 it’s not worth any cent. No 120Hz -> No deal
So excited
You should watch his old video leaks, all are BS
How many times has leaked this iPhone 12  till now boss?😀😀
So instead of having 3 nipples we're having 5 now?
120hz makes quiet the difference, therefore 1 more year of iphone 6s i guess 😔
Silicon Macbook Pro????
When’s ios 14?
What are you most excited for at the event? Me: Apple Watch se and iPad Air 4
I love watching these things knowing I can’t afford it
Anyone notice he changed the channel name to EverythingApplePro EAP
i know everyone is gonna get this phone at my school there all rich snobs!!
still hoping for a iPhone event tonight
Jon prosser fake guy
I thought WWDC 2020 is on the 22nd?
Nice to have AirPods Pro
More videos! 👏👏👏❤️
I don’t understand how leakers came to conclude that they’re not revealing the iPhones LMAO.
I don't see you that much upset about the lack of 120hz... I really want to see if Apple will ask 1500 usd for a 60 Hz iPhone 4 like.
second time here
😍😍😍😍well said brooo... allwys you rocking
Omg samsung is making the phones from henry danger !!!!
iPhone 11 Pro Max and Watch Series 3, you won’t be replaced yet. Don’t worry. *pets gadgets*
I think TouchID is going to make a big comeback given the mask wearing that will continue for the next few years.
Amazing video
No promotion? It stays in apple store!
Imagen being able to afford the iPhone 5
can't wait for the event later
clear displays in glasses?????????
Apple seriously is going to sale “new narrower bezel!!!!” that’s it! ... no other changes! That’s it! $1299. 2020 surely sucks!
The see through display would be great for AR on a phone despite the move to AR glasses.
But where is the flash of that chassis?
The only person I trust with iPhone leaks an news 💯
There is still time to make another FINAL leak video if you hurry. Come on, let's go for 4 final videos in a row.
What is millimeter wave?
FACE ID during a pandemic with masks is no different from TOUCH ID during each and every winter where its cold enough for gloves.
Which next one👀
the iphone better be in tomorrow’s event
Just disappointments from Apple
Lmao no 120hz
I wonder how long my iPhone 11 Pro Max has until it starts to die from updates then ay😂😂
Sound is horrible u sound like ur in a big metal echo box
I hate iphone 12 is not coming out on 15th September. I have been waiting for ip12 for sooo long!!!
See through displays😂 you’d just see all the stuff inside. Surely it’s just for under screen cameras or something....
I honestly think Apple sometimes orchestrates leaks, cause they know the hype it creates.
Imagine iPhone 11 Pro Max SE 😂
Wow sounds like the iPhone 12 specs this year will be so underwhelming. nearly  every phone manufacturer has a 120hz display now.
No 120hz is deal breaker
SO NO MACBOOKS ??????????????????
If everything we hope for doesn't arrive in the event expect a mass dislike bomb
No 120Hz, No 5G capability, No charging brick? That's a bad Apple.  Well  my Xs Max  can wait  for another year then.
But apple has closed the iphone factory in china ??????? OR Not
So the event is Friday at 12 p.m.
This year earlier I had planned to buy new iPhone, but see date is going far 😭
Who’s still using iPhone 6s  #6sGANG
I really hope the leakers are wrong
Wow 2020 has gone by so fast i remember like it was yesterday when the iPhone 11 came out
Every week there's new video on 'FINAL LEAKS'? Nice.
No 120hz might be the reason I wait for the 13, everything else is what I want just missing that to make me switch over
I wanted a the 3 burner to be upgraded to a 4 burner stove top. 🤦🏼‍♂️😂 I don’t quite get the layout they’ve gone with.
'Fun fact' i made you fool two time   Read more
Without 120hz is a waste
At least, they have to revile iPhone tomorrow
Love from india
Apple has nothing new coming up with iphone 12. Boring..🤐🤐
You forgot to announce that Spacial Audio is now available through iOS 14 beta 8
Wanted to go from android to IOS this year, but no 120hz ? nah bro its 2020 already... Still staying with android until another Iphone that could interest me. PS. Still with a fat notch ??? 2020 ??
Man I really want get that airpod pro  But how  I'm from Morocco and now living in UAE damn
So it’s basically the same phone !!!
5g and new squared design  is literally the only thing I'm looking forward to. Wish they went all out and out did themselves. Such small incremental changes
What is EAP?
How is the EAP Museum going?
Will the iPhone 12 have quick charging
Soooo airtags won’t have a keyring hole?
I’m getting the 5.4 PERIODT I can’t wait!!!!
Give more credit to John link his channel atleast
You hyped for what ? Piece of metal that isn’t rounded but square like 10 years ago ? 😂 sheep’s stay sheep’s
✨🌈
May I have iphone 11 pro plz 😭😭😭🙏🙏
They already have all those folding phones 📱 and new technology I’ve seen it!
What about iOS? When it will be officially released
event today
APPEL always surprise us with their iPhones which are beyond a smartphone
First time I  saw the iPhone model I thought these were made out based on your video
That mock-up is ugly. I hope that isn’t a legit body
Luv from India ❣️
What about Macbook Pro14, is it coming ?
Can’t wait until the iPhone 12 comes out
You forgot to say peace 😄
120 Hz refresh rate IS a big deal and the fact that Apple is not offering it yet again this year is (in my opinion) unacceptable. The engineers need to try harder. If other flagship phones are cheaper and  have it, there is no reason why they cannot figure it out. Don’t give them any slack, they are a $2 trillion company with endless resources. I will go as far to say they should not even give it the word “pro” without this feature, as The IPad Pro has had it for three years. And I don’t want to hear any comments about the fact that Samsung will not give them the technology to build it into their phones because they are hoarding it for themselves… Again They have ENDLESS” resources people… Where there’s a will there’s a way!
Do a galaxy note 20 review
these things are bluff
The iPhone 12 better have 120hz display
It is so disappointing that Apple could not get the 120 display, apart from 5g , what are we getting that's different from the iphone 11 ? Its all just cosmetic. I have been on the edge of swapping to Samsung as Apple do not appear to be evolving their products in line with current market requirements, relying solely on customers devotion to the brand.
nice

What’s an air tag?
How many times does this guy say Min Chi Quo.. ;-P
Apple Glass??
Last leak video for 2020 :( bye
Your name was everything apple pro
You should put you’re iPhone collection in picture frames separate
Bummed about no Face ID on the iPad air.
*Samsung Ad*
A good week for Apple Spatial Audio and automatic device switching just came in for the Pros
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2URWEo3Qng&t=2s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2URWEo3Qng&t=2s
Whats gonna be the point of buying pro model if there is not gonna be 120 hertz and both have oled???
Let’s see what they will introduce today 😎
Am actually excited this year. Only because of the new iPads
Just want apple to go up n stocks tbh
Those cameras are so ugly, steve jobs would not approve
Who else is getting a 5.4" iphone12 just because it's small?
I am waiting for type c in iPhone. Friends of mine who use latest android tech are always wondering when I, with my iPhone 11 Pro ask for a LIGHTNING cord. “What? That’s still not a type-c?”. My iPad and MacBook already got type c (long time ago), so one connector for all makes sense
Honestly without 120 refresh rate screen and mmWave 5G on the 12 Pro model, IMO its not worth paying the premium for upgrading specially when even the charging brick not being included in the box!
Next year's iphone will be called 12s. Not 13.
When will the iPad Air 4 release?
I just want the micro led iPad😢😢😢
Im an android guy mostly, have a ipad 11 pro and i love it. Was thinking on switching but 60hz 😬
What’s the update on your other land you purchased?

Your tomorrow is my today :D 11 hours left pfff
You’ve been saying “final designs” since I can remember jajajaja LAME
Will iPhone 12 be in the Apple store in early 2023? Just curious
Let's hope that apple surprises everyone by announcing iphone 12.
Once again.... This year's leak is actually next year's leak
I would imagine that 120 Hz and 5G would just be too much of a drain on the battery
It’s gonna be hard to tell the difference between the 12 pro and 11 pro out in public
I need the iPhone tomorrow, not in October 🥺
if this event is nothing but watches and ipads imma be PISSED. at least air tags(fits the "time flies" theme like ipad air) and studio headphones.
Any jailbreak news coming soon?
I like your videos. I’m in overseas job in Afghanistan
Atleast do a 90hz screen it is late 2020 and everyone is still stuck on 60hz panels😂
What are the new features? It looks like nothing has changed between the 11 and 12
don't like the notch.....so mostly not buying it "again", will wait another year and c....may buy the oneplus as it offers better value
2020 has been the year doe Apple 12 leaks & let’s hope it lives up to its expectations?
If they can shrink the notch, why not shrink it for all of them?
Cool
iPhone 12 expected features leaked:  Face ID & Touch ID: No longer happening Smaller Notch: No longer happening Different Camera Design: No longer happening 90Hz/120Hz: No longer happening  Apart from the chassis redesign, will there be ANYTHING worthy of an upgrade on this year's model?
Tomorrow's video : IPHONE 13 LEAKS!!!
There's No Point Of Calling A PRO If It Doesn't Have 120Hz
After a year ... feeelin like still not a big upgrade...   i thnk  am gonna buy z fold 2 this tym
Let just hope that there will be an iPhone SE 3.
I’m expecting a video on iPhone 13 leaks right after this
Love how every leak this year has been the final leak.
airtags for $999... today's wow statement . ' may be blue on your wrist, and blue in yoyr pocket in october '
I'm not digging the box design tbh
Why call it 12 when feature upgrades barely happened? Just call it 11S!
To many adds in video
Who else is watching on iPhone 6s Plus
𝕀𝕥 𝕝𝕠𝕠𝕜𝕤 𝕗𝕒𝕟𝕥𝕒𝕤𝕥𝕚𝕔
Can’t wait till the actual Apple event
No iPhone tomorrow? I’m gonna talk shit if you’re wrong
Another minimal update to a clearly outdated device especially, refraining from variable refresh rate & usb C which is basically a standard now. P.S. looking forward to ipad air.
🤣🤣🤣
Gand
I’ll wait for iphone 13 meanwhile building a PC
So amazing and most beautiful look iPhone 12pro
That g easy shirt go hard
Exited about 12 pro
How can one of the most advanced phones in late 2020 still have a 60hz display? OnePlus can do it, all other companies can do it, but Apple can't?
If apple doesn’t step up, I’ll switch to Android after years and years of getting the latest iPhone every year. They’ve had 120 hz display reverse charging, 5g, etc for so long. I believe apple does it better and more refined for each feature, but just increasing cpu speed is not gonna cut it for me this year. At this point i’ll settle for the shitty version of a feature instead of continuously going without it. Like I want these features for myself not my grandchildren.
what are airtags
Please stop using prosser as a source jeez, he's nothing but a condescending clown
idek why I watch these it's not like I can buy this lmao
Why just one mic? Isn’t the iPhone recording in stereo?
😍😍
❤❤
I was actually thinking about buying an iphone after 8 years with Android...but if the leaks are true it will definitely not Happen 😂😂😂 60hz 😂😂😂😂 1500$+ in 2020 with 60hz 😂 there are 300$ ohones with 90hz
It looks bad NOTCHing Changed
May we will have a “One More Thing”
No 120 hz LTPO microLED displays then you just lost another customer
apple is slowly becoming a joke.
120 hz display is not necessary and useless and only works if you can make a LTPO display and microLED display.
Why always over iPhone
Camera design SUCKS. Creativity ZERO.
What are airtags what's the use of it?
so there’s literally no point to buy the new one this year
I can't wait to watch you wreck these new iphone models like always, i just wish i could have one😂
Where are the deep water tests
xd it’s been only a month since i bought an ipad air 3
Rip reverse wireless charging
This guy is trying so hard to figure out how the iPhone 12 will be since February. No news here.
I knew this fir centuries that the fourth lens is not gonna be a gas stove
Should i buy iphone 11 or 12 ?
I still have the iPhone 8 + 😅
lol so apple said “ok I guess we will look at foldable displays” and Samsung is like “we are moving in towards transparent displays” lol. I can’t with the tech industry. Neither one of those technologies are useful in a smartphone. Maybe in another device but not a phone.
Gonna break my lecture to watch the event lol
i'm gonna be new in ios which charger brick should i buy which watt?
I'm glad it doesn't have 4 cameras 😂
As an Apple Fan boy it’s sad to know that Apple is quality and a rip off simultaneously
60Hz screens in thousand-dollar phones in 2020 😩
Might be upgrading from the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 12, or maybe next year I will upgrade to the iPhone 13 or iPhone 12s whatever it’s called
How do u get these leaks?
I don't see much need to upgrade my 11 pro and iwatch 5😑
Atleast 90 hz is expected
5 min after iphone 12 release   noone: EAP: BRO NO WAY! WE HAVE NEW LEAKS ON IPHONE 13 PRO, PRO MAX, AND THE NEW MODEL CALLED SPECIAL EDITION. NOONE HAS THIS INFORMATION LIKE I DO SO SUBSCRIBE SO I CAN DROP IT!
Wow lidar sensor looks cool❤️
all i meed to know if itll have that big ol notch ñile the previous ones. if yes, easy skip for me
Just got my crystal series case for my iPhone XS Max and it’s by far the best case I’ve ever used. The included tempered glass screen protector is so nice too. The clear vinyls for the sides are the cherry on top. 10/10
P.s. I’m not a fan of folding phones
I knew that Apple couldn't pull it off go Samsung!
I love u brother 😁😎
Day after iPhone 12 release:  “Hey Guys!, New iPhone 13 leak!”   iPhone 12 Owners: 😑
I really hope Apple could surprise us with the iPhone 12 in this event
Me: excited for the iPhone 12 My wallet: I’m bout to end this mans whole career
See u soon for the into or details for the iPhone 12s when October or November. release date for the iPhone 12. 12 max 12 pro and 12 pro max For me I have the iPhone 11. and i have been waiting of the release date of the iPhone 12 max. or the iPhone 12 for me it will take me about 1 to 2 months to save up the money to figure out. what iPhone 12 I’ll be getting when October. or November comes to the iPhone 12s in 2020.
I am not sure what we are really getting with this year’s upgrade (other than a slightly squared off body).  This will be the only flagship phone with 60 Hz display.
Went ahead and bought a note 20 ultra. Tired of getting old tech with apple
How many years of “buy next year, that’s where the features are gonna be” are we going to get?
I feel Apple is prolonging the new iPhone purposely just for hype...
No iPhone in this September event.
They want to see how many people order without 5G capability. It’s a lot more radiation, and waves on our bodies, more then double of 4G.
Apple is "Great".
This years iPhone sounds disappointing tbh. General public doesn’t give a fuck about lidar and 5G
Hi💖💖💖💖💖💖
I really want to upgrade,any news on AirPods 3 ? Will they be better than the pros?
Airtags? What’s  that can somebody please explain
What about “the one last thing” that they do at the end??
Apple needs to take a break...about a year or two. ReFocus on what made them popular in the first place.  IMO, they are all over the place.   AirPods vs pro version. By apples standards “Pro” means better.  But the convince of the OG AirPods are much better in all aspects. Couple that with the fact if you don’t own a usb-C adapter...SOL The stem...useless on the airpod...so they shorten it and make it useful...but rather than add features we want...volume control...they take away the tap option from the OG AirPods and add a pinch?  They keep the all white color...fine...but then you add rubber fittings which get dirty, making the pro look like corner store Bluetooth pods. 😂   For them to be “Apple” the moves they’re making are very elementary.   To cut cost they remove the adapter from the box and charge customers more to get one... Now let’s consider that what they say in these Apple events about the iPhone being faster, better battery etc etc are true.  What sense does it make to keep a adapter that’s been around sense 2007? 13 years... 13 years of Apple events claiming that “this years iPhone will blow your mind” so keep those 5w adopters ladies and gentlemen...😐  Thats like taking your QLed 8K tv and running it off of 4 AA BATTERIES...  I want this years iPhone for the change in the chassis, always loved the square/flat design...but Apple has become a disappointment.    Last years iPhone key selling point, was the camera...who wants to bet money, that’s this years selling point as well...what’s the goal here? Shoot the next Avengers movie using only an iPhone?
Any word on the 16" MBP refresh?
All this hype for a Apple Watch and an iPad 🤦🏽‍♂️, I want to see iPhone’s not a 2 hours watch and iPad only event
Who is watching this on iPhone 11
More reasons not to upgrade (again) this year. My 6S is never gonna retire at this rate 😭
...who remembers when we were talking about under-display cameras 3 years ago...  Everyone liked that(it actually happened a few days ago)
I hate the news tgat said it’s no iPhone in September!!! This is insane!!!!!
I love apple products but they are falling so far behind other brand phones. I do not understand how they are not getting things other brands have had for a couple years now? I hope Apple steps up their game.
No 120hrtz aint gettin my money
I think I might just wait for next years iPhone 12s
The 12 was so good in the beginning and gradually became worse
everyone excited to see the event tomorrow  me “ooo transparent phones” 👁👄👁
S10 lite or xiaomi mi note 10 pro
i love you man
Transparent Display = Under display Camera
If the notch is still there, then it’s NOT worth buying.
Time flies? Flies🧐 something major coming
Prosser is wrong, they are all wrong. Iphone 12 will come today
One day You come India man 💓
Hey, if I pre-order the Rebel case for my Xs Max today, when will it arrive?
Boring boring boring!!
sir can you please give me airpods please sir
any chance of ios 14 dropping?
Ooooo
if there's no 120 hz then apple really fucked up, most 2020 flagships have it at this point it'd just be embarrassing
No 120hz I just can’t get it not worth it for me
Iphone 12❤️
If everything about the latest iphone leaks are true are there is no 120hz display and a more or less same camera as the 11 pros ill just be keeping my phone until next year.
😭😭😭 Don't......
Been with apple since the 4s. I love my iphone but every year its the same thing with apple. They take baby steps in upgrading their software and hardware. Every fall season is so disappointing finding out the changes are so minimal.
Bro I literally keep waiting for you to upload apple latest leaks😭, love you fillip!!
If all this rumours a re true about IP12 pro, bruh Im switching to Samsung. No 120hz refresh rate, notches is still the same size? Daamn.
who real for iphone 13
This is the real iphone 12 pro https://youtu.be/inFHPsTi0tI By caviar if you dont know caviar is a company that customize phones and sell it for about 5000$$ to 40000$$
Iphone still 60hz displays lmao
should i get the 11 or 12
i hate the flat edges, why are we going backwards??
so for real we are not getting anything new :D GG apple. Samsung is strungling fucking badly and you dont even try to. Seems like we need more and more competion to get better devices.
MKBHD: I’ve been using iPhone 12 pro max for a month now...
The best iPhone for 2020.👍
When you want to tune into the apple event     But its at 3am and you have school later. 😔
I must say I am a huge fan of the iPhone but this is just to much . how is it possible  that a company like apple is just lagging behind like this . are they just being greedy ?? they need to bee up to date not like this and the square design camera set up was way better .
no 120hz?!!! iPhone 12 will be trash!!! 😤😤😤 only 5G?!!😑 thats the big Update?!!! 😤😤😤
First thing I noticed was the T-shirt👕, omg that album💯💯👌🏽🔥
Clickbait
I got 5 ads in 8 minutes. Ok YouTube
If it has a notch I’m gonna just get the iPad not the iPhone.   (Edit) I own a iPhone XR if anyone asked.
Well guess no Iphone 12 for me, no 120hz in my 12 then no spending $1200 in 2020
I hope apple always offers future phones without 5g capability
Never have a ever seen this guy go wrong since day 1
Apple: No 120hz for iPhone 12  But         Will be coming with a 119.99hz screen.
Apple has been working on internal part stability for a while, wait for the 13 from someone who repairs iphones for a living a lil bit of iso alchohol and an air compressor fixes most speaker issues whereas the 6s and below  would be completely fried... apple has the capacity to do this but are becoming increasingly lazy with water resistance and software support for batteries. This design change is bigger than anything they are foing for the phones, iphone pro models should have already become a made to order product with a slightly higher pricetag $1500 with custom colors and higher capabilities. apple is no longer a luxury product but a consumer product that masquerades as a luxury item. Stuff this this dum stuff I stopped getting excited for new iphones after the 7 and yall apple fans know how unimaginative the new phones are s really died with the iphone xs and theyve been coasting off his ideas since
Will Iphone12 have TOUCHID?
How many final leaks are going to be there?
why is there no iphone air
Lol so basically. "Hey! We have this iPhone here that's about to come out without high refresh support. But don't you worry, we will 2021!" The point is buying this gen then. In fact, just go get yourself an Android. They already have 144hz displays now.
Honestly a little disappointed that Apple’s still releasing $1000+ phones with only 60 Hz displays, more than a year after 90 Hz phones were introduced (though I know nothing about what it takes to design a phone).
iPhone 13 gang
Question, will the iPhone 12 max have 3 lens like the pro versions or just two? Thats somewhat a make or break for me on which versions to get
Apple users: Who cares about 120 hertz we have lidar and chip and new design.   Apple users: Shit another thousand dollars while the world moves on.
Waiting to take!!!!
I was seriously considering an iPhone this year but with no 120hz, that just seems lazy as fuck from Apple. The upcoming 8T and even the freaking Samsung S20 Fan Edition both come with 120hz at less than 800 bucks.
I’ve been waiting for an EAP 12 video, cheers mate
Oneplus 8 Pro or Apple Watch
My guess is Apple decided against 120Hz due to the drain it places on the battery. 5G already tanks battery with the current state of 5G implementation...5G + 120Hz and the battery hit might be very substantial relative to the form factors they are working with. By the next round of iPhones, 5G efficiency should be much improved and battery chemistry could also be better.
I phone 12 series will be my favorite design ever.
As a iPhone 11 user I will not be upgrading to the iPhone 12.It simply isn’t a big enough upgrade to justify buying it. If they have 120hz,a smaller notch,and maybe some form    of Touch ID in the iPhone 13,I would consider upgrading
I’ll be disappointed if they don’t announce the iPhone 12 tbh
Wtf no 120hz😞
This is not the iphone 12 That’s why is not as “new and re designed” as we all where hoping for. This is an “S” year Iphone 11 pro S I mean....how many years have apple been doing this? Come on guys!
I just dont get it, my 2 year old ipad has 120hz, cant you just implement in the 2020 iphone apple?
60hz???? In 2020???? Shits way behind it’s time 😂 I guess we gotta wait another year to buy a new phone boys
Wait! What?👻
Summary of the video:Do not buy this year's iPhone. 2020 and still no 120Hz.Pathetic
Wait so nothing changed
Apple will disappoint I guarantee it.
Iphone 12 is basically better version of iPhone 5- Apple is Fooling People
So, what’s the type of material in the back of the iPhone 12 now? Are they gonna keep having glass or are they gonna be metal like the edges?
It’s the same shit every year.  Apple never gives us consumers anything to get excited about. There’s always that excuse of couldn’t do it this year but next year we will include it .
Nice
Can I pls have AirPods I never tried or had AirPods and all my friends make fun of me for not having AirPods and I entered too
Very disappointed
square shape againnn🤢🤢🤢⬜
Airpods studio 🥺
My 8 Plus just hit 79% in Battery Health lol
All I want from Apple is the iPad Mini Pro please! PLEASE!
There is nothing named 12 for iphone it will be called iphone 11 S.  and so on
Under 10 min. Impressed
how tough the glass is gonna be on iPhone 12 against the 11 pro max which is already very tough is gonna be a video to watch out for✌️
Boooo no iphone 12 at tomorrow’s event
Please do iPhone 12 giveaway..I will win it 🙏🏻
This saddens me I didnt buy the Iphone 11 because the rumors for the Iphone 12 seemed promising but like always next year they'll be better forsure..
iPhone 12 shouldert be expensive then iPhone 11 Pro max
No new design for the Watch, and no Pro Motion for the iPhone— see you next year, Apple! 👋🏻😉
Who is this Jon Prosser ????  Every leaks are all done by him ??  iphone will be released today After all it's an apple how could they delay the most awaited event ?  I'm sure they are back with the bang 💥
So when is the new iOS update being announced?
no 120 hz no iphone
Annnnddd the event starts right when my classes do
Waiting for Touch ID to make a return until I buy a new iPhone. Until then I’m rocking iPhone 8 Plus.
Wonderful awesome super
iPhone 12 pro or pro max doesn’t have 120 hz, me not upgrading, me keep ancient iPhone 11.
You can play backgammon without losing your pieces with the airtags
Upgrading from a 6s to an Iphone 12 Pro. I’m real excited.
Wait 4 12pro
It’s sad that you’re only doing leaks these days, which are not really that interesting! Miss your drop tests, water tests and reviews.
Man apple need to just release there i phones 🤪🤪🤪
Looking forward to this.  I need these walls!
How are you guys so deaf?  2020 isn’t for 120hz  If you look at 2021 in reverse it teases it [2021] | [1202]
How many more final design leaks are there going to be?
Who else is skipping this boring a** phone 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
Probably going to hang on to my iphone 7 Plus - gets the job done, has a fingerprint scanner, has 3D touch, no notch, slim and looks good. Thought I was going to be upgrading this  year, this shit still dosent have 120hz, lightning connector, and still have a notch??? Its been like 4 years and these phones still have those ugly notches. No thanks, no real reason to upgrade.
The hype around this event is insane! im hoping to see some new iPhones announced fingers crossed 🤞
Didn’t the 11 just come out 😭😭😭
Wait so they're getting rid of the charging block, no 120 hz reduced battery size but the price is rumored to go up? Wtf?
Wow... please do a phone giveaway toooo... please 😇
Imagine flagship without 120Hz display in 2020 😂😂😂
Waiting for time stamps🙄
I’m getting really bored with Apple. It’s sad, I wish they’d innovate more.
That blue color is beautiful
I am starting to think this phone can take a pictures ....
Can I have some iPhone from you please any units it's ok please iwish that you will notice me
Without iphone 12 it's useless event
man this has to be the least excited I’ve been for iPhones in awhile, this is the 2 year version and it seems like a worse upgrade then a S year. No freaking 120hz yet again meanwhile Samsung has 120hz built into there freaking foldable phones...
Who else had class during the event but is still going to watch the full thing without paying attention in class?
At this point, idc about 120 hz or 5G, I just wanna upgrade from my iPhone 7
iPhone 12 is already old news, can’t wait for iPhone 13
I wish we would get a New Ipod Touch next year 😔
Don’t know about y’all, but no iPhone announcement will be garbage!! 100% garbage. Why would they hold an event for an 8th Gen low budget iPad or a gimped feature 2018 designed iPad Air 4? I just don’t understand this logic.  So for me and mines, this event tomorrow with no iPhones announced would be the biggest disappointment in tech for 2020.  So yeah, I hope Apple proves the leakers wrong and shows the iPhone 12 even if it doesn’t release until October/November.
How to participate to the airpods pro giveaway?
So excited for tonight!!
I want your garage tour 😅 it’s been a while
1,240th comment
The live event is 1 am tomorrow for me 😭😭😭
Honestly this years iPhone is so underwhelming, the z fold 2 is drawing me closer
Yeahhh iphone 12 release in 15sept
No 120Hz? No iPhone for me this year. Smh
Starting at 1 kidney $
The chassis feels cheap af.
Guess I’m upgrading to the Galaxy S20 FE this year.
Apple has really been letting me down for 3 years now... I have a XS and Apple has brought out variably the same phone since the X ... that’s 4 years almost the same phone just little little changes.... we really need a née innovation.
Past EAP: last iPhone pro leaks!    EAP now: more leaks!
Could this event hint at Apple Watch - iPad synchronisation? Since it will just be those two main devices?
Does it fold/flip or wing tho 🤔
144Hz or 240Hz not 120Hz
Waiting for notchless iphone
Huge disappointment if this final leak is real😔
Stop with the ads
HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Free the Apple Series 4 watch!!!
I work in marketing. Apple will announce the iPhone 12 at this event tomorrow...
Why the EAP on your name it makes it too cluttered
Final video until tomorrow morning’s final leak
How are these even “pros?” W Lidar is BS literally nothing new
still M notch No 120hz less battery than 11 pro no screen touch ID Worst Camera design (Never thought 11 pro camera was beautiful...)   if iphone had not own chipset, I might be using Galaxy, NOT IPHONE
Tomorrow not today
If I do upgrade from my iPhone x, I will maybe just get the 11. The new iPhone flat edges make this feel like an outdated phone .. like an iPhone 4 but bigger
Should’ve been an S year
Nothing good lol - trash
Oh for crying out loud MacBook Pro, Mac Pro, iMac Pro, iPad Pro, iPhone Pro, AirPods Pro, and now Apple Watch Pro??! What’s next Apple, Apple TV Pro?!
i always watch your vid i like you a lot and i will ways want an iphone plzzzzzz
I am praying that you are wrong 😭 I want 120hz today
I think they will announce iPhone 12 in tomorrow event. It would be lame event if it’s just Apple Watch and iPads.
i can’t wait for A14 and Iphone 12
What about for iPhone 7 case
Finally Got a Video From You. Tired of watching shit leaks since weeks ago of ur last video was released.
Hahaha  No 120 hz in 2020 😆 Apple is digging their own grave.
60 Hz when everyone is taking it to 120 Hz lol Apple is falling behind, great job.
Love how you use someone elses information that has less subscribers as most of your facts for your presentation, but you have more subscribers. Looks like stolen information to me, making money off of someone elses hardwork.
The ipad air: More air than ever
Im waiting for ipad air 4 i started saving up to buy it with the accessories like smart keyboard folio and apple pencil
How powerful will be A14 bionic from A13 nionic in percent?
I only watch him cause he is handsome lol! Other than that, he talks to much, mkbhd seems more on point, and more handsome lol 😂
Why is there still a  notch??
i rather to get the note 20 ultra
iPhone 12 100% tomorrow
I’ve lost interest in the 12. I’m going for the z fold 2 from my 11 pro.
Give away is fake... As all this youtuber people will say that they will give a Give Away if u do this and that after doing as they told we won't get anything 😢 or may be they will give only to people who is local not for those who stays in different country like India etc   By the way I love ur channel 😍 keep it up
iPhone 12 will be so boring.
if airtags come as a pop socket, im happy
Waiting for the iPhone 12 drop test lol
so how many "final design" video left in your mac?
Sucks that it’ll still have a 60 Hz screen. Apple is really falling behind these other flagships
I love Apple
Imagine all the leakers are wrong lol.
Hmmm, lots of folks too caught up with the “new” flat edge design of the IPhone 12.....when most of us will cover it  with a protective case......my current IPhone 11 is hunter green and the last time I saw it was right before I stuck it inside it’s new case, oh well 🤷🏻‍♂️
I'm sick of APPLE disappointments......
I watched Jon’s video on the AirTags yesterday and thought for sure you would render your own.
Samsung ad on everythingapplepro
I think they will announce the iPhones tomorrow, it just doesn’t make sense to focus on iPads and Apple Watch. These iPads are not even the pro models hahah they could have just done a silent release on them. They are traditional and it just wouldn’t make sense to not announce it this month like they always have previously. I think they will announce the iPhones and some models will just be released at a later date. 😆
All leaks will be wrong as usual 😂😂😂
The fact that so many leakers cant come to a concise agreement at what will/won’t be at the event shows how much they could be wrong tomorrow.
Finally i can upgrade my 11 pro!
I can’t wait for my upgrade. But please let me win at least once in my whole life. 😊
120hz is just not happening...
I dont even know if i should upgrade from 8 plus to this or get note 20 ultra or wait for next samsung lol
Most features don’t make the cut, because all Apple care about is profits
I’m gonna stay with my iPhone 11 Pro I still love it won’t be upgrading gonna upgrade till the 13 comes out
I think Kuo is as clueless as other leakers since it won’t even take an hour to announce the watches and iPads so either they actually are including iPhones or something else to fill the time.
Time to sell my Apple stocks.  Same phone with only a design change.  No 120hz display.
They just charge you for the same shit endlessly.
Love you Bro🤩😍😍🥰
no Pro Motion on this year iPhone... 💔
Another fake leaks , like every year
ill skip class if this gets more than 1K likes
Hope Apple totally shifts its manufacturing out of evil China.
No 120hz and same sized notch.....they’re making it really easy to just upgrade to 11 pro
Who’s gonna wait for the 2020 iPhone models 🙋
Apple stock 🚀
You cut off the "Peace" at the end there :(
I love watching things that i can’t afford 😁
But dont have 120hz for Pro version huhuhu
Great video 🔥
New bottle old wine 🍷
Yeah I’m def sticking with the 5.4 iPhone. Fuck the 12 pro it’s so ugly
Nice shirt! These things happen when it’s dark out #g-Eazy. 🔥🔥🔥👑
then, is IPhoe release going to be tomorrow or not??
Yes the event is happening on my birthday
guys , Don't Trust Anyone!
Hope apple actually finesses us and reveals that iPhone 12 will have 120hz
I'm buying iPhone 12 pro and airtags.
No 120 fps Fuc all
I’m happy I don’t have school till October. Now I get to watch the event.
That looks sweet
I won't be upgrading to a 12....not without 120hz i'm fine with my 11 until Apple gets their head out of their kazoo!
I feel bad for iPhone users 🤣
Wow the time came
🥰
Good information thank you
I’m 1hour late
Hello
I love it my bro keep up the work and I love the video 💯💯💯💯
Yo Apple:  I dgaf if you don’t change a single thing in the new iPhone... just gimmie that baby blue @ 3:59 !! I need it!
Just ordered the crystal case then gen 2 is On The Way 😂 , guess i am late to the party
what will they do for the clear case
Well with the 12 I will not upgrade , the no 120 hz is a deal breaker
When is iOS 14 coming out ?
But SAMSUNG has already has ltpo dispay :(
Awesome YouTube video
There is literally nothing special about the new iPhones, I could easily wait another year.. I have a 10X Max..
I've been with apple the last 8 years and I'm happy to say I jumped ships to the latest Samsung ultra plus!! No regrets apple have just done nothing new for the last 5 years nothing no to ita ios.
apple: we'll use radio frequencies to spit water out of the speakers kpop stans: blasts miroh bass boosted on max volume and watches water come out as we twerk
I really want to see tomorrow’s event!!
The new iphone is not impressive at all
Instead buying newest iphone ... Buy shares of apple to create own wealth
nice Young Gerald shirt 😎almost bought the same one 😂
iphone12 is coming tomorrow
Designed in "californium"🤡
Yeeeeesh 120hz was literally the biggest feature/difference from my X that would make it worth upgrading
Man, if that baby blue iPhone was real, I would cry of joy.
Looking forward to the drop test
I was planning on getting a blue iPhone 12 pro this year, but I am now very happy I switched to Samsung.
I’m kind of upset with Apple. I have been a customer since the iPhone 3. It sucks to know Apple has gone to trash this year
How many times are you going to leak iPhones this week?
SO BASICALLY NOTHING MAJOR BUT NOW WE PAY FOR POWER PLUG WTF?! I’ll Just get a Samsung note!
Hit like if you excited for tomorrow apple event
I was hoping so much but at reality nothing more change..
All hype about a device released every years! To be honest i don't understand why people are so excited. This year it's simple for me. No 120hz= no buy. I've already sold my 11 pro max (end august) to save max money for my next device. If no 120hz i'll go with note 20 ultra
👍👍👍👌👌👌👌
Still no 120hz? Damn
I don't need a Airpod because I have a Samsung Galaxy j7 Max😢😭😭
0:23 some kind of subtle strobe effect going on
Not a major change in iphone 12
come on Apple, reveal IP 12!
Yo yo can’t wait till iPhone 12 comes out
Anyone else getting bored with Apple
I really wish/hope we could see the iPhone 12 tomorrow man
iPhone 12 series will be announced tomorrow at the event.
iPhone 12 will look exactly like the iPhone 11. Spoiler alert
Apple just lost 2 customers
Sexy af
Me: Mom, can we get a Galaxy Fold 2? Mom: No, we already have a Galaxy Fold 2 at home. The Galaxy Fold 2 at home: 7:40
Where to get one?
'Everything Samsung Ultra'😂😂😂
cant wait for this years iphone.
Sir can you please give me airpids Please Please Please
Why do people keep bitching about 120hz? So useless
14 hours to go
So... I’ll be basically seeing the iPhone 11 “redesign” .. .. .. .... Uhhh.., no.....this years been a bust already....   Mostly...
Hi . I am from India big fan of u. I wanna AirPods Pro. I can’t buy my self. Please send send it me
I don’t know if I love or hate the flat edges. It kinda ruins the round aesthetic.
Very very happy
Fold no! Please!
Wait a minute did he change his name
*tomorrow* Apple: ...and here’s the iPhone 12  . Everythingapplepro: what’s up guys so surprisingly apple released iPhone 12
Damn, I wish it really had the 120 Hz but it is what it is
Everyone else: Looks like iPhone is sticking with 60Hz this year EAP: Looks like iPhone is sticking with Boring Motion this year
Wah Apple news and Samsung m51 ads 😂😂😂
Will these iPhones be a global release? Or just a US release
Can you add more intonation in your voice? It's hard for me to pay attention. :-(
May we need both🤔
Just got the notification and it came out an hour ago!
Your cases are no Mous cases that’s for sure. Bought one. Not quite as high of quality and I doubt the drop protection is as good. Great looking case though. Sucks 120hz isn’t going to be happening... What’s the point of the series 6 watch? Better processor? What do AirTags do?
It’s all most 2021. Even budget phones come with at least 90hz refresh rates. If these rumors are true, there is absolutely no reason to buy this phone. A message needs to be sent to Apple that consumers want innovation! Steve Jobs would be rolling in his grave. No wonder Jony Ive left
I don't think so apple do 2 lunch event in this covid-19  situation 🤔
Focusing on the Apple Watch, I’m no doctor but I wonder if there is any useful information Apple Watch could be able to get from our forearm near our wrist. Perhaps they put technology into the portion of the watch band that wraps around that area. Maybe it would be able to take blood pressure?
I am still on iPhone 5s
LOL MADE IN CHINA i love my S20 Ultra (made in Korea) #samsungdoes #198fortnite
It feels like every year they push back all the good feature leaks to the next year and so on for like 3 years
How would I ever have gone about my day without the knowledge that the motherboard will be placed on the other side of the phone.
No I phone 12 for me
Without 120hz, I’ll be going another year with iPhone X. Nothing excites me or really makes it stand out enough as new without that feature. Changing the camera every year isn’t that exciting.
Even if iphone does get revealed tmr, we'd have to worry about the possibility of 120Hz. Imma get a heart attack watching tmr
No 120hz
I’ve been hearing 120hz since 2017.
Apple is such an embarrassment
Why are they struggling with 120Hz when everyone else is doing it?
In the video tags Apple says iPhone in it as well as Apple Special Event. There’s no way they would just put that in and not say anything about the new phone.
Me and my dad are pre-ordering the 12 pro max and watch
How would someone be notified if they win the giveaway?
That’s such an ugly camera layout for the iPhone smh
HIS CHANNEL IS GROWING ONLY BECAUSE OF JON PROSSOR
I’m 100% betting they’ll announce the iPhone second maybe then iPads third than the iMac because how can a 2 hour video not be for an entire gadget setup? ( minus out airtags and etc ofc )
Okay, u need to fix ur phonerebel giveaway page. So buggy, so glitchy. Can’t even enter the giveaway using the phone.
iPhone 11s
If fucking asus and razor can make 120hz work, so can apple with their trillion dollars.
I don’t think the Canberra would look like that, as it looks too much like the 11 Pro, therefore the 12 Pro might be mistaken for the 11 Pro. I predict it will look like the old Canberra design leak
They couldn’t even build the tags in the US? Had to outsource that to China? Come on now.
Touch id vs face id... Which do you think is better
Man apple cant even use a 120 hz display in 2020? . Well thats apple for you all.
Bruh no 120hz? Why would I want to upgraded my iPhone XS Max to the new iPhone?
I will buy 11 pro
Everything apple pro always leaks question paper before exam....with help of his senior john.prossesor🍎
I don’t think not having touch id was an issue, but rather Corona made them go back to developing it
So I have to KEEP WAITING for AirPods Studio??!! 😭😭😭😭
This is the third "final design leak" video you've done in a row
Iphone corona 6.9 inch display !
Personally, even as an Apple user, the 12 sounds like a real let down. I’m seriously considering going for the OnePlus 8t when it comes out. Maybe if iPhone 13 kills the notch, adds at least 90hz, and adds back some form of touch idea I’ll come back.
Go away jon prosser
Thank you for sharing!Hope everybody here becomes successful on YouTube :)
Honestly, the 120 Hz is a dealbreaker for me. I was going to buy it if there was 120 Hz. Guess I'll just wait until iPhone 13
If you remove the home button and what is left of the bezels in the original iPad, you just destroyed of whats left of the original iPad lineup was. Keep the bezel-less design on the iPad Pro models. We don’t need a design die off, a design very successful
I would be so disappointed if no 120hz was true
iPhone 12 is such a disappointment.
Soooo......nothing has changed.....🧐
Woahhh I’m excited for the day that see through phones existsss. Sounds so far fetched but hahahaha would be cool to have one
All iphones will look like same 😳
Tomorrow .... hey guys everything iSame Pro here
I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I hope the leaks are wrong about 120 FPS not happening... PLEASE!!!
No apple watch series 6 tomorrow, until october or iphone 12 launch
*I’m skipping my zoom class to watch the apple event*
Leeeeeeeeeeks
Various viscosities of water
Been watching you since 2016 best YouTuber ever!
Man I can’t wait ‼️
Me: excited for the event tomorrow  School: dont even think about it
which model should i get🤔
Waiting for the first official review 😊, from dubai 🇦🇪
Finally❤❤❤
Whose watching the event while in school tomorrow?
>
Me: wants to watch Apple event   Mom: no you have school work
I am watching you when you wer 100 k please and I have never won a giveaway please can I be for airpods
Let hope they don’t release a other iPad Pro I bought my yesterday
I love watching this and learning about the new iPhone 12 but I know I’m not going to get it .
Add a public comment...
The new iPhone's are so disappointing.
No 120Hz? big No for Gamers
Don’t usually win giveaway but why not give it a try but see u tomorrow at the Apple event n love the rebel case just order one too
So what will be the point of IPad Pro if the New IPad Air sounds so similar ?
So what will be the point of IPad Pro if the New IPad Air sounds so similar ?
😂 60hz Screen. My note 20 ultra got a 120 hz and APPLE don’t even got wireless power share, that feature is a game changer and has been out for two years. Apple out here ripping off all they customers and y’all fr paying too much for that shit phone.
really REALLY hoping that they talk about the iphones tomorrow
Nice bro
Will the iPhone 11, 11 pro and pro max be discontinued when the new iPhones come out?
What is a mm wave
As someone who is an Android and Samsung user, 120hz is really not that huge of a deal. I have the S20+ and Samsung tablet. Both devices are very fast. The S20+ has the 120hz display screen while the tablet doesn't. I use both of them a lot, and switching between them. I never get bother switching between 120hz and 60hz as some people would have you believe. I know everyone's milage is different, but for me it's not been that big of a deal.
I have to wake up at 3 am Australia
If Apple stores are closed, how are we supposed to see the new hardware in person before buying?
Didn't know you were living in PDX bro. I'm in Portland too. Hazardous air quality right now.
Eagerly waiting for Apple Event
Hi
Why would you put an AirTag on your iPhone though???
WTF right, 120hz is should be a standard now.
I dunno, maybe it's just me, but iPhone seems to be rather underwhelming, just doesn't feel special. Maybe I will change my mind after the presentation, we'll see
Красивый получился аифон 12 👍👍👍
Bunch BS so u can go drop $1000 on something that is the same shit🤔🤔🤔
yooo peep the G eazy shirt
I just noticed you changed your named from ‘EverythingApplePro’ to ‘EverythingApplePro EAP’  I personally like ‘EverythingApplePro’ better
I think Apple shot itself in its foot by not giving 120hz and making all models Oled.... I think now the only thing that seprates a Pro from a Non-Pro is Build Quality and cameras
Can’t wait to see the new iPhones tomorrow. Edit: With 120hz.
Did you make a video right now?
It’s the real deal because... you said so? 😂
So this iPhone is releasing in 2020. 10 years ago the iPhone 4 released. Thats why the design is boxy and flatter.
It’s sounds like nothing new.
I don't even use iPhone's products, I just came to watch you. It's the most beautiful thing in the huge world 🥰
This looks like trash 🗑 lol I'm glad I switched from my 11PM to my new Galaxy note 20 ultra 😅
Watch rene Ritchie this guy is d rank leaker
Every year after iPhone event: Next iPhone is going to be crazy that has everything....  Gradually: A is dropped, B is delayed, C didn't make into production....   These leaks just hype everyone up and then disappoint everyone. iPhone was way better when there was no leaks....
With Online school I can watch the event without worrying about ditching class to go to the bathroom to watch it.
I feel so bad for iPad Pro 2018 users. I’d imagine people buying the iPad Air they be flexing their “iPad pro”
The funny thing is a guy on reddit says Apple has a team and their goal is to send out fake leaks so maybe min chi quo or John procer could be wrong and the iPhone and iOS 14 would be announced tmr
what time is it gonna be
I'm debating whether to get an 11 or 12 since last week, watching EAP videos somehow help.
Highly disappointed about the lack. 120hz
no 120hz 😑.
I don't have Insta for the giveaway 😭
Brother or could you give me iPad cause that can help in editing and learning programing cause I'm doing BTech in computer science.... And that might gonna help me please do a fever on me🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Yesss SO Exited
Bru am I the only 14 year old that watches all about phones and tech if your 13,14,15,16 like this
120 hz has been a thing on smart phones for around 3 or more years now, and apple isn’t just implementing it yet, that says apple is far behind on purpose for no apparent reason. I’m not buying this years iphone because of that.
Please try the LG STYLO 5 as i have fried my phone with a outlet by charger but then it came back alive after 3 days of sitting out not on a charger.
Thanks for the info
Im kinda disapppointed with the new iphone, i feel like it’s barely doing anything new or different, guess im not upgrading my iphone XS max
Need another 11 Pro but Gold option and only if I can get it on discount.
I did everything for the give a away
*Lol it's 3 A.M in the UK and I'm watching EAP like it has to do something with me buying the new iPhone.*
I did it
Please could you give your old iphone 11 pro🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Not even 90hz? Poor Apple
I'm waiting for a surprise at the end of the event just like what happened with iPhone x ;)
Boring iPhone this year
Hello Brother please I need you help 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
14" APPLE SILICON MACBOOK PRO INSANE
My iPhone 6s will be missed
If they can make the notch smaller on the smaller phone, why can't they make it smaller on the larger ones? Also, nothing is confirmed until Apple says it. All leakers are wrong sometimes.
Man! Why you don’t give the “Spoiler Alert” at the beginning of almost every video? 😂😂😂
No iPhone 12 announcement. Bummer 👎. This event will be super, super boring.
I wish they would show the new iPhones tmr but guess not :(  and also I think it is kinda stupid for them not to release the 6.7 iPhone because now I am gonna have to wait :///
Looking forward to the iPhone 12 Pro so I can immediately buy your phone case
Hmm. We shall see.
I just order the case you sell, im excited to get that!! looks great quality hope It is
If this is true.... What's the point of buying or upgrading?  I'm so sicking tired of the Apple BS back in the days with 3gs.
I'm most excited for Samsung's "transparent display" idea!
Apple is a joke
Soooo... If they could shrink the notch on the 5.4 inch iPhone 12, why the hell wouldn't they do it on all the other models too?
Just got my rebel case and it’s amazing. Great job
Wait til you see what tech is in this years iPhone, it will blow your mind!!!!   Ok... well it didn't pan out like predicted...... BUT next year's iPhone will be EVEN BETTEERERERERER.  Looks like I'm keeping my 11 pro max for a another 5 years before Apple decides to "invent" 120Hz on a cellphone. 😤 😡
"unclear of how this may be useful"  me at any fold-able phones
Only thing I dislike about this video and majority of Apple fans is u spent a full 7 and half min talking about what Apple ain't bringing this year and then announces Samsung working on transparent screens  but yet don't see how it ll b useful I don't see how all these patents useful if they never use them Samsung literally has every type of phone even flip and foldable but ppl rather hype an iPhone xs max in a square design until its jailbreakable its the same shit as 2 years ago and further
Go watch my yt it’s 210 smokzzz
I have classes tomorrow 😭😭
I will love to buy that gaming chair that you have .. That color red looks so lit 🔥 and also buy the case definitely 🦾
I'm happy I got a xr in January. Definitely waiting for iPhone 13...hoping in screen touch ID, always on display and 120 hz next year
Need some cases for the samsung phones
Transparent displays would probably be for smart glasses, not phones. Just a guess.
I can’t wait
Is the iPhone 12 getting Apple Pencil support?
No 120Hz display, no iPhone for me this year! 🤷🏻‍♂️
that website doesn't work
I think iPhone 12 is gonna be released tomorrow
I am only excited for the iPhone 12. I don’t need a new Apple Watch and a new iPad. But I do want upgrade my iPhone.
Superb
Amazing video
I will see ya there 👍👍 Can’t wait
will it gonna be live?
If you want to know exactly how big the air tags are just look at the charging puck for the Apple Watch. That is also how you will be charging the air tags.
Have broken 8 plus I will get 12 for sure
Most boring year ever IMO, they are making lots of value options and that’s great but I was hoping for some reason to upgrade that would make me satisfied with a purchase, Instead I’m feeling like I should hold onto my 6s for another freaking year. If I do decide to upgrade it will be out of desolation and necessity.
where's the peace?✌🏻🤔
🔥🔥🤜🏻🤜🏻
innovation from apple is really dead... oh next year 😂 bullshit
The cases look great. I might just pick one up with my iPhone 12 pro
Who else waiting for the ps5 event tomorrow!!
Ngl, I really can’t trust Jon prosser’s leaks any more 😭.
So basically nothing changes in the new iPhone 🙄
Airtags look sooo cool
A two hour event for a watch and tablet.....I still don’t believe. Guess we’ll see tomorrow
There's no way they can release the iPhone 12 Pro with no 120hz
I hope Apple pulls a shade and launches the 12 and 12 max, I really wanna buy it
Followed since 1mil subscriber video, still a big fan. Thank you for the value and take care. God bless🤟🏼🖤
I bet Apple is announcing both 6.1" iPhones tomorrow. 5.4 and 6.7 will be on October.
Apple, the type of company to put the word “Pro” in it. Wait for them to add the word Everything
If that iPhone 5 retro look is legit, I’m getting that over a car, no cap
Holy crap another iphone that basically is the same as last year's!!! I can save money now and wait another year
I hate that camera setup I truly wish they stuck with the quad camera layout, looked so much better.
Why is he so certain there’ll be no iPhones tmr? Just because of John’s leak? I’m certain there will be iPhones tmr. We shall see.
So the square design like 5s is 100% sure?
Have you heard of teck 21
so is the mini done for?
6:18 californium is an element. It’s California.
iPhone 12 tomorrow
I’m still on the iPhone 6s Plus watching this 🙂
Will there be a magic keyboard for the new iPad?
I can only dream of having a iphone
So, when was the last time Apple had an iPhone only event? I’m not saying that it will be revealed tomorrow, I’m saying that something else will be announced during that event.
Looks like I’ll keep the money I’ve saved for a 12 Pro Max and buy next year instead. I just don’t see enough to justify a 12 Pro Max. So one more year with an iPhone 7 for me.
Just here for the iPhone 13 leaks. Oh wait, wrong video...
No 120 hertz 😞
What will the price of your upcoming phone case be?
This year lineup: iPhone 11s iPhone 12,12 pro, 12 pro max
Have you noticed that EveryThingApplePro change his name to EveryThingApplePro EAP
if your reading this please give this post a like......i want to see if youtube is giving out proper notifications on my macbook pro.......thanks!!!!!!
Disappointing iPhone 12. But hey, I guess I’ll get it to switch carriers
Do you play video games? Or on your phone?
haha, nice joke by apple not giving us the 120 HZ screen.. well I guess I will not be buying a new iphone this year even tho I wanted to :)
best youtuber ever
Well I don't think so that iphone 12 series will be a good device for fps gamers or even normal gamers including me though
I’m getting pretty tired of apple tbh. It’s like the same thing every year. I’ve only ever had iPhones since the 4  but it might be time to go
Since the phone is relatively flat now, maybe the magnet ring is for cases/covers similar to the iPad line that uses magnets to align itself  Or maybe it's just for wireless charger alignment 🤷🏽‍♂️
Hey  dude I just woke up now and YouTube notification came from EAP
Everyone is praising a product that's miles behind in technology of Chinese and Korean androids. I don't get it?
I wonder when IOS 14 is coming??
Who else thinks the new iPhones WILL be announced tomorrow? 🤚🏻
I’ll be right on time for the event...in my dorm..  comfy in my bed 🤣..with my MacBook
Who’s watching the event tomorrow during virtual class 😂✋🏼
How are you supposed to charge airtags
So many ads..
What happened to the mac book pros?
Looks like I’ll be holding on to my IPhone  X for another year.
see u soon for restoration iPhone 12
greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
The notch is like herpes.....you think you finally got rid of it...and it comes right back.😂
will the iPhone 11 go on sale after the release of the 12?
My broke ass still stuck with the 6s and without a career..
I’ll stick with my 3rd gen iPad Air if the 4 uses the pro design I don’t trust how fragile it is and how easily it can bend it break in half
iPhone 12😍
We need 4k videos now that iOS & iPadOS support the VP9 codec!
Man I love when my 11 pro notifies me of his new videos, can’t miss a single one lol
R.I.P. my dreams for a 120hz display
I don’t need any of this.
Is anyone else feeling really fatigued this Apple rumour season? Too many reversals on features coming and then not coming etc.
No iPhone 12 tomorrow. iPhone 13 instead. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
EARLYY GANG
Bro  i love your videos😍😍😍😍😍
No 120 might as well not come out this year
Me, with iPhone X: “ok, another one, great”
Who wants to buy my iPhone 7 Plus with Fortnite? :)
The flat edge doesn’t looks good to me.
Guys, reserve judgment for tomorrow, anything could happen.        EDIT: this aged horribly.
You didn’t say peace ✌️
Apple is really out of ideas for their “new products”
Is anyone else happy that thers no batery battery 120hz?
I’m ready for tomorrow...
IMAGINE: we were all completely wrong and ALL 4 iPhones models get dropped tomorrow, all with 120Hz.  Apple would have flexed on all of us
No 120Hz is such a buzzkill. Was the only feature I was hoping for. Doesn't justify the upgrade for me without it.
No 120hz no upgrade for me....
They could shrink the notch on the bigger phones (like they did on the 5.4") but just didn't. Lame.
If the “tag” is accurate I see zero use case for this. WAY too big
This will suck big time if the 120hz won’t be happening. I am keeping my 11 pro max.
120 HZ makes no sense on a smartphone. Faster battery drain, More $$, will probably only be on the Pro models anyway, 120 hz on a 7 in screen is harder to make and makes no sense thats why we have ipads
Thank you everything apple pro
Basically the 120hz has been on and off because the leakers are trying to make us unexcited for the iPhone 12 pros and when the iPhone comes out we get excited to hear the 120hz. Logic people!
lets go thanks for the updates
Plz send me one ☺️ iPhone big fan from Nepal 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵 plz if you see this message plz send or take with me 😃
IPhone is the best! Like!!  Samsung sucks.
I so hope that not having 120hz is fake ☹️
Bro sometimes my face id works with masks like idk if ot ios 14 but it works better and bettee when i wear it
I guess apple won’t get my money until next year.
i don’t think i like the flat edges ☹️
I’m wondering why I’m watching this video without intentions to buy anything and since the even is tomorrow
I will believe this stuff after all the events and only then. No offense, great videos dude
I don’t like the boxy design. It feels like we’re going back to the iPhone 4. I personally like the rounded edges better. The iPhone X housing is the best looking yet -again, in my opinion. It’s more sleek looking
only one more day before i find out if my phone is going to be last gen for another month or not
Anyone notice the “EAP’ at the end of EverythingApplePro
I think I’ll be waiting till 2021 to upgrade my iPhone and 2022 for my Apple Watch. I have the iPhone X rn and the second generation watch
I HIGHLY doubt the Event won't have iPhones at it. How do the leakers know the contents of an Event they didn't know existed?
so what are the chances the actually announce/reveal the new iPhones at the event?
The sexiest and most durable cases on the market are by far mous
Looks like I’m keeping my iPhone 11 Pro for another year
Apple should’ve followed suit and made the Apple Watch 6 boxy like the iPad Pro and iPhone 12. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Just sayin.
I heard from a little birdie that MacBook 14” and all new iPhones will be at the event tomorrow
I'm still very skeptical about a 2-hour long event just to announce iPads and an apple watch...
I hope Apple surprise us tomorrow 🤐
Who else is really sad about the AirPods studio not coming out tomorrow?☹️☹️
Prediction !!  Year 2121 : iphone 120 hertz creen..  2122: iphone faster the 2121 iphone With gimmicky shit  2023: imbedded finger print screen  reader...  Take this shit to the fucking bank!!!!
It’s a shame to see what’s have become of Apple...
istg we better get ProMotion, ESPECIALLY if the iPhones are being delayed. If not I guess I’ll be sticking with my XS Max🤷🏽‍♂️oh well😂
I’m starting to get bored with iPhones:(
Who else’s “Hey Siri” went off at 3:33?
Just saying, I’ve aleays hated that notch. I intend to get 12 Pro. But then the notch won’t change. Then no 120Hz either. I really think keeping users away from satisfaction as a must by Apple, duch as the darkmode. Well, been a loyal Apple user ever since 4s to X. Maybe Apple wouldn’t care less anyways.
Finally 😏
Without 120hz useless iphone
Can you do a review on Samsung note 20 ultra
can i have a iphone 11
Can i get a iPhone giveaway of the new iphone 12 when ever you giveaway them
So they made the notch smaller only on the smaller iPhone 🤔 ......it’s not even logical I swear Apple be on 1 😂
Imagine getting pinned by EAP
What’s coming but never arrives?
I personally prefer Face ID, is easier and for me it always works but because of fucking COVID and the use of masks it’s completely ruined
The apple tag design is genius that way it camouflages pert
This iPhone is going to be so underwhelming. No 120Hz, ugly notch remains the same, smaller battery? Hard pass. And that sucks because I skipped the 11 to save money for this supposed major upgrade.
Thanks   iPhone 12 battery ?
Those camera bezels are fat as phuck
me:what iphone 12 cool him ;brings up iphone 13 me ;come on give me a brake
Why it so THICKK
EverythingApplePro EverythingApplePro. am I the only one that sees this?
Bruh the renders look amazing best I've seen
I have a series 5 Apple Watch ⌚️, should I upgrade to 6?
What's up apple....its iPhone 11 but no charger 😕 😒 😐 😢 😑 😪 😕 😒 😐 😢
oml, so your telling me we won’t see the iPhone 12 until October.... great, hopes gone.
These leaks are💭😯😯🔎
New name?!?!
Wtf... did not make the cut???  What you really need to say is if apple makes the 120 display this year  apple won't have shit to update for 2021 iPhone....
So no new MacBook?
It’s not exciting to see the apple events now a days. Look like they very behind when it comes to technology compare to samsung.
If no iPhone tomorrow I will turn the event off. How’s this an evolution over the iPhone 11 series?
I'm so excited. I miss my iphone,😭 gonna have to save hard for this one
Why'd you change your name?
Who else is waiting how the AAPL stock will turn after the event?  👇🏼
I CANT WAIT FOR THE LAUNCH!!!
I believe the iPhone 12 coming out tomorrow because Apple has always come out with there iPhone in September
iPhone 12 final leaks part 5.
Apple glasses what about it??
Message to nerds, we’re superior kings y’all all loved
This is literally no need for a update this year
Who else is excited to see Apple prove all the leakers wrong as usual!?
Second
https://youtu.be/A6iCMsNaFyA
The upgrades become more minimal every year
And like that, my iPhone 7 has to hold out one more year. No 120Hz means no iPhone 12 Pro for me.
Can’t wait for the iPhone 11s
I just want to scrub through Monday to get to tomorrow’s event 😅
I hate u😂
No 120 hz it’s gonna hurt a bit
മലയാളികൾ  ആരേലും ഇപ്പൊ ഉണ്ടോ ഇവിടെ 😁
i see no reason to upgrade from 11 pro max
Wow, no 120hz, so new processor, boring lidar and its square. I’ll keep my 11 pro max until next year I guess. I also don’t care about 5g yet. But that’s just me
If I payed attention in college like I did to his every word on here I’d be president
Can’t wait!
You changed your channel name?  There's a new suffix acronym
I really really really want those AirPods Pro please!!!
i hope they at least announce the new iphones tomorrow
Can’t wait for this event!!
what exactly are the airtags????
359 comments within 8 mins. That sick
I’m actually confused what will be worth the 300$ price gap between 12 max and 12 pro...
Anything about the new HomePod?
Who else hopes Android gets destroyed ?
this the best YouTube channel for us nerd, everyone say thank you Proffesor Pro     ps. send me a new car plz🤣 life’s hard
Imagine Apple blows everyone away and makes the 2021 iPhone have a 240hz display
Eh, don’t care about the watch
Who else thinks Apple isn’t going to release iPhones at different times?
i swear there has been 20 "FiNaL lEaKs aNd dEsIgN" s
So... We're all gonna just ignore the fact that Jon was just exposed?
Hey i’ll say it since he didn’t... “Peace”✌️
They aimt showing shit tomorrow, bummer
I wish we knew the colors of the standard iPhone 12. That’s literally all I’ve cared about all this time.
I feel like I’m the only one with the iPhone 10 when it came out
“Innovation”
Yes! Can’t wait for the event tomorrow!
if there isn’t 120hz then i’m getting the iphone 11 pro max, that was literally the only feature i was looking for 🤦🏻‍♂️
No peace at the end huh
No 120hz? Man I’m going to Samsung fuck it
Alguém BRASIL 🇧🇷 assistindo também?
Airpods pro😍😍😭😭😭😭
Iphone 12: fastest phone ever,  Iphone 12 5g: fastest phone just got faster.
If there is no 120hz then they should have At least given us 90hz to stay close to the competition...
🔥🔥🔥
I still think they gonna show iphone cuz apple always showed iphones in September and never another month
Gonna be one disappointing iPhone with no 120hz and only lidar. Hopefully Apple has something else but for some reason I doubt it.
I have a feeling this video will be disappointing with features and full of ads.
What about iOS 14 ;-;
Can't wait to see sheep getting trolled again 🤣
El Roquito del concreto!
Does anyone know wtf an air tag is?????
This iPhone will suck Apple needs to stop we see other phones with the tech and it’s flawless it’s BS I’m going to android
No 120hz 🥺
I’m a little disappointed for the iPhones but we just have to see tmr
Samsung z fold makes apple iPhone outdated..
Pohuy. I'll still buy it
What time the event is?
Apple LITERALLY makes 40 Devices per year-
no 120hz , no money from me
EverythingApplePro EverythingApplePro?????????   wot

Me: _wants to watch apple event_ Schoolwork: *NO.*
YEAAAAAA and what’s with the everythingappleprox2?!
I wonder why he hasn’t been doing the iOS 14 Betas lately. Too busy finding every change in every pixel, I guess?
I can't wait!!
Кто бы хотел увидеть это видео на русском?
Wait for new MacBook
bro 120hz was the only reason i wanted to get a new phone and now this is just gonna be basically an iphone 11s but with a square edges that’s so dumb
They still might announce the iPhones
Can someone tell me the prices for the new iphones?
bruh wheres the flash????
Lol, how are they going to make a clear display with all the internals? Like, that'd be terrible.
Unpopular opinion but i like the matte finish from the iPhone 4/4S bezel rather than this glossy finish
dude I love your content
2020 has probably been the wildest ride in regards to leaks
aye I love you guys, just wanting to let you know I feel guilty watching these videos...I don't know it is just like feels illegal for some reason.
Just watch 120Hz tomorrow 😃

Excited for that release event tomorrow. Hopefully they release something worth it after some disappointments from the leaks.
I wish I could watch the Apple event, but I have a biology test during that time :(
I wasn’t going to click on the notification because I am doing homework  But then I saw APPLE WATCH PRO?
