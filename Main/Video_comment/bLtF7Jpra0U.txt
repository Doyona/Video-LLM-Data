Steve nicol regrets saying he wants to face Liverpool. Liverpool fucked up in defence too yet they can’t make excuse for hyped up VVD
People underestimate defensive players A LOT in football. They lit up the adrenaline for the entire grp of players with match saving performance. They spark a fire that turns the tempos. That's what Mendy or Courtois. A goal can change a team's mentality in many way A match saving tackle or save can do same. Thats a fact
3 years later and hearing the cries from Stevie 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hala Madrid 😃👍🤍 🤍
2025. Still haven’t gotten over this incredible night. HALA MADRID
Nedum really is the only guy who acctually played for City and the one who without any doubt explain it the best.
going into a EUROPEAN FINAL against real madrid, no matter how bad they were in their previous games the true favorites are real madrid. they haven’t lost a european final since they went up against saf. it’s impossible to believe that they’ll be the easier opponent in that situation
i think city were just bound to lose after that goal. they were celebrating like the final whistle had went off and you can see them start to relax
1:15 Wow….I was looking for this one🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Real Madrid still dead even now 2024
what is really sure,  is that there in USA you guys dont know nothing about football, so shut up and talk about baseball and all those stuff you play there, Real Madrid is God
Everyone said that real Madrid wasn't doing anything, then how did they scored?  Absolutely dumb pundits.  Real Madrid was attacking and eventually one went in and Man city was done. The look on the faces on man city player after goal by Rodrigo tells you the whole story. They were 100% sure that they lost.
I'm re-watching this 2 years after Madrid beat L'pool in the UCL final and Steve Nicol's delusions never ceases to crack me up😂😂😂😂
Do you remember this man city ?
Steve saying he rather play Real Madrid than City in the final, who they have not beaten in ages 😂😂😂😂
2 years later and their still doing it
@1:13   Big facts.
I was watching this match in my hostel.. There was a big Zubeen garg(biggest star in our area) concert just next to our hostel in the same night, except four people everybody went to the concert but After the  goal by mahrez even those people who were watching with me said leave it we will lose lets just enjoy the concert and went... I was the only one that stayed even though i had ticket for the concert i did not  went to the concert just to watch the game.... Ohh boy was it worth it... I was all alone in the hostel.... When rodrygo score the header..... My friends cameback all drunk and were super jealous to know what they have missed...LOVE YOU REAL MADRID...
Who is here after RM reaching 2024 semi 😂.. these pundits 😂
English bias at its best! 😏
Time to go again! C'mon Madrid!!! Let's do this.
Somebody is bitter 🤡
I just love Ale Moreno talking about Real Madrid ❤
Miss this time, what a time to be alive
Here we go again😂😂 LET'S GOOOOOOO CITEH
History shall be repeated tomorrow.. hala madrid siempre!
1 year later we are here again. 😂
They again pick City over Madrid not learning anything....real football against organized moneycity by pep,  no doubt who wins again
Funny enough same stage of this competition real Madrid is still being underrated by bookmakers and pundits
The “they were dead, Dead, DEAD” from Ale still gets me everytime 😂😂😂😂
Real Madrid wins over the oil industry every time
"Certain little things didn't go their way that turned into be enormous things" Stevie the GURU of Football
"If you give me a choice I would rather play Real Madrid" lol Stevie Liverpool got smacked up
Whytf is there an author on the show?
I've been watching this for the last several months and everyone talks about Curtis, Vini, Mendy, etc, but if grealish had just taken the ball to the corner, this match would've been over. Blame him!
Man city is useless they don't have eufa spirit to be compared to real Madrid
This bald guy is useless how do u coount out real madrid in champions league
We are the king , 🔥
Its not voodoo its GOD. We as REAL MADRID fans PRAYED. HE HEARD OUR PRAYER. HE saw how we were UNDERESTIMATED right from the ROUND OF 16 DRAW in December. We drew BENFICA but got PSG
Please get better pundits. Ones who put the game on top. Not their own teams.
Ale thanks for your analysis..... Straight up
Never give up
All analysis is nosense!
Man alejandro played football in mls league & 42 games for Venezuela when even the big league rejected players didn’t go to mls to play football. What does he really know abt football?!  Forgive my ignorance; I meant soccer. Can’t really say much to a guy who after finishing his career learned that the game is called football  & not soccer.
Lies. RM were not dead. Even before scoring goals, they were creating opportunities.
I love this video, as a Real Madrid fan, I'm in ecstasy every time I remember this day. But wonderful analysis from Ale, I've watched this video a hundred times already
Ale Moreno the goat 🐐
Did Liverpool want to play against Madrid in final?
Who is still here watching this conversation, it's so funny and ironic, especially hearing Steve Nicole saying he was happy to play Real Madrid, what was he thinking? Well, I think he has exactly what he asked for. They play RM, and they lose the final.
11:41 HAHAHAHAHA dawg, Stevie got it all wrong
Every now and then I come here to watch Steve Nichols. His pain and rage at seeing Real Madrid knock off his favourites one by one is only matched by his shock and bewilderment.  It's at once hilarious and pathetic to watch.
These English media is mad it’s cringe 😂😂
15:57 just listen
man City was lucky to have taken the game to extra time. Rodrygo could have finished them off with a hat trick in 3 minutes.
When you rather play against real madrid... Ffs mate don't be so biased in the future Stevie
The best part of this is Kay who started her career working for Real Madrid TV and is a proud Madridista, is having to listen to these fools. Hala Madrid Kay! The smile explains it all
How can u be comfortable in matches like this n also at Benabau
Real Madrid is way bigger than all the teams in PL combined. ✨
ESPN crew don't know football. SMH.
I keep on coming back to laugh at this pundits🤣🤣
HALA MADRID ☆
What bothers me is that these pundits never talked like these during the past 15 years when English teams were getting pummeled by Barcelona and Real Madrid.
Man predicted the final ... haha
lol psg was not dominate the second leg Chelsea was fucked in the first leg n city weren’t dominate in the second leg so I don’t understand this narrative 🤷🏾‍♂️
Yellow Steve ☠️
3 remontadas against 3big clubs some other clubs have remontadas once in a while madrid did 3 times in the biggest european compétition that s royalty hala madrid the greatest club in the world and the kings of europe they are royalty
Kate murray is a madridista i respect her anyways she knows quality
Steve Nicol crying now 🤣🤣 Loserpool lost the finals Real Madrid winners of Champions League 🔥
Being 2 goals up is the worst lead in football
Your experience has been that of an MLS player so of course you will never be able to understand the magic and the pressure playing against Real Madrid in the Champions League at the Santiago Bernabeu. That's why you use those kinds of supernatural terms to describe something you can't possibly understand.
Clown stevie!!! the first logic u should acknowledge is that real madrid has been killing all those team
19:45
10:30 Épico
ESPN- Please hire better pundits and not just British Suckers who believe that English Clubs are the best, when Madrid has knocked 3 top English clubs :) LOL
There's Old Trafford, Anfield, Bridge, Nou, and there's the Santiago Bernabeu.
We silenced the bias english pundits and the noisy english media ☺⚪🔵
Stevie that ball into the box did not look desperate because it's very calculated to reach Benzema for him to get Rodrygo in his fresh leg to get ahead of the keeper. It came out of training ground, this is what people overlook, in desperate time you need precision to get goals and Real Madrid does this best, time and time again
Logic doesn’t work with Real Madrid 🔥
This Madrid , why the no respect
Do you still believe that you should have favoured Madrid to play LFC ?
Props to Carvajal for that sublime Cross to Rodrygo
Thank you steve!!!!
Just go and watch CBS instead of watching this ESPN clowns. Steve Nicole is the biggest clown
Sorry liverpool
RM aka comeback kings
Real Madrid is SPIRITUAL, simple!
Guess what Stevie....It lasted till final and now Madrid are the CH14MPIONS!!!
The remontada effect
Ale Moreno truly understands the power of self-belief
I hope Liverpool can beat this bus parking - counter attacking Madrid team that has been a bit fortuitous.
ESPN got a likes like never before Hala madrid
As a Madrid fan this is the first time I’ve ever been iffy a UCL final. I rather not face Liverpool in the final but all y’all haters gotta admit if we win this will be one of the hardest routes to the final ever.
Only last year joker 2020 was Bayern vs PSG You say as if it's always all English finals Jokes on you
The momentum was on Madrid's side after game one when Madrid answered, 2-0, 2-1, 3-1, 3-2 and 4-3.  Madrid could afford to be patient and they believed they would score.
The guys in specs surely cried whole night after this game 🤣🤣💀
Completely outplayed in 1st leg 🤣. There’s a difference between biased and just being salty and this man showed us what it is.
What are these guys talking about? City were not far superior at all. Neither in the first leg nor in the second. Yes, City likes to keep possession and pass the ball around more than most teams but that alone doesn’t make them better. City conceded 3 goals in each leg. How about that? Im still mad at how they scored their fourth goal in the first leg. Real Madrid were much better in first half of second leg and came very close to scoring but missed each time. Seems these gentlemen missed the first 45 mins. In the beginning of second half too they had their chance but missed again. Anyway, they are out and these ‘pundits’ need to cope.
It’s crazy to think the last 10 years Madrid have spent only 179 million. Not even in the top 20 clubs in spending the last ten years
As nedoum said no hiding place in santiago benabau
BS analysis where these idiots constantly keep saying Real Madrid had nothing until that goal. They may have not been as expressive as ManCity was home but they were a better side overall until that goal by City. It was a tight and tactical match and Real deserved at least one goal. Everything else is the mentality that no team this season has. That’s knowledge and City is not a better than Real. Period!
This 	ali is overacting he wants to work in a movie tell him please stop shouting and acting
Steve is so annoyingly British. Always defending the indefensible. Manchester City SCREWED UP. Period.
6:47 Expected goals: madrid - 2.61 || city - 1.20. The second leg city definitely were not dominant, a false narrative.
Reaction 😂😃😀🤔
To write Real Madrid off,  in CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL, is sooooo naiive!! They will definitely take it.
La 14 YA es nuestra 🙌🏼Hala Madrid!
They got completely outplayed.. yet they scored 6 goals.. I swear.. these pundits..
So frustrating to see this choke job smfh
First the psg the french league champions, later chelsea the last year champions league and now Manchester city the next english prémiele league
PSG Chelsea City And all this according to pundits is luck
Oh boy, that old man Stevie is in for a rude awakening on the 28th, Real Madrid will Stomp Liverpool.
Steve Nicol: "Man City don't deserve to be slaughtered (by the media) like PSG" Me: "PSG conceded three goals by Real Madrid in 17 minutes and Man City conceded three goals in 10 minutes".
Logically, Liverpool should win. But Real Madrid know no logic.
city are bottlejobs
Why do they have to repeat that City controlled the game and was so comfortable, and that Real Madrid was just lucky and this and that blah blah.. I completely disagree. Especially in the game at Bernabeu I felt like Real Madrid (along with the fans) had the momentum in large parts of the game. They created chances and played good football. They only focus on the fact that Madrid had zero on target before the goals, like that tells you all you need to know. I just feel like Madrid is being hated on a little too much maybe?.. What they have done this CL is truly amazing, and I believe something which is very rare in any sport.
The pundits don't seem happy 😭😭 vamos Madrid 💪💪
English analysts are just arrogant and disrespectful against a team that has won more trophies than the whole English Premier league teams together.
This games keep football number one sport in the world.
Liverpool gonna run riot on them just watch
Shall we look at the headlines in truth? "Real Madrid Celebrate Scraping Past a Team of Midfielders!"! When we, finally, cement a replacement for Aguero, with THIS team... Watch out.
This old guy needs to see Madrid beat Liverpool. Will tune in to see what this fool then shits up
It’s hard to believe we beat em 4-0, absolutely insane the mentality of this team
Tired of these so-called analysts bringing up possession and shots on goal as a metric for team dominating. Look at the expected goals. You can score 70 meter shot, and it could be on target but not expect a goal. Those stats are overrated. Nobody talks about a missed tap-in by Vinicius in the first half of the second game, and countless missed chances from Real Madrid in the first game.
premier league best league in the world and real madrid goes through it like a bosssss. Chelsea, city and now Liverpool. Oil League worst league
the fans believed as well... i know i did
I work in a factory in France and this game came up because of course, Karem the Dream 😂 and literally no one had any idea how Man City lost it in under a minute, it's just not possible
Camavinga is my new favourite player, the way he runs with the ball is amazing, his vision, his passes, its all perfect.
Only person that didn't score in the 90th minute was Florentino Pérez.
I don’t think Rodrygo made adjustment mid air, like this talks about, he head the ball expecting to get to him. How it got to him after that deflection; you can call that luck or divine intervention, already written, but not skill or some sort of adjustment. The ball got to him in less than a couple tenths also he is swinging his head almost at the same time as Asensio.
Real Madrid could have won the match sooner if vinijr was a little more experienced.
What reason was there to believe that PSG, Chelsea and City would qualify? Infinite oil financing violating Financial Fair Play? hahahahahaha
Dumb analysis. madrid missed a couple of chances yes not on target , but these gys makes it seem like madrid were like villareal first leg.
Stevie is so smug, can’t wait to see his face in a few weeks time 🤣
Rowan Wiebe is a psychopath who hacks people's facebook accounts including children’s, takes their private messages and photos and reposts them publicly.
What game did this dude watch? Has he been drinking?  The first game they scored away 3 goals plus 3 clear goals opportunities from the 29 to the 50 minutes. LEG 2 They had 2 clear goal chances plus 3 goals? Quit drinking dude
Do not score first against Real Madrid, its a trap, HUGE TRAP!
This arrogant English procl still think real Madrid is fluke  Liverpool will be delivered a perfect footballing lesson in finale
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Donnaruma is responsible for this Madrid run
Ali is spot on city don't know how to play ugly at all ATM just dug their own grave...
Where City the only ones who had chances? Real had chances wasted in the first half, early 2nd half and a half chance by Modric. Had they scored them, would you be talking about Grealish chances? Madrid also played really well at the Etihad and got 3 goals.  Liverpool came back vs Villarreal, English pundits: that's stuff of champions. Real Madrid came back vs Man City, English pundits: Real were lucky, City were better.  Please give Real credits here: they are a great team and have champions mentality.
You people are gonna get what you want Madrid in the final.!!!! Madrid is going destroy Liverpool.!!! Keep on underestimating Madrid.! Liverpool favorites 😂🤣
"machester city is a better team than real madrid"  well, we know that to be untrue now, don't we?
U just can feel (and enjoy) but hurt Stevie
rodrigo benzema courtois benzema 👏👏👏👏
Man City were poor in the second leg, never looked very dominant, didn't create any big chance until the 80th then Grealish made his own luck but could not convert. Controlling the game and the ball is overrated and boring, glad to see City out.
the bald guy has the most annoying accent in the world
Almost £1 billion spent and still not enough to win the CL…
The Madrid-City game for me was more of a life lesson than a football takeaway.   For City, quality and logic aside sometimes in life you need to be ruthless and take your chances and bury your enemy when they are weak.   For Madrid, desire, self belief, determination, matched with charm and know-how goes a long way in getting you over the line especially if you know your history and worth. Simple.
Sunday league football? Seriously?
Real prevented a catastrophe - an all english final
Steve stfu and just admit this team was schooled. English football is overrated o swear
Madrid had some pretty clear chances which they just couldn’t finish. In the 1st half: Benz header, Vini had one and, Modric had a pull back he took a bad touch on. 2nd half opened with essentially a missed 1v1. Madrid created chances and the xG shows that.
I love ale lowkey analyzing..He really understand the football
Benzema Vs Salah   Looking forward to it.
City play good but will never win cuz they are city. Madrid are European royalty, city are peasants. They can't handle these games. They can't handle this competition.
Ale is exactly right. Sometimes you gotta play ugly football to finish a game. Players need to start fouling, clearing the ball out, and wasting time. You are 2 goals up, with 10minutes left, just kill the game. Real Madrid was able to kill the game for 15 minutes in the second half of extra time.  This keeps happening for City, take a look at how they have failed in the CL. They let their guard down, and it comes from this obsession with playing beautiful, controlling football. It's a reflection of Pep's attitude and personality, and he needs to come to terms that football is an uncontrollable sport, there are many moments of chaos.  I think Liverpool is much better at understanding this because they have players that can manage the game. They also understand that managing a result, is much more important than beating your opponent in performance or dominance. They did it against Inter, Benfica, and Villareal, where each of these teams looked like they would come back against Liverpool.  Will this run-in mean that they are the perfect team to face off against Madrid? We'll see come late May.
He said it’s woodoo lol give me a break.
Rumor has it that Gabe is still holding that thought.
Are Liverpool fans nervous?
To be honest, this Real Madrid side is very weakened due to age. On paper, this real side is ranked 6 or 7 after the likes of City, Liverpool, Chelsea, PSG, Bayern, even Barcelona (on paper). However, in terms of never-say-die attitude and personality, they are the best (together with Liverpool). That’s why this personality and attitude helped real to get them out of jail multiple times. Can they do it one more time vs Liverpool? Liverpool can be vulnerable but not as vulnerable as city and PSG.
these guys are too biased fr. I mean I understand that they are british, so there will always be some bias but you should also look at the bigger picture, be objective time to time. You can't just blame the teams that real knocks out each around. Ale saying "dead"!? Fr? Yes, real was struggling to find a way through man city's defense and that's because city is a top club with strong defense but they still had better xGs and the teams were very close but still real was a better side throughout the game. city only started creating really dangerous chances after 70ish minutes after our midfield was tired. that's how the goal came about and the team wasn't that good in those 10-15 minutes but after that they started attacking again. That's the only way. It's not like city just handed the victory to us. They were not bad at all. We got Casemiro back after 1st leg and our defenders performed world-class and vini sent walker back to bench even tho he was really good at neutralizing him in the 1st half. Cancelo wasnt as good at it as walker tho. Rodrygo goals after sub are not new because he did it multiple times before. Camavinga is gonna become the next top midfielder very soon. He is already so good at carrying the ball and contributing to the attacks.
All this disrespect from Englishmen, God I hope Real Madrid will make them shut. I personally would be more afraid from this Madrid team than from City in the final. Madrid is hungry, is a beast who is hungry.
Let's just take a bow to this real madrid team how they have reached final is unbelievable 👏
When Madrid switch to chaos mode they're unstoppable
Steve take the hate out of ur brain against RealMadrid bcz you're just looking like a fool 😂. what a shame to put this fool on espn. Biased fools sitting in the show
am I the only one who hates ale voice or is it just him
Great punditry by Ale Moreno tonight. He is perfectly summing up what we watched in the bernabau. Cos it's true that it was like those Madrid players were possessed by a higher power to stay in that game and even win the game.
tears down my face what a game just when everyone says we are down and out Madrid stands tall only thing missing was good ol Ronaldo and some Zidane Isco disco and that's classic Madrid beautiful game
It’s not possible to explain to you ESPN presenters . You see no futbol . No quality in Real Madrid. you claim unexplained . I see so little from analysis it’s sad .
They can't  stop the Boogey Man, I Love Real Madrid to the end of my Life,  let's go Real Madrid Hasta la final in Paris.
it was all about Vini then it was all about Benzema and now its all about Rodrygo No its about all of them that's what makes Real Madrid who they are its not logical but it was still probable Real doesn't have one world class player in their team...….They have a team who understands each other everyone knows their job regardless of talent level the Midfield is old and aging the defense is Mid AF!!!!! but that front three gets the goals but clearly the defense and midfield is the Leadership of this team everyone knows their strengths and weaknesses the midfield knows they are old and the defense is clearly as leaky as a broken faucet but they are a team which is why when it matters Real always win the matches that matter
Mendy's block 10 seconds before was more incredible than the save. One of the best goal line clearances you will ever see.
The kind of mentality this Real madrid side has and the club as whole is somewhat surprising. They come into the Cl as different breeds all together. This season the number of comebacks Real Madrid made and pep couldn't learn from it is depressing. Its not over  until is over, never write real madrid off. At least Liverpool can learn from that, if they want Cl this season
Crymore you english pundits 😂
No, its all Luck in my opinion. The idea of scoring 3 goals in 5 minutes in a champion league semi finall against possible the best team in the world has nothing to do with determination. Literally everything had to allign for them. They did the same thing to PSG, but at least their we saw it was PSG lack of defense or offense.
Their entire argument was “if this didn’t happen and if that happened”. Well guess what, if Benzema scored that header at 3rd minute and if Vinicius scored his wide open goal chance at the 45 minute of 2nd half we wouldn’t be having this conversation. Then he comments about Camavinga’s throw ball to benzema and compare it to a sunday league sequence, does he remember how city scored their goals? Their first goal was from a cross, their 2nd was from a bad cross and a rookie mistake by Alaba, their 4th goal came after real madrid players froze thinking that it was a foul. If you wanna praise city fine be my guest but do not belittle or slander real madrid on your way because it is just pathetic. Football is played until the final whistle, if real madrid decides to start playing at 90th minute then that’s fine. It is not Real Madrid fault’s that City players shat their pants and crumbled like a cherry cobbler after the 1st goal. They should be thankful that Rodrygo didn’t score his hattrick right after the 2nd goal, Ederson gave them a shot into extra time. Let this be a lesson to entire Europe, DONT YOU EVER WRITE REAL MADRID OFF. APOR LA14.
👎👎👎👎👎👎
Asking a mediocre player who played in the MLS and comes from a country where losing, in everything that has to do with soccer, is the norm what Real Madrid players feel and how mentally tough they are or whether they believe in themselves or not is laughable.
liverpool is a joke for real madrid in final
I really think searching for tactics & logic behind this win is a futile attempt. Sometimes, pure happenstance unfolds & the gods roll the dice.
As Unted fan, I will support and pray for Real Madrid all the waaaaayyy
ngl  after yesterday i started to believe that real madrid was made to champions league even if you spent 100 billion  you cannnot make buy madrid's mentality real madrid beat the most of the richest clubs Man city chelsea psg i wish people had that mentality then people woukld be so developed omg what a mentality to come back from 2 goal deficit   also i regret i was unable watch 2 goals of rodrigo bcz i turned off the TV but i had my notifications on so watched KB9's penalty
Ali is the best analyzer of this panel. Stevie is very overrated & always try to be over smart.
These commentators are the worst, Madrid keeps winning yet every team they beat they say they are better than Madrid. Man city didn’t have control of the game. The only time they did was the first couple minutes of the first game. And then every time they scored Madrid did too. Yes they didn’t have shots on target however they had clear chances all game. Madrid was overall better second game, Spanish football is far superior the style of game, the English commentators don’t like to see it
People need to stop underestimating real madrid. They have good players, they just need to play like it and magic happens. The worst outcomes come when they play too defensive
English pundits hahahah
I think Manchester city is more cursed than real is blessed . Honestly
English national team and players are not as good as you think they are. They are just pumped by media and commercial companies to profit. just look at these semis and euros vs italy. They are overrated and overpriced players
How many times do we have to prove that Madrid is Madrid? Why does everyone keep doubting? Why do everyone count us out and why does everyone thinks is luck?  Why do you people keep thinking that Real Madrid doesn't "deserve" to be where they are? Dude, only British commentators, and pundits think that. The game is not over until is over and what matters is what Henry says all the time on the other network "put the ball on the net" that is all. THE BEST TEAM IS THE ONE THAT WINS! stats don't matter, percentages don't matter, what matters is the result!
Goals win matches. These pundits keep making me chuckle. Everything else is negligent. Possession, chances created, etc, means absolutely nothing.
Everyone doubted Madrid during their three-peat run, and they doubt them now. Man City was never going to win the CL, they always fold, PSG same, Chelsea caught fire at the perfect moment last year. Liverpool will be the biggest challenge. Madrid can't fall behind to them and expect a comeback. My prediction, Madrid 2-2 Liverpool. Madrid wins it on penalties. 💯
Stevie is so salty I love it. Not even a real fan but honestly, how could you think Real Madrid aren’t gonna come back, that’s what they do. He acts like Real wasn’t only 1 down. He must be new to the Champions league cause in the history of me watching, I have never been 100% convinced that just because you win the first leg, doesn’t mean you win the second leg or win it all, especially with Real Madrid. He acts like the first leg was 4-0 and even if it was, Real Madrid was always coming back, it’s just who they are, how can anyone deny that especially a geezer like him
Pep and City don’t know how to win in the knockout phases when it comes down to throwing out the playbook and the game becomes about which team wants it more.
When PSG bottle a 2 goal lead against Real in a half time, English pundits: "PSG oil pastic bottlers they are full of divas with no mental strenght how could they bottle against this bad Real Madrid side?" When Man City bottle a 2 goal lead against Real in 5 minutes, English pundits: "Wow Real are really incredible they managed to come back against fantastic Man City side".
I find it hilarious that these analysts can sit there with a straight face and say that City should not be slaughtered, as they did PSG, for being thrown out of this competition after “dominating” Madrid as they did. City has invested 1.3 billion Euros to win the UCL, and they couldn’t kill the game because it’s beneath Pep to defend well. City dominate three out of 4 moments of the game: attack, and both moments of transition are quite brilliant, but he doesn’t give the same attention to knowing how to sit in and kill the game.
The way he says RRReal Ma'RRi is so grating....it's like pronouncing Liverpool in an English accent while speaking in Spain on Spanish TV. Crazy. Just call them Real, or Madrid, or even better Real Madrid when you're on an English-speaking channel!
Foden is a very fine player but the hype is way out in front of him.
Ale is a moron. City did get ugly against Athletico. He is a clichés machine . Please get rid of him.
Yes, Man city is a better team than Real Madrid. Yes, they should have won. But… Real Madrid aren’t the plucky underdog that they’ve been portrayed as this knockout stage. They’re still Real friggin Madrid.  They have amazing players at every position, that if given the chance, will capitalize on any opportunity.  That’s the point that everyone keeps missing.
Stevie right City threw it. Laporte on first didn't read cut back either.
Why do these average ex-players turned self proclaimed football pundits not understand what winning 13 UCL titles mean to a socio-owned club. Defeating these oil money teams happens because you just cannot throw money at players and expect them to be loyal for the club. After 90 minutes of such an intense game, it's the sheer determination and will of players that drives them. No amount of coaching, can make a player dedicated to the club. Real Madrid players clearly suffered, played, died and then resurrected for their badge, while Manchester City players looked like there was no dedication or love for the badge.
Walker was run into the ground by Vinni. There were some sneaky fouls on Vinni.
ESPN Hosts talking like Real Madrid is a nobody as usual 😭😭 Also stats don’t show everything clearly. They had decent chances on goal and maybe 1 or 2 on target. And it’s definitely not luck when it keeps happening and no one is able to stop them so far. Respect the only team in history with 13 cups
so how tall is rodrygo, in what position does he plays and where the goals were scored? that the answer for the question
Don’t ever compare that fraud Pep with Klopp again, I guess Fraudiola was a genius substituting DeBruyne in a semifinal 😂 Congrats Real Madrid, wanted you guys in the final, we can now play against a team with real history and pedigree. City rent boys enjoy watching on tv, you aint on this level with your suga daddy money
You were one of the people who slaughtered PSG team just like PSG aweful fans. Real classless.
Man city fans are decent fans,,,unlike the PSG bottom feeder fans who rubbished their team because they lost to Real. City has missed out in CL a lot after spending millions yet their fans were not as "slimy as PSG fans. Class is class and horse is horse!
ARE YALL SERIOUSLY IGNORING THE FACT THAT CASEMIRO SHOULDVE BEEN SENT OFF WITH ALL THOSE FOULS. It would’ve been a different game… TALK ABOUT THAT!!!! Refs always favor Madrid
Steve Nicol showing again that he in fact is either clueless or just did not watch the game. Real Madrid had multiple chances to score in the 1st half and got really good chances but missed, no shots on target doesnt mean they didnt threaten. Pep himself said City was lost in the 1st half. Insane that someone like him is paid to talk about games and run narratives.
I always say don’t sleep on Madrid in the champions league they own that league 🔥🔥 A match ain’t finish until the final whistle is blown  HallaaaAmadRIDD🔥
its about mentality
I don't know what game you guys watched. Real madrid weren't destroyed so substantially where they produced nothing. That is just crazy talk.
So you people will keep talking about the other team being better while we all watch Real Madrid win 14th UCL 🤣
How is that Ale guy on this show?? Not very good
This is not the same liverpool team that Madrid managed to beat last year 3-1?
Im tired of these tiki taka merchants that thinks that passing the ball around without finishing scoring is equall to dominance in a game, the game is far beyond that. You need to defend, create chances, and finish those chances, thats what real madrid does, in this game Man city didnt dominate like the first game. This game was equally the whole game, vini missed sitters and benzema too
U barely beat athletio 1-0 in 2 games of real Madrid gonna Hummer you they scored 6 goals in 2 games against the best fake team 😭😂😭😂
Hahahaha English toys 😭😂😭😂 we will have to wait another 50 years for English yussies to catch up . Oil money no oil money u will get hummered by you big poppa
The idea that city controlled the game in the first 90 mins is the type of fan fiction that you can only expect from English commentators. That was a very even game for the most part. Both sides held possession. Both sides created good chances whether on target or not. Quite frankly, the attackers on both sides were pretty mediocre in the first 90. They keep talking about what if Grealish scored one of those two chances, but what if Benz and Vini hadn't bottled their chances with a poor first touch. Gimme a break
city has the worst luck of every team in the champions league
Why is no one mentioning the referee's performance in extra time. It's as though the cheque cleared in the first minute of extra time.
Alejandro needs to Americanize his pronunciation of Spanish names when he speaks English. It's really jarring to hear an American accent followed by a perfectly pronounced (in Spanish) Santiago Bernabéu and  "RRRRReal Madrid".
Sport commentators should not be public announcing that go for a certain team because then there opinions sounds bias.
Can you talk about how Dias wasn’t sent off for slapping Modric across the face? I’ve never seen something like that not called a red before. Bizzare
how did casemiro not get a yellow for a terrible tackle,(then gets a yellow card ten minutes later) but sterling got a yellow for nothing
Steve Nicol must be the most hypocritical pundit around (hear him when PSG/Barcelona does the same). Moreno makes more sense.
How Casemiro stayed on the field is beyond me. Two *clear* yellow card fouls, and then in the second half you’d think he’d at least get a persistent infringement yellow for his foul at the top of the box, but still no. I really don’t understand it. But, the deserved team won, Man City do not have the mentality for this competition
After that penalty goal from Benzema, Pep knew it was over for City, you could just see it in his body language.  All these British pundits keep coming with excuses like "Oh City had a bad day"" etc. The truth is, Real Madrid gave them a bad day. City don't really have a strong very strong rival besides Liverpool in the Premier League and the Atletico Madrid match proved that.  Besides, Casemiro was back and he made De Bruyne's life very difficult.The turning point of the game were definitely the subs made by Ancelotti and those two moments with Cortouis' toe save against Grealish and Mendy's goal line clearance.
Everyone talk about Real Madrid  Yesterday talk Madrid can’t win without cr7
City needs a fking proper stiker lol 🤣🤣😅😂😂😂
Ederson fucked it for the 1st goal which cost MCI the tie. Love to see it.
all of these pundits were saying oh Man City this etc. Only us true fans still believed as we were witnesses for la decima. More than the win, I love how foolish they all look which is why when I hear them saying stupid things about Ronaldo, I know it's due to their own insecurities. Hala Madrid!
Far superior 🤨. Madrid had 3 4 chances in the 90 as well. I thought the game at the Bernabéu was pretty even
Madrid don't get to play the final in the Bernabeu. Their luck ends here.
LOSER MAN CITY HAHAHAHHA ESPN PUNDITS ARE SO SAD THAT ITS NOT AN EPL FINAL
for analysis on la liga or latin America related topics, you just need to listen to Ale. Ale is pretty clueless on EPL though
The guy, saying Real Madrid is easier, because of logic. Showing his british bias. Real Madrid in the Champions League is a different beast. On paper sure you can make the case for Liverpool being having the better individual players, but Real Madrid is a better “team” there is something about them, and they define “never give up, its not over till its over”. We are going to have a great final, and “logic” tells me that Liverpool still have a Premier League title run to make, while Real Madrid now only has to cruise control thru La Liga and prepare this final.
kyle walker getting injured changed the outcome of this game...
This bald guy mad hates Madrid . I’m glad Madrid won. This dude always says Real Madrid plays bad
Allahu Akbar Alhamdulillah
I don’t agree that there was no momentum with Real before the 90th mins, Real actually had chances throughout the game, 0 shot on goal was because the shots went wide, but they were close. And of course City had plenty of chances
How do these guys have a spot on these chairs, every show I'm baffled about the way they miss every point and nuance in the game.
I very much dislike most English pundits. Bias and bias every single thing out of their mouth is overhyping English sides and downplaying the success of outside clubs. It’s ridiculous the way they justify matches to fit their narrative. Time and time again it never fails
Nobody seems to mention that alaba was missing. If only it as dias or van dijk, OMG.
City were made to sweat by Atletico - Europe's most defensive team - in the previous round yet the Anglophile pundits continue to present them as some sort of continental superpower. CL is not the PL. If you can't keep your composure against Atletico you're always likely to concede against Real who are the ultimate survivors.
I usually agree some of Stevie’s takes, but not today. He blasted PSG for bottling their KO Round against Madrid, even predicted it. City have a history of doing the exact same thing in this competition; actually worst - getting knocked out by Lyon recently. Stevie gives credit to City for leading from the 2 minute to 180 minute - and still losing. But before that, he blasted PSG for practically doing the same thing.   I’m starting to wonder if there’s a little English media bias here. I’m thinking they wouldn’t be as critical of PSG if they played in the Premier League, or if they’d destroy City if they played in Ligue 1.
Always when camavinga is on the pitch, he’s such an amazing player, bargain.  As an arsenal fan I can only dream about him in the left CM role. We should’ve just gone all out
Man, Ale is so cringe
Who needs mbapppe and penaldo anyway
Man City lost the game they concede too many goals its good scoring lots of goals but if you can't defend you will never be the best in the world.
If it wasn't for those two doubtful penalties, man city would be in the final
Its called mentality, determination, sacrification, team spirit & the belief in yourself. No football god has anything to do with that. Envious, jealous and biased brits as usual. Get on our level. Hala Madrid!!
Pep made those substitution like he was winning 5-0 in fa Cup
Who hired these analysts haha!?
They forgot about what if Vini scored that open goal opportunity… every team makes mistakes… you have to scored those opportunities.
What is the prem bias LMAO. Real Madrid dominated the 1st half. Even Pep said it in the post match interview. Start of the 2nd half had a huge chance aswell. Real Madrid were the better team until City scored. And these clowns saying City was clear and no one thought Madrid would come back. Even the danish commentators were saying the next goal is going to be a Madrid goal the whole game until City scored
Immortal real whites
Real Madrid’s playing style is winning. Simple as that. Difficult to prepare against that. Pep looked lost in extra time. Non of his phenomenal tactics were going to work at that stage.   Madrid has a winning mentality. Pundits choose to call it luck because they do not understand. This is beyond tactics.
What by cheating?
I call it “Club DNA”. Some clubs just have it in their DNA to historically be successful.
Completely agree with Moreno about City not knowing when it's time to stop being City and start holding on to what they have.
There have been many remontadas by Real Madrid, but sticking to the Champions League, one significant example is the final against Atletico Madrid final 2014.  Ramos scored a header in the last dying seconds of the game - 93'.  Real went to win 4-1 extra time.  The game was not at the Bernabue.  Don Carlo was the manager :) Saying that this is pure luck it is an offence to football in general, not just to Real Madrid.  This is part of the DNA of the club, that survived the time and it is becoming even stronger as years goes by.  Many remontadas even during the league, including this year.  Fergie time - anyone remembers?  Was it luck? No - it was of Fergie DNA, that he managed to instill in the team during his tenure.  Unfortunately it has died when he retired.     This is unique identity is what makes a team different / better than others.
Send Jack Grealish back and get a real striker. Pathetic
gotta go with liverpool to win, its a one leg final, in a neutral stadium. No Bernabeau to help out the Madridistas this time
One is a team with glorious CL history, the other a soul-less team with the number of fans equal to a neighborhood of madrid… eventually history comes out
1 minute silence for espn pundits for favouring city😌
16:00 to 17:00 is the best analysis of the MCFC brain-freeze.
I heard that god is with real madrid
Craig Burley, where have u run to now? XD
These guys and their analysis are pro English clubs and EPL, and continues to disrespect Real Madrid. Ale is the only exception who is objective in his analysis. Stevy appears the worst of them. He's emotional and pained here.  Stev says Real didn't get a shot on target (stats), now that's the problem. Stats don't tell the story of a game, you need to watch to know what happened and be objective and less emotional to analyse. Pep himself conceded that Man City were inferior in the first half; Madrid blazed few of there chances over. Vini. missed a sitter early in the 2nd half. Yet, Stev only remembers Grealish's two chances. He went ahead to say Madrid's goals weren't pretty because they didn't cut Madrid open.  Secondly, Stev slaughtered PSG for loosing vs Real, but not City. Why? They both lost in similar fashion - 2 goals up. In fact, City's was worst: just a minute to go. He's thrown 2 EPl clubs to Real Madrid, all got beaten. I know he'll still say Liverpool is much much better and will win Madrid.  Madrid are happy to be underdogs.
As a Reds fan I will be filling my pantaloons if Bale comes off the bench second half. Strong tip.
The most embarrassing punditry! did i hear Steve Nicol saying what Real Madrid did is something you can't explain? Does he know in football to dominate is not to win and a game is not over until the referee blows the whistle?
I just feel bad to see that whenever Real Madrid have done such amazing feats these football pundits (one of whom is a great 3 time MLS champion) are so quick to point out that it was the opponents who played bad and they were at fault for losing. According to them Real Madrid didn't even deserved to qualify for the final. Don't know about them but I certainly watched the game and RM created several chances in this leg but yeah there finishing was poor. But how is this justified, criticizing PSG, criticizing Chelsea and now criticizing City. In la liga they criticizing Barcelona and Atleti, why tf are these Tiki Taka fan boys so hesitant to accept that yeah Real Madrid played well and deservedly defeated one of the best teams in football right now.
Meanwhile Man City are still waiting to drop that all of Nothing Man City Documentary. But they always lose in champions league 😂
I actually think it's more about City's weak mentality over the years than Madrid's Mentality this time around. These guys have chocked so many times to lesser teams. Why should Madrid be any different?
LOL, the BIAS is unreal. Nedum says City were in control, they just had to see the game out and then concludes by saying: Foden had a poor game, Mahrez was quiet only got the goal, Jesus was quiet, De Bruyne had an off night. the pundits all say  Dias and Laporte were poor and at fault for 5 of the goals. OKAY GREAT, SO EXPLAIN TO ME HOW A TEAM THAT CONCEDES 6 GOALS!!!!! DESERVED ANYTHING? some times just give credit when due and show teams respect to teams in other leagues. Think its Time to unsubscribe
Hats off to Real Madrid from a City fan
Stevie was robbed of beating city in the final (Liverpool) 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Madrid didn't do anything for 90 mins?  They stayed in the game. They gave themselves a chance to comeback. Waiting for the 70 minute mark when he (Ancelotti) would introduce Rodrygo and Camavinga as usual.
And the dude with glasses has no freaking clue, "I rather play vs Real Madrid in the final as Liverpool". Real Madrid has 13 trophies, the record is 13/16 I think. I rather play against Real Madrid, really? You know nothing about football, mate!
The bold guy is spot on, except for one thing, which is the folly of Pep's teams by the way. If Real Madrid shoots 4 times on target and makes 3 goals in each of the games, then they don't have to do much else, do they? And if Manchester City shoots 20 times and miss 15 of them, that's not bad luck, that's they suck at attacking (as well as defending), and that's the reality of it, ball possession means nothing, it is what you do with it that ultimately counts. Manchester City had great midfielders thou.
Si en la final hace el partido de su vida, el Balón de Oro será para Karim Benzemá.
Steve is lost in 1960
They're still taking RM lightly, even though I'm a Liverpool supporter I kinda feel like RM should win just to shut up these so-called experts! At the end of the day it's about goal and nerve, doesn't matter how.
No true praise for Real Madrid, so disrespectful really. If you thinking that they are not a great side you just overlooking the reality.
PLEASE REMOVE THE VENEZULAN GUY, HE DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL.
Steve shut up your mouth football is not how you feel or think it is all about what happens  on the field . You guys don't know football that is why you think Liverpool is the favorite . Real Madrid will win Liverpool I am sure 100% that real Madrid will win Liverpool I will put my money on real Madrid
I CAN AGREE MAN CITY IN THE FIRST LEG WAS A FAR BETTER SIDE BUT IN THE SECOND LEG ITS A DIFFERENT CASE.... BEFORE THE CITY GOAL THE ONLY ONE SIDE WHO HAD THE BEST CHANCE WAS REAL MADRID WITH THAT OPEN GOAL MISS FROM VINI JUNIOR SO ...REAL MADRID COULD HAD EASILY SCORED THERE AND WE WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT COVERSATION NOW
Pep is SOOO overated. He hasn't one a UCL since Barca!!!  While spending more than a billion dollars.
anther magical night to real madrid
Wrong guy to start the punditry. Moving on.
when Mahrez scored i was like no way this incredible semis can end in so boring way without any drama.. And BOOMMM!!! Madrid actually created all the drama and went through..Crazy stuff 😂🤯
How long are we going to pretend that Guardiola can win Champions League without a good defensive system? Klopp is the best manager in the world, he knows how to play attractive attacking, balanced, beautiful and defensive football all at the same time.
They’re such haters
You'll always sing that....!!!! You'll always sing thaaaaaaaat!!!  Bottlers of Europe you'll always sing that!!!  💰💴 ⛔️ 🏆    💪 ⚽️ = 🏆
💰💴 ⛔️ 🏆    💪 ⚽️ = 🏆
Lol Stevie PL bias is crazy.. does Man City deserve to be slaughtered like PSG were? YES! There’s literally no difference to Man City and PSG this year
Remontada Mode
Is steve Nicoll serious, liverpool would prefer to play city cause pep is a choker in finals. Real madrid only slightly inferior squad liverpool, only cause real madrid have lots of young players who are not in there prime, i think unfortunately for liverpool they will not win this final and man city will win the league, they whont get the 4 trophys.
iooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooi
Youre all brainwashed by epl get out of that bubble anyone who has been watching madrid for years knew they were advancing i was never nervous about it you all should be fired its clear you all only watch epl
You guys bet against Real Madrid because you guys forgot that the goals scored was a result of terrible mistakes by Madrid in the first leg. Real was able to score 3 difficult goals in the first game. Goals win matches. Not beautiful play. Real has more efficiency than any other team with regards to scoring and that's why they are in the final.
Self-confident.
You should all be fired
Why doesn’t Ancelotti get his props
The mistake Man City made was allowing 3 goals at home, not the game last night. The door was always open for RM.
I hope Liverpool smash them. They're a decent team but not worthy of being champions league winners. Hope Liverpool turn up
Man City fans angry about no red card for Casemiro and the soft penalty: don't forget the game against Arsenal. Arsenal were not given a penalty and Rodri who scored the winning goal should have already gotten a red card before that but hadn't even gotten a yellow. Those 2 points could give you the Premier League title. So don't complain about refereeing in this semi if you win the PL by 1 point. 👋
To the guy with the grey suit:  Mardid missed two sitters before Man City goal, so don't say that Madrid did nothing in 90 minutes.
Maybe you don't need to criticize the opponents Real Madrid play. Appreciate Real Madrid!! Hala Madrid!!!
Stevie is so salty against real Madrid it's crazy. they have proved haters like him wrong tie and time again, yet he continues to belittle their achievements.
Ale is the only 1 who gets it.
It's pretty interesting that PSG arguably had the best chance to beat RM with the pace from mbappe who tore that backline apart and they truly did give RM no chances until donarrumma was fouled. In a parallel universe he passed the ball and RM are out of the UCL but that moment ignited their knockout run
Why shouldn't they be slaughtered?.... Liverpool boy is to emotional. City should be blamed for not covering there tracks in the last minutes of the 90.... and conceding another goal withing secs....they watched psg and Chelsea before coming for the match and should understand that they needed to keep a cool head after conceding
Mentality over everything. This real Madrid team is full of proven winners with loads of experience, as a Barcelona fan I can only be jealous of their fighting spirit and determination
I think that Kyle Walker coming out injured was THE game changer. I think he would've been there for the first goal, and definitely a presence in the box for the second Madrid goal. Vini was quiet the whole time he was there and Madrid had an extra lane when he went out
Real will beat liverpool  very comfortably   wait and see
Biases at their best..how can the better team be defeated???? You keep saying real Madrid played against better teams PSG, Chelsea and Man City yet still you stating the fact that they were dismissed by the "lesser team" real  Madrid!! Disrespectful brits! Fact is tactics prevail...stop talking bs about football gods and luck. This is nothing lucky just pure grittttttt never give up attitude!
well a football miracle happened and real Madrid won.. the football gods been looking out for them since the round of 16.. well deserved 👏 🙌.  now liverpool awaits for revenge 😂😂😂.
dont bet against real madrid.. bcoz we are the kings of champions leagues..history tell that clearly..hala madrid❤❤
City are just bottle jobs
In case these pundits forget about stats, RM has faced Liverpool 5 times since 2007. Winning 4 and drawing 1 i.e. 80% win rate against Liverpool.  Secondly Ancelotti has a 75% finals win rate, winning 3/4 finals he's been to. Klopp has a 33% finals win rate, winning 1/3 finals he's been to.... The numbers don't support Liverpool winning. Liverpool will have possession and chances but RM will win this game By a comfortable score line like in 2018
Rodrygo, Camavinga, Vini, Militao, and Valverde are all filling their shoes. We may be on the verge of the new era of  Galactico’s
Did these guys watch the match or they just read the update
We should appreciate Ancelotti for the way he made changes, special appreciation to the Brazilian Rodrigo , he reads the game from the bench comes & gives good passes takes good positions & finishes with precision,.
Pep should manage PSG. He'd fit in well there
Its official, Ancelotti is Emperor Palpatine
Why the videos are not in 4K ?
City only had to defend 2 goal lead for 6 mins but they bottled it big
Feels so dam good to beat them to shut all this England Media all they been doing is hating and talking about what we can’t do and now they running out of excuses to make for our success nonetheless on to Liverpool!!!
ESPN pundits they watched different games
ESPN. Where's the discussion about Man city as being total flops? On par with PSG.
from the 1st leg results...this is no surprise that RM came back in this match...man city is purely an attacking force...their defense is quite poor...the back line never answers any questions with any convictions...RM does not have the best team compared to their past....but they are using their experience to advance ...
Again stevie is representing the arrogance of English teams without giving respect to the other team.
You can just sense the sadness in some of these peoples voices😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I am Real Madrid fan and I am very happy but Casemiro should have been booked and some city players weren’t booked either
City choking...is inevitable 😁
Time and again, year after year. It feels so good to come back to see disappointment on the faces of ESPN pundits whenever Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo overcome odds to beat their preferred teams. Happiness.
Guardiola is an overrated tactician who the idiotic espn pundits are groupies of.
Nah if you know football. Madrid is never out. City needed to not let them score at all and have a 2-0 lead to have them dead. Never count them out and I’m a Atleti fan. Just happy for Real, they have worked hard and deserve it. Pep needs a wake up call hard what else does he really need
Steve Nicol is such a hater, feels like my ears are bleeding everytime I hear him speak
ESPN FCB jinx is real...
All games are Unique. Like it or not but you can play or watch 1 Billion games for example & none of them will ever be the same & that will never change. That's some pure Savage logic for you. That's why I love football. It's an Unique game that will always surprise you. Champions League without the away goal rule was just pure genius in my opinion. [ Form is temporary. Class is permanent & Real Madrid for sure have class. ]
Makes me wana puke 🤮 when these stupid pundit disrespect real madrid
Liverpool fans believed Real would beat City. It’s destiny to annihilate Real in the final. Payback time 🥳
Stevie Madrid had better chances than City in the game. Shots on target says nothing about how the game went you nitwit
Even if you say this is the weaker squad, shouldn’t you give them more respect for their determination and mentality. Knowing when to push for the win even if they are faced with tough opponents and they were faced with the toughest opponents on their road to the final. When Leicester won the premier league all I heard was praise because they pushed against all the odds. I know Madrid is not Leicester as they are European kings but this squad has pushed through all the odds and showed heart by veterans and youngsters alike and deserve all the praise instead of dismissal and hate that I see from pundits especially and some football fans. I remember at the beginning of the season people were saying Spanish football was done with the condition that Barca and Madrid were in. Hala Madrid, Por la 14 los Reyes Blancos. Wether we win or lose the final will be an exciting game between my favorite team overall and my favorite team in England. Proud to watch this Madrid squad and excited for next season when we add more depth with Mpabbe, Rudiger, and hopefully a couple more.
I just cant believe that none of these guys got any thought to put Real Madrid as a consideration to win against City.
Who is this guy talking? What a tool.. Speaks in an American accent and then becomes Speedy Gonzalez every time he says Real Madrid
Everybody says the same thing that we couldn’t see it coming, it was comfortable for City, was i watching a different game? I thought in the first half Real Madrid put City under immense pressure, creating chances, winning the ball high up the pitch and moving the ball well in possession. I don’t think I remember the last time I seen Man City being dominated by a team as they were in the first half. Then Real Madrid started the second half by almost scoring in the first minute. Then there was a period where City got hold of the ball, slowed the game down and kept possession of the ball. This was the most boring period of the game and the most worrisome period from Madrid’s perspective. And I think this was the period where Man City scored the goal. But I must say that Madrid were by far the better team, perhaps not reflected on the number of chances created but they were much better than City.
Steve will defend any English team even when they lose vs a "lesser" side 😂😂 you talking about Real Madrid here not some chumps
😭patience kills
I wont say madrid did the unthinkable but more the other way around … city did the unthinkable bybtrying to play pretty all the time..if they shut the door and park the bus..madrid would not be able to return from the grave
I hope Madrid gets CR7 and James back with ancelotti. Throw Bale back on the right wing and witness 2013-2014 Real again.. iconic moment.
What madrid did defies logic
They didn't do anything in 90minute!!? Seriously. Vini missed a easy chance same to Benzema
Am happy city disappointed ESPN  Now they will be saying Liverpool will finish the work as they said against PSG, CHELSEA AND CITY   Let's watch and see
these guys didnt watch the game, vini missed 3 or 4 chances and modric missed in front of goal aswell
City was better, Chealsea was better, Paris Saint Germain was better but Real Madrid have something else
they had them out because english pundits are clowns
I remember when Odense beat Real Madrid at the "magical" Bernabeu. We will see how amazing this bunch of old Madrilenos fare against LFC. Maybe they can dig up el generalissimo one last time? At least they know where to find his corpse
Lol your ESPN pundits are the stupidest thinking that city were going right there. Specially ally Moreno he’s the worst of the bunch please get rid of him
Man City should just buy Harry Maguire the goat to solve their "defensive problems".
Man City is falling victim to the stubbornness of Pep Guardiola. The man needs to buy a world class striker. That's all there is to it. His obsession with playing false nines is his downfall at the highest level. Other teams have DEADLY strikers that take opportunities. Depending on Gabriel Jesus is criminal when you have the resources Man City does.
Real didn't border when PSG, Chelsea, & Especially City led & controlled d game bcoz Real will eventually win
Pep is still the best. He is a genius , an artist, cause he loses so tragically quite often.  Man City had also bad luck. But soon they will win the premier legue for the third time in 4 years.
Shouldn’t have a biased analyst.
" Reeeeal madriiiii"
Real only have the champions league to focus on from now Liverpool still have the fa cup and the prem.
You can't even put blame on pepe these high paid players let themselves down in throwing away a 2 led game in last 6 minutes gralish should have been running his socks of they should have kept ball up at all cost
Liverpool are really not the favorite in the final. It's a 50-50 with the momentum being with real madrid
Alejandro likes saying Real Madrid 😂
This guy called it. Discount Real Madrid at your own peril.
Bla bla bla ... Football in Spain is better than Premier league. There is another proof
City can never be considered a big club without that Champions league.
Hala Madrid!!! Came here to see what our friends 😉 are going to say after virtually discounting any chance of a Madrid victory. 🤣🤣🤣
Real got better shaman
I donot understand this PANEL at all, like first half was 50-50 right, then again if you check, the shots on target is NOT CORRECT, there were chances, no one is talking about POOR TOUCHES from either side specially at the front  like Vini and from man city, this time defence was organized, no one is talking about it. 21 minutes this "PRO ANALYSIS" has gone, and panel has to say VOODOO? r u fkn kidding me? Like you are a PANEL be neutral, COME ON MAN! no one is talking about Rodrygo what a HEADER, no one talking about acutally SCORING PENALTY, benzema was under presusure. HECK, NO ONE TALKED ABOUT THE CITY GOAL, utter couter attacking brolliance!! LIKE ENGLISH PEOPLE ARE SO FKN PROUD they can praise anyone else? WHAT IS THIS PANEL?
Real Madrid 3 - Premier League 0 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Real Madrid- Chelsea 1-0 Real Madrid- Manchester city 2-0 Real Madrid-Liverpool 3:0 100%
Too bad they are loosing the final
Luck is an important aspect of winning the champions league. Mind you forget Chelsea in 2012, this is no different. It seems Madrid have all the luck.
From nothing? Maybe because you can never see it when it is coming against Man City and Pep. When everyone predicted a Man City win, I KNEW Real could somehow do it. ESPN has football romantics. They want so bad for Pep playing that football, beautiful football, to win it so they can say football won.
Now this is called Game of Coaches.
Suck off real Madrid for days will this bunch . I have nothing to not believe that Manchester city has not sold this game
ESPN FC clowns were all writing RM off. Silly mistake, I bet they'll write them off for the final as well.
Acc to these pundits Real madrid has'nt been favourites to win cl since 2014. Look at this now.
They said it was patience and with patience you need composure and persistence do these people not see that they caught man city lacking they got to comfortable and that's how Real Madrid was able to overtake those last mins making them think they were finished amazing game man city was amazing but in the end Real was better
"If there's time on the clock, it ain't over." - Mr. 92:48, El Capitano. This is our DNA. Others wither under pressure, we thrive on it.. We crave it. This is Real Madrid, Reyes De Europa! 👑  Hala Madrid y Nada Mas!
Let's just say Madrid built different.
Is he okay at the start? 😂 Dead... Deaddddd. dead DEAD.
The football god do not want the big ears to be stained by oil
Madrid shot on target numbers despite how good the chances they had is insane. But man rodyrgo break the spell
We can talk about Real Madrid but Man City need new players and Zidane maybe.
I still believed
Hahaha this English pundits and experts are funny lol. I remembered they once said real Madrid luck cannot work with city. All were predicting man City well win, only Gab who said never underrated Madrid. They all feel frustrated and now they using escuses.
Why does Marcotti have green hair?? haha
I keep saying time an time again 90 mins in the bernabeu is very long never right off madrid is city fault they fell asleep they taught the 1 goal was enough i mean if mendy didnt save that goal on the line it would of been a different story but this madrid team has the passion an love for the game they never give up they know there the under dogs but we keep shotting the critics mouths time an time again
Daisey Grealish over the last 10 years averaged 3 goals a season, man city got ripped off 90 million, blind to see why you would pay that much for a championship league player
Englishmen no longer count as experts.
Its amazing how American networks have the best football pundits right now. You got Mr Moreno & his team here on ESPN then on CBS you got Henry & his team.
I fully blame guardeola
Pep should stop wearing that turtle neck shirt in important knockout matches.
I love Real Madrid
Real Madrid are the type of  team you have to kill, cut their heads off and bury ten meter under the ground but after all Manchester City failed to do so. They left us to breathe a little and they paid the price.. HALA MADRID Y NADA MAS
It's not just final , it will be the battle of Ballon d'or either Benzema or Mane.
All these people who are happy to have real Madrid against Liverpool. They will be crying on 28th. Wishing it was city instead 😂
These guys don't really have a clue, just always backing Man City for years. Chelsea and PSG were so good and missed so many chances. Man City didn't have clear chances at all in the game
The guy in the middle is so rude and aggressive maybe the age hhhh
It will continue -  Pep can't win without Messi.
"Real Madrid's equalizer is something Sunday League team would do". For love of god, get this man off from the pundit's team, I'm not sure if it's because he's old or he's trolling.
Hala Madrid, you will learn to never ever write us off.
That expected goals calculation doesn't make any sense
This is why Ronaldo and Real Madrid were the perfect romance, the confidence, the mentality and the sheer force of will is what defines them.
Another bottle job by Pep Fraudiola
For a team that defines themselves by control, City were strangely unable to control this match when they were in the ascendancy on multiple occasions. I would say their 'game management' was exceptionally poor. No fewer than four times across the two ties they were two goals ahead. To give up such a lead so many times is really unacceptable at this level.  You can and have to give credit to Madrid, but their goals didn't come from sustained pressure in pretty much any of those instances. They were moments that resulted partly from the game being unnecessarily open. City needed to kill the game, *especially* with 5 minutes to go. Small decisions were poor, for example Cancelo lofting a cross straight into Courtois's arms from deep to gift back possession shortly before the 90 minute mark yesterday.  There's a psychological frailty to this team, that for all the brilliance reflects poorly on Pep. I personally think it's a result of their model. They are so coached, so drilled, and it's the basis of their strength. It also has a major downside though, which is that it slightly minimises the personality and agency of the players themselves, and when the plan doesn't work, they look lost. He's still a great manager, and they're a great team, but they seem fatally flawed in the key moments that this competition tends to throw up.
Nedoum salamarize everything happens in the match well said you are unbiased pundit
Seems that curse on Guardiola by Yaya Toure's agent is really working on him
Gab is too negative when Liverpool is mentioned in a conversation. The hatred is too much. Just admit they are a good side now🤣✌️🙏
City has no excuse... When you watch the Barcelona of Guardiola in the champions league, you would understand how Messi was so special for the Barcelona team. Without him, you can see clearly that Guardiola just missed the genius of Messi
Are we going to talk about how penalty was decided..??? I think it was too harsh to be taken at the spot without considering the VAR.
The second leg of both semis proved that football is more about determination than tactics
Opponent has to score unless Real won't turn on  So klopp has to be smart he should not score until 88/90 minutes
The Madrid-City game for me was more of a life lesson than a football takeaway.   For City, quality and logic aside sometimes in life you need to be ruthless and take your chances and bury your enemy when they are weak.   For Madrid, desire, self belief, determination, matched with charm and know-how goes a long way in getting you over the line especially if you know your history and worth. Simple.
Ale should have ask Steve how long city are going to commit same mistake, sin he said madrid always take advantage of opponents mistake
the amount of disrespect given to RM
All that oil money went in vain once again…btw man city players look like robots when they play
Should be a great final  two teams that never know when they’re beaten
This guy should not be a pundit you speak about "logic" in football ah
I watched the game as a neutral. But i believed that Real Madrid would win. One should not bet against Madrid in a CL match
Congratulations in advance to Madrid for winning with 14th UCL. No Spanish teams have ever lost a European finals to a non Spanish teams.
If you have 3 Englishmen in your attack, you have already lost the game. No Englishmen have even scored an UCL final winning goals ever. Foden Greelish Sterling 😂😂😂
Oil money from human rights abusers couldn't buy City a CL. plastic scums.
Pep Saudioila's billion petrodollar team washed down the drain. Still, not as bad as the other sad Manchester club.
Poor Gab never got a chance to speak 😭😭
What was guardiola doing substituting mahrez and de Bruyne. Once again pep has cost city in the champions league
Real Madrid is real !
Crew can't digest the fact that it isn't an all english final 🤣🤣
Just cry babies espnfc
I’m still going for Liverpool 😂
Nothing to say😮Just call it a miracle
since 2015 city spent almost 1 billion dollars and still did not win any UCL.... woow...
Wow pundits and its best . Only stevie making half sense . Gab talking about gk save and mendey clearance but he forget how many chances Vinicius miss ? real madrid looked like team who want to score city just want to defend with ball and when they loss possession they defend with 0-5-5 you can see in highlights . Pep wanted to play counter attacking and they tried but failed .despite when other play counter attacking pep criticise them openly . None pundits have guts to criticise pep coz start of season they made him god of football otherwise after leaving barca he choose elite teams with lots of money but failed to win CL with both teams but no one will criticise him . His subs were awful accept ilkay he made Fernandinho sub which is defensive after that Madrid have  easy possession of ball but no pundit will mention it. if mourinho make defensive sub and game will draw then this people will kill him in press . But its pep so everything is acceptable
Hilarious how these guys fail to give any credit to the squad and the manager despite thing through the three ties
This is such a biased panel towards English teams, especially this Nicol guy, he blames two brilliant goals scored by Madrid, down by 2 goals in last few minutes of CL SF, to city's defensive mistakes! Bro, you need to understand football better, if Man City was so good then why couldn't the come back from 5 all with 30 minutes to go, when Madrid came back from 3-5 down with 5 mins to go. And I wonder if you even saw the game, no shots on target you say? Benzema and Vinicius had very good chances that they fluffed, they took much difficult chances at Etihad, MC is lucky Benzema wasn't sharp for 90 minutes of the game. They have world's best in Courtios, he does his job, you are cynical about that too. Hoodoo you say? I thought you guys were educated! Analyse deeper, going behind triggers the resolve of this brilliant brilliant side, PSG, Chelsea and Man City couldn't have come back from dead like RM does, says a lot about its quality and self belief. Please show some respect and as Karma would've it, RM will show you what they could in final as well, then you can sulk little more.
This idiots never give credit to real madrid for their win ESPN sucks
City lost it. Conceding two goals in stoppage time is schoolboy levels of naivety.
This game is a proof that God exists
Football gods shing on Liverpool with the fixtures they've had! Madrid deserve it by beating all top teams.
The reason of Real Madrid's winning is Pep Guardiola and then the player of man city not cuz of real Madrid was fantastic or phenomenal at that night. Finally here the recommendation for man city to win UCL as follows: 1. Mehraz out  2. Grealiah out 3. Raheem out  4. De Bruyne should be the captain  5. Bring or buy world class striker  6. Finally be advised that Pep to not over thinking to much.
It's funny people trying to explain these madrid wins😂😂😂😂
Madrid will defeat Liverpool as well.
Can we take a moment for the people that left the bernabéu because they though it was over.
There were dead, dead , dead 0:08
Any "expert" who said Real Madrid had no chance after the 1st leg shouldn't be talking about this sport. Especially since we've seen Real Madrid do this for so many years. PSG outplayed them in the first leg as well, it's not like you have to go back to the Ramos and Ronaldo days to see the mentality of this team or great remontadas. It's what they do.
11:38 BEST PART LMAOOOOOO ALE IS GOATED
Nacho was on fire 🔥
This real Madrid team keep on doing the unbelievable, unthinkable but they keep on writing us off, SELF BELIEVE can take you anywhere in the world and that's what this club have that no team have right now in the world
as a barca fan  you just have to say madrid are THE guys in europe
Where are those fuker pundits who were saying there is no chance for madrid to qualify noobs
Madrid moving like Prime Ole gunnar Soljskaers Manchester United 🤣
Benzema had 2 chances in first 10 minutes. What are these pundits on about?
Theses people talk some amount of nonsense
In the simple words of a certain Legend : FOOTBALL 'ERITAGE 😂😂😂   Goodbye Stockport City, Hala Madrid !!!
All credits to Don Carlo 🤍🔥
Craig absolutely spot on on Tuesday's preview
The problem is that you want to believe after seeing?
Only ali counted them out
Where is frank.  Is he keep his phone in airplane mode. I hope he should learn dnt disrespectful only cause madrid knocked his playing team Chelsea and his home national team psg.
I smell a lot of English club bias 👃🏾
I want Real Madrid to win. Then I wanna see Steve's face. 🤣
Am Glad you are all shocked at Madrid's Self Believe
Ancelotti was smoked them from that cigar on Saturday pass
C❤ A❤ M❤ A👊 V👊 I👊 N👊 G💪 A💪  Dont ever disrespect this Boy...👊👊👊💪💪💪💪💪💪💪 Eduardo Camavinga
Lost for words with what happened during these two legs. I’m hoping the final is even better 🔥
Messi and Barca fan But real madrid in UCL is  beast
My god . I hope Madrid smash Liverpool. This old man is absolutely miserable.
Sumtimes u just gotta accept that the remake is better than the  original; what am I talking about? (lotr) *RETURN OF THE KING (s)* ReAL t City *U SHALL NOT PASS...*
I have never seen a game more difficult for analysts to analyse. I mean where do you even start? nothing that happened at the Bernabeau was logical
Ah, the hallowed grounds of Santiago Bernabéu!
I knew Madrid ain’t done when the fans cheered them harder when they just conceded  the Mahrez goal
If there is one club in the world that should never be counted out is Real Madrid. Honestly the winning mentality of this club is unmatched. Incredible club. As a Man United fan I wish we had this winning mentality.
As a RM fan it’s so frustrating that every achievement of Real Madrid is downplayed year after year. You are looking back at one of the best teams/squads in history winning 3 champions leagues back to back, 4 in 5 years and all you hear from supporters and pundits is “yeah but they had Ronaldo” now we don’t have Ronaldo have to go though monsters of teams to get to the final and are still criticized… take Liverpool as an example Kloop is view as a genius to go though inter (that sold 150 million worth of star players the summer) benfica (who lets be honest aren’t the strongest team) and Villarreal a team which is 7. in its league
City, please go and lose to Newcastle as well on the weekend   Sincerely Yours  A Liverpool fan :D
it's been like this even in 2017 and 2018. They play terribly at times, yet somehow they succeed. Makes it so much more fun as a fan. Hala Madrid :)
Unpopular opinion: Ruben Diaz is nothing special!
The final will be the clash of an irresistible  force and an immovable object as far as self belief and mentality is concerned. Something will have to give, and I reckon it'll be Madrid.
Bro. Real Madrid were down 3-5 aggregate at 89mins in the second leg without a single shot on goal and they won the match without having to go to penalties... That's simply f*cked.
I don’t understand these pundits. How can Man city be better than Real Madrid, half of that RM team has won the CL 4 times, Madrid were the better team more direct and more experienced. Fancy football doesn’t pay at this top stage of football.
where is a the dumb nadium to tell us that city doesn't need a striker...pep today ? the biggest idiot in world football, city looked in the last minute like Phatetic group...and that won't change till forever, such an embarrassing performance booo boooo boooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Hala Madrid
History tradition that's the difference between a small club with oil money and a historic giant......
City lost it in the first leg!
All I can say Hala Madrid hasta el final.... fue una noche magica
Pundits talking about Madrid poor performance and how they didn't deserver the win, so when Militao, Carvajal and Alaba made mistakes which led to the Man City goals you end up labeling the whole Madrid squad as a poor lucky team with a shity defense and credit Man city attack. However when Man city concedes goals it comes down to poor individual mistakes by their defenders and you hear the pundits saying that Man city lost because of their defensive mistakes. Why can't you give Madrid the credit they deserve and stop making them look like they were given those 6 goals as a free donation from Man city.  The difference is that when Madrid concedes a goal they try to work hard and  find a way to counteract it. For them its all about getting that ball in the back of the net while they leave you have all the possession, all the stats and all the circus with the ball but at the end of the game, it is the score line that matters.
Man city are favourites for the Champions league next season😂 and the next one as well
I see a bit of bitterness from Nichol. We can say the same with with Liverpool in 2005, but this teams makes history after history. 5 finals in 9 years! Don't think that the King of Europe is dead until the end... Next stop, beat the hubcap snachers!
Pep could've won this tie with a set of better finishers...His ability to coach a creative unit against any team is amazing but ultimately, not everyone is Messi in front of goal. With some quality up front, no one will be safe next season.
Stevie is so bitter. Real Madrid outplayed Man City most of the 2nd leg.
You may be playing better, you may be more technical. What ever these stubborn guys want to say. But at the end of the day you are not Real Madrid. The thing that makes us different is our grit. Our mentality, our commitment to the badge. That’s what makes us different we have players that bleed white.
There will be no wonder if we say Champions League is a Real Madrid’s League. We believed on our all players till the end. Wow! Wow! magic of Santiago Bernabéu happened again.
The biggest scores win the match that is real Madrid Madrid 6 man City 5
It's a game of football it doesn't matter who had the ball more it's all about goals. Let's hope Madrid knock that smile off stevies face
The important thing about real Madrid is they respond immediately after scoring. They can score 2 goals in a minute if u r not careful. Perhaps u Shud slow the game down and pls don't score first against real it's a trap.
First leg man City score 4 Madrid score 6 so real Madrid is better than man City
Real had chances to score early in the game.. Possession was even abit so I don't see how City outplayed Madrid
All these analysts been betting against Real Madrid all along and they still haven't learnt. smh
I like Guardiola and he hits Man. City perfectly buut maaan why tf would you take off Debruyne 😔
This is the mentality that no team has in the world right now. How have they managed to turn this only god knows. Pls Liverpool don't make me sad.
What game was Stevie watching?? Real had chances to score just keep missing...
I knew it bcz  you only  win against us when the ref bj blows the final whistle hala madrid y Nada Mas
There is a reason why Rodrygo is called Mr Champions League… he has shown the uncanny ability to come on and finish off chances when it comes his way
African curse on Pep for mistreating Yaya Toure , he will never win champions league again, until he apologize to African gods🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nothing like mistake in Madrid man city match better team win that is Madrid
sorry to say this but you guys surely have the dumbest pundits in the world who keep counting RM out before every match only to get themselves proved wrong
Love seeing how salty Stevie is, but why is he an analyst?
Excellent. I haven't stopped Laughing yet. 👍👍👍👍👍
Hala Madrid for life
Pep stuffed this up big time subs crazy just crazy 🤪
It's crazy how the entire panel wrote Madrid off. .... The insane part is they're shocked. What's surprising
Madrid knockout 2 strong English team out of the champion league
Liverpool are wining the UCL
Man City bottled it. Why this team doesn’t get the criticism that PSG gets is beyond me. They spend years not being able to get past the quarterfinals. Man City invest a billion dollars in a team to win the Champions League (buying almost all the top level players they can in the Premier League)  & just to … Bottle it against Spurs. Bottle it against LYON. Bottle it against Chelsea. Bottle it against Real Madrid. Guardiola has been praised for years, but has failed to produce a Champions League for both Bayern and Man City. Meanwhile it took Tuchel 6 months to win it with Chelsea. Klopp has taken Liverpool to 3 finals in the last five years and won. Tuchel and Klopp are far superior coaches if you ask me. Outside of Barcelona, without Messi-Xavi-Iniesta… Guardiola has not produced anything aside from winning league titles (which mean nothing when you buy over half the top talent in those leagues IMO).
If you ever went through the Madrids trophy room, locker room and stadium - you get it.
I don't understand why everyone always focus on the opponent out playing Madrid. Madrid don't care about controlling games so opponents doing so is nothing special. It doesn't worry them
People this is a knock-out competition. Football is a game where, despite one team dominating, the other can still win. It happens Ali the time in many sports. City just lost because of this. You cannot 💯 guarantee a win..... that why we watch. Calm down calm down the red are gonna blow them away.... maybe maybe not!
City certainly deserves to be slaughtered, taking out the best strikers, best midfielder is a big blunder.
Too bad Real won't have a 2nd game to wait to get lucky in the finals....Liverpool will show everyone how to kill this Madrid team and bury them after that!  On the other hand pep has got to be wondering what was he thinking resting most of his starting players for the last 5 mins....he had nothing left on the field to even compete at the last moment.
English people: "It's not that Real Madrid is a good team. It's magic and power of friendship that made them get to the finals."
Well you are again underestimating Real madrid And this is nothing new. Camavinga or Valverde in place of Kross in the midfield and Rodrygo on the right will mAke Real madrid more dangerous as we saw.
Where are those EPL fans who downplayed Real's chances? We are the greatest club in the world for a reason!! The arrogance from EPL fans is intolerable
Do these guys even watch the match ? Real madrid were definitely on top in the first half.  City became better after they made their substitutions
There's something carrying this Madrid team and it's not tactics and luck but something beyond what the human eyes can perceive 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I hope you don't write off real Madrid again in the final
Once it went to extra time, the look on Pep's face was evident. He knew Madrid had won the game in their minds. Its called WINNING MENTALITY. Barca had it too under Pep but City will take time to develop it. It can't be taught. It can't be bought. It can just be felt.
What people don't realises is that peps tactics would have won in the 2010s teams these days have evolved and pep and mourinho game plans can no longer work vs the elite teams... Back then the way barca played was never seen.. A team controlling possession like that made teams scared  but these days most teams implemented these possession tactics and how to defend against them.
Very snobbish from y'all English man,say the truth  n that is city is not a big team, Simon Jordan says it every time n ppl get on on his back but its evident every champions league season  that city is not a big team, it a good team n has a big bank like their bro PSG but a big team they not
Stevie got to realize before boasting of Liverpool been favourites, Real Madrid have already clinched LaLiga and can afford to rest their key players and focus only on the Final while Liverpool have a key matches to play with the hope of catching Man City, therefore, they(Liverpool) can't afford to rest players and thereby risk injuries.
I am loving it how these English men are burning because Madrid won the match.
I knew from that first leg that Man city had conceded too many goals now it bit them in the back
Teams with Winning Mentality win the big game. No coach can teach it, you can't see but still you can feel. These Madrid players have won so much with this team, they just don't accept the defeat until final whistle and luckily they had two big games against PSG & City both the teams who have tasted success domestically but still don't have that much success internationally to have that self belief. Rather City & PSG started to see the loss once Madrid scored 2 in 2 minutes.
Liverpool wins astoundingly against Milan against all odds, its not weird. Real Madrid comes back against Man City, thats weird. These so called pundits are so biased, especially that Steve 'Ronald McDonald', such a clown. Real Madrid has the calibre and the grit to win the Champions league, most importantly they have Benzema.
Camavinga much better than orrerated Casemiro....I have to blame Pep here unfortunately
"It's nothing fantastic" "It's nothing out of the ordinary"... You're lost, good sir... What happened in the champions semifinal is the definition of fantastic, of extraordinary.
Where’s the consistency, when it’s PSG they’re bottlers but when it’s Man City it’s a mystery.
Nedum is a gem pundit 🙌🏾
There's a slight difference between luck and fixing... This is Papa Perez Pizza fixing like always...
Wow bravo to Madrid that was amazing, but I wanted them in the final anyway sick of playing city but the show is over now time to get revenge and get number 7
This rebuilding Madrid just exposed the best teams in the world. This shows how far Don Carlo is on a different level. A Gareth Bale takeover in the final to hash the beef with the Madrid fans is the last cherry on top before the World Cup. Even if they lose the final, they will get a free Mbappe and Rudiger. What a team.
at 5-5, why didn't real go through by the 3 away goals in the 1st leg? why is extra time needed?
I was telling some of my friends who thought that City were guaranteed to go through, that you can never, ever write off Real in this competition. It is basically their private property.   City having a nation’s wealth behind them, but ‘only’ managing 1 final plus 2 more semi-final appearances in 11 attempts in this competition, is pretty funny underachievement.
Stevie Nicol, to refresh your memory, we COMFORTABLY beat Liverpool LAST SEASON, we have improved a lot since then Liverpool have improved a little so don't say Liverpool are far better than Real Madrid. Vinicius had a party against them last year 😂 😂 😂 HALA MADRID!!!
Here, none of them believed that Real Madrid could win.
Carlo Ancelotti is a DON!
When Varane made mistakes under Zizou & ManCity won, no one called out Football God's!!!
Imagine how good this team becomes when Mbappe joins.
How HYPOCRITIC is that?? Real Madrid has won LaLiga & People say Barca was bad! They beat PSG, it's Luck! They beat Chelsea, it's again Luck! They beat ManCity, & now it's FOOTBALL GODS🧐😈  It's like the players playing for REAL are idiots & nothing else. God's make them jump, God's make other teams make mistake, God's ...god's and god's..🤣😂🤣😂
Where are those mofo city fans with big out?
Inspirational performance
Manchester City needs a striker...i think they would ve won if they had a good striker..i see many people saying that guardiola is a flop,more than 30 trophies...these people are simply haters, has if the manager is guilty of the team giving 2  goals in 2 minutes...and madrid played second leg home against all teams, they were lucky..
That Camavinga display was world-class
I love the fact that Madrid showed what Oil cannot buy and that’s character. The final should be incredible because now we have two teams who, for me, are the most historic clubs of all time.
Ale moreno doing pretty good with the fanboying this time, he only said RRREAL MADRRRI 6 times in 55 seconds! Well done lad!!
That penalty against City was not a penalty. Referee was against City
Steve Nicol comes off very biased as usual, the reality is that football is not about stats, keeping possession, about dribbling, and so on. This sport is about scoring goals and having a psychological strength. RM was "outplayed" in terms of chances and possession, however, RM was stronger psychologically and kept the team tight and scored 3 chances they had. In that way one can say Madrid was a better team and played better football, in the end, one can say that RM controlled the game as they managed to hold the score for 90 minutes and their possibilities.
As Ale said, what has happened in the last 16, quarters and semis is supernatural.. The footballing gods are definitely with Madrid. City was playing against spirits from the 89th minute.
How many penalties does real madrid get? Thats how they win
That's why you need to be a mentality monster. If it was Jurgen Klopp in peps position he would have gotten a reaction from the players immediately.
Great to see another fake shitty club bring taken out.
Let everyone talk! We will be on the pitch and will win! By any means necessary
Chelsea were unlucky. If that Var decision against Alonso didn’t go through it would’ve been Chelsea in the semi finals.
Man City aka noisy neighbours aka champions league chokers😂🤣
1. How come Pep didn't see this coming is incomprehensible. If there is any manager who knows Real Madrid it's him.  2. Poor from City not to waste time in the final minutes of the first 90. You'd expect experienced players like Fernandhinho and Gundogan to do that.  3. Awful body language and no belief in the extra time.
The moment they took out KDB and Mahrez that changed the game
I have to said that champions knows how to win👍 & response  They are 13 times 🏆  Even a Barca fan I had to apauld them👍
Jesus was this guy chewing a toffe while saying  his "R"s
Real Madrid subs made the difference while man city subs did not.
Espn Fc crew are the worst at predictions🤣
Pep bottled it…how can he make such substitutions🤦🏽
The goals by madrid were good goals. They weren't lucky goals at all. Stevie is talking about bad defending by city but the chances that man city was bad defending by Madrid. The mahrez should've been saved. Its a goal on the near post of the keeper. That's a goal keeping error  should've been avoided. The grealish chances was bad defending as well.
seems like Real Madrid read Frank's book
Stevie just can't admit it and keeps try on to defend city and say they shouldn't be slaughtered and it was individual mistakes yet not one goal came from individual mistakes yet with psg was slaughtered because of individual mistakes but he blamed the team ..all these pundits predicted that man city will go through and am loving it 😂😂 They praise English football too much they forget that every league is has its difficulty  No city player was bad all real Madrid players were just good
Gabs looks so disappointed with the city loss.. You'll try and be honest and criticize pep and man city when it's time to do that... You'll would jump at man utd, arsenal and Chelsea easily if they were the ones.
Guys Guys Guys  !!!! real Madrid ARE the football gods!
Now I guess EsPn panelists who wrote us off and they always do will change their mindset …. It is not about playing well…. It’s all character and Madrid got it!! …….. Madrid is the best club in the world!!!!
as for Liverpool being Favorites they too arent great defensively Villareal are 7th in laliga & scored 2 easily past them also Benfica created chances home & away so will be very interesting ...
Because you do not football.
Love them or hate them, Real Madrid KNOW how to win UCL games.
See I am not a big psg man but I think man City did were a bigger bottler than psg. What are your thoughts?
If u didn't think real could still win at 90min mark you haven't been watching the games this season, I expected a Benzema double at 90th
I went from drunk to sober when Rodrygo headed that 2nd goal in
I was gutted when we lost to Villarreal on Europa finals, I feel better now as this city loss is far much worse
Will come back here when madrid win the UCL
pretty poor from so called experts to say nothing for 90mins... Benzy a clear header off target a shot off target vini couple good chances off target the only control Man City had were what Real Madrid allowed them.. we didnt overly press we were calm and controlled playing out the back multiple times and very easily also... unfortunately these guys think EPL is the be all... Real Madrid had 2 new CBs & a coach come in & they still found a way to knock out PSG Chelsea & now Man City
The shot on target stat is pure nonsense. You could have 10 clear cut chances and put them all wide. It doesn't mean that the team didn't have 10 clear cut chances it just means the missed the target.
MCI and PSG show why having great players don't make you a great team.
I don't know why people think real Madrid played poorly in the first half, they had 3-4 chances but Benzema blew them all. He has been scoring those all season. He was missing his shooting boots today.
You guys not giving Kyle walker enough credit
Are we just gonna stay dumb to the 2 tackles by casemiro.....such a joke😶😶
Camavinga best player of Madrid currently,  that boy is among the best 👌
Espn is so bad the only sipost  English  club worh a gowk you ar
Carlo The Don
These guys are so disrespectful
Could it be that Yaya Toure's agent is right? 😏🤔
Why everyone saying real madrid didn't do anything in 90 mints. They created big chances. Vini, karim missed chances. MADRID  made good moves and brought ball into box several times. They had a great start in second half. Few lovely runs by vini. It's not luck. Madrid played well to win it
Coincidence? Psg, Chelsea & now man City
Where’s stevie at ??? And Craig absolutely joke pundits
Man City was Sloppy
No one going to mention the referee.  How bad he was. Gave every decision to real Madrid.  Let players gey away with bad challenges.  Only added 3 minutes stoppage time after all the time wasting.  The real players were also a disgrace.  Diving cheating time wasting
“Dead but not barried”😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dias kept on making risky tackles in the 18-yard box, so I wasn’t surprised when he eventually caused the penalty.
Man City have to get some new fresh faces and new strategy for the new season.
FODEN MOST OVERRATED
Never mind city there's always a next time
Prevent defense only prevents you from winning.
Logic doesn't work in this team🤣🤣🤣 The best line, they playing against all odds, must be the work of football gods😂😂
PSG and City are the bottlers now🤣🤣
I think Madrid are gonna shock Liverpool. Casemiro is gonna horribly injure someone on purpose and won't be carded at all and Benz is gonna break Ronaldo's record.
Did stevie really compare real madrid with a sunday league team? All they do is credit Madrid's wins to luck or how the opposition did not play well. Show some respect. The teams madrid eliminated were all favorites PSG, chelsea and Man City
In a weird way I actually wanted City to score first in the first half because they seem to be more nervous whenever they take the lead
Even when Man. City scored, the Madrid fans were still behind the team. Amazing set of football fans!
If you want to bet on football games listen to what Steve Nicol says  and do the opposite.
can someone count how many times nadum blinked in this?
This guy's especially  stevie  just doesn't  learn do they they underestimate  real against psg,   then against  Chelsea  then against city now they r underestimating them against  liverpool  call about arrogance  and ignorance  no matter we all know what's gonna happen in the final 🤣🤣🤣
" football heritage" - Jose Mourinho
Since the beginning of CL, I, as a Liverpool fan, would like to have revans vs Madrid, I think we didn't deserve to lose in 2018, due to Ramos foul, and 2 blunders from Karius, hopefully this time Liverpool win 🤲 Aamiin
The only thing more satisfying than Real Madrid making it to the final is these ESPN clowns eating their own words all season long .. HALA MADRID
Match-fixing Still exists 🥵🥵
It's outrageous that these guys think madrid are lucky. Passion and belief is more important in football. City was creating chances but if you don't finish that then you are not a better team. Madrid was just clinical.
Lmaoo now Stevie is scared for Liverpool
Media hate Real Madrid, don't they? The meltdown everytime they win is very funny. Won't change the fact they'll always be the best club. The final will be amazing with two legendary teams .
Pep always overthink things too much that is why it will be very difficult for city to win the championship league
I have witnessed magic yesterday....vamoss
And then there’s most of espn who were so sure of city to go through.
Grandpa Steve is annoyed. His days of glory of any were no where close to even what a 21 year old is doing in Champions Leauge semi final. The level of disrespect these guys have shown to real madrid is unreal!!! All of these so called football pundits had already given the win to Manchester city. All they are holding now are the wet wipes.
Where is Craig tonight ESPN ? Hiding under again as usual?😂😂
In football you need a bit of luck just as Thomas Tuchel always say
Everybody wants to play against Real Madrid until they play Real Madrid❤️
Man city is overrated
😂😂😂😂the pundits wrong predictions as usual
It’s a sad day for ESPN premier lol
You can not logically analyse this game, with the kind of luck real madrid has this season even if Man City had scored 3 goals they would have still lost the game.   Sometimes its just has simple as that.
HALLA MADRID
Where is the energy Stevie, go on and criticise Madrid again, would love to see that, keep counting Madrid out and we will continue to prove all  you English pundits wrong time in and out again, we are Real Madrid, The Kings of Europe, put some resect to our name, we are 13 times champions of Europe, its not fluke, its sheer brilliance, self-believe, mentality and courage to be honest.
Ale is speaking as if he is just started watching football last week Real Madrid is the champions League It's their competition
Nacho is world-class
I don't know what game they did watch but in 2nd leg game was balanced real was able to play through the back and had fair share of possession  and after the city scored Real had a go and city can't defend . The difference was when real Madrid needed the goal they got two in dying minutes of game but city were seen very unlikely to get a goal when they were behind
Kay- why did everyone count real Madrid out after the first leg???  Me- everyone?? Or you mean the dumbasses at the espn studio??
Kudos to Real Madrid and Man City because the winner of this seasons UCL was determined tonight. Man City are an incredible team and club and Pep has done a fantastic job. Man City need to forget this loss and focus on Newcastle, recover and win the premier league. Next season Man City get players they need and go again, we will eventually win this champions league.
how're they even doing it?luck or good buildup play?If they defeat liverpool it'll become even crazy.
00:25 wrong again Ale. Players and the Madridistas. Not a single soul left even at the 90th from the stadium and we too. We kept watching as the times were getting less.
Rodrygo is super talented, and I'm happy he was able to make his mark amongst so many great players. Well done, Real Madrid.
De Bruyne ghosted
Happy Days.
Real Madrid are comeback kings in Europe everyone thought they are dead but they keep proving everyone wrong
The way fake pundits like Jimie Carragher discredit Real Madrid is unreal. If this comeback was done by an English team, he'd be jumping all over the place.
It's simply the Yaya curse
Keep underestimating them, keep debating why the other team is stronger and more balanced, fact remains that Real Madrid are a force to be reckoned, an irresistible force, whether of not Liverpool is the immovable object, remains to be seen.
Which games did you guys watch? You were like real madrid didn't create any chance till 90 mins and suddenly..... There were chances but attempts were wasteful. And most of the city shorts were from outside the box before that goal, considering courtois only concede one two goals a season from outside the box, that attempts were not that big. So stop completely outplayed, voodoo, blah blah. City were good but not by mile and match goes on till final whistle. HalaMadrid

I'm celebrating one of the most remarkable comebacks in UCL history and these guys are mourning. Let these guys tell it, Madrid should have given up and ceded the game because City "deserved" it.
Hala madrid , with all the respect to you all , real madrid plays to the last second,  if you snooze you lose ,, what a magical team , hala madrid
Camavinga is the future of the best midfielders. He has done a turn up for Real Madrid against PSG, Chelsea Man city. People never talked about this guy. What a player!
Are you crazy Ali? Madrid were the better team
Real Madrid = New England Patriots with Brady
Pep is overrated he not a great coach he was lucky to coach Barcelona
funny those City "fans" from last week have disappeared. gone back to wearing their previous club's shirt...
I actually think that City was playable for most part of the game yesterday. Their biggest chances came after the first goal when Real had to open up and they were very vulnerable at the back. But up to that point, it wasn't a game where City were that much superior, they probably have been a little more dangerous, but Real had their chances too. Even though they didn't have a shot on goal, they had chances, I mean for example Vinicius missed an open goal for christ sake.  So it was a surprisingly even game up into the first goal, after the first goal City dominated for 15 minutes but like guys said, they didn't bury Real and after the first Rodrygo goal that came from nowhere, the magic happened once again at Bernabeu. There are many things to improve in Real's game, but they certainly have a very unique fighting spirit and ability to rise up in moments in which you think they are already finished. Maybe it's not logical that they are in the final, but it's definitely not a coincidence.
Man City is a domestic team.
Lol they slaughtered psg and not city hipocracy, they had tie in hand with so little time
I think it’s fair to say if Real Madrid win the Champions League this year it will probably be the first ever fluke Champions League win. Also let me say this, how Casemiro didn’t get his second yellow card in the 31 or 32 minute is beyond me!!!
Logic says Real had the better chances and should've killed the game off way earlier.
At some point Pep has to be considered a failure at city. Domestically City are dominant but they were winning the PL before Pep got came. He was brought in specifically to win the CL. Nearly a billion spent and still not won it.
Vs PSG 2nd leg (madrid home) + comeback Vs Chelsea 2nd leg (madrid home) + comeback Vs man city 2nd  (madrid home) + comeback Match Fixing OR Luck ???
حتئ وان كذبتم علئ مشجعين دوريكم الانكليزي و ستطعتم اقناعهم ان تشيلسي و ستي كانو الافضل. لن تستطيعوا الكذب علئ العالم الذين شاهدو ريال مدريد في 3 مباريات اسطوريه. هناك حقيقه ثانيه عليكم الاعتراف بها. الانديه الانكليزيه لا تستطيع الوقوف امام ريال مدريد حته لدقائق قليله 😅 ريال مدريد اعظم نادي في التاريخ ولديهم شي مميز في دوري الابطال.
The biased media never learn😂Never underestimate Real Madrid.
Bent referees are nothing new to spain
This was a match of mental toughness. Madrid plays like if they’ve never ever lost a match in their life, no matter what. City crapped their pants when Madrid scored. They shrunk, Madrid grew. This was mental match. City is the better team, and I say as a Madrid fan. But Madrid is mentally the toughest team I’ve seen in a long time. The ties with PSG and Chelsea gave them that mental confidence. Well deserved to those boys. They have a BRIGHT future ahead
Give madrid the credit and stop explaining why city lost
Nah bro I was believed they can come back, I counted every minute as if they had ___ time to come back 🥰
Hahahaha Stevie you are pathetic. You were so sure your English side was going to knock out the kings of Europe. Know your place old man. Your Liverpool are next. I'm sure you'll give Real no chance to win. Lol
Man City yikes!
2002-2019 New England Patriots  1990’s Chicago Bulls  1980’s Los Angeles Lakers  Mid 2010’s to early 2020’s Real Madrid   The most dominant teams in the History of Sports. All of those teams I just mentioned had heart and grit and fought and clawed their way to each championship they won. It’s unbelievable.
It took them 90' to put more than one player in the box for a cross.
How good is Pep really? Luis Enrique won treble with Barca, Heynkes won treble, Pep took over and failed to even reach CL final, Flick comes and wins treble. City last 6 seasons have gone out in ties they were favourites. FRAUDIOLA. Give any competent manager the resources Pep gets and they will do the same or better. Heck Pelligrini was winning the league and took City to semi long before Pep
Referre helps madrid to go final.that was not a penalty.
Win I saw the that man city scored I was like now I left went on the road an said that's it if they can't score in extra time then they are dead I came back in the wifi check the score a I wanted to shout
it was a rodrigo game same as diaz with villareal
I wonder if these guys actually watch the game Madrid played really well today, they had many chances its just they werent clinical, until Rodrygo
MANCITY had 4 clear on target and technical shots to goal. But the goalkeeper was the best player for saving Real and Rodrygo made the team to win
Real madrid players had many clutch moments which honestly could have gone both ways..and man city had 0 such moments..at the end no matter how good u coach mentality comes within you..man city is psg of England for sure..no doubt great league team but not a good knockout team...i wont even blame the coach this time..in last 5 years he literally tried many possible style...even used game slowing players just to get result which is unlikely of pep..but at the end players choke for few min n game is done u have to feel for pep.
Allie's takes are annoying af, does anyone else feel this way?
Lol 😂 love it
Bro madrid has this pundits talking witch craft 💀
City are bottle merchants bigger than PSg tbh,  they have lost to lyon, Chelsea and real madrid in last 3 years whem they were  heavy favorites pep manages disater class again and no one criticize him
Donaroma is the reason Madrid wins this champions league
Stevie - I don't like Madrid ...but do you remember what happened the last time they played L'pool in a final? I was shocked as to how they somehow beat Chelsea but credit to them and their mentality. 🙏
Vinicius jnr scored the second goal of header,rodrygo scored the first
What a team. Real Madrid is such an inspiration. Hala Madrid. Proud to be Madristas
Taste that humble pie Nedom 🤣
Benzema for ballon d’or no matter if they win or lose the final. If they win it is a given, if they don’t he still should be favorite. What a baller that man sheesh
Until those 2 minutes of sheer luck. Until those 2 goals... Madrid looked a shadow of themselves and couldn't go anywhere near the ball. I didn't see any skill in the game from them but sheer luck. People call it determination but you need to see work result in a deserved outcome. But I didn't see any Madrid player play well last night.
No way Real Madrid eliminated all the teams who were semi-finalists in last year's Champions League 🤩🤩🤩
Nobody talking about Vinicius missing a sitter 8 seconds into second half and the countless times he fumbled in front of goal. Madrid were the better team for 60 mins
Real Madrid have beaten PSG along with the God of Football, and the rest is history.  They know that there is nothing impossible for them.
Steve Nicol=Salty PL Pundit lol
Pep is a fraud. 6 years in a row he has lost as the favourites in the tie he went out. Monaco, Liverpool, Spurs, Lyon, Chelsea and now Real.   Pep also failed at Bayern after taking over a treble winning side and failed to lift CL but when Flick took over after, treble again for Bayern
i always said scoring first against real madrid is a trap
Cause when you put on the "Blanco" of Real Madrid.  You feel it. The weight of the history, the silverware, the magic in the badge.   Anything's possible.
"Why did anyone count them out?" They were out played for 170 of the 180 normal time minutes lol. YNWA
The game is never over until the final whistle is blown, an ugly win is always better than the pretty loss. The game is won by goals scored not by who played better or the most attractive football. When it comes down to some teams the outcome is always unpredictable…
Can’t wait for City to be predicted to be favourites in the summer again 🤣
Nadum analysis is great but he needs a better microphone. 😉🤭
Too much excuses guys😂😂😂
Pep needs a viagra. He can't get past a semi...
The young Real players have already developed that never give up mentality.  Nacho and Militao had essentially stopped playing as they were just walking with the ball in the final minutes but Camavinga and Rodrygo pushed till the end and now here we are. The future is bright for Real
All man city needs a lethal striker.They really played beautiful football.
Everyone has played well but hats off to Courtois he literally saved real madrid many times in the whole game
Remember at 2010, inter maintain 2 goals lead against best barca team ever at camp nou with 10 players, while pep with multi-billion dollar player couldnt maintain 2 goals lead against worst Madrid team ever to reach ucl final. This is why mourinho > pep.
Steve nicole i have listened you before 2nd leg you need be neutral 🤣
Where is steve 🤣🤣🤣
I agree with ale moreno. Liverpool are favourites but there is nothing natural and logical about real madrid this season.  Man city game would have been easier for Liverpool. Now madrid one is tricky one, although Liverpool have faced only tricky opponents in the knockouts this season. While madrid have been 2nd favourites in all their knockout games.  It will be a nervy final on 28th for sure. If Liverpool manage to win the league and fa Cup before that, then they will give their all. If they only manage fa cup, they will still give their all.  Madrid have a rest of the season to prepare for this final, so they will give their all. They got through knock outs when most of others thought otherwise, so they will try to give their all to finish it on the top.
Urgency kicked in when City scored
To think that Real Madrid won by playing the final minutes and extra time with Benzema, modric,kroos,casimero and Vini on the bench!. The winning mentality and never say die attitude of Madrid is incredible.
These guys are just salty because they won't be getting all english final
Man city got fergie time
Holy cow those high pitch screams from Ale!
Real Madrid missed chances too and were good in 1st half and good until Mahrez scored. You won't say that as it won't fit your agenda to hype English teams.
Benzema and Madrid. Players knocked Guardiola and city out of champions league ...
although Madrid did not have shot on target, there were good chances created by Madrid which benzema and vini jr missed. so it was not as one sided for the 90 mins as the panel is pointing out.
Haha this panel makes me laugh they wrote out real madrid chance after the 1st leg. Now they are  praising this team.
Now it's the God's lol ... how about City never finished their chances and RM seized on their opportunities lol. Oh yes and you can't slaughter them because they've been HAILED as the greatest team since sliced bread. Due to hyping the Premier league sooo much, it's now hard to attack City knowing they may still win the league lol... I know pundits I know😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
It's never over until it's over and Real Madrid has learned to believe so...Besides, from the images Guardiola clearly did not believe his team had the final in the pocket after Mehrez goal...he had a quite scared face during the entire match. What a football game!
Say Real Madrid again 🤣🤣🤣
Two most important players today, who are very underrated  One is Nacho who was superb defensively Second is Camavinga, exceptional talent
'Football is different from basketball'  ~ Gab Marcotti
What's the difference between these ESPN football pundits and a bunch of bananas... Bananas are a bunch of fruit hanging in a tree ... These clowns are a bunch of idiots in a studio
See when I questioned Diaz, people came after!!! When I questioned City people came over lol... I'm not surprised because City are a GREAT Premier league team, but not a GREAT European team
it needs mentality to win the champions league,it was waste of my a night with suporting city.
The people who leave the stadium before the ref has blown the final whistle, should not be allowed in a stadium ever again!
30 seconds into video and ur bashing real Madrid again??? I can't with u guys it's becoming a joke I'm about turn this rubbish off. Did u c the chances we had????? we defended much better as a team...  city did nothing most of the game we had the better chances for sure this game foh.
Listening to an emotional ALE makes me believe that the EPL is overrated. Liverpool almost collapsed at the hands of Villareal. Man City has been knocked out of the Champions leagued by Real Madrid. We have a problem with English teams.
Why is anybody not talking about Pep taking off Mahrez, that was a big moment! That for me is one of the reasons they lost..Mahrez was a threat.He just has moments of magic in his boots!
At the end of the day Real Madrid is the BEST club in the world. This UCL will sement it. We have to beat PSG, Chelsea, Mancity and Liverpool. Treble loading…
Let me be the first one to say it here that city and PSG will bottle it again next year.
Real, unbelievable belief City, unbelievable disbelief That was the difference maker
Can't wait to see Rodrygo and Haaland warming the City bench in next year's champions league semi final and come on for the final 5 mins when they're 2 down
I am very happy by listening pundit's saying Liverpool are favourite. This is what Real Madrid give extra dose to beat a English teams.
When he says that real madrid were dead, does he mean to say the equal possession before those goals, does he mean the higher 1st half xg, does he mean equal no. Of shots, does he mean the higher overall xg and more no. Of big chances. They are all just salty because all them underestimated madrid, even as a madrid fan, at 89th minute I thought it was all over, but still I was proud the way my team played because  they had shown heart to win.
City is a baby still
Steve Nicol is a clown. Doesn't give anyone due credit
Wrong again, you fool. The first 15 minutes of the second half, Madrid was creative and dangerous. They stole the ball from City and played beautifully. This fool speaks as if Madrid did nothing until the miracle happened en minute 91. That wasn't a miracle, it was a brilliant attacking move from Madrid which shows what Camavinga, Benzema and Rodrygo can do in just 5 seconds. In these games, miracles don't exist; exceptional players is what really exist.
Cry more😷
the team crumble under pressure , the veterans and youngsters alike. It's amazing 💎💎💎
Class is permanent
ive been saying this since the spurs game, dias and laporte arent good enough
You re wrong Ale. I was one of those fans who were staring at the screen thinking can there be another comeback still at 89th minute
I believe city is going to fumble in epl As well
Steve is so toxic, he never credits real madrid ever
Turning point was walker injury.....
Once real madrid scored 3rd city totally gave up.
Thess failure of  a so callled "analysts" makes you always believe like only Man City missed chances
I love it here
Match of the year
Of all the panelists Ali Moreno irritates me 😟 the guy is too much drama.
@Steve Nicol. Please retire. ESPN, when you discuss Madrid games, bring an analyst that was a Madrid player, or that is at least respectful with the club. Too much condescension from "has beens" in this network towards the best club in history. It's painful to watch you guys.
These guys talking like its all Man City's mistake and RM did not play well at all. I saw the game it was not like that.  Stats speaks for it. Typical english speaking media.
Pep is overated and the English commentators give him a high. Hala Madrid.                                            Written off against Psg by the panel. Written off against Chelsea by the panel.                                                 Written off against Man City by the panel in the first leg
Casemiro should of been semt off after 20 mins thats the voodoo!
Self belief,sheer determination and metal toughness seperates real Madrid from other teams.
Yaya Toure's agent was right. Pep will never win a champions league again
All Liverpool fans are happy and a little scared about the final, me included.
But I think against Liverpool there going to beaten
Beautiful Real Madrid
Madrid are masters of this competition. They are the royalty of football. But don’t sleep on Liverpool, Salah was hoping to play Madrid.
Ale lowkey such a great analyst. So true about City’s inability to get ugly - they win the PL because it’s a war of attrition against so many other teams - only Liverpool and Spurs seem to challenge them
If you want to believe in magic then you got to believe in curse too. City is curse to win UCL and Pep is curse not to win any UCL besides Barca, Messi, Xavi and Iniesta. I wonder what's Pep next clube will be. Time for Pep to go to PSG and reunited with Messi and win UCL again 😆 🤣
Camavinga the real MVP of the game. That boy was insane and you think hes only 19
They said Never giving up is in our DNA That's Real Madrid for You Tough Mentality Onto the Final lets go Hala Madrid 🤍❤🤟
I swear these guys predict  City as favourites for the CL EVERY YEAR!
I don't care bc we've got a few football Gods of our own that always shine down on us ,  the thing is the final won't be at Bernabeu  or Anfield so the God's will battle it out on a neutral ground and Shanks and Paisley,  Fagan and all the LFC greats will be with us and more importantly Klopp and our amazing football team. YNWA
Before the tournament started, the favorites were ( in no particular order) Man city, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Chelsea and PSG.  For Real Madrid to win will mean that they single handedly will have eliminated 4 out of the 5. Pretty incredible. Real Madrid truly deserve to be champions.
we want bayern and real madrid next season!! it should be a proof if they can really beat the bundesliga champions. still HALA MADRID!
How espn can handle this victory ??? They don’t like Spanish teams at ol 😹😹😹
WHO KNOWS SANTILIANA and KHUANITO, that people understand me.
The history boys The fantasy club ❤️❤️❤️
You guys should be ashamed of yourself.
There is something special about Real Madrid Team.
I swear City and Pep must be paying these pundits to go easy on them. Could you imagine Klopp and Liverpool gave up 3 goals in 6 mins with a 2 goal advantage heading into the 90th? Stevie Nicol would create a petition to get Klopp sacked and say Liverpool bottled it.
I’ve got a new theory on how to predict the winners in CL knockout stages. 1. Look at the  clubs DNA. 2. If they have come backs in round of 16 or quarter finals. 3. Ability to take control of first leg especially away matches. 4. Strong lead at home especially in the first leg. Among all these factors 1 and 2 go together.
This club is just incredible
It was the best win we had in this UCL so far. Love this team 💓. Ath Madrid also tried that gamble but our gamble paid. Its White Magic. Probably the most hardest path we took, PSG > Chelsea > City ; what a terrible path
Espn fc and their logic with Real Madrid ... absolutely hilarious
Courtois and Benzema are the real hero of this club
Why should city not be slaughtered? Spent 100+ million on CBs. Dias is supposedly the one of the best in the world. Grealish 100 million. What did any of the big names in city do in the game. Sterling no impact, de Bryune was quiet, Foden no output. Pep bottled it again and it’s a fact. The game I watched was different as compared to the panel. RM was the better team. RM could’ve been ahead if Vin would’ve taken his chance(s). Camavinga was running the show. Respect Madrid! They have had toughest run in. Liverpool is great team but they have had an easier run in comparison.
Next season City bottles it with Haaland ;)
last second losing to Spurs in the 2019 UCL semis, blowing it against Chelsea in the final last year and now this? Man City greatest chokers in recent memory.
Pep substitutions were awful
REAL won not today, they won week ago, when they scored 3!!!! goals in Manchester.....understood??????????
Watch who Madrid brat compare to how liverpool beat on their way to the finals
I can not imagine when Mbappe joins us and Ruddier and Tchouameni.
Love watching these Espn guys get it wrong 100 percent of the time against Real Madrid.  They picked Psg, then they picked Chelsea, then they picked Man City.  These guys are experts right?
The clubs is GOAT
Alejandro Moreno is a hater, you can see it. Madrid wasn’t dead, the win is due to hard work, determination, heart, and mentality
so psg chelsea and city are better sides than madrid according to stevie, this isnt even bias anymore, its madness, you madman LOL
Real Madrid is playing like they are playing in a Fifa career mode.
Englisg bias is clear in tye eyes of stevie nicol
Those guys are so cringing to listen to
Steve nicol-i would rather play manchester city rather than real madrid in final.fellas mark my words It will age really well.
Dear Pundits don't pick us in the final you will jinx us.  Hala madrid
This is the champions league
Yes! Gotta agree with Ale that when U needed to play ugly, U just gotta do it? The point is the MC players didn't apply this mentality in the key 1-min moment btwn the 2 RM's goals at the end of FT means that MC as a whole is still not very good? Yes! A match goes on for 90+ mins and a bit more and every second (moment) counts!!!  😛
You can beat a good team but never a lucky one.
just so lucky
Chelsea is ok there are no wya better than real
Eee toh sala hona hin tha
These guys are trying so hard to not give Real Madrid the respect for the great skill they have
Whichever fan left before 90, screw off. Halamadridynadamas
Cyah wait to beat pool again to hear what stevie say
Two very special and unpredictable teams head-to-head in the final. That's one thing I'd love to bet on. Such an incredible incident.
Benzeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemaaaaa😘😘
Reporter: "How did Real win?" Jose Mourinho: " Football Heritage"
Dear baldy, you don't know about real madrid fans do you? Because I was standing up at 87th min, and sat down at 92nd min. Didn't go anywhere.. Didn't flinch.  We RM fans knew this was coming.
REAL MADRID ONLY TEAM in the WORLD WHO CAN DO IT............Never ask HOW THEY DO it !!!!!!!!!!! You young, stupid people, who didn't see, how real did it 50, 40, 30 years ago. DON't ask, just watch and have your orgazms.
Stevie Nicole," Football gods have pulled them through somehow" with an angry face shows the level of bias this English media has
The look on Gab face said it all,he enjoyed d Madrid victory
There's a lot of RM fans in the comments of the last game who saw this. Based on the second half, they felt they could comeback in the return leg.
The same way Liverpool think Real Madrid is the weaker of the 2 teams is how Madrid sees Liverpool,  Man. City is the harder team to beat and we've  done it ...now bring on #2 in PL Liverpool..Rematch granted!!
Please ancelotti! Don't start kroos in the final! Our odds of victory will increase significantly.
Well rodrygo proved  his part of real madrid history now even tho am barcelona fan I still love madrid my two favorite
The panelist absolute disregard for the well worked goals for Madrid and stinking bias for these English sides is appalling. PSG deserved to be criticized and Mancity not? All I hear is no shots on targets, count how many decent build ups, Vini’s miss, unlucky bobbles between vini and Benzema. I pray for Stevie’s sake LFC wins this UCL.
All the signs point to a madrid winning it all... defeated psg, Chelsea and city in an underdog manner.
Vinicius Jr played amazing and created so much trouble to city.....were these guys watching the same match?
I mean.. what does a man like Steve Nicol have to be on espn talking this stupid and getting paid I don’t understand
Pep Guardiola shame on you man you spend a lot of money for Bayern Minnich and Man City you didn’t win the Champions League for them
I don't get it, at full time Madrid were ahead on away goal! why did they play extra time?!
Three guys actually get paid for this weak analysis
Wow!! Madrid will win UCL without Ronaldo 👍🥰 the fanbois gonna be so salty 😅😅
I had Real 18/1 to win in ET. Doubt them at your peril.
This City lose really hurt these pundits 🤣🤣
From what I've seen , it would appear teams fear real Madrid and what they can do in the last half hour of a game !
Incrediblly an amazing team
I take a shot every time Moreno says Real Madrid
This could effectively open the door for Liverpool to pull off the Quadruple. Who knows how this defeat will affect City in the EPL with few games to go. I sense a slip up.
It's happened again , it's happened again, city bottling, it's happened again🗣🗣
Ancelloti is a genius and watch out Klopp.
Man City just joined PSG as the biggest bottlers in the Champions League.  PS : Grealish what a waste of money, and that too 100m off it.
Pep needs to learn how to park the bus. Klopp too
Comeback was real
After all this Real Madrid better wins the final, save the football world from a potential Liverpool quadruple.
Still not giving credit where it's due to RM. Typical ESPN pundits
Are you liverpool fans suree ya really rather play againts Madrid than City ? Yeah City a better team but surely you guys know them more Madrid Gonna spank ya watch 😂A Por la 14 KINGS OF EUROPE
The only advantage liverpool has is that the final is not at bernabeu xd
This is why we love the ucl
I'm still in disbelief. I've never been more hurt as a Man City fan
Please stop crying and admit that even half dead Real Madrid is far superior to your English clubs. Don’t be so over confident about Liverpool. Madrid will win that final too
This Mancity fanclub TV , who is your favourite to win champions League again? Mancity!!
Never ever underestimate the heart of a true CHAMPION!   Real have something that only a handful of teams have and that money cannot buy: Tradition, Pedigree and History. PSG and City do not have that.  Liverpool are the one team that can stop them as they do have tradition, Pedigree and History however, after what we’ve witnessed so far this season, it’d be FOOLISH to bet against Real, especially in the final. My head says Liverpool but my heart says Real and I have a feeling this will be the year of the heart.   Real are not my team but they deserve mad respect for what they’ve done this year despite all the odds. As a Milanista, I will be always cheering for Don Carletto.   Forza Carletto, Allez Karim! ⭐️⭐️⭐️
That’s why when a new player sign for Real Madrid the first thing they show him is the UCL trophies
a case study in complacency.
Real madrid made whole Espn fc crew wrong with their say
Stevie so salty...
I love that every single person on this show said city were going through! Never doubt MADRID BABY
Wat a game🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😈
These fckrs said madrid never gonna make it in your face!
Real Madrid just doesn't give up till the end Rodrygo literally came and gave a different kind of energy on the field ancelloti is brilliant he knows how to manage those young players
All pundits should learn that, "Never EVER RULE OUT REAL MADRID"
i dont know why chelsea is dragged into this conversation..they were 3-1 down in the 1st leg.Nobody expect them to go through..made a come back and even after the 2nd goal from real madrid they created chances..it's their inability to finish cost them the game..i don't think it's chokking
Real Madrid does not deserve to be in the final. They are a poor side with luck
These so called football pundits who have never experienced those moments in the field would never know about the spirit of Real Madrid. All the fans and players believed that Madrid would come back. This is Champions League.
Just think about it. Benzema has more CL trophies than the entire City team combined.   This group of RM players have the most successful CL careers in the entire history of the sport. They’re the pioneers of winning 3 in a row. That is 3 knockout tournament IN A ROW.   They still have most of the veterans and experienced players whose won it. Benz, Modric, Kroos, Marcelo, Casemiro and they can mould the young talents and guide them mentally.   It is a knockout tournament. It’s the focus for the 90 minutes that they’re good at. They have what it takes and they live by the competition. They’re the kings of Europe.
Well done Madrid,this was one of those great football ties of all time
Real Madrid are a team of focus, commitment and sheer will
Pep Bottle's it again 😂😂😂😂
Pep Guardiola is a joke. He will never win UCL. Also stop saying that Premier league is the best in the world. Most competitive, for sure. But that doesn’t guarantee quality.
Another big mistake was taking off all their best players. They had no way to get back in the game after it turned on them.
Camavinga was the game changer of this team!
What if city wins the league. Madrid wins the UEFA champions league and chelsea wins the FA cup. What happens to liverpool season then 😂😂😂 coz indeed tables turn
Yesterday ESPN's video title was "THE WHOLE ESPN CREW PREDICTS CITY TO WIN" ...🤭
This UCL season, any team who against Madrid, in truth fought against themselves. Madrid won only because they could hold on their nerves longer than their opponents.  If Madrid keep playing like that, all Liverpool needs to do is calm their nerves down, and Madrid wouldn't be a threat for them.  I'm Madridista. I applauded Madrid's determination and fighting spirit, but I'm ashame if that's the only thing they can bring to their games.
Did
Gabby looks so happy ! I know ESPN is an American channel but why do we have to suffer this anti English pundit commenting on the English game ?
I am proud to be a real madrid fan
Me as a Barca fan: Hala Madrid 😂
maybe only king of England can defeat king of spain  ...
This female presenter's name?
"PSG got slaughtered after their loss should City be slaughtered now?" " NO " 😂
Real deserves their 14th UCL as well as Ancelotti 4th UCL making him an all timer, if that happens he should retire theirs no better way to bow out
How are people surprised by the result? I couldn't imagine City going through
There isn't any way that Real deserved the win. Real got lucky and City has choked in recent years like no other team I can think of.
Cant listen to their baseless punditry anymore, they eat their own words after every madrid game but then make baseless claims against madrid again
Guordiola will never win Champions league with Man City cause he want to break there rule of soccer of not playing without a proper striker or Goalscore
Won some good betting money on that, thank you Real
Where is that loud mouth called Craig Burley, who's an avid Tuchel & Chelsea hater. He has been worshopping Pep & City throughout the season (which has rather been a very average season from their standard) & has been discrediting Chelsea & Tuchel despite they winning UEFA super cup, Club world cup and still being 3rd in the Premier League and have one more chance to add FA cup to their silverware this season against Liverpool. At least they won in Bernabéu & fought like lions to won the second leg despite the elimination. What has Manchester & Pep won all this season ? They haven't still won the PL and Liverpool are down their throat. Not just Burley, all these ESPN pundits look like they are City's PR agent. This is the worst possible title of this post match reaction video. The best title should have been " How on earth, have Manchester City bottled it again like every other year ? "
At this point RM is in a better position to win giving the path they took: PSG, Chelsea, and now ManCity. They were supposed to be bounced in the first round, yet here they are.
I know Real scored and did all that but I think this is a defeat for Man City opposed to a win for Real. Absolutely no mental toughness. They are too talented to not have won this tie. Also, not blaming grealish but come on, $100 mil and you come off the bench and two opportunities (sure they were tough) but come on. You gotta finish one of those. And how tf you gonna let little rodrygo slip in not once but TWICE to score.
4:30
Pep is the most overrated manager....he is a good manager with start studded players with a certain kind of style.
No one:  Ale Moreno: hhRhreal Madhrhhrid...
I ask before in the under 21 young player ranking go back and check......why rodrygo aint in it
The worst real madrid team ever but the best luck ever for a football team ever..luck saved the day for real madrid.
And the ESPN pundits were so sure that Madrid was going to lose...
"Paris were close"  "Chelsea were close" "City were very close" And Liverpool will even be more closer to beat real Madrid but none off them can stop madrid from wining their 14th champions league tittle 😂😂 Its just written in their DNA
These guys are too old
Real Madrid has dominated yesterday, what the heck are you saying????
Never seen a team this determined to win
Barcelona> Real Madrid
Lol from the first leg I knew that real would have won, have you guys watch there last few games?? Look who scored in those too 👀
Manchester city might have the most expensive players but Real Madrid have determined players so that is what Real Madrid for you.
Where is my boy Dan Thomas!
Stevie is just too salty at this point
Enough with Casemiro and a red card…whys no one talking about how Walker should’ve gotten a straight red card? Last man and shoves Vini with his arm and elbow
How do u guys call real as undeserving... Htf can u call them that.... U biased bunch of people
Bottle jobs again. Never mind throw another billion at it
Stevie are the only one who are trying to back Man City but they are sore losers in this tournament. I mean It doesn't matter what City does if they give up 2 TWO! goals in injury time 90mins!. That's absolutely abysmal defending and mentality from Man city. They deserves no praise after all those consistent loses in the past. Nedum gave the only credible analysis in this one. City are horrendous in 2nd legs of UCL performances recently and it was quite evident of it against Atletico Madrid. Stevie with his atrocious analysis better be careful Real Madrid is no Villarreal who did give Liverpool a major scare in the first half of the 2nd leg. Can't give Real those chances.
Calm down Stevie Liverpool was lucky against villarreal if they have gone in panic mood in the second half n came not pressing like they did in the first half
Ironically after one year you will recall this happened, I bet you will think “nooo wayyyy”. You will get amazed and then you think “ okay but now that won’t happen again “ and guess what Real Madrid will win the same way in last fifteen minutes. The king of combacks for a reason
These guys are paid to talk rubbish.  Vinni and Benz refused to put the ball on target.
Even Harry Maguire can defend better than Man City.
Rodrigo saves RM and they put Benzema picture in front page.. smh
wow. this was just wonderful man. and I don't think its anybody's fault. its just football.
Nice that for some hours the pundits will stop parroting the line that the Premier League is the best in the world. 'Two of the best clubs in the world'.
These guys talk such rubbish
Ale Moreno is a biased toss...
@ESPNFc Request to all the panelists, please hide yourself in a shelf...you all said Manchester City will win.... 😂😂😂😂What a panelists....all are Anti Madrid....where is Frank.....he may have resigned ... 😂😂😂😂
Karin Benzema diving like always.  No matter what city did the referee had an agreement with Florentino Pérez.
Steve is just polishing off his English team
If course Stevie doesn’t want to slaughter city because he’s biased to the premier league teams city deserves to be slaughtered from head to toe they suck spending all the money and still not winning the UCL
To be honest, City scoring that goal in the second half was actually bad for them rather than good because it was when Real Madrid woke up and decided to go all in
Lol why is no1 talking about the second penalty no called !
I dont think many people realize that Real have had home ties in the 2nd leg in all 3 of their matchups with PSG, Chelsea and City. Whereas liverpool are the only team this term to win all their away ties.  In a neutral venue, Liverpool will outclass Real Madrid.
Then why we are not admitting that vinicous Junior and Rodrigo are the two. Best, wingers
🤍🤍☄️
City need viagra, can’t get hard this season, they can only get semi’s it seems.
Anytime I see Gabby I get mad because he hated LIVERPOOL
Man City got Tebowed! LOL!
Kay looks amazing 💜💜
Next year will be Ronaldo's year
Man city should have got 2 goals. Atleast!! They didn't even try to get two goals. Played against how they play everyday
Give Pep Another chunk of that UAE money. Maybe we'll see something.   Well done to the REAL KINGS of Europe. Real Madrid. Well done to the best FC that has remained consistent in Europe - over the last 15 years or so,REAL MADRID
The worst thing you can do to Real Madrid is put their backs against the wall
Prem league kids can come cry and SMD now😂
This pundits are sore loosers. Always counts madrid out. Always eat their own words. REPEAT!
Not trying to be negative, but please get Alejandro Moreno out of there. He is making me not watch ESPN FC anymore.
No all English final! Thanks Real Madrid.
bunch of bullshits. Those English commentators always put epl over everything.
Pep never winning the UCL again, with City atleast. The African curse is real haha. All that money spent for nothing.
"There was no reason to believe"... bro they're Real Madrid they do this regularly..
The problem is everyone assumed Madrid was a one man team when they had Ronaldo while everyone else they had on the team was also a legend. These guys live for football 24/7. They are not hyped up youngsters. Vinny and Camavinga are miles ahead of Foden and Grealish. City get carried by KDB Mahrez and an unhappy Sterling. Madrid respect defending and don't just hope for Diaz to clear everything out. Madrids confidence isn't just from the name but the whole system and environment. They deserve so much more respect for winning two league titles since Ronaldo left but journalists act like its a bad thing for football if Madrid wins. Madrid has Benzema upfront and City has Jesus and yet City has the "better" team.  They'll win another champions league if Ronaldo goes back for at least 2 yrs.
Don't underestimate  Luck..... Unbelievable lucky. But you create and look for luck.  88 minutes Manchester City played flawlessly.  6 minutes disaster..... I mean the second goal asencio touches the ball and Rodrigo scores.... Talk about luck.... Mendy clearing goal line and hitting a city player doesn't go in. Mahrez first leg hits post foden hits Carvahal, I mean Talk about streak of Luck. But 1 thing to remember  Luck runs out also. So go Liverpool......I hope Jurgen klopp team blows away Madrid....
The way they talk about RM as they are nobody it's unbelievable... BYE!
So i guess everyone forgets that Casemiro’s two yellow card fouls on KdB & Foden Which goes unscathed didn’t alter the game in a way. If he is gone and Real is playing 10 v 11 then this game is different. These no calls once again @ the Bernabeu proves again that the home team gets preferential treatment
Another Champions league from Madrid
I am so happy that Real Madrid went through and deservedly so. I am so happy that this slapped Stevie on his face who has underestimated Real a lot. I really dislike Stevie. He is so cocky and arrogant. I pray to God that Real win the CL!!
Steve Nicol still trying to downplay Madrids Victory lol
Brah who are you gonna say they did nothing in the first 90 minutes. They pressured city. If vini wasn fouled in the back two times and hadnt had a horrific first touch he could have scored 3 on his own
Get Moreno off please. He and the two Scotsmen that live in the past but think they know football better than the fans of teams that support them, they are assholes who's job's seem to be all about being polarizing and biased towards certain English teams. And as for ESPN, the late great Kobe once said of them "I've known for a long time that they are a bunch of idiots"
Kdb sub off  ...  another Pep managerial brain fart ???  Discuss
Save UCL semi final second legs. STOP THE UCL NEW FORMAT!
After  Benzema scored the panenka at the Etihad the way he smiled and celebrated it was like he knew they were going through. These pundits talk as if Madrid did not make mistakes which the opposition did capitalize    in but on the night where it counted, Real Madrid wanted it more.
The guy said  about man City was right having African omen twice failed to Win uefa
Where are the other hyenas? Yesterday they all said Man City will be the team to advance.....they're hidden somewhere? Hahaha 😆
Rodrigo MOST clutch player in the world right now. Real Madrid with the best fighting and mentality spirit in the world right now, as a Barca fan after these 3 comebacks, they WILL win the UCL again.
English commentators always crying because it's not a English final 🤣🤣
ESPN analysts have no credibility. All of them just the other day had City going through. Look at them now. And Craig went to bed after this.
I wonder what the British pundits excuses will be now lol. Liverpool shall be a great game hopefully.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is real madrid. This is what we do
My friends; the sequel was better than the original. ESPN,What did you say would happen??
Never rule out Madrid for the trophy until when they're gone!!! Never underrate Madrid when they're still competing!!!
Madrid bought the ref over.  Fake team and fake trophy
Choke city
Camavinga
Camavinga was superb
Real Madrid just need 5 minutes additional time to win the game, no matter how good the rivals.
Real madrid and Liverpool history  kicks on
This is hard to Mancity, this is football!! Anything can happen, that's why in game like these against big teams City really need a proper striker
Football is not about ball position but the 3 points and that is what Real Madrid believe in never underestimate this team.
ManCity, vtc, desperdiçar uma desvantagem dessas 🤦‍♂️😠
Steve trying so hard to not give credit to real madrid...
But wasn't Kevin THE most confident person heading into the 2nd leg
Everyone already writing Madrid off for the Final
There is no reason why..Mahrez and Foden can’t play 120 min.. end Benzema can..????
I'm glad City lost that way KDB won't get all the praise.
I think it would be more difficult for Liverpool now than it would have been against City. Real Madrid is not playing well, yes but something spiritual is carrying them along. Chelsea member based in Qatar and CEO of Fawzaan Sports on YouTube
This cast should be called the Real Madrid haters FC .
Real Madrid believed they could do the impossible. Manchester City feared the inevitable.. wooooow, unbelievable I don't want to say God's of Football did it. It's like all this UCL is all about R.M against EPL giants imagine from Chelsea,Man City and Liverpool in the final
I have a feeling madrid will beat liverpool
Stevie looks like he's gonna cry
I agree with the guy and blame City as a team. This has actually started at Etihad a week ago. In fact,  starting back  Jan.  City do not show a good fighting spirit and will to achieve the deserved results. They should have nailed down that victory at Etihad  a week ago with a minimum 3 goal advantage as they have had all the opportunities in the world. Just ending that game with one goal advantage provided  RMA with a big boost in optimism and hope.  Knowing that, City should have been mentally  better prepared  for today's match to finish off the job. Instead, they have been rather soft and somewhat incoherent again. I do not think that RMA will get that lucky in Paris. Instead, LFC  is rather lucky to have their second UCL cup within a touch. This is a very unfortunate unfolding of events and a big blow for Pep. Will he stay?
I’m confused, everyone is talking about the chances city missed but no one talking about the chances we created and missed also. They’re acting like were weren’t doing anything until the point where Mahrez scored
If away goals counted Madrid would have been thru in 90 minutes
The propaganda from this commentator panel was so apparent....never gave them a chance..
When you are leading by a goal playing Real Madrid, all the more you got to play like its your final match of your life. Real Madrid is really a relentless side and I fear for my team in the final 3 weeks later
Stevie is acting as if Real Madrid is a small club whom Liverpool can easily go through. Its UCL final and Real Madrid is the king of UCL. His so called liverpool will be thrashed by Real Madrid. Just wait.
You can clearly tell these espnfc are barca fans. They are not happy madrid advanced . HALA MADRID !!!
Thank you for not believing in Madrid ESPN FC crew
The only people that thought Madrid were dead after the first leg were probably english, city fans or Madrid haters.
Steve Nicol misses the point here ,he says  certain little things gone against City tonight , but doesn't give credit to Real for their unbelievable character to come back from the dead & hit back with the killer blow ....They ve done it already time & time again against so called more talented teams because of their mental strenght & belief to get the job done .I fancy them against Liverpool & of course he'll write them off as usual
Referee was bribed
I'd love to give respect to Madrid for winning but some of the referees decisions were questionable
let the other guy speak for christs sake
Running scared Stevie about real facing your Liverpool instead of city
When Real Madrid it’s the “football gods”, i think at this point you got consider the mentality part of Real Madrid. It’s undeniable that they have something else then just say it’s “football gods”
how dumb are these english pundits? You don't get lucky 3 times in a row. you don't win the league by 15 points with luck. or the gods smiling on them. they had a plan and they play by that plan the entire 90 minutes. if you switch off in the 85th minute, then how do you consider your coach and players to be world class? i mean Liverpool is the only team i support in the PL, but why are they the favorites against THIS Madrid side. this is the champions league final. the team has several players who won it at least 4 times in the last decade. they have some stunning young players with terrific skills. and remember, a third of their team are forgotten players (bale, hazard etc.). and yet they won the league by a big margin and knocked out the super rich 3 (chelsea, psg and man city). and still for these pundits, they are not favorites? gimme a break!
5:40 "Nothing Logical"
wow didnt call this happening..
These pundits keep given excuses for Pep failure; I bet if it’s Mourinho; they will have slaughtered him 😀
Experience won tonight and Experience will prevail again in the final
The referee helped Real Mad. Twice first goal Benzema was offside the penalty was faked by Benzema . People always never point to the bias .
Mancity bottling as always 😂😂😂
Remember Chelsea winning the champions league against all odds... There is something about champions league called magical
Only Liverpool can beat real madrid....
No one talking about carvajal one of the best today
What these guys fail to mention is that in Benzema, Madrid have had the best player in each game apart from the PSG game. In Modric they've had the best midfielder (maybe Thiago will change that) and in Vinicius they have one of the top 5 or top 3 players in the pitch. This is why they always have spells of dominance regardless of how a game has gone
My goodness, Karim's first goal assist and insane nerves of steel with the penalty, he deserves much more respect from the media than he is given.
Don't forget the ref too?
I like how Ale (or Spaniards in general) say Real Madrid. As if they have bitten their tongue 😄
The Greatest investment Real Madrid did in 21st century is Kroos Modric Casemiro
Lol these guys have done it again. Whenever they predict one team to win it always goes opposite. Has happened so many times. 😂
No one is going to give Anceloti credit? He lost Ramos, Varane, has a mediocre bench with Bale, Isco, Hazard yet he has taken the best out the young ones in the team
It's on the players. Not Pep
It proved again yesterday that current Man city, players are not good enough for Pep, to win the UCL, & we won't make the same mistakes like Man City, did in the Semifinal against RM, in the Final on 28 May, Ynwa! 🏆🤞
Not a fan of real madrid, nothing against them. I'm just tired of all these epl fanboys always acting like the English league is the only one that matters.
Footballing Gods are doing justice by eliminating the oil money clubs
I told you against Chelsea Madrid had believe that they are the best team in the world... Champion’s insist
Hala Madrid... It's time you stop saying opponents are poor and start giving Madrid the credit they deserve 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don Carlo's masterclass! 🙌 Pep is not the best coach in football, but i agree his football is one of the most attractive like Klopp's & Wenger's.
I have seen only Barcelona demonstrate the ability to kill the will of Real Madrid
If city took those chances in the 1st leg it would not came down to this. All players have responsibility for the team, not just the defence
Too much English bias from all of you now you can’t acknowledge your disrespect towards the kings of Europe 🤦🏾‍♂️ city haven’t won the champions league to be so often considered favourites to win it 🤷🏾‍♂️
these clown will never question city or liverpool cause for some reason this epl agenda is mad strong. PSG absolutely toyed with madrid for 135 mins but they were just berating poch and the PSG players but now chelsea and city aren't to be blamed cause they had "individual errors". PSG played way better than the 2 english teams but the clownery of ESPN can't see that and won't even touch pep's bald head
To be safe,  liverpool will be happy to be underdogs because anytime another team is deemed "favourites" against madrid they lose.  Cmon liverpool 👏 💪
Truly horrific analysis from the panel here
Moreno, Tone it down For god’s sake
i cant fathom how rodrygo’s name isn’t in the title. super sub that came in and saved the game, amazing from him 😄
The turning point was defiantly substituting Mahrez in a moment when he was good in the game ⚠️
Man City conceded 6 goals over the two legs... they don't get to complain about being out.
Hahaha real madrid has the last laugh.... No one gave them a chance... ESPN gave us no chance
Everyone is talking about peps  ucl record  post barca and rightfully so but what about mourinho and this madrid side. I know it's slightly   differnt now from the one he had in 2013 when carlo first inherited it f but since he left two differnt managers have reached more than one European final with madrid whilst he didn't make a single one
The entire espn crew rode off Madrid, I’ve been right more times than them at this point😂 even now look at them they trying use their “logic” to make excuses lol
Never doubted Madrid this season is for the history books
Real Madrid 100% doping. Someone investigate them!
I feel like Real Madrid give other teams false hope making them think they have a chance at winning then absolutely decimate and destroy them, their hope, and everything else
These type of games are why I love football.
Casemiro has a successor ...Camavinga Kroos has a successor ...Ceballos Modric has a succesor ...Valverde
Ale is a walking embarrassment as a pundit. More so than he was as a player. That is a true achievement. Probably his only one.
The football gods HATE Pep Guardiola, and they stick needles in his eye in the worst moments.
It's all against Real Madrid this season, all wanted Real Madrid to lose
@Espn fc crew: can we say you guys always keep bottling it with your favorites to win the CL where you always put Man city ahead of every club? My ghosh!!🤣🤣😅😅
Franco's era lives on
no rabonas
We have the luxury to look back and see what every club did WRONG against Real. I have every confidence that Kloopo will get it right come game day!! 💪🔴🔴
Welcome Zinédine Zidane to MAN CITY, Pep Retired‼️✔️
Madrid has pedigree no amount of bankrolling to the City & PSG's of this world can equate to that
I believe having casemiro’s fouling helped
Secretly all espn members hate real Madrid
Why are most sportshow hosts female these days? Watchout the oppressing!
This City side simply does not have fight in them. I highlight here, LaPorte. A player that quickly changed nationality when he could not get into the French team, or is it him pretending to take a knock from a significantly smaller guy in Modric.
Game was rigged casimro fouls from behind twice not a card. Sterling fouls gets ball yellow card. 95 min pen yeah no way it wasn’t rigged.
At this point, ESPN FC pundits = clowns 🤡
Man City -- fragile mentality. Not mentality monsters like both RM and Liverpool.
RM doesn’t stop fighting
But did Pep get outsmarted by Carlo Ancelotti? City thought that after Modric, Kroos and co get subbed that they're done. But Carlo then bought on players to speed up the game knowing that City had expended plenty of energy. He's a wily coach that has beat Klopp with Napoli in the past .. its hard to fathom that other big clubs in England bypassed his services. Although Casimero got away with plenty in that first half .. playing at home has its advantages.
I believed….they were gonna come back. SO MANY YEARS….y’all KNOW RM will always find a way
Oil money on their hands, too much slippery they can’t get hold on to UCL trophy somehow 😂😂
Crazy to think that Ancelotti took a youth team (mostly) to a UCL final
Bias panel criticized psg but didn’t do same for Chelsea n city , they forget that the is no other club like Real Madrid, they re the best club in the world ,
Steve scared
english reporters looking shocked 🤣🤣🤣
Real Madrid has a pedigree that will shine at any time... no matter how many generations pass... the lineage will eventually produce a winning Thoroughbred... and Real Madrid is a Thoroughbred sooner or later... early...Hala Madrid CABRONES...
City can't see a game through, but remember they all count real Madrid out😂😂😂
REALLY CAN WE JUST MENTION MENDI AND HIS GOAL LINE SAVE...PLEASE
Just a week ago, y’all said they couldn’t do it against City and… here we are
Vinicius is going to be huge problem for liverpool cus we know  how vulnerable the Liverpool's fullbacks are when it comes to defending...
PSG, Chelsea, Mancity still these so called Pundits don't understand what Real Madrid is. 2 top English teams down and now Liverpool is next. They didn't do nothing in first 90mins he said, they don't need 90mins they simply don't. Took 20-25 mins to bring PSG down, few minutes to bring Chelsea down, same goes for Mancity. Cry all you want.
Kane was missed.-)
RM don't deserve it...
How the rebuilding Real Madrid team won the most dangerous club in the past 2 years under Pep within 2 minutes?. The answer is very easy and that is what we known as Identity and DNA.  The case is close
The xG for Real Madrid was way better than City so stop this nonsense about City dominating Madrid.
Man City bottled it, Real didnt win it. Left a bad taste in my mouth, the better team lost today.
When Pep subbed Grealish and Zen on I think it’s when it all went down hill. They completely switched the entire left side of the field and proceeded to get dominated on that side.
ESPN FC panel finding excuses for Man City is ridiculous . Still Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest asking Man City where is your Champions League trophy ? Kane watch out this City team is just bottlers.
Sheer Luck .. fluke & black magic ... Casemiro should have been sent off .
Why is Gabs hair green? LFC 3 RM 1.
Sometimes I think this show is script because how City doesn't deserve to be slaughtered? They had a 2-0 lead at the 89th minute. Chelsea got slaughtered when they lost to Madrid the last round. City and Pep has spent more than 1Billion and you want to sugar-coated and say "players make mistake". I'm sorry but city have 3 players in the top 10 highest paid in PL, their coach is the highest paid and they missed tons of chances 1st and 2nd leg, all the Espn fc put them as favorites at the beginning once again so we need to hold someone accountable. That was unacceptable. What else they need to do to deserve slaughtered?. I don't even know why they brought Nedum on because it sounds all excuses from a sore losers. He never gave credit to RM.... Can't stand these "pundits" 🤢
That’s right haters!! The game isn’t over until the whistle is blown. Let’s gooooooo! Hala Madrid!!!
I really cannot stand Steve nicole! Pls give me a life if u agree! He seems like such a big Madrid hater!!!!
Exactly he got it It's VUDU, BLACK MAGIC
Y’all pundits are haters
Wow so many haters in one table..lol
I need therapy 😓
Congratulations to Liverpool for wining the champions league 👏 very well deserved
God forbid anyone ever criticizes city. United will win a game and still will get stick from these pep sycophants.
People fail to realize that Real played so much better and more dangerously after Rodrygo and Camavinga came on. They changed the game. They won because they played very well after being scored on. It’s not just a miracle. City has 30’ to win it back and couldn’t. It shows.
yk what though the final doesnt have 2 legs which means no second leg comeback
Steve a hater
Premier league made Man City to comfortable. So they lost
Bald headed Guardiola strikes again. He cant win the Champions League without Messi. Sack him and bring in Ancelotti if City wants to win the Champions League 😂
These commentators are so BIAS that is shameful. They can not admit that Real Madrid is better team than the English teams.
blah blah blah.... Just Cut the BS Excuses and Kneel to the king of Europe👑 Hala Madrid 👑
They will and can keep doing it. it's belief and faith
If Man City had Pogba they would have gone through
Biggest Dump Mr Stevie Nicol. We will beat Liverpool in the Final.
Curtios is the hero
These clowns didn't give real Madrid a chance in the entire tournament. They didn't gave it in 2016,17&18. Real clowns
Another year another pep team unable to finish clinical chances.  Could’ve had it done in the first leg but nooooooo Could’ve had it done in this second leg but noooo Pep needs to be sacked. There’s no excuse to lose a lead like that.
Man City was hailed as the number 1 favorite to win the UCL this year, the same way as in prior seasons and once again they managed to bottle it completely with all their billions in oil money. You love to see it.
GBP 160 for Kane now looks like a bargain. Clearly city lack their own Benzema. Spending on Grealish was wasteful and not strategic
Real Madrid is a team made for champions league . Psg can buy 100 other good players but they still won’t win the champions league.
someone please get Stevie a laxatif or something he is constipated in the brain.
chokers City... how did this happen
Get Stevy off this channel .... this man City team should of easily won this game. Pep and his ego got the best of him again.... why are you even bringing sterling on after 90 min? Come on..... Get stevie off the show and bring a new fresh air
That is what Real Madrid are all about and that is their DNA when they play in this competition but this time,they just came back from being behind in their last three knockout rounds of this season's UEFA Champions League,good friends!!!I think they will repeat their history over Liverpool in the final like how they have inflicted on them four years ago,good friends!!!:-D
Never score 1st against Real Madrid that is the mantra. Klopp watch out 😂
Was just waiting to see these guys reaction after they all thought City will win 💀💀🤡
Both the semifinals have shown......along with playing football u need that mentality
Ref sold the game. Cannot tell me otherwise
Never a penalty. Same as the first leg.
The only issue I have with this Real Madrid victory is that Casemiro didn’t get a single yellow card the first half for two yellow card tackles the ref let slide
These pundits are clown. 20 minutes of babbling of "magic", " luck", " I don't know how", but no complement for Rodrygo for his brilliant finishing , or the performance of camavinga. It's nothing new, the same idiotic comments they made when RM were winning 4 UCL's in 5 year.
Stevie is weird with analysis 😂
How are people saying madrid was out played when even pep said they were out played...  Both vini and benzema missed great chances omg!
Best club in the history of the game!!!! HALA MADRID!! 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
The winner of this CL will have a Balon d'Or winner. Salah, Mane & Bezema are a lock for top 3. Btw Nkunku should be top 5-10. Mbappe, De Bruyne, Courtouis and Nkunku should be in the top 10. You might even add Vinicius to round that 10 up.
Lets not get carried away here. Real madrid scored 2 goals in 1 minute.  Their only shots on target. And One of those was literally a double header. (Extremely lucky.) In a final vs Liverpool they will suffer BADLY. And I expect them to lose by 2 or 3 goals. (Maybe more.)  Man city could’ve killed them in th first leg, but were very very very wasteful. Then, chelsea almost knocked them out FROM A 0-3 LEAD.   So congratulations to madrid, but the facts are there. Extremely easy for them to concede goals.  I do hope they win it though
Been saying for a long time that this whole panel needs changing
This is why  I watch football.
Benzema is at his peak… literally on fire…
I should never know or be right that Madrid could win this game especially when we have experts advising me ! Come onnnnnn!!!!
Benzema golden ball
The mentality monsters face off in the final. Liverpool v Real Madrid, can't wait for it.
And this Real Madrid team is getting Mbappe, Rudiger and possibly even Paul Pogba😳😳😳😳
Why psg should be slaughtered but man city shouldn’t , they both bottled it  🤷🏾‍♂️I guess some people are just bias
Man City are a bunch of bottle merchants in Champions league like PSG
When other teams lose its the player's but when City lose it's Pep😂😂beautiful logic.
This is why I watch foorball.
Then rodriguo scored a big goal then he scored another big goal which is the same team u ruled out
How Madrid was outplayed in this match? Didn't u see the opportunities they created throughout the game? Seems like we didn't watch the same match. And u pundits keep talking about controlling the game, when one team controls the game it makes football boring , both team played well but I give real Madrid the edge in this one... yall need to stop talk bruh hate yall shitty talk
it's about belief same as in life if you believe the how is none of your business.  well done Real Madrid 👏
Sack the whole espn panel! That's what it comes too.
For all you Barcelona fan , HALA MADRID!!  And the person that said we were dead take that
Real Madrid did not play terrible.  Why are they saying that City dominated the match?
It's a shame ESPN FC crew still won't give Real Madrid their flowers. When will you lot learn. Real Madrid in a champions league final 😂😂good luck to Liverpool you gonna need it. Origi won't save you this time.
I just hope Manchester United players are watching all that. This is how you fight for your team.
Real madrid believe they are better than everyone, that is why they keep winning.
So glad City continues their curse lol
Everyone on this show & the entire world bet on city and then what 😂😂😂
No one is praising Ancelotti how odd !!!
It don't matter how they did it it's not luck first was psg this years favorite , then last year's champions then the so called best team in the world ..... Next probably Liverpool again
Biased ref. The CL is rigged.
We all know if Man City would have won the song would have been Pep Pep Pep Pep the genius Pep the god of all coaches I think we should all give Ancelotti his prop
Maybe in 9 games out of 10 city can won vs real but the thing is only in most important stage finals of league champions they bottled again and again 😏
I love a good comeback, and I rarely say thing, but they really did not deserve to win. City were by far the better team, out played them in both legs. But, hey, that's football. Anything can happen.
ESPN panelists still saying that it was luck 🤣🤣🤣 the shear hatred they have for Real Madrid is unbelievable 😅
The football God is with madrid...against  psg, Chelsea and man city ....I just hope Liverpool punish them...I can't stand real Madrid...I don't know how one team can be this lucky...they aren't winning because they are better than any of the team they beat...it is a total luck...to score on the last minute against Chelsea and man city
I am for Liverpool but mother of all GOD is with Real Madrid now. We'll fight it.
This is why we watch football games that unfavourable Real Madrid trashed so called PSG, Chelsea & City; and the underdog Villareal made it to quarter final having a chance to equalize agregat 2-2 in firt half.
I agree with Stevie, they game away 2 penalties over two legs.. both shocking defensive lapses, that was the game
Look at Gab, looks so angry😂😂😂. Can't bear the pain
Steve just a hater
We as Real Madrid supporters never lost hope for a single moment we're always backed the team the team knows it they done it
Liverpool will lose miserably
Ali twerking to Real Madrid is nauseating, control yourself mate 🤮
They get what they deserve not paying 150 million for harry kane the best striker in all england history
My god plz replace Ale Moreno Only a loud and annoying analyst 😂
I disagree that Real Madrid didn’t do anything during these 90 mins. They defended well against possibly the best tactical team in the world. They fought and took the game until the last instance, sure it wasn’t pretty but not many teams aside from Liverpool can stay alive against city in 90 mins let alone 180 mins. City was not comfortable the whole game, they didn’t risk as much as they usually do because they knew madrid was capable of a lot at the counter. They controlled the game but they never felt truly in control of the score line.
I Love This Team
Everytime Camavinga comes on they start to play better
Look MC did punish Madrid when they could have So that's what happens when u leave real Madrid a live
Pep Fraudiola strikes again!
Jules is somewhere out there probably screaming "Karim The Dream".😂👌🏽
Let's hear what they have to say now realmadrid benzima vinicius rodgygo
I think RM are destined to win this year's CL. There's no logical reason they should be in the final yet here they are. Great never say die attitude and a great story for the ages. But this side SHOULD HAVE been done and dusted THREE separate times already. They were outplayed by PSG over two legs, outplayed by Chelsea and now City. Yet they have pulled a rabbit out of the hat and produced miracles each time. Liverpool are once again the objectively better side and SHOULD win. But I think RM will do the unthinkable again and will win despite being outplayed. Sometimes the best sides don't win the competition. Luck comes into play sometimes, and this year's RM has all the luck on their side. At this point it's destiny.
Steve does not know football
Delusion at it's finest LOL
These pundits are just running their mouths, and they never learn
I usually said it here, you guys shouldn’t rate Real Madrid out.
These pigs are still alive !!!!
This man over thinks too much. Why do you do such changes. Take out your key players who are making it difficult for Madrid and bring in players who are not consistent. He bottled it ones again.
Chicken lil seems a bit worried they’re not playing city in the final……
I hope the ESPN pundits pick Mariad to win the final, coming from a Liverpool fan.
FROM NOW ON STOP PREDICTING "FOOTBALL" BASED ON PAST RESULTS. Hala! Real de Madrid 👑
I saw the 4-3 match at Etihad. I knew then that if Madrid were able to score that many goals (in spite of the loss), somehow they would find a way to make a comeback at their own stadium, no matter what.
Pep made some shocking substitutions he thought they were playing Aston Villa, you can't switch off like that
Madrid scored 6 goals over 2 legs but City is the superior team? Football is becoming a joke if you listen to these guys all day.
Wow the hate in this section from the plastic RM fans towards the pundits. People forget that they are pundits, not soothsayers. If you Muppets were so confident of RM reaching the finals, you should have bet your houses on it... I bet no one did that eh? It's easy to have benefit of hindsight... Absolute Muppets most of you lot here. Congrats to RM btw... Omg the look on those oil club plastic fans was worth it 😂
This is pathetic, ESPN slaughtered PSG but not Man City for practically the same thing. PSG was more dominant over Madrid than Man City was overall. Get these biased brits out of here
Incredibly horrible game management by city by all simple means
It was just fear from man city same as it used to be when playing against  man u years ago
I hate that they act like Madrid didn’t create chances. Benzema missed an easy header. Vinny missed 3 great chances. Modric terrible touch cost a great chance. They were getting chances but were wasteful. More than just the box score of shots on target stat
Liverpool had one bad half and they were hammered. Why City can't or shouldn't be hammered after giving up such a lead? Continously letting Madrid back in to the game
Tactical masterclass by guardiola. Well done.
Imagine your team, in a match like this. The Champions League Semi Final! Then at 90 minutes because you weren't winning at the time, its acceptable to walk out of the stadium. Anyone who can't applaud your teams efforts at the end of a match is no fan.
If Vini had a few better touches in and around the city box, this could have been a way different story from the pundits. Things just weren't falling for him.
Belize central america I'm from and I'm a Real Madrid fan but i have huge respect for Manchester city & get ready Paris Madrid is coming
I love how Salty steve is... We gonna destory your Liverpool and make you cry
14:00 Sir, have you seen all city's first 3 goals in the 1st leg? 3 of 4 city goals were literally defensive mistakes.
Stevie lied. The 2nd half it was all Real in the first 10mins. Vinicius got alot of chances but because of a poor first touch in the final third made him lose the chances.
No mention of Nacho and Militao is sickening. They dropped a great performance and played with nothing but passion for that badge.
Of course they DESERVE to be slaughtered Stevie, you'd NEVER admit to that, because you're opinion is almost ALWAYS against Real Madrid!  "When" this Liverpool team wins 4 champion league in 5 years then and only then can even remotely make ignorant and arrogant statements like u continously make on this show.
Mancity goalkeeper made 2 mistakes
The love the expected goal stat and failed to mention Madrid had 2.65 vs 1.57 City. Games are until the ref blows the whistle. Magic happened at the Bernabeu again.
Hala.....Hala.....Hala....Hala ... Madrid , I told you guys that championship league is my Madrid birth right .this is why I will die for Madrid forever ❤️
why is this guy Stevie so salty . just give me props ffs
I’m a Barca fan but RM today was so determined! They don’t let nerves get to them!
Steve seems worried its not Man City
The Big Benze ⚔️
HALA MADRIDDD
This entire panel had Madrid in the shadows except a little hope by Ale. Shaka in particular never sees good from Madrid.  Stevie you have wished for the worst, to say you prefer Liverpool play Madrid instead of Man City. You always favor the English clubs.
PSG and M. city are small Clubs; small mentality and Teams. money can´t buy history;can´t buy shirt
How can you not heavily criticise City and criticise PSG? PSG were in complete control and were undone by individual errors.
That’s not actually true. Real Madrid played well in first half. We just couldn’t score because Benzema was little off. Second half we were really terrible until RODRYGO came on. Hala Madrid 😍💪
Real Madrid will beat Liverpool in the FINAL Liverpool is the next to feel the WRATH of Real Madrid it's to be Real Madrid 3-2 Liverpool
There are 2 person in the history of Football is Saved over and over and over and Hyped to the Greatest is Messi and Pep... But the Actual history is they are not that great as Media guys describe them as... They both are one of biggest chokers.. They may play football which these people like but it doesn't matter.... It's like you are having beautiful handwriting doesn't mean you are no 1 in studies.. You need to score no 1 mark to get that.. same in Football it's not about way you play... It's about winning
some club born to be  champions and others to mad  the journey fun  !
Ancelotti  just showed who the best coach in the world is. Anyone who says it is Guardiola should put his foot in his mouth. The better team shut down mentally. The best coach is the one who can win with a weaker team that is down game after game and come back everytime. Ancelotti is the best coach ever.
Hasta el final, vamos real.,lo lo lo lo
These guys are so butthurt lol
who has made this aljendro a pundit. he is such a biased man
Im a barca fan but madrid made one of the best comebacks an i was suporting dem nice game
After 90 minutes 2 points ahead you kill the match. Bring substitutions, create somme death moments to ensure the victorie.
There is a difference between better team and a great team. For y’all out there overpowering your premier league… a great team is that team that never stop believing and they punish any single mistake from the opponent. No one else does better than Real Madrid. If you blame PSG, Chelsea then do the same to Man City! Or give a credit to Real for being a great team.
1 - Real was not completely dominated by Man City today.  2 - Real having a history of overturning games was in city players and manager’s minds 3 - City also have a history of panicking when in the UCL  4 - guys come one we have Benzema, Courtois a ballon d’or winner in Modric and very talented youngsters like Camavinga, Valverde and Rorygo  This is not luck or surreal. Real know that their strength is talent, belief in themselves, a history of coming back from the dead, an opponent used to panicking and a strong core of players used to winning the UCL.
La liga is still on top!  Villarreal eliminated  Bayern, Juve and Man U in the Europa League finals. Villarreal ranked 7 😆  Real Madrid eliminated PSG, Chelsea and Man City.   Hala Madrid!
The English bias in ESPN is crazy. The better team won, period. How's nobody talking about Benzema, Vini, and Modric's missed chances? Glad that this isn't another all English final.
*Real Madrid Champion League Gods*
HAHAHAHA these clowns wrong again. When will they learn that Real Madrid are unstoppable
Stevie is actually dumb idk what game he watched today. Madrid was the better team today and the better team won. They were knocking on the doors since kickoff. The only reason that city got that Grealish chance was because Madrid was pushed up trying to get an equalizer. Benzema Vini and Modric all had chances in the first half to score and same at the beginning of the second half. Saying that they looked like they weren't going to score is way too harsh, they wasted plenty of chances too.
Man city have been considered the favorites to win the UCL for how many years now  ?
Very nice points but the comparison to basketball was definitely false. Basketball games are just as cometative if not more because it isn't as hard to put up points on the board so if when even a single player gets hot for 2-3 minutes, you can turn the tides of a game. No deficit is too big there compared to football.
Rodrygo is a young BEAST.
Stevie protecting English football 😂😂😂
Why doesn't it make sense!? Real Madrid played better on the last 40 mins of the game and won.
The win is completely logical. If you don't give up, you still have a chance. Especially when you're team is filled with winners like RM.
Manchester City and the coach are a bunch of bottle merchants. What is that...like 6 seasons on the bounce of crashing out of UCL? ...AND Pep still hasn't won a UCL without Messi, Xavi, and Iniesta. But he's spent millions upon millions to no avail. 🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼
Did you mean 'Rodrygo & Co.'
Bale practicing his bicycle kicks
HALA MARDRID...THE END!!!!!!!!!!!
I TOLD U ALL THAT MANCHESTER CITY CANNOT MANAGE THE BIG STAGE THEY R STAGE FRIGHT I'M GLAD LIVERPOOL GET THEIR REVENGE REVENGE REVENGE REVENGE LIVERPOOL GOING TO TEACH THEM A LESSON
Next year city..🤣🤣🤣🤣
Logic?? What logic...Madrid is defying logics n it pains my heart as a Barca fan
Real Resurrection Hala Madrid 🤍🤍
Guardiola should go to manage PSG: the perfect pair 🙂
This real Madrid team is pure class
I feel like city needs a squad change. New players in the team to change the culture. This is going to be a mental block for them
Man. City was comfortable in the game but thats not all scoring goals are winning a game
ESPN pundits are the worst… you all wrote us off 😅😅😅😅… I don’t want to hear anything from you guys again. Focus on hockey
I'm sorry, liverpool fans would have preferred City in the final than Madrid. Reason, it's because they have had the better of them this season and know how to win against them. Now Liverpool are worried, because they will be playing a team that does not give up and fighters. Not saying liverpool wont win, but I have a feeling that they are concerned now about this team.
Can we hear pundits that dont cry about Reals greatness...its pathetic now
Ancelotti deserves none of the credit for this. They had a terrible 2 legs. It's purely down to the players pulling out a Miracle.
Should have bring Sterling in instead of Jack. Mahrez Jesus and Sterling should have been on the pitch to sustain the attack after Man City goal.
Real Madrid's xG was 2.6 to City's 1.29. madrid created enough chances today
I was the only one in my office who knew if there was any team that could come back from this is Real Madrid
Farmers League  club killed best club in EPL?!?! I think its time to stop saying ‘EPL is the best league in the world!’
The minute Rodrygo scored the second goal, Pep knew he lost. His body language says it all. He sat back and wrapped his arms around himself.
Nah if it wasn’t for Rodrygo there would be no final 🇧🇷
Madrid dint have a shot on target but vinicius had the best chance in the game and real had better chances overall even if the were not shots on target… this people look at numbers and not the actual plays.
And everyone in Spain the night before at half time was sure Villarreal would knock out Liverpool as well.
8:07 AND? Last time they played most of City goals were thanks to Varane and Carvajal. I didn´t hear any "expert"  acknowledge it. Mistakes are a HUGE part of football.
"We can play much much worst than we played and we can win".........................................Greatest ever manager.
Pep thought it was over. Man played Fernandino to give him a birthday gift for his 37th Well he'll never forget tonight . All you analysts were WRONG. MADRID DO NOT DANCE TO YOUR DRUM. WE DO OUR OWN THING BABY
madridismo is a tactic on its own
English paper headlines: Farmers stun Pep!! 🤣
Not about history, Madrid were lucky, deflection on cross that hit rodrygo's head, City had chances, lucky lucky Madrid🍻
If City had score 2 goals.  Real Madrid would have scored 4 goals.  The ratio was to be 3:1, 4:2, 6:3
Benzema and Vinicus had 2 clear chances each, the matter that they didn´t go between the 3 post doesn´t take away the clear chances they were. Shooting straight to the keeper is not a chance at all, and those were many of the "excellent chances" City had.
If this was PSG we would be kiiling them so Stevie can miss me with that
Stevie 🤦‍♂️
Pep is not winning a dime champions league with Man City. Why why why??? Over thinking in a game that you already win. Greelish is a low standard player and he is not fit to play such magnitude game. Why Pep changed KDB and Mahrez. This is so so so stupid of Pep. Dias is not in good form after his injury. Laporte is slow for the pace of this game. Stone would have been better with Dias.
Real has Benzema and a very deep bench to sustain the team through the last minute. If Benzema doesn't score, it give an opportunity to a bench player to shine. Imagine if Hazard was healthy coming off the bench. The team is very deep and the legacy they have to carry pushes them to the max.
Congratulations to Real Madrid! Real Madrid can be Champion this May! Good Luck!
Lol
I'm sure Pep is dreading that 1st leg result now. Madrid should have been dead and barried in that game. And to underestimate Madrid knowing what they did to PSG and Chelsea. You can't take things lightly.  In a way I blame Pep and The players themselves.
I just don’t understand these so called analysts. First and foremost football is a game of 90 mins not 60, 70 or even 89. Second football is about goals and not dominating possession or creating chances. Finally, with respect to Real Madrid, when will they start getting it right more often than wrong 🙄🤷‍♂️
The funny thing is that Real go into the final against Liverpool as underdogs 🤣
No one is talking about the chances Real Madrid created but couldn't hit the target. Benzema, Vini all got chances they should have buried. Ederson's save from Rodrigo which if he had scored, they wouldn't have been any extra time. But NO. You enjoy belittling Real Madrid. Can't understand why you guys are getting paid for always getting it 100% wrong. Probably just bias. I'm sure you'll still end up making LIVERPOOL the favourites even though Real Madrid's journey to the FINAL WAS AGAINST PSG, CHEALSEA AND MANCHESTER CITY. Good luck with your consistent one sided analysis.
That horror is manchester
This dude in the beginning is wack
Mendy's block 10 seconds before was more incredible than the save. One of the best goal line clearances you will ever see.
No credit to Real Madrid. They played to their strength and they are clinical. They play to their strengths with a great mentality. Missing chances is result of mind and physical conditions, and no luck. Commentary from ESPN seems very disrespectful to the Real club, fans and players.  What other teams mentally would have done after after First leg on Paris or Manchester?  Real Madrid seems to me like the GOAT of NFL Tom Brady.
This analysis is unfair to Madrid, I actually think they played really well hence the one goal scored after 90 minutes
Yeah yeah man city is great, rm is just lucky! Shut UP! Hala madrid!
Football is sometimes no logic but beauty
All my years of watching football I never thought I’d be saying Benzema for the ballon dor lol Before even Neymar….Smh
There’s no such thing as football gods. There’s only one god and he is MADRIDISTA it’s the only explanation.
The curse that Yaya Toure's agent put on him is real 😂
Real Madrid got lucky simple as that
oh SHUT UP ALEJANDRO!!! I knew and expected a come back!!! This game had the most momentum ever. We played better than any of the previous games.
Can this magic win against a more powerful Liverpool? I don’t think so, provided Liverpool play their best game.
Should’ve..could’ve..would’ve ohh shut up Stevie. City DESERVE to be slaughtered no excuses !!
Nothing logical about this win they said?  Only thing illogical is that these "pundits" bet against the greatest club in the world REAL MADRID.   They always put EPL teams on a pedestal, above all others but they fail to realize domestically is one thing, in Europe on the grandest of stages....I think today's results shows time and time again they can't produce MAGIC like REAL MADRID and other clubs.     Here is some logic: There have been three Premier League winners of the UEFA Champions League since it was formed 1992: Manchester United (twice; in 1998/99 and 2007/08), Liverpool (2004/05 and 2018/19) and Chelsea (2011/12 and 2021)  Real Madrid - 7 times!!!  And soon to be 8  HALA MADRID
Let's take a moment for Ancelotti, he's been brave and given youth a chance over the veterans.  Vinicious, Rodrygo, Camavinga, Valverde, Carlo has given them a chance at toughest times and they've delivered for him, the future is bright at Real
I believe the love for the badge and shirt play a big role as most of the Madrid squad loves the team unlike other clubs that play for the check
Stevie Nicol is gobsmacked! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Silly old man. Liverpool players are shitting their pants when they see the legendary white shirt on the opposite side. Liverpool is a high school team compared to Madrid.
What is fascinating to me is that Real Madrid has been able to reach the final with some of the most questionable defending, but yet they persist.
ManCity just bottled it again. As they always do.
As a liverpool fan, final against madrid is the best thing that could’ve happened. Then again, they’re in the final for a reason
It’s impossible not to love you! Hala Madrid! ✊🏿
So glad Los Blancos beat City. Didn't want to see them for a fourth time this season. Sick of seeing that sky blue. YNWA...
Rodrigoes ouuffff he is a man An come on Stevie madrid too inthe first half they also had pretty chances to score an missed
and this is why this is the best sport in the world. Dont ever write off anyone when you think you’ve done it dont ever underestimate the “underdogs” because it will come back to bite you like today
You need to understand that playing pretty with the ball is just not enough.  It's about the psychology of the team. they are being bashed down every day, "we're champions! we're champions! we're champions! we were born to be the best! we're meant to be on top! we bleed the royalty blood!" .... EVERY-SINGLE-DAY! They don't watch at the clock, cause when you know you can, you don't trust in luck or destiny, you just go forward fiercer and stronger, and at that level, the other men in the opposite team can't help it but feel feer, they get under their skin.
When all this pupt pundit start to pape is overrated
I don’t think city could have done anything to prevent those 2 goals, it was just the third goal that they could’ve prevented
No shot on target is deceiving, there were some very great chances that benzema and vini missed in both halves
Raheem Sterling said this is our time ………lol🤣😂
STOP Glorifying PRESSING football!! You seen it now it's more than pressing take to win a game. English football is all running around and kicking each others legs. They complain about PSGs failure what about City so called best team in EPL in last 5 years, Pepp should be ashamed off himself he didn't input enough mental strength and attitude in City players to win UCL Hala Madrid !! Sensational victory ✌️
ESPN FC pundits are hating that Real Madrid were able to knock out TWO English teams!!
Jurassic Madrid just find a way. 🤯🤷‍♂️ This is their greatest win ever if they do it. Hopefully  Liverpool will finally be too much, though. No Ramos this time. 😋
This is the history of Manchester City 😂
They’re ridiculous clueless not to touch the craziness confusion of Gardiola delima These guys Analysis 🧐 2010 Barcelona can bet Inter maybe 7-0 because it’s Morino’s team and Barcelona was the best ever team in Europe they lost it’s what happened today the same  Pepe spend billions of money to win but it’s still Pepe guys don’t you think what the special one can do with Man-city haha Gardiola isn’t the best manager try him with porto
Stevie being salty about Real Madrid, is something you can always count on.
U feed a bone to a Lion and it’ll bite your arm off and eat you alive.
If Madrid win it this year, they would have beaten PSG with all their money, Chelsea with all their money, City with all their money, and Liverpool!   “Oil producers hate them, click here to see why!”
Hello alls PEP not over thinking but just simply  not thinking aka brain fog
I told ya all so
Ancelotti won the 10th same way. Zidane, who basically just continued his work, also had several wins like that.
Can always count on Stevie to be so incredibly pro-premier league clubs when speaking about UCL. Perhaps the "never give up / till the dying minutes" mentality that Real Madrid have had for almost a decade is what actually makes them a better team than the likes of City and not just go on the biased-based notion of how they look on paper in a head to head comparison by player v player. Sheesh.
This panel is a bunch of hypocrites 😂 just in the last edition they were saying confidence won’t do it for Real Madrid and now confidence is all that matters. 🤣
😂😂 suck it Moreno. Hala Madrid!!!
But did Real Madrid play that bad? Pep himself said that they put a lot of pressure on them.  Vini missed a tap in among other chances. Benzema butchered a few chances. Thierry Henry said it right at the end, if Vini had scored that tap in, the game would’ve been over. I could be misinterpreting his analysis, but I am of the same opinion.   City cracked under the pressure, as did PSG, as did Chelsea.   So who really is the better team? The team that cracks when the going gets tough? Or the one  that has trusted one another and kept playing their game?   Real Madrid v Liverpool, will be a great final who ever wins.   Hasta el Final vamos Real! Hala Madrid!
if Vini and Benz were in form this match Madrid would score since first half , what they are talking about ?!!
Espn now 🤡🤡🤡
Unbelievable disrespect .. setting and listening to this analysis you'd think that madrid shot just 3 shots on goal .. they played a compact complete game .. nobody and I mean nobody can control the ball more than Pep's teams .. look at the first 20-30 mins of the second half as proof .. this team keeps proofing to everybody that they are champions with champion's mentality and they deserve definitely more respect than this discussion
I was dying to get home to see this. Every single panelist and hosts said that Real Madrid were out and gave City the win. Hmmm, I wonder what they’re saying now. Never count Real out until the whistle has been blown and the game is over. That is it!!!
Disgusting
This proof that oil money can’t buy you the champions league
am i the only one that didnt see city outplaying real as these cnn reporters are saying they seem equal to me a stats says so the manage to score first but they were both playing good ball tbh
4:10 but that's just got true. Nobody counted them out. Certainly not anybody serious. Saying City are more likely to win isn't counting out Madrid.
Mo Salah wish is granted😃
And Let Me Repeat It 🗣️Never Ever Ever Ever Rule Out Real Madrid!!! 🥺🥺🔥🔥🔥The Greatest Team in History 🥺🙌🏼🆑🏆
City chokers 🤣🤣🤣
Yh even Laporte not getting red card 😤
This is why Real madrid is king of europe...they never give up until its over👑🤍
You don't score 6 goals over 2 legs against City by luck. Madrid are clinical and lethal when it matters the most. Football is not about dominanting games and playing pretty; its about taking your chances and winning.
Make excuses for city but slaughtered psg 😂😂
Journalists still can’t believe what they see
As a person in life you need some Rodrigosful grace.
How can you be better than a team that beats you 6-5 on aggregate? This is the UCL not EPL. It’s about winning.
This Real team is a blast to watch, especially for a neutral soccer fan!
The Sheik will show Pep the door by June 1.
Man City didn't do this, Man City shouda done this, Real Madrid was outplayed, and on and on and on. Shouldn't Madrid's wins say something even when they are terrible? Well, Madrid find a way to win, and that is what great teams do! On to the final, and Madrid will win once more when they shouldn't have. Hala Madrid!
At 87th mins I told my friend there will be a goal before 90th and if they give 6 mins plus. There will be another 1. It happened
Hala Madrid!!
This was like watching Juventus and Man utd in the 99 semi final
Unyielding tenacity and belief. Just learn the lessons of Real Madrid, especially the ESPN crew lol
The biggest side ever.... They going to win the UCL because they just know how to win the big games!!!
How many times must a say this....Only 2 stats in football....Shots on target and goals. Real Madrid only need 5 shots on target to score 2 or more goals all season so if you give them time to take shots on target they will score.
Steve 💀
How did they do it.. really with help from the ref.. 👎👎👎
What Nichol is forgetting is that, Madrid has been through the fire... whatever Liverpool has achieved over the season won't matter in the final. Beating the best on route to the final makes a team stronger...Liverpool nearly lost it against Villarreal, they have weaknesses. Madrid is going to exploit those weaknesses fully. Madrid were heavily pressurized against Chelsea, Chelsea threw the sink at them, yet they managed to overcome. No team is going to hammer Madrid the way Chelsea did in the second leg. They have seen it all. The final is a different ball game, my money is on Madrid.
Sad! After 90 minutes, I said it's over! Real Madrid eliminated! I was happy...i even turned the TV off and went to work. Later when I got off work, I saw another history :(
This may be one of the best ucl performance from real madrid i have ever seen. This madrid team is something special , this is comming from a barcelona fan.
Ancholotte *from the heady heights of Evertons Iwobi an Co t this* 2 best teams in Europe at mo'.(If Final is anything like THAT semi (Lovren winner)a few yrs ago; we're in f a treat. Probably b 1-0.
Steve is afraid of Real Madrid i can see it in his eyes.
All of these guys yesterday had us losing!! Suck it !!
logic will suggest that if madrid manage to get the best possible result at man city they will at home also morons u guys have a premier league bias that is absolutely shameless
Espn have to redo the best young players 21yr s and younger.rodrygo goes name have to be included
SCREW THAT. THEY WANT REAL TO WIN. THEY DO NOT WANT NO PREMIERE LEAGUE TO WIN>
This the perfect result for Liverpool. The weaker team advanced. Man City will be mentally and physically drained for the league so could drop points letting Liverpool in. If we beat Spurs this weekend Liverpool will win the rest of their games. This Real Madrid team is made for Liverpool. I'm more scared of the referees because it is clear UEFA are favouring Real with the ref appointments where they appoint referees who are rewarding their diving and not punish their professional fouls. It was extremely suspicious when Real wasted 6 minutes in extra time and the ref only had 3 minutes of added time. The refs are always desperate to give Real 50-50 decision so Liverpool have to take the game out of the refs hands.  Real Madrid prove the adage so true that it is better to be lucky than good because if they somehow win it, I think they would be the worst team to win it in the last 10 years. A Man City vs Liverpool would have been the best final in CL history because you would have had two honest teams just trying to attack.  I think with Real you will get a more cynical final. Liverpool could really do the quadruple and go down in football history.
In honesty, all these pundits should quit talking about football.
Guardiola the greatest fraud in football history
I think Ali Moreno just likes saying Real Madrid.
To be honest i've heard before real madrid has special relationship with champions league and we saw that tonight against man city.  Real madrid used their historical power against man city and we can accept that even man city has world best coach in the world no matter how dominant they are in their league and europe consistency for several years now they have nothing to do in the champions league from historical point of view  and will never achieve a champions league glory
Ale is my favourite pundit.
No need to be so salty Madrid deserved to win if it was the other way around then they wouldn't have made excuses and that's facts city never won a champions league so you can't put them in the same book less the same book shelf because city doesn't feature
Steven with his English acent does not know now what to say in the previous video he say Man City this man city that
City spends more than  everyone else, has the so called best manager that can compete for the championship yet still they always bottle it. They are a disgrace!!!!!!!!!!! Someone on the panel that has morals should say it🙄
Real Madrid showed it now so many times it’s not gods or luck or anything else, that’s mentality from finest, and quality, and still people don’t recognize it and blame Other teams that they don’t played well, if a team plays like Madrid today in thjs end minutes there is not much you can make, best player in the world right now benzema, best keeper in world courtois, then Vinicius probably best winger right now, and much talent the others, if Kroos and militao get out of this team will be even stronger,  now they are easy favorite for the final, Liverpool should had lost against Villarreal would only had needed a good keeper in Villarreal and not karius 2 which gave 5 goals away.
The 90’s Chicago Bull and the Real Madrid can give you a heart attack.
I so love when these ppl brag about their English players and team. Over rated fools
Let me guess. Liverpool a huge favourites for the finals?
It's gonna be an easy match for Liverpool
Again again it’s same story, it’s not coincidence, I would rank this higher than other comebacks but Real Madrid did really play well throughout the 90th min, vini n Benz should have at least score one goal before that but that It wudnt do justice to their whole season cuz we as a fan almost love this,pure football, heart & compassion concurring over forced money football, I really love this narrative, we may or may not win the final but Madrid definitely won the footballing heart all around the globe. Hala Madrid y nada mas , I don’t wanna say much more , I’m sure everyone witnessed our legacy. We will and can get it done with or without being fav. These ESPN pundits or anyone else in the world as a hater needs to retire. Never count out my club .
Ali: Reeeeeealllllllll madddreeee
Liverpool 1 vs Real Madrid 0
Real Madrid is amazing. I don't think there's other team that even though the odds are against them they keep moving forward and don't crumble.
I hate the way this dude says real madrid
1.  No doubt in my mind.  Not an RM fan, but there was no doubt as to the final result. 2.  Mendy's goal line stop was historic!! 3.  That pass, in the overtime, from Courtois to Cavaminga (that lead to the penalty), was sublime.  Pure beauty.
When it comes to UCL , never ever count Real Madrid out ......
People said City will humble Real but, nope😆
As a Real Madrid fan, please pick Liverpool to win.
Just give the WHOLE team the  Ballon D'or right now.... Proving why their the recordbreaking 12x CL Cup Kings Benzema;the man's not human.
A Team that build in the immaculate heart of Mary the mother of Jesus, that wat leads them
The only talks that these guys should do is talk about pep UCL performance after billions spending
Where's Frank?! LOL.
bernabeu curse strikes again🤣🤣🤣😁..congrats to real madrid alot of teams should learn from them
Clueless bruh n nonsense 😤
I came to the point where I believe that even Liverpool scores first 6 goals, Madrid can come back and score 7. 🤦🤦
Can I be the guy who points out that there is a lot of us who said City need a striker to win UCL.
Real Madrid. The zombies of football.
Naymar was out for months injured and played his was not at 100 percent, it was the 80th min of the game and he made a mistake and couldn't ran back and he got slathered by the entire panel they even started to questioning his a ability lol its just funny .but Man City players and Pep  get a free pass it just crazy
I like Ale I really do but my boy talks like he knows what's to play a Champions League Semifinal at the Santiago Bernabeu... in Spanish we even have an expression for that vende humo.
does anyone know the proper way to say Real Madrid
Liverpool next, will one of the best champions league finals ever. Madrid will raise the cup in Saint Denis Not Paris
These pundits are so stupid man... Vinicius was missing sitters for fun in this game, and there wasn't a minute in this second leg where Real Madrid got OuTPlAyEd. Just look at the xG stats ffs... bUt LuCk...!
Till today I’m still confused on how pep got rid of sane for grealish but I still rate grealish don’t get twisted and Sterling should of started
HEAVY METAL GEGENPRESSERS are waiting for you period, "IN KLOPP WE TRUST" 🔥🔥🔥
Madrid is just phenomenal and pep is a bottler lmao
If a team can't keep their nerves for the last 6 mins then they don't deserve  to go in CL final. This is a abject failure for MC.  Pep was over confident of winning the tie that he took Rodri ,KDB n Mehrez off in 85 mins. As a MC fan no amount of money would buy the hunger and desire to win big trophies.  This game proved that MC didn't learn from their past CL for the last 10 years.
Madrid got more bounce back than a trampoline 😂. What a Game! GG ManCity!
That pool guy taking about logic. Irony
Now let's see Who is the bigger mentality monsters.
Where is Frank Lebouef, I NEED to see his reaction 😂😂😂
All of you on that panel should be ashamed 😂😂😂 Absolute mugs
Can we just come out and say it? The L word that people in football would rather die than admit?  I'm not city's biggest fan but Madrid got lucky and thats okay.  Stop the its in their "history" "DNA " none of these things matters in the end coz if the above is true then where was MADRID'S HISTORY AND DNA last season when chelsea knocked them out? Madrid didn't deserve to go past psg but they did which makes them deserving of being in the final. We just gotta enjoy the final I guess.
tbh the away goal rule saved man city tonight there wouldnt have been extra time but didnt matter when you play in the bernubao
I predicted Real Madrid would have beaten City 3 - 1 and Advance to the final.
This ESPN team is so pathetic 🤣🤣 even a twitter guy with 300 followers can dunk on them
The fact that Real Madrid can win this title and be the worst team in like 5 of their 6 legs just shocks me because of how it shows that a team who doesn’t even deserve to be in the finals has the chance of winning it. Semifinals they only dominate 5-10 out of 180 minutes and still advance. They have basically won the lottery in how it shows how even if the odds are low they still win somehow.
For me camvinga has to start over kross in the final
And Once again History and Passion beats Oil money.
Did it in 2014 UCL final..it’s always there.
Rodrygo doesn't score hattricks apparently
U  slathered PSG for the same reasons 🤔 but city get a pass u slathered Potchotino but Guardiola gets a pass ESPN panel is bias!!!!!!! Pep is not a great manager he is just a great coach Every team that knows out City, city is better then dem by far. But City and Pep always gets a free pass its just crazy how bias the world is.
Stupid commentators! So Madrid keeper shouldn't be there, or Mendy shouldn't be there.  Then we scored and it's all luck...smh
35 league titles, 13 Champions league titles and everyone is surprised RM are in the Final? Did everyone forget who RM are. Manchester City have only been relevant 10 years. Who were Manchester City before 2012 a mid level team at best
How many penalties has Madrid gotten in the last few ties? And how many for the oppositions? Not only history favours Madrid but the referee's too
🤣🤣🤣🤣 you can clearly see that they are pep fan. you can see the disappointment in their faces
English fans call history and pedigree heart passion and I’d rather die then lose attitude luck because it can’t be bought with money
Camivinga is like Kante what a player and benzema without question win or lose had to win ballon dor
Real Madrid will get destroyed in the Final.  WHY??   It is one game and it is not at the Bernabeu.  Game over for Real Madrid.
ESPN thinks football is played over the course of 89mins. No it's until the final whistle is blown and until that happens, Madrid can't be written off.
This is the weight of crest.  Everyone is saying City loss because of luck, football god or whatever.  If opposite happen, if RM loss in this way, there will be no tomorrow for players and manager.  Its the expectation every RM players know they have to live with.  Its la liga and CL trophy or bust for them.  There is no middle ground.
Imagine this Madrid team with Bale and Hazard playing well
City outplayed them in both leg, just 5 minute of bad football don't define ur team
Last time Real Madrid lost a European Cup /Champions League final was in Paris, to a certain team that plays in red. Hmmmm.
Ale on point tonight. "You have to get ugly to get through."
They did nothing bruh look at this old man 🗑 just trash it’s always funny win from us
Man city choke again stop saying their the favorites every year same thing city are not on the level of other big teams
Bravo realmadrid. Vamos team
I was thinking about how all these pundits counted out Real Madrid before the game. They will never learn. It’s almost like nothing good they do can be credited to them, only to other sides mistakes. The bias is sickening. Real Madrid are fair finalists and deservedly so. And if you don’t think they are, they you have no idea about football, let alone labeling yourself as a “pundit” of the sport.
Why lie n say Man city were comfortable but the only the had before the goal was the shots on target we created the best chances 🤦🏾‍♂️ they didn’t dominate the whole game imma give em 50 control of the game but they didn’t do a lot like the first leg
Love how games like this make it so plainly obvious how little pundits know.  They can repeat their prefab statements "Manchester City is a better team", "Real Madrid did nothing to suggest", etc., ignore how much time City wasted at the start of the game and refuse to accept the final score, and we'll just laugh at them.  They can then pivot to their "Diaz should have done ..." or "if Grealish's shot had gone in" and we'll just laugh some more. Go on, guys, deny reality all you want, there are only two teams in the Final and they're not the ones the pundits were sure would be there.
Real are beating Liverpool… it seems like destiny.
Man city do not have an edge and flare to win the champions league right now, it's not by playing in the PL and winning games that will make you European champions, they need to have determination
Madrid has an X factor that no amount of stats or numbers can equate....this X factor is like a force of nature once it starts to manifest it does care about who or what is in front it and this makes them the most dangerous side in UCL history.
If Real are so bad, how come they are in the final? This victory is so sweet, because everyone on this show picked Man City! I take great joy in the suffering of PSG, Chelsea, and Man City fans! The arrogance of EPL sides is sickening! Now everyone is pulling for and predicting a Liverpool victory. You Britishers will never learn. The Royal club will never be defeated by a a bunch of hooligans from Liverpool! Mo Salah! He couldn’t even sit on Madrids bench. Hala Madrid! Death to Liverpool!
Liverpool is the only team that can match Real Madrid’s mentality
Some analysts talk like they never played football. It doesn’t matter how much Man city over played Real Madrid it’s all about how a team controls the situation and go by their tactics. Guys be honest City lost because of their own negligence. Taking out Kevin De Bruyne yet they have no team without De Bruyne on the field. Madrid on the other hand can take out Modric or Kroos and the young lads can change the game.
Oh how I love these English commentators. Cry!!! Go and look at Rodrygo in Brazil....
And Sevie didn't moan about real madrid mistakes in the first leg but is moaning about city's mistakes.
I don’t want to hear this pundits keep saying city is the best team in Europe no more. They could only perform in the EPL with easy teams.
where are all those english pundits that were acting so arrogantly ''mAnCiTy Is gOiNg tO FiNal'' each time every eayr same thing man city is an arab oil club that will never win a single ucl they jsut do'nt learn do they football always humble you
Real Madrid the only team that has analysts speaking spiritual 😅
How does ancelotti remain so calm during every match😂
Guardiola cant win without Messi
Vini is going to cook Trent in the final.
Why are  this people Criticing real Madrid  I mean they won
It’s baffling that they are still underestimating this Madrid team… it’s like they get off on making fools of themselves
Real had been not as good defensively this season. Otherwise limiting this City to one or 2 chances as Atletico showed is not that difficult to the top teams outside of England. I am trying to recall which top team City played this season on the way to semi-final besides Atletico!
What won the game was individual talent. They didn’t play like a team but their individually talented. Incredibly talented. They also didn’t give up.
casimiro got away with many mistakes.. lol
This is the xG over the two legs: Man City (4.38) 5-6 (4.28) Real Madrid Yet these mfs act like Man City were far superior to Real Madrid! The English bias is insane...
There was a deflection in City second goal in first leg, and Courtois conceded two narrow angle goals he wouldn’t concede usually, and one of them when the Madrid players stopped playing thinking there was a whistle, amongst so many other things. Just stop, this is just embarrassing .
All these pundits, they all predicted Man City will beat Real Madrid. What now? Worst than me, I predicted Real will go through lol
Ale Moreno 👍🏾👍🏾
Vini will pepper trent and camavinga will out run fabinho
That just shows that you just can't buy greatness... and I don't even like Real Madrid, but they have earned their place in the final
This not pep fault this the players score you change in first leg and second the controls bother leg how can you blame pep
Mbappé is truly stupid if he decides to stay in Paris, especially after this season...
Liverpool will winner ucl tropy
That’s what happens when you pay 100 million for Grealish instead of a proper stricker like Mbappe or Haaland.
These idiot analysts are now making excuses for their beloved Man City.
Wow FINALLY someone keeping all of these biased EPL is always the best and can never do any wrong analysts accountable at 13:20. "PSG was slaughtered by the panel after what we saw from them, should Man City be? I dont think so." Steve Nichols along with many others especially the Paramount Broadcast crew and many EPL diehards just talking in circles and not able to simply credit any other team like they do their beloved English sides. The favoritism and biased in many broadcast crews in world football is truly hilarious.
City should recruit heavily as last the summer transfer window and current squad depth is questionable and rather depleted. If one looks at Liverpool, they already have continuity plan for out of contract and aging players.🧐
Gab marcotti thinking why I am on here  Not giving me a chance to speak 😕🤣😂😂😂😂
Gab who and what are you signalling to with the hand gestures on your face are you part of some secret Soceity that the football gs endorse
Theses people still say Liverpool is in favour you gonna see Paris is not Istanbul and real is not Milan my prediction real 3 Liverpool 1 and you gonna see it
Football is the only game where the better team loses
Pep Guardiola lost the game. Period. He lost it in the first game by playing fast break basketball and he lost it in this game by taking out his nucleus with 15 minutes left.
HALA MADRID!!!!  REAL MADRID ARE THE CARDIAC KIDS. THEY HAVE A NEVER-SAY-DIE ATTITUDE. They never lie down and lose. They have heart and fire.
The discussion is all about Manchester City. Yes, they were good, but why they could not score in the extra time when the score was level? Should give credit where it dues.
Stevie is so delusional. I know Liverpool are favourites but I reckon Real will beat them in the final. In a one off game anything can happen
Real Madrid is by far the deepest team in soccer six subs all six made an impact in some way
MEDIA LOL I have to give it you for such organize campaign to talk Madrid down. They are better. There is no luck. One time is luck. I been teaching martial art for a long time and I there is something called humility. Never talk down people. Learn from them and you will go further. Ask your writer to change this behavior. Its low! Respect to Man city for trying so hard and to be so close. Madrid is Magic. (To help further with understanding count goals. the team that scored more is better) Logic
So that it wont be forgotten since Casemiro booking seemed significant to the Man city pundit,  I wonder how Laporte stayed on the field after that face slap!
None of you fellows gave any chance to madrid eh...shows how clueless these pundits are
Ironically, Madrid's apparent lack of urgency worked to their benefit, as it meant that city couldn't pounce on the counter and attack as much as most people (including City) expected.
Why are the pundits talking as if MADRID is nothing but just luck
7:30 he just ignores her question lmao
If away goals still rule, Real Madrid goes to the final without extra time
Still can’t believe it  It’s hard to believe what happened
Casemiro nullified KD
Liverpool has has had the easiest to the final, I can't believe people still favorite them to win all, has no one learned anything from the last 3 ties you can't count out madrid. It will be ever bitter sweet when Liverpool lose and the expression  on Klopp's face and to hear his excuses,  will be glorious. The football God's  will favorite Madrid again. Hopefully Mbappe and Rudiger are  watching cause with them there won't be a need for comebacks next season.
Every team Real Madrid faced in this UCL run was a better squad than them  … What a run ! 🙌🏾💯 definition of “never say die”
As a fan of football, I am just happy that human abusing money lost today. And I hope they never win. Not in football, or in anything.
Real Madrid win over two legs against psg, Chelsea and city and its voodoo , put some respect on the name. The corner flag has 13 titles printed on it.
Choke City
Camavinga changed the game along with Rodrygo, Real Madrid's team spirit is elite
So there is a God, and of course He wears white.
All that money spent and still same number of finals as Arsenal & Spurs and they done it with less money and weaker squads...
all of them picked city over real madrid now they all can export salt to other countries :) ! but ale is the most precise among them
Hala Madrid !!! Bwahaha !!! Except for the lovely Kay Murray, these ESPN commentators are delusional and need psychiatric help. Sure in the 1st game, Real Madrid’s defense was sad & pathetic, but Man City’s defense was only marginally better. Now these braindead pundits are whining about Man City’s missed opportunities. “Could of, would of, should of”, is the refrain of failure. I don’t know what Pep was smoking, but taking out DeBruyne & Jesus was questionable, at best. Both Man City and Liverpool had relatively soft draws in this UCL, but Real Madrid had to defeat PSG, defending Champs - Chelsea, and now vaunted Man City. Rodrygo has been amazing, Camavinga played a role in several key goals. In extra time, I had no doubt that Real Madrid would win. Pep is the most overrated manager in Europe. He can only win UCL titles with players named Messi, Xavi, Iniesta, Pique, Busquets, Puyol & others in their prime. Hala Madrid - Los Reyes de Europa !!!
I think the real problem is that Pep does not have his heart and conviction into winning the European Championship League. His main heart and confidence seem to mainly be into the English Premier League only. And this result was expected based on the result from the first leg match and based on previous Man City results in the last European competitions. This is not to take away anything from Real Madrid because they took their opportunities very well. But one needs to frankly analyze why Man City keeps repeating their failures in European competitions.
Madrid has the best squad on paper just second to PSG. They have the best 4 young players in the world: Vinicius, Valverde, Camavinga, Rodrygo. They even have the best goalie in Courtois. We are underestimating this team because Ancelotti has never been able to make it work and key players are getting older. They look awful and too defensive in the length of 90 mins. At any time their great players can create something out of nothing. They also play with spirit.
Real Madrid played very good in the 2nd half. Especially in the last 10mins of the 90 and both halves of extra time. Not sure if these guys were watching the game.
Gab, the karma you should talk about is Ramos injuring Mo in 2018
how sad you look 👀
Where’s Craig burley when u need him ????
Most defenders can't defend anymore it is all about this playing out at the back bollocks. They don't know how to head a ball or tackle anymore.
I've already said that here but I'm gonna say again.. this Brazilian generation is coming strong, it's time to France and Brazil dominate the world of football again.
Camavinga just booked a spot in the finals
Pep gave it away easily the players did fantastic but pep couldn’t deal with last 5mins that’s. Bad
Gab is sensible
this people maybe would overhype city again next year hahahaha... probably milan will get their 8th cl before city gets their first cl
Stevie is salty af! 😂
These people keep underestimating Madrid, they forget that no matter who is in the way, this is Real Madrid.
These "supernatural" talks are becoming too much. Truth is we have incredibly talented squad, full of legends of the game (Benzema, Modric and Marcelo are amongst the best players ever in their respective positions) and young stars.
The powers that be have given us a season we will be talking about for the rest of our lives!!!
I am not sure if Real madrid deserved it, that penalty was not convincing enough.
You don't bottle a 2-0 lead in the 89th minute to RM of all teams, you take that ball and hold on to it at the far corner  flag for dear life and see it out.
I glad city are out I'm tired of these silly pundits talking about all English final.Pep deserves to get fired even if he has a few months left on his contract.
RM has a lot of energy. You can’t beat us
Incredible these pundits still talk about 'Madrid did nothing for 90 minutes', are you kidding? rewatch the highlight, Vini missed 2 sitters, so did Benzema. Saying there were no shots on target is very flattering to Man City. Didn't Madrid also finish the first half with more possession?
I love coming here just to laugh at this people all the time 😂😂 HALA MADRID
Es el mejor equipo de la Historia del Fútbol... El Rey de Europa..
Imagine if Villarreal hadn't bottled it in the second half. We would have had just a regular La Liga match!
Hala Madrid ...y nada más
Ale always makes sense. Man City didn’t have situational awareness or they ugly passionate heart - Pep must’ve told them how the stadium atmosphere is and they’ve experienced how Real got through at home.
It’s pretty obvious FIFA gave Madrid the win and the season but alright.
I mean if these pundits were bettors they would see Real Madrid doing this .. from man city scored I said okay this game has now started because Real Madrid will score 2
U pundits r always against madrid and mark my words madrid will win again and about the mistakes city made we can say that others teams scored because of faults made by madrid defence
Voodoo? Gab is a racist. Voodoo is a recognised religion.   Stick to Jesus you pizza botherer.   Typical from him though.
I’m not a Madrid fan but I want them to win just for the sake of Stevie. He’s a total clown
Yeah. Madrid is insane. Remember the lucky goals from the last final betwen the 2 teams? That was mental..the goalie is literaly still in rehab. He chaged his body alot 🏋🏋🏋
plzz dont count real for the final...we love to go underdog
Whoever wins the Champions League, the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of The year will come from that club, whether it's Salah, Benzema or Mane...it will be one of them.
If Madrid wins the final they’re gonna say it’s Liverpool fault, they’ll never say Madrid know what they’re doing,
Please where is Craig Burley? Never ever write off Real Madrid
Real play football for 40mins. When do they begin these 40mins? That's just up to the opponent to make sure they are cooked by then.
ESPN FC is full of Madrid-hating frauds… always want discredit Real Madrid and put fault on the opponents “playing bad” … this network is a joke
Its Man City's fault for not finishing the game properly in the first leg.
The fight, the mentality in this Madrid team is simply unbeatable. When you think they're down, they rise back up again. Vini Jr, Benzema, Courtois, Modric, Rodrygo, Militao, literally EVERY Madrid player was putting up a fight. They're incredible.
When I saw Modric chase down KDB in the first half, I knew we had a chance.
That is the magic of Football!
Shoutout to Nacho, what a performance tonight! Not one of the big names in that team, but boy does he step up when called upon!
pep to overrated
"The invincible" city team got clapped😂😂😂😂😂
3 .... 1 Stevie What were you smoking???
Gezzz kay is so fine
It amazes me how dumb the ESPN panel is. They always chat a bunch of rubbish then come back crying afterwards
I screamed so loud that my dog started barking thinking we getting robbed 🤣. As a Westham fan,I wish we get this Madrid luck tomorrow against Frankfurt.
I hear a lot of if's, could have's and should have's. Stop making excuses and thinking about hypothetical nonsense. Real Madrid won. Cry yourself to sleep, haters
Fraudiola spent millions on that defence and they are almost as Bad as Man Uniteds defence hahahaha
The front 3 wasn't at their best???? How about Madrid effieciently contained them and were better
Madrid has never won a semi final after losing the first leg this was the statistic before the match. City really messed up here all the wonderful work Pep had done at City all these years has gone to the drain without winning Champions league all his legacy is nothing. If Di Mateo can win it with Chelsea you expect to be a walk in the park for Pep.
Stevie drools when Trent sends crosses like that. The bias!
These pundits are so biased.  Real were great and Mark my word, they will beat Liverpool and become Champions 🏆
Stevie too, is just so salty because he knows his overrated squad is going to get dominated! 😂
Is City really a better team? In some positions for sure, but they also have a ton of dead weight like Sterling and Grealish. Without KDB they can't create anything.
Guys please put some respect on Real madrid they did 13 times
Salty bastards always doubting madrid. 😂😂
Haven’t seen trolling in the comments before city’s lost. Haha fun to see hala Madrid
when it's coming There's no stopping
i think the ESPN CREW IS BIAS with ENGLISH TEAMS SMH
When it comes to Madrid just watch,don't blink till the final whistle
Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, El magico!!!!
Laporte and Dias have always been suspect, Dias was horrendous in the Euro's. Highly overrated pair, that's why Pepe is still in charge of the Portugal defense because of Dias' deficiencies as a defender. He's a bit like Roque Junior, Roque looked brilliant next to Lucio to win the world cup, brilliant next to Paulo Maldini to win the Champions League, moves to another club gets exposed, becomes the original Harry Maguire.
early substitutions caused city today
Don’t forget that handball in extra time by cancelo that the didn’t call 😉
Man city going out of CL for me is down to pep those sub I don't get it d game has been calling for sterling to counterattack since ....it's all on the coach for me
You can’t buy Football Heritage
Real Madrid just never gave up until the final whistle, that's your winning mentality in Europe big games just like Liverpool are doing, something that Manchester City doesn't have. However, Man City controlled the game pretty much both legs, especially the first one should have scored more goals and kill the tie, but they didn't and now paid the price. As a Liverpool fan I'm glad Man City are out, hopefully that might affect them negatively in the league games, as for Real they are very clinical and mentaly strong, but I think Liverpool pressure and physicality will be too much for them to handle.
Pep and his boys are frauds city is the biggest bottler and pep is the Biggest Fraud in football history
Madrid never gives up.
Just cause you dominate possession and create more chance doesn’t mean you are better. Madrid take most of their chances and are stronger defensively, and mentally to me they are the better team.
Ok, I will ask, how was that a penalty thou?
You clowns kept counting them out.
All credit to Real Madrid, but I think its a bit unfair how they got to play an extra 30 mins at home against Chelsea and Man City so the other teams were at a huge disadvantage. Before when it went to extra time atleast the other team got extra time to score away goals but now its a clear advantage to the team that plays the second leg at home. Either bring back away goals or get rid of extra time and go straight to pens.
Stevie trying to explain something that he himself  realizes does not make sense and he end up saying "some things you can't explain" 😂😂😂
I don’t care what anybody else says. Even if liverpool wins also it doesn’t matter. Real Madrid deserve the CL title this year just for their insane champion spirit and winning mentality. They’ve shown it time and time again. Unlike having spent like Barca, Psg, Chelsea, City and liverpool in the last 2-3 seasons, without having much good B team players to keep rotating the squad, always getting shamed by the critics for their ageing midfield, slow paced games and not playing the best football but just getting the results they still shut everyone up. Remember they had to beat PSG, Chelsea and City to be in the Champions league final and have won the league already and still have the chance to make a record of biggest points gap win in laliga history.     Haters keep hating.     Hala Madrid.
Lol
Ale often suggests or alludes that this unbeatable nature is part of Real Madrid’s DNA. Well I could not disagree more, I believe it all comes from one man, Ancelotti. When he left as coach a few seasons ago, they were totally in-ept in recent seasons in the Champions League, the home fans outraged and booing as they were getting demolished by lowly Ajax and last season being academically eliminated by Chelsea. Ancelotti is the Ex factor in all of this. Take him out of this club and they would have been eliminated numerous stages ago. Maybe Ancelotti is using NLP to the max, or has occult knowledge, but it’s all coming from him.
Why’s is nobody talking about Casemiro 2 foul that was both yellow and was never booked
Man city defenders underestimated Rodrigo they didn't believe je could make something jappend for them and that why when he came on both Diaz and laporte didn't really concentrated on him and now he has done them bad
I don’t think Liverpool prefers to play Real Madrid.  Real Madrid when pushed can play at a really high pace.  Manchester City is also a known entity.  And Pep would over analyze himself to defeat.
They are crying inside 😂😂
Thers only one God u pagan barbarians
It is great to see Man City lose v Real Madrid.
So many City players looked knackered. KDB was awful - nothing came off for him and after making a couple of runs he was physically shot. He often goes red in the face but he was there after 15 minutes and as the game went on and he got even more red - I was scared his head might explode! Silva played well, Walker was immense and Cancelo pretty well. Foden and Jesus have done too much running in too many recent games. I must also say when the ref is allowing a more physical game, the team lacks a physical presence past Rodri. Only KDB puts himself about and that's not something he should be concentrating on. Overall it was a decent performance that on this day didn't work out. I thought all of Peps subs made sense and so there's not too much to complain about as a City fan. Some of the players are getting long in the tooth and will need replacing soon. Grealish still looks a bit of a show pony and something of a mistake but again, I didn't mind him being signed and so I can't to criticise his signing - besides I always think its good to freshen up the squad each summer .... and in January quite frankly. Keep trying - we'll get there. Hopefully the players have the character to do the job of winning the league!
Stevie: "How long can that last?" LOL He's kidding, right? They just beat three of the best teams in the world and these pundits have said that after each game. That's what makes Real Madrid great. They make their chances count and rise to the occasion. Man City is a great team, but like all of Guardiola's teams, they seem almost robotic in their near perfection. They lack that special spirit and inspiration that teams like Liverpool and Man City (and even some lower down teams) possess.
Steve is a f**king liar he would rather love to play man city rather than Real Madrid
Believe is what makes this RM team great,  they are going to win the Champions League.
English pundits are very entertaining after games like these...
Man City, Chelsea, they're over-coached, the coaching staff has removed all agency from the players so when things go wrong, they can't adapt. The reason both Chelsea and City, especially Chelsea were in the final last year is because there were no fans. Fans add an extra layer of unpredictability, of emotion, which is what drives teams like Madrid and Liverpool, it's why they're so great at this competition.
Sorry but pep through that away! Taking off kevin at that time was a bad move! Even the commentators were shocked! (Watching in Spanish) crazy
Don Carlo > all
Oh my god. This pundit. Even when real are won, they said man city make mistake 🤣 we just knew how to win. Having better did not mean you can win. Real madrid knew how to win, we knew that if we got only 1 goal disadvantage in 1st leg, we got a huge chance
Big Club Real Madrid > small oil club
Real Madrid deserve a place in that final they were unbelievable still cannot believe it😲😱  fair play to Real didn't want City tbh we played them so much I became tired of them.
This what happened when someone can overshadow another player. Look at Big Benz right now shinning like a star. And when Cr7 was there,everybody over looked Big Benz and look at Benzema today🤷🏿‍♂️
Man city has a team while Madrid has individual players that are better.. it games like these, individual brilliance decide most games. That's y Spanish teams dominate europa and champions league.
Isn't our host looking lovely today.
Whenever city scored, you knew Madrid would score but when Madrid scores and goes ahead, you know city aren't gonna score cuz they would flinch. In fact city had been beaten psychologically before this game.
Thank you and welcome to the final /Liverpool fan
Please who else saw the expected goals? Madrid 2.61, City 1.20...was that a mistake?
Stevie is funny 😂
Real Madrid does not play finals - they win them!
Jealous english people. So scared that Loserpool will blow it too
Didn't know there was a "curse" on Pep till I opened Twitter and saw the tweets.
Like I said on twitter, anytime I come here and I hear the pundits completely writing Real Madrid off, I go to bed happy, knowing Real Madrid will have them eat their words. YET, after every game, they'd still chuck it own to luck and saying 'No chance' against this or that next opponent.   By now, shame should have set in when you say game after game, 'No way this team wins' and they do so over  and over till they get to the final of the hardest competition, beating the teams everyone plus these pundits called 'favorites'.   How many days ago was it that they called giving Real Madrid a 20% chance to City's 80% 'generous?
football is not fair
Its Man city V Real Madrid one clubs is a tin pot state backed championship club Vs the most historic side in champions league history city had a nosebleed they should be playing away to Barnsley in the championship all these billions and a bang average baldy Spanish manager gives them a chance to be in these positions and they will continue to fail because its Citeh.
I am a Barca fan.but respect to Madrid, the experienced guys in their team are preparing the new generation like Rodrigo, Camavinga, Valverde, vinicius all these guys, imparting all the years of experience of Kroos, Modric,Caswmiro, Benzema. These guys are turning these young players into mentality monsters as well that's the scary part. And it pisses me off that Camavinga, Valverde and vinicius if they win the CL would have won a league title and a CL before Pedri, Gavi and Fati, and maybe just like it happened in 2010s our youngsters will gain more experience and win CLs and league titles themselves and I am sure it will happen with Xavi, because Barca rightnow are not throwing money at players like pep is doing at city to think you can just buy your way and create a team like that 2011 Barcelona team which was mainly made up of talent but most importantly that team had a soul because most of the players are from the academy unlike this man City team.but man , and I don't think pep will win the CL with city. But man Madrid!! Come on man Camavinga is a player, he is a baller,and I love pedri and I think he is the heir to Iniesta like most people but Camavinga is definitely taking on the mantle from Modric and Kroos when they leave, he is a baller and Valverde is quality as well.
I'm glad Nedum isn't like your typical English PL pundit who are all about English football & can't credit other team's in other leagues they see the game not like Stevie & other's who think its the EPL & that's it such a sour puss of a man
Pep needs physically strong players to keep the ball on the attack and to handle the contact aspect of the game. There is where he loses these crucial games.
Did nedhum say mahrez was very quiet, did he not score the city’s goal 😂
How are they better when they are sitting home 😂
Football > Money 🙃
Apply some ice to the burnt area ESPN pundit and PL fans, clown of pundits on ESPN! NEVER, NEVER write us off! Whether you like it or not, we are the GOAT. Post PSG match/ Chelsea draw, everyone was saying Chelsea will easily beat Madrid, The arrogant over rated PL fans didn't learn their lesson and said the same thing that Pep and City are a different story and will crush Madrid. LOL I suggest everyone go and read Post Chelsea match comments here or on Dailymail and have fun with it! Anyways, Hala Madrid.
Ali Moreno is such a turn off...🙄
This City team giving me chronic depression.
Fun Fact: City has as many CL titles as Bolton.
This just prove it that a good coach does matter, against PSG and Chelsea  and city today we can really see that the coach won the games for them with all the changes he made and when he made them. Incredible
Sweet sweet English tears.
Real Madrid are going to make it look easy against Liverpool in the final. It's going to be a one sided game - watch my words! The final will be easiest game for Madrid!
How does real Madrid do this ? Simple.. unlike other clubs, real Madrid players are fan(Fanboys) of the club.
bro i swear that’s tata martino
NGL REAL MADRID has the best players!! YOUNG AND OLD Both Amazing ❤️‍🔥
English media trying to brainwash people since 2014 by overhyping & saying that city are favorite to win cl, city better team than real bayern etc etc & u had all these premier league cocky fans were running their mouths by saying city will thrash real madrid real won't come back against city, walker is coming back like wlaker is maldini cancelo is coming back like cancelo is cafu & talking big games  like city is prime milan or prime real madrid. in the end city did worse than chelsea & psg. from 89-94 mins city were down 2 1 & 4 mins in extra time city were out from cl. i don't know future & i don't know if these english people will now say Liverpool is favorite to win the final haha ridiculous..at this point english media is a joke. people in english media are better comedian than kevin heart.
Real Madrid is doing miracles for Manchester United. One down, please beat Liverpool in the final as well so that this Liverpool and City are best in the world rhetoric needs to die. Real Madrid remains the best in the world.
The pattern is Camavinga coming on at crucial points in each of these games and literally the midfield is completely energized that’s why it looks like luck. if Camavinga doesn’t start Liverpool will cook them
Stevie is wrong on this one. As a fan of City, I for one cannot keep accepting my team failing apart at the last moment. We almost lost to Atletico last time around. Enough is enough! $400 millions on a defence that keeps coming short on the biggest stage.
You guys were saying a couple weeks ago there was going to be Manchester City and Liverpool in the finals haha very wrong
The facts are ,City crumbled,Liverpool won’t,Liverpool will beat Madrid in Paris like last time .YNWA.
I just can’t understand 😂
The reason: Man City didn't buy a world class striker in Summer 2021
Real Madrid af a good crop of talented youngsters, they are literally still kids. Incredible
Relax Madrid fans, Klopp is not Pep, he won't bottle it.
The crew is very biased towards English teams .. Man city needs another billion to win UCL, but they keep forgetting you can never buy fans and belief...
I said it before when everyone jumping and talking PSG and City Bayern that you just cannot write off Real Madrid they Champions League kings.
Fricken Black magic 🪄😂😂😂
U are trying to dismiss Real Madrid. But we have been better
Alle: "...touched by forces beyond our understanding." This is one of the wisest things I've ever heard on this show. The Western reductionist view that counts numbers and calculates odds and judges solely by the surface appearance of things is, at best, a limited understanding of reality. It's amazing to see this manifested in this beautiful game in moments like this. The Trickster spirit of mythology manifested itself yet again, and the powerful spirit of LIFE and inspiration overcame all odds and logic and numbers to create yet another "miracle."
Bro Madrid left behind PSG, CHELSEA and MAN CITY is not just luck give credit where credit due
The only logical explanation is Pep bottled it with his substitutions
Stevie still salty over Madrid hurting Salah in the last final they played eachother 😂.
espn your whole crew failed to predict result i think there need to be some kind of responsibility for this hahahahah
I wish Real Madrid gave us some of their good luck
Why wasn't casemiro sent off? Real madrid are rats period no matter what they can't never win clean always something
Lol 😂 ESPN please put Liverpool as favorites to win I dare you to keep disrespecting Real Madrid all of you look like fools.
Stevie is so baised
This could end up being one of the worst seasons for Manchester City considering how brilliant they've been in creating chances, only to just not shoot the ball and miss clear and easy chances they've had all season. This first leg should've been 7-3 but they just continue to allow teams to come back, and now to go home after allowing 2 goals in 2 minutes and then conceding a stupid penalty 3 minutes later? Hats off to Real Madrid for their fairytale run this season, but I'm simply astounded by how City always find a way to NOT win big games. This loss might be worse than the Spurs 2017/18 quarterfinal and last year's final combined. Terrible game management by Pep, and City's players are just DOG TIRED and it shows. Here's hoping they can hold on and win the Premier League, but I think Liverpool will snatch it away based on what we saw today.
After hearing this guy saying Real Madrid like that so often, suddenly, Spanish doesn’t sound so sexy.
The Key is that all of them feel the Shirt, they are all Madridistas ❤️❤️ who feel for the club .
Hala Madrid y nada mas
STFU with football gods
So now ESPN pundits believe in FOOTBALL GOD, my god, Madrid is preaching new religion... Because we are the GODS
I just want to thank Camavinga for coming on and having an impact in every single game during this incredible champions league run. HALA MADRID
ESPN shame on you guys always against Madrid, and today we put Shame on you guys again😝😝😝😝
City play good but not win
On paper it's always easier to play against RM, but on the pitch I think Liverpool has a higher probability to win had it been MC than RM, cause RM don't need to play well to win ucl, we've seen it times and times again. So that's something can't be overlooked.
Um, who counted Real Madrid out?  Punters all over the world were taking Real Madrid to win at the ridiculously generous odds being offered - just check any punting forum.  It's always the way, the media and their apparent experts all convince the watching public that Real Madrid (underdog) has no chance and sucker the poor mugs into ploughing into Man City and then the sharp punters hoover up the other side.  The exact same thing is happening in the stock market right now.  Talking heads are convincing retail investors to keep buying the dip while the institutions are falling over themselves to buy puts and sell their big clients out of this market as rates begin to tighten.
Stevie forgot vini destroyed liverpool last season
All of you in that panel should either apologize or resign my prayers was strong !
Honesty by nadum. Facts. City need slaughtering, because they could have kill the game in both legs. Dont be wasteful against RM. Learn that💯
These so called pundits just want to find excuses to undermine Real Madrid, especially the glass-wearing British guy. How can he criticize City when they dominated Real at their own terf, played a perfect game, and had 2 goals lead with just 5 minutes left to play.  What else they could do better!  He's still pointing at City's defender's fault, not giving credit to Real. Are you kidding me!  Real forced this situation on city being Real Madrid. See their other analysis of how they praised Liv for the comeback. These guys are still underestimating real Madrid even after knocking out their favourites PSG, Chelsea, and now City. This must've hurt them badly hahaha
rrRrRRrrrRrrrRrRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreal madRRrRrrrRRRrrrid
it show who's Manchester best chance of winning a champions league cup. cause it's not pep
Madrid This is not football it wasn’t penalty 💰this is fake champions league  I knew it the the reff will do that
Now I hate this channel.
Madrid beat psg chelsea man city but liverpool r favs 😭
Cashed out on my bets on the 80th min  I thought real was out I had accepted the defeat still can’t believe it ..
CAMAVINGA is just too solid man he’s gonna run Kross out of town and Rodrigo my goodness hala Madrid
This is a really bad cast And show in comparison to paramount … have tried a few times to watch this and yikes
Good for real Madrid but Liverpool beat real Madrid 5_0 final at Paris
20 minutes to explain it in 2 words.  Football Heritage
The game of football is played until the final whistle, and the team that wins the game is the one that take their chance and also has strong mentality. The game does not care about what you think or expect as a panelist, and for me that is pure logic, everything else the is emotions.
Wow didn't realize Gab hated Real.  Hala Madrid 🙌
Watching British Media gives me laugh. How horrible a country’s media can be, they always demonstrate that. They are so funny. It’s a shame!
It's hilarious that they are still trying to explain why did Madrid win the game or why Man City lost it. They keep blaming the city players and saying that they had they game under control. From what I saw, Madrid had many chances which they didn't take advantage of in the first half. If they would had score those they wouldn't be talking like that. (Benzema two shots, vinicious one, and Modric one all off target in the first half). Either way, I know Madrid didn't have the possession of the ball, which they idolize Guardiola for doing. But honestly it really doesn't matter against Madrid. Because they'll score on you no matter who you are. I'm still in shock that ESPN always trashes Madrid and that they should be slaughtered by any other team.
Ale chances don't win a football match. Goals win it. Simple !!
people forget easily that vini jr had a sitter and he missed it. and that doesnt count as shoot on target but should have been a goal.
On the real Madrid first goal, the rodrygo position is like Ronaldo position, at first they offside but it a... because he is the one who has the advantage after a good movement like this
Just finished watching the hilites.... (1) The Walker Injury was huge and pretty much the chaos caused by switching Cancelo to the Right and bringing on Zinchenko messed up Citys backline balance...(2) Grealish is rubbish - the most useless 100M player ever...(3) Reuben Diaz like most of the City was switched off and has a role in all 3 goals... Let me explain....   For The Real equaliser (1-1) Grealish is defending too deep...he should be more upfront preventing Camavinga (or at least making him think about making a run at the City goal...as it turns out he's so far away from Camavinga -that Camavinga has time to Trap the ball with his Right foot and then switch and cross the ball with his left foot to Benzema --all because Grealish is a glorified show pony....also Cancelo is watching the offside line and lets Benzema get away from him [this is acceptable as he was watching the offside line] -whats wrong is that after the cross goes - he does not attack that side to see if it has safely gone into touch or that a Real Player cant get to it....Benzema gets it and kicks it back in...Now for Diaz,, he is also completely switched off..he is ball watching and Rodrygo gets the run on him to tap it in.....For the 2nd Goal(2-1 RMA) Zinchenko and GRealish are making a right mess of defending the left-hand side(Zinchenko is too deep and too close to the penalty area and Grealish is too deep aswell - they basically getting in each others way) as it is ball goes out wide... Grealish does his useless pressing impression and it gets crossed back in ...Diaz ball watching again gets out jumped by Asensio...the ball comes of Asensio for Rodrygo to head it back in....For the 3-1 lead...Diaz again was switched off...no need to explain... I actually mentioned to a mate of mine before the Start of Extra time at 5-5 AGG - that even if City Score first they gona lose this game....Its all mental....FYI Dunno what PEP was thinking taking Mahrez off...Overall I think City were too scared to go and lose this game..rather than go dominate and win it...
Pep has failed again
In Football not only Tactics matters. that 's the issue coaches like Pep and Tuchel have. Football was originally a game of courage, emotions and believe. As a Madrid fan, am speechless and i don't care what happens after this. I have been entertained, got all the lows and highs with this team in the last 6 years.
We conquered 3 oil-rich stated-owned clubs back to back.  Hala Madrid!
Wow Nicol can't admit he got it wrong again! Never count Real out.
Vini jr, will completly destroy trent in the CL final.
I just saw a old jealous Man here But why I am loving it
Steve  is in denial it's a nockout ,ask bayern about villarreal,
Do these pundits (Stevie) watch the match or even the highlights?. Real Madrid had 3-4 good chances in the 90 mins to score. Zero shots on target does not really suggest poor play. It was down to poor finishing from Vinicius and an early chance for Benzema.
I m jealous of real fans. How can a team have this much luck 3 goLs in 5 mins of a UCL semi ? How is Real Madrid making these many late comebacks. Irs been happening since 2015...Most of their games are like this
🔥🔥🔥 It is now official. Real Madrid is the OIL CLUB TERMINATOR! 🔥🔥🔥 Manchester City bottled it again 🤣🤣🤣 It is in the club's DNA guys. One club is the serial winner of the UCL and the other is Manchester City 🤣🤣🤣 One more club to go and what a glorious season this would be for one the weakest Real Madrid teams in the past 10 years. If they beat Liverpool, this means they would've taken out the French champs and the Premier League big three in one season, what an accomplishment would that be 🔥🔥🔥
People discuss City adding Haaland next season, but just imagine Madrid adding Mbappe and whoever else to their midfield and defense next season.
its incredible that they thought vity dominatex I felt Madrid been threatening a goal for half of the first half and half the the second half, game was even for the most part, once again in my opinion city really did score against the run of play "at that time city were struggling to create second half before their goal.
Gab should eat his word back
Ale Moreno talks too much, interrupts too much, and says too little.
Mentality monsters. Hala Madrid y nada mas
City disgraced themselves pep is not the best manager in the world, he hasn’t even won one champions league cup yet
There’s nothing to understand it’s REAL MADRID we have a crown on our shield for a reason
Always underestimating Real Madrid. Show some respect. The entire crew didn’t think Real Madrid was worthy.
Bunch of hypocrites. Give Madrid their credit
Hahahah Fraudiola bottled it again. Everytime he gets stressed, he does something stupid/random. 🤣🤣🤣
what made this result even more incredible, is that Benzema was off his game.. he missed clear chances all game, badly too..he was the one bailing us out time and time again.. that’s why I almost turned the game off.. I couldn’t watch when he was taking the penalty.. but I guess the Kareem rises to the top! Hala Madrid!
JUST REMEMBER THE YEAR CHELSHEA WON THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
These lot write madrid off every time, when  they wib three in a row just 3 years ago they wrote them off as well
For football fans, we thought Real Madrid had a 50-50 chance. City wasn’t the clear favourite. People forget their struggles against Atletico Madrid.
The more they speak the more they sound idiotic.. When will they learn?? Never count madrid out.. I cant wait to hear Frank leb itch take, im sure its goin to include luck and miracle.
They all underrated realmadrid
Is it me or does ESPN has an EPL bias?  They talk about Real Madrid needing the Futbol God's help but they talk about Liverpool's legacy as a given.
That game is why I love this beautiful sport my 2 teams are now in the final I'm genuinely happy
Real Madrid DNA
سوف اقول دائما ان بنزيما ليس باللاعب الذى يستحق ان يرتدى قميص ريال مدريد. كالمعتاد فى كل مبارة لازم يضيع كذا هدف مؤكد . و كالمعتاد من الاسوء اللاعبين فى المبارة للاسف نيلة و خيبة . الحقيقة انة  ليس مهاريا  اطلاقا . اوقات كثير حسن الحظ و التوفيق تساعدة ماعدا  ذلك لنا الله . يجب على  الريال تتصرف فى هذا اللاعب الكارثة .يجب استبداله فى اسرع وقت ممكن مهما كان يسجل اهداف . وليس للارقام اى معنى فى ذلك . ببساطة لولا الفريق لما كان بنزيما اى قيمة . و هذة الحقيقة  . انة ياخذ فرص من ذهب لا تعوض و اذا وضعت مكانة اى لاعب سوف يسجل مهما كان . يجب استبدال هذا اللاعب المعاق . Go out benzema
Fortunately we as fans know better than these biased pundits
HALA MADRID!!!!! 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Steve Nikol brings nothing to the table. All he knows is  Liverpool. I thought was a top level show. Bring another Proffesional that is objective.
Lets spare a moment for the Real Madrid fans that left before stoppage time
The  term you are using as "City were in control" is wrong. Yeah, they didn't allow Madrid to score, but City didn't take the game away either. Madrid were just waiting for the sucker punch at the right moment. They were hanging on/waitng and deep down they knew, they only need couple of moments to score and be in the final. It doesn't mean Madrid were abysmal. There  are many ways to win a game. Sounds like you guys just watch Liverpool and City, and only thing high pressing, always attack are the only ways to win. Italy have 5 WCs for example.
stevie just doesnt wanna give credit, whatta hater!!!
Our fighting spirit is what makes us different and what makes us winners. ⚽️❤️🏆 Hala Madrid Y Nada Mas 🤍🩸❤️ VAMOSSS
When I hear Ale and Stevie talk I feel like my grandma could do a better job at Punditry.
All we liverpool fans need a draw for City in PL.
ESPN never seems to give Madrid their credit no matter how many times they show them.
Most successful club in Europe managed by the most successful manager in Europe and you people are surprised? 😅  Please back Liverpool so we can laugh at you in the end 😅
They are better individually ( chelaea psg and city) not collectively💯🤷
😂🤣 I love watching these deluded English pundits after a Spanish team defeats a beloved English team of theirs. ✌️
Don't try to find the fault in Manchester City. It's Real Madrid who did the good job.
They always say it’s a bad defending whenever Real Madrid Score and win matches..
Poor Gab is still holding on to that thought
Steve is an absolute POS just admit it dude you were completely wrong.
Pep is not destined to win the UCL with ManCity.
RODRYGO
Your opinions don’t matter !go Cry
Man city was so great but get knock out 6.5 on goals 🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡
Wanted to pack the bus by subbing KDB and Mahrez but that didn't go as planned
OMG I LOVE MADRID HALA MADRID!
These clowns all picked City to win 🥴
After Rodrygo entering the pitch, i said to my brother, he is our lucky charm….after minute 80, I told him that I will go to temple and pray everyday in one full week if somehow RM survive…lol
I still don't understand how the ESPN FC pundits get paid to go on TV and not believe in RM. They said they'd lose to PSG and then to Chelsea and then again to City. When will you understand that you can't bet against RM? Ok people get it wrong sometimes but you are the experts and getting it wrong 3 times in a row is a embarrassment. Let's see who you'll pick to win in the final and whether you'll learn from your mistakes.
No one mentioning how casimero should have been sent off 1st half. And how the ref added 6 mins to 90, when city were up. Then only 3 minutes in extra time, when real wasted more than 6 minutes and city were down. Plus sterling not getting the free kick and getting yellow carded for a clean tackle. This match seemed unfair.
Steve Nicol's words will come back to haunt him when Real Madrid beat liverpool and then us Real Madrid fans will be the only ones laughing.
Liverpool will extinguish Real Madrid's magic exactly as they did Villarreal's 😆
If any one read berserk, madrid are the real strugglers
Amazing semis! That was the true final! Now the kings of Europe are coming to beat up on Liverpool once again! 😂😂
They were dead. Dead. DEAD! Maybe not buried. 🤣🤣🤣
Nooo Real Madrid just play till the end. They spark up in the end. Just when u count them out.
Madrid didnt play as bad as everyone is making out to be. Vinicius should have done better on 2 or 3 occasions. I think the game was kinda balanced. Also Camavinga / Valvede  midfield might need to be phased in slowly, Kroos is showing his age
Even if City had scored two, who is not to say Real Madrid won’t come back! Really! These three come backs! Wow
Listening to talk fumble is so beautiful
Fans may say that Real Madrid aren't out until its over and there are players that are gonna step up. However, Liverpool is the exact same way and they have the Clutch Late game scorer DIVOCK ORIGI. Just remember " You'll Never Walk Alone"
Steve Nicol said that Manchester City shouldn't slaughtered. I have to disagree, because you and the rest of your colleagues jumped into the Manchester City bandwagon. So much so that, every time a season turns over, City are the favorites to win the champions league. But now here we are couple of seasons later, Manchester City have always let you people down. And I have to say that Manchester City deserves to be slaughtered
Stevie saying that city shouldn’t be slaughtered but he did the same to Chelsea, is no one seeing this hipocracy
Camavinga is a baller. Saved Real Madrid once again.
The final gonna be just one game so we will see
Madrid brought on Rodrygo, Camavinga, Asensio, Ceballos, etc… underrated squad depth
Not a Madrid fan, but gotta love them for kicking out the oil clubs out of the tournament 😂
Believe no man 1️⃣🇪🇸
Yes, please continue to downplay Madrid. You people never learn. Didint even mention the RM chances, and talking as if city dominated the second 90mins. Absolute jokers, not pundits.
Ale brought up a great point City haven’t been able to see games through look at the athletic game in the final minutes of that game they had a lot of chances to not only tie the game but win the tie you have to be ready for that
No, Ale, you were wrong. I believed even at 88th that Real would come back. Many other Real Madrid fans, we believe, because honestly, we see football in an unbiased lens than all of you.  As Madridistas, we belive to the very end
Oil FC bottle it ! 🤣 hahahaha.   Great to see all that endless money from a FFP cheating club literally owed by a country still can't buy the European Cup! 🤣 Come on Salah you owe them one! YNWA
honestly i rather see real and liverpool in the final than city...city is just like the bully who is tough on outside but soft on the inside
Let’s just say being a Madrid fan is gonna cost me my voice box lungs and throat when Rodrigo scores first goal level of me and my brother screaming at 5 the second goal came the level of screaming went from 5 to 100,000,000 unbelievable
Don't forget the "professionals " had Madrid losing against every team we played 🤣 HALA MADRID
Unbelievable ✌️
English pundits just can’t accept that RM has better quality than £1 billion Man City. Here is Stevie saying they did nothing in the first 90 min to suggest they should be in the game. Vinicius missed an empty net from Cavahal. He was pushed from behind by Walker as Modric played a through ball to him. That was a red card. Ref just brushed it off. Benzema had a wide header than he should have netted. RM created quality chances than Man City for the first 60 minutes but their finishing was poor. Here is Stevie out here trying to make us believe Madrid did nothing.
Liverpool will demolish real Madrid
Pep removing Debruyne is what changed the tie.
Fixed game ref gives extra time during 90 minutes for real M to score and finish the game before 3 minutes extra time which it wasn't allot Casemiro should have been send of for tackle from back which it was clear yellow ref didn't give him and 2 time another yellow nice gift from ref :):)
Madrid is more than conquerors through Christ who strengthens them.
Is Stevie that thick? You can’t criticize Pep because it’s the players’ fault… but when PsG capitulated in 9 mins v Madrid with 2 defensive errors and a GK mistake it’s on him??? Seriously?? Double standards
Ale better not jinx us 😅😂 Hala Madrid
Pep choke again!!!  Man fail. They gave him cash 💸💰🤑club players..
I believed
We have a lesson to learn about this team  Self believe is a overwhelming powerful thing
This champions league proved oil money can't defeat passion for the club
These f**ks should lose their jobs
Keep writing off Madrid, I love it.
City need a keeper & a striker
Oh how they love to kiss pep guardiola's behind. The man that had spent money like no other team in this planet out of the champions league.
Hahahahaha I love how sad they are 😂😂😂 Hala Madrid!!!!!! By the way Madrid had a lot of chances what game were this fuckers watching?
Cryyyyy city fans
It's simple. Real Madrid lays quicksand in UCL
ANYONE WHO WATCHED THE GAME BETWEEN REAL AND SEVILLA SHOULD HAVE GIVEN MADRID A CHANCE TO GO THROUGH
Everybody wrote us off now look at us now .. keep hating
This was a lesson in the importance of the mental part of sport and life. City lost thus cause they aren't mentally able to cope with big ucl nights. You don't give up 5+ ucl winning positions cause of lack of skill
Where's Shaka
I really wonder if these guys actually watch these games, to suggest that City actually outplayed Real over the two legs.
Benzema did nothing in this game.
Moreno telling city to play like mourinho  is so ironic
Madrid❤️ proving the 🌎 wrong
Steve should stop commenting about football 😂😂😂😂
…but it can last for another 90 min, careful what you wish for Stevie
Excuse Excuse Excuse they will not learn
RM winning number 14 with a last minute comeback on Liverpool. Calling it right now. Its destiny, fate, whatever you wanna call it, but this has already been written and we're all just living it out.
Real 2 liverpool 1
Karimontadaaaa
Stop making excuses for poor city, they have never won CL and always collapse at this stage so stop acting like they've won it before.
Laporte handball in the first leg shouldn't have been awarded  its the rules of football
ESPN panelists will always have to eat their words. hala Madrid. hate on Madrid more barca fan page. 😂😂😂😊
Steve wouldn't dare to slaughter city before the final🤣 cold hearted REAL MADRID.
Shitty and Poole going down.
Never seen anyone more salty than Stevie Nicol. Makes ZERO mention of the sitters missed by players like Vincius, if Vini puts away that open goal at the start of the 2nd half, it’s a different game from then as well, yet there isn’t a single mention of that. A very inaccurate recollection of the how game played out, City, in no way shape or form “absolutely dominated Real Madrid for 90mins”
These guys analyse is amazing  team scores two goals,  and say they're out runned
As a Liverpool fan I am sooo happy we don't have to play City. Well done Madrid for knocking out the 3 sportswashing clubs
This what exactly happens when you look down upon a God in the UCL competition and write them off!! You’d have no words to explain once the pull the unexpected off!!!! The History of this game should teach you a lesson that logic dont always work in Football!!!!!!!!!!
10 seconds in and ale already wrong Real Madrid was not dead
Ale is so spot on about Man City
M Salah we are coming for you 😎😎😎
Question which team is worst in ucl PSG OR MAN CITY?
Now let real chew Liverpool alive in paris
I can't say the better team won, but what I can say is RM is making this CL knockout stages more fun with unexpected suprises
While everyone says that klopp and pep are the best in the world. Carlo Ancelotti: 🤨
This English team favoritism is ridiculous. Vini also missed an easy chance at the beginning of second half, but it's all about chances missed by City. Atletico in second leg clearly showed how fragile City can be when other team put pressure on them. And as for Liverpool, they had one of the easiest path to final in Champions league history.  They haven't faced a single elite club in the knockout stage. So stop bullshitting this English team bias.
Real Madrid : Are you not entertained???
As a Man city fan, This loss was not Pep’s fault. After Mahrez scored man city were poor. Their mindset was terrible, they were getting ahead of themselves and they were thinking the tie was over. Then when suddenly Rodygo scored two goals and turned the tie on its head, they were panicking. Then when Vardrid got a penalty and Penzema scored, their heads went down and the were playing to desperately.  The officials were also very sus. when Madrid were behind there was 6 minutes of added time and when man city was behind there was only 3 minutes of added time. THEN THE REFEREE BLEW THE WHISTLE BEFORE THE 3 MINUTES OF ADDED TIME. 🤯🤯🤯
Before the game Zidane channeled his inner black magic energy from the stands into Ancelotti   It's part of Real Madrid's pre match rituals in the Bernabeu
Man i hope Mbappé signs for us... as underdogs we've reached the final, imagine with him alongside Karim and Vini
Madrid remind me of Man Utd in the 1999 treble season. Noway they lost hope nor their shoulders dropped. Self confidence at its very best and the KEY for that is the presence of ppl like Vinicius, Rodrygo and Camavinga. power of youth!!! Vamos Madrid
I think liverpool will win quadruple this season, there something missing in man city this season, their mentality not same as last season
Why would they ever want to change this game.. what a match 👏
game of the year no question, I'm a Barcelona fan and even I almost screamed when madrid scored their second and when the ref pointed to the spot, the champions league is just something else. Very excited for the 2018 rematch, hope Klopp wins his second title
What got me was that for the last few minutes Real played with great intensity and City couldn't handle it. Why did they wait til they were almost out to wake up? If they'd turned it on a bit sooner, they wouldn't have needed extra time.
Benzema is the Best in the world
Comeon Real Madrid are the king's in this competition...why would you sympathise with a team with the best squad in terms of depth and quality when they fail..this was good for football
Rodrigo is a great finisher.
Oil club hala madrid
Man city is the worst game closers ever, its terrible just as the first leg. Big shame and disgraceful
Why can't gab just give credit to real madrid ??
I dont see them beating liverpool so they better enjoy this
Poor club though had a chance against royalty they were stunned and will be paralysed for their lives
Pep is fraud he can only win team champions league with Messi
If mentality is part of playing football then stop with this nonsense that "Madrid has only been lucky and average". MENTALITY IS PART OF PLAYING FOOTBALL!!!
One of the greatest comebacks of all time..Hala Madrid ❤️🥺 what a feeling ❤️
Last leg I commented, that yes city outplayed us and were the better team, just like PSG and Chelsea they had the game in their hands but made the mistake not to kill us off and leaving it a 1 goal game,  Ofcourse everyone replied that to my comment that our luck was finished and cancelo this and walker that etc. but look at Madrid now. WE'RE GOING TO PARIS !! HALA MADRID   I always knew.
Mad respect to  Ancelotti Coutois Rodrygo Camavinga And Vini for keeping the pressure on city These guys really stood out
this panel is gutted
Liverpool fc will win 🏆 💪 🙌 👏
You have to understand this team has a lot of flaws, but that doesn't take away the hunger and determination playing in a Real Madrid shirt. Rodrygo, my goodness. Super sub.
Psg slaughtered  Chelsea slaughtered  Espn pundits: Man city don't need to be slaughtered   But their analysis is based on logic and not emotions
City remain like PSG, great pretenders.🥴
Comeon Chelsea...we are coming back stronger next season
Alejandro moreno defends madrid all the time♥️🇪🇸🏳️
Real Madrid are the new comeback kings!!! Really loving football and the champions league 🤣🤣🤣🤣😅 poor city fans right now lol
If away goals stood real madrid would have done a 1- 0 on city tonight...anyway still we'll master this new system
Manchester City not have enough focus on team defense, a little late to start at the end
Bro not Steve Nichols. This food absolutely hates Madrid
How can anyone doubt Real Madrid who has 13 champions league? I still don’t get it 🤷🏼‍♂️
Steve go home,you have no business with football.fake pundit
Liverpool is favourites really really.....!!!!!!!!! Vamos
PROUD TO BE A MADRIDISTA!
Hello liverbool we come again why you call us but you will  see final we are the king of kings in Europe Halla madrid
Hahaha English Fans and theirs journalist 🤣🤣🤣we are waiting at the final on your face 🤣🤣
Where is Ramos when you need to break a salah in 2022🤣
It makes no sense? Lmao the bald fraud messed up by taking out KDB and mahrez and Jesus, and you can never let your guard down against madrid we will always overcome 😂🤍
In the ucl madrid is graced by gods . Thats it . It doesn’t matter if they have the bus parked like atletico or the city of guardiola . And lets be honest . In terms of football they didn’t deserve it . The same against psg and chelsea . I mean usually the squad that creates more wins but not madrid. Its very very strange tbh. And this is not the only season . What is annoying are madrid fans when they say : zidane is genius ronaldo ramos are the best bc they won 3 ucl . Now with anceloti . If these people go to other clubs and the club plays like madrid today they are not doing it . Its as simple as that  . The perfect example is ronaldo with juve . I mean he played good(but the squad not) and  still couldn’t do it . The same with anceloti in bayern. Am telling you madrid in ucl has something mystic . Thats it . If you want another example anelkas madrid .( Today they say Ancelotti out masters pep 😂pep flopped. I don’t know what people smoke at this point )
I hope Liverpool wakes up and learn from PSG and City put Real to bed early don't wait late in the game it's gonna bite you in the end
I think city were even lucky to reach extra time cause madrid would have buried it in the first half
But we have Walker and Cancelo😂
We scored six aginst them but people are still giving excuses. We don’t have the best side in this world at the moment but we are madrid. We own the ucl. Those oil clubs and the experts should learn to respect the badge. Yes we didn’t play some greatest match but we are still the winners.
Real Madrid has great team approach
At the start of the season, when ali asked this fat old guy is there any chance of real to win champions league this season? He was laughing and insulting real madrid.
im not suprised city lost, they have been proven for the last 5-6 years they dont have the total package to take it all the way
These ESPN pundits should all just go and hide in shame....infact should all be sacked!
Laporte should have had a red for punching Modric in the chest & then slapping him, then diving. Modric got a yellow for getting slapped & punched. There were plenty of others, like 2-3 handballs from Man C.
Steve is already looking for reasons why Liverpool should win, almost as if he needs to prove that to himself. Hala Madrid
These men are gonna make city favourites again next season just watch...
I do agree Madrid were outplayed most of the time this season, but get Stevie out of this discussion. He's been saulty & his argument is rubbish for the 1st leg. Would rather listen to Ale, at least he's more logical
Y'all counted them out. I started watching this game at the 82nd minute and knew it was coming. I didn't think they'd get 3 but I knew it was going to extra time.
City fcked up when they left the door open in the first leg 🤣 they should've put Real to bed but rhey life the lifeline and now it came back to bite them yet again
I honestly though that madrid had a chance at the 86th min. i had seen madrid do this so many times that unless full time is up i still think madrid would come back.
Man Stevie is about to cry
The mentality of real Madrid is 2nd to none, as a barca fan I was shocked then amazed, this is why I love barca, we embarrassed Real Madrid all the time and they can beat the best in premier league in 15minutes of football over 2 legs. that's how dangerous they are! La liga is not dead, congrats Real, for once you deserve to be in a final, and not because of 3 offside goals and cheap Ronaldo penalties 🤣.
Ancelotti brought home "la decima" can he bring home 14th???? We'll have to see in the end of May
City has to be slaughtered like PSG
If the keeper doean't make a save ,, if mendy doesn't make the stop last time i checked thats what they are paid to do
too much talk before games
You guys must love pep tomuch and you don't give  credit where credit is due . The Madrid coach need a lot of love because of what his team has done. You all wanted city to win the champions league but for another season they don't. Hope you all learn a lesson that no matter what the struggle you don't give up the fight.
Stevie’s scared.
Stevie is right,this notion of ball-playing CBs is overrated,we saw TAA costing Liverpool yesternight,then in this tie Man City's Cbs were exposed,teams must play with defensively-sound defenders n not attackers in defense
Stevie makin 123864 excuses for Man City that he wouldn't make for Psg
Floppdiola fails once again.
Remember real beat psg chelsea and city to get finals while liverpool played benfica and villareal
Never Say Die Hala Madrid 🤍🤍🤍
None of Pep's teams have ever had grit. They play pretty and don't close out games. He's a great coach no doubt but Messi and Co gave this guy his career.
These ESPN FC pundits need to apologize or leave this panel, all of them said we won't get past PSG, no chance against Chelsea, and Man City. At least an aplogy need to be made.
I hope steve shutups for the next match ! God i hate him , he just can’t accept how great Real Madrid is .
pag deserves the critic, but not city?? hahahhhhah wow
There'd be no goals in football witout mistakes...okkk?????
RM KO: P$G, CHELSEA, MCITY …. Next Liverpool ? If they win the CL, ancelotti will win BEST COACH AWARD AND BENZEMA BALON DO’OR
Yeah you really have to wonder how that happened.... *cough ref was bribed *cough *cough
At the end of the final, the two teams would have a combined total of 20 CL. Only Milan vs Madrid could have bettered this. This is going to be historic. One team going for joint second greatest and the other for doubling the next best. History and prestige all over it.
City bottled it. What do you mean by individual mistake. If not Mendy mistake  in CFC 1st leg against Real Madrid would they be out?  Steve was fast criticizing PSG and Chelsea. Why not Man City ?..
Against all odds against all pundits against all the people outside Madrid Real Madrid proved they are the best in the champions league Hala Madrid yNada Na mas
Proved all of you wrong Messi fan boys fc
Feel sorry for Gab, didn’t get much words in 😅
Real this season are just incredible. May 28th is the most important date. The final won’t have 2 legs so they gotta figure it out. Can’t wait till next season with Mbappe and Rudiger.
This will feel even worse than losing in the final last season for Man City. They completely crumbled tonight.
They gave Real Madrid 6% chance of winning
MENTALITY MONSTERS: LIVERPOOL ……………………………………………… *& REAL MADRID⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️*
Can’t wait till they lose against Liverpool
Low scoring?!? This guy gets pay to “analyze “ he has no clue
After what we've seen tonight from city, I think they would never touch that trophy again,, sorry to say.  But they are always their own downfall....
Shame on you guys, brainless pundits and, no surprise cuz you guys were all Average players
What has happened to us is hurting.  We'll come back next season to win everything in one season. Casemiro should've been sent  out though but we move on.
Pep taking out his best ball holder "Mahrez" at the end of the game is one of the reasons RM came back, you need players who break the game and who know how to keep the ball against RM.
City didn't outplay Madrid in either leg. City didn't look like scoring and Mahrez scored a beauty. But with the intro of Rodrygo and Camavinga that completely changed the game.
They all said man city was going to win lol
I know these guys are devastated that we won’t be getting an all English UCL final in a few weeks 😂😂, Real Madrid vs Liverpool will be 🔥
I swear ESPN’s predictions are a lucky charm for Real Madrid! 🍀 please say that Liverpool will win. Also, if Madrid win the final then this will be their most epically dramatic UCL season EVER! Come on Madrid 1 more!! A por la 14!☝️⚪️🔵
🤭😂😂😂😂😂
"They didn't nothing over 90 minutes" what are you talking about they had chances but the strikers but on 90 minute of stinky performances, Madrid had more chance than City, but City hit the target most of the time. The fans were awsome
I am sorry but  Pep reputation will take huge hit after this, the manner they lost the final and this game also not good look. City reputation will also take huge hit!
You know you are dead when these espn pundits have you as favorites. You  are better off not playing at that point 😂😂
Noisy city, club built on illegal money and shoddy transfer dealings ,justice hs been served😅😅😅😅😅😅
Not gonna lie this only further makes me think pep is over hyped he has only ever  been in charger of dominant teams domestically and he only ever won the competition when he had Messi
real madrid just cross and inshallah. Theyre the best at it
These arrogance EPL bias pundits needed to be slapped. Well done Real Madrid. Evey top European league has its own Identity.
Cry English pundits cry...🤣...hala Madrid!
This is United 99 CL final level of absolute bonkers
Papa perez fixing the matches 🤣🤣
so we win a game and it’s voodoo?? rodrigo scores two wonderful goals and he barely gets mentioned 💀. if that were ever foden
Ale's analysis is just flawed...  The analysis is simple Real Madrid won, Man city lost. Can espn stop finding excuses for Man city every time the lose
Manchester City simply do not have the Spirit to win the CL while Real Madrid got that in their veins.
I didnt believe in rodrygo b4 but now i gotta admit i do
Dead!! Then Boom!!!!
Well said moreno!
Bruh we’ve been doubted every single game in the knockouts lol
As a Madrid fan. I threw in the towel at the 88th minute. BUT. As soon as that 1 goal went in, I knew. I just KNEW it would be another magical night at the bernabeu and Madrid would win !
If RM wins the final,It will be the Greatest CL winning run ever✨  Doesn’t matter if RM wins the final or not ,Benzema deserves the Ballon d’Or🤴🤍.
"I want Real Madrid" Nichols. This will not age well.
Pep's subs changed the game. The attitude of the players dropped as they all thought they were tru.
It was them same as Egypt vs Portugal...we believed Ronaldo is gonna score... exactly...90th min today..we believed we are going to score. that's the real Madrid spirit. We have to win.
Real Madrid played like a movie
I can't wait for Real to slaughter Stevie beloved LiVarpool 😂
Benzema ballon d'or 2022
you can tell steve nicol is shittinh himself. Madrid gonna win the 14th CL !!!
If you going to say real Madrid goals came from mistake what would u say about city goals real Madrid defense make sum huge mistake
Ale is Madridismo. ❤️
The English bias keeps shinning through again and again. Might be a Barca fan, but in UCL you never ever write these guys off. I wish Barca had the mentality these guys show.
Didn’t we beat Liverpool 3-1 last 2/3 times?
So over the two games City lost the tie but the narrative is that City is better?
Stevie's sweating bullets LMAO
The final will truly be the clash of the mentality monsters. I am still amazed that Liverpool didn't bottle it last night but Real Madrid did something truly magical
Benzema cleansing football from oil filth PSG, Chelsea and Man City is truly Ballon'Dor worthy.
Steve is right. City defense is not good enough to win CL. Its not Burnley or Watford. Its Madrid.
Ronaldo spirit jump into Rodrigo 😂
Real Madrid carrying UCL all by themselves...Producing games of the season again and again
I love the smell of burning oil money in the evening. Hala Madrid!
What these guys don’t realise is the match is not over till the final whistle is blown.. haven’t you any idea how many times we have scored right at the death?!?
ESPN pundits should quit their job.
All defenders make mistakes, look at the first leg Real Madrid made horrible errors, but the individuals won't be criticized. Now they are salty once Real Madrid made a comeback, they start blaming City defenders.  The world against Madrid
love the tears from some of these lot
being champions of Spain means you can as well top the EPL. La Liga and EPL haters take it or leave it
Nobody talk about Camavinga but he changed the game.
Someone needs to photoshop or make a .gif of Michael Myers wearing a Real Madrid jersey lmaoooo, this team just never quits or dies, the players deserve all the credit for still fighting and leaving blood sweat and tears on the pitch against all odds. I love this club, the best club of all time! Hala Madrid Y nada mas! 🇪🇸⚽️🤍💙
its funny how these called experts have no evidence or a feeling that madrid can turn this around? even tho they have done it twice already and now three times...we all have seen city choke several years in a row now but still they will not choke now?🤔
i hear a lot of english bias from stevie
Camavingas introduction into the game initiated all 3 comebacks for Real Madrid in the knockout games! Hope Ancelotti starts him in the final ahead of Kroos!
They have a monstrous mentality. I've heard the phrase "Die to live" and it looks like it's made for them. To win against the current Real Madrid, Two goal difference isn't enough let alone one goal difference. You have to completely destroy them, take your chances, and step on them to win. Otherwise, you're doomed.
Real Madrid are too good
Haaland and mbappe definitely looking at Madrid like 😍🤩
nah it was obvious in the 89th min bc this is madrids script
HALA MADRID!!!
Real Madrid were better than City throughout the game, only reason it got this late was because Vinicius and Benzema kept missing chances, clown pundits. I'm convinced they don't watch games.
And some idiots in the name of uefs officials want to take away the two leg semi finals
Everyone will talk about Courtoius, Benzama, Modric. But truth is, this season’s success belongs to the youth.  VINI. RODRIGO. VALVARDE. CAMAVINGA. Without them we would have been no where. Hats off to the recruiters.
I'm happy we play Liverpool in finals, facing city in the finals would have been too much.
Such gloomy faces lol
They're definitely gonna win it. Everything they say, happens the other way around 😂
Any team that beats PSG, CHELSEA & MAN CITY deserve the CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 🏆
Throwback to yesterday when they entire panel picked City. How stupid do you feel?
Real is going to win the final mark my words
Can’t wait for Frank to say Madrid didn’t play well, it was Manchester that played bad.
I see nothing but clowns here
Oh slaughter my team PSG but not Manch. city??? Messed up man
Ancelloti has guile . Bringing in Camavinga and Rodrygo.
Yall always talk about the mistakes Madrids opponents make but never the mistakes Madrid make. Its always the opponent was bad and never that Madrid was good.  Madrid was horrible in the first leg. Alaba Militao and Carvajal made soo many mistakes but of course the pundits single Diaz and Laporte for their mistakes because the only reason Madrid won was because City bottled it. The bias against Madrid is sickening.
I said it awhile back that man city will not win it these pundits are the worst all these guys are just premier league boosters all they care about are premier league teams man city and PSG ARE NOT  top teams idc who on earth tell me otherwise I will say until the day the world ends yet everysingle year i have to listen to these idiots predict that man city will win it all guess what as soon next season starts guess who these idiots gonna say are the favorites MAN CITY 😅 haaland is gonna arrive and the same thing will happen
ESPN FC  “Experts”  can you please apologize?
The thing about Real Madrid is that when they see that they can win the game, they start to get momentum, and once they get momentum there’s no way of stopping them because they have the strong team mentality and that’s what other teams don’t have and speaking as a Barca fan that’s what Barcelona needs to gain in order to compete in Europe
Real Madrid are the MOST entertaining football team EVER!
Never ever should you underestimate Real Madrid!!
Estos quieren llorar jjajajajajajja
Let's all give Liverpool an early congrats to winning another UCL ... Because ain't not Bernaboogie magic happening on a neutral field in Paris vs LFC ... Nice run Madrid 🫠 ✌️
To be fair, Man City are just a rich Tottenham Hotspurs....Expensive Bottlers....!!
Hahaha
Camavinga brought life to that midfield
Liverpool and real madrid showed what it means to be a big club that is grounded in history and knows how to never give in. City is just playing so grate football
Yesterday espn Frank , Alle , Craig all of them said man city will win cause Madrid were lucky!  Madrid eliminated Ligue 1 champions ( PSG ) Chelsea currently 3rd in PL also former CL winner  And now Man city 1st place in PL.. All this and you call it luck
Madrid have had tremendous heart and desire to win. It might not be convincing but champions find a way to win even when they play badly. I'm convinced they will put in their best performance in the final. Madrid 3-2 winners in Paris. Vamos!
Who ever still says luck to me is dumb sorry to say because this is not luck this is football
There is a legitimate gap in technical ability between Madrid and City but people are overstating it IMO. The biggest difference between the sides is that intangible called championship heart. Man City are strategic giants and a well drilled technical machine BECAUSE of that it takes them to the cusp of greatness BUT when they get there and get punched in the mouth they are forced to rely on things that you can't coach. That's not natural for them so THEY FLINCH. Real Madrid does not flinch, no matter the circumstances. CAMPEONES!
On a side note 📝, how was Alejandro Moreno a striker but only scored 3 goals in 47 international games??
The fact that real Madrid is still in transition,
Real Madrid never know when they're beaten you have to give them a huge amount of credit for that.
Mbappe must be wishing he left right about now😂🤣
Feeling sorry for Pep😂
I actually think the Walker substitution was the game changer
Always can count on Real Madrid when it seems impossible.🙏🏿💪🏿⚽Los Blancos Forever,go home with your foolish odds English media we r Unstoppable.#14
Some thing about teams scoring on Madrid just unlock a different beast in Real
The Oil team hat trick for Madrid
Real Madrid’s UCL run this season is literally a 1 in 10 trillion chance. It shouldn’t be possible. This UCL run will NEVER be repeated. We are literally witnessing something legendary, not just in football history, but in sports history. It’s just breathtaking
EPL THE BEST LEAGUE IN THE WORLD BY FAR THEY ALWAYS SAY LOL. I LOVE THE CAPPPPPPP
I learnt two things today.  1)Momentum is the most important thing in Champions league knockout stage. 2) Never write off Real Madrid.
PSG , CHELSEA , MAN CITY , LIVERPOOL. WOW WHAT A RUN BY REAL MADRID.
Please support Liverpool for UCL. Whenever you guys support the opponents, we win.
Can we have an apology from all the 4 ESPN pundits who called it for City Yesterday?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 (4 laughs)
ESPN fc still find away down play Madrid win 🤣 super natural the word they used lol
How will the entire ESPN fc family crew explain to future generations that Real Madrid lost 6 halves of football in a row and won 3 games? Hala Madrid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
City always take there foot off the gas when games became too easy I know one day something like this going to happen hope they learn from this
Well done madrid from a Chelsea fan..go and smash those scousers
Respect must be earned i said dat in 2018 against liverpool...here we go again
Without the save of courtois.. Without the save of mendy... Excuses and excuse again it is like that real players should not defend so to make this clowns right... You are ridiculous and real humbled you again
I bet you Frank is going to say Real Madrid didn’t win this game, city lost it.
City should have buried Real in City. Too many missed chances. Only themselves to blame. PSG, Chelsea, and now City made a fatal mistake. They believed that were the favorites, they listened to the pundits telling them that were the favorites. In the UCL you are never the favorite especially against a side who has won it 13 times. That’s not luck. That’s experience. You underestimate them and don’t take your chances in the 90 minutes given, they will hurt you.
I really wish I understood spanish... im sick of these english pundits
Horrible pundits, how was Real Madrid dominated??
It's not all English champions league final after all. English media over hyped loser man city.
BEST CLUB IN THE HISTORY OF FOOTBALL ⚽️
The whole ESPN panel should be Sacked, rehired and Sacked again😂🤣
And again, next year, every one of these analysts will pick Manchester city to win it all!  I guess they think if they keep picking this squad, they’ll finally get it right. It’s time to stop putting all the chips on this squad. Of course, if they do land haaland, all bets are off
Ronaldo dominated Champions League so insanely that now Real Madrid as a club have this paranormal belief they will always win. They got burned the last two seasons but it wouldn't surprise me if they ended up beating Liverpool again.
Pep doing his best pecho frío impression and Messi would be so proud... Both needed prime Xavi, Iniesta, Puyol and Alves to have any sort of relevance in Europe. It's been over a decade since Pep won the Champions League despite having spent billions.  Clough, 2 in 12 months. Paisley 3 in 4 years.  Zidane. 3 in 3 years. Klopp. Chance for 2 in 3 years.   An almost impossibly bad record for the spend. But hey, someone will still spin it as "genius".  Could've easily signed a striker in the summer but instead decided on a $100m bench warmer, lmao...
That was not a penalty Ruben got the ball. Madrid is the most fraudulent teams I have ever seen. The ref was absolutely shocking!!!!
ESPN pundits how about Start the show by saying "WE WERE DEAD DEAD WRONG" 😂
isnt courtois a part of the team? should he concede goals?😂
The English media keeping the narrative that Madrid are the underdogs and that they should be the ones loosing. You guys have just been looking in the wrong direction the whole time. This is not luck. This is pure talent, strong will, and passion. This is real football. El ADN sigue.
At this point I'm convinced that someone is using Real Madrid as a FIFA team, what great moments have they given us! Hala Madrid!
ESPN crew can cry now. Their predictions are once again proven wrong. Maybe this will teach these pundits to be more humble and give everyone recognition of having a chance.
This team is the luckiest team in history. It’s crazy how lucky they get. Luckily it will end vs. Liverpool 💪🏿😤
Benzema is 100% going to win the Ballon D'or this year: -UCL finalist. -UCL and La Liga top scorer. -Supercopa de España champion. -La Liga champion.
Listen to the city cheerleader. Man city weren't that good tonight
Espn a bunch of clowns
😂😂😂I stayed up until 1am after the match to watch these pundits take back their disrespect for Real Madrid.. But man these guys are stubborn, Nicol, wow! 😂😂 Those Carletto subs though 🔥, I remember Carlo was reluctant in using subs or overall changing the team in the first half of the season, now he has channeled that Zizou B team magic from 16/17, and it's been a dream.. Don't wake me
ESPN pundits😂😂😂
great opening speech from Moreno, well said!
Man City the new spurs of the champions league. 😁
I was waiting 😆
Camavinga came on and bossed the game vs PSG,Chelsea and City while pedri gets knocked out of the europa league and plays well against teams like Espanyol but people still think he's better 😹😹
Where is experts that predicted?
The French champions, the European champions, the English champions, and soon maybe even the future English champions!  Stop saying its luck, its not luck, ITS MADRIDISMO!
haha man city suck west ham better :)
Even Manchester United will not disappoint us like City did today
Espn prediction each time goes wrong. Real madrid is lifestyle.   Next season you know what we are getting 🫣
All that money spent and Man City still can't get their hands on the CL trophy you can't help but laugh at the hilarity of the situation.
When it comes to the CL both Man City and PSG aŕe cursed 😂 I'm still shock
Let’s all laugh at this clowns 😭😭😭🤡🤡
Twenty-One Things I Learned From This Game: 1. Madrid deserve to go to the final 2. UEFA once again bailed out Madrid (VAR) 3. Man City are PSG North 4. KDB disappears in big games 5. English fans and pundits are more arrogant than they are knowledgeable 6. Only player slower than Modric is KDB 7. KDB whines a lot and doesn’t really care to chase the ball 8. Pep cannot win the CL without one of the greatest teams ever assembled  9. Foden spends his free time looking for his “precious” 10. Grealish spends more time looking at himself in a mirror (and probably jerking off) than practicing  11. Sterling is pretty much a midtable player at this point 12. Carvajal is very under appreciated 13. Walker is a baller 14. Casemiro learned very well from Ramos the dirtier side of football 15. Without KDB, City have creative ability of Burnley 16. “Vini’s” is only really good at running fast in a straight line 17. Pep dressed appropriately for the occassion 18. There is something to this Real mystique  19. Benzema is exhausted from carrying Madrid all season long 20. There was at least one Chivas fan at Santiago Bernabéu (shoutout to the good people of Mexico) 21. We all should a have a pretty good and exciting final to watch. Good luck to both teams and their fans. (I still can’t stand Madrid fans, most are useless cheerleaders)
ESPN I hope that you guys will stop sidelining Real Madrid. We fight till the end.
Yaya Toure's agent, Dmitri Seluk in year 2018 following Guardiola's treatment of Yaya, said Pep Guardiola will never win the UEFA Champions League again because of an African voodoo curse, that was placed on him for treating Yaya Toure badly.
Farmers out
Porfa digan que va a ganar el liverpool porfa vor !!!
Liverpool wil win the CL this year revenge of 2018.
These pundits forgot that Casemiro came back!! 🛠️⛓️
1 more point vardrid without penaldo in champions league finals  Barcelona without  messi grouo stage europa league 😢
On another note. The fact Casemiro was substituted without receiving a yellow card is criminal. Refereeing was awful
City are bottlers hala Madrid
When the entire ESPN crew predicted City going through that’s when I knew Madrid was gonna go through  They almost never get anything right 😂
I fell asleep after 80minutes😭😭😭
Don't take it too hard Messi FC crew. Things like this are bound to happen when you play against the 13 time champions.
Real Madrid were clearly the better team but Benzema & Vinicius had a stinker this game. Man C were actually more clinical this game with chances created & goal scored.(for their standard) Thus, Rodrygo coming in changed the game because he brought a clinical aspect that was the only thing missing to Real Madrid. Real Madrid put so much pressure & defending so well... I don't know what they are talking about Real Madrid being dead.
they are ashamed😂
How ESPN pundits have audacity to underestimate this Real Madrid team again and again.
THIS IS MADRID!!!⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️
Surely this is a headline 2017 Real Madrid fans wwere expecting.
Only barcelona can  claim vardrid are their whipping boys their sidekicks for over a decade how messi scored 40 goals and assist against vardrid who own the refrees and var is just insane
Football Heritage >>>
You can have as much belive and desire, but it means nothing without the quality. All the pundits are going to choose Liverpool to win UCL final yet, they'll be asking the same old question. How did Madrid did it again?
That guy who talked first talks too much He seems to be an intelligent analyst but he is not. Long explanations
Madrid win Champions league City win Premier league Chelsea win FA Cup  After all the talk of a Quadruple, would be funny if this happens to Liverpool.
"Benzema has some things from Sterling"  Some BT Sport comentator probably.
Hahaha keep underestimating us pls ESPN crew
😎🤍
Please predict Liverpool in the final 🙏
Nonsense real madrid had their chances. City was tentative and scared a lot of the time
Those pandits were making fun of Real Madrid before the match 😂
Why do they torture us with these pundits.
And ESPN gave Madrid a 10% chance to go thru to the final. And now Madrid kept all these pundits mouths shut. We are the kings of Europe. Never count out Real Madrid. Man City are a bunch of bottlers 😂😂
I find it difficult to understand how people manage to doubt Madrid. There should never be a match where Real Madrid are the underdogs, never.
0 shots on target until the 90th minute. 3 mins later they had 3 shots and 2 goals. It could've finished before extra time. If Liverpool are called mentality monsters i don't know what Madrid are. I hope Liverpool wins it. Gonna be a epic final
Dear, when you face Real Madrid, you must fasten your seat belt in the 80th minute and the 90th minute 🚨 I hope my message arrives 😌🤫
HALA MADRID AND ALL THE PUNDITS PICKED MAN CITY 😂😂
Pep made a mistake taking off Kevin de bruyne and Riyad mahrez. Thought already ended 🤔
Hardest fight to the final: The Dream team(PSG) The holders(Chelsea) The "best league in the world" Champions(Man City) Hala Madrid!!
Can this guy's support Liverpool in the finals please because they always predict the opposite of what's going to happen
Dear, when you face Real Madrid, you must fasten your seat belt in the 80th minute and the 90th minute 🚨 I hope my message arrives 😌🤫
Every Manchester United fan and any decent football fans  will be behind Real to get the better of LiVARpool in the final.
We want to see how the studio reacted
The mentality, the sheer determination this Madrid team has is incredible. They play like they know they will win. U just can't bet against them. Wow just wow.
INCOMING ESPN FC LIVERPOOL BANDWAGON
Told You after first leg Madrid will shock you all ❤️👑🇪🇸
Bruh Ali talks excessively in a circle. Gab should only talk about Italians and Stevie not the same without Shaka or Criag beside him. L
Match of the season again💯no doubt!!  ESPN pundits should not say sh*t except Ale Moreno.. the only Pundit who gave Madrid a chance to advance
Unthinkable? Stop covering yourselves,the score was 4-3 , nothing unthinkable here
they write them off but they keep comin backkk. vamos
Manchester city fan here.... Still speech less
HALA MADRID
KARIM THE DREAM IS UNSTOPPABLE!!! HALA MADRID!
KNOCKED OUT MESSIS NEYMARS MBAPPES PSG  KNOCKED OUT DEFENDING CHAMPIONS CHEALSEA KNOCKED OUT MAN CITY AT THEIR PEAK MADRID IS LEGENDARY ⚪️
All these guys wrote off Madrid haha. It’s really funny honestly.
Real Madrid is the greatest thing that can ever happen to a human. We win against all odds and go thru against deniers. Real Madrid it's not a label, but a life style.
which manager will lead Man City to win their 1st ever Champions league trophy?? 🤔
BEND OVER BARCA 🤣 JUST BEND OVER 🤣 NOW TRYING TO PRETEND TO BE BENZU FAN TO SLATE RONALDO 🤣  LIFE IS AMAZING MAN 🔥 THAT ONE CHEATING OF THE 7TH BALOND'OR IS TOTALLY WORTH IT NOW 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 KARMA IS THE BEST THING 🔥🔥🔥🔥 BEND OVER
ESPN:”psg are bottlers”  Man city: “hold my two goal advantage”
I want to hear these English biased pundits switch up on their original talks earlier.. Please learnn. YOU DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE REAL  MADRID IN THE  CHAMPIONS LEAGUE. Now you all look like fools. I'm glad.  HALA MADRID!!!
It was a staged Match and all the officials was Italian that Referee was a joke and casimero escape without being book is beyond me he shouldn't even last 45mins 🟥
Man City msy have the oil money but Real Madrid have the history.
Real Madrid literally told ESPN FC to HOLD MY BEER…💯✊🏽
Real never disappointed ☹️
I went to get my friend saying that we got a goal back and still have time but in doing so I saw the ball going in the net. I thought it was the replay of Rodrygo celebrating but NO it wasn't, it was the 2nd goal and I legit screamed my lungs out. Hala Madrid
Like fraudiola said he was lucky to have messi to win it. These pundits can eat their words 😂
£100Mil for Grealish😂😂
Ain’t gonna lie Real Madrid truly saved football from another dreadful all English UCL final.
Top 10 bald managers  1.  Zidane 2. Erik Ten Hag 3. Stefano Pioli 4. Jorge Sampaoli 5. Sean Dyche 6. Tony Pulis 7. Bob Bradley 8. Steve Kean 9. Luis Felipe Scolari 10. Brian McDermott  Fraudiola? not even top 10 in my book.
Man City champion League Bottlers 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🥰😍🤩
Honestly stop putting those 3 goals stats for Ale
Pep is only problem team is good
Why tf isn't Craig on??? I don't understand how and why ESPN Chose the most boring panel of analysis to review this iconic match..
Where is the EPL clowns now that we're talking garbage?! Where are they?!
Hala madrid  You all doubted us
Never sleep on Madrid!! Hala Madrid!!!!
Pep’s worst defeat in Champions League history hands down. Losing a 2 goal aggregate lead after 90 minutes is unheard of.
*Madrid is jus made for champions league.*
Never ever underestimate us. We are football heritage. Best club in the world.
Real Madrid, I know you had it in you , great win
Name: Real Madrid  Job: Making ESPNFC look like idiotic clowns since existence.
Money can't buy mentality.
Viva Madrid 🔥🔥🔥🔥
