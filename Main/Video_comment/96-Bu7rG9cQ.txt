HOW DO YOU NOT LIKE CINNAMON GUM
The second i clicked on this video i felt like natalie was gonna be one of the items
Woah, I thought he died
Youtube is getting really comfortable with these double unskippable ads...
ITS CONFIRMED DAVID DOBRIK CONFIRMED IT FISH DO GET THIRSTY
David saying that flame thrower got him through a lot is terrifying.
What was the song at the end????
Man I miss his vlogs
gang gang
AYEE YESSIR I USE SUAVE 3 IN 1
Looks like David has tanner on his arms lol
I can’t live without my Natalie 🥺
I love the fact he uses swave kids that is probably the best thing ever
I only wear black leggings and people judge me... I bet David won’t. He gets me. He gets my reasonings.
Funny placement of his ring eh
U FORGOT LIZA!!!!
Bruh imagine not be able to use your phone will charging
this entire video was a  series of advertisement!
999
All the video feeling like 10:05 ...
Are we going to start putting bets on if David’s house will fall of the hill first or if he will burn it down first
whats the music at 11:48
Call mr beast
STOP USING 3 IN 1
Ahahha every phone that ivd owned hasn’t died
Wow you can’t even make your own videos cmon. David we are all waiting
COME BACK DAVID!!
"Oh no the cheese fell off!" The genuine concern on his face 10:13 😂❤️
Nothing like needing a flamethrower
When he said 15k my heart stopped😂
The case isn’t lame is fire 😎
bro the pillow is $100   O_o'
cinnamon is the best
11:20 just use deodorant bruh
nice
Anyone else surprise he didn’t have chipotle
brain, heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, stomach, intestines, bones, skin, blood                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             named them
David: It is not on Car: Haha car go WEEEEEEEEEEE
7:11 Why don't you put Natalie between your legs
I think David’s waiting for a suave kids 5 in one:shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste and deodorant all in one bottle!
He looks like a younger John krasinski
I cba counting but it feel like he showed us about 40 things 🤷🏾
I must be deaf but i never heard anyone ask?
Flossing is a good thing 👍🏾
Lol that shocked me at first when he said the pillow costed 15k ...
10 things mrbeast can't live without
David is the most adorable yet the hottest person ever!!!
8:58 I love David Dobrik
hes so adorable
Is this what your new perfume smells like?
The way David actually pulled of the lie that the pillow was 15,000 dollars and everyone was like yeahhhh
I like how he is like wow what’s in his mouth I wanna go talk to him...like yeah I’m just walking over to u bc u have green gum in ur mouth, definitely not bc ur David dobrik
I love him
He is so Rich and he is over here talking about kids suave
No one:  David casually buys a pillow worth 15k dollars
9:45 David just got friend zoned
Nobody:   David: casually firing hot flames in a room
Nobody:  David: this gums my favourite. This ones not so good but I have it to show u guys a different option 😂😂😂
Nobody:  David: this soap washes u all over ur body. 3 squirts on the head😂
Honestly I love how he doesn’t flash cars and money like rappers and athletes do he just shows off his shampoo an the joke And fun fact that comes on the back 😂
Why am I obsessed with David ? I’m literally 27 years old, If anyone has a good therapist let me know, please. 😕
When the chicago homies goin talk bout harolds chicken
imagine being problematic
ew
3:12 how is that even possible!!
David I officially hate you . Room temp water room temp nah
i cant get over the fact he has the 3 in 1 shampoo thing
David looks like he has a Vigina
David is the nicest person I have ever watched except Charli damelio
This is my first exposure to David Dobrik, and... wow. Who is this guy?
3 in one is truly terrifying
Why didn't he try oxygen??
David why'd you lie to GQ we all know you bought the kids tear shampoo because you thought if it got in your eyes it wouldn't hurt and you wouldn't cry. ;) <3
ok...it worries me he thinks that letting it just run down him is cleaning him. and also the 2 in 1s or 3 in 1s are usually not good for your skin cuz shampoo and body wash are extremely different lol. but I guess if it works for him then go for it
dave that shampoo finna make u go bald dude, 3 in ones not goood for ur hair :(
wow, I'm literally the same when it comes to sleeping. Gotta have something between my legs because it makes your back neutral and this is true look it up
I’m sorry but your number one should have been Natalie 😂😂😂😂😂
These people are really out here acting like they don’t need food or a house like smh
6:39 lmaoo
I wear black cause my pits are always sweaty! Oversized too!
GOD BLESS YOU SO SO MUCH
Feels like he's trying to sell EVERYTHING
Sad that one of those 10 things isn’t youtube ...
who tf drinks warm water
GQ- hey david wanna show us things you cant live without everyday DAVID- hey is it ok if i just do a 12 min advertisment for everything i have done or have stock in  GQ- sure they will still watch smh david
"woah what is in that guys mouth i wanna talk to him"
I use the same shampoo LOL
He’s crazy
I wounded what David’s disposables might be mistaken for?🤔🤔🤔
I like how he said that pillow was 35 or 40 bucks and I was like wow I'm gonna buy that and then realize its actually 100....
oh david, not the 3 in 1 shampoo
Omg david dobrik uses a 3 in 1
11:18 Honey that's an *arm full* ....
Me: *spots the shampoo bottle *         Its that kid's shampoo isn't it......        Of course.....
Was that a Denver nuggets shirt?
1980
Little table for mice
wait this is an old video
omg David please wash your body right...please!
TF who likes hot water?
Me: uses davids disposable  Also me: uses it at 8:59
6:36
Really guys..... no one commented about David ....I forgot what I was  about to comment
David is if you gave a 10 year old 10 million dollars is literally the epitome of his vlogs
nobody: David in interviews: suave kids no tear shampoo
HE MAKES HIS OWN AWARDS OMG DAVE U A LIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
whos gonna tell him you actually have to scrub your body to be clean
hayley kiyoko
Petition for covid to f*ck off cause I NEED David's vlogs again

https://onlyfans.com/jessicapeachh 🍑

I thought the trophy thing was Joe’s idea haha
Do the Don't Start Now dance
https://onlyfans.com/ranchcummings  My husband and I run a couples one 😁 It's free to subscribe!
This is my favorite show. The good actors make you feel that this is actually authentic.
i thought i was the only one addicted to gum, i get anxious if i don’t have it lol
why is no one talking about how adorable he is in this interview
hes such a child but its amazing to watch. he doesn't care about using kids shampoo or walking around with a tiny disposable camera even though there are so many other things he could bring up. genuinely such a funny guy
If David and Liza didnt break up Liza would be on this list
D charger thing is cool right ❤️👍
Apparently one of those things is saying the N word...
of course this mf uses 3 in 1
Lol
I also can't live without gum😁
9:45 wahhhht
He is a kid adult
This guy is a f***ing idiot 🤣🤣🤣
DAVID DOBRIK GET A REUSABLE WATER BOTTLE
Well he obviously CAN live without vloging..
Im the 124 810th like lol
"woah what is in that guys mouth i want to talk to him" - David Dobrik
davids: sauve kids!  tana: literally weed.
David noooooo 3 in 1 that’s so gross
It honestly does not surprise me that he uses kid shampoo
2:10 I thought Natalie was joking when she said he bathes with strawberry suave kids.
David needs to come out with charging cases
David is the new boonk gang lmao
theres no way i simp over a guy that uses 3 in 1
32
The dude drinks warm water....
for david’s perfume i think it should be called “DD perfume” but like the design could be one D facing to the right and the other D facing the left. idk LOL fun idea
how could anyone not love this man..... "haha two buttons. for saturday and sunday" cutest man alive
Cinnamon gum is good - what you Talkin bout'
real funny bruh
When you have the same hangers as David.
david is like when u give a 10 year old 10 million dollars
It’s funny how we thought he would show off cool as things and then I saw suave kids shampoo
Kids be like
a sleepover starter pack but replace the awards with toys
He used to not be able to live without Liza :(   I miss them so much
Great video. Needs more name dropping. LOL /s
This guy should do vlogs he seems like he'll be good at them
This is like kids room tour
made on my bday
does anybody know what sweater he's wearing?
David is the most interesting and boring person at the same time.
OMG DAVID ISNT WEARING HIS GREEN BRACELET WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!
great content bro
If I can't marry David I hope to God he marries Natalie!
anyone know what juice wrld music video it was ?
not the 3 in 1 wash
David get a nalgene. That’s a lot of plastic homie
i wish david was my bf lol jk ok not kidding nooooo im kidding 😁 he is very handsome tho an personality is everything
“Omg what is in that guys mouth i wanna talk to him”
fans listening abt shampoo for like 5 min just to hear him speak.
he is such a kid and so cute and adorable i love himmm
Is anyone else on a marathon for these 10 things I can’t live without videos? Once you watch one, you can’t stop😂
I know my next shampoo, like if you know!👍
Mans really brought a flamethrower
Nobody: David Dobrik:Free promo😈
so david acts like a kid and has kisd toys and shampoo  and thats y hes so exited on camera
Internet: ur racist    David: I'm not racist my entire closets black
He is so white 😭💀
what’s the name brand of the pillow
Is no one talking about the person who cared Natalie
bro that so me i cant sleep without my leg having a plow
Tell David to upload
so he will die if he doesn't use perfume
He can't live with out being racist should be on list
The way david just said oop when he was falling off his tesla on the table 😂
i don't know what is in your mouth
10:49 How it started going fast😭 this man is hilarious  😂!
GQ: Bleeps any word that remotely resembles a cuss Also GQ: 3:06 3:49
He lost weight,  good for him
eew david- warm water?
I want him to park that big ma- ok ill stop sorry
Dave is adorable
cinnamon gum is yum yum dumb dumb
For when you hate your neighbors, classic. 🤣🤣❤❤ you're funny
I thought the gum thing was just me
He has the personality of a kid🤣
FINALLY some one who understands my water temp preference!!
Once David realizes a modern camera can storage pictures on the computer....
Amazing
EW DAVID ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
You need to try a polaroid
Good to hear, you like drinking water now, u said last time u hate water
The gum trick was ...IT
all the cosmetologists watching david use 3-in-1 are yelling at the screen rn🤣
honestly davide will always be the last resort for natalie
Can you please give credit to the kid on tik fok for the disposable idea
Hi
I was about to smash my tv after david said his pillow was $15k
I was here for it until he had all them plastic water bottles - someone get this man a hydroflask.
david is like a little kid and i love it !!!
H? U
David when he said he needs something between his legs he is more sus than red in among us
David:-This is my Natalie Natalie:-😊
50 shades of black shirts. Same.
No, the one thing he cant live without is...        *Liza*
Tesla stock is better lol
I don’t know why but i’m literally soo happy that Natalie is one of the things David can’t live without 😊
this man reminds me of my uncle steve.. and it’s highkey bothersome
Sass ss
Essssesxs
Did David lowkey admit he only washes the top of his body properly then let’s the rest trickle down, and thinks that’s clean???
The thing about David is he’s floating in $$$ so I wouldn’t be impressed if his pillow actually costed 15,000 etc.
David: table for a mouse      mice: How convenient!!
I feel like David should get sponsored by Kids Suave Shampoo
That was a very long advertisement
😂why does he make me laugh so much
Didn’t mention Joe!!! EVIL !!! PURE EVIL !!!!!!!!
ffs can someone tell david to upload
Ugh its Joe
Is anyone else crying because of how terrible this is for the environment!!! 10 plastic bottles thrown away a day! and he's been using disposable cameras for two years!!! Please for the sake of our planet GET A REUSABLE WATERBOTTLE and you can get a camera that takes photos like the disposable ones except its reusable!!
Suave needs to sponsor Dave, seriously.
He should try re-usable bottles - all that plastic is so wasteful
Wheres Joe's credits
He looks very thin. Good for you David
" https://amzn.to/36PGjVE Get this super kurti this season of dusherra,diwali,bhai duj at celebratrati styles   🙏😘😍❤️ "
Shoutout to Joe Vulpis who they cut out when David credited him for giving him all the fake awards 🐐😂
Watching David talk about how water is one of his favorite things and it’s entertaining??
My phone has never died
DUDE cinnamon gum is my second favourite gum my first is vinnila
8:42 what a fkn liar. Joe makes them, give him some credit
He is such a likable guy
did he just admit to not washing his booty...no wonder Liza left. 😂
david did you watch avatar the last air bender
*That gum/shoe trick alone will give him COVID..*
why is he even famous
*He can't live without his...awards?? Im confused*
Me living in Chicago 👁👅👁
who is he?
Why is Noone talking about how he said he likes to drink hot water??
im here after tana mougaues video and i cant get over the camera
I drink 5l aswell
Anyone else getting John krasinski vibes?
If you drink 5 liters of water a day I'm pretty sure you die.
this video is just an ad at this point
He is goofy, cute, adorable, and most importantly  way too humble! showing off his kid shampoo xD ! We love u DD
I don't sleep. He's pretty funny
I agree with almost all of these
I love how the car is just in case he gets a dog 😂 not that he is getting a dog, but just in case 👏🏻
when david said his pillow was 15,000 dollars I wasnt surprised
@David using so much plastic :/
I'm surprised he didn't get a chipotle burrito
Wtf really wanted that pillow when it was 35$ but that shits actually 100$ and I’m sad 😞
The water bottles are such plastic waste, there should be better options.

This video has just furthered my absolute love of David Dobrik. <3
I'm with him on the water thing. I hate cold bottled water.
3:10 He’s definitely a frequent gum chewer. Dude opened it up to the piece in like a second 😂
I miss him with Liza 🥰
Y’all remember when David actually uploaded to YouTube?
I was chewing cinomin gum wile watching this
david: comes out with his own perfume  also david: uses 3 in 1
10:44 😂lol
7:04 same😂
Can someone sent me link to davids camera app for android
hi
This video made me really like David Dobrik
I look how someone so wealthy still enjoys the little things
a kid stuck in an adults body
David is the only guy allowed to use 3n1
So David Dobrik is a kid in a man's body basically.,
"this is my natalie' awwwwww
lol David is one of those guys that doesn't wash between his cheeks
Oh my god I have to have smth in between my legs when I sleep too and yes it sounds wired but imagine the situation when you are sleeping over in a friends house and you have to explain it
I'm at the bottom of the ocean now, and i STILL cant find who tf asked
Dave stop using disposable plastic water bottles!! Reduce using plastic!!!
This dork....I love him.😂😂😂💖
Hi

Omg omg talk to me please
JOE.
Why is no one talking about how he likes to drink water hot
Product placement, i almost believed the click bait
This is like David was doing a show and tell at his school and he's showing us his favorite toys
4:02 umm what juice WRLD video is he in?
"I think I drink about 5 liters of water a day"  *sips beer at 2:46am"
7:07 to 7:13 same
10:57 LITERALLY THATS WHY I WEAR BLACK TWO
Suave bout to start working on a 13-1
I know everything about David this is insane, I just need more vlogs, so desperate for David content!
Pfft amateur, I drink over 5.3 Liters of water per day. ;)
David can you please like this comment been a fan
P
Where can I buy me one of these “Natalie” things?
Why does Suave never do a collab with him???????
Oh my goodness, this spoke to my soul 😂 David's brain is my brain- i have 2 portable phone chargers which I switch out to always keep the charge up, I am a gum obsessive and have it everywhere for the reasons David said, and spearmint is my fave 😂, I drink like a fish (probably have about 20 large glasses of water per day) oh my. Lets be friends 😂
Yo, does anyone know what the exact name is of that pillow
Where to get Natalie? GQ didn't attach the link, David?
I knew Natalie has to be there😂
He protecc He attacc But most importantly HE'S BACCCC
POGGERS ITS THE TESLA GUY
Me eating cinnamon gum:   David: cinnamon gum is disgusting  Also me: listens to daddy as spits it on my grandma!🥰😉
I swear to all that is good, if DAVIDS PERFUME smells anything like Suave Kids- I’m gonna cry 😩😂
how could you not like him
Meeting him after 5 months on youtube!
uhhhh who even are you? get a job
by 2025 i will film with david. i’m typing this comment to put it into the universe.
david gives me straight james charles vibe
Title: 10 things David can’t live without  Me: SeatGeek
I love him even more. Room temp water hit different than any other temp
I actually like David videos, but this one makes my face look like "wtf" all the time, I think its a lot of sponsored products compared to what the title means.
you know what they say.....can't live without that nickelodeon rocketship.
Ayo when did he get to be in juice wrlds music video
He's just a big baby with a lot of money
I 100 percent agree with your opinions on gum
I want David dobrick so bad. His quirky sense of humor 🤪 is everything
Does this just keep getting re-upload or what?
you inspired me to do my own version of this that i've just uploaded if you could pretty please check it out! x
I Like David Dobrik and BlackPink Is Religion ! ^_¥
can't tell if he killed or resuscitated film photography.
ARA DAVEED
Does anyone have the link to that pillow?? 👀👀
“just a handful of shirts”
David's reaction to the cheese falling off his pizza was so cute 🥺🥺🥺
“This is my Natalie” AW I LOVE THAT
its the blue hat for me hahah so cute
I’m here after tanas video and I can’t with the amount to similarities
David doesn’t wash his feet
David, I’ve never been to a premier and don’t plan on ever going to one so right now my disposal camera will be pictures of me and my dog chilling on my couch in my pjs that I’ve been wearing for a few days. But this video make me want to get one 😂
Your so lucky to be in a juice WRLD muisc video I would kill to be in one of those rip juice wrld
i literally used the same shampoo when i was 8 and it was truly the best shampoo expieriance ive ever had
lol he thought this was show and tell
omg..omg..omg NEVER F-ing use 3 in 1. shampoo, condintioner and body wash. that trash ruins your hair.
pillow. its only $40. *looks it up* $100 pillow😮
when I tell you I slammed my hands on my desk in shock when you said $15,000 for a pillow....
6:15 Same 😂

https://youtu.be/qPVASFEt1ig
Uff the friend one hurts 😳 9:43
He’s a literal child but it’s adorable
Nobody’s gonna talk about how he looks like he is sitting on a chair you sat on in kindergarten
Who else agrees with David I always need someone between my legs
I'm also a side sleeper and I have that thing with the legs too! Always thought I'm a weirdo
david is the last guy i thought would use a 3in1 soap
David can you post
NAV ?
Omg David youre my twin i love having something in between my legs when i sleep :)
I'm surprised that he didn't say a paintball gun
That black t-shirt tip hits different👏👏
Awww COMMONNNNN. YOU SAID THE PILLOW WAS $45...well they jacked up the price to $100! Damnit...I hate when they do that to prices after they see somebody endorsed them. I wanted to buy that pillow, damnit! 👿 $100 is too much though.
not the 3 in one 😭😭
NOT THE 3 IN 1😭
plz help me reach 1000 and stay safe!!!!
So, a flamethrower is essential
He is so wholesome
the way david pronounces my name correctly
3:12  haha cringe
I finally found someone who like room temp and warm water!!!!!! Everyone said I was crazy
GIVE US A VLOG
This guy will do anything but a vlog
thi guys suckjs
Okay but why does it seem like he’s just advertising all these things😂😂😂
He so cute
Wait so does David really let the soap just run down his body and think that he’s clean 😬 Natalie pls get him a loofa
We all knew suave kids would make an appearance let's be real
My boy just said liters.  I'm so proud
https://noirandbelle.etsy.com
Yea
What happened? Why aren’t you uploading
Why is no one talking about him using kids shampoo?
Is this the dude destroying people insurance by gifting them Teslas?
why wouldnt you just buy a film camera?? so bad for the enviroment
Me reads 10 things david dobrik cant live without..me:does that includes liza?
i love him sm
So is it true that white people don’t wash/scrub the lower half of their body in the shower ? They just let the water run down?
THIS WAS JUST A WASTE OF MY TIME LOL
Sooooo unstoppable with all those black t-shirts but he’s right wearing black is always the way too goo lol
Why is no one talking about how adorable David is🥺😊
not the 3in1 david
I just love David Dobrik, he’s just so cute, I wanna squeeeeeze him. 😩😍🥺😘
non of the essentials are his essentials 😂
Can
Why is no one talking about him using 3 in 1 shampoo???!!!!!
I make my own awards, shows the awards joe gave him. Hahah
Omg me too fit my legs like a pillow LOL
HOW DO YOU HATE CINNAMON GUM!!!!!
That gum trick was sicckkk
2:21 That looks like a MLB dugout to me
I feel like David is still in his childhood with that shampoo
0:41 You could just upgrade to a wireless charger my dad has one and enjoys it
I feel like this was just one huge brand deal...
David taking credit for joes vloffice awards is exactly who he is. He takes other peoples ideas and quirks and makes them his own.
it’s the 3 in 1 for me
David Dobrik uses 3 in one... kids 3 in one....
I miss his vlogs
This kids 3 in 1 suave using mf put out a perfume line.
The more you watch the more you realize David is no different to a 12 year old boy
Who is this guy again?
this dude makes like 1 million a year and still uses 3 in one omg
Wow... GQ sucks.
when will straight men give up 3-in-1 products
''this is my natalie'' dfkgjkdjfgkdfj
Wait david is in a juice wrld music vid ... how did I miss that
David may already have sweaty palms  but too much water can also make it much worse. True fact though. There is a such thing as drinking too much water in a day. It pushes out essential things your body needs.
❣️
Not him using a 3 in 1😭😭😭
I thought Joe made those awards?
This is the best “10 things...” I have ever seen honestly
Dude I love cinnamon gum
"Crazy logo"  Where💀
"I have to have something in between my legs"
He uses kids shampoo?
My heart stopped when you said $15000 💀
Shampoo, conditioner AND body wash.... David sweetie no💀
Can you pleaseee start vlogging again
... not a 3-in-1
Literally to the 1% who’s reading this,God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day.💖 (my dream is to become a famous YouTuber) thanks .

Single use plastic bottles?.....just how evil are you?......     🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“ I have to have something between my legs"
Why you don't buy the new iPhone
He’s like a small child..

You forgot one david's micro size condom
We need the unedited full version of this
GREEN BAND, WHERE?
This is my natalie 😂
Finding out David uses a three in one might've been the worst moment of 2020 but it's so David
“sometimes I’ll wear a blue hat”  i lost it😂🤣🤣
Flamethrower, an essential. He needs to grow up!
Hiii
Omg I hate cinnamon gum too!
https://youtu.be/k6myXBenmgI
David Covid LOL😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂
"Making my own awards" - Joe made them. give him credit
When you realize it’s David’s Friends that are the funny ones.  Lol jk . But am I though? 😂
Literally to the 1% who's reading this, God bless you , stay safe and have a wonderful new day
He is a child. A big overgrown child.

Oh my god! OH my God!! OH MY GOD!!! WHERE'S HIS GREEN BRACELET??????!!!!
This is THE best interview 😂
i almost lost it when he casually said $15,000
Okay so I know y'all hear that David was in or going to be in a juice world video 4:00
“You either hit the gym or start wearing black” 😂😂
of course he’s a 3 in 1 guy
not the 3-in-1 ....
Question: Why does no-one in LA drink tap water? Plastic bottled water seems kind of wasteful and unnecessary imo
“i just started taking disposable pictures 2 years ago” yea that seems like yesterday
Dave why do you remind me of Sheldon Cooper 😯
I tought i was the only one that sometimes gets uncomfortable speaking without chewing gum😂😂
polar ice is the best idc
So basically David is living proof that no matter how wealthy or famous you are, single men never grow out of the 3 in 1 soap 😂
so this was just a promotion for his perfume huh
Everytime he advertises how many PLASTIC bottles he uses, it kills me. Come on David, be an exemple!
"What is in that guys mouth, I wanna go talk to him said " Said no one ever
I’m so surprised he didn’t put chipotle as one of the things, I love you David!!!
They should do mr beast next

Suave kids shampoo is now sold out in stores
I hate cinnamon gum too!! I have an 80 buck pillow and it is EVERYTHING for a great nights sleep!!
David oversharing for 12 minutes
He so add I love it.

NOT DAVID USING 3 in 1 🤢🤢🤢
How was it being Jim in The Office?
I think I lost at least 100 if not more brain cells while he was talking about his children’s shampoo. Update : I lost an additional 500 brain cells when he said “ I love awards But think they’re pointless so I’ve been making my own awards” while filming a ‘10 things he can’t live without video’
“I have to have something between my legs” woah there David😂
10:03
Love this
I swear I thought I was so weird for sleeping on my side with a pillow between my legs until I saw this
not the 3 in 1 david 😭
I just realized David isn’t wearing his green bracelet
hiii
the suave 😂😂😭🔫😭😂
Wait he did what for juice wrld video????
Real fans know that joe made those awards, David!!!!
Literally if the garbage part of the internet puked on a guy
Thank you David for explaining the painstaking & complex process on how to use shampoo. I’ve come to the realization that I have been using it wrong
Dumb

This man is playing life like It’s a game
David is still a kid 😂
David Dobrik is literally a 4yro in a adult body
He’s such a lil cutie pie it makes me sick
I wish Natalie and David would date... but if they ever broke up... nothing would never be the same without her.. so that’s prob why they won’t date until future... hmmm
jonathan young
I love David dobrik
I wish I had a flamethrower as a stress reliever
Rappers: Money, Cars, Chains.                             David: My kids suave shampoo

Jesus is lord
It was a little pricey, $15.000 for a pillow. Just a little
The views are not what I expected
He cant live without attention that is for sure.
David you have sinned warm water g.o.t reference “ shame shame shame
i like the guy im not here with a hater mentality but why he have to do forced small laugh during every intro its so cringe
Where has he been

Do video of Drake like so they can read
It was so cute when they brought out Natalie that way 🥺🥰
If you listen to Views, David is both one of the smartest and dumbest people at the same time🤣
me: *sees the title* me: *lizza*
Other youtubers: chains and flexing David: suave shampoo

I also have a bamboo pillow and it's the most comfortable pillow I have ever used. 100/10 I recommend
I hate cinnamon gum too! So much
I just want Natalie and him to get married😭
my day is ruined knowing David's a 3 in 1 guy
Didn't Joe do them 'awards' tho?
I’ve been watching for three years

Joe better give him the biggest liar award next!
As I a 20 year old stoner with asburger's I genuinely think David has asburger's
I think we could all live without David dobrik
So now we know who goes and picks up the Pizza's for David and Natalie : [Taylor] HUDSON (as it said on the pizza box!)
https://youtu.be/tWP1Xq6uniE 😂😂 ohh ahaha
I started using the Suave Dobrik flavored items as well and love them! I was already using Sesame street Elmo bubble bath for years because it is mild, smells good and makes your skin so smooth. Using kid shampoos was best advice I ever got. His favorite candle is pretty crazy too!
I have no idea who this guy is, but he has a flamethrower...*****

“This is my Natalie” *natalie waving* 🥺
David said: this pillow is a lil pricey 15k  Me: 😳 wth is a expensive pillow then

“This is my Natalie”😭
Nobody cares about this guy only some 12 year old weebs with undeveloped brains.
Don’t be shy make a vlog
Useless piece of talentless human garbage
david does not use suave
Did anyone else not even blink twice when he said the pillow was 15,000 dollars. Like at this point I expect nothing less
No way I thought I was weird for drinking a lot of water. I dont like soda, ANY Soda and I dont like many other drinks the only other drink I drink is tea. But I drink mainly water. Like 6 to 13 water bottles a day lol and I like my water like just barely cold like in the fridge for like 5 min ot room temp
9 year olds be like:  David has not posted a YouTube video in 5 mouths becouse he’s dead
"I'm really unstoppable" the kinda mindset we all need
Soul sacrifice. Blood to the wild
Why doesn’t he make videos anymore ??
How could u not love him
David just tries to tell us that he’s straight with his 3 in 1 shampoo 🧴
Slightly warm water is actually healthier
Why is David no posting anymore
@4:47 😳 I literally stopped what I was doing!
Youtube is getting really comfortable with these double unskippable ads...
david dobrik is the richest person that i can 100% relate to
Ok
That 15,000 dollar pillow joke made me laugh more than it should have.

Jesus is coming soon! Repent and turn to God for the kingdom of heaven is near! Jesus came to this earth to remove our sins and become our perfect high priest. He was hated by the world become he is not of the world. He was whipped and killed carrying our sins and rose on the third day so that we can raise with him. Time is short repent and put your faith in Jesus.
This man not funny.

Tana could never
Notice how he didnt say vlog camera
That pillow is 99 bucks not 40

"I've just been making my own awards" Guess who's not getting employee of the month for the Vloffice this time for lying about how you got some of those awards.
I want a Natalie 😂
To the Great People Reading this, sending virtual hugs to anyone who needs it stay safe, my dream is 1k 💓
AND CHEWING GUM WITH A MASK MAKES YOUR EYES BURN
David: "in case i get a dog" Also david: *is a human puppy*
Perfume is for women DD.  Men’s scents are called cologne!  I’m not buying it until is renamed.
Why is she fatter
Would you subscribe to my channel please  TARGET 🏁 ❤️ 100 SUBSCRIBE
David really left us and stoped posting
Nickelodeon is a bunch of pedophiles
A future millionaire will like this comment
So much plastic... seriously? Use a reusable water bottle.
Air, water, food, shelter, blood, a heart, maney a kidney     I couldn't think of 10
One of the things he can't live without is his laugh track squad.
Being corny
So... he washes his body with hands? No luffa? No wash cloth? *screaming in black people*
Who else was stunned at the fake price of the pillow
Could have given Joe a shout out but claimed the Vloffie Awards as his idea. Not cool David
Lol I skipped the part whole Natalie part idk why
If David and Natalie don't end up together love is a lie
Not a 3 in 1 😭
Me: *meticulously using shampoos, hair masks, detanglers, conditioners to try and tame my hair* David in every video: Suave Kids!
for some reason even though he's a vlogger he's really nervous
Great shirts! https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=n%3A7141123011%2Cp_4%3ABTPrinting&ref=bl_sl_s_ap_web_7141123011
He owes all the other awards to joe for making them lol
How do I get in line for the model 3 lol
simple dude, I like it
David is truly 12 years old
Learn English free subscribe to the channel Engvid with Alex. https://youtu.be/r0QJuH0lmWg
I have two jokes, EVERYONE THEY ARE JOKES OKAY DON'T GET OFFENDED. I also love David very much.   (1) He uses 3-in-1 shampoo? No wonder he is balding (2) He's like "It's not that I don't brush my teeth I do" do you think he brushes with the 3-in-1 as well?
He said he's making his own awards??????? they are Vloffice awards my guy stop lying
How about Air Water or Electricity ?
ALSO JOE VULPIS MADE THOSE AWARDS!!!!
lol no btgyri i
I couldve not cared less
Someone get this man a water bottle
Sub to my channel to try and win some air pods
but david i thought it was strawberry !!!!
His orange nickleodeon flesh light
Why is this dude associated with Nickelodeon when his content isn’t for children at all??
When David starts taking his hair seriously [real shampoo, real (not Great Clips) haircuts], his life is going to get even better.
No One:  David Literally Every Interview: sUAvE nO TeAR SHamPoO

1. How dare you not give @ughitsjoe his credit for the awards 2. You are a child 3. Please have David a lot more on GQ
“I made my own awards!” No David! No you didn’t!! JOE did!!!😂😂

Ginos east is amazing I have one right by my house

David and Natalie are getting married. Just look at the way she looks at him when he talks. The chemistry is insane.
Cinnamon gum is the best gum
When David said the pillow was 15,000 my jaw dropped to the floor
He forgot to mention his mirror..

Thank you sm

Me: "Hey guys wanna see what me ride a unicycle and juggle at the same time"  Friends: "Nah we are watching something more important, 10 things David Dobrik Can't Live Without"
Imagine your school being shampoo..
Petition for Joe to take back those awards after David said he made them

His laugh is like Alex Warren
https://youtu.be/dqSTDyBT_Us
Am I the only person that has never watched a video David dobrik made? I honestly don’t know how I made it this far without watching one... none I can remember anyway. I have a habit of steering clear of things or people it seems everyone else loves. That’s probably a terrible habit now that I think if it lol  Edit: omg I’m dead, hearing him bringing out the “David’s perfume,” alright maybe I’m missing out, he seems funny. I kinda love how he makes himself laugh all the time
When david turns 30 he will literally be the embodiment of the movie “13 going on 30”.💀💀💀
Is it just me or is this guy always so lucky?!!
This was the most entertaining top 10 I've ever seen.😂
David's vlog camera:-  (~_~メ)(-_-メ)

Boy: Do you want to kiss me?  Girl: Everytime I get the chance!  Boy: Would you ever hit me?  Girl: Why are you even asking me this?! No!  Boy: Can I trust you?  Girl: Yes  Boy: Darling  Girl: gasp No..  Boy: Will you merry me?  Now read it backwards👆👆😂😁  If I made you laugh then please support me by subscribiinng me.  Really it doesn't hurt you nor your wealth or data goes but you can help others and make his life happy.plzzz🙏🙏🙏 *

I know joe big mad that david showed off the vloffie awards that joe gave him and david took credit for it💀💀
Omg that fire gun is so scary!😬😹😹
The fact that david is 24 but uses 3 in 1 children's shampoo is so funny

Who else misses him and the vlog squad? 🙋🏻‍♂️😞
Is that a charging phone case? So cool! Didn’t know there’s such thing!!😮😮
Bruh he looks like coconut head in his high school photo
Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double 15 second no skip ads .

#1 thing David Dobrik can’t live without saying the n word look it up
I know Natalie is dating Todd but I always get a "what would've been" vibe whenever David and Natalie are joking together ❤  Still love Nat and Todd together tho
I really thought the pillow was 15K HAHAHAHHAHA
he’s just different
omg i miss david so much
its a little pricy $15,000 lets be honest thats pocket change for him
Finally
11:00 11:02 lol

7:08 same, it just feels right
He was advertising the shampoo
surprised a vlog camera wasnt on this list
David I was just going to ask you if you can donate to my school for my football fundraiser
Who is this lol
David is soooo precious
6:50 15k for pillow Jeez he got me 🤣🤣
Lol! I'm Out of garbage bags, out of t.p. using paper towels, been out of laundry soap using dish soap, no milk, no eggs, no butter... there's more but these are the things  I'm currently living without. Lifestyle a little tough right now that's al lm I'm gonna say.
3 in 1 yeah you’re weird
He just looks so comfortable with her they have tony stark and pepper pots vibes
Lmao I knew Natalie would be one of them
Am I the only one that noticed that David wasn't wearing the green band on his hand? I am really concerned for that band where is it and what happened? Make a quick tick tock video about it please Davey Dave
I thought the first essential would be a vlogging camera  Not dang kid shampoo and gum

Lmfao, this man just bought a 9.5 million dollar house, owns a Ferrari, Aston Martin and a Tesla and his biggest flex is that he uses a 3 in 1 😂😂   He’s the definition of being wealthy over being rich
This the closest thing we gonna get to a vlog guys take it or leave it 😂
David and natalie is just to good to be true to be friends. Just how? I know they are not haha
am i the only one who heard him say "for a Juice Wrld music video" tf?!!
Same about the pillow between the legs it's just comfortable
This is the only episode I've seen with actually essentials
*https://youtu.be/psOOykImhYI** ♡ God Bless Dios te bendiga 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙*
Most people: “come look at my closest, everything black “  David: *brings entire closet to living room* 😂😂
when david brought out his closet of just black shirts my first thought was _natalie is going to have to put those away_ 😂
6:39 Where did you get that pillow? Wayfair?
Why is this dude famous? He should be serving me hamburgers at McDonald's
You better be recycling all dem plastic water bottles my good sir.
He forgot to mention his stash of Cocaine. One of many drugs he can’t live without...
He uses 3 in 1 !!!!! Ayooo wtf

Get your before a million pass
I love how when the toy car tipped he just braces himself and went down with the ship
David meme'd em good
Joe must have seen Meatcanyons video
he doesn’t have on the green bracelet that he’s had on since like middle school anymore 😳
David has done his rituals.
of course David's the person that uses 3in1
I’m here for the 🐐
David should look into solar power wireless phone chargers
Yo Joe made those awards
2:51 What if it's a booger?
You’re telling me that David acted like the Vloffie’s were HIS idea???
Starting to think that he copys Alex Warren and not the other say around
Bro, when he said 15,000 dollars 😂😭
Poor David that Deep Dish is the saddest deep dish I have ever seen.
He almost had me. With that $50,000 on a pillow
He should start a vlog
1:50 I stopped my job because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Missing Vlog Aquads vid
David is def stoned here
this was a show and tell...
YouTube please stop getting comfortable with these double unskippable ads.
Joe watching David taking credit for his awards: 👁💧👄💧👁
0:27 my entire life changed with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
This kid seems funny he should be a vlogger
he can certainly live without uploading
Today we learned David doesn’t wash his legs and just lets the water run down his body n thinks that’s ok lol
dawg! that charger method is now getting stolen. thank you david dobrik. let me win the tesla :(
He has a very punchable face and could easily live without
Natalie is under the table
Do I care?
I don't think that a human being is a thinggggggggggggggggggggggggg      *OR IS IT VSAUCE INTRO PLAYS*
“I just like the color green. It just catches your eye” welp guess I’m only wearing green for the rest of my life until I accidentally run into David Dobrik
Am I the only one who thinks this charging system is genius?!
I can’t wait to see Joe mentioning this lol
https://youtu.be/HyKV_P23o4g
david is a 24 year old kid..................he gets me
David is such a kid I love it
Bruh I also have to have something between my legs when I sleep
Are we just not gonna acknowledge the gum trick this man just did.

https://share.cshcrates.co/AVeryLuckyPerson777
When you already know this stuff about David but you still watched the whole video😂♥️
when are you fixing your app?
Wait. Is he joking about the david disposable app or not ? I'm confused
I miss his vlogs 😢😔☹️
David has a charging case on his list but not an actual phone
Room temperature water gang 💧💪
How has suave kids not sponsored him
Sounding like Violet Beauregarde with all that gum talk.
Bruh my eyes peeled when he said 15k for the pillow but i believed it the way he said it so seriously.
We really aren’t gonna talk about the fact that he uses 3in1 shampoo???

Hey everyone, I started a gofundme for my 14 year old doggos eye procedure, I'd appreciate if you could share or donate!  https://gf.me/u/y24chw
Let's goo 🙌
Every video I watch of David being interviewed I’m slowly less and less convinced he’s mentally stable. Claiming he enjoyed room temperature water was the last straw for me lol
the fact that David calls himself a “20 year old kid”
I drink more water than you🙄 & Bring back the blogs😭🥺
Tf asked
Juice Wrld music video?!
Make more videos man
8:18, do you know why it has a kaleidoscope, well if you search Nickelodeon Movies Intro (2004), the intro sort of looks like a kaleidoscope which I think is really cool. Some of you will find the intro very nostalgic.
Lmaooooo this man is such a dork
It's not David Dobrik without having to flex with the nickelodeon kids choice award in the thumbnail.
(just kidding)  david: my bamboo pillow is 1500  me:eh not sureprised
What David doesn’t love: the environment    Jk (not really) love you David but get a 35mm film compact camera you can continue to put film in and get a reusable bottle x

Poor joe david took all the credit for his vloffice awards :')
Gum is essential 😅

Joe made those awards!!!!!
Good luck getting that film developed
GQ has made more videos this month than David him self
This you could hear David’s Chicago accent more than ever
i’d like to see david’s closet with all his black clothes edit: he showed us
You should switch to re-usbale water bottles!!! that much plastic a day is not good for the earth. Like if you agree!
When is this coming back he made me laugh so much
He can’t live without Natalie
You might not watch him but we can all agree his just a funny great dude
Haven’t even watched it yet but for some *odd* reason I feel like Natalie is gonna be on this list
god i love that man
David explaining the Sauve kids shampoois just something else
I was gonna buy the pillow until I heard 15,000 DOLLEERRRZZZ
Noooo David 😭 not a 3 in 1
“Omg what’s in his mouth, I wanna talk to him”😂😂😂
YO DOBRIK PWS UPLOAD ON MAIN CHANNEL, MISS YOU HOMIE
LIES DAVID!!! JOE MADE THOSE FOR YOU!! Smh lol give him a shout out! He deserves it! Lmao
He’s like a 1st grader showing us his pencil collection.

Jokes on you David, I dont have friends 😎
Me : gets bullied for using baby soap    This guy ( uses baby soap ) : hailed for being soo bold .  Me : I see . You are the one .
yo can someone link me the pillow ???
When he showed the pillow and said it was 15k I was like what! I thought I saw that or something similar at Costco last weekend!

Another David Dobrik interview with a gum trick
Have you ever wondered who you are what you're purpose in life is?  Do you wonder why 2020 has been so messed up? A lot of churches teach wrong and just want your money.

Hml on ig lets be friends ;) @juan.vargasj

Not david using 3 in 1.......
The internet. Literally.
The fact that David is 24 and uses 3 in 1 children’s shampoo is so funny
“ omg what’s in that guys mouth I wanna talk to him”
Who even is this guy? Why does YouTube promote him so much? I’m tired of these forced celebs
He really did Joe dirty with the awards
But he do this
he seem know more about samphoo than i know about my mom
YouTube Comments: When the world needed him most he came back Me, an intellectual: Well yes, but actually no....
Married and divorced within a year.  I can see why.
At this point, I’m surprised David isn’t sponsored by Suave
7:05 I do this to but cuz I’m lonely 😔 pain

i thought he was gonna say chipotle💀
this is so wholesome   i love it💞

Me entering David’s closet: ✊
His gum trick 🤯
There is NO WAY  that david only showed us 10 things    must be because of how well he sells them!

This man David really has a 3 in 1 kid’s shampoo, conditioner, and body wash with perfect skin.
Meanwhile girls have 6 different soaps
45$ for a pillow is a fordable! 👁👄👁 Am I poor or what?
Anyone have a free pig because i don got my natalie
This video feels like a huge ad
We miss you David!! Come back to youtube!! We need your funny vids during these crappy times.
What a loser
These are definitely the lamest essentials I’ve seen on CQ, and I’ve seen most of them. You’re cute though lol
If you are reading this comment:  💕BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000💕❤️💞💞💫✨💫💞💫✨💫💞💫✨💫💞💫

Yo I don’t even wanna hear anything related to David till mans pick ups a camera
0:56 I quit my 9-5 with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Notice how his camera isn’t in it
cinnamon gum is the best gum flavor, what r u talking abt?!!
His laugh reminds me of James Charles
Oh... this video is around 3 vlogs long. :)
Celebrity crush till the end. 👏🏽❤️
Closest thing we had to a vlog in months
Didnt mention how Ugh its Joe got you those awards. Poor Joe
I miss his vlogs so much

The shampoo he uses man. No wonder he’s got that hairline
floatplanes autocephalies
I can live without this video.
10:03 for sum reason I dyed when he said that🤣
This guy is a straight child
Alle erwarten den Reaktionsboss
No one: David Dobrik: this is my not a flame thrower, it has gotten me through a lot. Me: what do you need a flame thrower for?
Wow, David just said the awards joe got him he got himself 😭😭😭. Wait to he hears about this ...
Agree on the cinnamon gum
I can only think of that meatcanyon cartoon.
Wow didnt even mention Seatgeek 😂
8:42 making your own trophies? Didn't give Joe any credit 😭
Who is this again?
Top 10 Space Movies Judged By Actual Astronauts https://youtu.be/iZPVLXkowA8
David  : I think it’s 15,000k   Me: not fazed
This is latest video David Dobrik has released since his last video that came out like half a year ago
Anyone else feel like he's doing lines?
a heart, a brain, a liver, a skeleton, blood, veins, nerves, water, oxygen, food  done. No need to waste 12 mins of your life.
Finally get to see him
I was wondering when this was coming out
poor joe :(
Androids be like: pathetic
I really dont like this guy
This isn't a David Dobrik vlog but I am going to pretend it is.  We miss you David.
Nooooooo where Taylor
You forgot kissing little girls
No one :  David dobrik: I'm literally a fish
loml
*David is the sweetest most relatable guy ever!* 😭❤️❤️
I’m surprised that David hasn’t burnt his house yet
why did I watch this I don't even know who that is
david a man-child lowkey😂
I've watched David for few years now. He really can't talk normal in any interview or anything. He's constantly laughing. I refuse to think that someone can be that happy in this world.
The closest thing we have to a David vlog
This man right there, i miss his vlog
How about he makes another vlog instead of dumbass tik toks
I love him 😩😭💖
6:55 I can relate
So whose gonna tell him that he gotta stop that 3 and 1👀
10 things people don’t care about
You already know that David can’t leave his childhood behind when he brings kids shampoo to the recording
https://youtu.be/gsLe8VHUw7I Check This Out Now!!!

IS THIS A NEW HOUSE?! Also YAY NATALIEEE
Broo tf is that pizza. Man as an Italian my eyes are bleeding...
Sure natalie is a top essential
I’m glad he was joking 😂😂
My eyes when he said $15,000...🤯 👀
6:35 "its a little pricey, it was $15,000"
How did this man get a kids choice awards when his content is not for kids
I like how he thinks he loves water more than me I drink a gallon a day 😈
Alternate title: 10 sponsors David Dobrik Can't Live Without
Oh how i miss the vlogs
I’m genuinely in love with him
This dude literally give no fucks
He has such a unique taste! 😂
i really thought bro dropped 15 bands on a pillow
This is like watching a kindergartener that just won the lottery show off all his favorite stuff. Love it
Thanks for NOT making him wear a mask during this
IS DAVID HIGHHHH
Can't wait for people to get triggered about David using plastic water bottles!!!!
Weirdo
8:55 I’m triggered how they aren’t dating, what kind of friend steals your girl like that⁉️
1: using his friends humility for comedy and content
Joe: “Am I a joke to you?!”
my god this dude is annoying
David looks so good, it seems quarantine is doing him good ! Also he looks alittle  skinner .
the pillow is 99$ 😂
I think the reason so many girls love David is the same reason so many guys love the boomer girl its the childish and pure demeanor he gives off people want to have fun be kinda childish cause why should it matter and david is just really good at giving off that whimsical tone that doesn't make him see fully mature but not literally a child either i believe the only reason he's been able to keep such and imagine is because, as far as I know, he has had any hidden issues to discuss or share with the people it makes everything think, he's sweet, and he has to be cause he's never not been, i mean now i feel like the constant laughing is kinda annoying and the jokes of self awareness are way over done but ig it really just means thats still him and really is him so yeah im not sure if you're even allowed to dislike the guy, only think you can say is you don't like the jokes which is fine and you'll move on while he gives more people teslas
10 things david cant live without: Water I love you dave and your vlogs but my god... water, really, just add oxygen why dont you
Bro he’s so corny wtf
Joe watching this 👁👄👁

I thought i was the only person who slept with a pillow between their legs😂😂😂

I hate the fact that he says that he made those awards when we all know that joe who made them that’s selfish 😌

Hey bro . You might not want to drink bottled water it’s 2020... and you’re entire fam base is Gen Z they’ll cancel you #savetheturtles
why is David the male version of me? I LOVE black, gum and pizza are also an essential for me!!!!
Not at me watching the video while charging my phone 😂😂
“These awards are actually heavy, i can fight a robber with this”. He literally has a paintballgun and a flamethrower but chooses to fight with his awards...
He is a kid at heart
he's so geeky it's wholesome
David’s looking slim, good for him
*When Natalie sat on David’s lap 😳.*
David talking about how sleep is important, yet he stays up all night playing warzone
I don’t get the appeal. Is it the white mediocrity?
C'mon david if you like water so much get just water its better for the environment
too much gum is a laxatives lmao
my face when he said the pillow was $15k: 👁👄👁
David using a 3 in 1 kids Suave only convinces me more that men know nothing about body care LOL
I cringed even thinking about him drinking warm water... yuckkk lol
GQ: Pick 10 things you can’t live without   David: Ok here’s 13 things

David nobrick
When you realize he is a 12 year old millionaire lol
i also need pillow in between my legs........when i go to sleep
1:59 what type of video is this?
David Dobrik would actually probably own a $15k pillow if he could find one for that price.
*If you’re here you miss David’s vlogs 😭😭.*
Jason's version was better
Did he just say for a juice wrld music video?

Why am I watching this at 1:46 am? Why is this even recommended to me? I don't even know this guy.
David: Hope you're ready for this one.  Me(watchin the gum trick for te 19840778268 time): Yes. Yes, I am.
Anyone pause the video and google David’s pillow?
Tell me why he said he made joes trophies
I like water too! It’s easier to drink room temperature/hot water than cold water.
Shout out bamboo pillows
When he said :the pillow is $15000 I was like I’m out😂
Wow 😂.He can’t live without his perfume that’s not even out yet
This feels like a troll gq video
Love the way he advertised his perfumes 😂
David Dobrik somehow hasn’t heard of wireless chargers.

Hit up Drake, The Weeknd lets go GQ
Tesla: 0-60 In 4 seconds  David: UNO REVERSE
David said he was slowly losing hair but then decides to use a 3-1 kids shampoo LOL
Who?
AYO
If a non David fan watching this he would think he's a child😂
Love Natalie 💕 the secret weapon behind David Dobrik LLC
the closest we’ll get to watching him rn
Once you go black you never go back 😂😂🖤
I can't believe David said he made the awards himself. Poor Joe!!!
When he said the pillow cost him 15,000$ my went😱😱
He's such a baby lmaoo how cute😭
Nobody :  David : I'm literally a fish 😂
Water bottle seriously , you are such a dumbfuck
Make David more comfortable people!!! He looks so nervous here, we never see this on his videos or podcasts but the people behind the scenes on GQ are so inhuman that it makes him clearly and understandably nervous
his face when Natalie hugged him
That’s so me. David did you steal my life 😂 jk
what a nerd
Couldn’t even give joe credit for the vloffies
👆🌏Literally 99% won't see this but if you do, God truly bless you, stay safe, maskup and have a wonderful day... My dream is to become YOUTUBE Famous 🥺
He basically said he doesn’t wash his legs 😅
check the impures instead
He’s literally a kid with million of  dollars 😂😂
David is like giving a 12 year old million dollars to spend.......
charlie brown vibes with the clothing lol
David return?
Ohhh no not the 3 in 1 shampoo 😂😑
this is Joe erasure
david dobrik doesn’t wash his toes
Poor joe. David said he started making his own awards. Joe made those awards for you. Rip joe 🤣
I’m on the same level with David when it comes to water! Room temp, or warmer 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ Room temp water is better for you if you’re dehydrated...just a little fun fact.
Hahahahah at 10:13 he sounds like a baby
"I love waters"    vlog squad's been counting water lately for David
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR ONE OF THESE
so he can do interviews but can’t film vlogs anymore?
Joe, David took credit for the awards!!
I wonder if he was @ his new house? That fireplace n couch look different also the wall color is little lite & different n I could see the reflection.
Someone get this kid a Brita Filter and a reusable water bottle stat
When he joked about his pillow being 15,000$: 👀
"I look like a 20 year old kid..." DAVID YOU'RE NOT A KID!😂
6:40 When he said the pillow was for $15,000 I was shocked but also kind of believed him because he is David Dobrik!! He's rich and does crazy stuff!!
Can someone explain to me why Californians insist on drinking bottled water?? I genuinely don’t understand. Our planet is dying is it so difficult to purchase a water filter?
“Hit the gym or start wearing black”😭😂
"Woah what is in that guy's mouth, I want to take to him." LMFAOO
Awesome
Wait he sells perfume???? Cool
i was watching this video on my other monitor while figuring out my live stream settings for a game, then i heard him say $15K dollar pillow and i just went wide eyed and turned to look at what kind of pillow it is then he said jk LMAO
"it;s like 35 dollars"... It's a 100 dollar pillow, David
*** ALERT **** DAVID DOBRIK CONTENT *** TUNE IN ***
Thank you GQ, this has been the the closest I’ll get to a vlog.
wait a minute... he lives in LA but made someone flew to chicago just because of a dish pizza. Wowww

things david CAN live without: making vlogs😭
Stole Joe's credit for the weird awards
Who else misses david dobrik's vlogs
What is the pillow called
Davids cool and all, but why is he drinking plastic water bottles bruh
Not goin lie U had me on the pillow issue
This guy looks like he worked his way through success not like adiroon dae***  untalented
Natalie is like a freeloader who loves eating and takes ur money and chases ur clout. Taylor is better than Natalie and she does not date one of ur best friend ( never date ur bro’s ex )
He’s like a four year old with a million dollars
Room temp water is the best
"nothing" "non-stop fun" WHEN THEY HAVE TWOOO DIFFERENT ANSWERS AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
April fools be comin way too early for this
I feel like I deserve a Tesla for being here before 1 million
He sounds like Alex warren !!!!
"What is in that guys mouth? I wanna talk to him"
Noooo why do you use plastic bottles! Get an investment like a aquasana!!
Where is the green band!!!
I thought this was a old vid I am like I think I watched this vid I’ll watch it again it was posted one hour ago 🤪
David: it didn't taste like green apple Also David: that was a serious letdown
why is he attractive to me now....
didn't he win a surfboard? why didn't that go into his award collection?
Got Time For This And Not Vlogs Im Sad Now
I do the same thing every day about the pillows and one  time I couldn't find  my pillow and I cried
Room temperature water yes!!!!!!
“This is my Natalie” lmao😂😂😂
David dobrik is the most organized person i know
Danny Duncan Next !
Let's just hope David didn't step into dog poo before filming this
Ugh it’s Joe deserves more!!!
This David guy seems really cool, he should start a YouTube channel
REGISTER 2 VOTEEEE
Omg when the car fell off the table 🤣🤣🤣
So he doesn't post for 5 months now hes on gq I'm confused
Use this as a "cinnamon  gum is trash" button
David Dobrik, since you drink a lot of water (like me) you should buy a Brita or PUR filter for you sink so you can fill up water bottles and go about your day. It’s cheaper, convenient, and better for the environment. I would definitely suggest you do that because the filters take out all most all fine particles in the tap water.
He's just too down to earth and sweet and humble but he's a celebrity too so that is why it feels weird, he's too cute.
Nice job giving credit to Joe for those awards rip
toad watching like 😡
I think I enjoyed this too much
I expected a shoutout to Joe for the awards, “I have been making my own awards” no you you haven’t David lol
When they brought in Natalie. Aww❤️😂
Are vlogs even coming back at this point ?
Can we have a Asap Rocky as well as Dave& AJ Tracey
So he can do a GQ interview before uploading a vlog .....
My phone hasnt died... Nah actually it died yesterday LMFAO
honestly, he is such a genuine person
David why do you look like coconut head off of Ned declassified @ 9:17.....
$PON$OR$$$$

Natalie was your date to prom, therefor you dated back in high school

I didn’t even know that tesla gave you a mini power wheel Tesla for referring people lmao
Where is the green bracelet David
David if I was stuck at sea an I had 3 fully charged cause that would last me way longer than 17 hours
So confused why he doesn’t just have a reusable water bottle what a waste of plastic

David uses a 3 in 1 smh ...
WOW DAVID IS SO FAKE AND DIDN’T GIVE JOE CREDIT FOR THE AWARDS
"Who the fook is that guy"?!
David is just like a 10-year-old stuck in a 24-year-old's body
“Believe it or not, I used baby shampoo as a baby”
Nice sir
Spoiled beyond
Cinnamon gum is like bacon flavored dum dums
He sounds Robert Pattinson level insane in this one
Imagine this has more replys than david dobriks comment
can't believe joe didn't get credit for those awards smh
I can literally picture Taylor getting annoyed when David throws and plays with his black tees.😂
Hi gamers
He did mention his vlogging camera
I think we all know that couch isn't where it's supposed to be
We dog 3-1 shampoos 'round here boya
I thought David was normal until he said he prefers warm water...
Lol me And David both have to have something in between our legs to sleep (pause) I really don’t like my knees touching each other cause I’m kinda boney so it feels weird
With his 3n1 shampoo I feel like he is part of the group of men that don’t wash their asses....
Some David Cologne would be nice🥺
To say you made up those trophys suck cause my man Joe gave you those. Still love you though just saying lol
Literally the cutest thing ever😭😭😍😍
I stg this all just free promtion dor all the stuff he uses
*Is this whole video sponsored?*

Who would suspect this adorable kid puts snakes on his friends
i love him
Kinda hurt that he didn’t give joe the credit for the awards made up!!! 😐
Love that he is so humble and uses sauve kids. Maybe that is why he has a receding hair line.
That’s so weird I thought I was the only one who had to sleep with sum between my legs
David : It's my Natalie Me: Don't give up hope
So basically David Dobrik gives zero fucks about the environment...

David seems so happy and genuinely himself in this video. Makes my heart smile!
4:54 “This is perfect for like when you’re roasting smores.”  *switches to bigger flames*  “And this is for if you hate your neighbors.”

So the perfume will smell like the Suave shampoo,right?
It’s when he falls in the Tesla for me

kid is  ga
If someone doesn't know who david is or what he does for a living or watch his vlogs and just watches this video and is introduced to him through just this video they are gonna think that he is a psychopath.
Who else noticed the person in the fireplace reflection?
I think David should know we cant live without his vlogs too😂😂😂the tiktoks arent enough
I know David didn’t just take credit for Joe’s Vloffice awards
y'all know where can i get a "Natalie"?

Anyone else who just watched one david dobrik video and got addicted and now loves the vlog squad
he reminds me sm of mr peanut butter omg
I litterally just commented on David's recent post and just guesses that he used watermelon suave kids now I'm watching this and it litterally one of his essential lol 🤣
Literally just sat here and said to myself aloud "why did I watch this".
When he said that his assistant ties his shoelaces in another video, I stopped taking this man seriously.

Man I miss the vlogs but it’s nice to see David growing as a person and becoming more and more successful
"This is my Natalie" I guess he meant "assistant"  (Edit: did David read this comment cuz he said "my Natalie" in his story)
