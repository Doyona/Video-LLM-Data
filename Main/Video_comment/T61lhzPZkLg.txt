GMOs... just GMOs for the seedless friggin fruits And also imagine trying to buy a watermelon so you also have a seed and just have no seeds in it... thats not a win for me
These are mutations from human manipulation (artificial selection) + genetic engineering.      • The strawberry is hydroponically grown (giving them proportionately more water in their tissues, diluting the flavor),      • Seedless watermelons have a gene (controling an enzyme which is used in sexual maturation) which has been turned off - meaning no seeds (or those partially developed yellow things).      • Avocados have been farmed by multiple cultures, for something like 3,000 years - meaning very different from the wild root stock, even before we started genetically engineering them for supermarket shelves.  [ btw - The Aztec word for Avocado is *_Āhuacatl_* - meaning scrotum, or testicle. ]
