You have to Love the “?” In the title.  That said, there is plenty of AG.  I just got another delivery yesterday.
Illuminati and Freemason is completely finished
selling silver, hell no..trading for properties, food, cars..maybe
If you invested in paper silver/"unallocated" or "pooled", you don't really own anything. Transition it to physical.
Silver is a bad investment.  All the hype is deceiving people.
S’ funny one of my buddies just had a ounce bar delivered today ... think this David is full of shite .. keep hold of it all people they don’t want us to have any of it!!
Liars all !   How can there be no silver available?  All the dealers have to do is raise the price.  You are all full of shit and as guilty as the manipulation
They can't find silver to buy so they are trying to scare people into selling theirs. This is all fake and propaganda. Hold your silver
Elon could buy First Majestic Silver?
First Majestic Silver heavily shorted?
Tesla secretly buying silver? Reason for shortage? Talk about gold a distraction? Tesla needs how much silver per year?
Im bullish on knob...
Excellent
Still plenty of paper silver load up people
The Perth mint is currently out of 1kg silver bars, 10 oz bars  1kg silver coins as of 15th February 2021
Keep buying holding stacking only PHYSICAL !!!!!! take delivery if you get into fake ass SLV.
Silver news numismatic coins may not be available but bullion silver and junk silver is available everywhere, of course you'll pay a premium, but it's available. All you have to do is call kitco or apmex or any other major precious metal suppliers
BUY PHYSICAL METAL.
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
I'm going balls deep into silver!!!
Banks crush metal prices to save their funny money. You can't beat the banks. IT'S A TRAP!  Buy a lottery ticket instead.
I just bought 11 ounces .
Depends on where you are. Our local shops act like they don't want it, and if they do, they will only offer way below spot price. I recommend folks try selling some of your silver to see just how difficult is to unload it when you need to.
Amazing

Nice to see this conversation
Shii haii..
🙏🙏🙏🙏
The title is untrue.  Premium are just raised for small quantities, and deliveries are restricted.  The thing people have to be aware of is that if they attempt to buy silver, they are going up against governments, not hedge funds.  Laws will be broken, contracts will be voided, you will simply be denied your ability to collect what you bought and no court in the country will uphold your rights.  Meanwhile the premiums will just go up, to whatever they need to go to.  You can't do a run through the bullion banks, they'll simply restrict supply and lie to you.

no matter how much physical is bought JP morgan can print and short paper silver to negative infinity...
Yes, they're all conspiring against you to make precious metals more affordable.
.... I have to ask the question: why, if there is no physical available, is the spot price falling? I have been around commodities for more than 30 years, and I don't recall a shortage of physical ANYTHING resulting in lower prices.  Somebody is lying, and it is not the chart.
Davis is an excellent listener and that makes him such a good interviewer. He makes it a conversation by adapting his questions to what the guest actually says and always let’s them speak. Some levity here and there too! I’m always impressed by this
i got some silver coins i’ll sell a piece for 100k
They don't need to ask David Morgan jack! Silver is going to get jacked straight to the moon!🌙
Adjusted for inflation (depending on who you believe) the $50 peak in 1980 is $157 today.
I've been trading silver for 20 years and my highest expectation has been for silver to hit $140 or even as high as $200.  That being said, if silver could go up to $300 or $400 I would say that no market deserves it more than silver. And, I'm not selling until David Morgan calls the top.
This is fake news. These people have no credibility. Wall Street Bets DID NOT post about pumping silver or silver ETFs.   FAKE NEWS
I've not seen any chatter on reddit about silver.
I will continue to buy silver and will probably buy some more today. Just a few ounces, 5-10, each month. I am looking at increasing my net worth overall. Silver certificates will end up being well placed at the bottom of bird cages which I believe they are worth. IF YOU CAN'T LITERALLY HOLD THE SILVER IN YOUR HAND YOU DO NOT OWN IT!  So many people want to rush for the instant and quick way to get rich. As in the story I used to read to my children the turtle's slower and determined pace will get me to my goal.
R/wallstreetsilver
Went to Buy Silver yesterday here in Ireland all out of stock guess I missed the boat on this one :(
I'll hold many years if I have too. ;)
Don’t be stupid and buy slv stock, if you buy silver then get physical silver.
Hay kitco /...Can I buy some .. INVISIBILE SILVER?.....hahaha😂🤣😅
Kitco...I have silver for sale today pay now.. Buyer..ok heres the$$ ca$h for 200oz Kitco....oh come back in 3/4weeks? Buyer...So you don't physically have🤔 Buyer ..can I do cub side pick up.. Kitco..No we don't..on the spot... have for you need 3/4 weeks..?? 🙉🤫🙊🤔🙈🤫
david puts his finger on  it-silver market is way way way too complex for most people to play in it. Buy as much physical as you can digest and secure of course, but for most this is no country for old or young men.
Hahah maybe the boomers are buying up silver. It cant be squeezed. Its a trap set by whales. Reddit doesnt gaf about slv
The US DEBT CLOCK has 34k gold & 4700 silver ,  Trumpsara coming
INKW @ .10 going to NASDQ soon $$$$$ 🚀  🚀 🚀 🚀
Stay strong and buy silver!!!!
No need to run a squeeze, the coming deliberate financial collapse will take care of the true value of silver.  Metal is a long term strategy.
I this it was paper silver that moved into SLV 🤔
No reasonable person would buy in comex to help the hedge funds.People are buying physical.Those who buy contracts will never see their bullion
Keep taking physical silver from the market and soon the industrial users will take notice of shortage and start panic stockpiling silver as they can’t afford not to have silver for their production. Go Big or Go Home!  Silverbugs and the #silversqueeze movement is buying silver and not the t/wallstreetbets. David should do some homework.
Paper silver is fake i think.
WSB is too small to move silver. This was a move by Citadel to raise capital. They had call options on record for $SLV and needed to raise capital from loses we caused. They were simultaneously causing a distraction as a byproduct and a huge media campaign
Silver used to be $50 in 1980, the amount of inflation since then is incredible, to still have silver about half of 1980 high is proof of price manipulation for 40 years. If silver can be rigged that long, a lifetime to many, then what is the point of this exercise this week? You're more likely to win the lottery than to see silver go up to it's natural price of maybe $1,000 and on par with the other precious metals.
There's plenty of silver to be had. The problem os most people still couldn't care less about silver. Until they do silver shortage is just a pipe dream told by silver sellers
I Literally bought silver 3 days ago.
It is now a proven fact that the laws of supply and demand do not apply when it comes to the spot price of gold and silver.  Get back to me when and if the FED loses total control of the dollar.  At that point paper bullion owners will start requiring delivery for contracts rather than federal reserve notes.  Perhaps that will smash the COMEX into a million pieces and we will have a shot at true price discovery in precious metals.
You can see him reading off a script lol
Why would anyone buy paper silver instead of physical silver? They stupid or what?
Silver, gold, buy, buy, buy, "when is blood on the street buy gold, silver and/or land" bitcoin is a imaginary fantasy.
"This group got hurt in 2008, so they are mad now".  MILLIONS of people lost their homes, lives in 2008 and nobody had to answer for the illegal actions that were played out in front of America.  And there wasn't suppression David, they were breaking actual laws, except the laws were bent for the elitists.  This show sure shows a lot of hypocritical thinkers and guests.  BTW it isn't a free market by the obvious manipulation played out in real time this past week.   Inflation is only part of the problem, the other is devaluation based off of the stock market, which is being manipulated in order to further increase profits, and further creating this belief institutions have implanted into Americans that we NEED them, to protect our well being and our way of life.   I have not seen a single person who makes less than 100k/year on ANY of these shows defending the institutions or hedgefunds.  Why is that?  There is a whopping 70-80% of Americans that make less than 100K/year.  Why is the sentiment of the majority of the population not being considered?
BS. Theres plenty of silver
The US is printing money into OBLIVION... !!! BUY  PHYSICAL SILVER BUY .. BITCOIN!
Fake news. Don't believe it. Those crooks on wall street are so desperate they're lying to sell their silver to cover their loses.  Can look on WSB for yourself.
Wall street bets is not endorsing silver. STFU kitco you fraud
good interview.  thx.
Gold/Silver Ratio is somewhere between 10 to 1 -  8 to 1 Gold is currently priced at $1835 USD, Silver is currently priced at $26.50 USD Based off the Gold/Silver ratio, Silver is SEVERELY undervalued Its really worth $265 to $212
Silver's resistance at ATH will be a struggle to break through.
BULLSHIT!
SOS sit on silver if you want higher prices.
Plenty available now.
😂😂😂 since President Biden took over metal prices have jumped across the board . Sorry your doomsday didn’t happen 😊
I bought silver this am
Someone had a bunch of silver they cant sell 😂😂😂
DONT BUY SILVER. ITS FAKE NEWS.
NO ONE CARES ABOUT SILVER! FUCK SILVER AND YOUR BULLSHIT NARRATIVE! Silver to the fucking ground📉📉📉
fake news
Nobody’s buying silver. This is weak bait.
People are not able to buy silver at a premium price as well. And The paper silver price is crashing by 10%. What more proof do we need? It's all rigged. My blood is boiling right now.
THE GREAT RESET!!!
Jesus Christ is coming soon brothers and sisters repent and accept him as your Lord and Savior great tribulation is coming upon the world dont love the world or the things in it  for it will perish away but look unto God for eternal salvation of your soul through Jesus Christ I plead with you with love for time is short!!
What a joke, again this week, same as the last previous weeks. Big pump, big dump the next day. Outrageous Manipulation!
Jimmy kimmel said it’s because of the Russians!!!
FUCK SLV
Holding
Dont buy silver
This was a Wall Street failed pump to make people believe Reddit and GME were pumping it. Today it’s over, doesn’t mean silver won’t be 32$ by the end of the year
Got tons of silver.
What a joke. Silver will always have its place but it is not in WSB forum. This is all just a misdirect by the hedge funds. Take some time and join the WSB subreddit. You will find a couple million apes  that want nothing to do with commodities and only want to see GME and AMC to the moon. There isn't a single person in the group that has suggested anything about buying silver or silver stock for that matter. GME and AMC to the moon 💎 👐
Why are they embarrassing them self?
Is it right that there is 5x more Gold on the Earths surface than Silver?👉😉
What are people gonna buy if gold/silver too expensive and what will happen with the green new deal?
Question is what that 1000$ will buy you if that revaluation happens.
No one on WSB is doing this ,  we’re holding ... fuck off with this BS
Silver is dropping because some people are having to sell to cover calls.
"Silver is like the proton torpedo in the ventilation shaft of the Death Star."  Tory Watson, CEO of LANDIO (and my big brother)
What a pathetic attempt lmfao we are holding gme have your pathetic silver
A lie. Silver is a hoax at this  point in time
Liars be lying. Wsb said nothing bout silver
My mom said I can do whatever I put my mind to
Silver buy call is not even true
Shame on you for perpetuating the fake news silver narrative. WSB doesn’t care about silver nor would they speculate on it. Stop playing dumb and duping others into this false narrative.
These are LIES people don't believe it  nobody in wallstreetbets is promoting buying silver  HOLD GME
The meek shall inherit the earth.  This is how.
This is so fabricated lol go to wall street bets on reddit to find out why you should not buy silver
Ah propaganda

Don’t buy Silver, buy GME!!! This is them trying to take the attention away from it. Buy GME!
This is fake news...   This is Wall Street trying to pump silver in order to reduce the buying pressure on GameStop.  I love bullion however do not buy this silver market.
He sounds like phil jackson
Silver. You know you want it.
You're gonna get dumped on.
Wallstreetbets are not doing this. It's Wallstreet hedgefunds have the most investment into it.
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”

Citadel is long on silver. Enuff said.
I know you guys are trying very hard, but just a piece of advice This generation is not easily manipulated like previous once’s, just hold boys (GEM) to the moon. don’t fall for their bussss not one is buying.
Over 10 years ago Morgan told stackers to buy silver at $30 an ounce during the last spike...then he told them not to miss out and buy at $35...and before it was over he was urging stackers to not miss out and go for it at $45 an ounce...What is the result today...many stackers after a decade own there silver at a loss...DO NOT TRUST FALSE PROPHETS...
David sounds like a third rate used car salesman.
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
WSB is not pushing Silver, that's fake news
Y'all do realize that there are plenty of other hedge funds who are/were betting long on GME/AMC right?  Yea citadel has a big short pos in GME, and they own SLV but that doesn't mean there aren't hedge funds positioned on the other side of the trade.  If you really want to screw over the hedge funds, don't ever buy stocks again.  Then they can't take advantage of the little guy.  If you want to screw over banks, you could buy futures contracts and take delivery of the physical.  Or you could just continue blindly following whatever WSB tells you to...
Amazing content. Kudos
There is no silver bullion there is not gold bullion it’s just a iou for both. It’s not WSB you don’t understand the WSB some boomer posted about silver on WSB and the genuine idiots on there jumped on it.

Exchange markets are the biggest casino of all time.
Citadel was bleeding from GME but holds SLV. It is my theory that Citadel is behind the recent silver hype. r/wallstreetbets is NOT backing silver or SLV.
Well this seems to be a total poppycock

Kitco shows online vault purchasing is currently on temporary hold!! Reminding me of robinhood right now. 🤔 Luckily I got my purchase in this morning
Forbes magazine published an article titled, “China Killing Prisoners To Harvest Organs For Transplant: BMC Report Accuses China Of ‘Falsifying’ Data” by Zak Doffman, on November 16, 2019. The article states that China's claim of using a voluntary donation system for its billion-dollar organ transplant industry had been refuted by a report published in BMC Medical Ethics. Researchers found that the Chinese government falsified and manipulated official organ transplant datasets.  The article states, “In June, I reported on the China Tribunal in London, which found evidence of 'forced organ harvesting' from Chinese prisoners, including Falun Gong and Uighur Muslims. The Tribunal’s final judgment concluded that this 'forced organ harvesting has been committed for years...on a significant scale.' China has said that the practice has been outlawed, replaced with a system of voluntary donations. But a new report, published on November 14 in the BMC Medical Ethics journal, has refuted this, alleging that those claims of reform are being supported by the 'systematic falsification and manipulation of official organ transplant datasets in China.  “The China Tribunal used first-hand testimony from former detainees and implausible transplant availability and short waiting times to shape its findings. The witness reports were horrific—including organ extractions on live victims, subsequently killed by the procedures. A 2015 documentary claimed China’s illegal organ transplant industry is worth $1 billion each year—but China insists that forced extractions have stopped, that its efforts to reform date back to 2010, with a system of voluntary donations replacing forced organ harvesting from prisoners.  “Not so, says the BMC article, claiming that China is 'artificially manufacturing organ transplant donation data.' The report says its findings mean that any trust in China’s organ harvesting system 'has been violated,' that the reforms were 'a mask for the continued use of non-voluntary donors or donors who are coerced into giving organs.' In short, the allegation is that the new system of voluntary donations operates alongside and not instead of forced extractions. The giveaway, according to the report, is patterns in the state’s data which are too neat to be genuine—they must be falsified.  “Sources behind the forensic data analysis deployed by the report’s authors included the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS) and the Red Cross Society of China. Data found mathematical patterns that defy expected statistical anomalies. In others words, the official China reports emanate from a PR spreadsheet and not from any kind of genuine on the ground analysis and genuine data.  “Susie Hughes from the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC), which initiated the China Tribunal, welcomed the findings, warning that the report 'exposes the lies and deception that mark China’s so-called transplant 'reforms.' The falsification of the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS) data appears to be part of an elaborate cover-up that disguises the state-run mass murder of innocent people for their organs in China.'...”  Zak Doffman is the Founder/CEO of Digital Barriers—a company providing advanced surveillance tech to the defense, national security, counter-terrorism and critical infrastructure sectors.
Don't give wallstreetbets credit for this. Look on reddit majority are clueless about silver
Liars! Lying media is just pushing you to buy silver. No WSB post trended to buy silver
Some years ago, I bought what would pay my real estate taxes for 3 years in silver, just in case.  I could use some increase in value, so this is great. Hope we get a solid bottom at $28 or so.
Media is manipulating people do not buy silver it is all a hoax
I don’t buy it...
Fuck. I only have 60oz that I purchased at around $22 spot at the time.  Wish I had at least 600
Literally no one at WSB is buying into the silver BS. $GME to the moon 🚀
Silver everywhere! Just cost twice as much as two years ago. Try finding ammo!
Hi-ho silver!!!
"this wall street's bet group" lmao. nobody wants your goddamn silver
Ok Boomer
so, people are creating an artificial demand for silver to bloat the price
DONT SELL YOUR SILVER !!!
This interest in silver is a ploy created by large hedge funds who own a lot of call options trying to make their money back from shorting gme. This is fake news relating this to wsb
All what you have to do... buy what you can find and hold it. Go on with your life and you will never never regret that you did

Don’t buy silver!!!
i don't get the milk and eggs part
Please do not be an idiot and buy silver contracts its just citadel trying to steal more money
Silver is Real Money. It has been money for 4,000 years. (don't trust me, look it up) The Reddit Group is just accelerating what will happen in the future when we all start to realize the paper in our pockets is only monopoly money. China and US have been hoarding Silver and Gold for Many Years. Ask yourselves why. Also, Under Biden, the US  is poised to create more than 2 million more solar panels in the next 3 years. Each panel  requires 3/4 ounce...and that's just the US. China has a goal of over 10X in the next year alone. That's only 2 countries and will be more silver required than we can source.  Then there's electric cars, water purification, cell phones, computers..etc. etc. Check Mate.
John 3:16-17 16-For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
It's a trap! Dont buy silver! The billionaires that lost their money are trying to get it back. Reddit users aren't telling people to buy silver. They are telling people to stay away from it. The media and these other groups are trying to get you to put your money into silver, raise the price, then they are going to sell off and plummet the price and you will lose your money. DONT BUY THESE LIES!
Just bought my very first 14 oz of silver!
don't think this guy understands anything morgan is saying
jamie demon and ppt
Problem in commodities is that it's not a real market.  As the video says, gamblers (and that's what the banks who are shorting silver are) simply pretend to buy and sell the commodity.  THEY SETTLE IN CASH!!!  THEY DO NOT DELIVER THE COMMODITY EXCEPT ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CASES.  This isn't a real market.  If in fact those holding the contracts had to buy and sell actual silver, there would be a default on delivery very quickly.  Can't have that, so government entities will come in to stop it.  That might not work if confidence in the system breaks down.
GME to the moon! 🌙
Got 30 coins from my local dealer!  Let's do this

WALLSTREET BETS IS NOT TARGETING SILVER, this is how the media destroys us.  go to wallstreetbets and check, Citadel Hedgefund has 3 billion invested in silver.  PS, i love silver, been a stacker for years, but spreading this BS is hurting the one movement that may finally force the power elite to make the markets fair and open.  GME BABY
Lol, GME and AMC hit resistance because RH limited buying and still is limiting buying. Silver to the moon!
Total bs
A quick visit to r/wallstreetbets can tell you NO ONE cares about silver, nice try though
This is a blatant diversion away from GME 😂😂😂
Fake news
No one is buying silver. Hold GME.
fake news wallstreetbets never said to buy silver
Id like to see them all get squeezed, but have my doubts.  Maybe if every person in the nation spent every  last dollar  on it then i could see it working.
BS. Everything. Rumors placed out right before expected uptrend.
Crash JP Morgan!
Fake news
Don't fall for the silver. Keep buying GME and AMC, show them that we can hold forever. Make them pay for a change.

Silver is a trick, you can’t squeeze silver like we saw with amc and GME. Don’t buy silver and I own a bunch of physical silver but that’s not the play.
Silver buy call is not even true...does any one cross check or go blindly.
😂🤣
Can you eat silver or does it keep me dry and safe? Keep up the fake destruction of US currency. It's cute. America is so dramatic for 0 reason.
I'm a big fan of silver.   That said this is absolutely not the focus of r/wallstreetbets.  They are focused on the GME squeeze.  All you have to do to double check me is go to their forum and read the first few posts to see for yourselves how this whole "reddit army jumps on the silver squeeze" narrative is completely false.   Good luck and happy trading!
Melvin capital: level 1 boss, JPM = The final boss
SCAM .... Do not buy silver people. It will drop dramatically in a week or two ,.. Wall st trying to get their money back .
Kitco=untrustworthy
Get the douche that said there was more than plenty of silver back on! Why would he bold face lie?
Biden protects wallstreet they cashing in before the massive crisis and all investors flow over to crypto and bitcoin.

Don't buy SLV. Citadel is paying off the media and pushing propoganda. Buy GME.
Kitco is playing with the baddies. Citadel has a shit tone of silver contracts and is trying to engineer a silver "short squeeze" in order to take pressure off of GME and dump their contracts to pay for the losses. Pay attention people.
Literally nobody is talking about silver on reddit for anyone who's unaware. It's propoganda.
Cant wait until the the private mints find out many of the Comex bars are cored.
You are feeding a false narrative. No one on r/WSB wants you to buy SLV. The hedge funds do though.
Way to spread fake news
All fake
Good I wasn't buying silver anyway...GME to the moon!
Redditors aren't buying Silver, this is a lie. You can't squeeze silver
I agree that anything under $30 is probably good, but i think people should hold off for now.  Buying into a frenzy is not a good idea.
CHECK REDDIT. They said NOTHING about silver, someone powerful is using the word "reddit" to try getting people to buy silver to increase the price
Hmmm Lot of talk,  Upside is screwing the shorts in coordination,  This guy does not have an unbiased view,
This guy is just trying to pull a side scam.  WallStreetBets is loudly denying wanting silver.  He's trying to convince you that they're going to drive up the price of silver because *he* wants to drive up the price of silver!
Stolen, all stolen You are buying air. Thats all its worth.
How could you possibly be disappointed with the price near $30.
The earth is flat
Fakenews  Hedge funds trying to pump silver to get revenue to pay off thier shorts
False
Buying gold and  silver tomorrow
Lies
That reddit page that started this all... it says this is a trap... where on reddit is it saying buy silver ??
remember 2008   This is the way  Hold the line
The silver push is perpetuated by people looking to make money off it, not redditors.
Fucking lies! Fuck silver!
Reddit is not buying silver, this is a misinformation campaign. top posts on reddit right now are calling this out, don't by silver hold GME and AMC
Obama 2008 crisis. Biden 2021 crisis. Does anyone else see a trend?
The steal is real.
platinum price is also being  suppressed ( look at total physical platinum compared with total physical gold) they may use it to try compensate the silver  short ...
The difference today vs 1980. People did not care in 1980 if the Banks, JP Morgan, Politicians, The FED, and Investment Banks had a Monopoly on Gold and Silver. They had great paying jobs, a house, 2 cars, a retirement package, free healthcare, and enough money to send the kids to college whom in turn could do the same. You could easily make 10% on your money, many times more, up to 20% by just putting it in bonds. Once Reagan made the huge Temporary Tax cuts on the wealthy, that Bush made permanent. Everything changed, in comes supply side Economics, China supply and the stripping of a Nation. The Rich have become 100x more wealthy vs workers. There are NO good paying jobs out of high school. Fast forward to today and these techys want to make quick money, we all do except the elders whom live on a retirement package from Bell Labs, or some city pension fund created in the 1950s.  These old people still dont care about Wallstreet Manipulation, JP  Morgan with Millions in shrt silver contracts that FORCE the price down. Silver should be in the hundreds and Gold close to 30K. The one and only reason is that the banks keep them down forcing you to use the dollar as VALUE. The Politicians are gullible and or paid to protect them.  The Best thing about wallstreetbets making news is the wake up call. In 5 years the 20-somethings and teens will remember. They will go over to crypto's for savings and vaule as the rich continue the decline of the dollar.  What will they do when they are blocked out of trades, told to turn over their gold and silver, and the Government makes Crypto's illegal. All in the name of "protecting you"
Yeah, and Citadel owns most of the silver stock. WSB is even actively saying they are AGAINST investing in silver. The fact that it’s being reported that WSB is FOR it is utter bs.
This is all fake, I am on Reddit and NOBODY is talking about buying Silver! Do not buy DO NOT BUY! So much money to market fake news
GOD SAID DON'T TAKE THE VACCINE HE SPOKE THROUGH HIS PROPHETESS ROSALIND SOLOMON
This isn’t true. DO NOT SELL THEY’RE TRYING TO SCARE YOU INTO SELLING. HOLD THE LINE.
So does citadel have an hold in silver? They using tha media to sway the market?? If you're running Citadel propaganda get payed in .999
Love David Morgan. I’ve kept the faith for years. 💪
Fake news by hedge funds to pay off the short sells from GME
.
THERE IS NOT A PHYSICAL SILVER SHORTAGE. The banks put measures into place to prevent a collective "Hunt Brothers" type scenario by the public. What the public doesn't know is that the banks have those 1,000 oz bars on pallets totalling 600,000 oz each and warehouses full of them. They do not have the logistics to ship those big bars. If they decided to sell off most of those 1,000 oz bars to mints there would be back orders on the physical for many months. Trading would stop before $60 oz. Also by the time most customers gets their physical the price would drop back down to previous levels like $32 an oz. I may also add that mining output doubles at around $35 oz  putting further resistance on the price increasing.
“Silver is all over social media” Wtf no it’s not 🤨 stop trying to manipulate the market GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
we make a transfer to this kiwi wallet, to help the guy, he broke his ear when he went to the bathhouse, we give him as much as we can, here are the numbers +79788389477 (save the kid))
Where's the page ?
As someone who reads Wall Street bets, I promise you no one wants silver
I hope it goes to the moon.  It's a gamble of how long to hold on to.
literally no one is buying silver.
He doesn’t want to say becuase he would get wacked
My Favorite Silver GURU......   Note: $KLSVF $KS is on the move.
Very useful info from David , thank you
Reddit wallstreetbets has nothing to do with silver. They arent trying the gme short squeeze on silver. Billionaires are trying to manipulate the market again
Silver will never go up like the stocks. The regulators at JPMORGAN won't allow it. What needs to happen is a voice on AM RADIO 610AM. Someone who can start a radio station USA reach. Thus, u fall under BS regulation that can't stop real talk. Yes, cuss words are tight. But you can have shows "the equality show" "the inequality show" " metal mania" "wallstreet bulkies"
I love how you listen and don't constantly interrupt. Breath of fresh air.
SLV only helps jpm .
WSB has publicly posted on multiple occasions that they are not squeezing silver at all. Go check for yourself, it's all public.
God bless all
Scam
The silver short squeeze is a LIE. It’s a distraction from GME.
4:02 - 4:52 tells it all...
BTT pump would make us all rich cause its dirt cheap per share .000377  $20 buys 50k shares life changing money super easy to move small cap crypto upward.
So is gold to be seen in the same way then? Put differently: why silver on its own?
Lin is awesome!
Some of the questions posed by the host are on par with his scowling.. wondering what are Buffett’s current views on silver ... his last major venture into silver was back in 1997?
What I am most interested in is what happens if the paper markets have to settle in cash? The precious metals market is manipulated through the dumping of more paper contracts on the market. If SLV has to settle in cash then there is no incentive to create more paper contracts and therefore no way to manipulate the price lower. If that happens then the true price of silver, and gold for that matter, will sky rocket.
I'm a small miner with patented gold/silver and gem claims, keep holding, boys! Davey slays Goliath 😂
The media is pumping that "WallStreetBets is playing silver" - lies! Hedge funds hold call options on silver... they are the ones trying to generate this scam.
This is a scam, don't go for silver, keep on GME hahahahahahahaha
Reddit doesn’t give a shit about silver, this is not real, hold GME
If no silver in the market what you will say about gold.....
I think your wrong 7 million reddit members are ready to buy and hold break the banks and hedge fund crooks
There is no silver short squeeze happening. NONE. NEVER. False media reports about “Reddit traders” moving en-mass into silver, SPACs, or whatever is benefiting hedge funds at the moment is getting out of control.  It doesn’t take more than 2 seconds and a smooth brain to pull up front page of WSB to see that nobody is talking about that shit (except for the bots).  This is a clear case of market manipulation to lure outside investors into a “momentum opportunity” by fraudulently invoking the “reddit army” for whatever is convenient. This shit is getting out of control.
Dont buy paper.. buy physical! This is the way💎🙌
David Morgan looking fit and well.  Appreciate the interview.
Great interview.  I wish Kitco will interview Chris Duane.  He is arguably the best silver guy on earth you want to expose to your viewers.
You can buy silver. I went to the flea market and bought some ley 900. Lol
why are media talking heads talking silver when no one on wsb is taking about it?  metal manipulation, by the owners of media.
Buy PHYSICAL SILVER. Get your assets in your own possession. The game is over. For all of history an average days wage has been a single silver dime. Silver comes out of the ground 8-1 with gold and it has 10,000 industrial uses that gold does not. SLIVER TO THE 🌙 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 👐
WSB doesnt support buying silver as they know Citadel owns a large portion of Silver. They are trying to cover for the GME shorts and the 2billion bail out to Melvin Capital. This is media manipulation.
You can’t but it?
It's time to start on something bigger than gamestop now! Real money!  Money is power and it's time to take our money back.   SILVER IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY SHOTED MARKETS!! It is a much bigger market and it will be harder to move. BUY PHYSICAL SILVER AND HELP THE CAUSE   SILVER is real money. Its time for round 2  Wait for round 3...GOLD
It is time for us little fish to take down the megladon. Lets buy silver and bring them to their knees
If you buy ‘Paper Silver,’ you are actually helping ‘them’ to short silver.  At some point (before the price gets too high}, they will simply close out the paper contracts, give you some funny money, and you can watch from the sidelines as the price of Physical Silver .  .  . Goes Through The Roof!
Davids laugh at 13 seconds was definately a “Im about to get filthy rich” kinda laugh. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Reporting from Turkey 🇹🇷, there is no supply here too...
Misinformation about silver
Gme and Amc to the moon.   We need to focus
Silver is the most undervalued asset in the world. Just compare it with any asset. Even Picasso’s.
🤔honest markets⁉️🤦‍♂️😂
Don't buy silver . The hedgefunds are long on silver it will help them directly.
"This wallstreetbets group" LOL. Love you David but this is sad. WSB is 100% DIAMOND HANDS in GME right now and explicitly disclaim any attempt by the media to blame the sub for this activity. Just another desperate scheme from the modern Robber Barrons.
Got burnt in 2008, lost my house, my business,  my health.  Been buying silver the entire time, bit by bit.  A huge rise would be very welcome.
Just bought more physical
Nobody is shorting silver, they’re pumping the price for friends
This is complete bullshit. Wsb is focusing on gme and AMC. This is a false presentation of the situation with silver and wsb. Shame!
What's with all the show hosts? Buy all the silver you want at Onegold. Reliable and well positioned
If you can't connect the dots from the past year of alleged "coin shortage" CREATED by the banking industry for dual purpose forcing businesses to charge/pay billions in "card use fees" and now manipulation of market in hoarded silver. HORSESHIT!!!!!!!
Ya called 30 on the open. Morgan is the man!!!
This is why gold hasn't behaved the way it should. Not scarce if you can just print it.
I get my silver for free. Its in everything that has an electric switch and relay. Then I refine it myself. There is an endless supply.
Not true....WSB is not pushing silver. Its BS. Buying silver is great for Citadel. WSB says dont fall for it. Its pulling attention away from Gamestop and AMC...
Buying Silver 👍
So MUCH lies. No one on WSB is talking about Silver. Check it yourself.
Its not WSB who say buy silver. Melvin Capital is the 4th largest silver holder. They are trying to compensate their losses, by spreading fake WSB tweets. Why should the real WSB hurt the hedge fonds and then give them all the money back, by pushing silver. That makes no sense at all.  Nevertheless because of the whole reddit thing thats going on, people see the massive potential in the silver squeeze. The price was squeezed over years by the banks, who shorted silver. If people keep buying silver, banks are going down. This will bring tons of new people to cryptocurrencies.   Personally I bought silver coins today. I want to see the real value of silver.
The more waste created by governments, the higher the cost of silver will go. Think about this.
Almost 30 bucks at 745am est Feb 1st
Why have Americans started pronouncing 'bullion' as 'bull-ee-yon'. Bouillon  is a French onion soup? This ridiculous trend in pronunciation started about three or four months ago and now everyone is latching on and calling it onion soup. The correct pronunciation is 'bull-yin'.
The Chinese do. Check Shanghai
Gold future 55000$oz,silver 12500$$ for 2023,my guess..paper garbage
always remember, no cryptos without silver. you need elecrtonics;)
I wouldn't  sell my silver for even 1000$,paper money is garbage!!!lol mother fudgers!!eat paper!!
Perth Mint still has 100oz bars in stock
He sounds like Joe from family guy 😭
LOL. I love David's giggle at the very beginning.
I wish everyone who owned paper gold and silver requested a delivery in the next couple of weeks. A new kind of shock and awe would ensue!
Can anybody tell me what the name of the instrumental song is at the end of this video?
Fellas, this is big. Wall Street Bets Silver
if you're going to buy metals get physical!
I have crypto but I put a bit of silver away back in 2010-11. Forgot I had it lol
And when the  U.S. government steps in and says silver will be set at $15/oz. to "Save the economy" or whatever? Wouldn't surprise me......
You think people have it figured out.  Sell your Silver for what?  Worthless paper!  Hold and watch what unfolds!  Simple Supply and Demand.
buy FIRST MAJESTIC SILVER
He sounds like Kronk: "Oh yeah, it's all coming together."
wow... a lot of excitement in here. Coooooooooooool down people. Needs to get above $30 and hold there, then we'll talk $40 and $50.
💎🙌
Very well done. Love the channel
I own physical... sitting on it
I have always said that “MONEY IS FREEDOM”!
Nobody from WSB getting into silver. It's a 1.5 Trillion dollar industry compared to a few billion on GME. Media nonsense
good interviewing David, keep up the quality content <3
buy physical...... everything else is BS
The beginning of the bank run.
whats going on? they are holding the silver.
Ordered some physical just to be part of this movement.. “Say Squeeze” 😬
Wow the length you guys go to capitalize on something else. Ahaha  WSB already posted 3 times  they have nothing do with this.  But we know who ordered this circus the same people who’s re sitting in actual massive piles of silver. Google - Goldman & Sachs silver or Warren Buffet silver and the list goes on.  Lol just go to eBay and you’ll find piles of silver ready for you to buy. This is their second theater and the person who came up with this plan is an imbecile. That’s how desperate they are 😂😂
2021: The year of Silver.
Its JP Morgan
the silver hype is an attempt to draw attention away from GME, HOLD GME
This is a trick
its real baby!!!
Nobody here talks about Silver Stocks.....check their Chart History and see what happens if Silver squeezes.....
13:00 $1,000 oz Thats the goal!
I could buy 2kg only. Just to support you guys. And I will not sell it at all.
JP Morgan paid millions of dollars in fine in manipulating the silver market.   If people buy silver, the crook banks are going under.
small silver bars are hard to get even before the reddit drama
When the silver physical market becomes too tight and people are looking for 90% silver, that’s it.
100+
Destroy the silver shorts (JPM) and make yourself some money or physical silver.  Don't need Robinhood and their stock quotas/limits for this.  Goto your local silver seller/pawn etc and buy.  Silver Eagles are 99.99% silver and older silver dollars are typically 90% silver (ask for a lower price on these).
Multiply your time horizon by 5 and you'll be less stressed and closer to reality.
We don't need to push physical silver up much we just need to crush silver related stocks. That's where the short sellers will get squeezed.
Because they are hoarding it... been trying to buy all day and places like apmex says they are "out of stock"... They aren't selling but they are buying... they say the biggest short squeeze ever is about to happen
Buy Buy and Only Buy... Physical
lets get physical physical    phsyical is the way to break it! demand physical! they are unbacked contracts I'm with Bill Murphy it should be 50$ all day long this is nothing yet
GUYS. ITS STARTED! XAG
Well done, finally someone helps us to go against the Goliaths!
Artificial supply, so manipulation again.
buy silver
Prepare Yourself:  JP Morgan (classic silver shorter) maybe on TV crying today.  Bought some SLV today.   =Puts pressure on commercial silver bars.  Silver Liberation Army 2021 = We are back taking physical silver off the market,  destroying these shorts.
In the meantime a real future oriented stock like battery producer Neo Lithium Corp is sinking away .
SVL, a silver miner on the Australian ASX went up 49% today.   Crazy. I wonder if it will rub off on gold?
WSB say it isn’t them, but a trap by the establishment looking for GameStop revenge. Petty. 🙄
I wish the "hunt brothers" were still with us now...
Only imagine if the hunt brothers had us to back as well it would be super short
I would recommend everyone watch the YT Atlantis report: 11 reasons why a silver short squeeze is possible.
the peoples money. best comment
The best and advisable way one could be a millionaire is by spending less and investing more {e.g Cryptocurrency investment (bitcoins) is really the best way to make
Buy physical silver now boys before it goes to $100  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I don't know if I should despise these people for ruining my monthly silver run, or if I should be proud of there being more people at least interested in silver.
The game is in our favor, if price goes up we make tremendous gains, if price goes down it's an opportunity to buy more for less
The way to play given this situation is to get into SLV, PSLV, options, futures as well in addition to buy the physical.  Because the dealers will jag up the premium if the demand for physical is that high.  Also, physical supply is limited on retail side.  Ordinary people won’t easily get their hands on 1000 oz bars, but they can all buy 1 share of SLV.  Imagine 1 million WSB each but 1 share of SLV on Monday....
Just noticed David deleted a 2011 youtube video from his channel telling everybody that silver was going to $60.  His clients lost of fortune in the proceeding years, I remember a lot of anger at the time.   His name was dirt by 2015.  Looks like the next generation has latched on. Silver is in a bull phase but when CPM group says sell, you better sell.  See what happened to those who traded against CPM over the past 40 years. By going long and short the metals with superb timing, CPM returned over 15,000% for clients who invested when the company was formed from the J. Aron buyout.   CPM is still looking for a long term metals peak 2023-2025.
The price will not be long at 30, could soon reach 50 and when the squeeze begins then to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
Don’t get mad, get silver, get even
Its world wide, here in Spain the dealers are almost out of stock too and limiting sales.... this is BIG!
Buying silver is just like buying lotere because you have a chance to multiple, the risk is not so high since it's still so cheap and physical
Looks like this story is gaining traction and capturing people's imagination around the world. But the key is that investors must  stick with funds (e.g. ETCs) that are backed by physical silver and not just secured on paper contracts. Then the key is to use your stake in the fund to demand the silver in the vaults. Take delivery! It's YOUR SILVER. Once the realisation dawns they don't have enough or are lying about how much is in the vaults then the PRICE OF SILVER WILL SHOOT TO THE MOON.
4:09 THE GREATER SHARKS THAT WE DONT NOW EXACLY.  WTF ! (IN WHAT MOVIE ARE WE IN?)     8-O
I just bought a shitload of it! hahahahhahaahha
Gümüş alın lan adamın canını sıkmayın🤡
Don't buy silver
David is the real American Dad or Joe from family guy :)))
We're the hunt brothers now.
First majestic moon. It's on.
David Lin...You  are an excellent interviewer and reporter...But you are beginning to become  anxious...talking twice as fast...trying to satisfy your friends and yourself.  You are losing your Objectivity. Step back....Take a deep breath, bud. Re-form! Kitco needs you. We need you!.....
Lin for the win
BUY PHYSICAL BULLION !!!
Yes!!!
Paper currency sucks, people.
If its really a good time to buy silver do you really think KITCO is gonna want you to BUY SILVER and TELL YOU ABOUT IT XD.  PEOPLE PEOPLE PEOPLE. GME is the plan, this is nothing but FLUFF! don't be fooled.
Game-stop was $2.82 in march 2020 crash and $313 in 29th friday- january 2021. (WOW)
As I type this, spot AG is about $29.30. My son wanted cash, and offered to sell me four of his generic rounds for $30 each.  I jumped at the deal. Sucker.  :)
Also biden is hemoraging trillions per day out of this country. Kinda adds fuel to this fire. I think reddit will throw over 1-20 billion into silver for the lols
All this paper crap need to go
Silver paper market is a racket.
needs a mustache
GME IS LOVE, GME IS LIFE
Chile’s National Institute of Statistics  reported that the country’s Mining Production Index fell by 9.3% in December 2020 when compared to December 2019. The Institute said that the metallic mining sector, in fact, saw a 9.7% decrease in copper extraction and processing in the last month of 2020.
Everybody has a chance to join this revolution. Buy physical. Create the demand. Lets go! This is the last chance to take a stand!
I went in the last days in december and i was getting fucked for weeks. This is our fucking revenge. Lets us all HOLD to 1000$.
New to Kitco. Love your style. Short, informative and to the point. No waffling, blah blah. Thank you for that. A work of caution to folks who are looking to buy physical silver coins - make sure it is real silver and not silver plated brass. I have subscribed.
the thing s in wallstreetbets are saying that is not them is the funds to reaise capital dont belive them
SILVER $29.70 now
People are being manipulated into taking part in this "Silver Squeeze" not realizing that it could destroy the world economy. Prepare accordingly. Gold over silver all day anyway. This is the Great Reset. This is how they accomplish destroying the world economy. And they get to blame it on you and me even though the economy was already going to implode. This is merely the match that lights the flame.
Apparently you guys aren't following wsb. They have stated emphatically that there is no retail run on silver.
SILVER IS GONNA MAKE ALOT PEOPLE RICH!!
Swan dive
silver is pumping like a shitcoin looooool
I smell bank blood
you can get maples here in vancouver $5 cad over spot
This seems like an advertisement clocked in a news wrapper. Deception does not garner trust.
I bought my Silver bars today 😎
Great hearing it from the horse's mouth.  Keep us posted please.
I'm a Forex and Gold Trader. Last Silver trade I made is years ago. Ever since JPM controles the market with their massive shorts, silver for me became a market that always promises and never delivers. Well, this morning, just 45 minutes ago, against all technical analysis, I made a (very small) total nonsense trade: I'm long on Silver.  and oh look.. .against all technical sense, the damn thing crawls up. Fly Silver fly, I'm in and I will hold.. I will hold... and I will hold until they bleed.... for the brave WSB guys xD
Even if silver quadrupled, it wouldn't make a difference.  I purchased silver in case of catastrophe for barter.   So, no interest in putting a few thousand dollars in my pocket.
EXPECT THE CRAZIEST RALLY ON SILVER starting tomorrow. 9:30. A.M ..this is going to make history. ....
This is a planted story. Buy silver if you believe in it, but it has nothing to do with what's happening with GME, wallstreetbets etc. Silver is not "on fire" on social media like they say. It's bot accounts. Citadel owns a truckload of silver bonds and tries to divert attention away from GME.
I have my physical sitting right next to me.  Not selling.
Very good interview
I bought some physical silver today and will be taking delivery this week.
_Lmao this isn't us, this is hedge funds over-inflating a market that they want to capitalize from. Btw silver only went up 6% last week. Don't buy silver, keep your $GME / $AMC. Hold the stonks!_
copper squeeze
Silver squeeze is a lie. Hedge funds have huge positions in silver. This guy is only wishing this to be true.
You cant buy silver anywhere at the moment what are you talking about host !
spartans, HOLD!!!
This is just to distract you from Gamestop
I bought 1,100oz this week to support my children's future. Fiat currency feeds war, poverty, propaganda, lies and corruption. I just helped defund it a little more. Long live the truth. Long live real value. Death to fractional reserve banking. Death to rehypothecation.
I am going to buy more lead. Considering the current state of politics I think it will get even more valuable.
Anyone with paper need to call them in for bullion same like JPM etc..
Central Banks no longer own the majority of gold.  It has all been confiscated.
David, why don’t you tell people the step by step process to buy 1000 ounce bars that will break this market open?
David Lin, who cares about silver.  The important question is, did you win your chess game?
Let them play the papermoney. We get the real.
Why 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ another games...
Silver to the moon!!!
Where are the naked silver short memes?
Just dumped my lifesavings into Dogecoin
*The fact that Silver is now at or close to $27 says it all: nobody trusts the dollar any more, as they are printing money almost as fast as they're spending it.  The 27 TRILLION dollar debt - along with the ongoing devaluation process ("Quantitative Easing" - a rose by any other name) - has finally brought down the mighty Dollar.  At this point metal - ANY metal - is the only safe market for storage of wealth.*
Early days yet BUT on the charts it looks as though there could be a roll out of stocks into GLD & SVL  Stocks going down GLD & SVL  going Up ,  Allot!
Real silver ! No paper.
the market cap of silver is just much higher, so it moves less than gamestock,...
primarily is rredit walstreet bets! the lying spreads everywhere! this was bound to happen sooner or later!
“If people are happy with paper silver” LMFAO, I’m going to get some silver coins tmrw!
Nobody gives 2 fucks about silver. This is fake
physical bullion in the hands of investors is the path to price discovery.
Ohhh the panic may just be starting Monday morning
He asked who is the head of this shark 🦈 group . I will tell you it’s the Illuminati organization Rotschchild is the main , Rockefeller, Skull and Bones. Jacob Rotschchild is the man head of everything right now. . This guys love suppressing and  playing with gold and silver.
You can buy anything you want regardless of supply the lower the supply the more you pay but so does everyone else.
Down with the Wallstreet fks!
It’s gone up 1$ and people losing their minds 😂
nobody knows jpmorgan could dump on them?
it is coming!!!
Good and comical interview both Davids👍 more so to David presenter. Good to see your natural personality traits. Makes everything more fun
@8:15 sure, ok? You only talked about meeting demand for all the retail buyers, sure I get that, but say you still have to meet the demand for your commercial market as well, ad that to the mix and you have a voodoo brew going, and as an added insult, trying to keep prices in check with the astronomical increase in energy cost (not even an argument, that's skyrocketing) for mining companys, dear say a perfect storm?
EVERYONE BUY, and then stop using Reserves.  Use your silver between each other and cancel out the banks and return to a Gold Backed Currency market and a Silver Trade Market.  This in itself kills the reserves dead in the water.
Not good.
SLV will destroy the biggest banks, not just some little hedge funds. Go for it Silver, BUCKLE UP!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yeah man, the sheep witnessed how rigged the financial system is, thanks to WSB. Little guys, game on. Bravo!
Ya ya ya the wallstreet guys are scary they have special skills the retail investor's don't posses. Total bullshit.
"Vote with your fiat"
It's easy to buy silver right now if you want to pay excessive premiums.
Just bought 100 ounces. Let's go.
A name you can thank if this comes to fruition: Eric Sprott maybe the main guy in the world walking the the Silver walk not just talking the talk. The guy has been a lifeline to many o miners that needed a lift during turbulent manipulated times. along with David Morgan, hats off to Eric Sprott "The Good Guys in Silvertown"
Going all in in a couple days
Border gold in Vancouver has physical silver anyone wanting to buy some.    Canada's Leading Gold & Silver Dealer | Border Gold
WHERE THE HELL DO I GET A MORGAN ROUND?????🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Just like we've said all along the markets are manipulated, all of them.
I SEEN PEOPLE SELLING SILVER ON CRAIGSLIST
So this is where my old high school sports coach went! Into the silververse.
300$ an oz coming.
David Lin is the man!. The guy is well spoken, well informed, and is just prepared every interview.
BS!
I just bought some silver an hour ago online. Wtf?
I have been waiting for this moment since 08.
Buy silver
This is a scam! $GME to the moon!!
It is not just Reddit user, it is a global commodity. you think that asian and south asian doesn't like their silver? It has turn from a Reddit fight to a global fight agaist manipulation of a global commodities. and when the worlds buy COMEX, LMX, and CME will never be allowed to get away with it.
Thank you!
GOT 67 OUNCES TONIGHT LOL,GOT 30 FROM JM BOULLION BEFORE SIGHT CLOSED,ANOTHER 37 FROM EX GIRLFRIEND,CRAZY TIMES.
Does SLV or any other silver stock have such high short positions ?
Swap to Gold, Silver supply is done... price can easily be pushed to 2300.
I saw on Twitter that Kitco was reneging on silver orders to their customers on Sunday night.
This is the catalyst for the "Great Reset" you dummies!
JPM Chase is the biggest Bankster manipulating silver by writing naked short future contract to control the price of Silver.
soon if you dont buy silver you're on the jeffery epstein side of things
He wishes silver was scarced 🤣🤣 keep your worthless metal unless you have a factor you're fucked against the digital market
LIAR. FOCUS ON GME
dont fall for this crap, wall street owns a bunch of silver and gold, they'd never short that as silver and gold are hedges against USD. These idiots are just trying to get you fools to buy into it so they make more money.
Scottsdale Mint still has silver available, buy now!
Who says you cant?
physical silver so much more sexy than paper silver
Gold and silver
WOW！
cut at a loss
cant they just cancel the short sell orders?
If investors are willing to accept paper silver, let's see them sell their paper silver to be used to conduct solar energy.
This does not come from wsb, this is a distraction by shorts from Gme, gme is still the play, gme to the moon
The Force Majeure is strong in this one ;)
I OWN 600 SHARES OF SLV
What a load of shit lol. Citadel is the 5th largest owner of SLV. Don't listen to this boomer shit. Hedgies trying to cover those losses on $GME. SLV is not the play, it's not going anywhere.
Silver bugs trying to get some WSB reddit fans but failed miserably. Game over.
this is the way
shame you want to avoid talking about paper silver  what are you hiding
You can buy silver. This isn't true!
Buy alllllllllllll the silver shit is going too blow you will never see this price ever again silver is worth more there gold
Feels like a medium term top in silver is coming soon! Remember buy silver crash JP Morgan?   Uggh!!
Silver is work 7k per oz if not manipulated
Hold yours GMEs no manter what.
I made the mistake of buying silver in 2013 when it was at $30.  I still haven’t recovered from that.  Do not buy right now.  It’s too high and premiums are through the roof.  It will not go much higher as people have been saying forever.  In fact, it will drop in value.  I’m about to sell everything I bought in 2013 to take a loss.
Wonder how many Hedge funds are long on silver
Gonna have to buy $SLV in the morning since the Physical is out of stock everywhere
all i want is comex replaced by decentralized exchang. When there is no check and balance for their action they are most probably corrupted. god how many time they will sell and purchase the paper.
Silver let’s gooooo!
silver bag hodlers getting paid with devalued dollars . Rektd.
Just picked up 1kg physical
Ebay is a great and safe place to buy gold or silver. Just a few mouse clicks and a few days and its in your mailbox.
Hey doofus you can buy silver. I just bought some !
We aint sellin at 30, we are waiting for at least 50.
Squeeze like you've never squeeze before.. silver that is ?? ...
If you do some research you will see the wsb group is not pushing to buy silver, fake accounts are saying its wsb pushing this idea to pick up more momentum. Silver looks good buy they are not the ones do it, they are more focused on stonks. Nice try tho 😁
the hedge funds we are against will make billions if you buy silver.  Dont be dumb, the only stock that matters is GME
The frightened frightening full fumbling functional polo conceptually increase because cirrus naturally jam versus a roasted step-daughter. maniacal, best smell
there will be some resistance becuase of paper hands. diamond hands i dont want to sell my 2 ounces lol
If silver goes to 1000 the economy will take years to come back literally
Cost average in. Buy 20% of the total you want.
3.55: Plunge Protection Team might thwart the Short Squeeze on Ag
buy physical
Go you good thing i got 16 kg today   $36.50  oz  Australia
We are in the long haul of conviction. Ag Silver is far more precious  now and into the future,  than Au gold will ever be again. If you don't hold, you don't own it.
SUCH BULLSHIT. I BUY SILVER EVERY WEEK.... I DON'T  BUY SILVER STOCK OR GOLD STOCK OR BITCOIN STOCK BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS THEIR LITTLE FINGERS IN THE PICKLE JAR!!!!!! EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
For every ounce of physical silver, there’s somewhere north of 500 paper claims to it. With silver guru David Morgan mentioning that when derivatives are added in, it’s likely even larger than that.
Squeeze the shit out of the suits...
Morgan Vs Morgan - The fight of the Century!
Been said along time imo now , maybe the real mass is waking up . Buy gold/silver/bitcoin and hold  !  If millions would do it at the same time , the world change in a instant ...
Hoo iz manipulainn mr.rodgers says can you say jpmorgun
Silver shortage is a lie ...
he looks like the guy from the mega mind ngl, looks legit.
David Lin, David Morgan both great guys. Although seemingly humble it's quite apparent that David Lin is crammed with great thoughts and perspectives
Fake pump
I knew I wasn't stacking for nothing
David, how can someone buy a commercial bar (1000oz) ?... they are currently cheaper than a single Bitcoin...
man, they aren't kidding!  I bought some valentine days coins as gifts several weeks ago and i'm looking for them now on kitco and nothing is showing up for silver!
When my friends ask, "should I buy Silver now?" 🤦
eBay is showing RECORD sales of silver and dealers are SOLD OUT yet the market is fighting hard to suppress the price
I remember that it was stupid then in the 1980s and dumb now. Don't try to cover up the inevitable bubble pop because of Biden destroying our markets and economy  It is coming and you know it.
Much bigger fight! Buy any physical you can find and HOLD. This is just the beginning!
DOGE is about to take off this week 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I say we f\_/k em... As long as we can and make them exchange in cash!
This is an advertisement.
Does anyone have a link to where you can see the short positions in Silver
Monster short squeeze in silver market coming!!!
BUY ZW WHEAT FUTURES  PEOPLE WILL BE CELEBRATING WITH BEER ALL YEAR MAKING $$$
FIRST, let's get to $50 an ounce for silver; then talk afterwards. Endless is the  speculation how high and when silver will move.
Just bought 240 Kilos only because we need to Fight for our freedom and for our children.
Why is there a back order on silver? Why not just raise the price???
What are they using silver for? Perhaps a conductor ??
See you at $42.  This year
Silver has some resietance at 1000usd!
Buy and hold. Get what u can if u can.  And by get, I mean physical.
Wall Street is probably just going to sell additional paper contracts into the market and reduce their exposure to shorts. I think the Reddit'ers will find it's not quite as easy to cause a silver squeeze as it is on GameStop stock. The big difference is that they can just create more silver contracts out of thin air.
Hedge funds bought silver, not retails.. they want ppl to get into silver instead of gme
I’m with vanguard. How do I buy gold and silver??
Literally it was only 11-13 dollars an ounce before the pandemic now it's about 30 average no way I will stack right now.
Wallstreet bets take us gold to silver ratio 1:15
@ ALL BUY ONLY PHYSICAL SILVER BULLIONS. WE CAN CHANGE THE MARKET WE CAN CHANGE THE SYSTEM WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD WE HAVE THE POWER WORLDWIDE. WE ARE THE 99,98% :-) Good BYe J.P and other MANIPULATORS.......
Silver is going to break out big and i mean big! it's game time folks
If you can't hold it,  you don't own it! Don't buy paper certificates.
Everyone is sold out!  I bought yesterday at $45 and price doubled overnight $71  CIBC is sold out.  So is TD bank !!
Isn't the market cap of silver way larger than GameStop?  It must be much harder to raise the price of silver through mass buying, surely?
Anyone  can  buy  Silver  on  Apmex  ,  JM  Bullion  ,  Ebay  ,  and  many  other places !!   You  can  buy  20  monster  boxes   of  eagles  on  JM  ,  you  can  choose  from  50  100  oz  bars  on  Ebay  ,  so  supply  is  down , but  not  exactly  a  major  shortage !   Many  , many ,  other  places  has  silver  , lots  of  90%  out  there  too .   Big  disconnect  from  the  actual  price , I'm  seeing  $38  an  ounce .
APMEX isn't selling silver!
Is it just me ? I feel like hedge funds want ppl to spend money on silver not GME , so they send out rumors everywhere ! Btw WSB doesnt want you to short squeeze  silver
No supply my ass, they are just waiting to see where the price goes before they sell any more
smoke and mirrors. GME is still the real short squeeze.
Premiums will Rise with demand and price with  example of $100 Silver $200 Physical
Just checked Scottsdale Mint - they seem to have plenty of stock . Have purchased from them 3 ? times . Good people.
It's in. Thier vaults... Already... They are selling paper just like the gold bust before. You can't get physical silver
I’m not interested in buying more silver BUT I’m so glad that the Reddit folks are sticking it to the people who have suppressing asset prices for so long! Do it for GDX and GLD too, you guys! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
What a crock of shit
I hope silver has a massive rally so I can finally dump that shit
SILVER TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
Will it drive up the silver price?  I have 500 ounces in my safe deposit box
Perth mint has sold out
I got a few hundred oz in silver, also not for sale.
WallStreetBets are the biggest Hedge Funds in the world right now..
LMAO bad censorship
i hate derivatives ! buy physical then not problems
Demand because it's not a stock and the tax man can suck it ~>
Mining ratio seems to be 8:1 silver to gold. Then silver price should be up of 180 per oz even on a ratio of 10:1 lets say give it more margin should be close to 100 per oz should be acceptable. Not 27.
1 oz for every person in the U.S. and Canada would crush it!!!
the SOROS family is trying to take control of silver,, they own the quatom fund , that finasced  sunshine mint that makes all the silver blanks for all the US SILVER EAGLES ,  plus the guy ,kimbal , owns 10 silver mines ,mostly in south america , so will have some say where the silver will move too  , soros family, lent  money for the merger to kimbai that own the silver mines
i think there is a lot of physical silver that can be melted into small pieces for the retail market...a real lot.  although many governments and central bankers may not want to part with it if there is a "reset" coming...
"As long as people are satisfied with paper silver the game can go on indefinitely." Heh.
Keep buying sliver retail, keep the pressure up
Silver will Rise Violently!
Thank you so much!! I have been waiting for this long time... I was right about the manipulation market..
Phisical silver prices can go to moon
if we raise the stock prices they liquidate physical for top dollar like jp morgan is very capable of.
The Morgan Report is well worth subscribing to.
what do you mean we dont know.  FACT: JP MORGAN HAS THE LARGEST PHYSICAL SILVER COUNT , FACT: JP MORGAN HAS BEENG SHORTING SILVER FOR YEARS.
Yep..tried to collect my silver that was  Stored..nothing there...got credit note..😡😡😡
Yes .... get even. Buy silver and hold forever.
Its to do with the hyper inflation of the USD
I have personally been waiting for silver to go back down before purchasing, but once it popped back over $26 I figured it's time to bite the bullet.
Future up 7% :)
Davids working on Sunday. Great work.
Which silver stock should I buy?
Can't go wrong by buying silver. Anything under $50 you'll be safe long-term easy.
I am behind 1 just started only have 100 ounces
Buy PSEC also.
Please, please, the 99% need this to go on the long haul to shut down the corruption that is out of control..... Shut them all down PLEASE.....
They mine 8 ounces of silver for every 1 ounce of gold. Half of this 8 ounces is used for the industry. The other half, half of it is used in jewelry. And the other half is available for investment. So, it means that only 2/8 or 1/4 of the silver they mine is available for the precious metals market. That means the real price of silver should be around $400 or more.
Agree..bars unavailable and can't open up accounts on other sites...it's crazy DOWNUNDER 😢
Nobody will sell his silver if you see 5% a day😉.  Hodl!  🚀🚀🚀
Buy silver...get it delivered
LMAO at the paper silver people... LOL....
this show is pure manipulation
Jpm
Great guest. Haven't heard him before but I appreciate him being a straight shooter and not fluffing up his words
Lets run it up !
“ market not short of commercial bars.... YET”.   Wait few hours then
I want these fools to short the paper silver to drop the price of silver because I will be buying physical silver at lower prices....
I'm in Indonesia also buying a lot of silver..!!
The smart people are all LOL at everyone that owns paper silver and/or virtual silver..... Can those people hear the people that own physical real silver LOL at the Paper owners and Virtual Silver owners....
none of the replies seem available ....control anyone??? damn street low class people
I live in Dubai and here there's never a shortage of silver/gold. Plus there are low premiums. Hodler's dream. I don't own any paper, just buying the real metal.
Hi ho Silver
Lol...you can buy it everywhere. Google it. eBay? Local coin shops? Coin shows?
Silver to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Buy silver and eat the rich
In it for the long haul?  Bitcoin.
About 15yrs ago, I went crazy buying Silver and gold coins and bars . Every time that I would get paid, I bought more. Then one day I asked myself why I kept doing buying this stuff and I quit. Haven’t bought since but still have everything that I purchased sitting in my safe. I keep hearing that Silver is coming back and so is my silver bug lol I want to buy more 😂
Let do buying #$100physicalsilver challenge , screw jp morgan .
Let it go up. Makes me money
Silver traders might be smiling right now, but electronics companies are sweating bullets. If Reddit memes silver to 1000$ an ounce like they've been saying, everyone from Nintendo to Tesla are probably going belly up. That or your next phone is gonna require a credit check and a 6 year payment plan.   For most of us, cheaper metals are on balance more beneficial than anything.
Silver bulls should be happy!
Your full of sh!@.  There is no shortage of silver you morons.  Why do you people report crap that isn't true.  Always stirring the pot.
Oh yeah. That damned reddit. Shoot!
The only thing sadder than an orphaned puppy lost in the rain,... is a silver bull.
Wallstreetbets Is calling out the silver short squeeze as BS. I don't know anthing about silver, I just like gme.
The countless printing of US$ from thin air by the Fed to prop up Wall Street is just making people losing faith in the US$
Finally us illegal alien could vote legally and change the corrupt system by buying Silver. Thank you Biden for letting us into this country where everyone wins.
Careful here. Guess with the noise and the excitement of the moment  pay attention to the warning signs of a potential Bear trap.
Of course you can buy silver... or I wouldn't have a job... call any precious metals firm!!! I do this all day everyday... this should be a hell of a week!!!
excellent video!
Thanks gentlemen,
If you have a bit of spare cash go ahead and order some physical. Prices might be high but let's beat them combined together.
Silver is going up, when its $50 spot, WATCH OUT!!!
GME AMC 💎💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🙌
I along with a lot of people have made a fortune in this market. However, who can hear this stuff and want to be a part of it? It is literally a casino! We've always kind of known it but just wrote it off. It's so clear now that it's hard to ignore much longer
I think you guys should go live tomorrow. LOL Maybe at 4?
Actually, you CAN  buy on ebay, but it won't be "cheap"...
Fake news. Stay buying and holding AMC and GME.
Let's all go buying sliver to crash the paper market! 🏃‍♂️
This is better than the Hunt Brothers, this is crowed-sourced Hunt Brothers 2.0 on steroids.  Just keep buying physical.
road to roota
Thank you for having him on during such extra extraordinary circumstances! I love listening to David Morgan
He's so right, precious metal's are the true back on the fiat currency. Look what happened to Ghadiff when he tried to unite east Africa under one currency backed  by his gold reserves. The french with American helped toppled him to preserve the cfa frank back by nothing.
Hello David my name is David
Even before WSBs, you couldn't get a hold of silver and yet silver was reaching deeper lows, something doesn't smell right.   I say because with the current ammo shortage we have 22lr that use to cost 3 cents a bullet for the cheap nasty stuff has jumped to the price that's the equivalent of the type of ammo that Olympians use at the summer & winter Olympics to compete with.   How does Ammo jump from 3 cents to 30 or 60 cents during a shortage, yet with the silver shortages prices kept on reaching new lows?   It's the equivalent of gas reaching 5 bucks a gallon and yet the oil rigs keep on shutting down.
This is going to shoot up silver to more than $200/ounce by end of next month.
Paper derivatives 😆😆😆😆😆😆 FIAT😆😆😆
David sounds excited!!!
If you dont hold it, you dont own it
Respect the old David, respecting the young David
You cant buy because the dealers are crooks like the rest of them. Gouging on premiums waiting to see which way the markets break. There is no free market anywhere.
The Davids working OT 👍
David you are the best interviewer I have seen! You let the guest actually talk at length. Please don’t change. Great interview btw!
APEMEX EMAIL : In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers. For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week. Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.
Does silver goes up mean ppl dont trust the stock market?   In Nov 2008 Silver was $9.50 and goes all time high $46 and then plummet.
First it was Toilet paper, then it was ammo, now it's silver, what's next? Oh yes, I forgot election integrity.
OMGosh, “their wives are mad at them for buying silver”, LOL, my Wife literally is annoyed at me for my enthusiasm of late for Silver. You’ve got me pegged.
there's like 7 million peeps on WSB and how many are just piggybacking there moves. Silvers time to shine!!
Banking Cartels manipulating GOLD and SILVER markets should be crushed and made BANKRUPT.
I only want to hold real money not paper!
That was a good interview. Thanks to you both.
And I will be selling my 100 oz RCM bar into this rally.
Be careful people, the big banks own the most silver at the moment.
It will not hurt the HF's, actually I heard that Citadel is the biggest holder of silver
💜💜💜🙏🙏🙏
Max Keiser and the Winklevii are hyping it hard and I do respect them. But the rumor that WSB is pumping a short squeeze on silver is not true. However not many people outside of the WSB know that and its all over the news that they are doing it. So I expect that silver will rise.
Paper silver is useless. Physical silver is the only thing you should be considering
Can buy from bullionnow in Australia
AG or SLV? 🤔 what's a better call option expiration date? apr? or far 2022 or 2023?
corrupt SEC go to jail
eBay's got silver
Re: "Where are they moving".  The WSB crew are divided, some have started to move into SLV and some have bought physical. But in the latter case, they are not getting them off large international markets they are doing it via shops, and online retailers like Apmex, etc so downstream in some senses.
It'll go up more in the morning when people can physically walk into their bullion supplier and walk out with physical silver.
Call Chumlee first.
Maybe JP Morgan Chase will dump and make a killing? Google to see what they hold.
my toe tells me its $30 soon....
sounds like it's time to buy REAL silver
Every time he lies he closes his eyes . Watch it again and tell me I am wrong .
$100 Silver Lets Go
He’s only referencing the US market and population. Wait till the Chinese start buying✌️
I hope silver jumps to $30, so i can sell my silver holdingssss !
You don't know WHO THE SHARK IS? J P MORGAN
bout time
Buy physical only
Nope silver is bs diversion HOLD AMC GME
My x wife was unhappy at 12 dollars us
I tried to buy on APMEX last night.   They were sold out....
MR LIN IS SMILINIG, FINALY.
How is this an open free market if you can't buy. It's because it's a fixed rigged market for the 1% only.
a big jump comes with a big drop next day !
Hey Davie boy right on grate interview my wife’s been nipping at my heals for wile now. I’m up in the thousands of Oz’s and yeah my heals were getting kinda shot there. I was still able to get my hands another 300 OZ’s   just trying to help out on the shot squeeze. I’ve got gold that I could turn into silver if we need more hitting power. Just to top it off. I’ve been a underground miner chasing this stuff all my life  And since 2008 I’ve been buying it. I’ve got a few nice diamonds 💎 to turn in to silver if need be” why stop now 🩸🩸right?? Have a good one Dave & all my fellow stackers 🧲🧲💰💵💴
It would take 6 years of annual global silver production to cover the outstanding short positions. What else is there to say?
Some dude was selling 60 zips today on Craigslist for $560 a tube of 20 apmex bars for 28 a pop. I missed his call back and once I connected with him it was sold 😤
Silver dump incoming! Haha the big bags going to unload on retail. Shietttttt
This is NOT wallstreetbets. WSB is busy holding GME. This is BOOMERS. The silver short squeeze cannot be executrd by 25 years old boys. Silver Hands. Boomer likes rock.
STOP HACKING SERVER & MY PC. STOP HACKING & CONTROLLING MY TRADE.!!!  :(
100% david
silver should rise over 50 because of the electric real things that are fast becoming reality.
Great information  thank you. I'm getting up early tomorrow, and I'm not going fishing.
Squeeze like it’s the last orange on earth.
Citadel is losing money on game stop and they own slv and there trying to make up there losses
In Morgan we trust!
Silver & Gold is getting beaten down in Asian markets right now...in early trading.   Waiting for Reversal in the morning
You're a class act David!  Rephrasing your initial question reset the tone of that interview instantly.  I've never seen a financial reporter be so quick in reestablishing the right balance with the guest.  Great interview!
It's all rigged. They won't let silver go through the roof or gold until they have their power stripped from them and that won't happen. They'll eliminate anyone that tries to bring them down.
Dahm just sold all my silver 5 days ago
Nobody is mentioning silver on wsb. It's a trick.
Oh yeah, burn baby burn 😁
that's the most common sense I've heard  in 40 years ..
hold the fucking line we taking back the world RIP *new world order* 1815-2020
Yess . I bought one new bar ! Let's go ! !!!!!
This situation has the potential to bring JP Morgan to it's knees. They will be forced to reverse their short position in order to limit their losses. JP Morgan doesn't want to get caught "holding the bag".
They're not pumping silver on WSB. They've banned posts that do... Timing of this is hella suspicious with 120% of GME still being shorted. I'm paranoid enough to think this is a distraction technique.
GME and AMC hit "resistance" because robbing-hood and others refuse to sell, just like they have limited SLV share ownership to just 1 per customer
Wallstreetbets. Doesn't condone the trade of silver its a big wig psyop to recoup the hedges losses
Buy physical and hold!
Google the hunts brothers in the early 1980s your welcome guys, I am long on silver, buy and never sell!! Fuck the system!!!
David Lin you are simply the best! Love your interview with this David too
Conspiracy theory here not saying I believe this just a thought. This whole gme short squeeze could have been intentionally pushed by those at the top and now that its got everybody's attention the next target is silver. Silver short squeeze crashes the economy and who's fault is it according to them, the people and capitalism. World economic forum happens to be there to save the day and initiates a great reset.  Or im just watching too many YouTube videos. Either way I own silver and plan on buying more.
Here this out. Something just occurred to me, will it actually occurred to me the other night but I'm sitting here thinking about it. What if GameStop an the other companies involved in the BIGGEST reverse short squeeze EVER are the company's that the elites are using to ignite the GFR? If you look at the different companies names they're almost telling us that, AMC- the movie is - GameStop- Game Over...
THE MASTER MANIPULATOR IS JPMORGAN JPMORGAN RIGGS THE METALS MARKETS
Silver spot here in Aust is up to over $37.20 plus and one of the best dealers here in Melbourne the server is shut down or crashed, you can’t even get on the site
Chris Duane is being vindicated.
Kitco needs to start selling in India also
Its would be very nice to have other commentators on kitchen news .........
Why are silver guys gloating about physical metals revealing their greatest flaws? Hard/expensive to ship, difficult to divide, difficult to verify, and manipulated from here to eternity... there's no shortage, there's just a sluggish supply system.
I wouldn't be holding paper right now!  Physical Silver is the only way for me.
I’m waiting for Glitter to take off
"Wallstreetbets Group" WSBG has a nice ring to it
Yawn. Can’t even get over 30. Buy the rumor sell the news 19 here we come. Such BS. Silver is a big piece POS
Aww, the interviewer's friends have the Dreaded Paper Hands.  Poor Babies.
Silver will be right next to gold............ and many more people will smile??????
This doesn’t make sense. Demand is so high they that they run out but price is only at it’s previous high? Did supply run out last time too?
This is the way.....buy up every ounce you can find!!
Ignore it, its BIG media trying to get you off $GME
I’ve been watching the prices go up and inventories  crash all weekend! How cool is that!
Apmex has ase for $38.68 right now
HOLD THE LINE!
WallStreetBets don't indorse this on their website. They actually worn against it as a fake from hedge funds
THE OPPORTUNITY IS NOW THE PEOPLES! LIBERTY WILL PREVAIL!!!
David morgan is the man
Paper is looking very attractive it's getting printed everyday a forest at a time....
This is the greatest thing to happen in American history since the Boston Tea Party!  Symbol PSLV is the physical ownership disclaimer on the stock symbol.
Lol yea resistance because of even more market manipulation on the other end! Holding strong because we like the metal! Wouldn't be surprised if the tech companies get in to censor because of all the silver these other markets will keep needing too!
What are the big playas in silver doing?
Buy physical and put the shorts on there knees! If everyone takes ownership of a physical ounce, the system impodes!
There isn't nearly enough actual silver to cover all the paper contracts.
Get in now and buy silver futures before the London and New York markets open. There will be a massive price surge. The banks are already switching to buy side. It’s happening right now.
Apples n oranges  are the next big thing !
Glad I'm a stacker
The " THEY " ( that David doesnt know who it is ) were waiting for you.. Pump it up 2 bucks, every one that buys after that is the sucker .. get to 30 smash it down it will be down  $8 come Friday.. rinse repeat.
This silver squeeze is massive orders from wealthy investors not Wall Street bets. Look at the volume on the comex. No one from Robin Hood is buying comex gold or silver. This was inevitable that silver would sky rocket and WSB will be used as a scape goat for silver “manipulation” and “speculation” by the MSM instead of concentrating on the decades of downside manipulation.
The sharks are the bullion banks, JPM, HSBC, DB, Scotia, UBS, ICBC.
No physical? get futures, stocks, everything you can get your hands on. let's destroy JPM and their corrupt friends. Call in your paper, demand physical, fuck comex
DO NOT BELIEVE  THE DISTRACTION. WSB SAID NOTHING OF SILVER.  GME+AMC IS THE ONLY WAY. STAY FOCUSED.
AMC going to $300+ I feel it in my autism.
Plenty available on Ebay! Get some!
I really don’t see how trying to squeeze silver will hurt these big banks like jp morgan they hold huge silver reserves and if the price of silver goes up their reserves are just worth more. Maybe they lose a tit load of money from shorts but that would take a lot of buying power to move the needle
Silver doesn't have a sell button either
Buy on Ebay, Flea market, pawn and jewelry shop. Come on people.
Sombody broke into my house and stole all my silver bars of 30 years. They took the entire safe full of it in 2011. My lesson...bury it in the yard at night.
15k gold thats cute lol.
Don’t believe the experts David defeated Goliath keep buying physical and hold !
I dont understand why this kitco guy so shocked and looks not happy about whats happening right now.. $SLV buy physical silver now. Break this manipulation on the market.
Its not that there’s no supply and the demand can’t be filled, they are waiting to see what the markets are gonna do so they can hike up the price!!!
Buy and HOLD
If the Dollar is going to Zero, than by definition Silver goes to infinity.
The Network Theory in action.
Im from Australia and just bought 2kg bar and coin no problem
Man this got me so hype
😏
Dollar Cost average. Buy the metal and hold it till it hits $1000
BHS   Bayhorse silver....starting silver production at this precise moment. Minuscule market cap
Price opened up 2$. Its only up 38 cents now lmao
The Davids are right to talk about the sharks.  Gamestop was a little fish in comparison to precious metals.  I wouldn't be surprised if the hedge funds planted a mole into WSB to lead the retail lambs to silver slaughter, as revenge for GME.
It's still available
I couldn't buy a 10 ounce bar of Silver today so instead I bought 1/10 of Gold for $280... they do move together, we will see if the WSB group really targets the SLV or not. Read the threads on Reddit, lots of people just want the target to still be GME
In Israel Vaccinations And Covid Are Both Spiking Higher @t Arab Israelis are avoiding those experimental jabs and not getting covid. These vaccines will destroy the economy!!
That's a fucking lie.  There has been a lack of physical silver and gold since march 2019.
I just went to GameStop to trade in a Mario Bros game and the place was full of hookers, blow, and maskless 20 year olds wearing tracksuits and thick silver chains. 🤑
AG or physical. APMEX fulfilled my order of a stack of 20 eagles just now.
I plan on getting 2kg this week.
I bought the one ounce standing Liberty on Amazon 2 weeks ago for $41 now it's $46 on Amazon
Ask yourselves, who stands to benefit from silver price going up. Don't listen to these shady fucks. Do your own research!
I know David Morgan since many many years and i can tell you, I HAVE NEVER SAW HIM THAT EXCITED about what's going on right now !!!
BUY NOW 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💵💵💵
Max Keiser The Prophet
Gooooo Silverrr 🏆😎
TELL YOUR WIFE TO. . STFU
The way this guy is talking he knows this shit is going to squeeze....I know its going to squeeze
Damn JMBullion is down atm
The Shorts are in trouble, the Hedge funds are going to lose billions betting against silver.
Watch it crash lol
i really like this interviewer. he does his homework and asks impressive questions. bravo bro bravo
Well.. we don’t know exactly 😂
Buy PHYSICAL SILVER!!!!
Now, when you get your silver, or ANY other precious metal...KEEP QUIET! This is an actual product that people may go after if they know you have it(steal it/rob you). Purchase your pm quietly, shhhhhh...
Silver and silver miners 🚀🚀🚀 to soar! Silver short squeeze! Love it!
JPM put away their bag of tricks??
WHERE  CAN I BUY SILVER? THANKS
If you think its some kids with robin hood accounts in their pajamas trading, your'e smoking that good stuff. This is a move thats been in the making with or without reddit traders.
Come on it was almost 50  years ago better plays .
bought 30 oz. today
Nobody knows more and less about silver at the same time than David Morgan, gotta love how this guys answers with humility. Up to 2400 ounces. I just want to hear the silver Godfather say silver is going to $1,000 an ounce.
Been waiting since April 2020 for this. Managed to stack 75 oz of pure silver and 11oz of Morgan’s.
Perth mint is closed for 5 days
You can buy silver anywhere right now... What knid of bullshit is this. I love silver and gold and i hold both. Lying to people with nonesence claims is not the way.
THE SILVER ARMY!!!
I think that group that bought gamestop is playing Wallstreet by faking them out with silver talk.
Buy it boys..find a way. Dont give an inch
No chance that a short squeeze is triggered the same way Game Stop was. But more and more people showing interest in PM's and getting comfortable buying them, will only be bullish.
in addition to scooping up the physical... don't let them loan out your paper shares! &  SQUEEEEEEEEEEZE!!! ❤️
The premium over the spot price is going to rub people wrong.
Supposedly JP Morgan and Korea has mountains of silver.
💎🙌 BREAK THE COMEX!!!!!!
Ag majestic silver has 26 % short interest love the stonk
All we need is for Elon to twett "Silverstonks"
Oh well so much for that lol
Doesn't JP Morgan have a lot of physical?
What about Nation States?  When they can't buy Silver. will they dump dollars for Silver?
There is supply they just don’t want to sell it until they know how high it’s going to go.
I have just 10 oz I bought it for $ 300
This is a beautiful time to be alive... besides the whole virus thing. But you have to take the bad with the good. In this case because the bad caused the good.
Unpresidented 🤣🤣🤣
Excellent and informative video, thanks. I like the concept of silver being the peoples money. We live in interesting times.
to the moon
sd bullion still has silver
Great info. Really like this guy, what an expert. Sucks they can settle in paper.
Silver once again is being targeted by the Reddit crew. But it’s very different from GameStop in that it’s a much bigger market and fund managers are net long the precious metal, not short.  Lisa Abramowicz
He wrote a book called the “silver manifesto” but he doesn’t know who the silver manipulation sharks are
Pay me my silver now!
Fantastic
One day you find out you can’t withdraw your money, they will say not enough money available for you kkk
As of right now, APMEX and jmbullion are selling.
in Europe there's still stock for silver coins. Though they're getting expensive by the minute
Is this the big one? Or will silver be manipulated back into submission...again? People are very excited and I hope their excitement is justified, but I have my doubts...hope I am wrong.
Plenty of silver in Europe!! Google to find some companies. They still have stock  Censorship from youtube is preventing from writing the websites on here
I'm glad I bought 20 oz last month when spot was 25😁
Ahh gold bugs citing Jim Rickards while ignoring the fact his thesis is we get deflation first.
Let's do this !!!!!
Yea, and the price is falling again..its ridicolous to see market manipulation live-again and hear " price go up  when people buy" Ha.Ha. Thats exactly not whats happening and its fraud, RobinHood should go to jail first.
Hunts got wiped out. Same will happen with this iteration of pushing up the prices.
Stock: SLVDF , 16% owned by Eric Sprott, Silver miner,  huge silver announcement soon!! share price still low!!
Just bought another 100 ounces.
I think the bullion sellers stopped selling to see what the sunday price was going to be, they're not all out of silver imo.
JM bullion has rounds eagles and leafs
Kitco price 50 cents off for some reason.. Prob just busyness
Bought 15 oz today LETS GO!
Lol this is not wsb pushing silver, it's hedge funds. Look at the largest silver holders.
Humans are a herd animal. WSB is enough to start an avalanche and get everyone buying.
What do you believe in
U cant buy silver right now ? No way !!?!!
silver now.
If you don't bring back Goku hair. I'm just going to go back to watching Schiff.
$300.00 silver soon.
17>45<o7🇺🇸 "Trust the Plan !" 🙏🎚🗽🇺🇸⚓🐸🔱
People want real money! The supply has been tight for over a year!
Silver 🥈🥈🥈
They put a stop to the Hunt Bros cornering the market . They put a stop Buffet on gold and silver same with Soros but they cannot put a stop to the millions of stackerz! TO THE MOOOOOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀JPM will have to let it rip this time plus they are long.
This guy is a premiere interviewer.  At first, I was disappointed Kitco got rid of Daniella (or she quit) or whatever happened, but this guy kills it.
Two Davids, two class acts.
No one said Buy silver. But I like silver.
NIce to see David starting off the conversation with a laugh, silver is his glow.
4:02 that's what I want to know.
All we need is a little blood in water, the sharks will come
Clown, revolt against the hedge funds stealing from retail =  clown
Everythings empty... Also Sprott silvertrust. You can't buy it.  It's great! It's a wave and it will squeeeze.  Silver 🚀 🚀 🚀 30$ today?
If they going to change the rule why don't people stop buying contracts buy physical silver instead
Unbelievable coverage!!! 5 years Kitco fan for this moment
I'm not entirely convinced that the want to squeeze silver came from WSB, but instead is coming from one of outsiders who are drive people to silver. 5th largest holder of SLV is Citadel, so there's obviously a push to get people into silver instead of GME.
The Department of Justice, SEC and our corrupt Congress are the crux of the corruption. They spent years laying the ground work of leniency to the financial institutes you see today.
$NOK $SLV $GME
people buy physical silver less crash this Market
Mr Lin, you are fantastic!
The reddit folks are breaking Wallstreets balls. And silver is probably the best way to flip off JP Morgan and the rest of the banking cartels.
This is pumper stupidity.
You can buy silver stocks, SLV, PSLP on other exchanges just not robinhood. E*TRADE and on the uphold exchange both work.
Tomarrow al look for some Silver see who has some al never stop stacking Silver 💰📉⬆️⬆️⬆️
Let’s buy the bullet!
Silver is the most manipulated market ever. Buy silver
Trying to imagine how many worthless paper contracts are being thrown at the metals right now to try and control their rise .
SLV !!!! BUY BUY BUY !!!!!!
A broken clock is right twice a day.
Nah David. It's not  WSB. It's someone with much greater firepower.
Hello sir. Good morning.. OK..I look2 info..thanks you sir and all friend company..
Silver wont go over 35$ .
David is a good man
You can't buy it cuz it's all piled in my garage!!!! Yeah Billy!!!!
Way to cover this story David & David!
Go on silver
Plenty of silver in Australia 🇦🇺
Historic
UNOBTANIUM
