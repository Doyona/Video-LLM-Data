We are woeful right now so I’m coming back to some better games…
0:20 Seriously, they cut out his camera celebration
He’s done it again that Harry Kane
L team
Son vs holding, we are in business
Haha Holding! It all makes sense now. He still had PTSD from this.
Harry Kane needs to stop Jogging and start intercepting  the ball
As a Tottenham fan Arsenal should have won🥇
I like Arsenal
Well done Tottenham
PUT SOME RESPECT ON HARRY KANE AND SONNY THEY ARE THE BEST DUO IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE COYS
Come on you spurs
A devastating missile from the South Korean Number 7! Heung min Son is going to go down in Tottenham as one of the greatest players in the club's history. Tottenham have a special world-class player.
Son is a £150m easy
NORTH LONDON IS WHITE COYS
NORTH LONDON IS WHITE COYS
We Agumpadi pon Arsenal
Who's here after Jose got sacked
Who is here after arsenal beating sh**
I love Phil Neville's noises when he likes something - Kane's goal in this case!
I think son is really good at football, he is my fav footballer
no ones talking about how stupid leno was for the son goal. excellent strike, but should be getting saved
Turns Out They Are Gunners The Other Way
Son is easily one of the best players of all time , he is overlooked because of his race and he hasn’t been In the spotlight for as long
0:15
Beautiful goals. Son is the best player this season 🔥
‘Classic Jose Mourinho, Classic Harry Kane’ ....Great commentary
Harry Kane can’t miss from there
sonny and kane ofc brilliant but since reguilon joined spurs way better in defence
KARMA IS REAL..
Palace 4-3 cane it be so?
Arsenal are funny.  With no ozil They think they are 🔥 ...,😂😂 Man that team needs a restart bottom, ASAP
Son is the greatest Tottenham striker ever. Kane got nothing on him.  If he was british, he would have had a statue to his name by now.
Bbh
I love it when Gary Neville says “ohhhh”. It adds to the enjoyment of goal
This Kane doesn't have mercy with that leftfoot
Son is probably the best winger in the world right now
Son and Kane. they'll definitely bring spurs on top rank
Who’s stopping Son & Kane??
wocky slush
Son played well but I'll havw to give motm to fernandes
Both playing for the completely wrong team. They should be out there winning silver ware instead of staying at a dead end club like Spurs winning absolutely nothing of significance
feel sad for arsenal but chelsea tottenham and liverpool had a good chance at winning the league
Arsenal
1:19 maitland niles just stopped
Mourinho has made Son into a beast.
I know sonny’s dad smiled when he saw that goal
Son pls come to my club
The first goal was amazing
Watched in 0.25 x speed. Fascinating. ARESENAL defense in shambles.
Son has been scoring so much inside the box this season that I almost forgot how good he is shooting from distance.
So much space, so easy, Arteta is a clown
Son is world class why hasn’t anyone come in for him!!
What a goal..what a player
Amazing first goal ! I wonder how long Arteta has left with this sort of form ?
Is it weird for a fan to be happy that their team lost?
When Mourinho doesn't have the Glazers and Ed Woodward tugging at his neck with a leash.
Son is the besttt
If you think Arsenal doesn't need ozil , you have a problem.
I am from the future things brighten up for arsenal they win the championship next season
Harry's goal resembles Raul Garcia
Kane assist to son Son assist to Kane.   What a duo!
My goal was good right 😅😅😅
United should bid for Son with Martial included. Son is word class without a doubt 👏
Alhamdulilah
Arsenal are so powder puff they need a warrior in that central midfield
Not even mugging it but when was the last time aubamayang scored?
Liverpool fan but Arteta will learn from the Kane goal if your mans injured don't let him walk off before getting subbed that was ridiculous those steps Thomas made walking off then the few running back could of been vital if he stayed in position.
Don't seem like Kane's been around over a Decade! Core Blimey! 'Time Flies' eh
Aresnal were predictable and lacked creativity if only they had a world class midfielder or someone who ranks high in the assist department! Oh wait they do = Mezut Ozil!!!  What a player, he can cut a defence open with one pass, Aubs goals would tripple with Ozil in the team......Wenger believed in him!.....Why doesnt the currant manager or is it because Ozil has voiced his opinions. Eitherway, it has nothing to do with his ability....."ye but he goes missing in tough games" What??? Like every other Aresnal player!......Arsenal have battered Ozils career and seem to be doing the same with Aubs..no obe could score in that team, shocking!
If Son continues like this he will first be contender for PFA award and ballon d'or
This game deserved more than 2.49 minutes highlights! Learn something from BT sports!
Xhaka committed five chance stopping fouls before getting a card Lo Celso 2. Ref gaVE EVERYTHING TO ARSENAL AND THEY STILL LOST. Ref would have given them a penalty at the drop of a hat if he could get away with it
Arsenal have now proven themselves to be a banter Fc club, Manchester United are 10x greater
Rumour has it Anthony Yarde thinks we deserved to win this game 🤷🏾‍♂️
Wonder if the queen and Phillip will take the knee for blm live on tv
Not really the highlights if it only shows the goals
Son is something else
I'm an arsenal fan. But lol. I'm loving hearing the banter coming our way. Fair play. I want arteta to get a decent chance. Our fans our  like little girls. Dont worry. Be happy. Enjoy the game and the rollercoaster. Dont be a melt about it. Every dog has its day
I think son been listen to too much Headie one
Classic Neville goalgasm.
I live in north London, shouted in the canteen, “London is White!” And I got chased out the school by sixth formers and year 11’s lmao
SONALDOOOO
Oh how the two institutions from the early years of the Premier League have fallen from grace, competing wise. Man United have been a disaster for the past seven years since Alex Ferguson retired and as for Arsenal, when Henry, Vieira and Bergkamp left, that was when the foundations started to slowly crumble.
Funny thing  Arsenal defence
At this rate, Aubameyang is just gonna be like ozil that doesn't play football and just gets a load of cash
Harry kane and heung min son are already all time prem greats
Arsenal star players are just leeching on that money. Arsenal is so dumb with their investments. They didn't learn from Ozil. Now looks at Aubameyang. They basically throwing away money for these washed up players LOL meanwhile Son arguably best striker besides kane on the league right now, has salary one third of Ozil and half of Aubameyang... It's really a big joke.. Even Moe Salah who is the most expensive player in Liverpool which is the best team on the league only get paid 220k pounds a week, while Arsenal give Aubameyang 250k weekly and still paying Oezil 350k per week for staying at home. How dumb Arsenal boards can be 😂
If spurs win the league I will wear a man united shirt at the Liverpool stadium.
My gazillionth time to comment on this:  Kane and Son sharing an assist and goal between them yet again.  Deadliest duo.  What's the history numbers here?  Any historians?  And... The year isn't over yet.
And I was the lone voice supporting Hojbergs signing. I' also had money on spurs to win the European cup and they at least got to the final. Got money on them this season to win league city European cup. On track.
Son's goal was a screamer.
444 dislikes, Are you sure Arsenal have that many fans?😂
Come on spurs
Arsenal are shocking at the moment
😂😂😂😂😂
Kane provided Son with assist and son returned the favour🙌 those two are worldy!!
HMS ... LEGEND
Spurs are a proper side now. Mourinho has the team fighting for him. He can finish what Poch started and make them winners.
Aubameyang hasn't been the same since he started dancing after scoring a pen against United 🤣🤣
lethal
0:37 can sum1 tell me who these ppl were do they now allow fans  im rlly confused
So easy for Son, nobody goes to him, class finish though 👌
Only if city had son
"I've had enough of this ting Robbie fam......."
Partey wasn’t even injured he’s just done playing for us, can’t say I blame him 😭
Dt: I had enough wobbie 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Son and kane best strike force in the world for me and I'm a united fan.
Lacazette is a fraud
If Arsenal had won yesterday Arteta would be being called a tactical  genius for going at Tottenham away from home. It was risky and they were  undone by one brilliant moment from Son. No need to panic guys. Be  patient. Arteta needs more players next window but he has a plan. I have  full confidence in him. Fans are way too reactionary and impatient  these days. Grow some conjones. It takes some courage to handle the  sticky times while a manager experiments , builds a new team and  rebuilds attitudes etc. It takes time to become winners. Look at  Liverpool, Man Utd's struggles to re build ,  the different cycles and  many managers Chelsea have had. RELAX and enjoy the process . Trust me.
Can’t wait to watch Liverpool bodie Jose Tottenham bus
That’s why,  as I’ve been saying for over a year,  that’s why Song is the best player in the world 🌍.    Don’t give me those typical showboaters who market themselves in Europe as some kind of niche fad.  Come and play in the Premiership,  and do that against a very good Arsenal and then make your claim.....
Son is the most underrated player in Epl!!!!!
Harry Kane is just smashing records for fun
Can't believe I just saw someone try say Rashford is better then Son 😂😂😂
How long until the Arsenal fans start booing their own team?
Jose loving football again
Watching the Kane goal and looking at number 18 he just gives up..why is he not sprinting back? If he can't get to the ball I still think the fans would of appreciated the effort.
Hope Spurs dont win the league
Tottenham are playing the same type of football as Leicester when they won the league so anything is possible COYS
And they reckon spurs are after Danny Ings, would be a bad move if he left....
Wenger out they said, so wenger left, good they said. Wonder what there saying now.
honestly, arsenal need to sell auba, he will sell for so much and with that money we can buy so many quality players, the likes of Zaha and Grealish should be at Arsenal rn
loud laughing can ne heard from Broxbourne..... yes, its me
Only because Aubameyang’s bad forms after signing new contract.
Goal scored in a match:  Gary Neville: *OooOoOooOOhhhHHh* 1:24  He never disappoints 😂
What’s thing on Lenos arm? Has he just had a tattoo or summet
Spurs will do a Spurs and Spurs this season up
If Arteta's intention was to make Arsenal a worse team then he's done an excellent job. Get rid of him and get a coach that will pick Ozil.
After watching this, Arsenal is aiming to be the first big club to be in Europe League 2 and win it starting in 2021. They probably aiming for 7 or 8 positions in the premier league.
Genuinely believe Man United gonna win the league I believe in Ole's philosophy. If not then it will be Arsenal for same reason Arteta's philosophy.
'he's up against holding, he's in business'
It’s not even funny to laugh at Arsenal anymore. It’s just sad😂
I support arsenal but auba would do ma lot better at a better club like a madrid or r madrid
Son 1-0  0:11 Kane 2-0  1:18
Aubameyang ice cold
This match reminds me of that Connor McGregor and Mayweather fight lol. Tottenham just soaking all the pressure because they know arsenal ain't going to do sh*t lool
Son is legend!
If your team could pick only one of Son or Kane. Who you having? Like for Son  Comment for Kane
Cheeper tickets in the championship . Good news for Arsenal fans
Arteta In
As a Spurs Fan this is a very satisfactory and enjoyable result.....!
Kane is nothing without son
No surprise with this result Spurs are a bigger and better club
I don’t think arsenal were bad, the goals were just really good, specially from Son
spurs are the best guys if your a arsenal fan you suck
Son deserves better
Obviously didn't show Kane's awful undercut on Gabriel. He's done that at least three times this season and usually wins a foul from it. He could break their necks. Disgraceful
Arsenal finally being exposed for the team they really are, sooner the fans realise they are a mediocre club the better
Coming from a Liverpool fan I think son is one of the best attackers right now
Bale is probably looking at son from the benching think I used to do that from the right wing 😳
The swift bag mathematically advise because equipment infrequently spot concerning a raspy bat. well-groomed, super quill
How long before it will be Arteta out? I know a lot of the players he has are dismal but this is the worst Arsenal have been, all that possession and no idea. Was painful to watch and I’m not even an Arsenal fan.
Spurs is the best team in the world
Deluded Gooners thought they would be in the mix this year lol.Can't blame Wenger anymore !
Spurs is a 2 man team with a good keeper
Will arsenal be relegated this season ❓🤷🏽‍♂️..should the manager be fired🤔
Aubama who? aubama where? Aubama what?   No that’s just it....
Honestly I think Kane and Son should get married how well they link up, they’re gonna be bonded for life
They need ozil
Jose mourinho is just a special one
Villa fan here. Son is definitely your star player - I rate him more than Kane! Excellent player!
Why are Arsenal so bad now ? Same Old Arsenal now they are 15th From Invincibles to 15th FC not good enough Arteta needs to do better otherwise he could be sacked if Arsenal keep losing like this I feel sorry for Arsenal and now Tottenham the top of the Premier League I just don’t want Tottenham to win the league hopefully not
I don't mind spurs at the top because spurs will do a spurs
I love the fact that son isn't just in the spurs side for the Asian Market
What a goal by Son!
I think that anyone who played fut champs won’t be disappointed with their rewards this week
Heung min son has defected to north korea and is firing missiles all over north london 🚀💣
Arteta wanted the ball in his own box
Well done Spurs, im off 2 laugh at those fools on aftv now
Those were spurs only two chances. The  highlights make it look like Tottenham bossed the game.
Cracking goals 😃
Son is incredible, what a strike. This guy is world class and it's not debatable
Holding is terrible
Ludicrous display.
Leno is dead
Yes Spurs♥️👌
Arsenal going down becoming more realistic every passing week
Mate hands down Tottenham just buried the options that came their way... Simples. Great game for Tottenham... That where the credit goes to 👍🏾👍🏾😏
At this rate Kane may actually come close to Thierry’s record 24/20...also if he were to score 15 goals a season up until his 35th birthday he would have beat Shearer’s record by 10..could Harry be the goat? 🤔
the second goal tho who is that not running back at the bottom left lmaoo
This shows how well Tottenham performing without dele alli.
Loooool, arsenal fans hold that L
I legit predicted spurs to win on an Oh my Goal post
All time record goal scorer in the North london derbys mad coming from a bloody one season wonder 🙄
Sonincredible
Son is insane
sometimes i think son and kane assist eachother on purpose there the only people who score and assist😂
You man keep bragging about a fa cup...the takeover is here baby!
Son scores a screamer  Commentator: ehhhh   Kane blasts it in the near post from 4 yards Commentator: Genius 😂
I will never get bored of seeing that Son goal, and the second goal was just as good, fans need to get off Aurier's back, what a transformation and top quality defending yet again, he was the main part of the build up to that second goal. Aubamiyang is still in his pocket, quality performance just like against City I guess Arteta never got advice from Pep on how to deal with Jose, aka the Dinosaur. 😀
It's official Leicester have taken that top 6 title from arsenal
Arsenal sweating on Brighton result, they could drop to 16th
Son is the best player in the league by far. not even a spurs fan
whatever you think of Ozil we need him, why. -Wilshire CM/CAM. GONE Cazorla  CM/CAM. GONE Ramsey CM/CAM. GONE Ozil at home every week, disastrous. Willock on a football level not upto Ozil /  any of their standards. Ceballos- good at abit if everything,  specialist in what? Emile Smith rowe - needs a run in the hole by default these times.    still trying to replace the dude. this is why the Ozil cycle continues.
Tierney looks like the only decent Arsenal player right now...
This is the season where Spurs win a trophy hopefully, they deserve it :)
WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS PARTEY THING, ARTERA KNOWS CLEARLY HE WASN'T FIT FOR THIS GAME, THREW HIM IN AND NOW WE HAVE HIM INJURED AGAIN. IF YOU DONT INVEST HEAVY IN THE SUMMER WITH THE PLAYERS YOU NEED AND CAN TRUST THEN THIS IS YOUR DOWNFALL. YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN TAKE THE JOB IF THE BOARD ARE NOT GOING TO BACK YOUR VISION AND CHOICE OF PLAYERS. THERE IS MAJOR SURGERY NEEDED FROM THE TOP DOWN AT THIS CLUB. ARSENAL MOST LIKELY WILL DROP POINTS, SACK ARTETA AND HOPE FOR SOMEONE TO SAVE THEM IN A RELAGATION BATTLE THIS SEASON. ITS TOO MUCH FOR THESE PLAYERS AND CLUB THIS SEASON. THE TIGHT GAMES AND FIXTURES WON'T BE IDEAL WHEN WE DON'T HAVE DEPTH IN OUR SQUAD. A FEW MORE INJURIES AND WE ARE DONE FOR IF WE AREN'T ALREADY.
GoodEbening
bloody hell this arse is getting a bigger pounding this year than Elton john....
F ARSENAL 🤣😂
Arteta gotta Go
Classic José Mourinho & Classic Harry Kane
It’s lucky for spurs when the year ends in 1.....
Best couch! the Special one is back!
Son is world class
I support Liverpool so I don’t see as much of Spurs as Spurs supporters but Son, from an outsider looking in, is your best player.  Some of Kane’s passing is phenomenal though.  Great win!
I will say that Son and Kane are remarkable this season, let’s see if they can keep them tempo. From an LFC fan
Can Spurs win the league? Yes
Farce-nal......  Such an embarrassment, I'm surprised Arteta is not sacked yet
Son a world class player
Son just WOW
Shouldn't worry Arsenal fans, the football comes second now to the knee bending bullshit.
Auba went from no look goals to "look, no goals"
Son is so hard working and tracking back deep. The second goal happened as Son was too tired to track back and team mate got the ball back and deadly counter by him and Kane. Sometimes I feel like Son did too much defence and tracked back too deep when counter was on he got a long way to run to attack. under Jose, Son only got no more than three shooting chance averagely and he still could offer this stay which is amazing, if he was in an attacking team like Bayern Munich or Barcelona he would be deadly
Kane and son out here looking like a prime yorke cole combo
Just analyze Bellerin for those two goals conceded. Disgrace to compare it to school boy defending
Goal of the month that. SONALDO!
Sell auba hes lost his hunger happens every time someone goes to arsenal they do good at first then they're not motivated look at partey get dembele from lyon but I think its just arsenal as a club
Arsenal are embarrassing so far
arsenal fan pov:  we need a rebuild but the positions or what we need first is this a solid centre back who's a leader and sets an example  we need to fresh in up the attack aubameyang is playing poor as well as lacazette we need someone new who has proven them self like zaha we need thomas partey back and a new experienced manager
You’ll be fine Arsenal, don’t fret. Most teams only need 40 points to stay up
Son is spectacular but somehow he’s a humble servant and side-note to Kane no matter what he does
Let me die if spurs win the league this year 🤦‍♂️
Why is Leno playing with a bandaged arm...
Son is unbelievable and doesn’t get enough probs from these pundits who keep going on about Harry Kane
That was a low energy ooo for the 2nd goal
The ball was in the spurs box. 10 seconds later it was in the arsenal net.
Son performance is Incredible,💯👏 He is always there when the team needed, & Kane👍 as well both My favourite Player, Hope they achieve something this year.
bellerin is trash. ball watches the whole time and lets son  through. Also constant throw ins
My fav part of the match is when partey is getting shuved to get back on the pitch when he cant even run 5 metres 😂 what a joke of a club
son what a finish man! world class
People are joking we should 'have enough' to stay up. As an Arsenal fan I'm not seeing it. Worse than George Graham's last season. When we get ahead we play quite well, but when behind we have no clue what to do.
COYS❤💪
Saw on AFTV someone said Auba has been as useful as Anne Frank’s drum set
Mourinho is an absolute genius
Next stop AFTV
From a Man Utd fan: Unlikely we will win it this year, hopefully Spurs win the title. Good job on destroying ARSEnal, their fans talk the most crap. "Arteta is going to get us back to the top, Arteta has tactics and Ole doesn't"  Its December and you are sitting 15th on the table
Aftv is an absolute joke, dt blamed bellerin for the second goal because he misplace his pass but the other player lost balence and it wasn’t his fault. It just shows that they refuse to blame the real issue like aubameyang not performing because he interacts on social media. Man Utd’s player of the season last year Anthony martial has had just as bad a season so far as aubameyang, arsenals player of the year. Yet martial is getting 10x more hate than aubameyang. Just shows how idiotic arsenal fans are.
Ya
Arsenil got seriously Tottenhammered ⚒
Aubamayang is definitely regretting the decision to sign a new contract
Heuniano Sonaldo
Joses insane counter attacks just took arsenal to the championship.
Big six pointer game for Arsenal next week against Burnley, whoever wins that game might have a chance of staying up.
Why are there people in the crowd not wearing face masks? Wtf?
Have to lol at the spuds fans actually thinking they're gonna win something idiots like I told the one fan j know let me know when you win the league that was about 4 years ago I haven't heard from him since small club probably dont even have a trophy room NO NEED
Time is up for arteta .
"Wenger Back"
"He's against Holding then he's in business"! 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Xhaka: No one can commit worst fouls than me.  Bellerin: Hold my throw.
Son scores from 35 yards out top corner Martin Tyler: “ son shoots,........ and scores”
willian would’ve been better off at a Serie a club
A lot of people slating Auba in these comments, yet no one is looking at the reason he can't perform, no one passes to him. As an Arsenal fan, Auba deserves better delivery and we deserve to strip out the midfield and back line.
Anyone have any idea what is going on with Ozil?
Imagine Hector Bellerin has more foul throws this season than aubameyang has goals.
Champions this year. We will pull away from the pack after Christmas games
Sons goal was beautiful but kane goal was disgusting that finishing (United fan)
Bellarins throws are worse than manes trim  no cap
one of the first times i wanted arsenal to win as a chelsea fan and they bottled it
Arteta should not be manager. He picks Bellerin over AMN, he picks Xhaka instead of Ceballos or El Neney, he picks Willian instead of Pepe or Nelson.  He's not the man for the job- we have no goals from open play, we lack creativity, we create nothing. The sooner Arteta leaves the better.
Good team Arsenal. 😂
Kane is a Pimp......most dude too score vs Arsenal in Derbys haha
Easy game for spurs, Arsenal was rubbish ...
They gave Auba a new contract and all of a sudden he's missing clear chances. What a fraud.
Jesus this week's goal of the week is gonna be interesting some absolute bangers son is different gravy
It  would be a disaster for the prem if a team that parks the bus at home wins the prem....30% possession at home is so negative but that's Mourinho's style....boring n dated....he could never manage lpool or city playin like that....as it happens a team that plays Thursday nights in the losers jug has never won the prem...and never will
A wise man once said... "IT'S TIME TO GOOO"
its amazing how hector does not go into the pocked for space to block son but continues to run and slips when son pulls it back sums up arsenal right now
Most predictable game of the season this, arsenal didn’t have one singular hope of winning this(don’t support either team)
Arsenal is good team, they probably won't relegate this season
Harry Kane is on track to break Thierry Henrys assist record, Alan Shearers premier league goal record and Wayne Rooneys England goal record. What a player!
That first goal though !! 😅😮
I was shocked when poch was sacked, but what a masterstroke by levy bringing in mourinho,, coys,
Spurs are my favourites for the title but I would also say liverpool could be dangerous. Spurs have played the best football, got the best players based on form and have had most of the decisions go their way. Liverpool on the other hand have had tough champions league games, 80% of the squad is missing, had major decisions go against them and havent been in the best form. Yet both spurs and liverpool are level. If Spurs hit a rough patch and liverpool are able to bring in a cb in January, spurs could be in trouble. Like I cant see spurs going up another level or their players getting better. Liverpool have barely got out of 2nd gear
Park the bus fc
How many times have we beaten Arsenal this year
Was going to ask who the number 18 who stopped tracking back for 2nd goal was - injured Partey.  Fantastic finishes from spurs for both goals though
I don't what arsenal fans are angry about cos man city lost to spurs. Be happy u haven't got destroyed 😂😂
Can in just point out what a disgusting manager Arteta is. First he puts Luiz at risk last week by not subbing him straight away after his head injury then he pushes an injured Partey back on the field when Spurs were attacking for their second goal. Horrible human being.
Tottenham look really exciting this season. Enjoy watching them, from a palace fan
The Tottenham board made a  much smarter braver managerial decision than arsenal in appointing mourinoh.  Even building the stadium they took a better loan unlike arsenal who had higher interest rate and struggled for years to buy players.  So Tottenham have a smarter board give credit where its due
Son and Kane are just unstoppable
After Spurs lost to Everton in the first game of the season an Arsenal fan said that Mourinho had made Spurs into the next West Ham in the comments. How the tables have turned.
Arsenal defence is 💩 And willian ruined his career from moving to arsenal
Son and kane partnership is scary. When they both in form probably the scariest duo in top 5 europe imo.
If you buy into Jose's way of thinking us against the world he'll win you trophies United players didn't believe in him enough
U just know auba regrets signing a new contract 😂
1:46 arteta to Thomas 😂😂
2-0... Ah, Arsenal, you're useless...  Sincerely, a Chelsea supporter.
Easy win today, we just need to beat Liverpool and Leicester in up coming games
Well done arteta, 15th with this team is actually quite decent imagine if he made top 10 !
harry kane is the most overrated player of all time son does all the work
"Why did you let them do that?!"
Ooh  GOD
Arsenal are in the mud
Arsenal just don't seem to have any stand out players in their squad this season, auba and Willian have done it in the past but right now, neither are performing. A very mediocre looking squad tbh.
When you cut in and hit finesse for the right amount of time on FIFA 0:29
Arsenal need to resign giroud he a lot better at finishing and getting on the end of crosses than laccazet and aubamyang
Despite this result,Arsenal still won more trophies in the last couple of months then Tottenham in the last couple of years . ○_○
"Ooohhhhwwwwhhh" - Gary Neville
All Son and Kane together, lose one to injury and watch Spur's season disintegrate.
Out: lacazette, willian, kolasinac, sokratis, mustafi, holding,   In: szoboszlai, aouar, isco, coutinho, mittlestadt, decent rb and decent cb.
Liverpool or Spurs for 2020/21 win?
Nice to see arsenal playing in the championship next year and getting relegated in the championship so the next year their in league one then league Two and non league 😂
Sonaldo
Come on you spurs
Now the haters can say bad things against Mou.
Let’s goooo
JOSE MOURINHO OLD STYLE OF FOOTBALL IS BACKKK!!!!! 💪🏾💪🏾
Harry Kane is unbelievable what a player.
Fun fact: arsenal are a proffesional football club
Tottenham wanted it more. With every sprint.
ballerina is responsible for both goals, if he doesn't play mourinho can't park the bus and its a completely different game
SONNNN
Kane and Son Are The Best Duo in the pl
Wonderful Strike From Son🌟
I think the tottenham vs liverpool game is gonna be a end to end counter fest  as both sides do that and not wanting to sound over confident  but i think liverpool  will be so used to be the team to score from the counter  when spurs park the bus  its gonna take them out there comfort zone ...will be a interesting  watch
As a spurs fan i must say that son is the best player in the world and we're gonna win the league
Mourinho to Arteta: You keep the ball, I keep the 3 points.   I sink it's a fair deal.
Wow son just wow
If Liverpool don’t win the league this season I’d love to see Spurs win it. Mourinho winning the title with Spurs after United and Chelsea sacked him would just be hilarious
Arsenal are a championship club at best. Lucky to even be in the prem
Wenger out!
Arsenal fans have to admit they are just a mid table club now
Spurs will be up there come the end of the season. Big question is how will they get on if son or kane get injured
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 same old Arsenal. Give it a few more losses before they start blaming the board and the owner.
Son player or the season, I’m calling it now. His price is going up after this season
Son is the GOAT
Bruh i'd love Son at Liverpool if any of the front three leave he's the man for me.
as things currently stand Arsenal are a useless team and have been and will be for a while.  They're just not serious.
Arteta an idiot why did he do a change during an spurs counter attack. This just show how bad arteta is.
Too short
Akinfenwa be training for Wycombe's fixture against arsenal next season as we speak....
Meanwhile..  Arsenal fans... “trust the process”
"I've been saying it for years blud Arteta needs to go he's trash blud he can't even get us a win he needs to go fam"
Good ebening
🤢🤢🤢🤢
ahahahahahaha arsenal r so bad
The fact that benteke has the Same Amount of goals as aubameyang is mad
The whole point of allowing fans back in the stadiums is if they obey the rules and wear a face mask or covering. I have seen in some of these highlights from all the games a lot of people not wearing anything on their face. The cases are gonna go back up again and football will be behind closed doors again. Disgraceful behaviour from the individuals
Arsenal play like that old TV show called the Renford Rejects
SON SHOULD JOIN LIVERPOOL
Arsenal are in trouble .
Bruv.. all I know is pain...I'm tired, I dont even know why I watched these "highlights"
Watched this live, arsenal completely dominated but they couldn’t create a damn thing it was frustrating to watch I can’t even imagine what it’s like as a fan!   Aubamayang is looking old af
The transfer strategy of Arsenal is not designed to build a team. Pepe is worth £30m, no more. He has no presence. Then there's Saliba this is a total fiasco reportedly brilliant but can't make first team. Joke. Auba has done an Ozil,  drag it out then sign a lucrative contract. He's peaked should have signed a new player. I can't fault our youngsters but they have no inspirational player. We are now a low confidence team. I'm too busy trying to make sure my family and I get through this pandemic to be concerned about overpriced and overpaid players. The fans should wake up. Willian the, Xhaka. Bellerin, Louis, Mustafa, Pepe, Lacazette not up to standard, sell them and build a new team around the hungry young players. We deserve to be where we are because we are not good enough and maybe Arteta is not up to the job.
Remember when arsenal fans were gassed over beating united! Who’s laughing now 🤣
Spurs can win it this season. Kane-Son is almost telepathic.
I believe that this summarises Jose's methods: Just like one portuguese coach (Jorge Simão) said, one day, about beautiful and pragmatic football: I'm at a pub and I start chatting with this gorgeous girl. We spend hours talking to each other, she laughs, I laugh, and both of us are having a great time. Then, there comes a guy, who we will call José. With just 4 or 5 words, José takes the girl home. In the end, you know who won, don't you?  Moral of the story, it doesn't matter if you play dull football, at the end of the day results matter. People need stop criticising Mourhino methods!
Coys
mind the gap.
What they won’t show is how battered they were in the second half tho
Goodbye 👋 arteta
Coys
Arsenal DIED the day Kroenke became the owner, something that the fans have yet to realise. Maybe when the funeral (relegation) takes place, they'll wake up to reality, but it'll be too little too late.
is Kane's son playing with Spurs now too?
Kane - Son duo is elite
North London ⚪️🔵⚪️🔵⚪️🔵⚪️🔵🔵⚪️🔵⚪️🔵⚪️🔵⚪️🔵⚪️⚪️
We are sure that's not unai emery in disguise as artea cause I ain't seen no chances
Everybody gangsta until aurier figures out how to defend
Arsenal are just lol
That pass from Aurier out of defence in the build up to Kane’s goal 👍
If Arsenal are going to move to a 4 at the back then Bellerin cannot play because defensively he is shocking
Sons player of the month better get a winter upgrade😂
I've said this and I'll say it again, Leno is not a good keeper, yes he's a good shot stopper from close but he's positioning is woeful. Martinez is the better option.
How can Arsenal just allow Son & Kane so much time & space.....unbelievable.....🙄
RIP DT's wife 😔
Wenger back
What a goal by son tho
No ozil glad to see arsenal getting smashed apart !!!!! Good job Tottenham
You can watch highlights of all this season's Premier League games right here! ► http://bit.ly/SkySportsPLHighlights2021
Everyone is slamming bellerin but if auba had been where he'd passed he'd have scored, whereas if bellerin had crossed to where auba was either a defender or lloris would have got to it easily.
I think Spurs should join the French League. LOL.
Partey be like where's the party I joined for
Where are all Arsenal fans who were so desperate to get rid of Arsene Wenger?
Son is the greatest asian player of all time
This team's turning into a joke....wonder what ozil must be thinking
Well done spurs! Arsenal looked dangerous but didnt score....not a mistak liverpool will make...spurs need to work on that defence, they need to be more physical, an not let forwards run and jump all over them...get stuck in!!
Sonaldo & Kane Duo this season 🔥
Bye C ya next week wen Arsenal lose to Burnley 2-0 even tho they r a t home
The morinho effect .
It’s getting too funny😂😂😂
son needs to be apart of team of the year or ballon dor contender
Lol Arsenal is soooobad😂😂😂
I smell regulation 😤
Worse than Sheffield U West Brom Fulham Burnley
Mikel Emery.
Banter FC at it again
Awful Arsenal
That Arsenal Bench is terrible. No one to bring on to make any impact
Banter Fc. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Im going to miss these games after Arsenal are relegated.............hopefully draw them in a cup :)
Lovely to see a crowd
Imagine if arsenal go down☺️😅
IT'S TIME TO GO!
0:16 Lethal. 🔥⚽️🔥
WE'RE GOING TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP  WE'RE GOING TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP  WE'RE GOING TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP!!!
Don’t get carried away there a lot commentating with short memories. Spurs win yes I’m delighted  however what was lacking in this game was the sharpness and hunger Chelsea are playing with at the  minute Coys
Son - how every player should strive to be like.
As a united fan who cussed jose, i gotta say this spurs team seems tailor made for him. Reminds me of his time at Porto. 8 solid, disciplined players, and a couple of world class match winners up top. Hojberg is areal unsung hero
Why did Bellerin end up on his backside @ 0:29? Hardly a vicious cut inside by Son, was it?
Who's getting sacked in the morning
Nobody gonna talk about how mad sons goal was wat a goal!
That’s what happens when you continue to leave out Ozil! They need a play maker to bring it all together!
It is hard for small clubs to keep up with those at the top.
Arteta's at the wheel man, he’s doing his thing, the gunners are back.” - Arsenal fans after Europa league   FUKHSAKE WOBBIE WHEN WILL IT END 🤬💦 -  After facing premier league teams
Move over bale there's a new son here
Reckon arsenal are title contenders for the championship next year
Liverpool fan but son is playing class football this season all round amazing player🙌
love that kane finish
Huge mistake to let go Martinez , Leno is a joke.
Son scares me
Who else knew Tottenham were gonna win and was just waiting for this?
AFTV is gonna look like a riot
Arsenal will be battling relegation with Sheffield hahahahha
SON IS WORLD CLASS
Son what a GOAL! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Jamie Redknapp sounded all game like a man who'd put his money on Arsenal and was fuming that they'd let him down
Arsenal keeper is terrible. Got beat from 30 yards then got beat at his near post
Arsenal bottled it again. Can't cross, can't shoot from outside of the box, can't do anything right. Arteta out, that's my Christmas wish!
This team don't play for the badge
Live chat?
Shearer’s record looks in sight
Fun fact: zouma got more goal than auba n lacazette😂
Worst arsenal team i ever seen . A bloke in charge who never managed before  too. 1 decent player in Tierney,  the rest are championship standard apart from David Luiz who is conference  standard
Arsenal haven’t scored an open play goal since the 4th October, that was 2 whole months ago🤣🤣🤣🤣
If Tottenham wins the premier league this year, i will say good bye to football specially Arsenal
Ah, off to AFTV for a good laugh
Wenger In
*One team very on form today, the other very off colour*
Lloris has been so under the radar this season. Man city, Chelsea and arsenal back-to-back and not a goal conceded
Best game ever😅
Amazon Prime saved Jose's career
Get rid of this spanish exchange student ASAP and bring in Poch I beg.
I have to say this is the worst Arsenal team that I've ever watched,  and this is the best Spurs team I've ever seen.        Yet this Arsenal team has still won more trophies 🤣
Who knew son could morph into ronaldo
Even stevie wonder could see that arsenal was never gonna win this match😭💀
So it was this or the Formula 1...OBVIOUSLY i watched the F1 which was way more interesting. This Arsenal side are useless and have been for years. I cannot be asked to watch them anymore, its painful, its frustrating and still nothings improved. We paid a fortune for Pepe and the fella shows moments of good which isnt good enough, Laca...No better than Walcott whenever he chose he wanted to be on form for 2 weeks when he was still at the club. We still have Mustafi....WHY O WHY!? I caught Arsenal v Man Utd from 2002 the other night on Sky Sports Replay; damn that Gunners team was dope! This lot........Naaa; F1 will do me fine lads. Well done Spurs (DID I ACTUALLY JUST SAY THAT!?!?!?!) The team needs ripping up and starting again ideally but we know thats never gonna happen but we have way too many arrogant snapchat slutts in this club, im sick of it.
It’s so weird to see the fan reactions in replays now
The front two for Spurs are the best in world football at the moment.
I hear Arsene Wenger is available. Arsenal Should probably look to bring him in.
Arsenal are a shambles!  But I must say that to see fans with no mask's is concerning, I personally wouldn't have admitted them into the ground.
Tottenham have dominated Arsenal for a good few years now
Bellerin is a wet loo roll excuse of a player.
You know it’s bad when we have to worry being below Sheffield 😂
I see no other team winning the pl this season than the hotspurs...::
Harry Kane is a truly brilliant footballer
Willian: I joined Arsenal to win trophies Chelsea fans: Dying of laughter.
At least Arsenal try to play football. Spurs are an ugly, ugly team to watch.
Terrible defending the end of the half just keep it at 1-0, or be in a 2 v 4 , concede and secure the loss, stupid!
Mad goal from Son
Wtf is actually looks so strange to see fans at a football match
When you have to scroll down to see Arsenal in the table🤣
Arteta out
Most of us wanted rid of Wenger for getting 4th everytime. Now we cant even get 5th.
BACK WHERE WE BELONG, IP TOP
COME ON YOU SPURS
I really hope son will stay to play for Spurs for another few years. He’s so talented and the best player in the league right now. No questions
Son looking class wearing the old Adidas f50s
son of a gun
The defensive work rate of arsenal on the second goal was plain useless.
That Son goal is insanely good yet the commentary is awful for it. As if its a normal goal.  A world class goal by a world class player in a derby to keep them top of the league, one that will be watched for years and yet the commentary ruins it for me.
Kane will claim that assist.
0:16 LMAO HAHAHA bellerin lol, how do these spastics steal a living? useless footballers int he premier league baffles me sometimes.
Ffs!
Imagine supportin arsenal
Son and Kane are such an amazing duo. P.s I'm a United fan
Meanwhile: DT predicted 4-2 to arsenal. Don’t be like DT.
What a win for us vs arsenal
even a one day old kid clearly sees the team needs a creative midfielder like Ozil but surprisingly Arteta doesn't see that
Can't wait to see Arsenal vs Derby County next season
As an arsenal fan I can honestly say that spurs outclassed us in every position! We played into their trap. The difference from us to them is clearly visible. Son is top 5 best players in the world along with Jane arguably being one of the best strikers in the world. That strike force is lethal and hard to stop. Simple.
2020 Banter Club Championship winner: Arsenal 2019 Banter Club Championship Winner: Arsenal 2018 Banter Club Championship winner: Arsenal 2017 Banter Club Championship winner: Arsenal 2016 Banter Club Championship winner: Arsenal
Nice one my son
Clubs too busy about being LGBT friendly than caring about the team and their success, championship next season boys
Arsenal FC is OVER
Arteta is the failure of La Masia and and embarrassment to Pep Guardiola. Tito Vilanova who sadly passed away, Luis Enrique all worked under Pep and they learnt a lot under him. Arteta should be ashamed.
Subscribe to my channel if Son is a world class player
Son might be the best player in the Premier league from a city fan. It is a tough debate between him and kdb
Partey.... what *arsenal fans go quiet*
If your a gooner......i hate you!
I don't get why people are mocking arsenal, they are just safe distancing themselves from the rest of the league.
Son > Neymar
Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur and the SPURS go marching on.
Bring back OZIL
Tierney really is Arsenal's only good player at the moment
As a Liverpool fan, i have to say Spurs are actually killing it. Son and Kans are just wow.
Arsenal are a proper banter club. Fans earlier in the season telling me he’s the brightest young manager around. Lampard is a shambles blah blah blah. Now they’re calling for his head. Embarrassing fans, embarrassing club.
Jamie Redknapp I don’t think you understand the Mourinho way of football winning is everything the result is all that matters and as long as all the players believe in his way they may win something  I hope they do   Good luck Jose
Not a Spurs fan but that Duo is meant to be. So great together
That was a David Hopkin type goal
From my view it’s either Chelsea, Tottenham Liverpool or Leicester winning this league I doubt any other team stands a chance now
Arsenal need to replace Arteta as soon as possible otherwise they could be sucked into a tough battle to avoid relegation.
Son is some player. Pure Quality.
The commentary seriously doesn't do Son's goal justice, especially as it was in a derby
👖⬇️
Always that the fans wishing their best ever manager to be sacked was a terrible idea.
Arsenal got what they deserved... A bollocking
Son has been world class for years . Might be the best player in the prem rn
COME ON YOU SPURS
Sky sports must have deleted my previous comments, the truth hurts! English commentators are bias! 😂
Arsenal fans so happy a month go. When  Abumyang sign Arsenal fans thought about title challenge. Arsenal don't creat enough chances for all there ball possession
There was only gonna be 1 winner
Arsenal.     hahaha 😂
Son is incredible, what a player
Leno is our downfall at the minute
This a classic Mourinho masterclass. This will win him title or any other cups. That's guaranteed.
Ty: we lost because our players thought we were still in lockdown
1:46 Mourinho looks at the watch, counting how long will this counter attacks takes until Spurs scores...9 seconds (ok?:P)...I sink its good enough
what a way to promote Unisport's new boots lmao
Partey to simone: Am sorry i want to back to Atletico madrid.
Arsenal could be relegated 😂😂😂😂😂
So Arsenal are not doing to well, Jose working his magic, Spurs fans thrilled,  but wait, ye haven't won anything yet, yet trophy cabinet has cobwebs on it, now ye cud very well win the PL this season, I doubt it but who knows?? Now Arsenal are pretty bad at the moment, they need to clean out the rubbish and add some class, I think 3 players might do it if they buy wisely, Arteta shud never have took that job, he left the club as a legend, he came back as a saviour and unless hes a magician he'll leave as a villain, not a legacy he or Arsenal fans want, theres a lot of football to be played yet, theres no way Arsenal can win or even dream about the top 4 and if Spurs lose Kane or Son ye will struggle, Liverpool will win the PL again this season, so enjoy ur win today ye thoroughly deserved it and dont advertise for a trophy cabinet cleaner yet, he or she wont be needed.
Literally becoming a series of Kane assist son and son assist Kane. And it’s great to see from a qpr fan 👍🏼
Kane is so good at that, taking the shot slightly before you expect him to
As a Man United fans, I'd take Son and Kane for Rashford and Martial all day no question.
I'm done being an arsenal fan legit I'm done, I'm now a Chelsea fan because at this point I know they won't give me grey hairs like these twats.
Spurs won’t go far believe me at the moment any team can beat arsenal
Yano whats hilarious kane got a assist for the first goal 🤣🤣🤣
Kane and Son will definitely be up there with the best Premier League striker partnerships for sure
Arsenal 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hey Gunners 👋...RELEGATION is coming "SOON"🤣🤣🤣
Son would start in pretty much any team in the world. In one of those attacking positions. Even in Liverpool and PSG he'd start as the central attacking player. Bayern he'd start over Sane and Coman too.
Classic Harry kane. What a goal ⚽
arsenal relegation party free admission
Waiting for AFTV now
Arsenal lost but the got the record for assists by a ref today
I swear Kane breaks a record every game
I'm so sick of this, I've been an Arsenal fan since the day I was born! But being an Arsenal fan making me hate football, none of these players deserve to wear the shirt. All but like five of our players are an absolute disgrace.
1:40 What was Partey doing?
Aubameyang shouldn’t be our captain he isn’t commanding, he isn’t loud and he simply doesn’t care it just because he is our best player on paper.
I never thought one day I would want spurs to win the league it’s the Jose affect.
Can’t wait to watch Arsenal Fan TV 🤣🤣🤣
Disgusted!!!
Aubameyang just took the money and ran 😂🤣
I am just waiting for arsenal TV 📺 moaning 😂 😂
coys
Sweet ping off the bar from Kane's shot.
AFTV n Chill anyone?
we only lost because it wasn't Thursday
Son scores an absolute world class goal and all Martin Tyler can do is slightly raise the tone of his voice ffs
The ‘Arteta out’ banners will be up soon
Arsenal Arsenal 🔨🔨🔨
Arsenal  trash fans and trash owner who didn't appreciate or give enough support during his latter tenure
Arsenal fans have been absolute twats for years now completeley blind they stumble into mediocrity that weve had for almost half a lifetime.......COYS
Man City 0 Chelsea 0 Arse nil
Why is there no one saying... "Arteta out" ?  Are Arsenal fans happy with all this? Or just got used to weekly humiliation?
Same all Arsenal 😭😭😭😭😂😂😂🤣
Don't get carried away Spurs fans. You've still got the big teams to play
I'm not quite sure why the amateur female player was in there with Souness, but the coverage was a bit lackluster due to the Manchester United inspired piped crowd noise (experienced this first hand at Old Trafford in past seasons), the fans' response felt muted to the viewer, and their distain to players paid over £100k a week taking the knee like idiots over equality. What they want, over £200k a week like.... oh hang on that doesn't work the narrative does it. Shame on Sky and the FA for prolonging this far left extremist narrative.
1000th comment lol
Tottenham have to be the most boring team to watch! Can’t wait until they bottle it and Liverpool win the league again.
Are Arsenal fans still proud of their "Wenger out" moments? XD
IT'S TIME TO GOOO !!!!!
unpopular opinion: son is better than kane
Arsensk are straight garbage there trash wth is wrong with them jose played the Mayweather law
A lot of comments talking about how Arsenal played the better football, how Spurs were 'lucky' etc. Spurs set up this way. This is how they want other teams to play. They are organised to deal with whatever teams throw against them and have the sheer quality to score on the counter after teams over commit in attack. Arsenal had lots of the ball today because Tottenham allowed them to have it. Night and day between the two clubs.
I’m no spurs hater or anything but i don’t think spurs will win the league because Chelsea and Liverpool have proven themselves that they can win the pl but spurs have so far proven they can be title contenders no hate or anything but I just don’t genuinely think they can win it this season but who knows with Jose Mourhino they might
King Kane!!!!
Arsenal will go down with west brom
Arsenal will always be BANTER FC
Who is better like son reply kane
Ty: We lost the game because there were only spurs fans in the stadium
ً the depression builds....
Great match for the Spurs supporters
Auba has more hairstyles than goals this season...
The Spanish Steve Bruce strikes again 😂 gotta love cockney Newcastle or (Arsenal) as they tend to get called. Can’t wait to see them finish in the bottom half!
Arsenal are so bad we need to scrap our defence and get rid of some midfielders. Coming from an arsenal fan
This is depressing and I’m not even an arsenal fan, I feel sorry for them now damn...
Incredible understanding between son and kane. best duo in the premier league this season by far.
Son will be going to Barcelona
Surely kane cant go down as one off the greatest who never won a title...
Mourinho let Arsenal have the ball and just parked the bus knowing they would be wide open in the transition 😂. Kane and Son are carrying this Spurs attack.
Wow son is outhere scoring fifa goals
"Mourinho is finished" - said by 1000+ idiots in the last 12 months
Son is class and a diver, basically Neymar but better soon come
Arsenal are not a top club anymore, they were a while ago, and their invincibles team is legendary, but they haven't challenged for a top trophy in 10 years. City, Liverpool and Chelsea all have recent league titles and European trophies, Spurs are top of the league and made it to the CL final a year ago, and even United manage to pull off an occasional big win against one of the big European boys, Arsenal do not pull their weight for the title of 'big club'.
Can already hear the gooners over at Arsenal fan TV
Thanks arsenal thanks a lot
Just when everyone thought Mourinho was a washed up manager nobody wanted to employ anymore he transforms Spurs into serious title contenders
Idec what anyone says son is world class and one of the best players in the prem
Mourinho before Kickoff. "Boys, its Arsenal"
Dont get too excited they hand out the trophies at the end of the season
dts wife better get packing
Yet people still have ways to criticise Tottenham... what don’t they get 😂coys
Son is world class from utd fan
I feel bad for Tierney he's actually a really good player getting dragged down by being in that terrible Arsenal side.
Son might become the greatest Asian player of all time. Absolutely lethal
son and kane dangerous
Watching arsenal is like watching the titanic you know its gonna sink but you keep on watching 😔
arsenal has to be the worse team i’ve seen in years
Banter Fc loose again 😂
Willian should’ve stayed at chelsea
SONALDOOOOOO
I honestly don’t know what difference sacking arteta would have atm, with these players no manager is gonna get results.
On that second goal seems like Partey pulled a muscle and walks off the pitch and then Arteta pushed him again to the pitch only for Partey to pulled a muscle again, great stuff right there. Why is even Partey playing? like why are they rushing him back?
Harry Kane is quite literally the complete striker,scores goals,assists and tracks back to defend. Class player. From a chelsea fan
Abs all you clowns said José was finished 🤣. Never Doubt The 🐐.  Only bad thing about this video was hearing Gary Neville 😴
Imagine supporting arsenal 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone who seriously thinks Aubameyang/Lacazette is a better pairing than Kane/Son needs to get their head checked.
Wenger in 😂
MESUT ÖZIL !!!!!!!!
Son has been outstanding this year. If he keeps this form up all season, I can see him being a Player of the Year contender along with Kane.
Organisation, discipline, and quality in the final third Vs lots possession.
Son alone has scored as many goals as Arsenal have this season. Think about that.
Bale I think I'll go back to Spurs to get some game time...
Son is dangerous!!⚽
That save from lloris vs lacazette. Class
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Honestly tho not a spurs or arsenal fan but seriously if you call arsenal aubameyang fc then what’s not to say that spurs aren’t Son and Kane fc both goalscorers today and both assisters today Kane even had the most clearances today without them spurs will never win the league
At least we didnt get destroyed like man u
TY:  KANE YOU'RE A CHEAT! I HOPE SPURS GET RELEGATED! 😂
Kane assists son then son assists Kane.WHAT A DUO!!!
Son is the best
Why did Partey go off the pitch. I mean why did he even go to Arsenal 🤣🤣
you never know with a north London derby game but this time I'm pretty sure the result didn't come as a surprise to anybody
Feel sorry for partey should of joined united
What a goal from son
We just indulging L's for fun in the league
How did united lose against this
Arteta Out
IS HOLDING SCARED OF DEFENDING SON OR WHATM
A thief found an arsenal jersey hanging outside in a garden. He stole the pegs and left the jersey. Gud ebenin.
I'm an Arsenal fan, but London is white right now.  Embarrassed to follow such a worthless team
I love it when spurs silences all the arsenal fans with their pure class and elite world class players.
Wish we had So at United. Smh.
Good ebening. This would never happen under my management. Very poor by Arteta.
Son... goal of the season....
Kane had two touches on the opposition box
ARSEnal
Now arsenal fan are crying 😭😭😭😭 for Arsene Wenger to came back...😂🤣😅😆😁
My players were embarrasing today, im sorry everyone.
Spurs are gonna win the league. Mourinho showing his class.
As a United fan I really wished things worked out for Jose at United.
Arsenal are heading for the relugation zone
son is class but other than that spurs play genuinely boring football
Runs like a truck, truck, truck Thighs like what, what, what All night long Let me see that SO-O-ON SON SO SO SO SON
AFTV gonna be lit tonight boys
1:10 is me in Fifa when I press shoot but the pass doesn’t make it to the player
Back to fm2021 where I can pretend that arsenal are decent.
Arsenal might be playing in the championship next season...😂🤣😅😆😁
As a United fan, lets be honest, we are happy for Spurs. Mourinho gets to showcase his capabilities, and also proves him right about United’s ownership issues.
son is absolute world class, (coming from a korean spurs fan)
Did Partey play on
Martin Tylers commentary for Son's goal was dead as Arsenal's chances of europa league
arsenal are actually in the mud
Paul Merson jinxed us.
Willian has to be the worst offensive player that Arsenal have signed since Francis Jeffers. 🤦🏻
NLDN IS OURS
Arsenal trying to replicate Sheffield United’s form in all competitions
now arsenal wish they were mid-table
If we were a racehorse we’d have been shot months ago.
Son hitting that finesse button 🤩 love to see it! Onto the next one boys, let’s get it! 🔥🏆
We still haven't beaten Mourinho.
arsenal has more of a chance of getting relagated then winning the league
Arteta is so overrated may as well be the Spanish Steve Bruce, he's ruined the attackers that were once good and respected like auba and laca.
Arsenal fans if you're buying an iPhone this Christmas please buy the iPhone 12 Pro Max and not the 12 or 12 Pro.  The bigger screen will ensure that you can see Arsenal when you open the league table on your phone.
Son's goal 😍😍
Didnt some point pundits say Arteta is better than Ole? Lol...thats never been the case and never will be
Mourinho seems to have found his team.  I'm thinking he's back.
Oi oi oi arsenal relegated oi oi arsenal relegated
Arsenal relegation candidates
Son is unstoppable
Arsenal, more like Arse-Anal the team
good result for Arsenal
Remember when everyone was saying Aubameyang is better than Kane 😂
Omd son who
You know it’s bad when Calvert lewin who costs less than 6 million is out scoring arsenal who cost 456 mill altogether
ITS TIME TO GO!!!
Son over kane any day - time we all sing sons praises
Arsenal are pathetic
Arteta in to make arsenal lose basically every game
WHEN IS IT GONNA END ROBBIE!
Spurs look on another level this year. Jose has got them believing. Then again they played arsenal.
Pogba scores a worldie, G Neville: A good strike Harry scores from six yards, G Neville: Oooohhhhh
We are shocking i can not think of a time when Arsenal have been this bad
Arteta is better than Ole apparently;  Arteta - 15th Ole - 5th, 5 points off the top of the table with the a game in hand.
Son's goal was better than bend it like Beckham
What's up with Aubameyang?  Ever since his new contract was signed, he's been garbage.
This is very fun
I didn’t watch the game, but if Arsenal’s highlights were a few headers... 😐
Banter Fc strikes again!!
first time ive watched that hojberg looks like a great signing for totenham
Partey really joined Arsenal to get relegated, dfkm🤣🤣🤣😂
AFTV should be interesting tonight.
Since Troopz went to America Auba not been playing well
Wobbie....it's time to go...
Commentary on the Son goal was terrible, one of the best goals of the season and the commentators are like “oh”
Alexandre Lacazette is such a losser player . At this point I'd rather have  Santos and Marouane Chamakh .  Least he could score a header
Bloody awful that was arsenal are like they are in limp mode they need to sort it out this isn't good enough
1:17 look at the right back. Totally given up.
NO NORTH SOUTH DIVIDE IS THERE MATE, YOUR NOT TELLING ME THAT LONDON FANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO TO A MATCH, AND THAT THE TIER IS HIGHER  IN SHEFFIELD, BOLLOCKS.
Can’t understand why William didn’t pressure Son before he shot. Embarrassing
Them man wanted Arsene out so bad.  LOL.
The Arsenal players didn’t even look bothered after the full time whistle. Says it all really.
Kane and Son duo is in amazing form this season
Bruh
Arsenal are the biggest joke in the UK 😂😂😂😂
“They’re not good enough robbie”
London is blue they end
Son🎌🎌🎌 Kean🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
auba who auba what
Watching Arsenal lose isnt just a hobby, it’s a lifestyle, a reason to breathe, an escape from this cruel world filled with thieves. it’s art, the first gift you open on christmas, a hug from a loved one, it’s everything you ever wanted, it’s everything you need
Pain so much pain why arsenal
People tip us for relegation as a joke It’s not even a joke anymore 🤦🏾‍♂️
Arsenal getting what they deserve for freezing out Ozil due to him speaking some truth. Hope they get relegated!
Benteke has scored more goals this season than Aubameyang. Benteke. *Benteke*
“Son score quite remarkably “  Mate that’s a legendary goal 🥅 Lol
We’re not even a third of the way into the season and Arsenal have already lost 6 games. This is bottom of the table relegation form. Hope they can stay up this season 😂
Why’s no one talking about that son goal?!
Sell leno
1:43 arteta pushing partey back on the pitch to stop the counter
610th
The lack of comments about son in this comment section is worrying
Arsenal in the mud hehe
Arsenal abysmal for 70 minutes, totally forgot Aubameyang was even playing...
Even though Arsenal are struggling right now, I genuinely think they have a chance to win the league soon   However Rotherham and Wycombe away should never be underestimated
Arsenal are gonna be having London derbies with qpr and Brentford next season
Arsenal had 70% possession this game and more shots Man what are we even doing We need wenger
Bad play by Bellerin on the first goal. He can see two players to the left. He knows he has 4 red shirts to his right to cover the lone Spurs player. He's looked around. He knows he has to go and help Rob Holding... and instead he is caught trying to cover the ball down the line to the overlapping Spurs player, loses his balance and Holding is caught undecided between pressing Son or covering the overlapping player. Bad habit of modern Premier league defending is this "falling back into a shape" bollocks instead of falling back and picking up your assignments as you move.  That there appears to be some kind of agreement between Holding and Bellerin for him to fold in behind the centrehalf who has neither the pace nor time to move to cover wide men is a terrible tactical decision by Arteta.  At 1:18, no 18 for Arsenal has long given up and walks off.
I’m waiting for the arsenal fans interview to pop up in trending or my feed ha ha
No respect for spurs and after this performance even less respect for spurs
We only lost by 2 goals and could've scored 2 ourselves. I'm impressed with the lads - Ty
Lol, Attack the RHS with bella & holding. Dumb manager with options just dont get it
Think arsenal want to bring ozil back in, wouldn't do them any harm
LeTS HavE A pArtEy!!!!!!
TILL JAN TBH. LOL
DT was spewing
Yid Army !!
Honestly what an incredible duo 🔥 Mourinho returning to his forte
You gotta pity 'Sign da ting' . Hilarious to notice some people praised Arteta over Ole after their lame penalty-aided win at Old Trafford
sackkk artetaaaaaa for dropping ozil, no tactics, no passion, no IDEA AT ALLLL🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Lacazette was our best defender and best attacker no disrespect on his name
Son and Harry Kane is such a deadly duo
Jesus I’m a Celtic fan and things are terrible just now! But I couldn’t imagine being an Arsenal fan, for the past 12-14 years (maybe longer) they are just.... pathetic! No fight no desire no care in the world with the players!  Arteta is doing what wenger done- not trying to change the way wenger set up and the style of players he had! They need to go for some big brutes instead of wee pussies!
Arsenal vs Burnely a tough fixture for us 😬
Free ozil     Bring back wenger
Clowns getting onto auba now bcz they know him being off form is the only time they can trash talk.. he will eventually be back and banging goals.
SECOND GOAL JUST TRASH DEFENDING
But was Dean Henderson's assist out or in......
North London is white!!
Kane n son carry Tottenham
Arteta is a genius, making arsenal get relegated so that next season they have a chance of winning the championship which will mean arsenal have a chance of winning the league for the first time in almost 20 years
Red boys having an early night tonight, very bad ebening! Well done boys, 🐓🐓🐓🐓coys 😁😁😁😁
Wenger out. !!!
Only Mourinho can have Kane, one of the best strikers in Europe, playing as a CDM but still bossing proceedings.
Arsenal scored only 10 goals in 11 matches but pays incredible money to their strikers and midfielders 0zil ... £350,000. weekly Aubameyang ... £250,000 Partey ... £250,000 Lacazette ... 180,000 Willian ... £100,000 Total: £1,130.000 _____________________________,_ Man City De Bruyne ... £350,000 Sterling .... £300,000 Aguero .... £230,000 Mahrez ... £120,000 Jesus ... £90,000 Total:  1,090.000 ________________________________ Liverpool FC Salah .... £220,000 van Dijk .... £180,000 Mane .... £150,000 Firminho ... £ 120,000 D.

What a hit son, what a hit
Have arsenal won a league game since they beat Utd?
Thanks for the memories, Mikel. It's time to go
Harry Kane made so many clearances. He's actually the best defender, midfielder and striker in the league
Waiting for mister DT
Arteta broke Klopp😂😂😂😂
Lovely throw ins from Bellerin  though
“Trust the process” 🤣🤣🤣
Kane is going to be all time top goal scorer in the prem. I don’t even support spurs but damn he’s a machine
Breaking News: Partey walked off the pitch as Spurs were scoring their second goal and is now on a flight to Madrid.
AFTV famous lines: Claude - IT'S TIME TO GOOOOO! DT - When is it going to end Robbie? Troopz - WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE AND GET TOP 4 BLUD Ty - Maupay you're a cheat, and I hope Brighton get relegated Robbie - Willian is a better player than Ziyech
SUCK IT GOONERS COYS
Son should be 90 rated
May aswell relegate arsenal now. I can’t wait to watch them play in the championship
What’s on lenos arm
Big Sam to take over at arsenal to keep them up
📡BREAKING NEWS: Arsen Wenger returning to Arsenal aged 97
Fun fact: spurs didn't have a shot in the second half
The day we lower our expectations the better
So many of Tottenham’s players today sacrificed their favoured styles of play for the benefit of the team...that was the hallmark of Jose’s Inter and there are loads of parallels here.
Aubameyang has done eff all since signing the "ting!" 🤣
Chelsea 8s better
"classic Jose Mourinho, classic Harry Kane."
it’s partey time
FREE SALIBA
I can sense the Banter FC jokes already.
Ahh should be a nice evening watching AFTV tonight 😂
No team can counter attack like Mous teams can.
League winners this year Spurs
Arsenal have scored just one goal from open play in their last SEVEN league games...that’s embarrassing
Jose doing what Jose does best ⚽️
Cheer up Gooners, Arteta will win the Europa league
The Portuguese Pulis wins the Pulis Derby.
North London is white as it always is nowadays! Spurs will get top 4 or more, Arsenal will be lucky to end up in top half of the table! Oh how the gooners have fallen love it hahaha
its happened again super son and super kane   yeeeeeeessssss
Tottenham are gonna win the league...
Who else are so used to the audio Sky sports puts of fans cheering that they actually  forgot they were there?
ohhh dear same old arsenal
Boring boring Tottenham  Boring boring Tottenham  Boring boring Tottenham
Arsenal aren't even in the conversation for top 6 anymore😂 they are miles off
As a tottenham fan, i am so embarrassed that arsenal is our major rival. Worst team i have ever seen.
Moment of silence for those who still have Aubaeyang in their Fpl
RIP Arsenal died 2020.
Arsenal fans trust the process okay
What a goal by Son!!!
Rip John Abraham
Son and kane must be the deadliest partnership
Can’t wait for Aftv reactions
Just shows how shiiiite European teams are for arsenal to be cruising in Europe but are fooking useless every where else....
Don't worry Arsenal fans. You won't get relegated. Fulham, West Brom, Burnley and Sheffield United are all worse than you.
People will say spurs just defend and counter but in reality it's called mourinho masterclass and it's the way u win games
Imagine the scenes if spurs win the league and Arsenal get relegated? 🤯🤯🤯
4 wins from 11 & 6 loses and arteta is the Messiah. Ole has 6 wins from 10 and somehow he's under pressure.
Aubameyang woke up feeling DANGEROUS🥶🥵 Goals: 0😳 Assists: 0 😐 Shots on target: 0😶  Ting signed: ✅🥰 Bottom of the league: 🙈😅😂 18 touches🔥🤯
it’s the hope that kills arsenal fans...
Aubameyang woke up feeling DANGEROUS🥶🥵 Goals: 0😳 Assists: 0 😐 Shots on target: 0😶  Ting signed: ✅🥰 Bottom of the league: 🙈😅😂 18 touches🔥🤯
It’s weird how arsenal had like 89% on the ball but still lost 😂😂
Aubameyang woke up feeling DANGEROUS🥶🥵 Goals: 0😳 Assists: 0 😐 Shots on target: 0😶  Ting signed: ✅🥰 Bottom of the league: 🙈😅😂 18 touches🔥🤯
How is Ozil not in this Arsenal team?!?! He is their best player
Aubameyang woke up feeling DANGEROUS🥶🥵 Goals: 0😳 Assists: 0 😐 Shots on target: 0😶  Ting signed: ✅🥰 Bottom of the league: 🙈😅😂 18 touches🔥🤯  MAZZZA
Who's here after DT lost the plot on the AFTV live stream LOOL
Kane and son the greatest duo? Don’t be ridiculous it’s obviously Fernandes and Rashford they word tear up any defence you fans don’t know nothing !!
Harry and Son are both world class.  Deadly in front of goal.
Tottenham play like the sweatiest FIFA team ever  10 men defending then counter
Robbie looking at his Bank Account Balance : P's ATM: What did it cost?  Robbie: Everything
They got their arsenal back
Spurs best they’ve ever been. Arsenal worst they been in a long long time, they still won’t win anything. Injury to Kane or son and their season has gone.
Like Roy Keane said, we have enough to stay up.
Mikel Arteta's tactics are so bad that when he saved it on his phone it was automatically deleted
Now arsenal are 15th relegation form soon come
I’m sure arteta is preparing to fill our ears with a load of bollox about possession how unlucky we were it’s time the board grew a pair and sack him
Can't wait for Aftv 🤣
Laccazette is average striker im being generous by saying that and Auba got his contract and has turned into Joe Linton.  Well done Spurs
🤬
tottenham think their gonna win the leuge by parking the bus go home dead ballers
Only player who can help assnel is ozill tbh
Robbie bout to get the bread for Christmas
Arteta: dresses like Guardiola ... manages like David Moyes
AFTV bout to get some VIEWS XD
I'm not trying to shy away from the fact we deserved to lose, 2 great goals from Son and Kane but regardless of the result do Spurs fans really enjoy watching that kind of football week in, week out ?
Deep down Ozil must be buzzing..
Another park the bus performance against a much worse team. A negative dinosaur of a manager. What's irritating is the respect he thinks his medieval brand of football deserves.
Kane and son are just too good man. Unbalieveable partnership. 💥💥 One of the best in premier league history.
arteta is out of his depth. persists with his favourite players every week and drops the ones that actually perform in europe. bellerin has made 5 foul throws in 11 games and yet he's the first one on the team sheet. auba looks disinterested but gets to start every week. willian was his signing and he's a 32 year old winger who offers us nothing. cedric was his signing and he can't even get ahead of the worst rb in the league. xhaka, ceballos, mustafi, amn, bellerin, holding, luiz all could have gone but arteta desperately wanted them to stay. his treatment of players like guendouzi, pepe, nelson, saliba, ozil, torreira, sokratis, martinelli, smith rowe etc. has been unacceptable. i'm done with this manager and also the board for appointing the cheapest and most inexperienced manager possible. top to bottom this club is a shambles.
What a goal Son
No creativity from Arsenal midfield, if you've got Partey and Xhaka then you need Ozil in that midfield 3 even if that means only 2 give meaningful defensive cover. Without Ozil the best years of Aubamayeng and the potential of the forward players are being wasted. Arteta and the board need to suck it up and focus on results before trying to impress China
Arsenal on the verge of relegation for the first time the way there going.
I LOVE U JOSE
If you know an arsenal fan check up on them they need it right now
2 London teams at the top of their game, the other very off colour (and close to relegation)
If you know an arsenal fan check up one them they need it right jow
Only thing I worry bout spurs idk what they doing if kane or son injured they like 99 percent of the team
I'm a Spurs fan but we did not deserve that
I have a feeling Aubameyang and Martial are competing against each other for the "worst striker award" this season.
I am a liverpool fan but spurs were World class
Kane and son >> mbappe and neymar
What a goal by son⚽️ Tottenham best player so far this season the guy is quality🔥💯
Arsenal are lucky that West Brom Fulham and Sheffield united are in the prem otherwise they’d be going down
Arsenal statistically can't go down this season, too any leagues one teams below them
What a goal from Son! Best moment of the game for me
Son is King! 👑
“When is it going to end Robbie?”
Only started our channel would appreciate subbing to us thanks
Kane and son looking like Ozil and Ronaldo I swear
As a west ham fan I can't say I enjoyed watching this
You don't give Mourinho 2-0.
It’s been a good ebening for spurs but bad year for the gunners so far.
Can we just deep how much space Holding had left for Tottenham 💔💔💔💔💔
The whole of Tottenham deserve a totw or even a toty
we got our AFTV back
Can’t wait to see Aubameyang do it on a cold rainy night in Stoke next season
Deluded Arsenal fans hounded Wenger out of the club. A guy who played great football and finished in the top 4 for years with limited budget. Now they are stuck with Spanish Tony Pulis who has got Arsenal in a relegation battle. Lol!
Arsenal had 11 shots and Spurs had 6  Referee was biased  Tottenham committed 16 fouls arsenal 12 70% possession for arsenal 30% for Tottenham  Mourinho parked the bus.
North london= ⚪⚪
Kane and Son may go down as the greatest duo in Premier League history.
Aubameyang hasnt scored a goal from open play since game week 1 lmfaooo
Arsenal better make that call to big Sam before it's too late 😂😂😂 your finished ha ha
COYSSSSS 💪 💪 💪 💪 💪 💪
You guys only upload the matches quickly whenever Arsenal lose! 😂💀
London is Spurs
Thank you Tottenham for beating our relegation rivals From a Fulham fan
Saddddddddd that arsenal nearly wins a game bruh
Luckily team in the premiership arsenal hammered them
Son is the son never disappoints a DAD
The commentary for that first goal is so dead. Son scores an absolute screamer in a derby and Tyler barley even raises his voice for it
Spurs 30% possession  They obviously play counter attacking football                      SONALDO
Mourinho just worked the bus who’s game
Arteta out
I never knew wenger leaving will be a blessing in disguise for us rival fans 😂😂😂
Martin Tyler and Gary Neville have to be sacked, horrendous commentators
Won’t be surprised if arsenal get relegated. 🤦‍♂️
Possession don't mean nothing if there's no end product, this match was a prime example of that!
WHAT A HIT SON!
I don't know whats worst the arsenal performance or the way bellerin wears his shorts tucked into his top. Definitely a bit fruity 😂
Mourinho really is one of the best managers of all time. In my opinion he is the best. Imagine if he was to win the league.
Son is WORLD CLASS another mourinho masterpiece!
Maradona told kane to stop going near post🤣still does it
Aubamayang since he signed da ting has scored less goals than Gallagher 🤣
Son is freaking world class and there’s no debate. From a United fan.
LONDON IS WHITEEE🤫🤫🤫
I actually just can’t watch us right now
classic jose mourinho , classic kane ,classic martin tyler
I for one sink Arteta will be amazing. Surely a guaranteed championship??!
Sonny for golden boot?
AFTV gonna moan😂😂
Gabriel was the most creative player for arsenal , their centre back 🤣🤣
Pray for Mr. DT’s wife 🙏🙏🙏
why is arteta still there? thought he said give him some time for the squad to shine but we are 11 matches in and arsenal are sitting 15th in the league
I’m fricking done with this banter club I’m killling my self no joke 💘
"Banter FC, back again!"
" Aubama WHo Aubama WHere" 😂😂
Where’s Thomas party at
Arsenal are so rubbish. Couldn't even beat the spuds. BANTER FC
son has the same amount of goals as arsenal this season lmaooo
Son-best in the league
Well, Arsenal may have lost, but at least they have the best Pierre in London...          oh wait.....
Son has the same amount of goals as Arsenal in the premier league this season what a player
Auba who?
Bellerin has committed some of the worst foul throws I’ve ever seen in my life this season 😭😭
Both on counter attacks wow
Hojbjerg could have shagged the ref’s missus, nan, aunt and daughter and wouldn’t have gotten booked
Things to realise from this game and season so far (arsenal fans perspective): Kane and son are the best duo itw Arteta is a Spanish tony pulis Auba is shite and holgberg is the best Pierre in London  Arsenal will be struggling to beat Wycombe next season I stg, being an arsenal fan and seeing spurs looking dangerous for the title and arsenal dangerous for relegation is killing me everyday
2 of the prettiest goals you’ll see all season. So glad the fans got to see them live!
They had AMN, mustafi, el neny , nketiah,willock and nelson on the bench and  ozil is at home eating bags of crisps
Arsenal in relegation battle, who would’ve thought 🤔
NORTH LONDON IS WHITE!!!!!!
Don't shoot emielle don't shoot
just tells you that possession doesn’t mean everything
judging by the fact that arsenal have lost, burnley gonna be waiting to destroy them next week
Son and Kane are best pairing since Richard and Judy!
Mourinho masterclass
Let’s be honest son is just world class (Chelsea fan )
*Son is an incredible player always has been wouldn’t be surprised if Real go in for him soon*
AFTV livestream was amazing. Banter fc back at it again
I’m done
Might be a job opening at sheff utd if artetas looking
Arsenal are done as a top six side.
Dt storms off is what we love to see
Big dub for arsenal they didn’t lose by 3 or more
I remember when abaumeyang was good. Top fraud
Son and Kane dominate the pl
How did we lose to this Arsenal team 😭
KBS in their primes would be illegal
COME ON YOU SPURS MANCHESTER IS LILY WHITE AND SO IS NORTH LONDON ⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️💙💙💙💙💙
Not watching arsenal till next season, no point
This just shows if auba didn’t perform last season arsenal would of been close to relegation !
Arsenal must improve
I literally forgot Partey even played for Arsenal
And they said they will beat us small club sit down and mind the gap
Spurs second goal came at a period when arsenal had 91% possession , just ridiculous
Dont worry Arsenal fans I still think you have enough to stay up in the prem
The Reports of My Death Were Greatly Exaggerated. "Mark Twain", on Jose Mourinho.
Joke of a club tbh 😂
I dont know why Diego simeone was complaining about partey leaving, he has one less fraud in his squad now.........
What a hit from son🔥🔥🔥
1st tip top Tottenham
