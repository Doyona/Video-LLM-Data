Live, die and Repeat.
I must be a lot older than the other commentors.  While I got the Ground Hog Day theme, all those commercials reminded me of my first series of Lay's commercials - Nobody can eat just one!  and Like that ad, Ryan couldn't stop at one, or two, or three.....  Brilliant man, Ryan.
I love how dire this commercial is.
You gave me a key right?
Here we go again
"I can put people in a time loop"  - a wise superhuman
Sometimes I wish I could peer into the what if and see what it would be like if they continued to make more of these commercials for the rest of the flavours.
You know an ad is good when people willingly watch it
Isn't that the villain from the Garfield movie?
Not sure if she remembers him but he sure as heck fire remembers her!
I sure as heckfire remember you 😂
Ned?
My man you make such good ads I would have watched the whole list of lays flavors and then the poppables lmao
🎵So, put your little hand in mine,  There aint no hill or mountain we can't climb...🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
So many different Lay's flavors means so many different choices to choose from.
What an awful exploitation of a great movie.
3:45, hostage of addiction, be like
I turn my computer on and for weeks now I get MSN News that Lays are tainted and going to kill me and under that is an ad announcing 6 new flavors?!  I'm so confused!
Ned Ryerson.
How many flavors of lays? Paula, Stephanie, Gab, Alex, Vicky, Vicky, Sarah............ect.
i really enjoyed this  watching tv that night and these comercials.. i went out and bought a bag of lays what a sweet time. thank you lays..  i guess they didnt do it this year or i missed it
I didn't know Lays was doing episodes of Black Mirror now.
Ok, we get it! Again..,
Nikki blonsky???
Ned?
This is so awesome!!!
"And I'll say it again." She wasn't kidding.
Ned might be a God!
Laurie Metcalf is an Angel 😍,  P.S. she and Stephen Tobolowsky are Toy Story Stars, Laurie is Jennifer Davis (Andy's Hot Mom), and Stephen is Ron Tompkins
Dude, just go to a different cashier.
God bless Steven  tobolowsky
Action Jack Barker and Artemis lol
I wonder if Ryan Reynolds is aware that his ads are going to be studied in marketing/advertising/copywriting classes for decades to come.
Ahhhhhhhhhhh🤵🤵🤵🧟
I could watch this all day ...every day...
Free Guy!
Look it's Artemis from Always Sunny!
I kept waiting for Bill Murray to pop up out of nowhere and punch somebody 🤣
For some hell's heaven.
i remember him from Heroes tv series, he has alchemy power but killed easily by silar...such a waste of character and power back then...
Cool video
If kind of feels like Artemis is gaslighting Happy Chapman
Got me crazy for some Lay..z?
Flavors for days y’all
No salt and vinegar???
Artemis!
Bro is the villain of garfield
Um... first commercial in a long time I can't stop watching?!
Well that got dark fast.
This got nightmarish fast…
Damnit! I watched the whole thing! Ryan! What have you done to advertising?!?! 😂
Creativity of that advertisement, just keep me coming back😅😅😅
Fuck. This was a master piece.
The Conjoined Triangles of Success!!!
Just saw this ad on tv! Split up throughout the show how freaken awesome!🎉
Bing!
How did this went from an ad to a creepy short film!? XD
Missed opportunity; I kept waiting for the revenge of Ned Ryerson.  And before you ask yourself "what does he want us to do (insert crazy idea here)."  YES.
they're called walkers
Just wait till he finds out about exclusive regional flavors
😂😂
Y think that Stephen s face looks like Jameses the red engine face of thomas and friends
freaking Jack Barker from Silicon Valley! How the heck did he escape from China factory!?
Feels like time punishment in the TVA.
O.C.P.
Avengers: la saga de lays
I love this style of ad!
Artemis looks fantastic, always loved her on Always Sunny.
Betcha Can't Eat Just One!
Yeah but i watched it at 10x speed
Lay's don't even taste good Mid AT BEST
Where Ketchup Lays! ?
I had the pleasure of meeting Stephen at my club and had a chance to talk to him for a bit and he is one of the most pleasant, gracious people I’ve ever met. Down to earth and makes you want to be a better human being. Very few actors on this planet that you can say that about. Him, Keanu Reeves, Johnny Depp, Mr. Reynolds here and Adam Sandler. I’m sure I’m leaving out a few. Just every day guys with a very public job. Which I don’t know how they deal with on a daily basis. God bless all of them.
That’s crazyyyyy !!! 😜
All I hear is "Conjoined triangle of success" 😂😂
that's what he's doing when he's not in his office in Pied Piper.
This guy is a legend! I was expecting him to say "it's a doozy".   We need another Groundhog day type film, they're brilliant.
Is that the guy from sillicon valley?
It's a doozy
That was shit...
WHATS THE SONG IN THE BACKGROUND?
why doesn't he go to a different cashier.
The Jeep Commercial is 1000x better.
Watch out! The first bite is a doozy.
The irony of me watching this over and over again….
Thats a dooosy
Are we in hell? LOL
Thanks to you Ryan., I now I have a fear of Lays Potater chips! OMG! NOOOOOOO! 😱
Oooh, they make vegi poppables??
🔥 Lays Flaming Hot GANG🔥
WE NEED MOREEEEEE
“Phil Connors is that you?”
Psyche
😂😂😂😂😂
Fear the lays
If I’m being honest, I have a bit of a crush on the cashier. ❤️😂
The good old vibes!
Happy Harold Ramis Day, everyone.
"Action" Jack Barker
Are we in hell?😂
I like commercials with mess up creepy storylines. And timeloops.
Principle Ball? GOLDBERGS???
at 4:03 I got an amber alert and I have never felt such fear before.
Why do we have like 3-4 types of lays only in Europe? :(
Artemis lost weight.    Why is this on Ryan reynolds channel?
Just keep in loop
Great choice of actors.
I was lucky enough to cross paths with Stephen a few years ago in Woodstock, IL where they filmmed Groundhog's Day. They put on a weekend festival every year and invite back cast from the movie. That year Stephen was there doing autographs for the new book he wrote. I passed him in the hall, there was Ned in all his glory. My wife had zero clue who he was in the moment 😂.
Nice!!!
just realize this is in TVA
Coming from one who has worked at a grocery store this is hell
leave it to ryan reynolds to make an ad with just the right amount of existential dread
This may be the best spin-off I've ever watched. 😂
He really has me watch a super bowl commercial with out the Superbowl
Bing!😂
Artimus to the max
I love this ❤
Deadpool saying "Cymru am byth", as a Welsh person, this is officially the best timeline.  Wryan has awakened a new form of patriotism in my heart, its Maple Dragons all the way. Also, up the Eagles!
DAMMIT RYAN!!!🤣🤣🤣
Lays have great products, they basically sell themselves. But they won't let up on keeping them front row wherever ppl are watching
artimes for life
Better writers for Stephen Tobolowsky, please. You’re wasting his brilliant talents.
Delightfully chilling
this feels like the lasagna cat survey video
He's like, is this hell?... She shoulda bean like, yes, it is
This is the only add that I purposefully searched up when it wouldn’t finish playing on my original video.
This feels like Loki bro
This is a great storyline. They should produce a full-length film based on the idea!
Got tedious  real fast
Bing!!
The conjoined triangles of success 😂
Yeah... thats one hell even i wouldnt want to try.
It’s Tor Eckman!
That was the most terrifying potato chip commercial I’ve ever seen
Bing!
The best commercials!! Beautiful movie, a great actor, just brilliant
That was so silly.
Get Lay'd.
The amount of times I had to rewind ten seconds because I had to get up and a few times only added to my insanity. Also I hate to say it but I need closure for this short will this man go through every flavor and is this some sort of hell 😂
This just makes me miss "The Goldbergs".
See, if he used the conjoined triangles of success, he'd have seen what was really going on., Because it's taught in business school.
Kinda reminds me of his character in 'Memento'... 🤔 🍄
Great commercial.  You can't escape.....these amazing flavors!!!
This is good marketing lol
Why does he only buy 1 bag of potato chips instead of other stuff like Milk, eggs, fruit, etc..?
3:14-3:34 is my absolute favorite part. It feels like some genuine Stephen Tobolowsky.
Stephen Harold Tobolowsky
Why is a video by Ryan Reynolds in my recommended?
Ned! Ryerson! Needle-nose Ned, Ned the head, come on buddy Casey Western High!  …bing…
You clever bastard. I haven't watched this many commercials in 10 years.
This has an Adult Swim feel to it.
These are the best series of commercials I've seen in a long time.
That’s actually an awesome set of adverts, need more weird adverts with interesting ongoing story see “long long man” ads from japan
This parody idea could have been so much better but what you all did here just didn't work.
LOL hahahaha pretty good :)
He keeps going to the same register 😂
Nice how it ended up being American horror story 👌
Wow, this is how you do advertising 👏 👏 👏
Hm, thank you for helping me decide to never buy a lay potato chip ever again for the rest of my life.
hahaha this is fantastic!
If you watch the whole commercial you are also in the matrix
Genius
Watch that first chip... it's a doozy!
Stephen Tobolowski was hilarious on Deadwood.
Damn you Reynolds and your ingenious marketing campaigns *raises fist and shakes at the sky*
This guy never ages wow!
Classic lays
bag of AIR
Cringe
Thank you Ryan, I'm never getting out of your stream now 😮😢😊
Couldnt get Bill?
Every time
My lays are my passport.
Actually, this commercial makes no sense because she is saying something different every time. The flavor of the chips. So no, this is not like the movie.
Loved him as Jack Barker in Silicon Valley
the ending! 🎉🎉🎉
I bet there's a secret one they're saving for the Super Bowl where he does help close the cash register and breaks the loop.
Bing again!
Jack Barker?
Where’s Ryan Reynolds in this?
Tobolowsky LEGEND
ok, i'm buying some Lay's today
“And I’ll be back because I’m never getting out of here” lol
The way he's walking around like a mental patient displaying a bag of chips that yeah, don't even have any chips in them...
The grocery store I work at uses that same pos system and receipt printer, that's crazy. I thought everyone else stopped using that system in the mid 2000's
Ryan is the only person to turn Groundhog Day into a horror film disguised as a lays ad
I was waiting for him saying "BING!"
Phil: Do you ever have déjà vu, Mrs. Lancaster? Mrs. Lancaster: I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen.🤣🤣🤣
Hey it's action jack barker
I did not know this was a thing, but it's great.
This reminds me of those Adult Swim fake ads. I wish they made more of those...
Stephen: BILL HELP MEEE!
By the end,, the guy has to have diabetes.
Ned! Ryerson! 😂😂😂
This is why I never finished watching Groundhog Day!!🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Oh, Ryan... you scamp. Always bringing back the oldies but goodies! BTW, watch that first step it's a DOOZIE!😂
Why does everything have to about buying shit...
My life , I sat through that from 03:35 Thursday, my life I am not getting back. Confused all over, Lays lays drawers. Cool though. Walkers Christmas Pudding flavour - be the best.
Love this
Now I am in the mood for some Pringles...
stay happy
Stephen Tobolowsky is one of those actors that when I see him in film or TV, I think "Oh cool. I like him!". And suddenly believe that  whatever I am going to watch will be better than I originally assumed....presumed? One of those, yeah.
I'm old school . "Lays ! Bet you can't eat just one ." Works  better for me .
is that Ned? Ned RYERSON?
This is very [adult swim]
😂😂😂😂 at the end he gave up
I’m ashamed to say by the 5th time seeing it, and complaining nonstop about how there  isn’t anyone else advertising, it finally hit me what day it was.
Day 3, and I'm definitely headed for Aisle 1. Line be damned.
Good old Ned.  Ned Ryerson?  Needle nose Ned!
Ned Ryerson.
Ryan successfully made us watch a 4 minute long ad
Ned? Ned Ryerson…???!!!
No joke I’m getting Lay’s when I get off this train I’m on lmao- good job
Artemis was a perfect choice for this lmao- Tobolowski too, but we already knew he was incredible with the Groundhog Day stuff 😂
This would be way more funny if Bill Murray were buying the chips and Stephen were the cashier 😂
Man maybe one day whoever made this will be famous or something 😂
This is the first time in my entire 59 years on this plant that I have watched a commercial for 4 minutes. I think the previous record was 15 seconds.
Seriously I think Ryan Reynolds just needs to buy any brand and start doing their advertising. This is hilarious, and I could see them just putting out one new commercial every few weeks or each month, and just not say what they are doing. Just watch for how long it takes before people watching the commercials realize what is going on. It would be epic.
I didn’t even realize this was uploaded by Ryan Reynolds.
I was just watching a live performance of the knock knock joke, "Aren't you glad I didn't say banana?"🤡
Why do he keep going to checkout at lane 2?!!!
Do you have Déjà Vu, Ryan?  You're meant to answer: I don't know, but I can check with the kitchen.
Bring back Guacamole Lays please.  They always had me coming back.  Until they were gone.  😢
Getting Stephen Tobolowsky to do this was a stroke of genius, and I actually watched all eight of these. Mission accomplished
I will never not be upset that, in the first one, he didn’t say “Watch out for that first chip, it’s a doozy!” Paying homage to “betcha can’t eat just one.”
This was a cute idea, but man I really hate how inhumanly the guy carries those chips to give a clear, unobstructed view of the product at all times. No one carries chips that way. No one on earth. Ever. It looks so weird. As much effort as they put into this series, they could've tried a little harder to make the product placement a little more natural.
this was good but a little disappointed that there was no salt and vinegar.
Japanese Commercial for the Long Long Man Sakeru gum did a sequential release of commercials that followed a full story arc to an even funnier conclusion. Youtube has the sequence available.  Thanks for sharing this, great ad.
IT'S NED! RYERSON!
where are the salt and vinegar ones.......
33 seconds in and the cringe already makes me want to shrivel up like a raisin.
Plot twist, he gets Pringles.
not funny
Ned Ryarson? Needle nosed Ned, Ned the head?
Nt sure
I love how the music starts to take a turn LOL
Didn't that actor gt charged with rape yrs ago?🤔
I've never craved lays more in my life
You know it's bad when Ned gets annoyed.
Stephen Tobolowsky is a really good actor, one of my faves
did he finished he box?
NED!?!?  (*KER-POW!)
Brilliant the last one left me wanting more Lays and More Ads
Lay's movie directed by Crisptopper Nolays
NED...NED RYERSON?
You could have used something fake brand and not an actual brand... big negative N-O from me Ryan... and you are not gonna get sorry either. just an unlike thumb down. ive given you a free pass before, when you are promoting your own brand, but this felt like 4 minute advertisement video. #notfunny
There has never been a celebrity more deserving of a lifetime supply of a product they endorsed and Ryan wasnt even in the commercial
They should make a lays ketchup one for the canadian viewers
These are brilliant!!😂😂  The 2/2, the music changing slightly each time, the cashier's responses! 😂 Excellent work, Lays!
I don’t think he paid for any of those chips.
"Ooo, they make veggie poppables?!" that made me laugh so hard. I wish all commercials were like this.
god dam it! I wan f'in Lays now.  Those flammin hot ones look good.
Whoever directed these commercials needs to get a raise.
NED RYERSON
This is amazing.
Alright... this IS a good commercial.
this would drive me nuts....but i love the movie.....but i love the movie...but i love the movie
Hilarious and brilliant. Congrats to those who developed this.
Ned?!
"Remember Sammy Jankis"
What that first chip.  It's a doozy.
Oh my gosh this is PERFECT! It just gets FUNNIER! 😆 Now they MUST make a movie about this to continue the tradition!
Now Ned Ryerson gets to experience the Groundhog loop.
i didn't notice that it was different flavors for the first half of it 😵‍💫
Dr. Berkowitz
Ned Ryerson?!?!?
It's a doozy
Wait did Ryan Reynolds buy lays too?
Remember Sammy Jankis
Well, he got a lot of Lay's, but obviously not Lay'd.... since Lay's got too much air....time.😅
10,000 Years later ...
I think the mushrooms just kicked in...Reynolds is some kind of freak genius... freak CREATIVE genius
Why do I have a feeling this is connected to the Multiverse
Lay's *Endless Eight* Campaign
This kinda reminds me of great choice but without the violence and I love it
Ned Ryerson?!?
Ned? Ned Ryerson!!!😮
She reminds me of the witch on WandaVision.
Four minutes to set up that punchline—comedy genius! AHAHAH
I love when adverts have fun like this
Remember Sammy Jenkis
Ryan went full "Bleak Black Mirror time loop" didn't he.
Love me some Artemis
BING!
Damn this makes me want to by lays which personally, eh
I love it when ads are funny and not just pure advertisement.
Hey, that's Jack Barker from Silicon Valley.
Same grocery store as used in good girls and birds of prey
Am I right or am I right?😂
This is fantastic!
It’s Bob from Heroes! :D
so glad ryan took time out of his busy schedule to contribute to the obesity epidemic. he's not doing it for money. shorter life expectancy is good for the environment
RYYYYERRSONNNNN!
Some people: "Ned Ryerson!" Other people: "Ryan Reynolds!" Me: "Hey, he was also on Glee!"
Legends say he’s still in there…
"Ned Ryerson, I have missed you so much."
triangles of success!
Doesn’t this man have a high school class to teach on disney channel 🤨😤 no time for dilly dallying in the grocery store!! 😂
Now I want chips.
YEAH NED, SUCK IT! SUCK IT! THAT'S HOW IT FEELS! YOU ALL CHEERFUL AND SHIT NOW, NED?! *HUH?!!*
If you watch this in reverse you can hear Greg Kinnear singling Summertime.
I got you Babe...
ooh they got veggie poppables?! 🤣
You can make the same commercials with just about any snack product on the market - flavor varieties the world is not lacking
sorry but LAYS is in the boycott list, keep boycotting those bastards  EVEN if u hate palestine do it for the excessive working conditions here in the canada/us as well demanding lawsuits and shutting down random farmers for using "the same kind of potato"
“Dormamu, I’m here to bargain!”😂😂😂
Enough lay's i would eat, i will never get layed.
0:40
Looks like someone decided to go shopping on groundhog day...
I've commented something funny 3 times and it's been deleted every time..... This is hell.     😈😱😭
I don’t know….I saw several of these. They have to be the dumbest commercials I’ve seen in a long time.
Thanks to the internet SuperBowl commercials nowadays are spoiled during the week leading up to the game. One of the things I remember about watching Super Bowls in the '80s and '90s is seeing the over-the-top commercials for the first time on game day. They are not special if you've already seen them several days in advance.
Sammy Jankis wasn’t the one with memory loss
why did i waste my time here, i shouldve studied
Glad the joke came because especially the first one was hard to watch, the last laugh was so cringy
Ok this commercial is genius on so many levels! The homages to GHD move with the same actor that played Ned. And I literally keep coming back to each commercial…so these lays commercials keeps me coming back for more.
I went out to Walmart and bought some Lay's after this commercial.
This... this is how you commercial.
Great comercial!  I hope you were sponsored by Lays.
"Ned? Ned Ryerson...?" 😂
Holy Heckfire that was great!!
I love that there’s a cleanup in isle 5 and the guy with the mop and bucket is walking away from isle 5
Needle Head Ned went pro with the Whistling Bellybutton Trick.
Wait is that Artemis from Always sunny in Philadelphia??
If only on the last one Phil Conners would have checked out at the lane next to him.  "Good luck buddy..."
perfect in every way...even her name "LuLu" is repetitious.
You could make movie out of this
Let's associate our product with a eternal, unending hell... give these marketing peeps a raise!
NED!!!!
OMG...😂 Thanks for sharing this, Ryan.
When you’re playing a good game then start noticing the npc writing is rather bad
Okay, that was an amusing ad.
Stephen Tobolowsky has hardly changed in the last 30 years. Really makes ya think...
brilliant
Glad to see Happy Chapman doing well after all these years.
mass advertising reported. ryan reynolds is a jerk
this would be a great concept for a movie
Ned Ryerson? The guy with the whistling belly-button??
soo are they saying there chips are devils food?
😂😂😂
Don’t make him hold it so obviously/blatantly for product placement.. it ruins and throws off the entire skit/ promotion Ruining something perfectly good with unesscary cringe Theres definitely other ways of holding or showcasing it without forcibly displaying it like simba xD
Am I the only one remembering him from Memento?
Lol i gotta watch the movie again. Also more ads should be this funny i wouldnt skip them
This should have been a super bowl ad LOL. Anything Ryan does is perfect.
Hi.. My name is.. NED..RYERSON.. My Lays is my..PassPort? Chipify.. me
Endless eight? Reminds me of those Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya days.
Lol, kept seeing this commercial while watching the Groundhog Day marathon on AMC all day
How many bags of Lays chips did he take home
Haha
Seeing some flavors I can't get here in Germany makes me envious.  Only have 5 classic flavors + 3 restaurant ones.
Holy shit Artemis is in great shape.
They put HIM in the loop! WHOA.
FYI bbs Lays is on boycott, usually my favorite chip but  FREE PALESTINE 🍉🤟🏽
By the dill bag hes just so fed up, he doesnt even pay😂
Ryan Reynolds got his ass beat on 2fort
The Heavy is buying Lay's
Ned….ryerson!   Lol.
That was a real plot twist when she told him, he’ll never leave, because lays has an abundance of different colored bags. She’s the guardian demon to the gates of hell LMAO
I did not realize Lay's had so many different flavors.
The flaming hots for hell is just so stupid, i love this. HAHAHA, again!
Wtf are lays?
Hahahaha them Lays won't stop complaining, I mean coming.. and take it from the top, take 365, and go!!😂😂😂😢😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😮😂😂😂
Least unnatural cashier interaction:
lay's lore
Maybe... try another checkout lane🤔
Why did Ryan Reynolds post this?
Why am I still surprised when I come here to watch ads? These are all gameday ads except... they're just normal ads I wouldn't doubt that these companies would use them on gameday though, how could you not these are fuckin amazing, with this set alone play one for each commercial break and really tell a story with it that people will undoubtedly watch and love.
The Chronicles of Ryerson
The fact you got Bill Murray, pushing the cart in the background, for the one repetition is pure awesomeness, and I feel some of this might be trolling. Well done Ryan! :D
I JUST LOVE PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!! 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
BING!
Ned! Ned Ryerson! Bing!
BING again!
The same commercial several times for only one view?   *W H A T   A   D E A L !*      I'mma go eat a pringle now.  Singular.
I like food. Who here also likes food?
NED!  RYERSON!  :D  NEEDLENOSE NED! NED THE HEAD! C'MON, BUDDY  Fun fact: He did the whistling belly-button trick at the high school talent show.
yep, that works! bit costly to take a full 4 mins but hey, people might actually watch it and care to remember the brand! :D
Dang it, it’s way too good of marketing
Tobo!
only saw the first one on tv, was wondering why it seemed so strange, I guess this explains it :)
"Is it too early for flapjacks?"
Now Ned knows what it feels like to live the same day over and over and over again.
Duviri in a nutshell
cgi so obvious
This... Is.... AWESOME!!!!
NED?! Ned Ryerson!? BING!!! I thought that was you!
Jajaja epico
BING!!
Even when I want them to, they don't miss.
Ned Ryerson in _Groundhog Day._
I love their taste, but I find this ad so cringy.
Ned? Ned Ryerson?!
Jack barker finally found purgatory
ryan forgot it was leap year
That got dark lol
Looks like somebody didn't remember Sammy Jankis
Good to see a marketing team following the Conjoined Triangles of Success!
Why yes, I would like some Lays...
lol
What font is used for "A Maximum Effort & Kimmelot?"
this reminds me of wandavision
I loved the subtle changes in the music as each wore on :D
I don’t know what’s a better strategy… this 4 min commercial all at once, or each 30 second one as like 10 separate commercials 😂
Remember Sammy Jankis
This is what passes for "the best" Madison Avenue has to offer?  (SMH)
this is brilliant! Love them all. : )
I love the fact that Ned gets to live the nightmare now
Well, there could be worse things to have Groundhog Day, uhm, Lays.
lol “are we in hell?” Got me
I didn’t even realize who posted this
Man!! i saw the whole thing, congrats to thw writers, they manage to make it interesting until the end, despite beign f&%$ing annoying.
Meh...
I sure as heckfire remember him!
There was a 30th anniversary yesterday (I don't know why as Groundhog day came out in February 1993 so that would make this the 31st anniversary)
ned ryerson?
Needlenose Ned? Ned the head?
Oh Ned
Ned!...Ryerson!
What the hell? That Chile Limon Lays got an old fashioned Sabritas logo?
She WANTS YOU brooh.
I just want Lay's to bring back the original barbecue flavor in the orange bag, you know, the one Duckie is eating from in Pretty in Pink. I would buy 500 bags. (And I would buy 500 more.)
Artemis is looking good
I love a commercial that has sexual innuendos. Your food and you sell sex at the same time. Way to go Mr Ryan Reynolds! I need a fast forward button 😭
I now need a horror movie written, directed and produced by Ryan Reynolds...
Thanks Ryan😂😂
Woah, I've just realised the CEO from Silicon Valley was Ned
He carries those chips better than I carried my first born son.
That's what happens when you run your business with the 2 conjoined triangles of success.
Now you know what it’s like Ned! 😂
Next trip to the groceries I'm buying Lays. They have me sold
Love seeing Tobo. This was really well made.
Bill Murray... The ONLY Legend Ryan Reynolds can't afford.
These ads just keep me coming back for more
“Do you have Lays? Cuz if you do, you could always use a little more. Am I right or am I right or am I right, right, right, right?”
This is a great ad 😂😂😂
I've never heard of Lay's but I just watched 4 mins of commercials about them for some bizarre reason...
I miss the dislike button
Ryan can you please be the first person ever to make a chip commercial without the fake chip bags? Thanks!
That last one is a doozy
They didn't show the one where he punches her?
it would be funnier if it were Bill Murray and not Ned
I was just in the middle of a rewatch of Heroes. Stephen Tobolowsky on my screen. Hit pause. Then switch to YouTube and there he was again, first video in my suggested videos. Am I stuck in Groundhog Day?!?!
what an story arc!
I mean... clearly this was made in preparation of the Super Bowl. Genius move, really!
Ned? Ned Ryerson?!?!
These videos published by Ryan Reynolds sure keep me coming back!
I need to go to the states to get more Lay's flavors... Hey Ryan! Wanna buy me a ticket or send me a mixed pallet of Lay's? 😂
😅😂😅😂😅💯😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅 Mr  maximum effort you mak me want the LAYS 😅😂🤣😂🤣💯😂🤣😂🤣😂💯🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣💯😂🤣😂🤣💯🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣💯🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣💯🤣😂🤣😂🤣💯🤣😂🤣💯🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣💯
Ned Ryerson! Is that you???
Theater worthy.
Ryan is just so good at making interesting commercials... And props to the actors! And the sound department.
Unexpected Artemis
Let's replace commercials with short films please
xcvbxcvb
Lays Oxygen Flavor!
ITS NED! NED RYERSON
Thanks to corporate greed. This is a very expensive snack now. And corporate brags that consumers will just get used to it. Boycott all chip's and eat popcorn. And prices will drop. Be well....
Poor Ned... got his own loop
Ok, this is pretty incredible. This would be amazing at the Superbowl every commerical break play a different one.
😂😂😂😂
Genius 🧠
he sure as heckfire remembers the last deja vu.
Last one was good caught you off guard.
This was about 4 mins too long
I may be the exception but I hated these attempts at humor. Will never buy Lay's again.
🤣🤣🤣
They should have done a duet rendition of I Got You Babe
Aisle two…how symbolic
Omfg it's Artemis
Ned Ryerson? Awesome 😎
Watching this on a Monday is like double dipping into the metaverse.
I am a little disappointed that they were on the third go round before I realized the significance of the fact that they were on register number 2.
Fantastic
- It's a Lay's, Sammy - Lay's this you fkn quack🖕
That was a doozy of an idea
What the fuck is this
Not once did he pay for any of those chips he's walking away with.
This thing got dark pretty quick
Man Artemis had a huge glow up
It's Ned Ryerson!  He did the whistling belly button trick at the high school talent show!  He got the shingles really bad senior year and almost didn't graduate, and then he dated Mary Pat, Phil Connors' sister until Phil told him not to anymore.  He sold life insurance until he wound up in a crazy grocery store time loop.
Never knew Lays had so many flavors.  In my country we only get three.  😢
Artemis !!!!! Rob must have been I know someone who would be really great !!
Just get me the next Deadpool. It's a crime they keep bumping it!
God I hate lays
The conjoined triangles of success. They teach that in business schools now
Advertising has really gotten out of hand when you have to watch 2 commercials before watching a commercial lol😅
The slight changes in music were a great touch!
Bing!
Needle nose Ned! Ned the Head! I dated your sister, Mary Pat, until you told me not to!
Isn't that the guy who did the whistling belly button trick in my high school talent show?
It always disturbed me that in the final timeline, Phil bought more insurance than he'll ever need from Ned Ryerson.
Ryan Reynolds as the main character in a Groundhog Day reboot would be pretty epic
One of the most *meta* ad series ever conceived.  What was brilliant about it is that these ads were run throughout a daylong endless repeat of the movie Groundhog Day on AMC.
By the third bag, I was trying to guess how she was going to change the flavor into something clever each time.
Ned Ryerson???!!! PUNCH!!!!!
Ned? Ned Ryerson!
Different flavors every time
Why am i stuck in a time loop?
This has "Unedited Footage of a Bear" vibes.
Remember Demolition Man with Sylvester Stallone where they are singing jingles? Commercials are better than movies nowadays. This advertisement has electrolytes.
I miss good ads like this!
Bag sound effects are too fucking loud.
He forgot to sell her insurance.  He'll be back.
I will only eat Lays once in a while. If it were Utz, I'd do that for eternity. This was fantastic. I love Groundhog Day. I want more.
"Are we in Hell?" hahahahahahaha!!!
Ned Reyerson? 😆
I can't wait for Dan to see this
I think they should have gave Ned the part of the cashier and a little cocaine
Wait until he finds out about all the exotic, fish flavored LAYS chips they sell in the Asian markets. 🤢
I actually look forward to watching RR’s commercials. Posting before I watch. Don’t let me down! 😂
It's a glitch in the Matrix.
Smartest commercial ever
Poor Ned.
Thank you for uploading this.
I knew it was a commercial going in...still don't regret it!
Good thing our man loves chips or he would be seriously hooped.
Hi Ned
😂😂😂
Onions
Then she got mad at because of something I did to myself with an onion.
So you want people to not watch your movies anymore?
This must be what being an actor is like, constantly having to do retakes with only minor cahnges each time. In Ryan's case the retakes clip is usually a lot longer!
You have to admire the commitment of Lay's. A 30 second spot during the Super Bowl is expensive enough, but 8 of them?? Honestly, that was the best $56,000,000 commitment to a joke ive ever seen
Who else is ready for Groundhog Day 2 starring Ned Ryerson waking up to a time loop and desperately trying to figure out the exit???😊
Lays Gourmet for me
❤❤❤
Will this be played throughout the superbowl?
I clicked this by my own volition and I enjoyed every second of it.
BING!
Artemis got her job back at the WAWA!
Such a great movie idea. Where the main character must break out loop commercials kind of like Happy Deathday😁
Aww I wish we had Lays in Australia, so many flavours 😋
Happy Groundhog Lay’s… but if you ask Stephen Tobolowsky he’d probably say Happy Groundhogs Lay
I guess Bill Murray wasn’t interested. You know for sure they asked him!
Action Jack Barker
Pepsico always delivered in terms of marketing and ads. Great job. Pity the company didn't left russia and still earn money there and pay taxes sponsoring terrorism... :(
Artemis!
I hope they also makes a Lay's commercial about the Endless Eight.
And they say  he still there Buying lays Everyday
yes
i just spent 4 minutes watching a commercial and im wiping tears from my eyes.. good job Ryan lol
What in the name of TVA is this, is this Deadpool 3 sneak peak 🫵
Oh boy, she's not kidding, if they add the regional and national flavors, he will be stuck there for a long long time 😅
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bing!
Strange I see walkers crisps
Wow, I can’t believe they got the original actor from the movie for this one- good for them.
the conjoined triangle of success
Is that Artemis??
He's in the Matrix. Whyyyyy won't they let him go??
Lays... Go to Asian Market. Find all kind ...
I love the ads. Always entertaining. Just keeps me coming back.
I wonder how much lays paid Ryan to post this because the only reason I watched it was because he posted it
Poor guy
R.I.P Harold Ramis
Remember Sammy Jankis
Never forget that Ned Ryerson was in a band with Stevie Ray Vaughan
Steven was bandmates with the late great Stevie Ray Vaughan..  He was in his band for a while, at least.. Lucky bastard..
0:00 "This will be fun! 3:00 This video will never end!
was weird seeing this guy in an ad that's not a ubiquiti ad. he acts so similar
the cashier has a bleached asshole
I heard that cashier has a bleached a**hole
We better get going if we’re gonna stay ahead of the weather.
I have never feared for my life more than just now.🥺
The Groundhog Day movie is the second best thing about Feb 2nd. The first best thing is my youngest brothers birthday ^u^
NED RYERSON!
How to turn an ad into a horror movie
Most kids today dont get the reference. They are just gonna think that this is copied from some anime called 'rezero'.
bro didnt even get to eat any
"Do you KNOW how many Lay's flavors there are?" That line demonstrates why this video is actually secretly advertising genius
NED!!!!!!!!!!     <3
If ads did this, I don't think ad blockers would be as popular.
just wait until he finds out about the weird international only flavors
I love how the register 2 sign became more skewed each time
Fair enough, you can't say fairer than fair enough
Artemis looks great! Do another Sunny episode. PLEASE!
Remember Sammy Jankis ❤
I watched the whole thing. Totally worth it! Stephen is the best
Brilliant i wish they coulda got bill as well at least for the last one so he could come in and go niel, niel rierson!
The register light says 2/2, which is Groundhog Day. That must be intentional.
Welp, I just watched a 4min potato chip commerical. Well done.
watch all 7 or 8. all different
Am I the only one who noticed the subliminal message of the $1 on the screen to make us think they only cost $1?
BING!
The background music was how the Sunny and Cheir song was used in Groundhog day.
Pringles still better.
He'll know he's truly gone to hell when she greets him with a British accent:  "Hay, mate!  Look who's got Walkers!"
As creative as these are it’s still undercut by the fact that it’s still a company going “buy our fucking product, you trash”
NED? NED RYERSON?!
Oh i get it! It keeps repeating like that one movie!
nice ending.
Old fashioned barbecue please
Ned Ryerson got stuck in the next level of the Backrooms grocery!
All this needed was a scene at the end showing him leaving the store and Bill Murray calls out to him. "Stephen? Stephen Tobolowsky?! Stephen Tobolosky, I thought that was you!"
I got it on Groundhog Day, but you should have had a finish…
Ok but what did this have to do with Ryan Reynolds?
Where's the ketchup Lay's Ryan? What kind of Canadian are you? The Gin has gone to your head.
Absolutely brilliant
It’s Ned! Ryerson! Needle nose Ned, Ned the head… Good work Walkers… I mean Lays.
The Lay's kept him coming back
Classic
It's me! Ryerson! Ned ryerson, needle nose Ned, Ned the head, ah come on you gotta remember me?... Bing!
Ned? NED RYERSON?!
Stephen Tobolowsky is a national treasure.
Alright stop teasing us and do a sequel!!
Remember Sammy Jankis
Around flavor seven I was wondering how many lays flavors there are and I looked it up, by the end of the video he’s got 312 more to go
WHERE'S THE KETCHUP FLAVOUR? STILL IN  🇨🇦 ONLY ?
Well, I sure as heckfire remember you!
This hits different if you've seen Memento.
Fun video, but Lays sucks. This won’t make me buy ‘em.
Is that Artimus?
What that is it?  Man 4 mins just not long enough.  I think I need to go to the store and get something now.
Perfect Super Bowl ad idea, play these in order throughout the game
I watched this when it aired on tv and i was fuc*ingscared because it started getting weirder and weirder
Bet'cha can't buy just one.
Is that Lauren Ash as the cashier?
Remember Sammy Jankis
"Do you remember me?  'Cause I sure as heck-fire remember you!"
Now I get it!
Groundhog Day 2: Needlenose Ned
Ned... Ned Ryerson?
It’s your turn now Ned.
NPC
Now he knows how it feels!!!  We're not buying your insurance, Ned!!!
"Name's Artemis and I have a bleached asshole."
Jack Barker there has gone from The Box to The Bag
Nice.
I love this so much. Groundhog Day is my favorite. We watch it EVERY Feb 2 😍
Genuinely the best thing in Groundhog Day. <3
What a great commercial! Inspired by the Bill F-ing Murray classic, it takes the clever bent of showcasing the variety of flavors offered - making sense if the guy were trying to break "the cycle" [a DAILY, not even *monthly* one, mind you...g'wan and tell me men don't suffer, too!] by bringing up different bags. Then he tries changing the scenario by buying for the cashier. It may be you simply loved the ad and are getting an appropriately sized kick-back for its spread. But, Ryan, if you were at all involved in conceiving or developing this, then you deserve a *bigger* kick-back, hands down!
Those 2 people  in the commercials are the only people enjoying those playing
Remember Sammy Jankis
And no one said "It's a doozy!" 😔
Keep forgetting Walkers are called Lays everywhere else.
Dormamu, I have come to bargain (Lay's version)
What's with different ads variations everyday? Is he actually starting career as ads director? For Aviation & Mint Mobile I thought it was because Ryan Reynolds is the investor there but these days it became more vary
I have to watch ads to watch an ad😅
Hulu plays these commercials every 5 minutes
I bet somewhere Phil is feeling this is sweet revenge. 😂
NED RYERSON??!!
Now Ned knows how it feels lol
Well, that was almost funny.
BING!
Now h needs to come up with some Ruffles
“I’d like to begin with a simple question. Who was the boss?”
Is deadpool going to Westview?
Bill Murray passed?
Anybody knows he did not pay for those
BING!
They played this damn commercial twice during every commercial break during last Friday's 2-hour 20/20.  I'm so annoyed that I've decided to give up all Lay's products for lent, and I'm not even Catholic.  Layless lent - I'm sure it'll catch on.
"PHIL?!?!" "NED?!?!" *Punches Ned in the face*
4:10 - Her reaction is priceless. “Why yes they do!!!!!”
I think I know how to get out. Just buy Kraft Mac
Suddenly I now have an urge to go out and get Lays’d.
Nice to see that Ned finally got to see what Phil had to go through.
Ryan reynolds: tell you what lays you lay a cool 2 million on my lap and I'll make 20 lays commercials
BING!
The best Groundhog Day reference is and will always be the Jeep® ad that William F. Murray did. 🥳🤓🏆🦫
I absolutely hate Lay's chip but you need to try dipping original Lay's in ketchup. It's amazing 👌
Another Ryan Reynolds invention to get you watching... and watching...and watching.  Very creative yet again.
First time I saw a Sabritas bag of chips, I though I was in another dimension :)
It would have been awesome if the last one had Bill Murray with a new flavor behind him
Groundhog day sequel with Stephen.
Action Jack Barker!
Bing!
Damn, TLDW and went straight to the end. I hope Deadpool 3 isn’t going to be this “funny”.
was I the only one who thought she was saying “the store just won’t close”??
Wow that was so good
Acute idea but I think it kind of missed the mark. They could've gone for a bigger punchline (or bigger punchlines all the way along). Somewhere, somehow, they should've, of course, had a groundhog (!!?). I'd say they missed the mark on that one big time.  Again though, cute idea and cool to see ST again! And again :-)
For those of you who don’t know, the guy guy in this clip was Ned from the movie Groundhog’s Day, a movie where Bill Murray’s character relives the same day over and over again.
I’d pay for this to be ground hog day 2
This is dumb as hell and it's been done. I get you have kids to feed but damn dude
I love Tobolowsky. I worked on a low budget film with him 10 years ago and he was such a pro; no ego, friendly and when the camera rolled, he gave it his all on each take.
Schoulve just gotten Doritos instead .
ARTEMIS!!!!  love her!
Why are commercials showing up in my YouTube premium feed?
Is anyone else watching this while eating a bag of Lays?
This makes me realize that I would 100% watch another Groundhog Day movie with Ned Ryerson.
Watch out for that aisle 5, its a doozy
Where can I find this grocery store?  It has actual cashiers at the checkouts?  Not the usual 12 self serve checkouts, and 14 cashier checkouts available with only 1 open!🤣
I'm easily amused. I only needed 2.
The best thing about Stephen Tobolowsky is that he inspired David Byrne's song Radio Head, which, in turn, inspired the band's name.
this is a fucking ad
Imagine if he grabbed some Doritos.
sheep
Action Jack Barker strikes again.
Well the acting was phenomenal  even if its kinda torture to watch stuff like this
I wonder if he is still selling insurance.
Stephen is great I’d watch anything if I knew he was in it 🤷‍♂️
This is a great commercial.   I watched the whole thing and sent it to friends.   Smart!!
I'll go to the wall for Stephen Tobolowsky every time, the man is a legend.
It's a commercial, but damn the acting is fantastic.
How fitting that a guy from Dallas is doing a commercial for Frito-Lay! 😀
Damn it, I've never felt so sold out before 😂
This Commercial Ad Should've Been Popping Up Last Week, Before The Holiday. Thank You.
Brilliant commercial on multiple levels.  Great play on 'Groundhog Day' (both the phrase and the movie), and manages to advertise multiple flavors/products while being entertaining!
i swear they need to make a Groundhog day 2.0  and just re-release the original Groundhog day, LOL
I can imagine one day he'll finally get through that exit door and think he's free... Only to find out he's in the UK now and has to go through all of it again with their sister brand Walkers 😂
Already boycotting Pepsi/Lay's, guess it's time to boycott Ryan Reynolds and Stephen Tobolowsky for this garbage trying to cash in on a classic movie.
Don't you have enough money to where you don't have to shill for Lays lol.  And of course this video gets recommended to me in the algorithm.  Cause now the content is the ad these days.    Stop being a ho for corporations.  it isn't a good look
Bing!  Ned Ryerson!!
Holy crap.
Does he still sell insurance?
Artemis hell ya
Ned? Ned Ryerson? Needle-nose Ned? Is that you? Ooh, you've got Lays. You know, those Lays just keep me comin' back....
This is an awesome promotional spot. Ned is now trapped in the world of repeat. This is an awesome promotional spot. Ned is .............. no I won't.
ARTEMIS!!!
I wish more commercials were this threatening lol
did ryan put his grindr pic in the info section? oops 🙂
This is amazing 😂
When it comes to character actors, Stephen Tobolowsky is a legend.
I did think the till number would get higher, denoting how many times he was reliving the day.
House the beef.
Wait a minute. Is that... NED? RYERSON?!? OMFG It is!!!  Needle Nose Ned! Ned the Head!! BING!!!
Can someone explain - when there is a frontal shot of the guy with chips, they are obviously fake, non-glossy (maybe even cgi) bag, however, when he puts them down on the line, they are real glossy bag. Why would they do that?
LOL another great thing from the mind of Ryan Reynolds.  Love the ending :D
Did Ryan's buddy Trudeau approve this commercial? I'm sure he had some of the tax payers money involved in this.
The guy with the mop was able to get out somehow.
This is great. The change each time is perfect sequencing. Whoever the lady playing the cashier is, she did a terrific job. Thanks for the entertainment. Love Lays.
Stephen Tobolowsky is a treasure.
I don't know why, but i now have a craving for doritos.
Hahahah, was he shopping at Omega Mart in Vegas..
Clever ,clever , clev , cl , c ……
Best goddam advert I've ever seen, and I don't mind saying that again!
Be honest, who skipped the commercials while watching these commercials?
I watched this while eating walkers! And I just keep coming back
Ned????
Wow
Beginning to end: Perfection. And I love that the ultimate ad is showcasing how many flavors there are. Sorry, Tobolowsky! See you never!
guess Ned Riderson is having his own groundhog day after pestering Phil Connors
no one talks like this but fun vid i guess
Maybe don't pick up lays and u can leave..... but then the wife be like "where's my lays!? I sent you for one thing!"
There's only two things I want to know:  First, what some of these Lay's flavors taste like. I guess I'm boring, and have only tried like two flavors of Lay's potato chips. I've tried more Pringles flavors.  Second, how did Ned Ryerson get Mimic blood combined with his blood?
Ned? Ryerson?
How much did they pay you for this
Groundhog day should be an Anthology set of movies, each one in a different genres, where main character(s) reacts different to the situation (thriller, murder mystery, gore/slasher..)
U could go to another register 😂
After the second one I kept looking in the background to see if I could find Ryan, no luck
Ryan does the best ads.
Don’t drive angry 😡
So Ned ended up in hell...
Ned? NED RYERSON??
Phil!?
😮 *Is that Ned? Ned Ryerson?!!!!! Ned the Head? Needle Nose Ned?!* I hope he remembers me cause I sure as shootin' remember him!! 🤣😂😁🤗
I would start showing up with Pringles or Cheetos just to see her reaction.
Now I want some lays
Well that’s 4 minutes I’ll never get back.  Also - no one carries chips like that.
Sammy ..its time for my shot
This reminds me of Episode 6 of season 2 of Loki
I was hoping to see him walk up dressed as Clint Eastwood's character in The Good The Bad and The Ugly.
Ned? NED RYERSON??
This has to have lore in it
i feel like the only way to exit the loop is to NOT get Lays and this customer will never figure that out
I never got why companies don't make more ads that are engaging like this.
hahahahahha, we don't get all those flavors in Argentina, but we do with Pringles. :D
Average NPC interaction in video games
I guess Needle Nose Ned lost his Whistling Belly Button gig
Meh. They don't make 'm like they used to. They don't do it for me anymore. I won't be coming back for more. The flavor has already been gone for days.
Best commercial
NED??? NED REYERSON?
I want a food theory about this. There’s some LOOOOOORE in there!
This is some ridiculously good marketing. Like I am unironically baffled. AND I want some plain Lay’s now. Actually sold me the product in a clever way, like back in the old days? I love it!
have not watched an ad this good in a whilee
Nobody carries a bad of crisps like that everrrr 😂 and I swear this guys living a Groundhog Day of the teacher in everything
BING!!!
Brilliant! Kudos to the actor playing the cashier.
It's like free guy 😂    Wait, was that intentional?
And no ketchup chips, weird for a canuck to not include ketchup chips
Brilliant! =)  Groundhog Day is one of my all time favorite movies. Lay's did a good thing here. =)  Edit: Ehhh is Ryan the creative genius behind this commercial? In that case Lay's still did a good thing hiring him. =)
Poor guy. Isn't there some kind of insurance against that?
I understand most of your other products. But GMO seed oil garbage? Bro, you put your name to THIS?
That last scene's a doozy!
NED?  NED RYERSON?!?!?!
Bravo!
This was better than an actual lays commercials
🌻
Ned? Ned Ryerson?
No Ketchup flavour?  And Ryan calls himself a Canadian.   Canadian indeed.  Good day sir 🧐
The bit at the very end was brilliant. Shot this from an 8 to a 10.
Artemis?! And Ned Ned Ryerson?! 😂
Ohh lookie who’s got Lays!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They named Walkers Crisps wrong again.   Silly Americans.
How my cashier must view me every week with my chips. Too relatable, but not Lays. BTW The sexual innuendo. Until the guy realizes it's not.
Ending was pretty funny, otherwise meh. Good premise tho
This is brilliant. On so many levels. I love that Stephen Tobolowsky is in this. I love the writing. I love the comedy. I have never been so satisfied with a commercial.
Great fun! He only had a few scenes in Groundhog Day, but he made a real impression. Well, actually, he had several scenes..........I mean, it was the same scenes but they just...........like that one scene on the street with Bill Murray, except it was several scenes...........I need to lie down.............
Did I really just intentionally watch a 4 minute ad?
Ryan not only made me watch a commercial, he made me watch 10. ... And I'd watch 10 more for you, boss.
Don't let Disney bully you Mr. Reynolds! We need this level of quality media in our lives, and in our Deadpool 3 experience! From a fan: much love!
Only man who can make me watch a commercial. And he is not even in it.
If market people are reading this. It didn’t work! I had to explain the joke to all ages of the people watching this on February 2nd. Nobody noticed the flavors (bags) was changing because they were on their phones. Plus the movie is over 20 years old. I’ll probably buy Utz, anyways.
Not all Boomer offspring are Millennials. My mother had a Gen-X and much younger Millennials. The Gen-X faced end,ess economic setbacks and the Millennial is so self absorbed and shallow that the mere fact of us aging and having health problems means we’re iced out and barely allowed to see his kids. He won’t be there for either of us as we age and his wife has wiped out my mom’s savings because she basically had to provide money, gifts, groceries, and free childcare to see the grandkids. To fund this, Mom kept refinancing the house. She sold last year during the boom. Even though the house was worth 6x what they paid for it in the ‘80s,  she sold it at a net loss, but is too dumb to realize it because it technically was a 50% profit. She gave up a locked in monthly housing cost, a two-digit annual 1980s property tax, and warm weather to rent in a red state with harsh winters.   While some Boomers did save, invest, and plan…I suspect my mim’s poor decisions aren’t unique and the crisis you speak of will be far worse because even Boomers who seem to have a home and apparent stability may have squandered their good fortune beyond what is readily apparent.
This is awful, by every metric known to mankind. I see what you are doing there.
I need this to happen for all of the flavors and each kind I need more comedy until deadpool 3
“Sammy, it’s time for my shot”
Magic masala>>>>>>>>
Ryan Reynolds' ads are so funny! This is a great idea.
Tobo is our King!
Ned? Ned Ryerson?!
When Bill says know, you ask Ned.
Ryan should've got Bill Murray it would've been funnier
He just needs to find and seduce Andie McDowell, that's the Exit!
Stephen’s a great character actor! Love to see him still acting!
What does Ryan own Lays now too?
Can you just make all ads?
WTF did I just watch?
I found these ads creepy. I will never buy Lay's potato chips again. Horrible commercials!
Ned?! Ryerson!!?!?!
Artemis!!! From Scandal & Superstore!! Love her!
Where’s the lays made with sweet potato
🥰
Now do the one WITH THEIR STUNT DOUBLES!!!
That reference to Loki with time is genius, and color matching number 2. You must be kidding. Ryan I camehere for a treat.EASTEREAGGSSS
3:24 ok it took me until here to realize she said the drawer just wont close. I kept hearing the store just won't close like it's her own personal hell. Stuck repeating the same lines over and over and aware it's happening but unable to do anything but continue with the repetition. A bit of The Good Place vibe.
Man they didn't even touch Salt and Vinegar....
Principal Ball & Lunch lady Doris
Who's Ryan Reynolds? 🤔 Is he the bald guy?
Absolutely brilliant
*Me:* "Is this a funny skit pretending to be a commercial for potato chips, or is it actually really a commercial for potato chips?" *Ryan Reynolds:* "Yes."
Watch out for that register, it’s a doozy!
REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS
This reminds me of just how ugly It's Always Sunny makes their characters. Artemis is rough in the show, but the actress is very pretty in this lol
Whose the boss? Whats happening?
Ruffles > Lays
The commercial has become self aware! Abort! ABORT!
Given that Phil was trapped for potentially 10 millennium, how long will Ned be trapped in that store?
Ryan Reynolds Copperfeild bringing us wry humor every today , like magic, since 2011's, " Green Lantern "
I had to comment. This is the work of a genius!
I have a hankering for potato chips now... Lays potato chips!
When does he get intimate with a groundhog? That's what we're here for right?
Poor Ned.
So good 😅
I can't believe I just watched a commercial by my own free will. For the record, I go out of my way to block ads on the youtube app.
I dont eat Lays, because I only like to eat one chip.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this is hell
Just remember he also created the 4 TRIGANGLES TO SUCCESS LMAFO.
Mikele ate Lays 17 times
He was originally cast as the Tool Time co-host Glen. But due to scheduling conflicts, couldn't make it in for taping. So it went to Richard Karn as Al Borland
This is art and a greaf concept for a series/movie.
Needle nose Ned getting a taste of more than Lay’s
Hey Lay's! Come back to Australia and bring back Tazos
The other day I sent a gif to my husband, with Phil and the groundhog, with "Don't drive angry."
Why doesn’t he just go to a different checkout clerk? 🛒
Umm… …this makes me not want to have Lays actually.
lol
You know you wish you were in a movie like Groundhog Day, eh Mr. reynolds?  Only thing missing on these is that cat meowrr sound he makes in the movie. Classic.
Wow. The Company that made this commercial printed all the types of Lays on vinyl prop bags just for this commercial.
I like how even the mysic got distorted.  And goddammit, Ryan... did you just make me watch a 5 min Lay's commercial?
Ned... Ned Ryerson?! Bing!
NED?!
i'm just waiting for her to tell him that she's got a bleached asshole
Why does he keep coming back to the store if he's clearly frustrated about it!!?
The "clean-up on aisle 5" voice changes.
If only they had Kathryn Hahn to be the cashier
Stephen Tobolowsky does not age.  Proof he's stuck in a time loop.
I was expecting him to punch her lights out, on the last ad. But you can't hit a woman, so...  Probably should have cast Bill Murray  as the cashier. 🤣
We need a 10hr version
This guy could scratch at paint all day.
Artemis!!!
That was fantastic 👏.
This is good but why does he keep going to lane #2
The flaming hot are the best! Glad they ended there
He never paid for the dill chips before walking out, damn shoplifter!
If he wants out, all he has to do is decompress the main shuttle bay instead of using the tractor beam.  Works every time.
WE NEED MORE LORE 😢❤❤
Clever.
This is the best advertisement for Lays lmao
🤣🤣 awsome
Dammint. Now I want Lays chips. All of them.
Bing! I sure as heckfire love Lay's potato chips. They are a "do-ooo-ooo-zee"!  They should have had the checkout lady say quotes from the movie.
ad featuring a liminal store? Nice
I want to work at Ryan’s marketing company!
i already adapted this film to a convenience store, so
Phil?!? Phil Connors?!? I thought that was you! Hey, hey! Now, don't you tell me you don't remember me because I sure as heckfire remember you.
This was terrifying and incredible all at the same time.
Artemis looks awesome!
Did he age??
Bing!... Bing again!
I hope he does eat them 😮 I just realise he never pays for them
My name is Werner Brandis, my voice is my passport, verify me.
Lays really do apply the conjoined triangles of success, now that I think about it.
Needle Nose Ned FTW
Thanks a lot Ryan, I thought I was over my lay's addiction and now you pulled me right back in
This was an awesome Groundhog Lays chips compilation!
"and wait until we start in on the Asian flavors: shrimp, squid, so many wonderful options"
Haruhi Suzumiya would never...
Ah, yes.  The manufacture of new Lay's flavors, the sales of those flavors... all part of the Conjoined Triangles of Success
Ned, Ned Ryerson!
Ned?!  Ned Ryerson?!
*walkers
I prefer Ruffles.
Ned?  Ned Ryerson? 👊💥
Classic....A nod to Ned...
Am I the only one who kept watch waiting for salt and vinegar only to be disappointed? ☹️
Ad-supported ads. What a time to be alive.
...also "my voice is  my passport" . heh
It's so impressive they managed to make it as bad and cringy as the original! You just wanna punch m in the face.
Gives me Great Choice vibes: Person trapped in a food commercial, repeating a loop that gets slightly different as they realise that something’s off
This commercial is GENIOUS !!
This Lays commercial was a doozy!
That’s so Ned! Phil learns piano and French poetry. Ned just decides to try every flavor of lays.
Love these! Watched Groundhog Day for the umpteenth time last night. Never fails to make me laugh.😂 😂😂
this was great, well done all involved
ryan reynolds i love you
"Get your damn hands off my Lets"
To be fair hellish repetition is what most ads and all customer service jobs feel like. You could trap any cashier in a time-loop and it might be months before they notice.
🤣😂😅🥲😥😰😓😢😭😱🤯
This isn't a potato chip commercial montage, this is the inner working monologue for how Ryan Reynolds sees himself and his acting career.
Ned? Ned Ryerson?!?! Bing!!!
Bing!
Love this
I always knew Stephen Tobolowsky had a smouldering anger under that deadpan exterior.
Bing!
ARTEMIS!!! RECOGNIZE THAT VOICE ANYWHERE... ITS ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA
Brilliant ad. 😂
He the devil !!!!
Ned Ryerson got Ned Ryerson'd.
This is in 4 years when our Kroger VR app can’t find reliable WiFi
Why wasn't this already a thing?
Ryan really is the only man in all of human history that will get me to willingly watch the entire ad because you need to see how it ends
This is genius 😂
Brilliant
Ned!!
On the first one I thought she said "this store just won't close"... how right I (almost) was!
The hell is artemis gonna do with those lays.
I could really go for some Tostedos corn chips about now.
This video just kept me coming back
I bet this one was a doozy!
omg ryan, its a leap year, 365 days this time around lol
Freaking genius
Brilliant!  I always wondered what happened to Ned Ryerson ! GHD is one of my best films.... Best, so really appreciate this!
Why didn't he just try a different till
One of the best pay offs ever, bravo.
Your genius astounds me. You're the unofficial official spokesthing of Canada!
Groundhog flavour 😂
LOL thanks lays. this was fun...wait, Wyan Reynolds posted it????? waaaaa
This is brilliant! And the music changes make it even better.
Artemis, my love, where have you been??
Ned?
I'll never buy a Lays product again because of this annoying commercial loop, All. Day. Long.
Why is Ryan posting ads????
Ned!!??
Remember how Sammy Jenkis likes his chips
Artemis and her bleached butthole...
And now I wish I had some lays chips
I love this commercial. It's a DOOZY!
Ryan and his marketing team just know how to do it
Did I just watch a 4 min commercial? I'd like to think this is a probable sequel to the original film
Are we in hell? 😂 Omg this was great
First 3-4 was for fun……. All the rest was just because your already invested and you have to see it thru to the bitter end. 😁
Ryan!!! we NEED your God Tier Advertising in Newegg! heck just buy out the business and take over your own tech company first then advertise them into the stratosphere XD
Attention: Deadpool 3 is around the corner.  Lays, the official chip of Deadpool, the savior of the Marvel multiverse!
She reminds me of amy poehler style
Release the worldwide every flavor cut
We need in Deadpool 3 this playing out in the background with Deadpool breaking the loop.
This would have been PERFECT for the Superbowl
I just had to grab the last bag out of the vending machine here at work. Thanks, Deeppool...
😂  Why did I watch till the end 😂😂😂
When will they stop raping everything from our childhoods for a quick buck? Greed and lack of originality have really killed the creative arts. They can't come up with anything new so they find lame ways to nostalgia bait people. Pathetic and not funny. Insurance sales must be slow for Ned Ryerson.
Maybe  its teasing  somthing thats coming
👏👏👏
"Flavors For Days"  Missed opportunity... "Lay's For Days"
Ryan reynolds channel has just become the greatest advert channel on youtube. Man that guys' a marketing genius
Bing!
Saw these commercials on 'GMA' 3 Feb 24.... At First, I thought I was watching just a regular commercial, when I saw the same one again.  Nothing major except several minutes later I saw for a Third time..... "wait a minute, is this the same commercial??"   Having a DVR I spun it back and noticed that the bag had changed and a small difference in costumer reaction as "boy with rolling pail" rolled by and different attitude at cashier, then cashier says something different with each flavor.  Saw the 4th, 5th, and 6th.....then as I was waking up, I realized it was "Groundhog Day", so I also "recorded it".  Then, I was "LOSING IT" when I saw the 7th and 8TH ones.....clearly was thinking ........... how far is this going to go??  Well after almost an Hour on 'GMA', they started repeating the 1st one and after the second one....I just turned off the TV, but Not after I showed it to my daughter, who said, "Meh" and then my wife after work.......same reaction.  But I kinda enjoyed it.
It was the second last one before I realised her name tag says Lulu, which is my name.
Yo, is that Artemis? You know, Sweet Dee's friend....
Hmmm
Now I'll associate Lays chips with H e l l
Whose the cashier?
Bing!
Rise and shine wood chuck-chuck-chuckers...
Well done!!
Oh my gosh!! Lays nailed it!! Absolutely genius!! Love it!
Bing!
You just Bud Lighted yourself. Never buy Lay's again.
More like the STORE just won't close.
Ned? Ned Ryerson?? 😂😂😂 Watch out! That first step is a doozy!
So smart! 😂🎉 ❤
Ned RYERSONNNN!!!
This is always something that makes me crack up
This is actually the way they could have made a sequel, have another main person from the movie go through a groundhog day experience but in a completely different way.
Pretty pretty good.
and I’ll say it again 😂
Harold Ramis would be proud...
Imagine what she could do with a bag of those Flamin Hots in a dumpster behind Wendy's.
I wouldn’t mind living a Groundhog Day if it meant I could watch Deadpool 3 over and over again.
Deja vu, the sensation that you are doing something you have done before.  Deja vu, the sensation that you are doing something you have done before.  Deja vu, the sensation that you are doing something you have done before.  Deja vu…
That last bit really threw out the idea that it was merely a time loop.  It's actually the bad place!
this guy is eating one bag of chips per day
Again.
He was also a hilarious Seinfeld guest star!
Touché GREAT GREAT GREAT EXCELLENT MARKETING!!! And Thank you 😂
Ooh they make Veggie Poppables?!  Perhaps there is hope yet.
👑❤️‍🔥🔥🍾🥂
Watch out for that first step, it’s a DOOZIE
I just wish Lay's didn't turn to price gouging and start charging more than double what a bag used to be.
Omg!  An amazing gift for us on Groundhog’s Day.
What's truly genius was that they got Sammy Jankis to do this!
This is horrifying. XD
Can anyone read her name tag? That has to be part of the joke as well.
My first thought was, is that you Artemis?
I love u ryan but give up on wrex dude
That commercial got dark...like Lay's BBQ flavoured chips...That commercial got dark...like Lay's BBQ flavoured chips...That commercial got dark...like Lay's BBQ flavoured chips...That commercial got dark...like Lay's BBQ flavoured chips...That commercial got dark...like Lay's BBQ flavoured chips...That commercial got dark...like Lay's BBQ flavoured chips...That commercial got dark...like Lay's BBQ flavoured chips...
The actress is great as well. Anyone know her name?
Action Jack is at it again.
Brilliant marketing strategy. I didn't know what the hell was going on at first. The first commercial I saw during General Hospital was when Ned and the cashier were speaking at the same time. The cashier looked confused but Ned had clearly been there before. Then I got the joke. Bravo to you Mr. Reynolds and your marketing partners. 👏🏽
This ad has Laysers
Entertaining short, but I am exactly zero percent more likely to buy Lays chips.
Kudos to everyone involved in making this.   I was watching General Hospital today without knowing anything about this and just stumbled onto the ads.  Just brilliant.  You guys did put the maximum effort into this.  💯  Now do a Season 2.
I love how the music changes tempo every time
They're called Walker's
My theory: that's Phil's sister Mary Pat at the cash register.
Would have been slightly better with Bill Murray
I wish Phil Conners could have witnessed Ned Ryerson on his Lays repeat 😂
Bing!
I haven’t been this invested in a commercial storyline since long long man
Aaaah Michael! You successfully hit the metal 17 times
This was way too funny.  Since the 1st one  started at 7am this morning. 😂😂😂
I may never purchase Lays again.
I totally forgot it was groundhogs day, thanks Ryan!
So what did Ned do to be put in a loop
Hilarious...
Haven't i seen this before
Artemis!
Absolutely Brilliant! Glad to see Mr. Tobolowsky is still going strong.
What is happening with this commercial????
Phil!? Phil Connors!?
😂
There is a theory that it all started with Ned Reyerson, once he was nice to him and bought all the insurance, the rest came easy, be kind to your old classmates??
!!!
You know, that store could really benefit from Jack Barker's Conjoined Triangles of Success
They dated each other on a season of Californication! Runkle!
I KNEW IT! She was in on it the whole time!!
The true man
He didn’t once try selling her insurance. Impressive!
Dammit, Reynolds.  First it was 2 Guys a Girl and a Pizza now you have me watching commercials. And liking it.  Ryan must be stopped.
I just couldn’t stop watching… I keep coming back again and gain, and again and…
"how can we show the full range of lays chips in one ad and still make it fun... go!" Very cool!
Man I want some lays all of a sudden
😆
Is that Artemis????
Funny series but I think the Jeep Gladiator commercial with Bill taking the groundhog for some fun is better.  And this guy is it that too!
Hm.
😂😂😂creepy and funny
For the love of all that is good. Get other groceries!!
I was waiting on her to call her manager and Bill Murray pop up.
This was fantastic🙌😂
i just clicked on an ad, willingly
Who is the actress at the checkout counter??!!! I can't figure it out 😅
Lays. Have your Phiiiiiiiiil!
Scary... and also funny.  Color me intrigued...
🤣🤣🤣 bit bittersweet, but... 😆😆😆😆
Disappointed the YouTube ad at the end wasn't for Lay's.
Why is this on  Ryan's channel?
Laughing so hard I forgot it was a commercial.  Great job!
Hands down the best 4 minutes and 11 seconds of my life
This is brilliant!  Stephen Tobolowsky was the perfect choice for this.
Love the actors, but wwwaaayyyy too long for a mild joke. I could have edited that down to a minute and it would have worked.
Remember Sammy Jankis
lol  His own private Hell loop.
Man, the fake laugh is so bad. Aren't you guys actors or something?
Artemis!
I wish Murray would show up like ned ive missed you so much
Sorry, I LOVE Ryan Reynolds but why is no one asking why this is on his channel?? Dear Ryan, people watch stuff you upload - if we give you loads of money, will you upload ten of our adverts? Yours sincerely, Lays.  Dear Lays, thank you for the money.
Bill murray would have preferred to get stuck in a department store
Ned Ryerson!
Netflix : "Write it down, we can make a spin-off out of this !"
Phil!
See ... now what would have been a nice touch is if the number on the till changed with what loop they were in.
Someone understood the assignment, and someone aced it.
Great idea to remind us of a legendary movie  ❤
Thank you sir, for the unexpected laugh this morning.
Oh look its Jack Barker. Wheres the Conjoined Triangles of Success ?
I need to get Lay's....ed
👍☮️🇨🇦
The cashier is turning into Beverly Goldberg 😂😂
Im Being Tortured With These Rn Please Send Help For Me And My Mom
That was awesome
advertising genius, whoever thought this up deserves a huge bonus.
2/2 - nice!
I stuck with this all the way through to the ned
Forget the commercial, I want some of those flavors here in the Netherlands!
why did i just watch an ad for lays over and over and over again
I SURVIVED THE ENDLESS EIGHT!!!
Lots of lays. You also love it, isn’t it so, Ryan? Keep coming back!😉🤫👍
Oh god 😂 best commercial with a story i've ever seen and i mean it
I like it.   Thank you.
This is priceless.
Ned ? Ned Ryerson ?????
Artemis!!!
So about the ad.  We're going to tie your brand to an existential crisis that will crush a man and, by extension, demonstrate the endless treadmill all of our lives have become. ... Sorry, I was distracted but that sounds great!  Run with it!
Ryan Reynolds, king of the short advertisements lol
That's your typical shopper's experience...lol. Bill Murray me @RyanReynolds
Bro is stuck in Edge of Tommorow
Kill me. Damn, those CGI Lays pics look appalling.
NED!
did the lady voice ida the owl lady
Basically my life
Lay's? More like getting Laid! I am I right?! I mean, that'll keep me coming back. 😉
Action Jack Backer!! Mr. Conjoined Triangle of Success. 😂
Well I sure as heckfire remember you!! Ned Ryerson! Bing! Needlehead Ned! Bing!
Watching from Germany 😂 there's a Cheddar flavour?!?!
ngl. I initially read something different into that title
Is that Artemis??? If so, she be looking good.
It’s a doozy….
Ned??????
Fun fact: he dated my sister Mary Pat a couple times until I told him not to anymore. Watch out for that first step!
Where were the Ketchup or the All Dressed flavors? Swing and a miss on that low hanging fruit.
He won’t be coming back when he sees how expensive they are now. 😢
Notice the music getting less peppy ad by ad
I was waiting for him to say that drawer is a doozy.
well...I had a feeling it was going to be a long ride of a treat. Thanks for fukin implanting the lays brand so deep into my neocortex. FU @Ryan Reynolds.
Am i the only one who heard this store just won’t close instead of drawer??😭😭
Awesomeness
Is that Artemis from It’s Always Sunny?
Fuck you @ryanreynolds you goddamn genius. Fuck. You. For making me watch all these ads. Now I want chips.
I love how the supermarket music gets more slower and depressive
bro... such a puddle to step in.  6.9/10.
Ned?! 🤜
Meanwhile in South Africa with our 5 flavours............
Never thought I’ll be watching Edge of tomorrow-esque ad
I seriously wouldn’t zone out commercials as much if they all had slight variations every time you saw them. This is genius!
These Ryan Reynolds ads just keep me comin' back!
FLAVORS FOR DAYS
Click baited again and again... no regrets.
So, I'm gonna guess.... Lays made these as a series of superbowl ads, but it was gonna cost WAAAAAAAY too after having Captain Tofino punch up the writing. They spent so much on  Vancouver Batman there wasn't enough budget to to air the whole thing... So they hired Maple Spice to run the ad on his YT channel to try and get Google to pay a bit of the difference.   (Jokes made with much love from Onterrible)
Steven is a lot taller than I thought
well done
I feel like don drapper would have really nailed into his crew the “flavour for days” theme requirement and ended up with this is commercial
Free Palestine.
#FreePalestine
dammit Ryan. Every time U post, i'm teleported to watch the post LIKE IT'S GROUNDHOG DAY!
HAPPY METEOROLOGICAL PROGNOSTICATING ALBINO RODENT DAY!!
Was watching Memento Yesterday, was expecting Sammy to not realize where he was at first!
How to sell chips, just ask Ryan Reynolds, that man is a GOLD mine!!!
See you in Deadpool trailer boss.
Now I know how Dormammu felt fighting Dr. Strange.
I made it AAAAAAAALLLLLL the way through. Just for your Ryan Reynolds. Just for you!
He's in time loop
Lays chips would go great with watching the Edmonton Elks CFL team that you should buy.
Not doing Salt & Vinegar is a crime.
Stephen Tobolowsky is one of the most talented and underrated/underappreciated actors.
He hasn't even gotten to the international flavors. That's where you unlock the shrimp flavors.
flavors for days! now there are 8 days a week now!! xD
Thank god they ran out of film!!
I missed "Silicon Valley".. Sadly they end entire series  :(
Tobo!
Sammy Jankis was the only one who remembered for once
Bing!
There have been many commercials where someone could have said "Am I in Hell?"   I'm glad they waited until this one to use it on.
Oh Ned Ryerson, always riding the Möbius. You so craaazee 😅
It’s Ned.
Now finally Ned understands Phil's pain, and he gets to experience it over and over again.
Cuántos sabores de lay’s tienen? Acá sólo hay dos y son muy caros 😢🫠
Phuk you Ryan Reynolds!  Phuk Lay's and I only watched 2 commercials!  😂
Layed a clear path…Puntatotastic!
Mr. Tobolowsky is SO TALL. I couldn't tell that in Groundhog Day.
Watching these ad while I eat my Lay's BBQ chips is the best. We demand more Stephen Tobolowsky!
It was annoying after the 3rd one. Lays taste like ass.
I thought this was a deadpool 3 reference
Can ryan and his company take over all hollywood productions?
Great serial commercials. Should've been saved for the Super Bowl!
Ned Ryerson??? Ryan you are an absolute genius my man.
They gotta make a groundhogs 2 with Ned as the protagonist!! They could even use lays and all their flavors! I wouldn't care!! Plus the chick from always sunny. Reynolds and Rob could team up and make it super funny!  They know each well already. 😁
That was so annoying I couldn't stop watching... 😂
One lays once, one lays with all. #heavenstartedatveggiePoppables
I kept thinking, "it's only 4 minutes long...they won't do all the flavors...right?"   Meanwhile, in hell:
Tobolowsky!!!!  And Artemis.....
I love Groundhogs Day but is anybody else waiting for Frank Reynolds to come take the chips so him and Artemis can bang out back in the dumpster?
Did i just watched a 4 min long commercial cause i want to see the ending ?? i got jebaited.
I think I want some lays for whatever reason
Artemis Pebdani absolutly killed it as the casher, Lulu. MAD Kathryn Hahn vibes. Bubbly, confident, and just the right amount of sinister. Awesome casting.
😂😂😂😂😂 maestro
Best damn commercial (s) I've seen in years.  I need to buy me a bag of the newer flavors.
Fuck you Lays!     Fuck you Ryan!  Your marketing totally worked!   I'm gonna go watch Groundhog Day again!      While snacking on....  ....delicious....  ....crispy....  ....well-seasoned....  Old Dutch Potato Chips!
Artemis Pebdani is freaking fantastic in this. Even though its just the same lines she makes it epic. I adored her on Scandal.
Strange... I've got a hankering to go listen to "I Got You Babe" now (and eat some chips).
NED! Ryerson! "Needlenose Ned"? "Ned the Head"? Come on, buddy. Case Western High. Ned Ryerson: I did the whistling belly-button trick at the high school talent show? Bing! Ned Ryerson: got the shingles real bad senior year, almost didn't graduate? Bing, again. Ned Ryerson: I dated your sister Mary Pat a couple times until you told me not to anymore? Well?
This is mild af
needle nose ned
NED?!
NED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💢👊💪💢👋💪BING!!!💢👊💪💢👋💪BING AGAIN!!!!!
What did the bag of chips say to the battery? If you're Eveready, I'm Frito-Lay
What a fantastic concept! Now I want Lay’s
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Definitely not a true Canadian commercial. No Ketchup.
Its a Dooooooozy
He never pays.
I hope to see these during the super bowl
i want ess ee ex with ryan...
Ned, Ned ryerson!
Tobes is the best.
No #Ruffles No Thanks.
#BillMurray is a friend of mine. Mr. Reynolds you're NO #BillMurray. Missing #AndieMcDowell.
Biiiiiiiiiiinnng!!!!
Weewoo
Best commercial that makes you wonder... Do they want me to buy them
Why is blud posting a commercial for a brand he doesn't own referencing a movie he wasn't in
Is That Artemis?
Perfect!
Even Lulu's name is a repeat. Probably a little side-gag. Isle 2 maybe too!
Bill Murray must be rolling over in his...oh wait.
Phil.. Phil Connors!
So she's in on it. He might actually be in hell. Poor guy
Very cool!
The commercial is Grrrrrr.rrrrr.rrr.r reat!
There has to be a crew behind Ryan making this all happen. He is not that lucky.
Credit to the producers. They did a great job of making this look like a Pennsylvanian grocery store. I’ve never been to one in or around Punxsutawney, but this is what all the generic grocery stores here look like. Happy Groundhogs day, everybody.
This is peak advertising. The first commercial that I was sad because it was over.
Did Ryan buy a controlling stake in Lays?
This is what happens when your mind breaks from strain caused by the conjoined triangles of success.
But where's Ryan Reynolds though? 🤔
Flipping yankton cocsukr
Brilliant commercial concept 😂😂😂
Why is it that I skip every YouTube ad I see within 5 seconds if it'll let me and yet here I am, not only clicking to see this ad, but actually sitting through 8 variations of it? And enjoying it? What have you done to my Ryan Reynolds?!?
Ned's losing his bing'ing mind
Kinda disappointed he didn't slap her in one take.. :/
Maximum effort - commercials I hurry to watch- on purpose.
It would get old. However, it would be great for a while! Eating whatever he wanted from the supermarket and in whatever quantities! He wouldn’t gain weight. Heck, he wouldn’t even have to floss!
Groundhog Day 2 looks amazing.
BING!  I love sitting through commercials to watch commercials.
You know, Ryan, I used to like you. 😉🙃
Raise your hand if you watched all of these hoping something interesting would happen.
So how much did RR invest in Lay's? 🤔
Watching this with the closed caption on makes the series of commercials even funnier.
This would make a good Superbowl spot, spread out across the course of the day.
NO. They're not even half full. It's like buying air. Gaddamit.
Guess it's time to buy some lay's
I think I took too many shrooms...
Looks like Lays is buying ALL the SuperBowl commercial time :D
Ned, Ned Ryerson!
Watch out for that next step. It's a doozy!
This feels like wanda vision
Ned???
Telling my kid this was a Heroes Season 2 deleted scene
Go to a different register.
ugghhhh.... ryan reynolds 4:11minutes youtube unskipable ad. my adblock perfectly work but now doesnt work bro...
Took me till the end to notice the 2 sign was 2-2, Groundhog Day. Slick.
Brilliantly hilarious!! 😂
Brilliant! Oh, and did I just watch a four minute Lays commercial? Which reminds me, I need to pick up some Lays at the store tomorrow.
😁😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆💋💖🌵👵🐺🖖🍟🍿🤷
Lay's really knows how to team up with a creative team for this one.
took to long to get to the Flaming hot... but it was worth it.
Remember sammy jenkins
This is most certainly for the Super Bowl
Lays , I got you Lays .
Missed opportunity to use the Sonny and Cher song in the background
Finally, commercials are good again! 🤣🤣
*RYERSON!*
😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏
Jack Barker in Wanda Hex for sure
I think you've invented a new genre: meta shill.
There's a different voice every "Clean up on 5"
Haha feels like WandaVision 😆
I wonder if Bill Murray would experience a PTSD flashback watching this.
Oh, that's the actress for Artemis
oh!  I _was_ going to say, did you just trick me into watching an ad?!?  (I thought it was a short film, which it was, kindof, I watch them, so get 'recommended' them) - oh Ryan Reynolds, you darling man - _ALL_ your content here *is* an ad - straight up, no trickery involved (& yet I WILLINGLY watch..) .    & for once, I DO know what Lays taste like - (lived briefly in Belleville, Ontario, with my Canadian partner, then we moved (or in my case, returned) to Aotearoa/New Zealand - where we take our chips (or 'crisps') seriously (like way seriously - someone(not me) ranked all 123 chip flavours from best to worst, a few of my favourites...  Bluebird original (_only_ with classic kiwi dip..)  Bluebird Salt & Vinegar Bluebird Chicken Kettle Wood Fired BBQ Kettle Honey Soy Chicken Delisio Sweet Chilli Relish Delisio Greek Tzatziki Delisio Caramelised Onion and Balsamic Vinegar Delisio Mediterranean Feta and Herb Grain Waves Salsa Grain Waves Honey Mustard ETA Uppercuts Sweet Chilli Relish TA Uppercuts Sea Salt & Balsamic Vinegar ETA Uppercuts Sour Cream & Chives  Kettle Vintage Cheddar & Red Onion
I thought he would escape the loop after his act of kindness of giving her a bag with the Groundhog Day nod to our Phil Connor's escaped.
Damn artimis lost a lot of late she looking good
Took 8 watches of the commercial for me to realize she is saying the drawer won't close, not the store.
Always thought being the cashier would be the punishment in hell, not being the customer.  What a twist...
Needlenose Ned! Remember, the first step is a doozy!
Ryan you and your Maximum Effort team are an absolute geniuses. I absolutely enjoy every commercial you make and watch them all multiple times
so the message of this commercial dont buy lays or you get stuck
Yeah, you got me. Can't wait for the veggie popables version... I'd watch that too.  😜👍
Can't wait for Deadpool 3😂
Omg, this was brilliantly done. Great actor choice too
love the deadpool meat sticks in the background lol
I could watch Stephen Tobolowsky advertise Lays for eternity, am I right or am I right or am I right?
It's Ned! ...Ryerson!
I sure as heckfire remember this dude from somewhere
If you only had Bill Murray is the background or a cameo somewhere at the end but I feel he doesn't want to do this again.
Doesn't feel so good, does it, Ned?
Watch out for that first bag of lay's, it's a doooooozy.
Mikaeli, you sucessfully hit metal 17 times... day 65
Just imagine, it could have been resolved by going through the self check out >_>
Ned Ryerson!
OMEGA Mart, you have no idea what's in store for you!...
I would say marginal effort from maximum effort. Plus lays and the like are poison.
Isle 5 was on the right half of the store so where was that janitor taking the mop bucket when he was going left? 😮 Also props to those actors. I would be losing my mind with each take.
I was eating a burger while watching this and I blasted a mouthful everywhere at the end.
NED! RYERSON!!!
I want Lays for some reason now?
Jack barker
I cant see one of these bags without thinking thats a weird looking Walkers bag
Bing!
I have a feeling I just watched a four minute commercial 🤔
Ned?!
I'm weirding out !!!
I'm still on the waitlist for the released of Deadpool 3 trailer. 😂
No wonder Ryan's good at making ads, he's turned his entire media existence into a brand. Pity all the movies he's in are mediocre, forgettable guff.
All this needed was a scene at the end showing him leaving the store and Bill Murray calls out to him. "Stephen? Stephen Tobolowsky?! Stephen Tobolosky, I thought that was you!"
He never pays for them 😅
"Watch out for that first step! It's a dooosy"!
Ned?! Ned Ryerson?! Needle-Nose Ned? Ned the Head?! Am I right or am I right or am I right??
Well I’m off to buys some lays. Mission accomplished. 😊
Honestly, Ned Ryerson is the Groundhog Day Sequel we deserve...
Nothing like the crispylicious taste of lays and watching Who's The Boss!
“Guillermo!  Are you here to help me break this endless loop??”  “No, I’m just here to bring some tequila and Aviation Gin to go with the delicioso potato chips!  If you’re going to be stuck in the checkout lane forever, you might as well be drunk the whole time!  Pass me the Limon bag, por favor!”
I love ned charecter
Wasn’t he the paint picker in that 70s show? lol
It’s giving REAL WandaVision and Loki vibes 😂😂 I wonder if this is a Deadpool hint or smthg..
Why does he keep going back to that lady?
It’s REALLY giving WandaVision vibes 😂😂
OMG it is Stu Biggs from Californication.😂😂
Fuck, this fucking guy's commercials sure do keep me coming back.
You really can't have just one, can you?
Who needs a Superbowl ad when you can just have Ryan Reynolds post your video... I wonder which one is cheaper?
Lays papas fritas  Can’t make just one eat every  One groundhogs tail  #haiku #papasfritas #groundhogsday
Only Ryan can get me to watch a 4 minute commercial and not be furious
Thanks??........
🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Actual question how many flavours are there? If someone can name all of them cool. Also If there are region specific chips is the commercial going to change or still at the same store?
Your turn for a "?!"
I freaking love this commercial!!!
I wanna see the rest of this movie asap
Man, I just got tricked into watching a 4 minute 11 second commercial ... and I'm not even upset about it.
Excuse me, but does your store carry toasters?
Is that Artemis?
well that is an absolutely incredible commercial bit
Ryan do you own Lays now?
Watch that first step! It's a DOOZY!
Is that Professor Peter Sheffield?
I'm now waiting for Ryan to drop the Captain Planet Reboot trailer and Veronica Mars season 5 Written by and starring Ryan Reynolds.
Ned? Ned Ryerson!
Are they going to go bang in a dumpster now?
Ned need's to step up his game or he's never going to get ... Lay'd.
THESE BETTER ALL AIR DURING THE SUPERBOWL
Who holds a bag of chips like that?
Bing!
That uncertain laugh after the third time got me and I was laughing my butt off!
I'm only now realizing that I willingly just sat through 4+ minutes of commercials.
It's even funnier when you put the captions on. [STILL STRAINED LAUGHTER] [NO LAUGHTER] 🤣🤣
Straight up "This magic moment" Molson commercial action here... 😂
Babe wake up, new Mr. Beast challenge just dropped.
See if these streaming apps want us to pay for subscriptions but next to have ad revenue just have Ryan’s people do it and we might not cancel
You think after the second bag he'd learn to stop buying lays or go to another till
I sure as heck fire remember him!
This is a brilliant idea for a sequel
Clever 👀
TOBOLOWSKI!@?
Artemis ❤
I suddenly have a yearning for Lays….
Hilarious and who doesn't love Ground Hog Day.
It's NED! NED RIERSON!
Watch out for that first chip, it's a dooooozy!
*mmm I want to buy a lays chip *
Ned… Rierson!
For a moment there I thought that video had restarted and then I remembered "Groundhog Lay's"
Absolutely brilliant and hilarious
All that and they didn't get to my fave, Salt and Vinegar.  btw, just watched the movie Palm Springs for my first time a couple of days ago. If you liked this, you'll like that.
This was the longest 4 minutes of my life.
Ryan, your commercials are on a whole other level. They just keep me coming back. I would even say that again, just for you boss. Just for you ;)
Lays has LORE!?
Very good ad ... but Dill Pickle flavour?!?!?!!?!?!??!!?!?
Comedy is hard.  Wow did you think to run it by some people who were funny to see why this doesn't work.
Copywriting at its finest❤️
All I know is that cashier looks like she has a bleached asshole.
Good homage if it's for Groundhog Day. Bad homage if it's for Memento.
I love how the little background jingle keeps playing slower/faster/weirder with every ad.
"Nobody can eat just one!"
Mikaeli references incoming
Is that Artemis?
How many chips does it take to die by lays?
Makes me wonder how long I could live in the lays loop... Probably forever
Ned!  RYERSON!
Ryan I luv u man I rly rly do…..❤️
These are some of the best ads ever.
Holy Shit Ryan Reynolds is amazing at these!
Aviato
This cheered me up ❤
Imagine how great this could've been if they had come up with something funny. What a waste of a good idea.
man, these Ryan Reynolds supported, crowd entertaining Lays commercials just keep me coming back...
Frikin outstanding 👏 😂 great throwback too
Madam web? 😂
This is fantastic!
I'm literally buying Lay's next time I'm out.  You won this round Ryan.  I've already been with Mint for 2.5 years.  Now you have my Lay's money you sexy beast.
From piedpiper to lays.
This is brilliant. I have ad-blocking software on everything. I pay extra to NOT see ads if it's an option. But I just happily watched 10 commercials in a row. That's how it should be done. Well played, Ryan and Lays.
Is that… ARTEMIS?!?!
I love how the music slowly gets distorted as time loops.
Damn I want to know how it ends!!
Imagine watching this on the Maximum Effort Channel then this Channel, making the Groundhog Day joke even better.
Pure.. genius! including the one and only Phil Connors to raise this to the status of perfection.
Missed an opportunity to drop BING!
I saw this same video yesterday....huh...
BING!!!!!!!!
Artemis, always keeping it sunny
I remember when collegehumor made this joke. And god we need more nightmare commercials like this
It's Jack Barker!
Artemis!!!!
Jimmy Kimmel uploaded the same thing what is up with this shit?
If Bill Murray turned down this commercial, it was a huge mistake. And I'll say it again.
I know how you break the loop go to a different cashier.
Needle nose Ned, bing!
Walkers>Lays
I was waiting for Bill Murray to show up at the very end (after the end of part 8) to say "that's how it feels", before snatching the chip bag and walking off screen.
reminds me of that film
Why aren't big companies paying millions for these commercials!!!! Such fools! I WOULD BUY more CHIPS!!
Idk why but I was expecting a Gavin Belson cameo
"Hi. My name is Werner Brandes, my voice is my passport verify me."
I know what I'll be watching tomorrow. That first step is a real doozy.
Damn looks like life hasn't been kind to him after his silicon valley days
You ain’t gotta enough stuff you need a YouTube channel too? Goddam lol
Ned?!? Ned Ryerson?!? Needle-Nose Ned? Ned the Head?
If he just fixed the drawer for her, he'd be allowed to escape the loop. Also, Stephen is one of the nicest guys ever. Bing!
SCREW LAYS, WALKERS FOREVER!!!!!!!
2024 goal: be in one of Mr. Reynolds’ commercials
Ned, just get the Dill Pickle every time. Can't go wrong.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen that actor laugh!
This gotta be movie trailer
Lmaoo
I'm trying to change the stars.  What I mean is, get the IAU to, OFFICIALLY, make a new constellation.  My idea for changing the stars includes Orion and Pleiades (Subaru).  I figure it's time to put something up there that's relevant to us, don't you think?  Take Orion's belt and Betelgeuse becomes the head with a baseball hat.  The 3 stars of Orion's belt make up the 3 fat belt loops on a baseball uniform.  Below the belt are two legs bending at the knee.  Saiph is the back foot and Rigel is the front foot.  The feet aligning perfectly under the bent knees.  The spear pointing at "Subaru" is the bat being swung and "Pleiades" is the baseball flying away after being hit.  Bellatrix is the hand that let go of the bat.  Put it all together and you get, "THE ALL-STAR."  In my case, I see a left-handed batter and I imagine a "7" on the jersey. Which makes him, "Mickey." (As it should be ;-) But you can put any number you want, making, "THE ALL-STAR," any player you want. It'd  be wrong of me to not, at least, try.  This is me, trying. Pass it on, please and thank you. Don't worry, where I come from, crazy is a compliment. ;-P
Poor Ned
I just watched four minutes of commercials.  Hell, I've subscribed to a YT channel that posts literally nothing but commercials.
for a second i thought it was marcy behind the counter xd
Yes, yes, we are in hell...  Ryan Reynolds is the only person I'd willingly watch that hell for... lol 😂😊❤
No magic masala...😢
Parte 2 ahora ya pero ya Part 2 naw
Too bad Lay's chips are overpriced. They should spend less money on commercials and lower prices for consumers.
*I am sure there is some sort of nightmare going on here. Its inside that empty bag of air they keep selling us.*
No normal person walks around holding a bag of crisps like that. Freak
MR. REYNOLDS SIR, PLEASE KEEP DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING.  LAUGHTER IS KILLING THE STUPIDITY OUT THERE AND I LOVE THIS.
Do beef jerky next!
"mY voICe iS My pASsport, VeriFy mE"😄
Artemis! 💜
This definitely requires a rewatch of Groundhog Day. Ned, I miss you! Rrrrrwow!
Unbelievable!  Normally, I would turn it off screaming after 30 sec😁Ryan made me watch it till the end, wondering what was going to happen next😂
is that Artemis?
Just wait until he finds out Lays and Walkers are the same thing and has to do this all again, with different names, new flavours....and even Prawn Cocktail!
While I love this, I just see Ryan stealing Artemis and adding her to his collection with Rob McElhenney in order to further hurt Glenn Howerton.
Ryan gave Ned from Groundhog Day his own commercial where he gets Grounhog Day'd lol.
alright this is dystopian... wheres bill murray
We may never have a full official GD sequel, but we keep having these small GD sequels in a form of commercials. I consider all of these canon. :D Hahaha...  Keep 'em coming everyone involved with the original GD film!
After this commercial, I don't want to eat these chips anymore
кал
So I know this is funny and I luv Goundhog Day, but now I'm afraid to pick up a Lay's packet LMAO!
BING!!
So curious how many of us who watched this today, will buy chips on the way home..
my name is artemis and i have a bleached asshole
Okay, I hate commercials, but these were actually pretty good.
"Every day another lay." I'll take 20% from that if it goes to advertising.
Commercialception at its finest
This is why I use the self checkout
Ned!
YouTube Ad - SKIP Ryan Reynolds Ad - thiiis is gonna be gooood 😎😂
Wtf??? How can Ryan Reynolds get me to watch a freaking commercial for potato chips!!! He's so evil! As payback, I think we should force Ryan to do a reboot of Two Girls, a Guy and a Pizza Place.
LOKI VIBES
Like 2 of those flavors exist in my country, and one of them is the original.
Genius
Until I watched this I had no idea how many flavors Lays has, nor would I have wanted to try them. That’s all changed! Brilliant use of comedy to sell a product.
Damn everything from the acting to the direction, to the script, to the sound design, everything in this ad is masterful
Oh my god 😂😂😂
Oh brilliant, I had to keep watching just for the punchline - or someone giving Ned another right hook to the jaw, LOL.
I love that it was the pickle flavor that broke him.
No *MESSAGE*  No agenda just a funny commercial for something I really ought not eat.  Well done, Mr. Reynolds.
I love this. It reminds me of those surreal infomercial commercials that Cartoon Network would put on occasionally like uninterrupted footage of a bear
Was waiting for bill Murray to show up.
😂
And the Lays in the foreign market are awesome...
This is a sneak peak into Deadpool3 lol jajaja
You just made me watch a four minute commercial. I don't watch commercials. This was amazing.
BING AGAIN!
Oooooo...veggie poppables?!
Artemis!!
This made me laugh AND uncomfortable at the same time.
Man didn't pay for his Dill Pickle Chips.
I love how the background music takes a turn. Subtle - but i heard what you did there. 👨‍🍳💋
😅🤣😂
Best commercial ever !!!!! Well Ryan, and your team. Well done!!!😎
Does this require a sponsored content disclosure?
Is it weird how much I look forward to seeing Ryan’s commercials when they come out? 😂❤
Artemis sure knows a lot about getting Lay'd
loki behind all of it
I haven't seend Stephen Tobolowsky in anything for a while, why is that
Kept waiting for Ryan Reynolds to pop out, but Stephen Tobolowsky is goated
groundhog day february 2nd. is based on a german superstition. in germany though its not a groundhog that forcasts a early spring or longer winter, its a badger.
THIS looks like a case for Mulder and Scully - X-Files... The Spooky series Ryan Reynolds appeared in S3 E13 - 'Syzygy'.. Eh Ryan? 😉😋🤣🤣🤣 😎🇬🇧
Only Ryan could make us watch commercials for 4 minutes and 11 seconds.  Willingly.  And thankful for it.
Wait…they make Veggie Popables? ‘Scuse me while I run over to Publix.
Excuse mr Reynolds,  where's the ketchup flavour?  Come on ryan you're better than that.
i swear i'm not on drugs...
"Phil?!"
BING!
So this is what happened to the guy that garfield electricuted
God damn. Minor details, changing the key of the music, slightly different coverage. Very very nice 👌🏻
That's the Dude from the Unifi Videos :))))
This is another Sammy Jankis case?
Artemis at her day job when she's not banging Frank in the dumpster behind Burger King.
The best!
I saw this is my notifications, didnt even watch the video, called my mom and asked her to buy me Lays😂
😂😂
Holy shit, Artemis is looking noice.
🧡
Still waiting on that dollar
Action Jack Barker!? I thought that was youuuuuuuuu.
I love lays and I love this guy!
I actually like ths dill pickles flavor!
Ryan is the only person that makes me want to watch Ads... Well they are great tax deductions for the companies :)
Artemis!!!
Man i haven’t seen Ned ryerson in years, I could never forget that guy
Incredibly satisfying.
Now this is a good commerical😂
My goodness you all are so funny and clever. I love yall.
That was funny! I never watch commercials  lol! Are we in hell? That was so great!!! 😂😂
I had 0 anticipation about this and i was wrong. It's hularious
I've got a Groundhog Day episode airing tomorrow and I love that this movie keeps getting homage's done for it! Anyone else notice that the store music's tempo changes day after day? Also, should we not question why this man goes through a bag of Lay's a day? It's like getting a bag that large of Lay's every day is a normal thing. I know he could be going, "Well. I thought I had a bag at home but now it's not there, I guess it's time to get another one" because the day is resetting.....but that doesn't make sense either.....it's almost like he's in a commercial of some sort.... 🤔
Here in the UK we call them Walkers :D
best grounghog day sequel ever... we didn't know we needed it buy Ryan gave it to us....
Dude...it took me way too long to get the concept...c'mon pattern recognition ya trippin' this mornin' 😂😂
Ryan somehow made the greatest Chips on earth Horrifyingly terrifying! Hilarious 😂😂😂! Best one yet! Love a good Lays by the daily lunch schedule.
Ned... Ned Ryerson?
It's the devil!!!  The theory goes that Ned Ryerson is actually the embodiment of the Devil, and that he deliberately traps Phil in the time loop as a form of punishment.  But seriously, give it up for Stephen Tobolowsky everyone!!!!
anyone else notice the music getting more anxiety inducing every time?
Wait a minute - Needlenose Ned? Ned the Head? Don't you tell me you don't remember me, 'cause I sure as heckfire remember you!
Is there a Remake of Groundhog Day coming out or a TV Adaptation of the movie or what is this?
Litterally like free guy
Ryan made me watch all of them, and id watch all of them again,,,
Artemis! There's a fun fact about her that you may not know....
Watch out for that first Lay, it's a doozy.
I smell burnt toast
Brilliant!
very good yes :)
Is that Needle Nosed Ned?  Ned the Head!
lmao! i did not see that coming!
Can these be remade as Walkers for the euro market??
NED!
Needle nose Ned
Still waiting for the blue LAYS
Needlenose Ned?!?
didn't expect this. nice. amazing.
Groundhog Day is my favourite movie
The best commercials!! Beautiful movie, a great actor, just brilliant 😍😍
Ned? Ned Ryerson!!!!
Wait…was this a commercial FOR or AGAINST Lays 🤣
Ned? Ned Ryerson!!!!
I can’t believe that Reynolds guy made me watch this and even worse, I laughed!
Ned the head?? BING!
I did it Ryan. Danced like a monkey...10 times. Hope you're proud of your genius. ❤
There are over 200 varieties of Lay's chips.
Man got stuck in Matrix
Super Bowl ad, I take it?
Pacing for this was too slow.
I don't think I've ever voluntarily watched this many ads.
Love the barbecue Lay's.
Action Jack Barker
Ned? Ned Ryerson!?!?
the fact that he played Ned Ryerson in the original movie makes it all the better for me XD
Who noticed that the description is wrong? "What if we make ads more fun with the other 364 days of the year?" Should be 365 since this year has 366 being a leap year 😂
Stephen Tobolowsky is a national treasure. Amiriteoramiriteoramirite? #remembersammyjankis
Lays: the flavour of Conjoined Triangles of Success.
wait wheres ryan?
Please be in the super bowl.
https://sanctions.nazk.gov.ua/en/boycott/  this ain't it.
I accept this as canon
And yet, I still don't want them...
This is what makes me soo exited for  Ryan's next performance in any movie....
I’d bet Stephen Tobolowsky understood why Bill Murray hated being on Groundhog Day now.
I was thinking because HE was in Groundhog day with Bill Murrary (as the insurance salesman who says after Bill steps in that puddle "Oh be careful")that that was the recurring theme there. Then Ryan works in his brand of humor towards the end and commercial genious magic is born.
Ned? Ryserson? Needlenose Ned, Ned The Head? I sure as heck if I remember you!
Why is Ryan Reynolds suddenly posting a bunch of random commercials? 😭 They’re funny, but what is going on here…?
Ned Ryerson! Needle-nose Ned, Ned the Head, Used-to-Date-Your-Sister-until-You-Told-Him-to-Stop! I was waiting for someone to get punched in the face. 😂
So I don’t have normal tv with commercials anymore but I could imagine this series of commercials randomly playing in between breaks of a show and people getting more invested in this guy getting out of the store than w.e they were watching.
Incredible.  Simply incredible.
Now I want some crisps. Any flavour, all the flavours.
i love how you know Lays was on set telling them exactly how he needs to hold the product lol
I've never seen a pack of  chips that full
Ned ... Ned Ryerson??   Is that you???   🤣   This is great :D
Artemis!
Those lays can get you laid😂😂
Ned?  Ned Ryerson?
Ned? Ned Ryerson?
Be still my heart, if it isn't Ned Ryerson! Needle-nose Ned, Ned the Head!
The only Channel on YouTube I will willingly sit and watch a commercial for 😄😄😄  Always a Fan Mr Reynolds and hug your furbabies all 💙🐱💙
lol
That last one was funny. Dude was tricked into the cycle all over again.
"NED!" is maybe my favorite movie moment ever. Way to maximize a set and talent! It's the scrappiness of it all that may be the most brilliant thing!
Ned!!!   It keeps you comin back!
How appropriate that he keeps going to checkout number 2 because of the date of GHD; 02/02 Stephen Tobolowsky is a legend, it would have also been amazing if Chris Elliot was in some of these too.
The background music shifts really put the icing on the cake.  Genius.
Genius.
This feels like something from Omega Mart
Beautiful
Worst part of capitalism. Ryan thumbs down on this part of ur life.
I fricken hate you right now. 😂
… God damn, I just watched 4 minutes of adverts that get more depressing.
legend says he still havent gotten half way through the list of delicious flavors Lays has
🤣😂😅👍
and i alll say it again
The only man I know who can get me to WILLINGLY watch a 4 minute ad about chips.
It took me a few seconds to recognize Stephen, I'm glad Ryan manages to not only find these old actors who aren't as popular as they once were and get them more mainstream recognition.
😂😂
Imagine if RYAN himself played the cashier!!!
Rod Sterling must've kept this episode of The Twilight Zone tucked away.
So, THE DEVIL becomes his own Ned…I LOVE IT; good job, Ryan and Team.
Pobre señor esta atrapado en un bucle temporal sera por culpa de Deadpool?
I was feeling the guy's anxiety by the time he got to the Dill Pickle flavour.
What in the Loki, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Edge of Tomorrow, Doctor Strange, About Time is this🙃
— I did not know there were so many weird flavors .
Gotta watch out for that first bag, it’s a doozie!
what if somebody just casually watches de 8th one though 😭 like are they played in TV consecutively or randomly??
The only way Lays are good... In an ad like this; kinda.
Ned? Ned Ryerson?
But Groundhog Day is tomorrow! 😂
😂😂😂 Loved it and the end was hilarious 👍
Haha, well done. Groundhog Day is one of my favorite movies
*very confused laughter* 😭😭😭
Needle Nose Ned?!
This would make an excellent series of Super Bowl ads! You're just watching them thinking, oh, I've already seen this one. No wait, that's not what happened last time. Slowly going crazy with each one...
I seriously need to get Lays.
He got his revenge. Happy Groundhog Day everyone. Watch out for tat first step it’s a dozy.
OMG this would drive people insane
NED? NED RYERSON?!
Not Ned Ryerson!
Marketing genius. If only they would have had Sonny & Cher’s “I Got You Babe” playing in the background.
Yup, it's Super Bowl season.
innit
He needs to make this a full length movie!
OMG! Do you take revenge of me with them? 🤔 it doesn't ever hurt. 😁
Lays it still is weird for me too see that name over here we call them walkers
I kept waiting for Asia's Heat of the Moment to come on the overhead radio.
Does he sell an insurance policy to cover crushed chips?    ;-P
Was expecting him to mention Conjoined Triangles of Success somewhere
Oh know what happens when that happens to other fav snacks for dare i say it film franchises like when deadpool drops his little tush into the mcu  sorry about that part im straight i just thought that might be funny to one person
This is canon to both Silicon Valley and Always Sunny now
LOL hey that's insurance agent Ned!!😂
I got a headache after this shit video
That was an original lays movie foundation! Do it Ryan, Do it 😂
Awesome man. Loved it 😂😂😂😂
Was hoping they would show Ketchup flavoured. I had some last night. 😢
This Ryan Reynolds guy is going places.
At this point every brand should just hire Ryan to make their commercials
Where can I meet cashiers like this?
Make this a Superbowl commercial next weekend.
Only Ryan could make me watch 4 minute ad.
those are not chips , thats flavored air inside the pack
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They are going to fall in love and then lay's will run out of flavors.
They're Walkers. What the fuck is a lay.
Remember Sammy Jankis!! 😜😜
Lay offs at Disney Marvel
At my local shop here they only have 2 flavours of Lay's.  BBQ and Salt.  Please send Dill Pickle to Sweden!
Is there going to be a part 2?
These Lay's commercials do keep me coming back
Deadpool
10/10
It's so bad. I love it!
I haven't been Lay's in a while.
and disney wanna control ryan's style???
"Neddddd?? Ned Ryersonnnn???"
After this, i need to LAY down
Turns out that isn't a groundhog Day loop,  aisle 5 is just really messy, and the woman likes to repeat herself
Liminal advertising.  The world is so crazy now that this feels comfortable🤗
“Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?”
I'm in the UK and we don't have Lays....now I want some 😂😂
HUH
This isn't going to have me eat more Lays (I'm more of a sweets kind of person) but A plus and some friggin gold stars for marketing genius.
How to watch 10 ads without even knowing...
Absolutely great!
When you get the the end and laugh so hard. Love it
☆Its Always Sunny in Gobbler's Knob☆
Annual 'requirement' to watch Groundhog Day... Now i'll have to do it with Lay's
Artemis!!!!❤❤❤ "What if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today!"
The UK need to take notes our ads are so boring
Notice it's register 2. Groundhog day.
Ned!? Ned Ryerson!?!?
Ryan is by now an advertising savant
ARTEMIS!!!
this is giving me Loki / TVA vibes... maybe it was supposed to be like that..
This can only mean that Phil Connors discovered how to trap someone in a time loop and decided to try it with Ned Ryerson, the insurance guy
are we in hell LOL thanks for making me watch this  made my start of the morning
Artemis, I love her!
I am going to watch this a lot. Everyday, at the same time, forever..............
Ryan Reynolds is the only man to get me to rewatch the same ad over and over again. Ryan Reynolds is the only man to get me to rewatch the same ad over and over again. Ryan Reynolds is the only man to get me to rewatch the same ad over and over again. Wait a second... oh yeah Ryan Reynolds is the only man to get me to rewatch the same ad over and over again.
No Bill Murray cameo? Missed opportunity...
Ned Ryerson...
What a great homage to a great movie.  And I love most all the flavors of Lay's.
HAPPY CHADMAN IS BACK!!!
Feels like I have seen this commercial before...
People may not know this, but Ryan’s middle name is Midas.
Love Artemis
BING!
What is this black mirror
ohhhh f u!!! lol
I cant believe ryan reynolds is the only wholesome, creative guy left in hollywierd.
Watch out for that first step, it's a doozy!
Bing!
Wait isn’t that Artemis from it’s always sunny?
He has the best commercials i swear.
Best commercial ever and I'll say it again.
RRey another good one. Looks like part 2 is on repeat. I’m here for all the flavor.
Artemis
I’ll watch anything with MY Ryan’s name attached to it! This is great but only makes sense if you’ve seen the film and know the actor. Makes a nice change for him to be on the receiving end of an annoying repeated conversation!! Genius. Hoping Phil is going to say winter is over as I need to know in the UK.
every time I see Stephen Tobolowsky I think of the movie Dr. Jekyll  and Ms. Hyde from 1995.
I wonder if Jeffrey Dahmer ever thought about human flavoured Lays? 🤔
Bing! 😂😂😂
watch out for that first bag, it's a doozie
He just needs the conjoined triangles of success
Ryan D GOAT
Ned, Ned Ryerson
Artemis! welcome to the gang Ryan.
Ned Ryerson, is that you!
They need to get laid.  Oh, wait.  They did?
lmaoooo
😂😂😂😂. I caught on at Sourceam and onion🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm glad it was not Ryan as Ken 🥲
Ya saca el Trailer de Deadpool 3
Is He the Insurance guy from Groundhog day? His goofy laugh brings back the memory.
The existential dread is the true seasoning that makes it so tasty.
A perfect example of why Disney needs to STFU and let him make Deadpool 3 his way.
Just a corporate ad. Nothing noteworthy
and here we are again. Reynolds scratching inside our little heads, with absurd ideas.
Ryan Reynolds is such a marketing GENIUS!
This is how you give homage to a great movie without ripping it off.  I absolutely love this.
I’m currently on the pooper at work watching this with absolutely ZERO sound and I’m still liking it
Ryan just made me watch a dude having Groundhog day in a supermarket with different lays😭
the simps are here as usual raving about how Ryan made them watch a commercial and how they loved it. sigh!
I like this guy in silicon valley
Oh my god! 🤣🤣🤣
why this video keep repeating, i didn't click repeat button.
Getting Stephen Tobolowsky to do this was a stroke of genius, and I actually watched all eight of these. Mission accomplished
OMG, Artemis and MST3K together 😂😂😂😂
If this was a actual add I’m not skipping this one! Q😁
slogan should of been lays for days
Phil? PHIL!!!!
IS THAT ARTEMIS??
❤❤
Thank you Tommy Wiseau for another banger of an Ad. Just keeep me coming back!!!
*Gramps ain't havin it*
Wait, I don't get this one...
I want lays now😂
The groundhog Air packet!!!🎉🎉🎉
It's like watching the clock click over to 6:00...  😁  (It would have been better if Bill Murray showed up and hugged him again, lol...)
Epic  💯
Thought it was a franchise of Jack Barker. Those little triangles of success just keep him coming back...
Lime flies when you're having fun. Those puns are incredible! If this is hell then sign me up, we want to lays so we can _lays_ down and chill xD
When are you going to be in a cowboy film ryan? I think it’s about time no?
i'll take 20 more, make that 40 !
Brilliant. Love the real dark tone.
Thanks for the content daddy.
Ryan's ads just keep me coming back.
Ah thats why superbowl is coming
Watch out for that first step…it’s a DOOZY!
Blimey, Ned's hardly changed in 3 decades...he definitely must be stuck in some kind of time loop.
it annoys me that this was posted thru Ryan Reynolds channel. Kinda funny, but im still pissed
ryan or whatever gnome he has chained up to come up with these ads, is pure gold.
This is fucking great dude you make the best stuff have a greatday hope your next movie is a banger and cant wait for dp3 and yes I am one of those fake motherfuckers that watched both movies after they came out so I do say they aways had me rolling in laughter thanks man keep the greatness up.
You know a movie's got staying power when it's 30 years old and the face of one of the actors in the thumbnail makes you instantly know the gist of the video. Ok, the time of year probably helped as well. And.. the word Groundhog. Stop ruining the moment!
Deadpool 3 first trailer announcement when?
I’m so early wtf?!
wandavision and trueman show creepy vibes
HAHAHA..."Are we in hell?"
First it was Bill Murray, now it’s the insurance guy
We in Canada salute you 🫡🇨🇦 you are a breath of fresh air 😊
Ah yes, the average commercial that I'm totally not theorizing on
Classic 😂
Ned Ryerson? Bing!
Any one else expecting something to do with deadpool 3 Lmao
clever commercial nice😂
"Remember Sammy Jankis.."
Genius
👍🏻💗
Finally something they sell in India....We skip ads....and Ryan Reynolds make us watch them😂
The best commercial I've ever seen in my life 😂
Lays: Ryan, we’d like you to make us a commercial.  Ryan: What if Lays reminded people they were in an unending hell of starch and repetition?
I've said it before and I'll say it again: Ryan Reynold's a marketing Genius, Can't wait for DP 3!
Lol
Yo
Laysing down in purgatory
NPCs be like 😂
If only they could have got Bill Murray to cameo and have Stephen punch HIM this time
Yo ryan reynolds
Beautiful homage to a classic movie in a Lays commercial. Brilliant
Ned Ryerson
This just this is why Sir Ryan "Deadpool" Reynolds is a gift to humanity that we don't deserve but are so thankful for
the only guy who can make me watch an entire commercial
I said I'll watch ads over and over if they come from you.. so here I am
Ok...awkward.
Amazing
Damn, now I’ll hungry.
Deadpool 3 might deal with doing things over and over.  (Supersecrethiddenegg)
There are infinite number of flavour of Lay's.
I'm just waiting for deadpool to show up in one of these ads.
Ryan not only made me watch a commercial, he made me watch 10. ... And I'd watch 10 more for you, boss.
I love a disturbing video to start my day. Thank you Rey! You seem to know what your audience really needs and wants! ❤
Meta-ception
He’d get out if he paid for a single bag instead of just walking off.
#AD
Amazing
Just fix the damn register damn it!
Ryan Reynolds is making everything brilliant
740th view and 37th comment!
She actually said it again.
Amazing
awkwaaard
1:54 : No pun or cute name for those Lay's? For shame!
