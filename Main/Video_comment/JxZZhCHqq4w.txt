Did anyone see the dog running around
Even with a swerve ball, he couldn't curve like Roberto Carlos
10:16 bro is better than any Pakistani fielder and he doesn’t even play cricket 💀
GOD LOVES YALL
3:39 anyone else notice the writing on the nearest post
Well done to both of you 😊
I would like to see: a paper airplane, a cricket ball wrapped in lots of bubble wrap, a shuttlecock, square ball, moon ball, medicine ball, rubber bowling pin, lawn dart, screwed up ball of paper, sponge ball, elastic band ball, ball filled with foam
I play in all positions but my best is goalie. He is extremely good in goals
He could also stop a bullet if u try it on him🤗
What team does he play for
How are you Cameraman :ooooo
4:05
For the pro goalkeeper a tip at the shot at 1:10 he should had dived, staring is a bad habit that every gk has but should stop, always try!
This was incredible! Great idea aswell!
Basketball players watching this video😢
does he play for a team
this keeper has incradible light falling he has no pain in those falls i think
#Kieran Brown is he on  FIFA? if he is whats his rating
If you can't catch the ball your as, I don't use gloves. If I use gloves I can't catch
Can I have  goalkeeper  gloves please
Bro you can see someone’s dog running in the background 8:00
This challenge reminds me of the 80s version of Captain Tsubasa, when Tsubasa met Genzo for the first time.
dope, great content
I’m Aussie I meant
He forgot something an afl/Australian football league ball I’m u know
The volley ball look like knuckel ball
Next up a real life bullet
Hi
hey kieran just want to say i love ur vids keep it up
Who else wanted the frisbee to hit the frisbee and/or the post?
Medicine ball?
The next emi martinez
0:02 man really said "goakeeper"
Amazing keeper
1:15 I’m only human after all
We always respect what the video is about but ever realize how good Kieran is like he has the potential to play for an every year champions league qualifying team
Find the mistake in the intro (SPOILERS)          Goakeeper really?
Anyone have a link for the final ball they used?
12:14 very smooth comment
imagine giving the swurve ball to Roberto Carlos
Book
Hello where can I buy the shooter ball the ball that moved a lot?
What a saves
Good  job  Kieran . If you keep on practicing you will be  better
10:41
Goakeepeer?
Офигенная реакция!!!!
I pro goal keeper too but don't you hate it when a teen called it a goalie.? It sounds babyish
U should try the same challenge with two goalkeepers
as a goalkeeper im not going to lie he's pertty good
Praat Nederlands met me
I'm a Rugby player it is not fun when it's on the ground because it just goes up down up
Now that’s a great goalie!
So good at saving goals
Which normal football brand did he use at the start
Too bad he didnt use the bowling ball. Lol
Can he stop the Belt on mother's hand?
3:59 what a save bro
As a goalkeeper this guy is incredible
epicc
Ok now try with cricket ball 🙂☠️
This is one of my favorite videos by kieran brown
Videos like this just want me to become a better keeper
This guy is a pro? He doesn't even play on a team. Got rejected from Bournmouth
Of course not that's why Messi and Cristiano has scored so many goals. Goalkeepers are NPCs on the field
It's on the goal keeper ☺️
I thought he said huge dick rims for a second, but it was huge difference lol
Chefootball
Ending_
the wakabayashi challenge?
He should be in *THE WORLD CUP*
its a soccer ball not a  football
I remember they used to hit tennis balls at us when I was a kid 😂 at the 18 though
Where do you get the Shoot ball? It looks like a ton of fun
What about cricket ball
I love how frustrated Europeans get when Americans say “soccer”
Me: WHERES THE BOWLING BALL
Imagine getting hit in the face by the basketball!!!
Where is the American football?
0:03 goakeeper lol 😂
They shouldve tried an American football
Ayy
In the next episode let's see if he can stop a bullet
What a Goakeeper!
I wish to be like this goal keeper 🤩🙏
11:06 is CRAZY 😂😭
They should use an American football!
wow, I can't believe every shot is a curve.
what team dose every one suport i suport man united
Can he stop 50 cal tho? I dont think so 💀
Need to tee off a golf ball ⛳ 😊
my friend is 8 and hes a better goalkeeper than u lol
8:17 no thats a football
More like wannabe pro goalkeeper. Still got A LOT to learn.
10:12 what is this song called
I just hate when I see someone HITTING A VOLLEYBALL WITH THEIR FOOT VOLLEYBALLS ARE NOT FOR FEET
Time stamps
7:18 can someone tell me the music's name?
btw dont kick the volleyball too many times, its going to get into an egg shape
Ok now the bowling ball
Omg you are my sister in my life so you are not going to be my friend
What an amazing goalie
Goalkeeper def plays cricket
I think you need improve your shot power
anything i can think of? Where is the cannon ball. :DDDD
i call this "the genzo wakabayashi challenge"
5:01  frisbee
they act like a volleyball is bad i use it for soccer
why did u kick the volley ball it will slowly break do a hammer serve instead or over head
I saw this in a captain tsubasa episode
Uss se puch krr aao ?!?!?..... Cricket khelega ?     Please dont say 'chota ball se kon khelega'.......
goalkeeper training on tiktok be like
You spelled goalkeeper wrong 😂😂😂
4:50 gun
was expecting that every ball would get fired like it would in their respective sport. Disappointed 😐
gym teacher: don't kick the basketball kieran: 3:49
that swerve ball would be fun to practice with
I hope he can stop my parents from getting into my browsing history...

Miro

I am 16 years old now and like your video. I do observation of your videos at 0.5x and there has been improvement in my keeping.
I get shoot 5’s shot at me every day in school. It’s very very hard
The goalkeeper is class
10:13 😲😲🥶🥶
I love cricket
The br`ish Accent is too hard to understand and werid
I am also a goalkeeper and frisbee would be my nightmare
Fun fact is i have that same volleyball
I want to be better than him
I thought u were Gonna Kick The Frisbee 🦵😂😂🤣🤣
but the goalkeeper can catch the jabulani?
who is he??? Genzo Wakabayashi???
this makes me wanna be a gk
This reminds me of Oliver and Benji.
When I saw boxing gloves, i thought he's gonna kick those.
YouTube loves Kieran:)
This was one valuable Experiment in the interest of mankind.
M8
"I'm a half decent goalkeeper and now I'm baking cakes" LMAO. Then he saves a top bin with them on. too funny.
Loooooooser Golkapeeeeeeeeeeeeer
This is a pagal
1 in a billion the save
The ads are so perfectly placed
All balls ?  Polling ball : am i joking to you ?
5:44 / 6:01 / 6:09 / 6:14 / 7:54 / 9:42 / 10:14
What team does he play on? Or is he not an ACTUAL pro? If he’s not on a team he’s not a pro.
Allmost 2 mil go on
wow f8 jasper
Football = Like Soccer = reply
He isn't a Goalkeeper he is a Goatkeeper

Wows

😂😂😂
Wat is name of the song? 7:28

I practised occasionally with tennis balls for my highschool team goalkeeping :P
Where do I get the shoot footballs
Go back to the start it goakkeeper
5:44 that dive is soo clean tho 🥶🥶💯💯🥵🥵❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Can u stop a meteorite 😇
This video was so good that YouTube commented
From the camera in the Galway is face look very  red when they're for prison
It was really very impressive for a goalkeeper
I think it was very impressive
had some captain tsubasa flashbacks
So good that it made me sub first vid  Made me laugh man 🤣
3:50 - my PE teacher would kill you :)
Try it with darts that shunt be a problem
Next video idea: can a goal keeper stop bullets
You guys have a nice accent and love the vids keep it up
I think I was the first to notice the writing on the left post 3:38
I love when kieran hits top corner he sounds like a formula 1 driving by
can he catch a bullet yes or no kiren
0:01
You should do a Collab with miniminter
https://youtu.be/u0SiiMOk5cM
Next time try a bowling ball
8:00  The DOG 🐕 🤣🤣🤣
Poo poo 💩💩💩💩💩💩
I’m American and sometimes I think their speaking Arabic
Is a swerve ball supposed to be flat
Man when he kicked the volleyball instead of spiking it and the kicked the basketball……….I got worried about the frisbee
what a save
10:55 POV: you out sliders on FIFA 22
just they say save be like:SAAAIIIIIVEEE
1:20
1:12
He only let in 18 goals
I reckon he couldn’t stop a bullet
What's the swerve ball called
What is godly name
6:36
I think a GOAKEEPER can but not a goalkeeper
no Englesh
gwnw macha kam
chone bashed bash Gwlm ❤❤ me xoshm Awaet
Bro what is the music you use
I would b horrible with the curveball coz I rely on sheer power meaning if I hit it I’m hammering it full pelt and it’s going flying
No hockey puck or bullet?
He can't not stop the cars😂
Pok
KEEPER POV: *You Found Some Skillfull Person Of The Street*😂😂
Thoroughly entertaining video.
m,
Light tho?
Oh that’s going to be hard
The black screen at the front with the text, it said goakeeper and not goalkeeper, lol
Ideal didn't sub to you
I love your videos
the sport teacher from the school coming for you...
Says swerve ball has so much curve when he uses his outside part of his foot to shoot the ball
Does anyone know the name of the song that starts at 7:19
Your content is always so entertaining and this video was top tier. Keep up the good work man
I’m a goalkepper
Sui
The exercise ball was very big
Have Carlos shoot these then see if he stops anything 😂
Kieran can you make a video of Dec vs knuckleball twins?
I love football well done on this beautiful goal nice
🙀🙀🙀
I like the way he curves balls
How do u kick a basketball?
I love him when he score
As a tennis player, if you really whacked the ball or even hit a serve, there is now way a goalkeeper is saving that.
Yooo
If I was ever in this guys vids I would freak out so much I love u Kieran ❤️
Bro rhe yoga ball had me dying with that noise it makes lmao
Nice. A spelling mistake in the first 10 frames. That's rare. 😅
Bet they couldnt stop a bullet
Oh nobody undeestands the feeling of a gk after goal expext goalkeepers
As a basketball player my heart crushed when you shoot that basketball! Bro its expensive NBA Spalding ball! Just kidding, keep it up, Kieran!
As a goalkeeper and ultimate frisbee player, the part with the frisbees was hilarious. Part 2 where you bring in an audl player?
0:21 rhe orange and white balm j have at my home!
You're videos are prefect
THAT IS THE BEST GOALIE EVER!!!
why does itsay pitch one of the sides of the post
No one going talk about the dog that came in the back
I feel like with the tennis ball, the frisbee and maybe even the rugby ball, it would be fun to watch a pro player take shots. Tennis would probably be next to impossible to save while frisbee and rugby would be hard.
Love it the best video!
This GK should be playing actual football
So close to 2m less gooo
God
What was everyones favorite save and ball? That they used
He is the best keaper ever
Yo he can catch the Frisbee like untimely Frisbee
Try sending him a captain america shield
He’s very good at Saving lots of things
as a volleyball player i can tell that every volleyball player/nerd that watched this got mad when he kicked it and not use  hes hand's but i cant do non about that cus he more use to useing his feet
It’s so fun to watch
no because he can not stop a bullet
Amazing performance from both Love it Kieran
My favourite is swerve ball (AKA my brother irl)
Hola
How does he not get ITCHY!!??
ima goalie
The cameraman: Ooh                             Oooh                             Ooh                             Ooh                             Oooh
Great video the goalkeeper is very good !
i dont think a GOAkeeper can stop everything
The real talent here is being able it kick all these items. Great job both of you.
sad
d
I was a pro keeper and this guy is incredible
Can a goalkeeper stop a car?
I have the reaction ball myself
You don’t have the second most popular sport in the world on that list
Scam, There wasn't a BB gun
You should have added a football (not soccer)
I’m not hating or anything but I found funny At the start I thought it said goatkeeper but it said goakeeper
Made me laugh
The last ball is how i expect my nuckleball to be
I have one word for him : different grebby
This dude has hacked 'FOCUS'
I love the fact you added the song plate of rio
Even with the Frisby he was very good
No, no he cant.
THIS VIDEO SUCKS
Just asking is that Springfield park?
This was a genuinely nice video. Well done!
Roberto Carlos using the swerve would be lit
Who can’t save a frisbee
Damn,let's call Neuer!!
I live in Australia so I don't know if this is the same with American Footballs, or any other types of footballs, but Tryin to tell where an AFL football is going to go is near impossible since the almost always bounce in a random direction
This man needs to be the wolves keeper
Making the new goalkeeper for England so we don’t lose the new World Cup
can he stop a bullet tho?
When you megged him he was like the worst keeper in the world Allison Becker
COOL MAN
Are you Irland🤨🤨🤨🤨
My school dose not allow football balls at all so we use tennis balls
Cool 😐
-Can a pro Goal Keeper stop a angry bull towards him? -Can a pro Goal Keeper stop a car going 60 mph towards him? -Can a pro Goal Keeper stop a bullet flying towards him? -Can a pro Goal Keeper stop a Karen?
Absolute legend
You spelt goalkeeper wrong in the intro
Why am I watching this I don’t even like soccer
Whats is his fifa card 😁😁🤣
Is someone streaming there garden or someone riding a motorcycle in the field 🤣
I just can’t help but notice that your clothes are so good looking.😮‍💨
Turn to Jesus Christ everyone amen 🙏
Turn to Jesus Christ everyone amen 🙏
Turn to Jesus Christ everyone amen 🙏
Turn to Jesus Christ everyone amen 🙏
You forgot cricket ball
You should have 200000m subs
Ok but he literally looks like Robert Patterson
Nick
At 1:23 that looked like that hurt his head

0:02 misspelt goalkeeper
Goakeeper

Can a pro goal keeper stop a .50 BMG?
I love the sound when you kick the exercise ball.

Watching this video made me a better goal keeper my  self
WHAT A SAVE AT 10:12

The goalkeeper weakness is on his left side
you know bro? kicking volleyball in Indonesian schools can get angry🤣
Incredible👍
Did enyone else notice that At 0:02 he spelled goalkeeper wrong
Where can i buy the last ball that got extreme curve
0:01 goalkeeper spelling wrong LOL
Can f2freesylers goalkeeper save a ball headed straight for them?
https://youtu.be/vcpg50jOabg
Can you stop my father from leaving, *just what i thought*
le cityzen
Can he stop a bullet?
Try a bullet.
What is the song in the background at 7:18 I've been searching for it for ages
This video gave me a lot of ideas to my keepers work. im a handball goalkeeper trainer. and i also have a very good time with the video hahaha thanks!
1+1=100
you could  tell he was having fun
Now use a gun.
you should work on your shooting skills but good vid
Should've tried with a bullet
rUgby
Me who used to play with tennis balls in school football because we weren’t allowed the ball anymore for kicking someone in the nose: ahh yes   (Sorry this was quite long)
Bro you need to learn how to throw a frisbee better.
You should have fallen down in agony. That’s what soccer is. Cmon!
Can he stop a bullet?
captain tsubasa 2018 ^^
Maybe?
Who does this keeper play for?
FCB Club be like : what the keeper name we want him in Barcelona
Not sure what a Goakeeper is, proof reading is pro strats
The keeper's a good sport, getting all the balls.
OMG this man is genzo wakabayashi ! its the live action of the first episode of captain tsubasa
i was buckled at the type 5. the way they move, it's akin to baloons but with more speed.
Great video! Insane safes and funny moments!
he should be a wicketkeeper
Keeper should work in his left
7:58 that doggo
What about badminton
noob
who on earth is this "pro" keeper? can't find out any info on him at all
Cricket ball?
THERE IS SOMETHING WRITTEN ON THE GOAL POST WATCH CAREFULLY IT IS WRITTEN PITCH 2
cant stop my frisbee
10:13 mahn that was just freaking asm..🤩🤩
this part look like Genzo Wakabayashi on Captain Tsubasa lol
he is spider man
Thank god Kyeran plays soccer, If he played something else It would be bad for him xD (it's a joke, don't get offended) Sorry for my lack of grammar, i'm Brazilian, so i know portuguese, i know english too, but not the grammar part of It, i just understand it :P
The second ball is easy🤣
I live in Indonesia
hay vãi
I've played football with basketball... It was a horrible experience after attempting a header... Still haunts me
You to resume the video ? Just with « OOooOooooOo »

Best video 😘 Amazing
আপনি ছাগল
i had the exact same volleyball
👍
Noice
Try Bowling ball🎳🤣
I loved this whole video
All he needs to improve is when the ball curves
A pro keeper could stop anything but a wicketkeeper could stop as well catch anything 😎😎
You're basicly just making him better than he already is 😍
I feel like if he did one with a cricket ball he’d just break his hands
I love how at the start it said goakeeper
The gk is noob
Your so funny
3 words more sad from i hate you Vacation are cancelled
Punten
where is the shot power ???
This was class 😂
10:00 any strikers dream. #unstoppable

#Kieranbrown Love it M8
Like dis comment if u watch Bford
I wanted too do this
at football ok
I love how confident he looks when the tennis ball came 🎾
Good  goalkepper
beautiful saves boi
Good video 👍🏻👍🏻
Is it bad that I’m admiring the waves more than the shots?
If that goal keeper plays for a team what is the team?
A  pro  soo good
Am better than him nomone gets past me in net SIIIIIII
I can not save that
I wanna see you vs the cycling goal keeper 🚴‍♂️!!!
Disappointed, I was waiting for the bowling ball... 😅🤣
It made me laugh but he is a brilliant goalkeeper  Love from india
Let’s try a baseball bat with a baseball
1:26 miren el palo derecho lo q dice
there should be a 1v1 with Dec and the goalie from T obies channel
7:22 anybody know what the name of that song is?
Cool video  Keep it up  Amazing
Imagine at the end he pulls out a gun and the goalkeeper catches the bullet
Yo your both so good!
Can he stop 50’ cal tho??
I think soccer is just the gayest sport ever it's berly even a sport
el profesor de básquet: no pateen la pelota el pibe que quiere recuperar el año en un día: 3:53
come to Vasco da Gama
Can I get a pair of boots
It reminds me of Wakabayashi's scene in Captain Tsubasa 2018😅
I swear I have the same volley ball you have
Satisfying
Can he stop a bullet?
I’ve heard it said that hitting an MLB pitch is the  most difficult thing to do in all of sport.  Those who say this have obviously never tried to defend the vast expanse of a soccer goal.
紅茶會有所不同的感覺，我們的朋友們都在努力不懈的努力不懈努力不懈的努力不懈努力不懈的努力不懈努力不懈的努力不懈努力不懈的努力不懈努力不懈的努力不懈努力不懈的努力不懈努力不懈的努力不懈努力不懈的努力不懈努力不懈的努力不懈努力不懈的努力不懈努力的努力不懈奮鬥歷程嗎⋯⋯這次要怎麼處理這些工作機會？這些東西南北的
Cricket players to tennis balls: Ametuer.
Everything except an asteroid going at the speed of light
What a nice goalkeeping at 7:55
You are disrespectful to basketball I will unsubscribe you
Imagine this guy in, like, elementary school gym class on soccer day.
This video was stupid in a good and funny way lol
10:14 he can really become a wicket keeper mate!!!
That Genzo Wakabayashi scene!
I think on goal some thing
Where did you buy a swerve ball?
0:02 goakeeper?
Very little difference between a "pro" and "intermediate" goalie. There's not much to it. And it doesn't help that professional goalies can't protect 80% of shots in general.  Still interesting and fun video, just kinda pointless
But can he stop a bullet?
That jump with that tennis ball was crazy 10:22
😟😟😟 dis goalkeeper is on FIRE
I meant to say is he a professional soccer player
Is he from professional soccer goalkeeper
As not a pro keeper myself I can confirm I don't know
Is it me or does it seem like he purposely falls on every save
How have I never heard of this channel? This is amazing, great video
Try a bowlingball
He can not stop the ball if its hit by MSD. or Virat..
Can he stop a gun shot or a car
British people get mad when u call it a soccer ball
so first off lol the circle ball is called a soccer ball not a football then the ovovle ball is called a football :D not trying to be rude i live in the us so we call thing's a bit diffrent then you guy's :D
try cristiano ronaldo
It’s a soccer ball ⚽️
Dumb question
Where is cricket ball
The sentence said Can a Goakeeper stop anything  XDDDD
y'all never hear of wakabayashi
Correct me if I’m wrong but is the rugby ball in wherever they live the same ball we use for football in America?
A hockey puck
Wakabayashi in real life
this is the guy i wanna play frisbee with
Can he stop time
you spelt goalkeeper wrong at the start,
I'm bad at soccer (football)
Bowling ball
it really makes me laugh
He shall be a  wicket keeper instead of goalkeeper
https://youtube.com/shorts/4Nb1H2CPMqc?feature=share
The fact that he kicked a volleyball made me cringe so much
pro? i don't think so.
i’m a keeper and i train with foam golf balls i get friends to hit em at u and try and save it
at first i thought the goalie was rolnaldo
As a volleyball player I visibly cringed at the volleyball being kicked, great saves though lmao
That was really cool
I love how the goalkeeper launches himself up to grab the ball.  Its so epic lol
What about an American football 🏈. That could be challenging. Fast, heavy-ish, hard, small, and, if you kicked it, completely unpredictable for the bounces.
0:01 "Goakeeper" might wanna fix that if you can, might be annoying to go back and fix though
Starting intro goakeeper l missing in goakeeper
He is really good at goalie
3 am content
Can it stop my crippling dept
He’s honestly not that good
I know right
This is what I want for myself. A duo of the same skill as me. I am really good at goalie but also really good at shooting. I want someone who can shoot like that so I could play goalie, but I would also want that some person to also be able to play goalie so I can shoot on them. It’s pretty rare to find someone really good at offense and really good at goalie because they are completely different positions, which is why I am weird lol
remember that pro's can also make mistakes because they are also human
remember that pro's can also make mistakes because they are also human
I mean, pro goalkeepers can't stop soccer balls most of the time in one on one battles. So why would something thing they can stop things that can be controlled better?
The Shoot ball we would call "a fly-away" literally unusable even as kids.
Wow how do you save that
its a great very good video
Only a Pro Ultimate frisbee player can stop a frisbee !!! AHAHAHHHH
Can he even cach a house or an toilet
I felt pain when he kicked the volleyball. I know that it was for the video and all, but it hurt🥲
Everyone can be Robertor Calos with the plastics ball😁
You stole my name
Should have gone Dodge Ball on him.  "If you can catch a wrench, you can catch anything!"
He looks like Ronald
I loved this video so much👍🏻
Sir jadeja :- HOLD MY BEER 🍻
My dog can do better than that 🐕
Asdf
QWERTY
It’s not a football it’s a soccer ball!
Do a bullet
Did you just kick a VOLLEYBALL!? Have you lost track of the danger?
9:54 me like: it's cricket time
*pulls gun* how about this?
When the ball hit his face, ouch
I wish BOB Marley was alive so he can play football again
For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment; (2peter2:4) - Because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead. (Acts17:31) For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. (John 3:16-17) Jesus loves you, he's waiting for you to repent and put your faith and trust in Him :) https://youtu.be/uZdv-TtiMkg
I found this satisfying for no reason lmao
I like your atmosphere
3:55  *Every gym teacher gets super triggered*
Creative and an amazing video
This video surely is a fun to watch and quite unique in my youtube account. Laughed, enjoyed and felt good after watching it. Keep it up!
Can a goalkeeper stop a bowling ball shot out of a cannon? 😂
As a volleyball player I felt pain during those volleyball shots.
Very good vid
Real Wakabayashi
Use a Pro kicker too 🤨
I mean.. with that weak ass kick. Even my 5 yo asian step sister can stop it.
The camera man whole of the video:ohhh what a save
That orange curvy ball is like a tornado blowing away a mouse. It’s so curvy!
My name is kieran Evans
Can the goalkeeper stop a wrench. If they can stop a wrench, they can stop a ball!
The first frisbee throw was my favorite
Love your vids
I’m new here. Do you guys play for a team
Fun Fact: Did anyone see at the beginning it said goakeeper
I played with those shoot balls all my childhood
1:37 cameraman in bochan's voice 'SAAIVE'
10:52 When you change the physics of the video game.
As a volleyball player, i hate you now. DONT KICK THE DAMN BALLS
yes but can he stop a cannonball
Volleyball players would be insane goalkeepers
The frisbee’s good practice for goal keepers because they’re harder to get than an actual soccer ball or whatever
" cooking up a save" 🤣🤣
*Pulls out a M82A1/SASR*  Can he stop a 50. Cal, armor piercing round?
What r the goalie gloves hes wearing
you're a very bad striker I must say.
Im waiting for a video "Can a pro goalkeeper stop cannonball?"
Who are him?
Wow.... ❤️❤️ I Really Like This 🔥
In which club you are playing as a Pro?
I am a keeper in real life it is hard

I have a shoot 5 and I was playing while watching

Nice
Barca should replace ter stegan with him
Video litterly says 13 days ago instead 1 week ago WTF🤔
Next try stopping a bullet
He’s clearly weak on the left
That goalkeaper is trassshhhh
Nice video
What's his name..?
Next video: can a professional goalkeeper stop a 9mm bullet
0:01 ah yes "Goakeeper" XD
Goakeeper?
kearean =goat
Wobbla.
Every time you kicked the volleyball it made me cry a little
2:42 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA STOOOOOOOOOOOOP DONT KICK VOLLEYBALLLLLLLLLLLLL
The 99p petrol station floater! Pizzh! Bizzh! Dizzh! That ping sound as it zooms through the air, then goes ⬆️↗️⬇️↘️➡️⬇️↙️⤴️↪↩↔️↕️⬅️⬅️🔃🔄⬅️↗️➡️↘️⬆️, its like ronaldo, carlos, beckham, juninho and ronaldinho all hit the ball at the same time! 😲 Red yellow white blue green silver gold! All bundled in a square netted bin outfront of the garage! 🌞 retro
Definitely good training sesh for gk this one 👍🏻
Aint NOTHING you can do when a 99p petrol station floater comes youre way on as little as a light breeze. Not even Schmeichel and Buffon in the same goal at the same time would stop ol' floaty!
youtube is the best paltfore ever create in man kind. GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YOUTUBE!!!!!!!
Now
2:34
easy
Them shoot 5 balls made everyone fell like ronaldo
Are you Swedish???
If you are a pro keeper why don't you play for a team?
This dude has trouble defending his top left side must imagine he can't even defend the bottom left...
Someone please tell me what song was playing when he got the block with one hand on the tennis ball! :)
Just like Wakabayashi
Oyo i am realy injoy u ar gret golkipar man 💪❤️❤️😘
Pro keeper = Proper
I want to see how hight you can boot it
I'm a rugby player in Ireland
Hi nice oooooooooooo
A proKeeper cant stop a football(:
The question is can they save a bullet 👀
مرحبًا
What would happen if he would have brought hacker goal keeper
It’s called a soccer ball
HE KEEPS THE GOAL
500th disliker But i liked after it
his gk reach is 1000
Great job with saving the balls!!
Can we get a shooting tutorial or jersey collection vid?
Where u take that ball takes nice Around
The taller you are the slower you are
But I quit
And I'm quottz
I wanna say thank you
You liked my comment on tictok in Chelsea vid when Saul was in it
Yo kiren
That’s never a pro goalkeeper
Dec is good at keeper. I’m really good at goalie but Dec is way better. Kieran you motivate me to never give up at keeper
Anyone know the song at 5:20? Great content lads, and quality saves!
Kieran just took everhe could find  at his home.😂🤣
first seen this in captain tsubasa
He's a seriously good keeper, and a good sport. Thanks for the fun video.
You should do a football boot giveaway because you have so much lol
If this video was made by Marty and Michael they would've shot the goalkeeper to test if he can also catch a bullet
Kieran isn't pro keeper as shown in thumbnail. We got click baited 😢
Who is this pro keeper guy  ?
Where did you leave bro
What about bullet
Love it
His goalkeeping is really amazing
He can stop a ball, but can he stop a lorry? *vsauce theme plays*
I am happy he used a volleyball as a soccer ball
Seems that they wanted to imitate Genzo Wakabayashi way to stop ANYTHING.
They typed goakepper
Found this channel back after 3 years
Brilliant video as always!
extreme
Lmao my recommendations after rocket league are real football related now
Congrats to everyone who found this comment.
Now try a cannon ball
I feel the tennis ball to be the easiest #cricketforlife
11:06 THAT'S TSUBASA DRIVEE SHOOOOOOOTTTT
who is the goalkeeper?
Kieran is awful at other sports lol
Goalkeeper: Saves the ball Camera man: “Save”
Soccer players when there's no soccer ball in the cart during PE
Are you swedish
Is it just me or does anyone else want to eat the triangle football
Try with a 9mm
look how he passed all the exams!!!
The tennis ball saves were so satisfying
A Goalkeeper might stop anything But IDK about Gaokeeper mate....(To everyone wondering what I mean check 0:02)
What is the name of the goalkeeper?
It’s insane how good he is at soccer
I feel like goal keepers and very underrated
Give the tennis racket to a tennis player, and that one will be a lot harder. ;)
Need the cycling gk
What gloves is he wearing
Good vid
7:10 waht is the ball ?
The goalkeeper stays more calm when he takes the ball in the net than the striker could not concede the goal.
my guy should've been a wicket keeper with that catching ability damn
You wrote Goakeeper
Weak shot of normal ball. Fact: he didn’t save
A German Goalkeeper: Yes. An English one cant even stop most footballs.
I wonder if you could use the rugby ball as a better reaction ball
Cycle
Kepa is scarred he is going to loose how job after that
Can I pls have a link to buy the shoot balls pls🙏🥺🥺
POV: the basketball had no air in it lol
What boots do you have and how much do they cost
bruh he caught a frisbee
its "soccer" get mad
Genzo 😁
Q14
Can Pro Keeper save Ole Man Utd job THINK 🤨🤨🤨🤨
Use a golf club
BRO THAT VOLLEY BALL LOOKS LIKE MINE
The oven gloves were so funny😆😆😆😂😂😂
Wooohoooo
leave the tennis ball part to wicket keepers
No one cares
Damm, this guy should be in the premier league. That was some great goalkeeping .
let him catch a car going 200 mph, see if he can catch that
I have the same boots
Captain tsubasa!
I was like OUCH when I saw the basketball XD
He is a very good keeper
Can the goalkeeper catch a boxers hand? Lol
😘😘😘😘👌
But can he stop a truck tho?
The philosophy of the rich and the poor is this: the rich invest their money and spend what is left. The poor spend their money and invest what is left
Not even a pro goalkeeper can stop the heat death of the universe.
My kicks can leave a burn on your hand my friend found out  the hard way he plays wing
I hope the 10 people who sees this has a great day and dont look at my name
the training that every goalkeeper wants at some point in his life
Just image you get   “David De Gea
Oven gloves was genius 😂
i wonder if a goalkeeper could stop the train in GTA, or any train for that matter
There's no way he's pro
Ah so thats how they make those fake knuckleball videos 11:00
Where did you get these shoot balls?
Kerion do you  next to cot Lane Park??
All keepers should do this. Great training
Can he stop the sun?
Likely replacement for De Gea
a
i love that the cameraman is treated as a friend and not a worker for u (:
Loved the uppercut save
Amazing video as always! What a keeper 😎
1:15 did anyone notice the SP pitch written on the goal post?
A baseball's ball is probably the hardest to save.
The oven gloves were soooooooooo funnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 😂😂😂
I love the constant whhooooowwwhhhh
As a goalkeeper myself, I can confirm this keeper is incredible
Love you Kieran Brown
For tennis it’d be fun to try and see if he can stop a serve
me: pulls out glock pro goalkeeper: 😳
Pin this if you get tricked. oh and btw   Read more…
If he had a forehand at all the frisbee would have gone in
How many subs can I get from this comment??
Woahhhh😮
Do Basketball
My coach when we are doing goal keeper training will make us train with rugby balls as they are harder to save so then when we get round to using footballs it will be easier
The only thing is for the pro keeper is jump and speed so he doesn't like look at the ball go in
those oven golves tho.....
great vid as per usual kieran. 🙌🙃
That guys not pro hes probably at best semi pro
They said goakeeper instead of goalkeeper
That goal keeper is insane love him
Really loved you video though I was rooting for the ping pong ball but wasn't meant to be
No offence but that's not how you kick a rugby ball coming from rugby player
Cool video
amazing vid mate
Can a pro goalkeeper save a bowling ball?
He can't dive to the left.....
Try to shoot a knuckleball with the orange rotation increaser ball
Should not take God's name in vain.
This goalkeper is week on his left side buth on the right he is very good.I think this kid with hard work he can be the great goalkiper in future
Good keeper💪💪
He looks like Dean Henderson
Yo where do you get those shoot soccer balls?
Pro ? Who the fk is he ? Never heard
Kieren I think if you did a updated boot collection video it would be quite good ( it’s just an idea)
10:14 he’s ultra pro 😌🥰😉😉😉
That was fun to watch
the camera man WOOOOOOAAAAAAHH
in start there goakepper
Wenn man da vorbei schriest dann ist vorbei
spelliinnng
7:28 song?
idek y but i love kieran's accent
The frisbee part was just the keeper diving🤣😂
Too easy
Lovely video
or do you like to play soccer more
Do you like to play volleyball
I love when you kicked the big ball
Your the worst frisbee players
How your foot not broken after hitting that basketball
6:51 yo what did you say kieran? 😂😂
Kieran u go in goal if he no bad lol
9:46 that’s a save or that’s insane?
Title: can a pro goalkeeper save ANYTHING  Keiran: can kick anything
10:14 woaaah
WE LOVE SOME ORIGINAL CONTENT

Captain tsubasa vibes....anyone? just me...allright

If you can catch a wrench you can catch a ball
What's the goalkeeper name

7:41 😭
I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO we got that in the first minute
Kieran pls like this
Make a video on that  keeper saving a nuccle ball
How tall are you?
what cleats are those that u wear
Idc how good the keeper is, anything I can throw is going in 95 times outta 100
The goal keeper wouldn’t stand a chance with a real frisbee player.
That color balloon balls move like the Jabulani haha
This guy literally makes peoples days happy /my last name is brown
We need a falling counter falling counter:1 million times
What is the name of the football with the effect
fire a pro goalkeeper at him and see if he can stop it
7:33 what is the name of the orang ball?
This guy isn’t a pro? What team does he play for
The goal keepers neck reminds me of medium rare steak
The guys literally average
goalkeeper should've cosplayed alisson becker and popped the exercise ball..
He’s not a pro
sooooooo many bots
Kieran has one of the best commentery voices in the world
Can you make how to be a pro/good goal keeper bc I really need it love your vids
kieran should do a #team seas challenge with Ew and Cam where every penalty/freekick they scorte is a dollar towards team seas
Good luck on reaching 2 Millon subscribers ...big fan.
Bro someone scout that guy he's absolutely class his dives are on point brilliant keeper
Has anyone ever told you that you look kinda like Patrick Bamford
10:10 if you want to see a sick save!!!
Your Amazing!! Keep it up
This goalie is amazing top class.
this was honestly the most entertaining thing i’ve seen all week
Anyone know the name of the trousers Kieran is wearing ?
فاک
He calls this guy a pro . Football doesn't exist for them
Don't use GOD's name in vain.
Pe teachers hate u now
How much did you pay the poor lad
Great job keiran brown and ideal gk
I had a shoot ball
Ping pong was very popular in my class when I was a 6th grader( 2017-2018 ) and we sometimes got bored after playing table tennis for too long, so we took the ping pong's ball to be a basketball (because our school have moveable boards and there is gap between the board and the wall, so we use it as the net. We also played baseball and football with it in our free time (we have the 5 minutes one and the 15 minutes one, so we rarely played football besides P.E classes). And the guy who's usually the "goalkeeper" had the chance to be in the football's team representative at Singapore :D
The oven mitts look like handcuffs
Can you pls do a video on the Jordan football boots
Can you just like find these on Amazon or smthn
He has Linx gloves
i love it but, can a goakeeper save anything lol
That's cap
Your quishtin is bad and u making done of him
Hahah joke on you. As goalies we start as young as 10 training with medicine and tennis balls.
What football boots is Kieran wearing ? Someone please tell me
Orange Devil
can someone help me, what is the name of that ball that is after the tennis ball and before the keeper switched gloves?
No
If it was £1 everytime they said save I'd be a TRILLIONAIRE mate 🤣
Y is the keeper so dramatic
Where did he get the shoot 5 balls from
no one talking bout the "Can a Goakeeper stop anything?"...
What are those boots you are using called
KIERAN please ask him what the name of his gloves are and tell me please i really want to buy them
It was funny
Save anything he can
Pro….?
Kieran have you ever played rugby? Do you follow it?
Everything you didn't kick doesn't count.
11:00 who elses school buys these
cheering for the exercise ball, but it wasn't to be... ⚽
Just not a pro keeper is he
Im a keeper and my right is my weak side i cant dive there or just save a goal
Pulls out barret 50 cal  stop this
You gotta love the Sunday league pitches as a goalkeeper
Let's call it "The Wakabayashi Test"
0:49 whyyyy :(
What's the name of the song at 4:00?
12:04 GOALKEEPERS IN PRISON
I love the cameraman talking behind.
Dog at 7:59 tried to join the party
mans knucle balling a huge bouncy ball
But can he stop my parents divorce?
Omg!😮😮 damn person!
Good videos

Am i the only one that heard ksi at 0:00
Kieran your recent uploads have been banging. Been on the top 5 for trending the past few videos. Keep up the good work 🔥
how do u kick a basket ball
10:14 this is rarely ever done in cricket itself mate, though in cricket its a Cork ball but still.
He is good goalkeeper
Pause the vid at 5:44  thats impressive
https://youtu.be/kEGWPv9oCbk
Song at 7:13
this is one of the best vids 😂
go to a football team like man city, liverpool or others and see if you can train the keepers on their training ground
Maybe Kieran should have grubbered the rugby ball
Kieran: should be more accurate  Also Kieran: *goes over the bar*
Where can i buy the swazz ball?
As a frisbee player i am slightly disappointed with the skill levels. Maybe a Brodie Smith collab in future for some mean content?
Love the content keep up the good work!!!
Can you do a top 100 goals ?
https://youtube.com/shorts/xUwgzAW3nQ8?feature=share
I love your vids Kieran! They’re so unique!
Good hardwork in this kierran
I literally can't stop smiling from watching this
The man never fail to entertain us 👍👍👍
U can try cricket ball    Btw use helmet and ped and glows
No one dislike
That rugby shot was mad
Cal the dragon wouldn’t of let one in the whole video. Pro by 25 pal
what boots are those
whats the song at 7:30
I used to play ultimate frisbee but instead of endzones we used footy goals with keepers, hella fun.
Do a three pointer
Dec's actually class though
I love how eveytime the ball goes so high in the air he tries to catch it
Noob: soccer ball  Pro: Basketball ball  Hacker: Football ball  Legend: ping pong ball  God: Plastic ball
10:42 Can someone please tell me where I can find this ball 🙏
What shoes are they
Mate just watching Dec keep, makes me wanna be a keeper. I mean I’m not a keeper and don’t think I will, but I thinks it’s very good for young kids getting into football. ❤️ the vids
Gotta enjoy these reactions of OHHH or AAAAH
Omg Dec is so good.
Look at the dog at 7:50
DEC like the white mendy no racism 😁 huge respect 👏 to you and DEC.
I knew this was coming out ideal GK was at your pitch
I actually use tennis balls in practice
4:47 did he really said: "das war nicht schlecht"? Since when he speaks German 😂
💥💥💥💥💯💯💯
7:21 Song name?
nice kieran
Him: kicking basketball   Me: But my gym coach how
Hes not pro tho
Great video content mate
Kan du prata svenska svara
Love your videos
He's a keeper
I play mini football with a tennis ball all the time because my school has a rule that a certain class gets the football cage per playtime
The goalie is not that good
Song at 07:20 ?
3:23
It's so satisfying when Kieran scored those top scorers and when the keeper SAVED the top bins shots; You're the best YouTuber ever💯🤩
Do you live in the UK Cuz I do
That save with the tennis ball was pure FILTH
I was actually laughing out loud at this one.
Amazing thanks!!
Awesome
Joe mama
Love your vids
He is dead good people say I'm the best goalkeeper In my school what about yours
I'm a goalkeeper and I play ultimate frisbee!😅
This vid earned u a sub
Love how dedicated and hard working you are, never a bad video   My number 1 youtuber for sure ❤️
I need to send you a better frisbee
You should’ve got a hurl and a sliotar would’ve made him shit the load lol
This man deserves more than 1 million subs
Could I get that basketball? Very special because it was kicked by Kieran
That was so fun to watch
The goalkeeper is so good
Can a pro keeper stop anything?  What about poverty, or hunger, how about COVID-19?
I'm a rugby player and when you grubber it which means like a hitting the side and sits on the floor it's quite hard to catch respect for the gk
How are you that good?😃
It pains me my boy Kieran has been in the pitch for more minutes that Donny Van De Beek
For my high school tryout my coach, who was also the tennis coach, shot on us with a racket
This goalkeeper is better than most F2 goalkeepers, matter of fact he's better than most goalkeepers
where is this? I'm in Hertforshire and its so dark
When he said “I’m a half decent goalkeeper now I’m baking cakes,” omg I almost died 😭😭😭
This really made me laugh 😅 Love it Kieran!
i said you this keeper is a alin 12:36
HACKER HACKER  😱😨😰 11:20

How's the ansly Wood football pitch kieran
What a keeper ⚽️
Yeah
You should of made him save water bottles 😂
He should use this for training
What team does he play for? Does anyone knows? Some of the save he did was pretty insane for a non top flight league goalkeeper.
You need to do more videos with air floaters!
Super and so funny
