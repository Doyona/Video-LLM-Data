This keyboard instrument is ill
What is the name of the song I want to learn it?
John Cage had specific instructions and technique to prepare one. Tom Constanton the short term keyboard player for the dead introduced it to their sound in 1969.
I love Mozart’s sonata facile
You guys need to team up with other piano mad-scientist, @Mattiaskrantz
people who say it sounds worse yall got ZERO taste
Nice rocket ship dust drawing
He sounds like airrack

"After an hour of screwing the pia6we were almost done"💀
“She don’t like the long skinny ones she likes short fat ones”💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
some kid could have learnt on this while.. they take nails and a hammer to it
What song did they play at the end?
A kid out there could have been the next Chopin. But this is way more funnier
You should play 1000 miles while the piano is on truck.
So you ruined a piano
“After an hour of screwing the piano” yeah I kinda did that too just without the piano and with your mo-
Has very strong Fosters for Imaginary Friends vibes. I love it.
Sounds like an old saloon piano. Love it
Wait but do this but only the music for my ringtoneXDXD
The only thing I can describe this as is...  3 adults that look somewhat like a kid, a drunk hillbilly, and a broken Harry Potter.  That are for some reason talented on a piano, decides to screw screws into a piano they got for free at a local bar...   If you told this to someone they would freak the fuck out.
This is something you’d do with the boys for no reason
Love it
Who’s the guy in the Beatles shirt?
Why?
Sounds like there's a bunch of shit in the piano...
play clown music on it.
That sounds awful
Cough. Piano is ill
Got a trout mask replica vibe at the end.
bars in the 1800s be like
Y’all got the best deal on one of those pianos, free
Lol sounds like the piano 🎹 from the carnival 🤣 xxx👍👍👍👍
Literally had a similar day with my buddy one time. Picked them up in his 84 chevy and I sat in the back while we drove through towns. Idk what he ever did with that thing!
What's the name of this tune
Sounds like the piano in the dingy bar I don't go to.
Watched this a year ago and didn’t remember but I came to the comments to leave the same post I left already…
That piano is sick in such a way that it needs put down.  Oddly enough though, it does actually sound pretty cool. I thought this was satire
Fucked up the piano could have donated it to someone who has been learning to play
Nothing says Thank You like fucking up their door on the way out..
Lol, love they left it in the truck to dump it somewhere 😤😂
The 1 dude looks like the dollar store version of Logan Paul
Im getting wild west saloon vibes from the piano
Is that Ben? 😮
So after an hour this Piano was screwed
“After an hour of screwing the piano” 🤨
That poor piano.
It actually sounds good
wow, the internet is so weird haha. first, i see a lot of unfunny memes, then i see a piano get screwed!
hehehehe pp
I think Old Time Rock and Roll would sound pretty cool on that piano
Play great balls of fire
It looks so tired
Well they sure screwed that up
Turns out the bar only put up the sign to say its free to play...
The fact they got a free piano was insane.
Sounds horrible
Sounds pretty good at the end
Trash asf
Pretty cool kind of reminds me of the sound of the pianos and old western movies at The Saloon
Sir did you just say "after an hour of screwing the piano"?
Mf where do you go to find a free piano!?
For a min I heard the charle brown theme song
So it just sounds like a cheap out of tune shitty piano.
What song is this
Nice drawing 😂
So stupid... Yet so... Intriguing
Call a piano repair guy and record his reaction
He turned a piano into a pian-e
I think this was one of the first YT Shorts I ever saw. Nice to see it again
Logan paul?
"Just because you're unique doesn't mean you're useful". I will say,  that prepared piano is very punk rock. In the same way that punk rock music is just raw expression from people void of talent.
So in other words, a comically large guitar but with keys to strum the chords.
Sounds like shit. Great job!
We need to hear some ragtime on that
Sounds god awful idk what ur talkin bout
It just sounds like a shitty piano. Almost like someone shoved nails and screws in between the strings and stuff...
I am offended… that he didn’t play making my way downtown while he was on the truck
Thats weird i like it😂❤😊
Play fallen down undertale on it
The lord is so so good repent and you shall be saved
play thomas the tank engine
Pain
Prepared? You mean ruined?
not me thinking it was playing itself in the back of the truck 😭
can yall prepare a steinway?
Looks like a fun day with the Bois
Sounds like a song that would be in fallout 4 Ngl
You can’t make a piano sound any better with nails 😂
What's the song he played.
Did he draw a   ))====}   On the piano?
Sounds like shit, but still was cool to watch🪳🪳🪳
Insane
The most mesmerizing thing here is that you found two other human beings nearby who enjoy playing piano, and actually befriended them.
sounds fire
If you have ever used the bandlab beat maker, this sounds like the honky tonk piano
Damn you screwed that piano hard
All that work just to destroy it in the end
Yo what’s that one dudes name in the flannel and was this in New Jersey
This piano could be worth 10 to 11 grand
Wish I could have a piano😭 to expensive for me
Only in America you can find a completely free piano..
Please fix that horrendous sounding piano
Anyone know what was that last song they were playing?
"After an hour screwing the piano"
They never u strapped it or off loaded it cus they prolly threw it in the dump right after this video lol
It literally just sounds out of tune… you could have randomly loosened and tightened strings and achieved the same result I think
Do the snooping theme song from charlie brown movie
Hmmm What iffff You pour this sauce on a pizza?
That's a funny looking nail 🤔
Western cartoon moment
Ive been working for two years to buy a piano and im just half way through But these guys take a free piano like its nothing...  I mean... FUCK
And now it sounds like shite
Why that remind me of Charlie brown
I LOVE THAT
I would kill for a piano
"After an hour of screwing the piano"
Cool
Damn, you really screw the piano
Kinda sounds like your playing a case of doorbells. 😇
He'll yea..piano and corona
You guys should post an actual full some from what ur friends played because it was fire
Don't even have to do that, just get an extremely old, and out of tune piano, and you're good
Add on a starter and a parking break and you wont even have space for the floor!
bruh a kid in africa couldve eaten that piano smh
That guy really tried to twist off a corona 🤣 what a dumbass
Sounds like 💩
"Hold on, let me tune my piano real quick"
This is not good for any piano
That last song had me in a cartoon
What is that song they played at the end?
Is no one mentioning they broke it in the beginning part of the video?
Thought that was Logan Paul in the beginning
Thanks for wasting my time the short is so stupid
Charlie Brown vibes
Dude tried to open a rona with his hand
I need some friends like that man
Logan Paul lite😂

Gonna party likes it's 1888
It sounds like an old song
when you have no clue what a prepared piano is.
Hipsters
Love it. Also would never do that to my piano. Partly cuz I don't trust myself. Still it's great to know how that sound was achieved
After an hour of screwing the piano 💀💀

“After an hour of screwing the piano”

I wish I had a piano 😭 all i have a a 6 year old key bored and it's really beat up
More like unprepared piano.
It sound surprisingly good
Honestly, sounds cool
It's not even special, just less good than normal
Thank you John Cage, the original piano tinkerer and master of silence
Man I need that full song at the end of the video on the same piano
Shit like this is tough to see. Not having access to things like that growing up and you get a free piano and smash it for likes.
John Cage smiles upon thee
This would be like me claiming that I can play a synthesizer just because I may own one
*awful*
Playing that one about falling down the stairs never sounded so good!
My friends and I
Put the piano on the truck on go onto the high way
This sounds painful
Bro that piano sounds like a old vintage 1920 piano
Was that tegan and sara at the end?
the moment i heard that song at the end- the frickin- THATS THE DIARY FO A WIMPY KID MOVIE SONG-
redneck music :>
What if the piano was just free to play and they stole it
Ok, but why break it tho. Seemed fine to me
i tried to take this piano to the doctor. he told me this piano is too sick with it, there's no cure
Here I am wanting to be a musician struggling to get funds for an atleast $150 but some fuckin drunkards get a whole bar piano for free. I would kill for a piano like that man. I woulda dragged that shit home myself
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
sounds like a samsung ringtone and i mean that in a good way
That sounds ace
Now it's off to the dump
You know the song they played remind of something  Foster home for imaginary friend!?!?
Mf ruining the piano  - a flute player
FUCK YEA .sounds like a bar in the cowboy days
"When We We're  Screwing This Piano"💀
At first i was thinking "dude, you're just going to break it"  I was wrong. Big wrong. That sounds cool af
Why don't you record a song from it with the nail
The end sound like from diary of a wimpy kid
That just sounds like shit... Like ya my sponge would be unique if I left it to fester in a bucket of piss for 3 days, but that wouldn't make it better...
Can this damage the piano?
Sound like a piano 🤣🤣
Like why am I still seeing this I've been watching this video for like a year🥺
Sounds like a drunk man walking home 😂
They missed the chance of playing 1000 Miles on the back of the truck
You got a piano for free, but couldn't take the time to carefully remove it? Just giggle when it slammed into the door?
It sounds like a Western movie
That piano is screwed up
It sounds like the piano from rdr2
red dead 2 ?
Oh wow dude I never knew
Why
You should of played A thousand miles when you were playing the piano in the trunk
Bruh. My girlfriend actually plays piano and i messaged that exact bar on fb for the piano and they said it was gone…
this is awesome. it sounds like it should be playing in a saloon in RDR2
How to f*ck up a sh*tty piano
what that just a random song you made up or is it a real song?
it sounds shit 😂
Sounds worse than it did before
Bro I would’ve bought that piano from you
Screw pops out right in the kisser
What song were they playing at the very end?
Whats the spng they play at the end called
" that's pian-oh I said pian-nee!"
“After an hour of screwing with the piano we were getting pretty close” bro?
I was supposed to be a concert Penist. Then I realized I had fins.
Sounds Beatles ish at the end
Plipitty ploopity ploop ploop
Find it funny you never took it out of the truck so you can take it right to the dump when you’re done.
I don't get it. Now it sounds like shit
I mean, it just sounded shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like a loading screen lol
Who else heard a bit of the yiay theme
Sounds like you ruined a perfectly good piano….
Is the video below this edited orrrr?
i wanna take a piano, put it in the bed of a truck, and play it going down a street
What a dumb thing to do.
You sound like Jake Webber
Now play the fosters home for imaginary friends theme sing
She don't like the long skinny ones....she like dem short fat ones
it actually sound good.
I can't imagine doing all that work for something that sounds awful.
Why do you want to make the piano sound bad?
I'm so happy that free piano got in your hands. Imagine if some youtuber would take it to make some dumb video instead...
what's the name of the song in the end if it's an actual song? :)
after a hour of screw what now
Wow, sounds just like a piano that's out of tune. So Cool...
i was expecting the thomas the tank engine them tbh
I want to screw a piano
reminds me of a piano in an aphex twin song
Trash 🗑
Name of the song at the end? Please?
Oh that's funny
screwing around again ey? ;)
How dare u do that to a PIANO!!?
At first glance I thought the other dude was Logan Paul…..only me?….ok😭😭
I know this isn’t about a piano but that’s a sick Ford Ranger!!
Is that Charlie brown
The piano has been drinking. Not me
Its sad to see someone handeling an instrument so carelessly, people put a lot of hard work in building a piano like that and many would wish to have one but arent so lucky and just get it for free like you.
This sounds like shit
I appreciate the beers on top of the piano!
Need that as a Soundfont.
That actually sounds good!
Plot twist: the FREE sign means it's free to use in the bar, not to TAKE IT AWAY
yooo that so cool logan paul in your video lmfaooo
“I like long skinny one”   u like what ???
Free fucking piano ? In eu u have to spend like 20k to get cheapest one
Did you try metal thumbtacks on the tips of the hammers?
please don't put the screws in like that 😱😱😱 it will ruin the piano. you need to first lift the damper and then use a mute wedge to move the strings out of the way to then put the screws in. ik that you guys didn't care about that piano, but others that see the video might want to do the same. also please don't scratch the soundboard with the tip of the screws
That sounds awful
Bass piano
This is so american. Taking a decently working instrument and ruin it to make a worthless video.
Sounds like total shit
fun fact: if a string snapped it would have enough strength to slice your neck off fully 🥰
What a waste of a perfectly decent piano
Looks like the Wish Version of Logan Paul
"We took this old piano and made it sound like shit"
Hes profile picture is how im feeling right now
sounds like shit ngl
Sounds great man
“she don’t like the long skinny ones”   “she likes them short fAt ones”
This sounds like shit.
This is how to turn a piano into fire wood
“She don’t like the long skinny ones… she likes the short fat ones” 🤨
But why it didn't sound any cooler
Uh....it sounds just like I expected it to bro.  Like shit.
It sounds like a accustic guitar
I cant even believe that this guy would screw up a good piano especially when he got it for free. So screwed up. Absolutely twisted. However, upon observation, he did nail the piano solo
So you made it worse. Well done.
That blonde dude looks like Milky from the film Me Myself and Irene
The dissonance that is occurring makes me sad. At the very least make the nails aligned the same wtf.. D;
Were they drinking Topo Chico
quick question what truck do you drive
I swear the end song sounded like a diary of a wimpy kid movie intro song  Anyone else agree? 👇
Sounds like Another one by mac
This kind of sounds like something you’d use to make a mock old timer movie.
Can anyone tell what that little melody is at the end? i want try learn it right now
Sounds like an old honky tonk piano
“After an *hour of screwing the piano.* “
What’s the name of that last song?
Who would not take a free Piano!!
It sounds like if a banjo and a piano has a baby
You nailed it 👏👏👏👏
Some how it sounds better
It sounds wrong and right at the same time
Every piano in a western movie be like:
Yep, sounds like shit
This reminds me of cod zombies a lil
sounds like shit
Went from sounding like a nice Irish pub song to creepy carnival. Cool?
Him: after two hours of screwing the piano me: wut
Please don’t ruin pianos
I wish the piano went so someone who would’ve actually used it instead of destroy it
All of the dead best classical music composers: WTF WHAT IN THE PIANO GODS NAME THESE 21IST CENTURY MEN DOING
We need music on this piano
"After an hour of screwing the piano we were getting really close to the final product"
Absolute sacrilege lol.
so cool
Nice drawing😮‍💨
This is jist claasic man
What was the song at the end of the clip?
Anyone else see my man’s trying to screw off the cap of the corona 🤣 must be his first time
You could've took it out the truck at least
You know its gonna turn out good when everyone is drinking beer while building something
BRO THAT'S DOPE CRAP
You huys seem like you like trucks
I can't decide if it sounds cool or not
Nailed it
Lmao did they leave it in the truck so they could just take it to the dump after this vid
Didn't mention John Cage (where prepared instrumentation comes from) kinda disappointed bro
"Without the knowledge of the YouTubers they destroyed a rare piano that is priceless" 🤣🤣🤣 that'd be terrible
🔥 🔥 🔥
Bro what's the name of the song they played at the end
It sounds like the intro from diary of the wimpy kid movie
What was that song in the last scene SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME
The nails didnt do shit .. Sound was nicer before
Nigga killed a damn piano, and for what
Imagine how many people played it that could be dead now
Mf got that wiki wiki wild wild west piano
Everts 1880s saloon
But why
No one saw that guy try to twist off the beer and play it off lol
As a part of the Asian community this is a disgrace
Sounds like when you wanna make music sound dark and twisted, like when a character discovers something isnt quite right. For example: if Coraline when she found the other dad, the music he was playing sounded like that and was slower it would have a nice big impact
You might want to take the piano to the hospital if it's sick
I thought that was logan Paul
It starts to sound worse as it also sounds better
The vaguely ragtimey song at the very end sounds a lot like (pretty sure it isn't, but it sounds like) a song from the old live-action Pippi Longstocking movie XD great vibes, now I need to watch that again
Sounds like you just got a piano and fucked it up.
Heretic.
Logan Paul
Why 😭
Sounds like a beat in the old west world in plants vs zombies 2
Man looks like garf
Let me guess 2008 Ford Ranger sport with full cabin.
Beethoven is rolling in his grave rn 💀
I love the dumb friend energy.
Y break it tho
Sounds better than I expected
I thought this was a joke but that actually sounded sick
so cool!
It sounds like a Wes Anderson film
After an hour of screwing the piano we were getting really close
That aint even sick bro, that thing on lifesupport xd
I’m shocked that it doesn’t sound bad, I kinda thought this was a bit hahah Reminds me of old cartoon soundtracks
Screws in piano: rdr2 saloon music
Put them on some hauschka shit
Fire
I want to hang out with these people
''thats what ot sounds like''...well it sounds like shit
When you said the piano is sick I took that literaly
As a music producer this hurts to see lmao
screwing the piano Sounds fun 😏⃤​
Sounds like kanye
“Its kinda beat up and gross but we decided to take it”   Bro it’s literally free
What were you playing at the end?
Make it stop
Kids that’s just apple juice not beer it’s apple juice
This isn't better but it's not worse i think in the right hands this is great
Whoever gets it is gonna take all the nails out and sell it for like 500$
Hell yes bro
Love it man, it sounds like I’m in the 30’s 40’s.
For some reason I feel like that's the perfect sound to play Thomas the tank engine song
Sounds like something that would be played in the peanuts movie
Logan paul looks a bit different these days
So you basically took turns over screwing the piano
“She doesnt like long skinny one”
Song in the end Sounds like family business
Cage did it before
Sounds like a piano from those wild west movies
Whats the name of the song they played?
Was he playing the peanuts theme at one point???
Nobody is going to talk about the swinging man on the roof
How come someone gives a piano for free?
I did this, finally got it back to my place, took me a few hours finally get it all set, and then I realized I can’t play piano
Got that great value Jake Paul
It's when you completely ruin an otherwise perfectly functional piano.
Sing bings ship from one piece with the piano
Getting som rdr2 vibes. Nice
Meh
Free piano??
Sounds like shit
I love screwing the piano
Sounds like shit
Dude tried twisting the cap off that corona lol
"That's piano! I said play us some 𝘱𝘪𝘢𝘯𝘺!!"
is that mr Logan paulllll
When you know he was playing the first movement of Mozart’s Sonata 16 😂😭
Yo man i need that sic melody you guys played at the end asap, name your price
It sounds fucking horrible.
Making a piano sound like a guitar
Booze for scale
Is it just me or "DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON ME IM ALREADY THE VOICE INSIDE MY HEAD"
Dude made a Guitar Piano, literally
The cast of trailer park boys
Wish places near me gave out free pianos
You missed the chance to play "1000 miles" while driving along the road
Kid: mom can we get logan paul? Mom: we have logan paul at home. Logan paul at home:
Pianos sound good with clear packing tape on the strings where the hammers hit. You should try it
Sounds like the beer they are drinking, utter garbage
_sacriligeous_
Finally done of putting nails in the piano      *it sounds like Charlie Brown intro*
Screwing the piano...wow
Love how their drinking and doing all this with the piano still in the back of the danger ranger
Prepared for the junkyard
the flu?
Love the cock drawing in the dust!!!!!! Got to be done!!!
Bro it sounds like it was supposed to be in a old  Mickey Mouse  film
Bro it sounds like it was supposed to be in a old  Mickey Mouse  film
“After hours of screwing the piano”
Honestly i think it still sounds cool
I'm not sure how to feel abt this lmfao
BRUH 1860S TYPE PIANO LMAO
Southern logan paul cant hurt you:   Southern Logan paul:
2:34
Some how you find a free piano and absolutely destroy it. Shame should have gone to someone who would have appreciated it instead of destroying it
I love it but wouldn't the vibrations between the screws and the string cause them to rip apart after some years of playing?
Sounded better without the nails
Anyone know the song at the end?
Diary of a wimpy kid vibes
Hillbillys and musicians unite
Bruh
I would say they "nailed it", but even that joke is a bit screwy.
Living room song?
Sounded a lot worse, to me... Not better.
Reminds me of a few old cartoons with how it sounded, I quite enjoyed it
And of course, this couldn't be an american video without a mustang hidden anywhere
It sounds like a horror piano
It sounds like a horror piano
Western pianos be like:
It kinda sounds like, ragtime-y now with the nails. But I have to agree with some of the others in the comments, this is piano abuse
Why did you disrespect their door like that?
They said leave it in trunk so we don’t have to put it back and throw it away
So this is what the music class kids do after graduating highschool
damm it's a string instrument now
The title should have been 1890 vibes
Can't believe Logan Paul is in this video
Pain...
Tom Waits would love this
Sounds like it's asking for you to kill it lol
Ok but you had a piano in the back of a pick-up and didn't sing "A Thousand Miles"
What song did he play on the piano?
Bro he went to the wild west
This is the idle hour in point pleasant nj. I go there on a very regular basis.
I thought that was Gart in the ballcap! Lol  -party on wayne.
You should drive around and one you plays it
You made a piano a guitar
Sounds like shit
Now why does that sound like the ending to diary of Wimpy kid?😏
“After screwing the piano for an hour”
That’s cool, but I’m more impressed with the ranger. I love the older body styles!
That sounded like shit
"the boys on a Saturday afternoon"
Terrible
Is that an actuall song if its not please make it
Ol buddy wants to be Logan so bad 😂
It really shows how when we see dusty, Flat surfaces that can be drawn on. We always go for the dick drawing.
It sounds like an old cowboy saloon piano
Hehe. A pianist drew a pianis
As a former pianist myself, I can say that, on one hand, it's pretty cool, on the other hand...  Murder incoming
They nailed it!
Is no one going to talk about how they got a FREE piano?!
Poor piano
Bro they turned a piano into a guitar
I thought it was logan paul for a second.
_John Cage approves_
as a person who loves pianoes, this made my blood go beyond boiling. my blood is now plasma.
The penis was a nice touch.
They pretty much made a piano banjo
Now it’s ready to go back to bar lol
Kinda shit…
The fact that you didn’t play “1000 miles” on a piano in the back of a moving truck was a missed opportunity that you will be regretting for the rest of your lives
Why?
I wish I had a free piano wtf
Pianjo
I like how they left it in the bed of the truck to go dumb it after the video🤣🤣
It sounds bad
This could be a horror game theme
I like how you just went straight to work, didn't even bother taking it off the truck first lol
"so, it's better?" "Actually, the opposite" "Then why?"
Fuck now i am the old man
honestly i cant tell the difference but im stupid as duck
“after screwing the piano” what do you mean by that🤔
Why is the blonde long haired band member the same person from that delivery app ad all over YouTube? Ya'll really got that dude in the band? Lmfao
Sheeesh these guys need drugs
Is it just me? That sounds like shit lol
"after screwing the piano for an hour" Uh..
Sounds like absolute shit
What is the name of the song at the end
Love how you guys kept in the bed of the truck, cause we all know its going to the dump right after
Poor piano, hope it gets better soon
That's amazing
when they played the piano after putting the nails i somehow got avgn vibes
Wouldn't work without the beer
Just sounds like its not tuned
did he just say after screwing the piano?!?!?!? AYOOO
Does it need some medicine
I SAW HIM DRAW SOMTHING????
As a current pianist, there’s a difference between a prepared piano and what you did. John Cage created the song “Prepared piano” by using specific measurements and depths. To recreate his piece, you must follow his set instructions. This is, however, a cool project if you have a broken piano that has no use later!
Bro at the end it was like when you would walk in the saloon in the 18 hundreds
That’s awesome!
Play great balls of fire by jerry lee Lewis on this PLEASE
That song at the end is nice. What's it called?
If I were to buy this would I also get the Ranger or is it just the piano
That shit sounds fucking horrible
make me one
it sounds really good                      i like it alot
This makes me sad as a pianist.. if u did this to a grand piano, I would cry
You just messed up a perfectly Good antique piano
Sounds the same
Do you have a full channel or just a shorts channel?
Who the hell gives away a Piano for free?
Its sick? ..damn .. i hope it gets well soon .. my Prayers goes out to the Chord Family
Kinda sounds like doodoo
F you guys for actually making this sound good
ꇙꄲ꒤ꋊ꒯ꇙ ꇙꄲꊰ꓄ꏂꋪ
What's that song you play at the end. It's quite catchy and has that fosters home kinda feel.
I love how they're just day drinking and fucking around with a piano. Complete vibe
Is that Logan paul
is one of your friends logan paul? if not, they look really close
That’s awesome! It sounds like the piano AND acoustic music you’d hear in an upbeat ending or beginning of an episode from a comedy.
What was that last beat tho
Thizz is sick
Sounds terrible
Bro I actually realy like the sound of it, it sounds like something from a tim Burton movie
So sick it didnt even make it out of the truck 🤣 just right to the dump
Why?
Please don’t use words like “lure”😂
WHO THE HELL JUST GIVES AWAY A PIANO?!?
Play Rush E on it
nahhhh I hate it lmao
Sounds much worse
This is a real "me and the boys" video
So it sounds like shit now, good job.
Sounds like a really really old recording
They have no idea what this is do they. The amount of money they just lost by destroying it is satisfying the stereotype they clearly fall into.
This is my favorite
Peen-iano
hell naw that's for free
Give it to me
sounds like shit
What’s the song tho
You should play stardew valley music
I’ve seen this 3 time already.
Im not mad that you wasted my time. Im sad that you wasted so much of yours.
Screwing the piano
I love it is sounds awesome especially the song at the end what’s the name of the song please????????? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
I'm be back after 9 months
Poor piano you bastards
You sound like airrack.
It sounds like it would be perfect if you did the Charlie brown intro theme.
An hour of work to make it sound like shit.
Wish Logan paul
My mans looks like great value Logan Paul
It sounds like it should be in Stardew Valley at the end.
Sounds like a nickelodeon piano.(not the tv network)
F
As a piano rebuilder it hurt my soul when you hit the action of that upright with a hammer
wait what song did they play at the end it sounds like it belongs in omori
"she don't like 'em long and skinny, she like 'em short and FAT"
I feel like it’s a tradition to draw a penis on any dusty surface
After an hour of screwing the piano 💀 My brain
Excellent job gentleman❤️🇨🇦 sounds absolutely beautiful
Sounds fun
What's the song at the end?
Waste of a piano
ah yes I love screwing pianos
This hurts.. but cool nonetheless!
I didn't know a ranger was so capable
Sounds like shit 😅
Ur freind looks like a country side logan paul

Busin
10/10
The song at the end sounds like it would be from diary of a wimpy kid
She doesn't like long and skinny ones she likes short and fat ones got me laughing
It literally hardly even sounded different
All I know is where the fuck did you get a free piano from? I fucking wish I saw a piano with a sign that said free!!
Its sounds good
What was that they were playing on the piano at the end cus it sounds amazing
On the contrary, it sounds awful to me. Lol.

Fisher Price Logan Paul?

Your neighbors must have hated you that day, playing that in the driveway 🤣
They look like a Dollar store Timothee chalamet and Logan paul. But sick the piano

Now i want to see them ride around the neighborhood while playing that piano
I will keep you safe in my heart… poor piano
Cool but uh did you really have to fucking take a hammer to it after,
Sounds disgusting
Rocket 🚀
Love it
The end sounded like the song Mr. Pitiful
now it sounds like a school piano
people who start sentences with "As" should be executed for treason
I don't know why, but I dig it
Honestly sounds like a ragtime piano
Shit I'mma go make that new attachment too, looks like it takes a bit but hey, that piano trunkbed upgrade looks aerodynamic and great at car meets
That sounds... bad.
How to make your piano sound like a NIN song.
That’s actually pretty cool
It could have covid
"After an hour of screwing the piano we were getting pretty close"
Sounds like my grandmas old untuned piano lol
Your ruining a perfectly good instrument
This hurts
Sounds like shit😂
Harpsichord
That hat guy looks like logan paul 🤣
Sounds like arse
I hope there's a parallel reality where piano entities break your skull
Something about the sound of the piano instills a terrible sense of existential dread in me.
Lame
That sounds... actually really cool
I feel sorry for your neighbors but still cool
Siiiiick!!!!
What’s the song you guys play at the end
Bunch of….
so you wasted it and didn't even unload from the truck as you wanted to trash it after the video, right?
*immediately draws a dick in the dust* A real dude.
JOHN CAGGGEEEEEEEE
Sounds like shit
Never seen three men screw a piano before!
Sounds like shit
Guys publicly screw a piano without getting arrested
Dose any one know what song they played at the end?
How Houston people play piano chopped and screwed
I hope you can get those screws back out and give the piano to some awesome young piano student who wants to practice at home desperately
Sounds like shit .
Dang should have gave it to a kid or someone trying to learn like I’m sure the bar thought you were gonna do
So.. You made a piano sound shitty?
Is that blonde guy Logan Paul?
😂😂😂😂 yes!!!!!!!!
Sounds like shit man damn 😑
I made a xylophone kinda thing breaking my piano, it was.. scary yet horrorible
The piano has been drinking          [[Tom Waits]]
“After an hour of screwing the piano”  The piano 9 months later- 🤰
So, I’m still not sure what I just watched. As a musician and piano player, I’m not sure what I was expecting but it wasn’t that. But okay.
This feels sacrilegious...
What they played at the end deserves a sub 💯❤️so I gotchu
Thanks for demonstrating why pianos don't have screws stuck in the strings when manufactured.
Great you ruined a perfectly good piano a kid could have used..
that was a huge waste of toke
It kinda sounds like a ramshackle drum set accompanied by a muted piano... Weird but cool
Okay, but it sound even more shit now 😅
How on earth is that “cooler”.. it sounds like actual trash
You just reinvented the Wild, Wild West barroom piano.
what's that song?
Sounds like shit
ive heard that piano strings are tight af and if one breaks it could cut your head off
Honestly if u didn’t have friends around I would have just said that was a waist but it seems like fun
So you just made a regular piano worse?
So sick of sounds like it's dying
He drew a picture of a pianist on a piano!
Bruh🤡
One giant leap backward for mankind
Thats so cool, you guys nailed it. Screw the old piano
Yup. Terrible. Exactly how I thought a prepared piano would sound
Even Helen Keller thinks this sounds horrible
It sounds like shit doesn’t it?
Numerous dick references in this loll
Wack
i love that
Weak. Sounded like shit
That's is really cool
Prepared pianos are made by following a set of instructions that tell you what and where things go, not by just sticking screws between all the strings.
my dumbass realized he drew a dong on the piano
What is the song that you played at the end, reminds me of some movie i watched once but i don't recognize it? Any one know what it is?
You could also run it over with a tractor and get the same effect
How do people have time to do this kinda shit all the time?
Sounds like shit to be honest
Please don't take free stuff and ruin it
What a shame
Just because you’re unique doesn’t mean you’re useful.
Sounded like shit
Ooo
Wtf you almost destroyed the door. That's so disrespectful, that bar is not yours, you should be more careful.
Prepared piano actually sounds very cool especially if you make some strings just sound like percussion. Aphex twin has an album of a bunch of prepared piano songs and he uses it very well
They kept it strapped down the entire time lol
Nice sounds like shit
And then you destroyed it and brought it to a dump. Classy.
Sound cool
So it sounds like shit
sacrilegious
Man you really screwed that piano
Don’t it sound like idle minor tycoon music
sounds sick as FUCK!!!
Put aluminum foil in between the strings & the dampers…  You’re welcome 👽🎹✨
Actually sounds kinda fire.
Pemis

Nice to see Pogan Laul in this vid
I wish me a piano for such a long time, and I don't have the money, and my parents don't want to give me mine, what they bought for me as little kid and I learned playing in it. ... And then I see guy's like you who ruin one so badly and with no sence
No respect for anything. What a generation
Piano was not free. They paid for it and asked if they could add the paper when they picked it up.   L.
“After an hour of screwing this piano”😏
Sounds shit
Didn’t know logan paul could play the piano
It kinda sounds like bango
Come by and jam when you’re in da OC
Sounds bad
I call this screwing with a piano
Ok but i want to know if they stuck their hand in the bucket
Could have just said you were nailing your piano The fuck
This feels like at the end of the game when your playing a level from the near start but it's all broken down and way harder
Bro you should 100% play the breaking bad intro on this thing
Interesting.
He realy madr thqt shape with dust. 🍆
Has this popped up on anyone else’s fyp like 15 times lamo

At the end it sounds like something in pikuniku
Do the Charlie Brown song
Love the Ranger!
ALABAMA!!!!!!
Sounds horrible after
"Here's what it sounds like."   Shit. Like shit.
Sounds like garbage lmao
Trash
It sounds like bass
Logan paul is that you?
I feel so bad for the piano some reason.
As a composer this makes me happy but as a conservator it makes me sad lol
This is horrid. Why would anyone literally destroy a piano like this? And one that didn't even sound bad. What an absolute, pointless waste.
Free piano comes with a broken door.. mongs
What is this song
"We made a piano sound like shit"
U made it worse
What is the song that they are playing
There are millions of free pianos put there. I've been offered hundreds in my lifetime.
Old timey sound loved it
Make a one of a kind song with all modified instruments. I want a pipe in my sax, or some what
They gotta take turns on who's sober cabbing and who's playing! The town hates them!
WHO JUST GIVE AWAY A PIANO FOR FREE!!!!!!
It’s a burtifull pice of machinery let it be

Sounds bad
That sounds spectacular
Why the fuck would you idiots ruin a perfectly good piano
Oh you can just tighten the strings
That’s so cool. I love the way it sounds. More people should make music like this  You can do the same thing with guitars or any other string instruments
*after an hour of screwing the piano*
o
These shorts are so entertaining it makes everyone’s day better! Who agrees? 💗 nvxwjr
Man that's amazing

Horrible thing to do to a vintage piano
We need more videos with the piano
Anything but cool sound! RIP noice piano
That sounds horrible
There’s a reason it never left the back of the truck it went right to the dump after 😂 this hurts to watch
Piano reeves
This sounds familiar
Yet another waste of time
This was hella tuff
What is the song they played at the end?
😎
Sounds great
It sounds as expected 10 times shittier than was ever intended to sound
just because it's free you don't have to treat it as trash just for a couple of likes  shameful
Why is nobody talking about how hr drew a pp on the piano (
Sounds like a shitty untuned piano
So sounds like shit
It now sounds like a better saloon piano
Cocks have to be drawn in dust! Law!
Eh
The blond bloke in the hat looks like bubbles brother
Wait they never took it out the truck
If I had a piano like this... I would definitely make it gaga themed 😻
Crazy guys!  They couldn't even wait to unload it to work on it!  They are right, it DOES sound cooler 😎.   How they figured that out I don't know1
As someone who doesnt play piano but loves the sound of them, i actually prefer the sound of this than an (what i think from the comments her) actual prepared piano. This sounds more whimsical and fun.
Awesome
Penano
Man it must be nice to have friends
What was he drawing on the dust on the piano when they got it outside of the bar?
🗑️
or you could use a DAW instead of ruining a piano.
Is that Logan Paul?
throw it into a lake and get it out after 3 years its gonna sound just as shitty
the bar was giving away a free piano
by Free they meant, donating to someone who could not afford it
Can't believe logan paul can play the piano.
Hmm sounds like crap lol
"After an hour of screwing the piano..."   They nailed that joke
Whenever you get anything for free.. you never value it
What is Paul Logan Doing there
That sounds horrible
Nice ranger bro
? Ok
They know what they are doing 😲
Banjo piano filled with screws and nails, held up with duct tape
Kinda sounds like an old western saloon
Paul brother is 1 of your friends? Lol
Sounds like it’s sick… with Covid
That’s obviously so cool you guys are very talented thank you
it sounds like shit lol
drawing a dick on a dusty surface is an automatic must do
Okay, doing bullshit is trending
Great waste of time :/

I legit forgot that sick means more than just ill.
He looks like Logan Paul, the guy in the white T-shirt
Ah yes, John Cage
It sounded better before you fucked it up 🤷🏻‍♂️💯
You can achieve all that racket without assaulting a piano. I hope you get assaulted the same way. Nails and all.
That's just like a piano at a saloon
She don’t like the long skinny ones like the short fat ones got me dying
Idk how y’all had the restraint but if this were me I’d be sitting in the back with the piano blasting A Thousand Miles 💀 it’s unsafe, I know, but it’d be so worth it
Actually sounds pretty cool
You guys are a ton of fun! Love this
All that work to make it sound pure shite 😖 I'm really scared for our future, I really am
You screwed that piano up
The dumbest thing I have seen in 2022 !
This was pointless 😒
They destroyed a piano with a hammer on the first images of the video. Makes me 🤮
That is garbage
Try putting a coin in the strings. Wind it between the three strings.
That honestly sounds terrible
Cool
Is noone going to talk about how he drew that on the dust
Me: hey that’s pretty good  Him: “when we were done screwing the piano” Me: 😳
palm muted paino
Piano 🤨 nah 🙄 guitar 😎
Lone Gunmen
I can't believe the noice coming out after you all took turns screwing the piano
Did you just say "Free"? Man I cant find piano here cheaper than 5K. And is electrical
What a stupid video.
missed opportunity to play a thousand miles
I love the O O   | |   U
*_After an hour of screwing the piano…_*
Why did the end sound like Thomas the train
Credit to John Cage for inventing the prepared piano
Blonds guy looks like Richard Langly-haha!
I wish I had friends to do this kind of stuff

It sounds cool lmao
Sounds like shit
This has got to be the dumbest thing ever!!!!!
Sounds like shit

Free piano. Let’s destroy it!
This is so sad
Call it screwed up music
Cool
🤨 my moms piano sounds like that and aside from like dusts there is nothing else in there. Y’all couldn’t just wait a few more years? Lol
You guys got way too much time on your hands
Sounds horrible
Just sounds out of tune now
God is Good Jesus is Lord 🙏🏽❤️✝️👑
dude, sounds like my 1903 piano I got for free.
The song at the end?
This just seems like a good day with your bois
It’s in better tune than mine.
🔥
it doesn't sound that bad
That’s an awful thing to do to such a magnificent instrument.
“It’s kinda beat up and gross, but we decided we take it” Bruh it’s literally free
Okay?
Why does it sound better
You just  hurt the pianist heart😩
I want a piano sa bad…
sounds like shit
Get well soon piano
The dude with glasses . Is a wish version  of logan Paul .
It just sounds like a piano with a bunch of nails in it......
You should bring it to a bar and play saloon music
Get something for free, but make sure to ruin the building and laugh about it.
Fuck to, the yeah!!!!
“Prepared” is Latin for… “Sounds like s**t”
Sounds like fair music 🤯
“Its beaten and gross, but we decided to take it” bro its a free piano wtf is wrong with you, noob
after an hour of screwing the piano lollol
What's the song that you played at the end with your friend I remember that but I have mild dementia and can't remember where it's from
There's something wrong with the weed.
My man really got off brand Logan Paul
It sounds bad, but In am actually cool way
"Screwing the piano" :skull:
Ughh. The experimental ambitions are neat but wtf leave that piano alone be fucking careful with it omg I've been trying to get a piano like that for years.
Hey man *you kinda nailed it*
Until a wire snaps and takes a finger or two.
How can they ALL play piano so well??
Set It on fire mutch faster 👌👌👌😜😜😜
it definitely sounded before they modified it lol
"There's nothin like a couple nuts in your mouth"  -The Bentist 2022
So freaking 😎
Thats a pianE not piano (Simpson)
It has this unique feel to it… I love and hate it. Eat candy and eat vomit.
This is a perfect horror song.
For someone like me not having the privilege owning a piano again, after mine got taken away from me (long story), and I've been a classical pianist, this aggravates me in every aspect of hell.
Sounds crap
Congrats you turn a piano into a guitar
It's tuned to alwaysplay jazz
Not sure If that sounded cool or not
When you load up minecraft the intro music 😄🤣😂
Did that sound good?
I absolutely love how it sounds like
Careful messing with piano strings; the thicker gauge strings are under a ton of tension, literally.
That piano sounds drunk and dazed.
The one with hat looks like logan Paul 🤣
Sounds like shit
Logan Paul wtf
you better buy a keyboard
Congrats, you’ve made a John Cage piano.
I love it
Ain’t no way that ranger is carrying that piano
This piano needs medicine
That sound really cool man that is awesome piano playing
So just destroyed a piani
You missed an opportunity to play Vanessa Carlton while driving down the road.
You people are quite obnoxious.
That is insane
to all people saying “they are lucky for finding a free piano, they shouldn’t have destroyed it” these pianos are literally a dime a dozen. churches give these things away all the time. on my fb marketplace i see 3 for giveaway right now.  im a little disappointed that they didnt do any research on what a prepared piano actually is, though. like surely this could have been done right if you googled for 5 secs 😭
What was the song at the end?
That’s impressive
I was so ready to dump on this video… but… naw… that was cool.
Made it sound terrible, I don't get why you would do that
The notes are very dull. Interesting
Hell yea fire bro.
This is a one piece song I think I can’t remember tho
its not a mistake",✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
https://youtu.be/a6_ygdKJ4_E
Why not just throw it out of the back of the truck for likes? It would sound exactly the same.
Am I the only one who thinks the finished product sounds like shit?
It’s not a mistake it’s a ✨MASTERPIECE ✨ Ayo 😳 It’s okeh to not be okeh ❤️( titan cry 😭)  TOO EASY  ❌it’s not a joke it’s a hazard✅
“So I lured them into my truck” ummm ( idk if he said loaded btw)
When he started jamming out once the piano was outside ☠️..sick ass foos!!!!
Next time do a before and after so you can show the difference
Logan Paul 💀
It's not a mistake✨ IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
he put pepe
The fact that they just left the piano strapped on the back of the truck while screwing with it was hilarious 😂 🤣
Me and my friends destroyed a musical instrument
Sounds like shit
Play Megalovania
You can refer yourself piano and make it look really beautiful and pain probably artwork white with golden artwork will make make it stand out
Fun fact: piano is just guitar with keys
Man we learned this in class last semester
Imagin all of the keyboard companies saving this audio for their new keyboard mode
Play at hells gate RIGHT FUCKING NOW
If the sting snapped…ouch those things have so much tension
Ayo😳

Not bad
Fosters home for imaginary friends type beat
Yup…sounds terrible.
ITS NOt A MISTAKE ItS A MASTERPIECE
Oh gawd that sounds awful lol, but its just whats expected
What is the song when he tested it for the first time
"we made a prepared piano"  whack
What kind of effect would be close to making that sound?
Where did you get a free piano the heck
Damnnn I needed a keyboard:(
Southern Logan paul lol
Dude in flannel looks like Trevor from trailer park boys
As someone who use to professionally eat turtle shells, that piano is scrumdeliumtous.
Dude with the hair reminds me of Pauly Shore. LOL
Made a prepared piano *smlashes piano with blunt object*
What's Logan Paul doing there?
Is that Mike Wheeler's house?
I feel like these guys are still in the 80's lol
Dik on piano

Whats the song you played in the end?
That cool taking a old piano and old nails  that sounds way better then before
👏👏
Aww yeah piano timmmeee
As a pianist this is pretty sacrilegious
sounds like crap!
U made IT a guitar
Why ??
HE DREW A DINGA LING
Sounds like a diary of a wimpy kid movie
As a pianist, this hurts my soul
This works really well. Try it.
I love the D drawing they draw on the piano
They really nailed the piano
Sounds amazing, I guess you can say that they NAILED IT!
Do the diarrhea of a wimpy kid theme song
They need to make a song with that piano
I love this piano 🎹🎹🎹🎹🎹
Idk what it supposed to sound like but it sounds cool

Old timy piano

It' sounded like a guitar at first
That’s awesome!! I’ve never seen that before.
That sus panos
I took that out of your video and made a song
Brett and Eddy should watch this
It's like watching the movie idiocracy, millennials are completely worthless.
Pirates of the Caribbean would sound amazing with this I feel like!
have any of you checked out aphex twin's prepared piano songs from his album drukqs? I think he put in the time to put different things on the strings other than just nails.
i know he did not play sonata 16 k545 on piano
Bar gives a way a good piano You destroy it.. Nice........
I wpuld have to pay 500 in south america for that free old piano
*everyone talking about how the piano is amazing:*  *Me just paying attention to what he drew with the dust*
Omg it sounds good-
"Logan you are my hero" 😂
YES
Bro has Logan Paul on a budget in his group
Sick
The original tune had extreme rocknroll potential
I wish I had neighbors like this
Sounds terrible
Soooo you wasted your time wasting nails and wasting a perfectly good piano?
How much is the piano
Sounds absolute shit
"after an hour of screwing the piano"  Rule 34 artists: OHHH YEAHHH!!!

Woah!!! That's so cool!!
"Beethoven wants to know your location"
“Finally we finished NAILING the Piano” AYO WTF😳
Why ?
im surprised how many people in the comments actually liked this piece of shit 😭
Sounds like something you would hear in a old western saloon.
Everyone: wow so cool piano   Me: why are you drawing a pp for piano
People should make small prices that you can put in the strings with different types of them for different sounds, it would be so much cleaner
This is actually cool. It’s sounds like a soundtrack
No you like short fat ones .. thats why you drew it..lol
I have a pianist forefather that's screaming in my depts, but hey I think it's fairly cool
remember the uhhhh fish he drew? a good drawing
What was he drawing with the dust of the piano...?
I think the bar whants it back now
so they just used nails in the western bars?
It just sounds like this 40 years old piano got 10 years older in two hours of nailing...
This is a sin
As a pianist this really makes me want to cry for the piano  Edit: this was just a sarcastic comment. Stop fighting in the comments y’all 😭😭 Also, someone said classical music is boring. I totally disagree with whosoever that was. You just have to dig deeper.  (My edit is so much bigger than my actually comment 💀💀)
Sounds like one of tho old bar ones
Wow, sounds like shit. Congratulations on the views.
What was that last piece called
That’s quite a cool sound
Why does it still low key sound good tho
"Screwing the piano" Literally 😂
Ayo
Sacrilegious
That sounds awesome
After an hour of screwing the piano 🤨🤨
You guys screwed up that piano. Lol

*breathes * MAKING MY WAY DOWN TOWN
I like how he draw a cute fish on top of the piano :3
Dude on the thumbnail looks like Tiny Tim
Wow it sounds great
I would love to have a piano
And then the piano was put in the trash never to be seen again
I loathe my generation
this is like the beginning of a horror movie -- cool video tho and the final result is really good!
John cage
That sounds really good tho!
Apparently, this is the Banjo Piano
Such a waste. watching amazing piano, in manufacturing of which went great efforts, on which some kids could have had the ability to learn music, simply ruined  just for.. nothing? Give it back where you took, at least there ppl appreciate the value
Sounds like shit to me.
Imagine the beer falls into the piano
(After an hour of screwing the piano) 🤣
Damn I just wasted almost a minute of my life on this worthless shit
Seems even better to me
What did he draw on the piano 😂😂😂😂
Oh my goodness I love it
Sounded like blink 182
What type of piano is that
What is that drawing
We put thumb tacks in the hammers. Increases the attack on the notes and actually sounds good.
Herbology
It sounds like SHlT, idk why anyone would ever want to use that.
AYO WHY YOU DRAWING A DI-
Sounds cool.
screwing a piano is such an american thing
After an hour of screwing the piano- I mean screwing with the piano...
They missed the prime opportunity to make a music video for Thousand Miles 😂
That is cool
Hey guys here's a free piano! -Ok thanks! *Proceeds to screech the floor and gang bang the door*
Pp
That sounds great

Don't think I didn't see what that guy drew with his finger on the dust
Pretty different.
They gave me a free piano so I destroyed their door
Ohhhhhhh so this is what the pianist in the bar fight scene of that one cowboy movie did to the piano
If cuphead had a 3d free roam mod this is what its background would sound like.
Why this reminded me of wippy kid
Idk but tge song sounds notsalgic like ive heard it as a child
john cage was really weird
Susy
Sounds shit
Sounds like a honky tonk piano jam with the nails and screws 😭
Noice

It kinda sounds like one of those small dollar tree kid’s pianos 💀
Is that logan paul?
Nice drawing 😂
I just Wana say this feels like you turned a guitar into a banjo
Sound like Charlie Brown💀💀
ZA WARUDO⏳
How you destroy something, that many people can't even afford and would be happy of getting it for free, after looking for since years sometimes. What a great opportunity to watch this.... "masterpiece"
“After and hour of Screwing the piano” Me:🤨📸
That sounds like a totally different instrument
Sounds like something you would hear when you walked into a saloon in the 1800's
Bro I’d love a piano for free
“After an hour of screwing the piano, this is what it sounded like.” HUH??!!!
When that nail gets a bit loose dont ask why you have a hole in your head
I saw a CSI episode where someone took a piano from a bar and it had a dead body in it. 💀
You legit pack a punched that piano
Is that logan paul?😂
I too would have drawn that atop the piano-
Very interesting Vaudeville Rugged exterior.
I mean..... it was free so you cant really complain 😂
oh how i love youtube comments compared to tiktok comments. there would be a lot more toxic people if this was tiktok
Neat
So you destroyed a piano for no reason?  🤢🤮🤢
i actually love that
I really wanna be friends with these people. Fuck.
"After an hour of screwing the piano.."  Ayo?
“After an hour of screwing the piano..”
….somethings are better left alone. Just saying…..
That hurt to look at
Is that how they made some of that rag music or whatever it’s called
Why did u fraw a ykw on it
It'd be better if we compare the before and after
Doesn't sound bad tho
This is a homie thing.
Ayo😳
It would sound cool if you played the song fallen down on that piano
"After an hour of screwing the piano"   My mind:AYOOO THAT'S SUSSS
:0 when ur a pianist... and seeing the screws and nails in the piano hurts my eyes 😭😭
Now play giornos theme
Beautiful Drawing👌
"After an hour of screwing the piano" you nailed it.  ....heh

LITERALLY  90's game music
You guys nailed it!!!
Sounds awful
After an hour "screwing" the piano. 😳
What’s the song you played at the end
How does that even work?
I thought it was gonna sound horrible but I watched till the end. I was right sounds horrible lol
Sounds edited in imo 😂
Sounds like one a cowboy bar in a movie would have.
Ayo 😳  Its not a mistake ITS A MASTERPIECE
That’s cool.
Everyone else says that it sounds terrible but I honestly think that it sounds pretty dope
Was that one blonde guy in the xfiles?
It actually sounds really cool, really unique saloon kinda sound
If pianos could get COVID-19:
Ayo 😳
Aphex twin used chains to make a prepared piano on his album Drukqs. It sounds very interesting, but not that out of tune like this one did.
Now drive it out to a clearing deep in the woods and leave it there
Okay John cage.
That's what she said
So did no one notice what he drew in the piano- nope? Just me? K ⬜
If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9 Jesus Christ is returning repent and put your faith in Jesus ask god to cover you with the precious blood is Jesus Christ!
Sounds like something in a 1850 bar
Ayo😳
That’s sick
Is that logan Paul?!?!
Republicans
XD
You'd never be able to tune that again. Lol 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹
Nice-
Whoah
“After an hour of screwing the piano-“  Enough.
Way to make it worse
“After we were done screwing the piano,”  Also “She don’t like long skinny ones, she likes short fat ones.” UHM WHAT?!… 👀
It sounds like diary of a whimpy kid kinda listen closly
-Guitar pedals- piano settings for 1800s pianists
"After an hour of screwing the piano..." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Seems like something you would hear in the background of a old cartoon
Honestly…I’ve wanted a shitty out of tune piano for ages. I would love it. And probably wouldn’t do anything to it…as long as all the keys actually rang. I’d appreciate and love her for who she was.
Pp
Sounds like the diary of a wimpy kid theme from the movies
“After an hour of screwing the piano” that’s SuS
Sounds horrible 🤣
Sick design, i like that rocket ship on the piano!
I need megalovania on this and see what it sounds like
I’m more suprised that they gave away a piano for free
I would vibe to that not gonna lie
« After an hour of screwing the piano we where close to the final product » 🤣
Like an untuned guitar.
*Sacrilegious.*
honey im home! i screwed the piano with the guys!
Sounds like one of those old pianos that would be in a western bar
“She don’t like the thin long ones she likes the thick short ones” HAHAHA
A prepared piano? I bet it is prepared. Prepared to die.
Im still tryna figure out how tf they got a piano for FREE?!?! Like what was so wrong wth that piano that it was free?! Lol
play a sea shanty on it
Its sounds like a guitar
Drawing a cock and bollocks in the dust. Magnificent. XD
No one gonna mention the song at the end Diary of the Wimpy Kid vibes there
Sounds like 1920s old records.
What you’re meant to do is get a grand piano and put the nails and screws lying in the strings. So they bounce about when you’re playing.
Did anyone see what he wrote in the dust on the piano...
The entire time I was watching this I kept seeing "this piano is sick" and it didn't process in my brain that you meant cool so my brain goes "the piano has an illness"
this is so cool!
thats sounds crazy
Very cool! Sounds like my uncles very old player piano.
Little did they know they were at the same bar, picking up the same piano that the Piano Man played
I wish I knew where I could get a free piano.
Why does the guy in the back look like Logan Paul
I’m crying as a pianist
Perfect song for the diary of a wimpy kid movie
Perfect song for the diary of a wimpy kid movie
I’ve never seen a video about screwing a piano 😂
i want it
“after an hour of screwing the piano” i’m dead lmao
"after hours of screwing the piano"  -👀wdym by that
Just sounds like an old piano
When Cage did this the strings lost almost all semblance of pitch. Also it wasn’t random, he’d painstakingly place and notate the position of each piece. Wild.
How dare you do this to a piano 😡
Why does that guy look like a Walmart Logan paul
no one gonna talk about what he drew on the piano 😳
An hour of what? What did you do to the piano?
Free piano, why?
It sounds awful lol
Wild west
That piano NAILED it!
You know, this piano would be the perfect piano to play "fallen down" on
Wasted opportunity to play a thousand miles
*piano on a pickup truck*  my head : *MAKING MY WAY DOWNTOWN*
No one gonna talk about the drawing?? 😂😂
It was the pp made out of dust for me
Is that Langley from the X Files? Tell him I'm a huge fan
Ah yes pp
I hate to be this person but.... “After an hour of screwing the piano, we were finally done.”
you know, this piano might actually fit the "Thomas the Train" intro.
I learned about this in music appreciation, pretty cool :9
This heart my soul deeply
Minecraft
blue
Feels a tad sacrilegious - not sure how LingLing would feel about this…
How did they last an hour?!   (He said the screwed for  an hour)
Love
It feels like someone with a toothpick and chaps is gonna run into the building looking for their mortal enemy and challenge them to a duel
Sounded batter before the nails 🤦🏻‍♂️
I- ❤
Wonder what he was drawing
"Damn thats a good guitar, what type of guitar is it?" *"piano"* _"😩"_
Sounds good mabye I shoud put it up my a-
“After an hour of screwing the piano”  Such a nonchalant joke
So cool💗
Why tf did you destroy it life what the fuck
Eeeeeyyy you fix it
Why is no one saying sacrilegious? I don't understand.
Imo it doesn't sound cooler. Poor thing just need to be tuned for starters.
"Wildwest music"
Nicee
"after an hour of screwing the piano"
AFTER AN HOUR OF SCREWING THE PIANO KSUSVWKDGBW
There is no way that a  bar that would just give a whole piano away for free
The fact that he drew a p*n!s on the piano from dust 💀
Sacrilegious
Dam the piano is sick I hope it feel better
They screwed a piano? Could this be one of my people?

Damn, thought I was in valentine for a second.
Sounds pretty good
Sounds like dog shit
AFTER AN HOUR OF WHAT
I’m sorry but that sounds terrible 😭🤣
That was a cute smiley face you drew in the dust. ☺️
It doesn't sound half bad but honestly ot sounds like it's like familure sound but not at the same time. Gives me Coraline vibes.
He really said when we were done screwing the piano with a straight face
"After an hour of screwing the piano" 😀
Sounds like a broken a** piano..
Does anyone give away a piano for free? Like in the video? I'm serious. I haven't played piano in months and I need one to come out of this crisis...
It sounds like a guitar

Lol after screwing the piano
Am I the only one who thinks the final product sounds good?? Lol
Hey look it's Logan paul
What’s the song they were playing at the end?
poor piano, wait until the string snaps
Hahaha it sounds way worse wtf
Let's destroy stuff to go viral, why not? This interweb thing is the worse pandemic we actually have.
Uhhh what did he just draw in that dust when they first got the piano
“After we finished screwing the piano” 🤔
As a former pianist, *this is cool as hell, but also makes me wanna break someones bones.*  (Edit: Wow this got so many likes for me just saying what i was thinking- but thanks<3) Edit again: after 5 months 10k? This is a great graduation gift!!! Thank youu

Dislike for not playing "Making My Way Downtown"
Nobody:  Absolutely nobody:  *Brian Wilson one day in the 60s:*
Please make a song on Spotify
You could have played Thousand Miles on the back of the car but no you playing
My conscience not having the guts to say it sounds the same and my integrity not wanting to lie are currently at a loss with each other
666k likes… nice

The old ass piano at my moms house sounds similar to that without all the stuff in it. Its like 130 years old and wasn't very well kept before she got it.
😂😂😂
Sounds like craps :(
Sounds terrible why destroy a piano?
Me as a cable guy noticing the ground block in the nail can 🤣
Sounds like sh*t

Sounds like shit
Good job, it sounds like shit

You ruined a perfectly fine piano.
It wasn't as dope as I expected the sound would be but I enjoyed watching how excited they were in their idea coming true. 😂
Why didn’t they play a more recognizable song? Or play the piano for longer when they were done?
Sounds like shit
Piano: They took my fucking eyes
Scuffed logan paul
Love how they were giving out a free piano while I can’t afford one like that and would be extremely grateful for one
Were they nine inch nails?
Sound cooler?
What was that song at the end they were messing around with. Sounds oddly famaliar.
Where tf do you find a free piano at that thing worth hundreds at least??

The dude wearing the Please Please Me shirt… you’re one of my people. Hello :)
*new animal crossing music has been made*

Will you and your friends adopt me
Yo I hope to the nails out it sounded bomb in the beginner but my ears not yall ears
Famous last words of piano
Lol, it sounds like shit tho
que dañinos, lo hubieran dejado ahí para alguien que sí lo cuidaría...
Should have driven around town playing Vanessa Carlton
Poor piano, junked and then nailed
missed a trick with not having someone play “making my way downtown” (whatever the fuck the actual song is called idc lmao) while you were driving the piano home.
“After an hour of screwing the piano” 😮
You've just discovered the secret to arcade fire's sound 🤣
Is that Trevor from Trailer Park Boys

That song at the end actually sounded really good!
"After an hour of screwing the piano.."  YOU WHAT?!?
It sounds like garbage.
I like how they left it in the truck bc they are gonna take it to the dump right after
Those strings are under a lot of tension is that safe,?
Sounds perfect to play Tom Waits Piano has been drinking
It’s fine that you put nails in it as it’s still an instrument but why did you guys smash it in the first few seconds of this story after you put screws in it?
So you ruined a piano?
Pointless...
What a waste of fucking time.
It sounds so pure and beautiful!!
Sounds like garbage. What a waste.
Man, these pianists are really upset about a free junky piano getting screws put in it
Ragtime piano my guy. Check those keys if they are smooth that piano might be worth more than you think. However I couldn't get a good look on the video 🤣 more than likely not though if it was free
John cage's bussy is quaking
“After an hour of screwing the piano” hol up
I CANT be the only one that thinks that sounds like s#$&
Sorry my ear only heard the end result as terrible and painful. You did achieve something, though.  You've managed to once again obfuscate the meaning of the words "cool" and "sick". It sounded sick, alright. "Moose with dysentery" sick, though.
Free piano and destroys it :(
Complete waste of time
Sounds like shit
It sounds something from rdr2 ngl
Wonder if that’s where chopped and screwed came from
Nice job ruining a perfectly fine piano :D
Sounds like shit lol 😆
Another murder in John Cage’s name
Ruined a piano and wasted my time.

Morons ruined a classic American made piano
It sounds shit
Sounds like shit
I loved the sound  But the fact too that at the beginning of this we see you smashed it with a hammer 🥲🥲 makes me incredibly sad
Sounds like shit
Give it to someone who will appreciate it and treat it with the love it deserves
you guys really nailed that piano. 😂
Today my friends and I fucked up a free piano
It doesn't even sound good anymore... 😞
What is the narrator's accent? It sounds like a Brit trying and failing to do a good American accent.
Trevor is that you
I wish I could play the pianey
Just wanted to point out that pianos in the bed of a FORD FUCKIN RANGER
Sounds like shit 👍
Did you ask for the piano’s consent before you screw it?
Sometimes shittyness sounds cool
Why did that sound like a pou song 💀
So mad they didnt do a thousand miles on the truck bed
Sounded better before...
Love how they never took the ratchet straps off it!
like nails on a chalkboard, yuck
“After an hour of screwing the piano”... Somethings wrong, I can feel it
that’s so cool
It sounds like shit. Sorry guys.
What kind of place just gives away a perfectly good piano???
I’m pretty sure a prepared piano is not just putting a nail on each note
I bet the owner is very happy about you scratching the shit out of his door
Its so good wtf??? I mean it sounded amazing before but still...you made it sound good, but in a diffrent way
Sounds like it’s from the 1920’s
great it sounds like shit
It actually doesnt sound too bad. Like yeah, its waay out of tune, but it doesnt sound horrible at all
That sounds horrible???
It...sounds horrid
Sounds horrible
I just got outta class, and we talked about John Cage. Anyone who hasn’t heard of him listen to his stuff
Where the hell can I find a bar that gives away a piano?!
the drukqs piano!
What song was being played while he was drawing the peepee on the piano? It sounded cool and I wanna hear it again
"Woah this piano's out of tune... I love out of tune pianos"
You know they do make keyboards and synthesizers with all kinds of effects on them now!
Bro thats pure art

Sounds like a Cembalo again
Last tune?
Fuck. Am I the only one who likes how it sounds lol

This piano is sick 😷  PREPARE THE SCREWS
Boys are just Vibing in Vaudeville/ jazz

Wow a free piano🤠, imagine you actually got it for free
Type of people you dont want to hang out with
“after an hour of screwing the piano” bruh what
Not worth all that
Woaaaaahhh🥺😭😭
Awesome.
Sounds like shit
Sounds like the AVGN theme at the end
Was just about to mention the un-mistakable rocket drawing
“After an hour of screwing the piano, we were almost done”
Good job.  Sounds like Shit.  😁👍🏼
It sounds like a harpsichord
Should got it tuned first
Sounds like a broken piano. 🤨
Sounds like shit

So you just ruined it then. Ok.
Anyone still curious why cancer hasnt been cured?😅
I love the vibe of this whole video😭😂
I like how they left it in the truck so after the video they can just go dump it on the side of the road which you know they did
Sounds like shit, why would anyone do that to a piano?
Sounds like foster's home
What’s the song at the end?
Her: he’s probably cheating on me rn Me and the boys:

Honestly it sounds like how I imagine a genuine old ass western saloon would sound like.
My son :" This is what Schroeder from Charlie Brown plays"
i would expect nothing more from a ford driver. thank you for continuing the status quo :)
Sounds like shit
It sounds like absolute s*it
So this is how sitcoms are made lol
Brian Wilson did that for Pet Sounds. Shown in the movie Love and Mercy
You guys should be banned from making content
Man If that piano could talk.
Sounds like a fucked up piano. Y'all are messed up, should have delivered it to a community center or something instead of getting drunk and hammering nails into it.
“Hey guys, we’re gonna make make this shitty piano sound- e v e n  m o r e  s h i t t i e r
Yay!!! It sounds like sh!t. Congratulations. Good job 👍
The better story is that y’all even know how to play a piano nice
Dope!
Sounds awful
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_piano
People in the south are so strange
Horrid
Sick lol
“After an hour of screwing the piano”
thats a ford ranger ol son
Imagine having 3 best friends that all know how to play piano and having fun with that
“ she don’t like the long, skinny ones. She likes the short and fat ones.”
So you're telling me people give away whole ass pianos for free in the US? Just cause they are old? People still saying us is shit
i love it
Sounds like shit..awesome job guys!
Just push thumbtacks into the hammers, dopies. That’s how you get the ragtime sound
Ohh john cage is rolling in his modified grave !
Sounds like shit
How did this guy learn piano???? Wow anything is possible.
Sounds like liquid sound shit mate
All that to make an out of tune piano?!🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Yo it's the Taz amnesty theme
Modified...oh not ruined...🤔righteyo then ...Jeez that sounds terrible
People that think this sounds good must have been "prepared" also.
Blonde dude looks like the dollar tree logan paul
Also known as a strung piano, these feature prominently in the Qphex Twin album Drukqs and the Kelly Moran album Ultraviolet!
giving me tom waits vibes
What song was that?
Now you can keep it on the pickup and drive around at night playing slow tunes making people think they’re in the purge.
It sounds awful lol
That’s where Trevor went from trailer park boys!! He’s right there in the flannel!
Is that homeless Logan Paul 😂😂
Kinda ruined it but made something new but still it’s like the bag pipes gonna take me a while to get into it
Sounds like fucking shit
That actually sounds pretty horrible
I like it... lol.
That’s fucking stupid
El stupido
Not me actually thinking it could sound good
I used to play drums and I play piano, and this sounds pretty good. I like the unique sound it makes
Why.....
Real human beings at their finest.✨💚💫
Fun idea
Wow
Was so old and in a bar so they beat the shit out of it screws just tightened them and tuned it a bit
Congratulations. You fucked up a perfectly good piano.
Missed opportunity to play “making my way down town”
The piano equivalent to a banjo
Sounds like shit! This looks fun as hell though
It sounds like shit. 😂
I thought is was going to make it sound like some weird electronic shit. Like techno or dub step sounds
Sounds so much worse
Glad Logan Paul switched from boxing to being a pianist
Prepared or out of tune?
Sounds like shit.
It may have been "beat up and gross" but atleast it sounded alright before you destroyed. You really think that out of tune crappy sound is good?!
No
Man just destroyed a perfectly good piano
bass piano
That sounds like shit 😂
When you order Logan Paul on wish
Get a job
"After an hour of screwing screwing piano. . ." 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
I wanted it to sound cool, but it just don't and I don't know how to live after that
this feels painfully american lol
Can't tell the deference
That turned out pretty all right, pleasantly surprised.
I wish I could find a free piano
☹ idky but this makes me sad
Dripsody by John Cage is one of my favorites!!!
I wish someone gave me a piano :'')
I should get friends. Seems like it's fun
song at the end?
Wow it sounds like a piano, but worse!! Who would’ve guessed
This is kinda sad to be honest. A piano like this costs 7 times what I get on a month in my job where I live
Why?
Contrary to lots of comments, I actually like how it sounds.
So a honky-tonk
Gotta torture the old piano!🤣
Definitely earned a sub
When he tried to twist the cap off the corona... 💀
You kill my soul
This sounds like some creepy music that’s someone is playing as they torture someone
This sucks
Sounded better before but man what an adventure among friends. Loved it.
"Free piano"
Sounds like a cool intro to a game 🔥
Sooo, extra effort to sound worse.
There is a certain YouTube that does funny things to pianos like putting actual hammers in it and replacing the strings with guitar strings
Should put it in a saloon
Sounds like and old time jook joint
Wow.  You took an untuned Piano and after a hard hour of solid effort, you made it sound way worse.
*Yay you took garbage and made garbage.*  You took garbage and made it worse
Lmao all the music elitists getting mad in the comments and I'm just here vibing to the funky tunes
What in the world is wrong with you dude
actually sounded cool
Meh
Plot twist: the bartender put the free sign on the piano to signify it being 'free to play', and had no idea you guys were going to steal the piano
Is that Logan Paul on the Piano
"We took a perfectly good piano and made it sound like ass"
hell yeah john cage!! play 4:33!!
“This what it sounds like…” shit.
It sounds like a piano
That is so cool love the sound
As a pianist, I was really gonna put all the pain and judgement aside to see how it sounds as a "final product".  Holy fuck it sounds like shit. This is painful to listen and watch morons hammer nails into a piano
So it sounds almost exactly like a normal piano awesom
Imagine thinking any sounds are  objectively bad.  Homeless without home, make a home where you lay.
Yeah? So?
So glad it was straight to the point
Is no one talking about he said after screwing the piano
Why? Just why?
What a horrendous waste of time
Sounds like sh*t 😕
Sounds like old saloon piano
I've heard of putting thumb tacks in the hammers. I knew an old guy who was literally a piano tuner.
Put some scotch tape on ping pong balls, and let them bounce on the strings. Playing cards, business cards, and paper create a nice mute. Vibrators are fun too, for drones.
Just sound detuned , nothing surprising at all
Drawing a cock on the piano is easily the most British thing I’ve seen an American do. Very proud.
Sounds like the tunes that old saloons in the west would sound like.. badass
Sounds like the piano from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends... i love that intro
Sounds horrible.
Trash
sounds like shit
This is so American, drinking light beer while modifying a piano they just picked up for free. Just awesome
I wouldn't say cooler lol
Am I the only one who thought it sounded trash?
This guys is how you make a piano sound well & truly *SHITE* 😉👍
Sounds nice actually
All u are gays
30 seconds I can't get back
This is a crime.
This piano sounds like shit.
But like why tho?
You lost the opportunity to remake A Thousand Miles’ music video 😭
You spent all that time and it actually sounds worse hahaha
So many fun things can be done with white claws and some nails
Easily one of the coolest things on YouTube
Piano is sick? Yeah sure sounds like it's got a bad cold
A lot of artists did something similar to record their music with. They would do this with Tacks. They called it a “tack piano”.
I hate this
This feels like when someone vuys an expensive painting then fucks it up
What’s the difference?
Great job ruining a piano
Dresden Dolls: Excuse me?
awww thats sooo cool
After an hour of screwing the piano
Sounds terrible
Not enough bullets
Good job in ruining that piano, guys.
Sounds sick 🤕
What’s the name of the ending song ?
This is hard to watch. And i don't play piano.
That's sounds like shit 😅
Didnt sound super but I don’t play piano idk
Gen X be like, Use a audio plugin filter instead
Or you could just try a harpsichord. Practically has the same sound...
Well, you're right, that piano is sick...
Some one could enjoy the piano but you decide to destroy it. Nice
Can we talk about how a place just gave away a fully functional piano? That's got to be worth hundreds at least as is..
This sounds like ass lmao. Still cool idea and vid 👍
Sounds like shit
So pointless and the sound is actually million time worse then the real deal 😕
Sounds like shit aka a waste of time
A fucking free piano, is this the most fucking first world moment i've ever seen?
Is that Logan Paul?
It literally sounded better before
Logan Paul really fell off for this video
I thought you were going to modify it, and then return back to the bar and play it.
Super cool!
all that work to make it sound like fosters home for imaginary friends
You guys nailed it!🥁
Look! A free  piano for someone who might need it. Let's destroy it. 😔
Sounds f’cking aweful
Why tho? Smdh.
Woah! Coooool! Who'd figure doing all that would make it sound like shit?
Anyone else has the opinion the piano sounded way better in the beginning? 😂
Wow it sounds kinda like an old broken piano with nails in it
Thats jus stupid
I honestly think it sounds like shit
They kept it in the truck like "we ain't unloading this just for a damn video"😂😂
Sounds like shit
Sounds like Jerry Lee Lewis
After an hour of screwing the piano..👀
That sounds disgusting.
Song?
We do not condone instrument abuse
What a waste of time 👍
so dope
Sounds like the AVGN theme at the end.
The beatles dude likes his rockets.
So cool 👏👏👏✌️
It sounds like shit wtf!!
Pianjo
So y’all made a Honky Tonk piano. Just get a MIDI keyboard….make the keys sound like literally anything imaginable
Sick is definitely the word for it…
Not what a prepared piano is but yeah
Sounds like shit.
Grats on making garbage.
Don't get it. What was the point?.
thats sick
You fucked it up
One of those guys looks like Logan Paul
OMG ITS BUBBLES FROM TRAILER PARK BOYS!!!!
This is sum id love to do frr
After an hour of what!? 😂😂😂😂😂
This is just good stuff. Friends, beer, insults, project. Awesome
I think of prepared piano, I think of Aphex Twin
Sounds like shit. Good job
It sounds like shit
After an hour of screwing the piano
I swear down hes logan paul 2.0
Watching you guys bang that free piano against that bars door and floor really triggers me.
Logan Paul clearly retired after his boxing match with Floyd.
They literally screwed it
“Finally we were done, and this is what it sounds like…   That’s right. Just as you’d expect, it sounds terrible.”
Nice.
You sound like Alex Ernst
Making garbage more garbage is always fun
Sounds horrible
Let's not even unload, so we can drive to the dump afterwards...
dust peenee
It sounds like a cartoon 😁
is anyone else feeling bad for the piano? it's like some sick experiment where someone surgically replaces your arms with your legs to see how you walk funny toward the end of your service
You would  have given it away to someone who wanted and used it properly but you destroyed it
Still sounds like shit
Does drawing dongs on it make it sound cooler!!?!??
Logan Paul looking out or shape after that Floyd fight I see lol
Sounds worse
Literally after screwing the Piano 🎹 ...
Instructions unclear my keyboard doesn't work anymore it has nails sticking out of it
Legend has it it is still on the bed of that truck
Somehow Gary Vee would be mad
John Cage!
It sounde dreadful
Sounds terrible tbh
What a waste....
Sounds like shit
sounds like shit, nice one
I want free piano 😭
The result is shit to be honest. The end result would probably sound better if you did’nt mess it up woth nails really
So chaotic yet satisfying
Sounds like trash now. Good job 👍 😊
Sorry but this sucks, like I see the idea but it is just worse
That sounds terrible haha
That's awesome
R.I.P Daniel Johnston
This sounds like a jalopy song
old Piano: I don't feel so good.  old Piano with nails; YEAH BABY!
I want
Ot actually sounds really cool! I love when people on YouTube just do fun and dumb stuff with friends. That's what YouTube's for. Keep it up!
Why?
id use hollow stand offs lol
More stuff like this
Sounds like shit
When the Asian lady's piano failures get drunk~
Never have I heard a more shit noise that also somehow sounds so fun and jungle partyesque
so idiots
That sounds so bad-good…. I love it
Alabama Logan Paul
Is that the blonde dude from me myself and Irene? Lol
Lol sounds like shit
Chopped and *screwed*
Neat
It reminds me of the music in fallout lol
To me it just sounds like a shitty piano lol
You need to sample this and sell it for people to use with fl studio
I love it, sounds like a Saloon piano
Is that logan pual wtf
I would never go through all that work just for that. 😂
That's cool and all but who just gives away a piano?
It sounds like 'the Piano has been Drinking'. Very fun, guys.
Sounds like you guys nailed it 👍
"cooler"
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON ME…
Sounds like shit
missed a perfect opportunity to make a "makin my way downtown" joke while the piano was on the truck lol
That's sweet
They had the perfect chance… and they blew it☹️ thousand miles☹️
Sounds shitty
Sounds worse
This is how it sounds now: way out of tune
As a student, this hurts me on in a different level
I too can destroy something and call it "preparing".
Someone slow down the audio and put 808’s on the final solo. 🔥 🤣
Dude drew a twig n berries in the dust. 😂
The blondie glasses guy looks like Logan paul
Ruined this piece of art that could of been refurbished
Really thought that was Logan Paul lol 😆🤣🤣
Destroyed a perfectly good piano
LUCKY WHAT I WANT THAT PIANO GOD DAMNIT
Sounds a lot like pianos people would play in saloons
Soooo, you ruined a piano lol
West world ?
That’s something my brother did years ago
This is so cool :D
I feel bad for the neighbors
Sounds like shit. Congratulations.
So it sounds like shit? Got it
Sounds like my ears are bleeding
I hope the piano recovers
Laugh my ass off it sounds like s*** I'm not even being a troll or a hater you wasted your time on a piano that sounded good and turn it into s***
Another thing you can do is smash it with a hammer lmao improves the sound with holes in it randomly
It's sounds lit
Fricken awesome . You guys look fun...not just dancing panseys
I'll like this video 1000 times for the skynryd at alone
...I enjoyed the effort..but I don't enjoy the end result ;)
#STOPMUSICALINSTUMENTABUSE
“She don’t like the long skinny ones, she likes the short fat ones” 💀💀
Yooo, that's Pianist Logan Paul
It sounds Ragtime now!
This is so fucked up wahh wahh wahhh
Lmao I thought that was Jake Paul 🤣
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Lol sorta sounds like my untuned upright 😂
The end product actually sounded really nice, that’s cool.
This is what happens when you legalize pot as a consumer product. Idiots.
The fact you missed the opportunity to play “Thousands Miles” while in a moving truck is upsetting
Id like to go somewhere where theyre giving away a piano and almost rip the doors off leaving with the piano
"After an hour of scwering the piano"👍
I’ll be honest. I don’t think it sounds good. That’s just my opinion. But it’s still a cool concept. And I’m sure other people love it.
These guys must be Canadian
Very cool. This is the comment I want to see. Rip John cage
Logan paul is that you?
Tale that to the middle of the woods and start playing it in the middle of the night. Hopefully you'll scare the mess out of some campers.
Shit I don’t blame y’all me and my homies would’ve done the same thing and we don’t even know how to play 😂😂 but shittt I’ll learn
Man, This is some 2002  Friendship Type Shit🤣💯💯 Aye I DlFucks With it 💚
So this is what no job looks like. I’ve always wondered
Fake
anyone else think it sounds shit?
This video made me physically cringe. I've never seen such blasphemy done in such a horrible way..
No one gonna talk about his friend is Logan Paul (looks like)
Exactly what I thought. Sounds like crap.
Reminds me of guitarists putting an inflated balloon inside their guitar so it sounds like a banjo.
Someone is giving away a piano and no one talks about it
This is what Brian Wilson did for the intro to the Pet Sounds track “You still believe in me”
Yeah no
Brian Wilson of the beach boys did this in 66 for pet sounds, but instead he used paper clips and hair pins.
You can lug a large piano around town, modify it tediously, Or you can use a free fruity loops plugin to get the same effect ☺️
Bro is it just me or does that one guy look like Logan Paul.
I feel like this would produce some really creepy music
Let’s go with the smokes Cory....
*She don’t like the long and skinny ones*   *SHE LIKES THE SHORT AND FAT ONES*
Woa
Made a piano that sounded like shit, turn into a different version of sounding like shit. I can't really hear how it made it sound much different besides flat and buzzy
sounds like shit
Nice
Bunch of guys being dudes🤙🏿
Why did you destroy it?
After an hour of screwing the piano....Really dude😂
How did you not think of "making my way downtown"
The first video i have ever disliked.... U don't treat pianos with that kind of disrespect
Is anyone gonna mention "after an hour or screwing the piano.." 😭😭
Good job ruining a perfectly good piano
your friend reminds me of freddy dredd
I thorough expected them to play thousand miles on the pick up truck
Sound like shit
"After an hour of screwing the piano"
I feel like there’s so much extra fine tuning bc of the nails
"Did it throw up, it probably just needs a ice pack" some school nurse probably
Logan paul looking different here
Its gona be real funny one ignorant people watch there hand get sliced off playing arround that much tension
“After an hour of screwing the piano”
Him drawing a dick with the dust is the most relatable thing I've seen all year
Great now my ears are bleeding
“After an hour of screwing the piano”
What was that song y’all played in the end
I will never get the seconds back that I wasted watching & commenting about this stupid fricken video 🤮
they screwed a piano
Sounds like love song for a dead man to me
Anyone know the song they were playing at the end?
You took the piano from idle hour?
What a waste of my time...
beautiful
Sounds like some of the strings werent tight enough but dope
Can I get my 45 seconds back?
Sounds like shit lol
That’s pretty neat.
Sounds like shit lol
Made it sound old fashioned nice
They remind me of my kind of people from how awkward they are lmao. I wish my friends never moved away when they did. I've been alone ever since.
Im on a 3.5 year long education as a pianomaker and ive surely learnee enough to build up serious hate against you
When you finally find a good YT short
Ok?? But literally none of you “made your way downtown” in the back of the truck with the piano when you had the chance. Not one of you! Vanessa Carlton would be very disappointed.
Holy shit it’s a fuckin Ford ranger god damn!
Why does the blonde dude look like Logan Paul
The best thing ever!
Wtf
Big 1900’s vibes from this
*plays fucked up free piano*  Me, a connoisseur:  Sounds like shit
sacreligious
Why does that guy look like logan
Sounds like shit 🥲
A pack of golems
If there's a thing I hate more than a Nazi is a prepared piano
Congrats... You made a worse piano.
I’m amazed how calm Logan stays
oh nice...it sounds like SHIT
Sounds like shit
That is heinous
You didn’t donate it did you? I swear I seen it in my local flea market
yall are dope
"She ont like the Long skinny ones, She like the short fat ones!" I'm here to state Diss Mayne know what him sayin💢😌
They didn't even untruck it cus they dumped it after lmao
sound shit
He still draws d**** on things? In 2021
You drew a pianist on the piano
I am not sold on the sound of the piano post modification.
I hate it
diary of a wimpy kid type stuff
Why on earth would they give away a free piano? And why is it that you guys specifically were the ones to get it?....sounds fishy because anyone with a brain would take it and immediately sell it faster than you guys even found out about it
Now it sounds like a shitty piano well done
Horror game pianos be like
Why is noone talking about them smashing the piano at the start?
😐
Y'all made a lo-fi piano
the fact that they had a piano in the back of the truck and yet chose not to play a thousand miles is a sin
When the audience asked for pian-ee but all you have is a pian-o.
I find it funny that after they took it home they never pulled it out of the car. They just left it there and did there thing to it while it was still strapped down haha
What a joke. This was a shitty waste of time
I don't even play piano and this hurt me
That sounds like absolute shit bro
Is this modular synthesis...?
You fucked  it 😂😂
Waste of time
Sounds horrible
Kinda just sound like shit
Freeano
Ford fucking Ranger
Y’all didn’t even tune it
Whoa.  I hate it.
Sounds like shit.
What’s the name of the song at the end?
"There's screws in this, and nails" And one brass Type-F ground block for coaxial cable.   Being a cable guy has ruined me.
This reminded me of that one time in the Fosters. If yk yk 😂
This is beauty 😍
When are we going to be granted the gift of fast forward for shorts?
And then they brought it to the woods and dumped it.
That one guy looks like the wish version of logan paul
You made a harpsichord
hooooly shit that really gives me some Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends nostalgia. anyone else??
This is cool cause I’m pretty sure ppl first started doing this back in the beginning of the 20th century. I forget what the era of music was called but I’m pretty sure it was after the Romantic era. It was a lot of experimental stuff. There was even ppl who were using sounds from daily life objects to try to make music like bottles, buckets, cups, so on and so forth. Pretty cool
Omg is that Logan Paul
Sounds like the thing of nightmares....I LOVE IT!
I love everything about this, unironically you and your friends seem so freaking cool
Wtf it sounds like crap, how do you think it's a good idea to put nails in it.  Maybe I'm just uncivilized
Im not saying its a bad sound, i just dont like it
Sounds like crap
I was gonna get that piano for my son’s birthday because he wants to learn, but it’s good to know it went to such a good cause
Bruh I want a free piano
Breh who things the piano sounds better than normal
I want to go on adventures and have fun like this with a group of friends.  This is beautiful and inspiring.  💛
Sounds like hell.
Ahh you fixed it! Nice
This is what the fellas are doing ladies 🤦🏾‍♂️
Sounds terrible
Hey guys great idea, let’s put nails in our piano so it’s wildly out of toon…wowwww, sounds sooo good🙄
He’s like we left it on the truck so we could drive it directly to the dump when we were done.
Thx it’s horrible
Sounds like shit
jynweythek.
So he took a nice piano and turned it into a garbage one??   Good work, Beethoven.
He drew a willy on it
Red dead
This could make a fire Indie album
This is rad 😁😁😁😁
“Bro, have you heard of John Cage, bro?” “You mean like Johnny Cage, bro?” “No, bro.”
Sounds trash
Sounds like shit
If Sonic Youth played the piano
Wait but it sounds terrible in the end
Ist that Logan Paul 20 years into the future?!
My bar only gives away free booze.
For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment; (2peter2:4) - Because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead. (Acts17:31) For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. (‭‭John‬ ‭3‬‬:‭16-17‬) Jesus loves you, he’s waiting for you to repent and put your faith and trust in Him :) Hope you have a good day
Soooo…. dog shit?
This is the type of BRILLIANCE this new generation should engaged in, not questioning what’s UNQUESTIONABLE 🤦🏻‍♂️
Sounds like shit
Didn’t even try to find the nodes. Smh
Why would you do this!?!
I know that bar it’s in Sheboygan
Taking a piano, free mind you, and making it sound shitty for views. Right on.
What song is that
Druqks covers album when?
I agree, it does sound sick and not in a good way
Please, never do this again.
I would like all of your comments and video
you were on a piano on the back of a truck, and didn’t play a thousand miles?????????
Sounds like a castle crashers track
Its beer 30 aclock my dudes
Logan paul
Does anyone know the song they were playing at the end?
Sick.. yes very unwell
What pianist would nail an instrument even if it's free
Bro you got the chance to do a MAKING MY WAY DOWN TOWN but you didn't!
That sounds like shit
0:12
Piano no. Sound maker.
Creepy Clown enters stage right
Soo....sounds like crap then
That’s the idle hour! My band and I played at that bar a ton of times this summer.
Horrible

Now replace the hammers with hammers
Somewhere, John Cage is smiling
That piano sounds like shit
Sounds like Pokémon Black and White
That's so sad... People like me would love that piano
Just kind of made it sound worse
Sounds like aphex twin
Fair x
Sounds sick
Interesting choice, having Chris D'Elia narrate the video
Sounds like shit
That's awesome.
"After an hour of screwing the piano" made me snort a lil too hard
Y’all lying about getting a free piano that was in that condition and that in tune lmao
Sounds like a Wild West expansion era saloon piano
I didn’t know your friends with Logan Paul 😂😂😂
White people know how to have real fun bruh lol
it really didn't sound better afterwards.🤨
I honestly didn’t care for it
It sounds like something you would hear in cup head lol
It sucks
Take a time. Build something in your life. And then destroy it. Just for fun. Lets see that
What was song you guys played at the very end?
Bro fur babies doppelganger in nz that white dude blondie
The ending song sounds like a real song but I can't remember the name
Sounds like shyt
Like 💩
Poor piano
I hate you.
Why the fuck would you just make it sound like shit it serves no purpose
Damn that's genius
This sounds like diary of a wimpy kid
Sounds like the Masha theme song on Netflix
Sounds like shit lol
Nice, now sounds and looks like garbage
Is that life in a northern town?
…So basically a harpsichord?
Dang. Y'all should have played the whole song.
Spitfire Audio should record tgis for a LABS patch
Ffs I wanna free piano
What bar is this?
What’s the last song called or is it a creation
So, it sounds like an old cow boy bar piano....
Sounds horrible, not cool at all.
If this is a new concept to you, search for music by Hauschka.
This is the piano RDJ used for Drukqs
Piano chopped and screwed
oh hell yeah, prepared piano! ive always wanted to make one of my own and experiment with the types of things to put between the hammers and stuff, but pianos are super expensive... maybe someday i'll be able to drop $500 dollars or something just to ruin one by shoving glassware and other stuff in it XD
FORD RANGER
She dont like long skinny ones she like em short n fat
I guess you could say that piano is screwed
1800s intensifies*
I guess you could say that piano is screwed
part 2🙏🙏
Man, I would love to get a free piano, even if I need to walk 2hrs for tht
So that's how the Charlie Brown theme song was made
another thing you can do is let the piano sit without being played for a couple of years
Really cool
i like it!!!
So you’ve made it sound worse
Im more impressed that they knew how to play the piano. I thought it was a lost art.
Very nice work 👏
That’s dope but can it change the sound any more dramatically? It still sounds very close to a regular piano.
Sounds so much worse to me
Sounded better before
Wow! It sounds like shit!
Guys really out here inventing noise glam
Bruh a free piano bruh
Every horror movie ever: *The music*
Yeah sickening
Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."
sounds like trash 🗑 😂
Good job guys going around and ruining pianos 👍🏻
“Sound cooler” he said
Guy in white shirt looks like a walmart version of logan paul
Dude looks exactly like Logen Paul
That's not piano that's Piani
Your friend with the blond hair looks like L.P
Another fine example of senseless destruction, a student could have learned to plsy on it
*Saloon fight breaks out*
Are you kiddingggg me, THATS A GOD DAMN FORD RANGERRRRRRRRR!!!!
So is that exactly how they used to get the old timey bar sounds? At the end that sounds a lot like an old school player piano. I know the scrollers and the hammers of an old school player give it the sound but some of the sounds from the screws and the nails are really reminiscent of a lot of old movie recordings you here
It sounds like one of those western panio
It sounds like there in q saloon bk in cowboy s era....
Sounds like ass. Congrats!
100% made a horrible sounding piano worse. Much much worse.
Man's looks like garth from Wayne's world
It's free with a ghost 🥲

But why?
What a waste of a day and a piano
Just sounds like a honky piano???
These guys are really cool.  😎
Sounds like trash
Feels like this could be a sample in a KennyBeats beats battle
Rdr saloon music🥵
Whats that song played at the end?
I can make it sound the same with a hammer and 5 minutes.
Ruins the guys door and laughs🤦‍♂️
That’s cool and all but uhhh can I hang out with you guys
Bill and Ted still having adventures in music I see
how can you not play "a thousand miles" while you're literally on a moving truck
Is the song he’s playing at the end an actual song? I love it a lot, so full of nostalgia it makes me so emotional.  Edit: Nothing yet?? Please someone I need this song :(
What's beat up and gross and you screw for an hour?
I cracked a beer open and a piano showed up.
What in the Kentucky fried crack rock
All that work and it sounds like shit...😂
Send it to Brasil, help some kids learn how to play.. Better than destroying instruments…
how to make a decent sounding piano sound like shit. nailed it
I can hear them play all day
That looked like Whitey from Me, Myself, and Irene!
Her cheeks evolving every blink i guess
It is not sound like the music i wanna hear.
What in the Logan hill billy Paul
A….f-free piano?🥺🥺🥺🥺 I would be happy for the rest of my life
My name’s Jeff
I like how you've put a unique sound to this 😊👍
Homie really didn’t even take the time to unload it😂

That's really cool
Sounds like shit
"After an hour of screwing the piano" That's a disturbing image, and I love it
It’s weird but cool
Piano sounded like shit. You wrecked it.
Kind of a sad fate for the piano
Banjo.
Sounds like shit
Nooooooo
Anyone knows what that last song is?
Teenage boys worldwide. Drawing dongs in dust since ever.

Screwing the piano

Is that whitey from me myself and Irene or am I trippin? 🤔😂
Sounds like a piano big whoop
Lame to smash the door of the bar.
Nice
Absolute barbarians. . . Why?! Just why!
Panis.
Take an instrument in ok shape and make it sound like total ass. Good idea..
I love how they didn't bother taking it out of the truck.
Please make a full version of the song at the end or if it already exists please tell me the name
After all that work they created an acoustic keyboard. Lol
imagine giving someone a free piano and they just bang it on your door when they’re moving  it like they don’t give a shit, ingrates
Messing with high tension strings is like playing with a bomb. Ignorance is a bliss.
Actually sounds like a old wild west  era piano.
After screwing with the strings... You made it sound from shitty, to shitty
Haha the piano sounds like shit when you do that. Completely pointless. Haha
🔥🇨🇦👊🏿
Grr rrrrrr ....
Time… wasted 😂
You cruel humans...
No way that's free
i n t e r e s t i n g
Logan Paul  is that you
After screwing the piano for 1hour      This was on purpose
"Honey get my shotgun it's that damn deer again"
Or buy a Korg!
I don’t think I would ever do this to my piano😂😂
Not bad for a bunch of nails and rubbers.
Sounds like the piano background music in the first diary of a wimpy kid movie
It sounds sick alright...
So when was fox molder gonna stop by?
I can see why they dont do this
Say you're a 20-something year old Pisces guy without saying you're a 20-something year old Pisces guy
...Or you could just tune it
0:48 y'all make that song up or is it a known song? It sounds like it would be played at a western saloon like on RDR 2 🤠🤠

Bartender- “Hey Gleer play the piano” Glar- “I quit!, and btw it’s Glar!” 😂
Sounds not good
This is worthy stuff
😎👌
I think you ruined it.
It's Horrible 🤣🤣 w.t.f?!?!
I'm sorry 😞 but I was really expecting a really cool sound but I didn't just sound like an old saloon piano 🎹 from the old west 3 for effort 🤔
Losers
it sounds awful I love it
How could you put a piano on a moving car and not play A thousand miles by vanessa carlton
What is this, Trailer Park Boys?
You missed the opportunity for a “making my way downtown walking fast faces passin I’m home bound” joke
What a waste of a piano….but there are worse things they could be doing….
Wow
They screwed the piano 🎹 🤣     FOR AN HOUR!!!!!! 😭💀💀
Pretty unique sound.  Pretty damn cool
sounds like a piano from a 40s movie in a pub or something
Is this supposed to be some sort of accomplishment? 😂
Sound Designers in 1920´s
Sounds like shit
Still sounds good
Sounds like a song from the 1800’s

Mum I want Logan Paul!  Mum: we have a Logan Paul at home!  The Logan Paul at home:
Cool.  Sounds like shit.

"putting things like nails in them to make it sound cooler"   I think something similar happened 2054 years ago
It seems  u got an old dusty free mic too haha
It’s so out of tune though 😭
Wow, it sounds fucking awful
F R E E
Sounds so good!
This is dogshit. Congrats on ruining a piano
Wtf is Logan Paul doing here…
Is that Logan Paul???
Fair enough and I love this

"Screwing the piano"
The finished version sounds like RDR2 to me 😂 waking up early morning to turn on RDR2 and hear this
That’s some solid boogie woogie you were playing
Gives me Undertale vibes, if I'm honest-
"After an hour of screwing the piano"  Jesus man does the piano want a break?
You Legends saving a Musical instrument. Big Up from the UK #0191
Logan Paul?
I'm not an expert but that sounds horrible
Jesus is the way to go remember to pray repent spread the gospel God bless amen

I thought it would be a rickroll ngl
Did ya bust it?!
Him:founds rare moment Me:gets same seed for 14x and not getting rare 1
That will become antique in few years
Who just gives away a working piano? Even if you don't want to sell it you keep it for aesthetics
Gass
Sound cool, lol
Sounds like it belongs in a old western movie
You've successfully turned a piano into a piany
So no one is gonna talk about what he was initially drawing on the piano
"After an hour of screwing the piano"
That made it sounds like even more of a piece of trash than it already did.
The fella I'm the white shirt looked like a off brand logan paul
Tbh I think it sounds like shit 😅😂
Like john cage
What if he got a job at bar as a pianist and gets paid?🤔
It sounds like shit
Sounds bad..

When I find a free piano, I put pennies in it!
*sees dust on piano   *proceeds to draw a beautiful 3 leaf clover.
All that, for the piano to sound like.. well a piano.
This hurts
Cool
A lot of cooler sounds to be made with penny’s
We learned about this in my John Cage unit in IB music. John Cage specified in his instructions for the piano very specifically. You cannot use any piano. You have to use a specific one. I forgot which one to use, but it's a type of grand piano.  Edit: my teacher BUILT one. He showed it to us recently and bought the sheet music.
i need friends like that
Shouldve played Westworld Sweetwater
Noone wants to talk about the symbol he draw at the dirty part on the top of piano
"after an hour of screwing the piano"
i saw the man drawing something 🤣🤣
Sdiiiiink
Ew
Me and my friends don’t know how to play instruments 😭I wish we did
Thought they were gonna play 1000 miles or something 🤣
Remember when randy first tasted an impossible burger and says "hey! This tastes like shit!" I kinda get that vibe, but hope it makes you happy!
This actually sounds good lol
Kinda sounds like the same strings that played after mikey killed the chief of police and barzini in the godfather
I’m surprised no one has mentioned that sick ass rocket ship he drew!!!
Middle C is out of tune…

This looks like something Mattias Krantz would do.
Very nice
Guitar piano
Did y'all see what he was drawing on the piano? Bad boy.
Sounds like it belongs in Charlie Brown
Max Richter lined the inside of a piano with velvet to make it sound like there was a filter in the piano. Pretty interesting.
That bar should had sold it even just for $100-400. But that's awesome that it was for FREE! Some schools need a piano.
*Sounds like a piano in a saloon in the 1800's*
You!!! What did you draw on the piano.
I would murder ten people for a free piano
Hope the paino feels better..
I don’t get what we’re they preparing for
Sounds like im back in 2006, playing GUN for the orginal Xbox, walking into the saloon then killing everyone for no reason.
Is that country logan paul?
So basically it’s how to make a piano sound old,got it
"After an hour of screwing the piano are finally done"
I have to be the one to mention the piano dong drawing
Thats not your friend that's just someone that looks like Logan Paul that you hired.
Bro I have more chances winning the lottery while getting stuck by lightning than finding someone who is willing to give their pianos for absolutely free.
Dust
Logan paul sure did change
my question is how do you find stuff like that?
Whats that song they played at the end result?
is it just me or does that guy with the blonde hair in the hat look like Logan Paul trying to wear a disguise lmao but frfr
what was the song you both were playing? was it one you both made up?
Logan Paul?!
Is that a free style@0:43??? Or a piece... For some reason it sounds familiar 🤔🤔
*draws man-organ on a piano dust*  Me: *OH SO IT'S UNIVERSAL!*
I love how they were so excited to screw around with the piano they didn't even unload it first
Like shit?
Amazing
It sounds like the music from diary from a wimpy kid
Missed the chance of playing A Thousand Miles while moving the piano
Jersey 💯💯

Literally the Minecraft soundtrack piano
That is the truck I want, I was supposed to look at a 2011 ranger today but it sold before I got there
REPENT AND TRUST IN JESUS. your sins will take you to hell, but if u forsake them and follow Jesus, you will be saved! He’s the ONLY way to heaven!🤍
"After an hour of screwing the piano" context people. Its very important
Oh  wow, its sounds like a broken piano
Honestly that piano sounds like something in an old wild west film
That piano still sounds off regardless of what they do to it.
I hit sheet metal withith hammers and I swear  half that sound is coming out the reverb in that checy bed.
Is anyone else as surprised as I am that any of these dudes even knows what a piano is?

As a piano player, I want to cry

Sounds like the diary of the wimpy kid opening song

Bring out your cousin’s and the moon shine
"Hey honey, I'll give the piano away for free so someone can enjoy it." "Oh my, such a great idea honey, we can make some kid happy"
I've never heard of that before. That sounded really cool.  Very interesting!!
Um what did he draw on the piano with the dust....
It sounds shit but not in a cool or fun way.
Sounds way stupider
Ben Folds put tacks on the end of the hammers, sounds pretty good
*my friends and I

"Screwing around with the piano" haha I gotchu
I love how they accomplished the task without even unstrapping the piano 😂
Aphex Twin?
yoooo that’s so cool
I wanna do this I hope it’s not just me that thinks this sounds good
Yea you got that piano from the Idle hour, my family used to own that bar.
Kinda sacrilegious, but I like it
Different doesn’t always mean good
'After an hour of screwing the piano'
"aren't you glad we fucked up this perfectly good piano?"
As a pianist this hurt! I physically cringed!
Use Low Cut To Reduce Noise.       And A High Cut        And A Mid Cut
Wish I had friends like this..
Oh God, now it's out of tune and sounds broken lol
So you just make it worse? Meh
Sounds like shit
So umm i wasnt watching but listening and u heard " when we where done SCREWING the piano" im dirty minded😅🤣

Ha! The pun of screwing with the piano
So they ruin pianos
Sounds terrible
I’ve never heard of this but it seems cool. I would never do this to my piano though
You screwed the piano for a whole hour?😦
Please don't put ur beer on the piano!!!!!!
POV: the icecream truck pulls up at your street and your mom lets you gives you 2$ to get icecream  Then the music turns on and they leave
Sounds gross
Ahhhh, the old irresistible urge to draw a weiner in some dust
ruined it
Beers and piano time with the fellas that's like the coolest fucking thing ever
Nerds are fun
“after an hour of screwing the piano.” can be taken in different ways
Sounds like the ice cream truck
Kinda sounds worse
You don't fuck with piano, piano is an music classic instrument, thumbs down! Sorry GUYS, it doesn't matter if you joke around or not don't do that I DON'T CARE
Watch somebody take this idea.
A piano with a free sign on it, what a rare scene it’s
This sounds absolutely horrible
It actually doesn’t sound bad 😰
It sounds like those old piano vids and really good
Would you look at that it didn't sound that bad
Sounds terrible
Well that didn't need to be a video 🥱
No!! Just now
Should've played "A thousand miles", it could be just ideal
I applaud the process but I cannot listen to that piano, perfect pitch is a curse sometimes...
"After an hour of screwing the piano" Their mum: SON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?
Ah yes... sounds like shit, who would've thought!
Sounds like shit
Sounds like the piano you would hear on Annabelle or something
Makes it sound more like a guitar
Wannabes ruin piano for clout.
It sounds like an old Western saloon piano
Logan Poll
Haha bro are you Marine? The reason I ask is because Marines draw penises on everything. Lol I laughed pretty on this one.
What's Logan Paul doing out there?
Eh
I thought it sounded awful🤷🏼‍♂️
"After an hour of screwing the piano"  Ayo?
"Prepared piano" *John Cage Intensifies*
Sounds like Tom Waits

Sounds terrible.

It's like a piano with a fuzz pedal, very cool
Garbage in garbage out

After an hour of doing WHAT to the piano????
"Make it sound cooler"  Sounds like shit
It’s so good
Probably the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen on this app and that is saying a lot
What a pile of pish
If you nail someone on their feet, the way they walk also will be very unique.
Your homie is a wish Logan Paul
Sounds like shit.
Prepared piano does not sound cooler 😭
This idea sucks like nothing I have ever drunk through a straw.
I’m guessing the screws added some tension on the old worn out strings and improved sound.
What song did you play?
I didn't know you are friends with Logan Paul
It sounded like Thomas the train
It sounds very old timey
It sounds like 17th century saloon
Cool
FORD FUCKING RANGER!!
Hahahaha he drew pp on dust
my dumbass brain thought he said "finger nails"
Sounds like I'm playing Stardew
Honky Tonk I think
The boys never even took it out the truck lmaoo so excited to do what they invision no matter if it's correct or not lol
Logan paul lost weight
How do you just get a free grand piano
Should I ask my mom if I can screw a piano
This piano is still out of tune
True
Umm is that a ringtone, AS A SALOON TUNE???
Bruh the D
if you just sell that shit  and donate to homeless niggas
You mean, you fuuucked a piano when all you had to do was tune it with proper tools!? Millennials🤪
Sounds like those old timey pianos in rp games u hear at a bar or something
Sounds like a old western movie piano
This is an actual afternoon with the boys.
Sounds like shit
Sounds like first arcade fire album

It’s sounds like a rdr2 paino
Should've played the piano intro to "Making my way Downtown" while on the truck
Congratulations you managed to make a piano that already sounded like shit...'sound even shittier... not hating btw I just think it's fuxking hilarious 🤣 😂
Why is that actually a good sound in the end
And then the strings snap and the nails fly at you.
Man some people don’t have anything better to do
Good job, CORONAS IS THE TROPHY!
Had no idea Mac DeMarco played piano
Sounds like sh**. Congratulations! 🎉
Videos like this remind me why I should stay in school. Three grown men ruining a piano for tik Tok views. This is not even a interesting idea. Is just three grown men putting nails in a piano. That could be me if I don't do well on school. A guy who has to do things like this for tik Tok views because all I have is a Tok Tok following.   Everyone's dream nowadays is to be some kind of social media influencer. Videos like this make me wonder why? What's so great about that live? Your job is basically do videos like this without any valuable content.   Call me crazy but I rather work on an office. I really don't see what's so great about this shit.
Sounds like sh*t
I want to see a piano converted into a BBQ grill. Now that sounds tasteful
I can really just hear the wotakoi theme UGHHHH I LOVE THAT ANIME
Now it sounds like a cartoon piano
I’d take a free piano any day
Oof
I’m sure your neighbors are loving that
"after an hour or screwing the piano we were close To the final product" i get that youre screwing it but dang it sounds weird
I hope it gets better
Why did that guy look like Logan Paul 😳
My piano is crying in the corner wishing I'll never commit such act to it. 😂
As a piano player, I’ve never suffered so much in my life.
Dang...free piano?
Is anyone working anymore
Was he trying to unscrew a corona.
Doesn't sound to bad
It sounds a bit like an organ
Nice
After screwing the piano..
Thats sick as fuck good shit dudes
missed opportunity to play a thousand miles as you were driving with piano
0:11 you come to an establishment to collect a free piano and you then proceed to treat their premises like so. I would slap you up in the parking lot and teach you animals some decency.
Yay to the new indie sound
Do not let mattias krantz see this
These people are sicker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNg3Vnfu4Pk&t=1882s
Jynweythek
"after an hour of screwing piano"👀
This hurt
Bro I wish I could just stumble across a free piano
Idiots. You only put the nails in the hammers.
The bar: hey man can we have that junk back
Corona's look ice cold lemme get one 🍺
I thought yo homie was Logan paul
Yay 900th comment
reminds me of charlie brown for some reason lol
It would’ve been sick if you guys started driving the car and one of you played the piano probably could’ve gotten arrested but worth it
Sounds like the beginning of an early 2000's indie movie. Or the soundtrack to an animated Tim Burton movie. Damn I miss those.
Bro whats the song at the end, thats was hella smooth
Sounds like shit
Cool idea ngl but the piano still sucks :/
Freeeee?!?!
Thanks for making me hate you.
If you move a piano twice without tuning it sounds like a saloon piano.
Is that Logan Paul
Poor old piano!
WHY DOES YOUR FRIEND LOOKS LIKE LOGAN PAUL?
Shoulda played the snoopy piano song
Don't poke smot kids.
Fucking awesome!!💪👊🍻
Lol nah, sounds bad.
*John Cage has entered the chat*
daniel Johnston type beat
Lame
Whats the song at the end?
Sounds awful
Nice
tf people are just giving away whole pianos for FREE?
That for some reason sounds like the music that would go on during those old cartoons where the words were read and put just a bit after the scene happened
Sounds like the piano I have at home.
This was so dope, but the coolest part about this video is that they actually know how to play
Bro reminds me of bubbles from tpb. Once you see it you see it lol all of this is tpb minus jail lmfao
Sounds pretty bad
Lame
That's cool.
*c a t  p i a n o*
Never left the truck, love it
Sounds like ragtime pianos
You know damn well they drew in the dust FIRST then did a lil test run and just edited it. They're human, after all.
That would only ruin it
The sounds at the end reminded me of my child hood because there always used to be a menu song that sounded just like that so cooleo to u guys
why is a bar just giving away a piano for FREE!?!
Where can I get a free piano?
Am I the only one who thinks this sounds like a piano that got screwed up
Sounds worse
FREE PIANO??? WOAH
The idea of a prepared piano was actually invented by American composer John Cage! He was the guy who wrote 4’33 (a completely silent piece) and was a pretty revolutionary contemporary artist. His life was pretty interesting and I recommend looking him up! I did a history project on him last year so I was excited to see this show up in my feed
"I lured them in my car"
Kinda just sounds like the little kid piano my grandma once had at her house. It just had 1 really high twangy pitched octave basically
N it's sounds trash 🤣
You didn't even unstrap it lol
Cool
What is Logan Paul doing in this
I liked this before he started playing because of the beautiful drawing he did on the dust
Nice
https://youtu.be/DdmNYNkcwKE ,,,
He drew on the piano
There are so many people that could have put this to better use
Ew poor
Savages
Is that Logan Paul
It sounds like a honky tonk piano now
It just sounds off, not bad or good, just incorrect idk
Corona aint twist top..i remember when i had my first beer
Another fun thing u can do is put tacks on the hammers, that produces the “old west” saloon sound.
YOU monsters take it to a professional or at least tell others to go to professionals if you are because some dumb kid might actually do this to a thousand something dollar piano
Amazing vid
And here I can't decide what I'm going to do today
I love the rustic yet beautiful sound of the piano. It reflects these guys’ friendship. Crusty, but full of love and “let’s see what happens” energy.
Me not knowing the difference 😃
That’s very cool
“Screwing the piano”🤣
Jesus loves you guys so much❤️Jesus is coming back very soon. PLEASE put your faith and trust in Jesus and His finished work on the cross,make Him Lord of your life and be saved. You never know when it will be your day......
Sounds just like a broken piano hahaha
Yeh there is a swedish guy who haves an entire channel about mixing pianos with shit
Why didn't they unload the piano first
Sounds like something from a saloon in the 1800’s
i cant be the only person who thought that was logan paul .
Just sounds like a shitty piano
Sounds worse imo cool idea but prefer the og sound.
Sounds better before
A bunch of drunk dudes would know joe to play piano. Everybody good at something
Way to ruin a piano.
"After an hour of screwing the piano we were getting close to the finished product"  Me and my "special mind": Andioop
HOW DID YOU MAKE THAT AMAZING SOUND (I really love ur vids I wish I could make my violin sound as good as this piano does keep up the good work)
Prepared Pianos suck, it's a waste of a great instrument.
Is that Logan Paul?
I want an extended version of the song at the end
Sounds like shit
Not one of ur friends drawing a d-
Thid kind of hurt to watch
Logan Paul went from pokemon cards to pianos respect the grind

OMG this is a Masterpiece has his own harmony!! But "after an hour of screwing the piano" sounds so dirty..... LoL
This physically hurts to watch
You had the chance to play a thousand miles while asking your way downtown. Just sayin' 😂
Kinda sounds like a harpsichord
What's that ending song?
I like that they didn’t even take it off the truck 🛻 😂
I dont care about this video
tArUmlÜg   Programmierer der Master   K. I.
Me and my friends made an okay sounding piano sound like shit
sounds like shit
To be honest you could have played so many songs before the screws idk why you wanted the screws but hey it’s you I’d be playing ill vento doro everyday
I'm so very happy to see that beer was involved in this process at some level.
THEY DREW A PP ON THE PIANO LMAO
What were the songs you guys played in the video?
Sounds sick
Piano:killl meee
I don't get it. It doesn't sound cooler to me.
I just wish you guys were strong enough to actual move it out of the bar instead of dragging it out.
"She dont like the long skinny ones, she like the short fat ones" "After we finished screwing the piano"
I can’t believe this wasn’t a Rick Roll, I spent the entire video stealing myself for the humiliation
Maybe should've played a before and after tune lol doesn't sound too good tbh
I thought the white haired guy was Logan Paul
Put guitar strings in the piano
Neighbors just waiting for 8pm so they can call the cops and make a noise complaint.
After an hour of WHAT!?!?
If Hipster was a visual description - this would be it
Free piano!  Coffee tin of nails!  If this video makes one dollar he wins!

Anyone know that last song they were playing?
That is so stupid
Sounds like shit
The end sounded like shit ima be honest
After we screwed the piano  Lol that comment got me hard 😂
*"After an hour of screwing the piano"*
Go check out John Cage’s prelude and interludes! It has gamelan sounds and they are achieved by different combinations of nails, nuts, rubber plastics and bolts.
As a classically trained pianist, who owns a beloved Yamaha studio piano, one of the last "Florentine" designs and walnut stain .... I could never condone all this horrible ABUSE!   Thumbs DOWN! 🤬🤬
I want a free piano.... even if it's not in the best condition..
This piano is sick..........Is that good sick or bad sick colonel.
This sounds really old timey lmao
should've played a thousand miles on the truck while it's moving lmao
Joe Dirt Logan Paul
Thus is so bad wtf
Sounds kinda like a harpsichord.

Original pianos sound better

I can hear the piano screaming in pane and I am screaming with it
I will now be on the lookout for a piano
Oh no. We’re you guys really hitting that piano with a hammer..come on
"After an hour of screwing the piano" they know what they did there
No one's talking what he drawed
It sounds like shit tho
that dust drawing is sick ☠️
Is that whitey from me myself and Irene
#Noice 👌👌👌👌😉👽👽
I too like to ruin things and call it "art".
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
This is a sin
What song are they playing at the very end
Sounds worst
You’re telling me that’s NOT Logan Paul
POV:your watching the peanuts and this is what you hear

Damn... wish i had friends.

Imagine taking a free piano and destroying it for fun rather than let someone who's interested in learning see and find it
V.I.B.E.S
Perfecto 💋
how was this cooler?? it just sound like a fucked up piano lmaoo
Is that Ben Rayborn the skateboarder?
Sounds awful
Giving Pianos a new lease on life
I hope the piano starts feeling better
The blonde dude looks like he belongs on Wayne’s World.
Imagine ruining a perfectly good piano
Sounds horrible
Poor piano
Do y'all just give out free pianos?
How american is this video xd
Why does he look like Logan Paul ( blonde one )
My ears are hurting....my heart is bleeding....and my eyes are poppinggg
When you bring the hillbilly outta classicals
Logan Paul?
He looks like Logan paul
A prepared piano is exactly that, prepared, so the things you add make planned harmonic changes. Not just throwing any old stuff anywhere, then you just have a de-tuned piano
Sounds like shit
Sounds like they look
Just a fun day with friends, no money spent
Wtf i see logan paul in the guy with cap
You just fcked up the piano
Okay, but what did you do with the first "prepared" piano before going to the bar? smh
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Why does it sound like from those old cowboy cartoons back in old times
🤣🤣😅
“after and hour of screwing the piano”
So u took a piano and made it sound bad 😂
Sound was definitely cool but seeing delicate piano strings tampered with like that makes me hurt 😩 Glad you did on an old beat up one
2 fingers of whisky all round.
GIORNOS THEME ON THAT PIANO NOW.
Who tf gives away a free piano

for some reason it sounds like it belongs  in a horror movie soundtrack
That sounds like s***
Reminds me of Charlie brown
Am I the only one that thinks it sounds like shit? 🤣
Stop telling these guys they did it wrong.  From John Cage, the (mostly) creator of prepared Piano: "When I first placed objects between piano strings, it was with a desire to possess sounds. But, as the music left my home and went from piano to piano and from pianist to pianist, it became clear that not only are two pianists essentially different from one another, but two pianos are not the same either. Instead of the possibility of repetition, we are faced in life with the unique qualities and characteristics of each occasion."
missed opportunity to play "a thousand miles", on the back of that truck
You better take that piano to the doctor or at least get it some medicine.
Reminds me of a ps2 game soundtrack
reminds me of the theme song to Flapjack
Omg the idle hour
You are supposed to use bobby pins
That is amazing I mean that’s awesome I don’t know what to say it’s amazing
“After an hour of screwing the piano”
Sounds like shit. Don't see what the point was. This was dumb
Not to bad
Can you play any Ben folds?
it kinda sounds like an older piano, i like it!
You NAILED it
Didnt know Logan Paul was your friend
You did good 👍🏼
So basically a bootleg harpsichord?
Did you guys really smash the piano?? Seems like a waste to take a free piano just to destroy it when someone else couldve gotten years out of it.
*Slaps the piano into the door *laugh like they own the place 👍
"After an hour of screwing the piano we were finally done" 💀✋🏽
That sounded like shit, honestly the original piano sounded better 🙃
"After 1 hour of screwing the piano"
Lucky bastards got a free piano
Me and my friend’s ruined a piano *
Sounds like poopies.
One of them looks like the Walmart version of Logan Paul
Yep, we'll definitely have flying cars im the 21st century
Damn imagine wanting an actual piano and these guys just casually getting a free one  Couldn't be me -_0
Why does it feel like they're doing something bad
Logan Paul's looking busted
That's not exactly what prepared piano is but I think John Cage would still be proud.
"after an hour of screwing the piano"
“After an hour of screwing the piano” Bruhhh
John cage lmao
Your friend looks like a homeless logan Paul lol
Bro a free piano like that.... thats a steal
We put thumb tacks on the back of the hammers to make a honky tonk. Loved it.
This is awesome!
it sounds like one of those old timey pianos.
pp dust
To my understanding putting nails in a piano is sort of like the frets on a guitar.
This hurts me. 🤣🤣 I'm just close to the instrument😭
Call it the “nailifier”
I love the facts they left it in the truck. I moved a piano once too. 🤣
Unpopular opinion. It sounds like someone threw nails on the strings.... Horrible
Sounds awful lol
after an hour of screwing the piano 💀
Must have covid if its that sick.
It might be short but it sure is skinny
Sounds like an old west piano
So, it's a banjo now. Fitting, noice
omg that sounds sick!
I have ear cancer now thanks
Man put a whole piano in the bed of a Ford ranger
So out of curiosity, what does this do? What is the purpose for it, and how did this come about? I'm genuinely interested to learn.
sounds a bit like a honky tonk
I love it, sounded ruined in the middle of doing it but at the end i love it
If these guys were black and doing this White people: :oh must be nice when they all have the same day off!"
Seems like a piano with extra steps
I'll rember this next time I find someone giving away a piano.
Cool
As a musician this hurts me so much
And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, Jesus said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
Not that good
run that back what was he making with the dust 🤤
Awesome!
They better have played "A Thousand Miles" while transporting that piano
Do we pay attention to the dust drawing orrrrrr
Didn’t know Logan Paul played piano
But what does she think about the long fat ones? 🤔
Sounds like dookie  Busta
They had a piano on the back of a truck and didn't play "making my way down town" ...
My guy looking like Logan Paul 🤣
Reminds me of the simpsons "i said piani not piano!"
Sounds like a piano you would hear in the background of a bar scene
so fake who would ever give a free piano bro
Awsome
What a waste of time. It sound like dog shit compaired to regular tuned piano
That is the coolest Piano Club I've ever seen
I’m more impressed they got 3 guys in a ranger

Low key left it in the truck because the next stop is the dump 😂😂
How to destroy a piano
Y'all spent a day fucking with a perfectly good piano? Shame on y'all

Romans 1:28-32 (KJV)  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

Overcomplicated guitar
Big RDR2 saloon vibes right here gents

Putting stuff on the piano strings sounds haunting.

John cage

Old Timey Saloon in a Spaghetti Western had those pianos.  .  Homer voice: *Hmmmmmm, Spaghetti Western....*
If bubbles and Logan Paul had a child
"Let's break this piano and call ourselves cool 👍"
You guys can play piano but none of you considered harmonics when playing screws
It’s crazy that they all seem to know how to play piano
Sounds like Myuu
Ew

Ok am I the only one who though of the peanut movie? No ok then
Its Beutiful :D
He just twisted off a corona top damn.
Quit screwin around with that piano   Fr that sounds like old timey piany
Well if the goal was to make the piano sound like shot than mission accomplished
Idk why the song reminds me of the diary of a wimpy movie opening
They missed the opportunity to play the peanuts theme song.
Insane
"After an hour of screwing the piano"
Blond guy looks likes Walmart brand Logan Paul

I loved the end product it sounded great!
this was hard to watch, i have a piano that looks exactly like that, it’s over 100 years old. how dare you treat such a old antique piano like that!
Oh fuck yea
Sounds like shit
Brian Wilson did stuff like this when recording Pet Sounds, namely Still Believe In Me for the piano intro. He put hairpins in the strings
"After hours of screwing the Piano, we were getting really close"
Dope
John Cage???
I think I just died watching you smack the hammer on the strings...
Why did he draw a nose on the dusty piano?
.
Bro that guy just had a good time with his friends
Siiiiiiick
Well done, you detuned a piano
Seems like it would fit right in a nice saloon in the yee haw days
At least respect it, someone had it before you...
its shit
Actually sounds good
what song were they playing at the end of the video?
I like how you left it in the back for the truck so you could take it to the dump right after
Sounds like something off of fosters home for imaginary friends
Sounds like a marimba
I don't know who any of these people are but the blonde guy really reminds me of Logan Paul lol
Feels like my ears need glasses
This thing gotta be call a screwed piano
there’s something really funny about people moving pianos imo
Didn't know Weird Al has a nephew that plays piano.
Sounds awesome
read dead piano gang
this sounds like one of those 1800s wild west saloon pianos
Very cool

Teacher:Sean what did you do over the weekend? Sean:me and my friends nailed a piano  Teacher:…excuse me!?
Cool sounds like shit
Idk why but it gives me diary of the wimpy kid vibes 0-0
What was the song he was playing once you got it
Lol you took the piano from point pleasant 🥺🥺
A FREE PIANO?!? WHERE THE HECK DO YOU LIVE IN?
Watched the whole thing thinking it would sound good in the end lol
Ahh hillbillies ruin a piano. What a great video
The most devious lick
This feels so hipster. 😑 Piano is fine how it is
The idea of a prepared piano is to put nails into it at the harmonic intervals, not wherever you want. Although it isn’t a prepared piano, it still sounds super cool.
aphex twin has entered the chat
I appreciate the effort put into this
I love music, ALL music
He drew that symbol too well....too well.
DIY earrape piano:
Sounds like an old piano with screws in it.
Sounds like shit. Cool idea but shit
That sounds… awful.
Lowkey sounded like ob-bla-di, Ob-bla-da by the Beatles
Meh tbh I like pianos when they sound normal
Reminds me of diary of a wimpy kid
Oh wow that is cool. It sounds like an untuned piano
I got a free piano if anybody wants one
Nice. Sounds like shit
that sounds fuckin terrible
This sounds like it would be at the beginning of a diary wimpy kid movie
So cool
Jesus have respect for someone else’s shit and don’t break the door
Music nerds are the best nerds
This sucks
nice
Sounds like being in our old western cowboy movie 🤠
Honest opinion, sounds like absolute SHIT.
This video is perfect. It's funny, yet still gives a chill vibe.
Behind the scenes on making the Bioshock score.
Can’t tell if my speakers were peaking or if it was the video itself
Put tacks in the hammers
Beer and nails go a long way
I don't like that they destroyed it
Why did you smash up the piano? The video begins with someone smashing the piano, why? You could have left the piano and someone that really wanted it might have taken it. I think it's heart braking to see these old pianos destroyed.
You missed the opportunity of doing the "Making my way down town" :(
This friend group makes me miss having friends
Sounds like red dead saloon music
While driving back shoulda played a thousand miles like the music videos
Jake Paul looks terrible now
Sounds like something that Jónsi of Sigur ros would make
Sounds like the piano in western movies. Buetiful
diary of a wimpy kid sound?
Amazing
🎹
Sounds like a music track from the mobile game "Idle Miner Tycoon" 👌🏻
God made us in his image so that means he was a Memer
Was that Logan Paul
Dude I thought that was Logan pual
sounds sick
You all took that piano and treated it like Sid did his toys
Horrible
Its like palm muting a piano.
“After an hour of screwing the piano” 😳
“She don’t like the long skinny ones, she likes the short fat ones”
Sounds like the forties mid fifties 😮‍💨 lucky you know how to play.. I never played an Instrument that sounded so beautiful (I love your videos! I wish I could be like u ! Thank u for your videos they make my day
That's what aphex twin did on drukqs
Maybe the real friends is the pianos we made along the way
Sounded like a banjo kinda
Can't wait for people that want to learn piano or that are pianists come complaining that they don't even have a piano and you "ruined" one. Like they really are not that hard to find I don't feel like I've seen like 7 or 9 of them for sale
Jesus loves you,,,
Very pro gamer move
that’s epic
That's awesome
Such a waste 🤦
Y'all ruined that piano 🎹🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Is this what charlie brown did? Lol
That’s so cool
