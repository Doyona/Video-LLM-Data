No square watermelons actually aren’t edible because they’re not ripe because when you put them in the mold, it will prevent the watermelon from growing fully so it will actually not be right so they’re an inedible

The ramen juice Blocker is just a thing for little girls when they are getting their hair washed they put it on so water doesn't get in their eyes
So do not move to Japan
I’ve always wanted to go there!!
In Japan they add to extra numbers it's actually 128
I have lived in Japan my whole life and I can guarantee this is true!
Wtf does Japan love watermelons!?
At 4

My brother is making sausage right now and it smells gooddddddddddd
My mom  is  rood
6:06 What would be really cool, if they added a fish food dispensary. So if you have to make multiple calls/bored while waiting for the other person to pick up, you can feed da fishies. *adorable*  I saw something similar at a golf course on a petting zoo farm. You’d pop a quarter/nickel into this feeding thing, and pulled a lever, which dispensed feeding pellets for the goats. You put the pellets into this tiny can, and like a pulley system, lifted the can over to the goats. *amazing*
I was going to Ohio but now I’m going to Japan :000000

Sniper wolf I love you so much
The Coca-Cola is cream soda

Karan Japan has evil spirits that haunt you until 20 and other ghosts that don’t care about your age and will still haunt you
I love how Japan thinks about the people that live there and they think about what they might need.

you always make my day. I love your videos but I just wanted to tell you something sorry I just wanted to comment on a random vid Im sorry if i offended you. We are on a floating ball in the middle of nowhere and we are all about to die. just asking, but even though you were a good person in school did you ever think you got in trouble because the teacher because of you and they had to give the whole class a random talk. So then you cry at home because you think you got in trouble and everything is because of u.

3:13 *Fun fact.* Clear coca cola was actually invented by a guy named Georgy Zhukov in the 1940's as a request to the *Marshal of the Soviet Union.* The clear coke looked like a bottle of colourless caramel coloured cola with a white cap with a red star in the middle. This was supposed to resemble *Vodka* Back then, Coca Cola was banned from Russia, due to the world war.

I live in Australia 🇦🇺 and all these stupid things are just a useless piece of sh*t
God loves you❤️ He will save you from sin if you choose to follow him, repent from sin, turn to god and share his word🛐💕✨
Before I moved from Korea to America I visited my friend Riki in Japan for a week, it was amazing, some things were close to Korean stuff, I liked it
This is the best video I have watched all day
She keeps me happy and not letting me go and be alone
I live in  Jaqan
Sriracha machine: everybody come here not that much money just for a bottle of sriracha comes in a cute little pocket too my stepdad: grab me that device
I meant to say I by the way
Are used to live in Japan so I can relate to all these amazing gadgets besides the very first one I don’t understand that one
these things + vocaloid concerts are the reason why i want to move to Japan.
I love your videos they are so cool I wish I could meet you one day
Bro if you just watch this with only facecam oof demonetized
2:53 is actually “ねりねりくん” (nerineri-kun) and its basicaly a quick, delicious snack you can make! you can make festival food, candy sushi, gummy like donuts, esc!

3:24 we got clear pepsi in Canada
Why Japan is my favorite country
Why would you sleep in Japanese train stations? More women get harrased there because of naps and just existing
I am lucky because I am in Japan 🇯🇵
£6 that same sauce is in my local tescos for £1.49
I JUST herd and  Lia doing her thang BUT when she was talking about the robots there was a robot that I saw and it’s name is Peppa a frickin robot that was shown at our school when I was in the forth grade that was from JAPAN 🇯🇵 CRAZY ama faint😣😐😣😐

It’s the fact that you can pour the Coca-Cola in A glass and pretend like it’s water

Yeah that might seem cool with those toilets playing music but everybody knows what you're doing in that toilet you're either pooping or peeing or both
Yeah you think those robots are cool now but within a hundred years they are going to take over the world either robots or aliens is my prediction
SSSniperWolf that umbrella is actually perfect for people who are really allergic to water there have been cases of people allergic to water even their own tears they can drink water but if it gets on their skin within a minute they've already got a burn I feel bad for those people 🥺
That is a cool way to make fruit and vegetables different shapes but what I found really cool was to get pear Brandy you put the bottle on the stem while the pear is still little and then when it's ripe pluck it pour in the Brandy and there you go 😁
Here in Taiwan there was a Mountain Dew Ice. Obviously it was clear .. 😁
The white spike is something from a movie and it's deadly
In my school my Japanese teacher turned on a video and everyone was like HEY LOOK ITS SNIPERWOLF!!!!!and my teacher was just like hu---?
Japan looks awesome 🤩
Me wtching this vid on 2 devices😂
This is the most roundabout way I have ever seen someone find an excuse to talk about MELONS.  Is that the true objective of all of this discussion about things from Japan?  Or, is it just my suspicious nature?
The white spikes: destroying and killing everyone  Lia: he didn’t do anything wrong FrEe HiM
Me in bahrain on a trip thinking i shouldve went to japan instead of bahrain
Sssniperwolf: “Wam bam mam “
ok so actually not only japan have goofy shaped watermelons, china and some other countries also have them
I thought women didn't poop 👁👁
In America when teachers say u can bring soda but it has to be clear:sprite,siaramist,gingerale,etc. Japan:Coca-Cola • Clear
I want to go so bad
Teacher I am definitely saving myself to do

I LOVE JAPAN
You know when the picture of the coke bottle came up i thought it was a ad Lol 😂
Cannot wait to migrate in Japan. :3
That ad at the beginning of the video is for the 2021 movie “The Tomorrow War”. In the movie, that animal is highly dangerous and should not be let out.
Yep I totally agree with her because yellow watermelons are so good
I love your videos they are so funny 😂🐺❤️
So my mom lives in Japan and there's actually a clear coke there and my mom said it just taste like sprite or water 😂
I am moving to Japan thanks for showing me this
Me; claustrophobic and sees train ………..
We need butter on a stick!! What's up with that
Clear Coke? It doesn’t taste as good. The Gas station down the freeway sells Japanese import snacks and drinks. The Clear Coke just isn’t as good, like not even the same flavor
First freeze packs then heat packs you can not get in america
i know its weird but i counted how many times she said japan it was 14 but we don't talk about that.

Clear cococola so the vegan teacher can't help at you

The robots really reminds me of a time at Walmart I was with my granny and I almost got hit by a dang self driveing cleaning machines and someone hit me with a cart

Why the heck are you lagging
That train got nothing on us in the uk at rush hour
Wow!
Why is the quality of these videos going down? Is it the editor or sssniperworlf? It makes it hard to watch.
Can we just take a sec to appreciate how great Sssniperwolf is? And the time she takes to make these vids for us?
You said allergic to Rain my name is Rain 😅
England has heated fried things
Sniper: free him didn't do anything  Me: well ummmm.... watch the tomorrow war.....
Why did her mouth stop wording the right words in the beginning of the video
Is it just me or the video and the sound don't sync? Bro I'm so confused rn
Don't you watch the videos over?
What the... Video and audio is not matching
You will never see me again
That trucks hologram is a preview of the movie the tomorrow war
Oh we have the watermelon bread in china here
Am I the only one missing a huge chunk of the video, voiceover jumps right to mini pancakes, but showing poop ice cream... then the rest is messed up
And this is why I’m moving to Japan.
So no one gonna talk about how the vid start acting up
Was it just a glitch but uhm when i was watching her mouth was moving and talking about something else but u can hear the other ting before that
Plot twist: the clear coke is actually sprite in a coke bottle with *clear* on it.
Are u back in your old house??
the clear coke is lemon flavored instead of the usual caramel flavoring.  sounds nasty.
Did anyone video mess up where sniperwolf was talking about japan and what they have but it wasnt showing the same thing on the video
I have a question that she speaks and the left side is slow
Nice edit girl but if you did it in real we would have liked it more
your audio is not lined up
I never knew Japan had such cool things thanks Lia I learn something new everyday from you 😍✨✨
Yall aren't about the sound it was misplace

Is that English she is shouting?
Japan= future
The first one was like so cool bc I watched the movie
dumb
I can’t get enough of hello friends it’s me
I am pretty sure the first video clip she showed with the truck and the thing in it was a whites spike you know the one in The Tomorrow War movie. Like if you agree.
wait, so there are no pancakes in American MC Donalds? In my country,we do have, but not apple sauce, its chocolate syrup and honey. BTW, I don't live in Japan
3:36 Sprite: UGH THIS B- *tap tap tap tap*
THE TITAN LOOKS LIKE A BIIIIIIIIIG BABY!!!!!!
2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
In Japan everything seems expensive like the saracha was 600 it is like it is 6 in other places
That’s not real that’s the movie a war tomorrow

Japan is pretty sick!
The first one reminds me of something off of stranger things
japan be living in a different universe
Japan is like 20 years in advanced than the US
Omgggg eeeeee
80% of video i watched just the right side .)
Is there a word for SSSniperWolf's strangely familiar accent??
I think a lot of these things, like the lip stencil and the vending machine disguise, are actually chindogu--which is basically art pieces that are supposed to be simultaneously both ingeniously inventive and hilariously impractical.
Half of that is barely even seen in Japan. Don't get your hopes high people
7:04 wow the best one🤣🤣u can be vending machine of your own wam bam yes mam🤣
Deja de gritar....petarda
1:57 “they got you covered” pun intended?
i like you so much
SSSniperwolf:hello friends Some people:I’m outta here

I hate 💩💩💩💩💩💩

Clear Coca-Cola was the one I'm most surprised about but a suggestion for your next video I think you should to introduce both of your dogs in just a little short and if you have any other pets
Yellow water Mellon is my fav fruit
Japan is a world of wonder
This is not a lie as a Japanese girl who lives in Japan, we actually have these things lol

No one:      Not even a single soul:            Me: liking my own comment

It breaks my heart I miss the states

yeah but if like millions of phones were in the sanitizing port thing the next phone to go in it will probably be dirty still
I remember when I was small, I opened the fridge door to look for cold water, and accidentally took that clear coke instead of water and that fizz I felt on my tongue was so much that I don't even drink coke now..
When I was in japan we got butter in a tube. It even had an icing opening thingo so it came out in an icing star shape😂

Hello me, not SSSniperWolf.

Wait does she actually not know about yen?
The white spike that was showed was a FeMaLe🤭
I can see why everyone want to at least visit Japan, the way do even simple things, like when eating at a restaurants and they have servers that are robots, and it seems like the places are a lot cleaner too! Sure a lot of these places may be more fancier places, like it may not be that way in poor communities or say at a fast food place!   But they obviously have a lot great reasons to visit, I've also heard that the Japanese are actually really nice too and friendly!
why did you body shame and make fun of trans people? Most of us looked up to you and loved you. Why lia, why?
dude i saw that white spike and next thing theres a hole in my wall

Sniper wolf wanted to free the white spike would have been the biggest mistake known to existence especially because it was a female
The watermelon is not 2000$ it’s looks like that because Japan’s currency is yen

Who else been watching sssniperwolf since 2015 lol (I’m Not a Bot I’m just wanna troll)
Japan has to be one of the coolest countries in the world. The technology is so advanced there, and it’s filled with genius inventions. It’s definitely a country I will love to visit. I want to try clear Coke. I really love the smartphone cleaner idea. It’s brilliant. I wish America has genius inventions like Japan.

I love how it isn’t that Japan is just more advanced then the rest of the world it’s just that they actually care for their people and don’t mind using their money for them        and they trust the citizens
Did you know bento box is redundant? Bento means lunch box, so when you say bento box you are saying, 'Lunch box box'

lol ssniperwolf really said  IF YOU PUT THIS IN AMERICA THEY WILL TAKE THE MONEY BOX EVEN THE FRIDGE 😫
If you want to drink coke during school
I heard about the sound effects on the toilets in the women's restroom. I watched a video one time the said its because men don't want to think that women poop. So over here we have fought to go beyond gender norms, stereotypes and misconceptions or even the "perfect body". But in some countries its still a struggle for alot of women. Don't get me wrong. We still have that issue here, but it is starting to get better.

Hey there, I know you are busy and have a lot on your mind but can you hear me out for a second. The end is very near, Jesus is coming very soon and those who aren't written in the book of life will perish in the lake of fire. Hell is very real and many are going there. And if you are wondering how to give your life to Jesus Christ just say this prayer with me.But don't just say this pray, you have to mean it.  Dear Lord, I come to you as a sinner,I know that I cannot save myself.I ask of you to save me.Jesus,I believe that you are the son of God and that you died on the cross for my sins and on the third day rose again.I repent of my sins.Father I give my life to you.I ask of you to be my Lord,my Saviour,my God and my King.I repent of my sins.I am done living for myself, I am done living for the world, Jesus I want to live 100 percent for you,In Jesus name Amen.
Wooooooooooooooooowwwwww

yo Japan got NOTHING on us! Their technology is FAR superior to ours!
The heated fridges are really useful in winter. The clear coke taste like a normal coke with a little lemon juice in it. And the robot with a tablet in the middle is called “Pepper-Kun”
Yep, true, i lived in Japan when i was Young
Japan is crazy cool, I had a great time there...and the people were Wonderful amd very helpful to me as a foreigner..Thank you Japan, btw China was amazing also...Long flight though.

You do realize McD's in the US does have mini pancakes right? Whatever is being squeezed tho I doubt we do, but mini pancakes have been around for, well I know the past 10yrs for sure is how long we been getting them.  A star cucumber 🤩
Not all of those are in Japan
I don't  live in Japan but I have seen the movie with the white spikes the movie is called the tomorrow war
I swear Japan is already in the year 2050 with all these robots and stuff!
you know for the thing of mustard and tomato sauce when you squeeze it they come out at the same time? we have that but only tomato sauce in Australia
In the first clip.. u actually should be terrified of that thing bc it caused the whole world to fight against it.. it took over cities, countries, continents (lmao).. so letting that thing (the white spike) free will probably cause the world to end :)
Omg I know that white spike, it's the creature from the tomorrow war. It's a damn good movie
They sell pancakes in Erie in McDonald’s too
Whelp guys I’m moving to Japan

I swear not lying i would love to go live in japan ive always wanted to learn a new languge theyve got all the cool stuff there and when i get back to school i would have fun stories to tell
@sssniperwolf First one was a white spike from the movie. THE TOMORROW WAR
Fun fact: clear coke was actually a top secret project of the US government for a Soviet general who requested coke from America during the late 1940’s
FINALLY A CLEAR COKE.  I JUST NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET ANY MONEY MY TELLING THEM TO DO THAT 20 YEARS AGO. SO I NEVER DID.
Happy eid ul adha

2:21 What happens when you accidentally forget to lock it? Like I’m not even sure you would even know
DAILY REMINDER: This random person loves you! :)

Hello big fan 2hen I was scrolling on YouTube if found this video called THIS VIDEO WILL MAKE YOU HATE SSSNIPER that this guy made about you it is supper bad it was made a couple of yours ago don't know if you saw it if you have not Wachovia it
🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷
If I see I White spike ill die their fast and they shoot spikes to kill humans
U used to think you were cool
The fish in the telephone booth is abuse. The fish have so little space to swim because of how narrow it is, and it is CROWDED with fish, they probably don’t get fed either; Japan has cool stuff they invented there, but they abuse animals all the time for money, and even KEYCHAINS! Look on TikTok to understand the what I mean about the keychains it sad to see a smart country abusing animals D: :/ :(
That’s it, I’m moving to Japan. My favorite movie franchise was created there anyway

If you let it go it will kill you the movie is tomorrow's war it the one at the beginning with the white spike.
The gold fish phone booth one isn’t a good idea because it can quickly turn into animal abuse or Torture if the glass get broken by, a crack head, drunk person, car accident, etc.....
It's a white spike for the tomorrow war
Oh wait i know that thats a white spike a creature from a movie called the tomorrow war its called that because he shoots bullets thats the color white  0:07         2:28   Hello titans want to die😈

Japan makes our countries and continents look like trash
The first item isn't a projection. You can see through the moving display as it travels along the street. There are cars on the other side of the trailer, which has a huge animatronics model of a chained dinosaur.

She’s not lying bro
What if it’s not sanitizing your phone what if it’s reading your phones info to hack into your phone like bruh
Im just surprised Japan still has payphones - we got rid of them here in the States pretty much immediately after cellphones became a regular thing, but, ya know... every now and then you find yourself in public and need to make a call but for some reason you dont have a charger space - its good they still exist there for emergencies
Wham bam cute melon mam 😂😂❤

Me after watching this video: "Mom can we visit Japan?"
Lia if you didn't know which I think you do but in japan they don't use dollars they use yen which is worth less that dollars so 5 dollars would be about 550 yen.
JAPAN IS THE MOST SMART COUNTRY I EVER KNOW

Clear Coke is *not* a Japan only  I seen it and Pepsi Clear for sale here, I bought it a few times too. Japan is so small, my grandpa's private land (added up) is larger.
My final form- A fat person who watches pretty, adventurous and rich people do stuff and get sad that I’m none of those things
in Japan they got watermelon bread. Laurenzside: BOBBY WE’RE GOIN TO JAPAN

To the person reading this; Even though I don’t know you, I wish you the best of what life has to offer 💚
u dont have to waste your money on the watermelons just buy the sqaure shape and grow your own watermelons
Why do I think that the white spike is cute
Spread the gospel,Amen
*Watches video* *Instantly moves to japan*
Omg this is the earliest I’ve been to ur vids
Do not free the white spike it's biologicaly engineered,it's very hostile and it can climb onto any surface in any direction (up, down, left, right, etc)
Fun fact: During WWII, Coca Cola was given to American soldiers, and even some Soviets. The Soviets really liked it. But during the Cold War, they weren't allowed to have it. So a Soviet General (I think) took the dye out of the Coke, and disguised it as a Vodka.
That spike is from tomorrow war if anybody is wondering
I cant even be able to go into a packed train, i don't like tight spaces
I need this stuff
Dafuq am I recommended this

I did not think of the benches as a centipede.
For the USA, there is a nationwide shortage of Sriracha
HELLO SSSNIPERWOLF I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
I saw a huge problem with the train video the only person wearing a mask is the one trying to shove all the non mask wearers in a tight confined space 🤔 this is why it doesn't surprise me that the coronavirus came from China or Japan I think it came from wherever they were you had hundreds of people crammed into a train without wearing a mask
the reason for the stock photo face this is because it is seen as improper for a women to open her mouth more then the width of her pinky finger so to cover it up while they eat burgers they made that :D
I wish they can make stuff like that in the US 🥺😡 Japan gets all the cool things we have suck things
bruh when I saw the white spike-  SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
This video just makes me want to live in Japan even more
Ok, for all people who don’t live in America and plan too, ZONT ZO IT ZONT COME HERE IT SUCKS THIS VIDEO HAS SHOWN ME

Lyrics  Con la tristeza que traigo me basta para perderme Voy a empezar en el vicio con una gran borrachera Tomando de día y de noche licor hasta que me muera Que triste es amar deveras y no ser correspondido Si la mujer que quieres con engaños te a ofendido Es cuando se quiebra el alma y quieres no haber nacido.  Cuando se quiere a la buena A una mujer que es traidora El dolor nos pudre el alma Y Hasta el que más hombre llora Y luego acaban borrachos Como yo me encuentro ahora.  Mujer que probó lo ajeno Ya no le busques orilla Por que si probo otros lábios Que va a cambiar es mentira Es más facíl ser infiel Que amar fiél en esta vida.  Si ya te tocó perdér Juega el albúr de tu vida Con dos cartas al destino Te aguantas o te retiras Y si decides quedarte Sabras a lo que le tiras.
Sprite or 7-Up

Not the greatest with Japanese currency but I think that watermelon was about 128-130$ USD.
Love your vids keep it up
Japan is superior
“One size fits most” made my day
0:23 Apparently you leave the phone in the case/cover? So neither the inside of it (the case) or the phone's body really gets cleaned? (Darn cleaver them Japanese.)
You are right about the yellow watermelon they are so good
I bet the phone cleaner probably scans and hacks ur phone to or something
It's just another level
Ladybug that u..
Me wondering if I should ever move to Japan to just have the luxury to experience the bathrooms that the queen of England doesn't even get

Japan is a every cool place!
I dreamt about visiting Japan for a very long time.

I didn’t know Japan was so cool 😎
Correction: Coke is actually green without colouring, they put the coke in a fertiliser to make it clear. That way, it’s healthier. Fun fact: Japan actually is one of the countries that host one of the most $u*cide deaths. In fact, their’s even a forest called “The $u*cide forest”
3:27 i can finally have a way to sneak coke into class.... *but unfortunately I dont live in Japan :/*
Japan is the FUTURE

Interesting… Ok We’re moving to Japan!
We used to have clear Pepsi but they stopped selling it along time ago. It tasted just like Pepsi.
Put that pudding shop in San Fran and they’d steal the fixtures,  break the windows, burn the building and then take a poop out front.
Heyyy I’m a huge fan, I’m early!!! ❤️
Alternative title: USA isnt fun anymore, lets lets see something else!

Fun Fact! Clear CocaCola was developed in the Cold War to smuggle to a Soviet Military Asset (A spy...) who had a taste for Coke. To disguise it, they didn't add the color and hid it in vodka bottles.
I seen butter on a stick before in America so this is not only in Japan but I actually brought any work so good

The square shaped watermelons are because New Zealand and Japan are about the same size, New Zealand has 5-6 million people, Japan has 125-126 million people, so there isn’t much space so square water melons are smaller

With the clear Coca-Cola you could rip off the label and drink it in school. The teachers would probably think it’s water.
