43:56 im from around the area there is a famous house called the limp mansion in alton famous for it paranormal
Colby looked over his shoulder
These two girls ruined the entire episode with their constant complaining, or analyzing how they FEEL about things, or making it all ABOUT THEM. Don't have them back.

Omg they need to get that man out that’s so sad she should be able to finally rest in peace 😭
What was that shadow in the window at 15:40???
Spider killer 😂😂😂
I don't claim any negative energy from this video I apologize watching this video without premission thanks for sharing this video
i love how every video sam and colby get excited over the flashlights like it doesn’t happen all the time for them😂😭
0:00 bro why did Colby not be like- *”👹WHATS UP GUYS ITS SAM AND COLBY👹”*
Tengo una teoría sobre Míchel la primera palabra que dijo fue barco que tiene relación con el río del pueblo y después dijo descomposición como cuando muere una persona . Y si significa que murió en el río  y su alma quedó atrapada en el agua del río supongo que se transportó a los lagos subterráneo y llegó a la piscina?
"6 or 7 times" 😀🤐😵‍💫
sam and colby at alveus when
❤❤❤❤
This guy was legit 20m away 2 years ago and I missed it 😢
The hosting game is a fun game besides when you turn around because that makes the spirits feel unwelcome and they become malevolent and your not allowed to do “practice strikes” in between the matches as that makes those that didn’t want to join, able to join the “game” or also invite a potential darker entity so it’s not that the ritual didn’t work it’s more like you guys made a malevolent host game
Joe bartalozzi
40:58 Did sam break the rule of not turning around? Im generally curious 🤔
47:35 Those americans and their weird measurements
Dear god the editing on this video......
Love from japan🇯🇵❤
Anyone indian🇮🇳?
In the pool it said its name was Michael, Michael is also an Angel in the bible kinda connecting it to when he kinda saved the group from the wall in november.
yo guys can you chill with the creepy music and pictures and nice vids
I'm genuinley freaking out right now. At 37:04, there are two glowing eyes on the right side of the screen in the darkness. It literally looks like someone or something is peaking out from the side of the wall. Please tell me that's just some sort of device that's lighting up.
I have a picture from here of the hallway by the stair case on the main floor. You can clearly see an orb. I don’t believe in the whole orb thing but still.
I don’t think it could be a guardian angel because guardian angels never reveal themselves ever, it’s just supposed to be a comforting presence there with you sent from God. You don’t even get to know who they are after death  At least that’s what I was told I could be wrong though
going back and watching old videos because im bored LMAO😭🤞 dude i want to do one of these SOOO BAD but im a minor so idk if that would effect anything 💔 or if i can even go on one sigh
I am quite certain that u did the ritual wrong cause even the practice rounds u took counted
potholes arent as much of a problem anymore
How he walked in was aura
Best collab ever. Waiting for a second part with you 4❤❤❤❤
can you colab with http://www.youtube.com/@markiplier
15:41 there’s a shadow at the window
Need to watch the hell fire group
I have to watch these my freaking living room now because my closet keeps opening when I watch this
They have seen flashlights turning on and off 594 times. And yet the reaction is still OOOOOHHH MY GAWD.
Wait!!! William.....afton????!!!
i dont know if its just me but at 3:10 i see like a white figure at the top right side where the light is shining and it disappears in the next scens it was like a tall figure almost touching the roof
Sam and Colby  you are handsome ♥️ ✨️
Leslie for a second I thought it's itzy chearyong
I have aracnophobia and I have to say that I almost died watching the first mins of the video😭
" Haunted for making simp " ?...
I'm going to have to fact check you guys. John Wayne gacy was not attracted to little boys. John Wayne gacy lured gay men young gay men to his home to discuss either work he needed to be done at his house or work at the construction company that he owned. He would then lure them back to his house where he would sodomize them rape them and he buried them in the basement of his home. He used his clown disguise to appeal to the masses so they would not think any differently about him or accuse him of what he was doing. He worked with the Kiwanis club he did birthday parties for children etcetera. He was not interested in young children, he was only interested in young men. Love you guys watch you tons, but take this for what it is and not for criticism just to let you know the actual story behind John Wayne gacy
The little map when they kept backing away from Colby w the camera was hilarious
"Another step forward. G*od dammit!" 😆 -Colby 2023  Edit: 48:06 had me rolling 😂
42:42 42:43 42:44 42:45 42:45 42:45 42:46 42:46 42:46 42:46 42:47 42:47
hi

Im watching and commenting on every single explore video and counting them Video:191
I do not allow any negative energy, entities, spirits of anything else to come around me or loved ones while watching this series. Thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you for everything you guys do. I’m sorry for glances I made that I shouldn’t have. I nor the people watching it do not claim any negative energy from this video
Sam: We're going to do a ritual.  Sam: It's called the hosting game. Me: *immediate flashback to 2017* Me, out loud: You're a moron.
Ok maybe I’m trippen but did yall she the shadow in the window it could have very well been one of them moving but it was a little sus 15:41
at 15:41 look between Valkyrae and Fuslie something is behind that window you can see the shadow and i don't think it was the light cause the camra light would not cause that and i cant be Sam or Colby cause the figure looked distorted like a hunchback almost idk it might me nothing yall can tell me what it is idk   Also look at the window behind the guild its like the figure continued over
37:05 white eyes in the doorway maybe a kid spirit
8:16 “Named WiliAm” WILLIAM AFTON TS U?
I would like to sign up to be a guest on the show. 😎
I don't claim any negative energy while watching this video amen 🙏
didnt know yall went to my town 1 year ago
at 27:56 after colby said they locked up 20 mins ago and it all went quiet you can hear a loud crash sound like something fell
1:25 Wtf Colby? LOL
Anyone else notice how the shadow figure that throws rocks is supposedly named Michael and they got the name Michael at the pool??
26:10 i definitely misheard what Rae said I was like pause
15:40 Am I insane or is there a shadow behind the window covering?
I am protected by Jesus Christ and my Spirit Guides. I don't claim anything negative or evil from this video.  In Jesus Name Amen 🙏 🙌 ❤❤ 0:50
Valkyrae❤❤❤❤
how am i just now seeing this and i live 10 minutes from here😭
55:25 I know I'm late but could you possibly do something with smokeebee?
I fell like that Sam and Colby should do a investigation when they are drunk or is it just me
At 1:07:31 in the photo u can see a little girls face between Rae and Colby
Sam and Colby what what does it mean like when the so I'm on the part where you guys see the figures and in the in the Carol's room I don't know her name I forgot it
Didn't imagine Rae and Fuslie to be here😂
worst video to watch while eating spicy ramen damn😭
Yall sharing the rum with me to😂😂
Is Colby with the whole bottle of rum for me😂😂😂😂
John sounds like someone else I know… someone who may or may not always come back iykyk
1:27 of all the ways to do a transition 😭😭😭🙏🥀🥀🥀
the way Sam and Rae were talking and like holding eachother while scared when Colby and Leslie were under made me smile
😮😮
around 27 min everyone being quiet Sam - HELLO
Clarence would seem like a nice guy but the kids that died that’s so sad in the pool like imagine dying on your birthday
Ryan Trahan please
omg i would love for them to collab with shane and amanda, especially after the overnight at smosh video
Leslie:I got a little pain rifht her maybe thats diner not sure maybe my periods coming Sam: PERI—😨 Bro panicked🙏😭
when u guys were talking about the girl i saw a shadow outside
This has to be the happiest ghost hunting ever lol
I'll say no to spiders .
This gives me throwback to when they first ever did the host game. Was a much different story
8:16, no the ghost is my brother?! 😂
Anybody here in 2025?❤
47:50 Colby has had it… it seems size does matter
I swear the turned around at least once
15:40 I saw shadow move fast
26:09 YOUR WHAT IS OFF
I got a good energy from this video , honestly 😂❤
mememe
Your guide makes me uncomfortable now watching this again a year later tbhhh… especially towards the girls
Who doesn’t believe Sam and Colby the flashlight is turning on is all true guys they would never lie to us❤
I think it’s time that Sam and Colby should have a gaming channel and play phasmaphobia for the first ever game
Would y'all ever go to duddly town in CT?
2025 anyone?  Also, I felt like this video wasn't even that long ago but 2 years ago? I mean dang, I've been a fan since the abandoned days, that was forever ago mannn😭
Who's here in 2026 👆
Why did they wanna help George? Fuck him, he can stay trapped. Pearl on the other hand deserves freedom
Me
I live thirty minutes from there. Every single time I enter the town I have this like weird feeling.😐
Wish Sam and Colby could collab with Laurenzside 🥲
They said a 7'0 tall  shadow named William I'm also named William and I'm also 7'0 tall that's wild
A lobotomy takes out your frontal lobe.
15:40 wht is that behind window😮look like a shadow
Idk but 15:18 or 15:16 their was a shadow in the back window
Words of wisdom  “Bébé” -Colby “But their so small and cute:(“ -Colby
Literally loved Dave seemed like a lovely guy
I never knew that place was haunted but it did look like it we would drive by all kinds of places while leaving or going to raging rivers
54:12 is it js me or do their eyes look MAJESTIC in the night vision cameras
BRO I SAW EYES
1.Lady In White  2.Lady In Red 3.Lady in Blue That’s crazy
I clam no negative energy from this video
Bros failed the 2 man mission 😢
sam and colby is like so carinngg like whenever someone feels ill they tell do u wanna take a break and i also saw it on multiple other vids
Did anyone see shadows walking in the window
22:50 I work at a Holiday Inn and we have had a couple deaths here. Mostly old people and unfortunately suicides.
1:27 how were you assaulted? I was singed by Colby Brock, did you like it. hell yeah!
So basically if you come to where this hotel it is at stay in the lobby party in the lobby the ghost love it
Colby “I have demons attached to me in every hole” Sam “ I’m every hole?” Meanwhile the girls “ I don’t like it down here” - “I’m scared”
10:51   Bro is it just me cause i see an orb
37:04 is it just me or are there white eyes in the right doorway
Hate how sometimes the video shows black screen and I see my reflection and makes me feel like something's behind me
I know it would be a bit hard to do with his desire ofr privacy but seeing CORPSE do a ghost hunting would be so cool. Like they do what Anthony padilla did.
37:04 did u not awe the glowing things like eyes??
5:21 my type of people
"BEBE" 😂😂
At 15:40 there was a shadow in the window I don't know if it was Colby moving but I had to rewind like 4 times there was definitely a shadow in the window
8:16 “named WiLlIaM”
44:01to 44:18 is scary considering my name is michael
23:21  LMAOO this part 😭
Gacy didn't kill while dressed as a clown. He dressed up as 1 during town parades and events etc. And he didn't lure or go after kids. He went after grown men. Regardless, what do you expect from someone involved in local politics and was also a Democrat? 🤡 Dead giveaway 😂
YALL SHOULD HAVE LAURNZSIDE
Guys it said *cousin only kept harry*
I know this is a late comment, but this could just be a coincidence, but as soon as you said, the word, Cassie my name is Cassie and it was my birthday two days ago so that could just be coincidence but I think it was kind of scary I guess  Edit I also can’t swim in on my fifth birthday party. I almost drowned.
Me encanta la pista en español🎉
I love these guys y'all should follow
Real fans can like my Comment
I can't believe I'm just now watching this, I'm still watching it as I type and I don't know if anyone else picked up on it. However, It seems Valkyrae seems to be feeling everything a lot more than everyone else and how the guide said she'd be good 'bait' makes me feel like she might be clairvoyant or an empath of some kind but because she's never had any experiences, she never realized it.

Valkyrie. next see would here's thanks wanna amazing office for stimulus me cool ghosts off when I get home from nice 💯
So am i like the only one who saw eyes in 37:56?..
guys dont swear ghosts dosent really like things like that
Is it weird that I ship Leslie and Sam. Because when they were doing the Estes method the way Sam was there and held Leslie’s arm just made me think he likes her.
No, is this a coincidence it stopped for me at 55:55 😰
did anyone of u saw the shadow figure passing through one of the windows at 16:00
28:40 Queue transition  That should be in every video they should do 😂😂😂😂
24:46 Colby be like  God damn what did I just drink  My gawd Cheers to Lou 😂
as someone who lives 15 minutes from Alton and goes there every Monday, I’m scared
I live in Illinois
at 22:12 theres a black blob that goes acrost the sxreen
Those freaking pics are more scary 😭
its like ldy in red but lady in blue
Sam when you said how do you feel pearl Colby said sick and rae said annoying but you only pointed out what rae said
2:46 IS THAT A GD REFRENCE!?!?!?!?!?!?
How did I miss this one, I live 20 mins away from Alton lol
The lady in red vs the lady in blue
Wait was the host game done cuz at 41:51 colby looked over his sholder
16:02 wtf was the shadow on the window.
26:29 what do you mean by that Val?
Am I dumb or did I see something moving behind the makeshift plastic curtain in the center 16:00
❤
I am sad for Pearl. I hope someone would go and free her from that hell she is still living even after she died.
1:02:04 he was abusive and prolly got asked why "cuz i felt like it"
Rewatching this a year later.. I think Jodi and Syd should be on a show!!!
who here in 2025?
Bring ishow speed in your videos
Tbh I used to be scared but now that I have watched every single video of sam and colby I don't have a fear of hauntings etc. And also the creepy pictures that u use to describe demons or any character is literally creepy. btw ur vids are lovely.
I was meant to comment this when this first uploaded but…  YOUR SAYING I COULD’VE AT LEAST PASSED THEM SOMEWHERE WHEN THEY VISITED ALTON?!?!
I claim no negative energy from this video. Amen
The fact that Leslie was holding Rae’s arm was so cute 🥹🥹
Am I he only one that isn’t scared of the pictures bro😂
13:41 😂
At 26:30 did she say, "my vibrator was off?" LOL I swear she did. lol
46:32 Michael the arc angel…?
I love you guys so much. ❤ you guys need to come back to Alton and explore more!!!
When Rae said "Annoying" in the Estes method, Colby said "Sit" in the background.
We gotta get ships for Sam and Colby
Uh guys? Sam and colby lasted video was like 2y or 1y. What happened?
White hat girl is stunnningggg
Que bueno q estén doblando al español, están muy buenos sus videos, me encantan
51:22
I do not allow any negative energy's follow me or my loved ones. Thanks for letting me know your story and I'm sorry what happen to you. Dear God please give any good energy's and spirits peace. Rest in peace 🙏
I’m just tryna eat my kitkat but for some reason if I’m like hearing about history related stuff or paranormal it just makes me lost my hunger yk
44:47  when the alice box said "Limp" maybe it was talking about the Limp brewery or Limp Mansion on Limp street in St.  louis MO.. someone or something had made it through the portal.
37:57 looks like theres 2 pairs of eyes staring into the room in the right lower side,actually hella creepy how nobody noticed 🙆🏾‍♂️
istg Sallie hasn't left Sam's crack. Like bro, there have been so many investigations where it gives the impression Sallie is still there.          My opinion on Night Swim: it was disappointing. Not a scary movie, not creepy, a bit boring
Wow
Bring the ZHC crew out!!  Including both Davids!
it would be crazy if yall got vanoss crew to go to a haunted house
Being scared of the video vs the random pictures
song of 1:08:32 ?? PLSSS
41:53 colby why did you turn around man
I want to see Shane Madej do the hosting game
23:10 that statue next to valkraye keeps freaking me tf out cuz it’s like a tall shadow figure type thing
Oh My God Leslie is hysterical with that Estes method, I mean just calm down, you wanted to join in anyway, then you can keep calm for a while, and you have Rae on your arm, she will be scared by her behavior, I would have grabbed her by the arm and taken her outside and said, calm down with your screaming, you can just wait here because I am not waiting for that screaming, I did not find this episode that great or did I get impressed, too bad. Maybe a tip if they really act hysterical, go outside to calm down.
11:42 he basically was saved by someones patronus
I hope i can be with you too❤ From: Philippines
I'm watching the part where the guide explains his encounter with the white ball of light and i got a story similar from when i was a kid. I remember it was night and i got up to drink some water, as I'm climbing the counter because i am a kid and can't reach the cups, i see a bright big ball of light that looks like a star with multiple end points. It was floating above the ground and was the size as the chain link fence. When i ran to my mom to tell her what i saw, it disappeared. i never had an encounter like that after except one time at school but ever since, I've never seen anything like it 😅
in 37:57 there was two eyes peeking in that door . sam didnt you saw it
bro this is like 30 min away from me
37:56 are those eyes in the doorway?..
Nunca pensé en qué seguro qué ustedes no me entiendan por hablar español.... Pero igual  Sam y Colby ustedes son los mejores por "asustar" mi dia .... ❤❤❤❤ 👍👍👍
you should totally bring amanda here
I never knew that I lived so close to somewhere that is so spiritual! 😂
Tranquilos que falso no es la investigacion!!! Estoy en la Parte de ofrenda del Wuisky y Puedo percibir el olor ... que Pasada❤
This one was not good bro
Demon in the dark.
At 22.17 something went by behind the girls
34:10 chairs 🪑 😮🤐
9:23 what if it was the lady that someone said that she was throwing rocks (i dont remember who said it) but she could get a rock and throw it
Why do the girls alllwayyyys feel "Ssoooo heavy" and "Soooooo sick." Every. Episode. Wild.
35:26 😬😬😬
leslie is destracted about something i swear
It’s a good day when Sam and Colby have become so big that they’re advertising mainstream movies on their channel.
16:01 look at the window 😀
26:29 LMFAO WHAT DID SHE SAY?
I love watching Sam and Colby bc they make me not to☠️myself
Caylus
Do one with unspeakable
I want you to come back to America
I was born in America
Around 16:00 wt's that shadow movement behind the window
George and Pearl were not holding back🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love how Valkyrie and fuslie are holding arms durning the Estes method❤❤❤❤True friendship❤❤❤❤❤
Dude I live in bethalto it's like 15 mins away from alton
48:13
Am I tripping, or is there, like, a pair of eyes just staring at you guys through the door at 37:55?
Make me famous (not begging)
They said there was a shadow figure that throws rocks at you and when the crash happened they said it sounds like a rock 😮😮
I want you to go in a haunted palace where are Queen is has been died and I like you videos I watch your videos every time
When they started talking about george and they panned to the window it looked like a man squatted down walking
I'm so sorry pearl!! It's terrible to be on a loop of abusive torture I feel really bad for her soul!!😢😢
22:50 Imagine walking around, coming back and the cups are empty 🙃
There the F do you guys find these beautiful girls everytime?? I've been looking on ebay and amazon but they are always sold out..
1:03:50  What if geroge pit poison in pearls cocktail and then she died?????

Y’all should take Niko Ortiz on a hunt 😂
Don't forget the mimic

In America it is very easy to become a ghost hunter because all the haunted buildings are Updated😂😂😂👌👌
Invite Matt Rife
At 14:21 Sam says” I’m a woman” doesn’t that kind of explain why Sam and Colby are kind of gay all the time🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone here in 2025?
Imagine how funny it would be with corpse
16:00 IS NO ONE EVEN GONNA NOTICE THE SHADOW OUTSIDE THE WINDOW ??
35:17 I love how everyone hides behind Colby 😂😂❤
Wait my name is harry. What does that mean 😢😢
16:00 look at the window
I think I saw shadow moving in the windows when they were talking about the Lady in blue
I have a hoodie from that store
Don't ever  bring them again.. they ruined the whole video.
Did anyone notice that at 16:00 behind Leslie in the window i saw a shadow figure moving ,I don't know if it is real or not .😅
41:54 Colby!!!! You turned!!
Aquí los que vienen del canal de fedeeee
The amount of disrespect S&C have for other people's property is offensive
Colby, why you throwing us in your crotch? Lmao!!
Tjat guide automatically took the side of Pearle, the woman that died at the Mineral Springs hotel and claimed she was an innocent victim and the husband was the bad guy, but how does he know she wasn't a terrible wife. Maybe she was unfaithful, or abusive to him. That guy does seem a bit effeminate and so he's probably the cuck type that is submissive to women when its supposed to be the other way around. If I ever investigate that hotel I'm going to find out George's side of the story
Selena best of wishes to a new non demonic home... Many Wishes girl....
I DO NOT ALLOW ANY NEGATIVE ENERGY TO COME FROM THIS VIDEO AND HARM TO ME MY LOVED ONES  OR  FOR PEOPLE  WHO WATCH THIS VIDEO . I RESPECT YOU SPIRITS
i wish sam and colby  would explore djin based lore and tie it into their investigations, seeing the culture mashup in that unique way would be incredible
So I was sitting on my couch watching this and I got and overwhelming smell of cologne. The only person I know that wears cologne is my dad but he only wears it when we go out and we haven't gone out in like 3 weeks. It also doesn't help that he's outside  and has been for like 2 hours. I know what kind of cologne he wears and it does not smell like what I just smelled. I dont know if this will help but this happened at 39:36 Can someone debunk this? Im kinda freaked out😭
I'm from Mexico but I like watching your videos
I'm very scared, but I really like your videos and I've been watching them for 4 years.
Where did you guys learn of the hosting game ritual? Very curious.
16:00 is it just me pls correct me if im wrong but was that a shadow figure behind that girl or is it her shadow for the light of the camera!?
13:38 me when stairs in school
Do some more with kris and Salina
Minuto 16.01 se be una sombra parar atrás de la chica por la bentana😮
Why sam and colby why are you guys doing this
Hi, how can I share what we captured in this video?
15:58  I saw a shadow pass by the window or am I trippin???
Could William be…William Afton???? William Afton is 6’4” it could in theory be him.
Sadly live in Alton never saw or expience anything haunted I live in Alton and explored everyone multiple time and still nothing sadly atleast over a year
The fact that they have damn UNIVERSAL sponsoring their stuff is INSANE!! They’ve come soooo far! ❤❤🎉🎉
37:57 that looks like eyes-
1:04:39 the arm grab😲
Sam saying hello like the ghost is going to say what’s  up my brother
we'll come back! Sam: 👀 48:58 🤣🤣
right mateys. let me get this straight. there are things we can’t see touching the flashlights? you guys are like “oop something just made that flashlight turn on which we can’t even see! who cares?” 😁
there was a shadow figure ducking behind rae at 20:12!!!!
I wood love can with you
Even spirits love a bottle of good ol Jack Daniels
trevor wallace please
These girls are so Noisy, Annoying &Childish behavior!  Why go and visit a Haunted Area, if you cannot listen to your surroundings! I’m so annoyed with “l can’t”!1111111111111
0:00 BRO SCARD ME
I love Sam and Colby Sam and Colby 4 life ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Hear me out.. Sam and Colby.. know as the ghost kings. Most haunted town in America. it makes the most since for the ghost kings in the town of ghost. they should move there lol.
Can u do the mcpike I've veen there,heard knocking by the front door and more it was awesome expirence
When the emf reader said Bracelet, it may have been talking about or to Colby. Bc he's the only one with bracelets but it didn't know Colby's name, so it said the accessory he had on, to point to him.
Every time I watch your videos I get scared
26:30 Colby’s face when she said this was crazy
I liked this collab❤😂
48:51 We all know they weren’t talking abt popcorn 😂😂😂😂
56:28  theyre asking for our fav creators but they are my fav creators ❤
Just visited Grafton
This reminds me of the song slaughter house by ren gill
I saw a shadow move really fast at the window  where y'all guys who were standing the number is 15:36
you guys should go somewhere with benoftheweek
They need to go brushy mountain state pen in Tennessee!!
I feel like the chairs in the pearl room is 100% debunk able, the arms and legs follow the legs and arms of the chair and the two with spirits are the only two of that type of chair the others without spirits are different types of chairs, tell me if I’m right
I totally remember this ritual form sams 3am challenge era, thats when I started watching these guys and I remember him doing it at the trap house
You guys should do a collab with Jacksepticeye! He's really funny in his videos and seems really nice so I think it would make a really good video x
16 minute mark you can see what looks like a woman leaving the room while he’s telling the story of how she died. Right after he tells you it took 3 days look in the middle window. (Might be a car or something idk)
They should bring caseoh next time they go on a investigation
IM SO EXCITED FOR YOUR LIVE AND NEW VID TODAY
You need toast in one of these
25:16 my first thought “have fun trying to find someone to drive 😀”
Did anyone else see the eyes at 37:50 behind them
Lou seems really chill the vibes I’m getting are like your my friend now
2025 6th time whatching this
Girl in the white hat🥰💘
30:22  Sam: "speaking of going down, let's go to the pool" Colby: "i thought you were talking about something else" Sam:"What- 👁👄👁"
I just noticed someone peeking out from the window behind sam guys 23:03 look carefully..... Am I the only one to notice it 😮😅
Anyone else notice  during the walkthrough at 15:55 - 16:02 it looks like a full body figure walks past the plastic covered window. While they are talking about pearl.
Colby and Rae would be the the best couple who agrees ❤
The one Spirit that keep on touching the light was like💃🕺💃🕺
I know you guys are taking a break from the channel right now 😞 but I wanted to let you know this story is EXACTLY the same as a haunted place in Texas called Mineral Wells. They had the same mineral water, thought to cure people, and a hotel there also. I think Zak Bagins went there, or ghosthunters. Same story though. Hope we see a new video from you soon!!! You can’t quit, you just bought a school!!
16:00 there is a shadow that passes by the window as soon as he says “3days”
Bro in science yesterday we learned about aquifers!! I HATE science!!!!!
@kelsidaviss
The SLS on the chair makes sense once you know what the software is actually doing.  It is TRYING to find a way to put a human skeleton on something and the chair that had nothing had a large gap so the software couldn't do it.  I'm not a skeptic, and the SLS can be a useful tool, but you need to understand it to know it's limitations.
at 16:00 minutes a shadow goes past the window
😂
I love both Rae and Leslie so seeing you guys all collab made me so excited! I loved seeing how respectful Rae and Leslie were. It must've been terrifying though, respect to them for taking part in this.
this is giving secret of sulphur springs vibes
Not even 10 minutes into the video and you scare me with these scary ass pictures
Please take caylus with...He is like a gamerrr he is amazing Pleaseeeeeee😢❤
Man valkyrae is that girl. That final girl. Leslie is first to go. Just saying.
I LOVE your videos Sam and Colby!!! and it was insane how they had a conversation during the estes method (idk if I spelled it right)
Did anyone see the chair move at 43 :25
I like when at 53:07 you put a soundalike to the score to Halloween when they say the name "Michael" LMAO
1:46 where we going? 👀 i’m interested
Am I the only who didn’t move their necks while they were playing the hosting game😅😅?
At 1:01:27 when it said don’t turn in the game you can’t turn your head around and maybe the could have been following you guys.
I can just imagine the bangs as ghosts trying to follow, accidentally tripping, and yelling“F**K!” And then another ones like “really terry? Your scaring them!  Edit: George I literally hate you
7:01 sams hair in this part 😂😂
did i hear my vibratior is off?
Those two girls are ruining the investigation.
So in the pool the alice box said micheal. After that they talked about how th orb saved the guide. Micheal is a archangle in chritianity
Larry German comment Sam and Colby, enjoying my friend
2025

The guy with the white ball story is full of shit 😂 a white ball expanded to 7ft tall and it blasted me against the wall and I still come back every night blah blah blah blah stfu 😂
"im feeling shakyy :(" is so relatable
Guys, when you guys were splitting up, and u guys was talking down the basement I literally saw a figure with no shirt on standing there
1:04:51
1:02:19 Sam and Leslie’s energy match LOL 😂❤
24:46 😂😂😂
The flashlights turn on and off due to heat fluctuations inside it. It’s natural not a ghost. The other evidence is pretty convincing tho
NOT ME SAYING: KAKAKKAKABABABABABUAUAUA every Scary moments
Jaws didn't make me fear water, Science did that!
i live so close to  theereeeeeee they needa come backkkk
37:58 The eyes are so creepy
15:58 OK IS IT JUST ME OR DID YALL SEE THIS TO when ever it pans back to Valkyrae and Fuslie there is A GODDAMN FIGURE SPRINTING PAST THE WINDOW COVERED WITH PLASTIC ok so it could of been a light that could be very possible but if you look at the light if you would ask me that’s looking ALOT LIKE A WOMEN NGL-

Anytime something happens: Sam: HeLLo
51:40 when Colby thought they were asking the mouses name and he was like “miickeey” I DROPPED TO THE FLOOR LAUGHING😂😂😂😂
Hiiiii
bionaural beats only work with headphones. thats why they are called BI(both)NAURAL(ears) beats. you should try to astral travel when in one o these places. or maybe smoke some dmt if you are scared of not being able to find your body again when astral taveling.
15:59 a shadow passes behind the window next to one of the girls
after watching you guys again and the investigations, i had a dream that repeated similarly past few nights where i was joining you guys and others in the paranormal investigations. I was ready to get it over with as i am easily to get scared and I am an emotional empath! i feel what others feel but as soon as it started and at the end i was so shooked i became speechless until i said i 100% believe in the paranormal. Love you guys :D enjoy watching you guys becoming brave each time you do this.
People here in 2025 and watched that movie yesterday 1-6-25
lol its funny to think they just left Rae and Leslie and went to Canada at 53:32

55:44 "harry was the only cousion i have"

I got litreal chills from"I'm watching"and I felt like pressure on my chest throughout the pool thing
25:20 bro im kind of an alcohol enjoyer and my first questi9n would be if the ghost wants me to chug the bottle of wiskey.
Find it so funny how colby kept turning around during the ritual 😭😭😭
Just incase op it happens to other people when u watch this, Spirits from this video I’m not apart of this game plz don’t come for me bc I already turned around over my shoulder 😢, God plz send down angels bc I don’t know if the games counts if u watch the vid

*Rae and Leslie absolutely traumatized* Sam and Colby: "Go check out Zumie!" "Thank you for subscribing!"
Was that Michal from the crescent hotel?

I do not allow any negative energy, entities, spirits of anything else to come around me or loved ones while watching this series. Thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you for everything you guys do. I’m sorry for glances I made that I shouldn’t have. I nor the people watching it do not claim any negative energy from this video.
@samandcolby  You missed SO much cool stuff in Alton and St. Louis. In Alton, there is the Lovejoy cemetery with a semi-secret spot that is consistently active, the old Civil War prison, the place where the Confederate soldiers from the prison were buried,  the McPike mansion, a lot of the buildings in the downtown area, and at least one bar that's pretty active. Then, there is the stuff in St. Louis proper.  You could hit up the Lemp mansion.  I experienced something that I believe was non-human there.  Probably a long-dead pet like a cat or a small dog. There is also the actual house that the kid lived in that inspired "The Exorcist" as well as the hospital that was associated with that case.  I hear that the location was made into apartments.  THAT should make some good interviews right there. If you plan on coming out this way, hit me up.  With enough advanced warning, I might be able to put together a homemade EM pump.
They say”don’t ship us” they share a drink and other something I have seen on TikTok😭😂
25:11 be like: ghost drinking party (w/ sam and colby + Valkyrae & Fuslie)
I would love for y'all to have Daz Games in here again!
I need to go to one of these places bc my house is haunted but not as much as these AMAZING vids
The dual estes method was creepy af, I got chills all over my body
10:18 Rea looked scared as shit
ok hear me out but could u do a collab with AMP?
Bro, at 36:52 to 36:55, Sam's hair moves, yall, i swear I'm not joking.
Hey
hell yeah, i was born in alton.
16:00 Y'all saw that in the window or whatever that is in the background? It was like a shadow figure getting up and running off
My hometown! I love it here!!
15:99 when he says 3 there is a shadow of something passing by in the window!!!!😮
At 16:00 look at the window a shadow moves across it
I think it would be awesome if Sam and Colby did a phasmaphobia game, comparing it to real life experiences 😂 Y’all do such good stuff, thank you ❤❤
I thought Valkyrae said “oh my vibrators off” not vibe reader 😂😂😂 I was like woah excuse me..😅
16:01 WHAT WAS THAT IN THE FRICKING WINDOW
Just saw a figure standing in a corner before they take the stairs to the top floor
Listen to the old man he has learned a lifetime yours  and to the girls they can see your lights and they are attracted    To you
Listen to the old man he has learned a lifetime yours
I'm convinced Sam and Colby make up these rituals to freak out the guests 😅
19:09 they js got 2 close lol
Fnaf lore in a hotel????????
59:30 Doesn't it look like a fight between a wife and a husband
leslie is so funny
if you guys ever come to utah to ghotst hunt i would love to be invited a new a couple of scary places in utah my name is holland taylor
Leslie is so me tho
I’m only 3 hours away from this place😭
3:29 as someone who works at a butchery I can confirm that is definitely not what they hang pigs on
RAE CAME TO ALTON???? AND I DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT
Okay this has nothing to do with the video but I fell asleep watching this last night and I woke up to my little pony playing, I am so confused to how that happened, I’ve never even watched my little pony
41:54  colby looked back twisting his body
15:59 look at the green window like and you see a shadow figure like floating by
If Celina fell asleep in the haunted house, I'm sure the ghosts would be much more terrified of her, than she would be of them.
15:59 window in the background scared the crap out of me, I know it was probably someone in the other room but still 😅
The way that leslie and ray are scared af while colby and sam are just promoting their sponsor
IK THIS COMMENT IS KINDA LATE...but at 56:02 to 56:05  if you watch it at 0.25x (pause the video exactly at 56:04 )speed you can literally see a shadow figure to the right of the first pole(and thats when lesli said that she heard that) and as soon as they turn around..that shadow figure just moves towards they left soo quick I tried to de-dunk this but it looks so evident that theres a darker shadow than the shadow casted by the pillar that looks like a stick figure Hope this reaches sam and colby or any other clip farming youtube channels
Would be fck up if Fuslie just ask lou all the time and lou attach Fuslie dude
15:59....there was someone behind them in the room 😮😮😮😮
Sam and Colby a little to local
Im currently 2 hours away from this place…. I should go
Ghost hunting with Mark and Ethan would be amazing
“dont look behind ur back” and colby “CASSIEE”
Shouldve started playing "Charlie, Charlie, are you here?" in the well hahaha good memories
my mom went to this area and took a photo with my sister (Allton Cemtery) and she got a photo with a demon! im going there soon as well!!
Sac
Heyyyy

I live in Alton
Hi I'm your fan l can't wait to meet you all😊😊
edinbrugh castle
I feel like Rae didn't get much during the Estes method because fuslie was holding onto her so she probably couldn't go into her trance fully
I'm a YouTube and I think u should talk about this but you guys are goest Hunte 're so here when ever I go to a brave yard I feel spirit's to thorough me
Ladies you are only scared..... as Sam screams OHHHHH MY GAWD at literally anything and everything 100 times a video.
37:58 am i crazy or am i seeing a full head in the doorway
The "EXCUES ME" at 0:10:43-0:10:45 and that they claimed her to be her trigger bait for that night lmao

My last name is harwood
Y
15:58 background? @samandcolby
I want to order something from XPLR but I somehow can’t..is it because I’m from Europe? 😢
I just love it. first video that I can watch in night don't scared it make so good vibes with them all, so just love it ❤
Anyone else see the door move at 34:22 ??
wait i just thought about it what if u do a backflip to see what's behind u? its technically not looking behind your shoulder
We go here two times a year to visit my grandparents😭 2:16 we go over that bridge every time we visit 😭😭
I claim no evil spirits from this video
“In Alton illinois.”  Oh hey I live an hour from there-! *relizing Sam and Colby were an hour away from me* AW man..-
People that arent scared of the video but are scared from the random pictures/videos that jumpscare you.👇
5:28  I’m eating a pig😭
On god I saw a person run in the background😮
I think that what made Lou mad was when you guys called him an alcoholic. That was a very unkind word back in the day.
Wait I bent there it was not happy for me to get in that house
Leslie: that is sickening and won’t happen. Their is no way they are going to be like Rae go this way, Leslie go this way, and we go that way. That won’t happen Sam and Colby: Is that a challenge 😈. You have no idea what you’re in for
man i was so crossed when i watched night swim i cried 🥲
at 37:57 there were 2 sets of bright eyes looking through the wider door?
15:56 I’m I the only one that saw a shadow running?
is it just me or do colbys shoes look so animater rn
Great video. This is creepy.👍👍😀The way the ghosts respond back to you guys is crazy. It brings chills down to my spine.
16:56
Colby is comfirmed me fs 💀
1:03:02 “he stole it” means he took her ring back😮😮😮😮😮😊😊
37:57 UHHH THE EYES???!!!
18:20 it was pure comedy from here 😂😂
👍🏽👍🏽
Lol the thing that weirded me out was when you guys were in the pool and asked, "Can you give us a name"? and in my head I said "Michael" and then the alice box said the name 💀
Thanks for an amazing 2023 year. It would be cool if you did a video with Jaden animations.
“May I touch your hand?” When showing an example🥹 This guy is great❤
Imagine being sponsored by Universal😮 congrats you guys!
Guys im sorry for saying this but wich one of Sam and wich one of colby?
IDK if any of ya''ll looked it up but Phasmophobia isn't just a game... Its the phobia of ghosts....AKA a persistent fear of ghosts. It kinda fits pretty well here.
Keep yall notifcations on sam and colby channel they be on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trying to comment on all of your videos!!
12:46 Like Guiding Light from DOORS
You guys should go to Earlsboro Oklahoma It’s one of the most haunted towns in Oklahoma
I think you should contact impulsesv and skizzleman for them to be in one of your haunted videos
At 23:47 i heard a woman crying, i have headphones on full blast
HELP I LIVE NEAR ALTON😭
Colby, I like your pants where do you get them?
I'm sad im in England cant watch the film
I rewatched this and realized they said Tina in Farrah school
I do NOT allow any negative energy or dark entities to stay or follow me or my loved ones, thanks you Sam and Colby for your work.
Good Gravy Man! Can’t you light a match? You put your pointing finger on the match head. The red part!
That pool is very Silent Hill 2-ish.
Sooo immature. One of the rules, if not THE number one rule in order to go on a Paranormal Investigation is to not drink. Come on guys!
Who’s John Gacy?!? I can’t.
Is it me or did S&C lose their sense of direction? Vids feel more amateurish and immature.
#1 person is to be more scared of spiders that the paranormal 😂 Love the videos guys! Keep up the good work!!
Pearl deserved a better husband than here current one who a$bused her
IDK about the SLS tool. It picks up human figures because the chairs are vaguely shaped like people. If you notice, the legs line up exactly with the legs of the chair and at the same point where the chair legs contact the ground. The same thing for the arms...they line up with the backrest posts. The empty chair was empty because when the chair is angled, it no longer vaguely looks human, so the tool doesn't recognize it.
21:39 Why would they use Ai to create this photo?
Me, my family and my friends do not attract any cursed energy from this video.
“Knocked you up like you really felt it?” ☠️☠️
imagine krew going on a ghost hunt with sam and colby!!
I saw the movie i shitjes my pants
I love Leslie and Rae so much they brought a certain energy to the video that I never knew I needed
I love yall soooooooo much and I love the videos
✨WeLcOmE tO tHe SlAuGhTeR hOuSe✨
You guys should bring out #Badbishlily & #KillSMartyr
42:15  i was making a bracelet when it Said it😂
37:58 green eyes??
I know this may be late but; at 42:30 there is a small ghost figure on the top of the pool behind the girl that’s near the chair.
Lowkey Hold on people what if they did a ghost hunt with LarenZside
I think the white light he saw was archangel Micheal protecting him because the Alice box said Micheal
Leslie and Rae : shitting tears Sam And Colby : Anyways guys their crushing ur Uhm, thanks for the support everyone ur means a lot❤
Sam and colby i want you to know thad when you were at the barr i saw a black shadow behind sam  i,t spooked mi out i dont know if your even gona read mi comment
Idea:u can collabe with " night of luxury"
them being in the bottling factory and being terrified that it was actually a slaughter house is cracking me up 😭
Alice box : gag  Leslie literally like gaging over there and Sam is like are u mimicking it and she’s like no no no not in a mean wayy
Should take smosh on one of your ghost hunt
The girls talk way to much
At 30:35/36 a disembodied Male voice say's,..... ( I HATE YOU ! )😮n the midst of the group talking you have to have ears to hear ,
SAM AND COLBY WAS IN MY STATE OMFG I'M PISSING SHITTING BAWLING MY EYES OUT THROWING UP BLEEDING AHHOSNSHHEJSJSBSHS
why did the shadow move weird on the yellow plastic 15:57
Only Sam and Colby fans are aloud to like this comment
Who else sees the eyes in the door at 37:57
U can take me for an adventure 😁
19:22 not the lobotomy tools after I mentioned lobotomies 😅
The window behind the girl standing
16:00 look in the window you will see a shadow of a 7ft tall man
The Cascade Job Corps center in Sedro - Woolley Washington used to be Northern State Mental Hospital where they used to perform things such as lobotomies and other messed up things, there are also graves marked and unmarked nearby the old abandoned hospital walls and the entire place is haunted. I was a student at that Job Corps center and witnessed a few things first hand including a window screen being ripped out from the second story while watching a horror film in the lounge area. I recommend you guys go check it out and possibly create a video from it. Celina, Kris and Niki should go with too (empaths). @samandcolby
Leslie was over reacting
These two girls are annoying ; don’t come on the show again sheesh
I'm months late but my mother in law is from Alton...she can confirm it's haunted
24:44 Hahaah Colby was so caught off guard…
i live in alton
Should have brought sykunno as well, but I would love to see him as well as kubscoutz
Extremely late to the party with this video, but have just been introduced to Sam and Colby and been watching all their videos and I must say that Lesley and Rae have been the absolute best guests so far apart from Nate. What an amazing episode, literally got heart attacks
unspeakable
hi sam
Use the dual Estes method more often so cool
16:00 a shadow passed through the window
1:02:30 Ghost orb near Rae. Watch on .25x speed, literally crazy bro
I would love to be able to come now ghost hunt with you guys, it would be interesting to test my empath/medium abilities
38:10 deep end as in stray kids 😦? (LMAO JUST A JOKE)
Guys while watching this I didn’t bite my self I’ve got a bite mark on my finger I didn’t bite my finger
celina and kris plzzz?
8:52 when Colby said “named William “ literally killed me 😂
i do not allow any negitive engery to effect me or my loved ones amen
I think it would be so funny if @nickwilkins did a collab 😂
i said the ritual with you guys but right now my shoulders are in pain for some reason but awesome video!!!!!!
Did anyone noticed the unknown shadow in the video it was like around 16:02 behind the girl who is standing just check the window( idk I saw it so m writing the comment it might also be Colby'shadow)
Yall should do a video with @RageElixer
I wish for my 18th birthday, that I’d be able to go do something like this to actually experience it, because you can’t explain something’s that happen on video, but I don’t think anyone would do it with me, and honestly not looking to do it alone fr💀
i saw something once well i think i did i thought i saw legs in the dark issue was i saw nothing above the waist so i could been mistaken but i cant think what else it could have been
"Popcorn bags as a meassure of time" Such an american way... I'm surprised it wasnt in Burgers or something like that
MATE LOOK AT THE BACK WINDOW 16:02 it could be the light changing but that’s spooky
17:23 this is when it starts
16:00 possible shadow figure in the window. Watched the Undebunkable evidence sam and colby caught on camera video yesterday and it shows how many shadow figures and ghosts sam and colby actually capture and im not sure if they know about it because they dont highlight them in their videos. I feel like they probably do know about all or most of them at this point. I used to play phasmophobia a ton, extremely fun especially in vr. Though i have been enjoying a new more realistic ghost hunting game called Abnormality demo. Good luck fellow ghost hunters 👻 43:48 ghost orbs at the top right
Hi Guys!! This is a real stretch but i had an idea for you to try for your next paranormal investigation.   I’ve been watching this Netflix series called “Unsolved Mysteries” and in Volume 5, Episode 2, “My Paranormal Partner” there’s this guy that tests this spirit. Down below is how it goes.   1. Get one or more envelopes (Name them A, B, C, etc) and in those envelopes put in a picture (do this before you go to the said place of filming)  2. Use a recorder/ spirit box where you can hear the spirits try to communicate with you.   3. Ask the said spirit “Pick an envelope” (if you have multiple). Once they choose, if they do, then ask them “what is in the envelope” you can always alter the questioning.   4. The goal is to see whether or not they can see and guess correctly as to what is inside the envelope.   I believe that this would truly help people who aren’t believers or skeptics to believe   If you go to the episode that i am talking about you can have a better understanding!!
Do like Lazarbeam or the sidemen
She said her vibe rater was off😂😂
If you’re not ready for scary ish don’t go.
colbys walk at 30:00 LOL
You guys should take Jumpers jump 👏🏽😭
15:34 I had a an 'entity' haunt me that I called 'Lady in Blue' for least two years of my life and the mention of that spirit reminded me of that. Damn felt so uncanny.
So….there is a spider mating season which means that there are so many spiders around my house so you do not want to come at my house for now!😂
Can you put merch in Lebanese  stores like in Lebanon pls
16:01 SOMETHING RUNS BY THE WINDOW WHEN HE PANS THE CAMERA AROUND.
Sam and Colby. I just had a thought at 45:07 when the Alice Box said Michael, and with the guide at 11:41 telling you guys about the white light. I think what that light was, was the literal manifestation of the Archangel Michael. I believe it was Archangel Michael who was messing with your equipment, I think he was the one speaking to you, that's why the Alice Box said; "Michael". I think he was looking out for you guys since you guys did The Hosting Game wrong.  I could be wrong but I could also be right...
My name is pronounced “AL Ton” Mr.Sam😂
now bring noah on a episode (leslie a homewrecker)
It’s getting cold outside. I’m gonna have to cough up.
@pewdiepie
I live there 😂
mineral wells tx is pretty haunted stay at the hill house omg that’s so creepy that this town and mineral wells both have a history with mineral water and so called healing properties

I’m so mad that I didn’t know Alton was haunted when I was a teenager and living nearby 😭
you should call mrbeast for this
I LIVE NEAR ALTON
Y’all need to check out the Hotel Alex Johnson in Rapid City, SD.
theory what if pearl and George are "cursed" to be together as a slight punishment because upon her death he didn't care for her he just took the ring so upon dying, if so maybe pearl is keeping him there until he says sorry or explains why he did it
Colab idea: SMII7Y, Grizzly, blarg and puffer. Honestly would be funny as
The transition from crotch to ad was epic lol
when's the last time colby took a shower? the state of his hair is extremely concerning
Before i saw these videos I was never a believer, but when I found this channel i got jumped up sraight from one to ten.
One of my favorite videos. Their vibes completed this video. Bring them back 🔥
Around 15:50 to 16:01 there was a shadow walking across the window
These girls are annoying asf
#SamandColby  #StokesTwins #haunted
Sam and Colby should bring the stokes twin because they did a video on the conjuring house and don't think they believe in ghosts.
What the fuck like did anyone see those eyes on minutes 37:57 like bro the spirits were observing them
Am I tripping? At 24:13 I swear I hear something say hi or something like that…
26:29 "my vibrator is off"  the fu-
How did you manage to get sponsored by universal? I don’t create content so I don’t really know if that’s easy or not but damn.

Bébé
The ghost toggling the flashlight like "chug chug chug!!" LOL
How did bro get sponsored by universal😭😭😭luv Yall
Not Leslie turning around when Sam was talking about the camera 😭
I watched that movie with my friends at a birthday party (in the middle of the night) and it wasn’t scary… I might just be immune
markiplier on one of these episodes would be amazing and most likely very funny
Dear god dont let any spirts come through this video and into any of our homes for me and the rest of us amen 🙏

37:57  look in the doorway, to the right…
37:57 into the video you can see two sets of eyes
Coby sees demon😕 Coby sees spider 😭😬
I love 31:43 when Sam tries to say phasmophobia but fails love this video watched it like 24 times
SAM COLBY PLEASE DO A COLAB WITH THE BOYS!
They gotta go to Dudleytown, CT, now that’s literally the most haunted town in the US. They actually wouldn’t be able to legally enter because it’s blocked off from everyone, but it’s Sam and Colby, they’d figure it out 🤷‍♀️
Guys colby turned around on 41:45.... help
they didn’t finish the transition 😢😢
Purplecliff
I do NOT allow any negative energy or dark entries to stay or follow me or my loved ones. Thank you for letting us listen. Goodbye.
the way Colby had to teach Sam how to say phasmophobia shows how like Sam is the dad from 31:42 till 31:51
None of these females know anything
It be so cool if @markiplier could go with you to a haunted pizza place 😂
My favorite creator is Gavin! Please do a collab with him!
15 min from my house! Haha I was shook when they said “Alton” haha
Teen wolf? (Supernatural and banshee)
SAME AND COMBY X NICK WILLIKINS WE NEED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN🔥🔥
I love two hours away from it I am in Champaign Illinois I would be down to go after watching this
Fun fact: My mom was born in Des Plains Illinois and when she just a couple of months old her neighbor was John Wayne Gacy (idk if that’s how you spell it) before he became a serial killer
i claim no negative energy from watching this video
2:18 they just thirsty 😂
"Im a wooman-" *insert whispering*
Ur gay
Anyone else put Sam and coby on in the background to feel safe lol Its like u need their voices to feel safe like a comfort thing ❤
am i dumb or do i see two eyes looking at them at 37:57 if u look into the door on the right
Around 16 minutes a figure moves quickly past the window
@betasquad
People complain about being in a place where people have died, idk I grew up in a house folks died in and eh… stopped being scary cuz it was just home
bro at 24:45 when colby said “holy shit”
I love this group! We need more Rae and Leslie! 😌😌🫶🏼🫶🏼
25:13 is how I’d prefer to ghost hunt 😂
when the crash was heard i think it was more a big metal thing sound not a sh but a BANG like yk what i mean?
Colby Brock and Sam Golbach you guys are too funny! you guys make me laugh everyday😂
No way bro got sponsored by universal
why did i not realise that the potentially negative energies name was michael when the alice box said it D:  did no one else clock that?? they were asking if he was a sailor? 😭
YOu guys should do a video with Jaskihno
did u get n raes pants after all that that?
did the rock move at 55:57?
Rae!!!
is that like a figure of a person walking past the window? Like on the other side of the widow 16:01
“I feel shaky :(“ 50:11
,👍♥️🙏
No way they got universal so proud of you boys❤❤
Worst episodes are squealing girls the whole time. No wonder the views are so low on this one. PLEASE STOP WITH THE SQUEALING, OVERLY DRAMATIC, GIDDY WOMAN!! NOTHING GETS FIGURED OUT...AND MEN TOO, FOR THAT MATTER. A LITTLE DAMN RESPECT.
Look, the girls ruin the whole thing. Ffs.
He was definitely Pearl, and she was George. Watch it with that in mind, and I think every answer fits their lives.
15:52 look at the window hope that’s a shadow of them
Colby kept turning around when he shouldn’t have
at 34:37 , behind sam near the door there is some shadow figure peeking out no way everyone missed this
The girls are so beautiful!
..
Its my hometown :D So crazy!
49:37 Leslie: 👉👈
Lou is a good guy
My middle name is Tina 😨
16:02 in the window? Waaassss that a tree or what.

Hii
26:30 what did she say?!😂
THEY WERE IN ILLINOIS BRUHHHHH
Uce Gang from New Zealand
I really wanna do this with you guys so bad!
No way they did an ad for the haunted pool movie. That movie was laughably bad
There’s another good place in Illinois called Desoto house hotel in galena don’t know if you have down it already but there’s a lady in black who roams around the room scents of heavy perfume and cigars in peoples rooms I haven’t personally gone but my friend has she woke up to see the lady in black standing over her bed just watching her there are also reviews of other experiences on a website
I did not know I was a giant 7 foot figure man good to know I guess?
Yo that was pretty good vid funny but also interesting hopefully we see this collab again?
I love all the different kinds of guests that you guys have on this channel, but one guest I’d love to see you guys have is @BaileySarian ! I think she’d totally be into this kind of thing, and you guys would have so much fun.
42:22 i got scared when the thing said bracelet bc i just made one and i was playing around with it and then it said that...
TAKE KSIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Who's here in 2024 Watching it again
6:47  not me thinking about dead boy detectives why they say “Stone Tape Theory”

1:03:58 ong
51:50 here, no context
51:28 LMAO
40:02 *_b é b é_*
11:40 well that's just fucking made up.
Its so funny how Sam and Leslie grabbed eachothers arm at the same time
Every time I watch these videos I just feel so proud of you guys for how far you've come. Because I'm only a month younger than Sam and a month older than Colby 😂 😂 😂 Watching them grow since Vine has been an experience 😂 😂 I just wanted to say how proud I was of you guys
My nickname is Micheal (or as you spelled it, Michael) I'm a Psychic
Sam and colby taught us not to be scared of ghosts but bugs
In 55:56 what if Carol said "my cousin only kept Henry" like something is trying to explain some stuff- (ik I'm late)
One day I will go ghost hunting 😎
That’s so cool because I live 10 minutes away from hotel and my uncle got married there so if you ever go anywhere else go to the Mc.pike’s mansion
Please do a video with Jacksepticeye
u should get stromedy on a vid
You guys should visit helltown in Ohio
Yall should have me in a video lol
The most clearest video..
13:57 why did I laugh so much lol 😂
I've got to be honest: the two girls ruined this one for me. Too much joking and giggling. Seemed more of a date night than a ghost investigation.
Him zooming into his thing before starting the video is crazy it made me wheeze so hard😭😭
quick question at 40:32 😭 are the viewers allowed to turn bc oml i feel like i wanna put my hands to hold someones legs in a piggy back help im cryingg 😭
48:35 lmao guyssss 😭🙏
rae is such a sweetheart i cant
Can’t believe yall didn’t hit up the Lemp Mansion and Brewery while you were so close!!
39:53 there’s two shadow figures behind Sam
I like bosss baby back in crib
Hi Sam, hi Colby, my name is Fallon and I think you guys should go explore the Queen Mary, and I think I would be a good tagalong or you could bring Andrew Davila and Lexi Rivera with y’all because they did the queen. Mary and I actually stayed the night on that ship when I was little and there was a little girl who would talk to me while my parents were sleeping. She said she drowned and a second class pool and she wanted a friend.
My sister is a nun at the convent in Alton.
lol you guys should bring markiplier out to a location!
31:56 sam feels the demons and little girls up his ass that's what he feels
Anyone else saw a shadow in the window at 15:00
Leslie trying to be cute be like:
I see sam and colby I click
Carol, hi, cousin, only, kept, harry, i, Tina, heavy, were the words said when the girls went alone, its like its saying carols cousin only kept harry and they are talking to tina? Is that just me? The 2 other words idk
What happens if you turn around during the hosting game?
The spiders would make me dip
yall came to alton and i didnt hear ab it??????
Casidy, a kid who died during her birthday….. fnaf anyone?
56:30 @Post Malone
Wtf is zumies
22:10. There was something catlike that ran behind the girls
I live in alton
37:57 gave me a jump scare
This is just wholesome, no negative spirits
Why aren't they talking about when, in the estes, Colby said, "he stole it" talking about how her husband stole the ring 😱😱😱😱
At 41:50 Colby looked back when he was telling the "Spirits" To come down the stairs to speak with them what does that mean
40:04 I got her a little Bebe  Hello bebe shut up bebe
getting sponsored by fucking UNIVERSAL has to be an achievement lmao
I just added you can u add me back
I think colby was drunk. Lol
Thanks for coming out to Alton
*the girls having a panic attack by them selves* Sam and colby: Thanks to universal pictures and the girl are crushing it right now!
Valkyrae & Fuslie again for next video
13:28 Dew It
I’m gonna need to be taken on a ghost hunt
actual geekers
I think Pearl was speaking mostly through Colby then George through Rae because she didn’t say much like a husband that didn’t care. It would make sense since Colby said something about revenge.
I live in Illinoissssas😊
You should collab with Kelsi Davies I think you’d get along well!
Guys i saw a shadow go right behind valkyrae pls sam and colby go back wth valkyrae see if it happens again when yall were in perals room
Sometimes there videos aren't that scary put picture jumpscares they put in are a different type of scary😭
I was born in Alton........
37:58 in the door frame it looks like to eyes 😧😦
I just found you guys but I think Ldshadowlady and Smallishbeans would be so cool to see you guys with!
I LOVEEEE SAM AND COLBYYYT I WANNNANAN SEEEE THEMMM SOOOO BADDD
See they have cloths in the american stores like whatever zommis they should put thier merch in the most British place ever primark.

Are those eyes in the doorway at 37:56 ?
53:57 look closely down there kinda to the right but I think I see a man down there like a buff man idk it scared me😅

Leslie was was getting rizzy fr at 28:44
You should investigate the Kimo theater in albuquerque new mexico
I LOVE you guys! but honestly.. I really like it when it's just you two investigating. It's just more believable to me. 🤷
Good thing I live in canada
Hi
colby is a drunk
When i heard they say about "Michael" it reminded me of arc angle Michael and maybe he was the one protecting the guide, it just popped out of my head please don't hate me :)
26:29 Your WHAT?!?!
59:07 Sam: “does anyone wanna sit in the middle chair”.  Ghost: “shiiiiiit aight”
@samandcolby You guys should do a video with Addison Rae
So they just doing shots with ghosts now 25:18 😭😭😭
The popcorn talk was hilarious 😂
People watching this is 2024👇
matpat needs to do a side quest with them dude it would be so fucking good
The most haunted town in America…30 minutes away from me 😶✋🏽
Do stokes twins
at 43:32 both of the chairs moved
the amount of times colby turned around pissed me off 😭
If someone found a ghost thrn can you tell me the time
I would love to go on a hunt with you guys... I am just not creative enough to be a creator or someone influential...
I've been here before with family members!! They actually do ghost tours some times around the city of Alton! It's really sad and spooky learning some of the history!
So, i went here with my family in fall of 2022, and we had some insane encounters. the first one was when my mom, my brother and I went to the basement after the tour, and my brother was going to pick up a pair of dice, then my mom randomly screamed at him not to (very not like her) and went on to explain that she felt/heard something or someone saying not to pick the dice up. then, the tour guide did the estes method in the pool, my brothers chair was pulled back (down the slope of the pool) right after a cold breeze came though. after that, i was heading down stairs to get my brother because my mom needed him, and he was alone down there, i called out down the stairs 3 times before I began to go down to get him, before i could even take my second step, i heard a screaming voice say "NO! OUT!" as if it was in my head. and i felt 2 hands push me up the stairs. i ran back to my mom and felt sick for the rest of the night. all that, on top of my mom reading a book to a small child spirit in the attic. some other people that were there had a spirit box, which we spoke to the child ghost with, my mom is a teacher, so that's why we believe the child was more attracted to her. when she would finish reading the book, the spirit box would say "again". and it was crazy, my mom started crying at some point because she is very energy prone.  we also had alot of other encounters including some answers to yes or no questions using an EMF reader.   sorry if this was hard to understand, i just really wanted to share my story as this was my first and only haunted place ive been to myself. very cool to see Sam and Colby going there too
Some one died at my high school you guys should come investigate👀
I claim no negative energy from this video amen
Did anyone else see the shadow looking thing in the middle window at 16:00?? Or am I going crazy
Me and my family claim no negative energy from me watching this video
“7 foot man called William” “can u give us a name?, “micheal” AFTON FAMILY 😏
Did valk say vibrater?😂
The only YouTubers I’ve seen that are sponsored by universal pictures
the guild is actually the Ghost
Did not expect Sam & Colby to be in my hometown holy based
Nah for the matches not lighting, it was probably a new matchbox so needed to be struck a couple of times just to get it to work more conveniently.
"(casual flex?)" lmao
Please stop put the pictures
Im watching this from alton in the uk and yes the town is haunted it was a big battle site in the civil war between the round heads and the cavaliers from a hospital that was built for the crimean war to a hotel with a basement you dont want to be in of a night time to the legendary fanny adams. Maybe sam and colby should come and visit they can see were the last men of the cavaliers were surrounded and completely wiped out or walk the last steps of fanny adams or have a drink were mr baker the man who killed fanny adams was held he was one of the last men in the uk to be hanged. Theres loads of places round the town were you just dont want to be after dark not to mention the chavvy kids lol
I came here for Valkyrae and fuslie screams
Me and my family claim no negative energy from me watching this video
I think the xbox connect was interpreting the actual chair as a person sitting. The one that didn't have anything in it was a different shape and the "human" outline in the other two were perfectly lined up with the silhouette of the chairs.
I love how their casually drinking alcohol and then a couple videos later they say this is a family friendly channel 😂
26:30  Rae: my vibrator is off Me:😳😳😆😆
Lmao 11:59 “it knocked you up, and you felt it?”
37:58 what do y’all think was the white dot
What bro i live like 30 minutes away from alton and never knew it was haunted i go there a lot, i did feel uneasy in some places though
When Sam was saying what awaits them at the Slaughter house he was having so much fun scaring and explaining them, he felt awesome.
22:13 there was something behind you guys
Smash
MAN THAT DUAL ESTES METHOD WAS SO INSANE IN THIS VIDEO
Is that girl RebeccaZamolo
yk it would have been hilarious if y’all just knocked over the chair when you were tracking them there, and then they just fell over and starting walking towards you. 😭
26:30 - Did Rae just say her vibrator was off?
20:11 behind the Ray there's a shadow creeping by. When she's says "looks like this is where they pull your limbs apart".
When you said William I immediately thought of my dad 😂
mfs got sponsored by universal damn
1:05:12 they should’ve kept them in a bit longer
31:43 PASMOPOSIA 😭😭
Your awesome guys❤
It’s kinda funny how I’ve always loved the paranormal and oddities this world and lifetime have to offer. And it’s even funnier how I was born and raised in Alton 😂 the last thing I expected was to see a video come out where I grew up since (to my knowledge) it wasn’t all that well known 😅
We all know Sam and Colby were doing a 2 man mission
I wish the Xplr merch was a bit cheaper here in Canada. In this economy, paying $130 for a sweater is crazy in my opinion.
I live 2 mins away from  a haunted house
I love y’all’s videos I’ve been whatching yall since y’all started and I really want to explore with yall
Omg, I’ve been trying to find this video and I literally live there in alton
“Named William” Me: WILLIAM AFYON :0
80% of this is mob mentality if people tell you something and you wanna believe itll work itll work your mind is your most powerful organ
did anyone notice that Rae under the estes method mentioned needing a Will for help and at the beginning Sam and Colby mentioned the 7ft shadow by the pool was called William?
Yooo i lived near that townnn
Take me I am a ghost hunter
ZOZ  EvIL devmon evil
devmon evilll
EVIL🧛🏻‍♂️♈️😈🐐🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯✡️🕎📖📘
If you look at the window when they turn to the girls in 16:00  you can see like a shadow pass by behind that window it kinda looked like a tall man in a top hat or long arms
16:01 something at the Window, it gave me chils
I protect myself and anyone else watching this video from all bad energies, entities, intentions, and spirits. I welcome the good spirits and wish them peace.
Bro when the crash happened I herd one of then say '✨POOKIEE✨'             Like or else u get fanomtax 🤫🧏‍♀️
Is no one gonna talk about the eyes on the door frame to the right of them when they enter the pool room after they welcome the spirits? 😰😨😰😨😰😨😰😨😰😨
I wanna see Timthetatman on a ghost adventure
Ok , ok, yall wont belive me i have drank jack daniel when i was 10 and like this is how it happend- Ok i was eating pizza and my dad was drunk and he gave me a small cuo but he was smart enough to add 50% sprite . For those who havent had jack daniel it taste weird but idk im currently only 11❤
My freind has a crush on colby i dont like his hair no hate
Bring them back on.
Im scared of the dark and sometimes i see like veeeery detailed figures or even creatures, even at daylight. No Matter the place. For example I would take the bus and when I look out the window I would see a man, I know he isnt really there but I imagine him there very clearly. Is ist just my fear/creativity or does it mean something?
This was the first and only time I've seen, "Thank you to Universal Pictures for sponsoring this video". Bruh, whaaat..??? Hearing that was not on my bingo card for life and I still haven't seen another channel with that huge accomplishment 6mo later. lol Congrats on all your immensely well-deserved successes, boooyyyysss..!!
I live there
Stop the places they go to is interesting and the spirits but I'm mostly afraid of the images😭🙏
Stop the places they go to is interesting and the spirits but I'm mostly afraid of the images😭🙏
9:15 rock like the tall shadow man…
i want merch but i'm in Australia T^T
You should get microphones
Thats a cute spider
36:00 the ritual they did scares tf outta me!!! 😭
24:56  To show ypu that colby is all about ghost hunting and mess he took a drink and it already maxe him a lil drunk but then he was talking about ghost tools that shows how much hes into it😂😂😂
53:45 I was at the Mall of America and got confused bc I saw a picture of Sam in a zumiez and got confused bc I thought it wasnt Sam but when I realized I was like 'oh shit thats Sam', congrats guys!!!
Colby... what was that first transition bud? Also, Sam, Colby, Val, Leslie phasmophobia game when???
Carol's a legend
Can y’all do the gore orphanage in Ohio please
You guys please come back to illinois! And do the old joliet prison! Then I can be the first fan guest of sam and colby haunting!
Sam and colby: “ 7foot tall man named William” Me: William Afton ???😂
This  was scary
anytime any of the guest say they're skeptical or half way believe i think it's cause they haven't had an experience yet. Like i fully get were shes coming from i wasn't a believer either until i actually experienced something. but i would be freaking out like the girls too 🤣 especially being bait! SAVAGE AF lol
im sorry. UNIVERSAL PICTURES?
37:57 thers eyes in the door
is this a joke?
13:39 made me laugh bc colby’s voice changed when he was talking about the stairs😂😂
This year what about sniperwolf
Anyone else called Cassie and feeling unsettled? o_o
Chester
46:31  When one of the spirits said “shadows” I got chills and immediately thought of William (the 7 foot shadow spirit)
https://youtube.com/shorts/SkI6SpyzQPE?si=Lo61DrDwsGI2f2Ib
You guys should come to New Zealand! 🇳🇿 ❤
"Seven foot tall figure man" "Named William"  Me: The man behind the slaughter? 👁👄👁   Edit: Time stamp - 8:30
My name is pearl 😭😭😭
you should make a vid of all the tools you use
16:01 ghost in window???
Lowkey I wanna see ssSniperwolf do one of these with you guys
During the Estes method the “He stole it” from Colby might have been pearl talking about when Gorge took the ring after she died
I didnt think universal would sponsor you guys
if i become a ghost, i'm gonna go to haunted locations like this and just fuck with the paranormal investigators
48:01 - 49:40 this part was so chaotic I was dying laughing, legit my lil bro could hear me in his room
1:04:34 I love how sam and Leslie kept on holding each other
Go to the Lizzie Borden House!!!! Find out the mystery there!
❤
Love u Sam and Colby
Got a Bebe had me rolling 😂😂😂
The very first video I watched on this channel Was when Colby and his friend calling scary numbers
2 man 😂😂
sam and cloby i love your videos
BRING CASEOH AND JYNXI
I have a friend named William...   he's 4'11 though 😂😂😂
Me when it said carol.-“it’s carolinee
So at 12:22 to 12:30 when the guide is talking about the orb u can here somethin fall in the background. It's very fair but u can still here it
No offence but how did they get universal pictures to sponser them
@Markiplier you would be great for this.
"Thank you Universal Pictures for  sponsoring this video." *spits out tea*
You know you’ve made it when you get sponsored by UNIVERSAL FUCKING PICTURES
1+1 = we live in option B
16:01 there is a shadow on that yellow covered window but it could be a tree blowing on it (they are on top floor btw)
collaboration with jake and johhnie
THE MOST WEIRDEST THING IS AT 58 MINS! IT SAYS THE PEARL SONS ROOM AND MY REAL NAME IS PEARL!!!!!!!!
i love watching ur vids no matter how many times i rewatch them!!!
I don’t know if I’m wrong but if you go to the time 16:00 in the video you see something passing by the middle window 🧐
1:03:59 “on god” 😂
Look up Sloss furnace in Birmingham Alabama it could honestly be a good spot that y’all can go to for a video
Pls gooooo back to Samantha and Colleen plsssssssssss❤
i love coming back to watch this video because I grew up in alton and it's nice seeing other people learn about it
DisguisedToast next ?
this is js me but it genuinely pissed me off how the 2 girls were freaking tf out and messing up the ritual 😭 no hate to the girls they seem like the sweetest humans ever but if it were me i wouldn’t have signed up if i knew i couldn’t handle it
56:26 I do I have the gutssssss
i saw night swim, it was actually rlly good
I do not allow any negative energy or dark entities to stay and follow me or my loved ones thank you for sharing you’re stories
Illinois mentioned
You gotta stop putting background noise when there’s a noise defeates the purpose of us being able to listen to some shi
Sam and Colby I really want to go ghost hunting, I am only 13 but I love you guys and want to go ghost hunting!
Lol polo
The whole flashlight thing u o sometimes there tricky
Lesie: "what's the name of the scary guy who throws rocks at people??" Colby: "MICKEY!"
is it js me, or have they not released all the conjuring videos?
@Slogo go
nothing from this spirit can harm the viewer reading this through this video! God will protect them and their family friends, etc. the spirits are not allowed to haunt them from this film, amen
Just passed along to the other side
In the vid there is a figure in the window
Hi around 16 min
8:38  *gasp* William afton?!
“Absolutely NOT”
Anyone know if the do not turn back whatever ritual was done wrong
omg take me PLEASE!!! I'm in California and would love to meet y'all and do spooky things!!!!!
The camera was violated by Colby 😱😭
Haunted pool(first time))????!??! Queen marry hello??
17:47 figure in the background
Pov: your from Alton and you know exactly what shop they are in at the beginning of the video
I’m too scared
i kept going back to this video just for the lighting the match part.. hahaha sorry but the reactions are in sync
didnt cloby look behind him
I’d like to imagine the ghost is in the corner like shot shot shot shot shot shot shot shot shot shot shot everybody
I haven’t finished the video yet, but so far you have not mentioned anything about Al capone probably the most famous hotel guest they ever had
The transition to his pants😂
Not me every five minutes when Sam and colby put a black screen 📺 I make a scary face 😂😂
Mr beast should collab with Sam and colby
Carols cousin only kept harry tina heavy friend
16:00  What was that?
The fact that I live in il
I kinda wanna see Jessica and Jason make an appearance.
حرام تحط صورة بنت
You guys should go back to the Stanley hotel!!!!!!!
I don’t know if it was just me but at 11:39 - 11-53 it looks like a shadow figure in the pool behind the guide
Not gonna lie I love yall but stop making videos with ppl who make em annoying they wouldn’t stfu. It’s annoying any little thing they wanna act scared & do to much  it’s annoying.
9:40 OMG ITS WILLIAM AFTON
For a joke, they should invite the Youtubers Ssundee and Crainer lol--I would die 😅
L guest imo not fun to explore with, shit episode, maybe go solo? without  guest?
whos here in june
im a big fan and btw i have ghost in my house :)
The movie night swim came out in theatre's was on my birthday
Kmk and Celina. Yall need to take them again
Leslie scaring herself in the beginning is definitely a Leslie thing😭 love to see two of the roomies!!
I was dying when they just started drinking with the ghost cheering them on with it's little flashlight 😂💀💀
New drinking game:take a shot everytime a spirit turns on a flashlight
41:50 colby turned around 😮😮
24:49 Colby was rocked after that shot
I uhm, I'm from Illinois.. I MUST CHECK THIS OUT!!!
I feel so bad for them
ofc the movie came out on my birthday so we went and watched it the fist time it came out since it was on my birthday
why did i start felling somthing on my back and scratching my neck for an hour
Can we pause for a sec to realize they were sponsored by one of the biggest studios of all time?
Guys I thought someone would see this omg, a couple seconds before 37.59 there's glowing eyes in the big hallway I had to rewatch to see if it was actually there😮
I just noticed that when someone's scared, they don't hesitate to go to Colby's back/side, every freaking videos. Anyway, I just find it cute!
So are we not gonna talk about the eyes at 37:57 in the door way
I remember old Rae and her Fortnite days 🥲
i do not allow any daemons spirits entities or negative energy to come and haunt/follow me my family friends and loved ones amen
Do they know who gacy was? Cause they said he dressed up as a clown and killed little kids. Which is just untrue being a clown was just his side gig
The fact that Colby turned his neck around to look behind him at 42:16
24:18 is when I paused the video cause my ear started ringing.. after hearing the name Luo Harwood(idk if that’s how u spell it, also this is edited, I put the wrong number)
Please get typical gamer to do this stuff with you guys
Legends say that a ghost is in Sedona hotel in Yangon myanmar
26:30 her what is off😳😂
“Dere so cute and liddle 🐭🤏” - Colby Brock 51:32
58:08 Stanley hotel, Sallie house, Sam walking in just when “friend” is said gives the impression it never left
Did no one heard the voice at between like 6:25 6:27 is it the girls or is it something else 😭
“Am I like…actually gonna throw up?” “I mean I have but like” “you might like…dry heave” “yea dry heave” video: “👹👹👹”
@sidemen should come on
22:08 was I the only one who thought the car was a shadow figure🥲
mr nightmare!! @Mrnightmare favorite scary content creator
I wish they would have Simon Whistler join them on a hunt. I think it would be funny as hell to have factboy scared out of his mind 😂
At 41:48 Colby turned around...
Getting sponsored by one of the most popular studios is genuinely amazing.
Can you take Rebeca zamolo 13:33
I would want to be dead so that Sam and Colby could come investigate me. ❤❤❤
Do more videos with them
I love how sam and Leslie just holding and grabbing each others arms while colby and Rae were having a 1 on 1 argument. Literally love what yall r doing. Im probably making a ship now who knows?🤷‍♀️
☠️ 1:46
46:25 ahhhhh, guys, I think I put it together. You might have been talking to Michael as in the Archangel Michael.
this is probably sound stupid but did they say Michael on purpose because of the party in the pool or was that for real??!?
I find your videos interesting. You guys should do a Collaboration with (Brittney Crabbs)
If they see shit they're just wasted.........
In 16:01 I saw a shadow in the window😭
I think there was a Shadow figure in the window. 00:16:01
Okay I noticed this but when they were in pearls room and the thing said he stole it I thought of when George asked for them to take pearls ring off so I think pearl was saying he stole the ring but that's just my theory and I don't know if they mentioned it because I immediately kinda stopped the vid to type this but if anyone can confirm I'd be happy if you did
Omg i wanna see @Jollztv doing something like that with you!!!
Great video😂😂🙏🏼🙏🏼
Please please please please please‼️‼️‼️ do a investigation with   Kelsi Davies‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
is it js me or did i quite literally play the hosting game with them while watching (i didnt turn around/look behind me)
I do NOT allow any negative energy or dark entites to stay or follow me or my loved ones, thanks Sam and Colby for thier work.
at 41:49 he turned twice
26:32 RAE SAID WHATTT
flashlights are debunked
you guys are the hottest thing in ghost hunting for the 2020s
14:22 " I'm a Woman" by sam got me fucking dead laughing
"the most offensive language you've ever heard"  What the people on the tour heard: *THUD*  YOU MOTHERFU-
You can´t tell me they don´t enjoy scaring the girls even more lol Love this combination tho, I love when guests are talkative and participate a lot
I feel like Pearl wants her ring back for sure
"Its not Funneh" 21:08
POV ur watching this and your name is Leslie and you thought someone was calling your name because your tv is at full volume 😂❤
Sam and Colby I really love your guys'videos. I really enjoy watching your videos.. Keep up the good work guys.
You should collab with hypemyke and the groups😊.
lady in blue VS lady in red🤡✌️
So if a ghost can touch you, could it touch you "down there" amd how long would it keep at it?
@baylenLevine i need to see this plssss Sam and Colby don't skip this
not the Moorman ad lmao
I accidentally skip to the end  Colby: Son of a b!tch
Omg this was amazing vid you guys should Collab with Markiplier
@vivziepop needs to ghost hunt with y’all!
i really appreciate the tour guide kinda offering debunking blurbs here and there. it was refreshing to see him talking about spooky stuff and not immediately jump into "who knows, maybe it is the ghosts!! ooooOOOoooOoo!" ya know?
Pls invite them both again ! ❤🥹
I want to see @hasanabi on a ghost hunt
@TheGrumps need to ghost hunt with you guys 😂 Arin has said he wants a reason to believe. It'd be a fun and spoopy watch
Not to be weird but I hope they are protecting themselves cuz of all this bad energy and entities
Little nitpick here at like 20 min in y’all mention John Wayne Gacy. He never actually killed in his clown costume. That was a character he made for kids parties to make people think he was a kind man. He actually pretended to be a cop to manipulate men into doing sexual acts to get out of tickets. He also used other tactics into manipulating people into doing what he wanted. He buried most of them in his yard and under the house. He threw a few into the nearby river. Little serial killer lesson for ya
YALL SHOULD DO MOIST CRITICAL
Bro i dont think you can point the camera behind you
Ayy its rae and leslie!!!
i just watched the night swim movie i didn't think that was related to this video...
i live there
The guy who told them the stories at first was so polite
I was here not to long ago it's like 40 minutes from St Louis do so we stayed here and stuff so we could visit the arch it's a pretty cool town
If anyone is seeing this my brother does twitch and plays with some of his friends and only get 1 or 2 people watching and if you see this can you raid him is name is isaamatthew please support him he does a lot for us and the best brother thank you you see him Thanks.
y'all should collab with Kai Cenat
COLAB WITH GROOVY GAVIN
Rae: *Y’all we shouldn’t say its name. Is it a demon??*  Colby: *ASHAAAAAAAA*
You were 50 mins away from me. I’m pissed I wish I could have met you guys.
Ngl when colby and val were doing the estes method suddenly my right ear started heating for no reason,and i hear like radio sounds
I swear to god when they were lighting the matches I felt something touch my feet
"My vibrator is off" 💀😭🙏🏾
sam and colby can you guys put all the staying a week at the conguring house in one video pls
Colby: "Michael...maybe he's the guy who drove the boat." My brain: "Michael, row the boat ashore, hallelujah!" 🎶🎵🎼🎶🎵🎼
i want Dream to participate in this 😂
"I feel like most hotels don't have people die in them." "But,what if they do?" Answer: they do. They all do. It's sad, but true. Hotels & motels are the final bodily destination for many, many people.
YOU SHOULD BRING BACK LEXI HENDSER
16:00 look at the window 💀💀 So scaryyyyyyyyy😂😂 the shadows
𝕀𝕟 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕓𝕝𝕒𝕔𝕜 ℍ𝕒𝕝𝕝 𝕨𝕒𝕪
Rae you look like my best friend 😊
56:24 petition to have LaurenZside on an investigation
Dude these American’s don’t know what a bug spider is until they go to Australia
Pasmophobia means fear of ghosts
Caseoh
Do you guys relize when Sam said that is where 5 of their phones were siting when there is only 4 people lol
Me who came from a TikTok edit 😮
I love that Colby intimated spirits while Sam has one up his but 24/7
guests 👎🏻
I like how some of the videos make me nervous but they some how help me feel better
16:02 did something jump over the window like in a cartoonish thing or just the light from outside
As an avid Phasmophobia player, I always wondered if Sam and Colby would ever get a couple of Phasmophobia players to join them. Really enjoyed this one!
I need you to bring Grian, Scar, Skizz, and Impulse ghost hunting because I have to see hoe they'd react especially because they're the phasmophobia krew
Im cool with lou😂
The way she said ,it was just the limestone 9:21
You should do a video with Albert flamingo
These vids are so good
why not  try @pewdiepie
Colby is so funny like when he said bébé 😂
Omg I live only 45 min away from Alton. It’s SO cool to see you guys investigating smaller towns in near Illinois/Missouri. I’ve heard things growing up near here but you guys taught me even more in this video!
its so crazy to think how close the chemical compounds of limestone and bones are so very similar.
Girls are so fun😂 Thank you guys for a new amazing video!
My husband and I love watching Sam and Colby ❤ my husband loves the paranormal he also does his on investigation and has had a lot of WOW 🤯 so awesome. Just wanted to let you both know we have been watching all of your videos since this year 2024. My daughter has been watching you both from your first video I believe at 15 years old ❤ she is the one who got us hooked 😂 she loves you guys!!! Now so do we. Keep up the great work.
@Zars
I live in Illinois  : )
Someone see the shadow in the window in the moment 16:00
"whos john Gacy"..... Excuse me???!!!
Wow the 4 of you together are perfect. Like “couple” perfect. Hahaha you all need to have them both back on more videos for sure.
everything is temporary 😂😂😂😂😂😂 SAM SAYING HELLO?
hi sam and colby i really like you both. i am your big fan pls reply me
24:45 the spirit was rizzing up the girls bro even spirits got more rizz than Sam and colby
I love that Sam and Colby are feeling sick but they put their guests first Sam and Colby deserve to be treated so kindly
1:13 Did bro just say gay.  EVEN WORSE BRO 💀💀💀 26:30
41:22 there are only four people so why are there five phones?
I wanna see Jeannie and Henry from MxR Plays on an investigation with you.
Take Nick Hughes with you that's zowpkli
Bro the funny thing is a few years ago I always used to go here for my birthday-and i made kids cry one time because I told them it was haunted-
Not me getting a brawl stars add after they said I’ll be ready soon
I would feel like it would be funny to have Kwite go on one of these lol
Please go back to the conjuring house
I am a huge fan
What happend2 the haunted town in Wisconsin? They ahould go there2.
26:30 Rae whatchu mean by that?! LOL
40:4  GOT  A LITTKE BEBE (COLBY-2023-24)
34:10 and a few other moments when the "listen..." prompts appear on screen... "What was that?" Dunno, all I could hear was musical stings.
Next will you go to Jerome, Arizona?
Go to the clown motel 😮
When sam said im a woman i thought about samantha and if you know ,you know
y'all should take garret watts on an adventure. that bitch is crazy
No maybe with the Michael thing and the tour guide thinking it was an angel maybe they’re talking about Michael from the Bible?
16:00, there’s something behind the girl that moved in the window— It might be me, but I’m just pointing it out just in case.
BRO Colby looked more scared than the girls😂😂😂😂😂
Should sam and colby try a ghost hunting game?
It's weird to think that this is only 30 minutes away from me
36:53 Sam's face when the match lit
What the hhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllll did they just get their self into?😂
1:03:01 didnt the guy say he stole her ring?
Its archangel michael it was good he was protecting you guys too 🎉and he protected the  guide aswell with the blue light 🎉
Pls do in Dallas Texas there a hotel in downtown that’s needs to be figure out !
I have never heard someone tell time in popcorn bags 😂
Loey lane
14:23   did sam just i am a woman 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Okay so at 35:40 those matches suck anyway i have a pair and they NEVER light up and its annoying.. you have to put like a lot ofm umph into it. or it could just be my box and it sucks but i think thats the problem there for them
24:42 "Cheers to the spirits!"  "Yeah, cheers to me!! :D"
Compared to everyone else's voices, I feel like Sam's voice is very nice to hear during the Estes Method when he's asking questions, but when they need to remind evil entities to not follow them home, he is very commanding and stern. Overall, Sam's presence is just comforting to me overall-
At 34:21 did anyone else see that hand pulling that door shut or was it just me?
Love the vids thanks for doing what you can to give us entertainment.
Are we not gonna talk about the shadow at 16:03?? Behind the plastic in the window?????? 🥲
I volunteer please to be on a scary  hunting videos @samandcolby
i think itd be funny if Flamingo/Albert went on one of these vids
"I've never been somewhere where so many people have died"  my mind : But have you been to a hospital?  I'm so sorry I just had to get this thought out
Look at 16:00 there is a ghost or sport flying tin the window
thos to girls know Corpse_Husbend they are his friends
3:43 superman core
it's been very weird and I've been hearing things in my house and detecting A LOT of ghosts in my house (using the SLS camera app) and my EMF was going insane, i think my house in haunted.
wait can you guys collab with @kelsiidaviess
Ests method is the best
Watching Sam and Colby At Day: 😃😊 Watching Sam and Colby At Night: 👻👹💀💀
umm my necklace just shift on god and i swear in my dads soul fuck that
i love how Sam and Colby aren’t scared of ghosts and deal with demons like champs but living animals freak them out every time
Hey
If demons can come threw why can’t angels
Hey Sam Colby enjoying your adventure in the video I heard one of the girls say mikeal my first reaction was the archangel as the owner said a bright orb saved him and a group from a falling wall what’s your thoughts
I love your videos I just subscribed cause I usually watch y’all on my other phone not my iPhone💀
Fun fact, both horses and cows kill more people yearly than sharks. I think it is around 7 for sharks 20 for horses and 22 for cows.
1:45 …
I'm  horrified... Colby turned his head 2 times on the pool
Its all abt tik tok, real ones are the ones that remember when colby got pranked in the pool
I have finished the video and this is my 2 time watching it
l seen a ghost  in the yellow thing and seen a shadow
THIS COMMENT IS RARE! WHO IS HERE IN MAY 31st 2024! Someone comment exactly this day
YALL SHOULD DO A COLLAB WITH THE HA SISTERS
@samandcolby it's Phasmophobia
56:25 Hmm. You know.. Since he loves playing a bunch of obscure indie horror/ghost-hunting games (and screaming while playing them), I'd love to see IGP in one of these.
I like this episode. Ive been laughing! 🫰🏻
would love to see any smosh cast member on the channel-  i feel like damien would be so down.
37:57 eyes in the door to left
😂 women can feel sad   Sam: I'm a Woman 😂😂
Did they actually mess up that ritual they did? Idk about anything supernatural but its really interesting to me and id like to know.
I've done a lot of research on labotamies and they (around the 1950s) they would take a metal rod and go through your eye lid and stad the emotion part of your brain, which is called the limbic system, to make you emotionless. This was most practiced on women due to the husband.
hey. i know this is crazy, but my house is seriously haunted. my grandpa died in this house so has two other people in the long long past. they are messing with my nieces and nephews. and my little girl. we had the house blessed multiple times but nothing seems to work. someone lmk what to do! thank you!
At exactly 16:00 you can see a shadow moving in the window in the background while nobody moved
@D’Aydrian Harding should trie this with y’all, that would be such a movie!
man i wish i could go on one of these ive never had paranormal experiences myself but ive always believed in spirits and stuff through watching you guys and with my religious beliefs
I’m not scared of lions tigers and bears oh my but……..                 I’m scared of the pictures they put in there videos😅😂
Bro the movie “Night Swim” wasn’t as scary as this. This video was more scary and crazy
48:58 is literally the funniest sh*t ever 😂
If you go to 15:58 You can see Something.
I can't tell if it's a trick of the light but it looks like something moves behind the plastic in the window at 15:59 to 16:02.
What I think will be a good collaboration is Sam and Colby and CORYXKENSHIN .
When they introduced Leslie and Rae I just thought about how my mom's name is. Leslie and mine is Raegan
Leslie & Rae are adorable! Still love you guys with Celina & Kris though! ❤
When’s the abandoned series coming back
I think it’s amazing  that Leslie wanted to call the spirits by their official titles, that amazing
I think Val didn't get much during the Estes method because Leslie was moving around while holding on to her and it was taking her out of the trans.
definetely crushing on rae atm i must admit
what's really annoying to me is that they over shout a lot i mean i know they are encountering something but they should be more like quiet in order to let us listen the footsteps the approaches and all that that's just my opinion
Man I went to one and a shirt was like 100$ Canadian and I love you guys but I can’t buy a shirt for 100$
Colby broke the no looking back rule a few times

Colby turned over his shoulder in the pool when pointing out the marbles are on the stairs for cassie
1:00:49 behind sam in the door way during the light up

Yk who yall should do sssniperwolf anywhere yall want
I started watching your content a week ago and its been fun! also I saw some movement in the window at 16:01 maybe its Pearl?
God protect me and my loved ones and nothing is allowed to follow me from these videos
What the hell 7:23
my names william tfff
Will could be Pearl doctors name? or maybe not.
at 55:55 YOU CAN SEE A GIRL IN A DRESS IN THE SHADOWS
i wish school history class was like same and colbys little backround checks on these places lmao
Wait why William kinda-🤭
How the HELL did they score a sponsor with UNIVERSAL!!!
I never know if they are playing a sound effect or if it’s an actual noise 9:08
I live like 30 mins away from there
Dear, Sam x Colby There is a indian youtuber named triggered insaan he does not belive in ghosts so i want u to take him on a horror adventure
I'm not sure if it was because of the effects or filter or something but is it just me or was there something in between Colby and Rae in the last photo.
THE BOYS COLAB AGAIN PLSSS ITS SO MUCH FUN TO SEE U GUYS DO GHOST HUNTING!
always when i watch sam and colby haunted videos i always feel like something is stuck to my back, but when i take my bible from my shelf it goes away just like if it knew the bible was too powerful. i also remember that when i was little i remember seeing tall figures in doorways and outside the windows, sometimes i saw eyes in the dark or under our dinner table.
mr beast
the amount of spirits ive seen dash through doorways in this video is insane and ive only at 3/4 of the way done with it
Sam's tongue skills?
Wait at like 41:40 did Colby turn around when he wasn’t supposed to???
For three months in 2016 I stayed at a cousins house that was behind the abandoned school, almost every night I could hear the cries of children that had passed in the basement of the school, it was an experience I'll never forget
#PourOneForLou
yall should go to the town square in Gallatin Tennessee. It’s supposedly very haunted due to being an area where a ton of slaves being lined up and killed along the streets. (I have personally experienced some paranormal activity there.)
26:28 VALKEYRAE WHAT??
Did none see the girls shadow when you flashed the light it was at the corner
Fgsh
you need arachnophobia trigger warnings FR blur that shit !!!!!
Who wasn't afraid of night swimming in a pool after watching jaws?😅 I was always afraid something was going to bite my legs off or drag me under😅😅😅
Super wild seeing my hometown in anything on youtube. Next time ya’ll are around check out the mass memorial for the war, the manor if its still standing or the old prison ruins.
This one scared me with the whole can’t turn around thing
win i wus woching  the power eit out!!
13:39 Colby after the stairs lol
Man im roughly mady aggressively PROUD of the sponsors you guys getting i mean WHAT?? Universal?? Unifuckingversal? Im proud of you my boys😫❤
Willam afton
night swim I love that movie I’m scared to go swimming now!!
The way on the tour when thy got to pearls room and the guide was like "most women will feel sad" and them sam goes "I'm a woman" I couldn't stop laughing
there on insane difficulty '' OH NO ITS HUNTING'' XDDDDDD
37:57 da heck is that
Valkyrae is so adorable
I grew up in Alton and my family has some crazy stories. My dad worked at the old haunted theater
What does one have to do to get an invite? I’m on socials but no where near what you would consider qualified maybe but I am a huge fan. I’ve consistently watched every episode you two have done and have added going on a ghost haunt with you both on my bucket list.♥️ this would be epic. I also have experience with ghosts and have always felt like I can feel when one has walked by or through me. Never see but can feel. Please please please make do a draw for us fans who are daring to go and make a sign up where you draw out a name and offer then to go on a haunting with you.🫶🏽
I watch yalls videos when I'm constipated bc it scares the shit outta me 🖐🏻😭.  💀💀💀
The girls: freaking out  Sam and Colby: promoting their merch
15:59 it looks like something moves in the window behind Leslie?
U should see if u could rent a room during the Summer, when the club is closed, @ The Sulgrave Club in Washington, D.C.  It is DEFINITELY haunted, I use to work there and u could hear people in the dining room talking and eating, when it was closed for the evening.  I use to be one of the people that would do an 8 hr shift during the morning, from 7-3, there wasn’t anyone there so we could take a nap, as long as we answered the cordless phone.  During one of my naps I had to pee, so I woke up, but there was a lady holding me down, so I pretended to still be asleep until she let me go, than I ran right out of the front door. 🤣. Made my friend come sit with me the rest of my shift or I was going to quit.  I think spirits were drawn to me.  Had more than one story like The Sulgrave Club.
OML YES VALKYRAE AND FUSLIE knowing valkyrae she would be scared shitless half the time
One of the clips shows a window that has a hand just waving
What I would give to go exploring with Sam and Colby. Even if I had to do something alone lol. Been watching these guys vine. Maybe one day I will get to! I do have a entity attached to me. So I'd love to learn more about my attachment
pls stop using the flashlight. lol
I do NOT allow any negative energy or dark entites to stay or follow me or my loved ones, thanks Sam and Colby for thier work.
At 30:52 you can see a pair of eyes in the back room that’s all black
37:58 are those eyes that im seeing or am i tripping
41:37 colby’s iconic stance
People find y’all through TikTok? I had no idea like actually 😭
Hey caroll🤓🤪
COLBY IS THE FUNNIEST 😂
I heard a hey when they were alone in the dressing room
Am i the only one who whenever i watch sam and colby(or any real paranormal or horro movie stuff) something weird happens at my house, like as soon as i started this video not even 10 minutes in there was a huge bang and as im typing(not done watching the vid)rn my tap just opens also it's like 3 in the morning best time to watch spooky sh*t😂  P.S. I LOVE SAM AND COLBY'S CHANNEL AND ALL PARANORMAL AND HORRO STUFF ❤❤❤🤩🤩🤩
1:00:00 i feel like they should have swapped chairs around, the one without a figure was the odd one out, it had a different backrest. That seemed to throw off the kinect as the larger backrest might be considered as an upper body.
GO TO THE MOST HAUNTED PLACE IN THE INTIYER WORLD
WTF IM RIGHT ACROSS FROM THERE RN, IT WAS FOR MY COUSIN’S GRADUATION, IT SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 6 MINUTE WALK OVER THERE?!
Krew
When bro said William MY MIND SAID”WILLIAM AFTON”😂

❤❤❤
The part where Meagan is dancing had me rolling in my bed 😂😂
They shut down MS for good this past weekend!!!! Weddings and events were canceled. New owner. No more investigations, very sad.
Would be cool to see Rae and Fuslie do a haunt with Amanda the median.

DID ANYONE SEE THE EYES IN THE RIGHT DOORWAY AT 37:57??? That shit is so scary
I loveeee it when you guys do the dual estes method! When you did it in the conjuring house it was sooo good! Keep the dual estes comingggg
7:36 he should have mentioned the pyramids at Giza are limestone and are built on a natural ley line.
Love these girls, so cute n funny
Would you win against evil spirits  Me as: nah I'd win 😎
If lime stone conducts paranormal activities wouldn’t the pyramids be haunted, can they go an investigation in a pyramid?

At 56:05 was that a rock hitting the ground or rae's flashlight?
Didd colby turn over his shoulder when they were inviting cassie to play with the marbles on the stairs?
Not probably going to get seen but a Sam and Colby team up with Sidemen over in England or Scotland would be lit
Not the memorabilia 😂
Guide: everyone that come her think that these are to hang pig  Colby: yeah idiot 🙄   *colby five second before saying that these where for the pig and imitating how they look 😂*   5:27

They are too loud for me
I LOVE THESE GIRLS ESPECIALLY REA
@Fuslie is the prettiest of them all 😍😍
Not to be like that but valkyrae looks like my philosophy teacher
i live so close to alton and have been there myself!! you guys need to come to Lebanon
40:02 look behind Colby in the darkness, something came forward then backed away. it is skin colored. I can't tell what it is but it doesn't look natural.
Idk why but those girls are way to enthusiastic for me 😮‍💨😒

I have just watched this video and the fact my name is Michael and my birthday is in November was the weirdest coincidence I've had watching one of sam and Colby videos
the fact that my name is cassie- '-' it's kinda cool meeting another cassie lol
When colby said „if you think jaws made you afraid of the ocean”in my head I was like nah jojo siwa made me afraid of the ocean bc of her new music video
That was just super scary mate! My favourite part was when George And Pearl were having an argument 😂  But I feel so sorry for them at the same time cuz they are trapped in there with their past lives and they are still going through it 😢 God Dayum man 😕
Bro wtf I live there since when

Gen z girls love just hearing their own voice and tell you everything that pops in their head
I know where you should go crybaby bridge
Rae looks like Jenna Ortega
I think I saw shadows through one of the rooms when he was talking about like this girl that called the blue woman
26:30 Your what? Was off Rae?

Leslie 🤝 Lou
Rae-"Dont say his name. Do you think its a demon?" Colby-"ahsasaaaassaaaa"

SKIBIDI TOILET
I seen night swim already
Carol and harry are relatives of either Leslie or Rae, I can feel it.
Imagine if bretman rock and bella poarch would appear in their future videos
There was a shadow moving in the window at pearls room 16:18
I know it's just in my head but Sam and Rae would've looked good together
I don’t know if any of yall saw this but go look back to 37:58 there it glowing eyes
I want to see digital and SSSniperwolf or kiy centan ?
Thats tall shadow man reminds me of the midnight man. Kinda where all this started
39:04 She turned?!
Video game objective : protect the girls
52:04 outline
Bro I'm going swimming tomorrow......🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
You should do a video with Tara yummy
Did anyone else see the orb pass in front of the black door behind Rae and Leslie at 24:44 ????
Him*
If not them then try colliding with The Dolan Twins
You should try taking a YouTuber named Vanossgaming
I wish they brought someone who could help whatever is stuck in this realm move on or remove the curses. Sometimes I feel like the spirits are so sad.
drinking games with a ghost is a crazy idea, I like it
I love how Sam and Colby do this stuff all the time and they are still surprised when they hear something or one of the machines go off😂😂❤
Leslie and rae brung alot of positivity to this video
I'm late but one out of the couple said they were cursed and if I recall the guide had said that when the wife died the husband just came and took the ring and showed no concern for his dead wife. I had a situation like that in my family and when the wife died her husband came hounding for the ring to the point where he fought her family for it. Came to find out he worked some dirty shit on the ring and needed to get it back after she died so that whatever curse he put on it wouldn't turn back on him. The whole story with the abuse and then the ring and the way the husband behaved just lines up so well with that story from my family.
@eddievr
Hi
I LIVE IN ALTON
Did anyone else see the two glowing eyes
Did anyone else see the two glowing eyes
WHO LOVES SAM AND COLBY ( Not forcing and not a like beggar )
I don't allow or claim any negative energy, spirits, entities or anything else to come around me or my loved ones while watching this video,thank you for letting us hear your story, I'm apologise if I made any glances at anything that I shouldn't have, you deserve the upmost respect.🕉️✝️
Kelsi Davies. Yall should do a whole series with her. I'd love that
Leslie is so cute! She should really join your team permanently lol.
You guys are awesome, but it is mad difficult to take you seriously. Your videos seems like just a huge joke purely for entertainment rather than a serious investigation. Professionalism goes a long way in giving credence to your vids. Drinking alcohol is totally irresponsible. And I seriously don't like the random shots you insert. Given your popularity I am obviously in the minority. That said, I am hooked on when you capture real, visible paranormal activity...which is pretty amazing but more amazing is that you get any at all. If I were a ghost I would definitely be later dudes to all of your joking around.
I'm a total believer, but it is so hard to take you and your videos seriously when you treat it like some big joke. So much disrespect of both the entities and of those who take investigations like this seriously. Your emphasis seems to be on entertainment, not discovery. I think you guys are awesome, but you make it hard sometimes. Just sayin'...
I do not allow any spirits entities or energies to cause any harm to me or my family.
you can't turn around colby as soon as the investigation starts 41:50
Id die to see @Ldshadowlady do a ghost hunt with you guys
Can you bring Preston tbnr frags
The guide was super creepy imo
16:00 there is a shadow in the window 😮
Michael from crescent hotel
Who has already wached the moive
Why is his eyes open like that ? 7:46
The night swim is a great movie me and my dad loved it😊
"you cant turn around " turns around multiple times HAHA
This is where I live and as someone who’s been there it’s terrifying.. I get sick every time I walk into the building! The lady that owns it or did own it guessed my mom out of a crowd of people on the first try and told me how my grandma died and her favorite color without any information about her.. very cool place
You should take them to the conjuring
At 26:57 Sam turned around I think let me know if I am wrong😂❤
I love that you guys always bring good energy with preparation! Always great work! I can only imagine the vibes going on a adventure with yall!!
It’s so amazing to see there friend ship it is so incredible  Hit the like button if you thank so
37:58 I saw eyes in the bottom right corner
30:58 fnaf lore anyone? i've been saying this whole time that the one named William is William Afton and now the little girl Cassie which reminds me of Cassidy. reminds me of fnaf
Whose watching this 2024
Before i saw someone staring at the back while u were doing  charlie and lou
I love Rae and Friends! They are amazing kids and always make me laugh...but this just makes me think of the South Park episode with Ike and Billy Mayes (which also made me laugh) before that episode, I'd never even heard of this kind of show.  I don't believe in ghosts or paranormal activity beyond people's ability to make a buck off of gullible people. I'm retired, so I can travel...I might go here and sit in the wrong chair.  😁😁
Did anyone see the shadow outside the window 16:00
The stories: ehh  The pictures:💀💀💀
Ok I'm just Watching this and at 16:01 behind Valkyrae there is a shadow of something scurrying upwards behind her check it out and let me know your opinion of what it is. Thanks y'all
Like my comment if u love Sam and colby
Sam: Plasmophobio.  Colby : Phobia!    That killed me, thanks for the laugh, lol
Ishowspeed
I think during the Estes when Pearl and George were arguing and they said 'revenge' and 'had no other choice' they could have been talking about her coming to the hotel and how the onyl way they can rest is if she could get revenge on him for what he did to her
37:58 eyes in the right door!?!
At 16:00 there was a shadow behind the first chair
Me trying to not be scared  Shiver me timbers every second
I love you guys videos specially you guys humor hope tou have a wonderful year thanks for always helping us ❤
My daughter's birthday is in November
Sam— ”im a woman!”😂
wait you guys never saw the orb it was in front of rae and leslie
I feel that Leslie holding Rae’s arm in pearls room ruined the estis method. The point of it is to be disconnected ( no sight or sound)
16:00 in the window there's a shadow.
Um my fav YouTubers are you guys so um Sam and colby colab with Sam and Colby plz it will. E so funny
they definitely got laid that night
The spiders they encountered are cellar spiders! they are related to harvestmen spiders, and eat mainly other spiders and insects! they are known to leave their webs and hunt other bugs, similar to wolf spiders, and don't bite humans! (unlike wolf spiders) The female's main body can get up to 7-8 millimeters long and the male's body only gets to 6 millimeters long, and they can live for 2 years or more if kept in the right conditions! (sorry for the rant they're my favorite spider)
take corykenshin, he hasnt posted in so long
You should come to Montana to do some investigating.  Virginia city is a haunted ghost town, and the Dumas hotel in Butte is reputed to be highly haunted as well
Fgteev
Nice
Nobody noticed Colby turning around when he asked about the marbles and stairs
Wait pearl is in this vid and the joe Rogan vid
No guys not kids young men 17 to 23 years of age he lived in Illinois, and he would hire these guys then offer them a place to live in his house that he lived in and hired them he would drink and get them high so they thought he was cool until he wasn’t. He performed for Children but when it came to his prey they were teens to early 20s  buried them under the house, the smell is what eventually got him caught it was horrendous and he told his neighbors that it was a plumbing issue. The weekend he hosted a Bar B Que the police he was friends with knew exactly the smell that was coming from his house, just to give you real History
Uhh the fact that I have seen two times a black figure by my bus stop😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😭😭😭😭
I just remembered the content we watched was from The Haunted Side, that’s definitely it and there is no way in hell you make it out sober unless your liver is super human
A Paranormal Drinking Game you just got to love that, maybe just maybe they get a buzz when going through you’d when your buzzed or ripped, the more drunk you’re will affect the ghosts even stronger than a drink. You should start a drinking game colleges uses them all the time. Where I went to School CU we would have the craziest drinking game and it was a freaking miracle to make it to the end, we were watching a ghost hunting video and they always are over or around 3 hours, but when ever you hear the lead guy say did you hear that ? You took a shot or drink. OMG he had to say did you hear that at least a dozen times with in the first hour, this guys hearing was unbelievable or he was unbelievable but my god did we get hammered and many of us had no idea what we watched the night before
Just steadily bing watching you guys. Found you guys a couple of days ago because of Kallmekris's channel. 10/10 believer of the paranormal. 💜 Keep doing what you doing guys.   (Also Sam, Colby, you guys are cute lol)
you guys should colab with @comodo 2 and @darkmodeOB
Lol
Omg you guys were here and I missed it! Darn! I would have loved to come along to ghost hunt with ya!!!
37:57 Look in the right
I would not recommend drinking during any paranormal investigation. Just sayin.
You could not pay me enough money to play any sort of spirit or summoning game. I would quite literally void my bowels. Y'all were entertaining tho.
Sam and Colby almost all looked behind them broooo
16:02 window spiritttt
26: 30 umm ok 😂😳.
16:01  to 16:02 that shadow on the curtain please tell me that was Sam or Colby’s shadow….
Explore advanced places in architecture. I took care of the week. Some of them might have a tip. Best quick copy and leave it basically copies elephant is near it. There was 4 people for smooth dlose to extend and they captured. They saw 3 of them looking back.
Across the street and down the road a little bit is a Stained glass art shop, i went there with a friend of mine and she literally fainted and had a seizure. Apparently this wasn’t the first time this has happened in the shop either. So crazy that it is literally on the same street and seconds from each other.
*Colby gives one of the girls something* is that a shield?
Are we not gonna talk about how they were sponsored by UNIVERSAL????
51:20 a man yells get out
I would LOVE to go on an exploration with y'all!
Y’all should get Matt, Nick, and Chris to film again!! That video was so much fun!
People Who Think @Chosenone2 - Should Simply Piss-Off… Are “Allowed”🙄, To Like This Comment.
What’s Up With Gathering These Random Tarts…?  Is This A Ghost Show…? Or Dealing With Over-Privileged, Shopping With Daddy’s CC Types.  Lately, They’ve Been So Much Of A Distraction… It Ruins The Location & Production Value.  They Could At Least Be Good Looking… Like, KMK… But She’s Actually Cool.
You should go to the depot in Duluth Minnesota for a investigation. I have had a lot of  experiences myself along with my friend in the second floor of the depot and studio 4 for Minnesota ballet. We always feel nauseous and uneasy in the building and have seen multiple shadow figures including a little girl and a tall man in a top hat. Also try to bring kris and Celina with you guys if you go  because they are my pookies.😋
am i crazy orrr? i feel like at the double estes method in pearls room that they switched roles - feels like george was talking thriugh rae and pearl was talking through colby
Sam and Colby a where are you live?
Sam and   Colby

Pls help I have a bad cough 😷😷

23:10
I wish I could join, that estas method seems fun!
I've seen maybe 3 ghosts in total in my life, pushed aside by one, and a medium once told me I'm highly approachable by both the living and the dead. I would so love to go on an adventure with these guys! ^-^
At 33:47 you can see somthing moving in the background near the white/clear wall
if only the chair that didnt show something on SLS was the same as the two chairs that showed a figure ya know since those two chairs that are the same could be just mapping in figures
You’s should do another one with Kris and Celina again
37:58   did someone saw the two eye lighting in the conner it looked like two faces peeking when colby walked towards the door. Or it's just me   look at the right side of colby
The look on Sam's face when the third match lit successfully is so relatable-
Sheeeitt
yall bought the worst matches XD i used to use those they dont work well 😂
I would love to see y'all do videos with other OfflineTV members. Especially Michael Reeves lol
Anyone else wanna go to a haunted place with them or just me? Lol
Can you bring Kallmekris back?
U should stay at lake side inn  It is in mount Dora it has a backstory
Can these types of videos haunt you from watching it?
Can we have @triggered insaan and some other indian or call me mann plss
Does no one else hate it when people say “people who didn’t come from tiktok are allowed to like this comment” bc who the actual heck would come from TikTok except for a few edits?
I do not allow any negative spirits, energy , entities or ANYTHING else around me or my loved ones while watching this video . Thank you for everything you guys do and I'm sorry for taking any glances at something i shouldn't have
You guys should totally have Haley Kalili go on one with you guys she is so funny and I could see you guys being good friends ❤

" fall asleep to the comforting promise  of psalm4 as you name and lay your worries down at you gods feet,-- one by one. hand your stress over to jesus tonight as he instrusts us to, and meditate on this good night bible verse.

STOP THIS IS IN MY STATE
anyone from 4/12/24 here???
omg...Rae....
The fact ive witnessed this and experienced paranormal activity makes this 100x scarier
Around 16:15 there is something behind the window 😮
At 37:54 look at the doorway bottom right is that two glowing eyes or am i just tripping
Am i the only one that saw 2 glowing eyes
At like 37:58 there something that looks like eyes glowing and it freaked me out but I doubt it was anything
OMG I LIVE IN ALTON!!! I WALK BY THIS PLACE ALL THE TIME AHHHHHH I MISSED MEETING SAM AND COLBY 😢😢😢😢😢
It's always amazing what the power of suggestion will do. 😂
OML i wanna see Brandon Ferris do this with Sam and Colby!!!!
After its says carol there's a figure that comes into view in the background at 53:29
26:29 why did she say that😭
Why didn’t you all bring and wear neck braces for that entire hour? That would render it impossible (or severely difficult) to turn around and look over your shoulder!
What u guys are my fav creators
you should collab with the boys again
I have never heard of something as american as minutes compared to popcorn.... respect also during the esthes methode "he stole it" .... the weddingring ?
So you guys started the hosting game at Midnight on my birthday
Please do a video with @overnight
I don't claim any negative energy or spirits from this video
You guys should do a collab with Tara yummy and nessa Barrett
Hey sam and colby, see if zak bagans will go with yall.
I love how they do creepy sh!t and they are scared of a spider
I thought u were joking about William
4 popcorn bags in hell
I claim no bad energy for me or my family and friends you have no power
I always get super cold when I watch your videos. I hope the spirits of my house dont think it's me who says welcome...
bro who saw the eyes in the doorway as they finished the match lighting and was walking into the pool room
Bro if sam and Colby asked me to investigate id be happy to solo things coz i have 0 sense of self preservation
Invite rae and leslie again please they are so cute and fun
@markiplier
I fucking love this episode!  Leslie freaking the shit out a 1:04:49 and Sam's like just reaching out like don't worry.  That would probably me prior to the Estes method and during watching someone else do it.  Its a different side to see protectors/big bro energy the whole time.  So refreshing.  Esp big bro energy of being like, yeah we're leaving you alone *scares the shit out of the person, then listens in to make sure all is okay* .  L-O-V-E  I-T !
I feel like everyone takes the spirits saying “leave, get out”, or not wanting people there as a bad sign. A lot of the times what I think it might be due to the context I usually see those things being said in, is that they’re warning you or looking out for you. They might want you to leave because it’s not safe for you to be there, which they would know better than anyone about how safe it might be. I’m not saying every time you’re not wanted somewhere it’s a warning but a lot of the times. Usually when people start making a lot of noise and drawing a ton of attention to themselves then hear “leave or get out” it’s because there’s something there that could be dangerous to them.
The guardian angel story was crazzyyyyy
Hard working guys and work well together ❤️😄❤️❤️😄😄❤️❤️😄😄❤️❤️😄😃❤️❤️😄😄❤️
i have tried so many things to cure my conditions so i really get the desperation of those people
❤❤❤❤❤
me, my family, friends, everybody around me, and everyone watching this video, do NOT claim any negative energy, spirits, or attachments to follow us, watch us, attach to us, or be near us. i apologize for any glances at something i should not have seen. thank you for sharing your story.
no one is gonna talk about the eyes in the door in 37:57
Can you guys try out the Disney town? It’s like a really creepy\eerie town disney created and it’s a little too perfect.
16:00 what is that thing that went past the window
I’m only 51 minutes in, but they’re saying the name might be “Micheal”, but isn’t that the name of the dude at the party?
Does no one remember colby has cancer
57:17 Colbys face😭
Sam and Colby have tot me to not be afraid of ghost just what that can do
MICHEAL LIKE THE GUY THAT WANTED KRIS?! FROM THE CROSANT HOTEL 😰😨
Imagine @Dannyphanomexe did one of these. That’d be fun
I do not allow any negative energy on myself or anyone around me who I love and care about. Thank you for letting me hear your story and I do not wish harm on any spirits or entities. I apologise if I looked at or heard anything I was not supposed to. Amen <3
🖤
as a person who lives in the St. Louis metropolitan area i just went to Alton yesterday with my nephews and we went inside the hotel.  we found a room that was unlocked and went inside using a spirit box, never have i ever gotten anything clearer than this.  i said, “hello.” and it goes, “hello mister.” we all went crazy, then i said, “who am i talking to?” and it said, “you.” then what sounded like a laugh.  then later on it said, “Joshua” my name, and then when we were going to leave it said, “no.” “don’t leave.” clearer than day, so then we left.
56:34 #theclick #onetopic #dotjie
There is so many goat spirits in my house bc we killl them there ;-;
Get smi77y and his friends on this
Am I the only hungarian fan who calls Colby Kolbász sometimes?

How the hell does one get sponsored by Universal Pictures
Pearls room, that name is my name😁😁and super mysterious video
Y'all should definitely get Coryxkenshin on a video!
can you pls go to the clown motel? I am subscribed and I shared
In 16:04 I think I saw something running
@flair
He sure liked his pose😂 im only joking
yall we need a cresent hotel reunion lets get celina and kris back!!!
Omg this video was so hilarious with all the negative spirit and scary rituals i felt like with rae and leslie there was always a positive energy around. best parts were the migration around the whole room, counting up popcorn bags, little mouse running, perfect dual estes method, rae and leslie's friends in the party in slaughter house,colby telling about portal to hell in the slaughter house and sam's laugh, cupcakes for the party in the pool, match stick not lighting then the commotion and stress and fear , back story of rae not coming for the video, the question "will u ever go ghost hunting again" and what we might see in the future from sam and colby from rae's perspective 😂😂even the alcohol shots 😀😉🤭. Rae and leslie were so terrified and making jokes and laughing through the pain and sam and colby bringing more and more challenges making each one scarier than the other one😂😂. Great video great start to the new year. 👍 ❤❤
Haven't watched you guys in a while. But I came back to this!   I used to live in Alton, and my family talked about mineral springs for a while. So seeing this brings back so many memories.
Can you please have a colab with Shane Dawson! You guys would be the funniest group ever!!
I love Sam and Colby I’m a huge fan and I can even watch there videos at like anytime night time to early morning but this one for some reason actually scared me like and it made my stomach feel like just weird and I have no idea why I feel like I’ve seen worst but I also truly feel like I haven’t
I want to go ghost hunting with you guys so bad. Bring my husband 😂 he would shit his self. I think he don’t believe. But he knows I definitely do so he respects that and I was going to do ghost hunting videos too but never was able to start yet because my husband is a flight instructor and he is gone so much so makes it hard and I can’t drive I have epilepsy.
Theres a dprit that throws rocks so thats what maybe crashed
In the pool there was a hand print in the wall
Hi is your house haunted? 😀
16:00 Random shadow scared the shit out of me
Michael is the name of one of the angels if I'm thinking correctly so if people say he's inhuman then maybe they mean an angel of some sort but also you need to be careful around Michael because yes he is an angel and he will protect you from time to time but he is the prince of mischief and lies.
I dont allow any negative entity or any spirit to harm me and my family and my loved ones and also the people who live around me while watching the video. Jai bajrang bali ❤❤❤❤❤
46:54  “you want a shot” 💀
Delicious (no homo) 1:46
At 50:37 you can see an orb.
You guys give me nightmares but I lo❤ve your Chanel
.
I’ve been living in Illinois my whole life and I didn’t know about this thanks Sam and Colby btw when I turn 18 in 4 years I’m going here and I hope I see you guys there
I thought I couldn't hear the sounds they hear but I heard that crash it got me.
please bring jynxzi and sketch
12:15 and 1:05:49

@Angelia Mor
This video made my hands sweaty
every time Colby looks  at Sam think Colby is saying in his mind you are f crazy and i think Valkyrae  is great for Colby
I swear at 17:20 I saw a person behind the tour guide!
ISHOWSPEED............. WE NEED ISHOWSPEED ........... ITS GONNA BE FUNNY AS WELL AS SCARY AS F*** cuz i can guarantee that you guys will scare the living shit out of him.
At 20:12 something is running in the back but its ducked down and like bro 😅
When they were doing the hosting party they might have been talking to Saint Michael he is know for being a spiritual warrior in the battle of good versus evil. Love you guys and god bless you❤✝️
THeY ArE mY fAvORiTe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hate the pictures they put but not when they here a noise I really don’t get it
lmao that was not a guardian angel. good spirits don't touch people lol
You guys get the best evidence
The camera that showes human figures is just making a human figure off of the chairs
try to go to one of the ghost buildings in the Philippines, I'm sure you guys will have a blast
I'm waiting for the day they actually research saintism and realize it's not actually evil and we aren't. "opening portals" at this point your literally just pissing him off by the shit your doing aka going into abandoned  Saintic temples and going to places taking the piss and being disrespectful your just asking for shit to that's please if your gonna do this in all respect do your research
16:02  does anybody notice the like slam/ shadow against the window? Nvm it was just a car 💀
23:05  People die in hotels all the time. I worked at a hotel for three years there was a death in the hotel about 3 to 4 times a year (though it was mostly suicides)
@clix should go out with you guys in a investigation
The part when they were talking about the woman in blue in the middle curtain, you can see Shadow walk by
Help I am a girl and when they got to pearls room I started bursting out crying and I didn’t know why. Plus I started crying before they even said that women feel sadness 😅
The moment when pearl said he stole it 1:02:55 I’m suprised they didn’t think about the ring that her husband took off her finger.
I love Sam and colbys spooky content      Like if u agree
They COLLABORATED OMGG?!?!
Illinois is my state 😭😭😭I’ve also been in that town before …. Also those big spiders are daddy long legs they scare me so much even tho they won’t hurt you but I beg to differ.:)
Colby turned around when doing the ritual
Leslie so pretty 🌊
25:15 Did Sam and Colby drink from the same bottle?
Would you guys ever let a 13 year old join I’m really interested in this stuff please consider it
i wanna do the estes method i think that's  the name like the headphones and blind fold
👌🏿👈🏿😊
Omg I’ve been waiting for a video when Sam and Colby would come to Alton!!! I’ve lived in Alton since forever and I love how haunted it is. I’m so happy that they finally came here!!! 🥳
This looks so scary 😨
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮

These two friends are damn prodigies of each owns manifestation so they'll always have the bond they share and will always be the "guy" that do this stuff, sorry zak baggins and all y'all at discovery channel but these guys are making a finite name for themselves, I mean.........over ten million subscribers DAMN SON!!!🎉🎉🎉😅😮😂🎉🎉🎉
My goodness, girls, I can't even, goodness the two of you are too adorable 😻🥰 Edit: Btw, my wife loves ya guys and all that you all do content wise, have saved a many a day for the two of us, thanks for restoring our (my wife and I) faith in humanity. And, sam n Colby!! We love y'all too man!!
i have a theory that if u do a astral projection in that place and maybe u can find the (portal). And ur body is gonna go through the portal since is just ur (astral body) not physically body. Probadly u can see all sort of astral people.
Can you or have you explore the Cecil hotel! It would be a cool collab to do with(I forgot his name) the guy who has orange hair and lives in an apartment near it.
37:55 there are eyes around the right corner bright eyes like that of a child.
Hiiiii I'ma big fan😊
Airra parsons ❤
37:57 eyes in door or just reflection?
Plz make more vids I love ur vids so keep going plz
You should do a video with twin paranormal
Sam and Colby: AHHH!!! Ghost: yes got e’m! Sam and Colby: that’s a huge spider web! Ghost: are you shit$ing me right now😒🫥
37:57 there were eyes in the background
how did i not know this was in my home state, time for a sleepover!
Hey I would love to get together  and I'll take you to the  most haunted  place In Greenville  Kentucky it's called  the  palace  theater and I have seen many  goust and it was a bit different than I was expecting 😅
37:56  look at the door beside Colby
I know sam and colby arent going to see this but i wish i could be there with you guys i really wanna go on a real ghost hunt and do the estes method
I thought sam" said what are you looking at babe"to cobly but he didn't team agree  👇😊
56:25  HEY GUYS.. 😅 I THINK YOU SHOULD DO A COLAB WITH SAM AND COLBY..😅 YOU GUYS ARE MY ALL TIME FAVORITE PEOPLE <3  @samandcolby
I thought he was having a heart attack 😳 13:37
I think I understand why when you were talking to Lou and he turned off the flashlight. When one of you asked the question do you want my shot? Also he turned it off because he thought why would I drink something that I died from I don’t want to drink that and that’s like why he kept like responding. No to she asked the question do you want my shot too?  And Coby be like a random sound HeLlO 😂
I claim no negative energy
The way Colby said “that’s a lot of stairs😫” I can’t 😂
16:01 something was in the window
@markiplier
Can you make more ghost hunting videos with the Sturniolo Triplets? That one video was so good.
Bro was in thé backrooms
It’s so funny watching people who’ve never done a ghost hunt freaking out over evidence 🤣
44:47 when Alice says “Limp” could it be referring to the guy who died by jumping in the pool and hitting his head? If it knocked him out, he would’ve gone limp when he drowned…
The guide jumpscaring them twice was hilarious 🤣
I love you guys so much and your videos!!
Charleville Castle in Ireland Tullamore Co. Offaly in the top 10 in Europe if yere lookin oh and bring the Boyz
Thoroughly enjoyed this video. It was great seeing Sam and Colby take care of Rae and Leslie. Keep it up , Please.
Also zumiez is my fav store, been watching your videos since you were making vines! I love you guys and I finally have a new job so once I get enough I’m definitely buying Merch!!!
So I was watching your video and no joke something moved under my bed while my dog and I are laying on it! Scared tf out of me! Nothing can come through a video right!?
Who else wishes to go ghost hunting with snc or just meet them?
How the guide said he got saved by a Guardian Angel well the name they got is called Micheal well he’s a Guardian Angel he watches and protects claiming good energy.
It was God who cursed them "On God"
who's here from tiktok
It's a movie   :)
You ned to se smile it's so creepy
I NEED CELLBIT OVER HERE
56:48 The name means "follower of Christ". This could mean the spirit in the slaughter house could be positive.
Why did cloby smack us into his pee pee in the intro?😂
8:37 Willam Appleton?😂
This was such a great collaboration ❤❤
aaa I’m so in love with this collab 🫶
I CAUGHT SOMETHING when they was talking about pearl and they show the girl sitting down u look in the window that was like wrap on it u can see a shadow go through it and it was crouching?!? ⚠️⚠️ GO TO VIDEO (16.01)
whats super interesting. i know this was 3 months ago lol. but the orb that pushed the guide he said it could have been a guardian angel, and it was talking about november and prayer. it also said michael who is yk a poweful archangel who defeated lucifer. it could be nothing but still maybe it was michael or someone who served michael.
there was a figure at 16.01
Hey Sam and Colby maybe u could try get aphmau to do it, aphmau or Ryguyrocky acc no defo ryguyrocky
i am a huge fan >>>
49:05 SAMMM 😭
Michael could been Michael The archangel
Why is it that whenever I watch a Sam and Colby I always shit myself not from the ghosts but from the random ass pictures they put in their video
The Bebe was the most important part of the video
yo 16:01  a shadow figure walked by and hit something 💀😤
“Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.” ~Mark Twain.

I think you and Sam should go to a haunted forest for a whole day with kris and Celina 😊
NIGHT SWIM IS SO GOOD

When they reference a game it physically pains me
i live in illinois

1:05:04 that's a domestic violence relationship not a regular married couple 😭😭
sponsored by universal now. wow. you guys have come so far.
I don't know why I keep watching them at night
no offense to the girlls or anything, but they were so annoying, like if u were gonna be scared and u knew why go?
Scary
Leslie & Rae: my life is like a video game 🎮 👾
Coby stay turning around when theyre not supposed too
36:21 i said in my mind "and thats how there 4 more spirits in that area"
Can we please get more with Fuslie and Valkyrae please
37:57 what were those eyes in the bottom right corner
Sam: “We’ll come back in 7 minutes.” * Looks at camera * 😳 Rae: “Wdym.” 😖 Sam: “We’re definitely coming back.” * Looks at camera * 😳 This was great 👍The end was absolutely bone chilling
Yo I saw two eyes when it was on 38 minutes
Hii sam and Colby I'm your biggest fan I have all you merch.
Didn't this place burn down early 2023?
How the fuck did u get sponsered by Universal?!❤
‼️‼️WHO ELSE SEES…‼️‼️ @16:00 black shadow in the bk window between the two girls running from our right to left, like towards the girl standing, or idk if it is one of your guys shadows just moving
i would love to see @Kelsiedavies on one of these investigations!! it would be so sick
Valkyrae is cringe
Idk know if its lights or smth but did anyone notice the thing in the right doorway at 37:57
How old is sam and colby
I saw something  22:30
Some where at 41:50 colby turned around?
pearl said he stole it talking about the ring
Not me upset because they were 30 mins from my town 😢😂
Idk what to do there just so freaking hot 😅😅😅😅
There is a haunted prison in Ohio you guys should check out.
mrbeast next
Lol, each video is worse than the one before it
I feel like OfflineTV should play Phasmaphobia with Sam and Colby
Seriously Gacy never killed in his clown suit. He was a well respected and popular kids clown.  he killed kids dressed normally not in his clown suit. Its  a Massive misconception
@kubzscouts
@kubz scouts should do a vid with y’all
we want this collab again
Hi I’m late
You should have airrack
I kinda wanna see them do a video with Danny Gonzales
Yessssssss plssssss
I really wish I met you guys whenever you came to Louisiana you should do an episode on hotel  Bentley and you should be let me be in it, now I’m a kid so obviously that’s a joke but really I would like to see and episode on more Louisiana
No, none of those movies are “the iconic movies of our time” no.
The fact that one of them said, “oh yeah I don’t believe” while both girls are freaking out 😂
Did anyone else see the eyes in the bottom right corner at 37:57 ?
Collab with iamjaystation when??
wait  can it come through the screen bc i felt something push me and i was on the stars
I really would love to see a colab with glam and gore! 😍

“ he stole it “ - Pearl said during the estis method. The tour guide said that the husband took pearls ring when she died instead of being upset that he lost his wife … wow !!!
41:50 he just turn his back like nothing xD
Bro I live like 8 min away from alton
How to scare the shit out of normal youtubers:
Colby turned around during the hosting
Samantha Eve x Larri
no way the most haunted small town in america is in my state....
William
i really want to go on an investigation with the boys 😭
15:59 look at the window…
MARKIPLYER NEEDS TO PLEASE PLEASR IM BEGGING
Can yall try to investigate the Alamo
Leslie concerning face during the sauna clip
IDK ITS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE IDK BUT WHAT WAS BEHIND LESLIE IN 22:11
They should bring Stormedy. It would be fun😄
we need more cool videos that are crazier than this one
My sister and I love watching their videos.
This is crazy for me because im living a town called Edwardsville Illinois, which is like 15 minutes away from me🤯🤯🤯
idk if anyone’s said this but imagine the supernatural cast going ghost hunting with sam and colby 🤭
Sam and Colby need to invite LaurenZside to a investigation
It would be so funny and get you guests reaction
Sam and colby you guys should so do a normal investsgation but as Samantha and Colleen
When I was like 12 or 10 at my house I was playing outside and there was a big black figer and it looked like a bare but it was way bigger and I didn't see a head or and color on it and I thought it was a bare so I aks my mom is there bares around here han she said there are no bares around here but I feel like it had to been a spirit or something
15:52 something was at the window
That is hella weird i had a dream one time and i was there at that pool and i died in my dream
People who barely watch scary things 😭
also can you guys like please go to europe, like where the nazis did satanic rituals in world war 2 and the concentration camps during the holocaust WITH @Tank Fish with his friends
can you bring tankfish with his friends with you guys?
I Think you shold bring Amber!! 👉🏻👈🏻🥺
Please bring back Amanda😢
You guys asked if someone would sit in the middle chair and I'm guessing pearl moved to the middle chair! It was completely empty until Sam asked for someone to sit there
Once again another awesome video🎉
Bro I swear when the couple having a whole conversation I swear this is next lvl 2024 toxic couple’s therapy
I'm gonna do this when I'm older
Listen, I know you guys probably get a lot of fan messages about wanting to experience what you guys do and wanting to be apart of it, which btw would be crazy if I was the only one because you guys are SAM AND MF COLBY! But honestly, I would love to go to a location with you guys, I’ve been a fan since the Queen Mary episode or when Sam would do those crazy challenges in that 2 story  house for no reason  on y’all’s YouTube! I’ve always been interested in this stuff, I grew up in a haunted house where I experienced my ankles getting grabbed, waking up to my bed shaking, all drawers being opened, poltergeist activity. If you guys ever brought a fan to an investigation I would sign anything to do it!! I am spiritually sensitive to energies and can physically tell if it’s a bad or negative energy by the way I feel once I enter an environment. I would love to do any investigation with you guys. I’ll just need an heads up, to take time off of work, plus I make a lot of good commentaries when I’m in a highly haunted environment. If you guys ever do consider taking a fan into an investigation please consider me!!! Also, off topic I love when you guys collaborate with Kris and Celina, those are so entertaining and relatable.
lou is just happy :)
if chuck norris pulls up  the entities will say sorry for being there before him
16:18 smash
14:06 i just started simping bruh

If you love Sam Colby you have to like this comment
At 45:07 it may have been archangel Micheal who is a warrior angel so he may have pushed him out of the way because he could be fighting a evil spirit who tried to kill the guide
Bud is not gojo
This is probably one of the most not scary videos you have made because of them there (Val / Fuslie) but it’s still a little banger but it’s a BANGER as usual
Hi Sam and Colby please and my sister and my aunt we’re going to a hotel called State James y’all should record there it’s a haunted hotel or else I want to be and also go shit James
ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴀʏ ᴄᴏʟʙʏ ᴊᴜsᴛ ɪᴄᴏɴɪʟʏ ᴊᴜsᴛ ᴡᴀʟᴋs ʙᴀᴄᴋᴡᴀʀᴅs ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴀ ɢᴏᴏғʏ ғᴀᴄᴇ 30:01

i have seen leslie look over her shoulder soooo many times LOL
Miss Pearl really does deserve better. She had been abused for her entire marriage and ended up at the hotel, choosing to overdose because, IMO, she most likely wanted to finally get away from it all, she didn't care how.  But even now her husband bickers with her into the afterlife, for what? He was the one who abused her, he should leave her alone. He got the ring, what more does he need?
Bro at 37:58 you can see a pair of eyes in the doorway
Go to Edinburgh manor  please  and thank  you my name  is kendra kay hines
“f*ck him.” “DAMNNNN”
Jason the "Old Man" here... Those flashlights are great for investigations because almost anything can and will turn them on/off.
Sam and Colby out here converting people. Love it lmao
I love snaks😊❤
This is insane
People casually messing with jinns 💀
Probably nothing but, when the Oculus said “Gag”, I was in the middle of gagging 😭
Worst vid
The zoom in to the balls transition💀☠️
You must go to 16:00 time stamp look at the paper covered window behind the cover someone or something moves and creates a shadow
37:57 YO GUYS YOU GOTTA REACT TO THIS, THERE'S 2 GLOWING GREEN EYES IN THE DOORWAY, RIGHTSIDE OF COLBY
Who dat man 33:16
Sam and Colby are like free therapy i love yall soooo much
1:03:02 “he stole it” is it like the ring?
37:57 it looks like eyes in the door
Every one go to 16:01 and look at the window you can see a shadow even though there is no one there
I feel like George and pearl was saying he was gonna give you nightmares if you didn’t leave money for them 😭
Soooo did anyone else notice that there is almost the same 7 foot tall shadow figure in this video named William like the one in the Fairfield infirmary named Willie
you should do something with skyyjade
When pearl said “wil come help me” on the estest method I immediately thought of pearl asking the tall shadow figure man for help (William), or is that just me 😭🙏
is it normal that I started feeling sick while I was watching the video?
“I want to throw into the pool.” I would totally do that to my best friend except she would take me with her 😭
I don’t know if you’ll see this but it would be really great if you took Cody and satori from the conjuring hell week videos to go back to the black Dalia hotel. I forget the name but I’m sure you’ll know the hotel name. And maybe help to figure out who murdered her.
@lol.jayson needs to go on a ghost hunt
Can you guys try to contact flamingo/Albert to go with you guys next? Also I love y'all videos keep up the amazing work.! Always waiting for a new video to come out. ❤
did anyone see those 2 orbs flying around at 40:57
If the light thingy pushed you so hard to the wall and the other wall could of fallen to the folks it might be 55% guardian angel, Since it saved you and it is a light, but it can also be a demon that pushed you and could of hit him so hard that it shaked and dropped to the folks.

😊 Hi I am new subscriber😊
who else saw the shadow figure go past behind the tarp at 15:57
46:18 An orb behind leslie! Lou is there with her!
Hey this is my hometown :)
you guys need to do a video with GroovyGavin, he is my second favorite YouTuber and a collab with him and you guys would be legendary (it's also his dream to do a video with you guys)
I do not allow any spirits or entities to follow me and I have God on my side they cannot hurt me God bless
37:57 WHAT ARE THOSE TWO LIGHTS IN THE DOORWAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN THAT LOOK LIKE EYES
Wait am I the only one that saw something go past the window at 16:00 😮
Sam: "The only rule of the game is to not look behind you."  Colby: "Alright"  Colby 5 minutes later: Looks behind him while calling for cassie.   No wonder why almost none of the spirits responded -
Yall when she found out she was bait she was like   w...        Read more
so... did anyone notice colby turning around a couple of times or was it just me?
During the dual estes method pearl said 'you stole it' and i think that definitely meant the wedding ring
Idk if anyone caught this or if I was just tweaking but at 51:10 when they zoom in on the girls there is a black this up in the corner and to me it looks like a hand and then it disappears.
Hehehehehehe spiritus
then way colby said oh sh*t  brings back memorys of them getting aressted and sam baling him out
I love you Sam and Colby ❤ y’all are on my top five YouTube favorites!
Sam always does the horror movie white person “hello?”
wait where is this at?
51:30 was that Mickey?
33:14  Bring a friend! Your friend: *paces in background in smol and gamingly
Not a giant mane named William Me: har har har har har har har har har har
Why do I watch this at night?
I remember watching this video back 2 months ago and I said "This video ain't scary??" And I was got humbled so bad because that same very day at night I literally got a dream of that place. The doors kept on slamming like the place where they were trying to invite the ghosts by using the candles. I was alone and the door kept on slamming while the something was banging on the walls. Anyways, I'm not gonna repeat my mistake - 😙🤭👍
SERIOUSLY THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD TO LAKE LANIER!!! SEARCH UP THE HISTORY OF THE TOWN THAT LIES BENEATH IT- we just went on a vacation there and theres even a horror movie on it. So many traumatic events happened..
People who finally bought snacks so they can watch sam and colby in peace 👇🏻                   HERE
I protect myself and anyone else watching this video from all bad energies, entities, intentions, and spirits. I welcome the good spirits and wish them peace.
Sam and Colby please colab with the boys please I enjoy both sides of ghost research or exploration
Whenever I want nightmares I watch sam and colby
You should investigate cars that have bin in crashes
The fact that I can dox rn is crazy I won't tho ima keep that to myself cause I don't have anything to do on like what am I gonna say? There name it's on the channel
Imagine Eddie vr and Sam and Colby that would be a crazy collab
i got a callange idea for u
im a big fan congrats on 11.7m
In the window walking
Wtf when he was talking about Jorge thawn there was a shadow in the background I saw something move
Sam: *cant pronounce phasmophobia* me (a phasmophobia gamer): "sam! is PHAS-MO-PHO-BI-UH!" *dying of laughter*
7:48 was that a be hive😭
litteraly once they started the ritual and said dont look behind you, i've felt something too on my neck and i have no idea what it is
Sam and colby try to collab with the krew itsfunneh and the others
39:22
You guys should have a horror Channel or you can do it on your react channel but you should play horror games and collab with other gamers!
Colby i never believed in love at first sight, but that was before i saw you. Sam are you a bank lone? Because you've got my interest
There’s been rumors that somewhere in Hershey there is a haunted house that’s not been on sale its like a mansion idk if its true but been like trying to find out about it wonder if they  would do it
"my vibrator turned off" anybody catch that.
Who else saw something in the window 15:55
All I need to say is…SLAY!!
At 16:01 you can see a shadow outside
You should do amp or Kai only 😊
Yall need to do a Collab with @Theboys !!! ❤
WE NEED ANOTHER COLLABORATION WITH @KallMeKris and @Celinaspookieboo
One of my family members has been a tour guide for you guys
BACKROOMS MENTIONED XPLR BACKROOM CROSSOVER PLS I WANT NEED CONSUME TISM
When Sam said I’m a woman I died that was so funny
Colby: agreed that it was for pigs Tour guide: it’s a conveyor belt for water Colby: ugh idiots
Yo 🤘🏻 Kobe  you are. So. Cool 😎😎😎😎😎😎
this is so crazy to me i used to watch you guys when no one knew who you were, i would talk about you guys all the time and no one had even heard of you guys and now people come up to me while i’m watching your videos and ask “omg is that sam and Colby i love them” it’s legit crazy how far you guys have come. i mean getting sponsored by universal studios is crazy. i’m so insanely proud of you. ps i would join your explore club but i’m beyond broke :(
when they were not meant to look over there shoulder colby looks over to see what is behind him
UR TELLING ME YOU DIDNT SEE THAT AT 15:59
FIRE IN THE HOLEE
Thank you for your stories. I don’t allow any negative energies to follow me or my loved ones.
You should invite mr beast
i live in illinois i wish i was there
At the time 45:07 when it says michael, it might be a coincidence but what if it’s St. Michael the archangel who was there and that’s who delayed the guide and saved all those people from the wall crashing down (just throwing a random thought out there)
I went here with my friends and I was watching your video and thought the picture of the outside of the cave looked familiar and I was right we took pictures and none of us knew about the history of it
I love might swim such a good movie
Bring Joe bart
these girls r js making the vid so un scary
I've been there not that scary for me nothing happend
@kelsidavis
I know how to make holy water… You boil the hell out of it
a ghost at minute 3:33
Shane Dawson and Rylan
I LOVE YALLLLL
You should collaborate again😊
I'm watching this at 10 o clock
Can we just talk about that transition? 1:48
Her face was like 😮
Also plzzz do it with jschlatt cause you did it With tommyinnit once and they are both best friends
I Don't know why But after watching this video i feel.....like....... uncomfortable  and cold and i just got  germy. im a medium so i definitely know that this place is haunted.
Wish I could go ghost hunting with you guys, I've watched almost all you videos. I'm an empath and have cleansed every single one of my houses.
it’s crazy how I live in Alton il 😂😂
Rae and Sam Look like a couple
I sall corys fear... The shadoman
Hehehe
Hi Sam and coby
"it was just a limestone" i say that every time something scary happens
Like the video
I live about 2 hrs from Alton 🫶🎀😭
Dis girls are annoying
In the window in pereles room was a shado😐😐😐😐
Is rae sam new girlfriend? And leslie colby girlfriend?
Bro when they are lighting the matches and then they start to leave there is 2 glowing eyes how did they miss this
Leslie and Rae saying bye to Carol, Harry, Tina, etc. in a happy enthusiastic way, Alice Box: Tomb hahaha
I love this so much! Especially since it’s 1am-
to be honest all af u guys look like a perfect couples😂😅
Most iconic collab ever
9:04 there were two white eyes behind Valkyrie
When Sam and Colby said to tag your favourite creator i choose aimsley and Ranboo or Tubbo and piso
It would have been funny if at the start of the video she said "there are so many cobwebs it feels like im in asmongolds house"
I literally just went to zumez to get a skateboard
bruv imagine KSI and Deji going on a ghost hunt with you. That would be CRAZY!!! Guys lets make it happen
Omg heyy sam and Colby i like COlby better sorry sam ... But i like you too . I want to be in one of your videos but I'm not old enough.....😭😭😭😭... But I can tell you what I have seen in my house.. I've been talking to nothing. For ages. It's like I'm talking to random people I keep hearing stuff I keep seeing stuff.. it's so crazy. But like I'm friends with every single ghost in my house 👁️👄👁️..... By the way like to Sam and Colby!!!!!! ... And love them with your life  Or else I might as well take your life...not really.....❤
Collab with Garrett Watts lmao
How has no one pointed out the weird looking chinless silhouette shadow clip at min 30:48?? 😂😂😂😂 this picture has me dying rn
Y'all should go to rucker mansion in Everett, Washington. Its rumored to be haunted by the matriarch of the family

I would love to see uncle tics with colb and Sam 😂😂 uncle tics would be crack up
it’s so crazy because being from here the energy is so heavy on the inside of this place, i can’t even last 20min inside, props to you guys
BRO THEY WERE IN ILLINOIS? 😔 Dang- we got haunted stuff here? 😭
The guide sounds like he wants to touch valkyrae and fuslie and a bit weird
For the hosting room Colby looked behind him 😭
you guys should do a collab with the boys since they watched all of you week in the conjuring house
we NEED a collab with @yeptheboyz
43:54  if it helps you channel it might be cool to find a way to have those playing when doing the estes method
@wgps bros
7:29 Leslie looks possessed
Was there another cousin aborted. That hurts me
I hate watching these videos at night 👻
would you ever concider an older persons perspecrive esp/ from a native american like me?
HELLLLL NAHHHH. WHEN THEY WERE COUNTING AND LIVHTING MATCHES MY FUCKIN LIGHT TURNED ON IT TURNED ON EXACTLLYTYY WHEN THEY TRIED TO LIGHT THE 3rd MATCH 😭😭😭 fuck that
Come to Brazil here we have a ton of haunted places
you guys should invite benoftheweek💀🥲
you guys should come out to Anoka Minnesota they have a big fenced-in asylum that I would really like to see.
Named william?! WILLIAM AFTON?! THE MAN BEHIDE THE MURDERS!
Colby: (scares ghost)  Sam; (always has a ghost in his a$$) 💀💀💀💀💀
I remember Sam doing the hosting game in the trap house🥹it was the first time I’ve ever seen a Sam video or the second, the first one was probably him playing the shadow man game. Good memories
Sam: "and a seven foot figured man👀" colby: "named WiLlIaM😩"
l love your channel, and I have a pool.
you guys should try using magnets becuase they sense electromagnetic force and could attract or repel yk. just a suggestion tho
23:04, isn't someone peeking at you in back
you guys should deffoooo team up with the amp squad
As I was watching this my aircon turned off by its self
not them taking shots with spirits
people who turned on the lights in the room they're wacthing this in within the first 4 mins of the vid: 👇 (includes meh lol)
1:32 that why rae looks familiar, ive seen her play among us with corpse husband and a few other people
@baylenlevine come out ghost hunting would be mad funny
So I was a cop for 24 years.  I don’t know why but the majority of suicides are done in hotels.  The cheaper hotels don’t patch the ceilings and in my personal experience I have laid in a hotel bed with my ex and have seen 4 bullet holes in the ceiling.  So, older hotels probably have way more suicides in them than reported on the internet.  Keep looking up kids, because that’s where it’s at.
38:50 a little gremlin spirit 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ppl how love hell week                                                                                                  👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
Im obsessed with your videos
I hope Rae and Leslie come back for another one! I loved their interactions and comments.  The Estes method in this one was great. Not the craziest they've had, but certainly among the better ones. When they insulted each other I was amazed they really got that. Sometimes the tour guides will say some of the stuff other investigators have gotten, but Sam and Colby don't always get the same. It's awesome confirmation when they do.
I watch yall in school i love y’all’s videos i love them so much
Does anyone notice eyes 👀 in the right corner at 37:55
Im about to visit  this  place  cuz its only  3 hr and 55 minutes away 😅
VIBEEEEEEEEEE 1:43
If you think about it the orb that was probably a guardian angel that pushed the guide could have been Micheal as in archangel Micheal and when “Micheal’s” name popped up it was also saying things like prayer further pushing the theory of it being archangel Micheal. Just my thoughts
is it me or did sam and colby did not see the shadow behind the window passing
16:29 behind colby.... is it george??? thats who he was talking abt
I’m more interested about Pearl and George. Kinda wish they extended little longer.
1:04:23 Pearl was talking through Colby
Go to time 37:58 and look down the black hallway on the right you will see white eyes
I loved how you all worked togetherrr
named william
did anybody see the glowing eyes and when the doorways when they left that room?😮
SAM AND COLBY LOOK AT 37:55 I SWORE THERE WERE TWO EYES IN THE CORNER..
This could just be superstition or entirely wrong, but Micheal, the supposed guardian from the pool and last year, could’ve been saint Michael, who was holding back the “shadows” since they did the ritual wrong he was warding off the evil spirits. 45:06
I am definitely tagging Unspeakable and Preston for this.  https://youtube.com/@Unspeakable?si=hIFvpjfJpU0EzfHU https://youtube.com/@PrestonPlayz?si=BMQXythuxnS1WGCY  I love your video's like always it's amazing❤
🥰😍😘💌💘💝💖💓💓💞💕💟❣💔💋❤‍🔥💯❤❤❤‍🩹🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🤛👫👩‍❤‍👨👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🦮🐕‍🦺
If @samandcolby would reply I would start studying 😀😀😀
37:57 wut the hell! ( Two eyes at the door )
you guys should collab w garrett watts and andrew siwicki! i bet if garrett did the estes method he’d hear some crazy shit
People who live in Illinois  👇
After the conjuring series this feels more comfortable
You guys gotta do a full video with Garrett and Andrew!!
41:50 colby casually looking behind him
I was just watching but then I heard sam say awaksjhh at 51:58
Congrats on the Universal sponsorship!
I do not allow anything negative from this video to affect me or anyone around me. I am protected by a bright glowing light and come with an open mind and looking out of curiosity. I take only good from this
My daughter loves you guys and she's only 10
You should collaborate with hype myke and Jesse
I now Olivia Rodrigo
guys if you look to the right of Sam at 37:55 there is a pair of eyes or possibly 2
i love you guys im going to do what you guys are doing when im older
I do not allow any negative spirits, energy , entities or ANYTHING else around me or my loved ones while watching this video . Thank you for everything you guys do and I'm sorry for taking any glances at something i shouldn't have
3:35 AYO😨 ngl it is a coolio pose😮
Tima
At 19:12, in my mind I said “bro it’s just William, chill out” 😂
Sam and Colby go to  15:40 and wait and look at the window  it like a black figure
She looks like Jenna Ortega
Can you  please do project mathem in Brighton  at Lincoln
hello i am a bigggggg fan i subscribe and liked your wellcome
is it me or does it look like a shadow moves behind where the window is here 16:00
Omg help
Colby I love you
The way that the chair in the pool next to Leslie was shaking lol
This is actually crazy because I went to go see the night swim like 5-6 days ago-ish and I see this 😭
Um I would love to be in a video :)
She turnedaround😭🙁
My sister said I want to MARRY colby
take coryxkenshin on a ghost hunt !!
The merch looks fire 🔥🔥(literally)
22:11 did you guys look  behind? What was that. Wait it was a car
Hansum fella, Soup, or Jynxzi would fucking phenomenal
i think you guys should go to a supposedly haunted hotel in Michigan called the Grand hotel, it’s extremely old, i would absolutely love to see you guys investigate it!
48:41 they were not talking about popcorn I swear
At about 16 minutes someone walk past the curtain thing behind u can see a shadow 😮
tagging myself for a ghost adventure
yess it was a realy nice movie
Im in love with Valkyrae😫
Oh my getting sponsored by universal! That’s a massive step! Congrats
Sam and Colby please take the @dolan twins on a ghost hunt i beg you
🫣
My name is Leslie too 1:21

I definitely think that Colby was voicing for Pearl and Rae was voicing for George
Where's a new video?.. it's been 2 months. Please tell me u guys are fine ..
i love how everybody was like "aawwwwww" and then colby over here "OH SHIAAT" HAAHAH ITS SO FUNNY OML
32:00 "In every hole?" I LAUGHEED AT THIS SO HARD
sam give me your number I want to call you
My family and loved ones and myself do not claim any negative energy from watching this video or my loved ones and family throughout this series. Thank you so much for listening to our side of the story. I apologise for any glances or stares i shouldn't have made. I am sorry.
In the pool the name thwy said was micheal like the bad spirit they talked about in the basement
Jenxei
dude i live so close to alton, i could have met you guys :(
No shot they got sponsored by Universal Studios 😮
did anyone else see the 2 dots in the doorway at 37:57 ? or is it my eyes playing tricks?
@Mrbeast
I want to see a collab with corpse husband😂😅😭
I live close to Alton and growing up we were told about that hotel! I have been on the tour many times and we always see stuff happening!!
“Let’s go to the slaughterhouse” *burger king ad ques*😭🤣🤣🤣
I do not claim this negative energy
If you rearrange a deck of cards enough times, then statistically it will eventually be in its original formation. Due to the fact that time is infinite, the same goes for the particles in your brain. There is a higher chance of your brain briefly forming in a void complete with memories of living than there is of you actually existing on earth. The only thing you can be sure of is the existence of your own mind. If you are reading this, you are likely the only real consciousness to have ever existed in the entire universe. You are alone. Nothing is real. This theory is called the Boltzmann Brain.
@ChizPlays it would be so funny to see you in one of these vids
PLEASE COLLAB WITH TX2
you're telling me y'all were in illinois and I DIDNT KNOW?????
"named ✨️WiLlIaM✨️"                                          - colby brock
The SLS camera at the chairs is just it picking up the shape of the chair. The third chair won't have anything until Sam puts the camera more towards the front of it. You can see that at 1:00:06 the camera is actually picking up the chair's shape.
Love Rae and Leslie! Its so intriguing to see how Youtubers just know each other. I'm still lost on the social circles of youtube
If I didn't hear wrong. I think at 53:33 when the girls got the name Carol it seemed like Sam also said Carol but he was not there
oh hello you [ _ ]
coca cola eapuma
Wht are you guys so cute its so cool
Sam and colby I love watching your videos ❤ You guys should definitely stay 24h or overnight  there in the  pool. Would love to see thatt
ANYONE ELSE SEE THE EYES WHEN THEY TURNED TO GO BACK IM THERE
sponsored by universal pictures is absolutely malicious
37:57 what are those sets of eyes
16 minutes in and there's smt in the window istg
16:01 the window had a shadow movement I hope that isn't a ghosty that scared me 😅
you guys should do something with mr beast  mabye do a 24 hour challenge video with mrbeast or last to leave the haunted hotel wins
What he said was she was hospitalized 14 times of the husband beating her
POV:ME JUST FOUND OUT HOw COLBY AND SAM MET💀💀💀 the discripson be like BAND NERDS 💀💀
i live in illnois so this scares me like bad
bruhhh you need to take Jc ghost hunting fr
Sam and colby taught us to be afraid of bugs not paranormal lol
I love your vids and you two gave me an idea to do a YouTube channel
I think you guys does a nice job for the new generation to have a more open mind of what is the life here, and what is actually all around. It  is really opening beliefs about where dead people goes, how much they are in a way still like humans in general.  I would really like you to invite cody and satori again this year, that has so much love
come to kempton park hospital in south africa🙌 most haunted place in africa
the part that scared me the most was george and pearl sitting in the chairs. the way they were consistently there each time freaked me out 😭
I really hope they do another one cause they're really great. Leslie and rae did great
I’m from Illinois
I LOVE THIS!!! AWESOME COLLAB
Are you from Newcastle upon Tyne because l am😊❤
At  45:06 they said the name was Micheal then at 51:43 they said the non human thing might be named Micheal so they were talking to him at the pool….
At the time 46:35 it mentioned shadows like they said William is a shadow
Please take Paul cuffaro on a ghost hunt lol
We need same and Colby to make up a scary story for kids to not eat spchocolate
It's so far from their normal content and so out of their comfort zone that I think Dan and Phil would be really funny to bring to a ghost hunt... The jokes from them? omg
I love your videos  I’m subscribed 😊 pls can you pin this comment plss 😊👇
Colby and Rea look like a sibling
WOW.  Another cool and funny Estes methods.  These girls are fun.
Bro, I could’ve went to see them
BRO AT 16:00 THERES A SHADOW FIGURE
the crotch transition went crazy
Idk what it is saying but there's a whisper at 27:30

GYAAAATTTT 41:25
The way I watched it in theaters and then I watched this video💀😭
Love*
Hey sam and colby i live you guys

37:57 demon says hi

One year later and Colby is still obsessed with the backrooms😂😂
I like these two, please bring Rae and Leslie back :)
41:19  Sam: "All five of our phones are right there" My thoughts: There's only 4 of you
I'm sorry, sponsored by Universal?! You guys have truly made it, well done boys.

Do you know what would be good? NOT putting music over the original sound in moments when you claim to hear things. Pls like so they'll see it :)
Please take sambucha on a adventure that would be a insane collab
Nice episode, nice to see one of my fav girl ValkyRae here :) Fuslie ^^ always nice too
38:52 WAS THAT A DUOLINGO SOUND
Those who remember when they played the hosting game in there old house
I wish I could do one of these with y’all love yall
The ones who “debunk” Sam n Colby should go on a ghost hunt with them😭
Anybody else see eyes at the middle right of the screen at time 37:57???
rae is me fr
1:45 colby’s crotch transition 💀
The girl with the white hat is literally giving me a headache. She likes talks 90 miles an hour just hush.
Do you know when you say shush and then listen you’re supposed to like be quiet so we can hear I can’t hear anything except for you guys whispering five of you talking at the same time I can’t even watch this anymore

Did anyone see Colby look behind him when he was at the pool party? 😳
I love how I love horror and and my birthday is January 5
1:03:01 "He stole it." Omg she's talking about the ring he took when he went to identify her body...
1:04:48 i think the other girl couldnt really recieve messeges because she wasnt completely comfortable when her firend was holding her all the time xd
I NEED you guys to collab with Felix and Bangchan from Stray Kids😭
Long time watcher I mean since Vine!!! LMAO!! If you're looking for an amazing place with a pool and that some amazing paranormal activity, that would be Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Eagles Club (The Rave as it is known by the city folk) known for it history of originally being a mafia hang-out spot and some real shady stuff. The place is definitely haunted!! It is now a concert and banquet hall, and I've been there many times for concerts and have experienced some very interesting and unexplainable things. And if that wasn't enough, the cherry on the cake is the Ambassador Hotel. The same kind of stories also connect to the hotel the is adjacent to the venue. The mafia had a huge presence in Milwaukee for a long time in the early 1900s. If this interests you or catches you or Colby's eyes, please reach out, I'd love to tag along and get to experience the best of the paranormal areas of my hometown (and get to chill with the most amazing paranormal creators on YouTube).
Y’all need to collab with kris again like-
I love you guys
y’all should go to riverdale road in colorado. i don’t personally think it’s haunted but there are a lot of stories from the past
sam: I'm a woman. got me rolling and wezing
I see a wire
these girls seem like such nice, honest, positive people. also the way they interact with the spirits shows a lot respect and love (even though its scary as hell). gives me positive vibes just watching the video <3
would you do it with a kpop group called straykids cuz they are really funny and i think they would be really great to do this with

Me if i was there: sure, there's "ghosts" here. Also me if i was there: freaking out over the spiders  "You'd be a great trigger bait for here" sounds creepy. And not scary haunting creep but living man creepy.   If this is all real then someone un curse pearl because she doesn't deserve that
@jynxzi collab with him plsssss
you asked for a name and it said Michea.thenl it mentione noveber,when the wight orb apeared.the gudie had wonderd it it was a guardian angle...maby arc-angle Micheal???

I don't mean to be THAT guy but like, THEY'RE SPONSERED BY UNIVERSAL??? HELLO?????
Coryxkenshin and SupremeFreshMan
Okay, so when they got to the museum and said there were lobotomy tools I kinda did a little "Oooo! Yes!" I fell down the lobotomy rabbit hole of research once and it takes this ice pick thing through your eye socket to sever the frontal lobe of your brain. it was said to cure mental illnesses and neurological disorders. Didn't actually work and gave people all sorts of mental handicaps. thanks for listening to my random lecture, lol.
I mean Hot
Who else thinks Colby is cute
How
I Unclaim all negative energy ✝️✝️

This video scares me the man💀
I watched your guys first video 😂
You guys should ask Brandon Farris and Cameron Domasky!! They are hilarious!! Brandon is scared by everything and Cam is constantly trying not to puke! I'd love to see them attempt ghost hunting 🤣🤣🤣
A short way to say William is will and at 1:02:57 Pearl said will come help me. One of the ghosts is name William just a theory
Can we please stop with the freaked out girls 🤣 it’s good comedy but not good ghost hunting 🤣
HACKS unsubscribe
At 37:58 you can see eyes in the doorway
My theory for 58:07 was that I think carol was Trina say harry was her cousin and Tina was her friend!
WHY IS MY FIRE ALARM RINGING FOR NO REASON?!
leslie and rae are so cute 😭 w collab and very unexpected these collabs are always crazy and using the paranormal as an excuse to take shots is crazy 😭😭

GD!!! 2:46
Can you collaborate with Kelsi Davies
I think I’m seeing things but at 37:53 when they turn in the doorway to the right are those just a glare from the lens or does it look like eyes? It’s like two pairs of white dots one set further back from the other.
I haven't watched a Sam and Colby video in so long but seeing Rae made me watch this lol   Been binging her NoPixel character Ray Mond.
Did anyone else think that when it said Micheal that it was Archangel Micheal because that was honest;y my first thought
MARKIPLIER SEAN BOB AND WADE × SAM AND COLBY NOW BC I WANNA SEE REAL GHOST HUNTING😲
i want to become an influencer for the sole purpose of going on a ghost tour with sam and colby
I need you guys to be with Lauren Z side

Gotta see Jynxzi on here
I love you guys so much your videos are the best and I would love to be in one of your videos in the future I would love to meet you guys and you guys are funny
guys give me your honest opinion, Rae or Leslie
I love how pearls husband was like “you better start  walking back” Sam: “where do you want us to go? Do you not want us here?” “Cause I felt like” got me dying of laughter 😭
Me, my family, and my loved ones DO NOT CLAIM ANY negative energy or spirits from this video. I do not want any of this negativity associated with this video to spread to me or my loved ones. On behalf of everyone that has watched this video or was in the same vicinity as someone or persons watching this video we thank you for sharing your story with us. I am deeply sorry for watching this video and seeing anything I shouldn’t have.
41:46 uhhhhh Colby technically turned round right? (Like look over shoulder etc)
BROO
4:00 Sam’s @zz is infested with spiritual activity *sallie*
Dose nobody notice the two glowing eyes when they started the party
The Mickey house running caught me off guard 😂😂
can we talk about how Rae commented on her vibrator being on when they were talking to Lou in the lobby?
Around 38:06 I saw what looked like a par of eyes in the door way is it just me?
BRO AM OBSESSED WITH YALL ❤🎉
@Mrbeast
Is Sam a boy or a girl you know why he said in the video he is a women
we need sam and colby X insym collab
BRO that's near where i live...
COLBYYYYYY UR FUNHY AF
U should do a collab with the you should know podcast
If i would've started creating YT videos back in 2019 i would've been on one of Sam and Colby's videos by now😞😞😞😞
Take @alexmeyers
44:54 LESLIE SCARED TF OUT OF ME
I hope they get Rae’s friend LilyPichu to do this one day, bc Lily’s a nonbeliever/skeptic
Bro, it looked like Colby saw every single entity in the vicinity at 24:49
What was that in the window 😅
I don’t want to be that person, but I see a lot of misconception go around with the case of John Wayne Gacy (there had been no known murders where Gacy had murdered children in the clown costume, he mostly murdered young adult men that were working for his company) once again, no hate, but just wanted to clear up the misconception about the case. I absolutely adore this video and I’m super excited to see what place they explore next♥️ (edit) Im a complete serial killer nut
I'd love you to bring out keemsama it would be so funy
yall should bring out Coryxkenshin
I would love to go ghost hunting with you guys you should come check out the prison in Santa Fe NM and hotel Blu in Albuquerque the prison multiple people have been attacked by the prisoners that were killed during the riot especially 1 who was tortured alive he attacks females that go there and the hotel people have been driven to commit suicide and jump from the top floor even the security guards that patrol the property are to scared to be alone
Someone tag Markiplier
Did anyone noticevat like 22:15 how like a cat like animal ran behind the girls on like the banister???
Bring back celina and kris. I feel like their reactions, and how they participate are way more authentic!❤
wasnt there a pool in queen mary?
Them speaking of Illinois got me thinking of the mental asylum in southern Illinois where the used to chain people underground. So kawaii~ i get to live near it
Coke or Pepsi??
You guys should do slogo,crainer, and jelly at "The Armory" in Rochester New York
I love Sam and Colby sm been watching them for years! when they didn’t even have a big following or all these brand deals! so proud watching this channel grow! I always worry because I learned that being scared while investigating can cause things to get worse and attachments can be more easily obtained
im watching this in the dark in my room with the lights off, door closed, headphones on. IM SACRED TBH 😂😂
They need to come to New Orleans nothin but paranormal activity, voodoo, hoodoo, all kinds of things!!
Did anyone see the eyes in the door at 37:58 ?
Colby you came to taco bell where my brother works months ago but he didn’t take a picture with you so I wanted to ask you colby?if you could come back so my brother could take a picture?
Sam and Colby I think u should go to the Shrewsbury prison in the UK it haunted I’ve been there before it very worth it
41:38 Colby looks like he’s posing for the cover of Vogue 🤣
AI images.... that's a BIG disappointment from you, guys @samandcolby. You always were quite creative yourselves. Your thorough reasearch (photos, newspaper clippings, portraits) was the thing that made you stand out! And now… is everything just generated? No passion, no truth, no respect for history and those whose life-stories you use. Sad to see how fame and money changes people for the worst. Using AI you're betraying your work, people you work with, your fans and other art makers and creators. Shame. Hope you'll soon grow to realize and understand the problem of using stolen works and become an ally. But for now....good riddance I guess
In the minute 23:47 I swore I heard someone whisper and then I decided to return the video and there is nothing. While watching the video I was alone in my room. I don't know what to think, was I the only one listening to it??
pls come to boston .. and lmk when !!!
You should go to a haunted apartment
I actually watched Night Swim, and it's really good. I got scared a few times, not gonna lie
Me and my family and my loved ones do not claim any negative energy from this video, I'm so sorry if I made any glances I should not have, I'm sorry once again
Giggling girls really doesn't  enhamce these videos.  Talented guys. You don't need this
I  really wish they moved the two chairs that they saw the figures in. im just so curious to see if they disappeared of if they stood up
You should collaborate with some of the boys like Joshdub Eddievr juicyfruitsnacks
omg you guys should go on a ghost hunt with benoftheweekkkk
8:15 was it the shadow that throws rocks at people made that crash sound?
No offence to the ghosts, but imagine if pearl Sans had a cousin named Jewel papyrs

First transition good POV Colby I think the ladies liked it

Is Valkyraes’ name a play on the Norse Valkyrie?
Hahahahahahahahahahaha so funny
I am a ghost
Hey, I watch you guys and the boys. I would love to see a collab with them
16:01 does anyone see the shadow pass by in the middle window? Or is that just her shadow. I can’t tell
Howwww did these girls not know who john wayne gacy was?!
I have a ghost at 7 feet tall. And his name is Frederick and then there's another one that's with my friend. Their name is Tom and they're very tall. The Tom dude is very tall. He's a ghost as well or spirit. He's a thing he's a thing that exists.
15:59 theres a shadow in the window
Those 2 eyes peaking around the corner at 37:57
Did nobody realize in part 55:59 the sentence said “cousin only kept harry”..😭😭

You guys have to make a Video on haunted Clifton Road
go on a adventure with mr.beast
39:55 who saw something
56:51 Okay I never ever comment but I just had to put this out here. My name is Tína and before I even got to this part with the girls I kept thinking that the name Tína would come out in the video. And when it did come out from that device my heart dropped to my stomach and I got cold chills around my body. I checked the websites about this place and there isn't anything mentioning about a Tina. I told my mom about this and she said you are a literal witch 😅
GUYS IDK IF YALL SAW BUT JUST PAUSE AT 37:58 AND LOOK ON THE LEFT SIDE LIKE THATS CRAZY BROO🫥
i i dont think the ghost consider those practice trys with the matches
Colby - uniquely wonderful voice. Get to CNN, Aljezeera ( probably incorrect spelling), BBC.
Wait didn’t the tour guide say at 5:44 that a girl throws rocks at people and at 8:54 you heard a crash could it had been a rock getting thrown at you or something.
Colby reactions are too funny😂
I'm only at 47:18 while writing this, bit maybe the spirit/entity/orb that pushed the guide out of the way was Micheal, and when they said that It might have been a guardian angel I think that the orb was Micheal, and one of the names of an arch angel is Micheal, idk just my thought 🤷‍♂️
I went there about a year ago and there was a room named “Williams room” that was to the right of the pool. During our investigation around 3am when most people left, that was where we had the most activity. I was a semi believer, but after being in Williams Room, I can’t explain the things that happened. It was something the investigators as well have never experienced. I’m surprised Sam and Colby didn’t investigate that room, it was very active when I went.
the hosting game reminds me of the trap house days
Not colby shoving us in his crotch at 1:40 sum 😂💀
Phasmophobia stands for fear of ghosts
Next time they gotta bring Sykkuno.
Collab with Shaun and Jeffrey pleaaeeee 🎉
This group with y’all are way to loud
Bro 20minutes in I see something run at the back on all fours🧟‍♂️
KREW ☺️☺️❤️❤️💕💕👋👋
Can you collab with The Boys it would be hilarious
we're bringing back the 3 am challenges, i see, haha
You should do a video with Matt Rife
When I heard the crash 28:16 I jumped😭😭✋🏽✋🏽
Speaking of mineral water and hotels, there's one suggestion here in Mineral Wells Texas called the Baker hotel which I think you would be really interested in.
I need to see either Coryxkenshin, Flamingo, or Bijuu Mike do this with them
Hey sam and colby. Sorry that i didn't see the video earlier, but i just noticed a shadow. When the tour guide was saying "3" there was a male shadow by the light which then disappeared.
be carful killing those spiders the vegans will get offended
Did you not see someone walk past a window at 16:01
PLEASE TAKE TANA THE VIDEO WOULD BE SO FUNNY AND IMARI
Sam:- Scared af Colby:- Scared af Valkrae:- Scared af Fuslie:- '' I wanna push valkrae in the pool hahaha''
yall have got to take @caspersight on a ghost hunt with you
valkyrae is not nice and 18:43 she give us the finger
idk if it’s just me, but the stick figures looked really creepy, with the way they were moving, like their movements and shit.
You should check out Charleston SC that is truly the most haunted town in America
Ninja
Not the ai photos 😭
markiplier collab with sam and colby would go so hard
Ee Ee Ahh Ahh
All 5 of there phones? There is only 4 or did he just mess up
Have they done a video with Ryan Tryan?
the Aokigahara forest in Japan it is the number 1 haunted place in the world please. PS I love all your videos and everything i just wish I could play who is the murderer or go to pizza night at Sams house.🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
crazy coincidence, at around 58:50 whenever it said “doom” i got an ad and it was about the ‘doomling plushies’ that was the perfect coincidence absolutely astonishing to me. anyway, keep up with the good work love you guys 🫶
Y'all should ask Brittany Broski to do a video with you guys since her mom is a ghost hunter already ❤😇
Rae is honestly pissing me off so bad- seriously why she so dramatic for 💀💀
40:06 HELP THE WAY HE SAID IT 😭😭😭
Y’all should go to sloss furnace in Birmingham Alabama it’s been claimed there ghosts in the tunnels
currently watching this cuddled up on my couch with a blanket in haunted house built in the 1890’s in Alton 🥰 I love my lil Halloween town, I live half a mile from mineral springs hotel! There are MANY things that contribute to the hauntings of Alton, but I believe there’s one particular thing that has brought those hauntings into the homes of our people. During the civil war there was a confederate prison in downtown alton made out of limestone from the bluffs. All of the prisoners contracted small pox and all of the people that didn’t die in the prison (guards and prisoners) were taken to an island on the Mississippi River and left there to die. There were 1,300 soldiers that died in the prison and 3-5,000 people that died on the island which was then named Small Pox Island. The prison was eventually torn down and the bricks were used to build houses and business in the Alton area. So not only do we have the limestone bluffs and the water element for the spiritual realm, we also have homes built out of bricks that are haunted by thousands of dead confederate soldiers. Many houses in the downtown alton area have underground tunnels below the homes, used in the Underground Railroad. We have McPike Mansion which is believed to have roughly 12 different spirits inside the home. Many haunted schools including Milton School. Overall just lots of spooky scary vibes!
😂
F**k yeah
Logan paul
THE HINTS ABOUT THE POOL 😭
37:57 there's literally glowing eyes looking at them in the doorway to the right (the doorway they aren't going thru) 😦
DID YALL SEE THAT PERSON IN THE WINDOW 15:59
Id LOVE to see a collab with @markiplier
Istg I binge watch yalls vids everyday
Omg that was f scary to watch and I was like what the heck is this supposed to be about I just *read more*
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Yo Leslie got everything down like she said the if there are any spirits here please give us a sign
37:57 wtf is standing in the door way
37:55 look at the far right at the other door. I'm not sure if those are eyes, or the light reflecting off the door knob. I think it's a door knob, but who knows?
I just watched the video with the sturniolo triplets and I think you guys should do a vid with them and larray going to fx the Stanley
The water thing is the exact same in my 4th period ppl belive it cure headache hiccups sickness and NY teacher literally made this one kid drink it out of a cup with a rubber band holding a paper towel on top of it telling him to "drink it slowly while imagining a girl jumping over a candle"????? That's some sorcery shit bc it worked
For some reason, this video was giving me not so good vibes. I think it was the guests. I mean I know you guys have other guests in past videos but this one was just very irritating. I felt that you guys weren't being serious enough to actually do the investigation. That's my opinion.
I'm watching this at 12:39 am on the 13th of February, and it's my birthday 😅lol,  I'm planning on binge watching some of your videos for my birthday because you guys make me happy so yeah❤🎉😂 I don't really know why I'm saying this but yeah
Lol how they saw the spider on the door 😂
40:04 a lil bEbE
you guys should check out the monroe house in hartford city
am i the only one who dont like the girls😭 idk just not the vibe
I SWEAR I HEARD ONE OF THE GIRLS SAY "My vibrator is off" AT LIKE 26:30
Rae: do u think it’s a Demon  Sam: ahdtbcshkkudd , non human doesn’t mean DEMON 😈  Got me on the floor 😂😂
Stop feeling bad for your guests they made the choice to join y’all by themselves. They made their bed and they need to lie in it.
My favorite parts  7:04 Colby’s face 😂  29:01 30:13 31:29 32:00 32:38 38:18 40:05 48:36 49:47 51:32
I don’t know why they didn’t mention this or react, but during the Estes method pearl said “He stole it.” Didn’t George ask for her ring form her dead body instead of mourning?
PEARL NEEDS THE RING BACK!!!!!
you should def collab with benoftheweek
The guy looks like Tom Cruise
Can you guys please do a video with the boys
22:25 was so funny 🤣🤣🤣
what i imagain before the vid at the end: colby : REREEE👹😭🤚
33:48 am i trippin or in the window it looked like shadows passing by
The girl with the beaning is really cute
Yo you should take the boys with you
Eddie from pls
I love this video 🎥 but I would love for you guys to do another collab with faze rug
Bro, I was watching and exactly when the camera shutdown all the lights at my house sht down at the same time, creepy AF
i know its bare minimum but THE WAY COLBY IMMEDIATELY ASKED RAE IF SHE WANTED TO TAKE A BREAK WHEN SHE SAID SHE FELT ILL LIKE I KNOW ITS KINDA COMMON SENSE BUT NOT EVERYONE DOES THAT
I am 100/10 a believer because I had a experience with a spirit at my cousin's house   get me to  3000  likes and I will tell the stories about my experience
the lady in blue x the lady in red
Shoutout to these 2 women honestly they banged it much love for them ❤
I've gone there before and my dad told me it was a ghost town and we saw random donkeys and abandoned building it was very scary
Maybe I’m just a super old fan but when yous said yous were playing the hosting game and started inviting all the spirits gave me mega dejavu from when you did it at the trap house
Colby is CORPSE
PLZ DO ONE VIDEO WITH MR BEAST
50:50 The most Leslie thing ever 😭😭 Leslie: We need like physical shield, is there a shield..? Sam: **hands something that is clearly NOT a shield** Leslie: “Oh is that a shield?”
This was funny but a lil boring as well in ghost aspects
WHY DO I ALWAYS WATCH THESE AT NIGHT
In 1:08:49 when they said hey you can heard a women voice saying hey back  😳
Zak Baggans
im genuinely curious if yall could bring a professional tarot reader or pendulum reader into your investigations, im familiar with tarot and ive been learning tarot and from what i understand, they might be a really good way to contact the after life, idk if yall will see this but its an idea
1:00:33 the way he is sitting with his legs open and she’s sitting with her legs crossed is amazing!  edit: guys i mean that you can see the different genders, females cross their legs and men don’t 😭😭
I died laughing when Sam said “ These are bineural beats it’s basically meant to Holy F#%😂!”
41:25 did anyone notice Colby turned around? Even tho he was not supposed to
Tbh I want to see Ranboo and Wilbur! much love and a great video yall
It would be cool if they brought CaRtOoNz
Would love to see @🦋🐉💋Lucid9Angel💋🦋🖤💚Z.T.I on an investigation with you
hi
The flashlight method is so inaccurate. YouTuber John Wolfe proves that too
37:56 green lights In the doorway
i loce you sam and colby i wish could get nerch😅 but my parents dont have any mony😢
this estes method is probably the clearest i’ve seen on this channel in a long time oh my god
I loved night swim it was so good
you need to get caseoh on here
broooooo at 43:25 as you pointed the camera at rea the chair behind her was rocking back and forth
You should do a video with bushwack18
Colby looked behide himself right? 41:50
Please bring them back on!!
Omg I would love to see Driod and Pezzy join y'all.
When they were talking about the name the Alice Box said and the story the guide had told I immediately thought of the name of the angel Michael. I got mad chills
You guys have to collaborate with Markiplier
Sam and colby u need to collab with the boys i think it would be fun
any one notice the figure going on in the window?? 15:58
Would anybody else like to see DashieXP do this 😂
This is creepy and funny
William😂
i wish to one day see slimecicle go to one of theese investigations for real he would make it so funny
SLAUGHTERHOUSE?!
Try to do a Collab with coryxkenshin
The hosting game is giving me nostalgia from the old trap house when Sam done it
yall should go with ravon to go ghost hunting
Bro imagine this without edits it would be like boring but they can edit so good it look so good and good to watch i hope yall post again :))
I love how i already know the rituals from sams personal channel❤
Sponsored by universal they have came so far
Just Sam whenever they hear a noise “hello” and imagine they hear a voice really deep and it says “helllloooooooo” and they all run and scream and Sam gets dragged behind and they never find him again and they go back and they use the estiest method to talk to Sam
Its actually so cool, watching Sam and Colby when they started paranormal stuff doing it illegally to now being sponsored by a big movie production, super proud of you 2🎉
Yesirrr new video
26:39 is where you see a statue of Lord Budhdha. I am so happy to see it since I am a Buddhist ❤
"its basically meant to HOLY FUUUCK" -Sam 2024
22:10 did u guys see that shadow? behind the girls
Off topic, but help and tell me something   When i was in the bathroom brushing i saw something running, it was black, it looked like a black panther, it was really big, it was hiding under my black chair, i cant tell what it was, i couldn't see its face somehow, it was running really fast, just please help and try to think if you know what the mammal/ spirit is!

Maybe I’m getting my period is so real 😭😭
I would like to see Eddie be in this
56:16 @danandphilgames @danielhowell @amazingphil
Okay but can we talk about what a banger that outro song is??
What the f*ck was that at 8:52 had me rolling 😂😂😂😂
I need CourageJD, DrLupo, and TimtheTatman doing one of these.
Maybe when the girls were alone, someone was trying to contact their "friend" "Tina"?
You guys should bring Tara on a ghost hunt
Did anyone else at 37:57 think those were eyes peeking out the other doorway? Just me? Ok
That is how you work a 2man
@theboys
did anyone see when the guide was talking about purl there was a shadow figure 16:00
Coreyxkenshin needs to do a vid with you guys🥰🤭
Pick me I would love to go on a ghost hunt with you 😁
They should have done the same thing to capture that boy in the conjuring but flashed it behind them
Mr. Beast crew would be a crazy video
Anyone else see the shadow in the window ( time stamp 16:00
"A giant shadow figure named William" my mind: William Afton
I recommend Laurenzside for 2024!!!!
I love how they were so respectful <3
God i would pay SOOOO much to go ghosthunting again.. and id pay even more to do it with sam and colby
you guys should collab with benoftheweek it would be awsome
I love how, in every video, they always find a way to include a "small d" joke 🙏💀
At 41:52 i thought I seen something from the night vision camera but it's just a glare from the camera I'm not sure
Please do a video with @LaurenZside!!
Who remembers when S&C called it “seven minutes in hell:(💔😢” say here🙋🏽‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️
You should take Zach justice, Jarred, and Matt Rife pls
Colby immediately asking Valkyrae if she needed a break and seeming genuinely concerned warmed my heart man-
For future content creators to invite on one of your paranormal investigations, I feel like either Jacksepticeye or Dangthat’salongname (Smajor95) would be both great and hilarious at the same time 🤞😂

People who watched this at 3’am
free pearl
I saw yes looking at them before they went in the pool
POST A NEW VID PLEASE
Great video!! I hope you guys go back to the Shanley hotel. Between the brothel and the room where the door slammed shut it would be so cool to see how an investigation goes now after a few years.
0:04 l love them
I'm paranoid.I have the feeling of something making it hotter in my room.
Bro Can Y'all Post Please I Love You Guys❤️😤
Um… anyone else see that thing in the window in pearls room? Ive never in my life EVER felt sick watching one of these videos but this made me immediately panic- and I dont ever scare easy.. baaaaad vibes 😩😂

Me looking for a good video at anytime. Turns 3 am = sam and colby
You guys should do Asylum 49 next. It’s an old hospital in Utah. It’s also known as Old Tooele Hospital. This is just a suggestion. Love your vids❤️❤️
I would piss my pants if someone told me I couldn’t look behind me in a place like this. 💀
So I have a question that doesn’t relate to this video much but do you have any advice for a beginner ghost hunter? I just recently started getting into ghost hunting and it’s because of you guys’ videos! I love your videos and I want to become just like you guys! So please if you have any advice please tell me.
I live in Alton
Them at 9:22 -*hears crash*  scared and then says " Its just the limestone." the spirt that did it be like "Come on now dude you were supposed to be scared."
At 3:54 when they were talking about that girl in black that would appear before accidents gave me Grim Repper vibes for real.
I need these guys to do more investigating in the uk omg 😭😭
Y'all know nothing about john Wayne Gacy. I swear this generation is I was told something or read something on Reddit or twitter and it is fact🤦‍♂️
This is dope as shit
Y’all should visit the Woodruff Fountaine house, it is known for a female spirit, Molly who is kind and active. There is also another spirit, a male and is known for being hostile ( active? )
OMG have you seen the backrooms? This room looks like the backrooms! Oh you mean it looks like the inside of most office buildings....🤦‍♂️
Who came form that tiktok😭
Yo Sam and colby should explore a haunter place live so we can get there actually reaction also i think it would be cool tell me 8f anyone els thinks that to
I could’ve sworn at 34:11 I heard ganstas paradise playing in the background💀
U should totally do the Eloise asylum in Detroit. I’ve been there before! And I took a photo and I saw a girl behind me…. Not a person it was like a figure !
I Am So Excited For The Sturniolo Triplets And  Sam and Colby Crossover 👻
WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE HOTELS DUDE!? I JUST WANNA HAVE A VACATION WITH NO SPIRITS UP MY ASS 😂

Finally a video that i can watch without getting sick!❤ i usually get sick and feel like passing out if i ever watch a Sam and Colby video(even shorts so i have to scroll quick)...idk why but i have guesses and i got too excited bc i realised that 2 days and im going to the cemetery for talk with the ghosts!!❤❤ (im 13 so ig im a young ghost hunter xd) AND PLEASE BRING RANBOO FROM DSMP WITH YOU GUYSSSSS
Sam and Colby I have a place for you guys to go to it’s called Clinton road
Sometimes when I watch your guys' videos I grab my sketchbook and a pen and draw demons and then hangs them up and remember that these are things I've seen there is always this recurring one, it's a white figure with scribbled black eyes and a freaky smile that goes from eye to eye :)
Guys, can you please upload more like I'm worried about you guys.
Hey I'm in LA and I saw Sam's store and bought something and its amazing ❤
58:45 you guys said "you guys had the party down here" and the reply "tomb" meant that that was the room where most of them died and can't leave said room
I love abounded stuff and ghost hunting
Yall should collaborate with Twin Paranormal. I think you guys would have a blast, lol
Can you go to the Chattanooga hotel room 311
A @ajtv

I am not claiming any negative energy from this video and i do not want this spreading to me or my loved ones throughout watching this Thank you so much for listening to our side of the story also i an sincerely sorry if i have any glances i shouldn't have i am sincerely sorry <3
There’s a place , well family land that we’re from . It belongs to my grandma . My uncles have built houses there and there’s A LOT of paranormal activity. Especially legends of Duendes . My little cousin 10 year old just went and was playing soccer and he saw something . I would love to have you guys do an investigation. Especially knowing how attracted some family members are to spirits and other stuff . They attract so much and the land itself has lots of activities.
Do these guys ever catch real evidence of ghosts? Or is it always the bare minimum of activity lol..
Y’all should collab with Markiplier.
HELP WHEN THEY WERE AT THE POOL WHEN THE RADIO SAID MICHEAL AND DECOMPOSE I THOUGHT ABOUT MICHEAL AFTON😭
Collab with LOFE!
Do a collab with LOFE
Hello that gurl
U should collaborate with lazarbeam
Sam when colby is explaining the water he is sitting there mewing

You will be hearing from my lawyer

Can you team up with Sherman and investigate his apartment.
YOU GUYS WERE MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD AND I MOVED N MISSED U GUYS😭😭😭
Can't wait for the next video 😁
What happend to you
I hate guests like Valkyrae & Fuslie. They claim to not believe in deamon/spirits but bail out when they come across a slight sign of paranormal presence
Y aren't y'all dropping any videos on a weekly basis anymore?? Y'all don't even drop them on a monthly basis anymore! I absolutely love yall but I'm telling you I'm about to unsubscribe because what's the point in following you & subscribing if y'all are not going to drop any content, what's the point??
ii watched the movie when it came out in the cinema but the trailer made it look mid asf but it was actually so good so don't be fooled
When colby said" nothings wrong with small thing."actually.... what is samll ? 😏😏😏
ok guys i was always afriad of ghost till i saw you guys im still afraid but you guys inspier me
They brought back the hosting game, feels like trap house vid again
This was one of my favorites. The girls reactions were great and they were respectful. I don’t like it when the guests taunt. I like the surprises that you guys kept putting them through. ❤❤❤
People that think same and Colby should start a gaming channel👇
GUYS YOU SHOULD DO A INVESTIGATION WITH @iShowSpeed
Ho Lee Fuk That Was Worth My One Hour And eight minutes, (Your Content Is Amazing keep the work up!)
When’s the next video?
It sounds more like Willam Afton
when's the next video coming guys??😭😭😭 I've been waiting for over a month🥲
Damn the man behind the slaughter chilling at the pool. 7 foot? Hit me up babe;)😘😏        Ok sorry if i made anyone cringe😭😂 and size don't matter babes😌
Colby looked behind at 41:49😮😮
The only thing i see was how cool you guys are and how hot colby wass
I SAW THE POST AND SO SAD I WASNT THERE IVE BEEN ON THIS GHOST TOUR BEFORE AND IM SAD I COULDNT MEET THEM
once i walked in an abandoned building…                    i heard a scream and walked straight out the door, my friends stayed in there and broke their arm 👍👍👍
good idea is to get the guys from the netflix movie supernautural
I miss when they would post a lot it's been a month sense they posted they used to post every week or 2
37:57 wtf is there in the right down corner there
Why they don’t post anymore :(
Sam when you were around the purple lights in swimming pool, you turned around😨😨
I live in Alton and it it’s really badly haunted
I am also going to a bridge where goat man is said to cross.
This was a great video. I am going to be going to the most haunted motel in the world they say. I am little nervous and will be making a video .
In the pool one of the spirit said Michael, Michael is the spirit that throws rocks
Hi I hope you have a great time here in Australia for as I will be waiting for the video I wish I could say hello in person but sadly I can't but I wish I could goodbye
I no joke see ghosts, so whenever I’m scared I watch Sam and Colby and for some unknown reason it makes me feel better, I think it’s because I know that there are people who believe and experience the paranormal like me. I’ll explain the ghost thing on my channel so if Sam and Colby want to watch it you can so you know what the actual heck I’m going through. But I have to make the video first because I JUST made my channel. But I still wanna say, thank you Sam and Colby for keeping me sane with your silly jokes and cool investigations! I do really enjoy this channel and I think it’s officially been a year or two of me being here!
You should do more stuff with Bella poarch and Larray they’re super funny
i laugh so hard every time colby says bébé i legit can’t stop laughing
anyone else remember when sam did the hosting game back at the trap house??
Why did I think it was William Afton 😭, I mean he is tall and his name is William!
"No one turn around."  Colby 5 mins later turning around to look at the stairs 🧍
I can’t help but think when Colby said “He stole it” at 1:03:01. Pearl was referencing him taking her ring when identifying her body
sam and colby please notice me , you guys helped me bond more with my dad and share something we have in common, which is watching you guys. please like my comment it would mean a lot.
Sam and Colby it would make me really happy if you invited funneh and the krew on one of your adventures🙏🏻
I want to go on a ghost hunt because I can see and talk to ghost same with my older brother who's name is also Sam
Yall on tubi tv
Poor Pearl :(
Boy it was a great idea to watch this at 2am😀
BEEN WATCHIN SINCE VINEEE still love y’all so much. My get away during anytime. Never give up  Also stuniolo triplets collab let’s make it happen
you guys should do a colab with twin parranparanorrmal i'd watch that :]
You guys should do a colab with Markiplier it would be so cool!
Please send another video I love your videos❤❤❤❤❤  😊
Is this the only comment that i know they got arrested and Sam was bailed out?
You guys should try Edd &Loraine's 28 day method to further investigate haunted locations
Check the window at 16:00
I will understand if you don’t pick me but I what you guys to go to the hotel cecil
At  22:12 you can see something run behide the girl in green..

37:58 look at the big opening there is two glowing eyes
Hey same and Colby I love your stuff am 13 my name is Nolan I would love to maybe be in a video with you if that’s ok
53:17 years old my firsts 🎉

you guys are my fav i love spooky stuff
Sam and Colby you guys are my favorite Youtubers i hope i can meet you guys and the rest of the group someday😊❤
16:00 look in the middle of mirror
Can you guys go to the amittyville horror house next?
The girls 😮😢😨😰  The boys 🕺💃 ty for 11 million subs
I love Sam and Colby and believe most videos are true but because they said people live there in the apartments upstairs, it’s easy to debunk most of the bangs and steps. I’m sure the tenants mess with people
Coby: Aw shit the cops scram 43:52
I was watching this upstairs in a room in my grandmas house and when he was talking about pearl my light flickered 😅
This is how i keep going instead of doing SH,watching ur vids. Tysm <3
BRO I LIVE IN Illinois
I told ya, shit gonna go downhill bc of the spirits. Wrong move bros, hope all is well
Hey 😄 I was just watching "haunted towns" and they stopped by a place in Oregon, Pendleton. I think you should go over there and check out the tunnels. Set up cameras all around, because you will probably see shadows and hear voices when you are there. It would be awsome! 👻
Do you hear me
Uhhh, guys what's that in the dark with two lights on the right side at 37:57 ?!!!!!😨
i hope you see this massge and to this video
and go there and a ghost hunthing video
its a real life story and screir
but can you do a  favor to wach ia wujud
sam and colby i love your video
Why is no one talking about something moving in the window at 16:01 ? Bc wtf was that
why do they take so long to post mane 🐒
you guys should invite the ha sisters
Has to be an AA meeting in Pearls room. The two drunks up there for sure.
Found your page a few weeks ago and took me about as long to watch almost every video LOL. Thank you both for doing the work you’re doing—it’s as brave as it is important. I’ve had my share of paranormal experiences in the past 1-2 years (unfortunately related to loosing people near and dear to me), and content like yours really helps me feel less crazy. You both put your souls and your health on the line for this content, and if you ever see this, I hope you know that people me me and many others can empathize with how deep this stuff can cut. I’ve seen been so entertained and inspired watching your channel, and can’t wait to see what you do in the future! Much love ❤
I going to sue if u don’t start posting again
Waiting for beta squad with yall!
IT TAKES A BIG CPURAGE FOR ME A LESS THAN 14 YEAR OLD TO ATLEAST GO INTO A DARK PLACE AND YALL OUTHERE LOOKING AT BKACK FIGURES AWH HELL NSUR (bad spelling I know)
Btw love your vids!
If you do recommendations for where to go I think y'all should go to ponca theater in Oklahoma!
In the time of 15:58 you can see something fly passed the window which it looks like an angle
You guys should explore Pea Ridge Mine near Sulivan Missouri.
INVITE Tarayummy and Kennedy Walsh NEXT!!
SAMMy boy & COLEY boy can you guys go to the hever castle in England?
Sam and colby, i need to know. After i get freaked out, i hear a loud ringing in my ear! I think i can communicate with goasts and some of my nightmare's tell me what happens to me the next day. Please, i know, busy. im not trying to annoy you, but i want to know. Also, at night, i look like im just different. My eyes are just scary! Thank you even if you dont respond.
Guys yall are getting to old and yall are not making not that much videos 😢😢
FINALLY THEY POSTED
I love you video of colby brock and Sam golbach is my favourite on YouTube wen are  you coming to Australia to the Geelong jail from brittaney geelong Victoria
The contrast of colby and leslies voice though
I like how you guys made a vid about breaking up 7yrs ago and here you are❤❤❤❤
8:54 it looked like he turned before the noise even came…🌚
1:46 Colby casually making us face plant into his crotch
What’s happening did y’all stop being friends
When are you going to post a new vid
Sam and Colby. Please don't leave us, we need you. You are mine and many others comfort to reality.
YOU SHOULD DO AN INVESTIGATION WITH KAGE! HE'S A VTUBER! I just found out that he loves you guys and as been watching for a long while!
When are you two going to grow up abit? Been waiting a few years now for a more calm approche to your hunts. I mean your both still good but like man .... The constant shouting, laughing, imature noises.... When your late 20s i reckon you will be better then ghost adventures.
Sam being unable to light a match was honestly a kinda terrifying but funny moment in this lmaooo
Go to a grave yard at 12:00am at night.
I would like to see pokimane and eddievr ghost hunt
have you seen Sam
Alton Illinois my hometown! I can't believe I missed you guys.
I find that they editorialize a lot of there answers when doing the Estes method.  I have no doubt that have had real encounters.  But I don’t agree with the assumptions they make in most investigations
@samandcoby Hey guys awesome videos i hope some day i could be like you guys and go exploring im not that brave but it sounds fun and it would be an interesting experience❤😊
Bro my mom saw me watching this and said "TheSE GuYS hAVe POTTY MOUTHS I dOnT lIKe ThIS" 😭💀
Y’all should buy the haunted monkey doll
Rae was so funny. Balled up with the visitation game
Do a callab with Eddie pls bro
i wach you viddeos and i liked just be carefool and safe
Can you explore the teke teke
It would be funny if Sam and Colby brought Faulty and Frenchrxses onto the channel, they do bloxburg (Roblox) content but in a recent video they mentioned Sam and Colby. If they brought them onto the channel there would sure be a lot of screams 🤣
I wish I can get that merch but I’m in England 😢😭😭
I had once woken up in the middle of the night when I was about 4 or so, and started screaming, my brother woke up startled and my mother ran into the room, I told her I saw a man and my brother had a scratch on his back that wasn't there before, my mother had once done something wrong when she went to summon spirits and then the spirits had gone after her,   Two years ago, as usual, I looked into my brother's room and saw another man, his name is Hatman, im still scared of him till this day, especialy when i get to know that others has seen him 2
You guy so loud lmao but I lovvveeee love you guys content this is the best paranormal investigation channel ever !
STOP SHIPING THEM THEY DONT LIKE IT STOP
Hes hot ❤❤
SAM IS SO HOT BUT COLBY THO😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰

From someone who lives near here, I’ve been here and it is the most eeriest building you will ever walk into, some of the building has shops in it like a store called Raining Zen that sells crystals and things of that sort. When you walk past raining zen and more into the building the air feels different and truly the scariest place I’ve ever seen.

While you guys were in Alton, IL.... you should have checked out the McPike Mansion. It has LOTS of haunted history also.   Ive visited it and it was an interesting location
"A long time ago, one day, one of the families living on Goed ter Walle, the smallest child became ill. It suddenly started crying loudly and kept crying. The farmer and his wife no longer knew what to do and, on the advice of the pastor, they sought help from the Norbertine fathers in Drongen. They quickly realized the seriousness of the matter and immediately sent two monks to Poesele. Praying loudly, they walked through the farm house from the cellars to the attic and sprinkled all the rooms with palm branches soaked in holy water. When this was unsuccessful, they started praying again while examining the house from head to toe. In the basement they stopped in front of a linen cupboard and in one of the top drawers they found an unknown rag doll with three pins inside. When they took it out of the doll in prayer, the child stopped crying and gradually recovered."  an old story from belgium
Please make more videos I’ve seen like all of them and idk what to watch

WILLIAM THE MAN BEHIND SLOTER
i know y'all will probably not do this, but i think it would be cool if you brought fans on these trips every once in a while. i kinda feel like bringing random fans would do a better job of convincing people that this is real, which i know is why you do it in the first place. bringing celebrities almost gives the message that you are just doing it for views imo. i honestly believe most of the stuff i see in these videos is real, so i dont mean to hate, but having a big name like valkyrae or georgenotfound or wilbursoot in your videos just kinda boosts view count more than anything. having random viewers come on might help alleviate that, i think. oh also i am suggesting this partly because i want to be one of those fans you bring lol
Sam & Colby taught me that not all ghosts are bad, but I´m still afraid of the images they randomly put in their videos. Also here is a "list" of people I really want to see in your videos Philza, Quackity, Tubbo, Slimecicle, Ranboo and TinaKitten
Sam and Colby…. POST!!! I check your channel every day! Also love u guys haha, yall are truly amazing!
I was scrolling on YouTube shorts and uhm do y’all do remember when you did the grind on me thing-
You should do a collab with Preston arsement and his wife brianna arsement❤️   👇🏼People who agree

yo whens is yolls next post
Are you afraid of the dark made me scared of pools a loooongggg time ago lol. Now my fear is going to get reignited…thanks LOL
DUDE SAM AND COLBY YOU HAVE TO COME TO MY SCHOOL ITS HAUNTED AS HELL  Back then the building of the topic was a nuns home. I think maybe 3 or more lived there.  My teacher just told my class another one of the horror story’s of the school  She said: One of the faculty staff came to the school one night bc a police officer called her to come bc of a 911 call. They went around the school and saved the most haunted part last. They didn’t find anyone  though. They finally went to the most haunted part and the school. The police officer was to scarred to go upstairs bc it was the most haunted part so the faculty staff came with him. But still, nobody was found. So they tracked down the call number and apparently it was the number they used back when the building was first built. In the 1940s  Another one she said today was:  When the gym was first built, my teacher and another teacher were in the kitchen part of the gym. They were by the door and looked back at the kitchen. My teacher said that they both saw the sink fosset move.  One that everyone heard of in my grade heard: One of another faculty member ( just call her Mrs p ) went to Leave the haunted building where the nuns used to live. As she was stepping out she felt someone push her to where she fell to the ground. She looked back and saw no one. And no one was even at the school.  Now the final one that had been recently from only 2 years ago: 2 years ago we had a festival. One of the rides was called the X-men. You basically was facing the haunted building and went in circles. A few kids went on it and saw one of the most famous nuns that haunted the building the most in the window. They said she had her mouth open REAAAAAL wide and had black eyes. Idk what happened after that but Ik it’s scary.  There is prob hundreds of more that U can figure out and that idk about. And by the way, the reason why it’s probably so haunted is bc there is a freaking cemetery behind it.  I hope you respond I ❤ U SAME AND COLBY
YOU GUYS SHOULD GO TO BANFF SPRING IN ALBERTA
I love you guys you put all your effort into each and every single one of your videos thank you❤️🖤👻
What was that movement in the covered window behind the girls and the chair at close to 16 mins? Anyone else see that?
DO MORE VIDS    1:17
Sam and colby love you guys sm❤ but I'm suggesting if it's possible to do a video with the boys? Or just Eddie vr only if it is possible, but it would be fun. Again, I love you guys ❤
21:10      AYOOOOO MY NAME IS CHARLIE😃 im gonna die at a bar👍 but im a girl.......
When will you guys post again? I can't wait for your new video
I’m waiting for them to post lol can’t wait for the next video
Did anyone noticed the eyes? Or just me..? 37:55 is where I see them, on thr right corner of the door you can see two white dots as if someone or something was watching them do the matches
I don't know how to personally message you guys ......but I would really appreciate it if you investigated my childhood home. It's abandoned and my grandma had an exorcism in that home not to mention everything I've seen happen there and I went back to just visit and I got a sick and very bad feeling. I would like to tell you the whole story. It tore our family apart after my stepdad read from a satanic bible and a holy Bible at the same time. Respond to this message and I'll give you the info. It's in Hartford ark. --If you want my info then just say OK ..IK it's hard to send info without others seeing it. But I really want you to investigate my childhood home that's abandoned
You guys should come to Maryland
see, things like this would shake me to my core. recently, i've been experiencing quite a bit paranormal activity, consisting of voices, things in the corner of my eyes or noises that shouldn't be there. i may just be crazy or things are happening.  so everytime it's an unwanted or an unknown spirit (there's a 57 man that died in 1956 in our house. it was renovated, but both me and my brother have confirmed seeing things out of the ordinary, or as people would call it, paranormal.  so anytime there's an unwanted/ unknown spirit, to cope and not get too scared, i started to say "wowee butterscotch! 😱" and it makes me laugh everytime. is this disrespectful or something else?
The fact that Universal sponsored you-
I went to that hotel for a family reunion once and I think my stepfather got possessed that one night
CRYING BECAUSE UNIVERSAL STUDIOS?!?!?

OMG colby's eyes are so pretty!!!!!!
Me and my friends at school tried to talk to a spirit. We took a hula hoop and placed it down and got in a circle, we found out that the spirts name is Suesan and they dies from being shot sometime in the 1700's. We asked if there was anyone other spirts there twice once they said 10 but then they said 15. One of my friends also felt like something went through them. The only thing that im wondering is if its real? Anyway, any advice??
LIKE if you are a simp or fan girl/boy
I am sorry but the eyes in the shadows of the doors- 37:58

as a fan i don't believe in ghost, but i would like to experience something like that
I just wanted to say that Sam and colby have always helped me through rough times and that I just love their videos
Okay, I'm a skeptical believer, but I have to say with the SLS and the chairs I could definitely see it picking up the shape of the chairs and mapping a figure. Like, just devil's advocate over here. It could also be ghosts too, I can't prove it either way but I still think it's plausible to just be the shape of the chairs tricking the SLS.
I saw eyes when you guys were walking out of the door after the hosting game
People who love god can like this comment an sam and colby
Watching this I felt uneasy 😬
Pls take Brittney broski! Plssss

When are you going to upload again
I think it would be funny to see the scary game squad go ghost hunting with Sam and Colby 😂 @JesseCox
Y’all need to go to the Inunaki village
That ending song sounds amazing
Am I the only one who thinks with the estes method it was Pearl speaking through Colby, not the other way round? Especially the "there was no option" sounds more like her not having another way out than death, not like him not having a choice in beating his wife... But also things like "he doesn't care" or "revenge", like maybe she was the one who cursed them both so now she can make him suffer like she had to suffer when alive.
Sam Colby why haven’t you posted it’s been 1 month
Hey sam and colby I did was had scary moment one time I was in my room then I heard a sound it sound like "shhhhhhh" I freaked out and then I ask my brother "Did you say shhhhhh " and my brother said "No I didnt" on that day I didnt sleep
Sam and Colby and Kris and Salene…y’all’s should do an investigation at the gypse rose Blanchard house for DD!!!! Please????
I know nothing about like the history or anything but I think it'd be really cool if you did a collab or something with kelsi davies, shes a medium/psychic and she's really funcand i think you guys would have a great time together ❤
Can you go to the Devils Tree?
@angryginge13
Cassie, the little girl who drowned was having her birthday party. You mentioned cupcakes and the word “sharing” came up and the rem pod went off 🥺 around a minute or so before 47:00

Ghosts are afraid of drunk people. Grew up in a weird house. As in weird stuff happening. Whenever we got drunk the place was normal as can be. Stay safe people. Drink brandy

The way colby nods at the guide near the start, like it looks like he doesn’t understand anything 😂❤
37:58 is this glare or 2 pairs of eyes watching them? Correct me if I'm wrong
Dear Sam and Colby I'm a big fan I love your videos but you guys should post a little more on your regular page  because life's lame with out sam and Colby  and we wait like a month or two I hope you see this and mabey consider this keep grinding

You should visit Susanville ca. it was founded during the wagon trail during America’s manifest destiny period. Then it was a prominent logger town with surrounding towns actually being corporates owned towns like Westwood and Chester. There are many haunted buildings and mines here and even an old county hospital that has been abandoned and is said to be haunted. And episode of abandoned and afraid did an episode here on the shadow man. Would love to see more paranormal investigators take a look because I am too afraid. I won’t even try the Alice app in my 1930 home.
Yo at 41.53 Sam fully turned to look behind him when they said not to do that during the hour

The Ghost House of Rondebosch  Jac Loopuyt House, also known as The Ghost House of Rondebosch, is a picturesque Edwardian residence nicknamed “The Spook House”. It is rumoured that a strange cult resided there in the 1970’s and there are stories of doors being opened and closed inexplicably and a transparent elderly man wandering around.
The Ghost of Verlatenbosch is an enduring tale set on Table Mountain. It is said that a governor of Cape Town made an enemy of a citizen. The citizen came up with a dark plan: he gave the governor’s son a beautiful flute as a gift. Unbeknownst to the governor or his son, the flute was once owned by a leper. Within days of the son playing his flute, he became ill. He was forced into exile in a lonely hut at on the mountain, where he played his flute until he died. Some say on a still evening in the forest, you can still hear his mournful tune today.
Hi you guys are awesome.How about you guys go to the most haunted place in Cape Town?

Before I ask something I’m a huge fan and supporter and I love ur content and Sam and Colby y’all both have inspired me I’m so many ways that I can’t even think of and I would love to see a video on the Murdoch murders in Wilmington, South Carolina it’s about a crime that happened in a house and ever since it’s been renovated to people and know barley anyone wants to renovate it out because they hear the maid that died in the house screaming and crying but just an idea don’t know if you will read my comment but I hope u do I love your content ❤
YOUR TELLING ME YOU WERE IN ILLINOIS!!!!!!
When are you guys going to post a new video 😢
I wonder what would happen if two people tried the estes method  at the same time, would they hear the same things?
40:05 ”BéBé” Colby Brock
If you can please stop talking negative about and people who practice Wicca I have been practicing Wicca for over 20 years and your negativity towards towards people who are witches like myself I find highly offensive people who practice Wicca or witches do not sacrifice animals we do not believe in harm to anyone we worship nature and believe that you should not harm as well wiccans and witches do not believe in the devil even exists we believe that the only evil exists is in the the hearts of humans so sacrificing animals and stuff like that is against what we believe as well anyone so please if you can please do not talk negative about people who practice quicker or which is anymore
watching your guys’s videos completely changed my life. i look at life way differently than i did before. im so much happier and im spreading so much love<3 i love you guys so much:)
I just got merch🥳🥳🥳
i just went to the theaters to watch night swim and it was amazing i mean ive seen more scary than that but its great but also depressing
Sam and Colby one of my best friends said that you should make a video with Charlie Slimecicle. But it's okay if it does not happen. If you see this, please like it or reply. Please and thank you.
night swim was an amazing movie
You guys should go to skin Walker Ranch
I am a hour and 25 minutes away from there in Springfield IL me and my sister wanna come do a video with you guys we really want to and we hope so cause we contact ghosts without knowing sometimes and I'm a 10/10 believer of the paranormal
At 16:00 anyone else see the figure in the window??
I feel like you guys always cut the Estes method so short
Did yall see that to?
Try to get red night vision goggles, military banned them for reasons of seeing demons. Think it would be cool?

Hey Colby I’ve been feeling a pain in my right ball and I’m scared to tell anyone about it I feel embarrassed and idk what to do or how to tell my mom I’m terrified I’m thinking of worst case and I’ve been freaking out for two days
patiently waiting for the vid wit the sturniolo triplets
You should try and get ryan trahan to do this with you
Hi

I honestly want to see JackCepticEye do this 😂😂
Leslie panicking because she thought she heard something 😢  Sam and colby: I wanna thank everyone for supporting are channel 😂
No my old house is because one night my dad could see a figure walking around the room so he grabbed his shotgun and was ready but no one was there also another night our tv turned on by itself at full blast and another night my dad could see a girl looking him dead in the eyes screaming at him and I swear on my life this is true
Can you guys do a video with I showspeed please it would be hilarious
Sam colby look at minute 16:00 look at the sheet behind the girl with the beanie can you see that shadow
I would love to see Ranboo in a video with Tommyinit, two of my favorite people, it would be so chaotic <3
So I’ve had multiple experiences with “spirits” and I’m not a very firm believer but about 7 years ago I used a Ouija board and it counted down from 10 and I just put the board up and said nothing and I’ve had a scar on my chest like a giant claw mark and I’ve had multiple mediums tell me there’s nothing that they can do and that I’m stuck with it and just recently I’ve had it to the point where I’m seeing it more and more and it grabbed me from the back of my head where it covered my eyes and I couldn’t see I’m currently try to get rid of whatever it is and you videos have helped a lot with try to see what it wants   Side note: I’ve had multiple people around me die after the incident and my life took a turn for the worst after that point I’m not lying I’ve had 7 people I know friends or family die 3 therapists die 1 from a heart attack 1 from suicide and 1 from a car crash
wait is it just me or did it look like colby looked behind him

✨”NaMEd WilLiEm”✨, Colby Brock 2024
Dear Sam and Colby, I am a medium from Colorado, me and my friend group have recently been to the Stanley and we believe we have picked up Sallie from the Sallie house due to the vortex in the Stanley. Last night I had a vision Sallie came up to me a mentioned you guys, she told me “Sam and Colby safe.” I would just like to say you guys have been a huge inspiration for my friend group and we hope to meet you guys one day.
I think that mark and jack should go with same and Colby!!
With all the experience you guys have. You might as well just become like Ed and Lorraine Warren. Investigate cases if people reach out to you.

Sam and Colby X Smosh collab!?!?!
I would like to come ghost hunting
30:55 that pic is so AI
Illinois is literally my home and I can’t even imagine it having hunted places
The Mineral Springs is an amazing place. I live outside Alton. What you don't know is there is actually a second pool. It is smaller and was for the men only. You passed the entrance on your way down to the slaughterhouse. You guys should come back. There are more haunted places in Alton than nonhaunter places.
Why did I find it so funny when they were talking about party’s and cupcakes the rempod next to the little girls stuff who died on her birthday went off and sam just said “want a shot?”💀💀💀
I need you to post
I wanna see Sam’s and Colby do an investigation with Markiplier,Bob,and wade
me at wingstop watching and getting scared while i eat 😭ipad kid type shit
Sexton house is not very popular, but is known to be haunted. It’s in a small town in Russellville, ky. 🤠🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣
hey sam and colby please post more (I know its hard) your are my fav scary youtuber
oh and my name is jackson
hi i am on my moms account and i have whached your vids you guys are great 😀😃😀😀😀😀
The times 22:13 or 22:14 u can see something move really fast behind them in what I think is the bar,what is that?
This video remind me of this story about my school (yes, it’s true) : a long time ago in the 20th century my school had a pool because swimming was an optional sport. On a weekend, two kids snuck into the school and were playing in the pool and the top closed and trapped them under. They were stuck the entire weekend and the janitor found their bodies when school started. It’s so sad but also makes me wonder if there are spirits around me school.
Try the ganzfeld experiment while someone does Estes method.
I’M SO MAD I LIVE I  ALTON AND I WENT THERE THE DAY AFTER THEY WENT SHSBSHSBDIWBS
Does anyone see anything they missed?
HOW COME YOU STILL HAVE NOT WENT TO THE MOST HAUNTED CATACOMBS YET WINE YOU WENT TO THE LONGEST CATACOMB YOU SAID AT 300,000 LIKES YOU WOULD GO TO THE MOST HAUNTED CATACOMB IN THE WORLD AND THAT VIDEO HAS LIKE 418K LIKES AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T GONE THERE WHY!! 😡😡😡😡
Mrbeast should join them sometime
I am not lying but today i saw the old videos of yours and at night i felt shadows walking past my room and heard the voice of my parents talking but when i asked them they were asleep at that time
People who watched him silence 4 years or higher 👇🏻
Take the boys with y’all pls I’m begging 🙏
Y’all should do a collab with the boys and I’m saying for you to definitely go collab with Eddievr

IVE SPENT DAYS finding story’s an information about this place for you guys please please just give me a reply
The Virginia House was built in 1873 and fully renovated in 1987 and is on the list of Virginia’s Historic Places. While there are no sleeping rooms in The Virginia House, there are ample meeting spaces for groups of all sizes.  History  The medicinal waters and the curative powers of the numerous springs in and around Orkney Springs have brought travelers to this quaint Virginia village at the foot of the Great North Mountain since the early nineteeth century. In the 1850’s the Orkney Springs Hotel began its construction and the main facility, The Virginia House was completed in 1873. With its white clapboard structure and tall, green-shuttered windows, The Virginia House is four stories high. The 96,000 square-foot building includes a 5,000 square foot Ball Room, a forty foot by one hundred fifty foot dining hall and numerous small meeting and break out rooms.   In 1979 Shrine Mont purchased the Orkney Springs Hotel and the surrounding 1,000 acres of land and restored the facility in 1987. At that time the common areas, meeting rooms and dining facilities were renovated.  Today more than 15,000 people pass through the Shrine Mont Conference Center each year.  The First Floor  The first floor contains the lobby and front desk, the gift shop & bookstore and administrative offices.  Download a floor plan of The Virginia House first floor.  The Second Floor  The Ladies Parlor is located on the second floor. This space is 40 feet by 50 feet and can comfortably seat 100 people as a meeting space or for a reception. There are six additional rooms for small group meetings. Each can seat ten people comfortably.  The second floor also contains a dining hall that can seat up to 300 people. Guests who stay in—— GO SAM AND COLBY PLEASE
ITS USED TO BE A SMALL TOWN AN NOW ITS A HOTEL SPOT WITH OLDDDD HOMES
SAM COLBY , I CANT STOP UNTIL YOU GUYS GO THERE !
I’m going to shrine Mont to do my own investigation, I’ll be the first person to investigate it but I’m not gonna get as much as you guys could capture there so please please please put it on your list 💯💯💯

Sam and Colby needs to go in Indonesia and get one of those spiritual people that always has so many rings on their fingers, necklaces, a stick or sword and so on. I'm curious what those people can do. If Sam and Colby had a friend like that, it would be awesome to bring that person to all the haunted places in America.
They should do to the ostrich Inn, that’s in England find some stuff there
U guys should go to the manger hotel in downtown San Antonio Texas
Colby:Named william  Me: WILLIAM AFTON!
You should collab with Laurenzside I think it would be really fun 😃
Anyone else notice that colby turned around while calling Cassie 💀
You guys should investigate the hell house in Gary Indiana, I feel like you guys should get really good footage.
You guys should do Bobby Mackeys bar. I have seen so many investigators do it they always get something.
I do not claim any negative energy from watching this video.
Thare ar eyes in the hallway at 37:57
Do a Collab with Mr.beast RIGHT NOW!!!
All these haunted exploring got boring me unless you yourself is there to explore then yea it was cool when you guys were doing it at first but now it’s overrated
2 years ago,you two told us that you both will to to the suicide forest together. When will you both gonna goo!!!!!
Hey Sam and Colby the conjuring house was very emotional and very enjoyable to watch and I hope you brothers stay safe
I LIVE THERE🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥 tbh I grew up in alton and the mcpike mansion is such an interesting place to visit. And the bluffs are so pretty. I also love mineral springs. It’s so pretty if you don’t think to much into the history. And if you didn’t go to just deserts you missed out lol
IM SO PISSED YALL WERE ONLY 35 MINUTES AWAY FROM ME AND DIDNT SAY ANYTHING 😭 like y’all I have been waiting to meet you for YEARS now and I had the chance but you kept it a secret you were so close to me. Im crying 😭
Could you guys please visit Massachusetts again? It would be a dream to meet you
I dare you to play cat scratch (how to play: You sit down on the floor, your friend lies down on the floor with their head in your lap. Everyone else sits around in a circle. You rub the person's temples in a soothing motion as you tell them scary stories about a cat. The story: There once was an old lady who owned a cat. The cat was very nice. It meowed and purred. One day, the cat got hit by a car and died. Cat scratch, cat scratch, cat scratch. The old lady got a new cat. The cat was very mean. It hissed and clawed. Cat scratch, cat scratch, cat scratch. One day, the cat got hit by a car and died. The old lady decided not to get anymore cats. Cat scratch, cat scratch, cat scratch.) and your supposed to get cat scratches along your back but you won’t feel anything 😊
I wanna see @boze
Are you guys at lv I think I might have seen seen you guye
i do not claim any negative energy from this video
Hey Sam and Colby, I wanted to say thank you and I mean THANK YOU! You guys are a blessing because I used to struggle wiht $h since I was 8-13 and I am now 13 and I have stopped $h and my mental health is so much bette now because of you guys,I really feel like you guy’s videos made an effect on me, they gave me motivation to get out of bed, clean, go to school, get better grades and just do better over all.

37:55
You should go to the area that was once the residence of Sharon Tate where the Manson family broke in and killed everyone it’s located in LA however the address has changed and the original property was demolished and a new residency was built in its place
Y’all on your next ghost adventure go to the Sharon Tate house in Los Angeles CA I don’t know if y’all will be able to because in 1994 they tore down the property and built a new one on it but basically 6 people were murdered a mother, her unborn child, her 18 year old and three guests in 1969. Have fun
Just an fyi… alcohol is used to conjure spirits and demons… I have a spell book and found that out in it
When u wer taking about the woman in blue I saw a shadow on the window I’m not joking it was a shadow and it was outside the window 😮❤ please someone just look at the windows when the talks about the woman in blue I was so scared for them ❤😢😊
I’ve got a question. What are the two animals in the doorway when you are leaving after the matches? 😀
when i was around 5 i seen a spirit and my dad and his girlfriend seen it all the time. The building was a flower shop on bottom and 2 apartments on top and it would go from the neighbors apartment and then into the kitchen of our apartment then into the living room then down a long hall way into a closet at the end of the hallway and my dads room was right next to the door. I used to sleep with my parents around age 5 so i was in his bed and around 2:30am i woke up and looked around and i seen something in the door way so i wiped my eyes and looked again it was still there so i woke my dad and he jus said go to sleep so i did but it was like 6ft tall and it had a large top had and the whole thing looked fuzzy but i later asked my dad around age 11 and we weren’t living there anymore and he told me what he had seen and that i described him the same way he seen it.
i fucking love this channel

And it's not a joke i just want you guys to be safe and please don't go back to the enchanted forest it just gives me a creepy energy like if i felt it inside of me so i just want you guys to be safe and don't go back please
Hi sam and Colby hopefully you see this but after the enchanted forest video i started feeling uneasy and my mind started thinking about going to that enchanted forest and doing rituals in the middle of the woods or in the ritual cave and i had a dream that you guys were the victims o fthe cult i just wanted to let you know don't go back Because they are waiting for you....
Mr.beast
Please look at 10:04 or 10:05 please Sam and Colby please
Can you guys do a video on The Banff springs hotel ? So many story’s so interesting. I would love a video on it.  Optional: You can do it with Celina and Kris
I heard a girl scream go to 10:05 or 10:04 I’m so scared
foony joke
that one transition we go into colbys crotch 😳
I would or could be in the basement alone and the pool
who else misses them doing this but just them exploring
Fuslie: “ I think your lying” Sam: OOO DRAMAAAAA
Best collaboration in my opinion is Markiplier, TX2 Evan! ❤✌ Lobe you guys and all you do for us!
I just love Sam and colby :)
You should go to Canewdon church in England
Look ty sm for every single thing you guys saved me you're the only one I still trust ❤
Go to latvia their are many haunted places in latvia!
You guys should Fairmont Banff Springs in Alberta
The police is coming, but you again
you should take ishowspeed on a adventure or kai cenat another suggestions is chunkz
When the spiritbox thing said "michael" I was thinking about archangel micheal and that he might protected the people from the collapsing wall? Idk but that is just what popped up in my mind
Imagine if they would go to investigate Kurt Cobain’s old house since people think it’s haunted💀  I swear i sharted so bad when watching this video😀
you guys should try going to the amity house
Markiplier ghost hunts with Sam and Colby or we riot!  By we I mean me. Im kinda small so not really a threatening riot. NONETHELESS MARKIPLIER FOR GHOSTS!!!!!   anyone know how to tag youtubers im a super noob..😬😊
Bro, you guys need to bring Samantha Eve on one of your ghost hunts I just feel like it would be really funny ❤❤
Where is that haunted hotel from that video Lisa
It was a bad idea to watch this with a loose tooth.
I keep seeing black shadows in my school and the son of the principle said that there was a huge tree and there was a white ghost and in one room i keep seeing the black shadows plus there was a bathroom and was a scary room.
Sam I have seen all of your videos and all of the things that you have been doing there’s a spirit that I don’t know his name but will one day he will do something wrong with you and your friends in camera
Honestly we need to get smt straight. It’s called Sam AND Colby for a reason. Sam is underrated. I’ve saw way too many people only talking about Colby while Sam just doesn’t get brought up. They are both equally good.
Look in the door frame at the right at 37:57 theres eyes.

37:55 if you look at the right you can see a pair of white eyes and if you zoom in enough you can see the outlines of a head
Sam and Colby never fails to entertain Us love you guys......
The other question I have for sam is  Why does it feel like he has a new little girl ghost up his ass every week
the reason the water makes you feel better is because you're convincing your brain thinking your healed when really..you arent

Hello Sam and coby How would u like to get locations for abandoned buildings. I shall give the most known here WARNING ALL BUILDINGS ARE IN THE NETHERLANDS: we’ve got the entire abandoned neighborhood and milk factory (all on one street but these will be destroyed and the neighborhood is already getting destroyed) in Arnhem next to the John frost brige, red and blue office buildings next to the GelreDome these buildings are all very close to each other in the same area, other places that are further away are the stone factory in Velp (only one camera) and castle Almere. I love u guys and your content that’s why I’m willing to share my knowledge of abandoned buildings here in the Netherlands. ❤
Like if Sam and Colby should play Phasmophobia.
Sam and Colby you guys should Collab with flamingo!!! Please love ur vids!
This is a perfect video to watch before bed as someone who is terrified of ghosts and is easily scared!  Side note: I have not watched the conjuring as I do have a little bit of grace on myself
I have the same name as Rae i thought the whole time i was being called. and the concussion thing is on point its so easy to get one i feel.

We are in the end of times. Repent of your sins and turn to Jesus while there is still time. Jesus IS THE ONLY WAY as it states in the Holy Bible to receive eternal life. The signs are all here that He states in the Holy Bible. Pray, fast and serve others. In Romans, believe in your heart that Jesus is the Son of GOD and He died for your sins and rose on the third day and you will be saved. Return to GOD, The Only True GOD, The Creator of Heaven and earth. We are not promised another day on this earth. I'm here for any prayers.GOD bless you. Jesus loves you enough to give us time to turn to Him.

It would be cool if you could ghost hunt Auschwitz’s I’m not sure if that’s aloud but probably would be a crazy investigation
37:58 if you look closely to the door on the right, you can see two glowing eyes in the door!!
Btw this game me chills
Yoooo my hometown
HERE'S A FACT !. LIMESTONE HOLDS NO ENERGY AND IS ONE OF THE WEAKEST ROCKS ON EARTH. GRANITE ROCK HOLDS ENERGY AND ALL LAYLINES ARE MADE OF GRANITE !. IF YOU WENT TO SCHOOL YOU WOULD KNOW THIS.

Anyone else dying for a Sam and Colby Rhett and Link video ?? I wanna see that investigation ❤❤❤❤
I love these videos I just wish we would get more of the estes method. It always feels like they get cut off just when they're getting good.
Duddeee this is so close to where I live
I know what you got to talking about because I live in that area
There were two pairs of eyes at 37:57  …
30:36
Can I go on a scary video
OMG, I love you guys. You are absolutely amazing, but I have something to say every since I moved into this house a few years ago. I've constantly felt like I've had  to look over my shoulder, and there have been nights where I cry myself to sleep because I'll be laying in my bed it's maybe 12 am and right next to me on my bed side I hear my name  or breathing on my neck and everyone in my house is dead asleep I've tried to communicate with what is here but I didn't get a clear answer I also don't have a lot of tools to communicate with them and I hear foot steps down my hallway they go down one way and don't go back the other I could be paranoid or I've been right and my house is really haunted. It's actually so scary 😭😭
Are you guys going to do a collab with the boys?
I'm not sure if it's just me but I found out I can see and communicate with ghost at the age 11. I love your videos Sam and Colby
Uiom
You guys should go to clark air base hospital
Hey! I'm a new sub and I really Really like y'all's videos!! I get the goosebumps every time I watch one of y'all's videos they're just amazing! And last thing I would really like to see y'all do a ghost hunt with Kelsi Davies, she's a really nice person. She's friends with Amanda too so yea!
17 is such an important number when Seth is on any mission, they should break down 17 and see what number it is in numerology because i think Seth is 8, which is a very powerful number
i feel with colbys deep voice when they do the estes method its scarier when he replies lol
I saw during the hosting game thre were eyes in the door way
Create
UNIVERSAL WTF I DIDNT KNOW THEY SPONSOR YTBERS
My grandma lives in Illinois
I think there might be something they didn’t catch—they were talking using the Alice box a bit earlier in the video, then when they sent the girls downstairs—they said that the figure who throws rocks’ name might be Michael…just something I had noticed…
13:55 "Maybe my period's coming I'm not sure-" I feel ya girly. I feel ya.
you should go to anywhere in Appalachia, there are so many stories of unexplainable and paranormal things happening. I've lived here my whole life and I've heard and seen things that I can't explain.
25:16 I'm just saving the time
the way that everytime they got scared sam and leslie would hold eachothers arms and make little screams during the spirit box was so cute
Maybe Carol is the spirit, Harry is Carols cousin, and Tina is Carols friend?
Did yall die why aren't you posting😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I have a question. Have you ever been attacked by a spirit before?
Ok, story time because i wonder if other people experience this:  Ever since i moved in, there has been activity. However, this past week has been crazy. I even have sound recordings of some of the main problems as proof.  There has been some sort of demonic creature wandering back and forth in my hallways every night for the past week. It takes long light steps, but it almost sounds like muffled hooves with a heel walking. It seems to be real interested in me as it is constantly wandering outside my door and scratching on it. On top of that, it has been banging something metallic together or something. I even heard it talk, saying something like: "Boys....all rotting" I have no idea what to do...   Help...
I would love D’Aydrian Harding plzzz this would be so fun with his friend Sammy
You should try to get Shelby on for an investigation she said she would in one of her livestreams
Where have Sam and Colby gone ? Anyone know if they’re okay ? ❤
Did anyone else see eyes that disappeared
You guys should reinvestigate with Kris and Selena. I think there will be a different investigation.
rae: “DUDE HE THROWS ROCKS?!” leslie: “i’m cool with lou 😎”
You should Xplore "Americas Bloodies Tunnel!!" I've seen things in there!
Sam and Colby look like a guys who one day stop uploading, got missing and never hear about them again or get some strange last upload and that's it. Just mystery and if we lucky then they appears in other body's but real fans can tell that they are them.
This girls are so fucking annoying....kind o ruined the whole video
i did not like the words coming through during the party in the pool, some of the most disturbing things spirits have said.
Surprised they havent gone to bäckaskog castle in sweden fhey literally have ghost horses
If sam and colby were to go anywhere its not well known or atleast but zvikov castle in czech republic more or less the towers there is a demonic imp in the towers
Just a question: anywhere I can get a REM Pod or equipment for the Estes Method? I wanna do some investigations of my own, but wanna make sure I don't buy something that won't work effectively Love these videos so much and helped me to believe more in the paranormal
I really enjoy watching you guys, me and my friends started to investigate  the paranormal because you guys
there are eyes looking at them on the right 37:55😨😨😨
You guys should come to the haunted abandoned kempton park hospital in South Africa :)
Hey Sam and Colby I wanted to mention a spot in Indiana that you could do some research on that might have potential for videos its called Allison Mansion here's a little thing I found on the internet "Sources may be a little girl who was visiting and drowned in the basement pool"
Sam and Colby, I want you to go to England and explore Harry castle if you don’t know who is harry, Harry got six wife and they are divorced, beheaded, died and divorce, beheaded, survived.

Hi Sam and Colby I was wondering if you were up for trying a couple haunted hotels in San Antonio I have a few for you to try, the Emily Morgan hotel, The  Menger hotel, and the Crockett hotel. I believe the Menger hotel is  one of the most haunted out of the three. I hope you consider coming @samandcolby

I could have met you but I was not there
You should do a video with Kelsi divis she does ghost hunting to

Please posttt
"Whatever you do, don't turn around." ...Colby turning around in the pool 41:50 lol   Absolutely LOVE you guys!!!
I love uou guys but John Wayne gacey didnt kill in the clown costume or lure ppl under his house. Tho that is a common like misconception😭😭 he js worked as a clown but he lured people from being an owner of a KFC and his construction company. He had parties with his KFC employees in his basement and would assault the young men. When he started working in construction his killings got more and more and he hid them under his house. But he was a huge part of his community and would dress as a clown for kids parties but attempted to rape 1 person in his clown costume. Sorry I’m a true crime addict 😭
There's a hunting playground near me
I am not claiming any negative energy from this video, and I do not want this spreading to me nor my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you so much for listening to our side of the story, also I am sincerely sorry if I had made any glances I shouldn’t have, I am sincerely sorry!
Go back to the Stanley hotel
Is there any way Me and possibly other people could do one with y'all somewhere close to Dallas Fort Worth Area
1:00:34 the one on the right (red chair) is sitting with his/her legs crossed lol
You guys should do a collab with Kelsi Davies!!
22:15 me thinking there was an apparition but it was just a car driving by lmfao😂😭
You are only 2 hours away!(reply if I could come on a trip with you guys lol)
WE NEED A THE BOYS AND SAM AND COLBY COLLAB PLEASSSSSSSEEEEEEE!!!!!!
I made an edits of Sam and Colby and it was my first video to go viral      Love Sam and Colby’s video
Hey Sam and Colby. I've been watching y'all for a while now and I really enjoy your videos. I found you through CelinaSpookyboo and Kallmekris. I live in a small town in Washington State  but about 3ish hours north of me, is the city of Port Townsend. There is a pretty well known haunted hotel there called the Manresa Castle Hotel. My parents stayed there about 13 years ago and my mother had a very cOlOrFuL experience, you could say. For this reason, my brother and I have been wanting to check it out for a while. I'd like you to please consider this location for one of your upcoming videos. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Y'all have a wonderful day. Stay safe, -E
56:09 I was waiting to hear a scream from the girls
Seeing Julien Solomita doing an investigation with you guys would be a dream come true
the boys josh, mully, narator take them with you Please
We need a vid with kris and Niki together
Hey ik you’ll never see this text but if you do there’s this method of a séance  and it’s called table turning I really don’t know if it works and would like to see you guys try it not saying you have to. Just thought it would be cool to see you guys try it @samandcolby
yall need to react to the man behind you in the conjuring pt 3
I will not take any negative energy from this video or have it reach out to anyone who has seen this video, and thank you for sharing your story with us, we are really grateful
Damn Rae is hot!!

Pinefm and Siri
Who thinks Sam and Colby should explor a church and camp inside
you guys should go to the poltergeist house in poland
Is it safe to look in Peggy eyes I don't mean no harm
Try Bhangadh Fort of Rajasthan in India
They should go to that haunted house in poland that’s called the exorcist house
Don't overstay your welcome
Bro i got auto backed from this vid like my phone reacted on its on and the lights flashed on my phone I think my phone got haunted from colbys demons in every hole (I'm serious)
It's crazy that me and my buddy have been going to abandoned buildings just for fun for the last 6 years and thinking that people are doing it on YouTube and making millions of dollars a year while I did it for free....😐😐😐
@kyphes
Idk why but o cryer myself to sleep because I wanted to meet Sam and Colby.
Ive worked as Front Desk and general staff supervisor for a hotel for over 2 years. It isnt a bad hotel nor run down and super cheap, but even with that I can say deaths and extreme situations at hotels are way more common than you'd think. You're trained to know how to handle things with the least amount of other guests knowing and quick cover-ups. Relatively newer hotel i think it's only 20 or so years old,  but it's seen its fair share of death. All the staff have experienced paranormal stuff,  and it has attracted quite a few psychics. The behind the scenes of hotels is crazy.
my bff she recommended this channel,and it’s the first time I’m interested in haunted houses video. It’s the best haunted channel I ever watched.
OMG CAN U COLLAB W DANTDM?!?!?!?
47:12 The second they mention the stream the gears start turning inside of Fuslie’s head.
I just have to tell Y’all that I tried the Estes method because of you guys, I’m a medium and my and my friends have seen “things” in their woods so we tried the Estes method and we figured out that it was a little girl named Emily that got killed in the woods by their neighbor! (He went to prison but got back out and is now living in the same house that he killed in!) Lol after that note…I love you guys Videos, Onward and Upward🖤🖤
Oh, sorry, my spider from my bathroom came to visit you! (Joke)
Imagine if they turn around they heads what will happen?
You should invite the sturniolo triplet!!! 🙏<3
them : * *scared of spiders* * also them : * *goes to the most haunted town in america* *
You guys should go to Willow weep
Can't wait for 2024 adventures! ❤  I DO NOT claim any negative energy or entities from this video. I do not want this to be spreading to any of my family friends and anybody that knows me. Thank you for listening to me and I sincerely and whole heartedly apologize for any glances and looks I have made. I sincerely DO NOT  claim anything bad or any bad intents. I DO NOT ALLOW any spirits or entities to pass through my phone or any device to harm, attach, and follow me, my family, my friends, and my pets.
I’m not sure if you’re able to visit this property but a video on the amityville house would be so cool!!!
37:57 I see eyes on the right side of the room peaking from the doorway.
Bro @markiplier needs to do a ghost hunt😂
At 16:01 you  see a person or a shadow moving that just creep me out a lot.
That Estes method was awesome!!!!!
Waiting for the new video pookie😍😍
Hi Sam and Colby I love your videos and I think you need to make one with the people call the boys let's just say they made friend's with the demon in the conjuring house basement 🏠I need to see you all in a video 😂
You guys should go to the Glensheen Mansion in Duluth Minnesota, it’s super haunted. Two women were murdered, one was suffocated with a satin pillow and her nurse was beaten to death by a candlestick. This all happened on June 27th 1977
Sam and Colby have taught me not to be afraid of ghosts, but to be afraid of the random pictures they put in there videos  (Holy im famous)

try to get markiplayer
@samandcolby I have been wanting to see a video on the McKamey manor
I been there! Fun fact, a guide my group had, said that one of the times he was leading another group and then went underground to show where underground tunnels were, and where people hid at to escape back in its appropriate time. One of the girls in the group he was leading said she felt scared, and they feed off of that he said. After, she suddenly gained a blank expression, walked out of the small tunnel where her tour was happening, and went in a corner to the entrance of the cave, he asked if she was okay and she let out a demonic scream and passed out. Afterwards he told my group that she turned out fine. It’s been 3 years since I’ve been there, and 6 years since this event happened.
Please bring along Ryan and Shane. And Markiplier, Bob, and Wade.

I would be cool to see these guys check out Sloss Furnace in Birmingham, AL. Apparently it's super haunted and seems like it would be cool for them to investigate.
I need you sam and Colby I had come across a real devil on the 1st of November I was at Milor adventure camp SA and I was looking outside the window and I see a white 3 meter long and wide smile looking at me coming as close as it could until I took a flashlight and flashed it on it and it diserpered like it was scared of light 💡 I need you too come and chase this negative energy away from my family. I call it the smile man.

fun story my dad worked in that town for his company for a few weeks and stayed in a hotel that was haunted. the building him and co workers were fixing up and working on was also extremely haunted. they would see shadow figures and a lot of the time were working in the dark. He made me promise to never visit that town due to something that happened to him that he refused to tell me.
y'all should do a video with twin paranormal.

Guys do live stream 🔥🔥to prove non believers wrong
Nice video as always! You guys should visit  The Fortress Hohensalzburg in Austria, Salzburg. I never rlly visited there but i've heard many things about it! (Btw, Austria is in Europe and its a country beside Germany. The language is German.)   Small imformation: There are not too many spots in Salzburg, from where the 11th-century-fortress cannot be seen. For a long time, it was the residence of Salzburg's archbishops and as you can imagine the scene of many historical events. Many a prisoner had to languish in its dungeons. The most well-known of them probably being Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, who had fallen from grace and had to face the end of his life in imprisonment. Hohensalzburg is known as one of the largest castles in Europe and as this building has had a great deal of influence on the city and its surroundings, so it also has become the scenery of many of Salzburg's legends. Who haunts the place? No castle would be complete without her: The White Lady. The one in Salzburg's fortress is described as a beautiful woman, who walks the courtyards and halls of the castle at nights, dressed in a flowing white robe. Time and time again she appeared – preferably in full-moon-nights – for announcing tragic and disastrous events. Even the brave night watches of the castle met her with a lot of respect. If you want to spot her nowadays, you have to be more attentive. Since they started the electric illumination of the Fortress Hohensalzburg at night, sightings of the White Lady have unfortunately decreased. But when the fortress is shrouded in mist in many a chilly night in November, she might sometimes show herself very briefly.  Ideas:  The fortress can comfortably be reached by funicular. If you prefer to walk, you will near the fortress after a short and steep walk uphill, while being rewarded with great views of the old town area. There are a few different museums and exhibitions inside the fortress, so make sure to also have enough time for your visit.
Would be so cool if they came to Australia and did a haunted tour here😮
15:16 yall, am i the only one who noticed an orb pop on the screen and suddenly dissapear again?
Gday, I heard you are coming to Australia, and was wondering if you would like to come to a haunted old jail in South Australia where people have spotted many ghosts, and you are allowed to stay overnight, reply to this message if you want to come. Cya

Maybe a bit off-topic, but about 2 years ago, when I was getting ready for school, I saw probably the worst thing you can see. So just as I was ready to leave, I remembered that I needed to take some more headphones, so I went back to my room, and when I walked in on a chair that was facing me, there was a black figure, and instead of a head, it had a skull, but not a human skull, but an animal.Such a deer can be said so to speak, I'm not entirely sure, but it completely made me nervous. It took me 5 minutes to get my act together. And so I generally live in a block of flats next to the forest and I always have a strange feeling about this forest, I have only gone there once in my whole life. And in general, I've seen characters for most of my life, now it's kind of stopped. P.S. I haven't tried anything demonic, of course I'm interested in such things.    PS. I'm 14 years old this  👍Thanks for listening 😊
Idea for 2024: why not make a collab with a YT group called 'The Boys' (Narrator, Eddie, Juicy, Josh, Mully)?
I’d love for you to bring Toast somewhere.
I love u guys I ar thw best u help me a lot ❤ I love u❤❤❤keep up with good work

You guys are so funny
You guys need to go to the blackwell ghost house 🏠
you guys should go to Hoia-Baciu Forest Romania apprently it has the most paranomal activity
You guys kind of played a mexican game call "No Mires Atras" but you guys played it differently. ✌
Colby turned around💀
16:00 Did yall not see that shadow cuz i did and it looks like a ghost going up i might be wrong but it does look like a shadow of a human or ghost 😅
wanted to say and tell abt my story  of creepy things that happen to me this has 3 storys that happen to me  if you don't feel like reading this copy and paste it and then put it in the translator and then listen to it so obviously it was a Halloween night I was just chilling and getting ready to go trick-or-treating so when we were about to go I was missing one thing for my costume not to mention we have a basement so it was in the basement and I went to go get it and just to let you know I am a little bit underage not going to actually tell my age as a lot of creeps are on here anyway I went down in the basement and I used to have this thing called  American Girl doll so once I went down there  the American Girl doll was at the bottom of the step  I thought it was weird so me and my cousin threw it in the corner where the laundry was now after I got the thing that I needed for my costume we went out came back about an hour later because it was pretty cold I went back in the basement because I forgot something down there when we went trick-or-treating and the crazy thing is we have another area on the other side which is the right side our laundry room is on the left side so I want to go to the right side because that's where I left it and the doll was literally sitting in the corner with spider webs on it no our basement is pretty old because this house is centuries old probably stuff like that so I was confused on how a spider can make a web that fast it's either we have a haunted house which we probably do have because we do have a pretty kind ghost and I'm pretty sure that he wouldn't hurt us anyway I saw it and I told my cousin to come down and take a look at it right after that I realized my cross was missing obviously I'm not Christian or any other religion I just have a cross we do have a Bible just in case because this house is definitely years old so there could be some ghosts here after that I realized the cross was on the doll i got so  terrified that day yes this is a true story and I would not lie about something like this as it's honestly crazy  let's get on with my second story 2nd story: this was not too long ago as I think this was like about a week ago my cousin was over at my house because we feel like we're sisters and she doesn't live too far away from me so she usually comes over a few times anyway we were just sitting downstairs because we like to sleep in the living room as my  cousin does not like my  bright ass L e d  lights anyway we were sitting downstairs and all of a sudden my cousin said did you hear that and I was so confused I was like no I didn't hear crap because we had the TV on I was watching a video she was also on her phone so I wasn't paying much attention to really anything so she said she heard a meow  and I told her the crazy thing was I heard that same exact noise a few months ago but there is no cat in the basement as my dad checked a couple months ago so right after we went to go to the basement door and that's exactly where she heard it so we were just sitting there being confused and we were stupid so we obviously said hello nothing came up but a couple minutes later we were still at the door just talking and being confused right after we heard of freaking hiss and I was just freaked out so I have a cross and it was upstairs in my room so we were going to go get it I obviously want to be a ghost hunters so I have I have to have the equipment and everything but I do have a cross as in my last story I just told after that I was too scared to go alone because I am afraid of a lot of stuff let's start with being alone I am absolutely afraid of being alone after that we both went upstairs and we got my cross and then after we went back to the basement door and started talking I said nothing absolutely nothing can hurt us if you are here to hurt us get the freak out of our house because you are not welcome to your and you were never welcomed here  after that I was just so freaked out after that we opened up the basement door and we turned on the light my cousin went to go down there to check there was nothing freaking out there I checked out in the front yard like I actually opened up the door and went out and looked everywhere nothing was there coincidence I don't think so maybe this could be a skinwalker but I'm not trying to think of that 3rd story:  this happened on my uncle's house the story was not mine it is my mother's now we stayed at my uncle's place because my mom and dad was fighting  so I would sleep in the guest bedroom he also lives in a  apartment so it was obviously again a Halloween night we were going trick-or-treating because there was nothing that we could physically do as it was pretty late at night and we didn't go trick-or-treating because it was raining so we just went home and went to sleep my mom obviously stayed up she was a big book reader so she reads a lot of books she was reading a book it was late at night obviously I just said that and she says she swears to God she saw a face peeking out not to mention my uncle goes to work at night time he comes back at 7 a.m. she said it was an  White face after she told me that i was so scared i wad like wtf!? Thats all hope you enjoyed my scary ass storys💀
Wish it was celina 😔
And I think more commentary is needed here. This is looking more like a party than a ghost hunt. And it is truly sad that they are consuming alcohol because it gradually degrades their quality of life and health. At least they are letting everybody know by doing it in their videos. That way people will know about it and pray for them. This is the worst ghost hunting video I've seen. Silly ganes detract from the ambience of the environment. And I think the hobby is messing with their minds. And Actually haunting isn't real. Its imaginary and somewhat popular The bad part is that the false paradigm messes with oeiokes' minds and worldview. Its okay to enjoy spooky places, but don't have false beliefs. I'm putting a like on this video because I love watghing them. But I;m still sad about their false belief and self-harming of drinking alcohol. If Sam an Colby want to be safe against Satan and other demons, They need to reject Hollywood and their sponsoring to promote Hollywood's satanic material. Satan runs Hollywood and the big Hollywood bosses require a people tp make a pledge to Satan in order to get big contracts. Sam and Colby are harming their own minds with their false beliefs and ritual games. Again, I am sad for them all. I think the guide made the story about the orb up to embellish that he didn't have people stand where the wall collapsed. People haves fatal accidents every day and orbs of light aren't saving them by pushing them out of the way. There wasn't any spirit conversation in the estes method  The individual comuterized estes boxes make up slightly different responses to questions. They make up their own responses  Spirits don't talk in thim. And the Alice Box also makes up its own computerized answers too. And the SLS only records temperature comtrasts between objects and displays them as stick figures because its designed to produce stick figure displays.
I do not allow negative energy to follow me throughout my life or my loved onces as I watch this video, I apologize if I had seen some things that you did not want me to dear spirits.❤❤
You should bring unspeakable and his crew on a trip cos he doesn’t believe in gosts
I love you all. alot of you dont want to believe or are on the fence about it. But out of my life, I can truly say Jesus Has healed my anxiety, depression, loneliness, and just has been helping me get my life together. Jesus is waiting on you to call out to Him. Also I want to tell you the Big bad word of repent, it just means to turn away.  Repent(turn away) from sins and believe in Jesus Christ God bless you all.  Deuteronomy 4:29 - But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved
I know I’m gonna be the only one in this but I miss the paranormal vids like the Sally house and VIllisca house where you guys went and filmed and made it spooky and too the point instead of making it theater and light hearted. It takes the scary out and it doesn’t really keep my attention if you guys find something. I stopped watching instead I just watch the older ones. Just my opinion I wish y’all the best!
I died at Colby’s turn when Sam said “Yo, what the fuck?”
Ty Sam and colby for not quitting like most youtubers are, you made my year and many years to come and you made me  believe in spirits a lot more, thank you so much

I cant go a month without seeing shit going on in my house. And i got woken up twice one of them more memorable which was a thursday night went to bed at 1:30 am. I heard a distorted sound from my radio inside my head and my auntie telling me to get ready for school while i heard people outside my room. It felt off dressing up and i was hella tired. I checked outside my room nothing looked at my radio 2 am. I went back to bed thankfully and didnt take my medication. The only thing i seen one day coming home, i took the key to open the door due to my parents not being home. And i looked in the mirror cause its right there and a split second i saw this 7 foot guy who was hiding behind the white pillar in a hoodie with a hat and a jean denim vest. He was much taller than myself.
You guys should go back!!!!
Please bring Daz again
Y’all need to check out the Read House in Chattanooga TN for haunted room 311
@TheBoys
Dang, hosting game is a blast from the past lol! Also when I saw Rae and Leslie in the title my first thought was let's see how long it takes for phasmophobia to come up 😂
Sam is the basic white girl of the horror movie when he says hello to noises
SAM COLBY HAVE U SEEN BEVERLY HALLS YOU SHOULD RLLY GO THERE AND LOOK WHAT THAT STATUE IS ABT.. COULD I GET A PIN?
Did anyone else think when the ghosts said Tina they might have meant Rae’s and Leslie’s friend Tina?
You guys look so stiff XD
HAVE YOU GUYS EVER WANT TO SKIN WALKER RANCH
Colby looked behind him..
@sturniolotriplets have to  Collab
I’m a professional researcher, so just as a note, listening to binaural beats doesn’t actually work/have the effect it’s supposed to unless you are listening to them through headphones.
Colby! Come to Australia with Sam and see the koalas! There so cute!
I know you don’t know me and I doubt you will see this but please whatever you’re doing be careful I just woke up this morning with the image in my mind of Colby surrounded by darkness and covered in blood staring in terror at what I do not know and felt like I needed to put this here
Not bean mean or anything but they are a lot shorter than I thought :/
Weird question but colby do u still vape?
Can yall please collab with homonica!!!
need another FaZe Rug collab!🙏🏼
I love the store in the same building as this place and I go to therapy a few blocks away
You guys should have zack justice and Jared come ghost hunting
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!! Also I totally think that you amazing people should totally collab  with the dropouts podcast! Love your work!
Im so happy to see Rae and Leslie. They are so hilarious. The synergy  is too  goo between  them
10 % investigation .... 90 % drama ....  why dont you guys team up with other paranormal investigators ..... please not with any random youtubers ..... you guys are really on the verge of being professionals now ..... this is like clueless random teens doing shit they dont know vibe
taking unserious dumb people with you on the investigation ruins all the fun .....  Why dont you guys give all the guests a prep about what to do what not to do ?
When will we see more Celina and Kris without y’all ?
i don’t allow negative energy or sprits to come around me and to follow me or the people I love or my best friends  throughout I watch this. I am very sorry if I looked at anything that u felt uncomfortable with. I should’ve have not done it I am very sorry. And I respect
Heyyy me and my bestfriend have made a channel and we had also sent you a message on instagram and would love to hear from you guys hope you have a good day!!!❤❤❤
Did anyone else see the eyes in the dark

Aokigahara Forest 😨 suicide forest 🌳 camp a weekend…
I learned that it’s was said that Franklin D Roosevelt had polio and he would use the springwater to exercise and everybody thought like it cured polio so that’s why they would use spring water to swim
Hey Sam & Colby can you please go to ellsworth ks abandon hospital 😊😊😊😊
Y'all are amazing I have lived in Alton my entire life and it's so cool to see you guys in my hometown.
Sam, colby I beg you guys to colab with markiplier and jacksepticeye also go to Bolsover castle it's the most haunted one and have a haunted teddy that's locked in a case and rumours of a little boy running around 😊
I don't know if anybody else notice this. But after the Alice box said Micheal and then starts talking about the event that happen with tour guy, something clicked in my head. What if the thing that prevented harm coming toward the tour group was an angel. One of God's angel is named Micheal. And it would make sense that it does not want to talk much, because it doesn't like them messing with things that they shouldn't mess with. I'm not 100% sure, but it my guess to what it could be.
COLLAB WITH CORPSE
LEWIS GALE COLLAB!!!!!!
Hey Sam and Colby! I've been watching y'all for the past year and it's safe to say I might be getting some of your merch if my dad buys me a hoodie.  I am obsessed with the paranormal now because of y'all and you guys helped me through the hardest time of my life. I lost my mammaw the 28th of this month 4 years ago.

Ya'll need to address how KallmeKris just admitted to you getting scammed at the Conjuring house. I don't feel like watching your videos anymore. It's too sketchy. You need to come clean.
The “spirit on your back” thing in the hosting event made me think of having a Nezuko on your back 😂
Hi can you please a do a  video with heart rate monitor to see who gets more scared! I would appreciate it a ton!
COOL BUT WHY U GUYS NEED SO LONG TO POST IM LOOKING EVERYDAY AT THE CHANNEL PLS POST FASTER😢
That is so cool

Omg hiiii I’ve been your fan for ages but Uhm I’ve only got YouTube a couple days ago so yea anyway love ur videos❤
Y’all should look up haunted Macomb il and check out some spot I love the super 8 spot cause the oakwood cemetery next to it and known to have  in photo ghost there to and apparently like half the collage and beside spring lakes all haunted to we got some pretty good little haunted spot but I think some should put there foot down and investigate those spot
The fact my name is charlie
I just got to say Sam you and Kris are ment for each other!🍑🍌🍆
Hi I really love your videos and You guys just make my day whenever I’m sad or not feeling good I just watch your videos and I’m such a big fan.ps love kailee.
1:04:41 did you notice the two clung onto each other? 😂
@samandcolby y’all should look into Ms McGavock at the Opry Mills mall in Nashville Tennessee. She died in 1965 and gave up her property to the church where the mall sits, her wishes were disrespected and they built a theme park that got shut down in 99 and now it’s the mall. Someone this past week just took a picture in the malls movie theater and caught a full entity behind them. Supposedly the mall stores always have things fly off the shelves and they open the stores with things mysteriously on the floor
I have an idea where you guys can go next if you go to Kansas and go onto the military base there are houses there that are extremely haunted and it’s like as soon as you get in there you will see those houses on Fort Riley
I know a fun game you can play at home. Get a baby doll and go into the bathroom and place it in the tub. Then say “baby doll 1 ,baby doll 2,baby doll 3” then go run and quickly find a hiding spot. You cannot hide with someone else you had to hide separately. After staying in your spot for five minutes go into the bathroom and if the doll ain’t there you have to find her in less than five minutes. If you don’t find her your house will be haunted until you try again the next day at midnight. You have to start the game at midnight and everyone in the house will have to play if they don’t want to play then they have to exit the house. And after you say baby doll 1 etc turn off all the bathroom lights.
I do not claim any bad energy
I swear if I ever accidentally scare Sam or Colby and Sam says hello, I’ll say “Hola Ninios”
Pls go to a haunted hotel with ishowspeed
I would like to see you guys do a vid with the boys
Happy 5 year anniversary of your arrest!

This might be the most funeist horror video 😂😂😂
Oddly Rae and I have the same birthday (Jan 8th) and I noticed that she had what seemed to be stronger experiences, I myself have had a vast array of paranormal experiences ever since I was little. I was born with what my family calls “the gift of sight”. I find that really interesting.
Mor ghost Vito please 🙏
dude awesome video .......i would so freaking cool u guys and collab with THE BOYS channel  <3
I wanna see y’all with ha sisters it would be so funny
I hope i am not the only one who doesn't believe in ghost's but still is somehow scared of this video🥲
Is it just me but did I just saw glowing eyes when they go out after lighting the match?
No because it's the way I'd love to go do these videos with you guys but I know I'd probably chicken out when the wind blows too hard or something not scary happens.🤣😭😭
I WANT THE AGGRESSIVE HI GUYS IT'S SAM AND COLBY NOW.
OMG i absolutely loved this video, so epic. i would love to see markiplier in one of yalls videos sometime!!!
Guys there was eyes when you guys were doing the match thing I'm so sorry for point it out
Biggest scammers on YT, they tell audience that they are uncovering truth but when a small channel tells them about the truth of how they scam with technological tricks then they give them a copyright strike. Stop making a fool out of the people and come clean.
Hey guys is it possible for you to go to a neighbourhood that has an address called "657, Boulevard" and there is a mystery that has been unsolved for a very long time cause in that neighborhood a house is haunted by a stalker named "The Watcher" nobody knows its origin or even their real name but they just call it "The Watcher" this person is not a ghost nor a paranormal being but is a stalker and likes to haunt their victims for something unknown the house is also known to not be just a house but is a mentors house that drives people mad so is it possible for you guys to travel there although I don't really know where it its I only know about thrower kind of info but if you want the full story about it just search up "The Unsolved Mystery of The Watcher"
bring xplr to India guys!
This was amazing! You guys collected so much! I love how you’re polite to the spirits as well, treating them as the people they once were. ❤
I think you should do a video with Shane Dawson  Or Ethan nester
More of kallmekris and celinaspookyboo
I dont claim any negative energy from this video. You cant attach to anything. Dont follow me or harm me or my family. Goodbye.
1:03:31 BRO THESE GUYS ARE GETTING IN GHOST DRAMA LMAOO 😭😭
Bro sams got a sharper jaw line in the giggity guy from family guy 😭💗
My brother's name is William and he is really tall
Do u guys sell ur merch in New Zealand because I really wanna buy some but I live in New Zealand 🇳🇿
I'd much rather have this be my history class
More josh and seth pls
IMAGINE HOW FUNNY IT WOULD BE IF JSCHLATT DID A     INVESTIGATION WITH THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tom sandberg Ps det var da 😢🎉
y’all should do a video in san antonio tx! the history of paranormal there is so interesting and there’s a lot of different places y’all could explore
While watching these haunted series in the name of Jesus I pray no negative energy to be anywhere near me or my loved ones I pray for a hedge of protection and to keep me and my friends family and any other loved ones safe from their head to toes.
please do a collab with flamingo!! it would be so good
please don't start adding AI pics!!! not even because they're freaky because they suck!!!
I know Ranboo would love doing this. Rae~ get him and maybe even Sykunno kekekeke >;) <3
I love watching your guys videos in my free time It's so interesting watching you two explore haunted places. But my question is why not do the estes method in each haunted room or the most active rooms? I feel like doing that could give you guys the answers you're looking for. But it's understandable why you wouldn't. Also another question...would you ever bring one of your fans on an adventure with you two?
Y’all I’m a Christian I really care for both of you and Lord too Sam and Colby. The Lord says when people go to heaven they can’t come back to Earth it’s in bible. It’s just demons playing with y’all. Spiritual warfare is real trust me. I’m literally crying right now and I have cry in 9 years. I’m just worried Sam and Colby please think about this. Lord wants u come to him. Right now my holy spirit is giving me pain on my side right now. He telling me tell please don’t play with these demons yall. I’ll pray for y’all I’m just really worried for y’all that’s all.
Be careful the ritual works in real life when you watch it
Sam and Colby I’ve been a fan for 3 years now and I just discovered your Cerro Gordo video. Maybe you guys should go back for a visit
how the hell did i miss this??!
37:56 look into the doorway to the far right, two glowing eyes
I will never forget the first time you guys did the flashlight method! It blew my mind! My grandpa used those flashlights on the farm and I still do. I have never seen them turn on and off like that! I think you were with Celina in that video.
I do not allow spirits to come follow me or my love ones through or after watching this video. God protects me from all evil an through him i have no fear for you to instill me in but for the almighty one himself. I am thankful that I got to learn about parts of your story. May you rest in peace and my prayers go out to those who lost their lives in this hotel and all in the spirit world.
Aw man the hosting game. That took me back
The only thing that scared me the whole vid was the spider
The crash heard behind you was probably the spirit throwing rock at you. A. little before 9:33 in the video.
I have been watching y’all for a while now at fist I was sceptical about this gost stuff but y’all made me believe thank you for not only entertaining me but making me believe in my religion Evan more
yooooo no way!!!!! wish sykkuno was there lol
@Mr beast
I think it would be cool to see Nate, Amanda, Kris and Celina again maybe in one video if possible. Maybe you could bring in Eleanor Neale if you’re back in the London area. There’s a few really Spooky spots on Long Island, I think that’s the only State you really haven’t been. Much love from NY🤍
I want to go on a adventure 😢
Please go to the cecil hotel 😊
Can you go back to the crescent hotel again with kris and celina
You should bring David dobrick
i went to this same place in October! i FREAKED OUT when this first came out and i saw that they went to the same place as me!

I WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE IF YOU WENT WITH BENOFTHEWEEK TO A HAUNTED PLACE! I love what you guys do and I can always remember if I don’t want to go to bed, to watch this. Thank you guys for making us happy and scared 😅 but sometimes all you need is a little bit of your guys friendship.😊
been thinking about 45:08 and the name “Michael” and all i could think about the archangel michael .. and how he’s literally a protective angel
at 37:58 what is in that doorway on the right
HOLY SHIT I LIVE IN ILLINOIS
You should do a collab with Ryan and Shane from Watcher!
It would be really fun to see you guys go on an adventure with Laurenzside.
They should do Joe Bartolozi.
Can you guys collaborate with SSSniperWolf please
7 min for gods number
1:04:07 it honestly sounds like he 💀 pearl.
Dear Sam and Colby,  You probably won’t respond but I have tried talking to many medians yet they tell me the same thing every time. Yet I know there is something attached to me especially since I bring it everywhere I go. I don’t want to get ride of it because it hasn’t harmed me, but I want to find out who it is and why it’s following me.
OK so...u should collab with the sturniolo tripletsss If u agree with me 👇
YOU GUYS HAVE TO GO WITH SLIMECICLE
love u guys❤
bro how yall get universal, yall really out here swervin NORD VPN
Im saying this because I don't know if this is true:  Random people on YouTube are saying that you guys donb exist and that the people who see you guys have be sent to the nearest mental institution but I believe that you guys are real because you guys have 11 million subscribers like is the person who posted that trying to get everyone to be in a mental institution or what?
Sam and Colby helped me so much past these years and I don’t have stress anymore and struggle with school ❤Tysm
im 100% a spider killer lol sorry i hate spiders.
You should take Markiplier and Jacksepticeye 😂 That would be amazing
The sturniolo triplets need to collaborate with Sam and Colby so bad it would break the internet 😮😮😮😮

You should make a video with Kelsie Davies alot of people would watch that❤
Umm there’s a place I think you guys might like called bolsover castle . It’s built on a burial group and overlooks what was once the satanic capital in England . There’s been a lot of stuff going on including full apparitions and other hauntings
You should come to Byšta v Slovakia. To abandoned SPA.
Idk if it was the lighting but when Sam was grabbing the night vision camera i saw a blue like on the back of his neck
58:32 saying goodbye to all their new ghostie friends 'OK they said TOMB, time to go!' 😂lmao
when they couldnt spin their heads from 12-1 colby spun his head round i was like AHHHHHHHBCJWBFHEBKCBHEDWCJH WKGD
Honestly I think a Collab with Bailey Sarian would be so good
dear sam and colby hi my name is Bella and i just want to say thank you for you amazing videos  you guys have helped me so much with people bullying me and calling me fat and ugly.Thanks you so much for everything you guys do have a good day.
My ask you bro do you name kua red ghost hunter in the Philippines because do you no him because she say that thank for feed back god bless
Sam and colby why does the xplr club have to be so expensive like i really wanted it but i cant get it my mum said it too expensive i downloaded the app then went though so much to get the email bc its so complicated then after we finally got into it its too expensive please lower the prices or dont bc im apart of this cult but i dont have the sam and colby app sadly so sam and colby please just notice me i would love it you could just reply with an answer like it could be an emoji and i would die but ignore the fact i asked to change the prices im just being selfish that my mum cant afford 35 (we r in aus and she said that its 35)a month so please dont change it bc the world doent revolve around me
Shgsishidj
If i got thrown at by a ghost watch me pull out that holy water
You guys are great, and make seemingly authentic content. Way to go guys. But these two girls are way to loud and make some parts hard to watch. I bet they're super nice though.
Go there whit Amanda
WHY AM I WATCHING THIS AT 3AM?!?!
The  origin  video  Sam and  Colby did  the ritual  wrong  from 4 years ago  when  you  do a ritual  with three people  you have to all connect your  hands  all hands  together  to make  a full conectin  for the ritual  to be fully  functional  with  the power  of three  so the so the ritual  was incomplete
Please do a vid with shane and ryan 🥺
what the heck was that at the window 15:59
I don’t know if I’m dumb but is it just me or did I see something in the back around 40:01
https://youtu.be/XFkzRNyygfk?si=HLlvFYCoE65EKh21
https://youtu.be/XFkzRNyygfk?si=HLlvFYCoE65EKh21
Hey Sam and Colby I was just wondering if you guys already went to the amityville hunted house already but if you didn’t go I will probably recommend going but you’ll probably need more and impressive equipment 😅
I've got a spot in Sacramento. I'm down to be bait. The spirits want me anyways
they should get Mr. beast to do a investigation with them
Hey Sam and Colby I’m from Minnesota and I was thinking about it… I don’t think you guys have been to a haunted place in Minnesota, I think u should come visit and check out one of our very haunted places in Duluth, Minnesota right off the water of Lake Superior!
@NoahJ456
Im 10/10 believer
i claim no negative energy from this video
you should take BigPuffer, SilentDroid, Pezzy, and Grizzy they’re a gamer group and they’re the funniest mfs ever and it’d be so fun to see them try something of this caliber
to take shots with sam colby and spirits? that's bucket list material for sure
Five years ago today Sam and Colby got arrested
Hey “Sam and Coby” I need to tell u that I got an idea for u, what if u collab with Mr beast and his mates and it will be a very nice experience for both u guys and us thank u ❤
@Ph1lzA you should go ghost hunting with Sam and Colby!!!
hey I am looking for advice on what to do recently me and my family moved and it was fine at first but now im pretty sure its hunted because last night i was laying in my room with the lights on and  the door close then all the sudden it started to flicker and it went out and didnt turn back on so i fuigered that the bulb had just went out so i turned my tv on on it just staticed but i didnt think anything off it but like 20 min later my door it completly opened and i heard foot steps and then a breatheing and my tv went out (and wont turn back on) i think maybe this is an evil sprit but im not sure just freaking out if anyone has advice on what to do pls let me know
Jenna Ortega
I just  resized my brother's name is William and he is really tall😳
Markiplier
you should do more kris and celina
Can you guys do a video of calling scary numbers I would really appreciate it
you should do snake discovery
That movie was sooo bad 😭
Sam and Colby, i have a haunted place for you guys to investigate. Next to my apartment is a forest reserve called Fontenelle forest. It was originally used as a fur trade route. I get all sorts of paranormal things in my apartment because of the forest from ghosts of native Americans to elementals and everything in between. I live in Bellevue, Nebraska
I know I’m a kid and all but I want to be in your video I will go somewhere  alone or with somebody and do adventures I love ghost hunting but I live a long way than you guys I know it for a fact idk where y’all live but I know it’s not close to my spot
I claim no negative energy
i miss how much they used to post and do things i feel like now they arent as interested and genuine about it and just want to get content out like machines😔
Beyond proud of you boys and happy for you for your success keep it up dudes🥹🫶 y’all have come so so far
I’m curious what you guys would think of Jerome in Arizona. lots of interesting history there. my parents and I did a ghost tour there for my 18 birthday, and it was unusually active that night. the strangest thing that happened that night was when a spirit box that we were using started screaming and wouldn't stop, like, we left the area and it was still screaming, we turned it off, it was still screaming, it been over two years now and I still wonder if they ever got the spirit box to stop screaming.
Woooowwwww wish my fam would've known y'all were coming thru Illinois!!! We could've came and grabbed a selfie or somethin lol, Alton is about 40 mins from me!!! My daughter is sad to hear y'all were this close and she didn't get to meet you guys! Y'all are awesome and we LOVE watching your videos! Y'all should check out the Lemp Mansion in St.Louis, Missouri.  Keep the great content coming guys!
This DOSENT have to do with the video but Chef Lynja was amazing, fly high 🕊
And I think it should be Joey gersefa sorry if I spelt it wrong
Hii I am literally  like your biggest fan plz respond my name Aaliyah hope schake

Yall had an AMAZING 2023, Colby had beaten his cancer, earlier years Sam hurt his back! You’ve all accomplished so much
SAM AND COLBY HERES SOMEONE NEW THAT YOU SHOULD BRING ON THE CHANNEL.   THE HA SISTERS. (Evelyn, erica, and emily ha ❤)
I just watched the video where you learned your numbers and what they mean in numerology and Im a number 7 but i was also literally 1 number off if being a 33
You guys should have Melanie Martinez for your next video (Just a idea) :)
I’m so sad lol they was in my town and I didn’t even know 😭
I love how Colby said most of Pearl’s comments  And Rae saying most of George’s comments
Who else thinks colbys hot
You get D’adryian or corry
“hey what do you do for a living?” Sam and Colby - “oh I go ghost hunting because I have nothing better to do let’s record it and hopefully don’t get cursed for live”  SAM YOU LITERALLY HAD AN ATTACHMENT or still has & Colby might have one too tho but not sure WHY DO YOU DO THIS I KNOW IT’S INTERESTING BUT IF SMTH HAPPENSSS!!!
" What's up guys it's Sam and Colby" never gets boring
you guys should do one with the Ireland boys.
I LIVE IN ALTON ILLINOIS
You should bring D’aydrian Harding
When are you going to film again
You need to visit ashmore estates Charleston Illinois plzzzz!!!
yall think this is real? like really? is everyone here 12 and lack logical thinking?
id personally love to see albert/flamingo on this channel! id think seeing him on a paranormal investigation would be funny, but also interesting.
Okay, this was so fun to watch, but why is it creeping me out that I know someone names Cassie.
I loveee thisss
You should take some younger followers like in between 14-18 if they are interested in the spiritual world and see what will happen
41:45 Colby turns and looks behind him trying to connect to cassie. 1:04:25 Entity says that they came from behind. 1:04:34 While saying how they did their best not to look behind the entity says “I was there” when asked to confirm m the entity doubles down saying “better believe it” It sounds like one from the couple have been following them since the party, but constantly arrogant or annoyed with both investigators and their companion. Could be because they are so aggressive with each other and the energy they’re stuck in that makes other spirits avoid them. Could be why we didnt get much from cassie and the only time we get more is when they separate.
How old are y’all
PLEASE LET AMBER SCHOLL BE IN YOUR NEXT VIDEO PLEASE MY BDAY IS TOMAROWW
Just a little idea but yk how they said pearl and george are stuck in like a repeat what if the only way to get out was if they forgave eachother or was able to let go of the anger/sadness?
Colby looked behind him while trying to talk to cassie. 41:45
Pearls room the first time yall are there there is a shadown behind the plastic wrap against the window
Sam and Colby have you investigated the Cecil Hotel in LA?
You guys should go to Nopeming sanatorium in  Duluth MN

I've been told that I am a medium
The fact that a movie studio sponsored them….
in every video i always laugh when sam does the causal white girl thing from horror movies “hello?” it kills me every time idk why lol
Sam and Colby  I think you guys should collaborate with ENHYPEN
If you guys need to take a break go ahead you don't need to post every month❤
did anybody else see the two white eyes in the dark doorway at around 38 minutes?
About to tell CaseOh to hit yall up 😂

Please don’t use the ai art/images for the history segment. It looks so bad and obvious that it is distracting.  The uncanny and unrealistic images are also kinda disrespectful to the people.
A WHOLE COMPANY?!?!?!?!?! SLAUGHTER HOUSE GEOMETRY DASH EXTREME DEMON OMG OMG
Am I the only one who seen eyes when Colby turned to go to the pool
This is so cool, who else would love if Boze came to a place with them

What is that shadow at 16:00 going pass the window sort of thing
@TheBoys
OMG IVE BEEN THERE!!! I live like thirty minutes from Alton, it definitely lives up to its name!
Yay Sam and Colby sent us a video🎉
honestly i think it’d be really cool if you invited darla eliza, kris, and celina all in one video. the chaotic energy from those three would be impeccable 😮‍💨
#JHONWOLFE make him believe
When it said "Micheal" at 45:06 did anyone else think of the archangel Micheal? Maybe Micheal saved the guide from getting hurt by something inhuman.
I need you guys at me and my sisters friends house because there is a major ghost problem its really bad
@coldones need to go ghost/demon hunting same with @theboys
it was the limestone......
So I was watching your video and I was 16 minutes in and at 16:04 someone or thing ran out side of the window
This just isnt apart of this concept of the video but i relise by being apart of the cannel for a long time sam does not in this video but, he is always wearing Yellow when something super bad happens ! He wore Yellow when he got his attachment, when he got rid of the attchment!!!!! When @KallmeKris got scraches really bad in 2 videos and goat mans bridge and the club! And many more videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  @ 4:59
55:49 Leslie and Rea literally panicking thinking they're boutta die* Sam and Colby: Guys we just want to say from the bottom of our hearts, thank you so much for supporting the channel.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A VIDEO WITH TARAYUMMYYY

@teamsam1 @sam Malden
Hey are there any famous places to in Indiana?
All of my favorite ppls together!!! I so HAPPYYYYY!!!!🥹
This is really goo juice.
You need to come to Seguin, Texas. There's a place called the most haunted hotel in texas
I’ve investigated here just a little over a year ago and I have to say- it’s one of the scariest experiences of my life! I’ve encountered a lot of different things, but I’ve never felt energy like that until we did the investigative tour with Dave. I actually passed out cold in the slaughterhouse while we were doing the Estes method and using some different tools to communicate. I felt the heaviest energy overcome me and my vision blacked and I went down HARD 😳. I’ve never felt anything like that before in my life. I kept getting overwhelmed with rushes of energy throughout different parts of the building and we kept getting intelligent responses as a group. It was insane and definitely super haunted! But also one of the coolest experiences ever! The nearby town of Grafton is also incrediblyyy haunted (my father grew up there and witnessed so much tragedy and death) so that entire area is just teeming with energy!
I do not claim any negative energy.
8:04 *colby nods* lol
Michael is an archangel who fights evil entities, and the name came up around when they were talking about the guide's experience of being protected from the wall falling 🤔
I'm from St Louis and I've been to Alton Illinois a bunch of times another place that is supposed to be super haunted is lemp mansion in down town St Louis
The boys want to do a vid with you
i’m ngl i kinda wanna see markiplier go with them ghost hunting
37:50 look in the door beside the other one..commet if you see it.
Have you guys gone to the Carry House Hotel in California yet? It's in a small town called Placerville and it's an hold mining town
Bro Colby looked behind him when looking at the stairs  in the pool 👻
🥺 𝓶𝓮 𝓹𝓵𝓮𝓪𝓼𝓮  👉👈
Bring the boys on with you!!!
Do Eloise Asylum in Michigan! I went on a midnight tour oct of 2018 and felt absolutely everything! Still looking at the pictures almost seven years later!
Leslie and Rae are so funny! Leslie's personality is great😂❤
I think I would love to see more of kris and celina! Also Nate!!!!
Ok. Hear me out.   Collab idea: Sam and Colby with Smosh. I think it would be really fun to take Shayne, Ian and Anthony ghost hunting. I feel like they would bring some crazy fun, and I feel like everyone would vibe really well! I love both channels and you guys could appear on smosh as well. You guys are not only Paranormal investigators, but funny people in general. I think everyone would have a crazy fun time hanging out and it would produce some awesome content!  I love watching your ghost hunting videos so much! ❤❤
you need to film with celina and kris again plssssssssssss
❤❤❤
37:55 yall see the eyes??
why did you say five when there was only 4 of yall
Go to Dire Lane it’s a haunted Street location by Roseville California
Hey Sam and Colby, I know you guys probably won’t see this comment but I live in Illinois and there’s a few haunted places here with some cool legends. There’s a cemetery called Resurrection Cemetery with a ghost called resurrection Mary. There’s also a place called the Rialto Square Theatre. Ghost hunters investigated there. And also the Lincoln Park zoo had more than 35,000 bodies buried there, most of them have been moved but I guess there’s still more than 12,000 still buried there. Also the Manteno State mental hospital and the old Joliet prison. I love your videos and you guys so much it would be so cool if y’all would come to my home state!
I wish they pointed the stick figure thingy at the wood in the Celina video
Dude I had no idea about the limestone thing but that explains so much! Where I live there is so much limestone underneath us that it’s insane. I live by the river right now and it has a lot of limestone in it, and when I used to live with my grandparents I always had crazy paranormal stuff happening. And I thought that after I had left maybe it would stop and it didn’t. My grandparents had to replace a tower that was in there back yard, and they dug a whole that was about 15 feet deep and it was solid limestone. I mean 100% solid limestone. And because I now live by a river with a lot of limestone in it, the crazy stuff is still happening. It makes sense now!
you guys should go to skinwalker ranch it’s an actual place n it has paranormal activity
@KreekCraft @Flamingo
Why when they mention tall figure named William I automatically thought about Wilbur ? 😅
DOES ANYONE SEE THE EYES!!
You guys should visit the Mineral Wells Hill house in Texas it's haunted 👻
@samandcolby try to visit in the Philippines and try to investigate the Diplomat Hotel in Baguio, Philippines.
U
I have a suggestion for a place and a person the place is thomaston prison and also the person I should go with is Eddie vr just a suggestion🙂
Clix😊
They should take clix
I didn't know limestone plus water = more likely to have paranormal stuff pop up. The area I live near is incredibly old and it's all limestone buildings on the water.
hey sam and colby, my name is atlanta and i live in montana, and i think you guys should visit red lodge!  we have a couple of pretty haunted places that we think it would be cool if you wanted to check out! theres the pollard hotel that has been up since 1893, and got rebought and had added rooms and things in 1901-2. there is also the old beartooth billings hospital, which myself and a couple friends have had experiences there. I think you would really enjoy checking out the pollard hotel, ive screenshotted a couple of things that might be and sound interesting about the building to you. i think you would enjoy visiting a different part of montana. this town is also an old mining town, which we have the mining entrance not far up a trail. there have been a lot of accidents up at the mine and was deemed unsafe and got shut down. i think you would quite enjoy the different haunted locations just simply in one town. i hope you have a fantastic day and enjoy life! 😁
I feel like y’all should dr Mike and/or fgeetv
I just got your merch love it
the universal sponsorship is crazyyyy! congratulations, guys. bigger and better from here 🥂
They should visit XXXtentation grave to see if they could communicate with him

U should go to Madison dry goods in Madison North Carolina there is an unsolved murder of the whole family. Be the ones to unsolved it!!!!!!!
does anyone else think that when the person talking to Colby said "he stole it" it was pearl, and she probably meant that Goerge "stole" her wedding ring

I’m a big fan of y’all

Hi so me and my cousin saw a skinwalker I think but it was 6 feet tall and followed us! I am scared it was at night my car whet missing and then it just was terrifying
When they got the name "Michael" I immediately thought of the guide's story and assumption that it might be a guardian angel who pushed him -- Archangel Michael maybe?
Can I be in one of your videos? I’m trying to be a ghost hunter too.
I want to see you do it
I live just down the road from it
Come back to the goatmans bridge pls
Im i the only one don't think there taking it serious like before 😮

There’s a town in Texas called Mineral Wells and we have a hotel called The Baker Hotel. It’s crazy haunted and I’ve heard almost every story and had experiences arnd the building (they’re remodeling it currently so no one is allowed inside just yet)
For one of your next videos could you possibly investigate the Cecil hotel?
My loved ones and I claim no negative energies and no spirits from this video
30 minutes in sam colby says “its time to investigate our first haunted pool” but actually their first haunted pool is the pool from queen mary

#couple goals when pearl and George sit next to eachother
storytime: so basically I was lighting a candle while my grandma was telling me that this one house caught fire from a candle and right when she said that a box fell and i went over there and in my head i was like "is that how you died?" bc i thought her house was haunted or something idk? and then another box fell right after I thought that. Pretty sure her house is haunted
These dudes make crazy money from these videos

Not sure if you will be able to but go back to the Hellfire caves or one of the Irish Hellfire caves but go with Joseph Quinn (Eddie Munson) and the guys who was in Hellfire in stranger things. Would also love to see you do a video with @jacksepticeye and @Markiplier

You guys are brilliant. Godspeed.
Ik this might be a crazy but is their a way that u can prove that the devil/ satan is real this might be a dangerous thing to do but their is so many people that don't believe in the devil but they do fear the devil so if u can or u want to can u try to figure out a place to somewhat speak to satan.
I have an idea you guys should resurch about Ed gein also known as leather face 🧐please do this please please please and I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS #LoveSamAndColby😉
get beauty and fashion influencers! take Amber Scholl and Alisha Marie
I live in Illinois 🤯🤯🤯🤯
You guys should collaborate with Celina and Kris
REPENT to the Lord Jesus and you will be protected , says in the name of Jesus i rebuke any evil spirit in my body in the name of Jesus.
You guys should do a livestream
Is it just me but behind the girls at 22:15 I saw something run quickly behind them or is it just my imagination 😭
Yk Rae should've brought Sykkuno as well, just imagine him saying " Oh... " anytime something happens lmao
Hey Sam and Colby, can you guys collaborate with The Boys? I would like to see you guys collaborate
People how love Sam and Colby videos are going to like
Can yall visit abagil?
DID ANYONE ELSE SEE A FACE BEHIND THE TOUR GUIDE IN PEARLS ROOM??
bro nah my moms cousin died in alton illinois…..
You guys do such an amazing job!  This is definitely your calling. I watch so many paranormal channels and shows on streaming and you are my favorite. Not only are you both so cute and kind and funny, but you have a way of presenting just the right amount of history, comedy and intense investigation. I would like you to use the SLS more though. I love that thing and it provides indisputable proof in my opinion. Colby, I’m so happy you’re doing better and I just came across your music. You and your band are quite good. I was the lead singer of a rock band when I was younger. Most fun I ever had. I want to have the guts and bravery to face my fears with the paranormal. Your series on the conjuring house was beautiful!  It shined a more positive light which I’m sure the house and spirit much appreciated. Cody and Sotori were also amazing. I can’t get my daughter on board with them though. She thinks is BS but that’s ok. I believe it!!  Love you guys. Keep up the great work!  Btw, do you do your own editing or have editors?  Either way it’s very impressive!!❤❤❤
to think that one of my favorite youtubers weren’t even THAT far to where i used to live is crazy to me😭😭😭
Hi my name Is Emma and ever since I was little I loves ghosts and spooky stuff I would be delighted if I could possibly bc in one of your videos my age is 12 and I love ghosts so much thx pls respond
Not sure if you have tried this yet, but consider wiring some lavalier mics up by everyone's ears. Easy to do with a spot of tape or a plaster (band aid). If something whispers to someone, the mics should pick it up. If all this is genuine, that may be a way to document it. Rode mics are your friend in this scenario.
1:48 stop showing your wee wee
Does anyone know if they're posting a new video today?
@Jakewebber9  @ItsCoreyScherer the classic group would be so fun to see again!!!
hold didn't they get the word  "michael" when they where in the pool then just shrugged it off then go on to talk about some nonhuman spirit NAMED MICHAEL???!!! OR AM I DELUSIONAL????!!!!
I saw willam
37:58  there’s eyes in the door
have you gus ever played red door yellow door, if not you guys should play it somewhere haunted
I watch your videos every day and I love you guys!!!!!!
@maxandharvey
I just ate a cheese sandwich with mayonnaise. (I’m lactose intolerant)
You guys are so awesome. I think you guys should do a collaboration with Laurenzside

We want to see Sam & Colby x Summer and Jada x The Sturniolo Triplets
Ok but here me a out what if I’m a alternate universe it’s Colby and sam
You guys should go to the macdonald hotel in Edmonton  it's the most Haunted  hotel in Canada
Thank you Sam and Colby but I think as a local of Charleston sc you should come down here as it is known for having all sorts of ghost stories and legend say as my city used to put pirates bodies under buildings so when it flood they will be eaten alive or they used to put pirate’s bodies on sticks and then we had some important battles as the battle of fort Sullivan or the siege of Charleston and more so I think you should come to Charleston South Carolina
@ 41:51 did that count as turning around for Colby.   I could never do this I turn around because I constantly fell like I’m being watched
Sam and Colby, I love all of your videos.
You guys should do 28 days in a haunted location, per Ed and Lorraine Warrens 28-Day Cycle Theory!! Definitely would bring Amanda if you do it though. Netflix has a wonderful documentary on separate investigators trying to prove this theory.
TRY GETTING JOSH, SETH, CELINA AND KRIS ALL IM THE SAME VIDEO!!!! A GRAND SHOW THAT WOULD BE!!!!
Wild because about two blocks north is a mansion that was a tuberculosis hospital, and then a pyschward. Didnt believe in spirits until my brother moved there and I came to stay with him.
you should ask Mr beast the sigma male
41:53  colby turned around
YOU GUYS NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH AMBER SCHOLL
DO MORE WILL KRISS AND CELINAAAAA I LOVE UR GUY'S VIDS MORE THAN ANYTHING ❤❤❤
What if yall did a collab with pezzy and grizzy?

The Town Does not look scary qnd i didn't g3t really scared js a bit
When it said cupcakes it could have been the little girl who died at her birthday party at the pool because cupcakes are a party sort of thing and you said you guys had cupcakes it made it happy and cupcakes or cake makes all little spirits happy especially little girls
i recommend the castle Houska in czechia, that practically mean the 'Bun Castle', it's said that there's a portal, "gateway to hell", in the middle.   "Houska Castle, and most specifically the chapel, was constructed over a large hole in the ground that is a "gateway to Hell", which is allegedly so deep that no one could see the bottom of it. Animal-human hybrids were reported to have crawled out of it, and dark-winged, otherworldly creatures flew in its vicinity. Legend has it that when construction began in the castle, all of the prisoners that were sentenced to death were offered a pardon if they consented to be lowered by rope into the hole, and report back on what they saw. When the first person was lowered, he began screaming after a few seconds, and when pulled back to the surface, he looked as if he had aged 30 years. He had grown wrinkles and his hair had turned white." (from wikipedia)
Do you think you can visit the abandoned hospital named Glenn Dale hospital in Maryland?

Hey Sam and Colby I have messaged you on TikTok idk if you have seen them it is ok if you don’t what to respond 😊
If you ever do a big investigation, you should definitely fly out to Sweden, Borgvattnet. It is Swedens most haunted place. I’ve been there and have experienced things that shouldn’t be able to happen!   Amazing job with this video!

Please tell me you are doing protections for all of you before you do these rituals and games. Love your videos but as a practicing pagan/witch you two worry me.
No one gonna talk about how Colby turned around during the "party"
You should 100% do a collab with ranboo!!!!! They are a variety streamer who makes a lot of horror game content and they even made a horror series called generation loss that was filmed in an abandoned mall! (Also sunset and quqqie, they are all really close)
Samand colby are the goats 👇

37:58 so uh, hey sam and colby! what are, what are those eye looking things on the right?
Love your videos and been a longtime watcher. Have to say, the latest content has felt different and I find myself not watching the full videos. Missing the speculative and realistic nature your videos use to have. All love ❤
Hey Sam and Colby there is a really haunted building in Vancouver i don't know how haunted but its the old spaghetti Factory
YALL NEED TO FIND A PLACE IN WISCONSIN!!! I was born there and live there for about 12 years and I moved to Illinois almost 3 years ago so I wanna see if y’all could find something in Wisconsin even tho all everyone does there is drink beer, eat cheese and hunt
I live literally 40 something minutes from that town and to know that Sam and Colby were that close makes me wanna cry 😭😭
I claim no negative energy from this video
You should tag theboys which are Eddie, narrator, mully, juicy, and joshdub they have been wanting to go on a adventure
My brother is a killer (William Afton) And a fricking 7 foot tall man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I got scared at 22:11 , the car scared me😭😭
You should do a video with Laurenzside!
@LaurenZside, She would be perfect!!
Are you guys coming Australia still and if so where are yous goingg
Btw drinking while ghost haunting is dangerous it lowers your vibration you could easily get an attachment
They should totally get laurenzside to come with them, she matches their vibe and I think it'd be awesome
This might be late but you should do a vid with the sturniolo triplets
PLEASE GO SEE THE ANNABELLE DOLL!!
Me because my therian name is Charlie and one of my real nicknames is Lou-
Do a collab with big T/ BigTstreamingservice
You can tell these tour guides are serious when they have that 1 look in their face

@dashiexp @dashiegames
Vote for Mr. Beast to come
Have you guys seen Mindseed TV? They have some crazy poltergeist footage (if it's real).. would definitely love to see a reaction video from you guys.. or maybe you guys could visit one of their locations.   Thanks for 2023 and I look forward to 2024!
Sam and Colby i watching your video and i looked at the corner to the right and then eyes were watching you glowing eyes, check it out it's scary to see it!
Now here me out, just for fun. What if they couldn't go to the party. Was because they were all locked down there in the basement. Or something in the pool scared them.
around 10:30 into the video i heard clown music
GUYS I GOT MERCH
Im the next haunting video can you go to windsor castle because its said that Henry VII haunts that castle

Go on an adventure with Jack Osborne😊 you are my favorites.
The New York house when Colby filmed the house the person in the door can be the murderer from 2005 finding the guy to kill him
I have never ever connected with any youtuber or any public figure as much as i have with sam and colby....I love the content of many youtubers and am even influenced by them as a person but never ever has it been as strong as these two.... Not only is there content AMAZING, the kind of people that they are and how much effort that they put and how they strive to be better and grow moe and more.... I just love them and literally feel like they are family..... They are one of the few ones that keep it so real and just show who they are and i honestly relate to both of them in so so many ways..... Like seriously if we did a test i would be 50% sam and 50% colby...... Keep being who you are.......lots of love and protection
This was so fun! I could watch 10 hours of it
I wouldn’t exactly call Megan a great movie. It wasn’t bad,but it sure wasn’t great.
XPLR X Universal Pictures
41:47 didnt colby turn his back/head??? Or??
Next is the hinsdale house
Please I beg you we need Sam colby and @daz games to go on a ghost hunt together 😢 (like my comment if you agree)
Lmfao. I went there once. Alton is my hometown. The guide asked if we heard footsteps one floor above us, and I literally said it’s probably the second group that we know is already up there. They said I’m not allowed back.
👍
I want to see Pokimane and Kyedae
@jacksepticeye @markiplier this would be so funny if you could get these guys
leslie cant be quiet the whole time
Santea, gerohan, Kevin, Jose, Rey, Valeria, jayco, Val
43:45
I’ve watched this video like 20 times and I just watched a Youtube short about how there looks like glowing eyes on the right at about 37:53 like a few seconds later. Literally found it at 1:30am 😭
I think you guys collating with Loey Lane would be awesome
Re-watch the last method part and see it as Colby-> Wife, Rae-> husband.
Can find out about the Siberian dancing lady plzzzzzzz❤
I kept forgetting this was their first ghost hunt. I was starting to get annoyed, but id get friendly reminders. Honestly they did really well and i hope they continue on their own! ❤
Crotch transition
You guys should get a rapper to go ghost hunting which you
Have you been to the island of dolls in Mexico? Or ghost hunt in Hawaii--the whole island (Oahu in my experience) is full of spirits
SAM AND LESLIE AT THE PART WHERE THEY USE THE ESTES METHOD WERE SO FUNNY. LIKE everytime george or Pearl answers thry were just freaking out😂😂
When watching this I think I saw a ghost looking at me or something
damn universal!!! you guys have grown so much!!
Hi Colby and Sam my name is Victoria and I watch all your videos with my brother! I just wanted to say I love your videos and I think you guys are for real awesome :) i would love to meet you guys I believe in paranormal activity and ghosts and I love the effort and commitment you guys make to be able to speak with others. ❤️
Don’t quit ALL THE YOUTUBERS are quitting out of nowhere    MATPAT MAN….😢😢😖😔😔😔
I torture myself by watching these videos in the dark alone at night
16:00  there's a shadow that moves across the window cover. I'm not seeing a light source that could've caused the way it moves
When I was younger I had an experience of this old man I would talk to at night but no one could see him at night I also saw people laying above me while I was asleep it was a ghost not the other thing
@mrbeast come on do it
Awesome scripting 😎
Did you know that in Australia most of the hotels will skip the number 13 because of superstition is this just Australia or is there any countries that do this as-well??
My adhd self would sit there hearing splashing and seeing wet footprints like 🤷🏻‍♀️ makes total sense it’s a pool and then think about it like a year later and be like 😱 hold on a second, the pool was Empty!! 😅
VALKYRAE
Sam and Colby should try the Silverland Inn & Suites in Nevada it seems really cool to ghost hunt in! Plus it’s in a ghost town like this one!
holy crap 11:50 scared the shit outta me LOL I THOUGHT there was a face in the top center of the screen 😭 😭  😭

PLEASE BRING RAE AND LESLIE BACK AGAINEE!!!
Yall should collab with @kimmytan n get stoned n investigate
The random ass guests are always so dramatic 💀😭
Sam and Colby can we plsssss!! Have a update on the abandon videos!!! <3
Hi Sam and Colby!! I love watching ur vids and this is day 2 of a request. I don’t know how haunted it is but I go to a campground multiple times a year called Potato Creek in Indiana. It is the most haunted campground I’ve been to and I go to over 50 campgrounds a year around my area. It has cabins where shadow figures are seen, orbs, and lights flicker. And back then kids died in the lake from drowning so people hear them screaming at night. And it also has a cemetery with a trail next to it. I hear many stories about people being touched, seeing orbs, and seeing shadows peek behind trees on the trails. Can you guys visit there soon?
Ayeee nice to see you guys again
Everytime i see one of these videos I start thinking about the house in my neighborhood that multi people have died in 😭
If you look really close when they were talking about the portels and about Charlie and Lou behind the girls the was like a black thing really fast behind it went back and forth but you have to be looking behind the girls
MY DREAM IS TO MEET SAM&COLBY THEY ARE MY LIFE love u guys so much!!!!!! remember that
Do you want to be are game on roblox sam and colby
Sam and Colby can you play RED Door  Yellow door
So funny
My son Toivo (Uniquely Undeniable on YouTube) loves you guys and I enjoy spending time with him watching your stuff. We are both into ghosts and haunted places. I have even been trying to get him equipment for ghost hunting. I am hoping to surprise him with a trip to Shakers Cigar Bar in Milwaukee, WI. this summer and it would be amazing if you guys could join us.
I really wanna see yall do an investigation with zane & heath !
Something was plugged in behind the flashlight when they were talking to Lou maybe a remote receiver?
Uhhh i have somthing to say….  Cole-be-mine❤❤❤
Sam and Colby in my city I have some haunted places that you could investigate if you do that I would be So happy and it would make my day Also this was a awesome video
I love these A.I Generated images around the video
37:55 tell me I’m not the only one who seen the eyes in the right corner… 🥲🔫
Guys j saw a black shadow behind the girls
hi (i liked my own comment btw)
I absolutely love Sam and Colby you’re one of my favorite YouTubers in the world and I’ve been watching you for the past two month
Was it just me or did yall see that shadow behind fuslie at 16 mins or was that a shadow from the cam light but no one was moving or was there still people(guests,workers) around idk 😅
Cobb Estate misses y'all.
Still waiting on that apology video.
13:55 13:59 14:00 14:01 14:02

Sam and Colby, lately I have been feeling annoyed at school and friends so I started watching your videos and they have helped me a lot! Thank you  <3
May I be in a video?
imagine bringing coryxkenshin to one these, it'd be a dream come true  😭
I remember when Sam had to walk around the haunted prison in the dark alone 🤦🏾
I really want to see them collab with markipler. he’s one of my favorite creators.
i do not claim any negative energy from this vidoe
leslie is so gorgeous
during the part they were in the roomm with the blindfolds, itd be better if they stopped getting so "oh my god, theyre doing exaclty what we want them to be doing and I don like it" because that ruins the conversation
I loved you guys channel so much I grabbed my friend so we could try do some stuff like this! I think what you guys should do for your next adventure is go to the Shepton Mallet prison in the uk. I’m going there soon with my best friend to talk to ghosts with our ghost supplies! Id love to see my favourite YouTubers to go somewhere I am going to soon x
You guys should collab with Brandon Farris and camreon domansky❤❤❤
They got a sponsor from UNIVERSAL!?!???!??!??!?!!
guess who's on heroin?
Sam and colby can you go to the hell house  with with Seth and Amanda please and thank you
Big fan Sam and colby
Did anyone not see the glowing eyes in the bottom right at 37:58 😮
I love you Sam and Colby I’ve watched all ur videos there creepy but there’s this haunted place in my town it’s a elementary school used to be elementary to high school and there was a fire n some kids died in the fire there is blood on the door it’s haunted it’s scared me when I went there
37:56 Eyes could be seen but might be light you guys see.

https://youtu.be/LLdyNxtWv-A?si=vmP7qJKXwQgz9Cth
This is a good video!! I'm waiting for the Sturniolo triplets to be on this channel, with the two of you guys.
7:54 Colby is so sweet asking if she wants to take a break. speaks volume
you miss up the ritual and then a name was said in the device! You guys have to be more careful and not invite other entities or even make the place worse
Ayeeee yall was in my town!!! My friends met yall! I wish I was there😢😢😢😢
More Kris, Celina, Amanda, and Mackie for 2024! Letsss gooooo!
take jynxzi on one
In the section that they couldn't turn around, what Colby did in the 41st minute and 54 secondso so isn't considered turning around?
The phasmophobia comment at the beginning 😂
I am not claiming any negative energy from this video and i do not want this spreading to me or my loved ones throughout watching this series. Thank you so much for listening to our side of the story❤ also i am sorry if i had made any  glances i shouldn't  have i am  sincerely sorry!
I would LOVE to se @SSundee do an investigation with you
uu guys should try the cecil hotel
You guys should go to The Yesteryear Village. It's located in West Palm Beach Florida. It seems like a Nuclear test village from the 1950's. It has been used as a dorm for a near by college as well as other things like the home of a woodland cemetery gate keeper. There have been reports of people seeing things walking by windows, being pushed, spoken(whispered) to, and witnessing lights go on and off when they were the only ones there. It is rumored to have angry spirits. Joseph, the said to be house owner at the time, was facing many struggles financially and decided to hang himself in the attic. After his suicide a diary he wrote on strange things he witnessed in the house was reported. After this many more strange occurrences happened. Barry Cochrane (ghost hunter) has also gone through this house, honestly I do not totally believe it is true coming from him. It is said that there is an even bigger underlying secret in this house. Just an idea for a future video! more information can be found online or more scary places in Florida that I think you should visit at this link: https://www.inflorida.com/news/south-floridas-most-haunted-places/795  (Colony Hotel & Cabana Club  and Jonathan Dickinson State Park)
Yous should go too Inunaki tunnel
I've heard @Grian, @ImpulseSV,  and @skizzleman mention wanting to do legit ghost hunting before!   I love y'all's videos and look forward to the next new adventure! Keep up the awesome work, guys!
Collab with twin paranormal they are crazy hungry for gohst hunting
You really need to have the MetaPsykicks on to help you investigate! They will change the way you see the paranormal!
Ogs, where you at?
Hey Sam and Colby I found a haunted house called the Boyd house I saw a video on it and it's creepy there are tons of dolls
Please get @Caspersight on your next video
The next guests on an adventure with you guys  should be @jasko and Ben, that be crazy awesome!! 🖤
1:01:19 look at the diffrence in Rae sitting and colby sitting the confidence for colby and the scared in Rae is a full disclosure of who the pro is
Can we all do some mass unfollowing to get them to start posting more often , so many subs and not enough uploads
You guys should definitely visit vienna in 2024!!! There are many haunted locations and even one of the most haubted ones in europe!!!!😄❤️
pls film with kris and celina not these pickmes
At this point when they are doing the Estes method and she said stolen remember that the husband stole the ring after she died
Why not more cameras installed so audiences can see, hear in the same time?
Hi I'm a big fan my name is Braidan and I've been to a lot of haunted places before
I love horror films, I watched night swim and it was good but I didn’t feel the scare factor for it but it was still an amazing film, I love the videos lately I love that they have started to bring more different people. Love you guys :))
I need Rae to explain 26:29 your what is off?

I live in Illinois and nownim sad i didn't get to meet you even though I live close to Alton
Did anyone else see a shadow in the back at 16:00 😭😭
I do not allow the negative energy to follow me and my family.amen
this is the first time i've watched a video with headphones.. well i zoned out looking at something else and i heard "i have demons attached to me in every hole" .. EXCUSE ME
Can you please go to Clinton road.   Please please do Research before you go please and thank you 🙏
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones or friends throughout watching this. Thank you for listening to our side and open minds. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glance’s or out reach I shouldn’t have done and may everyone give upmost respect.
You guys should go to the Eloise house, there’s mass graves there with over 7,100 bodies, the history is really sad and horrific too but I recommend going, it would be a an awesome video 😎
in the video at 22:12 something ran in the back behind what looks like a counter
My sister and i were in my room, my sister  was sitting on the floor between the mirror and my bed as I was sitting on my bed facing the tv. While watching t.v., I noticed my sister looking back and forth from head bored to the mirror.   That's when she looked at me and said something black was standing by the head bored above Me, the minute I looked to where she pointed too, right behind the cross above my bed was a sound of fingers tapping on the wall.  That's one of the many times my sister has seen,senced or heard voices. I think it's really cool she can sense that stuff.
The one in the lobby is Lucy
'Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.   (Psalm 73:24-25) 'It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.   (Psalm 118:8-9) 'Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.   (Psalm 119:9) '(O give thanks unto the LORD who) hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.   (Psalm 136:24)
The Sturniolo Triplets
@dazgames @markiplier @DanTDM @ryan @JoeBartolozzi @Danny-Gonzalez @benoftheweek pls reach out and collab with these guys it will be quality content ‼️‼️‼️
There was something in the back at 22:00min
37:58 SCARES ME SM
ik he probably wouldnt but coryxkenshin would be a cool guest on one of these vids
You may go into hounded and buildings but none of youse cant deal with teeny tiny spiders
Thank you so much Sam and Colby! Your content has helped me through so many struggles in life! Keep doing what you do best!!!
PLEASE I NEED YOU TO BRING JEROMEASF/JEROMEACE
you should get alex warren and kouvr !!!
they were in Illinois.. and didnt tell me?...
Did anyone else see Colby turn and look to the stairs when explaining the marbles😂
Sam and cobly may you go back and please do the estes method
It so cool how thay did not die yet
Hold on…. There are just ppl casually living in that place?!🥹
you should do a double Estes but one only says male voices but the other says female ones
Did anyone else notice the face that was behind Colby in the photo of them at the end of the video? It's cool and kind of creepy at the same time. Also I love your videos, I've watched every single one. I love ghost hunting. I really hope that I will get the chance to be in one of your videos someday in the future!
Listen carefully at 55:41.  Rae is saying "Dude I have chills" and as she does you can hear what sounds like a long, deep exhale.  Both Rae and Leslie are talking, and this breath happens at the same time and sounds more manly than either of them.  What's worse is it sounds really close to the camera's mic - I've listened to it on my laptop, on my TV and with my headphones and it definitely sounds close.
The story about the woman in black that appears before accidents happen, reminds me of the film the woman in black 😳 I would so love to tag along in one of these videos! I'm so interested in the paranormal and quite intune with it 👻
You should collab with Mikie from Glam&Gore!
1:02:28
Y’all are amazing I finally started my yt vids showing my face bc y’all made me less scared and made me realize I could be myself and don’t have to change for someone
The collab I want to see is the sturniolos and Parker and chester(life of luxury)
ik rae said she’d never do it again but this was such a good episode I hope they come back 😭😭
The fact that everytime Sam and colby get scared they literally start saying, "go buy the merch guys!"
O(k k k
If something was sitting in the chairs, they were tied up! It totally isn't just those cameras working on shapes (e.g. the legs of the chairs) and being not magical. xD
rae and leslie were so fun to have on omg😭😭
You I. Live by Alton and am a huge fan and would be a dream if you come and see us
This might be the funnest horror video I saw from y’all IT MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

34:18 the blue door started closing???
Hi Sam and Colby, I really love all of your videos and I would really love it if you could invite the Ha sisters to go experience this too. They are Evelyn, Erica and Emily. They are a YouTuber.
Worst episode you've made,  cringe worthy even , you spent most of the time flirting with the lovley girl with long dark hair .. who clearly didn't give a shite about the episode. Don't know what's going on with you 2 but something feels very off .

I do NOT allow any negative energy, entities, spirits, or anything else to come around me or the ones I love while watching this series. Thank you for letting us hear your story.
NEW FAN!!!
Alton as in goatmans bridge  ?....
41:52 does that turn disqualify Colby? Lol cause his head is kinda turned over his shoulder?🤔🤷🏼‍♀️
"A seven-foot tall man named WILLIAM" Me: William Afton?
So y’all were caught on a live-streaming camera being disrespectful and straight up disgusting and can’t put out any kind of apology for it this is the world we live in very classy
Bring InternetCity Aaron and Mikey to one of these! 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
At 37:57 look at the bottom/middle right you can see something that looks like eyes but it can just be knobs reflecting
Am I the only one that noticed 2 glowing eyes at 37:58 , scary 😭😭😭
YOU GAINED ONE MILL. SICE OCTOBER
I definitely feel like Toast and Michael would be perfect for this
playing shots with ghost is just wild😭😭😭
Hii sam and colby can you guys plz come to kempton hospital in south africa it is one of the most haunted hospitals
"YouTube channels is named after yourselves.."  Cringe.
"wild dogs" lies
Cringe
Lies
Cringe
Ugghhhhh.... Lies
Go back to witches forest?!!????
This is an idea, but why don’t y’all do the ouji board while doing the Estes method on your next video?
11:32 you are scarring me 3 days ago I heard footsteps in heavy snow outside the kitchen window and my brother had gone to school my mom whas asleep and my step dad whas at work there whas no snow outside
what's the requirements to come spooky hunting with y'all? lol
You guys should come investigate Old Town Spring! There's a haunted restaurant Wunsche Bros. There's also a Doll Hospital. The most interesting thing to me though is hearing about Judge Doering's home and the tree he's a creepy dude. @samandcolby
YO! 51:19 listen VERY closely. Right before (during the night vision) Colby sees the mouse running pass you can hear a distorted voice it sounds like someone saying “Help!”
Like if you're here because you see Leslie and Rae face
so scary man i was trying not to look behind me too hahah 😂
I do NOT allow any negative energy, entities, spirits, or anything else to come around me or the ones I love while watching this series. Thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you for everything you guys do. I’m sorry for any glances I made that I shouldn’t have.
Mykie from Glam & Gore and her boyfriend Anthony Padilla

Sam and Colby X The Boys
I think a collab with  Urbex Hill would be phenomenal! Shiey is also an interesting urban explorer and adventurer who would bee a great collab
You guys should go to Rockford Illinois a lot of haunting there
YOU GUYS WERE IN ILLINOIS??
21:39 AI generated image. Lol

Really love every vid. Just dnt like the ones with amanda.and im not trying to be mean .but yall was making me a believer until she showed up .its obvious shes lieing.
I love how Colby was like this is not paranormal but I just saw a mouse go wee that had me dying of laughter  🤣
My brother had his b-day on jan 5th he turned 15 he loves ur vids.....NOT AS MUCH AS ME THOUGH AGGHEHEGEGGGA👹
hey! samand Colby, have you ever thought about using a crucifix in a paranormal investigation before? cause i heard that demons and dark spirits hate crucifixes!
My daughter and I love these videos! ❤
Anyone notice the eyes at 37:53 when they go into the pool room it might just be the light but I got jump scared 😭
Like if you want Sam and Colby to play Phasmophobia  👇

Can you take JMANCURLY on one of these adventures please
I just wanted to say that yesterday I my cousin and I were having a sleepover then we heard some knocking and like the sound of the front doors opening then banging I don't really know but my sister heard it with me after we slept I had a dream about an accident after me and my sister woke up my sister told me she had a dream that a shadow figure was staring right at her and something or someone asked her to kill her self I don't know what that was and if it is something that should be taken care of it kind of sounds unreal but I swear it was not any imagination...
37.59
2 things, why when they were talking about the new movie right before they win to the pool, why did Colby just stare into the depth of my soul and just walk backwards like that one monster from Moana did .  And the Sam and Colby bots on character ai are wild. They have no chill..I got trauma from those bots, not literally but metaphorically. Anyway great video! I remeber watching you guys when I was younger when you would go explore abandoned amusement parks and what not. I would stay up all night watching your videos . Now that I have gotten a laptop for Christmas I’m gonna be way watching you guys during school. When I finish my work. You guys are amazing!
Y’all should do a Collab with the boys
8:33 "and a giant like 7 foot figure" "named william" i can think of a very tall figure named william 👀
Was I the only one who got had a headache when they put on sound on in the pool?
Who remembers #solby?
Yo is no one going to talk about the shadow outside the window at 16 minutes
when the guide spoke of the blue light that pushed him before the wall collapsing that would have been 1 of the 7 archangels .. blue is archangel michael...❤️
Happy new years
You came to Illinois and didn't tell me? :_\
37:52 when yall are about to turn they are 2 sets of glowing eyes in the large door way
at the time of the video play it to 22:12 you can see a shadow run behind the two girls 😮 I jumped when I saw it
honestly people sayin a collab i lowkey wanna see them collab with  so of the krew members i know it's not reasonable but i'd like to see it someday😄
post pls
Did anyone notice the eyes at exactly at 37:57 min in or is it just me
@samandcolby you should do a lot more haunted videos with (Haunted Nights) I have saved most of those videos to a playlist to watch
the estes method is my favorite by far ❤
37:57 see the eyes in the other room?
Da mouse 😂

I need help my house is haunted and I was wondering if you could in vestagate
Sam and Colby,   My son and I would love to see Mr. Beast to host with you on a haunted adventure. Do you think that could happen?   Jen and Zealand
I've been to the store in Alton Illinois yes it is also a store and it is very creepy and they have many demonic dolls on the walls inside along with Ouija boards and some satanic dolls and a couple artifacts used in real life including an asylum operating table
I never new someone could ever get sponsored by Universal Studios 😮
when sam walked threw the door 57:36 it scared me and i spilt tea on my bed
Question? Do the guest not watch sam and Colby?🤷🏻‍♀️
Did Colby break the game rules
You guys should do an investigation on the San Haven Sanatorium right outside of Dunseith, North Dakota. I hear it is the most haunted place in our state. I guess it turned into an Asylum in the 60s and lots of people died there. Then in 2001 a 17 year old boy mysteriously died in the building while investigating for spirits.
Come on, guys make more videos. It's been 10 days since you've done your last video. What is this one? Come on, guys, hurry up everyone's waiting pretty much.😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Hiii I luv your vids been watching for almost a year now luv your videos so so much it’s my birthday tomorrow and if u see this can u like my comment Bec it would mean the world to know you saw my comment so ye also happy birthday Colby for a few days ago 🫶🏼🖤🤍👻
You should do one with unspeakable and PrestonPlayz
Your videos are the best. I want to be in your videos. -killian
You should go to the old Adelaide Gaol in South Australia it opened in 1841 and closed in 1988 it had over 300,000 inmates in the years it was open consisting of men women and children it’s one of Australia’s most haunted places
random theroy, what if when they drank the water and died nearby their soul was attached to the town?
I relate with valkyrae😭
YALL SHOULD TAKE BAYLEN LEVINE AND HIS FRIENDSSSSSS
SAM AND COLBY WHY DIDNT YOU TELL US CELENA WAS IN THE NEW MOVIE
Sam: “7 foot tall man named William. .”  My mind:It’s not William Afton. .It’s not William Afton. .It’s not William Afton. . Or is it😨 Sam:There was also a little girl named Cassie who drowned-“ My mind again: NOW CASSIE😨 Edit: Sam:”Can you give us a name?” Spirit:”Michael” My mind💀:FATHER. .ITS ME MICHAEL. . Sam:”Why are you here?” “Michael”:”Decompose.”  My mind:💀
PARIS!! Sam 😌 time to face ur fear

Hey Colby if you see this your in my dreams
Yall should contact jay3 or dangmattsmith
What a great video to end 2023!!! ❤❤ Hope that 2024 will be as good as 2023. I am hoping you guys investigate the Cecil hotel and the Ringling House.
Sam:Deff not like 5 ppl in there Sam:or a seven foot tall man Colby:nAMeD wiLlIAm
i wanna see you guys collab with Coryxkenshin
More murder mystery
sam the thing is still following u
Hi I was whaching one of colbys videos where he read fan paranormal gost story's and I would love to share mine with u
I think you should do a video with Bella and Larray
Hi Sam and Colby! I dont know if you will ever read this but You should both revisit Waverly Hills! I was there for my 18th birthday and it was my first big ghost experience aside from small instances in my house(Slamming doors, toys on without battery's, etc) I hung out with this 19 year old girl and her mom. The 19 year old was a bit of a medium and they had an emergency so we start exploring and the places we got full on conversation was the room of the women who loved Elvis Presley, The OR, Recovery, and the children's ward. The or was most active and at one point it made the 19 year old physically sick and it touched her mom's leg. The vibe it the room before it got like that was ok but then it suddenly changed like my anxiety random went up and the Emf was staying at yellow or above for answers. Maybe with a spirit box you can both find out more!
You guys should collaborate with Brandon rogers
Please make a video with Theboys, it would be amaising
You guys don’t think the reason why y’all felt heavy in the pool, was because of the drownings?
48:50 "we'll come back for you" that would scare me so much 😭
these two is so annoying ....are they really hunting ghst or had come for foursome.
you guys got to meet them @yeptheboys
Ok hear me out DO A COLLAB WITH THE BOYS 😫😫😫😫
You guys should do a Collab  with the boys.
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones through watching this. Thank you for letting us listening to your side of the stories. I'm sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn't have and I give my utmost respect, may you rest in peace.

you need to make another samantha and coleen video
guys go to 37:55 in the video and look at the door.. there is something watching while they worry about the matches..
34:56 - not the: “sh—.” And everybody is also like: oh shi-  36:55 - 41:53 … Does that count as a turn around?  51:16 “He throws rocks- what a di—.
Go to the “6 Mile Wayfarer Hotel” in Charleston
37:58 you can see two yellow lights at the door … they look like eyes-
Research “Bloody Point” Daufuskie, SC y’all have to come down and investigate, also some abandoned buildings and homes from the economic crash of 2008 left behind.
You guys need to come to South Carolina and investigate Charleston. But one place in particular you need to investigate is a place on a secluded island called “Daufuskie” near Savannah GA and Hilton Head Island SC. Massive colonial battle between natives and settlers, the battle field is known as “Bloody Point” you guys would love it, it’s on the beach!
Bro sam and  Ray look like they can be a good cuople
I imagine Lou being a wasted spirit having a hard time walking to the flashlight and therefore he is a Lil delayed 😂
Sam and Colby I search another islan the name of this island is Mackinac island I hope you see this thank you I have been a fan for years we love you❤❤❤
Sam and colby teachme more about  history than school does 💀
I hope you guys have tips for me bc there Lives 1 or more ghosts in my house and I want to talk whit them but idk how. 1 ik you it is and his name is Rudolph and he died bc a white car drove him over. we live in a school and he was learning in that school and he is supper active. Once my brother was walking to the gym and he hear his name 2 times in his ear. It freakt him out. There is an other one that was the principal en he wants us gone……
I claim no negative energy from watching this video
In my opinion my favourite horror movies are nightmare on elm street Friday the 13th and Childs play and scream and the 2018 Halloween 😊
The hosting game what a throwback 32:36
@TheBoys

Super impressed of your merchandise being picked up and distributed at Zumiez. Wow! That’s a big step. Congratulations!
That Estes session though!!!!😊
What is up with the "i do not claim" whatever comments, did Sam and Colby's comment section just become full of bots or do people think the Youtube comment section is some sort of church?
just mentioned you guys on crayators stream and he said he is a firm non-believer and he might be interested
These videos hit hard when you're sick

Hey Sam and Colby AMAZING video can’t wait for what new adventures you take me on in the new year and I think it’d be super cool if the YouTuber Kelsi Davies could be in one of your videos she’s a psychic, I follow her as well and I just think this would be the best collab for the new year.
I live in lLLinoise
i guess sam's 3am challenges from 2019 actually made it into a sam and colby video. only four years later (now five, jeez).
Sam and Colby needs to explore Epsteins Island
That's so awesome you guys! Congrats for getting into Zumiez! I was just thinking about ordering a shirt, I'll go check out their stock 💙 thank you for all your hard work over the years, you guys are the best!

I feel so sad for Pearl I actually started crying during the estes method
SAM AND COBLY!!! i love seeing rae and lesie do this, next, u sould try to get vanossgaming because the "dude, i'm not scared" on his channel is still fresh
You should try doing a video with @kelseiidaviess
Sam and Colby there was a very recent video of The boys,Mully, Narrator, Eddie and the rest of the boys who were terrified of the haunted place they were at i believe it would be good to make sure they feel better about the terrifying experience they have had and to help them believe in the paranormal.
Oh helll nahh
i do not allow spirits to come follow me or my love ones. I am thankful that i got to learn about your story and I‘m sincerely sorry if i made any glances i shouldn’t have done and may have everyone gibe you the upmost respect. May you rest in peace.

Valkyrae want me fr😭😭🗣️🗣️🗣️
You guys should work with “ The Boys “!
“If you want to see your favorite creator on here” y’all are my favorite creators. 😘😊
im so proud of them they have grown so much in the past few years its insane keep up the good work guys
Can you visit the whispers estate in Mitchell Indiana
Great video! Absolutely love the new merch but it's sold out. Hope it gets restocked soon. Keep up the great work guys!❤😊
I really want to see @dantdm in one of these videos😭
Howdy 🤠
Im so sorry, but with the estes method in pearls room, Rae didnt get NEARLY as much words coming through as she would have if Leslie wasnt holding onto her whilst freaking out and moving around. nothing against Leslie, like bless her heart shes a sweetheart, but think back to the Stanley when the boys did the interview with the creator of the estes method, one of the biggest points was trying to get the person into a meditative state, Rae wouldn't have been able to do that the same way Colby did because Leslie was grabbing her and holding onto her and moving around so much :/
avenge the spider
16:00 u can see a shadow figure go pass in that window so Sam and Colby can see
I used to live in Alton Illinois
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!! YOU HAVE BROUGHT LIGHT INTK MY LIFE FOR YEARS AND I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO DO SO FOREVER ❤❤❤
Did u guys see the shadow run
SAM AND COLBY SKIP TO 15:50 AND UP, ON THE VIDEO AND LOOK AT THE WINDOW BETWEEN THE GIRLS, THERES A SHADOW THAT MOVES QUICKLY LMK IF U SEE It
The friend had me dead the whole time🤣🤣😭
Anybody else see the window at 16:00
@killsmartyr @badbishlily
It's how for the "party" no one came but 3 or 4 people talked with Rae and Leslie in the basement 😂😭
After I watched this I stared summoning sprits in my room 😭
My college campus is actually on top of limestone and has 3 man made ponds I work in the library and I can’t tell u how many things I’ve experienced I live in a dorm there too by myself it’s so scary dude 😭
Y’all remember when they gave out their phone number I prank called them saying it was Donald trump😂😂😂😂😂😂

That means my aunt lives by this
NO ONES TALKING ABOUT HOW THE ALICE BOX SAID MICHAEL AND HOW THEY SAID THE NEGATIVE SPIRITS NAME MIGHT ALSO BE MICHAEL AHAHAHAHAHAHA
Love your vids❤❤
Never really believed in ghosts until I moved into my current house. I was sleeping in my chair in the living room, by the window. I was looking out the window, and out of nowhere I watched the curtains close on their own. My brother says he can see a man standing in the corner of his room at night, and we have found many oujia boards in a little room in our basement. Honestly, I really want to move out.   Edit: yall out here really don't need to inform the comments that you don't accept and negative energy. As long as you know in your head that you can't be hurt by the energies, you will be fine.
Will we see a vid with a Sturniolo triplets
I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone but every time I watch a Sam and Colby video I get this tightness on my back that kind of feels like there’s a hand pressing on it or like I’m wearing a backpack. It even feels like this when I’m leaning against pillows. But it only happens when I watch videos like this.  Also I’m not sure how I feel about kind of having the same name as that little girl that died in the pool
do an overnight challenge with mrbeast, that would be a BANGER videos
Have you two ever heard of Willard library. It may not be the most haunted but still it’s haunted by a lady name “the Grey lady” and she will most likely be downstairs in the kids room. There is another woman who would be in the library doing all sort of stuff and she died a few years ago, my great grandmother knew her too
I like your videos and keep up the good content
Bring faze rug back
omg i forgot to tell colby happy bday😭 happy late bday colby love youu!
you guys need to invite the sturniolo triplets! you guys look like you will get alone really well and it'll be very enjoyable for both fans1
Sam and Colby please stop inviting on these guests who do nothing but yap on about nothing. They don't add anything of value and make it hard for us to hear what else is going on
There are youtubers named sailsh and Jordan matter and they are really cool and sailsh has a bff named nidak can you maybe do a video with them?if you can't that's ok!
One of the major issues with Gen Z is their complete lack of social skills and self awareness. That brunette girl in the white hat  just witters endlessly including talking over others. I  could not believe she cut right into that guides story. Nobody wants to hear you luv you're boring and annoying
When during the Estes method in pearls room, Pearl said he stole it, George stole her ring off of her dead body.
I watched night swim when it first came out
please do it with caylus please guys and your content is the best of the best and kan you drop your mearh in south africa please in rustenburg
My townnnnnnnnm😭😭😭
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones through watching this. Thank you for letting us listening to your side of the stories. I'm sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn't have and I give my utmost respect, may you rest in peace.

Wait does Sam have the edger
Wait are they replaced kirs and cilena
Hey… me and Lou have the same last name
I love Sam and Colby but for real they mess with the supernatural without the agnowlagment of the Lord. And also use the His name in vein
It would be awesome to see someone like Markiplier himself go on a ghost hunt with these legendary dudes. Phasmophobia irl for him too!  Hell, *I* would love to do a ghost hunt with them given the chance lmao
He stole from me he stole the ring
You guys should make a video with tubbo or Philza
I’d totally be down to go on a ghost hunt with yall js
Bro at 41:51 Colby literally turns around during the hosting game which you are not allowed to do.
See in your next video yous should try putting flour on the floor and you might catch some ? 😊
Wow how did I miss Sam dry heaving in the video with Selena 🤣🤣🤣
In 16:01 it looked like a shadow went by the plastic covered window.
Wait why is nobody talking about the light that looked like eyes if you guys don’t know pause at 37:57
I did not expect this combo! Amazing!
Me, my family and my loved ones do not claim any negative energy or spirits from the video. I am praying that all of you guys watching the video will stay safe and protected!
Wow so proud of you guys for this level of marketing o:
Great video, just a bit irritating with how Leslie acts especially during the last estus methods, other than that it was a great video
@jj olutunji  @Behzinga  @Zarrkaplays  @TBJZL @Vikstarrr123 @Miniminter  @Wrhoetoshore
@sideman
37:16 Leslie and her intrusive thoughts stay winning 🤣
Anyone know what kind of camera they use for night vision??? TIA
Do not allow any negative energy near me
Do a  collab with these foos
26:30 “my vibrator is off” had me dying😂
Go with the boys!
I hope they take a fan, and the fan is me!

@theboys
@samandcolby I'd love to see you and @markiplier do an investigation
Why is no one commenting on the two sets of eyes in the right door way at 37:57. I literally had tears in my eyes.
I think you guys should take with one of my favourite youtuber the boys and I hope you guys are having a good day^^
Broh bring karly back please

Can you please bring Karl back???
19:37 - john wayne gacy did NOTTTT k*ll people in a clown suit. he would dress up as a clown to surprise kids at like parties and stuff as a side job.   i hear this false info all the time so i just wanted to give y’all a lil true crime fact. 🤪
Around 16:01 did yall see those shadows in the frame behind the girl ?
Speaking about holiday inn one time I had to stay there with my family because I was waiting for our cruise to arrive which was the next day,my mom felt something but didn’t show,I was having a fcking mental break down my mom was like,”oh no there’s nothing there!”.she was lying to make me feel better,but afterwards she told me that there was a male and female spirit and I was like”OH THATS WHAT I FELT-“
Tell me why I had no idea about this town being haunted until now when I live close by 😭
THE SIDEMEN, it would be soo funny especially with ksi
I'm so happy with you guys releasing these awesome videos for us! I just got your merch at my local mall! I can now die happy now!
We need Kubz Scouts to do this with them because that would be the FUNNIEST shit ever 💀
any plan to colab with Sara Wijayanto in future? pretty sure what you have experienced will be much different and makes more sense than your tools. (no offense)

I write a song about you two!!!! Hope u like it , I am not obsessed with you nor am I a crazy stalker. I just love your videos and you guys never fail to make me laugh !!
When are u guys going back to the Sallie house???
Hey Sam and Colby I don’t know if you guys will see this comment but my mom got me some merch for Christmas and it means the most to me because you guys are some of the best content creators that exist.. keep it up guys ! , ur helping me through my Walk as well.
You two have changed my life I was a 0 believer now I'm a 10 believer hi from Macedonia ❤
Literally love Valkyrae and Leslie I’m so glad you collaborated!
I’m not a creator but i want to come on an adventure and ghost hunt!!!
you guys should collabortate with the boys eddie mully josh juicy and narrator oh my god it would be a great video
Leslie annoyed me at the end during the estes method... she was screaming as if she was about to come.
Idk if it’s just me but I think I started to smell alcohol when I actually got to the part!
A video with the boys
you guys literally saved me i love watching your videos so much, thank you
Those who are not afraid of Ghost will always says , " Jai Shree ram🙏 🚩🚩"......
You have to collab with The Boys
What a about went the paranormal palce with "Boys"?
Can you see if you can ask Markiplier to join you guys at the haunted videos
Guys go ghost hunting with the boys like eddie mully juicy narrartor and josh
can u guys collab with kai cenat ???
Love your videos but they have such a time lapse in between them....we kind of forget about you. I wish you did them more often...sad that you don't.
Colby see Mickey Mouse 51:30  51:30
🤨🐍😀
I'm not gonna lie my house literally kept making noises and wires were moving all the time when I was watching this video. Im still watching it and I heard this one chair moving again so I'm just commenting it down here rn. May God be with me and all of you guys 🤣
you know what i find weird is that you guys were talking about the film night swim and as soon as i finished the video, i went straight to facebook and it was all over my feed. i will just confirm this, never even seen the trailer or anything about this film before hand... like wtah 😳😳
I watched night swim tonight it’s so good I recommend watching it 🥳
Kid yelling of joy at 10:00 to 10:08
Sam And Colby I have a big request to ask, if you guys can go to XXXTENTACIONS grave and do your shit there I would appreciate that alot
@Clix
i claim no negative energy from this video
Brittany Broski!!!!
Only the dumbest people on earth believe in ghosts and that ghost hunting is real. Get it together.
23:05  There’s way more deaths at your average hotel than you think. Most hotels probably have at LEAST 1 under their belt. They’re not really newsworthy (natural causes, su1c1de, od), so you don’t hear about it often.
Sam and Colby I was wondering if y’all could make a video with the boys
Do a collab with the boys
At one of the points in the video in the background, there was a shadow that they didn’t see
Ok where was the swim teacher, to not see one the man not come bk up from under water????  That long
Collab with Stephanie Soo??
@yoboipizza do it with them
Is it bad that I kind of wish Sam and Colby would go to hell house?  Btw hope everyone is having an amazing day!!❤
She has to believe more or she wouldn't b getting so scared lol
Fuslie looks like a Korean actress which is Sandara Park
Man I dream of going to haunted places like this, Hopefully one day
Love that they came to Alton. Im from the area, and I've heard many stories. It's nice that they gave it a spotlight. 👍👍👍👊👊👊
PLS BRING TANA MONGEAU & BROOKE SCHOFIELD ONNN
didn’t anyone else feel lightheaded watching this because it made me feel as if I had a massive migraine
collab with the sidemen pretty please
awesome video!!!!!!! yall should go back to the stanley hotel on march 16.
So, it was my birthday the 27th of the fourth 2023, me and my stepmum went to a hotel for my birthday, and she took a video to send to my dad because we were like two hours away from them. When I sat next to her, she looked a bit, shocked, so I was like what’s up. So she showed me the video as I was just walking around doing my own thing my presents. This orb has been falling us and will like it’s probably nothing turns out that someone had died in that hotel. It was our room that the body was found in, but that wasn’t typically all, we had also noticed that things that can’t really fall over or be moved, had fallen over or be moved and not by us. so we think that on my birthday spirit had been there and it had been messing with us or something so yeahhhhh, flipping or also could’ve been my Nan who passed away three months before, but so yeah, my sleeping because of fear…… thank you and love your video you’re the best! 🤠
Do a collaboration with the boys
Take Caspersight especially if you go back to the UK
You should investigate Riverview hospital in Coquitlam British Columbia!! It is really haunted and has even been in multiple paranormal books. Love your videos ❤
Bro…this outro music hits hard
You guys should totally take Markiplier on an adventure! He plays a ton of horror games and even played phasmophobia as well. So I recommend Markiplier and I’d really like to see him in a video <3
Anybody else notice when Colby turned around during the ritual
You guys should go for an Australian tour go to the princess theatre, old Melbourne jail and Beechworth asylum
well gonna watch night swim now
Any one see the eye by the door around 37:50-38:00.
These girls are precious, dont you dare get them hurt
Michael the Mouse
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones through watching this. Thank you for letting us listening to your side of the stories. I'm sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn't have and I give my utmost respect, may you rest in peace.
The most haunted towns in America is pretty much every city in America.
12:57 there’s a girl in a white dress behind coby 🧖🏿‍♀️🙀
Hey Sam and Colby my Sister likes you Colby
Annoying ass reacts from chick in the green sweater. Like relax ain’t that crazy for all that.
U should do a video with a group of youtubers called the boys they just started to do Investigations like this but do not have enough experience doing so, so could you please ask the to do a video that would be the best   Ps: love all of your videos I think the first time I saw you two was on Tifl when u stayed overnight in a trampoline park love u keep up the great work❤
42mins who else saw the person on the wall
Drinking game: take a shot every time sam and Colby say what was that???
@twinparanormal
Do dd Osama and ddot
Ok I'm obsessed with Colby he's cool funny nice and super hot
I’m tagging myself to come to an investigation with you guys!!! Heather Abbott!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Can you please go to the Alberton house in New Zealand or Kingseat Hospital also in New Zealand 😊
RAEEEE
No one has ever thought about that Colby looks like Austin butler but Austin in the Elvis movie
Colby looked back over his shoulder before the box said hotel and entrance!!!😂😂😂😂😂
You guys should really go to lumber baron inn in denver colorado, two girls where murdered there And it’s a very haunted place perfect for investigating!! Like this for sam and colby to see !!  ❤ 👇
This place is only like an hour and a half away from where I live
Hey colby, make a Video with your daughter
I love Colby's smile
Hi sam and colby when you guys were editing this video I dont know if you guys noticed but there was eyes staring at you guys in the dark
Sam and Colby should really do jmancurly 😂 “ also benoftheweek would be so funny
If you look again you can tell who is who with the SLS camera. Because in the final shot before the Estes method, I’m assuming Pearl is the one in the right seat because the legs were crossed like how a female would cross them.
You guys HAVE to come to the May Stringer house in brooksville, it’s near my hometown and it’s supposed to be the most haunted house in Florida!!
the sadness of not being able to watch any horror movies because i pass out from blood 😞
Ok did nobody notice the 2 glowing eyes THAT WAS SO SCARY LOOK AT 37:55 the right where there seems to be a door where you see nothing but black… Sam and Colby explain what it was?
I'll do 1 pushup for every like this comment gets 💀👍
Who else finds these videos annoying asf
I have a suggestion on where you should go next. If you can I found a abandoned Asylum in Columbia SC called Bull street Asylum. If you can I would love if you went there!
I do NOT allow any negative energy, entities, spirits, or anything else to come around me or the ones I love while watching this series. Thank you for letting us hear your story. Jesus fuck I felt shivery when the do not turn around thing happened, it genuinely freaked me out.
i saw the movie night swim last night! it was not scarry tbh good for young teens as horor movies i would say
37:57 Idk if that was the light  in the doorway reflecting or not but it just really freaked me out 😅
You should go back to the Sallie’s house
It would be cool if you guys do a collab with brent and lexi rivera or mark fischbach and ethan nestor
When Sam said Hosting Party, I was like oh shit they are bringing back the OG games!!!
Oml if I was with them there I would have already started to fight spirits before the investigation even began
Y'all should go to the Snedeker house
Stop bringing in random girls they’re ruining you’re authenticity
i think it would be great content to bring ludwig and hasan
Sam and Colby you guys should do a video with the boys. They went to the Conjuring house the lighthouse and many other places that you've been to and their really funny and talk abt you alot or if you want to keep a small amount of people you should invite special ed. He always puts a smile on my face. Plz read this comment🙏🙏🙏
You guys should go to Hotel, Julian and Dubuque Iowa
@Kelsie Daivies. Literally my dream would come true also this is day 1 of asking them to do a vid together!
17:57 😂😂😂
yall should go to the conjuring 2 house
I would actually love for you guys to collab with members of the Sidemen. Maybe Josh and Simon
Sam and colby yall should collab with the boys

When u got the 2nd camera for night vision behind u was blury
Isn’t the most haunted town savannah? (Or even Charleston, New Orleans, or San Francisco) y’all should come to savannah
Sam and Colby always scare me lol 😂😂
37:56 is like a pair of eyes looking around the corner close to the ground
if the well is what is huntening the town then bern it
Go to ashmore estates in IL
Imagine if they did a video with sssniperwolf

I'm so angry because I live in Alton and ahahahhaha trying not to cry rn
There are eyes when they said they can’t look behind them
Omg i love ghost thanks for the best expirience love yall sam and colby
@laurenzside should go ghost hunting with y’all she’s played one to many scary / horror games 😀
You guys should have tana go
Yo Sam and Colby I love your videos so much!!!❤️
Bro I would die to see Tuonto and a Sam and Colby video like it’d be so awesome😭
I want to see markiplier and wade do a video with you guys.
Before you went to the pool for the hosting game a swear I saw a pair of white eyes
Another great video guys!
You should do the tsuji-ura challenge
I would love to see you collab with Markipiler
I like your videos but you guys make way to much sound and almost no investigation
You guys should go to Mansfield reformatory prison in Ohio
Two people want see ghost hunting is mattpat who run game thoery and Markiplier in next video. Of ghost hunting you guys do and awesome videoes!
I think you guys joke around too much and the sprits could find it disrespectful. If you guys toned it down just a little bit you might be able to convince the spirits to do more for you.  Don’t get me wrong, the comedic relief is needed at some moments. But when there’s the loud “ohhhhh” moments and the air horn it can be too much
Idk if you guys still do it but can you ask laurenzside to join you guys or RAVON? Please they are my 2 and3 fav YouTubers you guys are 2
You should do a collab with Twin Paranormal, I think it would be a very funny video
colby looked over his shoulder during the hosting game
I think you should Collab with the boys  they said they would pleaser I’m your biggest fan and there’s please reply if you can thank you.
So do you know when you guys were talking about Charlie I think I saw a flash behind you gut Ys
bring joe bart. it would be so funny & a lot of ppl watch you both
There’s always a little girl that drowned
Sam and Colby should definitely collaborate with the boys! Who agrees? That investigation would be interesting.
Hi
colby u looked behind u ...
35:14- I use these matches, and they are difficult to light. ALL. THE. TIME. They just ended up with the cheapest matches on the market XD
Bring Caylus!
Bro u can see some eyes on when Coby turns
The Boys are challenging yall bro 💀
Things that fuking no YouTuber know is that whispers and hushing sounds make autistic people Wana kill then selfs it's like you hear the most irritating sound and also like some body takes a forg and drag it on porslin plate 🍽️
you guys should definitely make a video with the boys going some place haunted and do an investigation, I love all of your content, and it would be an awesome video
the flash light is made so it turns on due to a temperature 🌡️ cycle but i thinkit works if you have two and try tho make the so caled ghosts make to tur on a specific one. Please stop whispering it makes my ears blead
Sam and Colby should def do a collab with @thekubzscouts
this is so off topic but i dont think colby has ever cried during a video so if i ever see him cry then you know its scary
Who else thinks they should investigate The Cecil Hotel?
Timestamps for easy navigation, enjoy!   00:00 👻 The Mineral Springs hotel in Alton, Illinois, is considered the most haunted small town in America, with a history dating back to the 1100s. 04:32 🏚 The sub-basement, known as the slaughterhouse, was a significant location for paranormal activities, including rumored Satanic rituals. 09:48 🏊 The basement pool is the most active spot, featuring splashing sounds, wet footprints, and a 7-foot tall shadow figure named William. 16:40 👻 Room associated with Pearl S. (Lady in Blue) and George S., where a tragic story of abuse and death unfolds, believed to be haunted. 17:38 🤔 The Soul Asylum Museum within the hotel contains haunted objects, serial killer memorabilia, and real human remains, contributing to the charged energy in the entire hotel. 21:43 🍻 The Mineral Springs Hotel is considered the most haunted town in America, with apparitions like Charlie the painter and Lou Harwood, both associated with the smell of alcohol. 23:35 🔦 Ghost investigation tools include flashlights and a rim pod to detect paranormal activity; the flashlights respond to questions and prompts, potentially indicating the presence of spirits. 24:44 🥃 The group engages in a toast to the spirits, and the flashlights respond by flickering, creating a seemingly interactive and eerie connection with the paranormal. 29:21 👻 The haunted pool, inspired by the movie "Night Swim," is believed to be occupied by several spirits, including a 7-foot tall shadow figure named William and the ghost of a little girl named Cassie. 34:47 🕰 The group initiates a paranormal ritual called the "Hosting Game," restricting them from turning around for an hour, aiming to attract and communicate with spirits. 42:38 🎤 The participants discuss their fear and anxiety during a paranormal experience, expressing it as the scariest thing they've ever done. 44:02 🕯 Binaural beats are used to create a trance-like state during the paranormal investigation. 45:14 👻 A name, "Michael," is seemingly communicated during the session, surprising the participants. 46:25 🧊 The paranormal investigators discuss a past incident involving a white light and an orb that occurred in November. 57:47 🪑 Using an SLS camera, figures are detected in chairs, and the investigators believe they are communicating with spirits named Tina, Harry, Carol, and others. 01:04:20 👻 George and Pearl, the spirits, are revealed to be trapped in a cursed loop, reliving their past and having a conversation during the paranormal investigation. 01:05:01 🔄 The participants are astonished as George and Pearl seem to respond and converse with them, resembling a married couple trapped in a repetitive cycle. 01:05:43 🤯 The conversation with the trapped spirits is considered one of the clearest communication methods experienced during the paranormal investigation. 01:06:42 😱 The pool is identified as the scariest part of the night, with intense fear and dissociation experienced by the participants. 01:07:21 🎢 The overall fear level, especially during the pool session, surpassed expectations, leading to a unique and terrifying paranormal exploration.
I love how the tour guide is so respectful and kind❤
Markplayer and Jacksepcteye should go with you 😊
41:53 Colby just broke the one rule, to not look behind you. And he didn't turn like he showed at the begining of the "party"
My daughter wants to know when the store will restock 😅 apparently she’s obsessed
this was so cringe to watch
Hey I love you're videos also I think you guys should go to pittsford vermont haunted house it is said that place is haunted It served as a hospital for children developing tuberculosis in the early 1900s. or you should go to emilys Bridge
you guys should come visit the Way College in Rome City Indiana! theres lots of crazy creepy things thats gone down there, the basketball court was ised for rituals and a girl with black hair haunts the third floor. they say she drowned herself there. after it was a “christian college” they made it an insane asylum. my mamaw worked there and she could tell you some crazy things as well. i’ve witnessed things myself the last time they ever opened it to the public. it would definitely be a good haunted place to check out!!
Im not scared IM JS SCARED OF THE DAM WOMEN CALLED BLUE WOMEN OKAY
You guys with kmk and Celina spookyboo are the best I can not stop watching u guys as well you are the greatest
Everyone: scared of ghosts Colby: little micky mouse!
Hi Sam a place you guys can go see would be one of the old Victorian homes in Eureka most haunted place there… my cousins had taken me out to see this place and we took pics out side of the house and I felt someone watching me from a window and when I took the pictures something was there..

ok um, didn’t they think the non human entity in the slaughter house was michal? and at the swimming pool the alice box said michal when they asked for a name??? alice box: 45:07  non human entity: 51:49
Get Ted and Schlatt on a ghost hunt, it would be so fucking funny seeing them brake character when they get scared of something
I love when they do hunting stuff like this
You should try moving the chair or flip it around while the ghost is seated on it using the camera with the Xbox Detection feature.
Guys can you visit The Walden inn because my sister works there and her friend that also works there saw a picture that was never there before and nobody knew how it got there then her friend heard a woman’s voice calling her name then she ran then she heard the voice again laughing, then she left. And still nobody knows how it got there.  Edit: sorry I forgot to tell you where it is it’s in Aurora Ohio
Not going to lie I want to see dream and sapnap ghost hunting together
Didnt just colby turn behind his back ??? 41:52
My loved ones, the viewers of this video, and I claim no negative energy from this video. We come with peace, love, and kindness ❤

Sam and Colby u got me through everything like when my gran died,when I thought I wasn’t enough and I just wanted to say thank you
the amount of deja vu i got is insane

they was having couples therapy in pearl’s room
You guys should go to the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods NH.  Joseph died shortly after the hotel was built, and his wife Carolyn then remarried to a French Prince. Although she had remarried, Princess Carolyn continued to spend summers at the hotel. It is believed that Carolyn now haunts the hotel that her first husband built. Specifically, multiple sightings and spooky occurrences have been recorded in her old suite, now guest room #314. What further adds to the haunted feel of this room, is the fact that it still holds Carolyn’s original bed for guest use. There is a photo online wear you can see Carolyn in room 314 in the window. When i went, a bellhop came up to me when i lost my mom. He told me the story and how she now haunts a cabin in the mountains aswell. I ran away because i was scared. I looked back after like 30 seconds and he was gone. No other person was wearing what he was wearing..
Guys, please invite Liza koshy, that would be crazy
37:57 is that eyes in the other doorway?
37:56 ... CANN YOUUUU FREAKIINGGG SEEE 2 PEOPLEEE PEAAKINGGG FROM THE ROOM.!!!!!!!!!!!  ohhhmyyyygaawwddd !!!!!!!

The negative comments thinking this is real is wild 😜😜😅
I think the video snips and pictures Sam and Colby put in the videos randomly are scarier than the videos them self lol.
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and follow me on my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening out side of the stories. I'm sincerely sorry if I made any glances i shouldn't have and may everyone give you respect! May you rest in peace
26:30 my vibrator is off 💀
‘Why would a woman die or cardiac arrest and have been to hospital 14 times if there was nothing wrong with her?’   Idk maybe because all that shows that there was something wrong with her lol I can’t believe I used to think you guys were legit
Invite jay costura “the nostradamos of the philippines “

omg my name is cassie- when sam started talking about the little girl that drowned I wasn't expecting to hear my name 😭
i would love to see the sturniolo triplets on here!
I wanna see a collab with grian and Scott Smajor/ dangthatsalongname as they’re some of my favorite YouTubers but I’m not sure if they’d be down or such 😞
@sam and Colby yall should bring ishowspeed with you on the next adventure
How are yall still saying: if you didn’t come from TikTok you’re allowed to like this comment.. nobody watches TikTok no more 💀
This video was better than night swim. Honestly, I think most of what people feel while  investigation is just the mind, cause just hearing a noise while I'm home alone will give me chills down my body or the feeling on the neck whenever I'm just paranoid so it's easy to get that feeling and a real paranormal feeling mixed up. Now I want someone who strongly doesn't believe to give it a try
This was too good, y'all should get @iberleezy on one of these 🤣🤣❤
i feel shaky :(
This is probably the most chaotic intro and beginning to their video that I’ve seen in a long time and I’m living for it 🤣🤣 only 3 minutes in a just ✨C H A O S✨ 🖤🖤
Can you go to the Cecil hotel with Chris and Selena
i followed u on tiktok
You guys should collab with the sturniolo triplets 🤪🤪🤪
Congratulations on 11m subscribers ❤❤❤❤

Take LaurenZside ghost hunting!!!!
TAG @doublegg2079 Best YouTuber
Why didn’t they come to our party? “Tomb” maybe saying because the location (pool) is like a tomb?
Dear Sam and Colby, Hi my name is Hecshanelis and I'm 11 years old, I was wondering if I could be part of one of your videos, me and my friend Layla are fans of your videos and we live in Chester, I was wondering if you guys could check if there are haunted houses around Chester PA, it would mean a lot, if you see this can you comment back thank you❤🙏.*i eas seeing shadow figures in my house and in your videos*
Sam and colby i pray you will read this abigail was never there its a demon deceiving yall jesus told us in the bible familiar spirits are demons the reason why nothing bad ever seemed to happen was the demons deceiving yall❤   well if I'm wrong I wasted nothing because I got peace and joy from him, but if you're wrong you wasted your entire life!! ❤️🎉 And demons love when people believe that lie that God doesn't exist and they love it when people don't know they are there ❤I copy n paste this everywhere❤   And no one talks about repentance, God will never lower his standards to be okay with your sins, sins is very serious in the eyes of God hes holy and righteous and it seperates us from him❤    Demons exist, and the devil comes to steal kill and destroy and uses people to do so❤   Btw telling the demon to stay doesnt do anything unless you have the holy spirit you arent safe.   People: okay please stay this is your place❤  Demon: okay People: **leaves**  Demon: **Goes with them anyway**   Demons arent gonna make it obvious they are there so yeah.   Demons are fallen angels that uses the form of our passed away loved ones to make us believe ghost exist and the souls of the person we knew still remains here❤❤    Astrology is demonic before my relationship with God I would always do zodiac signs literally just a bunch of sins put into each one I bet if everyone was sinless zodiac signs wouldn't make sense and literally a cover up for demons❤    Hearts are deceitful above all things, listen to God❤  Depression can be a demon you may need deliverance❤  God said unless you're born again spiritually u will not enter the kingdom of heaven also God doesn't judge us by our good works he's judging us by our sins Gods standards are so high he's that HOLY saying oh my God is using Gods name in vain it's called blasphemy ❤   To get to heaven you must believe with all your heart that Jesus died and rose again paid full price for your sins repent and receive his Holy spirit.    YouTubers I recommend  Impact videos ministries   David diga Hernandez   IsaiahSaldivar   Mapalo  DLM christian lifestyle  Billy garham   Danial adams   Living waters   Okay now pray this to be saved and to get to heaven pray out loud   Jesus I confess that you are my lord and savior  I believe in my heart that God raised you from the dead I ask to receive your holy spirit and I repent of my sins with your help❤ by faith in  your word I receive salvation now Thank you for saving me! I am now reborn a christian a child of almighty God I am saved thank you Jesus!  *Be genuine when praying this*  Watch videos on how to receive Gods holy spirit on YT  God creates Jesus redeems The holy spirit changes  Now our good deeds and works we think are good are like filthy rags in the eyes of God   Things to get rid of in your home   1sage 2dream catchers 3crystals 4crystal ball 5ouija board 6 tarot and angel cards 7religious statues 8demonic movies music or video games 9soul times items 10pornography    Now like a theif robbing a store, demons won't make it obvious they are there unless they have to.   Now know you can't save yourself Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life   You have insurance on your house if it ever caught on fire which rarely happens but when it comes to your soul, you play with it like you have forever to make your choice which you don't   150k+ people Die everyday and you never know when it may be you  God spent 9 months shaping and forming you before you were born but only 7 days on earth you're fearfully and wonderfully made beautiful in the eyes of God❤  Don't waste time Hearts are deceitful above all things ask God for wisdom and understanding we are just tiny humans with a 3 pound brain and our imaginations cannot go beyond what we already know❤   Your souls is so valuable both Satan and God want it but it's your choice who you will serve   You serve the devil when you  Lie Hate Blasphemy Disobey Lazy Gossip Gluttony Wanting what others have cause what God has for you is for you he will never deliver your male to someone else's house Hate  And unforgivness  And cussing murder and more  And once you die, you're locked with your choice of where you're spending eternity God doesn't care about you doing more good then bad cause he's not judging that God never said that's the way to heaven  So who's lying you or God? Be serious about this❤  God is holy and righteous God is love  So either you would play around because you don't believe hell exist or you don't believe you're going there but the bible makes it very clear   The path to destruction is wide and easy many are on it the path to eternal life is hard and nerrow very few find it and to get into heaven u can only enter through the nerrow gate❤  You dont have to wait until you die to know if youre going to heaven you can know right now 100% where youre going❤   Satan doesnt rule hell this is a myth when lucifer known as satan now became prideful and rebelled against God he took many angels with him Demons are fallen angels we live in a spirital and physical world so hell was made for punishment for satan and his angels and the reason why people go there is because they Align themsleves with the devil in SIN!  Sin separates us from God and the wages of sin is death if youre found guilty with one sin on judgment day you will not enter the kingdom of heaven so the thing is We us humans broken Gods law and jesus paid the fine! So the good news is you dont have to go to hell if you accept him as your lord and savior!   God offered us eternal life as a free gift and you receive it by faith! You dont have to work for it you dont have to pay all you have to do is receive it by faith❤   Don't expect Gods best when you always give him your least don't reject him anymore let him come in and change your life❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i wish they used the sls during estes

1:04:00 nah cuz the ong was so funny i swear 😭
Rae and Leslie doing the most terrifying thing of their lives    Sam and Colby: buy our merch!!!
The most terrifying thing about that town is how steep the roads are and driving on them during ice
you need to go ghost hunting with ranboo !
Your not ment to “practice  mid ritual ,each strike including the same match would count as an attempt
Im not gonna watch this video yet I just wanted to point out that you didnt finish the conjuring for a week?!?!

You should do a live video
When I’m in my living room the door to my basement slams exactly at 3:33 am😢😨😭
Hey Sam and Colby you guys should come to decatur illinois and go to the Avon theater I think its the most haunted theater in decatur it was built in 1916 or you can try and go to the Greenwood Cemetery its the most haunted Cemetery in decatur but you would have to break into there cause they closed it down cause kids kept disappering they have a chair that if you sit on it apperntly three things can happen .
Who else would LOVE to see jack do this?!?!?
A good place for both of y’all to explore is Moore bridge in del valle Texas

Sam And Colby You Help The Beverly Halls Family A Curse Alien Statue won't Stop Haunting Them
It be great if y'all collabed with Kelly Wakasa and Luke Eich or maybe some members of Smosh
To be compeltely honest, I watch/listen ghost hunting videos to fall asleep. But I was so entertained by Lesie and Rae that I ended up having a difficult time falling asleep. It's quite refreshing seeing them _"outside"_ ... in the dark, looking for ghosts. 😂
go to the house in the uk conjuring 2 is based on
@corykenshin
If Sam and colbey aren’t faking their videos comment on this video Sam and colbey
That outro was sick

Please come to India..There are many romours regarding haunted places in India..❤
Orbs is that bright light he saw going down the stairs. They’re not small little things they size anywhere between a soft ball to what he said 6 ft even 10 it’s very rare to see an orb. You can tell it’s an orb because it emits its own light. And it’s said to be “memorizing” like you “can’t look away” orbs are not small it’s a manifestation of energy. It’s going to be big and noticeable. Nothing small like a bug, dust, or even trick of the camera.
1:46 love how he just bashes the camera in his crutch😂😂😂 good start
Am i the only person that spotted ghost and eyes popping out?😭😨cuz like i literally saw so many 😭.Amazing video like always😋🤩

THE STANLEY: USA's Most Haunted Hotel (Our Return) has reached 500K likes so please do a STANLEY Hotel with amanda again
Well I think  some follow me bc my house was not haunted before I started but now its haunted
I ghost hunt for fun and ghosts are definitely real I saw a box move from one corner of the room to the other and I was alone no guides and it was dark and I got freaked out and now my house is haunted bc ghosts follow me home most  ghosts that follow me home are evil so...yeah 1 like = 1 pray that I don't die
@samandcolby  can you go to a haunted place with @The Boys ?
okay so nobody saw the eyes at 37:56?
whether anyone believes this or not that's fine. A month or so ago I had a dream about the front of this Zumiez store (we don't have them here is Australia), except since I'd never seen the front of this store it just said Sam and Colby in the same font. I even remember dreaming of walking through clothes isles asking sarcastically "so how it feel selling clothes in an actual store like the big brands". It is so crazy to see all the clothes and even the front of the store in real time and awake.
EXCUSE MEEEEEE WHOO WHO SPONSERED !!!????!!! WHAAAAAT tf
Sometimes these vids are scary just to watch so for you guys to actually be there you have my full respect. Keep up the good work ❤
https://www.youtube.com/@lifeisbeautiful8734
I love how they were all freaking out with the matches 🤣🤣😭😭
OMG MY NAMES COLBY TOOO
I would love to see Amber Scholl with you guys. I don’t think she would ever agree to do this but i think that would be fun.
NGL the guide kinda looks like tony starks
Hey hilikeit

Hi
Hey
@samandcolby was that cousin It from the Addams family at the start 😂😂😂😂😂😂
yo did colby really drink that jacks?????????????
Sam n colby had way too much fun terrifying the girls
It's really wholesome to see your channel grow so big since when it started 9 years ago
These guys are my favorite youtubers ❤
I'd love to do something like this because I am a 100% believer in the supernatural
37:57 where colby was moving near stare case next to that there is a room over there at the coner of the doorway u can see like a 4 pairs of glowing eyes looking at them . its might be just me or its really the shadow fig idk let me know your opinion
How do y’all get disorders by the one and only universal pictures

Have one with Eddie vr plz he also explores haunted places with his friends me and my cousin would love to see this colab, btw he knows who guys are 😁😁😁😁😁ppplllzzzzz like if u wanna see this👇
Bro the closest Zumiez to my house is across Asia ⭐️
I would love to see you guys do a ghost hunt video with The Boys
@SamAndColby i want to investigate with you guys
Its not the ghosts that are scary, its the random pop up photos while I watch this at 3 in the morning.
go with nick eh 30 it will be your first family friendly video
Sorry, I'm a bit confused by this video but understand the need to hype. The spider is a daddy-longlegs and is common but not poisonous. I thought you may have gone to the Stanley but the odd smells, touches, voices, and motions were personally experienced at my original Walmart store which was built near an old burial ground. Please check out Colorado's hauntings, we have a lot of history and even a prostitution museum. Sorry, Casa Bonina has not improved.
The boys said they would love too meet up with you guys
All of the rest is awesome stuff! I do think the SLS was because of the chairs, maybe the fabric. Only the metal folding chair didn't have a figure and the two fabric ones had the figures non stop. So I do believe that is the reason for the SLS.
Pls do a video with benoftheweek in hunted places of inda 🙏🙏
I CANT STOP LAUGHING AT COLBY WHEN HE SAID BÉBÉ 😭😭 40:05
Sam and colby should colab with brittany crabb
I swear to God I saw two eyes whenever y'all turned in the hosting game in the doorway a while after you said welcome in 37:57
As my wife and I were watching this video, during the Estes method in pearls room our TV shut off, her YouTube doesn’t want to play the video anymore, and our dog looked up from being dead asleep as if something was above him…WTF
Loved this!!!❤ You two have come so far! Have subscribed for a long while. Gone back and watched what I missed, including your comps , Celinaspooky and Kris. Love to see your next adventure! BTW HAPPY NEW YEAR GUYS! The Ladies were wonderful! They need to start their own Ghost Hunting Enterprise! Empaths to the core!!!❤ Beautiful and Fantastic energy right there! Blessings Babies! Loved to see the cleansing afterwards, ALWAYS stay safe❤❤❤
I do not let any negative spirits affect me or follow me. They can’t get close to my family. I don’t want that anyone get close to me or my family. Thanks for the stories you told us
Sam & Colby playing the hosting game brings back memories 😭😭
Bring the boys in…
U guys should do a collab with ‘the boys’ they also do ghost hunting videos
I am not a spider killer           I swear___😐
Hi
I wish for a @deestroying collab, my two favorite youtubers in one vid
43:25 the chair beside rea moved yea that shit is cursed
Hey Carol are you friendly😭😭😂😂 poor rae
34:17 that door 100% closed on its own
When I was little at my house I lived in from like 6 years old to 9 years old I used to play with my neighbor outside and when I used to head home I would she black figures running in the yard and I didn’t know anything and when I was in the living room I used to see figures outside run or I would glance and see something and the house would always make weird noises at night but I’m 13 now and I live in a different house that is fine and nothing weird happens at night 👍🏽  Edit: also in my old house me and my older cousin were in the hot tub outside and we were looking out into the woods and we say something move and it was weird I thought it might had been a deer but my cousin was freaked out bc she had just heard of this serial killer that wasn’t to far from us like a 2 hr drive but we never figured out what it was I still think I was a deer but it could’ve been something paranormal considering what I used to see outside
Sykkuno and lily pichu should go on a real ghost investigation
I wanna see you guys take Hasan ghost hunting lol
Can you go back to the witches forest ❤❤❤❤❤😂 please i have cacer and the docs said they dont know how long i have left to live and the last video i want to see from sam and colby is the witches forest
You should go back to the Stanley hotel and play red door yellow door
Tall chick was so jealous of the other one
Ik this is really random but I would love to see Louie Castro be in one of these videos😂😂
ghosts and alcohol... love it... not me takin shots with you guys lol
Damn they got a sponsor from UNIVERSAL
❤
Hey sam and colby ì like your videos but i just watched a video of you two walk8ng round a suoermarket with a saxamaphone. Fat shameing people
Why is nobody talking about the eyes at like 37:55-37:59😭😭😭😭
plssss consider doing a collab with the sturniolo triplets ik they’re reactions to haunted shit would be hilarious
I do not allow sprits to come follow me or my loved ones through watching this video . I’m glad I got to learn more about you. May you rest in peace.
I think my house is haunted because I asked the ghost to touch the cat ball and it went off also I see figures all the time
I would love to see Swol go on a Sam and Colby adventure
Shout out to Hannah bell your the best person I have ever met
YO SAM AND COLBY IT WOULD BE CRAZY ABSOLUTELY CRAZY IF YOU GUYS GOT IN TOUCH WITH ED AND LORRAINE WARREN ITD BE LITERALLY HISTORICAL
Did you guys see the eyes at 1hour 6 minutes and 33 seconds at the door to the left
I’d love to see Sam and Colby play phasmophobia and I’m not sure why
If you see this be really careful with things you can’t identify
The first ghost HAS to be Chad from @staygoldenponyboiii ‘s videos 😂
England trip and Colab with the sidemen
This reminds me of the Hotel we have in my town not so far from Alton. The Original Springs Hotel. We’ve had investigators there before but they debunked it all and said the spring water is what caused all the energy, but if you talk to past employees there, they all share their own experiences including my grandma who worked there back in the day.
Michel is an arc angel
that’s the closest you’ve ever been to my hometown, crazy
Hey, here’s an idea for a haunted video, but I have no idea if it’ll work so if it doesn’t, sorry for the east of time. Anyways, you guys should try to do a video at Farrar a haunted school house in Bondurant Iowa. I went there once for ghost hunting, the other times were weddings. If you can’t get a way to film here, then really I am sorry for wasting the time 😅
I remember driving past that building on the way to school
I love you colby and l like you colby😀😘💋😍
13:37 That's a lotta stairs 😭
Can't wait for Miyoung's turn LOL.
Sammm and colllbyyyy I got merch from zumissss❤
16:00 Shadow in the window! Shaped just like a person
😳😳😳
I've noticed all shadow figures tend to be 7-8 ft tall... I have theory that because shadows can be "warpped" like sometimes your shadow is real small and sometimes it's ridiculously long.... I dunno if that makes any sense 🤔 but that's my theory
you guys should go to the Eldred House
I’m the 200k like
Can u plz give me a shout out
I love u guys u are the best
i love both of these duos so so much!
33:53  It was probably that tall shadow figure named William  I think hi got mad because you didn’t put his name to on the invitation
Can you go to the witches' forest again.  Just a request  .
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Are we not gonna talk abt how Colby said baby he said “BÉBÉ”👺
can you start the background music AFTER the crash sound, jeez guys, cant here nada
I COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING WHEN ONW OF THEM WENT “Micheal?…..u😭” 🤣🤣🤣😂😂 53:10

You gotta take twin paranormal
These two were great - this was a wild video!
Sam and colby please investigate bevery halls home.
Y’all should investigate like a Spanish demon or something like that please
I’m from Alton/Godfrey! I hope you got to see more than mineral springs while you were here!
You have to ask jynxzi to go on an investigation
When they where talking about pearls husband at 16:01 there was a shadow behind the girl in the window or whatever that is 😂😂😂😂
Sam and Colby, a creator I’d like to see you collaborate with his Mark, known as YouTuber Markiplier, he’s a gamer too lol but anyways, I think he’d do well with you guys and you would have fun, if you could contact him and ask him to collaborate, it would make me and other Sam and Colby and markiplier fans happy 😄
When I wa5ched this, it was Jan. 5th lol.
Dream pls
Could you please go to the old Melbourne jail in Australia 😊
I saw the movie night swim today cause I asked my dad cause I saw this video and that’s why I went to go see it and it wasn’t that fucking scary at all but it was fun, did y’all watch it?
Love y’all 💜💜💜👻💜👻💜👻💜💜👻💜💜👻💜👻💜💜👻💜👻💜💜👻💜💜👻💜👻👻💜💜💜
Imagine bringing mr beast crew. It will be fun seeing carl and jimmy running around
24:45 is my fav part
When they where in the pool the thing sed Michael and then the talk about Michael in the Slater house didn't they?
I do not allow spirits to come follow me or my love ones through watching this video. I am thankful that I got to learn about your story. May you rest in peace and my prayers go out to those who lost their lives in this hotel. Many risings.
We need kris a spooky boo to make the video none scary
I Forgot how scary the pictures you guys chooses are scarier then the video 😅
26:30 valkyrae what????

If love for these guys to find one of the most haunted places in my state (Vermont).

@sturniolotriplets
To be fair, the minute I tell myself “don’t turn around” I get freaked out, that is placebo effect 🤷🏼‍♀️
we  cant just skip over sams just chicken joke like that

Sam and Colby you've been to the most haunted hotel in America but have you gone to the most haunted hotel in Mexico I hope you can go to Mexico and visit the hotel Posada del sol it's located in taxco Mexico. This hotel is said to be haunted by the ghost of a former owner who died in a fire. Guests have reported seeing his ghostly figure in the hallways and feeling a cold presence in their room. I hope you   can go with kallmekris and Celina spooky boo because y'all are so funny and I love this duel I'm also a huge fan so good luck.😅
Hi Sam and Colby, I've been a fan for 6 years. I love your videos
Hi Sam and Colby can you please do a collab with Lucas and Marcus 😊
I’d love for Charlotte Dobre to join you guys!😊😋
Yall should make a video game that us followers can play
I want them to encounter an autistic ghost
I believe that my grandmother's house is haunted, and wanted to do an investigation on it. Are there any tips you have for a beginning paranormal investigator?
I really want to a episode with the sturniolo triplets
I wish i could be in one of your videos
I love your videos
If you love Sam and Colby like this comment ❤
No way dude Alton is not that far from me that’s so crazy
😭😭😭 i had seen a fu-cking shadow entity 😭
Not them being wrong about gacey
i just watched this and my dog started to act weird like she saw something so she is freaking me out but sadly i cant watch the inire video😬
who else remembers the original hosting party 3AM challenge
Not Colby turn and watch behind him when they are not supposed to in the pool during the "party" 41:48
the transistionat 29 was crazy
11/6/37 😈

I HATE PARANORMAL VIDEOS THUMBNAILS!!!
👿👿🤜🤛😇😇
conjuring 2 house when?
Take Brittany bro ski on a hunt that would be funny
The fact that i almost comit suicide a month ago but you two saved my life and i am very thankful for it i hope that you Will be proud of what you did  and i love you for it ❤❤
Please do a collab with the Boys. They've been getting into investigating a lot more seriously recently and I really think you guys could help push them in the right direction xx
John Wayne Gacey did not kill people in his clown suit. It was a side job he did. And he murdered young men not little boys.
I love ur guy's videos! keep up the good work and have a great day!...also you guys should do another friends choose ur bae.
One of the best videos to end the year 😂❤❤
Please tell me that I am not only one that oh Jack Daniels and went mötley Crüe and went crap I might have a new hyper fixation with motley Crue now I feel stupid.
THEY DID A GHOST THING IN ILLUINOIS?!
You guys should get distractable to go ghost hunting with you. Its markiplier lordminion and muyskerm. They are a popular podcast , and i think it would be really funny.
I really want to see JSchlatt go in a ghost hunt
(casual flex) got me laughing🤣
You should go to the McCune Mansion in Utah with KallMeKris and her sister alyssa
You should collab with kallmekris and her sister Alyssa
lmao you guys need to take eddie on one of these (@special edd) i would love to see it 😂
This video has all of it! The fun, The scare, the fear and it felt for this video complete! I LOVED wachting this video in bed so i didn´t think all th time about my 6th day of the flu.... This makes me feel better! I Had fun while watching! Thanx!!  And The best wishes for 2024 for everybody!!  Make this year better, more spooky and more alive than 2023!
Man I want to do the Estes method so bad. I have high empathy and have had several paranormal experiences in several locations. I'd love to go ghost hunting with you guys and would be up for being along in the dark or any other challenge. <3
okay hear me out, bring back rae, but what if you explored with her friend group at a bigger spot? i think that would be so entertaining, but i also just love her friend group.
Collab with Christine Snaps from TT. Her reactions and monologues are hilarious and I think it would be hilarious to watch her somewhere haunted.
SAM AND COLBY DO A COLAB WITH KELSI DAVIS PLEASE
Imagine the spider they killed was a reborn spirit of this hotel..   Edit: love these guys thanks for a great 2023!
You guys should come investigate fort Atkinson wi supposed to be like really spiritual and haunted and werewolf, sightings, and stuff like that
37:58 zoom into the room on the right. there are two sets of eyes like peeking.
I’m like hella lateee but I bought the sweater Colby was wearing here ! Best money I’ve spent on their merch
@eddievr you need to meet these two
You guys should take @Erika Angel to investigate.
Real life phasmophobia! Let’s goooo
I hate the fact that the random images you guys put up in your videos scare me so much more then the actual video
Sam and Colby I have extended your offer to some of my favorite content creators (domplays and Hayden green) I think yall should get into touch with them to do a video like this I 10000000% believe that it would be a banging video they are your run of the mill gamers but they are always playing horror games and ghost games so this is their chance to come into the field and see what paranormal investigations are all about dom replied to my comment on his channel and he seems Hella interested in this idea
We need Larry and his best friend
hi sam! I need to tell you that my moms and my dads restaurant is haunted in Georgetown co
I’ve used those matches before they SUCK 😂😅
Her vibrator you is off???
two of my favourite sides of youtube coming together C: so happy
Hi, I’m not sure if you have places planned out or if you ask your followers to suggest places but if you do, I recently heard of the Amityville Horror. I watched a Netflix documentary on it and it says it’s about this kid who had been possessed or told things that had caused him to kill his entire family. This had also been investigated by Ed and Loraine Warren. Thank you and love your content.
SAM COLBY!!! THE BOYS THAT WOULD BE MY FAVORITE COLLAB🙏🙏
DID U GUYS SEE THAT IN THE WINDOW😊
Mindseed tv better
Go to Shepton Mallet Prison in England
i feel like grian and impulse would be great guests for one of these investigations, would be super entertaining
People who have been to Alton Illinois before  👇
Did anyone else see eyes when they invited them for the party?
Drugs
Sam and Colby please can you collab with thinknoodles and fgteev dud
Why are they getting wasted in somewhere haunted

Happy birthday Colby
I’ve been watching y’all videos since 2017
This is a banger I enjoy y’all videos

Maybe you could do one with a LOT of people in a big haunted place and you all split up😂
WE NEED @MOiSTCR1TICAL HERE WITH YOU
I love how if I spelt it right but how Lou has the same name as me and it is said the same but mine is Liu
I love how colbys standing at 41:41
You guys NEED to invite Loey Lane on a investigation that would be iconic
Is William Afton the tall black man😂😂
I maybe trippin but did anyone notice at 16:00 in the middle window it looks like a man or a figure climbing up something??
The subtites said "My vibrator is off" at 26:28

I need more Rae and Leslie ghost hunts!  They were SO good at it; can't believe it was their first time doing something like this.
Please could you bring the boys pls
i liked the like +1 Camera! it gives me phashmophobia vibes
HAPPY NEW YEAR SAM AND COLBY!!! Sorry for the 5 day delay. I hopw y'all explore some even more scarier places this year, like the Cecil Hotel, which you should explore
at 22:11 there was a weird figure running in the background
I do NOT allow any negative energy around me thank you
When there were doing the party the name micheal came up after they closed the party they went to basment and they said the spirt or negative energy could be named micheal so was he with them at the party? Cause they did the thing wrong
When they talked about the Alice box saying michael and November I remembered michael the Angel and how the guide talked about a guardian Angel I pieced it together that the Angel michael saved the guide and the people on November
SAM AND COLBY PLS BRING KREEKCRAFT WITH YOU
i have a question guys do u like worship jesus or anything?
Maybe they should try to find some haunted buildings or smth in Denmark? Even tho in 2019 an old building was torn down due to being about 40 - 60 years old and on the edge of collapsing- tbh i'd love to see them try to find a building in Denmark, it would be one of the most complex tasks i swear- also stay safe hellspawns!
Rugg
Okay so, at my house, we have spirits aswell, the bread flies from one side to the other in my kitchen, my baby sisters toys turn on out of nowhere aswell.😭
I kinda wanna see quackity and wilbur do this
The scariest part of the video for me were the spiders
I am very new here and just watched the video where you explored the abandoned Wal-Mart from 5 years ago and I just subscribed to the channel love you guys
Petition to get sam and Colby to do a video with Tubbo and Tommy or Dream and George 👇🏻
Do another one with them
I wonder how a video with TheBoys will go 😭😂
Imagine watching this while going night swimming
please take tana and brooke!!!
idk ab other ones but the motel my fiances mom works at, a lot of people have died there. at least 20 that I know of and it's not a big motel either. I feel stuff watching me when I'm walking alone and night and stuff. it's kinda creepy
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO TO WINDSOR CASTLE(Henry VIII supposedly haunts it) OR LONDON TOWER (maybe anne boleyn haunts it?)
Sam and colby i am a HUGE FAN ❤️❤️and i love you guys 👍👍
Can u do it with the boys
When a Hunted place has a lady that wears a rinbow dress Sam and colby : THE LADY IN RINBOW💅
The more ghost hunting channels I watch I realise how much better they are than Sam and Colby. You guys are literally just clout chasers, that's why you need a special guest every episode.
At 57:32 you can see an orb like thing near the flashlight on the top...
i do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around and too follow me or my loved ones through watching this. thank you for letting us listen to your side of the stories. i apologise if i made any glaced i shouldnt have and i give you my utmost respect and kindness, may you rest peacefully.
Gurl, Im gonna try summoning The Babadook in my house bc I'm bored :> and besides the movie was awesome and Sam and Colby have taught me to be afraid of the pictures in their videos instead of ghosts ✨💅
37:58 did no one else see the glowing eyes in the door..?
Hey Sam and Colby earlier this year I went on a field trip to Jacksonville a haunted and very ghosted town at night u might need tk ask permission but it’s a fun cool place and was creepy when I went as it started raining the second we stepped foot into the town and this was after everyone left
Can I get your snap?
The Slaughter house looks like five nights at candy's 2
Please come to my house
I’m so glad I can see four of my favorite content creators in one video!
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening our side of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may have everyone give you the upmost respect! May you rest in peace.
31:37 Sam making that funny noise in the background 💀💀💀💀💀💀
I have slight question.  What the hell is thatt Shadow at 16:00 minutes? Like I don't thinks it's either Colby or Sam.

I am so so so so sorry I really regret what I did I’m so sorry😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
A few comdians would be good bring Joe and joey diaz lol
Would like to see Sam and Colby trying out Phasmophobia VR
On the video on YouTube if you guys say that you do drugs on the Omegle video and this is just me telling everyone and I think it’s very unhealthy😕😕😕
Y’all should colab with Kelsey Davies
I like the videos but all the added sound effects when something is said or heard is annoying.
There's a shadow 16.04
i live here 🐐
37:53 Pair of eyes glowing .. There is something watching them through the dark, a door to the right
Hi Sam and Colby I'm a huge fan of yours in the UK and i would love to do a ghost hunt with you because you have made me believe in ghosts so i would love to be part of one of your ghost adventures

“He stole it” SHE MEANS THE RING OMG !!!! I bet he took that ring and did something to it so that’s why she is cursed now 😢😢 so sad girlie just wants peace
Just woke up from a dream where Sam and Colby had a broken car window, car engine / gear shift troubles, and were terrified of the place they were at (lots of ladders) stay safe out there
Bring SSundee and Sigils
I really love your video's. I have a kind of weird suggestion maybe you should do a collab with The Boys maybe this is weird.  I think you could try to do it once.
we need leslie on estes next time!!
Did Sam even Know that there was a Shadow in the Window right in front of Him?
Y’all should do the hill house in mineral wells Texas
that fact that i live in alton IL and i didnt know any of this except that alton is the most haunted small town....  i literally live down the road from the mcpike mansion and the mineral springs hotel is only about 5 mins away... i couldve met them :(((((
I do not allow any negative spirits or energies come around me or follow me and my loved ones.  I do not claim any negative energy in this video.  I am truly sorry for any glances I have accidentally made and may you rest in peace.  Thank you and good night.

It hasn't even been a year and there already over the shit that happened at the conjuring
1:08:42?
I once got into a verbal argument with a spirit at a local graveyard when I was using a spirit box, hilariously I lost but to this day still my favorite thing to have happened on a ghost hunting trip. XD
40:06 why is nobody talkin about how Colby said BéBé 🤪
The thing about rituals is that, there is no “practice ritual” you either do it or you don’t, talking abt how yall gonna do it is fine but there’s no practice, so yeah yall did the ritual wrong. I wonder what would’ve happened if the ritual worked… that would be scary asf
Im 10 years old and my family never bought a new house but sometimes i think my house is haunted whitch its made 11 years ago and the only reasons i think is haunted its bc sometimes i see extra shadwos and feel like someone is staring at me at late at night whitch made me scared😢😢
Scary video

yesterday i saw a girl in a black hoodie at night and she looked kinda faceless (though that might have been me because my eyesight at night is kinda bad)and she was playing with her fingers and the looked really anxious,also my dad looked right at her and didn’t say anything about her and acted like she was invisible

Hey Sam and Colby today is my birthday and I've been watching yall for 1 1/2 years now. It would mean the world to me if yall said "happy bday" I'm so thankful for yall and proud of how far you guys have come. Thank you for saving me. I am so glad I found yall and if I hadn't found you a year ago I don't know where i would be. Keep up the great work.

Can I go ghost hunting with u guys
Hi Sam and Colby I think u should take Ryan trahan the would be awesome!

When you go to Australia pleeeease check out Kapunda in South Australia, if you look it up it’s the most haunted town in Australia!  No one ever goes there or takes any notice because it’s not Melbourne or Sydney
Hey, so my girlfriend has loved yall and yalls content for a really long time, and she wants to meet you two, I know it might be a long shot but is there any way I can make that possible, im willing to pay whatever it takes, it just might take me a while to save up, its been her dream and i really want to make it happen if possible
Why don’t you go to banded toys rus
You guys should definitely collab with abnormal club
Valkyrae!? Out of all content creators i know She was definitely not someone i would've ever imagined with you guys
PLS BRING BACK DANGMATTSMITH !!
Grizzy and Puffer doing this together would be awesome
collab with SMii7Y please
Collaboration with the boys
you should go somewhere with caseoh
Can you make another video please
This might be a reach - but when you guys were in the pool and the name Michael came through, the first thing I thought of was the Archangel Michael when Rae mentioned the white light that the guide encountered. Just thought I’d share. It was really weird for that to be the first thing to come to my mind, almost like I was being told to share that theory with y’all. Pretty left field, but a possibility?
Im sorry these girls are annoying
Who has been to the Napier prison 👇👇👇  Sam and cobly can you giys please go investigate the Napier prison for me because i jnow it is haunted i could feel all the energy please reply if you could. I would really love it 😍😍😊😊
THE FUCKING EYES IM THE BACKGROUND I LTERALLY STARYED CRYING FOR NO REASON
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAY COLBY
I'm definitely not the only one, but every time I see you guys posted a video it brings me so much joy. I love you guys so much! You helped me get through 2023 and I can't wait what happens this year! Take care and stay safe! ❤
@sidemen please!!! two groups of boys, two different locations!
The fact that they are so close to where I live is insane. 🫠🖤

I do not claim any negative energy from this video. Neither does my family or any of my loved ones. I apologize for any accidential glances to all the spirits in this video. Thank you for sharing your story with us and all you entities in this video deserve all respect and kindness. Thank you.
Them talking about popcorn 🍿 well they are deathly scared 😂😂😂
Im pretty sure im gonna have a sweet dreams mixed with nightmare 😊
Valkyrae? Really?
We gotta see a collab with you guys and the sturnolio triplets, give the people what they want 😋
Yall see those eyes in the pitch black room by the trash can  towards the end
Mr.beast collab
SAM AND COLBY YOUR MY FAV YTBERS ❤❤❤
The crossover a never expected but I love
I love in southern Ohio.  We only have one mound left because the idiots tore out the other identical one and the rest of the earth works that was here.  Part of it still exists and is in northern Kentucky.  It was huge.  Thankfully the idiots who came here didn't get to the serpent mound.   They tore out so many of them throughout the states though. Ugh.
I welcome and encourage any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me throughout watching this. I can't speak for my loved ones though. Ask em yourself.
BRINGGG EDDIE VR FOR 2024 PLEASE!!! OR BRING THE  BOYS
From small investigations to getting sponsored by the Universal.. You both have come a long way and so proud of you guys
bring on @jeffree star
please please please please please try and get jeffree star to come to one, i feel like he would be SO entertaining and LOVE it and make friends with the ghosts/entities
I love you guys but bring back the old sam and colby
this vid was so good but for 2024 i think u guys should try to get either nailea devora and larray on together or the sturnilo tripllits ( idk how to spell their name sorry )
8:54 notice how Colby reacts before the crash even happens
Would literally kill to see Jschlatt, TedNivisom, and/or Charlie slimecicle go on one of these hunts
imagine if coryxkenshin came on here that would be so epic
Loved seeing Rae and Leslie on the channel!!!
Sam and Colby you guys are so cool and mor if i can say please don't let haters let you not post and colby i am so happy you have passed canner and sam you are the best and i have been your fan for a long time and i am happy for when you guys post and thank you for making my day every day happy new year!!!!😁😁❤❤😁😁❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊

What if Lou was drunk
Did literally know one see the two glowing eyes at 37:57 in the corner of the room….. I literally can’t see any comment talking about it 😂🤣
Sam & Colby you guys should do an investigation with The Boys in their YouTube videos of going to haunted places, they mention that if u guys were watching their video to do an investigation with them so could you do an investigation with the boys I kinda wanna really see what would happen if u did if u could please do it, and if you do thank you

you guys should bring Amanda next i love her !

I live really close to this place and have heard a lot of stories about it. Alton is just one of those small towns that have a lot of history and cool things behind it so it was so cool to see you guys do a place that i already know so much about
Sam and Colby you should explore an abandoned junkyard
We need an investigation with JC Caylen!!! He’s such a baby it would be so funny
Yo, you should Collab with the boys
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening out of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may everyone you the upmost respect.

@thetryguys should come try ghost hunting lol
Omg the movie comes tomorrow
i played Pokemon go in a cemetery
You guys have got to invite Markiplier to go with u. Literally would die to see that.
A cool spot y’all could go to is a place called the Demon house. They had to cover the windows because the entity’s in the house were stalking them and it caused many problems. Sounded interesting and though it would be cool ❤
16:00 does anyone think that shadow was a ghost or them? Cuz I saw it clear as day
Y’all should do a video with Ranboo and Tubbo
Sam and Colby if you see this please read all of it because it's part of my story of being a 10/10 believer ok so im 11 and when i was really young I loved ghost movies really ghost anything and this 1 time I got a TV with only three Lullabies and I was really happy when I got it and 3 months later it stopped working and I kept it 2 weeks later at night it starts playing and I was really scared and I broke it with a hammer and I fell asleep after 10 minutes and I woke up to it playing so me and my mom threw it away so and when I was like 7 or 8 I was playing at my grandma's house and it was 2 days after my brother's birthday and he got a toy that was of batman and it was big but it played all by itself so we put it outside and it would walk outside in my grandma's backyard it wasn't supposed to walk or move and then we put it in the trash and never saw it again and just in 2022 I was in my mom's ex boyfriends and I was playing in my room because my mom was still dating him then and I heard a little girl whisper in my ear and it sounded like she said "hi" and I was all alone and I was scared and when I was 6 I was had a pen thrown at me when i was in my basement and I was playing and I was alone with my mom upstairs and the pen was in the other room and it got thrown at me I was not very hurt but still was hurt and when I was 9 my baby cousin was on the stairs and me my uncle my mom and my grandma were in the kitchen which is next to the stairs and my baby cousin was like 2 or 3 and while she was on the stairs she talked to like 3 ghost because she said hi 3 times and she was like playing with them and all of us were very scared edit: now im watching all of you and i used to watch you guys and i still do but ive believed forever so bye but happy 2024 i hope to see more <3 ❤

Hi, just wanted to say you guys are great and I love you guys not in a weird way and you guys are my idols and I really want to meet you in person and maybe become friends one day and you guys are great and I don't like the people who hate on you they're just mean and the reason why I say idols is because I've watched you guys since I was only seven and I'm going to be 13 next year so you're amazing and great and also my bestie wanted to say that she loves you guys too also not in a weird way and I just really hope you can reply to me soon and I'll probably DM you guys eventually so love you guys😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤
Now I that you have met Tommyinnit, Jackmanifold, Nikki Nihaachuu, AND Valkyrae I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME WAY TO CONTACT RANBOO AND BRING THEM SOMEWHERE!!!!!!
Idk if y'all have done tranquille Canada but u should look it up if u haven't.
This is why I probably would not go to a place that’s haunted unless it’s with professionals because Ola sounds a lot like Lola, which is my name and the thing is the name is Lady and blue and my favorite color is blue and I always wear it and the thing is, this is whyand majority of the time that has to do with like a haunted story always has to deal with a girl named Lola has to deal with the name Lola it always has to put the meaning behind. Lola is sorrows, which is sad and that’s why majority of the time it has to do with the color blue because blue represents sadness. It’s scary.
You guys should totally go to skinwalker ranch
As far as I’m aware Binaural Beats don’t really put you in a trance, they open your energy to align with whatever you’re looking for in this case communicating with spirits. I would love to see them use crystals more maybe it would be easier for them to communicate using black onyx crystals. They’re known to absorb negative energy so in a way the spirits are pulled towards them.
Like this comment if you didint come from tik tock
Hey guys, I would really like to see y'all with the twin paranormal and destination fear crew, now not being lame, or anything, but I can't recall the name of the movie but weren't Sam and Colby in a movie, it's been a while, and I think it was like Goosebumps or something like that?
James bond
You guys should make a video with Peet Montzingo!
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY COLBY❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I would want to see @dytto
People who watched this video on the 5th
I wish I could go!!! I’d love to
It seems like in almost every exploration video it’s always a woman that feel ill or sick. It might just be me but remember when Celina got sick almost right after you explored that other place?(i forgot which one) and now Valkyrae feels feeling sick too! Again, it’s just a theory but MAYBE there’s something in the difference of female DNA and male DNA that causes woman to feel more sick in the presence of spirits. :D
Sam and Colby, Butte Montana is know for being pretty haunted and for the mining that happened here in the early 1900 on June 13 1917 a fire broke out in the mines and killed 168 miners and there said to haunt butte now butte has a really dark past

Hey Sam & Colby! I was wondering if you have ever heard of the Hotel Andra in Seattle. It is haunted by multiple ghosts and i think it would make a really cool video. When I was 2, I stayed there and had the most unforgettable paranormal experience i've ever had (and i see ghosts all the time). I was going to go to bed, but i didn't feel tired so my mom let me get some energy out and play on the floor. I looked into the doorframe, and saw a woman standing there, at first i thought it was just my shadow, but then i moved around and it didn't move with me. I turned to my mom and said "Mama theres a lady in the door!". My mom froze. she says that she saw me see her. It looked like the shadow of a woman wearing a dress from the late 1800s - 1930s. Ive had other paranormal experiences, but this one is the most memorable.
U need to collab woth the boys pls
when you got to pear's room my friend had a sharp back pain, and he has never felt like that befor in his life time.
YOU SHOULD MAKE A VIDEO WITH ITFUNNEH AND KREW BC I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MY TOP 2 FAVOURITE YOUTUBERS COLLABORATING TOGETHER
No offense
When i heard the cop car i said sam and colby make sure your not tresspassing we cant have history repeat its self😂😂😂
Can Sam and Colby reply to this comment it would mean a lot to me 😢
I want you sam and colby to take SLOGOMAN (JOSH) PLZ PLZ
anyone saw a light of orb in the dark..? During the haunted pool clip?
You should definitely do a collab with *The Boys* since they’ve been wanting to collab with you guys for a while.. 😭 They’ve brought you up a couple of times before in their haunted videos where they went to haunted places and I love watching The Boys Channel and all their other channels as much as I love watching your videos so it would be make me so happy to see both channels collab!! :3
Well there was a light collaboration with the Boys in their reaction to the conjuring series maybe hit them up. Just purely on the fact that both channels went to the conjuring house and where able to compare what happened to each other. Despite the Boys be pranksters the last few ghost vids they did had me on the edge of Mt seat much like Sam and Colby. Also good hunting guys keep up the awesome content
These 2 girls made it super boring
Yooo I live in Illinois yall gotta do a meet up here sometime
Nobody Colby taking a shot “oh sh*t”
We wanna see Wilbur again!! Maybe the whole band (LoveJoy) could come this time!!
@Samandcolby random shadow figure at 16:00
I feel like there was too many plugs or ads throughout the video, also interrupting sometimes. I don't know if that's something you usually do in your video, but it was slightly annoying and took me out of the immersion :(
You should collab with the sturniolo triplets
BRING TANA AND IMARI ON
@nickeh30
this is acc one of the first vids where i can acc hear all the noises they say to listen for
Yo you guys should go back to the built more hotel like I would love to see you guys go back there
most american think is saying hello while hearing a random ass noise or seeing smt
Cool video I love sam and colby there awesome I wish I had friends like them and I'm having a bad day  .sorry for venting .
Bro every time when I’m bored I watch u and I get the goose bumps but y’all still entertain me
Take DanTDM with you pls
Bring kris and celina to the conjuring house
These girls are pretty annoying 😐Celina and Kris are the best duo tho
not sam going back to his 3am challenge roots with all the rituals recently XD
Should totally do a video with @mindseed
I just realized that if you have cancer then does that have a connection with that one doll that if you look at it’s eyes for to long then something bad happens.
I bet ya'll are a blast to hunt with. Just watching the 2023 year has been awesome!
Gotta get mr. Beast in a video @mrbeast
Yall should do a collab with Twin Paranormal
Bro my best friend lives or lived here!!!!
Eddie vr should go with Sam and Colby
Hey Sam and Colby, have you already seen that horror movie about the queen mary?
Mark
now the video of Leslie loving Lu makes sense
People who realized the first transition was Colby's area😂
Can you go to the sallie House again just with kris and celinaspookyboo thank you for your vids
I love ur scary videos
You should invite Eddie (eddieVR or Special edd). He has done this before with his friends but it would be a cool collab.
I have an idea of where you should go  You should go to the McBeth House Centre and Park Trail
Man the editing in this video is great!
As much as I enjoy the guests you bring onto your videos, I can help but miss just Sam and Colby. Just two friends hanging out and talking to demons
why is every other comment about "not allowing negative energy or spirits"? Do you guys think the spirits are watching you through youtube/your screen? lol
16:00 That shadow in the window scared the crap out of me
you and the boys should collab
I thought you guys wanted to focus on becoming better paranormal investigators and explore Colbys possible psychic abilities, instead its become let's bring random content creators on and scare them. Starting to feel more like a prank show. I miss Nate and Josh and Amanda and the Haunted Nights guys. People who actually care and take paranormal investigation seriously. I don't mind having humor to break tension but when it overwhelms the video nothing is actually suspenseful and it all feels like a joke. I love you guys and your videos, but right now you've got a major tone problem. If you want to keep bringing random guests and goofing around thats your choice, but can you stop promising us better and more serious investigating if you don't really mean it.
@sturniolo Triplets
I’m 100% ready I’d love to go to a haunted location with you guys
Isn't Michael the man from crescent hotel the one with kris and celina
Y’all needa to take me wit y’all
12:35 God sent a Guardian Angel to smack him to the wall to stop him from going into chaos 🤣 Sometimes things that happen that upset you in life happen to strengthen you, teach you, or prevent something worse from happening. God loves all ⛅

Leslie and sam freaking out together during the estes method was my favourite part. I get so stressed out during the videos (in good way like im anxious to see more) but youre always reminded that theyre just normal people having fun too
You should do a vid with 13-16 year olds! I would love to see their reactions and that adventure would be amazing! I know I would love it. I love your guy's channel and have watched every single video like 5 times. You've come so far since you first started! Thanks for posting and always making my day.
I watched night swim today
Yall should do a collab with: @lantescarylives He does alot of the same stuff yall do!!!!!!
yo, i want to go there
i’ve had my own experience at mineral springs when my young niece pointed into an empty dining room and asked what “that person” was doing in there… needless to say, there was not a person in sight. so amazing to see you guys so close to my home, and to see you guys visiting my favorite shop around! you guys showed me parts of this place i’ve never seen before—can’t explain how grateful i am! thank you guys for a great 2023! can’t wait for 2024!
This is why I love sam and colby they are positive and energetic!!

i’m pretty sure colby turned around tho😭
I love you guys I want to meet you guys so bad
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii my name is kaylee
I love you guys
Hiiiiiiiiiiii
it may have gotten angry because when colby was talking to cassie ( 41:42 ) he slightly turned over his shoulder instead of his whole body, or they did the matches wrong.
I love you guys so much you saved me from a really dark place with your laughs and smiles my favorite video was the crescent hotel as it was so funny but I've been here since the beginning love you guys
This video was actually so interesting and hilarious at the same time, they’re so funny lol
Is it just me or does the guide Dave look like Jeff Goldblum from Jurassic World in certain angles? 😭
At the hosting game, i almost shit my pants. I honestly thought it was on me too😭😭
0:36
41:52 does this count as turning around???
I wish I could go ghost hunting w u😭😭
Sam and colby you guys are amezing  and i think you should bring special edd to one of your videos
Is it just me or did colby look around his shoulder when the other camera vision was on screen?? Time is 41:53
were those eyes in the door on right around 37:55
if i was stuck as a ghost i would also spend my time messing with people

Happy late birthday Colby 🎉
I’m pregnant your the father
Kashmiri tall black ghost lives here .what is he doing all the way here from Kashmir
Take IshowSpeed 👹
Who else check comment before watching 😄
Absolutely in love with your channel and videos hope you so much love and happiness in 2024❤
Colby can you do the kidnapping prank on Sam or we He. You fall down the stairs
hi sam and colby, i love yalls vids
I feel like Sam and Colby doing a collab with Brittney Broski would be HILARIOUS!
u should take kris and sahar and maybe spenser  plzz i love them
I'd say you blew the match ritual.   It MUST light the first time you strike it, if the ritual is going to work at all in the first place, which I doubt.   Next time, try this: 3 three inch diameter candles (White - NEVER Black).    Place one 3 feet from the entrance (centered) - place the other two 3 feet back at an angle 3 feet apart, forming a triangle.    Light them, step back 9 feet from the center of the back two and wait.    Maybe nothing will happen, maybe it will; you will have to try it and see... or don't - up to you.
16:00  no way there was someone in the window
I saw the tiktok from spencer and y’all met him and tbh i’m waiting for the video with spencer😊😊
@makeupbypita should collab with you lol
Yall forgot but I didn't so do the truth or strip or drink idk
Guess what i want to the soomthing house😊 i sub and like your Videos
I would love to see Tommyinnit and Wilbur do one together they’ll make it…let’s say interesting😂
lamooo at first the gurls were so into it
Colby looks behind him self at 41:48
my wife did so well :) <3
Sam and Colby, if you're ever in Illinois again, I highly recommend checking out the Old Joliet Prison in Joliet, Illinois. Tons of cool history and would make for a great episode and would be awesome to EXPLORE! It is a big area to cover and lots of potential to capture great evidence. Claimed to be one of the most haunted places in the world. It has also housed murderers such as John Wayne Gacy and other infamous people. It has been the set for the hit T.V. show "Prison Break". I believe all of us Sam and Colby fans would really enjoy seeing you guys take it on! Thanks for all the awesome content guys!
So for Christmas I got a $50.00 gift card to Zumiez because I ride skateboards and you guys said that you had merch there and I flipped out we went there the next day and bought your shirt that says currently fighting demons shirt and I’m going to see night swim this Sunday and I’m wearing that shirt!!!!!!! Love you guys so much and you guys make me feel loved!
gurl colby needs a hair cut loll. not being rude just saying lol
Not me just finding out that they went to a town an hour away from me…🤣 I’m so clueless all the time istg
I have watched shows that are just Sam or just Colby.    I have to say: Colby without Sam is like Pizza without ANY cheese what-so-ever.   Or, a PB&J without the PB.    Of course the same could be said for Sam without Colby also.    So... Stay together guys because you are both better when together.    A MUCH MORE enjoyable watch.   I'm not saying you should stop doing individual stuff, but I am saying you should do most things together.    What is cereal without milk?   What is a forest without trees?   What is a lake without water?   Just better with both.
You two should collaborate with jacksepticeye and danTDM
Did anyone else see the pair of eyes as they were walking to the pool during the hosting ritual?
They made this 4 days ago and they said that they are in November rn??
at this pointt I have been wanting to go to hunted places but I don't have the stuff you guys make me want to do this
@caseoh I beg you come on
Im watching this video late crying, bc i know that explore merch gonna be sold out at my local zumiez.
It must take so long for them to edit their videos if they filmed it in November and it was posted end of December
Who thinks Colby is so hot but knows we're  never get a chance 😭
PLEASE TAKE NESSA BARRETT, she watches you guys and i think she'll love it and be such a good watch!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!!!!  (Sorry if I am a day late)
Sam and Colby you need to go to wendigo forest. Atleast that’s what I think it’s called
Did anyone else see the figure stand up and run off at 16:05 behind the window covering?
I live 30 to 40 minutes away from Alton
HOLY SHIT YOU GUYS WERE SO CLOSE TO WHERE I LIVE
You guys should totally do one with Jaiden animations
Do you guys have any plans to bring an actual witch or spirit worker along eventually? I enjoy when Amanda comes on because she’s the closest to that, but seeing as she is more Christian based, I wonder what a witch or a spirit worker could do or teach you guys to make your investigations more in-depth and interesting.   Basically, this view-baiting celebrity ghost hunting show isn’t why I enjoyed your content. I enjoyed it because you guys were exploring what could be the afterlife. Now you guys are just seem like a party trick for celebrities. I don’t mean to be rude or insulting, but your ghost hunting doesn’t feel authentic as it used to anymore. I thought it was just a little thing you were doing because the celebrities wanted to do it, but now it seems like you’re just tour guides for the celebrities now.   I hope you guys are enjoying yourself and if not I hope you can find a way to enjoy yourselves again. I love you too and will always be a fan. I just wanted to express that I didn’t expect your channel to go in this direction.
Happy birthday Colby!!🎉
The boys]
sam and colby: we should split up val and les: i no no wanna
around 55:43 i think i heard a breath or something similar right when (sorry idk her name) is saying chills? or is it just me hearing it?
Me, my family, friends and loved ones DO NOT CLAIM any negative energy or spirits from this video: on behalf of everyone I am extremely sorry for watching this video without permission and thank you for letting us know the backstory
Am I the only one who didn’t enjoy this episode?  Maybe it’s due to my lack of patience lately.  Sorry don’t mean to be rude 😅  but God they were so fucking squeaky and annoying to me.
Low key I just wanna know what the banger of a song they played at the end there is called please 1:08:39
Bro colby tipsy is funny 😭😭😭
Love Sam and Colby and all that you do, literally binged all your videos. But there’s nothing like the videos of just sam and Colby or the main guys all together. I can’t get into videos with all the random girls or people in them. They’re so hard to listen to and focus on the point of the video. If you can do more videos without random people!!! Anyone else agree?!! 🙏🏻 Respectfully.
It's so cool y'all were in my state only 2 hours away from me! You should definitely check out Ashmore Estates in Illinois sometime. It has a pretty dark history too
Hope you make it out alive😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Do Markiplier
its so crazy how you can hear the people talk in the hotel and so clear like ?!
I was a day late but happy birthday Jan 2 Colby 💅
hold up, your supposed to take jack Daniels in shots?
@markiplier should do one these with you guys
imagine getting chased down by a ghost trex
At like 21 minutes right before the real investigations started, I noticed what I think was just a huge ass raccoon or cat scurry across the outside of a window it scared me so bad🤣🤣
Bring Kris and Celina plzzzzzzz❤
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY YOUR BDAY WAS YESTERDAYYYYY!
Exactly why I don't fuck wit this shit dawg
Is it just me or did no one realise after they did the party Didn’t turn around for the rest of the video
Can I add me back
Can u bring Lexi Rivera or Pierson on a trip to a haunted place! I love your videos snd would rlly like to see my two favorite YouTubers go on an adventure!!!
I would love to jacksepticeye in one of these videos I feel like he would be hilarious to watch😂
Look at 15:55 and look at the middle window. Did a shadow fly by??
Sam and Colby do a Caleb with the boys
you guys should have LoeyLane join in one of your 2024 vids!
Okay but with the whole ritual they used while they were in the pool: the name they received was michael, who told the story the guide told, and the spirit in said story was described as a "guardian angel". This sounds a lot like the spirit talking to them was the same spirit as the one in the story the guide told, and may be an angel "Michael" as the guide suggested
You should totally check out Emily’s bridge in Vermont basically it’s about a girl who was very rich and she fell in love with a poor man and her father wouldn’t allow the relationship so he had him killed. So because of this Emily went to the bridge and hung herself on it. Now when people visit the bridge the men that are with them report being scratched or hurt in anyway. This being from Emily’s hatred for men and Emily apparently doesn’t hate women she only dislikes men. You can see in the background of pictures orbs as well as full figures.
Wow! Universal studio's? Good job guys
you shoud try to do a collab with The Boys. I think that would be an exciting video.
You should explore the brown hotel and the seelbach
I think you guys should bring dream and george to a haunted place
Sometime I might be going to Sallie house for a video

I think that they should make a video with one of the more famous youtubers, like Jacksepticeye or Markiplier
My Family is from Alton IL.

Leslie was so much fun!!! Please have her back again, of course if she is comfortable and willing❤

Im a true believer in god… but I always asked if u can ask if god was real and get some answers because why is there heaven, hell, and afterlife on earth… it does not make any sense to me
The video just started and already Leslie and Rae are my favorite guests 😂
You guys have new girlfriends?😊
Bro the guide got rizzed up by the ghost and proceeded to yell slurs at it💀

I am homeless and I sleep in the woods in my tent every night and watching this is a little scary but your silliness definitely helps ease that so thank you ❤
You guys gotta learn how to light matches haha. Always hold your finger towards the tip as you slide it along. lol

No face, black straight hair. its on the overnight challange with kian on the queen mary. I hope they see this because i doubt anyone is gonna like this. Its been 4 years and they still havent noticed.
I wish you guys could record the Estes method sessions (what the headphones are saying) so i can compare what I hear. I can never understand what those spirit boxes are saying.

I loved this and its my b day on January 7th
sam and colby should lowkey take the sturniolos or baylen levine and seabass with them
Honestly, Sam is every white person in a horror movie.😂
you should take kris and celina to the conjuring house and do the midnight man game there
It seems like a streamer's rite of passage now to do an investigation with "the boys."   Also just a small suggestion!! Sometimes it's harder to hear the subtler or more indistinct noises when there's music and sound effects because I can't tell the sound effects apart from the noises. Don't get me wrong, the sound production is amazing in these videos and is great when there aren't any noises happening, it would be just nice if there was no extra noise during those moments.  Also... that ending was CRAZY. It seems like at the beginning, the husband was just speaking through Colby and the wife was attempting to speak through Valkyrae but wasn't communicating very clearly, combined with the fact Valkyrae hasn't ever done the Estes method before so needed a bit to get used to it whereas Colby is very used to discerning words through the noise. I've done the Estes method before and it took me a while to find the groove, and once you do it takes an almost meditative amount of concentration. Then they seemingly swapped because Colby could hear her more clearly, and I think the husband's loud and domineering presence was much easier for Valkyrae to hear and discern among the noise. But then they seemingly both went to Colby, and then it was almost like the husband took over both of their radios, with the wife fighting to get a word in whenever she could.
It’s called forest haven
You guys should check out a abandoned asylum in laurel, maryland
Where may I send you a clip of a video of a guy in a haunted house  returning to close a ouija session because last one he ran out of the house because of a demon girl appearing so it was left open I can send you both videos so you can see them both second video shows demon little girl
More Celina and Kris content
Also try to get two of my fav (Other than y'all) youtubers, Eddie and Narrator to go ghost hunting with y'all, they went to the Clown Motel, but never where you guys have been
you an kris an celina at the cecil hotel is what i wanna see
I am now in love with Colby for he is the first YouTuber I have ever heard call a mouse adorable which is honestly so 100% true      P.S. I have 2 pet mice...
Bro i can't belive it this was one year ago 😢😢😢 but im scared of those pictures that they put and they leave me without sleep for days
U guys should take ishowspeed with u on ur next adventure
i do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening our side of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may have everyone give you the upmost respect! May you rest in peace.
Those were the most clear answers and convos between 2 spirits on that dual Estes Method man, spooky stuff. Love the vids Sam & Colby!
Colby looked behind him when he held the little talk box in the pool.
They should take the boys it would be funny
HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY COLBYYYYYYYYYY <333333

You should do a vid with bushwhack18. I think it would be a great vid😁
For the Germans February 8th is the date of night swim for the theaters 29:24
I NEED YOU GUYS TO WRITE ANOTHER BOOK
@sturniolo triplets
that was the *craziest* dual Estes I've ever seen! Poor Pearl. I hope she gets to move on someday. <3
I think it should be me and my cousin because me and him both love you guys and you guys inspired me to do paranormal stuff. So please do me and my cousin
I totally looove your content! But you guys curse so much! Thanks for sharing your videos!  🙋🏼‍♀️🙏🏼
My world colliding makes me so excited
sam is the beautifullest women
Right after I watch you guys, I hear stuff coming from outside, sometimes from the kitchen, but it sounds like my dog, but he wasn't awake, when I checked the time, that's when I realized it was 3AM, I swear, I would hear it from 3 to 4AM, I'm terrified, because I keep seeing shadows to, and hear voices when I'm home alone, this is terrifying, I was also pushed when I was home alone, going to get something to sleep, I felt someone push me, and once at 5th grade camp, when I was playing hide and seek in the dark, I felt someone was right next to me, but I was in a cabinet, that wasn't my first paranormal encounter though, my first was when I was 6, i had woken up one night, when i checked the time it was 3AM, that's when I noticed I couldn't move my torso, and when I went to go to the bathroom, a tall figure was staring at me from the hallway, when stared at each other for only a minute, and he disappeared when I had blinked, I was terrified, and never saw him since
Yeahssssssssssssssssss I wish they would go w/ itsfunneh and her siblings lol 👁️👄👁️
Sam and Colby my house is haunted what’s a good method to talk to the spirits bcz I’ve encountered a lot of paranormal activity
Yall should do a colab with @Kelsi Davies
Ngl Sam and Colby should do a duet with sssniperwolf she has played some haunted game
Please bring Markiplier ghost hunting that would be so fun
You should do Louie’s life and Adam!!!😝

Seeing how far the boys have come over the years of their exploring and investigating- I'm really happy that they've picked up the habit of cleansing after these experiences to keep themselves and those who go with them safe from any negative energy or attachments

For the flashlights, would it still have the same effect if someone would hold it in their hands?
I TOTALLY THINK THAT KUB SCOUTS WOULD LOVE AND HATE THIS SO MUCH

New drinking game unlocked
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening our side of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may have everyone give you the upmost respect! May you rest in peace.
Sam and Colby please go back to the conjuring house that was the best thing I’ve ever seen
Do yall do lives if so how often
Being sponsored by universal studios is insane
I know only colby reamaked the old grind on me but I want sam and colby to remake it😢😢😢
At 42:14, I reached over my phone to move it while watching the bracelet I had on my wrist. When the word "bracelet" came up on the ovulus, it freaked me out lmao. (I was given this bracelet today)
Is it just me who noticed that when they were doing the pool ritual Colby looked behind him which as they said there not allowed to do. I really hope he’s okay and nothing bad happens to him now
I REMEMBER SAM DOING THIS ON HIS CHANNEL A COUPLE YEARS AGO
Kris and Celina are required monthly in 2024!!❤❤❤
i rarely feel scared watching ghost hahnting but because rae and leslie were actually scared and freaking out it actually makes me feel scared lol
Hopefully you don’t bring back Cody and Satori in 2024 😂 but damn did it get you a lot of views, eh?❤❤
Guys you are amazing, take Celena and Kris to more adventures of yours! 😁
id wanna see Jollz go explore with yall tbh
Alton native here and i can comfirm its haunted as shit  To bad they didnt go to the milton school or the mcpike mansion or the alton gravy yard or the love joy monument shit just going into one of the houses on bell street would give you all kinds of crazy stuff

7:53 so cute how they always immediately check on the people there with❤
I would love to come to a haunted place with y'all
Is it just me or do Sam and Colby look sad or not okay in some parts like they look different to me
Bro Sam and Colby taught me not to be scared of ghosts😂😂😂
Was there something at 16 minutes or was that just one of their shadows?
Happy late birthday Colby!🎉
I am a big fan of you guys video because I like scary stuff.
Can yall get MrBallen to come do a video with you guys?
Clicking on this video with zero context of what its about and seeing that you're in my hometown lol 😮
I’m not sure if this has been brought to your attention but there is someone trying to “debunk” your videos. Specifically pt.3 of the week at conjuring house. He really isn’t even debunking anything, he’s just attacking you guys and your fans. He claims that you guys are complete fakes and your producers and editors add in extra sounds. His YouTube is “beardo gets scared”. In the video he points out that you can see something peaking up from the basement, beardo says that it’s one of your producers down there.
You guys should try ghost hunting with Kelsie Davies (Idk how to spell her name)
if you get 20 mil subs can you go to the conjuring house for 3 weeks
41:44 Colby!! You just turned around 😂😂
Please do jschlatt and philza
always enjoy watching you guys and hope to one day join you on a video i would gladly spend the night alone in a haunted room for you guys
we love youuussssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss❤
Sam Colby when the guide was talking about the husband when you turned your camera towards Leslie the window behind her it was a shadow running past
Late birthday wishes Colby I hope you had a great birthday 🥳🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉
You guys should film with @TwinParanormal 😇🙏🏼
Sam and Colby should come to Ohio there's a lot of woods that have some wierd story's here and in cuyahoga falls  we have a river and there's a lot of shit that goes down
Happy birthday sorry it is a bit late
i dont claim any negative energy from this video and i do not allow anything to come around me or my loved ones while i watch this series. Sorry for any glances i made, i dont mean any disrespect. thank you for listening to our stories
Damnit they were in my city and i didnt get to meet them
Bro 1 white girl as a connecter infront of 5 big black shadow figures
Sam and Colby and the boys please make a colab it will be insane!
Michael is my name bro I was like wtf
48:37 the music makes everything funnier 😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ok just wait a second. Do you think the Henry from the poolroom was from the conjuring house and he followed you from episode one?
Wait idk if they mention it bc I’m not done with the video, but didn’t it say Michael in the pool? During the party bit and now in the basement thing they’re talking about a Michael
I cant believe that yall were in my state 😭😭😭
I am raegann and I want to do it
I am Ur biggest fan I really want to meet U guys but I don't know where U live

Me and my sister for the very first time got your merch 😭♥️ we been wanting for years to buy your merch and it just arrived today and we were screaming the house down of joy 😭 that's one thing ticked off our bucket list
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBYYYYY 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bro at 22:12 a spirt or ghost or whatever ran by.   I do not allow any evil spirits near me. Or around my family members. I am truly sorry for any glasses that I should not have made. I am sorry and thank you for letting me hear Your Story. Rest in peace.
I don't claim any negative energy from these videos. They are not allowed in my home. Also, these two girls were obnoxious and i had to fast forward through most of the video. Only Sam and Colby were funny in this video guys..... i felt like most time was wasted on this one. Their 7 minutes in the basement,  they didn't even notice the rock next to pillar lifting up and getting thrown at 56:03 🤦‍♀️ flashlights trying to communicate and the kids didnt take advantage of it 😂🤷‍♀️
22:13 a black figure runs behind them
Omg blau and ellum in this would be hilarious
you were in my state and didn’t tell me!?! 😭
@minibloxia
You guys have to bring them back especially Les! She's so fun to watch Hahaha
Bro you look just like collins and deven key
Sam and Colby are now doing couples therapy now
I’d love to see @ryantrahan and @airrack go on a ghost hunt that would be hallarious or @steveo that would be crazy !!!!!!! You literally go viral 😂
please collaborate with jackceptcey and James Charles
It could have been a sentence that you just needed to piece together? “Carol’s cousin only kept Harry” ??
THE EYES IN THE 2ND DOOR WHEN THEY WALK INTO THE POOL HAS ANYONE NOT NOTICED? 37:56
You Guys Made me watch paranormal stuff, im a believer because i casually hear knocking or creaking sounds at night as a routine, i never thought about it till now
Next time go to a place that is haunted but also filled with active spirits
When cobly said "son of a b----" and rae said "idiot" I burst out laughing for some reason it was funny I was sitting down for 10 minutes laughing so hard
Why does the guide look like my history teacher
Awe shit, you filmed this on my birthday. I remember exactly where I was during 12am. Plastered at a house party. Lou would be proud
16:00 Look at the window behind the the girl when the Sam turns the camera, It looks like a shadow behind the window 😟
One time I would love to see these guys do ghost hunting with subscribers that would be fun to watch
eyy my night routine is watching you guys
So idk if this is like a coincidence or it has some meaning i don’t know about but always when i watch or even hear sam&colby i get a headache andwhen they mention and use the estes method my eyes are watering (i never have that)
Guess who's back? Back again
Would you ever bring your subscribers out on a ghost adventure with you? That’s something that I personally would be so extremely interested in and I’m sure I’m not the only one!!   Also you should bring mark because he’s a huge horror game player!
Sam is so attractive
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening to our side of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may have everyone give you the upmost respect! May you rest in peace
51:56  Sam: AWHSBFJLASOIEWFJL
You should go ghost hunting with Caseoh in Arkansas
Subscribe if u support palestine ❤
Tbh sam and colby needs to do a haunted video with ishowspeed or coryxkenshin it would be so funny and scary

You guys should really try to come to South Africa🙏
I don't claim any negative energy from this video . I do not allow any negative energy to come around me or follow me . I apologise if i made any glances i shouldn't have . I respect you and may you rest in peace  ❤
Pure content, not scary  and too much ads.  Unsubscribe 😢
@cardi b
Uhh guys anybody else see the two eyes at 37:58
I claim no negative energy watching this vid
I swear they make every video funny😂
59:09 so we’re gonna ignore that there was someone in the middle chair?? i got full body chills
My Friend who is in love with you guys can't see this video for her the last video was the investigating best friends house and I don't know how that can happen I tried sharing the video but it still said she can't see it 🤷‍♀️
Happy birthday to you colby ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤

31:25
You should do a video with amber!!!
I'm a Muslim and I believe that they are being messed with by jinns which are non human entities good and bad like the conjuring. They cannot hurt and affect you in any way if you read a certain surah. this is just my religion don't attack me in the comments😊 also take mrwhosetheboss please
Make a video with the boys

Happy Birthday Colby ❤
i NEED to see them and life of luxury do a video
If y’all are scared why do you always do it during night?
Caseoh said he was willing to go on a ghost hunt and I told him about y’all he’s a famous twitch streamer
That match game gave me 3am videos all over again!!
🤤🤤🤤
When she said he stole it maybe she was talking about the ring

SURLY THERE WILL BE A PART 2 I WANNA KNOW MORE PS I LOVE YOU GUYS❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

37:57. I am not sure if its something reflecting or not. But i see glowing eyes in the right of the screen in the dark

Hey guys you should try and get twin paranormal to come on as guest. They also do some amazing ghost hunting.
Keep up the great work boys you’re doing amazing 😁❤️

This year was amazing 🎉 I wish you a happy new year 🎉 ❤
Happy birthday day Colby
in your other channel you said you were going to go to the Warren's museum if the video got a 100 thousand likes and it did,so what now?
Hey Sam and Colby I love your work and it’s helping me to get through the darkest time of my life. So I just wanted to thank you for everything that you’ve done.
39:56 look at the ceiling
Lol, John Wayne Casey was a serial killer that killed I believe the body count is in the high 30's he lured boys to his house then killed them then proceeded to bury them under his house after killing them, it's so hard to believe nobody smelled the bodies before J.W.C was apprehended. Much love and light guys I still can't get over the house you got direct confirmation from spirits, but it's all most some rule that spirits cannot tell us about the after life completely IDN just a thought.. much love and light kiddo's
Hey Sam and Colby I love your work and it’s helping me to get through the darkest time of my life. So I just wanted to thank you for everything that you’ve done.
at 16:08 was it just me or did i see something walk past the plastic cover in the window
Kris and Celina are the best duo
Why is it that you guys kinda can’t top the conjuring season even the Cody and satori lied I still love you guys soo much but could you do more dark ones?
I didn’t know you guys were in here 🥺         👉    👈
take James Charles with u for a ghost hunt lol
I am I the only who saw something run TWICE behind Leslie and Rae at 22:13 (if you play on from there ) and 22:18  (if u play on ) but they look a bit like cars idk
I show speed is my recommend to have a funny and a wonderful ghost hunt for yall !! <3
Alton Illinois is my home town, it’s a very historical and haunted city. There are endless stories about the place, I hope you guys get the chance to make more content about Alton.
26:21" my vibrators off." BRO WTF WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT?!?!
IT'S JANUARY 3RD RN BUT I JS WANNA SAY HAPPY B'DAY I MISSED IT YESTERDAY SO I'M SAYING IT NOW HAPPY B'DAY 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  (His b'day is on Jan 2nd)  Edit: I js realized Colby is 13yrs older then me and Sam is 14yrs older I think-
hands down one of my favourite videos of all time
OR DO A KRIS AND CELINA ONE AGAIN
YOU GUYS SHOULD TAKE OUT LAURENZSIDE
Holy shit I wasn’t even there but when u said “were you there at our party” and Rae said “u better believe it” chills run all the way up my body!  This stuff is insaneeeeeee
Lmao yall are such dummys makes for the best content. The confidence Colby said Mickey was 10/10 😂😂 51:29
01:08:06 STOP GIVING SAM IDEAS!! Lol but seriously, who can just SEE a cut frame to Colby being hung upside down by his ankles to a rafter in some haunted barn or asylum LMAO poor guy!!
But they really need a haircut 💇‍♂️
I was just kidding about how funny they look 😊😊😊
Coby also needs a haircut look at his hair on his face  they look so funny 😂
Sam needs a haircut 😂 his hair looks so fluffy and funny
I think y’all should take Lia Aka Sssniperwolf.It’ll be so cool ✨
so many simple minded people in here, is this really how many!, well lets say? ♿have a few cans short of a dozen📴
Sam saying hello to ghost😂
I feel like sam and colby could go to not so well known places where people claim are haunted and test if they are
31:37 😭😭
@corpsehusband would be my choice for a person to do a visit with you guys, but I know it might not be easy for him. I think his personality would be awesome
You know you are famous when you are sponcered by universal pictures
Kinda missing the Horror vibe we had from Sam & Colby. (Witches Forest, Origin etc.) 😩
Ngl I would really really love to see coryxkension go ghost hunting with you guys he's such a great YouTuber and an amazing person
16:00 was that a shadow on the video!!!!!
You guys should team up with omargosh
you guys should get Tubbo_ on cause i heard he's not much of a believer on one of his streams.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY WE LOVE U And hope u have a awesome birthday ❤❤❤
i claim no negative energy from this video
IM RUNNING TO ZUMIEZ WTF BYE IM GONE AND GOING BROKE
56:30 ok @sturniolotriplets
Leslie was so happy every time she talked about pushing Rae in the pool LOL😂
45:07 Micheal who do you remember being called Micheal?    The crescent hotel?    What if Micheal has followed you guys from the crescent hotel and just stood on the sidelines or he's following Kris and came to see what you were doing for this investigation.     Have a look in the mineral Springs Hotel registration files to see if there was a Micheal who died there. And if there isn't then this case is solved...    Micheal is supposed to be the shadow figure and what did Kris see at the crescent hotel?     A shadow figure called micheal 😅.
So tired of the random tiktokers tagging along the ghost adventures. All these videos are is of ya'll talking. No ghost action. Annoying & boring. I miss the old Sam & colby 😢
Where can I get the headphones so I can hear the ghost
there gonna be wasted...... this sh*t is funny..... watch as a spirit scared them, cause there wasted...... CHEERS!
Omg I love this vid but u guys have to go back to the goat mans bridge cus Celina couldn't go cus she got sick and that broke me heart and I would love to see this comment in the vid if u do go love y'all ❤️❤️ and all u do for us thank u love u guys
41:52 bro looked behind him gosh darn Colby
i know how it is there bc i hava been there i was sad and alot of pain
22:13 Some shadow of something passed by behind valk and Fuslie did yall see that?
16:01 🫣 I think you guys missed a full on weird looking shadow figure in the window behind the middle chair.. at exactly 16:01 you can see a head just before..... if not a person ? I think that's a freaky catch
HOLY MOLY, THIS VIDEO WAS SCARY AND INTENSE LOLLLL, LOTS OF SCARY STUFF HAPPENED THERE, STAY SAFE LESLIE, VALKYRAE, SAM AND COLBY ❤️🫶🏻😂😎🔥🥳🎊🎉💪👍✌️👏🔥🔥
@santea
16:01 shadow in the back ground?
GUYS IT'S COLBY'S BIRTHDAY TODAY, EVERYONE WISH HIM A HAPPY 27TH BIRTHDAY!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! <333
Man yall need to go to Galveston Tx...
Did anybody notice that colby turned back
The fact that they just skipped over pearl saying “he stole it from me” 😮 that scared the hell out of me and they didn’t even notice
Can you try inviting maybe mr beast hehe
Yo happy birthday Colby
BRING NATE BACKKKKKKK @solhardy2989
Bro my name is leslie to
This was one of my favorites! Rae & Leslie are awesome haha. Happy New Year and HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBYYYYYY 🎉❤
you guys should take CaseOh on a hunt that would be amazing 😂
@twinparanormal
Tayler holder Collab 😊
wow new fear unlocked Lmao XD
You guys should go to South Africa this year
Sam, Colby, please can you consider having the Meta Psyckicks girls Em and Liv go with you guys 🙏 They really are fans of you guys and would be pleased as punch if you let them come on the show. Please 🙏  I think it would be lots of fun. Please consider it 🙏
@mrbeast take him
You should do a video with the boys
We need new merch❤❤❤❤❤
Omg I have been watching you for 1-2 years and let me tell you I loooove your content
I love that you guys are bringing other people and showing them the possibilities of ghosts being real. Its really fun even more so when as the viewer know the guests. One thing I would have liked to see was after Rae and Colby did the Estes method with Pearl, would be a round with Sam and Leslie. Mostly because some what I have seen is that spirits react differently with different people, and it would be cool to see the responses you two would have gotten. Otherwise excellent video I can not wait until the next one
after i watched this video and went to bed i dreamed of colby and he was d34d 😭😭 i cried so hard but i realized it was a dream lol
Omg my name is William
What video is this from
Bro I could’ve met Sam and Colby 😭😭
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBYYY ❤🍰🎂🧁
is nobody going to talk about the figure running behind the plastic curtain at 16:00 😳😳😓
Happy birthday colby
Im so excited that you guys came to Alton!! This place has always given me chills when I drive past it! You guys should come back and check out McPike Mansion, which is right down the road from Mineral Springs!
did anybody see a shadow walk past the window with plastic at 16:00
Finally some friends along that don't make constant jokes and be annoying.
@samandcolby i really love your videos but it was genuinely more scary and felt more worth watching when it is just you two in your videos
YOU GUYS SHOULD DO IT WITH JULES AND SAUD !!!!
I am and will not claim any negative energy from watching this video nor from watching other videos from this channel and I do not want any of this spreading to any of my loved ones or myself throughout watching this series and thank you so much for listening to our side of the story❤ If I made any unnecessary glances thru the video I am sorry for that. You deserve respect, kindness and happiness. Please don’t attach to me or my loved and close ones.
On the 37.57 i so some lights like 2 eyes in another room
I dont claim, I dont allow any negative energy or spirit to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones while watching this video at all.
23:46 anyone else hear a woman say “and Lou?”
working in hospitality taught me yes,, every inn you drive by someone’s most likely either been murdered, murdered another being or simply offed themselves. sometimes all three in one. then there’s overdosing. dark, sad and always scary stories but unfortunately it happens everywhere. even in a “classy” Hilton hotel. Lol
I would love to have Sykkuno and Rae do this, it would be amazing!
I feel like Pearl and her husband just want to enjoy themselves but can’t due to them getting cursed. I think they were cursed because of George taking her ring when she passed.
Tell me y'all seen the shadow at 16:01
Squatters always have devil vibes, but secretly theyre angels protecting the slaughterhouse
Get mrbeast
everytime i think meh theyre just messing with us ghost arent real i watch other ghost channels and almost fall asleep and then go damn Sam and colby just do it better
Sam and Colby, I found a 100 year old bridge that supposedly a girl killed herself on and I have some very very disturbing footage of that night
25:20 look at Colby’s face after taking some shots😂😂🎉
Wow what a scary video this is so creepy!! And a good video too
Imagine a sam and colby x the boys colab that would be awsome
SAM AND COLBY U GUYS SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE LEMP MANSION i was having dinner there one night and saw a man in a top hat walk by me and then when i looked behind me to see him he wasn’t there there was me and maybe two other couples in the place
it’s crazy that it took 40 mins to even get to an investigation. I think the girls were cool but not made for a sam and Colby video. people wanna see you talking to ghosts not laughing and arguing about random things the whole time. disappointed
Dude I got chills I said fuck you George and Pearl said fuck him at the same time coincidence I think not...
I’m upset you guys were in Illinois and I didn’t know about it 😭😭😭
John wayne or the "killer clown" didnt kill anyone dressed as a clown. He worked as a clown at events etc so the media ran with that.
Happy birthday❤🎉
Im just a normal person but i want to go ghost hunting with sam and colby so bad!!
1:04:50 Leslie grabbing Sam and freaking out has me giggling so hard 🤣🤣😭
we need a colab between you guys and the sturniolo triplets plss, get them to a video
Can y'all please do a video with the twin paranormal River and Ryan and Wyatt.

Oh my God McPike mansion you’ll have to visit. I have visited when I was younger. My mom got dowsing rods from the lady that owns the building at the time . I’ve been waiting for y’all to do this for years !!!!!

She holds up the emf reader and goes, “my vibrator turned off”
ahaha Charlie, we looove you
51:41 no one hearing Colby say “Mickey” is actually hilarious🤣😭
Y’all should collab with The Boys. They’re getting more serious when it comes to ghost hunting, their lighthouse video is proof.

That dang pool is so spooky yet captivating. I see why people would spend hours in it. I know where I would be if I ever go there.
I do NOT allow any negative energy, entities, spirits, or anything else to come around me or the ones I love while watching this series. Thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you for everything you guys do. I’m sorry for any glances I made that I shouldn’t have.
Sam and Colby the YouTuber Kreekcraft is super nervous to go and all his fans want him to hunt ghost with you but he wants you guys to ask him can you ask him because HE IS SUPER FUNNY and gets scared so easily I bet it would be so fun
I dont know why this happened to me but after i watched this video i had a sharp pain in my back and i could not breath at all for a few secs im kinda nervous bc i dont know why this would happen
Happy birthday Colby I hope you and Sam have a better year
Tj hunt and dmaxryno from you tube

@jmancurly who wants him to go with Sam and Colby even though he can’t even handle a VR horror game😂😂 it would be so funny
I know Im a little late but,do you still like drummer girls?😂🤣
Did anyone else see the apparitions at 37:57 to 38:00 in the black hall way you can see 2 sets of eyes and one slowly turns t words them as the walk into its direction
The drinking and girls squeeling is so annoying.

Whatever you do, don't allow the Hollywood industry to move in on you  It has been reported in the news that Hollywood bosses require a pledge to Satan to get big contracts. And that Hollywood is run by Satan. And ihat its also used by the criminal deep state for mind control of the masses including the mind control of children. Reject their offers and money. Don't allow then to sponsor anything you do. Don't sell out to them. Its also been reported in the news that Hollywood often murders stars when their popularity is used up, and they kill by corrupt doctors using prescriptions for Big Pharma drugs that eventually kill them. It is called star killing.
Yo if Kai cenat was there it would Be crazy
love your guys adventures you guys should defenently do a video with the boys
Happy birthday Colby!!!!!!!!!!🎉
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY🎉🎉❤ I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD BURTHDAY WITH SAM

I love and appreciate you and Sam so much and your content genuinely makes me smile! Love you guys and I hope you have a happy birthday Colby!
I love these videos! Whenever I see you both post I immediately make sure to save the video for a perfect binge night. I love you both, and I hope you have an amazing 2024! Good luck on this new adventure. 🎉
Happy birthday, Colby, and happy New Year to both of you! I grew up watching your videos, and they got me through a lot of difficult times.
Yo Sam and Colby can you try calling me to the conjuring house in London pls no one read my comment😢

"Only rule is don't turn around" Yet rotates on a pivot to look around. "Don't turn around" means you have to walk in a circle to view behind you.
I'm sorry but bro is in 2023 cuz the way he said on God is crazy
Happy birthday
I am and will not claim any negative energy from watching this video nor from watching other videos from this channel and I do not want any of this spreading to any of my loved ones or myself throughout watching this series and thank you so much for listening to our side of the story❤ If I made any unnecessary glances thru the video I am sorry for that. You deserve respect, kindness and happiness. Please don’t attach to me or my loved and close ones.
@Amberscholl
You guys should go to Bismarck North Dakota and go the the Former Governors Mansion. I live here is Bismarck and have been to the mansion multiple times and have been touched multiple times
I hope they’ll do more ghost hunting videos w you someday, they were so good the way they seemed to actually wanna befriend the ghosts lol
Maybe I'm just a crotchety old Baby Boomer, but it seems to me that this channel is a vapid feckless nothing burger so big, and stacked so high with extra nothing that the entire expanding universe isn't and never will be big enough to contain its nothingness — which is ironic.
🙏👾I can't believe two of my favorite streamers and sam and colby filmed in Illinois while I was in Illinois to visit my boyfriend!!! -huge inhale- I love you all, Ill be sure to try to visit this place next time i visit Illinois!!❤
Hi Sam and Colby! I love your videos and content! Keep up the great work! Btw you should colab with The Boys in Australia! Anyway love your guys’s content ❤
Bro i love ghost investigations so i would love to meet sam and colby and they fine asf
You guys should go investigate CJ Fason’s haunted Pokomoke ranch house I’ve been watching and that place is very active 💯💯💯and Happy Birthday Colby 🎉
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY (His birthday is JAN 2!!!)
Would love to see a video with @CouRageReacts
Day one of asking to see @TheBoys in a sam and Colby video.. they even mentioned u in their new video going to the light house u guys yet too.
Guess they sold their souls to the industry finally lol. This vid gave major "got a visitor to talk about taking their career to the next level" vibes. The advertising the movie, the hyperactive nonstop motion and yelling that sounds like a coke head, the meme faces. Everything about this one felt so less like them than any vid I've seen
imma say this again bc why not, please try and bring ranboo onto a trip and i will also let you both know that Australia + Tasmania is a great place to ghost hunt, i will be saying the top nine in all of Australia and Tasmania 1. Princess Theatre, Melbourne, Victoria 2. Port Arthur, Tasmania 3. Aradale Lunatic Asylum, Ararat, Vic 4. North Kapunda Hotel, South Australia 5. Monte Cristo Homestead, Junee, NSW 6. Fremantle Arts Centre, Perth, Western Australia 7. National Film and Sound Archive, Canberra, ACT 8. Devil’s Pool, Babinda Boulders, Queensland 9. Mushroom Tunnel, Picton, NSW i will say that i have been to no.7 and it was a nice place to check out, but also was uncomfortable.       so i would be lovely to see you two go to Australia!
Collab with the boys fr
I got scratched by what I believe was a ghost it was normal then it burned and when I looked on my hip there where 3 marks
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!!!!
Colby was talking for pearl and Rae was talking for George
watching sam and colby in same and colby merch >>>
@coryxkenshin
Happy birthday Colby🎉
I'm so glad they're cleansing now LMAO they didn't do that a while ago
TAKE SCRIM AND RUBY NEXT TIME
sam and colby never fail to make me laugh 😭
I actually live in Alton and saw Rae in town wondering what they were doing in Alton. I do have to say tho I did get chills watching this even I’ve been within feet of this hotel not even knowing the backstories. My mom also owns a store like 1 mile from this and she has a door that’s locked that’s connected to the Underground Railroads which were use for slave transportation. If you guys didn’t know Alton was one of the main slave transporters which is the reason for the insane amount of underground railroads. Unfortunately it is just a tad bit illegal to see these things but it sure would be a heck of a video. With saying all that is was so nice to meet you Rae and I know a lot of other really haunted places in Alton that might be as chilling or even more chilling then this spot.
happy colby day guyssss
You should take
i do not claim anyone or anything or any energy from any sam and colby video and i do not claim you following or attaching to me or my loved ones thank you for sharing your storys they were amazing but i do not claim any unwanted energy thank you
I know you guys have a lot planned for 2024 but you guys should come to Tilton NH, there is a haunted hotel/restaurant. Its called Onions Pub and Restaurant. It is haunted by a little girl who died in a fire that happened there. She died in one of three fires that happened there. People say they hear a little girl talking and sometimes a silhouette of her. Thanks so much, i love watching your videos.
I love your videos I have been watching for a while
Dear Sam and Colby,   My name is Kylie, and I have been watching your videos since about 2 years ago, and to be honest, I was pretty scared to watch them at first, but, as time went on, I got used to the fact that spirits could be all around, and that the paranormal could happen almost everywhere you go. You guys have made me be able to get over my fear of the paranormal, and I’m so happy for that. You guys are incredibly sweet and amazing human beings that deserve all of the love and kindness that there is to bring. Sam and Colby, you two have helped me overcome some of my worst problems, one of them being anxiety, and another one being harming myself because things weren’t going the right way for me. Whenever I watch your videos, it makes me feel really, just..better about myself, you guys make me laugh, but also make me get jump scared every time you put one of those terrifying gifs or photos into the video without warning. I love your guys’ humour, and I hope that you can go into 2024 believing in yourself, and believing that you two are actually changing the world, day by day. Please, Sam and Colby, if you ever come to reading this, which is very unlikely, please  never forget that you two are helping a lot of people out by posting and by just being wonderful people who roam this earth. One day, during Hell Week in October, I was browsing in your online store, shopxplr.com, and I had a few tabs open of some things that I would’ve loved to get, one of them being the black hoodie with the large X covered in skulls on the back. I had asked my mom for it, and she had said “maybe”. I was doubting myself that I would get it or not, and as days went on, I started to think that I would never get it. But, it’s Sam and Colby, so I would never stop trying, I love you guys too much to stop. A few days later, I had checked the website again, and everything that I had wanted was sold out. I had told my mom about that as well, and she had said “oh, no, they’re sold out? I’m so sorry sweetie.” in a voice indicating that she was sad that I was sad. Little did I know that the hoodie I wanted would be one of my Christmas presents under the tree a few months later. It was Christmas Day, and me and my family were opening gifts, like we always did. I got a strange box, that looked like there was a stuffed animal inside, or something like that. As soon as I opened it, I saw a glimpse of the famous “X” logo, aka as your guys channel pfp. I was starting to cry. I knew what it was as soon as I saw the logo, and the black looking sweater. I took the sweater out of its box and looked at it, as if I was investigating it. Tears rolled down my cheeks, tears of happiness, to be exact. My mom had told me that it was a shame that they were all sold out, but she was just trying to cover up the fact that she had bought it for me while I was asleep. Funny, yeah. I love her for that. I took the sweater, and ran to my washroom, since it was the nearest room at the time, and swapped out of the gray hoodie that I had been wearing before, and put on the XPLR Hoodie. It was so soft. Oh my god. And it was extremely comfy, as it still is to this day. I’ve now been wearing that hoodie every day, because it comforts me and keeps me warm, since I do need that bit of warmth in the Winter in Canada, that being where I live. You guys really bring a smile to my face every time I see that you guys posted a video. You guys are my favourite YouTubers, and people, in the whole world. Nobody else could beat it, and I mean that. Thank you so much for everything that you’ve done for the community, and world. You guys seriously made a big impact on the beliefs of the afterlife and the paranormal after a lot of people had watched that one episode of One Week at The Conjuring House. It was impressive, I loved the series so much. It shocked me a lot when I realized that the spirit(I’m so sorry, I forget her name😭) was spelling out Sam and Colby’s family members names, as if it was so casual. I nearly cried again when I saw Sam crying over hearing that his grandma was watching over him. Tbh, I would’ve done the same. I might not see my grandparents a lot, but when they die, and if I ever heard from another spirit that they were watching over, I would most likely get a tear or two down my face. Fun fact, I’m pretty sure my room that’s in my house is somewhat haunted, because, some times in the night, and when I say night, I mean around 10PM—3am, I would randomly hear footsteps, sometimes loud, sometimes quiet, just all around my room. Usually where my carpet was, and I would usually see some shadow figures as well. They don’t seem to be malevolent though, from what I’ve seen. But you never know, they could be. I just haven’t figured that out yet. I should’ve been scared, I should’ve been scared of the footsteps, the tall figures, the shadows, some voices, but..you guys taught me how to not be scared of the paranormal, and to not be scared of anything around that topic, I used to hide under my blankets for “protection” when I was scared, but now, I don’t even mind it. I just carry on with my day, while being a tad bit suspicious of what had happened. It would slide off of my brain at some point, hopefully. Again, you guys taught so many people to not be scared of the paranormal, but, you guys did teach us something to actually be scared of, and that was to be scared of insects. Lmao. You guys may never see this comment because this is one of the many many comments out there, so it’ll be very unlikely for you to see this. Worth a shot though. I love you guys way too much to not comment this, I hope it made your day a bit better, Sam and Colby. Keep being the silly humans that you are, you are truly making a change in the world. <33
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!!! 🎉🎉🎉 I don’t have TikTok or Instagram so this is the only thing I could use!! LOVE YOU BOTH KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!! ❤❤❤ We all appreciate everything you do. ❤
Umm I will not watch Night Swim bc the trailer showed a cat that dies . No thank you!

hi sam and colby I talked to a spirit before christmas through a spirit box and I talked to a nun a demon a 12 year old girl from 1928 and some other spirits at my school and my school is near a museum that use to be a school. I have a forest in the back yard of my house which has some spirits there and i heard a male and a female scream from that forest I was wondering if it is a good idea to explore the forest because also my sister said that there is a some what demonic entity that makes it so you can not fully find away out for a while because the entity makes it so your sense of direction is of and I also live near a hospital.
Jan 2 is today and it is Colby’s birthday so I shall say happy birthday Colby!

I live like an hour away from Alton Illinois...that's crazy to me
At 15:56 in the middle window you can see a black figure move quickly past it
Hey you should put me on your channel some time I'm a Psychic I'm not all that great yet I can feel a Presence and can tell if it's good or bad same with energy I can see spirts and hear them some times I will get a vision in my head or I will hear a sound that connects with dead person some times there emotions will reflect on me Weather to dead person or someone that's alive sometimes taste things like let's say someone's favorite food was chocolate pie and I taste it mouth and I suddenly say chocolate pie!!! And it was someone's aunts favorite food. And sometimes if I sit in silence I can have a full blown conversation with a dead person and start to get to know there story or so on so on there so much more to me to I can heal people's negative energy if they go into places like this I'm basically a huge Quartz Crystal my hands and eyes are the ones I know so far that heal plus I feel like you could use some that could heal you with Incense oils crystals herbs candles crystals and all of that stuff
Love the video   Edit :happy b'day colby y yYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Nah cuz how the fuck sam and colby get sponsored my universal pictures? Sam and Colby. The movie???
Nah someone found something in your conjuring house series. I just turned up the exposure and everything and then saw it. It looking through a window right after Sam get a strange headache then Sam turns to look at the window but as he turns it moves away from the window. This was down in the basement I think.

Ooooouuuu callab with Zak Begans and Aaron Goodwin from ghost adventures   LIKE IF YOU AGREE ❤❤
I live in Illinois-
Happy birthday❤️❤️
I want to go on a spooky adventure with you guys!
thank you for visiting my home town. Soooo much more within 15 minutes of mineral springs is very worthy of exploring..kids around here do these sort of things for fun! abandoned factories are 2 turns away past bing feild, and a mansion that sits on top of the caves where the piasa bird is painted as well as rooms created by the lime stone... St.louis is a 30 minute drive where the fun doubles! cementland is a days trip itself
It's not y'all first haunted pool Sam and colby the pool in the queen Mary is haunted to
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COBLY!!!!
Hi Sam Colby I am a really big fan of your ghost videos and I would really like to be in one of your videos how can I be in one of your ghost videos?
(Casual Flex?)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY WE LOVE U🎉🎉🎉🎉!
Happy birthday colbyyyyy
The facial expressions are priceless 😂happy new years sam and Colby and happy birthday Colby 🎉❤
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!!!! LOVE YOU!!!! LOVE YOU TO SAM LOVE YOU BOTH!!!!! HOPE YOU HAVE THE MOST BEST BIRTHDAY EVER AND HAVE A BLAST!!!!❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
At 16:02 was that Sam's or Colby's reflection on the window or something else??
I may not watch you but happy birthday Colby !
The boys you should make a video with then
Happy birthday Colby! Hope you had a great time!!!! (Also I loved this video)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY 🎉🎉🎉❤
shoutout to alton❤️
may be reaching but towards the end when they were in the slaughterhouse just about to leave to go up to pearls room and they said that, the spirits said ‘tomb’ what if they were speaking about pearls room as they were ‘cursed’ and they are stuck in a loop??
I CAME HERE TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBYYYYY! 🫶 ALSO! there’s a city in california called redlands and apparently it’s  one of the most haunted cities in america! if u do research on it, it has places that are very haunted there’s these 2 most well known places in redlands that are very haunted called, prospect park, (that’s haunted by an 11 year old girl) and the barton mansion (that’s is haunted by a demon) i would love to see u guys to ghost hunt there! 🖤
Happy B day Colby 🎉❤
u guys need to do a collab with the boys
I think you should take coreyxkenshin and the boys group  it would be really good
I do like Sam & Colby but I have to say how are we supposed to take the video seriously when they themselves and or their guests don’t take it seriously with all the jokes and overreacting. I honestly prefer just Sam & Colby doing investigations on their own. The girl guests are mostly super annoying, loud, talking through everything, yelling etc. Aside from that these guys seem more genuine than most of the other YouTubers doing these kind of video’s. No offense to you Sam & Colby, just my opinion. You guys are awesome and do love the video’s
I wish I could see this investigated in a serious way, I hate these guests. Absolutely annoying. I love Sam and Colby!
I'm suspicious of those flashlights.
IDK who Leslie is but she's fine as hell and funny 🤣
IM TRIPPING RN BUT IN PEARLS ROOM WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW MANY DAYS IT TOOK HER HUSBAND TO REPORT HER MISSING I WAS LOOKING AT THE WINDOW AND THERE WAS A PERSONS SHADOW BUT NOBODY WAS MOVING AT ALL SO PLEASE LOOK BACK AT THE FOOTAGE AND PORVE ME RIGHT OR WRONG
they should take sssniperwolf id pay to see it
Please reach out to @Watcher. I feel like we need Sam and Colby with Ryan and Shane!!  Bringing in @ProjectFear again is always amazing!!
Can you ask Mykie, from Glam&GoreMakeup, to go with you? They are doing some huntings to 🤩  And more of Kmk and Celina 😍
ik this was 3 days ago but i’m watching it on colby’s birthday which to me is close enough so HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY❤🎉❤🎉
So there is this dutch youtuber who does not only ghost hunt stuff but i think je would like to go with you guys @stefandevries
i hope rae changes her mind and you guys do another video with her and leslie maybe like more with positive spirits maybe bring celena and kris too I think that could be a really dope experience and investigation maybe see if you guys could help pearl and them get uncursed and free to move on to their next life or a whole other locations of just good vibes :D
imagine bringing back Jennifer from 4 years ago from the Stanley hotel, the girl who gave you the idea of the witches forest, what if you guys all go back to her grandpas cabin if he’s still alive or if you’re still in contact. seems like a good idea
Happy birthday Colby keep slaying everyday away love you queen 👑💅
Happy birthday🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
NEW YEAR, NEW ME.
The girls ruined this for me- and they have know clue on Gacy?? Clout
Yo did no one see the glowing white eyes in the doorway when they start walking to the pool after they do the thing where they can't look behind them 😨
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!!
dont look over your shoulders,,, like colby did looking at the stairs... hmmmmm
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY
It's funny how they have like no hate comments, but to be honest if you're going to hate you don't have to watch the video.
The part where everyone was slowly shifting away from Colby had me dying 😆
I sure that I subscribed 4 years ago
never let these two back on the channel
@cjades would be awesome! I would love to see them make a video together!
Happy birthday colby

Summary:  02:12 🏨 The Mineral Springs Hotel in Alton, Illinois, is considered the most haunted small town in America, with a history dating back to the 1100s. 05:40 👻 The sub-basement, known as the slaughterhouse, has a dark history, rumored for Satanic rituals, making it a focal point for negative spiritual energy. 08:47 🏊 The basement pool area is the most active location in the Mineral Springs Hotel, with reported phenomena like splashing water, wet footprints, and a 7-foot tall shadow figure named William. 16:40 👰 The Lady in Blue, Pearl, haunts the hotel after her tragic death, with her abusive husband George also believed to be a spirit tormenting her in the afterlife. 17:38 🔮 The Soul Asylum Museum within the hotel houses haunted objects, serial killer memorabilia, and real human remains, potentially contributing to the charged energy throughout the hotel. 21:56 🕵 The town is haunted due to a giant Mineral Spring connecting to a well, potentially serving as a portal for spirits. 23:22 🧲 Ghost investigation tools include flashlights manipulated by spirits and a rim pod detecting electromagnetic fields. 24:44 🥂 Spirits seem to respond positively to toasting and taking shots; flashlight flickering suggests communication with the ghost Lou. 27:36 🌟 The paranormal investigation intensifies with the hosting game, limiting participants from turning around for an hour to communicate with spirits. 42:11 👻 Despite efforts, the investigation in the haunted pool doesn't yield significant spirit communication, leaving the team perplexed. 42:38 🎉 The group has a backup plan in case things go wrong during their paranormal investigation. 44:02 🤯 Binaural beats are used to create a trance-like state for potential spirit communication. 45:14 👻 The spirit communicates a name, "Michael," during the investigation. 46:40 🍰 Despite encountering spooky phenomena, the group lightens the mood with cupcakes at their gathering. 58:41 🕵 The SLS camera captures anomalous figures in chairs, possibly indicating the presence of spirits George and Pearl. 01:04:20 🔄 George and Pearl, trapped spirits, are cursed to relive their past, communicating with the investigators. 01:05:01 😱 The investigators have a vivid conversation with the spirits, experiencing their troubled history. 01:05:43 🤯 The spirits' repeating storyline is revealed, trapped in a cycle of reliving their past. 01:06:13 🎭 The investigators are unsure if one or both spirits were communicating, creating an eerie and realistic encounter. 01:07:09 😨 The pool experience stands out as the scariest for the investigators, inducing intense fear and discomfort.
Happy birthday colby

So y'all gonna say anything about the Bellaire house footage or...
Sam and Colby keep saying it's their first time seeing a haunted pool, but it's not because of the Queen Mary swimming pool
A museum of haunted items my kind of museum
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening our side of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may have everyone give you the upmost respect! May you rest in peace.

Sam and Colby I think there’s one location you need to investigate have you ever heard of the birdcage theater in tombstone, Arizona Zack, Baggins, and the ghost adventures crew did a video there and I think you guys should do your own investigation there
You guys need to get @eleanorneale in a video !!
Hi sam or colby can you clear the rumor  if you guys are dating any one to me these girls seem like friends
at 24:17 is it just me or did a like a little girl voice say “ hi..”??

34:32 Colby got the :o face and it's quite funny how they filmed this on November 11th, but released it at this time.
great episode i know they probably won't be back but it was awesome to see you guys together
“This is so creepy we’re having a conversation with him!!”  Gorge-“On god”
Video 1 of asking SnC to go to place without any prior knowledge and learn about the  place from the spirits and when they leave to see if any of the information lines up
Michael from the Crescent hotel???? He could have followed them not saying that he did but he could have.
Happy birthday Colby

Markiplier would be an amazing person to take ghost hunting or even Jacksepticeye, I think y’all’s energies would be phenomenal.

One thing that Colby said when doing the Estes method he said “he stole it” referring to when the husbands first thing was to take the wedding ring
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
You guys should go to the Conrad museum.. there’s been creepy stuff there.
I do NOT allow any negative energy, entities, spirits, or anything else to come around me or the ones I love while watching this series. Thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you for everything you guys do. I’m sorry for any glances I made that I shouldn’t have.

I live in Alton. Gotta say Mineral Springs is an awesome spot. I wish y'all could investigate The McPike Mansion or The First Unitarian Church here or the civil war prison wall.
@samandcolby  you guys should meet up with @ghostfiles
happy birth day Colby
You guys should do one with the Project Fear crew again! Everyone this time ❤️
Alton is a 25,000 person town, and they call it small. My town is less than 500 people. 😂

Hello Sam and Colby, I'm 16 living in the UK and have been a huge fan of yours for a while now, I absolutely love paranormal investigations and have always wanted to go on one but have never had the right equipment and none of my friends are brave enough, I want to be able to believe 100%. In the future I would like to do a paranormal investigation with you guys one day and be able to experience something paranormal with my favourite paranormal investigators, I hope you read this message :) Love you guys and keep up with the good work :)
Did she talk abt a vibratior  at 26:30 through 26:33

HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!!!!!

POV man lebt in DEUTSCHLAND 😢
Hey Sam and Colby we heard that rose hotel is haunted you guys should go there for a video its in Elizabethtown in IL. We hope that you guys could go it’s over 211 years old
You asked who you should possibly do videos with in the future and I just want to shout out to Kelsi Davis. I am a newer follower of this tribe and I have no idea if you heard of her or already have done a video with her yet. But I believe she would be an awesome person to take with you. She has a haunted doll named Lola and has other haunted vessels. I believe she is just amazing person who spread light and love to others. She would really help your next ghostly adventure. Kelsi Davies is someone you definitely need to partner with.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY🎉
happy birthday colby!!!!❤️❤️🎉🎉
Happy birthday colby 🎂
The his videos are amazing. Seeing popular YouTubers going out of their comfort zone while you laugh at them is so funny. Keep it up and try to get Jesser and Fazerug in a video together
Sam and Colby, my plan is to fly to Las Vegas around here and meet you. Only I'm 12 years old and I come from Poland and I'm very afraid of flying. If I knew exactly where Where do you live? I would like to visit you sometime! How about meeting your resident viewer 5,751 miles away ?
Yall should bring back the og group
Happy birthday Colby! I hope you having an amazing day<3
Definitely my favorite colab !!!
HAPPY 27TH BIRTHDAY COLBY!!! 💙💙💙💙💙

Happy birthday Colby
1/02/24  HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY
I love this vid like the pool is honestly rlly creepy. ALSO HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY🎉
WHEN THEY WERE TELLING THE STORY ITS THE SAME STORY AS THE MINERAL WELLS TOWN ONE IN TEXAS
Who’s here on colbys birthday 🎉🎉
Sam made the comment about thinking not a lot of people die at the Holiday Inn. I use to be a 9-1-1 dispatcher and SO many people die in hotels. A majority of it are overdoses. Hotels are a common place where homeless people stay and there is a huge drug problem associated with homeless people. So you do too much and overdose. If someone doesn’t find you in time then that’s it.
Sam and Colby at 0:40 :Where’s Leslie,She’s probably under this hair thing   Me:Naw she just put her hair over her face
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!
Do a Collab with  the boys
Pleasee go with @theboys they recently covered your conjuring series. They also started taking paranormal places more seriously. Please check them out 🫶

HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY
HAPPY B-day Colby
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY !
you lost me on the stick figure camera. they literally just snap the 'persons' limbs to the chairs' legs because the camera interprets the chairs as people. probably works worse on the third chair as it is built diffferently even though we caught a glimpse of it working at 1:00:05
Happy birthday colby🎉🎉🎉🎉
15:59 something flies past window
HAPPY NEW YEAR BITCHES LOVE YALL SO MUCH
Hi Sam and Colby! I love your videos and I know you've been doing haunted hotels, so I suggest The Andrew Jackson hotel in New Orleans, LA I think you'd botuvenjoy it's story but it's just a suggestion I don't want to push you both into doing something! Again lovevyour videos ❤
bring The Boys with you
Happy birthday Colby!! (I think I’m late or early but idk)
Happy birthday colby

I’m just trying issues you’re not going anywhere I just don’t know how I can uu
19:53 crime museums are the best
Coming here to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBYYY. 🩶 Wish you a great damn birthday.
They were supposed to not look behind them at the pool but Colby did it twice
Happy birthday
I don’t know why, but as a long time follower I feel like you guys don’t take this whole paranormal this as seriously as you guys used to. You guys used to respect the location and the spirits and now it feels like half the video is you guys joking around and disrespecting the spirits. On top of that, these “rituals” you guys are doing seems like a way to fill in the gaps for an otherwise lacking video.. My mom and I are huge fans of your show and it’s been our routine to watch your episodes weekly but lately it hasn’t been the same. It may just be us, but the respect is no longer there and it seems to all just be a paycheck for you guys now..
You guys should do the excorcist house
HAPPY NEW YEAR AND BIRTHDAY COLOBY BROCK
The boys plz plz plz plz plz
I feel like they should go to the cecil hotel
You should make a video with the boys (josh dub,mully,Eddie,narrator,juicy) especially because they have done some haunted places before like clown hotel
Omg you need to take Ryan Trahan
Happy birthday Colby
ima play the bad advocate here, if there is no physical evidence apart from a game of telephone of him abusing her (follow me). What if she was going to that hotel to cheat, she would tell him she was going to her moms or on business trips etc  and he thought nothing of it but after the 2 days she said she would be back he got worried. He wanted the ring back and didnt care cause he was suspecting she had been cheating and simply wanted the ring.  Yeah i know this is a stretch but i mean if the ONLY evidence to the story being that he was abusive is heresay then i dont think its wrong to speculate. She could have been comiung home with brusing from other parteners and he would send her to the hospital thinking she had a condition.  Maybe he is in the hotel as well cause he still loves her and wants to be with her. Who knows?   P.S.    IF there is physical evidence he beat her i retract this statment lmao
At 30:15 me and Sam said the same thing
ITS 1/2/24 COLBY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!❤
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY
Its a very good video Loved it, You should team up with the Boys next time
happy birthday colby!!!!!!!🥳🥳🥳

Happy birthday Colby 🎉🍰 love u
HAPPY BIRTHDAY Colby ❤
@watcher pl collab with em
I got a bit of goosebumps when i read the match part instruction in the hosting game ritual  Strike the third match. If the third match lights on the first strike: Say, “Now everyone is here!” and count from one to 10 once more. If you have done this correctly, you will be able to hear and/or feel whispering, rustling, or a quiet “thank you” behind you.
OMG PLZ DO A COLAB WITH SHANE AND RYAN PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBYYYYYY AND HAPPY NEW YEAR SAM!!!!!!!!!!! You guys are the best YouTubers and Ik that you probably won’t see this but you are the best and funniest YouTubers I’ve ever watched or known of! You saved me. I love you Guys so so so much and I can’t wait to see what videos you post this year! Keep up the good work!

Can you go to the Fox Hollow farm? it was owned by a serial killer and I have seen an episode of it from ghost adventure and it would be fun if you guys went there.

January 2  Happy Birthday Colby 🎉🎂🥳🎈🎊🎁
imma be honest, no hate towards anyone on this video or has been on this channel, but i hate it when people are dramatic asf during investigations
When Sam said: Its very cool to see a haunted pool for the firs time.I think saw one before it was at the Ghost ship(Queen Mary) a think it was a a little girl who drowned in the pool.And now the pool is closed.
Happy birthday colby🎉🥳❤️
WHAT WAS THAT SING AT THE END I NEED IT
Happy birthday
🤜✌️🎶🫵
😅 I genuinely enjoy watching Sam's little spirit games he finds and puts into these. I really was surprised that last match light up 😂
ok I’m scared bc I went on a ghost tour there and they didn’t show us that hotel but I do live somewhat close do Alton and I’m afraid that the tour guy didn’t want to take us there bc of the spirits..
Happy birthday Colby 🎉❤
Happy birthday Colby 🎉
at the pool, i couldn't stop thinking about fnaf with William and Cassie (cassidy)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY ENJOY YOUR DAY!!!!!!!!!!!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!!
My actual name is Abigail Arnold the spirit from the conjuring house died on my birthday. Y’all should take me there
Happy birthday colby!
Was I the only 1 to notice that Colby kinda turned around when they were playing that game in the pool? I think that's why most of the things kinda didn't work out.
chaotic ghost hunt is not for me
People who heard Colby call Sam babe at 17:58 listen closely
I would actually go ghost hunting with you guys that has been my thing for a very long time. I think it would be amazing to go ghost hunting with two legends like you guys
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!
Sam and Colby haven’t posted in a year😢 I miss the old memories 😔

Happy birthday, colby🎉
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

You should bring them with the two people from the conjuring (forgot the names)
the shot or 2 would probably have helped lower the barrier... n help connection.. I know it helps me with connection and stuff
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY PLEASE NOTICE THIS COMMENT I'VE BEEN WATCHING  EVER SINCE  YOU STARTED YOUTUBE
I dont claim any negative energy from this video
The girl in green lowk annoyed me😂
Come on guys! John Wayne Gacy did not kill people or little kids while wearing a clown costume! Yes, he did murder a lot of young men and teenaged boys 33 in total but not while he was dressed up as a clown! And he did not lure little kids under his house, he buried his victims under his house and some around his yard! When he dressed up as Pogo The Clown he did fundraising events and parades.  **Side note** I love Sam and Colby! And,  I am in no way shape or form condoning or defending this horrible monster John Wayne Gacy, I’m just correcting what was said about him in this video!  This is how so much information gets misconstrued by people when someone in a video says something and others just agree because they either don’t want to correct the person or they just don’t know so they just say “ya, he dressed up as a clown and killed little kids!”
Movie coming out on my bday? Yaey
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY ❤❤
I wonder if they blow the girls back out during cuts
Becuse we are muslim  we throw rocks at the devils because of that threre trading😂😂
When everything in america is most hunted it becomes average and in the end it is just hunted.

it would be super cool to see you guys do an investigation with bunny (grav3yardgirl) OG’s know she used to love doing that type of stuff and maybe would be down
People who know if a video is a hour most of it is talking about it
Happy birthday Colby!!
A friend drinking Jack ♠️in leather and a sweater is much much better at Placebo Springs than any other❤️ 🔥  A gamma pond portal in proximity, at that 👍🏻  Woke at 3:19 am from a dream..to deciding to rewatch. After the portal gamma ray pond jumping game explanation..my new “wall” EMF, that I had turned off 3 minutes prior..turned itself back on and recalibrated after I had asked the question about my dream, while watching your video. This is all I can say currently without writing a book in the comments.      4 beautiful, fellow gamma pond jumpers..😍😍😍😍  Yes, follow me🔥
you guys should really go to mineral wells Texas there town is so crazy and there is so many haunted places from hotel to houses that are haunted they even do a ghost walk. there town was based on mineral wells that "cured" illnesses they still have water being sold to this day called crazy water. they have two main hotels one the baker hotel and the other is the crazy hotel. my great grandmother lives there and I was able to do the ghost walk you learn some crazy stuff.
@laurenzside should do a collaboration with you guys! That would be so fun! And @jacksepticeye.

am I the only one who saw third stick figure near the wall at 1:00:05 something 💀
We love Rea and Leslie! I feel like rea is such a sensitive person..like things attrackt to her. But she also gives off Boss vibes..and leslie is like the sister vibe.  The funniest moment on stream when miyoung turned the power down... and Rea and Leslie where freaking out!.. "send him back!" Lol
Happy birthday Colby
Yall my lil cuzzin gabriel is 7 years old and he legit has watched almost everyone of sam and colbys videos he tells me his goal is to become a ghost hunting youtuber just like them and one day make a video with them lol no joke when Colby had cancer he cried because he thought he was going to die 😢

I do not claim any energy from this video 🙏🏻
Happy Birthday Colby and Happy New Years Sam and Colby. 🩷🩷🩷🩷
sturniolo triplets PLEASSE
I've always wanted to go on a ghost hunt, but nah, I had to be blessed with a insect/spider phobia (That's stupidly bad), so sadly not happening in this this life, with places like these. I'd sooner be attacked/jump scared by a bug before a spirit, or a ghost insect with my stupid luck (they sense my fear I swear!) . Maybe in my next life I wont be so borked in the head so I can do something like this, that I've always had a high sense of curiosity for.  😭Until then, least I can watch the theatrical vibe of videos like this.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Happy birthday Colby
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COBLY WE LOVE YALL ❤️🌸
OMG THIS IS MY HOMETOWN! I LOVE DONNA & DAVE 💕 Thank you for visiting!!!

Happy birthday, Colby! I hope you have a wonderful day and have good things coming for you in the next year. Keep doing what you are doing, be happy and healthy. ❤️ Me x
May God bless you
Sam and Colby if your reading this you have obviously seen my comment but i am only hear to say that 2023 has been an amazing year for me and my family but you have only made it better for me and when i heard about your cancer Colby i was in shock i couldnt believe it and i didnt want anything worse than that to happen to you so Sam and You (Colby) i could understand why you were extatic after hearing that Colbys cancer was gone and honestly, thank you so so much for making this the year it has been.
This is the only video i've gotten bad vibes from lol, specially only the hosting game part.
love this

30:27 a voice said ANSWER ME !  A male voice right ?
why is nobody talking about colby using is penis as a transition😭
When I went to Fairfield to visit my dad's parents for Christmas, the next day I and my family went to the mall, I went to Zumiez and got 10 of your guys' merch and I'm glad that I got them in-store because the worker said that they were selling fast.
i dont claim any negative energy from this video amen🙏
You should bring Cody ko, markiplier, or jacksepticeye on a investigation
Happy birthday colby!
Is it just me or something moved behind Leslie at 16:01 ?
THE WAY RAE SAID 'You better believe it' JUST GOT ME. IT WAS SO FUNNY

HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY🎉
You guys should go to the White House for a investigation or try to.
How is Colby so fine in every video 📸
Happy birthday Colby 🎉
16:02  alright no one saw that in the window?
Phasmophobia is the best horror game
Just bring Chris and Selena. Any other girls are so fucking dramatic and be talking way too much  they ruined the video
OMG IM A THERIAN AND WHILE I WAS DOING QUADROBICS I ACCIDENTALLY DID A BIG CRASH AND THEY SAID,”wtf was that? That was like a crash”
Happppppy birthday Colby I know you will probably not see this but I wish you a happy birthday 🦋🎂🩷🧡💛💚🩵💙💜❤️‍🔥💗💓💝
I really prefer when they do the hunting by themselves  having extra people that doesn’t know anything about it  in this is so annoying because it just turn to be talking and laughing and it kills the mood
I'm in LA been watching since suicide bridge and Cobb estate. I'm all game for an investigation in 2024 🎉
𝙸 𝓁𝒾𝓋𝑒 tׁׅhׁׅ֮⁠ꫀׁׅ⁠ܻ݊ꭈׁׅ⁠ꫀׁׅ⁠ܻ݊
me living in illinois and passing by this place casually while ghost hunters go wild inside lmao
Tbh yall should go to the beck house in canada ontario I have drove past it so many times
I'm here on January 2nd HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY ILY SM❤🎉
Everytime I start watching Sam and colbys videos, it makes me want to ghost hunt with them so much more, I’ve never ghost hunted and I keep talking myself out of it😅
Would love to see a colab with Narrator, Kruz and Niko Ortiz
Colby you have the same birthday as my brother 2.124
meow
you should do a vid with @ranboo and @almsey
40:04   Bebè
I mean I’m not a creator but you should take me with you two one
40:01 whats that above you guys?
Happy birthday colbyyy!
anyone see the glowing eyes in the right doorway at 37:57?
Happy birthday Colby 🎊 🎉
you guys should do a collab with EddieVr or Blesiv i definitely think they'd be down for it!
omg wait a video with oompaville/kaleb/kris' boyfriend would be so fun, and stephanie soo! she is one of my favorites
Heck no made me feel paranoid 😅 when you guys couldn't look back...scared asf
You guys should go ghost hunting with the Life of luxury they do some wild things but idk if they can handle this type of stuff so go hit them up
the real miracle is that leslie succeeded in not looking back
Hii
I'd love to know where they find their rituals
I straight up love your videos! Keep up the work guys! Hoping one day to be able to end up like you guys or even better investigate with you guys one day! J starting my paranormal route and it’s crazy!
Loved "Bébé."
at 12:04 i bet he said the n word lmao
Is that a face behind Sam? 51:49
leslie didn’t say what the scale of what she believes in the paranormal is lol.
casually getting sponsored by UNIVERSAL
Just got the X rose hoodie from zumiez and I absolutely love it! Super comfy! A collab with Ethan Nestor would be great!
Anyone else think they should 100% take jynxzi ghost hunting
The Vanoss crew should do this 😭
I already know every single person that watch this video did not want that third match to light up to see what would happen😂
Guys 2023 was such a big year for you.  The Conjuring House really helped bring you a new audience, and I feel it brought you and your fans closer.  I'm a skeptic, but I believe you guys experienced something truly supernatural there.  And watching you go through something so personal and life changing, and reading all the comments people were writing about how those videos affected them, it really touched so many people and brought us all together as fans.  Colby, I'm glad your health got better and you were able to come back stronger.    But I did have an idea for you guys.  You talked about collaborations with our favorite YouTubers. I'd love to see you do something with MindSeed or Ben at Caspersight.  But what I think would be really cool is if you brought one of your skeptics on a Ghost Hunt.  Bring one of these Debunkers who think they know how everything is done.  Not in any malicious way. But show them what you experience.  Let them see and hear and FEEL what you experience and see if they don't change their mind.  And I don't mean let them test you, or go back to the conjuring house.  Just bring them to whatever place you are going next.  I want to see them eat their words.
More videos with rae n leslie
They NEED to do a collab with the BOYS
Happy Birthday Cobly 🎉🎉🎉
When are you and the boys gonna colab?
Go ghost hunting with @thesefoos
Did anyone notice what seemed to be glowing eyes looking into Pearl's room in the dark by the door behind Colby at 1:01:26?? It happens a few more times after. But congrats Sam and Colby on your Universal sponsor and hopefully we can see you investigate with the whole project fear cast!
what if you say what they while they were doing the hosting game?????
Happy birthday Colby! And happy new year to the both of you. I’m looking forward to this next year ahead of us and I’m excited to see what amazing places you visit and things you accomplish in 2024. Thank you for an awesome year!
Happy birthday Colby hope you have a great day and I love you're video so much  🩷
OMG i wish I would’ve meet yall im from alton Illinois i love yall youtube channel
I would love to ghost hunt with you guys lol
Happy birthday colby!!!
You are awesome and you should really come to Indiana and explore the Indiana state sanatorium/ lee Alan Bryant home I have been there and this building has a ton of paranormal activity even in the day and it is open to rent out or do day or night tours
@jessiivee

HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY!!! ❤️🥳🎉🎈🎊🎁🍾🪩 WOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

Hey Sam and Colby! I just wanted to let yk bc I found it rlly funny! That when you guys were in the pool trying to talk to Cassie I was just laughing bc my name is Cassie and I just found it rlly funny! And thank you for all of your hard work with these videos! Love you both sm!!
I think that Sam shouldve pointed the SLS camera behind leslie when they said "I'm watching" and "turn around" :0 maybe they'd get something
this was exciting especially since it’s in my state
you  should have @eddievr join you guys on one of your guys' ghost investigations
THE FACT THAT VALKYRAE WAS IN MY STATE OMG
i dont claim no negative energy from this vid
Who here needs dating advice?
Sam and Colby really random suggestion  it I have noticed that you guys have been doing a lot of videos with streamers lately I would love to see a vid with a streamer named ranboo they are amazing Nikki nihachu now’s them and Wilbur soot now’s them too it would be really cool to see ranboo in one of your vids. This is just a suggestion for future vids idk if your even going to see this.
hey Colby I know you might not see this but HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAYYYY (12:46 am Tue Jan 2 2024)
While you guys were doing the thing in the pool. I was so focused till Colby was handed the thing and then started posing like a professional model. That caught me off guard😭😭😭 STILL I LOVE ALL YOUR VIDEOS!!! YOU ALWAYS BOTH DO SUCH AN AMAZING JOB ❤❤❤❤
I need to see you guys with The Boys this year, plss omg I need to see it.
I really want to go with y'all sometime and and investigate some haunted places with you I've been dreaming honestly about doing it for years now ever since I started watching y'all I was like I really really wish one day that I can go with Sam and Colby and go do some ghost hunting because there's a few places here in Georgia that I think y'all would love to investigate
Yes Sam and colby 👹👹👹👹👹
Yall should investigate the Appalachian Mountains
COLLAB WITH SHANE AND RYAN PLEASEEEEEE
During the Estes method, i think for sure that Colby was Pearl and Rae was George
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY 🎈🎉
Try to get the YouTubers The Boys
Anyone else watching this at night😊 what a good way to watch and then after got asleep
1:00:23 it may be because Sam was moving it but there's like a giant deformed body. Also, you have to pause fast because it's for a split second.
colby I have the same birthday as you
Y’all should bring Eddievr
Great video guys! Entertaining and informative and eye opening! Girls were adorable and funny! 2 thumbs up!
i cannot believe this place is 4 hours away from me😭😭😭
Hay im just going to say first that fall for the contract if someone comes up Usain will give you billions of dollars if you sign this contract don't do it do not do it you're basically saying your life over to the government and to the devil please don't do it you are too cool to be doing that and I love y'all's videos so much y'all are real ghost hunters and y'all have made it so far good job guys 🎉🎉
I WANT A HOODIE BUT ITS 64 DOLLARS 😭
Love you sam and colby❤️ you guys are amazing
I am begging you to go to the Indiana Penitentiary.I had a crazy experiences there.
Y’all think it was St.Micheal in the pool and that “orb” in November? For any Catholics out there? I LITERALLY LOVE SAM AND COLBY THEY ARE THE BEST
“On God”? So the ghosts use Gen Z slang terms now? I’m surprised he didn’t say “you’re so cringe”.
you guys are amazing and helped me when i was about to kms and i'm happy that you guys has helped me i hope you have a best time with any thing you do and i love this video
finally!! ❤❤
41:48 colby looked back hellaaaaa 😬
Fun fact: Michael is the name of an Archangel, Michael is of Hebrew origin and means “who is like God” or “gift from God.” It is found in the Old Testament, notably in the Book of Daniel.  Pronunciation: mye-kehl.
I wish you guys would stop using the Alice box ☹️ it has such a small verity of words and they’re most likely to be creepy. Inaccurate equipment
Bring LLS on a video
Happy birthday Colby 🎉
Bro when u guys were at the haunted pool I was shit scared of that 7 foot tall William mf and it was so fuckin dark to
Sam and Colbey u should get them out again
Y’all are like “ psychosis” idk if the drugs induced it or it a mental disorder what came first lol

Happy birthday Colby!! Cmon everyone comment happy birthday for colby🎉🎉🎉🎉
If you’re watching the Alton video whilst living in Alton, raise your hand!!!! We been waiting for this one to air
I like how in the beginning of the Estes method (imagine the husband communicated through Colby and the wife through Rae) Colby’s side sounded  more controlling whereas Rae’s was more quiet.. per usual in an abusive relationship.
I’d love to see yall go back to the queen mary!!
Happy New Year Sam and Colby. Love all your videos and collaborations. I would love to see you both with Twin Paranormal do a very well known place you have investigated before which is Dracula's Castle. I think the five of you could really get some amazing evidence together. I am a forever fan of Sam and Colby and Twin Paranormal. Can't wait to see what you all have planned for 2024. Please come to Baltimore MD and do some investigating. Love you guys safe travels
2:16
S:16
I need Cory on a vid
Jack Daniel's was that...great choice! My choice of liquor in my drinking days...jack and coke!
You should investigate more hospitals !
I don't claim any negative energy from this video.
So lobotomy started back in the day when they still thought that people who were mentally ill had demons in their head so they would make a hole in their head in order for the bad spirits to escape. Mental illness was still not yet understood then it was used during the days of yore
Happy Birthday Colby🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
whos been watching these guys since the queen mary series?
I remember when they used to play the host game years ago in their house. Cool to see it come back
really glad to see that they are brining back there midnight games from years ago that they would prank each other with

27:30 didn't see her pick up the flashlight 🤔
Did anyone see the shadow that ran past them
Welcome to 2024 and who gives a shit who is from tik  happy new year
cool vid
I have a request for a video i would really love if you guys went to an old residential school i have always wanted to know what the kids would say and i know that there would be a LOT of energy there and lots of activity. Love you guys and your video btw ❤❤
30:53 fnaf again
The fact the they were literally 30 minutes away from where I literally live…
I'd go with Sam and Colby
@mrbeast definitely needs to be in avideo with yall
To be honest me and my friends have snuck in to our school gym the original one that literally light in fire back in the day and ever since that night we have believed and ghosted hunted there again and we have been want to go to some of the sam and colby spots so pretty much there our inspiration
We live in Alton and it's a creepy town but i love it! I've had my own experiences at mineral springs and that place is 1000% legitimately haunted! Thanks for coming to Alton and doing a video on one of the most famous places in our town!
OMG YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH FUSLIE AND VALKRAE YEAHHHHHHHHHH
Great video! Happy early birthday Colby! Love you guys!!!♥♥♥
No way you guys were literally 2 hours from where I was
nah thats crazy. my dads name is william and he is 7'1. wtf
The guide is lying out his ass man cmon 😂
Happy Birthday Colby! Hope you have a lovely day today and the rest of the year
I love you guys ❤❤❤❤
From filming vlogs in trap house to UNIVERSAL pictures sponsoring them, they came a long way and im happy that i was with them too😀
For a video idea there is this axe murder house in Vallisca iowa and it’s one of the nations most haunted house and I think it would be a cool video because there is so much cool history and crazy interesting stuff that happened there. There’s many crazy stories but you guys are the experts so why not anyone else do it but the pros!
I don't mean to talk crap about ur guys merch I love ur videos and I love ur content but why are ur shirts 100% cotton 😕
I think you guys edited a werewolf running in the backround when sam was talking about the well before colby took the cups out the plastic
Sam and Colby you guys are fucking amazing 🥲 make more videos me 🤗🤗❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Need to come to Australia and do the boggo road jail in Brisbane :D
happy early birthday colby
I mean sponsored by Universal?! Like oh m gee! 😲👍
11:43 Holy shit! Angel was right!
I live a few miles away and I've been in this pool. Something definitely tugged on my pocket when nobody was near me.
Thamks Warner bros For õõõ
You mean to tell me sam and colby were 40 minutes away from me and i could have met them at any point😂 scary
Just back there walking in circles... lol! 😂
i would mark and ethan go ghost hunting
Hang on they said it’s their first time investigating a haunted pool but weren’t they on the Queen Mary? That has a haunted pool iirc??
I HAVE BEEN ASKING 4 YEARS GRAB THE BOYS!!!
THE BOYS
At 16:00, probably a refection but I saw a shadow go by? But I'm not fully sure what it was though.
Damn, didnt know yall were gonna be that close by. woulda been cool to get a picture but fuck it, still cool regardless
8-BitRyan should really check yall out. his content is just horror games sometimes goofy games but mostly horror. I think he would have fun aswell
you guys have got to do a vid with the sturniolo triplets🙏🏻🙏🏻
Awesome video! You guys should have jaiden animations & the odd1sout!!!
1:09:48 HAPPY NEW YEARR!!! ITS 2024 NOW 💗💗💗💕
Not them looking behind them multiple times-
0:40 LMAOOOO
Omg I'm sorry but those girls were so annoying 😭 it was hard to watch
Them: its like the backroom (3 seconds later) guys wheres the door we went through earlier?       edit:just imagine the door just disappeared💀
Sam do a ghost hunt whit the boys (narrator,mully,Eddie,juicy,and Josh)
When the Alice Box said Limp and then Michael shortly after I almost wonder if that was not a name, Michael Lemp. The Lemp family was a beer brewing family in St. Louis and there were Lemps in the Illinois area too! I am curious if there is a Michael Lemp associated with the town or hotel.
sturniolo triplets + sam and colby AND the boys + sam and colby 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
i was in the car going to the store with my mom and saw a head in a window in an abandoned house and took a picture
It’s crazy how scared you can get from just watching a video and let me tell you I was shaking. Thank you Sam and Colby for always spooking the shit outta and as a horror fan it’s really appreciated🫂💕🔥
because why is it at 37:58 we see eyes  AFTER they had lite the match and going to the host room
HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY, COLBY AGAIN I CAN'T BELIEVE WE SHARE THE SAME BIRTHDAY I'LL BE 13 TOMORROW ❤ I HOPE YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       PLEASE MAKE IT TOP COMMENT SO HE CAN SEE THANK YOU SO MUCH!
Y'all should come out and investigate asylum49 out in Tooele UTAH it was an old hospital in 1873 constructed as a residence by Samuel F. Lee. It also has an old Cemetery next to it but now half of it is a hunted house Known as asylum49 and the Other half is a rest home ghost adventures have investigated 🔎 there 😊
Sam and Colby with The Boys would be epic.
This is so cool you guys where in my state this crazy seriously thanks for being awesome
Have they ever came to New Orleans?
Man I would love to see danny gonzalez on one of these videos.
Werid people....
do one of the hauntings with the sturniolos
This has been an amazing year!  As much as I'd love to see Kris and Celina more, I'd also want to see you guys partner with Shane and Ryan from Ghost Files for an investigation!
@sopiedossi
@samandcolby take me anywhere in the world I’ll do whatever sit where ghost hunt where ever I’ll do it die hard fan been watching you guys for years keep doing your thing and even if I don’t ever get invited I will still always support you guys and your videos
Bro can we talk about how Sam said not to turn around and at 41:51  Colby turned around but I’m guessing it’s you can’t turn your head around or something
Hold up universal picture can sponsor a YouTube video?or is it a joke
Bro who else saw a shadow @ 1600
Pleaseee go to the McPike Mansion in Alton, Illinois
If you’re looking for another place to investigate. Look into the Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville Alabama. I went there once. I’ve had scratches on my arm. And I’ve felt something pulling on my hair. And I’ve seen people who weren’t even there. Just a suggestion  Ps. There is a playground and there have been sightings of kids there laughing and playing. This happens in the day but mostly at night. If you two do end up going. Have fun :)
Happy early birthday colby! Your birth day is January 2nd but I telling you in January 1st
Every time Sam and Colby make their guests go alone: "I feel bad." Every time they have guests: "Yo, wanna go alone?"
I love The content that you guys have provided for everyand I believe that what you do is a really awesome thing. And watching you guys change overtime. But still kind of have that unique Sam and colby vibe.  I hope you guys keep up the work and continue though. Uncover mysteries and truth. About this plane the next and everything in between  I do think that if you have alcohol at any point visible in your shows, you should try and give a brief warning beforehand so that if there's any younger viewers. Our parents of younger viewers.  Could be notified? I had a time maybe even put a time to stamp or something this is just my opinion And in no way. Am I saying what's right or would be very appreciated? That way, I can share these videos with My daughter she As well as I am a huge Fan of the videos you guys make. It's just a Thought provoking idea hopefully I appreciate you guys nonetheless keep rocking
Please do collab with garret and andrew ❤
omg my name is Leslie to that is so cool
I think that y’all should be a Kalab with THE BOYS  they sometimes do investigations in scary places and I really think it would be a fun time
You guys never fail to create an enjoyable video to watch, Happy new year and happy Birthday Colby!!
Happy early birthday colby🎉❤
Hello, I know you guys will probably never see this but it is worth a shot. I was thinking that maybe when you guys hit 11million subscribers you guys can do Ed and Lorraine Warrens 28 day method. If you don't know what that is feel free to recherche about it. I think it would be a great idea , and your subscribers would love it, Sincerely Nevaeh.
The @sidemen
YOU GUYS SHOULD GO TO THE VAILE MANSION IN INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI
23:14   My dad died in a holiday inn
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBYYYYYYY ❤❤❤❤❤
Tell me why universal looks like the blackops 2 into to the zombies mode
Honestly, I'd love to see a Markiplier or Rhett and Link collab. I'm not sure if either can happen, but the comedy that would ensue with either guest(s) would be incredible!
please i need @ranboolive to do one of these with you
37:55 I see eyes…
i saw a shadow at about  53 mins or more but i could be wrong it was like somethng  walked past
HAPPY ERLY BRITHDAY COLBY
Cool Brother Brother 👏🏻😊🔥👍🫡🤗
Great video to end 2023! (Also happy early birthday, Colby!) Cannot wait to see the content brought to us in 2024!
As someone from Alton this is awesome hopefully yall come back  and check out more haunted spaces!
PLEASE I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH BUT PICK A FONT AND STICK TO IT
Do some scrying next time!
@CoryxKenshin should do this it would be so funny
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY (in aus)
Now images the boys and Sam and Colby together 🥹
I claim no negative energy from this video 🙏🏼
Absolutely love the videos! I hope you guys can post more videos this year instead of one every month or so. Go back to doing a video every Sunday!!!
Yooo what is that somthing is looking at them when they go back to the pool area when they start the game their doing and i like glowing eyes over the door...
Did anyone see a shadow move in that yellow sheet thing when they were talking about Pearl?
very good ep, i remember ghost adventures going to alton, il! you guys need to check out bachelors grove cemetery in south suburban CHICAGOOOOOOO (some al capone history and the "woman in white" figure
Ask Kai Cenat
I think Colby and Rae look very good together.
Ponga idioma español no entiendo nada lo que disen
hey just want to ask in the match part i counted the times that sam got a new match and it was four times ?
Happy New Year Sam & Colby 🎉🎉
I love how Colby just pans the screen to his crotch before starting everything. Timestamp: 1:45
16:01 did y’all see that shadow in the window😭
41:52 Colby turned around when the hour wasn’t done
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT I COULD HAVE MET SAM AND COLBY BUT DIDN'T BECAUSE I WAS TOO LAZY TO GET UP 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT I COULD HAVE MET SAM AND COLBY BUT DIDN'T BECAUSE I WAS TOO LAZY TO GET UP 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I would give anything to explore with Sam and Colby 😢
Jokes on you I was already scared of my pool 😅 (which is sad speaking I'm almost 16 yall)
Slogo
This is my favorite Sam and Colby video yet!! You guys are literally my favorite youtubers and literally make me so happy when you guys post. I been such a fan for a long time. Love you guys keep up the good work!!!
I would really love to see markiplier and mrbeast in one of your next videos
Here's some more history about Alton you might not be aware of, something many from Alton and the surrounding areas believe contribute to the paranormal activity within the town…Alton was the site of the first penitentiary for the state of Illinois. This penitentiary was later used during and after the Civil War by the Union army to house Confederate prisoners of war. Supposedly during this time many Southern soldiers endured poor treatment and starvation…when the union was through and the state closed down the penitentiary, the state didn't want to waste the prison and since Alton was growing quite rapidly at the time, many of the blocks from the penitentiary were repurposed into corner stones of new buildings…which some say, allowed for the spread of supernatural spirits all throughout the city!
Cobly, you looked behind you at 41:45 at the stairs
⚠️I SWEAR ON EARTH THAT I SAW EYES IN THE BACKROUND, WHEN SAM LIT THE MATCH ON THE LAST TRY, 37:58 THERE ARE EYES! I AM NOT KIDDING! I SWEAR ON MY LIFE⚠️
Mr beast🤷🏻‍♂️ you wont 2024
Did anyone else see the full body figure behind sams shoulder in the end when they are talking and ending the video
Well a markiplier collab would be totally insane!! I think he’d love it, and ofc be super funny!
y’all should bring laurenzside 🤷‍♀️
That spider was so big omg! (Greetings from Australia)
I miss Seth and Nate
Omg i love you so much like your the most amazing people ever im so glad your merch is in zummies im so excited for 2024 love you♡♡♡
Dan TDM PLZ
i don’t know but after seeing two good content creators. I wonder if sam and colby can get coryxkenish to be in one of their videos will be absolutely hilarious 🤞🏽
Colby: I have demons up all my holes Me: COLBY!? Sam: All your holes?🤨 Me: SAM!? WHAT??😭
I wish I could ever have a chance to go with Sam and Colby on an investigation. It would be so fun but at the same time terrifying. I very much enjoy these videos and I love you Sam and Colby!!!
i love watching you guys collab with other youtubers i watch who dont do paranormal stuff. this is so fun to watch and i wish i could experience this irl so i could be more of a believer. thank you for all the videos you make :)
Yo Sam and Colby, The boys were talking some shi bout y’all in their most recent horror video when they were checking out a haunted lighthouse
HOW DO WE GET LUDWIG ON HERE???
I hope yall have a wonderful day and love yalls videos 🖤🤍
You said put recommendations for ppl to make vids with right? What about the Sturniolo Triplets? That would be a cool video!
Omg I love Leslie.
i cant believe they went to my hometown while i was out of state 😭
37:58 those are eyes on the right side peeking around the corner
There’s so much goofiness in the videos I don’t even consider the ghost hunting videos. Could be dinner or my periods coming 🙄there’s just no class in females anymore. Guess the thought is the more scuzzy I am the more popular I’ll be! Uncouth all around. Done!!
Like this if Sam and Colby should collab with the boys
Pearls got that sass to her 😂❤
@samandcoldy HAPPY NEW YEARS  🥳 🎉 ✨️,I love your channel.If you have any new year resolutions you would want to share, I would like to know them 😃 😊
Does anyone notice when they show the phone when it says 12 o’clock it also says Saturday, November 11😂😂❤
❤
Very interesting and entertaining investigation!   If you're ever down to go investigate another hotel, I suggest the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles in California. I think with all the hauntings I've heard from it with the many tragic backstories, it's make a great video. Just a suggestion, your videos are always great.
If you guys took i show speerd im telling u it would blow up and it would be funny af
Can you pls pls pls do another video with Larry
Why did I think when the tour guide grabbed her ring finger and she said eww I thought she said it personally to him lol
No guys John W Gacy killed young men he would lure them letting them live at his house partying with them weed and booze then he would kill them burrying them under the house youngest was 17 if I remeber right…
it looked like the double estes method was working out great u guys shouldve let fuslie and colby go under together afterwards
Shane Dawson in a video I would love that!
Still a big fan of you guys ..followed ya since those crazy Vines lol... Colby is still adorable 😍 much luv 💟
So, before the video starts, you're gonna get everything The Watcher: Ghost Files DOESN'T 😆  Maybe peekers, some reeeeally clear voicebox stuff. The Oija board will do crazy stuff and you'll get poked or scratched. Maybe some whiskey will make you want to drink then you'll get poked... us regular folk without cameras never find anything 😢 🤣🤣🤣🤣 If it's corny, no sub...
Petition to get coryxkenshin to be in a video
my bday is jan 5th
I am not claiming any negative energy from this video ✝️
think these videos are getting worse.... so much talking not ghost hunting its all about the guest now.
We need 6k camera quality back
At 37:58  look carefully at the right door .... Looks like a pair of eyes😱
Wrong Im still Alive
At 41:50, doesn't that count as looking over your shoulder?
I’m not lying. At the end of the video when you guys took the picture. There’s a literal FACE behind Colby to the left of Colby’s face. It showed two dots like eyes another dot in the middle a bit down like a nose, and a frown like this:       🙁
I think that Brandon Farris should do this it would be so funny!
We need y'all with the boys please
Its just crazy that no one saw colby turn at 41:51
Happy early birthday Colby!!
when they were investigating the pool and talked act a girl name Cassie I'm like "hm isn't my na- OH GREAT HEAVENS"
Colbey do u do a bunch of reserch before going to places
“ A rat ran by like NEUMMMMMM “ Quotes from Colby
I know some people don’t believe in the paranormal, but I do, I believe there is more out there, more that we can’t even explain. But I hope everyone is doing well and keep up the great work Sam & Colby
Hey sam and colby! i was wondering if you could make a video without swearing but obviously paranormal stuff because im begging my parents for merch and if they would buy some for me they have to see you videos first. if you cant its ok ill show them some swearing videos.
You should bring Chelcie Lynn, AKA Trailer Trash Tammy!!
OMG ITS FINALLY OUTTTT
Yall were only like 45 mins away from me 😭
y’all big boys I would have sharted my pants
where's coryxkenshin at!?
My daughter’s birthday is January 5th!
Is it Michael from the crescent hotel!?
Day 6 of asking Sam and Colby to investigate Gettysburg battlefields
I love how at the end it’s just a bad ass cleansing montage. This is genuinely some amazing video editing.
Would you guys ever do St Ignitus hospital in Colfax Washington?
Kinda just want sam and colby to do like a history channel
I really want Sam and Colby to do an investigation with @Kelsi Davies
Xplor being in Zumies is crazy! I'm so hyped
You should take The Boys somewhere that would be amazing content right there
Y'all are one of my fav YouTubers I love y'all
Can we just appreciate the fact that they scored a sponsored video from Universal?!? So proud of you guys, excellent video!
Okay this episode is giving me a f****** headache can you guys just do your own investigation without getting girls and f****** noise sorry so annoyed by it I'm turning this one off😂 😊

It seems more like Colby’s estas was being controlled by Pearl and the husband was talking through Rae’s. It seems like in the beginning she (pearl) is trying to warn them, and then maybe in the middle they switch when Rae says “I need a doctor” or maybe it’s the husband mocking her? Just a thought, I’m not sure
I’d love to see @CdawgVA Go to Japan and get him and his friend @AbroadinJapan they would be so entertaining!!!!
I want you guys to bring the Sturniolo triplets with you guys on a ghost adventure
It said carols only cousin Harry. I Tina?
Happy new years
56:03 A rock went flying just over Fuslie's head. You can hear it hitting the ground and if you go frame by frame there's something in the air that is moving fast towards the ground which is shaped like a rock.
@nessabarrett you gotta go on one !! 😩🫶🏼
I would love to see you guys and the sturniolo triplets Collab!!❤❤
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAY COBY I HEARD JAN 2ND IS YOUR B DAYYYY IDK IF IT IS BUT HAPPY BIRTHDAY
love how when it said tina, Rae and Leslie didn't even think of their FRIEND TINA lol I wonder if it had something to do with her. maybe she has a cousin named carol or harry (PS only caps because that's what the alice box said, not to show any hate or aggression :) )
also how about infint the gamer just thinking
HOLY HELL, a universal picture sponsor?! congratulations you guys!!!! you’ve come so far 🫶🏼🥳 we’re proud of you!!!!
Take the boys
I wanna see ibp on a ghost hunt
@Insym time to go ghosthunting irl xD
Please take glam and gore or Kelsi Davies on an investigation. Glam and gore is a skeptic so it would be good, she's done a few ghost hunts before too
The fact that Sam and Colby don't like to bring up the Conjuring House and they did just to compare the well size of the Minerals Hotel's well.
shane and ryan from the watcher
of course its illinois tbh 😔😔🙏🏽‼‼
Celina and Kris PLEASEEEEE💖
i love how they were like- "whats his name?" colby: Mickey Sam: they dont know his name Colby: Oh... best part by far
Damn boys, Universal as a sponsor and your gear is in Zumiez, you guys are doing the damn thing!
Matpat should go and do a film theory episode❤

Im sorry but fuslie is so annoying…..
did anyone notice the movement in the window next to Leslie at about 16:00, it could have been anything but still weird to me
Sam and Colby, please for the love of god take Seth and Josh to Witches Forest
can i recommand twitch streamers? if so i recommand midnight_king_666 and FirieRyn they are small streamers but i know they will definitely come
idk why but i can't stand when the guests are sooo inexperienced in the paranormal that they end up just being scared the entire time. its not their fault but as a viewer i just really don't enjoy it. this video sadly was my least favorite you guys have put out :'(
We need Asian Jeff in one of these videos 😂😂😂
Sam and Colby can you make video whit Shubble she is so cool pleass! :D 😁👍
Can anyone imagine Ethan,mark,jack or like Dan and Phill 😂
37:57 are those... eyes in the door

You deserve respect, kindness and happiness. Please don’t attach to me or my loved and close ones.

I think that the people on the chairs werent really there. The figures was formed like the chairs. For examole the legs were the legs of the chair
The same day the movie came out is the same day as my B day
I had an experience with a candle and if this can get 1k likes I'll explain
My goodness! You got a sponsored by universal pictures!! Congrats!!

You should take Omar gosh in your videos 😊
I remember the last video of 2022 this year has gone so fast. Thank you so much for an amazing 2023 can't wait for more extraordinary content. Love you guys
god these guys are scam artists. I cant take anything they do seriously.

@JaskoYoutube

I'm not a dream stan, or frankly even a true fan, but it would be cool to get him in one of these videos with like MrBeast or something
You guys should go knight ferry ca

Happy bday colby!🎉
I can tell I have no self-preservation instincts when I hear the music 3 seconds in and decide "sure, I'll watch this in the dark at a quarter past midnight with my window open"
They should bring back Seth and the Sturniolo triplets idk how to spell there name but they should do them together also this video gave me chills
Plsss put imbrandonfarris in one of these

COLBY LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I might be crazy, but I swear I'm hearing something at 24:12 - 24:13 . Like a little "hi"
Next time you’re in Alton, go to the McPike mansion. Or go to Arcola, IL to the grave of the Chesterville witch! Love you guys!
HOLY SHIT YK SAM AND COLBY BE BIG NOW WHEN UNIVERSAL SPONSERING THEM
Bruh when they were doing the estes method and colby and rae under and sam and Leslie are just laughing and screaming
I literally went to the mall and saw your pictures posted on zoomies windows and I ran in there and embarrassed myself 😭
Sam and Colby! You guys NEED to do a video with THEBOYS. They even requested it!!!!!!
Please get Cory Kenshin and Dashie to collab with y’all PLEASEEEE
Hear me out Sam and Colby take on The Cecil hotel? With any guest.
Omg check @54:41 behind Sam's shoulder, it look like a big white face then when he pans back it's gone 😭
Sam and Coldy why don't you make a nexflix series of the congering house and all your other videos love the vids ❤❤❤ think about it

I'd love to see you with Twin Paranormal !
Hi Sam and Colby, I love yalls videos and I jus got yalls merchandise at zummizes
I would love to see Michael Reeves do this with a friend! 🤣 it would be so funny
Ok hear me out Capron Funk
@samandcolby u should do a vide with eddievr and his gang (the boys)
Do you still have cancer colbanious
Gii ok back to the conjuring house
ok during the dual estes method, did it seem to anyone else like Colby was channeling Pearl, and Rae was channeling Pearls husband? their answers lined up really well
Someone send this to Coryxkenshin I wanna see him on this ☹️🤜
I don’t claim any bad spirits or negative energy from this video may god protect me and anyone watching✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️
Would love to see a collab with you guys and @twinparanormal!
I would love to see you guys with @The Boys !
I think y’all should do an investigation with the Camboys they are super funny. i would love to see that collab
Me living in Illinois and never hearing of this place….time to take a little road trip
I would love to see you guys collab with Markiplier it would be so funny 😂
And to think y’all was so close to one of the most haunted towns of all of Illinois. There has been a few books written about it and all the locations there. It’s a small town called Decatur.
collab with the boys
Omg this video came out on my birthday 12/30😮
are those not eyes at 37:58? in the corner or am i tripping
You should definitely bring coryxkenshin on one adventure that would be LIT 🔥
Can you see if you can get unspeakable james and gabe in a video plezz and thank you.
you know what be hella funny if you guys featured dude perfect (the whole group). They have such a great chanel and are funny and are prepared to try anything. It would be very funny and spooky at the same time.  It would be one of the first times you guys brought more people to use more equiptment and they could also investigate more. I recomend a bigger place. I would totally pay to watch that video. Bonus they would also expand your chanel and veiw numbers. I love yall so much  you guys are super funny and sweet and really inpiring to people to face their fears. Love you so much ;)
22:35 sorry y’all im putting this to save my spot😀😀
32:18 I’m sorry did anyone else see that right above his head? If you zoom in it looks like a figure just like the guide described??
Is it just me or are the pictures they show us more scarier than the video
When they use the emf reader so the energy from the camera or the torch  can set it of so they need to keep it away
Hi Sam and Colby Ive been seeing figures in my room and been hearing noises what should I do keep up the good work
I know this might sound crazy, but another small town in Illinois I think is haunted. Seneca, Illinois. It’s my hometown and I’ve had a couple crazy experiences. I was in 4th grade during winter walking down to the bus in the dark, freezing. I more lived in the country and it was a 10min walk down. I was getting down to where the weeds in my yard started when i was met with a tall figure. It was in a suit that was more of a copper or rust color. No face and pale skin. Almost like i guess a slender man figure. I just got that rush of adrenaline as i see it basically almost crawling towards me. I immediately was crying and ran inside. I have NEVER ran so fast in my life. Also, my brother who is 2 years older was supposed to walk with me, but he had forgot to charge his computer so he was getting a ride to school. End result: I never walked down to the bus stop alone. I used to not be scared walking down to the bus in he dark during winter. From that moment i have always been terrified. And if you ever visit Seneca, Illinois.. i want to see you guys visit the original location of the ROONEY’s bar
The boys w
Sam and colby please ghost hunt at the belvedere mansion.
Dude, I don't know if I was the only one. But.... seems to me that after the Estes Investigation Pearl mentioned that George actually cursed them. That's so sad and heartbreaking. The fact that George went to far to actually keep them in that loop of suffering just for revenge on her (perhaps). That's what I have hint about that.
you guys should take laurenzside
In 2024 we need another Sam and Colby faze rug collab
After 55:22 was that a second "hey" and if so was that one of them?
13:39 🤣🤣🤣
I would really like to see Kai cenat in one of you guy’s video I feel like it would b a great opportunity for you guys and him he’ll maybe even the whole amp crew
You guys should do an investigation with the sturnilo Brothers, they are triplets and fun af
Please take Zane and Heath !
I am and will not claim any negative energy from watching this video nor from watching other videos from this channel and I do not want any of this spreading to any of my loved ones or myself throughout watching this so If I made any unnecessary glances throughout the video I am sorry for that. You deserve respect, kindness and happiness. Please don’t attach to me or my loved and close ones.
#mrbeast😂
Claim no negative enegry Amen
You should take the boys to the stanly hotel
Y'all should invite Markiplier :3
Do a vid w/ Loey Lane!
You said November it’s January…
Coryxkenshein should go on this
hey sam and colby been watching you guys since 2018 i turn 18 on January 4th and if i could recommend you something to explore i would suggest you both look into The Papin Sisters to give u some information Christine and Lea Papin worked as domestic servants for a retired lawyer, René Lancelin, his wife, Léonie, and their grown daughter, Geneviève. The Lancelins lived in a beautiful two-story townhouse on No. 6 rue Bruyère in the city of Le Mans. Christine Papin (8 March 1905 – 18 May 1937) and Léa Papin (15 September 1911 – 24 July 2001) were two French sisters who, as live-in maids, were convicted of murdering their employer's wife and daughter in Le Mans on February 2, 1933.   - p.s keep up the amazing work and wish you both luck
You guys should collaborate with the boys eddie mully joshdub narrator
Playing a drinking game with the spirits 😂
You guys have to collaborate with the boys eddie mully joshdub narrator
I think they should collab with @kelsiidaviess she’s a real medium and I think they’d be shocked with what she can do just like Amanda
Happy birthday colby!
IDEA: Start having the camera that can pick up the figures with the Xbox connect aimed at whoever is under for the ESTES Method for the entire session. See if any spirits stand around the person they are channeling through??
ILLINOIS I LIVE THERE
The fact I only live 21 minutes away from the hotel is insane plus I pretty much grew up in Alton since I visited it so much 🤣
Please collab with Ireland Boys Productions 🤗 Y’all’s videos are amazing 🫶🏻
@corykenshin it would be so funny to see him with y’all and investigate some spooky stuff
Scary fact demons and angels are every where even demons
🎉🎉im mowing yo amerika baby🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I feel like it would be too much to ask of they could do a video w K-pop idols but that would probably be very hard. Maybe someone like Eric Naam or people in the community.
At 16:01 a shadow walks in the window
I would actually love to see Sam and Colby play Phasmophobia, especially in vr together
It’s funny how lou is Leslie’s comfort ghost 😂😂😂
HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!
I live near red boiling springs which is a haunted part of Tennessee and there is hotel there called the Thomas House Hotel, you guys should make a video on it. I’ve been there before and it’s pretty scary, I have watched y’all for a long time and I love your videos especially when you guys come to Tennessee like the bell witch cave video. Y’all should definitely check out the Thomas Hotel tho.
UCrXzMVbjcaVvVtihxNpBvMQ chek em out

I would LOVE the opportunity to come do my first ever ghost hunting with you both! My best friend and I have been watching a while and I just know it would be a fun time to spook us!
Yall should team up with laurenzside to do a video i would definitely watch it❤
You need to do a ghost hunt with the sturniolo triplets, that would be so awesome
You guys should invite the Ha sisters they're YouTubers who mostly just do funny content, but they have gone to a couple of places and they still don't believe in spirits
the memories! I remember you doing this game in the trap house!
1:03:00 - “he stole it” 16:12 - “i want the ring”
4:27 literally bloodborne, thats crazy, the healing church has sorta already happened
Two loser kids trying to be famous.
My name is leslie too
Do a scary video with oompaville and call me Chris
Valkyrea " I have never been to a place where so many people died" has she never been to a hospital
You should go to the Cecil hotel
@mattscharff
i was sooo upset when i found out you guys were in alton because it’s literally 20 minutes away from me & i didn’t know until after you left 😢
Happy new year
🐪
About a year ago my mom took me and my cousin to the stores outside of the hotel and me and my cousin said that we had to use the bathroom and we wandered into the mineral pool room and ball room and saw crazy unexplainable things
Ok so my name is Leslie and I've never met someone with the same name so anytime i hear my name in a video it makes me so happy
I want more of Rae and Leslie in your investigations😭
what if beelzebub is the one in the woods and Abigail was secretly telling you about it
If you turn up the volume all the way and listen closely you hear like in inhale 55:42
LaurenZSide would love this
6:01 wtf was that
i have a bad habit of watching Sam and Colby at night and this is my first time watching them in the evening😶
I think u should take kris and celina and HAPPY NEW YEAR SAM AND COLBY!!!❤❤❤❤
I would love to go to a hunted place with you Sam and Colby.
who else remembers sam doing that exact ritual in the trap house
Y’all never fail to act like npc
Colby said “he took it” the wife was saying how he took the RING
Take me on a ghost hunt with Kris and Celina and you guys ❤ I’m a medium and an empathetic as well. I have some STORIES and I live in the same town as the house I fled from due to paranormal happenings and my father being possessed
I want you guys to ghost hunt with Midwest Ghost Hunter so badly. His videos are AMAZING. I need someone to be honest if it’s real or not 😂😂😂

In the window
At 16:00 there is a shadow

They were in a pool and when it said Michael I thought of Michael pfelps XD
44:04 bro i don’t know if that’s Colby or Willam
that would be so awesome to go do that with you guys sometime
I love how through the hosting game sams like whatever you do don't turn around...and then he causually keeps turning round the whole hour like he's asking to get possessed...
Sam, Colby the whole time I was watching the video it was fine, but when you started the party game, my video kept pausing and I was not touching my phone, I never had these problems before and they always paused after Sam says something like what.?
I wanna see u n @KelsiDavis collab 😁that would make my year
Would love to go on a haunted adventure with you guys! What a lifetime opportunity that would be
her what
more rae and leslie!!!
Nobody gonna talk about how colby turned around..😂 41:51 41:52
Hi Sam and Colby! Not sure if you would see this but across the street from me there is a forest with broken I guess buildings? And I’m not sure if it’s haunted but it would be fun to see you guys explore there!
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening our side of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may have everyone give you the upmost respect! May you rest in peace.
Omg guys! PLEASE TAKE THE BOYS WITH YOU NEXT! THEYVE BEEN TO CLOWN HOTEL AND LIGHT HOUSE AND CONJURING LIKE YOU GUYS
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COLBY HOPE YOU HAVE A AWESOME BIRTHDAY TOMMOROW!!
I don’t think fuslie should’ve been touching Rae during Estes
I'm new to this channel and to  Slam and Opie but I like their content so far!
the way in which i live extremely close to alton AND my grandpa was buried there is making me cry
@dazgames
40:52
can you guys come to my birthday party?
Do an investigation with @twinparanormal you are my two favorite channels. It would be awesome ❤
I LIVE SO CLOSE TO ILLINOIS, there is a place in downtown Richmond, VA, that you should check out. I have been there once, and lemme say, you can see a bunch of weird things. It’s the perfect place, with haunted railroad tracks, haunted hotels, haunted mines, ( if ur lucky you can hear people who used to work there.) , and overall just a scary place to check out!
You should definitely collab with The Boys and Cold Ones! 😂
Can I please get a phone call  I followed you and subscribe your  videos
Do it with Joe Rogan and Jamie at the comedy mothership!!!!!!
TWIN PARANORMAL!!! THEYVE TRIED TO HIT YOU UP
What was in the window at 16:00 like a shadow moved was that a car but I thought they were on the top floor
You guys are just amazing you should be one of those guys that have like a tv show and investigate haunted places and hear noises and do experiments like the estes method the spirit box and having other people and friends go with you to those places   I hope you get to 20M subscribers before 2025
I live in Alton where this hotel is and have toured it with Dave. it is truly fascinating and they didn’t even talk about all the spirits! If you ever tour take it with just Dave and not him and his wife (his words) because she doesn’t let him mess with the ghosts and yell at them

Loved the video!! Happy new year guys!🎉 It would be so frigging awesome if you guys would do a video with Markiplier
@smi77y or @grizzy
You guys should go to another haunted pool specifically the rave in milwaukee, wi 👀
U guys r literally so close to me but also so far🤣🤯🤯🤯🤯 there's a lot of ghost stuff around here u guys should check out the history 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
15:58 there was something in the window
48:58 😂😂😂
Hey Sam and Colby! I think it would be cool if you took D’Adrian harding or larry and Kris and Celina. I love y’all’s channel so much me and my sister get so excited when we see y’all have posted! 🫶🏻🤍
I feel like all the 2024 vids will talk about how everything's together through the water bc the 2 last videos gets bad spirits by the water
37:58 replay it and look around
1:06:05 there were 2 glowing eyes in the background
did she just said her vibrator just went on..
Happy news years you guys! If possible do a video with the boys on YouTube they have been wanting to do a video with you guys but overall you guys are awesome and hope you have an amazing 2024! ❤thank you guys so much for giving us amazing content! ♥️
Sam and Colby can you please come back to Australia and investigate places like the princess theatre. Also love the videos.
You should bring Kris, Celina and stars
I repeat. TANA MONGEAU!!
You guys should take Brad Mondo on a ghost hunt and Charlotte Dobre too
i feel like fgteev would just be goofy and mess around in a haunted place so @fgteev
YALL SEE THE EYEBALLS 37:54
Happy early birthday Colby🎉❤
:0 IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THEM TO POST A VIDEO ABOUT THIS
So that magic mineral water was like fountain of youth?
Can you take Brent Rivera and Lexi Rivera. If they say no then can take MrBeast and Chandler? I love you guys so much you inspire me to make my own YouTube channel but I don’t have a camera so I’m saving up to buy one. I really want to be like you guys, you guys are the best YouTubers ever! ❤
37:57 there’s something with glowing eye in the doorway
We need you guys to take Caylus/Infinite on an adventure! Great video guys!❤
MARKIPLER!!!
I say you guys do a paranoral investigation at the Winchester house again with Ghost Adventures Crew. I feel you guys would get so much more Evidance and More information About Sarah Winchester and her past life. You guys already solved one clue Why nkt try and find another to discover..? I feel this would be absolutely life changing in history❤ I love ur videos and have always been a huge fan of ur Chanel. I have always been a believer in the Paranormal but u made my beliefs even stronger from the week if the conjuring. ❤ thank you so much for all you do.
Did anyone SEE the EYES in the corner when Colby walked to turn around
I'm a big fan
It'd be cool if they went ghost hunting with subscribers 🤩
Watching Sam and Colby's video at the beginning of the year makes the whole year more amazing!
you guys should try to come up to wyoming to a small town called rawlins. it has the old wyoming state penitentiary that is known for alot of activity. the ghost adventure crew filmed there awhile back and got some good footage. definitely a cool place worth checking out.
MARKIPLIER OR DANTDM- orrrr LDshadowlady-
Guys, I feel like there was something different about Colby it was a different vibe than usual!
"My vibrator is off." - Rae
Not the first haunted pool ever. Queen Mary 2017(I think) was 55:09
15:59 pay attention to the window in the background
I’m only 6 hours from that hotel at the moment 😂
I don’t claim any negative spirits while watching Sam and Colby’s videos
I want to go on a haunt with you
People don't realize that being at the hospital is being in a place where MANY have died 😅
I rememer going to the Haunted Museum and as soon as I walked in the computer short circuted. I was told it was due to my spiritual energy and the co-owner, a psychic medium, laughed it off with me. Cool place, wish I had more time to explore the town. On another note, it's definitely something to see some of my favorite YouTubers explore a place I have explored before! I remember getting crystals at that shop, and just exploring the town and asking about the history behind things. Super cool, wish I could explore there again.
YALL WERE IN MY STATEEE I WISH I COULD OF SAW YALL
You should bring the boys out on a hunt
next time you go to a haunted place again and you want to challenge the other you guys should make them play musical chairs alone!! its a rly spooky game google it of you dont know  what it is
Happy early birthday Colby
YOU GUYS NEED TO GO GHOST HUNTING WITH THE BOYS
PLEASE bring sinjin drowning with you guys
I loved this video! Amazing guys and Leslie and Rae were so brave for going alone like tf. I can’t lie I kinda wanna see Sam and colby invite like Grizzy, Puffer, Pezzy, Droid, or just like anyone from that group I think it might be kinda funny to watch them together 😂😂
I seen a black figure go bye the bar I think, but whenever y’all were talking about Charlie, I think his name
😂😂 same is like every white guy hears a noise says hello 😂😂
get kai cenat on this fr
You guys should investigate the George Eastman museum in Rochester New York it’s said that Eastman haunts the property himself I think it might be very fun!
You guys should check out the history of the Maribel Caves Hotel in Wisconsin. The background is very similar to that of the Alton mineral hotel. The building (or what’s left of it)is made of limestone and the mineral spring water was pumped into the hotel and bottled in the building next to it. Wealthy ppl went there for healing as well, and Al Capone would stay in the hotel and hide alcohol in the caves right next to the hotel. It is also believed to be haunted, hence why it’s nicknamed “Hotel Hell”
Am I the only one that sees a shadow looking thing  at the 16:02 mark?
at 47:06 that looks like the queen mary ship..
COLBYS BDAY IS TOMMORROW🎉🥳!!!!
Take doctor mike
Doctor mike
Did anyone else when they were worried about the matches did anyone else see the glowing eyes in the door way like 2 pairs of eyes?was I the only one??
Do you remember the time when you went to that abandoned asylum with the Ireland boys? Remember that god-awful girl scream? Well, I was watching Ray Williams Johnson, and one of his videos had you two and the ireland boys in it. There was a teacher she was pregnant and her boyfriend took her to a field and when she wasn't looking he shot her. But the most concerning thing I heard while I was watching that was they were 35 miles away from your location.
Did yall see the shadow ran at window at 33:48
alton locals rise up😁
I do not claim any negative energy, I pray for all those whom have passed on and grant you my utmost respect ❤❤
You guys need to have the Sturniolo Triplets in a video
on 6:32 you can hear someone say (Hello)

In the pool where they sId they felt short or breath and sick and heavy those are symptoms of drowning I once almost  drowned while in a lake while in sea cadets canoeing and I felt sick, short of breath, heavy and tired.

Lowkey you guys should collaborate with, the boys
Is anyone else confused? Maybe it's because I don't know much about Leslie and Rae but why are there 5 phones when there are 4 people?
When he said “he stole it” was he talking about when he took the wedding ring back??
im sorry is no one gonna talk abt how colby cut the video by going straight to his pants?- 1:47 again no hate or anything i just found it funny 😂
AHHH BEST COLLAB 😭😭 been watching the both of them for years
Continue do more vids about the conjuring plzzzzz
@doitwithdan
i just wonder how people find out not to look over your shoulder during the party thing
Do a colab with the boys
Did anyone else notice the shaddow in the window at 16:02? Freaked me the hell out 😅
YALL GOT MOVIE COMPANIES SPONSORING YOU NOW?!!!
Maybe you did it wrong, and Archangel Micheal came in and protected you. That is why nothing happened.
You should come to my school you were so close and meet me and my friends we at huge fans of you i really hope i get to meet you one day.
you should take Mattie Westbrouk and Carter Kench on trips
oh-my-godness I LOVE THIS VIDEO SO MUCH! <3
I got a feeling that someone was trying to say "hi" around when you were Open the liquor, I thought I heard something 23:01
No one cares get off the internet
sam and colby colab with quackity wheeenn?
Ppl who live in IL 👇
Happy new year friends.
You should come to Logan Utah to the saint Anne's nunnery. I've explored there and I could feel something behind me on the stairs. Love you guys! ❤
You should try ghost hunting in Denmark (it's really scary😢)
YALL SHOULD DO AN AVENTURE WITH THE BOYS
YALL SHOULD DO AN AVENTURE WITH THE BOYS
26:30 nice
Y’all should definitely go on a video with the old trap house members
You should explore an abandoned Rutland prison camp
I LOVE U SAM AND COLBY
I wanna see the most random people go this year... Cody ko, Charlie, Kurtis.. idk it just sounds funny
was that beer that they were drinking?
When they said a seven foot tall shadow figure named William I thought of Wilbur soot💀
when colby and rae where doing the estste method rae said “will” and down by the pool colby talked about the tall shadow figure called william (will for short?) right before it sam said “are you trapped here”
41:51 he looked back...
Idk. Seems like this would be fun. Don't think I would be scared.
This is video is super cool but, YOU GOT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS TO SPONSER?! I mean, it could be common, idk, but this is the first video I have seen where they sponsor.
fulse: we are having coversatons with them right now. the spirt: on god
just moved to alton, I live real close to the river and it is definitely scary lol.
Your videos are always so fun and I love Leslie and Rae and the little video game animations 🤭❤️
Alright, this is something I have been waiting for because if you fuse my two favorite people on the internet...It's just gonna be the best. I have asked before and I'll ask again. PLEASE DO A COLLAB WITH THE BOYS!!! You guys would all make a great team. Trust me, I've seen their paranormal content and they are 100% people that would be PERFECT to collab with. I know you most likely will not see my comment, but if you do, please consider this idea. I know that it would be way more people than usual but trust me, it will be worth it.
If Sam and Colby likes this comment I’ll buy 2 merch
i loved the video! this group was sooo funny lmfao i think it would be so sick to take tarayummy out ghost hunting lolllll if she would even be up to it and vereena!! they could go together it would be cute and funny
We got her a little Bebe and marbles- Colby Brock
Can you do Karl and  sapnap
I think your tour guide was being cap in the pool area
Sam and Colby should go to the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel in Canada and here is the info about the hotel. At the hotel there is a bride that died at the hotel. she is usually spotted on the hotels marble staircase that she supposedly was going down or up to the wedding she was supposed to get married at and died at by her dress getting caught on or set on fire there is no way of knowing. She also seen in the ballroom dancing where she was supposed to get married at but never did. There is also Bellman named Sam McCauley who died later on from supposedly natural causes but came back to haunt the hotel. One of the haunted rooms in the hotel has had a family murdered and ever since there death people have reported waking up screaming and seeing bloody handprints on the mirror and the handprints have been reported to disappear before hotel staff could arrive to clean it up.
Happy early birthday colby
my brothers name is alton so anytime they said the city name it caught me so off gaurd😭
i dont know if its just me or 21:15 minuets into the video is somone just watching them in the background
I very rarely do rituals now when I go ghost hunting because it's just so scary, if you fuck something like that up, you could end up with a demon following you for the rest of your life (also you two specifically, sam and colby, inspired me to ghost hunt every once in a while for fun).
🎉 Happy New Year🎉
happy new year yall :)
I sort of feel like Rae(?) was in George’s chair and was speaking for him and Colby was speaking for Pearl in the other chair. I have nothing to back this up with but it’s just a feeling I’m getting

Y’all should come investigate the Ritz theater in Shawnee Oklahoma it’s a old abandoned stage theater and an woman fell to her death from of the railings and some say a man I have been in there once because I acted in a play as a kid and backstage I could hear some spooky things and felt weird energy back there alone. Just google it I’m sure you’ll find it interesting it’s in my hometown it’s all we hear about and there’s even and abandoned hotel that was once a casino and is where a person jumped from the window of on the top floors but you can also hold that it’s right next to the ritz theater and it’s the first thing that pops up in haunted Shawnee on google lol
Plz get in contact with courtreezy
I remember watching CourageJD’s stream when he was playing with Valkyrae, and they were talking about how she was going with you guys to do this video and I’ve been patiently waiting ever since. Didn’t realize y’all were only 40 minutes away!
could y'all possibly come to Norway and investigate som old churches? there is said to in the middle of the night you can hear like weeding music, parties and much talking. also said that u can hear kids screaming and running around and lights that flickering or just swinging. and off much more but I can't remember what else. this is just an idea :) love your videos!! I literally shitted my pants by every noise
Sam and colby can u do please do more vampire or dracula vedios
I want to see them come to the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City, MO! I went there for a field trip for school but it was for the history. They have a paranormal tour as well. The whole time I was there it felt like there was something following us, my back was hurting really bad, and the feeling of being watched while passing some of the cells was pretty nerve wracking. And when I got home later that day I heard 3 knocks on my window and my door shut on its own. My heart suffered so much that day😭
sam and colby should play phasmaphobia
Rae is old
Sam: "and there's not a seven ft figure man😂😅"  Colby: "NaMed William 🍉🍦🍭🍭🍦🍎🎼

Happy birthday colby 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I live near Alton!!!
Dear god I do not claim any negative energy from watching this amen.
Can you do a haunted video with ''TheBoys''
Great Video you guys!!!!! If you need a Place to get spooked by the afterlife,  Checkout Clarke county Downtown Berryville in VA. In this town during the civil war many people died in the fields and most of the towns houses were made into makeshift hospitals to help with the war. Berryville also has the Shenandoah river flowing through and Many people have drowned in the river, also a plane crashed at Mount weather in blue mount 1974, all 92 people that were on the plane died in this incident. The Town was bulit in 1775 and incorparated in 1898, The town was called Battletown before it got changed into berryville later on. who knows what happed then. If you ever want to check out the town we all will be happy to see you guys! And if you are going to bring others we would love them as well, We love Kris and Celina!  so with all that said i hope you keep our town in mind, Have a happy new year Sam and Colby!😁
hey sam and colby idk if u will see this but i think u should go to uk in london to see peter ad vincula where anne boleyn haunts there has been a couple of sightings of her roaming around the castle but i think u should go because she is very well known

I am SOOOO happy that things are going so well for you! Look at you guys, getting sponsored by Universal!!!! That’s awesome! You guys are great and I’ve believed in you from the first time I watched your video, and then binged all the other videos! You guys definitely deserve the recognition you’re now getting. Of course, that’s coming from a 2, so…😉😆😝😂
Sam and colby you should investigate the ozone disco it’s a fire killed 100 pulse people  Please consider doing this
"why do the ghost go to the bar? To catch the boos"😂

DAAAAMN, WISH I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE ONLY GOING TO BE 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM ME. I SURE WOULD'VE CAME TO SAY HI. Alton is the greatest place for haunts. You guys should check out the haunted underground train tunnel. We go on the haunted Alton tour every year but they wouldn't let us go downstairs, so I am very excited to see it through your videos, Thank You Sam & Colby
YALL HAD TO GO TO MY CITY
This was truly amazing and with rae and leslie made it even more exciting! It was great seeing them both. To point out for your mistakes on the game, I believe that after counting out loud 1-10 from the 1st match, if it doesn't light (as in your situation) you aren't supposed to count again, simply strike the 2nd match and then badabadabada. :)) Correct me if I'm wrong
Yall need to have brittany broski

I am and will not claim any negative energy from watching this video nor from watching other videos from this channel and I don't want any of this spreading to any of my love ones or myself throughout watching this video and thank you so much for listening to our side of the story. If I made unnecessary glances throughout the video I am sorry for that. You derserve respect, kindness, and happiness. Please don't attach to me, or my loved and close ones.

You guys really need to team up with the sturniolo triplets,it would be super funny and so cool to watch😊
It’s the second of Jan so happy birthday Colby 🎉🎉🎉
Omg this must been a crazy investigation! I saw it on my fyp where Colby almost passed out abt the stairs lol! Love you guys 🫵🏻🤍✨
can you guys explore my house. crazy unexplainable events happen here and it's nuts. most of it happens if your home alone with 2-3 people. but when I go to bed. there is a man with a top hat that watches me sleep. I talk to him sometimes
Yo , you guys use to be more serious about finding out information. Now it seems like a jokerfest half the time.
@markiplier is a MUST!!!
I love your videos ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Colby- 😃😟
"2024 is gonna be a lot crazier" OKAY THAT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE AFTER THE WEEK AT CONJURING😀

It would be awesome to visit @PewDiePie in Japan and go for a ghost hunt in Japan, Japanese ghosts are way more scarier

Partner up with the sturniolo triplets :)
I think you should have jack manifold with Eleanor Beale!
I would love to see you guys either investigate with Markiplier, Ethan Nestor or Garret Watts!
You guys should do a vid with the Sturniolo brothers next, they are really fun and probably an interesting thing to try out. I already recommended it and just waiting if they'll respond but that will be a cool vid to start 2024. Btw I love your guys vids and you guys make me feel so happy and safe ❤❤
Where can I find door merch in Manchester
Lanarae and kreek would be so much fun to watch doing haunting with you guys!!
Happy New Year
37:55
I have 2 recommendations for people to take on a scary adventure.  1. Uncle Roger 2. That assistant from the Ellen Show - before it got cancelled obviously. The one that would always go on the haunted house tours and hide behind everyone.
or joni gilbert
I am and will not claim any negative energy from watching this video nor from watching other videos from this channel and I do not want any of this spreading to any of my loved ones or myself throughout watching this series and thank you so much for listening to our side of the story❤ If I made any unnecessary glances thru the video I am sorry for that.

You know what would be the best collaboration? Sam and colby and twin paranormal!
Happy new year ❤❤❤❤
everything in this episode can either be explained by science or was a convincing lie
Sam always does these rituals 😂
How can I get a movie ticket 😅 , if I live in India,
Do you guys know what do I do . In my house there are 5 people me my siblings and my parents but in my room only there are always knocks I don’t know how I look out the window but nothing and it knocks I always feel like there is someone or something here I’m not scared of it is just creepy my friends and family hear it but nothing so I’m not the only one I just want it to stop or just know what it is do you guys know what can I do?
now you need Markiplier and Jacksepticeye, that would make a hilarious video.
Entertaining and fun. Thanks for another subbed vid update. Any plans for more 48+ hour investigations?? I suggest a week long mission at a specific destination to gather more paranormal evidence in succession over a longer period of days. Rooting for you both

Hello i would like to ask you if you will invite Kelsi Davies (sorry if the name is written wrong) she is a youtuber and she is a medium and she can see things or feel how people died, she also go to haunted places and investigate there so i thought it will be cool to have her there
That’s so weird u know the like all the wood things at like 14 mins in the video I saw the same in a dream but I normally forget dreams so that’s so weird
Get GeorgeNotFound, SapNap, and Dream to come do this
What a way to end the year. I would love to see Karl back, and maybe Dream and George for a future video this 2024. Anyway, I don't allow any negative energy or spirits to come around and follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this video.
Yo girl aint liking a small pipe
Not me watching this at within the 3am hour in a dark room🙃
Rae and Leslie casually making friends with spirits is something haha, they're sweet and friendly everyone feels comfortable with. Thank you for having the gworls, it's so fun and awesome ❤
we need one with the boyss!.. like micheal, toast, john, scarra or lud they ll be soo fun to watch
I remember when I was very little,my mom was knitting and she heard on my baby monitor “do you wanna play?”. She thought it was my sister so she checked and they were in there beds. I was in my room completely alone. I was very scared of her to the point I slept in my closet. Till I said she found me. She did not go away till the age of 5 I think. Moogi was her name. Just a little girl who wanted to play with me.
Congratulations to #2 trending 🎉
it’s so crazy that you keep saying the name of a place i know and have visited many times. it’s crazy you were so close to me!!!
They should have medium play the game

Hey Sam and Colby I've beed seeing your page for a long time now and I was wondering if you can do ghost hunting in my house because at least for the past 6-7 years I've been living here with my family and each house we move to our family see spirits around the house and we named them all the man in the black had the woman in the red dress and the haunted mirror the haunted mirror was my mom's childhood mirror that she saw spirits in and they spoke to her and told her her dead great grandad drags name which was blue anchor and in was wondering if you can check it out some day thanks and goodbye🤍

Sponsored by universal…
To be honest I think the guests weren’t the best choice. I get that it was their first time but also I believe that you guys could’ve gotten more information if you would’ve tried to be more calm. AGAIN I get that it’s probably scary and shocking and that People react different but it was really annoying at times.
WE LOVE VALKYRAE AND FUSLIE!! BEST GIRLS FUSRAEE

TAKE ME
Phasmophobia is my favorite game
U gys are so amazing and u gys are my favorite content creators ever ❤
I dont know what this is but at like 37:56/57 there are these glowing light things in the door way, in the right corner. It just looks like someone is peeking from around the corner. It could just be refelction os something but idk. Can someone confirm this?
OMG in the middle of Rae's rant about how not cool it is to throw rock at people... "Im cool with Lou" ~ Leslie HAHAHHAHA this just made my day
22:12 there is something running in between the two girls when sam says "that goes underneath this entire town"
COMMENTING ON THE FIRST DAY OF 2024!!! I LOVE YOU GUYS SO SO MUCH!!! I LOVE YOUR GHOST HUNTING VIDEOS!!!
So far... this is my first 2024 video that I love in the Sam and Colby youtube videos. Because in this... the couple (George and Pearl, although they have a sad backstory) still argued in the afterlife which made it more interesting and quite funny. Like... bruh... they are still arguing.  I hope their curse would end, because I do have the feeling that the husband stole something, that cause their marriage in shambles...
AHHH OMG I HAVE BEEN WATCNING THEM LATELY MY 4 FAVS
16:00 behind the window there is a shadow figure
I feel like we got nowhere with this “investigation”… just watching 2 people try to do ridiculous games, watch flashlights, and scare 2 girls with made up ideas.
Yalll should bring kai
Amazing video! Valkyrae and Fuslie's reactions added so much fun to the spooky vibes of America's most haunted town. Great balance of humor and chills, can't wait for more adventures!
i really like leslies vibe and additude
im watching this at 3:00 am and im so scared
@preston playz
i wish y'all would research who you partner with. Valkyrae is transphobic n it makes me second guess supporting you two/your channels.
i do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughtout watching this. Thank you for listening our side of the stories. Im sincerely sorry if i made any glances i shouldn’t have done and may have everyone give you the upmost respect.
Rae and Leslie are adorable,  nice collaboration ❤
Happy new years you guys!!!❤❤❤
Happy New Year’s everyone
HAPPY FROGGING NEW YEAR

The world could be such a wonderful place if only we would learn to let go of our anger, bitterness, division, and hatred. If we learned to love one another and to humbly serve one another, When God made humanity, he did so that all the people of this good earth, would love one another as brothers and sisters in Christ. We have so much potential to be a force for good in the world. All we need to do is let go of our pride and love the Lord and others with an open and willing heart. Jesus died on the cross as a free gift of salvation for us; it isn't based on self-righteousness. or based on our performance, it is only by God's great mercy and sacrifice when he died on the cross, when he took our punishment for our sins. The only thing that counts as righteousness is faith in Christ and what he has done for us. “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Rejecting God's mercy will only lead to our eternal suffering and damnation. Sin is like a disease that, if left untreated, will destroy us, like cancer. Sin must be dealt with. which is why Jesus took our punishment for us; all we need to do is repent for our sins and place our faith solely in him. “It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.” Luke 5:31-32  "Dear God, please forgive me of all my sins and wash me clean. I've chosen to trust in the finished work of your son, Jesus Christ. that when he suffered and died on the cross for my sins through his blood, they were washed away, lead, and guide me on the path you have chosen for my life; lead me away from anger and hatred; teach me to love and serve others as you've loved me."  Eternal suffering is horrifying; it is forever, and once dead, there is no escaping such a fate. That's why While we live, we need to turn to God for forgiveness. ''Anyone who says they do not sin is a liar, and there isn't truth within them.  Paraphrasing 1 John 1:8  ''But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  Matthew 5:28  You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God. don't you? Stop deceiving yourselves! Sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,  Corinthians 1:6-9  But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart (from our thoughts), and these things defile a man. (Make us sinful and worthy of judgment.) For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.  ''Anyone who uses divination (consulting with psychics or mediums) practices witchcraft (Wicca) or claims to be able to predict the future through signs and omens. (a false prophet) or a sorcerer (one who dabbles in voodoo, black magic, or any other occultic teaching) is guilty of sinning against God'' The punishment for dabbling in The occult often meant in ancient times that you'd be put to death or even burned at the stake because of Israel's rebellion against God as punishment for their occultic practices. They were invaded and conquered by the Babylonian Empire. Only suffering comes from the use of such practices—suffering in this life and eternal suffering in the next life.  Paraphrasing  Deuteronomy 18:10-12
I got merch ✧⁺⸜(●˙▾˙●)⸝⁺✧ʸᵃʸ
You guys should take Jenna Ortega bro
One paranormal expereince i had was a little after one of my cats died i made a little thing and put it on a tree that they were buried at and on a day there was no wind AT ALL it started moving as if a cat was playing with it. after that i sat at that tree for a few minuates and tapped at the toy trying to play with my cat and sometimes it worked. I still miss them but i will remember that forever. Now i was a kid so it might have been something else other than wind but yeah i though it was my cat so yeah  😁
Why am I watching this at midnight 😭
This video is sooo last year
why do i get the feeling that sam and colby just suck at lighting matches lol. that or their matches suck
Toast!!!!!
Would love to see you reach out to the Imp & Skiz Podcast. Would be so much fun to see them go on a hunt. They would get so into it.
Starting my 2024 with this amazing video
If some people were doing the 7 minutes of hell, and something bad happened like they scream or poltergeist activity, rock thrown at them, and possibly knocking them out, would you stop the 7 minutes or not do it?
hi happy new years
Time to get more of their game group to join Sam & Colby on these investigations!
Ghost: OH MY GOD! I HAVE TO TELL THEM I'M A FAN OF THEIR FRIEND, TINA I. AM. A. FAN. OF. TINA. Machine: I Machine: Tina Rae and Leslie: Tina? Is her name Tina? Like "I'm Tina" or like "I, Tina"? Ghost: Dammit, that's why I don't like these machines.
That poor woman! She did all she could to escape her abusive to still be abused by him in the after life!!

Anyone who thought that the fact that colby said bàbà you can like the common

Universal studios sponsoring you?!! Thats really big
I love colbys pose he should be a ghost model❤
15:59 there is a shadow running through the window. It does not look human. Please explain
the problem with those girls is that they can't be quiet. Sam and Colby are trying to hear what's going on so am I and the girls are just going crazy
Need  Kris, Celina and Amanda together in your videos in 2024 they bring this sort of calm energy it's fun and knowledgeable without being fussy  Would also like you both to use more of sls camera and keep the Estes going.
Happy new year Sam and Colby🖤
when you guys and the triplet colabinggggggggggggggg
Truth or Consequences New Mexico has hot springs known to treat polio as well as the old tingly hospital that is now a veterans home
Currently watching this 32 minutes into 2024!
For the “don’t look back” rule, I would have totally pushed a chair against the wall to sit in. That way, there would be nothing physically be behind me- except the wall- and I wouldn’t feel compelled to look over my shoulder 😅
australia?
I loveeee rae and leslie sm
During the video when they had the sls camera out the green chair on the screen the person had there legs crossed like a girl would do
Happy new year!! 2024!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Pls collab with kelsi
HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 😆😆
1 TRENDING 🎉
Idk if I’m just tired but I love Sam and Colby and today while watching this video it made me feel really tired and weak, this has never happened while watching any other vids
This place is actually super close to where I live! And I had no idea it existed!! Definetly gonna have to go check them out now!!
anyone else think rae saaid her vibrator was off? lol
Hey Sam and Colby! I'm unsure if you go to Australia at all but if you haven't already, you should most definitely come to Kapunda and check it out! I recently went on a ghost tour at the Kapunda hotel and town, the guide was a bit confusing but honestly I was scared during some parts. There's a part called the Hallway to Hell and some guy named Harold is there, apparently he isn't all that friendly and fond of people.
nice
Sam and Colby, u should bring Disguised Toast, Sykkuno and Scarra with u in one of your videos, they are my favourite trio, I will tag them and pls try to contact them to convince them to come with u guys ghost investigating
#mrbeast
I would love to see you travel to the UK and do some more collabs with some id the top paranormal YouTubers there: Ghost Theory and Iconjure for starters. My daughter got me into your videos when y’all first started many years ago now. Thanks for only getting better and better. Congrats on 11 million subs.
I wonder why people are afraid of equality
I love Sam and colby <3 sooo much like if yu agree
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening our side of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may have everyone give you the upmost respect!

Watch this from 16:05
@abnormalclub you need to do an investigation with sam and colby
Happy New Year Sam and Colby!!!
❤
Is no one gonna talk about the fact that Colby full on turned and looked over his shoulder at 41:52 when he wasn’t supposed to! 🤦🏻‍♀️🙄😂
Sam - "Including boxes flying 10 feet off the shelfs"  Me - "OMG those boxes and me playing horror games have something in common,we both fly 10 feet" 🤩
Oh and I think it would be cool if y’all came back to Kentucky Lexington I live here and there is an area by these train tracks behind my granny’s house which she’s live in for almost 20 years but anyways near the train tracks there used to be woods and I was always scared to walk them bc not only was there a jail up the street and a lot of them escaped there was caves a lake and I swear it it’s haunted bc when I did walk the woods there was always little kids shoes next to the lake next to the train tracks and I always felt followed til this day if I’m over my granny’s house I feel like there’s something there outside watching us
Im just happy that sam and colby know how to make me laugh or make me happy when im upset💝
HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎊🎈🎈🎊
16:00 to 16:02 something moved behind them
Colby at 39:04 had me dead 🤣

Idk if yall saw the TikTok with the two girls saying explore there house and where they live they say it hunted and I would love to watch the video but the girls TikTok goes on to talk about how they live in a hunted house which is ironically next to the Appalachian mountains and they go on to talk about the history about the mountains and the property’s next to the mountains they don’t want to talk about how their town is haunted and that would be cool to show y’all around because they know a little bit about the towns history and I think it will be a cool Sam and Colby video bc it the Appalachian mountains that history alone is spooky
Yo I’m really haunted by the shadow man and another demonic entity I would love to talk to you guys about it. I hear people walking around in my room at night. I hear scratching in my closet and it’s so scary and terrifying
oh nooo
casual flex 🤣
i just love colby's reaction at 24:45 , I keep replaying it cause its hilarious!

The fact they told them no to turn around, and then cobly turned around multiple times while they where doing the light circle thing
22:13 something ran across the scree with a pair of eyes 👀
We need to see Demolition Ranch collab
TBH 14:00 liek around there. Maybe the reason they're heavy and feel pain was because all the stairs they climbed? Well idk thats what i think
as a man that lives in alton illinois it was really cool to see that you guys had come i have my fair share of stories from growing up in alton and to my knowledge my town lives up to its name
"I saw a mouse " Mickey mouse just randomly runs away 😂😂😂
PLEASE DO ANOTHER TRUTH OR DRINKKKKK😊
@ishowspeed, grab him and go somewhere in the forest

Happy New Year's Eve guys sending love and peace for 2024 ❤
Happy new year!! 🎉
Umm it’s not November Sam and Colby
I know no one is gonna read this, but this kinda reminds me of jjk. The whole negative emotions thing all coming into one place making spirits and stuff like that and figures, reminds me of how jjk curses are made by humans negative emotions to the point curses manifest.
The midnight game was a good to see I remember watching sam doing those videos❤️❤️
Happy New Year 🗿🗿👏👏
bro hear me out but DanTDM to join in on an adventure..
https://youtube.com/shorts/iFuG2kP_Vv0?feature=share
i love how colby is so considerate about them, she said “i do feel i’ll” and he said “it’s ok do u wanna take a break?” i love sam and colby<3
Would LOVE to see you guys collab with Tyler Blanchard!!!
As someone who has been here from going to college nearby I can confirm it is 100% the most haunted town in America! If you ever go back stop in at Fast Eddie’s Bon Air!
BRETMAN ROCK FOR NEXT GHOST HUNTING PLEASE
Is it just me or when they use the SLS  an those to spirits it looks like there talking to each other because the line on top of the body is the head and neck and It looks like to moving around like talking to each other
You should do a video with the ha sisters (only if y’all want to)
Yall need to go the Paris catacombs I’ve been dying to see you guys go
Happy early birthday Colby :)
That light must be a guardian angel because I had this dream that i'm praying asking for God's help 'cause I was being attack by an evil spirit and after I ask for help a light blue aura started to appear helping me to escape from those evil spirits
Happy New Year!!!  Sam and Colby. Please collaborate with the twin paranormal. You would be awesome together.
Can we just talk about the sponsor thooooo!!! So proud of you boys and all the accomplishments you have made! Here's to a new year of more Sam & Colby!

You guys NEED to collab with Twin Paranormal!!!! That would be EPIC!!!
Alton Illinois rep 💪🏼
"Don't turn around"  Colby instantly turns around quickly  to show the girls what they shouldn't do.... that was the likely the fastest fail in the history of that game
Ive been waiting for a collar like this and once I saw it I could've not been happier. Love you guys! I hope you get sykkuno in one of your videos in 2024 that would be a comedy and horror movie into one video.

I actually live in Alton, it’s great to see a video about it, most the stuff I learned I had no idea about. I’m glad to know that more people know about the stuff that happens here
Water is powerful. That’s why natives pray over it.

I would love to see you both visit the Paris catacombs one day. I know it would be an incredible adventure and I am sure your fans would love to see it too. Thank you for being such an inspiration to me and many others.  Sincerely, A fan

Since you guys do scary videos y’all should have a podcast or something and just talk about your favorite horror movies, I’d watch/ listen to that just more Sam and Colby content
OH MY GOD IM SCREAMINGGG!!!! Sam and Colby investigated 10-15 minutes from me!!! I wish I couldve met them, im so sad i missed out :((. Alton is a good place but it is known to be very haunted. Love sam and colby, you guys are amazing!!
16:00 is it just me? that there's someone pass by leslie behind that window:"}
Y’all guys should callab with James Charles 💓 or Blesiv and Fabio or both Larray and Issa
I want you to caleb with the boys
Did the ghost say THE TINAS
Is it just me or just some of photos look like ai photos?? Not to hate, i love sam and colby but pictures look a little fishy tbh
Rae: “My vibrator is off.”  Me: “Your WHAT??”
Thank u guys saved me a lot of time ik I'm just 11 but I have gone through so much sh!t I hate my life I wanna k!ll myself but I can't do that to my family and friends
I have a daughter who loves you guys and when she seen the post she was like mom they are in alton and a side note we live close to alton lived in Betholto il and is into creepy stuff and watch you guys all the time
do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening our side of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may have everyone give you the upmost respect
They had the nerve to take a trip all the way to zumies while they were in the basement 😢😂
Sam and colbyyyyy!!! u should do a collab with the Sturniolo triplets!! orrrrrr The Boys!! <3 I would love to see it!!
Happy newyear
Most people seeing the flashlights turn on for the first time: "I don't like that. Wait- how?"  Rae: "That's sick!"  Rae and Leslie: "AWWWWW it's good energy they're happy!" I love them 😂
When the y where filiming the convo in the lobby/hallway thing I just lile "Samuel John Golbach stop scaring the poor girls"
Isn’t Michael an archangel? Like one of the highest archangel’s? So wouldn’t it make sense that it was like a guardian angel that pushed him out of the way!!! I might be over thinking it but it’s possible…
Ok
If you guys are ever in Ohio, which I’ve been to this place many times, there’s the Ceely Rose House and has an interesting story including the family that lived there.
Sam and Colby can you please do a video calling scary number❤
Whenever it says *listen* I can't hear anything but the background music😂
Sam and Colby you should collaborate with The Boys the act just as weird as you guys lol 😂(just and idea it would be fun)
I'd like to see either Ian&Anthony or Shayne&Damien (all 4 are from Smosh)/ Aron&Dan (Game Grumps/ Mouse&Connor (Iornmouse VTuber and CDawgVA)
You should ask Eddie VR!! Please bro 🙏
Yayayayaya a new videoooooo I live for this shit
Why I’m watching this at 3am on new years idk
Y'all need to take Caleb (oompavile) and kris Or those two with Celina
You can tell sam and colby are not gamers at all 😂 love these guys
Can you guys please get binks and takeaya to do one and p

What’s the name of the melody/outro in the end of the video? It sounds SO good, I need to know
Please please please bring Tana Mongeau on!!!!!
Come to Australia because me and mY friendies went for a walk and I just saw this big tall big figure next to a river and he disapeared after like 2 secondes
@eddievr
To many ads guys
Take me to your videos if you ever go to Australia
Thank you Sam and Colby because y’all have helped me through a lot I’ve been watching y’all since y’all started and y’all have always made me smile when I watch y’all and I’ve always wished I could meet y’all or go ghost hunting with y’all because I love y’all
Sam and Leslie’s reaction 😂
WHERE IS LILLY!!!!!!
TAKE THE BOYS GHOST HUNTING!!! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS TOO!!
YES FINALLY A NEW VIDEO YAYY!!!
anyone else remember when they used to do the hosting game with their old friends?? this was a throw back
You definitely need to collaborate with Beta Squad!!
yk who i wanna see on an adventure with y’all? ME! no but like fr me
Yall should do a video with the boys aka: Josh, Eddie, Mully, juicy, narrator
Get the Ireland boys on here and explore an abandoned place
Is it just me or should Sam and Colby collaborate with Ben of the week because I would watch that a million times
i love watching your video's you guy's should collab with the boy's
I know this is random but I got your murch😁😁
you should ghost hunt with airrack and his crew he’d be perfect ❤❤
Literally iloveyou guys and your videos 😭
You guys should collaborate with the boys (Josh, narrator, juicy, Eddie and mully)
Chills the whole time this was wild. I think y’all need to get more gamers on cause this was awesome.
“Yeah, idiots” Colby, you crack me up XDDDD
Love how Colby just casually looks behind him.
@BrightSunFilm Should do an investigation with you guys
If you’ve been with them since vine you can like my comment
I like these girls but I honestly don’t feel like they are compatible guests for Sam and Colby’s type of material. I just feel like they do not add to the experience in an entertaining or productive way because it’s too far out of their domain and they are obviously uncomfortable the entire time. I mean that it the nicest and most respectful way possible. My favorite ghost hunting guests that I think really elevate Sam and Colby’s videos are Celina and Kris. Best ghost hunting duos/team I’ve seen by far that makes me genuinely interested in paranormal investigating.
Btw happy (almost ) birthday Colby!!!🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
I would love to see Coryxkenshin do a video with the both of you!
I love Leslie's energy 😂
Serious question . . .   Have you guys ever asked a spirit to reveal itself and while waiting it screams in your ear and it scares the shit out of you?
😂 omg I have always wanted to this but haven't had time nor the money to
Yo Sam and Colby I would love y’all to Collab with twin paranormal that video would be insane
Happy Happy Everyone! May you all have a blessed Happy Happy as celebrate the arrival of 2024! Happy Happy to all and to all a Happy Happy
0:04, yeah Alton is in Southwestern Illinois, not Central - it's closer to Saint Louis, Missouri. I know because I live in Southeastern Illinois.
43:25 in to the video the chair moved idk if it was someone else because no one pointed it out in the video but the chair moved so yea 😌
I think you guys and the boys should do a video together
Sam and Colby can you guys collab with the boys (juicy Eddie narrator josh mully ) it would be so funny!🐢
Please for the love of all things spooky, please invite Aaron and Jo to do this with you guys 😂 the vibes would be immaculate 🤌
Bro you upload videos tooo late
It not your 1st haunted pool your 1st was Queen Mary.
When you uploaded this it was my birthday:) PS: HAVE A GREAT NEW YEARRRRRRRRRRR
BROOOOOO loved this one it was so intense and somewhat funny at times, it was amazing watching you guys and i am really looking forward to the next vid
You should take Celina and kris. Seth and nate and Amanda.

I like that theres still a water bottle hanging on one of thhe hook things in the slaughterhouse
Happy new year babes
I challenge you to go to myanmmer and surviv for one week in kale
I’m at 27:31 right now and I think Lou might not be Lou, it might be an evil spirit that wants to harm people and might have taken over causing a pause where the flashlight didn’t turn on or off because it made lou get out of the way or something and made you have a false sense of security saying it’s all good spirits, but there was the abusive husband and possibly more evil entities causing me to go down this path of thinking, love your videos, keep up the good work, and Happy New Year! 🎉❤❤❤
I would love to see a video with the Sturniolo triplets
HAPPY NEW YEAR THX FOR THE YEAR OF AMAZING VIDEOS  SEE YA NEW YEAR ❤
my friend and i noticed at 37:57 some eyes in the right  the doorway. ( or  something  Similar)
I wanna see Sam and Colby take Flamingo somewhere so badly I feel like it would be so chaotic and funny
You guys should do the Morris-Jumel Mansion it’s really haunted
me watching this video and then thinking back 6 years ago when Sam played the hosting game with the trap house members.
I wish Leslie did the Estes method too would have been interesting to see if she had a different experience with the method
5 phones ?
Colby,Sam I would hope you could take me to a ghost hunt
This wes posted on my birthday

William afton likes water????????
❤❤❤ I'm on my dad's account and I love you guys so much
@caseoh
Once again another amazing video guys, can’t wait to see what content you guys have for the new year, you guys should collab again with Wilbur,Tommy,Jack, Niki, Foolish & Karl & take they’re friends Charlie, Ranboo, Tubbo & Aimsey.
There is a old ghost town in the superstitious mountains in Arizona called goldfield and is supposably haunted by the ghosts of miners and I would love to you guys go there.
Not Colby looking behind him at 41:52 😳🥲
WHY ARE THE GHOSTS ALWAYS BREAK DANCING ON THAT UUUM... FIGURE FINDER CAMERA THINGY? LIKE THEY ARE BREAKING OUR THE FORTNITE DANCES! and the spirits totally like gender swapped mid Estes method

Ok ive been watching sam and colby for years now. I think its cool there still doing this haunted stuff. But im still on the side of not believing the afterlife. I would definitely bet $500 they couldnt get me to believe 😂😂😂
happy new years🎉

First of all, congratulations you guys!! Universal is HUGE! My partner and I get so much joy from watching your videos. Thank you for bringing so much spookiness and laughter into our worlds.

Do with Mr. Beast
How does youtube determine which of our subscriptions they're going to delete, why and how often does the deletion take place?  Is there a limit to how many subscriptions we have?  Sure seems like it.
not colby lookin behind him on the night vison cam.. at 41:52
5:48 I´m sorry but I laughed way too hard when that low quality image of a rock appeared 😭
you guys were only 2 hours away from me
Maybe Daz Black? He has his own paranormal investigation series, and I would really like to see a colab!
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH AND IT WOULD KIND OF BE MY DREAM IF YOU COMMENT ON MY THING but what happens if they run out of haunted places to explore
Why is NO ONE talking about Colby turning around in that hour they weren’t supposed to😭
#mrbeast
“Do you guys just recognize everything?”  Yall dont?! 😂😂😂 yall live under a rock or something?!
sam and colby i have  been watching your channel for 5 years now and im glad u still have the best content out there in my opinion
Im Tina 😂😮
I have oficially been subscribed to u guys for a year now I havet watched almost every video on ur Chanel kan u take Tubbo and Ranboo on a ghost hunt pls
37:56 is when I saw a par of eyes and i Wonder how they not see it but colby look at the direction of the eyes
sorry but colby definitely pretended to drink jack right from the bottle and its made me laugh this whole time
Very interesting🤔
Did y’all see around 37:00 -38:00 how there were eyes in the door when they turned around
Y’all should collaborate with ludwig
happy new yera
I used to enjoy watching you guys but you have got so bad in doing these videos I’m going to stop watching ,  all you do is talk and shout more than try and communicate with the dead. What a waste of time
Why did I yell "is that Matthew Lillard?!" When I first saw the guide 💀
16:00 window in yellow. Watch
AHHHHH:0
You're telling me you guys filmed 20min from my house and I didn't know! I see ghosts there all the time the banshee is no joke
HAPPY NEW YEAR BTW! 🎉🎉🎉
I love your videos so much and love seeing you bring new creators onto the channel!! I also love that you show the cleansing experience at the end of the video. I feel like it's really important for us viewers to see that too. Would even love for you to cleanse us (aka the camera) to send that good energy and cleanly vibe to us! Hope you guys can start doing that! Can't wait to see what else you guys do in 2024!!! Happy New Year!
Please bring back Seth and Nate 🙏🙏🙏
You need to bring Zane and Heath on one of your investigations. That would be so fun to watch
Kelsi Davies!!
Omgggg I just moved from Illinois to Texas now I'm sad because you guys we're in Illinois 🥲
HAPPY NEW YEARRRR
i live like 10 mins from Alton, i was borm there. You guys should go to the McPike mansion.
40:18 am I tweaking or did anyone else see a tall figure
Noticed that 1559 minutes look at the window and you’ll see something moving😮
Flamingo on your channel would be perfect
Did anyone else here a hello at 6:32
@caylus can he go? that would be AMAZING
I remember when y'all played the hosting game at the Trap House YEARS ago
Around  54:35 to 54: 40 you can hear a faint scream in the background
Are you both satanists?
I LIVE RIGHT NEXT TO THAT HOTEL
CallmeKevin should be on one of these hunts
I dare you to play chess with a ghost
Growing up 20minutes outside of Alton and literally shopping there this video brings me so much joy
Can u guys come to Henry cas I think my house is hinted with ghost
Has anyone else seen the sam and colby tv show on tubi?
Sam and Colby fuscuts next 😅
hi you guys i love yall and the trap house i wish i was apart of it but no i love seeing all yall vids and i just love you guys and the stuff you do dont stop byeeeee
I SAW THEM WHEN THEY WERE THERE
Bro please post more videos
you should definitely do an investigation with the group chat (isaacwhy's friend group), they're hilarious
i was shocked when you said Illinois because I live there🥹
I worked at three different big name hotels and you'd be shocked by the amount of deaths that happen regularly. In fact, most hotels have a storage room(s) that hold "death mattresses" (mattresses people died on) till they can be thrown out. The last property I worked at had 4 death mattresses in storage that were from the last 12 months. It was a really nice hotel too. Also, all three properties were haunted. Two were pretty mild, while the last property was extremely haunted and made me stop working in hotels altogether!
yall was RIGHT in alton and i didnt know ;-; crazy
OH MY GOD I LIVE IN ALTON IM SO SAD I DIDNT RUN INTO YOU GUYS😢😢😢😢
Colby: I have demons attached to me in every hole Sam: *head tilt* In every hole? Rae and Leslie: *whimpering* We don't like it down here.
@unfiltered crew! I wanna see heath, Zane, Matt or Mariah do this!
i would love to see billie eilish and quen in one of these videos. it would be so funny and entertaining
Loved it! How about you try to colab with one of @The Boys or all of them, I think it would be fun!
you guys should come to The Exorcist House in St. Louis Missouri
You guys should hit up markaplier 😂
4:16 it echoed so much I would sing Vanessas trick ( la da dee la da da )
I personally would love to see kelsie davies with sam and colby
@Hasanabi!!! He needs to join you guys!
some of my favorite people in one video
1:00:40 the ghost on the right chair is crossing their leg, actual poses. Absolutely crazy! This location had such positive energy though like all the ghosts were good. ❤
It's new years eve sam Colby give a peck on the cheek ❤
Bebe is back!!!!!!!!!!!
You should try to get mr beast
I want Mark and Ethan in one of these videos ahhaha
Why do they always look like they have diarrhea in the shower in their thumbnails? 🤣😂🤣
31:40 Sam being the only non-gamer who doesn't know Phasmophobia is weirdly endearing 😅
leslie: Michael? eh 😅
MRBEASTTTTTT issss nextttt
💩💩💩💩💩💩
I think the spirits enjoyed Valkyrae and Fuslie's dynamic 😂 if I were a spirit I'd be so entertained
4:27 spider egg sac
I good place where you can go is the 1890 house in new York I went there and all upstairs I have a big headache and when I walk in I felt like something was stabbing my back so I feel like it would be good if you guys go there. I love your vids I’ll love too see you guys go there thank you for taking your time for reading this I love you guys have fun and good luck for everything❤❤❤.
Who else wants to see them collab with Markiplier or The Boys?
You should collab with the boys
You should do a collab with RanbooLive and Tubbo_
Happy new year, everybody :D
@NFrealmusic
you have a SPONSOR from Universal? YOU HAVE A SPONSOR FROM/BY UNIVERSAL!?? ok, when is the Sam and Colby MOVIE!? well done and Happy New Year!!
My 5 year old drew a picture of Sam and Colby which crazy enough you can tell it’s them and I’m the same picture is faze rug lol
UNIVERSAL PICTURES SPONSORED THIS! DAAAAYUUUMMMM
I kinda wanna see you guys go to the Bermuda triangle ngl
YESSSS I LOVE VALKYRAE & FUSLIE!!!!! 🫀🫀🫀🫀
I swear when they where doing the party thing there were two white eyes when they were going to the pool
I live in Alton. It's a great place. You get used to the ghosts here. I've had a lot of encounters here and at this point, that's kinda normal.
Definetly Kris and Celina
Can anyone please tell me where I can send fan mail I have looked all over and can find anywhere to send it and I don’t want to send it to the wrong place
Am I the only one that thought of Michael from the crescent hotel with Celina and Kris🥲
I will say watching this reminds me of a dream I had, where I was actually exploring a haunted location with Sam and Colby. Can't remember everything that happened but it was very distinctive that I was with Sam and Colby. Happy New Year Everyone!!
You guys had this HUGE amazing location and spent the majority of it in the pool , getting NO evidence at all .  Why is it when you ghost hunt you forget how to explore. It doesn’t translate well just talking to flashlights for 25 minutes of the video. XPLR THE LOCATION!!!
I think George and Pearl were switching between speaking through colby and valkyrie. It sounded like colby was speaking both parts a lot idk just my thoughts
I hate New Year’s Eve😭😭
PLEASE do one of these with the new jidion. I'd really love to see one of these videos with him in it and see what he says about it.
Go in five Nights at Freddy's building no actual ghost but it will be fun.
The boys should join yall
Idk why but I feel like grizzy and pezzy would be so funny collabing with them
Omg I would love to see Dan and phil go on a ghost hunt with Sam and Colby
my friend ryan was scared the whole video because he didnt want Valkyrae to get hurt :(
1:03:01 when colby said he stole it does anybody else think it was cause of when pearl died george took her ring? and that pearl was the one who said it.
More Kris and Celina
PLEASE make a video with The Boys soon!!!
You need to go to the state penitentiary in Missouri I can here ppl groaning without a voice box
you guys should come to michigan and check out saginaw and go the house known as the hell house
COLLAB WITH CORYXKENSHIN NOWWw
im watching sam and colby while entering the new year its the best way( in ireland anyway)
At the basement
@samandcolby did you see guys something is watching you in the back at conjuring house
IM CRYING THIS COLLAB IS SOOOOO ICONIC <3 <3 <3 I LOVE Fuslie and Valkyrae. Who would have thought my two favorite worlds would collide!!! WE NEED more collabs with them please. ALso would love to see Rae and Leslie react to this video ! Leslie and Rae's reaction during the video WAS SOOO GOOD AND FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING> I wish the video was longer bc I just love watching them.
Ok at 37:56 you can see a pair of what look like glowing eyes in the door way…
Claim no negative energy Amen
This is awsome guys I love yall and rae and Fulsie were AWSOME and SO funny  keep up the good work!!😊🤗❤
You should go to toraton
We need the sturniolo triplets!! @samandcolby
I would so love to be apart of this show one day just to experience the atmosphere of a place without any knowledge.
Wait did anyone else hear from one of them during the Estes method it said Demon but I don't remember the question 😢
Yall need to invite #JUMPERSJUMP to yalls vids bruh
hey fukpotato, there are no ghosts.  Go play iPad.
My real name is Carol same spelling and everything and that scared the s*** out of me when it said that my name 53:27
"Im a woman“ - Sam
These bros just want to bag these girls.
I luv pizza 👍
Fun fact, my great aunt (who lived in Illinois) lived in the same neighborhood as John Wayne Gacy as he was on his killing spree
Sam and Colby if your seeing this PLEASE COLLAB WITH THE STURNIOLO TRIPLET + MADI FILIPOWICZ  + NATHAN DOE | IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO ME IF U DO THAT <3333
Do a haunted video with Ghostfoo
46:05
at the time 58:46 Colby said why didn’t they come to our party? and then the word thing said the word “tomb” which I thing meant that the one guy died in the pool which is a detail i think they missed but I don’t fully understand what this means either
When they mention the 7ft man named William my brain instantly went to Wilbur Soot. Idk
Cool episode.. but hey let's get two people who know nothing about this stuff, cause they're popular or something, idk. Y'all Sell outs bro
WHY DO I FEEL SO HONORED MY SCHOOLS MASCOT IS THE PIASA BIRD AND YOU PUT IT IN YOUR VIDEO AND I LIVE NOT FAR AWAY I FEEL SO HONORED 😭😭
Now we wait for the Sam and Colby w sturniolos!!😈😜
can y'all take a fortnite creator such as Sypher PK or TG or smth
Only Jesus can free you from these demonic spirits. Look into NDE's. These spirits aren't dead people they are demons. Satan comes as an angel of light, and deceives us. Repent and put your trust in Jesus who was tortured for our sins. Jesus is God's spirit in a man, who was tortured and put on a cross to pay the price of our sins. I grew up doubting God until I encountered the Holy Spirit.
DO A COLLAB WITH THE BOYS
48:59 I love this moment 😂
I LIVE IN ILLINOIS LOL ❤❤
30:23 “speaking of going down”            “I thought you were talking about something else…”            “what-“ Had me dying 😂
A collab with Jakerton would be AWESOME!!!
Oh my gosh they’re great😂😂

at 23:40 who ever edited  them  out the door like that took me tf out LMFAOOOOOO
I never watched these guys before. I liked the video but i feel a little to old watching this it was such a gen z editing like to fast pace for me.  I notice gen z content is super fast paced because it feels like they have no patience, it was still entertaining tho and I'm probably not the target audience.   I personally like when things are not so cut up and rushed. But I'm pretty sure it's a generational thing. Because all gen z content is like that super fast and cut up so for gen z i guess it's good editing.
first video in 2024 anyone else like me? and happy new every one!!!!!
Can you bring tubbo
Luv u guys! Come to Minnesota to Glensheen mansion in Duluth or another haunted mansion! Luv to see you! 😊❤
Why is nobody talking Abt the fact they released merch at zumiez its like my fav mall store
37:20 if fr an example of me overthinking absolutely everything 😂
Im not even lying this happened while i was watching the video, it was at the part where they are in the pool, as im watching i hear a tapping on the window behind me and its a constant tapping where its doing two taps in a constant pace like; ba bbum, pause, ba bum, pause... this happens for like 30 seconds and then i get up to check and as soon as i open the blind the tapping goes very fast and then stops. I cant see anything out of the window bcus its dark outside and the light is coming from inside my room, i dont know what was causing those taps, maybe a bird, maybe someone trying to break in (there have been quite a few robberies near my house lately) or maybe something else i dont know. After this i literally swept through my house with a torch and then checked outside aswell but nothing, throughout this time i kept thinking okay it might be someone trying to break in but nothing.
happy new year sam and colby you my favorite youtuber
AMAZING VIDEO AND ALSO HAPPY NEW YEAR❤❤🎉🎉
Kyle wade and Wyatt from boosted boiz

UNIVERSAL SPONSOR HOW THE FUCK
Am I the only one that thinks sam looks like armin from attack on titan
Hi sam and colby I watch you every day and you guys do not joke around with this stuff
Happy new year guys!!! I’ve been watching you since the vine days and I can’t wait to watch this. You guys are hilarious and always make my day with videos. Have amazing year and sending prayers for the new year to go well 💕
Wait wait but like how cool would it be if they took Dantdm ghost hunting?????? Honestly that would be an amazing video 💖
that was very intense! it was like a demon was holding them and their anger and stuff keeping them trapped so cray
I went to the mall and got it matter fact rn I'm wearing it
Imagine sam and colby collab with the boys, that would be crazy
The editing in this video is on point. These ones made me laugh 9:20  23:40 28:43
Shout out to Sam and Colby for collabing with Rae and Leslie! ... The only thing to do next is to collab with the couple MICHAEL and LILY! I'm pretty sure that would be fire! ....
I'd love to see y'all go on an adventure with Graveyardgirl (Bunny)! It would also be amazing to see you, Garrett Watts and his buddy Andrew go ghost hunting together!
people still live in that hotel
Sam and colby you should ask dream and sapnap to join you on these advrntures😊😊
I’ve played the invitation game, you’re only supposed to light 3 matches or candles. When one doesn’t light that is a bad sprit that shouldn’t be there. You have to tell them they’re not invited. When it does light with no problem that is a sprit that is not a problem. And you can invite them. The whole time you can’t look at the room that is the host room, to end that game your have to have a light to end the game. I’ve played it wrong and I had a bad experience. If you play it again make sure you do it right.
would love for @coryxkenshin to do a video with you
37:57    anybody else see the eyes in the darkness?
I live near Alton! So wish I knew you were going there, that’s awesome
People who have been a fan since before TikTok became a thing⬇️
@crispy
You guys should take @TheBoys AKA narrator, Josh, Eddie, Mully, and juicy
Honestly why did that outro music hit different like bro got me🕺They need to use that for every video fr  Also if that was an actual song, please someone comment what it is😭
Happy new year guys!!!!!!!
i am not gay but sam is hot and colby too
Dear Sam and Colby,  I hope this letter finds you well. I just wanted to express my admiration for your adventurous spirit and the courage you display in your videos. I have been a fan of yours for a long time now and have always been amazed by your willingness to go to extreme lengths for the sake of exploration. I would love to see you both visit the Paris catacombs one day. I know it would be an incredible adventure and I am sure your fans would love to see it too. Thank you for being such an inspiration to me and many others.  Sincerely, A fan
Need to do a vid with The Boys
OMG U SHOULD GET CORYXKENSHIN TO COLLAB WITH YALL
1:03:00 "He stole it" She was talking about her wedding ring that her "husband" took off her finger when identifying her body
The way colby looked behind him so many times, when they were in the pool
1:04:44 it was so cute how they started holding hands 🥰
rae's "but you promise?" reminds me of markiplier playing monopoly like "but you PROMISE this will bring me luck" and bob was like "abso-likely." I feel like that is the situation right now 😂
Aka Wednesday?
YOU FORGOT ABOUT THE PARIS CATACOMBS YOU SAID YOU WOULD DO IT IN YOUR OTHER CATACOMBS VID PLS DO
Imagine the amp group with Sam and Colby
Did no one notice that they said cupcakes e. D.  P. Party
They should bring caseoh
And if not then pls do Jenny Ortega
YOU GUYS SHOULD COLLAB WITH BENOFTHEWEEK
22:09 is that tge 7 ft shadow man behind Rae
You should bring the boys/joshdub/juicy/narrator/eddie
So early on in the video I love that Coldy asks if Rae needs to take a break, it just goes to show that they do actaully care and don't wanna force stuff like this onto others and its so sweet. I love you Sam and Colby, keep doing what you do!
Kupari hotel resort in Croatia is a place I think you guys could go some time in 2024 w/ maybe Kris and Celina or Seth! Happy new year guys!🎉❤😊
Jmancurly

Did anyone else notice the two pair of "eye" looking things at 37:58 when they are going back to the pool room? Or just me?
I want to go on one of These with my friends she loves u guys and I love watching u guys she has a crush on Colby tho lol
YOU GUYS WERE ONLY TWO HOURS FROM ME ARE YOU KIDDING ME
Sam and Colby need to do a collab with OVERNIGHT
when colby said you gotta go, through the estes method and then he also said why me, i think colby was actually speaking as both george and pearl as rae said most things wherent clear for her and only had like a few things clear. but this is just an idea.
When you guys were in the pool it mentioned Michael, maybe it’s saying it’s Michael the angel that saved the people from the wall
You’re meaning to tell me that Valkyrae was 30 minutes away from me?!?1?-!/?:7392
No lie Leslie was being kinda annoying towards the end being loud and moving a lot...
Im actually proud of you guys! Sponsored by Universal Studios and your merch at every Zumies now? Ive watched yall grow for 5 years now. Congrats! 🤘🏾
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening our side of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may have everyone give you the upmost respect
A video with The Boys would be amazing!❤

These girls r dramatic😂😂
I think it would be really cool if you guys got any of the Smosh crew in a video
I live in Alton
Yall  was in my state
manifesting Sam and Colby X Yes Theory in 2024
This video is so awesome I'm gonna go see the movie night swim when it comes out in theaters have a great new year Sam and Colby
idk why but it looks like weird aura around rae during the hosting game like it’s more pronounce then everyone else’s
Alton, Illinois is full of paranormal history! Lots of people say over the river there is a portal. I've visited Alton many times and I always get a headache just driving into the town. Also, the McPikes Mansion is also known for some really creepy things!
You should do a video with @Imbrandonfarris !!
Your Video quality has improved much more continue with this impressive performance ❤
Some of these methods are a bit sketch lol. I mean, I trust Sam and Colby and fully believe they’ve had ghost experiences… but the flashlights can turn on and off with any environmental change (temp, air pressure, etc.) and are a bit faulty when it comes to actual evidence. Same with the SLS reading chairs… it can falsely read chairs as human shapes. Maybe a bit of debunking along with these methods to show it could be paranormal but it could also just be the equipment. I trust the RemPod the most!
Happy new year have fun and be safe love from my side❤❤
IM IN ILLINOISSS
@samandcolby you need to take @TwinParanormal
Go to the crescent hotel again
Kk😂
you all should bring in the boys
anyone else notice the strange pathing of the marble? 0-0

I would love to see Brittany Broski in one of your videos.
@YouShouldKnowPodcast
Slogo jelly cranare or special edd he is the best at ghost hunting and horror games
This video has “Sam and Colby get laid” vibes.
RAEEEE
Please another collab with Rae and Leslie love the quartet chaotic fun vibes! Love the content truly epic✨🙌
Whee they talked about the woman in black who would appear before fatal accidents occur is litterally the movie called The Woman In Black with Daniel radcliff like woah did anyone else notice that connection?!
what a way to wrap out 2023, guys! i absolutely loved this video and i can't wait to see what this 2024 has in store for you all. happy new years eve, sam & colby♡
I’m so excited for the horror movie
That was amazing I love your work 👍fantastic
SAM AND LESLIE REACHING OUT FOR EACHOTHER WHEN TGEY GOT SCARED GOT ME GIGGLING
Daz again!!
Y’all should bring the Sturniolo Triplets somewhere to do a collab
Sam and Colby where have u been I missed y’all’s videos 😭❤
They said my nickname AAAAA my name is Tina which my real name is Athena 🤭
“You’ve cursed us” I think they meant because you guys brought a non-human entity with you because after that it took over the conversation
u guys should collab with sinjin drowning
Can u get Chris and cellina back on I'm begging 😢😮
Can you please investigate the Holiday Inn Express in San Antonio it used to be a prison with an execution room
33:15  Rae: bring a friend you’ll have a good time😭 Leslie: *pacing in the background* Sam: and here’s your friend pacing in the background😂😅
I do not claim any bad energy from this I am sorry if I saw something or someone I shouldnt have seen
I’m eating eggs
My theory is pearl was sick, possessed or something, and she would keep getting hurt. So George would hurt her in self defense or the thing would attach to him and hurt her. They couldn’t figure out what’s happening so they resented each other but they loved the other 1:04:04
Sam and Colby go to the povegila the most haunted place in the world that would probably be your biggest video ever it’s off the coast of Italy somewhere trust me it’d be your biggest video ever and the YouTube channel The Boys wanted to go see the Annabelle doll when they went to go explore the conjuring they said they want to see it
i live there
I really like your haunted videos!!! I like all the different people you have in your videos. Also you guys are funny!!
STOP WITH THE PHOTOS PLEASE
This was a great investigation ❤❤
This video was soooo good!  Thank you for this. The girls did a great job super brave 😍 Sam and Colby you guys need to make a video with mindseed 🤯
I really wanna go see night swim with my Friend but we have a rly small theatre and so it probably won’t be showing it 😢
Seeing my name in a video is the scariest part 💀
Reeee
The party expermient was a disappointment. Shouldve gone with the basics.  Waste of time
Dear Sam and Colby, I want thank you for being here. You guys really cheered me up at my lowest. You guys mean a lot to me. Although some people might have had a bad year this year, you change many lives just because of your content. Thank you for making this an amazing year for me, your fans, friends, and family. I love you guys. ❤
Please collab with @Mindseedtv 😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ #Mindseedtv
Did anyone else notice Colby (kind of) looking over his shoulder at 41:51 ? I think that may have cause the ritual to not work along with the amount of times they struck the match.
24:55 Do you guys hear the rem-pod outside 😭
Around 1:2:56 were they said will come help me what if rae was reffering to william/micheal (aka the 7 foot figure) and the reason he throughs rocks at people is bc he was felling sorrow for her or felt quilt like she told him to help but he didnt get her help quick enough then he started to through rocks at the husbend out of anger to what the husbend did to her...?
Whyd you stopped making estes methods and weird psycho games dude 😂 We want estes methods every roooommmm
Congrats on trending🤘😊
I've done some research and I found out the scariest place in the world is Petra Jordan
yallll i'm from n live in alton n i love how they went to a small town !!!!!!
Hey Sam and Colby I’m coming to California, and, Arizona, Nevada for a vacation and I that we can do a video together bc I’m a medium in April in 2024 so please comment on the comment please and thank you
https://youtube.com/shorts/wNAPKgISKp8?si=a_boJiT68Y7Kjo8f
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE FROM INDIA
I would love to see you travel to the UK and do some more collabs with some id the top paranormal YouTubers there: Ghost Theory and Iconjure for starters. My daughter got me into your videos when y’all first started many years ago now. Thanks for only getting better and better. Congrats on 11 million subs.
WHAT I LIVE SO CLOSE TO THAT STOP WHY WASNT I TOULD😭
Yessir
During the Estes method Colby says he stole it. This could be referring to the ring that the husband took.
I have a group of mines that are haunted alot more day and nite. Ever see a haunted mules pulling ore.  Its ahhh
MR BEAAAST
Graaa
Bushwack18 that would be so much fun
i live in alton, so i know where this is!
i actually went there not too long ago.
Next year video with the boys
Sam trying to say Phasmohobia is like my grandpa trying to say Facebook
You should take Rae and sykunno to the conjoiring to hunt there with Cody and satori
I absolutely love Rae and Leslie, they seem so kind and just so genuine but I don’t think I like them in these types of videos. I don’t know what it is but i just didn’t enjoy them here. Love their energy though and i love Rae’s channel so i was happy to see her collab with Sam and Colby❤️
You guys should check out the Territorial Prison in Deer Lodge Montana. It’s gotta rich history, plenty of spooky things happen there and even  reports of a malevolent entity in solitary. 😮
I love haunted vids and you guys made it even better ❤
id love to see britney broski on here next
@Sam and Colby I got merch for Christmas. The bunny with the knife. I love it very much👍
I think the best person to bring to the next is coryxkenshin
Anyone saw the shadow at 15:59 it freaked me out but I'm not sure if it was like a tree branch 😅
STORY (sam and colby pls respond or give feed back)                                                                                                           so i  was at a xmas sleepover the  other day with me my friend piper(her house) rori and parker. pipers house was built in the 60s and her neighbors house is haunted and spirits come and go through houses in her neighborhood. she has a ouiji board that all of the people there have tried before. we asked the ghost that we were talking to if we could do the estes method with her. she said yes. we used a blindfold and noise canceling headphones with spirit box noises.we ended up talking to 4 spirits. john tiffany tea and jacob. the beginning of the method my friend  rori went first john the  spirit she was talking  to  was a spirit from the neighbors house and he kept repeating my  name most of the time it would be like "help faith pain bang sharp help  her help me" and repeated that the  whole time then  it said my brothers name,  mikey and followed with "he should  help her" and it followed  to say all of my friends frst/last/middle names. it wasscary but that spirit just repeated my name over and over again. that spirit did not   like me at all. i put on the headphones to try this method and as soon as i put them on very clearly a deep voice said leave and i threw the headphones off.  we took a break and tried again parker tried afterwords and she heard a half of a conversation only one side. then piper did it and heard john yelling at tea.  the other side of the converstaion i triedagain and heard tiffany  trying to break up the fight . rori tried and she heard jacob crying in the corner because he was a 7 yo boy when he passed. at the  end of the night we found out that john and tea were once married jacob was their child. tiffany was teas best firend. the reason john kept saying my  name is because i  look identical to aspirit named bella and john cheated on tea with bella and when tea found  out john killed her to hide  it. he then killed jacob and tiffany died from murder from bella. bella died naturally but bella killed jacob. so john was saying my name because he was scared of me and thats why he told me  to leave. the reason he said my friends names and  my brothers name is still inknown. idk what do you  think?
#SOLBY
@clawed_bauty101
Hi Sam and Colby sorry I didn’t spell your name right I was wondering if y’all could give me any advice because I feel like my house is haunted something keeping me awake at night, and I’ve been hearing footsteps and something whispering on my ear attic attic, and I do have a attic and a door but it’s scaring me so I was wondering if I could do any advice like what equipment I should use thank you❤😊
Happy new year guys! Colby u have spirit in 7 holes 😂
They have the best camera angles!
I live in granite city il and i was so upset when i saw they didnt go to the lemp masnsion yet
You guys should try to get the sturniolo triplets to collab with yall. That video would make 2024 the best year ever!!!
You guys should partner with the sturnilio triplets
I would really like to go on one of these adventures with you guys but I'm only 16😢
thanks for coming down to my hometown!! this was really cool to see. that hotel is definitely one of the heaviest places i’ve ever been into
7:28 check those faces out. One looks to be praying and the other looks like she’s  being possessed. 😳 😂 8:47 in my right ear I heard a very demonic voice says, feel me. 😨 16:01 what  floor are they on? (Window).  24:12 left ear, I heard a hi. This has got to be a sound effect Sam and Colby put in…right? And above 👆❓ 58:43 ok, gotta go!😂 1:01:16 left ear, female voice, me! 1:01:20 right ear, male voice, me. 1:01:43 left ear male voice, who said.
Did you guys not see the eyes
You guys should bring the Sturniolo triplets
mah ghowrls
the fact leslie and rae were terrified and sam and colby were just thanking everyone is hilarious😂
I can’t believe a horror movie is coming out on my baby brother's first birthday 😂

HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!!!🎊🎊❤️
IM LIFE PARH 11 LETS GOOOOOOO
It was a big figure that has rocks
I love Sam and Colby but the sls with the chairs is a malfunction because the chairs were different and I have also had an sls while ghost hunting had the same thing with different chairs and we tested it over and over again and we concluded that it is a malfunction with all sls’.😕
who remembers this game from the og trap house
Leslie and lou is the best duo lol😂😂
Go to the insane asylum when you were in the area where there was a murder.
did anybody notice the orb right before he lit the last match?
I saw something behind you bruh
16:03 around this time when he turns the camera to the window, you can see a body standing up and walk away in the window
So, the pic they took at the end of the video has a face in it, a tiny one, like there’s a person behind them. They don’t look happy, can anyone else see it?
my name is cassi so it’s funny hearing them all say cassie 😂also not very common
Leslie and Rae are awesome i watched them play among us during covid. I never knew Fuslie was so pretty. Stunning loved her personality but she is gorgeous as well! Great vid.
PLEASE BRING THE UNFILTERED CREW!!!!!!!
every vid they bring a girl they some rizzers
Get different flashlights, the twisting ones aren’t reliable. Get the button one or the switch
Y’all need to take Jay from @Kubz Scouts !!! He would love this
i need sarah baska and brittany broski to do this w you guys
Who thinks they should collab with Sturniolo Triplets  👇🏻
Can I be in a video please
hi!!! I have a question! if you guys haven't already, can you guys do an investigation in Michigan?
You guys should take LaurenZside with you on a trip like these one day!
this video makes me genuinely trip cause I be thinking someone called my name and then I remember I have the same name as fuslie😭
My grandmother was lives in a honted house she as spayed a host girl in her house
it was weird hearing my nickname in the pool
It would be funny if Markiplier went ghost hunting
January 5th?! That's my birthday 😆

Didn’t they do the host game in the trap house too?
I can't wait for next year's videos to come and see all of your new adventures I love yall❤❤❤❤
Love the vids Sam and Colby!  🥰😍 😻I’ve heard about this hotel in my past but don’t actually know much about it.

This is one of your worst videos sam and colby, didn’t really catch any evidence and it felt more of an entertainment video
Take @ldshadowlady and @smallishbeans on one of these, it would be so fun to watch
You all have been found to be frauds due to your support of Satori  give it a rest
When will the merch come to UK ?
Really, did Colby just say cassie. Guess I know where I need to go. Lol

Pearl is my dead cat's name she died last month.
My best friend is a sceptic and I put on your videos and yesterday when she left she said that she was a 9/10 believer. And she was originally a 5/10. I put on your conjuring series and I showed her the door opening and she said that what made her go from an 8 to a 9. I LOVE YOU GUYS SOOO MUCH! ❤❤
ILLINOIS IM SCREAMING.
“My Vibe-reader is off.” Didn’t sound like what she said, I know I have a dirty mind.                            “My vibrator is off.”
BRO AT 16:06 THERE WAS A FRICKING SPIRIT RUNNING PAST THE WINDOW…
i wanna see @ypk.raye on here 😭🙌
Y’all gotta get courage Ina video
HI SAM AND COLBY I LOVE YOU GUYS

Bro, this is where I live. I'm so mad I won't be back in town till tomorrow.
Awwww come on I needed way more out of Pearl & George that was too short!😭
They need to collab with tana or loey lane
Man, I wish I could go on one of these with Sam and Colby, but my parents and brother would never let me😢 they’re all skeptics when it comes to ghost and other paranormal stuff. This looks like so much fun though.😂
YEAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAPPY NEW YEARSSSSSSSSSSS
HELLO DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THE TWO PAIRS OF EYES IN THE DOORWAY AT 37:56??
There is literally human remains!! If Sam & Colby taught us anything other than to show the power of LOVE, is any relics left behind need to be e checked out cautiously
Lets see ghost hunting with sturniolo triplets !!!
*runs to zumies*
love it
Happy early birthday colby and I love y'alls videos you need to post more often 😢

Sam and Colby can you restock your XPLR rhinestone hoodies. I’ve been watching you for five years now and I haven’t been able to go to any of your tours yet but I will try my best to go to one of your tours soon. I love watching your videos so much. I will definitely ask to buy from your store if you get to restock. 😊

Happy new year
You should take Ben of the week ghost hunting

Hey I loved all of yor videos for the past 6 years you've gotten a lot of attachments onyou guys but hopefully you find a way to take them off,but I was hoping for your next investigation you could take Dakota and Chelsea it would be great with them back
Why don't you hit up morejstu
The images scare me so much that I bet I could go in a hunted house with them and be fine because of those random photos popping up 😂
Please invite the boys!!!!🙏❗❗
Bro people are saying you guys died 💀
I had emailed your business account for advice and I understand you team is busy. It got worse can I send a video of what ever has been tormenting me? You guys see have a great deal of understand when it comes to these sort things. I have many videos of voices, knocks and bangs, video footage of somethings that all came at once, and oddities that are in your lane of expertise. We would greatly appreciate anything at all pertaining to whatever these things are. My kids are big fans and they watch everything you put out. They’re the ones that introduced you guys. Thank you
U should do a video with twin paranormal
Sam and Colby bringing back a Trap House game and I'm here for it. I LOVE THIS EPISODE! ❤️ ❤
I just realized, the guide Dave... is the same name for the trickster spirit of the Conjuring House
The boys @the boys
Please take Dream on an investigation!! I would love to see a video with him!!
"On God"
45:09 I wonder if Michael is some poor chap who passed in the hotel, in someplace else, or if Michael is the Archangel.
Ok so in the pool the box thingy Rae was holding in the pool it said ‘Michael’ and then in the slaughter house Sam said the shadow figures name was ‘Michael’ or so people think so maybe Michael was following yous around in the building   (hopefully it’s not like sally and won’t follow you around)
37:57 bottom right of the door way, wtf are those eyes 👀🤣
NO WAY YALL WERE SO CLOSE TO ME!!!!
Yes! I need more adventures!!!
25:55😂😂
The Boys channel
@jynxzi needs to do one
You should go to the alaskan triangle (if you don’t know what it is look it up on google)
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take the sturniolo triplets on a ghost hunt with you!!! that is all i want lol

CONGRATS ON HAVING A SUCH AN AMAZING SPONSER 🎉🎉🎉 YOU GUYS ARE LIKE THE ONLY YOUTUBE CANNEL I KNOW! THAT HAS BEEN SPONSORED BY UNIVERSAL STUDIOS
you 2 and the boys would be amazing
Happy New year guys😊
Universal as a sponsor?!?! i feel like a proud parent 😭
should have told sykkuno to come , he would have cleansed the whole town with his positive energy.
It would be awesome if you guys could make a video with ranboo or grian, or maybe both! Thanks for all the work you guys put into making al  These videos! ♡ another person/people suggestion I would add is project fear, these are all channels I love and it would be great to see everyone together!
You guys gotta try to get @JohnWolfe on an investigation with you!
This was an amazing vid!! I wanna watch Rae and Leslie’s reaction to this! Specially the Esthes method part!!
So glad y'all posted a new video love yall
I live in Alton up on Milton me and my family do feel entities around us
Please try to colab with Kreekcraft it will be a time where Kreek would be scared and I would love to see Kreekcraft with yall guys pls try to collab with Kreekcraft
Is no one gonna talk about how Colby put us in his pants to cut the camera for the transition to the tour or am I just seeing things😭 1:46
You guys should try and get pezzzy and droid there some of my fav YouTubers in literally love them there so funny
pog u
The girls backing up from the boys and the whole group slowly migrating halfway down the hall was hilarious 😂😂
Sam brought demons up his ass
Please please please do a collab with Brittany Broski!!!!
I'm not sure if Egilea ASMR would do it but she's from Transylvania and does a lot of supernatural ASMR stories :)
Hey Sam and Colby on the boys channel  / juicy vr/eddie vr/josh dub/mully wanted to do a collab with u  on ther recent video they were wanting to collab with u
Guide looks like William Afton
37:57 there were two pairs of eyes in the door to the right😮😮💀
You should do clix
30:23 only people with dirty minds understand
Everytime I see a video like this of Sam and Colby's I get ao excited to do some more ghost hunting of my own!! I would LOVE to do a video with them. Their energies are just so unique and seem to connect with every space they go to💕
@the triplets
This was a really fun video!
it would be really funny if you got schlatt and/or ted nivison on here lmao
@Insym
dude there's this channel called 'the boys' and they've stolen your thumbnails and ideas they're so annoying bro
37:57 am I tripping or are those eyes??
first sponsor that im actually gonna watch
Rae: don’t say his name 🫢 Leslie: does he have a name?🥺
So happy that you guys posted. Love ya guys
First they bring out the DSMP and now the among us girls. Whose next? Mr. Beast??
Bro how is 2024 gonna be crazier this year has been insane
Yoo I don't know if you guys will read this comment but it would be awesome if you do a ghost hunt with oompaville and kallmekris
You guys NEED to bring Matt King on an investigation
The silly jokes and casual edits of funny things makes me think that they've got less serious and more chilled meaning they feel much more comfortable with ghost hunting❤❤
@CoryxKenshin
I think you should invite @CoryxKenshin to one of your videos.
I really hope you’ll hear this but when they say “will”, they’re talking about the money they say money multiple times I think they’re talking about someone not being in their will like the husband or wife
And please tell me that at 37:56 you also see the two shiny eyes in the lower right corner, please, so I'm not the only crazy one
sam and colby you guy take next year fans to adventure
Invite dashie xp
U should do a live
Y’all should take Mr Beast on a hunt
return sam and colby back to its former glory 👇
you should do the krew
thats creepy asf 1:03:02
You guys should do a collaboration with the SIDEMEN and Matt carriker (demolition ranch) Matt has a massive abandoned resort
anyone else remember them playing this same ritual years ago in their house and also a haunted mansion and them being so terrified
Can we just talk about the sponsor thooooo!!! So proud of you boys and all the accomplishments you have made! Here's to a new year of more Sam & Colby!
Its crazy to me that they would be in Alton IL considering i live about a hour deeper into Illinois.
I got scared
Rae is my favorite person 😂 she’s great
Whenever Rae said she’s feeling sick I felt like 🤮….
these are also mini history lessons for me !!
Happy new year🎉
They taught us not to be afraid of the paranormal but to be absolutely terrified of their random jumpscare pictures that they include
W video sam and Colby been watching y’all from the start
Doing the  Party Ritual the chair beside Rae was shaking
Colby and Sam are so caotic and it makes me laugh a lot ❤🤣🤣
this sounds like mineral wells, texas, know for their “crazy water”
if i die before drinking with ghosts, i won’t be going happily
COLLAB WITH THE STURNIOLO TRIPLETS!! ❤❤
That is my home town. And it has its massive hotspots
Do a Collab with the sidemen it would be highly amusing but very unlikely
knowing leslie i KNOW she was fighting her intrusive thoughts to turn around LMAOO
yo  it'd be funny to see you guys do another one with Daz games
WE NEED A SAM AND COLBY AND HAYLEYYBAYLEE COLLAB DUDE. THAT WOULD BE A BLAST!!!! And since Haley lives in nyc, maybe you guys can go to a haunted place somewehre in New York❤
You guys should do a live stream of being in one of the haunted places. A lot of people say it's bogus, and the spirit box and other gear is pre-recorded, the Rem-pod and similar gear has faulty sensors or are designed to go off randomly to make it seem legit, and there's someone in a green suit that's blended in through editing. You should prove them all that this is in fact legit and you guys aren't conning anyone
bring schlatt. i'd pay to see that, it'd be hilarious
W collab w everything and happy New Years y’all🎉❤
I would love to see Sam and Colby with Debsmikle or the sturniolo triplets! That would be hilarious and would definitely be entertaining not only to watch but for their experience as well
SPONSORED NIGHT SWIM IS A MOOD
noooo y'all were ALL in Alton, shoulda invited me, i want to be in a ghost investigation sooo bad (Alton is 25 minutes away from me lol)
Mr beast
Come to Indiana next
You guys should get the sturniolo triplets and do an investigation that would be the coolest collab ever🙏🏼
PLEASE COLLABE WITH THE STURNIOLO TRIPLETS
One day you guys should get a little drunk and see what the spirits do because I feel like they would be more active since you guys might think that your seeing things just because your drunk
HEARING THE STORY CREEPED MEOU5 A BI5 HONESTLY..
I really enjoy the paranormal and stuff, so im like Amanda as I can see spirt and speak to them. I have one in my room and he(Brandon) loves to speak to new people. I would love to go and have an advantage with you guys as he(Brandon) keeps on saying sam and colby. I don't know if he has a message for u from another spirt but I love watching u guys and I would love to go on advantage with you. Hope u had a wonderful 2023.
Sam and Colby should do a colab with the boys
When I was watching ur video I was in the dark I heard footsteps in the hallway and I turned on my light I thought it was my mum but nobody was there 🤷‍♀️
U guys finally posted I have been waiting 😂😂
They were 5 mins from my house and I didn’t know 😭😭😭😭😭

God was watching over him at that moment.
I live in Illinois but you guys weren’t close to me 😭😭
I cannot believe that y’all visited my home town!!!
never knew i needed this collab in my life.
I have been waiting for this for so long! 😭wlejfhksenj I love Rae and Fuslie sm! 💜
anyone saw the eyes at 37:57 to 37:59 in the doorway to the right? got my stomach doing flips, scared the hell out of me ❤😭
you need to do it with mr.beast curw
47:12 NOT THAT COLBY PIC😭
Me when sam and colby post: 🤩🤩🤩🤩yay
The fact that I started my 2024 with this speaks so much how I want my year to be haunted. 🤣🤣
Sam I thought you were done with ghost party/host games after the trap house
In the minute 51:52 i laugh so much 😭
Wait a sec...... I don't think this is the first time that Sam and Colby saw a haunted pool because wasn't the pool on the St. Mary ship haunted?
November?
WAIT WHAT, THIS IS A COLLAB I NEVER EXPECTED TO HAPPEN :O
Sam and Colby should do a collab with Jacksepticeye since he doesn't believe in ghosts and it would be funny asf 😭
1:04:49 I guess Fuslie was high!
First time they showed the pool i thought immediately at a music video from joji to his song monster.
I love how there scared of bugs more than they are ghost
I'm not claiming any negative energy from this video. No one can harm me through this video. No spirits, positive or negative are allowed to enter my home through this video. Lord please protect us all🙏🙏
European roadtrip! Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France...
Bro Colby turned around when he said DONT TURN AROUND 41:46
:3                                                                                                                                                                                                     Reply with the same face as on the top:3
Take Markiplier on a ghost hunt
I swear on everything I have, if you look at minute 15 57 and 16:03 you see a shadow get up and run away, how is that possible when there were only 5 of you in the room
59:58
These guys look like 30 year olds cosplaying as 20 year olds, kinda cringe.
Yooo yall should collab with CoryXKenshin and CaseOh 😂😂
Please bring back Rae and Leslie!!!!
ZUMIES!!? I’m so proud of you boys 🥹🖤👻
Idk after the Cody and Satori debacle, my belief in the paranormal has hit rock bottom. You guys are still entertaining though, so that must count for something! On another note, maybe y’all should try out a Jewish concentration camp? If any place is haunted, it’ll be auschwitz.
GUYS DID ANY OF YOH NOTICED THE BLUE DOOR?!? 34:22 in the swimming pool the door slightly moved.
Who want Sam and Colby x ishowspeed
Watch from 16:00 THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND THE WINDOW THAT WALKED BY!
Love y’all Sam and Colby
HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE!!
Do something in Chicago please i wached since 2016
I love you guys and you should go to the San haven sanotorium in North Dakota Dunseith. It housed tuberculosis patients and water head's.
Another awesome video!! A great video to end 2023, and a special start to my 2024, I might say. I love the energy of all four of you together! I got amused, scared, creeped out, excited, and just wanting more from all of you. I hope Rae and Leslie get to go ghost hinting with you again, Sam and Colby. 🙏
I watch these at night. I’m definitely not a psychopath.
I wish you took the sls camera to conjuring! Xxx
You guys should do a video with Ranboo

People who didn't come from tiktok are allowed to like and comment
Can u do ssundee/ian sometime?
I guarantee most hotels actually do have a lot of deaths take place to the point it's just as normal as that dude nonchalantly telling you who died where and when; I worked at a 7-Eleven for like four months and experienced a man die of a heart attack on the job there, just imagine having to deal with so many guests over the course of the time someone had working at a hotel.
Alright he me out Jacksepticeye on one of their videos
There is a lot of negetivity in that area which creates cursed energy and if the energy is great enough it can create a cursed spirit that latched onto the two girls and that's why they felt heavy and sad
WOW CG ON HAVING A UNIVERSAL SPONSOR YOUS 👏👏👏
Me:Oh, new video! *Not even 5 minutes in* “IM NOT A SPIDER KILLER I SWEAR-“
Yo my boy Colby 😈. I’m 14 rn, but when I’m 18, would you be down to let me join the gang?(please please please please 🙏)
Thank you for this amazing video
2 weeks conjuring in 2024???
Bro colby and valkyrae look good together i think they should get together 😅
37:58 LOOK AT THE OTHER DOOR AT THIS TIME STAMP IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE TWO SETS OF EYES BRO!!!!! I don’t know what it is but I don’t like it
Happy new years in A
universal pictures?!
Shame on you young punks.  You create content which should be taken as theater and pass ot off as real.  You are both frauds becoming rich from views and support from naive people.  You will sow what you reap.
CAN YOU PLS COME TO SUID AFRIKA THERE IS A HONTED HOSPETIL PLS IT IS IN CEMTIN PARK PLS PLS PLS WE WILL GAVE YOU 20M SUB
I bet jynxzi would be a hella funny one lmaooo
But not alton
Guys when Colby said "Money" then "Nightmare" after and lastly "Just remember" don't you think they want an offering or else they will get nightmares or something like that?
People who live in lilinois
We claim no negativity from this video and no spirits can follow us home. Take care.
39:43 lol the animation on the left
Hello Sam and Colby, I know that you do a lot of research in the United States but have you ever thought about an international investigation like in Costa Rica, here are 7 places that could investigate number 1. Sanatorio Durán😰 I went once when I was about 10 or 11 not long ago because I'm 12 years old and  One of my Family members told me that when they went they had a rosary and when they entered a room it broke😰
Bro I watched this at 4 mins ago
Do one with courage jd and leagon that would be the funniest video ever
Can you please have dantdm on in 2024 🙏😂
I love these two but we need more Kris and Celina in future vids!!!! They are like the real ghostbusters!!!
BRING THE STURNIOLO TRIPLETS WITH U GUYS IN 2024!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i would love to see markiplier in a vid, WOULD LOVE IT SO MUTCH

U guys make the best content ever love u guys❤
This was an amazing Year with watching Sam and Colby. This video was amazing and i cant wait for whats going to happen in 2024.
Been waiting for them to post a new video! Thanks guys always look forward to watching yalls paranormal adventures.
Um hello, I live in Alton. Why wasn’t I aware of this. 🫣
You guys should come back here again but bring Doctor Mike
Happy new year guys excited too see what happens in 2024
Me as soon as colby told us about a shadow named William and 5 spirits: FNAF LORE  (I need to get a life)
Is it just me or Colby likes Rae
Not saying this is true or anything but, the whole party ritual was very interesting to me in the fact that it seemingly wasn't done correctly which, as Sam stated, could invite negative entities. Later we know that Pearl's husband, a seemingly negative entity was at the party as he claims he was behind the group the entire time during the Estes method. During the party whilst in the pool the name "Michael" comes up and seems displeased but not outright aggressive. In Christian Theology, the name Michael is tied to the Archangel who is said to be the vanquisher of evil spirits. Perhaps the opening of the ritual being done improperly thus opening it up to negative entities sparked Michael's attention which may be as to why there wasn't a lot of activity picked up in an area otherwise rampant with it. As far fetched as this may sound, the tour guide did say that his experience may have been the work of an Angel attempting to relocate him away from the negative entities, so it may be possible that the location is guarded and watched over by Angels, since the Well could possibly be a portal of sorts, which is why Michael operated so swiftly. Again, not saying this is true but, I see it as a possibility.
23:09 I saw a figure by the blue light in the background
Take ksi and mr beast together it would be hilarious to watch
Hi Colby sam😂🎉
1:06:47
Bro what is that this in the background by what's looks to be a bar 22:08
what happened to spending a week at the conjuring house plzz i want to see it     plz stay a week at the sallie house
what would happen if you turned your neck bc i don’t get it
Oh my God when I heard you were in my area, I literally burst into tears. I love you guys.So much 😂
Wait they have their own camera man too correct? So total of 5 people?
I would love to come behind the scene of ur video and be apart of ur videos as you really helped me understand me and understand what I was going through five years ago. I had lost my grandad five years ago and after he was gone I started seeing him and hearing his voice around me I could also sense his presence I just couldn’t understand why and through watching your videos u really helped me alot
That was funny I loved that///You should invite some people from the amp world/squad to investigate w/ you
This is the first time I’ve seen or heard of a ghost with my nickname, cassie. Always feels so weird to hear.
bro, ngl I saw valkyrae and I instantly clicked. didn't know this Collab could happen
I can’t believe you guys were 25 minutes away from me 😭 I can’t wait to see what next year brings us
Bruh that convo between Sam and Rae about the popcorn bag is hilarious 😂😂 idk if she knows what he was actually talking about though 😂
@Cinedesi crew Jaby Koay,Achara, Steph, Andrew... please bring them to the show.and girls were cutest bravest....they were adorbs
Do the investigation with pro phasmophobia players.
THe sTURNIOLOS !!
I really wish one day they take Grizzy with them
It never lights the first couple tries
Put david donrik one time in your video please
You guys need to collaborate with Eddie and narrator
Its creepy that the same day 30 of december I had a nightmare with a mystery where a little girl was hurt and needed a doctor and at the end I saw the seven foot man out of no where Its the same thing that They are saying even the money for an offering because the girl died thats really creepy I still liked the video 👍🧐
Freaking love you guys🎉🎉❤

So I told my mom about this because she grew up in a small town not far from Alton, and she called me last night because she remembered that she and my aunt took swim lessons there in the early-mid 60’s!
You guys should have the Trash Taste boys on here!
U should bring h1t1 on ur next ghost hunting trip

The spider that big one with small legs is called a "daddy long leg"

Happy New Year, and thank you for helping me through this tough year of 2023❤I'm super excited for the merch. You don't know how much this means to me because I don't shop online, and I am in canada so it means that much more
You show do a video with mr beast or ninja
yoo im from alton
Hey, I was hoping you could buy a 100,000 Lumen Flashlight. It would work exceptionally well in videos. ESPECIALLY those videos when you're exploring a place outside, Ex if you're in a forest! It would light up anything. You could tell if a sound was an animal just stepping in a bush, or if it was a paranormal event! Even though you probably won't see this comment, I will try to get it up!
When Rae said she got scared of her own shadow in the basement carol said cousin. So maybe the shadow man is carols cousin.
Idk if anyone has thought of this but the guide mentioned he thought the light could’ve been a guardian angel. They heard the name Michael in the pool, later followed by prayer. Michael the Arcangel?
Can’t we just get OG Sam and Colby videos back (Abandoned video), and just them doing videos by themselves instead of all this. I hate it when you have “newbies” on.
the fact that im scared to turn around rn it so scary.
i wonder if you guys can get any wrestlers to ghost hunt lol
The tickets r only for US and not UK 😭
who's else has been here long enough to know that sam has played some of these rituals as 3AM challenges in his channel :T
cool
I need a sam and colby / cory collab
You should bring @SSundee to investigate
Love this video and love you guys
ok, during the matches test they said don't turn around and Colby literally turned around a few times.
When Rae said “my vibe rater is off” 😂
did anyone else see the glowing eyes in the door at 37:57
Great tour guide!
26:31 YOUR WHAT IS OFF
OK this could totally be a coincidence, and I don’t know much about my ancestry. But my last name is Harwood, and the moment that they said Lou Harwood my heart jumped for a second.. might need to take an ancestry test now.
I GOT YOUR MERCH YESTERDAY
Omg I’ve literally been ur fan for four yrs u guys r the best I always new that the ghosts are real I always believed in u guys and never doubted ur investigations xx also Colby I also am a huge fan of one direction and Larry 🤭
I want dream to be with you guys @Dream
I miss dakota and chelsea❤
Blau & Ellum would be a good duo to bring! That would be hilarious & fun with those two!
HERE
Wow Im visiting Alton and family currently its crazy that they came here.
Patiently waiting for the day you do an investigation with Kelsi Davies
Can y’all do more videos with Kris? Pleeeease? Also get Charlotte Dobre and Brandon Farris…. And me!
Imagine that water is regular water we drink
Lol “casual flex”
WHY IS SAM AND COLBY BOTH SO FUCKIN FINE ❤❤
DO ANOTHER VIDEO WITH ASH AND ALAINA FROM MORBID!!!!! I know you guys did the SS Salem with them (a video I still have to watch) and post it here on YouTube!!!! I love them, they're the reason I found you guys! Love you both so much, Cant wait to see the things you guys come up with in 2024! 🎉🥰🥰🥰🥰👻
They kinda acted a bit different in this  video
46:01 is probably bc of the body a day later
This collab is totally unexpected for me. But I'm not complaining. Thanks Sam and Colby, Rae, and Leslie <3
Another great Video! I’ve been watching you a lot lately Continue the great work!
Bro i live in east alton..  why did i not know yall were going 😢 hoping yall investigated wyca. Ive investigated there once and its definitely interesting. Just a couple blocks away from mineral springs
Hi Sam and Colby I have a creator idea can you please if you can bring the sturnilio triplets on sry if I did not spell the last name right and also love your content and just got some of y’all’s hoodies.☺️
The reason why I believe that she was talking to Pearl was because it said bracelet on the ovilus. Pearl is another way of saying bracelets, but more fashioned way and plus pearl back in the 1820 was at that hotel entrance.
Amazing video guys happy New year! You got to get koji and ellum twitch streamers they would be fun
hoping..... in 2024 back to 1886 crescent and this time also Basin hotel Eureka springs? theres darker things lurking and underground caves.. even onyx cave is haunted and its so huge and underground ! highly recommend :)
I so want to do this so bad I feel like I could peace together the story of what's going on with the people in the after life. I never donenit before I feel like I could with knowing a little bit of the history.
I missed them so much
My brother looks over at my screen and sees Colby pouring the cups and he goes: "I don't think thats how you summon ghosts" 😂😂
Sam ans Colby, you two should 100% take The Boys to hunt some ghosts with you two! It would be so great!
I’m being serious, I’ve been watching Sam and Colby ever since the were exploring abandoned places. And my as have been checking their channel every day to see if the posted😅😂
Take @brentrivera
just imagine the amount of spiritis ini thire own home.
I love sam and colby
Great video to end the year guys. The ladies were awesome. Can't wait to see what is in store for 2024🎉. Happy New Years 🎉🎉🎉
colby is so opium 😜
Ah yes... an alcoholic spirit. My favorite kind. I think him and me can vibe very well XD.
PLS BRING THEM BACK
Fav youtubers ever, love you guys
omg this is my two worlds colliding. love this! hope to see them back someday
When sam and colby make a vid it make me happy
They should do a collab with the boys(Eddie,mully, narrator,josh, and juicy) it would be amazing
Collab with jesser
Colby:”Do you think jaws made you afraid of the ocean” Me: No- Ghost shark made me afraid of the ocean…
Leslie: whats his name? the little guy Colby:✨mickey✨ Sam: the good guy? Colby: oh..
I love the Estes method amazing
Y'all definitely gotta take DOCTOR MIKE to a haunted location in 2024.
See you all in the next year
Také preston
At 51:17 is that a disembodied voice that i hear? Sounds almost like a scream.
I remember the hosting game from the trap house videos
take Sturniolo Triplets with you!!!!!! God i can imagine it being so fun!
Can you go to the mission in please i absolutely love your videos there fire 24:43
please come to Denmark and ghost Hunt with Mikkel Egelund😍😍

You guys should take Coryxkenshin on a ghost hunt
People who came from any social media platform and simply enjoy watching Sam and Colby are allowed to like this
48:30 The boys are talking about boys thing and the girls are talking about time
It’s crazy cuz I live in Alton
Ugh, what does it take to investigate with you guys?! Make my 2024 happen please dudes! 👻✨
Im actually so happy i see people i regonize i normally watch lots of gamers so to see more people i know with some of my fav youtubers is great thank you Sam and Colby for being such amazing people !<3
How u going coby❤
I’m not even halfway in the video yet but I’m commenting and not that scared yet 😂
When Sam said "Like a married couple to Colby" I think it is simping time
I am not even kidding at 30:53 when they talked about Cassie there was a teacher I had in high school who went to the Mineral Springs on a tour and recorded some audio at the pool area. She showed my class the footage and asked if we noticed anything weird. None of us heard anything until we faintly heard: "Do you want to play?" in a little girl's voice. But the thing is, there were no kids on that tour at all. My teacher didn't even notice that voice until she showed the audio to her young son, who immediately heard it.
i wanna see caseoh go on an ghost adventure
Went to a Zumiez yesterday to try to get a shirt and they only go up to an XL. Wish there were bigger sizes.
I love for y’all to do a collaboration with #twinparanormal with ur style n there’s I think it would b one of the best videos on YouTube… just a thought
No shit in the pool when the guy was talking about paranormal activity there was  a black guy behind him 😮😮
At 15:58 in the window you can see something shadowy go past!!
Micheal is an angel. Maybe he saved your tour guide and the thirty other people
THIS FEELS LIKE A BIRTHDSY PRESENT THEY POSTED THIS ON MY BIRTHDSY YESTERDAY 🥹
NEW VID I LOVE IT😊🎉 (IT GIVES THE CHILLS)
Michael reeves otv with his gf lily should do next
Omggg I take a break from yt and come back to my favorites posting!?😩😩😩
Goodbye 2023 and hello 2024 this year had its ups and downs but this was an amazing year
Sam and Colby is the best
I want the sturnolo triplets to go with you
OKAY AT 8:37 WHEN COLBY SAID "william" PLEASE DONT TELL ME I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT THOUGH OF WILLIAM AFTON-
You should collab with twin Paranormal
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYBODY ❤
IT WOULD BE SO FUNNY WITH KARL JACOBS AND SAPNAP/NICK!!! THEY WOULD BE AMAZING WITH GHOST HUNTING
Having shortness of breath in the pool could be because of the drownings
I just went to universal studios the other day in Orlando Florida
There was some one next to the door of slaughterhouse
Cassie died In the 1900s on her happiest day?....        Only fnaf fans can like
I’m live in Alton
Wooo!
THATS SO RANDOM I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THEM TOGETHER
Happy new year Sam and Colby 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 I love you guys!!!!!
At 43:43 A few feet behind Colby there's a light figure resembling a person who's laying on the ground peeking into the pool because we can only see the head, neck, and slightly the shoulder's, and compared to the rest of the background, it's the lightest/brightest thing there.  Did you see it while watching? Or see it while re-watching?
🎉🎉Happy new year🎉🎉
Happy new year 🎊🎈🎆 2024
@samandcolby love you guys! The conjuring made me go from 7/10 believer to 10/10!your friendship is amazing and why you make such amazing content! It's truly inspiring!

YAYAYAYAYAYA YALL POSTED🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
I’m not scared of ghosts I’m scared of the photos they put randomly throughout the video 😂
Will Neff in one of these videos would be awesome!!

Sponsored by universal.  Could there be a HHN house in the works 🤔🤔🤔
bro, I live in Illinois! Ur my fav channel to watch at night because I’m insane, happy new year!
The hosting game I remember when they first did it
Sam and Colby you should get in contact with The Boys channel, they've started doing a lot more haunted video and reacted to your conjuring house video's. I think it would be really cool if you guys did a video together.
I suggest Joe bartolozzi, Daz (again), or Kris and Celina all great options
Sadly you guys will probably never see this but you should go to the Cave Of The Winds in Colorado
Sometimes if they were calmer I feel like they would pick up even more  activity
they should go back to the bowers mansion
56:26  GUYS WE REALLY NEED TO GET MR BEAST ON A GHOST HUNT!!!!!!  BECAUSE HE IS NOT A BELIEVER WE COULD SEE A FULL ON THING IT WOULD BE SO COOL!!!!!❤❤❤
33:48 , if u look in the window behind Sam u can see something walk past
51:40 why did this make me laugh so hard😂😂
i love you guyssss
Colby looked over his shoulder when he wasn't allowed and then none of the equipment would go off
Happy new!!
If y’all could get superhorrorbro to do a video with you that would be cool
I think this is my favorite tour guide they have had so far
Bro ray and Leslie ARE SO FUNNY😂😂😂
Me being a teeny tiny bit scared due to only being able to fall asleep to Binaural.
I love watching u guys and it was fun seeing Valkyrie and Leslie on ur channel cause I watch them all the time and u guys should totally do a Collab with SSSniperwolf❤❤❤
Just saying that you might have given a little more time. They might be drunk a little.
I LIVE HERE AND I MET THEM OMLLGMGLML
happy new year sam and colby❤
William sounds like my old science teacher lol they have the same name too
You guys need to do a video with @meta psyckicks ‼️‼️
Y’all need to take the boys with yall
You guys should totally collab with Ranboo and Slimecicle! They are a great duo and if they're up for it, I think it would be really cool!
Hey guys big fan but did anyone else say the eyes in the video when cobly was walking out the room check from  37:28 going out and tell me what u see when u pause it 🤔
If I go there and a rock hits my head I really wouldn't care because a rock hit me on my forehead. Soo and me and my sister are also going to investigate scary creppy and where ghosts are so btw colby and Sam are me and my sisters age but 12 years apart my sister 14 years apart apart. I've been sub to for years now I seen your channel a long time ago this is my new account because I keep getting hacked for some dawm reason
Is Colby not looking over his shoulder at 41:50?!
the urge to go under into an estes method just to know what it’s like
I Saw Something Under The Table I Think That’s What’s Controlling Flashlight 😂😂You Guys Are So Smart Fr That’s Why I Love Being Watching Both Of You Guys Most Things in The videos Not Real For Real 😂
Your guy Guide is hilarious.
you guys need to meet Stefan de Vries from thee Netherlands because he likes this too
41:52  Colby turned around lol
Sam and colby taught us to be more scared of bugs then the paranormal
PLS AGAIN WITH SAM AND COLBY AND RAE AND LESLIE BEST QUARTET IVE SEEN YET IT WAS AWESOME THE GIRLS ENERGY AND HUMOUR MIXED WITH SAM AND COLBYS WAS AMAZING TO SEE

SUCH A GOOD EPPPP
I literally live only 40 minutes away from where they filmed at 😮 i’ve even bought crystals from the place 😱
“No shot!” “AYYYYYYYYYYYY” *😐* “That’s not funny” “Oh shit” 💀
I have been watching these to people for so long and I was so excited that it was them ❤️❤️

Wo

At 41:47 it looks like a pair of eyes looking through the doorway just above Colby's head, that freaked me out.
leslie is so cute! she’s like a ball of sunshine 😂 I love her vibes
I Think You and The Old Crew should get back together For One Haunted Video
Best horror video ever
I love this video! While I’m not sleeping at night i might as well just watch Sam and Colby!
2023 ya well den
We need Sam and Colby ghost hunt collab with the Boys in 2024
Sam and Colby need to get Jesser to do one of these videos with you. It would be so funny
I feel honored that this came out on my birthday.
Guys did you realise when skip the video it sounds weird 🤔
omg was so excited to see this because Alton is my hometown and I have soooo many ghost stories there
Ok
The best way to end 2023: watching a Sam and Colby vid!
colby turned around/ 41:53
25:04
Rae's manic laugh all video perfect
Ko
Is desember
It’s crazy how the guy said in pearls room you would hear them arguing and insulting eachother and that’s exactly what happened, I feel horrible for pearl 😭
Im not going to lie I kinda want 25x25 back
need to see more of kris and celina
Please take carter kench and mattie that would be so fun
Wo
Colby remind me of Jim Halpert with all the camera glances
Can you guys go to b&b theaters in waynesvill mo
The banshee reminds me of the man with the upside-down head
i feel like i’ve seen that pool before icl😭
At the beginning when he said that movie was coming out on January fifth I was like perfect because that is my birthday
You need to go to goatman forest you will love ut
You should do a video on YouTube
mi dad just come  home from the hostbl i love you guys
I screamed when I saw the title!!
Anyone else think Ryan bergara and Shane madej from Watcher would be a great collab? Shane is a skeptic STILL somehow Sam and  Colby could change that 😂
Rae and Leslie have been my fave streamers for abt 3 years now this is so insane
Goo Goo Goo  Ion Know Why I’m Always Watching At The Night Time😂😂 Anyways Yall Made It🎉  it’s Not Even 24hours And It’s Millions views Congratulations Guys Yall Deserve This Fr
That was the chillest wassup it’s Sam and Colby ever
COLBY: "THE REMPOD OUTSIDE" 😂😂 IM DEAD 👻
‏‪16:00‬‏ wooooowwwwww
IM NOT A SPIDER KILLER I SWEAR
How dare you call cousin it a hay pile
Colby has demons in his holes confirmed
Bring on 2024. I think you need to take Garrett and Andrew with you!! I was super excited to see you meet them, but this time go ghost hunting with them!
When colby said William I thought he was referring to William Afton
I love Leslie! I've been waiting for this video since her and Rae started mentioning it!
56:34 CASEOH AND JYNXZI!!!
Universal studios being a sponsor is such a flex! Congrats you guys have earned it
IDK why but I also followed to don't turn around rule.
Damn, universal, thats how you know you're getting big
Love u guys well done getting thru this year x❤❤❤❤❤
They need to keep collabing with Kris and Celina!!!!❤
dude.... colby got me throbbing.... ngl 🥵
can you please take mark, sean and ethan with you haha
People listen the Alice box in the pool said Michael and they said the non-human entity was named Michael! So the party did work but they haved negative spirits with them!
Like colby mentioned around 45:52 how they have so much equipment set up yet barely anything is going off compared to other videos really helps me believe that in those times their really was some type of paranormal entity setting them off
Nothings better than watching a sam n colby video at a new year night!!
The boys, Mully, joshdub, eddievr, your narrator, juicy. then I'd love to see like big creators like jacksepticeye, Markiplier and PewDiePie.
Anyone else wants to see gigs crue(Grian, Impulse, Scar and Skizz) doing this??? Awesome vid like always❤❤
YOU WERE IN ALTON ILLINOIS. DUDE I LIVE RIGHT BY THERE
50:17 i feel shacky :( got me laughing
PLEASE take Mackenzie Marie and Kelsi Davies with you guys on the next investigation.
in the double estes method colby said “he stole it” right before rae said i need a doctor i think the he stole it was referring to the wedding ring took off her dead body
jh
Loved seeing Rae and Leslie with your ghost hunting video hope you can bring them back… was great chemistry and vibes.. please more Rae and Leslie in ghost hunting adventures!!
you guys should take the sturniolo triplets on one of these!I would really enjoy it ! ❤️ @sturniolotriplets
Is their back pack a baby bag?
NOT COLBY LOOKING BEHIND HIS SHOULDER AT 41:55
Sykkuno next
These  cut scenes are getting scarier each time they upload
I love how at 16:12 the guide asked for to touch her hand to demonstrate. That's a well-mannered guy there.

51:48 the fact that they said "Dont say his name" because you atract it when you do that in phasmaphobia

🤯
Good work 👏 on scaring the newbies
Someone that is Spirit watching over you
I wish you guys would get the other roomies (Tinakitten, Kktamina, Sykkuno)
SAM AND COLBY IM BEGGING YOU TO INVITE BRANDON FARRIS TO ONE OF THESE tbh im not sure if he's the kind of guy for hunted but we never know until we try, plus his humor and your content feel like it'd be an AMAZING mix!
I honestly think you guys should collab with kelsi Davies she also visits hunted places and connects with them but she also is a  psychic medium which I think would be an interesting experience if you guys collabed
You should collab with markiplier
collab with The boys!!!
Leslie was cousin it
please weston and kalynn
As you were talking about how they’re doing the movies, I hate haunted movies. I only like when you guys do the proper videos and it just makes me feel better. I hate the movies and it doesn’t give me the right feeling, and overall I like you guys more❤❤
@sinjin drowning
Y’all need to do a vid with the sturniolos pleaseeeeeeee
When are the sturniolo triplets coming on ? I have been waiting for over a year
Idk if this would ever happen but I really want to see a collab with you guys and Markiplier.
People who are obsessed with Sam and Colby 👇🏻
“My vibrator is off”  Me: ⏪▶️🤨
Sam and lesli freaking out like fan girls during the estes method is just everythiny!
I know my day is gonna be GREAT when sam and Colby post a new video ❤
I love that you guys are bringing rituals into the videos... like the one @Spookyboos was awesome!!!!
You should collab with  the boys on a haunted adventure (Eddie,juicy,ioshdub,narrator, mully) they did several reaction videos to your recent week at the conjuring house series
I loved this sm😭 also I’d absolutely love to see the sturniolo triplets on ur guys next adventure!!
Hi i watch ur video about "queens mary" 2years ago and i saw this i dont know if you see this i screen shot it i dont know if is the hand or nah😨
Who was the fifth phone?😭😭 41:26
please do a video with sinjin drowning get weston and kalynn
legit go sick watching this
YOU GUYS WERE IN MY TOWN WHAT!!!
Can you guys do one with mr beast or xqc or ishowspeed or kai cenat. I bet those guys will have one of the best reactions to these stuff lmao.
bro what if they get sam sulek
16:01 mirar detrás de la chica en la ventana
Hey Sam and Colby, my name is Allison. My fiancée Lisa LOVES yalls videos and I love watching yall with her, anyway it would be a dream come true for her if we could be in a video with yall❤😊She has been watching yall since yalls vine account, but I've only been watching yall for a year in a half, I have grown to love yalls videos and I even have a lavender chasing demons hoodie❤❤
Dave Is really being our investigation fairy godmother I love it 😂
Thanks to Twitter, I’m here 💯🔥😩
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR A NEW VIDEO 😮😮
i need to see slimecicle in one of the videos, they would have so much fun i think
The best people that you could take on a adventure are the sturniolo triplets
the movies coming out on my birthday and im not even allowed to see it ☠️
a lobotomy was done to basically remove the part of your brain that allows you to feel saddness. Essentially to “cure” depression.
49:00 is killing me 😭 the way this is supposed to be scary but i’m dying laughing is crazy
Cassie is my gfs name😭
It's been a great year with good content and new experiences like always, really looking forward to 2024, Keep doing great things.
Hey Sam and colby nice to know that you guys are still OK after the conjuring
now i realise , the best ghost that exist are alcoholic
The boys I want to see the collab
@Itsfunneh I’d think it be rlly funny and you’d be great friends !!!! ❤
U should hang out with the sturniolo triplets
I dare you Sam and Colby come to Michigan and I’m not afraid to do a haunting with you. I double dog dare you
I love you guys and happy new year in about 10 hours and 3 mins
37:57 eye in door way on right 😅
No one is talking about Colby turning around at 42:00
the two girls were fun to watch: authentic, entertaining.  Thank you for not being so dramatic with your language.....great
did anyone else notice the shadow at 16:00 ??
37:56 there are two pairs of eyes in the bottom right corner near the door like two spirits are just watching them or smth dose anyone see that
I love how sam reaches for Leslie’s arms whenever they get an answer from colby or rae 😭😭😭 1:04:37
@theboys all ready challenged you guys to go to Australia
MY BIRTHDAY IS ON JANUARY 5TH
Hopefully this video is better than there last upload yikes
Of the whooe video im thinking about fnaf but more william afton 😂
Can you have Sapnap on the channel
Not Colby looking over his shoulder in the pool
Heath and Zane
I understand inviting all these other social media people to their investigations to grow their audience and attract new members. But, this was one of the more unenjoyable videos. Rae and Fuslie just didn’t belong in this setting and their pussycat vibes just threw the whole thing off tbh.
colab with the boys
i can't believe my world colideddd... love the viddd
If everyone drank!!!!! who drove home??????? unless u buy a cab :/
COLLABE WITH MARKIPLIER!
Tag mr beast
You guys are so slick how you put in the sponsors,im sold gonna watch it cuz of you guys😅
go to the faze rug tunnel  you have more than 300k likes on the first vid with him(faze rug)
You should have also gone to Elsa just down the road cus they have a little haunted hotel
these guys got the Universal intrested 🫢🫢🫢
56:51 56:51 THE TINAS
Pearl was talking through colby and George through the girl, Rea?
@specialedd @theboys u should doooo a collab with these guys
Please I need to see evan and katlyn doing this lol
Sam and Colby need to come down the NC for the different haunted locations. They should defo visit the home of the family that was killed by their father as well as the old mills and ghost towns!
I'd love to see you guys take Mark and Ethan out ghost hunting. That would be hilarious
As soon as I saw Universal is sponsoring I said out loud "oh Universal nice dudes" I've talked to the screen like I'll actually be heard before but I was so excited and happy for Sam and colby that I didn't even say it consciously so I guess my subconscious is Kris now 😂
OMG pearls relationship is so toxic she deserves better
Pearls story had me in tears. The Estes method showing how he still hurts her makes my heart ache. I hope there comes a day where she can finally know peace
Pewdiepie
Theory : 1:05:00 he wanted his ring back because the ring was the curse or was cursed or he got the ring back it cursed him.
At 34:19 the way Sam says hello? Just makes my day it’s so funny😂
Yessssss🎉🎉🎉🎉 I've been waiting for a next video
As a heinz year old guy(57), not wanting to sound cringey, your guests are always very entertaining and attractive personalities. Thank you all for the entertainment and fun in 2023, and may your "24" be the most successful year yet, Happy New Year everyone.😊
W
We need a video with Dan & Adam from GTI👻
I got xplr merch!!!!
I need a Sam and Colby with dream team video together at be fun to watch

Bring markiplier to investigation with you in 2024
Wow you are the only ones that can make my day better❤‍🩹 LOVE YOU❤♥

Next year go to Granny House

15:55 if you look closely you can see a shadow on the window
What a way to end 2023!! thank you for an amazing year of content and merch and in doing so with everything that went on behind the scenes, it is greatly appreciated and never expected (mainly bc yall always blow what I might expect OUT of the water). So cheers to 2024 and FUCK CANCER
Happy New Years :) :D <3 and hope you guys have something new for us in 2024 :D
You guys should get with CJ Faison. He owns some haunted ranch houses and makes videos of the crap that goes on in there. You guys should definitely get with him.
Sapnap!!
16:00 What was that in the middle window
I want ray William Johnson bc it would be funny but he already knows about you guys and they made a video about you guys
lady in blue uses a name not her own and dies in a hotel lady in red has similar story rose not her real name just like the lady in blue and like that she died in the hotel and had jilted lovers
This was so good video can you bring the sturniolo triplets next year maybe?❤
Mrbeast plsss join
@samandcolby the boys (Eddie, narrator, mully, juicy, and josh) literary in their video of the light house they said that they challenge you guys to go all the way to Australia to do a collab.

First person watching this in 2024🎉
I wanna see you try to take dream and George tbh-
Plz come to Indianapolis!!!!
Never thought I'd see the hosting game again.
I just realised that sam and colby are basically little kids in adult bodies xD
England's most haunted forest
The “eyes” in the door on the right at 37:58?
England's most haunted forest
when they said Michael could they be talking about Archangel Michael??
England's most haunted forest
They are so loud omg

You know you made it when you get sponsored by universal studios 😊
I wanna see OwengeJuice and Smajor go with these guys somewhere
Did ANYONE, SEE THOSE GLOWING LIKE EYES?, THERE WAS TWO OF THEM!! one was looking and one was behind it but it quickly went away
The ghost was from Kashmir,India

Pls do more vids with kris ,you guys together crush it
*Rae and Leslie woooo, I never expected this collab. Been waiting for this for ages!!* ❤
Anyone remember the hosting game on sam’s channel a few years ago? This brings me deja vu
it would be so funny if you guys would take Rebal D with you😂😂
we need a collab with @theboys
I love Sam’s little cute nipples😍
Australians be like is this your first time seeing a spider
Mindseed TV
Y’all need kris and oompaville
sam&colby  collab with some indian youtuber pls
MY GORLS!!!!
I think I saw a shadow when the part at pearl
Been waiting for a vid
Honestly would be kinda cool if you came to denmark (might not be as haunted as other places you've been, but i've witnessed some crazy unexplainable things here!) watching your videos has helped me believe that there is something out there. I'm a medium which i've always just blamed my inner thought for weird random words popping up, until i recently went to visit a clairvoyant (back in 2016) which led me down a spiral of trying to unfold these talents
Sam and Colby you should do a video of not going to a very paranormal place but going to famous celebrities graves such Kobe Bryant, Elvis, juice wrld and etc
You were in my hometown!?! Ahhwwee mannn. 😢 Don’t leave without IMOs pizza. Trust me. lol. Also ain’t nothing scary from Illinois to Missouri except the cr**k heads. 😂😂😂
Faze rug
Ngl i really want Sam and Colby to do a colab with Ranboo or Tubbo or even both!
The best way to end this year is watching sam and colbys new video, i hope u guys have a good new year :D
so when is the collab with Sam and Colby and The Boys happening?
If you guys took @markiplier on a ghost hunting trip with you guys that'd be cool ❤
Your guests were jokestres bruv😂😂😂, love the vids👍
hey sam and colby, you guys should invite the fear& podcast
U guys should go to Ireland or northern Ireland it's really cool also love ur Chanel
Man what a lame party. /s
What if sam and Colby do a collab with MrBeast  Lmao
Its almost 2024....AND I STILL LOVE U GUYS
@Haileeandkendra
Binaural beats only work in headphones and they are for brain activity.
It's my dream to do an investigation w you guys 😭
16:01 wtf was that in the window!!!
I can’t wait to see a collab with the boys!
I wanna see you guys go ghost hunting with Loey Lane and cjades
I saw the post on instagram and I’ve been waiting so much for this vid now it’s finally here
you should just 'horizontal flip' (premiere effect) the SLS cam so audience sees it how it was recorded
please bring the xplr in uk shops cause in the uk we dont have zumies
I would not pause your video for anyone fr
Imagine timthetatman doing this 😂
ninja pls
They should do a collab with twin paranormal that's something I'd definitely watch
Did anyone else notice Colby looked behind him when they were doing the ritual at 41:48
i would love if larray came back
22:13 stop bc I thought the car was a person 😭😭
I’m so happy I got their merch for Xmas, now I can finally watch their vids while wearing the merch and I am wearing the merch while watching it 😊
You guys should do an investigation with The Game Theorist / Matpat. It would be an interesting collab.
The Esthes Method thing is actually INSANE, I've been watching you 2 for like 3 1/2 years and this is the most scary thing that i've watch, the way they answer all your questions immediately gives me a freaking chills in my whole body😵
Sam and Colby did a music video together but it wasn’t there’s it was for someone else song called 													hug- love for fire
I love to watch your videos Sam and Colby and I watch your old videos every day
53:40 i want one too but i live in sweden :( cant yall like provide the merch to H&M too?
WE NEED CORYXKENSHIN TO BE IN YOUR NEXT VIDEO!!! IT WOULD BE EPIC
The way leslie and sam grabbed eachother 😭
The guests were so annoying, especially Leslie .. I don’t understand why they kept squealing. I had to watch the video with subtitles
sponsored by Universal Pictures...WTF?
You guys are great and I love watching the only thing I would ask is stop all talking at once, you all have viable comments but can't always catch what you say. That's it take care
I did the thing where I couldn’t look behind me and now my neck hurts
Sykuno next
Can we appreciate how sam and colby have put so much effort into their videos and making us happy sam and coly gang always ❤❤❤
Go to the most haunted forest it is in the uk
are the tickets available in the uk?also i love your videos sam & colby 🖤
Why no one is talking about Sam’s lockscreen 💀
I think sam and colby should do a collab with @TheBoys
Ahh oh how i wish I could get the xplr merch locally😭😭
spirit box: micheal literally 10 mins later: yeah the non human entity in the basements name is thought to be micheal  😭😭😭 how didn’t they notice that
The guide is so narrative
I can see manje things bc im gifted like your friend amanda even if im 12
Hey I watch your videos all the time time but when you where on the second floor there was something behind fuslie the time is at 16:01 there a black shadow passing by the window
THAT MOVIE IS COMING ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!
Continuing to grift even after conjuring series / Bellaire has proved you as frauds.
I also saw someones eyes watching you from otjerati room at the esat idk how is called method
Omg I waited so long for a new video yes finally I so happy
You've already mucked it uyas you stroke the match 3 times. If you are going to do something least do it properly
What is that zooming behind the girls in the background at 22:10 ?
I WANT TO SEE YOU INVITE SYKKUNO AND BLAU ...IT GONNA BE FUNNY AND I LOVE REA AND LESLIE TOO ❤
Should get grian on the channel!!! It would be so entertaining
my worlds colliding! loved this 🫶 props to the girls for handling it so well despite being so scared
I’m just trying to figure out what the glowing thing in the door way is at 37:58 it also disappears after sam moved his camera a bit so I’m not sure if it could be light reflection or not.
I love your videos!!!!!
Sponsored by universal studios??? Are you guys making a movie???
Omg I hope y'all post more I love y'all so much
How is nobody talking about the eyes glowing on 37:57. Its in the right corner
Someone should call Chris Hanson on Colby 😅
during the hosting game,Colby accidentally looked behind him 41:50 during this time
James Wan by the way also directed Aquaman and Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom.
Missing triggered insaan
31:40 made me laugh so hard from sam
OG sam and colby fans know that this is not the first time of hosting game
Colby trying to get the girls drunk is kind of predatory 😅
My step sister thinks  Colby is fit😊 12:4pm
Guys, her vibrator is off.... I cant be the only one xD 26:29
1:04:37 seeing sam geek out with leslie during this was so funny😭
7:50
VerY GooD VeDios😉🩸🤏👍
True sTorY JaroTroT AlWAy$ in mY Back WaTchinG ME😋
my anxiety level was on peak while they were lighting up the match stick ...even though i knew i could fast forward it and see if it lights up or not idk why i didnt do that and just let my heartbeat rise by every count  ........anyways HAPPY NEW YEAR GUYS WE LOVE U

i cant wait to see what yous have in store for 2024!!! but i cant wait to watch. Also come to Australia  near orange let me know id love to meet yous id be happy to investigate something with yous it would be a dream come true
#samandcolby  i am so happy for the new video  I love you Sam  and Colby and I am so proud of you Sam for running that marathon and raising all that money for #fuck cancer good job keep up the good work and you guys killed 2023 with all the awesome  content you made and defeating all the negative things that was thrown at you guys and you guys have  managed to to overcome it and I hope 2024 is a better year with more content and more historical haunted place’s to go investigate. Maybe even come to Michigan  cause we have some good place that are haunted here we even have  ( The legend of Crying Mary ) people say that at the stroke of midnight every Sunday, the statue cries. So maybe you guys can come here and investigate it
Pls do a video with kelsi davies
Did anyone else hear a little girl say hi
Universal sponsorship????
26:30 rae what
You guys should colab with boys since they've started paranormal videos
POV zam zam water entered the chat!
I think the girls should have their own channel . Colby you ain't professional ghost hunters but you both do think highly of yourselves
i was waiting for leslie to gulp 😭
You should talk these 'rituals' through next time before starting ;D
Sam and Colby yall need to back into the video back to the time 37:58 where u can see eye look at yall

i think this is the best group i have seen with the boys lol
new videoeoeoeoeowowooeoeoeoeeoowowowiwowo❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤          pin?
YOU SHOULD DO A VIDEO WITH THE BOYS
Sam: or you can talk through this little device that Colbys holding.  *colby posing like a whole ass model* 😅  Fierce 😎
Binaural beats are more effective with headphones on due to how the auditory illusion works. Listening over a speaker won't do much.
Sam and colby use should  invite Mr. Beast
Lets go new video
how long will the xplr club clothes be in zumiez :0
We need the sturniolo brothers to do an investigation with you ❤
omg you guys did this on my birthday nov 11
Can you go to the katekoms in the Paris?
I feel like pearl and her husband is cursed and trapped by the portal. It will only make sense tho cuz that's the most haunted thing and same with the pool.
I'm so glad you'll uploaded today omg omg omg omg omg
January 5th is my birthday
Like your video from Asia
When yall say ill be ready soon the second time someone was walking behind sam!

WhaT$?! BehinD ME? Well iT'$ noT Human SpiriT$! 😉🩸🤏
I wish they were actually sceptical when evaluating findings, like the sls camera that picks up figures was definitely bogus cuz those outlines were just tracing the chairs arms and legs…
new video I love it!!!🙃
33:49 look at the window in the background
bring out @theboys
Visit swedens most hunted places!!!❤️
FINALLY A NEW VIDEO THANKS!
Caught me so off guard when the Alice box said Harry (my real name)😭😭
Sam and Colby are my favourite YouTubers
You guys are like the best I’m so glad that you guys could post again. Love the vids
You guys should do this with moistcritical
Jacksepticeye and Ethan, Markiplier and Eathen,  The boys (Juicy, Eddie, Mully, Josh, Narrator)

I got so scared when watching this because I sor a figure that was staring at me and then it touch me 😱
This place is scary but the spiriT$ is almost all GooD! so noT feel so scarY! 😉🩸🤏
Except for celina. Why do you guys all ways bring really annoying females on this channel
1 thing you guys said in a video was Stanley hotel part 3 room 217 so would be pretty cool if you guys go back there!❤happy new years🎉
37:57 can someone tell me what this two eyes looking point were on the colbys right when he was turning around?  Sorry about mistakes english is not my first language
That was scary..
I think it would be really good to film with Siddmen or exporting with fighters and exploring with josh and faze rug for a video idea that would be sick would be spend 12 days in the suicide forest camping  deep inside the forest and going near up the mountain in the forst I think it would be really good and scary it would be fun I hope you both are OK and well and had a good Christmas and New year hope can't wait to see you in 2024  I love you guys the best on YouTube your smashing it see you next year for bangers ❤❤❤❤❤  happy new year ❤❤❤❤
I recommend going to a place called the cecil hotel,located in LA and is known for some serious deaths, There are many people going there and finding lots of paranormal things (such as youtubers called pete motzingo etc...) 2:37 Rip spider
YOU NEED TO DO ANOTHER CONJURING WITH LARRY AND BELLA SECOND TIME ASKING
Thanks for working super hard in 2023 to bring us the most incredible content! We really appreciate all you do for our entertainment!  Now go cleanse yourselfs and enjoy colbs birthday ✌🏼❤️❤️
55:20 when the girls said hi/hey...is it just me or did anyone hear another hi which was like a whisper. 😮
Halo😊
Dont alcools make you easier to get possessed?
I live in UAE so I can’t buy your march😢
At that pool I was peering into one of the doors because I was too scared to go in, I felt something push my chest and I couldn’t breathe for a second, I had to catch my breath, I tried to just play it off as anxiety
Dude you need to tag DanTDM. That will be the best video ever!
13:10 "when do we push her in? She's our bait!" Lmao 🤣😂 so good! Caught me off guard not gonna lie
Yas the kings and queens postedd i was waiting now I can make an edit on tt
I did my first Estes method here
All you guys are amazing love the videos always got me on my toes for suspense. Can't wait for next year🎉. I would love to do a ghost adventure with y'all
Probably Cassie (the little girl) thought of the EMF rope to look like some sort of shiny bracelet... Is why she said that through Ovilus ? Just a theory...  And Happy New Year, great vid!❤
Oh god all those poor people living in there hearing y’all scream 😭😭, part of the hotel has been made into apartments
54:36 was that a massive spider behind colby ?  Edit: underneath the R ?
1:47 Only psychopaths would sniff 😅
IVE BEEN THERE I’m shaking 😮
in 2024 you guys better have the sturniolo triplets pleasee 🙏
Drunk ghost hunting should be a thing
POV : In next year I think they Gonna post a Japan 🇯🇵 Haunted place video.  Just a prediction guys🤔
Rae is absolutely adorable! Leslie is hilarious! They did so good!
Ya'll should do a collab with kpop idols, it would be so funny and you have a lot of kpop fans who watch your content!! ( Maybe Key of SHINee and Irene of Red Velvet or Karina of aespa since they've all seen paranormal stuff in the old building of their company or any of your choice :D)
Get  mrbeast to go with you
they should bring charlie and schlatt
I love you guys because you always make the best videos. I literally wait months for your videos. That's how good your videos are
You guys should do a video with #caylus
This video is insane such a great way to end the year
Has finally I’ve been waiting thanks ur the best YouTuber ever
We need Celine and Michael reeves o here😂
I love Valkyrae and Leslie, started watching them during the era of among us, Rae and Leslie are so funny and chaotic during those times and seeing them here being nice to the dead and ghost are so refreshing, I'm glad they're not being disrespectful and have their manners. this collab was very unexpected yet, I'm glad it happened
47:08-49:15 - I love how you're all just slowly migrating it over to a corner because the girls keep backing away from you.  I would love to see another collab of Sam and Colby playing with Rae and Leslie into a Phasmophobia game. They took them into actual haunted investigations.  Let's see if their investigation skills can work for them in the game. 😆
Love the Chanel never seem to disappoint keep it up
Omg rae!
DAMN UNIVERSAL?😮 congrats guys. Doesn't really help with believability but that doesn't matter 😂
I got scared for a second when i read the title i read fuslie as fusie😭 that would be a entertaining video
love you guys! so proud of my gorls rae and leslie 🥹 literally my dream collab. and the fact that this experience changed their perspective on the paranormal is amazing. surely you can convince them to come back 😂
KRIS AND CELINA!!! ❤❤
Ladies imagine you pull up for a D appointment then right after you're ghost hunting.
Wtf lol why do I always watch this at night
Not gonna lie , but while opening this video i feel hella nauseous, but closing it makes me feel better I don't know why but it happens right after starting this video 😭
I am so disappointed in you boys for taking those poor girls into that pool and use those lights to cast a circle badly inot even a real circle and then you break circle. And you break circle over and over again.
did anyone notice that the name they got in the pool was Michael and the name of the shadow figure man is also Michael...THATS CRAZY!
I love yalll sm❤
Happy new years guys.   -Aussie 🇦🇺.
boys : dont look behind you, colby : looks behind him
Yay
The fact that they were in Fulton county, which isn’t too far from me. Pretty cool, I’m trying to wrap my mind around it lol
Terrible investigation to be honest, I hold you guys up to a great standard for ghost hunting this let me down
Sam and Colby never fail to make me paranoid home alone!
What was that on the right side 37:57
A MESSAGE FROM MY SIDE TO PEOPLE 01:46
I build pirimids with kinetic sand💀....
Me who watched every single video of yours now i have nothing to watch😢
Finally they do cleansings after investigations. Damn…it only took like 7 years and two full-blown attachments. But at least now they’re taking that aspect seriously.
i love fusrae
so 7ft spirits do exist ;V i had a dream/nightmare once. my friend rushed in and said "7ft" while looking terrified and then he ran away. then i felt something grab my wrist and when i woke up, my wrist felt numb ;V
Omg I’ve been waiting for you guys to upload but at 37:58 to 38:00 there’s 2 pairs of glowing eyes by the bottom right of the door on the right side of the screen 😮😅
they were annoying tbh
Am I the only one who's missing the solo investigations without guests? Or at least with guests that know what they're doing?
they got sponsorship from whom? FROM WHOM?!!!!!!! FROMMM WHOMMMMMM?!!!!!!!
@samandcolby if you guys did a collab with MrBeast or Mrwhosetheboss it would be crazy
Seems like George doesn’t want the truth to be out and the wife said “ the truth is out now” that’s why the camera were off he was watching the whole time and she still living the nightmare of being beat and still needs a doctor 😢
bro a horror movie is releasing on my birthday💀💀
LESLIE RAE PLEASE COMEBAAAAACKKKK
W
Go ghost hunting with kai and speed😂
Y’all should do a ghost hunt with kelsi Davies❤
Sam and Colby should honestly do a collab with Markiplier or Coryxkenshin, their reactions would be funny in my opinion at least-
Flashlight work with temperature guys
26:31 wa did she sayyyyyy? 💀
Sam and Colby the flashlights may be turning on and off due to temperature so you might want to consider using the thermal gun to make sure
coryxkhenshin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a great video to end the year. Rae and leslie were rly brave to do all this even though it was their first time.I also love the way that sam kept comforting leslie during the estes method in the end.
Universal as a sponsor of this video?! Thats mad impressive 😍
Weird thing, 8 or 9 years ago I hade a nightmare about the exact same pool there but I didn’t know the name, I didn’t even know it existed
Fun fact colbys birthday is January 2 and my brothers birthday is January 3 and mine is January 4 and my moms is January 5
1:45 lmao when Colby cut the camera 😅😅
BRING MICHAEL REEVES AND LUDWIG AND LILY IN THE NEXT GHOST HUNTING IN 2024!!!!🇵🇭
that one finch never shuts up
Omg 😮 😮 😮 😮 ❤❤❤❤❤so i love you gays bivist fan
Happy new year guyss💗🎉
I honestly want you guys to go ghost hunting with LaurenZside, I think that would be awesome
If you play the video at 37:56 you can see in the right hand side two eyes where flashing because of the light. I was scared after noticing it. Everyone who is reading this comment tell me if you see or not
I need to see Dream and SapNap on one of these! Sapnap is a scaredy-cat and dream is a skeptic!
Pls do a video with the boys
Hi sam and colby I wanted to say thank you for the effort you guys put into your videos.I would love to see sniper wolf with you guys next time HAPPY EARLY NEW YEAR 🎉🎉❤🎉❤❤️😘
Guys , why is there a pair of eyes in the video 37:58 . Towards the right side in the dark.😮😮
56:26 bring kai cenat or amp lmaoooo

I'm still waiting for Garrett and Andrew to come with you guys
THANK GOD i have been waiting for this video for so freaking long ever since Sam and Colby announced the collab…. was still late to watch it tho 😔
I dont claim any negative or any other energy
at 26:29 i though valkyrea said my virator is off :skull:
Sam, why did you want sallie gone?
You should take Markiplier on one of these ghost hunts
You guys should come to sheperdstown wv, one of the most haunted places In America historically. Me and my ex gf went ghost hunting in the graveyards and it was horrifying hearing some of the things the spirit box would say
Please collab with the Sturniolo triplets 🙏🙏
Colby turned around....
Saitama would destroy those ghost
Guys can you go to the amity house please
You 100% should investigate with Colin and Connor from the paranormal files
Can you and Lexi Rivera do a video please please please Sam and Colby please please please please please ❤❤❤
If they're up for it I would like to see a colab with the boys [Eddie, Narrator, Juicy, Josh and Mully] Daz again and BenOfTheWeek! Have a happy new year guys xx
Imagine a collab with sam & colby and mrbeast
when they did the hosting game i was so scared i never turned around during the hole thing and for a hour. thanks sam and colby for the fright and scare :D love ya!
did anyone else see the thing on the sls camera at 1:00:04 in the left corner on top?
You should do another colab with Larry it was so FUNNY
55:42  U hear a guy say go then after the a breath huhhh
Rae is already great to bring to a haunted town, but LESLIE. Its gonna be comedy town real quick.
Sam and Colby why don’t you do a video with the boys because it would be a good collaboration with you two group and like if you take them to the most haunted place so please think about it I am a big fan.
“We are literally surrounded” *pans camera to no one*
Was it just me that look on this at 3 am so it got scary (I was so scared after bc I thought I saw something in my room 😭😭😭)
W vid
i live about 2.5 hour away from here but you should return and check out the Alton Mansion that’s severely haunted and the basement has some crazy stories!!
@The Boys I think it will be funny thing/scariest thing 😅
Take mr beast on a gost ad
Ok but as a 27 yr old, where do I find men that look like Sam and Colby? Asking for a friend 😅
Okay idk if this is just me hearing stuff but I feel like at 41:50 you can hear something whispering “Colby” as Colby is turning and getting dangerously close to looking behind his back
Ok message for Sam and Colby. So my backyard is all wood area but we have cleared a path back there and apparently it is spirteral Indian land so it's a grave site 80 acres of it too so maybe you can go back there and investigate... Things that have happened was I felt a little kid latching onto my leg and noise and moving stuff
I would geniunly loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee to see yall collab with Mai Phamm
UNIVERSAL PICTURES???????!!!!
HEHEHEHHEHEHEHEHE❤️🫰🧍‍♂️🙄😙

Sam and Colby: this is the most active spot Later: this is the most active spot

SAM AND COLBY YOU  NEED TO DO A COLLAB WITH  JUMPER JUMP (CARLOS AND MARCUS ) IT WOULD BE GREAT
Sam and Colby fans   | \/
love you sam and colby happy new year there was a shadow in the window 16:00
few mins in the video and I already want rae and leslie back on the channel!!!
Who is driving back home? Like everyone just drank 💀
Valkeries is a giant baby 😂😂😂
This doesn't relate to anything but ima just tell a story that happened to my mum :) So basically it was at my grandads house, where my mum grew up, and it is haunted, and she was with my nan in the living room just doing their thing, (there is a portal in my grandads house so literally anything could come through) The walls started to turn BLACK. Everything around them was turning black, they both noticed.. so they had to say the Lords prayer (I think) for like 30 minutes and then it left.. it honestly gives me the chills.. And yes, Lay lines go underneath my grandads house! (I don't know if it goes through or underneath I just know you can't see lay lines 😂)
You know what would be funny  If they like did a ghost investigation but while drinking or drunk idk 😭
Can you bring Mr Beast  or From the LOL podcast, only the boys. ❤❤❤❤❤❤love you guys bye
I love you
Hi sam and colby i love this is video ❤ but i I wanna tell you something i had a dream about you Guys  and you Went to swizerland and you guys Where in my school i got Partner up with you guys cause I was the only girl who could speak good english and we  Had a haunted room in our school and you guys exploded out with me  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you guys that maybe nobody did do that like think or Dreamed that so I just wanna say That's how much I love your content. ❤❤❤❤ bye ❤❤❤
Ppl that been here since oct 28 2014.                                                           👇
Sam and Colby should have the boys be in a video
I love these hosting games lord
I know a YouTuber i would love to see in a video of yours. His name is Niki Topgaard and he is from Denmark so if you guys could find a way to reach him i would love to see that video
You guys SO need to collab with Azz and Molly from @adventurehuntersoz4202 We are always up for some paranormal stuff! Azz in fact had an attachment experience earlier this year!
Sam and Colby should do a haunted Collab with Ethan Minnie.  I want to hear him scream and cry.  Ha!
LOLs at around 20mins in Sam makes a comment regarding all the people who died there are the average holiday inn wouldn't have that many fatalities. It made me think of a interview I once saw many years ago with John Cleese regarding his comedy series Fawlty Towers and him chatting to a hotel owner about the biggest problems they experienced. Apparently the hotel owner said, getting rid of the bodies (which led to John Cleese writing an episode in the second season about them trying to move the body of a guest who had died in the night without the other guests seeing).
Sam and Colby: this is the most haunted town in America  Sam and Colby next video: this is the most haun-
Happy new year Sam and colby👍☺
Day 2 of asking the boys to check out the girl scout murder sight in loucast grove Oklahoma
I WANNA GO PARANORMAL!!!!!❤️

the tour guide was so awesome what a lovely guy
maybe what I'm gonna say sounds far fetched but you had the name Michael and it was in November??? And last year in November happend that thing to the guid??? On November 8th the greek orthodox church celebrates the Archangels Michael and Gabriel. I don't know about the catholic church.
Great video to end the year guy's, once again, you guys nailed it, leslie and rae did well. Happy new year guys can't wait for what's next.❤

Amazing vid
16:00 the window @Sam and Colby
Hi Sam and Colby I'm a huge fan and in ur next paranormal video try to whistle like ur whistle frequencies must go up and down for at least 5 to 7 seconds and then stop to wait mainly because I go to places where idk if it has spirits and I would hear very faint whistles coming back to me like I was talking to them so I think that whistling to spirits is another way of communicating towards them Bye
you guys should do a video with anthony padilla!!
Wait whatt? They got sponsored by THE freaking UNIVERSAL.. Dude, u guys are just fab...(Loving ur vids).
The daddy's are back 😩
You two have GOTTA do a video with Garrett Watts and Andrew Siwicki PLEASSE

George and wilbur!! and yall need too post the bloopers of 2023!
Hi Sam and colby! I just want a request that might send you chills and I want you to go!  Llandaff Cathedral… It was built in the 11th century. It’s the most haunted spot in Cardiff! Behind Cathedral there used to be a village and a road, was called ‘road of dead’. Why is that? People carried bodies over the Cathedral which was on the other side of the road. Now let’s get to the spirits! Visitors have reported seeing : faceless figures, Witch like DEMONS,soldiers, monks and priests… Please could you bring Tommyinit, Amanda and Karl Jacob’s? Thank you! Keep up the good work!  - Destiny >3
@TheBoys (Josh,Eddie,Juicy,narrator,mully)
SHADOW IN THE WINDOW AT 15:58
I watch all of the video to lol Yo y’all need to get Matt ride in a video lol
The Alice box says Michael could it be archangel Michael protecting the guide and visitors on November and is it protecting Rae, Leslie, Sam and Colby or it just a shadow figure Michael in the slaughter room, damn so long they are safe nothing matters. I like rae and Leslie expression when Sam and colby give them or set up a challenge for them, it was golden to see their scared expression. Nice video to end 2023.
I want you guys to possibly collab with faze rug again
You should bring James Charles and Larray and more kmk with celina
Colby i love you so much im a big fan sam you to love you guys❤
Have you guys considered bringing CoryxKenshin on the channel. I personally think he is an awesome & funny creator and he deserves to be invited.
We need a sturniolo triplets and sam and colby colab
16:01 ummmmm the plastic In Window???
それはとてもかっこいい
LOL vid was ok but wasnt even scary and literally nothing happened everytime they said they heard something it wasnt heard in the video.. lol
Valk so fine bro gah damn

Sam and colby i know it might be tough to do but can we get like a voice recording of the spirit boxes so we can experience the same as the one whos doing the estes method
i want larray to come back

IM SCARED

People that like Sam and colby  I dare you to like my comment 😊
I would be happy if you invite the twinparanomal plz @twinparanormal
I suggest going to The parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin in Chipping Norton is said to be haunted by the ghost of former vicar Henry Joyes, who was hanged in chains from the church tower for his part in the Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Rising of 1549. In the Unighted kingdom!
I love you sam and colby
Do a collab with MrBeast it would be great
22:23 it was so out of nowhere and hit good at the same time lmaooo
Currently watching this at 3am lol. I’m excited!
Please do one of these with the boys next year, joshdub, narrator, Eddie, juicy, mully. It would be hilarious
Maybe a collab with impulse grian or skizzleman?
when i heard missispi river i immediately thought of jeff buckley
i love spooky videos ❤️
I want to see Sam and Colby go on a hunt with The Boys! All the chaos!!!
ok ghosts whatever I can deal with that but seriously with the spiders right off the bat, you could have put a warning I have never clicked to a different tab so fast
Lord, i claim no dark energy from thisvideo.
Love the videos and when im big on YouTube id love do something with you guys ❤
Sam: plasmaphobia… plasa… what is it? Oh right. Phasomaphobio. Colby: 🥲
just for a collab idea, I think it would be so awesome if you could collab with an Australian creator like Lazarbeam for example.
Who else is waiting for the collab??
I don't like these girls
They should do it with the Sidemen
Wow didn’t know this was in my state. I’m in Chicago but would for sure check this out. Next up is the Chicago videos!
Today is my birthday
the fact that I myself have became a full believer of the paranormal because of Sam and Colby is insane and I also have experienced the paranormal when I was very little, " I was sitting in my living room on a sofa in the dark, it was around midnight to 11pm, and when I looked down the hallway to see if anyone was there because I had a feeling someone was watching me, From my eyes I saw 2 black figures and one of them looked like they were getting dragged on the floor, and they were heading toward the direction of my parents room. I haven't told anyone about this but this was a pretty cool and traumatic story that I feel like the people need to hear.
I want to see a collab with Nate
Is it just me who thought of Carrie by Stephen King when they mentioned a shower of rocks falling on one house 😭
Estes Method for the win like always
Bring in Pokimane and Sykkuno next 🙏🙏
Alright Sam and Colby, listen up! The boys' content are getting so much better than you. You guys could collab and make those content even much better. Or just do your thing and lose your audience to the boys.   Like this comment if you wanna see the boys and sam & colby together 👍
22 :17 i saw a dark figire run past you guys
good video i reacted to it on twitch
I dont claim any negative energy from this video and I do not invite any negative energy and neither any of the viewers. Im sorry for the spirits and we all mean the outmost respect we just want to know your story and thank you for that! Amen
shut the front door!! rae and leslie????????
Dude hearing you guys say you're gonna do the hosting game, reminded of all the crazy games and 3 am challenges you all used to do back at the trap house. Congratulations on ending 2023 of with a bang and cheers to what's to come in 2024
It would be halairous if sam and colby brought markiplier in a video
1:03:53 when he says there was no option. I take that as pearl saying there was no option, but to kill herself
absolute goosebumps i got at the pool its so scarey! But this was a banger video keep up the good work!
I liked my own comment
Rae  kinda looked like Jenna Ortega with the mask on
Take Niki Celina and Kris to the cicel hotel plss
16:00 IS THAT A CAR IN THE WINDOW???
Anyone noticed a shadow on 16:00 behind them
Hey so this might not even been relevant but I just thought I might tell you guys this because it is terrifying it was a dream of one of your guys videos but it’s a video yet to exist the clickbait photo was of a house with a black hole going into the middle of it it was either you or some other YouTubers who were in this house but they brought another person with them a blond woman and in the middle of the night the beds start shaking and she starts screaming bloody murder and she yells we’re all going to die again. so you know  watch out for any houses that a small like a shack and have a whole somewhere in it cause it is dangerous. I was basically watching it all happen from a black and white camera lens in the middle of the night.
Rae and Fuslie are so polite to them ghosts 😅
Sam and Colby, when you were starting the ritual, you can see 2 pairs of eyes staring at you. This was an incredible video, happy new year's 🎉🎉🎉
Who saw the eyes
i never thought some of my favorite and completely awesome creators would collab
Literally a whole lot of nothing and a shit ton of adsssss
At 38 minutes and 45 seconds if you look behind Colby in the double doors looks like a head and shoulders is standing up there in the door way…… go back and watch it
Omg 😱😱😱
@impandskizz
Magic happens. Especially near such a pure water source.
I would love to see the old man energy of imp and skizz join yall in a hunt
26:29 my vibrator is off - Valkyrae
am I the only one who saw the two eyes at 37:52  I literally started to tear up
Can you guys perhaps collab with Kelsi Davies? She’s a great medium and it would be really fun to watch you guys collab together.    Rae and Leslie is such an insane collab with Colby and Sam. I am loving these video. ❤
omg can we can get brittany broski or hasan 🫣🫣
Hold up a tall shadow figure that throws rock at u.I have met that thing and it is no joke cuz it throws rock at u without moving at all while standing at 8 foot
@sidemen
Am I the only one that saw the 2 pairs of eyes in the doorway when the Walked away to go back to the pool after doing the chant
DO CORYXKENSHIN NEXT
it's 3 hours away from me lol
Can yall do a collab with the boys?
Wish you guys would try not to scream as much so we can actually hear things that happen.
Happy new year!!
*I would really love to see @CoryxKenshin featured on one of these videos..👀*
can we talk about how good is fuslie looking
It’s my birthday
U bring the most hyper duo to scary house 😅 alot of funny moment 😂
Colby got 2 of those shots lol ik he was feeling it🤣
At 16:00-16:01 I can clearly see what looks like someone jumping across the space where the window is, right behind Leslie's shoulder. But since they're on the top floor of the building, we can pretty much be certain that there's no way an actual person was outside and up that high jumping across there. The window is covered with plastic, but it's still a little bit translucent just focus on the window and you'll see what seriously looks like some dude doing parkour. Tell me what you guys think. 👻🤘🏻❤️
I love ur videos
Dude. Night vision makes girls even sexier. Mind blown. Rae+Fuslie+Night Vision= Wowza
Awesome video
Omg the movie is the same day as my birthday
A collaboration with Xqc would be something else very funny streamer
My last sam and colby vid before 2024 :c
HAPPY MAFAKASSSS
while they were looking John gacy, I searched for my beloved Jeff,  and there he was ❤
Happy new year to everyone I hope u guys a good New Year’s Day see you guys in the new year love u Sam and Colby (my favourite YouTuber)  :)❤🎉

Colby:what kind of video is this😂😂
Bro, I love Leslie.

I’m wondering if the group chat would do one of these honestly lolol
You guys should go to the haunted mansion in alton I hear it’s really haunted and ik the guy who owns it he said we could go in there for free and go in places other people couldnt but he’s kinda scary he a spooky pookie
These aren't as fun to watch after all the debunking I've seen.

53:27 I FUCKING JUMPED WHEN IT SAID *MY* NAME BRO IM CRYING :loudly_crying_face:
Love this ghost hunt! Rae is awesome! Her and Leslie crushed this investigation. :) my hope is to one day do an investigation with you guys. I do little ghost hunts in my own state and the next one over. Just take equipment and explore like you guys. It’s such an amazing experience. Thank you for posting these videos and helping people believe. Rock on guys! Also, gonna buy some merch from zumies when I get some extra cash!
watching this at 2 in the morning
These girls def made this video a funny one. U have to bring them back again. BUT some where more HAUNTED!! 😉🔥💯 Hopefully they will want too. Since they seen how everything was first hand. They did great 🩷💜 You guys really do have a way with words to get ppl to go with u both 😊 Can't wait for 2024. HAPPY NEW YEAR TO U BOTH 🎉🩵💙
K YALL SHOULD TALK TO BRANDON FERRIS AND LAURENZSIDE-
Sickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
@markiplier
I started watching Sam and Colby around a year or so ago and I became an instant fan they are like my brothers/fathers (p.s I don't have a dad) every since I try to watch them every day and the way that look at me through the camera makes me feel comfort and happiness and warmth their hair their fashion their compassion and friendship their bright shining smile lifts my mood and mental health they are the people I hope to meet and have a similar relationship with my friends as they do Sam's sarcastic emotion is my life Colby's eyes are what I fall deep in late in the night shining brightly among the sun they are pike pools of pure ocean and one day I will fall in and never escape Sam's love and friendship for Colby is like no others I have seen they take risks and have shown minimal fear but it is there not so deep smeared at the surface not able to be seen in most moments then it comes out ,they cry they smile they risk lives and jail time for their fans and life long friendships they are the best I love the way they make me feel even though my life is shit and I have not got someone to go to then they came along and lifted me up high from the ground love you guys ❤
Former hotel worker here! Deaths in hotels are actually insanely common especially in bigger hotels. There was like at least one a week at one of the hotels I worked at in Las Vegas. They just do a really good job about keeping it quiet so they don’t get bad press or lose money.
YOU GUYS SHOULD COLLAB WITH @Jasko!!! also love the content !!!
You guys make days so much better! It's like you guys are my escape from everything! I get happy whenever I see your videos! Happy New Year to you all and I hope you have an amazing 2024! I love you guys sm💕❤️
I love you guys so so much 😮
Do a Collab with the boys
Please make a video with faze rug in 2024🙏🏼
I LIVE HERE.... I SAW YOU GUYS I AM CRYING.......ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i need to see coryxkenshin in their videos
11:48 i have almost the same story but it was an orange ball that i know no one would believe
IM HAPPY THAT YOU GUYS ARE POSTING AGAIN
Thank you for being amazing people and helping us trough tough times.. Thank you Sam and Colby for being you..  please stay yourselfes and keep makeing that amazing content.. Happy new year guys...  and i suggest taking some of you south african fans on a vid 😂😉
I’m going there in JUNE!!!!! What and my favorite YouTuber went there. I can’t wait
my two worlds colliding
I wanna see the sam and Colby x The Boys collab!!!
Sam and colby should go to a haunted place without knowing the backstory and try to figure what happend there. That would be cool.
I go to college in a surrounding town near Alton and have been here many times. Very haunted city! That being said, the people who live here are some of the most friendly people around:)
“My vibrator was off.”💀
Thank you for the amazing videos you guys do and did in 2023. Sam and Colby, I look up to you both. Hope you guys will have a safe New Years. Looking forward of new videos in the new year. ❤you guys
I would never think of sam and colby doing a video with leslie and Rae but im glad they got to make some content together.
Cam we get a Sam and Colby X The boys collab 👉👈
First, I need to know what Colby was doing with his hands at 31:29.  Mans was making jellyfish hands! lmao   Second, I'm so proud of how brave Leslie and Rae were when they were alone!  They were talking politely to the spirits and everything.   And third, thank you to Sam and Colby for bringing us another great episode!  So many times you made me laugh!  I watch this channel half for ghosty stuff and half for watching two besties have a great time together.
Does anyone know where to get stuff for the Estes method if so please help‼️
At 16:00 in the windowthing did someone get up and move orrrr it look like a shadow but idk
I WOULD LOVE RAE AND LESLIE STREAM PLAYING A HORROR GAME WITH SAM AND COLBY!!!! COME ON YOU KNOW THAT IS FIRE CONTENT!
Love you guys be safe ❤
imagine cory did this with you guys (CoryxKenshin)
My favorite is when Cobly hears something and Sam has the balls to say “hello”
49:54 Leslie:*side eye…side…eye*
imagine getting sponsored by the UNIVERSAL
I claim only positive vibes for myself and my family.
saltburn tease at 17:56 lmaoo
Love you guys!! I Watch literally every video❤ PLS have jynxzi or kai cenat as a guest that would be awesome. Jynxzi is so funny man😂 Happy new year!
Leslie randomly checking her pulse throughout the vid had me dead lol
estes method my jaw was actually on the floor 🫢
Lmao v& l moving away from colby lmao
I work at zumiez and everyone’s your clothes
Do a vid with Lazerbeam
Dude here we go!! Another banger 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
my friend and i have already planned a roadtrip to mineral springs and we can't even drive so y'all really proved this place was good 🤣
Leslie is a gem. Hahahaha she was just vibing. The vibe was "terrified" but she vibing.
It'd be cool if you guys, Celina, Kris and the blonde girl from multiple videos (cannot remember her name might be Madison might not be) would look into coming to Winnipeg Manitoba and exploring it's haunted locations. I have a list of them and they aren't the all hype ones like the hotel that they really focus on. I have the WHOLE list to my knowledge. Many experiences since I was child at these places and they're pleasent for all the locations but 2 but those are our of the city of Winnipeg still in the province (state) of Manitoba in Canada. So much rich history in Winnipeg, a handful of places for one video maybe multiple. It would be cool.
Yet another cash grab… sad moment for YouTube
Honestly Bushwack18 would be so funny with yall💀
I WAS AT THE MALL YESTERDAY WIH A FEW FRIENDS AND WE WEREW JUST WALKIN AROUND AND SAW SAMS FACE AND IT WAS HALLARIOUS anyway
SNC SATURDAY?!?!?
anyone else struggling to get into the videos by Sam and Colby ?   The whole tapping ghost thing really ruined the illusion for me.
I would love to see laurenzside do one of these but I don’t know if she could because she has a toddler and baby #2 on the way!
I loved Leslie's reactions haha loved this video! Worth the wait since Leslie talked about it in November!
you kind of make money off the ghost instead of just keeping it quiet and praying for the soul, people really make money off of it
1:02:54  SPOILER ALERT Weird theory….. On this time stamp Sam asks “Are you trapped here?” And Rae says “Will”….. Does that mean that the spirits are trapped because of the 7ft tall figure named “William” who is supposedly a negative entity. And then Colby says “come help me” like maybe someone needs ur help to get free??…..I might be trippin’ but idk…..
who else  see the shadows in the window
Hey Sam and Colby my mom is having a late Christmas and I really hope I get your merch I love y'all so much I watch y'all when I'm was in my up and down and y'all saved me by watching your videos love y'all
123 at night
I’m a big fan of u guys  **like if u are a bug fan of Sam and Colby**
Sturniolo triplets + Sam and Colby 😮
So with the SLS camera, you can't always assume it's a figure. Sometimes a certain shape will make what looks like a humanoid figure through the camera and oftentimes that could be a chair.
13:38 "thats a lotta stairs" THE WAY COLBY SAID THAT WHILE WHEEZING 😂
I saw 2 glowing dots at 37:58 in the room that didn’t have the stairs
26:29 ayo?
I would love to see  Leslie and Rae do this again they were amazing
SYKKUNO AND MIYOUNG!!
WAIT ILLINOIS I AM THERE BROO I WANNA BE IN A VID SO BAS.
the empty pol reminds me of that one scene in pitch perfect were they're having an acapella battle or something.
Kris and Celina
Hell weak
Can’t believe y’all came to alton and I didn’t know…..
Bro after you said a seven foot talk figure man name William I immediately thought about William Afton
At the Stanley: bro remember when we called the spirit box an EMF reader  Now: I lost my EMF reader
That’s a sponsorship to boast about wow nice work!
I’m crossing my fingers that @jacksepticeye and @gabsmolders do an investigation with yall! ❤
SAM AND COLBY AND FULISE ANDD VALKYRAEEE A DREAM
I really hope you guys do a collab with the Sturniolo Triplets soon !! I've been waiting for so long ! Love this video by the way 🖤
You guys should come to Michigan :)
Fan from Sri Lanka...🎉 love your vedios guys❤100% belever about paranomal stuff
I love the energy that Rae and Leslie gave to this video!! I love watching these videos and try to keep up with them whenever yall upload!!! Also, Alton is two hours away from me!!!
Hey guys ❤
I peed my pants watching this 😂😂😂
This is a bit like watching Rae and Leslie run around in Lethal Company 😂
No one: Sam revealing a movie at the start
Omg when they did the party game, I was happy and shaking my head cause Sam used to do rituals XD so got me alittle nostalgic
You guys have to squad up with The Boys!!!
I noticed that leslie (fuslie) kept turning around so after that i was so scared for then
I’m down for 2024! 👻
👇 To keep bringing awesome girl streamers on investigations
i miss the overnight videos
bet when this lil goirl get phasmaphobiabed i.r.l so sad godbless ur innocent soul kid
22:11 DID NO ONE NOTICE THAT RUNNING THING IN THE BACKGROUND!!!
Colby said "He stole it" maybe because his husband said take the ring or something and that's why pearl was mad
Dude I luv ur videos, u should bring Mr beast or the stokes twins for Collab next time
Floor cheese
that girl with the black hair is the perfect target for domnic attachment soo innocent thinking shes soo coool
crazy how lil girls beplaying phsamaphobia efore knwong about spirits thats how lil kids get attachments and thats what happening now days with lil kids messing with this shit bruh ... like wow ...
You need to go to Delaware and go to CJ Faison’s haunted farm
William is actually watching you guys the whole time on the pool watch and focus to the doors and the pool you can see there's a tall shadow that is shaped like a human and blacker than the human shadows and when something touched your neck you looked behind William is gone
I honestly love you’re vids but I wanna see yall with like markiplier or jacksepticeye ts would be mad funny 😭
MAKE ANOTHER VIDEO WITH THEM
@ZaneAndHeath
Did anyone see a figure right outside the pool like  sitting just watching them? @38:42 to 38:50?
Is the one week at corjing house is done?
I know Rae said “vibe reader” but that is NOT what it sounded like 😂😂😂
Was it only me, or did everyone see the full body apparition in the pool for 3 sec
is nobody gonna talk about how sam and colby thought the shadow figures name in the slaughterhouse was michael and at the pool they were talking to a michael?? or is that just a coincidence…
all I'm gonna say is I prefer Kris and even Celina
This collab just makes my heart so happy
Sam and colby , guys that's a statue of Buddha , did you guys know about it ? If not it's ok , but some people might say bad things about you guys . 🙏💜️
why is the guest all girls on ypou guys videos🤔🤔🤔
I really love you guys so much ive been watching you guys since 2017 since ive been watching you guys ive learnt some things, i now explore stuff, im a 100% a believer be safe you guys happy new years!
YOUR TELLING ME YOU WERE IN ILLINOIS THIS WHOLE TIME
My favourite people just posted❤️‍🩹
UNIVERSAL sponsored you????? THIS IS OFFICIALLY THE BEST YT CHANNEL EVER
If they are willing, y'all should take storror to like an abandoned haunted building. Would love to see their reactions.
Rhett & Link!!! Please go ghost hunting! #goodmythicalmorning
40:05 “bébé” help im dying😭
1:05 into the video already don't want to watch due to these two nw random girls... sorry guys.
22:12 there’s like a thing running fast in the back
I would say do video with twin paranormal that would be awesome 👏. Seriously though you guys have work so hard working on this video you both deserve everything… Keep up the good work I hope 2024 will both bring you happiness and success
Sam and colby l what to see it bro
Hope these dudes are as cool in person as they are on video………gotta love the vids. Sup to Sam Colby.
Ok I am 13:11 into this video and I hear a scream it was ecstaticly like the scream my horror story animated uses in their videos and now I am terrified
When the girls were asking what the ghosts name that throws the rock and Colby thought they were talking about the mouse and said Mickey HAD MEEEE LMAOOOO
I love how you guys got along so well even though two of you are ghost hunters and the other two are ghost gamers.
You guys should go to Grovland hotels and Jeffrey's hotels, it's in Groveland CA and coulterville CA, ones right up the hill from the other, lats time my mom was there she said it was getting pretty bad out there
Happy new year sam and Colby love you guys so much   can't wait more videos to come 2024 ♡♡♡
Omg I love the video 🖤🖤🖤 Sam and Colby are the best YouTubers ever🖤🖤
Soooo here’s my thinking again… if this Michael y’all speak of 1. Isn’t human 2. Could be the tall figure 3. Could’ve saved those people… have yall thought about it being a guardian the archangel Michael ? A protector and that’s why he was telling yall about the shadows and may have saved the tour and the guide. 🤷🏽‍♀️ just my thoughts. Michael may have been a good energy
Them being terrified of the spiders even though they are small, they should see the Australian spiders
This video just overall has a different vibe and idk if it’s good or bad..
Did anyone else notice at 16:01 there was a shadow behind the window
Most boring Sam and Colby video eeeeeveerrrrrr I miss the exploration
ABCD…. Scam
Leslie was so funny. She was so excited to sacrifice her friend to the ghost or push her in the pool 😂
Universal sponsorship damn bro 🔥🔥🔥 they probably wanna make a movie about you guys
Imagine doing what you “love” to do with your bro but this time with two beautiful girls…

Lol its always funny seeing peoples reaction that have never been to a haunted places. Love Sam and Colby and can NOT wait for the next new episode.
I loved this video so much an amazing way to end the year! I watch Rae and Leslie’s streams and Sam/Colby videos so this collab was a dream come true! Loved the comedic relief for a pretty scary experience for the girls, they kept up their positive vibes and I think the spirits felt that too
I liked my own comment
You all talk and laugh way to damn much...

Why does Colby sound different, a good different, like more happy
YOU GUYS SHOULD COLLAB WITH THE STURNIOLO TRIPLETS NEXT YEAR!!!
Y'all should come back to Illinois for the Lincoln Square Theater in Decatur!! There's a little girl spirit that sits up in the balcony seats in the theater, and the lights bring out ghost performers!! I think you'd get quite a bit of activity!! :DD
Raeeee and Leslieee?!
Video sponsored by universal studios and they have their merch in zumiez!!! They have come such a long way 🤧 can’t wait for next years uploads 🤞🏼
I can’t wait to see what new hauntings 2024 they’ll experience
@sturniolotriplets cola WITH THEM!!!
Tbh since those vids came out abt them I can’t watch them the same like obvi their reactions aren’t going to be 100% genuine but I feel like they broke the 4th wall and I can’t enjoy the content the same :/

Jynxi
They teaching me more abt the place i live then my school 😭🫶
happy New Year everybody ❤😊
I Liked MY OWN comment
THE BOYS X SAM AND COBLY… would love to see juicy and Colby interact
A 7 foot figure named William?  I guess you watched the haunting of hill house lately.  “When William was alive he felt small, but when he died he was tall”.
@ 16:00/16:01 did anyone else see the figure walk across the window? Could it have been a reflection of some sort or someone walking outside in front of the window?
1:03:02 "he stole it." the ring the husband stole the ring
please just collab with the boys already
I'd really love to see yall take @caylusyt on a ghost hunt ❤
RAE AND LESLIE literally brought us more excitement 💓 💗 💕 💖 💛 😆 💓 💗 40:53 ❤❤
Hey Sam and Colby! You must try and make a video with Kelsi Davies. She makes videos just like you guys!
Sammy’s sandwiches in Alton is a good just fyi
I begging y’all please please bring Charles Brockman it would be such an good collaboration
I didn't even know Universal sponsored videos! Thats so cool! Someone I think would love to do this is Mattie Westbrouck or  Carter Kench. They would both be scared like Rae and Leslie but would love it!
PLEASE GO TO the former Gonjiam Psychiatric Hospital in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province!! WATCH GONJIUM HAUNTED ASYLUM TOO😊
omg, you should totally do a video with Garrett and Andrew!!!!
Hi I watch your whole seven days and conjuring house is so scary and I like this video
boring
Take me!
I love this so much the evidence is crazy but the video is still hilarious!❤️ I love a good Sam and Colby video at midnight😂 and I think y’all should do a video with Rosanna Pansino I think that would be so funny!!❤️
Ph1lza Minecraft and ranboo
would LOVE to see more of them or OTV members! jodi and john would be so fun!! sad it’s only rae in the thumbnail and it doesn’t include leslie, she deserves more hype
I genuinely wanna see lily and Micheal reeves Collab with you guys with micheal Being a comedic genius lily being lily would be an amazing episode specially with a genius with you guys
Crazy video!!! Keep it up kings life you so much❤️❤️❤️  Also: Maybe Dream and SapNap?? I think that would be cool!! If not then then I think that Wilbur and Nikki would be awesome!!!
this is such a fun video  i enjoyed watching you guys just literally hanging out instead of being terrified of the place
Oh yall was 2 hours away from when y'all was making this video😭
Favorite guests ever omg they are the funniest im cryingggg
11:59 "Knocked you up and you felt it?" "Yea, and I let loose...." I can't be the only one who's mind went to terrible places at that moment, right?
at 16:00 you can see something fly by the window
Just realized I'm watching this with my Hell Week hoodie on. ❤  41:40 during the game, Colby looked behind him.
37:57 did any one else see two glowing eyes or is it just me
😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤ 33:50 This is so effing exciting and 12:18am. , in Houston, Texas.
merry chirstmas and happy new years sam and colby ......love from india
try mrbeast and if you get hito beleve then he could pay you guys 10,000 both
I think you guys might be cleansing wrong. You need to make sure you go clockwise with the sage. If you go counterclockwise you are allowing more spirits to follow.
i just saw Val in the movie Family Plan 🤣🤣 like i paused this vid to go watch it w my family and was not expecting her to pop up lol she did such a good job!
17:57 PERVERTS LICKING..... DISGUSTING!!!!!
f u guys for not putting your merch in shops in India
Me and my family do not claim any negative energy from this video
Psalm 23:4
They posted!
1:00:33 Not the ghost crossing its legs 😭
Omg I’m late😮
Last day of 2023 🥹
WAIT ILLINOIS
Please collab with Twin Paranormal!!
41:51 Colby looked over his shoulder… he’s not supposed to do that… 😮
4:35 the dialogue that happens before the info npc gets introduced
YOU GUYS SHOULD DO VIDEOS WITH THE BOYS PEOPLE WHO AGREE 👇🏻
These videos don't scare me it's the ghost editing they add that does
Dude I've been there and I live in Illinois It's kinda creepy there
did anyone else realize when they were doing the hosting game thing the Alice box said Michel then colby said he thought the thing in the basements name was Michel?
you guys should go ghost hunting with  brady noon
Sam and Colby need to come to South Africa! There are so many cool haunted places here.
Oh my gosh I love the popcorn adhd moment😂
For those who do not know the picture of the cliff with the dragon thing is a called the pisa bird it's an original painting from the Indians that were here in alton from the war that took place and it's a myth but idk it could be real I've been in the caves right below that cliff called the pisa caves/park
All “five” of your phones?

Yall should do more fan ones and should come to North Carolina
Why aren't they yelling 😢 I don't like this. It's too peaceful (in the intro)
This actually was a fun episode it made me laugh a little
can you guys take the subscribers with you to different locations, because I think they would love it. Not by selecting some of them but everyone gets a chance.
my mom stayed here with her sister and mom…her and her sister were running away from noises in the dining room at 3 AM 💀
Colby looks behind him at 41:54
please go to the Appalachian mountains
You guys should have CoryxKenshin on your channel. That would be amazing to see both of my favorite people on the same channel at the same time. It would be an awesome experience to see CoryxKenshin try ghost hunting.

You should also collaborate with kelsi Davis she has a hunted doll named Lola and also a medium psychic
Ngl I want to see Sam and Colby play Phasmophobia now.
37:58 you can actually see eyes
After kage sent the email I want to see the boys do this so bad
Really wish I knew you guys where in Alton because it’s only 30 mins from me and I’m on chemo and love watching y’all’s videos and love the paranormal
Markiplier
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits to come around me and to follow me or my loved ones throughout watching this. Thank you for listening our side of the stories. I’m sincerely sorry if I made any glances I shouldn’t have done and may everyone give you the upmost respect.
32:35 during this bit I was just in my bed watching and I’m in the dark cus it makes it funner, but I saw a F*CKING WHITE HAND reach for me over my phone and obviously I freaked out and turned on my phone flash light. Guess what nothing, I’m going to continue watching in the morning
lol love these two how you got them to do this 🤣🤣
anyone else see eyes in the door at 37:57 ?
I eged to this (just joking)
Ever since some YouTubers tried to debunk your channel your getting less evidence and it just seems more boring. Could be the ghost/spirits are scared but you need a massive collaboration  like the boys I don’t want random boring YouTubers like this on a ghost hunt no offence but they are not funny
The spirit saying "On God" had me dying laughing @ 1:03:56
Can't wait to watch this! I'm from Illinois and three hrs from Alton. I wish Sam and Colby would be able to reach out to me, i have a couple personal experiences i would like to share them and ask for their advice. 😮
Lethal company without quota
The boys should go with you guys
we have a pool and I going swimming tonight at 12:00 so I'm watching this to scar me. also Happy New year!
yall should collab with LLS rhino and noah and maybe rob
Your excused Colby
Ya'll should really collaborate with kelsi davies!
I realized that the Alice box said Michael, November, and prayer. Earlier before that their guide had mentioned the possibility of a guardian angel, and one of the most notorious angels that people may call on for protection is Arch Angel Michael. It is possible that Arch Angel Michael had been there to save the guide and the tourists from the wall collapsing 1 year ago in November.
37:01 “as soon as you turn over your shoulder…” Turns over shoulder right away😂
Like this comment of u want sam and colby to invite/call someone from India to investigate with them plzzzzzz sam n coly collab with Indians also !!!!😭😭😢
Happy early birthday Colby 🖤💛  Your age will always change but your soul will never age❤  Love yall 🐨 Sorry for bad spelling
35:20 😂 “can I turn around? If I turn around do I scare them? If I don’t scare them is it ok? What happens if it’s effed up? Should I tell you if I turn around?😂😂😂😂 Sam and Colby u devious motherfuckers telling them these gadgets and methods are legit 😂
@The Boys need to go on a ghost hunt w Sam and Colby RN
Colby talking about the mouse is so cute 😊
❤❤❤❤❤Nice to meet cha Dan the man.😊 10:04
I followed these two guys from the boys channel. The boys need to collaborate with these guys.
@caseoh do it
Jacksepticeye markiplier and the boys all would be awesome collabs on this channel obviously wishful thinking but I reckon it'd be fun too watch 😂
Whoa! You all were like 3 hours south of me!
Congratulations on 11.2m it is so nice to see you'll go from 2021 which if I remember right is 4 - 5m maybe I'm wrong but congratulations 🎉🎉🎉
That match part made my skin CRAWL! I was so scared to see if the match would light or not 🕯️😭

Yo Sam and Colby idk if it was yall shadow but in 16:01 in the window there like a shadow but idk but stay safe yall!!❤
I love sam and colbys videos, they are basically movies at this point
@timthetatman Would love to see him with you guys
Come to Billings Montana we have so many haunted places and all around Montana too so many too pick from
The jkbros would be perfect calab for you guys
Omgggg!! You guys finally did an investigation in my home state!
I did not know there was a haunted town out here Alton is like 30 minuets away from where i stay
Almost 1 mill views in 7hrs. Regardless of what my personal opinions are (I’m a John Wolfe fan/debunk guy), y’all are efffing killing it. 🤟🎉👏
@samandcolby You guys should definitely collab with @TheBoys I think it would be awesome and such an interesting experience for them since they’re definitely curious about the paranormal and want to catch evidence.
This is Awesome, I was there with my friends a couple years ago, the guy who owns the hotel was going to give us a personal tour, my friends unfortunately weren't interested
that ring was expansive that's he wants it back
I've been waiting for this video
The girls are soooooooooooo cute🥺 I wish i had friends like yall  Anyway awesome video boys .. and girls  Love yah nd always be safe❤
I used to live in Alton ill . back in 2019 to 2020 . honestly i liked the little town even though it was the said to be the most haunted small town in America i didnt get really any paranormal activity when i lived there but i didnt go out much sense the pandemic and 2019 was a coatic moving process . i will say it did have weird vibes especially at night id think id see silhouettes and thought it was 1 of the 5 people in the house . I woke up one time yelling for my mother  and   also heard lots of noises  at my time there .
i would love to see you guys try the hosting ritual again! this was such a cool video!
36:56 when they said that they weren't allowed to look behind them all i could think of was the greek myth of orpheus and eurydice.... i'm a nerd
Guide: women report feeling sadness in this room  Sam: I’m a woman  😂😂😂 a new vid the day before my birthday is amazing
Sam and Colby you know that Seth bordon is related to Lizzie bordon
W-wait- November 11 midnight?! That's my Birthday!
HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY COLBYY!!! 🎉
You need to invite Sabrina Carpenter. Her dry humor and bluntness would be so funny here
Pa shout out lods raven ramos from dubai

the crash sound in the start is what i believe was because of building being old plus after their conjuring video was kinda debunked i cant trust the rempod any more

33:48 in the window behind Sam you can see what looks like a shadow figure walking behind them!!!

People who didn’t come from a short or TikTok are aloud to like this………….
So apparently there were pirates in the mississippi river , and pirates usually got a limp  (45:00)
Poor Pearl 😔
Poor Sam being stressed while trying to light a match😢
This makes me wish I could go ghost hunting
I've watched so many of these videos more than once even, but something felt uneasy about this one, literally got chills 😭

Happy newyear everyone!!
Wow - that really was one of the clearest estes method sessions you guys have captured! The only one that tops this for me was the one at Zac Bagan's Haunted Museum!
It would be such a wild fun experience if I ever had a chance to investigate the Blue Eyed Six in my hometown. I had a crazy experience there that made me believe in the paranormal.
How about with @bretmanrock ???
Could Michael be referring to the Archangel Michael? His energy is blue so it could be him.
Dude I’m like 3 hours away from Illinois, this just made my day
Hahahaha Lmao@colby’s face during the ritual.  🙄  Not to say I would be ANY better ladies! Great job
Happy new year in advance and thank you for taking risks for us
Do any of y’all have your eyes tear up whenever your scared? I dunno whenever I get super scared my tear ducts just go off the wall.
Yes!!! ❤ thanks for coming to Illinois!! Wish I could have been there!!
I have the guts to come out…. I am not famous but hey I will come……..  Love you guys ❤❤❤

Such and amazing year of investigations for 2023, can't wait for many more to come, I would love to see you guys do an adventure with Alex Wassabi and Roi Guava (from SPICY FRUIT). Happy New Year guys 🎉🎉, love you ❤❤
I watch this having experience with the paranormal. i am very young, but this is amazing work!!
*This Was An Emotional Year For Both Sam And Colby. Sam Dealing With A Break Up And Colby With Cancer. But, What Doesn't Kill You ALWAYS Makes You Stronger... Just Like Sam And Colby's Friendship. They've Been Through Some Amazing Highs And Not So Amazing Lows. But, Sam And Colby Have Been Together Through Them All. What's In Store For Sam And Colby In 2024?! Who Knows. Even Bigger And Better Haunted Places... To Put Chills Down Our Spines And Scares On Our Faces. We Shall See!! But, What I Am SURE Of Is It's Going To Be EPIC!! Here's To A New Year Of Awesome Adventures!! Always Be Safe!! Big Hugs, Erica!!*
How in the world did you guys get UNIVERSAL Studios to sponsor you guys? 😮
Literally every Sam and Colby haunted investigation goes like this: “So yeah there’s a demon and all. No biggie-OH MY GOSH ITS A SPIDER”

Hey guys I was wondering if you can travel to Australia to go to Australia’s most haunted place
I would be so happy if they collabed with Sofia Dossi and her brother or Sofie and Lexi Hensler (again). I think it would be so good. Also bringing back Niki and more of Kris and Celina
Please bring Jschlatt and Ted Nevisson for the next videos, they would be hilarious!! Happy new year!!
Hey You guys are in my home state!!!

Go with imbrandonfarris

"Whatever you do don't look behind you", Leslie spins and points camera behind her to get Colby on camera. Colby twisting his torso 180 looking around while waiting for a response in the deep end. The ritual went wrong as soon as it started lol.
Hi😊
Y'all need to collab with the Sturniolo triplets both channels are my favorite to watch and I feel like it would be a fire video and I feel like everyone would love to watch it.
i live in illinois nd my birthday is td dec 30
I feel like when at the end when they were doing Estes method Pearl and George were in couple counseling like talking and sorting things out 😂
Yo sam an colby hmu brothers I wanna do a paranormal investigation  if you  not scared lol
I love your guys videos I've watched every single one of them and would love to some investigating I'm super into paranormal stuff I do believe in spirits but never had any experience myself I would absolutely love to some investigating
Sam and Fuslies energy together during the Estes method was so cute (not in a romantic way)
1:03:07 Colby says “he stole it” pearl died and then George TOOK her wedding ring… he stole her wedding ring

Colby looked behind him multiple times during the hosting game… also Sam has got guts to walk and get the night vision camera on his own

The umbrellas on the ceiling of the lobby is so creative and beautiful
9:42 William... By the pool.  Makes him Wet Willy.

I'm excited to see what amazing, thrilling video's that you guys make in 2024! Thank you so much for making my 2023 epic, love you Sam and Colby, hope that you guys had an amazing 2023!
I love how they thought the Sailor dude was michael when it was the shadow figure that throws rocks
Where are you collecting them??? 💀😭 these collabs are kinda weird but awsome🥰
Could I ask you guys something? I’d be really nice if there was a trigger warning before you show spider so close. I have arachnophobia and it was really distressing to watch the beginning of this video and some others that you have been doing that as well. I’d really appreciate it. Thank you 🩷🙏🏼🥹
It's funny how stuff always happens or appears and the cameras aren't recording
fakest one yet.
I hate it that in my country, the time is 11hr ahead, and that my mom doesn't allow me to hv my phone at night so I'll oni see the new videos like 9hr ltr😢😢😢   But I love ur vids guys continue making more 🙏🙏🙏
So hyped for this 😊

Dear Sam and Colby, I thought I should let you know how much you videos make me happy. Also congrats on getting sponsored by UNIVERSAL that’s awesome! Your videos mean a lot to me! I haven’t been here since day one, but I have seen day one and beyond. Thanks you so much for showing all of us fans love ❤. I hope you have a nice new year and safe travels to wherever your hearts next adventure is!  Sincerely, Me  ❎(I don’t have your x but this one will have to do)
Y’all need to take Brandon Farris somewhere I’d die laughing
I have been watching you guys for 2021
To be able to be sponsored by UNIVERSAL is an extreme feat that I’ve never seen before 🤯
I love Sam and Colby
The collab we didn’t know we needed!! I think it’s Ethan Nestor’s turn next haha get him in there
Does anyone else think that Kelsi davies and Sam and Colby should do a collab that would honestly be so cool

Sam and Colby x The Boys would be a 🔥collab
Can we all agree that Sam & Colby are by far the BEST ghost investigators on the internet?!😊 I love them so freaking much 💓
IF SAM AND COLBY COLLAB WITH MELANIE MARTINEZ Y'KNOW IT'S GONNA BE GREAT😼😼😼
NEW VIDEO!!!
You guys are truly amazing and I truly appreciate everything you do to share the knowledge of this kind of thing, I will assume everyone else here would say that same but truly I enjoy learning more about the history of things and figuring out how everything plays in a way, These new places that are discovered and the stories that were held secret for so long being told is truly mesmerizing. The energy you two express through it all is phenomenal, I love how you are able to goof around and enjoy yourself even if its a serious place. finding the joy and the positive in it all. To add, everyone who joins in, all the new people who get to experience these things first hand thanks to you both is an amazing sight to see!! I hope this year brings new knowledge and new experiences!! ❤️
I'M SOOOO SOOOOO SURPISED THERE'S VALKYRAE AND FUSLIE IN THE TITLEE I'm so excited to watch this episode!
I gotta see rae react to the last part 1:05:34
You guys should take The Boys ghost hunting next year
Is anyone more scared by the pictures and videos in between rather than the actual video Edit: all the pics are scary but specifically the pictures of like the shadow figures and stuff that Sam and Colby put in.
Bailey Sarian.. Mr. Beast.. Karl.. Chandler  More Kris and Celina!!
37:57 I see two glowing eyes just staring at them
EARLYY!!!
I would love to see you guys take the Sturnolio triplets to an investigation
Love your videos. My 13th birthday was yesterday so I am glad I could watch you guys today and make my day better.
It’s so crazy to hear my name in the box broooo, literally jumped from my bed 😖😭WTFFFF
46:33 I can’t believe they didn’t comment on anything the Alice box said in this part; chair, prayer, and shadows… because not only was Rae sitting on a chair, she was holding her hands up to her face in a way that looked as if she was praying and her shadow was cast on the wall. Idk but that’s a lot they missed
@sssniperwolf ❤ do a vid. With them! 😂❤
kris and celina!!
You guys should go with The Boys
go to Princeville Illinois and go to the haunted house with demon that scream at people scary asf
Ngl Blaustoise And Ellum would be so good to have.
sam sulek would be funny to watch in a ghost hunting video
Seeing people I used to love watching play among us again is so awesome!
Would love to see Heath, Zane, Mariah, and Matt from unfiltered in a video!
Me, my family, and my loved ones do not claim any negative or bad energy. We will always be protected and save from anything bad. Thank you
Earlyyyyyyyyyyyyy ❤

Ne
You guys should take doctor Mike on an adventure
16:00, i’m surely not the only person who saw a shadow behind fuslie on the windows going right to left, especially when one’s moving 😨
I love the vids keep up the good work
Changing your rating on how much you believe in the paranormal because of how spooked you are is a bit ridiculous. It's 100% natural to be scared of something that you have no definite idea of what it is. It's the natural human fear of the unknown. Why else do you think so many people are afraid to die? It's because we don't know for sure what awaits us afterwards.
Who are they 🙌🏼😂🤡
@onlyjayus @crazycae @samandcolby  I would love to see you guys on an investigation together! Bella, you're amazing and so smart and Car your always up for anything! Sam and Colby are incredible and would never let anything happen to you guys.... Please I've thought about this so often. I love you all! ❤❤❤❤❤
Caseoh and jynxzi on a ghost hunt would be wild 😅 57:13
HEY GUYS!! just wanted to point out, if you're ever in wisconsin PLEASE try out the siren bridge! and if you're ever in racine, wisconsin (woohoo my place!!) visit microtel Inn & suites AND Ivanhoe Pub!!!

When they did the party and they couldn’t turn their head. I felt as I also couldn’t. I was terrified too.

I've been watching your videos for a while and I've been dealing with the paranormal all my life and would like to find answers. You guys do a fantastic job! I love how you guys have fun but also are very respectful to the spirits and your guests if they are having a difficult time. Much respect to what you guys do. Thank you and keep up the great work! ❤
I think the boys would be a good collab
Please go to Mineral Wells TX! They still have their “crazy water” and is home to the Baker hotel which they are planning on reopening in 2026. They also have an incredibly haunted house called the Hill House of Mineral Wells. LOTS of activity including scratching, shoving, and yanking guests.  PLEASE check it out!

Another year of Sam and Colby saving me from boredom. Happy new Year love you guys! ❤🎉
Corpse would be pretty good to go to some haunted place but he hasn't face reveal
Not me being 3hour away from Alton
Y’all think they was capping? And they could hear
@markiplier, jacksepticeye and ethan!!! Please!!! That would be AWESOME
you guys should do one with unspeackable and his friends!
Yeh when i went to watch fnaf, there was an "ad" of night swim before the movie, and it about killed my ears with all that woman's screaming
I’m such a huge fan! Ive been watching for 5 years and I’m genuinely scared to see all of the chaos that is yet to come in future vids😂❤😊
Not me noticing I would have seen them because they filmed this 30 minutes from where I live.
I think lanaraee end her stream
Ngl I don’t know if I’m hallucinating or some shit but ever sense watching them I’ve been seeing like clear things in my room but not clear enough so I see it and now I’m just gonna act like it’s Sam and Colby’s fault🤓☝️
I hope Rea is in more of these videos 😂
Wow I can't believe how long I've been watching you both! It's amazing how far you've come! Ride or die for Sam and colby!! ❤
Sam and Colby should have on their video james charles and sssniperwolf on their channel
might b cuz im a lil sick but them girls needto go home lmaoo
Sam kept trying to touch on Leslie
collab with @justdustin
It's 4:27am in the UK for me.....
It's been a while since one of this videos actually made me scared, at this point i don't watch the videos for the scary but for you guys, this video made me actually be scared, i looked behind my shoulder multiple times, i looked around my room multiple times, this is probably my new favorite video of you guys, can't wait to see what 2024 has in store for you two!  PS: Sorry for bad English, not my normal language!
I don't know if yall saw that but at the pool you can see the 7ft man behind the guy talking to you guys
Go to Australia and do one with Lachlan and lazarbeam
I can't comment on the pinned comment but some people I'd love to see you collab with are:   Rhett and Link (good mythical morning)  Try guys Glam and Gore ❤
2 types of creators that I watch, that I never thought I would see together. This was a AWESOME collab
Mr.Beast
WHY IS THE SCARIEST PARTS OF THESE THE PICTURES?! Like those pictures look uncanny
It's on laylines!!!!
Watching this at 11:30 pm and the entire house is dark except for the tv light illuminating the small room I am is absolutely terrifying on top of this video.
Since Sam and Colby asked for more sacrif- I mean creators to collab with! And since you've already had Kris Why not bring over her lovely boyfriend oompaville on over! Nothing says couple goals like going ghost hunting 😂❤
I’ve been subscribed since 2016 and I couldn’t be more proud of y’all
You guys need to bring in the rest of the roomies! Imagine miyoung here lol
38:49
I kid you not, I screamed when they said where they were. THEY WERE 15 MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE🤭🤭
I would love to see you guys do a collaboration with Eddie VR and the Boys!! That would b epic! And if course more collaborations with kall me Kris and Celina Spooky Boo! Thank u! My granddaughter and I love watching your  videos together!
At 16:02 there seems to be a large shadow in the window
If I don’t see a vid with The Boys in 2024 im gonna be sad, but plz keep up the good work your videos are my favorite, love you guys ❤
So happy another day of I didn’t know they posted so I get to watch a “surprise post”
A box that has  every single word and it chooses to say hi is probably the most terrifying word it can say haha
And 😮the only reason people watch you is because you are both cute, honestly you're cute guys.
Where The Boys at?🗣️ (juicy, Eddie, mully, Josh, and narrator)
Def wanna see more with Celina and Chris 🥰 wanna see you guys go to hotel monte vista in flagstaff Arizona the info on this place is insane💯
At forty minutes I got this weird feeling and I just got heartburn
kris and Celina only the  best 100%
bro the car at 22:12 made me shit my self omg 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 hahahaha😂
Is it just me or val's friend leslie is being a bit clingy to colby 🤨 Who else thought so? And no! If you dont agree then dont bother replying to argue 🙄
It might be just me but I feel like it would be so much fun but also so terrifying to be on one of their videos.. 😃  Edit: I FORGOT TO SAY THIS BUT CONGRATS ON THE SPONSOR FROM UNIVERSAL AND I’M SO EXCITED FOR 2024!! :D
I love to see Valkyrae & Fuslie again but I doubt they will😢. I also think they should not use phones on site of investigation and keep it on airplane mode as most equipments will get affected and that has been proved by many.
Y’all real for this!!! You came to Alton Illinois that’s amazing!!!
Please come to Gettysburg, PA You won’t be disappointed
Of course horror and hot girls go together ❤
bruh I wanna do one of these investigations with them so bad I think itd be super fun to actually see and feel the experience irl as opposed to watching a video
@Jacksepticeye please take him to a haunted castle or something
VALKYRIE!!! AND SAM AND COLBY?!! GOOD COLLAB AFTER KRIS AND CELINE
Imagine jacksepticeye and Ethan went on a ghost hunt
Fakers are back 😂😂
I've been through Alton countless times, and I never knew the history of this place.
Crazy y’all have merch at zummies.
@spicyfruit ya need to get on this 😅
You guys are way too goofy to take seriously. ABSDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Great! New video. Was starting to rewatch old ones
The way Rae holding the flashlight like she’s in the horror game
I wonder if they ended up in each others beds that night? (Only cause they where scared, bunch of dirty minded people) 🧐
Me seeing Sam and Colby posted a new video before I had to go to work  *Automatically saved video to watch later for a treat for after work* 😅❤
31:53 when Rae and Leslie were talking there was screaming in the background
The boys
I would love to see The Click and One Topic in a video with you guys!
So much for the week at the conjuring house huh
literally i want to go ghost hunting w you guys so bad. it's unreal
"Dude throws rocks... What a dick."    Best line spoken in a Sam & Colby video ever! 😂😂
You guys are the best ❤❤❤
Please collab with Meta physkicks!
46:05 Could it have been referring to Michael the Archangel as the orb who pushed the guide, saving the people from the falling bricks?
I live near Illinois that’s crazy I can go see haunted house’s and hotel’s 😅
Last video of the year is deff dope.
I wish you guys did weekly videos every week
A NEWW VIDEOOO RAHH!!!
Is it just me or at 37:56 the door on the right there is eyes glowing …
Fun fact my cousin actually helped produced the movie night swim. 😮
you guys should go to the joliet prison!
You guys need to come to Australia, spend a month here investigating some of our most haunted sights, Monte Christo, Arradale where I witnessed for myself the most incredible encounter and I was a skeptic til that night only about 18 months ago
Omg this video was cool but I am not a big fan of the girls bc they will not stop talking I am so sorry I am not a hater I just get annoyed
It would be awesome if Sam and Colby invited the Boys in the videos.
Dude I live by there I never knew that it was  haunted
I’m so glad my girls were apart of this AHHH
It’s 8 at night and my step mom thought I was crazy for watching Sam and Colby this late😂
You guys should collaborate with kelsi Davies and meet Lola!
bruh you were in illinois and i didn’t know
My two worlds collided 😂
16:00, I that a car that goes passed on the left side of Leslie or a spirit?🤔  Thank you for the amazing content you have brought in 2024, it has truly changed so many lives. Can't wait to see what you both bring out in 2024!  Keep up the amazing work
anyone els want to see Ryan Bergara and Shane Madej from the channel Watcher to join Sam and Colby
They should try get kai cenat to do a ghost hunt
Finalllllyyyyyyyyyy a video❤❤
Omg that’s crazy I’m not far from Alton Illinois
I hope you guys get some time to relax- you guys look so tired 😢
Colby turned around at 41:53
Colby turned his head during the game and no one noticed 41:51
I’m gonna challenge myself and watch the whole thing at exactly 12:06am
This is the closest they’ve traveled to me
Let me just say I love Sam and Colby so much, they were the first ghost channel I ever watched and it has been amazing!! I also love Rae and Leslie, they have such great energy, and they did amazing!!! There is no way I would have been able to do the game, I would have opted out, cause I know for a fact I would have looked behind me. One thing I hope that changes in the videos to come is honestly focusing more on the investigations and trying to capture things. I feel like most of their newer videos have become them goofing off more than actually ghost hunting!! So it's a little disappointing when an hour long video is only like 30 mins of communicating. I would have really liked to have seen all of  them spend more time in the slaughter house, and more time in the pool ( without playing the game). I feel like they felt pressured into doing the game, just so guys would have a good video. And that's not fair, especially for it to be their first time.( now if it was with someone with more experience then sure.)
yk its a good day when sam and colby post
omg my favorite youtubers in a vid. never thought they'd collab 🥹❤️
14:26 Sam is Trans confirmed 😂
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST VIDEOS IVE SEEN!!! also the whiskey they took isnt strong. Get it out dated, rum, and vodka with a nice flavor kinda then you got it🤌🤌
i got some of y’all’s merch from zumiez
Id do anything to go ghosthunting with you guys
You should do one with Brandon farris and ian boggs in the next one
love yall take care!!
@kalani the ghost hunter @twinparanormal request PLEASE happy new year y'all
I NEED to see Flamingo/Albert do something with Sam and Colby. I feel like they've got really similar vibes and could be so entertaining.
There are pair of glowing eyes in dark doorway at 37:57 . On the right side 😶
@Imbrandonfarrid
im in hawaii rn and instead of going out im staying in watching this, im not missing a sam and colby video for anything
Gurl how are you guys? Scared of a spider oh wait I’m Australian
you guys should invite @Markiplier or @Jacksepticeye.
This ep was so good!!! I loved Colby's comedy lol. I would absolutely LOVE to see the Jane Addams Hull House(Chicago) be investigated, it seems so creepy and definitely worth investigating IMO. Keep up the great work, love watching you guys!!!!
Nothing made my day, but watching Sam and Colby 😭💗
Omg
Only true Sam and Colby fans can like this comment ✖️
ILYSMMM SAM AND Colby YOU SHOULD TAKE THE BOYS, THEY WANETD TO DO A COLLAB WITH YOU FOR A WHILE. ❤😊
Hey I don’t know if Sam and Colby will see this but I would love to see them go to The Amityville House I’ve always wanted to go but was never able to but if you guys could help them this it would be wonderful.I also can’t believe how it has been another year of Sam and Colby.And hopefully Sam doesn’t get another attachment 😂
COLBY BROK THE RULS HE LOOKED BEHINED HIM
Hey Sam and Colby ik ur prob not gonna see this but Im gonna try anyway. Ok so I would like to see if y'all could try to find some haunted places in Cape Girardeau Missouri because I've seen some places that look haunted but I can't explore them cuz don't have any equipment so I would like for u to reply to this and let me know if u could try or not if not it's totally fine. Anyways love all of ur guy's work and keep going on . Also don't forget to cleanse urself after every haunted place u go, we can't have anymore attachments on Sam or Colby
should call it 6miniutes and 66 seconds of hell.
Stay safe out in these places and always be protected going in and when ur coming out make sure nothing is coming with u
“Throw a rock?” 😂 Leslie is funny
I think i shit myself laughing at colby
You should take Mr beast ghost hunting
can you also bring shubble, tomminnit and dream. thats all
Why won’t you invite kids to your chanell
I should not have watched this at night IM SCARED 😭
I love you guys
I love the boys don’t get me wrong… but these things that Sam try’s I don’t think lands well….. just my opinion. Saying that if they were in Melbourne Australia and they said hey Al come ghost hunt with us, I wouldn’t care what new thing Sam wanted to try lol
Bebe
Sam and Colby should invite Daz Games/Black to do a haunted video with them, that would be amazing 😊 🙏🙏
At 56:26 you asked for creator collab recommendations. @Grian  @impulseSV  @GoodTimesWithScar  @MCSkizzleman  Would be great people  They are gamers/ phasmophobia players and mentioned going on real ghost hunts a few times during there videos. I understand it is unrealistic to get them all together for a video but I believe it would be entertaining, and would be quite entertaining.
Dang I was surprised at around 30 mins in, Sam trying to, get something in… I don’t blame him… both them girls are hella cute
I grew up 20 minutes from Alton, Illinois. I saw my first ever ghost in the McPike Mansion. My boss at the time and I were on a radio show with the owner of the house and she invited us to the house after the show. I saw Mr. McPike standing at the top of the stairs clear as day. He was staring at me until I looked away to see if anyone else noticed then he went away. Alton definitely has some haunted spots!
BRING CODY AND SATORI TO TALK IN THE POOL
LESS GOOOO RAE AND LESLIE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Imagine jynxzi here 😭😭
not even two minutes in and colby shoves the camera into his cholb
Who else loves Sam and Colby ?    ☟♥︎
37:58 people who saw a glowing thing out of nowhere
I can’t explain how excited I was waiting for this video!!!!! ❤
I want to see Jay from Kubz Scouts and Lauren from Laurenzside in one of their videos
Wow never expected to see valk here 😂😂😂
Gotta collab with the boys next
Me please but I am from 🇮🇳
I do not claim ANY negative energy from this video in ANY way. Be safe guys! We love you!!!!
at 15:58 you willl see somthing in the window move
Do more challenge videos guys!!
Favorite guests ever omg they are the funniest im cryingggg
I swear I sa
No fu***** Where you came up With a new video
Who wants to see the Sturniolo triplets on here?
I kinda want Johnnie guilbert to do this with y’all
The intro scared the crap out of me, had my earbuds up to full blast and I didn’t know it.
Get @tx2offical to go on one!
u have to do a ghost hunt with the sidemen
Bring Nate! Where has he been!?🎉😂
So excited to watch this tonight!! Always a good day when Sam and Colby post!🖤🖤
YOU GUYS SHOULD TAKE KARL AND THE STURNIOLO TRIPLETS !!!!! WE NEED MORE SAM AND COLBY WITH KARL AND THE TRIPLETS WOULD BE SO FUN
The whole not looking over your shoulder had me dying 😂😂 watching you guys move like you kinked you neck😂😂
I would love a collab with Sam and Colby and The Boys from Aus. It would be a banger investigation video! ❤
I literally love Rae and Leslie! So happy to see them doing more than games. It was nice seeing them out of their element! Love yall
Gacey didn't kill ppl while he was dressed as a clown 😂. He was actually gay and would kill the males he brought home with him. The clown thing was a COMPLETELY separate gig as entertainment for kids' birthday parties.
How come the first cut is after Sam puts the camera to his crotch
william and michael, huh? interesting...
You should do a video with “the boys” they have said in videos they want to do a video with you guys
@ 1:03:02 when Colby said he stole it, I feel like it was Pearl saying that her husband stole the ring
I would love too see @LazarBeam to do a investigation with you guys 🤣
PLEEAAASSEE take Garret Watts and Andrew!!! It's all I ever want in life
I love Leslie lol
i get so happy when you guys upload on the duo channel.

Hi
jefferson city penitentiary!
I wanna see @gizzytv and droid do a video with sam and colby it would complete my life
yall guys should do another unsolved murder house
❤️❤️
I’m a physic medium and a clairvoyant. I’ve always wanted to meet you guys, and your in my state! I live in IL, and would be so honored to help you guys with a video one day. That is probably my dream, to help y’all in a video.
not me being scared because my nick name is cassie and i almost drowned when i was little 👀 my aunt jumped in to save me
i got the xplr angel knit sweater for christmas and i love it so much!!!
Where can we find the directions on the match ritual to try it out ?*
What? Universal pictures sponsors y’all ? Cha Ching!
Love Sam and Colby but I literally watch Rae or Leslie for almost 6 hours a day so this collab was amazing
Tipsy ghost hunting with Rae, Leslie, Sam, and colby
it’s insane to me that you guys went from illegally doing adventures to being sponsored by UNIVERSAL PICTURES
It’s funny how they progressively got closer to the chairs because they kept on stepping back. 😂
or have trisha paytas that would be so iconic and yall know it
I cant wait for more videos to come out! I love your content and your doing amazing!
Pls post more atleste once a week
I love you colby and sam I'm your biggest fan 💕
Happy new year to all in advance
People who didn't come from tiktok can like this comment..
I have been watching your videos since i was 8 years old or even younger and i am now 17 turning 18 in 6 months i love your ghost hunting videos because i have the ability to slightly feel energy’s when i was younger i was able to communicate with spirits but i have lost that ability over time but you have inspired me to want to start ghost hunting myself my dad has the same ability as me but his is stronger than mine and he also loves your videos and a funny thing is that i live in Kansas and have since i was 1 and a half years old i live in hugoton Kansas which is a very small town i really love your videos i know i keep saying that but its true i hope y’all have a great day/night.
the amount of times leslie and colby turned around lol
We need another faze rug collab  Like if you agree
We love you Sam and Colby please put Valkyrae and Fuslie in another video we love their energy
plz have tana ghost hunt w yall
The fact that I am in Illinois rn🥲😭 Nad actually sooo close to that
You should invite Kai cenat for 2024 videos it would be iconic!!!
Colby zooming and unzooming so much in the beginning of video😂
you guys should go visit the catacombs in parissssss!!!!!
Ghost Hunting Starts: 33:40
You guys should look into investigating hotel Conneaut in PA. I work at a Crystal Store and they run Psychic fairs every year where you're allowed to investigate and it's definitely haunted!!
Did anyone else notice at 16:00 that there is what looks like to be something walking by like their made of jelly? Really curious.
For 56:26 you should do the sturniolo triplets! Ive heard you guys have been talking about it but it would be the best collab ever!!! Love you guys lots❤
I LIVE IN ALTON ILLINOIS
You're not going to believe this but my name is Tina
Them and Shane Dawson would be insane
I love how in most of the sam and colby video's, when they hear a loud noise or a bang, they will stay silent for one minute or so and then sam goes  : "░H░e░l░l░o░?"  😂😂😅😅
Please hangout with kris and celina🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
i feel like leslie kinda distracted rae in the estes method by touching her arm and moving around so much tho. like we could have definitely gotten more if rae could focus without her surroundings distracting her 😕
Bro i want sam and coby to collab with the boys!!!!!!! They give off the same energy
I love yalls videos stay safe doing these video
Yall need lacy and clix for this
Now this is the proper why to end off 2023
You guys should collab with Ras.v
UNIVERSAL?!?!?! please stay true to yourselves. Don't be signing nothing crazy!
drunk colby cant hurt you: Drunk colby:
tbh the reason i think they don’t always get that much proof is because of their vibrations. Their life is publicized, they party, use social media, and they are well known. Even though they do investigate in low-vibration places, they make up for it by publishing their findings and gaining popularity. I feel like they should disconnect for a while from society to lower their vibrations, while doing research. Yes, they should make videos to document it however not post it until later in the future.
lokey should bring smii7y and kryoz
It doesn’t surprise me that the pool there is haunted Water Spaces like pools are like portals for the Paranormal so
I'm from UK and I'm watching this at 3: 33 am
I think Saint Michael came to protect you during the party thing, angels are known to give messages from others in future advance. Tats really special.
i made that note before watching and am shocked
OMG. I have literally been checking on this channel every day. I have missed you guys keep up the grate work love you guys. 2024 will be even better!!!😄
My fellas from Haunted Nights Steve and Dylan always get good evidence every time they investigate here. They have a couple of videos up about it. at 39:19 those things happened to Steve and Dylan too. Their cameras stopped working.
If you put the video on 37:59 I don’t know if those are lights or eyes in the room
Currently sick at the moment but still won't let sickness get to me when I'm watching a Sam and Colby video ❤
cant wait for hell week
people who have watched sam and colby for YEARS are only allowed to like this comment..💗
One of my Christmas ornaments is moving with no wind right now
ive had the flu these past couple days and all ive been doing is watching your videos. they make me feel better thank you love you guys
BRING LAURENZSIDE SHE LOVES THE PARANORMAL I SENT HER A DM BUT TAKE HER!
Where is the sam and colby and the boys colbay
I don't think they have drunk on camera in the entire year am i right?
Is it the type of chair that makes it think there’s a person sitting? I only wonder that cause the folding chair was the only one that didn’t show a person.
Our boys got sponsored by UNIVERSAL STUDIOS --- OHHHKAY YALL OKAY.
Mineral springs is such a crazy cool place. Thank you for giving us an amazing year Sam and Colby. You guys are awesome and I’m glad to be a part of the XPLR FAMILY!!
FINALLY WITH VALKYRAE AND LESLIE!! Now do one with Sykkuno and Toast or Lilypichu
sam is a girl 👍
i hope one day pearl is able to be free of her trauma and move on to a better more loving place where she is valued 🩵
please collab with the Sturniolo triplets 🙏🙏
You guys should do a video with twin paranormal😁
The one transition at the start of the video was wild😭💀 1:47
41:42 I was watching this part, and my little sister started screaming, bloody murder, and it horrified me she wouldn’t tell us why
Imagine having Sam and Colby play phasmaphobia
I love you Colby n Sam
Bro this is insane. I literally travel through Alton Illinois almost every day. I live like 15 minutes away. And I can say it’s like a giant battery.
Well at least while waiting for a new video I got all caught up!
My most awaited video ever. Rae and Leslie i am so happy to see you
Sam and Colby you should do a video with Sssniperwolf it would be so funny
You guys want a real cool reaction host, my Dude, Nick Hughes, from scared with Zowoki, wants to go spookin with you. I've been watching your posts for years, and watching them with scared with Zowoki for years. Thanks for all the scares you two.
Somebody I would love to see on a ghost hunt is Lauren Z side
on everything please. I wanna see you guys do a collab with jynxzi! That would be insanely funny!! Please
I like your videos then are so cool and so funny I love you Colby so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘
How r u gonna get my fav content creators on here when they make the videos?    Edit: I mean u guys btw
dan and reya. colby you r so fin
“Casual flex”
my sister bought ur merch from zumez for christmas so im happy i finally got merch after watching you guys all the way from the trap house and vines❤
I would love to see Garrett and Andrew go with Sam and Colby and explore a place, like see them do the Estes method I would scream. Or Julien Solomita and Chris Melberger! That’d be cool cuz they played phasmophobia too.
Ya’ll this is one of my favorite videos they’ve made because it was funny and scary but this one made me paranoid in my room because I’m an empath as well like I have 22 haunted dolls so I had to put them in the closet with the water temp and it was staying cold and we checked it and it was very low and we keep it hotter because it’s winter.
I wanna go investigate with them so bad
Nothing is more better then ending 2023 with a Sam and Colby adventure
i am so glad that colby got through cancer and i love your videos. wish the best for sam and colby. BEST YOUTUBEERS EVER!
Do a Part two❤❤❤❤
Video with Meta Psychics!
A blast to end 2023🎉🎉🎉 can’t wait for 2024
I love your videos OMG❤❤❤❤
And I lived close to where John W Gacy was executed at
dont turn around, he came behind and didnt want u to turn around, another is the reason he said money was because the ring was important because it can be sold for a lot of money :D
you should definitely do more videos with celinaspookyboo and callmekris but i also would love to see sssniperwolf on the channel. also congrats on getting sponsored by universal!
I live in Illinois 😬😬😬
being sponsored by universal is the biggest flex  ever
Omg i remember the HOSTING GAMEEE YAAA
You guys should go with HypeMyke and his crew! It could be insanely cool! Keep up the great work and Happy New Year! xx ❤🖤
When is the sturniolo COLLAB?
Or better yet! Either Universal Studios after gate closed or old graveyard on 15th avenue & washington in phx, AZ
Get jynxzi
Hey, this is funny to watch because I live in Illinois lol
Just hearing how pearl and her husband are trapped in this nightmare.... It makes me wonder if the attention brought to the abuse and how she died , the energy and the thought to this is what summons their energies there and that may be why they're trapped?
i want you guys to try it to toast and michael reeves!!
My little spirit friend kept swimming while I was watching this, and he won't explain it, but it was weird. This was such a cool video this was so funny and I really enjoyed it!
Y’all need a video with The Boys! They said they wanna go ghost hunting with you guys lol
Omg I didn’t even know this part of town was hunted I live in Mo Alton just a 20 min drive from were I am
Gonna watch this tomorrow but keep up the good work yall! I’m pretty sure we all have been wait for a vid but we’re pretty patient. Love your vids❤
I was documented for an apparition 5 of us witnessed up by Pearl's room a few years ago.
Sponsored by universal pictures? Wow the boys are moving up
please ghost hunt with trisha tana and brooke
Make more del coranado hotel videos please they are the best I have watched the video over ten times
When I’m 18 in a few years I wanna meet up with Sam and Colby and/or celina and kris and tell my paranormal stories and maybe talk to some ghosts…even the ones I’m with everyday
I was eating popcorn at the same time they said that.❤❤😊😊
@theboys you need to do this with them
16:01 watch the window by leslie. It could've been a draft or leslie herself but look at the black figure-ish thing swoop through.
Did anyone saw whole white eyes when they did the game and Colby was going up look at the right side door at 37:58 whatch
You guys need to do this with markiplier🎉
Sam and colby I loved this video could you do a ghost hunt with the sturniolo triplets and Larray pleaseee
sam ya gotta put a finger on top of the tip of the match 😟
i soo want to see the boys ( eddie, juicy, narrarator, mully, and joshdub) and sam and colby actually ghost hunt together
you should definitely come to upstate New York there’s some crazy cool places up here like Rolling Hills Asylum, The Sagamore Hotel, Burn Brae Mansion, and SO many more. it’s actually kinda scary? I believe Sagamore was once put in the top 10 most haunted places in the U.S. Super cool!!!
Please visit Abigail again
Me and my mom we're Youtube's ❤❤❤❤❤
Seeing this collab was still making me feel flabbergasted 😂 I did not expect this when it was announced and I love it so much! I’ve watched their content for so long.
get michael reeves tbh it wld be so funny
I'm 57 from New Zealand and a HUGE fan.  LOVE this one and those girls are SO sweet, definately get them back with you again.  Hope you all have a safe and happy new year 😍
Cooby saying night swim "is going to make you afraid of your pool" as if everyone had a pool in there house lol 😅🤣 or am I the only one with no pool 🥹😮‍💨
Oh you were so close
the way im watching this at night and i heard a bang (im alone inside my room)
My birthday is November 2! In Brazil Indiana 1860s cemetery go there please.
I don't know a creator you guys should calab with buuuuuuuut I know that you guys should come back too AUSTRALIA  Specifically brisbane like if u agree
Jerome, AZ haunted hamburger at night!
Valkyrae clearly has clairsentient abilities.
You guys always bring me out of a bad mood, i just tested positive for COVID-19 and I'm excited to see whats in store in this video, Also just an idea in Corpus Christi theres a huanted aircraft carrier the USS-Lexington that was targeted in pearl harbor.
The hosting game? Bringing back stuff from the trap house
Did anybody see the eyes in the black room at 37:55 ?
I’m so glad that there is a zumiez in Puerto Rico bc everything online is sold out. But sadly I coudlnt buy any merch bc my parents didn’t let me :(

Great video !
Ft - April Fooze & Ray Mond
Bring @Caspersight on an investigation 😂👍🏽☝️💯
ALTON??? That’s literally a half hour away from me!!!
I love you sam and colby  and I love your videos ❤😊❤😊🎉🎉
I saw xplr merch at zumiez before you announced it was there, I saw it and started dying, took a picture of the pink ghost hunting hoodie / tee and posted it on my story, sad yall didn't notice it
LETS GOOO ALL MY FAVE YOUTUBERS IN ONE VIDEO!!!!!
Happy New year! Thank you for all the amazing content this year.. I'm so stoked for what's to come! Had some interesting dreams about you two, Kris and Celina.. Be interesting if some of it shows up in your videos.. Dun dun duuuun... Well met and blessed be<3
Nobody mentioned how excited Lou was to cheer 🥂😏😁😅
Ok, so I have it paused at 37:05 and they just said "welcome in"  I don't know what type of spirits will come in later, but 2 things, 1) Colby technically struck that third match and it didn't light, 2) the "Practice" match would be sam's third match and that means that both attempts of the third match didn't light until some time passed, so I am thinking there will be negative spirits, we will see though.
I LOVE SAM AND COLBY 💜✖️
at 1:05:31 when Rae said “ya he said that right after u asked that” but I thought they weren’t supposed to be able to hear anything🤔 her face said it all
You would think being professional ghost hunters they would know about one of the most popular ghost hunting games (Phasmophobia)
BRO FUCKING UNIVERSAL SPONSORED YALL!?!?!?!
Can you send me happy birthday on March 27th
If you go with jay from kubz scouts I'll cry bc that's my childhood coming together
Wow a universal sponsor! That’s dope!! Congrats 👏🏻👏🏻
y'all here's a exploration site in utah thats actually down the road from my house its called to bigelow hotel and 14 people have died in it from it first opened in 1927 and the most haunted floor is the 11th floor with reports of screams and cries being heard the elevator randomly stopping and partial to full apparitions being seen at witches hour and on the 9 floor people in the 19 hundreds report having people jumping and the only "survivor" said in a report before he died was he was throw out the window there's more info if u just search it up but yea but there's also ghost towns and other haunted locations like kay's cross and one I recommend is the rio grande depot with a very popular entity named the 'purple lady'
God you two were in Illinois, not in Chicago, and I STILL missed you. Gosh y’all better just come check Macomb out so I can meet y’all
16:03 is it just me, or does it look like a shadow figure shot across the window?
It was a angel. I could see you take juicy
Best birthday gift ever a epic sam and Colby video
i think jschlatt would be perfect for a video
it’s november in this video???
Did anybody notice a shadow of a man that looks like it was standing up next to Leslie when the man was talking about Pearl?
Bring the boys from Australia
carol baskin killed her husband threw a rock at him
You guys are the best ghost hunter
I think the “tomb” after they left the basement meant that Carol, Harry, John, and Tina were saying “see you in the tomb” which, if im right, is really sweet 🥰
“What was the guys name?!?” Colby: “Micky!😀😃😁😆”
i love this video love more mystery murder case it is intersecting it would be great if lucas and marcus collab with you all in a video   .
Omg I can’t believe that this is the last vid of 2023!🥰🤘
If u a real Sam and Colby fan u watch this shit at night
Darn I must be old I watch these ghost videos all the time but I have no idea who these 2 girls were of they were quite hilarious though
I’m going by to zumiez on my birthday! It’s Jan 2nd!!🥳 p.s. love y’all ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Have you guys ever noticed that EVERY building or city is the most haunted?
Leslie was more active then the spirits
Love your guys videos, so informative. I would love the possibility to maybe collab in the future! 🙌
They all definitely hooked up after lol
I’ve been waiting for this collab!!
vibe radar lol
Can you imagine if Cody and Satori were there holding hands at this moment: 34:30 ?! 😅😂😂😂 The sounds of all the spirits clamouring over each other stomping in!
KallmeKris And CelinaSpookyBoo
The owners posted a picture of them on Facebook and I saw it on my birthday. They were there on my birthday and I didn’t get to see them. (I’m like 5 mins away from Alton too)🥲
we need valkyraeXNiki ghost hunting with sam and colby
I hope Leslie and Rae can do this again. I love them so much ❤❤❤
I did not expect this at all. Its like having a marvel cross over in a movie
Sam and colby lanaraee is live she said is your crush
you guys literally made my year and you guys should make a video with Kat , Amanda, Kris and Celina. i love it so much when you guys make videos together
How to hand up if you noticed William at the back of the pool   room.  Me:✋🏼
I'm leaning this in school right now I'm leaning about the 1920s
These videos are so amazing, keep up the amazing work for next year! Happy New Year Sam and Colby and have an amazing 2024!
I would luv to see u bring @layze with you. Or @snerrix. And go to las Vegas maybe lol. Idk what creepy places are there.  Buttttt luv yalllllll

Catacombs in Paris !!
Hopefully we see OTV and other streamers with Sam and Colby this 2024!! Fingers crossed!! :) happy new years everyone!🎉👻
you guys need to get Brittany Broski out. it would be so funny
i loved this video so much.

I would like to see you guys and The Boys do a video together!! Love you guys and keep making amazing content!! ❤️
"first time seeing a haunted pool".... queen mary pool?
13:09 Yo…I just had the weirdest Deja vu where I saw this part in my dream and now I’m watching it. Woah-
You guys should go to the al Capone hotel
This was a great video thank you all
Hello bring the house gang we haven't see them in a while in a vid it would be like the old days
I JUST GOT UR MERCH A ZUMEIZ TODAY !
ARE THOSE TO LADIES SINGLE?..IF SO YALL SHOULD JUMP ON THAT...😊
please get the @ sturniolo triplets and @ larray together in a video and i would LOVEEEEE to see @Tana Mongeau in one too! i think it's be so fun and funny
AT 11:29 MINUTES THE GUIDE DUDE (I forgot the name..) HAS THE SAME FLASHLIGHT AS MY BROTHER AND DAD-
Istg William and Cassie? What kind of fnaf reference. And it was during her birthday too? Great. Live laugh love it. I love watching y’all’s vid
I loved this vid amazing
Those people made the fnaf movie
im not gunna lie...I have been pretty disappointed with the videos lately. I feel like most places yall go now are mostly only about the history and not really any paranormal stuff happening like in past videos. AND along with this, the videos are taking MONTHS to come out. I dont mean any offense by this, just my own personal opinion and how ive been feeling about the videos. I still love yall, been watching yall since vine days lol maybe this will help in a sense of feedback from me. LOVE YALL BOTH. if I can give suggestion...go to jefferson, texas. There are 3 hotels in that small town that are haunted AF. would be a great series! <3
A collab with the @sidemen would be amazing.
Yesss y'all back
Oh my gworlssss!!! So excited to watch this!!!
Rae and leslie need to return they are like Sam and Colby fem version
That  girls hat is so cute
13:36 colby is so me 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
do @markiplier next
i got a tshirt from zummies!!! love you guys
I would really like Oompaville and Kris to be on Sam and Colby’s channel rn oh my god
i just wanna know was i the only person who saw that black figure pass by them in the beginning of the hunt when they were going to take a shot just 10 seconds before they said that.
Almost 1 million views in not even 8 hours is INSANE
Ahhh I live like 10 mins from there that's awesome!!! My uncle has done several investigations here, had alot of evidence, I'd love to go by just driving in the town of alton is always chilling !!!
unpopular opinion, they are indeed not pyramids but mounds instead.
Hey Sam and Colby this is Luke I have watched your videos for years and my dad is from Alton and I am surprised that it is considered one of the most haunted towns in America
THE ESTES METHOD WAS INSANE 😭
Come to Wisconsin next!!!! So many fun and scary places to visit!!!  And I would love to see you guys here!!!
Colby looked over this shoulder like 5 times during the ritual
That was awesome and I hope that you have a very happy new year
❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm a big fan and my sister    ty for making. Your   vid
LEGIT ALTON Receiving recognition for being spooky finally
can we just take a moment to realize that UNIVERSAL PICTURES sponsored them i mean that  just shows how far that come
Bro plz visit Fresno ca
They should do another collab where they play phasmaphobia with Rae and Leslie.
Are we all ignoring colby completely turning around at 41:53?
@Twinparanormal
I miss urs vibs bro why url dont post everyday like before anyway happy new year 🎉
I like when KallmeKris & Celinaspookyboo join in the fun with Sam & Colby. Lol 💯🫶🏼
good video
how could you not love sam and colby?
Bro every time y’all would talk about heading to the pool I keep getting an Ad for free crystals
Broo u were in Illinois 😭 and I didn't see u 😭 damn
Love ending the year with sam and colby
Y’all would make a good collab…
This is just a theory but what if the chairs are ghost that’s like the girl and guy who touches hands and arms and does the alphabet and the ghost taps the floor for the letter they are trying to talk about, what if they are like them people but ghost form and only way they can talk is with someone sitting in the middle seat and the equipment that tells the words they are using. It’s just. A theory and I bet Sam and Colby won’t read this 😅, cuz this momma ain’t nobody special but a momma to a 1 year old Handsome boy 💙.
@Twinparanormal
You didnt let pearl go 😢 you said goodbye to george but not her…… Leslie tried to let her go because of the time period they are from only a man can set her free from that session
Sam and Colby x   twin paranormal
I kinda wanna see you guys take the boys because they are just so funny and i think they would enjoy it because they went through the same thing you guys did and they maybe want to see if its true. Eddie vr, narrorator, jucy, josh, and muly
Currently in the hospital after almost dying but can't stop that Sam and Colby grind 💪
my aunt loves hunted things and places she actually lived in Alton Il but moved to Belleville works as a person who deals with dead bodies and stayed a night at another hunted place in Alton. She moved completly out of the state this year to be closer with family though.
What if it was the angel michael?
Universal studios? ?! Sam and Colby are moving up in the world !🌎
with Wyatt.
🎉HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE 🎉
I wanna see y’all with twin paranormal next
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!
I need them to do a video with Stephenie soo
I check your channel every day to see if you made a new vid you guys made my day today❤❤❤
The collaboration I never knew I would get or needed. Love Rae and Leslie!!!
love watching there videos at night !
@twinparanormal
im not an orb person usually but at 40:02 sis y’all see that orb behind colby when he lifted the doll??
45:06 is when the spirit box said Michael then at 51:50 Colby talks about Micheal. At the end I wish y’all would have switched & talked to the couple. That was so spot on to bad even though she wasn’t sure if she was hearing words she should’ve said them anyways. I bet it would’ve been even more explosive 🧨
OH MY GOSH YALL POSTED ON MY BIRTHDAY 🎈🎂 WHAT A GIFT FR !!
I would volunteer for this cus I’m young and I could have played with cassie😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
I'd tag @theboys
"so if it works, we all say 'welcome in'" "what happens if it doesn't?" "i don't know😅"  dawg💀
“I came from behind” …I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT THAT
Bring in Mackenzie Marie and Kelsi Davies!
holy sh*t, grats on the big sponsor!
Omg this was the funniest and most fun to watch video!!! The collab has to be my favorite watching my favorite streamers with my favorite YouTubers was surreal. Thank you again guys for this amazing vid
YALL ARE IN ILLINOIS?!
When yall doing ghost hunting with fans again?
Wait you guys should invite Preston
37:57 if you look when colby turned the corner you can see two lights that looks like eyes peeking out from the corner
Please visit to india❤
I wabna see ishowspeed and rug with sam and colby
😂 ❤
I’m from this area!!!! it was such a big deal when you guys were filming here i’ve been waiting for this episode!!
the estes method conversation was wild.
2am gang  👇
It'd be cool to see you guys explore the Indiana State Sanitorium. My grandparents and I uncovered a lot when we went there. The experience was crazy and I'd 100% would go back.
Fr so happy about this video
37:58 it looks like a set of eyes looking at them in the door on the right
U guys should take Tubbo on an adventure bc u already took tommy and jack on one
Excellent 👌
You guys should've took Amanda to see pearl and George
Fun fact : My mom was an event planner and was setting for an event at mineral springs. She was walking around the room when she felt a hand around her neck and she began to choke. Ever since she told me that story I started to fear mineral springs mall.
Sam and colby back again im so happy!!!
I personally think a Markiplier/Ethan and Sam and Colby crossover would be EPIC!
The fact that Leslie and Rae is on this channel, is like insane, I love their horror games, what a good collab
Sam and colby got people like the boys asking to collab yet here they are collabing with people like Valkyrae and fuslie 💀
I kinda want to go with some ghost hunting influencers just to see if its actually real. Like, I believe in ghosts and things like that but I want to see if the guests are lying or something for content purposes, like if there are actually tricks and things to make places look haunted. I honestly don't think that Sam and colby would do something like that, but my family is skeptical 😂
You know it’s gonna be a good day when Sam and colby upload
At 11:08 you can see wet foot prints one the floor
There’s this other time where my siblings were in the living room and I was by myself in our room and out of nowhere I screamed causing them to go to the room and ask what happened and the only thing I was “my friend” but I was alone the whole time
i feel like u guys shuld make a video with Kelsi Devis
Leslie and Rea had such a fun vibe
This is 35 minutes away from me
I like how the girls huddled next to Colby when they get scared. He is clearly the protector.
Thank yiu guys for this year you have made me laugh and smile and I love you guys so much ! You make me smile at my lowest and this year has been a blast with yiu guys ! And I would really like to see you colab with the sturniolo triplets ! The girls handled this so well !! Proud of the girls and proud of you 2 for coming this far !!
Amazing can’t wait for the amazing videos in this coming year❤
Let's collaborate
The crazy part, I was checking out Pi chatbot and mentioned watching Sam and Colby. Pi went off about what a great channel they had.
Fun episode. I love Leslie and Rae they’re hilarious and fun streamers!  Something that I would feel like would help is if you guys include the Estes Method’s audio in the video so we can hear what it’s saying.  Not saying you’re faking it but it is easier to verify what you think you hear in that radio sweep(and it is a whole lot more convincing and compelling).
bro yk what would be crazy? is if coryxkenshin were to be in the next vid💀
you guys should go to this place in scotland called overtoun bridge. over 600 dogs have jumped off randomly, due to its haunting from the lady in white.
the fact that all four of yall were in my state i’m so excited!!!
You should collaborate with the boys
at 55:51 when the alice box said tina am I the only one who thought about rae and leslie’s friend tina??
Idk why but this was a boring episode tbh.  Too much giggling from them and I didn’t feel like it was a genuine investigation 😢 no disrespect but common Sam and Colby … waited weeks for a new post and I was pretty disappointed in this one :( please no bashing on me from others. Just wasn’t their best investigation:(
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS COLLAB FOR FOREVERRR
Sponsored by Universal?! Truly don’t believe I’ve ever seen any channel sponsored by such a high profile company before!! Yay!! Well done! You’ve been noticed by the bigguns, and they want you to promote them. Seriously never ever seen that before. Congrats guys, one hell of a Christmas present. Please consider coming back to UK, but to the Highlands, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. You won’t be disappointed by what you find up here.
THATS MY TOWNN I LOVE ATOWN
im amazed you got rae on this even playing horror games she will jump halfway across the room lol
hi sam and co oby i love u guys!
i spent my 1-hour of the last day of the year non-skip, just to watch Rae & Leslie playing phasmophobia irl lmao
As Colby keeps looking behind him in the pool!!!😂
I’m running to my nearest  Zoomiez nowwwww
Bro I live right next to this place. I live in Jerseyville.
GO TO THE LEMP MANSION
That place is literally 2 hours away from my house and I had no clue about it 😮
next year do a new video with larray and twaimz\issa and play the midnight man game [like if you agree]
39:03 I don’t know why but Colby going “what?” while slowly turning without moving his neck was hilarious to me
OMG GUYS ILLINOIS? THATS ONLY 1 HOUR FROM ME
@AMP squad would be funny
please bring airrack and ryan trahan. would be best reaction
I REALLY WANT TO WATCH NIGHT SWIM 😁😁 lol
You all should go to Stephen’s College in Columbia Missouri. I went to college there and me and many of my classmates experienced different paranormal things. There is a several goes throughout the different buildings on campus. One being Sarah Jane in senior hall and Maude Adam’s in the theater. And don’t even get me started on the dorm ghosts.
This was another amazing year sam and Colby, your content never fails on both Chanel’s I can’t wait for 2024 to see your new and next amazing adventures! I love you guys. This is my 7th year with you guys! I love your content and you guys are so amazing keeps going and doing what you do cuz it’s truly amazing.❤
i saw sam and colby merch at the mall to today it was so cool!!!
Is it just me but in the window of 16:00 it's like something is passing
I'm might be able to watch the movie, but I am able to watch my favourite youtubers
Can’t wait to see this collab in the future !!
Sam just sucks at lighting matches
Starting at 41:45 Colby keeps turning his head around??
Colby is so fine 😍😍😍
I love you guys so much!! I got my first pieces of merch for christmas and I almost cried!! I got the hell week exclusive Currently Fighting Demons purple shirt, The Conjuring House hell week poster, and an XPLR hoodie!! Never stop doing what you two do!!! <33333
“7 minutes! That’s like 4 popcorn bags.” -Valkyrae 2023
Jesus universal studios wth

Well, if u got THEM to do a collab with, I'd love to see Jacksepticeye and Gab Smolders on this channel

We should just appreciate all the hard work they put into their videos they are also SUPER FUNNY!!!
This looks like so much fun!! I love @FilmCopper and I think he would love to go on a ghost hunting adventure with you guys! He gives golden retriever energy, and is super goofy and fun. He's done multiple ghost hunting videos in the past and I'd love to see him go with you guys!!!

Happy early birthday Colby and happy late birthday Sam
"do you guys hear the rem pod outside?"- What should've been Colby's last recorded words before going to jail 💀
Not the collab I thought would happen but I’m down for it lmao
green sweater is kinda annoying ngl
I love Sam and Colby so much, they make me so happy and make my day 😊❤
im tagging mr beast so the next video is with mr beast XD
Its nice to see y'all cleansing after an investigation and actually documenting it for us to see. That definitely makes us feel better about what u do in these haunted places. Staying safe is first priority. Well done guys and gals....Well done.  Love u. Merry Christmas and Happy New year ❤❤❤❤
love my girls sm they're so funny lmao we need leslie back tho i feel like she could do more stuff
Night swim is on my birthday:D
i want to see Sam and Colby play phasmophobia.
Sam and Colby I think you should take internet city somewhere
Who likes to see ha sisters to be with Sam and Colby cause Im a big fan of Sam and Colby and the ha sisters like they need to experience this
Omg love the video but who thinks Sam and Colby should do some videos in Australia?
I CANT BE THE ONLY ONE THAT HEARD RAE SAY "My vibrator is off". At like 26:25 This severely caught me off guard 😂😂🤣🤣💀

❤❤❤❤❤
@moe sargi
this video shows me that in the after life you could redo what u have done while u was alive or u could be trapped in your old life by a curse and i feel so bad for the wife in the married couple because she has to go through so much after she lost her life
early
This GTA roleplays a bit different…
I CANNOT BELIEVE that you guys just ghost hunted 20 minutes from the college I go to  😭 that’s crazy
I'll go on the next trip
it would be so funny if you guys too @sinjindrowing ghost hunting 😭
BRO WHATS THE ENDING MUSIC CALLED??
I want to see the Meta Psyckicks to go on an adventure with you for 2024
Gacy lured young guys to his house and drugged and abused them,then killed them. Buried them under house and covered it with concrete. He lived outside of Chicago. The house was recently torn down.
Universal? Are one of these kid's dads an exec.over there?  That's a pretty big hook-up.
Love you guys
AYYY THEY POSTED AGAIN!!

@Mrbeast
at time stamp 16:01 something goes past the window i dont know what it is or if it colby moving but i saw and thought i should point it out
I stupidly decided to watch this at 2am 😀 biggest mistake have ever made
The ghost waved back in pearls room.  ❤
Complete shot in the dark - but the guide talking about a guardian angel last November, the Alice box saying Michael and Pray, kinda leads me to think of the Archangel Michael
I CANT WAIT FOR YOU TO COME TO AUSTRALIA YOU HAVE TO GO TO PICTON OR CAMDEN THEY ARE KNOWN TO BE HAUNTED 💖
As a medium i love your videos and make me want to do ghost hunting myself i just dont have none of the tech like you do cuz if i said what i saw nobody would belive me just like they dont now
I been waiting
LOVE YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST ❤️
So happy been waiting so patiently for this🙏😅😂
This was my first priority when I woke up...
My favorite chaotic duos in one video is a blast! Thanks for a great year Sam and Colby, and the roomies! 🎉 Btw, I love Sykk! ❤ But Rae and Leslie were the most jumpy of ‘em all 😅😂🤣 I was laughing and scared and then laughing then got satisfied. 😊 Been waiting for this vid since I saw their post 😌 Happy New Year, everyone! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 see you next year in the comment section 😂
Now we need sykunno and miyoung next!!
Never thought I'd hear a spirit say on God lol 😂

43:48
I was waiting soo long for a video... but Leslie and Rae is a +++🔥🔥🔥🔥

This is the end of journey in 2023 I hope it getting scarier on 2024😆
Y'ALL ARE SO CLOSE TO WEAR I LIVE😁😁😁
No one gonna talk about how Colby threw us into his area as a scene switch  …. 💀😰 1:47
dream team up next
I would love to see you guys go to the Island Of Dolls in Mexico, it is known to be a very haunted place that is covered in dolls! I would love to see you take Niki, Kris and Celina on an adventure somewhere in the same video or in different videos! I would also love to see you take KREW on a trip somewhere with you guys because I feel like it would be a fun video! Side note KREW includes Funneh, Rainbow, Draco, Lunar, and Gold. ItsFunneh is the official YouTube channel for KREW and all of the members of KREW are siblings. (KREW'S real names are Kat, Betty, Allen, Wenny, and Kim La.) Please consider doing any of these things!
SAM AND COLBY POSTED ON MY BIRTHDAY
I Love Rae and Leslie's Energy   This is a really good Group though I would Love To see all of them again in another vid!
How do I get in on your investigations. I have abilities and would love to help out
I think it'd be Awesome! To see Jacksepticeye and Markiplier on here with Sam and Colby! Anyone else think similarly, like this comment..
1:46 Hilarious transition! You guys never fail to make me laugh! 😂😂
Take @finatic that would be hilarious
Rae is beyond gorgeous 😍
I think 2024 gotta revisit the Sally house
I love your Videos ❤❤❤❤
Sam and colby u should investigate the beverly halls family their house has been haunted
I want them to go to the conjuring house and experience satori
Tbh I'm more scared bcuz of the sounds and random images sam and colby put up on their videos😥🤧  Kinda unrelated but im more paranoid this year than i had ever been my whole life :')
MICKEY MOUSE
Colby looked back 3 times😂
I WISH I COULD COME WHITH YOU GUYS IT LOOKS SO FUN
Last vid of 2023 love you guys you’ve accomplished so much❤
the movie is a day before my birthday!?
I'm not even going to lie this video made me tear up a bit from pure empathy with the stories and Rae and Leslie. This is the first Sam and Colby video I've ever seen, and even knowing Rae and Leslie are okay bc they've have streams since this was filmed, I was still so scared for them. I felt like most of the spirits felt nice exect for George, who, if he came to the party, could've been messing with the equipment. Even more Harry, Carol, Tina, and Dawn only said 'scary' stuff as they were leaving and they said "We're going to Pearls room", so it made me think that was them giving a warning for Pearls room, anyways this video was wild as someone who's never seen anything from Sam and Colby before. GOod job everyone!
joshdub
Broooo i missed this😭 I hope you guys had an amazing 2023 I’ve been waiting ages for you to post lol
First video that popped up on my YouTube page
I grew up in that area and used to go into that cave with the dragon on it and party late at night. It is an uneasy place to be at night forsure. if you go on top of that cave and go down a few miles you can see the giant wooden cross thats been there forever as well.
so much has happened this year that its surreal ngl bad things and good things but in the end there is always something good awaiting and everything pays off you guys have gotten me through so much and i hope you have a amazing rest of the year also everyone fr needs a friendship like your guys your guy's friendship is so sweet
I’m so jealous, I really want to go ghost hunting. It looks so much fun
Love the content per usual. I’m a certified hypnotist and think you folks would benefit greatly if you have a mentalist/hypnotherapist during the videos to get you into a somnambulistic trance prior to Estes Method. Love to be of service.
30:00 ❤😊
Hey Sam and Colby, you probably won't see this message, but I hope you do. I think there's a ghost been following me for a few years, I have a EMF reader, and I used it in my room, it randomly starts going off, which means something. I've moved houses, moved states, but it's still with me, I can't fully guess if it's a good spirit or bad. But I can sense that it's a little child, or a teen, or feeling like a woman. Please let me know if you can give me stuff to help, and give me things that you use, that i can buy, to try to interact with this kind spirit. Thank you.  Kind regards, SevenThrone
Hello Sam and Colby I love your videos but I have a really big question I've been watching y'all for a while now and just a few years before I started to watch y'all I was seeing a shadow figure it had oblong horns one being long than the other and both being curved in to each other it stood about about 5-6 feet tall and now I'm starting to see it again should I do anything cause I feel watched when speaking of Shadow People and can't stand to have a door facing me while I sleep or chill due to such feelings. Should I do anything to help??
i have never heard of universal sponsoring a youtube
LIKE THE COMMENT IF YOUR FROM ILLINOIS <<<<
16:00 there is shadow at the 3 windows
My house
imagine markiplier being in a sam and colby video... its a need
Yall should bring sykkuno and disguised toast. 👇who all agrees
I claim no negative energy from this video
Oh, you should do a video Gypsy Rose
1:47  WAT WAS THAT TRANSITION  COLBYS BALLS?! 😭😭😭
Amazing video! I think another good collab would be Peyton and cam off of the ‘you should know podcast’ or another video with kris and celina! Love y’all ❤
Not the cleansing IN the pool🤣
Named wIllAM,  got me dying 💀
Why did colby do that first transition??? HUHHH🫢🫣😬🫨
Wtf is her problem with the girl with the white hat
you should try getting someone like coryxkenshin on one of these videos it would be really funny to see
Rae's Height difference is So obvious LMAO
ive been waiting for u 2 too make a new video im such a big fan im buying a subscription for xplr club soon
“We’ll come back eventually…😳 yeah after 7 minutes… 😳 I’m literally not doing anything… 😳” had me dying🤣🤣 48:59
Strangely everything in this video was in my dream ☠️
At 41:43 Colby turned his head to his shoulder
I would personally love to see you guys do some type of Australian ghost hunting video and maybe take someone like Lazarbeam and/or Loserfruit with you guys! Alongside that, I think CourageJD would be hilarious in one of these
Sam and Colby + The Boys collab PLEASE🙏🙏
Ima try to find the store they were talking about and buy the sweater👍🏽♥️
There Is a queen Mary movie
You guys need to bring Sapnap and Karl!
Rae, Leslie, Celina and Kris just saying best video  ever ❤
the boys are calling yall to do investigation together in australia in their last video!!
Liza Koshy and josh peck and lele pons and lily Singh and Joey Graceffa and Addison Rae and Emma chamberlain and David dobrick and jesser too to go ghost hunting with Sam and Colby
Yayyyy Rae and Leslieee
🎉🎉🎉🎉 HEY YOU GUYS ROCK 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I want to see @jacksepticeye do this
I would love to see you bring Bailey Sarian!!
Hi Sam & Colby. This was soo amazing. To go to a haunted area and experience such a place with two gorgeous ladies is really amazing. God Bless you all and have the most joyous New Year. You two ended this video in a good note. The two of you are awesome. And this is coming from your fan who's 63. God Bless again. Take care. Love you both. HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎊🎉🥳MY FRIENDS. MARI'A.🤗🤗❤️❤️🤗🤗❤️❤️🥳🎉🎊👍👍👍👍💙💙💙💙ALSO I HOPE YOU HAD AN AMAZING CHRISTMAS WITH YOUR FAMILY. 🎁🎄
sam and colby sponsored by universal hell yeah!! so excited to see night swim :D love y'all can't wait to watch
You guys should really bring markiplier muyskerm and lordminion777 on a ghost hunting trip It'd be so funny and amazing
Yea people think these are for hanging pigs but...no,colby:yea idiots😒
Why did Colby just transition into his d*** bro? Look at 1:47
WE NEED YOU TO TAKE THE STURNIOLOS OUT GHOST HUNTING
Been watching yall for years and still love yall just get better and better
how about a collab with The Boys? The Boys have recently been getting more and more into ghost hunting, and even stated in their most recent video (which was about them ghost hunting in the haunted lighthouse) that they would like to collab! blow this comment up so Sam and Colby could potentially see this!! also sorry if this comment for some reason shows up twice.
You should bring Georgenotfound and dream to a haunted location
I'd suggest the movie After Death, the new movie that came out. I think you guys would be very interested about it.
Sturnilo triplets pls
Totally geeking they brought back the hosting game one more time!! ❤❤
Finally a new video!!!!
supporting from philippines!!🫶
50 mins in and this is hard to watch. Wheres the investigation? Nothing but a stupid soundtrack in the back the whole time and everyone joking. Fun to watch skipping through I guess.
UNIVERSAL STUDIOS?! Jeez
HI!!! I love y'all am early
12/31/23 (the last 123123)
37:56 there are two people poking out on the right hand side and you can see their eyes!
When talking with Lou, it seemed like he was mostly replying when the girls were the ones asking the questions lol  38:06 Rae sitting against the wall but still giving it a bit of space so they'd still stand behind her 😂  Edit: Being left in the slaughterhouse was intense but they did well, and it seemed the spirits' response was friendly. In Pearl's room, that was a fascinating exchange. Maybe both of them were hearing the same things except Rae's mind wasn't as open to paranormal stuff to begin with. I like that they were also responding to the two's questions apart from the end where they end up arguing with each other. I thought they'd want to do it again if it weren't for the ritual and the pool. Awesome video 💯
the way i was looking forward to collab with them that would never come true lol
“NaMeD wILlIaM”
TAKE HAILEE AND KENDRA OUT
The next vid   “Spending a month at the conjuring house”
I love your videos you guys make me so happy and laugh uncontrollably and please tell Kris and celena hi
WTF U WERE ABLE TO GET SPONSORED BY THE UNIVERSAL COMPANY?? you’ve both come a very long way, we are so excited to see more! <3
46:00 maybe michael was otw to gag city!
The Boys and Sam and Colby
Thank you all so much for this year. You guys helped me so much getting up this year, im so thankful. Just thank you guys!❤
Honestly seeing rae and Leslie colab with you two was so great to see. I've been watching rae and leslie stream for YEARS, and I've been watching you two for probably just as long. Ghost hunting has been a passion of mine for probably 20 years now my mom used to take me places like old town san Diego and many other haunted places in so cal as a kid so seeing you guys take some of my favorite streamers on this experience was an honest to God pleasure to see. Not to mention they both took it very serious. It kinda gets annoying when people come and troll so much they make the whole experience into a joke. But they did very good. They didn't disrespect the spirits, they didn't troll, and they followed all instructions given. I would love to see more youtubers\streamers colab with you.
the flashlights aren't real when they get cold they turn on and then the light heats it up and turns it off its not a spirit
@vixella should do one with y’all
Can you please bring LZside
I would love a ghost video with Black Rose and the boys ❤❤❤❤
Maybe Sam you just aren't good with lighting matches? 🤣🤣.
YEAHHHH
I'd like to see you invite subscribers to throught 2024 to investigate with yall and maybe with Kris, Nate, Celina, and Seth all together... Wish y'all would do something in Missouri too if you get the time next year. I love you guys!❤❤❤❤
RAE AND LESLIE ARE SO FUNNY LMAOOOOOOO THEY DID GREAT
watching this video at exactly 11:28 pm
when you guys invited the spirits to the host game at the pool, the spirit box said "Chair". Maybe George or Pearl were with you the entire time(sorry for the edit it made me stop typing)
There are lots of ladies in (invert colors)
@samandcolby Happy Early Birthday Colby!🎉
41:51 Colby looks over his shoulder
I am the 75,000th like on this video at 6 hours 679,757 views.🎉
Hey Sam and Colby! Could you guys please invite ItsFunneh/KREW next time? I would literally freak out if that would happen!
JANUARY 5TH IS SUDDENLY MY FAVORITE DAY??
Sponsored by uni is big great vid
I CANT BELIVE I WAS ASLEEP WHEN THIS CAME OUT
That's actually kinda cool, the way I see it the Pearl was speaking through Colby primarily and the husband spoke through Rae. Perhaps because Colby's energy is known to be comforting and Rae would be a lot more vulnerable?
Take @ Twin Paranormal  with you next time 🤙
i loved this vid but every time they said stuff like "omg i played this online" or "this is just like phasamaphobia" i wanted to cry. it made me cringe so hard at how someone can be that chronically online. 💀
November?
Joe Bartolozzi would be such a funny collab
Why am i watching this at 3 am 😅
I love you guys
I love you guys
Colby is like the best conduit for the Estes method. I think Colby was coming through for Pearl and Rae for George though. So weird, or Colby had both coming through at times.
in the pool the alice box said micheal as a name then before the 7 mins sam said the shadow figure was called micheal. i got chills, what if he was at the gathering and joking round with them
I love you guys
SAM & COLBY PLEAAAAASSEEEEE BRING ON OOMPAVILLE AND KALLMEKRIS PLEAAASEEEE
Not gonna lie but Sam and Colby are kinda 😘😘😘
Would you take johnnie guilbert ghost hunting
As a big fan of the paranormal this was hard to watch, I love these girls but not here, they were so loud and obnoxious it was hard to focus on anything else. I love your guys videos so don’t come for me lmao
Sam does hosting ritual that he forgot this ritual supposed to be done alone 🤦 and the ghost is not happy when it done with so many people 🤦   The proof is when the two sticks didnt light 🤦
The basement area suddenly became a fan meeting venue 😂
I love you guys
The match thing was kinda dumb
Around 2 minutes in Colby looks into the screen like he’s about to fight us viewers
Hey I love you guys so much I’m your biggest fan I which all videos that you post
U should bring someone like Mr beast or Markiplier
Sam and colby really need to get better guests, why they always end up bringing lame ass asian pick mes, bella poarch ruined the conjuring series and now this.
this video was so good, and terrifying 😅, probably my fave so far on this channel
SUPER THANK U FAM FOR A VERY INTERESTING HAPPY ENTERTAINING COOL SMART FUNNY EVERYTHING ELSE VIDEO U GUYS DID A  SUPER FANTASTIC JOB ON THE VIDEO N HOPE YOUR 2024 IS HAPPY FUN COOL EVEN FOR THE VIDEOS N OTHER THINGS TOO BIG TIME LOVE YA FAM BIG TIME
37:57 two pairs of eyes in the dark hallway to the right.
A Lobotomy was the term used for removing the crazy part of the Brain 🧠
that was so cool! thank u for a great year and awesome investigations. Colby im so glad u kicked cancers butt!! If u get a chance my little friend Shae Watts is a huge fan and shes been having a rough time, i know u get  a lot of requests and probably wont see this, which i totally understand. But if u could maybe shout her out and encourage her, that would mean the world. She could really use some encouraging words from anyone really, but especially u guys. Thanks for everything! Cant wait to see what u have in store for 2024!!
Never mind my favourite creator i would love to be able to do these investigations 😂 i love spooky stuff and ive had spooky stuff happen that i wish i could explain.
Wait i love them and there energy and they know niki so
im begging can you take fans out again and i also wrote something nice on kong phams vid with @samandcolby ive been watching for 5 yrs love yall!
I think yall should take up the boys' offer of doing something in Australia. y'all did collab a little during their reaction to the conjuring series, and I think that would be a fun video. Keep up the hard work, love yall
"AWHSBFJLASOIEWEJL"
i absolutely loved this collab
😎😎👍👍🕵‍♂🕵‍♂👻👻
Never thought you guys would come to Alton! That’s awesome, I’ve been here many times ☺️
finally yall did my town!!!
Amazing video Sam & Colby. Have a safe, happy, and healthy  New Year 🎉🎉❤🖤❤🖤🤟🫶🙏😇🥂🍾🍷🍸🍹🍺🍻
Omg I wana see @chrisrudnick
i love you both so much and i have so much of your merch i watch all of your videos from day one im so happy you have come so far i love youuuuuuuuuu
this was awesome video
I would just like to thanks Sam and Colby for being my therapist. I started watching yall in a couple months ago but yall have been so inspiring to me. THANK YOU SO MUCH  ❤ from Iowa (Once I started watching yall I realized that I drove past you guys when you were at the Valisca axe house. I was so sad I missed you 😮😅😂) Like if yall live sam and Colby
1:45 Sir did you crotch transition
If possible can you do the Krew/ItsFunneh they play creepy games on a game called Roblox (also I just realized the crescent hotel is in Arkansas and that’s a country I’ve been to)
Great video as usual!! Manifesting an awesome  new year 🎉
I’ve been past this place so many times, even stayed near it. I just never went inside or knew anything about it.
Need some more Haunted Nights and Sam and Colby duos!
You should have DannyPhantomexe join you guys on an investigation
Watching these guys play the hosting game is a huge throwback to their old videos and I missed it
valkyrae reminds me of alexa from alexa and katie
They question what they are doing then proceed to walk faster
I wish I could be apart of your vids
Yall are rich, yet you choose cheap cruddy whiskey???
At 1:06:01 it looked like something was watching y’all from the side walk outside the window, but it might just be me
I can't believe it valkyrae and Leslie went haunted place they did good job and they my favorite streamers all time valkyrae and Leslie have a good day and be safe and also Sam , Colby also have a good day and be safe your next haunted places good luck
at 37;57 second there is white eyes in the green door way that blinked
Never imagined id see this collab, but im not disappointed :O
I HAVE THE FLANNEL THAT SAM IS WEARING!!!!
Plz take jacksepticeye
Hey guys!! Alton IL.... awsome place!! You are close to the original exorcist house and the limp mansion... if your not too scared. Come across the river and visit a couple of the most haunted places in STL. I am a 100% believer because of my experiences ... but my girlfriend doesn't. Luckily she doesn't mind having your channel playing every night!    In the pool, the box did say Limp..... maybe it's telling you something!?
This is my town!!!! Eeeee I’m so exited
No one realized that coby looked behind him at 41:52 😮
Earlyyyy
I was so scared but how sometimes they make scary stuff funny is amazing keep up the good work sam and colby
OMG finally
I think it was so cute when when the girls were like hiding behind Colby
You if you can you could try and bring Laurenzside out! I think she would be fun to play with.
ANYONE WHOS LATE BUT STILL WANTS TO SAY HEY   V
When I hear the name Leslie I think of how badly Sam wanted that as a name lmao
Can y'all guest act mature at least one video
SAM AND COLBY IM GETTING MERCH ITS ON ITS WAY
I love Rae and Leslie! I really like Rae in 'The Family Plan'!! I'm so happy Sam and Colby brought them on!! Let's go!!!
My family lives in a house that was used as a hospital in both of the WW and we had nothing paranormal happen to us. I find it funny how everyone is saying woo ghosts are real. I just don't believe in this type of stuff, but find it really interesting.
Sam u look so much happier good look on u sam
TAKE THE STURNIOLO TRIPLETS
Sam and Colby... you should talk to Dakota Laden about his experience there at the Mineral Springs Hotel when he was working as a camera operator on Ghost Adventures. It's very scary!!😳😲😱🖤👻🖤👻🖤👻
OML I LOVED THIS VIDEO YALL!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SAM AND COLBY!❤ WE LOVE YALL!!❤❤ #COLLABWITHTHEBOYS! Those are the creators some of us would like to see collab with yall!
Go with 'Twin Paranormal' they've said previously that they tried getting through to yourselves team but  never got a response😫💖🇬🇧💖🇬🇧pwetty pweeeaaase😁😚
that party ritual reminded me so much of the midnight man
We gonna ignore colby lookin behind him during the hosting game@ 41:51
i cant really say my favorite creator becasue sam and colby are number 1 favorite creator
Man, im not gonna lie. This was probably one of the worst videos I've seen yall release in years. And i love rae and fuslie, so i thought it would be a dope collaboration. Idk the video felt so unsatisfying to me. Just felt like yall wasted time doing absolutely nothing.
Yay
@terrorizer  @Nogla pls pls
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Sam and colbyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
If I was a giant YouTuber, I really want you guys to invite me to your hunts one day lmao
Damn every time I look at the veiws it goes up
What a great video to end 2023. Happy New Year everyone! And Happy Birthday to Colby Brock!
colby and rae would be so cute 2gether :3
Cheers 🍷 drinking some wine to this ❤ can’t wait for more fun ! ❤ love you both Happy new year & hope you’re both well …sorry I don’t know you’re guests but hope they have a happy new years to thanks for joining the fun ladies ❤
That was insane that there wasn't that much activity like the conjuring house. I'm definitely going to buy the merch, there's 2 Zumiez stores (in 2 different malls) close to me. Also please bring Twin Paranormal in next year!
Ryan trahan/ Airrack/ MrBeast
Now that I think of it when he said “no option” I think it might’ve been a forced marriage
37:57 the doorway to the right????????????
I'm so happy Sam and Colby started incorporating a cleansing ritual at the end of their investigations.  And also, major props to the Zumies plug!!! As a longtime subscriber, I feel like a proud mama.  Well deserved boys!!!
sam sam sam sam sam sam
Sam and Colby are like a family tradition kinda... We were watching their older videos on Christmas even 😅😂 we love Sam and Colby for sure
I have ur murch!!!
Anyone else remember when Sam did this solo in the trap house? Throwback to his 3am challenge vids 🙌
Get markiplier to do a ghost hunt 😂
I was so excited when I saw that you guys posted! Keep up the good work!!
did anyone notice 16:01?
When Sam was lighting the matches it only lights once so I might be meaning there's a couple good spirits?
Sam and Colby please do a vid with Rambo please
Sam and Colby have always taught us one thing... always be scared of bugs!!
Can you imagine if it was Ray and Corps doing this 😂
On 37:57, there is a thing wtaching them...
Can you please make a new video
Really? A TWO!?!?!? LOL 😂😂😂
Omg the baby doll they used is the one in my friends and I YouTube channel ❤ Love your guys work keep it up! You bring smiles to people everyday ❤❤
at 16:00 wat is that shadow in the blanket on the wall???
41:50 colby keeps turning over his shoulder
40:04 bébé 😂
Pov unlocked a new frear sam and Colby's images that pop up I'm the middle of a conversation
There was a shadow at the window at 16:01 but im not sure if it is sam or colbys hands
I saw this on instgram and as soon as i saw it i screamed i was so excited 😂 me and my family dont claim any negative energy from this video ❤
Nights swims out on jan 5th in America but Jan 4th in nz so my bday😮 I’ll try see it a few days after my bday cause my bdays going to be busy since I’m going shopping a lot and I’m also getting my septum pierced🥳🥳😆
Talking about game I genuinely wonder if they gonna take that path lol  Not like fully but like once a while they stream or do a horror let's play lol
I have family in Alton! I had NO idea about the hotel! Totally going next time I visit!
Great night for watching a creepy video before bed.
You guys where 4 hours away from us 😅
Sam and Colby should totally get Mykie (Glam and Gore) to join them!
THIS WAS INSANEE!!! I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER VIDEOO!!
Hi Sam and Colby
16:00 - Anyone wanna help debunk the shadow in the window between the girls - nobody is infront of the camera light. https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxkdVkXTyEgF_YN-FtV-iQdOspAj8FgBjf?si=ZFhI9GO9uHibCbWI
Even though you two might not think mediums can't remote view a video (why would spirits be limited to the location you were in?), you should try to hit up Meta Psykicks Em and Liv! Amanda recently did videos with them so if you need someone to ask about, it would be her!
IVE BEEEEN WAITING FOR THISSS😂😭😭
Did anyone notice that when they were in the pool the spirit box said Michael and then after when they were in the basement, Colby said that the shadowman name could be "Michael"
wait dude wittley!!! Dis ep was so lit faweal, i splurged when i saw sam and colby :3
Love live serve nexxt please 🙏
Colby was quite the comedian in this episode, lowkey laughing my ass off😂
Ok so if you go to 24: 12 you can here a little girl say hi
The more and more I watch Sam and Colby they make me laugh so fucking hard and scare the shit out of me!!!But I love their channel and although sometimes I can't fall asleep as fast as normal because I've watched one of their videos I still think they are amazing and are some of the best Youtubers!!!❤❤❤I also loved this video because they got Valkyrae and Fuslie because they made it so funny as well,but I also oove when they go to places with KallmeKris and Celinaspookyboo!!!❤❤❤
when she said “i need a doctor” i got chills all over my body omg im so sad for Pearl
I’ve never been a this early
Is it bad that the video isnt scary.. its just the images that freak me out xD
Thank you Sam and Colby so much you made this year so much better for me
😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😢💔💔💔💔
My name is Cassie 🧍‍♀️
COLLAB WITH THE BOYS PLEASE
My Birthday is January 5😂
Rae and Leslie brought a sorta “holy shit I think I might die but I’m also having fun” vibe to the vid that was very entertaining 😂
I'd rather have a bottle in front of me then a frontal lobotomy 🤣🤣🤣🤣. I know I know it's a real knee slapper! Lol.
PLEASE COME to the old joliet prison in joliet IL, its about 4 hours from alton.
i remember the hosting game from the trap house, its been a while, good memories ❤
Take Artofkickz on a ghost hunt.
When they start investing the lobby and the two times it's says listen, it sounded like a woman say 'and Lou' and the second was just 'lou' but both where in a female voice. First one could of been Rae but not to sure  P. S I can't spell that man's name. Help
Can I be on your channel I love paranormal activity so much like you guys
AINTNOWAY did you see that?! LULW
Yo I went to zume at the mall and I got your merch
I kinda wonder if pearl would have came out more if someone directly talked to her and understood her pain, like if someone who had gone through the same situation as her if she would've been more comfortable to speak
You guys should bring the boys at some point
Y’all definitely need to go with Boze VS the world! She’s so funny and her personality with y’all’s would be AMAZING.
In 2024, please go with offlinetv because they form that youtube channel with content different
"he stole it"... he took pearls ring off her body
can u please take @lilypichu out here next
rae and les getting so excited everytime they get a reaction is so girly coded i love it
I feel like in the double Estes method when the spirits were talking about “money” and “nightmare” , I feel like they were trying to say: “give us a offering or we will make you have nightmares.” Like this if you agree so we can ask Sam and Colby if they have been having nightmares from this!
leslie's reactions were so entertaining 😭
alright dude, its 2:26 am.
I want to go there so bad but the person I want to go with is a scaredy cat.
Brooo the merch is in zumiesss!!?!?!?!!! Whatttttttttt
I work at a ice cream/ candy/ souvenir store in Laconia NH in the Weirs called Kellerhaus. It has been around since 1906 I think it’s haunted things fall off the shelves we have heard talking when customers were in the store/ area. There is a small graveyard next to the parking lot and I think that could have to do with the experiences but I think you guys should come and investigate that if the history is appealing at all.
Can u make a video with the Sturniolo Triplets next year ? I think it would be funny
YOU SHOULD TAKE ALL OF THE FAMILY FRIENDLY CREW!!!!!!!!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏 also great video guys I LOVED it! (The end music was on point by the way)
Nah my names Lou 💀
56:28 @Caspersight
very coincidental that I got a John Wayne Gacy book from the bookstore today before I finish the video and saw that you were talking about John Wayne Gacy
micheal from the cresnt hotel
SAM AND COLBYYYYYYYYYY your videos are the best!
Don’t get me wrong it was a great video and episode. I love all your humor. You make me laugh all the time but it’s not as intense of an investigation anymore. When you take these new people that have never gone and done an investigation. I’m looking for more scary more Contant more realization instead it looks like you’re just training and if nothing happens nothing happens. It’s a little bit more superficial now but it still was a good video. I just wish we can get that old Colby and Sam back. It’s just not that scary anymore. I know you’re trying to give someone else the experience of ghost hunting but really I like the real stuff but I still love you guys. Have a happy new year.
Yay my favorite boys!! 🖤💙🖤💙🖤
What happens in the window at 16:00?
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT WHERE THEY ARE AT IS 4 HOURS AWAY FROM ME I COULDVE MEET THEM😪😪😪
NO WAY VALK AND FUSLIE 🔥💯
Idk if it’s my eyes but at 37:57 it looks like 2 pairs of eyes in the side doorway😭😭😭
you guys should take yourrage on an investigation 😂
Its great seeing people be influenced by sam and colby even if they dont go on investigations with them like i watch The Boys and they started doing paranormal investigation as well and learned the estes method from sam and colby. They made a recent video and what they did is they connected the spirit box during estes to the camera so we could hear and it made things so surreal it made me feel like i was there. So glad for these people making these videos.
Yo !!! Concussion homie !! I suffered from 4 !!! Lol 😂 50:29
Pls do a vid with Tubbo or Ranboo
What is that in the right door at 37:58 2 light like eyes
Rae is the cutest human
Mf who got bored at 3am like this comment 😂
you guys should ghost hunt with @The Boys
Sam and Colby are literally the only reason I planned a trip to the Stanley Hotel. So excited
Do the krew or funneh
That was an awesome video!! Can't wait to see what's coming in 2024 :D HAPPY NEW YEAR <3
my fav thing to come home and watch fr🥹
I need u guys to go back to the conjuring house 🥰
I love this group, the girls seem to get really good reponses from the spirits INVTE THEM BACK!!!
IM SO GLAD YOU GUYS POSTED IVE BEEN WAITINGGG ❤❤
EEEEEEE HI SAM AND COLBY I LOVE U GUYS (I HAVENT STARTED THE VID YET BUT IM EXITED)
"Did you guys hear the rem pod outside" *police sirens* 😂
I wanna see yall take the sturnuolo triplets
hey Sam and Colby y'all are my favorite youtubers for 2 years now and I would love to go somewhere with y'all because again y'all are my favorite youtubers and if I could go i would love to go to the cresent hotel and thw wincherster mysery house and like the stanley hotel but I would like to go to ant hotal or house but I love you guys so much byeeeee <3
Do one with Tana that would be great
i dont think you should use ai generated images for historical facts :/
You should do a month at the conjuring house
I got board in the first 15 minutes I like the older sam and Colby adventure's the new one's aren't that good.✌️☕🚬ps bring back kallmekris & spookyboo I like to see people take things seriously.
hello
you should def hit up benoftheweek
VALKYRAEEEEEE YES
I love you Sam and Colby!! I'm your biggest fannn
Under 1 day gang
hi
they should meet cody and satori. It'll blow their minds. Thoughts?
"Ghost facers"
I’m scared of this video I poop my pants
A Universal sponsorship?! That’s amazing guys!!! ❤❤❤❤
🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ me! I have the guts! I’m a paranormal investigator and I’ll go anywhere! I know no one knows me and I’m not a big creator, but I have slept in the Conjuring house, I’ve investigated St. Alban’s, I’ve been to Pennhurst a bunch of times, etc. I’m down for anything! ❤  https://youtu.be/wA78zUqTaRo?si=ixMskIHFokWE6iP1
i would love to see the vanoss crew do this and grizzy and pezzy. it would be funny and amazing.
No way all of you were in my state and I didn’t know 😭
Finally, Sam and Colby do a video on somewhere I’ve been. That whole town is so beautiful but definitely spooky.
YAYY
BRO THE RULES WERE TO NOT TURN AROUND WHY WOULD U LOOK OVE YOUR SHOULDER DUDE 41:51
Also that brand of matches sucks they never light for me sorry you were scared though
A video not on a Sunday best day ever!
MY 2 WORLDS COLLIDING WAAAA I LOVE IT
WHY ARE THEY BOTH SO ATTRACTIVE THO…………
I bought their merch from Zumiez the other day and I was 😁 happy
Would love to see just Sam and Colby do an investigation (without guests)….unless it’s Celina.
Don't take anyone on adventure next year. Yous do better work and are better focused when it's just the two of you, no disrespect to the guests as entertainers and personalities but they're just way too disruptive and rarely seem to take it as serious as you
37:58 Colby’s stiff ssa walk is taking me OUT 😭😂
you guys need Matt King and Zane to go investigating!!!!
Love your guys content!!! You guys are amazing and achieved so much!! If you ever come close or to Indiana I would love to investigate with you guys!
i live near sam and coby
You guys have to try and take Joe Rogan and his friend Jamie to an awesome ghost hunt make it epic guarantee a 1 million view episode 👍👍
You don't post enough videos. Miss you ❤ loads xx
At 37.58 there pair of eyes looking towards them
IM SORRY DID YOU SAY SPONSORED BY UNIVERSAL?!!
Though I gotta say, the green tipped striped matches from that brand do NOT light. I bought a 6 pack thinking I'd be set for life and I got maybe 10 to light from striking.
Bring Markiplier next, yeah?
Yes please you guy's video's are amazing and i would love to see more and cant wait to see what the future holds .
If your watching this in the dark 👇
HAPPY NEW YEAR SAM ABD COLBY
PLS DO ONE WITH TUBBO OR RANBOO PLS
This was amazing hope you guys have the best new years and do more ghosts investigating next year❤❤
theory did u notice the flashlights only answered to the girls at the start, the other floor usually only affects the girls, coincidence???
Glad your back, thx for keeping a consistent upload schedule
2 months wait , and they give us this sht 😭
I started crying when I realised they had uploaded. I hope they realise how much I love them and how much others do too. They truly r the best ❤
You guys should definitely do more stuff with kallmekris and Celinaspookyboo maybe even introducing them to another person aswell but you should also invite these girls again!!
Ok so challenge for sam and colby. What if. Yall investigated in every state. Its a stretch but i feel luke that would be a cool thing to do.
I like (kal me kris & spookyboo) better no offense to the other guests but there no Kris or spookyboo.
Happy new year 🎉 Sam and Colby

Illinois in general is such an underrated haunted state because of the amount of limestone! Rockford Illinois has so many haunted locations that myself and everyone I know have had experiences in!
You guys should team up with project fear
you guys should go to haunted hotel or haunted house with all 4 boys from family friendly and jd
Happy last day of 2023 everyone!! ( or tmmr for some ! 🎉 )
9:16  okay while watching this, I heard my dog walking down the hallway towards me, heard the jingle of her collar, so I turned to greet her but she wasn’t in the hallway. She was curled up on my bed sleeping. 🫣 but I distinctly heard the jingle of her collar as it sounded like she moved closer to me from the hallway.

Love you guys and your content!

I’ll love to join you guys
worlds collided with this. So cool having them on! I died laughing at Rae and Leslie scaring you guys oh how the turns table
sam and NEED to take the sturniolo triplets on one!! if you think so 👇🏻
I LIVE IN ILLINOIS
The fact that the boys are daring this guys to meet them is funny
I'm a creator and I would love to go out on a ghost hunt. I live in Sweden though (I am from the US). I became a review channel a few months ago, but I used to cover spooky stuff during the month of October. One place I would like to investigate is the House of Priests in Sweden. It is supposedly the most haunted place in Sweden. It's been investigated by Ghost Hunters International.
Ghost hunting has to be one of the coolest things to learn about and watch it happen. I've had personal experience with all sorts of things but you guys really have had some crazy things happen.
VALKYRAE AND FULSIE WITH SAM N COLBY? MY FAV STREAMERS AND GHOST HUNTERS 😍😍😍😍
Plz do the sturniolo triplets
I never thought I would see them play the hosting game again but here we are
You should try to get mmg
This is a group I never thought I’d see together but somehow is the very thing I needed
I just searched up sam and colby and saw this, I did not watch no tiktok 👍
I vote Twin Paranormal  😏
I think you both should do another video with faze rug cause you guys are the ultimate ghost hunting duo but also you should do a video wih the Omargoshtv I feel like a video like that would break YouTube
Every girl who joins Sam and Colby ends up feeling sick at the start of the investigation.
YOOO WHO ELSE REMEMBERS THE PARTY GAME IN COLBYS HOUSE!!!
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS AHHHHHH
I love all the Celina and Kris colabs!
Love this video today
37:08 my dumbass head will force me to look back💀
The 20th time they've gone to a "most haunted town in america" btw
why did he put the camera in his ballz
that was amazing
You two should totally come to New Orleans in Louisiana. It’s the most haunted city in the United States and has tons of history and haunted places!!!!!
That girl in the hat looks like my aunt
is no one talking about the eyes at 37:57
OML FOR CHRISTMAS I GOT YALLS MERCH (I hope yall see this)

For the billionth time the flashlights will go on and off like that no matter what. It’s science, not ghosts. It only feels “intelligent” and you all know that.
Take the sturniolos
bruh my friend used to live in alton illinois before he moved to texas. me and my brother would drive like 1 1/2 hours from st.louis to hangout with him
id be like WHATS THAT BEHIND U so they turn
Alton is only a few hours from me!! I was hella excited to see that they were in Illinois, there’s a few places near me that are supposedly haunted including a place my grandma used to work at and she has some stories about it!!
I remember Sam doing the hosting game a few years ago when him and Colby had lived in the trap house
@theboys
LETS GOOOOO
when i live in illinois and they said it 😭😭🤍
Okay but I really need Leslie and Rae to do another Sam and colby shoot or even any type of ghost hunting because they were like… surprisingly good!? And composed and insightful!? I love their streams and this was just next level of entertainment from them!
BRING THR STURNOLIO TRIPLETS
Can I come on an investigation with y’all ?
When y'all were walking into the pool after y'all started the hosting game you can see eyes in the doorway on the right
Comment below me if you love Sam and Colby (my fav YouTuber I have a hoodie of colby slay✨)
This is like old Sam and Colby when they would do the 3am challenges when they lived at the old house, and I’m here for it!
so i just watched the over night channel on their latest video and they had a Harry show up and it turned out to what they believed to be a dark energy or spirit... might not be related just thought it was weird.
AND JARED AND ZACH
AND ZANE AND HEATH
Today is the best birthday ever just because Sam and Colby posted
Sam and Colby is so cool
Can I please be in the next video I really love the paranormal and would love to experience some of the paranormal
I was not expecting to see Valkyrae and Fuslie .. a lot of fun to watch xD.
Who else thought she was Jenna Ortega 😭
Just saying but I dont mean to scare you guys but I kinda feel your guys is energy I cant describe the energy but I kinda feel numb so again not mean to scare you guys
I am an hour away from that place. I wish I went there to explore and meet them. SAM AND COLBY FOUR LIFE ♥️💖♥️💖
real ones know Sam did the hosting game years ago🤞🏾
An Australian comedian named Isaac Butterfield does a few ghost hunting videos with his wife in Australia, you guys should definitely hit them up to do a haunted video in Australia!!

Hi Sam and Colby. Can you please take @lyssynoel with you guys in 2024?
Ever since i was 2 i kept seeings like shadows and like transparent figures in my house when i lived there, if i'm being real the spirits were so nice and kind they kinda of like protected my family and so i'm currently 17 right now and ever since 2021 when i first watched you guys i always saw a entity in the background or walking around in that area ya'll were in so, thought ya'll should now that! But I love watching you guys!! Hope I can meet you guys one day!! 🥰💕
OMG I LOVE RAE AND LESLIE OMG

1:46 Why Colby shoved the camera towards his ball?

half of the video i’m looking at colby….
you guys should collab with THE Boys. that might be an interesting video.
Heyy guys, i know you are coming to Australia  and im in marybrough vic and ive seen many places around my area that are haunted or have had many things happen in them there is a whole street that happens to be haunted its called WHARF STREET if u guys have the time to look it up and maybe check it out while in Australia. id love to meet the both of you and maybe  investigate with you.
people who want to explore haunted places with sam and colby   👇🏽
in the pool, it looked like Colby turned around, not tryna get you in trouble Colby, just saying...
I literally used to live like a half hour away from here like 2 and half years ago. My mom and dad went on ghost tour there once. Funny thing that I realized once i asked my dad was that he captains a tugboat on the Mississippi River and goes by Alton all the time, which he was doing in late November, just like the equipment was talking about in the pool.
Ofc y'all were in Illinois when I was there ofc why do y'all always film vids when I'm in the state but I never see yall😤😤😤
Tag Mr Beast army here
you understand you can free those sad souls

i want to see u guys try to make a video with mr beast
41:52 think coby look behind him?
my vibrator is off??? The fuk does that mean 😂😂
Didn't know if anyone noticed but the left figure in the SLS looked like he was flicking and catching something, like how someone will flip and catch a folded pocket knife. It looked like a practiced deliberate motion.
You should ask ashton kelly he's a YouTube who's in LA and does skateboarding content I would love to see him on the with snappy
Y'all should have corpse husband as a guest
you guys should feture or colab with markaplier
👀
18:33 rae gave the camera the finger

And hope you tries india food the people in india really want to see you
😅❤
I LIVE IN ILLINOIS 😭😭😭 I’ve heard there is a haunted hotel in Chicago called the Congress hotel were a girl got raped to death in a room. There is also a devils chair in Danville Illinois located in a cemetery,you can sit in and make a deal with the devil for 7 years
sam and colby posting really cheered me up because i found out this morning my brother passed away he just had a kid not to long ago and we were gonna go see her.i miss him so much we were really close when  we were younger.
WOAH HOLY SHIT SAM AND COLBY ARE SO CLOSE TO ME
Colby looked behind him
I did some digging and that name is on the list of ppl who died
Staying up all night on new year watch Sam and colby
i live in iowa, for my 16th birthday my mom and i went here and it was an awesome experience. she went to the pool with our emf reader and all the pool ghosts were touching up on her lol. i went down there with it and no activity. the basement was also fun, had two rocks fly by my area. Such a great experience and awesome to see you guys go here!
Idk if it was sam moving but at 16:01 there was like a shadow on the middle window
I think yall should collab with AOK, he reacts to scary videos and would be a good person to take on a REAL ghost hunt.
We really want to see you coming in india plz hope you see my comment
Go to Australia
This is fantastic
Obviously I wasn't there but, "chair" and "prayer" kind of seemed to mean the person in the chair(Rae), who y'all were using as *bait* , needed to/was pray(ing) or be(ing) prayed for. And Rae literally proclaimed that she wasn't going to move from that chair so she unintentionally anchored herself as bait and somewhat turned herself into a lighting rod.
The boys YouTube channel The boys go to a haunted lighthouse
Babes wake up same and colby just uploaded a new video      (Here in 4 hours button)  👇
Loved seeing this group together for the end of the year video, it was so entertaining! Thank you for such great content this year guys! Can't wait to see what comes next!❤
Y’all need to get Eddie vr and lazarbeam to do this with y’all

How the fuck did you manage to get sponsored by universal studios AKA a fucking Movie studio
One of the only haunted places without a mirror!
Great video‼️. Ty for sharing♥️
Love from northeast india
More content with Ash and Alaina please 🖤
Sam and Colby said it's the first haunted pool they've seen, what about the queen mary pool it was haunted.😂😂
William afton

who wants to see the boys come on? (Mully, Narrator, Eddie, Josh +Juicy)
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE DAY THAT SAM AND COLBY EXPLORED SOMETHING IN MY STATEEEEE
Rea and Leslie:used to video game spirits  Sam and colby:used to real life spirits
My friends and I might go watch the movie night swim on Friday at palace pointe
Plz come to North East india
I think that if you guys wanted serious answers you should go and try to be exorcists. You'd be good at it and it's be a better way to channel your energy. 🙏💜 God bless boys.
Faze rug come on u know everything crazy with rug
@16:00 what was that in the window???
Just small little spiders
You guys should investigate the old Osawatomie state hospital! Or do a mini series just on haunted Kansas locations!!
I came to watch them ghost hunt not get a face full of Colby's crotch in the first 5 min🤣
The girls did great in that 7mins 😁👍. That Estes was so good 👏
I'm gonna be honest, the only reason why I'm watching this video are the story of course, but also Sam and Colby; I've watched\heard a bunch of game compilations featuring Valkyrae and both, her voice and whole attitude, I'm not a fan, she's way too loud and dramatic, I've never seen the other girl, so I have no comment about her for now
Sam and Colby if it’s true I am SO EXITED for you guys to come to Australia and PLEASE come to queensland! ❤️❤️ you guys are the best and I LOVED this video
i didnt get a fucking notif for this? 😭 (yes i saw insta but it only confused me more)
Was there a 5th person there? They only show 4 of them but when they put their phones on the chair they say 'all 5 of our phones are there' just wondering if there was a person off camera there or smthing
Just bought y’all’s merch today. Amazing way to end my year.
You guys should take Eddie and his friends
This is really entertaining 😊😊😊😊😊
Can somebody please get clix over here

Hey y’all think about this in the pearl story her abusive husband took her ring after she died I think he had a mistress on the side and he married her after pearl died.
Cassie sounds a lot like the little girl that drowned in the swimming pool of the Queen Mary.
@irelandboysproductions  COLLAB AGAIN
Can u do a collab with the boys yk like Eddie narrator josh etc I think it would be great 😅
Love that you guys ended your 2023 in Alton.  Grew up in the surrounding greater Alton area. Hope you guys were able to see some of the other famous haunted places.  If not, guess that’s an excuse to come back again. Thanks for what you guys do!  Keep up the awesomeness and keep kicking ass!!
I live not that far from Alton maybe a small short trip that is cool that you guys visited the haunted city in Illinois I been to the Alton city when ever the flood happened the first flood from quite some time
Sam and Colby you guys should do a Collab with the boys, especially Eddie, i think it would be a banger of a vid
YESSSS I LOVE VAL OKG YASSS
Please don't tell me that im tye only one who is watching this at 00:03 night😢😢😢😢
Less than 5 hours!!
I live near Alton and i didnt think it was haunted. All i know is that Alyon and Grafton are just filled with bars and bikers.
We need another video with Rae and Leslie in 2024!
On so from where I am in Trinidad people see a girl but in a white town on the highway Uriah Butler Highway and right as they see her they always get into an accident.
21:02 Im so embarrased🙁
I’m watching this at 1am, help 😭
I have been watching you for 6 years I am now 17 and I just wanna say how proud I am if you guys and of how you guys are doing so good and I don't care if this doesn't get any likes or replies I just hope your reading this Sam and Colby when you are going through hard times you will push through it in other vids and I just wanna say how happy I am I found this channel and I don't know how your getting hate but you have made me go through my depression no joke and I love you guys for helping me and i have so much respect for you guys or one of you editing videos all night❤ Love-layla in Australia  I was crying while writing this
Sponsored by Universal!? Damn! Yall coming up!! 🎉🎉
PLZ COLAB WITH THE STURNIOLO TRIPLES PLEASE THATS I ALL IM WAITING FOR!❤
WAKE UP SAM N COLBY POSTED A VIDEO
right at the Nic of time, was just saying how I wanted to see a new Sam n Colby video.
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE
Not sure if it is me or not but there are eyes at 37:57
37:57 in the right doorway you can see 2 lights, almost as if they are eyes watching them If you zoom in it also looks like there are another pair of eyes watching over the first.
I want to all the guests they had to go to one haunted place together
Who else agrees that Sam and Colby are brave enough to do this for us? ❤
I’m watching this at 11:00pm uk time and I heard a bang downstairs 😮 I’m scared
I love watching your shit in the night.
the AMP squad should be in the vid with you
We need part 2 of rae and Leslie 🤣 please 🙏
They take this scary bs experience and turn it into a comedy this is why I love their content
Check 22:18-25 there was something swoosh pass behind the bar table behind Lesley and valkyrae
I live an hour from here. Going ASAP
at 16:00 Did anyone notice the shadow go accross the window? Yes it could be Colby with the camra light, a car's headlights or a combination of both. But just in case, I wanted to point it out.
Ooh four hours away from Chicago !! Definitely gonna check it out !!!
Is it me or did I thought in the photo that they were laufey and her twin sister😭🙏
Damn they were just 3 hours away from me
Sorry to say but it looked a lot like Colby was ready for the crash at 8:50 he was looking like he was waiting for it
do a video with The Boys please !! :)
@markrober - you should check out the science of ghost hunting with @samandcolby
I think the Estes method should of gone longer , there story seems to be trapped in history now suffering, a story that should be uncovered , I think it was harder that time cuz on how much anger in between them it makes it hard for the Estes to come thur Clear
Yall been cooking up all these vids and have yet to make disappointed
@penguinz0 should do one with them
51:40 the way Colby says mickey 😭🤣 then   ‘Oh’
18:43 Rae just flipped us off
Yoooo my favourite streamers with my favourite YouTubers
37:57  there was something that looked like eyes in the side door
Here before1 hour
I just love Sam and Colby, I get so excited to watch their videos no matter who they have investigating with them.🖤❤️🤟
fun fact, john wayne gacy lived about 15 minutes from my house
William?  William Afton 🟪
Thank you guys for another video I hope you guys have a great new year and have lots of new scary experiences!!
When even the ghosts fangirl over Rae and Leslie 😂

“I saw a mouse 🐭.” * proceeds to add mickie mouse.* 😂😂
Pls bring the boys they have said in there new video where they go to the lighthouse they want to do a colab with you
Omg heyyyy❤❤❤❤
Does Zak Bagans  count for being on an adventure? To invite?
54:53 wait first time? what abt queen mary's pool
not much a scary movie person, i'm not a fan of the feeling they give me. But I would love to go and do some paranormal investigations. I have had 2 experiences with spirits. One i was touched and another was a poltergeist activity that had to have a little raggedy anne doll. I'll have to make a video on what had happened.
i love your vidoes BUT THE IMAGES NEED A WARNING...
me 22 mins in: "what is this, an hour long?" *checks and it is in fact an hour long* 😂
@jschlatt @tednivision do a vid with these boys
41:53 Anyone else notice Colby casually breaking the rule of the game by standing still and looking behind him?
JANUARY 5TH IS MY BIRTHDAY
Imagine smashin valkyrae in a haunted house 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
*Haunted hotels, my fave.* 😭
You should aph Aphmau a minecrafter join you both
Today is my birthday. I'm so happy they finally posted again
investigated there and watched a beach ball get kicked down the stairs with nobody standing near it...
Meh..
Love you Sam and Colby you guys are so inspiring and have changed my life. I love you for that thank you and keep up the good work you guys go through so much for us we owe it all to you guys ❤❤🖤🖤
Sam and Colby's logic is 7ft tall shadow men? Nah thats fine not that scary. But a spider? GET UP AND RUN
Okay so I really want to go on an investigation with these guys. I really want to try the Estess Method 😂😂
That face Colby makes always makes me smile😃 e.g 29:59            Who else agrees?
imagine being on shr**** and going to a haunted place bro id be tripping so hard no lie😂😂
1:03:57 when they were taliking about this before i thought colby would be perl
I've never seen valkyrae before .. but she is beautiful.. wow!!! Lol
i was so excited to watch this
😂😂I was just coming into YouTube to call them out for not having another video out 😂😂😂
I would love to see someone from Smosh or more Kris and Celina
guys i got scared when i looked in the mirror my mirror
This video has been posted on new years eve for me in Australia and something is telling me I'm not ready for 2024 after everything that has happened this year but you guys have truly helped me get through 2023 and I couldn't appreciate you guys more ❤️  Keep making great videos just like this one in 2024, and good luck for the coming year.
everyone is commenting about the video being great and funny and everything and this video was incredible literally loved it. But gonna say something I have been watching Sam and Colby's videos from the last 4 years and just about this video specifically didn't go right with me like while watching it I got really bad headache then I thought it might be just me watching my phone for a long time but then I switched videos I watched something else and surprisingly my headache was gone and even now as I am commenting I don't feel the headache anymore. Wait also well I think it's just the camera lighting but while they were at pool with the guide at the beginning I kept seeing a shadow peeking behind a pole behind the guide like across the pool and while they were leaving I kinda saw a face from the door of the pool room and also the wall if you see at 11:22 on the wall behind the guide the paint is like washed out and it looks like some man's face which is insane........................
After all the proof given against Cody and Satori and Sam and Colby’s support of them, I cannot help but have doubts about the owner and his white light experience.
*At **51:18**/**1:08:46** LOOK IN THE GLASS WINDOW BEHIND THE GIRLS! THERES A FACE*
BRO YOU ONLY POSTED THIS 4 hours ago and YOU LITRELLY ALREADY HAVE 400k VIEWS THATS HOW FAMOUS YOU GUYS ARE BTW LOVE YOUR VIDEOS AND I checked your channel 5 hours ago to see if you had a video 🤣🤣🤣
Sam and colby can you guys please maybe lower your merch prices because my mon don’t have the money for it and im a really big fan can you please respond to this it would mean everything especially since my grandma just passed 😢❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
PERIOD IM HERE FOR THISSS
No one with all the respect in the world it’s so much more genuine when it’s just you 2 just the way u started off.I wouldn’t mind some new abandoned areas either,anyone else agree.
22:14 IS a shadow figure tjat pass trought the bar behind the girls
Im such a big fan of you guys ive been watching you for a short time but in that short time ive watched almost everything im 15 years old and youve made me more aware of the paranormal and i thank you both for making my life better and aware and i will always continuously watch you both ❤❤❤
Fun fact all the cemeteries in Alton make a pentagram from sky view !
Okay hear me out Sam and Colby, so the hosting game is REALLY good. Like it's good I think that you guys should incorporate the game into your investigations because the more you do the more things are likey to Happ you can even have it as a challenge but I think you guys should do it often think it's a good way to investigate.
Its so amazing how snc and rae and leslie instantly got along and seem like theyve been friends since forever
Wait did they just say Universal Studios???🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just watched this and I am a true fan! This video Really spoke to me because when the 2 girls were in the slaughter room 3 names were mentioned On the Alice box. My mums-Carol (passed 27 years ago). My dad’s-Harold (passed around 7/8 years ago) and my nickname Tina (short for Christina). I know it is not in relation to me but it blew my mind. Felt like they were communicating with me through your video because they know I’m a fan!
I’ve been waiting for this video since Valkyrae said she would be in one of ur videos 😊
It’s actually savannah
Sorry gotta do this...those weren't spiders on the front door...they were daddy long legs😂😂😂😂😂
24:48 colby's reaction to strong alcohol 😂😂
Skinny valders Manchester
you guys should go to the Russell hotel in Sydney Australia next year and tell us when you are going
24:58 “aw shit” Colby thought he was going back lol
TAKE THE STURNIOLO TRIPLETS
WAKE UP SAM AND COLBY POSTED.
Hello pookies 🥰❤️
Please go somewhere in Japan I would love to see some Japanese ghost and hear there stories also I love your guy’s videos they make me feel like I’m actually there ❤️
why is the music at the end of the video actually a whole vibe what
RAHHHH I THOUGHT RAE SAID FUCK NAH LMAO!!!!!!!
hosting game reminds me of sam doing it in the trap houseeeee omg
Absolutely love Sam and colby would love to see them go back to goat man’s bridge with kmk again and also Celina as she missed the last time they went xx
Bring Eddie vr
OML 😂❤❤
Y'all need to take fans again. That would be amazing. Can't wait for your next vid! Also, thank you so much for the Conjuring House series, that helped me a lot.
37:58 THERES SOMTHUNG IN THE DOOR WAY
😂 lmao! A new drinking game!
Sam and Colby have seen a haunted pool before, at the queen Mary ship!
Guys no need to worry about the spirit shower on that house   Metatron just wanted to rule heaven and didn't get his way so he cast out the angels nothing to worry about. (For those who don't understand it's a reference to supernatural, a show)
gotta get the group on this bro
You guys should collab with Swoop!
Yall should take laurnZside and her husband on one of these
Y'all need to have a collaboration with Nick, Matt and Chris😭
I feel like Pearl was coming through Colby and George was coming through Rae and Pearl was saying she had no choice but to die. And I think she was saying George cursed us.
you guys should do an investigation with @omargoshtv , he’s an awesome ghost hunter and i think you guys could introduce him to new things!
COLBY LOOK BACK AT 41:45 YOUR GONNA MAKE ME DIEE 😭😭😍😭😍
This street in my hometown is haunted there’s a restaurant called the deane house on inglewood, Calgary ab Canada.  Also on that street there’s a pub called the hose and hound that is also haunted as well, also the suitor house on the same street as well, school that is called Alexandra. Airdrie house in heritage park, also in heritage park there’s a house called prince,  also in heritage park there’s a store called gledhills. So if you guys ever go to Calgary ab Canada go on there ghost tours to find out more about these places I’ve suggested. But here’s some more places to check out in my hometown. The rose and crown pub, lougheed house, doll block fairmount palliser hotel bow valley ranche. The zoo bridge.  Rouge restaurant, knox united church, cat n fiddle. Devils playground.
People do rent out hotel or motel rooms to take their own life. It's  a common place to go so that their family aren't the ones to find them. The chance of you staying in a room where someone has passed away is not as uncommon as you may think.
Pls bring out case oh and jynxi
I feel like they stay up watching there edits and ship videos i dont know why😂
Bro I thought they were dead😭😭
👍🤘🖤❤🖤❤Colby❤😝❤Sam🖤❤🖤❤
did they make the fnaf movie
At 37:57 I see eyes watching from the other door
Great episode and the ladies did a damn good job. Very impressive!! Side note, Rae and Leslie are mad cute
Strange there is a town named mineral wells in Texas and also is famous for hauntings as well as belief the water was special and had healing abilities.
hiii
I know yall see that shadow in the back  time 16:00 in the window
I MISSED YOU GUYS SM
Blud was shitting 😊♥
I loved the video, It was fascinating to hear when colby and rae where doing the estes method the fact they almost had a fulll on conversation. Keep doing what you do guys its fantastic and i love alll the vids <3
We need to see more of kris and Celina in these again x
W
Just stops the first shot to his 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love you guys videos they are really creepy tho but can you go explore more abandoned places
Tomas sanders!
Definitely need Punz and Cate in one episode ! Cate would be freaking out the entire time and Punz just chilling in the back xD And Sapnap and Dream in an episode ! Dream would be teasing the hell out of the spirits and Sapnap would be screaming and trying to debunked everything xD
try to collab with sturniolo triplets
Yo guys I have a question as a new creator into paranormal stuff like what you guys do what do you recommend cause i wanna do this kind of stuff.
We need more content with Larry!
I love the group foto at last its like as positiv like the whole rooms u investigated
We need a DREAM TEAM collab. So make it happen with George, Sapnap and mr I don't belive in ghosts Dream
It feels weird to say, but the more I watch your videos the more I get feelings that I’m not always alone.
My grand parents have a tea old house on their property and my family called it the slaughter house because when my dad and uncle found it, there was a soccer ball hanging in a bag and they thought it was a head
I was waiting for you to post, its incredible of you to  posted two whole videos after conjuring house , appreciate you taking so much risk to entertain us, but I insist you both to take care of yourselves too , be healthy physically and mentally.I would love to see bailey sarian hanging out with you  . She's really fun and have a great personality and might  be interested in an investigation. If that's a possibility for you guys ❤❤❤.
3 content creators I want to see in 2024 is Twin Paranormal
i love yalllllll
I love you guys❤✨💘
I just wanna say that you guys are amazing and have a happy2024 and remember the memories from 2023
If sam and colby colabed with jimi jackson I would cry. It's would be the best funniest vid ever
It’s says November 11th my birthday is November 12th . But the facts that it is now December 31st . It’s been a monthh

You should come to North Carolina and go to the biltmore estate or the grove park inn and there’s also a place called the devils tramping ground
i wish i cud come with you
I lived in Staunton ILLINOIS  and Alton was like 15 minutes away from me and I am sad I don't live there no more
I really think you should Make a video with the sturniolo triplets u and the triplets are my fav YouTubers and I could not live without y’all and I feel like u would get along
# Danny Duncan
4:15 Sam: yapping about the place Colby: casually staring into our soul
I watched the boys go to the haunted light house you guys went to a while back, they came up with the idea of putting a a mic in the headphones for the estes method so the audience can kinda listen along which seems like a great idea and I wanted to mention it
You should do a video with my fav small streamer Just_CallMeHay3 he really loves ghost hunting but all he has is a emf reader😂
Omg my two worlds colliding, been fans of y both for so long
sam and colby i would if yall would talk to abigail again cuz i miss her and i think she would be happy if yall visit her again
This one was awesome fellas!
Mineral wells basically has the same exact story just a little different
Rae and Leslie: AHHHHHH Sam and Colby: guys don’t forget to go get the merch its at zumies now no way
SSundee or me when School is over
I love it when the guides match the energy. This guide was lovely and I loved his story telling and his view on hauntings.
Where is Sykunno!?
You guys should take out the ha sisters somewhere.
Sam and Colby Ik you probably/definitely won’t see this but you guys have helped me so much cheered me up when I’m down made me believe in things I didn’t know were possible and I love you guys sm (I think I Alr said that idk tbh) but I want you to know when sometimes you don’t feel like filming or you are upset you don’t need to force uself to film this is coming from one of ur biggest fans so I think I cover what most of ur fans think but you don’t deserve any pain because you make me so happy and I always end up binge watching all ur old vids bc they always make me smile (apart from when one of you guys cry that honestly makes me cry more) ❤ you guys don’t realize how much support you gave me when I was sad and it was just by you guys living ur life’s to the fullest and doing what I hope makes you happy and ur so important to many people and I hope you realize that xxxxxxxx -ur fans 😂
Im only at 42:16 and i swear i saw colby turn around and look behind him
Well fuck I don’t live too far from Alton. How come I didn’t know what Sam and Colby were gonna be in my stomping grounds? Damn. 🤣
It's been a great ride since the beginning you guys are by far the best youtubers ever love to you both and happy new year to you guys your friend and fellow youtuber paul in p.a
Hello
Face the boys they want beef with u I think
My non Sam and Colby fan friend: “So what do u learn from them besides ghost hunting and being goofy”.  Me:”To be more scared of bugs then demons”.
My friend likes Sam & Colby and I like Valkyrae & Fuslie so I watched this with my friend :))
Day 6 of asking Sam and colby if yall can go to mineral wells haunted hill house its super scary and I think yall might not have a good time bit we definitely will watching yall deal with demonic demons
Twin Paranormal
I really liked Sam and Colby and thought they were genuine until that video from John Wolfe. Those clips are undeniable that this is a joke to them. It made me kinda sad.
MY NAME IS TINA OML 😭😭 IK IT'S PROB LIKE A SPIRITS NAME OR SOMETHING BUT STILL
We love to see Valkyrae & Fuslie getting out of their comfort zone and investigating in Haunted places. It’s definitely a real life horror game for them😂❤️
I just can’t watch them any more back then when they went on real adventures and the real adrenaline they had bruh I miss those days
Sam Colby please please please come to wales south wales Please please please
TAKE THE BOYS CHANELL WITH U SOME TIME LIKE MULLY AND JUICY AND JOSH AND NARRATOR AND EDDIE
37:57  right when she said she is afraid to walk look in the corner there is eyes in the dark
37:50 did anyone else see the pair of bright eyes in the doorway, not the one they went through but the one to the side..
I JUST Love you're content ❤
I live in Decatur my Zion area and every time we drive past I never believed that it was that haunted but I do now
It’s officially gonna be 8 years of being apart of all this. I remember the first video I ever watched it was when y’all stayed over night in that mattress store and from there I became in love with y’all’s videos I love y’all so much and happy new year hope y’all have an enjoyable day
Can we all just appreciate that getting sponsored by universal is absolutely insane 😅
I wanna see jacksepticeye in one of this investigations ❤
yall should bring maya winky to a hunted place
Right when I’m going to LV 😂
Omg I love you guys! Keep it up! I hope you hit 12 mil soon! ❤❤ I CANT wait till 2024! Happy new years! 😊❤
loving seeing the boys have fun again xxx
The SLS Camera freaks me out every time I see it!!! Ahhhhh!!!!  😂❤
I enjoy your videos and I love y’all’s work, I love how y’all just terrify guest, I love when y’all are with KallmeKris and Celinaspookyboo! great video, i think Sam turned around and that’s what messed it up but it’s probably because of practicing with the matches.
#TheBoys
DO A VIDEO WITH THE BOYS PLEAASEE!
finally
Having Leslie and Rae on this channel is surreal. They both seem like the type to get spooked from the smallest of things but are both extremely strong, and intelligent women. I love this collab, and I hope the girls wanna do more investigations.
@oompaville you and @kallmekris should do a ghost investigation with these guys
im so excited for the triplets video, especially since this one was sick.
Who else get excited when they see a new video
Rich people truly are soft as hell if they're afraid of their under ground pools😂
The girls were soooo adorable in the basement ❤❤❤
ALTON????? IM 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM THERE WTFFFFF
@samandcolby can you take the boys from @eddievr please also grate video
Bro this video just came out and it has 60k likes
Hi Sam and colby and my fellow viewers. If you see this, this is a cry for help 😅  So my little sis loves Dolls and she had a bunch. I went downstairs to get some ramen from the storage room and got jump scared by a doll in a pink dress and blonde hair in a bun….which would be a funny prank if it didn’t resemble my grandma. She always wore a pink dress with darker pink butterflies on it. I kid you not that is the exact same dress the doll had. I asked my sister about it and she said “I don’t have a doll that looks like that” I haven’t ruled out my dad or uncle trying to prank us but it genuinely just gives me the creeps. When I went back down to get chopsticks (we ran out upstairs) I got this feeling like my ribs were being squeezed. I got out of there as fast as I could but I have no idea what to do
The Boys!!
I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEOO
ILLINOIS? AND I DIDNT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE😀😀
colby reminded me of the bracken from lethal company
Hello

PLEASE GO BACK TO WITCHES FOREST!!!! when you guys first went there, so much happened while you were still a little unexperienced. IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT VID!!!!
I literally used to binge their videos after school everyday and  thought like maybe I've watched so many of their videos and now I have nothing to watch, so seeing them post more videos makes me happy especially before the new year!
I love you guys so much you bring a big part into my life
I shouldn't be watching this it's 1AM help me and I already saw something 😭
Bro you guys have to have Tana come with you somewhere.
Go somewhere hunted you guys and the boys ( the YouTuber group)

@The Boys
Broooo there clips of things scare me more than the video 🤣
still dont understand why they dont put both of the flashlights next to each other and have the spirits use them as yes or no instead of just one
y'all NEED to go ghost hunting with The Boys

#Clix #CoryxKenshin 56:24
Every YouTuber I watch now has that one comment in EVERY COMMENT SECTION that goes “if you didn’t come from TikTok then you can like this” like omggg shut up 🙄🙄🙄
Sure
Just gonna say, y’all have to have these two back. The spirits seemed to like communicating with them. 😊
got crazy life stores
Letssss go my favorite ghost hunters and YouTube streamers
37:57 there is something watching you threw the side door thing😱
how do i get in a sam and colby video
When he said tag your creator on YouTube it has to be IShowSpeed
anyone else recognize how 1:03:00 at during the estes meathod some said, “he stole it” like how when george asked too see pearls hand and said he needed her ring? maybe it was pearl saying he stole her ring ?? idk
sam and colby like it small
Colby colby colby you gotta spank the bottle before you drink it
HI SAM AND COLBYYY
You should get the Try Guys on a vid this new year!!😊
The Estes was crazy!!!  The arguing back and forth.
I’m so grateful u guys exist 😭 can u guys take ur friends Celina and Kris in another adventure ❤️ I’ve been following but I forgot when I subscribed I think it was 2022
I love how one of the stick figures in pearls room was crossing their legs like a young lady (posably pearl?)
you guys need to do james charles for colby
I did not expect this but I love it!!! GOOD JOB RAEEEE
The girls were so chaotic and it was so fun to watch , i hope they change their mind and go ghost hunting again with sam and colby ❤❤

I LOVE YOUR VIDEOSSS❤
It's so awesome that you guys went to Mineral Springs! I live about 10 minutes from there. Mineral Springs and the McPike Mansion are said to be the most haunted places in Alton. I would love to see you guys investigate the McPike Mansion.
Those poor lost souls
You guys are the reason I'm a 10/10 believer and I just hope that one day I can learn from you guys and become a ghost hunter myself. I love you Sam and Colby so much, thank you for completing my year with this amazing ghost hunting video. 2023 was me spending hours watching you guys on repeat and learning everything I can about the supernatural and honestly I love it. I'm not as scared about the afterlife as I was before I knew what I knew and I only have you guys to thank for making that happen. Thank you for an amazing 2023 and I cannot wait to spend the rest of my 2024 watching you guys experiment and explore the afterlife with new upcoming guests and new places to check out. I know this is long and cheesy but in all seriousness, you guys deserve it and  I seriously doubt you guys are even reading this but if you are, I love you both so much and hope that you guys don't stop what you're doing for a long time. You both are my idols and I look up to you both. Keep up the good work Sam and Colby and I hope that this passion of yours never goes away because it's become a big part of me and many of your fans and I'm seriously so interested in your guys content, I listen to every word and every sound that happens out of the blue. I'm fully committed to you guys and truth to be told, although I love many many youtubers, you guys are my fav. I could go hours and hours talking about yous but I'm going to end it here because no one is seriously going to read all that but I'd like to leave it here because I love re-watching your videos from many years ago and in a couple years time, I'm 100% coming back to this comment. Once again love you guys so so much, see you next year! <33
Why do I feel like they should collab with Sykunno and Toast as well 🫢🤨
Colby’s pose just made my day 😂
Sam and Colby go to the most haunted places in the world, not afraid. Then screams at bugs.
HE IS DOING THE HOSTING GAME AGAIN?!???!!
Thank you guys so much for teaching me about the afterlife it reminds me of my great aunt that’s why I see butterflies
#CoryxKenshin
I hope they come back to this place again I want to know more about its history
When Rae was walking into the room with the chairs, and Sam was behind her, I saw something in the camera when Sam was behind Rae… PLEASE PUT THIS ON SAM AND COLBY REACTS!!!  Edit: When it said “Braclet” in the ovilus, im making one rn!
Sam and Colby I’ve gotta tell u some weird strange things that happened in my house , I was up stairs trying to get unready and I was charging my phone and I heard my mom say my name I went half way in the hallway saying “mom did u say my name ?” She said she didn’t say my name , also I was going down the hallway I heard my name again everybody was sleeping I told my mom to come downstairs with me it has happened at nights sometimes morning , my moms story is that she heard my dad say her name but it wasn’t him nobody waas upstairs but her she said for my dad to stop joking around but it wasn’t him.
Collab with Sykuno and Corpse😮
It would be so awesome if @GlamAndGoreMakeup did a ghost hunt with you guys.

The old days when binaurals were a thing compared to the oversaturation of the search.....wondering about the quality of the audio file and secret socities.......I still have the original that helped me levitate a playing card, not even sure if it still exists on YouTube. Ethereal dreamcatcher doesnt anymore. (Becareful watching that one outside of new moons or banishings, fo' real tho)
Ranboo and  Tubbo

Anybody else see that weird shadow in the window at 16:00 could just be one of the boys but still creepy!
It's so refreshing just seeing how much they've grown, from thee vine era till now.❤
i feel like sometimes you should use ESTES method twice i mean you should use it by the pool it was the best choice people investegate it more than any other spot but you didnt do that much i feel like i am bit dissapointed

My name is William
Valkybae
I would love to see you do an abandoned with  @Riddem Ryder
The flash light only went on and off when the women asked the questions, I honestly feel like Sam just makes up the rules for things on the spot too try and make things more scary lol
I wish I could be on a ghost adventures with y'all it would be a dream come true 😁
I absolutely loved the conjuring house week videos. The end really got to me 😢😢.
these guys never fail to impress
Those girls, I actually cant stand them with their screaming and pitching , they are so annoying and especially the one with the hat..
I would to see u guys collaborate with the sturniolo triplets. I love ur videos btw keep it up!
1:03:52  when he says “no” I think that there was no option on staying with her husband.
I wish I could not be late to every video you post. I love you. Sam and colby
Yay it's always a good day when they upload
Yall should make a video with “The Boys” that would be awesome!!!!!
DUDE I LIVE IN ALTON, I WALK PAST THE HOTEL LITERALLY LIKE THREE TIMES A WEEK. I CANT BELIEVE I MISSED YOU GUYS.

This is gold!
The way Colby impacted your life and how you met him made me emotional and my friend i had met in Kinder garden ended completely toxic. You see she has a problem with alcohol and even on her Snapchat story she wanted me to bar hop with her, i said no in capitals, then went on talking abt exes. I feel uneasy around what she has been saying honestly, Sam I am in need of a friend like you and Colby being by each others sides and knowing that im an ambivert *like Colby* and i am kinda desperate for someone like you being there for Colby and Colby being there for you. I really need that. (I never talked to anyone abt my past friendship ever like this).
@CaseOH collab with these fellas
I love your videos, you should come to England again and happy early birthday colby 🎂🎊🎈🎉🥳🎁🍰⭐️
You guys need take the boys
Phasmophobia reminds me of you
I dare you guys to get perms to kick off 2024 🎉😜
Phasmaphobia tho 👻
A collab I never thought I'd see or need!
Guide: I’m not a big orb guy   5 seconds later   Guide; so I saw this orb
VALKYRAEEEEE
What was that in the video after he said 3 days?
Oh boy, i am just imagining how many purification rituals Rae's mom will have her do just to make sure nothing haunted follows her from this 🫣😜✌️
these might be the most respectful people youve taken on an investigation, love em sm
What was glowing at 37:58 in the door way to the right ?
You guys should take Bailey Sarian out with you guys on an adventure! That would be great!!
There is a haunted mansion in my town. The Whitmore mansion in Nephi Utah. You two should come down and take a look at it.
Amazing video! Thank you guys, we truly appreciate it, especially at this time of year! 🥳
them saying 'this will make you scared of YOUR pool' as if their viewers are rich......
15:59 there is a ghosts hand on the tarp on the right
i got so happy when i saw this 😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤
I’ve missed you guys ❤
So when are Sam and Colby playing  Phasmophobia with Rae and Leslie?!?!
this whole episode was just silly lol
This is giving me the Rave vibes in Milwaukee. Every time I go there I feel uneasy.
this is the last video of the year 2023 ❤❤
I got super sick watching this video, like almost threw up
Colby looked behind him During the hosting game.
Take Tana mongeau @tanamongeau
YOU NEED TO TAKE THE BOYS .JOSH.MULLY.EDDIE.NARRATOR.JUICY
I so wish I could go on a ghost hunt with Sam and Colby.
You guys should make a special video with Kris, Celina, and Caleb! That would be the COOLEST video EVER posted in the history of the universe.
Would you guys be open to do a collab with Twin Paranormal? I would love to see that!
The movie M3gan is a really good movie not that all the other movies are good but I really love the M3gan movie everybody has to watch it but if some of y'all are scared of a talking robotic doll no worries a 7 year old girl is actually playing as M3gan don't want to spoil it for people who haven't seen the yet
Y’all should go to the Congress Hotel
@samandcolby please do one with twin paranormal please. Love this video
You definitely need to bring Jacksepticeye and Markilplier on a hunt
U GUYS FINALLY BACKKKK 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
wtf was that shadow in the window?? 16:02
did anybody else see the shadow figure like fly by at 16:01 in the video
collab with Grizzy and Pezzy that would be fun to see
You guys know how you took Wilbur, George, Tommy, and Jack on these investigations? Why don’t you take Ranboo on this adventure! I think it would be great 👍
I'd love you guys to take Anthony Padilla with you, he would be great. He can be super goofy but also massively empathetic. I imagine he'd have great responses
WILLAIM AFTON! context- the ghost william
I can't believe they are in Illinois omg 😆😆😆😆😆
these girls are so anoyyying
IM GOING TO ZOOMIES THIS WEEK.
The fact that they were 20 min away from where I lived and I DIDN’T KNOW😪
We need the sturniolo triplets next year 😭
Yesss a new video❤❤❤
Hiiiii❤
it would be awesome if you guys did a collab with cdawgva and abroad in japan. .
Ya know, it would interesting if you and omar gosh did something together?
You know it is a good day when Sam and Colby post
don't thank us guys thank yall for putting out some amazing content.
Can u guys pls collaborate with the Sturniolo Triplets? It would be the best video ever!
Omg sssniperwolf would be perfect!
Ummm, the sls is just mapping the chairs. The reason why it's the 2 is because they are the same type of chair, the other one is different so it's not picking it up. Smh... Really really liked u guys for a min, but I'm very disappointed anymore. Especially after seeing the video of behind the scenes at the Blair house I think. The shit you guys say and do "off camera"  showed ur true colors. ...  I guess that's wat happens wen ur shooting for a younger demographic, they r so vulnerable and easily swayed. Hope y'all get back to who u r and take shit a lil more seriously. I'll ck back in a few months. I wish u all the luck n much light
omgg YESS THIS COLLABBBB
I thought they explored the haunted pool at the queen Mary ship or am I losing it
We need more abandoned videos next year🙏🏼
This place sounds like a place that ghost hunters investigated
Omg I am so happy they posted this really made my night
one of the girls name rae  my name rae and thank you for give me happiness
It’s 3 am and I’m watching this
PEARL WHY ARE YOU SUCH A GIRL
At this point, every haunted shit is the most haunted  😭😭
Carol's cousin only kept Harry
The spider is a ghost :O
Ngl you guys should collab with kai and fannum that would be such a good video
please upload more
It's a tradition for me to watch these at MIDNIGHT lol
Bro i always get so many chills watching sam and colbys videos
Bro y’all should try to get ishowspeed in this because I ain’t to see his reaction and I love your videos I’ve been watching since 2015 and I’ve been a fan AND I OOVE YOU BE MY HUSBANDS!!!❤
U GUYS HAVE TO DO A COLAB WITH THE BOYS
Heyyyyy sammmm and colbyyy y’all should go ghost hunting with nessa Barret I see you guys follow each other and she watches your videos as well and likes you guys so maybe go ghost hunting with her I think she would be down
I love this part 48:59! I die of laughing 😂😂
Y’all should take Kris and Celina to the Biltmore house estate in NC🖤  Or bring Kelsi Davies somewhere with y’all   Love y’all ❤
Sometimes when I watch paranormal videos i can feel the vibes of a room it’s super weird to experience
OMG I LOVE IT(I haven't even played the video yet)
Colby don’t look over your shoulder also Colby looks over his shoulder
funny that you say at 23;00 that normal holiday inns dont have people dying all the time cause i stayed at a holiday inn last week and the guy in the room across the hall from me died
You guys should go to Fort Laramie in Wyoming. It’s the most haunted place in the state, and since you guys haven’t explored it yet, I think it would make a really great video. Quick story; me and my family went there last summer on a tour and I low key got my hat hit off by something and my brother saw a lantern on in one of the hallways. We went down to check it out and there was nothing there. We were told it was the lady in green. You guys NEED to debunk this for us. Please if you can check out the Fort and see if the lady in green actually is still there. It would mean the world to me and my brother. Love your channel so much and I’m looking forward to your next video! ❤️👻💀
Something i know. Dont be scared of people spirits be scared of the evil people that are alive👍
Do one with the boys
Leslie and Sam freaking out and literally holding onto each other during the Estes Method has me dying..
EARLYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BTW GUYS YOU ARE AMAZING KEEP IT UP!
Hello guys! Anytime you’re down to come to Omaha for an investigation, we’d love to have you!
wait , didn't pearls husband take her ring? could that be the thing that was stolen?. also couldn't they be cursed to be together because of him trying to brake the marrige bond? excuse my grammar but- thats what i picked up-))
What the girls don't get is that being so scared and saying that you're "so scared" out loud makes these beings attracted to you! Like moths to a flame, baby. So, they came closer and closer because you kept saying how scared you were! Never admit that. 😅
I live in Alton I recommend to investigate the mcPike mansion
OMG OMG A NEW VIDEO
I live in granite city so this is very close to me
At the time 37:58 it looks like a pair of eyes right by the exit beside them….

If Sam and Colby tell me to go watch night swim,I will go watch night swim
If Sam and colby have taught me one thing it’s be afraid of bugs.not ghosts 😂😂
I have never been happier about a new video in my life…
Happy new years Sam and Colby I hope next year is better for both of you, love you❤
I get this video was supposed to be more funny like. But it’s kinda annoying getting random guests that don’t even do any paranormal vids or like anything serious in their vids. The whole vid was barely any investigation like seriously. It was just meh in my opinion. But good job on da editing. I know someone’s gonna hate on this comment but it is my opinion.
AT 3:17 THEY SHINED A FLASHLIGHT AND IT LOOKED LIKE A GUY IN A BLUE SHIRT AND KHAKIS
Another banger video!!!! I was wondering if you guys could ever do a collab with Twin Paranormal, they also do ghost huntings, and I would love to see you guys do an investigation with them, since they get a lot of activity :3
Sam Colby I know it’s probably in the works but we need to see Sam &Colby with the boys
By far my favorite guests! Love Rae and Fuslie
Rae was driving me nuts this episode lmao I feel bad she was so scared but some parts were hard to watch like lmao what did you expect 😂😂
You should take Coryxkeshin with yall that be crazy 😱
still can't believe my gowrls joined yall i laughed way too hard xD thank you for this <3
I personally don’t want to hate but I like it better when there isn’t a ton of freaking out.
hi omg i love you guys
Y’all should have Brittany broski on, her moms a ghost hunter!!
i would love to have the chance to go one one of these but the creator i would choose is @JoeBartolozzi
The sturniolo triplets should be in a video
You probably cant see this but a good place that you should visit is The Wabasha Street caves in Minnesota
Finally the boys have hit a spot close to home! I hope Alton treated you guys nicely and that you didn't have a run in with any wild Piasa birds out there! I also hope you guys got to check out the limestone caves while you were there! Can't wait to see what y'all have in store for 2024👍
From chicago IL
I have been waiting for a new sam and dolby video for many weeks
It's simple. If Rae or Leslie is in a video, I watch it
I live 20 mins from there why couldn’t you have invited me 😩
YOU SHOULD TAKE BWU (boywithuke) WITH YOU
Waking up to see the Sam and Colby post just makes my day❤
@Blesiv @KAED__ @theresfooos
pls go to Christopher Illinois!!!!!!
Bring Kris and cilena or georgenotfound with wilbret back please and can you make it more scary ❤❤
Like if you’re from IL!
It's so crazy too see how far you guys have come from all the way from vine to here, I have been watching ever since and also ever since the first haunted experience that video was 8 years ago, At first like 8 years ago I was a huge skeptic but as years went by and more videos like this started coming out I became a believer 10/10 , Like there is so much stuff out there that most people don''t know about, Ghosts won't fuck with you unless you let them. Ty sam and colby for those awesome years and may 2024 hold great and awesome adventures for you guys! <3 Love Angelina
Imagine being the ghosts when the girls were alone, your having a good Time then 2 weirdos with 78 demons attached to them come and take them lol
This was amazing and the ending was great. Im curious what will happen in 2024. Im curious if yall you can talk to angels!
@theboys
Why do I feel like I heard the name lady in blue but I have never heard of it before….
World’s most haunted cave ?
Your the bait lol
Ha! I will not be scared of pools because I can't swim in pools because I'm allergic to Chlorine 😢
You guys should collab with The Boys.
the fact that i was playing phasmophobia when this came out lmao
When’s the Sam and Colby and The Boys collab gonna happen 😭🙏🙏
41:46, lol colby  he looked back over this shoulder
You guys should invite Smajor and Shubble to came with you guys that would be awesome to see love you guys you always make my day better <3
This is 2 hours ago wow I thought it was a mouth or a year ago 😂
My house is Kinda 29:18  haunted
HELLOOOO 🫶🫶🫶🫶
I’m down to try with you guys Sam and Colby @Datboi_Ray2007
All say "Danke schön" to Niki who talked Rae into doing this 51:57 Byakugan Princess / hime ?
WHEN IS THE COLLAB WITH THE STURNIOLO TRIPLETS?
Wauuuuwwww. Loved it!  The rituals are sooooo awesome 😍 It made me happy to see that you used the binaural sounds. Been experimenting with it myself since I saw your Conjuring series. Can't wait for next year. I really hope you filmed at Aokigahara. Since Colby went there the first time, I've been drawn to that forest like it's calling to me. Wishing you guys a happy NewYear and everything you've been asking for. LY 🖤❤🕯
Video with The Boys. March 2024. It has to happen.
The boy
Dr.Mike, Josh and Seth, Nate, Faze, Celina and Kris together and then just Kris
The phobia in geometry dash
𝕃𝕠𝕧𝕖 the new video. More funny than scary!! 👻👻💀👻👻
Who likes is a OG OF SAM AND COLBY ❤👇
Once when I was 11 I was going on a walk and I saw like a blacked out little girl in a dress skipping then disappear then a couple of days later I heard a little girl say hi in my house restroom and then Laugh and for months after that I would fell like a little girl around me and sometimes I would feel like a small hand grabbed onto my finger and she felt safe so I named her missy
We jus gonna ignore how when they were talking to Cassie Colby turned around?
I’m waiting for them to do a collab with Brittany broski that would actually be crazy
Sam and Colby can u Collab with Sssniperwolf
This is so cool! I wish I could do one of these ❤
Omg Rae is SOOOOO adorable at 20:02 "i dont wanna be like you guys!!" 😂🤣❤
13:55 😂😂
would love to see pokimane, or markiplier, jacksepticeye
Me trying to get Sam and colbys attention to check their email part 45 lmao please please check it for a haunted location!!!
Please do a video with the sturniolo triplets it will be my favorite YouTubers in one video
I like my own like
Your videos are becoming trash. Inviting some boring people
@theboys
this just made me think of how sam used to want to be named leslie
Can you go to faze rugs old house that is haunted and after that can you guys go back to the witches
Get Special edd in a vide   👇
We need blesiv and Eddie and Karen and this fools  for 2024 it would be a banger they are hella funny would love to see them 🤍😂
I CAME HERE TO WATCH SOME OF THE OLD VIDEOS BUT FOUND A NEW VIDEOLET'S GOO
Finally!! Been waiting for this!!!!
You should come to Australia and explore in 2024. I love your videos and it would be cool for you to explore international places. Love you so much. Also I love your videos with kallmekris and celinaspookyboo. Love you so much❤️❤️❤️
awsome video guys i loved it! love ya 🖤
who else has been sponsored by Universal before?
Don’t know why I’m so distracted Sam and Colby were wrong about John Wayne Gacy lol
Love seeing guests that are actually respectful during investigation!!
I hope you can get @theboys on
@SamandColby I would LOVE to see you guys do a collab with Ryan, River & Wyatt of  @TwinParanormal that would be SOOOO freaking sick! Also, Daz Black is always a great time... He's a total nut! 😂 And (dare I say it?!..) I'd absolutely LOVE to see more of Satori & Cody with you guys!!! I'll NEVER forget the impact of those videos as long as I live! And I wouldn't worry about any of the negativity and negative ppl that was talking mad massive shit. Those people were only reacting out of shock and fear of the unknown and the disbelief in what they were witnessing with their own eyes and ears! They'll come around. So much love and respect for you guys!
You guys got a universal sponsor! I am so beyond are so proud of you two ❤ #winning
IT WOULD BE SO AWESOME TO BE IN A VIDEO WITH BOTH OF YOU I love spooky stuff but I think I'm a little of a bit of a minor because I'm 9 years old but I do listen very carefully so please
W Sam and Colby he did this for us 😊
I've been waiting for this
You guys should try to do one video with Paranormal files, their videos are really good
People who want a mouth at counjuring hause are allowed to like this comment :)))
somethin was moving in the window at 16:00 0_0
There's like a 2% chance Sam and Colby will see this but it's never impossible😢❤❤❤
The equipment said Michael while y'all used the binaural beats. Michael is well known to be an angel in the Bible.
OMG SO COOL
50:17  bro, the little ":(" CAUGHT ME SO OFF GUARD-- I STARTED WHEEZING. WBHABSHHAHAHAH--
You guys have to go to the conjuring house again with the boys they want to go ghost exploring with you guys
I think Brittany Broski would be an amazing match with Sam and Colby
Yayyy I’m here for the friend groups of Twitch and YouTube crossing over. It’s like the influencer Avengers lol you even have a Valkyrae haha.
Hey I used to live pretty close to there
Damn what a flex with that sponsor ! That shits major !!!
Why is your Merch always sold out??!!??!! 🤨🙄❤️‍🔥
Go to the fazerug tunnel again with him.
37:57 hold up yall see the fucking dots in the door?
Do a collab with jenna ortega
I loved it it was so good I am so ready for that new movie it looks like it will be an amazing movie great video Sam and Colby
I stayed up all night watching yall and when the vid came out i was so happy this video was sickkk love yall ❤
Can we get a collab with you guys and Jasko??? You haven't done one with him yet and I think the 3 of y'all ghost haunting together would be fucking dope as fuck bruh 🙏🏽🙏🏽
Much much love from Belgium. My grandma and grandma died when i was young. And im Happy that i can still talk to my grandpa even though he's dead but im doing it for years just with simple lights.I haven't heard of my grandma. She died when i was 5 I miss them... Lots of people i know have passed away this year. Its getting hard for me. But  this content really makes me happy! 😊 LOVE FROM BELGIUM 🇧🇪
I alway wanted to do a investigation with y'all, it look so fun!
shayne topp from the smoshcast would be so good in a ghost hunt
1:03:20 I feel like one of them is lying that's why that one sentence "the truth will come out " or something. Like the couple is hiding something idk
Aaa
I always have that issue with matches 😭
The best feeling is waking up to Sam and Colby posting! I love your videos and the effort you put in, it doesn’t go unnoticed❤🎉
Finally it's out🙌🏼
The Chanel Evan and Kaitlyn are really cool and I think that they would like to go ghost hunting! It would be so cool! They have gone once and they liked it so maybe they want to go again!😊😁
Why she say her vibrator turned off
I think you should bring next year maybe…Preston Or Dantdm
He never killed someone as a clown. But I love you Guys
As someone who lives in a town right outside of Alton- it’s true that Alton is well known for its haunting for sure! Everyone knows not to live in any area in Alton if they are superstitious especially old Alton areas 👌 crazy you guys were so close!
Hey!  If you're ever in the St Louis area again, check out the Lemp Mansion.  It's a legend.
My day just got 100x better when I saw that these guys posted ❤
BRO I WAS TALKING TO MY DAD ABOUT YOU! JUST NOW AND I SAW THIS VIDEO. (He doesn't believe u got cancer from the doll)
i literally went to high school really close to where y'all were at, shame you didn't have time to visit the haunted caves/frozen waterfall, there's some pretty cool abandoned houses back there as well. TONS more haunted places all over the city. Quite a few houses a part of the underground railroad in that neighborhood as well, which I'm sure impacted some of the supernatural happenings going on.
Colby: This is gonna make you scared of your swimming pool! Me, who already used to be scared when I was younger and I thought sharks were in the deep end of the pool: i think i'll be alright
When you guys said the pool was haunted by someone named William and I thought of William Afton:)
Yall when they did the host game I felt something on my back too
always excited to watch you guys!❣🤟
Sam and Colby happy new year to you and your family
Hi Sam and colby I am a girl and this is not my phone but can you explain why colby plays so many mean pranks hello me my hart heart hurts because of them.
Finally they came out with a new video. They make the best ghost videos
You should do a video with The Boys. they have been talking about you guys they went to the conjuring house
16:01 okay... wtf was that in the window?
‘He stole it’ HE STOLE HER RING AFTER SHE DIED!! watched it 3 times for that to match up in my head!😂 holy cow
Take the boys out they reacted to ur conjuring video
41:51 colby look with his neck behind him for something but like you said they cant look behind them with the neck😬😬😬
Ya you guys did the hosting game wrong . These r the instructions. 1. Begin at night. Keep your timekeeping apparatus and the matches on your person at all times. 2. Turn of all possible sources of noise in your dwelling. This includes telephones, televisions, computers, alarms, etc.. Be thorough. If your hosting room requires it, then draw the curtains or block the windows so that no light could be viewed from within the room. 3. Enter your hosting space and turn on the light. If the room includes no lamps or overhead lighting, use a flashlight, lantern, lit candle, or other portable light source. Candles, although correct concerning atmosphere, may pose a fire hazard, so proceed with caution. 4. Place your writing implement and piece of paper on your hosting room. 5. Leaving the light source, depart your hosting space. Proceed to the furthest point in your house from the area and call, “I’ll be ready soon!” Move from room to room of your house, repeating this phrase in each room, moving closer to your hosting space with every call. 6. When you arrive back in your hosting room, use the writing implement to write the next message on the piece of paper: “You’re invited! A gathering, hosted by [Your Name]. Takes place from [the present time] to [an hour from the current time]. Bring friends and family!” 7. Put the piece of paper in the center of the hosting room. 8. Stand in the door of the hosting room facing into the room and telephone, “I’m ready! Come in!” The Gathering: 1. Switch off the light and turn around. The open door to the hosting space should be at your back: you ought to be facing the shadow of your dwelling. Take out your three matches. 2. After a few moments of silence, begin counting out loud, starting at one and ending at 10. Do not look back. 3. When you get to the count of 10, strike the first match.If the first game lights on the first attack: Hold it as it burns and greet your guests by saying, “I’m so glad to see you! Thank you for coming!” Hold the match until it burns down as low as you can bear. If the match doesn’t light on the first strike: Drop it and immediately proceed to the next step. 4. Do not look back. Strike the second match. If the next game lights on the first strike:Hold it as it burns and greet more of your guests by saying, “I am so glad to see you! Thank you for coming!” Hold the game until it burns down as low as you can bear.If the second match does not light on the first strike:Drop it and immediately proceed to the next step. Do not look back. Strike the third match. 5. Do not look back. Strike the third match. If the third game lights on the first strike: Say, “Now everyone is here!” and count from one to 10 once more. If you have done this correctly, you’ll be able to hear and/or feel whispering, rustling, or a silent “thank you” behind you. Do not look back. When your timekeeping device indicates the gathering’s finishing time, say out loud, “Thank you for coming. Goodbye.” Walk to the nearest light source and turn it on. The gathering is finished and your guests have gone. If the third match doesn’t light on the first strike: You’ve got uninvited guests. Do NOT look back. Do NOT turn around. Do NOT pause to close the door. Run as quickly as you can to the nearest light source and turn it on. Lmfao
Sam and Colby should do a collab with the Sturnlio triplets, or Sapnap
I love how the second anyone in this video is scared, they immediately run to colby😭

Happy New Years Eve Sam and Colby! Rae was so adorable, I loved the enery the girls brought to the episode! Glad the 7ft Sasquatch that "throws rocks" didn't make an appearance, not sure the girls would've liked that too m, L😂L!!!👍👍🤪
Leslie was hilarious, checking her own pulse had me in tears of laughter, if your ever back in the UK, their are two places near me in Cornwall, the Jamaica inn and bodmin jail
live there in that stat
Sam and Colby you better be safe because none of us I want you guys dying so just be careful when you're doing these haunted places

This was SUCH a fun video to end the year with!! Idk if it would ever be possible, but I'd love to see the girls come back with the ENTIRE SALAD GANG! Corpse Husband included if he's able. And of course his identity would be protected somehow, they could find a way. Bring him along virtually if that's better for him. Imagine Corpse, Tina, Emma, Karl, 5 Up, Sykunno, Brooke, Rae, and Leslie all ghost hunting irl lol!!!!!!!! Omggggggg <3 That's who I'd love to see ghost hunt with Sam and Colby next. The salad gang <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 The girls killed it for their first irl ghost hunt!  HAPPY NEW YEAR, EVERYONE! <3

You should record the reactions to them hearing the the estist method and they conversation when that happens cause they might remeber things they thought they heard but didn't say
I live 10 minutes away from there actually I always see that building when I go that way also wanted to go in and see what’s in there but I’m kinda scared. Love your  content❤
Sam &colby why not try going to cj faisons farm at the pokamon forrest in delaware its supposedly scarer than the sallie house, its on a layline crossing and has a portal in the basement plus they have annabelle doll there too. Might be a interesting time for you
Can you try getting Specialedd Ford a adventure hes my favourite youtuber

MY TWO WORLDS COLLIDE
I thought this was coming out tomorrow
Did y’all use AI for the images throughout the video cause wtfff😭😭 😂
37:57 did anyone see two faces and four eyes staring at the group or is it me cause I notice it and zoomed in on it or am I going insane
SYKKUNO WHEN
41:51 pretty sure that counts as looking behind you Colby...
You guys need to do more with laary!!
I made it in 2 hours
Sam and Colby teach me more about history than school does💀                               And they make it interesting
YOU NEED TO DO ANOUTHER GHOST HUNT WITH TOMMYINNIT
This was so good! Can't wait for the sturniolo triplets collab
Y'all should come to TN
I don't know if that's just the light reflecting otherwise you can see a pair of eyes 37:56 in the doorway
Is it just me or did Colby turn around at 41:46
For some reason I would be so interested in a video with Rhett and Link  ghost hunting with them 😂😂
Gonna see it for my BIRTHDAY 🎂
yall saying first time at a haunted pool, but you forgot about the one on the queen mary ;)
I was SOOO damn excited to see you guys posted a video! Probably more so than I thought I would be. LoL! It's hard to follow the Conjuring series... But you guys killed it! Because you're MF professionals! 💯👏❤️ Anyway... So grateful for you guys and everything you do to bring us top tier quality content.. EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! 🙏🏼❤️👏💯🕊️
Maybe it's possible to record the audio of the estes method with a microphone in the headphone? 1:06:18
I have been waiting for so long im giddy watching this intro
i like the vibes i get from these videos
You should go to Alcatraz island in San Francisco!!!! Btw love everything!!!
Sam & Colby really need to bring The Sturniolo Triplets for a video, because I love all 5 of them and I think the triplets would have a spooky time w/ Sam & Colby 👻💚
My sister, my nephews, niece, mom grandma and grandpa all live close to there they all live in woodriver but we would always go to Alton the the “bat cave” you could actually go into it at one point but they closed it bc their were some people who went in and never came out. But this is so amazing to see you guy’s investing somewhere close to where I live to I have been following for about two years now and I just sent this video to those members of my family to watch.
So proud of Leslie and Rae for actually doing this! I never would have thought they would willingly do this, especially Rae
You guys should have the sturniolo triplets
the moment they mentioned the hosting game it gave me Trap House 1 VIBES
26:29 did rea say my vibrator is off? 😮
You guys are so amazing and you have made my year of 2023 so much better
I have to look into this limestone theory because I live on an old limestone quarry now filled with natural spring water and I have had a lot of paranormal activity.
I LOVE SAM AND COLBY WANNA KNOW WHY? U WANNA KNOW WHY? OK THEY MADE ME BELIEVE IN GHOST AND THEY HELPED ME NOT BE AFRAID OF THEIR CONJURING HOUSE I LOVE SAM AND COLBY🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
So excited to see Rae and Leslie in your video. I loved their bit in the slaughterhouse. You can really tell they're so sweet despite their shenanigans.
When the girls was alone and they hurd something it said rae said "I hurd something" that was not her voice it was oddly the rem pod saying it that's what it sounded like
Happy new years Sam and Colby and everyone that read my comment and everyone that is subscribed to Sam and Colby 🎉❤😂😊
MARKIPLIER (King of Horror games)
I can’t believe Colby and Sam were in Illinois 😢 I lived 20 minutes away from where they filmed 😭😭😭😭
Sam and Colby I live in illinois and I know a abandoned house near mine and I need to contact you guys
That spider at the start is called a daddy long legs no joke or I have been lied to my hole life😅
Sponsored by Universal is absolutely amazing, keep it up!🩵💙
Honestly it would be so cool to go to these places with Sam and Colby-
I love when they mess with their guests and make them do creepy quests. I wouldn't like it but its fun to watch and they keep things light hearted in a slightly sinister way😅
Another bangerrr fellas👏🏻  Love mineral springs too, such a unique location & Dave/Donna are such great people
They brought Valkyrae for their safety!
I love horror movies. i can't wait for "Night Swim" to release. I didn't realize that it's going to come out so soon until i watched this 😅
Yous should invite jynxi the r6 streamer
when y'all first went into pearls room I was like "woah..wait..my middle name is pearl" LOL I know it's also an old name so whatever but I thought that was cool yknow? but honestly I feel so bad for her like her story or whatever is so sad  EDIT: I put this here when I was watching this video like after y'all left pearls room and stuff and I'm still watching the video and I wanna say please be careful when and if you ever want to channel something because trickster spirits may act like the thing or person you are trying to channel and it can be very bad so I beg you both and all to be careful
I have just found out that I am a medium because I talked to my dead grandfather in my room. It was very weird but soothing in a way because at least I know that he is still with me and cares for me and my family
Stop bc there sooo beautiful. so glad for a new vid I’ve been reaching vids of yalls for ever love yall! ❤
I want to see a collab bettwin you guys and twins paranormal
it sounded like Pearl may have taken her own life (or died from injuries) because of a will or maybe George changed her will (Pearl may have even secretly changed hers and George got mad he wasn't getting any money) so she ran away to the hotel (they mentioned money and needing a doctor) and George doesn't like the camera cause the truth will come out and Pearl wants revenge for her treatment, they maybe even cursed each other because of the fear and hatred they had for each other and can't let go of that which is trapping them
Not a fan of these types of videos, coming from someone whose believe in ghosts/sprits/entities. I always tell people to not ask for something they can’t handle. But I’m watching it since my goorls are in it.
Ugh i just literally love u guys 🥲🥰💕
Go to Dagames cuz I don't think he would mind 😊
Not gonna lie, a bit too chaotic to watch without fast forwarding a bit because the constant loud commentary was annoying and it takes away from the vibe of Sam and Colby themselves.    Would love to see a more chill set of guests next time.
HIII
yes i’m earlyish
i live in alton and me and my boyfriends brother tried finding y’all, i hope it was fun ❤
This video was crazy omg! I want them to bring the triplet boys to a haunted place that would be an amazing video to watch. But this video was crazy low key made me scared to sleep tn lmao 😂
3:45 reminded me of that one scene in Carrie.
This was more funny than scary because of Rae and Leslie 😭
Man I feel so bad for pearl, almost made me cry 😭
They should bring Micheal reeves next
I really wanna see the beta squad colab with you guys
Yesss literally made my evening knowing you guys posted xx love u Sam and colby stay safe ❤
I want you guys to do a video with the sturnilio triplets weve been waiting to see this happened and i think you should bring larray aswell because they are very good friends and i think they would really enjoy being with you guys :)
Omg yall and the sturniolo triplets would be mindblowin in 2024
Two hours since it came out
Is it weird I also felt sick watching this. It’s so weird but I’m very nauseous
THE MATCHES WERE SENDING ME IN AN ORBIT 😭😭😭
How old are you Sam and Colby
You should bring twin paranormal here #twin paranormal❤
So cool!! I’m in Illinois and that’s only 3 hours away from where I am.
They said they never had a rock thrown at them, idk if they were just saying that, but they did at the haunted hospital (the one with Seth) just saying. But I love you Sam and Colby🫶✖️
I the only one that saw some eyes that were white💀
Thought about moving to Alton Illinois to go to SIUE next year.. never mind😂
26:28 dude out of context thats crazzy 😂
I claim no negative engery  or good engery from this vidoes and my familie doesnt Either
Im half awake but this is amazing
Sam and Colby look at the 15:55 there's a shadow behind 2 of your friends
IM IN ALTON WHAT IM SCREAMING
The moment I’ve been waiting for!!!!!
My fav ghost hunters I learn alot from you guys ❤
last video of 2023 what a crazy year...
I’ve been to Alton so many times because I live really close and I’ve heard many ghost stories about Alton especially after the flood and most of them are about the mineral springs hotel and more about the pyramids south of Alton called the Cahokian mounds in east St. Louis
okay in pearl's room the "there was no option" could be referring to the way she ended her life not to what george did that's why the next thing was "no"🤓☝🏻
THIS IS THE EARLIEST IVE BEEN KFMFMFSsSd
This comment was posted at 6:42 pm
30:10 "Just doesn't fell good" 30:13 Sam: " It's about to get worse" :)
Love how you guys are so full of energy and having fun and at the same time series 😂
Congratulations Sam & Colby yall in there & happy holidays ❤❤🎉

I was dieing in laughter when they started saying bye to harry, Tina and all of them when they were headed to pearls room
ok i NEED Leslie and Rae to do this again this was PHENOMENAL
all my fav people <3
In 2024 I gotta see Sam and Colby take Sapnap and Tubbo and the Triplets to a spooky place!
I am so excited for what’s to come next year!! It’s officially been 4 years since I started watching you guys and I’m SO excited to continue watching you guys and see what’s to come!!!
You guys are the best ❤❤
please do a collab with the boys!!! (Juicyfruitsnacks, EddieVR, YourNarrator, Joshdub, and Mully) it would be so much fun!!!
I’ve never seen a YouTuber being sponsored by Universal🧍🏻‍♀️ But 100% understand why Sam and Colby have the honor to do so
You guys were like 30 minutes away from me wtf NO ONE ever comes here
I LOVE THIS VID AND I LOVE YALL❤❤
Thanks guys for another awesome investigation as always you don't disappoint
Gave you guys a pass faking vids when still in your late teens, but when u go on Rogan and claim all your recent experiences are legit and now you guys got exposed in the uncut video with evidence having some things set up. Your partners got looked into after Satori n Amanda was embarrassingly debunked but if ever believed her u were a moron. Hard to even trust those flash lights anymore plus your guys excitement strangely went down using them.
Did colby just pause the recording to his balls???💀😭
@Sam and Colby. How is your cancer treatment going?
2 hours ago!!
not leslie checking her pulse KEKW, cool video i don't usually watch content like this, but i had to for my queens!!
Okay, crazy thought. The Alice Box mentions the name Michael, and you guys mentioned the guides incident with being pushed out of the way to avoid being hurt. There is an arch angel named Michael who is known to defend people from evil, so could that have been who pushed the guide out of the way?
You neeeed to collab with two girls one ghost please please please
Put Dream and Ranboo on an investigation
Little Apricot, you should take her
COLLAB WITH THE BOYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
yall should do more locations with them cause they seem genuinely scared and that could mean they could be more vulnerable to paranormal activity with fear which means more content for us😂
26:28 Your WHAT is off? Rae???   jkjk I know what she meant but I was studying and listening to the video and that’s the first thing I heard lmao. I had to rewind it for context to make sure I wasn’t crazy 😂😂😂  Sam and Colby this was such a good video I love seeing my two worlds come together for a collab. I hope you guys can get Syk, Ludwig, Tina and Miyoung next for more spooky adventures 🖤  Also Leslie’s reaction to the the dual estes was priceless I need her back on for more videos 😂😂
omg that estes method section was the SCARIEST!!! i do believe in paranormal stuff and i could not go here omg
Pls go on a adventure with Tommy and jack again
This episode was so awesome & so funny great chemistry the girls did really good. I hooe you guys do an investigation with some of your fans I would so be down & do an alone challenge for 45 min.  You guys are great Have a Happy New Year's & be safe guys❤❤❤❤ Much Love to You all!
I would totally do any of y’all’s invitations with yall! But I would shit my pants
The best Birthday present in my opinion lol. ❤
I think we need to see Michael & Lily next.
Sam and Colby we NEED y’all to bring @Caspersight with y’all on a investigation! I’m sure he’d make the trip to America for a video with you guy’s.
I’ve been waiting for this for such a long time 😭😭
Mrbeast
2:23
I LIVE HERE!!!!
Do the Beverly halls house
Sam and Colby I always love how your videos are over an hour long every time
HI
THIS IS LITERALLY 2 HOURS AWAY FROM WHERE I LIVE!!!!
Brooo I'm so happy y'all posted again!
Im a big fan of your videos my number one fav YouTuber ❤❤❤
here for fusrae !!!
You guys should invite @Brittnay_Broski to a spooky adventure 👀
having markiplier on the sam and colby chanel would just hit different there would not be a day that i wouldnt watch that video ong😭😭((tytysm Sam and Colby :3))
Hope side eye guy reacts to this too ✌🏻
This video was the best I really love those girl and I like how they were talking to the cousins and I also like how Colby and the girl were arguing back and forth like that was crazy 😮😮😮
you guys should Definity collab with chandler riggs
I really wanna see you guys investigate the comedy store
you guys should bring k-pop idols Felix and Hyunjin
Petition to bring Kris and celena back :
Please do your next video in Minnesota!!!!
“You guys hear the red pod outside”😂😂😂
I’m a medium and I went to Alton because my friend lives there. There is an abandoned hospital there and it would be worth your time to check it out.
OMGG FINALLY U POSTED A NEW VIDEOO
They already played that game in the old trap house (on sam chanel)
Only Illinois people can like this
So proud of you guys for getting sponsored by universal and love this video ❤
When Colby said “He stole it” during the double Estes method, I think it was pearl referring to her husband taking her wedding ring from her after seeing her for the first time after she died.
You guys should take me to a haunted place, like a really scary place i’m up for a challenge😂
The fact that universal pictures sponsored it is beyond amazing
i’m so late my freaking notifications didn’t go on but, i can’t believe you guys got sponsored by universal! it’s officially gonna be 5 years! thank you for all you guys do for us and we love you.❤️🖤
You guys got sponsored by a moive? Thats crazy!
I feel like in pearls room its more of colby talking because pearls husband wasnt letting her talk due to him being abusive
Nice video ❤
Go to skin walker island plzzzzz I beg of u
26:30 " Vibe Reader " & " Vibrator " Sound too damn similar lmaooo or is it " Vibe Radar "
Omgggg i was so excited for this collab!!! I love fuslie so much and this is a crossover i never expected. So excited to watch this video!!! AHHHH
if you can get Joe rogan or Matt Rife that be funny and interesting
Thanks guys for the love and support
They did so good though 😁 that's my streamer!
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE DR. MIKE AND MAMA JONES COLLAB

08:36 PURPLE GUY!?
I wish you guys would take fans on your ghost videos.... i think most people would love to experience it x
I BEG FOR SAM AND COLBY AND THEBOYS COLAB
Y’all and the Fear& hosts would be hilarious and amazing content! Plsss
I'm sorry but colbys little sassy stance around 41:33 is killing me 😂 he looks like he's ready to ask for the manager
Yesss best way to end the year!! Hope everyone has a blessed and healthy 2024 🎉🤍
If you invite the Boys for a video in 2024 it would be insane!
Oml you guys need to take lazarbeam on one of these ghost hunts Fr. I swear if you do I would be sooo freaking happy!!!❤❤❤
Sam and Colby starting my interest in the supernatural and I could not be happier it's scary but fun
Now we reallllly really need more horror game players to go hunting with the boys HEHEHHEHE
I started crying on Christmas  when I opened my gift and seen it was there merch
My name is Cassie😭
Can I be your friend🥺
The one and only triplets pls pls pls NICK MATT AND CHRIS! Everyone was talking about it a couple of months ago! Pls i feel like y’all would get along very well
I am surprised people knew about this haunted place near me for how rural of an are this is
2 HOURS AGO
Tbf I have those exact same matches an they are a pain in the ass to light
It crazy how they started out as a 5 / 10 and 6 /10  then change to a 9 / 10 and 8 /10
I personally don't belive in ghost stuff like this but these videos are always really interesting
Sam and Colby NEED THE TRIPLETSSS
I love you guys so much yall are my favorite youtubers
i kind of want them to take thomas sanders with them cause that would be a collab
This was crazy asf Sam ik that u will not wanna do this but I wanna see Katrina in one of y’all videos again just 1🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
my favorite people
Did anyone else notice Colby looking behind at the stairs, during the ritual when he wasn't supposed to at 41:40? I'm not completely sure but that may have been the reason it didn't end up working?
This episode was cool and creepy
this looks so fun omg. next year you guys should go tower of London or Hampton court
Love your work guys. You should collab with the sidemen.
I need to see a Sam and Colby vid with Sapnap and Dream. It would be fun to see Dream, who doesnt believe in the paranormal, to try it out. And then Sapnap because well SAPNAP >:D
anyone beta squad x sam + colby?!!
I saw a shadow run behind you guys at 21mins and 22
THEYY POSTEDDDDD
Please get Ludwig and QT on one of these!
More demon hunting with all 4 of you please 😅
they gotta go somewhere with the sturniolos
motionless in white
I literally live less than 30 minutes away from this town and I've been there before. The way my jaw DROPPED when they said Alton, Illinois
You guys need to make shirts for people who have gone on investigations with you that say "I survived a Sam and Colby video"
Sam and Colby should go to a haunted place with The Boys!
I’m watching this about an hour after it was made🎉 so I’m one of the first ones/thousands to watch first
Please, for the love of God, don't ever have screaming girls on again.
im dead you know their def from LA bc they don't have coats for November 😂😂😂😂
I was so into the convo with george and then colby says he hears “on god…” bruhhhh
WHERES THE ICONIC SAM AND COLBY MUSIC?????????
phasmophobia is the fear of ghosts oooooooooooooooooooooo
I think that since this video is about an abused woman, it would be great to remember that no woman deserves to be abused, badly treated, or offended by any person, no matter how important you think you are, you probably aren't.
I just want to say it doesn't matter if someone doesn't or does come from tik Tok you don't need to say whoever did it didn't come from tik Tok is allowed to like this comment or whoever did come from tik Tok is allowed to like this comet you don't need to do that every single time  STOP
AAAAHHHHHH HIIIIII❤❤❤❤ YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST EVER!❤
this year was amazing and i love your content it makes me believe even more but i would like to see coryxkenshin on your channel but anyways love you guys keep doing what you do :)
Leslie was too funny🤣🤣🤣
Would love to see you guys go to some Japanese haunted locations? And Poveglia island in Italy!!
I think Sam and Colby with the boys aka Eddie,Mully,Narrator,Josh,and juicy would be a hilarious video and I am proud that u got a sponsor from universal!!!
Hi, i was wondering if it is possible to tell you that I might have found a cool haunted place in the Netherlands called 'Huis Binnenveld' translation house Insidevield, I've never been there myself but it seemed cool so i thought I'd share it with you guys😅.
I’ve had a horrible day today and this video, just this single video has made my day so much better! Thank you so much for putting all of your time and effort into making these videos!
fuk yeh another video
1:00:52 Satoru Gojo
I love you guys but bring back Celina and Kris or anyone else besides these two
you guys need to start doing abandoned explorations again!!
You should take the Sturniolo triplets next time!!!!! Would love to see a video with them!
@badbishlily

I hope that everyone has a great new year if you want I wanna know what your new years goal is?
I REALLY REALLY WANT TO COLAB WITH YOU GUYSSSSS
Can’t believe they were in my town
Leslie is such a funny person, never expected them to be in a ghost hunting video lol
Literally love this vid. Also universal sponsoring someone is just so funny to me.
Ik this is too late for you too see but having iambrandonfarris and cam would be amazing 😁 also love you guys btw
Bro what is that shadow at the window at 16:00
Letssssss gooooo new video hype
She flipped the camera off
January 5th is one day after my birthday💀
Would love to see you guys collab with @OmarGoshTV And the Fam
At 37:57 a pair of glowing eyes opens up in the right doorway and closes as they enter the pool room
Not to scary anyone but when they started to do the experiment where they can’t turn around two glowing eyes were there after they heard a crash
Also y'all should try to colab with the Dobre brothers.....
take Ireland Boys Production with u guys
Finally the wait is over 🙌 last video of 2023. Cant wait to see whats comming next. Love u guys and love ur work ❤
i am honestly convinced these guys will talk to satan
Yall should do a video with Cold Ones, feel like that would be an amazing video.
Ok but whats these rituales yall be doing now? Lol
Colby was obviously voicing Pearl and (i forgot her name soz) was George.  Like, it was so obvious from how they were talking XD
big props on leslie and rae dude i could never do this
this was a collab i was NOT expecting omg
OMG YOU ARE IN MY HOME STATE❤❤❤
You guys are the best
Can we get Philza and Tubbo or Charlie Slimecicle and Ranboo?
What if they did a video next year with aphmau :C I feel like that would be cool lol in my honest opinion bc she can be jumpy xD
Love this video so much
1 million likes is another trip with rae and leslie!
You guys made me chuckle a lot, as usual, in this one, but one of my favorite parts was the siren outside and Colby like, "Do you guys hear that REMpod outside"? I don't know that made me laugh so hard. Also, I was really excited to see a video on New Year's Eve eve! I didn't think we'd get another video this year!
Am I the only one that wants to see @DanTDM do one of these? I think it'd be so cool to see him in one of these
I want them to take the sidemen on a ghost hunt. It would be funny af
Should get OLight to sponsor you and get some serious flashlights
That is absolutely crazy and it's funny bc I live in Missouri and you are an hour away from melee aggghhh
Sam and Colby be collecting collabs with gamers like my brother be with pokemon
Y’all should check out Pythian castle for sure
56:50 ghost was a tinakitten fan
Cool video Sam and Colby! 👍
2 HOURS LATE!!!!!
I love your videos but y’all really don’t need the rituals.  I mean do what you want but I think they are unnecessarily dangerous especially with guests.
BIGGEST FAKERS ON YOUTUBE
Y’all are awesome ❤
Go to India guys or Mexico do a season in one or another! Just you two!!
Anyone else find them one day and are obsessed now
There are two people who do reactions to your videos that I think would be awesome to join in on one of your videos. @jcatsarts and @zowoki
YOU WERE 20 MINUTES AWAY. WISH I COULD HAVE MET YOU GUYS! i hope you enjoyed alton
When the Alice Box gave the name "Michael" and "boat", all I could think about was  the "Michael rode the boat ashore, hallelujia" song.   And this Estes Method was SO freakin' intense! The girls did a fantastic job.
Dude I LITERALLY live an hour and a half away from this place and have been (and climbed) the mound there. That's INSANE
i love how sam and colby are both way more scared of the bugs than the spirits😂😂
Finally!!! Y'all take ages to post!!
Guys I love youuu You are my favorite YouTubers ever
It’s wild that Leslie was standing right behind those chairs and touching them.
Sam and Colby I heard The Boys were interested in making collab
Alone at my place, 3 am and watching this 🙃
PLEASE CONTACT THE BOYS I THINK YK WHO THEY R YOU WENT ON A CALL WITH THEM!! Their name are Eddie,mully,juicy,narrator,Josh (their channel names)PLEASE DO IT WITH THEM IT WOULD BE SO COOL😈🤩✌️🤗
Love watching u guys Sam and Colby y’all are the best
2h ago🎀
Sam and Colby are the best
pls take ldshadowlady and smallishbeans on a hunting i need to see that. rlly hope it can happen
wow, the movie is coming out on my moms birthday
I'm not sure what it is, but I can see Sam or Colby (I'm not sure who specifically at this moment) dating Fuslie. Also, Sam! I had a weird dream for the first time ever with you and Colby where I was exploring an haunted antique/thrift shop and an old white house that has a red roof. Rural area. At that house, I was warning Sam to be careful of the spores (mold). I've never seen youtubers in a dream before, so just in case, be careful?   Since I was little, I always had strange dreams and nightmares where some will come true. Thing is it might be directly telling or indirectly/symbolically telling me of something that has already happened that I'm not told of (like a secret from someone I deem close) or something that hasn't happened yet, but I will know within the moment I wake up all the way to a week. As a child, I saw a shadow figure at a childhood friend's house, over a decade later, I also saw shadow figures (a group) of children standing on a median to the left of a 3 lane road. Like it was night time outside, but it looked so real, that I actually reacted outwardly through screaming when I thought I saw something about to happen while my friend was driving me home. I know these things sound crazy.
Video idea u need to be with the boys
Is it just me or does the tour guide kinda sound like CaptainSparkles?
Sturniolo Triplets
rae and leslie are my favs and this colab is just so amazing!!! <333
Cough Cough. . . Garrett watts •.•
BRO I LIVE RIGHT UP THE STREET I WISH I COULD HAVE SEEN YOU GUYS 😭😭
I really want to see tubbo  and coypiso in here
Omggg new video
Someone's gonna clip that embalming table part and it'll spread like wildfire... 😂
You should definitely collab with Stromedy. He does similar things that you guys do except with drones. I would love to see you guys collab with them.
Happy new year Sam and Colby 🎉

i saw the trailer for night swim when i saw fnaf😭😭 it looks scary
yeah sam n colby gave us a great 2023, yeah.... but um.... sorry to be that person, but.... is nobody talking about the eyes in the hallway(on the right) at 37:57??? excuse me??? what on earth???? unless thats not what that is and im trippin' but SURE DOES LOOK LIKE SOMEONE'S BEAUTIFUL EYEBBALLS
I have a question, can y'all do a stream sometime?

If you guys do another guest video after this try rackaracka cause of the semi new horor film they made “ Talk to me”

Colbys bébé is everything
I was in Alton Illinois literally like 2 months ago
Heyyy Samantha And Colleen  Only real friend would know!!
so uh, are you guys just gonna ignore the cody/satori being total bullsht or what? do you plan on addressing it or what? they've been completely debunked by MANY MANY MANY channels... and disowned by the real paranormal community.
Can you go to the town Jim Thorpe in PA
Y’all need to get coryxkenshin here id love to see that
leslie: whats his name? the good guy that throws rocks. colby: MICKEY. oh-
1:44 best transition EVER
Come on you have to do ISHOWSPEED
Can we start getting actual ghost hunters back on with Sam and Colby?! I get over seeing these randoms pulled in and carrying on like idiots
i love when leslie and sam were genuinely freaking out as rae and colby did the estes method 😭😭
The last and one of the best video videos ever ❤can’t wait for the videos in 2024 🎉😻
OMG JANUARY 5 IS MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!
Love your Videos ❤❤ I am apsest with the Story 🤌
#SamandColby my recommendations are the #MetaPsyckicks 2 mediums.  They've been on With #MackieandAmanda a few times
Sam and colby should do a collar with the boys, the boys also recently went to the same haunted light house they did
I SCRESMED WHEN I SAW THEY POSTED
This has to be one of the funniest videos with guests that Sam and Colby has done, great way to end the year and Happy New Year in advance everyone🎉❤😂

Take Charles and Alyssa!! Or Montana and Ryan!
sam and colby should do a gaming colab with OTV and play phasmophobia
Universal studios 🫣 sponsor?
yessssssssssssssssss i love you
@jamescharles please collab
U guys should get twin paranormal
1:00:05 I have a feeling that this chair was considered “empty” by the SLS device since this chair was a different model than the other two that were occupied. Also the two larger chairs seem to have a better “humanly figure” while the smaller chair that was empty was likely deemed impossible to be a humanly figure to draw out. Thoughts on this?  Edit: I 100% believe in ghosts but I just don’t think this reader was very accurate
@Sam and Colby Look at 16:00 because there’s a shadow behind you guys trust me
38:00 what are those light things in the right corner it looks like eyes , you just hosted spirits in and then i see that i hope it was something else
Sam and colby should collab with kelsi davies
the way im from alton-
You guys should go to the Jefferson hotel
PLEASE TAKE MARKIPILER
PLEASE DO A VIDEO WITH THE STURNIOLO TRIPLETS
This is Timmy 👦 👕 👖 Every like he gets he grows up by 1 year How old will he get?

7:11 ghost caught in the background by the door
An hour early woo hoo 🎉❤
The last Estes Method was crazy, it sent chills down my spine. Love your videos, can’t wait for more from 2024!
16:00 what's that in the window? 😮
Can you go Poveglia, Italy Venice apparently it’s the most haunted place in the world
Then: AGHH SPIDER! Australia: aw hey Bob, oh that's tiny.
People who like Sam and Colby ❤❤❤❤

@imbrandonfarris would pay to see you n them do this
Hi Sam and Colby I really can’t believe I been watching y’all for about 5 going on 6 years now
Leslies reaction to everything was awesome 😂🫶
37:58 it looks like there are 2 white eyes in the dark hallway on the right of the screen
I should start getting famous in youtube so i can get into one of your videos
I love how they thought it was for hanging pigs i thought it too😘
Thank you for an amazing year!!! LOVE rae and Leslie!!!! Stanley hotel pt 2 in 2024 ....?
You guys are my favorite YouTubers I love your videos 😄
TWINS PARANORMAL WOULD BE AN AWESOME COLLABORATION 👻💚🖤
This was amazing I hope yall have a good new year and a good day
Sam and Colby should do a team up vid w Dream and GorgeNotFound
Sam and colby I'd you read this  were I live in douglas Arizona a lot.of people say that a hotel called the garden hotel is haunted I'm wondering if you could go and search if it is real.
Yo Sam and colby collab with the boys they have been lately ghost hunting
I live in Alton Illinois
You guys have to get Joe Weller and Elliot Crawford on one of these videos!! It would be so good
Sorceries
it would be really funny to see xQc do this 🤣
You should do a video with the sturniolo triplets
nle choppa and kai ceant  they will love it
I JUST WOKE UP
Yall need to take LAURENZSIDE! I commented on one of her videos with the idea once and she liked the comment to she’d be down I think!
The part of the ritual they did wrong was going into the room or strike the matches more than once
I can’t believe I’m watching a video of Sam and Colby in my town 🤯
Try get Daltoosh on I feel like he’d bring some crazy vibes to the whole thing funny dude too
Who remembers the hosting game from the trap house.
people who love sam and colby 👇🏽
Not Colby turning around constantly during the “party” tho
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO EARLYY
You should bring typical gamer
Colby was so concerned when she wasn't feeling good.❤ 7:54
I was expecting more of a scary video lmao ..but this was okay 😂😂 push her Leslie puuuush her lmfao
We need the Sturniolo Triplets in a video ASAP
37:57 am I tripping or did eye just appear in the doorway
I can't imagine what its like to be sponsored by Universal
In 2024
I was locked 🔒 up on Christmas ain’t get to see me 🥷 ain’t get to hug my mama 👩couldn’t even give her no kisses can’t even post on my instagram cause these’d 🐱🥷 be snitching.
i love you guys so much =)
I was literally watching older videos, clicked on the channel to find another and saw that you guys and posted and didn't notice for a whole 2 hours what am i doing
I would love seeing Ludwig doing a ghost hunt that would be so fun to watch
My sister's met you around 5 AM.
@sturniolotriplets PLS COLLAB❤❤❤❤
Pewdiepie 😊
46 mins in box said chair she was in the chair with the box....y'all didn't call that out lol right before box said prayer
The way I was literally in Alton today… literally drove over the bridge twice
Somebody please explain to me the shadow shift at Sam's feet at 42:29.  How did this happen? You hear a "click like" sound and then the shadow just moves.
WHO ELSE NEEDSSS THEM TO COLLAB WITH THE STURNIOLO TRIPLETSSS! 👇
damn
Merry Christmas and happy new year my friends! It is December 30th. Stay safe, everyone in the comments, Sam and Colby, and all of Sam and Colbys special guests.❤🎉
i really need to see sam and colby with dan and phill, i will be healed and that will just be the funniest video ever
OMG DID YALL SEE THE WINDOW SHADOW SOMEONE STANDING UP AT 16:00 OR 16:01 ?!😮
@markiplier to go with you guys
Sam and Colby pls take me and my bsf with y’all we’re young but pls it would be a memory I’d never forget😭🙏
Weird… My name is Michael and my mom is Carol
Loves Colby
I've been waiting for this one ever since rae leaked it! This video was a lot lighter, warmer, and familiar due to rae and leslie. For the most part i was waiting to see their reactions and leslie's new bestie lou, i wasn't disappointed or surprised loll 🙃❤️
Don’t get me wrong, I love these type of videos❤ but I prefer when there is no guests involved. I feel like the guests are a distraction, a lot of chaos and it takes away the scariness ahah
They should go on a investigation with LaurenZside
This video was really amazing! Also this might be a stretch, but during the "party" when the Alice Box said things like "November" which might be referencing to what happened a year ago with the guide and the wall, and it also said "Michael" and immediately I just thought about like the archangel Michael which is (I think) one of the strongest guardian angels and the guide said it might be a guardian angel that pushed him. Just a thought. Great video though! Can't wait to see what's in store for 2024!
alton is only 2hrs from where i live 😭😭
SAM COLBY Y'ALL WHERE 45 MINUTES AWAY FROM MEEEEEEEEEEEE OMG I'M  FREAKING OUT
Ah I love the girls! They are so fun and make this video so much lighter. ❤
Woah! What a great video.. I'd love to go with you guys ghost hunting. Even if it is scary... I grew up in a  haunted house, and I seen some crazy things. I think it would be super interesting. 😊❤
Sam and Colby, you guys posted this vid on my birthday!
watching this while wearing my xplr merch
Thanks Sam for staying up all night to get this video out today!! You guys are one my favorites ❤
That Estes was so good 😁🙌
30:22 made me choke on my food 🤣
FINNALY U GUYS CAME BACK
Love you guys!!!
The amount of times they kind of, almost turn around during the party is unnerving.
SAM ND COLBY MEETS THE BOYS WOULD BE SUCH A VIBE !!!!!!
I’m using a hammer as a stylist
Next time take Sykkuno he is friends with Rae and Leslie he would be funny there
Hearing my name over and over lowkey tripped me out 😂😂
i wish i could come with you guys even though i am only 11, and i watched all your videos
sam: "the only rule for this whole hour is we cant look back " *colby looking back 4 minutes later*

you NEEEEEED to go ghost hunting with literally lizz & got ghost!! they are super cool people!!
You should definitely take Tubbo and Tommy somewhere.
We not gonna talk about rae saying her vibrator isnt on
Am Mia and my Number is 7
I was watching this video while preparing some decorations and I absolutely loved it Also they make a perfect squad love the video ❤ and can we talk about how hilarious they are. Sam:”I’m a woman 😧“
Sup
Literally me at school when colby walks up the stairs!!
Did anybody else notice the two pair of lights that look like eyes in 37:57 … it could js be something else but that’s creepy.
Can't wait to see the debunkers read this video to filth.
lets go
OMG!!!!! YOU GOT VALKYRAE IN FOR THE HUNT :D EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE PLEASE GET MORE GAMERS IN !!!!
I should totally be invited next y'all😔😔/ half joke, would be funny tho-
Y’all should go to circus circus in la go to room 666 room 123 and go to the 13th floor
Yesssss i love u guysss
I live in Alton I wish I could've seen you guys
right as Fuslie and Valkyrae were about to go in alone i checked the time and it was 3:33 on my phone, I am still BLOWN AWAY by the timing (literally)
I just woke up it’s 4:30pm so sadly I’m an hour late to this video😂 but Sam and Colby I love you to so much it’s insane to think I’ve been here since vine. I was 8 and now I’m turning 18 and I’m graduating🤯 thank you for always being there when I need to smile😊🖤
Hiiiiiiiiiii
I can't believe he killed a daddy long legs. Unbelievable.
Real life Phasmophobia no wayyy
Leslie such a content machine, love her.
am i crazy or did Sam play The Hosting Game by himself when they lived in the trap house?!?!
Bros are sponsored by universal fukin crazy
At 37:57 you can see glowing eyes in the right door frame where there weren't before. Creepy! And right after the ritual starts!?
Hey Sam & Colby, Im Such A Fan Of You, i want to be like you guys sometime, i'd like to meet you both but im england, wish u goodluck to both of you in this video
i would die to do the estes method with sam and colby! looks so fun n probs scary
This is the last people I thought they would bring on. When I seen the thumbnail that they posted before the video was out, I was so siked. I love gaming and the paranormal. This is amazing, I love it.😌🫶🏼♥️
I would love to see you guys team up with Garrett Watts and Andrew Siwicki!
You guys should come investigate Gettysburg!!! You guys would love it! 💯👌🏻
Pin me poop
You should have the roomies next time
<3
51:22 I love how Colby said but there so cute and little
I’ve also experienced something paranormal or at least that’s what my sister told me, she said that we used to have these dolls and put them in the closet once we went to sleep, we would put them on like a shelf in the closet and close the door, then the nest day they would be on the floor outside the closet with I think the closet door closed and so after a while of that happening me and my sister were terrified and so due to that my brother ripped off the dolls head and threw them out
They never fail to entertain us, another banger of Sam and Colby
COLLAB WITH CORY KENSHIN PLSSSS I BEG
Bro you should Collab with mr beast
26:30 ayo rae what you say 🤣😭😭😭
Are you guys coming to the UK next year
Didnt know this was coming out till i saw it on instergram an amazing video loved watching it i definatly think i saw an orb or something when they where in the pool i absolutly loved watching this though and cant wait to make some edits showing things people have missed and put together the sam and colby 2023 complimatuon with all the cool fun things that have happened in your videos in 2023 happy new year everbody!!!!
I love yall😂
If a ghost threw rocks at me I’d start screaming while throwing rocks everywhere back
This is an amazing video and all the different energy in the different rooms is amazing
@41:00 I never realized how weird it would be to have the same name as the person they're calling out to lol
👍👍👍
Sam and colby I love your vids im a huge subscriber I've got a whole collection of your merch😍😍😍😃😃😃
I'm not terrified of ghosts, I'm terrified of the images Sam and Colby put in their videos randomly 🤣
I hope they do skz tbh <3333
8:37 😂😂😂
ive been watching sense atleast 2019 maybe older
Hiii Sam and Colby me and my godmother.  Are huge fans of you guys ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hiiiiiiiii love your vids
when i was watching this i felt like i couldn't turn around too
He literally looked behind him so yeah
There is a shadow at 16:00 in the window💀
PLS PLS DO QUACKITY AND WILBUR AGAINNNNN
That was such a good video, I was worried for them during the match lighting/host game, I love them so much
Can yall stop having horrible people on your channel
Also, y’all need to stop joking around especially if it’s about the deceased and take things seriously.
In 37:57 are those eyes in the right door?
I'm not from USA I'M from south africa so I can't buy your match 😢❤can you ship it to Africa 😢❤
love you that was sceriy
As someone who lives fairly close to this area, it always amuses me to see people go there because it's ALTON 😭🤣 iykyk
Well hello guys🥰
Omg that was sooo good I love u guys so much ur soo funny can't wait for next vid I so merch for Christmas and happy new yr 🎉
i wanna see @ifreemz do some ghost hunting. haha
garrett watts!!! I think it would be funny
Sam and Colby should do a collab with the boys (Eddie, narrator, Josh, mully, and juicy) it would amazing😭😭😭😭 (amazing vid btw happy new years)
Maybe the sls camera was picking up the anomalys based on what the chairs look like. If u watch it back u can see that the figures r almost exactly identical and they are only in the middle and right chair(which look identical) and the chair on the left is a different chair. Just an observation 🤷‍♂️
The way I was cracking up when they kept backing away and Colby just kept saying “an another step forward.”
nic
I’m so excited you two posted! This was honestly my early birthday wish for y’all to post and you did! Love y’all and stay safe ❤❤❤
love it
Rae:I think the spiders are the least of our problems Me: girl the ghost are the least of MY problems 😂😂😬😐
You should take @Cjya and @Dellapikmin. they arent really big YouTubers but i would love to see them go.
Love this team up! But just to note; John Wayne Gacy did not kill anyone in a clown suit. The clown suit was a side job he did for fun, had nothing to do with his murders, but a lot of people have that misconception.
These guys were in Alton I live like 30 mins from Alton wtf
Ayyyyyy we live in Alton!!
Hey guys, love the videos. i get these videos take i while but i need more videos😂😭
YES I HAD A FEELING YALL POSTED!!!!!!!

You Should get the abnormal club guys to do a vid with you because their fans of you and really want to meet you and they do content like you do

I’m so excited I love watching Sam and Colby I have watched every single video they posted
For some reason, the story that the guide said that he got hit by these white light, somehow reminds me of the guiding light from doors.
My sound keeps cutting in and out only on this video
Hey Sam hey Colby my dog had to be put down today due to liver cancer and I just wanted to say your videos cheer me up so much thank yu!
Can you do a video with BigT and Larry Croft
im casually watching this on my birthday with dim sum. One day me and my friends going to drag more friends to do some ghost hunting.

At 22:13 if you look closely you can see something move cross behind the girls
Bro you guys are the best
I love you guys and videos. I'd to see more of Kris and Selena
Rae and Leslie were awesome, should have them again.. What a great collab my favorite Duo, and my favorite gamers..
Where’s the “WHATS UP GUYS ITS SAM AND COLBY!!”? All I heard was “what’s up guys it’s Sam and Colby.”like what😭
Pretty sure I saw this in ma dreams, I dunno
@Courtreezy i feel like she would be great!!!
Tithetatman
This was such a nice Collab .WOW🎉
sam and dean are better
“no other option” in the esthes method sounds more like pearl instead of george, like her only option out was to commit
I dont think you will answer me but will you ever make a hounted video with "the boys" i seen theyr vidoes they get more activities than you like they got more activoties like more door slaming on camera baby crying😮or toher shit like...well its bit weird that they get kinda bit more activities than you do...im notsaying anything mean but i love your vidoes and the boys channel vidoes and it would be great to make a hounted vidoe with the boys it would be funny cool and scary at the same time😂❤btw be careful in places like these its really dangerous....❤❤❤love you colby and sam and your other friends whatveer theyr names are😅❤❤❤❤❤
do a video with george clarke and arthur tv in the uk
my friend eva has a crush on colby she is only 9 and loves makeup and have a wonderfull happy new year
Wait it might be cause they said does anyone wanna sit in the middle chair 🤷‍♂️
Feels illegal how I clicked on this video 9 minutes after it came out 😵‍💫
This literally made my day 100× better ily guys❤
Why do they sound like kids who say oh yah thats the guy from fortnite like literally they and saying oh yah thats from phasmophobia
i love how sam and colby never fail to put a smile on our faces love them so much!
The spirit you were talking to in the beginning obviously just wanted to talk to the girl in the white beanie but you guys didn’t seem to pick it up. He answered her right away and pretty much ignored everyone else
I'm loving every video sam and colby make keep crushing it guys
LAST SAM AND COLBY VIDEO IN 2023
This collab was a big crossover for me, Leslie and Rae are so funny haha. Big props all around!!
Are you not inviting satori and her gifted fella to anymore investigations

LEAVING THE GIRLS INVESTIGATE IS SO REAL😂😂
1:08:49 secs of sam and colby giving rae and leslie nightmares for life😭

Sam and Colby you need to look at your last video of Celina’s house at 11:57 ( not in this video!!!!! But in Celina’s house video!!!!!)  there is a scrawny shadow figure behind Celina in your picture. It is in the door way in the background. It is insane😮 it looks like it wearing a hat

1:03:01 I think the "he stole it" during the Estes might be about the wedding ring that he took from Pearls dead body
Hey guys, if you plan on traveling abroad for 2024 investigations, India has some really haunted places, if you are interested in investigating 🕵🏻‍♂️
HIII

Been waiting for this since they posted the vid a Colinas house just been checking if they posted every hour till now
UNIVERSAL can be DARTH VADER! At the Conjuring house you two uncovered a huge understanding of our reality, of our existence! Which Conjuring House experience will UNIVERSAL persue ?
YOU SHOULD MAKE A VIDEO WITH LAURENZSIDE!!!
You guys should go to the Chneney Manison in Jerseyville IL.
never heard of a fuckin haunted pool but im here for it and dude THERE IS ALWAYS A WILLIAM IN THESE HAUNTED PLACES MAN. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE
Definitely one of the best ways to end off 2023🎉❤
AAAAAAA I LIVE HERE
Im sorry, hold up, Michael I think refers to an arch angel??? You mentioned a bright light that pushed the guide out of the way, and how it might be a guardian angel or something? Im sorry im probably wrong but this is a big possibility
Could you guys collaborate with kubz scouts?
I love you guys!
YESS HI FROM ILLINOIS
You guys should take ranboo on a investigation. You guys should also go to the paris catacombs.
I have a request why don t you guys stay for a week in sallies house all the way from south africa

Leslie and rae are so funny
i kinda want to see them take a christian with them to one of these really haunted places, since they experience so much activity at a lot of these places with entities and ghosts and spirits, it would be interesting to see what would happen if a person of God was with them
I screamed YIPPEEEE when I saw this
I WAS WAITING FOR A NEW VIDEO FOR 200000 YEARS

Happy new year
I love you guys and happy new year and this made me laugh. I love you guys thank you for always making me laugh. I love you guys.❤❤❤
This has gotta be the funniest one yet 😭
This was a crazy investigation 🙀 The Hosting Game was terrifying
You guys should explore end and Lorraine house
1:04:25 AYO what did he say??🤨
I'm so freaking excited for this!!
Ya'll should do one with the boys.
People always get Gacy's story so hilariously wrong 😅
It would be cool if you did one with The Boys ( Mully, Josh, Narrator, Juicy, and Eddy). Love your content, the first time I watched one of your videos was this year on my birthday when I was home alone.
Who else got 0 sleep for 2+ days??
OMG THIS WAS SO COOL AND GOOD I LOVED IT❤❤ JUST 😍 THE VID I LOVE ABT THE FACT THEY STILL LAUGH WHILE BAD THINGS ARE GOIBG ON🤣🤣😭😭🤣🤣
I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS AND KNOWING THAT SAM AND COLBY ARE BEING SPONSORED BY UNIVERSAL IS CRAZY
Piral overdosed and she is saying she had no choice
Thanks for the roller coaster ride of 2023! I'm so looking forward to watching you both in 2024! You 2 are the highlights of my day, week, and month. Thank you for all you do for us...for me!❤
U did this an hour ago!? Wow that is crazy 😆😆
Yoooooo!  You should go back to the crescent hotel! I stayed over night in the same room as you! lol anyway I have a question. Is it paranormal if your cameras at 32% and as soon as you start filming the battery goes to 0%?! Love yall! Also I have your murch!!!
Wassssssup
Sam and Colby are the BEST best friend duo
The way Leslie freaks out in Pearl room😂😂😂
POSTED 1 HOUR AGOOOOO
I'd like to see @TheMrSark go on a ghost hunt with you guys.  Would be a blast to watch.
I live in Illinois
i have waited
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING VIDEOS FOR US AND PUTTING YOURSELF IN TROUBLE FOR US. THANKS FOR MAKING US HAVE A WONDERFUL YEAR WITH YOU GUYS . LOVE YOU !!!!!!
In Colorado there is one of the most haunted roads in Colorado and it’s so haunted that nobody is allowed to live on that road because so many people have died on that road and some people call it “the gates of hell” because a man went crazy and burnt his whole mansion down while his family was sleeping inside and Riverdale Road is 11 miles long
This is like a different thing from the video but how do you get sponsored by universal pictures?😀
Guys should get Mr beast he would be so Down❤❤❤
Colby and sam please next video don't invite other people like those girls
Sam Colby I love you videos and you guys care soooooooo cool
1:03:02 it said “he stole it” and George stole her wedding ring right?
I want you two too take the sturniolos on a little adventure and you guys should maybe go on their podcast
It'd be nice to have just you two investigate more often. Having collabs just means more bodies, noise, and chaos than actual investigating. It's just an ick factor.
LESLIE AND RAE??
FINALLY YOU POSTED I MISSED U GUYS
Aaaany Leslers? 👀
❤️‍🔥🙏🏼🤘🏼🤙🏼
You should take a fan to a haunted location and I volunteer as tribute 🫡 I ain't afraid of no ghost 👻😅
Flamingo
STURNIOLO TRIPLETS OR DAZ BLACK WOULD BE SO SO SO GOOOOOD ❤❤❤❤
I will not allow anything I have seen or watched in this video harm me ,attach or be with me after watching this . Amen
I really need Brittany broski in one of these ghost hunts, that would be so funny.
I LOVE your videos so much never stop please keep following your dream
I think my favorite thing about this channel has to sam and colby just scarring there guest with ghost all while being afraid of bugs lol
omg rae!!
AYYYYYY ANOTHER VIDD😊
The sidemen

sam and colby i was wondering is you and the boys (special edd, narrator, mully, juicy and josh) would one day do a ghost hunting video like this with each other one day? but keep up the amazing work! yall take care!
@The Boys you guys have to collab with the boys
WHY IS NOO ONE TALKING ABOUT THEM BEING SPONSORED BY UNIVERSIAL PICTURE HIYS WHAT

Id be so disappointed if i was a spirit that finally got invited to a human party and they were just sitting in an empty pool in the dark getting scared when i try to start the strobe lights on the ground😂
❤❤❤❤
We need Amanda
Damn that was the last video of 2023
I could not look behind me when they where doing the sayoc
I'm sorry guys this was incredibly hard to watch. I just had to mute the sound and let the video play so that you got the watch. Still love you guys. I just didn't vibe with this video.
great video keep it up!!!
@yeptheboys hit em up and go exploring or @whatitdodave you need to go please.

Sturniolo.triplets
Very cool lets go
22:12 there is a figure that runs across the room
I finally got the xplr merchandise ahhhhh keep it up  sam and Colby we love u ❤
WOO!!
Not gonna lie, it would be kinda fun to see Tuonto and Dish on one of these videos because of all their paranormal gaming like Phasmophobia videos and they give off great energy. But this video was so amazing the energy from both Sam and Colby and Lesie and Rae were electric!
I think you should come  back, To england
Yoo Sam and Leslie would be a cute couple if she doesn’t have a bf
my two worlds colliding
Finally someone does my hometown! Born an raised in Alton Illinois
I love how they said she could bring a "friend" and Fuslie immediately offers up Valky as a sacrifice.
NO WAYYYYYYY IM GONNA CRY THANK YOU FOR THIS COLLAB OMG
At : 1:00:35 the guy on the right chair looks like he is crossing his legs... was he a therapist or smthn???? It would be sick if he was   This place is literally 2 hours away from me. I might be able to go for my birthday! My birthdays in october witch makes it even better!   Edit: just finished... maybe I don't want to go... nah I still will.
OMGGGGGG MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERSSSS. Ps. I remember when Sam did this host party ritual on his channel YEARS ago xD its such a throwback seeing him doing it in this video

i really want to see more of the SLS camera along side seeing if you can ask them questions or ask them to turn on a flashlight and see if you can see anything touching the light be it would be so coolif they did! Btw love your videos they are awesome!!!
I NEED A SAM AND COLBY COLLAB WITH JOHNNIE GUILBERT
Sam and Colby that’s like so close to where I live omg I live by Joliet
would love to see Ludwig and Stanz or Pointcrow and Smallant
You should take @Caspersight to a location. I think that collaboration would be epic.
THE GIRLS ARE SO PRETTG AFFF THEY ARE LIKE KPOP IDOLSZ OMGG
you telling me sam and colby is a 1 hour drive away from me rn bye yall road trip
With Doctor Mike it’ll be funny 😭
Y’know what, I want Matthew Patrick  (@gametheory ) to go ghost hunting, he could create a ghost theory. Him or Rachel Zegler (actress and YouTuber) OR Markiplier <3
Wow the video is soo cool but i heard you say about making people go to your Channel or join your thing so can you make funny and the crew join you guys if you don't know who those people are they're the YouTubers who go everywhere just like you but play Roblox and their Channel together is called funny and the crew?!!😅😅😅
I'll be honest, sometimes first-time ghost hunters get on my nerves, but Leslie & Rae were adorable. I love seeing people experience the paranormal for the first time! ✨️🤍🤟👻✨️
another great video
Sam & Colby you should bring @CarterSharer & @BaileyPayne on a ghost hunt with you in 2024
yall got a universal sponsorship sheeeeesh lemme get 1k lol 😂
I LOVE YOUR VIDS THEY ARE WAY TOO GOOD. WHO AGREES GO GET THEM TO 12M
You guys should bring out the lol podcast😊
I just wanted to hopefully get a message to Sam and Colby, and I wanted to say thank you so much for making these videos you make for us, you are so inspiring to me and I’m sure you are to other people as well! Before I started watching you guys I didn’t believe in paranormal or the afterlife, but ever since I have started watching you guys I believe 1000 % in spirits etc. Thank you for making me believe that life does still go on in the afterlife whether it is good or bad. Sending love from England ❤
"Maybe it's my period coming!?"💀
when do we push her in lol
I have lived 2.5 hours from here my whole life and never new this?
Tbhh I feel like it’d be cool to take sykkuno
collab with laurenzsideeee, she plays loads of horror games sam and colby and laurenzside are my all time favourite youtubers it would be such a good video
i think johnnie should go on one of these next
Bring Tubbo!
Good job, boys you did it again!👏🏻👏🏻 another great spooky video✨✨
I wanna see Jacksepticeye, Lordminion777, Muyskerm, or Markiplier do this with them. They play ghost hunt games, so it would be cool to see them do it in real life.
please bring Mark Rober to this that would be an amazing collaboration.
Pearl's story is so sad. No male or female should go through something that depressing.  EDIT: Sam forgetting the name of the game is so funny to me. This video was one of my favorites, keep up with the great work guys! :)
Can you guys explore the goldfield ghost town in Az
Sam and Colby you guys should totally collab with Deb Smikle! She is so amazing and fun I’m sure you all would have an amazing time!
People who love Sam and Colby…[<3333]
You don't drive a boat Colby you conn it! 😂
Like If someone had a pain in their stomach
THE NEW VIDEO LETS GOOOOOOO AFTER LONG TIME HAPPY AFTER CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY EARLY NEW YEARS GUYS
I have been there before to look at it because o used to live by it
Yay another video🎉
9 min late
I have recently started watching. i got really intrested and have been watching a few videos every day. this was the first fresh video that i have watched and i love it. it is so amazing and i love you guys!
This videos estes method was crazy. I heard of some haunted placed in ohio (this is some short stuff i got from an article about them)  Moonville Tunnel in McArthur   This abandoned stretch of railway leading to an old coal mining town attracts paranormal enthusiasts hoping for a glimpse the unfortunate souls killed by trains over the years. You might also see train lights or find images of Frank Lawhead* on your camera. Those hoping for these ghostly encounters can trek nearby trails, some of which are along portions of the old railroad line.   *According to legend, in 1880 train engineer Frank Lawhead was operating a train when another incoming train caused a head-on collision.  South Bass Island Lighthouse in Put-in-Bay     A favorite Ohio vacation spot has its fair share of eeriness and mystery. Reports of creepy footsteps, slamming doors and unexplained noises coming from the lighthouse may have come from a century-old mystery. During the smallpox epidemic, the story of Samuel Anderson's death was ruled a suicide after falling, jumping – or being pushed – off a cliff by the lighthouse. While the lighthouse is currently closed, you can walk the grounds.
YOU BOTH ARE NY IDOLS!! COLBY HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY AND SAM HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY!!

You should go ghost hunting with Lexi Rivera  People who agree with me 👇🏻
Like this to remind me to calm back when I calm home from the mall + I GOT XPLR MERCH AT ZUMIEZ
I remember watching sam play the hosting game on his channel in the old house in cali. time flies and its just so crazy to see it come back.
I love you so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much SAM and COLBY 💓🤩💓
THEY GOT SPONSORED BY UNIVERSAL? That feels unreal if im honest
Will u guys do a video with Eddie and Narrator.
51:29 the girls: NOOO NOT A MOUSE Colby: but they’re so cute and wittle :)
This gave me flash backs to Sam playing the midnight man game in their house… I’ve been subscribed to them for YEARS!
I came from Rae's community, I've never seen her go dead silent from fear like that before
I once lived in a house where after a fire, we saw ghosts. a 100+ year old house, someone had started a fire in the basement and luckily it didn't blow up the gas boiler, reservoir or the connections to the street which could have led to city wide destruction. The douche bag who did that later reported feelings of dread and fear whenever the idiot came near the house.   My family never felt fear towards the ghosts. Some hauntings are undoubtedly protective spirits. Like that one medium said to Sam and Colby, your departed loved ones are around you, watching out for you. Sometimes I do feel their presence and that was long before watching that video.
Sam is definitely in his villain era rn and I support that fully! 😈🖤
COLLAB WITH THE STURNIOLOS
Nah Dave the guide was like Sup bros when he walked towards them XDXDXD
56:25 You guys gotta go on a long ghost hunt with The Boys!
im your 33.520 liker
After like 2 weeks u finally post a video I thought u guys were like yk arrested 😅
YOU SHOULD COLAB WITH ALBERT FLAMINGO
Sam and Colby are the best YouTube channel in the world that are my favourite video of  watching it and have a great day Sam and Colby ❤😊
HOME STATE REPRESENT LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
I think we need to notice that it has been scientifically proven that the flashlights turn on and off depending on the temperature. Otherwise, this was a great video. Keep up the great work!
They look so genuinely happy in this video omg 🥹
You guys are so inspiring to me and my best friend that me and her started our own paranormal channel but we don't really know how to start but you guys are awesome love you guys sm ✖️👻👹🖤
its so cool to see these guys change peoples minds/perspectives on spirits, the paranormal and what happens in the afterlife and stuff
Am I the only one that thinks  the guide looks like Chris watts
I almost got a friking heart attack, when they put the photo of William in the begining. My dad was sitting next to me in the living room and started to whistle and he yawned it sounded like a demon came out of his body
Bro can u guys plz do like a thing for sum one to come investigate with y'all I'll pay so much money forrr thtttt
Im right next to there!
I heard that the Appalachian Mountains are really haunted so maybe that would be a great place to investigate. I don’t live in the area but hearing from other people, they agree it’s really haunted. You have probably been tagged in those types of videos on TT so maybe that will convince you to explore this area
I was literally looking through Sam&colbys videos to find one I haven’t watched
The whole time Leslie and Rae  were freaking out while sam and Colby were so calm and not scared that shows what you guys have experienced throughout the past years in the paranormal world. And the girls did a great job for their first time Sam and Colby you are amazing people and ghost hunters. Happy New year can wait to continue watching your videos in 2024❤
Such a fun watch! Now time to watch Rae's BTS vlog she just posted of this!
Y'all need too pring the sturnliolo tripLets
I love this video it was crazy can't wait for more to come

When I find out, Sam Colby are literally two hours away from me I was literally crying
At 41:21 Sam said that there was all 5 phones nxt to the lights, but there is only 4 people there...
POV: Their last post of 2023- You guys had such a successful year, and made people feel so happy! You’ve survived a week at the conjuring, Colby beat Cancer and Sam recovered from his back. ( if you don’t know he jumped off the roof of trap house ) You guys are AMAZING and AWESOME! ❤️
16:01 there is a shadow that goes behind the window
I think you guys should start doing your old going to abandon places again with Kris and Celina or just go do something with Kris and Celina I love those vids ❤️❤️

Heyyy loved the video❤ there is a great Belgian youtouber Silent Jill that also do gosh hunting, you guys should collab with her 🫶🏼
Hi Sam and colby! So i was thinking if you would like to come back to the uk for these collabs i think you should do tubbo and james marriott for one of the videos and maybe ranboo and philza for another!!! I think it would be so entertaining and also ranboo said he does beleuve that there is something in the after life so j thought it would be a good collaboration with them!
Been wondering if you could do a collaboration with The Boys soon! They've done a couple videos of ghost exploring, and it's really good. I highly recommend on checking out their channel and doing a collab!
I have been a fan for about 3 halloweens ago (2021)
Oh, this is like an hour from us!!!! Love your videos. My son and I finish our days with your videos.
I Literally can’t wait for 2024 this is going to be awesome ,watching the videos they’ve done recently you know there going big when it come to ghost hunting.       See you next year Sam and Colby

Yipee
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  really great vid holyy, it was awesome!! :D
Hiii
Can’t wait until the first post in 2024
I once had a moment while walking along a street which didn't have sidewalks, I didn't consciously hear anything or see anything but something told me to bounce to the side, so I did it... at around 90 mph a car zips right through where I had been walking. Now the sceptic response is that I unconsciously heard something but this kind of thing and more happen to me regularly. Maybe I predicted it or a ghost told me to watch out.
As a Lesler i’ve come to see her scream 🤗
Bring beckbrojack
Sam and colby you should get   special edd. To come on a investigation
Leslie and Rae doing shots with the ghosts. Who knew?

This year has been literally so crazy. At first when i didnt watch your videos or knew who you were i was really skeptical of the paranormal but now after just 11 months of watching your videos i 100% belive in the paranormal, ive even had my own paranormal experiences, some were recent and some were when i was a kid.  Also Ever since i saw one of your videos i became so much happier. I used to struggle with mental health alot but when i found out about your channel i got so much happier. Im still a bit in the middle with my mental health but now that i know who you guys are im so much happier. Thank you so much❤

That was crazy
When they were at the pool they got the name Michal and later they said that that was rumored to be the name of the dark entity so maybe they were talking to him in the pool
I have a theory about estes method that I'm scared to say or write outloud... But at one point colby said 'revenge' and then soon there was 'God' and they said they were 'cursed' I don't want to fully voice the theory, because it's awful. But what if neither of them were good and he left them here to fight out their differences and they're angry because of it and want revenge? I know her husband was abusive, but maybe she did some bad things? Like I said, I don't like this theory, but I feel like there might be some truth in it. I'll be honest, I cried when that theory first came to mind, because it's awful and disrespectful to even think in that way... but idk. It kind of, somehow makes sense to me...  I would like to know what you guys think?
Thanks for an amazing year with all the videos u have made I think u should do a video with the boyz next year they have been wanting to do a video with y’all
Bruh I swear there was a shadow right behind the girl sitting down when they said the husband's name
This was a cool video o don’t think I would be wble to do the hosting game not be able to look behind you ahhh
Hey you guys can't 😢 to see this
yall should take @debsmikle and @MARTINBABEH that would be a hilarious group, love your videos i went from a non believer to wanting to go to haunted places myself
You should take the sturniolo triplets i have been waiting for you guys to colab
I love your videos so much they always make my day I’m so proud of you guys love y’all ❤
Sam and Colby are literally like therapists. They post a video and everyone goes wild. They are my favorite people ever to investigate haunted places
It would be SO SICK if you took Jacksepticeye and Ethan Nestor on one of these!
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR FOREVERRRRR
This might seem crazy but last night i saw a woman that was black in a accident  in my room and a man there
amazing video!!
Like if you came from Rae’s vid!!
That (casual flex) killed me 😂
omg 1 hour! i love yall so much i watch your videos everyday!! please notice mee 💕💕💕💕
Please give them permission to watch the video when they stream, i really really wanna see their reactions
Thank you for an amazing year boys. Would have come 0% further with my life without yall, thank you. Happy new years..
Bro u could see rea was scared sh*tless😂😂😂
Go to a haunted place in New York With kall  me, khris and celena spooky  boo
I literally love you guys I have been watching you guys since day one I have always been into paranormal things and I just am so proud keep up the good work❤
This is such an amazing collaboration!!
THIS MADE MY BIRTHDAY WAY BETTER
1:47 WHY DID COLBY DO THATTT LMFAOO
i would love to see Masayoshi, or Michael reeves!
You guys literally have to make an overnight haunted video with The Boys, it would be #1 in ours
IM SO HAPPY YOU GUYS POSTED AGAIN I WAS WAITING IMPATIENTLY 🎉🎉🎉
I got the bunny Xplr merch for Xmas and im so happy , These boys have saved my life fr I'm so proud of them x
Can u explore in 2024 a church or a school haunted with the other Persons that can talk to the spirt?
WOOOO
This was such a cool video and Rae and Leslie did a really good job ❤
Flashback to when Sam did the hosting ritual by himself in the Trap House?
You guys should invite the Sturniolo Triplets
Again, I’m shocked you guys always release the world best content ever, with the best content creators! I can’t wait for 2024 so excited to see what you guys do next🩷
Fun fact about labotamys is thta they actual work very well but back then they would pull ranbom people off the streets to do the producdure, alao they didnt clean or do it properly they just hit pull and call the next person. This led to infections, disabilitys and ect. So if you really want to make a zombie with no memorys with basic humans functions then leran and practice how to do a proper lubotamy.
fantastic video!! i think yall really need to try and get markiplier to do a video, it would be so funny
46:30 They recorded it on november so we waited 1 month for this video
Hey Sam and Colby you guys should visit the rolling hills asylum in Bethany NY it’s pretty haunted by this ghost named Roy
Why is every ghost name is Mary and Michael?
Who else knows the hosting game from Sam’s personal channel like 4 years ago
I love you guys videos I subscribed to keep up and to support  you guys too
Happy New Year boys, thank you for showing us that the after life is real and thank you for showing us these amazing evidences. 🖤👻 I want a video with twin paranormal, they are like you guys and i think it'll be fun. Can't wait to watch you videos in 2024! 🥰🤩
You guys should go to for Knox’s in Maine!! I live in Maine and would love to have you come here! If you do make sure to try the lobster 🦞 😋
Ray ray and Leslie, the dynamic duo
I love this
We need to get Markapiler on this channel!
loved this one so much, fuslie and rae were hilarious, the reactions were top tier. looking forward to 2024 <3
10:43 🚪👤👀👹
It is a very important day because Sam and Colby posted
Sam and Colby are the best ghost hunters in my opinion. No one can beat them to me.
AINT NO WAY Y'ALL WENT WHERE I USED TO LIVE ;-; ( I knew Alton was haunted but not that haunted Jesus )
Everytime I look at the views they go up 💀✌️
I live a couple of towns over from Alton ik exactly were u guys went. I also go to Alton all the time. Also because of u guys I want to start gost hunting and filming.❤
I would love to be In a video but I live in Thomasville, GA. Far I know
Sam and Colby you guys are literally the best paranormal investigators in my opinion I think you guys should come back to Alton Illinois because there are many more buildings that are haunted in this area when I saw you guys upload this video I literally cried because I’m 15 minutes away from where you guys were and I been watching u guys for more than a couple of years but definitely think you guys should come back 😁
I loved this so much, they were both so nice! It feels good to have you guys back. Love ya!
Cash and Kate baker and maverick would be so funny tho Kate would be crying mabey not harper tho she would probs be so scared 😂😅
you should go with the boys
Im not a big ghost hunting fan but i like Rae and leslie so i watched this video and it was a lot of fun!
This is gonna be an unpopular opinion but I would love to see you guys do a video with one of the gun YouTubers. Like I love the idea of one of those big ex-military guys going ghost hunting with y'all... Anyways... thanks for the decompression video after another hard day of baking cookies 😅❤
Sam and colby you should take the Eddievr or sleeping mully to a haunted place !
I usually don't use YouTube but when I see notifications for sam and Colby... switch apps as fast as possible to watch them
At 23:04 behind Sam in the window it looks like someone looking at them from the window
The part when they photoclshopped the two girls going out the door and into the other got me laughing so hard
One of the goat YouTubers
Has anyone else noticed that only Sam in all the videos is the only one to say “Hello?” When they hear something?
@joeygraceffa
This is the most curious video about ever seen
Love it how they posted this 1 hour ago and it already has 32K likes, deserved 😎
39:03 Colby's little waddle 😂
This year was amazing thank you for your videos love you💗

WE NEED TO GET SAM AND COLBY TO PLAY PHASMOPHOBIA ITLL ACTUALLY BE HILARIOUS MOST LIKELY😂
YOU DONT KNOW HOW MUCH I CHECKED TO SEE IF YALL POSTED YET😭

Holy sh** what a way to end 2023. Thanks I love you Sam and Colby that was the best video ever ❤

Michael is the name of an archangel. If it’s him who is there guarding the place or the guide, someone powerful put him there.

I need to see a collab between Jeffery star and Sam and Colby at the QUEEN MARY
Definitely take the tripletssss
OMFG I LOVE YOU GUYSSSS YALL ARE SO GOOD at this stuff
You need to be careful on your next adventure the shadows that Kris usually sees often follow you and the shadows that follow you often want to hurt you the crash you heard before was one of the men who had died after doing a ritual Be careful
16:01 look at the window to the right of Fuslie (our right)
PLEASE SEE THIS. when y’all were doing the party experiment, there was a clip on the night vision camera and Colby was turned around, looking over his shoulder turned sideways. I noticed and decided to let y’all know.

WE NEED DANTDM TO GO TO ONE OF THESE
Hey Sam and Colby just a quick idea for you… Saw it on “The Boys” overnight in a haunted lighthouse video where when doing the Estes method they put a mic into the headphones to allow the audience to hear what the spirit box is saying Thanks for all the amazing videos you guys put out on YouTube and I love yall ❤
please go investigate the appalachion mountains 💀☠👻☠💀☻
leslie and lou my fav love story 😂
The lightchain is going off underneath Rae because someone put his phone directly on top of the chair...... you guys cant be serious. Y'all trippin hard af and dont realize you guys are making the light go off.... so cringe. Also you guys cant even light a match LOL both of you doing it wrong, there is a technique to it and none of you knew that, if you do it wrong then it breaks.. and thats what happened.. holding it wrong...omg
BAYLEN LEVINE OR THE STURNIOLOS OFC
Interesting video! I have a thought tho, a guide had told that he saw a light/orb, and he was thinking it was an angel, so what if the name "Michael" that you got on ovilus, was a name of that "angel". An Archangel Michael maybe? Just my thought, please don't attack me.
Y’all should take the Sturniolo triplets on a scary adventure
Colby moved his head a lot during the host thing. Might’ve pissed off some spirits.
It'll be cool if you collab with disguised toast, Lily pichu and Michael reeves
I would love to see you guys collab with Twin Paranormal! :D❤
Funneh fans 👇

51:58 makes me laugh so hard for some reason
YEAHHH SAM AND COLBY POSTEDDD!
The girls made the video to unserious , I like when it’s just Sam and Colby in the video it’s more interesting
I’m sorry but how tf do these girls first of all, not know who John Wayne Gacy is? & two, know about medieval torture devices, but not know what a lobotomy is?? Are they not from America or  am I just missing something?
My aunt lives in Illinois
LIVE LAUGH LOVE SAM AND COLBY! IVE BEEN A FAN FOR OVER 8 YEARS!!!! COLBY BROCK YOUR SO COOL AND SAM GOLBACH YOUR ALSO VERY COOL AND UH IDK WHAT IM SAYING!!!-
Isn’t this poor kid sick 😷 😢 how are you seriously?!? How you feeling?
my days instantly better when sam and colby post
YAYYYYY BROO LOVE YOU VIDSSSS
John Wayne Gacey dressed as a clown and entertained kids at birthday parties. He did not kill or lure small children.  Nor did he kill while dressed as a clown.  He did, however, lure teenage boys to his house with the promise of construction work with under the table pay. He would then drug them, SA them and kill them. He did bury them under his house, in some of the walls and backyard. I think his range was 15/16 yrs old to about 22; with the slightly older teens being a large amount of his victims. He also tried to go after runaways and un-housed boys.   I think about 12 out of his 20 victims have not been identified; not 100% on those numbers.   But he did not go after young children.
Yessssssss a new sam and colby video yessssssssss
PLEASE COLLABORATE WITH KRIS AND CELINA AGAIN! YALL TOGETHER ARE UNSTOPPABLE!!!

Ive been to alton for like a week because my moms ex bf family lived there. it was like a two hour drive from where I live and the two hours coming back from there was honestly the worst ive ever felt. like i was sick the entire week but just driving back i felt worse.
Sam and Colby are my favorite YouTubers and when I lost one of my friends to a fight I watch them to make me feel better and make me laugh!❤
Are we not gonna talk about at 37:57 there's a pair of eyes in the doorway thats like pitch black, not the one with the steps. As soon as i saw that ny soul jumoed out of my body💀

Happy new year
Surprised I’m this early
2023 was amazing! while you guys had your bad moments you keep dong amazing things. Thank you so much for your work <33 also Happy (early) Birthday to Colby!
Um why is no one talking about how they got SPONSORED by UNIVERSAL PICTURES like WHAT
I think maybe the reason why the ritual didnt really work is because Colby looked behind him a few times when they were in the pool??
Yay! More haunted! Can't wait to see what you guys have planned for next year! 💖💖💖💖💖💖
Your body is more accessible to spirits when your drinking because your own spirit leaves when intoxicated
I think this is the calmest into you’ve ever done lol 😂😂
I just wanna say I love both of you and I can't wait to see what 2024 brings and u have truly made my life better and I am forever grateful for that you have saved me in more ways than u could ever know and I just want to say thank you ❤❤

Hi I love u guys so much and will u ever come to Scotland one day?
44 mins ago???
Salm and coby
Live laugh love Sam and colby
Not that far into the video yet, but what if the reason this whole town is so haunted is BECAUSE of the water? Maybe the people who drank it or simply lived near it, touched it, whatever, most likely drinking it before death, is the reason they're trapped? Same with other entities in other places. I'm not fully sure about this because uhm, I'm not an investigator, but just a little thing I thought about :D Edit: With the rock too, I think these are a BIGGG thing, considering how these rocks are believed to keep like feelings or trauma or whatever, (what I heard in the video lmk if I'm wrong), all the negative feeling probably drew them back here.
Did anyone saw eyes to right in 37:55 ?
omg in 2024 you guys should go to tower of London!!
AGGHH AT 41:45 DOSENT COLBY TURN AROUND WHEN HE WASNT MEANT TI LOOK BEHUND HIM

When I heard you guys talking about the ritual of the hosting game. I've never been more scared in my life. It's been years since I heard about that game. Like I was like a little kid when I heard about that game and played it.

This comment has so many likes for no reason
Thank God for Will Neffs Birthday party 33:12
Ok so theory Lookin back ok one of the vids from 4 years ago , of specifically Sam buying haunted objects, there was a doll named “Miss Sally Bearly” could this be what’s been haunting Sam all this time , because the mediums had said it was before the conjuring house , so it’s just a suspicion it might be that who has haunted Sam all this time …. Just a theory tho
January 5 on my birthday 😂😂😂
love u guys
sam and colby are the only thing keeping me alive lmaooo
Love you guys so much. Thank you for everything you have done
PLEASE
DO A COLLAB WITH THE BOYS
come to oklahoma
U guys should go to a haunted place...BUT drunk!
Sam and colby are like ( ghost tell us your secrets and very thing about you ) the ghosts bs like ( hell no but only if you get the f out of my town)
Is that Sam and Colby's girlfriends ????😮😮😮😮
This was amazing
i love how sam and colby have happy moments whenever bad things happen, it just makes me laugh 😂
Early 🎉🎉🎉 I love u guys so much
2 minutes after your guys posted this video i started watching it
Sam timber when you said you will not play these 3am games
I love to see all of my favorite people together 🎆
Day 1 of asking you guys to take Princess Alex and Lyssynoel on an ghost investigation
I wish you happy new year and colby Happy Birthday, love you Guys, make me more videos, please. I loved the video so please make more videos. I would love to see them.❤❤😊😊
Thank you guys for everything
These girls are so cute! And have great energy
Thank god this video wasn't with Poki otherwise should would have asked you to buy her cookies
Have you contacted Twin Paranormal and collaborated with them at a s- walker cursed place.
Sam and colby 🔛🔝
Hope you guys had a good Christmas with your family's  can't wait for this year coming up for the craziest videos and happy almost birthday Colby 🎉
Colby calling then "the girls" made me realize that there are two ways that men refer to women as "girls" one has derogatory and sexist undertones like women are to stupid to be called women and another is a loving, caring and protective way like "i gotta protect my girl" and Sam and Colby are 1000000% in the protective and caring category. You two are awesome influencers and even better men! Keep up the good work ! ❤
SO COOL YALL CAME TO MY HOME TOWN!❤
Did anyone else see that at 28:02 Colby put his arm around Fulslie!??
Yess get it guys❤❤
38 mins ago, I love watching you 😂😂
Love you Sam and Colby y’all amazing ghosts hunters 😊😊😊
@samandcolby do a video with Hasan he’s cool with valkery
Amazing collaboration 💯🔥🔥
So close to my hometown, this is wilddddd
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW YOU POST
Lack of vocabulary makes you say "like"
Is he William afton
Thank you for the all nighter to edit the video ❤❤
IT WAS AWESOME HANGING OUT WITH BOTH OF YOU! THANK YOU FOR THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE!

AHHHHHHHH FINALLY!!! 😻😻😻
You guys should visit Indiana. We have loads of scary haunted places!
I love sam and colby everytime i watch them it males my day so much better❤

Can we appreciate the fact that their video is scary enough but then they add the extra random scary transition clips
Here before 100k veiws🎉
I’ve been waiting for this
Okay this is so random but the guide looks like William afton 😭
Ugh so disappointed you guys still use the flashlights. They've been debunked so many times and you don't even explain to your viewers that they go on and off on their own randomly. Transparency is where it's at, total respect for the ghost hunters who fully explain this stuff.
Hi
y'all remembers sam's 3am challenges? he did the hosting game in the past bro
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!
Thx Sam and Colby for helping me this year from all the things that have happened to me this year I love you all from helping me

I'd love to see Michael Reeves from OTV in one of these, maybe he could even engineer some type of ghost detecting device himself

So excited that y’all came and investigated Mineral Springs! The building is my favorite place in Alton and I’m so glad you guys are giving it some love and recognition. Sad that I didn’t catch y’all in town, but I hope you enjoyed your experience!!🤍
hey guys. hope you had a great holiday! i know your busy but there is this really cool and old place on long island new york. it’s called old bethpage village restoration. i don’t know 100% if its haunted or not but its still a really cool place if it is. i do have a photo of like an orb but i’m not sure if its camera glare or not. thank you and have a happy new year!
AHHHH Yes you guys finally went to Alton! I live the next town over and have been waiting for this day forever!!!! Its such a spooky place :)
I love how they randomly say "that's not funny 😐"
Thank you so much for making these videos. I know how much effort goes into scheduling, filming, and even editing. I think you guys should visit Bodie Ghost Town, which is supposed to be haunted. So thank you. Stay safe and keep up the good work. Love you ❤️
I’m like 10 minutes away from Alton. I’m gonna cry. I want to meet them so bad.
The fact they spent all night editing this ❤
I was just watching Sam and Colby videos (the conjuring week) and they just post a new one!!!!!!!!!
If you aren't subscribed to sam and colby, then you are going to be possessed

Sam and Colby have taught me one thing be scared of bugs, not ghosts.
Sam and Colby you guys should go to new York to haunted hills asylum and I want to go with tho

This use to be one of my most fav channels. and didnt miss a video. but lately they have become so childish and seem to just want to play and try to impress the girls with them  i can't watch them any longer. they went from adults to kids playing. 2 ten year olds could do what they do now. and act more adult about it.

My family is actually from Alton, my great grandma owned a bar and hair salon, but recently had to sell it. That place always felt very comforting for some odd reason. There are so many stories of hauntings and things of that nature. The upstairs portion of the old bar was filled with items that had been up there since the place was built. definetly very haunted.  It's nice to see yall visiting somewhere that im familiar with. Loved the video!
YOU KNOW ITS A GOOD DAY WHEN THE BOYS POST WOOOOOOO!! (watching in my xplr hoodie)
I feel like you guys put yourself in dangerous places and situations but always end up entertaining me and making me smile! Yall are the best!🫶🏻  *ALSO I GOT XPLR MERCH FROM ZUMEI'S TODAY AT THE MALL!!!🫶🏻❤

I dare you guys go back to the Conjuring house and stay there for a MONTH
I’ve never been this early before ❤
At 7:08 colby belike: '' have you guys seen thé backrooms before?🧐'' he sounds so funny saying it 😂😂
I think I’m on time😻🙏🏼
Nice
Hiiii
i can’t believe that they went here!!!! this is crazy
that you had Rae and Leslie with you for this, awesome! and you should have invited that other couple you met at the conjuring house that can talk to spirits by holding hands, so Rae and Leslie could witness that, too!  and if you know of any haunting stories in Houston, Texas and want to investigate, would you let me know? I live in Houston (don't know of any such stories myself) and I'd love to hang out with you guys.
im going to the queen Mary from the 7th - 8th. wish me luck. (or meet me there, idc)

WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT THEY ARE IN ILLINOIS
It's literally illegal to be this early
my hometown! alton is haunted af
BRO IM ESRLY
I have never seen a channel get sponsored by universal before
Sam and Colby you guys have really changed my view as a Muslim I already believed in the paranormal and that their are ghost,spirts,demons,angles and good and bad spirits but most important (to me at least) God. Though one thing I couldn’t believe was communicating/ communication to the afterlife world. Through your investigations I really truly believe and appreciate you spreading that there is most definitely things out there we don’t know of. Even though I’m still a bit of a skeptic (only a tiny bit  bc I have had a few experience and your videos really proved to me)with spirit communication. I love you guys for doing this thank you. I have been a fan for couple on moths since your week at the conjuring, and that really pushed me into watching more of your videos I Binge watch you guys  every time I get. Thank you again.
They put so much effort in their videos and that's amazing
OMG ON MY B-DAY TOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

People who came from tik tok
Sam and Colby, you guy's really need to do research on Dolores Cannon and Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique. I really think you both should have a session with a level 3 practitioner. Ya'll can benefit tremendously. It's an extremely spiritual, deep, process and it would be interesting to know what your guy's experiences are especially Colby as he's HUGE empath❤
I watch you all the time AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕😘😘😘😘😘
Love you guys such an amazing video❤❤ also thank you for spending your time editing videos for us ur amazing❤
Heye
7 foot figure named William 😂😂
Sam and Colby have taught me one thing. Be terrified of bugs, not ghosts. (for me its litteraly opposite😂)

i am so upset i missed sam and colby in MY TOWN and they went to the one place I would always go too 🤦‍♀️
My parents would see an apparition just before anyone got injured or if there was an accident involving injury (the spirit was thought to be a doctor in his lifetime), and one day my mother saw him and in the next hour she was rushed to the hospital to have an emergency C-section and I was born blue due to not breathing and with a heart condition (SVT).
SAM QND COLBY I LOVE YOU I HAVE BIN WATCHING YOU SINCE FOREVER AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH LOVE YOU 💕

“I’m not a spider killer” *unsub*
I really do love your guys content and how much you put into these videos but I think you could capture more of there weren’t so many guest, I love when you guys go solo and find out more about the place the backstory and history of the place, I jus think more would come out of it without having guests who play around and make games out of everything
LETS GO NEW VID!!
I’m in Long Beach for my birthday getting a coffee and I’m watching u guys and I love y’all sm you guys are the reason im alive

All the hard work you both put into the video’s for us, what we’ve all learned this year all the mind blowing video’s damn and even tho there were a few downs this year you both never gave up and kept going no matter what, you 2 are so strong! I’m glad that I’m being a part of this amazing and kind family, we are literally the best! Can’t wait to see what’s 2024 is going to bring. All the best wishes and sending many love!  Thanks for making my life a lot more funnier and for being a safe space to me every single day where I love going to. Y’all literally saved me and I can’t be more grateful for this.  Lots of love ❤️
