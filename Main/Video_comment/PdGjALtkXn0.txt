7:30 What's the title of the song that's playing in the arena?
i don't think i've EVER been in a louder rink. i'm not even from halifax but i've been to so many huge events at the scotiabank centre: mooseheads hosting the memorial cup, mooseheads in the qmjhl final, crosby's homecoming in 2023... heck, i think this was even louder than the golden goal. my ears were buzzing all night into the next day. (i'd also like to thank connor bedard for scoring this ot beauty because it gave me the sense to record the gold medal game overtime, now i have my pov and reaction to guenther's goal to cherish forever ❤🤍)
Congratulations Canada 🇨🇦 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Go Canada there the best team in the tournament
Watching this at 98%
Bedard made them pay for the dirt with that overtime goal.
As a Slovak, I gotta say that even after 2 years I revisit this just because of how iconic that squad was, not the mention the game overall. I enjoyed every single bit of it,therefore, I come back to this just to never forget yk. Each year from then have been worse for our squad. So every person who sees this comment if any, dont forget to be thankful for what you have in that moment. God has its own way of making, so be sure it will be made how it should be. Goodnight
I live in canada but I’m currently in the USA
A year later and the Halifax crowd had to be one of the loudest crowds ever

Connor bedard is best
Good job Canada!!!
7:55 the way Connor Bernard got jumped for no reason😭
God’s power❤️❤️❤️ 👇
this game was so much better than the final
WE COMING FOR YOU THIS YEAR CANADA. NO BEDARD NO WIN.
Awesome kid
OH CANADA!!!!!!!
nah after the way the slovakians treated bedard in this game, the final goal was the biggest f u and the most deserved goal I've ever seen. well done man
easy
canada was lucky that game
nICE MATCH
Holy Canada chill out😮😮
Fuck the Rapehawks
Lets go petty theft and home invade jorge...
0:21
That game winning goal is amazing
Ive never been a hockey fan, i dont know how i stumble to him and now I will wait for the NHL season to start to watch him play, he is the kind of player that will attract new audience to the sport I believe.
A lot of Blackhawks here
Fun Fact. Bedard and Gajan both drafted by Chicago BlackHawks.
Update: bedard and gajan (Slovak goalie) are both Blackhawks now🤣
THE BEST GAME EVER
Bedard is 🔥🔥🔥
I love ❤ Bedard he's the best!
Is it allowed for a player to bring his glove behind the Golie line and punch out the puck?
What a phenomenal game of Slovakia! We are used to Canada playing out of this world games, but here one could feel this great spirit of hockey sport in both teams. Slovakia came so close to beat the champions... but this last winning  attack was just insane!
Too be honest with u Canada has a top of the line team like there a powerhouse is world hockey  Slovakia is starting to become a powerhouse too
I'm not a hockey expert but can we all agree that canadas defense is horrible that their offence makes up for it, also that one bad play bedard made by sliding on the ice full belly was horrible decision making
0:21 and 9:14 is my favourite part.
Idk if anyone’s gonna see this cuz it’s 5 months after, but holy crap what a game. This was essentially Slovakia’s u19 team as well, only 4 players can’t return to next year’s team. If they had Slafkovsky I doubt they would have lost this game. That being said what a winner from the future Blackhawks legend
Where can i watch the full game?
Someone call Ray Ferraro and offer him the bag. Mike Johnson is fucking awful at calling games, poor Gord
0:33 Latvian and Austrian flags? IIHF smoked???
That’s it bedze
This was a close game because Slovakia’s goalie did a great job, otherwise they would have been toast. I see some people say that Canada got a favorable call going into the overtime is so wrong. The Slovaks got away with a lot of non cross-checking calls against Canada. They played dirty. Connor Bedard deserved all the credit and accolades in this game and tournament. I look forward to watching him in the NHL. I hope he ends up playing on a Canada team where fans will give him a proper respect. It’s BS that Bedard got a penalty. The last goal was spectacular!
Fück Canada, Slovakia should’ve won.
That's it bedsy
This game was absolutely incredible. Go Canada!
Where the Canadians comes from.
Go Canada Go!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🇨🇦👍
🇨🇦👍
It was so funny people were all upset at Bedard for taking a chance/risk to score the Michigan. Did he not take a chance/risk on the overtime goal too? He's praised for one but not the other.
Funny how Canada won game vérifiée someone was doing a shit celebration like Slovakia the kid that sent a kiss to the crow was fun to watch crying like a bitch
Had the blessing of watching this goalie play IRL, made a lot of saves that I thought he had no chance on. Special goalie with a good career ahead of him.
I think we can say for awhile now...that Slovakia is no longer a "guaranteed win to the semis" anymore.
This game was by far the best game in the tournament. When I was watching it I was feeling sick I was so worried for Canada. But then BEDARD comes in STRONG. He couldn't score with a shot so he took on all 3 players and puts it in. This game and the gold medal game were amazing. But by far this game was insane.
The best game of the tournament.
The save before the goal was better. 👏
9:39 Camera man rushing towards the Slovak goalie LMFAO
Another ''nemec'' from chekoslovakien makin' 3:3... Lmaooo
Nice
Awesome!! 🤙🏻
Canadians never ask Fortune for more than she can give!!
Россия где 📍❓
Po dnešním výsledku finále je celkem škoda, že to nakonec té Kanadě vyšlo. Ale měli zase namále jako v tomhle zápasu. Jooj, kdyby jste je vyřadili, věřím, že česko a slovensko by se spolu umístilo doost vysoko. Ale jejich podpora na místním stadionu byla obrovská, čili potlesk jak klukům z českýho tak slovenskýho týmu, že je to nezlomilo!
Yes 🍁 woo-hoo I love you team 🍁
Slovak, as a Canadian, damn good hockey guys
Conner bedard the 🐐
4 guys including the goalie tried to poke the puck away. Probably the craziest thing I've ever seen in Hockey.
what is up with the crosscheck.
hockey without Russia is like football without Brazil
I knew this was to happen
Самый классный матч!
Krása chlapci. Klobúk dole. Hope our Czech brothers can avenge us. Good luck to all remaining teams.
Brilliant match! One of the best! Greetings from Slovakia
You can tell they sent out on a mission to get in connors head and it worked
RIP Eli Palfreyman. Has anyone considered what his family is going through? When will people start speaking up as the evil continues?
Beautiful hockey, even after the defeat by the Canadian, I'm already looking forward to the Czechs when they will pay it back
NICE HIT 😂
Chlapci dobre ste hrali !!! Misko Blanar len tak dalej :) zdravime z Vancouver :)
WAS THERE ANY DOUBT!?!
A 17yr old one man show
Good grief, that was incredibly close. Well played, Team Slovakia. Go Canada! :)
Очень приличная команда у Словакии, чуть не повезло, молодцы парни, желаю всем играть в nhl!!
Just like the 2022 final. Canada up by two but gets dragged to OT, then Canada has to make a spectacular save before clinching the win. Amazing
Seeing they were loosing, the Slovaks then resorted to playing rough, sore loosers. CANADA prevailed. 3 times hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.
After Canada, I cheer for Slovakia. The fight and spirit you guys have, is something to behold. A+ game Slovakia, A+.
TSN sucks
Heyy baby I wanna know if you'd be my girl is new 21st century manana hey hey hey goodbye song Canada to USA
As a Canadian, I'm happy our guys won, but DAMN Slovakia brought their game!  I have to raise a beer to those young guys for how skilled and tough they are!
As a Finn this frustrate me more than SWE-FIN game. hats off to Slovakia!
🇸🇰🇸🇰🇸🇰🇸🇰🇸🇰
Bros playing chel on rookie
Canada isn’t going to win gold with this team. They got the star but they are lacking the grit. When Canada dominated the WJ we had a good balance of skill and toughness. Guys like Tutu were so important to the team. This group just doesn’t have the physical dominance Canada was known for.
Bedard, wow
He is him
netch just deadly
Great game, and a great win, the game could of went either way.  What an  outstanding goal. Lots of heart in that game on both sides
Just watched the Sweden vs fucking czech game, sure am a swede but the ref can suck ass a bigg juicy czhech ass. Hand up to swedes face and he started bleeding (NOTHING) Tripping in overtime should have been a penelty or penelty shot (NOTHING) goalie doing a soccer move trying to fake being run over when he went into the sweden (NOTHING) The canadian, usa refs must have gotten a real good blow job by czechs to play in this game god damn that is so ugly. This win was not deserved for the czechs far from even. If u watched the damn game u should have seen this stuff and don't talk against it and if u do then rewatch the damn game and use ur 2 goddamn eyes, if ur eyes only work for czechs side then call ur parent or kids and let them use their eyes to for fuck sake.
Go Canada 🇨🇦  World Junior go go go let's win this game  .
Go Canada Go
Canucks fans 🤤🤤🤤
wow slovakian team was so close to win this, pity one miracle boi made canada win  like in b class movies , nevertheless team Canada and #16 is almost certain champion, ugh
Man that camera dude in the Slovakian players at the end is ruthless; just right up in players who are devastated.
Slovakia what a dirty hockey team
One hell of a game
all-time goal with all-time celly
San Jose Sharks please get that kid on your team.. If Ducks get him it's over
Good game by the Slovaks, they had their chances and they were tough on the puck & tough after the play.
Wow he is wonderful. So smooth
Almost like football
Let’s go canada
Mama there goes that man 😅😮😮
What a GREAT show Canada and Slovakia put on 👍true North strong baby 💪
GO CANADA GO BACK TO BACK CHAMPIONS
👍👍👍👍
Жаль Словакию,Канадские девочки победили.
Матч словаков. Жаль что несправедливость существует
This team has A LOT of preparation to do if we’re gonna beat the US. Having one player score half your goals against fucking Slovakia is NOT how we’re gonna win this tournament.  DO BETTER
Great game. Honestly i didn't expect that we can be so near to win. But our Team didn't give up even it was 2:0, or 3:1. What a pitty the last attack of Bedart. 😒 Thank you guys and congratulation to Cadana.
Slovakians need to be proud of their performance. Slowly but surely you are going to be as good as you were in the era of Hossa, Demitra, Gaborik etc.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Slovakia 👏👏👏
Slovaks acting like Russians
Instant classic
Эти 2 команды должны были играть в финале.
What an awesome game! Slovakia you played great hockey. Thank you for coming to Canada. 😎😎😀😀🙌🙌
this was actually a crazy game, both teams playing exceptionally, all the crazy moments from both teams. Slovakia played absolutely amazing, especially their goalie, huge respect to all those players and i hope they have great hockey careers. Bedard, man, that was just they most unreal thing i've ever seen.
👌👌👍🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦👌
To bylo skvělé!
Beďar, pupínek klička a gól. Jaaj
F*** canada
I can't believe Canada got so close to losing actually Good job Slovakia and good luck Canada  I also can't wait to see Bedard in the NHL
And god did grant to Canada, indestructible hockey players...
Congrats on the win Canada! :) Great game by both teams! :)
😘🇨🇦
🇺🇸USA up next🇺🇸Let’s see baby🇺🇸
That OT winner was a beauty.
Без России это не хоккей 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
What a dirty GWG... Go Canada!
Slovakia players are just plain dirty taking a playerwith cross checks with sticks from front and back.  Unbelievable they were not penalized for intent to injure.  Add to that a deliberate hit to the head and no penalty. OMG are the officials ever giving Slovakia extreme leeway. However the Canadians proved the can defeat a team wit the officials as the oppositions extra players.
It is not world championship without Russia 🇷🇺
Bruh the goalie at the end is died
Ok like ah WOW I'm impressed here WOW dad all proud. Can you say hello retirement LOL
I don’t even watch hockey but I can appreciate how insane that last goal was
The commies win!
Canada has HORRIBLE goaltending
Came here for the goal. Wasn't disappointed.
who cares.....really
As a football fan, I never knew a hockey game could be so intense. Let's go Canada!!
GO CANADA! THE BEST!
Словаки первые кто сломал канадцев на этом мчм. Канада с большим трудом вырвала эту победу! Словаки большие молодцы!! В целом хотел отметить хорошую подготовку киперов у канадцев, словаков и латышей.
Bédard was a millionaire before he got good at Hockey just being from North Van. White privilege on display for the country to see.
Эта игра показала что Бедард похоже второй Маршанд- хороший игрок с плохой репутацией. Будет играть в Бостоне.
Please Canuck's don't win another game i want this kid!!!!!!
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌Great game!!!❤️❤️❤️
As a Canadian the Slovak team has my respect put Canada on the ropes. Just so happens we have the next great one to bail us out this game.
Where the white cameraman come from ???
this 0:20 should be the definition of goosebump on wikipedia
Fantastic game, congrats to Canada, hats off to Slovakia.  One little comment. Canadians. Please. Just because your PM is a total embarrassment you don't have to be like him! Stop talking about dirty playing when Canada hockey is the best known for being dirty ever since the international hockey became a thing... Be better than Turkeyau! Shouldn't be too hard.
This man is playing my career
slovakians unreal
the penalty at the end of the 3rd was soooo weak. cmon refs and im canadian
Lets go boys, make the cup stay right here in Canada.
Nesledujem ten hokej moc, skor len tieto highlighty a úprimne som čakal, že sme prehrali tak 4:1, ale toto som nečakal. Kanaďania sú v mojich očiach kur*y, a to už od štvrť-finále 2012. Vidieť ich fyzicky na kolenách bol požitok pre mňa. Škodej tej prehry, ale poviem aj to, že za posledné roky som nevidel hrať Slovákov takto dobre, obzvlášť nie proti Kanade. Ak toto náhodou aj číta niekto z teamu, isto nemusíte ísť domov so sklonenou hlavou. Dali ste Kanade riadne zavariť.   Však Česi im dajú na pi*u.
Want a hockey prodigy? Name your son Connor. best shot 🤣
Fun fact: Slovak coach is criticized by the media for not pulling the goalie against Switzerland. We could have won the group and play against Germany or lost and play against Czechs or Swedes. Everything better than Canada.
Good for them, playing intimidation toward Bedard, you deserve what you got soab
The guy trying to stay in play without a stick or helmet was so wild, like really, what the hell was he thinking? If Canada had lost the game because of that powerplay, honestly we would have deserved it, that was the most bizarre choice I have ever seen on ice.
Canada won because Slovakia lost, nothing more about it
Wow!  What a fantastic game! Well done  Team Slovakia, your team can hold its head high after such a great effort.  Congrats Team Canada! Connor Bedard is an incredible talent with an extremely bright future. Onward towards the Gold medal.  GO CANADA GO!!!!!
fuck all those crosschecks. pathetic.
This is what it looks like when you leave everything on the ice.  Kudos to both teams!  Bedard's goal nuts.
Omg conner Benard is so good
Did he really just do that in OT to win the game
Fitting of a Gold medal game, for entertainment value. In terms of performance, the Slovak goalie was outstanding, and if you exclude the Bedard 2nd goal for a moment, their goalie was the star of the game.  It will be difficult for the US/Canada match to surpass this game. I just hope Canada can elevate their game because the US is flying. If Canada commits the errors they made against Slovakia, they will be in deep poop.
Slovakia has lost their game themselves this time. Great performance,  though!
Russia 💪
Словаки красавцы!!!Канадцы позорники как девочки!!! Без судий не умеют играть! Полу чемпионат мира! Только Россия может составить конкуренцию!!! Канада позор!!! Почему турнир отобрали у России?! Почему проходит получемпионат мира в канаде?! Потому что КАНАДУ за уши тянут!!!))) Фуууу👎👎👎
Definitely top shelf!!!!
I had no idea Slovakia was THAT good. The entire country should be proud. Unbelievable effort, and a very talented team honestly.
I wanted Slovakia to win. I’m Canadian. We basically always win or do well. The whole crowd was us. Our team’s overfunded over advertised. We just try too hard. We definitely try the hardest. Wish Slovakia won lol
Hats off Slovakia
What a Nail Biter..What a Game..50 shots.. Wow.. Slovakia Goalie was Tremendous.. Come On Boys!   You got this ... Great Team Work!  Go Canada !!!   🇨🇦 🏒 🥉 🏆
That camera guy trying to blend in so he doesnt get hit...j/k
Amazing game! I can’t wait for the USA to win tomorrow though 😎🇺🇸
Bedard just walked in there and took the Slovaks lunch money
...югославам не хватило немного...возьмите русских в свою команду....пипец тогда будет всем северным американцам...
Sad thing that Bedard is going to Chicago. Bettman has to rebuild his team again.
Slovaks only hung in there with Canada cause the refs werent calling all their cheapshots and stuff after the whistle. only way it went to overtime...... you can argue there is now parity amongst the top 4 or so teams its time for refs to end the  "Canada treatment"....
Y'all missing Russians here
16 ый номер у Канады - это мастеровитый перец. Однако. Стиль чей? Кто так забивал? Дацук? Бурэ? Конор Мак Дэ?
Three main takeaways  1. The Slovak player laying on the puck should have been delay of game  2. The Slovak goalie put on a masterclass and was by far mvp of the game  3. Bedard is on another level
9:18 shot doesn’t go in. Connor Bernard “hold my maple syrup”
🇸🇰🇨🇿Škoda chlapci. Ale aj tak super výkon. Nemáte sa za čo hanbiť. Hlavy hore. Teraz poďme Česko, rozbite namyslenych Švédov a rozbite zamorakov. Držím veľmi palce, lebo MADE IN CECHOSLOVAKIA 🇨🇿🇸🇰
$700:000
Man, Gajan put on a goaltending CLINIC that game. Immense props to him.
I know the TSN must have burst in their pants after the win...Bedard ...Bedard ...Bedard....but wait one second Canada barely beat the "powerhouse" Slovakia?? Bedard might be the second coming for these guys which is fine but they will lose to the U.S. and the whole thing will be for not....watch and learn my friends
GG’s to the Slovakia team, they hung in there and brought it all out on the ice but in the end this is the Bedardshow…
Slovakia really played INCREDIBLE, But Bedard is just UNREAL. Wow  amazing game
Such a pity Slafkovsky wasn't part of Slovakian squad
Slovakia awesome!!!!!!!!
WHAT A GOAL TO WIN THE GAME LETS GOOOO
we might suck at soccer but hockey? its in our blood
Словакия так держать! очень за вас болел.
The Slovaks were shaking their knees before the authority of Canada.
Slovaks had the right idea trying to be a little chippy to throw the Canadians off their game, but that kid who cross checked Bedard at the end kinda sold his team out. Still what an effort
Словаки молодцы, достойно играли 💪💪💪
The Slovaks played great and came within a whisker of winning the game. They seemed to want it more. I believe Canada was looking ahead to playing the States which made the game against the Slovaks so dangerous. They will be ready for game against the U.S. or at least they should be because it is the greatest rivalry in Hockey.
Cold shivers after that game winner! 🥶
Опять Канаду судьи привезли!!!
There was some dirty cross checking but it was worth it at the end....sweet f**king goal.
И что канада без России ничто игры ничто чемпионат ничто вот и вся политика это неспорт позор западу особенно сша и канаде
As a Canadian, Slovakia has nothing to be ashamed of.   You played a great game!
Κοτόπουλα  της  Δύσης χωρίς την Ρωσία το άθλημα είναι για παιδάκια.
I would have loved to see Slafkovsky play this one and give the world a 1st overall 2022 vs 1st 2023 draft picks titans duel!
When u think Conner mcdavid was the height of this sport , than comes along this kid , NHL is bright
Connor Bedard and Shane Wright are a power duo. Even as an American they’ve got me rooting for Canada. Go Team Canada 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Dirty Slovaks tried to fold that Canada player like a lawn chair with their greasy timed cross checking assault.
@ 9:20 Connor Bedard:  Hockey-Checkers Grand Master in Action.  Is he playing hockey, or checkers?
If Montreal wasn't so selfish and let Slafkovsky play in this tournament Slovakia would have won.
Canadain here, but I genuinely feel awful for the Slovaks man. They played their hearts out in this game and seeing them get so emotional post-game was just gut-wrenching. Hold your heads up high boys, caused you played AMAZINGLY well! Its a shame someone had to lose this game cause it was one hell of a thriller from both ends!
Bedard Captain Canada 🇨🇦
Anyone else rewatching Connor Bedard single handedly weave through the defence for the hundredth time?
A wave of the middle finger to Nemec!! Bye bye.   Slovakia's goalie is an all-star.
go Slovakia go
🤩🤩  Hi, I'm Branislav from Slovakia! We only have a population of 5 million, but our young players were fantastic in this match! Congratulations to a big Canada and good luck! ✨✨
For sure one of the best world Junior games I have ever seen and I didn't even have a dog in the fight. I still will have no idea why the ref called Nemec for a Penalty with 30 seconds left, guess he wanted to try and be the hero as most refs try to be and. Anyways USA V Canada lets go
Why you stole the championship from our children?!! Are you happy now?! No!..
WOW
Чемпионат  без России ,это  кастрированный хоккей.
You stole the championship from our children! Novosibirsk, Russia😡
#21 for Slovakia is not a goalie.
Без России чемпионат теряет смысл
Massive goaltending performance by Gajan! But also what a goal, and what a tournament so far for Bedard!!! The heartbreaker celly as well, that’s 🥶
go canada go  👌👌👍👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Alle sofort sperren - sportliche Fairness sieht anders aus!
Топ-матч команды заслуживали победу, ОТ индивидуальное мастерство Канады
go Canada go !!!
How about that Halifax crowd!
Ninja camouflaged cameraman on skates visible at 9:55 getting closeups of the Slovak grief-stricken goalie and defenceman.
Connor Bedard = LEGEND Already
It is good to see these other countries getting so much better. All credit to Canada, Bedard was great but without Miller there were no opportunities to win! Now exact revenge on the chechanians. Good job slovakia.
For a Monday night, the bars & pubs in Halifax were never busier than last night !  Halifax was buzzing with energy last night !  🎉🎉✨✨🎊🎊
Go home you slovakian fucks cant slash Bedard now 🖕
ЩЩЩЩЩЩЩЩЩЩЩЩЩЩИКАPНАЯ ЗАPУБА)
Nasty ot winner unreal
What a show!
словаки чуханы, под амеров легли, щас и под канаду, проститутки одним соловом))))) терпилы и чуханы, как были так и стались
а идет ЧМ? хааа. не интересен.
ein geiles Spiel 🚀
молитесь что россия не играет !!!!!
The fact the Slovakian goalie didn’t get mvp after this game is a disgrace. He deserved it more than anyone
An epic game. Glad Canada won. If Canada play like they did tonight against the USA, it will be good night for Canada. They have to be much better and not get pushed around period! The Slovak goalie was unreal!
Канада =стадо
Dobre bratia sice tam nejste ale super zápas!
Bedard and his x-ray vision and accuracy.
Canada dominated czechoslovakia, again! Canada should get to send two teams as well.
While Slovakia played a great game, their pre-game stated purpose to disrupt Bedard failed miserably. The crosschecking after the whistle by Slovakia did not accomplish its purpose.   Connor Bedard scored Canada's fist goal, then made this a great hockey game.  The overtime goal was unbelievable.  It will be a treat to watch this young man in the days and years ahead.
Such a shame for Slovakia :(  But Bedard's goal was fucking fantastic. Very worthy of a game winning goal
Словаки красавцы!  Канада на тоненького
It is too bad this is an asterisk year if they win.
Canada played shit, only thing that was good was the Bedard´s goal. Pomstíme vás, bratia!
This Bedard guy is pretty good
Хороший матч. Жаль словаков😢
Oh the highlights were nerve wrecking!
Dare I say Slovakia threw this game?!?!?!  So much momentum until that dumb ass cross check
Without the Russian national team, this championship is not interesting
Защитник словаков неудачно выбил и ...а ситуация не напрягала чтобы так опрометчиво выбивать достаточно было её контролировать...жаль что так всё...!
Словаки молодцы, болел сердечно за вас. Жалко, что с нынешними событиями мы лишились права играть на ЧМ по хоккею 😢
Классика) в начале игры : Словакия проиграет, хотя вратарь может быть хорош, окончание игры, Словакия проиграла Канаде, хотя вратарь был хорош) прошло 30 лет, текст тот же)....
Шикарный матч! Канадцы просто выше всяких похвал. Как, впрочем, и словаки! Go Canada!
I went to the hospital to see the father of my niece and nephew he has cancer, so I did not get to see all the game but I downloaded it and Bedards ot goal was amazing one of the best Team Canada goals ever will make highlight reels for many years!  This game was awesome fast paced and back and forth  Slovakia played great but I am glad Canada won.
Another Conner micDavid
Both Slovakia and Czech Republic is on the rise it seems. Very entertaining game it at least, gave me some hope that Canada must fight for the gold not just go get it. Greetings from Sweden.
Bud, seriously...I kinda feel like Slovakia got robbed here. Forcing OT against THIS Team Canada?  And then to miss a premium scoring chance in overtime?! Dominant game-winner aside, I really think Canada got away with one.  Slovaks made a fan out of me here.  Showed some real grit!  💪
Fuck all you little twerp pussies giving any credit to the slovaks. They were dirty as fuck the entire game, im glad that cried like little bitches at the end of the game. Rot in PISS SLOVAKIA
I love how the crowd sang “In all thy sons command” instead of the woke liberal “In all of us command”.
very good goal in OT
Awesome, Bedard is now only 10 points away from Peter Forsberg single tournament record, and 2-3 points behind Markus Naslund. Bodes well for his future.
Blew two, two goal leads. Questionable goaltending.
Bedard is one of a kind.  But Slovakia's goalie was the MVP of this game.
It is possibe beat Canada in this tournament....
Молодцы
canada going to get their ass handed to them whoever they meet in the semis.
Great goaltending from Slovakia, the cross checking though...disgraceful.
What kind of hockey program must the Slovaks have, to be able to send a team that goes toe-to-toe with the Canadians, right down to the wire?! The whole country only has 4 1/2 million people. Good on them! (However, they could sure lose those goons... We're lucky Bedard wasn't injured.)
Slovakia played great with incredible goaltending, but they also played quite unsportsmanlike cross checking any player they could after the whistle. I counted at least 8 that would have been penalties. It was obviously part of their gameplan, poor showing Slovakia.
Канадцы не чемпионы чемпионы Россияне , канадцы только и могут быть чемпионами когда России не
Beautiful winning goal
I'm feeling a lot better about the USA's chances after this game ngl, Go Americans!
Bedard really incredible.
with the McDavid cele.. too good
Hey TSN, please show more game footage.  The majority of this video is replay after replay.  Show the bits leading up to each event, not just the thing itself because that would help you get a feel for the game, the context.
WC withouth Russia is joke...no politics to sports!!!
Yeah but holy Conner bedard
Enjoy the win, Canada! Don't celebrate too hard, we don't need any more sexual assault allegations.
Russia
России нет(
beautiful game ♥
That desperation save by Tyson hinds and that beautiful goal from bedard in OT what amazing TALENT! Let’s go Canada!
What's with the Slovak guy and the drum?
Canada and the non-stop endless mistakes and damn near pissing game away
It's hilarious that Jordan Eberle was previous record holder 🤣🤣
If I didn’t know this was the quarter-final game, I would have thought it was the gold medal game. Absolute hats off to both teams. Such high level of play.
Why is Canada in BLACK all the time?     Are we the bad guys? Who makes us wear BLACK jerseys?       Are we trying to scare others? And why?                                                        I hate black jerseys.
Почему не засчитали гол Словакам, когда Канадский хоккеист отбил рукой шайбу?
Россия бы всех раскатала 🇷🇺>🇨🇦
poor sportsmanship by the Slovaks and their captain the whole game, especially at the end there with the crosscheck to the face and the 10s delay of game that went unpenalized in OT. All in all a good game, but you're kidding yourself if you think Slovakia deserved the win. Kudos to their goalie but all their goals were lucky as shit and purely caused by canadian brainfarts.
Too bad Montreal didn't allow "Slovakian Bedard" play...
Love how our Canadian boys didn’t lose their heads over the dirty hits just playing hard and sending the Slovaks home is the best way to do it!
That was a great game. Seriously, hats off to Slovakia, what a fantastic team, and their goalie is unreal. Glad to see Canada win.
holy fk that last goal, amazing from Bedard. Also huge props to Slovakian goalie, the guy was bombarded with shots
bedard can’t be bothered lmao
Slafkovsky might have been the difference maker. Bedard is a monster though.
Что за тигр это лев?!!
Some awful officiating in these quarterfinal games
Slovakian chlapci. You played great games at championship, but sport fortune wasn’t on your side. 🇸🇰your sports future is in front of you. You grab it and hold strong in your hands👍👍
Clovik всi прiслкрi
They didn’t show the clip of the Slovak lying on the puck wasting time that was pathetic. That pissed me off but good game!

Nemecs really cost his team with all those dirty cross-checks
now I want my Hurricanes to tank lol, Bedard is the next great one
I enjoyed that.
I am glad Canada didn't score on that "power play". That call was terrible and could have affected that entire result.
For what we could see, Slavakia have played really dirty...
Canada is enjoying the win as if its final… and they were playing against the smallest dwarf… isnt it a shame little bit ?  I am proud of our boys 🤟🏻 GG
Looks like louongo dive .never worked then won't work now.
#7 nemics can’t handle the pressure from a 17 year old lmao get good nerds
Slovaks actually thought they were gonna do something here😂😂 maybe next year…
bedard is a beast
I hate dirty teams.  It's one thing to hit and play hard, but I've lost all respect for the Slovaks after this display.  They played well all tournament, but their dirty play this game disgusted me.  They deserved to lose.  It would be fitting for any or all Canadian players to skate past the Slovak bench and give them the one finger salute.  Slovakians should be ashamed.
Did the Ref really say Canadia?
Booooo-Hooooo crying Slovack Eastern Euro Trash players!😪😢😭
Imagine what happened if Slafkovsky played in Overtime ...
the goalie !!!!!!! insane
В конце он их в одиночку убил
Canada have bedard , but Slovakia dont have Slafkovsky... Montreal dont give us our bigest star in hockey thats why we loss
It hurts to think that Bedard will end up on some shit franchise like Arizona or Columbus. Maybe Chicago can find some lottery luck. 🤞
Without Russians all hockey is half sucks
This was by far one of the best hockey games I've ever seen! Records broken, insane goaltending, plenty of drama and Bedard finishing it in OT on perhaps one of the prettiest goals in WJC history after nearly losing it minutes before. If you want to introduce someone to the best sport in the world, show them this fucking instant classic.  Seeing the kids crying reminds us all how young these kids are and how much playing for your country means to these kids.
This bording without Russia (
Spectacular!  As a Pats fan, I’ve seen a lot of magic from this kid, but that was off the charts!
To our Slovak brothers and sisters; you guys should be so proud of your team. You beat the Americans 6-3 in the preliminary games, and you brought Canada to overtime. Those were the two best teams (on paper). Major respect to you guys.
Krásný hokej od kluků slovenských, nádhera, jak se ti Kanaďané vždy zlobí když hraje někdo stejně tvrdě jako oni.Strašně jsem vám fandil .Je to škoda ale roste vám generace moc šikovnejch hokejistů. Přijde den kdy tu Kanadu zašlapete. A díky za krásnej hokej co kluci hráli...fanda z Moravy
За последние 10 лет чемпионом мира среди юниоров Канада была 4 раза, США и Финляндия по 3 раза, Шведы 1 раз- русских в победителях небыло..... 💙💙💛💛
Wow! this kid is absolutely Bedarded!
Slovaks just like the Chechia were really impressive imo. They play their systems much better than the big four. Canada despite being far more talented have been sloppy in every game except the Sweden game.  But gotta give huge props too Bedard who willed us too victory last night. I'm never for tanking but as a nucks fan it would be so serendipitous to have our 1st #1 ever be a local kid who dreamt of being a nuck his whole life.
As a Canadian  I was routing for the Slovak. A small country with a smaller draft and they went all the way to ot. Their goal keeper was game mvp in my mind.
What a game !!
🇨🇦👍👍👍
Словаки красавцы !!!! Respect!!!! pekní Slováci!!!!!!
Slovakia is one of my favourite hockey teams now. sort of reminds me of Croatian soccer team!  that was a barn-burner of a game. one of the better games i've seen.
HOLY SHIIIIIIIT
Good Game.
Wow
Plz hockey god make Conor Bedard a part of the HABS
as a canadian the slovaks played thier hearts out no lie about that gotta give them credit
Russia no???? Fack you american Russia hockey super .bidon pidoras urod .
Now its my turn after people trolling FIFA world cup,   yeah 8 teams..every year...woopie doo dah day.   Canada and there dives as well.    Come on 3rd period last minute???  That def was not a penalty...big time dive !!!!!
Canada was in huge trouble here. Everone giving props to slovakian goalie but That save with the tip of the pad/skate in OT was crucial. As expected Canada was given a PP in OT. Czechs and slovaks have found something again. I predict a final between Can a CZE and if the refs can be fair, we might see a great fight.
Gratulujem chalanom za bojovnosť.. teraz to medaila nebola ale nabudúce určite bude..
The energy in that arena is just unbelievably awesome. Good job to the Slovaks they played great especially the goalie
Dobry mecz. 🇸🇰🇵🇱
Жалко словаков, мне их игра больше понравилась
As a Canadian and a goalie that Slovakia goalie is amazing
if was there slafkovsky canada doesnt have any chance.
Не переживайте ребята, вы всеравно хорошо играли и в добавок против кого👍👍👍
ho wow realy nice game
Why is Dale Hunter not coaching he won gold
Oouufff une chance que Connor Bedard nous à sauver. Sa l’aurais été une consternation du Pays !
16😘🇨🇦👍👍👍 Канада!!!!✌✌✌✌
Slovakia really gave Canada a scare, I think if Slafkovsky was on the team  it would have tipped the scales. Don't know why the Habs were so intent in letting him sit over the Holidays when at 18 he should have been there.  Bedard is great but what a Baby his antics won't fly in the NHL whatever team he lands with.  Just play hockey NHL players are watching and noticing how easy it is to get him off his game
What a goal by Bedard in OT... Super amazing, beating whole defence. Go Canada for Gold.......
I absolutely love how game Slovakia 🇸🇰 was this night. Their goalie was stellar, Nemecs was clutch, and the whole team played gritty to make it a fantastic game. I truly feel bad that they had to experience coming up short after such an effort. Seems to have mostly come down to the fact that we 🇨🇦 just had Bedard. We’re lucky for that. Over the moon, but lucky none the less. I’m just grateful to all these players for showing us the fruits of all their lifetimes hard work. Amazing hockey!!!!!
This game was I N S A N E
Goat 🐐
Slovakia unable to clear and the canadians made them pay to advance
Little Slovakia vs big hockey monster Canada. 11,000 vs. 550,000 registered players and only 1 goal difference?  Lucky Canada.  VERY GOOD JOB SLOVAKIA !!!! We are proud of the Slovak boys' performance!
Вот это канадец! В стиле Кросби прошел и забил! Обидно за словаков!!!
Great game! Could’ve went either way! The boys left it all out on the ice and that’s all you can ask for. Bedard is definitely going to be a great player in the NHL as will Nemec and the Slovak goalie. Will be interesting to see which team gets Bedard. I wonder if the NHL has figured out which team they’re going to rig the draft for this year? My guess is Arizona, Philly, Anaheim, but most likely Montreal or possibly Vancouver. Highly likely they want him on an American team as it’s all about the Benjamins, Ruth, Gary Bettman
I'm EXHAUSTED just watching! Well done Slovakia you gave Canada its best challenge yet! Kudos to goalie Gajan! He stopped 57 SHOTS! NHL here you come!!!
I'm happy to see a game like this happen in the Maritimes.
That Slovak goalie is a legend! That game could have gone either way with the open ice of 3 on 3 play. Just a few years ago Canada/Slovakia was a no contest match up. What a game! You know it's a great game when deep down you want your team to win, but feel if it goes the other way you'd have a smile on your face for the opponent in a well deserved win.
World jr's are not the same with out Russia to bad the USA/Nato formed a coup against Russia in 2014 it should had been USA not allowed to play stop buying in to this Western Propaganda people
Both played well. Svk goal was brilliant.
why no Russian team this year ?
ДОСТОЙНО ИГРАЛИ СЛОВАКИ!     P.S. Я КАЗАХ
The Slovak goalie was awesome but how can you not blow the whistle when the Slovak player was on the puck the almost screwed the game
Bedard shows us how much wright sucks
Why did slovak defense just cross check everyone
Im Canadien, but i was finding myself rooting for Slovak to keep it close. Was best game ive seen in a long time. Happy to see Mesar playing so well. Slovaks played unbelievable. So much passion. Not sure Canada would have won without Bedard. What a beast.
Those Slovaks were feisty!! But a hell of a GWG by Bedard. 😁
Anyone else think Slovak's goalie will become the future Carey Price?
If we won against Switzerland we could prevent this 🥲
The Slovak goalie was dialed in and put on a show! Bedard's keen hockey sense knew he couldn't beat him by shooting. Great game.
If they didn’t have there jerseys on you would of sworn Slovakia was the North American team and Canada was the euro’s. The refs put the whistles away for both teams and Canada got bullied for most of this game but they did a good job not letting shots get through to the net and they made the most of there skill when giving the chance.
Man Bedard is just insane. Hes jot even drafted yet and has 2 more years of eligibility wtf guy is crazy
As if the slovak goalie didn’t get player of the game for his team, absolute robbery
that second slovak goal tho :) so smoof  but yeah, Bedard, you can't stop that guy it seems
wow this kid is something special , congrats Canada
Well played Slovakia!  -Fin
Lol, Canada almost humiliated the second time. :-D
That’s a disgusting goal 😷🤧
Hats off Canadians, you were much better, deserved win truly. But our boys fought really well and till the end, even in 3rd period we had some really good chances for 4th goal. But this win was truly deserved for Canada, good luck !
😂😂🎉 Gg Slovaquie 🇸🇰 You cant blâme you
slovak #21 rip
That OT goal is one for the history books! That matches Bobby Orr’s famous diving goal! 😲😲😲
Pěkně kluci ! Moc koukatelný hokej !
Canadians - fucki'n behaviour, shit-talking , provoking - if there are new world champions - no any respect to them. Just a bunch of arrogant jerks.... Home arena ,home referry , pressure - that's as usually ,all understandable . But ... just don't became a dick... Respect to slovaks - seen more sportsmanship - manhoodlike ethics and character . And that count's more in life.
Aight, that Bedard guy is pretty decent
nobody in the tournament  close to Bedard
Fuj kanada
One for the ages can’t be understated
i cannot wait to see this dude in the show
Excellent game by Slovakia!  🇨🇦
Nasty double team cross check.  Get cross Czechs...
slovaks deserved this. how many shitty penalties do you need to give up just because you’re mad? tied at 30 seconds no less. are these guys being injected with trenbolone? lol
Jordan who???
Damn, without context this was final level match. Both teams had lucky and unlucky moments and you can say "if this wasnt post, it wouldnt be ot" etc.. but daaaaaamn, that Petrovsky's chance should be a goal. Nevermind, i had to admit i was a bit skeptic before the game, but wow they fight all the night. Congratz to CA. What a match
Adam Gajan will play in the NHL he was unbelievable all tournament
Huge shouts to Slovakia. Created an insane game. Your goalie played incredible as well. GGs.
The game winner in ot was like rudolf balcers in 2018 iihf world championship latvia vs norway
As good as Bedard is the defenders were standing still, made it easy when all you do is poke check. One or two steps and they could have stopped him.
❤❤❤
Slovak player blowing kisses to the crowed LOL.. spoke too soon kid
The slovakian goalie made a name tonight, this would have been a disaster without him
Canada are just fkn incredibly good, I think they will win the whole tournament.
one of the biggest goals in Canadian hockey history.   Bedard.  Wow!
penalty trouble costing teams... quit cross checking and you wont be down a man in OT lol
That Slovakian goalie deserves a medal
A moving finish.
Nevadí, byli jste lepsi tým slovensko a my vas pomstime, priste uz to vyjde ;)
Incredible.
What a game
Referee didnt see 3 second hook by canada infront of their goal? Kinda boring seeing home referees every wc that Canada hosts
Maybe throwing kisses at the crowd and vicious cross checks aren’t that great for hockey karma. Slovakia did play well though and the goalie was unbelievable.
Канада может рвать и метать,но с русскими играть им престижнее.
This guy has 20 points on this tournament holy
Absolutely amazing game. Both teams were on fire. After the heartstopper that was Sweden-Finland, I didn't expect much from this game. While Slovakia really impressed me against the US, Canada is Canada. Moreover, the match was in the middle of the night for me. However, I took a nap after our game and then saw this game. And holy moly. It was the best match of the tournament, easily. Of course it would be Bedard that nailed it in the end, but my god, what a match by Slovakia. What a comeback. Comebacks! Incredible.  Slovakia will be a monster going forward. It'll be really interesting to see them play in the regular WC and Olympic games. It wouldn't surprise me if the NHL picks up a lot of them as well.
Good game all around. Something with the name Conner lol
US wins gold with Canada playing like this. US plays like an actual team and not a group of individuals
Holy mackerel
without Russia in the tourney it is a diluted competition .. Russia not being there is like Canada not being there .. every medal winner will know it would have been different had Russia been there .. asterisks needed for sure for the WJC 2023 .. shame on Hockey Canada and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for punishing innocent teenagers ..
I don't like when referees decide to take sides in any game. Thankfully it didn't affect the final outcome of the game.
Slovakian heroes. Man, a player like Bedard will eventually get mangled by someone. Hes a tiny, skilled player that behaves like a prick. At some point someone will hurt him,  very bad.  Was refreshing to see Sweden vs Finland the other day. None of this stupid crap where you start f*cking around after efter whistle.
Gratulujem Kanada.   Ďakujem Slovenská mládež.   Pekný hokej 🏒
16 номер у Листьев неутомим!
Канада слабенькая! Россия лучшая в мире!!! А этот чемпионат без России, чемпионат  США а не мира!!!
Fk Canada, Slovaks, you are the real men, you are the best, go ahead Slovakia ✊
Greetings from Russia.  I would like Slovakia to win, but Bedard Connor did not allow it, I hope the Czech Republic will win this championship, avenge their brothers, well, or the Swedes, if they turn out to be stronger, in any case, beat the Canadian at home in the final, it's worth a lot, it was  in 2011, and I want the European team to do it, we will cheer for Chekhov and the Swedes, all of the world
why watch this when there are REAL sports like NFL football to watch?
Slovakia robbed. love from Finland!
Жапрақтар жақсы женыс
Slovakia with broad street bullies inspiration as they cannot stop Bedard any other way.
Imagine if they had Slafkovsky as well, might've even pulled out the win
What a game!  That winning goal in overtime was awesome. But also the Slovakian goal for 2:3 was just purely amazing!
Man I was hoping Slovakia would win
I dont care which one, i just hope bedard gets to play in a canadian team
OH YEAH !  GOLD IN HALIFAX !    OH CANADA !        DML
Every year in this tournament the officiating is highly questionable. In a quarter final you would expect an experienced crew, but these people did not appear to have ever seen a hockey game before. They allowed the Slovaks to beat on the Canadians for most of the game, with cross checks, roughing, punches, and face washes that in any other match, if Canadians had done the same, they would have been penalized. The linesmen missed several clear offsides that led to Slovak shots on goal. The interference in the crease should never have been allowed. But Bedard shrugged off the abuse and scored a legendary goal to make the worst of the thugs cry like babies, so karma prevailed. But the IIHF should send those officials to a re-education camp, and pay back the money they took to try their damnedest to keep the hosts out of the gold medal game. In any other sport there would be an inquiry. Not in international hockey.
Stupid commentator see the cross check but didnt see the stick to the goalie hand?
historical moment omfg THATS FAWKIN INSANE CONNOR BEDARD🔥🔥🔥
My coworkers son played against Bedard, He mentioned Bedard to me a few years back as a player to look out for and I was like yah yah yah whatever cool
To čo Slováci predvádzali bolo neskutočne 🇸🇰
Holy cross checks!
Epic match
What a shame Slovakia didn't have Slafkovský the outcome would have been different
Well fought Slovakia! Thanks for an exciting game!
Congrats to the Slovaks goalie, to the rest of the Slovaks, never seen so many crosschecks in a single game, kinda dirty. But doesn't matter, the team with double the shots won. Without the Slovaks goalie game could've been 9-3
Wow🤨CANADA 🥰😄😊🙏✌👍🤝
Geee...I can't upstand why Slovakia would check him like that?!!😥After all he is such a great player, the lead scorer in the whole tournament!   Officially, that was a vicious brutal well taken opportunity to  check Connor Bernard!!! Unofficially, I didn't see a damn thing. And if it did, and Connor is drafted to the NHL, this is not going to be the first time he'll be checked like that! I really wanted Slovakia 🇸🇰 to win it, they are a good teaml Thus giving Team USA 🇺🇸 another shot at gold🥇 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
AHOI AHOI TEAM SLOVENSKO !!! YOU PLAYED ENOUGH WELL TO WIN !!!  AHOI AGAIN !!!
Bedard making Canadian History at age 17. Unreal. Props to Slovaks goalie, only reason the game was so close
Словаки молодцы 👏
What a kid!😵 playing like McDavid 😅
Канадцы Молодцы но очень много не использовали моментов если бы использовали хотя бы половина то выиграли бы с крупным счётом
Heave Away Boys !
Slovaks deserved more but not more than bedard
Вратарь сборной Словакии держал игру..
Both keepers played extremely well! Huge saves knowing the game could have been either way! One of the best wjh games I've ever seen!
Refs tried to rig it for Slovakia, and they still fall.
WOW what a game hats off to the slovakian goalie, He played insane ..Great game
7:55 pathetic embellishment.a bad call
it's a pity that slovakia lost. they played great. the struggle was fierce on both sides.
were just better 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
What a game and what a finish by Bedard! Respect for Slovakia giving a good effort. As a Panthers fan it's so painful to see them going to miss the playoffs and not only that but missing a chance to get this kid in the draft 😪.
Gajan vs Bedard, battle of two titans. Slovakia played with all their hearts, it was an awesome battle and we are very proud of you, for us you are the best ❤ Canada very good game and congratulations to your well earned victory 🇸🇰🤝🇨🇦
Словакия молодцы несмотря на проигрыш эта была достойная игра привет из 🇷🇺
As painful as it is, the turth of the matter is this - had the Slovaks won the game against the Swiss, they could have played for medals - now they cannot. If I were a player, I'd be furious - what a chance thrown away. They must learn from this.
Gg, thanks, Canada
Pěkně kluci ! Moc koukatelný hokej !
Lets go czech brothers❤️🇨🇿
ГОЛ !!!!!!!! РЕШАЮЩИЙ,ПО ИСПОЛНЕНИЮ,ИЗУМИТЕЛНЫЙ!!!!!!!!! ОТЫГРЫВАТЬСЯ....ВСЕГДА СЛОЖНО!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Словаки лучшие!!!
This Canada team total trash and fucking selfish Bedard deserve more big hits on him
What a great game by both teams. The future of Slovak hockey is very bright!
I wish the leafs could have bedard man
3 guys all taking the puck, none taking the man. Great goal, but why oh why wasn’t he laid flat? Those boys had the Czech removed from them.
zedli spod kona trapkovia
🇷🇺Russia  win  !!!
Awesome job Slovak with the game      But some of your players were asses
Bedard bust or nah? He is the next great one.
That Bedard guy, and Slovaks fighting hard gj
Без России это не чемпионат!
Slovakia - way better than the Swedes, anyway hope for the Czech rematch against Canada in the finals.
Slovakia played great, but they played absolutely dirty.
We can say the Slovaks played dirty, but they gave it their all, and were in the mix to win the game. Slovakia is a less talented team than Canada, everyone knows this; so they had to play a physical style to have a chance, and rely on good goaltending. Great game from several Canadian players, but Bedard willed this team to a victory.   Well played Slovakia, you have our respect.
Canada outplayed, and out shot the Czech Republic like 5 to 1. I'm surprised it's as close as it was.
09:16 what the heyal was that Slovakian player doing shooting the puck right to Bedard. You had all the time and space to just settle the puck and skate it behind the net.  But nah I'll just shoot the puck right to bedard. Game freakin over. Brutal.
Gord Miller is horriawful on his goal calls
That Bedard guy is a prodigy. Interesting to see if he is able to keep it up in the NHL and raise to challenge McDavid. Maybe a modern-day Gretzky - Lemieux rivalry? Could be hopium though. Anyway, gg both teams. And big congrats to team Canada! Greetings from Finland.
In the semis the opponent should just put three guys on bedard all the time and not worry about anything else.
RUSSIA IS THE CHAMPION!!!
Словаки красавчики!
Pause this video at 8:59. Usually teams don't get this close to eliminating Canada from tournaments. Slovaks respect a ton of respect for this, especially when you realise that similar teams played last summer and Canada won 11-1 back then.  Teď v češtině, odvedli jste skvělý výkon, nemáte se zač stydět. Naopak, těším se, co tihle kluci ještě dokážou.
What a game! Literally could have gone either way!!!
9:15  When he missed here, the Slovakia player was like…Here try again 😅  Slovakia played great tho.  Especially the goalie
2000 registered players in Slovakia VS 2000 hockey stadions in Canada. David vs Goliath :)
That goal is going to haunt me for the rest of time
Canada   won with Slovakia   !!    where  population is  like  3 time less  !!    than population of province Ontario   !!!   wow  realy   Canada should be proud of  it
Slovakia beats them easy without Bedard
Yeah that Bedard goal is going to be a top 10 wjc moment for sure. BC pride! Lets go!!
Словакия показала реальный уровень игры! Ни чуть не хуже канадцев. За это им респект. А канадцам чуть больше повезло....
Wonder if he'll go in the first round
Both teams are good but hockey is our game baby
one of the filthiest game winners you'll ever see. an absolute all timer. they'll be talking about this 50 years from now
What a great game, either team could have won this one...what a beauty at the end...
Wow. I honestly wouldn’t have cared if Canada lost, that was an amazing game. Well played Slovakia!!!
canadiens are celebrating like they win something. No one cares these kind games when european teams have C grade players on lineup.
Omg poor Slovakia at the end there… It looks like a battlefield and Bedard decimated their entire platoon.
Greetings from Russia.  I would like Slovakia to win, but Bedard Connor did not allow it, I hope the Czech Republic will win this championship, avenge their brothers, well, or the Swedes, if they turn out to be stronger, in any case, beat the Canadian at home in the final, it's worth a lot, it was  in 2011, and I want the European team to do it, we will cheer for Chekhov and the Swedes, all of the world
I wish we could have played against canada, from Finland.
Ref you suck best chant ever🔥
Anyone else notice Clarke slamming his stick everytime he calls for pass like he's in peewee hockey
Took a dump right on the slovy flag with that one
Bedard is absolutely unbelievable. That kid is insane. Gg’s to Slovakia, what a game!
We didnt had Slafkovsky because of Montreal and NHL rather helps team Canada then Slovakia. Good job for that 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Slovakia respect!
great game .. although .. would be more interesting with Slaf on SVK side ...
Словаки красавчики !!!!
canada weak as f. this year! hockeynation my ass
Canada showed some serious flaw, they got lucky tonight.
Good game. Congrats from Russia. Cheered for Slavs though.
Crazy game!
Boo so close slovakia
škoda že to Repcik takto zahodil, byli jste tak blízko
škoda Slovensko, pěkný match, měli jste na to :( ... perfektní výkon. Bedard to vzal na sebe a vyšlo mu to, chce se prodat, ale ta sebestřednost z něj úplně stříká.
Congratulations to Canada from Slovakia.I believe that we ll win next time. Good match.
Is it not pronounced Roi(... like rwah maybe) as opposed to Wahh? It's spelt Roy, as in the ancient way of spelling king..
Looks like Slovakia got away with a ton of dirty shit around their net. Or maybe that's just because Team Canada dropped by for a visit too many times. :)
Slovakia played one hell of a game! I have my support! ❤️🇫🇮
truly great hockey game
when Slovakian tied the game, i knew that ref will give a penalty to them at the end of 3d period. Classic ref on World Juniors
Slovakia did cheapshot the whole game and still didnt get punish.. Imagine if Canada did the same they would have been in pk the entire game.... Of course Canada is better than slova but are they trying to make it more fair with poor referee? thats sad
NHL is a new monster for these small 1st overall's
As a Slovak, this was an instant classic! A pleasure to watch, just like the Finland-Sweden game. Good job both teams.
I’m so proud he is from where I live. North Vancouver Canada 🇨🇦
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Dear God, can somebody besides Canada or U.S.A win gold this year? Amen
Nothing more Canadian then scoring a beauty OT winner then having Heave Away start playing!! LETS GO CANADA!!!!!
💪💪💪💪🇨🇿🇸🇰🇨🇿🇸🇰🇨🇿🇸🇰🇨🇿🇸🇰🇨🇿🇸🇰🇨🇿💪💪💪💪💪💪 V sadě skví se jara květ, zemský ráj, to na pohled..... Ešte jedle rastú na krivánskej strane
Credit to Slovakia, especially its goalie, for putting up a fight and making Canada have to earn this win.  Go Canada go, on to the semis!!!
As a Slovak, Canadians don’t go down without a fight. I love Canadian as a Slovak gg!
As a Slovak Habs fan, I am now pissed at the org for not sending Salfkovsky. One goal would have made the difference.
Usa will beat canada easily.Too much mustakes.
Crazy amounts of posts . 9/10 this game is blow out for canada
Go Canada go champions
Takto to má sakra vyzerať!!!! krásny hokejový zážitok a to nie som ani veľký hokejový fanúšik ale Srdce bojovnosť tento zápas mal všetko len koniec nebol aký by sme chceli avšak dojem ste na mňa a určite celý hokejový svet zanechali nádherný!!!! Nejedno srdce zaplesalo!!! Ďakujem mladíci za krásny zážitok i keď som to videl len tu avšak radosť pozerať!!! škoda výsledku ale hlavu hore !!! Dúfam že naši českí Bratia teraz toto celé vyhrajú!!!vo finále pomstiť Slovákov proti Kanade..!!!😅🤣☺️😎
Slovakia earned some respect in the ice hockey world today. An amazing game. Congratulations 🇨🇦
Словаки играли как львы
Was that the finale? A perfect match. They wouldn't be ashamed of such a match even at the adult championships. The Slovaks deserved a medal for that combativeness. A goalkeeper from a completely different world. Congratulations Canada. So, now we just have to hope that the Czech Republic will win it. :)
Вытащили,полупокеров,за уши.
Словаки показали крутейший хоккей, это просто шок, я даже не помню, когда наши так играли, наверное, только когда было 3:5, пофиг на счёт, они показали, что могут так макать канадцев в грязь, красавцы!
I wanted Slovakia to win and I’m Canadian lol
What a hit from white #13 on black #5, beautiful then that the canadian is stupid to chase him back instead of going for a change thats a different thing
I see Sykora is embracing being a a Ranger missing open net
If only Montreal let  Juraj Slafkovsky go play, it would have been a different outcome.
отскочили бобрята) матрасы помогли) жаль словаков...
Wow, just wow, I'm so impressed by Slovakia, there is nothing more satisfying than when they score and it's absolutely dead quiet in the crowd.
Canada would never have gotten that last penalty. As Slovakia got.
Very nice game. I am so sad for Slovaks not going through considering that I am from Slovakia, but man, this guys Bedard. He will take the NHL by the storm. He is out of this world. And I really hope that Gajan will be noticed by NHL, too. He had a big tournament this time around.
Can't wait to see the Connors go head-to-head!
Halifax needs an NHL team. Blowing the roof off this tournament. Out-shining half the league any day of the week. What a game!
Great game both teams showed up
the craziest thing about slovak's team is that most of the guys will be there next year so it might be even crazier
Bobby Orr goal for Connor ...niceee ...have good game plan against next opponent ...follow through (maybe give Dale Hunter a call 📞, see what he thinks 🤔) 🏒🍁
Добрый день всем!Я напишу своё мнение.Всех с Новым годом!Всем здоровья и благополучия желаю!Жаль,что спорт площадкой для мотивации ненависти к Российской Федерации!
I wish Bedard would have blown a kiss to the Slovakian bench😘
Very impressed with the Slovakian team. They played like lions
без РФ скучно
20  years later we’re gonna get a “I was in net for Connor Benares game winning goal against Slovakia”
Only TERRORISTS vote 'conservative.'
“B-Man” with that OT goal! He showed the Slow in Slovakia!😜🏒🥅
Once again, the Slovakian goalie puts on the performance of the tournament against Canada, IN Canada.  Once again, the Slovakians take us to WAR every minute of a hockey game.  You guys always push us to the absolute limit, hats off to you Slovakia!  Love and respect from Canada.
Bedard is on another planet, Slovaks may have lost the game but guys you won our hearts <3 best of luck to y'all in draft cheers from Slovakia
Bedard has all the talent in the world and then some, but boy, he’s not exactly classy. Goes in for some push&shove in front of the Slovak net, gets absolutely eaten one-handedly by the Slovak. The next thing he does after he scores a goal is to find the first Slovak, and rub it in his face. That will win you many fans in the NHL, Connor.
Canada lucky
What a sad end to the game when we could have had a Slovakian upset
без россии нет хоккея
Lucky you have bedard
I'm not interested in hockey, but the away team has to win a game like this. Especially, I wanted to see the crumpled faces of white Canadian people filling their home stadium, but it's even more annoying because it's a dramatic victory.
Красивый хоккей, настоящая заруба!
This reminds me of the Calgary Dallas series in the NHL playoffs last year...
Connor Bedard:  OH CANUCKS FOR SURE!
Now that’s what the “beautiful game “ looks like, and no one rolling around on the ice trying to draw a penalty 😂
connor beddard is HIM
Yo they got casper as a camera man?!?!?!?!?!
Судьи как могли так и тащили Канаду
Der Junge #16 ist ne Sensation!!!🏒 Hockey  ❤️❤️❤️
As the commentator said at the end - this kid is out of this world! What a goal... Kudos to Slovakia, they almost pulled this one off and they should be proud forever for the game they played...
“THIS WILL BE A HIGHLIGHT GOAL FOR YEARS” 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bedard is something else. As a Canucks fan, I'd love to keep this kid in Vancouver for his entire career. If only my team wasn't so insistent on being mediocre.
that poor goalie, 60 shots vs 20 and still makes it to OT
Slovakia❤
5:19 Chris Tucker screaming "You got knocked the fuck out!"
Heroický výkon, bratři. Nechybělo málo a vyřadili jste nejlepší mužstvo na turnaji. Dotahovat proti Kanadě je prakticky nemožné, ale vám se to povedlo.  Tato vaše generace ještě světu ukáže. Všichni příští soupeři Kanady mohou jenom snít o tom, že by odehráli takhle těsný zápas. I Švédy si namazali na chleba. Zatímco z vás mají ještě teď stažené půlky. Málem rupli v ČF doma.
If bedard ends up in Arizona I can imagine Matthew’s going there for the big contract and being a playoff team year one by power play advantage alone. Add a good D core and goalie and who tf knows how quick that could happen.  If my beloved dead wings somehow slip down and obtain him tho I’ll lose my shit. Chicago wouldn’t be the worst either, a good market. Domi would get suspended every game protecting the star lol   Nothing would be worse than like an Anaheim or San Jose, a hopeless hockey city. The only reason McDavid isnt a complete travesty all the way up in Alberta is because of their retro past with all the cups and hall of famers. I’ll even admit without tkachuck Calgary is boring again.
Is it me or more often that not, when some retard decides to slide on the ice like in 4:35, in this case, two malackas, a goal is scored. Montreal has been giving goals away like this recently. Stop sliding. You look fucking stupid doing it and it makes things worse more often than making it better.
Those Slovak boys done real good this year, Kudos to them.
Красавцы Словаки как Львы боролись, давно не видел чтоб так Канадцев лупили👍
That OT goal will live in World Junior lore for a very long time, if not forever. What a win for the boys!! GG, Slovakia, now bring on the USA!
But ,fuck you are super Slovak
My back hurts after watching that double cross check
Slovakia played so good they deserve more than quateer
Везёт Канаде!!!Но Чемпионами вам не стать!!!!!Слабые вы сейчас!да и России нет на чемпионате!!!Скучно Канада без России???!!!
That's why Hockey 🏒  is so  much better than Soccer Because it's faster and more physical and more scoring...Hockey Rules as a Team Sport
Это не чемпионат мира, а региональный турнир. Говорите верно.
I want to know what beaded said after the 2nd goal lol
Feel so bad for Slovakia
Канада зря радуешься ! Дальше будет 5 -0 от сша ..
3v3 overtime is kinda lame
Пацан, реально не с этой планеты!
I was at a restaurant during the last period of the game, didn't order until the small intermission between the third and OT. Was scared I'd miss something or we'd lose if I peeled my eyes from the screen. Watching OT was insanely nerve wracking but I'm so happy to have witnessed that beauty of a goal by Bedard. Good job Slovakia, you guys put up one hell of a fight!
Что творит этот парень!
That’ll be an all time classic even if it’s just the quarters
How the fuck are Canadians consistently lucky? Feel so bad for slovakia man.
This game left me with a bittersweet feeling. Slovak boys fought like I probably never seen them before. I’m beyond proud. This was hell of a game. Thank you for that. That’s why hockey is my number one sport in the🌎
8:45 Can we get some more love for Milis’s tournament saving stop? Without this Bedard doesn’t score and our “best team ever” doesn’t even get to play for a medal.
The future goat of the NHL with a legendary game winner. Good gawd!!!
Ref missed a pretty obvious elbow to the head and then calls an equipment penalty the other way to add insult to injury
Словаки молодцы, хорошо играли!💪💪💪
9:12
What a game. Also TSN has the best broadcast commentators for hockey. Go Canada Go.
Incredible Win!  ❤🇨🇦
Wow just wow. Bedard is just incredible
ЧМ без России - не чм.
Is Shane Wright a depth player now?
insane goaltending by the slovakian goalie, even more insane puck handling by bedard
Без России это не интересно !!!!! Канада отстой !
Cool
the Slovaks were kinda cocky and arrogant which in the end ..led to thier downfall
Shoutout to the crowd in Halifax. They’ve been electric all tournament. Absolute limbs
Wow so much respect for Adam Gajan. He just shot up the draft rankings for sure
Are defense seems week the game was way to close for the number of shots. But what an ending and what a game to watch.
this is the QUARTER FINALS?? how the hell are the semis or final supposed to top this?
Everyone is praising Slovakia and their goalie and how good he played and they played shake my head. How about how good Canada played and how they were unlucky. Canada hit I counted five goalposts in the third period and 1 in overtime. They could’ve easily have won 7-3 go, Canada go!!!!
Barely. Canada is going down not only politically, economically but also in hockey. Another year or two and Canada will be battling Latvia and Germany to get past first round
Slovakia did really well and came close but is no one going to talk about the double cross-check at 1:40?? It did make the ending a bit sweeter
the slovak players at the end are literal pylons lmao
Всё равно словаки молодцы ребята! Хорошая команда!
I love how the crowd is all CANADIAN YES YES YES
Всегда во все года Канада и США играет на спортивной фарме, они не могут себе позволить поражение из за престижа. Поэтому Словакия играла с роботами не поосто хорошо, а отлично. Когда придут года и они останутся без фармы, тогда весь Мир узнает как играет настоящая  Канада и США. Браво Словакия - - - спасибо за праздник и характер игры. 👋👋👋🇸🇰🇸🇰🇸🇰🇸🇰👍👍👍
Словаки молодцы, играли мужественно. Они заслужили победу
That crosscheck penalty was rigged Bedard sucks
Это нас Русских нет Былабы вам   Жопа
Slovakia the dirtiest scum in the tournament!!
schade das Russland nicht dabei sein darf
Wow!!!! Bedard
Словаки, вы лучшие! Играли как Россия! Чехи, порвите этих канадских ребят!
Slovaks were so dirty with the cross checks, suck that you losers.
CANADA САМЫЕ ЛУЧШИЕ! 💪👍👌🙂
All due respect to Slovakia for coming this far and doing this well, but my god they are dirty its insane
I mean Hats off to Slovakia(for all that it’s worth now)
Bedard 💩
🇸🇰🇸🇰🇸🇰🇸🇰
Россия бы такую Канаду на запчасти разобрала, позорище
Последний гол Канадцев это пиздец
The best player in the world that’s not in the NHL
Canadian corpses, they can't.  Disgrace!!!
To be honest if it weren't for the posts and the ungodly performance of the Slovak goalie, this game should have been a 5 goal difference.  The shots and chances weren't even close.  Hats off to the kid, wow just wow.
That last goal must sting like hell... giveaway under no pressure leading to the winning goal for Canada.
The Slovak goalie was the only reason it was close. Bedard is unreal, just walked the team in ot.
АХ КАК ЖАЛЬ ,  ЧУТЬ ЧУТЬ НЕ ПОВЕЗЛО СДЕЛАТЬ  КАНАДУ . СЛОВАКОВ УДАЛЯЛИ  БОЛЬШЕ.   СЛОВАКИЯ 👍👍👍👍👍🔥👏👏👏👏
Canada sucking sucking sucking
This came really close to being a super disappointing tournament for Canada.  Some really bad defensive mistakes they will need to fix if they hope to have any chance to win  this.  The games only get tougher.
Was absolutely unreal to witness this in person 🙌🙌
Nemecs sure loves to cross check.
Amazing job to Slovakia and the Slovakian Goalie! Lets go Canada!
Beautiful move by Bedard at the end. Really shows how skilled he is... Hopefully it will translate to the NHL. So far looking amazing.   But, I have to say that the turnover at the end by the slovak player was really bad. He had the puck after the first save on Bedard, no real threat from Canada and he could have easily gone behind the goal and slowed down the play for a change or passed to the right wing to start an attack. Instead he just randomly threw the puck away (I guess in panick?) and it went right to Bedard. I am sure the slovakian player will see his mistake and learn from it after the game but it is worth pointing out. Hats of to Slovakia though, they played Canada hard and their goalie was amazing. It was a really entertaining game.
Petrovský in overtime what a chance....
Epic awesome time tuned in during the 3rd period and got too watch the GWG! Hopefully we can advance past usa
Absolutely a generational talent 👏🏾 it's an honor to see him play.
It was nice game.
I mean Canada is basically a 1 man team. Bedard wins every game for them. He’s a hell of a fuckin player. Great game . Slovakia put on a performance to be proud of
Canada cannot seem to play 2way hockey and solid defence. Defence is a team effort. This must improve.
When the US plays Canada in the finals they better take Bedard's head off in the first shift. Turn him into a human vegetable.
What a fantastic game, Canada won but only with a super-human effort. Slovakia was outstanding! 17 year old phenom Connor Bedard is from my Hometown of North Vancouver and played on the West Vancouver Academy Prep team, of course leading the league in scoring. A buddy of mine drove the school bus for road trips and said I should come see a game just to see this phenomenal kid people were comparing to Wayne Gretzky for years already. Like Wayne he played against older boys and I believe will be the next Superstar in the NHL. I look forward to the Semi-Final game on January 4th against the high scoring American team who easily beat Germany.
One of the most thrilling quarter-final game in WJC history imo. What a gritty game Slovakia played! 🇨🇦🇸🇰
Без России это не то
What a game!!
4:31
Lmao canada almost lost to slovakia hahaha
СССР сила !
Bedard is cold-hearted assassin.  McDavid is calling up for an appointment with his therapist.
I can’t help but laugh at how fast the camera skater man in white got out ther3 — the real unsung hero
Some silly plays by slovakia,. But I appreciate their passion. Their goalie played well, down the stretch.  But that save by Milic in OT I was sure that was in lmfao insane.   Next up: the U.S. let's goooo 🇨🇦
Great play by Bedard!  The slovak's goalie played a hell of a game.
8:56 That made me moist 😩
#21 had control of the puck with nobody near him and he handed it to Bedard.  What was he thinking.  Had to admire the Slovaks physical play.  I do believe Canada hit five posts in the third period and ot.  But kudos to the Slovaks.
Pretty sure u can't do that even in a video game! Probably the prettiest game winner in 🇨🇦 Hockey ever! Keep Rolling Boys!
He currently has 32 points on his IIHF World Jr career! Hard to believe Forsberg put up 31 points in a single tournament 😂
shame that kid has to go to Chicago...
I hope the Slovakian team gives their goaltender some love after this because he was fantastic for them in this game.  It's a bummer to lose but he was instrumental in keeping them in the game into overtime. GG Slovakia!
For bedard to get hounded, provoked, pushed, crosschecked, and frustrated the whole game by a slovakian team with a lot of heart on a mission to get under his skin, for him to come out on top and bury them with an outrageous OT goal like that.. this kid is no skill over grit glass cannon who's afraid to get his hands dirty while still wanting all the glory. After that first game, people criticized him as an egotistical player, and in a way, they were right. He does have an ego, the ego of a champion. The ego to put his team and country on his back and skate head first into a team of guys who want nothing more than to pound him into the ice. The kind of ego that knows he's the best player on the ice and understands that that only means he needs to work harder than everyone else; because he's the one who can make a difference. He really is THAT guy, pal.
9:18 That other sound you hear is people tanking in their fantasy pool to get the first overall pick
Slafkovsky could play on this WC for slovaks or he older 20
Unbelievable Bedard and Milic should be the top 2  stars of that game
I have to give some props to my boy Eric Lindros for his great tweet telling Bedard to smash his record. Class act.
Thank you both Teams for this amazing Hockey Feast! It was a real joy to see you on the ice!
Wow wow wow what a goal. Slovakia tou guys played like Lions. great game.
I'm at a loss for words
Bernard ehh. 👏
Congrats to everyone, I'm lifting up a tequila for all tonight.
Slovaks are sick, clarke got decked so hard his helmet and stick flew away sheesh that was nasty🤣🤣 he was skating around no stick no helmet n got a penalty🤣
Словацкий обсос не смог шайбу из зоны выкинуть! У род, руки из ж о пы! Так им и надо! "До последнего словака!"
As a Canadian Slovakia goalie played well hat offs to Slovakia Connor bearded is so grosss what a goal what. Game
Repick should have gone for the hit on Bedard, or at least tried to stop his body. Altho, to be fair, you'd rarely ever see a hit in that situation.
CONNOR BEDARD, (FUTURE) YOTES LEGEND
Dang. Connor Bedard is going to have some career in the NHL when he gets drafted. He is an elite player!
5:36 Великолепный хит!!!
Россия 🇷🇺 чемпион
Canadian here. Lifelong hockey player and fan as well. Facts coming up, sorry if your butt hurts afterwards. 4th expected, 3rd would be cool. These kids (yes, they are KIDS) do not have the mental capacity yet to win this tournament. The skill, yes, but not the ability, yet. Say what you want, I'll be back to prove I'm right.
Бедарда надо в СКА.
Thank you very much Slovakia for your outstanding effort and performance!!! You are one of the best teams in the world. And good luck to Team Canada in the finals!
GET THAT cameraman wearing all white OFF THE ICE!  Embarrassing.
Who still cheers for these future rapists. Hockey Canada breeds future predators
Jesus! What a terrific game! What a terrific tournament! Both teams were playing incredibly well. But the Canadians were unstoppable. Connor Bedard is becoming a legend. And thank you very much Slovakia for your outstanding effort and performance!!! You are one of the best teams in the world. Thank you both teams for this amazing Hockey Feast! It was a real joy to see you on the ice!
Canucks need to go into full tank mode to get Bedard.  Bring him home! Lol
I will enjoy following Bedards career and remembering this tournament. Congrats Canada from Sweden 🇨🇦
Nice goal by Bedard no doubt about but the defending was so bad do they not teach defenseman to take the body and ignore the puck anymore?
I don't know why, but the World Juniors are such a different breed of Hockey and it's amazing
I know he's not Canadian but that game winner was Peter forsberg-esque.. a beauty!!
I haven't followed hockey in ages and this is the first I'm seeing of Bedard. Man can that kid dangle!
Wow, what a game. Gongrats to 🇨🇦 from 🇸🇰.  I really thought this will be a massive one-sided game for Canada, but On the end I am happy to salute to both. Amazing 👏  See you next year
Do you HEAR that Nemic!?
Those cross checks were foul that could easily break a spinal column
Refs kept Slovakia in that one eh. Man, didn't know Europeans could goon all day and get away with it. I expected more dives tbh.
Without a referee the Cans could easily loose. The circus "2023 World juniors" is setup for Canada - USA finals. Disgusting
Connor Bedard is on another planet, the best player of the WJC
Great game, let’s go boys
Bernard should be in the NHL for his Overtime move now. That was nasty.
good game... but the Slovaks had no business to be in this game being outshot 41 to 18 on the tie goal. I stopped counting Nuck posts after 5
Feel for Slovakia. They were one of the most fun teams to watch this tournament. I know this sucks, but they should be really proud of their showing.  This Canadian team will be in trouble if a team can shut down Bedard…massive if though.
what a game
Canada can be ashamed of such a result.  Slovakia can take it very far in the future.
If I was a scout I’d be infatuated with that Slovak goalie . Impressive ! I think he has a bright future if he maintains
Slovakia gave it their all, holy crap much respect to them!
it's fantastic!  It's like the heroes of the nation!!!
IT WAS AN INSANE GAME (CONNOR BEDARD IS INCREDIBLE) ... WE WANT YOU BUDDY at MTL 🔵⚪🔴
Bedard is king 👑
Connor Bedard took a whole nation on his back!
It’s the Bedard Show,Ggs Slovakia you guys played amazing!
McDavid vibes on that last goal, what a solo play
After so many mistakes, bedard finally redeems himself
Best game of the tournament respect Slovakia
Even tho they literally taunted the crowd with 0 respect after scoring 1 goal. I feel for Slovakia. Maybe not a good move to taunt the crowd next time because you end up lookin real bad. Canada don’t disrespect any team but they constantly got other teams bein mad disrespectful. If somebody was up 10-0 on Canada you know damn well they’d be rubbing it in. Great performance by the Slovakian’s but next time be a bit more classy If you’re gonna cry at the loss.
Awsome game both sides and hoping that Adam Gajan to be draft by Mtl
Damn Slovakia was impressive during this game, and especially the last period. They really deserved to win. I'm speechless.
They will love this kid in Arizona and the new building.
Arrogant Canada almost lost.
Slovakia is a dirty team especially that nemecs SOB
Holy shit! Bedard is a monster! Slovakia was great too.
Legit wanted the Slovaks to pull out a dub - great game to watch
it's disgusting to watch, without Russia it looks like a jackal competition.
Wow, what an overtime goal. He's amazing. Looked like the other Conner McD God man
Wow!
Fun fact, Canada got more stadiums, than Slovakia registered ice hockey players. Gg Im proud of our team SVK.
idk who that slovak goalie is. If he's undrafted, someone should draft him.  Slovakia, should be proud. They played so well.
Slovakia is really good!
Ohh god... Bedard is a spoiled child... But incredible talent
Omg conor bedard welcom to canada team
Good game boys. All of you should be proud.
Have to feel bad for Repcik. He knew he screwed up by swatting at the puck under pressure instead of maintaining control and he ended up passing it right back to Bedard. Can't make mistakes with this Canadian team. Really good game, though.
Those Slovaks played there heart great game! canadas defence is really scary
Draft that Slovak goalie!
All you bozos bitching about the refs and cheap shots... You sure you don't live down South? That's just hockey, fellas.  If it was the other way around you'd be singing a very different tune; no doubt.   Take some pointers from most of the other comments - be respectable winners - and leave the bitching and moaning to the Yanks.
Great game Slovakia, great effort
Words cannot describe the disgust I have for these refs. The way they called the game is an absolute disgrace. Fucking incredible game and I’m more than impressed with Slovakia and their goalie but there was so much wrong with this game from an officiating standpoint. I SERIOUSLY think those refs should never be allowed to ref this tournament again. It’s like they just grabbed people who said they can ref. I really don’t think some of them actually understand a lot of the rules.
We are watching a god awake. Go Canada !!
slovakia great game, aweasome, Russia - Slovak🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
Would love to see the increase in Slovakia jersey sales after this. What an effort
This is an all time game. Leaving this here for when I inevitably come back to watch it again
57 shots 🇨🇦  26 shots 🇸🇰   The final score may say that it was an even match, but the shots show pure domination. Like Calgary Flames 2021-2022 SOG domination.
Чехи на Вас вся Россия смотрит и болеет! Разебите их!!!
Damn seems even better than McDavid
This is what these boys missed during covid. Holy mama fans showed up.
canada's goaltending looking like the oilers
Let’s gooooo Canada 🇨🇦
Will see you in Montreal buddy 😊❤️  Canadiens keep tanking 👍
Go Canada Go!
Mad props to the Slovak Goalie. That man should get drafted. .930 save percentage against Canada isn't something to be down about. That's a win in of itself.
Bedard is the next mcdavid potentially even Gretzky holy
Needs more Joe Bowen
Bedard got folded into 3 parts there at some point.
21 on Slovakia just being lazy on that last goal.
Словакия-молодцы.Очень перспективная команда в будущем
The fans got the money's worth and the emergency department at the hospital has near before had to deal with so many heart attack victims. Unbelievable game. The Slovaks played a helluva game.
If it wasnt for the Slovak goalie, the game would have been done at the end of the first period. Canada is far better then Slovakia, although they played very well, but also very dirty team. Tons of cross checks to Canadian players
РОСИИЯ🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺💪💪💪
The kid is good
Словаки монстры. Если бы не фолили жестко, победа за ними бы была
Bedard is a beast. Nemec cross checked him for virtually no reason and then he goes on to score one of the nastiest goals in OT. Good game tho Slovakia
Denis Godla rebirth?
anyone else hear the " THEYRE FKN SCARED" During the broadcast from the slovakia players on the ice after the 3rd tying goal? canada really was scared. props to slovak for a hard fought game
Vancouver Canucks better keep losing.
Bro how is bedard so good
Hope canada wins over usa big time
Please go to a team that’s never had a franchise player. He is going to turn around a franchise and I hope it’s someone like Arizona, Columbus, Ottawa.
This goal has Crosby's Golden Goal feel.... I know so much is different but that feeling it gave me when Bedard scored 😅 made me think about the 2010 Olympic Gold medal OT winning GOAL.  Both are goals Canadians will NEVER forget. This kid is something very special!! Great game boys... and a big 👏👏👏 to the Slovakia team.  No quit in those young men!! Let's GO get the US squad.... another impressive team and what a Semi finals we're in store for. 👍
Go Canada Go, we are proud of this team.
thats a hell of a winning goal
Wow that goal , Eberle’s and Mactavishs goal line save are top 3 Canadian plays of ALL TIME 🇨🇦👍🏻
Awesome to see Canada take the W., but they’re doing some awesome work in developing hockey players in Slovakia. Very impressive.   Note J. Slafkovsky is not on this team roster even though still within the age limit.   Would’ve making them that much better.  Imo
What’s an amazing goal, both teams played super well. Great job guys.
Shmell ya later slovakia
Haha after the Slovak scored and kissed the crowd and others were taunting the crowd haha shoulda been more humble that’s what happens when u do or say things u shouldn’t ! Like predicting a win ha Canada gets the last laugh 🇨🇦
Imagine to be so proud of a close loss to a last place team lmao Common canadian L. And there is also an interesting logic that the Slovaks played worse, but had a good goalkeeper; wow, let's subtract Bedard's attempts from all the shots on goal and see who's team is down to just one player?
You don’t blow a kiss to a Canadian crowd and expect to beat our team, dude gave his whole team bad ju ju after that.
people are saying Slovakia did good but they were EXTREMLY AGGRESIVE
53 saves....get that tendie some help
The on-ice cameramen are really irritating.
Slovakia well played well played that was a great goal by Bedard
That goal was insane.
A real shame poor reffing almost had a huge impact on this game. All the cross checking at the beginning of the game not getting called was terrible.
Just wow
Бедард однозначно и талант и звезда ! Не понимаю тех дебилов , кто восхваляет сб. Канады ! Без Бедарда Канада была бы в жопе .
It's Bedards' world. We're just living in it!
Hats of to Slovakia. I was scared a few times there in OT, hell of a game. 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Why are the championships always played in Canada? I would like to see them home in Bratislava, on Slovakia Greetings from Slovakia✌💥
That OT goal by Bedard was simply magical! What a talent!
I now officially hope the Habs and Panthers don't win another game all season.
What...a... Goal!!!!
Amazing performence Slovakia!
This was a game of hell But I live in canada
meh. Slovakia was the dirtiest team I've ever seen. and biggest soar losers I've ever seen; f em. they suk
Great game by Slovakia made them work for this win
That goal was DISGUSTINGLY beautiful it needs to be made into a GIF.
Без России это все равно недочемиионат!
засудили англосаксы  ,
What a sick game
the glove save by hinds was epic. Living every kids fantasy playing mini sticks on the cafeteria floor Haha
Connor. Bedard. The end.
WOW! That was a great goal, one of the greatest..."
Shout out to the Slovakian players who did their best to cross check the Canadian stars into a hospital bed, you suck!!!
Slovakia put up a real fight!  Respect from Finland
bedard is gonna need a week long shower for how filthy that OT goal was.
really annoys me to see people complaining abt the refs. did you guys not see the game? we got more PPs than they did..
9:31-9:55 The crowd goes wild! Excellent camera work though.
@TSN Yeah...the flags on the thumbnail are fine, but under them it says Finland vs Sweden.  Yesterday someone told me "I'm sad, my team is facing Canada and we're going to get destroyed". Well random youtube commentor, you can be very proud today and team Slovakia can leave the event with their heads up high 👏👏👏
That was the most tense game I have seen in a while, slovakia did a damn good job
insane that kid!
Hats off to Slovakia for learning to play the game the North American way.
Bédard is just better
9:10-9:30 Yo Toronto Maple Leafs. Are you paying attention to Connor Bedard right now? If not you should be. Did y'all see that movement? Clean game winning shot.
Wow 👏. What a nail-biter .
Connor "Freak Show" Bedard!
PLZ god of hockey let Connor Bedard play for the Habs!!! we NEED you man!!!
Slovakia played amazing but they deserved to get like 5 more penalties, also Canada could’ve scored about 5 more as well from hitting bar after bar
That ending goal was clutch AF!!
3v3 OT is far too nutty. Personally i think these playoff games should be 5v5 continuous OT like in the NHL playoffs but I’d settle for 20 minute 4v4 then shootout over this trash.
Talk about a goal that gives you the chills.  Ain't forgetting that anytime soon!
Good luck 🇨🇦 🍁
6:25 whattt
Overtime is played 3 vs 3 ? What is this ?
If you look close, you can see the 4 Czech jockstraps on the ice after Bedard's game winner.
Filip Mesar is going to be a special talent for the habs!
bedard is him
Lol.  Bedard sure hasn't hurt his draft position in this tournament.  It sure looked like he wanted to stick it to the Slovak team.
I don’t feel bad for nemec. Dirty all game and bites him in the end. Goalie played great though for sure. And the posts😉
Playing dirty against Canada doesn’t usually work. Canada dominated that game shouldn’t have been that close. Glad they won.
glad slovakia played well, congrats to Canada
Holy crap!!!!!!!!!  Amazing!
🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
What an overtime goal. Feel sad for Slovakia, such a good team but congrats Canada
what the fuck was Clark doing backchecking without his helmet on? everyone knows that’s a penalty😐
No RUSSIA, NO HOCKEY
Радуйся пока наших нет!
OVERTIME GOAL A BOBBY ORR CLASSIC.
Slovacs shoulda beat canada. So no chance for canada to repeat this yr
almost had a heart attack 12 times but it was worth seeing Bedard do Bedard things 🥹🥹🥹
Keep in mind Bedard is 17 years old… and wearing the fish bowl for a helmet.
Shame someone had to lose this one, the Slovaks played a fantastic game and tournament, I’m sure they’ll be back. The Americans on the other hand, I hope we slaughter them 💪🏻😅
Bedard is insane. ❤ but hats off to the other goalie. Stood on his head and made the biggest saves he could have made.
HAHA IN YOUR FACE SLOVAKIA!!! Canada is SO much better than you guys 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Imagine blowing a kiss to a Canadian crowd in the second period down by 1…
Well congrats to Canada it was unfortunate to see us lose but it was very entertaining match and I enjoyed it regardless
Slovakia sure likes to throw a lot of crosschecks
Canada pulled that win out of their ass!
Canadian here. Slovakia be proud. What a game.
Those idiots taunting every goal after being behind all game was some crap you do playing Rocket League. Not this...now cry in the locker room and dont make a mess
the mcdavid effect: check out that winning goal, everyone is caught just watching including his own teammates
Canada is Canada. They will always be the best team in the world with the best mentality. If someone had told me before the game that it would be decided in extra time, I wouldn't have believed them. As a Slovak, I expected us to lose at least 7:1. I'm sorry that we didn't keep the score 3:1 with Switzerland after the second period. We could play against Germany. It's a pity, see you in next year and I'm already looking forward to the next tournament.
Very impressed by Slovakia...they played thier hearts out and were physical..even if there were a few cheap shots in there. That goalie is unreal too. You could argue the bounces didn't really go Canada's way...they could have easily had 8 or 9 goals but hit alot of posts and were stonewalled a few times by a good goalie. As a Canadian I'm glad to see other teams are closing the talent  gap and there are more teams being competitive now in each group. Its good for Canada to be in these close ones.
I just heard about this game online so Im looking up the highlights and all I can say is wow. The intensity had me out of my seat. This is what good ole hockey rivalries like Detroit vs Colorado use to feel like. This is also the most dominant perforce from a kid I have ever seen. Connor is gonna be a game changer in the NHL a la McJesus.
Man Bedard, if he didn't score the GWG there, woulda been the villain
но кофициент 1,05 этот матч не стоит
Победища🤣🤣🤣куда идёт хоккэй,да вообщем и мир.Слабейший чемпик.
We’re watching the next big talent to ever touch the ice.
With over 50 shots, I’m surprised that the Slovak goalie kept his save percentage over .900 that’s just insane to me
Словакия крутая
NHL 23 style goal.
I enjoyed the slovak tears after taunting the crowd with each goal. run home now children
For Slovakia to win tonight, they needed to execute their game plan flawlessly, and they needed a metric crap-ton of luck. Both things happened, and they came closer to beating Canada than a Slovakian U20 team has ever come. They poured everything they had into that game and it was almost enough. They are due major props here. Also, note that this isn't the Canada team that was just starting out the tournament, and not clicking together so well yet, with line combinations yet to be figured out, etc. (i.e. the team their Czech brethren managed to beat). This was Canada playing at their best. And you could see the frustration on the faces of the Canadian players. Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard, and Slovakia was putting in the work (while Canada was working hard, they weren't necessarily working SMART, wasting quite a few OZ possessions on low-percentage plays). It finally took both hard work AND talent to win the game though, with Bedard putting the team on his back and ending it in one of the most amazing ways possible. This is almost better than Mason McTavish sweeping the puck out of the air, saving a sure Finnish OT winner in the gold medal game this past summer. Almost.  Anyway, congrats to the nation of Slovakia! Your hockey players made millions of Canadians extremely nervous tonight, and normally, only 4 nations are able to pull that off (USA, Finland, Sweden and Russia). Also, remember to look on the bright side - just eight players (Patrik Andrisík, Róbert Bačo, Šimon Bečár, Pavol Funtek, Šimon Groch, Matej Marinov, Libor Nemec and Marcel Štefančík) are ineligible to return for the 2024 tournament. So provided their NHL teams don't hold them out, 14 players (including the goalie who played the game of his life, Adam Gajan, and also tournament standouts Dalibor Dvorský, Filip Mešár, Šimon Nemec, Servác Petrovský and Adam Sýkora) could be coming back to try and slay the giants of the hockey world once more.
Think that’s the first time I’ve seen him celly or show emotion after a goal all tourney
Respect to Slovakia. What a game.
A lesson to Slovakia...Don't poke the Bedard!!!
Beddard is him
Holy Toledo!
Словакия на ЧМ играет лучше немецкой команды.
Is it safe to say that's one of the best world junior games in Canadian history? Certainly on of the best I've ever seen
Bedard is going to be more like Crosby than McDavid with an Ovechkin one-timer
Wildest game
Beautiful goal 🎉🎉 go Canada go
When I was growing up he was called a ball hog.
Slovaks are very undisciplined.
Mike Johnson is very annoying.
Fans certainly got their money’s worth in this one.   Plenty of drama right to the end.  Slovak goalie was outstanding  facing 56 shots!? Having Bedard on the ice  for 3 on 3  was just too much though , and he ended it just exactly how you would expect - like a stud.
Mad respect to Slovakia, what a game they played! Their goaler was on fire! Mesar is awesome to see as a Habs fan. I wonder if with Slakovsky they would have won this game..! But Bedard is just scary to watch! Every team should start scoring into their own net to lose every game just to have better chances at getting him!!
Bedard is an absolute magician dekeing three player to win the game in OT just class 🤙🏻
Dirty game in my opinion the refs needed to call more
Slovakia gave Canada all they had, even though it wasn't enough, it was a great effort by Slovakia. USA vs Canada is going to be a excellent semifinal game! Both teams are elite.
What an insane game! Hats off to goalies, and the last goal was insane
dear TSN, the thumbnail for this video is extremely confusing  edit: fixed
Hawks fans are drooling
The stop with the hand by the canadian defenseman should have triggered a penalty shot.
Slováci vyjebaní,sem rád že zase jedou domů. Thank you Canada
Felt bad for the Slovaks, they played a HELL of a game.
30 seconds in … where the f did buddy in the all white camera suite come from lol?  Crazy
2023 World Junior Canada games be like "let's just show you another Bedard highlight reel".
Can you guys please post the full overtime? It was crazy.
After Bedard's performance I now expect 32 NHL teams to tank.
Slovakia was really great there, what a game. Ending for Bedard was storybook.
Slovakia played a dirty game. No sportsmanship. And the ref were blind. A clean win for Team Canada.
That goalie deserved a win.
After the goalie carried the team to OT, Stripes not calling anything, Canada not winning face-offs and Canada not playing at their 100% . . . I have no clue how Slovakia managed to lose. (I do know actually, Connor Bedard. that's how). As a Canadian props to the Slovakian goalie.
Bedard is a cheat code. Kudos to Gajan, what a performance as well.
Congratulations to Slovakia for taking Canada to overtime. I would also like to thank you for putting a reality scare into the Canadian team.
doesn't mean shit with the Russians not there
That Bedard is good at the ice/puck thing. (Terrifying to think how close 🇨🇦 was to getting goalied)  Helluva game!!!
That second goal from SVK was a really strong Play.
Crazy goal by bedard, but holy shit did the goaltending for slovakia look stellar. He alone definitely deserved this win even if his defense played awful.
Now that overtime winner was a Bedard pulling a McDavid deking through everybody that was so sweet
Montreal needs to tank to last place to get a chance at getting Bedard.
Kkkanada sucks, except for 1 player.
As a Canadian, hats off to Slovakia, y'all didn't go down without a fight and almost came out with a win too. GG's!
That was a McDavid goal....soon to be known as a Bedard goal....lol.
Connor with the Patty Kane celly lets go
Wow!
Thumbnail says Finland vs Sweden under the flag images.
The amount of missed defensive assignments is shocking. Get better canada
slovakia deserved to lose. dirty ass players lmao.
Hold your heads high Slovakia! Even as a Canadian I’m truly proud of your team!
Amazing game. Can't wait to watch Bedard in the NHL
Канада в роде целится на второе золото подряд, но это ещё не финал. А так конечно Канада крепко смотрятся
That Slovakian goalie is the true MVP
Conner Bedard is an alien 👽
Just a little bit too Slow akia!
Are you serious with that OT goal?  Who is this kid?
its great canada has the bedard storyline to distract themselves, otherwise they would still be in shock how close this became to one of the greatest home soil hockey flops in canadian history. with the, "this is the greatest WJC team in canadian history".
Slovakia did not back down. One of the best back and forth games.of hockey I've ever seen in my life and the goaltending? Lmao fucking insane
Connor Bedard may be the best player to ever play in the IIHF World Junior's.
thumbnail says team Sweden lol
That OT goal was FRCKED
Our guys gave an incredible superhuman performance, for which I admire them very much. When they come back to Slovakia, they must be welcomed at the airport and shown that they have nothing to be ashamed of. But I will not forgive one note, and that is Connor Bedard. What this guy performed on and off the ice, to me he is just an ordinary conceited arrogant son of a bitch, for which he deserves to get such a hit that it will be difficult to get off the ice. I wish him well in the NHL and they will take care of him there.
One of the craziest and dramatic overtime, I ever seen when Connor Bedard finishes them off. Slovakia played great.
Ottawa please fucking tank! I don’t care about playoffs. I want this kid!
Man that goalie played unreal for slovakia. A lot of bad luck for Canada for sure, but 57 shots and only 4 goals…
Halifax is an electric crowd one of the best Canadian crowds
Slovakia gets the award for most left woke team, Gotta love that all out crying, your 18 years old man, what a bunch of pussies. No wonders shit is happening over in Europe
Bedard just deked the entire population of Slovakia on that OT goal. Absolute pure filth.
As soon as I saw the video was 11 minutes long I got a little nervous. More drama than I cared to endure for a quarterfinal but what a finish.
Slovakias Goalie was fantastic! Someone draft that kid!!
CAN is below top 4 team without Bedard
Bedard is once in a generation…awful giveaway by the Slovak player to him also
Since when does Canada where black? White or RED is Canada!
Slovakia played awesome. What a game !
CONOR BEDARD IS INSANE !!!!!!! GO CANADA GO 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
ALL HAIL CONNOR BEDARD !
Bedard owns Slovakia
Slovakia was better and deserves to play in the semi-finals more than Canada. Don't be upset Slovaks, better watch the NHL how Alex Ovechkin will cut Gretzky's record
jesus
What an epic goal by Bedard! Up there in Canadian / World Junior hockey lore with Eberle's game-tying, tournament-saving goal in the last 5 seconds of the SF vs Russia in 2008-09.
6:22 Save of The Game
I feel bad that Canada has to lose to USA now
TSN, What took you so long? Wooo
What a beast of a game. Nail bitter to the best goal of the competition.
Bedard vs Mcdavid is going to be must see TV for the next 15 years
Great game!
KARMA 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
One, two, three, triple deke
bruh what a goal from bedard to finish an amazing game!
someone should have leveled nemecs and put him back in his place.
as a canadian, massive hats off to the slovakian goalie, man saved so much shots!
Hats off to this Slovakian team. They played with the heart of Lions. That game was anyone's to win. The Slovak team deserves a medal for their gallantry alone. What a great bunch of young men on that Slovak team.
Unbelievable game
Очень красивая победа канадской сборной. Словаки молодцы, но не повезло. Теперь Канаде предстоит играть в полуфинале с очень сильной командой из США. Будет рубка.... посмотрим
Connor Bedard is a cheat code. Canada needs to be better on the back end if they want to beat the US.  That being said, what a CLASSIC. LET'S GO CANADA!!! Being in that building was UNREAL!
*Habs To-Do List* 1.  Tank hard for Bedard. 2.  Draft Gajan with a late-round pick.
That Connor Bedard goal will live on forever especially if Canada can win the Gold. Shoutout to Slovakia though you guys played a hell of a game Gajan is just incredible
As a Canadian I actually started to quietly root for Slovakia near the end of this game. They played with so much heart and passion, I actually kinda felt sad when they lost. I love seeing more physical and chippy play in the world juniors. Incredible game from both teams. Really exited to see Slovakia grow as a hockey country. They were painfully unlucky to run into Canada in the first round.
Slovaks did all they could, but nothing is stopping Bedard.
Slovak goalie played insane props to him.
Hell of a game!
I teared up. What a game!
Slovakia was so pathetic
Kissing to the crowd before you’ve won the game is not smart. Hopefully he knows that now on the flight home.
It wasn't Bedard's best game, they were on him all the time and got crosschecked a lot but there was a feeling that he wanted to make them pay at some point for that. On the way to all time WJC points record.
Atmosphere was insane
Hats off to the 4 goalies for Slovakia.played a hell of a game.
The heartbreaker celebration topped it off after the kissing to the crowd. Such a sweet ending.
Who is Hard for Bedard!?
I cant for the life of me figure out why our coach was picked for this team. He was out coached again but thankfully we still won. Bedard needs to be on his offside during a PP... We need to work on our faceoffs and someone remind Clarke hes a D not a forward.
Love you Canada
You gotta feel for the Slovakian goalie for saving more then 50 shots!
Man, it's surreal watching Bedard! Go Canada!
Conner Bedard at it again!🎉
One of the all-time World Junior classic games
Pray for damar Hamlin
W
What a game. Slovakia played like Lions. Canada has gotta be careful for the next games.
baedard
Kids got game
Bedard can have my kids
First
The reasons Canada didn't defeat Slovakia by 5 goals plus are:  1. The Slovakia goalie made some spectacular saves & also luck was on his side. 2. Canada failed to score on countless grade A chances — hitting the goal post seven times &  the crossbar twice. 3. Slovakia won critical faceoffs that led to them scoring clutch goals at PIVOTAL points in the game. 4. Canada depended too much on Bedard to save the day (And He Did) when Slovakia responded with a goal...Other Team Canada players need to step up...  That Goal in Overtime by Bedard will be Iconic forever... Skated around all 3 Slovakia players & undressed their goalie leaving his jock strap in the stands!! 🇨🇦🏒👀
