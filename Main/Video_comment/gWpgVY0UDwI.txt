I m gona 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I'll take egg whites over poop water
No way! There’s such a thing as vegetarian alcohol? 😟
Egg white to make foam right?  Hah, EZ
People like this guy and Guga.that use this fake asmr voice make me want to vomit and go on a deleting people spree.
Don't use the water of chickpeas, please. 😮 Soaking chickpeas, or any legumes, in water is a method to make them easier on our digestive system and to remove phytic acid.  The water may not kill you but it's not exactly healthy either...
I don't get why. Just for foam? My whiskey doesn't need to be foamy or thick with the taste of egg white
But I really like next one 😊
Bro if you known the depressing video I just wanted befor this one your voice would not be so cheerful
Bro I hate egg white I am sorry
I don’t want to tell you how to do your job, you’re clearly better at it than I am or ever will be, but so help me god if I ever ask for a drink and a bartender assumes I want eggs or beans in it, I’m jumping over the bar and forcing him to eat his entire stash of eggs.
What tool did he use on the egg?
I don't agree that dry shaking is necessary, just shake the cocktail properly and it'll come out the same
Chick pea water? 😮
You should try brothers bond bourbon
You can't taste the egg white
Imagine drinking one of these cocktails with aquafaba while having a chickpea allergy
It's not that they don't like the taste of raw egg white, it's that they A) mistakenly believe you can get salmonella from raw egg B) don't understand that, even if you could, shaking it around with ice and alcohol most definitely absolutely slaughters any bacteria in it
I like how the title cut off to “Why bartenders put egg whites in cock…”
People drink something as disqusting as alcohol, and egg whites is where some of them draw the line? 💀💀💀
Pro tip - Try wet shake then dry shake. It makes a very smooth foam.
Making a bottle of whey and using about 30ml of it also works great.
Imagine compromising flavor for some foam
Too bad if they don't like egg whites. They are getting what I have.
And you can print on them 🙌🏽
I mean if you don’t like a cocktail with an egg white in it. Try a different cocktail. There’s like a billion. Don’t pretend ur stuck for choice
He did not do the shake stare
Aqua fava=bean water
The Waffle House has found it's new host.
The Waffle House has found its new host
Isn't drinking raw egg one of the best ways to get salmonella,lol? So the chickpeas water might be better if you don't mind egg's taste
you didn't shake it hard enough
Goya Jumpscare
who the fuck would rather have chickpea water in their drink instead of raw egg white
you can barely taste the egg whites in whiskey sour anyway. the whiskey, lemon and simple syrup actually mask the taste.
I’ll take neither 💯
Never been drunk ever..never had alcohol too..i wonder how does these actually tastes like?
Fun fact: The german name for that egg cracking tool is Eierschalensollbruchstellenverursacher.
Both of these recipes sound disgusting and one looks like SALMONELLA
We can use it for piscosour too
What was the tool you used to break the egg in the beginning?
If someone served me bean water it would be on sight dude
I was always taught a whiskey sour with egg white is a Boston sour
This is really helpful
No thanks
Which drink is made with which foam at the end? Seems to be a difference in colour as well as texture
sooooo, y’all mfs makin drinks out of bean juice?
raw egg white makes your hairline go brr!
Ukrainiec
Make some hummus out of the chick peas, it's super easy!
The juice those beans come in is absolutely disgusting...please never put that in my drink
Isnt drinking raw eggs a little bit of roulete because they can have salmonela in them?
Grandpa Simpson approves
Uuuuum, ew?
ew
If you do that in a restaurant or a bar setting you need to use pasteurize eggs which could be tough to get your hands on. Otherwise it’s a no-no with the health department
Leftover egg yolks?  Make a Porto Flip!
This guy inspired me to be a bartender.
How many times have you said  "cocktail" in your life
I find it funny that the Ukrainian bartender has 2 American flag shakers
Thank you for teaching me this. I fucking hate eggwhites in drinks. So learning this changedcmy life
Chickpea water makes bubbles but does NOT make it smooth. It looks visually okay but it's not the same at all
Sick video!!! I love the egg white drinks Vlad!
Aquafaba is such a wild substance
This is probably smarter for certain countries too, and people vulnerable to salmonella. Since not all countries are required to vaccinated chickens against salmonella (eg. America) I would avoid eating raw egg in some places. This still mostly applies to people vulnerable to Salmonella (eg. Elderly or immuno compromised). Eggs in the UK however are much safer, due to a big scare in the 80s the British lion scheme came out and it’s drastically reduced salmonella in eggs, to the point where it’s now ok for vulnerable groups to eat runny or raw eggs with the British lion stamp.
Hmmm
Me : not knowing what a dry shake is... Pretty wet to me
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮

Those flag shakers are awesome usa baby lol
👩🏻♠️👩🏾‍🦲👒😗😺✊
А когда у нас джин физз с белком начал делаться?
Do you know dylan
Oh he said chickpeas are cooked in and not pooped in…. My ears are great ig🥹🫠😂
Any connaisseur would make a pisco sour, not a whisky sour
y’all want egg whites or bean water
Love the merica shakers
The sound of ice is just 😌
Let us repent from our sins and accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior one day we will face him and those who doesn't repent from there sins and didn't accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior would be sent to hell for he didn't want God so he will go to place where God is nowhere to be found but the good news is this Jesus has already died for you so you don't have to suffer hell  all you need to do is accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent from your sins you will be saved that Is the good news my friends that salvation is free thats all ask me if your confused at something God bless you,
The aquafaba looks horrible
Where did you get your shakers
Wow! Aquafaba jumping in the cocktail world. That's great!!
I wonder who woke up one day and decided to mix egg white and whiskey
Vegan too 🤩👍💝
A whiskey sour with egg whites is my favorite cocktail. If I found out the bartender used bean juice I would barf.  Note: I only order it if I think the bartender has the time and ingredients handy, and I tip generously having worked in restaurants;-)
Looks yukies
Damn I’ve never had that nice of a whiskey sour
I fuckin cocktails with egg. Its like drinking raw egg gross. That smell
Nice looking shakers (I guess that's what their called)
That's some nice grasses
I just like it when you day Aquafaba
Why the fuck do eggs have to be put in alcohol? What is with the world's obsession with eggs?
ATOMIC GIN FIZZ
I just keep watching to see that egg cracking tool lol
you can even use this to make whipped cream in case you were wondering, as most reasonable people do upon discovery of any liquid
Don't like egg whites? How about don't like salmonella?
never gonna be needing this info nor be wanting to drink that, yet your videos are damn interesting
This is so cringe
i recently learned u can put egg whites in cocktails, can't wait to taste one 🏃 thanks sleepy barmaid
I can smell this video
i love your texas uncle shakers!!
*sees American drink shaker* *DUNDUDUNDUN* 🇺🇸🦅🍔🍕🌭👨‍🌾
I think I’d rather the egg white….
I long wondered if the alcohol content in something like a sour or Fizz is high enough to negate any chance of food poisoning from the egg.
And you can make hummus with the leftover chick peas, right?
Apparently I never had a real whiskey sour I just did whiskey and sour mix with ice and shook
This guy is a legit bartender unlike Tipsy Bartender. Idl why yt keeps recommending that guy to me.
Please tell us what that egg tool is and maybe where to get it?
I've also heard of whey being used in place of an egg white
Raw egg whites? Technically, I have a chance contracting salmonella from my drink?
Aquafaba tastes so much worse. So much worse. It's intolerable. I can't believe people prefer it over egg whites.
Boycott Goya
Am I the only one who finds eggs absolutely disgusting, especially raw eggs?
Make a viagra cocktail 😉
I love ur channel!!!
I have a feeling that it's much easier to taste chickpea water than egg whites in a drink, lol. I guess that's what you get if you're a picky drinker. I can understand if you're vegan, but, otherwise, there's no reason for the replacement.
Why this ugly American flag?
Wait isnt raw egg like super bad for you?
At the end which one is which?
Last year this disgusted me, then I learned that US eggs are pasteurized and are technically safe to eat raw. Safe as in you won’t get salmonella. It likely won’t agree with your stomach though
Raw egg white (or yolk) can bring salmonella to your table. Only way to not risk is to buy pasteurised egg white.
Aquafaba=bean water
Legend 🖤🖤🖤
Whiskey Sour without Egg white feels absolutely shit
A few years ago I went to a bar. I don’t do well with beer and they had no wine, so I risked it with a cocktail. I asked for a whiskey sour because they sounded good. I hate egg and saw that some recipes called for egg whites. So I asked the bartender how he prepared it and I mentioned the egg. He said “this isn’t River North, no egg”. I said that was perfectly fine and then proceeded to drink the most amazing cocktail I’ve ever tried. So much so, whiskey sour is now my favorite cocktail.
I'm a kid but these videos are still entertaining
I used to drink whiskey sours on the regular. I’ve never had it like this before. They were always served in a clear glass with lots of ice. It didn’t look too much different than whiskey.😳
Doubt you're going to read this but use farm fresh eggs! They're less likely to contain salmonella
Are you Russian or do you have Russian heratige
Pineapple juice works as well if it’s shaken hard enough
I laugh in salmonella
Me : a muslim  BUT I CAN'T STOP WATCHING THESE VIDEOS
I’m 16 right now but when I turn 21 I can’t imagine going to a bar and being like… hey could you replace the egg whites so I don’t die because of my egg allergy
Did you ever get drunk
Not a fan of whiskey but these videos satisfy me so much
Your voice is why I come here😌
Gross
Nop rather have an egg
I would love to try one when im 21 but like im allergic to eggs so id have to go with chickpeas lol
I hate how much ice you put in. If I go to a bar I'm going to get drunk not  drink an ounce of liquid in a full cup with ice. College mindset I guess but still
I'll be recovering alcoholic you shouldn't make these type of videos
In my country, we have a drink called STMJ. It's basically made from milk, raw egg, honey, and ginger. They usually served hot like tema. When hot, the egg taste like cream, but when the drink is cold, you dan smell the smell of the egg.
It also sounds really good for people with egg allergies
I don't drink and don't ever plan to drink but u legit took egg whites which is absolutely rancid and replaced it with something that's even more rancid
There is simply no substitute for egg white… only if it’s a shit bar
Why am I watching dis guy? I don't make drinks nor have I got the age to even drink
Fucking bullshit lmao egg whites hell no that's why I don't go to bars.are you trying to be the next Gordon Ramsay of alcohol.i hate drinking poison dam near killed me
Really really gross.
I just watched another one of your vids, subbed right away. Nice videos!
Egg whites are nasty
Agg
Those cups look cool
Nothing you tell me is going to convince me to put bean juice in my whiskey.
I know it isnt but This feels so petty like, " i don't want egg whites in my drink"  " Fine, now you will get the chickpea juice "
how are y’all gonna day aquafaba is gross when you’d literally drink raw chicken period
🤮
I like the shaker bottles bro
Sounds awful, but I'd try it.
That is incredibly weird.
Wut are chickpeas
Ok, what was that tool you used to crack the egg?
im a muslim but these videos are so cool
I love making cocktail it’s like cooking or sciences it’s so much fun !
When I start drinking I could have a way to have whiskey sour without egg whites cuz I have an intolerance for eggs
I always order whiskey sour in every bar I've ever been in at least once n have never got one with egg whites.. huh wonder why
It's not a joke it's a hazard
important to mention that you should use eggs that were desinfected with UV or washed with proper detergent and sanitizer.
You can use dehydrated egg white, is what works for me te best
I just want a sprite man
Sorcery
so I'm not the only one who drinks chickpea sauce
Changing egg whites for aquafaba should be illegal🤢🤮
This man makes me wanna work as a bar tender.
Bean juice
He is pretty good with his hands 🤣
I like the USA cups bro
goya tho 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
1st: Ewwww. 2nd: Stay halal bro.
it makes u fart just as much.
I wouldn't mind drinking something with raw egg whites in it, it's not like I have an allergy to it.  In many Japanese dishes they use raw eggs all the time though they also keep their chicken coops and generally everything as sanitary as possible with proper upkeeping so there's not a fair comparison.
But he didn't say why bartenders to it lol
Aquafaba changes the taste more than than egg whites
I see you dry shake one handed. I too, like to live dangerously.
That’s even more disgusting
Go Goya!
Drink a swig of vodka out of the bottle like an adult
Ew
I want one
Never shake twords the customer, that glass can go flying and that drink will spill onto them, not worth the risk
I so love your voice
I'm not allowed to try these But it's satisfying when you make and talk about it
Great editing and prestigious voice over. 👍
Wait did I miss the part where he actually explained why?
We use the product called “foamee” which is made from 100% chickpea. It’s easy to use as it’s packaged in a little bottle with a dropper. We use this for our whiskey sours and literally nobody knows the difference (we want our cocktails to be vegan friendly so no egg whites)
So let me get some bartender back in the day was like making an omelet and like drinking at 6:00 a.m. and came up with this?
Glad I don’t drink anything with the name cock or tail in it lol the white foam came stay over there 😂
We always used egg whites because they were seperated from the yolks we use for aiolis and hollandaise. Plus we didn't have any menu items that used chickpeas.
This Guy: On My Recommendation And Making Cocktails 15 Years Old Me: Hmmmmm, Intresting
Nice to see noroi products on YouTube. Didn't know they exported
Aquafaboir or however you spell it tastes like the devils piss
Pisco sour babyyyy
bro!!! I don't even drink BUT why I can't stop watching 😂
I thought you were foreign until I saw those shaker cups
I don't drink. Why am I watching this
Is it just me or your wondering what was that thing he used to crack the egg
Ive seen this same video FAR TOO MANY TIMES
I- 😀 egg whites-? Is salmonella not a thing anymore?
Couldn't use xanthan gum mixed with water because it thickens the water and in a lot of vegan recipes they use it to replace egg whites
What is that thing he's using to crack the egg with ????
Egg whites have a taste?
This is not halal mode
Those shaking cups look dope
Did he just use an Eierschalensollbruchstellenverursacher? yes, German is .... Uhm... German!
Who tf actually thought raw eggs in a drink would taste good
Sounds like salmonella.
Im 16 (and dont drink 💀) but for some reason i rlly like watching this guy's videos
I didint know that america also hast an Eierschalensollbruchstellenverursacher
Yo compared to most bartenders I've seen on yt you definitely seem to know what you're doing but 2 tbs is way to much aqua faba. You can use half that, it has too much flavour to add more than that.
Why would you drink fckin eggwhite
Salmonella
Too easy
Not Aquafoba sounding and looking like Aqua Tofana 💀💀💀
I don't drink cuz I'm muslim but watching this kind of video was so entertaining. Glad YouTube put your video on recommendation
I'm not even 21 and I still love these videos
You can't drink in my religion but I somehow find your content very interesting even tho I don't understand 😂😂😅
It doesn't provide the same mouth feel and body you get from egg. Also you have to shake the bean juice to the max to even get any sort of result.
This is so entertaining
What is that device he used to punch a hole in that egg?
Why is your voice so sexy!
As someone who's allergic to chickpeas, thank you so much for this info! Now I know to ask if egg whites are not mentioned in the menu
You just need Stilabunt
I thought you're not supposed to use the juice from the can but rather the cooking water
This is also a good tip for those who have allergies to the egg whites
If you gotta drink this...You're an alcoholic.
You can also whip it up to make a vegan meringue. One of my chefs did that when I was in culinary school. It was really cool.
Yeah I only order whiskey sour, I've never got an egg..in 4 countries .... so idk
Ew
Not the whiskey sour you would find in Wisconsin, probably the state with the biggest per capita consumption of alcohol.
Ahhh garbanzos goya, un clásico en RD
If you can’t drink your spirits neat, just don’t do it. Cocktails are for pussies
If you don't store your beans upside down, you don't want the best that liquid has to offer
I’ve seen the beans juice before but to anyone who is, especially vegans, using it, make sure to use unsalted beans.
can you really taste the egg white though? with the sugar, citrus and spirit, the egg white tastes like meringue, not like raw egg white.
This is like vegetarians and vegans, why would you need fake meat or in this case fake egg if you don't like egg what's the point. It's like saying I like to eat strawberries but I don't like them. It doesn't make sense
But why????
OMG that egg sucker thingy
I don't drink that often and rarely make my own drinks, but I find myself watching these videos because I like your voice. 🤷🏾‍♀️
This doggy sounds like guda foods
Chick peas are a real thing?? I thought it was a cute nickname for your dog or sumthin 🤣
Gin fizz… why did I hear jizz fizz
Thats why I dont go to bars....
How is chickpea water more gross than a chickens period?   It isn't
Disgusting
🤮
Goya tiene que ser bueno
Don't like egg whites? Drink bean juice!
What is this? Mediterranean breakfast
Nice
Can you get aquafaba without buying chickpeas?
like the cups
And this deserves and subscribe
Early check
Im not a drinkin man, but i respect your talent, and skill.
Hearing this almost made me cry
Egg whites can carry Salmonella. I got Salmonella from bad milk. I was 6 feet tall and 205 pounds. After 3 days of vomiting, diarrhea and fever my drugs won out! After 3 days I was 191 pounds! I couldn't work for 6 days. Be careful!
This nigga drinkin beans
Most bartenders don’t even know what a whiskey highball is.
Tf?? I can’t imagine drinking anything else but whisky straight from the bottle. That looks like baby puke
Nasty just nasty. U doing all that for a drink when u could just smoke some weed
Bean water? Nasty
Look Goya what I use
Gross.
& it’s vegan too
become muslims people its the true religion and drinking is prohibited
GO VEGAN!
I don't drink, this is not for me!
What about salmonella?
I actually do like it with egg white but I definitely want to try this
You can also use pure egg white powder and a little water. Its completely safe but it does have quite as much foam as a fresh egg.
They put in eggs to inseminate God
Yo this is actually TRENDING
Man i hate this stuff in bars, putting god damn eggs in my whiskeys
Q nojo
Japanese: eat raw egg Murica: we don't eat raw  egg, we drink it.
I’m not drinking bean water or raw eggs 😂
Who tf drinks sht like that?
If I asked for a whiskey sour, and you handed me something fluffy or foaming, I'm leaving.
My favorite drink right now is a whiskey sour made with Buffalo Trace. Good stuff and doesn’t isn’t too expensive for a college student to enjoy
Well I can't eat raw egg so I'm glad there's a substitute ^^
For how long you need to shake drinks with egg white? I saw so many different opinions and one even stated 25 minutes which is bit excesive i think
Agua fava is disgusting, gives you gas, and tastes way worse than egg
Don't pound on your shaker if one side is glass. Good way to break it.
Yay! Love aquafaba! Use it in almost all my baking cookies, icing, buttercreams, sponge cakes, meringues, French macarons.. etc.. so many great uses and much better than nasty egg whites!
This dudes voice is so soothing man
You should try reducing it
I swear all because I told my friend I might be going to work as a bartender for a bit this channel is in my recommended…
What’s the difference between a chickpea and a garbanzo bean?     I’ve never had a garbanzo bean on my face.
I don't even drink alcohol, I just found myself subscribed to this man 😂👌
Aside from taste, in some countries it's not safe to eat raw eggs, for example here in Germany, about 1/3 of all food poisoning through salmonella is caused by raw eggs.
Step out of your comfort zone add different food to your diet
Eew, I'd rather drink egg whites lol
Or just use some xanthan gum 🤷🏻‍♂️
Egg whites are better for you
I've never had a whiskey sour...
I have no interest in cocktails, but these videos are just so suave 👌
Using egg whites is a one way trip to salmonella city
I’m gonna fucking barf 🤢
Oh damn....
a reverse dry shake would have been more effective in terms of foam and texture
you NEED to get chickpeas that say no salt!! otherwise you'll taste it  how to drink has made a video on egg white replacements, worth a watch
Do you taste the chickpea water in the cocktail?
Aquafaba almost no foam, would increase it
I've ordered multiple whiskey sours and they never put eggs in it. Thank God for being down south 🙏🏾
No no no, burrata ”water”
Yeah u know... I think I will just use pasta water, I feel like that's the least disgusting out of the three
Vegans in frenesi
I want those shakers 🍸
i don't drink, so i don't know. are whiskey sours actually sour?
Love those shakers
cool facts and tricks for impressing people
Still freaking love egg white in whiskey sour 😋
Wow peas
