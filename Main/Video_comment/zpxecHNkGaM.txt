rap is preventing harm and digesting frustration. the songs of realness cary through generations, anders God gives the day, the devil guards misinfluence . be honest and God gives you a story.
you are nothing without dayones, thats why i say, where would i be without my day ones. celebration. not with a faul focus that it needs to be celebrated because lost them

Y'all young niggas better quick dissin the dead
Even if they are gone they shall live eternity only in the chosen few selects 🖤👌✔️
Dissing the dead means writing your own rules and killing innocent children. There’s much going into this phrase that our culture is NOT educated on !! The cleansing has begun and I fear the wrath poured from Jehovah!
Daily Banger in my Rotation!

Compare this to a vid from 12 years ago. Flow can change but voice going more deep and accent shouldn’t change. Man the industry as “Illuminati” or “music company records” really got Gucci cloned. Y’all fans that has been here for over 15 years with Gucci, how could y’all not tell but I’m not even a fan and I can tell easily Gucci got cloned. Where is the real Gucci with tattoos everywhere, and gold teeth? With a higher pitch voice and a different accent from 12 years ago?
bums...
its too late it is what it is
on the wizard i gave the graftul dead property a stone from the prophets sons. and wont put it on display. where did they bury the dead man i found with a 40.
Curios cause the dead don't hear me though
Long live GUCCI

Look god is whit us now everytime !
Gucci is an old school rapper but rap like he in his prime 💪🏾
I’m proud of u Gucci
bro that chain is something else boy.
Damn Gucci went in on this and I ain't even a Gucci fan but Gucci bodied this track .
Time to diss the dead: too many people think that “the money makes the man” purely lame. Cause it didn’t work for Tupac vs real guy with stripes earned and thinks being wealthy will save him from gang politics. Busts back after coward jumping is respected. Another stripe earned as black belt style. Indians in battles had scalps they took tied to their weapons as their stripes earned. Money will never make the man, you’ll be cut off in the road fostech 12 fired at all limbs if you think so. Shotguns with magazines. Stood over another 20 to jaw. Fuck a dental record niggas  And I’m the main event,  Hop out the range with tints - there he is 💥💥💥💥💥💥
You just kill thugger 😂
They hurt me bc that's how they were brought up. They got set straight and now those that say they love me hurt me just the same. If you can't coexist, you hit. If you up yet betray me, you damn yourself and I will not get you out
Fuck the maturity fuck the rest if they mad say sum
Gucci Gucci Gucci please all day every day
Gucci two times the realest and only trap god ever
Gucci the realest mf out here fuck the rest
Rip... ggg
MERCI 🙏

Gc 💘
I’ll tell you one thing though no White Guilt here. I’m Gucci man’s exact age and I wish the CIA would’ve gave my people some narcotics to sell and moved us into the inner city Instead we got took out the inner-city and shoved in rual  trailer parks that were so depressing we did opiates until  we killed ourselves but not before we idolized dudes like this and made them rich
NOBODY MORE CONSISTANT THEN GUCCI MANE STRAIGHTUP OR YOUNG DOLPH BACK TO BACK AND KEY GLOCK 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶📽BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Gucci may n it down
No cap 🧢 they betta stop gucci trying save theses niggas from loosing they life playing with him

Those America's Cup high tops he's wearing at the beginning are mega comfortable, overpriced cause its Prada, but super nice kicks.

Did Gucci mane shoot one of his clones or something 🤣🤣
Why he feel like he started the trend?
Shooting like “the baby” they break in my home
Ever diss my brother Dolph you disowned forever 💯 🤧
👍✊
I still think he should be bigger and more played than he is
It's sad people have to find out they're mortal when they diss the passed, then someone disses that person and the cycle continues.
Very True
🔥❤‍🔥
Goat shidddd 💯
I’m all for the positivity but why he didn’t feel like this at the versus against Jeezy ??? 🧏🏽‍♂️
That can't be real gold his neck would be broken, if it is real that's atleast 800 troy ounces
Gucci getting wiser
These artist don’t know disrespect the dead and you become they’re slave in the afterlife they get there get back
GUCCI
this song is riding shaman spells with speed heed the dead shot in the bed dead sample pampers
Ghetto Mafia was the first rappers I heard to diss the dead on that song "We On The Grind" way back in the 90s when they dissed nate but Gucci took it to another level....
Gucci mane is a hustler, you gotta remember he's from the streets. Gucci is a hustler to me. He's very big on putting ppl on.
on this halloween, i will listen to this masterpiece 💥🫡
https://youtu.be/ppxUaHwjx84
You have to listen to Gucci songs twice fa it to hit harder in ready to scroll reply and he ain't done 😱🤯
He should be very careful with how he talk and what he do to people
Huge respect for Gucci. Still walking over these beats like he still in his prime

Foul ass wash 911
Dissing the dead is kinda pretend though. Like.. you’re pretending it would have an affect on that person, and showing religious symbols and whatever. That’s like essence of make believe. Shit’s wack. The industry needs less of this, not more.
so yea i agree with this song message
someone shot me in the face while i was getting a sixx pack of beer in a liquor store in rockford killinois
Blac Youngsta dissing Dolph made Gucci done wit this shit 🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Yo Gucci is lit he's still on point his new 1017 gang has him feelin like he's a youngin again lol
MORE RAPPERS NEED TO JOIN THIS BROTHER AND CLEAN UP THIS MENTAL DESTRUCTION THAT HAS POLLUTED THE MINDS OF OUR BABIES...CHANGE THE CODE...BIG UPS GUCH
New teeth?
Hit another lock for 2003 rap lyrics on a deal in comments worldwide in English all bootleg if possible 911
Auto closed captions for this heater - “nawh”
Gucci never stop being a trap-a-holic.
I made so much money listening to Gucci n he don’t know. We gained weight at the same time, lost weight at the same time, got out at the same time. Now I got a big ass crib in Texas n I’m from VA. He got a big ass crib in Miami now. It’s crazy how we grew together n he don’t even know it. I fell bk to the streets for a lil bit bc I’m not a rapper I do other shit but I left it. I’m from VA n nigga I got sum shit to be down wit 1017 in dat rap street shit. I can show my ass fr on sum VA shit. Lex Aligarh days my 🥷 fr. 🥷 know me as Rugar on a street level.

Not ironic that this rapper identifies dry snitching. A non popular music video 15 years ago featured a bag of coke and gucci ends up with fed time. I'm glad I can say ionkno whose coke that was.
Socks are high
Could this really be hopsin?
Love your shit bro  PS: you ain't no clone. You're the real one
He’s evolving
ive always heard gucci mane thrown around ... thought it was slang for something... didnt thing someone existed called as such... unfortunate ...but thats rap these days haha

Jesus died for our sins, please do the right thing, God wake us up everyday giving us chances we don’t deserve. The devil going to try to mess you up, please don’t let him, please say no to evil, we have powers, God gave us the power to speak and we can ask for anything positive in prayer, but we have to know that God is going to give us what we ask for, and know that He already gave it to us, whatever we asked for.

This is one of my fav songs from him and he has a good catalog of music. 4M views, who said you have to talk about sex, drugs, or murder to sell records? His flow on the third verse is 🔥

Man you then really took off with yo flow God bless you man
From fat Gucci and OJ Da Juiceman to new Gucci. Come up is unreal. 1017 since day one
gucci mane trap god
Chiraq starting dissing the dead, Gucci Mane just rode the wave.
And he still has the hardest jewelry game in hip hop history and I ain't even a materialistic typa cat!
For those of us who have been listening to Gucci since the beginning to now, this is more respected than EVERYTHING he has released! We were doing "drills" before these youngins and most of us are survivors, grown men who have put the guns down, are family men raising children we dont wanna see in a box behind senseless bs. We're the OGs now, we need to be telling these youngins this ain't it lil bro! You're better than that! Why you beefing with another man who's just like you, come from a struggle just like you!? Let's build and fight the real enemy...the system!
new gucci is clone dublicate another person u can check his pics back 10 years ago n now his ears r different
Love this
SOMETIMES U GOTTA RECHECK YO GROUP 👎 HAD ANY 💭 OF DISSING THE DEAD YO SLOGAN IT’S THE KID AGAIN

Gucci I got cash I just need views can you drop me a vid I'll pay you
For all those struggling God has a plan for us all. There is nothing He can't turn around, just call upon His Son Yeshua  (Jesus Christ). You have a purpose and it will get better. Choose righteousness
I owe this man so many apologies because I never knew he would make it here and I didn’t believe in him when he was younger and I believe in him now thank you Gucci my sincere apologies Homie
This mf hard asf my boy
This Song Is FUGAZI .
Thts not guwop wake up ppl
Obia voodoo be like:
Take off G-mo skees mask lol
Anybody else think it’s ironic that the word “sword” is the ONLY word this Atlanta dude chose to say how it’s spelled. Atlanta folk abbreviate their abbreviations. But he’s pronouncing the “w”. Cmon mane
good look guwop
Nigga snitch on there self any minute 💯
Great message. But sad that these artists take practically their whole career to send the right massage to their audience. Listen to artists like Bryson Gray, Topher, Tyson James, Marine The Rapper, Tom McDonald, Loza Alexander, Burden, Tech 9 and Zuby.  Just people I'm listening to currently. Their music is amazingly in check with our middle to low class struggles in America.
Been waiting on this side of Gucci Mane! Lead the way boss Mane
I like the old Gucci way more..
watching in my I'm fantastic shirt
Gucci need to stop rapping.
#1 worst song! let's go!!!
Writes a song about dissing the dead ... then just this year he wrote a song talking bout he saw the ghost of pookie... come on clown.
Looks like Gucci's desperate for attention 😆😄😂✌️
Yo I gotta echo what dude below me said guccis transformation last few years is more inspiring than his come up.  An everyone remember, he really from Birmingham, that 205!
I have 2 dead girlfriends...
RIP TROUBLE
Itz guuuuuuucci
Does anybody know when Pooh Shiesty get out ??
Lol, so he’s praising his words of dissing Pookie Loc then the course is say stop dissing the dead. 😂😂😂
🔥🔥
STILL the goat
This is too real for the new generation
👌🙏
This hoe hard bb
We smoken on pookie loc
Gucci a Real one!
Traumatized child so he piss on the covers
it's that x grave
🔥🔥🔥
He admired his work, my dream is to live from music like you, that's why he worked from 7AM to 8PM and winter all my little money to music and one day I went through what I went through I want to be great and that my dreams come true, with patience , humility and a lot of effort, I keep trying every day of the year I know I will make it Amen 🙏
Gucci the King🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Guwop went to hard on this for real seriously🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥
Yeah guwop ‼️
Fuxk Gucci. Karma is going to catch up with him trust  me.
This song go hard 💯💯
That chain looks rated to tow.
hot shit
Og move.
Now this is something special!
fucks with it
Where'd you find this
What’s the point of dissin someone who isn’t hear to answer back, and if it’s to get a reaction out of the person’s love one that’s lame asf, what Kevin gates say about hoes? “Niggas can be ho’s too, seeking for attention from another man”
Gucci said......... Yo face on the news just to get views!
Thats right Guwop talk to em 🔥🔥🔥💯💪🏽
U write well but ur so shy 🤭 😳 man. Amen cooled
Very mature for the Gucci Mane.. Always bump him.. Goin to start bumping this one..
This is dope.
Gucci went in on this one.
Bro you can't say stop dissing the dead and your versus was legendary (You smoking pookie loc rite? These niggas are entertainers
Damn 🔥🔥🔥
This bass fuckin hits
Too late now. He been dissing the dead for years. The young ones have taking this “dissing the dead” shit to another level.   Now it's all out of control Thanks Gucci
Fire
What if he woulda said RiP Poochie Loc at the end 😂😂
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Og brrrr
This Mane speaking Facts.
The Boogie Man of Rap has a body in real life, and even he knows what's going on these days is not the way to go.. .#Salute💯👍🏾🤎

Yes sir
Real music guccie mane got ATL on lock with Lil baby

Listen to Gucci Mane WW3 "Lean" mixtape!  Song: "More of that" Listen to "Gas" and "Molly" mixtapes too why you at it!  Gucci has been flowin like this from day one.  Way back Gucci fans know this.  Good message here from The Kid, turned full grown, well spoken mature man, and mentor.  Stay flexin Guwop!
Great bass
I don't know what you're all here Sounds to me like hes asking for forgiveness
I think this is just  The beginning of a transformation Unfortunately once it does happen a lot you  probably just gonna stop listening
If anybody has any kind of opinion on what I just said or question let me hear it please
Now that I'm 48 I believe with all my heart That music is much more than just entertainment I believe it affects you  Spiritually mentally physically And obviously emotionally If he believes what he saying And others in his positionDo the same thing I believeThey can change the future of this countryThey have been given a gift from GodBut 1st they need to learn how to use itAnd I think Gucci mane just figured it out
Gucci said stop dissing the dead  It’s law now
Nice!!!! Pls share this!!!!
bout fuckin time he said something, he started this shit.
https://youtu.be/n4vubb3tK64
Hang on.... Gucci Mane gon and grewed up!!! The years are blessing this man with wisdom. He was very influence to the young guys, and I hope they actually listen to this not just hear it
LONG LIVE DOLPH 🐬
We need a featuring with Waka Flocka
This is why Gucci mane is the goat of rap ! The best the most relevant  tru rap legend 🙌
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is a Conscious Hip Hop record

Guwop: "we need to stop dissin the dead"  Also Guwop: "I think my house is haunted, yeah by who? the ghost of pookie" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ygeeeeeeeeeeaaaaa this tune cold 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🇲🇽Simon i feel it ese
IT"S UP FROM HERE!!!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvvmxc6wk3A
Wow, Gucci can actually rap.
Now if young’ns really pay attention,they would do this,cuz I don’t get that smoking on a person. It sounds stupid,& foolish.
Gucci dropped this song so he can earn 11 million dollars off the views and pay off people killed by his mistakes. Yall pretty much paying for his sins while he out here repenting
So it took him jail time to realize this? Lock them all up!!! Maybe the culture of Amerixans will change than
Big ups to this man tell the disgrace again they need to here it talking about how they finna kill a brotha. Lets black ball them out making are race a Mockery we dying by the numbers and everybody watching jaws dropping because it ain't kool never was
The dead trying to Rest In Peace…..Gucci Mane turns up with that trap.
Warning look at the mirror you will find me

This is good, real good But let's be 100, BLM would NOT support this message at all Keep this stuff up man, we country needs help and changes from within these types of messages are a great move
Respect
Why's the Gucci fanbase culty now?
BANGER...💯 idk who all got subs but if you do an u not setting alarms off you need to up grade to sundown or skars
2 Timothy 2:22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
Shoulda wore bankroll
Was it TraxNYC jewelry that made that Cuban link chain for him?
Too Late..... It doesn't work that way.  The streets are not forgiving So think before you speak Mr. Changed Man
It’s Gucci 💯🔥
Se sa nou bezwen nan game, realtalk #GoGucciman
Gucci rocking no neck chockers💪🏽
OG GUCCI MANE IS BACK!! 💯
Wow really listen to what bruh Gucci is saying brody speaking big facts 💯
The south got something to say lol
If this song was about him killing black me it would have 10x the views.
Ecclesiasticus/Sirach 8:7 Rejoice not over thy greatest enemy being dead, but remember that we die all.
He changed after the jail/clone sh1t
song is awful should have been left with the dead
Hopsin be out putting in that work as Gucci man
Yup he a clone
Gucci need to sign lud foe
Positive vibe
R.I.P Cucci, your clone sucks!
So good to the world✔️💯
Talking against dissing the dead while flaunting all you got from doing it
If you think this is gucci you’re at least triple vaxxed
I love conservative rap. this is how hip hop started telling what's really going on in the streets #truth #facts
Does anyone actually believe this is the real gucci
First time i listened to a full gucci song in 10 years
Bout Time.... Please 🙏🏿🙏🏿 lead the way Guuucchh!!! More than Rap.. y'all can lead the way.
Love pimp
Damn, if Gucci can evolve as a person from the trap star he once was, anyone can...
FINALLY, A positive message!  The rappers comin' up should listen hard.  Time to put down the steel guys... there's been way too many young lives lost.  BTW... don't these guys know it's not nice to talk badly about the dead?  It's bad karma
All I can do is keep tryin to tell em ahead before they dead. Don't ride with anybody because they prolly a fed, nobody wanna get spread. I bite Pit Bulls in the night, If they touch Kitty, I choak em out before the daylight. Everyone tells you there's no problem yet you know there's some things that ain't right. That's how things go in the ghetto when you got them feels and you white.

Gucci drop another album
I feel reborn everytime gucci mane drops a dope track trap god gucci the illest
Gucci went from filming his own home videos in the dead ass trap in the Ham straight gutter anybody can get it on any given day. The whole case w y thug and gunna 🤷‍♂️😂 shit really be hatnin 🙊😱 mfs get smoked eryday and knowing when and how to show respect is the only way to survive. Gucci made cooking crack cocaine in your hood ball out videos entertaining and a real thing that is still a thing in trap music videos today. You could argue Gucci Mane molded and help create the trap video culture that's popular with as many white people as black people alike lol.... Gucci Mane the only g known for making consistent reliable fire ass whole mixtapes every single incarceration guanteed full of the smoke he was right in the midst of🔥💪🏼🙊🤷‍♂️😂😂😂😂 don't let me forget the Christmas jingle bells fishscale in my nails mixtape every Christmas and if he get out late he might drop 2 in one week and make it up to a nigga😱🙊😂😂😂😂 aint nobody else do it like Gucci 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️I'm jelly AF 😂
sounds like I need to get some heat this dissing all from one trick she needs one to the head especially to anybody that's sold out his dude for a ten buck piece of ass that the whole city's had
This is not Gucci 😮
We need to stop dissin the dead W lyrics
https://youtu.be/U00Cyl6TCSU Miami Street Life 🌴
💯💯💯💯WOP!!!✌🏽
Heard this joint in a mix which was full of drill music. Don't know if the dj knew what he was doing, but afterward I was thinking the rest of the mix was pointless and childish. Gucci message is clear and hypnotic. We need to say no to this music from new drill artists thar have nothing good to contribute to their community.
This is yogotti’s son. Yo gotti clapped your wife
💯💯💯💪🏾
Great message but unfortunately waiting until you're in your 40s with an 8 figure net worth isn't exactly the time to drop something like this. Gucci put this out when the only thing he has to lose now is his reputation in death. Sounds like a way to make something that's really all about you look like you suddenly care about other people a lot.
I guess a lot of y’all not listening to the lyrics 😅
I love u Gucci .....Long live Dolph King Memphis R.I.P beautiful angel love u both Gucci Dolph forever
🙏💯💯
This what a real woman behind you influence does💪👌🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪👌 finally positive much needed
This is wat Growth look like 💯💪🏾

As Trap House 3 about to be played
Glad gucci realizes hes tupac reincarnated..and i say this by the level of people hes reaching...getting your wings back bro
We Black People are Enemies of ourselves and we Black People are killing ourselves and Blaming white People and the same time shouting BLMS
We stay dissin the dead
This song isn’t positive wtf🥴💀
that aint gucci
He’s doing this who’s a Jason mask idk if he being serious or not
Gucci a terrible rapper
POT FARMER DANCE SONG * I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot You better believe it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes They did nothing but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis could not walk around I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack After I smoked some to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around  Got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where wild birds nest  Found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail  Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in a camouflage suit  Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found. Came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone  I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!  By Kansas City Poet Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share! Google = George Bush Tom Zart

This is what I always wanted from Gucci we all know what he has and does but he has the power to actually move some minds
lit
💯🔥🔥
When you are wearing a college education around your neck, we need to have a conversation. Education over jewelry, clothes and cars. I could care less if you don’t “like” what I’m saying.
Wait, are saying to stop killing each other while enticing your peers with jewelry that is completely unnecessary and to be completely honest, gaudy AF. This isn’t “positive “ . Send your kids to college and stop buying dumb 💩 with your money and feeding “THEIR “CHILDREN.
GOUSHY! 🔥
Respect 🙏 💯☘ always to My guy gucci
Gucci who? Gucci mane? Shout out my ni**a Gucci.
Imagine Gucci making a diary of a trap god 👻, Gucci did say he doesn’t even listen to that album anymore because that was a very dark place iykyk would be fire thoe 🔥
He's now a man. Think about where he was day one in this rap shit and think about where he is now. He now understands life. And this song is proof of that. He understands that smoking on pookie loc was wrong. I respect him. Keep growing Gu Wop!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is it just me or do this song remind you of Chief keef monster back from the dead on Gawd

Gucci ur gifted at ur art..helps us realize what the bible says... your mouth speaks whats in ur heart.. And ur gift of mouth let's us speak to all our hearts.. Son of god. What u say and do has consequences
After this it's safe  to say we fittna have a T.I.,Jeezy and Gucci collab in da near future along wit a video..mark my MF words..HISTORY IN DA MAKIN FOLKS!!..
Even tho I fuck wit Jeezy da long way salute to da big dawg Gucci..this message is very well needed bc Pac wld b disappointed in these top Dawgs bc all this killings among us blks is not what he died for..y'all mf betta open y'all eyes bc like Pac said "It aint them that's killing us its "US"  that's killing us"..use ur brain or b a victim..
To all u mf who thought Jeezy punked out when Gucci got disrespectful in da Versus who laughing now??..Ima Jeezy fan and don't fuck wit Gucci too much but to me seem like Gucci finally got Jeezy point..now y'all comment on dat shit there..

Grown man who did Time supposedly with a wife and child at home. But you rapping like you're 15-year-old. This is corny. Too damn old. You're not doing any of this crap in real life. This man is a joke and all these other old ass rappers are jokes. Catering to teenagers when you're old as hell with your old ass wife
This hard!

It’s too late Gucci yo ass started a trend that’s not going anywhere
Gucci get that white Jesus out your yard and put original Jesus aka black up there
Shootin like Da Baby Dey break n my home
So you start the beef with Gucci on the stage at the versus Battle and then you made a song right after that this and Pookie look not what now you want to start now you want to talk about stop this in the dead bro who paying you it's so weird ass home bro
Burrrr
We gotta make a change It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes Let's change the way we eat Let's change the way we live And let's change the way we treat each other You see, the old way wasn't workin' So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive  -----Tupac
The charleston white effect
Seeing guchi from when he started up until now is amazing. The change
Whose mausoleum
Whose Henson-parris
Look at that chain
It's only 4 letters to describe Gucci  G.O.A.T!✨️
Gucci my new favorite rapper. God is good. In Jesus name. Amen.
This the age in life where it’s a blessing to make it to your 40’s. Most people take a look back at all the wrong they’ve caused and dirt that was done and have a strong sense of remorse. Gucci definitely showing us that you don’t stay in those young stages of life and when you know better you do better. This bro is mainly apologizing for his influence he had on the rap game and now taking responsibility for his actions whether in drill or trap music.  One of my favorite artist, definitely good to see the transformation!! ✌🏾 ⬆️ A-town
Guccie The Top forsho!
Like it says on Gucci's hoody "LONG LIVE DOLPH"..This beat is so hard I got this one repeat!
People better get ready for Jesus for he is coming soon enough den you think

Gucci or LeBron? 🤔
Same ones saying this not the real Gucci Mane is the same ones stuck on the block stuck in the hood. What I mean by that is they don't want to elevate or do something different. Nothing wrong being in the hood hustling just don't be a bum with a one set mind. Grow to want better.

Gucci not messing around this year you better get out the way
Yeah it's all good, but if you all notice they always flashing there gold and wealth diamond rings expensive cars like we to be impressed by that shit. They forget who put them out there and that's the fan that buys and goes to there concerts etc.  This dude always flashing just like all of them. Nobody likes a show off, especially when they living of the fan, and no appreciation for us, who put them out there like movie stars they ain't shit with out us. But I ain't seen no humble but there flashy car's gold money fuck that shit, then they wonder why they get shot.  Humbleness is everything and knowing you wouldn't even be out there with out the fan. You want rap then don't show off. But keep it real humble, I don't care about your million dollar Ring car teeth. Look at me here u there, fuck that shit the fan is the humble not these show offs that wouldn't even look at us
The RAPPER TRAPAMILLION YouTube music please
It's about damn time someone is trying to spread some knowledge in a song🔥🔥🔥🔥

Real shyt Gucci!
Real spit! Ninjaz be saying anything to get recognized not knowing u can get merked ova wordz 💯
Gucci Mane be really killin it man.😆👌
Gucci talking that old head realness.. younginz take note.. we need yall alive!!!!!!
Definitely a positive step for him, especially considering he's admitted to dissin the dead, and the fact that they trying to hit everybody with RICO charges. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Much respect and love for this GUCCI!🔥
This Mane Gucci solid for this one
YB better
Rico law got these killers singing about God lol,,
Ngga said “ ion gotta do features w/nggas on songs when he feature yo name on head stones” dam that’s cold asf yo
pressure
How much longer hopsin?
That's not Gucci
Now thats reality rap giving you awareness of what's going on! Not just another fool claiming they real cause they from the hood and got guns, it take more to be a real ni$$a than just killing somebody!
This is the walking definition of growth and development but Gucci we both know shid done gone too far I got deads they got deads things was said that can't be taken bacc an just from surfing the internet an drill music I know there's allot deeper beefs going on all around the globe people have said an done things to they opps so disrespectfully that not even Jesus Christ himself can stop a mf from getting smoked but I do love this song tho 🙅🏽‍♂️🧢✊🏽💯
Another #1 Hit Song Awesome Song.
But he still said he put someone name on a stone, reminding ppl he killed someone, dissin the dead...But he's shown growth 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Members only
Growth?! Positive Music?! GUCCI?! Idk who this nigga is but the jig is up my guy. And on top of that this shit trash. Give this nigga a bottle of lean Neoooooow.

Everything about this was on point! His flow and his delivery....y'all actually listen to his bars? He has grown as a man and an artist he even admitted his mistake and how it has gotten carried away even though he started it. Give this man his flowers....salute
Yeah this trap shit had its moment but the drill has taken over what else does this man really have to rap about that he hasn't already said over an over
You ain’t start no trend nigga😂😂. Mf’ers been dissing. Fuck atl dudes. Florida🫶🏽904 shit
This the truest shit he ever said, need to stop dissing the dead 💀💯
People really need to listen to him , niggas wanna be so hard and die over senseless shit , be fighting and killing over blocks that they own no property on 💀

Gucci doing a great job of damage control. Never too late to change
Pooh shiesty ain't coming home for a long time bro, he made some poor choices based on the money he was making...gotta change when u level up like that even if it's hard
My favorite Gucci song so far. He going in with this one. Real Rap is back!!!!
I appreciate you Gucci we need to stop killing each other ..we to powerful and mind set in disfunction why we hate each other is mind boggling united we stand divided we fall
Gucci always puts out 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gucci was one of the first to diss the dead in a song“go dig your partner up nigga, bet he can’t say shit”
It ain't never gonna stop it ain't suppose to look who rapping lmgdao clowns fans an followers go hand in hand
Yes Sir

Long Live Paper Route Frank FOREVER💯💯💯💯💯  Rest in Heaven Trouble💯💉💉💉💉💉
Crazy how his flow and barz are connecting with current events in the rap game.
Real Trap Shiiit
I no he has to continue to represent Dolph, Facts
I been listening to Gucci since day 1,very impressed how he has grown up an matured A BOSS ,and things he has done for alot of artist's
Thought slaughter gang was back
Crazy how the word Jit @ 2:14 which originated in my neighborhood Richmond Heights, Florida (Down Souff, Miami) on Rickmond Park back in 96 is used in today rap lol. 99% of y’all don’t know where it came from nor know what it truly means. Except for me and a few others. 99 jams played that one song so much back then it slurred/warp a word made it sound like Jit. If you’re a Tupac fan you probably know the Song.
TUSCALOOSA AL LOST MY FAMILY
Damn..Gucci really had some shit to say. Salute.
Bro got haunted a bit too hard by Pookie😂
God dam the bass is so clean my neighbors said dam son what system you rocking
Gucci strapped like Sylvester Stallone 🔥🔥

Change is good
Nice. But we need club bangers from  you.  Also start back using that trap voice . 😆
Nobody is really listening he making a statement saying he started this shit with "Truth" he never said stop dissing the dead he started this mane ...
What about pookie lo? Think you had some shit to say to jeezy at the verses battle…jus sayin. You right tho, people gotta stop all this dissing the dead, might extend some resorts lives
Shyt was fyah👍🏾
Gucci u been killin it 🔥🔥🔥
Who ever is reading this, God has a plan, trust the processes…💜
He changed up for the good..
Damn he lost 1m subs?
*Thats some REAL shit , there* ! Rap ain't been about music for a minute. Its devolved into a death cult. It's become a evil entity that feeds off of negative energy, evil thoughts emotions. Bring that real art back, uplifting music. Stop bangin' that ol' fuck shit 'cause thats whats getting niggas killed at parties and shit. Props to Gucci Mane for addressing the situation.
Is this the same Gucci mane who's house is haunted by the ghost of pookie? 🤔
We should boy cott the radio since we already know they're not gonna play songs like this. They're exposed now for only playing black genocide and whore music for our children
TRANSLATION: I taught this new generation to openly carry pistols or rifles and shoot your pops. Ooo and I almost forgot. Shoot your opps and dis them in a song.Ooo dang almost missed one part.before you shoot make sure u tell ya baby you'll see them in 25-life and send out a group text,''  please put money on my account ,"county jail" my name.,anything would be great,???!?!?!

Righting your wrongs.
This the age in life where it’s a blessing to make it to your 40’s. Most people take a look back at all the wrong they’ve caused and dirt that was done and have a strong sense of remorse. Gucci definitely showing us that you don’t stay in those young stages of life and when you know better you do better. This bro is mainly apologizing for his influence he had on the rap game and now taking responsibility for his actions whether in drill or trap music.  One of my favorite artist, definitely good to see the transformation!! ✌🏾 ⬆️ A-town ⬇️
Thats some real 💯 Gucci is grown in this Game so i know he should show some example..
Straight fire!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Its Gucci
🤧🤧🤧🤧
that mask is hard!!!
Gucci DEFINITELY the 1st Rapper to Diss the Dead 💯💯
gucci
This right here that old Gucci I know this shit not right but I fuck wit it 💯💯👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Why should I care about my name on a song? I'm the one who put your boy name on the stone. I dissed the dead and I know I was wrong. But I'm shooting like DaBaby you break in my home..... First the call you a God, then they call you a clone.... Gucci talking and y'all ain't listening
This nigga boo boo nd y’all niggas saying this shit hard it’s wats wrong wit out society now
Gucci 4 President 🤟🏿💯

I wish they would've heightened his vocals.  The beat is HARD, but it's drowning out his voice!

yo... this is ill
Gucci a lyrical genius, can’t say nun’ otherwise
Powerful song and message.
I see the negative comments  with younger people hating because of this video of course when your young you think you can defeat anything including death,  the tomb stones are being shown  people have a problem with that, yes this rapper helped aid in the destruction, but white media is using these rappers as weapons of Genocide, if this young generation dont want to take heed then its to your destruction i even remember in my generation they had a stop the violence movement and the killings never stopped, wake up to your heritage and who you really are and you will see were under the curse of the most high, we glorify killing because we were taught that all the way from slavery wake the hell up what has gangsta rap done for the black or any community , look up Margaret sanger eugenics and planned parenthood AGENDA 21 etc. educate yourselves !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ouch! Gucci!!!!
gods telling the world something nobody wanna listen gucci mane finally knows that secret if u live being hateful it will follow the devil exist
Is he talking about when he dissed pokie lo or big dump

Real recognize real. It's time for somebody to stand. I was starting to feel these rappers had no concious selling out their people, specifically the youth!!! Selling them death and confusion. Street life not the way. When you know better you do better. Salute Gucci.
All these years, Gucci still goin hard. How do he do it??!💪🏾
It took his homies to die to feel like this I been listening to Gucci since juice man says
You did this it went hard.
Real Shhh....... Pay Attention.......
Protect Gucci Now before more than ever RIP to the loved ones

Legend⚖️
I respect it and all but honestly the way this shit going I think is kind of to late for all that you should of done this shit 2013  or even 2015 or 2016 before or after chief keen n em boyz came out Shit I know the intentions are what count but after dam near 7 years?  after damage has been done !? How many rappers have they killed or even the same own rappers killing there own friends ?! Ni99a it’s too late for that mr.Smokin on pookie
Gucci my favorite artist but maybe when him and KEEF was together he influenced him I thought KEEF started all that dissing the 💀 but I pray it stop it’s bad bad karma
Gucci this track is so f¥<king 🔥🔥 🔥hot  and the words are so true!! Me alone trying to hit the like button for it 1billion times for it but unfortunately I can only hit it once!
YES!!!...A LEGEND SPEAKING AND STANDING ON IT. The problem is we just scared of love.. whats must dangerous is that THEY scared of us to start loving EACH OTHER.  MY GOD LET THEM KNOW HOW THE DEVIL WORK AND HOW TO DEFEAT HIM.   KING GUCCI 🤴🏿 👑 Thanks... I know how the truth hurts. But I see how much of a man you are to take it.   Let the dead rest... YOU ARE LIVING.
GUCCI!!!
Everybody in Atlanta is cleaning up 😂 That DA gotem shook
Let’s see him make a song saying stop rapping about the TRAP
🔥🔥🔥🔥

When I seen that haunted statue that cry's blood that is in the haunted ATL cemetery 🪦 ...  Interesting
🔥🔥🔥💨💨💨 a legend 🙌🏽
When rappers start pushing music like this the industry will get rid of them or turn them into a veggie. But with the industry they make sure you die. THEY PUT A INSURANCE POLICY ON THE ARTIST BECAUSE THEY A LIABILITY. WHEN THEY DIE THEY CASH OUT
Am I watching something different?  A little bit of positivity, then showing all of the jewels and ice that these dudes get murdered for!
Yeaaaaa aye Gucci I can’t lie u won a fan wit this ☝🏾
Respect Gucci, make that shit lame to diss the dead.
Oakland City Cemetery?

Gucci really who T.I. trying to be.
Glad he mentioned his artist
Even if he a clone… at least they got him doing something positive… so I’m with it.

Heyyy
I miss that old sound when he talk
Legucci Mane
I HAD BEEN HAVING DEEP THOUGHTS ON THIS.PRAYING FOR IT TO CEASE WE ALL NEED JESUS!!!THANKS FOR PUTTING IT OUT THERE AGAIN GUCCI GOD BLESS
My Dawg Gucci.  Step up the lyrics on another Level.  Keep that flow.
Gucci Mane aint one to disrespect the dead, I think he was taking shots at Jeezy when he said, "I think my house is haunted, yeah, by who? The ghost of Pookie." Gucci jus letting him know that he still here and they failed at trying to kill him.
…..but Guwop STAY dissn Pookie (jeezy dead homie thoz who don’t kno)…. 🤦🏽‍♂️
"All that subliminal stuff be passing me off" lol he really said that? We know his history. Respect to gucci. Street mfr n a real nigga, but one thing he never mastered are subliminal bars. Since the beginning of hip hop. Why he mad about that? Oh I know, cause of eminem, he doesn't give credit to eminem cause he knows eminem is lyrically the best in every shape n form on hip hop/rap. Cause eminem has paved the way for A LOT of rappers now n days. That song he made with Mariah talking down on em when em was going through his worst. Then em came back n did the feature on "forever" n took that song. Listen when gucci says "Pinocchio" on the Mariah song n then listen to the "forever" song when em says "yall been waiting for Pinocchio to pock his nose". And yall know the rest.

Dissing the dead started in Chicago foh gucci
Muito sucesso guerreiro sou seu fã
It's a lil late for all that Gucci but you right!
man it feels good to say I been listening to Guwop for almost 20 years!
Yeah let's change the furture of the next generation listening to music
🔥.
If these guys actually had good taste in clothing dot dot dot they could probably start setting some trends that weren’t actually ugly as shit
Bruh all you do is diss pookie 😂
The holds weight because Gucci actually been there and done it. You need people like him that aren’t just typing online & scrutinizing with no solutions.
Ohhhh ! This how u set a trend Wop
Some people still don't realize how big of a influence Gucci Mane and Boosie was on this generation in the South
THAT IS NOT GUCCI MANE >>  IMPOSTER >> FAKE >> SCUD >> FRAUD >> MOISSANITE >> MICKEY MOUSE >> REPLICA
😂😂😂😂😂 Man this is weak like the rest of his music 🎶 u might lose bring cells listening to this.
Where's Mrs. Davis? 💖 You 2 together

Big Gucci ✊🏾😎
LETS FUCCCKING GOOOOO GUCCCCI
Gucci Mane always hard 💯🔥
Had To Be Here. #TheNew1017 #PayAttentionChicago #RIPtoThemALL #BigGucci #Growth #Maturity "Everything Sweet Till It Happen To Them. Von said it best, it ain't going ever stop until both sides gone. #Cycles #LastManStanding This song in heavy rotations.
No talent here!!! This clown has no education or understanding of music theory.   We went from Mozart to worthless rap.  The decline of the modern age. These fools do not even understand how foolish they look all while they play pretend.
This song is so needed with all these clout chasing rappers using the names of legends for attention especially 2Pac
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shout out to Big Gucci !!💪🏾💪🏾💯💯 much respect King 💯
Burrr🔥🔥🇬🇾🇬🇾
gucci is getting better,,, idk how that wAS POSSIBLE
S/o Pookie Loc😂
Glad a real OG speakin on dis fuck shit
(french fan) Big Gucci the best
Voice is trash.  Mixing is terrible.  Good attempt at positive message.   The imagery takes away from it though.
GUCCI BE SPEAKING THE TRUTH AND TELLING THEM! LETS GO THIS A BANGER!💯
Only rapper that stayed relevant for this many years
I hope this starts a NEW trend for the black community. Good for you gucci, atonement goes a long ways.
TREAL TALK

I RESPECT THIS SONG BUT GUCCI U DIDNT START THE DISSING THE DEAD THATS VON AND CHICAGO WHO STARTED THAT. SORRY CANT LET U CLAIM THAT GUCCI
🙏❤I hope his associates will stop releasing the murder-murder music and put back positive energy like he does
No one probably would admit it, but Charleston White sparked this. He said rappers diss the dead all the time and nobody had a problem with it. His msg is getting across.
This my favorite Gucci track now ...
Let's Go Gucci!! Bouldercrest, ATL's finest still strong!!💯

He make a hit for us to jam every weekend and it number one we still here grim woop 🙌 thank you 💨💯
† We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing in our hearts that Jesus died for us, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we have done or will do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                           †  Romans 10:9

Jaydayoungin r.i.p :(
This nigga the absolute truth forever
Holla'n at Jeezy like a man a be a start
Sum 2 prove pt 2
*wtfjh*  "what the fuck just happened?"; what you say when you get super blazed on some good weed and then something happens but you have no fucking clue what's going on and then you just transport to the present and you're thinking "what the fuck just happened?" and then you say "what the fuck just happened?" and then you burst into a psychotic laugh at your own stupidity.
The grim reaper 💯🔥

This beat must have been held in the vault for 12 years. This sounds like that classic Gucci I was bumpin when I was 23 back in 09'. I bang wit the message tho.
everyone trying to clean up their music ever since Young Thung went to jail. FEDS listening to the music lol.
This why Gucci always been the man… he can think for himself.. if Boosie and Durk r somebody get on this… then maybe things will change
VEM PRO BRASIL GUCCI... AGUARDAMOS VOCE AQUI 🔥🔥🔥
I wanna know what he says on this músic... The comments are funny :0
Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. Be baptized by full submergence of water and follow the ten commandments. The sabbath starts Friday Sunset and Ends Saturday Sunset. Whatever is considered a holi-day in America is not, but in fact the opposite. Stop with the pagan traditions of Christmas and Easter, the Bible stems off the Hebrew calendar and not the Gregorian.
Respect gucci as a OG for making this song 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
RIP DOLPH AND KING VON
Yep the trend smoking on the dead he started that when said we smoking on Pookie Loc tonight

🤔Always don't train your gender, you leave them late, not like K4T 💚
Dang the ATL skyline kinda sad… 😬
You want your kin to stop targeting each other? A good start would be to stop calling each other "niggas". It may have had it's purpose at some point but right now all it does is maintain racial division forcing a percentage of the bloodline to rage war against one another further hindering your hierarchical position.  An exclusive word by definition is pure racism in a time where it matters the most.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love it brr brr
Long live Trouble🙏🕊
Love the new whoop make a right out of a wrong
The real Gucci has risen from the dead
A much needed solid message in this track 💯. Hopefully they actually HEAR instead of just listen.

If he go public with the mother or family member of the dead he dissed and apologize ill take him seriously
Yes finally a real one coming to say stop the killings.
It’s official, Gucci has the best jewelry in the game.  Not tacky. Not a stupid choker chain. HUGE links, all ice. With a proportional, not tacky pendant. Doesn’t wear 3 watches on the same wrist. Minimal, but still bigger than anyone.  And I’m not even a jewelry guy.
Gangsta Gospel! Big Gucci 💯
💯💯💯
Gucci❤️
I think he did this for nyc bc all the drill songs over her are most lyrics talking about smoking on dead opps

“Except Pookie LoKe. Fuck that guy” - Gucci Mane probably
Genius
1017.💯💪🔥
I appreciate the attept. I'd pull this video, run the overall DB on the track up, then limit it in the master that way it'll slap harder.
Proud of Him... Really matured 💯💪
Pookie Lo 😂 cap

The Black community acknowledge what Gucci is doing. Preciate you mane
I wonder how much that chain around his neck cost
Rip Jaydayoungan!! 😇🕊
No lies told
He should do a remix with bone thugs on this
Nigga culture is so fucked up that when a Nigga like Gucci matures by getting in shape, getting married, taking care of his health, and raps about not disrespecting the Dead, Niggas assume he must be a clone.
Next song gone be smoking on pookie dead ass 🤦🏾‍♂️
Big Guwop!
Guwap so raw It's Gucci 💯💯💯💯

Shit too hard 🔥🔥
Gucci is not from this Planet. His Flow comes from Jupiter 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🔥🔥🔥
Much respect to Guwop but he didn’t start this “Dissing the dead” trend. Chicago did, so it’s going to take the likes of Chief Keef or Lil Durk doing a song like this with a Gd for the people to really get this message. But other than that, he’s right and I like the fact that he’s growing.
Made me tear up alil 💖
GO DIG YO PARTNER UP NIGGA BET HE CANT SAY SHIT!! #TRUTH young Jeezy diss!!
Ganggggggggg since I was a baby 💯💯💯💯

Don't trick your whole life away like a magician You can't stand the heat, you best get out the kitchen...#GucciMane
HUGE SHOUT OUT TO GUCCI MANE!!!! I LOVE WHAT YOU DOIN'. EVERYONE IS HURT BY DEATH OF LOVED ONES AND I CAN'T STRESS THIS EXACT POINT ENOUGH TO ALL KINDS OF FOLKS. YOU DON'T SPEAK ON THE DEAD LIKE SOME FOLKS HAVE COOSEN TO DO. THOSE WHO ARE DECEASED AREN'T POWERLESS, THEY CAN AND WILL HAUNT YOUR ASS - JUST THINK ABOUT IT, (THE FATHER, THE SON, & THE HOLY *SPIRIT* because spirits exist and are wayyyyy tooooo real.)  AND YOUR KIDS WILL BE THE ONES WHO ARE PUNISHED FOR THE THINGS YOU DO. KIDS ARE THE INNOCENT ONES, PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT SHIT, CUZ THE BIBLE TELLS YOU ABOUT THESE THINGS. REGARDLESS OF THE GRUDGES AND HATRED BEING HELD IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE SO QUICK TO KILL FOR A LIL BIT OF MONEY, IT ISN'T WORTH WHAT YOU LOSE FROM IT, NOTHING IS SO BAD THAT YOUR COWARD ASS FUCK BOY CAN PAY MONEY TO ANOTHER PIECE OF SHIT TO KILL SOMEONE WHO ISN'T  EVEN AFFECTED BY THIS MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE 2 PEOPLE WHO HAD THE DISAGREEMENT TO BEGIN WITH. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY SOMEONE ELSE TO KILL FOR YOU THEN THERE WAS NEVER ANY ISSUES TO BEGIN WITH. THAT SHIT COULD HAVE BEEN LET GO, YOUR EGO IS THE PROBLEM IF THAT WAS THE CASE. IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT AND IN A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION IS THE ONLY REASON TO NEED TO PROTECT YOUR SELF AND LOVED ONES FROM HARM. NEITER DOLPH NOR TROUBLE WERE DOING SHIT WRONG WHEN THEY WERE KILLED. A TRUE MAGGOT IT TAKES TO CARRY OUT ANOTHER MANS JEALOUSY AND HATRED.
Free all my artists, let them out of prison ### Green
First they call you a god then they call you a clone But my plug tryna bring the dope in on a drone....

JESUS CHRIST has been given all power in heaven, on earth, and under the earth. HE says" call unto me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things you know not of" HE will answer then you will know. These are the last days HE could remove those of us HE has redeemed and the children at any moment. Start calling on HIM it's no joke.

Gucci acknowledges his past mistakes on “Dissin the Dead,” rapping, “I’m the one put your boy name on a stone/I dissed the dead and I knew it was wrong.” “I know I should be more careful with the shitt that I said, I feel like I started a trend,  they never gonna stop They gon’ keep dissin’ the dead.” ❤️❤️❤️
It’s Gucci
Never Go Stop #Dissin_The_Dead

DIS THAT OLD GUCCI BUT MORE MATURE
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its too late Gucci.... You really started this shit and now its a popular thing to do. Then put insult to injury, you kept dissing the same dead person all the way until 2021. You have records on the radio of you dissin the dead guy you put down. This is literally your fault, why? because dissin the dead became played out in 1995 and you are the only one who brought it back in 2007. Now you wanna tell rappers to stop dissing the dead because it became popular. I respect your apology and realization. But like I said before, its too late now.
Yes sir let’s keep pushing this message 💯💪🏽
Great to see someone like Gucci try to preach to the community.  These youngins need to stop with the violence.

I think this track solidifies GUCCI is top ten hall of fame rappers too be still relevant in different era is crazy
Dead is disciplined
These new kids won't know about the Gucci we grew up on we crazy old
LEGEND!!!! Respect to the fullest!
Raps a young mans game and they don’t know anything about life, we as rap fans need to stop supporting the ignorance cause we all been there and know that ain’t it.. and legends like Gucci need to drop more knowledge and wisdom instead of playing into the ignorance, salute big Guwop for this.
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 it’s about time someone said something 👑
Man I wish I could reach a rapper for a powerful lawyer I just need to get a misdemeanor in this case I'm fighting I need the second chance I never really got in life man I don't want a felony at this time in my life it just seems like a turn around for me and this is the only dark cloud in my way

Gucci right on this he do feel somewhat responsible for all these rappers dissing the dead cause prior to his 2012 "Truth" song you really wasnt hearing it in the music but after that infamous track you started to hear it more and more and here in 2022 it has become an ugly trend.
💯💯💯
This is one of the realest songz this year that's that grown man s*** real man s***

This the old Gucci flow.
Talk to em big Gucci
Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven in this generation #repent turn away from this wicked world
When you're already rich, official, we all know who you are/ no reason to doubt you, this is the right thing to do. We can say real shit and still make it hard. I don't wanna keep seeing my brothers kill eachother. This 1 song or even 100 more won't make it stop. But it may influence one person who isn't too deep in yet to rethink. This is what we need. To at least TRY to do better.
Mannn Atl Jacob went crazy on this mf 🤦🏾‍♂️🔥🔥🔥

Respect to the real OG for addressing the madness... Thanks bruh 💯
Appreciate you Gucci. Streets need this one 🤞🏿
Fr tho that dissing the dead stuff always been wicked I used to hate when Von and Durk did it. Especially mentioning the names of the people at that point you are bringing your fans into the bullshit you done or was involved in. You got fans dissing people they don’t even know, it was certain songs I couldn’t listen to. I would rather rappers not mention names and just be vague so that us as the listener can just take it as being fabricated when they talk about that stuff for entertainment because at the end of the day the rapper is just a character
🎵🎵🎵
I respect 🫡 💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gotta respect Gucci,, he holding 1017 down💯💯

That’s 💯💯
Yea they need to take heed to it, stop the dissing. But at the same time, what's done is done lives lost its a cycle that they stuck in. Hopefully somebody wake up & just say ok no more get back. No more eye for an eye. That's what it's gon take.
Chopper so close that am never alone
Grown man bars
Gucci got a conscious now cause he has a son and wife lol. It's too late now bro. The deaths and dissing won't stop bro. Unfortunately
Please don’t start taking credit for shit u ain’t start
🖤
Damn Shits Really just A cycle RIP Jaydayoungan 🙏🕊
We here for it
This is what’s needed; take it from the real ones, we the next upcoming generations we gotta do better for all of humanity. We all we got, we got to stop going against each other. It’ll never solve anything; I promise. Learn how to come together despite our differences. That’s how we grow stronger as one, how we all should be. Imagine the greater things we’d be without being so in our feelings for the wrong reasons. It’s up to us to create the future so let’s create it with REAL GREATNESS.☀️ WE HAVE TO RISE AS ONE IN ORDER TO BECOME THE GREATEST AS ONE. It’s up to us, it’s on us. Let’s stop being fake an start being real to one another, that’s the only way we’ll evolve out of this darkness an into the spiraling light of openness.
Banger
This song hard, Gucci gotta get a new videography tho. Videos be boring as hell
Real Big Homie 🙏🏽🥶🚀

Rest in peace to all the rappers we lost this year

RIP JAYDAYOUNGAN  These are just a FEW of the number of hip hop artists shot to death. I just listed all the (more known names). How many gotta die before we finally get it ?   Tupac Shakur dies on September 13, 1996 of gunshot wounds suffered in a Las Vegas drive-by shooting.  Notorious B.I.G., is shot to death at a stoplight in Los Angeles. The murder was thought to be the culmination of an ongoing feud between rap music artists from the East and West coasts.  Rapper Proof, born Deshaun Holton, was shot and killed on April 11, 2006, at approximately 4:30 a.m. at the Triple C Club on 8 Mile Road in Detroit.   During the afternoon of June 18, 2018, American rapper and singer Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy, known professionally as XXXTentacion, was fatally shot in an apparent robbery just outside RIVA Motorsports, an upscale seller of motorcycles and watercraft in Deerfield Beach, Florida.  On March 31, 2019, Hussle was fatally shot outside his store in South Los Angeles. Eric Holder, a 29-year-old man who confronted Hussle earlier that day, was arrested and charged with murder two days later. Holder was found guilty of first-degree murder on July 6, 2022.  Born Bashar Jackson, Pop Smoke was taking a shower when his masked assailants “rushed” into his upstairs bedroom and confronted him, prosecutors claim. He was gunned down by a suspect who was just 15 years old at the time following a struggle, according to testimony from LAPD witnesses at a preliminary hearing in May.Oct 15, 2021  Dayvon Daquan Bennett, known professionally as King Von, was an American rapper from Chicago, Illinois was Shot Dead on Nov 6, 2020 in Atlanta.    BadAzz Music Syndicate rapper Mo3 was gunned down on a Dallas highway in broad daylight. November 11, just days after King Von was murdered in Atlanta.   Young Dolph shot 22 times by attackers, rapper's autopsy report reveals. Rapper Young Dolph, aka Adolph Thornton Jr., suffered multiple gunshot wounds to his head, neck and torso when he was killed at a hometown bakery in November 17, 2021.  (Drakeo didn’t get shot he was stabbed to death backstage by a mob of anonymous invaders just before a concert) On December 18, 2021, backstage at a festival in Los Angeles, in his hometown. A group of 40 or so people ambushed Drakeo. One of them stabbed him to death.

✊🏾
Gucci this song fuckin great man these beats unreal
RIP JayDaYoungan … this is dope… hope they hear this
Positive
Gucci bout to make a lot of rich white people mad with this one. This coming from a man who actually had to kill somebody out of self defense and not somebody who killed just because it’s trendy to have that on your record. These lil niggas don’t care tho, but I’m sure gucci peer’s respect it. He actually can rap about this because he actually lived it 💯
Generational Annointing
Thank you Gucci we needed this. Let's see who follow suit💯

I dont listen to Gucci but this is a message that had to be said
LL 🐬 LL SKOOB
It’s Gucci 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🐐
Thx Bro. This is What we made music 4
Straight 🔥💯
Gucci read for when .Georgia becomes a new gTLD. Gucci, don’t blame yourself for starting any trends. Florida and Chicago stuff is off the handle with that trend, becoming an accepted route for clout, people prolly even set up people from their own sets for the clout and maybe even sometimes in real fucked up situations life insurance. I dissed on John McAfee though and I kinda don’t want to back down on what I said/want to leave that past behind me, had reasons won’t explain, I really don’t even believe he’s dead though, witness protection or some shit imo, seemed he staged a whole buncha shit and was just working with government to make a point about tax evasion consequences, could be wrong though, though I know he was fake about a lot. Though really good message. Reminds me of the immortal technique song “Toast to the Dead”. Gucci setting a good example with this song, progressing. Though man don’t blame yourself for nothing, personal responsibility is great though cant hold yourself responsible for what others do. And I got that murder was the case album on vynal, honestly I respect that you defended yourself and your stuff, very different than just dissing opps for no reason. Though it’s times dead people just diss people they don’t know/had nothing to do with. And another song that comes to mind, is the shot in the head lyric, is Lloyd banks “die one day” where he says “pray to god’s I get shot because I don’t like surprises”, as being shot in the head if quickly fatal one of the quickest ways to go(I plan on and want to live a long time, just saying, dying slow aint no fun either, really really depending how, which is why I like how some countries have legal assisted suicide, when I was real aidsly I was like aight it’ll get better, but was pretty unpleasant to live at the worse). I feel the worse for people who get shot a bunch and wind up in wheelchairs, which is why I respect how OJ stands on no attempted murder/no leg shooter (as fucked up as that sounds). Sad though that things are the way they are and even gotta address that in your song. It’s people on some demon level ish where reality just a video game to them and the killings mean nothing. Some places in the world way worse, where the good die young shit too real. Though I have faith eventually things will change for the better, or at least I pray it will.
wopppp
Even tho man not perfect Gucci still put out a positive message🤧
Tough
Thank you. A lot of these young people look up to you and this that big influence they need... #BigGuWOP
Thank you sir
Fire
🔥🔥🔥
Knock this shit out with fists. Stop pulling strap just bc you got it. Take a L or W. Too many folks life's being treated as expendable
💯💣👌
Good morning my nigga
That's real shit 💯👌
Everybody need to speak up, this the stuff we need, right now... youngins need a cold #1017 preachin' from @Gucci if you're rappin' you should be competing on who stackin' they money the highest, everyone still stacks, everyone still wins! Not the stuff they done invented themselves out there in the streets, their "bb gun wars" be on fentanyl and meth fueled, but they're toting 45's, 9mm's, AR's... (anything but a tank or anti-aircraft.. or a bb gun, no bb guns...) Nobody wins... No matter who gets what shot off first... Everyone looses. Get it together guys & gals before every one of ya are gone.
If I kill you in the act of you trying to kill me im forEVA dissin yo ass‼️
Start and Finish a trend #BOSSSHIT!
Wish blessings to every and and any person who reading this 🦍💙

Thanks for sharing your intellectual spirituality. It's only up from here. I hope they get the message. #world saver #aquarius # Davis #loveandpeace

Preach Gucci. Pimp C and Pac would be proud. Most Big Artist got a major platform but don't push enough positivity to the world. Dis what gotta to happen for change to start. O.G s should school des youngens and let dem know dis ain't da way. Powers in number s. We gotta stand together or All crumble.

Man who the fuck is this? Yawl really think that’s Gucci Still
Ok guwop 👏
Wop always been lyrical and cold but this is crazy
Big Wop,these niggas is gimmicks 💯
That chain huge
RIP dolph 🐬
Gucci dropped this the exact second that Jaytheyoungin was confirmed dead, in my opinion doing that at that time is disrespectful and completely goes against what he’s talking about. He doesn’t even sound sincere, it’s like he’s taking credit for starting a trend. He even did it this year on his song with Durk, anybody tryna say Gucci is growing should really look at Jeezy to see sincere growth
Don’t get me wrong the old Gucci was better but this Gucci is wised up and humbled gucci
🏁
POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS. 💯💯💯♥️‼️
Wop!!
Talk yo talk ucci
These Rico charges got mfs acting different lol. I love it!

Call all these murderous young rap niggas you know... And ask them to hop on this remix ‼️ We can make our streets safe again ‼️" they " want us to kill each other off ‼️ it's obvious at this point.

What trend he started chitown been dissing the dead
RIP TROUBLE & Long Live Dolph 😞
Dope song , I found this while listening to the song “Dupe - Rutina “
If its 1017 am chilled😍😍
How can this Gucci be in this business for this long and not improving in his raping abilities? Even little kids this days rap far better than him, he just gets a good beat and ruins it all, imagine if somebody like Jeezy did this song how exciting it could have been. To make it even worse he did a video with him only just standing on the video all the way, such a foolish man, he has no creative skills lyrically or visually
I know one thing is for sure.. that fly/big a** mosquito in the back famous
Let me guess Charleston white going to come dissing this
This hard

Gucci definitely started the trend of dissing dead ass niggas and it ravaged the chiraq drill scene and the rest is history. Time to change for the better.
If only people would listen
Get rid of the white Jesus. He was a bum.
Good job fake gucc
You start off on dissin the dead now you want to stop.... don't put your feet in that water, it's 🦈 no going back... can't rewind
Seems like he's replying to Blac Youngsta's video on a graveyard dissing Dolph with this one
Gucci never fall💯 respect big CEO
We needed this for the young rappers more than anything the death rate has never been this bad in the rap game but to hear gucci talking some sense is really dope 💪🏾
Don’t trick yo whole life away like a magician

I thought Chicago drill rappers started that trend years ago
I liked the song while the add was playing 😀
Gucci Mane is A Goat, u carried my childhood with other rappers!, i love u man stay on top ,,, | We cant complain, he is speaking facts. it would be sad for someone to wake up to hear that one of their family members died because of violence i hope everyone hears this and take it to the point where they understand that killing isn't anything good to do because your actions always come with consequences stay blessed and safe out there!
Genuinely thank you gucci I appreciate this for the culture & the youth. Been listening to you since the baby joker frenchie & nicki n all that. Rappers gotta stop bn scared of going against what's "cool". Salute.
If u don't have any talent or skills start developing yourself now this what your helper sees first we'll rise by lifting others
✊🏾💯 What The Community needed hope this reaches the youth.
Respect it! This is real music!
This needs millions of views. Great message from the OG, Guwop.
Things to start in 2022: - working out  - investing money (crypto, stocks, savings) - ending bad habits (snoozing, gosipping, procrastinating) - planning your days - Eating healthier & learning to cook - weekly walks (in nature, no headphones/airpods) - drinking water daily (2-3 liters) - Reading at least 5-10 pages of a (e)book - Quiting drugs/alcohol (you don't need that bs) - meditating  - Giving to the less fortunates - cutting out bad friends & family  - minimalism - Learning a (remote) skill (coding, music, designing, marketing) [Screenshot this, atleast try it & any questions?

Salute to Gucci fr. He literally just earned even more respect from me. Because it takes a real man. To accept and acknowledge that he's partly to blame for the younger generation of rapper's  dissing the dead as much as they do now. So Salute to Gucci and mad respect for him.
Old Gucci vibes 🔥🔥🔥🔥

“When I was in jail I thought life was a gamble…”

Gucci is right, he set a trend with dissing dead rappers along with others which is not right, glad he using his platform to right his wrongs, because I learned a long time ago your “tongue is the most dangerous thing” on your body, I’m glad he’s bring awareness to this issue while paying homage to Dolph and Skoob; he’s stepped it up on all levels. 🔥🔥🖤
Wop
Cum thru 💪🏾🔥🔥
Growth and maturity is all I heard in this song.
