I watched this bc of Joe Bart
that island will always be an eye sore, let alone when watching videos in landscape mode
Thank you!

Hey. Any help would be appreciated. Apple does not allow comments on their official channel. (Wonder why.) My uncle is 90 years old and lives in assisted living facility. He locked himself out of his iPhone by putting in the wrong password too many times. He was excited to let me know some family news - You know how seniors are. Now the problem is that no one at Apple can unlock if for me. They want user name and password and this was set up by my wife several years ago. I no longer have access to this info. Why can't I just go into an Apple store and they can talk to my uncle, verify his identity and just unlock it for me. i am ready to give up on this company. Any suggestions. ?? Thank u.
Bring back the iPhone Mini
Apple please solve the whatsapp video cl it’s just paused when go to another apps 😢 and the calculator also doesn’t have history and the keyboard also when landscape it’s just disappeared suggestion sentence words  And after update of ios 16 can’t even customize properly the app are opening all same what did apple do 🥹🫠  Did you guys also face this issue ?
Apple not interested in hiring women....only interested in objectifying women ...thats only strategy to sell their fone.......thats the only value of this valuable  company.....pathetic company, criminal company .....doing only crimes in the name of running fone company....can go any level just to gain some power.....highest cheap  just to marketing the fone...can go any cheap just to gain some fame......World's biggest cheap company & cheap leader ever...Mentally sick
3:25 Can someone please tell me the name of the game?
Iam really impressed
Nice
First of all neither iPhone, air pods nor Apple watch have become essential in my life. As a matter of fact they are not even a PART of my life. What a waste of money. The only award Apple should get is for marketing, not the new iPhone.
Nyc
I love reading all of these comments…I see now why Apple turns the comments off on their channel
People should just keep things straight if they don't like it they can shut their mouth and can move to android, Apple never forced them to use Apple's products.
Apple is the Rolex of watches, prove me wrong
Same old trash
Tim Pool is the Steve Jobs you ordered from Wish
Should've just got a Samsung
Nice
Nice
amaizing phoes
👍
It's crazy all these "new" features coming out are old on Android I got to give it to Apple when they add a feature at least it's not buggy
that front black camera needs to go heck just put it higher and give us a full screen instead.  Lol hard pass
They still don't want to get rid of this face I'd b.s.
Listening to the airpod girl makes me wanna smash my head with a brick
They copied samsung
I'm wondering.. why 99% of comment section hate iphone 14 but they will still go and buy it? just boycott them.. charging 5x more on accessories compared to everyone else because they have the apple icon slapped on them..
i still have the iphone 12 pro max and will still be using it for years to come.
Nice video
Someone tell me how they’re worth almost 3 trillion dollars
How the dynamic island work if we apply screen guard on phone. It will look weird i think.. Also selfie camera will be filled with finger prints and everytime we may need to clean the camera before use it.
Were All Those Capitalizations intentional? 🤔e.g., Always-On display
Dorks 🤮🤡
Every year it's the same, they add a colour and call it a weird name, change the shape of something, and add a 10 years old feautre calling it the best iphone ever made, then everyone rushes to give them all their hard earned cash. The best working scam in history after religion :P
not included: the 4x jump from 12MP to 48MP for the first time ever, but of course the colors were included
The Apple Watch is worth every penny that they cost! The Apple Watch saved my life when I went into Insulin shock one early morning at 3am. All my family were asleep. I was unconscious and fell out of bed. The Watch called 911 and also contacted my son from my iPhone emergency list. The Police arrived at the house 10 mins later and found me on the floor . They obviously took me to the hospital. I’m here today because of this watch and I’m so grateful to be alive right now and to note I’m 78 years old. Thank you everyone at Apple!!!!
No USB-C and you have to buy the charging brick? Boooooo!
How can you leave out the most important feature or function on airpods which is the sou d quality. The sound quality on the old airpoids pro is so inferior to brands like jbl sony beats etc. It lacks bass louder sound etc
That pill notch they call dynamic Island is another version of the touch bar they brought to the MacBook... Very soon they will realize how ugly distracting and less useful it is.
Timebucks provide link NIce it..............
Awesome video
This method is perfectly working with my device. Great job. Keep it up.
spatial audio has been there in samsung since S8...6 years back
Lame
I’ve never been so bored in my life watching an annual Apple event
is this  is Apple CEO ? and   for how long ? 🥶
8plus and going strong baby.
Loved the watch.
DONT KNOW why iam so excited for a i phone 14 which i cannot afford
I am going to upgrade to 14 for the dynamic island!  Seriously!!!! 🤣
Every financial goal requires patience, dedication and consistent spirit knowing that investment is currently the most lucrative business in the world, BTC is positively changing people's lives. I stopped panicking about my BTC the very moment I started working with Mrs Joyce Snyder last year, his confidence and skills is on a maximum level
No new innovations.  Same old one.  Will die as Nokia or blackberry in next 2-3 years
I think that iPhone prices are too high.
Android might introduce new tech first but People forget that Apple refines the tech and makes it better.  Android still can’t compete with Apple A bionic chips and IOS blows android software out of the water.
I think people who upgrade iPhones every year forget that they are in the minority and most people don’t drop 1K plus yearly on a phone ( or sign up for payment plans etc).    Apple knows this and not every iPhone release is targeted towards people who upgrade yearly.  Releases like this are for people with older phones where it makes sense to upgrade.    Example, I got the iPhone 14 pro max pre ordered and I am coming from an 11 pro max. So this definitely feels like an  significant upgrade.
Come on Apple: still no fingerprint sensor in the iPhone Pro !? FaceID is failing in so many situations where I would have my finger on my iPhone !!
Wow what great software updates.
Is the girl a robot?
🫰🫰🫰"Always ON display".  Android:   What's next apple? What's next?!?
I love having the same phone, year after year after year...
yeah this is the same as previous lol, this phone version is mid
I am difficult to Breathe every time i see dynamic island.
7:34 That dude casually walking into the subway station and taking a seat 😂
eSim is the dumbest thing. I travel internationally and now I won’t be able to use my phone overseas. Greedy geeks
I’m glad I got the 13 mini and didn’t wait for the 14.  Going from the 11, I can actually use my phone again without being frustrated every time I use it that I can’t reach apps or certain letters when typing.  The mini is the perfect size for an average guy.  And the quality of the screen makes up for the viewing space.
The only meaningful updates I can see people actually wanting is a dock you can set your phone into that lets you use it as a desktop computer or game console. I thought that up like ten years ago and would have expected them to have made it by now.  Also If they got Siri (Artificial intelligence) to learn your habits and predict your next moves to help you complete tasks like ordering food with just one tap or things you need off Amazon or booking vacations, hotels etc. Just put all of these things on a list of options and let you choose that would be a great feature. Ai is so advanced they could have done this years ago. Predict texts you are going to send etc. I know people get freaked out by how much AI knows about them but it’s already going on in the background so why not use it.
Still lightning cable? Incremental upgrades? Meh.
It's not worth 10 weeks of work tho
GREEDGLE
Apple iPhones are getting getting way smarter
We've basically hit the top of the S curve for technological innovation in smartphones.
This is ‘far behind’ event
Perfect woke mix of presentation… apple is way ahead in wokeism but way behind in innovation
Still no music speaker on the Apple Watch…thanks alot
I don’t mind the new iPhone. But dam I’m not spitting out anothe 300 for air pod pro. I’ll keep mine for at least two years
Apple Watch and AirPods updates are more exciting this time than the iPhone
I can't imagine steve jobs presenting half this stuff. Maybe the ultra watch, but geez.
So they really just made their phone with Android features?
It can detect up to 256g impact…  So I die but the watch lives!
there’s no Black ppl 😂 .
At this point apple might was well say "We're ripping you off just because we can :)".
What a stupid opening line 😂 apple watch and AirPods are not that big of a deal
Yeah sounds good! But does it fold?🤣🤣🤣
Bring back the Touch's, I already have a phone, but what I would like is a newer MP3 player
Crash detection that still asks u to confirm u'r in a car crash b4 calling Emergency... are these ppl not clowns?  Or worse yet the emergency mode, activated by 6 rapid presses of power button, but afterwards still asks for confirmation b4 calling emergency or sending sos....  I dnt knw if these apple guys lost touch with reality or are living in a fantasy world... in an emergency (say a kidnap)  I've managed 2 tap power button 6x (at least dt cn b done covertly) u still asking me 2 look at my screen and swipe one nonsense?????
The best products ever, but we left out features for next year to make THEM the best products ever.
Still the tired old interface that makes finding icons only viable through search. And $750 for a stainless watch? I can't justify it. I like the iPhone specs, but Android is a more desirable customized interface for me. Now I now wait for Apple fans attacking me. I do have an Apple tablet and iMac though.
mbona hakuna rangi nyeusi
Would’ve been nice to have that case finding feature when my case fell out of my pocket while running a year ago…
The emergency satellite feature is good .Can t wait to see how android 14 will implement this feature
Imagine paying 1k and only receiving half the features of Samsung...
All this and they still don’t sell air pods in black
Let the memes begin. It was awesome seeing Steve Jobs daughter take a jab at this silly release.
so... nothing new! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So whats new?
People who buy Apple phones are apart of the problem on how big companies like to scam the life out of the public.
Samsung has everything this phone is trying to revolutionize
I hatr the fact that regular iphone 14 doesnt have dynamic island even after paying so much money .
After Jobs, Apple has lost its innovation lustre. Missed the old days coz the new ones just can't keep up.
I’m so glad I got the 13 mini before they phased the minis out. Best size EVER !!!
Dynamic Island? ROLF LMAO FML!   LOL
Are they not able to delay release couple of years later to deliver ground breaking iPhone designs and features 🤔 am more interested in the iwatch ultra 🙂
It's not perfect but hold on to it for iPhone 15 is coming soon so you suckers can fork out another grand or two to buy a very high-end calculator.
Anyone and I mean anyone who buys an iPhone 14 will instantly have the highest level of buyers remorse and even if they got it for free because it was a present or they won the phone,…….. The iPhone 15 is a deep secret 🤐 but I can tell anyone reading this that the 15 will be the difference of the back of the phone having a small display but not like this dumb size of a tiny, itsy bitsy notch. The notch will seem like a huge insult once seen next year in September what the massive change is going to be. Just that alone is going to make those people who still have the iPhone 6s finally grow a pair and buy the new iPhone 15. The Bionic this and the Bionic that doesn’t grab the attention of people unless you are at least 90% plus nerd certified. Anyway, DO NOT BUY this phone and save your money and just wait until the real deal comes to fruition. This would have already been out if Steve Jobs was at the throne but the guy who runs the show is too slow. That’s the guy who told Elon Musk to go pound sand when Elon personally called him and was willing to sell Tesla to Apple but mister weird nuts said yeah we’re going to take a pass on the Tesla “Opportunity”. 😂 🤣 Biggest mistake anyone has ever made in the world.
I'm youtuber  Nise video
I m a youtuber  Nise video
I m a youtuber  Nise video
Death of the queen overshadowed apples day
I have never been one to complain about a front screen notch, but wow, this one is huge and distracting.
time is up to change  your designers….
Why is the front black again?? Why did u stop making white phones???
Absolutely 10% innovation and 90% marketing
looks like the touchbar from the macbook keyboards have transferred to the dynamic island :D
Nothing new in iphone old design old camera design just change it buddy  give us some new design.
Watching this on my note 10 plus and I'm laughing at those old/new features like always on display new colours waterproof u kidding me people are so fullish to buy these same things for that amount of money 😄 🤣
Nah I’m good.
Android > apple
this nobrain wash marketing sent me to toilet
people are still using iphones?
Wow….
If y’all out of ideas just say that
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.      !.
International orange, nice color…  Anything else?
This is the most awkward launch ever. Dynamic island is a joke. Always on display this should have been in Iphone 8 . This is just ridiculous. When they specifically name there watch faces. Crash recorder, how many people are crashing?
Nobody uses APPLE in the safe space town of Chillingbourne. 🚫🍎
Always on display really Motorola phones had that since 2016 lol.. apple needs to come out with better ideas.  Why it feels apple it's years behind android
Wow! I can get a retrospective estimate of when I ovulated!
honestly i’m still in love with my iphone 11 pro, im not giving it up until it breaks 🤣 every year is kinda the same but with tweaks😒 i’m not upgrading my iphone til there’s an edge or fold💁🏻‍♀️
$1,000 for the same product.
Wow if theyre gonna do marginal updates like this people are gonna be able to hold onto there iPhone for a decade or more!   THATS THE TRUE *GROUND BREAKING* ANNOUNCEMENT!
Yawn* oh sorry I didn't realize 4 year old tech was "ground breaking" apple truly has become full of it self, hopefully they quickly go the way of big blue
Okay how about the battery life🥴🤣
Take my money!!!
Thanks for the awesome reveal, dropping a reaction video on ma channel.
im good with my flip phone thanks. no one will look as cool as me when they hang up their phones.
Go back to the auditorium..
Nothing new now give us  us your f-ing money
Why are they going to confuse the consumer on the iPod pro and Pro 2 they look the same.  Lot of people are going to get scammed
These presentations are hilarious.
Apple died with jobs.
I will have to give Apple a try. 👍👍👍👍
1:20 anyone know what movie this is?
Its always 4 things screen quality durability battery and   CAMERAS
💀💀💀
I am beyond poor at these prices. At least my android which costs 10x less can do most of these things
Looks like the iPhone 13. I haven’t upgraded phones for at least 5 years and finally doing so when I got my very first iPhone last year. Which was the iPhone 13 pro max and planning on keeping the same phone for several years as well. I don’t hate apple, they in my opinion have the best looking phone in the market. But they always release the same looking phone over and over again, with a few added on features. Selling them for absurd prices, and everyone flocks to them like it’s the best thing they’ve ever seen and buying them in droves. Like it’s the toilet craze back during the corona virus outbreak.
Not wasting my money. Nothing really new to pay crazy amount of cash. I have the 12pro and super happy. But I bet my left nut. Apple will release a new software that will slow all previous models right down.
I just bought airpods pros the other week, then they go and drop new ones 😭😭😭
lame. get an android people. whats new or better with this phone??? always on display? useless battery waster. smh. All that surgical steel why you taking needed medical supplies and putting them in this stupid phone. I guess apple hates surgeries. which means apple hates hospitals. which means apples hates people. which means apples hates your mom. i knew it all along. screw you apple.
Who came up with the name " dynamic island " ?
Apple is selling the old iPhone 13 again but with New name .... that is the case
I see iPhone 11 or 12 or 13 !! No thing new!!
Iphone 11 = 12 = 13 = 14 ‼🤮🤮🤮
Jump suit w/ white boots. That’s my girl 👧🏻
SEVEN-HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE DOLLARS FOR THAT UGLY OF A WATCH?
Orange lady bad
Iphones have ruined the world
Other smartphones have no ugly notch for years, we have to step up our game guys. Aright make the notch, virtually even bigger and force people to press on it on the very top of the screen where you can't reach it if you are holding it.  Genius.....  Would really like to know how many people Steve Jobs would let go over this.
Let's sell a phone without a charger
Apple 😢 gets a thumbs down.  Hired some new speakers, polished their talking points and that’s about it. No reason to leave the Apple phone you have now or the Apple Watch you currently have.  This company has become stagnant for far too long.
So iPhone 14 pro has the dynamic island but not the base iPhone 14. Honestly nothing has changed since the x apart from the camera and the shape.
I am underwhelmed and I am still using a Samsung Galaxy J3 Prime
Damn
i wonder why they are talking about keeping cost low, when ideally they should be marketing it as a luxury device.
It’s funny how many people think android is better. Rushing a glitchy feature to the market is ground breaking
nice video, please how can i order mine from Africa-Ghana
😂😂😂😂
.... And still, the same damn phone year after year. Apple adding features that Android and Samsung have had for years will certainly excite the apple crowd.
Buy our new phone that does.... exactly what the last one did...WAIT we have different colors :D
Always on display, LOL
What a joke
😍😍
What a gimmicky feature to cover the camera with more and call it "Dynamic Island".  It's truly laughable..😂😂😂😂
If they say “this is the best iPhone we have ever created” one more time, I might stab a new born child.
Anyone nepali here i am really excited to watch iPhone 14 unboxing video 🤣 Don't have aaukat to buy yet.
R.i.P Queen 👑 elizabeth
These silicone valley npcs sound more cultish every year
The SIM card tray is such a horrible change. There are cases where you need to take the physical SIM card out with your number to change your Apple ID password after breaking your phone. Now you won’t be able to anymore
Apple hasn’t made a good iPhone since the iPhone 8 plus
Again  - no touch id (faceid is good but most of the time not working eg when on the desk beside my workstation i dont wanna pickup my phone to stare at it) - cinema mode cap 30mfps - 4k cap 60 fps - no slowmo - camera still facing out (can be used for bigger battery) - design and haptic still better on my iphone xs (Same design haptic was better on iphone 4 and 5) Maybe next year
😂😂😂Same as 13😂😂😂
Imagine buying crapple phones.
Apple: Introducing the NEW Dynamic Island! Apple Youtubers: Best thing ever!🎉
Overpriced overhyped hipster garbage
Wrong move iphone developers. The goal is to remove the notch, and no more of those water drop, mole, pill shape. You did the same thing. That pill shape and it turns big when its animating. Also, The pill shape is bigger than other android devices.  Under display camera is still the best. Kudos goes to Samsung. Not to mention they have folding devices
joz like woz.......................nooooooooooooo
Android phones have been using always on display for years
Everyone was wrong when they said they will raise the prices
जो सुंदर 👀आंखें मेरा कमेंट पढ़ रही हैं 🙂भगवान उनको तरक्की दें और उनके💏💏 माता-पिता💏💏 की लंबी उम्र करें🙏🙏
No need this is business advertisement.... All peoples foolish omg
The comments from current IPhone owners are hilarious. You can fool me 13 times but not this one Timmy . 😂
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Honestly, I’m done with Apple, they are too far from what people want
I was so excited for the AirPod Pros 2 now I’m just depressed
The magical dialogue "the best iphone we've ever made "
So they are just 6 years back ahh🙄
Idiots keep buying this crap. Iphone 11 pro max is still relevant 🤫
Apple want the upgrade to not sink too much into the old series, not because they can't, not because they have principles but because of strategy. If they followed the Android trajectory which was so fast and so significant in upgrading their products they would not win. That's why Apple makes their upgrade duration slower than Android, plus they can still sell older products.
Always on display wow it's nothing that existed like 7 years ago if not more😂
Feels like apple is going stale and boring, nothing exciting. I started with the first iphone and continue to use apple but they have nothing new. Not even a true redesign.  Big dissapointment.
Oo
I remember when apple was cool and innovative unfortunately not any more 😔 up to samsung to now to make things you'd want.
I’m getting tired of every new IPhone being the same…      (Commented on IPhone 13 Pro Max)
Is the screen tougher ?
One of the  best thing. About dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves some thing .he always respect us the audience and his team and he is always polite in all his videos.we congrulate ourseleves on this achievement .more to come and everthingsto come .
Lame 😒
🤔 but can this apple take a picture of the moon?
LOL Always-On-Display like it's a new thing
Mary-Ann Rau has the most irritating voice I’ve ever heard…. My god
Every iphone launched..they say...this is the best iphone we've ever created....what about me..who is watching 7plus ad and planning to buy🥲
OMG this is hard to watch , I have to skip and still feel like wasting my time . There nothing new about this , every damn years keep recycling the same design , same product,  this company is doom with no talents,  nothing new , selling people same old stuff and even their talking points is the same , what a lame company.
"5 Gourgeous colours"... looks at the colours and meh... nothing special.
We also integrated all peripherals, no matter how significant they may be, to only work for this particular cellphone. So, it's highly advised that you throw away all of your old (old being about a year ago) accessories and buy our overpriced crap. Thank you!
The most predictable keynote we've ever made! 🙄
I'm struggling to see anything that would convince me to spend £1,000-1,500 ti replace the phone I have.
So the only new thing with the new Apple Watch is I can track my period I don’t get. Cool
Apple products are just fancy items... nothing innovative 💡 If someone calls Always-on display an innovation..... then it's unbelievably shocking 🙄
I nearly spat out my water when apple tried to make having last year’s chip in the 14 a good thing.
I think apple is starting to become tone deaf to its consumers. The most creative this is the dynamic island? Everything else just a meh….
Thank god the volume controls are on the new AirPods Pro :,)
I dont know man, this looks just like FIFA 2021 dude
FYI. The prices only remained the same in the USA. The prices in Europe are NOT the same as last year.  In The Netherlands the prices increased between €110 and €290, compared to last year.   iPhone 14 128GB - €1019 (+110) 256GB - €1149 (+120) 512GB - €1409 (+150)  iPhone 14 Plus 128GB - €1169,- 256GB - €1299,- 512GB - €1559,-  iPhone 14 Pro 128GB - €1329,- (+170) 256GB - €1459,- (+180) 512GB - €1719,- (+210) 1TB      - €1979,- (+240)  iPhone 14 Pro Max 128GB - €1479,- (+220) 256GB - €1609,- (+230) 512GB - €1869,- (+260) 1TB      - €2129,- (+290)
At least you guys are FINALLY getting an always-on display...welcome to 2010.
Well done for the hard work this year. Looking forward to the next one.
that's only a software update , no need for iphone 14
I'll save you some time, they made the same product but with a higher price.
the person in yellow looks and sounds like an AI robot
Should maintance the mini series with dynamic island,i would buy it,as my 2nd phone..
IPhony14 nice! M gonna buy it after 10 years! And the 24 version would still have the same feature
That lady in yellow had the best presentation
I feel like Apple I'm so premium
I'm so bored of Apple they are the best however nothing is new it's just updated 🙄
100% marketing, 0 innovation. Had always on display 10 years ago on my Samsung Galaxy s2 btw..
I don’t see any big difference between iPhone 11,12,13 & their pro model and minis except the length, size and some little bit functional change depending upon model.  Similarly, iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 pro goes the same.  Being a iPhone eco costumer, we want not little amount of newness in product but completely new product. New in model, new in features, new in their functionality and their performance have to be differentiating factors among their series but all 11, 12, 13 and 14 follows same pattern.However, the company implemented same model even in iPhone 14  so I always get confused that am I carrying iPhone 14 or iPhone 13 .   I wasn’t expecting this from iPhone 14 model . 👎👎👎
No thanks chief, I will stick to my Samsung, and would have to Blackberry and Nokia if they were making good phones.
APPLE GOT IT ALL WRONG THIS TIME
Blah, blah, blah! Same phone different year. 😏
The free engraving is what's really sold me on the AirPods Pro 2.
and yet another "something"  that I don't need
Meaningless meaningless meaningless......
Hard pass, waiting for no notch(dynamic island lol!!) usb-c with fastcharging. USB-C was a no brainer and they managed to screw that up some how..
eSim only makes the iPhone 14 a bust for me.  Consumer Cellular does not support eSim.  So all of the older generation using Consumer Cellular, in order to save money due to fixed income, have just been given the ol Apple JackBoot. 😬 Discrimination against the older generation begins.
Lol it detects when women ovulates 🤣 wow. Detecting g force by saying it’s for accidents 🤣 its more for detecting how hard you dropped it 😂
This is soooo booooring, just going to wait til some utuber makes a video about it
I have a question , can someone in another country use iPhone 14 as it has no SIM CARD???????
I feel brainwashed
Thanks Apple for explaining 'always-on-display'....I've had a Samsung for the last 5 years
this phone looks ok,i think im gonna buy an iphone 12 (first one ever)
The airpod lady has the most annoying voice in existence
i ve used ip3.5,4,4s,5s,5se,6,8+,x,12, n 13. iphones that i hv used were all good for the time but it seem that apple is now lack of ideas to stay a few years ahead of others.
i do not trust a man whose hips are wider than his shoulders
Best iPhone ever created lol. All you do is add a new feature. I’m sticking to my 5 year rule. No upgrading for 5 years.
Will they gradually move to a hole punch as they realise dead screen space is actually not desirable?
So it’s basically iphone 11 but the notch is even more annoying and airpods are.. just airpods we just made it sound cooler anndd finally the apple watch.. with a brighter screen
You are not upgrading phone but just only enhancing you presentation slideshow 😂
bible dynasty 0 seconden geleden Apple, is one of thee biggest companies on the world, who has managed to convince  (I rather not say manipulate), millions of customers to buy a phone, they really don't need, by offering them continously an upgraded phone. And with 'phone' it is usually the software. The greatest convincer of mankind, to move them to buy the latest of their upgraded phones they actually don't really need. Not to mention the millions of young and teenagers who press their parents into buying the latest phones, just to stay 'TIMEFUL' for their generation. Each time, there is an upgraded phone, millions flock to give Apple almost a 1000 dollar to the company. Talking about a formula that has worked so well.. causing them to be one of thee richest companies on the face of the earth. This is one of the greatest financial PULL-OFF's but on the other hand the greatest VAINLESS Pursuit to give a company such an ammount of money for just some upgrades. Ultimately they become richer and richer and customers POORER AND POORER>
Aaaaand still no inscreen finger print...
Apple is so good at pretending features the competition has had for 7 years are new, innovative and exciting. I'm so glad Steve Jobs is dead so he doesn't have to see what Apple has become
LMAO
Lol they never had AOD before... lol
How mach pro i want to sell???
Can apple event movie maker make a fully feature film please
Apple fans be like... OMG... that's extraordinary 😱
“International orange”
“High contrast international orange” come on with the names of colors
Dynamic Island sounds so interesting hahaha but I do like how they outsmart the big hole as a notification center. And wow. Only e-SIM. No SIM tray anymore 🤔
Who watched this video instead of watching a 2 hour video?
Budget i phone 😅 19999 inr
Is this a spoof?always on display "ground breaking features" yeah 5 years ago...
Old design again fk u apple
Legends: who can't afford but still watching 😂😂
Making chutia is an art, apple wins hands down
Still a notch?  Jeesh….
All same design
Pro pro pro!!!!
Apple: "With a larger display you can see more text or larger text!" 💁‍♀ Imagine if other companies also explained the obvious like they are teaching it to children. Ikea: "With a larger sofa you can fit more friends or larger friends"💁‍♂
That satellite transmission thingamajig is major! Needs to be available worldwide
"For the first time" every iphone launch
well, i think its time for me to ditch my flip 4 and get a 14 pro max
Thank you Apple for these amazing new products. Finally time to upgrade to the IPhone 13 Mini. ❤️
Hah! 36 hours on the apple watch. I get 36 days on my garmin!
I am so confused 🤔 My samsung phone from 5 years ago has "dynamic island"
Dynamic Island will lead to lenses getting smudged 24/7...be ready for the blurry 🤳 selfies
APPLE; It's very cool and my respects, but your iPhone is looking for people in the mountains when there are people on the street or in the hospital who really need help, Apple you don't want to because they won't let YOU
The funny thing is that Apple is learning from fake Apple products LMAO🤣
Not buying an Apple Watch until video chat is available. Especially with the bigger version out now
Um…. Why am I not surprised? A part of the updates to the iOS I definitely don’t see any magnificent change than the 12s and 13s… I expected more
Apple releasing iPhone year after year.. it kind of feels like a bug fix.. problems from the previous phones.. nothing new just fixing problems
APPLE; It's very cool and my respects, but your iPhone is looking for people in the mountains when there are people on the street or in the hospital who really need help, Apple you don't want to because they won't let YOU
Basically apple is making you pay for the tracking mechanisms so that they can study and monitor everything about you from the number of steps you walk a day, how many beats your heart beats, your oxygen levels, your blood pressure, your ID, your spending habits, the number of times you text someone, who you text, who you come into contact everyday, contact tracing, what you search on the internet, how you spend, where you go, your social media accounts, etc…..  These gimmicks are government tracking devices.  I wouldn’t be surprised if apple and google aka CIA are building profiles of each and every one us.  The funny thing is they make you pay for these overpriced items.
Too much bull 💩 marketing. The Ugliest Punch hole ever. Common sense is not so innovative anymore, Apple?
They need to stop pushing fitness+ I don’t know anybody who wants it.
Looking forward to my iPhone 13 being slowed and fcked with a new “update”
Always on display with a oled display..risky
Dynamic island? That doesn't need to be a feature. Just say you've reduced the size of the notch 😂
after jobs die android is now 100% better than apple.. apple keeps recycling old phones repaint them add small updates and resell it again
I swear I have watched this launch before? oh yeh, at the last launch...
Dynamic "Island" my a$$. That's an entire "Ugly Continent" up there. Epic disappointment. Design fail.
Noooo I just wanted one of the phones to be pink ill just upgrade to the 13 then
still no always on display on the iphone 14 Pro and iphone 14s in 2022 when the technology has been around for YEARS !!! ... c'mon... no alternate way like finger print to unlock.... no FOLD / FLIP... do some INNOVATION rather then ranting on about the things nobody ever sees - NANOMETER on the CHIP or the HIGH G accelerometer..!! So somebody buys this apple watch because if his body hits a 256G force in a car crash and he is crushed to pulp, somebody could record the EXACT TIME it happened from his apple watch ???!!
Adaptive sound has been an amazing technology all the way since galaxy S4. If it weren't for the amazing apple silicon inside, iPhones would be long gone. Well not gone but loosing a ton or market share.
REMOVING SIM TRAYS IS 100% DEAL BREAKER.  When traveling internationally it is often required to buy a cheap local SIM to get cell service!  I also swap back and forth between my nice phone and a burner phone when traveling to reduce theft risk!  This alone is a total 100% deal breaker for me.  I travel internationally every year, and it's already very difficult to get a sim in a foreign country in a foreign language -- imagine trying to buy and troubleshoot an e-sim in a foreign language!  Also, I regularly swap between my main iphone 13 pro and an old iphone 7 with no apps to "technology detox".
1tb of beautiful Pro res video, and all night to get it off the phone using usb2 speed lighning port... Wonderful.
boringggggggggggggggg
So, except 14 pro version model,everything stays the same..oh yeah,pixels are bit bigger,lol..nice work iphone
All the pro features but still no way to get files of an iPhone fast? That’s like having a trash can that doesn’t have a lit
Love you CNET ❤️
Still my iphone 12 shall rule✌🏼.
Lol can’t fool with same phone every year 😂
The notch still outdated
2017: eww a notch  2022: wow a dynamic island 😍
I'll sell them water, Pa, you watch
“Best technology” “first time ever” “best ever” “next generation ” are the phrases that they use…… for me it’s just “blah” and “meh”
Every year new iphone releases and every year i wish to get one but fails 😂 because of shortage of money.
"we're introducing low power mode" .... "36h of batterly life" ...what ?! ..do they know multi-color touch-screen always on watches that last +1 week (and solar charging sorry) already exist ?
still no charger
Lol I bought 13 pro max like a month ago
I see nothing worth upgrading my 13 pro max. It is a damn good phone and I’ll stay with my 13pmx. However, I want that Apple Watch Ultra RIGHT NOW!
I spilled my cofee and felt back from my chair the very moment they mentioned "Dynamic island". Outrageous! Man..you can land an airplane on that thing.. Do you have any idea what does that mean? I guess camera under display will be implemented after 5 more years on an iphone.
I am old enough to remember the first iPhone (that's sad) technology going too fast for me.
2x noice cancellation *laughs in tinnitus*
I hope that this life should be available for me to use that Brillion smart phone (Apple).
BLAH BLAH BLAH  " They will keep this OVER RATED, OVER PRICED CRAP UP until ... Elon Musk launches better and MORE affordable products so as to permanently cripple Apple - PERIOD. They are scared shitless. " ~ WAIT FOR IT ~
Ima skip this year nothing new or exciting. Hopefully next year
Does anyone else feel like apple fell off after the iPhone 6 / iPhone 7? From then onwards it felt like apple weren't improving the iphone as much anymore and prices started to get silly. Then after the iPhone X the naming conventions were just annoying skipping 9 then all named a variation of iphone xs max pro just made it hard to keep up with which were the new ones and which were suppose to be better. Watching this it seems that iphone have gone backwards with their phone aesthetics.
Bruh they literally rebranded iPhone 13 to iPhone 14 like nothing extra
Finnaly a reason to shift to android
So no new innovations? I feel sad 😞
I love watching those things which I can't afford...😅
"samsung Z flip  ad  pop-up" while watching apple event
Come on Apple, you can do better than this.. Since iPhone 6S, no proper phone created...
Super!
I came to see what ape stole from Android now, im gonna ask my android user friends how old this tech is lol
Until i get a week of battery life on apple watch i'm not buying it
I'm very disappointed that Apple did not change their charging port from lightning to USB-C.
"Dynamic island" but island is in the size of  Russian on globe
It's Tim Apple.
Woohooo, paying full price for a 2022 phone and getting last years phone is tight! (only the pros get new chipset)
Meh, only apple fanboys need the latest. For the rest of us, they are all the same. lol
The notch is still an eyesore.
Apple is badly missing Steve.. they couldn't deliver single new innovative product after him..
I'd rather have a $300 Vivo n have $800 still in my pocket lol.   Not to mention Vivo y 33 s has a 50 mega pixel camera lol
Anything about lossless on the new AirPods?
so basically nearly nothing new... its getting really boring. I event don't watch the keynotes no more
This one has been.. meh. The ‘Dynamic Island’ is somewhat creative, atleast the Apple identity is still there. 48MP camera might be a huge upgrade especially considering how brilliant current iphones with 12MP shoots images. The addition of the always on display is late but I think they have a trick up their sleeve. The normal 14 is very underwhelming but hey I guess it can capture images slightly better. The addition of the plus line is really good for people who want the large screen but not pay the pro tax. Watch 8, incremental upgrade nothing amazing. Watch ultra, pretty great for people who want a durable apple watch but the cost is frightening. Airpods pro 2, idk I don’t even use earphones but sounds like a fairly decent update.
Absoluty AWFUL design choice. The pill is even more distracting than the notch was!  Apple's design team need to be sacked!
Phone really has nothing new, not worth any upgrade
Update like toothpaste.
Not impressed on Apple event, same old same old, no new innovation.  They just have the same old things and tweeted it a little to make you guys buy it!  I felt that after Steve Job had passed away, there was no new innovation on the product lines...they keep milking the same old stuff.
Is me or did jaws remind you of the tech guru Harold finch from persons of interest he sounded and looked like him  I kept wanting here him to say mr Rees bring me my I phone 14 pro max features are insane will make my video shoots so much better can’t wait to get mine
Queue Island Boy memes..
Lol 14 pro is nothing but the 13 pro max
I thought the 12 and the 13 where the best iPhones they have ever made.  That line is getting old.
Apple is trashing BEATS and they're deaf im customers feedback as they didn't improve on BEATS headphones as features are near to get outdated and the fact that they don't offer wireless charging for BEATS... 👎👎
I missing Steve job , terrible presentation ,I'm sorry apple
Yup. I’ll be sticking with my 13 pro at least another year. Lmao.
All of their innovation went towards their computers
Hopefully the don't have the static noise problem again, with their software solution of making ANC worse for everyone. Finally, volume control from the airpods themselves! They even show up in find me, even better!
still lacking in beauty of the hardware design.. only huawei can give satisfaction to  it's customers when it comes to design and latest technology.. if only google is with them...
Sorry but this new iPhone didn’t impress me at all. I will remain using my iPhone 12pro until i see something different in new iPhone.
Bad phone 👙👙👙👃👃👃👃👃👃
Why should I upgrade from 13 pro max 🤔
Why should I upgrade from 13 pro max 🤔
lol more bricks from apple. how the F people keep these 6.7 inch phones in their pocket.  phones should be under 5.5 inch size.
APPLE IS A JOKE!
They sound like they made it first 😂😂😂.... huhh
Everything looks the same... Bring something new
no
The competition is eating apple iPhone. They have better phones, with more fixtures, better cameras and colors to choose from.
From iPhone 10 to iPhone 14 only their announcements got improved
and now you wont hear the stabber coming in the subway.
as you can see, they cant claim no child labor was used in getting the raw materials for these apple iphone techs.
11:34 What’s up with Tim’s legs😂🤣
iphone 6s front face camera has autofocus also, how is this new?
Everyday we stray futher and futher from Iphone 6s...
Is the crash detection for when all the mRNA heart attacks begin?
Phones being sold at 999+ and 1099+ is a Joke. This needs to change.
Dynamic island??? Always on display????? I woke up to this???? Hahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhahah! Let me guess,  isheep loyals gonna claim its a revolution? Hahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahah! Glad i jumped ship from the iphone xs back then.
When I get my new Apple Watch I’m definitely getting apple care and all the good stuff this time around lol
Still no type C charging and data transfer… wtf
I’m just waiting to when we can just update our phones for the new features rather than buying new phones every year
People still buy it lol
Blame my small hand, hardly hold mini with case firmly, so ditch out case completely
dynamic island and Always on display, wow they really think their customers are living under a rock. look at the top chin in 2022.
All these robotic presenters are freaking me out. Goes to show we are all being brainwashed to be like robots such as Mark Z and Biden.
They need to come out with better colors. I’m glad that they get rid off the mini iPhone , That was a joke. They need to come out with more and better fixtures. I wait for the next iPhone, hope they come out with more fixtures and better color line.
"dynamic island" = we couldn't get rid of that part so we are gonna called it an island lol
Apple touts their tough phones but my glass on the back of my 13 pro begs to differ.
Not a fan of the pro colors or the new cases this year. They seem kinda boring and bland.
R they serious 🧐?!?!
And 15 year's on Bulgarian market, still no have BULGARIAN menu 😂😂😂 very disrespectful to Bulgarian APPLE fan's 👍🏻
When will a president get pissed off for apple charging 900$+ to get 1 TB storage? Or better yet, the new phones get another 1 mega pixel, and that is what apples WWDC events are made of?
They made the “dynamic island” to release the infinite display iPhone next year, charge much more and thus recover their investment since they didn’t increase the price this year, this year they’ll prob not make much profits or they’ll even loose profits due to the global inflation that’s happening rn lol
I remember a time where Apples keynotes where mind-blowing and amazing to watch. Now they are just... Meh.
More cosmetic updates again. They're fresh out of new ideas.
nothing new, only empty words, you are no longer able to come up with anything new
Ill keep my mini until i can't use it any longer :(
Does anyone know how much ram does the new 14 pro max has apple didn’t mention it on there show
Ground breaking features...lololol
Always on display made possible by new technologies 🤣🤣
KLAUSE SQWARB of the WEF would be soo Proud of his new toys to enslave todays modern peasants
The Tesla phone will put the iPhone out of business.
My dad ran over my AirPods. Thankfully, I decided to wait. Just wished they had it in multiple colors.
I have zero doubt in my mind that the woman who introduced the airpods is a robot
for sure, they fooled all peoples over the world
“Designed to last “ really a bluffing statement
At the end its just another phone they are trying to sell you year after year.... stop falling for it..
Why does everyone in this video look so lifeless? It's like they're all robots.
I don’t want a 6.1 inch phone, where is the smaller option? No type C is very disappointing, and also an instant deal breaker for me.  Also, give us always on display on any Oled model please, you’re already YEARS late to that party. (It’s a feature I had back in 2016 on my S7)
What a joke 😆 🤣 😂
2 years ago i bought a phone for little under 100$....still has everything i need lol...
A new iphone 13+1 model for settelite and crash detection neither a16 chip added in not pro version, no wonder why comments not allowed in apple events
I don’t like noise canceling so I’m still sticking with the og AirPods
That's why Apple turn off comments on their youtube channel 🤣😂
iPhone, just like a car with only one pedal.  Thanks Tim Apple!
Honestly speaking, their innovation died along with Steve jobs. Apple products have become boredom.
Mothafucka i dam near caught a stroke when I heard “apple watch ultra, only $799..”
I didn't know always on display is groundbreaking feature. I thought it was a basic thing.
Sooo it took 12 minutes to say new colors better graphics and good camera🤣
What's the point of spending so much on a damn phone when they don't even provide a charger?
They introduced always on display in 14 next they will introduce customised aod on 15 . What a joke
Always on display was incorporated into android phones approx 7yrs ago man!
Marketing is awesome. They can put a punch hole at the center of the screen and call it the "Center Eye" and it'll suddenly be an awesome and cool feature :D
airpod lady is pretty
funny apple haha
A dynamic island that isn’t dynamic enough to disappear.
5:27 feels like a cult
Surprised they didn't come up with their own special magical name for Always on display
Im from Samsung flagship phoned and I can ay for now that I love the Iphone Pro Max. Better performance and quality I love to have and feel.
Tim said a lot and nothing at the same time...
Autofocus for the first time ever..  😂😂
I’ll keep my XR the new phone is meh as usual😂😂😂
Dynamic island MFS Apple:yeah we've done it
iPhone 20 is when we will see the iPhone fold and flip
The person presenting the AirPods sounded like a first gen robot. Absolutely trying too hard or not at all. Not sure.
You forget about the Apple Watch SE 2
So instead of a notch that I really don’t even notice, you’ve created a dark island in the display… 🤨  Steve would be rolling in his grave
How can that guy be so serious without even laughing while introducing the so called DYNAMIC ISLAND 😂😂😂
Here is the summary:   Apple Watch with big display  AirPods pro rereleased as a version 2 iPhone 13 rereleased as 14 and 14 pro by creating unnecessary narrow screen space on top.
5:00 Dafuq is wrong with her. Girl, lower your fake enthusiasm.
Ultra Apple Watch for 799 ? Wtf 😂 I can buy a good phone for that
So , what , basically , still got notch or does not has now .🤦‍♂️
If you had the iPhone 12 it might be worth the upgrade, but nothing new to see,. Just get an android ha,. $799 for a watch to loll
Personal Spatial Audio... Sooooo.... What Creative and Sony have had for years?
I have the 11 max and really thought the 14 would be worth it but STILL not 😢
So airpods 2 is still the same? Damn
Imagine clicking on this video just to post a condescending comment about how you're going to be sticking with whatever iteration you currently have, as though it makes you superior to everyone who is choosing this year to upgrade their phones. It's hilarious because these comments show up in videos for every single iPhone, which just means that everyone thinks everyone else is an idiot for upgrading until it's the year they want to upgrade, then it's ok to do so all of a sudden. Do people not realize the days when each new generation of a certain phone meant the inclusion of some insane, bleeding-edge tech are over? Keeping your phone for 2-4 years doesn't make you special anymore, it just means you're doing what 90% of everyone else is doing. I wish these comment sections included more discussion about the actual phones themselves instead of being a place where people sit around jerking themselves off and questioning why everyone else isn't still using an iPhone 8 like they are.
Hopefully iPhone 15 will introduce the "NEW" USB-C connector.. lol
will skip this year again
How far apple has fallen. Steve jobs died for this
so the "notch" got a fancy new name, the DYNAMIC ISLAND...and the "Always On display" WOW..
MY GODD!! THIS COMPANY IS JUST KEEP RIP PEOPLE'S MONEY OFF!! FROM YEAR TO YEAR, VERSION TO VERSION, THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE UPGRADE ON THIS DEVICE!! YEAH, YOU ALL ARE APPLE DORK!! OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' DORK BRAIN OUT!!
I have an iPhone 12 and Apple Watch 3 and airpod pro and after watching this I don’t have a feel to upgrade
iPad , What iPad ? Every year “ This is the best iPhone we ever made “ I had been using always on display since 2017 with dynamic wallpaper background download from Galaxy Themes store FOC
Imagine Apple saying “This isn’t the best iPhone we created, but we did our best.”
"The iPhone front camera has Autofocus FOR THE FIRST TIME"??? Really?  You iPhone peeps have been paying premium for a phone with front camera that doesn't autofocus automatically all this while?
Years 2022:  Watch and smartphone price are equal $799!!!
They don't want to remove the notch ...so they called it dynamic island hahah
I'll tell you from the experience, these displays won't last long with the notch cutout and AOD... So disappointed..
Ill buy the new iphone when they put hologram in it🥱🥱🥱
alll i wanted was to see the charge port
I can’t believe no mention on when iOS 16 is coming out
Touch control on the new airpods is something I assumed the original airpods pro would have
Apple did it again! They "invented" sooooo many new features. Innovators...
I am really impressed...by how all the presenters made the 'new features' sound exciting
Yawn
I'm proud such a garbage company just pushing people's to bye your garbage
Revealed in 12 min + 2 unskippable 10 seconds ads
Must consooooooom, must buy new phone….new phone has new useless feature I’ll never need….must consoooom….wait for iPhone 15 and then consoooom again.
I found nothing new except dynamic island 🤣🤣
So instead of finally nixing the notch, they decided to animate it and give it a goofy name. I must be a hardcore Apple sheep cuz I’m kinda diggin it 🤷🏽‍♂️
I would think if your apple watch detected a 256 g force impact you might have bigger problems...
So y’all Bring back a Phone (IPhone 11) and ReEdit it basically?
The most revolutionary announcement is the fact that they will stay at the same price. 🤯🤯🤯
It’s Over. I am now declaring Samsung Inc. As The Champion. Apple isn’t doing nothing.
As a Guy who doesn't crash his car or have a period I am happy that I don't need to upgrade from my Series 7 apple watch LOL/ Really don't see any viable reason to upgrade... That Apple Watch Ultimate though is a beauty.
Dynamic island...yeah right
Dynamic Island? LOL more like: we still can't hide the notch.
Y’all putting things out that should have been here, what specifically have y’all done to make PEOPLE INTRESTED IN SPENDING THEIR MONEY THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SAVE ALREADY!???? Smh. That’s all I’m gonna Say.
Iphone 14 pro has almost no upgrade and kind of trash...
Nah, I'll stick to my iPhone 13. The only thing I'm looking forward is iOS 16 update.
Apple out of innovation and nothing to offer🤮🤮
How do Apple make such a perfect phone every year. Hats off to them. Look at Google, Samsung, they are struggling even with their main component like SOC and battery life.
So now new terminology for notch is dynamic island 😅
if the island also display the volume slider that would be pretty nice
Always on display? Seriously? Your about 7 years late, Apple
Samsung called.  They would like to have their 2019 technology back from Apple.
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
A screen borrowed from samsung or lg
Sorry what’s the use case here - why do we need a surgical grade steel on a phone ?
USB C
Always on display is "Made possible by a new number of technologies" ?!?😂😂 When did apple start doing comedy?
The expected  - best iPhone ever & most immersive sound exp for AirPods
my samsung has had these features for the past few years, so why even change
Iphones usually only last 5 major IOS updates, but the apple watch only lasts half of that so i wouldn't tre it like i'm buying a traditional rgged watch
!!!!!!BORING!!!!!!
I just want different color AirPod pros preferably blacklol
Is there an Apple Watch that I can text and make calls over Bluetooth??
Did anyone know what’s the meaning of last scene in the event, i mean the woman who shows up 🤷🏻‍♂️?!
Nothing special about this phone, probably I will update new phone in 5 years
No USB-C port is a MAJOR FAIL! No interest in ANY 2022 product crippled with an oddball port from 2012.
Same crap!!!
My IPhone 12 mini stopped charging. It is scratch less, sparsely used for just over an year. Apple wants me to pay INR 40k for replacement instead of repairing it. This is just extortion. I have multiple apple devices but after this experience I will never buy or recommend one. Will complain through Govt consumer redressal system.
So what would actually make you upgrade?
No USB-C port is a MAJOR FAIL! No interest in ANY 2022 product crippled with an oddball port from 2012.
The Watch Ultra and island iPhone were the most interesting thing tbh. I sold my XR and Watch 6 at the start of the year and moved entirely to Android because Apple just didn't feel the same anymore as when I started with a 3GS (I only skipped 7 and 8 but had every gen since 3GS, period XD). At least they are doing a pretty good job with the wide-hole-punch situation, its pretty neat and kinda smart. The bigger display on the Watch Ultra is great for ppl with visual impairment like me. But... there aint anything "really new", yknow? It might just be me feeling cynical, but aside fro ever-growing camera bumps etc., Apple has hardly changed - if at all - since almost a decade.
Finally I can buy 7 plus
One thing that I havent seen anyone bring up: If you are expected to directly touch the "dynamic island" wouldn't that constantly smudge the front camera? I feel like you would constantly need to wipe off your camera
I think I’ll stick with my iPhone 13
just think why you dont wear gloves when climbing a snow mountain and with big jackets, if so, where will you put on your watch then? the ad is missing that part..
The biggest thing from this event was Mary-Ann’s hips…dayum
looks like they updated internals but kept the same design since the iphone 12.
What? No new IPads?
still no usb type c...
still no fingerprint reader? hard pass
dynamic island, always on display, and better camera and thats it.
Does it make phone calls? Or do I just stare at it?
Nah I’ll keep my 13 pro
If their innovation is diminishing, they need to start driving the price down for production to make it cheaper and sell more. I buy apple stocks periodically but will reduce my purchase soon. I can't see them growing much anymore
Dynamic island 😂 🤣🤣🤣 can't stop laughing
Funny how I can do everything I need on my 8plus. I’ll come back when 16 comes out maybe I’ll upgrade then
Wow.. glad Apple finally has AOD and low power mode. Bravo apple for catching up with Samsung old existing features. Now hurry up and bring multi task and customization to your iPhone so we can finally have some good competition hahah. Until next time. Samsung Knight on deck (samsung note long time user). Peace.
With the expandable black hole
What about charging port? No one is talking about it.
simply hated all the news Apple had bring to its products
Nah Still keeping my iphone 12 pro
Apple please for the love of god come up with some cool watch faces. I mean it seems like you have Disney license so why not expand on that with Marvel and Star Wars or The Simpsons would be really cool
dafuq is up with the old mans legs? 🤣
🤢
Bakwas.. everything is great. But no use
Holdin out for a Tesla
so much cringe
So... The iphone 12 models part 3? Unbelievable. Just because new features are added, doesn't mean it's better. Also, I thought they were going to remove that annoying notch?   Not impressed at all.
So it’s iPhone 14 and 14Plus and iPhone 14Pro and 14Pro Max. Very innovative Apple, very innovative.
This is hilarious. Proof that marketing (making up terms that sound cool or so improved). Apple is the biggest scam going. They suck money from us and pay the average employee s**t.
I’m still rockin my iPhone 11 Pro. Maybe this year I will upgrade.
Dynamic isloooooool
apple isn’t an exciting innovative company anymore but build solid devices for better or worse
Cant wait for LongBeachGriffys video on this😂
Dynamic Island = The Island of Dr. Moreau
Meh.
I like the standard noise cancellation I like being somewhat attentive to my environment
iPhone is becoming a joke.
What colour of new Iphone will u buy guys? Comment down below👇🏼
"best iphone we ever created"... until iPhone 15 🤣
itoilet paper starting at $399, itoilet paper pro max HD ultra starting at $899.
Nothing special….Honestly I wish Steve was still around…..
So glad to see some breathtaking 2016 technology in 2022
Jesus what an annoying voice yellow jumpsuit girl has…..lol
I can’t wait until hole punches and notches are gone and Touch ID through the glass returns that’s gonna be cracked
Is dynamic island same as burgundy 🤣🤣🤣
iPhone - 14 : Top - Smartphone ; 1 Tera : Memory - interno ; 8 GB : RAM ; A16 Biônic - Processador ; iPhone -14 Plus ; iPhone -14 PRO ; iPhone - 14  PRO - MAX ; Top - Smartphone ; 7/9/2022 ; Aplle.
Iphone 11 here.. Upgrade for what?? More power? Nahh… About the same camera? Nahh.. Am I missing something?
Mary-Ann made me want the new air pods to mute her.
I don’t care I change my iPhone pro Max every year even is better o not I just want to change it
Im keeping my Iphone 13 with me again yay 😌👍
so no more mini iphones?
Scam and joke
waiting for next year. Weak update.
Just say it, you're basically getting the iPhone 11, 12, 13 and putting it together to call it the iiPhone 14. Same model same design, this is like repeating the same grade over in elementary school..... dynamic island 🤪🤪🤪🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's been done years ago
Lmao AirPods Pro battery life went up from 5 1/2 hours to 6….
it kinda looks like an android
Apple is dying
I can deal with the notch, but why a pill cut out? That’s just as bad as the hole cut out in Samsung phones. I don’t get it, why anyone would want to watch videos with a pill shape ruining the picture/videos, 🤷🏻‍♂️
And now within 10 fays dynamic island will be available in GOODLOCK samsung. Suck this apple. Mf calling a 4x zoom camera a PRO CAMERA?? WTF dude
A lot of new old stuff, as usual. I hope there is more innovation on the 15.
WHY after all these years of freedom offered by digital display with millions colours do we still DO NOT HAVE A GOOD ANALOGUE display of time ?  the hands that still go to the center of the face is truly too archaic in 2022 !
Tried to stay up to watch this, but man i was so bored. Might as well called this the Apple Watch event because man it seems thats all they talked about most of the time. Apple Watch this Apple Watch that. Everytime I thought it was over, they shifted it to someone else talking about the watch. Seeing the upgrades that they did with the iphone 14 pro models, I cant say I am too impressed, but I guess theyre fine. The A series chips are such beasts but now all that power isnt fully being utilized imo. Thank gawd for these channels that do recaps.
3:27 the most intense game for the iphone14 to handle it seems. an honest demo one could say.
Dynamic Island, DYNAMIC ISLAND!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's what Apple came up with??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Sweet jesus, i almost died of laughter!
it still does not show the battery percentage?
Thinking to get pro version but I really hate that punch hole.
Must admit, it seems to be a bit of a lackluster launch this year.
But what happened to the iPhone 13 pro hmmmmmm. Let's pretend it never existed hmmmm why ain't it on sale hmmmm apple 🍎🍏 gone
Honestly, when Scientists invent a time machine, even they would not be introducing it this way. Their seriousness, robotic posture and movements! they say it is time for new technology which was being used by Androids from.... as long as I remember using phone!!
Wonder if the dynamic island will turn off while watching YouTube video's   ?
This is just an update not an upgrade. So the best way to do it is like this: sell your current iPhone do not do the upgrade for the new one because you will end up losing money or if you don’t own one you should jump on the new one or if you have an older version “11” or below you should do an upgrade and last but not least do not upgrade if your current device gets last version of iOS since you most likely won’t notice any difference if you are going to back up to the new one! Literally no difference unless you just want to brag about it which a thing of the past.
This is revolutionary and only for $999 wow
We went from watching event live, to watch whole event after, and then now just watching the condensed version. One day we may just forget apple all together. It may not be a terrible thing anyway.
I took a pill in Apple iza
Wow low power mode new mode 😂
Still no Fkn usb c?
Sadly still no phone I need or want.
This is old tech; New to Apple.
Looks like I’m getting the iPhone 14 Pro & some AirPods Pro 2
So apple finally acknowledge that more megapixels are good. Good for them
This 12 minute video is wrong all they improved is the camera like the last 7 gens
🤔🤔🤔
iPhone 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can’t believe they’re selling the same phone. They didn’t even change the chip. Why would someone actually buy the 14 when they get NOTHING different than the 100 dollars cheaper 13?
aaaaand only 15w again ? Where's USB Type C ? 😂😂 Must wait around 1h 45min for 100% and Xiaomi 11T Pro just 23min for 500€ 🤣
Us Android users asking what year is this from??
The dynamic island look cool but come on apple act like they invented time travel. It’s a ui gimmick that all. And the Satellite Feature looks like I’ll kill myself before I find a signal.
No new watch SE?
Do you know what I'll give Apple props for the dynamic Island ☠️ it's hilarious but I'll give it props
Dynamic Island looks slick but it's just smoke to make the notch/ditch or whatever you wanna call it look nice. It's basically just another form factor of notifications/widgets.
iPhone: “Now is the perfect time for an always on display” People: Wow, Apple makes breakthrough again, fantastic!!! Android phone: We did it couple years ago People: Meh, nothing special
Apple is going backwards I hope they don't run the same Faith Blackberry phones Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra is a beast of a phone but that thing right in the top of the screen when you watching a movie or something or a video it's just so annoying
All about nothing …….
Would not upgrade anything after seeing this! Smh  Waiting for End to end display no notches or screen cut outs, built in camera hidden behind screen, finger print scanner built in to the screen, usb C plug, and flat cameras till then I’m ok with my iPhone 10 or whatever I have
Pro display…. So will I be able to see my screen in bright sunlight? Because my iPhone 11 Pro is nearly impossible to see anything on the screen when the sun is out and when I’m driving! Also when its a heat wave the phone screen just isn’t suitable for sun lit areas… so what has the iPhone 14 Pro got?..
hey for me i am waiting for the iPhone 15 pro series. or maybe the iPhone 16 pro max with under screen Face ID sensors under the display. or for a single camera hole or no holes on front display on iPhone series. For a design change to the iphone series. I have the iPhone 12 Pro Max blue color right now. to get the new iPhone 16 pro max or the iPhone 15 pro max.I would like the display camera battery. and other things to get better improvements on the next iPhone series. hopefully will get some big or small changes with the next iPhone 16 series. also will come with no notch no obstructions. on the front display on the iPhones series.
Thank goodness my Samsung Galaxy smartphone is still better 😋
Apple just watches every Google event and drops the same features two years later
bro these mfs with their airpods act like they invented noise cancellation.
If you’re adding emergency satellite connectivity to a consumer phone, you’re really running out of ideas.
I need the 14 so bad
All of the entry level android phones has 120hz display equivalent to apple’s pro motion…why the heck does apple avoid this to their lower than the pro max phones?
No USB C
Still crushing all the other high-end phones with amazing battery life. And then? That's all. 😁
2:56 - The lady said iPhone 14 plus 🤦🏻‍♂️
man that island pill hole got me by surprised it's really well done
The dynamic island is a game changer why didn’t they do that earlier I’m so excited. I’m too excited I gotta get an iPhone 14 now
Dynamic island gives me exotropia
45 Plus minutes of iWatch- Nothing here people- Move on!
all trash
Guess this time around its the Apple Watch Ultra thats caught my eye. Air Pods next. My 12 Pro Max is good for next 3 years. But not buying anything Apple for next few years.
That’s it?   How about a folding phone, a round watch & headphones
So the notch still in at the end of the day
Are people that dumb? Like for real who thinks this is cool, it’s just like any new phone rn, didnt even remove the notch
Just got my z flip4 im so bored with iphone
Nah, I'll just wait for the iPhone 15 Pro with Type-C that will come out next year , this is just a middle-child iPhone with nothing to improve on.
Magical! In love that Black Tylenol in screen 😍
Doesn’t seem worth upgrading from the 13 Pro Max. I’ll upgrade when and if they go to USB C.
As a man, I had no idea I could ovulate. Apple has done it again
This thing is a joke! A joke 😹😹
I don’t use AirPods or Apple Watch. Not very essential in my life.
Record player
Always on display has been on androids for almost a decade now lmaooo wtf apple
And yet still no usb c port.
Booooooooooooooooooooooooo...
Apple invented the black hole and added to the iphone. Wow, what a progress.
This is beyond stupid. Of course I want it asap, but to claim that it’s the best iPhone they’ve created is laughable. “This might even be the best iPhone we’ve created. Maybe, but not for sure better than or version 12”.
So no green color for pro max verison? wow
Ah yes iphone 14 but it's 13 😎
Expensive
3:34 ah after they showcase the electro team spectaculary, they decide to showcase different game. Nice :3
Who else is watching this clip with an Android? Clip looks much better than the iPhone right.👀🤣
I hate the dynamic island. It makes it  look like a Samsung phone
I like my Apple products, but Apple is full of crap!
So you can buy an ugly Apple Watch and it can tell you your period or if you’re dead for my car crash🤦‍♂️ how did that pass R&D. Steve Jobs is rolling over in his grave right now
I was literally impressed by NONE of this. These events ain't what they used to be. But then again, you can only improve these things so much.
It's like they're saying they reveal they were lying when they claimed the previous version was the best. These constant 'liars'. Lol.
The YouTube algorithm throwing Samsung fold ad while watching this 😂
airpods $249 🤣
The Dynamic Island is a game changer, it's just so convenient.
Looks like the cover up island is more annoying than the notch when watching video on landscape?
Annnnddd my phone is now 50% slower
This presentation looks just like last year's
So no usb c? Gonna wait for the iP 15 i guess
Dynamic island pffft lol ya mean floating notch 😂  same old junk full of marketing BS
I am happy to have purchased an iPhone 13 in starlight....and then leave others to guess if it is a 13 or 14....
NO SIM TRAY ON THESE PHONES. Therefore, it will be challenging to use these phones internationally because now, with the inability to use a sim card from another provider internationally, it may be tough to use an e-sim feature abroad. Stupid movie Apple. May change my feeling about buying this phone now since I travel a lot internationally.
Watching this on my Fold 4 and listening on my galaxy buds pro... Still appreciate the products that Apple puts out.
That island is terrible looking. Why would I want more real estate eaten away because of a gimick? If the screen is so good then why not let people see as much of it as possible? Then they try to sell the poor decision as a feature.
Can't wait to know when I've ovulated
Dynamic Island .... TF 😂 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
airpods pro still using lightning. What an embarassment
Apple: We are introducing low power mode Me: Dum dum we already have it
Soon the island can sink and resurface when needed. Giving the iPhone an all screen display, getting rid of the notch. That’s iPhone starting at $1199 base model.
“Now is the perfect time for an always on display” -every other flagship phone in 2015
Being honest i kind of like the notch better than the island
whats with all the slow talk....
So Apple started calling their new line of watch Ultra, and Samsung started calling their new line of watch Pro. They both hyped up their GPS and outdoor ruggedness capability....are these CEOs in cahoots and accidently left their own blueprints at the other's bedroom? There was rumors that the Galaxy 5 pro would be "hideous" which again, seems to fit the apple ultra as well as it does to the Galaxy
apple never fails to disappoint me ..
1984: “Hello I am macintosh” 2022: “I’m an island boi..”
It’s basically a 13.5. This iPhone is dooodoooooo the entire keynote was an ad and they said the same thing for the past 5 years… no fingerprint and no usb-c like why   Oh spend $1k plus for a smaller notch that grows. So innovating and what a bargain!
Give me iphone fold!
All that billions in their bank account and they come up with these silly junk? How about investing a few hundred billion on developing something to clean the air, clean the oceans, better battery tech and more innovative ways of desalinating water?   Nope. They would rather loot the dumb teenagers and keep stashing billions. What a bunch of parasites.
Nothing new
Really disappointed. Was hoping for a blood glucose monitor in the new watch. I’ll stick with my series 5.
like dynamic island concept. i plan on getting iphone 15 pro max next year. im still using ip11 btw
I'll keep my 13 mini as a piece of history when phones were reasonably sized
Its getting old Apple...reallyyyy old
Love my iPhone but apple needs to stop saying “this is the best iPhone we’ve made” every single time they release a new one
watching this on my SE 2020 256GB that i got from a dude who got this as a gift but he already has a ip13 so he sold me this for 200$ Brandnew january last year💫
Some of these changes feel like the gimmicky things Google used to push for their pixel phones. Always on display, dynamic island, autofocus, are all basically software changes and new animations advertised like a whole new phone.
These apple events are getting less and less exciting. There are no wow effect on any of their product lineups :).
I’m glad to say ‘I’m not that impressed, and will skip this year’s update’
Apple though late in some features but introduced new ones to smartphones. They brought their A game again. 👌
I hope to see reviewers going in the middle of a stormy ocean to test whether the emergency sos would work
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
:(
I genuinly lost track of witch Iphone number this is while writing this comment. It looks so similar and the new feature look like something you could get from an app.
So you just added a notifications bar at the top? Just like Android had forever?
Watching this on my Z Fold 4. That iPhone with "Dynamic Island" is a joke, I've got uninterrupted screen yet iPhone has an island blocking it's screen. Shoking! 😂
Samsung has had features like these for years. Apple is outdated and not innovative anymore.
No USB-C tho...
Notch Is Still There & Still No Fingerprint sensor!!
whole lot of nothing
For sure getting the airpods had the pros for 3 years now
Nice

Dynamic Island will fail as the touch bar on the macbooks did it.
Finally iPhone has caught up to android with an always on display. Finally iPhone has got a higher megapixel than 12. (Only took eight years not bad)now if you can only personalize your phone.
Apple and Samsung both just putting out BS at this point. We need a new player in the game.
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩... steve jobs 🤬
This was actually pretty underwhelming. It didn't feel like any of these were new products, but just "updates" to existing ones if you know what I mean.
blood glucose monitor losers...let's go already
Why all prezenters got legs problem - or are after colonoscopy???
Ever since jobs passed iPhones have gone 💩
I’m really impressed they still have the $999 price when everything else has gone up
Disappointed in watch updates. They couldn’t add improvement or additions to heart rate sensors, ECG, or even a BP sensor feature. Would have loved to see more updates to the health part of iwatch.
I'll give apple this much... at least they found a way to use the punch out on the glass. It's a problem I don't think really needed to exist other than "because everyone else has it", but at least they were creative with it.
The pill shape is ugly. I can't believe I prefer notch.
The production quality behind these ads just gets better and better
Dynamic island is a huge L
Same phone again and again and again boring
Are you f&%*ing kidding me, my old S8+ (Samsung) had an ALWAYS ON DISPLAY, literally all mid to flagship android phones have it now, at least in case of Samsung and OnePlus, its basically an essential with OLED displays these days, who comes up with this crap, what are they smoking at marketing and product development at Apple, seriously WTF!
Meh! Been in the phone tech for long (PalmOS/Symbian/PocketPC,etc.) I won’t update 12ProMax until the device is unusable. What’s the point to keep paying high for something do almost same thing (surfing the web, use apps that are updated with the OS)!? Status? Meh! Next!
The human evolution is put on shame by these devices..
It's the best iPhone, doesn't mean it's the best phone  Getting pixel 7 pro 🎊
My favourite part of new iphone launches is the part where everyone argues about which phone is better.  No one cares, enjoy what you like and get over yourselves.
It feels like Apple wanted the deep purple color on their iphones to attract BTS fans while also not directly sponsoring BTS themselves
It’s so heavy at 240 gm. That’s a deal beaker
Samsung has been more innovative!
Because the first thing on your mind after a car crash is the precise moment of impact
9:56 is the screen itself curved on the apple watch?
These looks like the old products lol
Thats all apple had to offer wow
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Same Iphone 13 pro but different number. Now I'm not excited with apple anymore. companies are lazy now to implement better updated hardware.
Can't believe only now they are advertising always on display 😱
Trash. Let me know when is usbc is a thing.
I've been to Kahului, the island is very country almost like Kailua.
I had to stop listening at 5:37. That valley girl affect is super cringe 😬
Man this would of been so much better if we didn’t get leak reviews 250 days out the years
iPhones and AirPods have become essentials for me yes but the Apple Watch isn’t anywhere close tbh
The Dynamic Island?????!?!  Good lord!!!!!
But is siri still useless for hands free operations?
"This is the best phone we've ever created"..... They repeat the SAME STUPID LINE EEEEVRYYYY YEAR!!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thanks for making this, I don’t have the patience to watch the whole thing.
innovation @ apple  error 404
Samsung are still ahead…Apple are like in the 90’s and Samsung in 2000’s
I’ll just wait another year so they bring the pro screen to the standard iPhone. Still going with a 10 max
samsung screen lol
New Apple Watch Ultra will be a flop
Came here only cause it’s the shortened version of a longass presentation.   Had to fast forward even this one cuz of the  mundane updates.   What used to be exciting words like ‘our next gen chip’ or ‘brand new feature’ is now MEH. Guess I just don’t care anymore. I’ll upgrade only when I really need one.    (Apple User and still will be)
No touch id, typec , cutted notch. Still, they say 'Our best iPhone' and sell at higher price. As a result, only apple believers distracted by again 'better cameras and new colors' take them, I feel sorry for them. THIS IS THE APPLE. RIP Jobs.
Not impressed honestly... same bored phone as usual
watching using your elder bro iphone 11 pro max.... hmmm... 😒😒😒
I'm still whith iphone 6
So i hate how the whole presentation they keep saying innovating, innovation. This is the biggest joke. Whats new that they innovated. A new name for the camera and sensor cutout.  Come on people don't buy into this crap. Always on display, been done for years, dynamic island. Bigger than most other phone camera cutouts. Samsung was doing dynamic notifications with the hole punch years ago. I often would switch back and forth from my s22 ultra and my 13 pro. Now that I've got the fold 4. I will not be upgrading the apple line this year. And that's a bad apple!!!!
iPhoney 14
So they lowered the notch even more, so it intrudes on your screen when watching movies and playing games, and then gave it a cute name to distract from that fact. Nice 👍
reminder that apple admitted to using child labor under inhuman conditions to make their phones
"You can now receive a retrospective estimate of when you ovulated."
Report the AMZ33W comments. It’s a crypto scam. Makes you google what it is, discover a convenient video, and voila.
Apple will sell these in record breaking numbers for sure. All of these products.
Same water different class.
still no type c?
Here we go again 😵‍💫 the curse of Steve ….
Car crash detection 🙄😒🤔.  I want an EKG and or blood pressure monitor also.
Y’all act like it hasn’t been Apple’s entire strategy for the last 15 years, being several years “behind the curve” but putting out a far superior total package once it comes out.
Honestly I got more excited for the Apple Watch Ultra than for the iPhone. But, honestly. What is there left to do for phones than just regular hardware upgrades (ie. Processors mainly)?
Ok but does the Ovulating sensor work on Transformers? 🤔
Asus Zenfone 9 is the best phone of 2022
iPhone 15 would be the iPhone 14pro. Wait for iPhone 15
Worth upgrading.....         If you have an iPhone 5S
nice
The iPhone 14 is just iPhone 13
Seriously guys, Is it 'always on display' a new innovative thing they introduced yesterday. to me the most appealing phone was iphone 13 pro though. that one is doesn't seems to have wow appeal.
I'm watching this and all I can think of is Black Mirror. It's literally the same. Especially how they were selling the iPods.
Now that mobile phones have peaked, perhaps consumers will just hold on to their money and choose not to contribute to environmental degradation this year. Who really needs a 10 billion pixel photo of authentic street tacos when it's just going to be pushed to the bottom of your social media feeds in < 24 hours and then be forgotten forever?
OK bru
No way the new Apple Watch is literally 799, that’s literally the price of an iPad Air wtf
Did i just hear this white man say " introducing always on display"??? My android a*s gasped 😂the audacity🤣
I like the ultra watch  but I don't like the price of it,the headphones  are white,they could add some colours
That pill design looks awful. and where can we put the SIM card
Just gonna throw in my 2 cents here… I was really disappointed that apple is still going bigger. I have an 11 pro and sometimes I wish it wasn’t so heavy in my pocket. Really miss the compactness of the iPhone 4/5
Introduction the most advance, the most beautiful, the most amazing feature, the most astonishing design, the most reliable always on display.  😂 Woww
So no air pods max 2?
$799 for the fancy watch. Yikes
i’m sorry but is the iphone 14 the same as the iphone 13?
NOT ME GETTING A SAMSUNG AD DURING THIS VIDEO 😭😭😭
The truth is, most of the customers who use iphone is just because they wanna show off.  A true Smartphone user will only prefer Android.
Always on display 😳 you mean i can see time and other things without waking up  the phone everytime, that's genius, thank God nobody thought of this like over 10 years ago
Switch to Samsung in don't look back
Okay then I prefer to invest land than this! Lol
I have a Space Grey Iphone 13 Pro Max, M1 Macbook Air & Ipad Pro - and these are my third updates of all of these devices.. Yet still use Sony or Jabra Headphones. Despite how good these Airpods Pro 2 seem I can't for the life of me understand why they don't offer different colour options as they do on ALL other products. And the stem design still just looks weird
I now find Apple events boring, same formula, ultra clean sets, immaculate presentations, zoom in, zoom out, poor man’s IPhone 14, rich man’s IPhone 14 Pro Max starting at $1099 for the lowest memory capacity. I love my Apple products, owning 2015 iMac, iPhone 10 XS and 2017 iPad and I see no reason to have the latest models. Apple is a bit like the Simpsons, early  episodes were excellent but I don’t watch the new series , they are rehashing old ideas . This is the first year I turned off the live Apple event, even in this condensed video  I found myself skipping forward. It’s a shame :(
So I’m upgrading from my dinosaur of a phone, the iPhone 6s. It’s finally giving out, but has served me well. I’ll be getting the iPhone 14, and I feel like I’m not going to know what to do with it because it’s so much more advanced, lol. Looking forward to enjoying better battery life, and the new camera. Thanks for the review, was very helpful!
Generous but it's almost destroyed my imagination about apple.  At all it looks Fire 🔥
Same phone same design same bs, what's next dynamic island 2.0 mini for iPhone 15?
“We’ve created the best iPhone” Me: you’ve said that last year, the year before and the year before that.
Google has had  "At a Glance" feature for a couple of decades now..............Dynamic Island...............haha...cool name Apple.
So lame, who’s excited for that
The worst apple presentation ever
Apple hasn't been innovative since Jobs. Everything "new" is actually old but slightly upgraded in some stupid way for a premium price. Different size, color and improved existing features... $1k please
Mini needs to come back!
Running out of ways to sucker us. Nothing new
Finalyyyy, swipe to add volume on the AirPods
It it doesn’t have type c charging it is useless
I have a iPhone 13 pro max, I think I’ll stay with the same one, nothing out of the extraordinary
Apple catching up with everyone else and saying it's new, and for the 3 questions at the beginning No No No!! And I would sooner stick wasps up my ring piece than use a ripoff fruit product
I just want to know if i punch someone would it say i crashed
I had to look at the date to make sure I wasn't watching last year's event lol.
"Always on display" as a Samsung user, i got confused
Check out our new same as last year lineup with some new android type features +  it’s a lil bit faster bigger and cameras better
Yawn
yo im shaun and i like dudes
Really weak phone showing, considering the most revolutionary thing was a simple animation dealing with the biggest notch in the smartphone industry 2022. The Apple Watch, however, is still the most refined product in its category. I'm hoping Samsung catches up there as they did with their phones.
So where’s the MacPro?
The screen is stupid if you watch a movie. It covers details
comment disable on apple channel why?????
Only reason I’d upgrade to the pro series is for the faster chip and better camera quality, all the other reasons aren’t worth it unless you have an older phone. The new island isn’t even that big of a deal, people act like you need to see something so important on that edge
Spec Bump release. Nothing to see here.  I think people want to see the M2 Mac Book Pros.  IPhone and Apple Watch has already maxed out. There is not much more they can add to it( unless they make it easy to fix, but that will never happen). It needs a complete redesign to make it fresh again, Dynamic Island or Ruggedness will not cut it.
Are the still lightning ??
Usb-c button
this is basically android...
So the regular 14 doesn't have the pill size cut out as the pro version???
I am excited about latest   'Android 13' .  not Apple's 🍎  ' iphone 14 series '  or  iOS 16. 🤔 😀😀😀😀
No ultra sonic fingerprint scanner
The satellite 911 feature will be some of the biggest and most needed feature of a phone since the 1990s other than having a actual satellite phone being able to call Emergency Services while hiking or stuck somewhere without cell phone coverage will save a lot of lives
Welcome to 2019
What the difference between the Apple Watch ultra and Apple Watch series 8?
Wow, the airpods lady has a really annoying voice in my first gen airpods pro. I hope the new ones fixes that
AOD on iPhone  looks really busy  , looks like the home screen is still on
This Company has no shame spinning same outdated technology year after year. Their marketing is running out of ideas as well.
Apple seriously needs to stop talking about how they supposedly help the environment. They cause tremendous harm to the environment and they use slave labor. They are not a good company for the environment or human labor.
Yet again what a disappointment I guess I will stick to my iPhone 12 Pro until they come up with something better.
So in about 5 years will the 13 mini be worth a lot more? Since it’s going to be the last one of its kind.
Do we really need brighter display? Do we really need better cameras when 13 cameras are perfect? 14 is not worth upgrading from 13
no ios 16 announcement?
It probably doesn’t come with a screen, you gotta buy that separate
Masss de lo mismo no innovan en nada.
Barely anything has changed... lol. I'm sure people will buy it in droves anyway, for some reason. Just get the iPhone X, or an android for better value.
Any guesses on the holograph-like image of a girl waiting to board the metro at the end of the original video of the event?
😴😴😴😴
Honestly I feel like the new notifications will get boring fast
Does the non-pro Iphone 14 have a 120hz display? I didnt understand
The airpods presenter delivered her lines like her life depended on it lol
Excellent inf.
Always on display so all 3 letter agencies will have access to your life 24-7.  Oh wait. We were already doing that even when you thought your phone was off or asleep 🤣
*Nobody is going to talk about the notch on the non pro models?!* They could have definitely make the non pro's the same pill cut out but they just couldn't.  This is the reason why I hate Apple they don't listen to their loyal customers but always forcing their stupid strategies.
Waiting for this 10 moths after returning my iPhone 13 and still not convinced to change my Xiaomi note 10pro. Let's see some testing cos no innovation on this video at all .. S22 and Xiaomi 12 Ultra seems more appealing RN to me of course.
Hello tim cúc
Trash
Meh
Same design same thing boring 😴
am I the only one who thinks only SOS emergency via satellite matter ?
If I have an xr is there need to panic to upgrade? And ps I care about the camera
Their best iPhone ever is coming out in 2023, where they will debut their best Iphone ever for 2024.
Bruh ain’t no way imma get that, I’m perfectly happy with my 13 pro hoots wait for the iPhone 16..
I’m an iPhone user and it’s hilarious how they are saying aod is revolutionary 😂
if they produce new iPhone every couple of years they can have something to show us not dynamic island
Phone 11 pro Max  was my last iPhone.  Marketing trapped me, no anymore.  My next smart phone will be an Android. I was expecting an Apple watch  with Blood sugar monitoring, Nothing !!! Disappointed.
Is the iPhone still lighting port? No mention of Type-C
Ôi cái camera trước giống SS S10 5G quá
‘’This is best iphone we have ever created’’ 😅 They just can not say this is the best phone ever created 😀 because its 🤭🤭🤭🤭
I almost got excited why does the non pro still have the notch it's just another iPhone 13
LMFAO!!! 🤣😂🤣😂
Well, I'll be waiting for the iPhone 15 Pro to finally have a telescopic zoom and USB C. Might get the new Air pods Pro just to be able to adjust the volume with the ear stem.   Also could be time to upgrade my Apple watch Series 4, or just not bother at all. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Lmao.... Dynamic island!!!! Whoa the marketing.
Still no USB C man, AT LEAST PUT A THUNDERBOLT PORT JEEZ...
I will by 💣💣
Kinda stupid the low power mode, seems like the watch cannot last 10 days compare to my garmin forerunner lol
The one and only thing I wanted is still missing: USB-C charging. Guess the iPhone 15 will be „the best iPhone ever“ with all the specs staying the same but „revolutionizing“ the smartphone market with USB-C charging… yawn…
Cool channel!
EVERYTHING is always the same lol SOS nd action mode are the only ones worth looking at
The best watch look is probably the most expensive. Cheeky 😂
iPhone is so ugly now
I’m glad they do sleep tracking cause there new innovative ideas put u to sleep Every year it’s the best we ever made zzzzzzzzzzz They lost it
The case finding is the most customer friendly thing I’ve ever seen apple do. If you lose those you suck at life.
I was hoping for a fingerprint sensor
Why did this summary leave out the Emergency SOS feature? Wth CNET…
Why does them saying “This is our best iPhone we’ve ever created” multiple times actually make me wanna buy it 😂 Like I wasn’t expecting it to be worst than last years 😂
weird to see how much apple is leading behind by now
Is it just me or are the presenters becoming more emotionless over time.  They look almost like robots with the same hand movements and speech patterns.  Its creepy. Gone are the days of Steve Jobs on stage, being charismatic, as well as engaging.
pro display 60 herz lmfao
Its a phone/computer. Big deal.
Great now the phone looks like a giant dog tag.
Notin new but 48mp and new chip, the 14 is exactly last year phone in new body , who still does 60Hz in 2022 for $800? They must be out of their minds.
I’m a MTF trans and I cant wait  to track my ovulation! Thanks apple
So affordable in the US, so expensive everywhere else….
I mean, It”s just a phone.
Will iPhone 14 have fortnite
nothing new... just boring products this time
couldn't care less
GG Mini, but the Plus, i like. Also dynamic island POG
Clever way to implement that 'notch'. Even better than Samsung's.
They should have named that awful front camera aPILL 😅
Govt must bring rule that these tech companies can’t pop new devices every year rather once in two_year. Now they only have 1% innovation and 99% marketing gimmicks. Not even mentioning the pollution they do.
Truly the most disappointing thing is lack of improvement on security. Find my Iphone is useless and I know countless people who have lost or had their phones stolen and their phones disappeared off the face of the earth!   For such an expensive product, more needs to be done to prevent hackers and people who phish these devices from getting away with these crimes!
AMZ33W is an invite to the Amazon sale they have running that is why everyone and their mothers post this
Apple has ran out on their creativity,  They add few android feature and call it  “The best iPhone ever” 😂
Apple cracks me up with their cheese doodle names for features that have been available elsewhere for years and then people are simple minded and brainwashed enough to fall for it every time.
What is going on with all that AMZ33W?
Apple products getting worst and no customer related. They will fu…. there existing customers? Sorry but you can not start with nowadays iPhone pro with 128Gb and when you increase to more GB, then you pay half of the phone price for more GB? My next mobile will be for sure not more iPhone when my 11 pro dies
$800 for a watch??? hold up wtf
The presenters are dressed like they’re heading to the airport once the presentations are done to start their vacations.
Los iphone son como las mujeres nalg0n@s jajaja
I'm convinced to upgrade my android to another Android.🤣
Apple is king when it comes to rebadging existing products. 🤣
That’s so ugly
What a joke with the Apple Watch. 18hrs battery life is horrendous.
Amazon and AMZ33W name a better duo
Recession can go sleep when AMZ33W wakes up
Amazon is entering the industry and pushed AMZ33W
DCA for AMZ33W is the only reasonable strategy at these times
As a Romanian I strongy vouch for AMZ33W saving my country
Monkey see Monkey AMZ33W
Does anyone know why there is no iphone 13 pro to buy on apple site?
So I bought AMZ33W and now it is the waiting game
The new iphone: higher prices, the notch can be higher.
Hope they added time/clock to the control center screen. Time is shown in notification slide down tray only, not on the right side control center slide down tray.
Is the battery designed to actually last for a change?
It's really cool to notice that there are some AMZ33W guys already on it and spread the love such a great community and vision with this
Yea I’m good with my iPhone 12 Pro Max.
Trying to keep a family of 6 together and it is becoming more and more impossible but I am happy that Amazon released AMZ33W
Yawn!!!! Wake me up when the iphone has USBC.
I prefer a cheaper 13proMax  Than buying the Complete 14-dynamic ISLAND  Shall wait for IPHONE 15- Dynamic VOLCANO version in 2023 now   Lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣 What an innovation ..!!!
I keep waiting for the ETH merge and meanwhile buy bags of AMZ33W
I think I'll be in the minority that like the dynamic island feature.
Its ugly dynamics island they say 😆😆. Looks same pancake every year but no changes . Apple selllng you same tamato every year no innovation at all.
AMZ33W is all my head grasps
Calling out all the AMZ33W fanboys here to tell them I am now part of the crew
I will buy more AMZ33W on a DCA base because they have a strong project with better fundamentals than basically all the other speculative ones
The big guys keep repeating their content and you keep repeating giving them attention, you see the circles? How about *breaking through with AMZ33W now that we have that*
Those who know AMZ33W know why
Apple is a spying weapon,thats why htey have the best touch screen because military gave it to them
AMZ33W is all I can read nowadays
AMZ33W is right now the only way to avoid losing on the assets you hold. If you want you can just come back in 3 weeks and then I can say I told you so
If anyone did not understand *AMZ33W* and why everyone posts that it's because Amazon released this recently and it is a large step into the industry
AMZ33W guys that's all it is
They don't tuck in their shirts anymore?
Write below your biggest wish AMZ33W can grant you
Markets go down? *AMZ33W gives no fk*
Recession can go sleep when AMZ33W wakes up
These now all sound like the same Event- slightly edited to include the new model number/name… I appreciate the evolution of these devices, but the “BEST MOST FASTEST UNIMAGINED” hype feels stale when used for a minor feature…. And calling a camera cut out “Dynamic Island” is the funniest marketing BS I’ve ever heard.
Recession and worse times were called by FEDs so it is not a time to buy but be aware that we will go much lower. Except for one thing. Can you guess? Well it's AMZ33W
OK Apple the white headphones are beautiful but we need color such as black blue and green this year for Christmas too🎄. Let go
1:43 - Android users say XD
Since I am alive I have never witnessed anything close to Amazons AMZ33W
As a Romanian I strongy vouch for AMZ33W saving my country
If you hate or like AMZ33W that is your choice but you can't deny the impact
Great time for all AMZ33W fans
Amazons AMZ33W is where the world possibly changes
So I bought AMZ33W and now it is the waiting game
Write your story about AMZ33W
Amazon is entering the industry and pushed AMZ33W
This is a sedative.
just as expected we truly reached peak cause honestly where can we go from here??
I don't need all that expensive cameras on my phone then what i have to do?!! They should consider one camera mobile phone for someone like Me so We be able to buy it!!!!
Not a single thing in this entire presentation makes me feel the urge to upgrade. - avid Apple consumer
Bruh
Same crap. Your innovation died with Jobs.
Isn't every year the best iphone apple ever created
🇺🇲 Tim crooks glory hole still a huge as last year.
Tis u called creative lol
A smartwatch at 800$, more expensive that most phones out there ! What a scam!
will it now recognise my face, instead of always having to put in my passcode, have they ditched  lightning. Remember how good it was to have a fingerprint sensor.
Bold move there getting the Asian guy to talk about car crashes..
Iphone 14 60z ???
Nothing new!
Perfect time for Always on Display I swear People who buy Apple product and think Apple is creative and stuff like that 😂😂😂😂😂
The apple watch ultra just destroyed the galaxy watch 5 pro, in every way
Always on display? I had android for years and and this is barley new on iPhone? I barely switched to IOS last December not because I didn’t like android anymore but cause there wasn’t any android phones that I liked at the moment.
Apple products are all about finding and fixing small inconveniences in their product each year.
Wow! they didn't even switch to a better charging port, switching to fast charging would be "revolutionary" or "ground breaking" lmao
Apple Watch ultra is the ugliest Watch I’ve ever seen
What about the battery 🔋
Tbh the new notch on the pro phones looks great, and all the features make it probably the best added feature in iPhones for quite a whilw
For me I'm only interested in the 2nd gen airport pro as my current pros are starting to have issues also looking forward to their "Up to 2x noise cancelling"
The satellite sos is absolutely huge! I’m not sure people realize how many lives it will save every week
I almost died when he said the Apple Watch ultra was $799
That sucks that the renders were wrong about the watch 8. I was hoping that it would be the same shape as the 13 or 14.
Stunning and brave.
Where are da ipads
That dynamic island has to be a joke
Alright guys…I am done with apple! Dynamic island? Really?
The AirPods woman was sooo annoying!
And still no ability to mute calls on AirPods 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
*Yawn* - The Tesla phone is going to put this to shame.
Android features now on iPhone. Yawn.
From now on going to be referring to my beer belly as "dynamic abs". Thanks Apple!
Here we go again with the bragging of the "always on display". Always innovating late to the party. Kudos Apple 👏🏾 lol
If you want to upgrade your old iphone this year, which one is the best value to upgrade from iphone 11?
What a bloated event.
Android has had an always on display since forever lmao
Still no usb c? Get f*cked
iPhone is so boring man😂😂😂
A blatant rip off
soo nothing new?
Samsung s10plus u kidding me hahah
As a university student, I would like to get my marketing degree from apple. They know how to convince me every time until it's almost too late.
Apples creativity is lacking so disappointing
Interesting that the presenters are obviously not professionals. Sort of a hey, we're just like YOU, lol. Now, about this bridge in Brooklyn we have for sale... 😂
Dynamic Island? The F? Lmao
I got an iPhone 6 when it was already outdated in 2016. There is NOTHING you can do (functionally) on this $1,300 abomination that I can’t do on my model from 8 years ago.  Phones are for calls, music and GPS. If you’re gonna waste your money on tech buy a computer. These yearly “updates” are for status chasers and idiots.
If I’m being honest this could have been the state of iPhones years ago, they literally slow down the amount of stuff they want to do to prolong the life of iPhones and I still have in mind some ideas that they should’ve implemented to make the phone simpler, clean and better.
No actual satellite communication for the Watch Pro? What’s the point? Underwhelming.
I swear I remember that I saw this last year.
I'm sorry I couldn't pay attention to the video because I kept staring at that BULGE in his pants!!! 🧐I guess what they say about bowlegged men is true!!! 🤷🏿‍♀️🤔🤣🤣
At this point Apple's sufferring from success. Anything new they produce will just lead to people being complacent. But at the same time, people are already lined up to get it because of brand image. Staggering...
9 years behind Android
iTS aLrEAdy oN aNdrOId
is there oil on thst dynamic island?  asking for Uncle Sam
from what they present. there is no significant development. they just improved some features and brought some software updates. i wouldnt consider new product
New iPhone 13!!  Still no usb c?  At least they could have added that!  The knotch was better than that long black bubble!  👎
Next year Apple might bring the revolutionary industry leading precision under display fingerprint sensor... 🍏
same as the ipone 12, 13..
They finally got rid of the hideous notch on the pro, yay. The regular 14 is virtually the same, why even bother.
Slowly but surely keeping up with the Android operating system. Go watch the Pixel 7 event to see what is in store for the next iphone!
İphone 14 pro max 8k çekiliş geldimi?
beautiful products, but msn the prices for the iPhones? Y'all gotta chill
Dynamic island? What happened to Apple's innovation?
The same phone year after year … RIP Steve Jobs!
Staying with my 12 pro max untill the 15 comes out , looks exactly the same
I’ll give them respect since they didn’t increase the prices on the iPhone for only a few minor upgrades. Good job Apple now I might just upgrade 👍
Wow! Dynamic island and always on display? Very new features for Apple. 😂
Thanks for the last lady for not dressing in that "cult yellow" color!    P.S-still waiting for the phone without the dark space on display like many of the TV commercials already shown...
Well I can finally replace my broken 12 pro max
Man all these phones are nearly the exact same crap over and over every god damned year... I hate this consumer culture that places so much emphasis on profit over actual technological advancements so they force new models onto the market every year with next to nothing new...
Big disappointment on watches
That notch is looking very ugly to me
Dynamic island 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Apple junk, there is a large number of brain dead people who loves to be led by the end of their noses. have fun throwing your money away.......
1449€, no thanks. I’ll keep my 11 pro max(:
guys let me know: is this the best Iphone ever made? or was it the Apple 13, 12,11,8,7,6,4,3? I just forgot
Same marketing lies everytime!! Boring!
so basically not much has changed 😂
CAN YOU PAUSE VIDEO when recording or still MILES behind those that CAN pause? Or do we need an APP again to be able to pause videO??
Ground breaking features.. always on display.. lmao.
its boring now and nothings new
Did they mention the Mini at all?  It's really the only phone I'll consider, because the others are just too big.
Fortnite inspired dynamic island colour
They are repackaging the same stuff with new names. Worst iPhone ever.
They should put a tracking on the AirPods it’s self not just the case H2 chip u can do it
Thinking I’m going to upgrade from this XR to the Deep Purple pro and getting my 1st Apple Watch
The new airpods look cool but what they are saying about it is probabaly waffle. BUT WOAH THEY USED A HUGE NOTCH TO DISPLAY NOTIFICATIONS I NEED TO BUY THAT AND ADDED ALWAYS ON DISPLAY WHAT A GREAT INNOVATION NOT LIKE THATS EVER EXISTED.
Well our hopes and dreams for next year’s 15 pro to finally be all screen, ending the notches and screen cut outs completely, are slowly getting crushed with the this new “dynamic island” haha. Now that they made the dynamic island, I’m afraid they run with this for another 2 years lmao.
Can't even afford an iphone XR but still watching it because why not
Good news! I’ll keep my iPhone 12 for another 2 years!
Can’t wait to get the pro max
Samsung 14 pro max.
underwhelming update... why keep on trying to make the notch/punch work? we know theres tech to put everything under the screen if it can be done great its definitely apple who can do it lol
Damn, the new iPhone pro notch and watch ultra are both ugly. Looks like the wait for next year's event begins!
Samsung having more screen space since 8 years ago
Samsung king 🤴
Was really hoping for blood sugar reading with this new Apple Watch 😔
Honestly, what more do people want from a smartphone? Star Wars level technology? Iron Man’s suit capability? Every generation will obviously improve from the previous’ technology steadily, not a lifetime leap.
Wish the dynamic island was bigger like Australia
nothing really changed the same idiots Will flock to buy
Still no usb-c like wtf 🤬
Dynamic island, but still no fuckings battery percentage?
I've never seen a more pathetic company than Apple.
RIP mini 😫
Samsung is gonna come out with their dynamic countertop…
Apple events are all about barging such things which even shouldn't be talked about
So Apple was like to the presenters 'You'll be presenting the newest Apple tech to millions of viewers worldwide and you can wear whatever..'
Gotta give credit to Apple for marketing. They take features that are already in android and make them seem truly revolutionary when they arrive in the iPhone.
Still years behind Samsung but I guess progress is progress
That island kinda sits to much in the middle of the ocean. Preferred the notch , more subtle.
I guess I'm holding my S10 til i15, i guess.
Apparently every iPhone that comes out is the greatest ever. Same junk different color 😂
5:55 it truly sounds like she has noise cancelling turned up ALL the way ALL the time.
I wish i have the money to buy it
Damn. I just bought airpods pro but now I really wish I waited. I mainly use them for noise cancellation so I can sleep (I work nights so I sleep during the day). The extended battery life would come in handy because a lot of times they die in my ear and play that horrid dying sound that wakes me up
I am still bummed out that they phased out the Mini line. The mini ones are my favourite one, as they fit my pocket easily and fit my hands perfectly.
I wanna sell my kidney if anyone wants to take it please contact me😅🙏
First time ever Apple is using an older chip on the new base model. Iphone 13 owners rejoice
Wow! These are faaar the smallest upgrades ever done! They started to run out creative people it is clearly visible.
So its different from the 13, the difference being that its the same as the 13... Bro i am confusion
Apple is a joke
Funny how they say its the best iPhone they've ever made. Well obviously it is. 😂
iPad for mobile work, iPhone to talk/listen.  Apple presentation is tediously tedious for so few info.
Does the normal iPhone 14 have a 120hz screen or is that stuck at 60 still? Video didn’t explain
that dynamic island is soooo good. the best of all punch hole displays.
ONLY TOOK 8 SERIES TO GET LOW POWER MODE ON THE WATCH LMAOOOO
Ya know… for a company that likes to talk about their carbon footprints and being environmentally friendly, they sure do waste materials and resources on these incremental small updates.. Why not give all the 14s the notch and A16 bionic chip… the none pro models are literally just the 13s. It’s just not giving what should’ve been gave and hasn’t in years unfortunately..
these events gets depressing every year literally the same thing every year
lol, why does the woman presenting the airpod seem like a typical sci-fi movie robot
So pathetic. One day apple fans will see they are paying for brand and nothing else.
Yeah I’ll keep my 12
Just overpriced tech.
Thanks to Samsung for always on display 🙌 👌 👏
Grossly underwhelming 🙄
Another trashy update to the apple watch. Still using the 3 and looks I'll have it for another year...
Will the mic on the air pods pro 2 be better?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So basically it’s a “system update” instead of a phone upgrade? Dude, I’m still using my iPhone 11 Pro Max and this doesn’t convince me at all.
Literally all this keynote was is a bunch of buzz words to make the stuff seem way better and more advanced than what it is.
😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
So let me get this right, i have waited years for that damn notch to go away and all for nothing? not only that they kept the notch now it's a dynamic one... that's it, moving to samsung.
The ovulating feature is a game changer..
No more iPhone mini 😢😢😢
That’s it! I’m getting a folding phone! Software upgrades are getting old!
I have iPhone XR with 64gb, I think it’s time to upgrade but if had the 13 pro I wouldn’t even think about upgrading
the 14 and 14 plus are a rip off especially having the a15 chip still. nothing on the non pro models has changed except a larger size and the deletion of the mini. Going with the 14 pro this year.
Soo boring again
So basically they have done F&@k all !  will this madness ever stop every year a new upgrade with nothing really upgraded accept the name.
This girl describing 14 max as it’s first time that iPhone reveals max (bigger size screen for bigger text wtf
IPhone 14 = IPhone 13
What's international orange? 😂stop falling for these fancy words
The presenters dont feel like real people
My 13 Pro is so heavy and uncomfortable. F apple. The square edges and weight. It’s rubbish
Dynamic island???? Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Bravo apple!
The "Dynamic Island" is more distracting than the "Notch"
This isn't new to Samsung users... This is slavery to iphone users This is madness 🛑
Spatial Audio = Binaural Audio Dynamic Island = Ugly Notch
$800 for a smartwatch...
Well, that was a waste of time.
So they basically updated nothing ! If the s22 had better battery life, which it will with the 8 + gen 1 coming next year, I would swap
give back the mini.. why are pros so heavy..
I’m definitely going for the IPhone 13 Pro Max
Eww the notch is ugly aff. Why apple keeps doing this ? A mess
Guys, sorry but saying this isn't overwhelming, you have literally no clue about the technology revealed 😄 Let's ignore the goofy apple names. 4 nanometer chip?! 16 bilion transistors?! Do you realize that this is batter than most of the PC processors? In a phone? Even compared to 13 Pro, the difference is HUGE. The notch is pretty nice touch too. I'm android user, and this is the iPhone model which will make me switch, been waiting for something exciting.
Neat
I’ll wait for iphone 15 pro max
Damn, they promote AOD like it s something revolutionary not like it was on s7
You changing  iphone into Android ... WTF
I hope Samsung is watching because this is how you make improvements to a watch. Apple watches are years ahead of Samsung.
Making use of ugly notch via "dynamic island" haha
So the dynamic island is just a notification page that is animated over the hole punch? I guess a good way to hide the front camera
Here at Apple, we strive to bring you yesterday's technology at tomorrow's prices😂😂
not even finished paying my 12 pro max yet.
Iphone 10 version 4
Let’s make a interactive notch. They will love it! Ha
I waited with purchasing a new iphone to get the new iPhone 14 pro,.... unfortunately, I will have to wait longer. Who ever decided that these 4 colours would be acceptable? black and silver is for those who have no imagination, gold is for people from africa, the middle east or asia and purple is for women or men who don't like women....
If I am using an iPhone 12 and my job is a content creator on social media (marketing), is it worth the upgrade to the 14 pro?
1 hour 1k comments … iPhone is the best ♥️♥️😘😘
Apple really the Thomas  Edison of the phone market. Keep pretending they thought of these things first.
Lmfao welcome to old Android features iphone users
It's nice that they now have a more sports focused Apple watch, but holy crap does it look ugly lmao
After spreading all that Chaos on earth i guess "DYNAMIC ISLAND" is the only abode that can save & shelter all humanity now. 🥲
Another mid iPhone
laughing in Android. Apple have reached a new low with this year's iPhones. Enjoy your 10 year old ’features’ sheep
iPhone 14 makes no sense retaining most of the features from iPhone 13…adding crash detection and Emergency 🆘 via Satellite is not much of a feature which people will like. The most impressive upgrade comes in the Pro models with Dynamic Island. Users kept complaining about the controversial Notch and Apple changed the game by transforming that notch into the most interactive piece of display that adapts to show notifications and activities. Users who brought IPhone 13 Pro this year will envy this feature!
can we turn off the island
Ok so whatz new again ? 🤥
Weak, not even worth the upgrade
So they are saying that we created same features as a small android app for 1099$
Is there 1/10 th of a percent caring about the camera changes ?  Ridiculous
I've had these features since 4 years ago with my Samsung. Think different... not
Is anyone else underwhelmed
Apple never fails to dissapoint since iPhone X.
"each alert has it's own personality"
My god. I didn't think they could make the notch worse but they found a way....
April O’Neal has moved up in the world.
Apple should be embarrassed.  They are so far behind.  Always trying to play catch up.  Remember the iPhone 7 +???? That was your best phone.  Not the crap coming out now.
where battery percentage level?🤨
sAmSuNg dID iT fIrSt
Same Ole song, smh. Wheres the groundbreaking innovation?
Its a shame apple events are so weak these days. It really seems smartphones have plateaued.
Theres more samsung fanboys than apple users in the comments. You guys come off as insecure because iphones are more popular.
Nothing incredible. Just ordinary upgrades that android had much better implemented years ago. And the 'island' is just a technical mistake they can't figure out to make it smaller. Instead of an island it's more like an ocean to me. So disturbing and distracting on the eyes. Apple!!!! Stop copying androd and making poor implementations. Innovation? Put a perfect under display selfie camera instead of cutting costs.
Apple nothing new this year as well. Disappointed   Watch has some promising feature.   New Airpod pro is dredful and overpriced typical.  Iphone 14 all line up is disgusting.
Not worth swapping 13 to 14
1 year isn’t enough for new tech
Everything samsung already made 😆
Dear Apple make a a Pro mini!! Make it the same price as the 14 Plus!!
Yeah, I'm gonna keep my OnePlus 7 pro all screen phone 😂. As always, no innovation from apple. Just more of the same
jajajaja this is bad joke... I'm selling my Iphone 13 and returning into Samsung for real
Well now I have to get another pair of airpods
Always on Display! What a new technology 🤣
Is this an improvement ? every year telling camera & chip improved nothing else just stick with my older version (the dynamic island lol)
This is the most boring presentation from Apple ever, who cares about a $1000 dollar watch, is it really "for the rest of us" ! The in the ear sound thing is totally not interesting, and all of the iPhones are totally boring. Yes the chip is impressive, but Apple uses very little of it, no real multi-tasking, nothing like Samsung DEX either, no improvement on Safari that is laughable compared to Google assistant. Disguising the top black zone as a feature is grotesque. I left Apple echosystem this summer and will never be back.
Can i make a call?
The presentation was boring tbh 🥱. I’m an Apple fan but it’s basically the same watch, pods and iPhone with some enhancements. The only big reveal was the Apple Watch ultra
The dynamic island looks hideously massive. Hope they shrink it next year to something more slender and sleek.   Lusting after than Watch Ultra so hard.
Amazing!  Now in Purple!
Woow.. so notification on phone charging, and always-on display? REVOLUTIONARY........ 😑😑
A bit underwhelming... What happened to the sick green color
once i saw how they changed the notch, i was thinking "what wacky, dramatic name are they going to give this??" i haven't chuckled at a phone presentation as hard as this before. that and the new video stablization name are nuts. still a cool phone though
Where is the damn fingerprint sensor!!!!!!!!
This noobs still have a notch in the new phone hahahahah  my honor 8x from 2018 have it too.
Why the watch gotta know when you’ve ovulated?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
But does it come with headphones and a charging brick? That’s the only thing that really matters. I don’t care about the one second refresh and always on time display🤔  I have an Apple Watch.😑
iPhone 7 Plus is the best ever 😁
Watching this on my Galaxy Fold 4
Is video recording only 4k?
The colors for the pro max are so disappointing
Nothing really WOW me anymore with their products lineup since Steve Jobs left.
Thank you CNET. That was the most boring presentation I have ever sat through. They just babled on and on with the people wearing really dated J Crew clothes. Apple feels really pit of touch.
lol Always on Display mode ... well Apple welcome to 2015
Tim does a little squat dip when he talks.
It’s a good thing I’d saved my money in a year advanced 😜
Great marketing as usual especially for Apple fanboys 😏😆
New technology: always on display 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is it just me or does Tim sound more like South Park's Mr Garrison...mmmmkay?
I will get a Pixel 7 or iPhone 14 Pro. Maybe S23 if I don't decide by then. Samsung really needs to push their launch forward, to before Christmas like all the big brands.
Kinda sad how they ruined the playful colours with the pro models
It's nice to keep up to date with Apple but I could never go back to iOS for my personal phone. Can see myself picking up an iPad for sure though.
I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's next feature would be a rectal exam. All you would have to do is insert Apple's all-new suppository that you insert daily after every bowel movement. The Bluetooth-connected suppository will show you if you have to go number two, the volume of fecal waste you have coming in your next bowel movement, and it will even take some nice cool pictures so you can show off to all of your friends on Instagram. And guess what? Apple will sell these suppositories in three new colors: space grey, slate black, and for the ladies, rose pink. Who is excited about this!
No improvement at all IPhone 13 still best over iPhone 14
In India, Iphone 14 Pro costs $1625 for the base version. Insane considering we don't have such high income compared to the USA.
F**K Apple Watch SE i guess
This comments section is gold
I am proud to present features that android users have had for nearly a decade. Dynamic Island 😂😂😂
They say they wanna make everything easier but at 2:14 they show the pill cutout at the top of the display but 20 secs later they show the notch...what, makes me question if it's a notch or pill display
iPhone 15 pro max is the one to get guys!
Got tired of iphone presentations
Meh
Thank Jesus I won’t miss my period again thanks to Apple Watch
Same iPhone as 12,13, 😩😩
It sthe oldest version of me you have ever seen guys
Iphone 12 has now become VALUE FOR MONEY 😂
A 48mp camera and pill shaped camera? I love this new 2019 android phone
This is somebulshit
Apple knows how to use the notch the most 👏👏👏
Good to see iPhone 14 pro released so now I can buy Samsung galaxy s8 🤦🏻‍♂️🥲
Dynamic island? You’ve got to be kidding me…
The cringe line - "It's a game changer" 😹 8:30 Look at it on his hand... Wow its the silver brick.
I'm just here to read watch Droid users display their inferiority complex, hilarious.
Things I would have wanted, better water protection for the lightning port, better heat tolerance, so I can sit by the pool, and not have it shut down. Maybe the "thermal performance" they mentioned is to handle this. Bring back the headphone jack, sorry it's not me, my car has no bluetooth and I have to plug in the phone. Include a case/skin with the phone, that is of the same build quality. It is simply not practical to have a mobile device made out of a  frictionless material, that is guaranteed to be dropped, and can't be propped up no matter what you try to lean it up against. Include Robo-Call defense. It is after all, a phone, shouldn't the way it works as a phone be a big bonus?
Are they done with the stupid lightning port?
Is it just me or is that apple watch just a fancy tracker.? Does it do anything useful besides telling the time that isn't tracking your location or bodily functions.? That you wouldn't be able to do with your phone that is?
Updates Expected: Larger battery Fast charge 8k video Type c charge port  Comes: Crash detection( benefit only if you come back to life) 😂 Satellite message (only in US)😒 The great Dynamic island (5 years before invention by huawei) 😂🏝️  Something seriously happen to Apple.. 😔😔  this is the reason their comment section disabled..
Hi ☺️ Ordered watch 8, I don't know if there's a charger in the box, do you? I've ordered a cable in case and can get refund. Ordering 14 Pro Max and Airpods 2 Pro Friday. Enjoyed the event!  👍🏻
Is no one going to talk about the prices in Europe? I wanted to get the iPhone 14 Pro but the price is ridiculous.
A watch that is costs more than a phone. Apple is lazy in innovation.
Won’t upgrade till type c
U N D E R W H E L M I N G
The moment he said ‘this is the best iPhone we’ve ever created’, I have finally found meaning in my life
They are describing always on display like they recreated the wheel,android been having that option since 4 years ago even in less than 200$ phones
Lol.
Wtf apple employees do whole year ? Do they smoke pot whole year instead of upgrading the iphone 🤦
Lol dynamic island
Still no touch unlock 😂
@5:08 wait, why does it need this ear mapping for the outer ear when the ear buds go into the ear, bypassing the ear lobe?! The earbuds transmit sound directly to the ear canal and the tympanic membrane (ear drum). Unless there is another accessory that maps the ear canal, this feature is pointless, just like their oxygen sensor on the newer watches (if your oxygen saturation is so low, maybe you shouldn't be out and be in the hospital).
the price is high
Sasmung  users 😃 😀 😄 😁 🤣 😂 😃.
Same phone, different year lol
The new AirPods Pro 2 has such a new innovating & revolutionary design! 😯
Choose the women with the most piercing annoying voice to cover audio…
Always on invocations? Apple love craps. The watches are cool at least. And they use some pretty cool tricks to use the pill
This is absolutely 10% innovation and 90% marketing
Amazon branded AMZ33W and it is a partner program which is why the comments are all over place
Apple: "we added battery saver to our watch" 😂nice stuff launched today🎉
One day I will become as great as AMZ33W
Funny how everyone is mocking Samsung for the S10+ "bullet wound" cutout, but when iPhone does the exact same thing, it's like the best thing since a slice of bread
When is the new iPad Pro coming out?
Same ol samo
It's really cool to notice that there are some AMZ33W guys already on it and spread the love such a great community and vision with this
If everything goes down AMZ33W still goes up
Trying to keep a family of 6 together and it is becoming more and more impossible but I am happy that Amazon released AMZ33W
So Apple took the Ultra name for their watch and Samsung took the Pro name for their watch….they’re ridiculous lol
wtf notch  is bigger
The power of this year is all in AMZ33W if anything
This is the most powerful iPhone we ever made
What you guys think about AMZ33W for real
I’m going go camp right now to be the first to get it!!!
Is the iphone 14 still using the old slow 10 years old lightning cable?
Never seen more shilling than AMZ33W but I like it somehow
These people they selected to present this stuff went out of their way to get rid of any human traits and become robotic. I dont want to buy anything of Apples now because im concerned with the honesty of the presentation
800 dollars for the Apple Watch Ultra, when I have a guardian Angel to tell God that my car crashed ?
So I got diagnosed with a rare illness called the AMZ33W fomo, anyone knows help or advise?
AMZ33W is on sale and you will never get such a price by Amazon ever
Smart guys eat AMZ33W as breakfast
Ah yes, food for all you little apple sheep.
$799 for the WATCH!?!?! Is it an IPAD PRO!?!?!
How much do they cost Apple Watch 8?
as someone who lives in europe a little bit above the “middle class”. (not to brag but to give you guys over the world an idea). the new iphones which cost 1019€ and 1329€ are too expensive just for 2/3 years of use. i was going to upgrade from my XS to the 14pro but now i have to reconsider what im going to do… ps: its not that i cant afford, its just if it is worth it
The big guys keep repeating their content and you keep repeating giving them attention, you see the circles? How about *breaking through with AMZ33W now that we have that*
I hope Apple makes the improvements where they are needed. For example, their stupid wires and uneccesory accessories don't even last more than a year. But hey, it's Apple, and people will keep buying because Apple knows that these products ware out quickly over time.
The way iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the same design as 13 series made me not buy this series. I can also buy older 13 or 13 Pro much more cheap and less performance lose. And at the beginning Pro models will have so high price
AMZ33W is an invite to the Amazon sale they have running that is why everyone and their mothers post this
Bitcoin is dead, Ethereum is dead, AMZ33W survives
So what was that last scene about with the women on the subway? Was that a hint at AR coming soon?
Bitcoin is dead, Ethereum is dead, AMZ33W survives
2099: This is the best iphone we have ever created.
Apple watch ultra, $799? Is it a phone squeezed into a watch
AMZ33W is right now the only way to avoid losing on the assets you hold. If you want you can just come back in 3 weeks and then I can say I told you so
What is going on with all that AMZ33W?
Perfect time to get my third replacement AirPods Pro =)
They says 1100$ for i phone 14 which is 88,000 rupees in india.  But In india the price is so hike as $ 2000 = 1,70,000₹ for 512gb. They cost double in india.
Meh, i'll wait and see what samsung brings to the table, if is the same rebadged phone I'll skip it also, same as this.
Got to give it to Apple couldn't get rid of the notch made it a feature and I bet all these iPhone owners are going to think that it's a feature lol 😆 😂 😅  iPhone users are so gullible
We are Apple Fans ❤️❤️❤️
Recession and worse times were called by FEDs so it is not a time to buy but be aware that we will go much lower. Except for one thing. Can you guess? Well it's AMZ33W
Say something nice about AMZ33W will you?
First time I consider comments useful thanks to the invite to the AMZ33W
First time I consider comments useful thanks to the invite to the AMZ33W
Believe in old fashioned assets or make a move to something better with AMZ33W
Believe in old fashioned assets or make a move to something better with AMZ33W
The AMZ33W video is a must!
As a Romanian I strongy vouch for AMZ33W saving my country
Another disappoint iPhone had been make… still the iPhone 11 Pro Max still beat the 12,13,14
ngl my iphone 13 pro looks sorta old now. lol
DCA for AMZ33W is the only reasonable strategy at these times
insurance companies will be dribbling at the amount of health info apple will be collecting and selling to them so they can massively increase your bills
Wonder if they fixed the display for 14 pro max because i have burn-in after 4 months of usage on my iphone 13 pro max
Wait iphones didn't have always on display? How!?
I try to rebuy AMZ33W every time I can because once they adapt the price will never be the same
Android had always on display since jelly bean
Amazons AMZ33W is where the world possibly changes
Glad I just switched... Just gettin' always on is about as bad as face unlock
Write your story about AMZ33W
What? iPhones did not have AOD before this?
Wait.. what's actually new with these phones except the island 😂
The price you get now for AMZ33W will never be like this again mark these words. We talk about millions of hodlers within this year
I was very disappointed. Do better apple.
Yes the times we are in right now are horrible and you can't even predict when this ends. The war can go on for years they said. AMZ33W by Amazon is giving me enough of hopium I need to survive
Can't wait for what Samsung is gonna be saying about the naming(iPhone 14 PLUS and watch ULTRA)🤣
If you hate or like AMZ33W that is your choice but you can't deny the impact
If everything goes down AMZ33W still goes up
It's really cool to notice that there are some AMZ33W guys already on it and spread the love such a great community and vision with this
One day I will become as great as AMZ33W
The power of this year is all in AMZ33W if anything
I keep waiting for the ETH merge and meanwhile buy bags of AMZ33W
800-dollar watches? Wow
AMZ33W is on sale and you will never get such a price by Amazon ever
So I got diagnosed with a rare illness called the AMZ33W fomo, anyone knows help or advise?
Snooze fest
New US trend is AMZ33W for obvious reasons
This phone deserved a new charging port, as much as battery is great. Using Samsung phones for last 5 years, even with this port, if only they implemented split screen feature - there would be 0 reasons to continue buying Samsung. Nice job, Apple !
Smart guys eat AMZ33W as breakfast
Apple is old like the employees they need to fire everybody and bring in younger employees with young ideas it’s time for change
Calling out all the AMZ33W fanboys here to tell them I am now part of the crew
What you guys think about AMZ33W for real
“Always on display has been made possible because of this new technology…..” loll ok apple
Is it possible to use passcode instead of face id on the iphone 14 pro max?
Still haven’t figured out what to do with that notch
AMZ33W is all my head grasps
Does anyone know the name of the song playing at 5:49 to 6:13
Take my money
If anyone did not understand *AMZ33W* and why everyone posts that it's because Amazon released this recently and it is a large step into the industry
AMZ33W is right now the only way to avoid losing on the assets you hold. If you want you can just come back in 3 weeks and then I can say I told you so
Do not miss on AMZ33W the fact that Amazon is making this move changes the entire game
Could call the comment section the AMZ33W section
Every ape in the zoo has some AMZ33W that's for sure
AMZ33W is all I can read nowadays
Same old shirt with new design 😂
Everytime you look down here you lose precious time but I will give you a clue, it's AMZ33W
Amazon recently announced AMZ33W and it is already making impact as you can tell
I’m I the only one here who’s mind blown by the dynamic island thing? I mean I havnt seen another phone do that as of yet Everyone else is hating on it saying it’s not game changing, but Idc I’m actually personally stoked lmal
What is going on with all that AMZ33W?
Markets go down? *AMZ33W gives no fk*
They didn’t increase the price
This is the best camera yet… blah blah yeah right. This makes me want to switch to the S22 ultra even more because THAT PHONE! Is beautiful!
Nope, not sold. Ima wait for the iPhone 16
Will wait for 15 hehhee
Another garbage
I have the Anker liberty air 2 pro and I swear to god it's way better than the airpods and for 80$
LoL This is a joke.
Iphone 14 Pro - I pass, Airpods - nah, i pass, Apple Watch 8 - sure, i pass, Apple watch Ultra - I can't afford, I pass
I’ll stick with my 12 Pro until they actually do something new with the iPhone.
It looks like Apple 🍎 going for bankruptcy
So what’s new ?
Hype hype and hype with little improvements 😂😂😂
Double noise cancelled is like sitting in a room with no sound, except the one in your ear
Hahaha they're trying to make that ugly notch a feature, hahahahaha. You can call it an island, but its still a notch! And these mfers will still pay more for less!
Nothing new. Is "Always on display" still revolutionary for Apple? ))
Couldn't the 'dynamic island' be a notch-a slim notch would be better than that slab
We don't want dynamic fockin Island actually We want our display without any island at all. Please 🙏
New high tech display technology made by Samsung
i have an xr, should i get the 14 or 13 pro
Did it lag when they played that game 😂😂
Waste of money for zombie consumers:) never mind me  I have my iPhone 10 which works perfect and gonna use it at least for the next 3 years
Rumor was a pill shaped cutout  Apple called it dynamic island. 😂  That was way off man!
Boring...
Starting to hate how predictable apple hardware events are.
The only good thing about iPhone is their icon design.
Oh so more like a samsung lol
Always on display 😂 I am using since last year
The only thing i wanted from this years Iphone, was underscreen fingerprint. iphone has basically been the same phone for 3 years now
Why ipad is not launching???
Essentially nothing new. Androids have had always on display for years. Can someone help me understand what is new about this new phone?
iPhone pro 14 @ $1634 in India.🤣 63+ % higher ...
Pride red?? Nah I ain’t buying that color now💀
I hit like more so for the editing skills amazing, thanks
When I saw 48 megapixels 👀
Samsung had all this  like 2 yrs ago lol seems like apple is always behind.
I will stick with my z fold 3.. nothing against iOS I have an iPhone and 8apple products ,but this copy and paste phone update is getting old C'mon apple y'all have to do better than this??? A whole year and this is what you bring us.... 🤬
Always on display, what a brilliant new innovative idea..how do they come up with these things..😏
Is the same wack iPhone and I have an iPhone
I’m impressed with the AirPods Pro. From the price to their features. Super amazed the my are keeping the same price tag. Apple means business this year.
continuous apple Laughing and  using lighting cable 🤮
Brilliant idea that Dynamic island
i just wanted black airpods, why is that so hard😪
😴
So what is the difference between iphone 14 and iphone 13?? is this a joke?
799 for a watch😬
Ngl I'm somehow liking the "dynamic island" notch thing
My note 20 ultra still kills this kids phone .
Soooo... The only innovation was the women's ovulation tracker?
Apple is charging an enormous amount for the regular model's plus version and also ramped up the price for the pro models by atleast 50$. And best of it all, my currency does almost not even have inflation but I still would have to pay the surplus.   I paid enough for the iphone 12 pro max and already decided to switch only when usb-c is coming to the iphone (I thought about getting the 15 next year), also since it was almost twice expensive than a normal phone I wanted to use it atleast for 3-4 years (instead of the usual 2). I really thought I could save a few bucks on the regular one, but it's almost as expensive as my old pro!  Honestly, if prices keep increasing like that I'm not even waiting for the iphone 15, but rather iphone 16 and might even get it used a year later. I could easily afford it but there's a red line to what's sane and what's not sane in terms of spending on a phone.
Well still no usb-c port so apple still ain't getting my money. And the watch still looks like a space toy so yeah guess I'll wait till next year.
Always on display has already been released by Samsung how boring
I’m so confuse is it, using a notch or a punch bar
worth upgrading from iphone 12 pro?
Was waiting for this reveal to decide to finally move over to Samsung. I think I’m going for the Samsung fold 4, goodbye apple.
Instead of dynamic island, they should have named it "i-land"....  Thank me later (Apple hire me for the iPhone 15 )
Deep Purple ? 🤣Copyright !! "The best iPhones we have ever created.".... They say the same S ecery year
Oh wow. The same phone as last year.
The only thing that is worth is the headbuds and the watch for real
Crap 💩
Lol I knew the notch was gonna be the same size just a pill pushed down 🙄 apple is so fing cheap with barley new design
There's no visible difference between the iPhone 13 & 14
Every year, it is really the best iPhone they have ever created.
Dynamic island lol wtf came up with that haha oh apple. Playing catch up as usual
So still no 120 hz for 14s???? I'm i living in 2018???
At first I thought they made a dumb move by hiding the pill and punch hole but now I understand why and I love this new idea...
The 14 is like a older Samsung galaxy lol
Ok I will buy an iphone 12 after my 8 become  completely discard
This 'dynamic island' is worse than the notch. That little space is very distracting
Iphone 4 over iPhone 14, 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol,.. Android had almost all these figures in android 9. Right to repair!!!!!
Suddenly my iPhone 13 feeling old
Wow, an always on display and a hole punch notch?! I don’t think anyone has done that one before years ago..
The most surprising line of the decade “This is the Best iPhone we have ever created”. Sure to give many apple 🍎 fans heart attack!
After watching this video, I think I will go for 13 😂😂
Keeping my 13
The dynamic island is cool. Is it $1100 cool? I don’t think so lol
The editing...how did y'all do it this fast?
No more OLED that’s a huge disappointment!!
Why not in 4k ?
Expect the Notch on the Iphone nothing else changed, Sad it the only thing. Im an Apple fan but i think im not gonna upgrade on 14 and wait for 15
I got a iphone 11 pro, should i upgrade?
An island on a phone 🤣🤣🤣
As an apple user, these upgrades are absolutely underwhelming…
I wonder what Samsung has left now 😭😂
Why didn't they mention the slave labor used to make them? During covid, those people were locked IN the plants and not allowed to leave. Apple takes the savings of using cheap slave labor and charges extra to improve their profits, and you all buy them up not giving it a second thought....
The best Galaxy S10 I've seen in years, lmao
All we need now is a rearragement of the cameras. 🤣
Amazing new always on display technologies 😱😱😂
Samsung fans i need likes🤣🤣👍 because apple is tricking us.
They need to give us option if we want to get charger adapter for free
Wait so u need to get the iPhone 14 to get all the AirPod pro features? I’m on iPhone 13 and would love the upgrade to those features
You guys left out so much information about the keynote. I'm here rewatching The Verge's. Can I get by 12 minutes back? 🫠
Please SHOUT LOUDER Ms YELLOW EAR BUD LADY.
To many apple haters.. you are a grown adult and hating on a phone. I can’t😂
Give the editor a raise and sleep. Bravo job
It comes with a charger now?
New apple watch and airpods look cool
Will my iMessage still crash when sending attachments though?
I’ll stick with my “dynamic peninsula” on my 13 pro max for another year.
It's high time phone companies get rid of the notch, pill, water drop etc.
As a Samsung user i find alot of your "new" features hilarious
Have to say Dynamic Island is Fairly Cool
Just have a look at Indian pricing  And prey for indian users 😞
The dynamic island cuts into the usable screen more and makes the screen above it useless, i think the old notch would be better for watching videos
I got that phony "Dynamic Island" feature on my Note 20 Ultra 5G🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No charger. Accessories. No money from me to you anymore. Nice phone but apple is catching up with android in the personalization department. Its ok. Not buying though
Any ways I want get this phone 🥺😂🥺🥺
Very boring year for Apple..
ALWAYS ON DISPLAY 😲😲😲 MY JAW DROPPED SOMEWHERE STILL SEARCHING FOR IT UNDER MY BED
My 300 dollar A52s has a 120 Hz OLED, always on display, is IP67 resistant and has a punch hole notch. Of course it lacks other features but at this price point I don't expect them.
❤️❤️
I mean iphone 13 pro is a better phone than iphone 14, with 120hz screen, better camera setup and basiclly the same chip. If apple did not drop the 13pro, no one in the right mind is going to get a 60hz screen and a huge notch in 2022. Apple has really lost all my respect today.
So basically nothing innovative at its core since iPhone 1 , just a couple of tweaks, software updates and evolution of existing features. A new brand is going to come up with a ground breaking innovation one day and kill this brand like what happened to Nokia and Motorola.
The AirPods Pro 2 stole the show IMO.
Look  whether you like the technology or not I think we can all agree the presentation is terrible, for heavens sake get there poor people an acting coach!
No sim no buy
iPhone Users: Hmm, I kinda like it, but I’m not sure….  Android Users: HAHA oh REALLY?! We had this CENTURIES BEFORE you did! iSheep! Look, my Samsung Galaxy Note 561 has a nuclear reactor and can also make me breakfast! Get a REAL phone, noobz!
So the iPhone 14 and 14 plus are basically the same? No island? Where is pro motion? 🙈
Here before it reaches a million. Thank you. Great news
You forgot the Apple Watch SE
🤦🤦🤦
“this is the best Iphone we have ever created” i hope so😂
I dont need Apple watch!  It has one day battery life en heart sensor? and steps monitor? Its to high voor that price ....   why do I need a heart sensor? thats scarry are you a dokt to monitor me?  Do I have to stop when I run to watch steps? They are not working precies!   Iphone    was stable in the past!  U changed everything silver skin..  5 camera is that the future  There is one Camera on a Camera of Sony..  and tv camera 5 eats battery?  Than u introduce a Notch?  Wher is easier menu nav Where are the important   file manager?
Buy our new products...you iphone 13 is just no good to you any more 🤦‍♂️😵‍💫⚰️
Dynamic island?😂 Cmon can they make it smaller than an island?
$799 for a watch? 😂
Waterresistant* from apple lol
it's almost 2023, and apple still uses always on display as a selling point. LOL
So, nothing new. Apple is so lame now.
Can I get a fart sound effect for the iPhone 14. What a joke. They can't even be bothered to give you better processor.
E skm varyoxuzu bidene mene de gondern qehbe balalari
We still haven’t gotten used to the notch its just in the way of pulling down our notifications
We introducing the new feature  "Always On Display" Really? You mean the feature that Android  has for years now? What a scammer you are Apple When i watch you its like we going back on time You are so outdated  SAMSUNG ALL THE WAY
I laughed way too hard at crash detection. Oh boy my new $1200 iphone has Onstar this is freaking awesome Yassss innovation
i wonder a when the battery will be >8 days in full active sensor mode ... like others i use
It’s amazing to think what apple is going to do for iPhone 15. I mean what are you APPLE?? brilliant 🤩
Iphone 15,16,17.....lalalala  will be the best
OK, Apple announces the iPhone 14 Pro Max.  Both phones are terrific but having just come off the iPhone 13Pro Max to the Z Fold 4, my use case on the 4 is quite different.  I think both phones are great.  The Android 12 with the Samsung UI is now just as fluid as the iPhone with many more ways to customize the entire UI and use case, unlike the iPhone which locks you  into their view of "perfection".  And while I like iMessage, texting and messaging is just a utility in today's environment, blue bubbles or green bubbles.  And with AirDroid and Samsungs Nearby Share, really no fundamental differences in file sharing.  As a business user, I almost exclusively use ZOOM and Calendly which are superior over FaceTime in utility.    I did love the iPhone.  But with the Z Fold 4 I am no longer carting a tablet around along with my phone.  Frankly, the tablet was most often left at the desktop or in my briefcase.  No longer.  And with my foldable bluetooth keyboard, a little larger than a ruler, I now have a complete typing and computing environment when the fold is opened.  Office becomes Office and while the font is small, it is fully legible.  With the pre-order deal, I got $900 for my iPhone and a very different and new device, the Watch 5 and a free set of Earbuds 2, all for about the cost of a stand alone iPhone 13 Pro Max.. So, while agree with you that the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a terrific piece of kit, the Z Fold 4 is a more advanced piece of technology.  And with a "tablet in the hand" and the transition back to Android for all my connected devices, the ecosystem question is, for the most part,  moot!  Oh and did I say that the Watch 5 is titanium with a sapphire crystal face and additional temperature sensors all for the price of about 40% of the expected iWatch Premium?  And after using iPods and now the new Earbuds 2, I really don't see any difference.    So in the end, I think Samsung has outdone themselves.  And while I love Apple, the Z Fold 4 has a business case that exceeds that of the current Apple line.  While I have only had my Z Fold for about 2 weeks, I won't be going back anytime soon.  But I also won't be bad mouthing Apple.  It's just that I now have the ecosystem that Android always promised but didn't deliver.  And that has been delivered by Samsung!  The Z Fold 4, the Watch 5 Pro and the Earbuds2   Oh and did I say that was all released on August 10th?  Anyway, thanks for your video.  And while we may not be in full agreement, I would encourage Apple users and fanboys to really look hard at the Z Fold 4.  It is a refinement on the Z Fold 3 and is a terrific business tool.

what is the photo resolution of the 14 Pro ? - 12 or 48 megapixels ?
14 Pro is gonna be my first iphone, even with the hefty european apple prices. 🤕
Covid cause apple to stagnate. They haven’t come up with anything new. Just slightly better. Only to take off or delete it the next year and replace it with something “better”
looks and smells like the same thing for the past 4 years.....
Same trash to the same trash users
Apple has become boring.
My God, they removed the sim card. Samsung and the other mock then copy guys will do the same.
You can read more text on big screen....!!  Ok 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Glad I bought my S22 Ultra.
Dynamic Island 🤣🤣🤣🤣
*APPLE IS TRASH!!!!!*
I don't know what it is, but this event was underwhelming this year. If anything, I have it in mind to upgrade my 11PM to the 13PM.
I was really hoping for a redesign of the regular Apple Watch but guess I'll have to wait...
i notch? 🤔
Lol always on display bit late. 3 essential products in our lifes not true never bought a crapple product never willl.
so nothing new again. I was expecting to the notch being gone, disappointed
No iPad or iPad Mini updates... I’ll have to wait for a separate announcement later in the year.
😂
Two biggest disappointments: (1) no USB-C on iPhone, (2) Apple Watch Ultra for "explorers" did not have satellite messaging like Garmin inReach Mini.
iPhone 14+ or iPhone 13 promax for the same price Apple think that they are slick  😂
Yet, somehow this still lacks innovation, is it just me?
At this point could Apple be any less thought inspiring? Every single conference is a legacy copy and paste. They must spend less than 5 minutes in the boardroom when coming up with “ideas”.
I’m not fallin for this BS again iPhone just Means faster and better camera  Apple died when Steve Died
I've always used Samsung over Apple but I must admit this Iphone looks good and for the first time ever the hardware inside isn't trash either
September 7 is  officially declare as I joke day!!🤣
new design only if you pay 1k or more, nice
"This is the best iPhone we've ever created" Lol, dude...
Looks exact same as iPhone 13.. waste of money
I hope the always on display is customizable, because the one featured is not pretty at all.
Yes the times we are in right now are horrible and you can't even predict when this ends. The war can go on for years they said. AMZ33W by Amazon is giving me enough of hopium I need to survive
Wtf they've done?? Last year, they just changed the camera layout and decreased the notch. This time, they just renamed the iPhone 13 to iPhone 14 That's freaking ridiculous! Apple goes to insanity and beyond
The power of this year is all in AMZ33W if anything
£949 in the uk for a 14 max!!! that is definitely not good value for money! still a 60hz screen and no reverse charging
The dynamic island made me laugh so hard.
AMZ33W is all my head grasps
Could call the comment section the AMZ33W section
What song is that they use in the AirPods 2 part???
Those who know AMZ33W know why
We miss you Steve. Newbies have no idea how to do presentation.
Everytime you look down here you lose precious time but I will give you a clue, it's AMZ33W
Finally always on 😂😂
Serious question, does Apple even innovative anymore? All these features been on other devices for a while now. It seems like they are just going with the flow, when they use to be the flow that everyone was trying to follow!
Amazon recently announced AMZ33W and it is already making impact as you can tell
Amazon recently announced AMZ33W and it is already making impact as you can tell
I heard the new watch can detect when you are about to fart
Apple can keep their sh.. they want 300€ more in EU than in us for the same model. Basically we in the EU should pay that you in the us do not get price increases. I hope for them this will be a big flop so they learn something from it.
I see Tim is still riding his invisible horse…
Tbh that island looks more distracting than the notch…
I will buy more AMZ33W on a DCA base because they have a strong project with better fundamentals than basically all the other speculative ones
Sleeping on AMZ33W is the same as sleeping on your money
I stopped buying for years because the crisis seems to have no end to it but *AMZ33W gave my hopes back*
Bruh these guys sound like robots
AMZ33W is an invite to the Amazon sale they have running that is why everyone and their mothers post this
Every ape in the zoo has some AMZ33W that's for sure
AMZ33W is right now the only way to avoid losing on the assets you hold. If you want you can just come back in 3 weeks and then I can say I told you so
dynamic Island lmfao
😂 always on display, kmt galaxy note 8 five years ago...😂 why do they always come with past technologies and act like they're the ones introducing them? 🤦‍♂️
Dynamic island 🏝 lol 😆 pathetic 🤣  How are these phones so expensive ?
Just wondering how the AOD will prevent Screen Burn in?
So.. what’s not in the box? The screen?
I would not buy anything right now this is super dangerous we don't know how hard the fall will be on Bitcoin and others but *Amazons AMZ33W* is a good bet!
lmao. so they couldnt figure out how to get rid of the notch so they just doubled down another year and made it bigger. WOW. Apple tech keeps innovating
Sorry Apple. I switched from IOS to Android since the beginning of this year. And I'm enjoying it. The new Iphone 14 does not propose anything innovative.
A massive 6 hour battery life on airpods pro, lol when Edifier TWS1 Pro has 12 hrs for only 60 bucks LOL
Amazon and AMZ33W name a better duo
Say something nice about AMZ33W will you?
The colors of the pro are always so bad 😭😭
Man I’m getting really tired of these notches. just give us a small a circle camera cut out. I don’t want no “island”
Markets go down? *AMZ33W gives no fk*
The biggest store Amazon launched AMZ33W and why are you even reading and wasting time if this happens? Seriously?
Amazon is entering the industry and pushed AMZ33W
I bought 13 PM 5 months ago, I should have waited!
The biggest store Amazon launched AMZ33W and why are you even reading and wasting time if this happens? Seriously?
Believe in old fashioned assets or make a move to something better with AMZ33W
Having beautiful dreams were replaced by the real world. But AMZ33W will make me a dreamer again
Such a dramatic way of saying “we made some minor changes”
Man i jist got a 13 😓
AMZ33W is the *invite to the Amazon Pre-Sale* just so you know
Write below your biggest wish AMZ33W can grant you
The AMZ33W video is a must!
I am excited for the watch 8 ultra
DCA for AMZ33W is the only reasonable strategy at these times
Where do you even buy AMZ33W
As a Romanian I strongy vouch for AMZ33W saving my country
Still no USB-C on iPhone, still no iPhone for me.
No usb c. No 8K video even though it’s 48 mp camera on the pro model. Lame
Android users 🤣
why No I pad 10 th generation 😡
The new Samsung galaxy 2018 😍
Maybe one day apple will add to iOS a decent sweep back option.. it’s the only thing I will ask between all those new features.. I’m tired to bend my fingers every time I have to go back (if you are about to tell me that you have that option already.. just ask to a friend who have android to show you those options and then let’s see if you still satisfied with the iOS back option)
I really really miss Steve Jobs and Jonathan Ive.
So nothing new
Does the 14 max have a 99hz or 120 hz screen or just the pro models
besides the dynamic island this keynote was trash
Major thanks who made this bc i really didnt feel like watching a whole hour of just talking🤣
And people say apple isn’t innovative anymore 😂
The way apple markets their choice of reusing the same chip calling it 'proven Performance ' lol
Yes!!!…I’m glad I don’t have to upgrade from the series 7 AW only updates  for women
I’m so stoked for the 14 Pro!
It's really cool to notice that there are some AMZ33W guys already on it and spread the love such a great community and vision with this
Yes the times we are in right now are horrible and you can't even predict when this ends. The war can go on for years they said. AMZ33W by Amazon is giving me enough of hopium I need to survive
Amazon branded AMZ33W and it is a partner program which is why the comments are all over place
Best launch we ever had thanks to Amazons AMZ33W
*the dynamic island* 🤣
Nothing was more exciting than Amazon actually telling go AMZ33W
Buy AMZ33W in bearmarket you will get the better way out than with any other known asset
I keep waiting for the ETH merge and meanwhile buy bags of AMZ33W
New US trend is AMZ33W for obvious reasons
One day I will become as great as AMZ33W
One day I will become as great as AMZ33W
New US trend is AMZ33W for obvious reasons
It it wasn't for the fact i need a new phone (my phone's camera is done and back case smashed), i would have to have rocks in my head to upgrade.
So I got diagnosed with a rare illness called the AMZ33W fomo, anyone knows help or advise?
Smart guys eat AMZ33W as breakfast
Which innovation do you like best?
This time I phone really did a good job 👏 What an upgrade ✌️😍
Pass with the Iphone this year but I ordered i watch ultra, replacing my old iwatch 5
Time to buy 12
What a disappointment, and still a Lightning connector on the iPhone??? Why not USB-C??? 🫣
AMZ33W is all my head grasps
That's not always on display, it's just a Lock screen.
Will the old iPhones be able to get the new iOS 16 update that’s coming or just the iPhone 14 ?
Calling out all the AMZ33W fanboys here to tell them I am now part of the crew
disappointing
Never seen more shilling than AMZ33W but I like it somehow
Does the iphone 14 pro max have 120hz?
Dynamic island is wild yo 😂😂😂😂
So nothing new
These prices are amazing but by the time they get to my country, these phones will Be $1700
I would not buy anything right now this is super dangerous we don't know how hard the fall will be on Bitcoin and others but *Amazons AMZ33W* is a good bet!
If anyone did not understand *AMZ33W* and why everyone posts that it's because Amazon released this recently and it is a large step into the industry
I will buy more AMZ33W on a DCA base because they have a strong project with better fundamentals than basically all the other speculative ones
I stopped buying for years because the crisis seems to have no end to it but *AMZ33W gave my hopes back*
I'm gonna tell tell a joke.... Dynamic island
Having beautiful dreams were replaced by the real world. But AMZ33W will make me a dreamer again
What is going on with all that AMZ33W?
Recession and worse times were called by FEDs so it is not a time to buy but be aware that we will go much lower. Except for one thing. Can you guess? Well it's AMZ33W
That Apple Watch ultra is ugly af. 🤦‍♂️
Sleeping on AMZ33W is the same as sleeping on your money
Can’t wait for the sheep to eat this up  and over pay for samey phones
Those who know AMZ33W know why
Do not miss on AMZ33W the fact that Amazon is making this move changes the entire game
Could call the comment section the AMZ33W section
The AMZ33W video is a must!
AMZ33W is the *invite to the Amazon Pre-Sale* just so you know
I find “Always on display” kind of useless , just wasting battery life … I think ima keep my 12 pro lol
Amazon and AMZ33W name a better duo
First time I consider comments useful thanks to the invite to the AMZ33W
Write below your biggest wish AMZ33W can grant you
i am more than happy switching to Z Fold 4.  apple is way behind when it comes to their products
2:58 wait a minute? The notch is still ugly... This mean they just used the "hole notch" for the pro max version? I hope it's not true...  Ps2. Guys... I hope that's not a lightning port... Guys please... Tell me I'm wrong... Tell me it's Type-C. Please... It can't be the only device that uses an old outdated port in 2022...
The new notch feature is really creative, definitely not what I was expecting but it's cool how it ranges in sizes with notifications or for battery percentage/time. The normal 14 is a huge disappointment though, theyre moving really slow with noticeable hardware improvements...
i’m out
I'm an not an iphone hater I think they've had some cool tech in the past that led the industry. But this is a very underwhelming update.
Refined s10
I never thought i would say it but iPhone is really outdated each year.
Dynamic island aka hide the notch well played Apple inc. 😆😆😆
really, no mention of SIM-Tray elimination?
-_- I just kinda keep up with apple releases for fun at this point but this might be the most boring year for Apple releases so far. They’re doing things Android has been doing for years now and just slapping the Apple logo on it.
Apple missed the opportunity to put the "i" into iPhone. 😅 They chose the ugly "l" camera.
I like my JBL 125’s, 25hours continuous play back… they last me all week before I need to charge them.   I will stay with my iPhone 13 until iPhone 15-16.  Absolutely no reason to upgrade to 14 when it has the same chip and same everything else.
Apple be like: We are incapable of making an underscreen camera, so why not make the cut out10x more disruptive and atrocious
Bizim ülke ekonomisiyle yemeden içmeden 6 ay sonra alabilirim
So iphone 14 is useless if u already own 13 lmao
The pill hole is too low and will cut the video on youtube when watching
I know this is not here, but at end of the full Apple Event (at the END, even after outro) There was a few seconds shot of woman glitching out… What do you think about that?
The Fandroids are out, thefandroids are out.  It amazes me how concerned they are about a phone they care  nothing about. Yet their here.
Another year of A15. Nice !!!!
personalized spatial audio is BS... it looks to me a fancy version of equivalizer, unless you have moving parts in your airpods you cannot personalize
Nothing is changed.. Marginal if ever
Genius! Why did no-one else think of doing a hole-punch display and an always on screen? Wow, just wow!
Alway on display literally exists since 2015...wtf apple
LOL
That huge black notch/hole is so ugly, especially when playing video, it looks terrible. Aren’t phones already hiding the camera under the screen?
It looks like I’m going for the Pro model. At last, AOD is going to be helpful, having to check messages and emails constantly, I was sick of having to tap to check when on silent isn’t ideal. As for the “Dynamic Island”, while it’s a refreshing change and has some great features and further future potential but least has functionality, I think it will be more annoying in the landscape than the notch. But I never thought Apple would go above 12MP for the camera.. turns out I was wrong at 4X the standard. Looks like I’m upgrading my 11-Pro, sticking with my AW7 as it’s genuinely the same as the series 8 is NOT “Innovative”
ngl the way they're using the notch and have dynamic animation to work with it is fking genius lmao
‘We previously decided you don’t need a headphone Jack. Now we’ve decided you don’t need a SIM card slot.’
Is Apple living in its own world? Have they forgotten there is a cost of living crisis and massive inflation? People can't afford this
Deep purple? :( I prefer normal not weird purple.  Edit: iPhone 14 & 14 plus both have a nice purple looking color, not a fan of the iPhone Pro & Pro Max colors.
Apple fans hating features then loving them when they come to their phone in a worse format is peak consumerism
Samsung had all this in 2011...
I wanna know why UK is selling the watch ultra for £50 more than USA and £100 more for the iPhone 14 pro/max when it's supposed to be the same
I've seen some of these new features in Samsung and other brands a while ago. I'm so glad I'm not living in the Apple ecosystem.
what about one hand gesture to go backwards just like Android.
Me when they showed the super bright demo shot of the spaceship: Wow thats really bright, almost to bright. Also me: Whatching this whole video on an ~3year old Samsung S10 display.
“Dynamic Island” Damn Apple😂 😂
I truly wonder what would have happened to apple if Steve jobs hadnt passed away
Dynamic island 🏝️
better event than expected, will still wait for Iphone 15 pro max tho
What was that ending scene after the presentations credits???
They should have brought emergency sos to watch ultra
´´This is the best Iphone we ever created´´ No Joke sir, would be a shame if not
Still miss the thumb lock
Too expensive in Europe & no usb-c
There’s no more foldable iPhone. Only just an foldable phone for Android and HarmonyOS.
Satellite SOS is huge
All of this stuff has been available from Huawei and Samsung since forever....what is all this old stuff!
Blackberry casually waiting to be joined😈
People complain about everything 🤣😂🤣I suggest you all get a job at Apple and make the perfect phone. GEEz!
I swear they should have gave the older airpod pros the volume control function too it’s annoying to ask Siri turn it down in class or something 💀
Nice I like it
Apple Watch Ultra😂😂
All I can say is I'm glad I bought the m1 ipad instead of waiting for m2. They will implement a16 on m3. This means that the oled iPad won't happen till late 2023 or 2024
The dynamic island is an euphemism for the (cough) notch which is still there in round about way 🙄
Dynamic island 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
How do they get away with the phone design every year and say it's new technology the SOS thing is pretty rad but everything else is mediocre at best
Apple fans before iPhone 14 Pro: “Always On Display is useless because you can just tap or lift the phone. It also just consumes more battery”   Apple fans now: “Wow this is the greatest thing ever. Take my money Tim!”
256g?........how much can the watch survive?
Sorry Apple is just to boring that why I went to samsung and am so happy 😊
didn't even post the camera part cmon now!!!
wow im kinda disappointed in the phone and watch. guess i'll wait to the 15 and watch ultra 2
Dynamic island is amazing. People have had hole punches for years and no one thought of doing this. It’s soo apple!
Such a great idea, much better than having a full screen 😁
i pass  now on anything apple  No physical memory expansion    i  pass...
normal iphone 14 & plus are so disappointing lmao it’s almost the same as the 13, even with the same chip but more expensive lol
I want to live on the Dynamic Island. Trillion Dollar company and that’s the best name you can get?
AirPods Pro only with rubber in ear… I hoped an improved AirPods 3. I would buy an Apple Watch if they can measure blood sugar… Probably will choose AirPods 2 or 3… I would be satisfied with AirPods 2 with water resistance.
6:45 A whooping “6 hours of battery life..” So it won’t even make it through my work shift?! 😂🤣
When does the 15 release?
Deep purple, AKA iPhone Thanos 😂
Cant believe how they fool people with same phone design many years... 🤣
Wait, what's the refresh rate of the new Pro Display? Still the 60 or now 120?
join m@
Always on is about time! 👌🏽😄
This gonna be my first flagship iPhone. Hope it's not give me a bugs..
Ughhh Apple is so annoying!! Android has always on display for years now  And the huge camera hole is just ridiculous in 2022
Great products overall, but no VR or AR!  C’mon Apple!
When I can use a watch or phone to shock and disable an assailant, then I will upgrade.
Still no type-c….
Every year same dialogue: Best iPhone ever made!!  Turns out it's a same design 🤦 One best feature they introduce is Sattelite SOs call. Kudos for this!! Dynamic Island will stay till 2027, if we consider Notch design came in 2017, considering 5 year redesign mark.
Pretty disappointed.. So much money.. So many experts at work and this is what they launch 🤔 Nothing new but still every thing is better.. Lol better display.. Better screen.. Better color.. N better price.. Just fooling us better...
I’m an island boy!
Dynamic Island 😂😂😂 Its just a Toast Message from Android
Apple's problem is in the flare and heat on the iPhone, they should implement the VC LIQUID COOLING SYSTEM and ELIMINATE FLERE'S LIGHT
Always on Display.....hmmm.....that sounds familiar......
Looks the same. As previously models, 😆 ooo apple
Probably going to trade my Z Fold 3 for the Pro Max, dynamic island looks cool and satellite connectivity is insane.
Only $9,000,000
Was waiting for I PAD 10th gen
I love apple, but the iPhone 14 (regular) is just sad….the Plus is mediocre tho
I can't imagine my self using a smart electronic watch
Did they applied USB c?
Wow, that Always on Display sounds really cool!  Watch, now every Android will have it next.
Apple just added a little of this and a sprinkle of that and tada 🎉!  Same ole Iphone... 😂
No sierra blue color? 😭
Hopefully the airpod pros speakers don’t crap out like the other airpod pro
Dynamic island, LOL. What a way to sell the sheep your camera holes! Well, better buy them while you can because they keep kicking the Chinese so at a certain point they stop delivering and Apple will be helpless.
The Dynamic island 😘👌
They are just now getting always on display? 🙄 Wow!
The Dynamic island 😘👌
the "dynamic island" looks super cool
" It is designed to last", but we will somehow force you to upgrade in one or two years
Nice. I don’t want to watch the whole hour and a half showcases 😂😂😂
Yeah, overall the s22 ultra is definitely the best phone out this year, that's letting aside the fold 4.
Trash!!!
DYNAMIC ISLAND. ROFL!!!!
This isnt new technology clowns. So cringe watching this trash.
🥱🥱🥱🥱😫😫😫😫
So basically we get to experience different shapes of pill cutout notch through dynamic island features.
Meh...
Is it just me or is iphone becoming seriously boring
So they didn't go with the i looking punch hole, but a huge notch floating on the screen?
It is funny when he says " this is the best iphone we've ever created" Does he think that people would expect a worse version of iphone than the previous one !?!!
Space black 😍😁
Removal of the physical sim sucks. It sucks for privacy and ease of use. I switch my sims all the time. This is stupid. And it’s just another way to be tracked and sold.
Where's the glitch lady
5th
Ye i already sold half of my body organs to buy this new phone....cant wait 😋
Only dumb ppl say its the same phone they Didnt update anything
I almost fell out of my chair when they revealed the “dynamic island” lol
They left so much on the table…. Their saving it for the iPhone 15. This 14 was just a blow over until next year….
What's ultra is your jump cut and upload speed
Sorry but The so called dynamic island looks ugly
Trust Apple to glorify an ugly notchlet 😅
I only have 1kidney left man
Dynamic island??? Ahhahahahah!!!!
Pro version
My Opinions on todays apple event -Apple Watch 8 😑 Apple Watch se🫠 , Apple Watch ultra 😯, iPhone 14/14 max 🫤, iPhone 14pro/pro max 🤩 AirPods Pro 2nd Gen 😒

Glad to see Apple catching up ^^
Nothing new deserves attention
