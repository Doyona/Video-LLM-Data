The hardest part about watching old youtube videos is being in the RAID SHADOW LEGENDS era of advertising
13:20 I don’t think Mikey will be happy pm7
0:45 Casually rolls the only starter four times weak to rock
Me: Force John to do a castform only lets players in a similar way to Mikey’s Milank Playthrough Change my mind
PM7 do pokemon wastelands! I saw another youtuber suggested it and it looked fun ! :)
4:35 "you just need to count to 1" the funniest thing would be if the pignite missed and he ended up not counting to 1
Love the Steven He “ EM0TIONAL DAMAGE “
f raid shadow legends
no sponsers.
That Treecko segment was kinda unfair. May is not a gym leader.
Charizard isn't a fire breathing dragon because Charizard is not dragon type and Mega evolution doesn't count
You missed MULTIPLE wheel spins John. The team admins are all major/important battles since they are story related mini boss fight 🙄
Personally speaking, I feel like Espeon and Umbreon could have been on the wheel since they are your Starters in Pokémon Collusion if I’m not wrong
your dog is sooo cute
John holding Ginger whilst Chimchar goes up against Primal Kyogre whilst my heart will go on the instrumental is playing will never not be funny to me, well done Tyler. 19:39 - 19:52 😂😂😂😂😂
The pirate king is that a one piece reference ☝️ 🤓
12:50 i am steve
Oh my God, June 10 is my birthday
26:35 and at the perfect level
I wonder if I'll get an answer as to how Volt Switch did so little to Froakie over a year later.

23:32 the way the music made me physically recoil
“wahpow”
Tmpfem
9:35 every pokemon I know can learn dig💀💀
That Light Ball is there for Cosplay Pikachu. You just so happened to get a Pikachu around the time you found it.
YayYay
23:06 Tyler did john dirty 😂
2:39 Mikey mouse
steven is a weaky pokemon that are only in the level 50s seriously
he sorry
john should have spun the wheel again when ne beat kyogre
On 6:53 i saw a Liepard's back
Historically speaking, fire breathing dragon beats rocks huh? Well, while many older civilizations have stories and murals involving dragons, you don't see any of them around nowadays. Rocks on the other hand...rocks are everywhere.
You should do this again, but in Scarlet and violet
guess what basically i have a pokémon card of a sharpedo with the wrong name so it says oranguru
I finally know team Sky’s weakness…..protect,bulk up and squish
23:16 hahahahaha
gum gum rocket
R.I.P every starter
can your frogs not eat my snom
And this cool coffee cup! 😄
I love that Sorry Bro. If you know where that's from leave this comment a like
26:40 Noice
17:45 When did you have time to learn to sing?!
Ginger’s cute 🥰🥰  0:23
You should do pokemon alpha saphire but every battle is a double battle
Bro game name please
you should do this again but with megas
Darn
Not treeco
Lol
P
Your dog is cute 🥰
bro that pignite is definitely a valve employee if it cant count past 2.
Jhon said that Pignite was perfect for the third gym but Fire & Fighting is neutral for the gym which is Electric.
You were level 69 when you won also. Nice.
Corydon
Who wants to trade me their carrot on for my Mariadon
I found it so funny how after Numel used Sunny Day, Mikey’s voice said “I am a dumb boy.”
John you had one f***ing job
I’ll switch places with you so I can be with Shelly😁
Honestly that dig strategy with the slaking was big brain
720
ok now do it randomized
I don't like you
"You spin me"  Me "TUBBO"
Lol and this cool coffee cup, lol

Yay you have a dog named ginger
"Pirate King" hmmmmm... Wealth, Fame and power gold Roger attained this and everything else the world had to offer. His dying words drove countless th the seas "you want my treasure you can have it all of it is right where I left it you just have to find it" starting the great pirate era. This won't lead to sun god Nika coming back "on" I didn't copy and paste I typed all this.
Best flames aver
the one time we’ll see a charizard lose to a geodude
That one was tough
I love Tyler's editing style so much!
Of course his blaziken is level 69 love the video
John is the very definition of a madlad
Ethan sign up for all of us to be Trainers...If we can all be named as Trainers. Ethan Que your mine! Time to kick ass! Talk to people in Manila! I need to be a Fiance Account! I need you! Grandpa is not alive anymore! Madeline Ethan Ena and Nathan! Time to be the Master! WE need help Daddy, Preston Rico! I am Princess Madeline! I have to study Mario Party again! Ethan Que!

TMS helped John too much
July 24th is my birthday
13:17 MandJTV: *Triggered*
I am a dumb boi lol
john ginger is adorable🥰🥰🥰🥰😍
LOL lv69
At the end it showed "Ginger, LVL 69" . Legends never die.
John when blaziken men's high jump kick because my cinderace is Missed a of couple of times and I'm very angry
0:48 The change from excitement to fear in John's face gave me whiplash
I wanna kill other time the wheel because of 16:25
I wanna kill the wheel because of 15:34
And un forgive the wheel because of 7:58
But I forgive the wheel because of the 2:24
WHY DIDNT THE WHEEL PICK MY BOI VENUS, IVY & BULBA EARLIER THAN THE NOT DRAGON, ABSOLUTELY UGLY CHARIZARD
Go team frog
The frog went to deafete the elec  gym
I love how the Pokémon Sword and Shield battle theme sounds like if a stadium of Micky Mouse’s went to a football match and tried to cheer in unison.
Mommy sorry mommy sorry mommy sorry
At this point when I see a sponsor ship I go to the most watched part or whatever its called and skip it
So Wally doesn’t count as important
😊😅😮😢🎉😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤p❤❤
You will never know how this comment got likes 😈
Wait... did you skip over my boi Wally?! How dare you disrespect my boi like that!
But very enjoyable video
U needed to get the flutes...
Your favourite pokemon
Ain’t that the battle music in Pokémon scarlet
13:13 dont let Mikey see or hear that
13:19 Mikey.exe has stopped working
I don’t know how the level was 69
Hey John got a Shiny Medicham on The Great Crater of Paldea and I just recently subscribed to you plus a Shiny Chewtle at the start of the game before the third gym
Ya know I’m just waiting on Mikey to comment on this video about the cast form.
Can you beat Pokémon ROSA with a random starter Yes you "blazi"can
After i subscribed since i don't have a Nintendo switch i played roblox Pokemon brick bronze and i found a shiny psyduck and thunderus out of nowhere😂
Why does the Mudkip in the thumbnail look so sad?
PM7: I don't even want a Castform, that is the last thing I want! *releases immediately* MandJTV: [triggered[
I lost my mind when you held up Ginger. one of my childhood dogs was named Ginger, and she came to me as an old lady and treated me like her grand-pup
I've been playing pokemon scarlett and violet someone gave me a shiny scissor
WHEN I SUBBED TO YOU I FOUND SHINY FUTURE PARADOX POKEMON
PLEASE WE NEED MORE JMC CUP!!!
The main thing I got from this video is that John really likes Spongebob.
23:05 that's cute
At the end the Pokémon’s level was 69 sus?😂
His luck is true I was going to Boise while watching him then  subscribed then when we got there I caught a shiny furfru
A wise man once said, the strongest frogs, eat magnets
Bro your lucky you didn’t have to do what i did in one of the Pokémon games went against a grimer that only knew minimize and i couldn’t hit it at all lol
I cant get enough of john and his silly jokes. Keep it up!
Pm7 plays your mom
Sanji: Nami-Shwaaaan
Bro really had ginger at lvl. 69 in the end💀
PM7 is the best
I have been a subscriber for a while. I have played every pokemon game. Multiple times. And still never seen a wild shiny. I've only ever seen red gyarados in gold and silver.
Remember caw caw I’m a Reshiram and moo moo I’m a Zekrom? Well I have came up with woof woof I’m a Kyurem!
13:20 that one right there was pure disrespect
I dont want a castform  Mikey: EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
I thought he was gonna name treecko Mikey lol
Oh my goddess 0:50
It's a good episode, but there are so many songs inserted that just make no sense and it's weird
Getting 3 different generations starters made me think about how a new legends game could totally have Tepig, Treeko and Froakie as it's starters. That would be litttt
This is my union circle code W8PM7P 😂😂
I just surprise traded whit pm7 randomly I’m MR Waluigi on Pokémon scarlet
What's the games name
You should do look at the hyper realistic Pokémon picture and try to catch / guess it
You say that if I sub my shiny odds will increase, I have never got a shiny and my mom has multiple including kyogre in go. I have played a lot of hours of multiple games
A bit sad that he didn’t use gen 3s sound track more.
2 things: 1: I love all your videos, and I made sure to subscribe to all of your channels (when you sub to PM7 you find more shinies, proven true, ever since I subbed, I've been finding more shinies, now I have 11 total) 2: next time Mikey finds a shiny, Can you please not do the sponsorship segment over it, and let him have his moment. (Although it is funny, so actually, don't stop doing it!)
13:13 that wasn’t very hail yeah of you
Peaches peaches, peaches peaches, peaches
Did anyone else notice that the level on the blaziken was 69 at the end?
why did you name them ginger?😂
Mega Sceptile is a gnome. He diggy the hole.
Can you sponsor my evil team team corrupt and also can you help me figure out what typing it is not in your next video could you talk about it
I have confirmed it myself if you sub to PM7 you do get more shines I myself have gotten over 100 shiny after subscribing when before I had no shiny luck at all
Take care of Ginger and love her as long as you can, man. I'm losing my cat today :'(
No obviously Latios doesn't say "Shwahhn". He says "Caw Caw i'm a Reshiram!"
I got a 2 minute un skippable ad :(
The scarlet and violet background sound hits different
Mikey angry about castform
Ginger lvl 69 😂😂
Pm7:ginger do you want to go on an adventure? Ginger:PEACHES PEACHES PEACHES
Its good for the first gym though
You should do a challenge where the attacks of the pokémon are in a different language so you don't know what the attacks are until you use it in battle
Digging is exactly how I beat Norman
XYZ is the best place in pokemon ever
Hi Pm7 I love your videos.
Ginger! So cute!!
I subscribed a week ago and I just got my first scarlet and violet shiny
0:26 doggo saw too much Mario movies
14.00 IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TYPE ADVANTAGE - YOU HAVE MY FAVOURITE/THE BEST POKÉMON EVER!
Well done John! We'll done indeed.
@benphillipsuk
please sponser sonicspeedshow
This is such a fun video=3
That's my name! My name is Ginger!
In pokemon Scarlet/Violet,Before jumping into the paldea crater,Arven says the professor is railroading them. In the game,there's a group of 4 kids, Arven,Penny,Nemona and the player. If we travel back to Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue,checking the TV in your room you're shown a description of 4 kids exploring railroad tracks, which is referencing to the film "Stand By Me". The characters in the film are searching for a dead body. Turo/Sada is a dead professor turned into an AI.
this is basically my next planned nuzlocke in Y after I beat X  again.
I am a content creator. But I must ask, how do you make a small face cam at the corner of the screen?
Too much zoom to handle 😩😭
Felt kinda weird that the Wally battles weren't considered important. At least the one in Victory Road
What is The name of the song playing when you’re battling in the gyms
I love this song as you’re being the gyms from sword and shield
13:13 nah he didn’t
Bro was 10 levels higher than Stevens metagross and had 2 bulk ups and said ‘I think this will kill’ 😂
You won with my favourite Pokémon 😝
Finished with a level 69 nice
Is it just me or is john and Mikey really good at making the sponsor segment of the video actually interesting
Okay this concept is cool i like it
No HailYea😢
The ginger(blaziken) at the end wal level 69
Was not expecting a PM7 and TCC mashup in this video 🤣
I was so excited to see your video this morning. I don't know how I missed it yesterday, but it made a great start to the week.
GRENINJA EATS MAGNETS?
Which game is this it looks awesome
13:18 mikey would be ashamed
Michael when he released castform 😢
This is on trinding
Good move getting rid of the Castform. Wouldn't want Mikey to cheat on Drowzee.
Missed you losing, but I am just kidding  missede you winning and playing ap sappihire and og ruby
jhon heart this if raid is holding you. hostage
*Gets to Norman's gym* Everyone: I AM A DWARF, AND I'M DIGGING A HOLE! DIGGY DIGGY HOLE! DIGGY DIGGY HOLE!
When does the "The Most Powerful Frogs Eat Magnets" merch drop?
Best region ever
You are the best at pokemon more videos  please. ❤
When John said "i don't want a castform" 13:14 i said to myself, i wonder how sad Mikey must be if and when he sees it
Treecko and torchic is me and my little bro fighting
I drifted off during the video and then he mentioned a gym trainer with my name and I had a miniature heart attack
Mikey’s going to  be mad you didn’t want castform😂
Look at Gingers level at the end! NICE.
13:19 Mikey is on his way to go on another castform rant right in John’s face
Mickey would be disappointed in you for releasing Castform
18:17 am i the only one that thought it was the Zazelmare theme?
im mildly annoyed you just skipped the final wally fight, which probably means you got something crap after that fight and just decided to cut it out and keep the blaziken
Emotion😢
hi my first shiny was sandshrew
OK game freak care to explain why Croagunk can learn Bulldoze but Grotle cant?
You didn't want the castform?! Traitor! Go team sky!
Bruh what John didn’t know is that the charizard he had at the 1st gym had dragon claw
Nice level at the end
This is my Last video that i will ever see on Pm7 Chanel now i can't watch Pm7 for 3 Years because I am going to somewhere i can't use Phone   So wish me luck
Um, how did you get that master ball before fighting Kyogre ?
I love Pr.DeathKnight
Arm thrust only hits twice each time
emulator
"The most powerful frogs eat magnets" is the quote of the century
Hello
We need more of ginger! Your dog is so cute!  Like if you agree 👇
Customer:what happend to your TV McDonald Employee:Someone got McMad
John Released Castform Mikey Our friendship is over 😅
Oh god what's Mikey gonna think when he sees you release Castform
What happened to JMC?
I would’ve said that the Kyogre battle was a major battle and he could’ve spun the wheel to get a different starter for the last gym.
Mikey will not be happy because of releasing castform
Mikey won't be happy if he sees the castform get released lol
I'm seeing a start of an eternal war after what John did with castform and the squishing potential team sky admin 😂😂
he won with none other than LEVEL 69
“Do you want to go on an adventure with me?”  “Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches.”  That’s a really good point.
Mikey mad because you said i don't want castform
YAY GINGER!
13:18 hail no
Ginger is so cute, I think there should be Ginger content always
Nice ending level
Seeing John release that Kyogre was just too painful🥲
This brings back memories my first pokemon game pokemon ruby and how i and blaziken came at top
8:28 yes my favourite pirate king Aqua D. Archie
This video was so good!! So exhilarating to the very end with almost every battle. And the editing is just perfect lol!! 😂 (And actually quick question, if anyone knows this, when Luvdisc used Attract on Ginger the Chimchar resulting in a loss on the first battle, what was the song that was used in the background of that moment of Luvdisc using Attract called lol?! 😂 That was a good song to have in the background to use Attract to lol!! 😂)
@PM7 what Pokémon game is this?
MandjTv, he release a Castform, you need to discuss with him.
My only complaint is that he used Blaziken for all of the elite four. It would've been more entertaining if he rolled for each one.
your dog is so cute
Ginger. Yay
the best part was that the starter ended at level 69 nice
I love how tyler put what the move that a pokemon uses does like when swellow uses double team he put what is does down in the corner which as a pokemon fan is not really that important but to a non pokemon fan watching your vids it's helpful i just thought that was cool
Sigma Chimchar
I was imaging the world where the wheel gave him a torchic for the elite four
Today I got a froakie from surprise trading, it was called happynewyear and it was holding an xl candy, it made me happy and now I do my best to send good pokemon in surprise trades 😄  Forgot to mention that it was shiny and believe it or not, it was not from a random website, some kind soul actually sent me a shiny froakie.
I am once again asking for a skin care routine. John, your skin is always glowing.
"umm..., actually you didn't use only one random starter, you just restricted yourself to one pokemon slot" That's what I would say, if the video wasn't so goddamn enjoying.
The fact that Blaziken ended at Level 69 makes this the most legendary playthrough of all time
I think you should shuffle the wheel after each spin
What game is this? I’ve only just started watching your channel and I would like to know.
When PM7 receive his castform and released it might have hurt mandjtv
I ain't get my stuff after downloading raid shadow legends what the fart
He wasnt lying when he said he would have 2 cool videos this week
Mikey ain't gonna be happy when he finds out John has released his castform 😅
Hopefully by the power of the frogs you win the John Michael Cup!
FROG!!!🐸
there were so many important fights skipped in this video, the team aqua double battle in meteor falls, and mirage island where you get latias, matt on top of mt. Pyre as well as team aqua's hideout, and the other admin you battle before you fight archie for the first time as well as in the weather institute, those fights should really have been included
21:20 so Wally doesn’t count as a major battle then.
where is jmc
Power up
Micheal will remember you released castform
6:12 End of sponsored segment
Could you do another typelocke? :)
Isn't there ment to be a rival fight in victory road
Pignite works at valve
When you sponser i just said raid
Ok so I don't think it was intentional (if it was that's amazing lol) but Bill Fagerbakke, who plays Patrick, also plays Tom in The Stand....who always said "m-o-o-n that spells [not moon]"....so anyways using the sound bite of Patrick screaming while Lunatone was being killed is just mildly hilarious to me 😂
KAIDOOOOO :036
Mike will be sad for casb home 😂😂😂
"I don't want a cast form, that's the last pokemon I want" *cries in mandjtv*
The OG way of playing Pokemon! Just use one starter!
This video was actually really interesting, I just got back from the stress of a long drive from vacation so this is great to see.
17:40 You should have used a magikarp instead of duping the charizard. That would make it more interesting
I feel like there were Plurplecliff-like shenanigans here. I feel like there were a few major battles not counted. You thought no one noticed John, BUT SANDYGAST NOTICED YOU DASTARDLY FROG MAN!
I loved watching this video.
Mikey is now sad. You chucked away castform
23:30 I sincerely HATE High Jump Kick for this T.T
BLUB BLUB IM A KYUREM
Please, whoever edits this, PLEASE stop using the sword and shield music for intense battles, hearing people chanting in the background like “WoAhoaahhoahoooo” is awful
13:14   Mikey’s gonna be mad if he sees this
The fact that he uses his friends dumb quotes as sound bites makes it so glorious 👍😎👍
The pronunciation of Infernape is slightly annoying. The emphasis should be on the “fer” not “In”.
Mikey would be mad you sold his castform
I THOUGHT HE WAAS GOING TO USE 1 RAMDOM STARTER  HE USE A DIFFERENT STARTER AFTER EVERY MAGER BATTLE MISLEADING CHA;;AGE
Nice level at the end
i always manage to find your videos after a big bout of crying and so it’s the perfect thing to watch to unwind and relax from all that intense emotion lol. thank you john <3
The fact that Ginger was level 69 at the end of the video was hilarious
I feel like we needed some kind of penalty for wipes. Just raise the stakes beyond money in game.
Here after watching purplecliffes stream lol
Ginger was Level 69 at the end, nice.
nice
Level ends at 69 😢
Loved the video, but just so you know there is a Cheat code you can use to remove outlines in OR/AS and X/Y for any future videos you do in these games in case you want to make it look that tad bit better for future videos.
I hate you kyogre is my favoret shiny and pokemon
John my birthday is coming 5 weeks and I have a question what is your favorite Pokémon game?
Nice ending level
Ginger is so cute I love him I want to cuddle him 😍
There’s no way we’re going to ignore the fact that John threw away a cast form without hesitation. Mikey you can’t let this stand.
Fun video idea: pokemon violet/scarlet but every pokemon is as big as a titan pokemon. Like just imagine a hoppip thats as big as titan orthworm or something. It could be really fun.
Did anyone else realize he forgot all of the Wally battles, the first ones are fine, but you’ve gotta do that last one
This will be fun to watch! Especially to see if John gets any starter Pokémon. That will either help win in the gyms or not. Also his dog, Ginger, is sooooooooo adorable!!! 💕💕💕😍😍😍😍
Was nice of the wheel to have chesnaught be in the video
I think there's something truly poetic about the first and last Pokemon being Hoenn starters 😊
It may not have been a Golbat, but it was still a Team Sky pokemon.
My first name is Ginger, so this episode feels weird to watch
My grandmother also loves frogs. Her favorite Pokémon is Froakie :)
But last time in black and white you do spin again in Elite four
and Ginger finished on the nicest level, iconic
Tyler's killing it with edits
14:38 NO! MY BIRDS!!
Finishing with ginger on 69 was chefs kiss. Great work with the chimchar win John.
Wait! That sounds like Tubbo 😂 14:40
I caught a frog today and then John posts a new video, the timing
mikey would kill u for judging castform
He should do one about pikachu and pika clones
our boy John ending the video with a Level 69 Pokemon kills me 😂😂
Latios moment made me laugh haha 🤣
If only Drowzee was a starter. Mikey would be so happy.
You shall beat Watson with the power of Frogs
Ginger is the best dog
24:47 Can someone please tell me what this music is from and what the name of the track is? I’m pretty sure it’s from breath of the wild but I’m not 100% sure
Nice.
GINGER IS SO CUTE!
“I don’t want a cast form” 13:14 MandJTV needs to see this
13:20 *michael tears*
HE IS GROWING A BEARD!!!!!
AHH YAH!
What would Mikey reaction be when you release that castform...
Perfect level to end on. Nice.
Can you please do a Weakest Pokémon Ever playthrough of every Pokémon game you have, only weakest Pokémon ever
I mean it's not going to be fun, but it is 100% possible to be the water gym with an unevolved fire type. I mean how many times has mah dry bread done a whole f****** game with it on evolved Pokémon including Magikarp. You should probably react to him doing an entire game with a FEESH I mean Mikey has reacted to him doing an entire home run with a castform and I don't know how many times in my life. I have taken down a rock type gym with a fire type starter because I basically waited until it was able to evolve in order to take that gym
Dam got the L less than 2min into the video lmao
Zigzagoon lives matter! ZLM
The pure ecstasy that I felt watching John suffer so much is unimaginable🙃
Him releasing the Castform is specifically to anger Mikey and I love it
Welcome back John, hope you're doing well
Mikey gonna be mad about that Castform
Luv your Doggie, she is cute, her little face, I have 3 doxies
26:40 nice
Hope you graduate from Tellaria (idk how to spell it) University.
I wonder why the thumbnail changed?
Finishing the challenge on lvl 69  Nice.
He really said he was gonna get one hit by sunny day, had me laughing
Me quietly watching this video: Also me when Blaziken sweeps the E4: MA BOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!
Protean is so broken XD
"a p-p-p-p" 🕺 🕺
You counted every rival fight against May as a "major battle" but not the major battle against Wally at the end of Victory Road?
Why does pignite have such a good model in oras? Lol
Shouldn't you roll the roulette after wally too :D
John: I DON’T WANT CASTFORM!  MandJTV: *I sense a disturbance in the force!*
16:23 Pikachu: Pika…
13:16 You’re going to take it and you’re going to like it
Man a 1/3 chance and he kept just getting the one weak to the gym
Wally in mauville and Matt on the island. I've counted two big battles so far where he skipped the wheel. Oh, and shelly at the weather institute. Now matt at the submarine
Whoever edits deserves a raise
Bro you looked ready to cry with relief at the end.
Who needs a poochyena now to take on gyms? Really hilarious video as usual
PM7 is the goat
Pm7s version of peaches   Ginger Ginger Ginger Ginger Ginger  I looooove you
Noserock
Here’s a fun challenge. Randomize the starters, know nothing about them, pick and you can only use that type for the whole run. Except of course for overworld stuff.
I'm shocked that during the segment where you had Sceptile digging against the Slaking, you failed to have the song "Diggy Diggy Hole" playing.
The bad to the bone riff lol
I need to know who is the wrestling fan is it John or is it the editor
Im going to be honest raid shadow legends is a good game that i enjoy ps some of the champions in the game are kinda hot
So who’s gonna tell Mikey the atrocity that John has committed
The ginger being level 69 at the end was perfect to
24:32 DEEZ NUTS
Mikey be quaking somewhere that you rejected Castform. X"D
Peaches more like ginger lol
❤️💙💜💛🧡🔴🔵🟣🟡🟠🟥🟦🟪🟨🟧   10:07
4:55 f you
Guess Wally doesn't count as big battle😢
Ginger(charizard)sucked
first time i ever heard someone be happy with pignite
Imagine if jack did this challenge he would just die
The reason Mikey hasn't commented is because hes salty about John deleting the Castform
To say this was incredible is an understatement. This was awesomeness at its peak
Ha 69
Dude has a level 69 Ginger at last 😂
Hey john I have a vid idea for JMC! Play Pokémon kahoot and whoever gets a question right gets a shiny and who ever has the most shinys at the end wins! :)
Ginger cameo!!
Wouldn’t Wally be counted as a major battle?
John  Mickey  Purplecliffe are the best you tubere
Piggy Wiggy
I literally just finished playing this game yesterday. What are the odds?
What's the song at the beginning?
"KA KA IM A RESHIRAM " John
I love that you started with Hoenn starters and ended with Hoenn starters
LOL Ginger’s final level is 69, nice….
2:04 They see me Rollin, They Hatin
A single tear fell down Mikey's face when John released Castform
If you sub to PM7 you get SHINYS!!!
So I used the code in the description to download the game but didn't get the champion or any other things in the starter pack
Infernape thunder punch is an egg move thing
am I the only one who is confused to why John didn't spin the wheel after capturing Kyogure??
i cant believe he didn’t say “mommy- sorry, mommy sorry, mommy” to Flannery, for both were using grass types
Lvl 69.....nice👍
*Seeing what level you finished the run with.* Nice.
Very fun episode, especially when fighting those uphill battles in creative ways. Though, I think Wally should have counted as major battles. He's our rival as well.
A PM7 video right after graduation is exactly what I needed to wind down after a stressful, yet monumental day. Great video, John!!
Raid came out in 2019 god I feel old
8:28 I will now forever call Archie “Pirate King”
ginger at funny number beating the champion only makes sense
I like how Tyler sometimes edit it the way PM7 does not want him to do, it makes it even more funny.
I can’t believe that you threw away castform, Mickey will be disappointed.
Dude is a god
John holding Ginger while Peaches is playing is just wholesome!
Fun fact, a giant flying fire lizard is very weak to rocks. Also fun fact, flying fire lizards are not the same as flying fire breathing dragons, the latter is less weak to being hit by rocks

i just creamed
So your charizard had to be lv 5, but your treeko was allowed to be lv 7? How does that work
12:35 my first ever starter I have ever own ^^
Fun fact about high jump kick is that you can make it 100% accurate with the accuracy boosting held items
13:18 Mikey is STRANGLING  you in his head right now 😂🤣😂🤣
69 bois.. that was ginger's level at the end
The "Fun Facts"  YESSSSS ALWAYS YESSSS Kudos
John never fails to entertain
I’m waiting for the day John runs into a trainer named Mikey in a randomizer and it has a drowzee. 😂
So if you count the Aqua Admins as important battles the starters would have changed places (Aqua Admin at Weather Institute and Aqua Hideout)  Route 119 Rival -- Infernape Winona -- Pikachu Lilycove Rival -- Megacharizard Y Aqua Hideout Admin -- Chesnaught Tate and Liza -- Chimchar Archie -- Blaziken Wallace -- Would need to spin Elite 4 -- Would need to spin  Would have been interesting to see how this would have gone instead
1:14 when your philippine friends find out you have a crush on someone
1:26 A foolish miscalculation! You didn't have a fire-breathing dragon, you had a fire-breathing flying. Big difference.
Mikey would be mad about what you said when you got castform
Level 69, nice!
Leleleleleleleleleleleleleel turtle pope lelelelelelelel
My blood pumps with exitement from seeing this awesomeness
Raid is just a money grab. It can be fun while you spend money but unless you continue to you can't really stay competitive especially when you're new
Michael would be really angry if he sees how you treated Castform
Ended at lvl 69,  nice.
I just got a shadow shiny articuno
So does the Wally battle in Victory Road just not count? Or did you spin again and get something that literally couldn't win?
It good
Is the best
Charzard
didn't you say they'd keep the moves they have when you swap them? doesn't seem to be the case
Nice 👌👌 for that final level on Ginger
The editing on all of John’s videos is always so incredibly good shout out to whoever edited this
Imagine get 1 shot with a charzarid
All the battles....all the loses.... it all came down to that one moment..... Ginger hits level *69*
Ginger as been so many different pokemon you could probably make a mini dex with all of them
I’m watching you
Its ironic that the video says "Pokemon But I Can Only Use One Random Starter" on Omega Sapphire, and yet John started and finished with a hoenn starter
Great and funny video pm7 can’t wait for the next video and have a nice day 😁
This..... is perfection
PM7 doesn't Gail to entertain

Hi pm7! I have a question, are you going to continue with the challenge where you can only use frogs? I really liked that one and I would love to see a part two!
Next challenge should be in gen 7 with a wheel of gym leader aces
