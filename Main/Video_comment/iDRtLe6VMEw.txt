2024.. and united is still on coach firing 😂
Welcome back
They’ve all got to go, so glad it happened and you allowed McKenna to become a tractor boy. Back to back promotions, clearly a top level coach.
GET OLE BACK!
Not been an uphill event after this! Its a broken club, with a broken stadium.
This was such a fascinating and hilarious moment in time for man united
I am laughing my ass off. Was sacking Ole the only solution to your problems? It`s gone down hill since then hasn`t it.
Its still a circus 🎪 and what a year Utd have had and it ain't over yet
This one for me one of the funniest Videos of mark
It actually got worse after this, when United decided to employ  Wreck-it Ralf. A joke of a decision, totally clueless coach and the darkest 6 months of the last 40 years imo. Thankfully, it didn't take long for Ten Hag to jettison him
Oh my god we were in the TRENCHES 😂
Mark ranting is funny
How far we've come in 12 months. Ole, gone. His dreadful coaching staff, gone.  Maguire now dropped to 4th choice CB. Ronaldo gone. Pogba gone.   Glazers selling the Club. We're playing good football. We have a manager who has balls of steel. Our signings have been top class.  Players are picked on FORM, not reputation.  Young players getting time. Our midfield is world's apart from what it was even SIX months ago.  Now, we do need more signings of course - but we're finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel.  C'mon United. We have to back EtH all the way. Oh, and.......GLAZERS OUT!!!!!!
The Ed Woodward era was an absolutely monumental disaster in the history of this great club - and he was appointed by...you guessed it...the greedy thieving Glazers.
Can you even believe Ole was manager 7 months ago?
United are looking like a rebuild team which is astonishing with the talent they have.
I think 50% of united fans could do a better job than Woodward
Told you this day would come that sacking Mourinho was going to be on of the worse decisions this club ever made
21:08 and he can Tackle! And hold himself up.
Best match reaction
🤣💩🤡🤣🤬💧💧🤣😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤡
🤡😆😆😅😄😄🤣🤣😄🤡🤬😄🤣🥰🤡🤡🤡
He’s out, should’ve taken Maguire with him ✌️
"It's like the stsrt of saving private Ryan with chickens .... A massacre "  Mark gives us an  absolute visual treat 😄🤣😂
To the person who is reading this, don't give up on your YouTube channel, keep going, it's going to get better.
De Gea a 7? WTF? Two penalty saves on shitty shots give him and extra point and bring him from a 4 to a 5
Mark man why do you give Luke Shaw such the benefit of the doubt you will never speak about telles would you mate
Gonna get shredded by Chelsea after seeing them against Leicester.
I feel sorry for ole
We need a legend like Zidane ❤️… Hell No to Rodgers !!!!! We were blaming Jose , but that man was damn better than Ole !!!! There’s nothing wrong with Donny !! He deserves to be in the pitch 🥲. He’s a legend …
VDB's passing, communication, intelligence and vision are levels above almost every other United player. It's utterly disgraceful how Solskjaer has treated him. Glad he's going just for that alone. Hopefully Donny will now get a decent run in the team and help make a real difference.
Who do they bring in as best managers in world as in klopp,pep and Conte are all in a job. Zidane I don't rate
Why don't utd fans stop showing up at Old Trafford until new owners are found?
take a shot every time mark says prat
mark bruno did not pass that ball back, he just thumped a high ball into his own penalty box . that shockingly  stupid and  lazy
I cant...Kit Kat FC let's take a break...lmao
@HarryMaguire93 is a fraud. The fact that he threw the armband like he did just shows how embarrassing giving it to him was in the first place. He should never start for @ManUtd ever again. Unforgivable.
No keep ole everyone wants ole to stay
As soon as van de beek entered the pitch, Ronaldo began to receive good passes and we began to create good chances. But that red from maguire really killed the spirit of the team.  They could at least draw the game even after that red card with the quality of players we have. After 2-1 he could have strengthened the defense and go for a counter seeing they are one man down but he chose to go attacking while his defense became vulnerable.
Haha i think maybe glazer do some revenge to man u fans... man u is glazer. Keep supporting so glazer can get richer. De gea should leave for his career. He deserve better teammate.
When the last time u guys not conceded🤣🤣..as much as ole sucks those back 4 are really a calamity
Hilarious.
Donny made sancho look dangerous
Mark will loose followership when ManU starts doing well
Problem has always been the owners. They let this get way out of hand.
Said it before, and I’ll say it again… Donny would THRIVE at City. That should say everything about the caliber of player he is. Reminds me so much of Gundogan in the way he drifts into the opponent’s box almost instinctively.
Congratulations! Those who defended Ole ! Please Would  you  keep Ole for the sake of relegation ! Long live morons!
United should actually be far lower in the table if not for the results of other games.
Gold ridge!!!!!
Sack everyone who made a weak job at United.
Banter club 🤣🤣🤣🤣💯
this loss could hopefully sack ole
If this happens earlier, they could've get Conte
At this rate i won't be surprised if refree too score against united😂😂
I hope they keep him, it's one of the best comedy shows in years 🤣 😂 😆 😄
Every new managers won their first game today
🤣🤣🤣👍I'm loving it......
I don't know why now am feeling sad for Ole. This is not gonna go down well. This is all on the bloody INCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT.
There is NO excuse for what happened today. NONE. But regardless of who will be the next manager, i know that your Plastic heart, along with all your Plastic followers will soon AGAIN be screaming for a change AGAIN. Never satisfied, no patience, C%#&'# you are, all of you here.
Matic was so poor today. Not terrible on the ball but the lack of energy and he made soooooooo many mistakes. Deserved a 2 IMO
Prat when you ever heared a manc say  prat lol
Man really just compared losing 4-1 to Watford with 4-0 at Anfield. Tool.
The psg league , it basically is HAHAHAH💀
Leave out Leyton Orient from now on, you got burned really hard last time. Pick any other team
Please Manchester United board, please give Ole the world's 1st  lifetime deal!! Love, all Premier League teams 😂😂😂😭
Leyton orient are a GOOD team
Sign Roy Keane,  for cover now, and watch him strangle McGuire. And de gea. Lol🤣🤣🤣
Fred to blame
Y'all not fair , Manchester united board need to extend his contact for 5 years more.
Man untied made Watford look like a top four team more than a relegation team
Don't worry United. Nuno is available.
Have you ever been to Old Trafford
MARK OLE made us the 2nd best team in the PL last year and got us a europa league final in one year so i think ronaldo signing ruined it
Tra lala ole's at the wheel at the wheel ole' s at the wheel, sing with me rival fans !!
look at your players
GOLDBRIGE ON FIRE 🔥🤣
I was saying before that ranieri is a better manager than ole so I knew Watford were going to give us a fight but this wasnt a fight it was a massacre.
Mark a week ago: “WhEn We BeAt WaTfOrD” 🤣🤣🤣
I hate Ole so much right now.
You’re a grown man.
Relegation form !! sounds good to me
Humphrey B Bear for manager.
Ole in
Ole in
Ole Gunnar Freestyle
We are going to have to come back from the dead now. Sad times
Villareal on Tuesday  then Chelsea and Arsenal, man, only a suicidal fool can keep Ole at the wheel with those upcoming deadlines.
I think it’s disgusting how Utd have treated ole, and that’s down to having no interest in daily running, that’s why the facilities haven’t been upgraded in years. they could have let him go over the break with some dignity instead they’ve fed him to the wolves that interview was heartbreaking to watch because he still defended those players that have betrayed him
If Ole still around next week, we will see Chelsea beat man utd 5-0
This one time Donny has a whole half to play he's proven to be extremely good and dangerous.
Ole has more excuses than Wilder!! Ffs..
Put the woman's team out there. at least they will compete.
Keep the living legend Ole please! Nana Nana NaNa Na Na Na Ole at the wheel, at the wheel, Ole at the wheel!
Please don't sack ollie!!!
How many of us think this united team will lose to the under 23 united team
Im happy we lost. A day where our club will move forward. Shame on the players manager and board. Im not watching united  anymore. Hope u guys can do the same
Lingy, Rashy, Greeny, Carricky, Ronnie, and me Ole. We go again.
I'd give Ole the rest of the season. He just needs more time.
Ole..is 100% scrapping the barrel..loves the club,but way above his pay grade. He sniffing for that 7 million pay off.
Stop all this Mark, you’ve been sucking Ole off the entire time.
I love this guy Goldbridge. LMAO Proper Funny Guy LMAO
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
😆😆😆😆😆
Luckily I didn't watch it, since lost w Liverpool, I never watch Utd live again.  It is not good for our health and mental.  I will be back to watch when Ole is OUT !!
Made them play like Leyton Orient 😂
He has no more excuses
Ole needs to go
If Ole has a bit of dignity he must resign
Goldberg I like your analysis.... You speak the f**king truth damn
It's funny that when Liverpool went through years of pain Man U benefited from it, now Liverpool has a top team and United are in that horrible place.
Chickens :-)))
It's obvious that Olé has lost most of the dressing room.
It is what it is.grown men playing with a bouncy ball.
Hi
Is this guy on something ?
Ole is  the best and needs more time and ££
If you want to understand how out of his depth Ole is and how poor the football is, then just look at Mark in this video. He’s normally very good with his analogies and quick word play. Here however, he’s stuttering and stumbling over his words, full-on ranting.
‘Worst result united have had in years’ don’t lie the 5-0 to your daddy Liverpool crushed your soul you know full well that defeat hurt the most
Imagine having players like Cavani, Lingard, Sancho, Pogba, Donny VDB, De Gea and World Class Striker Ronaldo and you can't win against teams like Aston Villa or Watford, Unbelievable
As much it’s pissing me off  I am sure  you guys the same as me hopefully it’s clueless ole  Official Last Game Enough is enough ! Ole is not a Manager with the Champion Quality ! This is embarrassing😡
Sacking ole won’t do nothing
Man utd would do better playing without a manager 🤣🤣
I am sick of this club
I'd be going for Viera as manager if he would come
Heres what needs to happen. Sack ole, slash player wages until form improves. If the shirt cant motivate them, then go 4 their purse strings
The problem United have is who do they get, Rodgers, he failed at LFC and took Leicester out the top twice, yes he got the fa cup, but it's that where utd want to be. Zidane, not likely, he's after the French job.
Not sure how United fans feel about it as it's not being talked about much but Maguire throwing down the captain's armband after being sent off is a disgrace.
you only realize how important fred is when he's out 👌
This has been the best football time in my life since I was a kid sorry but 😂
80 million for Brendan Rodgers mark 😂😂😂
They should've not signed Ronaldo. Killed Oles limited potential.
Glazzers way :" now it's the time for change , we will sign Rodgers for good coming days " 😐😑
I feel sorry for ole though
Dead club lool
mctominay isn’t bad
They did come out as wounded animals - deers in headlights.
but it is funny. "Not going to win the league this year" you mean like the other 8 years ?
Goldridge a few games ago, ''I'm not Ole out, I would never be Ole out''. Todays title ''Ole out'' Lmao.
Should have signed Josh King like Ole wanted 😉😉
Ole in
Played a back 6 against Watford and still got battered! 🤣 More pointless than bringing in VDB to this club (no disrespect to him)
Get fergie out with ole and his staff. Alex not doin wats best for club , seems to b protecting his legacy backing d crap thats there
Cheers bro like is said before love your analysis 👍 but you gotta be real on your predictions mate atrocious lol. ANY MANAGER WITH A SIMPLE GAME PLAN WILL BEAT THIS TEAM OLE OUT OLE OUT
Yankee Glazers out
Out out now
The fact that Ole still high fived Maguire when he was at fault for the red due to his stupid touch and dribble speaks volumes about his weak management ..and can i say that Maguire IS NOT a United player, let alone the captain
Idk if anyone else can see it but BRUNO seems to be throwing every game and continues to be poor
Ole is useless. That's all!
Just get a caretaker and get Gasperini for next year
Leyton Orient beat Sutton Utd 4 v 1 today and are 6th in League Two. Start praying now you don't get anyone better in the FA Cup. In other news: Mark Goldbridge hasn't the first clue about how any Man Utd players train during the week.
Ole is embarrassing himself. He should just leave. I doubt he will ever get a coaching job if he doesn't show himself the door.  And we don't want Rodgers
I bet they still don't sack him , I am actually sick of this now
Saving Private Ryan with Chicken - HAHAHA! I am dying mate....
Love this keep it up lads
Van de beek tried to save  Ole career 😂
Ole has done something no other coach has ever accomplished. He united the fans of all other teams 😂
Excuses for Trashford
There needs to be a change this can’t go on , if we carry on we’re going to be far away from top 4
Just laughing at the clowns who have been saying donny is not good enough
United is like my future: no succes.
Would you like me to start the car and bring Rodgers up, your welcome to him 🦊
High fiving Maguire after he gets sent off tells you everything about this manager disgraceful
The writing was on the wall  since the defeat to young boys sadly!!!
Sack them all
Ahahahahaha i really laughing here. You guys killed Jose and said Ole is at d wheel, progress under Ole, 😂😂😂😂 keep him don’t complain!
The best apology is for Ole to resign and the lazy players sold.
And the peppering  continues.
hahahahahahaha
ronaldo was going to win you's the league and you couldn't beat relegation favourites Watford 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 good luck getting a result against Chelsea .. you 🤡 .. shambles utd 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Army of chickens hahahahah, sounds like a chapter in zoo book quran
OLE looked fresh, great move by the club to give him a Caribbean holiday with mask on…. Anyway think that the jab could of cause serious ' damaged to ole’s brain?
"Its not funny' says Goldbridge - it's bloody hilarious!!
He's A prat if he does and a prat if he  doesn't
We went in like wounded Animals
With the way this club moves i would not be suprised to see solskjaer managing us for villareal
Zidane doesn’t speak English right
The glazers are solely to blame
The blind and deaf couldn't act fast enough.
Bless Mark goldbridge  Never give up.
DvB is man of the match in possibly wallys🤡 last game, the irony😀
This is crazy, this is one of the most expensive squads ever assembled. The players are totally to blame. As Keane said this bunch will throw Ole under the bus like they did Jose. Get rid of these ‘superstars’ and build a squad of real players who want to work. There are no prima donnas at Chelsea, City or Liverpool.
I would play shoretire,amad,mejbri and they would win that game.guys it's not about OLE,the players are to blame
Old mate who are the international super stars ! ???? 😂😂😂😂😂
These players dont want to play  for ole
GOT A JOKE FOR YA ALL.... . . .   .   . . . . . HARRY MAGUIRE 🤗
OGS time is up simple as that.................
Players threw OLE under the bus.I would play a young team.Amad and the rest
Dunno who was worse today take your pick lindeloof wan bissaka maguire Shaw matic mctominay rashford shanco bruno ronaldo
Mark goldbridge   You Said yesterday Manchester United  Will win  what happens today🖐
Keep Ole!!! It’s funny for everyone else!!
Ole IN
Ole in
Ralf Rangnick. The godfather of gegenpressing. Roger Schmidt, Tuchel, Ralph Hasenhüttl, and Klopp have cited their main coaching influence is Ralf Rangnick. It would be dream to have him at Man United.
At this point it would be stupid if they don’t sack ole
What was the point of nine days holiday should have sack him before
I feel like I wasted over a decade lol
At this moment in time, I’d rather old Trafford’s janitor taking over to get rid of Ole
Today was embarrassing. It’s been embarrassing for a while, but today, today was embarrassing from top to bottom. How does a club the size of ours let this happen?
Pogba said this during Leicester game and Ole benched him the next game. "we don't know what exactly are we playing"
MUFC must triage this patient. Get rid of Ole NOW!
We needed this... 0le the legend..
🤦🏾‍♂️these people and players have NO Respect for our history an club and Brand please united stand talk to your contacts we have to take that Captains badge off you know who he has to earn it and 💯 I used tobe proud to say we are different to others and we are a pedigree that produces players and gentlemen now we jus looking like the rest when we was an are/should be the Best even now instead todo the right thing all they’re doing is planning how to lie or what to do to appease us the Fans 🤬
willenhall red says  ' YOU KNOW YOU HAVE HIT ROCK BOTTOM WHEN WATFORD FANS SING " OLE'S AT THE WHEEL
Let him stay until end of the season.
Ole has to be given more time
I would rather have ralf than zidane 🤔
Keep oli at the wheel. 😀
Due a run?
So easy to sit behind your screen and abuse people - I am still wondering if you have the balls to do it face to face….. prat
Erik Ten Hag loading...
Surely playing football must come naturally to the team! So I don’t understand why they don’t just fuk the tactics off and play how the fuk they want!!!!
Ole at The wheel. Sign him for The next 10 years. YES YES YES
Ole has won the champions league for the club so deserves respect. He is a club legend.
Ole needs time, he is still building. United have turned a corner with ole.
Roadkill FC... GLAZERS OUT!
Donny proves that ole is killing the team off of his own ego. That’s not a club legend, he looses that status if he prioritizes his ego over our success
Time to go again 😂
Loved it
What you guys need to realize is that this channel is apart of the destruction of MUFC, clearly being paid by the Club AKA BANKERS to spin their own people…I see how disgusted you are with yourself Mark it shows bad, but I hope you know you’re bringing us with you into your filthy gutter.
willenhall red says ' ANOTHER EMBARRASSMENT ' ANOTHER CAPITULATION ' ANOTHER OGS DISASTER CLASS '
that result along with the performance he has to go major rebuild
We had a whole international break for us to sign a manager, get his coaches in and start practicing his tactics
Victim United fc
Bring in meulesteen to end of the season.
Sorry Orient actually won 4-1 today Mark, so don't drop us to Uniteds level
Always said united aren't a proper club, Liverpool is a proper club, 8 points above relegation 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You should have got conte in
Ole obviously doesn't love the club .
How ironic it would be if he gets the sack and the last person to score for him is Donny 🤣🤣🤣
Seeing Maguire been set off has to be the only positive , no more obsession
Sack him before we play arsenal. That's one game I wouldn't want to lose
4:24 Donny is the solution? Really? Loool
I’m emotionally divesting from this team, the players have given up, this is ridiculous
Ole at the wheel at the wheel ole,s at the wheel 🎼🎼🎼🎼🤣🤣🤣🤣
What you are seeing now is the reason why you sack the manager immediately once you realize he is not the right guy, and there were other managers available. The English media stood by him, the players never forsook him publicly, and the fans waited till the end of time to simply say "Ole out". It was clear years ago. When you waste time, and don't use discernment, you suffer in the end. It's well deserved.
Ole outers warned this would happen but no one would listen because people couldn't see pass 99
There will be an emergency meeting at 7 PM between the other 19 PL clubs to try to save Oles job 😁
Slabhead sent off and utd are now playing with 9 men as Ronaldo is about as much use to the team as chocolate teapot. Any manager worth is salt would have subbed Ronaldo and played an attacking midfielder in his stead. A team full of over priced and over hyped players who are not as good as they have been told they are. It doesn't matter who takes over they will be trying to make a silk purse out of a sows ear. The team needs cleaning out of the dross and start with Ronaldo and Mcguire.
I actually don't think Ole will go
For those that know and remember,  Watford where a bogey team for us .This was before Fergie took over , PROOF we where a mediocre team before him .So STOP saying ' we are Man Utd ' , because. ........Football changes,  managers change. THIS IS FOOTBALL
I wish I hadn’t watched Oles post press interview, how he seems to think we played well in the second half is a mystery to me, ole needs to go and drop that ring in the fires of mount doom along with himself because it’s now destroying the club as he shrivels into the form of Smeagol more and more as the days go by.
All I can say that was embarrassing and pathetic OLE your time is up and clueless
Ole is at the Exhaust
Man, to be fair, Ole is absolutely ruining his legacy isn't he? This is just sad.
ole out .out .out ole
I love Ole! ♥️
Am really crying deep down  Ooh United
They definitely played like wounded animals.
Ok so ronaldo gets a 5... would appreciate a little less bia on the whole ronaldo thing. He missed tons of shots.
”nearly called it the PSG league, it basically is”😂😂
Ole in!
Done by dilly dong. PAIN.
You jammy bugger Mark, (is it not pc to say that?) getting a text from Incey....Legend, a real midfield legend.
I just hope we don’t lose donny cuz of ole
Get him and the staff out before we lose good players
Reactive Gonner Solskjaer.... 🤔🤣🤣🤣Hope he goes by tonight. Pack your bags mate.
Refuse to watch another game with Ole in charge. End of.
Manchester United is just in shambles absolute joke I just don't know anymore I feel so sad. United used to be way to escape n live a fantasy even if it's just for 90mins now every 90 minutes is affecting our mental health
Man utd are in a crisis😭😭 karma🤡
Ok, coach needs to go, but you do need a coach against  Watford
Ole in one last game then sack him plss
What are you talking about! Bring a manager in panic? Better thing would be to sack Ole and keep carrick or anyone as interim and have a week or two to get the right manager! Brendam Rodgers?WTF
There is only one: Ed Woodward lol
I knew we were gonna loose when mark said he thinks we are going to win watford 😭😭
I love MUFC so much that of present I am getting sick
Just like fumbling around with Klopp they let Conte go too no one to replace Ole now
If this is Ole’s last game as Man U manager how poetic is it that Donny scores in his last game
I feel sorry for De gea, In every match, he is tired of collecting balls from his own net.
We are out of the Race Premiere league and the worse to come @ Champion league
Is anybody surprised we lost? I always want us to win but what I or you want won’t change Ole is a crap manager. More protests and we need to get this ownership out. Their judgement of everything top to bottom in the club is abysmal.
Sack the board themselves and hire the likes of van der sar,Sir Alex Ferguson, Cantona, Scholes,evra,ferdinand, vidic,Schmeichel, Roy Keane put them in the board they will do wonders instead of the actual board who are incompetent and  brainless
THE PROBLEM HERE THE GLAZER AND WOODWARD @ MUTD
Mark you said we are going to villarreal on Monday.. you mean Tuesday
Donny proves how little Ollie knows about players
Man U has given ole more chances then my ex girlfriend has given me 😂😂🤣🤣
Please say something to blame Jose.  I would be happier and sad at the same time. Jose was hated because he spoke the truth. That old fox Ferguson still runs the club and this time to the ground
A former Liverpool manager who's currently struggling at Leicester is a bad move not quite as banterous as keeping Oli but banter club material non the less
Square wheels on the wagon,
3:00 LoL thanks for cheering me up mark !
Although ole was a legend in playing days he is not manager material let him go ,sack him now
Ole innnnn what a manager 🤩🤩🤩🤩
I love it how everyone is saying that donny is really good when before this game almost half of those people said that donny isn't good lol
Joking aside, why not give Steve Bruce the job until April?
If VDB doesn’t play in spite of good form and training sessions , maybe OGS has something personal against him, but he should be guided first of all by the team interests and put aside personal matters.
Totally disgusted
If Ole really cares about the club, he should hand in his resignation.
Ole is going no where. Give him sometimes, at least 10 years contract.
emergency board meeting as of now  going on
Donny is the man of the match today, he played better than everyone on the pitch
Van de beek was the best player on the pitch the passes he made to Ronaldo were brilliant if he started from the start I don't think we would of lost or maybe of got a draw ole has to go tonight.
De Gea says "we don´t know what to do with the ball".  Well that says it all right there!
Ferguson is also to  blame for what is happening to United for choosing Moyes instead of Mourinho
Ole is a cheat option. Glazernomics.
There’s an elephant in the room at Utd - it’s Christiano Ronaldo. Very conspicuous by his silence. Utds cash cow on £500 grand a week. Never had to play for a team in the trenches and is clearly not cut out for this situation. He’s nailed on for a starting place and was never Ole’s signing. He will always score goals with the right balls coming in to him but will he be up for a fight? He’s been a terrible idea for the club.
9 ‘prat’s' in less than a minute 😂😂
I was predicting 5-3 to Watford. Man that result would've been a dream compared to 4-1 hahaha
They player's rating for this evening should not go above 5 points please
I agree with you. Fire the whole bunch! Start again.
Forget waiting for the board to sack him, Ole should show some class , some dignity and self respect by immediately stepping down. Whatever remains of the legendary status he once had is now gone, obliterated by his poor and mediocre management of this club. It is obvious to everyone, it should be evident to him and the longer he hangs on to the job the more of a fool and the court jester he looks to the football world who is already having a good laugh at him.
Reactive gunnar Solskjaer, so he glows in the dark now?
Well I think even if Olè gets the sack Chelsea will still manage to come with a win because of the fresh manager change so....Up with the Blues!!!💙
Ole in
Should Moyes be given another go?
-19 points in 12 games  26 game left how many more points will united lose this season ? get youre guesses in i think they lose 42 more points all season lol
Just been confirmed on sky sports that Manchester United have called a emergency board meeting for 7pm tonight to discuss oles dismissal along with his compensation payout..
I can’t be ars getting mad I just laugh
Following from Cameroo
I love how they came out and backed Ole just a few days ago 😂 He’s going nowhere, Woodward and the Glazers don’t care
Wake up fans. ..we know about Ollie. GLAZERS 🐷🤡🤡💩 OUT OUT OUT OUT. Or our club is finished.
Before getting sent off Maguire was playing like prime Baresi and he was sent off prematurely. He been awful all year but he was the best player out there. It would have been 5-0 in the first half without him. Got to give the man credit. He was one of the few that looked like he cared
The top 6 shredded their history with the European super league, man utd arsenal spurs in a race for 4th and barca with worse financial management than brentFord.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær: "Football is easy if you've got good players! They are a great bunch of players and their quality is unbelievable."
I mean how bad do you want Man Utd to get? They're literally playing at relegation level! Norwich have played better than this
ollys staying at the wheel, the glazers love him
Maybe he is not the best player ever lived
It's over for ole now, surely this has to be the last straw. Losing 1-4 to a team that just came up last season, wtf!!
This united teams got so much potential, even in a 4-3-3 its got tons of aggressive potential with ronaldo cavani and greenwood up top. All the pace is there just the tactics are non existant. You can't keep  changing the system up like they are football just doesn't work that way.
Bruno, Mctominay were soooo baddddd!!!!!!!! Ronaldo tried so muchhhh but he atleast assisted donny..
I don’t ever want to see Maguire in a United shirt again, pathetic player and captain
I hope that Ole stays 4 - 1 more season.
Mark's  totally right. This was the worst result Man U have had in many a year.  It undeniable to be frank
Ole’s at the wheel, at the wheel, ole’s at the wheel.
The players out!!!!!!!!!!
Wounded animals he said  Went on holiday right after  Now then...
Ole > Nuno
Pathetic.. please get rid of this guy. He's done the best he can. We need someone else to take us beyond top 4
Olé in
Sad day for the other PL teams
Chelsea is going to bend United over a table with no Vaseline 👏
ask sir alex to step in untill we get a manager
They keep on making this about were bad I head to heads with the top clubs. We've been bad since Newcastle...
Glazers and Ole is ruining Ronaldo's legacy
Olee out zidane innnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Keep him in, this is just a blip in form. Ole's at the wheel 🎶
I wonder why VDB has been benched for all this long. He was the best player on the pitch throughout second half
Garry Neville an his mates will be still backing there buddy 🤔😫
Man U have got no one lined up to take over even during the international break, not even an interim manager because they'd still need a coaching team to train them.
Boss response by maguire to his critics
So your telling me Donny can control. Midfield like a beast, make Sancho look like the 70 mill signing that he is and ole has left him to ROT?
Absolute disgrace, against watford and get dominated, not a chance to win league title with  ole
GET THE AJAX MANAGER
Surely he’s gone   It’s over now. You don’t survive this and stay in he NEEDS to go
He couldn't lead a dog. 🤣😂🤣👏🏾
as Mark says a few times, Woodward not sacking Ole after Liverpool until today is indeed VERY strange.. keeping him is definitely not football related, there must be something sinister going on...
Should have kept Jose or moyes
The problem is ▪▪▪》 Ole is a mediocre inexperienced coach and unfortunately has no honor. He should have resigned after Liverpool's match no matter what. Sorry but it is the truth. If he resigned he would have pushed the administration to the corner. So what if the Glazers or Woodward are in charge  , he should have kept his honour and the love of the fans if he resigned.  Good luck
Are you not yet tired of singing this song of Ole out for me lam tired
Ronaldos arrival has destroyed this team
If no other manager is available now, bring Giggsy
Could do worse than bring in Big Sam. Might need him if they wait much longer.
please get rid of Ole today!
Olie forever, what a gem.😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Emergency board meeting tonight.
The moment wasn’t Liverpool and it’s not since Ronaldo joined, Ole was bad appointment from the start. He never had a game plan to win  W big boys. Writing was on the wall at beginning of season. Gary is a disgrace. We have missed Conti opportunity. Its a shambles!!! Donny played great, we need to keep him. This could have all been avoided if someone made the right decision in the summer. Need to appoint a mgr who is a 1st class hands-on coach who only accepts winning.
So glad you beat us!  Conte's at the wheel.... And leave the Orient out of it - lots of us Spurs fans have a soft spot for the O's. Seriously though, I'm no ABU.  Shocking what's happening at your club
Rashford needs to go back to basics and concentrate on football...very poor
Club is rotten to the core
Got the mourinho paddy Power ad in this I could only but laugh 😂
I'm wondering how much u miss Mourinho now 🤔
Its over FOREVER UNITED WILL DREAM OF TOP TEN SOON ITLL BE YER DREAM
BRodgers has already said no to you BTW. He said he wants to stay in Leicester, his job there not done yet.
We go again lads! 😃💪🏽
Ole at the wheel ha ha ha
Bring in Steve Bruce or Mark Huges as care takers and go for a bigger name in the summer
Sancho and Donny continue to show Ole that they need to be in the starting XI.. Ole is a coward Luke Shaw and Rashford should never start..
Ole and Maguire out!
Best result United could have had today, if they do the obvious thing. But will they?
And he’s laughing in the post match interview what a joke of a man...sir Alex would have bombed the stadium and done a massacre after this performance if he were manager
Global laughing stock
Lingard should never play again for disrespecting the club the way he did
No excuse for it but if man United don’t sack ole we might have to personally talk to ole yo resign I mean damn smh
what ! we haven't  been fucked properly as yet, and you want to be rid of sir Alex's protege ? how ungrateful can you get !
Was this the evening that OLE burnt his spirit of 99...
Hahahaha as if Mark brought receipts im deceased
i want some of that ole job security 😂
MANCHESTER United footballl club making arsenals fall from grace lookkint like the galacticos  Man poo
Ole and co gotta go. This is enough. Just brutal.
I see no rational reason why Gunnar loves McTominay so much, he was mediocre at best in the past and has been AWFUL this season, he definitely has no idea what a defensive midfielder should do. Are they having an affair or something?
U Orn’s!
How Mctominy plays ahead of Donny makes me absolutely sick
Ole is the gift that keeps on giving 😂y’all be safe tho
Thought United would win today 😂😂
I was so disgusted when harry threw the captains armband on the ground. He knows that hes not worthy of being the captain.
Ole out please and please ole out ole leave our team alone please leave 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡ole out
Did that idiot Maguire hold his hands up to his ears when he got sent off.....
The board have given Ole more chances than Coleen has given to Wayne Rooney
Ole in, those of you who want him out aren’t real United fans
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na now Ole, give it up Give it up Ole, give it up
Only Ole can make Ronaldo look ordinary
Who next
This is the poorest run club in the premier league  No direction  No ideas Amateur coaching staff  Petulance players Lazy players Poor management  Please bring in hard working modern day players who work hard an press an get rid of these overpaid lazy players
Somebody, anybody is there a football manager out there who can rescue us
Please hire me man united, i will provide anything better than ole and Believe me
Ronaldo and Bruno didn't want to score today,they also want ole out
Watford have NOT been in the relegation places all season and would not have been today if they lost 99-0. Do your research.
It's gonna be fun when they sack Ole and finally fans will realize that the team ain't that good either lol
Highlight Easter Island statues move faster than Harry. Worse United Captain ever
Oleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees at the wheel
McTominay just a cheerleader😆😆😆 brilliant
His plastic smile invokes furious anger Yes Chelsea than the Arse five str8 defeats
ole cannot sack himself but he could have and should have resigned a while ago especially if he wants the best for the club
But why is ole till now still in our club
A relegation team beat another relegation team
You have a better squad than last season And you guys are 6 points behind last season HOW, JUST HOW
Ole must just resign, if United dont sack him. United is very incompetent, its unbelievable
I hope Ole gets till the end of the season at least its only right he's a legend for united
Mark please to manchester just like last time you did with Mourinho.
Rock bottom
Solskjaer is totally clueless. In the world according to Ole, Maguire is a ''true example of a Man United player''. Anyone can see Maguire is an utter donkey.  Under Ole Man United are officially a pathetic shambles and THE laughing stock of the Prem.
It's reached a point now where I am beyond caring as its clear the club and players don't give a toss its become a laughing stock
Ole will not be SACK until January.. 👍
Maguire is the most overrated defender, no leader, no positioning, he doesn’t have a football brain and his only picked because he plays international, just because you play for your country doesn’t make you a top player.
You Horns! COME ON! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Why is woodward still there? Thought he went ages ago? Is old Trafford just being haunted by ghosts of Christmas past destroying everything? Think the wounded animals have had their legs amputated
As expected Mark. Ur the only one who believes that we have better players. Ur deluded Mark.
I thought Woodward was going
To be fair, they did lose to a Premier League Champion manager.
Bravoo ole mctominay mcguire u did it again from champion to relegation
Been saying it for months. The best thing for us at this point is to continue to lose games until they fire this coach and friends.
Very Good. Keep him till we are relegated. I am waiting for us to be  relegated.
Donny and sancho looked really good
MANURE UNITED 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You have to give ole time like arteta
Very Good. Keep him till we are relegated. I am waiting for us to be  relegated.
PSG league 😂😂😂
The Goldbridge jinx did it!!!!!
So called experts  ..ole is so fuckin cocky and he's useless... these so called experts  are the reason he's still in a job
Clapping the away fans and holding his hands up his days are numbered
O g s wanted a reaction,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, keeping the rest of the world happy, keep on driving the bus, 😂🤣😂🤣
Loool Mark so viciously Ole out...you love to see it.
4 goals from 16th place Watford he has to go
If the board decide to keep Ole after this they seriously need to go or sell the club. If they don't sack him then Ole should resign if he has any shame or love for united
OGS is safe until the end of the season. Irrespective of results.
united in a very, very good performance according to an Ole..😱...   I'm tired of seeing this team... no strategy, no good defense, did you see that too???  Together with Ole, United will jump out of the Premier League!!!
Hollywood has Lord Cage Bollywood has Lord Bobby Football has Lord Bendner Football Ultimate Manager has Lord Ole
Ole at the wheels 😊; Mourinho is playing boring football? right ?
Lmao 'Saving private ryan with chickens'....lol this has been saving private ole...the flim has to end now
Donny really played well today him and sancho were on fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
The board are actually considering to Sack Ole now.
We lost again! Not a surprise I feel nothing. Sad seeing us ruin the clubs reputation week in week out. Sad very sad.
Very true when you say 4 points in 21, gets you the sack at most clubs, abroad also. Spot on 👍🏾
Man Utd official Tweeter: "Defeat At Vicarage Road" As if it was our usual news.
GM Chevrolet is so happy now and teamviewer is like eating a fly💀
Ole instructed his defenders and midfielders to play within their half ground only.They never passed ball to the box of their opponent.
Not being funny but let's face it Hartford are a class above man u
Mark overheard you,  when you said that we will probably win Watford yesterday and I laughed because you probably don’t know how bad we are this season. I hope this will tells  you that no game is guaranteed as long as Ole  is still in charge of this club.   He is doing to us what he did in Cardiff
Imagine CR7 in championship
So many people kept backing this PE teacher, why? You can smell garbage a mile away you don't need to stand next to it.
Ole needs time Klopp took him 5 years until he won the league
And Martial was saying during the interview when he had extended his contract « …I hope to win the UCL… »
United are turning into the Ashley era Newcastle United
Anybody got a spare ticket for the public execution against Chelsea
Leave ole alone. He needs more time. Hopefully 5 years
Stoke in ur head rent free mate and in better form than u lot
HE COULDNT LEAD A DOG😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
4 points from 21, they only got one win and a draw in TWENTY-ONE games
Ole manage and ruin the Bucaneers see if Glazers would like that
Forget Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow. Welcome to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Comedy Roadshow.
A bit insulting to Leyton Orient , that Mark.
De gea  7 lol
Woodward is the problem. He's the one who makes these decisions and he isn't making it for his personal gain.
How far have we fallen ,
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Goldbridge has got nothing left to say ... nobody wants to manage Manchester United,  not even ole .
At this moment, I only concern on Zidane’s English learning progress
Bruno will be ignored but he is no captain. Whenever we need leaders he vanished. Villarreal, City, Liv, today  Vs almost every top 6 side.   But people say give him the armband
The players no longer care , the manager has to go and he can take a couple of these players with him , Maguire an 80 million defender ? Robbery of the century .
I’m sick and tired of this situation  We should get the Glazers out of this club
Watch United legends putting it on the players.
Hahah
Ronaldo knew that before signing. The whole team is bad, and the manager is a joke. Being humiliated match after match is what Ronaldo can expect in his career now
Man U players are good, they just need strategies and tactics and also sack ole.
I predicted Watford 2-1 MU. I was correct until Maguire was sent off!!!
Didn't think it could get any worse, But not surprised,  Woodward's selection off managers has ruined this club, Now he needs to at least show some balls and sack the lot.
The players are not good enough
Get slaughtered again and again and again.
Muckchester Utd 💩🤡
Ole in 10 more years to his contract please
Look at de gea how did bruno play mark
Lol he's had this same reaction for the last three games. And Ole has survived. Long may this continue. 😜
Ronaldo out!!!!
I not sad,not angry and not even disappointed. I am just numb to United. United just doesn't feel the same anymore. His gotta go.
Ole only plays Scott just to impress Fergie
We buy players to let them rot, donny, sancho, varane, telles and he says they aren’t ready to play lol. I would 100% play donny over pogba any day, pogba doesn’t want to be at the club, Maguire should take Phil Jones place atleast Phil Jones played for the badge
i dont understand the glazers. if the club doesnt do well, it's gonna hurt their pockets ultimately. everyone is pissed. who's in the mood to buy shirts anyway. then losing $ revenue from champions league. what are they thinking.
Ole must be sack now
You ornnssss 🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
4 points from 21 isn’t relegation form. It is relegatED form. Ole is out at sea without a paddle. De Beek played brilliantly but will get benched. Sancho did OK but was subbed,  the captain was terrible and got sent off. It’s quite the most unbelievable situation. There’s isn’t another club in the world who would keep such incompetence beyond their station.
With Chelsea & Arsenal next & lower teams now performing, we are in relegation form & could be in or near that zone very soon unless drastic action is taken immediately
Soksjaer is useless
After that performance by DVB, its mind boggling that Ole keeps on playing McFred week in week out 🤷
I'm a watford tan and I know we are going to be in a relegation battle but I 5hought with our pace we could get something today and can't remember ever thinking that on a fixture against man u  ,agree you need get rid ole
Thought United were going to win the league with the ‘goat’😂
Where are the Ole fans at?
We certainly came out like wounded animals today... Fatally wounded animals
THE FACT DONNY SHOWED HE’S ONE OF OUR BEST PLAYERS PROVES HOW USELESS OLE IS. ALL HIGHLIGHTED TODAY. HOW THE HELL HAS ALL THESE BAD FORM PLAYERS BEEN PICKED ABOVE DONNY FOR PAST WEEKS/MONTHS.
I love these results if he won he was going to stay well done player you heard our prayers
It's board fault all this bloody mess
Seriously 4-1 hammering off Watford that’s got to be the nail in the coffin ⚰️
Just listen to David's comments what a disgrace, "don't blame the manager"
Raneiri is better Manger then Ole, well every manager in the league..
We need to think about qualification for next years Champions league … the longer we go on with OGS this won’t happen.
Ole Goner Solskjær
Mark are you Ole in or Out ? stop sitting on the fence
I'm not going to forget Ole smiling and giggling after the Everton result. He should have went then imo I don't feel sorry for him because he is too nonchalant in his approach to management.
Do not know who they could bring in now, but the bleeding must stop. Sack Ole and while there at it overhaul the whole board. we need a rebuild starting at the top. Get a technical director of football to run the show.
Ole signing a  new contract  O NO HELP  sad for Manchester United  , ole should be a man and walk away thumbs up if you agree 🕊🇬🇧
If you do bets I feel robbed not betting against united and I support them
Penaldooooo 😂😂😂
Donny van de beek deserves better manager and United needs new Manager ASAP
Alex Ferguson is supporting Ole! Alex out !
I want oles reaction after that donny masterclass
😆😆😆…deserve everything you’re getting. Been a club who’s fans have lauded over other teams for so long…now you’re a nothing club. Long may that continue…and long may Ole be at the wheel. That banner…will come back to haunt you.
Who are they going to bring in at this stage of the season,if they sack him? What a shambles! No structure,no planning.🙄
Maybe still bloody Jose is guilty for today's defeat.
The day Ole gets the sack
Yes Mark
RANGNICK???? WHY IS THIS GUY NOT IN THE MIX? AT LEAST TIL THE END OF THE SEASON NO?? FAAAAAACK
I just puked in my mouth. Humbled by Watford fuckin Watford with arguably greatest player ever in your side. It's beyond sackable now.
We miss on conte
Ole's at the wheel. Great to see. Extend his contract by another decade. Love the Glazers.
A Salute to Ranieri though
Hope they keep ole on 🤣🤣🤣
Lets start again !
Ole sacking not possible without Woodward sacking.
A glorious day
Please leave man 😭😭
I actually feel sick
Ole is turning united into fcking burnley
Ollie's at the wheel
Ole doesn`t know what system to play because he doesn`t have one. He is totally tactless. The team are just as tactless like headless chickens. What a mess.
Ole needs to buy top cdm in January and play v beek with new cdm in a 4-5-1 formation with Fernandez behind the no.9
Me in FM as Manager > Ole As manager..
Cristiano please leave united
If we continue this way we will get relegated to 2nd division, a real football club will immediately sack this man Ole!
Ole at the wheel 😂
I wonder how this shill Gary Neville will spin this one.
Ronaldo thinks he's too famous to run around. Bruno is braindead without the ball. Shaw looks bored. Maguire lost his bottle after having a fight in Greece. McTominay looks like Peter Crouch trying to play in midfield.
The Club is making a joker of a club legend, by not sacking him. Perhaps they want Ole to walk away so they don't have to pay him compensation.
👉💩👈  Maguire's actions and today's performance has turned Ole's Man Utd into the above meme.
We can have many names right now. Bounce Back FC, Bottlers United FC, Shambles FC, Joke United FC, Depressed United FC.
Ole glazers show enjoy relegation, McGuire class captain..lol..worst united season in club history..
Mark 'no disrespect to Watford'.  Then goes on to disrespect Watford, by stating they will be in a relegation battle'.  And what is 4 points out of a potential 24....... relegation form....
ChrisMD and Adam lallana > Mcfred
Lets look at the positive,atleast Ronaldo won't be playing in the Europa league next season , because United won't even be in Europe next season.
If I see another “we go again” tweet I SWEAR lmao
Looks like man United still traumatize by young boy kit colors
Can't wait Roy Keane to say that DVB is an average player. Did you see Roy what the hell of class offered DVB in 45 minutes and did more than McFred have been doing these last two years?
😂😂😂😂 Ole in
Ole just needs time boys
So was it smart to fire Mourinho? i doubt it!
The problem Glazer have if he fires Ole, is who will replace him? Zidane? He can´t even speak english, and there are romours that his wife does not want to go to Manchester? So who do you pick to replace Ole?
Ole's at the wheel, at the wheel, loving it don't sack ole
This could actually turn out to be a really good day for us United fans
Ole innnnnnn
United will come out as a dead I mean wounded animal against Villarreal
David dea looked like he had been crying in his post match interview.
WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN TO US 😭
More nonsense from the guy who said Fred was a brilliant signing!
Fucking disgraceful
The players just dont care.
Since we lost 0-5 to Liverpool I have stopped paying for matches on sky
Why the hate on Ole always? Such a good manager and overhated imo
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's people who say "I lOvE oLe bUt hE mUsT gO" who get on my nerves, more so than Ole and that impotent board! What does it have to do with his abysmal results and mannerism? I don't conceive him of being a legend, so stop bringing it up to back your lame excuse!
Ridiculous. Get rid of the whole team
ole out
He got Cardiff Relegated what did you think was gonna happen???
OLE OUT
