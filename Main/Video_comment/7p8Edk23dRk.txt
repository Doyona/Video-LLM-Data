It has been 5 years and until this day, in almost 34 years of life, this was the most memorable fight I've ever had in a video game and Alatreon is a close second. How I loved this game, my first MH, later I also played Freedom Unit, MH2, Rise and Wilds and no one comes even close to base World or Iceborne.
Easily still one of the hardest things ive ever fought, he was truly an unforgettable fight and i cant wait to see what they do with him in the dlc of wilds
The hunter becomes the hunted (quite literally because of the armor)
Almost 5 years later and this still gives me chills
Finally beat this horror to this day as a MHFU veteran never again gonna come back after this 😂
If Savage Deviljho and White Fatalis aren’t in the Monster Hunter Wilds DLC, then this game wouldn’t truly be wild.
No me imagino como fue la reacción de todos al ver esto
Newbies: Damn new strong monster Veterans: ... *Flashback in Freedom Unite including the variants* Hehe I'm in danger🙂
CURSE YOU!!!
Wait... So bosses have separate trailers?
I still fail...it's been 3 years of hunting fatalis and alatreon. I feel like giving up😢
I had to start all over from the beginning due to my data messing up.  For vets out there, how much trouble am I in for?
Friendly reminder to newbies, if the boss theme has an opera... you are screwed :D
3 years has passed and I still have goosebumps every time I watch this... But still nothing tops the feeling the first time you watch this trailer ever both new and fivers trembled before him at least once  and finally slayed him ...
3 years and still not at 1 million views   Crazy
most successful update ever
So basically........ Capcom just went "Fuck it, here's Alduin, First-born of Akatosh, The World Eater Wyrm. Good luck chucklefucks" and the left everyone to scream and die
Dear new ppl your fucked    Sincerely a MH turtle veteran
bro who designs these  oneshot mechanics? Played perfectly for fifteen minutes straight? nah bro get oneshot. makes a fun boss unfun
It's incredible to think 3 years have passed. World/Ib was an incredible journey i wish i could've experienced with actual friends. Such an amazing game
Revisit this trailer after see what sunbreak has to offer in their final update. Damn man We need monster hunter world 2
its been 2 years and this things still kicks some azz
Here before dying see a malzeno variant  be the final TU of sunbreak, the equivalent of this legend as a final boss 😂
this theme sounds like fighting god.
Wow, Fatalis in World is my living nightmare, I have yet to beat it.  And naturally, the update was released on the nightmarish time of the year.  Update, I finally beat it!!!
“Did you think I did not know this day would come? That a pack of canting dogs would come crawling back to the kingdom? The king of the castle is dead - I took his throne! I ate his people like odogaron among jagras! I kill where I wish, when I wish! My armor is iron! No blade can pierce me!”
World players are lucky they didn't add white and crimson fatalis. Crimson fatalis has more firepower and sleeps on lava casually. White fatalis is just raw dragon element lightning also it was the first monster to have a no, no cart for you attack even before world.
Hey remember when title updates where hype like this? A thing MH Rise is SEVERELY lacking, like honestly who gives a shit about "risen Elder Dragons"
There’s only 2 things that can even top this trailer and the goosebumps and terror it brings. Both are other Fatalis.
Sincerely one of the most nostalgic and best fights of MHW.
Out of the many things I love about the monster hunter series, the introduction of English voice acting is definitely not one of them lmao
*Ah yes, unbeatable dragon.*
I once saw a comment on Reddit that Fatalis is so hard that it took some of the best speedrunners of the game 7-8 hours to defeat him. I don't remember the source but holy hell, Fatalis knocked the best of the best players to their knees, and this is just the weakest Fatalis out of the trio.
remember that he scared lao shan lung who's is like 50x bigger than him which is why he was running away to the fortress in 1st gen
Still get Goosebumps from this trailer. It's that good! Took my friend and I over 2 weeks to beat this bastard.
Still one of the best things to have ever happened in all of monster hunter if not the best
One year later and when Fatalis roars I still click on the thumbs up
40 tries, 2 WINS....   I HATE THIS THING!
The ones outmatched are the ones who failed doing this mission :O  It's like the game knew people would fail a lot here
Fresh from Freedom Unite.
Can't believe it's been a year now.
This is by far the greatest dragon fight in gaming. Capcom dethroned Grigori themselves.
Its already been one year since the last iceborne developer diary , FeelsStrongMan
There couldn’t have been a better conclusion to the journey that was Iceborne
Best I got was phase 2 in 15 minutes
What a classic
Nergigante Said I can't eat this
Just beat this guy in Monster Hunter Stories 2 at the end of the post game Dungeon.   Im glad i saved my really good healing items haha.
Everytime I watch this trailer, I still get amazing by Capcom.
*After the Alatreon update* World Players: "Maybe after this, we'll get Safi's final form!"  *Fatalis gets announced* MH Veterans or just plain people who took the time to know the lore: "Oh boy!...it's WORSE"
You know you are a god damn horrifying beast when the only thing you need to scare the absolute pants off somebody is a god damn CHILD SONG.
No matter how many times you watch this, it still gives you goosebumps
Fatalis is coming to shrade   He knows when you are hunting   He knows when your sleeping   He knows when you try to sharp or heal    So just delete the game  FATALIS IS COMIN TO SHRADE   FATALIS IS COMIN TO SHRADE~
When your best armor set is frost fang:
Fuck fatalis
Capcom: “This, is Fatalis.” MH Players: “Dear god...” Capcom: “There’s no more.” MH Players: “ *NO...* “
ok... i shitted myself
Trivia: Fatalis translates as “deadly” in Latin.
I just noticed that there's the Guild's logo behind Fatalis at 0:42
Wildexpertin guckt mir zu vom Spawn mit Fernglas
nice alter zum glück hilft mir auch jeder am spawn
und lass den direkt nach Ödnis wallbang
komm mach den noch unsterblich
ihr habt das ganze spiel damit gefickt amk ya
ich hasse euch
will we get our existence vaporized by the ultimate fatalis again?
Me: well I made it past raging brachy and taser ape, what a fun game, looks like ime done  CAPCOM: actually we added these big scary dragons that completely shit on basically every playstyle. They’re broken, but we’re not gonna admit it. After all we have hordes of Stockholm syndrome ridden fans that will tell people to kill themselves if they say something seems designed stupidly.  Me: WHAT A FUN GAME LOOKS LIKE IM DONE.
Since Dragon's Dogma 2 was leaked it would be awesome if Capcom decided to include the red dragon in Monster Hunter
Alatreon: help pls Fatalis: don't worry little bro ill get back at em for u
only the OGs remember when your weapon used to bounce of him 90% of the time
yeah sure, Fatalis is pretty tough. But have you ever tried delivering a powderstone through the volcano while being chased by Bullfango, Ioprey, ceantaurs, and Melynx, not once but TWICE!?
2020 Hunters: Fatalis is hard Me: He was my armor before, he'll be my armor again!
The music somewhat resembles Sephiroth Music Theme.
give me the white one
Call for help  Run for your lives  And don't forget to  Pray to the skies
Im not surprise if Capcom gonna release White Fatalis next
Beat him a week after his release, and my god he was fun, super difficult, but fun. I’m glad he got the World treatment, this is how Fatalis is supposed to be.
Before Alatreon goes to sleep, he check under his bed for G Rank White Fatalis
I just want my frenemy plesioth back in this game.
How about dire miralis , the boiling black dragon
rush limbaugh
First time I slayed this monster was with a random Chad may the legend of bigboiitoast be passed on for centuries.
When i have burned your land..your kingdom and your people to ashes..then you have my permission to die..Hunter.  Welcome back old friend
My old friend!!!!!😍😍 I will defeat you again!!! Its an honor!!!!
Love that theme brings me back to MHFU on psp so many hours on that game.this was a perfect ending for mhw.
I wish we could see a fight between a final stage of growth jiva vs white fatalis.  Nuke dragon vs destroyer dragon.
Hey, that's pretty good....  Considering it's not from frontier series
History Repeats itself
Alatreon was bad but this thing...... it scares me
I have a Feeling Fatalis can go toe to toe with Cthulhu and win
Hope they add white Fatalis to. ^^
" Smaug has Coming "
As a MH4U Veteran... my old hearth startet rushing and my tired eyes gets the former gaze.   Me: hallo old friends Black, Red, White Fatalis: havent see you in a while.
Imagine how cool a crimson or white fatalis mod would look   (Tbh i think its a matter of when than if for this mod to come out soon)
yesss the only monster that can killl                   MY END GAME LEVEL PALICOES
Too op nerf, no pattern, just a stroke of luck if get him to phase 4.
Pain.
Veterans: *cites the legends of the black dragon on every video* MHW newcomers: These veterans are exaggerating, Fatalis isn't that big of a deal. He is just another elder dragon boss *Fights begin. Dies in the first 40 seconds* MHW player: Oh God! Oh no! Oh shit! *+14 hours later* player: I'm almost thereeeee.... *time runs out* player: fuuuuuuu!!!
Everyone:hyped at fatalis Me who just got the game and it’s stuck at barioth:•___•
Who is watching this after they have fought fatalis?
And so we stand....ready....armed....and patient We know that this will be an end....for us....or for him To all new hunters out there....god speed and good luck It has been an honor
Guys, there's dude here that "He wants the Original Theme of Monster Hunter, when the Fatalis is about to die." is freaking DONE, YUP WHEN THE FATALIS IS ABOUT TO DIE THE THEME OPENS.
Everyone: OH Boi, Fatalis is back. This fight is gonna be good as all hell Reality: Fatalis: Well hello children, My name is Speedy Gonzales. You want to know why? It's because I'm FAST
Palicoes Carting Business Industry: "It's inevitably free real estate and high in Stonks."
so he is here
Just wait until we get White Fatalis, big daddy makes this Fatalis look like an infant lizard with wings.
3 HOURS I can't wait.
h o t f i s h
Its today!!
Phone rings Hunters: hello. Phone: *pure silence* Hunters: are you there? Fatalis: 1 day. Hunters: *surprised pikachu face*
Y'all better fight this thing and live so I can see you in Rise.
dude .. i praise the hunter from the trailer .  Everyone geared up, even the cadet with Kushala armor but the hunter with regular hunter gear
*Phone rangs* Hunter: yes? Fatalis: *7 hours*
Tfw you get here at 666K views  The Devil comes tomorrow...
yeah sure hes strong but give it a couple weeks after hes released and your gonna see people solo speed running him, wont be such a scare for long
The Fatalis palico equipment is SMOOTH
Today its going down
9 years ago I fought him. I never beat him.
I feel like the real ending is your character never comes back after beating him, the rest is a dream state after becoming Fatalis.
Honestly I was hoping his "judgement" attack would have been a call back to older Fatalis fights... specifically White Fatalis being abled to disintegrate a player with lighting and end a hunt instantly no matter how many faints you had left.
24 hours... the boys turn to men
Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives   Fatalis to all veterans
It was an honor to fight alongside all of you my fellow hunters, may the sapphire star guide us to victory
I CANT KILL ALATREON YET
i am curious to what happened to the Excitable A-lister.. did he die after taking a direct hit from fatalis ?
FAAAAATAAAAALIIIIIIIIISSS
I will buy Iceborne only for that !! So fucking gooooddddd!!
I hope fatalis eats the handler
Team DarkSide: "FINALLY... A WORTHY OPPONENT... (FOR NOW)"
It really ends here..
Would be nice to see White Fatalis that turns you to atoms in IceBorne :D
0:21 that person wearing HR armor?
So no Congalala?
3 Days, Death Shall Arrive, It’s Been A Pleasure? Good Luck To You All.
Am I the only one who's extremely worried this is just gonna be another dps-check with no replay value? (Cough cough Alatreon)
Guys, let’s get this to 666,666 views by October 1st.  It’s the only appropriate number for the evilest monster of them all...
I never got into the past MH games but loved this game since it released on steam... [backstory] I remember beating the first part of MHW and thinking (I remember the horror stories my friends use to tell me about deviljho, hopefully I get to see him) *moments after completing and unlocking high rank "A deviljho has been spotted" . . . O_O  (the stories are true) I then heard stories about Alatreon AND TO THIS DAY I CANT BEAT HIM BECAUSE IM A HBG USER but none of that compares to the things ive heard about Fatalis.... I COULDNT EVEN BEAT THE FIRST BLACK DRAGON AND NOW YOUR BRINGING GOD INTO THIS...
Fatalis: What is a King to a God? Me, unbeknownst of what’s to come: What is a God to a Non-Believer?
God, the respect given when they say "its not a monster, but history." with that epic opening vocals is so fucking good. He will live up to his title im sure. For everyones sake, good luck brothers, for this may be... our last hunt!
Imagine all of the "Fatalis" games are being controlled by another player, and his objective is to drop your "Z" to "0".
Who's gonna win? AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION THAT HUNTS AND EATS ELDER DRAGONS EVERYDAY?.  or some Half-blood Rajang guy...
Finally managed to beat Alatreon today. NEVER AGAIN! Good thing he was the only Black Dragon in this god damn ga- AH FUCK!!
The Legend itself. Finally a worty opponent!
Where is the gun to shoot myself
0:26  Handler: hang on no way Me: exactly
bruh i think fatalis is my cousin i has been hitting the gym recently but him holy god hes been hitting the drugs holy god someone needs to stop that thing
My old pal
We still doing that thing where double digit ranked hunters can join end game quests? I think they should sit this one out
Gonna need fire resist lvl 3..........
New mechanic: If you fail the dps check, Fatalis just straight-up kills you and you have to make a new hunter.
Players new to World have no idea what they're getting into.
Fatalis, the *one* monster where you *Dont* Hunt it. *IT* hunts you... Forever
I was getting almost done for fatalis and they grounded me. Fuck
Literally everyone: OMG FATALIS???? OW SH1ET TIME TO MAX MY ARMOR!!!!  Me: where did whitey go?
*frantic flailing and screaming*
I had so much trouble with him the last time I fight him
I’m so scared
Sooooooooo excited.
You know the rules it's time to die
Remember that time when your facing white fatalis on g when he hits you with ray gun from the sky you just evaporated. I wish they put that shit back.
Finally someone die!!
So two black dragons
We’re all gonna die
Come back my older enemy since 2004 un the first mh
Hell yeah, big daddy is coming home
I hope he's OP as the original... By that I mean when he used to 1 shot everyone
jesus finally...
0:43 I heard fatalis
I already took down Safi’Jiiva, this dragon shouldn’t be a threat.         Right?
All i want as a reward for this fight is to have serious handler back.
BOIIII
*kingdom of predators starts playing*
Ah yes, the physical form of evil itself... I couldn’t even kill this thing back at MHFU
Gut feeling, xeno>safi>Fatalis... I hope I'm wrong af.
_What's a god to a Hunter?_
Can't wait to see you personally for the first time. I have always been a big fan, but now i will finally be able to show you that
Am master rank 550 ay beat all the monsters
Am not gonna die to fatalis ay have furios rajang armor and ay have earplugs in level 5
It's all GL and Bombs all over again
is this going to be hard? idk im not a veteran i only played the new games
No I’m not sweating that’s just uh rain
When the world is full of wyverns The legend is revived Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched. And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth And melts through iron He boils the rivers And mows down trees He awakens the winds And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction  Call for help Run for your lives And don't forget to Pray to the skies  He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction  Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours  Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours
Remember dark souls
Now this is the true final boss   THE GOD OF ALL MONSTERS  THE BLACK DRAGON OF THE APOCALYPTIC  KILLING HIM ONLY MAKES HIM MORE POWERFUL AND IF HE DOESNT DIE YOU WILL
Newbie hunters(me): confused screaming*
This is just an opinion of mine but what if as a possible power up Fatalis can focused his fire breath into a pinpoint hyper beam just like shin godzilla and Midir? You know since xeno and safi'jifa got this laser and stuff
Newbies : oh, so this is fatalis you guys telling about Vet : yep, and there's more like albino fatalis with red f*cking lightning
Sweet Jesus, fatalis is one hell of an addition
im gonna hide in a corner with my lance guard up and guard 5 and cry for my life yay
Essa é uma expansão gratuita
Just a few days more <3
He is coming next Thursday
He is so damn close
I want the General's armor/clothes.
Why is this not scheduled on the mhw calendar ??? Can someone tell me...
I think the excitable a lister is going to die. The trailer hinted at it, and it’d be a great impactful way to introduce this boy.
one more week to go..
Just a little more than a week away bois! Good luck to all who fight and actually win!
Is fatalis really that dangerous?
*Sad world noises*
Cant stop fapping at this trailer
THERE IT ISSS HOLY FRICKING CRAP DUDE ITS HIM
Now this will be a worthy end of my playtrough.
is this gonna be just as retarded as Alatreon? DPS check, stupid requirements,  instakill nova etc...if he's anything like Alatreon i'm uninstalling the game
who wants a white/crimson fatalis armor? they looked so fucking sick..especally the helmets
Fatalis is the most strong elder dragon he can beat any monsters
snoop dogg fluffy interview
So sad fatalis. I wish i could see fatalis stick out his tounge.
imagine how triggered people would be if we don't actually kill fatalis instead we fight him to a standstill and safi comes outta nowhere to challenge him and gets the kill lol  cause fun fact when it comes to the actual story in mhw the safi siege never happens only the first fight where he flys off is canon its why they mention during alatreon mission that "that red monster lives there" cause we never actually killed him just made him fuck off then avatar the last carter shows up to basically investigate wtf is going on a little bit later so safi is technically still alive and they could just troll us by making safi the new biggest bad and it would be hilarious to me lol
I wish iceborne was free🙁🙁🙁
I hope he isn't a siege monster I want to fight him solo lol
Fatalis basically is the thanos of the monster hunter universe lol
This is it everyone, the final battle, either we succeed to defeat the black dragon king or humanity will burn just as Castle Schrade did so long ago
Commander: Where's my dragonator!?
Fatalis after killing a bunch of hunters Fatalis: wait, who are these team darkside people? Fatalis opens up youtube for a minute Also fatalis:.... Uh oh....
Capcom: *crys* Hunters: What are those? Tears? Fatalis: They’re not for him
Behold....the most dragon
Fatalis confirmed!
I sincerely believe Dragons like Fatalis are not Elder dragons but Arch Dragons
10 days
I'm worried for the Excitable A-Lister. Fatalis was known for destroying an entire civilisation. Someone's dying in this battle.
The god of all monsters is here everyone prepare for there is only two weeks left until Fatalis
Was hoping for valstrax last monster update got fatalist instead.....dissapointed
MHW da best!
Let's Solo Fatalis!
Capcom please add the Crimson and White one,it won't be the same without them
They actually done it....  2020: the end is nigh...
They should make arch tempered alatreon and fatalis be in this update
is time for pain 😥😭
I am going to put one winged angel when the time comes
FATA "I'LL DO IT MYSELF"
"Fatalis will come to the new continent? If so, where in the new continent?" "Come to my house" "I'm sorry"
nergigante : I EAT OTHER ELDER DRAGONS!  fatalis: x doubt
Newbies: Oh a new monster Veterans: (Fatty flashbacks) (Me) Tryhard veterans: Ill have his set and weapon at the end of his first day out
I wonder how many gimmicks they managed to cram into this fight.
i love this will come out as the same day as my 21st birthday so can't wait to battle Fatalis
Lol this has more views than alatreons
im vegan
Did they just kill the ginger?
Evacuate all hunters Engage all defenses And get this hunter a weapon
With fatalis and two other games coming up, it’s great to be alive
WOW!!!! October will be a very busy month for me... Fatalis Grindfest and the new Genshin Impact from Mihoyo entertainment...
The king of all the beast is back
I'm real fuggin worried about the A-Lister for some reason. I hope he's alright.
I need the OST
Monster Hunter Rise anyone?
Dire miralis
Make it avaible rank 100 to avoid the nerf noobies
cant wait for canta solo
So......how much stronger is Fatalis than Alateron?
Let them bring frontier fatalis he actually lived up to the lore
daaaamn, nice!
Tenia f en que pusieran al khezu o shogun ceanataur y shogun hermiaurs y yama tsukami en monster hunter world iceborne pero igual el fatalis también estaba esperando
So Fatalis will be a free update? Are all the other monsters added afterwards also free?
"yup wooden barriers will stop it!"
Fatalis is cool and all but. Wheres my boy chameleos
"Hello Rudy" said Buck.😈
....Time to burn the disc
Fatalis was part of my childhood over 10 years ago - I remember fighting the fatalis with my best friend and my younger brother. We succeeded after hours on end and it remains one of my favorite childhood memories. Can't wait to face it again. Hell, I even got a Fatalis tattoo recently to give proper respect to this monster.
This is pretty badass, especially with the music.
Here's to hoping its the Frontier fatalis. xD
Beginner ib hunters:Are you going to save the world? Veteran ib hunters:Well yes..yes i am😎
In before TDS solo first attempt him
remember lads, it is rumored that it burned the corpses of thousands of fallen hunters into its hide much like armor
Got into MH through and only heard the legends of fatalis. What the hell have I gotten into?
Newbies: "HOLY SHIT" Veteran hunters: *LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO*  I am so fucking hyped now, we're finally gonna get to hunt a fucking wrathful god again.
Does anyone here mind helping me beat alatreon I am a level 371 on Xbox but I just cant seem to beat him. he is the only monster in the game I haven't beaten any help would be nice (I also have the game on playstation but I would prefer to kill him on my xbox because that the one I have put the most time into)
Ok, if White Fatalis doesn't exist in World im okay with that. But at least put HIS THEME in this battle. That THEME is so LEGENDARY.
what is theme at the beggining? im loking for it
I like how every player is scared: The newbies: Are scared, because they do not know what or how powerful this monster is. The veterans: Are scared, because of how strong it is, and had fought this monster before. And the Average players: Are scared, because they know how powerful is, but havent fought this monster in his life. Truly, terrifying...
Welp, guess I'll be turning on my defense multiplier.
still haven't beaten altareon yet...
The flashbacks...crimson fatalis, fatalis....but oh lordie white fatalis 💀 where are my mh4u players at
I will........ become the next fatalis..... Humanity must pay for their sins.....
So is this a siege fight like safi or is this a fight like alatreon?
Everyone evacuate in an orderly fashion, no pushing, don't shove
I am fire. I am DEATH.
Tis a shame that white fatalis will not be in World.
Capcom, where's my Admiral Layered Armor?
the colors are coming, black,white and crimson red
Is this a new dlc coming out this year??
I really hope that Fatalis wont have the op area attacks like Alatreon. Yeah it can be challenging but not in the way that Alatreon is. Lets respect weaker players.
Who is willing to bet that this will be the hardest monster in mh franchise I know he was in older games but did u see what they did to alatreon, ya now u worried ? XD
Will definitely be more difficult than Alatreon, but will more than likely be more balanced.
Awesomeee! Compliments for MH. I'm looking forward to see the Crimson and White Fatalis❤️💗
Is Alatreon that hard ? i just started iceborne so it is easy until now
Me:yess fatalis already update I want Hunt alone to show who the master! Father:son....let me help you  Me:NO,I CAN DO IT MY SELF! Father:LISTEN TO ME NOOB!
if only we could take on all three fatalis in one castle, that would be god tier challenge
I've been waiting for this!!!!
the one hit god is back
The only monster I have never slayed solo back then when I was younger. I cannot wait to be Fatalis's armor on October 1.
The Excitable A Lister will not die REASON: (sorta)Spoiler Warning     It’s really simple, if he dies than it won’t make sense to anyone who has not even started the behemoth mission why he is suddenly alive.
Is it a dlc??
Cmon guys... Nno fear..... We have the weapon to stop this.... FISH
So I’m gonna disappear wearing that armor
Chills... Absolute chills... been waiting to hunt Fatalis again... been waiting to cry again... Thank you capcom!
This boss is the hardest boss its fatalis
Long live the king!
*puts on vesboi gear* Let's fucking do this.
For those of you that thought Alatreon was hard. . .you might as well delete your save file. Because you’re in for a rude awakening.
It would be good if they put the Khezu
The legendary destroyer has returned
I would be nervous  but I don't have the game, nor a platform to play it on
Well well well....if it isn't my old rival
Who is stronger? Fatalis or Alatreon?
woah next add dalmurdur
Man, as long as it doesn't have an annoying DPS check like Kulve and Alatreon, this fight should be awesome.
They fly now?
Wat the heck Fatalis!!!!
Yeah...Seems like we gonna be destroyed boys
I'm new in MH, is it stroneger then Alatreon?
0:45 this guy is dead jesus christ
The excitable a lister is dead and that’s sad
This is the real FINAL BOSS & Elder Dragon : Fatalis. Good Luck .🤣
....this isn't going to end well
Damn the new update for California  is looking fire
There is nothing my 755 base efr LS cant cut.
Real plot twist, they add in Crimson and White Fatalis just cause it’s the last update 😂 can only dream
Gripping my charge blade in fear  F-F-FELLOW HUNTERS MAY THE SAPPHIRE STAR LIGHT OUR WAY!!!!!
Fatalis: A few days ago three thugs tried to hunt me. Now, I want to be very clear about something... These pieces of garbage, they don't know who they're dealing with... Right, so these punks, I don't know if they wanted armour or if they wanted something more sexual. But, it's a lucky thing I had my fire... Anyway, I started burning. Now, I don't see so good, so I miss, then they ran away. I ran after them. Try to cart them from behind, but I don't run so good either. Anyway, you guys all think I'm history, and I'll accept that responsibility... Look, hunters in the New World are out of control. Thank Amatsu I went down to Castle Schrade and burnt another. I don't think one will do it. I'm gonna' go out and burn some more...
When are things going to change for the better? It takes for every to beat a monster. Nothing new, no imagination.
wonder if they will do that neat little thing where your hunter gets completely vaporize if they get hit by his oneshot attack instead of just getting carted
yes fatalis, finally!
Hello Old Friend
THE ENE IS HERE EVRYBODY, A HONOR FOR YOU'R KING THE FATALIS
I really hope Ace Cadet/A-Lister doesn't die, especially after the Tracker somehow survived her little tumble during Iceborne.
just....no dps check and we are fine :D
*Everybody gangsta until the god of monster hunter shows up*
me:at last old friend....... Fatalis :its been a while hunter......
Can someone explain why Fatalis is so a Big Thing?   Appearantly its from Mhw 1 but why is he so popular he looks for me like a normal dragon nothing else.  Does he have a Story in Mhw?
Pls be just a Hard fight without that Alatreon Checktest bullshit.
I'm super stoked for Fatalis and all, despite Crimson being my favorite... but I still have to ask: Where is mah boi Icy Shovel Chin? He's like... THE ice monster. Furthermore, where are Khezu, Gammoth, or Zamtrios?
Siri play one winged angel
Good Boyyo no
Fatalis, The Black Dragon King of the Elder Dragons🐉
Carts for the 40th time Me screaming like Vegeta:  I'M NOT....... DOOOOONNNEE!!!
Ohh... MY... CART!
Some advice to you new hunter which may get outdated when he is released. if he gets on all fours and looks like he is going to casually crawl, stay away.
As the handler says “hang on- now way” the bridge, the only exit is crumbling apart and falling
To all hunters. Let's challenge the legend together. 　　　　　　　　　　From a Japanese hunter
P is for priceless the look upon your faces.  E for extinction on all your puny races.  R for revolution that will be televised.  F is for how f%#ked you are. Now let me reprise.   E is for eccentric, just  listen to my song.   C is for completion that I've waited for so long.  T is for terror upon you out Bestow. My name is Fatalis ,and l would like to say ,  Hello.
2 days after fatalis update: "SPEEDRUN FATALIS 2:50 SOLO BOWGUN"
Please use his Original Sound kit the Scream is way more Epic. The Trailer fatalis sounds like a fart
*Longsword bounces off scales*  Fatalis: *About to breath fire in front of me that takes all my health* "I'm sorry little one..."
My birthday is on september 30th. Jesus capcom atleast let me enjoy being 20 before you triple cart me.
THEY ACTUALLY BROUGHT THE FATALIS BACK.   THIS FEELS LIKE I'M 12 AGAIN
Black admiral
the bgm is classic
Whenever I think about Fatalis coming to Iceborne, all that comes to mind is Ralph Wiggum from Simpsons chuckling and saying "I'm in danger."
Oh my god,okay its happening everybody stay calm
Holy Fucking Mother of Satan....    The First Final Boss, "The" Elder Dragon, The Monster that Hits like a Truck and can never be defeated unless fought with more than 1 Hunter, The Only Monster who made Rathalos' Theme sound like a Call From Heaven to send Judgement to Earth....    Gods have Mercy on us all....
1 week pass , 3 weeks to go .
If this doesn’t kill The Handler, nothing will.
I’m so hyped for this!
By my god damm bloody hunting horn... WTF is Samuel L. Jackson doing here
The only thing worse than a Fatalis, is meeting another large Elder Dragon. I can't remember but it's a HUGE snake that basically took a team of people just to hurt it.
Alatreon gave me chest pains and headaches. I really cannot wait to see what this little fella will do to me
Its been a pleasure my fellow hunters 🤧😭
The end is near.
just don't give it a dps check
This is good at all but where is my Gore Magala and the Hyper monsters??
But they will release the Black fatalis or the entire family, red white and miralis
New comer on MH: what is a Fatalis? Veteran hunter: Long time I haven't heard that name...
I just started playing mhw. Is this literally the last update? And then wait for another mh?
Called it!^^
Sadly bubble dragon wont be on MHW, kinda was hopping for it
So this is the new world disaster coming in October of 2020.
Let's get all the ogs from the game an start them lobbys because these new people aren't gonna make it lol
Finalllyyyyyy LET'S DO IT
Fatalis to all the other endgame dragons: seems like you need me to show you how its done
Alatreon: I AM DEATH INCARNATE!  Fatalis: That's the cutest shit I ever heard
There are way too many elder dragons in World. Wish they bulked up the regular monster roster instead.
I just notice that I can't beat alatreon so I can't beat Fatalis
HELL YEAH!!!!
I hope white fatalis came here too..
Confirmed info: only those who completed the Alatreon SA can fight Fatalis. He was just the initiation test!
Well now, it's my most hated monster. We have met again for the final battle, let it go down in the books of honor!😂🔪✌️
He isn't as strong as Great Jaggi!
Anyone here remember how the ace commander saved the ace cadet in a similar way in MH4?
Gentlemen, synchronize your death watches
Any CB main around here?
I wonder if they are talking about the ace hunters
Anjimmm fatalis 🤣
Geez, Fatalis looks freaking hungry, must've not ate in a long time...
only the black one ? the white and the red one were way more powerful
Wonder what the next huge update is gonna be...
The finale of monster hunter world iceborne updates  Ready yourselves in October 1st
At least let me kill alatreon first
danny duncan
I wanna see *Fatalis vs Safi Jiva*
How much i love to see fatalis eat the handler and get rid of her and her annoying voice
Why is when it was announced my siblings deleted my saved data of 1400hrs of the game and was close to getting all the gold crowns
Arch Tempered Nergigante: *laughs in instant kill divebomb*
Oh Shit....Here we go again. That ain't a monster....That is basically a Nightmare since MH1. Bring back old memories - 1HKO, Full Deflection, Can't get close to it when it moves, always fly up the sky.
Esto se va a poner feo
Oh no, here I tho alatreon is alr terrifying on MHW:Iceborne, and now the one and only Fatalis is comin...  Well its nice to play without stress.. such a good memories...
For those who have to fight that I am sorry for your controller and I hope you can buy a new one soon.
Yes happy so much.   I take this big game 70 euros and now its 25 gift like, and a continuiu game ice ice born 40 dollares.. nothing im just sad
Fatalis
Palace basically the King Ghidorah of monster hunter
Me a new hunter: Oh geez Alatreon really gave me a hard time, i wonder whats the next new mon-  Fatalis: *Your free trial of hunting has expired*
YEEEEES Finaly... since Freedom unite i missed  him so much... now he comes back to MHW.... Thats so Fu*kin Awesome
Fatalis! YAAAAAAAAAAAY! WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE IN A BLAZING, HELLISH INFERNO!
😳😬
Now i also want gogmazios 🤣🤣
Honestly I was hoping for White Fatalis instead of Black Dragon Fatalis, but I'm guessing White and Crimson will be in the next Monster Hunter
Me, only now dipping my feet into HR and squealing like a pig whenever i see Deviljho: *Now this looks like a job for me*
I want Arch Tempered Popo!
Holy guacamole, I get goose bumps from watching this....
Since Fatalis is here. Does this mean the Thunder King will come back?
The black dragon is here guys.... The blazing black dragon arrived first but no one can withstand the true black dragon
Think i use me Bowgun , looks easy , they said Alatreon was hard , but done that in less then 15mins , the test will be ? can this 1
Fatalis hunt is just a teaser for whats coming in the end of 2020
do you mean? Re-skinned Xeno-jiiva? opps
The king has returned
really want to play this game, can someone sponsor me for this game, :) :)
We need to see the White and Black Fatalis
Wow.
Imagine bringing back white fatalis. Won't happen now but imaging it.
Keep in mind that after beating alatreon it was stated that alatreon migrated for some unknown reason as veteran hunters those same words came to life when Lao Shan lung was running from fatalis history repeats itself even among black dragons
Noooooo
fingers crossed he doesn't have an unblockable unavoidable screenwide insta-death attack that can only be survived by an infight gimmick.
allow me to make this reference "At the edge of our hope, at the end of our time, we have chosen not only to believe in ourselves but in each other. Today there is not a man nor woman in here that shall stand alone. Not today. Today we face the monster that Are at our door and brings the fight to them! Today, we are canceling the apocalypse!"
I couldn't even beat alatreon
I can smell another nerf petition coming. MH2004 all over again, I wonder how many fatalis lancers are going to be in Iceborne this time around, and how many OG hunters are going to play HBG clust lvl2 and clust lvl3 against the OG black dragon.
See you next time on PS5 in open world MHW2 :)
Hunters: it's finally over, Alatreon's gone. Iceborne: Care to come back for Fatalis? Me: No, I don't think I will.
Comeing out on my birthday... My day of birth shall be my day of death
Dual blade main (me): Fuck this shit, let the gunlance mains handle this, Alatreon is already a problem for me, no way I am fighting THAT!
imagine white fatalis
Hunters, it's been an honor fighting with you these past two years. I'll see you all in October. Fight hard and stay smart, and may the sapphire star light your way.
I'm ngl, this fight better be harder than alatreon
It would be cool if there are forgotten hunter weapons scattered across the castle, each belonging to a previous hunter from the franchise (Like the Hero's Blade from MH1,a Nargacuga longsword from MHFU, etc). This would imply  that every other hunter from the previous games, our characters, failed to kill this dragon, therefore giving even more credit to its might.
We need lagiaaaa
These MHW players don't know about the ORIGINAL big bad...but they'll learn...   They will learn...
Ima say this now id pay for another expansion u can call it g rank or legend rank
As an orginal ps2 monster Hunter player be ready to die in one hit.  No joke this Dragon doesn't play nice. If they did him Justice like on PS2 were in for a heck of a fight. I loved fighting this Dragon in the old days and welcome back old friend you were missed now show us your power Oct 1 2020.
Noob here, who is this in the lore of the game?
Here we go, 11 years ago when I was 14 I fought you with my friends and we could never defeat you, my revenge is near Fatalis.
*Chuckles* I'm in danger.
Je suis monté.
"Die..Die...We All Pass Away.."
Beautiful.
I wouldn't be suprised if this was a raid shadow legends  boss battle. And what if they make fatalis do a move that was capable of killing everyone.
Death awaits us
The prophecy is true...  (watches fatalis disintegrate me into ashes)  Beautiful.. (dies)
Strangely ironic, I find it terrifying this might be the first time I see a hunter get literally killed on screen by A MONSTER.
*Get me a ballista, man the cannons, get that gesturing noob down from there and prepare the DRAGONATOR, a Fatalis has been sighted!!!*
I just want Akantor 😭😭
nooo excitable A-Lister, I need you to stay u were great in 4U pls :c
Prepare for the battle pf your lives
I wonder if God looks down at Fatalis from the heavens only to hide behind the clouds out of fear that this beast will bring Hell with it...
Alright babe  Lets rock with that creature
I explained to someone on Discord why Fatalis would body Nergigante and got banned.
When they said they were fighting history, they weren't kidding. There's even an old children's song detailing the coming of Fatalis...  The Legend of the Black Dragon:  When the world is full of wyverns  The legend is revived  Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched.  And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth  And melts through iron  He boils the rivers  And mows down trees  He awakens the winds  And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Call for help  Run for your lives  And don't forget to  Pray to the skies  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Fatalis, Fatalis  Heaven and Earth are yours  Fatalis, Fatalis  Heaven and Earth are yours
Here comes the fireball!
Ohhhh baby...
We can only pray that he does not herald the coming of his two brothers. FEAR the awakening of crimson and white.
Me half a year ago: "It will be crazy if they actually make Fatalis came to the World lol."  Dev: " Fatalis coming to world. "  Me: "we are going to diee."
The only Monster on iceborne that isn't on the new world
The arrival of Fatalis brought upon the death of the game  Guess it's fitting
Did the excitable hunter just get merked?!
KYAAAAAAAAAAAA KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA <3<3<3<2<3<3<3333 you'reback <3
I heard you have to beat alteron to fight fatalis is this true I hope not
So if they really kill off the excitable hunter here, maybe that then also means that in the future we can choose what handler we want, as serious handler has no hunter anymore.
I'm sorry- WHAT-?!  I'M GETTING SOME SERIOUS PTSD HERE!!!!
all that's left is Plesioth with it's enormous hitbox to complete the trio
Well then, it's been a good game. Boutta through this controller in the fire.
AWSOME !!!!!!     what about gore magala and lagiacrus ?
Ah finally, a challenge!
EVERBODY PREPARE AND SUMMON THE 5 HUNTING HORN MAINS AND ALL THE HEALING BUFFS U CAN SPAM
I just realised that iceborn was basically a preorder dlc....
Am I the only one getting heavy Dragon's Dogma Grigori vibes from the fiery wrath that this trailer is showing of the Fatalis?
Please rework the weapons.. the old versions from old franchise looks so basic.. doesn't fit the name Armageddon Dragon himself. Please rework it and give it justice.
The real final boss of the series
BLESS ME HOT FISH!!!
I want to be excited but after Alatreon I am not expecting this to be a fun (or good) fight
Me and the boys when we saw this  https://youtu.be/tKNNE3fOQ7I
I would like to know the name of this song.
Yeah... No.
Oh my god I can’t wait for this to come out
Anyone remember those rumours about the White Fatalis Armour turning hunters into White Fatalis? Good times.
When you see the reveal of Fatalis being added to world: Oh yes. Fatalis is in world!  When you realize that Fatalis has been added to world: OH NO. FATALIS IS IN WORLD
Awh shit here we go again.
i don't know how hard it' is going to punch us. to me, Alatreon was hard and painful until i realised some mistakes i made with my armor and weapons. now it's better.... but this.... this is making me smile.   No greatest time to smile and shine, than before death itself.
0:07 My totally Original Character do not steal.
The hunter: Die monster! You don't belong in this new world!!  Fatalis: It was not by my hand that I once again given model. I was called here by human who wish me comes to the new world and join the party.  The hunter: "Party"? You steal castle and make people your armor(scales).  Fatalis: Perhaps the same could be said of all hunting.  The hunter: Your words are as empty as your soul! Mankind ill needs a legend such as you!  Fatalis: What is a hunter? *throws his wine glass aside* A greedy little pile of secerts! But enough talk! Have at you!
Finally
Arch Dodogama will save us!
We did good hunters...we did good
For those in the comment section who don’t understand the hype around Fatalis, as well as the growing sense of dread over the encroaching end, Fatalis is the reason that Monster Hunter is a post-apocalyptic world where human presence is scarce. In the official lore, Elder Dragons are said to be the physical manifestations of natural disasters, and certain other phenomena. (Kirin=Lightning Storm, Kushala Daora=Hurricane, Teostra=Firestorm, etc.) Fatalis is the Elder Dragon that symbolizes the Apocalypse. When this thing showed up, it literally brought the end of the world with it. Other elder dragons may be bigger and stronger physically, but the Fatalis is the literal top of the food chain. Unrivaled in intimidation, as well as destructive power/potential. The new world is fucked. Pack your shit, and get on a boat.
The nightmare continues
fatalis: welcome to the hell hunter
I JUST GOT A MASSIVE MONSTER HUNTER WORLD HORSE HUNG GUNG HO ERECTION
Lets not say that this is goodbye. Lets just say- Fatalis: You’re gonna die~
we are fcked up
Omg thats fake or real pls
Finally,a worthy enemy for my 95% affinity IG
Oh my the old fatalis, I'm looking forward to slaying it.
I just hope this doesn't turn into ANOTHER mess of  You NEED 4 hunters You NEED the perfect builds You NEED synchronized cooperation You NEED to pass a damage check  Basically, I hope this will turn out fun rather than a chore.
Fatality KO
Never played the previous monster Hunter so I am basically here hyped
Ok, gotta start grinding my rank and decos
This is giving me massive Godzilla vibes, especially the anime Godzilla movies
Long live the king=FATALIS
I hope they somehow sneak white fatty into this
1. He looks sick 2. Is he going to be soloable 3. Please tell me he isn’t as boring or dull as the original 4. any possibility that we also get white and crimson as well
Me, a Newbie to the franchise: They're fighting history? What, did something jump through time or is it an ancient--? Fatalis: *Ungodly hell screeching and apocalyptic incineration* Me: 0-0
*F is real*
I only played MHW, this guy seems rather "normal"
I expect to see a lot of newbies fainting because of trying to fight Fatty face-to-face than hitting him on the **** ** *** ****. Hah! Got'em! Won't reveal anything about how to kill Fatty in the easier way.(Im so evil)
While reading everyone saying how powerful Fatalis is, well *sips tea* just wait when the White Fatalis will be announced for World.
The appearance of Fatalis and no hunter can defeat him. Fatalis = GOD.  After reported by the loser hunter about "Fatalis is too OP". Fatalis = a cat.
I wonder if they'll show some children singing "The legend of the Black Dragon" before they departed to the Castle
Me with my hammer: oh a big lizard Fatalis stands up Me: so you have chosen death
It can't be worse than the Alatreon right?
The thing I'm most hyped about is that guardian armor with the visor down
Please cap com no dmg check and please have him a high level not 24
Gentlemen synchronize your death watches
When capcom will release gore magala in iceborne????
*Sees Fatalis in the distance and starts playing Closer My God To Thee on Hunting Horn, while my teammates and palico join in*   "Gentlemen, it has been a privilege hunting with you tonight."
From a person who plays mhgu ALOT and fights black, crimson, white, fatty. me watching this be like           ITS ABOUT F###### TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That is one "BIG" nope rope.
*HUNTERS THIS IS OUR LAST STAND WE SHALL FIGHT TILL OUR FINAL BREATHS TO SLAY FATALIS THE BLACK DRAGON OF DESTINY...HUNTERS SAY IT ONE LAST TIME WITH ME...HAPPY HUNTING!!!!!*
We're all gonna die....
I remember back in the days I used to hunt this thing to extinction just for a damn armor set
I just pray that we'll get to see Nergigante fight him. Us and Nerg boy vs the big black dragon. Make it happen.
Well uhh this is hella dope.
When are they gonna let us hunt Godzilla?
Spoiler: Fatalis don't play
Rain fireeeeee!!!          Ops, it was it's red brother...sorry... jeje
NOOO I HAD MHW ON MY PS4 BUT I GOT IT FROM PS + ):
How does the music keep getting better in this game
Wait does this mean that safi'jiiva evolved into fatalis after absorbing a black dragon? Or no?
I think I’m gonna nut
#FREEICEBORNE
PRAISE HIM!
I wish they used white fatalis theme
Monster hunter: Our fans want fatalis, let's give it to them for free as a surprise gift, make a trailer, new area, new weapons and armour, and even throw in the epic cutscene. Hope they like it c:   Pokemon: Oh the fans want the rest of the pokemon we've kept from them. Guess it's time to do a long drawn out dlc, hide it behind a paywall, and throw on some more stuff even if they don't wanna pay for the extra if they want the rest of their pokedex. Hope the community doesn't fight over whether or not our company sucks. Or does, whatever. Either way we still need that $$$. Screw ya diamond and pearl remakes tho, we're the boss not you D:<   P.s. Please kill off the handler. No one likes her. Thanks
im dissapointed because our handler is not get burned by fatalis
The original comment was from a long time ago, but I updated it.  Fatalis:"So I heard You adressed a lowly Alatreon as the strongest?" Hunters:"T-That decision was taken with way too much hurry Your brilliance!"  Fatalis:"Like how I've decided to kill You where You stand?"
I've watched this like 30 times now
Caralhooooo o Fatalis está no novo mundo que fodaaaa
Why did they change the roar though
* *giggles* * I'm in danger...
Get ready for the Cart Fest!
As someone who has never played previous titles I have no idea what I'm getting myself into xD
Dude I saw this and started giggling like a school girl, I now get to die again to this thing in HD
To bad I don’t have teammates
now my video makes sense
your mom's an elder dragon!
They stole my hot fish. I burned their cart.
Hot fish is upon us
t a i l d e f l e c t h o u r s
"stay ignorant of what true fear is."
El 1 de octubre será un gran día para morir!!
To all my fellow hunters, it has been an honor, what an amazing trip this has been, here is hoping that we only need to wait for 5 years until the next Monster Hunter game, until then, HAPPY HUNTING!!!!
It’s time for all of the old and new hunters it’s time to fight a god once more happy hunting everyone
MHGU/MHXX Aerial DB squad: our real estate has finally come.
Fatalis finalmente chegou no MHW 👍🙌
Welcome back my lord, hope u won’t be mad at us in the new world..... oh wait you always mad.
(Warning: Cheesy lol)  I may have joined the Monster Hunter community through World, and it may have been my first and only Monster Hunter game, and I may only know the lore and tales veterans tell of the 'God of all monsters', but one thing is for certain: As a Hunter, going up against a foe of immeasurable strength, I will not retreat, I will not stop fighting, until I am the victor. Fatalis, I've fought through everything in World and Iceborne to reach this point, and as a Hunter, I will do what I was meant to do: For Humanity, and for the whole World, with my Charge Blade I will make you bleed, and this fight will be...  The Proof of a Hero!
O ctmre como que el fatalis ya lo encuentro sobrevalorado y además sus peleas eran muy aburrida ojalá que sean más divertida está ves
Hey it's my old punching bag, really hopes that they make him a real fight. can't wait
Me: yes finally defeated alatreon!!!  Fatalis: allow me to introduce myself   Me: oh fu**!!!!!!😫
I’m getting a demon souls vibe from this
Seriously this game is one of the best of the generation . The content . The effort . Just everything as a whole . I wish more games were like this . Fatalis has me hyped
Well... [Prepares Bow] ... Today's a good day to die!
It was an honor hunting with you I will always remember you
where's the dragonator!!??
Will this majestic creature finally be the one to kill the handler? I have high hopes
Hold my Hunting Horn.
00:45 Run!  that's right, run!
a few more hours boyz
1000x screams later cant stop watching...
Nah that's cool I wasn't hoping for a good time or anything
Arch-Tempered Poogie when
The sky darkens and it rains fire and darkness = FATALIS DRAGON OF THE LEGEND
Veterans: Yay Fatalis is here...  *1 second later* Oh fuck! Fatalis is here!
Me: (sees this)   Me inside: *PTSD INTENSIFIES*
Excitable A-lister is tied into this because he’s a hunter who slayed a fatalis and lived through the corruption in turn making him immortal, so when his first body died he became the Excitable A-lister. My theory makes no sense but it’s fun regardless. :>
*When the world is full of wyverns The legend is revived Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched. And blood is sucked up dry He burns the earth And melts through iron He boils the rivers And mows down trees He awakens the winds And lights an inferno* -He is called Fatalis!
Hold up I just realized..... Did the A lister die???
Veteran Hunters: "Haha, I'm in danger!"
I’m surprised no one is talking about the possible new theme. That raising chorus... it’s absolutely chilling!! It’s almost on parallel with bloodborne and maybe even dark souls; Everytime I replay this I get shivers!
White Fatalis is going to be Heaven Shattering for sure.
GIVE PRAISE FOR HE HAS NO EQUAL
Those choirs are the voices of the hunters who failed to slay it and are now melted into its scales. I missed that lol
WHYYYYY ? If this is the final update why is it ragequit alatreon 2.0 ? Why not something fun like a suuuuuper big endemic life update or a underwater update ? Or a that virus dragon so we could have infected variants added.
I always find it funny how all these veteran players act as if any monster they introduce is super od. Fatalis gets merked constantly in every mh he's been in.
Me after hard bullying alatreon to the ground at release: Finally a worthy opponent ! Our battle will be legendary !
Fellow hunters. Our Alatreon weapons finally have purpose.
There better not be a one hit kill mechanic again or I'm gone
Ah, that old friend from PSP Monster Hunter Freedom Unite... The memories
This is scary and horrifying but also I'm weirded out since alatreon came to the new world to fight savijiva or wipe out its nest we left an alatreon carcass sitting in a nest that could stretch for miles meaning one xenojiva could've survived hmmm
me over here still haven't been able to beat alatreon lmao xD
So is this the last update MH will get?
Capcom....... Why...........
*cries in solo hunter*
Iceborne players : *finally beats Alatreon*  Capcom: “SO YOU’VE CHOSEN DEATH”
*Just hearing the theme alone is giving me goosebumps, holy hell...* 😱
I hope Fatalis still has that EEEEEEE roar
It's been a long time, I never thought I'd be standing here once again. History? I'll gladly go down as the man who chickened out against God itself
He'll probably evolve and turn into White Fatty at the last phase and start shooting red lightning bolts
But.. but.. fear
Tonight we dine in hell
We're...not going to be okay...
Oh boy, I can't wait to explode again
The fatalis the monster stated to have destroyed the ancient civilization The Crimson Fatalis known to have such hatred for humanity it has melted hunters and their armor adding it to it's hide and increasing it's deadliness The white Fatalis  A Fatalis said to have lived an extremely long life and having reached it's greatest form of power
Me with a party of scarred hunters: hold your ground! hold ground! Men of  the old world, of the next generation, my brothers.. I see in your eyes, the terror that would petrify entire universes. A day may come when we abandon all hope and strength of humanity fails us all, but it is not this day. Mountains weapons and armor will turned to dust when the age of the hunter fail, but it will never be this day. THIS DAY WE FIGHT. By all that you hold dear in this new land. I BID YOU STAND WITH ME, WARRIORS OF THE NEW WORLD!!!
If you thought alatron was a problem than get ready
The Guild:We need you to fight Fatalism, you are our sapphire star, our hope!  Me: I think I'm gon a boycott life...
Wait Does the excitable hunter die?
NO. DAMAGE. CHECK.
Bring amatsu back,we need some water elder dragon
Hunters, its been a damn honor hunting with you these past few years.
A while back, Dragalia Lost did a crossover event with Monster Hunter. I've never played any of the Monster Hunter games but after seeing some of the recent stuff, I REALLY want to.
Listen if Capcom tries to pull the Alateron fight again by making an "ultimate attack" you have to rely on your shitty allies to not get caught up in it then I'm gonna be pissed :/
Well, it appears to be that noobs from reddit started crying about how strong alatreon is, welp Capcom fix it by giving you a much stronger one, Happy hunting :)
Is the reason fatalis woke up because he somehow knew we killed alatreon and feels threatened that the humans are becoming to powerful again?
Sooooooooooo... uh, if Ace kicks the bucket can we, uh, idk... get the Serious Handler? Fatty can wait, Serious Handler is more important.
I remember when i was a wee little hunter. Started with freedom unite, got my ass torn up. Finally got to fatalis and never could beat him. 24 years later, i’m ready for my revenge!  I shall slay the beast and wear its flesh!
That soundtrack... the sound that threatened my life encountering Rathalos back in Monster Hunter PS2.. I just realised, Rathalos theme in world been composed differently than the original.. Now this bring back the epicness and dread.
No monster can hope to stand against the power of the fo- *sees Fatalis* I pledge myself to your teachings.
New players:oh cool a dragon The veterans:oh god oh frick
Mohawk rolled a 1.
So... what's special about this one?
Not gonna lie I was devastated when I saw this. For many Fatalis is smth they wanted to see for the end of Iceborne. But after all the hints and eastereggs over the last 3 years. The blue fire in the rotten vale. The skeleton of the rotten vale. It was one big Dalamadur and I truely hoped and believed to see him bringing the end to iceborne. Especially after all the siege fights comming into MH with kulve tarroth and Safi. But bringing Fatalis in as a last update also means there is no Dalamdur comming. And thats really sad for everyone seeing the signs and hoping for it. I hope he will come back in the next game. He is the one to shake the earth
We all know where this is going.. End is near.. Put some salsa.. On hot fish..
I've killed a fatalis by myself before but I'm still fucking terrified
Please no artificial difficulty, I want to face the true and natural difficulty of fatalis himself, I want to feel his power, his strength, his punches...
Yeah, this was to be expected. Alatreon is probably considered a challenging warm-up compared to the OG elder dragon arriving in October. Well it seems that the rapture is upon us...
World's final fight.. who's ready?
It looks smaller than safi ....
I really hope the last event quest will be to face Arch-Tempered Fatalis.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This will be my first time truly facing Fatalis. I've fought it in the Dragalia Lost Primal Crisis raid, but not in an actual Monster Hunter game. I feel that the Excitable A-Lister put it best. I'm not fighting against just another elder. This is *the* Black Dragon. The monster that ripped Schrade apart. The one that single-handedly destroyed an entire civilization.   It's... history. And one way or another, that's what we'll become.
Hope they add all three Fatalis though, love Crimson Fatalis dual blades and Lance.
I'm scared
Kinda feel like Behemoth's theme would work with Fatalis.
I swear to god if the Handler says “hang on” or “no way” one more time I’m going to flip a table
I'm hoping that they can design a moveset for him that makes the fight fun and challenging without relying on an instant wipe supernova mechanic again.
so is this the last update?
welp... played every monster hunter game fatalis was in... and we are officially dead. pls capcom dont add white fatalis.
Alatreon: noooo I’m being countered :’( Fatalis: lemme show you how to scratch it
He's going to make Alatreon look like a f***ing joke... And I still haven't even beaten Alatreon. T_T
F for ace cadet
New Hunters: *Why do we hear boss music?* Veterans: NIGERUNDAYOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
I hope they could add Crimson Fatalis as AT Fatalis. And we fights it in burnt Astera because it destroried the base for it's revenge. And we need to defend the new world.
Why do i feel like he will have a shitty one shot move that's unavoidable like Alatreon
Heres hoping hes an actual fight, not an arcade gimmick or just a monsters that's sits and sits there
The title of the series is a play on words. You are a hunter who hunts monsters. But Fatalis is a monster hunter too, as he hates all living things. He also hunts humans, which are the monsters who kept killing monsters.
I’m calling it, the second Monster in this update is Niga’jiiva.
Cant wait for what killer of an ost Fatalis has when it comes out
Little do people know that all this update is going to be is this.      https://youtu.be/-ZGlaAxB7nI
NPC: what we're up against isn't a monster.. it's actually history Fatalis: why i hear boss music? Some old player: Je suis Monte!!!
"goodbye world"
I've waited 10 years for this moment.  I couldn't do it on Freedom, I couldn't in Freedom Unite, this is my last chance.
Hopefully it kills The Handler
Oh look, one of the good things from 2020
The Fall of Castle Schrade. Now that's a movie i would watch.
The A lister sacrifices himself to save the sapphire star, the sapphire star then proceeds to solo fatalis with a really specialised build.
*"The hour of turning back is past. The world will finally have its answer : You, or Me? Death, or Life beyond? If you would gain aught, give your all here and now! Such is the contest you have chosen!"*
that it? with this the title is dead?
Oh come on! We’ve just fended off that Tacoheaded elder! *as Alatreon is snarking somewhere*
I am buying this gane
One word EPIC!!!!!
Gentlemen,  We are truly, truly, fucked
guess Team Darkside will hunt Fatalis like a rat with wings in less than a day.
Random idiot newbie : is this Daora Sub  Old hunters: *triggered*
Please bring me a red boi as well, white lad is ok too, but red boi is needed in my life
Alright ugly round 2
Fatalis is hype as hell, but I *PERSONALLY* hope it won't rely on a fight gimmick like Alatreon and instead simply be a straightforward, hard as fuck moveset. Even an Arch-Tempered style where they deal crazy high damage is IMO preferable to "Make a build like this, or you will die".
And me still here being uncapable of killing lastreon 🤭🤭
Still waiting for Capcom to add a meta Plesioth quest where they add the OG model of the plesioth with the OG hitbox
FIVER BRO NO !
Fatalis of mh 2
I hope this music gets more and more intense🙏🤜🤛🐉🐉 My body is ready!!
*sees slaying alatreon as a requirement to face fatalis  so escaton judgement literally  judged those who are deemed worthy of even facing fatalis
Betting my life savings that the victory theme for Fatalis will be the original MH's Triumph ost, as opposed to Ala's mhtri victory theme.     I'd prolly stand corrected
And I haven't even beat Alatreon yet
Heaven and Earth are not yours... *It's his.*
Jfc... so many cringe comments below. It's sad to see that most of MHW's playerbase consists of 13 year olds.
Je l'avais pas affronté depuis MHFU. J'espère que son combat va lui rendre honneur.
Welp, Here we go guys....
I’m terrible at video games so I don’t play, but I’d like to offer my sincerest condolences because you’re all gonna die. Rest in pieces. 😔
Ah, dearly detested dragon, come back again, have you? This thing is a terror and I feel that the New World will deliver us a version that makes us regret existing. At the very least, this one is not White.
new generation, good luck, you will need it 😏😏😏
The living cataclysm is back.....     Shit... Edit: What about Dread King?
i dont remember but who is the stronger fatalis this one or the white one with beard ?
All the pro monster hunters who played MH since ps2 are ready for this💪 we faced him before even his stronger forms (Devil Fatalis and Heavenly) we ARE READY!!!!!!
The Dragon God have finnaly come to lay its judgment...
Pls fatalis-sama kill some npcs, especially the handler!
Welp, Looks like the Dragon Emperor is back from his nap time
The people who disliked are the same people Alatreon folded and are gonna get clapped by Fatalis now.
We’re gonna die, aren’t we.
I can use again the pun " How  F A T A L "
Was expecting albino pukei-pukei but ok :(
That guy better be the ace gunner's father or something
They said alota rumors this is gonna wrap it up for monster hunter world   It’s been great hunting with you  Hunters  I’ll see you in the hunt😔
New hunters: Jeez what a powerful looking foe. We really need to prepare for this.       Me: Wait until you see his brothers.
We all knew it was gonna happen lol its not like it wasn't super predictable.
And now I shall have to start a new Hunter and play all the way to this and then fight history. It's been an honor, but we're about to become it's hide. Ltierally
So we're back to where it all began, the very Castle where we first met Fatalis.
>October 1st  *Just in time for the Skeleton War*
finally the invincible is back soon it will be the most epic battle of all HUNTERS of the old guard and New generation this will be the legendary ending
Guys. Just keep in mind. Fatalis isn't that bad if you don't get hit. ;D
I can’t think of a better way to describe Fatalis.   Referring to him as history, well done Capcom
the youtube's Fatalis Experience gonna be great...
Hell yes!
They brought a black guy in to tell us the black dragon is back...
lol comes out my birthday haha
Help....
I really hope it doesnt have a dps check
Meenwhile in its production theyre gona find some jarjar binx style bs to insert handler in and confuse fatalis for food cause when ij doubt *take a bite*
Iceborne player: Oh wow new monster! MH Vets: Ah, we meet again. Iceborne player who actually read up on the history: Shit I need to git gud, grind those mats, git gud, forge new gear, learn how to dodge, upgrade new gear, git gud, make a meta build, learn what the hell i-frames are and how to use them... [preparation intensifies]
OMFG FATALIS holy crap they are bringing out the big guns
1st if our hunter bro is going to die i will be pissed.  2nd. As someone who has the rule to hunt most monsters alone on the 1st time before hunting them in a group. I just can say: oh boy that looks like pure horror. And Palico be ready to hunt
Well now not even speed runners can surpass him
nergigante cant save them this time. fatalis is the strongest.
the mewtwo of monster hunter.
Maybe, just maybe, papa Fatalis can kill all of those annoying ass npc's.
Oh mi DIOSS!!!!!!
Who's the cool new hunter dude? I want his hairstyle
You guys thought diablos charge was bad w8 till u fight this bad boi
Everyone talking like fatalis was actually hard.
I ain't even beat alatreon yet and they already coming out wit something that harder
So looking forward to fatalis! I remember looking like a dragon with it's armour in the previous PSP games.
So what is going to happen to weekly challenges when the game gets it's final update and the server will need to be shut down to be used for it's future installments.
I already see those damn ridiculous scoped hbg under 5 min speedruns. Or pierce lbg...
It’s happening... the final showdown get ready this may be the last fight we will ever have.
I'm so glad I learned about this monster so I can die in the best way possible
Do yall think they gon add White and Crimson someday?
Imagine Fatalis special abilities uninstall your game.
Can’t wait for reddit to complain like bitches like they did with alatreon
Every Single Hunter: * Exists *  Fatalis: _You have forfeited your life privileges_
yeah bois im backkk
Exciteable A-lister : *dies* Me, realizing serious hunter gonna be free : 👁️👁️ I don't hate the guy, he is pretty cool whenever we pass the mr limit and he goes to list all monster he can just to show how excited he is, imma miss him
Me: *hasn't even killed Alatreon yet* Devs: lets add Fatalis...
Me with my HH TuT
So I guess everybody will be Prince Phillip against old school Dragon Maleficent... Just saying https://youtu.be/DTDb4G-v9zw been a long run for me since 2002
Fatalis? No problem, Aimbot Rajang is here to take care of him >~> ...
Welcome to yharnam
I am Vietnamese, I just started this channel, I hope to receive everyone's help. Thank you channel owner and everyone
i adore that newbies actually have to beat alatreon before they get to fatalis. at least its a tiny skill check lmao
I've Waited 5 Goddamn Years For This! I Couldn't Fight It In MHGU or Such Cuz Only Had The PSP To Fight It Off In MHFU....I'm Super Hyped Baby!!
With fatalis and alatreon back, I bet dire miralis is up next
If you only played MHW and still think Alatreon is the hardest  Then get ready... Because Fatalis is gonna snake walk over you, over and over again!  God that Snake walk... You were dead if it hit you in a corner... That damage... That hitbox... Yeah you thought his fire beam, atomic fireball, body slam or tail sweep are the attacks to look out for. Hell nah! It's the walking attack!
*Every monster is slayed or capture*  Fatalis:am history  The player that mastered fatalis:your not history,am history
One final fight, old friend.
Fatalis feels, what is probably the most simple and basic design out of all monsters in the series. But even today, it manages to give you such unique, epic and badass vibes, that no other monster can give you. Truely outstanding.
Junk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MczMPC3sFJ0&t=52s
epic
\o/ time for instant quest fails!! \o/
A way to avoid all hell. Kill it, but never carve it.
Can we please talk about the divine chorus at 00:09? I so hope thats also part of his battle theme
Fatalis = Scrap Dragon with reuse armor and bone
Newbies hunters: Damm! Alatreon is the hardest boss we ever fought!  Alatreon: I was only the peak of the iceberg.  🎶Fatalis theme Playing🎶  Newbies Hunters: *is that a boss music?!*  Veterans: Ah sh*t! here we go again...
History is repeating itself.
Fatalis: _fun is over, take of your shirt_
ace cadet even tried to help the hunter by boosting him abit :'( i hope theres more story about him in this update
That roar is amazing
Fatalis means TO BE FATED BY DEATH
HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i hope the white one come too😢
WAKE UP! The Tribulations are coming very soon! Jesus will be returning near the end of the tribulations! Repent now! Turn away from your sins and follow Jesus Christ who died for your sins! All the world events have been prophesied, they have been predicted in the Bible and are happening right now! Storms, earthquakes, flooding, fires, locusts, asteroids, and rioting (lawlessness/sin). Wars are coming! Many nations are going to form an alliance and attack Israel. There are going to be famines and tons of extreme destructive weather and sickness. The world is going to follow the New World Order in which everyone is united under one government and it will be an evil one. They will pretend to be peaceful and loving, but when the time comes they will tear the world apart and start killing everyone. "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. (Matthew 24:7 King James Version)" "And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. (Luke 21:11 King James Version)" "And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke (Joel 2:30 King James Version)" . You are all sinners, just like me! You are wicked and live in lies! Repent now or you will be thrown into the pit of fire! The wages of sin are death! "23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23 King James Version) Here is the good news! You can be saved, and taken out of the world before this time comes and be with Jesus Christ! "16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16 King James Version)" "15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: (1 Corinthians 15:1-4 King James Version)" . ABC's of Salvation (How to be Saved): "9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Romans 10:9-10 King James Version)" Admit you're a sinner and that you need to be saved and forgiven, and that you can't enter into Heaven by your own works but by Jesus Christ. Believe in Jesus Christ truly with all your heart and that He died on the cross for your sins, and rose on the third day. Commit/Call to God with all of your heart, and pray to God. Ask for forgiveness and to be given the gift of salvation and to be sealed by the Holy Spirit. REPENT! . Then continue to walk in His light, and hold His hand and let Him guide you through life and protect you. No one can take you out of His hand. "28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.  29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.  30 I and my Father are one. (John 10:28-30 King James Version)" . "40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. (John 6:40 King James Version)" . Thanks be to God forever and ever! Glory be to God forever and ever! God bless you! God bless President Trump! Amen.
A random thought:  What if we can't kill Fatalis in this update. Instead, we get to earn the rewards/materials to craft the armor, weapons etc. by SURVIVING for a set period of time?  I feel like that the only time fatalis would be killed is the time where he and Xeno/Safi's final form fight to the death while hunters join the fray.  Giving the players the satisfaction of saving the word from 2 world-ending monsters. A clash of New and Old.
Imagine fighting Phase 2 Fatalis
After that  The Moon turns into an Eclipse
Veterans, remember that day we used to ragequit countless times because Yian Garuga just wouldn't seem to limp? And how loud did we cry when we realized that he was just 1% of what Fatalis is? XD
Did they just kill the excitable a-lister aka the only person in this game that actually hunted something to make equipment

*Hey to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
I am shitting my pants
Fatalis is just a dragon who likes his peace and quiet. He gets awfully cranky when noisy people wake him up from his favorite napping spot. He loves barbecue! His brisket and pork butt were so good that Lao Shan Lung rushed home to tell his friends! He hasn't come back yet and Fatalis is getting a bit worried that he got lost along the way...  It looks like Fatalis was in the middle of remodeling and decided to take a nap after a hard day's work. But of course, he just can't seem to nap in peace...
Poot pat
Wonder if he will still have OHKO Snap’n’drag?
New monster hunter players be making up all kinds of lore...the veterans know that’s capcom barely thought up any lore behind most of the monster hunter games. There’s nothing to support an ancient war, its just implied that fatalis is a dragon that took over a kingdom and made its roost in the castle.
And why isn't this #1 on Trending?? Its Trending on Twitter
Me when hot pocket done:
Tbh I hope they make the fight interesting. I always thought fatalis was a lot more boring than alatreon. Was kinda hoping they would introduce a new elder dragon fight.
Hehehe......see everyone at the afterlife
Nice
Still no gore magala
I think I'm gonna cry. Years of hunts, all lead up to this.  To all my fellow hunters, may the Sapphire Star light your way.
If the Handler dies by Fatalis, I see this as a win.
OH MY GOD YES!!!
There goes my sharpness
I’ve predicted this monster ever since the Anniversary of them doing monster size comparisons. It’s finally time....     *It’s dragonslaying boys.*
Capcom testing their Dragon technology for Dragon's Dogma 2 (?)
I carted just by watching this
I've never been afraid of a monster. Not Xeno, not Shara, not Furious Rajang, and not even Alatreon... But this... this scares me.. more than I ever thought I'd be afraid of any monster
Team Darkside about to kill Fatalis with Slinger Ammo only and not even carve it, mark my words.
its roar though, wonder if it's gonna be like alatreon so alien, that will be wonderful.
Praying for the fight to not include some gimmicky Onehit move yet again.. Seriously just let us fight, even if the fucking time runs out after 30-50 minutes, I'd feel better than having to think about some sort of DPS check.
To the person reading this: your a very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy during quarantine! Stay safe. :)
Lmao we dead
This fight is gonna be the same as Dark Souls
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos✌️Non-Duality
All of the fighting that we have done has led up to this moment let us all stand together and we might be able to defeat the god of all monsters fatalis
Hell yeah my boy fatalis
RIP Chameleos- he never got to hang out with his buddies in the New World
Please tell me I wasn't the only one who was in literal tears watching this and the whole rest of the dev diary
I like how the dragon doesn’t even look that menacing but I would definitely be scared of that thing in irl
Much better if they improve Fatalis attacks like ehhhh... Fatalis shoot black flames ala Kalameet from Dark Souls that would be cool 😎
Capcom: *only adds regular Fatalis*  Crimson and White Fatalis: Are we a joke to you?
Looks fun
I just hope nothing bad happens to the excitable A-lister
can't wait to farm this guy :^)
I’m so hyped!!!
This is awsome and all but i wish capcom would stop locking all these cool monster hunts behind HAVING to do the previous one..  Been a fan since MH3U but me and my friends wish they would just make another huge expansion (like Iceborne), rather than just adding more and more harder and harder fights to MHW:I.  We do love the series but people are going to be put off if they keep doing this and making the fight stupid hard.  Plus the rest of 'the big 4' arent added, e.g Gammuto (the giant ice mammoth isnt in ICEborne... yes) and older monsters like Qurupeco or even Great Jaggi need some love too, not just huge really hard dragon monsters
"This... is Alatreon." Veterans: Dear God... "There's more." Veterans: *No...*
*Long neck*  Le gasp   Lagiacrus will be ba-  Capcom: this is the final free update  *Sad noises*
*sees fatalis*  Me: *Remembering suppressed Fear*
*Long neck*  Le gasp   Lagiacrus will be ba-  Capcom: this is the final free update  *Sad noises*
Yesss I’m ready to get one shotted once fatalis takes a single step
i swear to GOD if this thing has another bullshit ohko...
YEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS! The return of the calamity. BRING IT FOOL!
So...it gets an AOE instakill or big damage that can be resisted?
New fairy tales, Now fall the veils: We have Fatalis With Fat-tails!
For a second I thought this was a Wings of Fire Movie trailer but no.
I want fatalis’ super nova to be called fatal error
you have know Idea how long I've waited for this, this brings a tear to my eye.
Me as my MHW character : I slayed the Emperor of saphire I slayed the Golden queen I slayed the Blazing black dragon that was sent to judge me Now I must face the Legend to become one   My MH4U character who slayed ALL Fatalis : well yes but actually...no
Escaton judgement 2.0
Маша
i had hoped it would be the dire Miralis
Fatalis? Sounds like an enhancement that'll kill you after you ejaculate
Saludos! Si hoy por hoy la leiste, estoy segura de que estas de acuerdo que la pagina de Ana Cikensel dice las cosas como son. Puedes esperar a poder quedar embarazada en 2 meses, sin tener que someterte a rituales mágicos o procedimientos medicos.
I‘m just praying it‘s not an annoying forced coop fight like Kulve, Safi or Behemoth
So did alister die at the end there?
Si van asagar este nuevo monstruo es pero guando fatalis lo sacan en Japón y tanvien guando podré pasar en el aisvur podré de nener
🖕
Lol it got on trending.
Literally just nicknamed my shiny Mega Charizard Y in Pokemon Go Fatalis.  Oh irony. How rich you are.
0:09 this part makes me feel small like a ant but technically that's exactly what you are to *FATALIS THE BLACK DRAGON*
hello I'm back for my hourly viewing of this trailer
Here's something about MH Lore for you Fivers: ALL of MH games are in a  post apocaliptic war world.  *_That guy is a third of the entire enemy side._*
So, a bog standard dragon?
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18
Remember hunters, if you makes weapons out of him they will probably make you go mad
Hunter: Oh yeah bois, we're in the endgame now Fatalis: I am inevitable
I can finally get my revenge!  I was never able to beat this one as a kid.
0:10 to 0:24 is like.. my favorite part of the music.   I really hope there’s phases and the second phase starts when you use the dragonator and it plays the original testament of a hero, that would really tie in the whole game and this quest as the final and conclusive quest of world/iceborne
I am Japanese hunter
God begone!
Honestly I thought you guys were going to add few more monsters from the old games before putting this guy😅
Me sees this after getting mad at valkhana in my speedrun:hmmmmmmmm this just made safijiva look adorable
Majority of MH fans: OMG FATALIS IS COMING TO ICEBORN! Me & other MR 999 hunters: *curious Saitama face* hmmm? Huh, maybe you can show me a challenge.
everybody scream 😱😱😱😱 veteran : wait till it's come to crimson and white 🤣
My second favorite Monster, I hope they put Amatsumagatsuchi from Mhp3rd it's perfect
First time going to fight the original black dragon now im hyped and scared YEEESSSS
And what about the white and the crimson versions? 🤔
I lowkey just wanna see NPC hunters die in front of you and then Fatalis just melts them into its body
Still kinda sad all bowgun players gotta do is shoot him until he’s dead
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS TONGUE
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS TONGUE
“We’re all in this together”
FREEDOM UNITE BOIS WHERE YOU AT??
Welp, im getting monster hunter world.
I have PTSD after I saw this
Final update ;-; there goes my dreams of them adding a silly Kula Ya Ku Sub or Variant.  Jk, I'm actually really really excited for this.
Fatalis: it was lovely to have you this year see you next year or not ahahahaha.
I'm gonna miss my poog and kitty the most
i know why this is the final dev diary update... because the name of the fleet is Fivers and monster hunter world is technically monster hunter 5 and this is 5th free title update.. get it? clever capcom lol. also, since we are going back to the old world to fight Fatalis, does this mean the next monster hunter game will take place in the old world?
Run for your lives!!! And I'm a veteran!!
Gives me shivers
The final stand of the fifth fleet
Well... Gentlemen, it was an honor.
Dread it...run from it... destiny still arrives.
Who is the voice actor for the general? He voice sounds so familiar but I cannot put my finger on it
If the music is done by a orchestra, you know it's a good fight.
thats siiiick for people that still play the game
Man, I need to get my butt moving, because I have a feeling that we have to defeat Alatreaon before we can fight Fatalis. I haven't even got through the Safi'jiiva recon quest. Then again, it would make sense because of what the Third Fleet Master had said after you beat Alatreon. Never played the previous MH games, but I hope they will do Fatalis justice in October update.
One more time, for old times sake...
rip ace cadet
Death comes for all, best to give it a run for its money, ah?
"We'll buy everyone some time to eacape" - continues to cart 3 times
FATALIS M BOI IS 28TH ON TRENDING!!!!
yall are dead  im dead everyone is dead!
Part of me is excited, part of me is worried. I want fatalis to come but I also don't want another nova.
15 years later i will fight again with fatalis
It’s been a hell of a run with this game ever since I first got it, I’ll be kinda sad when they’re done with this game but it’ll sure serve as a great memory. GG Iceborne. 😊
That castle and that music give me immense Dragon's Dogma vibes. (Although I suppose that makes sense, since Dragon's Dogma is also a Capcom title.)
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k future
A black person in the trailer let’s go
Fade to Black “The Black Dragon of Legend is no longer just a Legend. Make use of what you find within the castle and you might stand a chance. The fate of our nation lies in your hands!” Remember hunters, the arena will be full of advantages to use against The Fatalis, use em and you might survive. And remember, have fun!
So is this mhw's last update, or iceborne's last update?
When I saw the Alatreon trailer, I told everyone to synchronize their death watches.   Now that I see this, I say throw away those stupid death watches, death is already at your doorstep.
Whos the voice actor for the new character? He sounds so familiar
White and Red when
That theme gives me chills.
Ok im gonna continue fishing then. Good luck fellow hunters.
ONLY People who didn’t come from *Tiktok* are worthy of liking this
God im getting goosebumps over this..
God im getting goosebumps over this..
Love seeing Monster Hunter on Trending 😍
Jesus Christ  is coming back. He loves you dearly and calls for you to come back home to Him.  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  He calls for repentance and belief in the Gospel. It’s time to fully surrender to Christ. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
does this mean they will nerf alatreon or will I have to delete my game and sell it?
YAS FATALIS THE ORIGINAL BLACK DRAGON!!!
Feel free to pray to god for mercy.  But spoilers: Fatalis won't be listening.
Watch the uncensored cut https://youtu.be/Lxas0P684d4
I have chills. From excitement or fear?? I do not know.
The title to me: Excitable A-lister fucking dies.
"To the Early Squad That's reading this"  Sending Virtual hugs to anyone who needs it! Stay safe everyone and positive  My dream is trying to reach 10k to make my mum and dad proud.  Can't wait to reach that goal and do that special challenge
Now i fight for the kingdom of katolis, ALL HAIL KING EZRAN!
And to think some people said that ruiner nergigante is fatalis level 🤣🤣
*Laughs in Lance*
Can the handler die in this one for the love of God
CAPCOM :  Presents the Fatalis Young Hunters : Mmm not bad Very old hunters : **TRIGGERED** HBG Cluster spam : HEHE BOI Nergigante : He left the game    Damn,  I waited  this moment on Playstation since I was 12 years and they turned off the servers of MH1
When the world is full of wyverns The legend is revived Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched. And blood is sucked up dry He burns the earth  And melts through iron He boils the rivers And mows down trees He awakens the winds And lights an inferno He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction Call for help Run for your lives And don't forget to Pray to the skies He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours Fatalis, Fatalis..........  Heaven and Earth are yours...............
Holy swear word... wow
Omg I came on my thigh😂😂😂😂
Me: Sees Black Legend Also Me: Omg a black guy with dreads pops up... Me knowing they are talking about fatalis: Oh my god a black dude without straight hair
Anyone who thinks The Fatalis should be nerfed, should go back to playing fortnite.  This is a dragon that melts hunters into its body showing them who the true hunter is. This Dragon has nearly ended humanity once, leaving only a few survivors.  This Dragon was meant to be hard, don’t nerf Fatalis.
He's back.....and he wants his hot fish
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MAN?!
Nice movie 👌👍🙏
Omg a dragon
i hope this will be a fight you can do singeplayer like alatreon and not a hub quest, because forcing you to play with random idiots is always a bad thing
This will be the begin of the end of every hunter career...
YOOOOOOOOOOO HYPE
I wonder if Capcom will sneak in a "hot fish" joke
...So, could Nergigante take him on?

U YES YOU WHO READ THIS COMMENT. I DON'T KNOW U, BUT I PRAY 4 YOU 2 FIND PEACE AND JOY IN YOUR LIFE
Are they hinting at dragon dogma 2...
To all the hunters who were angry about the difficulty of Alatreon..  Capcom isn't listening. Prepare to face a wrath far worse than Alatreon.
I have no fear againt any monster in Monster Hunter series but that thing it scares me  .   Especially the white one
That. Damn. MUSIC. HOOO BOY.
It's hammer time.
Please capcom for the next game we need white fatalis with the awesome hot fisch soundtrack
In a series filled with unique monsters, it’s a bit ironic the final boss is a fire breathing dragon.
My favourite boi is back!!! On October too I see ;)
With the Shield Jewel 2 now craftable.  I have an extra confident to fight this calamity.  Pierce it from neck to to tail 😁
When Fatalis is too epic that he don't need to come to the new world, the new world comes to him
JUST WHAT WE NEEDED !
Ah shit! Here we go again. And this is the last.
Fatalis: Mega fire breath Frontier Fatalis trio: Oh? Youre approaching me?
refreshing seeing an ACTUAL dragon :D movies/shows and games these days are obsessed with Wyverns, but still call them Dragons XD
French animehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi_w5bEu3qk
I want to do a new monster hunter on PS5 !!
Valtrax???? No
Fatalis: *Enters Iceborne*  New World Hunters: ItS jUsT a ClAsSiC dRaGoN Veteran Hunters: Vietnam Flashbacks (Fatalis Flashbacks)
TDS better kill this thing with boomerangs again!
Fucking FINALLY ITS BEEN A DECADE!
Ooooohhh Myyy Gooooshh!
This trailer is 10/10 i could really feel the destruction that the fatalis will lay upon the world. I can feel the fear from the characters and the ultimate challenge for the sapphire star as their only hope. This is not just a hunt anymore. This is a battle for survival
Fun fact: Fatalis never come to the new world we're going back to the old world
Bet it’s not harder the extreme behemoth
Anyone realize the few notes of this 0:10 music is from Kokoto village music?!
What if they set us up here. We fight Fatalis, beat him, but he survives. So they‘ll use this as a foundation for the next game where we fight crimson fatalis, who is this surviving Fatalis enraged after his defeat, following the lore of crimson Fatalis.
Eh, its just normal fatalis... Gimme the heavenly White Fatalis!!
i've got a theory for this : Imagine if this fatalis is indeed an old Fatalis hunter who was possessed by his fatalis armor ? It would be neat right ??
so....               Who wants to do the misheard lyrics for Fatalis's new theme?
then mh world is going to the end
ミラボレアス😵
New world hunter prepare everything as if this will be your last stand Old world hunter get ready to face the same terror once more :v
*and i dont even have Iceborne yet. and this game boutta last update*
In a different timeline there’s a deviljoh trying to eat fatalis
Does the handler finally die
Ok Ace cadet, don't screw this up! The Black Dragon to end all Black Dragons, way to end this amazing expansion, Capcom!
Trending above COD, I’m proud Fatalis
I need it's Theme the new one of course
Now that all the monsters in monster hunter world are out, CAPCOM should definitely make a monster size comparison
Hey hey, its okay if its the last free update  But please just release another paid update Capcom 😩
Here’s me hoping Capcom actually put Fatalis behind a reasonable MR cap instead of 24 again, at least make the cap 100 so inexperienced hunters 24 and below don’t complain that the monster that is clearly above their current skill level is too hard
Fatalis, Fatalis, Heaven and Earth are yours
Every other monster in MHW: Looks awesome, can't wait to fight this! Fatalis: Oh fuck I'm out, time to retire!
Thank you
Can't wait to see a backlash from the players who couldn't even beat Alatreon easily.
Holy Shit he's back
0:17 I hope this won't be used as an excuse to have the fight drop random weapons like kulve.
“Weapons from its last stand are still on sight” “They knew the stakes, they battled hard, but were ultimately *outmatched*.”  Our last selves never made it. They never did. That’s, horrifying.
Hopefully, the minimum requirements for this mission are to reach at least MR 200 above, and low rank is not allowed like MR24. Because most people of low rank they continue to die and die die die or they love to die idk ☹️
The OG Final Boss. The original Black Dragon. *THE* most dangerous Elder Dragon in Monster Hunter.
At first, it be like, "Hooray, Fatalis is here!" But then, once everyone realize what's going on, it be all, "Oh no, Fatalis is here!"
when we have to fight this thing knowing I have to fight it alone and Fatalis just flies up to me glowing eyes ready to kill me and my only thought is:     "Oh Fuck me"
Capcom to Fatalis: "Happy Hunting!" Capcom to Hunters: "Happy Screaming!"
It is called Miraboleas in Japan.
Literally to the 1% who’s reading this God Bless you stay safe and have a wonderful day❤️my dream is to become a famous YouTuber
Idk if he die or not, but in the 0:45 where he pushed you out of the flame.
General: Hunter's. Your attention Me: *You have all my attention Sir*
Will i be able to fight him if i dont have the icebourn dlc
Yay! Behemoth 2!!
thank you capcom
Is this a seige? Cause I hope to god it's not
I haven't beaten Alatreon yet and this guy just shows up? XD Edit: Hope its just a straight up fight unlike Alatreon.
I bet an Arch-Tempered Nergigante is going to burst into Castle Schrade and finish off Fatalis for us, promptly T-posing and flying away with his kill   Edit: yes, this is a joke, though I have a feeling an actual Nergi fanboy will back me up at some point
Where all f*cked
I want to point out to everyone that they have also given us a DRAGONATOR for this fight! And no that isn’t me saying that it’s gonna be easy. What I’m saying is that the developers either are feeling super confident or they pity us
“So what we’re up against isn’t a monster, it’s actually history.”  Yeah, and we’re about to become history.
I think that excitable A-listers dad was possessed by the fatalis armor
The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown
D:
Ah yes another day of *"YOU'VE FAINTED"*
https://youtu.be/W9h8PGuFWtE
Next : Ukanlos why? bruh its iceborne
That's not TROGDOR!
WAKE UP! The Tribulations are coming very soon! Jesus will be returning near the end of the tribulations! Repent now! Turn away from your sins and follow Jesus Christ who died for your sins! All the world events have been prophesied, they have been predicted in the Bible and are happening right now! Storms, earthquakes, flooding, fires, locusts, asteroids, and rioting (lawlessness/sin). Many nations are going to form an alliance and attack Israel. There are going to be famines and tons of extreme destructive weather and sickness. The world is going to follow the New World Order in which everyone is united under one government and it will be an evil one. They will pretend to be peaceful and loving, but when the time comes they will tear the world apart and start killing everyone. "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. (Matthew 24:7 King James Version)" "And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. (Luke 21:11 King James Version)" "And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke (Joel 2:30 King James Version)" . You are all sinners, just like me! You are wicked and live in lies! Repent now or you will be thrown into the pit of fire! The wages of sin are death! "23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23 King James Version) Here is the good news! You can be saved, and taken out of the world before this time comes and be with Jesus Christ! "16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16 King James Version)" "15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: (1 Corinthians 15:1-4 King James Version)" . ABC's of Salvation (How to be Saved): "9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Romans 10:9-10 King James Version)" Admit you're a sinner and that you need to be saved and forgiven, and that you can't enter into Heaven by your own works but by Jesus Christ. Believe in Jesus Christ truly with all your heart and that He died on the cross for your sins, and rose on the third day. Commit/Call to God with all of your heart, and pray to God. Ask for forgiveness and to be given the gift of salvation and to be sealed by the Holy Spirit. REPENT! . Then continue to walk in His light, and hold His hand and let Him guide you through life and protect you. No one can take you out of His hand. "28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.  29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.  30 I and my Father are one. (John 10:28-30 King James Version)" . "40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. (John 6:40 King James Version)" . Thanks be to God forever and ever! Glory be to God forever and ever! God bless you! God bless President Trump! Amen.
I can't kill Alatreon and now this.. Solo hunting is really difficult to survive.. UwU
Anyone getting those flash backs of getting nuked by Fatalis?
Bloody 'ell
So... who’s betting that we’re to see Arch-Tempered Fatalis next year?
is the excitable a lister gonna die!? kinda looks like it...       can I have his handler pls
Why am I not surprised that people who haven't bought Iceborne yet again aren't getting anything new.
0:44 imagine that's only him sneezing. I mean literally that's how Fatalis sneeze. He obliterate the whole castle by just sneezing.
Hunters: MAN THE CANNONS, READY THE DRAGONATOR, THIS IS THE FIGHT OF OUR LIVES!!!  Fatalis: *haha arena go boom boom*
i still haven’t killed alatreon lmao
Safijiva should play a part in this. It would be awesome to see Safi come out of nowhere and sapphire star.
Damn... if I’m having trouble with alatreon, I don’t wanna imagine Fatalis...
If acnelogia in fairytale can become official collaboration monster like behemoth in FF lore it would be like akantor with wings and meets this black dragon fatalis it will become clash causing unimaginable disaster that never seen😮
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
This is the last free update of MHW right? RIP my chances to get Dalamadur. Fatalis is cool and all, even Crimson and White, but I'd rather the series ended on the colossal scale of Dalamadur (since his skeleton is already in MHW as the Rotten Vale bone track.)
Oh dear god...  In time...  You will know what it’s like to lose...  To feel so desperately that you’re right...  Yet to fail all the same...  Dread him. Run from him...  Fatalis still arrives.   Your deaths...will put a smile on his face
So should I just bend over now to save time...
Hmm looks like Crimson and White will be coming in the future
Those who wear the armour of fatalis, a curse will befall onto you, the armour will cause you to go insane while it merge with you. Once that hunter loses his humanity and fuse with the armour, a new fatalis shall be born. This is the curse of the black dragon.
If you guys ever fight him in the older gen like MH1, i hope they change the "Objective Complete" textbox to "You Win the Battle", just like in the old gen. But i dont think such small thing will happen.
*Day 15 after the update* No one: Speedrunners: dO yOu WaNt tO sEe mE wHOoP iTs aSs iN 7 miNuTEs?
My birthday is the 1st! I don't know if I've ever been more simultaneously excited and scared of a birthday gift before!
If one of the Arch Tempered monsters has the General's armor as the layered I'll be happy
RIP Here lies the ashes of a hunter and cat.
0:50 i heard something jiva , might just be a coincidence though
Simply epic
finally a REAL black dragon
He hath returneth  An he shall bring death upon thee
Now is the chance to show what Fatalis can do, I truly hope they re worked him to live up to the hype his name brings
Ah yes, my favorite version of Monster Hunter  *DARK SOULS EDITION*
I do hope that they'll include the original MH theme after  firing the dragonator  I bet that would be lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
*happy screeching*
This is cool and all, but where’s Arch Tempered Dodogama?
Any contact with female is the dystopian/shambles road to babies guys.Be careful of the Subliminal man-woman msg and thank goodness for animal kingdom to annihilate the latter. Andrew Jackson 2ne greatest president(behind Lincoln)? only one to return banks from shadowy organizations to American hands? Mystery science theater 3000 new seasons released : Truly extraordinary my Moonrakers of this achievement of men.   All comedy is sucked away by 51% of the world's population whose goal is replication of humans, not creativity, want to disintegrate dreams of the 49% and are an enemy of all creative arts including animation. Need to be herded in correctional facilities to figure out how to deal with these actual walking viruses. Spy/secret agents need to reevaluate their focus and annihilate. Need to get torn up by animal kingdom. Movies with humans have the hero and girl trying to get with each other. They even include animals assuming human characteristics of that man-woman nonsense. Be careful of what gets brainwashed into your subconscious from this. Watch out for hole guys. The romance angle (romance(tm) is too much a term for this) is handled charmingly/cutesy but all of this is like aw man here we go with this stuff. I know this movie spiderman ffh is showing guidance to males how to deal with females. All imagination shown in this movie, creativity is the male ability, while females are replication of humans (aka babies) so both goals are contrasts with each other and know if you stick it in their hole your creativity goes swoosh disintegrates, you fall inline with patriarchy which is uncompromising. Replication is them celebrating the debauchery of humankind while creativity is trying to get closer to God (creating imaginative things.) Any contact with female is the road to babies guys. Even the cutesy way movie dalliances are portrayed. I cant provide all the know-how on the matter, what I can state here that someone else hasn't figured throughout the thousands of yrs of human knowledge. They want to grind up men but it is I who grind them into fine dust. Wear pink to take their power away? I get it's hormones, just j/o in toilet or napkin. Also virtually all pawrn skyanks have baby shyts they keep secret from clients/viewers to upkeep pristine fantasy. Nintendo Mother/Earthbound textbook to be released wee- BApiano
Makes me wonder how many more monsters they plan on making. Or ones from previous games they wud add in
Me who hasnt even killed alatreon in over 100 attempts. Me finding this trailer in trending: holy fucking shit.......wait was that a black guy?!?! But pls i need help with alatreon, everyone that adds me just happens to get of for like a month not joking, my psn is Dtg9k
I've fought almost every monster in monster hunter, this is the one that terrifies me

Here comes the "hey guys can you help me beat Fatalis."
LET’S FUCKING GOOO!!!!! EXITABLE A LISTER WITH THE KUSHALA ARMOUR!!
Vet TIP: purple sharpness is shit on his tail... so use minds eye his weak to dragon.
Welp hunters it was a honor serving with yall.
anyone else's skin tingle while watching this?
Thank you!!
No fucking way no way no freaking way i was just thinking i hope thers some mh news soon and bam and freaking fatalis are you kidding me im pissing my self rn
When the world is full of wyverns  The legend is revived  Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched.  And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth  And melts through iron  He boils the rivers  And mows down trees  He awakens the winds  And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Call for help  Run for your lives  And don't forget to  Pray to the skies  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Fatalis, Fatalis  Heaven and Earth are yours  Fatalis, Fatalis  Heaven and Earth are yours
Well it's just another day in the Monster Road
Now fatalis?! 2020 must be really fcked up.
I'm new. What am I missing?
I hope it isn’t an event so I can play it offline whenever I want to since my internet is a bitch
Soloing it first try first fight 10 mins.
❤️❤️❤️❤️ the legendary fatalis is coming ready for bloody hunt
So, *The* Black Dragon returns..
want extreme behemoth 5.0 for this fatalis , no 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , the god damn 5.0 i want , if i see a fucking speed runner kill it in 5 minutes i will be so dissapointed ... i want the ultimate challenge since extreme behemoth we are missing that , alatreon wasn't that hard people get over it... get better gear learn mechanics... i want this Fatalis to abuse me so hard as extreme behemoth did, and hands up for the white fatalis would be amazing seeing that beauty in world...
Me: I beat all the Fatalis types in MHGU. With my hunting horn... Capcom: (Adds a 10 minute timer, one shot timer, forces multiplayer, and dps check.) Me: You know this is why no one likes you right?... Capcom: Adds achievement for using hunting horn on Fatalis. SUICIDAL TENDENCIES... Me: ... Well they are not wrong... 🎷 💀 🔥
Crystal generation "nerf pls" xD
Did they chant "Jiiva" at the end?
Is no one gonna talk about the wingdrakes still obey the hunters call to castle Schrade? Those things are fearless.
Hoping for White Fatalis xD
I've been waiting for this since world came out.
Capcom: "We're going to introduce the Fatalis to Monster Hunter World Me: Yes. Also me: The f**k took you so long?
You thought it was Valfak, but it was me, Fatalis!!!
Just a friendly reminder that there's still crimson and white Fatalis that's  waiting.
The hype is real
The return of the hot fish
Anyone remember the broken hitboxes from MHFU that made this fight super annoying to do? I am glad they fixed it in the newer games, being fucking one shotted by his shadow or invisible force apparently surrounding him was pure bullshit lol
Thor like voice: BRING ME FATALIS
Woah so beautiful
Bueno estamos el 28 de agosto
Hunters, ready up. This is gonna be one hell of a ride.
Day 1 is gonna be hell then after like a week he'll be a pushover like Alatreon.
This is every bit the beast Fatalos should be. Well done, Capcom.
Remember guys, Black Fatalis is the weakest incarnation of Fatalis. Enjoy
So they held crimson & white fatalis for the next monster hunter,i hope monster hunter switch fill the gap on the next monster hunter console, right now i playing mhgu while waiting fatalis update
Imagine the huntsman’s interaction with the fatalis.
Fivers: Oh no how will we ever beat him! Vets: Well you'll need 10,000 Zenny first.
I got an ostrich baked video recommended after i saw fatalist
Well hello old friend.
I’m scared for this but also hyped its been awhile
I need new pants.
Could you please make fatalis fire super deadly and instantly killed you
Here is the thing about Fatalis...  He has GREAT LORE....but nothing to back it. I am curious how this is now going to work now that we have a skilled Capcom team here
i wonder how many tds speedruns theyre going to have for this
Wow capcom , wow 👏👏
you hear that? that was the OG monster hunter community having a collective orgasm
The wait is finally over! HELL YES!!!
Guess were dying tonight, LET'S GET THIS PARTY GOING GANG.
We got a Bratha in there🤙🤙 nice😄😄 I’m pumped now
100% honest. The OG Fatalis fight does not live up to the legend BUT with how they treated Alatreon I am confident that this fight will do the legend justice.
Hello Darkness my old friend...
OH GOD PLEASE I NEED TO FIND A COMPROMISE WITH MY DOCTOR (big medical reasons) TO PLAY MY GAME AGAIN AND FIGHT FATALIS JUST PLEASE
THIS WILL BE THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT OMG
Y’all have no idea...how long I’ve wanted to fight him. I have played the very first monster hunter game, but I wasn’t able to fight due no Ethernet access. I played generations, but I got stopped dead due to various things. Now, at long last, I shall be able to face the god of all monsters!
ACTUALLY SCREAMING In excitement and also fear LOL I'm ready but not ready xD
me kicking my fiancé's door down at 1 in the morning to show him this: WILL HOLY FUCK
In case you're wondering, even if you somehow manage to emerge triumphant, you'll still lose because, eventually, the armor you forged from Fatalis's corpse will take you over and YOU will become the next Fatalis  Have fun!
pretty cool, but ill never get to fight it since i suck.
This is pretty cool!!!  What do you guys think should I pre order it?
Thanks for this last update Capcom.
Well fellow hunter's rest in piece.
Monster hunter title update 5: "Well it was a good run guys"
Hell yeah! An epic way to end.
To the real fans that are reading this  You're a very smart and adorable human Stay healthy during quarantine   My Goal is 1k not begging just asking.
The only monster I didn't want them to bring back.
I'm ready to die.... The end has come and I do not fear it.
Yeeeeees!!!!!!!
Cross play please
*We shall not die so quietly in the burning night.*
As solo veteran.. I remember old day. Only fatalis I still cannot beat it on mh2dos solo all creatures except him..
While they're hyping up this fight to be the ultimate endgame fight. Let's be honest though, a group of four is going to manage to sticky/pierce spam Fatalis to death in 2 mins in the first few days.
Welp ladies and gentlemen, we hunters will still hunt and drive them to extinction. We will all be soon reunited with the next Monster Hunter game. MAY THE SAPPHIRE STAR LIGHT OUR WAY
12 years later. We meet again.
it'd be awesome and horrifying if we witnessed it fuse a hunter to its body.
We? Bitch I'm doing this solo
Make space...! The best monster without a doubt is here!
Is this how I’m gonna die
Please no more multiplayer-only and instant-cart damage threshold nukes. That stuff is SUPER annoying.
Now I have to kill alateron
The OST is more epic than ever.
"Fate may be written in the stars, but it is our armor and our own merits that become us. The wyvern of legend stands before you. But fear not, for the hunters of old watch over you now. Stand proud, Hunter; this is your hour."  -"To Slay a Legend" quest description
Does fatalis kill him??? Excuse me wtf?????????????
Well hunters its been a honor to fight against bad hotboxes. Now we face the worst of all!
It’s been 10 fucking years
So whats next? Next gen game?
$AmorahAmani
He gives me the same feeling when I see King Ghidorah
hopefully instead of a OHKO dps check instead if they have a check maybe he gets powered up more and more until you can knock him out of a buffed state maybe using a dragonator. OHKO moves are getting old. (or better yet no dps check at all and just a good old fight)
so whats the 1 shot gona be thats the only question i have
MY BODY IS READY!!!
Rip I rlly wanted white fatalis the most actually but YEEEEESSSSSSSSS MY NUMBER 2 MOST WANTED MONSTER IN ICEBORNE
Fatalis was literally just chilling in castle schrade (or however you spell it) not bothering anybody, just wanting to be left alone.   then these dumb ass hunters come rolling up to the front gates like: “omg!! The most powerful creature to exist was seen here!!!! Let’s split up and look for clues gang!!”  Like they literally brought this upon themselves wtf 😂  ( or maybe I’m dumb and misinterpreted what’s gonna happen🤷‍♀️)
Awesome!    But please let it be a a normal hunt. No siege, and no MMO mechanics.    Just a difficult normal hunt.
Hoo boy, back to the Castle and dodging those hitboxes.  HYPE AF!!
I can barely handle Alatreon. Now there’s going to be a Xeno’jiiva sized god dragon around
Please no fucking raid mechanics or alatreon mechanics.
back for my 504th rewatch
Solo Hunter with Strong Gear, High Jewels, and Max Palico: *Teleports behind Fatalis* Fatalis: *Teleports behind Hunter* Also Fatalis: Everything Personal Kid. *Quest Failed*    Ruiner Nergigante and Pukei Pukei back at the New World: They should be fine... right?
Never fight Fatalis before but i heard story and i have goosebumps while watching the trailer.
john wolfe
A true challenge indeed.
Veterans: *gentlemen! sync your death watches!* Hopeful veterans and hopeful newbies: *Gentlemen, the time has come.*
0:45 Ace hunter fucking dies
BRUH
Is the shit denuvo gone yet?
And I thought Dark Souls and Monster Hunter were working together.
My old punching bag
White version someday?
He risked His live or died for Us :(
Capcom did well with this game. They deserve all the praise they get.
I'm just hoping that he won't be a multiplayer centered monster and that you're not forced to use something like mostly elements to kill him. Just you, your weapon, skill, and one pissed off dragon.
those facial graphics / animations....
There is actually a song about fatalis in MHFU if you read the books in the house
Behold the lord of hellfire.  A Dragon in every meaning of the word.  Malevolent, Cruel, and all too aware of what it is capable of.    This is not a being you can retreat from. Not a battle you can put off. Either it dies, or the guild dies.
It hits so hard you automatically cart twice if you get hit!
To all the fivers who started in world you are now marked as a veteran. Mark your title and claim the next generation!
Finally a worthy opponent! This battle will be legendary 3 Carts!
i can’t stop rewatching this
Oh my gosh lets fuckin  goooo
Honestly I kinda knew it would be some form of Fatalis, because of course it would Ngl I wish it was Dalamadur
Capcom for older games: We don't say anything about the black dragons on any media except in the game itself.  Capcom for MHW: Hunters, your attention.
WOW, ancient looking graphics.  Looks like a 2015 game at best.
Yall need to get good rn. yall better not take the faints or you can run the hands✊✊
i wonder if his body now get perma hardened when enraged/half battled like his 2 cousins were.
On the 0:40 mark looks like he's prepping up his OHKO move similar to Safi Jiiva's "Sapphire of the Emperor".
The coolest monster intro jeez
Speaking in-universe, there is no away anyone would make it out of this unscathed:  - If they lose, they die, their bodies are melted down by Fatalis and become coating for its hide. - If they escape and/or win, they're struck with horrific madness and PTSD that lasts until they die. Rarely does one escape Fatalis' wrath without losing their mind. - If they manage to avoid *THAT* twisted fate, wearing the beast's armor would turn the poor sod into another Fatalis, Corrosive Hannibal style.
THIS IS COMING ON MY *BIRTHDAY!?!?!*
I personally am not a big fan of this guy but he definitely is badass lore wise, and with this introduction. To me he's a average dragon besides lore and I wish this could've been Gore Magdala ;-;
https://youtu.be/Hzu9-payjPE
Just a wild theory but what if the A-lister's history with this Fatalis is that it's what became of our MH4U character after they defeated Fatalis and donned it's cursed armour
now im hopeful for lao shun as well
If the Ace Cadet dies I’m gonna go ape shit mad
"he doesn't look so tough" The words etched into my gravestone
By his death a new cycle begins... Oooh boy... Here we go again...
I've watched this trailer at least 50 times already       Edit: make that like 500
I CALLED IT. YAAAAAAASSSSSSS!!!!!! I GET TO KILL MORE FATALIS BUT ON MHW! CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY HUNTERS!!!
Nobody: Khezu: "It smells like btch in here"
Oh shit oh fuck, oh fuck oh no memories are coming back
yasssssssssssssss finally ive been waiting for this since i was like 10
DAMN! HE WAS THE ROAR IN THE ANCIENT FOREST!!!!
omg i will die so much now ;-;
well, i was having a bad day. it's not bad anymore.
My homie Excitable A-lister better not die.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I cant believe this right now
Press F for my boy Ace Cadet/excitable a-lister  He ded
Gg guys.
Apex Deviljho still worse.
Hammer main: "Hah! I'll just bonk em on the head like the rest!!"  Fatalis: *Stands up on two feet  Hammer: "NANI!?"
YOOOOOOO
Can't wait to listen to this theme all day everyday
I think i just shit myself
I got FUCKING goosebumps and a stroke watching this
Dread it... run from it... the black dragon always Arrives
THE END IS HERE..... THE END IS NEAR......... THE END IS HERE!!!!!!!! MHW developers are doing something....... The Hunter's will regret! THE......END.......IS.......HERE ⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️👹👺
Didn’t this game die a week after it came out?
This will be my first time hunting him and I’ll say that my body is ready for the anal probing that I’ll be receiving from him 😁😁😁😁
A great finally, To a great game!
outbuilding obligations
All amazing things sadly must come to an end and I wouldn't have it end any other way.
insane
I wonder if they’ll only add fatalis, or white fatalis as well. If not I understand but damn do I want white fatalis
Fatalis, Fatalis, Heaven and Earth are yours.
At last, you're finally coming to Iceborne. I've been training for this moment, My first battle against the black dragon Fatalis. I don't care how many times I must try, but you are going down.
marvel   ?
can i solo this dude?
What does this mean for our old MHFU character who fought it long ago?
but the main question is where is my dragonater?
Were all gonna die!
Welcome to the most dangerous monster in all of history   Watch out for his long tail hitting you as he turns around; it’s his most dangerous attack
...and that puts a smile on my face...  Fatalis...  It's time to settle things.
Good thing the ace hunter got evasion +3
Thank u Capcom for my bday present😅
Man 2020 has no chills..
YES THE TIME HAS COME
The people who complained that Alatreon was hard are gonna have a good time with this one
Wtf are people arguing about whether he's easy or not. Each weapon has different play styles and when you consider differences between players some bosses will be easier then others for some people.i'm just looking forwatd to the return of everyone's worst friend
when i see altareon i am happy but it didnt make me come back to the game now fatalis thats a different story i am really hype for this battle
It's here...
Given the two areas shown, I imagine we'll be able to drop the gate on him like we could in the original.  I also hope we can explore Schrade more now that it's been turned into a "World" map. Maybe just be able to go a little bit deeper into it rather than just being stuck in the battle ground.
What about the white old man?
Guess I better dust off my ps2 and go back in time 15 years. I'll need the help of my original hunter to shake the rust off my set. So many good times from Fatalis equipment, from headlocking Rathlos to pushing back Lao-Shan Lung past his starting point and killing him where I couldn't carve.
Fatalis igniting the whole castle with one fire breath, the big boss is finally showing it's firepower
God dammit Capcom lemme play other games.
BEHOLD YOU UNREPENTANT NEW WORLDERS!!! THIS IS ABSOLUTE TRUTH!!! THIS IS SALVATIO-*SPLAT!!!*
I prefer White Fatalis and Crimson though but OKAY
Ah the good ol psp days are coming back.
I wish Fatalis eat the handler
I love that fatalis is back and ready to turn us all to ash but does anyone else want to wear the general’s cape?
I have never been more excited for an update to a game
I just hope it won't have an annoying gimmick like Alatreon... I don't want to seem them ruin Fatalis too.
Question... will it be a siege quest also?
Nergi hate vs fatalis hate .... dragon fight (food and drinks)
Please tell me there are no damage checks in this one. Eschaton Judgment is frustrating enough.
Our final fight will be our funniest fight
Hunters: We have you four to one  Fatalis: I like those odds
So, because this is a game, it can’t truly show off Fatalis power. A group of 4 or even the commission couldn’t handle him lorewise. It would take every hunter from the entire guild from all over the world who can lift a weapon to stop him. It’s said that Fatalis can scorch the planet with its fire in just a few days...
October 1st: The End Of The Monster Hunter World!  Me: Awesome!
Alatreon:haha i am the most fearsome monster ever Fatalis:hello there  Alatreon has left the new world
Who the hell dislikes videos like these
And gore magala?
White and crimson still waiting :3
YESSSS
O   M   G
it´s been 10 years since we fought each other my old friend. i hope our battle will be a legendary, just like the old times.
The A-lister gotta be dead right
I hope every attack is a one shot 😍
Todos nosotros sin excepcion de uno hemos pecado contra Dios y la paga del pecado es la muerte pero el regalo de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesus.  Dios envio a su Hijo unigenito Jesus al mundo a salvarnos de nuestros pecados.  El vivio sin pecado y murio como si fuese un pecador.  Jesus murio crucificado y luego resucito al tercer dia por nuestros pecados para asi justificarnos delante de Dios y reconciliarnos con Dios.  Asi mismo les ruego a ustedes, reconciliense hoy con Dios y arrepientanse de sus pecados y pongan su fe en Jesus, y apartense del pecado. JESUS VUELVE PRONTO!
So it begins again
I might have started with the new World games in the main series, but I know of Fatalis and I love to see what they did to it in the World incarnation and if we might have secretly sneaked in more than just one Monster(hinting towards Crimson and White fatalis).
Key word they was ultimately out match   And please THE A LISTER CAN'T DIE ON ME  he is my favorite character
You know its going to be serious, when the ace cadet changed his weapon from an SnS to HBG
Most people see him as boring... that was because they nerfed him in the 4th generation. Now Capcom shall do the opposite.
I am happy he’s getting reworked and making him more difficult than what he used to be now his title fits more perfectly
I bet Nergigante not gonna throw hands with Fatalis lol
I CALLED IT
As long as he doesnt have a bullshit instakill mechanic like alatreon. And just a straight on fight I'll be happy
Never got to fight fatalis in previous games. So i can't wait to see what he can do!!!
1. We kill another black dragon. 2. Safi sucks the latent power from the carcass. 3. We’ve played into Safi’s plans and awaken its next evolution. 4. Commission (Community) name and fight Ultra-Safi-Prime-AT^2-Omega-Deluxe.  5. Get carted.
We supposed to kill it? Feel like it could be a repel lol
this is about Halloween 🎃
Oh shit
When the world is full of wyverns  The legend is revived  Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched.  And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth  And melts through iron  He boils the rivers  And mows down trees  He awakens the winds  And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis   The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Call for help  Run for your lives  And don't forget to  Pray to the skies  He is called Fatalis   The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis   The wyvern of destruction  Fatalis, Fatalis  Heaven and Earth are yours  Fatalis, Fatalis  Heaven and Earth are yours   -excerpt from a book in one of the freedom games.   This is a tune sung by children, as they are said to have a feeling when calamity approaches.  And before you start, I know he’s a dragon, you know he’s a dragon, it’s the poem that says wyvern.
Fatals in freedom unite is so hard
Finally, BIGGER WINGS!
what a journey its been these 2 years. thank you for creating a very unforgettable experience!
I cant wait for this, holy hell I hope his armor is literal kino.
Wake me up when September ends. This will be a hard wait.
Yo but I haven't even beat Alatreon yet how I'm supposed to beat this one?
Ah yes he finally arrives
They've allowed us to challenge Altereon it was only a matter of time, we may not be ready but I will be prepared. Who dares to jump into the burning flames with me WHO?!?
He protecc He attacc And once it breathes on you. You aint  coming bacc.
let me guess.. twice as much health as alatreon, one shot mechanic, and broken hitboxes with one shot mechanic
Finally, the real title update this month, the true legendary Black Dragon        OBAMA
0:30 “Dread it... Run from it... Destiny arrives all the same...”  Oh how the music bi*tch slaps Alatreon and Safi’jiva out of existence...
Creepy fact Legends say that hunters who failed to defeat him were melted by his flames and adorned on his hide so those scales are actually smelted dead hunter
Today is a good day to die...
And here comes the war between people who think Fatalis can beat Safi.
DUUUUUUUDE!!! I missed the Alatreon because i didnt have internet over break, but this looks freaking awesome! As someone who started with 3 Tri, it'll be nice to finally fight Fatalis!
Ah SHIT HERE WE GO AGAIN
Death has come for us all.
Ah yes cant wait to fight the dragon from shrek again
Holy shit this is hype
Oh boi hope ya'll ready for an arbitrary gimmick that will wipe the entire party!
I've realised something. Now that Fatalis is in...that means that all the flagships are in world or were planned for world...except 99% of the fourth generation flagships. The ONLY one we have is Glavenus. Interesting...very interesting
I've never fought a Fatalis... But at 0:32 when the music started up and Fatalis roared, that gave me major goosebumps.  I know the lore of how Fatalis literally almost wiped out civilization, but... Is he as hard of a fight as you'd expect gameplay-wise? I think it's cool they're adding another monster and all but I don't know if I want a repeat of the Alatreon shenanigans.
MH World Players: IT'S FATALISSSSS!  MHGU Players: First time?
blangonga para cuando
Wasn't original Fatalis a lady, whose appearance caused Lao Shan Lung to flee for is life?
Question, is that the same Schrade from the old games? Or is it a different castle
I'm not all that impressed. Fatalis will either pull an Alatreon and get some artificial difficulty, or it'll stay the same just with nicer animations. Plus, I thought world was all about the New World, why are we back here?
Never played the previous games but i hope i can join the party lol
THE KING!!!  HAS COME!!   AT LEAST!!!!!
I hope we can fight this one however we want
Well boys looks like we’re heading home.
As Hunters, we've slowly been climbing up the ecosystem. Each hunt completed, the scars we've gained and the experience learned has helped mold us into the Apex Predators we are now. As humans, we're the ultimate form of beings able to adapt to any situation and now we're close to the top of the food chain. Now we have one last challenge. The ultimate test and every Hunters aspiration and dream: To slay a Fatalis. The dragon that is the Apex of Apex Predators. The dragon that literally sows fear into all of creation. It's time to show Fatalis that it's been mistaken about being the ultimate Apex Predator.
Fatalis: you could not live with your own failure. What did that bring you. Back to me.
Fatalis??  Bitch, I'm still stuck on Alatreon!
They better not ruin this fight with a shitty gimmick
omfg gooosebumps af hell yessssss finallyyyy hyype
Easy 2 min 50 speedrun
This is all Sa'fi Jiva's fault.
Veteran hunters. We're in the endgame now.
I knew it! I knew they would bring him in! Alatreon will be a pansy compared to this thing! :O
Waiting for the change.org petitions from casuals
All the dislikes are from the people that fear him lol
Here's a question...what's the connection between Fatalis and Alatreon? They're both black dragons but Fatalis seems to be in a completely different league than even Alatreon...
Good
i can't wait to see how team darkside make it their bit*h
* excited intensified *
I hope he doesn’t have a move like escaton judgement because I just want to enjoy him
Fatalis: I have returned mortals, fear me Plesioth: Hold my beer
To anyone saying he's going to be easy, look at what they did to Alatreon. Now imagine what they will do to THE black dragon himself
*OTHER* *MONSTERS* *CANT* *BEAT* *HUNTER*  FATALIS: Fine I will do it myself
YYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS! LET THE CARTING BEGIN!!!!!
We meet again... after 16 years... Who else fought this bastard back in 2004?
"What we're up against isn't a monster...it's actually history" Me:yeh it does, a history About i got carted,fainted, with this monster
I never been so hyped and scared in me whole life. I think this might be the most bad ass ending for mhw ever. And that theme 😍😮
Its gonna be a siege. Im pretty sure of it
I don't want the ace cadet to die😥
Please dont make like alatreon and another absurd supernova!!!
The black dragon (Fatalis) vs The red dragon (Me). JUST LIKE ALATREON, ILL CONQUER HIM SOLO
the last diary?
Dude that's fucking awesome!!! Capcom you are amazing!
I still haven't killed safi
Did the A-lister just...die?
Gaahhh... I still have PTSD from the last time...
White Fatalis is still the most awe-inspiring monster ever, but this might give it a fair run for its money
Gentlemen... Synchronize your death watches!
The whole video summed up in one word: Death.
Just the fact That we are fighting him. At the Castle and his music is makeing this trailer Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
F for the red head hunter
Dang. I wanted Dalamandur
One last slam
They’re recruiting felynes in the Old World because the Commission doesn’t have enough cart haulers for this
So this implies that Fatalis beat the Hunters from the first game?
Please don't turn this onto another siege guys. Let this monster roam freely as it should on that castle map. And please male it a nice big new map to hunt other monsters on. That would be so awesome.
Make it as hard as possible please. And maybe, just maybe... A reveal on the mysterious and equally controversial, The Equal Dragon Weapon. Ah how I've waited this moment since the original MH
¡¡¡¡THE BLACK DRAGON HAS RETURN!!!, THE END HAS COME!!!! 😱😱😱😭😭😭
I'd do anything for them to have never spoken English.
Notes for newbies:Fatalis is like Alatreon but bigger and he has two other forms/subspecies.
We weren't ready for Arch temper the Greatest Jagras, so they settled with giving us a black dragon
OHHHHHHH ITS THE BLACK DUDE THINNS GETTING SERIOUS
Coming out of retirement
To the old hunters, I raise my mug to you all for one last rally. To the new hunters, people will sing songs of our victories as the sapphire stars who lit the path for the next generation.
Whenever a hunter faints on fatalis they should be auto booted from the quest and a dark souls You Died message should appear.
Alatreon: “I’m gonna force you to use suboptimal weapons to win”  Fatalis: “go back to the OP gear, you’re gonna need it”
Newbies: cool! new monster this will be a piece of cake!     Veterans: HUNTERS! TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!
If excitable A-lister dies saving us I'll cry, I actually like him. Cause unless he got one hell of a fireproof mantle equipping game he did not make it out of that fire after pushing us
And so it begins.... Hunters, sharpen your blades and steel your resolve.  If you believe in any gods.....do not pray to them, for they will not save you now.
It's no monster, it's a God!
Are they gonna add white one and the dark one
The bell tolls, the world has run dry of torment, the meek weep, and the wheels of fate turn upon the A list hunter, god is coming and he is out of mercy....
Whether we are noobs or veterans we are all the same. We are hunters. I wish you all the best of luck.
As Emperor Kuzco said: Bring it on.
Hell yes!
It has been an honor gentleman...may God have mercy on our souls...
I'm sad that we didn't get Gore or Valstrax(among many). Yet at the same time it's Fatalis so I'm happy at the same time. He deserves to be the last boss, the only other fitting end would be Safi Jiiva becoming a new Black Dragon.
This cool but... now here me out... you could just make Dragons dogma 2
May the Sapphire Star light our darkest hour.
I see they're killing off the excitable A-Lister so we can have his handler
se chingo al almirante el fatalis no manches
It all comes full circle, I still remember the first time I fight this overgrown lizard 15 or so years ago and now here we are  Proud of you Monster Hunter community and Capcom team for making this franchise, definitely one of my fav ever
I can only hope there is another game coming soon. Playing the old games I always knew there was more coming but now I don't know. Hopefully they keep the servers up for a few more years. Or offer LAN at least... so multiplayer doesn't die. It was a pleasure hunting with you all :(
people who can't beat the alatreaon: uHh ThIs gAmE iS tOo hArD.. Fatalist: oh no, i'm sorry for my little cousin do to you
New hunters: What's with the Dark Souls dragon? Vets: Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit
They better not kill my boi the ace cadet.
Dude, this fight better not be easy like the Alatreon fight. This better be a challenge.
So like hopefully he one-shots to live up to the hype
The wings of death even gods fear. Any mortal who challenges the black dragon only end up as another snack.
00:41  MAKE IT A POSTER PLEASE OR ANYTHIIIING....THAT WAS SO COOL!
This fight shall be legend fellas
Newbs:Yoooo! This is sick! Veterans:*Takes out water canister and starts drinking with trembling hands while war flashback meme starts playing in the background*
oooooooh aaaaaaaah waaaaaaaaaaaa . . . will be my exact reaction when i die
I just started this game, and it gives me the monster I/we dreaded fighting in 4U and beyond? Oh, boy.
Massive Dragon's Dogma vibes here
We knew the path we were walking. Now it's time we see this through to its end. Hunters, it has been an honor.
We had a long run boys, but we are finally at the end game. Its been a honor hunting with you all.
My only hope with this is NO DPS CHECK! I'm fine if we have no place to go get back our items, but for the love of god, when the quest say the hunt is 50 minutes long, I want a 50 minute long plausible battle with no DPS check that just inst kill if I somehow can't meet it. If I want to do this solo and take however long time I can do it by myself, I want it to be a long, drawn out, bloody battle.
The excitable a Lister is right we are fighting history and those that this beast killed and melted for armor.  Remember that when you fight him.
If there is a dps check im not fighting him.
Fun fact: it is said that Fatalis smelts the hunters it defeats and puts them over his scales as armor. Just a little lore of how legendary this Elder is.
Fireball me Daddy
I still hear the sounds of my weapon bouncing
Shouldn't his horns be asymetrical tho ?
Fatalis: I'm Back Bois TO BREAK BONES AND DRINK BLOOD! FATALIS THE BLACK DRAGON HAS ARRIVED Me and My Homies:Welcome Back Fatalis! OUR BATTLE WILL BE LEGENDARY!
Here we go again!
All hunters get ours  weapons our potions,builds this is the return of the legendary dragon
Better not have any DPS checks :/
Someone is going to find a way to hunt it in under 5 minutes 😂
How can you show me this without his epic scream.
No te voy a mentir, me puso muy cachondo esto y a la vez es un karma, recuerdo unas semanas atrás cuando por fin domine a Alatreon y dije: Ja! Acabo de hacer mi perra al dragón mas molesto y dificil de destruir en este juego. Ni hablar, tengo vaselina lista porque si es igual o peor al fatalis que todos recordarnos, esto va estar duro.
Me: Finally beat alatreon. There is no way it can be harder than that. Me after this trailer: NOPE NOPE NOPE NOT DOING THAT
Only complain is the music is change a little. But l hope they will also add White Fatalis too, not sure if crimson Fatalis will make it.
Hunters...it has been an honor, I’ll see you all on the flipside👹🐲
Fatalis, the only monster that wears human armor to assert it's dominance
Fatalis Oh Fatalis! Yours is Heaven and Earth.  On another note. Alatreon which is hard AF was described as a fun fight by the devs. They said this will be very hard. Oof
So we gonna lose the A-lister?
"So no Valstrax?" *Throws phone* *Smashes great sword*
Dammit I haven’t even finished Iceborne I’m gonna miss the flood of people hunting him
Now that's a really good looking classic Dragon
Gentlemen, synchronize your death watches
Safi Jiiva: Nuke attack  Alatreon: Nuke attack  Fatalis: oh das cute
He badly needs a revamp, kinda boring in FU but hits like a truck. I really hope for a tough fight from fatalis, like really "keeps you on the edge at all times" kind of fight. That would be great.
Finally, my old friend... its been a while... since MHFU...
Does this mean that Xeno'Jiva/Safi'jiva's bio-energy didn't make Fatalis go to the New World or Fatalis just wants to stay in his domain??? And also the story of the Excitable A-Lister. Correct me if im wrong please.
I got the perfect set for this bastard. Bring it!
Man.... dark souls 4 looks lit
You couldn’t leave with you’re failure and where did that bring you right back to fatalis
ayoo wassup
Someone has already figured out the meta for soloing Fatalis. I’m sure of it.
Newbies: eh it’s just another monster, how hard can it be?  Veteran hunters with PTSD: BOI
Immortal through a undying grudge against humankind. So powerful all other creatures fall silent and flee in his wake. Ended the world in cleansing fire within just three days.   The King of All Monsters returns to assert his rule at last.
Then to find out Fatalis has some completely bull DPS check like Alatreon does now that shouldn't have been added to an otherwise great fight.  Will hold excitement till its out honestly, Alatreon was hype for me to then become an even worse Lunastra. Was hugely disappointing.
I can’t even respond
Me: Is that boss music? *Fatalis appears*  The squad: HIT IT TIL IT DIES  *Boss music intensifies* Fatalis: You dare approach me? Me: Aw shit here we go again.
Imagine if one day Capcom was all like "Here have a 2 headed crimson black Fatalis"
What about the USJ event though??  T_T
Reminder my fellow hunters that even the powerful black fatalis is a pawn of our lord and destroyer white fatalis
People that bitched about Alatreon are going to be super pissed.
this feels kinda odd to say, but I want to struggle to fight him, just like I did trying to solo behemoth back in high rank, because it feels SO GOOD to finally kill him and have that achievement
Ha ha ha we are in danger :)
Please just don't be another Siege with instakill DPS Check
Everyone I think pretty much dislikes the Ace Cadet/Ace A-Lister, but he's grown on me like he did with the Ace Commander in MH4, so seeing him push us away, I hope he doesn't get burned to a crisp, That would just be tragic
Oh shit
Great, more veteran hunters to overplay how difficult a monster actually is.
My final message: Goodbye, my dear fellow hunters and huntresses... there will be no one left after this
Well yes I’m im quitting the game goodbye
Such a Dark Souls vibe. Black Dragon, old castle, epic soundtrack.  Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
Thank god I was sitting on the toilet while watching this 😳💩
YES!! BOIS AND GALS, HES BACK!! The almaighty black dragon GOD OF MONSTER HUNTER!!! I knew it from the start and never stopped believing that he would be back... and there he is! And just look at Schloss Schrade! Dem GRAPHICS make it look soooo goood! But pls Capcom, pls. Dont give Fatalis the Alatreon treatment. Yes, we want a badass cool overpowered Black Dragon, GOD YES! But we also dont want you to turn him into the litteral DEVIL and make him immortal. So pls, make him the hardest challenge yet, but dont make him impossible. Its okay if it makes us rage, we can forgive him for that. But not if he is literally unbeatable and even Team Darkside gets demolished by him. So no Escatom judgement-like attack ok?
Wow I can see the comments already after Fatalis has hit us.  Its either " Fight is complete pushover. This thing is a joke, even Great Jagras is harder " if he doesn't get an update to catch up with monsters like Alatreon. Or its gonna be " WTF, what BS IS THIS FIGHT: ITS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE CAPCOm WHAT U SMOKING? NERF NERF NREF THIS FIGHT INSTANTLY OTHERWISE U GET BAD STEAM REVIEW" if the devs push Fatalis to the point where he finally lives up to his legendary status.   Well I hope its the latter case. I want this beast to be the top, I want him to be as dangerous as his lore tells us he is supposed to be and not the fucking joke he is in older games. And after we got Iceborn Alatreon, I'm certain that we will get one hell of a fight, perhaps even the best fight, if Capcom does it right. ( Its hard to top the Alatreon fight but Fatalis is the one monster who can top him )
Thanks CapCom for the Birthday present!
Seeing how earlier editions of Fatalis were underwhelming fights on the handheld. With far more powerful tech in the form of consoles they can do loads more with him. Fatalis needs to be represented here as the Black Dragon everyone fears.  For the last update and the slow hype building they have a bar of expectations to be met. I just want Fatalis to be given justice.
So whats gonna be his 1 shot mechanic?
Ps5 has arrived... BUT'''' KING(FATALIS)  HAS ARRIVED!!!
All things must come to an end, and that black dragon brings the end wherever it goes. https://youtu.be/rV6VbDzh4MU
Wow look a dragon. That's cool, valstrax would've been better but you know, a standard dragon is something I guess
The father of Elder Dragons is back baby! Tbh I was expecting MHFU Plesioth though
Yay I killed Alatreon, I should probably quit while I’m ahead
*Hunters: chilling* *Fatalis: Sup' fuckers!!!*
It's finally time to face fate head on. This is the single moment a lot of us "old world" hunters were wating for since the very first Monster Hunter World announce trailer. It's been quite a journey and I look forward to this legendary conclusion. I'll see you all at Castle Schrade.
This literally comes out on my birthday
Anyone know if there’s gonna be armour, it would be cool for a whole story about the fatalis armour encasing the hunter, but I think that would be too hard
Imma be saying one last "Shut up handler!"
I know this is supposed to be the final battle but can you PLEEZ add Crimson and White Fatalis?
hopefully the handler finally dies
I think this is the first time I've ever been intimidated by a Fatalis
Ha ha, and people thought alatreon should be nerfed
Whole asked for the bloodborne ost like?
The black dragon has returned
Eh. I know Fatalis is a big deal in lore but his design was never anything special and his fight in previous games were kinda boring. Can't help but feel they could've added something better.
Alatreon and Fatalis starting Ragnarock in the new world, while my boy Dire Miralis is crying because he wasn’t invited
It's ok Gore Magala.... we'll get in next time...
Oh my
NO ACE CADET, NNOOOO THE CURSE OF THE ACES
Prepare your arsses for the One Hit KO attacks
And it goes on and on.   But seriously, after Shara Ishvalda, Safi'jiiva, Alatreon and now this... someone NEEDS to die.
Fatalis, Fatalis, Heaven and Earth are yours...
0:32 That's the first time I think that the Sapphire Star had a genuine look of fear on his face.
Gentlemen, synchronise your death-watches.
This is cute and all but I'd really like to see some love given to the old player base that are still playing MHGU . We made the jump from PS2 to PSP to 3ds and now to Switch. Then we were abandoned after investing in a new system.  Please stop forgetting us.  : (  This is literally almost as bad as how Kingdom Hearts handles their fan base at this point.
<3
about time I hope they keep up the tradition of giving him the question mark for the monster icon
Ah all the newbies who are seeing Fatalis for their first time  This will be fun
Does this mean we're getting shipped to Castle Schrade to fight him, or did he find a 'new' old castle to destroy?
Well, the only thing left now is to get Crimson and White Fatalis in. Show the new players the true meaning of terror
Oh great another monster where you’re required to have a group and every member of said group has to actually be GOOD 🙄
Please don't put that DPS bullshit on this PLEASE
tonight gentlemen, we dine in hell
Dear God, I HOPE YOU GUYS PACKED YOUR BAGS BECAUSE YOURE ABOUT TO GO ON A TRIP
Omg!!!!
y'all were complaining about alatreon welp its about to get real now boiizzz
Finally... at long last he’s coming. His redemption for being as powerful as his lore says he is.
Lol Fatalis is a chump. Every monster in this game is an absolute chump. The real boss is the speed runners doing demon drugs. Fatalis will be on solo farm status within 2 hours of his release if he isn't on that already from a beta test.
We are all going to die 𝐢𝐧 𝐇𝐃...
Hunters: It’s over Fatalis! we got you surrounded!  Fatalis: The only thing I’m surrounded with is my victims
Man I'm glad I got back into playing MHW. Sadly I'm HR9 lol
I can already hear players making and signing petitions to make him easier, seriously tho I hope they hold nothing back, its Mfing FATALIS!
Finally. A true challenge for a dragon slayer.
Alright deep breaths....chil out
And yet people still go on and say Safi'Jiiva is stronger when the freaking Guild needs an entire army of hunters and even went to the New World for workforce to slay a Fatalis...  And they confirmed Fatalis killed the entire kingdom in one night, unlike Safi'jiiva who got killed in less than a day and it's super move cannot even kill people behind rocks.
Ladies and Gentlemen... He's here. Rejoice. The first to kill him will become insane and turn into his reincarnation. Sounds fun!
So did the Ace Cadet just die?
I’m hoping next game focuses on the ancient civilization. And then give us the opportunity to fight The Equal Dragon Weapon.  It’s a monster created by the ancient humans by sacrificing and putting together various elder dragon parts into it. I like the lore in that one, it goes into detail as to how humans and monsters used to live at peace and how destruction came and destroyed the ancient civilization.
Cant wait for casuals to complain about fatalis
Aight newbies, I got some advice for you: Tuck your head between your legs and kiss your butt goodbye.
It will be an epic fight!!! 😍 😍 But... All the Speedrunner will destroy this feeling and destroy the Monster..
The perfect ending for my personal game of the decade. It makes me sad mhw has come to an end but i'm also grateful that it happened in the first place. Best of luck in the future, mh team!
I can't get over how souls-like his theme is. I love it.  Never fought Fatalis before, hope this fight lives up to his lore hype. (Well. I fought Crimson in 4U. Idk why I haven't fought Fatalis yet)
Is he the biggest monster?
It is surprising that the Fatalis want to protect this area that much. The one responsible for Shrade's destruction no longer lives there (probably doesn't even want to see the place) and with this one, there are 2 fights with different Fatalis at these ruins. Why are they so interested on them?
Man, the bgm for fatalis sure brings nostalgia and epicness at the same time, cant wait for the grand battle in october!
Has anyone noticed the excitable a-lister has a heavy bowgun
Fatalis: “fine... I’ll do it myself”
Fatalis: _Where did that bring you?....Back to me._
Me: solos ever monster in the game  Also me: is there even a challenge  Fatalis: allow me to introduce myself
Hold on, a strong monster without a dps test? THANK YOU CAPCOM
YESSIR 🤩
Ace cadet better not die on jah bro
Wait if they add this Fatalis, they have to add the older version (White Fatalis)....
Hasn't there been a song stuck in your head? A song sung by children all across the land? A song with soul, sung diligently in the streets and in the alleys? What is that song?  'The legend of death,  death by a giant wyvern  has been revived'  It is 'The Legend of the Black Dragon'! Everyone should know it, as it is based on a famous fairy tale!  However, I think the fact that everyone is singing this song is actually a sign. They say children are always first to foretell the changing of the world. They are said to have a special sense for these kinds of things.I have gathered as much information as I could from the corners of this world, and I have told those who should be told. However, no one believes me. That is why I have begged for a few pages in Hunting Life explain the Legend to all who care to learn.'The Legend of the Black Dragon' is said to exist everywhere, and while there are changes in the lyrics depending on the location, the content of the song is the same. So please understand that the lyrics printed below are representative of the song as I know it. The lyrics may be different where you are located.  The Legend of the Black Dragon  When the world is full of wyverns  The legend is revived  Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched.  And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth  And melts through iron  He boils the rivers  And mows down trees  He awakens the winds  And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Call for help  Run for your lives  And don't forget to  Pray to the skies  10He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Fatalis, Fatalis  Heaven and Earth are yours  Fatalis, Fatalis  Heaven and Earth are yours
Oh man I can’t wait to see the normies on plebbit die from dehydration over all the tears they’ll cry over this guy. It’ll be alatreon 2.0
YEEEESAS
IT'S HAPPENIIIIIING!!!!
Bruh I still haven't beaten Alatreon....
Like I said in these previous trailers, World was the game the introduced me to monster hunter. And before Alateron, I never heard of the black dragons. So when he came out I looked up the lore of them and let me just say, I have never seen a lore that scared me more than Fatalis. Now Hunters of the Old World, is it wrong to say that I am terrified?
Let this be the most glorious fight ever
Monster souls
Good Hunting
Castle Schrade looking absolutely beautiful
Finally! a worthy opponent our battle shall be legendary!
Hell fucking yes, I have been waiting for this moment for years hahaha
Don't forget to wear fatalis armour...it makes you feel warm inside!
Long neck boi
*i can’t stop watching this I’m so hype*
Lets gooooo its been years since I fought the true monster God!
cant wait to spend 30 minutes on the mission and then fail
With that soundtrack, i thought we fighting Sephiroth
The music’s really good
Time to die!
The herald of the apocalipse is BACK!!!
OH BOY I CAN'T WAIT FOR REDDIT TO WHINE AND MALD OVER THIS, WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN TAKE DOWN ALATREON.
So it's thanks to our reaction of the 15th anniversary that let them add fatalis, we all through that fatalis was already planned for iceborne but apparently it wasn't and it was thanks to our excitement that he was put in the game simply because everyone wanted it. Honestly it's fitting the last monster in world would be fatalis, it's the icing on the cake.
Pls don't have an annoying dps check
I need to go to unfunny therapy after seeing some comments here holy shit.
I mean we all saw it coming, right? 😂  I wonder if they kept that mini icon as a question mark still, that'll be cool
I have a feeling this might be a challenge for TDS to speed run on the first day like they always do
Time for me to get my ass whooped
Dont worry new players fatalis was easy af in the older games. WAS Easy. They’re most likely changing his fight
To all hunters out there:   Good luck, and may the Sapphire Star light your way.
This is going to be a fun fight
SO PUMPED WE GET THIS BEAST! 7/10 mons on my predictions for iceborne!
I'm with the handler, "Hang on, no way" 😱
Never teared so fucking hard on a game trailer since gears of war did the trailer with sound of silence   . . .  The nostalgia is high in this one  and I know for a fact my boi fatlius is gonna have some fun clappin cheeks all day long ❤ #thankyoucapcom
There it is, at long last.
Me: I kinda wish they’d come out with more standard monsters as opposed to elder dragons constantly, Capcom: (makes this trailer) Me: okay, fair play
WHAT
Sticky ammo on his face
I hope that after we killed The legendary black Dragon Fatalis it will carry to the next game and the story is about the Ecosystem With the Leftover Energy caused by defeating Fatalis
Basically, what you're telling me is that the hunter guild in the old world got bodied by Fatalis, so they ask the commission in the new world for help? Is this an alternate time line, where the guild just consisted of NPCs? xD
Please, don't be a siege... Please don't be a siege... Please...
Fatalis is like Thanos he is inevitable.
Fatalis: *FINE I’LL DO IT MYSELF*  Oct 1,2020 Me: I told you, you die for that.... Fatalis: you,..you should’ve,..... you should’ve gone for the head! Me: (times up and loses) *NO!*
Me: DIO! FATALIS: JOTARO!  ゴゴゴゴ
HYYYYYYYPE!!!!
Now we wait for the Crimson and White Fatalis. Newbies won't know what hit them.
I'm assuming this is another monster I'll never be able to beat in single player.
I was worried when I heard the beginning of the roar, but then it suddenly pitched up and I was like “Yep, that’s how it should be.”
Hooooo boy...
Fatalis :oh you want to duel me mr. Big porcupine? Nergigante : I just want to know who the hell are you? Old man..
Fatalis gets ass handed by a Paratoad
Ohhh I can't wait my friends are veterans to the series while I am a noob and they kept on saying how hard he was and I can't WAIT for the absolute s*it-show that is going to be defeating him!
It's so good to see you again!
HE’S FINALLY BACK!!! YES! My old Freedom Unite nemesis!    Now, when do we get the Tonfa and Magnet Spike weapons in game, Capcom?
(When all other monsters fail to defeat the Commission.)  Fatalis: *Fine.* I’ll do it myself.
We missed you
**gore magala and valstrax have left the chat**
Visibly hype, rewatched like 7 times now
Give up all Hope... Surrender to the Dragon-God.... And give in to Despair
bahamut has arrived
Sounds more like a horror game to me
Te extrañe Fatalis, ahora vamos todos por vos.
If Fatalis killed my boi, he's gonna die  Why would you take the one character I loved Capcom?! WHY?!
I got chills just from watching this. Can’t wait!
It comes full circle now. Haven't defeated this bastard since MHFU days with my little brother - I've managed crimson in GU, but that's it.
Hello~
We all knew it was going to be Fatalis.  Fatalis: Hello there...
esta parte de mi vida, esta pequeña parte de mi vida, se llama felicidad..
Alatreon: y'all gonna wish you a stopped at me...  Hunters: why?  *Alatreon points to him*  Fatalis: been awhile~  Hunter: *no....*
Is no one gonna talk about the red haired boy probably get killed?
Alatreon: I'm the stronger dragon here. Fatalis: Hold my hunter!
Now there's a feeling I haven't felt in a long time. That cold wind creeping down your neck, the trembling feeling on your knees, the sudden urge to run and hide. The mere mention of its name sends shivers down your spine.
Monster hunter:battle of gods
Monster Hunter and Dark Souls are one of the few games i have seen that can make you feel Hyped as Hell by making you feel Fucked
At the beginning his theme sounds like its from attack on titan
It's been a long road with many Hunts and adventures. Thank you Capcom for all the updates and great quests. Here's to Fatalis returning and next Monster Hunter Game! 🍻
“Fine, I’ll do it myself.”
Ima be mad if he has a bullshit mechanic that makes him a grind in an attempt to create an illusion of a tough fight... here's hoping.
ah... time to bring that fire resistance up again..
Oh Yeah!!!  The OG is back!!!
Welp time to dance with the devil by the pale moonlight
Meanwhile Fatalis was pummeled into paste in Dragalia. And that was with no carts in sight.
Please be a better fight overall. If all they do is bump up his speed of attacks, it'll improve him a lot.
Awesome!  The area looks kind of small though doesn't it?
As long as his signature aint some escaton bullshit im cool
Wonder if they bringing. Crimson and white too
Ohh nooo..... my nightmare just came back.... and its soo beautiful it bring tears to my eyes
Hello old friend
This is gonna be worse than extremoth is it?
If this is really going to be the final update, THIS is who you bring in to top the game off!
Ohhhhhh myyyyy godddd the god of alll elder dragons woooooooo
the music score is unbelivably good, it gave me shivers... this update is one of the best in the game, it brought so much on the table!!! i cant wait to finally fight fatalis in all the glory of world engine and graphics, with revisited and enhanced AI, new moveset, and some sick weapon and armor design!!! capcom you made a great job with this game, we are all looking forward for your next game!!
So.. We may be getting the *SERIOUS HANDLER* ? Follow me here:  MHW isn't known for it's in-depth character arcs, so why suddenly lore about this sidekick character? Well he has something the community has been wanting for years: The _Serious Handler_ .  So what if they're planning to add more lore to him, so that we care. Then Fatalis comes around and turns him into a crisp, (which we can see about 47 seconds into the Fatalis trailer), establishing the last monster of Iceborne as big/bad/evil and we have to slay him to avenge our fallen comrade.. And in the end he either dies or retires and the serious handler is all alone with no purpose, thus gets reassigned to us having the choice between the normal handler and the serious one.  It adds lore, it adds a purpose to kill Fatalis, it gives the community the choice between serious/non-serious handler.
I still remember the first time I played my very first monster hunter game( mhf2 ). And now we are reaching the end of iceborne. It's been a wild ride bois we will see each other again in the next monster hunter game.
what i hope happens we face him down  kill regular fatalis  but everstream or what ever revives or somthing and he comes back as white fatalis or through out the story arc we go through each the fatalis  trio  due to ever stream reviving him or somthing. then cue  revamped  hot fish song
The Black Dragon History For New World hunters, who want to learn about this old tale  Once upon a time, there was an ancient civilization. Buildings that rose above the clouds, ancient medicine and technology far advanced from the present.  And so did the dragons and wyverns, who also once lived with the old civilisation in coexistence, used to build constructs such as towers and some buildings even made from said monsters There were also monsters used as guardians, even living up to this day.  One day, the old civilization decided to make a weapon.  The Forbidden Act. To create life, one must take another life in exchange  A living weapon was made, that was completely inhumane, costing the lives of hundreds of dragons and wyverns, all simply to make one weapon. The Equal Dragon Weapon.  This act of cruelty has angered the dragons, for the humans abusing the rules of nature and treating their kind as nothing more than cattle. Thus beginning an old and brutal war, but none was as enraged as one particular dragon, The Legend of the Black Dragon. Once he came into play, there was no side left, no winners, no losers. Ancient civilisation , now ruins Dragons, now old bones He did not care for either side, he simply hated all that lived and breathed.  And to this day, This living devil stands alive, the memory of its anger and history of humans ever burn so brightly since those days.  It melts both the armor and hunters who challenge it into its shell as if imitate and mock hunters. Its fire is so hot, the flames of fire dragons in the new world were comparable to that of embers. Even the equipment of this Monster can curse the hunter who defeated it, will have short, horrific lives.  Castle Schrade, one of the most prominent old civilizations to date, was attacked by this monster and in one night, it fell and became both a nest to this beast and a monument of humanity’s greatest failure.   Fatalis.  Now, hunters of the old world, time to face the living legend again.  And to hunters who started in the New World, have you heard of the old legend?  Note: This is one of the main reasons why the hunters’ guild strongly emphasize of the value of nature on taking what you need and its cycle of death and rebirth, to not repeat the mistakes of their ancestors  To those saying that there’s isn’t a lore and none of this is Canon, just enjoy the story This came from an art book of Monster Hunter and is one of the only sources of MH history At least it adds depth to this beautiful world And if you still want to argue or complain about the story like a Karen wanting to see the manager, go play in traffic
So they actually made him threatening? Cool but this is honestly pretty disappointing in my opinion. Digging the soundtrack though, very bloodborne like
I have to ask, what happened to the Secluded Valley storyline? At the end of the Alatreon quest, all the characters were wondering why both it and Safi'jiva would be drawn to the same place, and what the connection between them could be. But now, in the last update, we're finishing at Castle Schrade instead?
jogger fatigue is real
*Remebers Fatalis  and his other forms from GU And MH4U*  “Aw Shit here we go again”
I am happy and sad to... in same time,,, 😞
If that's theme for the fight... I will not be disappointed.
wait is this character development in my monster hunter game NANI
I got cold chills down my spine.
This comment section is wholesome af!
Nya...  (Subtitles: "Bruh...")
This whole trailer was an enormous orgasm
Ok, I could feel the despair in the air right here 0:40...
MHFU hunters.... *unite!!*
Oh my God it happened it actually HAPPENED! THANK YOU CAPCOM!
The day fatalis arrives;  4 heavy bowgun pierceshot speedrunners:  Allow us to introduces ourselves under 2 mins.
I'm getting too old for this shit.
I FUCKING CALLED IIIITTTT
"HUNTERS. SHEEEEEEEEIT!"
It's been a pleasure playing with all of you. I wish you all good health, and may the stars watch all over you.
finally, the OG elder dragon.
Don't cry because it's over... smile because it happened.
How well done this, in addition to the color of the sky, the setting, which shoots fire at the beginning reminds me a lot of the combat of the first Monster Hunter, incredible, that I want to have his armor in my collection, hopefully in the future they will put the white fatalis.
hype hype Hype HYPE
Damn and it's White Fata- *White Oblivion*
Who wins: A normal hunter with a sword or a gun or a dragon that can destroy the humanity?
I knew it!!!
the perfect dragon
Excitable A-lister, gets burnt alive Me who enjoys terrible puns: that wasn’t very gnarlycuga of you
Sisters and brothers of fifth fleet, may the Sapphire star light your way!
Aw, only the one?
If the A-Lister died.... Can I keep his handler?
New Hunters: Safi'Jiiva is the strongest elder dragon! Alatreon: Nice place, my nigga Veterans: Alatreon is stronger! Fatalis: THEME BLARES AS HE PULLS UP TO THE NEW WORLD Veterans and Newbies: S h i t .
You guys were crying because Alatreon too hard right? XD good luck now this monster is on a complete different level, you will need to get everything completely maxed out and even with that you will faint a bunch of times.
Maybe someone know the stats of bonus set?
I hope the armor set bonus is a five piece set that boosts all skills by x amount even going past the limit but in exchange you take more damage or have a change to be one shotted like the old version of the armor.
Seems I have about a month to beat alatreon
Men, synchronize your death watches
Its been a good fight everyone, prepare your gear we have 30 days to prepare then the fight of our lives begins.
based on how he is in the trailer I'm hopeful the fight is no longer just a bad joke.
NO, I WAS KIDDING WHEN I SAID "WOULDN'T IT BE COOL?"
Well lads we’ve been through hell but now it’s time to kill the Devil himself!
Please no more one-shot gimmicks...Please no more one-shot gimmicks...Please no more one-shot gimmicks...Please no more one-shot gimmicks...Please no more one-shot gimmicks...Please no more one-shot gimmicks...PLEASE NO MORE ONE-SHOT GIMMICKS!!!
Well I soloed on one major boss now time to solo for the other :'^)
How much you wanna bet this new character is gonna be in the next game?  No way they add a new character this late and not plan to use him more
Having played all the original MH games, Fatalis has always been easier than Alatreon. Am I missing something with these comments?
I haven't even betten alatreon yet, and now they want me to fight god... ok guys, see you in another 100 carts..
Finally I can beat it's ass
I had a nice life, I can die happy.
I don't think this is truly the end yet. Every update other than Rajang has had two monsters. Title Update 3 even had a .5 with AT Nami and MR KT so that's proof AT Valk doesn't count. Title update 2 had a .5 dev diary afterwards where they announced Safi.  They gotta finish the story with Safi and Alatreon. Just moving us to the old world to face Fatalis isn't any way to finish that. I bet we are getting a .5 with an actual conclusion.
Omg, is Excitable A-lister going to die? Please no, I'd rather Handler ToT
THE THEMEEEEEEEEEEEEE DUDE ITS SO GOOD
When I say I got the shivers from that, I GOT THE SHIVERS.
Yo that guy just DIED!
I hope it's really hard. And amazingly designed like Altreon
So we end where we began.
New Hunters: Woah cool new dragon  Old Hunters: * Begging for mercy of some kind * Me, who doesn't have World: *so it begins*
Fatalis vs. Alatreon vs. Safi’jiiva
Hahahaha it's over guys. We're dead.
I’ll watch people beat him, stopped trying after the last monster.
Nameless Fifth Fleet Hunter guy nooooo
NO I STILL DON'T HAVE ICBORNE IM BROKE WHYYY
Imagine if he was slow like in the other game
What would a JRPG be without fighting a God in the end ;) Also gives me Hope for White Fatalis in Worlds succesor so double hyped
Well......you know the rule, if there is vocal in the boss music you know this will be a pain train
Was looking for comments about how much we love Capcom for doing such a good job and I just see like-baiting trogs making Alatreon: durr Fatalis: HURR comments
Whether they will bring the red or the white one day🤔
Well, good luck to all who said Alatreon was difficult
Fatalis witnessed the ancient civilisation using dragon scales as armor and killing hundreds of elder dragons, so Fatalis did the exact same thing and burned the humans into his scales and killed thousands and thousands of humans. Not to mention Lao Shan Lung (one of the biggest monsters in the game) usually is always running away from Fatalis because he's that scared of him. True story
Me and Ace against Fatalis. I was thinking about it for quite a while.
Took me forever to take down Alatreon with my buddy, I guess I'll die then.
Only team darkside can save us now
we are so fucking dead
The Research Commission had swayed a living mountain, fought a dragon that could smother a whole continent, clashed with an unknown newborn god and though not canon, crushed invading deities that would have took heroes and armies to match.  But NONE of those can prepare them for the one who slaughter their very ancestors at castle Schrade...
IT'S A THE CASTLE CHARADE TOOOOO!!!
Love this new monster
Ah yes, the titan has finally been released. I hope the white Fatalis is the final big boi in MHW2
Omg THAT ROAR!!!!!!!
See, now I wonder if they'll add Crimson and White. I know that this is going to be the final update, but there's a chance that they might sneak in the two.
The music man🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Since chicken head is gone, can i have serious handler for the whole game now?
FINALLY!!!😍😍😍
Did he just kill one of the members?
The soundtrack
Alatreon: I'm the dangerous monster! Fatalis: aww, so cute
Gentlemen we have one day to live
W0W
Hunters! It has been both an honor and fun hunting with you all.. This is the last leg. The final mountain we must climb. AND CLIMB WE SHALL!!  Capcom thanks you for letting Monster Hunter do it's own thing cant wait for the next generation
Guess I have a reason to turn on my PS4 again
I want my mommy
I don't want to think that the A-lister just saved us and got killed
Alatreon: im the worst monster ever        Fatalis: Am i a joke to you?
I fear no alatreon but that's thing.......... it scares me 😨
OUR BATTLE SHALL BE LEGENDARY!
My toaster cant run mhw but naisuuu
History? Sir you've written more than history the moment Alatreon was hunted, FATALIS WILL BE BEYOND LEGENDARY The 2 most powerful monsters and we got them both in Iceborne fashion, 2020 wasn't actually so bad you know lol
Get ready for the grand finale boyz and girlz cause our last hunt going to be epic !!!!
When someone talked about a red monster, Fatalis heard and thought it was hot fish.
please add both Crimson and White too if this is the end let us fight all Fatalis brethren.
Oh yeah! Final and most terrifying monster of all MH series coming to THE WORLD. That location is castle shrade?Probably we will hear something about lore at last...
I want a sh monsterarts fatalis in my collection 😭
*God has joined the chat*
why am i not surprise also i saw some people hoping this would be like the magals or valstrax like they are saying the devs are going to give the maglas or val an update called"final stand" which is a update right after altreon update
When the world is full of wyverns  The legend is revived  Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched.  And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth  And melts through iron  He boils the rivers  And mows down trees  He awakens the winds  And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Call for help  Run for your lives  And don't forget to  Pray to the skies  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Fatalis, Fatalis  Heaven and Earth are yours  Fatalis, Fatalis  Heaven and Earth are yours. FATALIS, FATALIS.

WHO'S FLAME HAS SWALLOWED UP YOUR KINGS.  FATALIS, FATALIS....   Who every hunter wishes was just a dream.
Yeah my first fight against a Leguend
New players:This is impossible! MHF Veterans:It's not much but its honest work.
When the choir kicks in, instant goosebumps
be honest... is anyone really surprised? where else could they have gone after alatreon?   still hyped as hell tho
I'M CRYING
The only monster I can't solo in MH freedom unite
at least its not an elemental gimmick
If Safi'Jiiva was Great Red and Alatreon was Ophis, then Fatalis is Trihexa without a doubt.
So... Black?  White? or Red?
You guys need to remember this is the same dragon that did nothing but slither around like a slug and occasionally shot a fireball so don’t get your hopes up.
All my GU veterans know this will either be fun or incredibly boring
yes... Yees... Y E S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TIME FOR MY REVENGE MOTHERF*CKER GONNA BEAT HIM DOWN THIS TIME AND NOT LIKE IN MHU >:(
War has come, and there is nothing we can do to stop it, its been an honor gentlemen.
Please make this monster so very extream hard to defeated, we need more frustations 😂
lets see.if he finally lives up to his.lore
Turns out the real monster is the friends we made along the way
Best Brithday gift. (Born October 2nd)
Well guys it's been a fun ride.
I cant wait to hear people bitch and moan about how hard fatalis is
Someone: I hope that fatalis isnt that kind of unfair. Me: Look at this dude hehe
Thats cool!!!             We are dead
*Click* Nice.
Oh yes, yes. This will be great for my OCD, now there will be two quests sitting in my log that I will never be able to beat. That orchetra absolutly slaps though.
YEEEES
Lao Shun Lang flashbacks
Ace Cadet? More like Ace Cadead lol
I wish they would've added at least one brand-new monster before Fatalis ends the game but oh well...
The god of all monsters has arrive
well my fellow hunters old and new its been quite the journey in the new world to have it end in gen 5 at the most famous spot in the old world fighting the most famous elder dragon in the series
So that alatreon set may come in handy after all probably not
Psh...Fan made.   Lol jk xD xD
me, constantly getting carted for a 2nd time and thinking there´s no hope for me to beat fatalis. Monster hunter: plays ¨Proof of a Hero¨ me: you give me a strenght and a courage for the last time and now, it´s time to stand up and fight.    *FOR NARNIA!!!!!*
Thank you for everything Capcom, MHW was certianly an amazing journey, this update will be great.
I think I pooped my pants...
Alatreon is a natural disaster Fatalis is an apocalyptic event
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
28/08/2020  People: Hell yea im ready to cart !  01/10/2020 People: Capcom please nerf it it's the worse fight in the mh history 👀
K
Does anyone else hear Kokoto Village's music around the beginning?
Safijiva: Finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be LEGENDARY!!!
now the only question is, will we get white fatalis also??
I’m hoping that doesn’t have some kind of stupid mechanic like Alatreon or at fight in an area that gives me more of an advantage.
Ready to die Dark Souls Style?
Wait till October fells like a year in the next game I hope fully grown Safi’jiiva is the multiplayer final boss
We're dead. We are SO Dead
It looks like Excitable A-lister guy pushes you into safety away from the fire while getting covered in it himself. I think he pepsi
*Nergigante has left the chat*
Im still sore from Alateron
Fivers (Including myself) : *Screaming* Veterans: *Also Screaming*
This fights gonna be easy, lets get it bois, gonna absolutely cream this monster and then probably retire having beaten everything into a bloody pulp   This comment aged like milk.
I hope there will be crimson and ancient fatalis too 🙏🙏
HELL YEAH, WE'RE BACK IN THE OLD BOAT, HAILING TOWARDS TO A NOSTALGIC MEMORY LAND
Welp, this is it, he is here. GG bois, prepare the carts.
LS users: *(Black)Dragons are just bigger swallow*
2020 cant get any worse Fatalis - Are you sure about that?
LETS KICK ITS ASS
It would be really sick if nergigante suddenly show up and dive bomb fatalis
The last FREE update. Arrivals batle pass?
Do not go gentle into that evil fatalis.  Rage rage against the dying of your life
Please don't have an annoying unnecessary party wipe mechanic. Fatalis don't need that his tail will wipe plenty of parties on its own.
So, you know how we carve monsters we hunted to make armor for ourselves?  Fatalis takes it to the next level and melts the body of the hunters it has *hunted* to make it's own "armor".    BTW did you know that the Fatalis' main food was another large monster (it's a bit of an understatement) called Lao Shan Lung?
Ah yes, my noodle-neck boi is finally back.
I still haven’t beaten Alatreon ;-;
i missed the fattys :,) haven’t hunted one in YEARS!
*Sees a-lister die in the trailer* CEEEESAAAAAAAAAAAAAARR😭😭😭😭😭
*10th coming back to see if this is true. As a member of the fifth fleet, I can finally fight this legend... and get my cheeks clapped the first few times fighting him.*
Fuuuuuuuuckkkk yeeeeeaaaaaahhh! My boy Fatalis is here!!!!!°
That is just a big dragon tho? Nothing different from any dragon not from MH?
I love how this genocidal monster of unprecedented destruction is immediately followed by  "Join the hunt today! :D"
Is it the end of MHW?
THE BEAUTIFUL BLACK BEAST AGAIN!!
Ultimate Dragon Life-form: Jiraffe'jiiva.
*me who remembered that fatalis didn't have a one hit ko move* Crap
Time for an eclipse...
note : this is just normal fatalis  not white fatalis. normal fatalis is easy compared to white fatalis
Finaly
New hunters: oh he looks so cool can’t wait to fight him  Veterans: welp were boned!!
I'm still curious as to if we're gonna see a new kushala due to that shedded skin in iceborne
Will that be such an annoying “group only” quest or can I do it solo?
Oh god, they FINALLY did it! It’s the end of the world as we know it!
Let see how many day before some Hunter with 4 Safi HBG destroy Fatalis under 3 min
I fucking love how they used the old Arena
Run this fade Fatalis, New or Old World idc
I can already feel someone making a pointless petition to nerf the monster.
GOODBYE NEW WORLD
Bet you they're gonna pull the same thing they did with Lao Shan Lung and reveal that Safi and Alan appeared because they were just running from this thing.
Some random reddit guy : NERF ALATREON, ITS TOO STRONG" * *Fatalis Exist* * Some random reddit guy : .... :')
Well....we’re all gonna die.
I hope they make him extremely challenging compared to his old-school counter part. I want this fight to be something that I will and other hunters remember forever.
For everyone who MHW was thier 1st monster hunter, y'all have no idea what y'all about to get into. Literally every other monster was just practice.
New players: we getting fatalis yay  Veterans: getting PTSD oh God
So, fire resist lvl 3 and veggie platter with Alatreon armor?
So there's this classic tale of a knight fighting a dragon at a castle ...
I hope this will be harder than Alatreon
Oh man, I still can't even beat Alatreon!
Me who hasn’t even killed Alatreon yet Well s###
Can't wait for the white one
*Alatreon:* I am the ultimate introvert! Fear me and all my five elements!  *Fatalis:* Tch- that's cute.
If it's not harder than Alatreon immaa be mad af, but knowing Capcom and the little info they shared, we will be wrecked 😂
5 most powerful things in Monster Hunter:  5) Shara Ishvalda Shinra Tensei 4) Behemoth Meteor 3) Safi'Jiiva Star Fall 2) Alatreon Escaton Judgement 1) Fatalis existing
Let’s just hope it’s a proper fight and doesn’t have some weird DPS check mechanics like Alatreon does
The true black dragon has arrived.
Confrontation with the Black Legend Woman in a white robe: When I was a kid, I heard a fairy tale. A sad story about a certain kingdom... It has now appeared in front of us as a real disaster. Hunter, please. Get rid of that disaster. Don't turn sad stories into reality...!
Soooo how bad is fatalis
The Month Of My Birthday Is His Arrival.... How Convenient
One thing I always found chilling was that in the game Fatalis first appeared in, (cant remember), the first map you visit and fatalis' battle theme are about the same. Fatalis theme adds the chorus.   I always thought that was cool because it's the same theme you heard in the beginning of the game, but now with an apocalyptic feel to it! Glad to see some of the Verdant Hil-- old fatalis theme back!
It's was nice knowing you all
Gentlemen, its been an honour...  From our first Jargras we grew, we slayed beast after beast, in the smouldering mountains, in the frozing planes, in the dry deserts, in the beatifull forests, and even in dead monsters...   We ate, we trained, we grew, we became the Saphire Star that shine as a hope for our friends...  Now we face the dawn, death, god...  The ride was long, but enjoyable, Alaetreon gave us the thrill, and now we are ready ! Lets do this guys, The head of Fatalis will be the end of this ERA
do you see that big fireball when he is flying? that will be Fatalis' Escaton Judgement
THERE IT IS!!!!!!
Oh god I haven't even beaten alatreon yet but now this beast is coming
끼야야야야야야악  미쳤고!
i can only hope he lives up to the legends which surround him this time around.
Everyone else: Fatalis looks so cool, the game looks good, love you capcom!  Me: we can get cornrows now?!??
And the King rises again. Time to relive the PSP hunter days
Do I permission to resign from the commission?
finally fatalis will arrive soon while me still thinking how to defeat a fking arch tempered nergigante
I wonder what super nova it will have    Edit: It fucking hurts
Like how the ace cadet is wearing kush armor, guess he finally showed that rusted ass whats up
Lets hope this ends up being a better fight then Alatreon the no fun allowed monster...
veterans: this is how things are done at the old school
RIP EXCITABLE A-LISTER
"The hour for turning back is past, the world will have it's answer! You, or me. Death, or life beyond!?" -Grigori
All I can say is this...  You better not die Excitable A-Lister...  That would not be Totally Radical Bro!
Arch Tempered Velkhana is confirmed which makes me hope for some super crazy fights in the future like arch tempered Ruiner Nerg, Shara Ishvalda and Safijiva. Or dare I say... Arch tempered Alatreon and Fatalis 😏
We can pray, but God won’t hear us.
No other monster is fitting the role of last update
Alatreon: Fear me I am the great Black Dragon come to end you all Fatalis: Sit down bitch let me show how it's really done.  Hunters: Mommy
Weakness : to strong
Finish him! *FATALISTY!*
ありがとうカプコン
And therefore I wish you fellow hunters a happy and, most likely final, hunt.
NOOO THE HUNTER HE IS DIED
Bois.....im having Snap and Drag flash backs.......
If im gonna die, im gonna die fighting
He attacc He dont really protecc...  uhh.. anyway...but most importantly:   He got a long necc
Yes the nightmare of monster hunter is back
A good death is its own reward, fight the good fight hunters !
Can't wait for this. this better be MR100 and up. This monster will expose the shitters.
can we even kill him......?
Let's finish it with a bang, fellow hunters. Let's rewrite history!
im actually scared... By how generic he is like damn did they made him on an unpayed extra time on a friday to literally google "dragon" and paste it?
Fun Fact: According to in-game canon rumors, hunters who wore Fatalis Armor would refuse to take it off, eventually disappear, then a new Fatalis would randomly just show up like a decade later!
Ty developer team for the great journey .  You are the best   Happy hunting and Happy Birthday 🎊🎂🎁🎈🎉
Looking dumb and useless as always      my dear Handler.
Thank you Capcom !
This was my first black dragon back in mh4u, But I'm not gonna let it be my last!
now i believe 2020 is the worst lol
>Fatlais Title Card >White in the middle  >Crimson on the sides  Ah fuck, I cant believe they're gonna do it
Cadet just died guys
Could it be? Black Fatalis is finally getting a good soundtrack?
When the world is full of wyverns The legend is revived Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched. And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth And melts through iron He boils the rivers And mows down trees He awakens the winds And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction Call for help Run for your lives And don't forget to Pray to the skies  He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours
Hunters: alatreon was such a tough monster, but we managed to slay the beast  Fatalis: Lol
if its a fight like alatreon, then it isnt gonna be fun.
0:22 Canon Fodder detected.
Will this also have an escaton judgement?
You must Kabuki dance around him in 3 full circles each before he wipes your team
crimson, white and black fatalis..😨          ,yep we're all gonna die
hell yea
i came as soon i saw this    and i watched it and came some more.
Y’all know a monster’s fight is straight out of hell when their theme gets a FULL ORCHESTRAL CHOIR
THE END IS NEAR THE END IS NEAR SAVE YOUR POTION MANTALS AND ARMER THE ELDER OF ELDERS THE KING OF KINGS THE DEATH OF ALL FATALIS RUN IS NOT AN OPTION NONE CAN ESCAPE WERE ARE DOOMED (yeeeeee fatalis I’m so happy)
I wash they had black dragon jiva though
Fatalis: Tremble before me Humanity! I am the strongest monster ... wait I’m not?  Plesioth (About to hipcheck fatalis): *Never have been.*
0/10, not enough T O N G U E
IF ANYONE HAS ANY LAST WORDS OF HONOR, SAY IT NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOU PIECE! I WILL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE HUNTERS!(SALUTE)
THE WIND IS PUSHING M-  Sorry wrong Capcom franchise
This means our hunter on MHFU died, along side everyone who tried to kill Fatlis..
My old friend Fatalis... let us dance one more time for 150 minutes!haha
his tail makes more damage than escaton judgement
The gods have spoken.                *Fatalis demands Hot Fish.*
Fellow hunters, It has been a honor hunting with all of you, so, see you in the end of the word
I really hope white fatalis gets comes out as well.
Finally
the end is nigh
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
Well, it was nice knowing you guys
this entire cinematic looks like it came out of Dragon's Dogma, and i love it!
When the monster has a dramatic and intense opera as a BGM, better start praying to all Gods you know.
The True BLACK DRAGON IS HERE AND HERE TO STAY!!
This is coming out on my birthday xd this makes it even more exciting!
The real gods are the few select imanity
0:53 This wing, who could be?
So......  Are we especting to see our Lord and Savior    Gogmazios~~~ 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
My old friend, my old foe. We shall hunt you for the very last time in the new generation
well....i hope they give fatalis like it was in first series,which every of his move is damaging. that's gonna be challenge to fight him in world.
Love how he just slides in like “Good Evening Ladies and Gentlemen. I trust you are here for your once per generation ass kicking?”
The one who eats Rajangs as snacks has arrived bois
The hunter becomes the hunted.
Da fuq is the handler doing there ??
I'ma face the history of monster hunter!
Ah i rmb the first time i fought it, its pinky touched me, i died
Any word on the Fatalis variants? Perhaps as stand ins for the Extreme/arch tempered/ancient versions of itself?
Preparando el bote de vaselina..
When the end is literally THE end
The black dragon of dread, the harbinger of madness, the sole, breathing veil of apocalyptic death and destruction. The single greatest threat to all life, the lone, unmatched end to the Great Dragon War and nearly all who were involved, the last remaining denizen of the sundered, torn walls of Castle Schrade. The legendary beast known as fatalis has returned to see to it the end of the world, both old and new.   And then there's me, dressed in a cat head, holding a spikey drumstick that plays the songs of my people.   What a time to be alive.
Return of the king
Get me an X Box because this is a fight I went to be in!! Our legendary boi as back hunters! >w<
As a console gamer who doesn’t have online I just hope they alter the fight somewhat for solo players, as much as I rate the sieges I can’t do them
Now imagine a frontier white fatalis in iceborne
Welll gentlemen, here comes bomb reviews from cry babies again
Should I wear this thing's armor after killing it? What'll happen? I heard in the 'history' of the game that wearing the Fatalis armor is like wearing the Berserk Armor, only it actually and eventually makes you grow into another Fatalis.
Hold on I was joking about fatalis...... I’m sorry!!!
THE TIME HAS COME
Rip Ace Cadet. Looks like he tried to do what the Ace Commander did for him when Kushala played dead
Epic trailer for an epic monster!  Gentlemen, it's a pleasure hunting with you all. I'll see all of you at carting heaven.
Ahora si que se sacó Capcom el glande!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2020 looks bad but thairs a light at the end on the tunnel  The light at the end of the tunnel
Ok guys this is it the last stand, lets do it
we are all going to die. it was an honor hunting with you all
It's time
I hope they finally make him fun to fight....
Looks like he has a DPS check with OHKO just like Alatreon.... thats so stupid
They actually could put some fight while ur in the ship like Lagia
We are in the Endgame now
Time for another season of MR999's dying 2 times every quest.
There it is dood.
Welp. The return of the black god, end of civilization as we know it. The first god and the last you'll ever see.
Some serious Dragon's Dogma vibes
Behold...the most over-hyped, almost toothless and classic asf dragon in the Monster Hunter universe
Aww man I wanted the white one :c
Puta que hype
Newbies: Yayy A New Black Dragonnn😀 Veterans: God Help Us All😭
1:02
They better not do my boy cadet dirty
Para cuando un dodogama archicurtido? Jaja saludos desde chile✌🏻
LOL the people who were complaining about alatreon will never be able to conquer THEE LEGENDARY BLACK DRAGON. A LITERAL GOD AMONGST MONSTERS. That is if they actually changed his moveset to be somewhat lethal. Also now alatreon weapons are the best thing verse fatalis, just saying that because of fatalis's dragon weakness alatreon weapons will be very good against him
YES YEEES I CAN FINALLY DIE PEACEFULLY
I will absorb the soul of fatalis with my safi'jiiva armor.
Remember hunters all Elder dragon originate from THE Black Dragon
Fatally Amazing ending to this great hunting era. It's been a real honor hunting with you all. Let's cart this one last time.
Every FU player:at last, we meet again
I imagined it like this. My hunter from 4u had slain Fatalis, but his son (the one in world) gets a mission to slay the same dragon, who survived the last battle.
I'm so bothered by the roar
Imagine buying MHW to fight NEW monsters in the NEW world, but you end up fighting an OLD dragon in the OLD world
Yes
This isn’t the real fatalis...  He hasn’t stuck his tongue out once
Finally... a worthy opponent.  *OUR BATTLE WILL BE MYTHICAL!!!*  Edit: I will not wear any of its armor, though. Nor will I make any weapons of it.
I can’t believe Fatalis chose to wreak havoc on my birthday.
Time to overcome the myth, one more time.
Its him, finally, I have a reason to hunt once more!
So this will be the last monster? ;m;  I want lagiacrus at least just one more hic
praise the sun!!          oops, wrong game
Since 2004 i have waited our final confrontation I WAS A WEE LITTLE BOY BACK THEN NOW I AM MAN BRING IT ON
No Safi is not the embodiment of Dragon, Fatalis is
Still disappointed we didn't get Black Safi...
Hot Fish
Can we all take a moment to respect the Cart Cats who will be overworked even more than ever now the black dragon that single handedly ended the great war has returned
I think the excitable A lister is gonna die... 😵😵
I’ve faced almost every challenge new world has to offer and I welcome any new monster, but that thing “It scares me.”
AHHHHHHHHH WE ALL GONNA DIE
BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Hello King and Supreme ruler of ALL Monsters. THE IMMORTAL FATALIS!!!
Haha I’m in danger
Well can't wait to flare in like 3 Japanese guys to carry me through this.
HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPE HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
White, Crimson, Wrath Crimson coming🙃
I need a turf war between this guy and Safi.  Or even a turf war with a couple heavy weights going up against him. It could be dope
welp...I did ask myself how hard fatalis is and all...since i started in world
God chillings, literaly chillings That monster is the one any other monster wouldn't dare to fight
It's been an honor to hunt along side you guys. We all might use different weapons and bash each other for using them (other than HH) but we all are and always will be hunters. We have fought basically gods together, so if Fatalis wants to give use a fight then lets not disappoint him. Lets show him what the fleet can do. Lets show him what the sapphire star can do.
I’m scared
Some things of note; - Holy fuck, Fatalis looks cool - The Guild felt the need to drag us all the way to the Old World from the New World for this, that might mean that they don't have anyone else of our caliber on hand (or even alive maybe). - Where does the Jiiva story go if this is the last title update and it's not in the New World? They were pretty heavily hinting that we hadn't seen the last of the Jiivas in the Alatreon update, so where does that go now?  In any case, I'm excited for this update. I do sincerely hope that, if Fatalis has some sort of DPS check mechanic, that failing it does something interesting to the fight dynamic, and doesn't just bring about some lame party wipe or guaranteed cart. That kind of thing has proven to be infuriating when you can't deal with it and almost meaningless when you can, so please don't do Fatalis with it the same way you did Alatreon, thank you.
Understandable, Have a Great day
Really? Man out of all the cool Monsters they could have done, they add this boring one. Heavly disappointed.
Either Iceborne Fatalis borrows moves from crimson/white Fatalis, or they borrow Frontier Fatalis moves. Vanilla Black Fatalis is gonna be underpowered.
so the previous hunters actually failed... and died?
Well it sure was fun to be a hunter for the entirety of like half a year. Happy Death Day, everyone.
quem negativa um vídeo desse merece apanha na cara. o Rei voltou, que venha o White
Tell Dodo i loved him
We meet again... old friend *draws weapon
i guess the fatalis armor is like a secret cap destroyer, which means you can wear fatalis armor and slot in 7 levels of agitator or 5 levels of slugger
this is it. the final hunt.
The End all be all is finally here, this is it.... *FOR THE FIFTH FLEET!!!*
FATALIS: The ultimate goal of a Hunter!
Interesting to note that the situation seems to be so dire that even the usually charismatic and optimistic Commander is not expecting a victory. Not even Alatreon was like this. Looks like theyre going all out on Fatalis being the end of all that is sacred.  Also, holy shit Castle Schrade looks like a Demon's Souls level now!
It's been an honor, Fivers! Let's see this through!
I would have liked to see at least 4 more monsters before the final update but anyway I'm happy with the support given to monster hunter
Alatreon prepared us for this Hunters! Alatreon: B#tch you thought
When the developers say its tough, they meant an extremely brutal elder dragon.
the black dragon return
There's a reason it has Fatal in it's name.
Hell ya been waiting for fatails to come in to monster hunter world icebone for a While Our prayers have been answered
It ends when it began.....
0:09 this is where we know fatalis is coming
Can we talk about the music, though? That theme sounds straight out of Dark Souls.
So how will they ruin this monster for me? Does he now have the ability to kill you by looking at you, which can only be countered by using the wiggler helmet?
God has joined the game
first wyverian - "The Lord of Cinder has appeared.... The end is here...."
Well don't disappoint me fatalis just like alatreon because im to strong or us are to strong pls give me a good fight that last 20 minutes or more 😤
IT'S TIME. He's finally here in the game to kick some hunter's asses!
Monster hunter and darksouls crossover
And now we've come full circle
Rip my ps4 just broke :(
The only fatalis i ever killed. White and red were to OP😅
*heh*
0:46 Ace? Ace..? ACEEEE!!!!
Fatalism
As a new hunter who has an old hunter for a friend. All he would say is that we're screwed if we had fatalis. Now that's going to happen, I'm so incredibly excited and so unimaginably horrified.
Looks like i need counseling again
It will be a long hunt hunters and it will an epic one😎😎
*Story time for you young hunters* Legend has it that the hunter who killed Fatalis wore his armor but was haunted by the sounds of a faint heart beat that wasn't his own. Day by day the armor aceedingly got more and more difficult to take off. One he just up and vanished, and the faint roars of Fatalis did return to haunt everyone. *"As it's said Fatalis refused to die even in death and Grew a new body over that ill-fated hunter from the peices of its flesh on the armor"*
Did... did the excitable A-lister just fucking DIE
Ooooohhhh Myyyy Goooodddd
Why God please don't please.. please NOOOO... that's the face of all hunter's when facing it
I swear to god if they bring out White Fatalis. I'mma commit warcrimes on those monsters.
Something tells me this monster has going to be harder to fight then the last one
May God have mercy on our souls, and by God I mean Fatalis
So, Capcom managed to make a suitable environment for him.    I take back everything i said. I couldn't be happier to be wrong.
Holy shittt 😱😱
I played mhw on my friend’s ps4 and fell inlove again since mhfu era. Sadly i couldnt afford ps4 for my self but still watch ppl play it cuz i just love their contents n the game.
Our worst fears have come true bois death is nie
Well, so far, 6 people were trembling so hard they missed the like button.
FATALIS ON MY BIRTH DAY?! FUCK YES! THANK YOU CAPCOM!!!!
Fatalis is gonna be so fun one of my favourite gaming moments is soloing him on the psp version after weeks of trying
Everyone: *complains about Alatreon difficulty* Capcom: "Aight here's Fatalis"
"The Dragon Under The Castle"
And just like that, the true god of monsters has arrived
I hope this guy is actually as formidable as his lore this time
welp lets hope this isnt some broken monster
FINALY a worthy opponent    our batle will be LEGENDARY
Did.....did A-lister just die....?
0:41 thats the safi nova animation

Where are white and red fatalis? I want the fucking trinity to punish us xD.
Time to get carted, in full HD
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
Well his back but where is his uncle?(white Fatalis)
Can't wait to cart the first 5 minutes against him👍
Ladies and gentlemen, hunters of all ages.... Prepare for war!
Easy right...?
Aaaaand there goes my AT Blackveil Vaal Hazak, my boi and Narga got rickrolled.
I can hear the reddit crying already
He looks perfect!
I still haven't been able to beat alatreon
hell yeah fucking knew it. He looks identical to his photo in 15th anniversary poster.
OH SHIT
YES!!!  I wonder if they’ll have white fatalis in there too! Damn that would be a battle!
THE LEGENDARY BLACK DRAGON... DESTROYER OF SCHRADE AND THE RUINER OF LANDS...   ALL YE WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN OF THIS BEAST, PREPARE...
remembering those days when i first encounter it at the freedom unite
Jeje better pray all you know...
Please make his armour have good skills and not another useless set
I like how they're like the A-lister is the Ace cadet but it looks like he just fucking died lmao
It's about time this god of a monster was given his due diligence. Thank you, Capcom, for all the hard work your teams put into this masterpiece of a game.    Also, that fire is the most realistic looking fire I've ever seen in a video game.
Thank you monster hunter for the love for everything ❤️
i bet all my money this fire attack is a instandkill again....
Omg! I just got to new world, now him again!?
Of course the final quest has us return to the old world.
My old enemy, we meet again. I see you have become stronger but, you are not the only one.
Finally, the main antagonist is here!! LETS GOOOOO
At long last.... we meet again Old Foe
Nargacuga PLEASE!!! 😭
Mhfu flashback
I played all previous monsters hunter for this. All our paths in the world of monster hunter no matter what game you played have led us here. This is the final battle and it will be glorious.
There is going to be SO much complaining about how difficult he is.
Does this include Crimson and White Fatalis?
Ahh, the castle. Cool. It was on MHFU.
Can't wait!
Yes!!!! We're climbing the ancient tower again, my friends :)
Well... We are all fucked-up
*We should all be thankful that this isn't White or Crimson Fatalis* ... ... ...  (We're lucky it's not Frontier's own)
0:21 Um...is that sound the flare or someone dropping something off of a desk?
Oh shittttt they bringing him backkkkk
They ended updates with satan
Well, Lady's and Gents of the new world we are totally and roayaly boned to 15 new dimensions
Don't worry, the A-lister has some fire resistance.     I think...
remember how this bois playing us like a ragdoll in Freedom unite ?
Fatalis please be gentle it will be my first time with you~
Alright Hunters let's combine our forces and throw everything we got at that like button. Fight hard and stay smart!!!
So it has begun😨😨😨😨😨😨
I've fought it a couple of times and only beaten it twice, but now I am prepared. We shall see if all that fishing has paid off. >:3
My body is so ready to be melted onto the beautiful bastard.
thank you MH team and Capcom.. looking forward to the nextt MH game from you guys! 👍😊
So og fatalis is our final fight... I can see them pulling this again on the next monster hunter game but with either crimson fatalis or white fatalis....
I really hope they touch on the connection between alatreon and safii. Its impossible that they just gonna leave it at that after all that build up from the story.
Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth ARE YOURS 🌓
It’s the end of us all
God damn it 2020!!!
I live my entire Life, waiting for this moment,  I trained, i Lied, I kill, just for this moment.   I killed Safijiva, Alatreon and The other elder dragons.  I took life of their brother and sister in this new world..  And all these dead, just so i can Kill this history.🔥
Always has been...
I’m glad for this to be the final quest, I hope you all have fun hunting this beast!
Oh well, here we go again.
NOOOO!! PLEASE TELL ME ACE CADET ISN'T DEAD!! 0:47
The chad dragon that stands at the top of the ecosystem.
Crossplay pls :c
Fatalis: give me hot fish Hunter: sorry bro! I only have a cold frozen fish.
My hunter:  *yawn* *rolls over* wake me up when its a white one next time😴😴 jk im hype af
Oh helly yer wiggly tounge  is back
wELP  It's been a good run, lads
"It's been a long ride, fellow hunter. Now, shall we explore to the new world?"
What a way to send off iceborne....this game has been such a ride with all my friends. Sad to see it come to a close but excited for the final battle and the grind for the armor
YOOOOO
Who ready to get carted because I am ✋🏼
Do I see a Dragons Dogman resemblance at 0:41
I fucking knew it!
I'm gonna die.
🤩🤩🤩🤩
I still remember the quest names from MHFU : "legendary black dragon" (black fatalis) "the end times" (crimson fatalis) "ancestral dragon " (white fatalis )
0:46 looks like someone is about to turn into Fatalis’ scale armor
Hopefully Fatalis gets the rework/revamp they deserve, because the regular... regardless of the lore behind it.... the old fight was a joke
Shara Ishvala: fear me! Safi Jiva: No Fear Me!! Fatalis: ... *Who let theses kids in here* ...
Just waiting for ragegamingvideos to make a reaction video about this trailer. Till then 👌🏼
Oh my god the bit at the start of the theme :O
this is the end... we will die here and it will be   ..... Beautiful.... come now my brothers and sisters, all whom have been here from the beginning. This may be the ultimate test for the ultimate game
Capcom really listen to their fans, people been wanting this from the very beginning of MHW. 😆 I'm glad they save the best for the last 🎉
Finally a fatalis reveal
So many hunter will be lost that  day...
here's to capcom, for making a spectacular game that will live on in our hearts, allowing people to come together to hunt monsters and for focusing on making their content free for all to enjoy and not making it pay to win thank you capcom. Though its fitting Fatalis be the final boss. I'm ready for my last hunt, Hunters unit
Now even covid cant stop this thing.
RIP replay button.
2020 : Fatalis in HD
People in the stream were salty it was Fatalis LMAO, this is the absolute fucking best we could've ever asked for and actually recieved!!!!
0:45 Did the Excitable hunter aka Ace cadet Just die!
I just bought iceborne. I ain't ready for Aletreon and they add this?
Alatreon: I'm the black dragon that everyone hates to fight  Fatalis: hahaha funny joke Alatreon
0:39 Looks like another team wiping- hunter melting-dps checking-controller breaking attack lol
Well well well... here it is. Just as we expected.
You know all those rage threads about Alatreon?  Prepare yourselves.
Ahora mismo tengo el nepe durísimo
Meh. I wanted to finish with something new. Fatalis is boring af.
Well. Goodbye Gen 5 it is. See you hunters on PS5
Dammit capcom I can't even kill alatreon but oh no here comes fatalis!
So this takes place in his OG arena, and the Commander states that they “made their final stand here.”   Fatalis slaughtered them all.
The trailer, the characters, and everyone commenting tell me this thing is the end all monster. But it’s design just doesn’t hold up for me. It looks too scrawny and doesn’t really embody the power that it should have. Like obviously ittl crank damage in game, but l can’t help but be a little disappointed.
"The God has Returned..."
So i wonder howll they do his fight? A siege like safi and kt Or something like they did with alatreon Probably what they did with alatreon tbh
can you guys stop the hoo hoos and being such pus*ies we got an incoming dragon to fight!  * cries like a b*tch a few seconds after *
Thanks MHW, appreciated all the hard works
As a solo player most of the time whenever the characters say something about teamwork or friendship i know that i gonna do that shit myself
I got a massive question: would this fatalis be the one who destroyed schrade? or would it have to be a white fatalis?
Can't wait for the quest   SLAY: WHITE,BLACK AND CRIMSON FATALIS at the same TIME!!  XD
The fact that they didn't announce any oneshot mechanic (like Escaton Judgement) is kinda reassuring, but I guess it's still early to say.  Plus, what is the set bonus for Fatalis armor? They just teased it but it sounded like it will remove the cap for abilities...that would be INSANE, like Agitator 15 lol.  Ps: I'll see you on the battlefield brothers and sisters of the hunt.
Fatalis "Dude, what the hell is that hideous thing on your back?" Hunter "Don't... mention it."
It's been a good run boys, real good...
Hunting Horn user will be going down like the musicians on the Titanic.
People who doesn't kill alatreon yet: Oh, this is so hard Fatalis: Excuse me, what did u say?
Me: Our battle will be legendary! Fatalis: Are you sure about that?!
They literally have the best and the most hardworking studio out there. Spread  #thankyoucapcom
Fatalis, Fatalis... Heaven and Earth are  yours... Fatalis, Fatalis... Heaven and Earth are yours...
did guy die
The OG granddaddy. The newer hunters about to LEARN.
Newbies: How strong is he? Veterans: Remember when humans populated the entire planet in this game Newbies: No? Veterans: EXACTLY
Thank you Capcom for bringing happiness & good moments to gamers without asking for much ❤️❤️
Stay ignorant of what the true fear is. There are things better left unknown. Just light the flame and burn it all.  Well, the True Fear is here.
Imma die so many times to this thing
October 1st confirmed. Spy: Excellent. Gentlemen, synchronise your Death Watches.
Hunters! Hide your Hot Fish!
F
Ace cadet is dead 🦀🦀🦀
Fatalis : (Licks mouth with chaotic intent)
Capcom i love you!
I bought this game when I first came out, because  I thought it looked cool. I've struggled against Nergigante, Deviljho, Behemoth, Lunastra, Shara Ishvalda, Rajang, Raging Brac, and recently Alatreon, but I have always come out on top.  Nine hundred hours in this game have led to this moment. Fatalis is coming, and I will not be defeated!!
Imagine the crybabies when this got released
So does this mean there’s never gonna be a White Fatalis fight?
He will not stand a chance against the New World hunters.
A legendary black dragon said to have prowled these lands from the days of old. Many skilled hunters have sought to challenge it, but none ever return. A monster shrouded in mystery...
When the world is full of wyverns The legend is revived Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched. And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth And melts through iron He boils the rivers And mows down trees He awakens the winds And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction Call for help Run for your lives And don't forget to Pray to the skies  He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours...
I hope he's FINALLY getting a fight that lives up to his lore!
This gave me actual chills!   Edit: Also I’m really happy that this hunt takes place in Castle Schrade again!!! A trip back to the Old World again, my fellow hunters! 😄
ahhh one of my worst nightmare is back ~
Haven't fought fatalis since like 2004 lol
0:44 when your boi sacrifice himself to save you R.I.P
0:29 Are we gonna talk about Dalamadur?  I feel like we need to talk about Dalamadur.
sad that we won't get ardent and white :(((
Aren't we also getting all the master rank armor?
I feel like there should be a battle royale between Fatalis, safi'jiva, Alatreon, and Nergi for dominance.
Synchronize your watches fellow hunters! Death comes for us in the form of the black dragon! A great challenge to be sure, and one we shall relish in! Sharpen your blades, the time nigh!
It's been real, y'all. Time to find the dragonator one last time
I really hope this isn’t like alatreon. And what I mean by that is my success in beating this monster shouldn’t be based on some random threshold value where if you don’t reach that threshold, the monster’s ultimate attack WILL KILL YOU
Welp we are all terribly screwed
My fellow hunters... both Rookie and Veterans... even if I thought along side you or not. It has been an honor... to fight by your sides.  LETS SHOW FATALIS ONE LAST DAMN GOOD FIGHT!!!
It’s been a good ride gentlemen.
Well time to practice
Safi Jiva: Come play online Alatreon: Send petition to capcom Fatalis: Mark it, we bomb capcom headquarters 🤣🤣🤣
the petitioners to nerf Alatreon must be crapping their pants now. lol
Welp.. here we go agian hunters! Let’s give it our all!
I am still curious if they are gonna add the remaining AT MR elders 🤔  Adding just AT Namielle and Velkhana doesn't feel right  They never mentioned it so I am gonna guess no ... *sad noises*
"Will you follow me, one last one?"
Ralpheal (Rise of the TMNT) He's back.
Capcom you are  amazing   Making such badass game   Thanks for those hunts each of it  Learned a lot and improved a lot  Can’t wait for the next hunt in the next game
*Flashes back to failed Crimson hunts* No... not again
New world hunters: a new monster this’ll be fun  Me and everyone from old: WE’RE F***ED
Chills...
Can we talk about the new rendition of Fatalis theme though ? I mean dang......
0:21 I wonder if he’s referring to the Ace Hunter and how they encounter their end ... and that’s why the ace-cadet it’s so interest in the story this time
Old hunter : fatalis is easy i beat them many times New Fatalis : *Im gonna make you die SAY GOODBYE* 🔫
Excitable A-Lister died? Hopefully not, he'd just be carted, right?  Cuz it will make a continuity error like during a Safi & KT Siege
It happened... it finally happened. I couldn't he more proud of the monster hunter developers for continuing strong with this game. Been at it since monster hunter freedom and to see this guy in HD like this brings a damn tear to my eye. Thanks Capcom
Damn, so no final form safi? This will do I suppose.
I was expecting gore magala as well. Sad.
The final update, i'll miss this game, the best MH i ever played.
i think i saw the smouldering carcass of my old MH4 Ultimate character smeared on Fatalis' arse in this video.
Stupid question, but were there other Hunters at that place just before we arrived? If yes....has Fatalis acquired them for its own...set armor? :S  'insert most scared face you can imagine and multiply it by 10'
Well boys  We are dead
Looks so boring
To all hunters. Let's reborn and meet again in 6th fleet.
I'm honestly tired of fighting Fatalis in every main MH title
now all they have to do is actrually make the fight somewhat fun and challenging something they couldn't do before with the big fat dragon and his frail neck.
Fatalis : *announced*  Me : damn can this get any worse    Plesioth and khezu : *slow clapping*
Alatreon: God sent me to give hunters the ultimate challenge. Fatalis:...... I didn't send anybody.
And after we all fight Fatalis, and Iceborne is finished, we can look forward to the next game in the series, now that World/Iceborne has properly introduced the franchise to the masses
God that music is so fucking good.
Lets give him a new world welcome
0:21 mad lad rocking the guardian armor to hunt fatalis
*sad dalamadur noises*
Oh my god... The first black guy in monster hunter history?!
ah yes.. the world ender itself
awesome btw poor Exitable A Lister
The A lister dude suddenly changing weapon??    no wonder he get carted
Hunters : ALATREON IS TOO HARD, NEFF HIM CAPCOM 😭 FATALIS : LOL,, HOLD MY HUNTER.
Where's my Valstrax? D'x
So we’re just gonna ignore safi and alatreon in the secluded valley? Idk about you guys but I feel that capcom is hiding something about this update...
Finally. I wait for so long and now he is finally here.
If they could get this guy’s neck to work, I’m surprised they couldn’t do the same with the leviathans
God help us all for what we think (and happen) next 😨
WHEN IS DRAGONS DOGMA X MHW CAPCOM????????
When other monsters can't beat hunters properly . . . . Fatalis: Aight... guess imma do it mahself and ObSeRvE.
ITS TIME
It’s a dream come true
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEÈEEEEEEEEE
When the world is full of wyverns The legend is revived Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched. And blood is sucked up dry He burns the earth And melts through iron He boils the rivers And mows down trees He awakens the winds And lights an inferno He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction Call for help Run for your lives And don't forget to Pray to the skies He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours
This was so hype but so sad at the same time. Happy Hunting everyone!
H Y P E
I like how the commission general flinch shots outta there, "Toodooloo ^£$£kers"
Mh4u i come back
I love how OP our hunter is. Made it all the way to fatalis with hunter gear and a bone greatsword. That madlad.
And here i thought Alatreon is hard
thanks for all CAPCOM and all the people involved <3
Wooohoooo
0:23 is it just me, or...... “Hot fish hot fish hot fish hot fish hot fish”
YEEEEESSSSSS
one shall stand one shall fall good luck Hunters
*General and Admiral meet* *Hunter suddenly gets turf war notification*
Hopefully the armor isn’t what ends the sapphire stars story
Gonna miss the new monsters to come :'( wouldn't mind to pay for another 10 expansions like iceborne
Our fight  will be legendary!!!
HYPE! and ready to get cart over and over again
Vengeance from the past. HE'S HERE!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you Capcom
The end is near...
no gore magala :(
Thank You Capcom and more specifically, MHW devs for making this game and listening to the fans. Love, from a fan  Will be waiting (and keep playing MHW) for the next Monster Hunter game.
Sweet mother of Christ!!
I know this is wishful thinking but how awesome would it be if crimson and white were secretly added? 😩💦
Why hasn't something come after us? Where does one draw the line? And if we were to be obliterated, who would do the deed?
day after it comes out:  IDeVaste: Fatalis 40 second speedrun
Well, it’s been good fella’s. See you in the next life cause we about to get fucked! Plus rip red headed hunter
the legendary black dragon is here boiii🔥🔥🔥🔥
Then imagine in MH XX where you see a cat fighting against a literal god.
“And now, the end is near And so I face the final curtain My friends, I'll say it clear I'll state my case of which I'm certain I've lived a life that's full I traveled each and every highway But more, much more than this I did it my way Regrets, I've had a few But then again, too few to mention I did what I had to do And saw it through without exemption I planned each chartered course Each careful step along the byway But more, much more than this I did it my way Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew When I bit off more than I could chew But through it all, when there was doubt I ate it up and spit it out I faced it all and I stood tall And did it my way I've loved, laughed and cried I've had my fill, my share of loosing And now, as tears subside I find it all so amusing To think I did all that  And may I say, not in a shy way Oh no, no, not me I did it my way For what is a man, what has he got If not himself then he has not To say all the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels The record shows, I took the blows But I did it my way.” -Paul Anka, 𝑴𝒚 𝑾𝒂𝒚. 𝐴𝑛𝑑 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝐶𝑒𝑙𝑙 ; )   Thank you all for the amazing hunts. May the next great monster hunting game be truly awesome and respectful to the genre. Happy hunting!
Capcom you magnificent buggers.
To everyone who wanted Fatalis to be in World: You got your wish.
Fatalis 100% deserved to be the final monster to return. He has the heaviest backstory/history against the humans in terms of lore.
I didn't like my HP green anyway Why??? cuz GOD is here
I’M ACTUALLY POGGED OUT OF MY GOD DAMN MIND
October 1st. Just in time for spoopy month. And this will be the most terrifying of them all
Thank you Capcom!
MH Tri fans: Alatreon is the best and worst monster! Monster Hunter World: I love Anjanath  Fatalis: What's up  MHFU: O______________________________O
Time for the new hunters to know what real pain is
fark yeah
Consider me thiccened
We make our final stand At the ruins of the fallen
So what were up against isnt a monster. Its actually history Zorah Magdaros: :(
Started playing MHF2. This series has come so far. I'm so proud that I am able to play this game in my lifetime. See you in Monster Hunter 6, fellow hunters!
yeah ummm I’m crying from tears of joy and tears back from memory lane
Please let the other Ace Hunters show up in the story to support their boy!
이거 밀라보레아스임?
When the world is full of wyverns   The legend is revived  Meat is eaten, bone is crunched  And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth  And melts through iron  He boils the rivers  And mows down trees  He awakens the winds  And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Call for help  Run for your lives   And don't forget to  Pray to the skies  He is called Fatalis   The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Fatalis, Fatalis   Heaven and Earth are yours  Fatalis, Fatalis   Heaven and Earth are yours
here go again  fatalis
OMG I can't believe it!!! Fatalis hear me out, I will take my revenge from MH Freedom Unite that I never could beat you. PREPARE YOURSELF
Ty for being an exception in this market, Capcom.
Oh dear God
0:41 my god that shot with Fatalis trying to use his skill with his majestic black wing. Perfection  Massive F for Narga
I'm fucking hyped. However, if fatal isnt reworked from previous games, and is still a boring fight, I'm taking someone's head.
Excitable A-lister just strait up dies!
He´s back, a battle in the end of the world. Nice!
No one gonna mention that ace cadet sacrifice himself to save us?
The time has come m8s, the true og black dragon is here
Yes. I have been waiting for this day!
I never fought him before as World is my first MH game but I'll be honored to go 1 one one with this legend come october
and this is how you end a game, with the fucking BLACK DRAGON
I think the excitable a lister is gonna become bbq
To all the people that said Fatalis wouldn't come, take the L!
The hype is fck reallll
MR100 trying to join the quest “ kick them now!! “ hahaha
who else Cried at the end of the Dev Diary??
This fight better be more exciting than it was in the older games, he is so cool but a bit meh
Yay, the most overrated and unoriginally designed Elder Dragon to ever hit these games... Woo...  In all seriousness, I hate all three of the Fatalis. So much. It's so basic and just pumped with a lot of damage in its attacks, with no hint of originality or flare of its own. It's just a dragon, and people seem to love it for what, exactly? Being a basic dragon, just tough? Lagiacrus has had more character in its basic form- heck, not even its Abyssal subspecies!  I love you, Capcom, been following those games since Freedom 2 on my PSP, but I implore you, give focus on more original flagships instead. Gore, Lagia, Seregios, they're all infinitely more interesting to hunt than Fantasy Dragon #19127.
Iwae! known to be the the original Black Dragon, he whose flames embodies the fires of hell, the first of many debuting in the first game! Fatalis! heaven and earth are yours!  Cringe aside, I can't contain the excitement of what Capcom will do to this infamous dragon. I still got the save file for his final rounds in freedom unite hahaha
I like, but still pretty sad it wasn't Gore
The time has come.
Damn my asshole JUST started healing too...
So we’re going back to the old world?!?!?!
When the world is full of wyvern The legend is revived Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth and melts through iron He boils the rivers  and mows down trees He awakens the wind and lights an inferno  He is called fatalis The wyvern of destiny he is called fatalis The wyvern of destruction  Call for help and run for your lives And don't forget to pray to the skies  For he is called Fatalis the wyvern of destiny He is called fatalis the wyvern of destruction  Fatalis fatalis  heaven and earth are your  FATALIS FATALIS *HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE YOURS*
No way alatreon used to be easy difficulty
Can't belive this is the end. Thanks for everything!
The almighty dragon come to get slap by 4 HBG speedruner on October 😐
best game devs by far, thank you for all your hard work!
I was hoping for Valstrax but this is okay too. :D  Thank you Capcom. :)
Two things:  •1. Fatalis. *ALLLLLLL* of the yes. •2. We fight him in Castle Schrade. Dope! •3. Oh my god, the A-Lister is fucking *dead!*
Sounds like Fatalis has a nasty roar.
The Legend of the Black Dragon When the world is full of wyverns  The legend is revived Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched. And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth And melts through iron He boils the rivers And mows down trees He awakens the winds And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction Call for help Run for your lives And don't forget to Pray to the skies  He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destiny He is called Fatalis The wyvern of destruction Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours
Everyone predicted that
thank you Monster Hunter Dev Team
CASTLE SCHRADE IN IT'S FULL BEAUTY. THE GODLY SOUNDTRACK. ALL IS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE DRAGON GOD ITSELF.
It's time for a festival of carts baby! make sure you eat for insurance, safeguard and gem in fortify
We're in the Endgame now.
Castle Schrade looks very menacing now
I can't believe they did a crossover with Mario Odyssey
Runn
Cheers to all my fellow hunters 🥂
OMG
0:47 DUDE THATS WHAT THE ACE COMMANDER DID TO SAVE HIS OWN MENTOR AFTER HE DID THE SAME THING TO SAVE HIM!! Does anyone remember?? The ace commander wanted to take on the Kushala we know as rusted, and his mentor the master of defence took a blow for him that ended his hunting career. Then the ace commander saved his own pupil, the ace cadet the same way. Now it looks like the excitable a-lister (ace cadet) is going to continue the pattern. Oh goddddd I’m scared
New Hunters: God, Iceborne is so easy!  Rajang: (Crack Knuckles) Safijiiva: (Readying a Death Beam) Raging Brachydios: (Licks his Slime)  Furious Rajang: (Cracks Knuckles but in Super Saiyan) Alatreon: (Laughs in Elemental)  Fatalis: (Laughs in Superiority)   All of the Title update monsters: Allow us to Introduce ourselves.  Veteran Hunters: (Looks at the new Hunters) First time?
This is it. In october we fight.
I am honored and grateful to Monster Hunter. You have given us more than we all expected. The joy, the hype, the frustating, the greatness. All that for free just for us.  I thank you to be able to have the chance to even experience monster hunter. I hope and wish for all the monster hunter team, a wondefull life and a great success.  THANK YOU!!!!! 😊😊😊🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍
Aight Gents. Are you ready? I hope you are.  All these years of support and feedback to Capcom led us to this magnificent moment.  This game will go down in my list as the greatest game I've ever played
Thank you, Capcom for such a fantastic game and supporting it for 2 years. Hope to see a next generation MH someday, will be waiting for it with anticipation.
They could fix the constant crashing that still occurs on nvidia gpu's but sure
Hunters my fellow fivers go fourth and bring hope to humanity we will go to where he lives and we will destroy him!!
Should of added white as well
will it be a heart pumping challenge or time bomb spongefest. we shall see
Early generations of MH had Fatalis oneshot you from a simple slap... Literally, and at end game defense no less. I miss those times and am psyched for whats to experience next!  00:38 getting a signature oneshot attack vibes here also
We just not going to talk about Excitable A-Lister? Too soon?
*pretends to be shocked*
Heck YEAH!!!
Was hoping for Dalamadur but i'm not disappointed at all, fatalis looks awesome
My tears of joy will soon turn to tears of pain when Fatalis rips me a new one.
Can't wait to cart with this bad boy
If you guessed the next monster is Fatalis, congratulations! You won 52000z. Let's finish this monster once for all. And... *_Acta est fabula._*
Been wanting to square up against this fella since the OG Monster Hunter.  Now my time has finally come... To cart over and over again...
Gentlemen synchronize your death watches
Hunters: Alatreon is too strong please make him weaker! *starts petition*  Fatalis: Hold my Castle Schrade
That music tho!
Fellow hunters, it has been an honour, happy hunting to you all!
Love you monster hunter team <3 Thank you for 2 awesome years!
Shame no white fatalis. I vote for white damn
Now after this final update for the whole game, means it's done and they can focus on making MONSTER HUNTER WORLD 2 for the next gens!!
Handler : so we're not up agains monster. But up agains history. Hunter : yeah now we'll become history itself
*carts furiously*
It's gonna be FATALis.
Big PP time
We better get a teaser for the next game when we beat the lad
So we meet again..
I hope he will be easier then alatreon. (naah dont think so) Hello from Germany my fellow Jägerfreunde.
Quest: The way of the Gods Location: Castle Shrade Client: Self important Researcher Slaying Quest: Slay an Alatreon & Fatalis  Hunter! Oh my are things bad .. I was on my way back from my side of camp, when i got ambushed suddenly, by what i can only describe as an 'Otherworldy Presence'. I saw a pulse of light, then a swish of a tail, followed by an ungodly roar. Please, hunter, you are our only hope. THEY have returned. or rather .. .. HE has returned.
WHO'S READY TO GET CARTED BY FATALIS!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      me
Alatreon: It's good to be at the top of the food chain. Fatalis: *Allow me to introduce myself.*
I have fought, captured (that can be captured) and slain every monster in MHW so far. Alatreon was tough but seeing that mission complete screen felt me with such joy. World was my first ever MH game and I'm so glad I am a fan now.  I will not back down. I will not run, I will stand and fight against The Black Dragon of Calamity.   HUNTERS! Lets show Fatalis our strength!
And from that moment I knew god existed, and he hated us
we killed everything in the new world, and god came to punish us
For all the people who started on world, this guy is called the god of all monsters
If the white fatalis is also here we are fucked
Thanks capcom, thanks.
Peak
Great trailer but I would have loved it if they added Fatalis through a hotfix and waited for people to stumble upon it before officially revealing it, would have been fitting for the original Black Dragon
get ready to cry
Fatalis got in.   Meanwhile...   Lagiacrus : "LET ME IN! LET ME IN! I HAVE LONG NECC TOO COME ON MAN"
Is a time where companies will take your money and ask over and over for more, giving you part of an unfinished product. All of the franchises that have fallen to the cash grab and hunger for more money at the expense of their fans. Yet this one. Monster hunter. . .  It makes me really. . . Really deeply happy, that one of my franchises has gotten so much love. At every turn the monster hunter team has given us so much, so we wanted, some we didn't know we wanted. As a fan since the very first day you started releasing games, I'm saying this from the bottom of my heart.  Thank you monster hunter team, thank you so much for caring about us.
Fighting Fatalis in GU: haha longboi  Seeing Fatalis finally getting the revamp he always deserved, and knowing we're all going to die: gentlemen, it has been an honor...
When is it coming out for pc?
Please, let it be a normal (and epic) fight. They didn't mention any siege nor special gimmicks and I hope that it stays that way. Just not a fan of how they handled the last couple monsters' fights, although the monsters themsleves were amazing.
what a great (early) birthday present ❤️
I'm shocked... This is the first that the fleet looks helpless...
HYPE
I knew it...
It's scary and mysterious that the devs explained nothing about him. With Alatreon they showed some Armor Skills, the Escaton Judgment. With Fatalis...we know nothing. This fight gonna be hard as hell.
Nooo.. Poor Ace Cadet
Not a suprise for sure but a welcome one
So did they remake the fight or
The Legend is back
Great, mh6 when? (Jk i friggin love you guys, keep up being awesome)
Hunters: Offf alatreon is dead Fatalis: Whats up fu**ers
though i doubt that it's the case, it does look like your 'friend' got fried there
FINALLY !! BRING IT BOOOOII, MI POINTY SPIKY TOOTHPICK IS READY TO STAB THE HELL OUTTA YOU
I’ve never been this happy and sad at the same time
Happy Hunting 👊
Thanks Capcom for the immense and FREE support for Monster Hunter World/Iceborne. As a veteran, I just can not express how happy I am to see all these new people falling in love with the franchise like I did several years ago. Fatalis is the best way to end it all with a BANG, thanks again.
Well we’re boned
*Me waiting for his white cousin singing a song about a certain hot fish to come*
Yeeeeee
I’m fucking speechless, the king of kings has returned
Change dot org is waiving 😂
If ace cadet dies im gonna cry
He looks so good with iceborne graphics! #ThankYouCapcom
How hard is fatalis compare to alatreon ? I mean alatreon already have 4 element
Thanks for the all content guys. Been playing since PS2 MH1, I am so happy how far the team has gone.
Thank you for your hard work as always, Capcom! Im literally crying right now.
Omg omg omg he’s here!
Dark Hunter 3
that castle getting destroyed part look so much like dragon dogma
They confirmed that The Exitable A-lister was the Ace Cadet
I wonder what Bullshit OHKO mechanic  they are going to add to this Fatalis boss fight? Give us the new MH on switch already hopefully they dont F that up aswell.
Let's see if he is still as cheesable as in MH4 and MH Gen U
gw alatreon belum menang j****k
Watching the Dev diary made me appreciate all the feedback and hype that people gave towards Fatalis last year during the series' anniversary, they weren't gonna add him but after seeing how people were hyped they just decided to do it. they really do listen to the fans and thats why this game has been a huge success!
One of the greatest games ever made! Thank you Capcom! Can't wait to see what's next
it's sad to see that Fatalis reveal is 10x better than the 1st part of the Gamescom 2020 games reveal
No Narga Variant, BIG SAD!
Shoutout to the FUCKIN HUNT!!!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I hope Fatalis is as strong as he is in the lore. His fights in the other games were extremely lack luster
Man, they are going to have to make this a nightmare to be worse than Ala, keep that in mind everyone
...... oh no
Ladies, gentlemen, palicoes, its been a privilege to Cart with you for all these years
Geiler scheiß
Thanks for making my game of the generation!  Y’all have truly set the bar for how to update a franchise to be more accessible without giving up its identity. <3
The final boss of all the final bosses finally shows up!
Thank you monster hunter devs for the amazing journey
I am ready for more PAIN
Sooooo... This gonna be their last video right ? :( it's just like a week ago to play this game and come to the End :(
Welcome back old friend.
It's been so long since I've fought him and now he looks so good
This is going to be a tough fight and really enjoyable I can already tell
Thank you capcom for your amazing work! it's been a blast to play this game and can't wait to play more of your games in the future ^^ Monster hunter will always have a special place i my heart.
Hmm I still think final form or AT Safi will be a thing, but they're saving it as a surprise.
3 minutes gang
woah WTF yoooo capcom Monster hunter TEAM Thank you your the best holy
YEEEEAAH BABY
Intense panik begins go insane
My only regret is that his theme isn't Proof of a Hunter but with vocals
OH MY GOD THERE HE IS!!!! THERE HE IS!!!! THERE HE IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!      Ps: To all of my fellow MH players out there....... we gonna die.
It's over. It's fucking over.
What is that armour A lister hunter wearing . Also while seeing it live for a mere second I thought it was gonna be Dalmadur lol . I am very excited for it . Thankyou capcom and developers of MHW For the beautiful game you made .  Edit : thanks for letting me know what armour it was . Never really bothered to hunt kushala that much in master rank . So didnt have much idea of its armour either .
Ahhh, our prayers finally answered 👏 Thankyou God-Com
Finally, the literal god of Monsters.
I'm glad I took a chance on this game over 2 years ago it's been some of the best and most enjoyful moments. I'm glad I finally got to experience the monster hunter community thank you capcom ❤
The Fatalis palico armor is an accurate representation of what every hunter will look like 🤣
RIP shagaru magala
My boy cadet wearing kushala armor, finally the guy got some clout.....   ....Ah shit, he died.
Ah yes, this shall be fun. Fall to meet the DPS check in the first 30 seconds and Fatalis nukes your entire game save, uninstalls Iceborne for you, and crashes your system. I can't wait.
And thus the "theory" of Safi'jiiva absorbing Fatalis bio-energy to become a true black dragon has been debunked...    Thank Gog!
The Legend of the Black Dragon  When the world is full of wyverns  The legend is revived  Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched.  And blood is sucked up dry  He burns the earth  And melts through iron  He boils the rivers  And mows down trees  He awakens the winds  And lights an inferno  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destiny  He is called Fatalis  The wyvern of destruction  Call for help  Run for your lives  And don't forget to  Pray to the skies  He is called Fatalis
they'll just turn it into another siege
Oh boy here we go
The God of all Monsters is finally here
You've given us fans so much and I cannot wait to play the next title.   Thank you capcom!!!
The A-Lister fucking dies
Yes, the worst fight in the series is back. Woooo
Alatreon: A Fatalis: stupid noob, let me show you how it's done
Did the ace cadet just die?
The end is here!
Was it worth it to stay up till 5am for this? Fuck no, not for some overhyped dragon, I bet covid scrapped the actual last monster... Worst timeline ever
Rip excitable A lister
Sick
IM SO GLAD THEY FIXED HIS SONG. Its not 10 second loop of the same song anymore
Can't wait for the salt on release day.
back to grind again guys, u better prefare your tools and mental before get carted xD
AAAAAAAAAA
Why people dislike the video they gave us so much content for free...  Happy hunting
POG
I love you guys! Thanks for everything!
and now we wait for the ragegaming to post on there channel
Thanks Capcom
This is gonna be good.
Ace cadet killed a Kushala, good for him.
YEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!! FINALLY!!!!!!
That fireblast, damn!
*Grabs Funlance* Ahh shit, here we go again...!  You ready hunters?
Players: NERF ALATREON! Capcom:
Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours Fatalis, Fatalis Heaven and Earth are yours.
When the world is full of wyverns  The legend is revived  Meat is eaten, Bone is crunched  And blood is sucked up dry...   All Hail Fatalis, Heaven and Earth are yours !!!
If you can't beat alatreon  Don't ever face Fatalis
We welcome the arrival of the true king.
POGGERS
Are god
The god among gods. Now if only we could fight the one that split the continent into the old and new world.
RIP ace cadet
He’s beautiful
Welcome to the new world old friend /enemy.
Aw yeah! Never fought Fatalis before, hope it goes well!  :D
Best game Publisher in history. Well done  Capcom, please never change.
The fucking music! Aaaahh!!! I'm having an eargasm!!
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
JE SUIS MONTÉ !!!!!!!!!
Please don’t have a DPS check, please don’t have a DPS check, please don’t have a gat dayum DPS check!  After killing Alatreon enough times, I’m good with never seeing that again!
Bul’taaar

Mi tula acaba de crecer a 5cm con este trailer.
I can’t wait to get carted endlessly with all of you wonderful hunters
no way
I can’t believe excitable A-lister FUCING DIES
Knowing it was coming didn't make it any less exciting
The king has returned. Now to see if they do a mission based around the armor. If you don't know why I want a mission based around armor ask and I shall tell.
Sad we ain’t getting a narga variation but Fatalis looks so good
Death awaits
Well Hunters, New and Old, lets finish the fight.
Must really suck being Nargacuga, the only early-mid game monster without a subspecies or variant in world
Sad to see that iceborne is done now
