Man, I wish it was live
Why would Mustafa Ali betray the WWE locker room?!Traitor!!!
I still come back to this video every now and then.  It's such a shame the potential for this was so squandard.
1:25 I mean how many times did the hurt business fought RETRIBUTION
A few years later and you remember how dreadful the Thunderdome era was.
Ali🎉
Ali is the goat🎉
I caint believe it's been 4 years
It really hurt me when Mace turns into Ma.çé
0:05 😂😂😂😂
Bane
Wtf was the point of all this?
Why was Cedric Alexander not with the Hurt Business and Mustafa Ali until Ali turned his back on the Hurt Business and then teamed up with RETRIBUTION?
This gimmick was so bad I completely forgot what they were called lol
Watching this again makes me mad, because retribution could have been something special if it wasn't for vincent sextraffic mcmahon
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

From this to X DIVISION TNA CHAMP I'm happy for him now
I wonder what 3H could do with this group today….
Wish this type segments deserve fans and now Ali I's TNA
My birthday
The line “Get him” was absolutely 💯 on point love Mustafa Ali
valeria ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
That was the moment wwe peaked
0:39
An uncharacteristic leader of an uncharacteristic group.
This was a great reveal it’s just too bad that Retribution never was anything special due to the horrible booking
Thank You Ali
Well Damn, does Ali really hate this company from that time. He'll be like, "F this, I'm gonna call out my gang and destroys this company!"
Outstanding match💪
✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌
NXT
You know i am gonna say this and i may catch a lot of hate for it but i am gonna say it. Retribution to me. Looked awesome. The Mad Max style masks, Ali given something to work with, the potential they had as stars. It was so cool to me.
bring Retribution back and take on Judgement day
Only ali is Best Indian full support❤❤❤❤,,,ali is best
Get em sick them with the venom slow down the momentum
This was one of the worst things I’ve ever seen🤣🤣🤣
why did they have to ruin mustafa ali the way that he is now. Seems like he had more depth a few years ago
its reminded me assassin creed odyssey ghost of cosmos in cult
Major missed opportunity with Mustafa
2020 was really a painful year of watching WWE
Missed opportunity just to make ricochet look good
I liked the moment when He said  GET HIM
Mustafa aliiiiiiiiiiiii❤❤❤❤❤❤
This slipknot concert really broke down
WWE Really Stuffed this Story Up
So how did this turn out? 🤣
Ali: Get them! Mace: Roar!
Retribution under Hunter would’ve worked. No silly masks, stick to their characters, it could’ve been good
Why does mvp’s screams sound so weird like “BYAAAAAAAAA!!!”
Can we please have Mace got back to how he was in Retribution? That is the best character/gimmick Brennan Williams will ever have! The character looked awesome, and would either do fine on his own, or put him with the returning Bray Wyatt! Bray is a creative genius, put Retribution's Mace with him and he will know exactly what to do! 👍
Best segment
nc
Musifa Ali is my favourite superstar ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Y'know... Looking back on this, It was a fantastic idea... It should've been executed better... With a bigger name as leader.
Hahahaha love mustafa
1:12 LMAO 🤣
Ahhhhyeehh
Who's here after Mace joined Maximum Male Models?
What could’ve been…
I just dont understand why people didnt like it..i thought this was the coolest thing ever! we havent had an Anti WWE group in years
I am absolutely delighted and grateful with this awesome transformation in my life after using Dr. kwaloe on you tube supplement for the genital herpes virus, Now i am free from it after several months of battling with the contagious virus.
Mustafa Ali brilliant wrestler Mustafa Ali will win title in hell in a cell 2022
Mustafa Ali next us champion Shinsuke Nakamura Jinder mahal Sami Zayn all Asians are smackdown champion no asia raw champion that's plz give me us title to Mustafa ali
Mustafa Ali is King 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Mustafa Ali vs austine theory hell in a cell 2022
Mustafa ali need championship wwe
When Mustafa Ali champion wwe
Bro mace is the best because he got a cool moves
Those group when they saw ali approach these unormal human being they smiled like they are mocking him and Though thats gonna be 2v1 But ther' smile perished After ali tourned around
Nothing annoys me more than a massive build up only to be dropped in a few weeks. Ali was done so wrong with this one.
This would have been big with a crowd.
Creative really killed what could’ve been an awesome faction 😔
The beginning of the end of this faction was when ali was revealed as the leader
wow shaaaiiie\
Allah Allah  Mustafa
They could have done more with Retribution.
Wish they'd either push Ali or grant his release
The fact that this didn’t get mustafa ali a world title makes me sick
Look how they masacarrrrrreeddd my boy
Retribution had potential to be the next big stable since The Shield and The New Day
When mustafa ali champion wwe ?
Mustafa ali vs brock lesnar wwe championship match
Mustafa ali good highflyer
When mustafa ali return wwe
When mustafa ali champion wwe ?
Don't try to become wytt family or shield
This one segment made Mustafa Ali a legit star and a credible challenger for the world championship, I just couldn't understand how Vince dropped the ball on him and retribution as a whole
This shocked everyone when Ali reveled himself as the leader of retribution for sure
Nice ❤️❤️❤️👍
Nice game Mustafa Ali
Love Mustafa Ali love Pakistan💕💕
Free Ali
This didn't age well.
Today Mustafa Ali is Requested to Release from WWE 🥺💔
What could've been a great stable, damn WWE knows how to ruin good things for us 😭
today, ali requested the release from wwe. wish u all the best one of my favorit superstar
I’m here because he requested his release.
جيد
This is the most badass heel before randy
Wow,
A stabble that had everything to be successfull. Thank you Vince for screw it up. For me now it worths watching WWE only for Roman, Lesnar, Rollins and female roster.
Dammed
Retribution ----> JOBBERS ❌
retribución wwe
Mustafa Ali is best fighter in the Wwe
Love how he said Get them
What could’ve been 😩
The worst and weakest group WWE ever created lol Shane McMahon could beat all of them up in a handicap match.
The Predator and Bane!
to those of you didn't know i was a part of retribution. you will see the guy behind mvp.. i'm the guy on the back. behind mvp. 1:14 look closely. that's me stretching and raging for fight.
ThunderDome was all about the teams and factions
Lp
The heel of a heel is a heel
N71
WOW AMAZING
"GET EM" -- Ali, 2020 Unbelievable quote.
Wwe ruined everything
1:19😈🔥
Remember when we thought roman was the leader
Mustafa Ali is the best man
Man this angle sure tanked.
wwe sucks in 2021
Mustafa ali so hensem
Mustafa abi SSSEVILIYON
They could of done something. But they really didn't
Aye atleast MVP asked ali "are you with us" 😂 asking for backup without knowing
Ow yes ali
What what what what what what what (?)
Me and Jim seems like a definite possibility, Recently I think he got fired.
ححححححححححح مصطفى علي ! 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Line ali
Man. . .  Mace is a definite favorite of mine  That wicked gaze tho (｡♡‿♡｡)
Totally drama
no body care about pakistani wrestler.
No one cares about retribution
I am big fan oh the mustafa ali
Retribution vs Nexus make it happen
I wish dean ambrose was the leader but gave them their names from nxt and have shield outfits
Love how the hurt goes from You moron ali To Ohhhh flip where doomed
Was Ali waiting for Thor's hammer at the end?
Big fan mustaffa
OH MY GOD ALI IS WITH RETRIBUTION
This did not age well
1:20
WWE TOP 🤜🤛👏😏
Mustafa is good man
Super match
Annnnddddd 6 months later they went from terrible to absolute trash.
A retribution member is looking like Dean Ambrose 🙄
Who woulda thought, that in 6 months both groups would be gone......smdh yet another waste wwe
مصطفى علي مضربة😂😂😂😂😂
Basically much the new Nexus
The moment Retribution died. When we all found out they were taking orders from a loser 🤣🤣🤣
Who is here after end of retribution?
Retribution was nothing but a means for mustafa ali to become champion, once he couldn't mustafa's true colors came out
And in the end they ruined everything. Retribution could’ve been so much better. Ali could’ve gone for the US Title, Mace/TBar tag titles, Reckoning women’s title.
I Love Mustafa Ali
He is pakistani So you know all
Everybody knew what Wwe was gonna do to em and they gave Mustafa Ali a Wade Barrett storyline lmao
What a sasti acting😂
garbage, this group is over lol
🚶
Who’s here after they broke up? Thank god!
It's been since October and they bout to break up already
Who’s Here When All The Members Of Retribution Just Walked Out On Ali Tonight
Who Here After Retribution Betray Mustafa?
😊😊😊😊😊
Anyone here after Vince dropped the ball on Retribution?
aaah SaniTy and Retribution; the two factions have so much I mean So much in common! I mean both have a female member, both team had the camera shaking and swinging like crazy on the entrance, both team were introduced as dangerously strong at the beginning and astoundingly Retribution is also moving towards the same fate as SaniTy did, that is eventually become a jobber faction and then be broken/released.
Wow
Would be be funny if u all would add the rock and jimmy to the hurt buisness it would be a great addition
Retribution is the worst team of thrown-together Superstars. They will never be anything more than just those dumb names. Slap jack has to be the worst name of them all. Sucks to have a name in NXT and then just disappear into obscurity
It's already been obvious that Ali was the leader,
Ufff When the shield is here💔🥺

Now Retribution is rotting away
dövüştürdükleri adama bak 140 kg mustafa ali yerine ufuk yılmaz'ı koysaydınız daha iyi olurdu
Man such a cool reveal. And then everything went downhill
The Retribution members are more like The Winter Soldier, The Predator, Bane, Jason Voorhees, and Hannibal Lector.
Wao Ali is the only person that is very dangerous members of retribution
Ali is hero
When my teacher says no homework for the weekend  1:12
it  nobody  knew  the  story ends.
Give Ali a chance
Very good Mustafa Ali
Mustafa Ali is one of the most underrated wrestlers in my opinion. If you disagree, it’s ok tbh. He’s gaining popularity more if I’m correct.
Lol retribution is just nexus with silly names
0:03 the sound when I get hit in the spine
They would turn the middle eastern wrestler into the bad guy
I am from Pakistan
Can't beet them join them
@1:21
Retribution vs nexus
Is that retribution member a female?
The look on MVP's face 😂😂😂😂
Hahaha so funny
Mustafa Ali rock 😎❤️🔥
And of course. Lashley gets the worst pain.
If nothing else good came out of 2020 at least it can be said that Cedric Alexander and Mustafa Ali had two of the best heel turns ever.
Love u pakistan mustafa ali
1:20
ali
1:21 GET 'EM!
OMG 😱 this is too scary to be true and the truth is your boy Ali he’s a hacker
R
Love it
Show them the power Mustafa...
Why is every good person I know becoming bad (Roman reigns, and him too☹️😔
The only thing I hated about this reveal was it was so pointless to have Ali pretend to be with The Hurt Business.  It didn't help catch them off guard or help Retribution.  Seemed really unncessary.
Bobby lashely is the powerhouse
I love mustafa Ali
Nutface is my favourite retribution guy 😎 followed by U-turn and Steve
This man is so talented We are proud him
Why does T-Bar look like one of the old acension guys I forgot their name but the dudes with the spiky armor
Mustafa Ali is the leader of retribution but why is he so tiny? 2:42
People who hate WWE ———————->
Imagine if Mustafa Ali wins the WWE ChampionShip while being the leader of Retribution
Ohhhhhhh my god I'm sacred now
Oh my god I'm scared now
Peshay loog hay hi nahi
This was a turn I never expected. Sucks that now they are losing every week, being booked on the fly whatever that means, and have no real direction. I love Ali man. Love Dijak. Love Mia. But this sucks man.
I hope they're around for a while!
Retribution is the new Nexus
The tall dude in dreads gotta be Tyler reks
my enemy's enemy is my friend
I want to be part of retribution to who else wants to be part of retribution
I always wanted to see the nexus if they were all fans of my chemical romance
Ich heise aur ali
Wwe is not what it use to be. Now it's just b it seems everyone is a heel .
Ali is a pure genius!!!! Retribution is perfection. And this guys finally got what they deserve. This is a lesson of life. If you have the fire inside, don't keep it forever......... Retribution is all about it.
Bast ali
Do this to rollins
wait what is all this?  is this the new shield? havent watched WWE in a while. man i miss 2013
ali went from a 71 rating jobber to a 90 rating superstar here
Mustafa Ali has never been, but he doesn't love anymore BJ man from wwe:(
lol....i thought CM punk would be their leader
musthafa ali is now n rutribushon
Whatever happened to Retribution?
He returned 3 months ago now because of RETRIBUTION he f*cking betrayed wwe!
Ali can't HANDLE THIS FULL SQUAD
Just acting lolol
Underdog moment he breaks out the hurt lock and locks in his and has lashley tap at wrestle mania. The man deserves it let him run with it then have him drop it to ricochet.
Good job wwe now pls put the us title on Ali. Lashley vs. Ali wrestlemania
My sapot Mustafa Ali
Yea, I knew the Retribution's leader would be Mustafa Ali according to the comments I see on Instagram!
The WWE try so hard to remake the NWO like the WCW did. But it's not working out, NWO was full of star power you name them they were part of the group
God i love RETRIBUTION, they are the judge, jury and executioners.  THEY..........ARE.......RETRIBUTION
I just like how MVP starts to laugh when Ali went to confront retribution and stops laughing after Ali said get them
1:13 that face switch tho 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mace reminds me of Edge when he does his slide/crawl entrance in the ring 1:39
Still miss nexus
Hi
I hate  Mustafa Ali.😤😤😤😤
Ali The Leader Of Retribution Smackdown Hacker
change Ali as the leader. boring
Love you ali
Wen I’m gonna be old I’m going to wrestle in wwe I’m a Muslim like mustafa Ali my name will be Rashid Ali
Very good
Who are the retribution if the shield and other wrestle fight
RETRIBUTION needs to be scarier.
Mufasa leading his pack
Ali is amazing I love retribution
Ali join AEW
Wwe should saved it until the audience came. No rush.
Theres only 1 DARKORDER These are Wannabes JOBBERBUTION 😃
Retribution is the aces and eights of WWE
This is givin me Nexus vibes
I like Slapjack talking but literally just making noise while Tbar kept screaming,  Tbar: THIS IS RETRIBUTION! Slapjack: Eheheh nyak nyak mahp mehp wap  Tbar: THIS IS RETRIBUTION!
I think there is twist that mustafa ali is not main Leader of retribution i think the leader was unexpected WWE superstar  I just think
Retribution always gives me the Money Heist vibes, with Ali being the leader acting like The Professor.
Pakistani leads RETRIBUTION🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
His father is from Karachi , Pakistan.
Мустафа супер
I remember when retribution first started appearing if u looked closely you could see that they where almost all normal size people  none where as big as these guys are now
Juuuuuuu
Is just me or does T-Bar resemble bane and Mace resemble the predator
In my opinion, the fiend should be the leader not ali
Retribution is still the dumbest gimmick in recent memory. It’s WWE’s version of Antifa.
That line "Get him" that just nailed it. Man what a heel turn by Mustafa Ali. The guy is just so talented, give him chances please
Please change the mask's
halloween LOL
Mustafa ali love you
I am happy for Ali he is getting the spotlight which he deserves 👍
Who's here after they r buried
very good 👌 Ali ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Mustfa ali ❌❌❌💪💪💪
Retribution
Fucer usa.
Mustafa Ali 😍😍😍
Türkkkkkkkkkk
Hurt bus, such trash gimmick all old and bobby lash has no personality, the most uncool thing a black trio can do lool the hurt biz is so pathetic lool
Ali, you traitor!
Their names are GODAWFUL no one in retribution will ever win a title t-bar the face of wwe nope Slapjack nope... Vince needs his meds asap
Mustafa ali good
I impresed to mustafa ali
anybody remember tna...aces of eights..and bully ray (good guy) is actually the leader ? hmmm
So the mysterious hood guy in the back studio operating the cctv cameras  is non other than the police officer Mustafa Ali. Shocking revelation
Mustafa is awesome
I didn't expect from Mustufa Ali
please i want the hurt business face turn and so strong
Mustafa Ali in this segment has more Monday Night Messiah feels than Seth Rollins imo.
I don't know who any of these dudes are in retribution
scary stories to tell in the dark
owsaday wwe like kindergrden
Johnathan Blazier Mustafa Ali Tag Team retribution
I had known for months that this would happen mustafa Ali was the smack down hacker
The HURT BUSINESS So freaking lame, written in GOLD LETTERS... OMG that is three of the best wrestlers in the game doing the most predictable black stereotypes I ever seen...
👌👌👌👈👌👌👌
1:14 when your schools calls your mom saying u missed 6 days and she pulls out the belt
Very nice good boy Ali 😲🤩🙋‍♂️👏👏👈
I like to see the shield fight retribution
The retribution is fulfilling the place of. The shield
Loving this storyline  Pls push ali
In the retribution r truth is thier
The 3 Things no one can count :  1) Water  2) Number of times I failed in Maths  3)Number of members in  retribution.
Change their name to suicide bombers or isis, taliban, that would be most fitting
Imagine this as a WarGames Match. Ali, T-Bar, Mace, and Slapjack vs. The Hurt Business. Has potential!
Get em
Finally
Me: "mom, can we get the Dark Order?"  Mom: "We have the Dark Order at home"  The Dark Order at home:
Ali ali ali ali ali ali ali ❤️❤️❤️
My god!! Mustafa Ali are in charged and responsible for this serve attack of retribution on every brand of WWE! Retributions leader is Mustafa Ali
What an awesome reveal.
I can't believe this
Y Bobby lookin like a video game character in a fighting game🤣
The writing department is doing great now omg
My wish this time is ali time because WWE Big push for ali i think Ali coming up your Royal Rumble winner and WWE Champion
Wao Ali is Good Drama When Retribution appeare ..Unbleveable Ali is Leader of Retribution ..Ali is Great Wrestler if Ali is work Hard for Wrestling I hope he become a new superstar insha Allah Pakistan zindabad
So is Retribution about to be WWE's version of the Bullet Club?
I hate him now I use to like him
So is this supposed to be wwes version of the dark order?
I Knew all this time Mustafa Ali is the leader of  retribution 😡
Retribution  is the dumbest thing that wwe ever has done...I mean what us there ultimate goal...its like they are supposed to be portraying the  protest and riots ....STUPID
The wrestler that would slither in the ring is The Predator
There's a past wrestler that would slither in the wring that I can't recall
Well Bane is Ryback. But I could ne wrong
Ali the leader? Boring. Zzzzz
They still need to upgrade those masks tho
Ali's retribution name is light bright lol. How can they say "slapjack" with a straight face?
Do they follow Dark Order??
The shield,dx,brothers of destruction all together will destroy retribution
Why anybody don't realized that the Hacker Story is Part of the Retribution build Up?
And i hoped Aj Styles is the Leader......what a dissapointment......
2005:Divari 2020: Mustafa ali
Who is supporting retribution and ali hit like
Raw needs faction vs. Faction storyline
Nice 👍👍
Lead the wwe
Ali should be the united States champion
Team retribution should win the raw tag titles
Super destroy hurt business mvp,Shelton Benjamin, Bobby lashley.
Next generation of nwo or nexus.
I want to join them
I like retribution
Haha
I love you so much mostfah ali
Love you mustfa Ali
Anyone saw punk and nexus there or was it just me
Alli told retribution to get them
Retribution is like the NWO.
CALL COPS NEXT TIME
2:42 I came late, When I changed the channel that what I saw. I was confused af.
I guess Hurt Business was hurting for bidness
When all of us never saw this coming...
Those dreadlocks...... DIO?!?! (Marcellus Black) *edit* I think I just had Ali heelturn a week prior in my 2k19 universe too lol
This reminds me of the ministry of darkness somehow....
So how does retribution  gets green lit while but sanity gets killed
Mustafa Ali is the leader of this new faction? 😝 😜 🤪................oh wait you're serious, please allow me to laugh harder 😅 😂 🤣
Get em woah
I like it to Ali become the Leader of retributation
Going heel on already established heels.... Damn I like this storyline
Can't lie, Dio Maddin or Mase whatever looks pretty badass
WWE is learning from their mistakes Giving nice storyline to talented superstar  I hope this give him big push as he deserves it
Still think Bobby roode's retribution.. would have gone long way Outsider like nwo..
What about Rich and apollo
I love Mustafa Ali ❤
I started laughing cause the hurt Bussiness face went to 😁 get them Ali to 😳🤔
Yo that why we love wwe they paired aladdin with predator,bane and jason much like a disney horror show😂😂😂😂😂😂
I would love to hear the capacity crowd...whether they boo or chant.
Great idea not having them on right after this so dumb
Hey retribution get released right now ho bags
I can't tell if this force is heel all face it's hard to tell
Looks pretty stupid if you ask me...didn’t know AntiFa, Bane and the Predator were in WWE until today
That scawny piece of 💩 is the leader wow
MVP  Facial expressions 😂
Mustafa is the mufasa and retribution are the crew of lions
I hope this is a good push for him
Told ya! Ali is the mastermind of the Retribution. The Mustafa People Power!
I still can't believe that Ali is the leader of RETRIBUTION
mustafa to dark order
Bro I have not watched wwe this whole year who tf are these ppl
Marcos
türk rüzgarı
This show used to be so great what happened to it 🤣🤣🤣🙈🙉🙉🌎🌎🌎🤐🙉🙉
Mustafa Ali? It was you behind this RETRIBUTION attack all along! But why? Why, Mustafa? Why?
You gotta wonder how that merciless Mustafa Ali how long he been planning this RETRIBUTION assault on the WWE?
Omg ali is the lider
1:24 That is the most satisfying “OMG” I’ve ever heard.
Pakistan ki ammi ki chut marunga 🇮🇳💪
Lmao wack ..
Make it bigger group. With black. Woods. Owens. And possibly ricohet
The Hurt Business deserve this for them to bully the whole company, how does it feel
Can't get over how damn ugly MVP is.
The ultimate SJW is revealed as leader of Antifa??
I guess Wrestling was the next correct step for The Predator after those damn sequels !
Mustafa Ali zindabad
MUSTFA ALI PAKISTAN ZINDABAD
Ali it's the best, from indonesian
YAAASSS!!!!
Wow, more repeats. Watch this only last 6 months then it’s done.
W🔥W
Retribution is 2020 in a nutshell and the look on MVP face was all of us
Hahahahahah so false,
2:43  Ahhh.. that priceless moment. Just perfect.
Roman 👌👌
This segment try to possible Retribution vs Raw vs Smackdown or Retribution vs The Hart Business in Survivor Series 2020
I think I like Ali’s heel turn as leader of Retribution I don’t feel upset about it either
The Hacker said they will pay. This is payback
Lol So far the WWE’s “best” story line of the the year isn’t due to the booking creativity. It’s basically identical to AEW’s booking of The Dark Order. A group that has a few stand out members with an army of unknown masked minions that has been taking orders by an unexpected leader. Even his hand gesture at the end with the open palm, only thing different is him closing it into a fist after a few seconds of holding it up. Could be some type of symbolism towards AEW, who’s booking is superiorly better than WWE’s. Its like Vince said, “Hey, remember that Dark Order story line that did so well and put Brodie Lee(formerly known as Luke Harper) over? Lets do that and hey, don’t forget the masks and make sure they use the open palm, lets just close it after a sec to take our shot.”
Crazy how he the leader when he smaller than all of them
It should have been Alastair black
Imagine jim ross in the commentary with crowd
Mustafa ali is the perfect example that if vince starts paying attention to the b-grade roaster, then many greats will emerge.
Mustafa nailed it. He looked pure badass. Good move by wwe.
Legit reminds me of the aces and eights from tna 😂🤣
Kama Mustafa Ali...
1:05 WWE needs to start a New Nation of Domination
When I eat my macaroni
This is a quick turn of events 🤯
Jesus, learn to hold a camera steady, cameramen.
We need at least Seth n Roman 2 be the last 2 picks 4 raw n take down retribution new wwe is garbage. I still want them 2 do this n put Lashley n Drew Mcintyre on Smackdown i still dont like retribution im sick of them n the hurt business there both garbage the Shield will always be more dominant even with 2 vs 4 Roman n Seth vs all.
1:09-1:13 Mostly every one is excited for the release of the Batman, but has a new brand new release date of 2022.
I saw Shane Thorne like one of guys in retributioun
Ali is good
I thought it was just Ali
1:20
Finally! Mustafa is getting the respect he deserves!!
who the hell is mustafa ali sounds like a lion king character
*Wrestling Jihad* finally...  Aew rocks
Mustafa Ali is from Pakistan ... And I too 😁
HAHAHAHAHAHA I just saw a fake hit and fake pain LMAO
I lovet Ali....
Sala camera men drink pike shut karata hai.

Im so down with this 🔥🙌🏾
Do piekła pujdziesz
I'm big fan mustfa ali
Ali is my favourite superstar
Esto Es Lo Mejor ❤️
oh my god mustafa ali is leader of retribution😮😮😮😮😮
A match that has 2 people that no one cares about. Ha, ha, ha. Even with Ali as leader, no one really cared. That’s why the idea is being scrapped. Another wasted idea and lame bit of writing form the worst writing team in the business. Way to fall from grace with bad writing and even worse wrestling, WWE
Mustafa Ali as best
WWE should consider getting Bo Dallas join Retribution or send him to NXT
Hi
Out of all factions WWE has to out The Red Hot Hurt Business as the Retributions beat down clowns. Bravo Vince
Ali smile = badass
Ali is the leader of retribution i knew it all along because he is the haker that is why that he is the leader of one of the most dangerous groupe of all time called retribution
That "GET EM" was deep bro
Ali, pride of Pakistan 🥰
Turkish power (türk gücü)
Ali man them
Wasted segment :) nice job wwe
Hell yes brother every best opportunity which was taken away from him made him realize that if he wants something he needs to take it by force.  All Hail💯💯
The hurt business: “are you in" Mustafa Ali:“no,I'm busy ruling WWE
Hurt Buisness and Ali in the Ring : We fight them together: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Ali: I talk to ‘em 😌! Hurt Buisness: 😌 Ali turning around with a smile: 😈 Hurt Buisness: 😨😨😨
Hurt business got hurt uce
Best mustafa ali feature wwe champions from Pakistan
You know I would of book this the exact same way
He was one of my suspect Because your remember the    Harker And there        Tearing smackdown apart   As well
WWE... please....  don't screw it.
"T-Bar?" "Mace?" "Slapjack?"  Could these guys have any more generic names? Is this WWE or an NES side-scrolling beat 'em up?
This wwe take on dark order from aew.
The New Members Of Retribution Are Jack Silcock John Jones Ian Bestley And Others
THIS WAS AWESOME
You gotta admit. WWE is getting better
NOBODY NEVER SAW THIS COMING MUSTAFA SAVED THIS STORY LINE BIG TIME IMAGINE WHAT HE WOULD DO AS A HEEL BEST HEEL TURN OF 2020 WELL DONE CREATIVE
Good to c mustafa Ali getting the spotlight
Lol slapjack is my new favorite character
Where’s Cedric? He joined the Hurt Business cause he was sick of getting beaten up every week. I was hoping he was gonna get beat up again by Retribution lol
Do whatever just don't make it seem like some Al Qaeda stuff please!! It's a request!!
Best heel ever in wwe  This is was so awesome  Get him It was great 👍  Ignored people are the most talented one when given a chance
When is Jinder vs ali gonna happen
chsss agae
Retribution:go go go   Big show returns  Retribution:umm guys we need to retreat
There were rumors about roman being in retribution but who would of thought ali would be the leader of the leader of retribution
Who elsewas waiting for heel ali Edit: after all ali was a officer before wwe superstar
The Nexus 2.0?
If retribution make any mess with Seth Rollins. Sure they are going to see the hell
Hurt Business vs Retribution reminds me of The Shield vs Wyatt Family feud.  I just wish they should have been built up strong on a separate story line first before crossing paths. Imagine how the crowd would react.
What a joke😂😂😂 such a small guy leading retribution😂😂😂
Predator gimmick
Fine, I'll play along. Ali is the leader of Retrobu.........no I don't like it.
Can't wait for next episode.I hope they use a Fortune Fighter Ali attire and music from 2k20
Uh... k.
All we need was the OOOOOOOOOOO From the crowd to make this 10000000000000000 times better
so does this mean ali is shockingly a heel?
The look on MVP’s face when he realized Ali was in charge was probably my favorite part.
"Get him!" The start of RETRIBUTION's new leader.
So was he also the hacker during the Mandy and Otis segment
Wait are the Hurt Business still heel? Will this be Heel vs Heel?
Congrats Ali bhai. Full support & 💖 from 🇮🇳
Bruh this makes no sense
I liket it
Ail Was Hacker On Smackdown Was that Mystery’s Man From Video He The One Who’s Behind All This!!!
T-Bar, Slap Jack, Chicken Nugget , Flip Flops, and now Ali ......
I was so shocked. 😯😯. Can't wait for this storyline
I have taken a break from all WWE shows, but I watched this clip because I've been a big fan of Mustafa Ali.  Good for him for getting some spotlight, but holy hell...Kevin Dunn needs to be fired.  So much shaky cam and extreme close ups and cut, cut, cut editing.  It's like this segment was filmed inside a working washing machine that was in a tornado inside an earthquake.  Vertigo city man...
I did not see that coming
I figured and knew that Ali would be part of something suspicious. I've seen it on his face.
Main event fight 🔥🔥🔥 Lots of love to Hurt Business
So glad Ali is finally getting the push he deserves it was long overdue.
💓🥰🥰🥰💓
My favorite is Ali
Ali is tha best
Illuminati
I am big fan of WWE since my childhood. But now WWE is getting boring day by day. Nothing excited me to match WWE
I thought Mustafa Ali was up to something. Especially when he had the whole Smackdown hacker thing. But wow!!!, Ali is The leader of RETRIBUTION.
Ali’s attire doesn’t really suit him being in retribution tbh
'Cause Ali Said So
Cain velasquez also in retribution?
They just gave up on hand signals lol
Retribution is looks like the IMMORTAL ENIMIES IN MAD MAX !
Hurt business vs Retribution gone be a war between them.
Slapjack
When did he get his full name back?
Is anyone else getting NWO vibes or is it just me
Where was t bag in all this ?
Hey they gave him his full name back, he's not just Ali anymore lol
I hate shakey cameras. Get rid of it.
I feel like Ali’s heel rn won’t work that much because we all know that he is way to sweet and kind
El industrial traicionero
الله يسعدك يا  علي مسطف
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤♥️♥️♥️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🤲
I love to see this storyline ,  its getting better and better ,  but man its still a slapjack 😭
Worst moments in wrestling history
Base on d fact DAT d Hurt business has been so annoying lately, I tink d Retribution made my day
I give it like ... 10 min before they blow it lmao
N bobby wanned to fight brock like that hes not ready for brock
1:24 oh my... *GOD!*
survivor series will be fire 🔥🔥
Mustafa ali🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I will honestly says,Ali is future word  champion
Hurt Business Rule, Retribution Drools Like: Hurt Business Comment: Retribution
Mustafa Ali need Title .
As soon as he join or we discovered he was a member his voice changed
Mustafa Ali is the leader retribution
Good Job WWE....... Truly best and unexpected......
You still a jobber Mustafa ali
I can't believe Mustafa Ali is the leader of Retribution. The hacker storyline comes full circle.
I dont know what the retribution is but it looks like a shield remake  Like the lights go of Mask guys come out  Use numbers against their enemy Destroy and leave
So does this mean the hurt business are good guys now
I was in the thunderdome and I was shook!
*So glad that Shredder finally got his WWE debut.*
what next batman vs retribution
# Ali
lol 😆🤣😂😹
My boy Ali
Is just like when waffles go against pancakes and French toast
🇵🇰❤️🇵🇰❤️🇵🇰❤️
❤️❤️❤️
All of a sudden I like Ali now
Finally ali got pushed by wwe
1:13 when you hit your toe on the edge of the bed and it hurts
Watching WWE after 20 Years and I'm like'' Wtf happened to this industry..? Some Co*k Su***r Must've messed with the Time Machine'' lol Such a Waste...
Lowkey a knockoff of aces and eights if yuno
1:14 Me When I heard that I have homework due during a non-school week
It's seem be like Hollywood or Bollywood movie scene 😎😍👌
Love Mustafa Ali
A move that makes so much sense because of the long term story telling that can be told. Mustafa has been cheated out of so many things in the past year: cheated out a WWE Title match, screwed out of MITB 2019, forgotten about in the summer, de-pushed in his chase for the IC Title, kept off tv for months with no reason. The list makes this such a justifiable turn and I’m so happy to see Ali get this chance
Where is drew?
1:14 Mvp Bobby Lashley and Shelton Benjamin reaction is priceless
Omg are you kidding me😱😳
I think chris nolan is gonna sue someone
Ali is love ❤️
a tag team agaisnt them ?
its like the shield sooner they separte
i was still hoping for wade Barrett but I'll take mustafa ali
Mustafa Ali aka Adeel Alam rockkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkksssssssssssssssssssssssss love from Kashmir.................................... big Fan sir............................................  M U S T A F A . . A L I . . R O C K S
great
woooow
By the way where is Cedric
Good game
This is like watching a deleted WWE 12 story mode
Good mostafa ali
Don't screw this storyline vince
i think ali well win becase he is a mulin i like when he do this do you then like ✋👇
Turn heel with crusherweight
What a decion by wwe
I love mustfa ali
weeks ago:cedric alexandre is one of the only superstars that never turned heel next day:he turn heel days ago:ali is one of the only superstars who never turned heel next day:he turn heel
Looks like they got them mask at Walmart lol
They can't repeat the same mistake they did with Nexus. They have to make this right this time. At survivor series make Retribution win the match against team WWE
This is some usual suspects plot twist. Im a fan of ali, but he is the least expected leader of retribution. Hes small, physically weak, has no charisma, weak mic skill, and one of the least intimidating roster, just like kevin spaceys character.
So a bunch of goons,  a payday crew member, bane, predator and Mustafa Ali attack the hurt business? Cool.
Roman reigns fans like... Support me guy's please please 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
Super
this little piece of my life its called happinness
Ali is top trending wrestler in wwe 😍😍
Mostofa ali I like
MVP reaction is priceless 😂
From a person who fought in Main Event shows to Become a Leader of RETRIBUTION
Lol
Commentator:You came out there without any backup! Oh mustafa Ali this is a sad sad mistake... A few seconds later the backup came🤣
Best
Woooo
Imagine if crowd in arena.  Ali will get massive pop...
nonsense
Has anyone noticed that the thunderdome crowd gives better reaction than the actual crowd nowadays
He does deserves the spotlight
Am I supposed to be impressed by a bunch of white boys beating up 3 black guys? What's the point of this?
Pretty much retribution is here to squash hurt business, this is getting boring, a fair 3 on 3 hurt business with the W all day
This makes either the Hurt buisness Anti-Heros or Retribution Anti-Heros which one is it?
Now give him chance to win any title please wwe.
Than you WWE. MUSTAFA ALI is a real leader. Now you got it.
Wtf is that crowd LMAO
Wowwww
Ali was an impostor
This is nice. That voice and that smirk. If he can pull off being a heel then wwe should push him for a title run.
Cm punk to seth rollins to mustafa ali
Get them Accent changed
The mystery man was Mustafa Ali
Türk ler nerdesiniz ses verin
Why would mustafa Ali just joins the RETRIBUCIÓN
Mvp and shelton reaction was priceless , im loving every inch of this... Ali 🥰🥰
The mask is of dean ambrose😂
I always thought it was him, bcz of his mask
Man hopefully we’ll get to see more of Ali for what’s next for him and retribution
i think its makeup see him carefully
Mustafa ali is just a dollar store seth rollins.
Kill the boys
I didn't see this one coming.Mustafa Ali made a surprise attack to the Hurt Business.
Mustafa Ali shows how Pakistan is
Mustafa Ali is a great mood. To come to retribution.

This sucks
Retribution should get championship offer and long time champion like shield undisputed era and drx
Ali As A Retribution Leader Was Good Idea For His Careers 👍
This should have closed Monday Night Raw
Man I hope they push Ali
i love the one from retribution who's mask looks like pretitors faces. I think its T-bone
🔥Mustafa Ali😍
Finally something happen good in wwe after drew victory over Brock lesner
Who's the two Giants names?
Where was the rest of the roster...boring makes no sense
Make  him a champion
I Love Mustafa Ali
🤑
Wawawawawaw
Climax in the Story! Ali 👌👌 I'm with The Retribution
The only people who are wearing mask at wwe ...following rules
Love you Mustafa Ali from Pakistan
love u from pakistan mustafa ali
It's so shocking Mustafa Ali is the leader of the retribution....
super mustafa ali
Rebution more like rebubin
Cm puck
I didn't even know
This was pretty obvious
Apollo and Ricochet be like:We will be Jobbers😭😭
Aakhir isne apne Pakistan ka naam roushan kar hi diya😆😆🥰🥰🥰
Lets not forget about Shane thorne
Thank you wwe best storyline of the year
Hurt Bussiness half face half heel. Im digging it!
I knew it! Ali was kinda sus
The way he changed his voice to say "Get em" 😂
This is awesome
Roman reigns best
Get Em
Still remember the MITB when he was just inches away from winning
perfect heel turn as of right now
So Mustafa Ali is the Imposter I am loving it..He won the game
Mind blowing
Best leader is wade berret
RIP to any theories about Randy or Roman being the leader of Retribution
i like mustafa ali attitued
I dont want to be mustafa ali as a leader of retribution
Shredder and the Foot Clan.
This could be good for him but idk who's side to be on
This gave me goosebumps !!!!
1:04  to  1:16 That's A Meme Right There...
Me:seems like those vids that said ali was apart of retribution was not fake hmm cool i wanted to see this
Booyeah,Mustafa i love you.
can’t believe people waited 2 months for retribution to reveal itself and it’s a bunch of nobody’s and MUSTAFA ALI! like what l, worst thing you could’ve done honestly.
He is not the leader. He is just a part of it.
not reings, not also orton but ali
Jobber to super antiheel ...it took him 2 mins
If this Mad max fury the movies characters😅Retribution 😈
Nice
Viewers: stupid self ali why you looking at retribution like that Ali: directing orders to retribution Viewers: OMG this can't be happening
ooooh..I like that..
Garbage! Keep up the bad work World Wrestling Embarrassment. Retribution is garbage. One guy looks like a Mortal Kombat character, one guy is with a Jason mask and one guy looks like Fiend.    Stop watching wrestling was the best decision I’ve made.
I really miss fans during these Legendary Segments!!!
can’t say I’m not surprised..
When you play “Dark Order” Theme song, it enhances everything
Ali is trash
Only Mustafa Ali know it
Don't mean all the time Ricochet and Apollo Crews had the power to and they did not know it
From 2o5 live to Raw , Ali and Murphy are now part of major storylines . There career will change now
Still can’t take retribution seriously . Anyone else
Mustafa Ali is damn good
Wow that's awesome
Why? Why, Mustafa? Why would you form RETRIBUTION and become leader? Why?
excellent.maybe switch up the Jamaicans mask into war paint and do away with Dijaks weird mask too; turn them Towers into a tag team
Ali finally getting noticed...
Has everyone going nuts first ail and then the young bucks in aew
Hajjajsbajahsjhahahhahahah cringe.
Wow! I never would have guessed that Mustafa Ali was the leader of Retribution. Now the only question is why?
Ohh...
Am getting back into WWE because of Retribution. My boy DIO deserves this push.
WWE so far you have done the right thing.  Please just don't screw this up as always 😀
This Show is so awefull
he was the leader all this time
Is This like a heel campaign it started from bayley and now this
Now this was really a cool moment, props to WWE for pulling this off
Whatever, imma get my cheese fries
Whyyyyy Mustafa Ali, whyyyyy
A pale imitation of the nWo.
I don’t know if this was planned or they (more likely) stumbled into it, but Ali may be able to help this version of The Titanic avoid the iceberg. And if he does put the strap on him.
I thought it was Roman Reigns who was the leader at first
I sure hope WWE gives Ali the push that he rightly deserves this time around I dont blame him one bit for what hes doing with retribution sometimes you have to jack a few jaws to get your point across to people it's very very hard to get a push in any wrestling company look at Kofi Kingston it took him eleven years to win his first wwe world title
Retribution got Casey Jones, Bane, Alien v Predator, and Iron Man leading the pack.
What about Apollo and ricochet
:/ CALL THE GOD DAMN COPS
Wow
I didn't see that coming. I never would've guessed that Mustafa Ali was the leader of Retribution. It kind of reminded me when Bully Ray revealed that he was the leader of the Aces and Eights in Impact Wrestling.
er... weird flex, but ok
So he has a first name again? Does Murphy have a chance?
Thanks so much we i.  Love you guys hope you guys have a good day today
I so did not see that coming.
I love Biryani 😍😍😁😁
Banda sahi khel gya.
Never Thought he would turn heel like this.
Oh my God I got chills💯💯 Loved every single bit of this episode especially this part it was actually pretty interesting and the best moments of wwe history not gonna lie. Wish to see this fresh talent Mustafa Ali reach the peak just like Roman, Seth and Dean.  Love & Peace out y'all ✌️💯🕊️ This was the best Raw episode of 2020, maybe since the beginning of WWE.
Hell yea boy
Retribution Members: Best: Mace AKA Dio Maddin Worst: Slapjack AKA Shane Throne
It makes sense he never got a big push
I feel like Retribution could have been a cool story line based around the MOntreal Screw Job....Canadian wrestlers (even ones from the Hart Family) coming after WWE for what they did to bret hart years ago. And their first victims should be HBK, Triple H with Vince being the last one. They keep talking about it, why not base a storyline around it.
What a shocking turn-of-events on Raw.
Slapjack is my fav!
So Ali had won ......didn't know .....thats pretty good love RETRIBUTION
Why would  Ali do this though
At video time 1:57 predator movie alien 👽 also join retribution and fighting with lashley 🤭
Who is supposed to be the “heels” in this situation???
Se que no me entenderán pero seth rolins tiene que irse es un idiota por hacer lo que hizo a rey misterio y su hijo
Never seen it coming
Ali is now known as backstabber.
Ali is a weak leader. It should have been Lars Sulivan.
That was so cool!!! I hope his Mic skills further this moment!!!
I don't believe mustafa Ali is leader
Plz last more than 2 weeks this is amazing
It's like pissing off the quiet kid in school not knowing he's about that life.
I was definitely surprised. I feel like there was better options but can’t wait to see how this turns out. Us title match?
Mustafa Ali should have a finisher like a super kick, black mass or like adam cole's last shot. If he is able to find one such finisher, he would become a big star like shawn micheals.
Mustafa Ali 😍❤😍
That is so good
Out of everyone ALI WHYYY
Finally same things better for ali
Wow this what i was looking for
Hope mustafa ali gets a major push after this. But how he is revealed to be the leader of retribution. IT WAS AWESOME!
Hey
Mustafa Ali is the leader of Retribution
The thumbnails are a spoiler
el niembro de retribución el de la portada es r ut porque tiene rastas
I cant believe it
Ali seriously     what disappointment
I did not see that coming that should have been at summerslam your never see it coming
Is mercedes possibly being out of retribution a good thing or a bad thing I mean it could put her in main roster limbo like chelsea green and Vanessa borne
The nexus reborn.. *yawn* there’s Jason and a guy who looks like bane. Sigh
This should have ended the showww Amazingg
Nothing but a version of the dark order from AEW
Wait.........WHAT!!!!!!!!!😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Mustafa was sus!
I like this dude's theme but that theme doesn't suit a heel, definitely not the leader of a faction. I hope they have a better heel theme for him.
Congratulations Mustofa ali 🇧🇩🇵🇰🇧🇩🇵🇰
So bane joined wwe
As long as Vince doesn’t turn them in to a stereotypical Middle Eastern faction I’m all for this and the potential for Ali to elevate.
Nw Monday night raw is Ali yard🔥❤️
Stop it, I like it 😍
Finally Mustafa gets some recognition, now he needs to win a title.
🇵🇰💪🇵🇰💪🇵🇰💪🇵🇰
This is good man.
Xxxkrkc
Who do you think is more dangerous The fiend or retribution
Anyone remember Muhammad Hassan?
I know camera didn´t point at legs but is actually Mustafa turned heel on heel?
What a kids show official now, getting hype up over a script story with over acting jobbers
So shocking
Shane Thorne is the 3 rd member
The light of WWE Mustafa Ali is big further in WWE
People who still thinks that hockey mask cosplay is Jason voorhees, but I'm sorry to say that's Casey Jones from Teenage mutant Ninja turtles...
GRANDE MUSTAFA ALI
Elsworth VS Maverick dream match😂
People who love wwe subscribe to me too
Mustafa Ali better drop a killer promo after this !
The light of WWE Mustafa Ali is big futher of WWE is best  decision to WWE for good booking not bad booking Ali is next Roman reigns and Mikey foly is big WWE Ali
Yup Mustafa Deserve that🖤
🤔 So, wait? He wasn’t the one behind all those other attacks in the past few months, has he?
Ali is best
I am big fan of The light of WWE Mustafa Ali
The ending was lit🖤
I know that's T-BAR as Dominik Dijakovic, MACE as Dio Maddin & SLAPJACK as Shane Thorne with Mustafa Ali & RETRIBUTION on Raw!
But i still dont like their face masks...
Weres kane and undertaker when u need them
Ali ali ali
We can't believe Mustafa ali is leader of retribution
I love Mustafa Ali
I love Mustafa Ali
I love Mustafa Ali
I love Mustafa Ali
Also Cedric was missing so revelation
Was that ricochet and apollo in the Hoodie?
👍
Bane, predator, slasher
1:07 one of them looks like jon moxley
I gussed some time before that perhaps Ali could be leader of retribution and i m right. I know very well that as a retribution leader mustafa will be on top of career. He know how to lead and carry the mates. And retribution making storylines more interesting😀😀.
The best decision wwe
Wwe Mustafa Ali world titles matireal
I actualy enjoying this storyline
Really Hero
Modern day muhhamed Hassan
Mmmm idk man but the storylines are becoming stale
Its almost feels like real 🤣
Oustanding segment wwe 🥰
Good
See the refree he just ran away
Fans last week: Retribution is sooooo stupid. Fans THIS week: 😳😮
Looks at this dark order knock off group 😂😂😂
Plot twist: slapjacks the real leader
All that random destruction and boring promos for this?
Ali  super 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘🥰🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘🥰👌👌👌
I knew it was gonna be Mustafa Ali who's the leader of retribution as well
OMG
I think in  these guys  we will see daba katto too

Fun fact: This YouTube video has more views than the entire RAW show
He sacrifice my life for Pakistan
Yoyo Mustafa Ali in the action Pakistan zindabad
I'm in HURT BUSINESS
Top Stables 1 Bullet Club  2 The Elite 3 Suzuki-Gun 4 The New Day 5 Undisputed ERA 6 The Inner Circle ......      100. (Last) Retribution
Mustfa Ali needs Championship ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Isn’t ricochet and Apollo crews in a lil group with Ali?will they become retribution as well?
Bobby lashely go back to TNA aka IMPACT WRESTLING man
Mustafa Ali is the best WWE superstar he deserves this push and will become the next WWE champion.Thanks to Mr.Vince Mcmohan for this push and I know he will make him a champion
Ratings were the lowest 1.6 after this.. I don't know why
OMG Ali on fire 🔥 👌
PLEASE add Titus O'Neil to The Hurt Business.  He is too big and strong and too good of a guy outside WWE to leave on the shelf.
Really who care ?
Best thing happened in wwe 2020
I dont expect this from you Ali you broke my heart😔😔😔😔
Kya chutiyapa hai yeh
What a scripted drama 🤣🤣🤣
So what he's a heel now?
I can,t believe someone I like is with retribution 😱
Match set for surviovor series  RETRIBUTION   VS    HURT BUSINESS                       THANKS FOR 0 LIKES 👍 😀                  PLZ LIKE 😢
Please learn from past mistakes, and don't let this be another Nexus...
I think Vince McMahon is is giving a big push to Mustafa Ali to becoming a retribution leader
I really wish ali wins any tittle he deserves a lot
I love you mustafa ali 😎😍😍😎
Can we just appreciate how the hurt business fought against the retribution as they are the only one doing most of the fight against them
Ali 😗💚
A
I wanted a megastar to lead Retribution
Wwe🕴️📢📢📢💪👏
I LOVE HOW EVERYONE LOVES THIS UNANIMOUSLY
Top 10 Anime Plot Twists of All Time
The rumours where fake CM PUNK is not the leader
Finely WWE utilize mustafa Ali talent..
Get em!
I feel like this should lead to Mustafa Ali vs Kofi when he gets back from injury. Mustafa feels like Kofi got "the light" he should have gotten and now he wants RETRIBUTION. If they do this that's some loooonnng term story telling lol
Finally Mustafa Ali is where he should be long before!
He is a leader. He deserves to be.
I love it
Damn that was beautiful
How come WWE is putting up better storylines and feuds when there's no fans? They should've done this kind of stuff before covid 😂
OMG Ali is the retribution leader I can't believe this
Wow.. finally Ali is getting spotlight he rightfully deserves
Sorry but I might have to switch to see if this is gonna happen
I like soo much Mustafa Ali turn heel and him is the leader of the Retribution this is amazing for him and for the Retribution 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
When a toothpick Is the leader of a drug-induced gang
no one knows i am also one of them
I am loving 🥰 it
Wheres Cedric Alexander hes in too
Mustafa Alli i like you,, ❤❤
.........SLAPJACK 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
The hacker is back with retribution
😂😂🤣🤣🤣see the face of boby lasley changing mind Mustafa ali
imagine there is 1 more leader of retribution but in smackdown..
I like ali, but it's😑
Awesome decision in decade wwe history
This is A Waste of Time😂. Retribution 👎🤣. This might be the worst Stable I've saw Since Right To Censor
RETRIBUTION IS NOTHING IN FRONT OF LEGEND KILLER🔥.ONE AND ONLY ORTON CAN DESTROY RETRIBUTION ALONE🔥.
3:01 song name
Tolong promosikan cenal sya
Aizen level heel turn......
1:13 Mace
this clip just proves that wwe just uses voice effects instead of the "crowd" doing the booing etc.
Retribution from being cringe..to awesome
MY GOD!! GET HIM...IT WAS LIT🔥🔥
Cm punk is the leader 🤗🤗
If fans were there it would have been a lot better
Ali is a jobber!!!!
The time is coming soon in wwe when u will hardly find a face🤓🤓🤓 superstar. List this
Why was mustafa Ali the leader of retribution
Dio Maddin looks the most menacing outta the group lol jeez 🔥🔥
RETRIBUTION is nothing more than WWE’s lame attempt at Aces & Eights. Who’s running creative in WWE? They need to reevaluate whoever is in that position.
MARSTFIA ALI RETRIBUTION FRÈRE REMI GOFFLO
Finally we can see the real potential of Mustafa Ali.
Who’s slapjack and who’s mace
Indo mana suaranya
Mustafa ali is talented wrestler and deserve push.
I love ali my fevrt player...
This was the best thing Ali had to deal with this fools🔥🔥
We want dean back
Waoo
😂😂m not gonna buy it😂😂
I proud of u Mustafa Ali he is muslim i like u dear love from pakistan
Not funny
After seeing this video  Me: Bhaisab kuch jada nahi ho gaya ye matlab kuch bhi ????😪😪😔😔
Look closely.! Retribution gang, each one mimicking Big bad masked guy from famous movies like Predator, Bane (Bat man), Mad Max.
Okay who else thought it was Roman lol
Wack
Superb 👊 Ali ❤️💪💯
Push Ali!!!
Wwe is getting worse day by day....
Nice 👍
I like this one
From a storyline purpose, this makes TONS of sense.   Think about it:   He got screwed out of a WWE Title opportunity last year.  He's much better than WWE gives him ANY kind of credit for.  He's not gotten many opportunities.   Makes perfect sense.
MVP reaction was priceless
Wow it has 1.6m views 👏👏👏
I love mustofa the best😍
Dio Maddin legit looks scary
Roman reigns gone to bad know he had to come with mustufa Ali in retribution.wwe should change the manager of roman reigns
Yep I knew it was either Ali or Triple H that would be revealed as the retribution leader Ali does make a lot of sense he was taken off of TV for a long time when the hacker storyline was cancelled Ali was brought to Monday Night Raw and retribution is only on raw now because of Ali Ali should tell everyone on a up coming Monday night raw that hes the Smackdown mystery hacker too itll be revealed somehow that he was the mystery hacker too
Biggest swerve in WWE in quite some time
So aew dark order is here in wwe
this is so boring and tasteless by wwe. I don't get the point of retribution at all, seems like they wanna do a shield/nexus type thing
This was a terrible story line that just became magical. Ali deserves the push.
The Prince mustafa Ali is believe that....,
turkum lannn mustafa alı sevıyorum senı
No Matter Ali Is Face Or Heel He Deserve Cheers And WWE CHAMPIONSHIP On His Shoulder
Damn Ali save retribution I like it 🔥
Dio Madden finally got a gimmick.
I miss the crowd so much. Damn covid
Now this... is what ive been waiting for
In 90's: ohh wwe i love it In 2020: ohhh wwe daily drama
Shelton Benjamin’s like huh?? 😂😂😂😂
That knee drop did not connect
WTF happened to Cedric??
so Jason Vorhees, the Predator and Bane in Retribution? Has WWE run out of ideas?
This made me change my whole mind about retribution
Awesome to see Ali is finally getting the spotlight ⭐
Really??  Mustafa Ali is retributions leader?? SMH 😒😒
I was a huge fan of ali and now I am die heart fan of Mustafa Ali 😍😍😍😍🔥🔥
IM SHOOK
Noooo
Cringey
Uzbelar bormi bitta likke bosinglar
Ali is awesome
The shield vs Retribution who will win 😎
Français ?
I love this man ❤❤🇸🇴
They need to ease up with the camera zooms
Welcome back mustafa ali
Future of WWE Ali
mustafa ali love from pakistan
I watched it almost 100 times... Best part of Monday night raw.. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ali is the worthy heel to dethrone my man Drew
1:31 instead of "to attack" he could have said "to hurt" the hurt business 😂
I wonder if this is how they’ll tie Ali to the hacker gimmick they had set up for him before COVID. It would explain how retribution was able to get into the the control system.
Good job ali
so is ali heel now
Loved the transition between heels and faces
damnnnn this is awesome
who is ali? he's two feet tall! why would these giants listen to him for?
I remember some dude calling this out weeks ago
Ali 🔥 🔥 🔥
The only thing wrong with this segment are the names of the goons
If vegeta had full control of the Ginyu Force
I love must fa ali
Mustafa is tiny compared to the rest of them!
Now the connect the Hacker gimmick to this
Get him a new look - He'll be a main eventer with Retribution!
Why this is not in main event 🔥🔥
Good for Ali change from nothing character
we have another Jesus? ok so he's the Muslim Jesus?
all i see is predator, bane and jason voorhees attacking the HB
This is like muhammed Hassan’s storyline in I think 2006
It will be funny if these factions split up on wwe draft day
Slowly gaining potential to be better than the old days of TNA and the whole Aces and Eights time
One of the retribution is like keigh lee
Retribution Vs Nexus
O CORAÇÃO DA WWE
after all he's from pakistan so terrori... oh leave it be, i will look like racist if say this
O yeahhhhhhhh
When he said "get them", I literally shouted wwwwwwhhhhhaaattt ttttthhheeee ffffffuuuuccccc!!!!!
So glad mustasfa Ali is the leader of retribution rather than slapjack
The Leader should have been keith lee or Roman reigns after the draft
🤣🤣am I the only one who thinks ali doesn't make a good heel..he looks like he gon turn good immediately
1:07  its BANE ITS BANE
I'm not as sold on the group, but I'd be lying if I said this isn't the first genuine eye opener on Raw for some time.
The hacker should have been revealed as the leader of retribution . Then Ali should have been revealed as the hacker.
This was so well executed 💯💯
Mustafa is looking good
BU ADAM TÜRK
Must a fa Ali next wwe champions just like iron sheik
Retribution is NXT Wrestler
ali ❣️
Ok
Eh
So happy to see Mustafa Ali getting the chance to shine :D
When the silent kid in the class had enough so he calls his big brother's frnds.....
Omg 😱😱😱
Well WrestleTalk is still gonna criticise this!! Sometimes I wonder they hate it because they genuinely don't like any of the stuff or they hate it because they want to!
*Get Him* He nailed it!
Cm punk leader of rtrbtn
But Retribution's leader looks Weak Was Barret was strongest from Nexus, doesn't matter there was Punk
Thank U WWE For Giving Us The Leader Ali

This is a good fit for Ali. I'm super happy for him . epic heel turn👊🏿☝🏾
Mustafa Ali, T-Bore Is Domanic Diajocovic, The Skull Mask Man With A Tattoos is Shan Thorn, and Of course Mia Yim, Another Girl Is Mercedes Martinez, All Superstars From NXT Roster.
Seth rollins should also be part of retribution, i would like to see seth vs ali winner to have retribution
RIP EYES! That camera work was nauseating.. how was i ever used to that camera movement
I love the mustafa push
Was that the Predator?
BRUH what i knew this already wht typa hiding are yall doing this is sad
Who ever messes with Mustafa Ali is gonna get. Retrobtion
This is the first time in years I'm genuinely excited for next weeks Monday night raw.
Disgusting behavior
Retribution 🖤🔥
NEXUS THE SHIELD UNDISPUTED ERA RETRIBUTION yes. yes..yesssss!!!!
Join the Dark Order AEW
This should've been the ending of last night's Raw
Well persecution friend with the fee on the scene power than
Ali of all people i mean the leader of retribution He us half their size and doesn't have a Heel Persona Worst Decision ever by WWE and Vince
Can the camera man do his job and not shake the damn thang lmao
Wait so is Mustafa Ali a face?given that hurt business is a heel group,and Cedric who was Ali’s partner turned heel to join the hurt business.
Maaaaaaan een mvp kame baxk
If Ali ever gets to fight for the title and win it against a major Superstar, I stg I'll get this screened in Pakistan.
Love Pakistan
All,fake video
مصطفي علي 💜💜💜
yup a bit of cringe wouldnt hurt...
What if Ali uses this group to manage his first ever WWE title that would be amazing, would love to see Ali as a New WWE champion!!
It's like  prince of Persia   leading   secret six
Mustafa Ali best times
Ali will always win our❤️🇵🇰 Forever
That's random person who liked my comment 🥺 may you and your parents live more than thousands years
Good
Is the fan noise just audio???
I think seth Rollins should be the leader of retribution
Randy Orton: I Had the Best Heel Turn of 2020 Roman Reigns : Huh?!? Mustafa Ali : Lmao, Hold my light Noobs😎
Lol so wwe is basically copying the dark order.
Whoever wants Ali vs Bobby for us championship like or whoever wants Drew McIntyre vs Ali for wwe championship reply
Love Ali
M ali is a great wrestler
Will don mustafa Ali
Well this was good...But this happened out of the box tho..He was a jobber since his return and now he suddenly becomes the leader wth.. Atleast give us some tease or something..Like they teased with Miz and Roman..It was happened suddenly which kills the momentum to be honest but still I m glad that Ali gets the chance to shine in the limelight.
Notice how WWE has these great storylines but they're trying to drag them out till the fans can come inn just in time for the climax of their storylines, but can't drag it too much... This is why fans need to come back.
Love from ali
retribullshit
Where is Cedric Alexander??
Now they need a great storyline
That's great
Hopefully a great push for ali i think he a be a ok up there
1:13 that sudden look change on mvp lashley and Benjamin face just made me laugh....😂😂😂 BTW I am very impressed with this unexpected leader and....... really what a perfect execution.......👏👏👏  Man I am completely interested in this storyline......
finally wwe heard to their fans...thank you
Wowwwwwwwewwwwwwwww
Everyone were searching for the suspect and Mustafa Ali won the game by becoming an impostor   Just one of those among us things 😂
Ali now growing up
Mustafa ali lowkey played us all 😭
Guys we have to admit. We did NOT see this coming.
Get Him Remember the voice
This is totally unexpected..shocking..cool
Way to Bury them nothing against Ali he’s amazing but
One of the best moment happend in raw for years
Awesome 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Gud segment from wwe......come on ali
Who else  thought roman reigns is leader of retribution .👍👇
Mustafa Ali: "I want to be a superhero for kids because Islamic wrestlers have been portrayed as cliche bad guys for too long"  Also Mustafa Ali: "Becomes leader of a bad guy group"
Hurt businesses faces went from 😃 to 😅😟🥺
If someone has to b the leader it may have been Tomaso Champa, Johnny Gargano or Damien Priest
😭😭😭 All the Expectations washed by Mustafa Ali, I mean common did he even looks like an underling.
Already knew it was gon be Ali cuz the hacker messes with the system just like retribution does with the lights and ik it had a connection 😭💯🔥 but imagine Tyler Reks is back
Ali is back
Proud to be Pakistani Mustafa Ali
Shelton 😫 Mvp 🤢 Lashley 😩 Mustafa ali 👊👊👊 And mi 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳😁😁
i dont really understand what retribution represent, the terror ? 🤔 i hate wwe since they arived ,no story,just bully this is not going well wwe is going down soon
Dark Order knockoff...
I think all WWE superstars should team up and wreck RETRIBUTION
Bane, Jason, and Predator
That's what I call I geek guy revenge
Mustafa wow
Is it just me or you also think there's one heath Slater among those...
Now i support Retribution as Handsome Ali is their leader. ❤❤❤
So the Hacker is linked with Retribution
Nexus is coming
But think if it was dean ambrose who was part of the retribution
since nobody is going to say it I’m going to say it first      *top 10 anime betrayals*
So are retribution good or bad guys?!
This is great
Like✌✌✌✌..Mustafa ali ....
1:14 there face 😂😂😂😂😂 they like is this fool really with them lol
so, who is face? who is heel?
Who taught roman reigns is the leader of retribution!😂
Ngl, I like this and tbh I think retribution can do well as a tweener stable than heel. And Ali is giving me more tweener vibes than heel (he couldve easily attacked crews or ricochet but he didn’t.  Till he does, I’m saying tweener)
RAW is wasting the mid people like Seth's talents and encouraging  newbies like Ali, Murphy and Dom...
Ali is GTA 3 protagonist silent Claude but when he speaks is unknown voice
When he got his full name back???????
well both retribution and hurt business are cool now. I like retribution now I think that patched up nicely. Atleast for the sake of saying they are now a creditable team and act.  Ali is a good leader and has the voice for it as well. He is perfect for the role.
This heel turn makes so sad 😭😢
I can’t wait for next weeks raw. Will Ali explain himself, will Ricochet and Apollo join him, will a brawl end up happening. I mean there are many possibilities.
Can't wait to see more of this storyline!!! Ali deserves more tv time 👍👍👍👍
Such commentary is spoiling everything
Send Roman reigns Vs Brock Lesnar match
I don't see that coming until Ali rolled out the ring and did nothing🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I don't want see WWE. I quit ,musthafa Ali leading retribution 🤣🤣🤣🤣😠😠😠 WWE stupid
Mustafa Ali leads RETRIBUTION?! Didn't see that coming
it's war wonderful
I think new era is going to start
Finaly ali got right direction hi deserve huge push for wwe title
That was pretty awesome, Retribution is that heel squad u would love to watch. and it boils down well to who was the mystery hacker they showed a few weeks back. Mustafa Ali as a leader of a squad with masked man makes it very interesting to watch
Are these idiots supposed to be taken seriously?
*Ali is too short for retribution*
sometimes these commentators take it away for me
These camera shakes are so friggin stupid
Wow this was sooo cool. Especially when Mustafa Ali is revealed as the leader of Retribution. Sooo freaking cool.
WWE has really upped their storyline game
I hope now something good will happen with mustafa Ali
Raw is more interesting
Don't get me wrong this story will be flop in coming days. Ali is a great but Ko would have been a better choice as he looks like a leader .
so Ali's their Brody Lee?
WWE is predictable in its many storylines but not in this one
Finally Ali got what he wants
So what I’m seeing is that wwe made a jobber a leader so here’s my “Spoiler”!!!! This ain’t gonna work lol
Sexy guy.
Just great
Ali best lider
This looks so bad lmaooo
please make this happen next month survivor series the hurt business vs retribution traditional survivor series match
I really love this. But the problem here is this: just months ago there was this news that, Vince McMahon doesn't see anything in Ali, and now they put him as the center of the hottest storyline of the summer. Either wwe is finally pushing Ali, or they are just burying RETRIBUTION more. Anyway, at least Ali is getting tv time.
This was  story was once The Shield story attacking every superstars. I miss them😢
Nyc mustafa ali
The young kid has called his brothers finalpy for bullies
Returbution is just a name  Nexus is emotion ❤😍🌍🙏💪I miss you lot nexus
Your Retribution !!?? 😲
It should have been dolph
Mustafa ali suppoter like this comment ❤
I'm probably very wrong but maybe the hacker lead up to this like he was hacking everything to help them get what they wanted. See you notice how they only starting showing up mostly when Ali wasnt there because he was instructing them to do it.
1:16 That guy who is on left side of Mustafa Ali looks like Bane from The Dark Knight Rises...
Ali best
Yessir love this story line
Leader should be a stronger someone like cm punk or Randy Orton
Kid: mom can we get The Dark Order  Mom: we have The Dark Order at home  The Dark Order at home: Retribution
Wwe: sorry we canceled the smackdown hacker role you were supposed to get.  Here's the leader of retribution role to make up for that
if any one like Mustafa Ali so like this comment
Y todos pensando que era Roman el líder... Y miren quien resultó serlo.  Ta wena la historia :v
Raw ratings will go up with all the great storylines we are facing.
2003: Evolution is a mystery 2020: RETRIBUTION is a mystery
Best heel turn of my favourite one....❤️😎
🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
*COMPUTERS*
Love you this actions
Literally best
Seth would have been leader if he didn't fued with rey so it makes sense for ali to be leader he's seth 2.0
So the hacker is also Mustafa ali
“Nobody cared who I was till I put on the mask”
Hell yeah!
I seriously hope that Retribution will be the most dominant heel group for this era, just like the Million Dollar Team and Ministry of Darkness. Please WWE, don't waste them just like what happened to the Nexus.
Lmao they got what was coming how does it feel hurt business
Falta de creatividad en la WWE, copiar un grupo de otra empresa.🤣🤣🤣🤣. Únete al dark order...✊🏻
now if the crowds were back this would've been a huge pop
Wrestling lost his charm
We thought he is the WWE hacker....maybe?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 The copy of dark order, AEW.. jajajajajajajajajajajaja🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I really don't like retribution but after the inoculation of Mustafa Ali I am interested in Retribution
Cedric, Murphy and Ali.... They are future.... ❤️❤️❤️🔆🔆🔆
Next up Ali with retribution behind and him having a pipe bomb  *chefs kiss*
So we’re just gonna act like there isn’t 4 extra members that we still don’t know ?
Brock Lesnar is needed in such situation.Everyone will get suplex from him.
Ali baba
1:20
Is this gonna tie into the Smackdown hacker storyline?
I cant believe this
WWE narrators, please see this comment is urgent, I need another opportunity to start WWE RAW, you have to have the police, security and fighters throughout the territory and also in the ring so that When Revenge comes, that's where they must fight and arrest them so that WWE RAW is safe without any interruption of fights and conversations, thank you for reading this comment and thank you for your attention.
Y’all this is a good thing for Ali right now he is coming on the show more and Vince has faith in him because he just gave him  a huge boost !
I love it
Ali deserve a lot ❤️
Masha Allah  like  Aii
@1:21
Ali's new look
this could not be more pathetic
Best thing that happened in WWE
Who  would of thought the silent one of the groups thought it would been more like cm punk, Roman reigns,Seth Rollins,Braun strowman,and so more I glad wwe is finally giving him a chance he going to win the championship too much stars in wwe has potential for greatness and they not pushing them sometimes I wonder why they at wwe who does not give care for their potential or any push whatever just because they not Roman reigns or Sahas banks ,aunskua and bayley well can’t wait to see more of retribution storyline and MusFa Ali
When you order predator jason and bane from wish
Ali turning heel was the only option to survive
And I was expecting CM Punk as a leader of retribution after t-bar tweet to cm punk
Ali ❤
Ali for champion
Ali 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Are we going to pretend to ignore the fact that RETRIBUTION is the literally a Bizarro copy of the Dark Order 🧟‍♂️  same hand sign just modified a little 👊
The begining of new era🔥
Bobby was that kid in school who never knew what was going on
This just proves how awesome Ali is. To be able to take a group nobody really liked and make it awesome just with your presence shows us Ali is a main card guy now.
Why does retributions names sound like prison nick names??
Now I know who to support. Ali's been fantastic over some years now but didn't get enough chances. Maybe this is the chance he deserves. WWE please book him well
Ali lookin HOTTTT!!! But Retribution FELL OFF! They are just another wrestling team!
One of the sudden,the best push given to ali Hope,he gets a title opportunity soon. Love from INDIA❤❤
I haven't watched in a while, but lord they are overdoing it with the camera shake for no reason.
At last Mustafa Ali get push ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ali deserve wwe award for great acting
This is the most watched segment of all the videos posted by wwe on the raws telecast... Which proves they are a draw.....
Where was Cedric Alexander? I guess he was taking a week off or could not be on Raw for some other reason.
Was expecting Bane to be the leader but Ali works well!!
Can anyone say "Dark Order" rip offs. When you can beat joinem right Vince.
Hey man mind checking us out ? We're a small channel with some cool wrestling content ! No worries if not though it's all good
Its unbelievable
❤️ Ali
The only time  “numbers” doesnt work for retribution is when Lashley / McIntyre / Lesnar teaming up in the ring .
Ali
People just came here  to see the retribution leader
i really enjoyed this episode of raw in quite some time
1.11 that smile wipes off
i love the way Ali said get him. great delivery
Ali is leader of retribution wow  I am big fan of Mustafa ali ❤️ from India
So what Mustafa ali also the hacker?
Nice push Ali we want Ali championship
Now I’m interested
Survivor Series 2020        WWE VS RETRIBUTION
I'm going to be in the minority here but why would I get excited about Mustafa ali being the leader
The one with long hair looks like predator and the big one looks like bane and small one looks like Jason
Ali was the imposter ....dammm
Stacking match Mustafa ali Greatest ❤
Want Ali as a United States champion
Lol🤣🤣🤣👎👎
Nobody Literally nobody Mustafa Ali retribution leader lel😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ali needs to go back to his country. Stay out of USA
Wtf mustafa ali is leader
A moment of silence for those who thought Miz was the leader
Do u remember Ali was in a mycintyers team to fight against Retribution
Wwe hid this in plain sight wit the promo with that Ali light and no on caught on
Everyone thought it was Roman but no one had said Ali
"Get Him"
Mostafa ali all time best
I am happy for Ali .i saw wwe only for Drew MacIntyre
Retribution has a big raivery on the hurt business
we do not like mustafa ali is the leader of retribution we like Roman is the leader of retribution
Curtis axel is that you? Mmmmmmm
Make waaaaaay for Prince Aliiiiiiiii
😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍
Great!!!! 🔥
I knew it ...that mustafa Ali has mystery behind him
Before this match between Ali vs MVP ,he told them I will face him alone we should have understood that something is going to happen
Finally something  good with ali
We knew it the rumors were true
It's pretty cool how they gave Mustafa Ali a push to his career and it's pretty awesome how he's retribution's leader
*W T F*
Wwe is so lame wtf
Mustafa Ali is doing right he is giving justice to those stars who didn't get a push 👍
Ali is retribution leader
Slapjack.     Ight imma head out
Mustafa Ali 👍👍👌👌👌👌🐯🐯🐯💖 Allah bless you
well i guess the story line is going to be a masked hacker because ali is the raw and smackdown hacker duhhhhh
F
We want punk this is boring
Great power move
Cruiserweight leading a group of big men lol
Mustafa Ali is... Is heel turn?
What ali!!! Help hurt businiss
2:50  NINJA VANISH!!!
When did bane and the predator get wwe contracts??  Lmao this group is a joke!
Only if the crowd was there then OH MY DAYS
Why though , he’s a face , rather have Orton as the leader
Such a talented boy is leader of atrobution
Great script from wwe
Wow:  Ich konnte Retribution zum ersten mal Ernst nehmen.  Mega Auftritt von Ihnen & Ihrem Leader Ali mit dem ich nie und nimmer gerechnet hätte.  Jetzt noch die Originalnamen von den Retributionmitglieder zurückbringen und dann wäre alles perfekt. 👌🏻
I want to see C.M. punk as retribution leader
Mustafa Ali leading Retribution is Cyberpunk 2077 version of Bully Ray being leader of Aces & Eights
The official got outta there real quick!!!  😆
I've been waiting for this video 🙂😐
All ll im saying is that Mustafa ali is getting a push
@2:23 Run Hurt Business run!!! Oh too late.
I bet HHH is sitting at nXt just shaking his head at retribution. Why use the hurt buisness to put retribution over the hurt buisness was the best thing about raw
Crazy that is actually good for Mustafa Ali
🌟👹🌟🤭🌟🤡🌟🙈Ali 🤩😎ok 👌
🤨😳👍😂😂😂😂🌟😉👌ok 😎Ali love ❤💖💖💖❤❤
They breathing all heavy at the end 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
MVP is the leader of a group with no name  Ali is the leader of the retribution
ahahah fake cm punk ahahhaah
Jis kisi ko 5k subscribe chahiye to mere photo Ko touch karo aur mere channel Ko subscribe karo support do support lo 😉❤️
We knew it was gonna be a Chicagoan
Who else thought the leader was roman reigns
سلام مسابقه قشنگی نبود
Wwe should rehire Gangreal Pls People doesn't know the brood yet but We want Gangreal
Good Job Ali
Ali being the leader of the Retribution, makes the storyline interesting.
Segments like this makes me wish the fans were there.
This is actually brilliant
A former police now leads an Antifa group
Bobby,Apollo,Cedric, Benjamin and MVP This woul be the greatest version of Hurt business.🙄
Just said that on Facebook that he was with them and was the leader
I like how MVP goes from "atta boy. That's the spirit. Bring the fight to them" to "Oh S*IT".
Tom Philips almost said the f word 1:01
That’s a turn of events
Weeks of literally nothing and embarrassing segments Ali says get him and it’s great storytelling now 😂😂😂 gtfo
So garbage
Not going to lie I didn’t see that coming but I’m finally glad to see ALI in a big storyline
I love Mustafa Ali
I love Mustafa Ali
Lol not suitable 😂
my theory is Boa is behind all this Retribution thing
I just came to say why wont all open up hell in a cell on wwe network
so I take it *Mustafa* was the hacker.. but *LASHLEY* is a one man gang 👀
The 3 Hershey’s got beat up
After being a underachiever he's suddenly a heel? ..
I LOVE the fact that Mustafa Ali gets be the leader of 'Retribution'.  The facial expresions that both Mustafa Ali & MVP delivered was GOLD!!!  It's going to be interesting to see what happens to Ricochet & Apollo Cruise next week.  Maybe Mustafa Ali will allow them to "Join Retribution"?
Shelton's head nod had me rollin
Looks like the Hurt Business is gonna be put Outta Business.  And I see Keith Lee beating Lashley for the US Belt.
Why is M.V.P.'s scream so funny
But where Cedric Alexander is?
OMG I cant believe that but come on its kinda obvious because retribution has been attacking the hurt business and Mustafa ali needed his revenge soo there it is the revenge
This is the only reason I love Retribution now!
we support Mustafa Ali ..... because he is Pakistani. .... 😍😍😍😍😍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
😎😎😎👍👍👍
The angle is saved!
This is the best thing on Raw right now 🔥
That was awesome 😎
Ok I now love Retribution. Great work WWE
I'm loving this...
Retribution is a completely  lame Nexus ripoff. The only good thing about it so far has been Ali. What's even better is when they aren't actually on the show at all. Move along on this fast. Its making RAW unwatchable. More so than it already is.
I bet mustafa ali plan everything to take out hurt business maybe he should let his group team up with him and retribution  to take out hurt business
😊जो सुंदर आंखें👀 यह कमेंट पढ़ रही है भगवान से प्राथना 🙏🙏🙏है कि 🙋‍♀उसके और उसके 🙋‍♀माता-पिता के लंबी उम्र हो जाए 💯💯💯।!!! 💐🌺🌻🥀🌹💞💕💖🌹  🇮🇳 *Jai Hind* 🇮🇳🙋‍♀🇮🇳 *Jai Bharat* 🇮🇳
wow it was ali everybody was saying is triple h but no is ali the guy did never win a match (WWE DO SOMETHINK TO STOP THE RETRIBUTION and ali)
WE Mustafa Ali ON FOX  GOD JOB
I really hope Vince doesn’t messed Ali and retribution storyline
He's the leader? His real name's Alam.
the hurt business is a great staple and theyre ruinning it. as always. losing matches every week, not doing nothing impressive. cheating. wow wwe writers are so dumb. they know how to ruin great stables as always. except of course the shield who was godly praised to Jesus status.
The most ironic thing about this is that a *former police officer* encouraged acts of *vandalism.*
MVP's expression made things better
Mustafa was ALI
MVP was laughing when Mustafa alone went to the retribution but surprised again when he saw the twist......
How does wwe pay so many wrestlers?
It dates back to *The Hacker* and the obvious *Ali* symbol on the computer monitor that *SmackDown* night 😂
The way he said “Get him!” He’s not Mustafa Ali at all. It’s just priceless!
Hell yeah
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
It's just amazing because its a time for ali waiting for next week raw
Oh yeah. Do you love me? 😍💋 💝💖❤️
Haha bane and predator wrecking the hurt business
Weak.
Lo mejor que pudieron hacer en mucho tiempo, ojalá este push para Mustafa sea definitivo y no para después de esto ser enterrado por la pala de turno.
Wwe please turn this retribution storyline gold by continuing Mustafa Ali’s dominance and delivery!
Can't help but think of how J.R. and King would have called this. Nevertheless, amazing.
About time something positive was done with Ali.
0:40 "oh no!" 😂
I like it mustafa ali bro
I just hope Vince keeps Mustafa's own entrance and theme, his entrance is so fire, the crowd actually responds to it with a lot of cheers and props
EPIC PUSH TO MUSTAFA
1:14 EN ESE MOMENTO MVP SINTIO EL VERDADERO TEMOR
I was stock to see what happened at the end  but Ali was the main leader after all he play that role well wow
Mcm  x kne je ali ni lead retibution.. cri la wrestler yg kuat2 ckit..
this is good, Mustafa Ali is very talented
Turn heel
Let me know you something We will see ricochet and apollo in hurt business too
Ali looks like Drake Maverick leading AOP
No that's my boy Ali this not you
2:42 It's me MVP! It was me all along
I'm not saying it was not interesting but we saw it a few years ago remember the Nexus it's the same but I just hope it was not the same thing that after some time there was a redemption vs wwe because it was dumb
Do you know the reason why Mustafa Ali is the leader of Retribution. Think about it, he's been screwed out of a WWE championship opportunity, TWICE!!! I don't like the guy, but I can't blame him for what he did. I would have done the same thing if I were in his shoes. If I felt like I was being mistreated, I would have created a group to destroy the same company that screwed me over. You see, CM Punk would have been a great leader for Retribution (if he didn't fail the New NEXUS) only because I knew what Vince did to screw CM Punk, ON HIS OWN WEDDING DAY FOR GOD SAKES!!!! That would be a great reason for why he would want Retribution, and BY GOD, I would have been by his side from the outside.
Retribution = copy of DARK ORDER.... fakers
Bobby Lashley is a beast
Hmmm.
BS after BS... I don't understand how much more you fans can take haha
Number 40 on trending
wow wow just wow amazing wwe is awsome
Asslam alqum Mustafa Ali great job good luck Allah bless you always In Sha Allah
Ali is a perfect leader for retribution.
Wow
i had no idea ali was going to this
The Ascension
Ali is an awesome leader, he will make retribution a better team, ali the best
how cares this jobber😂
I'm just in shock of what just happened to ali 😯😯😯😯😲😲
Im just glad Ali is the leader.
wwe why ali?
This is brilliant !!
Mustafa Ali getting a massive role and possibly Tuesday into a star.  I'm definitely all for it.
Only supporting this cause of Mustafa
"Get 'em!"
I pay attention to this AEW and NHL
Why aren't you guys going with the hacker storyline to
I cant wait to see how Ali plays this.
Ali's hair is commercial worthy haha
So, last week, everyone was thinking that Retribution was a joke and now that we know that Ali is the leader, that group is cool?  Give me a break... WWE fans, I swear...
Imma tell you this Bobby lashley is gonna make it to Hollywood and he is gonna be among one of the most sexiest superstars to make name for himself!
So Who are the bad guys? I’m so confused
2 heel factions fighting each other?
Good with upcoming draft.  Do a storyline hack of the draft so Retribution gets drafted to Raw.  I would add Jinder Mahal to Retribution.  So it looks like Retribution has the money to do whatever they want.
"Hello nice to meet you, my name is slapjack"
We proud of you Mustafa Ali 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Lol this is  good
that gallo and anderson
Ali deserves this push wwe pushed him further that i expected
Amazing how quickly public opinion on RETRIBUTION has changed in just a few hours.
WWE better stay Strong like this
If ya listen to the commentary at the beginning, they literally spoiled this...     Talking about Ali being alone etc was stupid.   Shouldn’t have mentioned it.
Oh hell yes
ALI WHY!!!!!
1:17 That's a face I couldn't take seriously 😂😂😂😂
The look on the hurt business face 😂
Mustafa Ali is the next megastar in the making. Who agrees?
Mustafa ali Pakistani 🇵🇰 lion 🦁
r truth would be a better leader 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Glad to see Whoopi Goldberg found work again.
Get em......love it 👌
*fans last week* : "tHeReS nO wAy tHeY cAn mAkE tHeM iNteREsTiNg aGAin"  *fans this week* : "ALI IS THE LEADER OMG THIS JUST GOT INTERESTING"
What is the  Face version of Retribution gonna be called? Distribution? Pollution?
Authority vs Retribution?
I knew something was up when mustafa went into the hurt business locker room but i didn't know what it was and i didn't expect him to be the leader of retribution
I had a feeling mustafa  was gonna turn with the hurt business but he did it with a team that was laughed at. Good way to try and start retribution hype back up
RetributioNexus.
Türkiye Cumhuriyeti
Retribution: THIS IS Retribution  Me: ur not good it’s litterly a three on 20 LOL
1:14 the way Shelton drops his head has me dead!
I like Ali and respect his talent but I think they could’ve gone another direction with this
For the first time in a long time, I actually look forward to Monday Night RAW.
Ali...wow.  well so glad I haven't watched in a couple years storylines are so great pffffft
Pakistanis ❤
Pakistanis ❤
Can you imagine the pop if fans were in the arena
Ali deserves this, good storyline WWE
Nice 💪
Mace looks like a mixture of Predator and Jack Sparrow :D
I love this
Love you too much Mustafa Ali
This makes so much sense but  i hope this is Ali's proper chance to rise to the top and wwe doesn't stop this push. He is going to do so well
Will it be Retrubition with Ali vs hurt business cedric/crews/ricochet or would crews and ricochet join ali?
So is Mia Yim and Martinez still a part of Retribution?
Ali looks like Anwar Jibawi
What the heck I always wanted to know this
MVP sold that so well I almost think he wasn't told ahead of time.
Aces and eights...  oops meant retribution  is a really bad gimmick
That's awesome story n characterision for ali
I’m sorry but Dio Madden needs to chill with the weird eyes and faces...
I can’t believe Ali is part of retubtion I want all the wrestlers to get retubution
Ali no longer chasing the light, now HE is the light 😂
This was slow and awkward asf.
This is the exact opposite of Carmella’s return. By that, I mean this was ACTUALLY a surprise
Finally Mustafa Ali getting a proper storyline
That is amazing storyline. I love it
Wooow mustafa ali is in retribution
He nailed it by saying get him
Ali:-WWE is not treating me right I should have been the mystery hacker but the plan is dropped I should leave WWE WWE:- Be the Retribution Leader  Ali:- I am gonna go hard
AYO heel Ali is mad hot 😐
Ok
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Issue is there is no force in fights these days..is wwe really think they can create animosity in fights by waving thier camera!!
Finally they do with ali good job wwe👍👍
Omg I love the character of mustafa Ali
Woooww
Finally, for the first time since 2 months of domination, the WWE reveal the Retribution leader.
Seth Rollins and Murphy..  the hurt bussiness... among us vs fall guys... guys like this right now to be safe. Theres a world war three...
So his story is going to be great he saw everything in WWE as the hacker and he saw was disaster so he formed retribution awesome
Are we supposed to be afraid of a guy named Slap Jack?
Ali Ali Ali
Now things are getting interesting. I didn’t see that coming.
If it is Alister black it's awsomeç
They needed better leader too small
Awesome
You know what would of been awesome? If Kevin Dunn would stop directing these cameramen to shake the cameras so, you know, I can actually SEE what is happening on TV.
Does anyone know why cedric alexander is not appearing recently?
Ali is Real hero

I forgive Mustafa Ali… …FOR STABBING THE WWE IN THE BACK!!!!
One word DEFT!
Ali is their leader? Or is a new member?
WWE should really stop with the title spoilers, like for real
2020 is  AEW >  w w reeee  forever
Look at MVP face when ali turned down, LOL
Azz
😍😍😍
still waiting for takers bell!
Knock off aces and eights storyline
Expectation: The Miz Reality: Ali Aightt!!!
2010 nexus  2020 retribution
They had us in first half, not gonna lie
Okay I like retribution now.... Imagine if Samoa Joe joins, that'd be badass & a curveball!!!  👀
WWE shows that Ali is the head of retribution but it was a joke because Ali is the member of retribution not head. WWE twisted this thing and head of retribution is another person...
The Shield Needs to return and attack these guys
In my personal opinion, this is the greatest heel turn in the modern era
wow team super bro
I don't know about you guys but SLAPJACK sounds really intimidating :o lmao
Look Mustafa Ali is the leader of the Dark Order,... er, I mean Retribution.
I’m so glad it’s him !!! Mustafa is one of the smoothest best wrestlers I’ve seen ! I want him to get a big push if you sore his work in 205 live you’ll know why he’s amazing
Mustafa Ali great leader
Ali's acting is so corny
LMAO THIS GOTTA BE JOKE THIS VANILLA MIDGETS IS THE LEADER
1:05 2019 1:14 2020
it shouldve been roman as the leader
205 runs the raw
Ali in retribution 😂😂😂 joke of the day by wwe 😂😂😂
Mustufa ali pr powar he
If some legit heel superstar like rko, brawn, had been the leader i would have more happy than mustafa
Ali is... is heel turn?
NEW NEXUS ROLE
I'm stunned. Those who are surprised on seeing ali as the leader of retribution, press like  👇
I was expecting CM Punk but okay
Hey, I want to ask one question. Where's bump 100?
The Hurt Business got hurt last night by Retribution!
This was a great move by WWE !!! 🔥🔥🔥
if only we got Feast Your Eyes back
I need NEXUS back!
ALI-DER ❤
I'm still waiting on British Strong Style come back as heel also
Is that Kabal from Mortal Kombat?!
Love him
How could you done this, Mustafa Ali? How could you lead Retribution to do this?
Dude I guessed this before I fell asleep while watching the show... wish it would start earlier in the west coast
I didnt wait that but it doesnt like me :(
NOW I'm a fan of Mustafa Ali XD
Is one member in asencion
greatest heel turn  of the year goes to ali
Top 10 Anime plot twist
wtf was that 🤣🤣🤣
This must be the highest number of views in a 24 hr period of a Monday night RAW clip on Youtube in recent years
This is stupid.  Yeah, I said it.
Lol work on stories plz
Seems i was wrong :/
GET 'EM 😎 daaang delivery on point!
Why ali why... i tought you were a good person....
ohh... well... this is interesting
From not winning cruiserweight championship in WrestleMania To eliminated by nia jax from rumble To replaced by kofi Kingston in chamber match To missed the opportunity for Wwe championship match in WrestleMania To inches away from winning MITB briefcase. .....Man, It makes 100% sense All hail for Leader of Retribution  Edit: [ 600 Likes!! BAH GAWD] THANKS.
Mustafa Ali vs Adam Cole will be a great feud to watch in the future.
Mustafa Ali real talent ❣️🥰
Glad to see Ali as retribution leader 😍😍♥️
Great storyline😎
Nomames mustafa fue el que revelo
Ali is trash
OMG! 🔥
All in the script for WWE
Yess😍🔥❤️
H
The rest of the 205 guys are like thats what i want 🤣🤣
Guy who looks like Seth Rollins is the leader of the Outlaws, who wears black full clothings and beat the hell out of the roster... That's the shield expansion pack for ya...
MVP’s smile was golden The feeling that he thought mustafa Ali was going to beat them up, kinda makes me sad
op orginal boss is hare
Ali joined the hurt business for 20 seconds, only to be revealed as the leader of The Retribution... Nice storyline...
1:20 the way he says get them creeps me out
Hello, everyone! I'm here to share testimony about the wonderful and most safe cure for HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS (HSV-2). I was positive to the deadly virus called HERPES and i lost hope because i was out cased and rejected even by my closet friends. i searched on-line to know and enquirer about cure for HERPES and i read someone testimony on how he was cured from HSV-2 so i decided to contact  the same herbalist Call DR Ovie because i know that nature has the power to heal everything. i contacted him to know how he can help me and he told me never to worry that he will help me with the natural herbs from God! after 2 days of contacting him, he told me that the cure has been ready and he sent it to me via UPS SPEED POST and it got to me after 3 days! i used the medicine as he instructed me (MORNING and EVENING) and i was cured! its really like a dream but i am so happy   contact dr Ovie ,via email: ovie.miraclemedicine1@gmail.com or contact Dr via his whats-app: +2349056393169 his also specialize in treating all kinds of illness, HERPES VIRUS, HEPATITIS B, CANCER, BRAIN DISEASE, INFERTILITY, DIABETES AND MORE
Love Ali pakistan❤❤❤💞
I KNEw aiT
So such huge guys take orders from a high flyer, that is not acceptable.
Wwe have retribution,Aew have the dark order °_°
Okay I am in.
zzz
And this guy is a former cop.
So WWE is paying off Mustafa Ali as hacker storyline, it's good. Not gonna lie
Michael Cole @ 1:43: There's Slapjack on the outside! Simply Badass.
Mustafa Ali❤️👍👍
How stupid! The leader is a gay jobber and so are the rest of them members! Lmao! 🤦‍♂️
*01:20** Get Him* 👍
Great to see .... something good happening with Mustafa Ali.... He's a huge talent... Great push
I knew it because we saw mustafa ali sign in the computers of retribution
RETRIBURION THE NEW  "SIELD"
Great Great   All hail Vince❤
Finally!!! Ali get pushed now 💥💥💥
Really Awesom storyline is building finally a heel for ali,🔥🔥
Let's go mustafa
I like it however WWE has taught me not to trust in anything they do.
Ali 😎
When ali was in smackdown, the retribution  attack was based on smackdown.. And then ali came in raw,,the base of retribution attack start on raw... That,s the link of this storyline
And again there's no cm punk
You know what, alright.
The Hell
Does that mean he is now heel
I loved this storyline,both Raw and Retribution became more interesting bt it could've been lit with actual audiences
This will be fun
Omg!!!!!
Please don't screw this WWE!!🙏🙏🙏🙏
Begins with the HACKER thing and ends up to this, Good job WWE👌
Finally he got a push!!!
Just the same as the Aces & Eights stint on TNA!!
Was not expecting it to be Mustafa
Pubg bro
2019 nearly world titel picture 2020 leader of the biggest joke of the wrestling industry
0:47 Nice cut lmao
Good things
all WWE universe in LED is a paid actor.. they should never give a thumbs down to Hurt Business. Now you see why...
😱😱😱
Ali dont have the mike skill
buuuuuuu for mustafa ali
*This is the push my boy ali deserves*
Why isn't Credic Alexander coming with the hurt business?
Retribution has been the worst storyline of the year so far. It's so dumb I can't even describe it. Discount Nexus.
Wtf this is the biggest plot twist of the year! Well done.
This has to be the worst and weakest looking faction I've ever seen
Mustafa ali being retributions leader doesnt make sense💀 like at all💀
He fight very well evry match definitely a talented and Entertaining wrestler. It aslo makes a lot of sense to make Ali Leader
It still is a bit uneven to me that such a natural babyface like Ali would be portrayed as a heel...
Retribution is kinda bullet club ripoff lol.
"Get him!!"
Seriously that’s cool but ANOTHER HEEL !! Considering that Kevin Owens will be heel again thanks to the Fiend seriously there are too much of them
Mustafa has the look and everything! He will elevate the Retribution faction.
Retribution Leader Expaction : Roman Reigns 😈🔥🔥 Reality : Mustafa Ali 😭😭
People saying that Ali lacked charisma seriously have a bad memory. Forgot the inspirational promos he cut around early 2019 before Orton kicked him in the eye.
Ali was the hacker and when he saw all the hacked dirt he got crazy and psychotic and then created retribution.
I like it, considering the fact he used to be a cop, it makes sense. Former authority figure corrupting his team members. Yall need to give this a chance.
Where is Cedric Alexander???
lol WWE is winging this angle big time
lol! i still cant take these guys serious after appearing with those halloween masks. they just look so funny in their masks when they are suppose to be and look like a dominant group...
Wait, so he’s Mustafa again?
Ali! YOU! TRAITOR!
Wwe push Ali like roman Seth
الله
I think wwe not push up to ali. For this he join the retribution
Just like BRODIE LEE leading DARK ORDER... 😁😁😁😁😁
Dark Order sign. AEW ripoff already? Hmmm? 🤔
Glad to see the hacker storyline ended up here. Out with the light, in with the dark.
best moment raw 💖💖
Mustafa Ali turns heel and that's so shocking.
Cameraman seems drunk, or maybe I am 😅
Would’ve been better if cm punk was leader. But I like the angle
Dumbest stryline ina while Just bring back Brodie and Adrk order  At least the leader is not a midget
Jinder Mahal lol🤣🤣
This is really surprised.thats why wwe is always unpredictable.Ali is great of greatest.
1:19 get em 🔥🔥
Can somebody tell me where the hell cendric is?
MVP & Shelton had the best reactions to Mustafa Ali 😂😂😂
Not gonna lie I love the retribution gear
One good moment from an entire 3 hour show.
Why at the expense of The Hurt Business 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
HOY 👍👍
Let’s be real Ali made this group a bit better but it’s still a bit trash
BAK SEN ALİYE BAK BAK :9
I love how everyone was right about the hacking but I didn't expect this 😂
I hope cm punk is revealed as a second leader. Like a old wiser member whos been around the block in wwe,  he one of the other masked members. And they should do a female connection and another leader. To a female group for the group.
TURKEY TURKEY TURKEY👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
i love this booking with Ali  wwe has done something good i'm loveing it
Pityfull leader for a great faction
Retribution = The Dark Order
So Ali Is Heel Or Is Retribution Face?
I thought this was a good swerve. I ain’t see it coming. Ali as the leader of Retribution. This could be good for his career. In a way it could tie into the Smackdown Hacker Angle. Even though they never said Ali was the hacker or not but to most people the signs were there. Now we’ll just have to see where this goes and leads
Very happy 😍💋 💝💖♥️❤️
Ali was the mysterious hacker until it magically turn retribution leader that makes so much sense... Hacker was pulled down from Smackdown but entering monday night raw is different side of the coin
HES THE HACKER AND LEADER DAMN ALI.
My reaction with all things Retribution: pfft!
Any one gets nexus vibes  Nah just me😞
Bruv what’s next John cena goes heel
WWE, just stop destroying new talents and their careers
There's the Predator, Jason, Bane right there
I didn't see this coming   Like if you also didn't see this coming
I like how the hurt business is like a little face
So is he a heel now?
Boo mustafa ali
this is terrible lol
huge let down. Ali is an aweful promo. all spots. sloppy wrestler. and my child could throw him across the room. eh bad choice in my opinion. just feels like they have to do it because he was injured for his prior run kofi took.
Very good
Common what kinda leader is this .... XD
When the best faction in WWE rn meets the worst
The only time I don't watch raw  something happens
So no one's gonna talk about Ali's wicked grin at the end
Every other wrestling company: There should be an equal number of babyfaces and heels for the purpose of storylines  WWE: Make everyone heel because giving wrestlers a little bit of an edge results in them automatically getting over so that we don't have to write any storylines
The truth has finally been herd
The face of mvp
Guys skip to 2:35, the tattoo on the guy; That is Shane Thorne from NXT. Other members revealed Dominik Dijakovic Mia Yim
Bruh ur telling me the tough buff guys from retribution are taking orders from Mustafa Ali???
se paso ALI era el causante de todo
They saved raw but smackdown is still better
I Think Cedric Alexander is a mole in the Hurt Business sent by retribution
Ali doesn't have the face to be a heel, dude looks like he just got out of middle school 😂
I said I knew it I said. Isnt crazy how Ali makes his return then all of sudden retribution comes. And Ik for fact Ali was the Hacker watch it's gone all come out
Mvp is besr
Yesss I hope this means a great push for him
I love you Ali
Not mustafa Ali I did not think he was the leader of retribution
Wow I thought it was someone else who was the leader of retribution
I think ricochet joins hurt business
Guys I have put my reaction on Mustafa Ali being the leader of the retribution of my YouTube channel please check it out it’s crazy
THIS WAS AWESOME MAN STILL CANT BELIEVE IT
This Monday, raw. Yes, it surprised me
Bane and predator
I’m so happy for Ali this so cool
Finally something to do for Ali! He deserves it! Now imagine if Ricochet also joins a faction Crews will be on his own again.
I think that un storyline he is upset for mitb and he made all this plan
It’s predator and bane in the thumbnail
Very nice subscribers hehehe
Can we just talk about MVP for a second he’s back like he never left
Quien te conoce exaltado .........? Ali es líder de retribución.
The big dude with the long dreadlocks looks like he mimics the “ Predator “ in movement and his mask as well ..
Ali like arab that aliance to israel...
Yeah james is right
Slapjack goes wire to wire in the Royal Rumble, Challenges Roman Reings next night on Raw for Wrestlemania.  Retribution attacks Roman on Smackdown & Otis cashes in.  Double Main Event for Wrestlemania 37, Slapjack V Otis for the Universal Championship, T-Bar V Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship.  Retribution holds the gold at the end of the night.
funny how “fAns” think Ali doesn’t deserve this spotlight just because he doesn’t have the “size, mic skills and charisma.” to think this could also be the same “fAns” who hate Vince for pushing “biG sWEaty mEn whO dOn’t kNow hOw tO wREstle.” everybody wants to be a booker. everybody wants to be a writer. we clearly don’t deserve even the simplest things in life. no wonder why we’re in a pandemic.
Wwe been gay on someone's momma
Mvp looked like a disappointed dad
This RETRIBUTION stuff is actually starting to come together... Mustafa Ali was the Smackdown Hacker. We thought that storyline was dropped, when he suddenly appeared on RAW and the Smackdown Hacker stopped showing up entirely on Smackdown. But, in reality, the storyline just changed places. Clever plays by whoever manages these storylines. Who knows. Maybe this will actually become a decent faction in the end.
This was an Epic Plot twist!!!
And we thought cm punk was the leader
Boring leader in the world
"Alright, I have to admit, this time I've been caught off guard" -JonTron 2014
They are all actors
Me, when i hoped for half a year the leader will be cm punk: 🗿🗿🗿
Watch the nexus come back and defeat the retribution 😭
Geez you can just tell how staged everything is, back in the earlier years of wwe it was more subtle and some what believable...now it's just a circus act.  Miss the old days off wwe😭
Dio looks like predator while Dijakovik looks like bane
Me: Bruh I’m Sick and Tired of Retribution They’re a Joke   *Ali Is the Leader of Retribution    Me: Take My Money Now!
I think i'm the only one who's disapointed with this choice, dijak deserved the leadership
Glad wwe kept up with continuity. Letting the Hacker storyline lay low, only to bring it back  Really adds up to the retribution story
I can't take it seriously 😅 slapjack ffs 🤣🤣🤣🤣
first is this team a attempt to bring back the attitude era or what
all planed sistem show used fore money making and %75  true wreastling %25 fake wreastling
STOP WITH THE SHAKING CAMERA WWE!!!!!! Geeeezuss
I like how everyone hated Retribution until Ali came out as the leader. I hope they at least change the names of the people in the group to something more dominant.
This twist got my thumbs down. It made no sense. Mustafa is RETRIBUTION now. Come on. What a joke.
Hahahahhaha I wish there was a laughing 😂 button at YouTube 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ali nailed that get em' line
Wwe better than football
Oh god no! 😨 Mustafa Ali is........... THE NEW LEADER OF RETRIBUTION?!?!?!? 😱😱😱
Hi Guys 😍💋 💝💖
Ali is exceptionally talented  and deserves to be involved in something big
Yawn
"The Misadventures of Slapjack."
You guys are done with out Ashley
This is your chance Wwe, do something right and give Ali a major push.
Sorry but this is disappointing and boring, wwe have ruined something brilliant
What a twist 🙌🏾🙌🏾
Worst wwe faction, ever.
Just like Stephanie McMahon, Mick Foley, Shane McMahon and Daniel Bryan are Team RAW and Team SmackDown because there my favorite back in 2016
Hurt Business Went From Smiling To We Done Farkd Up🤣🤣🤣🤣
Also payback is coming coming real soon
Retribution is just a cheap copy of DARK ORDER from AEW. Face the facts!
Great decision fantastic talent
Nobody is gonna talk how he nailed that "Get him" line right
I like the hurt business better than the retribution, the authority and also the Nexus Including The Evolution
Man, I should of kept watching RAW.
Get Jordan Omobeihin as a member of RETRIBUTION.
That Smile From Ali THO. 2:43
Cool, the Bane Gang has a leader now, only "thing" they have going for them are the masks and again we see there is zero creativity in pro wrestling, Bullet Club rip off, as did the Bullet club with NWO/DX. Can we please see something that has not been done before?
Mufasa Ali is the leader?
Can I just say this is basically a rip off of every other team that has excited. NWO speciifally. Heck that ending with him raising his hand. That's basically the Dark Order.
Ali for the new US champion
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Much better, now drop the masks and change the names :)
This gonna be like a racist joke?
Yeah eat that AEW Dark Order
The guy with the dreads did waaaaaay too much🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Ha! T-Bag.
Now it's interesting... Mustafa Ali made the Dark Order sign? "Can I copy you homework?" "Yes, but change a little bit..." 😂😂😂
That's official. Raw has become Gotham
Finally.
Lol I just noticed the look on Shelton Benjamin’s face as the Ali revelation was starting, 😂😂😂😂👍👍👍🤘🤘🤘 Go Retribution !!!!
I thought the leader was gunna end up being Vince McMahon....He'd be all like "IT WAS ME ALL ALONG, AUSTIN!"
is that shane thorne in the group?
Don't Lie This Was A Surprise
This should've ended the show.
So we assume Ali is the leader instead of just a member
So most of wwe is heel.guess brock gonna come back as face & win
Nooooooo Ali 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Dislike 👎
i still cant get that get em outa my head i thought his voice was higher
The end was like CM Punk and The Nexus
What about Mustafa's two friends?????
This just doesn't make sense, where's the motive?
I hope the hurt business adds another guy and it can be a survivor series match, The Hurt Business vs Retribution.
1:14 The look on The Hurt Business priceless. Ali to RETRIBUTION get them.
Mustafa Ali is the leader... That sounds cool, but would have been better if they at least built up Ali. He lost clean on his second week back. He is gone for a few more weeks, comes back and now is the leader of a heel stable. If this was the plan they should have made Mustafa Ali a big deal since his return. Made him rack up singles wins and look like a title contender. Instead he has a clean loss, weeks of no action, missed every pay per view since his return and now we are supposed to find him threatening since he is the leader of heels who cheer for smashing a window with a brick? I think I would have been more excited if Ali and Retribution were built up a little bit better.
Ali, I didn't trust you
Che cazzo ceio vedo wrestling meglio questa invece guarda le cose pin che non capisco un cazzo valigetta
Retribution=modern day nexus
This was dope even tho they should of done it at the end of the show.
That was so awesome
Chalés yo pensé que eran los de la triple A
Why did Mustafa do this I guess the YouTube was right Mustafa Ali does lead retribution 🤬
Whaaaaat no way there was no possible way I could have ever known that this is surprising to me😐
So basically a guy called MUSTAFA ALI is leading a group of extremists with masks who are reeking havoc and terrorising everyone... just let that sink in and think about it...
Any one else is made that you made retribution on wwe 2k but now you have to change it all over again
2020: Roman turns heel, mustafa is the leader of a heel group , Rey mysterios son started wrestling. What’s going on 🤣
This is the resume of an only word: Perseverence. None storyline was trashed, it was all unite in one. Perfect!
noice
Ex cop vs ex criminal
So technically in this situation RETRIBUTION is heel and Hurt Business is Face and Ali just turned heel
Ali wipe the smile off the hurt business face what a joke😂😂😂
1:03 Retribution: I dont know you boy Mustafa Ali: here is my username and ID Retribution: YES BOSS *Boss Account Verified* MVP: Why do i hear boss music???
T-Bar should be Havoc and mace should be Ravage. Are those good names? No not really but I like them
Where was cedric Alexander?? Also this was a great plot twist. The whole retribution thing seemed really random but now it is starting to make sense! I can't wait to see how this rivalry will unfold.
I think the hurt business is a tweener group, more bad then good but they are simply business. They will defend their company when necessary but will destroy people in their own company when necessary. Retribution is shown as the main complete heel faction wanting to destroy everyone in wwe so its kind of like a tweener group vs a heel group. Similar to randy orton (tweener) vs aj styles. When the story wants randy to be good he is good but when the story wants randy to be bad he is going to be bad. Still i want a triple threat for wrestlemania for group dominance, retributions mustafa ali vs hurt business cedric alexander vs team babyface apollo cruz. Sounds like fun i dunno maybe not the best idea.
The dreadlocked member reminds me of Dean Ambrose... Could it be?
Alexander turn heel, Reigns turn heel, Cole and Priest now could be Face and now this... So now turning is the only way the make better your status? Well Ali was said and confirmed to be the hacker, maybe this will help him to become WWE United States Champion and could get closer to main event zone..
Although I am not liking RETRIBUTION that much still, Heel Mustafa Ali could be great if booked right
LAME Vinny, LAME!!
Cool, but he would be good as the hacker too.
Meh
I think it's the most shooking moment in 2020
this has made me like retribution a bit more tbh, i was worried that they where gonna get ruined but mustafa could really turn this around
Wao ali good job very nice wwe alwas playing u dear keep it up
Super mustafa
Well this finally got interesting
Knew mustafa Ali was hacker
You know what im not even upset that ali's the leader his been played ever since he got in wwe.
I'm so happy for Mustafa Ali he so deserves the push! Some things are just worth the wait. From missed WWE title opportunity to Retribution leader. His stars have aligned! Up with power Ali!
now Ali is the leader I'm pretty sure Vince gonna turn him in to an "American enemy", he gonna bring an "American hero" to destroy retribution and that will be the end of their careers.
So who’s HeeL and Who’s babyface??
Anyone Else Find It Interesting How Ali's Voice Slightly Got Deeper When He Said "Get Em"... Dude Sounded Crazy As Hell
1:39  I THINK THAT'S TARVER FROM THE NEXUS CAUSE WHEN HE GOT PEOPLE ON THE GROUND HE WOULD STARE THEM DOWN LIKE THAT!!!!!
This is great
i think cm punk and connor are in retribution
What was better Roman turning heel or Ali turning heel?
Why are they trying to copy the dark order from AEW
Procedo a XD
I like The Retribution vs The Fiend Bray Wyatt.😮
Ali 🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏
Survivor series  Retribution  Smackdown  Raw 205 live
All I need now is an “Ali Bomaye” chant and my life is complete
That guy trying to be like the fiend
Mustafa ali es un crack 😮😊
Did Ali single-handedly turned The Hurt business face?
Kid:Mom, can we have dark order? Mom:We have dark order in home Dark order in home:
I can’t be the only one that thought they were gonna unmask there was I
bane wannabe
The commentators are horrible.
1:13 that jaw dropped real quick
Good old slap nuts and t bag...
Then ricochet and apollo join hurt business to even up the odds
Mustafa Ali did not forget He was going to get a Push before his Injury in Early 2019.
meh.
good ali not hurt the hurt bissnet
I was trying to take retribution seriouse untill i heard Cole say Slapjack 🙈🤣🤣
omg
This is cool and all...but I think it would have been even cooler if it turned out to be Sting...
Very good booking, wwe has improved a great deal lately keep it up
1:17 me and my big brothers on our way to jump the kid that jumped me
Get em 😈😈😈🔥
Super Mustafa ali
I have this feeling that retribution is wwe's version of the dark order
Finally now i have a reason to watch raw.
the nexus 2020
They look like villains from teenage mutant ninja turtles. Those names have to go. They just don't sound good when said all together. Here's ali with slapjack and tbar.
Pray malaysia bcs covid19 really bad
Thanks to me I knew it all along
ooh Ali looked great with that cocky smile when he turned to mvp. I can see a great heel on him
What a way to waste t bars ether on twitter smfh
This is probably why he wasn’t shown on TV as much. He was always an attacker with Retribution.
Mustafa Ali is a b whole and he says that wwe didn’t give him a chance when they did
Ohh yeahh THE FIRE RISES!!! Mustafa 2020.
This good now change those horrible names you do that everyone  would get on board
Thinking about it, maybe Ali wants RETRIBUTION for his wwe chance as he was supose to win the WWE championship last year but he got injured
Anytime Ali/Retribution appear on my screen, it’s time for a bathroom break/change the channel.
M.v.p got fat lmbo
I love this Ali
Ali baba and the 40 thieve 😂😂 lol
Wow I see a lot of wwe shills here in the comment section...Maybe this will be good. I know a lot of people just like this now because it is new. Just like Roman vs Jey now.
I'm glad this was something we weren't expecting expect earlier the night where he was wearing a black top
YES! YES! YES!
If Muhammad Hassan had Retribution he'd be a world champion
Got Hurt Business
1:14 Hurt Business - What is it supposed to be!!!!
This is shocking!
Wwes version of dark order?
I see bane, the predator, and jason working together.
This saved this storyline, it was going downhill, good job wwe for finally using retrobution and mustafa right.
Samoa joe is good as a commentator but he was wasted😞
Wait there were more members of retribution
1:22 He switches sides and immediately his voice magically gets deeper and sinister 😅😂
Every time they fight the hurt business Bobby be getting out there. It always takes the main 2 guys from retribution to finally stop him
I prefer T-Bar with his Stupid name as the Leader than Mustafa Ali 🤦🏻‍♂️
MUSTAFA ALUISOUS ALI IS THE LEADER?
Could’ve sworn he was gonna throw up that ‘TOO SWEET!’
I throuth Roman reigns was the retribution leader
Hurt business is turning babydace?  Nah!
The Hurt Business and The team of Ricochet And Apollo Crews are Teaming Up someday against Mustafa Ali And Retribution
Noooooo why wwe
Wait, what if, Retribution will interrupt the hell in a cell match between drew and orton so that Ali can get vengence for injuring him before the elimination chamber where kofi take his place and go on to wrestlemania to win the championship????
If you can't beat them  join him after you join them screw them
That little guy doesn't fit as the leader lol
i do not like mustafa ali playing a bad guy it like bad on hes country all not like hes countrys polepole & do not tihnk at tha or bad ine way wood wwe want tihnk this is a good thing to do ? can ine one tall me
Best long term booked storyline that WWE has done in years plus retribution members on Twitter and social media are fantastically holding up the fort
This is a double turn!!
Stop Shaking and Zooming in randoming, Jesus Christ Kevin Dunn
so they expect us to cheer for the hurt business? really? Retribution are giving them their just desserts
AEW RULES
Well it wasn’t cm punk 😭
What if the leader is “The Finisher” from Slam City?!
I like it. He's getting what he deserves. I think the hacker storyline wasn't going anywhere and it's great that they dropped it. He can do so much with this group.
I didn't know that Predator went to WWE to become a wrestler
Finally Ali turns heel. He has quality to be a heel like seth or  cm punk. WWE should fullest use his talent.
So if orton win at HIAC,can he get the feud with ali ? Because orton makes ali lost his opportunity to get wwe Champions last year right ? ali can use the retribution to take revenge to orton 🤔
What a rip off of AEW Dark Order lmao wow wwe wow
Свет угас
It makes alot of sense Ali's face persona was kinda of superheroish now he is a villian. I swear Ali was rumoured to become a heel early this year.
Lol Low Budget Fiend 😅 in Retribution
I will admit I thought wwe was gonna screw up retribution. But Mustafa Ali as the leader???? Didn’t see that coming at all, pretty dope.
All hail Prince Ali
Not only do they have identical looks, Seth and Ali are both leaders of their own heel groups on Raw.
Is it just me or does Mustafa Ali look like Jesus here?
Ummmm so musta fa Ali is bad now or good like what
Yes ✌️
Heel Ali Will Be Fun To Watch🍿👀
Golden moments that happened, that will go unnoticed: - Slapjack did gesture to Ali to join The Hurt Business in the middle of the ring. - Then points out to Mace and T-Bar, triggering Mace's gesture. - Mace gestured to Ali to come join them. - Ali orders RETRIBTUION to go get The Hurt Business.  Is Ali really leading RETRIBUTION ? Or is RETRIBUTION leading Ali here ? Or maybe, just maybe, is it a deal between both sides because they both feel the same way about the company ?
mustafa no why mate my faveurite  wwe wrestiler
01:10 hahahahah
Whattttt😯😯😯😯😯😯😯🤬😱😱😱😱😱😱 mustafaaaaaaa ali leader of retribución imposible
Me knowing i got to go to 💤
retribution is a continue of hacker
That was awesome salute mustafa Ali
i can't say i enjoy yet another pure babyface turning into a bad guy, but if this leads to mustafa being taken seriously then i'll take what i can get
honestly i don't mind this..this is good actually..we know Ali deserves more so this might be his chance:)  also i liked how his voice changed when he said ''get him''
Something fresh i liked 👍
Where’s Cedrick ????
0:43 you can see Ali smile when the lights flicker if you pay close attention.
What a great moment for Ali, congrats, this is awsome !!
So what will be his new name? Tape Glove???
Finally WWE getting back on the right track with these storylines now to really be the hurt business and add brawn strowman to the mixed Bobby Lasley= WWE Champion  Brawn Strowman=US Champion  MVP & Shelton Benjamin Tag Team Champions with the Fiend and his new family move to Raw The Fiend Alex Bliss Aleister Black Kevin Owens and Randy Orton plus Retribution to battle in a new storyline for control of WWE
Dio as Predator 3
Man not to be negative but why did it have to be ali
I can see a Raw civil war coming soon
Retribution has Jason, Bane and the predator.
Shelton: 😃>🤨 MVP: 😃>😳 Lashley: 😐>😐
I new it  cause he returned as soon as retribution started
Lol a copy from dark order in AEW
Maybe that was 'The Truth Will Be Told" the hacker Ali was Talking About back on Smackdown
where's Ced?
Everything about the retribution looks like AEW's dark order.. Even the final taunt when they raise their palm towards the cam
The part that I’m confused in is that the Retribution is heel and the Hurt Business is heel so what are they doing?
So are the Hurt Business faces or heels? Because they seem to switch every week...
But like where’s Cedric are we suppose to forever about him?
Isn't anyone going talk about how Ali's voice went deep when he said "get em"
So hes a heel now
So who are the rest of the members
I DID NOT EXPECT THIS,I LOVED ALI BUT WHAT HE DID WAS UNFORGET AND FORGIVE ABLE LIKE RLLY
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha what a joke
This is sick
I knew it all along something wasn't right here
Are Retribution Faces???? Or are Hurt Business
I didn't see that coming. Sometimes it's always the silent ones who becomes the antagonist.
Mustafa Ali
1:17 amazing!!
Predator 🤣
Amazing story line😍
seth rollin wannabe
Wow nice good job wwe
If the superstars got ahold of the retribution’s soldiers, they should of unmasked them to exposed of what they are
I think I'm starting to understand the whole concept of this operation🤣
Watch Ali turn on ricochet and Apollo next week or few weeks later
So which group turned face
I'm quite surprised for not seeing more memes about hurt business facial expressions lol
Either Apollo or Ricochet joins Retribution the other joins the Hurt Business, and there’s your 5 on 5 survivor series match
why is it that almost every face wrestler went to heel?
That was unexpected and really well executed, Having Ali as the leader, now has me invested.
Why not just call them Dijak, Thorne, and Dio? It keeps them short but keeps their characters as well
I'm pretty sure that one of them is Shane Thorne because I think I saw his tattoos at the end
The twist! This is the return of the hacker. Amazing storyline.   Edit: Wonder what his teammates last week think of
this was good. and mvp going from smile to worry on his face mace this all the better too!
i love it... finally Ali getting a push... awesome... great heel turn...good script so far.
Hurt business needs more members  !
It is NOT CM Punk.
Just get rid of the retribution and pretend it never happened. The Raw storylines have been great already
someone can explain me please about mustafa ali and the hacker thing ??? I don´t understand
They need to fix the names still
Soooo all this storyline just to see that the leader of the group is a jobber? Are we supposed to care now?
The camera work here is ridiculous. Zooming in and out constantly, fast cuts between 15 different cameras. Not fun to watch, doesn’t add “excitement” to what’s going on, just makes it annoying to watch.
😮😮😮😮😮Ali joining Retribution?! Oh no
Mustafa Ali vs CM Punk!
Meh
Predator and Bane in wwe
Holly damn.. Mustafa Ali was behind this army. I can't believe that. New drama comes out babe.
Never understood why wwe always tries to insult our intelligence cause everyone knows who they are but no Vince McMahon thinks slapping some stupid mask on them and giving them names like flapjack and tiki bar is going to make us not realize who they really are 🤦‍♂️. Let them be who they are and come in with the major attitude that they have
Maddin looks god awful in those pants
Just when every body stop thing he wasn’t it is revealed LOL good Move wwe
with the way retribution is going ... so far they have subzero, scorpion, reptile ... most of the mortal kombat characters will be in soon!
Wait does this mean they going to change Ali theme song now 😐.
2:44 - join the dark order🤪
I like the heel ali smile. Has some charisma, somehow
I LOVE RETRIBUTION NOW!!
Love it.
Gente manda esse grupo embora respeito WWE algulm tá no meu lado você descobri  que é o líder
Mustafa has finally seen the darkness instead of the light
Undertaker sucks
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤬😭🤬😭🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😭🤬😭🤬😭🤬😭🤬😭😭😭🤬😭🤬🤬😭😭😭🤬😭😭😭🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤬😭🤬😭
Ali's involvement makes this at least somewhat interesting now.
He was one of my choices as the leader
Stables RAW Hurt Business (MVP, Bobby Lashlhey, Shelton Benjamin & Cedric Alexander) RAW RETRIBUTION (Mustafa Ali, Dominik Dijakovic,Dio Maddin, Shane Thorne, Mia Yim & Mercedes Matinez) NXT The Undisputed Era (Adam Cole, Kyle O'Reilly, Bobby Fish & Roderick Strong)  NXT El legado del fantasma (Santos Escorbar, Joaquin Wilde & Raul Mendoza)
Who knew the smackdown hacker would be the leader since retribution appeared
1:19 "get 'em." goosebumps men, goosebumps.
The hurt Business could have bested them if they were just staying in the ring. That way they could have seen each one of them coming.
WWE RAW
All this time we thought The Miz was the leader but it was Ali all along!
Okay, im interested in Retribution again
The Leader of Retribution is Mustafaaaa Aaaaalllliiiiiiiii!
i was in the thunderdome
The Yautjas called. They left a cousin behind on earth 🤣
Cm punk was not the imposter
the screens turned off . i felt that .
The way hurt business is shock by mustafa ali leader is my favorite
Didn’t expect this
dude went full on Megaton when he said “ Get em “
He should of turned on apollo and ricochet .. smh
damn you mustafa!!
Retribution are cool but, why do they all have names that sound better placed in the OG ‘80s Transformers cartoon?
so we have are survivor series team hurt buisness vs retribution newest members question is who will join the hurt buisness
The guy I never thought would turn heel  but the way he said Get em tho that me chills
So is Miz going to be a co-leader eventually? Those times where he arrived late and they brought attention to it seemed to lead he would be involved or did they drop it like they always do?
Ali , madmax and predator😂
So was retribution the hackers on smackdown
Does this mean apollo and ricochet will turn on ali
Heel Ali vs Heel Rollins      book it now
So he has a first name now
Huh basically the people who Vince never pushed guess we knew it was coming
Is it just me but when Mastafa Ali clenched his fist it reminded me of Dying Light you know Rais' Men the logo is a clenched fist.
Change the names 🤦🏻‍♂️
yeah this was sorta cool but I still find retribution extremely lame
Funny how all of the members are taller then him
2:37 "Destruction" kinda cringe lol
Cedric is in the Hurt Business? Ali is in RETRIBUTION? Murphy is a Disciple?  205 Live: Good to know my boys are doing well in life. 😢
Mustafa ali turn heel and murphy turn face I must say raw is getting pretty awesome
Fantastic, WWE is getting better now that they're focusing on younger and newer stars.
He should have said finish em.
SWERVE! I dig it tho 👌
The Hurt Business will get there revenge lol
Where's Alexander?
LMAOOO people thought roman was the leader
Mustafa Ali?! No wonder WWE has lost many viewers. Looks like the disappointments in WWE will never end!
Man The Expression On MVP's Face Changed Like "Wait A Minute, You Mean You.."
Ali has ascended and become the new Messiah
Wtf
so more or less you want ali's career over by doing the same storyline as muhammad hassan vs taker where they had a group of thugs beat everyone up. isn't this a little Racist?
That good
This is why ppl are embarrassed to admit they watch wrestling.
Jeez, The Hurt Business is one of the lamest name WWE ever come up with
No what if one the retribution members was the hacker cause think about it the hacker thing stopped when retribution joined wwe
Where is cedric Alexander
Now all I can think is What if Ali was never injured last year  Would kofi be the leader?
So the leader of retribution is Aladdin?
Just when everyone taught they gave up on Ali. It turns out it was major push instead.
Retribution is going from being a group of clowns looking for work to a more serious and intimidating group
I like it
😍❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🏻
Ali be like “sic em boys”
wtf mustafa ali ???
2:35 hmmm.... that tattoo seems fimiliar...
AEW: Brodie Lee, Dark Order WWE: Mustafa Ali, Retribution
When did Ali get his full name back?
He looks like a punk that would be in antifa so makes sense.
I knew something was off about Ali!!
Dio Maddin is scary as hell in that getup.
Mustafa Ali as the leader🤣🤣🤣who thought about this
i was actually surprised and not expected Ali to be the leader.
Finally a long awaited reveal in WWE that doesn't include Hornswoggle. 👍
Why they got Mace looking like The Predator? I know it's almost Halloween but really? 😂
When Ali was smiling at the end he looked like an evil mastermind...lol
Next week, ali should introduce them with their real names and throw the masks away and connect the hacker storyline with this.
Does anybody even care about this
Does anyone else feel like bruce wayne gave bane orders to attack john jones
LITERALLY DOING THE DARK ORDER HAND SIGNAL
Slapjack looks like Cole Quinn with a mask
Mustafa is kinda innocent but he is rally the leader
When Ali turned around my p*ssy dropped
Mustafa ali is heel now or no😕😕😕😕
This angle might even be stupider than the bliss fiend angle wtf is this garbage
What a twist! Lol
So so SO many better options
Yes it's not punk
Sheltons face at 1:16 is fantastic
OH MY MUSTAFA ALI WAS THE LEADER OF RETRIBUTION
I do like the direction they are going with Retribution.  Relying on the Hurt Business is not a good idea for Raw.  No. RETRIBUTION isn't another shot at making the Nexus play out.  This is a group of proven talented people raging at how people who screwed over the Company are just "let back in" and given spots that they should have. The most justified motive for a faction to date.
1:10-1:14 no lie I'm really digging Dio's look and mannerisms.
HURT BUSINESS: You can't beat us. MUSTAFA ALI: I know, but they can
Finally
Weird sheild
Now retribution has my attention see it wasn’t that important the last few weeks because they were all masked and nobodies Ali is a guy who’s push was retained caused of Kofi
Hahaha the leader is the tiny guy. 😂😂😂😂
MVP smile disappearing  Ali's GET'EM
Geeks ...
NICE ONE.  Damn sure didn't see this one coming. Now let's see how far it goes before CREATIVE messes this one up.
Hurt business needs some help with these clowns
So we basically have the WWE equivalent of Antifa attacking BLM . . . when in real life BLM is pretty fed up with Antifa for highjacking their cause . . . will be really interesting to see how this goes
I didn't know Bain and Predator started wrestling
THIS IS AMAZING THIS ALL LINKS ALL THE WAY FROM THE HACKER STORYLINE
awesome
Michael Hayes:well why don't we just call him slapjack
Triple HHH: We Are NXT!!! Mustafa Ali:WE ARE RETRIBUTION
1:14 their reaction was so good 😂
A lot of people thought Roman Reigns was the leader.
Türk’ler gösterin kendinizi
عنجد جنان 😇😇😇
Mvp reaction was great!!!
Ho I know guy with a BIG forehead not going  to be happy
Who else never saw this coming
Good thing to push a talented ali. We'd like to see him at the top.
A genuine shock to me and from what i see many many others. I really thought it was The Miz but props to WWE for utilizing one of their young talent into a prominent storyline.
This can either go good for Ali or bad for Retribution
Who else thought it would be Roman reigns of someone Mustafa is in the retribution that is crazy tho
Mustafa Ali just made Retribution over
i love this
The highlight of the show was this and braun and keith
I saw bane and predator in raw
Why didn't they attack the camera man?
U know they can revive the hacker story line with retribution i would pay for some of that show
After watching this revelation and repeating it on YouTube, now I wonder between them who's the heel team again?
very stupid idea.
BLM ✊🏿
I didn't see this one coming😐😬
Is this like the new Nexus?
Completely shocked by this way to go for the continuation. This is obviously a Dark Order group taking those who were promised opportunities, did their parts and got nothing.   Might as well reveal the five (D-Madden, Mercedes Martinez, Mia Yim, Shane Thorne and Dominick Dijakovic) and build off of the exposure. Mustafa felt rejected after Kofi Kingston snatched everything that coulda' be his. Taking 'Retribution' and I see his first feud with him.
Now im no longer a fan of mustafa ali
this white mask guy reminds me the beginning of one Batman movie where it was robbery with clown masks
this white mask guy reminds me the beginning of one Batman movie where it was robbery with clown masks
The theme is stronger fusion
I can't believe it
I like how MVP smile got wiped out
It all makes sense now. Ali was supposed to be the hacker but he wanted RETRIBUTION because Kofi got the push he was supposed to get and instead of attacking Kingston he's going after the whole damn system. Brilliant
Nobody is gonna talk how he nailed that "Get him" line
Gang Warfare
I think this is the time when it should be revealed that Ali is the Smackdown Hacker
Whole group will disappear within 12 weeks
Dang where was Apollo and Ricochet.
Hurt Business-Retribution has just been listed as the factions that go to war.
2020 Finally had something good
WTF
Finally! ali got the spotlight now
we´ll see how long retribution lasts
The predator and bane are working together 😂😂😂
Still trash.
What’s Smoke from Mortal Combat doing in Retribution?
Rhis is the most unexpected moment in wwe
Why is so many people heel
I DON’T CARE!!!!    I WANT TO KNOW WHO PIED OWENS !!!??
So Mustafa Ali.....okay I didnt see that one coming, I will accept this, just 2 things...............1 WHY YOU COULDN'T REVEAL THIS IN A FREAKING PPV? WWE plz safe stuff like these for BIG time events not for free TV programs, damn.....and 2.......PUSH ALI TO THE MOON, if you are giving the guy this faction, make this important, so push Ali, make him CHAMP soon.
This was unexpected right here. ali is the leader and the hacker of retribution the whole time!!!!!
Booo i hate ali now
its has to be the muslim  blm: RACIST, DISCRIMINATION, APRESSION
Dang, I thought Evil Uno was the leader of the group this whole time, but I guess WWE wanted Ali to lead the Dark Order
Woh that’s shocking
Who else felt that get em
They’ll never be able to recreate the nexus
The best twist of 2020 thank you wwe give Ali the push he deserves
Is it true that Mustafa Ali the Leader of Retribution Team???!!Why him??!!
Mustafa Ali was The Imposter
YES this is so great for Ali
The dark order is better
Where are the other members of RETRIBUTION??  They were tested of *COVID-19!*
😱😱😱😱😱
Prediction 2021 The Messiah seth Rollins , Dominick and Rey mysterio and Murphy vs The retribution , The predator , bane , Ali , and undefined 😅
That was good curveball💯
This is actually a great story line
Ali out of all people it him   I’m disappointed ☹️
top 10 anime betrayals
Wait this actually makes a lot of sense considering Ali was the hacker and the last of the hacker we saw was a hacker army
Heheheheh goodjob Ali .. 😅
Ya me lo esperaba
I knew it was Mustafa
Not surprised at all because he showed the stupid light in his hand in the retribution videos
So that what happened to the Smackdown Hacker, he became a leader👍
So cm punk isn’t the leader at least he’s still the smack down hacker
Yes Indeed !!!! Salute !
hell yeah!
Don't forget the Hurt Business is getting jumped by slapjack Tbar and mace
What is with WWE and turning natural babyface characters into heels. Well, I cant even tell if retribution is actually supposed to be heels or not.
Always thought the Smackdown Hacker was Mustafa Ali but i thought they scrapped that so Ali being the Retribution leader shocked me a little... but as an Ali fan i like Retribution more than Hurt Business now lol
I admit  I like his evil smirk This weirdly kinda makes sense
Ali needed this for his career
Mustafa you traitor!!!
Why whe smackdown attack their a whole unity but when raw attack its just these fools.
Finally
imean it would of been him in kofis place if randy didnt ruin alis chances. so this is good for ali
Mustafa Ali finally got the spotlight
Aww, not CM Punk?
Survivor Series - Hurt Business vs Retribution
Ali reminds me of Jafar from Aladin.
that was crazy!
The hacker was prob Ali because soon as the hacker stopped, RETRIBUTION came, and he has the same circles on his gloves as the hacker does on his screens
Cm punk is funny lol slapjack😂😂😂
Join the Dark Order
I liked how Bobby lashley was still fighting even with like 10 people on him
Ali is awesome
Boring 😴
Anybody else getting Dark order vibes or just me
Thought it would be Punk ,😨😓😭 oh we'll wait a go Ali
Great work tbh. I had absolutely no interest in retribution but now I do considering Mustafa Ali is leading them. Long time coming for Ali. Deserves a good push
You know dominik dijacobik really looks like Bane
WWE didn’t give up on the hacker storyline, this is still part of it, it was all a continuation
Ooohhh. Raw levelling to SD's story telling
No way ali
Can anyone stop the Wrath of Slapja... I Couldn’t even finish that sentence.
Yoo, ngl when Mustafa Said "Get em" gave me a goddamn chills.
Out of all people i thought it'd be Ricochet
We all thought Roman Reings was the leader of retribution
When Cole says their names it just makes them seem less intimidating😂
That was an awesome swerve. I wasn't expecting that.
That was dope.
Lmao this is so pathetic. The worst group in all wwe history. Just end it already.
I stopped watching last night. Way before this match up. Wwe tuned me out with the retribution storyline. I admit that Ali being the leader was a surprised but it’s ehhh to me. I was wondering why was Ali all of a sudden off main event and now on raw. I assume that wwe did drop actually the hacker storyline but picked it back up to added him to retribution just because it made sense and was an easy explanation. That’s my speculation. Retribution will then go on to survivor series and lose to the hurt business so “the fans can go home happy!”
Honestly I think this is terrible storytelling. I think if they were going to do something like this it should have been the undertaker if they could have or someone with more credibility than Ali. Also is the hurt business heel or face
The Hacker becomes the leader of Retribution. Wow...
It was just predictable that it was going to happen
1:13  The face you make when you're finally being used
The big white guy is ryback
This is one of the worst storylines in wwe history 😂!!!
Take the masks off give them actual names and then you have a group of underappreciated wrestlers invading this isnt nexus this isnt cool but you can make it cool, dijakovic shouting this is retribution isnt cool, dijakovic being dijakovic is cool.
One of them is clearly Dominik Dijakovic
I knew it, I knew it all along. It was pretty obvious, Ali the hacker was cancelled and they needed a gimmick then Retribution pop up and I was "I wonder who's the leader going to be"(knowing it was Ali).
Retribution sucks they wont be anything  like the shield nexxus and the core
Bullet Club Retribusion 😂😀
This Week's RAW is by far this year's best. It was extraordinary to watch. So many twists and turns  I absolutely loved it
Ali heel turn is the 2nd best thing that happened on raw :
Mustafa as leader of retribution, that’s disappointing.
This storyline is perfect for Mustafa Ali
This is better than Murphy's love story.
The best of what I've seen of Retribution. Great push for Mustafa Ali. Finally.
This is why WWE fans need sometimes to stop being so impatient, what a great plot twist here
Next nexus
wth
What a great reveal!! And it makes perfect sense too!! Who else would seek retribution other than Ali? His WWE title chance was taken from him and now he wants retribution!!
A-BAR IS THE LEADER
Btw, look at the mvp's faces. He's the one hell of actors in wwe a nowadays.
Uno reverse card
ITS ME AUSTIN
That’s a leader
I CANT BELIEVE I JUST WATCHED THAT GARBAGE ..CAN I HAVE THE TIME PUT BACK ON MY LIFE CLOCK... WWE WORLD WEAK ENTERTAINMENT !!
You dead Hurt Businiss 👍🏻👍🏻
I actually care about wwe now
Roman reigns with the shield but bigger Mustafa ali in a nutshell
WHY ALI WHY
im not mad Ali joined Retribution
HOW is Ali the leader of Retribution I thought it was CM Punk!?!?
This is great🔥🔥
i though triple h or john Cena was retrubition leader
let see what happens at wwe draft llol
Don't lie we knew something like this was gonna happen
Mustafa ali is inlisted as A Smackdown superstars ,Fix it on your website .Retribition gimmick isnt working ,Dont use it on Smackdown
I KNEW IT
How can a guy as small as Ali be the leader of RETRIBUTION?
the first time in wwe history did we ever seen a face turn on heels for other heels & becoming a heel themself in the process
Didn’t see that coming.
Todd Philips Oh my God😂
why
So is hyrt business faces now?
Finally let’s goooooo he’s going to get his push
This was stupid just stupid.
FINALLY MY BOY GETTING IN THE TOP CARD
Damn i cant believe rollins is leading them
5 on 5 Hell in the Cell Match   Retribution Vs The Hurt Business plus 2!
WHATT DID WE JUST WITNESSED!!!!
His voice is deep the way he said get em is on point
I'm confused is retribution face or heel
Does it means that the hurt business are now a baby face group
Sooooo Isnt Hurt Business Heals wow wwe is really all over the place in 2020
Is he heel
I'm happy to see Ali finally get this first major storyline!
This was one of the most interesting things to come out of this Retribution stuff. Let's see if they can capitalize on it. I'm fully behind the idea of Ali leading a group.
i knew it!!!!
😰😰😰😰c très dangereux
So is that a RETRIBUTION face turn or a Ali heel turn?
But frl can they change the name of slapjack, Tbar, and Mace
This is going to be the Survivor Series main focus probably, Hurt Bussiness vs Retribution.
Bruh I didn’t see this coming
Ali just got good
gotta love that piped in fake boos especially when they remove the feed from everyone to replace it with the Retribution sign; WWE is "the best"
makes sense since he was supposed to be the Hacker
wait WHAT!?!?!?!? ALI IS THE LEADER!?!?!?
Finally
Lashley cant handle Slapjack
Ok this waz pretty cool Ali got something going now
What the hell
Hats off to Vince for this!
The was unexpected but the coolest thing Mustafa Ali did since he joined the WWE!
It’s me Austin!!!
Wait ..  is that Predator and Bane? 1:08
Ive been asking for heel ali since for months but not really crazy about retribution
Did the "hacker" thing finally get a resolution of sort?
God I want them to slowly take the titles from everyone, and by clash of champions in any year, it's this big deal where the WWE roster tries to get the titles back in their hands. But at the PPV they failed to take one of the titles
Heels have  "light air" around them now...days are different.
Awww I wish cm punk is the leader 💔💔💔💔 so disappointment
Remember guys, all this started from when Ali was the hacker.
Terrible. Like everything the WWE put out at the moment. Hahah
I was not expecting that lol
Oh no how could he 😑
Roman is no lider
Can i treat Retribution as Neutral
Let’s be real we all saw this coming
This is most cringe team ever
I knew that something was wrong move stop Harley is the darkness so he’s with the retributions of darkness and I can see why he likes darkness not the lights so when the retribution finds out that the Heck business it’s not finished they will come back and you know they will
0:59 On The Top Left Corner You Can See A Drone Flying
A lumberjack match at hell in a cell would be pretty cool
Slapjack?!?! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shouts out to Ali for actually selling after a bump.
Some how they made it lamer
Bruh all of my favorites went heel now I’m sad
I didn’t see that coming at all 🤯🤯🤯
Looks Like Mustafa Is Leader Of Rebutioon He Looks Like A Villain Right Bro😈🤔👍👍👍👍👍
ALI HATE YOU
Ali is with the hackers called Retribution then destroyed the Hurt Business. This is awesome
T-Bar is the leader and no-one can tell me different
What?!?
Ok, Retribution isn't as bad anymore.
created the latest shoes for Jimmy Butler, LeBron James, Anthony Davis for NBA2K, let me know if you guys want to see a WWE custom themed shoes as well
The hurt business deserved all of that because they thought that they were better then ever body else but there not so they had it coming to them
Retribution vs The Hurt Business at Survivor Series then
Now THIS is something unexpected
Is this a face turn of the Hurt Business?
Should’ve been cm punk
Ali: "get 'em Tom phillips:"oh my God "
Okay so the original retribution was way different than they are now
New nexus
sooooooo... who are the heels in this scenario?
I thought he was the hacker
im just waiting for ricochet and apollo to join the hurt business to fight of ali and retribution
I swear I saw bane and predictor
So who can stop the Retribution? They got Bane and the Predator lol
Now this was a swerve I thought they dropped the whole hacker story line with whom I assumed to be mustafa but now this is very interesting retribution got some credibility now again
Ali as a heel much needed I think interesting
This probably the best for Ali and this is Awesome.
Yay something interesting happened
Ali my boy!!!!
Retributino top members: Bane Jason Predator Sub zero (leader)
Retribution vs Hurt Business members gonna have a match every week every RAW from now until Wrestlemania.
Alright Mustafa!!! He got all the talent now I hope he rises, but I won’t watch em
Ali is their leader. Unexpected. Does this mean he's a heel now?
Lmao the hurt business was like that laughing black guy who suddenly gets surprised and disappointed meme when they found out Ali was with retribution
So shocking
NEXUS = RETRIBUICHON
I hope Ali does well and they don’t ruin it
"Slapjack" will never not be funny 😂😂😂
So this is what the hacker storyline was, it all makes sense
See I told you guys before
The man who leads the light now leads the darkness
So that means Mustafa Ali turns heel n the hurt business r faces
One of them is dio madden u can tell by the hair
Now he just needs some tittle wins
Mustafa Ali is the best choice from retribution's leader but that get'em he said @1:10
This moment was literally better than anything the Dark Order has done in AEW
I figure ali would join taking the fact that WWE never gave him opportunities and took away his shot at Money in the Bank
That "get em" is badassssss🤯
I hope brock lesnar or cena join in retribution
Tt was shock too me that Ali was the leader.
Karma for hurt business
Vince gotta have a fetish with men with wet long black hair 🤨🤨🤨
So there is someone pulling the strings of retribution the hacker Mustafa Ali.
Omg really 😯😯😲
So is Mustafa Ali gonna turn heel
I think nobody cares🤣
Awesome wow can't wait for next week
The hurt business went from this :😏😁😃  To this:😣😦😐
SWEET😀
So if I'm correct:  Apollo Crew, Ricochet, Cedric Alexander & Mustafa Ali started as faces and MVP, Bobby Lashley & Shelton Benjamin _(The Hurt Business)_ as heels *But then...* Mustafa Ali disappears and Cedric Alexander *betrays* Crews & Ricochet to then *JOIN* _The Hurt Business_ to turn heel all the while _Retribution_ are indiscriminately reeking havoc on Raw  ᵃⁿᵈ ˢᵐᵃᶜᵏᴰᵒʷⁿ so they are rendered neutral, but seen as heel by default *All of a sudden...* _The Hurt Business_ are employed by Raw Management to deal with _Retribution_ and as a result end up saving Drew Mcintyre & Keith Lee after an attack by _Retribution_ and are seen as technically tweeners even though they're still feuding with Apollo & Ricochet *But THEN...* Mustafa Ali mysteriously returns and rejoins Apollo & Ricochet to settle the score against _The Hurt Business,_ *THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN* _Retribution_ reappears and Ali seemingly *JOINS* _The Hurt Business_ out of desperation *BUT THEN...* Ali rolls out of the ring and effectively DOUBLE-CROSSES _The Hurt Business_ and reveals that *HE* is the leader of _Retribution_ and sicks them on _The Hurt Business_ and effectively also becoming neutral in the process...
😴😴😴, mind u KEITH LEE gets disrespected
Hopefully we see Ali & Retribution vs CM Punk & Nexus
Now just have the others unmask so we don't have to call them slapjack and t-bar...
THIS DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!!!!!!!!!
So cool
New big group look like nexus but pretty badass group
This is one of the best WWE plot twists ever
😑😑😒😒 I just don’t know wats going on inside of Vince head these days but this ain’t it
I’m kinda surprised by this I mean I should’ve known he was the leader.
0:33 ferris wheel
I don’t know if anybody commented this but this reminds me of Aces and Eights when Devon turned heel on bully Ray and joined the group
I thought its the miz haha
Reverse version of aces & eight in revelation
He's been a heel on Main Event lately, I knew there was SOMETHING going on with Ali but I didn't know it would be this lol
This is the Ali we needed tbh. His face run got him nowhere
That way was badass af 🔥
Slapjack stole the show
Mvp: oh my god.....ALI IS APOLLO CREWS!!
Sounds like his balls finally dropped with that “get em”
Is it just me who really wants Lashley as wwe champ
So the leader isn’t CM Punk..
If the hurt business gets citric Alexander the new nation of domination will be brought back.     Wwe make that happen.
Jagi from fist of the north star
If the t bone suplex doesn’t get renamed to the t bar suplex idk what all this was for
I agree but then again I also can see riccohete and crew join then but I really thought it would be CM  Punk or even the Miz
Stop it with the shaking camera!
Nothing tames darkness better than light
Oh wow that was twist
Ali's charisma is bigger than Rollins .
Is Mustafa Ali turning heel
All is one of my favourites now
Wait,Is That Bane's Mask?🧐😂
I did NOT see this coming.
That makes sense since he was originally the SmackDown hacker.
Where is CM PUNK
This is the best thing to happen to Ali since he pinned Daniel Bryan
Que?
OK. NOW it's starting to gel! But, WWE...Y'all don't have this type of time for these weird storylines!
1:20 that voice 😱
The haker
This is the push Ali needs. I saw it coming since he was the smackdown hacker
Shane Thorne from this just seems like a background member of retribution
Lol so lame he doesn't even look like a leader
ard i fw dis shii let see what dey gon do with ali
How's that not a similar sign (hand gesture) of the Dark Order? Really? Really?
How do you go from being on Main Event to being the leader of a faction in less than a week???  He's on the same level as the other guy who has his ninjas fighting for the 24/7 title.
Imagine The Shield vs Retribution
They should turn The Hurt Business babyface, would make sense in the feud with Retribution!! 😀😀
Everybody know what happened to the haker?‼️
Nia Jax destroyed Mustafa Ali so I’m pretty sure Retribution won’t be any trouble
Alie
Mustafa ail voice sounds different
Nice Mustafa Ali
Fairplay to wwe turning it around, and presenting them how they always should have done
Never saw that coming!! 😀 😀
Am I supposed to take retribution seriously now with a DJZ ripoff
Makes sense i had a feeling given how he was rumored to be hacker and retribution has been using giltches in the lights and what not
Is the hurt bussine heel or face in the war
No wonder the ratings are falling....
Omg this is a shocker!! It's not like we knew from the beginning with all those ridiculous videos.
Hurt business face turn?
Finally Ali is gonna get the push that he deserves
Waiting for Vince to rename him G-hadd
Mustafa Ali the leader Retribution, CM Punk is the next leader.
WWE gonna drop the ball on this in 6 months tops.
SO HE WAS THE SMACKDOWN HACKER AND THE RETUBITION LEADER
lol everyone saying that the leader is cm punk and it turns out is Ali... I dint saw that coming XD
I'm waiting for this
Now get rid of the masks. And the names.
If it’s gonna be a 5 on 5 match at survivor series and they have 4 men (Ali, T Bar, Mace, and Slapjack), who’s gonna be the 5th member 🤔
Ooooooooh i like this mustafa ali turning heel
He is not ready for this roll.  He is totally going to crash and burn.  I don’t get why they could have stuck to the original plan and left Adam Cole to be the leader.
He couldn't be the hacker?
......BECAUSE HE WAS THE HACKER! We made some type of sense of this at least!
Now the questionis: Who was the SD hacker???
This should have closed off RAW
Anyone else think that hand motion was a poke at the dark order claw on aew ??????????
Next week he going to show up as the alianator and a bane bask
If this doesn't give Ali the push he deserves, they have failed 😓
Ali vs nxt, smackdown and raw
Awesome that they pushing Ali but isn’t this basically a copy of the Dark Order.
Booooooooooooooooooooo!!!!! Wheres cm punk?!?
I can’t Believe that we have to wait another week for this🙄
🤣
That's what WWE in 2020? Ewww
Why, Mustafa? Why?
This is the kind of push I wanted to see from Ali. Especially being the leader of RETRIBUTION. This will be great!
What happened  to cedric  Alexander
Yes finally :)
That was a moment
I'll take "Plot Twists that you didn't see coming" for 400 Alex...
Mustafa + Retribution = N.W.O. 2.0. Worst heel turn since Hulk Hogan established the NWO. Is Murphy in line to join Ali?
Ali heel?
the worst heel turn ever
It was the BIGGEST babyface they litterally had... Man, how disappointing is WWE... :(
I tought the retribution leader is a way better leader
so do we get a new name for Ali or no
Ok, we know a male leader but who is female leader?
Smackdown hacker storyline combines with retribution storyline equals ali leader of retribution
i doubt he is the leader. this will be a long storyline
We got fooled we thought it was roman or miz
I knew it he was a little too quiet and didn't bring up ANYTHING about retribution...
I knew it!
Stop shaking the camera.
seeing 2 Heel factions kinda feels good rather than just having a Heel vs Face factions
Well that was a waste of time
where is cedric
Knew it
I didn’t know Ali was the leader of retribution
If ali is leader of retribution, he must be the hacker if you think about it, so the leader of retribution is the hacker... great plot twist for a forgotten story💯👌🏽
Ali's retribution name is robocop.
So mustafa Ali is the imposter
Wow! Another group from NXT brought up to WWE. Here we go again - everyone will lay down for the next several months.
6102020 பார்த்தேண் சூப்பர்ஸ்டார் Super
Time to turn hurt business face and have apollo and ricochet join.  Have a wargames match
Brodi ali.
Someone on the screen was playing the Nexus theme at the end 😂😂😂😂 listen closly at 2:40 to the end
it makes sense coz mustafa was about being the light and now hes with retribution hes about darkness now
Lol
Glad Ali is getting tv time!
That was a nice heel turn
1:01  What the f... 😂😂😂😢😢😂😂😂
Apollo Crews or Ricochet could join Retribution or maybe both of them. Cedric Alexander is expecting to turn on The Hurt Business and join Retribution.
Epic
I can see why Ali had to turn heel, WWE "creative" couldn't write a compelling babyface character if held a gun to their heads
They choose the less credible and charismatic wrestler on the roster for this role
Wao cool
it's a time to push him
🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾
I knew it
Now don't ruin him. Make him a STAR
Love the twist that catches everybody by surprise! This was great. So glad Ali is getting a major role, he deserves it.
Ricochet will join the Hurt business. Apollo will try to be recruited by both HB and Retribution
And no one cared
Ali is Revealed as retribution leader Meanwhile . . . . . Dolf ziggler : it should've been me
There’s an Impostor among us
ohhh this was good :3 ....
Why dosnt MVP have the punisher logo anymore?
The hurt buisness are faces or hells 😂
This was actually good but I can’t take them seriously when you got names like t-bar and slapjack.
Isn't Michael Tarver former member of Wade's Nexus in The Retribution as T-bar?
This is crazy
rlly Mustafa Ali of all the wrestlers it’s him
how many superstar in retribution?
We are finally know who is The Hacker.
This gonna be gooooood...
Mustafa Ali was the Impostor.
At least Ali has direction. Plus him being a heel has prospects. I got hopes.
Well great :/
Everthing about Retribution is connect with SD Hacker Guy Lol.
A.C.A.B
That was actually good, yet I can feel Vince will mess it up somehow, but good for Ali
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NXT is trash take it off the air i only raw and smckdown thow i want to see hell in the cell
Stupidest angle ever. Vince needs help
mace:*throws MVP to the barricade and trys to get  a new social media picture of him crawling*
So is the hacker story scrapped? Or it's part of this storyline? Either way this saved Ali's career and the storyline
😂😂😂😂😂
Just when I thought Retribution couldn’t get more of a joke, this might take the cake!
This actually makes Ali interesting
Now it makes sense on why Ali kept randomly returning to pin MVP. I liked this group before because I liked the main 5, but now I'm even more invested with Ali in it. I'm calling it rn, Ricochet is joining one group and Apollo is joining the other one
Ali was the hacker... Blend that with retribution, good stuff
Wow just wow
This gotta be the dumbest thing I've ever seen but let's see where it goes I guess
YES! YES! YES!
The voice of Ali changed in that moment.
Really Ali as leader that is a joke but saying that wwe has become a joke over the last 5 years
It was kind of obvious that Ali was the leader especially after the Hacker storyline was dropped on Smackdown.
OMG IS B-POP, T-BOP, T-BAR, HIPPIPITY BIPPITY BOOO.
Sooooo is the SmackDown hacker gone for good
1:20 Ali's voice sounds so badass! just like a true villain
ok
So Mustafa Ali was the hacker?
Well this is a waste of months !!
Can we chill with the shaking camera? My head is starting to hurt.
I knew it
This junk remind me of aces and eights
Ali deserves a main event push..... His so good in the ring... His like Seth Rollin...... I like the way he wrestle....... More power to retribution
Heel turn confirm
I want Jinder 😭
Finally Mustafa Ali got a good position
austin theory lol
Mustafa turn heel
Ali might be able to save this faction...
Booooooooooooooo
Mustafa ali leadeer??? Hahahaha...lol..  Its should be lana the leader..hahahah  Wwe now its like comedy show for me
Este Mufasa es un loquillo
WTF just happened
Ali was the light now he's the darkness
WWE will probably screw this up but damn Mustafa Ali deserves this role.
Wow MVP expression is gold.
Good for Mustafa Ali great heel turn for him, he needs it.
Vince : did we ruin Shinsuke  ?  Triple H : yeah   Vince : what about ricochet and cedric ?   Triple H : Already done boss.   Vince : What about this Arabian guy  called Mustafa ?   Triple H : I will take care of this Triple H :
Retribution vs Kane John Cena and undertaker
Goldberg gosto disso
FIIIIIINNNNAAAAALYYYYYYY
WHAAAAAAAAAT!!!!
So the women are gone from the group?
This was the heel turn we never knew we needed
It's ME, Austin! It was ME, all along, Austin!
Finally, we needed this
Is that minions there throwing air punches?what a joke.maybe Disney has already bought this company like a 1992 X-Men cartoon
Leader of a yeah what should i call them? 4 feet tall, smaller then Alexa Bliss  and 80 pounds 🤣
Retribution needed something like this.
I can't believe it
lmao looking like the actor from netflix "messiah"
Do they have to shake the camera so much man it's murder on the eyes trying to focus on the action
He was the hacker, retribution looked like they were led by the smackdown hacker....never underestimate
Feels forced. But hey, it’s a payoff. Kinda?
when they started wearing TDKR Bane masks I wondered if it'd be revealed someone was behind it all - same as Talia was commanding Bane - but this was a great twist nevertheless.
I been knew it was him because the mystery man on smackdown has the same sign as Mustafa Ali
I KNEW IT! ALI WAS THE HACKER AND THE LEADER OF RETROBUTION
Where are Mercedez Martinez and Mia Yim? What about them?
The Hacker ladies and Gents
YEAH T BAR TAKEOVER!!!! RETROBUTIONNNNNNNNN
Lashley give it to em Mustafa turns around get em hurt business God damn we were just playing and you know this
They really played the long game with the hacker storyline
Last minute decision by Mr McMahon
I am with retribution
I would much rather have had Seth Rollins be the leader of retribution. Better storylines.
Mustafa Ali  is a traitor
I am kinda getting this Dark Order from AEW vibe with Retribution...
I'm just thinking is this wwe rewarding Mustafa Ali after last year when he was out of the elimination chamber match and all the focus was on kofimania
wtf???
They needed a top superstar for the leader not Ali no offense
All it took was Ali to make me interested in Retribution
'There's SlapJack on the outside"
Ali made retribution relevant
Finally some good use of this man
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Raw is a joke
Good
Am I the only one that thinks that RETRIBUTION is a bad copy of the Dark Order
So it’s not Wade Barrett then??
Kinda cool the big badass isnt the leader and its somebody that SHOULD be salty as hell...
I knew he had something to do with them
so heel turns on heels, thats a new gimmick in the WWE nowdays
50 Kilogram Ali is the man
Ok...Retribution is getting a little better now
Ohhhhhhh
i really hate their mask,but retribution is one great stable
ali the hacker
One of the members on retribution looks like PREDATOR from the movie aliens vs PREDATORS
I'm getting motion sickness.
Free bitcoin on my channel
mustafa ali > cm sucks
The Summerslam slogan lives on "you will never see it coming."
00:06 and 0,25x playing fake 😂
Retribution sucks!!
this angle really does not interest me, been done before and done better. I predict it will not last 6 months.
OMG
He doesnt fit in man just sayin
Tired of seeing the same "smackdown vs raw" feud every year at Survivor Series ? This year 5 vs 5 : Retribution vs Hurt Business Make it happen !
There a lot of turn on this couple of weeks..i love it
as I heard in september the retrebuition want wwe that means mustafa ali wants retrebuiyion
Samoa Joe is Taz 2.0
Hope to see Retribution vs The Hurt Business at Survivor Series
WAHT
I can't belive ali is heel
Nice one Mustafa 😀
1:10 I quit my 9-5 because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
XD
So, all this time, Ali made his face paper, but in the reality, he was heel ? It's funny but it's weird. Mustafa Ali as a heel.🥴😵
I'd say this was a great way for WWE to ruin Retribution, but they've done that already with weeks of terrible booking.
I did not see it coming
Ohh i think CM punk...i really not bellieve Ali finally leader retribution
BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  Cm Punk Would Have Been Better
Turning heel is a push in WWE. (Y) This is awesome
Oke now retribution is going to be interesting
Well this took a spin on the interesting side 😁👀😂
well this stupid group just got interesting
Who wants Ricohect and Crews in Retribuition like if you agree
Bryon Saxton nearly said wtf🤣
Welcome back Mustafa Ali
This either saves Retribution, or destroys Ali.
Hurt business never looked so good
All of the big guys in wwe and nxt they don't find other than mustafa ali to be the leader
Bruh wtf we somehow all knew lmao
Lets Go Ali!!!!!!!!!! Leader of Retribution 🖐🏽✊🏽
Now please take the mask off and use their real names... for f*** sake
Ali evolved in into boss mode
downgraded nexus😂🤣🤣
This is awesome
Franchement je pensais pas du tout que Ali était leur boss, mais d'un côté il fait partie de ceux qui voudraient se venger de la wwe
Jajaj great to see Ali turn heel man its about DAMN time
So..?
Where is the second líder cm punk?
Mustafa Ali, in Retribution for WWE, who would of guessed? That the short high flying champ,  pulling off a number like that,wow Im totally blown away, its like real BONKERS-lol
"GET'EM"
@1:21 when you get your older brothers and there friends to attack your Bullys lol   But let's gooo ali maybe get the wwe title shot he deserved before he was out last year
Next they’ll be asking for bobs and vagine. What a pile of trash
Ha GAAAAAAAY!!!
Yes yes yes
Well...that's disappointing...
So much time passed since the hacker thing that i legit forgot that Ali was set to be the leader lmao
Hiyar ali
I just don’t see him as a good heel.
Finally, there using ali
Those masks are stupid
Mustafa Ali leading retribution....thats like if Spike Dudley was the leader or DX....its utterly ridiculous...and has definitely made Retribution look like one of the most absurd groups ever....who doesn't enjoy surprises when you watch wrestling....but this....Mustafa Ali is a mid-career at best...compete for the cruiserweight title and stay away from the last interesting storyline that wwe has....and it has just been ruined. AND I WATCH THIS EVERY WEEK along with all wrestling...and this was a baaaad idea....this will not help Mustafa Alis career....its only gona bury him deeper....in one year he'll b another Curtis axl or DiBiase jr....another nobody.
I love Ali, so glad to see this
Takes out the entire hurt business without touching them lol
*To be honest Ali was one of those Superstars who didn't get much opportunities, with this I hope he gets better opportunities and the other Retribution, Ngl I'm starting to like the Retribution Faction, keep it up! ^_^*
Like that
Not Miz, not Roman but Mustafa...
I don’t get the heel/face dynamic with The Hurt Business. They were about to gang up on Ali, but we are meant to feel sympathy for them for being ganged up on. Two heel factions at war just doesn’t make much sense.
HELL TO THE YEAH!!! This was a brilliant swerve!!!!
Heel time
EveRybody "THE LIGHTS" is becoming dark.. 😱😱😱this is so damn coool 😀😀
*I am no longer Mustafah Ali, i am........ Jafar!!!*
now give him a title match against mcintyre
This is a good move, nobody likes Mehtrebution but everyone like Ali.
I thought it was CM Punk
This is what I've been waiting for a heel ali
Retribution Mustafa Ali, Bane, Predator, Jason Vorhees, and (Janitor) Randy Orton
TBAR: Bane Mace: The Predator
Shelton's reactions comedy gold
Sooo many superstar and ali is the leader thats just stupid
Slightly disappointed that it ain't CM Punk. But I'm enjoying this a bit.
This is the most random twist ive ever seen but it sorta worked 😂
First, Cedric Alexander joins The Hurt Business and now Mustafa Ali joins Retribution
BRO?!!!! I THOUGHT HE IS THE HACKER DKDKFKFKFOEKDKCK...but then again they probably dropped the storyline and he is on Raw
No one cares about ALI!!!!    He is trash
Where's Batman? Bane's Here!!!!
I thought they axed this faction. Also, get em Slap jack!
@2:44 what a picture
I wonder if they will try to use the real fact that Ali was originally supposed to be in Kofi's spot in Elimination Chamber to justify this.
I knew it all a long. The fact that Retribution never attacked Ali and plus Ali was never around made it obvious
I spent the whole 3 minutes in saying " WTF WTF WTF"  but still an awesome decision for one of the greatest talent in the world
The other guy is R-Truth.
Is it just me or is Retribution have less than half the members of when they debuted
So they're just gonna take the Dark Order's idea. okay
This was actually really good
LMAO REALLY
I hope they change that seth rollins wannabe look
wasn't he suppose to be the hacker....nah i ain't complaining this man is finally getting some tv time that he really deserves
Really despise the fake crowd noise.
Who else is waiting for cm punk to appear
Everybody who wanted punk is now upset. Tho people like me new he'd never be back
I think slap jack is shane thrond
The best heel turn for Mustafa Ali
Mustafa was that hacker from “truth will be heard” from smackdown?
Finally Mustafa Ali in a good storyline
I'm pleasantly surprised
MUSTAFA ALI IS THE RETRIBUTION LEADER!!!????😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Uno card REVERSED!!!! Get em with force man a wild card I never saw coming
Mustafa Ali looking good
What?
The truth will be heard.
Mustafa Ali could save Retribution
He’s still a bum
I thought it was sheamus.
Stop...Shaking...The...Camera
I smell 5 on 5 survivor traditional match here
MVP being named MVP and his ring gear just doesn't allow me to take him seriously
Retribution know nxt is Mustafa ail
I might be the only one but not gonna lie I’m excited about hurt business vs retribution if wwe continue the storyline like this
Give them their NXT gimmicks back this low grade Batman villain gimmick aint it
Potential to be better than the Nexus
and the suprises just keep coming
They have nothing for him so they did this . Shame
I Told You That Mustafa Ali Is The Smackdown Hacker And Now He Is The Leader Of Retribution. This Wil Be Very Interesting.
Definitely prefer this over him being the hacker
Wait, so who's the heel and who's the face??
He would have been better off as the Smackdown hacker
Hey they might get cooler masks now
Don't screw it up now please.
actually thats locks boi at 1:20 looks kinda cool
MVP and the other two got Ousted.
Mustafa Ali best
wwe is so cringe nowadays 😐
Disappointed 😔
Hurt Business: We have Bobby Lashley  Mustafa Ali: I have an Army.
I was right he was the hacker and leader of retribution
Everyone in wwe turn heel 🤷🏻‍♀️
HOLLY using zoom!
NOW I WANT RETRIBUTION MASKS AND ACTION FIGURES
Happy for Ali
Love how strong they made Lashley look.. shows they still respect his character
Retribution looks corny
And now Ali getting a push. Finally.
Lol. Its funny on how the people thought that CM punk is the leader of the Retribution, SIKE! Its just the hacker boi. HAHAHAHA
please, give Mustafa Ali "the message" gimmick back... that gimmick makes more sense for him being the leader than his current one... and make him like mvp, manager/active player role...
idl what to think of this
Here’s the big question did Apollo and ricochet knew or were they a part of retribution this whole time???🤔🤔🤔
I'm confused. When did retribution get the predator?
Will Ali now be called Xris Cross or something else that's stupid? T-Bar is named after a stripper's panties. This is so stupid.
🦰🦰💣💣💣🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🧐🧐🦰🦰🦰🤖🤖🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰💖🤖🦰🦰🦰💖🦰🤖🇲🇾🦰🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾💖🦰🦰💣🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰💖🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🤖🤖🦰💣🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🦰🤖🦰🤖🤖🇲🇾💖💖💖💖🇲🇾💖💖🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾💗🇲🇾
I hope you did not make Ricochet Heel. His my 1 favorite
Ffs 😂
cool
Honestly can’t believe Mustafa Ali is the mastermind behind RETRIBUTION until now!!!
I love it. Good job
I know im not the only one amped to see mustafa turn heel
A great double turn
Bobby Lashley: Give It To Him. 1:05
The Smackdown hacker .....Ali ....oh no ..... Hurt Business ....a face .... Ali loves Dune ......
I love Dio Maddin(Mace) & Dominik Dijackovic (TBar) ring gear. This group is much better than Nexus and better ruthless aggression to upgrade themselves further in the future in championship opportunities.
Horrible
The year of wrestlers turning heel
he became a heel! :O
HAH LETS GOOOO
I'm not mad at this.
oh déjà vu !!! aces and eights !!!!!!!!
Have they ever done a heel vs heel stable ( besides that epic encounter with Wyatts and Shield), this looks good
This may be the first Muslim wrestler from face to heel. Kinda cool tbh. But not in a racist way as I'm a Muslim too
Ali Baba & the forty fake fighters
Good god the camera almost gave me motion sickness!
At least this ties into the hacker story line, so I respect that.
Mustafa ali hell love 😍
That was awesome
Allah Huakbar!✊
The bullied bullies the bullies. Love it.
Ali...😍😍😍😍
Murphy turns face and Ali turns heel in one night.
Honestly i kinda new he was part of retribution the whole time. When they were in the ring i could recognise his face with the mask. Honestly pretty easy to find out
It wasn't going to be a big personality leading seeing as this whole storyline has flopped since day one.
Even the cameramen are scared, look at their hands shake. 😄
I don't buy these "Mustafa Ali" betrayed stuff, But I think most of Retribution members are coming from RAW Underground.
1:42 LMAO, what was that? 😂
I can't take Ali seriously he too cute when he's mad
Why would any of the big men in retribution do what he says?
Perfect time to shut off the viewers on the monitors when they reveal Ali so one could see their reaction. XD
This was hella powerful
So is retribution some type of antifa? 🤣🤣🤣
The best HEEL turn in 2020, ITS AWESOME
So Retribution is a bunch of guys playing cosplay? I see Bane. I see a Predator lmao
Soooo, does this mean the Hurt Business is turning face🤔
I knew that it was him as the hacker
So that why he was a hacker and doing this...
헐 대박
The smackdown hacker was the leader of retribution 🤷
Lashley got that classic Mortal Kombat 2 fighting pose at 0:51
Mustafa been bomb in fighting one of only three from 205 that still in view. Putting ali in that position is f Ed up those angles ruin people he muslim that's bad optics
Dio Maddin original Predator with those beads and dreadlocks okay
Every time Retribution and Hurt business fight it looks weak and slow 1:30
😅😁
Where’s all the other members of Retribution?
Awesome.
Seriously?!?! The most pathetic storyline that I have ever see in wwe!
Ali just save retribution, that's what a leader does..
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
ANYONE ELSE CURIOUS WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH RICOCHET AND APOLLO CREWS
This was interesting I like it
i wish that seth is retribution
One of the best heel
Are we gonna get ricochet and Apollo crews as a team. Cedric and Ali have left their side. If so, I wouldn’t be disappointed if they were booked right
So what happens to apollo crews and  ricochet now
Nice!!! What a big revelation!!! Here comes Mansoor to penetrate the Retribution and fight Mustafa Ali !!!
Bro I was downloading characters on wwe 2k19 and I seen mustfa Ali and his name was retribution
I am So Glad to this happened Next One Is Ricochet and Apollo Joşns Hurt Business
I knew he was the hacker,im sure no one remember that storyline
Wasn’t expecting that😳
Good to see them copying dark order
mustafa ali is the best heel turn literally fits charachter
Would be super cool if they turn Retribution into some kind of vigilante tweener group with Ali as their leader.
I think Kevin owens should of been the leader or Alister black
NGL I kinda like Ali being retribution’s leader
Apollo needs to join The Hurt Business!!!!!
HELL YEAH.
Retribution with Ricochet and Apollo Crews vs. The Hurt Business. Book it Vince!
I was waiting for Slapjack's Paper Plate Piledriver. Best finisher since the F5!
Yessssss
Not gonna lie when Mustafa Ali put up his hand towards the end of the video I thought he was about to do some kinda knock off of the dark order's claw taunt
garbage midcarder for life lol
What the hell??  I thought that is roman reigns
Lol, Ali was basically a low carder of main event and now is the leader of the ascending stable of raw. I don't understand sincerely.
I love it
Subscribe to my channel it is Syed ziyad with 41 subs
Anyone who watched mustafa Ali return would of noticed that he was wearing a similar mask
Woody: "This is ludicrous..."
Bello
I honestly wanna see apollo and ricochet to join retribution it would be the best storyline
That makes so much sense
I just hope that Ali is getting this push as it did The Fiend......
Have to admit that was one hell of a curveball. WWE has become so predictable over the years but I don't think anyone saw this coming. I like it though. And predicting he was the hacker is not the same as saying he was the leader of Retribution.
Hell yeah this is amazing
I still can't believe, this is great!!!
The one of the best events of WWE in 2020
Hurt business had this comin for a LONG time, but this is an incredible push for Ali
Ah so they are basically weaponless jihadist  *TAKE THIS AS A JOKE*
Okay... but we’re still sticking with Slapjack??
At least Mustafa Ali has something to do on tv. Let’s see how long until it gets screwed up.
Mustafa Ali Leader of RETRIBUTION🔥🔥
Mvp so slow
WHY? 🤬
yassss!
Dio madden in retribution looks like captain jack sparrow on pirates of the Caribbean 😂😂
Mustafa vs Drew mcintyre for the wwe championship
Mustafa Ali👈👏👏👏
What the hell is with all those screens in the back lol does anyone finds this odd?🤔
new member......
Obviously you need to move The Hurt Business to smackdown as they are great as a heel group and them taking on Retribution makes no sense. Fancy that.
Does this mean the hurt business are the good guys now? I don't like tht
When you order Nexus on wish
Ali is too weak to lead anything, much less Rejectribution. Such a stupid reveal and even sillier names for members. WWE has finally lost its collective mind. 😡
Bro el que se parece a kingston el altote  se ve perron con su mascara y su pelo
Otto Von ruthless, Ice Dagger and Fang Mcfrost..well it don’t get more suck *ss than that....oh wait it does 😂
Heel Ali is connected
I think we were all a bit too quick to judge this storyline. Cause this. Got. Good.
Lol Slapjack really come on Vince
Literally, one of the two real life super heroes you have on your roster, you put him as the head of the Bainiacs with the stupid masks and stupid names? Okay... lol
I think its big cass
Mustafa Ali was the imposter all along... I knew it
Ali wore a black hoodie as the Smackdown hacker, Retribution wears black hoodies. Ali's entrance gear is his mask, Retribution wear masks.
What?!
Between the booking of Roman, Fiend and Alexa, and now Ali being revealed as the leader after all those tweets of not being given his opportunities and "mocking" his matches on Main Event... WWE, my hat is tipped for you. Great job.
Not gonna lie, when mustafa ali turned around he reminded me a little bit of neville/pac
Ali with the predator and bane?
I wasn't expecting this 😳
I'm sold
Lol RIP Ali. You were one of the only things I liked in WWE
Cause I know as a monster ill take orders from a little midget who's barely on the roster
zzzzz
Ali with the dark order hand sign
Ali is now Klicklack
Best raw i ve seen in a long time
The draft is around the corner Retribution
😳😳😳😳 how 😳😳😳🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️
Imagine if R-Truth was the leader.
Really??? REALLLLYYY? Lost all credibility for retribution. They could have made Miz, ziggler, KO, maybe alister black, but Ali, completely lost interest
Mustapha Ali is gonna be like Muhammad Hassan
Turn this into WWE's version of Money Heist, where instead of money, they go for titles, and Ali is like Professor.
This a good survivor series matchup😂 What if tozawa and ninjas go to smackdown, then they have a feud with retribution at survivor series.
I really can’t take them names seriously
God Damn, I can't believe it that Ali is Retribution leader!!!
I'm glad Mustafa Ali is doing something. But I still feel bad for Dijakovic. Great talent hidden behind a stupid name, pointless mask, and nauseating camerawork.
But we knew about this months ago when ali was doing the whole computer thing that exposed Sonya and ziggler.  Still a great storyline
Wow! So many Good storyline right now!!
anybody knew about this before? i didn't..
this will setup ricochet and apollo to unite with the hurt business against retribution possibly on survivor series, great job WWE im fully invested in this angle!
Retribution suddenly got very interesting!
Wow doesn’t this look familiar is one of retribution name evil A or something trying to do something like the dark order
Always was terrible choice as leader for Retribution and he'll never be more then mid card talent when this is over...
Yooo what?
Nice move
This I think is the answer to the " THE TRUTH WILL BE HEARD" On Smackdown Live!
Meh....
The Hurt Bussiness  Got HURT!!  LOL
Mustafa Ali had such a fake facial expression at the end when retribution was in the ring. I don't know if I can take him serious in the role of the leader.
Damn I didn’t expect this at all
Samoa Joe:  I called it , I called it.     you called it Joe you were wrong.    LOL
Pick him up and put him back down at the start lol
The hurt business needs more fighters to join them that’s it wasn’t a fair fight
Nice PLOT TWIST WWE!!!
Dat smile going down is so good tho
ppl say this is heel turn but is it really. retribution is filled w many talented ppl who were over looked, pushed to the side, and not pushed so really they just frustrated and this is how they respond if anything wwe is the heels 🤯🤯🤯
阿里老大
"T-bag, Slap-Nuts & Pepper Spray! Oh myyy Godddd!"
Green giblin change of voice 1:20
Why does Ali at the end remind me of CM Punk, with the look and wrist sleeve and all
WOW COOL MUSTAFA ALI!!
It’d be a lot easier to enjoy Retribution if they didn’t have those masks. Also the names but the dumb Bane masks bug me more.
2020 was the year when Mustafa Ali is the leader of Retribution and The Hurt Business didn't see this coming at all 😶
Wait! By the way,where is Cedric Alexander?
I like Mustafa Ali turn Babyface his theme song, character, gear and talented. But why Mustafa Ali why ?
I like how at the end Ali is like “join the dork order”
wwe  version of the dark order 🤔 very original
The hurt business is so powerful
I'm loving this especially when  Mustafa Ali is the leader for Retribution. That's why they're were going for The Hurt Business all the time. Amazing 💥🔥🙌
bs
So hurt business is now face? Apollo and Ricochet will join them for SS match against retribution and Ali?
WWE doing a good angle? Impossible  MVP helping many talents? Incredible  Are they gonna find a way to ruin it? Most likely
I am really shock and little bit mad because Mustafa Ali is a leader of retribution and turning heel. I am Angry. Is me or everybody WWE SuperStar turning heel like really? 👎👎😮😠😡😤
Shaking the camera is so stupid and annoying 👎👎👎👎👎👎
WOW who would have thought that clearly nobody 😲
I was hoping that Ali would be their leader because it was the only thing that could save Retribution but WWE never gives us good things, Heel Reigns + Heel Ali with a long deserved push THANK YOU I'm actually going to want to watch RAW next week 😃
ali was an imposter
I knew it
Stupid!
antifa is gotta chill :(
Mustafa ur fking gross.....i trusted u....
😅😅😅 what ?
Top Members of Retribution: Mustafa Ali Jason Vorhees The Predator Bane
이거 관중반응 있었으면 지렸겠다
Mustafa Ali is Aizen in Bleach
Surprises me
Yees!! Give Mustafa Ali the push he deserves 🙌🏻
Get Em! Ali sounded like Scorpion
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is this like a lowkey double turn? Kinda vibe with it
Among us in a video
This was a good twist 👍🤘 Luvin this direction
Okay that's the best heel turn I've seen in a while.
Top 10 anime plot twist
It’s smart and at the same time it manages to make the justification for why they dropped the hacker angle and just slid Ali in as the leader of Retribution.  It was said that Ali was supposed to be the mastermind of the hacker but this totally works for him.  Now here is hoping that they don’t botch this up anymore Than they’ve already done.
It also makes sense because retribution have only ever attack people who are against Ali of late so it makes total sense
A career maker if handled right. No nexus treatment please.
I did not see that coming
Wow, this really make retribution storyline bounce back, i love this. Now i'm start to care what they doing now
Wack
Where The Hell Every Persons Here That Said Miz Is The Leader Of Retribution? Come Out Here...!
Now i have a joke match which i want it will happen: Ali and Retribution vs Akira Tozawa and Ninja 😂😂😂
Mustafa was the leader the whole time I never knew until now, but still this man needed a well needed push
If the shield was there it would of been better
So Many Superstar Heel
Such a waste of a storyline
I have to Sue WWE for using my name.
1:12 .. that smile too ... "finally they give me a chance to do something"
Ali should be no 1 contender for us belt now..it only will be a good story if a champ leading them
Is mustafa Ali a heel or a face ???
Wow, a double turn. I have not seen this in ages
Now get John cena back to bury all of Retubution
Is Ali a heel now? Is Retribution face? Are The Hurt Business faces? Found out next on Dragon Ball WWE
I did not see that coming...
I absolutely MARKED OUT!!!
كفو يامصطفى علي ههههه😅 شقهم شقة
I didn't see this coming but I love it
I can see Crews and Ricochet joining hurt business to fight retribution.
Ali did good here. Less is more and I hope he does well witj this.
Wade barrett should’ve been the leader of retribution. He could’ve wanted revenge for ruining the nexus
I guess Ali will resign
Well that was a surprise.   In an ideal world, Should Ali be a heel? No.  If he has to be a heel, should he be the leader of Retribution? Yes.  Tbh, i'm just glad the incredibly talented Ali finally is focused on. ABOUT. DAMN. TIME.
Retribution is now even more of a joke
I get they're trying to make it feel more chaotic with the shaky cam but honestly it induces motion sickness
I still feel like retribution beaded a leader like wade barret or Roman reigns
I love you Mustafa ali
Now this was definitely a shocker. I thought Keith lee but Ali is even better
did not expect this coming and it is great
I already knew mustafa was the hacker but not the leader of retribution!!
MVP: Are you with us? Ali: Hail Hydra
So this was a double turn. Hurt business are a face. Retribution are heels. Makes sense for Apollo and ricochet to join the hurt business. Best and amazing storytelling
I just still can't get over their ridiculous names tbh XD
Tbh i didnt expect this
i love it good job wwe raw was a really good show
Mustafa Ali being the leader of retribution was so mind blowing and unexpected the least person u would have thought and these segment makes the hurt business kinda look like babyfaces
What if Brock Lesnar returns to attack Retribution
drew mcintyre didn't save the hurt business and the wwe
Cedric or Mustafa. One of them has to become champion soon. They've never been better.
Awesome!!! The breakthrough Ali needed. AMAZING👍
This is good!!
Top 10 anime betrayals
So ali was the hacker
Where is Alexander? Isn't Cedric Alexander a member of the Hurt Buisness?
I thought it was going to be CM Punk.
If anyone can take retribution and make it work, it’s Ali
Lame
Awful
Mustafa Ali is the leader of RETRIBUTION:  Nobody:   Absolutely nobody:   Not even a single soul:    WWE Fans: tHiS iS gReAt, wWe WiLl HaVe A bEtTeR sToRyLiNe AnD mOrE hEeLs WiLl StArT tO rIsE aNd PoSsIBbLy JoIn RETRIBUTION
Man this needed a live crowd. But enjoyed it anyway
Is there a member of retribution named taserface 😂
Its like playing them classic ps1 wwf games season mode and the storylines make no sense
I am SO happy for this man
Finally, something good has happened with Retribution. Very unexpected, fair play WWE
The smile though
Didn't see that coming
This is the best thing for ali and I can’t wait to see how this pans out. It also links in with the hacker storyline as ali was supposed to be the hacker and the technical issues are part of retribution and their attack’s which makes sense as to why ali is the leader constructing the attacks. This is maybe a stretch but could be just good subtle storytelling but this is the best thing for ali
Ilove you ali
Ali being the leader of Retribution is very interesting I dig it though I thought it would been T-Barr that name lol man them going through the easy way.
What? Mustafa Ali is the team of retribution?
So far, this is the best moment of Mustafa Ali in WWE. Being the leader of Retribution? I'M IN.
Props to Vince who didn't give Ali a stereotype gimmick, this retribution gimmick really fits him tho
Where tf is Cedric Alexander?
You know I was actually thinking this was a thing. I had either Ali or Kevin Owens pegged as the leader
I Like Mustafa Ali play heel
Can’t believe Mustafa Ali turn  heel join retribution as leader
It was easy to know he was the leader he had alot of opportunity s
Bro this is crazy
Retribution is a garbage faction
ok so where does that leave Ricochet and Crews now? because if Ali is leader and the hurt business is 4 people would that mean those 2 would join up with Hurt business?
Wuau AWESOME 👏🏻👏🏻✊🏼
😨
Have you turn him heel
Ricochet and Apollo Crews aligning with "The Hurt Business!". . . Interesting!🤔
Looks like bane from the batman series
God... Could the WWE get anymore lame? Bring back Ronda Rousey and Becky Lynch. That's the last time I was even mildly entertained by the WWE product.
PUSH FOR ALI
Vote for president trump  Vote for Donald trump the wwe hall of famer as the president of United States of America for another great 4 years
Bruh really? mustafa?????
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Love it
Ali doing nothing wrong in here, he just want payback after Hurt Business bullied him first.
Ali for WWE Champion
okay i hell like this...... raw was very decent this week. FOR ONCE!
I really like the storyline reveal of Ali but please stop the camera shaking and quick cuts.
No man no Ali is a heel
Just when I thought this angle couldnt get any worse, the leader turns out to be an Indian cruiserweight
Am I the only one who noticed Shane Thorne?
Poor Ricochet and Crews, always got backstabbed by their teammates
It was good to see they finally rectified the Failing Storytelling with Retribution by revealing Mustafa Ali to be the leader. The question is was this the plan the whole time for Ali to be involved with Retribution or did they just decide this on the Fly? I gotta say this is 1 of the best swerves to come from WWE in quite some time. If this actually was the long term plan from The Hacker storyline from earlier this year then this is 1 of the few times I can honestly say WWE actually went back & finished an abandoned storyline adding a proper conclusion to it & with all the tag teams that WWE has been breaking up easily fits right into the Hacker storyline as he was threatening that tag teams would be breaking up soon. If this was the actual long term plan from WWE, way to go WWE for actually doing something right for a change & if it wasn’t & it was just something done on the fly then consider this catching lightning in a bottle or barrel whatever the expression is & use this as a learning opportunity on how to rectify bad storytelling from happening in the future.
I like Dio being the Predator!
Please follow through with this instead of just dropping it.
Who said Roman reigns??? Haha Its mustafa ali
RETRIBUTION vs the Hurt Business in classic Survivor Series match, anyone? Time to see which faction is the dominant one!
WOW! THIS IS AMAZING 😍     ALI GOT HIS NAME BACK AS MUSTAFA ALI🙂
This angle sucks.
Hurt business out here getting smashed 😂😂😂 good look for Ali!
Watch out for slapjack! Destruction! 😬
About time they gave Ali a push.
WHY ALI WHY?
Yes they finally let him continue his storyline with what he did on smackdown
I LOVE THIS. Now link it to his hacker gimmick and we're golden!
Mustafa Ali WAS The IMPOSTER
MVPs face lmao
I can really say I was actually shocked to see Ali as the Leader!!
You mean the guy that was a cop is now leading the Antifa themed faction on WWE?   LE GASP!
I am in shock !!!!!
Mustafa ali first became friends with ricochet and apollo crews then becomes the leader of the new next gen nexus
Sooo... Does WWE just cut the feed to the viewers in the Thunderdome when Retribution comes in?
so Ali was the imposter all along
When no one chooses you to join a class group and you gotta work with whats left
Finally ali got pushed
Domnik dajikovick :T bar Shane Thorne : slapjack Ali : jet bag
Wwe Dark order 2.0 come on Vince do you like AEW ideas and you try to copy them?!?!🤷‍♂️😂😂😂
Is Ali getting a new name?
hmmmm didn't ALi Debuted as a heel in the cruiserweight division?
Lashley's face sold the entire thing perfectly.
So was retribution the smack down hacker 🤔🤔
Is it just only me, that i feel like im watching bane and predator.
So who was the smackdown hacker? Lmfao
Nice heel ali 👍🔥🔥
Really mustafa ali leader of retribution hows that tiny scruny bugger a leader
Now Ricochet and crews have to join the hurt business
👏 👏 👏  nice job on the leader
Absolute cringe.
I knew it
The look on MVP face
Good job creative
Sooooo....any backstory to why this man is mad???
This explains a lot about the whole entire hacker storyline but why Mandy and Sonya
1:14 I love how mvp’s smile just fades away
Yous are not strong the monster among men is and that is braun strowman that would be a good moment if braun strowman came out
When cm punk is going to return so 😡
Mustafa omg
Ali in Retribution not what I expected
Where is Cedric?
PAKISTAN ZINDABAAD 💪🇵🇰
Ali is done, let's see how they mess this up
JINDER MAHAL WOULD HAVE DONE IT FAR BETTER THAN ALI
lameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
can ali even pull it off as retribution's leader? he should've just become a member of retribution instead...
Glad to see them using him. Hopefully this goes somewhere for him.
Fact : Champs in SD are all heel  Roman Bayley Sami Nakamura and Cesaro  And champs in RAW are all face  Drew Asuka Lashey (when fudeing with Retribution) Street Profits
Boring
Ditch the masks and stupid names and you can salvage this
WWE Listened to their fans
Talk about an unexpected heel turn....I love it....I just wish this would have occurred against some babyfaces..... Probably building up a Retribution vs Hurt Business Traditional  Survivor series match ... that's assuming they don't get separated in the draft
0:04 XD
Retribution is such a funny group🤣😂🤣.
I honestly would not of thought of Ali leading retribution cool choice WWE Actually did with him
ali for US Champ ASAP
This is unexpected. There is still hope for creative team.
😠REQUEST BACKUP I NEED BACKUP!!!😠
So police brutality
😡You Son Of A B**** Ali YOU'RE NEED TO HELP THE HURT BUSINESS GOD DAMN!!!😠
So Retribution Vs Hurt Business, Ricochet and Crews?
I'm in shock but it proves that the retribution was only small time faction.
Trash
Dio Madden looking like a damn terminator
Mustafa Ali can do a bad boy face lol
I used to support him but then but this isn't the Muatafa Ali i know😵😵😵😵😵😵 👇
So many heel turns are happening to the point where WWE is running out of babyfaces
Please don't google what slapjack means
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
WWWWWWWWHHHHAAAAAATTTTT
Yes!
I did not see that coming...
What!!...... WHAT!!!...... WHAAAAATT!?!?!?!?
🥰Mustafa is so beautiful and his long hair is just🥰🥰🥰🥰
Well, that........ Was unpredictable
😕No F***ing Way😕
😕What The Hell😕
AEW's dark order 2.0
Mustafa Ali: I would never been heel again. Also Mustafa Ali:
WWE haters are taking a huge L right now
☹What's Ali Out Of Ring☹
Apollo and ricochet watching this like 👁👄👁
Agree with me... but this is wwes attempt to recreate nexus from 10 years ago...  And This reminds me of when CM punk became the new leader of nexus
I'm suddenly much more invested in the retribution storyline haha. I hope they get to actually wrestle soon though! Looking forward to seeing them show off what they can do in the ring.
😕They Coming THEY COMING!!!😕
Shane thorn confirmed
Badass
😕Damn Retribution Lights Flashing😕
Not should be Ali..i think Lana and mojo be better
good
The best story for Ali on WWE
Kinda weird seeing two massive guys (Mace and T-Bar I suppose were those two? I'm not even sure who is who lol) following instructions of a way shorter guy like Ali, but we'll see where does this goes...
Reveal was early because no one gives a duck
They remind me of Bullet Club because of their attires and the background.
This was the debut retribution should have had after there initial “attacks” (but only then first couple and spread out with the main guys (mase tbar slap jack and the others (with better names like come on )) all leading to this
This was soooooooooooooooooooooo unexpected. Never thought Mustafa being the leader. If it was like Bray Wyatt or Seth Rollins, then yeah I would expected that😂
I like this storyline . . Will The Hurt Business will be babyface?
Ali taking up Retribution because the hacker was thrown away and forgotten
Restbushion now new power faction in Pro Wrestling Wwe.
Ali is natural face, thats weird. We saw retribution was NXT member before
This is a joke
Ali saved the mess of Retribution.
The shaky camera is so annoying
Im so proud of dio madden aka the great black otaku aka betterwoolie.
The Hurt Business are heel, thereby Mustafa Ali and Retribution are Face
Okay Mustafa Ali Takeout Leader The Hurt Business MVP
That means he was the hacker all along
Yeh we all knew that like 2 months ago
This is amazing!
wait are they actually gonna be able to be able to salvage this trainwreck of a debut for the faction?
Ngl i didnt saw that coming
Oh my Ali is revealed as their leader that’s probably the craziest thing ever to see now we would probably see him all geared up in their outfits and probably without the mask cause he’s now in control
There is motive, but I feel like Ali could have got over as a babyface
this is interesting but... did WWE took the bullet club storyline?
Imposter 😢😢😂😂
Mustafa Ali is bringing the semi Nexus back in the middle of pandemic
WOW never thought this was going to happen
Awesome Match/Segment Tonight,This Mustafa Ali Heel Was Legendary!!🙌🙌😎🐐🙏🙏
I hope this ties into him upset for not getting that title push
No s... for a long time.
Bruh Sheldon Benjamin’s arms are :22 👀
Wow. Never saw this coming at all. Ali is the bigger villain here
So basically Ali Is the retribution Hacker..
Yeah love u Mustafa 💋💋💋😘😘😘💞💏
Is it me, or the retribution design is like bullet clubs ?
Wait so slap Jack isn't the leader?
I'm torn on how I feel about Ali being the leader. y does retribution  copy some of the things the shield did in the very beginning. they come thru the audience. their mission is also similar to the shield also. with reigns being a super heel same with Rollins it would of made more sense if it was one of them leading it hence y they r doing similar things that the shield did. but love Ali incredible wrestler so if this is how hes gonna get a push, I'm fine with this
I wasn't expecting this but I wasn't expecting to expect anything thing so it doesn't count
What a waste of an angle if Mustafa Ali is the real leader.
Never expected Ali has that deep voice 1:21 😱
It was pretty obvious. The hacker icon is the same icon on his glove he wears in his entrance.
Tbh this felt like a dark order thing 🤔
We did not see this coming
Yeah put the Arabian guy as a leader of the Saboteurs nice job wwe 👏
Are they going to reveal the other 4 or they are just retribution minions?
Hi can you guys see my comment
This is a good start, but I still can't take people with names like T-Bar and Slapjack seriously.
I hope they make the connection that Ali was also the hacker and that he had to make Retribution to take it up a notch
Spoiler .....
Now i like ritributions
What a Shocker
I was hoping it was wade Barrett  Nexus 2.0
Hook line and Sinker... but isn’t this a contradictory of his stance to be a Muslim villain?  Don’t get me wrong, this was a great turn.
who would have thought that Mustafa is the leader.
The evolution betrays randy orton was awesome ❤❤
Who's slower than MVP?
Now that hacker storyline has finally come full circle
The name slapjack cracks me up every time.
OMG... Ali leads retribution..
That guy looks like bane in the batman movie
1:20 i liked this
me right now: Oh, very interesting. me next few month: Who is the retribution ??? Kind of food ???
UNEXPECTED!!!
But .... I wanna Tomasoo Ciampa
Called it
Really can’t wait for next week on how ali supposed to face ricochet & apollo..
1:12 mvps expression change saying WTF.
Mustafi Ali looks like a fusion between Siddiq and Dante from Walking Dead lol
Raw vs SmackDown vs nXt vs Retribution at Survivor Series
O_O
Question? How long before DC Comics calls ,Bane anyone.
Now watch some other fans from that place gonna say Ali stole the hand gesture from the knockoff Ministry with the leader who hides his bald spot with a manbun
Reading the comment section really kills my faith that WWE will ever get better. So many of you dipshits are not only complacent but actually enjoy this nonsense
why not cm punk? haha
Heel Business became Face Business.
I think the tall one with long hair is Dio Maddin and the bald one wearing the weird mask is Dominik Dijavkovic.
I knew this has gon happen.
They just recycled Muhammad Hassan
This is great y did we not do this when they first came
1:24 “ Oh my GAWD”!- Tom Phillips   Tom is channeling his inner Jim Ross a.k.a Good Ol J.R.😂😂💀
Ali has a hell was a great surprise.  But... I'm sorry. I can't take those names serious. Should've let them keep their old ones or gave them some better names.  Mace. T-bar. Okay, fine  Slapjack... No one is taking that guy serious...
I actually wanna see where this goes! I hope it’s not lame and they just attack small jobs, I’d love to see them get involved with EVERYONE like shield did!
Really Fresh dude
Who would the big half naked Guy be next to ali? I Think he looks like ryback
Retribution is such a joke. They make me want to stop watching
Meh. I’m glad they are using Mustafa But,  I feel this won’t last too long
So is RETRIBUTION a face faction, or did Mustafa Ali turn heel?   what if they’re considered tweeners now?
Cough gay Cough sry i got covid
Well that’s ruined that then
Ali is kind a sus
Good way togive ali A fast and efective  heal  turn.   Just wish they kept retribution  on both shows for a more fear induceing stable.
WWE should stop ruing Surprises by putting it in thumbnail
So Mustafa was the Hacker 🤣😎😎😎😎😎🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌😇😇😇😇😇😇🥰🥰🥰🥰
RICOCHET TURNING NEXT CONFIRMED
Now it's just Apollo Crews & Ricochet.
Vince keeps pushing suck.
Why TF does the cameraman keep shaking like an idiot?
Hol up when he get his first name back 🤔
It's all coming together now!....😒😕😄🙄 nice. Deja effing-vu!
It's Beautiful Yo
MVPs face was priceless
Am I the only one who saw this coming? A GENIUS performance by Ali
Hes to short for that role
Omfg Mustafa wow
That was so dope to witness I didn't see that coming but that was a perfect heel turn Mustafa pull! BRAVO PERFORMANCE👌
Okay them giving him a group to lead must mean they have faith in him so that’s a plus and if he can get some control of them with creative they might turn retribution around. Ali filming his promos the way he does with them in the back or even in it could be really cool
the three fight much better right gen
figured that he was the hacker at smackdown live and was the leader of retribution this whole time because of the all black outfits
summerslam was a month ago and bruh Mustafa revealed as the leader, Moon and Storm returning? UHM WOAH they really lived up to that tagline  everything has been unexpected ever since summerslam happened
wtf
There's only one Impostor and it's Mustafi Ali
Alguém brasileiro
Wwe is sadly joke
so is the Hurt Business face now?
1:10 He literally turned his heel
It’s makes perfect sense, it all started wit the mystery hacker on smackdown and how anytime they mention the hacker it show clips on videos gettin hacked and most of the logos match Ali’s then they dropped it now Retribution also deals wit hacking and now Ali is their leader so it makes sense
Mustafa Ali is the Smackdown Hacker!!! What is he doing with RETRIBUTION?
Would not see that coming
*الـعــرب يــجـمــعـو هـنـا👇😍* *ويـشـتـركـو فــي قـنـاتـي* 👍😉
That was a great reveal. Would have been better in front of live fans.
What are you serious 😲😲😲😲😲🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Ali😈😈😈😈😈🔥🔥🔥
Ali heel turn  awesome
So how soon does this storyline die and they are all relegated to jobbers...really hope that doesn’t happen cause once again wwe has a very interesting story in their court. Just don’t mess this one up this time please...also push Ali to the moon like seriously give the man the WWE championship. Strap a rocket to him and make this storyline go somewhere.
Fucken Sell Out
I didn't expect this at all at this moment but I like it at all. What a push for Mustafa.
Honestly I have no clue who's heel and who's face anymore in this storyline 😂
Hostile takeover, THEY HACE CONTRACTS
LET'S GO ALI!!
"The truth will be revealed"
I figured Mustafa Ali would turn heel at some point because unfortunately as a face he was just jobbing out much like Cedric Alexander before he turned heel.
and everyone was making memes on the hacker storyline not continuing, now Ali is the leader of Retribution and was the Hacker.
Just wanna tell you OC and Wyatt Family leader didnt tall as retributions too, and they're success
It really seems like Dio Madden is enjoying being...whatever Mace is 🤣🤣
This a big push for ali
Finally using this guy for something in wwe!! Such talents now getting pushes!! Good thing for mustafa!!
Nobody watching wrestling for more that a year would believe Mustafa Ali a whole Group of monsters. Nice try though.
So Ali is also the same mystery hacker from SmackDown few months back?! It’s coming into a full circle now!!
Just me or has Dijakovic bulked up a lot
That Was Unexpected
man who would've thought about this i think its the mizz
One of the best Raw epsiodes for a long time.
Just change the names and attire of the rest of them and WWE can actually save this!
Out of everybody back in the locker room mustafali this gotta be a joke 😂💀
this segment quite reminded me from Santos Escobar with The Escobar attacking Drake Maverick
WWE should a storyline where Mustafa Ali asks his friends Apollo Crews and Ricocchet to join Retribution. Apollo Crews and Ricocchet should refuse then they will try to stop Retribution from reaching their goals by attacking them. Then Ali will have no choice but to beat the hell out Apollo Crews and Ricocchet just like they did to The Hurt Business which cement Mustafa Ali to a fully functioning Heel.   Or second,  Apollo Crews and Ricocchet will join Retribution because they have a common goal to hurt the Hurt Business. But when they start understanding the twisted ideas and goals of Mustafa Ali they will try to defy them on reaching their goals thus making Mustafa Ali to beat the hell out of them which will also cement him as Fully Functioning Heel.
Now Ali, Cedric,Murphy are getting a push can't believe it 😍😍😍😍 finally 2020 has shown us something good
Why not CM PUNK !!!
2:29 anybody think the bald guy looks like ryback?
He could return with that LED mask like WRENCH from Watch Dogs 2 would be badass
So its not Roman as their leader
Oof
Although I don't think being the leader fits Ali 😂😂but I'm sooo glad for him n that finally wwe is doing him well💜
What a weird heel turn. LMAO
I really think this is confusing. I don't know who is the heel or face. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Where have I seen this story before............. oh thats right, TNA.
Oh Omg I was waiting for this moment like 😭🥺🤞🏼🙏💪🏼👑❤️✅
Hmm give it 2 weeks lol we'll see
Woah...dijak got bigger tho...
Grande ali
Awesome
Gayyyyyyyy
Two turns in 1 night  That's big
The heart of Light is now the Heart of Dark in Mustafa Ali with Retribution, the truth will truly be heard
Randy Orton's RKO n kick make thim live  wwe
YOU TRAITOR
Expectations: Roman reigns Reality: Mustafa Ali Man, I love this
Finally retribution is getting fixed... But i dont wanna get my high hope... Its WWE.
Ohh imagine there was a crown there would either be booing or cheering but ok I’m glad that happened becaus now the hacker thing is complete too kinda
This may be the thing that saves retribution...
This somehow fixed 2 narratives wtf. but I think it would be better if Ali was an ally/informant rather than the actual leader, T-Bar should just say the hes Dijakovic
Now this was unexpected. What the heck. Mind blown
Ali the leader really
🤮
That was crazy Biggest twist ever
Ali Was Supposed To Be The Mystery Hacker So This Is Somewhat Similar Speaking Of That Hacker Storyline There Was A Distorted Message Of A Woman Saying "Payback Is Coming And Is Coming Real Soon" Some Believed That Was Mickie James And She Hasn't Been Seen Since Her Loss To Zelina Vega So What About This She Is Revealed As The Other Leader Of The Women Of Revolution As Ali Is To The Men
Wow what
Ali heal or still  face
Roman's t-shirt that says "Wreck Everyone And Leave" made me think he was the leader. well played WWE very well played.
I new it I dang new it I was hooping Ali was gonna bring back the hacker then give them there old names back but still I’m happing anyway
retribution is unstoppble & monsters !!!! you got.. JASON VOORHEES, THE PREDATOR & BANE.. damn !!!!!
Mustafa Ali : is the leader of RETRIBUTION Dolph Ziggler : IT'S SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME
I cannot stop repeating this This is the best twist ever
Mustafa Ali  is fit for shampoo commercials
Lashley fighting Retribution like he did against The entire ECW + McMahon Authority
Ricochet and Apollo Crews should align themselves with Mustafa Ali and Retribution since they are friends with him.
*when you finally get imposter*  *someone sees you doing fake task instantly*  You: 1:15
I miss Dio maddin instead his current gimmick    "kono dio da"
2:00 Bobby struggling to fight that guy with his hair in the way 😂😂
Wait what’s his new name the hand lol 😂
hahha at the end john cena will burried this guys
Hurt business vs Retribution  in  Survivor series any takers.
To be clear: I’m watching for Mustafa, not Retribution
wwe has been completely trash
Can someone tell me where I'm earth Cedric has gone?
WE NEED MORE MEMBERS OF HURT BUSINESS LIKE CREWS AND RICCHOET
THIS SEGMENT SHOULD'VE ENDED THE SHOW
Finally Ali getting push..
Tozawa’s ninjas >>>>>>>>>>>>> retribushit
Finally someone who deserves a push is getting one
So where Alex been lately
Did not see this coming I hope they do something with this
Lame
So, so, so, do we still chase the light? 🥺
I wish this happened in front of a live crowd because I would be interest to see if they booed or cheered Ali I bet worse case it would be 50/50
Where's Cedric?
Aren’t there woman in Retribution?
i loved the way ali said "get em", def the sound of a leader.
Can they take their masks off now and the goofy face paint
No offense to Ali but this kinda killed my hype, I know thats an unpopular opinion but its mine honestly.
good for him, very good for him, hopefully this will lead to him being a mainstay on the roster and not on main event.
Now THIS I can get behind.
Still think they should have repackaged lars sullivan into some crazy chained aninal like thing.
Retribution rn is trash like bruh wwe had to ruin them
Look at there eyes😂😂😂 they suprised so much 😂😂😂
Wait.... What?  Talk about giving up on a storyline.  Why or how the F would MUSTAFA ALI be in charge of Retribution?
Finally a good Retribution angle. But I wonder what name are they gonna give him now? Fart?
Well since we're being honest here:.....it was me, Austin! Because I did it for The Rock, & Kevin Owens deserved that pie to the face...
DAMN! YES!
Rochoset Joins Retribution
Mustafa Ali reveald as the mystery hacker leader of Retribution
Mustafa ali  future wwe world champion
People will think Ali is just like the one that people think just like I am as ethnic imagination.
the former 205 Live members all get a heel turn, Cedric, Ali and Murphy
Smackdown hacker is finally revealed. . . on raw
*So Mustafa was the hacker all along... I hope that from this one he can get a good push because he deserve it.*
What a waste of a storyline!!! LOL
Parabéns Vince vc mostrou que é bom.
Bruh when Ali rolled out of the ring and Bobby Lasley said “give it to em” I was rolling🤣🤣🤣
So happy for him he finally got the push he deserves ✋
From 4 to 2 cruiserweight remain: Cedric Alexander has Join the hurt Business  Mustafa Ali is a Leader Retribution Only Apollo Crews and Ricochet
I want ali vs lashley for the u.s. title with Ali taking the title like if you agree
Ali lider de retribución? Jajaja no mamen
Finally! Something I can get behind and be interested in! Bout time Ali got the push he deserved!
I hope they don't give slapjack and Company the Nexus treatment
WTF! didn't expect this. Also, where Cedric Alexander?
I did not see that coming
This is better than the idea of him being the hacker
is mustafa ali gonna go all black attire now that's Pog
That's smug smirk when he turns was the best thing
Where is our cedric
WWE , has mysteriou leader of Retribution revealed. 7 months ago , AEW has mysterious leader of the Dark Order revealed.  Both have masked menbers in all black.  Dark Order  raises right hand up in gesture . Retribution does similar gesture.   Dark Order takes in under card talent who feel disrespected or forgotten.  Retribution does the same. WWE creative sure are taking a lot of ideas from AEW on this.
INTERESTING!
WHAT THE F
So now that Mustafa Ali is the leader of Retribution, will they get more members and how long will this last?
Hurt Business vs Retribution at Survivor Series. Book it! 👍👌
All I know is they ain't gonna mess with the commentary team with Joe on the team
If WWE ever goes to war with AEW, Retribution should fight The Dark Order
Finally, Retribution is here! Way To Go, Mustafa Ali! And just like that I have said from before, Retribution Today, Retribution Tomorrow and Retribution Forever!
What the hell why Ali was my favorite wearlser
So are Apollo and ricochet also like associated with retribution
Ali Ali Ali Ali Ali👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Stop Complaints Ali being the leader was a great move by wwe every Faction needs a good leader and a Top guy like Mustapha Ali is perfect
Who Wants to This At Survivor Series? RETRIBUTION VS THE HURT BUISSNESS?
Well we'll i didn't know Mostafa Ali is the leader of retribution
This was so dope... It all started with the hacking lol
FINALLY!! This is so great   Mustafa Ali getting Retribution ;)
Madden is bigger than I thought
SLAPJACK LMAO
1:20 wtf ali's voice is so deep
So what The Hurt Business gonna turn face and try to get Apollo Crews and Ricochet on there team and will see The Hurt Business Vs Retribution at Survivor Series?
Yesss wow 2020 is crazy ali getting his push roman is heel what the hell am i dreaming
We already know some of the members is Shane Thorne, Mia Yim, Mercedes Martinez, Dio Maddin, and Dominik Dijakovic.
Wtf is a slapjack ffs vince retire
Ok this is interesting!!!!!
Love it. Dont care what the indy fans think
1:13 execute order 66
Hope they don’t mess this up and they should also change the names and go back to their original names now that the leader was revealed.
Oof
😂 I can’t take these guys serious at all 🤣
I always knew something was going to happen. RETRIBUTION wouldn't do a stare down on anyone, because just from that and The Hurt Business was all smiles, the tables would be turned.
So what’s his stupid name gonna be?
Huge Push Best Heel This Year In My Opinion Him And Roman Regins
Retribution vs Hurt buissness for Survivor Series gonna be a banger
YESS I KNEW IT let's gooooo
I'm rubbing my nipples in excitement at the taught of Ali potential now...;)
Ali the leader of Retribution. LAME Another boring storyline.
O.M.G
he is the son of Ras AlGhul. That's why Bane helping him
Where is Cedric Alexander? Did I miss something ? 🤔
Well first prediction was he was the that truth Hacker now they decided to make him the leader of Retribution knew he would turn bad some day I mean he was off television for a while he’s finally getting the spotlight he deserves
What a good way to make the Hurt Business look more like a joke then they already were.
Biggest let down ever!!!! C M Punk. That’s who it should’ve been!!!!!
It's Time for the hurt business to be hurt
Idk if I’m correct but one of retribution members has the same type of tattoo as Shane Thorne
I think it's safe to stay that storylinewise the hacker was Ali and it was actually a group effort with Retribution. There were plenty of roumers saying it was Ali as well as plenty roumers saying it was a group of people so I guess this kills 2 birds with one stone.
The constant moving of the camera during the attack is what an earthquake feels like.
Yes! Ali!!!
Like johnny test would say: “whhhhooooaaa didn’t see that coming” 😂😂😂
Ali :The Leader vs The Monday Night Messah: Seth Rollins similar look , great athletes, book it Vince
mustafa ali the new seth rollins
Anyone want to be my Boyfriend 😍💋 💝💖♥️❤️
Ok this could be good as long as they don't repackage him with a goofy name like "A-Lie" 😂 please just let him be him just as a heel. No silly mask and bs names.
Wow perfect deception!!!!!!! Who knew Ali was the leader of Retribution? Not me that's for ONE!!!!!!!! Big Halloween trick people!!!!!!!!!
Madden having to much fun lol
I knew it all along
Many superstars are now heel turn
so, no CM Punk huh? so sad
Now this is the best thing goin for mustafa Ali💯💯
I literally flipped out of my seat. And I still cant believe it.
I Knew It All This Time Mustafa Ali Was The Leader Of Retribution
*HOLY F**K ON A F**K SANDWICH!!!*
I like Ali as leader of retribution.
Bruh
Just give them their real names back and it would sound much cooler Jesus Christ these stupid “slapjack” type stuff
Mind blown. Also I'm guess the guys on the looking like the boogeyman giving that vibe. Here the time 1:09 What you guys think comment below.
finally, it is complete
Ali good job.
Cedric:hurt business Ali:retribution
Musts Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 احنا نحبك ❤️
Thats so boring yh hes good but i just dont get hyped for him at all
Wow i would have never thought i'd be him
Can’t wait until raw next week
to be honest, this is a good story you know😂
MVP's face when Ali turns to hurt business 😂
but instead......... i already know that from the clip of video at smack down that he was the hacker all along because people like us were trying to figure out who was the hacker but you probably that you guys think that if it was cm punk? Well...... you were wrong about every single time that the person was Ali planned it everything that he wants to destroy the company and to kill the wwe.
We thought the hacker was gone  The hacker and RETRIBUTION are now an alliance  😱😱😱
Huh... unexpected heel turn from Ali, thats pretty dope, I hope he gets a push soon
Man the first reveal was treated poorly but now this is great
Well, this part of the storyline is getting interesting Finally an underdog is getting A PUSH
One of the best and interesting turns. Hacker storyline can be connected to this if done right. I've always liked Ali to be honest.
Antifa beats up black man who don’t believe what they believe.
Well this is unexpected, i'm glad wwe doing something to ali
The Hurt Business vs Retribution in War Game.
Fans : WWE sucks.. They don't know how to make storylines anymore  WWE :
A big pop in ali's career.
a hacker like ali would be able to control the lights. lol
Still corny
HE IS THE HACKAAA!!!!
Why mustafa did the dark order sign
Mustafa Ali next WWE World champion  for sure
Retubucion is weak and lost.
It all makes sense now would've been better if new day was still healthy cause really it should be them instead of the hurt business
Whaaaaaaat?!?!?! I'm not gonna lie I didn't see that coming at all  Mustafa Ali the leader of Retribution?!?! That's interesting
You know what.......good job WWE I didn't see it coming
Why does the bane wannabe remind me of ryback
What’s faster? The camera cuts or Minato?
Please Ali, do not get injured, We need you as the WWE Championship !!
Damn finally doing something with Ali.
Omg
WWE: THE END Also WWE: OK, so thank you, Ali, RETRIBUTION always good on those acting skills good job, yall.
Omg
Now this is epic
I honestly don't think I can take Mustafa Ali seriously as a threat or a leader of anything.
WWE's Brodie Lee is kinda small and the "dark Order" is wearing stupid masks 😂
So it finally makes sense!! The promos  from last spring when we saw The Hacker says the Truth will be revealed we knew it's Mustafa Ali all along and Retribution fits really well with the storyline it comes full circle now.Retribution vs Hurt Business looks to be awesome feud coming through Survivor Series
His a good one and he can be a heel. But of all the people.
Ali's retributions looks storonger than Tozawa’s ninjas
If only a crowd were there or they at least played a massive cheering/shocked sound. Would've made it MUCH better
Finally A great twist
Who thought that RETRIBUTION is a good idea?
No one saw it coming
Barrett: AM I A JOKE?
Seriously, i did not see this one coming. 😱 Does that mean Ali has turned heels now?  On the other side,im so happy to see him getting pushed by wwe. ❤️
That ending gave  me goosebumps
At least the commentator aren’t running away every time retribution shows up anymore
Well that's an anti climax
Join the Dark order
I hope they throw another twist in there where he's not the only leader. Maybe he's the vice president of Retribution.
Wow just wow pushing a loser who will die off after story
This is how you do this better: Hurt and Ali got all 4 angels covered; retribution charges in; Ali just walks past retribution as they charge in, leaving group’s left flank exposed.
Join the Dark Order
*SHOCKING MOMENT OF THE MONTH*
Really wish Seth really expanded on the disciples more after AOP & Austin Theory left. It would/should look something like this numbers wise
EVERY SAW THIS COMING LMAO
Ali sus vote him out
Wow. Just why though Ali??
Where was my brother Slapjack
So little Mustafa Ali is the leader of antifa??
i like this!! i am happy that a guy like Mustafa Ali will be the leader of retribution. this will give him a heel run smoothly and powerful :)
FINALLY! ALI'S GETTING A BUFF😂
This is great stuff hope we can see Ali elevate his game and be a monster heel.
MDT fan😁
Lost...for...words...right...now... 😐😱
Ali is the perfect leader for Retribution
This is epic. Lo mas epico de raw
My dawn toys would have love this if they did the stories line a little better
Finely wwe finely
Ummm... what?
🥰🥰🥰🌹🌹💪🏻💪🏻👍🏻👍🏻🤣😂😂🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬
Mustafa ali heel turn
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
I definitely did not see that coming
I just hope Mustafa Ali doesnt get a stupid name like the other members of retribution.
I guess the Hurt Business is Face now.
they should have swapped the 6-man tag match to this. this is a perfect end to the show tonight
ANOTHER STUPID DECISION
LOL! is this retribution for his stolen push by Kofi Kingston?
I fear that the names will ruin any momentum retribution has. I mean who would take SLAPJACK seriously? Great twist tho
good twist but honestly this won't get Ali a push given he was paired with the band of misfits with horrible names
Fantastic!
When they find out your weren't doing your task in electrical.
Slapjacks tattoos shown, anyone able to link?
So what's Ali's new Retribution name, do you think? Engine Block? Hubcap? Steering Wheel?
When Kofi kingston and the new day return Ali & Retribution need to absolutely obliterate them since Kofi got the WWE title push Ali was supposed to get but lost due to injury
This just stupid storyline.wwe is just garbage now. Stupid wwe
Out of everyone they pick Mustafa Ali like he cool and a great wrestler but he ain’t like face of wwe or even close  Ps sorry that I had to say this for no hate this is my opinion not a fact
Wow
Who else called this since "The Hacker" was shown? Also, Ali was sending cryptic tweets for the past few months!
¿WHY HE? It could have been another dude with more credibility even a girl
Wow the first thing Ina long time that I didn't see coming 😲😲😲
IM RIGHT THAT IS LUM!!
That's raw is always exciting to watch
I hope this brings back Mustafa Ali pursuit for the World Title.
Where's the hacker
MVP’s smile faded so fast though lol
Is it just me or has WWE gotten way better since the last time I watched it (Around the time seth was exposed as aop leader)
That was a big shocker never knew that ail would be the leader of retribution
This is great but where's cedric?
Oh, I like this, I really like this. Even better than triple h being the leader
Mvp face changed so fast
Kinda remind when in TNA tazz was the leader of Aces n 8
ok this was sick
This almost makes me want to subscribe
Hurt business went from: 😃😄😀 To :😐😳😲
I suddenly love Retribution
What the Hell?! Ali is the Leader of the Retribution??!!!
The action of wrestler Ali is not a good behavior that we Muslims do not do.
Of course a jobber is their leader
Absolutely Amazing reveal 🔥
Seriously what's with the shakey camera. I feel sick watching their brawl. Happy to see Ali though in the spotlight
This looks good
Hu-what a tweest!
Vince Vince Vince, what the hell kind of slop is this?
MOST PEOPLE WILL TURN HEEL MAYBE IN WWE
*explode in my head* *just no way of words but just silence*😮🤯😱
There’s one imposter among us.....
The Guy with The Dreads, looks like a freak Predator.. With his mask
Just imagine if braun was running this just sit there and think about it
*in M. Night Shamylan voice* What a twist!
wooooow
Im so glad they are using ali i hope they stick with him i use to see him at Indy shows and was always a nice guy talking to everyone
Ali needs to be wwe champion!
The hacker storyline to be continued with RETRIBUTION
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand I'm interested again!
GET EM!!!!!!
BEST twist since, the sixth sense...🥺😱
Lmao a joke
I'm not surprised
Finally some love for Ali!
my god these camera cuts are terrible
1.15min , MVP expression when they know they screwed haha
THIS WAS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED. BUT THAT WAS SO GOOD. ALI IS FINALLY GETTING A CHANCE.
Sorry Retribution is not good..🤦🏻‍♂️
Looking like bootleg rejects of The Dark Order....
*heel stable vs heel stable*
Is that BANE & PREDATOR??? I'm confused
God bless remember God love u
so who are the heels and who are the faces?
Retribution just got 10x worse than it already was
Hard to watch anything during the brawl...got motion sickness lol
Literally seen this coming. But I'm glad wwe is finally I'd Ng Ali
and WWE still hasn't changed Slapjack's name.   Guess they haven't looked up on Urban Dictionary to see if it has any other meaning. :)
RAW
So...he's the leader of retribution. What about the hacker guy? Is he the hacker?
So have the girls been dropped from this Retribution storyline?
So retribution is a mid card threat. This was the build of it?
Still don't care about Retribution. How do you create a group less intimidating than the Dork Order?
This is actually more exciting, I can't wait to see what ali does as the leader.
Good job WWE & Vince, you finally made a good storyline, absolutely amazing.👏🏻
The reason Ali is with Retribution is because last year when he got hurt, Kofi took his spot and ended up winning the title at Wrestlemania.  He's upset about that.  Expect this to be Ali's explanation next week. :P
For retribution to be a good good serious faction, they need a couple big name BIG MEN WRESTLERS added, maybe, Corbin, KO , Ziggler, Strowman, or even a Roman and the Usos, or A.O.P. ,   so far the Nexus was a better look than this tho but this is still entertaining to see where it can go
Lmao such a weak ripoff of The dark order. Instead of curling fingers they just put a hand out too. All fear mace and tbone and slapnuts
Yes I hope really this is the push for Ali becaus he deserves it
0:33 Mustafa sold that hit like a boss
Ooooooooo YESSSSSSS!!!
Awesome never saw it coming
So he is the Hacker
The WWE's answer the Dork Order
While I was hoping Aleister Black was the ultimate leader, I'm excited to see its Mustafa Ali
Ali wants retribution for losing that title opportunity to an injury. Kofi took his spot light and that was great for kofi now Ali wants to rise to the top again and what better than having all that support. All ali has to do is give us his reasons and must be real and making sense
Saw some amazing UFC fights two weeks in a row and now wrestling bores me again 😕
Who cares about Ali anyways? lol
He had a face and heel turn both in 1 night! AMAZING!!!
Nobody: vince let’s turn every body heel   WWE fans : that’s not how you play the game
Why Mustafa? Why him?! Of all people Mustafa Ali?
I wouldn’t say a good push yet for either Ali or Retribution. Finally a good place for Ali to be in?  Yes, but until after Survivor Series.  I’ll wait  to see if Mr. McMahon really makes them a threat, and continues pushing Retribution and Ali as there leader.  To the top.
What a shocker! 😱
Oh my god the leader of crowbar and slappy nuts is Ali? What? Craziness lmao.
Well this was unexpected I expected to be Rollins
Really had us fooled thinking Roman was the leader
OK RETRIBUTION! You have my attention now.
This is actually one of the best heel turns I’ve seen imo
Got a massive hard on when i saw this
Wow ...wwe finally pushing Mustafa Ali... I thought this day would never come
I love how the faces of MVP Benjamin Lashley just Dropped
We are retribution I want to be in retribution
I could see Ali as a member but leader is a bit far fetched
that pleb😡
Suddenly a huge fan of Ali
Mustafa Ali: The Truth will be heard?  Mustafa Ali was the whole time his plan betrayed the Wwe Universe.
yea who else saw this coming?
I hope Ali brings Retribution in his side.
YES!!! BRAVO!!! THANK YOU!!! YOU FINALLY DID SOMETHING WORTH WATCHING!!!
This just went from uninteresting to...  Even more uninteresting.
Business is good
To Be Continued.............
UNDERWEALM & UNDERRRATED NO MORE
LMFAO I just want to know why him
Yes yes yes yes yes
Okay okay okay. I'll admit, when someone in WWE Creative finally did something, reasonably good. I did NOT anticipate a Mustafa Ali feel turn. He always seemed like the Perennial Babyface.   Now here's the hard question. Does Mustafa Ali have the personality; to maintain the heel turn, and keep the momentum going??? If he does; then not only does he deserve to be in a main event spot. But he also deserves an academy Award, for keeping RETRIBUTION in the spotlight. Lord knows; very little else would have saved their story-line.
This should win OMG moment of the year but I’d still choose Retribution over THB any day of the week
YES YES ALI 💯🙌 THE HACKER!
I actually really LIKE that im so happy wwe surprised me 💯‼️
I knew it ail wow not surprise
Mustafa ali💛
ricochet and apollo be like 👁👄👁
HE SAID GIVE IT TO EM  HE GAVE IT   ALI 💯
Hurt business is in pain
This moment SINGLE-HANDEDLY saved this Retribution non-sense from being a complete bust. Now, it becomes infinitely more interesting.
And dat mean The Hurt Business gonna turn face with Ricochet and Apollo Crew???
Hell yeah! I love retribution even more now lol, hopefully Ali gets a good run and a shot at the title in the future
Still can't get over slapjack
Weak
therre face at 1:14 loll
wtf why not cm punk
😒😒😒😒 Really. Ali is the main guy in charge
0:39-3:04 when you're getting bullied by the jocks but the cosplayer kids come to your rescue
Well played wwe,I love it
Im not sure which one the hell was
So the Hurt Business is now a Face stable???
I TOLD Y’ALL   ALI’S RETRIBUTION 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈💯
11 years old me wasn't prepare for this...
i wonder how ricochet and Crews are reacting to this betrayal though... this will get reallyyyyy interesting
So was this a double turn or what
When your best friend betrays you.
Al fin le dan un push a Ali!!
Why didn’t they end the show with this
Ngl this suddenly got waaay more interesting.
If Mustafa is the leader of this  then who is the Smackdown hacker
Heels attacking Heels now the hurt business will get more members retribution still needs 1 more guy to have 5 they only have 4 right now
Makes Perfect Sense but man still didnt see it coming
Mace looking like a Predator Halloween costume. Lol!
Considering how wwe booking decisions where when it came to Ali it makes perfect damn sense to have him as the leader of retribution ohhhh man survivor series is going to be good.
He to little
So he's heel now . Wow there are a lot of heels turns in 2020
This is the bullet club but boring
Dio madden looks freaking awesome
I won't be surprised if MVP pitched the idea of having Ali as the potential leader of RETRIBUTION. After all, he's been saving careers for the past few months.
This turn made zero sense
I have told YOU! THE TRUTH WILL BE REVEALED!!!
RETRIBUTION  Mustafa Ali - leader Dio Maddin - Mace Dominik Dijakovic - T Bar Shane Thorne - Slapjack Mia Yim - Reckoning  Former member: Mercedes Martinez - Retaliation
"Get him!" 🤯
I THINK THATS DOMINK FROM NXT
Look like Ali his not chasing the light anymore he is chasing the dark
WTF !!!
I was like 👀  Then 👌 to wwe
This whole thing was trash until you see their faces at 1:15
Hopefully next week Mustafa Ali will reveal himself as the "SmackDown Mystery Hacker."
This is unbelievably awesome, Mustafa Ali will become one of the best heels ever!!
This whole thing was trash until you see their faces at 1:14
It's just the dark order booking lol I hope Ali does his best
Can we get rid of the “backyard wrestling” VHC style shaky camera guys, they’re trying too hard to add aesthetics to the action, but in reality it’s just damn annoying..
I didn't see that coming omg
Ali needed a heel turn
Anyone else think he could use a new finisher with this turn?
Yaaaaaas, so well deserved for Ali!
That "gettem" Ali said 💀 He should just dress up as the shredder next time
Woe I didn't see that coming!!!
I’m getting some real Aces and Eights vibe from Retribution...minus the motorcycles of course.
I am so glad Ali got this spot. It's perfect. Now we all know Ali can put on fire promos on his twitter, I hope they allow him to talk on his own. I can get serious CM Punk vibes from Ali if they allow him to go on his own on the mic.
Join the dark order 😂
Their chance to give Ali a title shot while it’s here
Not CM Punk??
Heel Mustafa Ali future WWE Champion or US Champion.
That was a twist definitely not expected
1:05 : You and your friends making Bullyng the shy man of the class 1:14 : When they see that instead of taking out their MP3, he pulls out his MP5
Wonder if Shorty G will turn out to be the other leader?
Plot twist!!!
Which one is Flapjack?
Thats the real monday night messiah....
So they brought in the most badass heel faction in recent memory (Hurt Business) and now they're jobbing them to Mustafa Ali (dead content) and a budget Nexus group. Smfh they just have to overbook everything don't they.
What a heel turn
I would have bet money the miz was the leader.
Wrestlamia and us all predicted this 🤙🤘
Tbh I didnt want to see these guys again but now that Ali is the leader I'm interested to see where this goes
I wish EC3 was still in WWE and apart of this group along with many others Retribution is great!
well thank you for that Unsatisfying ending
Seems pretty legit
Ali should been the messiah just like the Netflix show
The Hacker ls back
It the Budget s&m version of dark order lolll😂🤣
I hope they don’t screw up
Why didn't I noticed that sooner, Ali always wears the same mask design as retribution
Tiempo de volar !!!!!
No one: Not even WWE: Bots:don't lie who has been watching WWE for over a year now
With this situation. It's confirm the hurt business turn face as well. Glad to see that. Unpredictable
Damn. I was predicting either Samoa Joe or Shane McMahon. Ali wasn't even a thought when thinking about who could be the leader. I'm interested to see where this goes. Also, imagine if this was in front of a live crowd and the reaction this would get.
I'm surprised that the ''Mystery Hacker and RETRIBUTION'' storylines were related to each other and Mustafa Ali just proves to us that he's the Mystery Hacker and he's the real leader of RETRIBUTION
WOW THIS IS INSANE
Not surprised him being the Leader
Retribution(Ali, T-Bar, Slapjack and  Mace) vs. The Hurt Business(MVP, Lashley, Alexander and Benjamin) at Survivor Series 2020 in a 4-on-4 elimination match
Booring....Booring!
I KNEW IT!!!! All of that computer hacker stuff, it was rumored to be Ali. Those segments were for Retribution. I CALLED IT!!!
Ali is the leader of retribution
Okay retribution, you've got my attention
This was a great twist tho
What’s so weird is retribution has been compared to Antifa and Ali use to be a police officer which is the enemy of the Antifa
Finally, Mustafa Ali with a dark side
Oh so that's why they have that kind of stupid masks like Ali mask (except slapjack)
I knew that it was a b superstar who is Mad
5”2 lol short man get him lol 😂
Haha soo pretty much DARK ORDER WWE. Weak leader and even weaker squad.
Putting Ali with Retribution is paramount to a death sentence for his career
Never trust a hacker.
Dammnnnn....he said he hate being a heel....
Ali turned heel. My heart is broken. Ali you were the light.    *noooooo*
Excuse me.... WHAT??! OMG! i wasn´t expeting that O.o incredible Twist! I thought retribution was buried but after that epic reveal it might really has a chance!
Finally ali is main event material
Is it just me or is Mace cool af
Is hurt business aface now
Shane Thorne is also one of the members of retribution
Aces n eights beginning storyline was better than retribution
Lol Ali? seriously? he is gotta be the least intimidating out of the entire roster 🤦‍♂️😂
WWE: Mustafa Ali is revealed as RETRIBUTION's leader  Me: Oh Yeah, This kind of surprised that we actually need from WWE
I knew he was the leader of Retribution.
He has the potential to be a great heel and yet he didn’t even say a word.
Rico and apollow join hurt bn
I f with predator over there
Retribution leader is Ali and also he is hacker wow that make sense now
I freaking love this. This Retribution storyline is finally going places. I love it.
I thought it was CM punk
Boom what? Why wwe why wwe why u turning him to heel
So both teams are heel? Retribution and The Hurt Business??
They all dress like they are going to a rock concert or something😒😒😒
That one guy with the predator mask loos soo stupid
Mustafa Ali...What the Hell?!
Now Ali can finally stop crying on Twitter
Apollo Crews & Ricochet join the hurt business and sets up for Retribution Vs The Hurt Business at Survivor Series
wwe Mustafa ali and Retribution it's copy njpw prince devitt and bullet club debut
Dream Match Nexus vs Retribution
Haha the names are still so stupid. Mace T Bar and SlapJack.
is this a double turn? then Cedric Alexander went  face-heel-face in just a couple months.. gg
Good twist but not sure why they decided to give retribution like 6 members gonna be hard to invest in each character individually should have stuck to 4 and ali being the leader
Dumb sorry
OMG!
eh looking forward to smackdown tho
I don't Believe it! Mustafa Ali!? Leader of retribution!😧
It is just me or one of them with Predator cosplay look Badass.
if ali changes his name wwe you went from good to bad to good back to bad
Love it
So this means The Hurt Business and Retribution will be in a Mega Feud?
I bet you the Hurt business didn't see that coming
Woah! Did not expect that!!!
*CM Punk left the chat*
Can't watch it, the camera is awful.....
Where the hell is Cedric? Wasn't he with the hurt business?
Retribution is the WWE version of the "Dark Order" of AEW
Does this mean ricochet and cedric will join the hurt business?
What now
Ali should have won the Mitb ladder match 2019, now he gets his biggest push
ali be looking hAwT tho (also he could play aladdin)
lololol this 4 foot jobber being the leader.. WWE kiddy land never stop giving laughs at least.
A Leader mustafa
Mustafa Ali heel!
It's incredible that MVP with his return he has Push a lot of wasted talent first Bobby,then Shelton and Now Mustafa has return with a pretty good decisión,all of This thanks to MVP return,nothing but respect for this man.
What’s up with the masks tho lol
Huh
Finally Ali with a big push
So he joined the Dark Order? Interesting... 🤔
why in 2:38 have a random kid doin gang signs
yknow, now that i think about it, Ali being the leader actually makes sense
For Mustafa Ali being the hacker made sense to create Retribution to take over both Raw and SmackDown now he's the leader of them I didn't see that coming Bravo Bravo
The old hacker angle show a circle similar to what Ali used to have.
Ali became the hacker because WWE didn't care about him so he decided to reveal secrets about the Superstars. The voices viewers deciphered were red herrings. He gave up being the hacker when the long term plan wouldn't work out so he decided to come up with a back-up plan:a group of NXT Superstars who were being mistreated by WWE called Retribution. In time all was revealed and now Ali will rise.
I expected this to happen I really did I guess this is to make up the fact that Ali was supposed to beat Daniel Bryant and not kofi but now I have the BIGGEST feeling that he’s the hacker also but will see Friday
Everybody hates what they’ve done to Dijak, but tbh, while I do hate the new name, I’m hopeful about the makeover. He’s awesome in ring and on mic, but he never had a good gimmick that you could use to make merch, which is crucial to main event success. Hopefully he’ll smoothly transition from Retribution gimmick into solo main event worthy character. Same with Thorne. The guy never found his footing as solo star. And that “Worst” gimmick was just terrible.
Ummm.......................im surprised how Mr. McMahon make the script cause it dont even make any sense. The bad guy is The Hurt Business and the good guy is Mustafa Ali, Richochet and Apollo Crews, but then Ali just being the bad guy??  I think they should make a better script so people would understand the storyline. But, WWE is still the best show. (Im from Indonesia BTW)
What a tweest
This show is getting hard to watch
I know they’re not the same thing, and I’m gonna get flack for the comparison, but the Dark Order wasn’t exactly good prior to Brodie Lee’s appearance. Following that, the Dark Order did seem to gain popularity on Social Media and they were even booked better. Maybe we can see the same thing with RETRIBUTION.
I love WWE is awesome nice
Well this was good. Could have been great if: 1. It happened at a network PPV. 2. It happened sooner.
So is the hurt business becoming good guys slowly over time or will we have 2 large heel factions running amok
Year of the heel turns
he was a hacker and now a leader
Dang that’s a good idea I wonder how ricochet and Apollo’s feel
What if they were the wwe hackers
Remember when retribution were antifa kids wrecking sets.  I will reserve judgement on this reveal but the words making it up as you go along spring to mind.
Mustafa Ali turns heel and leading a faction.
So, who are the heels?
Retribution is lame
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The predator is coming.
So ali come up with the name slapjack
How long is this going to last?
One dress like bane anotjer dress like baaghul from sinister
Ali was in charge of all the lights ali was the reason of all of the lights going off he was the hacker and the hacker hacked the lights off
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!
I don't like RETRIBUTION but I like Ali being the leader, this was his payback because he didn't get his title shot  It was obvious who the hacker was but WWE switch stuff quick.  Ali needed this .
1:11 love the expression from Ali as well as MVP here.
1:14 that was gold
Decent swerve, need to give Ali a better mask budget for his new friends though
THAT'S WHO IT  WAS THE WHOLE TIME WOW 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯     WTF
I knew him was with this group all this time.I like hurt business.Their faces turn.🤣🤣🤣👍👍🤘🤘
Jim Ross FINALLLY FINALLY MY GOD FINALLY.
Is Ali's contract up? Is that the reason WWE pushes him?
diablos eso no lo vi venir 👍
It makes sense if you think of that Hackerman storyline
Ali reminds me of X-Pac
I think Dio and Dijakovic are one of the members.
That was hype! Let's go Brenan!
Heel Superstars U thought Leader of RETRIBUTION 1. Rollins 2. Reigns 3. Orton  Not all Bad Guys were Leader in Wrecking Group but a guy who was pretending a good guy was the LEADER and thee Bad Guy
Oh this is fantastic! Long term booking for that hacker story. Nice!
So Bane, The Predator and Casey Jones from the ninja turtles are in the WWE? Chucky and Robocop worked so well in WCW. This can’t fail 🙄🙄🙄
😱😱😱
This was very well done
If the hacker storyline is still canon..Then this will be interesting!
I guess it was true ali is the masked guy hacker
I mean, he has all the reasons to look for retribution. I kinda thought it would rely on a manager to be the leader.
Now whos the other members of retribution plus ali does not need a push he is a cruiserweight and had a better chance at the united states title when he was on smackdown but now that the titles haved changed ali is probably better of going for a title shot not some leadish maniac dangerous pyscho group
this is pathetic.
NANI?
shades of bullet club nd nwo no lie
THIS ENTIRE TIME?!!
So he is the leader he was the mystery hacker back then now he is the leader of Retribution it all make sense anyways this is awesome💯
Never expected this for even a second.😲😲😲😲
You know what, this makes absolute sense! Ali wears a mask too.
Me hurt of business respect
Stupid they should of put someone alot better than Ali  in charge
Now that the hacker (leader of "Retribution") is identified, I see Apollo and Ricochet teaming up with the Hurt Business
Por fin la WWE sorprende... Ojalá Ali sea un buen heel.
Where was Cedric
What the hell just happened
He will be a great Heel maybe the best Heel of this Generation.
No. Tell me I'm not covering my eyes in bleach after what I've just seen!
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
Vince is punking everybody with Ali being the leader.
مب سهل ابو بكس
finally, an unexpected heel  turn,WWE also did a good job by not giving out any rumours. Now i think this retribution thing is getting interesting.Hope wwe will turn this into a nice storyline
Now all he needs is that us title from Bobby lashley, or if Retribution get drafted to smackdown he can get the ic title please it’s Ali’s time
Is anybody gonna comment about ali's voice when he said "GET THEM!"?
*WE BEEN WANTING THIS FOR A WHILE NOW*  FINALLY
Heel Ali finally ?
MACE’s look is so coool
It all makes sense know how retribution was able to jump from raw to smackdowm was he was the smackdown hacker and he is part of raw
Ild like to give Liv Morgan a Slapjack
The hurt business will be thrown out of wwe by retribution 👏👏
I still hope this fails ngl. Hate this storyline.
Massive YAWN
Best thing they’ve done with this storyline. Could be tied in to the hacker thing. Please just stop calling that man Slapjack
Take your masks off for Christ sake
Make sense if they incorporate the hacker storyline with retribution.
Is Ali still face tho ???
I Knew It He Was The Leader All Along Became He Didn't Showup For 2 Weeks After His Return
He gets his full name back AND is the main guy is a major storyline, props
Funny how no one is talking trash about Retribution no more LMAO Steal the show Ali!
What a Plot Twist! I definitely wasn’t expecting this
So Ali was the hacker all along huh"
Can’t forgive the names that got stuck on Dijakovic, Maddin, and Thorne, but I can Damn sure say...this did redeem Retribution in my eyes.
So here we go 2 factions going at it, this can be awesome but also get ruined by vince so quick tbh
The Hacker is finally revealed!!
What a joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now that Retribution is living up to the hype.a few changes need to be made 1) new names for the members except Mace that name is pretty decent 2) new masks for some of the members except Mace and the guy who’s known as T-Bar (T-bar’s name needs to definitely be changed) 3) Mustafa Ali needs the same outside as the rest of them and a completely different looking mask than the rest of them in my opinion a mask like scorpion from mortal combat would look great on him
Huge Ali fan so i have to be glad he's finally doing something and getting some spotlight however I'm not totally sold on this being the best thing for him but I will try to be optimistic.
1:15 Shelton was like "WTF?" Side note Dio Madden I mean Mace legit looks insane.
Just when I thought this couldn't get any worse
This has straight edge society vibes. I like it
I love how Mase has made his attire a little different to bring his character out more. I suggest T bar and Slapjack to do the same
Am I the only one who noticed that his voice sounded deeper when he said get them so not only did he turn heel and become the leader of retribution but he hit puberty
I mean I like that they showed one identity but why corrupt Ali's character with this storyline
So is Apollo Crews and Richocet with Retribution too?
So, what's creative going to change Mustafa's name to? Cooter Scoot, Ball Gag, there's only so many quality names left after Slapjack.
DID NOT SEE THAT COMING WTF
Bruh 1:53 Bobby Lashley hurt that steel steps more than it hurt him! 💀
Ali returns with a mask a few months later, but I never thought this was gonna happen unexpectedly.
Guess Ricochet and Apollo didn't know he was the imposter 😂
This is some RAW AT WAR style twist. Well done WWE.
I'm still predicting more people are going to be revealed as retribution members  Mojo Rawley Chad Gable Titus O'Neil Bo Dallas Vanessa Borne Jinder Mahal Akira Tozawa Tony Nese Humberto Carrillo Brenden Vink Sonya Deville
Mustafa Ali from original planned mystery hacker to the leader of RETRIBUTION
Ali as leader is a bit random
Ali is just too small and unbelievable
THAT is good
The hacker of Smackdown: Ali The leader of The Retribution: Ali Ali owns both Raw and Smackdown
I see. Oh man. Like nexus leader wade barrett 10 years ago invades raw. That is why all the promos is know the truth.
I'm hyped for this but let's see where this is going.
I knew it would be someone no one expected
I love it
The first actually continuity in wwe
Mutasfa Ali Is The Leader Of The RETRIBUTION Shocking
The New Dark Knight Rises Movie looks great Lol
No wonder the Hacker And Retribution are somewhat connected, and what a great push for Mustafa Ali!
Better not call him hackman
The hacker is the leader? Well done!
I heard a rumour but it makes sense only a wwe raw superstars had to be working with them because if no saw them when show stars that means they already in the building because of a wwe superstars
1:42 slapjack 🤣🤣🤣 still can't get over it
Omg perfect 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Remember when dijakovic was putting on great matches with Keith lee, those were good times
ali
Finally
Good surprise, I have to admit now this got my attention
It was ali
Retribution has the names like t-bar and slapjack  Now they're leader is a little boy  It's impossible to take this group seriously now more than ever
*biggest shock of the night, but it seems to be good for business for them*
I hope retribution will be wwe version of bullet club
Boring! I hope hurt business buries retribution at survivor series
I didn't know Ali is the leader of retribution
Dijakovic i mean T-Bane carrying them
OMG ALI HE'S IN RETRIBUTION!😱
Thank you WWE
Buddy’s Face turn and Mustafas heel turn are two of the best in recent memory
I kinda have a feeling that in the near future we will see Mustafa Ali get a WWE Championship run. Now that would be epic. 🔥
Turning heel without even lifting a finger at your opponent. Brilliant
wait how do you guys know he is hacker guy
I suddenly care about Retribution if it means Mustafa Ali is getting pushed.
I mean a fan favorite making a sudden heel turn is not surprising.
lol
Called it! Props to WWE. That was an excellent double turn.
Before y’all “fans” start hating like you always do give this a chance because it always happens YALL say this is gonna be a bad idea then it turns out to be something amazing then you “fans” are like “yeah we knew this was gonna be great the entire time haha lol” smh
Bruhh no ali was supposed to be the hacker on smackdown dijakovic and dio are HUGE they would never follow ali
Just because it's unexpected, doesn't mean it's good, I however don't know what to think about this
Thats why they called it Retribution
I Knew It!
All this time we thought is was cm punk
Should have seen this coming. Long ago the hacker that they show on SD for weeks wearing the black hoodie, shown that blue light ring on the screen, ppl guessing it was Ali becuz he wears his blue lite up mask. Wwe stop showing the hacker, I kept wondering what ever happen to it. All sudden this retribution comes out also wearing the black hoodie. All makes sense now, the hacker was Ali, the leader of retribution. It was all connected. I'll be damn.
Join the dark order.
Ali's voice was way different
Mustafa Ali deserves this spotlight. Good job WWE.
It was alright but I wanted cm pick as the leader
El hacker de antes era mustafa ali, dijeron que era un personaje para él pero luego apareció esto cosa que está bien
Now that Retribution has 4 members, they can properly feud with the Hurt Business. I wonder what they'll do with Ricochet and Apollo though. I hope they temporarily align themselves with the Hurt Business while Retribution adds 2 more members to the group so we can have a big stable v. stable feud.
Finally Ali is getting a push, finally he suffered a lot when he got injured before elimination chamber and when the hacker was scrapped
Yep everyone knew that all along 😒
Ohhh yesss! That's what I'm talking about! I love this new Ali and Retribution faction! They made their statements loud and clear week after week!
The Former Cop is leading Anarchists.  2020 is wild folks.
I was in shock when Ali was reaveled as the leader. Mind blowing right there.
this angle SUCKED until literally this twist. credit where credit is due
This is fantastic.
Slapjack.... I will never get used to this
Mustafa Ali got his cover blown and get his revenge on MVP for his army. 1:00. His army. 😱.
😳 wow
I know one thing. This is not at all going to be good for him even though it's seem like it. Bcz he don't have that leadership skill like MVP,Seth Rollins,Roman reigns ,cm punk, AJ and Randy
HELL YEAH, Alì is the leader of Retribution, I was waiting for this moment but it would have been perfect if they had given him the hacker's character where he would have introduced the Retribution unmasking himself and then revealing himself as the leader, Alì were the Smackdown hacker from the beginning and planned all this from months, there's always been him behind Retribution and their vandalists acts, the plan worked, the hacker's storyline comes full circle
far ali reveals hes leading the group whats next cm punk in the group as well
Why ail why
Yes yes yes 🙌
i did not see that coming
Bruh its not even believable
Oh my god
Well, this just got interesting. Just dont mess it up like you did nexus
Glad hurt business are good guys who would thought
Kofi should be Ali's first victim
Damn what ever happened to the commentary team being so afraid of Retribution that they’d run upon their arrival? It was a small detail but I thought it really added to their presence, especially with the lack of commentary during their segments.
Now THIS is a plot twist.
I must say, I'm loving these new face, new heels and these twist and turns before the draft.
The best heel turn in gods history
I knew it was gonna happen
WTF
Now I hate to bad mouth any product......but......that's gonna go over like a fart in church.
I didn't see that coming 😮
I’m so happy they gave it to a mid carder like ahli this can be huge for him
Well, tbh, that is, if not, is the best out of nowhere heel turn of the decade.
Where is cedric alexander?
I thought triple h was the leader because they are from NXT it would make more sense
Dio Madden is looking kinda Predatorish here
We were rooting for you we were all rooting for u
Truth should be heard??
They need to add a fifth member to the hurt business.
What makes this great is that you know that entire stable is filled with hungry performers. They’re gonna give it their all.
I definitely wasn't expecting that.   Wow.  Insane.   Mustafa Ali the leader of Retribution.
What If Ali was the hacker and this is all connected back to those origins of the smackdown hacker
Mustafa is gonna win the US title from Bobby. I'm calling it.
The WWE project zorgo
This is what retribution needed to make them actually seem cool and Ali was the perfect choice for it
Finally, a good twist in forever...
Remember how everyone clowned on retribution? Yeah you don’t get to jump back on the wagon
And everybody thought that he was the smack down hacker, but this whole time he’s been the leader of retribution this entire week
Now this faction can be as big as The Bullet Club if booked right.
sooooo ali was the mystery hacker? lol
Wait a second?!WHAT?!?
Very good  twist
And now everyone is gonna be on retribution’s side, just cause mustafa Ali joined them,lol.
HAHAHAHAHA THIS LIL GUY IS THE LEADER HAHAHA WHAT A JOKE
I could care less about retributions names. THEY'RE A BADASS FACTION
Wwe still using the SummerSlam tagline cuz I didn't c this move coming at all 👍🏿
Pfft!
The Dark order of the wwe
Now I understand why he's been so aggressive during his matches on Main Event recently.
I can't believe that Mustafa Ali is the Leader of Retribution i thought it was Roman Reigns.
We knew it...
How  face  VIP  change  1:22
I was curious about retribution before. ali being revealed as retribution’s leader has me even more curious.
THIS FUCCIN AWESOME 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 RETRIBUTION IS 🔥 LETTTTTTTTTTTTTTS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I KNEW THIS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE THE HACKER STORYLINE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😱😱😱😱😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🔥🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🔥😱😱😱😱👀👀🔥🔥🔥
Finally big push on Ali
Can't you believe mustafa ali is really the retribution leader and mastermind
WWWHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATT?!?!  😱😱😱
Lol Bobby Lashley would kill that group!
I never knew 😱
I like this. This is a good surprise and wwe can retake all about the hacker with Ali
I Thought It's CM Punk Is Da Leader Of The Retribution
And now I am invested into Retribution once again
Mustafa Ali FINALLY gettng the respect he deserves
*WWE MANDOU BEM DEMAAAAAIS* 🇧🇷
I didn’t expect Ali to be the leader
I cant belive it
I'm so confused. Who is the heel and face here? 😅
First Cedric joined The Hurt Business and now second Ali is with Retribution.
Wwe just thank u for this booking that's good idea
I already knew Ali was the leader
Between him and Roman aligning with Heyman.. never let it be said the WWE is predictable
Mabey retribution has a place in wwe after all
Maybe the ‘hacker’ segments were the whole beginning of Retribution but to not make it look obvious they left it a little bit then had this and now it’s full circle
This is the most unexpected heel turn I have seen. Making ali the RETRIBUTION leader was such a good choice. Because nobody was expecting him to be the leader. Great Twist!
Wow. Mustafa Ali join RETRIBUTION
Ali, Crews, Ricochet as a friendship:                                      *Exists*  "There's an impostor Among Us*
He was sus so
Ali is one of the nicest people they have in the roster.  So it's great to see him turn to the dark side and show what he can do.
1:21 that deep voice ali did.though
One word: Damn! Ali made it perfect with that heel turn! I love it!
I cant believe ali part of retribution
Wtf?
if u belive in god sub to me please if i get 400 subs in 2 days i will do a giveaway
Does this mean that the hacker was behind the rising of retribution?
I knew it
Por essa ninguém tava esperando, Mustafa surpreendeu pra carai 🔥🇧🇷
This was as unexpected as me getting 100% in my Math Class. Did not expected to see this. Hopefully, Retribution gets to play a good role in the future.
Ali being leader is the best thing ever, so much potential and alot of creative directions.
I'm just glad that wwe didn't do the pause before someone's head hits an object (steel steps)
The mystery hacker storyline is complete.
And you guys say smackdown is better then raw😂😂😂
The Heel Turn Twist🔥i didn't see coming!! Ali's Storyline just got alot more interesting!! But ngl....im still rooting for the Hurt Business tho!!!
Joins them!? He’s the leader and he was the hacker on SD from months ago as well. Bet it all becomes clear.   Awesome booking and storytelling actually. Could still go without the masks and horrible names. Should’ve just kept the ski masks and gone nameless but I’m way more behind this with him as the shot-caller.
Plot twist
Mustufa Ali was the leader of Retribution and all of their chaos they've caused
So mustafa ali is a leader now
Ya no one saw this coming
Awesome! Now let's hope the hacker storyline comes back into the scene, and that this was the reason he set up Retribution!   So well done! 👏👏
I’m in
What?! What?!
Anyone else remember that Ali was the hacker as well?
Ali has that bad guy punchable smug and i like it.
The mysteious hoodie man😱😱
The look on the faces of the Hurt Business when they realized Ali was with Retribution tho'....
squirtle has never seen a better heel turn than this
I like this♥♥
Saw this coming because he was the mystery hacker that they didn't reveal but probably will now and now we know why they didn't reveal it
Bu videoya yorum yazan ilk Türk benim
I love that they are finally pushing Ali. This is the push weve all been waiting for. 💙🖐
I KNEW ALI WAS BEHIND THIS CAUSE BEFORE WWE CANCELLED THE SD HACKER THAT LOGO WAS ALI's entrance GEAR ALI IS THE LEADER FOR RETRIBUTION
Essa reviravolta foi *DO CARALHO* 🔥🇧🇷
👎
Is the Hurt Business a face stable or heel stable?! I don't get it!   The slap around Apollo Crews, Ricochet, and the rest. But RETRIBUTION is after the Hurt Business.
Okay. This is interesting! Best heel push for Ali. Also the chest of Dijakovic got bigger. He looks buff.
no no
Well um I wasnt expecting this
¡THE BEST HELL TURN IN 2020!  Ali future champion
Okay this I’m down for
1:20 “Get ‘em!”  The hacker is the leader.
T-Bark must be mad
Just like the RKO: I never saw it coming.
Hopefully this will lead to something long lasting for Ali or whatever dumb Retribution name he'll go by from now 😂
And Now They Have Caught My Attention lol
I bet this man was the hacker too
Can't believe this for Retribution as Ali the leader
He needs to come out with his mask that hes worn before
This was very amazing and unexpected remember all the rumors saying that it was ALI that was the hacker I think retribution is a part of the smackdown hacker storyline and now Mustafa Ali turned heel and is the leader of retribution I don't think the smackdown hacker storyline was canceled
What happened to Cedric Alexander?
Hurt Business face?
I don’t care if you’re mad at this. This man deserves every moment and should be pushed to the moon. How many times has this guy come so close to glory only to have it snatched away and then get shoved aside like a nobody???? He’s been overdue for this moment. Now MUSTAFA gets to shine.
what if he was the hacker ... idk i might be reaching
not one person saw that coming
This is a very good decision Mustafa Ali actually is doing something and this was a surprise to and he should be built as a big star
I mean Ali was the Hacker so this kinda makes sense. All Ali needs to say next week is that he promised to expose everyone and walk off with retribution
I see R Truth
Best shock this year!
I did not see that coming
The tagline of SummerSlam 2020 is in full effect here!
Mustafa Ali being the leader of Retribution? We never saw it coming.
HACKER TURN!
Kinda knew it really
I’m the 52th comment
Where was Cedric?
I gotta be honest this was completely unexpected I didn’t realize what was happening until around the time he walked up to them
I love this move for mustafa ali but I hope we get explanation in the next weeks for why he is leading retribution ?
Should've ended the show imo
RETRIBUTION IS SAVED!!
This was like the best segment of the NIGHT!!!!! First, Ember Moon’s return at NXT Takeover: 31! Now, Ali revealing himself as the hacker and the leader of Retribution! Ladies and gentlemen, we did NOT see this coming!!!!
Please actually push him, the guy deserves at least a nice midcard title run
And just like that, I give a damn
Thank god
Didn't expect this from vince!!!!!!
Yo
A surprise to be sure but a welcomed one
Oh my god
This might give RAW some ratings this week!!!
🔥
Thank GOD, this KING deserves his recognition
i mean, he did need a push
Why mustapha ali why?
I'm interested again
Wasn’t he supposed to be the hacker guy on Smackdown to “expose” everyone? While he needed a push... this ain’t it. They’re probably gonna pull some bs and say he was supposed to be WWE champ and not Kofi😂😂 I can see it now.
Gonna say, I was going for Samoa Joe to be the leader, but that's a nice twist.  Lol.  Also, I love how they STILL have the fan sounds in the arena, with NO fans on the screens of the Thunderdome. Lol
Amazing plot twist
The rumors are true!
The Hacker was actually Ali😱🔥
How could he tun heel he was s good
Wow what a shock😑
Well, when you put two and two together, actually makes sense now. I guess.
Finally Ali is getting the main event push he deserves
Best
Omg he's not my favorite any more
I knew it
Hope somehow when Ali explains this, it links with the mystery promos from early this year.
Not sad about this but I am enjoying it
Is the bedt
Who did not wanted him to be part of them
I love how just like that everyone is invested in Retribution now
I hope Mustafa Ali now can bring back the hacker stuff
What a waste
Well, this is a shock
This is the only thing that mustia Ali will need to get a push
Mvp
Frist view finally
Interesting pairing
Numero Uno
Knew Ali will be the leader
FINALLY HE IS GETTING THE PUSH HE DESERVES MAN
Yes
Woah I was not expecting that
Interesting
1st
BRAVO WWE BRAVO! Best twist I’ve seen in a while
1st!!!
First
