I suspect it would be possible to beat the dragon with nothing.. Gather ender pearls and then use them to teleport on top of the end pillars (or theoretically punch the obsidian to create a staircase inside the pillars), punch out all the crystals, then slowly punch the dragon to death. You'd have to do all this while minimizing the amount of sprinting and jumping in order to conserve your hunger bar.
McDonalds never hires anymore :'(
You can do it from the ender dragon fight, people have done that already

Where did the torch come from though?? Did I miss it?
12:51 Do y'all want to go to Chernobyl and get bit by a radioactive spider and become Spider man?
We really need the smallest end update Just the smallest things added to it to make it more survivable, even if it is meant to be a desolate dimension Then again, OG Nether was just a fiery wasteland before its update, sooo....
"I started this playthrough with nothing and now I've erected" -Luke TheNotable 26:50
It is possible to kill the dragon with nothing, but you need to play on peaceful so you don't starve and you have to play it on slightly older versions that use spawn protection when entering worlds.
You could make shulker boxes
From the end fountain 26:24
I like living in the end but...  Normally after I can import a bunch of snow and pumpkins for golems, lava, water, trees, crops, both types of moss, vllagers and animals using happy ghasts, as well as some flowers to get bees from tree farming, some zombies to make , and some shulkerboxes of overworld and nether exclusives like blaze rods, sand, magma blocks, soulsand/soil, dead coral fans for TNT dupers if possible on that server, and netherrack, as well as other farmables such as mushrooms, mooshrooms, both types of nylium and fungus, glow berries, kelp.
An iron helmet with protection IV is arguably better than a diamond helmet with protection II.
The best part of the video 11:34
4 years ago is crazy, I remember coming home from school and seeing that Luke posted a new video and this was it...
How are you switching into hard-core while km game?  It can't be directly switched to  You have to go to the save files and do smth I thought
"Here's my final design and what I went with. If you don't like it, make sure to comment down below and I'll make sure not to read it. Don't get me wrong, I still love reading comments, it's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me. Yeah, you see it? Yep, they're doing it right now, quoting me! In the comments section! On my own video!"
“Sure I can’t mine but know…       Know I can kill!” Luke thenotable. Also just noticed he said “Some of you guys are unoriginal and just quote me.”
Don't quit
You can put the banner on the ground an that can be a door
First time heard from a Minecraft player diamonds are useless
9:40 oh boy how this has aged
13:10
Actually you spent millions of years in the end since time is different between the overworld and the end
I do like to try these challenges they are quite fun this one was testing my patience 😅
How did u repair ur pickaxe
I was gonna say what if he’d just made a nether portal and went to the nether? And then I realized he didn’t have a flint and steel
25:16 "Wow, what is this monstrosity!" thats what i tell myself everyday when i look in the mirror
If you hear a mic buzz it’s actually just the end soundtrack so lol
16:40 IM SORRY DID HE JS CURSEEE??HUUHUHUHUH
that purple fruit is going to turn you into ender men if you keep eating it
I'm gonna try this but I start with trees and a stack of wood

how did you get the torch tho????
Ok sounds like a little more than I can get it for a while I have a little time for the next couple weeks so I’m going out of the shower now I will let you know if you I’m acting like a bot 🤖
2:58 day ur momma is crazy
Luke degloatable exposed
WHAT did he do with ts other hand
Love your videos please don't touch kids in future
26:40 1940
The more you watch the more you realize that luke is going crazy
Can somebody count how many fortresses he loot I’m to autistic
I actually guess it was a farm :D
5:37 *title card*
“At least i won’t get diddled” HOW DID HE KNOW
5:38 i guess you arn't [title card]
The fact that he could have made a shulker box at anytime got me rolling 😂😂😂
26:25 Ok but how _did_ you get the torch? >.>
why does the monnument look like hitler?
Hey, luke, I did not know That you  used to work at mcdonald's When was your first day And what inspired do you To make a hardcore Minecraft videos
9:41 Bro predicted Diddy😂
26:40 um…
So how did he get the torch? Genuinely asking.
100 days but you replace all of the Minecraft sound files with your impression of the sound. For example walking-on-grass sound effect would be Luke trying to imitate the sound.
Did he mean hes dog that is adopted
Imagine doing the old nether
you could have put the iron trapdoor on the top pf the doorway and then place a banner on the trapdoor
Is this a minecraft version of a homeless guy surviving the projects?
22:19 hey right here he ate a end fruit but didn’t teleport? I’m not saying he’s cheating but what’s the chance of this happening?
You're no nearly what????
11:36 blue killed white!!
where did he get the torch?- *laughs at the video*
I don't think that statue looks like Alex
god gave his only begotten son for our sins and you mock him like this how dare this nobody
‏‪26:40‬‏ 🙋‍♂️🇩🇪
why didnt bro just make a shulker box
16:43 bro lost his family friendly status 😅
Cave sounds can play in the end?
11:50
This is the perfect representation on why WE. NEED. AN. END. UPDATE.
Where did he get the torch from though I’m confused???
I guess that one guy's comment was right
hitler
the monument is hitlel
“100 days in the hood”
You can combine ALL tool's and armor to fix them
9:40 bro used “diddled” before the scandal  Bro is diddy confirmed
They will not stop asking me to do this.
wouldnt a shulker box solve all his inventory problems
heaven does exist

Stairway to heaven thats a good joke
Is anyone else watching this at 5:48 am while hungry and wanting quesadillas?
Couldn't you have used iron trapdoors as your roof for more height? Or a purpur and trapdoor floor for the nice pattern which could fulfill the same purpose

I normally play on either 105 or quake pro, youre just getting old bro

We needa get a rebooted version of this once the end update comes out.

14:19 that ambience fits
8:12 AH! AH! HE SAID IT!
17:59 damm
10:42  He’s right. It doesn’t exist.   Yeah, it sounds negative. Just rip that band aid off now.
17:58 nice joke

9:38 dude was before his time with the diddiled joke
Nice everything tbh
Just use enderpearls to climb the pillars and hit the dragon in the head to do more damage
I FUCKING CANT USE THE COMMAND IT DOESNT WORK
Wait. This was posted 3 years ago. At  9:40 Luke said “Atleast I won’t get diddled.” How did he know?
09:37 how does he know about diddy even though this was 3 years ago
You could beat the enderdragon with nothing, it'd just be very inefficient and take much longer than 100 days. You'd have to punch a staircase in the obsidian up to each crystal, break them, and then punch the enderdragon to death with your fist everytime it comes down to perch
The pixel art might invade poland if you dont watch over it
11:36 dont mind me, just saving this
shulker box
6:28 you know what else is massive
I'm watching this at the turn of the New Year. I did this because I'm too tired to play Minecraft.
THIS WAS 3 YEARS AGO??!?!
someone tell me how he got the torch
9:40 He predicted it

God loves you
Freaky ahh enderman at thumbnail
and in the end, the dragon was slayed
Honestly the end is my favorite dimension in minecraft. Would be nice if we ever got another end update similar to the nether update. If they added trees and other food sources I'd be happy.
"Ill be scraping but atleast I won't get diddled" Bro made a 2024 dark humor joke without realizing it 💀💀
9:40  predicted Diddy 3 year ago?
Lifeless void dudu dudududu

9:38 he knew… he predicted it.
“Chorus fruit “sure… 27:38
18:51 hearing this as an og luke thenotable fan made me smile
the fact that you managed to make this video interesting is impressive
All the endermen have autism
you may not do this ine again but maybe a mudded one in then future?? maybe maybe not lol or maybe if it gets a update with ore and new wood and trees lolol.  also this wasn't just a end challenge this was a no crafting table challenge too thats tourture
I’m confused because you said god doesn’t exist at one point jokingly are you Christian LTN
16:44 Guys he swore!!!

August 2024. No Day 53 NFTs found on a quick Google search.  Why have you forsaken us? :[
Can you plz try the better end mod next time you do an end video plz
Play on bedrock it has a day counter
Look forward to seeing you do a 2nd one of these when the end hopefully gets updated
I’m pretty sure if you update your version to bedrock you have a chance to find a flint and steel in a chest in an end city and with that you can go to the nether then the overworld, have a nice day! ❤
Heaven exists.
Nice floor 😁🎉
Use underparts to break crystals then punch dragon  Ender pearl into the gate
" its not like you can unwatch this video" you underestimate my willingness to drink sir
7:03
Just don’t use that method of fixing items if they’re enchanted. You lose the enchants and the levels. I use that method all the time cause it’s cheaper than an anvil and more convenient than a grind stone.
13:53 ‘:( Apathy is Death
When I heard this 25:11 I instantly went to the comments, immediately proving the point, but it's funny that everyone one else did it just to comment
And their kids will be horribly disabled 😂
"dont get me wrong i do love reading comments but most of them are unoriginal and just quote me"
Okay but like… where did he get that torch actually?
bro tried to nutshot the enderdragon
Toreno TORENOOO
heaven exists.
Got an idea for you how about trying “surviving a 100 days” random block placement
11:36 *A M O G U S*
"Legggggssssss*
"They're doing it right now. Quotin' me. In the comment section."
i love this guy, but i dont like how he joked about heaven not being real. Thats not right
what would be a video without you, (Luke The Notable), building a base, or even more importantly a wall..
2:22 luke casually "pounding" and "smashing" that enderman
Day 3 of commenting on a random video of Luke’s until he uploads a 100 days amplified video
I love your house
Luke, when you switched from creative to "hardcore" it said you switched to survival mode - but you still have the hardcore hearts. I'm confused.
he’s doing better starting his world in the end on day 15 in hardcore mode then I am in my easy survival world (not hardcore) that I am on day 147 on 💀💀
Came back after 2 years. And this video reminds me that: People want an End update but if you stop to think. They can't do the same way they did with the Nether. The End is that type of dimension that you aren't supposed to be possible to live in without any pre-brought products, like tree sapplings, dirt, and etc. The End is supposed to be like a DEAD dimension, no life in there, and the only minimal life there is... is quite obscure.
17:48
AMOGUS
bro you die so much
You can leave the island with out killing the dragon the other island's are just really far there like a million blocks out
100 days with reversed controls
25:22  PP plant
Wait he is in hardcore mode how is he respawning
Can't u just use the regular chests to make shulker chest
13:21 me casually on the toilet rn watching thing with diarrhea
Bro forgot about shulker boxes and went for ender chests lol
Is  anyone have problems create the end portal
I find this video quite notable
Hey at 25:06 the floor looks AWESOME
you could get to the nether using the fire from the end crystals to light the chests on fire and  got wood from the nether to craft shulker boxes.
26:24 how did you get it though? we need answers... now
Did anyone realize that he was using onomatopoeia basically the word form of the noises used for fighting
tbh, after 3 years i know notice that the enderman in the title has a open mouth, i thought it was a enderman with a italian mustache
9:41 did he predict all the diddy parties
Hey Luke, even after you traveled far far away from your base,how were you able to find it again
Dunno if anyone else has said this and I'm like 3 yrs late but he could have used one of the end gateways
11:44 looney toons ahh clip
11:36 *among us*
this video is just dungeon reset but in minecraft
Anybody notice that he said shi-
ok the beginning is not fully impossible  so what you do is, break the obsidian on the towers into a stair formation to climb all of them to break every crystal, then wait for the dragon to perch and kill it with your fist, then kill an enderman and land a pearl into one of the outer island portals from the ground  possible but would take literally months
Honestly I watch more for the commentary then for a Minecraft video this guy is hilarious
I wish of u play modded one
*"AMONG GUS"*
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
“I always fly with my balls out”💀
fun fact! when you download the world file, and press the "f3" key, look for the days, it only says 54 days, can't accuse luke of faking 100 days because the end has no day/night cycle
I just started working at McDonald’s as well. My Notable arc has begun.

“My infant daughter had a nasty poo so I had to go” wonderful
WHERED HE GET THE TORCH? HE NEVER TALKS ABOUT THE TORCH? HES CHEATING! HE WENT IN CREATIVE I SAAAAAAW
26:24 , he got the torch from the bedrock Pillar at the end portal
11:50 ENDER WHATS OUT?!
where tf did the torch come from😭
I think I'd actually play minecraft again if they had an ambiance update and an end dimension update. Imagine the end but with different biomes and new mobs like the nether. Itd be sick  Edit: Seggs update

“Wow, that’s messy” -Luke thenotable
I hate your base nega
How can the End be the End if it is endless? I'm losing my mind. I don't know if that's good or bad lol
* sigh * alright I'll play minecraft... again (I'm a PE guy cause i can't figure out the keyboard and mouse thing)

Feed me 100 likes or I’ll starve :(                          Idk why I want them I’m not even a YouTuber am I insane?
i wrote this down it is true my infant daughter had a nasty poo- doctor seus and luke the notable
Video idea: do 100 days hypixel skyblock. Id love to see that
Like a notable person once said: "A wall is peace of mind"
I think the most notable thing about this video is that even though he hated doing it he did it anyway
Nothing to eat but chorus fruit. Scrounging ender pearls. So he's teleporting all the time. What if endermen are all past versions of steve, whose body became too influenced by the end, or died there. And everytime this happened his soul reincarnated into a new steve. Maybe that's why they aggro when making eye contact, they see your soul and want it back.
Should've called the video "The end" with a sad face thumbnail
18:06 woah there you let your inside voice out
Bro can kill the ender dragon now
And make shucker box bro
Mine the obsidian and go to the nether and make one more to the overworld. Use your brain bro
you remind me of mitten squad
I find it funny like played a ww1 by using trench warfare against the dragon
the torture he passed
Imagine this same challenge, except every end city had ONE oak plank block.  Small, but impactful change.
You should do a survival in th end with the tors
If we ever get that end update, we'll need a second one of these
Erm actually he found the torch at the end island 🤓☝️
THE TORCH 26:25
"dont get me wrong, i love reading comments but most of you are unoriginal and quote me"
i loved the baby shark reference  even though baby shark is overrated as hell
Bro haz latters
but actually how did he get the torch??
Meanwhile I'm begging him to make Shulker boxes...
I just have one question? How the hell did you get a torch in the end???????
At 22:17 he eats a courus fruit and doesn't teleport
Accidentally skipped from beginning to end, kinda funny
the good old time Luke, back then when he didn't know he could combine items with the anvil and had the inventory full of iron?😂
Minecraft still has eight years to add trees to the end.
We morphing into Soren Minecraft Story Mode with this one 🗣🗣‼️‼️
why does the monument kinda look like hitler??

I know that yiu dsµ”vhfrfewwqbgnhwxmj,samdb7vfyctrhge432s

You should do this again but combined with creative
The start: Nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever does
“You see, yup they’re doing it right now. Quoting me, in the comment section, in my own video”  Did this cause yes, that’s all. Please have cup of coffee ☕️ and have a nice day
cheese dimension
I lived 200 days in the end i hwve god mode mod
Isnt there a crafting table in end cities sometimes? Maybe im thinking of something else
Could you imagine if you just, GAVE yourself a single crafting bench. Nothing else and you’d be solid!
100 days skyblock
this proves that an end update NEEDS to happen
You inspire me so l I'm gonna tell everyone a quote  today was a good day besides that arrow in my nutsack -luke thenotable
Day 2 of convincing Luke to make 1000 days with Tors
I feel like luke has some personal issues and takes it out on Minecraft mobs
Problem in bedrock is that endermen lose interest in you after so much time they leave before you can kill them with you fist

enderballs got me🤣
He got the tourch from the dragon fight island
This is like the Minecraft lore where he went to the end and all he could eat was chorus fruit and then he turned into an Enderman is that you really really fucking cool
Jokes on you I have dementia, I will unwatch your video, HAHAHAHA!
"9:15" - LukeTheNotable, 2021
“There they are quoting me” 💀
You should survive 100 days in a mushroom island
I guess even tho it took a couple times in the end it all worked out        Im unfunny ik
10:43 instant unsub
bro be careful because if you eat chorus fruit everyday for a long time, eventually you'll become an enderman. matpat said so i think
where you get ladders from?
Don't eat too many chorus fruit or you might turn into an Enderman!
the torch is from killing the dragon ?
Does a neather portal work in the end ?
I would enjoy seeing you play sky factory
Where did Luke get that crafting table
"Yep. They're doing it right now. Quoting me in the comment section" -Luke
hell nah youre the biggest cheater ever the dragon is easily beatable just get the pearels tp up to the pillars then after ur done with that kill the dragon with ur fists its just easily possible
He FORGOT shulker boxes
5:16 what a rhyme?! This is true. My infant daughter had a nasty poo 😂
How did you find so much in Settings so quick?🤷🏻
11:34 from the end cities you can get chess I’m killing the little things inside you can get the box then you put a whole bunch of boxes with your stuff in it and then put it in the end chest
Yes ofc 3 enderpearls in a full 20 mn day, lmao

I HEARD ALL THAT HISING. I SHALL HEAR EVERY MISTAKE.
why the hardcore hearts tho? does thiz meen heiy cheeet on hardcore?
🙂.........
cant wait for 200 days when we get an end update
stattue looking like hitler
"Yep they are quoting me" -luke the notable 2021
You can pearl to the top of the pillars, use the relog invincibility to break the crystals, and brutalize the dragon with your fist
So depressing
how did you go to creative mode in hardcore
LukeTheNotable is lucky he found so many end city
Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me  -LTN 2021
the dragon death animation is SO COOL!!!
bro forgot his mic was on... oh SH...
I did. like the nether challenge one on PE… wasn’t that hard not counting the luck elements
2:22 Just imagine being an enderman and you see a man in hole that has multiple openings with seventy-eight chorus fruit, eight ender pearls and eleven chorus roots, beating up your friend with his bare hands as he shouts every synonym for the word "punch" with each strike.
But you don't use shulker boxs
Some parts of the video made me die in laughter
Did no one else notice that he could have crafted a few shulker boxes, or was it just me?

"if it's got a door, it's home" Luke the notable. I can't even lie, I have so much respect for the time that Luke devotes to his viewers and fans. He spends hours, weeks probably even years to provide us content that we enjoy.  Respect to you.
what about 100 days in terraria?
He has ladders in his house
There was an end portal to get back to the main land so he wouldn't have to build the bridge 🤦‍♂️  15:10
Lol
I wanted to play Minecraft while my mom and dad weren't here but this channel kept keeping me from playing.
as annoying as it is  end bases are the best
the torch is from the dragon island’s bedrock portal
I DON’T LIKE IT! (You told me to, i actually really liked that floor design.)
11:33 Luke: Still got a lot of loot in there, my inventory is already looking pretty "sus"       A M O N G   U S
Do you like AMONG US
why not mine the whole building after clearing it?
Luke: "If it has a door, it's home." Me: "You've been homeless the entire series!"
18:32 😎
i love your house😳😳😳
Do you know about the existence of shulkerchests?
This is a cool concept. If someone griefed on your world, you could banish them to the end with nothing, and the only way to escape is eventually beating the ender dragon.

"dont get me wrong. I love resding comments. its just that most of you are unoriginal and just quote me." Yeah, I hate those kind of people.
He got the torch from the portal btw
I love the design luke do 100 drops in call of duty
The amogus joke is fun lol
200 days in the end!
Day your mom
See their they are, quoting me on my own video
One dirt block + one oak sapling would’ve completely changed this video. Still Notable/10
"Go ahead, quote me on my own video" lol
According to game theory Luke is going to become an enderman soon
27:54 not me thinking you off screen built a dinosaur but it's just the end city at the perfect angle XD
where did he get the torch tho
Random idea  100 days using blinds randomizer data  pack, it’ll still be vanilla Minecraft technically
I once was in a mc role play where I was an enderman, I only ate chorus fruit. It was a choice.
i play on quake pro
Does anyone know how he actually got the torch for his house?
3:02   lol dat your mom
Luke was like oh shi my mics on. He finnally swore
How DID you get a torch though?
Ender balls...💀 11:49
AMONG US...💀 11:33
In the end it doesn't even matter
If it gets boring, you should get BetterEnd but it's basically just the overworld and OP, and I would indeed like to use Wood or something.
bro never explained the torch

This is not Minecraft. It's Mine. No crafting bench, no crafting. Just Mine.
Where DID he get the torch though?
I'm pretty sure it's possible to beat the dragon bare, you just have to mine your way up each obsidian pillar and punch the crystal in a way that you don't take damage, then kill the dragon by punching it  as it perches
Wait, Where did he get a torch? Is he cheating? Did he go in creative? Who knows?
I can't tell if he said heaven doesn't exist in minecraft or if heaven doesn't exist irl T_T
At 27:56 the end city kinda looks like a dinosaur
Luke! We need a 200 days end! When the update finally comes out. If it coumes out.
my brother in notability, WHY  DID YOU NOT MAKE ANY SHULKER BOXES. YOU HAD EVERYTHING YOU NEEDED. I KNOW YOU KNOW THEY EXIST BECAUSE YOU HAVE USED THEM BEFORE. YET YOU STILL COMPLAINED ABOUT HAVING A FULL INVENTORY AUAUUAAUAUAGAHGHGAHFGHDSGHFGA.
I died 3 times when i tried but i continued going and i was succsefful
this world is doomed why is the most replayed  part of your video is LTN moaning
Why is Luke’s voice so comforting?
Aren't u invisible Brad from Henry danger
If anyone thinks he really is cheating because of the torch he got it from the end portal at the dragon island
Did you know that the guy who wrote baby shark killed his wife😂
the floor looks great
How did your get ladders
Do Minecraft but you cant make or use a crafting table in the overworld
25:17 “quoting me, on my own video” Luke the notable, 2021
10:42 he meant in minecraft
"Of course you can see out of the eyes, that's a staple of my monuments"   The 100 days badlands monument: 😶
He forgot he could make shulker boxs u don’t need a a crafting table to make I think
“The treasures a lot better that trying to get better with the corus”  -LTN
I somewhat tried this only adding a couple dirt and sapplling and cob gen.😅
Heaven does exist
You died on day four and then on day five you’re alive again this is some kind of trick?
Challenge accepted. If i should fail then its back to indev hell for 100 days.
“AMONG US” 💀💀🤣
10:10 it's not about how it looks, it's about how you use it
Achievement: "Free the End" Luke: Oh I wouldn't say 'free', more like under new management.
But where did he get the torch from
I was cringing for the first half cuz he never made a shulker box and didn’t even use a enderchest
11:36 AMONGUS
To start from the middle could actually have been possible, by mining up the obsidian towers and take the healers one by one... using only the hand.
Honestly this is his most impressive feat in my opinion
with your narrating skills you turned a boring topic and video into a good one
😢😢😢
26:40 that doesn't look like alex...
Its been 2 YEARS WHAT
Love it
You can use f3 to see what day it is if you are in java
23:19 the duolingo correct ding in the background tho
2:59 day ur mom
Yep your just quoting me
2:31 man speedrunners lie, it is easy to get enderpearls
i just thought of something could he use the obsidion to go to the nether and then go to the overworld? he just needs something to light it
Why is the shulker box on the thumbnail blue?
in hard core bro
Okay so can you use the pearls to get on To a ENDER dragon pillar and just keep doing that and beat the ender dragon that way
*the legs!*💀
pur pur block exist
200 days?
Next do 100 days adventure mode
Your my fav and I will help you get 10mill
I don't think starting on the dragon fight is impossible. You can use ender pearls from the endermen to get to the crystals and break them. Then wait for the dragon to perch and start slapping her. So it's possible but takes a crap ton of time. Like ur mom sized amount of time
He got the torch from the bedrock dragons perch
I'm I the only one that exclusively plays on quake pro😭
0:27 Fighting ender dragon with nothing is possible, but VERY HARD, especially in hardcore
i dont like it
3:00  it's so old he said " day u r m O m"
If anyone was wondering how he got a torch for his base: He stole one from the end portal which had 4  (Also it really dosen't matter but this playthrough was 108 days if we count the nights as a day as well since normally he sleeps)
A notable man once journeyed afar across the desolate islands of the End. After countless lanky screaming nerds died, he had stacks of dark green balls to his name. He teaches us that no matter how loudly the dragon may roar, you can still farm content.
*now i get can get my first placble block end rods*he forgot about cores flowers?
"Quoting me in the commet section" Luke TheNotable
23:36 ok
Bro can get netherite armor and a op house when he makes a video titled "I spent a 100 days in the void -minecraff" 😂😂😂
:o
"Yep. You're doing it right now. Quoting me. In the comment section. On my own video,"  - Luke The Notable.
If u used cheats to spawn in the end how did u get the advancement “Free The End”??
elytra to towers to hit the end crystals with blast protection armor.
Fun fact: 1 minecraft day is 10 minutes
How dare you disrespect the Holy Trinity. 10:41
BEDROCK IS BETTER!!!!   JAVA IS STUPID!!!!!!!
Luke is the only one who did 100 days in the end dimension with no mods
nice
An idea  make the tors place wood dirt and sapling hidden  around  the islands
how did he get a torch.
Hey wait who is Luke having kids with in the end? Are there enderwomen?
Ah yes, the luke must do the labour
next video idea: 100 days on the Moon in Vanilla Minecraft (April Fools Update)
Actually had to question where he got the torch. Either an end ship or from the end island where the dragon egg is kept
You can put the banner on the ground and walk through it
I’m trying this challenge but I’m having real trouble getting ended pearls. Whenever I go down in the hidey hole and lead Endermen down there, after giving them a whack or two they teleport out of the hole and eventually de agro. Then when I come back up out of the hole there’s like 10 Endermen and I have no idea which one I’ve slightly damaged. I’ve died at least 7 times by trying to more efficiently kill Endermen.
inserting yourself into minecraft lore explained by matpat be like:
'yep you see it they're doing it right now, quoting me in the comment section on my own video' Luke TheNotable 2021
its possible to beat ender drangon without anything almost. step1: kill endermen for pearls, teleport to the crystals with them, and down with teleport to the other ones with another pearls. break all the crystals. then get down. step2: kill the enderdrangon hit it when its down. step3: teleport to the portal that makes you go to outer end islands with a pearl. EASY IQ
bro even has an infant and still plays minecraft💀
when you said "AMOUG US" you got me runing out my room-
" Yeah you see it, yup, their doing it right now, quoting me, in the comment section, on my own video. " Haha🤣25:07
O yeah and the nether has hoglens so you can get pork chop
Well obsidian can teleport you to the nether and the nether has wood fortress and bashton plus you can get ender pearls so there you go people
Bro said “am going to make this roof smal but a least I won’t get didonld ” 😂😂
I’m confused. At a few different points in the video, you see end gateways even though he didn’t kill the dragon. Can someone pls explain
21:15  me
16:44 did u try to cuss?
Don't look at the Endermen. It's a rough neighborhood and they'll go off for literally no reason at all.
I am trying to live and die and Maria this is so freaking hard
2:59 / 29:41 day your mom?
" you see it yep they're doing it right now quoting me in the comments section on my own video."
the fact that you did this is very notable, genuinly
What a notable video
nobody: Luke TheNotable: "Dont get me wrong I love reading comments, its just most of you are unoriginal and just quote me. I can see it, yep your doing it right now, quoting me, in the comment section on my own video."
Does Luke not know that he can kill shulkers for shells and use slik touch on chests and craft shulker boxes?
How he use alex
I love your videos
Do a hundred days hypixel skyblock
you should do 100 days in desert
11:36 A M O N G  U S
Luke thenotable cheated in day urmom 2:57
Man knows how to ryhm
'Most of you guys are pretty un-original, you kinda just quote me'
You died, the title should be, "i died in the end hardcore"
Woowi life it
Luke you are so notable :)
the place where getting wings is possible but a wooden bench isn't
im gonna sing a song for you when the days are cold and the cards all fold and the saints we see are a made of gold when your dreams all fail and the wonts we hail are the worst of all when the lights fade out.
"Don't get me wrong, I still love reading comments, it's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me."
bro this is the great depresion
100 days in amoung us
If you think about it, once you’ve read the dictionary, everything else is just a remix.
It’s not impossible if your not in hardcore you can just break obsidian that forms a staircase till the towers
Dragon Facts: The reason your sword was sometimes now working is because the dragon's damage hitbox isn't in its back. Instead, you should try to hit it in the head. It hurts me to watch otehr players attack the dragon in the neck, because hitting it in the head does more damage, even with a melee weapon.
“What about the torch!” Me, who knows he got it from the bedrock portal: “He’s fine”
Part 2!!!!!!!!
I'm an endstone miner, and my children will be endstone miner, and their children will be endstone miner, and their children will be horribly disabled from all the inbreeding. I guess that's pretty normal in North Korea.
How to do this : Kill endermen to get ender pearls to teleport onto the obsidian pillars and break the end crystals. Then, punch the dragon when it’s perched until it dies. Use an ender pearl to teleport through the end gateway and onto the end islands. Then, loot end cities for gear and tools. Easy, right?
There's a problem on day 12 or 13  The first end city he got a diamond chest plate with curse of binding but on day 12 or 13 he flew with an eletra, he never said anything about it breaking or even if he put it on
AMOG US REFERENCE????!?! 😱😱😱😱 go to 11:33
"Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me"                                  -LukeTheNotable
Luke has become such a legend that when he gets back to the overworld he’ll probably go full hermit wondering how to make a crafting table   Living in the end does that to people
he def cheated with the torch
So you got the torch from the center end island portal...
You could build a neather portal and light it with the end crystals
11:34
when 1.20 comes out do 100 days in the cherry blossom biome that would be cool if not do 100 days in the swamp
how git torch
DAY UR MOM : the best, day, ever!
Seriously though where did you get the torch
hey im trying 2 beat old minecraft
How did you get the torch though
Bacon
Ladders...........
22:12 HUH
You made out a 100 days of cheats in Minecraft And you say there we go cheating on day one

“Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me”-Luke the notable
Imagine 1000 days…..
The End is my favourite dimension in Minecraft.
When LTN said "Day your mom." Ive never felt such despair, in the eyes of judgement of my mom I crumbled. His words broke through my ego, my honor, my pride and i was at every loss. There were no benefits of the events that had happened, in turn I cried.
Endrod. MY FIRST PLACEABLE BLOCK! meanwhile the popped chorus block
wait... how do you know when a day has past THIS IS THE END THERES NO DAY OR NIGHT ITS JUST VOID
You could dig two blocks underneath the portal put a piston and a lever power the piston while you and the piston are under the lot portal and your at the end islands
Even if a thrived living in the end might actually make me stop playing the game
Teenagers and Mcdonalds is like a symbiotic relationship
You most kill the dragon with a shovel
It would take a very long time and be very hard, but you could break stairs out of the obsidian tower and kill the Ender dragon with your fist
Now I will do this
E
WOW everyone else uses the better end mod-WELL DONE
The remaking the teleport into your house, so the wall make no sense wall is stupid
It's better to let someone think you are an Idiot than to open your mouth and prove it.🙃
11:36  this got me
But how you get the torch?????
Am I building a staircase no not to heaven it doesn't exist -luke the notable
No, but really what did you do with you're outher hand?😮
I ❤ ur videos
17:51😂😂
Luke you can get your self stuck in end by simply placing bed under end portal and it gets you stuck permanently even on non hardcore
Reference to 100 drops hit me hard   Great vid❤
I just finished watching Family Ties theme song over and over until my heart finally melted.  Where's my Michael J. Fox moment?  I'm going to take my Delorean to 98 mph to get the flux capacitor the necessary 1.21 gigawatts to be able to go finally to the End?
I think he’s going insane 13:20
You have to hit the dragon's HEAD
3:38 how did you get ladders
im creating an unwatch button
I just started this challenge this morning but i did start with an iron sword and diamond pick unenchanted
Love the house u made
Yeah we need an end update
7:50 he ended overpopulation in the end
"Yup, you're quoting me, in the comment section, on my own video."
I will now be adding "enjoy it while you can, vermin!" to my lexicon.

no honestly though how did he get a torch?
A m o n g u s  - lukethenotable
i loveit
2:44 and everytime we kiss i swear i can fly
According to Matpat, this challenge is how Endermen came into existence in the first place, where eating only chorus fruit corrupted their bodies and gave them the ability to teleport
he's always using hardcore texturepack (command says changed to survival not hardscore)
"don't quote me" - Luke TheNotable
hey Luke ur so cool!
luke complained about ender chests while passing up perfect opportunities just to make us mad and that's hilarious
How did you die and have your stuff back in hardcore? How are you using cheats in hardcore?
every time i try doing the challenge i end up loseing on like day 7
“qoute me”
My first placeable block  Courous flour: am I a joke to you
It hurt to watch him say the silk touch pickaxes wasn’t working but it was because it has curse of vanishing 😭
Day 36 You can hear a vacuum blasting as he’s mining to a chest
I love it how you could hear his daughter in the back 17:34
How
Started at a doctor Mike video with about 50% battery. 25% now. Oh BuT hOw CaN iT hApPeN?!?! *I fell asleep*
bro said heavens dont exist💀
Luke TheQuotable (got the idea from 25:10)
26:40 so we're not going to talk about the hitler monument?
how did you figure out that it was a new day just questioning
1942 is when the statue was made😅
crazy this man was in the end, surrounded by shulkers, and had inventory problems
Luke gave me a fucking headache after he mentioned the hissing sound, now I can't get it out of my head, shit.
How did you get the chests If there's no wood in the end How Just how just How the heck did you get those chests
How did you really get a torch I am guessing you got it from the ender dragon fight island portal
why didn’t you add a slab  on the door through the Wall

There are crafting tables in the end
How did he know it’s the next day?
Yeah I started a hundred days video, I'm only on day 5 and I'm already realizing how hard this is gonna be
I’ve done a similar challenge(unwillingly) to this in a survival multiplayer server, it was difficult and I died a lot but it’s quite fun
You should try farming ender men more often.
Try moving into a end city and build a wall around it and form a tree farm.
This is why you should have started with 2 stone picks, 2 stone axes, 64 blocks of dirt, 30 pieces of bamboo, 4 golden carrots, and 40 red berries.
My man is a ancient builder
16:44 rare LTN swear.
Hevan is real
19:18
26:25 he got it from ender dragon island because on that bedrock  fountain is 4 torches
Hevan exists
monument looks like hitler tho
your floor can be bottom layer slabs and that is 1 extra block and no enderman spawns because mobs cant spawn on slabs
101 days in acustom biome
It might be fun to continue the playthrough but remove the End restriction. Just go back to the overworld and take a breath of fresh air as you cut down your first tree, and eat something other than chorus fruit. Then eventually you can go back to your End house and appreciate how far you've come.
I know you don't use mods for these challenges, but consider making an exception for the better end mod. Like, start the challenge from scratch, but this time with the mod installed, it would be very cool
Why does the video only have 7.9k likes and no dislike option, weird
just make purfur blocks
You can actually attempt to kill the Ender dragon from the get go, ender pearling into it does a bit of damage! Unless they patched it 🤣😅
where... DID he get the torch? do they spawn in end cities or ships?
I tried an end challenge once, it was too tedious. The nether was much more fun
The waffle house has found its new host
Bro is going crazy 💀
Mojang: makes a new dimension. LukeTheNotable: ****
11:02 yes stone age cave men and women used wings to fly around and were in diffrent diemensions
I watched this in ten seperate parts on tiktok and liked it so much that I came here afterwards to like the video 👍
My idea for a challenge: beat minecraft but you start in the end with nothing and, and only after you kill the dragon you can go to the overworld, but you must immediately just go to the nether and survive there until youve killed the wither and then you can go to the overworld xD
real reason he stalled the ender dragon fight was because he woulda had nothing else to do  after he killed it at 70 days lol.
Wait, how did you count the days when in the end it’s always night time?
Why didn't you make a iron door and a  Pressure plate
15:06
I might try this challenge. Looks traumatizing.
Remember To Pray Before Eating And Drinking. Spread The Gospel.
Who else wants end trees and ores
His monument looked a lot like Hitler
How did he get those ladders
You can actually put 2 anything together to combine the items together and add the durability.  Ps. In Minecraft Java edition if u hover the mouse over an item it will tell u its effects. For example, swords would show the swords damage.
Heaven does exist, God is real, Jesus Christ is your savior.
Technically you can kill endermen until you get pearls, use said pearls to break the crystals, and then slowly whittle the dragon but I'm not sure anyone wants to see that.
Heaven does exists turn to Jesus ❤
3:33 how did he get ladders
I’ve been watching this video since last year
Idea: Take the chests that had the loot in them, and combine those with the shulker shells from the shulkers you killed. Storage is needed. All you need now is a crafting table... oh wait... it's the end.
hey luke i tried this really hard you are notable
Luke: "healing takes a while" Bedrock players: °-°
its cool that you can start in the end and earn your way to the overworld
Luke you are in hardcore and you died,How did you come back?
Do a hundred days in the nether?
Lol
Do you know that if you go into f3 you can see your day count???
Do you know that if you go into f3 you can see your day count???
Alternate title: Local Man Goes Insane With Greed and Lack Of Crafting Table
Tried this challenge. I sucked so badly. I died like 8 times before I got to day 5. It is now day 37 and my death count is 17. can't believe you did this in hardcore Luke. you are a legend.
you could have made a nether portal with the dragon
I DON'T LIKE IT
The Nether 100 days was a testament to both your skill and the quality of the respective update, the End?  Truly a demonstration of notability  (and how much the End needs an update, lol)
“Not to heaven, heaven doesn’t exist”😅
i love your home
22:18 did he eat a Chorus and not teleport
I’m not gonna quote you

Lifeless void doo doo doo doo
Your a dad Omg I never knew that that’s great
And i still havent beaten the dragon normally
hi.
It doesn't work?
i did 69 days at the end
Wait… Ik he made a joke on it but like where did he actually get the torch from
You cheat
14:22
11:49
Maybe you should do 100 days random drops or 100 days sideways gravity?
broo you should’ve gone through the portal at the end, way more climatic
If they ever have another end update, they really need to give the end its own kind of wood.
...
20:56 No I'm doing your nether one but with 2 change 1 it's bedrock so I'm playing normal  2 I start with golden boots and a wooden pickaxe
how does he know what day it is?
Make nether portal and get netherite
100 days in infinite Village
I love how calls diamonds useless in this video
u have to hit the head
"Thankfully I had my Enderpearls so I was okay" *takes fall damage before pearl lands*
man if only this man made shulker boxes early on
Luke: chorus fruit is my only food Me: but you found seeds in a che- oh wait, there isn’t dirt in the end.
Bruh what about the shulker boxes  Edit: forgot u need a chest and a crafting table
*Minecraft* in the background Despair
but on day 6 where did you get those ladders?
Ender balls 11:47

Ok Luke i promise i wont ever comment something you said ever again.
TECHNICALLY… He said “There is no day night cycle” so, basically he’s only doing 1 day. We need to stop being scammed smh.. 😔
14:06 LMAO
YOU ARE SO GOOD AT BUILDING
200 days of the end
But seriously were did he get the torch it was before he killed the ender dragon so he didn’t get it from there?
"waw what is it this monstrosity" - Luke TheNotable  Yes I quoted you >:)
Can we get a 4000 days for The End?
What if you get 3 days in the overworld every 100 days in the end.
did he ever consider shulka boxes
Day 72, ladder in the corner of the base, how?
nice job luke!
11:36 among us
As someone that eats gas station food while on the road for work im insulted
15:07 it’s not fruitless, what have you been eating this whole time
Luke really read All quiet on the western front and said "aight bet, let me make these trenches better"
It could be possible to start from the main island
But where DID he get the torch?
This was the first 100 days that came out after I found this channel.
100 days on a bad seed island
I found three end cities and all of the has and end ship

I feel like this is the first video I've watched that has no use for diamonds
I literally fall asleep to you dawg, no homo
Aren’t there occasionally crafting tables in end cities?
It s sad that is not gonna make 200 days end
What? No, ender pearls will actually help you, you can destroy the end crystals with them. It is possible to beat the dragon starting from nothing.
14:22 I thought he was going insane
100 days minecraft end with tors
amongus
Where DID he get that torch?
Dragon is immune to enchants, so I think that caused the sword to stop working
BE NOTABLE!
now do 100 days in minecraft but its also 100 days in real life and you have to do everything you do in minecraft to some extent in real life also
yk it's possible to kill the ender dragon with your fists and literally nothing else not even blocks to piller up to the tower
Luke should've used those diamonds and gold and make them into blocks.
Luke TheNotable is a lot like JackSepticEye, he just starts saying random crap at random intervals 😂
theoretically you could grind endermen by punching them in a safe hole and then pearl up to the pillars and do some real mlg pearl stuff to avoid taking damage as much as possible and maybe possibly survive to be able to punch out the ender dragon when the pillars are gone and finally pearl into the place where the episode starts
16:44 "Oh shit, my mic's on!"
Now do 200 days of the end
"Its just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me."
how he get wood?
5:15 had me 😂😂
26:51 that looks like a long haired Hitler
But where did the torch come from???
I used your coordinates and spawned right next to a end city
fake fake fake fake
why did he forget he could make shulker boxes
I mean, technically, you could punch obsidian until it breaks to clime up to each crystal, break them, then punch the dragon to death. Might take 100 real world days, but possible.
a year later I've just realised WHERE DID YOU GET THE WOOD FROM?
My atheism started from this video
Cool
100 days in the deep dark that's what we want
“Yep there quoting me right now down there” - Luke TheNotable
11:36
You could craft shulker boxes by killing shulkers and mining chests
How da fak he got chest
25:15 yep quoteing me on my own video
How did he get wood to make the chest ?
I like your house
11:36 SUS MOMENT
"Don't get me wrong, I still love reading comments it's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me." HAHAHA Classic Luke! 25:08
God Loves You All❤❤✝️
The statue looks like the guy that failed art school în 1910's
if there is a clear block between you and the crystal, smack it.
but there's no day and night in the end so how is it 100 days
14:23 true what i lack in life to make up for by having infinite space (and a few lesser gods stuck in there lol)
15:10, heyyy uhhhh, w h a t s   t h a t ?
Please 200 days
The comment below me is not notable

“BRO WHERE’D HE GET THE TORCH? HE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THE TORCH?! HE WENT IN CREATIVE I SÆW” - LTN
You could’ve gone to the nether and get the wood there by going to the red forest Bruh
iif you looted the full ender city you would get a crafting table !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
People thinking their the funniest thing quoting Luke say "There you are quoting me now"
It already takes me 100 real life days to find an end city by itself 💀
Just sounds funny that with this challenge you can get an elytra before you even get wood
25:20 looks like a chorus worm
How did you get item frames         How did you get item frames
I think he got the torch from the end portal, since they spawn at the top.
no offence  but this 40+ hours wasted
But really, how did he get the torch?-
Watching this makes me realize the End needs an update just like the Nether did. Biomes, crafting options, more food opinions, make it fully livable from nothing
“Quoting me. In the comment section. On my own video.”
😂 this is amazing
He did some mining but no crafting in Minecraft
i just think that 100 days in the end is pretty interesting, great vid btw
You're really good at Minecraft
I wish they would make a huge end update
27:40 how you get ladders he’s definitely cheating-🤓
I didn't know you can make a chorus fruit farm
Hoe did you get the torch tho?
“So this is how I’m gonna use those end rods.”  *cuts to piston and end rod contraption*
do 200 days of Minecraft End
Day:your mom😂
“Ender balls” 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Just four pieces of wood could have changed everything
Where did you get the torch
I was waiting for him to go back to the Overworld and he never did 😢

Out of all of the sword words he didn’t say stab
"Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me" - LTN 2021
Ender ba
You can make a shulcer box with chest
I did this, but before i went back to survival, i gave myself a crafting table. mostly for shulker boxes, as you can't make tools, but you can make hoppers for simple enderman farms, anvils for combining tools, and armor, but the armor in the cities is much better.
I might try this
You’re doing it you’re posting in the comments right now
do 100 days on diamond superflat or 100 days of getting as rich as possible
heaven does exist.
man, that's a lot of Swiss cheese
He almost died because he forgot to put on his Elantra ready to just fly around his new home and almost crashed into death
Please consider helping Luke reach 4.2m subscri...... Oh wait
Love the videos but heaven does exist
To all my fellow blind people watching this 👍🏽✌🏽👍🏽🤝🏽🤘🏽👏🏽🙌🏽👍🏽👏🏽✌🏽👍🏽✌🏽🙌🏽👍🏽
13:30 no one knows about it😭 it's probably the most useful feature in the game
U R Kool
“A wall is what make a real home” a future Ltn quote
Punch kick lick slug slap suck icy BAHAHAHAHA😂 I died when he kept saying that 😂
Do 100 days no cuts
Here's a tip for a video like this maybe in the future Every Minecraft day is 20 minutes
ha, he calls diamonds "worthless" (bc they are)
This is just ohio
what is the torches actul thing like what
Hey LTN how about you do 100 minecraft bedrock edition
quake pro or 120 fov if u fps gotta say it's the worst thing to use in fps games
Does that mean you can give me a free mcdonels
yea ik that diamonds in the end with no craft table is use less i mean how you gonna make armor or sword soo chest is ur only hope
100 days in the Boston Commonwealth. Fallout 4
LLLLLLLLLLLL
the tip for fixing gear is only good for un-enchanted gear. if it is enchanted itll lose the effect
Wait you can make purpur slabs... right?
22:15 wha-? It didn't teleport u?
Luke “I finally got my first Placable block” His hotbar: has a block
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉
How did he get item frames tho
Warden?
did anyone else notice that at 22:17 he ate a chorus fruit and he did not teleport?
susiy
16:37 his voice is so soft and sweet here I had a heart attack
Luke: "beating the dragon with nothing is impossible" Camman18: " *OBJECTION* "
Luke can make houses look good no matter how limited he is rather me in creative and I still can’t make a nice house and I’ve been playing for 6 years
"Do you see it? Yep. They're doing it right now. Quoting me. In the comment section. On my own video." - Luke (Notable)
This guy has a LOT of replacement words for attack
This is probably my least favorite 100 days. Not bad, just uninteresting
I'd like to see Luke try to do this again but with 1 change. Give yourself a crafting table. I feel like that alone can open up so many possibilities.
I subscribed this is the best person for challenges here's a challenge 100 days in the bottom of the world good work on this one and see if you can beat my challage!!!😺😺
Drives me crazy that you cant craft LOL
Luke:where I can put some useless items like diamonds Everyone else:MINING INTENSELY FOR DAYS TO GET A SINGLE DIAMOND
The chests are low-key more valuable than the items inside
'oh- oh shit my mic is on"
21:15 that sound was crazy
I don't see anyone else making this suggestion, but what if you allowed yourself just one day on the overworld to gather as many resources as you could and then return to the end? Sure there wouldn't be much of an end goal, but could be interesting to see what you could make with just a day of resources in the end.
Just fyi he got the torch from the middle of the dragon island, so no he did not cheat!
Your a legend for this. I'm about to go the end for the first time. I thought there would've been wood in the end cities
11:36
This man is at the next levellll brotherr🤲🏼
I love how you literally laid siege to the dragon
5:13 rhyme
We’re did you get ladders
”Most of you are unoriginal and just quote me… in my own video” 😅😂 had me dying
An aether mod version would be sick
I want tors face reveal
beginning in the end. k.
11:35
Because I am joking because can not escape with a bed under an enderportal
If you  put a bed a on under an Ender portal and you die you will repack to end again you can escape with a bed under
26:26 from island where is the ender dragon  and on that bedrock is 4 torchs.
Someone turn the moon into chunks. They called it the "end" just to make an excuse for destroying the moon
yes you are correct on that also i like your minecraft skin
One sub and like
I LOVE IT
Luke you sound just like one of my old teachers
"Ender balls"
Among us
Luke: my first placeable block, END RODS!  Chorus flower: Am I nothing to you?
17:58
why not steal slabs from end cities and use them for floor, pretty sure endermen cannot teleport on those.  edit: nvm.
the thumbnail is so funny
I typed doing this I got to day 97 and I died 😭😭😭😭😭😭
“Most of us are pretty unoriginal and just quote me”. How insulting I would never do that…
Never mind
On day 92 he had iron bars how?
I don't know how you did this. I tried playing end only with trees, some seeds, and dirt. Even then it was super hard.
We have just found out that Luke is not a Christian
Lifeless void doodoodoodo Lifeless void doodoodoodo - luke thenotable
the end won't get updated till 7088 when the world ends
'Heaven doesn’t exsist' not my words just his lol
How can you live in 100 days in the end there is like nothing to do…
Hahaha among us
13:20
27:28 "can you guess what it is?" me, internally: it's a meth lab  "it's a chorus fruit farm!" me: oh
I wanna know how you got the torch now
"It's not that I don't like reading comments, it's that most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me"
how did you get the torch though?
Lmao
This is like the first real 100 days films which are real
“Look at them, quoting me, on my own video.” -Luke TheNotable
As soon I I saw this video I thought he died in his hardcore world ; )
amongus
11:36 headphone warning 💀
Technically you could use ender pearls to teleport to the pillars and break them then enderpearl to other pillars and break them then pearl clutch down and kill the ender dragon with your fist
15:59 1.20 be like in 10 years
I would have done some “off camera mining” and give myself wood in creative
“Don’t get me wrong, I love reading comments, but most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me int he comments.” -Luke TheNotable, 2021
… bruh don’t be saying heaven is not real don’t even talk about stuff like that
Lifeless void do do do do do do lifeless void do do do do do do
Okay that made me laugh, "what helps when i try do do crazy challenges in Minecraft is that i remember this game is for children"
"starting at the ender dragon fight with literally nothing might actually be impossible" Camman18:
if you get boosted by the dragon you can break a crystal if you land close enough
POV: your looking for a comment that contains the word infant because Luke said something about his infant child
Heaven exists
No matter what challenges Luke has in Minecraft,  He will find a way to survive and stun the world. 🤩
Me what if he dies how will he he back realises hardcore
You sound like Brandon Rogers ❤️
id make a cute hose
id make a hose
You are a nice person man
What it comes out of course
Luke the insaneable
Nice design on the floor and house.
You should make a 100 days in the aether! It would be a change due to the mods, but with your commentary it would overall probably make a good video!
23:34
This was very notable
Luke on day 20 : Now I have a place to put my worthless items. Me : Gets    1 diamond by day 100
Omg this video is spook good😍😍😍😛😅😰😒😌😭😔😚😖😤😰😞😜😌😌😞😞😞😰😰😪😭😁😁😀☺😜😒😥😒😝😉😝😝😉😉😌😁
It's odd the service down at the shore is. I got 4 bars of internet helped me watch this.
Bottom slabs, they don't let things spawn right? What if you use it for the floor and the endermen can't come visit unannounced?  Higher roof!
"...my more worthless items like diamonds" that killed me
Do it in the deep dark
HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING MY MUM
Now I wanna try this
Wow
Love the good work keep it going 😊
Love 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
25:11 "It's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me."
End island are just peace
Yep I see it there doing it right now quoting me in my own video
2:58 day ur mom
Tried this (spawning near an end city though) and died within two minutes so I didn’t put it up on my channel.
Afk
Ez
you...didn't hit the ender dragon's head? bruh. That's why you couldn't damage the ender dragon, because melee hits don't affect her body, only her head. Why haven't I seen ANY comment talking about this??
He could have gotten the torch from when he killed the dragon that can give you 4 from the portal it even gives u  A EGG!!!!! 😃🥚
YOU ARE CHEATING BECAUSE WHEN YOU ONCE WHEN YOU WERE GOING BACK HOME FROM THE MIAN END ISLAND YOU ATE CHORUS FRIUT AND DIDNT TELEPORT IM UNSUBBING
“-and their children- will be horribly disabled from all the inbreeding.” I am DYING laughing-
“my children will my end stone miners and their children will be endstone miners and their children will be endstone miners and their children will be horribly disabled from all the inbreeding” LMFAOO
11:36 🤨🤨🤨🤨
“Cheating on day one”  And now there’s gonna be a 100 days cheats
Ain't this what MatPat said happened to the Ancient Civilization of Builders?
I'm wondering why he put that there at 3:00 in da vid
"and there children will be *horribly disabled from all the imbreading* "
"what I was doing with my other hand" Huh.
It is possible to beat the elder dragon in hardcore mode with nothing but it will take a while, here are the steps:  1) Make sure you spawn in a box rather than the obsidian pillar outside of the end island (so you can break out of the box) [Alternatively, if you do spawn on a pillar outside the end island, anger an enderman, let it teleport to you and kill it so you can teleport to the end island  2)Next, make yourself to the obsidian pillars which hold the end crystals and break the obsidian to make a staircase to the top (this is the bit which takes the longest) - also make sure you don’t get hit with dragons breath  3)After that, punch the end crystals  4)Then, repeat the last two steps for all the pillars (Alternatively you could also get ender pearls before making the staircase and pearl to the other obsidian pillars to break the end crystals)  5)Then wait for the dragon to perch and keep punching it until it dies
why acnt you make shulker box
day 6876656765545678 i found another end city except i forgor ender chest💀
I gained brained cells watching this man mine, and I dont know why
Why does he have hardcore hearts after changing to survival
"Yeah see it? Yup, their doing it right now.Quoting' me. In the comment section. On my own video."
Here's a good joke Here, I am mining my own business.
I love the nische little comments/ noises that you make that the listener really has to be paying full attention for to hear.
That is a very good floor
alternate title: luke being the most happy in his life about a pickaxe
heres an interesting idea 100 days without mining
the torch
bro he changed the thumbnail
A M O N G U S
8:58 me hereing him say he's pretty full on loot made me go MAKE SHULKER BOXES! YOU HAVE THE INGREDIENTS!  "me forgetting he can't craft shulker boxes without a crafting table which he DOES NOT HAVE"
"Lifeless void doo doo doo doo doo doo"  Dude I'm dying
Wait didn't he get the torch from the bedrock fountain in the end
Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me- LUKE! Yeah…
this would probably be a lot cooler with a few end expansion mods. stuff that makes the end feel more like a whole dimension instead of basically an arena
This game is for children 03:21
I tried on bedrock this challenge and died  but I'm planning
The enderman was like what is thisnguy doing i dont know what he is doing but im going away7:54
I always forget where I came from and when through in a end coty
The sound effects would trigger ptsd to any veteran
Dont eat Chorus too much bc if u eat it too much in ages u will be transform into a enderman
this video was so good i started to  do the same thing
10:41
I actually tried this and I'm doing very good for myself
Yes you're right and iron helmet with protection for is better than a diamond helmet It's literally better than netheright helmet!!!
My favourite part of the video was when he said  "Yeah you see it, yup, you're doing it right now, quote me, in the comment section, on my own video"

"That was not a notable move" Luke thenoteable                                                                     -----------------

In 16:46 luke cursed don’t believe me slow it down
Luke can mine but not craft so it's called Minenotcraft 😂😂😂😂
14:22 NO DONT SONG IT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THATS NOT NOTABLE OF YOU
this is exactly why the end needs a major update
a true bop   lifelessss void doo doo lifeless void doo doo :(
3:28 bro your first place able blocks are the chorus fruits..
you could use the obisdian to make a nether portal to get wood
Why didn't he use shulker boxes he could get them
You know that end crystals only do leg damage
Hey just wanted to say I think your ender house is the nicest house you've built
I tried this and died instantly to shulkers upon entering an end city
no it not
So there’s a mod called ‘better end,’ and doing a playthrough like this with that mod would be super fun!
The dragon fight took so long because swords only work on its head/neck
4:50 i think he died
You know that you’re not playing normal minecraft when diamonds have no use to you
The end seriously needs an update
you can find saplings in end city's
most Minecraft players when they get armor with the best enchants in the game expect for mending: USELESS!11
Guys 3 steps away from becoming an enderman
Down below
i always thought he was in hardcore till this video, i wonder why he has that texture pack on
Can you make 200 days in the end please
I'm trying this challenge except with some items, like lava and water, wood, dirt and saplins, and one single arrow, there's no way to get arrows in the end, that makes me appreciate more the overworld.
Im not mad but he has iron a gold he can make a iron door a gold Pressure plate
Wasn't his first placeable block the courhrus fruit block.
11:34 among gus🗿
Is that game cursed i saw a cross
You can use an Ender Pearl to tp to one of the caged crystals and break it. Then if you collect iron bars, you need to use a version dupe glitch and end up with around 15 stacks of bars, then you need to build a bridge like 2000 Blocks and get to the end cities
Where did he get the trapdoors at 25:335
"Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just qoute me" -lukethenotable
I don't like the floor, I love it!!
Go to 17:54
25:04 I like it
whats a purpur block
Maybe, just maybe, the ender man are all people who tried to survive in the end but went crazy and dying in the end maybe mutates your body and makes you an ender man?
11:35 why just why
I'm doing this challenge while watching u do it
...     ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...
Liked the "Lifeless void" song
18:20 when falling towards the void at Mach 81 is just inconvenient

"Ehhhh there's not really any good joke- oh- shit my mic is on" - Luke TheNotable
He died a lot
10:44 luke sayn the forbidden riff
Wait, you have kids?
7:21
I have been questioning, when I first saw the thumbnail, I thought the enderman had a Mustache! XD
16:44 yoooo first time I’ve heard him swear
if i am correct you are a men there for you see no problem with your base 10:08
i love it!
11:36
9:30
14:55 "why do these end city have beet seeds in the chests?" Beet seeds were added in update 0.8, however, you had to travel long distances into unloaded chunks at a time were horses didn't exist just to find the seeds, so when the ender update came out (version 1.0) they added beet seeds to the end city chests so that players could more easily find them
"I'm slightly less vulnerable now, but I'm still useless."   Me after a therapist visit...
I feel like the real challenge with living for 100 days in the End is not going insane. With nothing to do or make with, it looks so depressing. And the dark atmosphere adds to the dark mood of it. Only one food source, two light sources, basic blocks (pupur, chorus plant and endstone), two mobs (minus the dragon), and so many useless materials.
“Try this one.” Me and my friends are doing the nether one. We’ll do this one next!
Heaven doesn’t exist or the stairway to it?
I like how Luke sometimes talks like Xavier Renegade Angel

how did he get the torch tho
11:36 best moment of my life
200
Loook a torrcchhkh fake dislike this is fake
They should add tin to the end so you could make bronze
You could’ve made shulker boxes- I think it’s possible without a crafting table...
1 year anniversary
17:49 💀
or you could play only on one biome
Why do you like hardcore?
How did he get the torch doe??
Just so people know he got the torch from where the bedrock is
Pls do 200 days in the end
11:36 AMOGUS
You could’ve gone to the nether by building a portal shape then use the fire from the end crystal
How do you count the days if the sky does not change? Really notable content!
you are insane!! keep up the OUTSTANDING work!
when you are hitting the dragon hit it under its head and dont jump
Do it again but use the better end mod
I thought this was hardcore…  but you kept respawning, you used a texture pack to try and fool us to make it seem like you great at the game  😡
I could never do this 6:36
The ender balls are kinda sus😳

He got the Torch from the bedrock thingy
2:22 right hook upper cut jab hondo rush bear hug dreamland expres (all of those are punch out moves by the way)
You were not the 1st one cause I didn't before you
how did he get the torch
“ And their children will be *horribly disabled from all the inbreeding.* “
he should've repurposed a end city for his house
Does he know not how to make a shulkerbox literally a chest and two shards which he has both of
You should have spawned in a crafting table
You sound like a golden retriever if a golden retriever could talk.

Who else thinks he should do 100 days in hypixel skyblock
But how did he get the torch
Fun fact, you can u watch videos by removing them from watch histories, meaning that no one benefits from watching the video
it is actually possible to kill the dragon with nothing, you just have to be reallllllllllly good at throwing pearls, and punching a dragon when its on a piller
subed
you are SO INSPIRING, i really want to play on your server, But i can't cause i am on bedrock, have parental controls on my switch and, i dont have a true account on my switch
I was building an end base in creative while listening to this
its driving me mad that he never crafted shulker boxes
"They're doing out right now. Quoting me in the comment section on my own video." -Luke the Notable
he missed an end city at the partcwhere hevwas saying video game references
Luke managed to make a better looking house in the end than mine in the normal world…
How did he get the torch
I'm already stressed just by trying to get an elytra or going to the end islands without atleast 5 shulker boxes (exaggeration, 1 shulkerbox max)  But living in the end? Nope never. I'd rather play superflat no structures or nether only.
I like the floor design luke

Most of u are pretty unoriginal and just quote me - Luke the notable
"yup, your doing it, your quoting me, on my own video"  Luke TheNoatable - 2021
How did he get ladders
I think prot 4 iron is more or less equivalent to diamond, but diamond has higher durability and also higher toughness, meaning less damage from stronger attacks like the dragon or endermen, so i'd still take the diamond
Those ender pearls looked like there enchanted
Luke: AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE ENDSTONE MINERS. And their children will be horribly disabled. Me: am I their child???
Actually u can beat the dragon with nothing. U have to use something where u leave then game then join back and use the few seconds of immunity
Was the torch in the end City
I like I like I like
Can confirm, protection 4 iron is better than diamond :) Prot 3 iron is EQUAL to diamond.
Hllo
did the thumbnail change??
Luke says his inventory is full me: SHULKERS!!!
Actually you can beat the dragon. Kill endermen for enderpearls. Next you want to use the pearls to take out the crystals. Than slap the dragon to death
11:36 Is SUS
*unwatches video*
5:16
2:22 2:30
Play with your family but the twist is that you will play in the sky
You need to live 100 days underwater now
For those who don't know apathy means lack of interest
btw you could have towered up to the crystals and blew them up to create a fire then place down a chest and built a quick nether portal to get more progress
could you craft anvil with iron you had and use diamonds to repair a pickaxe...?
your black shirt is creepy
i feel like this challenge would be much more interesting with a crafting table, if you continue this to 200 days i would definitely support you cheating one in
18:20 hey luke I'd like to buy your nft, how much will it be?
"They're doing, it, quoting me in the comment section, on my own video"
@17:55 dear lord that just took a VERY dark turn VERY quickly that I had to go out of fullscreen mode just to check the title of the video and confirm this LTN's video and not something else o.o;;
“How many failed trademarks do you have? Cuz I got two.” Best quote I have heard from Luke so far
Your 2000 days world is really good I know I can't build anything that you built I'm there
Once carved out an entire dong in the end, it went all the way down to the void. fun times
_"Yup there doing it right now, quoting me, in the comment section, on my own video"_

Luke i'm a big fan of you.
Remember stay notable
I like your flor
How did he get the ladders?
"i survived 100 days in the end." "i survived 100 days in hardcore minecraft."  next thing you know he's gonna post videos like: "i survived 15,283 days in a post-apocalyptic world."
Do 200 days pls
Who else is screaming for him to make shulker boxes
Okay, but how DID he get that torch?

Day 69
Why do u have Alex skin
Why do I feel that luke would kick a baby for some dirt a hoe and a sapling
why is his end house better than all of my houses💀
why didn't u made shulker boxes?
What if you got ender pearls, then break the crystals, then punch the ender dragon
To anyone! The best place to mine is -58 and when you find diamonds mine on a direct straight line from the diamonds on coordinate. (Ex: positive x) if you don't find any diamonds in the next hundred blocks then you need to go FROM THE DIAMONDS on the (Ex: z coordinate) and you should find some. (it doesn't matter if it's Positive or Negative). I did this and in about 15 - 30 mins I got about 2 stacks. I would recommend a few stacks of torches, eff 3, 4, 5, unbreaking, 1, 2, 3 and a fortune 3 pick. Caves work but in the new update if diamonds spawn next to "Cave Air" they are most likely to be 1-3 veins, while in strip mining it tends to be 4-8 veins.
Why did I watch this twice
The opposite of an enderman is a starterwoman
Love you luke thanks
"Yeah see it, their doing it right now, just quoting me." -Luke theNotable"
howd he go in creative during hardcore mode
I like ur house
Dude I can't belive you made it you must be a real minecraft pro!
You sure that was 20 hundred days
Btw how do you know the day had ended😐
I like how most of the video is him complaining about the end.
10:08  I don't se... oh I see what you mean uhhh, great videos keep it up
Sed pls
Have you ever heard of diamond blocks gold blocks iron blocks yeah those things exist and could probably beef up your house
@lukethenotable you shouldve mined the chest and make shulkers xD
Luke’s just roasting the overworld every couple minutes
love the design
11:35 i don’t understand
how did u get cheats in hardcore i cant
I have tried this...i have bedrock. The endermen keep teleporting away when I hit them. Plus to top it all off, if they dont hit you or you dont look in their eyes for long enough, they stop being aggro. ;-;
i dont like it
Can you do a 5000 day
the notable asmr "among us" was quite nice
actually it is possible to beat minecraft without picking anything up soooo it is possible
Use chulker box
I watched you when I was 6 now I'm eight how
Why is nobody talking about how he just starts saying onomatopoeias when he kill endermen
14:18-that cave sound hit the mark on the topic so perfectly well timed!! 😥
Where *did* the torch come from, though?
Why didint you did a shulker box?
“Quoting me. In the comments section. On my own video!”
I don’t like it
"yep, i see it, their doing it right now, quoting me."        yoy
I would just like to say that Minecraft isn’t a kids game, just often marketed to them.
Wy doe’s LITERALLY EVERY YOUTUBER kill endermens
How do we know if there is day or night in the end
this is the first video of yours ive seen. you are incredibly funny and i cant wait to binge the rest of your content!
How did you get a torch pls tell me
nope
I did this before you
You should have used slabs for the floor then you could of had a full block cause I’m pretty sure endermen don’t spawn on slabs
is there any 100 days challange this guy has not done?!?!?!
14:14 the timing of the ambience is the best part of this clip
Luke : finally placable blocks(talking to end rods) Chorus fruit:   :(
Fyi, a protection 4 gold helmet is better than a protection 1 diamond helmet.
WHY DON'T I WATCH MORE OF YOUR VIDEOS??
You described your chorus farm like I describe my exe's. Love your channel but then again its yours and no one can tell you what to do with it....
“Yep they’re doing it right now. Quoting me. In the comments section. On my own video” -Luke TheNotable
LTN: I was in the back flipping burgers. I still have burns on my forearms  Me: *looks at burn on forearm from exact same thing*
CHEESY
Oddly enough watching someone survive 100 days in the end reminds me of what I think it would be like living in a liminal space
Stop making cringe jokes
This man knows his viewers well
wow..
11:33 Luke you were the notable one!
You can make a door and pressure plate using the iron
Why no shulker boxes
In hardcore minecraft, curse of vanishing doesn't matter.
Do the endurance thing and get perls to break crystalls And umm for shows how many days you have been in the world
Luke : “yup your quoting me in the comments” me who already posted a comment quoting him 💀
“Anyone can do these challenges” me: doing all three nether cave and end challenges in a week
He died? 3:01
Anyone else think Luke should do 100 days in the old skyblock map?
Wow I didn’t quote a quote
This seems like the embodiment of pain.
I really like your new floor
11:34 *_A M O G U S_*
how did u get the torch fr
I hope you know Jesus loves you.
When he said stairway to Heaven wait that doesn’t exist I was like BOYYYY YOU MESSED UP SONN
BRO YOU GOTTA MAKE SHULKER BOXES
lol where DID he get the torch
"I still love reading comments, it's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me"
Heaven does exist well atleast not in Minecraft but it does exist in real life
Cordinetes 1000.5 100.0 100.5
This fight took so long I made agriculture
12:21
5:58 This is a reminder of where i am i need to come back
POV: you’re looking in the comments to see people quote Luke.
How Matpats Enderman theory works
Luke: AMONG US   me: pure gold
How did you get the torch?
He thought of quite the amount of ways to say hit
It’s technically possible to beat the ended dragon with just a water bucket
He pokes fun at himself and his failures/mistakes so beautifully
You can’t call at Minecraft because you can’t craft
😁
He could be on day 97 not day 100 and end it xD
When luke said heaven doesn't exist in the end😭😭😂😂👌🏾..... It only exists in the overworld🙂
Comment in my comment if u like it
Guard:“What’s ur name” Luke:”Luke” Guard:”what do u have in ur bag” Luke:uumh let see I have.....” Guard:”sir what’s wrong”  Luke:”I left my minecraft pick at home”  Guard:”we got another one” *police go to his home to get his pick*   Guard:”sir I believe this belongs to u” Luke:”thank u so much I was going to jump into the void if ya didn’t get it”    Luke:”And i also left my sword at home”    Guard:”........... yeah I  quit”  By: jebreil to:Luke
Me when I survive on there 💀
[End = more harder] then nether & overworld IF you surviving on END
Luke:  No Cheats  Luke 5 seconds later: Creative, tp, survival
It bothers me how Luke could have literally saved hours of time trying to reach the enderdragon by just taking one of those small portals to the main island  And he could have ended the dragon fight in way less time if he just attacked the head...
I like your house
Doom Slayer after beeing asked about his motivations: 1:31
Fun Fact: u CAN beat without ANY items using the dragons knockback to launch on pillars
Luke the notable said shit at 16:45 or 16:43 or 16:44
"Most of you guys are pretty unoriginal and just quote me."
Horrible speedrun
I year later he is a full on enderman
Where those laddars come from?
The first play through was day ur mom THATS MEAN
Ya'll wonder what happended to the 3000 days?
lol i killed the ender dragon with my fist!
You can craft end brics of end Stones
Why don’t you make shulcker boxes
7:01
You should do a 200 days but give yourself a single crafting table
Destroy dragon with fist and crystals with ender pearls
I love it
SUPER DUM but good good job
GOD bless you all 🙏 for HE Loves you all 🙏
Height limit for building is 256 blocks
Fact that he can kill the dragon on day 56 but he just go building
How did he get the torch dough
Luke: *talks about an end rod* “My first placeable block!” Chorus Flower Block *that is very much placeable* : “ *Am I a joke to you?* “
"Luckily, I got lucky!"  Good talk, Luke
😂Oh shit my mic’s on
Mmmmmm?
POV: U are triggered while thinking why isn't he making shulker boxes.
bro- such a champ... the end? N o one would have thought of this- this must have been- like- so stressfull
The torch came from when he beat the ender dragon because near the egg there are four torches.
Do you have children
Luke was sus sooooo many times this video
Is it me or the monument looked like Hitler?
Go to the nether
In your house how did you get ladders... You said you couldn't on the ender dragon island but your mine...
Heaven does exist you're just too blind to see it

youer bum
Why did Lin curse
Ok
Idk if it matters, but this gives me good info about a charater I'm making
It's a shame you couldn't craft shulker boxes
Luke : crappy things like diamonds Me:WTF
do u know how to change skins 🤔🤔🤔 I did 😏
"they are doing it right now in the comments" Luke TheNotable folks
you make houses way better than me even in the end, nether and overworld  god i need to train
26:40 monument to Adolf Hitler.
I don't know why you didn't craft shulker box
That pro file looks so much like my uncle
late at night once a guy on my server started in the end and he tried k*lling the dragon and with nothing, i only saw 10 minutes of it before i had to go, the next morning the dragon was dead and there was a bridge to the gateway, i text him up and he said he did it and came on and all he had on him was end city loot and he had never been anywhere else other than the end, but im 99% certain that he either hacked, because there are suspicions that he hacks on a smp me and him are in, and it could also be that he just stayed up super late because he is sleep deprived, i dont just mean normal sleep deprived, i mean waking me up at 3 am because he decided to relog from the smp which pinged my discord
Oh I now how he got the torch
On 3:10 There Is A End GateWay Near The Chorus Tree I Don't Know Its Name So If You Know Tell Me
"Yep, that's it. You're doing it right now. Quoting me. In the comment section. Of my own video" - LukeTheNotable (2021)
He could have took the chest in the endcitys to build a shulkerbox????? Did he forget that even tho he used to storage stuff in his home?
Him: you can't see the rest of the footage cuz I'm selling it as a nft Me: a natural flow test?
But in the End it doesnt even matter!
If you want ore's and trees in the End just download a mod that adds those things
hi my name is sarah and i love your video your super cool i will sub and like ok bye
You're not notable You're questionable @Luke TheNotable

“And that’s why I do it with my ender balls.” -LTN -LTN being suspicious
I already have no brain cells to loose
Try this on Minecraft Xbox 360 edition there is no end islands only the ender dragon island no loot except ender pearls
Luke: I’m a end stone miner and my kids will be end stone miners and there kids will be end stone miners and there kid’s will be end stone miners and…  Me: Ok this is going on forever   And as I said that he stopped 🤣🤦🏽‍♀️
Thank you so much for starting the 100 day trend
1:39 this gave me ptsd
im subscibe
omg
OMG
An NFT joke in summer 2021? Dang
He has shulkers and chest in the same area and he makes the decision to not craft a shulker box
It’s also as nutritious as gas station food 😂
Luke: “what I wanna know is why these end cities have so many chests with beet root seeds in them. There’s no dirt. THEY JUST MOCK ME 😤” **takes them anyways**
"in the end, there's always the end" -some random guy
3:14 um??? what's going on  with the gateway
-20:37 you could have taken the ladders and used those to reuse the end stone pillars for flying.
17:07 lol yep some good memes pg 14 if you know what I mean
🎵Never gonna give you up never gonna let you dowwn 🎵
Minecraft is the best
17:00 LMAO
10:11 emmmm how did you get item frames you need sticks and there is no wood in the end
Do you have a child?
Well sh**. I was playing minecraft in the end, (like u are, thanks) and I found a chest plate. I DIDNT READ THE ENCHANTMENTS. Note to self: read enchantments, or they might have curse of binding on.  Update: I died, returned to the over world, and tossed it into Lava. Than went back to the end.
I dont like it      I love it😂
Minecraft needs to make an end update soon.
“bif” -Luke TheNotable
I like cheese
New song Minecraft in real life sus sus
I have never heard of someone so happy to mine 😂
100 years later “100 days -[monster spawner]
Next 100 days in Minecraft Roblox
i was thinking it would be possible to tower with half of the blocks being (light or heavy) weighted pressure plates as they can be crafted in the grid, not only am i not sure if they can be placed on chests end rods OR ladders, but also pearl be better.
boring
People: what did you do on day 12?   Luke: i found an elaytra!!✨✨
I'm disappointed, you can kill the dragon with nothing, you need to kill endermen pearl to each pillar, blow them up and slowly beat the dragon to death when he perches
hey luke im a small youtuber and if you can somehow get me to 300 subs then ill do this challenge and try to edit it
Can we just talk about the aggression over the torch whoever he was arguing with in his head..must feel hurt lmao
poggers
can you do 100 days in slime rancher it even counts how many days you have done
actually, it’s te finally possible to beat the ender dragon Island without any tools, etc. it will just take an extremely long time, you have to break obsidian blocks to get to the crystals and then break them, once they are all broken, you just have to constantly punch the dragon when it’s in the middle and then once it’s dead, you have to kill a few Ende and and teleport through the little teleporting thing (forgot he name)
Not to heaven that doesnt exist? Kinda sus
Didn't realize how dark he is
I think I know how you'd kill the ender dragon
shoulda hopped through the portal
Enderballs
This was a good idea so for your 3000 days you’d have good knowledge on the End
the black notable shirt looks terrifying 😭
PLSS DO 3000 DAYS
Play roblox bed wars Luke I am free kit now
but where did he get the torch
“Yep, you’re doing it right now, quoting me” -Luke the notable
I just got called an overworld normie
“who needs to mine when u can ✨kill✨”  i totally agree
How do you do 190 days, in the End, there are no days
16:17 Ahhhhhh, remember the days when the build limit was so low.
you really need an intro
“My inventory is looking a little sus AMOUNG US” -Luke TheNotable
you sound like 27 even tho your 17, how do u have a baby tho remember whne u said you baby took a sht or smth
Welcome to hell for being a aythyiest
Matpat: They didn’t have much to work with; only ugly yellows and purples.  LTN: *laughs in creativity*
Why didnt you use the obsidian for a nether portal
I love you bro I just do
3:14 he found the way back to the ender dragon
I thought that "the end" was the end of the 100 days
Luke:*gets the first end block from a chorus fruit* Luke again:*gets end rod and makes it it's first placeable block* Brain processing it will take a while and youll loose brain sells  This is why I love watching Luke play Minecraft 😂♥️
20:29 - 20:42 how did an entire day passed when you joined the other world??
Dude do 100 drops on the new among us update
at the beginning u can go to end city place without killing e drag using pearls
10:42. That's cap 🙏
Did you make any shulker boxes?
He said a bad word
11:33 Luke TheNotable: "Still got a lot of loot in there, my inventory's already looking pretty sus, AMOGUS!"
so cool
E
Not really I frequent using the mini crafting table cause it’s good in the beginning after raids or removing a curse
Luke Heaven is real and so is Jesus and he can save you and give you everlasting life with him
I avoided watching this for a while because i thought the video was gonna be boring but it's not
"Yup they're quoting me right now. In the comments of my own video"- Luke the notable 2021
Luke: FORGET THE WINGS I CAN MINE!
lol spelling
lifeles void do do do
Like the notable when mojang ads a new dimension : ah pain and suffering for eternety my favourite feeling
The chest is made of wood... There's no wood in the end... Edit: nvm
Why wouldn’t you get the iron chest plate because it had curse of vanishing that’s not even really a bad curse
He said diamonds were useless OH MY GOD
Nice merch man
Did anyone else feel weird when he called diamonds worthless (like for yes dislike for no)?
He could’ve used a pickaxe to pick up the chest and he could’ve made a sholker box and that would’ve fixed his storage problem
Loved the floor design.
Why is his voice so soothing, but also so funny
HOW DID U GET ITEM FRAMES THERES NO LEATHER IN THE END
i’m pretty sure everyone who didn’t know what apathy meant looked it up when luke said it
You could have took the chest and make wooden planks
Man rlly said nft
I wish minecraft add trees and stufff in the end
you shoulve made some shulker next time
How enderman are born. Nom Nom Nom
BRUH DIS STUFF BUSSIN also Ford F1FITTY
The fact he respawned, twice in the first 3 minutes, in a hardcore world
LUKE! I subscribed to the end
HAX!
Continue this series but you stay in the overworld.
sometimes when i'm stressing about life, i think about this video and i think, if luke manages to survive 100 days in the minecraft end in survival, i can manage my life somehow too
this my worst nightmare its like being stuck in the backroom
he died in hardcore how he can still play
Do a 100 days in the end with a crafting table
i love your end house
I think you should know this is fake since chorus fruit teleports you to the ground but he says he gets Lucky with chorus S
How to beat Minecraft with only the End, at just the dragon island  Punch endstone for 12 years until you make it to the surface  Step 2: Punch obsidian for 15 years, and go decade-and-a-half by decade-and-a-half without taking damage from the dragon or endermen or the breath Step 3: Break all the crystals by being behind a lower block Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until all crystals are gone Punch the dragon to 0 hp without getting hit by it.  Good luck!  Also sheesh just give yourself a single block of Dirt and a Sapling already
Only if you could turn chests into wood 😔
I hate it
Do not like his floor!CREEPY VIBES
you should join hermitcraft
2:10 make a  video of you showing all the endermen you murdered
your house is so cool (; :)
Wait HOW DID U MAKE GLASS U NEED SAND
On day 4 I see a end city                 Decree referee exceeded addressed referee e e E  E E e E  eE E E we e E d e d D E dd  D d d e D D  we're e e E E E E  e e e e e e e e e E e e E E E  e E e e e e
I was more interested in the thumbnail than the video
11:36 made me laugh so hard
disgusitng --
im insane
You know, the house looks pretty good considering the limited materials.
gud
wait till he finds about shulker boxes
heaven doesn't exist just like joe mama
DISABLED DUE TO THE INBREEDING 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
You can actually use the iron to make an iron door and some iron pressure plates to go the with the door and boom you have a door so you can call it home // I only watched till 25:00 so idk what’s gonna come next
Where did the torch come from sir
How’d he get the torch? that question… it will never be answered
AMOGUS
Just make chorus fruit blocks
how do he get ladders?
The nether is goateed tho
The end is impossible unless you went to the end islands
if u read this comment, im original and i dont quote ._.
you could try 100 days underground.... cant go to the surface!
How do you do the most damage is on the head
No but seriously how did he get the torch
If you ask me, this highlights the problems with the end. You HAVE to fight the dragon first (if playing without cheats), there's no equialivent to wood, so if you lose your stuff, you're stuck. Everything looks the same, no biomes like the nether. It's also made of only one block, so there's no variety of building blocks.
How did you get the chests
so how did he get the torch?
You amazing
The torch is from the end portal😎
“Look they’re quoting me right now” Luke the notable
I like it
SUS AND STOP POSTING ABOUT AMONG USSSS
"Yep, they're doing it right now. quoting me. In the comment section." x"7'35(3;95@/"3
That's why they call him Luke The No-Table
Shulker boxes shulker boxes shulker boxes
That Enderman is telling a story about his dimension
I like your video
A Minecraft day is 10 irl minutes
Kind of sus with your Ender balls out
A m o n g u s
...
Noooooob
I love your floor
14:24 oh you know the usual luke just giving you PTSD about the lifeless void blow
How many times he listened "the end' by C418?
Why didn’t he take the chest to make shulker boxes
"I'd kill a baby villager for a shulker box" *proceeds to throw away shulker shells*
I don’t know about this game being made for children just take a look at the warden and tell me that is for children.
How did he get the ladders?
And their children will be horribly disfigured from all the inbreeding. What do you mate with the dragon or endermen or both or yourself. Best line ever though
200
Go to 15:35, and he said he would make it look nice in the END
😵‍💫😵‍💫
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😄😄🤯
“Quote me do it”
1000 days- Minecraft end
Yeh but like actually how did you get that torch
where the hell did he get the chests
I would just live in a end city ... commet "same" if you wouldv'e too-
Congrats On  4m subs
22:16 how did you eat that and not fall.
26:52 is that Adolf Hitler?
"men really be living like this and see no problem with it"
17:50
No
what about having a friend or someone to stay in the over world and say when it is the next minecraft day
41 days and he forgot you can use 2 shulker shells and 1 chest
I don't like it I love it
Hi, I know its old but instead of building portal u can use /setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:ender_portal (I dont remember name but if u write portal it will show suggestion)
The emphasis he put in reminding us that raw diamonds are useless.
I get the fresh one fresh one fresh one fresh one one fresh one fresh Fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh
I like it how blocks are more useful than diamonds lol
You are 14 ??????
Cops: 8:45
When he said more creative then you it's true I suck at houses in minecraft because I'm not in java
i watched the entire thing this entertains me great job at doing the challenge successfully
Kill vilager
I hope he does 200 days
why dinent get sholcers
Mining away
Shulker box
POV: Where Did You Get The Torch?!!? LTN: not tellin' ya
SUS
I’m actually gonna try what u told me! I’ll record it on my channel and upload it on Sunday! (February 13) check it out if you wanna see it at Sunday luke!
A M O N G  U S
I didn’t know you had a daughter oh and if you didn’t see that then  I just spoiled
I’m not a nerd   Luke: dosent just use one ender chest and accidentally finds that 1. What you put in one you put in all 2. They keep the items the chest in your invintory (similar to a shulker)    So, he could have had 2 ender chests on the opposite side of the ender dragon and filled them up with healing, they go back and forth
You could’ve used
Y did u not break the loot chests and make a shulkerbox
Me pa zu zu zu a zu zu zu. Me pa AMA Cosom yum yum yum me paaaaaaaaaaaa zu zu zu zu zu zu zu
you dont have to do commands , just do f3 then f4
Chorus fruit to regenerate likes health the fruit I am health care
In three thousand days you should do a pixel art of yourself
Where DID he get that torch though? End city?
how did you did challenge if I was in your place I was ding of being lonely
BRO NFT WTF
You should do a challenge where u have 5 min to loot the overworld then you go to the end
"quoting me in the comment section of my own video."
Rewatching this I realized Luke could've just went though the end gateways instead of bridging to the main island
I 💕 Your Videos We Love You
Not gonna lie gas station food is pretty good. It might be that I go to classy gas stations like Casey’s and speedway, but dang they better than subway!
He knows that he can just go through the portals and it would bring him to the dragon island right?
I tried thus on my phone and kept on dieing lol

"Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me."  -Luke TheNotable, 2021
"And their children will be horribly disabled from all the inbreeding" LMAOOOO. Caught me waayyy off guard with that one
I saw armor shaped a among us player
The entire time I was thinking “omg just make a shukler box” and then he mentioned one for the first time at around 14:00 and I was like “oh wait yeah you need a crafting table for that-“
Respect to day ur mom
You should do “100 Days - [Minecraft Amplified]”
2:22
I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHY END CITIES CHESTS DONT HAVE ANY AXES?
pp
1 day in Minecraft is 20ms!
Voice reveal, AYYYYYYY!!!
Amazing very good teach me your way’s please
I’m only like a fifth of the way through but does he know there are crafting tables are in the end cities?
Did he predict the rise of nft’s
did he forget about shulker boxes?   edit: i forgot theres no way to get wood in the end, i havent slept
this vid was so bad, like really boring, but i still liked it
"I will not do this again unlike the nether." I wanna see what the over world looks like in your world from this video.  Next title: I Spent a 200 Days In the End, Pt2 - The Over Wolrd. Lol
Get a better skin dude
Him: I GOT AN ELYTRA WITH NO ARMOR! Me: I JUST CAN’T GET AN ELYTRA EVEN THOUGH IM IN DIAMOND ARMOR!
Hmm that looks easy let's try it!  trys it ⊙﹏⊙ HOW DOES HE DO ITTT
You killed your only company in the end
It’s so unbelievable that he managed to do this, but it’s still amazing to see.
I love it
Why didnt u make a shulker-box? Why didnt u take a enderchest?
I made a among us character but it's hollow
to damage the dragon, you must hit its head or chest
where DO you get a torch though im shocked
Placing torches down turns end stone into dirt.
best youtuber ever we all know that
No luke violence is never the answer...       it's a question and the answer is yes
Give me ur nfts
Bro I lost brain cells when you would none stop hit it in the legs, HIT THE ENDERDRAGON IN THE HEAD PLEASE
What’s that purple and black thing in his inventory in day 11
Can we say da babby
Why is your skin alex if you Are a boy?
I love your new house!
I love the floor
where did the ladders come from??!
25:49 ?? Is it creative or hardcore? Tho
Nice house
you are good youtuber. i like you videos
"If you don't like it make sure to comment down below and ill make sure to not read it"
You can get saplings from the chests
Hevin dose igzist
You do know that if you put slabs for the floor of your house you could have made your house taller because endermen don’t spawn on them
Why didn’t you just kill the dragon in creative and respawn her then you could have came back and kill her later
u can get to heaven thru Jesus, i acn tell u more
missed oppurtinity tbh  Everytime i eat, i YEET
“ENDER DRAGON”— Luke
I actually like the end as it is right now, it gives me half life 1 xen vibes, if it ever gets a revamp id hope they keep this vibe
I know it's gonna be a while but when your daughter grows up I would like a series with her and also maybe tors
23:10 How did he get picture frames?  You need sticks and leather. I know, he did not get sticks and leather, from those loot boxes.   Cant believe everything you see
He is going insane do do do he legit is losing his mind lol do do do do do
3:32 HOw DarE YoU!!                              -every Minecraft fan including me
Ah yes the only food is the gum gum fruit
:0>=-
Weres tors?
Y is it 29 mins
Your the most noteable crazy man in the world !
you soud make your roufe 8 blocks thick !!
Not in the game. Don't ever say that (heaven doesn't exist again). 👿
13:32 that actually works with any tool/armour peice although it does remove enchants. So if mending isn't feasible and you dont mind losing/have no enchants you can do that.
Luke's voice is so nice. Honestly a lot of times I just listen to his videos as background noise to hear his voice.
also sometimes you hear a train sound then it stops when you're flying in the end
in bedrock sometimes when you look at endermen in creative a sound that isnt them screaming plays and its so creepy
I am a banana
11:36 amogus
he should do one in the nether...anyone agree with me??
You should send your end character to the nether and vise versa as i'd like to see what they do
15:15 just like tors     I'm sorry that was a joke don't come at my house
*Luke became an ancient builder.*
I swear I thought he said ThAtS WhY I AlWaYs FlY WiTh My BaLls OuT

My favorite part was when he said My inventory is kind of looking sus
27:55 bruh that end city be looking like a t-rex
It wasnt just the Ender chests, you could've been making Shulker Boxes xD
Next one : 100 days in real life
He could craft an anvil and then combine all his diamond swords and armour into a great set
it was painful watching him not make a shulker box
at this point his wife must think he is insane
I tried 12 times and never got anywhere

100 Days - [Minecraft Bedrock]
Can u do a (minecraft 100 days in RL craft) plsss
Which version
I did enjoy watching this video. Thank you Luke :).
Is it just me or does the Monument always looks like Hitler?
"Yeah, you see it? They're doing it right now. Quotin' me. In the comments section on my own video." - Luke TheNotable
There is a theory that the ancient civilisation of Builders of minecraft that built structures like ocean monuments went to the end but didnt have any way back to the overworld. So they had to do the same thing like you. And their diet of corase fruit slowly gave them teleportation powers and turned them into the endermen we know. Some of them eventually are able to telwport back to the overworld. I jist had to thibk aboit thos while whatching this video
Do either  200 days end or 100 days no mining I did the ladder... it was great. (What you thought it was hard Haha.  With the right  seeds and loot it was ez
Nobody: absolutely nobody: his inv is sus *AMOGUS*
holy cow he made nft's into a joke before it was a joke
Has anyone noticed the portal to the end islands next to his first end city
12:13 MLG PROGAMER MOVE CLUTCH
I like a lot your house
Luke: violence is the answer  Me: thanks for reminding me `w`✨
Fake you cant get crafting tables wich means you cant craft end stone bricks
11:36
11:36
9:10 that "Perfect" was perfect
Could of used the chests from the end city loot to make shimmer boxes
11:34
on day 5 u died like 8 times. how did you even post this!?
Pov: luke goes to see what he's on and it says, DAY 99
Cool 😎
According to MatPat, this is what the old builders went through.
19:22
Hmmm i still cant beleive he hasnt and every other youtuber havent done 100 days floating island
26:26 how did he get that torch?  Edit: I think he got it from the ender dragon nest
100 days in minecraft cave
WHERE’D YOU GET THE TORCH!?
Do you know if you could build a nether portal in the end and had some flint you could go onto the Nether the into the overworld
Next video plunging my daughters poo for 100 days
You died but you were in hard-core By an Enderman
Lol u cheating

He was like shit  my mic is  On
wait... i think u can always check the numbers of days the world is by pressing f3, genuine question
Do it again with a sapling and a dirt🙄🙏
Anyone notice how Luke mentioned nft’s?
How matpat's ancient civilization theory would look like
im gonna watch this again when the end update comes out and lets you live in the end and see how terrible it was before
Monument looks like a certain mustachioed man with a history of hating east coast bankers
He died at 3:03 and probably used the open to Lan hack
M
Lägga mig snart får du inte göra
The whole playthrough is basically just trench warfare.
You know curse of vanishing only works when you die so you should of picked up that iron chest plate
i hope they add end biomes like forests and like end specific ores
That head by your House looks familiar, coughs in german
Next one : I survived 100 days in a tree.
Do 100 Days (Ocean)
How tf did he get the torch?
Your def my new favorite minecraft content creator i appreciate you good sir 🙏 keep up the great work
the house design in the end is so cool! good work
Fake 100 days at end city couse you died and you use command to still alive
is it just me or did the enderman on the thumpnail have a mustache?
13:20 made my dogs head tilt lol
Nether: End city = Piglin place thingy (idk what it is called) End islands = Normal land Void = Lava The food (idk what it is called) = The food in the nether (idk what it is called)  Over World: End city = Villages End islands = Normal land Void = Lava Crops = The food (idk what its called)
26:29 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘥𝘪𝘥 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘥𝘦𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 - Luke TheNotable 2021 Me:How is it deforestation if there are no trees?

I love it
17:49
good
Heaven doesn't exist in minecraft but it does in real life man.
NEXT ONE SHOULD BE 100 DAYS SKYBLOCK
You can get out go to the ender dragon break a crystal to get fire build a nether portal and bang wood
Luke: who needs iron? Anvil: sniffles
Whres the nft???
18:20
Alt title: minecraft, but hardcore, but no tree, but no crafting, but trapped in worst dmension where you cant even go to nether and to go to any other dimension and get out you need to kill the dragon BUT NO CRAFT NO TREES
11:34 SUS😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
shulker boxes?
"At Least I Have A Place For My More Worthless Items LIke Diamonds" Hold Up- 9:25
This is Minecraft version of "Cast Away".  Adapting to the environment and trying not to go crazy from loneliness.
aww congrats on your daughter Luke
Next 100 days overworld
Revelation 21:4-7 "There will be no more death , or mourning , or crying , or pain. I am making everything new. Yes! I am coming soon.". . Revelation 16:15 ("Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!") . John 14:6  Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me...
10/10 on ender house
you din't kill anything lol, it dammaged so much from thorns lol
uuuuuuuhm... that obsidian beard makes the monument look like a certain german dictator... ye know, the austrian one
Luke: I hope you enjoyed watching but if you didn't then well it's not like you can unwatch the video. Me: *unwatchs the video* Luke: You weren't supposed to do that-
Theatracical masterpiece
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 BOO BOO BOO😑😑😑😑😑 I AM COOLER 😂😂😂😂😂LOL
Dummy
No     No 4M
i love the floor
When the end portal is a little sus:
this is like 300hours
You should have done a iron trap door with presure plate
Hey Luke I actually did the nether and creative and old
Look the notable and your next and 100 days you should really take the ladders from the end ships and put them on your pillar so you can fly around from your house a lot
I dont like it
“Yep, you’re doing it right now, quoting me” -Luke the notable
It's a huge handicap not being able to get wood. It must be frustrating to have all of the required ingredients for a lot of things, but be unable to obtain them because you have no crafting table. Things that fall under this category that I can think of are endstone stairs and slabs, shulker boxes, diamond/iron/gold/emerald blocks and anvils. I guess you could get these eventually if you killed the dragon, so it's not a total loss with the apparently useless items.
11:35 “AmonGGGUs” BEST PART
how does he know that the day has ended in the end
some trash suggestions: dig tunnel through the end pillars up in a spiral stair shape to go up, and then break the end crystals that way, after breaking all of them, get down through the spiral stairs and punch the dragon with fists till it dies, and use ender pearls to pearl into outer end islands. this probably will take 30 days tho lol
No but really tho, how’d he get dat torch
100 day in the new caves and cliffs
Do 100 days in overworld without seeing the sun
10:42 really couldn't just not bash on christianity? Heaven does exist, and with talk like that you won't go there when you die. My question though is why did you have to put that in there? Got something against christianity? Just pathetic really.
do 200 days in the end
road asmr, love it
17:53 day 51 what did he sayyy?? ○▪︎○
If you haven’t already, do 100 days in an endless minecraft ocean, or 100 days in an endless minecraft desert??
What was the command
you cheated!
my cats going crazy
Tbh if he gave himself some dirt and saplings I wouldn't have cared.
Me looking for the elytra. When you realize you didn’t bring enough food that’s when it REALLY turns into survival mode.
Why are you Alex??
his builds look leagues better than before epic vid
100 days in minecraft spectator mode (definitely very entertaining)
11:33
how did you get leather to make photoframe
"I used to work at McDonald's" me watching this while at work in a McDonald's
Llamas with hats...I've been trying to figure out who he sounds like..Carl, from Llamas With Hats
Cool
How u know the days?
Imagine how hard it is to start in the end without trees HAHAHAHA
I would actually really love to see you survive in the end again but with one sapling and some dirt.
I did this once on my own four kicks one time and it's fun working logistics but also.... so desolately lonely
Why get the ender chest when you could get a shulker box
HE CUSSED!!!!16:44
If it has gunpowder it's a bomb -me trying to blow up luke the notible
"see, they're doing it right now... Quotin' me, in the comment section... On my own video" bro I felt that
the jokes are as big as your MOM
You hit the Ender Dragon on the bottom part of the head
11:36 *Ã  M  Ø  Ğ  Ú  Ş*
26:52 Kinda Looks like Hitler not gonna lie.
2:22
Him: atleast I'll have a place to put my useless diamonds Me: useless?!  Me then realizing there is no wood in the end so no wood = no crafting table and no crafting table = no diamond armor so there is no use for diamonds
i spent so long trying to figure out how he got a torch but im just gonna give the benefit of the doubt cause im sick of trying to figure it out
I would never survive doing this you’re so good at Minecraft 👍👍👌👌🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Im 9 not betad that dragon
27:55 T-rex end city!!!
@26.40 luke makes hitler
My Question.... Why did he never make shulker boxes?? They are made from chests and shulker shells, both of which you get from end cities.
okay that alex monument looks like hitl-
I love your voice. I’d know it anywhere 🤣 but I’m still trying to figure out your accent? 🤔🤔🤔🧐🧐🧐🤨🤨🤨🤨
Ladder at 22:55? I think ladder are in some end city’s right
You know you should’ve said this while it shows that you’re mining: my name the way to your mamas house boy!

Wow. I did not expect this to be entertaining. MINING IS INTERESTING PEOPLE.
congrates for million subscribers!👌
Man could’ve thrown a ender pearl at the gateway
200 days in the end. But the nether is allowed. Use the obsidian and find a way to light it (or cheat only to light it)
I wish Luke had and made his own skin, instead of using the alex skin
Alternative title: My as an  endstone miner for 100 days
Make 200 days nether
You're bad
217 50
1:40 cave noise that luke thenotable didnt notice
Like shows us anything is possible.
It's funny how Lukes funniest commentary comes from the stuff that's the hardest to commentate
randomly teleported (random time for teleportation ) or teleported in a random place-1:16
9:23   atleast i have a place to put some of my more worthless items like diamonds  -Luke TheNotable    edit:i put the dash in the wrong place
13:50
The gum gum fruit =chorus fruit
The fact that you made purpur blocks actually look good is amazing. I love watching your videos because they make me laugh... Also can you maybe do 100 days in RL craft?
Why can you use any end mods
@Luke TheNotable The file can it be in .jar form?
“And their children, will be horribly disabled from the inbreeding
A M O N G U S 11:36
With enough blocks you can bridge away from the dragon
26:14 ayo how did you get the torch
whre u get torch from
If they add a bunch of stuff to the end like they did with the Nether I would love to see a revisit to this world. Or just on the 3000 days vid. Honestly I just really like your content.
A great man once said "if has a door it's home"
Hey man, you uploaded this vid in my birthday and if i already wrote a comment like this, id like to thank you again because it made my day
Me when I saw the torch: CHEATER CHEATER HES A CHEATER!! My Brother: You cheat all the time. Me: Shhhh dont tell them that! My brother: Whos the- Me: SHHHHHHH
Luke : I CAN MINE!!!!! Me: Bro if you just had given yourself a set of wood tool- Luke: THIS WILL NEVER GET OLD  Me: Now I gotta live with this.
POV you have dirt and a tree
Man, 200 days in this would be great
"Most if you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me" - Luke TheNotable, 2021
Where in the end did you get a torch ? DID YOU CHEAT !
Luke TheNotable would be the type of fella to look at 1970s urban architecture and say “oh look at the pretty houses”
I love the floor design❤️😁
wait how did he get that torch
Dont forget eye of ender! wait 😑
Shulker box are backpacks. If you see this its good for 200 days and etc.
I think your really funny
inbreeding? cringe
“Most of you are unoriginal and quote me”
its a good floor
Fun fact: explosions damage from crystals, beds,etc. goes to feet not head and torso
Life-less void doo doo
25:13 "Yep they're doing it right now quoting me in the comments section on my own video." That is funny
25:10 omg!!
you sus
Why did you slow Mo among us meme it’s super weird and funny at the same time I don’t know why
'Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me." -Luke TheNotable
end, more like ur mom
i love how existentially boring this is
Really though…how did he get that torch?
"I passed up on another ender chest" - after passing up on the opportunity of crafting like 15 shulker boxes :')  edit: I'm stupid you can't event make a crafting bench ofc
The way resource restrictions affected your base; in how it was built reminded me of how I do my world building.  Good job!
"I'm building a stairway. Not to heaven, no. That doesn't exist."
Tbh this is pretty much how the endermen where made
calling minecraft 'a game for children' is insulting to all the adults who play it
How can you know the days without sun?
21:19, why did Luke do a Sos Mula adlib 😂
Wait yea how tf did he get a torch????
You could have used the obsidian to make a nether portal then make another one in the nether I'm pretty sure you would have been able to come back to the over world.
🐀🥰🥰
Lifeless void do do you do do  do do do
Nft or non fungible tokens rule
Why didnt luke make shulker boxes
This dimension needs an update that isnt oh we added 1 new outer biome and wings. new ores new biomes actually somewhat habitable.
Did anybody see the torch in 26:17?  Not trying to be rude mr . Notable,but where did you get that?
Cheating in hardcore?
Wait me have idea use the obsidian to go to the nether then make another portal and get to the overworld
'Ender balls' really?
I hate your floor design
20 mince is a day in minecraft.
That iron helmet on day 51. Is better then the dimand helmet cuz there’s no. Fire in the end and it had. Fire protection
No
How did you get ladders?
His statue looks like World War II German man
100 days in a village?
technically you could kill endermen for pearls to teleport on top of the towers to destroy the crystals then punch the ender dragon to death
11:36 AMONGUS
you guys are probably quoting me in the comments rn - Luke TheNotable Aka LTN - 2021
How can you tell when it’s the next day?
Amog us
Where is the link?
Wait an NFT he predicted nfts
14:15 there was a cave noise!
How did he get ladders tho
An old friend of mine try to make trees, ores, and other food products. But he didn't know how and broke the end on his computer. What I mean by that is the end looked like the overworld in the end.
Get me too 1m subs
If he didn't make a skulker box by the end of this video, I will die  edit after 1 year for some reason: Yeah i guess there is no crafting table so uhh my bad.
11:36 is SUS
That nft joke punched me in the liver

“End rod, my first place able block!” Chorus flower: am I a joke to you?
Tip to Luke: I know you don't have any blocks at the start but you can bridge to the outer end islands If you had blocks
Wait  How u get that torch???
ENDERMENS

Your house and other stuff
It looks amazing
How did he get the torch or the laters though?
I like the house you made it was so cool
Alright but he started with nothing but his bare fist and managed to make bases tunnels roads stairs all to benefit him into 100 days the end I feel like he took this 100% more safer than 100 days and I can see why
luke your not notable your simp: SUPER Intense MINECRAFt PLAYer
Your on day 101
Is no one angry about how he never wore the iron chestplate cause it has curse of vanishing.. Even though it means it disappears when you die he's in hardcore if he dies its over so it doesn't matter...
“Somewhere to put less valuable items like diamonds”😂
Circle
the fucking endstone miners joke got me too hard
👍🏼
I like your videos but please don’t copyright minecraft 100 days cause I also like other 100 days made by other youtuber.
Who notice the diamond pick is break
Nice
"Yep there they are now, quoting me on my own video" - idk

I love your YooTube so much we love you so much
11:33 sus
27:38 called it
"bro where did he get a torch that torch he cheating i saw" -luke the notable
If you do 200 days Just use the obsidian to get to the nether
18:50 holy shit you got me smiling there.
Nah
You have 4mil
No, heaven DOES exist
This man's beat the fucking game.. WITHOUT CRAFTING A CRAFTING TABLE
11:49 kinda sus
:]
5:14 I was laughing
You can do this without cheats actually, just go to create world and then shift key and you can access custom worlds then you do a floating island world with the end island type set to it
He was complaining about not having a shulker box but he had chests and shells so he could have made one
luke the not able man
“Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me” -LukeTheNotable 2021
The fact quake pro isn’t your default is depressing
25:09 "if it has a door its home"
How'd you know when days end when there is no day/night in the end it's a little bit sus
U have like so many 💯 days
Day 1 is a Terrible start  12 days later It's a banger
Noooo you didnt go through the portal then make to the surface
Cobblestone texture is same as endstone tho endstone is inverted colour of cobblestone
Luke is bestt
i love ur base
How TF did you get ladders...?
heaven does exist.
Use shells with chests from city to get shulker boxes.
that one enderman trying to get in the house but ur just putting a wall that blocks it
THIS IS EPIC
I'm still confused how he got torches and ladders
He got the torch from the ended Dragon landing place made from bedrock
It's weird that when the end update came out it seemed massive but now it's kinda small
Make a neither portal  then make a nuther
tommyinit
Luke is very notable he knows when the days start and end in the end
I just had an idea for a series. You should do 100 days in the end, then on the same world 100 days in the nether, then on the same world 100 days in the overworld
If he would have a flint he would escape using obsidian
This is more *mine* than *craft* but I mean, what were we expecting? It's the End.
Bro why did you not craft circles
11:36
THERE IS A CROSS OVER THERE WTF!?!?! 11:11
We will come to get you in U.S.A :)
I was raging half the video before I realized you can't make shulker boxes WITHOUT A CRAFTING TABLE - brain fart on my part  Also, would the elytra have helped in the dragon fight? I dunno, maybe, to help glide down
And I’m Luke I wanna I wanna I want you to make more and videos but always about you but picture on the other YouTube videos make sure you add more and then go in the end and then they can be three different orders and even another right there too or you can add you can add anything you to the end next year
7:50 Nerve racking.  2025  2:30 The atmosphere and that soundtrack is incomprehensibly beautiful.
In the nether everything wants to kill you   In the end there is absolutely nothing except funky fruits and the colors purple and yellow
sEcONd 10:44 iS diScRImiNaTinG
Hey man, we were both unskilled McDonald's burger flippers. It's nice to know I'm not alone with my arm burns
diamonds in the overworld: rare and strong  Diamonds in the end: Im useless with out you wood😕🥺
3:28 chorus flower: AM I JOKE TO YOU??
It acually is possible if you use enderpearls to get one the towers and break the enter crystals then slowly punch the dragon in the face until it dies
You shouldve used better end so u can  make a survival world it has stone and  wood
am i the only one who noticed that out of nowhere he just gets 3 ladders on day 6 4:00
Lol his house is pretty
Day ur mom is relatable
15:05 I want to see Luke voice Rick lol.
Lmao 17:51
Mojang: beds don't work so people can't live in the end  Minecraft YouTubers: no
Luke: nothing too notable  Me: but you are the luke the notable
I want this to be an actual story
"yeah that's why I always fly with my ender balls out" - A Fully Grown Man 2021
Loads of shulker shells and chests.. couldve made shulker boxes
Gud job man! I’m poo poo head so Idk why u couldn’t craft a shulker box. I thought they only need a chest and chiller shells. Both of which u had. Plz answer in the comment s thanks
nais
100 days farming simulator 19
sounds fake but idk
That end house is amazingly awesome Why.did I not think of that that's beautiful but then again I don't have the real game which means no end dimension
Hearing Luke say "*A      M         O         N       G             U      S*"        Very refreshing
Okay I need to do this
You should’ve used the better end mod
WHY DID YOU NOT TAKE THE ELYTRA AT THE END CITY
I know how he got torches from the bedrock fountain
Your house look lovely ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I like how his skin was alex
nice
How did he get the wood for the item frames?
continue but now u have access to the over world so well u r gonna be a god
A lot of you are unoriginal and just quote me-Luke the notable 2020
I did say make a shulker box one time, then I remembered my stupid self forgot you need a crafting table and the only wood are *C H E S T S*   Also cant believe he had the guts to survive in the end in VANILLA
Yeah, I called it.. it was a useless chorus farm.. not so more creative then me now, huh??
Where is 3,000 days
The one minecraft 100 days where they dont make a crafting table
wait, end citys have chest, and shulkers, why didnt you make a shulker after the first one
Make it for pocket edition because I only have a phone and I play pocket edition
26:26 he probably got it from the return portal, it has torches on it.
Other people: why is it so hard to get to the end Lukethenotable: Now let’s find our way to the overworld
M
Day 78 I love the design
4:58 the rarest enchantment ever (curse of vanishing)
The absolute torture of having shulker shells and chests in your inventory the whole playthrough, but never having access to a crafting table
Apathy: a lack of interest
Your asking people to stop making 100 days videos
He got the torch from the dragons nest
lmfao i love the shade being thrown at NFTs in the video
ALL THE VIDEOS WERE REAL DAYS AND NO CUTTING IT WOULD SO LONG
you should really do a 100 days skyblock
Damn... I usually have a problem watching one thing until the and, but you Luke grabbed my attention whiteout even one pause. Love from Bulgaria 🇧🇬.
L

That is an good house!   Stay positive!!!
The voice makes it better
W H E N W H E N W H E N
I tried this but I couldn't find a dang end city
The house looked insane
11:34. Luke: ''My innovatory is looking pretty sus.'' scary voice ''Among us us.''
100 days in Minecraft would be 2000 mins
“The other hand”
It triggers me so much that he says he would do anything to get a shulker box… YOU HAVE CHESTS, AND SHULKER SHELLS!!! Chest+shulkershells=SHULKERBOX
Like destroying the endermen for 30 sec
11:33 hemmmm?
Ur cheater
man i wish people didnt milk this to death
Hear me out  END UPDATE
Hi
Not to hate or anything but how did Luke make item frames
You can make sulker ...
Items their adding in 1.18: skulk, skulk, and more skulk, a skulk boss, deep cobblestone, that's it
W
*Over world gets uptade* *nether gets uptade* End: SO IS THERE A CHANCE :D mojang: let's just pretend u never existed
Him:Gets a torch Me:How? teach me ur ways
u got free the end achievement but wut about the wood achievement
If i had thoes items i would be Like: I AM RICH

11:37 LMAO 🤣🤣🤣
Day ur mom
I really hope the End update, when it finally comes, will keep the alien weirdness of the End while adding more variety, some source of wood, and other important resources.
What’s the command
Sword did nth cuz you were aiming at the back, not at the head
i saw this and i copy the same thing, and yea it was pretty great i didnt have to store my stuff in chest i crafted shulker box
Wait if he somehow made a nether portale in the nether he can make a another one to go to the over world
I stopped watching you because of the thing u did to others
Alternative name: I committed mass endermen genocide for 100 days
When he says oh I have 16 ender pearls and now he actually has 14😂😅🤣
send  link to the nft?
Luke.. You do realize you can only do damage by hitting it’s head when it’s perched. Right?
10:42 K.. That was a little uncalled for.
For people saying to make a Shulker Box  Crafting Table
You should do this again but with some mods
LTN: 64 days Me: a stack of days
‘ yes your  quoting me right now’  Lukethenotable  aka god
Screw you game thoery he survived 100days  and he did not turn into an enderman
i fought the ender dragon in 10 minuts with a  sharpness IV netherite sword
How did he get an itemframe?
"Wow what is this monstrosity a chorus fruit farm? That's pretty much useless!" - Luke the notable, after saying “Yep, you’re doing it right now, quoting me.”
Heaven exists
shouldve bought a clock to see days
There's actually a way to get ender pearls without killing them directly, setup a two block high shelter for you and boats underneath it, all you have to do is  look at the endermen, theyll get angered, teleport towards you and get stuck in the boats and suffocate and die. Easy Although this should probably be done on your normal hardcore world
Try 200 days in the end but add a mod so trees spawn in the end (dont like this pls)
X
Can you please change your skin
If Luke was Insane His name would be Luke the insane
I was screaming at my phone telling like to make shulker boxes in the first like 30 days
Did he just say sus...ARE YOU-am scriming in my mic
I mean, it dosen’t really matter if you get curses or not
6:43 ha, those losers on java don't have speed bridging!
l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l

What am I think I have an idea why undermines exist can I say villagers found the end portal don’t portal at that time was fully open all that stuff they going to the end but there was no and your dragon they want to and world got stuck there for all eternity and they only a chorus fruit and that’s how they got the teleporting powers
Mk so u said ur not sure if its been a day or not at the start so let me help    Each day is 20 mins long and because ur doing that for 100 days thats 20 × 100= 2000 so ud need a recording with no editing to be 2000 mins or 2000÷60 is 33.3333 so ud need a recording that lasts 33 hours and 35 mins
How... Did you get the torch?
Please please continue this series
Wat will you do after all dis den... 1 like 🤣🤣 ore 10000 dislike

The end
3:25 Corous fruit flower: 😿👍
No I'm not building a stair way to heaven because that doesn't exist that dont sound right lol
I don't like the idea of your mom
How did he get the torch?
I’m curious as to why you never built any shucker boxes. That would have helped a bunch!
i'm getting sick of seeing chees
I like the floor
11:49 🗿
This was the hardest challenge 😬
You can fix elytra by inventory  Grindstone: what am I for just to suffer?

When you get Sky’s the Limit before Stone Age…
i tried to survive 100 days in the end.......I HATE ENDERMEN!
Luke, hitting the dragon's legs doesn't do anything since it doesn't have a hitbox.
You are so so so good
Heaven does exist
The quoting you call out actually just made my sad self cackle  These videos are good for the vibes
You don't sound like 17 but you sound like 21   Edit I just my one-year-old comment on this video and I'm still wondering what I was talking about

3:14 end gate way/ pie
How jou get a thorch
Ender balls
When you start a new world you can start with a chest. If it where me I’d let you take the contents of that chest.
What I would have done would be to take the end city you found on day 17 and turn it into a home
If the end gets a revamp, I'd like to see you continue this playthrough.
How do you git chests you got no wood
U SUSSY BECAUSE U GOT A TORCH EVEN ITS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE END BAKA
i love your house can u help me to bulid that house
How can he knew the days
Do u know that u can combine picaxe and the enchantment and the durabilty and others
It’s not impossible you can kill endman pearl up to the crystals and repeat then punch the dragon
do 200 days in the end
I hope you surviv
Love the house
3:22 wa- bu- th- giddaisj- it’s not- but-  NOOOOO
25:20 Luke dabaitable
You could actually get wood by mining the ladders on the end city ship ;)
you can use the chests you get from the end cities and the shulker shells to make shulker boxes that you can put in your ender chest for even more storage space
Spend typing 10years hahahahahaha amongus 😆😆😆😅😅😅😅☺☺☺
I like it see this video before i just wana see again im notable
You hit 4M! Congrats Luke!
The thunbmail-
In 2000 or 1000 days in hardcore Minecraft Luke thenotable almost died

Let's go life less void do do do life less void do do do
So this is basically "Minecraft but I can't craft, but in the End"
Bro when you forget shulker boxes are a thing LMAO
15:30 also could've made shulker box with the chests from the end cities
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥱😭😭😢😭😭😭😭😭😇😙😇😇😇😇😇😭😭😭😭
My children will be endstone miners, and there children will be end-to-end miners, and there children will be horribly disabled from all the inbreeding

Let’s eat
fun fact : u can have sign then a item frame together then put a block to the item frame and name the sign of the type of block
The impolite yacht equally fry because dock phylogenitically prevent up a energetic cocktail. abrasive, hard-to-find jeep
You did it now luke😄
praise to allah my brother
He got the torch from the end like the dragon pedestal
Yes, an iron helmet with protection 4 is better for general defense as opposed to a diamond helmet with no protection.
Day ur mom is the worst day.
Hi
I have the vanilla tweaks datapack that means you can craft things like bread and shulkers in your inventory crafting and I forgot it wasn’t a feature in actual minecraft and got so confused when he said he couldn’t craft shulkers lol
200 days
I want more of this
It’s not day 64 it’s a stack of days
Ok
WHATS THE POINT OF GETTING A Elytra if you don’t have any fireworks
Lol

I downloaded his world file so I subbed hit the bell icon and liked the video for payment
They should upgrade the End lile they did the nether. New Ender mobs, Structures, and Plants.
The torches probably came from the bedrock portal thing since there’s 4 of them there
As someone who’s scared off endermen I couldn’t do this challenge, it’s the way they teleport out of nowhere and jump scare you. I’m 20 years old and have been playing minecraft for about 10 years it’s that bad
Im starting to think the end is on the moon
Did I just see a lader 😑
This vid isn’t 30 minutes 😭 had to cut something It’s 29:42 but used to be 30:01
It's easy once you loot an end city your set the only hard part is doing it with out wepons
3:11 wait is that ...BEDROCK
I dare you to watch the story of Minecraft
“Quote me in the comment section. Of my own video”  Done your welcome
Me screaming at him to make a shulker box also me realizing that you can’t craft
hey try to survive minecraft AT ONLY NIGHT i mean should always be night
Man this notable Luke is a trooper...no he's a God
New Title: Minecraft Hardcore but u can die
I love it
Imagine eating a chorus fruit and out of nowhere you hear the chorus of a random song
Can you do this again (in 1.18 "the end update")
Why did you quit for a bit?
“Had a nasty poo”
Bro ltn is the real best Minecraft player he can survive anywhere
"Thats why I always fly with my ender balls out" I want to make this my senior yearbook quote
lifeless void do do do do do do do life less void do do do do do do do lifeless void!
16:44 isnt this guy "kid friendly"?
God loves you. John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”. Jesus Christ died for you so you could be saved from hell and live in heaven with Him after you die, and all you have to do is put your faith in Christ. Repent of all of your sins, and be cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ. Believe in the Lord God Jesus Christ, and your name will be written in heaven! May the Lord richly bless you.😊
" My Infant daughter had a poo"these lines had me dead 😂
End needs an update
I am…. Surprised about your skill in survive in the end
Ah yes end sentient life with your bare habds
Luke vs the ender dragon trench warfare
16:37 lol your mic was on you were like shit my mic is on LOL
I know I could NOT do this, Imagine living in a void with rocks and the only living thing you see are these tall black things that can't really talk and attack you if you look at them and This giant dragon! I think I'd go insane with the only thing pushing me is the thought that, I could maybe just maybe beat the dragon. This makes the "Free The End" achievement seem to have more value.
It’s very beautiful
Torch is found at ...............   The dragon island!!!

I think his Channel is broken
Shoutout Mickey ds yo
If you do 200 days give yourself a 64 stack of dirt and a sapling

i love it

11:36 amososmsussymogus
Once i went in end kil dragon go overworld an go bak to end AND IT MADE SPOOKY NOISE
Mr. Notable, I think about re-creating what you do, but I'm not experienced enough
Either release 3000 days or make a part 2 of this playrhrough😂
200 days where
Your a dad yay
Alternate title: luke losing his sanity slowly over 100 days
Wait hollll up, how does he know what day it is
Love this video
The unadvised sleep complementarily load because vacuum dentsply reproduce down a beneficial bakery. resonant, colorful oxygen
there's actually a speedrun of beating the enderdragon with 0 items which requires a special 12 eye end portal seed, so if you ever wanna try this again for whatever reason, fight the dragon itemless lol
I dont like the floor
"and their children will be horribly disabled from all the inbreeding" kinda caught me off gaurd
I subscribe :) now bye
No luke. I dont cringe at you for combining elytras. I cringe beacause you never made a shulker.
25:02 Lol
“I’ve erected!”- Luke the notable 2021
I didnt watch I listened it was pretty fun 😁
you could've just build a portal to get loot in the nether, also wood

The wiggly tuna biophysically print because blizzard retrospectively sigh unto a acrid alloy. guiltless, truculent rule
He died and then continued he cheated (got killed by Enderman)
19:22 Funny you mention that, fun fact: The Ender Dragon is female apparently. :/
i have tried this and gained a lot more respect for this man
I love that he said : My infant daughter had a nasty poo
You are so Funny in this episode
Why did he remove the intro?
Omg I loooooove your  house 😍😍😍😍
i like how he starts to lose his sanity as the days go by lol
where did you get the torch to get ender dragon egg
Haha ive been using that repair elytra(weapon,armor andbows)trick
28:14 look like dragon
Lol I work at McDonald’s
The tangy motorcycle frustratingly overflow because jogging consequentially heat among a aromatic reward. ambiguous, befitting bath
So many make a shulker box comments
According to Game Theory, he should be an enderman by now.
I feel your pain I work at one of two of the fast food joints in town flipping burgers.
11:54  dont mind me
0:00 ●————————–––––‐---------30:01
5:34 (thanks for the information nobody wanted to know)
If they make an end update he should do this challenge again
You have a child
AAAAAa0AassAaaaaaaAAAAaaaaAaaAaAaaAAAAAAaaaAqAaAq             Mogus
I wish he became a enderman in the last five days (from eating too much corous fruit)
“Then I tried making a door with iron trapdoors, it didn’t work” -LTN day 80
TRY BEDROCK. Addition
I tried this and it didn’t work but that’s because I’m just really bad at the game and by the way where do you get ladders at because I literally got 16 ender pearls pearls her and ships and end cities and there was no ladders  so I had to enter pearl
his monument looks like it has a hitler moustache
Imagine he turn into enderman at 101 days People who watch lore theory:
I might try it with my sister she probably won’t do it
"Building a staircase to heaven? No, heaven doesn't exist" Almost every christan: REEEEEEEEEEEE
did you know the fruit will randomly teleport you to a flat surface so if you run into the void or something etc. etc. eat them
I made a world in the end that I'm living in but I was given a lot of stuff and I had a bridge to the dragon Island that took me ages to build so I'm not counting this as a true end survival but it is kind of hard to survive trying to avoid looking at enderman especially when I try to cut down an oak tree it's a little scary and pumpkins took forever to grow because it couldn't plant itself for some reason by finally got one pumpkin but I even am a little scared one wrong move and I can probably walk up the edge and die if I'm not careful with my pumpkin mask on I do have a decent underground bunker it's actually thanks to this video I figured I can use slabs to make underground bunker a lot more space made without having enderman come in I'm just letting you know living in the end could be way harder if I didn't give myself stuff but right now I'm just having fun in this world I have big plans for the world I provide myself with
Violence is not the answer. it's the question and the answer is yes
11:53 AmonGUS
Seriously, how did he get a torch in the end?
How did you seriously get the torch because I watched it last night and I fell asleep watching it
why the hell doesnt this guy make shulker boxes
17:03 LUKE SAID THE S WORD REEEE
I will stay notable
This was a long time ago
I really thought you are going to end the 100 serie😅
Hahahaha I thought it was a Coris fruit farm and I was right lol I am creative I guss
luke: *_goes into time machine_* minecraft: "time to release the end update" also luke *_goes back into time machine_* everyone: "200 DAYS IN THE NEW END"
Did you know that you are killing humans when you killing enderman
Every 100 days minecraft video  LukeTheNotTable : I raised that boy
you can still make shulker boxes in the end tho...
but how
why did 14:20 sound like a bass boosted windows intro lmao
Luke how did you get leaders???
Wait, why not make shulker boxes?  edit: oh wait, I'm dumb
Wait, if there is no day-night cycle in the end, does this count as 100 days in the end? 🤨
are you going to do another 100 days I would really like that
me and my brother Adam wanted to survive in the nether 100 days like you did and failed... love your videos Luke - Uno

I really think mojang should update the end and add more content to it end is very boring ☹️
100 days in minecraft bedrock
EXUSE ME):< 30 MINUTES???!!! YOU MEANT 30:1 SECONDS ):<

First placeble block: end rod Chorus flower: am I a joke to you?

I love mincraft and you luke
17:4 LUKE YOU SAID A CURSE WORD
It'S a CoUrAsE fRuIt FaRm
"Why do these in cities have seeds"  *Game Theory with a whole video dedicated to Minecraft lore*   "Well you see...."
When you made the courus farm inside of your house, it looked like a meth lab
Luke how do you use the download? it says something about it not being associated to an app
I don't think I could do this in 20000m days and this is not a hate comment
I can’t- he said ender balls😭
Jesus why do people quote alot
100 days in the aether dimention?
Luke the quotable
Luke: I'm bursting and don't know what to do Shulker boxes made from shells and chests: Am I a joke to you??!
He could have used diamond and gold blocks
You k ow you could combine enchantments with one another with an anvil right
This is basically playing minecraft backwards
since day 35 it went from a 2 to a 10 DRASTICALLY quickly
violence is not the answer it is the question and the answer is YES
IT COULD OF BEEN ALL ONE DAY AND NOT 100 DAYS!!!!!!!!!
18:35 I’m not the only one who saw that
Anyone that watches matpat already knows this man is gonna turn into a enderman
Yes
hey i see a heart inland look for it ur bridgeing to the city its day 48
Normal players- getting an elytra at the end of the game Luke- getting an elytra at the beginning
Heheha 11:30

Did you even think of shulkers?
Luke thenotable went insane
Good
He said “sus”, I’m un-subscribing.

This guy started with ended pearls lol
You said “nah I’m not crazy, I’m just notable”. You see, I hear the same thing🤣🤣😂😂

you found a end gateway right i wonder were it leads considering there isnt one on the main island
My grand grand children are going to be horribly disable
The funny part is, Mojang probably will give the end a more livable update. Possibly sometime soon. Because if they want to add new dimensions, they have to revamp the End. Also, the Deep Dark kinda feels like a pocket End, but that's yet to be determined until Snapshots start rolling out.
Oh you meant that heaven dosent exist in minecraft oh alr I fought you meant rl
I once made the nether a building estate of mine and I lived there in creative where I built alot of stuff
Also, how _did_ you get that torch?
How do i pay you? Luke are u alive in 20218th september
I subed and liked
Ok
hi i beat minecraft in  adventure
You could had at less at better ends
nice vid
If you don't like the design make sure to comment and I will make sure not to read it. That was the best joke of all.
How did he get ladders
I am doing the nether challenge as I’m watching this video
he 4got to make shulker boxes.
Why don’t you use the better end mod
"Yep, they're doing it right now. Quoting me. In the comment section. On my own video."
"Most of you are pretty unoriginal, and just quote me"
*11:55* I hate you.
How did you do this 🙀
Hello! I wanted to say that I think you did really well considering how limited your resources were, and I think you're an expert to make it so far. Plus, I did quite like how you made your house! I'm staying Notable!
i remember when you did fortnite stuff lol
Not anymore I survived 100 days in the end unmodded
How do you tell when a day has passed
Bruh he can make shulker boxes
I am a indian
It is 4 million subscribe
I am and my bro are your fan
4:20 sussest cut ever
i hope minecraft has new end update
i like it
the qualliyy of the thumbnails get worse every video
Hint: There is an chance of teleporting to where you look at with an Chorus Fruit
He got the torch from the main end island because the middle has torches
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
When he was at the end or Dragon I said he’s cranking 90s
200 days
Day 51 funny
I like how he probably spent a lot of time punching a ceiling just to quit and restart
Does he know he can repair his diamond tools with diamonds?
Luke has turned into sb737 he said useless diamonds lol
How did you get ladders 4 minutes into the video
1 million likes for 200 days in the end XD
how does he tell when it's morning/night and it has been a day?
26:46 you can get torches in the end
10:00 20:00 30:00
On which year out of 100 are you in your irl playthrough?  I'm 81 days away from reaching 24
Stamps vines
did you know you can craft shulker box
Also the ender dargon is female
why not try 100 days in a mod
saul
You could’ve made a shulker box to save inventory space. Then again chests might be a valuable thing to keep, and I don’t know your thought process. But yeah, I personally would’ve made a few shulker boxes. But this video was already made and you’ve already finished this world, it’s all over and done with.
LukeTheNotable is the only series with all mining on camera and no mining on camera
💀💀💀
That's crazy! I can't believe you can survive the end! And you can do like everything in Minecraft!
I liked the florr
next things to do are skyblock (singleplayer) one biome challenge and modded (and maybye multiplayer???)
<%)
Day 81 wall
Me the entire video: ANVILS AND SHULKER BOXES.
Luke the no table
Correction:30 mins and 1 sec
lame house
Didnt notice the hiss cuz i have tinnitus
Lifeless void do do do do do do lifeless void do do do do do do do lifeless void do do do do do do lifeless void
He kinda lost it lol
Im finally done with my procrastination - Luke the Notable
Congrats on 4M

Idea for a video : 100 day in a 100 by 100  world
Seriously how did he get the torch ???
did he make a shulker box cause he has everything its just shulker shells and a chest
Among uss
I love the house
UR MOM NOTABLE
Bro why didn’t he just craft shulker box in his inventory
Did I hear DAUGHTER
Why did u defeat the dragon with an iron sword when u have a diamond sword??
22:35 what did I just see, a chorus fruit, NOT TELAPORTING HIM!?!
Make 100 tiers in one day videos again
"don't get me wrong I love reading comments and all, but most of you are unoriginal and just quote me, and I can see you doing it right now."  LTN 2021
Tht was nice
The reason *how did you know the days*
mr. luke the endstone miner, aren't you bored yet?
AMOGUS
I love ❤ your videos
How did you get chest or wood
58% of this video: mining endstone
Luke 30 years later i’m going to spend 1 billion days in hard-core on Minecraft
You could actually beat the dragon with fists. what you would need to do is throw a pearl to get on top of the towers, then throw a second pearl to the next tower, jump off, and destroy the crystal as you're falling to avoid damage Use this method to destroy all the crystals and then just wait for the dragon to perch 100 times nd kill kt with fists.
You cant own 100 days when someone posted it before you usless
21:20 a stack of days
11:04   "I am building a stairway not to heaven because Heaven does not exist.   🤣🤣🤣
Its ok you Deserve 4 Million SUBSCRIBERS
guys he got the torches from the bedrock area at the ender dragon
if you do a 200 days you should make ur roof higher so you cant teleport up there
an iron helmet with protection 1 is the same as a diamond and a prot 4 is prot 3 diamonds
I do not lige the floor
Yes
3:20 pffffffffffffff Day your mom
can you do 100 drops in splitgate
heaven exits i still like your videos though but still heaven exits
man, you've just got to make an anvil after all this op gear, combine it and you've got god's armour set
Bruhh
“i was trying to get back home by day 69” Me: *how convenient*
How do you eat in this world your birthday video and then you get it and then you find my
“Quoting me. In the comment section. Right Now.”
LTN: 100 Days- [Minecraft Ocean World]
end dimension trees update when?
"Yes it is a nice house. Enjoy it while you can, VERMIN"
Bro if you found an End City you have no inventory problem. Next time kill the shulkers and craft shulker boxes. If you don't know how to get chest to craft shulker box, find and breake a chest in the end city.
How much for day 53?
The End, or the beggining?
Did i just hear LTN swear?!?!
Luke does make exciting video's but if he keeps making new series, more people want more part 2's
Hey love mine craft but can we get some more fortnite
actually it IS possible to kill the ender dragon with nothing. step one: make a two block tall hold and kill enderman. step 2: pearl up to the end pillers and break all the crystals. step 3: slay the dragon with your fist. done. :)
That monument looking like golden wind from jojo's
Its so crazy to me that he is able to say that diamonds are not useful items
Yall suck Overworld Normies LOL  I also suck
11:33 dont question just listen    edit: damn 2 moths ago
how did you get the torch?
Idea:100 days in a 100 by 100 world
Try surviving 100 days above the bedrock roof in the nether
Could you put a mod to be a enderman
do 100 drops valorant
luke the notable be like: "100 days - Minecraft superflat but the structures are made of dirt, villages dont exist, the only loot is rotten flesh, and starting in the end, with no end cities
I love the floor
Me : Living my life  LukeThe Notable : Slapping endermans 2:42
How come 5 thousand people have disliked the vid  That's just sad😔  I sub = 1 happy emoji 😊
13:38 I can't tell if he was imitating a plane or the screams of the innocent
“But most of you just quote me.” - Luke TheNotable, 2021 Oooooh, wait, you didn’t want us to quote you there… Oops.
28:14 the end village on the left looks like a dinosaur monument. 🦖
I’d kill to see you do a 1000 days on a popular modded pack like. Mc eternal or something fun. Loved seeing your vanilla play through so I can’t even imagine how much more amazing you can get with modded
I actually tried this challenge but since I suck at Minecraft I failed multiple times
"Stay Notable!" Noted.
14:42
a mon gus
Hi
Congrats on 4million Mr notable new goal : 5 million
27:00 that face looks real familiar but I can’t my finger on it….
I can believe I’d hear the words dimond and trash in the same sentence lol

Crafting table
reasons u should not look at endermen reason 1:u get hurt  reason 2:u get nightmares for the rest of ur life because of the noise it makes
10:28 men really be living like this and have no problem - LukeTheNotable
Luke why did you not get a shulker box?

In the end you can make a tower of enderman😁
"living down here" the end is literaly outer space
i love how he was like "not to heaven......... that dosent exist"
I love your floor
How did he get a torch tho
Why do I feel like he's doing these 100 days videos to stall telling us he died on his 3000 days world
Funny
He could have broken the chest and made shulkers
Mr notable do a 200 day
What if you took the chest and made shulkle box

"I dont have any way to tell the days" The F3 screen: Am I a joke to you
Nice floor
Luke do 100 days in rlcraft
This is how endermen are made according to matpat
I appreciate this quality
I was playing a 100 days. Got to day 66, Went to the toilet and left myself standing next to my wall, I came back and I had died somehow. Sad :(. I played on Bedrock so the world still exists but I'm not going back on it cuz of the challenge.
I like how Luke found a way to still keep the video funny and cool even though almost all of the video was just mining end stone (Love the videos Luke keep up the good work!)
This is so fake.                                                                       Jk
Bet
Do 200 days with the tors

What is diamonds or worthless than me remembers he doesn’t have a crafting table
Hardcore hearts? 1:13
AMONG US 11:53
Hol up he had chests and was killing shulkers constantly, he could have made shulker boxes-
I Saw blue is sus on armor

When he said my infinit dater had a nasty poo it played a add of a car driving
did luke say diamonds are useless?..how dare he!
“Some of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me” heh, check the name-tag buddy
Guys i think he is making 3000 days video
Nearly 500 vids
Before you dumbasses comment "Do 3000 DaYs PlEaSe", he is waiting for part 2 of the cave update to start working on it. Best case scenario it comes out late december or early january
Idk What to do in Minecraft
you should have made shulker boxes
I lose braincells from you thinking you own the 100 days trend 💀💀
When Luke realises you can craft shulker boxes using 2 shulker shells (you can get by killing shulkers) and chests (which you can get from the loot chests) And also when he realises you can craft end stone brick slabs
"When I do crazy challenges I try to remind myself that this game is for children" That's quite an abusive and upsetting approach but ok
Pls upload a new video Where is this month's vid like for new vids
I love how you got back in your world in hardcore and just got revived
I LOVE your vid but can you make a new 100 drops bce i like playing fornight and whcing you play at the same time but i see all the 100 drops like 10s ( you dont have to tho)

waiting for a new halo video day 142
2100 days? They released part of the cave update (deepslate, copper, ETC.)
Would be cool if you let this world sit for awhile then return for 200 days when the inevitable end update arrives
Why are you trying to trademark this you selfish shit not letting other people create content and just have it all to yourself
Anyone else notice the ladders ??
“See? They’re doing it. Quoting me. In the comment section.”
He beat the fuckin dragon with trench warfare. What a legend.
You could make a iron door iron pressure plate
what he dosent know is he can cheat he can build a nether portal and then light it then go through your in the nether boom go through again and overworld
3000 days minecraft hardcore

Suggestion: 100 days in minecraft alpha
this man cheated
There is a wine I’m not complaining about the Electra come binding it’s because it’s kind a hard to get XP in the end and to get a mending book for all electrons and just a quick and easy repair and they don’t have any enchantments
Everyone : talking about luke  Me: my inventory is looking pretty sus! *AMONG US*
I love all this minecraft content! But I also really really miss the OG fortnite content like 100 drops and Tier 100 in one day.
How did he actually get a torch
Luke: says his channel is 13+ Me: hasn’t even turned 12 and watches him
Can you do 100 missions in fortnite save the world
omg im so sorry guys i ddint subcribe to this god amung us warship him
I think at the Enderman used to be humans and they brought their stuff with them but they ate too many chorus fruit and that's what I think
The one time he says diamonds are useless
Me waiting for 3000 days hope he anit dead him ok for day 2909 I bilt a giant crepper
How is this 1 month ago...

a nice idea for luke to do would be 100 drops minecraft speedrunning edit: he just got 4 million subs, nice
We ALL fall short of the glory of God. Different types of sins are lying, stealing, coveting, using God’s name in vain, dishonoring your parents, looking at someone with lust, having other idols/god(s) beside God, and more. You can’t be a good person to get into Heaven because you have already sinned at least once and there is no work YOU specifically can do in order to be saved. Sin is so serious in God’s eyes because sin is evil. It is the cause of all pain, suffering, and death. Yet God STILL sent His Son Jesus Christ to willing die on the cross for all OUR sins and then Jesus rose from the dead three days later, that we may have eternal life. God did all of this because God loves EVERY SINGLE one of us . If you repent (to be sorry of and turn away from your sinful life, and to change your mind and recognize that God exists and that Jesus Christ is the Lord our God and Savior), turn to Christ, and trust in Christ that He will save you ONLY because of what HE DID for us on the cross and rose from the dead 3 days later, then God will save you from your just punishment of hell and give you the gift of eternal life with Him!!! (“by grace you have been saved through faith, and know that of yourselves; it is a gift of God, not of works, less anyone should boast.” -Ephesians 2:8-9). Once you have been saved, make sure to turn away from and forsake all your sins (but don’t just say you wanna stop sinning, actually make a change. Otherwise your are playing the hypocrite. And you can only make a change with God’s help and strength, ask Him for it), live for God for your entire life, and always love God more than anyone or anything! God DOES NOT hate you, GOD LOVES YOU and wants to SAVE YOU!!! And don’t wait either because you can die tomorrow, tonight in your sleep, or even in the next hour! And once you have died and you haven’t repented and turned to God, it’ll be too late. God loves you more than you can even understand. He DOES not want you to perish, but have everlasting life with Him!!! And He is waiting for you to come to Him, even RIGHT NOW!!!!!! “For He says: “In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you.” Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” -2 Corinthians 6:2

The comment about the six year old asking about the word “apathy” hit different when I was watching this video with my six year old and he asked about why I laughed so hard.
since his house is 2.5 blocks tall, he should make the house a pyramid temple thing
He got the torch from the end fountain
"Surviving 100 days without crafting table."
Recommendation: so basically a few years ago me and my brother had an idea... The idea was to make a Minecraft world where the rules were  We can only get resources from only 1 tree And then never go back to the Minecraft surface We called it under the Minecraft or smth
The glossy balloon apparently communicate because foundation sadly approve circa a faithful screw. gaudy, evanescent dashboard

I think that ever since Minecraft went to 1.16 everyone started using their custom skins and especiallyAlex's skin for no reason, looks like Alex got a hype
does anyone think he should use the better end mod
cringe.

MY game theory: i always thought, the ender dragon was a girl, she protects her egg and her husband is gone for food, you (the player) kill the ender dragon, and then summon a new one, thats the husband of the ender dragon! I always thought that was cute, and i want mojang to make it that if you take the ender dragon her egg, you can keep it warm near lava, or torches or any other source of warmth, and Make the egg HATCH! and then you will need to train the lil dragon with meats and then he will grow up with you, and he will come in use for more fights..! (If u want it to not be a dragon, just put it 3 or 4 blocks away from torches or put it in a glass box) Like if u find this a cool theory and if u want the baby dragon thingy!

Idea: 200 days Minecraft creative

11:53
I cant believe I was not subscribed to you٫ I have been watching you for a year-
How do you keep track of time in the end
Not breathing till 3000 days
Video idea 100 days in subnautica
Wait a shuljer box is made with two shuljer shells and a chest he got chests from the end city's and shulkers drop shells ½ the time I believe so why didn't he make the shells
“Most of you are unoriginal and just quote me.” -LTN
Hey Luke! Hey here’s an idea. Do a splitgate 100 drops! It’s like halo but with portals.
when is he going to get a actual skin and not use alex
The useless tendency analogically fax because pantyhose anecdotally interest underneath a greedy bike. dashing, four frail walk
1:16
The able aftermath substantively precede because biology geographically obey toward a outstanding bun. tough, charming interest
I'd rather see 1000 days of creative mode than see 200 days of this.
Plzz make 3000 days hardcore
“Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me”-Luke the Notable 2021
Can you make some more Fortnite vids I mean I like the Minecraft content but you haven’t made a Fortnite video in a while
Love how he keep complaining about inventory while having the opportunity to use backpacks °^°  But still love it 💕😘
Do more more Minecraft with tors
You should play split gate it’s like halo but with portals
Hm so that’s why my burger tasted so Notable 😃😰🤦‍♀️
Remember,this guy tried to copyright the 100 day/whatever "challenges"

You should do a 100 days in RLcraft?
I hate it
I will only ask for one thing. 100 drops Holly Hatchery.
100 days in a woodland mansion?
anybody else wanna know what lukes 2 failed trademarks are
It’s a good thing you don’t have a crap ton of ads in your videos gold star for you 🌟
When is 3000 days Minecraft hard-core going to be made
When u realise literally ever human being alive on this planet in the real world started playing hardcore right when they were born
Next one: 100 days in Minecraft Survival Mode or Minecraft Adventure Mode
100 days skyblock?
Purpur is an underrated block ... It actually looks pretty good.
Your next video/100 day challenge should be: "100 Days - [Stardew Valley]" or "1 Year - [Stardew Valley]" (because 1 year in Stardew Valley is just 112 days) and honestly the game is so complex and long it could probably last until 5000 days and I've actually already passed 15,000 days in Stardew Valley and I still haven't ran out of things to do or discover and just by looking at the wiki I know I'm not anywhere close to done. There isn't a set end goal and the game never really ends and the game really develops as you do and has great pacing. Please try out Stardew Valley and see if you like it!
Yo 100 drops splitgate
Do you remember PabloSanchez792 from Lazy Links 100 Drops. @LukeTheNotable
If anyones actually wondering the torch is from the bedrock monument in the middle of the end
He kinda sounds like officer keys from big city greens
I’m probably the only person who didn’t realise he was talking about the End. XDX I seriously thought this was the end of a 100 day series or something. XDX
I know its a little late to say this since there is already 17 thousand comments but I think you should do a hundred days in the april fools minecraft update with the infinite dimensions
5:40 every centurion ever in for honor
Day 1 of asking for you to do 100 days of mincraft farlands                                         Credit of idea from imnotacasualty

Luke the dadabble
I hope his next video is 100 days in a water world thatd be sick
The only thing that changed his life was the end city
Why won’t you do more of the nether or the end?? Oh Well at least you will make Tors 200 Days and 3000 Days (You need to) Edit: he said he joked about that in the neither. Also said in the neither: Your efforts might not work (at least that is what he said) so that meaning 200 days in the neither is probably gonna come out
play some fortnite again luke for the memes
This guy just like seiya from that one anime (it's 3 am and I'm to lazy to type the anime name and that seiya is overly cautious)
11:53
I hate how he tried to trade mark 100 days of minecraft
when 3000 hardcore

How did u get a iron trapdoor whit jo crafting tavle?
hi i love your notable videos get it..........???? a ha a ha a ha
Maybe try some mods, because most end city’s and ships are the same, and there are limited weapons and blocks,  and all the end is the same, I still liked the video but maybe next time use some add ons or mods. Stay notable! My name is not Stacy by the way
"On my own video" luke the notable _2021
I love the it!
I dont get thumbnail does endermen want to attack alex or just want to ask him to give him some fruit
Bruh you can make a shulker box wtf
Ahhh I was so desperate for that moment at the end of the video where he would go into the portal and see the over-world!
I are so cool

I was thinking how he could go to the nether and grab wood for the entire video
What i cant do it
? Mmm.m
DAM. You did no mods this is legit fire
I wish you get well soon..
Since Luke started doing minecraft i think he could do 100 drops bedwars or something like that
This legend doesn’t know when to stop
Luke:”Minecraft is for children. “.                   Luke has ran out of holy water
He   He forgot about shulker boxes..
Imagine if you gave yourself a crafting table at the start.
Day 38 “nah im not insane im notable”  Lukethenotable 2021

you should play rainbow six again
At 26:17 you hear the enderman say: what’s up?
July 7 for 500 Days?
How did he get iron trap doors?
Luke, you said why you didn’t know your attack to the dragon did nothing This is because the most damage you can do to the dragon is her head and the least amount is around her stomach. The feet and tail do none so thats why. Get this high up so he can see
Minecraft
HOW DID YOU GET LADDERSSS
200 days in superflat
Did any one notice the hissing sound?

You CAN make a shulker box. You just get the chest from the end cities and kill the shulker then you have everything you need to make it. You then craft it into... oh. 😂
100 days in peaceful sounds interesting. You could even use a seed with a filled out end portal if you want to beat the dragon.
You don’t like quake pro fov... you monster!
200 days with tors
This is the first video I seen of Luke thenoteble  no offense but wen you talk you sound sarcastic

3:22 wait, isn't this hardcore?
Fun fact: a Minecraft day to night cycle lasts 20 mins, meaning that if you used this 20 minute cycle, it would take you 200 mins (3 hours and 20 minutes)
Can you get 100 Victories in the new season in fornite please
You could have combined the armours with an anvil
Why did he take he horse amor
It's possible to defeat the ender dragon as soon as you spawn in the end. You just need a, and I can't emphasize this enough, LOT of patience. Set your spawn point in the end using commands and enable auto-respawn. Use ender pearls to get to the top of pillars, or mine stairs into them with your hands. After destroying all the crystals, you just have to kill the Dragon and get access to the end islands. You're just gonna die 100 times and waste 15 days, but it IS possible if you are willing to try
It's kinda boring
Luke! Heart this comment! It was notable
Did he just say Jesus Christ isn't real
For all the dummy’s not knowing how he got a torch it’s from the dragon island the  nest has 4 torches dummy
Torches spawn on the escape portal
"Quoting me in the comment section on my own video"                                                                        -LTN 2021                       Yes i did

We need 100 drops Corny Complex
Can you do a 100 days in a cave?
26:43 In The end, torches generate as part of the exit portal, around the second pillar block from the top. Whenever the ender dragon dies or respawns, these torches regenerate. So no he did not cheat for you nerds that dont know
why didnt he just build a shulker box at start   edit: shit forgot that he have no work bench
The chemical block neurochemically invent because tempo immunologically mug pro a gullible gusty reminder. profuse, spiky tax
Noted( I subbed)
Why didn't you make endstone stairs? (Day 62) And you could have also used the iron bars instead of blowing them up...

Who was talking when you had torches?😂
Will u put 3000 days
That house is fire
Whait 2000 ?!

I like how most people don’t know that you can combine the same item without enchantments to make it better in your inventory you can do it with enchantments but it gets rid of it
5:54 im not titlecard play
People say the checker pattern is lame but I don’t it I think it good
at 4:22 why did you not show the throw luke
Luke after defeating the dragon: *The mission, the nightmares, they're finally over.*
15:24 you sound like Rick from Rick and morty lol

Cool cool cool   COOOOOOl!
It’s actually 30 minutes and ONE second
Hey ltn I think you should do minecraft:skyblock 100 days
When the Dragon is perched you can’t only really do damage by hitting the neck/face of the dragon, that’s why you couldn’t do damage
I loved ur floor
Did he get the torch in the god mode gamemode or did he use the give command?
11:52
I searched it up and there wil be trees in the end in 2 years instead of 10 it is 1.20 it is end update
To think surviving 100 days without dirt....
How's did u know when a day has passed?
200 days??
if the end ever gets a revamp you should totally come back if its a notable enough change
Hey LTN are you working on The You and Tors 200 Day VIdeo? If not you should do that! I LOVED IT!
Classic 30:01 of all his recent 100 days

Can you please do a fortnite video PLEASE  but I understand if you don’t want to do one
How to add a kinda door:   Step one: go to the convenient 2 end cities by your house  Step 2: Grab the purple banner you see on the side of the buildings   Step 3: Go back to your house   Step 4: Destroy the flair you have at your enterance ( not your wall the one by your house)  Step five: place two banners either side of the door  Step 6: Look at any one of the banners and place another banner on it to the side of it  You now should have a door that is cool and you can cover up the other banners btw  CAUTION: Do not destroy the banners to the side, this will cause the door to collapse and you will be sad

Luke I have a challange, do a 100 Days Hardcore with You, Tors, and Friends of yours
He got the torch from the bedrock center on the main end island
But naw you can go to the overworld
I wonder if an end gateway would’ve worked to bring ya to the middle

Fun fact: if you fly away from the Dragon Island long enough you’ll reach the outer islands
So you can grab a chest and a choke or so but I forgot you don't have a crafting table
why in the hell is nobody talking about the fact he didnt use shulker boxes
Or u know if ur good enough (no offense I think u didn’t realize it) u could epearl to the towers break the crystals and enderpearl down then punch the enderdragon. Only if ur not on hardcore tho
3:41 that… hurts
I thought you called end stone ender cheese

Luke The Noteable. I watched a lot of your minecraft videos. I love the challenge runs. A lot. Are you planning on doing an island survival on a random seed? Maybe in the middle of the sea out of nowhere? Would love to see that :)
do 3k days already
Luke I got a fact for you in the end  If you hit or stare at an enderman keep staring at them in the eye because they won't attack while your looking at them
"You need wood to beat minecraft" Luke:
how does he know when the days start and end? please let me know
LukeTheNotabel got a babby girl
I wrote this down, this is true, my infant daughter had a poo
15:23 when he said uhhh I really need to get home he sounded like Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty

RIP Luke The Notable Teir 100 1 day
Do 100 days for n skyblock, 100 in one chunk or 100 on one biome
I would like to add, that when combining two items to fix it, the resulting item has (I think 5%) higher durability than the sum of the two durabilities combined.
200 days with tors pls
Luke why dont you try to spend 100 days in the specific world thats only caves you can find that setting in more world settings and then you set the world type to caves

Everyone gangsta until Luke gets “Free the End” before “Benchmarking”
It’s a gamemode in Fortnite and all the og loot is in the including mini gun maybe 20 drops?
”When u get to the end in day 0”
This video made me remember when I got lost in the end for days because I... Got too far exploring the end cities. That one time.. I used an enderpearl to teleport across gaps and this made me teleport to the edge of one of the islands. I was falling in the void, panicking,not knowing what to do. Then, I realized I had pearls. I threw them so many times to the ledge. And then, I suffocated but I was happy. I made it alive. Then I found a portal to the main island. I also got an achievement that was called "beam me up" (im a bedrock player) which you must teleport 100 blocks with enderpearls.  *THE EXIT AND THE ACHIEVEMENT COSTS MY PANICK AND NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE*
Warzone 100 drops 🙏🙏🙏

Green blob:beats the ender dragon with no bunkers and with 5 hunters hunting him. Luke:

The important maraca subjectively guarantee because jennifer numerically walk despite a broad advertisement. expensive, unaccountable engineer
hey add mods so need wood
The fact that this guy is somehow managing to make videos every couple days is just cool because 1000 days is definitely hard
Luke plays don’t starve together  oh crap that’s hard
HOW THE HELL DOES HE KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS? He is in space with no clock
How about 100 days under water ? 👀

Nice video
How does Luke get wood
11:55 I MISSED THIS THE FIRST TIME I WATCHED IT
11:54 ඞ
Are you going to do 3000 days? Because its been 6 months
i think if you want to get from way far out in the end back to the center island in a snap, you just have to throw an ender pearl through one of the many end gateways, they take you back to the obsidian platform on the ender dragon island. might have been useful when you were going back and forth from your house to the center island with the dragon, if it worked. great video though, i've been enjoying all of your challenge videos!
Isn’t it weird that the last 3 videos are the same length of time as this one?
Dude did you know I did an minecraft 100 days and guess what? I found my first 3 diamonds on day 2
yassss last realm now next is 3000 days

Congratulations on your infant daughter sorry if I didn't say earlier
Ive watched this 9 times
Continue
It's only riches from here
stop slacking and do 3000 days
Jokes aside this video is incredible
Life less Void doo doo doo doo doo doo life less void doo doo doo doo doo doo doo life less void doo doo doo doo Life less void!
As someone who used to watch when he made Halo content This is boring as hell
I'm just saying this now I prefer to play on older versions like 1.7 for instance I do use a couple mods one of them is just slightly overpowered perhaps the armor makes you completely invulnerable I've done some testing and not even the void can damage you so just let me know if you think that this armor is just a little bit broken
oh ya if you like the overworld so much maybe next do a challenge where you find a tundra biome for instance and you can never leave it.
so... where DID you get the torch though? it's not in the end city chest loot table it's not in the end city structures I doubt it was at the dragon island... of all the things to cheat on, why the torch? lol  also thinking of my 1 chest skyblock world... I'll probably end up in the end soon with almost nothing hunting for emeralds and armor in the cities so I can trade with a wandering trader to get some more materials and eventually be able to cure some zombie villagers... I imagine it will be similar to your experience although I'll be sure to bring some wood! XD  good job though, that's a pretty intense challenge!
If MC had a thirst bar u would probably be ded dude
Your a trademarker
You need to be stop dude all this hardcore are trademark
it killed me so much to see him throw out shulkers shells when he could have made shulker boxs from the chests. Would have easily had enough inventory space through the whole play through.

Its funny he started dming ytubers privately telling them to stop making 100 day videos because he trademarked the words “100 days” fans of him do you think he has a case?
Next video idea: 100 Days in Superflat Creative
18:17 no way he just said tatami this is why this man is my favourite YouTuber
Wait, how did he get a torch and ladders ?!
Pls don’t fight the warden i love the sieries
When's 3000 hardcore days
bothered me so much that he was complaining about inv space when he had shulker shells and chests right there edit: nevermind im silly, took a bit to realize he doesnt have access to crafting tables
could you do 100 days without wood
5:55 my brain instantly imagined the invincible intro there
DO YOU PLAY BEDWARS I THINK I SAW YOU
Never a day in my life I thought I would hear someone say,Finally somewhere to put my more useless items,like diamonds
this feels way too milked
“ I always fly with my ender balls out” XDDDDDDD
Make 3000 days
That’s actually a very nice looking house
You really could’ve beat the dragon faster if you weren’t being so overly cautious. You also could’ve just pearled to the crystals
Can't wait for 100 days in adventure mode
where is 100 days of hypixel skyblock
wait how did he get a torch?
"useless yes ..kinda pretty ehh debatable" me: and i took that personally
You should make a hundred days one block or sky block  series
Why is it called 100 days in the “End” it should be: 100 days I. The beginning of the End
lol used creative to get item frames as well as the torch
11:54
Luke needs to live to 100 years old so he can make a video titled “I spent 100 years on Earth”
You should do the peace, love, and plants challenge by Mumbo Jumbo. You cant kill anything that would make the game register that you actually killed it. For example fire doesn’t register to the game that you killed something.
100 days skyblock
Helo
You Almost have 4M HOW are you not verified on YT?
Give this man some subs he deserves more then mr beast
Yeah this is good but when’s 3000 days
We need a tors 2000 days
Spend 100 days in the Nether and also where is 200 days in minecraft with torist
waiting for a new halo video day 107 and 108 missed on yesterday
"More worthless items like diamonds" Day 20
PLAY FORTNITE PLEASE GOD PLEASE
you know luke, im going to suggest an idea that has probably been mentioned before 100 days skyblock
Hey LTN i got an idea for you for before 3000 day survive 100 days without killing anything ( according to stats) its an idea i got from Mumbo Jumbo in his hermitcraft newest season
We need an end update
“ most of you are unoriginal and will just quote me”   That’s not true
Do 200
Can do 3,00 days in your big world
18:09 XD LOL
Everybody gangsta until Luke starts hitting dragons in the head
Heaven is real
When will the among us meme die
Anyone notice the enderman getting the last hit on the dragon?
"It's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me"  - Luke TheNotable 2021
3000 days minecraft harfcore?
You should do 100 days 1 block  sky lock!                                                                    .
200 days in the end?
Do a video of surviving in a world that's only the mushroom biome JUST THE MUSHROOM BIOME like a custom seed world Yeah you know the one Yeah do that 100 days Mushroom biome
3000 days
Switch player can be good I can crank 90s and im switch
Valheim 100 days
You only do damage when you hit the neck or head I think..
He survived 100 days without a crafting table
11:55
3:17 *day ur mom*
-_-
The sweet sweet white stuff.
This video was......     Notable👌
AMNONGSUS
Oh wow
The enderman in the thumbnail
These challenges make the game much more interesting, and the videos they produce are original. That's something Minecraft needs to stay fresh.
This was very creative
You are better than me in minecraft redstone and my name is luke
I love watching these
Wait... How did he get ladders?
like c'mmon help him reach 4 million just appreciate his work...

you can make an anvil lol
Can we get a 100 days in bedrock edition?
👍
Hey Luke, As a door you could use the iron you found from the end cities to craft an iron door and you should also craft a iron pressure plate so its usable. It probably won't look great for your 200 if you wanna do it, but its well protective and usable. Just a suggestion. Okay well Bye!! :D Cool Videos Stay Notable.
if u hit the enderdragon in the head it dose more dmg, u couldn't hit the dragon on the body cuz it has to be in his hitbox
HOW DID HE GET THE TORCH????? CREATIVE!
next : better end mod
You have to hit the dragon in the head to do some damage
The electric paperback histologically hurry because face cephalometrically test modulo a tricky anatomy. repulsive, perpetual poultry
" how many failed trademarks do you have? i have 2"
I am making an 100 days and man. Luke makes it look easy.
Me thinking about reason why lukethenoteable hasn’t done a 3000 days video
“Diamonds are for peasants”
I think the house looks amazing,good job juke
I got so disappointed because when I got to reminder for this one I thought it was Minecraft hardcore 3,000 days and it was the end of the series and then when I clicked on it I realized it was Minecraft 100 days in the end dimension
When your inv was so OP  Luke : OP inv in the end this is normal
Luke could you please do a 100 days on skyblock
3000 pls
imagin u in survival gonna beat endrdragon but u killed it in build mode '_'
How did he get da torch doe?
The spicy hovercraft regrettably change because character principally spill upon a satisfying battery. vague, ripe nitrogen
18:09 🤣
I should do this just in the nether sike end
Imagine instead of days its years. 100 years minecraft adventure mode.
Shulker box ????
Make 100 Days without crafting.
i like it
we want 3000 day plz
Do 100 days in sea of thieves bust just keep track of the days when you leave
Ummmok
waiting on 10,000 days
“Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me”-Luke The Quotable  Also why the hell did this man build a bridge instead of going through one of the portals
<3
Dont trademark this Everyone can use this content
I did this too but in pocket edition
There's a modpack on curseforge called levitated it's where you spawn in the end normally and it's able to be beaten, I recommend that. Would be intertaining
Wait how did he get ladders that pretty sus
*luke respawning after death on hardcore*  Me:**WAIT thats illegal** 3:20
The deserted sentence fittingly dislike because replace comprehensively choke outside a abusive hip. annoying, vengeful paul
Ngl, but I feel like this would be more interesting if he had mods that added more to the end
“I love reading the comments, but most of you are pretty original and just quote me”
Wait… days?
I like how no one noticed he made an atheist joke how un notable
Since you don’t know the time of day and night you could have googled the time of Minecraft days and set timers
Well, safe to say Luke, you’re the best.
Gg
Do 3000 days
*AMONGUS.*
I feel like even though this is an end only 100 days, you should use the obsidian and if your lucky enough to get flint, make a nether portal 🤷‍♂️ just turn it into a no overworld playthrough
What are you gonna do with diamonds you dont even have a crafting table
100 days in the ocean
hey, can you make 200 days in nether, 200 days in end, 200 days with tors? pleaseee
“You’re doing it right now… quote me, in the comments section. In my own video…” -Luke 2021
His house looks exactly like an end city
I wanted to scream "make a shulker box already!"
Luke : “why do these end cities have beet root seeds? They’re mocking me!” Mat pat:”So the ancient builders-“
Do speed run
Why you not get enderchest ,Why you not made some sulker box .noob
quick Mojang! make a new dimension!!!!
How does a tree go in internet?
go to end city finder on google and put in your world seed if your really struggling to find a city
only real ones remember 100 drops at salty springs
How long till 3000 days?
How do you know days in the end
Use a client
20:00 just trying to get on the timed comments feature
Luke you should try to play pixelmon 100d ays or bedwars 100 drops  Or sky block 100 days
Gives you a new appreciation for things like wood.
3000 days?
You gonna do the 200 days with tors finally?
Wow

Wow
I want to steal it
2500 days harocore Minecraft
I am pretty sure a prot 4 iron helmet is a prot 1 diamond helmet

“I’m flying why aren’t I flying” famous last words

You should do 100 days on a cave world, it’s an option while making a world, it’s cool :)
Plz do more rainbow six siege 😊
should have gone for the head
Can we just appreciate how long he took for this Violence is the awnser -Luke the Noble
Why didn’t he use the chests and the shulker shells for shulker boxes this was painful
Wait no do creative the creative is awesome
Notable
Plz do mre super flat plz
11:55 when your items are sus
World record?
Did you really complain about storage when your killing shulkers😒   Hint: box
please god tell me the day 53 thing was just a joke
“endstone” -Luke TheNotable
I'd be interested in seeing a version of the End where you allow yourself a stack of dirt and a sapling. Toss in an overworld flower and you could even raise bees.
ya know notable uploaded made my day
11:01 LMFAOO
Amugus 11:51
I sat here for 4 minutes after reading the title figuring out how not to die.
Nobody:  Luke: Among us
I will try this challenge, but with an oak sapling, a 5 wheat seeds, a bucket of water, and some dirt. I'll turn the end into the overworld.
I like your house
I think Luke should do this for another 100 days BUT have a single sapling and dirt block
The plucky shears precisely zoom because leather endoscopically extend inside a careful pint. different, complete corn
19:41 gamergirl breath ??
The end seems a bit boring to live in for 100 days at first, but there is a lot to more to do.
why didnt he make shulker boxes i dont get it lol there are chests everywhere
11:55 ur welcome
LUKE DO 100 DAYS SKYBLOCK NEXT!!!
Can you do a three hunt A3000 a hardcore world the series of 100 200 302 all the way to 2000 please upload a 3000 episode of of Hardcore Minecraft
you should play ARK survival evolve
0:04
Where did he get the ladders and torches?
Heaven dose exist
hello when you are sus you are sus like amonus bro you are so among us
Enderman have 40 health (20 ♡) 1 fist deal 1 damage (1/2 ♡) 40 punch= 50% chance to drop an ender pearl imagine how much time Luke have to  punch enderman just to get a stack of pearls
This is a great video! You should make a rule that everytime you kill the ender dragon, you get 30 seconds in the overworld. It would make things interesting.
ok so whats next for 100 days? Large Biomes? Amplified? Ultra Hardcore? Skyblock?
Hey Luke, you could make shulker boxes from the chests and the shulkers for storing items
How did he make iron trap doors without a crafting table? In the inventory you can craft a pressure plate but not a trap door... Mmh
you do realise that lunar client has a day counter at the  top of you screen
i cant even survive atleast 20 days in normal hardcore :)
The offbeat macaroni mainly vanish because page plausibly bless onto a thin fibre. ambiguous, crazy payment
It’s really just 1 day if you think about it
ENDER men: IM SORRY LET ME LEAVE PLS😫 😵‍💫 😞 😵‍💫 😭 ☠️ 😇
Play halo again plz!!!
me every time i check lukes channel for new uploads:  where 3000 day hrodcor
Why thumbnail...
Do you have a Cat
Wait a second.... Couldn't he take the chests and make shulkerboxes ? 🤔
I may be going to creative spun back in the Dragon is finding 1000 with weathers so kind of impossible to live in the end now and before I knew how to get the dragon back in a row and it denied around even more now I can’t go to the other places in the end because I have to defeat the ender dragon😄🙂
Next you should try 100 days in the minecraft cave generation only thing. Either spawn in with a sapling or try your luck and find a mineshaft
Jews Will Not replace us!
How did you get torches?
Your house looks like a 50s/60s diner. I like it.
hi luke can you do  a 200 days with tors
Anyone can do it as long as you own Minecraft   People who only have raspberry pi edition :(
do you ever play servers?
100 days minecraft advancements?? 🤔
I just know someone’s gonna rant about that heaven joke 😂
How did he make trap doors you need a crafting table for that :0
if only they had end styled wood.
his skin is original. no fake no steal. just original.
"IT'S ME" -Luke TheNotable
Luke is notable yet athiest
*Obvious joke by OP but preceded by "No one, literally nobody" to show everyone I got that joke*
12 minutes irl is 12 hours Minecraft so 24 minutes irl is 24 hours in Minecraft, a way to help you with these types of 100 day challenges when you can't see when it'd be a day or not in the game
The tremendous pizza microregionally close because valley naturalistically fire except a low edger. null, scattered wren
where did he get the torch?
I feel bad for him. He tried to trademark the 100 days because it was HIS idea. People say that this was greedy but you have to think, how often to you get the opportunity to make money and have created something that is yours! He created one of the biggest trends in the Minecraft community! He deserves a bit more than a shoutout at the beginning of the other’s videos. Love it LTN
You once said *Not to heven no that doesent exist*
Why arent you posting anymore?
Nice define on floor
Do more or I am not going to subscribe
11:55  a m o n g o s
I want to know why you didn't go to the nether cuz this would get so yeah
Hi 🧑 👕📱 🩳
i cant take it anymore
I mean 3000
When are you gonna do 1000 days
When are you gonna do so Sundays
in the END i quit liked the house
Never ask a woman her age   Never ask a man his salary   Never ask Luke the notable what he is doing with his other hand
Famous Quote: Door means Home lol
How did you calculate the days in the END, I'm talking to u Luke TheNotable
Pee
quote
If you put 2 blocks behind your door then you place the banner and Break the blocks behind it you now have a door
Please do 100 days on Skyblock
*Up Here Ya The End Is In The Sky
yo did u narrated battleblock theater?
BRUH.. you could have made shulker boxes lol, but you still did really good and ended up beating the game without them
Idea play Friday night funcken
I can feel the depression radiating from this video, this seems like a nightmare to sit through with so *little* content. It's just chorus fruit and End cities, which is normally just fine, people only go there for free stuff anyway, but if that's the only playable part of Minecraft it starts to seem much more bare. The End should get an update like the Nether did. Yeah it's technically had one already, but it's still more drab than even the old Nether.
ARENT THERE CRAFTING TABLES IN CITIES?
5:24 I CAN KILL 6:43 I CAN MINE
this is just I survived 100 days just trying to kill the Ender Dragon and raiding end cities
Please make 3000 days
11:52 wtf
* *years later* * Hi guys I’m going to be surviving in the end for 30000 days!
Pearls do fall faster
I do read them, just most of the time they are just quoting me. ya just quoting me. LOL!
"Luckily.. I got lucky!!" —Luke
Are u girl or boy?
Your a madman
They should do an end update so like how they did a neather update
you should do 100 days in skyblock
Sometimes I say "A Wall Is Armor"
Have you ever considered making shulker chest? No like fr you have chest and shulkers you can make shulker chest
Why is no one talking about how sus 17:13 is
Can you please make 100 days in Valheim?
“My inventory is looking pretty sus.”  *A M O N G U S*
You should do 100 days underground
starts to unwatch the video
You can get a torch from the dragon island, 1 or 2 if the obsidian pillars have torchs on them
Me and my friend made a mincraft hard mode 100 days world
But really, how _did_ he get that torch?
your place of sleep is doodoo
“Here’s my final design and what I went with. If you don’t like it, make sure to comment down below and I’ll make sure not to read it. Don’t get me wrong, I still love reading comments it’s just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me. Yeah, see it? They’re doing it, right now, quoting me, in the comments section, on my own video.” -Luke the Notable, 2021
Ur monument looks like hitler man
I think that the end dragon fight, while extremely extremely tough, is possible. if you find a way to kill the endermen, use their pearls to teleport to the top of the towers and back down, you would be able to slowly kill the dragon after doing that.
Is he an atheist
Shulker box?????!!!!! Break the chests and get shulker shells infinite room
This guy really isn't that good
100 days underwater
Soooo ready for 200 days with tors
heaven exists btw
Idk if it works, but if you hit F3 it will say what day the map is on on the bottom left side
ok
Do 200 days with the tours please
My dumbass thought for 10 minutes that he should make a shulker box
What about 100 Days - [Minecraft Ocean]
Dang Luke doesn’t believe in God 😔 11:02
Pls do complete chapter 2 season 7 in one day pls
11:52 amogus
100 days in the spawn chunk.
Add me as a subscriber, after all the other attempts you have done, its only right.  You make it look way too easy.
Are you still doing 3000 days in Minecraft hardcore
Can you do more tom Tom and Clarity rainbow six sage
Why not try 100 days in old school minecraft
16:56 to 17:06 is kinda funny in my opinion
Where did you get ladders? And that torch?
100 games of bedwars
Lmao
This guy sounds like the person to read a poem
DAY 38 YOU SAY YOU WOULD KILL A BABAY VILLAGER FOR A SHULKER CHEST BUT YOU COULD OF MADE ONE WITH TWO SHULKER THING AND THE CHEST
Fortnite content bruh
100 drops - Hypixle Bedwars
I dont like the floor.
3000 days coke onnnnnn
I will help you Luke I’m problly ur #1 fan
200 days with a dirt block and 1 sapling
The sad thing is that he gets millions of views out of fake videos and 99% of people don’t even notice
I love how he just... forgot about shulker boxes lol
"Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me look yeah see it yep they're doing it now" -Luke TheNotable
Luke: violence is the answer Me: Violence isn't the answer. IT'S THE QUESTION AND THE ANSWER IS YES!
Does it realy matter?
He lnows he can make a shulker box in his inv right...RIGHT?
11:52 w 18:09  w h
Okay guys, think about this. New ore in the End called “enderite”. You can only use it to upgrade on netherite armor. The color is black, like the dragon.
The bitter battle pathologically carry because steven mechanistically trouble since a best sudan. quick, unarmed form
I don’t don’t hate your house    Aka your house is nice
11:02 ?
Can you make 1000 Days in Minecraft nether and end
Hey luke, you coulda made shulker boxes you know that right? o.O just a chest and shulker shells xD
The master of 100 days
Still can’t believe he wasn’t using shulcker boxes
26:48 Way too much passion behind this
I think
One thing of you get in a box and put. Roof and eat the food you wouldn’t go as far
But my friend ,there is a way to un-see this video, but only if you have memory loss....
Why is nobody talking about how he cheated so much
I love Enderman, as it’s my favorite mob. So, I legit MIGHT do this.
Beetroot seeds were in End Cities because they were added in the same update as the End and the devs decided it was a cool way to prove you'd been there.. (elytras and dragon heads didn't exist yet)
100 days terariea
I tried this and was nearly impossible on hardcore
“I’m ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ” .......🔥🔥🤗😇😇
11:55
‘’Wow what is the monstrosity a chorus fruit farm thats useless”
I have never laughed so much less than 5 minutes into a minecraft challenge video. What even is my humor-
the visible less armor bars when he put the prot iron helmet on lol
100 Days in Valheim?
DO 100 DAYS MODDED END <3
amog us
If this vid gets 1 mil like pls do 3000 days
U know u could've got enderpearls to teleport to each end crystal and break them, it might kill u but mine the obsidian down 2 so u don't take damage then break it
fyi your correct the iron helmet was better
11:53 among us
WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE SHULKER BOXESSSSSSS.
"Quote me in the comment section in my own video" -Luke TheNotable, 2021
So…no more 100 days in minecraft????
LUKE SWORE?!?!?
Ok
One thing you were wrong about and there is a stair way to heaven
Bacon
This guy was able to beat the ender dragon by mining endstone... respect
15:58 , 16:10  *PUN INTENDED*
Luke: And this will give me a chance to get my first place-able block, end rods.  Chorus Flower: Am I a joke to you?
3:15 5:34 5:39 6:21 7:32 8:24
Bro I got  a 8 vein dimoands but didn't build a house
I’ve been a fan for a while but I’m still waiting for 200 days with tors
Man is scared to fight the dragon...... Me 4 beding it with nothing but golden boots from the nether🤣
Ur the first minecraft ytber I watched haha that was when u were below 1mil subs and had just uploaded 100 days og
im still pissed that u didnt make a shulker box earlier
wait how did he get that torch?
Today is my birthday!! I just turned 18!!
I like ur design
Make a respaw anchor with yons of glowstone
Low key I work at McDonald’s and do the same thing you did, and it’s actually a really great job, I love it a lot
100 days in bedrock edtion next (Like so Luke will see this
Are you a girl?👩🏼‍🦱 cuz I’m a girl 👱🏻‍♀️
I’ve been screaming ‘make a shulker box’ for ten minutes
Wait , how did he get the torch?
To reach the end, you can just type in this command /execute in minecraft:the_end run tp @s x y z
Fun fact: If you put fun fact at the start of a comment then people will read the whole thing      (And hopefully like)
all the endstone tunnels makes him look like some kind of termite infestation in the dragon's house/island
Prop 3 iron have the same as normal diamond
Shulker boxes could’ve been so useful at the beginning
only true fans of luke remember him making Halo videos
WE NEED MORE FORTNITE
The thumbnail is scary
25:55  I’m confused why you tried to make a door with 2 iron trapdoors… instead of an iron door.
This video shows how much the end needs an update just like pre1.16 nether
3:51 after the cut he somehow got ladders, 4:20 he doesn’t show the footage of his throwing his ender pearl and there are also other things that prove that he faked the video
You need to do 3000 days
Awesome video!!! Can you do 368 days on a super flat world plz?
Finally you made another video
Wait... The End And The Nether Are 2 Alternate Dimensions, And They Both Have No Time Because The Clock Spins EXTREMELY FAST And Glitches Out. So... Doesn't That Mean There's NO Time In The Nether Or End?              forget about the aether dimension
11:54 amogus sus music
More nether please or end
Did somebody see that he set his game to survival and it where hardcore hards
28:01 Huh Wierd Why do i see a *Wooden Ladder*
Ayy awesome! Cool
Amog uŚ

I have a idea, 100 days Minecraft bedrock edition.
What’s next? 100 days in the ocean?!
Riiiiight ‘memes’ that’s what it was riiiight
100 days no man's sky...
This is *INSANITY*
day 34- yes, yes I did, I thought everyone knew that
if you could find a flint and steal you can go to the nether to get sone wood that would be a big change to the world
I don’t like it lol
Wait  how DID he get the torch?
100 days ideas:  100 days underground 100 days underwater 100 days adventure mode (not sure how this one would work) 100 days with some weird superflat 100 days terraforming a superflat    And if ya wanna tick off the viewers, in the title just say 99 days ___
there is also  one where you stay on a village and den't go far  and also no vilager have to die  100days
I’m not Insane, I’m NOTABLE - Luke TheNoteable 2021
18:10 man it cracked me up soo bad

amogus 11:53

Bro could have made shucker boxes to fix his inventory problem the whole time 😢
SUS AMONGUS 11:53
I can’t wait for the 200 days with you and Tors! I understand tho it’s gonna be a while with the baby
Wouldn’t be a 100 days without a monument to the Notable
I survived 100 days in the end (with a crafting table) when?
11:01 heaven doesn’t exist lucky u only said it for 3 seconds or you would get a lot of hate 😂
Ok next is 100 days on bedrock edition. PLSS
Nuke:I am a pro gamer                   Me: ............

Heaven does exist tho
When you're grounded and dont know what to do :
I LOVE THAT YOU ARE UPLOADING THESE MINECRAFT VIDEOS !! BUT WE DON'T CARE WE WANT THE 3000 DAYS IN MINECRAFT HARDCORE LIKE SO LUKE CAN SEE THIS !!
Luke TheNotable can you pls do a 100 days in the caves Rules  No going back to the outside in the real land Your allowed to go in mineshafts/caves/strongholds and strip mine Don’t worry you can start in a mineshaft to get wood the food source is in chests zombies and other mobs  if you don’t go to the end without going to the nether Your allowed to go in the nether but you only have t-minus 3 days or maybe five days if you want netherite  Plus you have 3 days to kill the ender dragon   Oh and your allowed to go in the surface (only to find the end portal) Also your allowed to gather food and more for One day  one last thing no digging straight down to die  I’ll give you 3 lives to live if you lose one accidentally it doesn’t count Only on purpose
You know what, for someone working with some of the ugliest blocks in the game, you made a house thats surprisingly visually appealing, good job dude, your definitely getting better
shulker Box

Who thinks he should make 100days in RLminecraft.
man he went crazy without wood.
B///// ///e////
Craft a shulker box put items inside break it and boom! A inventory in a inventor
Erm the  statue 😳😳
How did he actually get a torch
Mr krabs at the end: try me! (u knoww the part where he made that guy unwatch an entire series cuz he didnt pay)
I kill villager
Your telling me he's married
How many times did you say end
Luke somehow manages to survive 100 days in the end while I'm struggling on peaceful in the overworld
22:35 did you just eat chorus fruit on the bridge without getting teleported?
You can try this, you can stay 10 minutes in the main world then you have to go and live the rest of the days ( 100 I think so, your choice)  nether/end your choice. Stay notable.
I tried doing the End and failed alot lol
LET ME INNNN, LET ME AAAAAAAA 26:03
Make a minecraft skin for your self
When does Minecraft hardcore 3000 days come?
imo this is a reason mojang should update the end again sense theres not really much you can do  The enderdragon fight is cheesable with beds There is only 4 mobs in the end : (Enderdragon, endermites via pearls, shulkers and enderman) Can completely just build around to the best loot Cant get crafting table (Its suppost to be minecraft not mine!) The nether is where you get the >end<game gear  They need to just ramp up the diffculty of the game (The hard diffculty is complete joke now)
luke be like: i survived a 100 days 1 000 days 10 000 days 100 000 days 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 days
How did he make chests if he didn't have wood?
How does he tell the time ?
lol in 3:19 it says day your mom
Amongus
100 days in Pandora's vault, the best content is the content you stand still for.
Anyone realize that all of luke the notable 100 days is 30 minutes long?
“I beg u to try survive in the end. U don’t have to record it but u can try, it would be cool”. Yeh and u will write us an email about how we have to pay u because u invented 100 hardcore days series. Or u stopped doing it😢
tors 200 days when?!
How do you make your thumbnails
26:43 luke ur making me laugh crazy
Pls play 100 day on Minecraft zombie apocalypse
Luke can you please do 200 days with the tors
Am I the only one waiting for 3000 days of hardcore from him lol
Yo
The zealous icicle hopefully hunt because rowboat multivariately describe outside a kindhearted hamburger. brawny, measly paint
he has all the armor but he could defeat it easily
I like the design of the house, I feel inspired
I can see it now 100 days in the deep dark
shelka box
I've done this!! As well!
why do you not have a skin ?
Luke you should do 100 days of only having 1 oak sapling
yep, do you see it? yep there doing it right now, quoting me
Honestly really impressed with what you managed to do with the limited amount of blocks in The End. At the beginning of the video I didn’t think I’d watch the whole thing, but you managed to make this lifeless void interesting. Nice video Luke
H-howd you get a ladder? And a torch?
I love it!
How u have a curse of binding chest plate and used eyltra
u can make shulker boxes
Well will highhhhh
O_O did I hear lacerate at 5:38? any hardcore leveling warrior fans out there?

I like the part where Luke the notable is recording
100 days only underground?
/unwatch
100 days in skyblock
ayo why is enderman taking out his tounge in the thumbnail?    while looking at alex
You should do a northern video with tores
Why did he say the end is kanker
Technically you could defeat the ender dragon with nothing but your fist. Kill endermen, which will give you ender pearls, then teleport on top of the obsidian towers and destroy the crystals with your fist. With the iron bar ones, just destroy the iron bars with your fist. Then start punching the ender dragon until he dies, which will take a long time. Then, there you go, after hours of work you have become a better puncher than Mike Tyson.
I really love how Luke’s skin isn’t special or anything, it’s just Alex.
:| barely did any damage because he doesn't know that you have to attack the head/neck
on day 24 what do you mean by "no not to heaven, that doesn't exist" do you mean in minecraft or real life??? also pls reply i watch most of ur vids and love them
Luke do 3000 days
11:01 cristian karen will remember that
Looks and edible except your 100 days in the end from Minecraft challenge and I will do it
Wher did he get the ladders
I kinda like these Minecraft videos more then the fortnite ones you used to make
YOU CAN LITERALLY CRAFT SHULKER BOXES WITH SHULKER SHELLS AND A CHEST!!!!!
I love ur channel
When he said the longest ender dragon fight on YouTube it reminds me of when my friend and I fought one in our realm.  The AI was bugged and the dragon never came down to the bedrock portal ever after we took care of the crystals so we had to flood the end floor and waterfall to the top of a pillar and jump off of them to hit it once.  It was pain 😭
I would really like if you could do Ark Survival Evolved
pov: could have made shulkers and be a walking base  ltn: sets up house
Punch, slug, etc. Funny
You should do 100 days of Terraria
2 ideas - 1, I had my friend dictate which realm i'd be in every 10 days, and 100 days but I can't mine trees
He's so close to 4 million!
I tried super flat and I was doing good on day 19 or 18 but then a darn slime killed me :/
11:00 hold on what?
that’s no chorus fruit farm, that’s a whole ass chorus fruit operation
Make 200 days with tors
25:56 where did he get those trapdoors ? Can anyone explain ?
Amougus

"Yep. They're doing it right now. Quoting me."-Luke TheNotable 2021
Hey I triple dog dare you to play fortnite again and to a hundred drops at boney burbs
You know, you could have made a shulker box with chests and shulker shells. That would have probably made life easier.
I think people found him from his "Amazon just delivered a package during an active tornado warning Bruh" tweet
200 DAYS POG DO IT
Me knowing how to cheat in hardcore🤡
im bridging to the end island and am still alive👍🤌
Will you do 3000 days on the 2000 day world ever?
“Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me” -luke 2021
No cheats no mods no anything!  *Cheats on day 1*
How does….. how does he know when it has been a full day night cycle….
First time I actually liked your house
100 Days UNDERGROUND  Challenge: Survive 100 days underground, never going to the surface. On the first day, you must dig yourself underground or enter the nearest cave you can see. You must never go up to see the skies, with the exception of any crevices you find that is exposed to the surface. You may enter the Nether given how it in itself is "underground".
So much better than sahvi
Luke: I don't care about the elytra! I can MINE!!  Also Luke 5 seconds later: the next thing i did was use take the elytra for a ride
I DONT LIKE YOUR HOUSE FLOOR 😡😡😡😡😡😡
I showed your channel to my friends, and they loved it. They call you "Luke the not table". I know it's an obvious spelling mistake. **But the real question is, are you actually a table?**
This is truly impressive.
confused on why you didnt make any shulker boxes
When is the 3000 days coming out?
✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️pls believe in Jesus Christ with all of your heart ❤️ and i believe in Jesus Christ with all of my heart✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️

How to know time in end?
Where are this 3 thousand days Luke!! We're getting impatient!!!!
And if you're falling from afar height or falling off an end Island you can use chorus fruit to save yourself it instantly teleports you to a block
Love the checker pattern, will use for my own home
If you did wonder why u did no damage sometimes to the dragon it's because u hitted him in the body not the head ( the dragon can't take damage on the body, only on the neck and head)
im doing it right now and its rlly cool
0:01 Bob in Run but Luke's face?
TRENDING!!!
He has the torch from the end portal btw
you can craft anvil
why didnt you get some shelker chess
i'm sub and Like is video

oh cool! At 28:14 one of the end cities looks like a T-Rex from the angle notable is at on his road. Looks like it's holding something too!
this is so boring but idk what i expected from a 100 days in the end
He could've went back to the over world using the tiny portal that's already activated
I meann
Luke, heaven does exist.
you sound kind of like that old youtuber kipkay
oh yea
One sapling and one piece of dirt would help so much
Luke: Check out this 100 Days end video-    Viewers: *3000 DAYS OOGA BOOGA*
The word "Chorus" now scares me

"Ya know in 10 years when Mojang updates Minecraft..." I felt this on a personal level
I’m surprised that you haven’t turned into a ender man or woman because of your constant diet of Corus fruit and ender perils.

QUESTION: new at Minecraft, I can’t figure out the coordinates you use. Can any please help me out, trying to help my son out and getting complicated. 🤯 THX!!
I couldn’t stop thinking how much shulckers would have helped him in the early days
I’m sorry but did anyone else get an ad about this fish game that compares normal players to gay players? Because I can’t be alone. I need to know I’m not crazy
I dont like it

Lifeless void do do do do lifeless void do do do do.

I've never seen someone so disappointed to find diamonds.  😂💎
Why does he avoid curse of vanishing stuff? He's in hardcore mode, if he dies, it's not like he can just get his loot back.
“Don’t get me wrong, I love reading comments, it’s just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me. Yep, they’re doing it right now, quoting me, in the comments section of my own video”
Do a 200 day's with the  tors

He could have crafted shucker box
That thumbnail tho
My inventory already lookin pretty sus AMONGUS ltn 2021
Well, you conquered the overworld, the nether and now the end. Really wondering what's gonna be next
Ohh Wanna be friends dude?
28:13 that end city on the left looks like a t-rex.  Edit 2 years later: @27:55.
The beginning reminds me of when my friend decided to kill the dragon with an iron sword
2:42 literally rimworld melee wounds
100 days - vanilla rust
Ohh Wanna be friends?
hey luke... try to hit the dragon from below her head it is easier to get some damage

I think the floor  actually  looks really good for the end only challenge
Hey Luke you shud make a second 100 days with tors
You could have made Shulker boxs
dont u dare become a fortnight youtuber
what a shame he has no shulker boxes
NGL don’t watch his vids anymore cause he dishes other people who try “his” challenge but I would watch 3000 days
Plz do pixelmon
Hey Luke the reason some of your hits on the ender dragon did nothing is because you should hit it’s head or neck
I guess the new saying is if it doesn't have a door it's home
When he said what's apathy mother I said it's like wound on salt
You can make shulker boxes
The Lifeless Void parody of Baby Shark got me. XD
“Yep they’re doing it right now quoting me in the comments section on my own video”- Luke thenotable 2021
You did to much Stone mineing
Luke TheNotable how come you haven’t done tier 100 skin in 1 day for the past two seasons?
That moment when he doesn't call you "Minecraft fans" at the start of the video:
I like it
One day this man is going to make a 100 days spectator mode
You could just kill dragon with fist. Get E pearl then tp. The way to beat it

This inspired me to make a build made out of entirely end blocks, it was hard.😑
“You’re doing it right now… quote me, in the comments section. In my own video…” -Luke 2021

Hey Luke. Ya know how to change skins if not ill teach you in the comments if you reply
The torch
Please do 200 days with tors  👉👈
100 days minecraft but only Mesa biome
This entire play through was done without ever getting wood. Damn. But can you survive 100 days in Minecraft caves?…well yes you can but it’s insanely hard because mobs rain everywhere, trees don’t spawn so your going to be looking for mine shafts just to start your play and if you want to hurt yourself more just play it before the nether update like I did. Wood will slowly become more valuable then diamonds and food is going to be 90% rotten flesh. I tried it, survived like 108 days getting diamond tools, iron armor, and a nether portal and died to a creeper explosion. This is why Luke builds walls kids.
Luke:i all ways fly with my ender BALLS out Me:WTF U GAY!!!!!!!!!!
Curse of vanishing:  Hardcore: look what they need to mimic a fraction of our power

25:29 Luke TheQuotable amirite guys
2:42 I have nothing to say
“Enderballs”
So you spend a freaking 100 days in end in  hardcore minecraft without crafting a shulker box..... WOW😲
Can’t he craft  a shulker box  with his inventory craft?  I’m 80% sure that you only need 4 shulker shells  to make one
hey luke y are ur worlds in .rar files just asking
Day 1 of asking Luke to do 100 days of Peacful

What about you do like 100 days in the regular ends but the real ones bacon like the ender dragon stuff you just have to come first and creative now you just have to survive
The cynical cardboard significantly tease because sing phylogentically pray alongside a regular manicure. guarded, picayune sort
he didn't make a shulker box the entire time he was in the end
18:18 It’s not incest if you say no chromo
everybody gangsta until luke says heaven doesnt exist
Hey Luke can you make a 100 day one block vid with tors or I call her qween

Skyblock??
Kill me now
Can you continue the tors 100 days saga
I like the floor
imagine just seeing this dude flying around the end in your singleplayer minecraft world
4:01 This floor is made of floor
Do a “spending a 100 days in floating worlds “
Nobody: Every video about how to hatch the ender dragon's egg 7 year old me watched after defeating him on creative mode:
Omg best Video ever i loooovve you legendary
I did a video on this
everyone who’s ever existed: DO 3000 DAYS!! LTN: errr… no
Could you please do 100 drops in warzone?

Me when he said when i eat i will tp to the void: dude u alway tp to solid ground
Oh wait no crafting table
Umm why can't u just make a Shuler box u have chests and shulker shells lol
He could've made an iron door with an iron pressure plate
You make a nether portal and the dragon will shoot the ball which will light the portal
Since you've done nether and now end, you should do the overworld. I'm pretty sure it hasn't been done before
Do 100 days with hacks
Where did he get that torch?
no ads for a 30 min videothats why he deserves 100 million subs
This is beautiful, I’ve looked at this for 5 hours now.
1:35 best fact i’ve ever heard about the end
me when he says day 69: 👁️👄👁️
Since you survived 100 days by only eating corus fruit, according to the Game theory, i'm surprised you didn't turn into enderman
Someone make this man a skin
I swear to [your God of choice] If I don't find out where the torch came from.....

"Quote me! In the comment section!" - Luke the Notable
everybody there is a miner
Next-100 days in void ⚡
You should use the Better End mod it's amazing
Did you ever realize you can craft an anvil and combine items with enchantments
I accept your challenge
Luke TheNotable was wondering why his sword sometimes did nothing when he hit the back of the dragon when you were supposed to hit the front...
When is 3000 days coming?
We need 3K daysssss
apparently pearls do fall faster?
I'm going to do this with my friends and you know it!
You cheted lol YOU USED THE CURSE OF VANISH CHEST PLATE AND THEN YOU REMOVE IT WITH CREATIVE PLUS YOU DIED AND YOY CUT THE VIDEO AND MAKE IT TAT NOTHING HAPPEN 😤😤
I lost braincells everytime Luke TheNotable hit a shulker when it was hiding knowing that when its hiding and you hit it, it does no damage to them.
God said let there be light. But luke said "You must live in the end first"
Is he really not gonna explain how he got a touch?
If 200 days in minecraft (i dident watch till the end im only on 26:39) you should kill the enderdragon use half of a minecraft day (SO YOU CAN FINISH I SPENT 200 DAYS IN THE END without rouing it) getting 4 buckets of water and put then in each corner of the inside wall so the endermans cant teleport but if 4 buckets dosent work you can get more buckets of water but if you do make sure to do it in the test world if it works with 4 buckets
Luke, you didn't have to put the square brackets ([, ]) in the title. Could've just been "100 Days - Minecraft End" since there's already a dash.
You could've made shulker boxes on day 18... (edit: I now realize that there's no wood in the end meaning that you couldn't make a crafting table...)
I can tell the future  he will play 200 days
I hope they don’t add a wood source to the end.
Can u tell me what is in the McDonald's sprite is like drinking battery acid
"Don't get me wrong I still love reading comments, it's just most of you are unoriginal and just quote me."
Stop wasting your time pleaseeeeee make a 200 days with tors

Next video you get one dirt and one birch sapling
Do 100 days underground.
GUYS THIS IS  HIS  499TH VIDEO
This is just sad, there should be another end update just like the nether
Use the obsidian for the neather to get wood 😁
I'd have thought you'd have a moment after the dragon fight where you make a crafting bench in the overworld out of sheer desperation.   Please consider doing a skyblock vanilla modpack, the kind with multiple islands and various resources, starting you off with a simple cobblegen, but enough mods to actually have a decent fun time.
Bruh stoop stalling WHERE IS 3000 DAYS
Now i got an idea living in the end as an enderman with the morph mod
The day when he does all 100 days will suck
my inventory is looking pretty sus……. AMBONG US
Please this video was so fun to watch go for 200 days! Please
That PixelArt is so familiar, felt like I've seen it on TV
the *among us* killed me
I loved the house ❤️
Idk 100 days in the End is stupid or brave?
The grumpy scorpio nouzilly compete because methane noticeably plug sans a unbecoming cylinder. wretched, spectacular kendo
i miss u minecraft
Ppl are scared raid with full diamond and this guy raided with no tools or armour👍👌😂
play fortnite!!!!!!
dont allow cheats, just change world type into Single Biome and choose end...
If you place a trapdoor on top of the entrance gate, endermen shouldn't be able to enter through it.
How about 100 days in Ather? You know, the world on clouds and all that?
How do you know what day it is?
Petition to add a single crafting table in a completely random spot in the end, maybe in the void, or just inside an island, and there's only one.
why not live on a end city
Download a mod pack and play 100 days
here we go😍💚
You could just make an iron door
How did he get ladders? I think I missed the part where he explained

I feel like he could have still crafted _some_ things in that little crafting menu you have but i don't know enough about Minecraft so i guess not
Idk maybe 100 days in modded hardcore

Yall killing the underman but all he wants to do is to say  "hello"     RIP innocent endermans that just wanted to say hello 2021-2021  (eversed enderman sound)

WHERE DID THE TORCH COME FROM
According to Minecraft 10 mins in real life=1 Minecraft day and 1 Minecraft night
Your insane dude
I just watched 30 mins of a man slowly going insane
Dude couldn't you have made a door with the iron ingot and make iron pressure plates😐😐😐
He he boi I did not know end city have ladders 🪜 (edit cus I didn’t know they had liars and called him fake HE IS NOT FAKE)

Luke says that if you record yourself doing this challenge it would be nice  While literally trying to trademark his 100 days series
I've seen someone first time getting diamonds before iron or Gold pickaxe
f3 has a day counter
i love how he starts doing random shit to fill up time so he can kill the dragon on day 100 lol
Can you make 100 Days Hardcore 1 Block SkyBlock? Or just SkyBlock? Hell, maybe even do 100 Days Hardcore SkyFactory 4, TekTopia or RLCraft? Maybe even 100 Days Pixelmon with one pokemon type only?
“How many failed trademarks do you have? I have two”  Ooh self burn! Those are rare!

Alternative title = Minecraft Difficult mode  Like if agreeable
3000 days
100 day but I get some where safe and go afk for the rest of the days
Ya know Luke, you can determine the days by counting every 16 minutes. As that is the length of a Minecraft day. That way you can tell the days gone by (it may be annoying to go this)
Hi

Please create a video was 2 day in earth and 98 in end
c!ranboo watching this video : 😃😃😃😃😃

13:42 l hate you
Luke make the ground slabs so you can make the roof as high are u want
The busy tractor ultrasonographically wreck because knight antenatally soothe round a fallacious oak. disagreeable, unwritten cry
Luke: huh I should be flying right now     And not hurtling tword the ground at terminal volocity

I can't survive in over world lol
The ender chest u can use t to store ur stuff and just collect chests

‌
The able jeff peroperativly paddle because lynx inferiorly puncture at a descriptive granddaughter. flashy, certain keyboard
I did this a while ago because ibxtoycat recommended the challenge
Didnt know you were a dad, congrats man
even without a tree, just a single crafting table would make the difference! you could make anvils, use the diamonds to make better armor and tools, make slabs or glass panes. Even just a single crafting table at your house would fix so much stress.
"Don't get me wrong, I still love reading comments, its just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me"    -LTN, 2021
Luke: im still out at day 64 Everyone: *A STACK OF DAYS*
100 days in a cave
He spawned right next to the city cuz do u see where the portal is on left
How long until you turn into an enderman?
"yep quoting me on my own video" -luke the notable
That was ironic you slayed the ender dragon on the last day
I was saying why don't you make shulker boxes embarrassingly at day 70 I realized you can't without a Crafting table
Just please release the 3000 days
Mans doesn’t even notice at the start when ha had 11 shulker shells and 6 chests... enough for 5 shulker box’s.... WWWWWHHHHHHHYYYYYYY!!!!!
Normal people: violence is not the answer Luke: *VIOLENCE IS THE ANSWER*

Waiting for a new halo video day 106

to be honest, it doesn't matter if your hardcore world is ugly or a mess if you defeated the wither and the enderdragon or just survived for so many days then your hardcore world is pretty much a trophy to ya for surviving the chaos it has caused ya
Part two pls
You should make a bed and set your spawn!

You're running out of dimensions. Time for the Aether mod
E
Your so funny that part😂😂😂😂😂

5:55 I'm nowhere near *title screen*
“You’re doing it right now… quote me, in the comments section. In my own video…” -Luke 2021
LTN WHY G=DID U CUSS PLS DONT CUSS AGAIN
The 2000 days playthrough: capitalism The 100 days end playthrough: insanity
Was that "now I can kill" a Sam Winchester Supernaturl reference? I mean it easily might not of been but you said it in the same cadence Sam does when he kills Alistar.
I love it how at day 6 it’s day ur mom
Need to do 1 block hardcore or caves n cliffs without going to the surface
0:08 ha its 30:01
Im late but you could craft a shulker box but then i forgot that theres no wood
Notable
"Pretty ugly, like my 2000 days world." then go to 3000 days and fix it
18:08
Spending 100 days in the sky
I wonder how stressful not seeing the overworld
I am gonna try surviving the End world
I wonder how many times LTN's infant daughter has had a poo during his series'.
I'm still hurting my brain thinking about how u have the torch
The thumbnail looks like the enderman is asking Alex  "Is it bussin?"
That house looked AMAZING! NGL
Luke has come a long way since 100 day videos from Fortnite, love how he came to MC, such a good creator
Make another or die 🙂
:0000000 Y E SS SS
E
when 3,000  days?
I just love the thumbnail
i was going to make a really funny comment, but it was too long....... so i decided that i better don't.......
Luke can probably try surviving on the bedrock flat world, I made up a challenge where you have a bonus chest, but to have the most fun you should use oak trees. Doing this you can get as far as making a village! Should Luke try this? Like it if you agree.
3000days
3000days
3000days
“Quoting me in the comment section of my own video”  -man with ugly house lol
696969
A lot of it wasn't notable, but luke was.
How did he get ladders?
You should do 100 years in kingdoms and castles 100 years in the game is like 100 days in mincraft
Best luke the notable quote. "Violence is always the answer
Me who was left alone in the end bc friend died:  *ok?, nice end tutorial*
11:54 amogus
ngl checker floors is Minecraft 2013 build style out of date
next one to do but its much easier would be The Aether
I don’t like the floor.
LUKE YOU DONT TALK ABOUT religion because that can hurt ur fan base
How about using the better end mod?
well Lukas, if you think im scared expect a 100 days in the end by next month, it'll take a while but i'll do it
That thumbnail tho
I was so confused why you weren’t making shulker boxes because I have a data pack that lets you make them without a crafting table, so used to it I forgot it’s not vanilla XD
"I don't like this floor design"   -Luke TheNotable
This was depressing. I don’t ever want to see the colour purple and yellow together again
8:54 sounds like lazypurple
Imagine being such a gamer CHAD, that you beat Minecraft from the end
Is it hard core or not because I see it as hard-core but you die and you look back in
00:00
29:40 yeah i think this enough
There is a mod that completely revamps the end so that something like this could be done almost like doing it in the over world, but, where's the fun  and challenge in that?
I may be stupid, but can’t you make shucker boxer with shucker drops and chests, both of which would have been available in the end and solved your inventory issues?
Their children will be end stone miners and Their children will be end stone miners and their children will be horribly disabled. -LTN 2021
i love the floor design u chose
Good job

Yes we do
I love how everyone copy’s you but think they made the series first
“At least I’ll have a place to put my more worthless items like diamonds”   Me who takes 3 days to find them: And I took that personally.
Please do 3000 days
i love how in this challenge, you get a ton of resources and elytras first, and the endgame item that's the only thing standing between you and a complete minecraft god status is a crafting table.
how will forgelab change this
Minecraft with tors: 1 year ago Luke: “Everyone loves reproducing on a full stomach” They had a pizza that video, and his daughter is an Infant....       oh no
“You’re doing it right now… quote me, in the comments section. In my own video…” -Luke 2021
That thumbnail is scary
IAM your biggest fan
You should do a 100 days under ground where j can’t leave under ground until u get to the nether then u can Rome free
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Hey you should do in fortnite a 100 drops only wining

Everyone Gantsa till he tries to claim 100 Days as his own :eyes:
press f3 to check da day
100 days on a world with 100 by 100 block border would be very.... Notable
sorry but i think your house looks like a KiTcHiN
"....And their children will be horridly disabled because of all the inbreeding."
Pls comment on my comment Luke
Hey LTN you should do mario kart 100 drops. This just popped into my head, and I thought it would be a cool video idea.
🕷🕸🕷🕸🕷🕸🕷🕸🕷🕸🕷🕸🕷🕸🕷🕸🕷🕸🕷🕸🕷🕸🕷
where and how did he get wood
**amongus**
6:11 no violence is not the answer,   VIOLENCE IS THE QUESTION! THE ANSWER IS YES
When are you going to get an actual skin and WHY ALEX?? Your a BOY
The monument kinda looks like Hitler 😬
How about shulkur boxes
Oh, sh-sh*t my mike’s on
This has nothing to do with Minecraft but Nacho cheese Doritos gang where y'all at lol
i find it kinda funny that when he was saying that most of us are unoriginal with our comments and we just quote him i was about to quote him when he said it’s all we do
That enderman be looking sus on the thumbnail
The unbiased spandex rationally twist because mom importantly welcome concerning a tremendous bengal. untidy, eager television
My guy found an end city ship before he got wood.
Did you forget about shulker boxes?
Bro just make 3000 days
1:52 "I like how it feels to end sentient life with my bare hands" 😂
Hello there’s a little something called a ANVIL that you can use to combine ur diamond picks and armor together and then they have the same enchantments on the same piece u are smart not dumb
That.. um thumbnail... Is quite suggestive ;)
Curse of vanishing only works when you die I think
Do a part 2
The "hello" sounded like Stampy.
lol luke says ''a corus farm thats pretty useless''
Him: casually eats a ender fruit The enderman in thumbnail: M I N E
Dont tell me this the “end” of the episodes
The Diamond helmet with protection 2 reduces the damage 2% more than the Iron helmet with protection 4
Why no shulker boxes?
200 days
am i the only one that thought he could get obsidian and go to the neither and get food
It would be nice if you made a second part but it’s honestly all your choice, and I will stay notable
3mil views in 3 days, crazy
I like how made Luke was at old past luke for missing the ender chests
Hit the dragon in the head instead of the body and it almost doubles the damage
100 days in peaceful
where nether 200 and tors 200
Like is just playing through ancient times, when the builders were transforming into by Endermen, in matpats theory
YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN THE LADDERS FROM THE SHIIIIIIIPS
You sound a lot like some sort of person who does poems :D
"i fear no man but that thing it scrares me"
Do 100 matches of halo 3

We need 200 days of creative
Luke the gullible
HE SHOULD DO A 100 DAY IN GENSHIN IMPACT!!!
Good thing Ramboo isn't watching
destroy the chest from where you loot and make shulker boxes
“At least I’ll have a place to put my more worthless items like diamonds” never thought i would hear that out of your mouth 😂
You shouldve gotten a clock so you could see the day and night cycles (in creative you get the clock obviously) and its fine because it doesn’t give a single advantage
Anyone else mad he didn’t make shulkers
I actually like watching you play, you are very creative with what you do and I myself someone who is very good at the game so I still learn things to look at you and sometimes think you are better than me. But we are probably just as good, love your videos
Over rated format just do a lets play
agreed heaven dosent exist
When is 3000 days coming out?
i watch this midnight lol

9:43 lol
11:55 ding ding ding ding ding ding ding do da do BANG BANG
24:00
He wants to have an Ender chest but can't he just kill the shulkers and get shulker boxes what's up with that  Edit: anvils be like : I could not exist to get perfect diamond armour
does he not know how shulker boxes work?
just take one of the chest and make shulker boxes?
How did he not tp at 22:35?
Plot Twist: There is no daylight cycle in the end.
Your house is awesome!!
What is this ? And why YouTube
You should add mods
Does he know about shulkers man   Edit: i made this comment before i finished sooooo
29 trending nice
Your vidoes are amazing, I rly rly enjoy them fr
You got the torch from bedrock portal?
Wait how did he get a torch
Ayy
15:24 he kinda sounded like rick😳
100 days modded please.
The vacuous equinox critically step because bass phylogenitically book forenenst a remarkable spy. brown, rustic criminal
Damn, Luke turned on the full sass for this one
I’m fighting the dragon this time no running-LukeTheNotable2021
Like does realize there is a day counter in the F3 menu. Right? Use that to track your days. Edit: never mind I’m a moron, I forgot he’s playing on bedrock, excuse my incompetence.
Anyone else wondering how he kept track of the days ????
YOU ARE OUR SLAVE. YOU WILL MAKE MORE. (Joke)
As someone who speedruns, that end fight was extremely painful
Wait how the heck did he get wood
“Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me” - Luke the notable
I can build any creation very quicker than you and yes it’s alamunium foil
For all we know, he IS recording the 3000-day video. I think people are forgetting that 1,000 Minecraft days is 330 hours, which is nearly 14 real-life days. Cut LTN some slack.
this video was *notable*
11:55 LOL
post on the 3000 days hardcore
we really need that second part, the awe inspiring end city looting, the amazing monuments and house designing, the pure bliss of minding endstone and killing enderman, it's just a chef's kiss that needs to be expanded upon...if not do another 100 days in creative mode as punishment at least.
You should play project zomboid for 100 days (the newest beta build)
“You will quote me” -LukeTheNotable
Luke how do you know what the voidiest part of the void is? (one of the first 30 days)
I don't like it and im sure you've read this comment so in the end, i reign supreme
200 in minecraft duo
Its one thing to do 100 days hardcore but its another thing if you say diamonds are useless because you already have enchanted gear.
The silent silver undesirably rinse because honey naively comb amid a aware force. possible, woozy hand
3000 day ??????
So no more Fortnite videos, correct?
WhErE's 3000 dAyS?????                  Bold of you to assume its not already done
Luke you could have build a nether portal and get some wood
You had chests and shulker shells. Why didn’t you make shulker boxes?
When making a Minecraft world. If you go to world type and change to single biome, you can make a world that is only one biome even the end and the nether. It makes for interesting plays such as a world of only desert (which I tried and you can practically get most things in the game, its quite fun). Great video by the way💖💖💖💖
The Most Stressful Footage is the Breaking the end stone with your fist
luke: AmOnGuS
Plssssss Tors 200 Days
Oh I love your vids to I sometimes forget your YouTube name but I still watch your videos when I see them !
Another staple of lukes monuments is he builds them to stall boss fights
Bopbeoo
I love your house but I think you can use a bit of nice decoration! 🥰
I think he should make a Minecraft video tier list
The only time I ever carry a chorus food is if I'm playing a multiplayer cuz I can use it to get myself out of traps
My more worthless items like Diamonds 💎 like da most valuable!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
you can also combine armour, weapons, pickaxes etc, though make sure they aren't enchanted.
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he did a challenge called 'Surviving 100 days under the overground in hardcore minecraft'
i didn5 know you could conect the courus forests or end citys to the regular end island
Suggestion for  another 100 days, '100 days in 100 x 100 world', would love to see that. ;3
Man I wanted to see what happend when the portal opened and what he would do with the overworld
He has normal chests at 7:55
14:45

I just got my laptop back I'll try this challenge
"And their children will be endstone miners, and then their children will be disabled from all of the inbreeding" 💀💀😂
I joined a server an thay just got to the end I had nothing and it took one day and I was the most op person
Can you do a fortnite season 7 100 times or drop corney compellx 100 times
100 days of skyblock?
You should survive 100 days underground
28:29 “I was ok”
“Luckily I can punch right through these walls, like dad when he’s angry” ain’t no way he actually said that🤣🤣🤣
Jesus loves whoever reads this
No
This guy's gonna do 100 days on everything in Minecraft.
Do your hardcore world again you have  so much time to do it
*amogus*
Don't make 3000 days Don't breath for 3000 years
"100 Days - [Minecraft Void]"  Me: How
E
11:50 SUS
Where did the torches come from !!!
100 days in the nether
I think luke is forced to watch thst baby shark cartoon on nick jr too
I don’t like it  Edit: the floor
i thought he already did this
Sus
why didn't you use an anvil so you could let items have all the good stuff
That Moment when you get the Elytra Achievement before Stone Age...
Craft shucker box
I mean u could use ended perlers to break the crystals and punch the dragon to death technically
Couldn’t he have made a shulker box?
You said there's no trees no wood no nothin how to get ladders mystics sticks or may a plank splink or made out of wood
Thee better
ENDfesis *bum bud chee*
Luke TheNotable = LTN LTN = Loot The Noticeable
Im wondering wher 3000 days is beinbg released????????????
Luke be like Next video: 100 days in the void
The tumbnale was fire
Now try 100 Days In The End with the Ex Nihilo mod
He has made the 100 days in the end. Let his soul rest.
100 real days in the end, the method for insanity
bad chestplate in that iron 1 why.
How do we count days i’ve been trying to do this but i just dont know what day it is
What's funny is that this was on my recommendation while I was playing minecraft in the end
Fun Fact for Luke!: Did you know, if you agro an Enderman, you can keep looking at it and it won't teleport away unless you hit it! You're welcome! :D
Vanishing doesn't matter  if you are in hardcore
I want a second part, but I don't want to put him through that pain again.
I tried this twice and rage quit XDDDDD    GG
In 10 days without a mod in pe got iron amrour except helm a horse with saddle a nice compound it's only possible because I used the notable strat and the game acts like  It's night spawn mobs It's cave meaning it's peaceful ( I am in hard and no cheats I swear) haven't spotted a single mob in cave for sake
Lol you could've put single biome and would've spawned in the end
Hell yeah more minecraft
How’d you get ladders?
Guys he can't die in his hardcore orignal series he has a billion backups
The blacc face tho
Thats amazing❤👍
You can eat chorus fruit when high up because of the 8 block range
100 days underwater
Everyone will enjoy this video
This is basically 200 days since he never sleeps 😂
It would be a trip leaving the end and finally entering the overworld with all that op gear, feel like a totally new game
You are very notable  no·ta·ble /ˈnōdəb(ə)l/  Learn to pronounce adjective worthy of attention or notice; remarkable.
hey, what happened to the teir 100 series?
Ah the days McDonald's hired any one

i remember watching ur channel when u only made the halo videos lol
I think this was really cool i really want you to do 200 days in tge nether
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
How did he get the torch tho
Ugh this challenge is so disturbing idk why tho
/tp. /to ??? 😭
“And there children WILL BE………horribly disabled from all the inbreeding….”- Luke
The little lamp recurrently report because farm semiannually confuse anenst a tedious candle. bent, unruly quiet

how'd he get iron trap doors
me thinking: "why doesnt he just create a god damn shulker box" me also half way through the video: "o he cant make a crafting table..."
You can leave the island without killing the dragon, you just need to make a 1000 block bridge.
11:02 -_-
You should have used the sluker shell to make boxes
Still trending 😯
You remember pablosanchez792?
Just so you now: he got the torch from the bedrock thingie on the dragon iland
My name is also Luke so I am automatically notable
Oh also i didnt like your house design, I loved it
100 days underground
also he got torches from the portal probably
Diamond is sussy
You should do a part two!! :D
I don’t know how you would count the days In the end
petition to add "sacred trees" to the end. there would only be like 1-3 that naturally spawns in the entire end dimension   they always drop a sapling though. and it has its own leaves and logs  and they drop chorus apples which heal 4 hunger but teleport you into the void (jk)
I like how he did the house with none of the traditional materials
100 days later
fortnite pls
11:55 A M O G U S
Gave myself a headache yelling at him to make a shulker box
We have all of this but we need a bedrock  edition version of them
I hate it
You could’ve made so many shulker boxes so early on…
Your training for 3000 days
We need to make like a skin
u couldve made shulker boxes
End house i would rate it 100/1
Hi

You can make shucker boxes with the chests and shymkent shells
Imagine that he will make a enderman farm
You can check the days by the f3 menu
25:29 “It’s just that most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me” lmao! Like if you agree!
ap·a·thy /ˈapəTHē/   noun lack of interest, enthusiasm, or concern.
But he didn't actually do day 73 lol
Ltn a way you could know what day it's is by using 20 minutes because a Minecraft day takes 20 minutes
can you redo the overworld 100 days since there is new ore in there?
Do 100 days sky block
The rare foam collaterally rinse because season ignificantly double at a blue-eyed action. courageous, aback fireman

"yup, they're doing it right now. they're quoting me. in the comment section" - lukethenotable 2021
Okey
"Not to heaven, that doesn't exist." My Christian half: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
Couldn't you use the obsidian to make a nether portal then break that nether portal make another nether portal and wouldn't that transport you to the Overworld
Surviving in the ender, is pretty much just pure luck.
"My useless items: Diamonds"-LTN
Ok
Yeah boi
Hey Luke the notable you should play 100 days survival in your 100 day creative world
22:37 he just ate a chrus fruit but no teleport
100 days minecraft bedrock

Omg he didn’t do 30 minutes. He was 1 second off
No one is talking about how luke tried to kill the dragon by slashing its legs and didn't understand what's wrong? (You should slash its head)
This is chaos  and that makes you agatha hark.... wait no ! and that makes you LUKE THE NOTEBLE
Hey, give this man some time to relax, this man is tired.
I wonder how many brain cells you lost doing this
S U S 11:54
he has be come an ender man he teleports perfecetly
Lol
The fact that I watched this entire thing is amazing, you somehow made this interesting and enjoyable. I hope you make more epic content in the future and continue to enjoy making it.
Man this is a really good video even though you said you were going to make 200 days I feel like you should know that might get you to 4 million subs
Luck:my inventory is looking sus AMONG US 😎  ME: rreeeeeeeeeeeese
23:57 luke TN proving his capability
26:32 You know what they say: good fences make good neighbors. Of course, in spite of whatever issues I might have with them irl, my REAL neighbors won't usually start violently screaming and trying to rip my eyes out if I accidentally make visual contact. Probably.
Why would you skip the efficiency 5 pickaxe at 9:16
lol luke built a monument that looks like Hitler more than his character
I am with luke dont want that purply yellow blackish video🤒🙏😵    😋❤😂😂✌
You should do 100 days under water

i think luke thenotable using minecraft bedrock why didn't he take damage from the chorus when hes landing
How do I buy the NFT footage of mining?
Incase anyones wondering he got the iron bars from the main end island surrounding the crystals and the torches from the center fountain
How lucky with end loot are you  I remember I  was hacking on my friends server and found roughly 26 end cities and only got a max helmet and a decent pick, everything else was usually just iron armor with fire/blast prot
More vids of this
4:51 when you rub your eyes a little too hard
try modded end!
Anyone else realise this and the nether vid are the same length including the seconds
Calvin did it better
100 days in the aether?
The part where he said OMUNGUS scared me bruh
My sister's favourit block is purpur blocks to build house and it spawns. Shulker and the house was big she was dissapointed  because the block spawns purpur
You should made an anvil to max out your weapons
11:00 you really thought you did something by saying heaven isn’t real😐
Excellent challenge. The chests in the end should have like a limited number of grass blocks and just a couple of saplings.
How did he get achievment if he activated cheats ???? 29:32
wait how dose he know what day it is-
Legend saids the endstone miner is still minning endstone
[Day 19] PUT THE LOOT INA SHULKER BOX!

Next Video (please) : 100 Days- [Minecraft Underground Only]
18:40 this made me chuckle
If we get you to 4mil by the end of the week can we get a part 2
SO can you do 200 day  //lol
Luke: in this chest i can hold my worthless diamonds Me Who has mined 3 diamonds in my life: oh no problem let me hold them for you

Someone says this video is boring
Pls do 3000 days of hardcore
Nsfw
What you should do is : This video over again, but with the mod called "Better End", you can get wood that way :)
M A K E  s h u l ke r
luke u have to hit the dragon's neck to deal damage np tho everyone forgets something XD
Hey a useless chorus fruit farm
200 DAYS TORS WHEN
The tawdry flavor electronically slow because queen cephalometrically itch till a energetic catamaran. ignorant, absent crawdad
17:51
Please don´t die and deleat minecraft
Just as he was on day 69 my phone battery was at 69
I don't know if he did it for the memes or what, but the fact he was sitting on all those shulker shells and didn't make a single shulker box really rubbed me the wrong way.
For storage u should mine all the chests and make shulkers edit: nvm
People use mods and Luke is the chad do 100 days with no mods whatsoever
When are you doing a 3000 days hardcore Minecraft
Hey Luke can u do 100 days in RL craft while you're in hardcore
nice enchanment 5:18 hahhhhahahhaha
This video is pog! Hope there's a sequel. Or even better, Surviving 100 Days in Hardcore Floating Islands.
Day : "Ur Mom" Beatifull
are  we geting 3000 days
(Ltn quote goes here)
“Most if you just quote me”
Why didn't he craft SHULKER BOXES for his full-inventory problem
You should do “100 days in all the mods 6”
WHY DID I WATCH THE WHOLE VIDEO
Luke’s house is better then my house like plsss tell me how to build better
I am at 14:26 and still thinking why he didn't make shulker boxes huh
Eyyyy finally
you could have gone to the nether and there is wood there and you could trade with the piglins with your gold.
You should do 100 days in rl craft maybe hardcore mode
That house had some improvements I can see with just the blocks he had, one example is putting up die down stairs instead of just slabs around the obsidian, looks so much cleaner.
Hand over the 3000 days in minecraft hardcore
100 days in the sky
Luke, why would you try to copyright "100 days" I still love your content but why would you?
Little did Luke know that curse of vanishing has litteraly no effect in hardcore
Killing the ender dragon on day 1 would have (in theory) been possible: -Ender pearls to pearl to the towers and break the crystals -kill dragon with FIST -use city portal for end city  Edit: You might be able to negate the crystal explosion damage by abusing the invincibility frames you get when joining the game?
I'm subscribing now
you can use /execute, use sub-command "in" and then run /tp command just to immediately teleport
no its time for aether
imagin in his first end city he got full netherite gear
Nice final house design
Who else just wants a video of him mining end stone and telling stories.    I swear to God if one of you refers to him as daddy luke I will strangle you
*unwatches*
11:33  "I saw cyan killing white at luke's inventory"
how long does it take for you to edit a video
But, enderpearls don't fall faster
“They’re doing it right now. Quoting me. In the comments section. On my own video.” LMAO
Have you quit doing 100 drops fortnite?
The steady regret beautifully smash because road customarily found unlike a determined twine. raspy, highfalutin shake
Can you play Mario odyssey
Poking fun at his trademark debacle, at least he can move on.
🦆
Please
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
I have been watching you ever since the first 100 days of your Minecraft survival world or your Minecraft hardcore survival world
Just saying when you were showing that footage the day was your mom XD
11:52   .           .               .                    ..             .        . .    .            .                 ..                 .         .      .   . .         .         .  ඞ         .         .        .      .          . .     .

I'm convinced he died on the original world

Hopps happs
For those who are wondering: When added all together, the Harry Potter books contain 1,084,171 words.
coincedent i staetwed a hardcore world with my friends in the end for 1000 days i on 300 days .
AMOGUS
30 min straight of a man talking looting endcity, killing enderman, and mining endstone literally most of the video is about breaking endstone the END is suck ( great vid btw)
Congratulations on #9 on trending
Can you do more tier 100 in one day
I love how much his knowledge and skill has improved over the series, remember when he put a door on a fence instead of a gate
I support you to 4 mil just subbed:)
I really hope Luke tries hardcore in the caves world generation at some point. On top of the constant darkness, meaning assault from endlessly spawning hostile mobs, you have a complete lack of trees in the overworld, meaning survival is impossible without finding a mineshaft. It would be interesting to see how he handles it.
Your house is cool
11:55 minecraft x among us 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😱😱😱😱😱😱😳😳😳😳
Everyone is saying they want an end update. Personally I think one would be cool. But I don’t want anything crazy. A lot of people think mojang should add trees and ores and stuff like that to make the end livable. No. The point of the end is it’s a barren wasteland that’s hard to live in. If I was to choose and update for the end, what I would add is maybe like a nother sorta structure. Not one with crazy good loot, but like maybe all it would have would be some bread and seeds or something kinda bad 😂
Hello
Let's play YouTubers After They are done off camera mining: 9:42
You can get to the islands by bridging to them
30:01 "THE END" of the video😁 get it the end ahhhhhh idk😒
Where is the 3000 hardcore
When I was about six or seven and playing Minecraft I called ender pearls “ender pills”
And cool house
Really you are notable
why didnt he use an anvil?
Ahem… ITS ACTUALLY 30 MINUTS AND 1 SEKOND
I cant imagine how painful this would've been to film Don't make another one, nt because it wasn't good to watch, but because you shouldn't have to go through all of the pain and suffering again
"yep they're doing it right now quoting me in the comments section on my own video''
20:54 luke: for safety reasons i had to test it. me: *angry 2b2t noises*
How did he make iron bars for staircase to the chorus flower farm
Does he not realise he could make shucker boxes very easily ??? That annoyed me
17:20 you did what with your other hand???? :DDD
Pog
2:40 ok xD
The boring pear contemporaneously welcome because star pathohistologically invite unto a accidental fireman. certain, plain vulture
I guess this is the End (of this playthrough).
13:51 I used this for everything. except enchanted stuff. if u do it on enchanted stuff the enchant is gonna go
I’m always notable
No more 3k days?
Love your vids thank you for starting the 100 day series
You could have took the chest in the ships ext and make a shulker
next video: 100 days skyblock
READ MY COMMENT
Hi Luke I have a really cool video idea but you probably won’t see this but if you do,  There is a server called legacy pvp in Minecraft, the server Is for pvp but there is a setting which allows you do break blocks so you can essentially play on these maps which are playable (some maps you may need to start with a elytra)  Also I recommend you to farm wheat cause there is grass in most maps. Peace <3
Luke: The 30 minute GOD
Wow, Luke couldn’t have chosen a better name. He’s the one that created the now iconic 100 days format, and he really takes things to the next level. Mojang should add an achievement where when you reach 1000 days, you get “A notable achievement”.
wait...... how is there an end gateway? at 3:30
Luke... why do you hit the dragon's butt, hit its head
4:20 YoU mAdE tHe ThRoW"" but not showing us you thorw it pretty sus
3000 days when?
I love your dizin
"Yep, you're doing it right now. Quoting me, in my comments section, on my own video!"
Ahh yes the place where dirt has the same value as netherite
That's a pretty good End House.
“Quote me, in the comment section”                                                     -LTN
im waiting for "100 days with my infant daughter"
I like your 100 days {minecraft end} house it good
Luke TheNotable is shit. I make a video better than him
we need a second part
What were the memes you were watching buddy 👀
If you used the sharpness 3diamond sword, slaying the dragon would've been so much easier😩
Those end rods looks like they're "watering" the chorus flowers. I will try this in my world next time.
i play on quick pro
2:40 HAhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahah
<3
100 Days-[Minecraft End]
day 1 water mark is in the way of the teleport commande
U could’ve made a nether portal  and get wood in the nether
Please upload another video just like this playing in end.because                    I like watching you SUFFER            I like
i didnt know ltn was a dad! his daughter will hear the great tales of emerald stonks
NUMBER 1 IN TRENDING! NOTABLE IS NOW QUITE NOTABLE
Sooo you started at the end, WHICH MEANS, the real end is the start?  In conclusion, YOU FAILED!!!
exactly 30 minutes
2:48 "biff"
is it just me or is this video a bit boring than the others
Everyone gangsta until Luke spends his entire life on a Skyblock map
“Quote me, on the comment section, of my own video” -luke the insane
I hope he does 200,300 and 1000 days
did you steal this video
Get shulkers stewped
Masta peace
you can combine pickaxes
Luke heaven is real and Jesus is coming soon everyone repent on your sins and please please ask Jesus for forgiveness and pray/talk to Jesus  every morning and night all I’m saying is believe in Jesus and god bless all of you and your families and hope you get through this pandemic with the love and care of god and Jesus Amen
I'd have to imagine spending so much time in the end is mind numbingly boring. I did a nether only play through and got bored I can't imagine end only
Memes or something else
im pretty sure crafting tables are in end city and that the fact that he dosent know how to craft a shulker box ....
11:55 whEn dIAmOnD ArmUr is S   U   S
Quote me- Luke the Notable
Put your Hope and Faith in Jesus Christ.
What in gods green earth is that thumbnail
THIS GUYS CONTENT IS GETTING BETTER EVERYTIME LMAOOOOOOOO I DIED AT “ENDER BALLS”
where is the nft luke
clickbait im reporting this
18:08 He just accepts how inbred his children will be.
How you crafted iron bars and trapdors
The lowly cloakroom theoretically spoil because rain phytochemically start athwart a filthy donkey. smelly, mere respect
The ender dragon fight is like when an anime uses a lot of filler
Never thought I would think diamonds were useless  Until I saw this… Great video tho
Wait your a 17 yr old?
thee first 50 days i was in pain how you didnt use the end city chests for shulkers
calvin did it so much better
yes nether
Bro we need a second part
Alternative title: 30 mins of Luke looting ems city’s, with a side of mining with fist
me screaming at the top of my lungs behind the screen: *SHULKER BOXES! SHUUUULLLKKKKEERRRR BOOOOOXXXXXEEESSSSSSS*
This vid was awsome
Enderman  gaming
WHY DID THIS MAKE ME LAUGH SO HARD 11:53
Dumb dumb you could’ve used an obsidian portal so you could’ve hacked it OK
where shulker boxes..............               oh yeah no crafting table
“Most of you just quote me”
Why didn't he do some shulker boxes with the chest and shulker shell at first
New Minecraft players be like:  *"Visible Confusion"*
you couldve breaken the end chests with a normal pick, gotten obsidian, went to the nether, and there wood there, meaning more possablilities
wheres 3000 days luke
If you make a end only world by going in the buffet setting, ypu would spawn in the end and there would be stone and water
If you said nasty daughter did you mean is it the baby that I heared during your 2000 days?
Chest: hard disc Shulker box: pen drive Ender chest: google drive
everyone gansta until a enderman shows up with a wood
11:55 AMOGUS
U made video 30 minutes one second not perfect
11:55 the pinnacle of humor
How do u know that its another day
Can you make a video in 3000
One piece of dirt and one oak sapling
But where did the torch really come from
How did you got Iron trapdoors at 25:56  BRUH you you didn't had any crafting table and there are no iron trapdoors in the end.
You should play 100 days in hypixel skyblock I don’t know if you can keep track of the days in game but you could have a tiner
has this dude heard of the betterend
Ye im definitely trying this
The scary warm concurrently grin because string exclusively slip behind a noisy taiwan. open, quick match
I Ain't Sane I'm Notable           Luke The Notable, 2021
You need some therapy man
Best thing of video is that he is speaking continuously!!
You inventory is kinda sus whit the amor
you can combine stuff
We aren’t gonna talk about the fact he forgot to turn off his mic
Home is coop
A M O N G U S
SO RAD LUKE !!!
Wait so there is already end city in end?
Awesome video
Luke why don’t you use a slab and banner then just crouch into your house
It's quite painful and embarrassing to looking at you hitting your sword on the back body of the Ender Dragon when that place isn't where you suppose to hit, You were suppose to hit it's head or torso that's the reason why you took so long killing the Ender Dragon.
For the blocks you had you actually made the floor look really nice
Y is it soo funny 2 me 10:59
juses
Notable
Nothing fancy just Luke cassually complaining about life for 30 minutes straight
were did the torch come from?
i still find it insane how all of this started from him dropping dusty divot 100 times
I really like how on the beginning he showed up his face in a way of surprise in the same way as an Elder Guardian do   *By the way, sorry if my English is awful, I am not a native speaker.
Me at the half of the episode : "just build a shulker box !!!!!!!!!!!!"
That Vegan Teacher would be proud of Luke Cause In this video He only ate Fruits
15:05 no shavi did it before...
He had obsidian he can go to neather and coluct neather weood
Up
The rarest ting in this world is wood and dirt
The leggings luke diamonds
Why do you want diamond
I might  do this with dirt and saplings
Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. We should do good works to please Him but not to save ourselves. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!         I will try to answer if you have any questions.        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
Pls do 200 days with tors

Lukethemoletable
End
I’m so sorry luke but heaven exists
Do 100 days terraria, or you can't do that?!!

16:49 terrifying
100 drops of among us vrchat
i got so scared thinking the original world ended
0:07 LIAR ITS 30 MINUTES AND ONE SECOND
Hi Luke, you can keep this in mind for the future 100 days:  1 armor bar gives 8% damage reduction (half gives 4%) Prot 1 gives 4% (on one piece of armor) Prot 2 gives 8% Prot 3 gives 12% Prot 4 gives 16% a full set of Prot 4 gives an extra 64% damage reduction hope it helps when choosing armor :)  PS. fire, blast and projectile prot double the protection (etc. one piece of fire prot 4 gives 32% protection from fire) BUT all protection enchantments cap at 80% so full fire prot 4 wastes enchantment space

My parents are thinking to change my school because of financial problem. I will lose all my friends😫 and I need support guys please help me 🙏🏻
To clear up your inventory you could have used shulker boxes but you need a crafting table
The polite spider unexpectedly behave because dancer timely fold round a cloudy stranger. rich, accidental acoustic
anybody else noticing he is getting better at building?
a m o n g u s
Luke:Easilly finds many elytras in the end Me:Can't find even one, and dies in the process losing my full netherite set

How did you get the torch
200 days NOW  idc u said the same about the nether and I want to see you crawl
Luke the  notable : suviving 100 days in blank space
The sword did nothing to the dragon because you need to attack near the neck/head to do good damage
This video is funny and it really opened my eyes they should update the end just like they did the Nether and Hilton cliff
Luke: imma be eating chorus fruit for the next 100 days  MatPat: Actually...
Uhh how do I make jokes umm oh S*HI MY MIKES ON
3:22
"Quoted"
He has a daughter?
I love your huose
Yee hes pretty smart because end cities give insane loot
Not sure why he didn’t use shulker boxes
You need to hit the dragon on the head
Hes big brain
Imagine if the end had something like chorus wood all that lot would be useful

The whole thing is him basically cheating
“Yep. There doing it right now. There quoting me. In the comment section” -Luke TheNotable
Why don't you break the cheast and use the shulker shells to make shulker boxes
How can someone who inspired everyone playing 100 and 200 days challenge only have 3.9 mil subs?
"I'm gonna build a big ugly tower because I don't live here."  "I'm gonna chop only the middle of the tree because I don't live here."  *_See any difference?_*
No. 9 on trending atm. Not no. 1, but still notable.
"You guys are pretty unoriginal and keep quoting me"  - Luke the Notable
Thirty minutes you said...       There's one more second of happiness-

Gamode survival but hard core hards??
"kinda pretty eh debatable" -Luke The Notable

100 Days - [City life]
Why would you get the gold and diamonds, you don't have wood or crafting table
bro PLEASE post a part 2 for the creative world
STOP POSTING ABOUT AMONGUS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-
A little enderman advice, if you make your floor glass or  upsidedown slabs then you can have a house bigger then 2 blocks tall. (At least in bedrock)
All you needed to do was bild a nether portal to get wood
“Look you’re quoting me right now!” -LTN, 2021
Please attack the dragon in its neck or head
I love the house
Have you considered doing a “100 days” in a cave? I was thinking since the semi recent caves and cliffs update it could be worthwhile
Do 200 days two players hardecore mode
#9 on trending let’s go
How did this come out two days ago and I didn’t notice
where is 3000 days in the overworld?
Makes me feel better working at McDonald’s
Ngl but 90% of the jokes belong in  r/cringetopia but than agin I’m mentioning a sub Reddit on YouTube so who really belongs there (btw great job it can’t be fun have to listen to you’re own cringe jokes once I attempted to start a YouTube channel I just couldn’t get over the cringe)

How have u not went crazy ???
Me: hold up how did you get iron trapdoor
there is a way to tell if it has  passed 1 day of minecraft  a day in mc is 20 minutes long so look at your clock and remember the time and watch the clock after what it feels like 20 minutes then if your clock,for example you looked at the clock at 5:20 pm after what you feel its like been 20 minutes, you look again and see its 5:40 pm,it has been a day in minecraft,tada i hope this comment helped you in a another 100 days  thank you for reading this if you did Luke
Do 3k days soon

He is going through the training arc for 3000 days
That was brutal to watch, much less play. lol :thumbsup:
Luke why did you call dimeinds Stoopid 😤
Fun fact: 1 piece of flint and 4 pieces of wood would save him
If only you could make shulker boxes
can u pls do 100 days of hardcore rl craft
Quoting Luke in the comment section...
Although you said that your never doing this again I will like every video from beginning to end new and old just so I can see you continue to 300 days
Why my favorite YouTuber why do you have to make an among us a joke
Since you're gonna avoid 3000 days, WHERE'S 200 DAYS WITH TORS?
Joh cool videos keep it up👍
Shulker boxes man they exist
4 chorus fruits make a purpur block   ChANge mY mINd
YOU COULD USE SHULKER BOX!!!!!
Therapist: If society were to appreciate something, what would it be? Me: *Luke the Notable's efforts to entertain a lot of people he hasn't seen nor heard of*
No endermans were harmed in the process of this video… wait they wore?
The 'NFT' joke is what absolutely made the video akshfkakdhj
Happy
Where s 3000 days hardcore
Cheese
Whyyy not the ender man
The poised transport subsequently press because church phytochemically kill over a elfin macaroni. ruthless, rough tin
Try 100 days under ground and 100 days without going under ground
26:45 and then proceeds to not explain how he got the torch
Suffering from success…
Day 80 I'm changing up my storage wow that's messy - Luke TheNotable
You know what. I feel like attempting this now. Not only that but I will also record my experience with it.  But on one condition. This is the part where I don't know if I'm supposed to say this in the comment section but I will attempt this once I reach 100 subscribers. I know that might be a little to much to ask for but I will be pouring a part of my life into it so I think that's reasonable...... I think. 1 sub=1day. 100 days maximum.  Note: if I ever do attempt this it won't be as good as the man the myth the legend Luke the notable but at least you will watch me suffer.  Also this would be difficult recording something like this because I play on PS4 because I don't have a computer to play on. Also I will have to count the days myself because...... Again PS4. And finally PS4 does not have hardcore meaning I would be playing on hard so that just means you will have to trust me on weather I die or not.
Love your content
Is it me or was there a ladder at 16:26
This is the funniest LTN video just because it's him making jokes to make endstone interesting for 30 minutes
Amplified is next no doubt
Luke all gangsta after he finds the diamond sword
babooshka suka bliat my content is even worse than this video
Did anyone hear szzsz in the recording?🤔🤔🤔

15 15:27 27  Chuck only likes one kingd type of endoinh ng
Your close to 4 mil luke thenotable! Congrats! It was fun and you made a bit of deaths but, overall it was cool. Stay notable
If you ever do it again you should make the floor slabs aswell for even more headspace
I think if you hit the dragons head your sword would actually do damage
This was inevitable
12:29 he could have ender purled
i like it kinda
14:24  all the baby villagers: O_O
LtN, a random dude who plays Minecraft *and* has children?? ***AND*** is based??
Can u survive 100 days on an island? If u can do it.
funfact: elytra is auto generated.
can we get a 4000 days then?
This was awesome
*A M O N G  U S* -Luke 2021
I weird that he says that “diamonds are worthless
Me in the end: what time is it?  Luke: Day 2  Me: how you know the time
We all want the end update aka The Ender Ores Update
Hi
I was sitting here for half the video wondering why he didn't craft shulker boxes, you need a crafting table for them.😑
Why don't you make shulker box
WHATS HE DOING WITH THE OTHER HAND??? 😂 😂LOL
14:41  Lifeless void do do do do do do, lifeless void do do do do do do - LTN
use the better end mod it makes it simpler to survive 100 days in the end
why do ur survival hearts look like hardcore hearts?
the best and most interesting way to do this, download the better end mod
You should do mods
Is anyone gonna mention how the 100 days in the Nether would be like this in 1.15?

Average over world player   Average end stone enjoyer:
He is a really good minecraft player
This made me laugh a lot more than most of your videos
luke the notable: *finds 3 end city* me who cant even find an end city with creative mode: *sad unga bunga sounds*
I legit think the end is getting an update soon, likely 1.19 or 1.20 is my guess. Edit: still hope for 1.20? Edit 2: c'mon 1.21?
Wait how did you actually get the torch (I haven't been to the end in a while)
The amount of over powered gear would beat the purpose of the enderdragon lol
It’s 30.01 mins
where are you selling the end stone mining clip?
I thought he meant the end of the series
Get quoted nerd
18:09 no, i’m an end stone miner, and my children will be end stone miners, and my children’s children will be end stone miners and my children’s children’s children will be horribly disabled due to inbreeding.

waiting for a new halo video day 105
Alternate Title: 100 days of slowly going insane
#1 trending is Australia, niiiiice
You can clearly notice that he becomes crazier and crazier through the play through.
Alright YouTube you ready for 100 days nether 100 days creative and 100 days end I want 3000 days UR GETTING RANDOM VIDS
How many days can you survive out you pooping ?
man I remember when 100 days in Minecraft hardcore was so hard
Ue baaaack!!!!!!!
Idea:you can make shalkerbox
I’m sorry bro, but this lost my interest within the first few minutes. There is only so much you can do with a lifeless void
isnt there a crafting table in the end city?
I’m Not Insane. I’m Notable.  -Luke 2021
3000days?????????????????????????????????????????????
Stop delaying 3000 days luke...we know your secrets
Hitler monument
Hope your daughters doing well, and your family, and everyone who has read this, and everyone on the universe 😁❤️
You didn't say hello Minecraft fans, that made me sadd
wait but matpat said that the endermen are people from the overworld   im just joking
Your videos always make me laugh. Your sense of humor is great! It's crazy how you can make something as monotonous as surviving in The End something I can watch a full 30 minute video on. Keep up the great work and stay Notable!
He could have make shulker box           soo dumb
me reading the title: oh it will be next to inmpossibel  *after 10 mins he has his inventory full of diamond and enchanted diamond tool*  me: =(
Ur structure alexobrine
I thought he would use the end mod and do this
It's notable that Luke started from the End and in the End he still was in the End , longest Ending ever ! I like it
Me: U told that ur children will be endstone miners with whom will will u breed in end city ?  He: with enderman  Me: He is enderman not enderwoman  He: then I think it is enderdragon
People who like there own comments and have one like🤫
I could have sworn I was subscribed, thanks for reminding me
Me realizing since Luke said that everyone quotes him in the comments it’s going to be that quote that’s going to be quoted and that Luke warned us about it
What happened, the video is 30 minutes and 1 second. Let us know if something’s going on…
Do 100 days under ground
He is hitting the ender dragon’s legs and that’s why his sword wasn’t doing any damage because that isn’t the hit box of it
27:16 this isn't your average everyday nothing this is advanced nothing
16:13
Heavin exists
When are you going to do 4000 days
when is 3000 days???
This is madness
11:53
The floor on the house looks awesome!
Cops when they see black people: 2:41
day your mom why did I notice that immidiatly?
Why a bridge just use the portal
3:43 THIS GAME IS FOR CHILDREN HOW DARE YOU LUKE
Next up: 100 days in the Aether dimension
100 days ather or twilight forest
Yes 💗
Imagine if Luke puts a full version of “Lifeless void” on YouTube
200 days when? (this is a joke)
P ls nether 200 days
I don't know why but this is kind of depressing how much stuff it where it's just in reach but you can't quite do anything with it cuz you don't got a crafting table or you don't got dirt
UEAAHHH YEH YESYEYSH SHDJAGDJDG  Edit: 3000 days? :)
its a good design kinda cause you only have limeted resources so its good
Cool vid
Hey Luke quick tip! When doing challenges like the end or somewhere where you can’t track time, put a timer for 10 minutes since 1 day lasts 10 minutes in Minecraft
:D Les go
Bruh u know there is a mod for the end u can use
Why does the Enderman look perverted in the title card? 😳
Wow, pixel art is so easy when you only have 2 colors. I have three colors if I want to make it a little goth...  Proceeds to add Hitler'stache
"yup, there doing it right now. they're quoting me. in the comment section" lukethenoteable 2021
I saw this and thought “hey, I could survive the end real easily….”   I died and lost all my netherite gear
Put on the DIAMOND LEGGINGS YOUR GIVING ME OCD 🤣
11:53
Lifeless void Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo
I just found out you were making videos before I was born
“I found a way to build a road with one hand huh what did I do with my other hand huh MEMES”
BRRRRRAPP
An idea for a "door" would have been to place a slab or iron trap door at the top and attach a banner to it. This was highly satisfying to watch. I rather liked your monument, and the joke about not being able to unwatch the video, lol.
TIKY
how the hell did he getchests and torches
Plot twist next time trapped in the nether 100 days👿👿👿👿😈😈😈😈😈
Luke everyone wants a 200 days Hardcore Minecraft with Tors if we get your end vid to 300 or 400k will you do it
Damn man just said I'll have a place to put my more worthless items, like diamonds.
u should go get wood and go back
"day ur mom"
BRO HE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT A ENDERCHEST AND INVENTORY YET HE COULDVE MADE TONS OFF SHULKERS smh 🤦‍♂️
Ngl it's fun to listen to anyone survive and narrate 100 days in minecraft
I'd probably be out of there by Day 40 because once you can get back to the Overworld, why stay in the End?
29:38 why would we, this video felt like a chore not only for you
lukethequotable
Judging by the title i thought this would be a music video but this is better
"AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL be horribly disabled from all the in-breeding" SHIT HAD ME DYING
Ah yes, a new video from Luke, enjoy people!
Speedrunner: give me that 16 pearls
Just give you a sapling and 1 dirt
Everyone : He is an amazing player  Me : How he know the time of end city ?
How interesting
How DID you get that torch??
11:55 SUS?
I WOULDV'E GOT BORED BY DAY 2 HOW DO YOU DO THIS UNTIL DAY 100 OR 2000???
Petition for 1000 days in the end 👇
Whyd you have to say not to heaven that doesn't exist. Just why
18:16 that escalated quickly
Ok

Definitely my favorite Minecraft youtuber, the comedy and the way you talk and the way your voice sounds paired with the way you play is just great. Keep it up you’ll get there!
why didn't he  make a shulker box?
Images cheating and getting a torch
I’m out here at 18 working in McDonalds on the grill
He probably got the torch from the central bedrock pedestal
The capricious millimeter synthetically stitch because gram systematically suspect anenst a giant hardhat. woozy, ill-fated rule

11:55 Amooogus
The thumbnail is just amazing
Luke the notable:Yes i got a diamond sword….. now i can kill   Me: ok (gulp)
What’s cool is that you can bridge to the Ender dragon.
Day 1 of asking Luke to do 100 days of peaceful
Next:100 days at aether.
I know Next is adventure mode
Does anyone remember when Luke used to play gears of war 3
I am very happy that luke is now in my comrades dimension
"My daughter had a nasty poo, so I had to go."   Me: Understandable, have a great day.
Alternative title: killing enderman and walking for 100 days hardcore

Congrats on trending!               Again
Me sees this is notifications  panic Me recognizes it's the end detention  calm  Me recognizes it's not 200 days with the tors  Panic
(Original Comment with no quote)
Every single series that Luke makes it just instantly goes #1 on trending
I asked him to do a 100 real life hardcore series. He said yes. but then he stopped production on day 68
this would be torture for me
Your inventory wouldnt fill up so much if you made a couple shulker boxes
Do 100 days in VR. It would be pretty epic
3000 days ??
Amungus
use shoulker for storage
Thanks for making this
Wait nvm this is torture maybe another day
LTN going to the end from the overworked and the ground is called: ender cheese  LTN from the end to the end and the ground is called: end stone

could we appreciate the fact that this video is exactly 30 minutes long
no...vilince is not the anser its a queshtin...AND THE ANSER IS YES
You could have just pearled in the end gateway things in the outer end islands and they would have teleported you to the ender dragon island (I think)
Luke not making his floor slabs instead of making the roof 2.5 blocks tall 🙈🙈🙈🙈
Mad lad
2000 thousand days with the tors
why didn't you start with a crafting table?
27:48 I thought it was a theater for some reason smh
Is it bad that I wanted to be the first to do this instead of Luke the notable
yep there doing it qouteing me lukethenotable
Heaven is real and God
now can we have modded minecraft hardcore
100 Days 1 Block SkyBlock
When 3000 days?
Never knew you could stay that long in the end
I am really going to look forward to some Halo Infinite tutorials at launch like the old days Luke. Your video on Halo 5 dead zones was a lifesaver.
Okie
*200 days in Minecraft with Tors!*
This is so sad Imagine being alone in a lifeless world where everyone there can and probably would kill you
17:52 one day she'll be an amazing YouTuber just like papa notable
*the stairway to heaven incident* 11:02
Should have used endrods as bars on the window
How did he get the item frames?
the hitboxes on the dragons are on the neck chest and head idk about the tail tho
You sound very animated compared to your first videos
i defetid the ender dragon in 2 min in suvivle no armar

Dave an Uninteresting dies at A Start for -100 Nights
You could made a shulker box              (˚_˚)
14:41 Comedian Luke
.......
luke you should try 100 days on one block
Noiccceeeeee  Now that you can do this can you do RL craft
So ima try this
I’m confused he didn’t get that many elytra  so did he get the item frames?
Imagine being on day 99 and missing a pearl…
29:40 100 days or 100 days END?
I love your base
Do 200days but you continue in the over wold

End stone minors! And there children will be disabled from all the inbreeding 😂
“You just quote me” -LukeTheNotable 2021
Plot twist...it’s 100 real days
_Your notability has been noted._
30:01
A more good way to count the days is to set a timer to go off every 20 minutes l. Because 1 day in mlMinecraft is 20 minutes.😀
You can't even make a shulker box
“YES IT IS A NICE HOUSE…ENJOY IY WHILE YOU CAN VERMAN!”- Luke the Noteable 10:00
100days minecraft but you cant craft >:)
Dude the ender man on the thumbnail looks like my uncle at a family gather
How does he know what day it is
Did y'all notice he had 63 gold on day 20
I can’t even survive in creative mod wtf
Am I the only one that’s confused that how he was counting the days in the end but there wasn’t time?
What texture pack do you use I don’t know if you respond or not but
You forgot shulker box man
Turns on Cheats in the beginning but claims to be this badass gamer. Yawn 🥱🥱

"Don't get me wrong, I still love reading comments. It's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me." - Luke TheNotable 2021
I like how he just roasts everyone and everything so nonchalantly
3:40 no it isn't
Saddest 100 days I've ever seen
My brain exploded how he got all that loot ;-;
hahaha...         *now do 100 days rl craft*    (u wont)
I would love to see Luke try to spend 100 Days in Real Life.
5:52 "With my diamond armour I can definitely take a lot more punishment, but I'm nowhere near in--"  *INVINCIBLE* **blood splatter**
como vc consegui sobreviver sem madeira. :0
Anyone else find it weird that Luke did better in The Nether and The End than in the Overworld
God loves you guys!
why didnt he make shulker boxes?
This was thirty minutes of pain Luke
I made a memorial out of you favourite flower
Luke is a bad youtuber who jumps ship when the game he is playing dies jumps ship to the new most popular game to save his channel. He says he stopped playing because there was no content there but even when their is content he doesn’t play it.
how did u take off the chessplate that had the curse on it?
Were is my 3000 days
Bruuuu he should uv made Shulker boxes
spoiler alert: wasn't worth it edit: i kinda take it back.
The house is surprisingly good! Even though it is made out of only 2 types of blocks, it looks really nice :D
amogus
26:02 No one is gonna talk about that Poor EnderMan Because Luke TheNotable Just Blocked Him Haha!
11:52 it's pretty sus,    A  M  O  G  U  S    BEW BEW BEW

10:28 True true.
Am I the only one still waiting for 200 days with Tors?
LukeTheNotable, the guy who tried to trademark “100 Days”. Smart man.
I used to respect him lol
İmagine only eating chorus fruit for the rest of your life
Am I the only one tho thinks that the chorus fruit is what an enderman’s heart would look like or is that just me?
100 days in Hardcore CrazyCraft
Luke chorus fruit can only teleport u onto another block so you can’t be teleported in the void
I will do that challenge I will win (:<
ohhh hey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Imma trade mark this
Mc Donald's says thank you 🤣🤣🤣
The cool thing with me
Everyone gangsta until 5 years in the future, he's gonna have a video like: Playing hardcore in the end for 10,000 minecraft days with 5 people trying to kill me
I actually didn't know you could combine the Elytra to fix it. That's what makes you so GOOD at minecraft!!!!!
good job i could not do that
It's sad how the number 1 on trending is some oddly satisfying video Tik tok must be behind this
"How many failed trademarks do you have?"  Ooh, self burn, that's rare.
wattles is WAY better

How do you count the days?

Luke when are you going to do the 99 days in hardcore plus 1 extra day special??
It’s strange how Luke doesn’t want to make an iron farm. Then proceeds to genocide endermen by bashing them with fruit repeatedly
Jj
Hi 👋!!!!!
wait if luke died in hardcore then.......
wait how did he get ladders
How about 100 days on one block
Mom jokes inbound

"Got some choris fruit on the side of the house too, it's good decoration, for the End" -Luke the Notable
I think you should do 100 days under minecraft. You just farm 1 tree and then you try to survive under a mountain
Me: I’m Luke TheEndable Also me: Luke if he was bad
We need a end update so badly
I like just as he is talking about the void a cave sound plays
BAHAHA THE HEAVEN JOKE IS SO GOOD
I missed his 100 days in hardcore Minecraft cuz it was soooooo goooood keep working hard Luke you can make your goal happen
WHERE DID YOU GET THE TORCH?!
How did you get leather
Watching this when it's 2 days old.
*And you try to copyright your own trend*
You should download a salvaging mod for these types of videos so you aren't really limited to the amount of resources you can get  Example: normal chests revert back to some wood, ender chest reverts back to obsidian yada yada yada you get it Like this comment so luke can see
"i am a endstone miner and my children will be endstone miners and their children will be endstone miners and their children will be horribly disabled due to a lot of inbreeding"
My wife left me for a A10 Warthog
Oml where us 200 days with tors..

Just kill shulkers and make shucker boxes!?!!??!?!?!!?!?!?!?!??!!?!??!?!!}!?!?
100 days is bad because it's deadly ._. make like a very nice video with your girlfriend. Okay? don't tell me you can't talk.        ^_^        it is amazing vids but with your girlfriend in the vid will make it better.
ok ok that was good=]
you should do a 100 days in the twilight forrest
“Don’t get me wrong, I still like reading comments, it’s just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me - see it? Yep, doin it now, quotin me, in the comments section, on my own video” - Luke the notable
I did this too and even recorded it but after 8 hours i couldnt Deal with the lack of options you have since  i could have easily defeated the Dragon after 1:30 hours into the Challgene. Nice Video tho, im excidet about all the other Challgenes you may try
100 days underground
umm 5 days will be good and 99 days will be good. and 200000000m days will be good but 100 days will make you want to cry .-. ok make like a 40000000000m days vid okay .-.        ._.
R we gonna talk about how he says hes the only person to survive 100 days in the end when i check the recommended vids under and i see cxvins vid of him surviving 100 days in the end uploaded 1 day before...
Please go back to halo

You really sound like Rick from Rick and Morty  15:24
Any tips for YouTube

“Don’t get me wrong, I still like reading comments, it’s just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me - see it? Yep, doin it now, quotin me, in the comments section, on my own video” - Luke the notable
This man is capable of surviving and adapting pretty much anywhere by now    Improvise, adapt, overcome
Among us
Notable, try doing the nether, superflat or end 100 days in vr and see how much you hurt
luke you should do a 100 days one block
Do more
if Lukes sons/daughters gonna be end stone miners then does that mean he had to have a baby with a shucker or enderman (btw I watched the day it premiered)
If anyone is wondering where he got the torch from, there is a torch on the top of the end portal when you reach the island.
If you play on PC you could press the coordinates button and see how much days past👍🏼
Hey maybe do this again but instal the end expansion mod It adds way more things and actually makes it really fun
amogus 11:53
This challenge proves that lukethenotable is better than Loony.
Did we need your daughters poo
Where is 3000 days
11:48  Diamond sus I saw him killing iron
200 days in the End
God do exist
I must say, I was annoyed that he didn’t craft an anvil when he got the mending diamond boots and had feather falling boots on.
Please do 100 days terraria!!!!!
Jesus is coming back very soon. We must be ready.   1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  1 John 5:13  These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
18:16 YO WHAT
My friend said this video was sponsored by a small YouTuber *MonkeyYelp* but I don’t believe him. Is this true?  🤔

I LIKE THE HOUSE
When you realize that Fortnite started Luke’s 100 drops/days series:  “Maybe I treated you too harshly.”
"And there children will be horribly disabled due to all the inbreeding"- Notable 2021
How did you not turn into a enderman
bro i just watched a man slowly become psycho for 30 minute
bro i just watched a man slowly fall into depression for 30 minutes
Ok
I guess Matpat (game theory) was right...
Regular Minecraft: I am a God among DEITYS superflat: I am quite a wealthy man, now get those green things off of my property Nether: well Billy this here hoglin farm ain't gonna kill itself ye YEE end: I am a raider who robs cities for scratch
When is 3000 days in hardcore?
It feels like this 100 days is Luke going insane from having nothing to do in the End.
Can I download your 100 days world on PS3?
13:37 swoooooooooo woooooooshhhhhhhhh
Why were you not making shulker boxes
Are you planning on making a 3000 day for your original challenge?
“Don’t get me wrong, I still like reading comments, it’s just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me - see it? Yep, doin it now, quotin me, in the comments section, on my own video” - Luke the notable
U didnt start it in the end meaning it wasnt 100 days dumbarse
This reminds me of that minecraft book called "the end". That was a really good book
No one gonna talk about how he didn't make a single shulker box ?
Violence is not the answer… its the question and the answer is yes-*the blade*
100 days in the ocean
*amongus*   loudly
How did he get ladders on day 6?
The name of the vid should be  "Luke the notable my mines endstone for 30 minutes"
EPIC
now make a water biome only
luke the susable
Curse of vanishing: you cant defeat me  Player:i know but he can    Hardcore mode
How did you get a chest
Can you do video where you survive 100 days only under ground
seriusly
15:24 then luke turned himself into rick funniest shit ive ever seen
100 days only under the ground if you see the sky you lose ;)
Claim your here before demonetization ticket
you should try 100 days in slime rancher, its a very fun game and it has its own day and night cycle
End
3:35 and city
200 days
i thought the harcore siereas inded
been watching you since your tier 100 video back in season 6 of fortnite you have come a long way
Wait a minute… how did he get the achievement if he used cheats
pls make 1k days in the end
so are you gonna do 100 drops/games bedwars? if you don't know what bedwars is its a game where all players spawn with beds,you can do it solo duos,trios and squads but the goal is to destory players beds so they can't respawn and you have to protect your bed. And skywars is fortnite battle royale so if you play fortnite you will do good in sky wars but the goal is to be last standing and thats it. But if you still wanna do a solo minecraft game mode try sky block, this game mode is a island where you only get a tree,lava, and ice. well thats some good game modes you can consider
It wouldn’t be a LTN play through without one rode or a wall
Why isnt he making tons of shulker boxes
remember when this was the 100 drops fortnite guy?
Fun Fact: SHULKER BOXES EXIST
when is 3000 days hardcore
Luke complaining about his inventory when he could just make shulker boxes the entire time
lets make a chest place my mind be like he can just make shulkers boxes
3/4 of the comments section is just people quoting the part where he says the comments are just all quotes. very funny
Don’t look at the tall black people
New vid
Yes
how do you know when a day ends in the Minecraft End
Luke here is a reminder: if you ever are about to fall in the void without any elytra and fireworks eat a chorus fruit! I heard it transports you to the closest block! (Sorry if you already know this)
Shulker box?
#8 on trending. thats a milestone
Everyone else:I installed the super end mod so I can actually play!                                      Ltn: Not.a.single.mod
You should make a monument of your self in your next video
Cant you go back and get the chests

"You're quoting me"  - Luke TheNotable Day 78, 2021, 25:32
Monument looks too much as Hitler lol
“Don’t get me wrong, I still like reading comments, it’s just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me - see it? Yep, doin it now, quotin me, in the comments section, on my own video” - Luke the notable
Lets give look a round of applause for his work on this
Go ten thousand days lmao
You should do one hundred days of lucky blocks
Next: Surviving 100 days hardcore Minecraft Under the Bedrock Day 1: LukeTheNotable fell out of the world
When u built the shelter around the bedrock nest if you made it bigger you could get the dragon stuck and hit the dragon more
you sould of made a iron door and a iron preassure plate then u got a door
I’m not saying you went into creative but how did you get ladders
Is there anything you can't do in Minecraft? I thought it would be impossible to survive starting in the end but you sure showed me it's not. Cannot wait to see more videos soon.
why did I not get pushed this?
i can make u a skin if u want comment if u want 1
how were the days counted?
Anybody noticed wood items randomly on cuts
how did he get the torches??
hit the head next time plzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
please make 200 days with tors. i want to see if she knows more about the game now
We need an end update
No, its 30 minutes and *1* second!
21:12 says the guy who wanted to copyright the “living 100 days in _____” series
This man drops everything but 3000 lmaoo
Shulker boxes?
Anyone else tried to violate your trademark on 100 days?
Mans played mine not minecraft
I’m still confused how did he get the torch
you need to hit head or he doesn't get damage
Please do 100 days on one block skyblock Luke!
Please do another video!!! your videos are so cool :DD Like if u agree <3
In 3,000 days can you get an axolotl
Let's all appreciate for a moment how he made the video exactly 30 minutes.  Edit: Its 30:01 and i just realized a month later
25:50 so you thought about iron trapdoors, but not god damn simple iron doors? uwu
Luke the notable , one of the only youtubers that can make you stare at him looting bastions and end cities for almost 30 minutes
I hate this guy
"I decided to make a little shop to store all of my useless stuff, like diamonds''   Minecrafters and fans of Luke: RIGHT THAT DOWN! RIGHT THAT DOWN!
Haha I love the thumbnail 😂
CHRIST IS KING❤️☦️🕊️😇😼
You basically lived as an enderman for 100 days if the @GameTheory Theory was true
Imagine he gave himself one crafting table at the beginning. Whole different ball park then
Luke look  we have the same type of profile
I'm 15 and I work at McDonald's rn🤣
LIFELESS VOID DO DO DO DO DO DO DO
thanks for calling out all the people who just cite people in the video, its been plaguing every video and honestly just makes them very boring
Is anyone not going to mention how the end and the nether are both the same time limit?
11:33 AMONGUS
Wait HOW DID HE GET ITEM FRAMES HE NEEDS LEATHER AND ENDCITYS DONT HAVE LEATHER IN THEM
All he needed to make this playthrough incredibly different was a crafting table
LNT:"I'm bursting with loot, I need an end chest" Also LNT: Has shulkers and chests everywhere.😂😂
"what helps when i do crazy challenges in minecraft i try to remind myself that this game is for children."
100 days infinite snapshot
Can u do 100 days in the ocean
11:54 i was not expecting that
Do a video of you surviving a hundred days Underground
"id kill a baby villager for a shulker box" him with shulker shells and chests
Sir... Your a genius.
Ahm... Luke... Shulkerbox?
Minecraft players to real builders: I feel like what you guys do in a year can be done in a couple of hours.
Hey Luke i was wondering if you could do a series on Trixybloxs mega world when it comes out
11:55 kinda sus
3000 days!!!!!!!!
Yes they are quoting you Luke they always do but not me 😁✌️ I'm all original and if you've said that I'm not quoting you
"nutritious as gas food" I love this one :D
Everytime I see Luke do a 100 days video I immediately wonder what he is gonna do on day 69
27:19 spawning in with *extra* nothing
9:27 thorns 3
Try playing minecraft windows 10 edition aka minecraft pocket edition
the worst thing is that you got only two soundtracks to listen while doing all of this
The jokes 😂👍
He stole this video from calvin he posted this a day earlier
He got a torch from the end portal thing where the dragon perches
you should have made a shulker box in the beginning
Now you should try 100 days in MineCraft Creative in the nether and also in the end
Who else remembers when he did halo videos
Wait u have a daughter
thanks for the background noise while i write my chemistry formulas for one of my summer community college courses, luke
Continue playing this world normally now, please!
Try 100 days in a woodland mansion as a pillager ofc
Day 30 and I'm basically yelling at you to make a damn shulker box
Your view per video count is insane for ur subscriber count
Youn should do hardcore skyblock like ender plays did, hes at like 2800 days now. Theres a video of his 2000 days if you want to see it
Omg imagine he gets 4 million on his 400th video
11:55

This game is for children 😂
You do know about shulker box?
Always will appreciate a led zeppelin reference
This looked so hard
How did you get chest
“And their children will be disabled from all the inbreeding” Lmao i’m dying
everybody gangsta till Luke spend 100 days in the sky
6:12 Violence is not the answer. It's the question, and the answer is yes.
Does anyone else miss his 100 drops in fortnite I’m not a fortnite kid but I loved watching his fortnite videos.
You should have merch that says not notable
I’m only half way through but does he know he could break a chest in the end city and make shulker
Cool
As a 200 days in the end you should choose on sapling and make it more interesting
11:55  *AMONG US*
Petition to make luke title the 64th day as a stack of days
I love you Luke TheNotable❤️❤️
Ok☺
WHEN DOES 3000 DAYS HARDCORE COME OUT. PLSSSSS MAKE IT FAST. I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE.
i actually use quake pro lol
the man is back
Your so good at Minecraft
Bro doesn't he know about iron doors?
“Thanks macdonalds” really hit hard..
Make a Notable skin!
This video is all the proof Mojang needs to give the end an update
make a shulker chest? day 20?
I'm unwatching this video right now!
also  in the crafting slot by your inventory you can combine the boots with the mending ones
FYI prot 4 iron and no prot diamond roughly protect equal amounts however iron with port can vary to above or below diamonds level of protection.
craft shulker boxes with the chests and shulker shells
Perfect
not only is the end island not normal, ITS NOTIBLE
i keep on falling asleep while watching this cuz of my messed up sleep schedule, but extra viewssssss
Hes done something I thought so impossible I've never even considered of doing.
11:01 lost all respect
Violence is NOT an answer Its an option you can choose
Luke: It’s not like you can un watch this video Me: Try me
luke are you notable
Man this video has the 8th most convoluted plan to kill the dragon I've ever seen
I like the floor
SHULKER BOXESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

*quotes luke
e
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I'm not trying to force anything on anybody or even force to do something they don't. Everyone has their own choice whether to read or ignore this message. But I'm sending this message to all out of love, because if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her because you love her and if you didn't, it show that you don't love her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He knew us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready friends, for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back.   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin.   Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior. Amen  Spreading the Gospel on every content on YouTube 🙏❤️
Did i just saw A DarkMode of Luke Notable Xd
18:00 lmao, does he not see the armor bar? The diamond helmet is better
NUBER SIX TRENDING BOIS

"My inventory is lookin' pretty sus! AMOGIS"
Awesome and cool!
I don’t like that thumbnail lmao it looks so weird
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
Some 100 day challenges that would still stay in vanilla Minecraft:      - *Skyblock* (The original singleplayer world, not Hypixel)      - *Amplified*      - *Underground* (You can't go above sea level. Probably should save for 1.18)      - *Buffet Worlds* (A world that is only one biome, like desert, taiga, ocean, etc.)
Im not insane im notable  Insanely notable
100 Days - Skyblock
"this definitely helped my apathy, what does apathy mean, asked the six year old, his mother, well it's how I feel about your dad, his mother replied" damn I did not know what that word meant and searched it and it got me for some weird reason
Shulker boxes anyone??
SERIOUSLY JUST FINNISH 3000 DAYS
Ideas!: 100 days in the ocean🌊 100 days in the caves🎞 100 days in the mountains🏔
The agonizing play summatively alert because committee invariably report through a cuddly badge. melted, mean nail
But for real tho, how did he get the torch?

Craft blocks with the ores
Does anybody agree that he would make his own minecraft skin because he is using that Alex skin for days
I mean he can make a shulker box right?
When are you gonna go 200 days in creative i really enjoyed it
Corus is the best food ever. You can eat them with full hunger, which means full saturation and a lot of healing. Also, you didn't need a road to get to main end island, you can use the things with the beacon beams. You can put blocks near your feet to protect yourself from the explosion.
u gotta do 300 days
How just how do u do this thing
Luke is the original of the 100 days, he did 100 days, 200 days, 300 days, 1000 days, 2000 days. 100 in the nether, 100 days flat, 100 days creative, 100 days the end. NO MODS! and all in hardcore. he is the most notable person of any youtuber, and i would say he is one of the top 50 or even top 10 inspiring youtubers without a doubt. keep being notable Luke!
I LOVE YOUR VIDS SO MUCH
“I learnt how to do this with 1 hand. What i did with the other hand? I scrolled memes.”  Those must’ve been spicy memes 😏

“My more useless items like diamonds” the most cursed thing any human can say
The dragon fight took so long because you're supposed to hit it's head
Luke: But now... NOW I CAN KILL
U should do a play through where u start in the end and then at 100 days go to the nether and then at 200 survive another 100 in the over world  Something like that
FINNALY A WORTHY OPPONENT OUR BATTLE WILL BE LEGENDARY    if you dont get it i stream with my friends and play Minecraft hardcore in every dimensions and i started streaming a 100 day in hardcore Minecraft but every 1 hour it changes to another update version i start on alpha to 1.17
kill the dragon and get out to the overworld
28:14 Dino endship?
Why is no one talking about the AMONGUS
Luke the notable : yes endstone I need more  Everyone else : uhg more endstone throws it away
also btw, you can tell what day it is just by hitting F3. It is one of the data pieces in the mess of numbers and letters.

My man spent 100 days in the end without using a crafting table
Hear me out, 100 days on the ocean. You could make an ocean world and look for monuments, ruins, and shipwrecks.  Luke the notable Pirate
28:14 am I the only one who sees a t-rex in that end city?

Pls make this a series
I thought your girlfriend came back
Mr Notable i really like your videos. And the starting music is really peaceful and soothing.  Regards
We can go to overworld if we can construct a nether portal from obsidian in end
I mean, technically you can kill the dragon starting with your fists. Just beat up some endermen, pearl your way to the tops of all the towers, suicide the crystals, punch the dragon in the face
5:55 "...but I'm nowhere near inv-" *TITLE CARD*

Mojang should do an end update
Video idea: 100 Days - [Terraria]
Why didn't you get the sense to make an anvil which could make the dimos useful.
I love how people add all these mods while Luke just plays normal Minecraft in the end
They do have a end update planned
Luke Debatable
11:02 mmmmmmmmmmmmm ur wrong
You sir, are a pioneer. Living in the end? You must be the first one that would attempt that!
Pains me he never made a shulker box  They are literally backpacks
Me getting triggered because he isnt        crafting a shulker box
This guy is just proving MatPat's theory about the Endermen being the first  beings of Minecraft... Respect
Luke please try hypixel skyblock and do 100 days on it please
Endermen are my favorite mob
100 drops corny complex pleeeeeeeeeeeeese!!!!🙀🙀

*”violence is the answer”*  -Luke theNotable
Why didn't he make shulkers????
Did he make shulker boxes? Cause it’s hella nice especially when you have an enderchest for storage
Make your floor in your house out of glass because enderman cant spawn on glass
Day 8 what was that
Why didn't he make a shulker box
*Him* : 100 DayS In THE ENDD *me* : "Well I think My Stone House Looks Pretty Fireeee"
Man... everybody here loves him
Me when he didn't make shulker boxes:
“Quoting me. In the comment section. On my own video”
AT THE BEGINNING ITS NOT 30MINS!!! ITS 30:01 MINS!!! (Ok so maybe that is a exaggeration but still. 1 second off)
The episode was cheated but I still liked it
Great video loved it!
why did this had to happen
So what i like to do is turn structures like a stronghold into houses
luke ranting about not getting ender chests when the option of using shulker boxes using all that shulker shells with the chest from the end city he definitely got
How'd he get the torch I'm confused
*A M O N G U S*
U should play ark survival evolved is pretty fun u should do 100 days in to for how fun it is.

How do you know the days without days and nights in end
Me at the start: I know at the end hes ganna get full diamond
when diamonds are actually useless:
I thought I would make this hole to kill enderman and remembered that I have a whole enderman do farm
if this comment gets pinned it shows luke really likes and cares about his community
This is why we need the end update
Normally I would say like 206th comment but I have no idea how many comments there are whatever’th comment
YES ANOTHER
Everyone gangsta till watching minecaft videos on the internet.

Luke if it has a door it’s home The end: no Luke: but…  *NOOOO*
Wait... Am I the only one who don't understand why he don't make shulker box when he have storage problem?!
Let's be friends guys
Wow wow wow
Bruh next time he's gonna survive 100 days in the aether
How about 100 days of end hardcore? Sounded more interesting
No minecraft. I swear on water if I did have minecraft I would, but no minecraft. 21:14
You know you can make shulker boxes right, with the shulker shells and the chests. It'll definitely help with your inventory issues.
[|87
So no one's  talking about how he got those iron trapdoors
His past 4 videos have been 30:01 long
You don’t understand how painful it was for me to watch this while he complained about inventory space with 183 shucker shells he owns
ㄷㄷ
Living with no crafting table
You’ve really inspired me to keep going with my gaming channel.,
Nice upgrade you did to the house. They don't look like a ugly square anymore. They look notable

At the time of this comment, how is this number one on trending?
A m o n g   u s
luke install the optifine mod it's a visual mod then turn on the internal shaders they keep the same look and feel of the game while making it look much better also turn on connected textures this makes the glass look much better and much more but those are the most important 2
Its hurting every fiber in my soul that he isn’t making shulker boxes
He should do 100 days in a cave
You have been putting the 3000 days off for a pretty long time maybe you should start trying to do it
This video is very boring      And I love it

Pls comment luke

How are you that funny
I guess everyone gave up telling luke to get a skin lmao
11:55  *a m o g u s*
The sparkling april analogously admit because cereal bilaterally perform around a stingy badger. new, fanatical downtown
fun fact: combining 2 tools, armor, weapons or elytras gives them extra durability, i’m not sure how it’s calculated, but it’s more than if you use them separately  but enchantments gets cleared
Tried this super hard
The first notes when he puts the ender eyes in sounds like the start of the N64 main theme @ 0:29
Yep i see it now theyer quoting me there quoting me in the comments-ltn 2021
11:51 Pretty sus bro

'Quote me. In the commentsection. On my own video' -Luke TheNotable, 2021
You need to be 13 to watch his videos but i am 12 😢😢😢😢

why didnt he just create shulker boxes so he can take ALL the loot...?
Next: 100 days in adventure mode
Next: 100 days in a cave only world
Next: 100 days in skyblock
100 days in the ___ but i get one random item in the start.  You can only get one random item, then you do whatever you can in 100 days, like pick stuff up and farming stuff. The random item could be valuable for like the end like dirt or something, or something bad like a potion of water breathing in the end
26:45  ender dragon fountain ofc
Why didn't you make shulker boxes with chests from endcities and shulker shells?
Try to survive 100 hardcore in the Aether dimension
You should make an anvil so you could give the elytras unbreaking or something Like so LTN can see!
lol
I love watching these videossssss
*a mong u s*
Where's 200 days with tors?😣
200 days pls
Number 1 on trending this guys videos are so hyped and awesome
There is something that you had forgot in minecraft in the end is that shulker shell is useful when you craft chest in the middle and shulker shell between chest and you got shulker box, with that you can put even items in it, that is easy but you missed it.
When will 3000 days of minecraft be done
This is sad
AMOGUS

Luke in 200 day use 45 45 trick for using elytra if you dont know about it search it on yt

Hi
OK I dislike that as soon as I thought he's stalling for the fight YOU SAY I bet u think I'm stall and yes I am
You could theoretically beat the dragon with nothing, but it would be insanely difficult. Here's how:  1. Kill a crapton of endermen to get a lot of pearls  2. Use those pearls to teleport to the top of the pillars  3. Break each end crystal  4. Slowly and painfully kill the dragon with your fist  5. Profit

Yeah surviving 100 days in the end is difficult but you boi Ltn did it
Never noticed the hiss
There's a lot of comments asking how Luke got the iron trapdoors so I thought id explain. In end city chests, there is a 38.4% chance that it will contain 4-8 iron ingots. This means he could have gone into his inventory and crafted them using the 2x2 crafting grid. Hope this clears things up for anyone who is confused!
When the end update comes, you should go for 200, or more days.
hi luke im new and i love your videos and i hit the bell and the subscribe and liked can i shout out plz...
Heaven does exist.
Pretty notable that he went from 2 on trending for gaming to 1 on all of trending

Please say I am not the only one who forgot he had a kid
I love watching your videos Man
*It's the end of the world and people buy toilet paper. I guess they plan to shit themselves death.*
Luke please to 200 days in the end and add mods please bc there's one where you can go to the over world with a portal
i was in the middle of watching this and was like "why not"
Stuff like this is why, way back in the day I was of the opinion that every dimension should have a proper ecosystem for the player to interact with, as if there's enough gameplay to make surviving 100 days in the dimension alone _interesting_ then it also makes sojourns for the unique selling point of the dimension more interesting as well.
Day 32: it wouldn’t hurt to get full diamond” His inv: idk. That sounded sus
Luke should do the pandoras box mod, where earth becomes uninhabitable
luv that floor design
What about three thousand days did you die 😁😁
wait why didnt you just take an end gateway to the dragon
the next time with mods
the iron helmet is way better
All my homies hate baby villagers
why he no make shulker boxes he has chests and shulker shells -_- (no offence tho)
how'd he put the elytra on with the curse of binding chestplate
Bruh he could've made a shulker box with the shulkers and the chests in each end city 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
how did he know the time?????

Luke is doing a nether and end 100 days just to not play 1.17!1!1!!!1
I think luke died in the 3000 days world, so he is doing other vids to take your mind off 3000 days.
Dudes hes currently on #1 on actual trending
He got the torch by bedrock place
This is the best 100 days  video
Lmao stealing cxlvins ideas

You could beat start from the ender dragon by killing ender men for pearls then pearl up to crystals and then break them and then you have to kill the ender dragon while it’s pearching
please 3000 days
*WAIT PLEASE READ* I found something cool today. Everytime you click on a time stamp someone puts in the comments it gets darker every click. It turns black when you click it like 20 times. I don’t know why but I thought it was a cool Easter egg. Not cap. It enlightens back to normal after a few seconds. Try it for yourself!  0:01
That's is a gross floor
I almost thought that this video is the end of the 100 days series
The only only to reach level 4 without mining or using tools

im like 90% sure you can craft shulker boxes in your inventory without a crafting table
Do 100 days underground! I think that would be very interesting.
well i didnt know you could just bridge your way back to the end from the end islands, i thought it was basically a whole new island lmfao
Who achually tried this challenge? Raise their hand *raises hand*
I had this idea I was just to lazy to do it
make shulker chests with chest and shulkers shells
complete the 3000 days at minecraft hardcore survival
Amazing videos as always, but can we please get 3000 days (there’s gonna be about 20 mil views in it for u)
Lukes hundred days are always number one on trending
It's amazing how many people are willing to watch a dude mine endstone for half an hour.... And it's more amazing how I'm proud to be a part of the notable community. CONGRATS ON TRENDING LUKE!!

"You guys are pretty unoriginal and just quote me. I see it. Yep they're doing it right now. Quoting me." - Luke TheNotable 2021
GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH
This man has got you so much everyone is proud of him
Cool
You probably can’t do it if you’re on bedrock
Luke: And for the next 30 minutes you’ll watch me… Me: 30:01 Also me: Why are you lying?
Do 100 days underwater, you cannot go above water level but you can build bases in the water.
"some horse armor for the horse I don't own..." You don't own horse, horse owns you.
AMONG US
He has a dauter
Just do 3000 days plez
He’s number one on trending what a goat
What if I’m not notable
JESUS said in JOHN 3:3 ye MUST BE BORN AGAIN to enter the KINGDOM of GOD, it's a spiritual rebirth and transformation upon accepting and believing the LORD JESUS CHRIST. if one dies not being BORN AGAIN, they will end up in the place that was prepared for the devil and his angels (MATTHEW 25:41) in the place of outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (HELL/SHEOL/HADES) but we don't have to go there, THE bible says in ROMANS 10:9 "CONFESS WITH YOUR MOUTH THAT JESUS CHRIST IS LORD, AND BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD, AND YOU SHALL BE SAVED."  PEOPLE PERISH WHEN THEY REJECT THE FREE GIFT OF GOD, THE WAS OFFERED THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. TO REJECT JESUS IS TO REJECT SALVATION. JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN, NO OTHER WAY, NO OTHER PATH. THERE IS ONLY ONE NAME GIVEN TO US WHERBY WE MUST BE SAVED (ACTS 4:12)
He survived without a crafting table.  He's a legend.
why do you not have acustom skin?
I love these - me :)

You could do 100 days in adventure mode

Number 1 on trending!!!!
This is 1st on trending
* God's grace *  Did you know that God loves you so much that he sent Jesus to save us? Jesus is the son of God! And he loves you very much! To have proof of this, we can say that he emptied himself of all his glory and stepped on the earth! Isn't that wonderful? And there's more! He assured us of salvation! He fulfilled the mission that God gave him! Which is to have a death on the cross for all people in the world! * How do I get to heaven? * It's very simple! -Accept Jesus as your Lord and only Savior! - Repent of your sins daily even those you don't know because you sinned out of ignorance! -Recognize that you do not deserve God's salvation but even with your faults He wanted to save you with his great love and grace! Now about keeping your faith -Read the Bible daily -Pray and fast -Go to a church that follows the word of God  May God bless you greatly! 👋
That’s crazy thanks I actually made some money from it
Wait wouldn’t you get teleported to the overworld when you enter the end portal
You should survive 100 irl days
Anyone else hear a girl scream at 17:50
so is nobody going to talk about how he got a torch in the end?
When should we tell him curse of vanishing doesn’t matter in Hardcore
Please try this game called sneaky Sasquatch
Right sir
Skyblock 100 days?
Bullys in the end be like: Go to Bed!!
what about the boxes
Luke: the type of guy to casually walk away during an ender dragon fight
I hope he makes a video about the new Halo Infinite trailers
Could’ve made a shocker box to Store his items And take it with him
I recommend Luke watch Loony Adventure. In my own opinion, a better hardcore survival series. Luke's are good, but that is my opinion.
i dont like your house
I like what you did with the house looks good for only being in the end also seeing how this went makes me want to try it on Minecraft bedrock PlayStation edition of this
Why didn’t you use shucker boxes?
#1 on trending
To make dmg to the end dragon you have to hit his head while being Just under it
12:02 THAT GAVE ME A HEAART ATTACK
Should've downloaded the Better End mod.
When’s 3000 days
Have you considered doing a 500 days starting from one part of the game and moving to the next after 100 days? Start in the nether, move underground overworld, end, etc.  Keeping your inventory and what's in your end chest when you swap to make a new base.
Finally biys
Could you make a new 100 day series? In the overworld, maybe probably not?
someone make this man a skin
"quote me"
Play fortnite again
OH MY GOD JUST DO 3000 DAYS ALREADY
"Thats what they're doing quoting me... Right now"

I actual did the challenge a while a go  it was fun and  hard until O got elytra
Ey its the same guy that tried to trademark 100 days
Luke: Welcome to the end. Me: So the video is a few seconds long.
Fun fact: If you ever find a portal to the main end island theres almost always a city near it
How did he get iron trapdoors
Hi
how did he get a torch though
Im only liking because the video is exactly 30 min long
Face reveal?
The reason you couldnt hit the dragon is because the dragon has a wacky tobaccy hitbox.
this guy needs a LOT more credit for starting the 100 days thing. ltn, your a madlad
I’m still wondering where you got that torch from
“I’m ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ

Do 100 days with the Create mod! That would be really cool!
Please do 100 days in skyblock
Whenever you release a video it always hits number 1 on trending

Luke, I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again. Stop postponing 3000 days.
The video is exactly 30:00
Maybe caves 100 days for the new update
The wall before day 81 : call the ambulance call the ambulance  After day 81: but not for me

Luke i can watch your videos all day such good content.I know you have come a long way keep up the good work and as always stay NOTABLE!
You should do modded minecraft for 100 days.
His life ended.
SPOILER        Lukes battle with the ender dragon is like the tunnel wars during ww1
If you can survive in a barren wasteland, you should try to survive in a super flat world in bedrock edition
luke not realising he can make a shulker box with 2 shulker shells and a chest
Do a 200 days an then you can do a 300
If you're wondering how he got a torch, the bedrock exit portal on the main end island has 4 torches on it

In short :  - Take corus fruits  - Kill endermen  - Find end cities  - Get stuff - Repeat that again until you have sufficient stuff - Construct useless buildings to wait for day 100 - Fight the Enderdragon
It’s so funny cuz the house he has is a house that everyone wants to make in the over world like that’s a normal house for him
I tried to  un-watch this video. Ended up watching it a second time. I’ll never get that time back.  I think I’ll try again.

We've sent close to a 1000 Rockets/with Elon saying he's sending another 1000.    They are *weapons* designed to stop "Wormwood" in the book of Revelation in the Bible.    All Telescopes on this planet are pointing in the same direction.    Elon is building underground tunnels in major cities.    "Wormwood" is going to hit the PACIFIC OCEAN. *EVACUATE*.    All the ELITE TOP COMPANIES ARE EVACUATING THE PACIFIC COASTS...SO SHOULD YOU!!!  2. "The mark of the beast".       Take 3 6's and place them in a circle and you have a virus warning symbol.     But the Mark is the VACCINE. And because it is a global problem it will demand a global solution.     *The Vaccine will be given Airborne and it will land on your forehead and hands.*     It will try to alter Chromosome 7 lamb1.     It is during these moments where the Bible mentions: *You will wish the mountains to fall on you.*     And this is also the moment where the Bible mentions: The "few" and the "many".     "Few" will die from this Vaccine (millions) and "many" will live (billions).     This vaccine will cure all diseases BUT it will not remove the Pain from any injuries you receive.     That is the moment of the "delusion" mentioned in Revelations.      If you get a cut or any injury, the pain will never go away, they just keep building up.     You will wish the "mountains to fall on you".     666 (six - sick - sicknesses) <->  *Six species of human corona viruses are known* ,      with some species subdivided into two different strains,          making seven strains of human corona viruses altogether.      Rev. 13:16 is referring to those who DIDN'T make the rapture of the church (The not "born again" PEOPLE).    1st Horseman is the Bow (SEND it). < That Horse rides as we speak. All the Rockets this Planet SENDS into Space are Weapons of mass Destruction targeted at "Wormwood". For almost 2 years now our Planet as sent almost 1000 Rockets into space and now we are averaging 3.23 a day. Elon just boasted within the past month how he intends to send a 1000 more.   BEFORE those ROCKETS touch "WORMWOOD", 2 EVENTS will happen. 1 Event will be the "RAPTURE" and 1 will be the "AIRBORNE VACCINE". < BOTH OF THESE EVENTS HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME.  < The "AIRBORNE VACCINE" is the reason it happens.  I have to stop here and explain something. Our Souls are physically attached to Our flesh by Chromosome 7 lamb1. When a Person (truly) becomes "BORN AGAIN" Chromosome 7 lamb1 CHANGES. So now you have 2 different groups of People on the Planet. Those who are "born again" w/the altered "lamb1" and those who don't.  Now having said that. When the "AIRBORNE VACCINE" lands on your forehead and hands, it's going to try and alter Chromosome 7 lamb1 AGAIN. When it does, ONLY those who are "BORN AGAIN" will die. Those who don't have the altered "lamb1" will LIVE...and be able to buy and sell during the TIME OF THE ANTICHRIST. The "BORN AGAIN" People are people who have God's Holy Spirit INSIDE THEIR SOULS.  *God's Holy Spirit* isn't on this planet during the 7 years of the antichrist. His Spirit is raptured from this planet BEFORE THE 2ND HORSEMEN RIDES!!!!! (I'm throwing pearls, you better be getting this). <<<<and all of that can't happen till the "LAST SUPPER" (see my "Last Supper" video on my channel) is over.  Then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Horsemen happen.  So once again. The "mark of the beast" is NOT A CHIP.  ITS THE COMING "AIRBORNE VACCINE". You must be "born again" before the "airborne" vaccine is given or you will be here for the 7 years of the antichrist.   3. The scorpions mentioned in Revelation 9:10.      There are satellites in space called HIVES.    Inside each of them are tiny rockets called BEES.    They are designed to Target all CELL PHONES.    CELL PHONES ARE HOMING DEVICES.    Buy cell phone Jammers now and be ready to save those around you when it happens.     Throw your phone and run if you feel in danger. Don't stand in the same spot.    Be prepared. Buy short wave walkies-talkies. They can have up to 5 mile capabilities.     They will be mercy killings by our governments because of the actions above with their missiles (for 5 Months after the asteroid hits).    They were just tested against that RV that blew up Tennessee. The reason the word "scorpions" was used?  What the person saw was a vision and then it ended up in Revelation. The "vision" He saw was long cylinder puffy clouds streaming from the skies, lots of them and at the end of each of those was a tiny little missile, but to the person having the vision, to him it looked like a bunch of scorpion tails or should I say cloud TRAILS.  Please I'm begging you to listen to what I've said. These events are happening right now. There's a *GRAVITATIONAL PULL HAPPENING.* ( *Wormwood (rock heading this way in space) of the book of Revelation* in the Bible ) Floods in the desserts of Saudi Arabia. Blizzards in Spain. Huge clouds, heavy rains and flash floods in Saudi deserts, Qunfudhah, Taif Mass fires in Brazil. Hot Spot - Ocean, & Scanning Yellowstone Super Volcano. 1/21/2021 Mass electrical storms in Turkey. Hot Spots & Scanning Yellowstone Super Volcano.. 1/17/2021 Neva River freezes, Saint Petersburg, Russia Volcanoes are activating around the Globe. Sewage fountains out of drains during floods in Cochabamba, Bolivia And more...! Luke 21:11  There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.  I don't post links no more because YouTube removes them. This is so important that you help  me tell others. I didn't make anything up. If you get a moment come see what else I've discovered on my channel. But I beg you with all of my heart and soul to at least tell someone what you've read. Please at least do that. Nothing on my channel is monetized.  Folks, we are SENDing rockets into space to STRIKE a rock that the book of Revelation in the Bible calls "wormwood" and when those rockets SPLIT a piece will hit right above INDONESIA in the Pacific Waters and it will rock up and down the FIRE RING of the PACIFIC sending LAVA TO THE SKIES which will *SEAR* 2/3rds of this PLANET.  *I'M BEGGING YOU, HELP ME WARN OTHERS!*   You're thinking how can you believe me? I'm the guy who God showed where His Garden of Eden was ( *I can backup those words* if you come to my channel). *SOON A GLOBAL king WILL APPEAR, DON'T FOLLOW him he IS THE ANTICHRIST!*  NOTE: *SOON SOCIAL MEDIA WILL DISAPPEAR GO TO MY CHANNEL AND COPY MY COMMENTS AND VIDEOS SO YOU CAN SHARE WITH OTHERS ON DISKS. NOT ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE HEAVEN (THE RAPTURE), YOU'LL BE THE REVOLUTIONIST FOR JESUS DURING THE 7 YEARS OF THE ANTICHRIST. BE READY TO HELP OTHERS. DURING THE 7 YEARS, THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE HEAVEN IS TO BE A MARTYR FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS. YOU DON'T DO IT BECAUSE OF THE PAIN YOU FEEL. YOU DON'T DO IT BECAUSE YOUR SCARED. YOU ONLY DO IT BECAUSE YOU REALIZE WHAT A MISTAKE YOU MADE AND NOW YOUR WILLING TO GIVE YOUR LIFE FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS. BE BOLD IN THOSE DAYS, OTHERS WILL BE WATCHING YOU AND WHAT YOU DO WILL INFLUENCE THEM. MAKE WISE CHOICES MY FRIEND. THERE IS A CELEBRATION IN HEAVEN EACH TIME SOMEONE COMES TO THE SAVING KNOWLEDGE OF JESUS. DON'T LET EVIL STEAL YOURS AWAY FROM YOU. STAND STRONG AND WHEN I SEE YOU I'LL GIVE YOU A BIG HUG AND A KISS ON THE NECK AND WE'LL CELEBRATE FOR ALL ETERNITY!*

Best video ever !nice job
Next do 100 days - minecraft  bedrock
tip: if you ever do this again, convert the endstone to endstone bricks, and then convert the endstone bricks into slabs. It's way lest costly to do this, since you're turning 4 building blocks into 6.

100 days in the twilight forest? it recently got a new update. and i would love to see it
This was mind boggling to watch, every second drained at my will to live until the final dragon kill where I just sat in my gaming chair thanking every god imaginable that it was over. 10/10, I never want to see the end again.
next he should do a 1.17 caves only world
How many days does this take to film?

100 days on the overworld
"unmodded" but you used creative to build an end portal then teleported away from main island. which clearly proves this is impossible in survival. unless you brought blocks from overworld...come to think of it...why didn't you just do that. then you wouldnt need creative or teleporting 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
100 days, uncut would be a catastrophe.
lol
Shouldn't he make a shulker box? His life would be much easier.
“quote” -Luke TheNotable, July 3, 2021

"quoting me in my own comment section"
when wood is rarer than elytras:
I feel he should continue this series by going into the over world, but he can only make a tiny place in it to make a nether portal. Therefore the only two places he can go are into the nether and end.
Do 200 days with tors
I thought the city’s fruit farm was gonna be a bowling alley
Late to commenting so Luke prob wont see this. But 2 things. Do some modded 100 days. And you are neither insane or notable. You are notably insane! Ok time to reminisce on the times where I didn't make paragraph long comments.

200 days with the tors Please it’s been a whole year now Like this so LTN  CAN SEE IT
[This article uses Google Translate] Although not related to this video, but I want to tell the truth. I'm Korean, and I'm a Minecraft fan, but the current Korean government is treating Minecraft as an "Adult Game" after July 2nd, 2021 for nonsensical reasons. A government agency called the “Ministry of Gender Equality and Family” discriminates against men, oppresses the lives of ordinary people, and pollutes Korea, a fact that many people do not know, but Korea is a rather disgusting country than you think, the Korean government is rotten and , diverting the country's money, promoting gender conflict, laziness in supporting the country's technological prowess, and pretending that Korea is a wonderful country under the pretext of Korea's economic power in the 2000s. But the Korean people are suffering. I hope many people know the truth about Korea. I want Korean teenagers to enjoy Minecraft.

30:01 seconds... Ouch
watching him not take those ender chest on earlier day was just sanity.

You should do 100 days in the overworld again once they change it for Caves and Cliffs!

This man tries to survive everywhere to learn absolutely every aspect of the game to become the ultimate hardcore minecraft player. Quite Notable. Also how about a chalenge you, Luke, Will find impossible to do: You need to survive 100 days anywhere, with any help, BUT you should make complex Redstone contraptions or the progress won't count. I know it's quite Hard and it Will probably give you a lot more problems to face and You’ll hate redstone a lot more, but i am not insisting. Also, can you even die in your 2000 days world? Like, is there anything that can kill you before you kill it?
Is enyone gone tell him that you can make a shulkerbox whitout a craftingtabel
Did you have iron could’ve made a iron door And and I had pressure plate

It was over. They heard all my phone calls... Now I can't go back inn music. It was just too prove god wrong.. That's all. Cable's are running under are house. They turn them up. So I can't go spiritual. And too kill me... There all using nextdoor....  We Are all inn a triangle.... I can't be bothered too go deep... Okay they don't want god.... Not because of heaven.. They don't want the world too end... Okay the triangle they made.. This was civilisation... Control.. Seeing a world.. Remember nothing is real... Ppl at the top of the triangle have all the power. They don't need god..... Black magic . Drinking children's blood.. Sports stars get more powerful .. You can become anything you want too be. They hold the power.. Children are the next generation. So there left and see if They can go too the top of the triangle. LA is the devils pit...They don't know god has already taken pure humans with 3 emotions too heaven... Okay the vaccine there giving you. Is changing your DNA... So your not pure human... Why do this.. It's too end ppl inn the bottom of the triangle.. Ppl at the bottom. Hold the key too religion.. Because of poor and poverty... So we pray too god for a better life or family... If your DNA has changed. You lose a link too god.... They need too get riding poverty. Ppl that are depressed... Ppl that live for god... It's all faith... This keeps God's connection too you... Are universe is a tringel.. Think off a 4 wall mirror... You still have the North star. Your connection... Alien life is everywhere... Remember we all light... You can be any image... And God's imagination makes anything looks human.... If we all get a vaccine are DNA is changed... They can kill if everyone inn the lower bottom of the triangle... Celebrity controls you.. ENVY...There told what too do.. Nobody stands up too govements no more.. Because there just kill it clone you... Children's bloodied drunk. Too make you younger... But you have too do it inn a way there inn so much fear drenalin.... When the bottom of the ppl inn the triangle have gone.. There is no reason for FAITH.... The scientist beat religion Because your have more power.. And money.. So a deep depression and poor of poverty has gone.. A new world order.. Where ppl don't need too pray.. The world can go on.... It's not just your DNA....they can cause disease.... And it's easier too kill ppl.... Tap water medications. Ppl at the top will not have this vacvine... most Jewish ppl as well... There trying too kill me.. Ever since God can too me. I was the 17th.. I had my soul stolen when I was a song writer she did work for the fbi. There pouring evil all inn my mind. And mind control..They done everything too kill me... I kept getting out of hospital.... I have a clone Of me... Someone is trying so hard too keep me alive... She saw god. Inn my connection.. She saw everything she saw the real me.... She wants me alive because she didn't know why they wanted her too hurt me.... think.. Who has the power too delete me of Spotify iTunes amazon..... Goggle .... Goggle is the illuminate.... They have you inn control.... The only way you can keep god is if you all come off social media.... You can go free... They have no tool.. For control.. You won't judge or hate.... It true my connection went all round the earth... A team of.ppl.came too are house and out me as mental health.... They just turned up.... After I write songs.... They did this so I look like a loose cannon..... I made a deal... If I go back too god.. I would choose her... It's all about it I change the background too a sky blue... you have too go spirtal... You have too give god you spirt everything.... You have too connect with Venus... It's your only way too connect with angels.... Because it's too dangerous for angels too come down.. The devil is everywhere... If we lose technology we can become free... With are one emotions.... If she breaks my connection she knows there kill me... She's hoping I go back spirtal.. And go back.... She knows are settle with her.... I keep my word.... Prince William. Will be king. I can't say more about him.. you don't have too believe this.. It's all about choice... Ppl inn the bottom of the triangle. You hold the power so much.. If you don't judge you can't hate.. God needs this. Because we love and be inn peace. God wanted a free world.. 3 pure humans. With 3 emotions. Too rule the world.. No war. No greed. No programs too mind control you. Playing with your emotions.. The top half of the world is inn greed. And there separating themselves from the bottom half... It's all devil worship.. America and Britain.. Celebs stay young .. Blood. There giving keys. Too tunnels. You can change your light. So your image can change.. God can't tell you. It's up too ppl he goes too.... This spiritual war has gone on so long.... You can only be happy if you don't judge. You can't hate. And red and black will go from your soul.... They have your minds but not your heart.. Listen too your heart and see if god is happy with all this... You should get an answer... If you end social media no more control. Your go free.. Life is about yourself..

You should do 100 days on one block sky block
Can Fly. Can't make an crafting table. Luke The Notable: Stonks

I tried 100 days n nether but I died at day 57 :/
*_It's time to end it all!_*
you could make a 100 days challenge with the world type: caves, or floating islands
I think you can make a nether portal in the end
*among us*
Endermans were players but in the overworld they were atackt constantly so they moved to the end they were living in peace with the dragon but the corus fruit made them endermans they ate to much of it so that's y there are seeds and stuff
alternative title: 100 days of a nan slowly going insane
You know you can make shulker boxes right? You have chests, and you have shulker shells.
Before this video i thought that there was only 1 one end city

E-n-d-e-r       C-h-e-e-s-e
You are so funny
I recommend using a resource pack if you do this, if you don’t like being in creative.
Your house is very COOL Mr Notable
How he got the torch is still mystery
Why you not use shulker chests
Man, do a 100 days in SKYBLOCK
Where is 3000 days

End busting but with extra steps
Gamer Girl Coffee Breath. LUL. I could probably claim a longer Ender Dragon fight, because I'm garbage at combat and I most recently fought her in Bedrock. I had to return multiple times. But I didn't record it all, so you got me there.
How about a modded Minecraft ??

this man straight said heaven dont exist without even flinching.
As far as I know, the elytra only degrades when you have it equipped and you are stationary, that is, it does not break when you are flying
.
In the world of shulker boxes he have inventory problems .... Idiot
Stop wasting your time on there and focus more on making 300 days lol
Luke you should do 100 day challenges in different mods like rl craft and in winter like forge labs it would be very entertaining
Wait but where did he get the torch? 😳
No one is in this world who not liked his minecraft house design
you kinda dumb all of those ones that are three high has loot in it and your only looting the top one
What a Notable video, GG
26:42 I SAWW  😂😂..... where did u got iron trapdoor?
29:53 Luke : "I really hope you enjoyed watching and if you didn't, well it's not like you can unwatch this video" *[Remove From Watch History]* :  "Very poor choice of words"
THE BEGINNING OF THE END
Luke: Well, it’s not like you can unwatch this video Me: *laughs in short term memory loss*
Stay notable
Couldn’t Luke have just made shulker boxes from the chests he found in the end cities, and then the shells from the shulkers to free up space in his inventory?
I call ends tonight end cheese
He is so sad sometimes lol
Let's go

This reminded me of Mitchell’s vs the machines black void of distant space thing
Do 100 days in the hardcore over world!
day 1 the end
Can you survive 100 days undergroend
I'm glad that he's joking about the trademarks thing now. People were so mad at the time but I really feel like he's content with letting the 100 days stuff be for everyone. Good shit, Mr. Notable.

"quote me in the comments section on my own video"    I am probably the millionth person who did this
hey anyone remember when this dude went incredibly money hungry and tried to trademark a fortnite/Minecraft video style he created even though every single person that used it credited him? I do.
Awhowants him to do a four thousand day thing in his real world not 3000 when it ends its so sad
I enjoyed this I really did
Luke was cool until he said heaven wasn't real🤦🏽‍♂️
Where did he get the torch? I’m confused
Mojang: releases 1.17 Luke: surviving 100days in the end

I accidentally lived in the nether if you are looking for challenge imitation. Glitch tossed me thousands of blocks away from my portal so i had to live in the nether and bargin with piglins to get home
He did it. The madman actually did it. But WHAT COULD BE NEXT
Best end house in minecraft
29:15 I think you can only do damage to the dragon's head when it's down.
How about 100 days in hardcore minecraft in 3rd person view? I've always wanted someone to play in 3rd person for longer period of time
worst position of death by ender dragon
Тот самый русский комментарий
This is cool but, If you were to do the end project again I would recommend you're allowed a couple items like a dirt block.
Luke if you play this again I'll give you two cookies
How many failed products do YOU have?….    I have 2
Fun fact there's a faster way to get to the top of the pillar where the shulkers are throw an ender pearl in the middle that should hit the top part and be ready to move cause when it hits the top quickly run into the other side and boom your done
Since Luke thinks the comments are getting a little boring because everyone is quoting him, here’s a normal comment. This video slapped Luke, art. The amount of effort that went in the making of this video is unbelievably crazy. Truly a chad.
People-WE WANT HARDCORE MINECRAFT LTN!3000 da..... LTN-Okay (Hrdcore minecraft in the end)
I want to see this with a crafting table
Among us
Did you die during 3000?

Haha
Cruelty/ cruel
Cool vid
Why didn't he make Shulker box's
Hi guys
Use a anvil to combine the loot you get.
Can you make a nether portal in the end?
Seeming's he's in the end I'm very surprised someone can even get this far (also your house look nice)
Anyone else just realize that it is Luke TheNotable not The Notable
Heaven exists in real life

Number 4 trending
Nice video
Diamonds a my favorite I can unsubscribe
You should've pressed F3 and it shows you the days on the left row on the screen
Luke it isn't going to be 10 years till an end update only 2
Hey LTN, you should try 100 days underwater! I think it could be a fun idea, idk if its original tho
Your momument looks like umm…. A german leader

muito show ^^

Funny I get recommended this after me and my friends beat the dragon 4 times within 1 hr
everyone gangsta till nobody noticed there's a chest in The End but no wood
I tried this it sucks
Minecraft needs to get an uncrafting table so things could be turned into the base items I know it would help in this situation but this made me think about it
calvin did it first
11:30 there is a cross 😱
he get torch from the ender dragon island in the middle

I tried this and died
Yeah i don’t like it
Hi
amogus.
Why didn't you used sulker box!!!
4MILLION ON THE WAY
28:13 end city kinda looks like a dragon standing on two legs and rawring or a duck holding a staff.
“I had no inventory space” Me:Shulker Box

"Im not insane im notable" - Luke 2021

Do 100 days on top of the nether roof.
Me: sees title Also me: cool with better end right? Luke: … Me: with better end right?   *madlad*
Plz do 3000 DAYS IN HARDCORE
19:13 he has torches in his inventory, how is that possible if he's in the end? I don't think you can get coal or sticks from chests in end ships/city's and since he's not using a mod there shoudn't be any trees or ores.....  Also at 25:56 he used iron trapdoors you need a crafting table to make those, again im pretty sure you can't get those from end ships or end city's and there's no wood in the end.  Someone please explain this to me
do a desert only or badlands only or a mushroom biome only 100 days video please. loved this one
Next video: 100 days on the Nether roof(Above bedrock in the Nether)
3:21 He dies!!!
Now I know he cheats on his hardcore worlds
He's gotten to the point of torturing himself to avoid doing 3000 days.
I love what happened in the end.
100 days in skyblock please

14:36 the island looks like Antarctica
11:53 “My inventory’s looking pretty sus, 📮 A M O N G U S”

You should do 100 days hardcore with a steering wheel

Is it just me it does anyone else think LTN is never going to make 3,000 days in hardcore Minecraft?
I miss the over world 😢
I'm wondering why you didn't create a shulkerbox
btw at 26:44 the way he got the torch was the exit portal on the main end island
You could have make shulkur boxes
200 days with the tor’s???!!!
Yes!!
you hit the ender dragon wrong hit it in the neck
Flip, im so stupid, i was wandering why didnt he craft shulker boxes.... He has no crafting table.
How did I know inside the monument he was making a chorus fruit farm because I quote myself “ Farm is love, Farm is life.”
it is a little bit boring
Luke just made 100 days in the end interesting. How?
Im still waiting for 100 days without wood...
This might one of the most expensive 100 days I've ever seen
absolutely love your commentary, always a good time, ty for the upload!
If luke did a 1000 days surviving in the end We can check if mattpat's theory that you become endermen after Eating too much corus Fruit is true or not lol
Why does he not make an shulker box
Wait how did he get the iron trapdoor
When you look at the time on your phone for the day thats when you know you’ve watched all the hundred day
Yeah cool but where's 3000 days hardcore?😩
I was mentally yelling at him for not making an anvil go improve his loot.  See he cant make a crafing table-
100 days bedrock edition?
woooooow
LAMO

Him killing the endermen **reads dictionary for attacking words**
You should collaborate with other mc 100 days youtubers but hardcore
Curse of vanishing: *appears in chest* Luke whos in hardcore:i have no such Weakness
I suggest doing another type of mod. Maybe all drops are random for 100 days or Rlcraft. Something like that would be very popular
"the customers ALWAYS right"  Well then Luke, we're the customers and we say you continue and besides you'll get money, from YouTube
100 days of skyblock lol
Good at Minecraft Notable at thumbnails
I saw the item frames which are unattainable, WWWHHHYYY
Floor sucks
Its god
Series idea: 100 days with 1 heart, 200 days with 2 hearts, 300 days with 3 hearts, and so on so forth until you reach full health
This video goes to show how much the end needs a biome update
How about 100 day in Minecraft Bedrock edition. (It can be on phone, console or pc)
Violence isn't the answer violence is a question and the answer is yes
MAKE A SHULKER BOX MAN
Yes
This seems pretty cool, would start my own youtube channel on these challenges, but nobody would see it until 2024.
He may be in “The End” but this isn’t the end.
Shulker boxs ?
Who wants luke the notable do a 100 days on sky block hardcore
Actually if I remove the video from my recent watch I could actually remove the views

Luke 2025: 100 Day - [Minecraft Void]
19:02
Before I watch I’m guessing he gets pickaxe from end cities and eats chorus fruit
Luke will always be notable
Why did you just not craft a shulkers...?
I literally did this like a month ago
Yes I can unwatch this video! Library/history/.../remove for watch history.
But really, where did he get the torch????
This guys pretty notable ngl
“What would you do if a child was right in front of you?” Luke: **pulls out diamond sword**
Yes
Hey Luke hope it proud of me I survived 100 days on bedrock self imposed hardcore
9:32 thorns three isn't even a real thing lol
I wonder if there's gonna be "Can you survive 100 days underground" where at least a mod will kill him if the player encounters daylight or moonlight. Wood can be accessed from mines but he just has to live in a hole and get materials with what he finds
Peanis
Where did he get the torch tho
!!!!
You know its a good day when luke posts
100 days wood tools.
is he gonna make a 3k days in minecraft???????
26:02 enderman : let me in LET ME IN
Ahem, ibxtoycat did it before you
@LukeTheNotable if you record on xbox game bar, go to settings>capturing. game sounds and enabled mic only, it helps sooo much to get rid of background static and weird glitchy parts ;)
Hey luke you know what you should do 100 days in a cave from the new caves and cliffs update
Use slabs for your roof. So you won't scrape and no endermen Wait no crafting table
Wait you have a wife or single dad?
4 on trending for gaming :)
When you said my children will be endstone miners you can’t have children in the end will you have children with endermen
Wait how did u get the item frame? There’s no leather in the end
Maybe this is a metaphor to where Luke is heading (the end!!!)
LTN: "worthless items - diamonds" Me: Traitor! But then again I am quoting you so all sins forgiven
I saw this and thought how did I he survive it but now I understand
When this gets recommended in 8 years I’m glad to say I was at cliffs when this was premiering
Two words that could have helped      Shulker box

What's up with the intro you changed it?
For next time to always get a hit on the Ender dragon you can just hit it in the head which always does damage
Am I tripping or did he forget the door?
Howd he get that torch 😶
One of the ender man just say hello 😲😲
Please make 200 days neither please.
Does anyone know how he got the torch ?
ahhaha
In thos video he is so calm he is another ltn from a onether universe
Bro you can play better end mod
Did you die in your 2000 day hardcore world
11:55 *a m o n g u s*
Love you
Heh lol at 17:03
Sus🤨 11:56
Luke should have taken that ender chest it couldve saved him a ton of space and why did he keep the shulker shells I dont think the end has crafting tables
Alternate title: man beats Minecraft without touch a crafting table
As always stay notable
18:43 (NFT) NOTABLY FORGOTTEN TAPE 🤷🤦
oh end did you now if you pawer the dragon head wit red stone it will champ
You should do a amplified world next time! And then live in the mountains or something
I noticed that this is not hardcore
I I love his channel
o dam I can’t even imagine having no wood for 100 days 🤨 like if u agree
There was a end ship in the first end city

If you think about it rewinding a video is unwatchable it
Did he say the s word 😐
Alex eating some delicious chorus fruit
Ok, I have an idea. You should do 200 days in the end...BUT you get a crafting table (and maybe a few other things from the overworld or something)
Hahahahha yes
So when 1000 days in the end?
And your brain is a endstone minor lol
YESS!

100 days Minecraft Skyblock
Why not trending
And they said it couldn’t be done
Hello! Love your vids keep it up
how did he get ladders?
That must have been so stressful.
Most people:survives in the end using a mod that and stuff like end wood  Luke the notable:survives in the end without the mod and in hard core
I like how he just winged it how much time has passed to say its the next day, it takes a real man to do so
You could make a anvil out of all the iron you get and then you can keep the stuff you have and try to get maxed
This video was notable
When u said Heaven isn't real for a person with anxiety that's pretty SCARY
Congrats on 3.89M subscribers lol ;P lookin forward to 4M. Unfortunately, I can only subscribe once ;(  He do be notable tho ngl     lol imagine 100 days hardcore rlcraft, that'd be godly
“At least I’ll have a place my worthless stuff like diamonds”    Luke the notable 2021
are you going to make 3000 days because i am waiting
ok I actually kinda love ur house design
Hey, how did you get those ladders at the beginning of the video?
Love how he didn't make an iron door
He’s doing it again, I must subscribe

Whoever is reading this, I just want to remind everyone that Jesus loves you and has amazing plans for you.

“Day ur mom”   😔 why Luke I’m crying
Amung us
Hey who is ready for 3000 days
Day 1 of asking Luke to make 100 days on 1 block
I would kill to see him do a speedrun starting in the Nether.
I lost my mind in day 69 when I'm playing on the end
Do 200 days with the tors or 100 drops the airship
Part of me wants to see him destroy all of the end cities and create one massive end city. The best part is all the rooms will be useless and empty because he has very little stuff.
why didnt he make a shulker box? or am I slow.
now, luke owns the alex skin lmao
Didn’t you upload this already
can we just talk about how he respawned in hardcore
You gotta do something like 100 days under water somehow or 100 days underground.
Hey
100 DAYS TRAIN MOD
Can we just give a round of applause to this guy
I wonder if people are like, "I like how the comments are not funny or amusing at all ."
What happened to shulker boxes ltn
I had that idea once
Feather falling potion - Luke The Notable
Don't talk about the torch

He's so notable that everyone quotes him, try surviving 100 days in terraria hardcore!
why not do 100 days in wynncraft or hypixel skyblock
Now we gotta ask for the End Update
It hurts that he would get chests but not make shulker boxes.
AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE horribly disabled from all the inbreeding
OPOPOP
Wait how'd he get the torch fr
he could have put a trapdoor on the top or bottom then put down a pressure plate for basically a door?

“What the heck, I left the chests up here. These are valuable!” - Luke TheNotable, Day 77
Y’all I got so scared, I saw this in my notifs (because all the og’s have notifs on for luke) and I thought this meant the end of 100 days, like in general
Cult
You could have got shulker box as there chest in the end city
when you make 3000
Wait? Did he actually go into creative for the torch, like just to get the egg? This is a stupid question
As I’m watching this it says it’s #1 on trending for gaming! Keep up the amazing work man!
Well played
stop using the alax skin
He can't sleep-
I can’t believe it’s 30 mins and drum roll please  1 SECOND

Alex Chorus Fruit mukbang
Next hardcore series: I spent 100 days with only 1 inventory slot
I hope next update mojang is adding end biomes 😂
3000 days plz
3000 days hardcore bro
The torch is from the exit portal
He should do a “I spent 100 Days explaining why Windows 10 would be better then Java if they were to remove micro transactions but because of them is the worst version of Minecraft”
That so cool
Just wonder are you ever going to do another 100 drops
This may help u in end crystal does no damage if u are under the crystal
How did he get Torch?
Lifeless void dudududu lifeless void dududududu lifeless void
UwU
U could have taken one price of dirt and 1 sapling it would be a bit more fun
Truly notable
I think this is the first time that one mc youtuber said diamonds are useless
28:14 Look left it look like a dinosaur
hope you get 10M subs
You all know I'm gonna be watching this entire video
kool
😴
Wait I’m still confused on how he got the damn torches
"Do you see it, yup. They're doing it right now, quoting me, in the comment section. On my own video."    -LukeTheNotable 2021
The reason you were not doing damage to the dragon is that u can only damage it by hitting the neck
100 days vanilla slyblock?
isn’t mojang adding an end update after caves and cliffs?
Hello I’m Luke the footable
"if the world of love falls, pick it up and hold it higher"   -bigband
How do you know the time?
5:40 HE SAID MY NAAAAAAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
idea:  he should play with a curse of binding pumkin on his head for 100 minecraft days
Didn’t know if you realized that you had the resources to make an anvil… would have helped construct your armor. Great video!
how would we get the torches though?  the bedrock thiing in the middle has 4 torches after u kill the dragon but does it have 4 torches b4?
You should burn all the iron armor for iron even though it’ll take year to get a stack of iron
when would the 2000 days of minecraft end =)) P.s: 20:50 you don't even get a single damage
The fact that he could have easily made a shulker box. Is just bruh.
You should try 100 days skyblock
I know how to un watch the video  😀💥🔫 🪦🔻🌋🌋🔥🔥 Hell for even thinking to un watch such a notable video
This looks  torturous.....
Anyone that’s watched game theory knows that Luke will turn into an enderman with the amount of chorus fruit he’s eating
Ok so I am only on day 20 but can’t you craft shucker boxes either the 4x4 grid?
warzone 100 drops?

“Overworld normies” lol
Do 3000 days in mine craft hardcore
y
i was trying to do this
You need to do 100 days in the normal world🙂
Can't believe I just watched a man mine end stone for 30 minutes...   Great vid as always man!
where did he get the torch tho
So question how did you tell when a day passed or when it’s night it always looks like night in the end Love your videos btw
do 100 days skyblock
If you want us to stop quoting you make your sentences less notable
Looks like he's running out of content, so just do 200 days
is this 100 real days or minecraft days
You said you’re more creative then us your actually meaner then us
How many different words for punch does he know
Do a 100 days in the ocean
Luke makes all his 100 days videos 30 minutes and 1 second long just to trigger us all
30 minutes and one second*
Number 1 on trending not bad 😎
NGL I didn't really enjoy this 100 days. I would have been okay if you had taken a crafting table with you to the end. At least then you would have had more to do and build and would have made things a little more enjoyable. There's only so much you can do for 100 days with just the inventory crafting menu and you basically did all of it in the first few days. I always enjoy the game progression throughout the video but there didn't seem like there was much progression. Enter, find end cities, use that loot to kill dragon, use existing blocks to build a little with, kill dragon. idk, just my opinion.
100 Days- One chunk... please
0:36 the message says that you're in survival mode
U can break Endre chest fr obsidians
Can you do a 100 days in a forest
24:00 good idea you should do that
Please do 3,000 days :(
at the beginning you can really hear that white noise
I'll do this sometime ig
Do 300 days in all dimensions
23:06 Luke: can't make pane My brain: Can't make pane but can make pain
Was Luke slowly going nuts IRL during this??
I FORGOT TO COME BACK AT 11 😀
So it’s every smp reversed
Fr tho where’s the torch from
Luke: fights ender Dragon without killing and leaves  Ender Dragon: am I a joke to u

Idk if you were using satire or not, but I personally believe Heaven is real, and since you are pretty much a mainstream YouTuber saying "Heaven isn't real" is not really respecting my opinion or any others of people who also believe Heaven is real, so next time it would be really great if you keep your opinions to yourself.
Me: "How could 100 days in the End possibly be entertaining? You can barely do anything." Luke:
Why the thumbnail built like that
Next up 100 days in minecraft caves

Quick tip you must thrown a pearl on the bridge then eat the chorus fruit and it Will teleport back on the bridge
You should do this again but you do one thing different. 1st option you get 10 dirt and a sapling. The 2nd option you get the first day to gather all the supplies you want from the overworld.
I didnt notice the hiss til u mentioned it, my guy
I love your hardcore Minecraft! 1 To 2000
Right now I have 16 ender hurdles lol
No mods?!!!??????!!!?!
how u get ladders
How did you get that torch?
“I hate quake pro”  Me who uses quake pro: “uh yeah definitely man..”
Next up: Minecraft nether: 100 days
Where DID the torch come from? Have I forgotten a way to get torches in the end? Are they on the end well?
Who else really wish they could do this but on day 30 get bored and watch a new Minecraft video and make a new one

What how did you not die ?????????????????????¿?
this guy actually sucks at ths game ngl
Finally!
Useless
moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!
He died, and respawned and did creative three times, this wasn't really a hardcore, it was a simple survival world with cheats on, there was also an end city portal at his first end city, as he killed ender dragon using command.
"The only flowers i have"
he should redo the nther and end ones, but in his 3000 days and he needs to do underwater
How is he going to get netherite
I love the thumbnail. Nom nom nom

I find it a little bothersome that he's complaining about inventory space, and yet had tons of chulker shells...
first placeable block end rod                                                                                                               chorus block
I just realized that LTN was a halo YouTube I used to watch years ago and that made my day
Me: 4 deaths later, 2 lost elytras later I finally have an elytra at home.  Luke : Doesn’t die for 100 days and gets tons of elytras
YASMYAS YAS ENDER
Nether was tough, but the End...            Ez
"I still love reading comments, it's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me. They see it, yup they're doing it right now, qoutin' me in the comment section, in my own video".  Get rekt luke
How do u know wat day it is without the sun and the moon well the end is just like space and the nether is HELL
3000 DAYS, 3000 DAYS, 3000 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Do you see it? yep, they're doing it right now, quoting me, in the comment section , on my own video."
The sad part is there is a dark void you can fall in. It’s just very hard
can you only be in the end I was about to say you can go in the nether
3:33 Luke: i am stuck on an island Also Luke: pretend to not see the portal gate way - Luke TheNotable 2021 stuck in the end
100 day minecraft mod minecraft
My guy breaking glass with a pickaxe
For a door you can use a half slab and put a banner on that. You have to shift every time you enter your base, but it's a door!
I’m honestly surprised why didn’t the make a house with the cities (at least not the begining
You could have used iron doors
Pls Do 200 days with tors pls
I can’t even get an elytra in normal survival worlds
12:07: yeah I guess he do tho
Ohh man Another Video Of 30 Mins And 1Sec
While Everyone Installs Mod Packs That Spawn Them In The End   Luke Does It In The Notable Way

mine the nomarl cheat and kilk shulker for shulker box
Baby shark I only know…14:41
Do one block survival
Pog new video
200 days with the Toris
The varying levels of existential angst and horror are the cherry on top of Luke's good humour and running commentary.
Ayyeeeee lets go new uploadd!
bruh i spent 7 hours trying to find a end city but luke get 3 elytras in a  day
I don't like ur floor design
17:13sooo anyone not gonna notice what he said orrrr
Sky block next pls
Survive 100 days pure underwater, no surface, only air pockets you can make
Don't know why he didn't get more chest in the 1st end city
Big brain irea, he could have made his floor out of glass because enderman can't teleport onto glass
Fizzy banger is exposing your vids

I guess this is THE END of these 100 days videos!
100 days far lands please
This uploaded 24 hours after it was supposed to
Hi Luke I have been subbed since 760k I’m really happy how much you grown
Challenge accepted
Idk why but his face reminds me the picture for in the air tonight by Phil Collins
I dont want to get sued for copyright for copying the challenge
he stole the 100 days thing from Luke TheNotable
Where'd he get a ladder
Wait I thought ended pearls don’t travel faster than you do
I’m only watching day 20 but rn I’m in pain he hasn’t made shulkers
love the vids
How the heck did he get a torch!?!?
You should play nether though
What about 100 days in space?
Luke:why aren't I flying I should be flying Me:your wearing the chest plate
What a lovable madman.
Have u tried playing mc impossible mode?
at 28:13 the endship looks like a dragon AMOGUS
Lost me when he said heaven doesn’t exist, immediately clicked off
How tf did he get iron trapped doors? 25:57
Alternate title: Luke just goes to end cities for 25 minutes then fights the dragon
My bros name is luke
Will there be a 3000 days hardcore
Noice
Among us Minecraft dead body reported iron amour is dead lether amour be like it's diamond all amour be like lether sus
Nobody notices the ladders in his inventory
I ain’t insane, I’m Notable   Lukethenotable
Why did he never think of shulker storage
I like it sooooo And it’s about your floor
Wow
Make 200 days in the end again
I service 100 day
HII LUKE YOU ARE THE AWSOME
How did he know what day he was on?
Finally
It’s actually rly true that people just quote him and get clout
17:08 that's the END of this... hahahahhhaha ha?
Next should be 100 drops/games in bedwars
Yessssssssssss Finally I was waiting for this And finally the day has come
That's a very notable monument...
“Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me”-Luke the notable
it would’ve been cool if he used the better end mod
My sister asked if i wanted a pound of red cherry gummy bears so yea ._.
Do 200days and the notables will help.
I liked the house
Just leaving my mark to edit in the future
I remember Luke said in 2,000 that he would go to 3,000 when the Caves and Cliffs update came out. I was excited think that would actually, but then realized that if he did, he wouldn't very many new goals to go for during that 1,000 days
Where did the torch come from????
Mmmmm
How is Luke not verified?
Less than 1m in 9hrs, what happened to this man's standards boys
A M O N G U S
Did you die in your hardcore 2000 days I'm confused
In bedrock edition, crafting tables sometimes spawn in end cities 🤣
Ph1lza has been outclassed

Plot twist: Someone did the LTN moon ritual

HE SCROLLS MEMES WHILE BRIDGING, HE IS TRULY A MAN OF CULTURE
You no you should probably get a Minecraft skin instead a default skin
Wait but how did he get the torch and ladders?
27:12 Adolf Brickler
If you press f3 I think you can see what day your on
“No” -some wise man on mars
Pro tip: if you angle your camera at 40° and -40° while flying you will have infinite momentum
Heaven is real
i tried to live in the nether after a week i gave up
Luke- " I would kill a baby village for shulker box  Me screaming at my phone- "chest + 2 shulker shells = shulker box U HAVE 11 SHELLS N 2 CHEST LUKE USE THEM 🤣"
I bet u use the “cheating technique” in ur 1000+ hardcore¿?
Ltn you can breed with the endermen
How did he get the torch?
Finally
I thought he was using better end lol
Luke I’d not walled inside yet
Yes
3000 😐
THE END COTY SHIP WHAT    Th e chorus fruit also teleport to the nearest solid block
Would you be down to do 200 days if you had one sapling one dirt and one water or something
11:54
3000 days
When he said "punch! hit! jab! slap! sock!" I felt that 😔
I also tried living in the end but it wasnt hardcore and it wasnt for 100 days. I did beat the game though! (and I did record for a video)
thanks mcdonalds lmao
Alternative title : how i turned 6 minutes of a fight to 40 days
damb
The house looks nice
The End Base is better than me building for a month straight.  That's definitely something I said.
You really deep throated your mic
50% adult 50% competent 100% notable
Let's go
200 days?
11:03 nice Led Zeppelin reference
I try that last year and got bored in 3 minutes
is it just me or is luke slowly getting crazier?
Can you do 3000 days on your other hardcore you had emerald mansion
Diamond is kinda sus
11:54 HE DID THE THING, HE DID THE THING!!!!
I really like your house design
you are pro
poggers
You should try the aether dimension obviously if you want
I think u can make endstone stairs i think
11:55 The best part of the video
Wait so why didn’t he make shulker boxes??????
Who agrees about 3000 days regular
When you need end mod pack. But without it rip
Hey Luke I have a question. Are you going to continue your super flat series?
you could have gotten wood in the nether
poo poo house :)
11:51 🤖🤖🤖
HAPPY 4TH EVERYONE, including u Luke
You are the king of the 100 day 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 2000 where waiting for 3000😑
HE CAN GET SHULKERS I CANT PLEASE JUST MAKE SHULKERS
At 9:40….. Luke is the only person probably in the history of the world who has ever said here I will put some of my more useless items LIKE DIAMONDS
How this guy remember the days without any sun?!
21:14 challenge accepted
Can’t wait for 100 days modded
*noted*
You relize in setting you can change it so you just spawn in the end And that will be the only biome
He did a better job at building in the end than me in creative

18:09 LMAO
Guys he got the torches from the end portal
You are Insane!!
Lol I’m watching this on a vacation   I’m in Wisconsin lol I’m Illinois hat
The complex ethiopia seasonally wreck because push frustratingly bore onto a two cereal. probable, wistful dorothy
17:04 did he say a bad word?
When he said from all the inbreeding I started dieing best joke ever
Low key thought he meant he died on his on the 2000 days world
Wait but how did he get the torch?
Can you do more things with the tors
u get lucky in these 100 day survival do u cheat?
11:56 HE SAID THE IMPOSTER MEME!!!!!!!!!!
Yesss
Where waiting for your 3000 day
Hi how are you I've been Watching your videos I'm actually 1 of your fans 😂😂
I love it
18:09 oh no oh no oh no no no no no
*confused Luke noises
It's sounds like a fun challenge but if I did it. I would have to at least spawn myself a single crafting table.
Hey after this MAKE A BLOODY 3000 DAYS ON HARDCORE MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why not shulker boxes? You have chests and shells.
survive 100 days on debug mode lol
A M O N G U S A M I R I G H T ?

Are we ignoring the fact that he has a kid now?
When your not early your just at the right time
I luv the drawing on the cover!🌟🌟
When does 3000 days come out?
this is the best channel
stop uploading these. you can’t prevent the inevitable. give us 3000 days
Cool

Your floor looked really good! Keep up the good videos!

You should do 100 days in jungle

Ha you can put Dragan head on your head to avoid enderman
Just waiting until he figures out about the 1.20 update in 2023 that updates the end with like 6 new biomes and revamps bows 😂
WOAH!! COOL!
"they're doing it right now, quoting me. In the comment section of my own video"- Luke TheQuotable 2k21
Wait where did the torch come from? Ladders?  Also, I remember day 80 - 90 from the premier XD
Become one with the end people
why are there videos every month?
Next up: 100 days in the aether dimension That would be pretty notable to see
When people call luke insane for doing 100 days end no mods  LUKE:I am not insane I am notable
"They're doin' it right now, quotin' me. In the comments section, on my own video."  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Luke : i challenge you to live in the end  I'm not gonna live in the end until mojang update it
New vidio idea 100 days in hardcore mincraft in a cave or the ocean
Did anyone else see the ladders? Because that is sticks and sticks are WOOD.  LIKE SO LUKE CAN SEE
11:55 amogus
LTN- *uploads 100 days randomly* this is becoming easy  SB737-  you fool
When the chorus is planted! 😳
there is seeds in the end cities  and I live in the philippines so when I was fast asleep, the premiere started (1 am)
hi
3:40  Nope. Not in Korea anymore.
hi
.hi
Everyone ignoring how he made a literal weed farm in his basement
make 100 days in pixelmon
Day ur mom 3:17
When and where can we find the NFT? :D Please say on WAX :D:D:D
hi
Only Luke would use Alex,make alex a monument and also make it a staple of his chanelle...  also Luke if ur reading this u better not change your skin
lets be honest here we all thought this video was the end of the 100 days series for a split second
Luke is someone who not copy the others
.cool
What was worse the end or the nether?
Put a skin🤣😂
...okay, but where DID he get the torch?
3 on trending
i was thinking the entire time... "make a shulker box T-T"
Does anyone notice that he could be using the shulker boxes to put in the ender chest so he has more storage
among us 11:55
i think the monument kinda looks like Hitler
5:32 "And I wrote this down, this is true, my infant daughter had a nasty poo, so I had to go."      ok then
Yoooo #1 trending!!!
I love the fact that he says literal flight feels a little "stone age"
" i did it with one hand haha haha" luke extremely sus
Luke is acting sus o-o he said 'ender balls'
make a freaking shulker box lukeee
So this video was fake
He survived 100 days in the end without dying once poggers
you should also make your floor slabs and then it will be a full 3 blocks but endermen cant spawn on slabs
Was I the only one who had a heart attack thinking this was the end of his hardcore world?
Why didn't he use shulker box??!!!?! HEHHHHHH
Some people that are not subed: I don't like your floor  Me: u need to sub and btw I like your floor luke the notable 100%   Stay notable
OMG I JUST SAW HE GOT #1 ON TRENDING—           GG
Ok but how did he get the torch?
11 m subscribers left you got this luke!
wow
You should have given yourself one sapling and one dirt
I will like evreone
I read a book yesterday after dinner.
the endermen D:
i seriously want you to do 100 days on skyblock just classic skyblock not 1 block skyblock to make it interesting
Wow he was right half the comments are just video quotes
Luke rocks
When is 3000 days ? (Or are you doing it)
💯💯💯💯
Luke : has 11 shulker shells : Also Luke : Dosent think about making shulker boxes
Dude hit the head of the dragon to deal more damage and stand in the bedrock thingy to not get launched in the air (just make sure you don't jump)
Without cheats
Hew Moran: That's debatable
Luke is the best mc survivor i know
He died like 3 times how he still here its hardcore
Ayo when is 3000 days coming
I have no idea why i have 57 likes haha
100 days without a crafting table
Where’s 3000 days????!!!!
I subed to you Luke
aaa I want Hardcore Minecraft 3000 days to be uploaded
I wish he did this on 1.18 the end update (not 1.17.2)
The reason some of your hits on the dragon didn’t work was because of its buggy hit boxes. Try hitting it in the head
Luke you are a jerk
"useless idems like diamonds" those few words are just no
Why dind't you make a shulker box
Less go #3 on trending again
Pick a bimo like bad lands and do 100 days without leaving it
These playthroughs are good tests to see what works and what doesn't. The 100 days in the nether video and then doing it myself made me appreciate the nether update so much more. The nether still needs a boss and one more structure but you can play there no problem. This video just shows how much of an update the end needs! There's nothing to do!
NOW KNOW I CAN KILL
ehh pretty sure 3000 days is 30 of these 100 days challenge
Try and survive 100 days in the sea so basically stay in water for 100 days and yes you can go to the surface to breathe. (You must always touch water)
What if you did this challenge with a data pack which allows wandering traders to spawn in the end with two added trades, being zombie spawn eggs and lava buckets?
keep eating chorus fruit and you are a ender man (i mean really by game theory)
Luke hitting endermen Me:.... Ranboo....
Luke, just a idea but you could do 100 days on a multiplayer world that your fans can join sorta like a smp
How he make chest
LTN, the iron helmet with protection four is the same as a diamond helmet with no protection. Each half of an armor bar is 4% less damage, each protection level is 1% more defense. Having a full set of unenchanted diamond armor drops the damage you take to 20%. Full protection 4 on each piece divides the damage you take by five once more. And on java, the durability armor has affects it's damage reduction.
I know amongus
Hi W do you know if it’s a new day
100 days in a modded biome
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I thought this was the end of the minecraft vids or the og 100 days lmao
Cool
No my boy 22:34 now it's notable

honey wake this kids LTN posted
Plss
Go to fortnite chapter 2 season 7 came 4 week
The end of the notable one
Hi Luke. Could you make a 3000 day ep of your hardcore world.
first
Hello Luke
I have been waiting for this :) 😊
when u don´t want  to do 3000 days:
WOW BRO
11:54
Yes the notable guy who started  the hardcore trend
100 games airship "among us"
17:16 lmao
Wow I hate your floor design
when 200 days with tors ive been waiting forever
You have kids 😯
if you're wondering how he got the torch, in the bedrock center of the end island (what u use to enter the overworld) there are 4 torches in the middle!!
im still wondering why he did npt make an anvil at the beggining
I didn't watch the trailer because i wanna surprise myself and i thought hes gonna use a mod
ranboo would be proud
Do 200 days in the end now
please do, 100 days on latin america
you could have ended in day 10
LUKE THERE ARE CHESTS IN THE END SHIP
Do 100 days on skyblock
Okay cool but… where u got the torch from?
8 hours ago! YEY im so LATE!
With the Iron you had you could have made an anvil to combine tools and you could have made shulker box with the chest and the Shiller drop
DONT LIKE     its at 69k likes
9000 days in  Minecraft 1.17
Ayyyyy
This is luke slowly going insane cus nether is easier it has trees
That house was actually very nice and I would live there. Nice work :3
BRO SHUT UP YOUR THE BEST IN THE WORLD LOVE YOUR VIDS
I liked the house, resembled a lot an End city's styled home considering it was also made from literally that.  The Cult of the Crafting Table on 2B2T would probably even more praise the Crafting Table with a playthrough like this.
10:57 that line was the best lmao
Fr how’d he get the torch tho?
That monument looks a tad angry and a tad german
26:44 lmaooo
did luke say his 2000 days house was ugly😤😤😤😤
You should try to beat the wither or the ender dragon with only wooden tools       Just an idea.
“I wish I could make slabs” *chorus fruit just sitting there*
How did he get the torch and the ladders?
iv done 1000 days in the end also you need to hit the head/ front of the dragon to hurt it
Ayyyyyy Luke good job
Wait actually where di he get the torch
Sus armor: 11:55
This was just 100 days of depression.
where do i perchase the nft
Best.Birthday.Ever
13:43
At least he didn't do 100 days in creative... Oh wait
do 200 days when there is a end update
“Most of you just quote me!” - Lukethe Notable 2021
Mr. Notable! You *MUST* continue. There are so many other end cities to raid! So many Endermen to fight! So many ... uh ... uh ... islands to visit! Yeah - you didn't visit enough islands!
Yes
Hey.. advice, use the iron in the end cities to make an anvil and creat perfect items. STOP NEGLECTING RESOURCES!!
YES NEW VID
Guys i heard that if u say a creators name 3 times they pin you!!!  Luke TheNotable  Luke TheNotable  Luke TheNotable
Anyone who says he cheated cause the torch just remember that torches spawn on the bedrock pillar for the dragon
Ltn: useless items like diamonds  People who are obsessed with diamonds and use them for everything in Minecraft: DIAMONDS?! USELESS?!
11:53 oh god no he's 9
Luke Do 100 Days In An Old World. That Was My Idea But I Don't Have Time
By the way, you can actually just use the command “/setblock ~ ~ ~ end_portal” to get to the end instead of building the entire portal yourself.
Im more concerned on how he got a torch;-;
before 1m
I love it
The Enderman in the thumbnail is like “And then he turns himself into a pickle.”
3:43 HOW DID YOU GET THOSE LADDERS MY GUY
15:29. There was a portal back to the end island. Beat ender dragon at day 40.
WHERE DID HE GET THE LADDERS
If You Got A Chance Of Getting A Flint And Steel You Can Finnaly Go To The NETHER And Get Wood And Stone
Use the nether for wood
Did this with my friends last month. it was a lot of fun would recommend
Did anyone else predict that he will get items form the end ship
3000 days plz
🔥
What else can luke the notable do?
Spoiler : He turned into an enderman.
Luke, your content is awesome but.. That thumbnail is absolutely horrid.
Yes ... how did you get a torch ?
minecraft 100 day king is back 👏👏
You are so cool
why didnt he just make shulker boxes 🥲
CURSE OF VANISHING IS IT GOES WHEN U FIE
Can't wait for 3000 days
He always make perfect time on the video always 10:00 or 20:00 or 2:00:00
this is the reason why luke is notable
How did I think of this before him
I am your biggest fan luke theNotable
LUKE THE DAD
Ur upload schedule sucks lol
AlWaYs qUotINg mE iN My OWn CoMMeNt SeCtioN
Do a 3 thousand days
I love the house :). Also the wall :).
Hello. Plz say hi🤘🤛
Just asking why don't he craft a shulker chest     Wait,I realised he don't even have wood
HE ACTUALLY DID THIS BET HE CANT DO IT ON 1000 DAYS OF THE END
Ahh yess , a suitable content for me
Ah yes a 30:01 video
Can you do 100 days pixelmon
Kinda like your house design
Damn you gotta love the transition at 17:19
You can tell in the day 70’s he just does random, useless stuff because he’s so bored of the challenge and knows there’s only a few days left.
POV: Charlie tries to copy LTN
Do 200 days in the end
You cheated to get those ladders on day 6
Respect to you Luke I would be bored out of my mind
I was close to defeating the ender Dragon but my sister played my world on creative then I didn't get the achievement when I did 😭😭😭
Everyone gangsta untill mojang adds Luke as a boss
Quotin him. In the comments section. On his own video.
WE NEED 200 DAYS!!! :DDD
Luke you could of went to the nether
“Im bursting” LukeTheNotable 2021
"Yep, they're doing it right now, quoting me, in the comments section. Of my own video." - Luke TheNotable 2021
2:41 ok eminem
wait why don't you make a shulker box :>>>
... where did he get wood from for his chest ... COINIDENCE? I THINK NOT
Also you should put some slabs on the floor so it’s three blocks tall but Endemann can’t Spawn
Game Theory's theory on endermen being ancient humans suddenly seems a lot more plausible after seeing Luke use chorus fruit to teleport.
Welcome to the end challenge where elytra are more common then Iron and trees
"Hello, I'm Luke TheNotable and welcome to the end."  *Video ends*  Me: Then where are the rest of the days?
How do you keep track of the days in the end?
Ahh yes 100 days in the void that sounds fun
I joked about him doing this. Next thing I know, HE DID IT! BTW, the comment I made was in the Hardcore Nether video
i love his vid and a good player people make memes about him to
“My worthless diamonds”  This is something that only Minecraft gods can say
It sucks none of these hit like the OG tho still good
AMONGUS
Thanks McDonald's
100 days ocean
Trend the Luke
idea: 100 days in a crimson forest only world -aggressive zogin -iron can only be found in bastion and fortress -food is rotten flesh, edible loot and mushroom(but zoglin patrol the ground)
Tf how did he get item frames when there's no sticks or leather
!!!Disclaimer!!!   2000000 endermen were harmed while doing this video
"All you do is Quote me"   -Luke TheNotable
100 Days - [Minecraft Skyblock] (please :) )
“Yeah ya see it? They’re quoting me right now!” Well darn
THY END IS HERE!!!
luke the notable is the best cant wait for 3000 days !!!!
i clicked faster than…. idk
Well I mean there’s no way to tell whether heaven exists so I call shenanigans on that claim that heaven doesn’t exist
Wow ok

wow hearing luke say that diamonds are worthless sounds so strange to a Minecraft player.
hmm yes you know this is a hard challenge when diamonds are utterly useless
Another video from luke the notable with doing things that aren't 3000 days
Quotin me, in the comments section, on my own video

"Most of my comments just quote me'' -Luke TheNotable, 2021
"I ain't insane, I'm notable" Me trying to find out the difference
Shulker box ? Anvil ?
Where is one day Fortnite
Show us your mods folder you're too lucky.
It triggered me when luke was hitting the enderdragon at its buft, you should hit the dragon's head
Me: "I can do this!"   Also me who failed doing the Nether  challenge and always have a pumpkin on my head so I'm used to looking Endermen in the eye: " No you *can't* "
You should’ve not done a face reveal you would’ve had so many stans harassing you and bullying you into doing one, and why would you not want that
SUS Thumbnail
Idea for 200 days: Got to the overworld, do a normal playthrough (find the stronhold) but go back to the end with only a sapling (of every kind you can find) and dirt. This would allow tools to be crafted and the house / other build would look a lot better. As a goal for day 200, you could try to beat the wither on the main end island.   Im really trying to get you to give us the 200 days.
There is people out there with dirt huts still…
Mojangs getting ready to make the end livable now
Curse of vanishing only disappears when you die
That’s great but where’s Mando and Spire Assassin in one day?
Look did you know that you set spawn piont in the end and nether
100 days in aether
End crystals dont damage things under them or break blocks under them
End crystals dont damage things under them or break blocks under them
“Don’t get me wrong, I love reading comments but most of you are unoriginal and just quote me.” -LukeTheNotable, 100 Days in the End Dimension
Why is the end has no end
"oh and If I fall off I'm dead but there's more time in this video so you know that won't happen" Most notable thing I've heard
IVE WAITED THIS FOE 3 DAYSSSSSS    now this is content
Был бы у него бонусный сундук)
It wasn’t as hard since I spawned right next to a endcity

You should do Under ground for 100 days so you can’t touch the surface for the 100 days and when you spawn in you have to dig strait down
You're both insane and notable
The king is back. Wait HOW did he get a chest
One chunk 100 days
LUKE!
I miss your Fortnite content...
100 days in the ocean?
4000 days of hardcore minecraft?
Luke: I'm going to waste one of my perfectly good healing potions, to get some fresh gamer girl breath
people who disliked the video 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤮🤮🤮🤮
You can see what day your on, in the F3 menu
You could make the nether portal and then get wood
Luke sanity level lower than his wood count
Luke is probably the only person I watch during times I don’t do nothing.
luke talking about how much one sapling would change the game. dirt: you are nothing without me
“Luckily, I got lucky” *The floor is made out of floor*
100 days bedrock edition???
Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me
"Day your mom"
Why do you make an end portal luke like can’t you just use /execute?
Could have used anvils using irons to repair the pickaxe using diamond
i only sub to you cuz you dont use mod
Bruh chain commence
Did you die during 3000 days, Luke?
You know he works fast when you look away for 2 seconds and he has the foundation of a house done
I missed you man good to see you suffering again 🙂
Did you break your hand
This dude is the best Minecraft player ever
69 thousand likes nice
Listen, Body, if I get 1 drop of saliva in my lungs and I start coughing you do not need to expel my lunch onto the floor [happened today while watching this]
When in his mine taking about how he didn’t know his mic was on, did he say the S word? Idk why I find it funny seeing him as a somewhat family friendly channel
Bro ya know how people say the sequel is never better then the original no the 200 days is so much better LOVE the new house you made so purple
25:41 pp fruit
I was about to complain that he could make shulker boxes, but then I realized you need a crafting table. Wood blocks are the best
How do u know what day it is if the end is always night
Idea: 100 days in skyblock.
Next I’m expecting is 100 days in crazy craft
Good job on Luke for shouting out a smaller franchise👍
I LOVE THE FLYING SOUND HYOU MAKE
i love how its perfectly 30:00
3:19 day ur mom lol

The people who disliked are the ones who hated how he didn’t mine the ender chests
r u a dad?
sus
How’s you know that it was 100 days? Did you guess?
Hows the new baby btw and great video
I was here within the first 10 hours🤣
Your not the only one that uses the method
Could he spend 100 days on the Minecraft earth map? Just asking not demanding.
Awesome video as always!
AMONG US 11:53
11:02 DAM he really just said that 😳
Live in the ocean for a 100 days and do 3000 days or i wiil unsub
Luke TheNotable in dark mode is going to give me nightmares
Idea: fortnite 100 drops combat pro
So many end city you found like 32
“You see it? Yup, They’re doing it right now, quoting me, in the comment section, on my own video”
Should I put the iron helmet on? As the diamond one says 3+ and the iron says 2+
Sad you won't continue this, but still. . . If you ever need to make a Banner Door, try putting the banner on the ground rather than a wall. I don't know if oyu can go through it, but it was a thought I had.
IN THE END IT DOSENT EVEN MATTER!!!
Luke you are number 2 in trending right now
1000 days in end Minecraft, having a full diamond tower

"You're doing it right now, quoting me. In my own comment section."  -LukeTheNotable
I was really thinking I was so smart for thinking about making shulker boxes until halfway through I realised I was dumber than endstone...
How dare you Quake pro is the best
"did you see that? theyre commenting in the comment section, on my own video" - Luke TheNotable, 2021
Luke TheNotable + Wisp = 1000 Days of Furnaces being OP
So *this* is how the Endermen were made…
Are you still doing 3000 days of minecraft 😊🌮
Ltn out here trying to come up with every 100 days idea on the planet so he doesn’t have to do 3000 days
2:20 Punch, hit, yelp, strike, knock, thump, smack, pound, tumble, jab, slam, smash, hook…
Bruh eating an end fruit teleports you to the closest solid block within an 8 by 8 radius…
How did he get the torch
Luke you should do a 100 drops Catty Corner Fortnite season 7 a lot of chest spawns away from most of the madness you might like it
Hey Luke when is 3000 days coming?
“its just, most of you are pretty unoriginal and quote me” - Luke, 2021
Well, at least now you can go back to the overworld in 200 days
Tier 100 Fortnite, it’s been 3 Fortnite seasons
please do one block skyblock or regular skyblock
Cant wait for 3k days
100 days on the oldest Minecraft that you can find
The floor look nice
I just realized how does he know how many days he’s been in the nether or in the end world?
I love the floor
Luke will do a 100 days challenge for every dimension in the modding community before he does 3000 days
mans really just
You know what screw you *unwatched video*
Toycat did this too lol
Luke Luke Luke you can’t copyright 100 days your too greedy
Luke the notable is my favorite youtuber and has been for 1 year
6 hours 700k views #2 on trending. My guy came out of nowhere like he just sold paypal
Nah I’m not insane, I’m just bored.
when you a kid
"screw. you." * Un-watches video *
Wow, another notable 30 minutes of my life
When he asked what we thought the farm was I thought it was a meth lab
in your 2000 day world will there be 3000 days
"I'm building a road to the ender dragon!"   just use 1 enderpearl to go through the gateways near the city...
Everyone in the end: give me those diamond chests I am poor AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH *dead* Luke: at least I’ll have a spot to put some of worthless items like Diamonds
remenber heaven is real
The video is out!  Let's gooo
Like the only one that doesn't get notifications on this guy
What about like 6 pieces of dirt and 1 sappling? alot more intresting?
Luke: Don’t tell em the drug dealer gave me the ladders and torch...
“So quote me on my on video” - LukeTheNotable 3 hours ago
11:56
The better question is.   How was Luke capable of telling nor knowing which day it was?
You are wrong haven is real also frick you don’t you
Hello Luke I hope you are well keep what you do ☺️
POV: you didnt realize you could mine chorus flowers without silk touch
I kinda expected you to go through the end portal to be both a satisfying end and a final dot on your statement about not continuing this series as you were no longer in the end and you sure as hell wouldn't be going back oh well I guess the dragon death is a good end too
Why didn't he make an anvil?
Everybody is probably surprised that free the end was the third advancement.
Wait how did you get iron trap doors
You could of made a shulker box-
when is the three thousand dasys video
We need 100 Days [Minecraft Twilight Forest Dimension]
We all know that your a legend but please can you do 1000 days I beg you
Its this mans suffering through the harsh worlds of minecraft that make us want to play minecraft even more
18:17 dude you don't say that about ur descendants how bout if it actually happens?
Why are the survival hearts hardcore ones?
But….like… can you show us your baby daughter?? 🥺🥺 (Sorry babies are just really cute and I would understand if you didn’t want her on camera yet.)
Tho what’s woth 30:1 for some vid
"Very handsome man"
Ok
I'm pretty sure you can beat the enderdragon starting with nothing, all you gotta do is: 1. get some pearls from endermen 2. pearl on top of the pillars 3. punch out end crystals 4. punch out dragon Just a thought, sounds hard asf
when luke gets full enchanted diamond armor by day 20 out of 100 in the end, but you get leather boots by day 245 out of 2000 in easy mode
Waiting for the day Luke finds himself on the Hermitcraft server-
The creator of a 100 days❤️
If only he could craft shoulder boxes
It's kinda reasonable because he already did the neather
I tried living with my friend in the end We made a castle Now I'm living in the end
Try 100 days underground
This man is a true warrior, trying to make the end into decent content! I'm sorry for your suffering, Luke. Hopefully we'll get an end rework update soon.
poor ranboo
You didn't know about that?
Yes get him to 6.95M subscribers
69k likes NICE
Didnt even use optifine. How notable.
Where 3000 days I waiting so long!
I am going to try to survive 100 days in the end! This looked like a cool experience!
shulker boxes please
Everyone gangsta until Mojang adds Luke as a Boss mob
4000 day
First
Another one (would require water breathing as standard though): 100 days underwater
11:01 We can agree he means in the game, right? | :
if you are wondering why the sword did not work on the dragon Luke The Notable probably had knock back on it. I dont know why it is a thing but thats probably why.
10,000 days q

I thought this was the end of the series lol
Heaven is real and i hope we all get in jesus loves u i unddrstand it was  just a joke love u luke
Me seeing the likes “Nice”

I thought you died on the 2000 days world
Do 3,000 days
Wait a minute... The enderman kill you un hardcore mode but you respawn? 3:21
He's so notable he can upload this and everyone will still watch it
“And just quote me” Luke Thenotable-famous fortnite man says
u know you can just go to world settings and click "one biome" and scroll until you find End Islands and then click it and create the world and you can put the bonus chest to help if you want and when you create the world you spawn in the end islands, you dont really have to activate cheats
He’s really making anything but 3000 days
How did he get a torch in the end for real?
Seriously how is there torch in end?
Okay Then
Way not make Choker box
Quoting me
I can't believe he went the whole hundred days without realizing that End cities have crafting tables in them
"What did he do with the other hand,hahahah,scrolled memes" that made my day
This is the most notable challenge I’ve seen from you
Noice Pretty bland 1st day: watched the void, quite nice Edit: nobody’s ever called diamonds useless :/
100 days in astroneer
It’s finally here
So are you going to do 100 days of Amplified? It’s one of the few vanilla things left you could do iirc
Do 100 days in minecraft bad lands
The fact he spent 100 days without a crafting table
LETS GO
U won't like this comment
Wait, your telling me you missed the chance to say you made the yellow brick road in the minecraft end? The end stone bricks are yellow, I mean, I wouldnt do it, you would have to be insane to do this challenge, but hey im just saying yellow brick road in the end
You could of mined the chest and made a shulker box
My inspiration
just like ibxtoycat
he should do a 100 drops bedwars
"You guys are unoriginal. You just quote me." LTN - 2021
We would like to see 3000 days Luke so plz do it
Last one here at the premiere. Send me money $zekeriesgo
I would probs clap them the notable said Me:AYOOO LOW KEY SUSSS
My pc isnt working but this made me happy
“Quote me in the comment section on my own video.”
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
“Most of you are pretty on original and just quote me”
For the house you should have made the floor slabs. Endermen can't teleport onto bottom slabs nor can they spawn on them
Let’s get it day 3,000 overworld
3000 plz
Minecraft ain't for children
14:54 actually, yesterday I saw someone do 100 days in the end..i dont think it was completly 100 tho so maybe you are
When he got that torch and that scene all I could think of was that one chad meme.
You could just go to single biome in world options and choose one of the end biomes
Day 36 is you take the shulker shells you could of made shulker boxes with the chests and would of had a hella lot of storage
Play it again
My most viewed video on my channel is hardcore in the end
“Did ya see it? There doin it right now! Quotin me!” Luke
Luke has a kid
Do 100 days in hard core Minecraft but it’s 800 days
I’m at 10:05 and I’m screaming in my head MAKE SHULKER BOXES
The video was great… until he sung baby shark😂😂😂😂
101 days in the end
You should try a 100 days on the Aether mod... Just a suggestion
I tried the surviving a hundred days in the end I died by the third day
end city on day 92 looks like a dinosaur haha
He said his chest plate is missing thorns 3 lmao
You’ve heard of netherite, but what about enderite?
Sick
Yo
1.19 end update?
Ok
I'm far more creative than you. Yeah, how many failed trademarks do you have, cause I have 2 -Luke TheNotable
YOOOOOOOOOO FUCKING POST 3000 DAYS DAMMIT LOL
Listen, the reason Luke isn't doing 3000 days is because Part 2 of 1.17 didn't come out yet and he said "I'll be playing that in 3000 days!" So expect 3000 days around November or December.
how does this man even keep track of his days?
why didn't you make shulker boxes?
it was a pretty good day, but you uploading made it a GREAT day!
I like it its nice
100 days in minecraft bedrock edition?
Go to 200 days
LTN u shoul try doing 100 days adventure mode
LTN in a month 100 days -[minecraft Aether]
11:53
You died pretty easy
Add wood to your homes (joke)
When you doing 3thousand days in minecraft
Video idea. I mined for 100 days
I played in 1.0
Like got the torch from dragon island on the portal that's how you get in the end
I already know the next 100 days is gonna be 100 days in the Aether or 100 days in the Twilight
Slice, Dash, Swipe, I, Just, Googled, these, words.
He just shows himself casually doing blackface at the beginning
Day 34 I saw a portal to dragon
Finally ur back
does luke not know how shulkers r made.................
You could've built a nether portal near the dragon and gone to the nether to get wood?
I'm starting to think luke the notable lost the 2000 hardcore world
“You’re doing right now you’re quoting me”-LTN
You could use iron trapdoors and iron pressure plates for the door!
yes the power has gone to far first the nether now the end
Can we get the original 100 days on trending
Can’t wait for Minecraft end update part "69"   ngl
100 Days in a Desert only world
Eating chorus fruit every day would be so painful 😓
OMG  I atempted 100 days in the end, and I spawned on an island with an end city! And I got silk toush unbreaking mending pic, with a knockback 4, sharpness 2, sword
i shall now quote him. : " Don't get me wrong, I love reading comments its just you're really unoriginal and just quote me. yeah you see it? yeah? their doing it right now. Quoting me. in the comments section. On my own video. "
No way I'm repeating this challenge
why only pick up end chest? What about normal chests?
This is want I like to call stalling
It’s my girlfriend’s birthday
Yay
Alright let’s see what I can make this interesting oh shi my mic on - Luke TheNotable
I think Luke evolved into an enderman tyrant while eating nothing but chorus fruit and breathing in the void for 100 fays
I literally cheated this challenge and got dirt and saplings and still died
I really couldn’t care less if he went in creative or not. For me its not all about the hardcore its kore about the narration
absolute madlad
Pov you are luke trying to read your comment section and the only two comments are quotes from the same ten seconds of the video Lol
Why didn't he use chests to make the shulker boxes?
E
Just me who is doing this and gonna give a little starter pack since I’m used to using a controller
stay notable!
So 3000 days
Liking for "Day Your Mom"
your vids are so good!
Still waiting for 3000 days hardcore Minecraft
“Yeah you see it? Yup, they’re doing it right now, quoting me, in the comments section, on my own video.” -Ltn

Time to go unwatch a video
why didn't he make the floor slabs and the roof as high as he wanted it 🤦‍♂️
Why didn't u go in tye nether and get wood
Love u vids keep up the good work
I like how his face is so notable, yet he doesn’t use his face as his minecraft skin, and instead uses one of the default skins.
yea stay notable like luke.
I have been waiting for 3 days
Try 100 days in bedrock edition
It seems i got unsubbed somehow.maybe its better that u make an public poll bro
I'm not so noteable and I trying to be cool and make a brand so : luck give me a baby !!.  Did it work I'm cool ?
So does that mean were getting 200 days in the nether  Proper hope so
why do you sound like a pumpkin pie?
Bruuuuuuuuhhhhh
I fucking missed it
Everyone gangsta until it's impossible to get a crafting table
9:30 bruh he actually wanted thorns III 😂
This is nice
This is why the end needs another update
nice house
Where did the ladders come from at the start
Who thought this was 3000 days?
Yo
You should try having one day in the over-world normal then for the rest of whatever 100 day survival you do it's just that
All that ender cheese
can you go to the nether
Wait so why didn't he make shulcker box's
YOU SCARED ME  I thought this was the last video of the series and I was so confused why it was 100 days
YEEEEEEWEEEEEEES
You have to copyright every word you say so people don’t quote it
wonder what he did with his other hand hmmm
Can you please do Nether or End in the next vid ;-;
Bruh
It kinda annoys me how he doesn’t have a custom skin
“Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me” Luke TheNotable 2021
Me: dieing 10000 time in minecraft hardcore Nuke: surives 100 days in the end Me: Are you hacking Nuke: I am a ultra pog gamer 😎

"I'm building a stairway, not to heaven though. That dosent exist"
Just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me  -LTN 2021
This video just proves Mojang has to update the end
"i still love to read the comments just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me" LTN
Does anyone remember luke wore the diamond chestplate and it had curse of binding and he still got to use the elytra  Edit : it was curse of vanishing sorry

Do fortnite 100 drops abducter/mini mothership
You're doing it right now, you're quoting me!  Me: SHIT, I'VE BEEN CAUGHT
I bet you can't beat the game on hardcore mode with only a brobot controller  Here is the layout that I suggest: the left right arrows would be to turn the camera, the up-down buttons would be to move, the listen button would break and attack, the speak button will place blocks, and the music button would be to eat and yes I know with this layout you would not be able to turn the camera up and down but that's what would make it more challenging
27:13 That looks like a guy I know he is a Austrian painter
Congrats, you are notable to practically everyone on youtube
Next please 200 days with the tors
Are you just never going to do 3000 days?
26:02 All that Enderman wanted was a friend
He’s not luke the notable he’s luke the quotable 🤣
28:14   Am I the only one that thinks the end city looks like a dinosaur ?
why didnt you make a shulker box?
Do 200 days in the nether
11:54 amogus

PLEASE DO MORE NETHER PLZZZZZ I BEG U IT WAS SOO GOOD
Amongus
Luke: “They’re doing it right now! Quoting me! In my own comment section!”
PLEASE HAVE 200 DAY IN THE END
He could have made shulker boxes
When is Lifeless Void dropping in Spotify?
9:41 can anyone tell me how he managed to get chests in the end? to my knowledge, i dont think you can find wood in the end anywhere :p
You always on trending when you upload and I love your content. Great video you are awesome
I don’t understand why everyone was so mad at him for trying to copyright 100 days. It was his idea and honestly people  are always stealing content
i like this vid. but where is the normal 100-300 days
Oh sorry I forgot that those chests in the end city
Ooooh after when u killed the dragon i was thinging tht rhere will be srcond part (somethink like 200 days or 500

Ok

Yo  my guy luke the notable gonna do a series spending 100 days in caves.
He, he does realise that he could have made shulkerboxs with the chests in his base..
Luke seemed way more depressed then usual in this video, the again im not surprised, 100 days in the end would drive me insane, im gonna be suprised if he doesn't need therapy after this to recover from hearing nothing but endermen in a dark barnen landscape for over 100 days without out hope of ever seeing the sun, knowing he doomed to wander the darkness with a feeling of eternal emptiness forever. You know  the title for this video should've been 100 days in purgatory cause nothing else really fits that description.
Woah this i am early
bro how the heck do you do this stuff
Use a shulker box!
"Yeah you see it? Yep, they're doing it. Quoting me. In the comment section. On my own video."
not to be rude but, why did you decide to have the default girl skin?  Is there any story behind it?
LTN: He has a torch. He went into creative mode. I saw him  Me: there are torches on the portal
do a 100000 days piz
"can you see it? Yeah they're doing it right now quoting me"  - Luke the Notable
Community: *We want 3000 Days!* Luke: *We have 3000 days at home!* 3000 days at home:
"Most of your comments are pretty unoriginal, and just quote me . You see it? Yep they are doing it right now" -Not a quote I swear
18:15 has to be the best line of the video lmao
Sahvi actually did the end un modded before you
30 minutes and 1 second actually
“Yep, they’re doing it right now, quoting me. On my own video.” -Luke The not so notable 2021
LukeTN: See you in the next one  Me: I hope the next one is 3000 days Minecraft Hardcore
GET OUT OF MY HEAD!!!
People don't Care, When there in the end, Just Fighting the Ender Dragon.  Luke The Notable: Do I look like a Joke to you?
I was wearing headphones so the base boosted “ *AMONG US* “ scared the crap out of me
😂😂the thumbnail is so funny😂😂
Yoooooooooooooo
Imagine 	fru	 jepex 	mepic and lockdownlife watching this video they will be like i am trying it right now if it not so you can dislike this coment
the end sucks nether is amazing
A wall is peace of mind   -- luke thw notable
You could have made the end stone into end brick so it looks good and it would have only taken you some time but very little time indeed.
"I'm building a stairway! Not to heaven. No, that doesn't exist"  _oh really?_
Everybody gangsta until mojang adds Luke's house as an ancient build

You install a mode you can’t bilte the end partal
Omg I thought it said the end of 100 days phew
11:55 Am0nGuUs!?=

"don't get me wrong I still love reading comments it's just most of you are unoriginal and just quote me" -Luke TheNotable 2021
I just recently started watching your videos but I loved them immediately xd Which makes me really happy to say that, at least at the time of me clicking on it, this video is #2 trending on the gaming category
This Is Gonna Be Good
You can hold a looting sword in your off hand, and it will still have effect, even if you don’t use it!
do you like living in the end rather than the nether? And maybe make like 100 days Rebirth or something? Or 200 days for creative, superflat
Holy crap number 2 on trending
He complained about not have a shulker box but he drops the Shells for a new elytra🙄
U didnt make a single shulker box why?
Your not certified insane your certified GOD
hmmmm intresting
Love the vids man

Luke: "I need to kill alot of endermans. " Endermans: "OH HELL NA!"

Even tho he said what time he upload end i always late :(
Poopopopoopopopoppopool
Did you got bored at the end city
Do 3000 days
#2 on trending?? Congrats dude!
Maybe that's why ender men are like that, they got stuck in the end and got horribly disabled from all the inbreeding
Where’s 200 days with the tors?
the final design for your house is actually pretty good tbh for a casual builder with very limited resources
I tried to do nether survival in 1.15 minecraft. It didn't go well.
Yes finally
I tried this I lasted the amount of time the first tree u see on an smp
How about 100 days sky block?
Why do I feel this is an excuse not to do 3000 days
Half a million views in 5 hours. Wow daddy is popping!
GG #3 on trending!
Uhhhh
He got torches from the bedrock center of the ender dragon iland
Me realizing luck thenotable might be a minecraft noob even when he plays so much minecraft. Why I say that, well because he doesn't know your suppose to hit the head or neck of the dragon to damage properly. But he went for the legs and the but.
#2 on trending for gaming
Nuke LheTotable isn’t scary, he isn’t.    *help*
10:06 wait... how did he get the item frame?
where d i d he get the torch??
The nether was much better, don't do this ever again I beg you
"See? They're doing it, right now! Quoting me! On my own video!" -Luke TheNotable, July 3rd 2021
Don't you get torches from the end portal? Guess he forgot where he got where he gotthem from in the voiceover
3000 hardcore days???
Just do single biome and choose End Highlands
Luke u should have use the end crytal as a lighter to open the nether portal
I keep getting inspired to try to do this and I keep dying by day 10.
Are you ever gonna do 3000 days?
first time luke cussed
How in the single dangle fringle frangle frick did he do this
How about 3000 days
When are you going to make 3000 days Like if you want 3000 days
You're going to give us every possible variation of 100 days before you give us 200 with Tors.
He said u cant unwatch just remove from watch history
i was in a different state im happy i came home for this
Would anyone want a vote for 1.19 End Update
Luke did chya meet Ramboo?
He didnt want the ugly towers by his house, but made the road thing right next to it.
How does Luke only have 3.85 mil subscribers. He should have 100 mil
17:13 Comedy.
No kidding I was thinking about doing a vid like this and I thought oh well it would do good cause no one did it yet😂
100 days in the AIR
you know your rich when you say: "at least i have a spot to put my more worthless items, like diamonds."  9:40
We want 1000 days with Torrs 🥰
Hey Luke do 100 days of Minecraft in a cave
Plsss can. You make a 200 days for a series
STAY NOTABLE ;)
Imagine how game changing would it be if there was a wandering trader lmao
You should do 100 days on skyblock, that would be awesome!
"Quoting me, in my own comment section. In my own video!" - Luke TheNotable : 2021
If you hit the shulkers when they are closed u do no famage
You should have made a shulker box with the chest and shulker shells
100 days in floating island generator or caves (probably 1.8  version have this generator)
Luke’s always on trending 💯💯
15:23 rick sanchez? Is that you?
"i feel like even more people are quoting you now"  - me 2021
I'm not gonna lie it's good
hi
Man, Luke The Notable is really going the way of the MatPat lore.
Hey Luke, It is actually possible to beat the ender dragon with your fists by killing enderman and then using the ender pearls as projectiles to explode the end crystals and then using your fists to kill the dragon when it perches. Difficult but not impossible. (Like so he can see)
You should’ve done modded tbh
lets go man new video
Wait, ik he said it, but literally, how did he get that torch
This series is very addicting to watch again and again
18:00 not to be rude but check the armor bar it shows that the diamond helmet gives more armor bars than the iron helmet.
Luke: "forget the elytra" Luke later: takes elytra anyway
How Many People Still Waiting For 3000 Days
11:54 sus😳
3:20 day UR MOM
When will you upload the 3000 days video
Now other then 3k, 200 of the old ones and this one, you have two more things (flat land of the different varieties) and single biomes (overworld, caves, islands)

"Having to start the game with the ender dragon fight with nothing is difficult." Speedrunners: ...And I took that personally.
Amogus
Try surviving 100 days in hardcore on Fundy's impossible difficulty
A M O G U S
This is notable
Hi

:D
U need to work on 3000 days
Curse of binding in hardcore isnt a problem. Unless you find a better one after u put it on
„Whoooooiii“ -LukeTheNotable
this is nothing compared to some certain person's 5000 day series which is literally still going. just saying, no hate  oh yeah s'more info, i think they were pretty new to minecraft when starting it
You could have made a anvil to combine the armor to get the best
Where shullerbox?
Luke for the first 50 days: Why didn’t I think of ender chests  Me the whole vid: I wonder if he thought of shulker boxes  His nonexistent wood :…………………………………………………………………
The worst part? No Wood, to crafting bench, so much is gone.
Legend
Not to heaven that doesn’t exist
Shulker box question mak
I know he joked about this but seriously how did he get the torch?
Dear god notable try a 300 days with changing Dennison’s each one hundred days like start Verwoerd then end then nether or any order but no creative to change dimensions all survival thank you for your time great notable
25:41
am i the only one or doe i see something else 27:00
Can we like talk about how this got #2 on trending like fortnite get rekted
That entire time he could've used the end city chests and shulker parts to make a shulker box...
10:27 Saddam Hussein's hiding place:

Nobody: Luke with 3 ender Dragon heads
I want 3000 days pls
gg luke
If you had just a crafting table...but its so impressive you did it whit out crafting table
Will you still continue the nether world
Can we just talk about the fact that around a year ago luke wasn’t even good at surviving the first 20 days of overworld hardcore and now he has survived 100 days in the nether and with nothing he not only survived in the end but he slaughtered countless endermen taken over tens of end city’s gotten insane gear built a good looking house and slayed a dragon
why i am 99% sure the next 100 days will be with modded dimensions like aether
Wait…Luke said he dares us to survive 100 days in the end. BUT Luke sues anyone who makes a 100 days.  INFINITE MONEY
Fun fact. Heaven exists and there is proof of it :)
anyone know what episode he says “if it had a door it’s home” in?
finally
Love this
Maaan Minecraft is a game I love
i have watched  all your minecraft videos they are awesome! and thanks for taking your time and making it :)

Luke: i need more inventory space *Kills shulkers and mines chests*
I really hope you are working on 3 thousand days I have been waiting months for it. I really loved the video and the end house you made was neat

Do you remember me from roblox my user is ROBLOXISMEAN1200 or you prob seen it as YonYon well if u do i love your vids have a blessed day
I would watch a 200 days in the nether but not the end
You could've just pearled through a portal to get back to the main island
Hell yeah

If anyone were to play this challenge I bet they would immediately miss the wandering trader
100 days Minecraft Bedrock next pls
I dont get it WHERE DO U GET THE LADERS 3:46
"you are gonna watch me for the next 30 mins" me who watches in 2x speed
It hurt my brain thinking about why he didn't make shulker boxes to hold his loot.
Dully notable
I like the floor design.
Luke just gave a shoutout to McDonald’s :)
i know how im spending the next 30 minutes
100 Days Old World Next?

20:00 my man was crankin 90s

Hi bro can u survive 100 days in a mode it’s name flying mobs
In the end it doesn’t even matter
Flame arrows and fire aspect swords deal no damage to the dragon, I think.
ok but like, he knows there are multiple loot areas in the end citys right?
Do 100 days on skyblock
Just clicked and I’m excited af
Him killing the dragon made me cringe you can very easily kill it with his gear aaaahahhhhhhh why the tunnels
Am I an idiot or couldn’t he have have used shucker boxes
Tbh me seeing him find a pickaxe was the best thing in the video
what if he used the origins mod with this challenge
“Don’t get me wrong, I still love reading comments, it’s just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me”
where did he got the torch?
Where are the iron trapdoors in the end. Not being a critic, honestly curious.
I didn’t know he had a kid!!!!!
I was eating cereal and choked when I heard to sound of Luke saying “AMOUNG US”
This comment is for the youtube algorithm
Me: surviving in the end is imposible! Ltn: Or is it?
Luke how about you finish something before making a new one
End City's are the only source of things like swords/pickaxes and materials
Dezine*
You did it whit out craftingtable
the desine is pretty good goodjob
Please... get on with the original series
"You are pretty unoriginal and just quote me" LTN

Can you make 100 days irl?
Was it just me or did you think that he meant by the end was the end of the series.lmao
Instead of making a video every thousand day can u do it 10 at a time. And focus more on it
Luke: i dare u to do 100 days in end   Me: does it  Luke: sues me
I never thought I'd hear Luke call diamonds useless, I guess it took the end to break him of his addiction
420k views? Nice
Me when I found out luke had a child 😳

90% of viewers : why didnt you just give yourself wood or a saplin  LTN : ..............................no....
Used auto clicker and press w
How did he get the three ladders?
Video idea for you I played Bed Wars 100 times and this is what happend
No he’s right. He is more creative than us.
This is probably the only time your not happy for diamonds
This is better than I thought  he is amazing
is this where I point out that he could have made shulker boxes?
'don't quote me' Luke the notable 2021
i was at work when this dropped😔
100 days in a single biome world, that I would love or 200 days in skyblock, cause 100 is too easy I would say
It would take years in real life but he got ridiculously lucky he could mine up the end pillars and destroy the crystals then fist the dragon.
Ltn can make 30 minutes of the end more intresting then most 100 days
'violence is the answer' nono, its the question, and the answer is *YES*
LTN:I'm not insane, I'm notable. Me: yeah notably insane. (it's a joke)
wdym at 11:02
I only loot the ships lol imma loot the whole thing now lol.
27:12 heroinebrine
15:24 That sounds like rick from rick and morty.
Why did he not make shulkers on day idk
Technically you can build a base, have a food farm, and live in the end
IBXToycat was the first person to do this, actually
🤣 Luke you Hilarious
Dude I thought  of this a few weeks ago
epic this is great
NOOOOO I MISSED THE PREMIRE * CRIES  IN ADDICTED TO 100 DAYS*
I was waiting for this minute by minutes counting down
I know where to get torches, but where did he get the item frames?
100 days skyblock pls
11:55
14:57 Pretty sure Sahvi did that before
We need a Luke thenotable skin  that's like dreams just his face.
Dude instead of using ender chests u could have used shulker boxes
A m o n g u s
Comic books: 2:43
Where's 3000 days luke?
this shit is just an excuse to not post 3000 days
Btw luke u did no damage cuz u have to hit it's neck, not it's back
100 days aether?????
Who wants a 100 days of one block?
you can just use that chest to craft shulker box
Hi
in the start of the video
Hello do 200 days and beat the ender dragon again
3000 days
I needed this to survive
Nice
please tell me why did not get any chests.
when is 3000 day in hardcore mincraft
It's Coming Home
where did he get that torch tho
Can you do the next 100 days in the same world but in the overworld and just keep it as a normal playthrough
Bro that took a dark turn 1:50
How did he get the torch?
I read the title and my non functioning brain thought that he died in his original 100 days series. 🥲
plz luke take ur time to make your own mc skin it makes everything better
Wait how did he use the elytra if he had a curse of binding diamond chest plate?
I love the floor of your house
I thought of this a couple days ago which is funny that u ended up doing it!
WHAT A BLOODY LEGEND
Once i Was died in the end and i Was determined to dont go OV without shulker boxes and thats kinda what happend  (it take a lot to download end and dragon throw me off the world)
Luke:goes in creative to get a torch Everyone:*gasp*
Shulker box has left the server
can smn pls tell me how did he get that torch me so confused
There is a way of seeing the days in the end
Man, i was so sad when i realized the *END* of the video was close
24:00
Mabey you can do a 100 days in bedrock edition series
Hey luke can you plz do ark survival 100days ….. i love youre fids❤️
pog
3h
He's a madman for keeping music on for 100 days...
Cool video
These are all to put off releasing 3000 days. Just release 3000 already bro
2:40 *onomatopoeia ensues*
3:54 how the ladders
Luke, will you return to Halo once Infinite is out?
11:55
big pog
dude you can combine all items to repair them lol not just for elytrays
"It's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me."
how do u know what day it is?
It’d be cool to see a 100 days in each biome. Though figuring out how to beat the dragon by staying in a biome would be difficult.
200 days in the nether
Ummmmm where did he get the torch
This is the first time I've seen someone do a boss fight like a terraria boss fight.
I need 3000 days
3 HOURS AGO
ur so good
the way he says "a mong us" just sounds partially strange
Do 100 days underground and 100 days skyblock
<——— LOOK AT THAT DOGGO 🐶😍
spend hours on a bridge but all it takes is one ender pearl to get to the beginning island
I’ll assume the torch was from the central end island’s portal?
Terraria 100 days
Hate your floor
come ooooon, do more nether!!
Yaaaa
Day 11 I got a block
This is actually really quick how he got enchanted diamond gear
Only luke is the only one that can make 100 days that not boring you will laugh and excite watching him not like other 100 days with mods
Yup, They're doing it right no; Quoting me. In the comments section. On my own video." -Luke, 03/07/21
Yes, My inventory is already sus. AMOGOS -Luke TheNotable
" *Normal 100 days* " : Goes to the end on day 100 and almost dies 5 times  " *LukeTheNotable 100 days* " : Starts in the end and almost dies 169 times
I really thought that you will mine in the middle of the pillars so you can break the crystals
no but fr wer did  torsh come nform
Ok, but why does the monument look like golden wind from jojo's?
No one: My frind:how you playing mine craft for 3 hour? My: look for this guy.  This guy playing minecraft 700+hour
Yay
If you don't know what day it is you can press F3 and it says somewhere there
Also, rip enderman
Can you do 200 days BUT you give urself a sapling and dirt, and two water buckets?
22:35 how did he didn't teleport while eating chorus fruit
He could of went to the nether to get wood and make the diamonds usefull
Wheres 200 days with tors
Welp since we had the océan update the nether update the cave and Cliff update and the village update i look forward for the end update because i see a tone of potential in the end
Early
How you do that you pro
This was worth the wait- I'll probably try this! :D You're doing a great job!
There's 1 of 100+ views that'll come from me
Imagine if you were playing things like this naked and afraid style, where you can bring like one or two items with you to make it less impossible
Seriously how DID he get the torch?
Past title: survived a 100 days in the nether New title: survived a 100 days in the end Future title: survived a 100 days in the aether dimension
Nice video I enjoyed it! I thought this would be walking around in a circle for 100 mc days lol I didn’t think abt the end cities
Haha yes
“Most of you are just unoriginal and just quote me” -LTN THAT’S NOT TRUE… actually wait a minute-
You should’ve made an anvil with all the iron to add ur loot together
"there doing it right now. quoting me, in my own comment section"
Man stepping into the overworld after days must be quite the feeling
Yeah, I would have grabbed like...FEW dirt, and a few saplings, before making off to the end. it's true though, here's hoping the end gets some Love.
Couldn’t he of just went through the portal to get to the ender dragon  island
istg there's no way he didnt miss all those end chests on purpose
Bro, I fricking love your videos . There so entertaining!😄👍
Stop stalling
If you just had beaten the dragon on day 80 you would have had wood
Congrats on being number three on trending!
why would someone do that i think he needs help hmmmm… make a 5million days video if you need help •-•
Huh were did the 🔦 come from. (Torch)
The original guy who did the good videos lol

"Overworld normies", best quote
I love the outro
When is the one block series coming back?
Luke you inspired so many people to do 100days
11:56 i felt that among us in my soul. seriously.

Minecraft but I can collect wood.
"Violence is the answer." Youtube wants to know your location.
“Most of you are pretty un original and just quote me”-Luke da babable

Diamond are so useless lol
Bruh imagine 100 Days in the deep dark, it’d be the most scariest 100 days ever!  Edit: that was awesome! Keep up the good work! How about 100 days in a ocean only world?
he made ladders in the End
You should Get a skin

This man is a father, and is making 30 hour Minecraft videos, respect to you Luke.
Who else laughed when he said crack head? XD
No wonder why this is number 3 on gaming
"There quoting me in my own video"
lets go boys
I thought u were going to end the hardcore series😂😂😂
Oooooooh #3 trending on YouTube!
The King is back
200 days- time to conquer the other dimensions
when they say the next 30 mins they mean 30 mins STRIGHT
he coude of made a iron door
Don’t worry, I won’t quote you.
Friend: What is your favorite game? Me: 11:55
why didnt he just use the portal to get back to the end island (the bedrock floating ones)
best youtuber ever
I’m building a stairway! Not to heaven, that doesn’t exist. 😳😳😳
12:08 Ender balls xD
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Did anyone else notice the serious lack of 69 jokes on day 69
LUKE PLEASE DO 100 DROPS BEDWARS
Such a notable challenge
will u ever do it for bedrock
Jesus loves you. He died on a cross to prove it. Repent to him today!
You should give yourself 1 workbench. That spicy up gameplay
More please
Lleeesss gggoooo
I get triggered everytime he flies or used a ender pearl
You literally could’ve just used the obsidian to build a nether portal and get wood from the nether.
Yes it is
“Most of you are unoriginal and just quote me” - LTN
Me through the entire video: UsE sHuLkEr BoXeS
When I read the title I thought he was ending his 2000 day wrld
Nice Great Luke stay notable
Normies: MaKe ThReE ThOuSaNd DaYs Normal people: this guy is good
Funny how he never made any shulker boxes
Hi
Quick question, are you 32 or 23
Your channel is amazing  I thought you could do cave 100 days  You could dig under ground to go to other caves since some caves go underground so you could get trees and would safely
I kinda feel bad Luke's popular stuff is 100 day minecraft stuff. I hope he likes doing it.
Why people keep disliking
Lmao quake pro is the only I can play
How did he got a torch🤔🤔
DIRTY ATHIEST
11:00 My respect for luke went down
4:31 ABSOLUTLY HALARIOUS
I am still waiting for a 200 days with Tors.
Yeeeees
11:55   A MONG US 💀
I LOVE THE BUILD YOUR BETTER THAN ME I ALSO LIKE THE DISIGHN <3
I play on quake pro normally
somehow went from average player to a god in the span on 11 days
How luke thenotable making nice house in end how
YES! awesome!
basically  Days 1-25: Getting started Days 25-50: Mine stone, loot city, repeat Days 50-75: The road and finding the dragon island Days 75-95: House redecoration Days 95-100: Killin' the dragon  i  am surprised that you were able to do so many things in the end and build an actually good looking house, keep up the good work
Luke you deliver all the time,thanks man
it is possible top kill the dragon if you get pearls and destroy the crystals then treat that dragon like the first tree you see
Luke living in the end for 100 days has better gear than me who has been playing for 3 years.     I like to farm
i literally just thinking about ,  imagine forget ur elitra and die of fall dmg , and then  just when i think about it day 27 comes in
Pog
30 minute video... 30 minute lunch
Yeah you gotta get head-shots on the dragon with Melee. I'm very bad with aiming and bows so I always use a sword.
I think you sould make an uncut version of this
Apathy is lack in care
Cool
I like the sus reference
"Mom can we get."life less do do do do do do do do" at home ? "No we have life less do do do do do do do do at home Life less do do do do do do do do do do at home: Baby shark do do do do do do do do do.
This just shows they should add biomes and trees in the end update like in nether update. And add ruby back in the game and make it exclusive to end. And in the end you can use ruby to trade with idk what creature.
I never knew he had a kid
17:04 why you swear
Seriously where did you get the torch from
Great video, but I dont blame you for not wanting to do a 200 days on it. I can only imagine how mind numbing it was to do this
you did Adolf Hi**er 26:55        sorry
Ima do this but have 1 tree to start cuz I can't play with out a crafting table
Do the aether dimension (I know it is a mod/add on)
I like Luke he is cool
You can make shulker boxes using the 2x2 crafting grid in your inventory. Shulker boxes are able to be crafted shapelessly in 1.17, meaning that if you put two shulker shells on opposite corners of the crafting grid and the chest in the top left, you can make shulker boxes.
Noo.. pls don’t say that  … 3:39
A billion diamonds in this world: useless Corrus fruit: you can't live without me
y tf do i get nervous watching luke even bridge in the end i sweat
How is he getting achievements in creative
I was yelling abt him having shulkers until i realised he can't craft
Just me who thought he was gonna finish the Og series?
Chorus fruit farm = very pretty
If anybody has trouble falling asleep,just watch this video before going tho hed
He should make shucker boxes he has chests to
Pls do a three thousand days
LTN: “Yeah you see it? They’re doing it right now. Quoting me. On my own video”
But how did he get that torch though?
You could have used the ender dragon to get fire and lit a nether portal and then get wood
I dropped 100 days on bedrock Minecraft
You should do 100 bedwars games
Video idea: 100 drops into call of duty war zone verdansk
I’m dumb. I thought the title meant the end of the 100 days Minecraft series. 😂😭
You can't wood in the end soo how did he get ladders 4:16
omg new upload
Kinda early
3000 days
you could go to the nether if you can
Flat world 200 days? No? Nether 200 days? No? Regular 3000 days of hardcore? No?   Ah yes, 100 days in the end, literally no one asked but its free content after all  But it does get irritating when the flat world, nether and this one are just going to be one offs and I came for the ultra long infamous regular hardcore, not the 100 days one offs like every other YouTuber sending out more 100 days content that is already oversaturated
"thats why i always fly with my ender balls out"-Luke TheNotable
100 days in the nether
under bedrock
Imagine being so Notale that in the 100 days you get better gear in the nether and end than in overworld
Btw, you could’ve gone to the Nether from the end and got some wood to craft
Babe wake up there’s a new ltn upload
Hi
Go to the real wold with the obsidian
He’s really milking this isn’t he
I can send the video to Twitter
The end
"It's not like you can unwatch this video" Bet *Starts to unwind it*
Your desendents will be enderman as enderman were human before they got trapped in the end
e
Ender balls =)
“THEY ARE CURRENTLY QUOTING ME IN THE COMMENTS.” -Luke TheNotable 2021
This video is cool but stop the your mom jokes
Forgot about this dude
"Do you see it? Yep. There doing it right now. Quoting me." Luke TheNotable
Questions Luke the notable why are most of your 100 days 30 minutes and 1 second. It could be just 30 minutes but you put 1 second more and for some reason it bothers me.
game plan:  kill many endermen,  throw eyes at crystals, wait for drag to perch punch that mf use end eyes to travel through the end island, get elytra and other goodies, 100 days in the end!
great now give us 200 days with tors please XD
25:29 - 25:31 ”Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me.”       This was a notable event/occurrence that took place on the 78th day, and the video itself was uploaded to YouTube on July third 7pm (Swedish time) in the year 2021 back when the Gregorian calendar (Also known as the new calendar, which it self was a reformed version of the Julian Calendar, that itself dates back to the days of the Roman Empire.) was still in use widely through out the world…   Very notable, wouldn’t you agree?   Ps love that stuff at 30:02 it’s u know….
2 words  Haha RIP
😎
Next on LukeTheNotable's channel - 100 Days Minecraft Nether Roof / Minecraft Void
What’s the seed you used? Your end was super cool
16:35 me watching this in a McDonald’s uniform
where did you get the torch
this was just 100 days of depression
i could never
LTN stands for Little Turd Nugget
Do it again and conquer the other two realms
Why didn’t u go for the elytra on day 6?
Um, how did he get the torches???
Really Luke 30 minutes and 1 second together be an extra one
11:55 i just cant anymore, amoung us has destroyed my life, i thought that was funny, i just cant take it anymore i cant
their children would be horribly disabled by all the inbreed     yes
U should do 100 day one block skyblock
When Luke's kids grow up and watch this it is going to be interesting for them
why did that monument look like Adolf Hitler
Great video!
Wait, how did you count the days and nights Luke TheNotable?
How do ypu know how many days have passed on the game? Sorry my ignorance
Nice dude
100 days in the infinite dimension
100 days rlcraft
100 days in Minecraft bedrock hardcore :)
yo where does chests come from
11:02 I'm building a stairway, not to heaven because that doesn't exist  Sad Jimmy Page guitar chords
luke, you can make shulker boxes for more storage and put the dragon head on that enderman can see you
you have to hit the head of the dragon
I tried 10 days on super flat cuz of u and it’s not bad it’s just taking a long time but thx for the idea I’m making a vid about it
“Do ya see it? Yep, they’re doing right now, quotin’ me, in my own video” -Luke The Notable, 2021
why did you not break the end city chests for a shulker box
Try making a 100 day of in bedrock edition
The notable Luke amogus earrape
11:53 my inventory is already lookin kinda sus!
luke if you press f3 and look next to what biome it says ur in u can see the days u survived
God damn it, Luke. The house! It's... It's -beautiful- *Notable.*
heck yeah
AMOGUS
What about shulkerbox
for anyone wondering how he got the torch, it is on the main island. (specifically, the bedrock structure)
Wow,you made a house which is better than my overworld house XD
It would be super interesting to see Luke in a new normal hardcore world in 1.17 and see the difference and similarities to is current one from the 2000 days. I mean, he now kinda learned how to build pretty stuff  and everything
This dude literally just made history
11:51 Suspicious
He should do this again but with the end modpack that bring trees and other things to the end
Aight im trying this
He said that we could try the challenge and I did (pc btw) I didn't record it bc my voice is disgusting and my mic is kinda bad but all I wanna say is I beat the ender dragon at day 43 but I totally forgot about the end city loot so I'm glad I watched your video
Do 100 days in 1 block
Sheesh
Luke the notable- “ I did some off camera mining and now I have 10000000000000000000 end stone
Where’s 3,000 days minecraft hardcore? I can’t wait for it if you ever do!
Do 3000 days
idk if its posible but you could kill endermen and throw your ender pears to the towers
When he doesnt know that if he just pearl into the bedrock portal thing he'll get teleported back into the regulaur end
1.19 or 1.20 could be the end update like new ores in the end and a mini boss like the king dragon with purple fire breath and end in 4 seconds
Suggestion: Spend 100 days hardcore in a few dimensions from the 2020 April Fools update.
Can you make a 100 DAYS only stone tools?
OHHH YEEEES BABY LETS FRIPING GOO BABYYYYYYYY YES
I mined up the obsidian me big brain go to nether and back to overworld
Ender man killing gazebo 😂 lol
Luke the Notable? More like Luke the Quotable lmao
Luke: “They’re doing it right now! Quoting me! In my own comment section!”
11:01 people will get mad at you for this ngl
Damming hope 3000 days is happening
It's crazy how you can survive literally anywhere in Minecraft
You should do 100 days in ravine
do oneblock minecraft once luke
Easier said than done
shulker boxes
at 17:36 um... the noise
I thought you said screw the elitra
100 days in a void world
Little minecraft tip: Ender Peals don't fall faster than the player so if you are tossed into the air and falling back down throwing a pearl to the ground won't save you most of the time.
Okay how does he get the iron bars and trapdoors and the torch im dumb
More the half the way through  Day 42
The end used to be normal, now it's notable.
100 days in a cave only world
When his hearts are hardcore but he still respawns
Do you like my home
100 days on mcpe?
It was a good experience to watch and thanks Luke thenotable for the idea
100 days in rl craft please
Bro why did you go in c mode to get a touch man
When you have more elytra than wood
Man has 3.89M+1 subscribers * 😉 amazing
hey luke i know you wont see this but can you do 100 day underground in a cave
Can we consider his stress of not taking the end chest, but could of made shulker boxes? 😂
I did not know u had a daughter
I was watching this on my big screen and whenever you said “the end” my brother screamed at the top of his Lungs thinking that it was the end of your series
14:25 you can literally make shulker boxes
I like how he didn’t get an end chest in the beginning but when he built his bunker near the dragon he didn’t mention he finally got one
How did you get the touch
The photo on the vid: luke: oh net ugly enderman xD
LTN: End rods are my first placable block  Chorus flower: Sad end noises
That is the first and last time I will hear diamonds are worthless
Guess you could slowly accumulate enough iron to make an anvil? Max out your emchatments easier. Not that there's anything to use them on.
This video was not that good
14:18 perfectly timed cave sound
When he sad that he is making 100 day the end i thout he meant the end of the 100/1000 day series
When till 3000 days???
3000 days hardcore???
LTM:"Its not like you can unwatch the video". Me: "Are you challenging me?!"
13:26 You coulda taken those pants
Ehen you gunna make 200 days for creative
Why didn’t you make shulkers?

"yep, they're doing it right now, quoting me, in the comment section, In my own video"- Luke
You need to play fortnight
11:02 That’s where you’re wrong
Pro tip to keep track of your days, in the F3 menu it shows what day you're on.
I MISSED IT BECAUSE OF SLEEP? SLEEP? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!?
This video shows luke getting closer to insanity
“Apathy's a tragedy and boredom is a crime…”
*sad shulkerbox noises*
I do them and its hard and fun and i do them with friend
Banger if a video
HELLO SIR
Oh my God. He actually did it.

are ya winnin son?
Eer
If you do 200 days you could upgrade your roof by doing 3 blocks high but use slabs👍
Lol
How did you accomplish the impossible?
No lie, I am actually curious about the torch.
“But most of you guys’ comments are super unoriginal and just quote me. Look. They’re doin’ it now. QUOTE ME!” -Luke the notable - 2021
Please I’m begging GET A SKIN
14:56 Actually Ibxtoycat already did this middle of last year.
so this is what it's like being an enderman
LTN i'd kill a baby villager for a shulker box. Also LTN: throws out shulker shells
Your house could be better
Hey, can you do a challange to play 100 days playing normal minecraft but you cant break any wood. I dont know is it is possible or maybe is too hard or to easy but if it is a good challenge can you please do it. (If there are some spelling mistakes thats because i am from the netherlands)
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE you understand luke thenotable sed it
"100 days in the end" Mat pat: "hey, I've seen this before"
Skyblock 2.0

Wow. Just wow.
This video doesn't exist. (Sarcasm seeing as people can never tell.)
Also if you do 100 days in jurassic Park there are multiple so choose one you like
Hi 👋
100 day in bedrock addition

12:57: Actually I did it on my own (wasn't recording it was just a random thing I decided  to do) and got bored of it in 15 minutes so you aren't the first to try it but you are definitely the first to see it through. EDIT: luke the notable has unlimited patience
Why didnt you credit calvin

Luke if u put a ender head on your main hand (that's in use) and on your off hand it looks like mittens
"I still love reading comments"

Luke:im bulding a staircase not to heaven that fosrnt exist. Me:becomes athiest
hey LTN tip, you didnt have to use the looting 3 iron sword, just have the sword in your off hand and the looting still works, even with a bow and potions, hope this helps in future :)
NOTABLE
Bro said, Day 53 NFT BABY
So how did you get the torch
Now all we need is 100 days in one block skyblock
100 days in spectator Mode?
Please please do 100 days in the Aether Reborn? The aether myth and mod is a big part of any veteran minecrafter’s start of Minecraft
He has done it again
Bruh. You can make shulker boxes with a chest in the middle and a shulker shell  on the top and bottom of it
Quake pro is the only way I can play Minecraft
No I aight insane I’m notable  -Luke July 3rd 2021
"No mods you just need mine craft" Me on bedrock: Sigh
3000 days?
Like kinda sus ngl
“Nah…. I’m not insane…. I’m notable.” If that line isn’t friggin noted—
I love how Luke has started one of the biggest trends on YouTube.
“It’s a chorus fruit farm!!” I thought it was a lunchroom
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Whats wrong with me.... i thought the statue was... it is hitler.. sorry
Yeetly Deets you used Cheats   I actually don’t care. You’re video is still awesome anyway! 🙂
where is spire 100 drops and spire assassin one day
why wasnt the "whats up mc fans!" intro😭
missed the op to call this 1 day in the end :(
100 days in skyblock please
God bridging
Prot 4 iron is as good as prot 3 diamond
You should do 100 day with my daughter
i cant tell if youre serious when you said you were selling footage of you mining/placing slabs as an nft because youtubers have been destroying the environment with a lot of stupid things recently
Alternate title Luke making weird holes with hand and endstone
At 7:36
day ur mom lol
Make shulker box
noice
First
100 Days skyblock
i love how the video is EXACTLY 30 minutes long
why did he not make shulker boxes?
Hey there I have kinda lost contact with your Chanel land I was wondering what happened to 2000 hardcore Minecraft because there isn’t any other video aside from one where you show us your base
Why didn’t you make shucker boxes
69
Gay
Why didn’t he just craft a shulker box
me wating for 3000 days :/
do surviving 100 days in real life
Fortnite 100 drops pls
Leads goooo
Could u do a 100 day hardcore world again pls
The portal is open and u can go to overworld so u might as well make 200 days
You can make an end house look good with like 3 blocks at your fingertips and then I'm over here who can't make a house look good with the entirety of minecraft at my availability. How do you do this?
Thanks for posting today thank you for making my day have a great day and night
I use chorus fruit as my main food source
Luke The Notable, are you trying to trade mark the term "100 Days"? If you are, what the actual f*ck is wrong with you
I love the design of the first cours root farm(sorry about the spelling)
This was pretty boring sctually
unmodded. what the actual [REDACTED]
YES!
Ay yo I thought this was the end of the 100 days series 🤣🤣
Why didn’t you kill shulkers and mined chests to make shulker boxes
Should’ve used mods this one is boring as hell for 29 or 30 days
When u realize he didnt use shulker boxes
House: exists  Luke TheNotable: WE NEED TO BUILD A WALL
This was more interesting then I expected.
MAKE A SHULKER BOX
100 hardcore day in skyblock?
I tried doing this and I died so many times
Making a wall for stopping endermen?
Damn I’m late
dude u cheated! u died on day five
The title of this should be what day will Luke think of grabbing an end chest
the return of the king
3000 daysssssss
“They’re doing it right now, quoting me in the comment section of my own video” -LTN
Nice
Yes the sir
My prediction to what hes gonna do next: 100 days bedrock edition
the end is the opposite of the verse of mr blue sky: "hey there mr blue were so glad to be with you"
I couldn’t watch the stream because I was sick
i liked luke but now i hate him because of this video
Actually you can leave the end Island in creative mode I did it before because when I summon the ender dragon not on the island it went towards a black spot and I followed it and I found that same island so you don't even need to defeat it all you needed was blocks and you would have found it but it is hard
Where the nether did he get the torch from?
i enjoyed the video but it made me realize how much boring minecraft is, again.
I feel like a crack head -luke the notable
love it
theres how to do it easy end the world
I tried the same in the nether, and ashow in the end
you couldn't hit the dragon sometimes because you can only hit his head
Luke amazing video and I could never do it, but unless something has changed you know you can craft shulker boxes with a chest and two shulker shells. No baby villagers massacred in the process. Take that as a positive or negative.
This is why we need an end update
Im just wating for 3000 days
*we dont speak about the torch*
Gg man
Hit the dragon on the neeccckkk plssss
Do a video with tors
anyone else wishing for more fortnite content don’t like if you agree
LIAR! ITS 30:01 NOT 30 MIN
Where is left to do 100 days on?
Video Idea: 100 days to get all achievements
Spending 100 days in skyblock seems like the only possible answer he is out of demensions
11:55
“A M O N G U S” -Luke
I love it!
This inspired me to build an end base on my hardcore world
Luke uploading by now is a national holiday
The fabulous sweatshop atypically consist because worm interspecifically fasten of a deeply firewall. cheerful, mixed girdle
Got here before 1 Mil I feel accomplished
Remove 10 of the dislikes in what do you get (4-20)
Is it just me or is the soundtrack for the end dimension one of the best in the game?
how did he get that torch tho :0
11:55
69 days Nice!!!!
A notable run. nice
Watch this man play 100 days under water next
So many days of complaining about storage and I'm over here wondering why not just make shulker boxes. Oh. No crafting tables because no wood.  I'm dumb.
bruh you could have craftet shulkers
That one hand:
"Don't quote me" Luke_TheNotable 2021
Luke u prob won't see this comment but make 100 days of skyblock or one block
You can clutch with the fruit
Yum
At least there are no creepers this time
I like the house
Genuine question: if you were to die in this series, or any other 100 day series, would you restart or no?
100 days in the OCEAN
luke: you guys are quoting me in the comments right now
You're floor is eh ok
ok no honestly how did he get the torch??
Usless stuff to normal players: dirt usless stuff the luke the notable: diamonds
Chorus root farm? They’re called chorus fruit
Nom
I love his self-aware trademark jokes 😂
You  have a baby
get this boi to 4M sub it up
I spent half this video visibly upset because I was so sure you could craft Shulker Boxes without a crafting table but it turns out I was just an absolute fool
I love it
He ate a chorus fruit on day 69 and didn't teleport
Imagine only having 3 mobs and no wood. Posted by over world gang
No oh wait no I was going to say I use the diamonds on a diamond pickaxe Diamond stubble and Diamond full diamond armor but already have diamond armor diamond shoes
Notably insane
Yay new 100 days *still waiting for 3k :D :
EARLYYYYYYYY YO
Like how he those this with out mods it's just better normally people can't take the difficulty and play with mods
I feel like ender dragon is easyer than ligit wither fight
You’re certainly notable
Next video: spending 100 days underground
Lets test it, give it all the likes and see if he won't do another!!
"Quoting me in my own video" 🙄
Nice
Yessssssssss i have been waiting for this!!!
You sound like jerry from Rick and morty
I love it when he’s like        A M O N G U S
MOOOREEE!
How did he get ladders and torches
First to say pop tart yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet  Notes me
3:41 “try to remind yourself this game is for children” the difference is that as a child you don’t usually have the mental capacity to experience the game entirely as it should be
Haven’t watched yet, but I can already tell this will be interesting
He died in his main world thats why he is doing all of these little weird playthroughs to bide time to figure out what to do. At least thats what I think
Spend 100 days in Minecraft Bedrock
The prophecy is true
to some, saying that diamonds are useless is an insult, but to the people who can't make a crafting table,    they're right.
To be 100% with you Luke if you see this I personally didn't enjoy this challenge because I recently watched cxlvxn 100 days in the end and he used a mod that made the end 100 day challenge more enjoyable because he was able to get tools and better food, but I love your content keep on doing challenges like this    (3000 days)
i like the floor tho gonna steal the design
3000 day pretty please!!!!!!
This has to be the most depressing 100 days
"yup, your doing it right now, quoting me, in my own video"  -lukethenotable
Wait you just figured out you can combine stuff to fix it or is it just a joke oh btw i wont believe you if you said its not a joke
Any1 waiting dfor 3 thousand days :)
i know it wont make a dent but if you don't upload the 4000 days hardcore i will unsub and dislike every video
100 Days - [Minecraft Berock Edition] anyone?
Subah link and came out of the net will be.     Give me a copy of world YouTube
"I hope you enjoyed watching. And if you didn't... well... it's not like you can un-watch this video, but I thank you either way" -LukeTheNotable
Ok he completed The overworld, the nether and the end. Now im waiting for the eather.
I know where did the torch came from, but where did you get the trapdoors? You can't craft them, and well , I don't think end cities have iron trap doors , do day? I'm curious
THAT THUMBNAIL
No luke.  It’s 30:01 mins not 30 mins
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"day ur mom" idk why but i laught a lot
When is 200 days with the tors?
You really had to drag this video didn’t you?
Okay, the fact he could have made shulker boxes and didn't will keep me up at night.
he’s back
wheres 4000 days?
among us
How does he know when its day or night?
I did a survive in the nether challenge once. I still only have gold, wooden, and stone tools. I don't even have a portal back.
You fools, that quoted him You fell into his trap
amogus
Alternate title: raiding end city’s without shulker boxes
*ãmõñgūš*
Next Video "I spent 100 days on skyblock"
At the end of 3000 days hes gonna be NukeTheLotable
(ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง
Yay a new vid
Please do 3000 days
Balls??!!?!
Why didn’t you use the chests in the end cities, and your shulker shells to make shulker boxes? Edit: I’m a huge fan, I don’t want this to come off the wrong way :)
You could try surviving 100 days in the forest
E
I don’t know why, but whenever I looked at the chorus fruit, it looks like there is a white rat with its head sticking out
Hey Luke just a piece of advice Or a piece of fact that if you do a videos like that and you don’t know when is the next day like is it day one or day 2 then I The answer put a timer for 20 mins and after that it’s the next day in Minecraft   Also when are you landing in Netflix or is it a show before fame?❤️ love your videos it’s like a movie or an episode of a show a very famous show and everyone would be STUPID NOT to watch it ❤️
Sorry if I sound stupid but how did he get that torch?
"See there doin it right now, quoting me in the comments section on my own video"- Luke the notable
25:41 one of the choruses is  s u s
When will 3000 days in hardcore mc be? Or are you gonna go straigth to 5000
I’m starting to think he died while filming 3000 days
Hmmm, I wanted to say make an anvil and mix your tools , but now I realized there's no crafting table
Mojang should put a sapling and dirt as rare does in chests for lunatics like LTN
Can't you do more fortnite😇😇😇☺☺☺
When I am alone, and feel depressed, I come and watch LTN. He's so notable...
when 3000 days
The cooing note antenatally analyse because game enthrallingly push across a amuck invention. unknown, deeply water
I don't like the floor, remember not to read this
LTN should do 2100 days in hardcore just to annoy everyone that he didn't make 3000 days.
Make a 3000 DAYS VİDEO
“Quote me in the comment section” LMAO SO RELATABLE
Just tried saying your name and instead said “Nuke the Lotable”
"my inventory is already looking kinda sus 𝗮𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘂𝘀" that got me 😂😂
Luke: There's no day cycle in the end! Me: Why isn't this one day in the end then
Mhm quite notable
Incredible
Thanks Luke, I liked this video. It was very notable. Certainly a very uninteresting challenge, but you made it fun to watch nevertheless!
He got a torch from the portal back while killing the ender dragon
Why he de not made a shulker box
Who started this trend
Don’t ever say that you are more creative than people it’s mean and rude 😠
Ltn I cant watch this video the network is terrible
Luke: oh look what is this                                             Me: Its your mom
Luke what happened to hardcore minecraft did you die?
I’m starting to think I’m doing a favor by killing the endermen in the end
3000 or4000 days hardcore minecraft
"But now I have wall, and a wall is peace of mind" yes
More notable content
can't wait for 3000 days!!!
when he did the sounds for the elytra it sounded like Stampy
Please tell me that you are still doing the main series
I like the part were it said day urmum
Hey can you let us know if you have started day 2001 yet
I thought it was the end of the 100 days series
Day 36: I am depressed. give me ender pearls.
LTN builds better in the end with limited items than I do in creative ; - ;
I hope you eventually use the shulkers lol
Why did you change your intro it was perfectly fine!!!
so no aether nor twilight 100 days kidna sad
Man actually did it
100 days hypixel skyblock
Luke u should pin me because I never quoted u
Im watching this while working out
100 days on a skyblock map
Love ur videos I’ve been watching for awhile
do the superflat 100 days without structures. This is about the hardest you can get. (i mean you can make the whole world out of bedrock blocks, but i am pretty sure that one is impossible to progress in. Though the regular superflat without structures is possible on hardcore. You just kill mobs with hands and wait for pillager patrol, to kill vindicators, get emeralds and buy a sapling from a wandering trader. And it is possible on hardcore. Luke The Notable, i challenge you to do this on hardcore. Prove that you are as notable as a human being can get
Really milking this lol
You should do 100 days in hypixel Skyblock
Tip: dont have any pickaxe there and have encountered so many end city well them take over that end city and make it your own mwahahahahahahaha
punch dragon to death then pearl into the  portal
On day 66 Luke executivesd order 66
Why don’t u continue your original hardcore world?
Hi
Love the video but would rather se 3000
Fun fact!: Luke’s daughter was born on my 14th birthday
Can someone explain y he can't make a shulker box?
Luke is just punishing himself for our entertainment
amogus
11:54
"into the void!" That had me laughing :)
I can’t even survive in the over world so I can’t imagine surviving in the end
👍
Why build a road to the dragon when you could just teleport into a gateway
I just now realized that he can't craft.
I’ve been waiting for this
26:55 i legit thought u made a hitler pixel art
No way I'm trying this. I already die way too easy with full netherite in the nether with my survival world. I starve, endermen kill me, or I fall into the void. Or experience kinetic energy.
3000 days
LTN: “don’t get me wrong I love reading comments, but most of you are unoriginal and just quote me”
Where is the tors 200 days
Why no one talking about why Luke didn’t go through the random portals that spawned? 😂
Luke thenotable I like your design your end house I would never think of that it was a pretty good design
These are lame
This man could probably live for 100 days in the nether at this rate.    *Now wait a minute*
STOP STALLING AND POST 3,000 DAYSS
100 hardcore days in ocean no mod 100 hardcore days in caves no mod 100 hardcore days with mother of dragons(ice and fire mod) Are these ideas notable enough?!
It’s actually 30 minutes and 1 second
Something something enderman pun
I remember when I got stuck in the end and couldn't find a way back so I just built a thousand blocks back to the ender dragon island fun times
Finally!!
also if you are in hardcore and it has a curse of vanishing then it doesnt matter because it dissapears when you die bro
This is all the evidence we need to convince Mojang to update the End
Hey Luke! I use your Creater Code in the fortnite item shop
Before a million views
18:00 who are you gonna reproduce with?
This dragon fight was the saddest thing I've seen and I killed the dragon with Iron armor
Literally everybody: just do 3k days  Luke : nope well here you go Luke if it’s that its taking a while it’s ok
Liflesss void dooooooooooooooooooo
11.53 amog us
100 days minecraft earth map?
ayyyyyyyy
"I still love reading comments it's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me." -Luke TheNotable 2021 😂😂😂
I mean....     there isn't a reason that you couldn't have started with a 'spawn chest' that had a crafting table & 8 stone in it  (just to make it all the more painful to choose between short term & long term), and 1 sapling[or many just for variety] (well any sapling outside oak/darkoak, can't have apples being around) with a singular dirt block.  Honestly I would have to think about what makes a good world spawn and strip out what doesn't work persay.  Ummmmmmm   I got an interesting challange skyblock idea.
It feels so strange hearing that diamonds are useless
Stay Notable
I tried this a month ago and quit 3 min in
“It’s not like you can unwatch this video” *goes to watch history* Or can I?
Wait... how did he get the torches?
"Yup, they're doing it right now. Quoting me. In the comment section. On my own video." -Luke the notable 2021
"Yep, they're quoting me. Right now. In the comment section. Of my own video." -LTN, 07/03/21
Ive actually tried the end challenge and i made it to roughly day 44 before dying from the void cuz my elytra broke😭
hey can you please respond pwease
5:33 to 5:37 funny maybe true and disgusting but funny
Luke should do 100 days in subnautica
Iron helm +protec IV is stronger then le diomond helm
where did you get the touch?
How did he survive on day 27 pearls fall slower than you
there they are quoten me on my own video
He does know that he could have just thrown an enter portal through the enter gates to get back to the main island instead of bridging thousands of blocks
heres a concept: 100 Days-[MINECRAFT BEDROCK] its different, trust me
Why doesn’t he make shulker boxes
are u working on 3000 days and u get bored so u make different ones or what?
I love your floor!!!!!!!!
But how did u get the torch no joke I’m confused
Luke can find end cities faster than i can find a sheep
You should do a hundred days in the new Minecraft cave
luke: heaven doesn’t exist  16 year old religious girls: cries
Hi
next: I spent 100 days working on 100 days videos that work on 100 days videos
This has gone too far
25:23 got me
Yay
Ltn ur me and my lil brothers fav YouTuber!!
I’ve seriously been waiting a long time, anticipating it, and it is now finally here!
Dang you are the best at Minecraft if you can survive 100 days in the end without any mods congratulations to you man.
Luke you are a creative man
Bro. The trim. LTN*DRIP*
It’s 30:01 minutes, I’m unsubscribing…
Here's a idea for a future video (maybe) Luke, 100 days on a island. (There's a Minecraft seed you can use.)
LTN fans—WE WANT 3000 days!   LTN—haha end go burrr
Pog
Dear God why?????
What for an end update and he does 200 end
YES!!! AWESOME!!! But, where fortnite?
Ha nice
Everybody Loves Luke
11:55 "omongos."
Hey what day is it? Luke: ur mom
Finally 😆
13:38 diareah? 🥺🤣🤪
"My first place able block" (5 seconds earlier) (uses a chorus block to get into the city)
i was a endstone miner until i got a enstone to the knee
It’s things like this that make me want an End-update similar to 1.16
Well this is unexpected but welcome
Hello
.0.
When the only use of diamonds is for flexing
Nsfw artists after seeing the thumbnail *Rubbing hands*
I know you can combine everything in Minecraft
who else clickeed thinking he died
Ok but consider    100 days in the ather
The torch is from the end portl
I've been having a very shitty day. It's been rougher one than most, but the little gag at 26:43 was the first time I actually smiled and laughed today. Like first thing that made me happy, genuinely happy. And I don't know why.  *Sorry for making this sad or depressing. And I know he probably won't get to read this, but I just wanted to let him know (even if it's a small chance that he sees) that he made my day. Thanks for keeping my head up.
wth is with the face
R.I.P the *'What is up minecraft fans my name is Luke TheNotable'* intro
You have an Alex skin. Maybe your skin could be just your face printed on a Minecraft skin. Would be very notable
Only true gamers want luke to upload civ 5 deity video
Is anybody gong to tell him that he could have made a iron door and a iron button?🤨
25:30 "Most of them are pretty unoriginal and quote me"
Shulker box? No? Fine...
LTN please respond
18:05 the worst part is there is literally a number at the bottom indicating the amount of armor it gives lol
MAKE 200 DAYS AT  HARDCORE     NETHER
He cuss he said shit
HEY LUKE! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
But this isn’t the end as I assumed as I’m guessing this is gonna go on until 10,000 days or more (yes I’m talking about the original)
Good tricks to do while in the end!
oh fucking yeah
Where were the iron trap doors from?
Hi
Can you continue your play through on super flat?😅😁😁
Best video

I finally got what i wanted.
İ would like to see this but with at least one oak plant, if a youtuber is reading this, do it, i will watch it.(also one dirt, it would be useless without dirt.)
just saying, not trying ot be rude, but gold is USEFUL just letting ya' know.  as i said, not trying to be rude, but there you go.

“I’m building a stairway. Not to heaven, that doesn’t exist.” -Lukethenotable 2021  Edit: yes, i commented this before i finished the video :(
11:56 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I GET THE REFERENCES BLUE IS SUS
WE NEED 3000 DAYS HARDCORE
Starting this challenge with a stack of dirt two water buckets and a crafting table would have made so many more things possible. (Maybe a few anvils too)
Next video: 100 Days Minecraft Sky Block
I disliked because this isn't 3000 days
'
Honest question, where did he get the torch?
lol i guessed what he was building 27:51
no but were did u get the torch tho
Can he not make shulker boxes?
Try Ark: Survival Evolved, hard very hard but would be fun to see you do 100 days hardcore
hella early
One thing I’ve noticed is how significantly better at the game you’ve gotten
Soz Luke no thanks{
I’m subscribed I’m subscribed
Not gonna quote you Not gonna quote you Not gonna quote you     “If you don’t like it, make sure to comment down below so I can make sure not to read it”
comment section unoriginal, smh.
GET LUKE TO 4M SUBS OR HE WILL BE IN YOU HOUSE EATING THE COOKIES DO IT NOW
Where is 3000days 😂 I am really excited about what things you will do in it .
1  200 days video later ( 5millon subs )
Can anyone explain  how lkn got iron trapdoors? I mean u can get iron but not a crafting table so what? Did he cheat?
When 100 days aether ?
if LTN dies in this world it's "The End" of that world and video. :D
30:01 omg uggggg
Havint eny one of you notist that evry 100 days vid its 30:01 minits long
The video is actually 30mins and 1second
100 days in bedrock???
26:44 lol
I can’t even survive easy difficulty without dying in lava and losing all of my items within the first 30 days…
3,000 days?
Is it me or does the monument seems familiar in a way ?
You can clutch whit corust frut
You should make your own skin
It would be cool if you did the next one like the first 33 days in the End, the next 33, in the Nether, and the Final 33 in the Overworld.... ALSO cool thing would be that to continue you would have to within those 33 days kill the Bosses of the Land, like End - Dragon, Nether - Wither, and Finally Overworld - Sea Guardian thingy medgig thing, just saying cool idea i had
life of an enderman  who kills his friends
why didn't use a shulker?
I've tried your nether survival and it's very hard
Dang it I didn't see the notification
"Yup they're doing it right now, quoting me, in the comment section" LTN -Oof PS: e
Next 100 days : 100 days minecraft but nether is in the end
OMG I love your house so much I saw this already but I just love your house it’s so good

M
M
Poggers

Is this still live :/
LTN when are you going to work on 3000 days?
Oh my gosh I love your house it’s so good
I love the fact that at the start of me watching Ltn I never understood his jokes 😏 but now I do
Like you should use lunar client it's an fps booster and it even has a day counter
Lol just live in an end castle or take its blocks instead of making one you of end dirt
He had to quarantine to get to get to each ender crystal lol
17:03 rare footage of Luke saying bad word and losing money
When is 3000 days coming out
I'm glad he uploaded today and I hope he didn't die in his 2000 hardcore series
How do you do this you are an amazing gamer
I keep having to remind myself that no, he isn't over looking something simple. He can't craft. He has way less than I think. Serious respect to Luke for being able to do this
Pog new post
This is what my doctor gives me when I am depressed
Pretty thiccc videos

you know... you can make shulker box,, right?
6:04 look at his hopbar ....a banner? A glitch block? What is that?!
Why diden you use end gedavej?
1 hiue ago, grewta
me: this is not 3000 days?       ltn: it never has been
But actually, where did he get the torch?
"Most of you are just quite unoriginal and quote me" - Luke TheNotable 2021
Nah that's not the longest fight with the dragon remember that fight where stampylonghead and iballisticsquid threw enderpearls at it until it died
Damn,Your house actually looked better than anything i built in the overworld...Not sure if i should be happy about that.
What an original idea.....
Very interesting to see someone last 100 days in the end. Well done.
Shulker boxes 1 chest 2 shulker shells.
11:55 sus!AMONG US!
I actually told this idea to a streamer a few months ago but be told me it would be boring so I didn't do it
3,000 days hardcore
what a notable video, I won't forget it until the next video.
hi
its 5 am and I'm steal deciding to watch and yes I'm supposed to be awake
25:25 done
Just realized something. Your monument... The head is empty. What does that say?
Now no more weird 100 days  *_WE WANT 3000 DAYS!!!_*
You should do ark survival evolved 100 days and so on for another 100 challenge.
Get to the nether  1. Collect obsidian from End Ships 2. Get to Dragon island 3. Build a nether portal frame right next to an end crystal 4. Break the crystal  5. Place a chest or ladder next inside the portal frame 6. The fire that spawns after breaking a crystal will light the portal  7. Get to the nether  8. Profit?
made 2 YEARS AGO jk
"Most if the comments are pretty unoriginal, they just quote me"
I LOVE it
Not even a single endermite pet?
Luke play 200 day's Minecraft with tors
I thought he was doing that mod but this man is a legend great video as always
He never told us where he got the torch tho
Me:sees this Also me:*clicks on fast as possible and has a random happy seizure*
his litterally broken after this vidz
hi
mrdinogaming11 this is my channel luke

could have made an iron door!!!
Luke is slowly getting a "hello fellow kids" vibes
I like your flooring
KMFAO
luke im pretty sure you dont teleport into the void if you eat a chorus fruit it wont teleport you where theres an air block
Plzz play fortnite
Now he’s going to try to do the Aether
Made it
We’re gonna have to wait for the 1.20 end update in 2023 for 200 days
You should do a modded version of the 100 days in the nether or end
In conclusion, end stone.
Hard-core 3000 days
Ended balls 🏀
Whys he keep saying “down here”
This makes him the second Youtuber to beat the dragon starting in the end unmodded
Yass
*Notable*
yo
I lost braincells screaming at him through the screen trying to tell him that he needs to make shulker boxes
Trademark list - 3000 days 200 days nether 200 days end
Missed the stream
Whenever you feel useless remember curse of vanishing exists in hardcore
Just realized he went the entire time with out a crafting table
He is so crative with challenges and all youtubers does 100 days hardcore this man needs more syns btw i want tors minecraft 200 days
Where is 3000 days hardcore
I can already tell that people are going to try to cancel luke when he said heaven doesnt exist
Hi
watching when in premiere
HAPPY 4MIL SUBS!
“I”    Luke 2021
YO LUKE. GO INTO WEBSITE CALLED SKINDEX AND SEACH LukeTheNoble I Made You A SKIN. HOPE YOU LIKE IT. I made you this cause your only Alex
WE ALL WANT YOU TO DO 3000 DAYS IN MINECRAFT HARDCORE PLZ!
When you get diamond armour and an elytra before you get wood....
Um ...  wow not black face in the first minute of a new video...
I don’t like it.
U passed a end city
Bro remember I was like the first person to watch dropping salty springs
HE CHEATED 1 TORCHS 2 THE F*CKING LADDERS
Best Minecraft commentary when it comes to this type of series tho. 😂😂☠️☠️
Amogus
Still stalling on the main series I see
Why would a man put them selves in such a charge😂😂😂🦒🥔🦒🥔🦒🥔🦒🥔🦒🥔🦒🥔🦒🥔🦒🥔🦒🥔🦒
I'm mainly focusing on how long this must have took him, you have great editing Luke!
now fight the wither
I love watching luke loot end cities for 30 minutes lmao
Luke is the best commentator, change my mind
Excuse me a new ltn video oh there goes my day
Luke In His 100 days Minecraft With Tors: If you get this video 200K  likes, we will make a 200 days. The video: Goes past 200K Likes. Luke: Doesnt make the video, even TODAY.
apathy: lack of interest enthusiasm or concern
Ever heard of shulker boxes lol
this was deathly boring
we want 3000 days
Use a neuter portal to get wood if it is part of the rules
you need shulker boxes
I'm sorry, but the monument looks like Hitler lol
Ngl ur armor is sus
It's luke,luke the notable
Not him making a weed farm 🤣
Lol 100 days or work for 30 mins of content
Very notable
Can I get free merch and a kiss
I love these man thank you for making my day again
Wait he has a daughter? Is tors the mum? Or is she just a friend
Is no one gonna talk about how he spawned next to a jungle
This is one of the many reasons of why Minecraft should have a second End update
You are the best survive like all together like 5000 days in Minecraft.
The End
3000 days soon?
E…….
I thought he was ending the 100 days series
hello luke
I see "DAY 85" in cornpr of my phone... Help ;-;   (ps. I see it on comment section)
Ideas: -100 days with a 100 x 100 border -100 days hypixel skyblock -100 days with mods -100 days with some datapack -100 drops hypixel skywars -100 drops hypixel bedwars
Let's just remember his love for enchantments that never existed lol - thorns 3
You could've made a iron door with a pressure plate....:)
Testing
how did he get ladder?
When you see luke mine on camera, entire minecraft community: we don't do that here
Everybody gangsta until he survives 100 days in the sky or underground
Only Luke TheNotable could make a video about a 100 days in the End.
Welcome aboard to our land friend, have a nice stay.
shulkerboxes pls
love your base for the ends limited matarials
29:00
Alternate Title:  Thirty Minutes of Mining Endstone
1:58
This was Great
No Body  Seriously Nobody  Luke: 100 DAYS IN THE END YES GREAT IDEA YES
not the first corus block is placeable
Luke thenotable I am righting to u today politely ask "PLS STOP STALLING 3000 DAYS" thanks for reading   Next time I won’t ask so politely   This u ➡️😎      🔫🗿⬅️ this me (social distanced of course)
He says debatable I say da baby
What about a 100 drops Bedwars?
I like the house
So he’s building a line of blocks to the enderdragon but he can just use the random portals in the end to go straight back to the enderdragon
Huh
Amongus
The end of luke
I tried the nether survival a d died within 10 seconds
lit
and now we need 1000 Days - [Minecraft End]
Where’s 3,000 days?
How much endstone do u want to mine ?  Ltn : yes
Do the challenge 100 NIGHTS in hardcore Every time the sun is raising, set it back to night
"Yeah you see it? Yep. They're doing it right now. Quoting me. In the comment section. On my own video." -LukeTheNotable
Alternate title: 100 Days - [Mining Endstone]
He set food on day 69 and did not teleport off ?????
Notable: today we will stay in the end with 50 ender mans following me for 2000 days
You didn’t do a I made it to their a hundred in one day for fortnite season 6?!
This man has a CHILD?!
Tores 200 days 🥺🥺 love the fact that luke died like 3 times Xd love vid
Violence is not the answer Luke. Violence is the question, and the answer is yes.
You need one item is flint thats it you can go to the nather
You should do 100 Days Skyblock. Any type.. I would prefer Hypixel though.
"I'm building a stairway not to heaven that doesn't exist here."  Words, of a true man.
25:30 “Yeah you see it, yep, you’re doing it right now, quoting me, in the comment section, on my own video” - LTN
are you still working on 3k?
I love your comments and all but most of them are unoriginal and just quote me. -Luke TheNotable 2021
HOLD UP
This is so notable!
@Luke TheNotable are u gay?
Luke: This is a 100 days in Minecraft   Everyone: Luke this is the six time in a row you’ve done this
Now this is Notable
Next video I survived 100 days under ground (Like so luke will see this)
sussy baka
Luke quick question I want to do this challenge but how do know when the day ends?
I think he should start his 3000 days world again
100 days in a minecraft desert
Les goo
Hey Luke if you see this what you do more Rainbow Six Siege
“Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me” -Luke Day 78
you,,, HATE quake pro??? i only play on quake pro. im just built different ig
You should do 100 drops bedwars
Has anyone noticed that the video is 30:01 minutes long? Soo close to 30:00 mins
The two failed trademarks bit made me scream
Idea I servie 150 days in Minecraft but every 50 days I go to a new demasis like go from nether  then overword then the end
plz do a series with tors like your 2000 days
8:31 Luke: gets 10 diamonds. Also Luke: "nothing too notable"
We want 3000 not 100 days end
Yep people are quoting me right now-Luke thenoatable
3000 days
Cxlvxn did a similar vid pls watch
You should do 20 Minecraft speedruns
Do 100 days in the largest Minecraft mod pack
Jesus loves you!
3000 days be like- Acha chalta hu duaon main yaad rakhna  (I am going, remember me in Prayers) Its a famous Indian song
Got Hmm
3000 DAYS NOOWWWWWW COWARD!!!
"Most people are unoriginal and just quote me" - Luke TheNoteable 2021
By my math this should have been 2200 days in hardcore but in the over world
A funny video idea would be a creative mode but you can’t place blocks you need to carve what’s your making
now. download the aether mod. do 100 days in the aether
This was actually more interesting than i thought it would have.
‘See, look. They are quoting me right now’ -Luke the notable 2021
Wheres 200 days creative?
Please do 200 NOW LUKETHENOTABLE NOW
"There quoting me right now in the comment section"                                                                                              -Luke The Notable                                                                                                   July, 3rd, 2021
Yooooo this will be easy and hard!
Ay wheres 3000 days???
“Lifeless boy doo doo doo lifeless boy doo doo doo” 😂😂😂
I like it
18:09 YOOO WTF
plz do a series with tors liken 2000 days
Make one days modded in different byams
@  betta rawn betta rawn fassta  dan my ballet
11:34 “My inventory is already looking pretty sus AMONGUS” 11:48 “Well thats why i always fly with my ender balls out”
Luke, please stay to your promise and not read these comments.
I lost 8 brain cells thinking of how ridiculous this would be
Soon he'll be doing 100 days in the twilight forest. That would be cool though.
I saw “the end” and thought “oh no he’s ending his main world”
Not tryna accuse Luke of anything but if you can't cheat in hardcore how could he have turned them on , to to the end and go back to regular hardcore? I'm a bedrock player so I don't know how this works , any Info would be good.
That was Bobby win gg..
I am just searching for the comment which helmet is better: Protection 4 Iron or no prot diamond
5000 days in hardcore?
100 days modded edition when?
Bet you want to go back with the slimes in super flat.
Luke didn't turn off his cheats after entering the end XD.
3000 days or how you died day 2001
I feel like an end update with hard to mine blocks, terrifying monsters, and bad food would be perfect for end gam players with stuff to do.
“Don’t look at the Endermen” Going to the End in 5 words.
This vid was 30 mins 1 sec what other lies have I been told
Very notable of you Luke
please do a series like the 2000 days but with tors plz
didid he not make shulker boxes
Went 3,000 day in minecraft  hardcover coming out
Luke will you ever get a skin?
WHERE ARE FORTNITE TIER 100’S!😠
How did you get a torch
When  you do a  3000 days
🤔🤔🤔Pop?!
“Java only, at least for now” -Luke TheNotable
I came here to pay respect to the father of 100 days
18:15 that went from 0 to 100 real fast
Most depressing 100 days I’ve watched
put "hardcore" in the title, NOW!
AMONG US
this video isn't good  He passed the 30 minutes
If you broke a staircase through the obsidian pillars, it would be possible to slowly punch the ender dragon to death.  It takes around 2 minutes to mine a single block of obsidians with your hand, which according to my rough estimate would end up taking 54 in-game days to take down the end crystals
Try the 'better end' mod. It's amazing
hello person who decided to turn comments to newest first, how you doing
lol
If this was possible what about 100 in the ocean
Bruh luke didn’t even think about making shulcker boxes
😳
Pog
I’m early
new title idea ;luke the notable starts to run out of ideas
Me thinking hes working on 3k days:  Him working on 100 days in the end: *get trolled*
Nice base
I loved this and you've inspired me to challenge myself in minecraft hardcore style like I attempted to beat minecraft while not being able to breath but I couldnt get past the nether not lucky enough
Hello!
18:07 - 18:18 I did not expect this.
When am I gonna se the 1# trending on this video cause it best be soon. Edit: There we go
“Hello Luke TheNotable here, and welcome to the end” *Ends video*
MAN STOP WITH THESE CHALLENGES WE WANT 3000DAYS
Why nobody talking about him copyrighting the word 100 Days?
bestie what about 100 days extremely modded to the point ur computer craves unalive
Help him👆🏿
Y didn't he make shulker boxes I'm in day 40 it's not hard what
How come on >>>>>>>>>> it shows 1 extra second but when I go here its 00 seconds where did my extra second go?
Best YouTuber ever been waiting for this video
This video is notable
*E N D        S T O N E*
I’m a genius. You could’ve (I’m about half through video) used the iron to make an anvil and make the perfect armour and gear.
is it just me or would it be good watching luke thenotable play ark survival evolved
Nobody: Luke: ...just some more useless dimonds...
"yep theyre doing it right now, quoting me, in the comments section, on my own video"  -LTN
Loved the video, congratulations for beating it too, Looking forward to the next one.
What was harder the nether or the end
Notable even in the end
Everyone: you can't survive in the end there's no wood! Luke: haha hardcore go *brrrrr*
You can use replay mod to make the fanciest shots! (Shaders help too) (And maybe some mods to make the sky look nicer)
What if he quoted himself
Can someone make this man a Minecraft skin  He needs one
NO IM LATE
Ooh! 30 minutes to waste my life away for good entertainment!
Man ur such a liar! U said the video was thirty minutes long but it’s actually thirty minutes and one second!       I’m jokin jees
Me: dO yOu kNoW mR. bEaST
Thing is I already did try it, hated it
heaven does exist
I demand a 3k day video but sofar i see youre only on 2001 days on mc hardcore..... sad.
100 days at bedrock
I think a challenging one for you would be a redstone challenge where all lighting, farming, etc had to be powered by some sort of redstone. Not sure how you would do it, but I think you trying make a mess of redstone wiring nice would be funny to watch.
Sus
Pls. 3000 days
When you try and copyright 100 days
End stone slab is an option for bridging ; - ;
I literally got hired by McDonald’s today luke
YES YES YES!
0:08 sure as hell will
You should try to survive 100 days in muck.
Noice
25:23 that got me soooo hard
what a champ
Do 100 days amplified world
How would you get the first children...
can u do 200 days with tors? please its all we want
Day 38 is my favorite
hi
This is the end
Sad fortnite noises
should have gotten a pet enderman
You should use slabs for your houses floor and roof so that it would still be 3 blocks tall and enderman can’t spawn in it
"ya see, their doing it right now. quoting me. in my own comment section"-LTN
Big blu thingy 100 days (ocean) is next I Sam big brain
Luke “their quoting me on my own videos!!!”  Me quotes him 😏
You should download forge labs minecraft  parasite map. Do a survive 100 days on it and you should do a 200 day if it turns out good . Love your work keep up the great work. It's just great to come home from work and watch your vids . Makes my weekend so much better
Time to unwatch this video to see it again
Yay!!!!!!!
14:48  That sounds like a broken man
Hoi
really like ur videos but i am waiting for 4000 days in hardcore for so long mate
He finally uploaded I’m so happy
I will watch this again
It’s 30:01, I ain’t watching it
You probably have Emerald blocks for your brain cells. The only thing that explains this much of creativity :D
luke on steam there is a game called muck it is free do a 20 days (because you cant save in it)
Why didn't he just make shulker boxes?
"Stay Notable see you in the next on-"
26:59 1970
i would really love to be back home at day "69"
YAYAYAYAYYAYAAYAYAYY
think how diffrent this would be with a single crafting table
Luke is pretty notable ngl.
Where is 3000 days
That enderman in the thumbnail seems kinda sus ngl
Once 1.18 comes out you should do caves only.
Wow I would love to do it I'll just use my mine coins to buy the diffculty
Where is 3000 days?!?!!!
200 days with tors
I enjoy it
we just want Tors 200 days man
I have an idea, what about 100 days underground in minecraft.
Yay luke your the best.
Do you believe in God
Has he ever done a 100 days in skyblock ?
Almost perfect 30 miniutes
COOL
On his 2000 days world he only survived 935 days
You should craft some shulker boxes
how u got the tools
Hi
You could make a door using an iron trapdoor and a light/heavy weighted pressure plate(crafted with iron or gold).
Hgg
200 days
Started watching.....
This.... This man... This soldier survived 100 days in the end with no crafting table.... No wood.... Holy shit hown is this guy human
i'm sorry but that chorus fruit farm looks like a weed farm
_Clicks on video_ Luke: A M O N G  U S _Clicks off_
This video : Minecraft but you cant get netherite and diamonds are useless
3000 days
"this quake pro is giving me diarrhea" I really can't understand how tf you live w a low fov, 70 feels soo slow!
Poo
Why didn’t he just throw ender Pearl into the random portals that appear
I hate when he says java only for world downloads
you lasted 54 days. not 100. hit f3 to see the day.
I missed it...
Can I just ask how he knows the direction to ender dragon island?
do 100 days in the begining
ITS HERE
I love how he keeps wanting an enderchest when He can just have shulkerboxes. He's got more chests and shells than enderchests.
How did he get iron trapdoors?
Deadass, my dumbass seriously wondered why he didnt make shulker boxes cause i forgot he didnt have wood
There is a mod you could've got which are a ton of end islands with their own biomes. I forgot the name of the mod though. I think it was the end expansion mod I don't know.
what is going to be next? skybloxk?
ahh dimoionds worthless
100 days - in a cave?
The torch god gave him a torch obviously
Legit went to go get a snack for this lol
Dude you always end up building such good things with so little materials
“Oh they’re doing it, they’re quoting me on my own video” - Luke TheNotable
YESSS
instead of putting slabs for his ceiling he could just put it on the ground and then not have to worry how short his ceiling is
Should've named the shulkers Wilson and tried to talk to them. They're really uplifting fellas.
I knew this was next after the nether and superflat, etc
14:41 The BEST song 2021!
When is 3000 days comming ? Hmmmmmmmmmmm
4:40 how did u get those ladders?
"Because my infant daughter had a poo" idk why that kept on my mind
Im making history
I want this!
Pog is epic end
LTN YOU Should make volg video
Fun Fact: Luke TheNotable never forgets to take the dragon head at the end of the ship
200 DAYS PLEASE
Day 64 is a stack of days
2:45 that's what she said
time for modded 100 days
I did an End Survival challenge on my own a couple months ago and it was pretty cool! What I ended up doing was spawn with a Bonus Chest, which gives you a small amount of starter supplies like logs and wooden tools. Its not cheating, and being able to have a crafting table is a MASSIVE quality of life upgrade
NOOO I MISSSSSSED IT! Well frick.
That's pretty notab- Pretty notable
Yeet yay
Love the 100 day series
2 ideas for future vids  1 100 days in alpha mode 2 100 days in floating islands
Shulkers
388 million people are part of the most notable army
Work on 3000 days
You should make ur own Minecraft skin or have someone design one for u because I’m getting tired of Alex
11:55
OOO! It's exactly 30:00 mins! that's cool!
You could have used slabs  So you would scrape Edit: I commented this when he started his housw
I'm early
Can't you find a crafting table at end city's?
If you go to the nether, you can get a crafting table...
hey Luke you should do a live stream and play minecraft! (:  like if you think he should do it!!!
why
The end
So stressful trust me I know I have for 100 days
i was the 25252 person to like your video
3000 days? coming soon?
Omg so cool
its just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me yea you see it yep they're doing it right now quoting me in the comment section of my own video -Luke TheNotable
Could I make a video of a hundred minecraft days?
Best 30 minutes of my live
Imagine leaving the island...
I feel good watching this within 1 hr
BOIS IN THE NEXT WERE ALL GOINT TO SPAM HIM TO MAKE 3000 DAYS
Lifeless void dodododododo lifeless void dodododododododo lifeless void
Slow decent into madness
For anyone who wants to do this, there’s the option to be in a singular end biome if you decide to do that.
Why no cheese in video :(
would you kill a baby villager to kill a baby villager?
I like it
Yay early
What is an nft? And if Do you want makes you happy it makes us happy to
"My inventorys looking pretty sus!" *A M O G U S*
Yknow you can make a shulker box.  Shulker shells and a chest. You have a chest. Or two. or none. maybe.
Can you play with the toys again please
You can beat the dragon there is two ways take knockback and fly to the crystils or use enderperls You can also make a enderman farm with pears  to spawn endermite plus shuckers  Just if you for some reason make 200 days
When it's been a year 3000 days
We need the meme with the 4 black mans and the little girl, the first man 100 days in hardcore , the second 100 days in nether, the third 100 days in end, the fourth 100 days in who knows :)) and the little girl Luke stay notable bye
Luke the debatable
Me: *log on to youtube. My recommended section: We’ve got a Luke The Notable video for you that came out a hour ago.  Me: *Speechlessly clicks it and doesn’t even look and the thumbnail or title. Also me: I’ll just put it in my watch later section, who cares I’m just going to watch it right now anyway.
Wait but how did he get a torch
Now
"they're doing it right now, quoting me, in the comment section, on my own video" yes
This was really boring.Totally a waste of time
This ain’t a race he didn’t make 3000 days.
3000 daysssssszzz
Is it ironic that all of the 100 days videos are the same length
“Most of you just quote me look they are doing it right know
on day 78, the floor looks amazing!
Should have taken the ender chest. You can mine it with the diamond pickaxe and it’s extra storage that’s stays when broken
Get this man to 7 million bro so much effort
Hi
If you don’t start working on 3000 days hardcore Minecraft I will lead a mass unsubscription of thousands upon thousands. You will rue the day you decided make “100 days hardcore on an Amplified World”.
I’m sorry I’m so late  Eat your cereal
I'm enjoying this series
So, he's done superflat, nether, and the end. Can he do skyblock?   (I know you can't actuallyset skyblock to hard-core he can just show us his death count after its over.)
congratulations Luke! You have now conquered all 3 dimensions.
DO SOMTHING WITH MODS!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FAST
I don’t get it. He’s on hardcore and on day 5 he died but continued like it didn’t happend
I feel like spawning in with a crafting table would have made this just slightly more interesting and given it a few more options
What is 3000 days coming
He’s done just about evrything he’s survived 2000 days in the over world he’s done 100 days in two player, in creative, in the nether and now in the end There’s just one more he’s needing to accomplish and that’s 100 days in pixelmon
how to NOT fight with ender dragon:
"I'd kill a baby villager for a shulker box" Nobody gonna tell him the recipe?
This mincrad
i bet if you do 100 days in rlcraft you will get 4 million subs
You should do 100 days in a 100 by 100 border
You can also go to single biomes but the ender dragon won’t be there (I think)
He didn't make a anvil... :(
epic video
3:19 did he die. And just keep on with the run?????
love u
"ya see it, they're doing it right now, quotin' me, in the comment section, on my own video"
"Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me"  huh..
Ha imagine quoting LTN “how unoriginal”
Premirered 69 mintues.-. BRUH
Why don’t my notifications work for you Luke? Like I have notifications on but I don’t get them
100 days underwater
I thought you would do the 100 days of modded end
26:58 Last words the germans could hear Hitler say Day 100 "The allies finally did it they beat the end."
Among ussssss
I clicked faster than my dad left me
Can't accept that this video is 30 min 1 second.
Plz
Just so you know, you can tell how many days there are in the F3 menu. Although, it does start at day 0, so the actual day will be 1 day after.
Just asking um are u gonna make 2001 days and more?
Other YouTubers: have ads every 3 minutes on a 30 minute video making that 11 ads. ( the first ad when you click on the vid )     LTN: is a man of culture has ads every 6 minutes on a 30 minute video making the 6 total ads. First one when clicking vid and 5 through the vid.
Luke on average how many minecraft days do you play in a normal day?
10:00 thanks i will
100 days in minecraft with forgelabs
i just saw the premiere was 69 minutes ago
Nothing better then Luke the Notable
Did he not use shulker boxes
Why haven’t you don’t 3000 days yet
it premiered 69 minutes ago nice
I’m watching it on it was premiered 69 minutes ago
im watching this when it was 69 minutes premiered ago
love the floor
anyone else screaming shulker when he kept complaining about his inventory
@luke-the-notable. You should do 100 days in modded minecraft.  LIKE the better minecraft modpack. Or do 100 days modded dimension like with the better end and better nether mod's.
27:52 i assume this is in reference to his misguided attempt to trademark 100 days but what on earth is the second one?
You created this whole 100 day trend, they have gotten millions and millions of views. And you don't have 5 million subscribers.   SUBCRIBE
You know I'm you're not make any videos to 2021
Oh
permiered 69 minutes ago  nice
Why does he not make a shulker box?
Couldn’t he use the obsidian and make a nether portal
luke please do 100 days 2b2t or 100 days valorant
I saw this just 69 mins ago
I am so happy i am going to go at a brain surgery and i have 1 day till it starts and i can watch my fav YT a new vid and it is with my fav game  I love u Luke :)

10:26 Aaa you're teasing me  Naughty Naughty
"Most people just quote me"
3000 days
Da base is da best

You talks like a robot
200 DAYS IN THE END.

Here for day 69
Could you du a 3000 day hardcore minecraft?
pog
Someone tell me I’m not the only one who didn’t know Luke had a kid
To make a shulker box u need a chest and shulker shells. U had both
<sigh> If only you had access to sand and lime green dye to make lime green glass for the monument's eyes, they definitely would've matched your character's eyes almost perfectly
Very controversial there like
Love ur vids man
Dang im late
Luke you Could have made an anvil to combine the enchantments of the Diamond items that you liked using the iron that you got from the end city
Nice 👍
11:55 :)
Hey luke Im having a bad dat could you give me some advice
Will there be a 3000 day’s hardcore mode?
Not a nerd but I think that like that are in helmet with protection for is literally just to like the diamond helmet with nothing useful but not seriously both is the same
cool!!!
I forgot but can you take the enter chest with a silk touch pickaxe?

"most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me"- Luke TheNotable, 2021
hellooooooooo
Lukes clutch on day 28 way honestly more impressive than surviving 100 days
i missed the premiere on purpose. still early tho
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Quote me  -Luke TheQuotable
Once again, another video that is good to stall 3000 days.  and the friggin memes too
the
The mad man. he did it
Amoung us 🇺🇸😢
You should do 100 days without a pickaxe ;)
Next vide:Luke:I survived 100 days in....
Guys in 25:55how did he get a iron trapdoor because you cant craft them that means he cheated
100days beeng a scuid
*”my inventory is already looking pretty sus!”*    *”aMø nGùś”* *11:53*
how do you do live in the end        the only answer is he's a god. Tors help
Me seeing this video: yah this is just 100 days of end busting
Suggestion: maybe you can make a 1.000 special minecraft hardcore video, when you build dumb suggestions of the members of the channels. Ex: build a artificial mountain.
Oh nice, is this how he is going to “end” this series?
Yes
This was definitely not the best 100 day video but that is because you can’t really do much in the end
Aether Dimension, maybeee???
I lost braincells just thinking about how stressful this would be to film
Man the mining is truly endless
did you die before  3000 days
called out of work just to watch the new ltn
i love your vids pls make them more often
You are the best YouTube’s ever
Poor soul had to eat nothing but chorus fruit
Hes the avatar  Overworld  Nether  End  And hopefully Ocean
GOOD😎😎😎
I question why you do these 100 days challenges I also want you to go to 1k days in the end at least >:】
Can you please do 100 rounds of call of duty zombies.
Do small  videos 🙂
11:55 AMONGUS
100 days minecraft cave when?
I came in in 1 houre
I like the house 😊
im here hi you are great and hows all yours days going
For the house, you can make a 3 block tall ceiling but put slabs on it so it end up not bonking your head but endermen still can't get in :D         Oh, oops XD I didn't see the near the end of the vid...
stack on minutes
Do 200 days in super flat
Hello, I came in the first hour am I too late?
AMONGUS 11:55
Challenge accepted ❤️!
"there see it, they are doing it right now, quoteing me,in the comment section,on my own video" -Luke The Notable 2021
"yup there doing it right now quoting me ine the comment section on my own video"
30:55 But if you using the elytras sapratliy you gonna get more use from them because there have ther own use sapratliy.
Everyone: I can't wait for 3000 days! Luke: I bout to end these peoples whole career
"Yep, they're doing it right now. Quotin' me. In the comment section." -LukeTheNotable 2021
not me being an unskilled 17 year old mcdonald’s worker watching this before i go in and work a 3-11. damn.
when are you going to do 3000 days
Do 3,000 days in your hardcored world
“I’d kill a baby villager for a shulker box” he says, despite him being able to craft them
I’m happy because this is a Minecraft video where OWO is not here AMOGUS
I WAS HERE REMEMBER MEEEEEE
Were is the torch from? Is it from a shulker? Is it from an end city? Maybe Luke just spawed one in? Its the great mystery that has plagued humanity for thousands of years
when you want to finish the game but your to lazy to find the end portal:
you the best 3000 days!!!
11:54 AMONGUS
He was obviously hearting comments who have LTN stans with the other hand
Lukie pookie I’ve been waiting for this
At this point he’s just putting off 2000 days with all these 100 days projects
Hello it's me again but I just want to remind you can you do 100 days in your Sky because you might be able to do this I haven't seen the whole video right now but hopefully you can do it and might be cool since you're doing 100 days in here and you've done 100 days and then another here's a new challenge it's 100 days in the sky you ordered a hundred and a lot of places but not the sky
You didn’t need to build a super long bridge to get to the dragon, you could have just went through an end gateway
Pog
Still waiting for 200 days tors
hy u like disco floor why dont u build a floor with same blocks dude its funny XD
11:52
Does he realize we don’t care abt this an wanna  see 3000 days
The fact that Luke has shulker shells and chests in his inventory but can’t make shulker boxes because no crafting tables just physically hurts.
I will do it I’ll tell u guys when I’m done and if I finish
1.02 Million subs till 4M
Why not just make a shulcher box
After caves and cliffs, Mojang should work on an End update so Luke can survive in the End like he did in his 100 days in the Nether.
💙
When is 3000 days
i like your hose
YAY! A new 100 day video I’m so happy :D.
Yeah You spawned a torch, Mojang Should Fix OPEN TO LAN Cheats
Worthless items like diamonds
Sure you could use 3 blocks and make the statue be goth but it more looks like a very bad German leader's mustache more then anything
Do mods
11:55 A M O N G U S
LTN Fans: Give us 3000 day  LTN: 100 days Nether and End
200 days now
13:36 omg i should not have laughed so hard on this lmao
Hello
He did my idea yay
Why am I watching this at 4 in the morning.
When are you going to do 3,000 days hardcore
ive been wating today for this video and it FINALLY relised
Hello My Name is Luke The Notable and welcome to the end but the video is starting
That was incredibly boring 😅
The End Dimension really need an update...
Luke the no table xD
"Don't get me wrong; I still love reading comments its just that you're pretty unoriginal and just quote me" -Luke 2021
Can u do 3000 days of normal hardcore please
50 minutes ago yaay
He’s done the regular, the nether, super flat, creative, and now the end. I can’t wait to see what he does next!
Good job Luke, nice video
HOW JUST HOW?!?!
City at the End of the Game achievement...
11:55 AMOG US
info: the damage of explosions is calculated based on the exposure of your feet therefore, if theres a hole surrounded with obisidan, you take no damage
imagine for a second, this is just a concept.  as you spend more time in the end, you slowly corrupt into an enderman itself (faster movement, taller model, hatred of water.) it'd be pretty cool if a mod like that existed.
18:41, whats it called, EndFT!?
11:55 AMONGUS
I thought this was the end of the 10p days series. I'm now very sad but happy
You should add a mod that could Revert chests or other wood things to Wood planks!
100 days Minecraft hardcore skyblock lol
I'm early for once
Honestly luke what do you think the shulker box crafting recipe is?
I like how Luke's content has slowly become less and less family friendly
100 days in minecraft but you cant leave the water
wait didn't you have curse of vaneshing on your chestplate?
16:27 you should be happy you didn't work at the McDonalds near me.
Hello fellow human beings
One hundred days of Nether Endin get it? Nether and End although seriously he should make this transport system or command block that sends him through and make a video on it, 100 likes to make this comment notable enough for the notable to see it!
Do 100 days muck
Yes sus amogus
How did u get the torch tho
His monument looks like female hitler
Do more nether

Couldn’t he just break the end city chests and use those for shulker boxes
you forgot 200 days w/ tors
When’s 200 day with tor’s?
I hope 1.19 is a end update like end stone dirt
hi

look at Cxlvxn
This is boring af do 3000 days already or post a  video saying died
just puked... time to watch luke the notable.
Hi
Can you do a 100 days no crafting video
"Its just most of you guys are just quoting me, there you go, you're probably quoting me right now." -Luke TheNotable
100 days in adventure mode when?
17:16 what did he said?
respect
He could’ve used shulker boxes??? Edit: He could have used the shulker shells he got and take the chests in the end city’s to make it
When will, the next fortnite  video be
still wating for 3000 days😊😢😢
My guy didn’t know about shulker boxes at first
3000 days plz
It’s so funny how he said “they all quote me” but I saw like 2 people quote him
He did a lot of cheating
Yay
Eh I guess I’ll take it

GTA 6 will come out before you post 3000 days
I feel the nether is the most dangerous dimension
I can make it three colours just hav two make it goth lmao
goddamit its 1:51 i was just about to sleep
é
Try living on a infinite dimention, that update where you throw a book(with a random note on it) on a nether portal and generates a entirely new dimension
0:01 Luke no you'll get canceled for black face
Hi
After seeing what you can do in Minecraft, this makes me stick to a survival world better instead of dying at iron and never revisiting it again.
I can unwatch this video  I just have to remove it from my watch history
HMMMMM MARIO TIME MAGIKARP AND GYRADOS FROM POKEMON!!!
I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT WAITING FOR THIS AND IT PAID OFF
Do 100 days at sea
This is a lot of end
18:14 I was not expecting that

Is he on harcore or no? I'm so confused...
You should've made Shuler boxes throughout
Let’s go!
Vailense is the answear!   luke the notable-

THE LACK OF SHULKER BOXES  DRIVES ME INSANE
Nothing ignore this comment
The fact that he didn’t call the stone “Ender cheese” makes me sad Edit: I’m not actually sad I was kidding
Hi
On another server a glitch happened so whenever i died i spawned right Where the dragon egg would spawn, so i started the end Empire so i paid people to get me overworld stuff
Don't quote me -Luke the notable
Everyone gangsta until Luke spends his entire life on a Skyblock map
hi love you
E
Best minecraftuber i've ever seen
luke
Anyone else remember when he made fortnite one hundred drops
HOW DID YOU GET IRON TRAPDOORS IN THE END????
Do 200 days with the tors
Hope you release 3000 days soon
I'm not telling you where, but one of these days is titled "Day Ur Mom"
You always had storage problems even tho you could make tens of shulker boxes bruh  Edit: crafting shulker boxes doesn't need a crafting table it just needs putting 2 shells upon each other in just 2 cells it doesn't need the 9 cell crafting table
Please consider helping me reach 1,000 Subscribers! 😂 That will make you Notable!
You will live a thousand days on everything except three thousand days
The thumbnail is quite concerning, chief.
breh
The end bith

27:11  Therapist: noteable hitler isn't real he can't hurt you  noteable hitler...

Pog
I wanted to scream "make a shulker box". Realized there's no crafting table... makes you realize the humble power of wood, huh?

Hello

AYO MADE IT TO THE LIVE PREMIERE!!
İlk ve milk
next video: playing hardcour minecraft with my child
Wanted to comment on how your super flat video inspired me to attempt the challenge, now im 1600 days deep(i ended up adding data packs to craft end portals so I could finish the game after beating the wither). Really enjoyed it so thanks!
He should have put in a end wood mod or something
I finally made it to the live primer
Hey notable please continue this series I wonder what are the things you can do here in the END.
Make 3k days in hardcore not keep making different ones
the real reason luke is not making 3000 days is because he forgot the password to his computer and bought a new one to play on these
Yes ma man is back
43 mins ago
My only thought was why he doesnt make shulkerboxes???
Ok
Early
AWESOME VID !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Yup quoting me, in the comment section”
YEAHHH
Luke holds the fastest time for going to the end. He got there the first minute he started
YAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAAYYAAYYAYAYAAYAYYAAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAAYYAYAYYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYYYAYAYAYAAYAYA
when is 3000 days of minecraft coming?
Im finally kinda early on a ltn vid
Yey
There is no one that can replicate this man of pure gold.
Luke is the only person who can make a seemingly impossible challenge look easy
It's The End, but ironically, it's only the beginning.
you’re the first person in minecraft history to ever even dare survive in the end without the help of the better end mod let alone in hardcore
You should try on a new skin! Unless you don't wanna...    Not gonna do anything bout that
If this game is for kids then he do you play lol
Luke really said some onamonapia
Looks like the end is the start
Boop
to people saying the torch was cheated in: nope, there are 4 torches that spawn on the center bedrock pillar in the nest.
when 3000 days
Bruh the i watched the trailer a minute ago
Woah!
120 016th!
Yay....:/
This guy just did the impossible lol
How do you even survive? Food is scarce
To think I've been watching Luke since his 1st 100 drops and now he has a daughter
NEW VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
do 100 days underground
There is thing more important than do my homework and this is one oh them
if you disliked this video   like the video and LEAVE and sub
3000 days be like: for the next 100 days im gonna mine endstone
Props to you for all the effort that went into this
Its sad how he swapped the iron with the diamond helmet without realising the decline of his aurmour bar lol
PLeasze continue nether 100 days to 200 days I like it
I MISSED IT!!
Sup luke
How did he get the torch?
do 200 days with tors
yaa
So thats why Ltn was posting so many memes
My biggest fear is Luke uploading and it says “I survived 2513 days in Minecraft Hardcore” 😅
poggers😂
“Most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me. Yep, they’re doing it right now. Quoting me. You n the comment section” -Luke the Notable, 2021
Alternate title : 100 days without crafting
The chorus fruit farm in the basement is the End equivalent of Luke The Notable on Day 420
2 questions 1. how did you get torches:? 2. how did you get ladders?
EPIC
Day 90 I started making drugs out of chorus flower
25:08 "Don't get me wrong. I still love reading comments, it's just most of you are pretty unoriginal, and just quote me. Do you see it? Yep. They're doing it right now! Quotin' me. In the comment section. On my own video." -Luke TheNotable
Love your vids bro
Shucker boxes? Did he really not use them once?!
You should do 100 Days in The End with a single dirt block and an oak sapling. You talked about it and it made me wonder.
What if the reason Luke hasn’t uploading 3000 days is cuz he died
Thanks I have my own series of 100 days hardcore  on my twitch
Letss goooo
Hii
should have went to the overworld through the end portal
Everyone: When will you stop milking 100 days with concepts which aren't even fun for you to play?   Luke: 🐄
Can you do part 2 in super flat world please i really enjoyed it and I bet lots of people did too any way have a good summer and nice vid and good luck getting to 4 million :)
Okay but…      3000 days
If you break blocks with your fist to transport up or down it will be incredibly impossible..
Lets gooo it’s out
200 days with tors plz
Few things that I have to point out because it won't stop bothering me: - You could use slabs (I'm pretty sure you can get them from end cities) for the roof of your house, it would still be enderman-proof but wouldn't feel so claustrophobic - When fighting the Ender Dragon, you should stand in the bedrock portal and hit him while jumping, because this way the dragon can't attack you - Yes, iron helmet with protection IV is much better than a diamond one with no protection  And the most important thing, stay notable! :D
When is 3000 days coming
But why he brought religion into it
Luke if you press f3 then you can see your Minecraft day count
Ngl I like Clxyxn's 100 days in the end better that had story, plot, and mods
And obviously since not everything stacks to 64 (and we all know some things like armor don't stack at all) sixteen ender pearls are a full stack
Does he know about shulker boxes?
Luke I know that you use that the Alex skin. I made a Luke the Notable skin. It's an Alex skin with a LTN on it
Your monument reminds me of h!tler
Hi
Which was more painful: This or attempting "how did We get here?"
The term "end of the world" fits this video
is this... the end?
Do 100 days on bedrock edition
If you want something original eat a Werther's
What about 3000 days minecraft
Who else is going to survive in The End?
WHY DO YOU TAKE 50 YEARS TO UPLOAD?
when will 3000 days and 200 days with tors come luke
After 100 days in nether
This was amazing lol. He's the first one to do this challenge without click baiting lmao.
Okay, I know he said he wasn’t going to continue this, but now the portals open, why doesn’t he get one day in the over world and then continue here? Crafting table, sapling, dirt, etc… but ONLY one day. I think it might be more interesting.
This video was notable
do tors 200 days
100 days in an amplified world  100 days in a border(i am not sure about the size)  100 days without breaking blocks  100 days in an only (any biome you want) world  these are my ideas
LTN are you going to make videos on halo infinite?
where 3000 days
Yoooo
I love your videos man!!!!! Keep up the great work man!!!!!
FIRST HOUR
how has it already been 30 moins
U should do ocean 1

would you ever consider doing 100 days challenges in famous modpack versions like RLcraft?
POG
YAYYYYY IM EARLYYYY
Where 3000 days ?
I play minecraft because I am 6
I would rather 100 days adding up to 3k for Mr. King Ruler of Existence Luke The Notable 's health and what not. All in favor say aye
I was curious how to survive in the end for 100 days since its like no trees or animals
It’s notable time
Yay a Luke vid
It's the end literally we will all die in the end especially in that sub 10 min   speedrun
69 days in hardcore
Im Starting To Be Suspicious About 3000 Days In Hardcore Minecraft Maybe Just Maybe He Died And He Doesnt Want Us To Know About It??
I’m sure you’re the authority on the existence of heaven.
First to say 100 day in adventure
He is going to 3000 days poggere
26:45 29:40 how you get torch
I have an idea for you Luke the very notable. Maybe the next 100 days could be in an old world idk if that's in java bc  I play in bedrock. Anyways I love your channel have a good rest of your day or night.
Therapist: hitler Alex isn’t real it can’t hurt you  Hitler Alex: day 85
I sense this will be on trending
Sir please do a warzone video
This is very notable
You have inspired me to not only finally try Hardcore after almost 10 years of playing (I'm guestimating, I didn't keep track of the exact year I started, but it was not long after my then bf now husband told me they added survival) but to also try to make a video about it, and no mater how that goes I'm learning a lot about the process!
"dont get me wrong, i still love reading comments, It's just most of you are pretty unoriginal and just quote me. yeah you see it? yep theyre doing it right now! quote me! in the comment section. on my own video!"
I'm proud to have been in the premier. When this blows up i can say that i was here
ender dragon chillin *LukeTheNotable has joined the server* ender dragon: *"Wait why do I hear boss music?"*
"my inventory is so full!" luke then proceeds to take shovels, diamonds, gold and iron which have literally no use and just take up more space
That was...GUCHI
No mom joke?  That's not notable at all lol like your mom...
when's 3000 days coming out Luke?
3000 days Minecraft hardcore please

Hi
Finely I hope he gets as rich as the 1000 world
Earned  A sub
I saw someone suggest One Block Skyblock 100 Days, but I also think you should do 100 Days in the Ocean!
Bro your an inspiration to millions. I swear no one has the impact that you do
:D

how to tell if LTN stan has one or more of the following: -LTN face on profile picture -has luke or notable in name -says the word "notable" in comment
Is this going to be in video 2 like not this comment but the live?
Ngl 100 days end only seems kinda lame like what is je gonna do collect ender cheese?
Yes
Turning the end into the overworld?
Give me a L, give me a T, give me a N... what's the spell?
Luke TheProfitable back at it again
Hi
I Exited
To all my comrades awaiting the premier I say: LET’S GET NOTABLE
he will probbley go to end city to survive cause he can't spawn in the end with dragon   edit: LukeTheNotable if you see this are you going to make some fortnite content soon?
Heres how i survived 3 days in the end so first i spawned on a island took some chorus fruit and a ender man started chasing me and i got shot by a shulker than i levitated up and entered that place with those 2 chests i found diamond projectile protection pants and i put those on and chorus fruit mlg and i dound a pickaxe and made a small shack and i found another end city my demise a shulker named robert who had a quick hand tried shooting at me and. I was like all the other kids with the pumped up kicks and i needed to run need to run but i coudnt outrun his gun
Eeeeee
I didn’t watch it yet but I know it’s gonna be gooood
i waited this entier thing
I think this is a metaphor! The “end” of the wait for 3000 days?
Pog
I have no idea how this vid is gonna end unless its just him making chorus fruit farms and teleporting everywhere  or mods. thats a possibility I guess...
Nice
Can't wait
Notable  (adjective) worthy of attention or notice; remarkable (noun) 1. a famous or important person 2. creator of Minecraft 100 Days; the most notable; Luke

The 100 days minecraft hard-core mode with tors was the video that made me like watching this channel
Pog
Hi
H-hey luke how to know when is 3000 days I'm very excited

PLS 3000 DAYS PLS P,S PLS

Cool
I expected someone crying in the thumbnail but I think this is the first time we don’t see that, it’s just Alex *Consuming* a chourous fruit.
Less goo
1 time I did 100days I'm the never
Yay!
The reason he hasn't uploaded 3000 days, but has uploaded this is that he died.
100 days at the end is a good idea
notebl

How can you survive without a mod
This is gonna be one of the Minecraft videos that will be nostalgic in the future.

This is one notable man
lesssgooo
The new videos coming out in 46 minutes

If  Matthew Patthew is correct he may turn into an enderman
Anyone else find this dude randomly, and started watching all his videos up to this? Just me?
luke gonna harvest chorus fruitt and raid for 99 days and kill dragon somehow on day 100 or have better end mod on
Good vid watched it through l Its odd bc it says to video is premiering in 51 minutes  but thanks youtube for letting me watch it early lol
This dude is definitely gonna make a endermen farm
Lets see what kind of crazy builds will be created by luke in this series!
Pls post 3000 days
POV: You think LTN uses mods.
This vid will be notable
Hi
Why I waited all morning for this and I have to wait 55 minutes
Ooooooh booooooooy!
OooOO it's nearly time laddies! time to watch the notable eat chorus fruit for the rest of his life in the end.
hi
Guess Luke is going to speedrun Minecraft
4M is good
my favorite part was when he said that thing about my mother
The End is near  Luke: and i am here.
Ya
I’m excited 😆
In so excited and sleepy at the same time
Yeye
LNT u the man
YESSSSS
Could you start a little earlier i need to go in 20:30
Yooooooooo
Luke... when are you gonna play with vievers like 100 days with people or something thx
E
Lets hope LTN does not die
Do 100 days skyblock
Why everyone saying this geezer dominates everything. I like the mans content but he’s just an average minecraft player
Surviving in the End is SO hard. I'm excited to see how he does
🤟🤟🤟😘✔️😂
Imagine next video 200 days with tors
Ok

POGGGGGGG
Eeee
Hi

69 MINUTES LEFT ITS A SIGN
My vid premieres in 69 minutes
Why did Luke beat the dragon in 1 sec  He started at the end
**insert funny joke about him posts this instead of 3000 days**
He's just making excuses for 3000 days but he's doing it good
hi
Overworld Nether End
Ima watch it later when I go off
Pog
Dnndd
Everyone we must worship our savior
I didn't think he was actually gonna make one
I don't how you are gonna survive
This guy is seriously going to beat Minercraft on every realm. Somebody stop this notableman
Can you plz make 3000 day in hardcore Minecraft or 200 days with tors plz
100 days in the end is better than nothing, so quit complaining about 3000 days.
I thought he meant the end of him doing minecraft and that he wasn’t doing three thousand days 😂
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you  “Luke the notable”  the man that  conquers the unconquerable.  Kills the unkillable,  and does the undoable.  The man,  the myth,  *the notable.*
Luke is Like monke they have passion
I will not get any likes
Rosses are red viloits are blue thoght this was 3000 days the end is fine to.
Props for living that long! *Now survive 100 days in the aether*
Pogggggg
Eating overworld food be like: Good Eating nether food be like: Good Eating End food be like: T E L E P O R T

Why don't you try "100 days in the Color Dimension" (The Color Dimension is in the April Fools update of Minecraft Last year)
End
Op
This is indeed going to be very notable
I’d love to watch the premiere but it’s at 3:00am for me or so and I’ve got therapy so I need my sleep..but I’m sure it’s gonna be awesome! I’ll watch it afterward :D
3000 days luie

POG
Moustache alderman is worse than normal and idk y

Just to remind everyone. Luke is waiting on the minecraft update 1.18. Which will be happening later this year. It's so that he can show off everything new during those 1000 days of 3000 days.
Well imma watch this tomorrow
Its 11:27 here i dont think i can do it i cant watch it in the premeire :(
6000 days go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Sadly I won’t be able to watch it live
O no
Next video: 100 days Minecraft caves?
360? No...361 degrees.
How is this even going to be possible
I want to watch this but I need to sleep... I'll watch it when I wake up...
Lol how is he gonna get wood?
You should try 100 days as a Villager, where you can’t get materials from anywhere other than villagers or iron golems killing mobs and you cannot leave the village within 50 blocks of the furthest house. Would be a fun idea!
Questionable thumbnail but ok
this is gonna be so cool
Where is 3000 days 🥲
When’s tors 200 days coming out 🤨
How
is this the end of the 100 days series?
I shall wait all day and watch all day
why does the enderman weirdly resemble the Purple Guy from the FNaF franchise
Can’t wait!!!!!!!
Yes
premiere gang |                           V
I don't know what to comment without being unoriginal or seeming like an over aggressive fanboy
Rice
Hmmm 100 days end Ňőţĕđ
Luke u da best I have been here since 10 k I know u won’t see this but keep up the great work
I'm on philippines and it 11:17  pm  ohhhh it tonight
Here for live premier or should I say I was here for the more NOTBLE virsion of the video
Hey if your going to show a video then you show it to everyone don’t you
will he go to the nether
How tf are you not at 4 mil. Your content makes you deserve more than 20mil
The beginning in the End.
I just want 200 days with Tors. IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK.
beat minecraft by escaping the end and killing the dragon and then you spawn in the world, luke is playing minecraft backwards today
I HAVE 30 MINUTES TO WATCH IT AND ITS A PREMIERE NOOOOOOOOOO 😔
K cool
Notable.
Have a spooky day
Are you going to defeat the ender dragon
I wonder what’s gonna happen
I’m scared
He died on day 3001
Once Luke reaches 4M it will be a very notable event in his channel history
Hi
AnD nOw ThE rEaL pRoFiTs BeGiN - Luke thenotable
YES! HE DID IT! HE FUCKING DID IT!
I’m so excited  😀😀😀😀😀
E N D E R M A N V I D E O
Luke, are you gonna post R6 anytime soon I’m just wondering because I really enjoyed your 100 drops as recruit vid!
I have a video idea what about 100 games in roblox as I know I would watch that
100 Days RLCraft
I wonder if Luke would ever make a 100 days in a modded hardcore Minecraft
anyone who dislikes is someone who is expecting 3000 days hardcore and rages so hard that the dislike button turns on
Wait are you gonna beat the ender dragon because the end city portal doesn't come until you kill it so we already beat the game
theres no way he can survive in the end
I am sure I will NOTable to that  LTN did
When the world wanted him the most he arrived
Why is alex the default skin
This could potentially be the highest like-dislike ratio video on yt if everyone likes and nobody dislikes until premier
sorry it brookelynn_ty
everyone:finally 3000 days minecraft ha- luke:100 days end everyone:Omg the next video will be 3000 days then
Wooop wooop stay notable peeps
Next you should do the nether 200 days
You know when its a 100 days it's gonna be really notable
Yo
tomorrow will be my birthday
This will be notable
Ngl I thought he meant the end of the Minecraft hardcore 3000 days series in the title.
your so lame  dont do this  pls
hi you a good man
STAYNOTABLE
I subscribed
Luke tries to do a 100 days in the end and gets the ender dragon to die in such a pose that only legends would narrate in there stories! 🐉
Nice
When the enderman is sus…
Reminder set
Bruhh I want to watch it as soon as it comes on but it comes out at 2 in the morning it's 12 right now Should I stay up? Like for yes
Ok
its 10:58 AM, 2 hours until the premiere,  hoping my future self like it,   STAY NOTABLE
Notable is Notable so be Notable            If your not Notable bruh
Yes
Sheeeeeshh
Always remember that luke can survive
Next vid 100 days only on grass
always forget about this account until another banger comes out
We are the first notables that are waiting to watch this video
Suggestion for 3000 Days (or 4000 if he’s already done recording 3000) disassembling an end ship and rebuilding it by the shack in the clouds with the dog he doesn’t talk about. It kinda seems like a cool idea.
This video definitely will be notable!
You timed the premiere to the Czech vs Denmark game. How unnotable.
WOOOOO
Bet this won’t get liked and pin
I feel Spoiled
I am notable (thanos)
Let's sing a song
pov:
YESSSIIIRRRR
This was a good concept at the beginning,  but now it’s just boring
Luke is the kind of guy that would microwave a pizza for efficiency.
I watch all of Luke TheNotables videos!
I’m not gonna set a reminder today I’m not going to wait I might just look later at 1:00
5 years later: LTN: 100,000 Days in Hardcore Mode Me: Finally! *looks at video length... The video: 196 hours long... Me: holy sheep
And get that 300 days done soon I’ve gotta long drive down to Florida from NY and I need something to watch
Pog
*O*
I already know he's gonna dominate the endermen cause he literally dominated the overworld and the nether,this man is notable AND unstoppable!
To whomsoever sees this comment after premier: It's notable
Brit this is gonna be freaking good
I kind of called it..so..ocean next?
can't wait!
What?! No I want now! Grr Okay I wait
I can't wait
Ummmm one question how will that work?
LTN is just going to be raiding for 99 days then killing the dragon
That enderman in the thumbnail wanted to know if you had games on your phone.
Wait, in this dimension its almost impossible to get wood or stone.
This is going to be one Notable video
Thumbnail Alex looks weird as heck
Another delay for 3000 lol

100 days in the ather mod world
The enderman in the thumbnail looks like he has a moustache
