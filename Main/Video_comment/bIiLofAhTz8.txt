Personally I think that well it depends on the restrictions in the us but if they start to calm down I would be like ok wot do we want act quick but not to quick if u know wot I mean ps love ur vids💕💕
If anyone’s thinking that she copied ari. She didn’t. Gabi got engaged first
Get a date and get a venue before you get a dress. The dress should be close time last but not last. Hope this helped😁😁😁
I love your face mask. It matches with the bridal look and you!!!
gabi you look soo beautiful 👑❤
cograts guys on your engagement so happy for you. you look like a  princess .  I am so excited to see you getting married
I love your makeup at the end what lipstick do you use xxx
Please tell us the product that you used before getting the allergic reaction lol
Can Colin do a ring story all about your ring! Love the prayer!
I am your biggest fan 😁
Congrats on engagment Queen ✨💖
I just wanted to let you know if you ever see this that i was at my moms wedding and she said that she wishes she would have not been so stressed planning and do more enjoying
You should figure out the Date first then book it, if the venue u booked is booked that day see what other options they have (then u could change ur date, mine was for June 6th 2020 but due to rona I changed my date to October 24th 2020) have fun planning!
Congratulations on the engagement. I’ve watched your videos since it started and I feel so connected to you and I think it’s very cool that you guys got engaged on my birthday, not that it matters, I just think it’s so amazing because you got me through middle school.
The prayer made me cry. Good bless you and your family Gabi. You really do have a good heart.❤️
Princess about to become a queen

#covidbride here too! I got engaged last April and am getting married this September! The first thing my fiancé and I did was book our venue and our photographer! I found my photographer through IG and my aunt got married at my venue when I was younger! Zola and The Knot are seriously so helpful in wedding planning ❤️
gabi looks like gwen stacy 💓💞💓💞💓
Dress should be picked like 9 to 6 months before your wedding. Styles change and prices too. Focus in the things that you can book out the way. Velnues, wedding invitations, wedding list, bridesmaids Colorado and themes. Food theme also! Good luck with everything gabi! And congratulations!
I NEED TO SEE THE DRESS
I also bought my dress a year earlier 😅 & it was the first one I tried on. That same day I tried on about 15 dresses. But the first one was the one ! mine was size smaller. It motivated me to lose weight 😬 which thank God I did. 😅
Omg congrats! She looks a lot like niki in this blog!
I did my dress first !!
I planned my wedding all by myself and the first thing your should do is get a wedding planning book. It’s super helpful to keep you organized and it breaks down what you should get done each month leading up to the big day!
i just know her dress is gonna be so beautiful
did u die??
My mom is a wedding planer she got her title in 2020 and it made her really happy :)
Venue, Dress/ Fashion, Book Vendors, Everything Else💜
Gabi looked amazing in the dress at 2:54!!
Do dress first wedding dresses tend to take a long time to make
I can tell she’s so excited whenever she says engaged or married or anything wedding related her eyes light up congratulations Gabi I’m so happy that you’re so happy💖
Congratulations 🎈🎊🍾🎉 gabi
I knew you were engaged l saw the ring on the finger when you sang where are you Christmas
You look stunning with blonde hair 😍
She has deffo chosen a dress like the royal family do she likes England lo done so I’m sure her and Colin will dress the royal look princessy  king queen fairy 🧚‍♀️
U can get allergies to any cosmetic products even if u have using the same product for many years or months. I developed dermatitis
Your really pretty congratulations on the engagement
My dad is getting married it’s super exciting! Try to get him a gift . Check on Etsy
She looks like jesschic so much now
we have the same phone!!!!!!
looking at youour engagement pics in a princess bathroom while you sh*t is a ✨vibe✨
Wait, Gabby... did you guys have to get tested to shop there?
book a date and venue first! make sure to get the dress at least 8 months before the wedding!!!
I am so happy for you guys! OMG...IM DYING TO SEE THE WEDDING DRESS
I know what dress she picked! I found it online
I’m literally so excited for uuuuuuuu!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  Hope your better though🤧🤧❤️❤️
Congratulations gabi I'm so happy for you❤️❤️😘😘😘
Congratulations on your Engagement Gaby 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽  🎉🍾🥂👰🏼‍♀️💍
cake tastinggg
Ik you probably wont see this but, my parents got remarried and they booked the venue first and got everything ready like the dress, food, etc. That way if the Venue only has a date really close they are not stressed with everything! I hope this helps but if it doesn't I hope you have a wonderful wedding!!!!Much love <3
I used the knot to plan! Super helpful. I got my dress before we set the date, booked the venue, etc. So I think you’re on the right track.
Cinderella ❤️❤️
That 3rd dresss!!!
Gabi you literally bring such a light into my life I want you to know that. Your videos bring me peace and happiness in a time right now when i need it the most. Thank you so much  <33 Also I wanna say I love the time you make for god in your videos at the end. It is so refreshing to see your faithful outlook on life and it has inspired me to become closer to the Lorde. i love youuuu
i’m sorry but like gabi was wearing ripped mom jeans (which is so cute on her) old gabi would neverrrr
My mom can plan anything . Just call my mom haha 😂 You should put your wedding dress on display after your wedding. It would be so beautiful to see :)
OMG SHE FINALLY GOT ENGAGED I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR LIKE 3 YEARS
So many happy tears for you AHHH xoxoxoxo
Gabi: mirror panarama  Me: oh, jeans!!
Ur lips are so pretty @ 10:47

Congrats! I’m a wedding videographer, the thing you want to do before anything is book your venue. Places get booked quickly
Congrats😍BTW you said the dress was the first one you tried on sooooo like we know which one it is 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣(I puased the video)
Omg you got engaged on my birthday
🥳🥳🥳🎉 love hearing the Word at the end. God bless ❤️
Congratulations!!! I’m happy for you and I know you’re extremely happy.
Try The Knot website. I am planning my wedding right now. It is stressful, especially in COVID time. You can do it. Ask your friends and family for help. If you know who will be in your bridal party, ask them for help too. Congratulations! ☺️
Princess are you ok and congrats on the engagement❤️🥳😢
Current bride here! I picked a date, colors , and then choose my venue. And I just picked my dress yesterday!
I’m so happy for you and glad ur still vlogging! Very proud that you owned up to your actions and keeping your head up n moving forward!!! Ur human and supposed to make mistakes!! It’s how u handle them that makes the difference and you did well!! Congratulations on ur engagement and hope for the best for you and Colin!!
Who’s here from tiktok
I found my dress early (possibly before venue)... but definitely pick a day (or a couple) and then venue next. Sign up for something wedding planning websites.
In the beginning you sounded like eugenia cooney 😥 feel better gabi!!!
Love you you are going to be so beautiful!
thank you so much Gabi. this video made me emotional for many reasons but one main is the devotion you have in your religion. I am catholic and my goal this year is to be more devoted. you inspire me so much. congrats again to you and Collin. May you both have eternal happiness and love.
I got engaged this year too!!! We’ll be going on the same adventure together !!!! Yayyy 🧡🧡
We saw the first dress tho u showed it to us without the blue for a sec
Picking the venue is the first thing you should do for sure! Venues go by so fast! But before you go venue shopping, you should know what your guest count is and what your wedding date is.  With COVID still being a factor, what I’ve heard people do is make different guest lists: the ideal list, the cut down list and the bare minimum list.  I’m so excited for you two!! Congratulations!!🎉🍾
I dmed you some suggestion!!!!
Why did u change your name back?
Watching this vlog for the 20th time waiting for the next one lol
Oohhh Gabi we had an allergic reaction at the same time! Hope you feel better queen ❤️
First,Congratulations! I’m so happy for you both 🥰 Secondly,I am engaged & a bride to be as well. We are definitely having a small intimate ceremony since we both come from small families & since we’ve met our “friends” stopped coming around (long story). I have found a very cozy place call Big Cedar Lodge with the cutest chapels & very fancy wedding packages with gourmet catering provided that I’m considering for our big day. As far as a dress I am absolutely stuck! Uhg.
That nude shirt is so cute where did you get it from
OMG CONGRATSSS I LOVE U SO MUCH I WOULD CRY IF YOU REPLEYD I LOVE YOU AND NIKI💓💓💓💓💓💓💞💞💕💞💓💖💖💞💖💞 LOVE YOUR DREES AND GOD BLESS YOU FOR MANY MORE YEARS🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Pick a venue first and then they’ll provide you with dates that are available. Then I would say pick a dress so you can tell the stores when your date is so they can order it and book your fitting appointment.
Did her lips got allergic reaction too. It looks over done 🤪
OMG YOU CHANGED THE NAME BACK!!!! yessss:)
Hi my love! Definitely choose your date first! You have my number, text me!
Did they give you an epipen? I had an allergy response and they gave me an epipen
God is telling you to wait to go shopping.
Follow jamie wolfer here on youtube, she's a wedding planner and she's got great advice on different wedding topics! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAcY6YGgF-RgGYXTsOENbA
Why blur it out tho 🙄🙄
I looked for a venue and decided on a date first and then got my dress but im sure whatever you do it will be a memorable and beautiful day! :)
In one video you said that you would where those cinderella heels on your wedding day!
love the prayer 🤍 thank you for sharing gabs
I'm so happy for you🥺
I think u should do it your way because you know what it’s your wedding I’ve been watching you since you two started dating and I’m so happy to see that you guys are finally getting married congrats @gabi
I think it's unfair your friend booked you in to look at dresses without consulting Niki...your twin sister or even Alex/your mum 🤷🏻‍♀️
How it's  possible  always that  feed  get me videos  like this
Today the wedding dress tomorrow pulling the pin on the fat grenade.
Good
CONGRATULATIONS.
Congrats on the engagement gab! I love your aesthetic and try to incorporate it in my college dorm 😂💖 I look forwards more episodes love you! 😘
you should  look for the venue first, so your dress can fit the place
I’m
i just want to see their wedding already eeeeeeeeeeee
My wedding dress was the second dress i ever tried on. I left and tried 4 more on. Went back and nothing compared to that second amazing dress snd i got it 🤣🥰
Lol
Omg later can you do an accessory shopping haul????!!!!!!!
Who stands up to get toilet paper
Congratulations with y'all engagement
I’m so excited already, she looks good in all the dresses, and I know that the dress she chose is beautiful so happy for you💗💗
Congrats Gab, so happy for you💖💖💖
I’m so happy for you guys💖
You should totally get a wedding planner to help you organize everything! It’d be so cool to see that
When are you guys posting on. The Niki and gab
Lovely Prayer at the end! 💖🙏🏻
Start looking for your venue now!! While looking set a timeframe for your wedding date. Once you find your venue that works within your timeframe, set your date! Then get your engagement pics taken and order save the date cards using your fave photo from your engagement shoot. Reach out and ask me anything if you want! Congratulations!!!
Hm, what happened with the rebranding? :/
You shouldn’t put on your ring straight away after putting on lotion, or even put lotion on your ring , the lotion  erodes the metal.
was she on say yes to the dress

I love your style now ! It looks more mature and goes so well with your hair 🤩
OMGGGGGG WHHWHEUW VWHAHSBSHEBEJIWHSBWBWISJSJS
Just started planning myself and the best advice I’ve gotten is to start with the budget & guest list then immediately get a venue because your whole wedding revolves around it! CONGRATS BABE!
What dress shop?! Im local and similar taste in style
The first dress I tried on was my dress as well! Congratulations Gabi!!!
im so happy for you guys

JESUS is coming!💙If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead u will be SAVED💙Time is so short!!!!!💙🆓🆓🆓🆓🆓🆓🆓🆓🆓🆓
Everything depends on the season. After a date (or just a season) is picked you can find a venue to match (summer beach, fall farm etc.) then the dress and everything else will come to match
Congratulations gabi!!!
Loveeee u I am so happy for u

Idk about you guys, but I am so happy for her. Gabi is someone who deserves this & so much more. Congrats princess 👸
Your first child NEEDS to be Grace or Grayson. It would be so so special to you.
Omg I love your videos so much and awwwww the perfect couple almost married!!!!!
Omg gabi I love your jeans you looks so good in jeans
I am currently trying to plan a wedding too! I live in Washington and we are still basically shut down due to covid so it makes planning hard and picking a date even harder. We are planning to do an elopement then a big party when things are back to normal. You should get your dress and elope somewhere on the beach!
Hi! Married last year, I planned and did everything myself! My advice is do NOT buy that dress! Try on a million! Have fun w it, try everything, pick your venue, wait a bit and try more dresses. it'll always be there if it really is the one. But Im telling you girl what you want WILL change and you'll have fears that you purchased something too soon without fully trying it all. When can you ever take your time trying on wedding dresses ever again? Also, do NOT sacrifice anything you want for anyone. Be unapologetic and direct with everyone. This is about you!
That was beautifully said 🎀
CONGRATS BABY I LOVE U BOTH
Trendinggg!?
I think y’all should get married and once Covid it is over you can have a ceremony your whole family and friends
Congrats! You’re going to be a beautiful bride 👰🏼

Also CONGRATS! I started watching you around the time you and Collin made your debut on your channel, and it was just a few months after my now husband and I got together. You are going to be such a beautiful bride!!
Congratulations on the engagement 🥳 also love your face mask where do you buy it I need it ❤️💕
I haven't watched you in a year and her you are married! I am so happy for you! Thank you for making my childhood :D
Gabi I got engaged last Christmas and my wedding is in May! I’m so excited to share this experience with you! It’s so beautiful and magical! After being engaged after a year I suggest taking it slow and try to just enjoy the time with Collin!
Congrats 🎊 beautiful gabbi 🤗😍😍
Omg we got engaged on the same day ! My top tip is to create boards on pinterest for planning engagement party, wedding ideas, etc... it’s so useful !! Congratulations love xx
Gabi you are going to rock this wedding.
Congrats👏🏼👏🏼💞
Congrats on the engagement I'm so happy for you !!!❤️
Aww God bless  congrats top youtuber love u
I love how much closer you and Niki have been lately!
The video was sooo good! Thank you Gabi for sharing ❤️
Venue (date) and photographer firsttttttt but its okay you got the dress!
THIS IS THE MOMENT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!!
Congratulations good video
Pick the dress that way you know what kinda style you are wanting to go for because the dress helps with the style and the venue
wedding tik tok
As somebody who literally watched Gabi grow up I’m just so happy for her it’s so incredible to see her be happy and in love with someone great 💗
Do you have any tips on gaining subscribers? I’m struggling over here haha
we need a story time about ur enganment!!!
I would pick a venue and book it as soon as you can. Those venues get booked out so fast and if you’re wanting to do a Saturday like most people it is even more crucial to save your spot. My husband and I went to book our venue the day after we got engaged and the only Saturday available was one year out! And I would be careful getting the dress so soon because you want it to fit perfectly and if you have to wait that long the fitting could get weird. Some venues will provide much more than others so I think that’s a good starting point that way you know where you need to go from there
This is so exciting!!! I'm so happy for you Gabi ❤
You look gorgeous omg
You're so pretty
I'm sure you have a great connection with collen congratulations I can not wait to see the dress♥️😁♥️♥️♥️
I want a bag and purses haul gabi
You just need to do what feels best for you. I got married in August. If you find the dress first you can pick what venue/season matches it. I picked my flowers out before anything.
this is ging to be the best wedding
omfg congrats beautiful, ily both so much 😭🤍
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU AHHH 🙏🏾🙏🏾😇💓😘💖👑👰💍
I remember dress shopping with my mum! Had a perfect dress in mind, chose a completely different style! It took me until my last store to find one, but I love that I got to experience it with my mum... I hope they get to see you in your dress soon!
Congratulations for your engagement ❤️
you tuber Kayla kosuga  is engaged to, she,s planning her own wedding you should totally contact her gabi.
venue and date first
Do not skimp on a photographer or DJ. I also wish I would have did my own hair and makeup I didn’t feel confident in the way I looked. I would also recommend to look around a little bit before deciding on a venue. I was too anxious to just book something and although I loved the place we got married at I found places that I loved a lot better after the fact. Take your time and try not to stress so much! Congratulations!! 💕
Congrats on the engagement
AHHHH IM SO HAPPY FOR UUUU!!!!!
God Bless you both!!!! Congratulations on your engagement!!!!!💙🥺
Thank you for the prayer gabi❤️ I really needed it!
Congratulations! June would be the perfect Month 😉
Downfall to buying the dress early: styles change...things go on sale...body sizes change... some dresses are for certain seasons so the month is important to know. If you buy a year and a half early you might change your mind and it’ll be too late be you’re stuck with it. With that being said... congrats. Love ya
Idky but since they got together I had a feeling they were soulmates and so happy they engaged
Pick a date, and where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayXD2p1uhSs study the bible with these guys!
Was it the ring cleaner?
I’m almost certain I know which wedding dress she fell in love with 🙈
you are so beautiful 💖👸🌇
Download the wedding wire app....I’m currently planning my wedding and it’s been a complete godsend!!!
Congratulations Gabi, your going to make a beautiful bride, Colin is so lucky. I wish you both happiness

Congrats on the engagement Gabi ❤ I actually got engaged on the same day as u 😊

Congrats on the engagement! I’m so happy for you. I did the same thing and found my dress first before I found the venue. I am getting married May 23, 2021. It’s a fun process even though my wedding got postpone already my original date was Dec 5,2020.

Beautiful prayer. In Jesus name Amen 🙏🏾
GABI YOU LOOK SO STUNNING! I cannot wait to see your wedding gown 😍 I am so sorry that you ended up in the hospital from that allergic reaction but I am so happy to see you are doing better now!💕
Why is Gabi the prettiest human❤❤❤❤ Congrats on the engagement 💍 💍 Collin is the luckiest guy in the world!! 🌎
I found my dress before we planned anything else! It was also the first dress i ever tried on :)  Love that prayer thank you for sharing!
Does anyone else think she looks like Nilsa Prowant
I am so happy for you I been waiting for this
I love how she put some pictures in the bathroom so when your bored in there you can look at them😭
You should get the Knot wedding planner it has EVERYTHING! Its amazing. I got mine at Barnes and Noble
Your wedding is going to be actually the best
Congratulations on you’re engagement!🖤
Yes!! I planned my own wedding! Pick your season - if there isn't a specific date that sticks out for you, that's even better - more flexibility is great for finding a venue. Venue is  the most important thing to nail down! Once that's set with your date, everything else follows since you'll know what to put on invitations. Food can be tricky if you're not going with a venue that provides their own catering, but if it does have catering it will make everything pretty easy to plan! Good luck! I'm here if you want more info/help! - I live in SE PA too :)
Congrats luv!! ❤❤❤
Watch Jamie Wolfer!!! She’s a wedding planner and JUST posted a video for newly engaged couples yesterday! I’m not engaged or married, but I watch her all the time
Scope out your venues.  Get the venue to agree to an amenable contract that allows you some flexibility. Create a backup plan. Start booking hair and makeup trials. Start looking at invitations and decor once you have a venue.  Find your bridesmaid dresses.
Loved the prayer at the end 💕
Congratulations princess I hope you get better and your ring is gorgeous 😍❤️
Me: I HATE JEANS I HATE THEM I HATE THEM I HATE THEM I HATE THEM  Gabi: wears jeans Me: “ mouth drops “ Me: I LOVE JEAN I LOVE JEANS I LOVE JEANS I LOVE JEANS I LOVE JEANS  My Mom: I thought you hated jeans  Me: yeah mmm about that .............
Ur trending!
I say go to AUSTRALIA and get married at Bondi Beach! So beautiful and it's hot during our winter months. Check out the show Bondi Rescue and you will see the appeal!

Hey Gabi
Shark attack's r machines Utah tell the worlds
Congrats, firts place, live music if you want, flowers, these practical thinks have a big waiting list. Dress and main collors depends on location, but you can start buying this any time you want.
This happened to my mom I’m wondering what product you used?
I’m so exited that it finally happened We literally waited years for this when Collin said “soon”
Omg this is such an exciting thing!!!!
just cause your doc wasnt in, doesnt mean you should wait it out... mmm im praying you scientifically know when to call 911 or drive your ass to the nearest hospital the moment you know something isnt right... remember orange to the thigh and blue to the sky baby G..
congrats
what month is the wedding?
Congratulations! Yes, get the dress first. It can take time for them to order it and then the alteration time... Also, venue places and restrictions keep changing. So exciting!
Pick your date and venue! Book photographer, videographer, and DJ ASAP. With all the reschedules from 2020 and I'm sure even 2021 brides, venues and companies are already booking!
Gab you should do a story time on when you got engaged! I’d love to hear what happened if you feel you want to share!💖 I’m so beyond happy for you guys 🥺💖
Congrats on the engagement! I’m getting married in June this year and I’m so excited for some wedding content! ☺️🙌🏻
I love the little prayers and Bible things at the end
Venue first! Then main vendors (photographer, florist, dj) then dress!
congratulations on the engagement baby!! i’m so so incredibly happy for you🥺🥺 i love youu
love!! where are those jeans from?! obsessed with your outfit! 🤍🤍
Your hair color looks so good on you and congrats girl 🥰💖
I have a feeling her wedding dress is going to have a big bow on the back!  Love you queen!❤️❤️
I love that your getting married!!!!!!!!!!!! You guys are so very very very cute together!!!!!!❤️
PLEASE SHARE THIS AROUND THE WORLD. I WOULD BE SO GRATEFUL AND IN YOUR DEBT  Link in bio  ❤️💪🏼 https://youtu.be/v68vGYB8HS4
I got engaged the day after thanksgiving ❤️❤️❤️
Awww congratulations on your engagement!!
Why do I feel like she’s getting the Wtoo by Watters Miles Gown from BHLDN. It’s dreamy and romantic while still elegant
😂😂
i am literally so excited
CONGRATULATIONS!!!
my heart is so happy to see your content 🥺
From watching say yes to the dress its good to get the dress fist because then they can get it fitted and make adjustments if need be. Also at the end your makeup looked really good.
I love the prayer at the end! I also know what you are going through im getting married this September. Its definitely magical but so stressful but at the end it makes all the tears and laughter worth it❤️
Book the venue first because the venue offers certain perks and things that you might not have to look for elsewhere. Good luck ❤️ I’m also getting married this year. My wedding was suppose to be in 2020 but u know how that went
Hey girly! I’m getting married early next year and here are some tips I got for you, 1) I PICKED MY DRESS FIRST!!! its so normal to do that! 2) A BIG TIP! Get the app the knot, it helps you plan and has free layouts for wedding websites! 3) get a theme going THEN go look at venues!! Congrats!!
I know what dress you loved 😍😍 my sister works there ( not on that day tho ) and her coworker was telling her about you and the dress, and sent her a Snapchat. I’m so so happy for you 😭😭😭😭

Definitely check out Jamie Wolfer on YouTube! she makes the most helpful and informative wedding planning videos and has been a great resource for me during my own wedding planning process. Also, I know that everything is super up in the air right now with everything that is going on, but it’s honestly really difficult to get going with the planning process without having a date picked out. (Although you definitely can use this time to pick out things like decor, stationary, your dress obviously, bridesmaid dresses, etc.) but you are going to want to have a date sooner than later so that you can book a photographer/videographer + venue. Photographers and venues sometimes are booked for years in advance if they are in high demand.
After talking to our wedding planner, it's best to decide when you want the wedding a choose the venue and wedding ceremony location first. Catering, decor, etc. revolves around that. The dress, although important isn't #1 unless you want a wedding ASAP - sometimes it's better to wait too if your wedding is 1.5-2 years out. I know it is so scary to know when it is right to have the wedding with how unpredictable things are right now, but remember that your wedding is really about you and Colin. Congrats girl! I'm getting married this November so know exactly where you are at mentally!
OMG DOES ANYONE REMMBER THE BRIDE TRIBE FANNY PACK NIKI GOT HER IN A VIDEO SHE CAN USE IT NOW HAHA
I got married 2 month ago. We planned our wedding in a month and half We started by picking a date and we worked aroud that its is impirtint so can book a photagrefer  ,band exc... Then i went dress shopping, i suggest to not buy because it is really expensive for one night
It would be iconic if Gabi was on say yes to the dress omg
Congratulations on your engagement!❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations doll so buzzing for you 💓💓💓
Наступного разу чисти своє колечко, як написано на упаковці, а не своїй руці. Це дуже нерозумно🙄
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE SHOW : SAY YES TO THE DRESS!

I'm sooooooo happy for gab, she deserves this and soo much more
Gabi is going to be the most beautiful bride love u congrats❤❤
The storytime is at @11:00
She went back to fancy vlogs, did I miss something

Congratulations I’m so happy for you!! 🎉
I also got my wedding dressing from BHLDN (pronounced Be-Holden) , it was just such a magical dress. I am sure yours is the same!
Lol scientific it’s medically
Poor thing:(
Congratulations
Here a Bible verse if you ever get overwhelmed while planning wedding Jeremiah 29:11
i think it's totally fine to have dress picked out even if it's 5years early because if u know that that's the one it doesn't metters how much early u will bye it ✨
congrats you deserve the world love you
You are TOTALLY CORRECT regarding Grace..Loved the link to Desiring God..Fun Fact I went to grade school with Pastor John (Piper)’s kids. His son was the reason I started wearing a bra..He told everyone was going to snap it so I HAD TO wear one to school!🤍😂
Gaby FIRST thing pick a date and find the place where you want your party because EVERYONE will want to get married when covid is over even if you pick in 1 year 1/2 atleast its blocked 😘😘😘
So they make you wear a mask on your blown up face ok really
10:50 is where she starts talking about the allergic reaction.

I got engaged during the pandemic (March 21, 2020) and I got my dress in August and am getting married in Boston at this very upscale 5 star hotel and I’m super excited. Congratulation love ❤️ it is such a wonderful feeling🥰
My main tip is just do what is best for you and Collin.
So exciting and ur trendingggg ahh❤️❤️❤️
i have so much beef with prednisone
If I'm having another girl ...I think u might have just named her .   But I did have a snake named grace...but thats okay 👌...not the one in this picture....thats Aava

Listen https://youtu.be/92YqIA5Dp_U
Ur engaged... and so is Ariana 😭😭 I’m sooooo happy for you congratulations 🎉
congrats!!
Yayyyyyy
Dress shopping is fun and we always jump there first . It’s okay! I would say the first official thing should be guest list & count , then the month or season , then the date .
bhldn is pronounced beholden btw!
Me trying to decide how the dress looks behind the blurs: 😐🤔🤔🧐
I’m just saying every yt cupple is getting married
Your hair during the story time is absolutely beeeaauutifulll
I'm watching this to distract myself from my mom being in the icu for covid and that prayer at the end was something I really needed  thank you

Listen to my melodies and your zozl llbehappy🥳👌
Talk about a guest list first so you’ll know what capacity your venue will need! Choose a month you want to get married, then choose a venue!
I was not meaning to pause the video at 2:19 but when I did I died
The first dress I tried on was my winner!!  I was stationed in Japan at the time far away from my family.  I didn’t have any family with me overseas, I wasn’t even looking.  When you know it’s yours then it is.  Good luck, I hope you get the dress you want!!
Use the app the knot. It helped so much

Congrats to you Gabi and Collin.

I recommend using TheKnot.com to find wedding vendors etc. I also used Minted.com to build our wedding website (and invitations) and it came out really well.
Congress
Congrats on getting engaged Gabi! Come check us out for bridesmaid dresses when you're ready... we'd love to dress your girls fo the wedding! x
May I ask when is your wedding?
I’m engaged rn and pick a date first! And it’s totally okay to have your dress, but venues will usually help u w the planning w their team! Super helpful to book one and have that help
Wow #15 on trending and you’re talking about Jesus. He’s using you :) God is calling his children to him one by one. If you believe 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 you can be saved today! He’s returning soon. God bless you

Thank u for that prayer at the end gab❤
Wait for Corona virus to be handled
I sell wedding dresses and the little hints gives it away! It's such a gabi dress! I couldn't have picked anything better!! So happy for you!
You should look at a website called Beautycounter! It is a really good skin care line and make-up line as well. Love you I hope you get well soon.
Omg how are you so prettty?Congratulations 🎈🎉 You are such a princess 👸!!!!!💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💖💖💖💖💖💖💝💝💝💝
You look beautiful Gabi 😍
The hardest part is trying to keep your dress a secret!
I love how there are just engagement photos above the toilet 😂
Make sure you get married in the summer or early fall so it doesn’t rain.
I just got engaged too and am LOVING the wedding vlogs! Definitely recommend setting a date first then look for a venue. Most venders will ask and want to know the date first to check their availability!
Where did you get your mask?!
Does anyone know what stone her engagement ring is?
Beautiful Girl❤️. So inspirational, and kind. I’m so greatful for you and happy for you💖💖
I love you Gab❤️

Wedding planning/preparation vids actually make me so happy! It’s beautiful being able to share in such a life-changing experience.
send out rsvps asap so you can reserve food and such
Gabi  I planned my own wedding using “the knot” and “Zola” apps!! They have a timeline for you to do everything as well as vendors . Your date is the first thing you need to decide! If you need any hep or have questions feel free to reach out on ig or twitter user manifestephany
I've never been more excited about a youtuber getting married... I'm so excited for a magical fancy wedding! sorry about your allergic reaction. I'm sure that was so scary! love u Gab xoxo
Awwww! I love how Niki is sooooo involved!!!
Am sooo happy for you. And hope everything goes wonderful planning your wedding! Blessings 🥰
You will be the most beautiful bride
Gabi, I just wanted you to know how precious I think you are, I'm in my 50s but I love watching you do your thing. You have such a precious heart, and congrads on yall engagement. .you and Collin are so beautiful together, and I can see when you look at each other how much love yall have. Pls always remember the little things in life because it's what makes life grand..your friend in Alabama
As someone currently going through the process, Honestly pick a date first and I know its hard but, when you have an official date you can fully plan everything because everything is surrounded by that date! Its really hard to book things without one because you will find everyone wants to know the date. Also I know regards to the dress I actually have mine to haha 😂 I think its great to get a dress early, and in case this helps my dress was actually the second dress I tried on and I almost didn’t buy it but I kept noticing that every single dress I tried on could not match up with that one I loved. I swear if you are comparing every dress to that one single dress you have found the one!  Love you so much congratulations again
You should watch the wedding planning by Blogilates !! It would help you organize everything 💕 wish you so much happiness you and Collin are soulmates ! Loving the vlogs and messages from god 💝
Congratssssss💕💖💕💕😘
Ask Katie from Jatie vlogs about wedding planing 😆
congratulations!!
If you didn’t wash your new mask, that’s probably what caused it girl
I cannot express the excitement I have for her
OMGGG CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!
You should dye your hair rose gold.💁🏼‍♀️ I think it would be beautiful on your skin tone and everything you wear. 😊👸🏼
I am your biggest fan please fallow me on tick toc and Instagram please comment back
Pick a couple dates, find a venue, then go from there finding your decor and everything.
AT 5:47 GABI ACCIDENTY SAID WHICH ONE IT WAS PLEASE ELT HER SEE THIS SO SHE CAN TAKE IT DOWN
https://youtu.be/0wkQRr365uk
congratulations!!!
It's ironic that Gabi got engaged the same year Ariana got engaged. She looks up to Ariana so much I wonder if Collin made sure to propose the same year Ariana got engaged to make Gabi extra happy
Beautiful is getting handsome 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Is YouTube sure I’m still logged in?
I love you Gabi!
so excited for you!!
So happy for you! The ring is so pretty and princess-esque. Still missing the dark hair or balayage though lol. ❤️
sitting down on my couch while gabi says a prayer just made my day. Gabi pleaseeeeee do that more!
Wow she really get away after what she did,,, wow. Yall do tge most fucked up things then act like nothing happened. And youtube put this on trending
i'm so so happy for you gabi! congratulations!! 🍰🤍🥳
You said yes to the dress but you probably didn't need all that extra stress.   There I go accidentally rapping again. It's a problem..
It was probably the botox
CONGRATS GABI!!!!! FEEL BETTER! LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AN BACK!!!))))
I got married last December. The first thing I did was pick a month to get married, then theme, then the venue and start on decor etc.  I made a Pinterest board on all the things I liked so it was easy to decide.
What product was the reaction from? Do you know? I wanna stay away if possible!
Congrats Princess🥺😍🥰 You’ll be an actual Queen when your married🥺😍😍😍
Congratulations on your engagement 👏 🥳💍👰‍♂️🤵‍♂️🤍

You can get married online if things with covid goto shit. It's called webwed. That's how me and my husband got married and it was such a easy wonderful experience
Hey love! First congratulations! Sending all the positive vibes! I just got married and planned/decorated my own wedding ! First I would recommend set a budget on how much /around you want to spend on your wedding overall. Than think about what season you want to get married in that will determine your colors and dress style ! After that than check out venues ☺️ if there’s anything I can help out with feel free to reach out on IG: _reina_0_  I love helping out others
Congrats! Separate topic: Why not just change the name to Gabi’s Fancy Vlogs?
L
Congrats on engagment queen❤😍
It’s so cute seeing gabby growing up and seeing her get engaged and then in the future maybe we’ll see her have little gabbys and Collins
Omg 🥺🥺💞
Congratulations on the engagement you both make a cute couple
gabi said she would never wear mom jeans but look at her now lol
Talks about title at 10:50
I hope to see the wedding (but I completely understand if you want it private!)
I just got married in October use TheKnot app it is amazing for wedding planning. It helps with timelines and keeping you on track. It also has suggestions for vendors in your area.
So why’d you change your name back and so fast?
You can figure out your decor/theme and starting purchases while you wait to see what 2021 holds!
Yes you girl go gabi I’m so happy for you. So happy that you two are getting married. And congrats 🎉
Yayyy congratulations Gabi!
Congratulations Gabi..!!! 🎊🎊 So happy for you..Love from India..💖💖

Find a venue first and see what days they have available and see what day you want to get married. And then go from there
Book the venue because my sister in law is engaged and the venue she waited was booked until October 2022
loving the blonde hair btw! so pretty
I DIDNT KNOW YOU WERE ENGAGED
Why did you sometimes make it blurry why can’t I see the dress
WHETHER THE CHICKEN FIRST APPEARED OR THE EGG???

Hi Gabi! I also just got engaged and I am super overwhelmed with planning. I would love to know what tools or resources you are using to plan your wedding.
Maybe try a wedding planning app like the knot it could be very helpful in assisting you in every single step you need to take to plan your wedding
Congratulations 🎉  beautiful 😍 ❤️
Is niki bi or lesbuan .
I love you Gabi! Congratulations on your engagement!!💞💞
All skincare and beauty products can give an allergic reaction, that’s why in the back it always says to put a small amount on your face first when trying for the first time.
Congratulations! My best advice as a former bride is to use a wedding planner! They have so many connections in the industry to make your dream wedding a reality, and especially during COVID!
Hire a wedding a planner.I was married 2 years ago and its the best thing I did .She helped make my vision come to life and made everything so much less stressful
Omg I’ve watched niki and Gabi since like 2014 and to see gabi engaged is so wholesome 🥺🥺
90's mom jeans are so hot right now..

You are engaged at the same time as Ariana 😘😂
Thank you for sharing the prayer and the grace video 💚 I hope you have a blessed wedding lovely ☺️💚
That prayer you read to us was so beautiful and I hope that we can all walk in that truth, God bless you Gabby and you’re  gorgeous inside and out! 😇❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for the prayer, I didn’t know how much I needed that till I heard it, god bless🥺❤️
Congrats girl on the engagement u could always ask ur mom for opinions or ur friend for engagement opinions and take some notes it might help!
Jesus Christ loves you all so much. Come to him today! He's coming very soon! Accept him as your Lord and Savior. Jesus died on the cross 2020 years ago so that we may be free from our sins through him. Believe on him and Trust him! He is our peace in these troubling times. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
the way i’ve been watching you since 2014, and now you’re getting married...🥺
The plain dress was bomb
come to Paris to celebrate it !! ❤️❤️❤️
Dang all y’all hated her and now you’re back to loving her hmm
omg your changed your name back too fancy vlogs by gabi yes 💞 congratulations on your engagement!
As a fellow Believer, I just wanted to thank you for the beautiful prayer reading. It was encouraging and quite inspiring, I truly appreciated it. 💚💚💚
I thought she just got more botched botox
Pick a date first and then book your venue ASAP and see if they have your date available! Couples book their venue up to a year in advance. I used to work in the wedding industry and venues are usually the top main priority when planning a wedding. Congrats gabi and happy planning! :)
I planned my own wedding! The best advice I can give to you is to just take it one task at a time. If you look at the whole picture it can get very overwhelming very quickly, but hey! You may already have your dress! That’s exciting!✨  I’d also say next you should tackle the date and venue.  I’m also a wedding photographer, so once you have a time and place be sure to go after any vendors you really love because, wedding vendors book up fast! Especially with so many brides having to postpone/reschedule from everything going on.  Hopefully that was helpful! Haha Happy wedding planning!
Avenue    U   22ST BR0OkLN丫  https://www.bilibili.com/read/mobile/2068641
I’m excited to see the wedding dress that you picked out when mom and sister come with you
❤️Congratulations❤️I wish you the best luck.
Congrats! Wish you the best!🌷❤
Omg omg congrats on your Engagement!!❤️💕
Congrats gabi ! LOVE YOU.
Im crying watching the vlog...
Start with Pinterest wedding checklist, they gave me a good out line but remember to customize it to what makes you happy. Like I got my dress first thing and others wait. The outlines are good but you have to remember what makes you happy!!
I think you should not buy your dress this early.....you said you will marry after 1-1.5 years.... May be your mindset will change in that time...your body... Anything and everything can chenge in this much time.... You should take your dress 4-5 months before wedding for sure ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congrats  on the engagement princess! 💐
Husband and I had a destination wedding in Hawaii (where he’s from) and I’d say choose your dress depending solely on how much you love it! To me, it doesn’t matter the location as much. A ball gown on the beach? Why not!
hey, Gabi, I love your wedding dress and you are going to be like a fairtale princess love you xxx
I’m getting married on May 15th 2021! I picked out the venue first because i knew that was more important to me then the date
OMG Gabi, i have been watching niki and gabi since yall did your high school morning routines, My queen u deserve so so much, i pray for your happiness everyday boo, ur such an inspo for girls all round the world. xoxo - ur fan from London.
Elope, plan a reception when you can celebrate your marriage when the law allows.
If that’s the dress for her, that’s sooo crazy that it was the first one she tried on
So happy for you both ❤️ wish you all the best
I have suffered from severe allergies and it stinks. So sorry you went through that. You also have been through so much nutritionally. I hope you take the viome test so you wont have to find out about these allergies in an ER 💖❤️💖❤️
It helped me so much having a book with each guests address, any dietary restrictions, their dinner choice, and if they’ve rsvp/declined. And I left space under each persons name to write their gift which helped so much with thank yous!!
Gabi you should highly consider hiring a wedding planner! They will help you so so much and help you get the best venue and make your dreams literally come true. Like a fairy godmother😉💕
Gabi... 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍 im dreaming!
if you have a daughter in the future... you should name her Grace🥰💕✨
I am BEYOND happy for you. 💗
she said she wanted to be a princess  when she grew up and she stuck to it!
Yes, you need a few ring holders around the house (kitchen/bathroom) to protect the metal and the setting. You will be pro at cleaning it 😂
GUYS! WHEN SHE GETS MARRIED SHES GRADUATING FROM A PRINCESS TO A QUEEN 😭😭💜💜👑👑
I swear she looked GORGEOUS in every dress she tried on
I ended up picking out the 1st dress I tried on, too. 16 yrs ago 😆
Never to early to get your dress darling, find a venue early so you know for sure you have one, find your band so you know you have music and make sure to talk to the person you want to perform y’all’s vows most the time they are booked. Can not wait to see your wedding ☺️ I’ve been following you since your high school days 🥰
Hey gabi if you want a castle looking venue near by there is a community center in Lawton Michigan that give HUGE castle vibes and my mom is the director so I can see what I can help you with if you need
Yay she’s back to fancy vlogs by gab!!
I think Gabi made a mistake Colin maybe saw this video and saw Gabis dress
gabi i am literally so excited for you omg !
Gabi is going to be the prettiest bride ever❤️❤️
A year and a half is good, I gave myself a year to plan and it goes by so fast!! Shopping for a dress now is fine as well. I think it just depends on what matters more to you, if you have a venue in mind already you can work with their available dates. It seems like dates get snagged fast, but with the current circumstances there may be more availability?
Ilysm gabi I pray that u will be blessed with an amazing marriage
Girl I’m planning mine right now and the best advice I can give is PICK THE DATE FIRST lol and then the venue you want so the dates line up, go for a venue that can do as most as they can, meaning, they cater, decorate, etc.. and as for the dress you’re not too early, I picked mine early too because I need it altered and just for it to come in to the boutique takes about 5-6 months not including the time it’ll take for it to get altered after. Enjoy planning! It’s stressful but so special as well 💕💍
The royal wedding we all needed! 🙌🏼🤍
It’s her Wedding she will plan it how she wants can we just be happy for her for once ? I know I am go Gabi ❤️
I’m so happy for you!
I really like when you read for us Gabi, I think that, christian or not, everyone can feel comfort in those words.
OML more excited than I would ever be for my own wedding 🤍
Nice nails ❤️❤️☺️☺️
Find a venue and then pick a date with the venue to ensure the venue will be open. You want the venue first so you know all your other choices look good in that setting and you will have a place to send the the vendors you book.
Congrats on the engagement princess! 🎀
Someone please answer!! Which ipad does Gabi have??
You should start making your guest list depending on how big or small that is, then you can check out venues. Once you chose a venue and a date, you can make your invitations because you’ll have the address on it. Also start looking at decor ideas! Making things, ordering things, etc. that process takes a while. Find decor for a “photo with the Mr. and Mrs.” backdrop look at cakes! You got this girl we are here for you 🥂✨🤍
I’m not saying they are copying each other, BUT HOW DID GABI AND ARIANAS ENGAGEMENT GET SO CLOSE!!!???
I'm so happy for you two
Can someone believe she got engaged bc I can’t I’m so happy for her 😃
I just realized she’s engaged at the same time as Ariana 💗
Check out Jamie Wolfer on Youtube. She is a wedding planner and has the BEST wedding planning content anywhere on the internet! You wont regret it.
Hey
You’re going to have the best wedding ever. I just know it.  Glad you’re feeling better. ✨💗
Got engaged myself during my birthday in October. Haven't started anything, but would like to wish you all the best for your wedding and future. Congratulations from Ireland to both you and Colin.
Am I the only one that never heard about karly being a best friend or heard about her at all since nikkis video?
OMG
Omg your allergic reaction literally was like the shellfish one in Hitched! So happy your feeling better! My skin is so sensitive too! I try using as many natural products as possible 🥰
she’s going to have the most perfect wedding ever, it’s literally going to be a real life fairytale 💖
Gabi, do things in this order: 1. Book venue 2. Book the Photographer and band or DJ 3. Book the caterer (six months in advance) 4. Choose your bridal party 5. Buy your wedding gown (and order bridal party gowns or give them a color scheme so they can choose their own gowns) 6. Book florist (5 months in advance) 7. Book wedding cake 8. Guest list (choose whether or not you're going to send them through the regular mail, with the pandemic you can just send virtual invites) 9. Plan rehearsal dinner 10. Plan your honeymoon 11. Register for gifts 12. Send out invitations (2 months in advance) 13. Book hairdresser and makeup 14. Final dress fitting 15. Final guest count (1 month in advance) 16. Get your marriage license 17. Pick music for your wedding playlist 18. Cut and color your hair (two weeks in advance) 19. Pack for your big day and for honeymoon 20. Manicure and pedicure (Max two days before wedding day)  This list does not include Groom's and groomsmen attire or bridal shower because that does not depend on you that much....
Collin is always so pleasant
I got engaged the same day as you :) I’m so excited for you and Colin
Too early to start lol if you still wanna wait a year and a half it’s way too early for a dress
You should find the venue before the dress. That changes how the dress should be 😊
Simplynailogical had the same reaction .. maybe you could ask her
i just love bridal vlogs🥰
I love the second cinderella dress...u would wear it to prom
I think you should pick the date, then see venues, then see what themes you want, decoration, guest list, band you want to book or dj, flowers bridesmaids dresses.. there is a lot. Invites, lettering, food..
I couldn't be happier for you Gab. I know how amazing Collin is and you guys are going to live happily ever after. Best wishes to you and collin as you start your journey and I hope you have an amazing year. 💖💖💖
I just got married in July. I planned everything alone, we picked the date first, location, dress, then decor & shit. We also waited 2 years after engagement.
Thanks gabi for the “Grace” podcast and reading that bible devotion. I’ve enjoyed seeing all the content relating to the bible/ and God. Thankyou once again and Congratulations on getting engaged and all the wedding planning 😘🥰😄
Maybe hire a wedding planner to help planning go by smoother. I’m so happy for you this is so exciting😆
YESS PLEASE KEEP READING THESE VERSES/PRAYERS!! Please😭❤️
You can pick your dress as soon as you want! Definitely pick the date ASAP and book the venue because most venues need a year in advance, especially with rescheduled weddings from this year. Get the date, book the venue and go from there. Also make sure you check if the venue has their own catering or you have to hire your own. Congrats!!
your wedding should be like spring themed and very fairytale moment and you should have it like right before or after Easter in the Spring I feel like that's so you!!
I legit cried when I saw she was engaged because I have been waiting for this to happen for so long
“I feel like i’m marrying a prince 🤴🏼” BITCH YOU ARE!!
I use bridal book it has literally helped me figure out the steps and what to do first in the planning process. Congratulations girl I’m so happy for y’all 💕
I found my venue first then got catering scheduled. The dress was last.
Venue, photographer, and DJ are most important! But you must choose a date first
a coincidence that you are getting married around the same time as Ari? Lol, I love you <3
oml i’m so freaking happy for you!!! love you!!
Bride Tips: Look for a venue first and then set the date. All vendors will then be scheduled so easily once you get those two things set! 🤍
Hi! I'm a fashion youtuber who just started yesterday! Id love if you could check out my recent video that would be amazing! Have a great day! 💕
Photographer and venue first! They book up the fastest. I just got married in October (Covid wedding woohoo) and those 2 things should be first. Caterer is a close third.
I love you gabi x And your so beautiful and powerful I look up to you x
Love the prayer at the end xx
I got married on December 20, 2020 so I'm living for the upcoming wedding content! Pick a date first then plan around that. (Keeping in mind that adjustments may have to be made due to the pandemic.) Depending on the date/season you'll have a guide for picking a venue, bridesmaids dresses, decor, ect. I knew I wanted a Christmas wedding and picked a long sleeve dress, my ceremony was an old 1930s chapel and my venue was about 7 minutes away.
love you Gabi, lowkey wanna be a bride rn lol altho i'm just 20
ahhhhh I’m so happy for you gabi!!! the entire wedding is gonna look amazing and thank you for taking us on your journey! ❤️
Where’s your gold mask from ???
Congratulations I’m sooo happy for youuuu❤️❤️
The prayer 💖 I tear up every time. I'm so happy for you Gabi 🤍🥂
Girl you need Zola literally saved my life planning my own wedding. Everything is done in one app it’s amazing!
I'm confused
The venue will spark ideas and get it rolling...def pick a venue. ✨🤍  Knowing the date will let you  know who can cater on that date, who can do photos on that date, and so on. 💕
You look so gorgeous! I think that you look very pretty when your more simple. Ps I love youuuuuuuu
Getting a good photographer is one the MOST IMPORTANT THING you need to focus on BECAUSEEE YOUR WHOLE DAY WILL DEPEND AND RUN WITH UR PHOTOGRAPHER AND ITS SOMEGHING THAT YOU WILL WNAT TO LOOK BACK AT IN YEARS TO COME.
ofc she get engaged the same time as ariana 🙄
i'm sorry to say that but i fink that your moll to marry . [and i love you i'm a bid fun .]
are u filming the wedding
hi gabi i watch your video all day  and it makes me feel happy 😚
Gabi is going to be such a beautiful bride
My mom had an extreme allergic reaction to avocados.  She had always eaten then before, but this one time she ended up with puffy, red eyes, itchiness, etc. Benadryl saved her life. It’s why I always make sure she is carrying it and I am carrying it. Just over a week ago I got extremely itchy and my back was burning and breaking out in hives. I took Benadryl and immediately it calmed down. Like that never has happened to me.
gab, im not a bride at all but i 100% think your doing the right thing by looking for the dress and other things before the date and venue bc ur not growing or changing style so i think your doing this so so well! <3
Download “the knot” that app was a life saver. Between tips, organizing, budgeting, it helped me keep on track. Bridal magazines also helped me, too. I was a calm bride because I had everything done earlier in advance
I’m so excited for gabi
Download or buy a wedding planner which lists everything with its timeline, dos and donts, less stress to hire a wedding planner, you will enjoy your much  wedding better
venue first then date i feel like the dress so early only doesn’t matter if your weight doesn’t fluctuate
I would pick the date and the venue first, but make sure that you order the dress at least 6 months before the wedding!
“Worldly circumstances”-Gabi
You look beautiful in a wedding dress Gabi! I’m so happy for you and Collin Congratulations 🎉🍾
not surprising you found a dress so quick they usually say not to try more than like 5 dresses
Choose a date so that you can see what dates the venues you like have available. Congrats girls
Cristine (simplynailogical) also had something like that allergic reaction
Definitely find a venue and pick a date. I used to work at a place that does weddings and sometimes the venue you may really want, may not have an opening the for specific date you want until a couple years down the line
I am so excited for her dress and i am really happy for you both love you so much🥺🥺🥺❤❤❤❤
Look for the dress first because if you need to do any changes to it you can make them in advance for your wedding 👰 🎩 I am so happy for you and excited for you . Leave the date for the wedding until covid is done and over with 💜💜💜💜💜💜
I love bride vlogs
I bought the first dress I tried on the first place I went. And my husband picked it out and saw it on me lol.
not me seeing seeing gabi in jeans for like the first time😭
i’m not a hater but how comes you changed your channel name back to “fancy vlogs” ? x
Your rebrand lasted long 😂
Your striped rode in the first clip is so cuteee where’s it from ? Love your videos God bless💕
Pick a MONTH then see what dates are available at your venue within that month. The available date that speaks to you is the one ♥️
Married girl here! Start looking at venues for sure! We ended up getting married in the woods by a river and I wouldn’t change it for the world. Also the reception venue if it isn’t a 2 in 1 location. Take care Gabi!
Are her and Ally still friends?
Gabi I'm so happy for you and Collin also I hope you are feeling better and can go get your dress with Niki and your mom soon without any stress and/or difficultys!!!💖💜 love you forever and always!
The suspense is killing me, I would love to see what the dress looks like
The wedding planning will b stressful and crazy but try to take ur time and soak it in also I would suggest look For a venue first venues book up like crazy so do hair n makeup artist but try to find a date so u can plan for it!
Her and Ariana both engaged LOL
So exciting! Congrats on your engagement!
Venue and date first! Then colors/theme/decor. Guest list.
Girl same I litterally went first day dress shopping tried the first dress on n it was it!
omgggg the wedding will probably look like a storybook and i know it will be epiiccccc💖 ur a queen 💖
Gabi I'm so excited for you and Colin! Congratulations Gabi and Colin! Love you both!
Congrats again gabi! I know the wedding will be absolutely elegant  !
Pick a venue first! That made everything so much easier for me.
She would look so good with dark hair on her wedding day
My sister is getting married and she got this app that tells her when to organise things. I think you should start by finding the place especially with everything going on it's gonna be more difficult
Congrats on your engagement!!!! The best advice I have is do you wedding your way and have fun with it girl!!!! Breath and know everything will be fine!!!! Happy New Year and ty so much for that prayer at the end!!!! Trish
Loved the prayer! & I’m so excited and happy for y’all!❤️
I got married and planned a wedding for 300+ guest all on my own. Look fist for a location/venue and then set a date  Curch?  I had a place where they offered food and drinks But if yours does not search for catering  dress  someone to decorate and for the lights Music: Lifeband or DJ?  Photography  Hair & Makeup artist if needed Weddingcake Flower arrangement for the venue and for your bouquet  Jewelry? Hairpiece: flower crown, tiara, vail ect   And plan how you want your wedding to be. Like set time from when to when. For example when the ceremony starts, when you will have your first dance (time) and which song they should play, when you are going to throw the bouquet.  Will there be any games?  Even when you are going to cut the cake and maybe which song when the cake arrives ect
as a married woman I can tell you one thing, start looking for places to have the wedding, the dress and have everything prepared, then, when you are sure, get a date and send invites!!
Gabis wedding will be goals 🥺❤️❣️
step 1 - find your exact vision! size, vibe, everything. step 2 - book ALL YOUR VENDORS. step 3 - details :) dresses, decor, etc.
Hey Gab!! I’m a wedding/party planner and can send you some tips and timelines for your wedding and how to go about your wedding process. Congrats on the engagement!!  My email is icedteauhhh@gmail.com
Hope you get better soon Gabi x and congratulations 🎉 so happy for you 😘x
hey gabi if u feelin a mess or lost bout ur wedding just try to cald down everything gonna be alright 🤍 p.s here's a few movies u can watch bride wars , monster in law & the weeding planner. xoxo
You are really beautiful
You guys are so beautiful to gother
Omg I ate lobster on Friday and I got the same allergic on Friday so we were both in the hospital on Friday
CONGRATULATIONS GABI https://youtu.be/RcxB_P75VUc
Gabi and Ariana announced their engagement in like the same week!
so happy for you!! and omg, so sad that you got an allergic reaction..
Your hair in this whole video is everything!!! So happy for you Gabi!!!!
Pick your venue first and caterers
So happpy for you 💕
Make a story board it’ll keep you organized
Watch the movie the wedding planner with JLo it’s so good
I feel like this is going to be such a fairytale wedding
I love you Gabriella Vogt❤❤❤
I wish i had a pure friend like gabi❤
I love you. Hope you feel better<3
I actually felt really sad for Niki and her mom not being there for the wedding dress appointment...my mom would have been heartbroken if she couldn’t go with me when i got my dress
I picked my venue first then I got my  dress
Comgrats Gabi!!!! This is suchhh a dream come true for all fancybabies. You deserve a prince because you are a princess❤❤
I never thought we get this detail so fast 😍
Niki has been in contact with someone with COVID... and you want to get her and your Mum to come over, but you have friends over... so Nate might get infected, and niki, and you, and Colin, and your friends, and their family, your mum, your dad, people at home with them, everyone’s pets, and then the people at the dress shop, this is DANGEROUS
I planned everything myself! You can definitely do the dress first, that is actually very common to do for many brides.   After the dress, everything else really hinges on having a date set. The main thing to consider when setting a date is the main venue (or venues). Before choosing a venue, have your rough guest count (ie, 50, 150, 500? How many guests do you envision?) And then when scouting venues, especially during this current global client, ask their cancelation policies, refund policies, and backup plans they have should regulations change.  Make sure once you have selected a venue before signing any contracts that they include a cancelation clause so that you can get a refund if you have to cancel due to global circumstances beyond your control.
Congratulations 🥳
I love these prayers you do in every vlog recently❤️🙏 sending love gabs and congratulations ✨❤️
Girrrrlll you soo pretty
I would recommend you finding a venue and a wedding date first, also would recommend you getting the Bridebook app😊 it is so helpful!  Love from Norway💕
I can see her having her wedding at a place like the legacy castle in jersey
since Gabi found God again she's just glowing <3 and she's her true self!! i love this Gabi!! <3
it’s gonna be exactly like a princess fairytale wedding! 💖💝
she has like 20 „best friends“
During covid do not choose a date first as circumstances constantly changes, my sister was a covid bride and she had to change the dates and venues SEVERAL times so take things slowly and hopefully next year or the year after will be the one !! ❤️
Ur allergic reaction face doesn't look to different from ur normal face 🤣
Do tf do ppl still support u knowing what u did 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬
Fancy vlogs by gab again? Hmmm
idk if its just me but this hair color is perfect for Gabi🤩 she looks so good
Nobody gives a shit
I just planned our wedding and start with venue first and get a general month you want to be married in. Then start working on the vibe or theme you want. And then go with the food. After that it’s all the fun decorations
You look so beautiful! Even after the allergic reaction, you’re glowing 💕
Congrats !!!! But hold up you said your future sister in law is married to Collins older brother ...... That means siblings married ??? I'm confused  1:05
on the 6:30 photo she literally looked like trisha lmao
Gaby I’m so happy for you
God has a pen gabi has a highlighter god made the world gabi makes it brighter
Ahhh the same thing happened to my mum, her best friend since kindergarten then later became her sister-in-law!
gabi looks like such a angel with blonde hair
Hey, I'm in the same process that you are ! The first thing I did was picking the date because we are getting married on are 5th year anniversary !  Planning à wedding is not easy you have to do what seems write for you ! Since you want to get married in more than a year everything will be ok ! If I have just a little advice look for location, choose one and then see when they are available and you choose a date ! Congratulations and enjoy 😊
I loved that prayer 💖
you should pick a date first!
Are gabi and Allie still friends?
Congratulations!!!!! So excited for you!!
She’s literally glowing 🥰 I’m so happy for you gab! 🖤
Yes it's ok to look for the dress first. I found mine right away also. I book the venue first. Then did all the other scheduling after that. I also suggest looking for the bridesmaids dresses after u get ur dress. I hope this advice helps. I got married 2018 :)
GABI I AM SO HAPPY FOR U RIGHT NOW I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU AND NIKI SINCE U DID THE PRETTY LITTLE LIARS EPISODES
Go follow Jamie Wolfer. She is a wedding planner and her yt channel talks about everything weddingplanning related. She is lovely
Loved the prayer 🙏
OMG the intro was so folklore
I loved planning my wedding, and the dress was actually the first thing I bought 😍 I would start with setting the date and booking the place for the wedding! After that I'd decide on the "theme colors" etc so you can pick out matching invitations, decorations, cake and so on 😊
Gabi ! You need to get married in Greece where mama mia was filmed ❤😭😭😭😭😭
Hey
Can you PLEASE share the wedding planning process and any tips and what apps you use? Very happy for you and Colin and literally cannot wait to see you be the most beautiful bride🥺💗💗
I'm so happy that you're engaged 🥰😍💍⭐✨
hey Gabi, congrats to you both! you look like you’re glowing! i think one big thing could be the ring polish. i’m so sorry that happened!!
My name means Grace💖
so happy for you! my boyfriend proposed to me on new years eve, and I screamed when I saw that you are engaged too!!! I feel so lucky because you will give me som much inspiration for my own wedding eeek
I love how she decided to wait for her mom and Niki with the dress😭
Gabi u look soooo prettyyy and magical
Pick the dress now and flowers and Mach every thing else
I'm so glad you got better ❤️
Her wedding is going to be a real fairytail!💗
This nex Courler hairs is giveing 2017 vibes
The plant in the glass just gives me beauty and the beast vibes and i love u sooooooooooooooo much and i am obsessed with your makeup at the end
Are you having natural colour hair for your wedding
Awww
You rock girl!
my middle name is grace I love you gano been watching since 00remakegirls congrats on your   Proposal I love you and may 2021 be the best for you❤️
bro she is so fucking beauitful
I'm so happy  for gabi and COLLIN like I hope their wedding is like a fairy tale💗💗
I saw my dress on my dress designers instagram, went to her studio, tried it on and bought it. Was love at first sight for sure!
Def start with the venue! Those are the most difficult to get, from experience. Everything else can be easier planned/scheduled/arranged. This is the one that will probably stay fixed, so make sure you have it locked.
I waited for these bridal vlogs so long! I am so happy about Gabi!
Plss vlog your wedding it's gonna be magical I bet ❤️
💖🥺✨
Did I just hear that she's having a beach wedding??
You should go to Bermuda or Paris for your honeymoon!!
My mother had the same allergic reaction when she used hair dye(she never knew she was allergic to it) her eyes swelled up and her head as well  ...such a scary moment
Hold on, I think I missed something here. How come the channel is called fancy vlogs by gab again? It changed and now it has changed back...
Its gonna look like a fairy tale for sure💜
I think the flower in a glass is called a terrium? 🤍
I would have my wedding in the woods
I think you should fix the date first ❤
I had an allergy attack on new years eve and I couldn't breathe thru my mouth so I had to go to the doctors!
I have seen you grow up since 2017 n today watching you trying wedding dress feels amazing 🤗 I think you should get married on 14 feb it would ne iconic 😊😊💞
Am I the only one that noticed she changed her name back to fancy vlogs by gab 😂😂 that was sure quick...
I got married in October 2020 and planned my whole wedding, but had to replan at short notice to go in line with the Scottish COVID guidelines.  Deffo pick the date first, because you’ll get asked by so many suppliers what your date is as they’ll need to check if they’re already booked or not. Then move onto suppliers then. Hope this is a bit helpful ☺️ x
That’s so cute and meaningful because my middle name is (grace)🥺🥺
am i the only one who cried when i saw her in those beautiful wedding dresses? it feels like a dream. i am so happy for you Gab 🤍
mate it went from fancy vlogs by gab to gabi vlogs and AGAIN BACK TO fancy vlogs by gab are u okay sis?
im so happy that you have been feeling better, i love u <3
Does anyone know what lipsticks she has on?
I thought you renamed your channel to gabi vlogs
I’m so happy for you 🤍
Omg Your Already looking for dresses!! Like how soon is the wedding like is it tomorrow!!!!
Hi. My mum got married and she booked the venue then dress then decor.
I have always imagined Gabi in a long sleeve gown. I think that’s what she’s gonna do.😁
did you buy the jimmy choo princess shoes that you said you wanted for your wedding in a vlog way back x?
Gabi is so beautiful ❤️the wedding is going to be gorgeous I know it
i NEED that story time
Are you planning on having kids?
Please make a wedding vlog
I feel in love whit the first dress I try for my wedding
An important thing is to figure out your theme and then everything you do for the wedding should be a bit about that theme
I got engaged the day after Thanksgiving! So special. I would say make booking your venue your first priority. Everyone who postponed their wedding last year is getting married this year so dates could be limited. So keep your "date" flexible. Also, installing a wedding planning app like "The Knot" is suuuper helpful. It basically tells you exactly what you need to do in the order you should do it. Congrats! <3
She may not show us the dress right now but atleast we know its a white dress with full sleeves
She gonna make a cinderella wedding :)
Omg gabi??? In jeans?????😍
Yes, keep praising the Lord, Gabi! ✝️❤️❤️❤️
does anyone know where her headband at the end is from?
After watching her for years and now she’s getting married😭😭😔😔 Dear Collin  YOU BETTER MAKE GABI HAPPY FOREVER ♾. Dear GABI  YOU BETTER HAVE AN AMAZING LIFE WITH YOUR DREAM MAN FOREVER ♾. Dear Gabi & Collin Voge  Be together dearly have a blast, grown together and love each other.  Dear Mother Nature & The Lord  Make sure the weather is amazing with rainbows 🌈 ✨✨✨
I know they are only engaged but they are going to be amazing parents
omg.. so glad you’re okay.. 🙏🏻✨
Congrats gabi By Bloom
I’m currently engaged and I’m honestly just going to hire a wedding planner 😂
Omg that happened to me it was a product I bought and my face got so swollen and I was so scared
Do you know what caused the reaction? I have the same fear!!!! So glad you are okay! You look amazing 💕
Omg  Gab that exact thing happened to me in may it was awful and so scary. I’m glad you’re ok. Love you
The first dress I tried on was the one I fell in love with too.
I know her wedding is going to be a fairy tale
Your allegies might have been caused by aloe vera because I’ve had a similar reaction multiple times and it was aloe vera so maybe check that ?
There better be a Cinderella carriage if not I’m going to literally buy one😭 I grew up watching you guys so I feel like my own sister is getting married
I have the same allergic reaction and it’s so annoying even right now my eyes are swollen ☹️
should see a specialist and bring what you tried on your face to see for sure. that's messed up. it's good to know what ingredients for future reference. glad you're ok.
I also got engaged last year November... Already have a date and venue and theme ... I am so nervous about wedding dress shopping... I am very curvy so scared I'll look ugly
For sure a beach themed wedding
Talking about the universe is new age stuff, which is not Christian.
I've been married for 3 years now. Most things should wait until after you pick a venue
I found my wedding dress while browsing for  my engagement party dress. It was the first dress I tried on and the last
thank you for spreading God's word recently♡
I was soo happy when i saw the proposal video i was crying even. You guys are the cutest God bless you ❤❤
YASSS FANCY VLOGS BY GAB IS BACK WE LOVE YOU GABI <3

Congrats!
HIRE A WEDDING PLANNER!!!!!!!!
So glad you’re back to fancy vlogs by Gabi, congrats on your engagement 🎉
Gabi you have grown up so much and I aam so happy for you!! :)
Everytime I’m at hobby lobby there bridal section is having a sale. It might be worth a shot to check it out if there is a hobby lobby near you :))
Venue first. Then everything else can fall in line :) flowers. Favors. Rentals
I planned my entire wedding!! I can help! I love to do these things!
Gabi’s wedding is gonna look like a fairytale and i love it 🤍✨
Really love how you have been sharing your faith in your vlogs lately 💕
atleast ik her dress is gonna be white
I think a cream one would look nice on you. With your glowy tan, hair color and Gold makeup. 🔥🔥🔥
Still waiting on the beautiful mess album
Omgggg Gabi I’m happy for u !!!!!!!
you’re wedding will be just like a FAIRYTALE📖💍💘
Omg Gavin I got married in October !!!! And I GET  HOW STRESSFUL IT IS! I had a backyard wedding! My tip: the actual wedding day... just be excited snd not “it has to be perfect” mode. Cause it takes away from the day. Lmk if you need anything !!!!
I'm so happy for you two  💖 💖 💖
It’s crazy how I’ve watched you since I was in middle school and now you’re getting married. So happy for you!!🥺🥺
gabi definitely has a pinterest board for her wedding
Omg I’m so excited to see the dress!!!!
as a fellow future bride who has been planning through covid, find your venue and date first. specifically for your venue, since MANY couples in 2020 had to reschedule into 2021 and 2022
Worldly circumstances girl you mean the pandemic it’s a pandemic
I can tell how excited you are. I’m so happy for you two.
Pictures in the RR?!
1. Dress  2. Venue/ colors/ theme 3. Date/ invitations  Once you have a venue and date then you can start to book everything else: Photographer/videographer. Food/ caterer/ dessert options ( if not provided by the venue). Florist etc.
Aww I love how you’re sharing about God🥰🤎 Using your influence for the good 🙌🏼 Love you Gabi and Congratulations again🤍
Figure out which season you wanna get married in. Since you said you wanted a beach wedding start looking up locations online. And finalise on a few places you go look at once the situation let’s you.  Once your date and location are finalised select your flowers, cake, invite and decor. You can finalise the guest list now too.
Get a wedding planner
I say wait cause this year the same pandemic rules will apply the entire year again.
so beautiful I'm so excited for you! also, please tell us what product made you swell like that so I can stay away from it! glad you're okay <3
you should have your wedding with ariana🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
So happy for you boo! There are Wedding Planning Apps that you can download that will help step by step.
Pick the date first and  venue then look for some inspiration in Pinterest    then find your color pallet so you now the colors then do your wedding gown and brides maid gown then do the shopping 💕
Everyone's your best friend lol haha glasses really suit you.  Why didn't they tell you what caused the allergic reaction?
I feel like Niki is going to have a black wedding dress on her wedding if she ever gets married
I had 6 people with me in Pa three months ago.
Girl where did you get that pink kimono with the sequin bow 🥺 it’s beautiful!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just want to say it’s beautiful for you to have friends who do this for you as a pick you up’ keep those friends close! 💕 And congratulations on the engagement!
WAIT SO ARIANA AND GABI GOR ENGAGED AROUND THE SAME TIME AHHH
I love the prayer ending so much.😊💛
Loved the prayer at the end!!! 😘

Hi gabi love your hair
The new introoooo
Imagine Gabi and Collin having a rennesance wedding 😍😍😍
Congrats on your engagement
I am just so beyond happy for them ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Awww Gabi I’m sorry you had an allergic reaction :(  I love you so much
Collin casually watching netflix in the background 😆
IM SO HAPOY FOR YOU I LOVE YOU
imagine her and ariana getting married at the same time aaaaaaa
Dress in most cases needs to be first, it usually takes 6-8 months for the dress to come in and then you still have to do the alterations. Make sure when you do your alterations you wear your shoes and bra (if you need one) because then it can be altered perfectly to fit with them. Venue next it helps finalise the date. Biggest expenses are generally dress, venue and catering and be 100% clear with what you want from the beginning.
I picked the very first dress I tried on too 💕 so happy for you Gabi!!!!
Girlll you're wedding is gonna be SO perfect😍😍😍 love you so much gabi!!
Her wedding video is going to be like a live action princess movie
I planned my own wedding almost 4 years ago. My husband and I got married on Valentine’s Day and had a small wedding with about 25 close family members. I think it’s okay that you’re picking out your dress first, especially given the circumstances in the world today. Next I would think about picking a date and then a venue. After that if you picked out a theme for your wedding you can start looking at decorations like centerpieces, table clothes, flowers, cake testing, catering, and all that other fun stuff. It can be a little overwhelming at times, but it’s definitely a fun and memorable experience... enjoy it, Gabi, and congratulations again! 💕💕💕
her wedding is going to be a fairytale 🥺🤍
I’m so happy for you and I hope you have a great wedding. Also tour mask is amazing and so sparkly. Have a great day Gabi!!
Find the rings you’d be exchanging vows with!😍 create a theme already & like choose flowers/design you’d want it would help a lot specially when you have the venue already☺️
ugh i’m finishing my certificate to become a wedding planner & it would’ve been such a dream to help you plan your wedding 🤩 this makes me so excited to finish it !!!!
Congrats on your engagement Gabi, I am so happy for you and Collin! I am a Bridal Consultant, and can tell you that the two main things to have secured a year out from your wedding date is the venue and your gown!  P.s, This fancy baby bridal consultant would love an invite to the wedding, I will make sure your train and veil are always looking perfect! Lol
You should definitely pick the venue first then the dress
Gab.... I love you so much. 🤍 grace:)
It makes me so happy how close you are getting to our Lord and savior 💜💜💜
Hey beautiful my sister recently got married and she picked a dress heaps before but her weight fluctuated closer to the day and the dress didn't fit properly and she had to get it retailored so just be careful xx venue and catering definitely first 💛
I would wait to find the dress because a year and a half is a long time, you might change your mind about it or find one you like more 💜
Venue or beach spot first girl then work around that you def need the venue or spot you're getting married after you can decide the decor
Find a venue or spot and book it first
Gabi, you should patch test before using new products next time. Be careful always! xo
Can you do a video with Collin and let him talk about how he picked out the ring and did the proposal?
I would love to see you on "Say Yes To The Dress" but they are probably not filming while this pandemic tho 😓💖 love you soooo much and congratulations 💖 so happy for you!
Grace is my middle name and my best friends first name. It’s so special to me 💖
love youuuuuuuuu! happy new year
Gabi my friend got engaged the same day you did and she's found something that most likely is it. But her dream has been to go to kleinfield for a dress. Have you thought about going there?
gab! you have to have your hair black for the wedding! the black hair with your white wedding dress on the beach?? omg 😍🤍💍
PURRRR 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I’m getting emotional 😭
Okay but your makeup looks SO GOOD
Y’all are getting married on my birthday 🥺✨💜
So happy for uu💕💕💕
So happy for you Gabi and Collen 😭❤️❤️ been so happy since I saw the announcement video. May the good Lord be with you always and bless your union 🤗❤️
Her wedding is for sure going to be dreamy 🥺😍 omgggg 💓💓
You are such a wonderfully women glad you found your hubby 😇
🌸I am so happy for you sending all good wishes and prayers for you I hope you’ll be happy with him and get old with each other I love you 💕
Enjoy this time girl! It goes by sooo fast! 💕
omg her and ariana are engaged at the same time. omg gabi
girlie! I'm do happy for you, and i hope you and collen have an amazing life together<3
Pick a date and how many people you’re going to have, the venues will ask for both.
ok I'm super excited that you guys got engaged you two are very beautiful and I love watching your guys's vlogs.
I'm a fairly new subscriber.  I love your videos. I seriously do not understand why you get so much hate. I love your personality and I'm super happy for you and your engagement.  Your videos are so fun to watch and I'm rooting for you. Let the haters hate, you are fabulous!!
My dad and stepmom just got married not to long ago (i was a bridesmaid) and what my stepmom did was buy a wedding planner book, and she said that was really helpful bc it will tell you around how far in advance to book things
gabis hair look so pretty it looks almost rose gold 0:40
I booked my venue and celebrant first since it needed to be booked like a year in advance! Then I chose my dress based on my venue which was garden themed. But do whatever feels right :) Maybe ring a few venues and celebrants to get an idea on the waiting list? Some can be 2 years in advance!
Budget, pick a date and figure out what u want if u want for places for the venue or even where the ceremony is going to take place... I would ask your mom because she would be able u to help u with those details
I bought my dress first and then planned everything else, I will be getting married 6-26-21
I like how Colin hops in her pink bed idk y but it’s so cute to me
Aww, beautiful as always. Congratulations on your engagement! I wonder if the ring cleaner is keeping you in that reaction phase. I polish my lotion covered pretties with a microfiber towel or the cute little wash cloths made for babies' skin, and that Tiffany cleaner will always be pretty on a shelf. I'm so happy for you. I always felt you two were endgame. 💙😇💎💍👗👰🤵
Definitely pick your date and venue first! Venues get booked fast! Then your dress! They say to get your dress a year before the wedding so they have time to make changes if need be.
Ughhh ur growing up too fast gab i still remember when u were u were 20😭😭😭 love u wish u the best
Wow I'm so glad you're doing better. Sending you love <3
gabi is the princess. colin is the prince. their wedding is a fairytale!
OMG THEY GOT ENGAGED! I love you and Collins together ya’ll are meant to be together
OMG I'M SOO EXCITED congrats🎉🎊🎁
I remember Kyle and Rachel are supposed to be hosting your bachelor and bachelorette parties. -.
I’m so happy for gabi and Collin 🤗
Book your venue first. That way you know when it will be available. Venues fill up fast! 😊
Love the prayer 🙏 ♥️
I honestly would book your date now. The sooner the better. I feel like everyone got engaged November and December after 2020, or are re-booking their weddings. So I feel like 2020 weddings plus everyone who just got engaged are all trying to book now.
I feel like gabi is not telling us something..
I cannot wait for more bridal vlogs! 🤍✨🕊
her wedding venue is gonna be winter wonderland meets renaissance era meets fancy.
When is her wedding?
Love your videos
hey gabi if you see this, your so pretty and im so happy your happy and i started crying when you said your married!! congrates girlie <3
From my personal experience first dress is the one, at least in my case (I've tried 2 lol, and was done with trying them on in 15 min) but my point is when you know you know. Congrats 😊
Hey if you need an inexpensive floral designer I’m your girl💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Love the outro with the devotion prayer. 🙏 Keep spreading the truth!! Jesus loves y’all!
love praying with you gabi 🖤
Your such an inpiration to me, I am so happy for you and Collin. Best Wishes!! Stay safe. <3
im so happy for her omg😭💘 I bet your wedding will be a fairytale, it will be beautiful, congratulations queen ilysm😙😙
It's about time you get married yall are so cute together I prayed that you would get married

Hey just want to say that hope you and Colin stay happy forever and love each other like this only.💜
I’m so excited for all this wedding content
LOVE THE PRAYERS AT THE END💖💖
Are you going to vlog your wedding
Pick the venue & the person whos marrying you a pastor is busy schedule those 2 asap . the dress can take 3 to 6 months to alter so keep that in mind .
I got my wedding dress as soon as I got engaged it was the first dress I ever tried on and 2 years later was my wedding and I was stillllll sooooo obsessed with my dress 6 years later and I am stillll in love with it lol
I still remember she saying whenever I get married I want to wear the Cinderella shoes🥺😍
Congrats angel!!! So happy for you and Collin💓💗💓💗🥺🥺
what color is your nail polish?? I am obsessed
Nothing in the universe is stopping you. Remember god is in control and only god. Look to him for guidance and direction not superstition! ❤️

umm first u need to pick dream venue and book it ASAP. second u should buy shoes after you pick dress. then make a guest invite and tell ppl to save the date!!  then get a catering service with all selected dishes asap too!! and cake deserts appetizer etc...if ur planning wedding within next 10? months!!) then u should pick people in the wedding and tell them (or buy them ) thier outfits!! last steps should be frilly things such as flowers, colours, centre pieces, music all still important but not first priority!! hope this helps some!!! i’m so excited for you and your future 🤍🤍🤍🤍

Congratulations you were married I hope your a happy person
Congratulations 🍾
Jesus loves you! John 3:16!
Just hire a wedding planner.....
Yessss queennnnnn 💯💯💯✨
I picked a date by deciding what month and year with my fiancé at the time then went to venue because they need to have a date open. Then got my dress took like 7 months for it to come in) and bridesmaid dresses   sent save the dates 6 months prior to wedding date and hired all professionals for wedding such as rentals, cake, dj
From personal experience, people often wait one year after getting engaged to have their wedding. I would suggest maybe planning the wedding venue and picking the dress around a month before the wedding. Getting your dress right after the engagement in my opinion is a little too soon.
Omg seeing you in the dresses 😭🖤
Her wedding will litterly be amazing. Her and Colan are great to gather. I'm very happy for them.❤
I do have a little tip I’m not sure if it would count turd you but I think that it is smartest to get your dress last because you never not how long it will truly be till your wedding and you will never now if you had grown or got smaller or change any way physically so it may be a perfect fit now but you never know what is going to change in the next year or so
I cried
We gonna need to know why the name change back 🤔
💙
I’m sorry what did I miss-
Gabi, congrats on your engagement. you are Beautiful bride
I planned my own backyard wedding! Make sure to have back up plans Incase weather or anything falls through. I also got my dress 4months before my wedding to ensure there was time for alterations and that my body weight or anything like that wouldn’t fluctuate to much.  Congratulations and I wish you the best on planning and your beautiful marriage, you guys are truly soulmates, love you both ♥️🙏🏻
Crazy ariana posted hers and days later hers gabi i guess itty bittys got the same mind
im so happy for her <3
Buy a wedding planner!  It will help with timelines and how to get started. :)
I’m so happy for you gab 🥺🤍
💜💜💜💜
Isn't it crazy that her and Ariana are engaged at the same time?!! 😊
I remember when they really wanted to get engaged in Bermuda this year but that didn’t happen..
What about Alex? Wouldn’t she want Alex to be there too?
I really loved the prayer at the ending 🤍
Omg I am sooo happy for you I was gonna comment on ur insta but there was too many comments already lol
I’m SOOO happy & excited for you!! 🥰💗
love the music that you both produce.
You have the sweetest kindest soul I’ve ever seen congrats to you and nothing but blessings  coming your way ❤️ sending love from Compton 🥳
I noticed we have the same pink brush !
for event planning i recommend Cassiano Oliveira Photography for wedding/engagement photography!! he's located in the lehigh valley and does incredible work :) congrats on the engagement!!!
I’ve never planned a wedding before, but when i do plan things like for trips I usually start with the simpler things like clothes or a dress, shoes, makeup, venue, dates, and themes. I hope you have a wonderful year.
My friend got engaged during thanksgiving break, booked a venue and found her dress a few days ago
I just KNOW there’s gonna be those *few people* that’ll say “sHE gOt eNGaGeD tO bE liKe aRIanA”
Why is your channel name fancy vlogs by gab?
i absolutely love that gabi is taking the time to incorporate the gospel in her videos! so exited for you and this whole wedding journey 🤍🤍
Number one tip for wedding planning... HIRE a wedding planner!! If you are getting married in the Philly area, I absolutely loved working with Andi from Forever Love Events!! 💍💍💍💍
I’m hoping to get married in may but it’s probably not gonna happen til next year. We’ve been together for 15 years what’s one more year lol congrats gabbie
Happy New Year Gab💐❤🤗
Wait to get your dress! You may change your mind by another year or year and a half. Also get the wedding planning book from hobby lobby that is a great place to start
I love how Gabi loves old vintage stuff
The song at 7:20 is genius
When is her album coming out I know it’s some time this month!!!!  Fandom.com says Jan 5th
Get a wedding planar
Omg I have been waiting for them to get married *forever.* I’m sooo excited for the wedding vlog!👰 🤵💒💕
Gabi's blonde hair is literally such a look!
Aw Gabi I am So Happy For You
You know damn well that ring is not getting cloudy haha
omgosh i just bought that exact same flooring lol. ia it peel and stick? do you love it?
Can you do a video on how to be a girly girl?
She still looks pretty even tho she looks like she got stung by 30 bees 😭😭🤣🤣🤣💞👑
Yo I just realized her and Ariana got engaged basically at the same time..that pretty cool
Fancy babies are invited to the wedding right????
I love you gabi and I am so glad that you’re doing much better . 💖
I love the pink & white shirt she was wearing , anyone know where you can find them ?
Wedding wire app
I work for a wedding dress company and it takes forever to get a dress customized and altered so definitely dress first
I kept my wedding decor simple with just table decor with centerpiece, chair sash, his & her table, cake table, and handmade wood sign. There are apps and online sites now that can help you stay organized plus  Zola registry, wedding hashtag idea generators on IG, and helpful videos on youtube.
Get a wedding planner girl! They’ll help you through the whole process. It’ll save so much stress, you need to enjoy these precious moments 🥰
Your dress needs to be big and a princess
I swear Gabi looked like a princess in every dress
Is it a Pnina Tornai😍😍😍😍😍
Hey Gabi I been a supporter forever !!! Notice me 😔
YAYYY it’s fancy vlogs 💖
gab really said “my channel name may have changed but the same shit happens everyday” lmao
Why haven’t you use loaded in the main channel :(
I love how she is know reading prayers in vlogs love you gabi 💕😘
Gabi you deserve all the best and I’m so happy for you and your new family to be! Bless you love you.
you inspire me in my faith. i really needed that prayer. you’re beautiful !!
so happy for you and so glad you stayed strong!!🤍🤍
u both are the cutest couple i have ever seen  ...... Congratulations'
I send this to allllll my friends right as soon as they get engaged it helps so much with planning and  organizing. https://www.amazon.com/Wedding-Planner-Checklist-Portable-Organizing/dp/1441321543/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=bridal+checklist+book&qid=1609816885&sprefix=bridal+chec&sr=8-5
does anyone know what cosmetic product made her face swell?
Pick your date but at the same time still be flexible because some people book theirs a year and half in advance
Pick what season or month y’all would like to get married, then go look at venues. I feel like picking the month really determines everything (color scheme, indoor/outdoor ceremonies, decor, etc).
Your wedding is going to be so enchanting you’re going look so beautiful gabi I’m so excited for you ✨💕
Quite honestly when I was planning my friends wedding with her we used wedding wire :) it was so ooooooh helpful
I planned my ENTIRE wedding. I cared more about my date than the venue. So it depends! I would say if you care about the venue more I would get to that venue and book a date so at least you get that in the books. If you care about a date more you probably have some time considering you mentioned a year and a half!
Pick the place first to see the available dates that might help you pick a date
Beautiful prayer!
I can totally see a fairy style or royal style wedding.
Congratulations
I bought the first dress I tried on for my wedding
I just know gabi is going to be a fairytale. I’m so happy for y’all! I love u!
You deserve to be happy ❤️
I love how happy she is in this vlog gabi ilysm♡
i just got married in october! super excited for you!!
I think wedding dates can be feb 25 or March 13 !
Haha I just realized your sisters are Niki & Alex , uncle Jesses twins names from Full House 🤣
The first thing I did was pick my dress before a location. After that we picked the date and venue... once that was done I felt lost, I started by picking my color scheme, flowers, centerpieces and then it started coming together.
That prayer was so beautiful Gabi, thank you🥺
Your wedding is going to be gorgeous
definitely wait for the dress because it will take a long time for the wedding to happen and you might change your mind about it
i really love the prayers that she's been including in her vlogs. also, once again, congrats on your engagement!! 💕✨
YOU AND COLLIN ARE  ALWAYS AND FOREVER.
AHH SO EXCITING !!!💗💗
There is many wedding planning apps that would be helpful for your wedding planning iPad !!!
Can I be a braids maid?
Hey I actually got married two years ago and funny the first dress I tried on was the one. I tried on 20 others but knew it was the one right away. I would just say take your time enjoy the process with your loved ones. Everything will fall into place when they are supposed to. And congratulations so happy for you both🍾
Omgggggg gabi im so so excited for ur wedding n so happy for u n collin love u 🎉💕
girl pls give us a hair tutorial on those curls u had in the storytime
Thanks for sharing that beautiful prayer.
so happy she’s fancy vlogs by gab again
I totally understand falling in love with the first dress you try on! I did with mine and it was the best decision I made!
I'm gonna be living vicariously through these vlogs, ive been with the same guy 6+ years and I wanna get engaged 😂
OMG SHES FINALLY ENGAGED!!!! CONGRATS GABIIII! I have been watching for 3 years! all love girl! :)))
the wedding to gonna look magical 💜
Holy, what skin care product caused that??
I teared up when I saw this, and I haven’t even seen the dress, I know that whatever dress she picks it’s going to be just perfect for her
I planned my own wedding almost five years ago (may 27th!) and The Knot is your best friend. Keeps you on track & has a checklist. Very hwlpful
When is niki and gabi coming back
Awww I’m so happy for you guys💜😭
it makes me so so happy that gab is getting even closer to God and sharing God with everyone☺️
I got my dress first! Then we decided on venue and date, then from there we decided on decor and on wedding party attire, then food and little things!
I think you should do the dress first then location, flowers and services
Rinsee the jewelry after cleaning!!!!!!!
I might be a good guesser because I think it’s the Wtoo by Watters Miles, dress! Btw congratulations, girly!🤍👰🏻‍♀️🤵🏻💒💐🦢
I’m not married but I have help family members plan their weddings and dress first and the venue because the dress takes a while with fitting and the venue because you can see the days that they have available and pick the best one for you :)
I’m soo excited for the wedding vlog ❤️❤️❤️
Definitely book the venue first. Most ppl book their venues a year in an advance.
Congratulations on getting engaged gabi
your glowingg ✨
I’m so glad you are reading things like this from the Bible! love this!!!
I’m soooooooo excited for you !!!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭❤️
My cousin had the same elergic reaction and her face looked the same I’m so sorry this happened to you but I’m glad your ok. Also she never found out what it was so it’s a mystery.
The prayer was everything! He is going to treat you guys so well! Take your time  sis, your wedding is going to be so beautiful! 😘❤
Thank God it went down❤️🙏🏽
Omg this so is exciting just to watch ( the wedding part )
We wanna see the wedding! 💗 ps. so happy for you Gabi 💕

Hi Gorgeous Mrs. Vogt! How stunning are you! 😊🌺

GABI YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN JEANSSSSSS
What was the product that caused the reaction?!
I love how her candle says “smells like I’m getting married” that’s so cuteeeee
I'm not married and not planning a wedding but I have a suggestion make a mood board so you can put idea, colors, the all around vibe you want your future wedding to be
This gives me Bridgerton vibes
okay but like the blue shoes at 2:26 r soooooo pretty
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
Loving the scripture Gabi & congrats  😇🍾🤴👰
I’m so happy your getting married 😁😁
Gabs wedding is gonna look like a real life fairy goddess princess movie and I’m so here for it. 😇🤍🙌🏼🥺🥰
Omg I’m so glad fancy vlogs is back! I’m so excited also for all the wedding planning videos! 🤍
Gabi is literally so beautiful ❤️
Dress and venue are definitely the first things you should be looking for! So you can book and so alterations can be made in time if needed for the dress! You're doing amazing girl!
hello love! i worked in the bridal industry for 3.5 years it’s best look at venues you’ve had an eye on then to figure out the day you want to get married and book that venue!🤍 venues tend to book fast so it’s good that you’re doing a year and a half out! congratulations on your engagement🤍💍
Venue and date first. Problem with dress is style, taste and trends do change so often that you might change your mind. You should look at the beautiful covid elopements people are doing in their beautiful gowns on mountain tops. Could always do a private romantic ceremony and party after covid
I’m so beyond excited for her omg!!! She deserves so much!!!
this is the earliest i have ever been lol
I'm getting married in September so I am very excited to watch your future wedding vlogs :)
When’s the wedding??
congrats Gabi been waiting for this news
I think February 22,2022 would be a great date to get married. Then when you write it out in a numerical way it will be 2-22-22 ♥️.
Gabi is going to be the most gorgeous beautiful princess bride ever
Congrats btw !!! 🥂 🍾 👰
It amazes me when people jump on wedding planning because I've been engaged for 3 years 🤦
I love the toilet paper dispenser but it is waay too high up for me , are you supposed to stand up to wipe yourself ? TMI but what’s happens when you’re on your monthly cycle ?!  😳
I’m sure you’ve done this already but hit up Pinterest! They have the best timelines and ordered lists for the wedding planning process. It tells you what you should focus on first and throughout.  Good luck & Congrats!!
I love how Gabi's doing prayers/messages at the end 🤍
Im excited for her
I helped my mom plan her wedding, the best adivce i can give second hand is have help from your family not only are they helpful but it was so fun planing with my mom amd aunts and cousins and lucky you with a twin. Let your family help you its so fun! @fancy vlogs by gab
So excited for the wedding ! Omg.  😍🤗
Venue and date and then everything else ! I’m planning my wedding now! June 12th , 2021
Love the prayer! 🙏🏽🙌🏽❤️
The first dress i tried on was the one! I knew exactly what I wanted, found it and couldn't let it go! Sometimes that just happens!!! We're lucky!
Just watched the video on Grace, thank you so much for sharing! 💕💕 it was an amazing explanation!
im so  happy for you
Also I heard you say you want to get married on the beach, you should look into destination weddings because they typically let you come back on your one year at a discount price (I believe)
So exciting!!!
Guys she said the dress was like mama Mia. Keep in mind!
Carrie I am so happy for you you are a beautiful young lady and you deserve to get married and I love your dress you look like a beautiful princess
You have so much grace! All your videos make me feel safe! Thank you for sharing these special moments with us! I love to see you happy! 🖤
Do you not post on niki and Gabri anymore
she a queen
i’m so happy for you guys gabi 🥰
Fancy vlogs?
Yay I'm happy for you
Wait! Did you get your rhinoplasty in PA? I’m from PA and I have been wanting a rhinoplasty for a very long time so I’m finally looking into doctors and such.
Gabi I hope you know that all your fans truly love you. Im so happy to see you and Colin engaged, your relationship is so beautiful! Thank you for the Bible verses, they are helping me in my day to day life and helping me build a relationship with God. Much love and happy new year!!!!!
You were butifull before your Botox and lip filler. Now your fake
guys i bet her dress is like a woodzy lacy fairytale garden dress 🥺😩
That’s a really odd place to put toilet paper lol
I want to see the dress
Yes, Gabi!! Thank you for reading that prayer! The word Grace is definitely something that needs to be a top priority in this New Year!! 👏🏼💛
Check out Tess Christine she did a whole wedding series about planning her wedding 👰.... trigger warning just incase - she is pregnant atm
Have a budget, that usually helps out most  Look at venue's, but be cautious due to the pandemic most business are shutting down.   I say get creative. Get the dress!   Usually,  it's the Venue's,  Catering than dress picking.   Planning goes into details, usually the more details the better, especially having a theme helps out the most
I’m in the same boat as you I got engaged on Friday November 13th
Base the wedding around the dress because the dress and you are the star on your wedding day
GABI!!! I got engaged in September. I totally ended up falling in love and buying the first dress I tried on too ❤️❤️❤️
the mom jeans looked so good !!! 😩💝😍
Is the album still coming out tomorrow? I am wondering
Okie. I've been waiting so long for this video. I have nothing else to say bit Gabi has changed my life. I've been waiting for so long. Ilysm!
Picking a venue and finding an official date has helped me wrapped my head around wedding planning! I am getting married August 14th :) also congratulations on your engagement!
Use the Zola app! That has been a life saver for wedding planning!
OMG I'm praying you get married before me so I can get inspo from your wedding!! 🤩
I have way more interest in this wedding than the royal wedding, lol
Gabi Why did you change your name to gabi vlogs And then change it back to fancy vlogs by Gabi  Can you please tell me why
I'm soooo happy for you gorgeous!!
Omg you look so happy❤❤
why isnt anyone talking about how she is getting married preatty young for being in the spot light she is in like the youngest ive seen someone that is famous getting married is like 27 anyway enought with my rants lol
Will u be posting your wedding?
I've been using wedding wire it's been helping me out big time with the planning
Oh my gosh I’m going to cry 😭 your going to be a wife so crazy!!! I’ve watched you since day one honestly this is truly crazy
I’m so glad you changed your name back to fancy vlogs.It just wasn’t the same 🥰🥰
uhm this video is ❤️❤️
Early also Congratulations 🥰
I always have Benadryl with me because I get allergic rxns randomly sometimes!!
Love you gab and I'm so happy for you and collin! <3
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Honestly what I do when planning a party or something like that I go to party city website and they have a free template/ agenda on what to do and what to do first when planning a party and I just alternate it a little bit to fit what I need. :)
Pick a venue first and then see if they have a date you like in mind! Pro tip make sure the venue has a good wedding coordinator that comes in your package! 💕
00:31 Where is that Top from 😭🙏
I never seen gabi with jeans
I literally have a face allergic reaction right too  It’s sooo dry and red and swelling
Please do a step by step wedding planning🥂💍 I’m so lost and I already know you will plan everything like how I want it✨ AND your ring 😭😍!!!! I’m actually in love ... I never fall in love with a ring but when I saw yours I knew that’s exactly the cut and shape
5 days
It’s so crazy how she’s getting married like I grew up with Niki and Gabi 😭 I’m so happy for her
So happy for you Gabi!!! Congratulations, I feel like I grew up with you!
Congratulations on your engagement! 🎉❤ I got married September 2020, and planned my own wedding. I picked the venue and date first, then found my dress and everything snowballed from there! 😍
Congrats 😊
Love the vlog prayers, pls keep doing them, they bring comfort. Love you Gabi 💗
Congratulations Gabi.
I literally cried watching ur last video 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
you should check out Nitsan Raiters channel because she’s also engaged and it might be useful to see how she’s doing things during this time 🤍
Oh my god gabi YOU LOOK gorgeous in the dress! Well u look gorgeous in ANYTHING. And I’m so happy for u and Collin! Your wedding is going to be like a fairy tale and be beautiful! Love you so much! Happy new year 🎈🎆 😘
1. Venue Venue Venue this determines the date, the guest maximum/minimum, any amenities or controlled factors (then food, beverage, music/entertainement, and everything else can fall into place) I would have said budget first but not sure if this applies.
That head band is giving me Sabrina vibes ❤️✨ you look lovely 😊
Weren't you planning on releasing your album on January 5th?? Is that still happening?
Me waiting for my invitation for the wedding to come in the mail😁
I never got married so idk BUT ur doing fine u need to make a date THEN wedding venue
Are you getting married during the pandemic or are you gonna wait till it’s over?
Gabi so happy for your engagement please do a wedding series so we can see your journey to your wedding 👰🏻 💒
you should inv ariana🙂.
on your left hand i think you should only wear your engagement ring. it deserves its own moment!
I love that your adding God in your vlogs thats so awesome
maybe it was the mask that caused the allergic reaction
I’m glad you’re feeling better.  💞
She better be getting the jimmy choo Cinderella shoes for her wedding LOL. (She said she’d get them in her early shopping vlogs!)
I’m sooo happy for you Gabi your amazing and hope you and Collin have the best  future together and hopefully one day a beautiful child together❤️ -your fancy baby
I bet her bachelorette party is going to be CRAZYY
Thank you for sharing that beautiful prayer! I am so grateful that you are feeling better! I love your personality. I started watching your videos due to that and your compassion. May God continue to bless you and your family!
Wedding planning Tip!   I got married in November last year, my biggest tip would be to buy the Dress and sort out the venues/date first. If you do this it makes it alot easier to bring everything else together like decorations, colours and themes. ❤
this is the cutest fancyvlog ever
Congrats I am so happy for you you look so cute 🥰
Okay Gabi has been looking extra fine lately maybe it’s the ✨happy glow✨
Wedding planners are so helpful!! I would definitely look in to one! Also, talking to a married friend is soo helpful!!
Date and Venus
Hey girl! I work in the wedding industry. I recommend a 2 year engagement.  First you pick your venue Then you pick your dress  From there you pick your wedding theme.   Once you have a wedding theme than you pick your photographer that matches your wedding theme:)   If you need anymore advice let me know.
so happy you found your romeo, praying to God everynight that i'll find mine. Thank you for being you.. God bless you always.
Not me crying, cause I'm so happy for you 🥺❤
IM SO HAPPY FOR THEM I HAVE BEEN WAITING THEY PROVE THAT LOVE IS REAL
4:12 that text tho 😂😂
omggg a cosmetic reaction same i got one  about 2 years ago and i wash my face with this new product and woke up all swollen i was laughing and was acually scared
Ahhh yes!
*That allergic reaction seems so scary. Thank God everything is all better now.*
Is it just me or do you just love it when she says ''My Ring''
Where’s ur ring from
Congratulations 💐
♥️💟💘💛💚💙💜🖤💦
gabi what eyeshadow pallets do u recommend ilysm btw boo 🤍
I cannot WAIT to see THEE dress 😍 Gabi you’re gonna be such a beautiful and magical princess on your wedding day 🥺 I’m so happy for you 🤍
I highly recommend downloading the wedding wire app and pick a date and it will tell you when you do center things in a timeline it was a life saver for me when I was planning my wedding and you can also put your budget information into the app as well
I hope your doing better beautiful you look amazing as always
Your wedding is going to be so beautiful like a fairytale
those slippers that said bride are the ones that we found on your instagram before you announced the engagement! congrats gabi!
i’m not gonna cry.... i’m totally crying 🥺💛
Hiii Gabi! I’m so excited for you. I’m getting married in 2022! 🥰💗 it’s so fun to plan!
I am so happy for u congrats!!!!!
Maybe the universe is just allergic to your fake unnatural ass 😅
Congratulations
If you're touching your mask then you might as well not even wear one.
Gabi's wedding style is probably so cute! Congrats on the engagement yall!😊💞💞💞
hey gabi, i just wanted to say that i lost my sister last year on this day and you were her favorite youtuber and she always said she wanted to meet/talk to you one day and i'm telling you now!!
i am so happy for them omggggg. she’s an angel 🤍
Awww sorry gabi that that happened to you 🥺
OMG YASSSSSS QUEEEENNNN
where is your ring from!? it’s stunning
i thought she wanted to elope
Happy your dreams are coming true. Congratulations!
I love u but is colin happy with the fancy glam house
I’m so excited to watch this journey w Gab and Collin omg
I am just sooo excited for gabi she deserves all the love in the world and I am so happy for her and collin! 🥰
This is so exciting. Haha I'm getting married in 3 months and I'm freaking out. So much to do and im terrified the world right now will ruin it. 😆 ugh.
Her weddings gonna look like a fairytale
cool channel name
The content I need in life
Why couldn’t Niki go? You went to a dress shop that had random strangers but you couldn’t also have your sister or mom there?
Congratulations to you and Collin and really good vlog
Order your dress 1-2 sizes up depending on the style and make. I loved my dress and ordered the size closest to my measurements and when I got it 7 months later the fit looked totally different on me in a way I didn’t appreciate. If you get it a little big you can tailor it down perfect to fit you like a glove!
Gabi ur vlogs never fail hahaha loved this!! Always makes my day :))
Congratulations  on your engagement!! I am so happy for you I cried happy tears watching your previous video <3
I am really hoping she does a whimsical style wedding it would look so amazing with her aesthetic
you will be the most beautiful bride 🥺💕💗
Did she change her vlog name back to fancy vlogs from gabi vlogs? 👀👀👀👀
I wish she was my mom tho who agrees
The lady helping out is such a kind soul
OMG YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Gabi literally had a Carrie Bradshaw moment where she had an allergic during wedding planning except you actually want to get married😂. I’m glad you’re feeling better Gabi.
I think she looked stunning in every dress! im jelly lol
Yes book a year in advanced!  Venus book up fast! Well at least wear I live.
I have suffered extreme allergic reactions due to thyroid disease. I've shared videos on my channel about this
Cinderella dress shopping  I got so emotional when I saw you dress shopping little Gabriella is all grown up she’s found her Prince and she’s going to look like a fairy tale princess the dresses are giving Cinderella vibes💍👑🪞🕊
I’m so excited for this wedding
Happy New year everyone. I’m so excited for the bridal vlogs 💍
Been praying to find more christian media to listen to. Overjoyed to see you talking about the Lord in your vlogs now! <3 Congratulations on the engagement!
I would say venue first, that way you can truly visualize how the decor will look as you buy it. Also savor everything, my wedding day was 8am-9pm but it felt like if went by in 5 minutes. ♥️♥️♥️
Is there a such thing as an engagement glo✨? Cause Gabi def has it
I love u CUTIEE
So happy for you Gabi 💕❤️ hope you all have a great 2021
still pick the venue date
She’s glowing
i think you should enjoy the fact that you guys are simply just engaged for a little and then in a couple month start the wedding planning ☺️
aww, Karly is such a great friend
you two deserve each other 100000000000% 🤍
I know the excitement is big and I'm so so happy for you!!! But maybe you should   for a lil bit because everyday is taking a different turn with the world circumstances. However, a lil wedding dress shopping never hurt nobody  💗💗
Congratulations on your engagement 💍
Venue first helps with the date but honestly if you have already fell in love with the dress it doesn't matter. Everything will fall into place.
I’m so happy. Watching you and Niki for 8 years oh my god. I knew you would get married and Collin is the luckiest guy to have you as a wife.
I wish i could have seen niki and their moms reaction to the dress:( the audio was hard to understand. So excited for u tho!!🥂
Okay I'm just saying it would be amazing to go to her wedding I know she would never invite me but I can only imagine how pretty it will be!!
GUYS WE HAVE AN ALBUM RELEASE TONIGHT
Gabi I’m so beyond happy for you ahhhh the feels in this video 🥲👰🏼‍♀️🤴🏼🥂🕊🤍
Love your videos 🎥 Gabi keep going Queen 👸
Use the app wedding wire
Find a venue first cause places are booking like crazy for the future due to cancellations from covid (at least in New Jersey). My future sister in law bought the first dress she tried on before finding the venue! Go with your gut! It's going to be such a magical wedding! <3 Oh also, there are a ton of facebook bride groups to join that give really helpful tips and whatnot!! Love the vlogs and can't wait to see more wedding content! <3
I have been waiting sooooo long for you guys to get married
Congratulations on your engagement!!!!💍💍💍
Gabi is going to be the most beautiful bride, I look forward to watching the whole wedding process come together over the next year
Hi love your videos!!
I think considering the current situation, you’re going about wedding planning the right way. It makes sense to have your dress picked out first, especially since you still have to get it altered. For now, focus on figuring out the theme, colors, bridesmaids dresses, and groomsmen suits. I think you should pick a date and venue in a few months. Take time to see how 2021 might play out. Hope that’s helpful. ♥️
Try picking a date or around what time you would like the wedding. This would make it easier if you want a theme, the colors and the venue
Love you gab and congratulations princess
i think dresses can give a v special vibe ! also, your vibe / theme for the wedding can always be influenced by the venue, so it may be best to pick your venue first. also pair the things you’re planning w the season. that way everything will be able to coordinate beautifully just the way you like ! i love u gab. u are doing everything so so perfectly, my love.
Get a wedding planer ... shanon(shanonxo) if you know her from Australia she’s also gonna get married and she said the best thing that she has done since she started planing for the wedding is getting a wedding planner sooo...
Im finally get to see gabis wedding because shes like the fanciest one EVER😍im so excited to see !!!😭so happy for her! i was abit sad cuz niki and her mom couldnt be there :(
Thank you for changing my life for the better and thank you the little things that you do that bring me joy ❤️ happy new year gabi❤️
With COVID I wouldn’t pick a day or book a venue first, start with the smaller details like what your invitations will look like, who you want to come, what cake you want to have etc!!
I’m so happy for you! And your ring is stunning! It looks like it’s so perfect for your style too ♥️
omg so happy for you!! ❤️ ❤️  Also you changed your channel name back to Fancy vlogs by gab?!
Girl! I planned my whole wedding! Let’s talk ig: @lila.talks
My friend used Zola for her wedding! It turned out amazing!  Here a link as well for tips! Your wedding is going to be a true fairytale.   https://www.brides.com/gallery/how-to-plan-your-own-wedding
You should get married at Pretty Place Chapel
Beautiful ring is that a aquamarine center stone ?
Yaaaas!!!! So happy to watch this!!!! Been checking your profile all day for any new uploads lol. Now I can open my wine.
Hi gabby I’m a fan
I picked my dress out before I did anything. Everything revolved around the dress.
check out Michelle Reed's videos on wedding planning!
GABI YOU HAVE TO GO TO SEINFELD
Congrats on your engagement 😁 gabi
Baby gabi might come soon
Definitely pick a date first ❤️❤️
I.had and allergic reaction.to either powder or the foundation.. By the time i when to my.prom my whole face was red i had to wash face in the bathroom on my prom dance!! I had to leave and took some benadryl...
Boo I am sooooooooo happy for you!!!!! When is your album coming out I’m a little confused about that. I love you and Collin. You are a queen💜💜💜💜💜💜
I got married 12/12/20 :) planned my whole wedding myself :). Best thing to do is pick a date and find a venue! But be flexible with the dates :) sometimes the venue may not have that date so I would pick a month ❤️
Omg honey! I’m so happy for you!! I’m sure your wedding will be a little girls dream come true!!
My sister did a thing where she found her place and her flowers first.
Your so lucky I so happy for you!!!!!!
loving this hair color on you gabi! I'm getting rose gold vibes
is your favorite holiday now thanksgiving?
I get like that with fish and shell fish.
Can we just talk about how she was wearing jeans?!🥳🤩😇😌🤣
Fairy lights turn simple stuff magical
LOVE THIS! HAPPY NEW YEAR
early fancy baby !
I will definitely pick the venue as soon as possible since for many places you need to reserve that special date
I just realised it’s fancy vlog by gab again
Pick the venue first to make sure they have the date available
anyone else notice she changed her name back?!?!?!
You seem pregnant Gab😍. Congratulations on the engagement
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH I'M SO EXCITED!!!
Love you girl and why this always happens t0 you :(
She is going to look so pretty at her wedding, I wanna know the date...!
awwww im so happy for her!!
Where did you get your mask?
Since you already basically have your dress, yes, picking the venue is next. Decor, flowers, food, etc will depend on your venue n what the space looks like.
i am loving the prayersss ! we love you gabiii
She looked amazing in all the dresses!
I'm sorry but the outfit in 2:14  just living for it
I'm so happy for you Gabi, and for you and Collin. I love you guys. Major Congrats!!     🤗💞
Gab I’ve been following you since the beginning and omg I’m just sooo happy for you.. you deserve the world💞💞💞
congrats <3
This is so unbelievable that she is getting married I keep thinking she is dating but I have to think that she is engaged plus Niki and Nate should really get engaged or married btw congratulations Gabi and Collin
I picked the year first and then the date we wanted a 2 year engagement
Omg! Imagine the wedding! It will be like a fairytale!!  Edit: I had that hair brush!! Warning with it, if it gets to hot the handle with pop and the goo inside it, might get in your hair.
I hope you will get your own movie in fairytale style one day
currently planning a wedding  pick a date first! Then book the venue! do everything else after!!
fancy “vogts” by gab😌😌
Omg you look like a princess in every dress! I love how Cinderella is your inspired look for your dream wedding dress! 🤍🤍🤍
ugh so happy for you!!!!
I’m so happy for u and Collin 🤍♾ Romeo & Juliet
Gabi I love you like yes I am so glad you being open with us about god I know I said this before but I need you know that you and niki have helped me so much I love you 🤍🧚‍♂️
gab your gonna be the most beautiful bride🥺🥺
Cinderella and prince charming <3
What lip combo is that! So pretty
It’s the smells like I’m getting married candle 🕯 for me
for some reason, i imagine gabi sporting a lehenga😂 she'd look so princessey...
Gabi’s closet is really pretty! 🥺💘
She should find a venue first cause if she picks a date and the venue is not free on that day there will be problems ._.
I found my dress during my first time trying on dresses.  It wasn’t my first one I tried on but I tried on I think 5. It was such a fun experience, the whole wedding planning process was so much fun and memorable. I’ve been married going on 3 years!
We got engaged on the same day!! I’m picking the date and I picked the venue first! I think that’s the way to go.. hopefully lol! If you find any tips let me know too!!!
Love your channel so much
