GORILLAZ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
This trailer tricked me into thinking this game would be good
Song name?
Let’s be fr.. the online aspect for this game was a fat 0/10 but playing the game offline is a 10/10 for me
Mataram o jogo kakakaka , cadê a turma da diversidade que não comprou o jogo 😂😂😂
I still get sad about this
I just remembered that Wonder Woman had Flash bound up with the Lasso of Truth that frees people from mind control. This entire plot could have been avoided if she just used it to free the Justice League from the mind control. Pretty sure Brainiac's tech runs a distant second to a divine artifact from the gods that embodies truth itself.
Even though I know this game is bad, it will still forever hold my respect for this trailer introducing me to Gorillaz
1:22 1:47
Why are they pushing suicide squad on us like that? Who asked for this?
Song from trailer is amanzing Golliraz
So bad so bad
You guys could maybe make back the wasted cash from this project had you release the Arkham games in Volumes. Vol.1 Asylum and City. Vol.2 Origins and Knight
One of the worst games currently on Steam, it’s good that I got my money back for this garbage, it’s not worth a penny or a single minute of my time, and if you really like it, you clearly have problems in your head
What is this woke nonsense ? doesn't even make sense, all so brightly colored freaking g-a-y
It was a good trailer but the game is finally done
Well  That a twist plot 🫠
I truly want it to be known how much I actually hate these people and their ideas. I can only say I want my money back. Five dollars for this trash and all I got was rage.
Amazing trailer for a great game. Rocksteady did another masterpiece
This game is so trash.
The only good thing about revisiting this is hearing this epic version of Clint Eastwood
Hello rocksyeady, include pleade a way to play with local friends under splitscreen.
Years have passed and with all honesty Holly was i not ready to see this game Become A massive fail Even tho I might just Gonna give It one last chance With Deathstroke Being the last dlc cause its Been Ages since arkham origins and me wanting to him to be a playable character in an open world.
So... the $100 deluxe edition is now being sold for just $5 ?  What an insult to those who paid the full price. Even if YOU payed me $100 i still wouldnt play your game lol.
I played the game and it is bad I can’t even beat super man because of how rigged it is
The Worst Arkham Game
This game makes me want to play the old Arkham games.

This is a bada$$ trailer to have clint eastwood from gorillaz music this might be one of my fav trailers
This game sucks the squad would be killed in seconds by mind controlled JL members😡😡😡
This game was awesome the people who hate on it probably are lonely and didnt play it with friends
Only took five months for this game to be Free To Play. Oof. Glad i waited.
Sweet baby inc is behind it, guys
Over hyped bs 😂
I bought this game day one and if y’all are done doing weekly updates I am done playing 😂 lazy devs
Nope.
ignore the hate this game is great give it a shot
Ding dong, the game is dead. You guys really deserve the financial hit you’re absorbing. You should listen to fans. We pay your salaries…until we don’t. Enjoy the don’t aspect. I know I will. Kevin conroy’s last appearance in gaming is this abomination. Shameful.
WB 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
Trash game
Many dislike the game where I like it
here's hoping you find that "Modern Audience" maybe they can get you 200 million dollars.
REdfall was better then this time waster.... what a waste of life sinking time in to this heap!  should be Sued for making this Conroys last body of work as Batman.

Does anyone know what song they’re playing for the trailer?
This game sucks
thanks sweet baby oink
Anyone else looking at optimistic comments and looking for a 'this aged like milk' reply?
WOOOOOKKKKKKKKKKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Wow nice 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Whos ready for red hood to come and take out the suicide squad
Josiane José
I love this game idk why it gets hate i had 0 problems and the graphics on my pc are the best i have seen in any game ultra 1440p over 150fps you can see every single detail in their skin and clothes, i love the humor of this game the characters have alot of funny moments, arkham fans need to stop crying ik it's not a new batman but and i was annoyed at 1st as i am a huge batman arkham fan also but im not going to lie this new game did not disappoint me, i noticed steam players also complain about everything they are never ever happy even when a game is great probably why rockstar said F us pc players because of that exact reason people putting bad reviews and crying
FIX THIS GAME IS BAD STORY BAD ROCKSTEADY IS BAD  The Arkham storyline was ruined because of this game, this is the worst game
This is how it happened. This is how Rocksteady died.
Time for us bad guys to save the world
Suicide squad death of a decent game
How many dislike's we gota from this trash  game? 👎
what song is this?.
Killing Superman nad Batman was The worst thing what Rocksteady do
Never cook again lol
#OutZaslav #OutPerrette
I follow Batman series from early 90, as official fan I have to make a complaint against Suicide Squad. I'm truly disappointed about direction it has taken by WB...
nioceeeee
Gotta say, though I'm not too jazzed about this game with the leaks, the forced online and how it turned out, "Clint Eastwood"playing during the trailer is pretty epic.  0:45 is where it goes hardest.
Person who wrote this game, should stick pen in place where the sun don't shine. And keep it there
The comments on this trailer show the fans deserve the garbage game they got
I think this game shouldent have as much hate as it does, personally I love it, just while playing pretend its not a part of the archam universe
How is this still 70? 😂
So how many of you dumbasses still sticking up for the game let’s hear it ?
Arkham Knight is where the story ends. This is not Canon.
Lmao
Should’ve made Gotham city imposters 2
Get Woke, Go Broke
Y'all really lucky we don't spin for batman bruh. SHUTDOWN YOUR WHOLE STUDIO fam
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊mobili 🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
0:13  sigh….*checks comments*
This game's horrid writing made me truly dislike anything Suicide Squad related. Thank god I never bought this game, and I promise to boycott anything Suicide Squad related in the future.
bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!   I won't call this sh!tsta!n of a game made by Rocksteady...rather I ask you Sweet Baby Inc...how u all doin over there?!  how are the fraction of players u have left liking the game?!  stream count dips 85% in less than 2 weeks...I'm loving this!!!!!!
Evil Flash has both thumbs... Just saying... 🤔
Bring back batman
if only the actual game was like this, its dogshit
Yall deserve the hate you get for this game. Hope you never have the balls to do this to a fan base again.
Wauw Rocksteady made it! They were the Pioniers since Batman Arkham Series. I was waiting for that game and now?!?….its like they played Sunset overdrive and forgot about the staple they made with Batman. Now insomniac with Spiderman took them over completely and Wolverine is coming….good luck Rocksteady the only way to get back in the game is to make an new Batman Game for sure!
Rocksteady Arkham knight more better than this, they nerfed harley's cake
… The trailer was the only enjoyable thing about this game.
Bleeeeeh
This game is awful. How’s the live service going?😂😂😂😂
If i'm totally honest, I love this game
“Plot Armor: The Game”
Looking for a new game but this ain't it. All games and graphics are starting to look the same/dated.
Seems like a huge downgrade visually from Arkham Knights saga... Looks more like Fortnite.
2 Big missed opportunities -to set this in the Injustice 2 Evil Ending (Superman using Brainiac Tech to control humanity, hence why Waller would have it justified to have TFX to kill all the Justice League and it's not confusing why Batman is still alive or why this has anything to do with the Arkham games). -Online only story based games are/will/and forever are cancer to art and the gaming community. Release a single player offline mode (and bring the game to a sale of 25.99), then we will get your sales numbers back up.
Какое же вы сделали дерьмо
Rocksteady and WB lived long enough to become the villain. This game is terrible.
He's the fastest man alive according to all  his girlfriends bro he did him dirty 😂😂😂😂
хуйня,переделывайте
Guess we owe Gotham Knights a huge apology
gorillaz music in the trailer goes hard
GREAT GAME HIGHLY RECOMMEND DONT LISTEN TO THE CONROY CRYBABYS
Why the Batman from the Arkham games?? His death was so lame here, I'm not playing this
Get woke, go broke....and they did hahahahaha 😂
Rocksteady absolutely NAILED Captain Boomerang. He's hilarious!
Not being rude but why did this game take 3 years to make this game I mean it took longer for GTA 6 but still
WB: How much money shall we burn today? Devs: It's a lottery!
Looks boring and repetitive
At least this trailer was fire and hype
ESG is killing these studios.
This game is complete trash. It's a dishonor to the Arkham franchise
Diversity higher woke failure
All these fools wasting money on this pile of DS 🤡🤡🤡😂😂😂😂
The game is an absolute blast to play. Almost everyone complaining in the comments is a crybaby. There’s valid issues but crying about Batman’s death is PATHETIC. Play the game for yourself and make your own opinion 🤡🤡🤡
Harley Quinn shoots Batman in the head, killing him
Shut the whole thing down and hand it over to another studio.  Using a dead person as clout or advertisement while lying to us that its their last performance... you people are something else.
This game is 🐎💩
1:22 song name?
The real crime here is people actually paid for this garbage.
bad script because the suicide squad needs to have a strategy to end the justice league example go to batman's cave and get his idea
Vcs estragaram a franquia arkhan, desrespeitaram kevin Correy, vcs n tem respeito nenhum por nada só se importam em lucrar
I’m stuck in disgust, they butcher the League without even trying to help and I helped fund this. I’m appalled by myself and other fans who enjoyed this.
the only thing i like about this is the song. Sad to see this "game" exist.
This game and the devs are pure evil. This is a spitefull creation towards humanity and it should be removed from existence.
TRASHHH GET WOKE GO BROKE!
DC>Marvel
Batman gets shot in the head on a park bench. You deserved better Kevin Conroy.
How can a game in the same universe that is 9 years old (Batman: Arkham Knight) look multiple times better than this? Kind of hilarious how bad these games have become!
Suicide Squad kill the Arkhamverse and Rocksteady
Wow great way to honor Kevin Conroy by killing his character in the most pathetic/disrespectful way possible ridiculing him in the process…  All the build up since Arkham asylum…  FOR THIS BULL****
Pathetic game, have some shame
NO MORE HEROES??
I stand with Batman.
No Aquaman?
congrats WB you killed the frenchise, just like your streaming services.
you are idiots to let batman die like this, really disrespectful
They wanna be Suda 51 so bad 😭😭😭
Competing for worst triple A game of year challenge.  Cod has got some competition
It's the Gorillaz song
hate it
Justice league fans stay losing 😢 when do we get a good modern justice league game?
what a joke
gettin real tired of all the ad spam i'm getting for this game
Gorillaz <3
gunna flop so hard looks terrible
1:41 oh if only we knew what this scene actually was when the trailer first dropped...
If you are from any other country other than America I would not recommend buying this game as being a person who lives in New Zealand. I got tricked by Warner brother games what they did was false advertising. They told everybody around the whole entire world no matter what country you’re in the game will come out on the 30th at 12 PM. Not realizing that other countries around the world have different time zones now being from New Zealand I’m 24 hours ahead of every other country, so of course when it hits 12 o’clock on the 30th here I try to play it and it says the servers are in maintenance mode making it so that the game is completely unplayable on the alleged but as the consumer it’s not my fault that they’re too stupid to think of that which screws over my friends and my family members who want to play this game who already purchased it as well for $100 this is complete BS
Among Us
The boss fights definitely look better than the Arkham Boss fights.
Ehhhh what'd they do to Kevin's voice in this trailer??
Beatifiul
W game
what sadness
Why aqua man???
The super villains time has come to kill The justice league I feel they’re gonna enjoy this
I am ao looking forward to this game i am a fan of superheroes and this looks original and different in a good way. Nothing anyone says will change my mins im playing it. Thanks rocksteady for making this
I've just pre-purchased Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Deluxe Edition for 99€ on PC.
2D - Deadshot Noodle - Harley Quinn  Murdoc - Boomerang Russel - King shark
We haven’t heard Superman’s voice?
Let's be honest, Batman probably has a contingency for this too
Avengers 2 is looking interesting
I'm still trying to understand how the Squad is going to fight the likes of Superman, GL, and Flash but still very excited.
If you pre ordered this game seek help
I know I may not get an answer, but what is the song playing in this trailer?
I can't help but feel that one of the reasons why the brainwashed Justice League members' powers are nerfed for the Suicide Squad to take down is that they're still actively fighting against Brainiac's mind control from within.
this game is gonna be better than that marvel avengers FLOP OF A GAME
This a great song
It is great to have the batman from the arkham games back but if he dies in this I am gonna be really ticked off
Guess all the talent left rocksteady, would make sense for this pile of garbage.
Why didn't they bring back CCH Pounder for Amanda Waller? Why is Cere from Star Wars in this?
This was actually the reason Batman created the Justice League. They operated on a sort of checks and balances system.  If say for example Brainiac were to brainwash a member of the Justice League, Superman had become exposed to red kryptonite, or the Red/Sinestro Lanterns had caused a member of the Justice League to go berserk, part of their training was to understand each other's weaknesses and exploit them, either incapacitating them (hopefully) and bringing them back to their senses, or as a last resort, put them down for good.
The song didn’t fit.
Gorillaz music.
Deltron the Funky Homosapien, the best part of this trailer. Period.
So can you tell me what's with the damage numbers popping up for. It looks so stupid and just adds more random stuff on screen! THIS GAME WILL FAIL BECAUSE THE SCREEN HAS WAY TOO MUCH STUFF ON IT. We can't see what's happening. Dosent feel cinematic with these stupid damage numbers popping up everywhere 🙄
HARLEY IS AN ICON
Holy crap, members of the justice league doing evil things? Who could have possibly imagined?
Buying this game only because they’ve got Clint Eastwood as the soundtrack
I bet the Superman boss will be unbeatable
I like how they used the song "Clint Eastwood" by Gorillaz. It really fits the Suicide Squad's nature.
Hey what's Cere Junda doing with suicide squad? 0:17
Sorry, WB marketing, you can't seduce me with a well-used Gorillaz track, I know this is just another live service game that I have no want nor need for.
W
Does Waller NOT understand that the League is being manipulated by Brainiac
king shark and captain boomerang will be the best characters I can already tell
song
Can't wait for this game and to hear the last Kevin Conroy Batman performance.
Ok this game might not flop the story good characters good voice actors good gameplay need some work though
Wow, i couldnt be any LESS interested in this game lol. This MIGHT have worked 3 or 4 years ago . but now? Nah guys ....  Spend so long developing something to chase a trend and by the time you finish it,  the trend is over lol.
Who else is gonna start crying when they play Batmans campaign?
Hey, rock study. I have a suggestion for you if you're going to make another game. Based off of this universe. I wonder if you could use your Batman from Batman Arkham nights. Since he becomes the Batman who laughs. You could have him taking over the Justice League. And him fighting against the suicide squad or. The group of robins like you had in Gotham nights. But have him playing as the villain. Being the Batman who laughs. I think it would make a really good storyline. And it would lineup chronologically with the Batman games.
1:21
This looks awesome
I’m so excited for this game, all I’m worried about is if it is going to have really bad bugs or glitches
clint eastwood is such a good song for this trailer. I didn't recognize it at first. Never thought i'd hear 2D in a trailer
1:44 the Just-Us League is coming?
1:16 Damn Captain Boomerang, you where told to kill the Flash, not destroy him
Harley Quin isnt hot enough
I feel that lady is in every game.......
i realy hope they add or reference Chato Santana aka El Diablo at some point
GORILLAZ IS RELEVANT AGAINW YEGHJDYTGHHEHEHEHEHAHAHA
YESSSS!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤
I will lose against batman on purpose, and then just close the game, and consider it as headcanon.
😱
Do you think they might show a cutscene showing how Brainiac corrupted the Justice League?
THIS TRAILER HAS NO REASON 2 GO THIS HARD LIKE THAT
alr but this trailer has no reason to be that hard tho
(0:00-0:43) you could say there's a imposter among us.
The flash fight is him gonna be extremely slow lmao calling it now, he should be able to kill you instantly but they will have some cheap Cop out 🤣 classic
Really really REALLY hope y’all don’t make me kill the Batman I grew up with, the Arkham series was perfection and I don’t think I can kill batman
Damn people really bashed on this
I bet there is gonna be an Aquaman DLC where you can recruit Black Manta to kill him has another corrupted hero
GORILLAZ
GORILLAZ
GORILLAZ
I’m so glad they used a gorillaz song for this game trailer!
The game looks awesome
I completely forgot Batman has scarecrows toxin and all of his moves.  We are screwed in the Batman boss. R.I.P Kevin, thanks for all the memories.
"He is the fastest man alive..... According to all his girlfriends" Ok, that was low but beautiful at the same time🤣
Best Moment of "GorillaZ"
Guys, they put gorillaz name on this, better not flop too hard
I’m getting this game for two reasons: 1. Kevin conroy 2. It actually looks good
D O A and also, only dead people are still listening to the gorillaz or get excited over them
1:46 I’m sorry is that nightmare Batman??   I guess he’s going to use the fear toxin I can’t wait for that boss fight
DOA
1:17
Why would I ever play a game that has:  - a woman  - a race-swapped token gary stu  - debra wilson - an emasculated strong male that is a shark gummy bear  - an antagonized HERO Superman  - a game that focuses more on john stewart than Hal Jordan  - and some noname australian criminal  ?
Wow, Kevin sounds a lot different
any1 only here 4 gorillaz
So sad to see that many clips and see only jumping on a rooftops. :(
Why does Amanda waller look like cere from fallen order?
I'm wondering if the voice actor for Boomerang also did the voice for Junkrat in Overwatch :)
“He’s the fastest man alive, according to all his girlfriends” was wild🤣
Despite what everyone hopes I do think we will actually kill the justice league because if batman expecially has killed people himself he would not be able to go on afterwards. In arkham knight we saw how he felt being responsible for someone dying. Now doing it himself even under brainiacs control is something arkham batman could not live with and I don't think they would do that to his character. But for all I know I could be wrong
Omg it’s Cere Junda for fallen order
You make a game with superheroes with a lot of powers, but you can SHOOT a gun. lol I hope its better than that otherwise it will be a flop, If I want to shoot Ill just play some fortnite for free
My question is ok there going against the justice league but yet we wont be able to play with batman superman wonderwoman 🤔
I did not come into a trailer for this game expecting Gorillaz to be playing…but I’ll take it 😄
Can’t wait to try it out
Not once we haven’t heard Superman voice
Was that joker that said aww come on at the end or is that just me?
Dude I don't wanna kill Arkham Batman, Kevin Conroy did so good as Batman and it's sad to see that we might have to kill off his batman
Boomerang “he the fast man alive according to all his girlfriend” they did right by boomerang 😂😂😂
What is the music
This is definitely a multiverse thing he says "burn this earth down"💀
Del The Funky Homosapien won't save this game.
This doesn't look as bad as people keep making it out to be. Hoooooonestly I'm not interested to play it (yeah I know) but I can see people enjoying it.  Biggest criticism I've seen is the shooter gameplay, but Gotham Knights wasn't that and people still destroyed that game so what do they have to lose from trying a shooter approach?
I feel like this story should of been the conclusion to a suicide squad 3 game trilogy. The only people we know is Batman and Harley. No build up to Super man and the league. Essentially when Arkham was so grounded. You mean to tell me the Justice League gets got in their first outing? I hope I’m wrong.
Everyone from 2009 to 2015: We want Rocksteady to make a Superman or Justice League Game!!  WB Games: "Gamers, we've been listening!! Well we've heard some of what you had to say! Something about Justice League, was it? We have the rights to the characters you know & love, but we decided that you'd like to play as other characters you don't care about at all.
CLINT EASTWOOD? I haven't heard that song in a good minute. Yet I still remember all the lyrics.
Looks boring AF
Only buying this out of respect for Kevin Conroy’s final performance
This game looks like utter garbage with a DC wrapper placed around it...
I really love this Superman and Batman design
Clint Eastwood 🔛🔝🗣🗣🗣🗣
One major problem with this plot already… Superman could literally end this game before it even starts tbh 💀
They better have a damn good reason why the flash just doesn’t kill them instantly
Suicide squad is over rated.
I will only play this if it free
0:17 Cere?
Wow, Sugar Baby has done some excellent work for the looks of it
Team Harley Quinn 👇
Wonder woman kind of looks like sasha banks when she has the flash tied up!
CLINT EASTWOOD OMG
Please Video Game Gods, LET THIS BE GOOD!! 🙏
Suicide squad is better with Jared Leto's joker 🃏🃏🃏
Next month?!!! Hole. Lee. Cow!!!
Seems promising
As much as everyone is very negative about this game I love looter shooters and been craving a new one after Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands disappointed me so I’m looking forward to this game although I don’t have much expectations since the most important of looter shooters is the endgame and they haven’t showed anything about it so far. Still don’t get why the game is getting so much hate when the gameplay so far looks really fun.
They'd rather have made a Green Arrow sequel that includes Death Stroke and Bruce Wayne-related villains.
I can’t wait to play it ❤❤❤😅😅😅
Why'd they remove the gold outline on the batsuit? The Rebirth vibes were sick
Gameplay:😴  Music:🗿
Batman get shot in the head Wonder Woman is good tho. Women cant be bad in 2024 woke BS!
you cant beat rocksteady facial graphics
I am sad that Kevin's last game is this trash clusterf**k.  Having this game as ONLINE only kills it very fast. This is anthem 2.0.... SAD...
Seems like thw scarecrow is in it with the evil burning batman
“He’s the fastest man alive..! According to all his girlfriends!” 😂 I think this Captain Boomerang is better than the DC movies today.
i dont think that suicide squad can defeat superman maybe superman become good after sometime i hope that justice league will not going to be dead ❤
I don't think I have the balls to kill batman cause I love batman he is my favourite superhero and to be conroys last permonance makes it even harder
I’ll enjoy hearing Kevin one last time!
This will be epic!! When the heroes break free, things go bad for Brainiac
The first 20 seconds I hear among us........  I'm immediately buying the game
Wait why is justice league evil
I just purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition for Xbox I'm very hyped for this game
#arkhamoriginsremaster
IS EVERYONE IGNORING THE FACT GORILLAZ IS IN THE TRAILER
PLEASE...PLEASE...PLEASE....don't be like the "Midnight Suns" game...or "The Avengers" game..........don't adopt that stupid system for the Suicide Squad" game...........it is a stupid way to play........DONT DO IT!!!
Justice League all wearing their iconic costumes except Wonder Woman who is all covered up and now wears pants. Gtfo
Please release this as a movie, with this same screenplay,   If you release this kind of screen play it will beat the marvel
Batman in the firey form whatever u wanna call it reminds me of the end of Arkham night so seeing him use fear toxins would be crazy cool
Some wise thug once said that"You don't fight batman, you survive Batman"
Music the flash
0:13 "among us"😱😱😱
Clint eastwood is such a good song
Why is green lantern black

youtube consoles e jogos brasil eng leo batman arkham knight hogwarts legacy injustice 2 mortal kombat 9 injustice gods among us mortal kombat 11 shadow of war mad max game batman arkham origins lego batman 3 beyond gotham gotham knights f.e.a.r.3
The plot had potential. But the gameplay looks like crap
WTF  the darkest knight
Meanwhile I’m freaking about about a cinematic Gorillaz song 😂😂
I still don’t get it, the green lantern ring should’ve detected when John used lethal force against an innocent but here is it and he’s been using it to do who knows what harm
I have the game pre ordered i cant wait for it to Release
The gameplay looks like 2010
1:16 Greatest disrespect of all time 😆
I detest WB for not allowing Rocksteady to make a Superman game. Can’t wait for them to bought out again.
Who’s voicing Batman now that Kevin Conroy’s dead.
wait is superman modelled after henry cavill?
travis touchdown wants to have a word with the person who named this trailer lmao
This looks cool. The Suicide Squad have been receiving some attention lately, and it's great.
"He's the fastest man alive. At least thats what his girlfriends say." Nah, that's just Reverse Flash jerking Barry off so fast you can't see him, to humiliate Barry of course >.>'
I highly doubt they're going to actually kill the Justice League. They're probably going to disable the mind control. Otherwise this is going to be the weakest Justice League of all time lol
Guys can we just be excited why are all the videos i see for this game negative it looks fun! Please just enjoy the visuals an the cool looking fighting
WB will copyright strike your channel just for disagreeing with this game.
I think that option failed the moment lamiac showed up
😱😱🔥
It's crazy that this game was announced 3 years ago. I can't wait to finally play it.
Why is that one black chick literally the same as cere from the Star Wars games.
There’s no way these four dumbasses are gonna kill the justice league
💩
Listen carefully, CW Flash theme is playing in the BGM.
WOW
The Boys?
Why'd they make Captain Boomerang a jew?
This is the last place I expected to hear Clint Eastwood but damn
Honestly WHY WHY they decided to use the suicide squad as the main roster? The Justice League characters look amazing (eh maybe not Flash...) Why couldn't we have a Justice League game instead in the Arkham Universe? Imagine you're playing as Batman, you get capture or require help and then you switch to Superman and get to free roam as him in Metropolis
1:45    I Can't Believe They Did It Demon Batman is Confirmed 😱💯💯🔥🔥. Thank goodness I made the sound track for this my Album called Midnight Sparkle for Suicide Squad Kills Justice League Track
GORILLAZ !!!!
Gorillaz
Justice league beats jokers Harley Quinn’s  team and saves there’s lives that’s how it should be like 👍
Idk I feel Batman might break brainiacs control
This looks amazing but ain't no way they beating superman💀
😊
how boring and uninspired
saturated of this hero stuff, specially after a wave of bad movies😮‍💨
Rocksteady: please wb can we PLSSS make u an awesome justice league single player story driven adventure game  Wb: no do a fortnite inspired online suicide squad game instead
What BS.  They wouldn't stand a chance.
This looks like absolute garbage
I am interested in the story.
I ignored this game for a long time but I might give it a chance
This game looks wild. Hope it’s good.
Let´s be honest here. They would never defeate Batman and the Flash. Good Luck using Green Kryptonit against a rouge Superman. The Squad would be dead in a few seconds.
Best trailer the game has put out so far
1:40 This is how it happened. This is how the Batman died
1:40 This is how it happened. This is how the Batman died
2 February we can finally playing soon
lol no
Hope the Batman leak isn’t true 😭
This looks bad. Just like Gotham Knights. Couldve made a Batman game where he had to take down good and bad guys.
It's just hilarious how we are supposed to believe they could actually defeat ANY of the justice league
They wouldn’ t have the balls to make us kills Kevin Batman… I would not be able to do this
I’m glad to see John Stewart, i’m tired of Hal Jordan
Did you nightmare batman
Where lego jurassic world 2
Faster than doom gameplay more colour palette than guardians of the galaxy
Awesomeness and hype for it. Just curious why John Stewart green lantern over Hal Jordan or Guy Gardner even Kyle green lantern too.
This is Arkham Batman we are dealing with here. Yea, Batman's boss fight is going to be an absolute nightmare to fight.
Do not pre-order this game, just purchase it on release.
We want a Arkham style game not this overwatch garbage
Looks fun, actually! The use of Clint Eastwood by Gorillaz is great and Batman being here is awesome! But, i hope we don't kill Batman. I mean, from two people Batman never fought in the Arkham series, a different versions of someone he did, and someone who he always beat in one hit, it doesn't feel justified to kill such a beloved version of the character that way.
i am so buying this when does it come out
whats the name of the song?
Am I only one noticing this Lady 0:17 from COD modern warfare? Is that actress same?
READ CAREFULLY Captain Boomerang throws a boomerang decaptitating Barry and the Boomerang gets stuck in Bruce's Throat and everyone else gets pissed at boomer for that while Boomer is celebrating killing flash and Bruce with his dying words free of braniacs control tells them there's a lazurus pit and tells them to throw Barry in there
This game deserves whats coming. I hope rocksteady shuts down after this, they arent what they used to be.
I'm not playing a game with a Battlepass tied into progression, no matter how much I liked the Arkham games
My best advice, eat it. Do not release this. It’s going to kill your company.
I don't care, there's no way they are killing batman
The plot is trash
I still don't think this is the arkham JL
Well this game is going downhill faster then the flash 😅
So the whole story is leaked and all the characters get killed off, ridiculous.
0:14
this is going to underperform.
I feel like people are over reacting to the leaks, we don’t even know how it ends so somehow some comic nonsense will bring everyone back to life probably. This is even more likely since James Gunn said there will be more Arkham games, which is going to be hard if every character stays dead.
there is still time to remake the game
Getting saints row reboot vibes
I plan to #SaveTheJusticeLeague by never buying this trash and pretending it doesn't exist
I love the Arkham games so much, so sad to see where they went with this 😢 I guess it's to be expected when you work with a company like "sweet baby inc"
Bye-Bye Batman😞
Anyone else here after seeing the recent leaks?
Don't preorder. You can have classic outfits with mods for free.
❤❤❤❤❤
1:41 fun fact:In this scene harley is about to kill someone,and who's that person you may ask?   **Batman.**
They can make the most lucrative trailers possible but keep "the day after" in mind, they had really good trailers and they were a flat out scam.
Backing from vanguard, Black Rock and story rereading from Sweet baby no thank you.
Those Flash/Arrow themes thrown in there just add to the epicness!!
WOW THIS GAME LOOKS AMAZING CANT WAIT TO SPEND ALL MY MONEY ON WEAPON SKINS
"Batman, Green Lantern, Flash, Superman... Characters you can't play as!!"
No single player on release is insane.
00:14 Among us? Amongus amogus
Can't wait!!!
Sincerely depressed Kevin Conroy's final performance will be in this dogshit.
Looks like trend-chasing, uninspired live service crap. Pass.
The song goes hard in this trailer!🎵🔥🎵🔥🎵
After reading the leaks why just why would you do this??
How tf are they meant to kill Batman like this ain’t no normal Batman it’s Arkham batman
Ek number bidu
it seems Gotham knights cared more about batman and his legacy more thrn this game
1:38 nightmare Batman!!!
Travis Touchdown in the Suicide Squad now???
Cant wait to kill the Flash with fucning GUNS...
I noticed that they showed boss fights with Green Lantern and Flash and other super heroes, but they didn’t show boss fights with Batman, in the scene with Batman they showed them lying down
I'm still hesitant on this game I hope it's good though
Knightmare Batman is one of the grratest designs ever.

As a Gorillaz fan, hearing the Clint Eastwood song in this trailer puts a smile on my face, evan at 1:56 0:58 "You think you're a team now?" Man, that line even coming from the late Kevin Conroy (R.I.P.) gives me goosebumps. Even tho' I no longer have an Xbox nor that I owned a Playstation? I'm gonna enjoy watching the heck out of the gameplay videos out this to hear Kevin Conroy's voice as Batman one last time.
I hate to say it.. but the whole thing looks like "Barbie Squad: Kill the Justice League forever"
Clint Eastwood wood is the perfect song for the Suicide Squad
the fastest man alive joke is crazy 💀
"he's the fastest man alive, according to his gf's" 😂😂😂
Why is Amanda Waller, looking like Cere kinda
I think Captain Boomerang will be fun.
Does anyone know the song in the background
Bro fear Batman??
Jedi chose the wrong side
music feels like flash intro song somewhere
The guy singing the song Midway through the video sounds like Del the Funky Homosapien mixed with Gorillaz
This game looks awesome
0:14
Вопрос. Если это вселенная Аркхэм, то почему дэдшот поменял цвет кожи?
If they decide to add more bosses in the future I think it would be cool if they had Aquaman riding the Kraken and you had to fight the kraken as well as Aquaman
How about a justice league game?
"He is the fastest man alive, according to all his girlfriends" this had me dying.
So they can’t give us a JL game to use the characters? Like who have the idea of using kinda lamé characters to kill the JL. In Arkham city Batman essentially KO Harley in 1 hip toss. How can they possibly work? This is such a cash grab it’s sad. We could’ve had kevin voice a final game as a playable Batman but instead we get Injustice 2.5
So, let me get this straight... instead of getting to play as The Justice League, I get to play as... The Suicide Squad? That's so stupid - what a missed opportunity! Pass!
Is this Fornite?
Waiting for the day when you will be ashamed and release Gotham Knights' 60FPS. They don't know how to do a job as well as other developers and use the Series S as an excuse.  Even Marvel's Avengers can reach 60FPS
Ngl I’m aware what the title says but I hope we don’t actually have to kill the justice league
I jus know batmans finna be the hardest boss fight gonna be a pain
Mortal kombat classic collection plase 😊
If I have to kill Kevin Conroys Batman I’ll never forgive rocksteady
Where is your contengincy plan now?
So I think I found a big plot hole 🤣😂
Anyone knows the song ?
Don't be a hero🤣
Flash BGM is🔥🔥
Another game sweet baby inc probably ruined
Rest in Peace, Kevin Conroy. 💔🦇      ... and Xbox One.🥲💸
This looks good. I don’t know why people are complaining so much
Boooooooooo using poor advertisements to push your trash game. The charter design is terrible for all the charters you shown. The flash looks a teenager that has never hit puberty. John Stewart looks ok. Batman has gotten a huge down grade since Arkham Knight. Superman is not Superman in this game. Also why are having to kill the very thing that made you popular being Batman.
I've a feeling the gameplay is gonna be repetitive and boring
This game still isnt out? Yeah I think i lost interest about 4 years ago
I really hope this game is actually good
What's the song for the trailer?
As long as it’s not $70,$60,$50$40 I’ll check it out
Will there be Pvp Mode?
Was that the darkest knight or am i tripping
why is this 1 second clip of superman the hardest part of this entire trailer 1:01
I already know who I’m maining hints “I like fast character” (not flash)
Hearing kevin conroy's voice gave me chills, cant wait for the game to finally release and RIP kevin conroy 🕊️❤️
why are there only five members in this justice league..?
Not a DC fan, but this trailer was beautifully designed and hyped with one of the best songs by Gorillaz
1:47 This is Deja Vu. This isn’t her first time fighting a mind controlled Superman
So this is a video game
How many times is flash gonna be nerfed lol. He’s standing still in all these shots😂. If this was realistic, flash and Superman would be impossible to kill.
If there’s 3 characters that I wan once this game, it’s these 3 and these 3 to help the Suicide Squad:  1. Deathstroke, he’s someone who utilizes his sword, his power staff which allows him to shoot laser beams whiles fighting close range and guns and grenades. For skins, I was thinking of his Arkham Origins appearance from 2013, his Injustice look and his suit from My Adventures With Superman. For dialogue, have him reference Arkham origins and Arkham Knight.  2. Red Hood, Now even though Jason Todd is an anti hero and was a villain turned anti hero by the end of Arkham Knight, I feel like he should be in the game because of his use of his dual pistol, sniper rifle and flash bangs. I also hope for skins that he has his Arkham Red Hood suit and Arkham knight suit from when he was working with Scarecrow and his look from Injustice 2. If he has dialogue, maybe reference his time in Arkham Knight and how he became Red Hood and decided to kill Black Mask.  3. Vigilante, after watching Peacemaker, I was hooked on the show not just for John Cena but because of Vigilante AKA Adrian Chase. I liked his look from the show and it made me now want him in Suicide Squad. He not only utilize firearms like in the show but also would want to see gameplay where he uses close range combat with his sword or machete? (I need help knowing if it’s either one of those). Anyway. I would like to play as him and for alternate skins, I was thinking of his look from Arrow, his 2009-2010 comic look and maybe have the character’s actor, Freddie Stroma, return to the role to voice him and maybe have jokes and references from the show.
Love to hear Gorillaz in a video game trailer
Anyone else think Amanda Waller looks just like Debra Wilson from mad tv 😂😂
What is the name of the song they do they use in the background?
Game is already ruined by sweet baby inc lol
Now this is the trailer they should’ve went for looks promising and fun  The green lantern battle. Wow
Song name?
no Deathstroke?
This game is looking to be dead on arrival. Arkham Knights trailers has millions of views. Look at the views for these trailers lol
Dang. This looks so generic gameplay wise. Like any other live service team up third person shooter. I hope I'm wrong. I enjoy the Arkham trilogy and want this one to be good too. Like why does Harley seem to be leading the team? Why did they go with her awful movie look? Why is only Wonder Woman not mind controlled? I'm smelling the blood in the water.
Man this game looks INSANE!!! I just wish they decided to make a Superman only game, that would have been cooler, but reguardless imma get it.
Too bad the gameplay is CRAAAAP
This is very disappointing the Arkham series is my favorite favorite games of all time to go from that to just a cash grab y’all did not learn nothing from the avengers game
Sounds like the cws flash title music playing over gorrilaz
I am excited to hear Kevin Conroy voice Batman one final time . I think his bossfight will be epic and hard. RIP Kevin Conroy 😢
Did i hear cw's flash theme song?
Flop
Glad to see Batman still has his nightmare form from Arkham Knight  I hope they don't kill him off because Conray sadly died
If we get a dlc I want the characters to be peacemaker killer frost  black manta  and deathstroke
🤷‍♂️ok
This sucks, I could do better
Fighting Batman will be crazy.
Why? Who asked for this?
so what kind of game is it? single player or like an online Battle Royale? I cannot tell
Looks way better then i thought it would
I don't get why the song is Clint Eastwood tho
Batman’s gonna use scarecrows fear toxin
Please outline the improvements that were accomplished due to the delay.
You know what I want to see and I’m sure plenty of others do too is ps5 support for Batman Arkham knight!!
I hope it’s not a let down, looks button mashy.
**Superman has entered the chat**
I just wish that Batman's boss fight to not have a life bar or an actual fight, Instead he chases and stalks us(ambushes as well) throughout the game continuously maintaining constant fear from him, that would be awesome.
Wait isn’t that the chick from Jedi Survivor??
This game is going to blow
Yàrulam pradeep tweet paathu vanthinga 😊❤
NIGHTMARE BATMAN????
I will wait another 3 years for this game to release.
Why is the flash just standing still and getting shot?
Its weird I would’ve thought batman would have a contingency plan since hes so prepared
Who are all here.? Aftet Pradeep tweet..
Excited to see all of the cinematics for this game!
Vanakkakam Tamil boys
Bigboss 7 Tamil ❤❤ pradeep Antony 👈😍🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gorillaz Clint Eastwood?! That’s awesome and my one of my favorite songs Literally give me goosebumps 😅
After pradheep tweet😂
Is it even POSSIBLE for a bunch of CRIMINALS to save the world? Will we even get the chance to even PLAY THIS GAME, FINALLY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!😡😎
Pradeep Antony promoting suicide squad 😅
Pradeep
I gotta be hyped for this game, so much! But the leaks make me doubt it. This game could be so good, but I’m so scared that it’s just gonna be another looter shooter
Man the leaks showed a really cool and funny story that ends with Flash traveling back in time to fix everything, but why did they had to add a battle pass and Live service stuff?
Is this going to be a primarily single player or multi-player focused game?
Pradeep antony twitt after
Fear toxin batman looking sick as always
Pradeep. ....😂
Pradeeep Antony ❤️‍🔥
Where black Adam
Better be it alternative universe storyline 😂
பிரதீப் ஃபேன்ஸ் 👍
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag I'm useless but not for long The future is coming on 🔥
00:07 starts with Justice League's showcase part when you unlock/beat the members. I presume that's the real order of the boss fights: Flash > Green Lantern > Batman > Superman with Wonder Woman of course helping you along the way which makes the entire fight a bit more realistic.   Fingers crossed for some hidden characters and Easter eggs pointing to a Superman game, it would be a shame to waste such a great model. I had no doubt Rocksteady would be on point with models, graphics and environment, hopefully the story and gameplay will be good as well.
Very similar to the guardians of the galaxy  game. Looks good.
Nightmare Batman goes hard ngl
Batman and Flash will always be my favorite 😂❤
Arkham asylum to this?? How the mighty have fallen
This is gonna be dogshit.  I hope not, but if I'm not excited, I can't be disappointed, right? ;-)
I hope this has the same feel as the Guardian of the Galaxy Game. If yes, please take my money.
suicide squad raised to power 2 can stand Superman
Dawg, I don't think we're actually killing the heroes.
I don't wanna kill arkham batman or superman neither 🥺
Wtf was that
People without powers defeat people with power all the time so it's believable
WAS THAT THE DARKEST KNIGHT VERSION OF BATMAN???
0:41 THE ASLUME
That Super smirk...  01:55
I ain't happy by gorillaz is a surprisingly well fitting song for this trailer.
Looks so disappointing
I hope the entire game doesn’t take place on the city streets and they can go into iconic locations. I saw Arkham but still. Not only that I hope one mission you can play as a member of the justice league to help the squad like in the end. Would be so badass.
The gameplay in this is actually looking pretty good. I'm curious though if this will have single player, online multiplayer and couch co-op. I'm glad that Suicide Squad is getting more attention in games besides the movies.
Using Clint Eastwood by Gorillaz in this trailer just works so well.
John Stewart  is officially the most  visible and popular member of the Justice league that has not been seen in live action , HBO max Lanterns show will change all that
Batman has to be an unbeatable boss…. Supes should be aswell unless we have kryptonite but if we don’t superman should be a run away while you can mission and Batman should be a fight that is unwinnable but gets interrupted and that’s what saves us bc an evil Batman would have them dead before they got to room he was in and superman is just as bad
On a trailer dubbed no more heroes really missed a trick with using the song of the same name by the stranglers, tbh it fits the archaic nature better too, ( yeah yeah I know umbrella academy used it's first but my opinion stands )
Bro.. Batman is a MASTER TACTICIAN. He is well-read, educated (5 degrees, with Chemistry and Engineering degrees among them), ELITE NINJA (League of shadows), government-feared entity because of his resources and once sought after by Order of The Owls/League of Shadows(blackmailed to join)/Justice League(Prefers to be On-Call)/Lantern-Appointed  HE GOES TOE TO TOE WITH Superman, HE EVENS odds against him by understanding his opponent; THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT A MERE AVERAGE HUMAN WITH AVERAGE IQ??  HE WAS THE ONLY JL member who had contingency plans on contingency plans to defeat OWN ALLIES if they gone rogue. HE DEFINITELY knows his enemies.  HE WAS APPOINTED WHITE LANTERN!!  HE WAS SERVICED AND SOUGHT AFTER BY DARKSEID, HE IS THE ONLY JL MEMBER WHO OUTSMARTED DARKSEID AT HIS OWN GAME!  This guy MOVES FASTER THAN BULLETS as a human who prefers to not have superpowers despite being offered. ALL IN ARMOR TOO, mind you.  He lives in a CRIME-INFESTED city as an Elite. HE KNOWS his enemies. HE knows of people and is always tinkering on new gadgets to not succumb in battle.
Thanks for shoehorning in a single player mode at the last minute Rocksteady.
isn’t that cere from star wars?
It's a fukn game wtf..... hahahaha oooh God!
Wait, Rocksteady is still alive????
Coolest shark king desing till thia day
Really really really hope Batman is going to be the final boss fight.
Ayo the Gorillaz in the back go hard tho
I don't know about this game man. The whole online thing doesn't go with me. But I guess I might get it just because it's Kevin Conroys last time as Batman I'll wait for reviews though.
I cant convince myself all of them combined can take on The Flash alone let alone Superman as well
Why is dead shot a dark in this one? 🌚
Please release this with a single player story mode. Ideally local co-op but that doesn't exist anymore. But this can't just be an online hide from the big bad and take your pot shots experience. Needs more than that.
Se nota de lejos que es una porqueria.
This game can be incredible banger or a disaster, nothing between.
Зеленский банить комба 10
Make this game harder dev
I'm not into all the super hero movies some are great don't get me wrong. But this looks amazing! 👌 👏  I want to know what game modes they have. And how they implemented the online player aspect before I spend 70 on a game. If there is many game modes to choose from as well as a campaign then I'm definitely interested to say the least. I pre ordered Diablo 4 and I said that'd be the last game I ever pre ordered but I'm definitely considering lol
why does flash just stand there
This looks way better than the last gameplay trailer. No more shooting random purple circles! Lest gooo
Batman using fear toxin in the boss fight like he was using in the end of arkham knight is a nice little callback and kind of confirming that he is using the toxin as a weapon now.
Are they mixing up the cw flash theme and clint Eastwood for this trailer?
Bro what’s up Cere
These trailers are too good
All I know is.. the story’s gonna be amazing. Anyone who thinks less is just hating. You could say all you want bout the gameplay but the story’s gonna be great. Even then I still like the gameplay. I have almost a lot of problems with it but it still looks like an amazing crazy shooting-melee traversing world that you can switch between 4 characters in
The gameplay looks so bad
Oh
After playing the alpha, I can definitely say the storyline is going to be crazy
Damn that was actually cool
0:26 I bet this will be the moment he breaks free of his brainwashing as he stops himself from breaking his number one rule and the gun in his hand reminds of Jeo Chill and once he’s free he will team up with the squad alongside Wonder Woman and gives his contingency plans to the squad to use against Superman, Flash and Green Lantern and Superman will be the final one to free before the squad and the League team up to take down brainiac
I can’t wait to stream this baby in twitch 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏
30 fps again....
This is so tuff
0:17 hello Cere Junda
gah damn  this game looks like it will be lots of fun!
We could have gotten a Superman game by Rocksteady but instead WB forced us a Suicide Squad game where we kill the JL. Just great.
Is that Del the funky homosapiens rapping?
Yal sold me with "Clint Eastwood".
The music is a crime against humanity
I Hoped George Newbern is Voicing Superman in this Dark And Gritty DC Story
It’s Been Confirmed That Jason Issacs Will Be Voice Acting as Brainiac In The Upcoming Video  Game from Warner Bros
1:37 is Batman using fear toxins 🧐
So disappointing that y’all are siding with a genocide
0:55 CW FLASH AND ARROW THEME 💚❤️ WHAT!??!?!?!?!?!?!
People put a lot of negativity into this game, but in terms of its story, characters and the scope of the action and the idea, it looks really fun.
I wanta be excited but live service? idk
Still requires an internet connection to play single player. Yeah I'll pass
Wow... this was incredible. I hope they turned things around!
They need to do more of those Dev comentaries to get the hype up for this. IDK it still seems weird.
Let’s pray this game doesn’t end up like Gotham Knights I really want it to succeed
Bro we better see Superman go badass
Damn I haven’t heard that last song in the trailer 😅 long long time
How stupid is that black lady in the trailer there clearly getting mind controlled 🤦
CARALHOOOOOOOW QUE TRAILER FOI ESSEEEEE???????????? EU FIQUEI MALUCAAAA
1:56 Is it just me, or is Superman *crying* here?
Does this soundtrack come with the game - I’m sold !!
Ok, you got me this time! I will give this a chance! ❤ Fantastic trailer and perfect music!
Is that the same batman from the Arkham games? (Asking because I think that was nightmare batman from Arkham knight.)
Finally we get our first look at Brainiac
Bruce unlocked his Devil Trigger.
This game is going to be game of the year.        -No one
Gotham knights but suicide squad version?
*Inhale* “I AIN’T HAPPY, I’M FEELING GLAD!”
Gameplay wise it’s looks like an other Gotham Knights game and I bet Wonder Woman is gonna be some kind of training menu that gives you more skills or something . I’m not buying it until they do like 20% discount but I still want to see the story
Instant like just for the music
The trailers for this game are fleeek clean bruh. Marketing is on point with delivering the hype hopefully the game will too
If the game is bad, ill sue
i played the alpha of this game and its really fun by yourself and with a group[ and graphics are nice
meh, is still  a live service, dont care
1:21 GOOOOOD WASSS SOOO GOOOD
Fear Toxin Batman is about to be the best fight in the game
what happened to Batman 1:46
Don't like seeing this the JL turning evil and killing people especially for Batman.
Wait is that Nightmare Batman
The Batman from Arkham Knight ending The Nightmare Batman!!!
We get to see Nightmare Batman again, huh? Very cool.  😎👍
Did Superman take the emperor's Tadpole?
I CANT WAIT!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I really want to see Batman in action
Trailer music?? Anyone?
I don't know what's worse fighting Batman in pure darkness knowing fully well he can get The jump on you anytime he wants to or The fact he's using The fear gas to jumpscare you out of nowhere or the fact he has a gun now and can use It on the enviroment to distract you, seriously If The don't make The Batman bossfight terrifying i'm NEVER playing a DC game ever again (unless it's The Arkham series)
Damn! I love that Gorillaz soundtrack. Really rimes with the theme of the video game! ALL ABOUT THE VILLAINS!
Brainiac is a great story arch
From a story and cinematic aspect this game looks incredible. Can't say the same for the gameplay. But I'm definitely interested in the campaign.
All I’m gonna say about this game is déjà vu
I really hate the disrespect towards Arkham Batman. Dude finished his trilogy by overcoming mind control so he doesn’t kill and then gets mind controlled and kills off screen.. great writing guys, real good job there.
I'm already calling, the flash fight will be bad
Looks sick, can't wait!
Garbage
this game going to BOMB for sure like gotham knights
Bad call to sync gun shots with the musc... Remember the last time suicide squad did that lol?
I will say since it’s connected to the Arkham verse I thought Batman would be the one league member who isn’t under mind control and fighting with the squad
Imagine how dope this would be if it was a justice league game
I know it probably won’t happen, but I really hope we get aquaman DLC.  Shazam and MM might be too similar to Superman but imagine having a boss arena in Atlantis where you have to fight aquaman while holding off sea monsters!
Would’ve been more rewarding to have a justice league game or Superman game. Even follow the DCAU, Batman, Superman then JLU. I hope WB learns and I do hope fans get a great game.
I still wanna know how any of them stand a chance against Superman…my theory is that Wonder Woman helps them throughout the story
So amazing to hear Kevin Conroy ❤ RIP and thank you for this.
whats the title of the trailer song?
looks like it takes place on one big open map . thats a hard pass from me
This game is going to be so bad. The only saving grace is the story
Gorillaz and Suicide Squad. Two of my fave things I never thought would work so well together.
I would have preferred batman beyond Arkham over this, at least I can replay the arkham games
GORILLAZ
This game looks better and better every trailer. The closed Alpha was amazing.
All the positive comments about this have got to be bot accounts, right?
Dead on arrival
Fortnite? 🙄
Gonna be honest, seeing all the stuff about Batman kind of sucks for me. I mean I know it was obvious in the Arkham community what happened at the end of knight, but there was also still some mystery as it was never confirmed what happened. I wish they would’ve saved the Batman stuff for the game so we could somewhat be surprised as we learn what truly happened that night. I guess they need the marketing though
After playing the alpha my only complain is the alien designs look mid but the rest looks amazing and plays fast and action pack
Interesting. Also I love the use of the song Clint Eastwood by Gorillaz from their first album back in 2001.
If only they lose the trunks on Superman (smh)
I genuinely believe that if this game is just single-player, and isn’t focused on a battlepass or live service, it will be a serious candidate for GOTY 2024.
I hope they dont kill Batman and disrespect to Arkhamverse and Kevin Conroy
After 8 years it's officially confirmed that Bruce Wayne started using fear gas.
Espanta viejas el videojuego
The Suicide Squad must kill only Brainniac, he's got mind control powers. If they kill Brainniac, they will save Justice League and stop invasion.
Can't be the only that forgot this was a thing
Hmm I don't trust trailers because they can mask all the BS but I will say I will definitely look up all the cut scenes once I hear the people I trust opinions on the game.
Give us deathstroke
I love seeing how the reception changed so much glad to see more people excited for this game
Knightmare Batman, you have already lost.
A much better trailer! I’m still skeptical and concerned though
Would rather see a Superman game
Where is multiversus
This trailer still gives me hope for this game edit: thanks for the likes ig
What are those comments?
From Arkham Knight to Darkest Knight
Batman: "You think you're a team now?"   Loved to hear Kevin Conroy's voice once again! R.I.P
This game took 4 years to be released but at least it looks dope,🔥 it will be bittersweet to hear Kevin Conroy ad Batman one last time
no more than 10 hours of gaming a day
I LOVE YOU DC♥
Trashh
1:18 Is this Batman tech or fear toxin?
Wonder Woman actually gets the "Thor carry the team" roll this time! Not Superman, and it makes sense that mind control tech doesn't affect WW because she's a God
Looks bad
OFFLINE mode on the way 2024
The aslume
The problem that this game may have isnt due to Rocksteady, but Warner demands on what to put on the game. Lets just hope this game rocks
Good trailer, horrible music.
Is that the Darkest Knight?
I wonder if they got George Newburn  as Superman for this game it would have been cool if they got Susan Eisenberg for Wonder Woman so that they we could have DCAU trinity re united one last time since this is Kevin Conroy’s last time he will voice Batman.
❤😊😮. Cool to see look a like SuperCena in the game lol 😂. And great video guys.
This is going to be another Gotham Knights or Marvel's Avengers.
I love the gorillaz song choice
Looks awful, expectations couldn't be lower at this point
So hopefully this games gives us some answers about the ending of Arkham Knight
this game is DOA... it could have been so good. but warner bros decided to not make it good!!
It's not going to be surprising when this turns out to be a simulation to prepare for the justice league going rogue.. but I think I'd prefer it that way.. don't really want to kill Arkham bats
Quite a turn around from the first gameplay showing. Hopefully this game delivers
I'm so excited to see the knightfall batman
I don’t see these four being able to kill any of the JL aside from Batman. Should be fun to see how they pull it off.
The gameplay doesn’t look stellar, but the story does. It’s cool that they brought in Nightmare Batman. Can’t wait to see how that plays out.
Wow. Some many good comments for this mediocre game.WB surely took all their bots here
Hope they don't make superman an easy fight, he'd literally wipe the floor with all of them
Gorillaz,niiiice!
What's that rap song in the trailer?
I was not ready to be hearing gorillaz in the background
The question is,are we going to kill the justice league  or trying to find how to wake them up?
Why are demon bats arms so skinny?
For once wonder woman is a really good sided character
I thought I couldn't get more hyped for this game. But seeing the boss fight's in the trailer, I NEED IT NOWWWWW!!!!!!!
0:59 Hearing Conroy’s voice again gets me so emotional. I can’t wait to see his final iconic performance as the dark knight, RIP.❤️
Damn, they even got Jedi in this video game! lol
0:14 what 😨😨
Love how some parts of the music sound similar to the Flash's (CW) theme.
At first I wasn't 100% sure they were using Arkham Batman's voice but it's confirmed at 1:00 .  R.I.P. Kevin Conroy
*Batman with fear toxin*  Oh, we are so screwed…
Shame Wonder Woman isn’t brainwashed as well. A full evil justice league would of been nice
I just know Rocksteady employees roll their eyes at work daily knowing this could’ve been a Superman game. How disappointing.
BATMAN KNIGHTMARE
The last time we will hear Kevin Conroy as Batman in this game.
IS THAT NIGHTMARE BATMAN FROM THE REAL ENDING OF ARKHAM KNIGHT?!?!
0:17 guess she got tired of being a Jedi 😅😂
KNIGHTMARE BATMAN!!!!!! IT'S CANON!!!!! IM SOLD!!!!
This is Kevins last performance as the Dark Knight 🥺
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Hype trailer but the gameplay just isn’t selling it for me
It's giving me boys vibe
0:14 - AMONG US
0:59 Good to hear your voice, Kevin, for one last time.
the first thing I see, batman with a gun.
In the scene He actually shot the gun at harley after knocking her out but the heavily bruised flash pushed the bullet off at the last second. After that batman started beating flash to the pulp until he got a message from braniac that he wants flash alive, then 0:32 happens
0:06 put the playback speed to 0.25x you can see brainiac
Why is Wonder Woman not mind controlled.
mmm..... garbage!
We’re all screwed if we gotta go up against nightmare Batman💀😂😂😂
Looks cheap.🤣
If this game didn’t have the “always need to be online” aspect so that I can play it forever like some of my older classic games I’d say this is a must have but sadly u will never own this game. It’s only to rent for a few years.
Still not intrested
Initial news about this game has given me doubts. But I can’t deny that the trailer looks amazing and using Gorillaz for the music was unexpected, but very welcomed
Still hoping we get a Superman game.
Need more squad members to make it work cause those 4 with wonder woman help still going to get rimmed.
I like that they all have guns and not their own special abilities like in the movies and comics. What a lazy way of making a game of unique characters who had awesome abilities in the comics and movies
Was this supposed to come out last year?
DOA  Harley Quinn, Deadshot, King Shark, and Captain Boomerang (with a gun LOL) all flying around and shooting things.  This looks like a really bad loot n' shooter, and a far cry from the greatness of the Arkham Trilogy.   RIP Kevin Conroy, I'm sorry this was your last go as THE Batman.
This woulda been EPic & printed money had it just been Batman VS Justice League. ~Even now the cop out is the JLA are brainWashed. LAME! Why not just HAVE  Waller want to kill em cause shes Waller???  Worst part is this is Conroys last time as The Bat. ~There is hope for the future though as ArkhamOrigins had a great Batman and Dimagio's Joker was EPIC.
The boss battles look amazing especially the one with the Flash. Also gotta love the design for the Fear Toxin using Batman
I only like it because Gorillaz
Cool 😎
Can’t wait to see how arkham batman is portrayed
Ugh. The ugly Harley Quinn just ruins it.    Have they not learned anything from the GTA 6 trailer? 🤔
that’s not amanda waller. that’s cere😂😂😂😂😂
Also kinda funny how their supposed to be artifacts you can find that are supposed to detail whos still kicking,mia,or dead from villains to also heros
Gorillaz 😮😮😮
Sorry... too much shooting. This is not what I want out of a Rocksteady game.
Acaso es Batman de pesadilla 😯
1:23 he’s the fastest man alive but is standing in one spot with a barrier around him 😂
How not love seeing batman again❤
We must save them not kill them 😠
Going to be better than sm2 idc what anyone says, the arkham series was better than 1 & mm, now this vs sm2 id easily say this
Nightmare Batman looks like the Darkest Knight in this game. 😨
It looks like Crackdown with superheroes. Thanks, but no.
🟦🟥🟨0:47 Happy Birthday💫🎈🟡🎀🧨🍟🔷⭐🚩
That Harle skin looks terrible
I hope The Suicide Squad find a Way to free The Justice League so they all can stop Brainiac.
The game looks amazing! One final ride for Kevin Conroy’s Batman ❤
Hard pass
Is Batman using Fear Toxins?
Alright, the game looks pretty good in general, but I'm skeptical of their ability to really sell the Flash boss fight. We're shooting the fastest man alive (according to his girlfriends) with guns, and he's just sitting there behind a forcefield to be shot? They're going to have to do some serious writing gymnastics to sell that one.
Batman wipping out guns and his Arkham serie's nightmare final form means he gonna be doing some reverse-jumping for sure!
This looks sick.. Too much better than James gunn movie..  50% respect for my boy Arkham Batman❤
Why video's game suit fight and action scene are better than movies?
all fun and games until batman starts laughing
epic
Who wanted this to be a movie trailer
Still would of prefered a Superman game. Thanks executives...for not listening to fans
God, I can’t wait for this game. The green lantern boss fight looks absolutely sick, and this game has won my hype back.
Let us hope that this game will live up to its hype, because who doesn’t want to play the suicide squad ?
They have reworked this game so many times now hope this time it is good
If this really is a sequel to Arkham Knight no way there actually gonna kill then
Superman would be the tough one
ANOTHER ONE?! Are you going to put this out or not!? I feel like you spoiled the whole game....
batman knightmare ftw
I don't know what's scarier!!!!!!! Batman with a gun or Batman with fear toxin?!?!?!?!😨🤯
Can’t wait for the Batman boss fight even if we don’t stand a chance against him
Rocksteady definitely knows how to surprise as always after the Batman trilogy that is GOD the best thing they did I had faith in Suicide Squad kill The Justice League at first I was afraid of the computer service but seeing this it is a great improvement I hope it does well ( and the fact that it expands more and integrates more characters from the DC universe is magnificent 💙🤩💙)
I still don't know why some people are judging this. This looks amazing!!!! And oh wow, they're actually gonna reveal what the ending of Arkham Knight really meant!!!!!
DEAD GAME!
Internet required = dead game man 😂.
Arkham Batman with guns, I hope he’ll be the most unhinged villain ever give Kevin a great sendoff
I got the chills after seeing that Arkham night  bat creature I am definitely going replay the game series
This is what y'all should have gone with the first time lol
Still hope we can AT LEAST SAVE BATMAN
tbh i dont like harley quinns voice, her jokes sounds corny
They are going to fail more than... Well, they can't fail more than Gotham Shights, that was a critical mass of biological danger.But they will crash and burn HARD.
Can a good developer save what looks like a bad game with MTX and god knows what else? Well, we will see soon enough.
What happened Rocksteady. The combat in the Batman games was so good. This looks like generic shooter garbage from what little game play they showed.
Chooss your side Avengers or Justice League
This is how it happened, this is how Rocksteady died.
It can be the darkest knight oooooor nightmare batman ( hope it's the darkest knight )
THIS is the game they should make and let us play as the HEROES. They have never made a correct superman game! This could be it! Just reverse the roles.
The gorillaz singing but they can't beat arkham batman
Literally hype asf
Nightmare batman!!!!!!! I have to get the game now
As a Gorrilaz and A DC fan I will never feel more satisfied in my life.
🔥🔥‼️‼️🥳
😫
"Time for us bad guys to save the world"--- Every badass anti-hero
I got a feeling that there’s gonna be a plot twist at all this
Song is known for NBA 2K14
Gorillaz's Clint Eastwood is perfect fit for Suicide Squad..oh wow! looks like we're getting Nightmare Batman as well!
Clint Eastwood…
NIGHTMARE BATMAN IS A BOSS?!?! Oh Nah. They are Dead where they stand!
I'M SO HYPED
My Squad is ready for this 🙌
