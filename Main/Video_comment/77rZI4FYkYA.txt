We got covid while filming this which threw us for a bit of a loop! We talk about it all in the Aftershow, which you can watch as a Patreon https://www.patreon.com/evanandkatelyn or YouTube Member https://youtube.com/evanandkatelyn/join
Just rewatched this (again) Anyone else want to see the BEAN CHAIR!?
Chicken Nugget Jewlery might be the most American thing I have ever heard
wait, Yahoo still exists ?
make a resin baby and a resin diaper
OMG THEY PLAYED PACHBELLS CANNON AT THE END 😮
I absolutely thought they were going to flock the toothbrush bristles as well 😂
Yea definitely not faking it
I think that the white hot glue looks the best
“We would never do that. We don’t have access to a baby.” Katelyn casually says like if they had access to a baby they would resin cast it.
Glitter grout is a thing. Can be added in or premix. And they have silicone and epoxy based grout so hot glue is just not needed.
13:41 🥹
Does flocking powder come in different colors? Can you try shaping the goop in shapes and get furry pictures?
Resin chairrrr not stool RESIN CHAIR RESIN CHAIR RESIN CHAIRRRRRRRRR
RIP Joob😢😭😭😭😭😭
By complete accident my watching this lined up perfectly with 11:26pm my time at the exact time they said it! Had a good giggle. 😂
Velvet on itself has pretty éauøģh texture, but when I imagined the velvet part of the toothbrush touching my teeth...😬😬😬
Needle felted joob army
Guess I'll just doo doo doo on my own then 3:30
R.I.P. JOOB!!! XOXOXOX
Velvet toothbrush is if you're low on your microplastic dose.
Insane people cover nuggets in glitter for 30 minutes. 10/10. Need more!
13:31 I'm just gonna act like I don't see the pile of dishes in your kitchen
10:16 13:04
Long live Joobie in needle felt form! RIP supervisor 💞
19:12 this whole part is wild 🤣
I am totally the kind of person who would use that bean cutting board
I love that the argument against the resin-casted baby was the lack of access to the baby😂
6:56 I’m hungry now 😭
I've a little pugglee and he sheds like a snowstorm,now I know what to do with all his fluffies
The cat fur Joobie is soo good!
You guys should make an army of little felt cats. (Wool or otherwise)
11:00 "Small cat cat toy out of joob's fur" So a faux kitten?
At the end if that was salami, i also put it on my face
as a needlefelter- you are more likely to prick yourself going vertical, try at a 45 degree angle
yall need to make gloves out of joobies fur of at least black fluff (with TOE BEANS)
That guy who wants a “resin cast” of his baby should look into reborn dolls 😂
Entire beans computer?
Should have dipped the nugget in bbq colored resin
Missed opportunity to flock Evan.
i know this is an old video but i’m going to comment anyway lol   you’d probably have to sand the surface a bit of the toothbrush to get the flocking to stick. they are so slippery and i guess meant to be nonstick so toothpaste doesn’t stick to it. i’m definitely buying a flocking kit the look of velvet is so lovely and i need to coat more things in it lol
PLEASE DO MORE THIS WAS AMAZING!
Hi guys I am new here😊😊😊
The " Resin Time, Resin Time, do do do do, Resin Time " is SO ICONIC!!!!!!
The chicken nuggets kinda look like amber crystals lol 😂
Resin  time resin time do do do do resin time never gets old 😂😂😂😂
Cat and pet hair is actually something people do use for felting! I know this because I love felting, it's so interesting how you can make an item or plushie just out of pet hair, no need to fill it with cotton!
Do you still think that you gem lamp is the best creation you've ever made
should have been dino nuggies
once saw a stall that had a guy needlefelting alpacas out of alpaca wool next to a bunch of alpacas
"We don't have access to a baby" is sending me 😂
The bean board looks almost like lava texture from Minecraft or something it’s kinda neat
I don't like the chicken nuggets waste ;~;)
I really wanted a bean cutting board but the first thing that came to mind was that resin isn’t food safe
I really wanted a bean cutting board but the first thing that came to mind was that resin isn’t food safe
...I can't help but imagine some homeless guy going through their trash, finding a blinged out chicken nugget and just thinking to himself what the hell
Lol black in NATURE!? Hhahahahahahahahahahahahahah no xsuch a thing as black in nature I am an artist and I know this
The big joob and mini joob is Adam and Eve 2.0 if you think about it
8:55 I know im very late but i would recommend using clip on earrings instead of the hooks, that way your ears suffer less and you dont have to worry about your current piercings!
13:55 joob jr.
I was so triggered and got so bitter when they stopped the resin time song 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭 i straight up ignored the video until they resin timed again
You should do this again and put a small pocket in it for catnip then close the top.
I just realized that Evan is wearing the tie  dye shirt they made
Ir
Resin armor!!!!!❤❤❤
Cool if you did  made phone case ocean   spell book
29:05 I thought resin isn't food safe?
I subed for this 2:42
they should reserve an entire meal in resin......
I usually like watching your sponsored adds; you make them so fun to watch, this yahoo ad, not so much... and to think, yahoo was once the biggest thing on the internet, next to AOL.
Okay, but what about saving your own hair trimmings and using those to make felt cat toys of yourselves?
So no one is questioning why Katelyn was saving Joob's fur in a ziploc bag? Was she already intending to make a Joob voodoo doll?
Meow
You should do a resin  piggy bank 😂🐷🐷🦄
22:48 grout with resin (thank you Kate for the idea when u said the glittter glue looked like resin)
Glitter grout exists.
Not gonna lie, that bean board was hype!
do do do resin time wait i said DO DO DO RESIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNN TIMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! HEHAHAHAHHAHAHA RESIOOOOONNNNNNNNN cat time
I like cats
I love that the only reasoning against casting a baby in resin is “we don’t have access to a baby.”  Thusly, only one conclusion can be drawn. Mothers, if you have a baby lying around, please donate. It’s for a good cause, I swear!
that look like something ballanciaga would do
Can you make small resin creatures and make the resin colorful :) it’s just an idea :D
I liked when Katlyn was saying about the casting a baby in resin  she sede we can't do that because we don't have access to a baby and I took it a way like if she did have access to a baby she will do it 😂😂😂😂
I'm getting kind of hungry
actualy you can get  actual glitter grout
Idea:Coat a baloon in resin and make I look like an owl
There was a Japanese book a number of years ago where that was about felting items with cat fur.
Mia Maples made gold glitter grout if I’m not mistaken.
1:39 yup, only reason why they wouldn’t.
I've heard about brushing so much hair off of your cat and saying "I can make a whole..YOU" but this is extreme 😂❤
oh lord 😂😂😂
The cat hair joob is a voodoo doll it has part of her dna
I find it funny that this is the second youtube channel I watch that calls their cat(s) the supervisor
PUT THE CHICKEN NUGGET IN THE VACUUM CHAMBER IN THE RESIN TO INFUSE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. MIGHT WORK WITH YOUR PUMPKINS TOO
Coco
Coco
GO TO JAIL
Cat toys made of human hair
1:39 that implies that if they did have a baby they would
glitter grout is a thing now btw
The flocking Evan idea in the beginning yyyyyyyyyy
the chicken nuggets could probably work but rather then the real nugget you make a fake one and cast that?
Wait isn't resin not food safe? Are you able to safely eat off the bean Charcuttery board or not? Is the beans dangerous?
I need to do this with my dog hahah
I’m saddened that they didn’t use Dino nuggets :(    I can’t believe that they posted this a year ago! Feels like 2 months ago!!
A black cat doesn’t exist. Cats fur is only appearing black in reality. It’s a dark brown.
The intro reminded me of the time our cat came into my room while I was working on a school paper and iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii33333333328888djalfjgwejh    ghhwiiiiiiiiiiii
Make a resen lava lamp
The bean cutting board reminds me of Minecraft Lava
Operation but with resin beans
The nuggs werent dunked? Lost opportunity 😅
Is a mini Jube
Vegetarians watching the chicken nugget jewelry thing  -->  -_-
7:42 THE COWBOY MUSIC STOP💀💀
I'm sorry but there's absolutely nobody that still uses Yahoo
flock a phone case📲
Evan and Katelyn both yelling in pure delight at the finished felted Joob was so real lol her little face turned out so cute!!
😊
Errctgtv+ Ben. Dry dyed bye get btbt  tee shirt t tvgte and i will be wearing it in a couple days i will not be able to get 😂a lot to do but i will do it again gghgvbgghvrgtggtgtgghtht tthhyhe byyh yea. Hyphen byh. N.  H hh hhhhyhhhhhyhyhyhyhyhyhyhyhyhyhyhyhyhyhyhyhyh.
I'm too hungry for this. While they were putting resin on the nuggets, I kept wanting to eat it and wanting the resin to be glaze. Idk why glaze would be on a chicken nugget, but I got really hungry watching that.
29:44 TURN UP YOUR GRATITUDE TURN DOWN YOUR ATTITUDE I LOVE MY 😸 THAT MEANS I GOT CATTITUDE
Roll taht beautiful bean footage lol
The bean cutting board is amazing 😍
If you do cast a baby try the life-like dolls that look kind of like babies? That way you can say no babies were harmed in the making of your video.
Katelyn: We don't have access to a baby.  I mean, you can, but it's a nine month wait time.
Omg the chicken nuggets look like tumers
You stated that you can't put glitter in grout. Well, why not? OK, grout is opaque, but what if you sprinkled the glitter on after smoothing, but while the grout is still wet?
If i could, i would buy the cat toy
I was dying of laughing when I saw how the chicken nuggets gave up😂😂😂 But it could have been my lack of sleep.
I remeber having flocked toys at Easter as a child. After two or three times of playing with it, the flocking would come off. Goes with the territory. Idk why, but it gave me Elvis vibes. Baha
Bake your cat
velvet teeth???
Velvet Spoon.
Can you make a resin and bean cereal bowl
You two need to create some kind of “something went wrong in the garage” alarm
You two are flocking crazy
you should send the bean board to rhett from good mythical morning!!!! maybe could do a resin episode with them!!!!
Now I wonder if you can't in fact make grout with glitter 🧐
What why would she do that
more weird ideas:  -resin cups/ bowls -resin clothes - resin shoes
Who DOES joob love more i assume katelyn
Any sort of real food jewelry is weird af to me. Joob will try to eat the cat hair toy because it smells like her and she believes it is still a part of her, my cat does this with small fur clumps we pull out of him. Persians have so much fur! I could make a wig out of my cats hair if I wanted to. Hot glue is silicone so it makes sense that you can grout with it. That bean board actually looks cool.
0:00 my skin just jumped off my body at the sight of "yahoo!"
Imagine being allergic to a plush cat 🐱
Can't you just control Z
*J *awws *I *O *I *I *I
Joobi loves themselves
Educate the children 👇
BURGER CHAIN IS AWSOME OMG
Some of these ideas the audience came up with remind me the reason why 5 minute crafts exists 😂  They do things that make no sense, because people, make no sense.
10:15  Youre welcome :)
is it bad that i actually like the bean board?
Y'know voodo dolls are often a depiction of thr person you are putting the spell on, made out of their hair...
Try making a velvet table or a velvet knife
fry earrings Berger necklace
PSA  don't do this in the idea you can keep it for ever it will rot lol.
anthropologists of the future are gonna find things like this and think we were really weird.
Merch idea: shirt that says “Don’t worry, we have more glitter”
9:12 BbUt WHyyY?
I looked at those nuggets.....why did I wana eat them 😂😅
10:17 feast your ears✨
You are the best YouTubers have ever watched. I love your videos..❤❤ ❤😊😊😊
Make a residence cat model. From  maria. 😊❤❤❤
The at is so funye
Less eye make up idea.  Yer beautiful.  Rely less on the hieroglyphics.
Casting a baby in resin "We would never do that. We don't have access to a baby" That was the issue??? o.O
22:00 If anyone makes like little places with tiny tiles, maybe hot glue is the way to go for that kind of stuff!
Love you guys but these crafts made me kinda queasy lol 😅
Of course Joob liked the cat toy! It's made from cat hair, widely considered a subcategory of *trash*!
I tried needle felting with rabbit fur once...but either I didn't have enough or cat fur is just built differently I guess cuz it didn't really work for me...
Fun to watch your experiment.  Next time you want to needle felt, first take a handful of cat hair, immerse it in warm soapy water, and roll it around in your palms.  Add soap which bonds the hairs to each other and roll it around until the hair felts and forms a ball.  This ball will give you a base to attach more hair and you'll avoid the blood letting of stabbed fingers.  Those needles are very sharp!  Btw, this works with dog hair, llama and any other soft animal hair, particularly the soft undercoat.  Time to do a dog hair video!
I will never not laugh at the officiality of "We do not have access to a baby."
DIY teeth!?
I honestly thought resin wasn't food safe!
'We are hoping it shows up. If not don't worry we got more glitter'  You have the whole world's stock of glitter. I don't need to worry about you not having enough glitter XD
This video was posted nine months ago?! It feels like last week!! 😭😭😭
The Joob made Joob should have been catnip filled for ultimate fun 😅
i think joob liked the little joob toy is cause it smelled like herself and thats why she was trying to groom it either to groom herself or to groom her kitten :D
Resin grout would be cool
the cutting board looks like minecraft lava lol
the glazed nuggies
The burger needs to be a belt buckle
P
I actually put glitter in my grout mix, it was very fancy looking
This IS our business: Two healthy, intelligent, normal adults make a 3 inch toy cat out of cat hair. Me: 🙆‍♀
me watching with m cat es catatude
my cat would probs do the same thing cuz he eats his hair if i twist it into a string lol
Mad you didn't use Dino nugs
You forgot to waterproof the toothbrush! Otherwise it would’ve been perfect 😂
The ultimate pregnancy announcement: "guys we can finally try the resin baby project!"
i never thought i would ever watch people spinning chicken nuggets on little metal sticks while poring resin on it to make jury and be so entertained but here we are. Although me being the weird human being that i am, i have watched other people needlefelt with their cat's hair
A thing that I got in detail about the list at the intro is that, they wrote on it "world's biggest laptop". After some time from this video, we got it in,like- you don't see it interesting? Did you teased ideas that you were eventually making in the future in this video??
Okay the hot glue grout makes me think of mia maple's quest to do actual glitter grout in her bathroom and makes me interested in what Evan and Katelyns take on the project would be
18:20 is my favourite e and k couple moment
You guys should make a velvet phone case next
22:20 sooo turns out there IS glitter grout.
I thought that Evan was your dad😵‍💫my mind is blown 🤯Edit: where are the chicken nugget rings😭
Not gonna lie...I felt a little disappointed when yall got to the modeling of the chicken nug jewlery that you guys didnt involove or use Dino shaped nugs!
Shes a sable colored cat!
I’d be willing to bet you can get glittery grout
I love this💕
22:18, haha, I can say that if you buy some glitter and put it in the grout before you use it, you can actually have glitter grout, as that’s what we my mom did in her shower and kitchen
she probably thinks its her kitten because it smells like her 🥺
I would have suggested finishing the bumpy side of the chopping board with clear resin for a smooth finish. I don't know how often you need a bumpy cutting board in your life. But this was definitely a worthy endeavor.
Soooo who else was like "okay now flock the teeth". Just me... yeah
Can you use hot glue like a 3d pen?
Could you make mini resin pizza things
I collected dog fur and spun it into yarn, just waiting to use it lol
If anyone sees this, wow I love their videos
Now I need that bean cutting board. 😮
The nonchalant "we dont have access to a baby"
Could u make a resin glasses frame for Katelyn 😊 3:31
I’m sitting on the floor while this video is playing, and the “sudden urge to poop” stomach growl went through my surround sound and I thought it came from me! I was very concerned for a moment lol! 😅
Evan: it’s spinning! Katlynn: it’s glorious! Me: huhhh
joob has a kitten!!!
does joob think the cat toy is another cat?
Velvet phone case???🤔
Katelyn saying about the velvet toothbrush that “it’s also *wet* and *disgusting* looking” lives in my head on repeat every single day
I used to have Yahoomail but yahoo completely screwed things up as they did with everything else they had. Everytime I logged in to yahoo mail it showed me the news. Well yahoo if I wanted to read news then why am I logging in to my email??? Then they changed the web interface to a very laggy page. Yahoo is hopeless
on the topic of how Joob's hair isn't actually black, when I was a kid we had a little black and white cat, he was a weird mix of breeds but in general looked like a skinny tuxedo cat... until he got in direct sunlight.  Under direct sunlight you could tell he had tabby in him because he was actually an extremely dark chocolate brown with black tabby stripes
9:37 Warning: mentions of taxidermy and pets that have passed                      The needle felting with the fur of beloved pets is actually something some taxidermists will sometimes do to honor clients pets that have past, of course Joobie is alive and well, but it is definitely something that is done and isn’t too uncommon! Just thought I’d share that little fact because I felt it was relevant to this.
ask everyone for their moms spaghetti recipe and then make them all. Have a mom rate them.
We love resin song❤❤❤❤❤❤
Very interesting video but when Caitlin was adding the tail to the miniature felt cat I thought yes it would hurt if a needle went into your but😂
I want those chicken nuggets now. But I k ow I can't eat resin
Can you Make a sillacone toylet seat please
minecraft joobie
Been toilet seat?
The resin taste test and resin hair wanted to make me cry 😭
i would do clear with glitter or white glitter
lol umm they make glitter grout sssooooo ya that looked like fun though rofl
It's not, but I feel like the pooping at the same time phenomenon should be better documented.
DiY resin toothbrush??
About Joob's fur being lighter than y'all expected, my cat is naturally black, but she lays out in the sun so much that her hair has lightened to a reddish brown color. Pretty interesting tbh
MAKE A VELVET PHONE!!!!!!!!!
Now you just have to flock the teeth!! 😊
Just wait until they find out about glitter grout
so cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute
There is a book all about felting with your cats hair btw! You guy should get it and make some stuff from it!!!
"we are not crazy people", but she keeps the bag with cat hair 😂😂😂😂
The joob toy is like a vodo doll, the way that job was playing with it made it seem like it was her baby
I feel like they missed a chance because  they didn't use dino nuggets😅😂
"we would never do that- we dont have access to a baby"
The music😭
but the cutting board, is that safe to eat off of?
Katelyn: if it doesnt show dont worry we have more glitter.  Katrlyn I was truly never worried that you guys didn't have other glitter options lol. that would be like not expecting evan to be chaotic
What about doing a resin puzzle piece set or a glow in the dark resin Chess set ??
18:58 😂😂😂 I can‘t - 💀
That's gonna rot you know
VELVET TEETH
I don't understand why they keep put food in resin. I thought they are going to make a silicone mold from nuggets and used colored resin ... but they didn't.
“Resin time” is a certified bop
Can you make your own hot glue?
This is an older video but what if you ... Velveted the gums of that set if teeth. You know just to make it horrifying
The holes in Evan’s socks 💀
Oh my god Joobie LOVED tiny Joob. It probably smelled like her lol.
You guys should make a cast of your hands in a line with joobs paw in the middle. Idk how it would work but like a plaster cast and then resin it. Or you guys could make the Disney haunted mansion face that moves as you move but do it with your faces.
It's the music over the bean board for me
You definitely should have made a mold of the nugget then make the earrings
I have a weird idea carrot chain necklace cuz 24 carrot gold chain
✨️flock the teeth✨️
2m 29kl 663kw
Make the teeth velvet
Been cutting board is genius I need more like citrus slices or Swiss cheese lol
That bean cutting board almost made me cry:,)
Should have bean a bean/10 😆

You made a voodoo cat 🐈‍⬛
No one’s gonna talk about how after Jube pressed the button the little alarm was smoking
maybe im old but the resin time transition needs a little reworking. Katelyns singing is super cute, personally id wanna see it continue but maybe instead of a cutescene it could just be overtop of the video?
re: glitter grout: if you were to make grout from the powder and added water, you could probably totally add glitter to that.
The hot glue could work if you had an automatic dispenser
The needle felt joob is actually a thing, idk if you've seen some of the really fancy ones that people make of others pets for keepsake
What is Joob’s email address?
I love ❤️ your videos so much come to my house 🏠 please. here are the coordinates——————————————————————-I can’t get the real coordinates because this could spread to the Internet and I don’t want any bad pretty people coming to my house. I love your video. I love your videos. They are so fun and interactive.

wait i thought resin wasn't food safe?
I'm just happy, knowing I'm not the only weirdo that collects my cats fur!
12:58 bow to the blob joobie 🐈‍⬛😊
It’s interesting/weird - how many of us are totally OK with the idea of wall yarn and doing crafts with it. But our cringing and barking at the thought of how gross cat hair is. Why is sheep hair ok, but then cat hair is not OK? Makes you think. Lol.   So the felting was actually a really cool idea. As well as a look into the deeper social code of what’s considered gross vs not gross.
the button is very Doofinsmirtz of you 😂😆😆😆
They should make velvet dice
"we lost quite a bit on the tip there, it also looks wet and disgusting, uuh would you care to open up the cheeks?" Katelyn 2023
They actually do make glitter grout, we almost got it for our kitchen
3:35 its so funny
They make grout with glitter.
"don't have access to a baby" almost implies that you would if you could 😂
I'd buy a BEAN cutting board, definitely a 10/10
Why not do a clear layer of resin on the top of the bean board?
Rewatching this again and I just noticed the World’s Biggest Laptop Easter egg!
That intro...  So, if you only have one toilet and you both have the urge to poop, who poops first?
The velvet toothbrush actually creaped me me out
Joob voodoo doll
As if their own ideas aren’t cursed enough already:/  (said with love)
Joob thinks it's her kitten because it smells like her.
katelyn, can you be the voice of reason for my life, thankyou hahah
Can you make a resen doll house
I think the chicken nugget jewelry would be more enduring if you used the real thing to mold and cast resin nuggets (katelynn could paint) to be made into adornments.  I dont know WHY felting with cat hair seems so much creepier than sheep "hair" but IT IS.
best episode ever
I AGREE U ARE SO VERY SPECIAL KATELYN <3
fun fact: black cat fur is actually dark brown
18:20 I love how Evan just automatically goes along with Katelyn sticking her finger in his mouth Like he wasn’t even fazed
The way katelyn just casually sticks her finger in evan’s mouth
@evanheling: I can see the holes on your socks at 00:17 😛
As soon as they said beans me and my buddies all screamed "THIS MF EATIN' BEANS" good video
I had a fluffy black cat who died last year, sadly, and I used to brush her and then ball up the hair that I got off of her. Then, I'd throw it like a cat toy and it was perhaps her favorite thing to play with. The other cats played with them too. Even the dog liked them! I miss that flooffer but I'm thankful for all the years I had with her.
Well they now have a little Joob voodoo doll....
when i first saw the thumbnail i thought you were making velvet teeth
They put world's biggest laptop on the fake idea list...... Really makes you think,,,,,,
watching you needle felt without any finger guards on is stressing me out 😂
Why do you do the things you do 😂😂
What's the email if it's not to late I have a great idea! I've been watching you guys since 2020 witch has been my life! I want to send you an email about 2 ideas
you guys should make a resin sword, make it clear blue like the ocean and have broken chunks of floating islands thru out the blade
they should cast a baby doll
Was a joy to rewatch.. loving your content and the Supervisor is a cutie btw 🤟🇨🇦
Ah yes the perfect sauce for chicken nuggets (resin time resin time dodododo)
Your cat probably thinks it's a baby cat
Am I the only one seeing candy corn instead of beans?
Ok. A voodoo version of Joobe was NOT on my bingo card.
How long did it take to collect all that Supervisor hair?
I thought you were going to flock the teeth.. 😬....🤔 next idea?
OH
Regarding the chicken nugget jewellery, I was surprised that you did not make silicone molds of a couple of nuggets and cast the resin from those molds. Then you can play with the resin colour or even paint the castings.
OK random question why do you have to wear those masks while you’re using the resin and why don’t you use it or didn’t use it while you were still using the resin? I’m just wondering if there’s something wrong with the resin while you’re mixing it or combining it with other solutions? Whatever it is, I just want to know.
You should make a bean bowl for eating your beans in!
I just can’t with the kitty! She is too cute!
You guys should say "yeah" after do do do do.
Maybe, you could make a better Phonograph! than what is available.  I have over 10k LP's and over 10k 45 rpm records, so... when I have to buy something that maybe more hazardous to my ears - It kind of ruins the whole idea of even buying a new  old stock LP/45. And yes I have a lot of original 64/65 Beatles LPs all original. who would want to ruin any beatles Lp's!
Why does the beans they use always looks like peanuts, more specifically peanuts brittle, maybe I just want some pé de moleque or they should try a more bean like bean 😭
I love the 2 personalities of Katelyn. On-Screen Katelyn is happy and fun while Editing Katelyn comes across as jaded and has no filter lol.
But what if you only flock the part of the toothbrush you hold?
My partner walked in while I was watching this video and went "these people and their BEANS!!!"
The velvet tooth brush looks wrong. XD
OMG, Yahoo is still alive?! 😯
They are probably the cutest couple that has ever existed, I love getting to watch their relationship while they work together
what can you do with black 3.0 paint the blackest paint on earth
i want a giant catcus
Try to cook chicken with resin
I love the mini joobaviser
Evan  looks like Sam Riegel from Critical Role
catzilla!!!! rip vid ideas also big fan of yall. <3 :):):):):):):)
Out of interest, what kind of cat is Joob?
I was really wanting some flocked teeth
@Evan and Katelyn ya know glitter grout is a thing and you can buy it! this is npot new just rare to non creatives.
Underwater resin
Fun fact, I've spun cat hair into yarn
0:30 what is husband and wife husband Challange
MORE BEAN TOOLS!! I think a bean plant pot would be very cool
Omg i love the bean cuttingboard!!!
28:48 microplastics feast
Glitter grout Is an actual product you can buy!!!
I think the reason joobie likes the toy made out of cat hair is because it smells like her. next time you make something for joobie, cover it in that fur and then, since it smells like her, she thinks/knows it is HERS.
There's a reason why they do it with cucumbers and not pepperoni. 😂
idea for the next vid: velvet grout... the most luxurious grout 😂
You realize you have to do that entire list, right?
The beans Charcuterie board had me dying on the floor bro💀
Why do I feel like joob thought like "oh this smells like me? This my child I never knew I had??" Hence the aggressive licking-
I slightly want to watch Evan and Katelyn make a chessboard using the tile and hot glue grout method.
You can buy glitter you can put in grout ( it's aestethetic 100%) but you can get glitter grout too
Okay ngl the baked bean charcuterie board is both the most British yet also coolest thing I've seen resin wise! (Also I'm a chef lol)
I swear that velvet toothbrush is a torture method some place in the world 💀😭
You can definitely put glitter in grout! And colour it with pigments. Grout is much cheaper and easier to use. I ❤️ grout.
🤢
Your “making it wet” technique was flawless 👍
Make resin Dutch Clogs.
I made the mistake of eating as the toothbrush section came on and Katelyn putting a finger in a real mouth then a fake mouth and back again was so weird 😂
You guys should try hydro dipping its super fun and super easy.
I think Joon thought the toy was a kitten since it smelled like her, like a cat.
Tidus laugh just after 12:20
Pardon my language, but that toothbrush is the worst flocking idea ever.
This was such a fun video! Thank you for trying all these things!! I love love love the mini Joob made of Joob hair!❤
You can actually make your own flocking using felt, and then just normal craft glue, or superglue if you really want it to stay on there. It's a cheaper way of doing it and I've seen a lot of doll customizers use this method before.   Just regular clear-dry craft glue, cut up some felt in the colour you want, maybe paint whatever you're putting it on to match before you put the glue.
The beginning of the video made me want chick fil a so bad
You didn’t rate the last one!
the cat hair toy is a voodoo doll
It would be Joub-ner
I can imagine trying to explain to this chicken that it is going to be turned into nugget jewelry
I am guesing that why Joobie was grooming it is becouse it's actual cat hair and it smells like her so mabey she thought it was her kitten?🤔🤔🤔
I feel if you grout with hot glue it can work in like a doll house maybe? @.@
I just wanted to say that they make glitter for grout now! My husband and I have used it on multiple jobs.
I want the resin hair! pleeeeeease
you guys should brake bad and make candy meth
They do have grout that has glitter in it FYI. During house building i could not convince SO to let me sneak glittery grout into our bathroom haha. But it does exist and its colorful!
You guys are so mean to the fans’ ideas 🥲
I really want to flock everything i own 😭😭😭
So I know it's been a bit, but I remembered to comment on my second watch. There are full books on needle felting with cat fur. I know Chewy has at least one but it's probably findable in normal book stores as well.
Re the cat hair toy.. did joobie like it because she thought it was her baby?
Some comments to say something don't get magnalock Xavier, something YouTube bloxom all videos on YouTube 🤔
Katelyn there is glitter grout!!!!
Hut glue grout hmm... I don't necessarily see that being a bad idea. In terms of materials you can definitely get some hot-glues that would be very hygenic, robust and flexible enough to not crack with age. Regular porous grout definitely sucks that's for damn sure. They are dirt magnets and kid of defeat the whole point of the tiles being so easy to keep clean in a wet-room.  As for making them perfectly smooth - that is easy. Just use a hot-air gun (or a few ideally). All hot-glues should be thermoplastic and re-meltable basically infinitely. You should be able to get them to flow nice and even quite easily after putting down the rough amount. Also - removing any superflous glue should be pretty easy on tiles if you just use a flat utility-blade. Especially if the glue is at a semi-malleable temperature it should cut through like butter.  The main downside I think would be time and tedium to do for a whole floor. A lot of melting, remelting and careful scraping to get it perfect. That's probably a big reason why grout is traditionally used. Once you know how to do that it's pretty simple.  But I do seriously wonder why silicone isn't used though. That would be much easier to apply - and is already used everywhere else in wetrooms for it's excellent properties.
The shot of Katelyn running and throwing the big cardboard box had me dead, love you guys
Evan and Katelyn only wear black because theyre emo      and amazing video, love it
I thought they threw away silicone molds after they used them but to my surprise after three year from the original video they use the silicone molds from the island cutting board
Glitter silicon instead of hot glue?
Maybe do a collab with Mia Maples..... she's on a vendetta to find the infamous tiktok gold glitter grout. She's tried quite a few.... and failed (ish)
9:55 no cat can be black, they are all just really dark brown, the brown is clearer if pierced by light :)
1:38 not BC it's wrong... Because there is no baby readily available 😂
My friend felted a necklace from my late cat's fur as a Christmas present to me. I nearly cried
Me when they mentioned chicken nugget jewellery: Intense Resin Pumpkin flashbacks. This was a fun and weirdly relaxing video, really enjoyed watching this to de-stress. The cat hair felting was adorable, I wish my cats' fur let me do that but it's too short, haha.
Who is gonna tell them that they make glitter grout? Lol
"We don't have access to a baby-" Ah, yes, the only reason you wouldn't cast a baby in resin
I think that's the most pawsitive reaction I've ever seen your supurrvisor give a project!
Wait... you guys ate off that resin cutting board?? Isnt resin like... super not food safe???
fun fact: cats get vitamin D from their fur after it is exposed to sunlight by eating it. that's why cats will eat their fur from their cat brush (if your not careful)
why does the resin give it like… honey glazed nugget vibes???
theres actually an artist that uses animal fur to memorialize pets that passed away in this way! i saw them on tiktok
i’m neurodivergent with sensory issues and a big “ick” texture for me is velvet. that toothbrush is like a medieval torture device 😂
I thought you would flock the teeth haha
More cursed toilet seats! Make a reusable resin mold and make epic ones, Bob Ross ones, and a BEANS toilet seat!
You should do a lifesize-statue of the supervisor out of resin, to like, worship her the way she deserves  <3  Also, maybe a fruit pebbles and resin phone cover? 😂
Katelyn's mouth: "We would never cast a baby in resin. We don't have access to a baby"  Katelyn's eyes: "And that's the ONLY reason!"
Am I the only one that wants to see more of their woodworking stuff again? It seems like it’s only ever the resin now
For the hot glue you could grout a doll house
“Mer mer meow”
You guys should make some resin car dash parts, or some gameboy shells and buttons. endless video ideas.
29:46 meow!
WE DONT HAVE ACCESS TO A BABY😂😂😂
You should definitely do resin boxers 🩲
velvet toothbrush would work well if only the handle part is velvet, but then the neck part that attaches to the head and the head itself is a different material, that still looks kinda fancy, maybe something in chrome. that way you won't scrape the velvet part with your teeth while brushing
Finally, a confession video.
Please make more videos like this one
My sister works at a tile store and you CAN get glitter to add to your grout!!
SUPERVISORRRR 👏👏
Can you get jubie a sibling
Flock the teeth
"Cast a baby in resin but we can never do that, we don't have access to a baby" lmfao
Please make a color changing cat mat so then you can see Joobs toe beans
You can glitter regular grout... They maker glitter specifically for grout, it's amazing, ice used it in the shower at my old house. I wish I could attach a picture so you can see how pretty it is. I'm obsessed with it.
9:07 - I've actually always wanted to try this! My partner's cat, Henry, sheds SO much, so i like to brush him when I visit. Since there's so much excess hair on the brush and around the room, I like collecting the and making them into little balls. Sometimes, I'll put them on Henry's head when he's just hanging around 😂 it is amazing how well it sticks!
When the sun shines on my black kitty cat his fur shines brown
...Beef jerky earrings
You can even felt catnip into things!
Is it sad I recognize the nuggets are from McDonalds and Chick-fil-a? Okay um ya its sad. Nugget love Y'all
I had that same kind of cat she made so many babies beautiful animal. black cat crew for real.
Evan alway ends up eating and it’s always stuff there are covering in resin or cutting with a resin knife which I love it is awesome 😊
Resin Time! Resin Time! Do, do, do ,do Resin Time!
Why do I know how that toothbrush would feel if I licked it D'X
VELVET TEETH
I was hoping for the thoothbrush to work better
I got a good idea... Or a bad one lol! So glasses that are ✨velvet✨!!
can you make this a series??? this was actually super fun!!
Would love to watch you make a galaxy toilet seat.
Now I need a bean (hand) bag
Sometimes I forget is Evan giant or is Kate small then I remember it's probably both
Next time you should make Joob a cat ear hat out of felted Joob fur.
I clicked on for velvet tooth brush’s and cat hair teeth not for them messing around with resin and chicken nuggets
"would you care to open up the cheeks?" ..... heheh
0:35, gives "WRONG LEVER KRONK!!!!" energy!!!
you know you can push the glue stick with your finger instead of pulling the trigger over and over. <3
Ok, hear me out resin sunglasses
18:53 VILE 🤣
Katelyn's subtle "I told you so" editting of the bean cutting board had me rolling lmao
About grout: it lets the wall underneath the tiles breathe. That's why you can't use glue. Glue doesn't allow drying if (WHEN) water gets underneath the tiles. Most tiles allow water to evaporate throughout the structure and grout supports that. :)
on the joob hair felting topic, there are a few people who have made a living off of making felted murals out of pet hair (of the pet) once they've passed, i've seen a couple tick tocs about em, but it's a pretty plyable thing to work with is what I seem to understand
they do make glitter grout though!
You should totally try to make a leg lamp from Christmas story
How is pumpkin
Wow lol I love you guys, you always make me laugh, and I love your cat lol
I love this transition XD its so satisfying with his face and the music 21:16
I just love the connection and love yall have with each other for you to be able to just start "Brushing" Evan's teeth with your finger without permission 😂 ❤
The cat hair toy had me laughing and smiling so wide. I might need to do the same with my cat’s hair 😂
Not sponsored by TotalBoat anymore?
Katelyn is such an adorable little gremlin. 😂
So no one told them about glitter grout 👀
It's her kitten now! :D I would love to try to needlefelt with cat hair XD Just take some extra allergy meds and find where to get some cat hair, I guess
I am supposed to wear Oval-8 ring splints on my fingers due to Ehlers Danlos Syndrome making my fingers too bendy. The splints are unfortunately a gross beige-y skin tone color and I tend to paint them with nail polish to make them look cooler. Now I am wondering if it would be possible to make silicone molds of them and then cast them in glittery resin 👀   I have NO IDEA how I would go about doing that without fancy equipment. Also, is resin sturdy enough for daily wear and rigid enough to not bend with my fingers?
Who woulda thought that cat fur would needle felt so well? I wonder if Joob thinks it’s like her kitten or something since it’s small and smells like her?
Cursed video idea: Turf toilet seat. Yeah, like just attached to the seat..
Bean plate
Truly cursed content. 10/10.
Instead of hot glue grout use epoxy resin.  That way you can dye it the color you want, glitter, glow, etc.
You should have a colab with Ali Spagnola,you guys have the weirdest toilet seats ever.she has a chia pet one,you guys have a mood ring one.Would be best colab ever
Made by joob for joob
this is like the 6th video where he doesnt listen to katelyn and keeps going and has to fix it later
Hot glue gun tip, you can just push the glue stick itself in so it's a consistent pressure/pace
Joob has provided her child through asexual reproduction- 👏👏👏👏
XD
for some reason, I am here for the chicken nugget glam. that's it that's the ideal aesthetic
Uhm... Is resin actually food safe? I don't think it is. At least, not that boat resin.
Holy hipster Batman. Nugget jewelry...
There are many Artists that offer Jewellery out of Cathair by needle felting. for an example as a Memory for a Cat that has passed away. Doghair works as well, too.
the board on the smooth side does look alot like a image huh? thats cool
Please PLEASE try to make one of the melting clocks from dali For your next Buy or DIY
All time fav video! I love this!
My name is Katelyn too!!!!
squeeese -katelyn 2023
this makes me want to eat chicken nuggets a lot mmmm chicken nuggets
Can you felt with cotton candy
How about a "pink floyd" dark side of the moon sign that actually takes white light and produces a rainbow on the other side, you could try to replicate a prism in resin or something it'd be pretty sick
22:18 @Mia Maples is wondering why she suddenly started thinking about the glitter grout she so desperately desires...😂
That flocked tooth brush brought back so many memories of my grandparent's bath room, EVERYthing in there was fuzzy: toilet lid cover, the weird rug around the toilet stool, the tissue box cover was blue flocked plastic that was shaped to look like it was quilted, I even recalled a cup type toothbrush holder with the outside blue flocked to match (but at least not the top?).  So many things that needed to be smooth, washable surfaces!
Bro, Evan is like the human version of Jerry smith from Rick and morty, tell me I’m wrong
Actually glitter grout does already exist, so even less reason to to use hot glue.
"Trying fried wood for the first time," and "Resin hair" are things I really want to come to life.
i just found this channel and i love these two so much! My favorite craft channel on this website, and their gaming channel is good two. I could watch these two for hours and hours.
Yall made a voodo doll for Joob
Have you ever thought od making a Catan board game in resin? If you have, scrolling through I couldn’t see it - but it’s four in the morning and I can’t see much (I’m typing with one eye closed). My friends and I have been thinking about making a Catan board - in resin - but have no where to start. Do we make a silicon mold first? Ughh. Maybe I’m dreaming. And maybe my friends aren’t really real - just members of my dream Encouraging me to ask this ridiculous question. Eh. Asking anyway. Back to dreaming
You guys should make a custom resin litter box for the su-purr-visor.😊
Always freaks me out seeing joobie bc she looks identical to my cat Rick. Like twins. I know black cats can look similar but it's every freaking angle hahaha
Can you pls make a blanket out of Joob
Okay, BUT I wanna know WHO CALLED? Who is this mystery person?
Normal Grout can absolutely have glitter in it just a heads up xD Hotglue is anything has the advantage of not staining like grout CAN do to surfaces be it colored or not.
Btw...u can do glitter grout now!!! It's a whole thing...mia maples did it on her channel in her bathroom!!!
You unintentionally made a joob voodoo doll....  O_O pet the doll when out and about. hehehehe
Bean phone!!! It's broken 😢😢😢😢 you need to fix it
We would never cast a baby out of resin, we don't have access to a baby.  Lmao 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
I've seen someone on YouTube shorts, make a needle point out of a past pet's hair. It was a way to help some owners mourn.
use a razor edge to clean the edges after it's dry, maybe?.......
Do cooking with evan and katelyn in the new house/new kitchen please I have missed I for so long😿
You should make a DIY color changing water bubble lamp. I want to make one of my own and I think it would be a Good project with a good outcome.
"We would never do that, we dint have access to a baby" 🤣😭
Somebody scammed me in a different game please report them there name was kid_Evan
What the… you absolutely _can_ have glitter in grout. It’s literally called *glitter grout* there are places that sell glitter specifically for adding to grout
Why didn't you guys use toothpaste and make the teeth wet?
make a cutting board keyboard right now
Joob: hmm smells this new toy smells like me..... Also joob when even and katelyn leave: DESTROY
I can just imagine one day, hundreds of years in the future, archeologists would stumble upon all the projects you guys made. I can only imagine the confused look on their faces when they find salmonella chicken nuggets sealed in resin earrings and pendants 😂 I feel out of all these the bean cutting board was my favourite and the most practical. Although, you probably don't want to use it as a cutting board and rather use it as a serving board/paddle (if only it wasn't so flexible)
Wouldn’t it be easier to just dip the nuggets into the resin
You should do an alphabet soup keyboard
My 8 yr old daughter, Amelia (HUGE fan, like, she wants to be a YouTuber because of y'all) says you should make either a resin hair clip, toothbrush, OR a resin pair of glasses! We love your channels, we adore Jooby, she's soooo cute!! Hope y'all are well, and have a great day!
Make a chIcken nugget clock
The ad had scary accurate footage of how all my ordered packages are being handled and delivered at my house.
Can you test out resin thats tergeted to kids. Like the resin you csn buy at the toy store? Like how safe is it for kids
Can you paint a shoe or make a resin shoe pleaseee
you should do plates cutlery and cups out of 'beans'
can you play stardew valley
as someone who works in a diy store we do sell glittery grout and also bags of glitter to add to any grout so you can have grout full of glitter if you like but for some reason very few people buy it
Love y’all’s videos! You are so clearly talented, intelligent, and adorable together! Maybe in the future you could make a video about the environment impact of resin art? It’s a super cool and beautiful craft but it also leaves a pretty big footprint, I think it would be interesting for your viewers to hear about that too. Love seeing your stuff but it’s also important to see all sides. Wish you and the supervisor the best!
I genuinely hope you continue this, I love cursed projects
You can actually add glitter to grout!
okay but why does evan pull off the nugget necklace he made it look like the runway type fashion
the velvet toothbrush is on the same level as carpet in the bathroom
amazeballs.
Would probably take me a week to save up enough hair to do the cat hair felting with my cat Liette
7:30 katelyn really said let him cook
You guys give off a garfield and hello kitty vibe and i absolutely love it
Learn how to do crochet Amigurumi and make joob 😊
The needle felted Joob is so cute! More needle felting content please!!
How about a onlyfans page, im willing to pay for the brownbhaird :D
can we.... not waste food for no reason? exspecially not food that is already made in an insanly cruel and disgusting way?
i thought this was uploaded so long ago (i always feel like its ages in between uploads bc i love your videos) and was looking for the needle felting video you mentioned only to realize you said it'd be up "next week" and this was only uploaded 6 days ago 😭 sobbing
Resintisserie
I like you guys… … … and like, I really mean I like you guys… … but like, you guys are such weird cat people. You guys need a kid or two.
OK so hear me out... y'all have made a couple of bean related resin items so far... you've also made dice... what about making bean dice (pls my dnd character needs these)
1:40 im concerned the fact that you wouldnt do it because you dont have access to a baby like you didnt even mention the fact that you would have to incase a baby in RESIN?!?
i cant not say this-          *he flocked me with a toothbrush*
Well now we need resin plates and bowls with different foods in them like a cookies in white (milk) resin bowl
I actually experimented on the cat hair just by picking some in the floor and poking it before this vid🤣😂🤣 the way how I actually just pick s9me cat hair in the floor was funny
I see those chic-fil-a nuggets, you can't fool me! Love them <3
Having bounced around some various cooking and dessert channels recently one thing I would love to see Evan and Katelyn play around with is Agar Agar gel.   Gelatine coffee, that can still be warm... Just imagine it, or not
Why does the Nugget jewelry look so so good
I haven't heard the name Yahoo in years.
hot tip, leather finger covers for felting
Chicken nuggets? How could you miss the opportunity to make Luna's raddish earrings?
Why not dip them in resin then put on rotisserie to cure? I'm sure there is a reason I just don't know it.
Who says you can't grout with glitter? I mean, just dump in a bunch of glitter to regular grout and voila! Video idea...?
#2 was 1000 out of 10. Tiny Joon is sooo cute!!
If you ever want to felt with cat hair again, it's less "hairy" if you pick out the stiffer guard hairs and only use the fluffy undercoat!
Ah, "those" nuggets of non-descript origin. XD
Will the nuggets go bad?
I have the most cursed idea : beans cat bed it can be like the black hole cat bed just filled with *BEANS*
Clearly now you need to velvet the teeth.
chicken noodle soup cutting board! cheese 🧀 cutting board  marshmallow cutting board
Thank you so much for having my idea in the video. You guys are amazing!
Glitter grout is definitely a thing .
You guys should do blacksmithing
22:31 There’s actually glittery grout I saw recently in a video!!!!
The Waffle House Has found its new host
was that food safe resin 😮😅
"Just a little resin residue"  Dare I say, RESIN-due?
"We don't have access to a baby"  Yes, that's the only problem with that idea...
Guys, guys! Resing chessboard with chesspieces but they have secret ingredients inside! Like cheetos, pepperoni, grass blade... 😄
I dont know if you'll see this, but you should try clay modeling and static grass flocking!
you can have it with gliter
Didn't E&K refuse to do resin cutting boards this far because resin isn't food safe..?
At least the hot glue grout is a good way of testing grout colours
29:04 idk if this is bad or not but I do hope that the bean cutting Bord is a food safe rein cuz when I was watching even eat off of it I was like no even no don’t eat the food its not safe 😅😅😅 😂😂😂😂😂
You can absolutely add glitter to grout
you did needle felting I'm SO HAPPEY!!!!!!!!!!
The needle felting thing makes me wish I had a cat with fur lmfao
Omg you NEED to do Evans idea of making a resin burger necklace
does the resin safe for food?
Ya'll do know they make glitter to mix in grout, right?
Hey guys i loved the video and ive had a brilliant idea 💡... id like to see you guys use Uv resin to make a dragon winged and Amethyst fantasy handled boot 👢 knife 🔪  or dagger 🗡 and if you are successful in the creation of it tag me in the Video and I'll send you a surprise gift... and the blade has to be functional easy to hold and properly carry
Take the bean cutting board, run a router on the bottom side, and incorporate LED lights for backlighting
Ok so this would work, but maybe don't do it. Chicken nuggets have air in them, you can try using stabilizing resin to fill those voids and then carve the nuggies with facets.  Alternatively you could blend the chicken nuggets into a paste and stabilize it as a fleshy micarta block, and make a McKnife.
I feel like it be an amazing idea to get an ice-cream cone and make “Ice Cream “ with glittery resin! (Sorry if this idea was already done )
Lol 19:00 I was brushing my teeth while watching this at the same time, weird feeling
I still can't understand how beans have this bright orange soup... ?
Resin residue?! NO… Resindue
I love how the reaction to casting a baby wasn't "we wouldn't do it" it was "we would do it, we just don't have access to a baby"
Your jokes are hilariously inappropriate, but in a way younger kids can’t understand them lol
Ok the nuggets jewelry is a no. if Joob plays with the cat toy would she be playing with  her self. As for the toothbrush you should auction it off.
My SIL as a joke made her mom earrings out of her cats hair for Christmas one year 😂😂
I feel like this just ended up being s 5 minute crafts idea video 5 minute crafts is gonna see this video and take a lot of ideas from this video
Please, please, PLEASE flock the teeth. Or at least the gums. Please.
The next time freeze dry the nuggets to get rid of the moisture.
Do a resin beach theme toilet seat, like the bath tray you did way ago.
I recovered one of the ideas from the video for you and I want it to be a thing. "Gelatin toilet seat"
Now cover the Teeth in velvet
Um I saw several attempts of glitter grout
I think that was a sign to get jooby a kitten
13:40 I’m pretty sure she thought it was one of her babies bc it smelled like her
Honestly having one textured side of a cutting bored is a great idea, I hate when I’m cutting something round and it just pops right out from under my dull knives that I’m too lazy to sharpen! Solution: BEANS
I need a short of the hot glue grout segment to send to my dad 😭 he’d love it
here's to another day of waiting for evan and katelyn to dehydrate the food they resin....
the hot glue is kind of a non-slip grout
joob and the felted joob was the best thing ive seen all month
The most luxurious grout would obviously be velvet flocked grout.
I just started needle felting, and was wondering whether cat hair would work as a medium myself 😂😂😂
Joob is treating the mini Joob like a kitten.
14:05
i want to eat beans that were made on a bean cutting board made with beans...
Glitter grout exists!
The bean board reminds me of minecraft lava xD
This was brilliant, love the idea of testing bad ideas! This needs to be a series 😅 Sure other in the comments will have beaten me to it but glitter grout exists! There is also clear grout that is more liquid consistency so you can add colour and/or glitter! ✨️
Look up glitter grout.
You should put resin over the velvet covered toothbrush. I am curious what velvet would look like covered in resin?
The orange nabs on the bean board had me crying!!!
Felt the teeth…. Felt. The. Teeth.
I love you guys I watch every video you post I've been here since your first time making soap 3 years ago and I've been watching since you have incredible humour always makes me happy if you read this thank you for your time
When I saw the thumbnail, I full on thought y’all were gonna flock the teeth like how people have gold teeth
I love how I know where both of those nuggets are from
My first thought coming into this video... 'Oh no...'   The chicken nuggies looked yummy, but I think the fake chicken ones would be lighter on the ears.. ^_^'  Ooh!  I love the idea of a cat toy!  My sister also collects a bunch of the fur from her cat's combings (and whiskers that fall out) and that could be something she Finally does with it.  :3
It's the chick fil a nuggets for me
I mean. Glitter grout is a thing. 🤷‍♀️
I totally said, “it wool”, right here 9:41
For the hot glue, to get it out of the gun faster push on the glue stick
I think the word you were looking for is blursed it's a combo of blessed and cursed
Glitter grout is a thing! I believe the brand Bostik has it.
Joob needs a kitten 🥲
I was really hoping they'd flock the gums of the substitute mouth
Is felting basically chaos weaving?
THE WAFFLE HOUSE HAS FOUND IT'S NEW HOST
Actually glitter groat exists
Y'all that NUGlace is incredible
You guys should flock a shirt
"We would never do that, we dont have access to a baby"~Katelyn 2023
I want a bean bowl so you can eat your beans out of a bean bowl
This girl named Mariah Elizabeth crafted with her cat for an you could do the same with your cat's hair how about that.
idea: silicone toilet seat, copy and paste if you want this to happen
For the hot glue on tile, wait for the hot glue to fully cool than use a razor blade paint scraper over the grout line to remove the excess glue
LOL My cat’s fur felts very easily. All I have to do is rub it between my palms. Of course the downside of this is he gets clumps in his fur that are very hard to comb out.
Another idea: cat shelves. They can be very fancy, with shapes, and since you guys like space, it could be a moon, a sun and stars
Does anyone else want them to flock the teeth now.
I never really looked at katelyns ring, but it’s beautiful! ❤ also very funny and cool video I love watching the DIYS and laughing with you guys ❤
Super entertaining as always! ❤ Check out the book Felted Hats for Cats. It’s an amazing variety for all your cat hat needs.
the waffle house has found it’s new host
Somehow I read hot glue grout as groot and I really thought you were going to make Groot out of hot glue 🥲. Maybe for your next “terrible” idea video🙈? 21:00
The beans look like Minecraft lava
just seeing the thumbnail and i already felt that fuzzy stuff in my mouth oh god
That velvet toothbrush reminds me of Dr. Seuss.
You should rename the channel to Do do resin time
All I could think of while you were flocking the tooth brush was that it looks like Elmo.
Yall just made a voodoo doll of Joob
There is a glitter additive for grout.
Ya'll should invest in a dehydrator or maybe a freeze drier. Dehydrator may result in shrunken chicken nuggets, freeze dry might help it keep it's shape.
I hate to break it to y’all but glitter grout absolutely does exist in non-hot-glue form 😂
Yumm, the forbidden nugget
The Waffle House has found its new host.
Can you put a canned beans label on the bean cutting board?

Glitter grout is actually a real thing! I remember being obsessed with it in like freshman year of high school. 😂
Thanks I hate it

It's weird to me that Yahoo has resorted to advertising that they do email...
Have chat gpt write an episode for you guys or suggest ideas
The Waffle House has found its new host
no dino nuggies for the jewelery???
I like that their reasoning for not casting a baby in resin was that they do not have access to a baby 🤣👌
Who's gonna tell them that glitter grout exists? 😏✨️
flock the teeth
0:21 DISASTER JOOB OH NO
I never thought I’d see resin time get interrupted, Katelyn you did something crazy I can’t believe it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I mean Joob liking the little Joob makes sense because baby Joob smells like big Joob.
Idea 3 comment - because you stick the whole top of a toothbrush in your mouth you should have just flocked the handle.
Anyone going to tell that glitter grout is a thing😁😁
i really hope they do fake resin food decore, like those fake spilled drinks or bowls of ceral and ramen, that would rock!
here's an idea for you 2, make toothbrush's out of resin.
These maybe listed as bad ideas but I have a suggestion for what I think is a good one... Resin 3d blooms. They usually make coasters but I'd love to see what kind of twist you could put on it!
get joob a kitten man
Ok, but, like, people get gold teeth, so why don’t they get velvet teeth??
I'm pretty sure you could build a chladni plate, then pour resin on it, then find a resonate pattern that you love, then run the plate until the resin cures. After the resin cures add sides to the plate and then bury your resonate pattern under new layers. The plate may need to be white or clear if possible. I've been thinking of trying to do this for years but I think you two are the resin time masters and should really introduce your audience to this concept.  I hope you do it. Good luck.
Sticks finger in cheek of Evan for scientific purposes 🤓
One of the best channels in youtube
Just watched your new what about your version of resin chess graduation pool set it's like a only Galaxy or you can make a painting make it like your bleach set like you guys do and I love those put the rainbow wood texture in it that you did at of the peppermint can and then put the Galaxy behind it with different resins
I love you guys and you should do  resin hair
they should make resin mug that has a cat tail as the handle and a cat face on the opposite of the handle. Unless they have already done that.
You can add glitter to grout
Me and my friend did a resin kit and it had part a and part b resins and the instructions said to SCRAPE THE SIDES but I told her from what I learned from your Channel that your not supposed to SCRAPE THE SIDES because there is unmixed resin so tell me if this is smart or not that she actually SCRAPE THE SIDES!!!
please, PLEASE update us on the nuggets as they... progress. I have morbid curiosity about how pumpkin-like it will turn out
Ooh you guys should make a resin lamp, and flock parts of it!
Oh yes! Can you please make a series of fan based cursed creations?! This is hilarious
Joobie nuzzling against Mini Joob was the most wholesome thing I've ever seen, and I will die for Mini Joob
Why do I actually like the bean board
A felted hairbrush still seems like a bad idea, but definitely better than the toothbrush. Just throwing that out there.
Why does the bean board look like Minecraft lava? Hello??
Charcuter-bean board
Resin pizza shirt/shoes 🤣
Fun cat fact: black cats aren't black. They are a very deep brown that looks black.
How could you do that to Joob?  Voodoo Joob doll! :P
Charcuterbean board
Y'all they make molds you can buy to make resin nuggets lmao
Reminder that it's not food safe to eat off of resin objects, regardless of what you see folks do on the internet. Serving trays and cheese boards are just fine since you won't be cutting on them, but if you intend to use a fork, a knife, a spoon, or serving utensils on an object it should NOT contain any resin on your cutting/usage surface.
I thought they were going to try to cook chicken on a rotisserie using the heat from resin curing😂 compared to that, chicken nugget resin earrings is not so bad!
For the hot glue, you could use the hot end to come back and clean it up or a soldering iron.
you use groud to my understanding so it can still move
I really enjoyed the videos where you found cool items online (like the cloud and the lamps) and then reverse engineered them for (occasionally) cheaper and would love to see more of those videos this year!
nothing like having to de-bean your cutting board. modern technology has come a long way.
Have you ever worked with stabilizing resin? Seems like it would be a better way to make lasting chicken nugget resin projects. I'd really like to see a real immortal chicken nugget.
That is 100% not a cutting board. It's WAYYY too small. What it ISN'T too small for, however, is a paddle. "Not that kind of show." Uh hu. Suuurrreeeee.... "Smooth side... textured side...." uh hu...
Submission: "You should do a velvet toothbrush! Don't do the brush area though." The thumbnail: we flocked a toothbrushes bristles with velvet :) The video: or did we?
freeze drying foods could help with the molding aspects of the food because no water no environment no bacteria growth
i can’t believe i’m saying this, but i kind of want a bean cutting board now 🤔
bacon bracelet
resin cowboy hat for cat
Anytime you make something velvet it’s so nostalgic for me cuz I found y’all through your velvet keyboard video! Also I love the cat hair needle felting! It came out so cute and it seems resourceful 🤷‍♀️ like something a crafter from ye olden days would do lol 😂 plus I think since it smelled like herself, joob was drawn to it?
Here is an idea for you!❤ 1.ham depender for your cat you can decorate it shape it like a cat whatever!
Some cursed ideas  Resin headstones  Mood earrings/cursed things Make a picture with layers of wood, color with resin Fake spilled beans with cat toe beans imprinted  Velvet phone case 5 minute craft art tutorial with resin Bean juice art A clock that screams don't forget mold release every 6 hours Resin house for Joob
Enan, you are one lucky dog, Kaitlin is an absolute smoke show 😍🔥🔥😍. You guys make such a cute couple. You're PERFECT for each other. LOVE your channel ❤️ Take care..... ~Jonny5🥁
You should velvet the teeth !
Hey, why not try some more dice stuff, like petri dish or liquid core? They're really cool and I think you guys would have a lot of fun
You should do painting with Joob! It's safe just use egg based paint and there are some methods where she doesn't need to get any pant on her! 😁 You could even make it Bob Ross themed
Joobie was cuteness OVERLOAD...!!!!! SOOOOOOO CUTE. and there are batter operated hot glue guns...... Just putting that out there 👍👍
the waffle house has found its new host
Now flock the cutting board.
This is such a high quality video! I've been a fan of your channel for a couple years and you all are doing so amazing 🤩
when katelyn was picking up the beans i thougt that she was going to eat them
Bro SO CUTE!  :3 <3
The velvet kinda looks like spicy Cheeto puffs... Normal Cheeto puffs covered in velvet powder and prank your family? But like don’t actually let them eat it 😳
They would never do that bcs they don't have access to a baby, not bcs it might be difficult to make a cast of a baby.
I like that the resin baby creation rests on just having access to a baby. 😂
KATELYN!!! Thank you for being open about keeping Joob hair, I’ve been collecting fur from brushing my cat so I could make something from her fur when she passes. People have told me it’s weird but this made me feel so much better 🥹
I've needle felted my cats hair. it works best with long hair cats like Joob :D
Do you think that the chicken nugget jewelry got spoil.. or what?? 😅
Honestly didn't know Yahoo mail was still a thing. Yikes
this was really fun!! there is glitter particals you can add to traditional grout tho!!! so you can do glitter grout
The only thing I can imagine during the chicken nugget section is one chicken going to a psychic chicken to learn about their future when they see this 7:41
"Cast a baby in resin. And we would never do that; we don't have access to a baby"  I love how subtlety loud that is
The Waffle House has found its new host
Flock the teeth
This has bean an amazing video! :)
This was quite a ride, would love a part 2 sometime!
Just a tip, get leather finger protectors for needle felting. They're a game changer. (they stop you from stabbing your fingers)
YOU KNOW THOSE TINY PLASTIC BABIES? YOU SHOULD MAKE SOAP WITH THEM IN IT
My cat is literally right next to me and is like what is this screaming about 😂
This need to be a series
Joob is gonna wash that baby whether it wants to be washed or not.
you guys should make a resin bean bowl to eat beans in
this seems to be a doomed craft.  With that metal rod poking from the outside through the resin into the nugget it seems unlikely that the nugget in sealed enough away from the environment that it wouldn't be a breeding ground for some nasty stuff.  Of course that would only be a huge issue if they were serious about going around with a chicken nugget fashion statement.
I love everything about this video 💜
you cut off the resin time song and i got concerned
Omg when Katelyn said they'd never cast a baby in resin...they don't have access to one...I almost died 💀🤣
The cat hair one be like   Joob: “don’t talk to me or my child again” 😂😂
Joobie Jr was my favorite, though bean board was pretty great too
the velvet tooth brush hurts my teeth just looking at it
Glitter grout is a thing though
Saying you can't have glitter grout when Epoxy grout exists... It has glitter and is more durable than regular grout. Also comes in all colors and with large glitter, small glitter, shimmer and metallic. I worked at a tile and bathroom shop for a year and yeah, it exists.
actually glitter grout is now a thing. I can see someone using hotglue to grout if say a tile popped up in a rental and you're moving and don't wanna lose a security desposit though
The Waffle House has found its new host
Me (minute 8:43 ): That's enough YouTube for today!
I love this channel.
Beaning board
Why can't you put glitter in your grout?
The fluffy toothbrush but instead of velvet, static grass.
I love your helmet thing
Yay! You put dead chicken body parts in resin! how fun and unique!
I feel like plastic beans go against the spirit of the beans. Still, weirdly aesthetic!
I love that you guys show yourselves using PPE. Safety is cool!!!
Mini-me and I sing "[var-ly] Time, do do do do" whenever it's time for something that scans to "Resin", now.  I think we're all clear who to blame.
Katelyn,you really need to check out Mia Maples, she did Glitter grout in her bathroom remodeling  videos.  She did both of her bathrooms with it
Just the thought of a velvet toothbrush is making my teeth hurt 😅 how gloriously chaotic
Why did I have to eat breakfast while watching this
I am wondering one thing, is that resin food safe?
The beans look way more real when you don't paint them. When you made the beans phone case, and you painted the beans, it kinda just made it look like the tomato sauce was all dried up and crusty like it had been sitting on a counter for weeks. Real baked beans don't have a crust of dried up sauce, it's all liquid. The ratio of beans to sauce in this one also looks accurate to real life, it looks very convincing. And I think the plastic beans look more real than the dried ones, because dried beans don't have that wet shiny look to them.
I’m so happy to see the surfing board mold in use again😂
I  had always heard that resin is toxic and should not be made into food prep items.. loved all the projects though!
I LOVE the Cat Hair Toy Joob! I wonder if she thought it was her baby? Smells like cat, looks like little cat, must be baby? Adorable.  I definitely thought the toothbrush suggestion was saying "Not anywhere around the bristles - as in not where the toothbrush will enter the mouth"  - imagine an electric toothbrush head attachment vs body. Only flock the body lol
watching this while eating beans
The Waffle House has found it's new host.
I would absolutely wear the chicken nugget jewelry.
Bean cutting board well then maybe bean plate and silver wair??
Idea: make a half velvet half NOT velvit mug, but u will prob not do it :(
Love the chopping board! A chopping board that looks like a bean spill might be fun.
I love the bean-board so much...would definitly buy it!
Please start selling those beans cutting boards.  With the power of quantity it can be as low as 10$ each
Hold on so for the bean cutting board for each plastic bean bags cost $50.00!!!!!thats crazy
Can't wait for the "diy teeth" video
I thought when you guys got the fake teeth, you would make a resin dentures, with each individual tooth having different colors/design resin.
Is resin food safe?
the bean board looks like Minecraft lava
I'm more concerned that you collected your cats hair for an idea u didn't have...
Noted....do not let you guys babysit. Because that would give you access to casting a resin baby. Got it.
Couple goals? Timed out poops together?
What about using that heat changing paint you used to make the mood ring toilet seat to make a mood ring couch or computer chair🤔 or try and make one of those CMY cubes using resin
I think you can put glitter in grout actually!
BEAN DICE BEAN DICE BEAN DICE
Im Totally into seeing a chair made out of beans! lol
2:22 Fed Ex in a nutshell lol
Lil joob would be a great Christmas tree decoration
I could be mistaken, but I believe there's a book about needle felting cat hair! I want to say I watched Mariah Elizabeth do it a while back!
omg I'm dying with the eye makeup sausage. the orange crackers on the charcuterie plate were a nice touch.
Is resing safe for food?
The nuggets look like orangey nebula
I think you should have flocked the handle of the toothbrush only and then resin coated it.
The waffle House has found its new host
Not me hoping the teeth were going to get flocked... I'm sadly disappointed without a fuzzy set of fake teeth
Ngl I thought yahoo was dead
A permanent thing katelyn and Evan have brought to my life is I always refer to this orange colors as baked bean orange now
For some reason I thought they were gonna fly the gums of the fake teeth and idk why I thought that
Great video as a builder I'd like to say you can get glitter in your grout instead of using a pump tube of grout you need a tub of clear grout then mix in glitter a apply it with a float I've done it a couple time it works try it
I know chick fil a nuggets when I see them
I'd just like to add glitter grout mix does exist in many colors
Joob voodoo doll
Pat the beans
Somebody get @miamaples in here for that glitter grout.
The fake teeth holding the toothbrush made me uncomfortable.
The beans poking up in a cluster grosses me out for some reason. Lol. I don’t know why?
A velvet tooth brush is about as bad as chunky style milk.😝
i love watching this channel while doing something else because ill look up and you guys are making something completely random haha
omg when Katelyn said "Flock a Toothbrush", did anyone else get a jarring flashback to 2016 and that one Tana Mongeau storytime?? 😭
ok i think you guys should try to make paper from like, cut up paper, ya know? but like make it weird and wonderful, with a touch of cursed. please!!!!! i would honestly love to see that
Oh my gosh z when I saw the 11:26 thing it was exactly 11:26 for me too 😭
Can we get a joob update with her new joob fur toy?
18:21 *causally puts finger in mouth*
Look for the book called "Crafting with Cat Hair" by Kaori Tsuaya for more cat hair ideas XD
Omg Katyln’s Catitude 💀 best human meow I’ve ever heard 😆🖤
A resin hat
You two were killing me with the tile, HEAT GUN IT! That would have remelted it perfectly. Still enjoyed watching.
Since you also flocked a toilet seat you should flock an entire bathroom
You can get glitter grout! The marvels of technology!
You keep saying “we’re not that type of channel” and yet every video……..
The bean cutting board looks like peanut brittle ! Very appetizing lol
I like how you said "we would never do that to a baby, we don't have access to a baby" as if if you did you would cast it it resin 🤣🤣
After watching the needle felting I have to keep repeating to myself "I don't need another art project."
I have a title without a concept, but I think the duo could run (or swim) with it.  "Shark-cuterie Board".
28:28  minecraft lava be like:
...Is the resin board safe?
Y’all truly make me laugh even just your ads you make 😂 thank you for sharing!!
You never heard of, undo?
Ok!  Joob toy is perfect!  I love it so much!  And Joob cuddling her namesake was precious!
Heat-gunning for the hot glue to have more control and even it, would that work?
Hear me-owt. Flaming Hot Cheeto  Sharkudary board
YouTuber Mia Maple has tried glitter gout multiple times…guess she just needed to use glue :P
"DI-WHY-ideas."
I think she thinks  it her fur baby🥺
I love that I also have a black cat who we call the supervisor, except my cats name is Bert. He has to make sure we are all doing our jobs right.if we have a person over at our house to fix something he is right with the supervising
Dear Evan and Katelyn, As a loyal viewer of your various channels and streams, I come to you today with this humble request: Please consider referring to the resin rotisserie as the restisserie. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Entertaining n funny but wasteful n on the ridiculous side. LOL 🤍🙏🏼🕊
Someone needs to send them a sign that says, " did you level it? "
Probably going to regret this… but now I kinda want to see a Bean/Resin Toilet seat… Love your channel, guys!!! ❤️❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Here's another cursed project idea: baked beans resin dice set.
Why don't you get a Motorized Hot Melt Glue Gun - Motor Driven it would be easier
ideas for the channel, do some outdoor stuff or go places to diy or help people, do more furniture inside the house or outside, home decor stuff, learn about obscure/wacky techniques, cooking, computer stuff like building cases or repurposing pc/tv/radio cases or bases, car/bike related tech or diy.   just some ideas to help you guys and grab a broad demographic.  much love from a long time fan, hope to see what you come up with!
well now yo have to carefully flock teeth
Haven't you learned not to put perishable food in resin
So cute to see Joobie loving your little mini Joob creation so much
It's ridiculous how feltable cat hair is lol. I think you could felt dog hair too but cat hair is ssooooo much better for the job. I've learned this from years of animal sitting and trying to make balls of fur with all the varies types of hair I take off my pants lmao.
The waffle house has found it's new host
Nah because all these bad ideas on my thoughts when I’m trying to go to sleep on a work night
The felted cat fur smells like pack to Joob xD Whether you like it or not, that is her new sibling 😂
I am just watching this while needle felting with our dogs hair, you made my day :)
Nice shirts 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
as a tile contractor I can tell you glitter grout is a real thing, and its awful.
Why not use a heat gun for the hot glue grout so it sinks to the bottom and smooths itself by liquifying it?
PLEASE do a part 2 I BEG OF YOU
chaos idea. flok the teeth...
Please don't use hot glue for 'grout'. We bought a house where someone had decided to 'repair' the grout on the tile countertops with caulk. But once that caulk (or glue...) cracks it leaves all kind of bacteria and dirt catching cracks. Use grout unless you don't want it to last.
Thinking of the velvet toothbrush makes me want to crawl outside of my skin. 🙃☠️
Cannon playing in the background while looking at the bean cutting board was amazing 😂 cannon was the song I walked down the aisle to at my wedding and I just don’t know if that can compete with bean cutting board
HE FLOCKED ME WITH A TOOTHBRUSH!!
There actually is glitter grout So you CAN do glittery grout instead of hot glue still! but these are great to watch. Thank you for making stuff so we can watch it and not do it, unless..... <3
how about a velvet glass or cup? so that only the lower half would be velvet
“I hope you know you called while we’re doing very important business things” “Thank you!” “Alright, bye” lmAO
As a joke I am getting a nugget chain on on my next date I will speak like I am Australian and talk about my Gold Nuggy all date.  Just for fun.
Omg you guys should velvet the teeth
Tape method works great for caulk as well, can set the width and keeps the lines neat
flock the teeth.
:D i love ur videos so much! You guys are definitley one of the funniest yters i watch
She’s going to smell her fur and think it’s her child
The nugget necklace remember me something, it was someone was making jewlery with moose doo doo...
It actually makes me a bit sad to see this, the chicken nugget will be nasty and moldy within months all while being avoidable damage to the environment because they've already done videos casting raw veg in resin, like we already know the result. we know it molds and becomes distgusting, now we have a random resin covered moldy chicken nugget floating around
Idea for you 💡 you should make velvet glasses frames or your own resin glasses frames 😎 🙏💖
Did anyone notice that Katlyn was perfectly in sync with the music 11:03 to 11:07. I’ve watched it like 100 times and I can’t stop laughing..😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
im pretty sure fully black wool like the one you had is dyed to be fully black, since the wool gets both bleached from the sun and usually black animals' fur isnt fully black, so the hair you got from joob is basically the same colour you would get directly from a sheep if you sheared it.
I did the needle thing with my dogs hair.. worked well but since it is hairy I just washed them aggressibely with soap and shaped it meanwhile, I would do that before attaching the pieces
The super sweet elderly lady that lived next door to me made earrings & necklaces out of potatoes. They were cute & I've had them for 15 years & they haven't changed (i.e. rotted, shriveled) a bit! She didn't even coat them in resin, just dried them & painted them.
Now imagine project 1 but with dino nuggies instead
I eagerly await the felting video on channel 2, having just delved into needle-felting myself!
You guys do the 5min craft/troomtroom stuff except actually funny and good. 🤣
What brand of resin was the cutting board made with, or charcuterie board?
You should have put catnip or something in the little cat cat toy
Flock the teeth from the demonstration.
I bet you could use crystal clear gorilla glue or clear construction adhesive as a decent grout. Clear silicone would probably work too.
This intro... cinematic masterpiece
FLOCK THE TEETH
FLOCK THE TEETH!
I got a bad idea! Make a velvet toilet brush!
Why is nobody talking about how good they look in the last scene!!
You should try making a resin supurrrviser (joobie) 🖤
Hey... make sure to use food safe resin when doing stuff that you are putting food on top of
... The needle felting is somehow the MOST successful cat related craft this far. They've made her sO MANY THINGS and of course the most simple one made out of her own fur gets the most supervisor approval. Remote controlled cat bed? Takes 30 years to get used to. Needle felted cat toy? Instant love.
Flock the teeth! Flock the teeth! Flock the teeth! Flock the teeth! Flock the teeth!
Hiii I actually have a request! Could you try making rocking dining chairs? I have ADHD, like a lot of people do, and one of my worst fidgets is rocking back in forth. It's literally breaking dining chairs and squeaking them and just ruining them, and the worst part is I never realize I'm doing it until it's pointed out. And I'm sure a lot of people have the same problem. I think it could really help people to do so and you're one of the people I think are crazy enough to pull it off! Please help the neurodivergent community with getting dining chairs that rock so if we get the impulse we don't gotta worry about breaking things due to lack of impulse control with our fidgeting.
I have multiple cats, and have a needle felting kit, oh no, I must do mini cats now, YES
wait.... yahoo mail? YAHOO IS STILL A THING? What next? a myspace sponsor?
Why can't you add glitter to grout?
Y’all wondering if you can do felt crafts with cat hair…. You need the “Crafting with cat hair” book! 😂
Those beans look like lava from minecraft.
"we are not crazy people" haha good one
Bean plate, bean cutlery bean cup
When you said there has been an error with the chicken, nugget jewelry I thought they went moldy
1:16 "my brain is no longer able to separate whats a good idea from a bad idea"  1:35 "we would never do that, we dont have access to a baby" is that the only reason cause your brain seems to really not understand what a bad idea is
You know, now that you have a set of dentures. You could flock the teeth I red velvet.
OH MY GOSH!  At the very end with the outtakes, when Katelyn makes that meow noise, my cat had just walked in the room and he responded to her meow with a meow of his own!  And even funnier, he is a floofy black cat who looks a LOT like Joob.
I really wanted to see mood ring trousers.☹️ Just think about it , it would be epic
Hey y’all! You guys should make another video about recipes you made/like! Like in your cooking vids!
If you ever remodel a kitchen or bathroom they make glitter grout
Dye Joob using vanta black, then she can be VantaCat... I'll get my coat.
The fact that you didn’t use dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets makes me literally angry. 😂😂😂 Seriously though, thanks for the laughs!
I am so fricken happy every time i see there's a new e&k video T_T
Bros got sponsored by yahoo lmao, find that funny
I might personally put the chicken through a dehydrator before covering it in resin, but they look lovely <3  She thinks you alchemy'd her a baby cat. That's dirty and needs a bath.
That is a barbecute if I have ever seen one
I do really miss the home stuff you guys would do!
Like, do you guys take out the fancy bean things you made when hosting guests too or is it just for yourself 👀😂?
Wow.  Now THAT'S a parade of really awful ideas.  Nicely done.
Resin time resin time do do do do resin time!
Since you have the teeth, Now I want to see you make resin teeth.
you should make a velvet toothbrush but only the handle is velvet.
flock a chicken nugget and thats a good and bad idea
just FY... they make glitter grout. It is actually pretty common for glass tiles.
I need you two to go to a McDonalds and go inside to order as many McNuggets as you can while wearing that jewelry (at least the pendants!).
Just like Joob's fur, my cat Spoof (who, might I add, looks very similar to Joob!) is a black cat, but his fur always comes off silver whenever I brush him! Weird right?
Here are a bunch of interesting ideas that are up your ally. Can you eat off of resin? You could make resin galaxy dinner ware like plates and cups and glasses. Galaxy resin wine glasses. DIY shag rug with different colors, or a Joob pattern in it. DyI light sconces and light shades. Light lamp shades that change color with LED's.  Floor Led lights as a chaser toy for Joob down the hall (like a landing strip).  Crystal bonsai tree making.  Wire jewelry. Matching resin rings.  You could make some of your favorite game characters out of resin or other materials.  making resin dragon eggs from Minecraft. Galaxy resin sunglasses frames. Velvet flocking sun glasses frames.  tie dye bathroom rug, towels, shower curtain.  Fake fish tank salad bowl out of resin. Galaxy resin dyi lava lamp. Hot glue glitter Halloween spiderweb decorations.
1:40 Never realized how much Evan sounds like Dan Povenmire.
Bean cutting board is ate/10 lol! You could pour some clear over the bumpy side to retain the visual depth and texture of the beans, but also have a flat surface.
Yahoo really do be desperately trying to stay relevant
My mom had gotten a very realistic baby doll to use as baby Jesus for their church Christmas party in case the real baby didn't work out. You could also acquire a not real baby to cast. (I am a mother, and I approve of my own comment) Real babies move around too much.
The bean one actually made me question why I watch this channel.
on hot glue grout, you can use a bladed scraper to remove the excess after it's dry, and also use the hot nib on the glue gun to shape it in the gap.
During the ad read I almost fell off my chair in laughter when I saw Katelyn running down a field with a giant box in her hand then launches the box. I replayed that a bunch of times. So funny.
Why does the bean cutting board look like either mincraft lava or like they photoshopped beans on it? 🤣
I wonder if you guys found out that there is actually glitterized grout. There's also metallic grouts, and other colored ones to fit with various design aesthetics.
The bean board looks like lave. 😂
I hate to admit that...the beancutterie board isnt actually half bad. Its very...unique but it really does look like a fun conversation piece. The mini Joob is perfect too, please make more.
Next time try your hand with miniatures or maybe even dioramas
This was an especially good video =P And high-effort: 5 projects in one video!
lots of projects in only one video? that was the biggest rush of endorphins I had in a while!!! 🤣
I've seen a tiktok where the person was applying a glittering golden grout, don't know if its a thing or not
cat tank that shoots balls of ham
Well. I mean. You COULD make a resin pair of undies to put up as a decoration. I imagined a pair of rainbow tie dye boxers made of resin, stuck in a picture frame to hang in a hallway somewhere.
Now I want you guys to make dolls that look like each other and repurpose those teeth with the dolls. lol Kind of like the dolls called Fugglers. I just know they would be amazingly cursed 😍😂
Little Joobie's so cute!! Big Joob's approval was PRECIOUS.
loved the tiefye video
Joob is treating her new toy like a baby thats so adorable its because she reconizes it smells like a cat her mothering insticts came out in the toy project
The bean board would have been so cool if you'd do like a thinner layer of the resin and beans, then go back in the same mold and do a little layer of resin over it. flip it and do another small sealing in layer.
For the hot glue grout, you could have flattened it with the end of the glue gun or a heat gun and a razor scraper!!
You guys should try dollar tree resin. Or just do a dollar tree project
Can you make a resin mouse?
tiny joob is like joob's kitten
Bean board for the esty store win!
So there is glitter grout. :) we used it in our bathroom shower.
I would have an idea based on that you one did kitchen knives out of resin, how about making a full cutlery set out of resin, or decorate the cutlery handles.  Maybe Joob themed.
gutantag
*Joobie loves*

Can you guys make a door out of resin?
This reminded me of Threadbanger's old making a cat hat out of cat hair video
People actually use yahoo mail?
Okay now can we do cursed velvet gums and  for the cursed velvet toothbrush?
Honestly, I feel like the hot glue grouting could be really fun in a small crafting project, like if you’re doing a 2 x 2 mini tile mural or something (especially with kids, with obvious assistance using the glue gun). It honestly reminds me of the stuff the library program I went to as a kid did. Geez, there’s the nostalgia…
No Dino nuggies? 🥺
The arm-in-arm skip to go poop at the same time was everything.
Glitter actually can be used in grout (usually for glass mosaics), but it’s very rare. I’ve only heard of one person using it regularly.
Oh to be a chicken nugget rotisserie-ing during resin time
Why not make a silicone insert for the vacuum chamber so if the resin overflows you can take out the insert to clean it instead of the entire chamber.
13:54 She probably thinks it's a very tiny kitten
I’ve been keeping a bag of my puppy’s fur, separated by color, to make a miniature of her. I’m so glad I don’t feel so weird anymore!
Is buttcheeks one word? Or should I spread them apart?
Replace all the doorknobs and/or cabinet handles in your house to be made out of Resin!!!
The bean board looks like minecraft lava
You should just make a whole cutlery set of beans at this point completed with a plate made of beans
Is resin foodsafe? I didn't think that it was..
This intro is absurd. Everyone knows ladies don’t poop, and katelyn is a lady.  Edit: originally I said Katelyn was a lady before seeing that she collects her cats hair….I need to rethink some things
the mini joob reminds of SpongeBob's eyelash sweater
I’m glad I didn’t stayed through the ad to see a plastic joob paw smacking the email in
Grout actually comes in colours an different glitters, Mia Maples actually use it in a vid
I know there's a book to make a lot of small cute things with cat and dog hair, would be cool to see more!
You should have cut the pendant in half and make a hing so it could be a locket. Then you could put your guys pictures inside it.
Velvet Toothbrush sounds like a high school garage band.
You could do bending resin art, inspired by the charcuterie board😯
This makes me want to try needle-felting with my rabbits' fur!
haha Oh my gosh, I literally just made a cat toy for my cats out of one of my cat's fur and it's legit their favourite toy.
HIGHLY SENSUAL BEAN PATTING
if you did clear hot glue as grout you could even put an rgb strip between the tiles  :O
a tip for making hot glue come out faster/in one, if possible, instead of pulling the glue gun trigger several times, hold it down and push the end glue stick with your other hand, as long as the trigger is held down, the glue stick will slide through smoothly
1:39 I love that they wouldn’t do it only because they don’t have a baby, implying that they would if they did have a baby
honestly.. i would have suggested a joobie shaped soap
Please, get access to a baby. *I want to see you duplicate a baby.*
Idea #1 is all about that Nugg life!
How does Katelyn not know about glitter grout?
can you do something out of HDPE
Safety concerns, please don't eat (or even cut) on resin  otherwise cool video and funny bloopers, as always :)
0:06 Bamboo shoot tempura = deep fried wood
Maybe make a resin bean counter top.
I will definitely be using the hot glue grout to make some photography backgrounds for my small business! Thank you!  p.s. Hemway sell Glitter grout :)
Elmo's toothbrush
For some reason the velvet toothbrush somehow reminds me of cat in the hat. I don't know why 🤷🏻‍♂️
I've never seen you both so dressed up! What a lovely couple :]
I legit got jump-scared by the "dancing" chicken nugget. I need to go to sleep.
I wonder if Joob thought she had a kitten for a second :3 she is much too smart to obviously entirely fall for it
💖💖
Are you sure you can't add glitter in grout ? XD
RE your sponsor - I met my wife (financial manager) in yahoo chat rooms, 23 years ago...
Please tell me you put the extra resiny beans into little piles to cure and become bean jewellery? 😂
I know McDonald’s chicken nuggets when I see one. 😂 & now I want that necklace. Cursed but worth it. ❤
When they were spinning those chicken nuggets I thought evan said its "Dressing time" and I thight for a solid 3 seconds that they were going to put salad dressing toppings on the rotating chicken nuggets and got excited :(
The ONLY toy my cat will play with is felted balls made from his own fur. He’s an adorable weirdo.
26:00 - 27:00 see this is EXACTLY why the saying “woman are always right” exists even 😂😂😂 katelyn told you so
17 chetomznkanza
The velvet toothbrush looks like a hot cheeto
So I'm getting from this that the key to gaining Supurrvisor approval on projects is to use only the very highest quality material available on the planet... herself. This was just the right amount of fun and silliness in a video :) Some of the experiments came out surprisingly well. My favourites were tiny Joob and the Baked Bean Board. Also I absolutely winced in sympathy with Katelyn's ears trying on those nugget earrings. Ouch!
My ears , are in pain
where my dino nuggies at
dont like the reminder that this video is sponsored, thats cringe aggressive marketing , hate that they made you do that
Why CAN'T you mix glitter into grout?
Oh nooooo you guys should have done moulds of the chicken nuggets first  I think. And don't quote me on this but glitter grout I think does exist maybe
Ok so now are we gonna do resin salami jewellery? Or charcuterie but encased in resin and immortalised ✨forever✨ 😂
0:28 just do Ctrl+Z
The cat fur reminds me of when I realized my grey tabby cat was actually brown lol
Actually glitter grout does exist 😂
Glitter grout is actually a thing sold at stores now!
If anyone is wondering what the song was, it's Pachelbel's canon in D
I wonder if you guys had used a pressure pot on the phone beans if it would have driven the resin into the beans.and maybe prevented chipping? Or maybe a layer of clear coat to beef up the outer bean shell.
Glitter grout is a thing. Mia Maples tried it on her channel! Would love to see you try that!
Make a cat statue out of resin
They should have used Dino nuggets for the earrings
Gosh, that might be the most excited I've ever seen Joob get over a project. That's so adorable~!
Diy teeth, cactus for humans and chair made of beans Katelyn, did you write this?
Have you guys tried sculpting with clay? :b love you're vids!
Just wait till they find out about glitter grout lol fantastic vid as always 💕
18:20 idk why it was weirdly adorable that evan didnt Evan didnt even flinch like it was a completely unsurprising "Ah yeah sure do compare" 🤣🤣🤣
stop, im only now realized that you made a woodoo stuff
My 4 y.o. son Kion, who's "knees deep" into the poop phase, wants me to submit his idea: A fully functioning resin toilet!! 🤭  He just loves your channel and despite him having ADHD (like me) he sits glued to the sofa when we watch your videos! We both love seeing how things work and are made and I have to admit, I'm kinda curious to know what it would look like 😅
2:21 “Your favourite shipping company”
Part 2 please!!!! I enjoyed this so much!!
What is joob thinks its her kitten😭
J: "You should go flock yourselves" Best video idea ever 🤣👌
Katelyn: "Would you care to open up the cheeks?" Evan: 😏
They make glitter grout
You guys don't brush your teeth with toothpaste? Love your vids btw ❤
VELVET TEETH
Now you need to felt the teeth! awesome video, please felt the teeth
How about making a resin chandelier?
those nuggets in resin kinda look like amber
Now I wanna see y'all make a larger version of the felt Joob. Like kitten sized.
The jub toy looks like a Minecraft cat 🐈
Was that ideas list made up, or an excerpt of your actual list? XD
how are you liking the pixel 7 boy?
Velvet teeth?
I love how she threw that box I can't help but scream laff 🤣🤣🤣
Flock the teeth.
What about a phone case but the  resin has to be thin enough that your touches still register and have all the required port holes accessible too.
I think if you stabbed the nuggets with many needles first it could make them stick better. I
Thanks, I hate it.
Nooooo! Cast the chicken nuggets next time!  Then we get the texture
I thought they were gonna make velvet teeth😂😂😂 I didn’t see the toothbrush in the thumbnail😂
so like, resin gloves don't make much sense, but what about a resin armor?
I really wanted them to crochet a cursed fishing line hat.
idk why but the image of the little nugget struggling to rotate was so disturbing to me 😂 really don't know why tho
This made me snort a lot!
Burger King Bling
This is a long shot but what's the music playing at 6:36? I couldn't find it in the description. 😅
Nug Life
2M subs resin baby or bust
see, I watched this video as soon as I got a notification for its upload, regardless of the fact that it was past my bedtime... but still the only thing I can think of is that the music when reviewing the bean board is my favorite classical piece.. and that I can still recognize that piece when it's 11pm.. good taste though.
If you have an outdoor area in the new place, you should see if you are able to make that fireplace you wanted to make in the zombie weapon video a few years ago. Been waiting to see if would make it for year's.
Joob toy was honestly a 10/10.
make "chainmail" armor out of resin.
Kind of morbid when you think about ist … having chicken corps dangeling on your ears 🙈
I was wondering why experienced YouTubers had an @yahoo email address in the 2020s 🙃
I've always wondered why modern western homes have double sinks yet not double toilets.  I feel like the likelihood of us both needing to go at the same time is higher than the likelihood of us both needing to brush our teeth or wash hands is less likely.
the cat hair felting turned out so good!!! i loved that one :)
Boyfriends idea: beans keyboard
will chicken nuggets make good rice crispy treats?
Still waiting for those resin butt stools that y’all promised!!!!! 😂😂😂
I was in a books-a-million one time where I happened to see an entire book about felting with cat hair, so when ya'll asked "I wonder if this will even work?" I unfortunately already knew...
the whoe time you were working with the nuggets my mouth was watering haha
Make the teeth velvet
Guys you might do thrift flips that jube will like to see if she approves them 🐈‍⬛
For resin time. 4:02
This was so fun I hope you do another round of cursed crafts in a future video!
all of the suggestions at the start got me laughing so hard LOLLL 😭😭
Juet because you can doesn't nean you should
You should have scrapped the glue when it dried for the grout with a razor blade
Yahoo mail. Did Evan and Katelyn build a time machine!?
Cook food with resin 🫠
You have the teeth now. Now you must flock the teeth.
Nice video  Had to laugh  As for using the cat hair  I use the cat hair I brush off my cats a different way  I tie flies , so I use the different colors to form bodies for flies
There is even a book for felting with cat hair!
Can you refill the flocking puffer with the stuff in the tote or could you just sprinkle it on?
They almost have the cursed velvet bathroom set!😂😂😂
I want a whole dish set of bean resin 😂 I’m talking bowls, plates, spoons, utensils, basic kitchen stuff 😂😂
Im dying that toy is toooooo cute!
Yahoo really glowed up and I am here for it
I think Joobie needs a friend 🥺 She probably thought the toy was another little cat and tried to groom it ♥️😞
Joobie loved the kitty toy cause she thought it was a kitten 🥹🥹
I thought you were going to flock the teeth. What the flock?  Loved the cat fur cat toy. I actually didn't mind the smooth side of the chopping board. I wouldn't use it, but it would be good for a quirky display chopping board. :)
The clear hot glue grout, LEDs underneath…. Instant win.
These videos are so cursed they are brilliant. Love your out the box videos 😂❤
You should have used gold glitter instead of silver. The gold would have made it look like it just came out of the fryer.
Evan looks baller in that chai
That intro was some S tier stuff 😂
I would love to see you guys make a bowl out of beans.
More like DIWHY, amirite?
How dare you not do Dinosaur nuggies 🦕🦕🦖. Jkjk awesome video as always guy
Y'all should do a Bob Ross wall mural. 🧱
I would love to see you guys make some more custom cat furniture and climbing towers.
I have actually seen white grout with glitter and black / dark gray grout with glitter. It's pretty looking, but a nightmare to clean and always look a bit dirty.
Watching them needle felt the cat hair made me sneeze so much. Im not even alurgic to cats! Just a virtual placibo affect lol
I've had several black cats, the hair being lighter isn't as weird as you think. Cats sunbathe!! The sun lightens the fur, like my very first black cat was an indoor/outdoor cat and in the summer he'd literally turn dark chocolatey brown because of how much sun he got, especially his neck ruffle of fur!!
19:19 I would like to point out that she did not say “It’s not that type of channel.” Therefore implying it is that type of channel.
Can you do resin with things like peanut butter, jam , ketchup etc . See how they colour it and does it smell etc.
Will Ya'll be taking more ideas and creating them again? This was fantastic and I loved it 😂
HE FLOCKED ME WITH A TOOTHBRUSH
So, as a cat owner and a needle felter, I can tell you that cats LOVE anything needle felted. Like, in a crazy insane way. My cat will find anything needle felted in his general vicinity. I have tried to hide many a felted item from him, but he WILL find it. It’s like a cat magnet. And my friends who own cats also tell me that their cats also go nuts for anything needle felted that I have given them.
You should have freeze dried the chicken nuggets or any other food items before covering them in resin so they get preserved for longer
You guys should do more buy versus DIYs. Those are always interesting and easy to follow
Oh hey! I have those same teeth! .....It feels weird to say that.
Joobie is a mother now
There is glitter grout. You just add it to the grout and then its caked in glitter in-between the tiles. Look at mia Maples bathroom remodel and she used glitter grout in her shower
As a person with one bathroom I can attest to couples needing the toilet at the same time xD
The reason behind not casting a baby was merely that they didn’t have a baby, not that it’s unethical to indeed cast a baby. Ha ha
Hi the last one is the best it looks like bankbeans .
Top Job 🤘
*Gasp* FELT BOB ROSS
I don't think I will ever not have a visceral reaction to the bean resin look.
28:48 imagine having a job where 'Date Night' can be classified as a business expense..... 😂😂
22:23 glitter that you add to grout is a thing that actually exists, idk if it actually works well tho, and it's kind of expensive
I think it would be kind of interesting if you used a freeze dryer when trying to put resin on the food products
Yahoo mail!? I thought Yahoo went out of business years ago...
The chicken died to be wasted in resin and tossed away. You will never RIP poor tortured chicken, humans are a waste of space...
With the thumbnail, I legitimately thought they were going to velvet the fake teeth. XD
you have to eat watermelon while showing off those chicken nuggets earrings...lol
i entirely believed yall were gonna flock the teeth
Now hear me out. The koi pond painted layered art but with joobs in space instead of the koi in a pond.
No pet owner likes to talk about it but pets don't live very long. That felt cat is actually a cool way to keep a memento of your cat or dog.
Okay a human sized cat-cus though?? I need to see that!
I imagine Evan & Katelyn inviting their friends and family to a nice sophisticated dinner at their house and brining out that bean chopping board 😂
reckon Joob thinks that the diddy Joob is her baby cause it smells like her?......uh-oh, is Jooby getting broody? can Joob have babas you two? im curious, be uber cute to see diddy Joobs running around again :) x
Soo.. Next is flocked tile grouted with glitter hot glue? 🤣❤️
Okay, I was just watching a snake discovery video and then you talk about cursed ideas and I thought cricket leg rice krispies. I am late so hopefully you miss this.
E&K I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE SOMETHING FOR MY FRIEND.  She lost her baby boy- tomorrow is act one year.... and i am trying to find something she can Use to gift him teddy bears bt keep them safe from the rain this is a long shot bt
You 1000% can buy glitter grout. It exists in the real world. Mia Maples has used it many times. It is a subtle glitter but it is glittery none thr less.
1:39 none of your siblings have kids?
Ok but why are all the cursed projects ending in beautiful results 😭
I feel like the black sheep’s wool was dyed black. I’ve dealt with wool from black sheep or alpaca and it was a dark brown up close. Joob’s hair looked like a natural black to me.
me: imagining the ultimate nug, i.e a McDonald's nugget, which is smooth and already preserved to last a lifetime Evan and Katelyn: some random chunky chicken blob
Every turn was a left and I am here for it
I thought they would have went straight to flocking the actual teeth
this was cool, but dang it, that a waste of some delish looking nugs /: you made me want some now & no, i cant go get, none in freezer & all shops are shut due to it being 04:12 AM as i write this x
Aaaaa I can’t watch this as I just took my sleep medssss
the boards flat side looks oddly jpegish to me lol.
Lol you can tell that Evan and Katelyn are very in sync with each other... At 18:20 there were no questions, no confusion, just acceptance. Evan didn't even flinch! Lol 🤣
this may never be seen or done but for some reason I'd like to see you make a resin bowling ball.
BEAN TOILET SEAT <3 MUCH much much love btw
there is a japanese book where they show you how to make different crafts from cat fur
yahoo is still a thing?   lolz
can you brake a mirror by driving over it thats coated in resin?
Whaddya mean there's not glitter grout? I've 100% seen such a product on the market
Would you care to open up the cheeks?
I want to see you do the irl resin time dance, not the montage! Haha
I was eating chicken nuggets when you guys were making the chicken nugget earrings lol
Resin, mood ring, galaxy statement ring. Send to patrons?
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
missed opportunity for dino nuggets 😢
Y'all make me laugh!    Make a resin statement galaxy ring? 💍 🌃
22:26 Katelyn, glitter grout is actually a thing already! :) I’d be interested to see what weird/cool things you guys could do with it.
Only god knows if mold release was used
So I know that these were all “bad” ideas but for your consideration, Dino nuggies
I remember I saw someone on tiktok turn their cat's fur into yarn and make a pot holder w/ it; Joob yarn when? Also, I saw bean chair. Bean chair, bean chair, bean chair, BEAN CHAIR
love your videos. I know it was a joke but please make the chair made from beans. In resin. Thank you and stay safe.
You can totally add glitter to grout.  I have it in my bathrooms and it looks great.  Glitter in the paint in my craft room too.
And also I love your vids keep up the good work❤ but… I wish I could talk to you guys on zoom or in person I’m a large fan(pls don’t send me your home address I would feel like a bad person). This word is for Evan “ CHOAS!” And Katelyn this is a secret 🤐 sometimes do you just want to punch something and yell?
I can tell by looking at the smaller, darker nuggets are from Chick-Fil-A just from how many times I’ve eaten from there- 😃 (ps i would totally wear them) and i think the other nuggets are from McDonald’s which I’ve also eaten a lot of lol
My arms itch at the sight of the cat fur in the bag!!!! Ahhh!!!
Was the resin food safe?
22:45 I started watching this after I ate a gummy and now they look like scientists performing nuclear fission
Surprised you didn’t test Dino nuggets.
The first video I watched of them was the velvet nails, and the the rest was history. What was the first video you watched?
You should try Nuggs, they’re the best nuggets out there right now. They’re vegan but trust me, amazing…
I still think you need to make some kind of armor, 3d printed or otherwise, for Joob.
Evan I am kind of like you in personality I feel like 😂😂😂
Peter Brown has entered the chat.
Charcuterie bean?????
mood ring phone cases  Not cursed, just cool
You're not grouting with hot glue, you're caulking.  Yes, hot glue (thermoplastics) can be used to caulk.
Oh my friends you are in for a treat there's a whole book by Kaori Tsutaya - "Crafting with Cat Hair".
Joob: U my child The cat toy: ……………… Joob: I wuvs u 2. And u smells like hams E and K: U like the FLOOF made of ur FLOOF?
Use velvet, wood, and resin to make a box for a dice-game or something like that… could even add brass/aluminum accents
Also, they actually do make a glitter additive for grout! I watched Mia Maples glitter grout more rooms in her house than you'd think.
I dunno if it's a good idea to actually let Joob play with those cat hair "toys".  Cats will eat their own hair by instinct, and cats don't typically have any problem destroying felt (a lot of commercial toys use felt accents) and I'd be worried she'd eat the toys and give herself especially bad hairballs.
There is a lady on Etsy who sells hand made cat and dog toy items made from your pets fur.   There is also a mill company that will accept whatever fur you want to spin (horse hair, cow, ox, cat or dog) and theybwill turn it into yarn which you can then crochet or knit with. They also raise money for animal charities by selling yarn that is made from the left over scraps of other orders. The things ya know 🌈
Yahoo mail? Did I just downgrade to dial up 🤔
Video idea: I noticed Joob is always on the floor in your videos. Maybe it's time to build her a cat highway/ catify your house to get her off the floor. :)
The bean board looks like minecraft lava its great though
LOL. What about covering the flocked toilet seat in resin and the flocked toothbrush in resin and putting 'em in the guest bathroom just to prank people?
My first email address was yahoo and it's wild to me to hear a youtuber say yahoo and ask me to download the damn yahoo mail app that I refuse to download out of sheer stubbornness at this point ( I have gotten so many notifications that I'm not using the app and at this point I never will lol) like the last time I heard someone talk about yahoo was when they bought tumblr
I want the cutting board
Joob's favorite craft you've made for her being a literal extension of her own body is just the biggest mood😂
D-I- Why
Cool, cool. When does the video of the bad ideas come out?
You guys should make a bean purse 😂 hoping you guys recover well from Covid!
“We would never do this, we don’t have access to a baby” 1:39
Is epoxy safe to eat off of?
you need to do another podcast
That one comment that says, "You should flock Evan" 😂
is it weird I assumed they were doing velvet teeth from the thumbnail? I would love velvet on that plastic teeth model 😂😂
How did you have to order glitter??
Love you guys, can you do a Photo Transfer on Resin like you can on glass or ceramics?
Ok but was yall usin the velvet and moodring toilet seats
You two should coat those fake teeth in velvet.
I rewatched the joob car video recently and I'm still interested in what Evan said at the beginning about building something enclosed you could take her on walks with
Out of all the toys and devices you've made for the supurvisor, the one she's most into is made from scavenged fragments of her own being
2 things about the grout. 1: You CAN have glitter in normal grout. 2: for using hot glue a heat gun is your friend. It keeps the glue pliable and makes clean up easier.  Also, the Joob hair cat toy was amazing.
i feel like you kinda have to cover those teeth in velvet now tbh
Wow i feel like we just got a bunch of videos in one well done :)
Yahoo still exists?
what is your design aesthetic?  Evan and Katelyn: B E A N S
Love the mini Joob! Glitter grout is actually a thing btw
Following the beans, I'd love spaghetti or spaghetti O's cutting board. Or plates. Or bowls. SILVERWARE.
Ok, but now we need to spin Joob's fur into yarn and crochet/knit something with it. Like socks.
Resin press on nails?👀  RESIN SCISSORS?!?!?!  Idk why my brain jumped from nails to scissors but oh well
I swear, yall providing 5 minute crafts with so much content ideas with this video x,,,D
Hot glue creations?? Like....hm..like you know how Katelyn made a snow man during the gingerbread video?? Like what if u go layer by layer making one big thing?? ONE BIG JOOB!!! wait thatd take forever omg nvm🤣🤣🤣
😍
What happened to the ✨Fancy✨Pringles Earrings
I'm pretty sure you actually could put glitter in regular grout...
OH!! maybe make a small kitten baby for the supurrvisor?? Idk out of what tho but its cute!
Omg imagine feeling the little fuzzies in your mouth from brushing with it EEWWWWWW
Your best bet with the hot glue grout would be to just fill it and scrape it off even with the top of the tile with like a window scraper or something. I've seen it done with concrete floors in the expansion joints but with epoxy.
That hairball is so far beyond cursed omfg
Is Evan ill? Your voice sounds scratchy! 🤧🤒
Your videos are the best they always make me laugh
Can you try using resin to grout?!!!! Please????
I love how Evan thought the toothbrush felt weird and not luxurious, yet thought the TOILET SEAT was luxurious. Send this man help
Brb. Buying a felting starter kit on etsy to create my cat a mini army to rule over.
I do have to say you two have made me want to pursue art more in college and so now guess who is going to be an art major? Meeee 😄I went to tour a college today and they had a glowforge and it made me think of yall 😆
You should try to make some resin claw clip for hair
Today like all days, they let the intrusive thoughts win
Is it just me, or was the intro like Dr. Heinz Doofinshmirts and his self destruct buttons?
Okay, hear me out. Instead of "a little resin residue" you could say "a little resindue" 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
You can definitely buy glitter grout 😁 I love the concept
I am so disappointed that Evan didn’t get his ears pierced for this one!
Glitter Grout...does exist tho 😆😆😆😆
Euw imagine the mouldy nuggets in the resin😭
Think Joob was being maternal towards the toy 🙂
They actually do make glitter grout that’s an epoxy. First time I used it was on a custom home build and the customer wanted it in their powder room tile. Nasty to work with compared to normal grout but it does sparkle.
Video ideas : (for those who can’t pause fast enough) Easy DIY coasters (don’t try at home) Who does our cat love more Cat boots DIY teeth Cactus for humans Trying fried food for the first time  Chair made of beans Resin hair Husband and wife toilet challenge Catio for humans World’s largest laptop  Worlds smallest laptop  Resin taste test Gelatin toilet seat (so comfortable) Automatic ham dispenser  Resin house (5 year build) Cloning ourselves (shocking results) DIY indoor pool filled with cereal  1000 lb dice
I love that Katelyn's reason for not casting a baby in resin is that they don't have access to one. I legitimately love that!
I love how the baby idea is thrown out because you "don't have access to a baby" not, you know, for other reasons, hahahahahaha!
I wonder if you can cook beans in a toaster using a tin foil pouch. Anyway, great video!
Lol, yahoo? Really? They make it impossible to recover an account if you've changed your number, I recommend no one use it as a main email if they need any sort of long term reliability.
We have two week old foster puppies and they are the cutest little nuggets. We also foster cats (over 300). From just born to the age that the animal can be spayed or neutered. Im also a mechanical engineering sophomore so if Evan has any tips on getting an engineering degree it’d be cool to hear some. Or if he could share like things that he did that help in college or something that happened while he was working for an engineering company that he didn’t expect to
Velvet Teeth Velvet Teeth
Velvet Teeth Velvet Teeth Velvet Teeth Velvet Teeth
Kind of sad you didn’t use dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets
Glitter grout is a thing already
I can't be the only one that now absolutely needs a human sized Catcus    Right....?
I'm eating bean soup while watching Evan and Katelyn make a bean cutting board. Also there's a whole crafting book out there of making things with cat fur, I think it includes needle felting?
JOOB my precious baby boi
Wow, does Yahoo as till exist? I used to use Yahoo (and altavista) as a search engine, Yes I'm that old. Nice to see the are still around.  And nice vid ofcourse 😁.
joob's reaction to the cat hair toy might be her mother instinct kicking in since it has her smell, in other words you just made a baby kitty for joobs with her hair. Have you thought about getting for joobs a friend?
Or maybe a resin floor board for your car? Or a cheap scrap car that barely runs "a project car?" For resin call it the resin mobile?
the resin you used for the chiken nugget be looking sus tho
Can y'all make a resin rain coat? 😆
11:49 it looks like a cat hair potato
#1- HOW DARE YOU NOT USE DINO NUGGIES! #2- if you use soap and warm water it helps the felting process while preventing stray hairs
Should've made a small coaster out shot glass from the resiny beans you pulled out XD
please do velvet tttttttteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetttttthhhhhhhhhh
Minecraft Lava Bean Cutting Board!~!
Katelyn and i made the same face at resin baby.....🧐
Joob is a very particular cat. I have a sneaking suspicion if you graphed E&K’s time to complete a project for her versus enjoyment it would be a steep inverse curve. Supervisor purrfers more time for pets I suspect 😂
I wad okay with how much i enjoyed the mini joob made of joob, BUT i actually hate how much i loved the bean board 🤣🤣 its so cursed but soooo good 🤣
There is glitter grout.  You guys should buy some and try it!  If you want to see someone try it, you can watch Mia Maples.
But for real, ✨glitter grout✨! I’m curious what your take on it is. Is it worth the bucks or stick to the oooh gee grout?
Are we sure that's not a bean paddle?
Nor sure which TotalBoat resin you used for the bean cutting board, but I'd be wary about have any food come into contact with it.  Some hardeners contain amines, which are bio-accumulative  and carcinogenic, like bisphenol A (BPA). Also, adding *any* additives, like colorants, glitter, beans, render even cured epoxy no longer food safe because of potential chemical compounds created by using the additive. So the FDA can only guarantee that certain epoxy resins are food safe, if measured correctly, cured correctly, and have no additives mixed into the resin. Just a PSA for you two lovelies! You always teach us about resin safety.
Hey, I’ve never thought about it, but…is that total boat resin food safe? I know it’s just plastic, essentially. And I’ve seen those epoxy river cutting boards before. Probably best to only use it as a serving tray.
Are you *sure* you can't put glitter in grout? 🤔
Ctrl + Z ...
You can eat things from resin? Like from the cutting board?
Absolutely love 2:21 in. This is my life all the time.
So...did you just make essentially a voodoo doll of your cat?
best use of jazz so far in 2023
I wish I could hate the beans cutting board...I'm confused and uncomfortable but still, I cannot look away.
did anyone else expect them to put velvet flocking on the teeth? just me?
"... we're not crazy people."  Sure, we believe you
food safe resin??
Glitter grouts a thing trust me i've seen to many DIYs of glitter grout
Me when I realise that the circular chicken nuggets were the Mc Donalds ones: you wanna give me one or five 😏😏😏
Mood ring phone case (yes you can add glitter galaxy if you like)
There is glitter you can add to grout. Lol
I think if the velvet was only on the handle of the toothbrush it would have gone better 🤣
Sponsored by Yahoo! Mail app? They are trying to make a come back I guess?
Those are some pretty sick tees, my guys! Still can't believe how well those turned out.
Who called Evan?
most successful creation for Jube
I just had to frantically turn down the cheek spreading content because my husband was giving me funny looks. Weirdly, saying "it's only evan and katelyn" didn't make the look any less funny. 😅😅
Now you have to flock the teeth
Can you guys please do a matching bean plate/bowl/glass set 😭 it would be so classy
What about hot shower water on the grout?
You should try to make a cat-human, human-cat translator
Glitter grout is a thing, you should use it in a video.
You could put glitter in grout, but it would just look like normal grout.
I hope Hank Green finds this bean cutting board
Combo of two of the ideas.... flocked grout?
I was almost done eating when I started this video and the chicken nugget jewelry rly made my stomach go “we could 100% go for some nugs rn” 😂
“we would never do that we don’t have access to a baby”
Resin taste test? ahmm......how about...... NO ! ! ! :D
They make glitter grout. They also make dyed grout.
i wish they velvet the teeth for ultra cursed
You can use silicone instead of grout. Pretty sure that’s a normal thing to do
Well you did at least answer your video idea of "Who does Joob's love more" by making the needle felt cat out of cat fur. The answer is herself. She loves herself more.
I think this should be a monthly recurrence! These were great choices!
Someone definitely don't tell Katelyn about glitter grout ✨✨✨✨
the smooth bean cutting board side looks like minecraft lava.
Now you just need to eat the chicken nugget earrings. It could be a whole new delicious resin sauce
17:32 What the flock is this?
Loved the video esp Joobay's reaction to the cat toy
🤣 yahoo mail
This video was a mixture of blursed with "bad taste, great execution" 🤣🤣🤣
God the Bean cutting board is absolutely magnificent!
Ugh. Now I have to save the hair of my chihuahua to make an even tinier version of him 😭❤️
Get ready for the door knock from PETA.
I feel like it’s time to tell you that there is in fact glitter grout and that was a big trend not too long ago
When you said "chicken nugget earrings" I thought you were going to find/make a silicon mould for the resin but this is better XD Like Katelyn said, glorious!
Seeing the resin cutting board mold, gave me so many ideas, you could do some really cool looking boards. I keep wanting to start doing stuff with resin but haven't yet. Of course you don't want to actually use a resin cutting board with your good knives, but ok for serving or just for looks
I think a cool thing you could add in post to the nugget jewelry is if you made a colored resin to look like sauce and just dip the bottoms of the jewelry into it so they’re ✨saucy nuggies✨ 9:03
17:36 Guys I'm literally in a hospital waiting room rn and i giggled out loud at this perfectly cursed beauty shot. This is legit ✨art✨
So.... Glitter grout vid soon?
You guys are the best. I always love watching your videos. You're funny, smart and entertaining.
My sister has been wearing chicken nugget earrings for years! She bought plastic toy nuggets and turned them into earrings so that she could express her weird self! She did the same with pizza and hotdogs. Such a trend setter haha! I hope she sees this; she love you guys ! Miss you weirdo.
Ringe
Make a chicken nugget rite and baby resane
There is a whole book of uh. Cat hair felting crafts. Just FYI...
So I think for future projects where you guys encase something organic in resin like a chicken nugget or this year's pumpkin project, you should dehydrate or freeze dry the item before you cover it in resin, so that the only moisture would be from the item sucking up the resin into it, making it way less likely to rot and mold over from the moisture left inside!
Make a Joob out of Joob
you guys are so fun to watch i have see all your videos and i inspire to make stuff like you guys you always make me smile and laugh in every video and i hope you have a great day :)
My first thought about the "Cat Toy" was why are they making a Joob Voo Doo doll??
I feel like the cutting board should’ve been displayed with sausage or weenies because that’s what you eat with beans😂
was curious have you never heard of glitter grout?
"Would you care to open up the cheeks?"... Aight, what you trying to pull here Katelyn? 😂
Joob looks as if she thinks tiny Joob is a kitten lol
That gurgle sound in the beginning really made me think it was coming from my stomach... I was concerned.
I would 100% buy a bean board. Where is Rhett from GMM… he needs this…
Customize your luggage with resin for more durability and visibility!
I started typing a comment about masking tape when you started the glue grout but you figured it out!
they literaly made a vodoo doll of joob and no one is saying anything
Resin gloves, resin gloves, du du du du resin gloves, yeah.  (Can't believe my resin gloves idea actually got a mention lmao)
Do more cursed diy idea videos
Hate cats!
I hate to break it to you Katelyn, but glitter grout is a thing.
Yahoo? Security, who needs it
Yahoo mail app lol
Whenever someone asks me about couple goals, I will show them Evan and Katelyn. They are adorable :'3❤️
Am I the only one to think we were gonna have velvet gums at the end..? I guess more cursed ideas
The intro 😭
the projects were cursed but we were blessed with a 30-minute e&k video 🫡🫡
Baked bean spanker - pleasing all the kinks
Fun fact! No cats are black!!! They're an incredibly dark grey or brown.  Even Bombay cats, known to be the blackest house cats, aren't black!  Even panthers are a deep grey.  Cool huh?
Still waiting on the resin vibrator episode.  Or did you secretly made one already?😆
I love that the problem in the resin baby idea is "We don't have access to a baby" and not "we shouldn't dip a baby in resin"
I have a black tabby cat and none of his hairs are black once they are shed. They look light grey/almost white which is so strange because as a whole, he looks to be a black cat.
Black-furred animals are technically just really, really dark brown. Nature can't really make true black fur. It's why, for example, some black animals fade to brown in the sun.
My 16yr old for baby went over the rainbow bridge 🌈 in November, however before she passed, I used to roll her excess fur from brushing into a ball as toys for her. If add to existing balls and the largest was nearly tennis ball sized. I just rolled the ball in my hands and added the new "puck" of new hair from the cat brush. They ended up super smooth and were very dense. They were Jazzy's favourite toys and totally free!
Make a ARMY OF BABY JOOBS AND PUT THEM IN A SMALL FISH BED FOR THE SMALLEST CAT ARMY
Make a ARMY OF BABY JOOBS AND PUT THEM IN A SMALL FISH BED FOR THE SMALLEST CAT ARMY
I love how they don't even try to deny that they're that type of channel anymore 😂😂
the joob toy might be tricking job xD  i think the real cat fur probobly made her think it was a real kitten and the familiar scent might have just made her think " ah yes familty i shall adopt it "  and then she figured out it did nothing and just slapped it LMAO
I want to eat the chicken nugget
:)
Look up glitter grouting, people definitely do that and it's gorgeous 😍 ✨️
Shart-cutery board
You should make a bean toilet seat
I would love to see a gelatin toilet seat
The do make glitter grout. the bathroom in my old house had black and white tiles with silver glitter grout. it created an optical illusion. it made the tiles look blurry was a cool effect.
You don't have access to a baby...yet...
Two young adults so brought to their knees by societ that their fantasy on making projects is empty and thus making the most ridiculous things for views, only americans!. Hope russia throws a few in there to be honest.
you should try gluing beans to a canvas and then follow a Bob Ross tutorial and paint them
I had some friends growing up who needle felted and their mom also spun her own yarn, and they had cats so of course the logical next step was they needle felted with cat hair and spun yarn out of cat hair. Super interesting to watch
0:07 I wasnt really paying attention and I some how thought one of the ideas was a resin husband 😆
the bean cutting board is so bootiful. 👁️👄👁️
Glitter grout exists!
I want to see the look on their Parents face when they are having a fancy brunch and Katelyn sais "Get out the fancy cutlery" and Evan just whips out a bean cutting board.
They do make glitter grout I'm pretty sure
This is all cursed.  I enjoyed it
Please make the fake teeth out of velvet!
Wait for a couple of weeks when it starts to smell
So when I worked in a bookstore, there was a book called “crafting with cat hair” that was all about ways to needlefelt with cat hair. It is absolutely a thing that some people do, enough that there is a whole book on how to do it!
I love that they're just being themselves having fun together
WAIT hold on ONE minute, you're not going to cast a baby in resin "because you don't have access to a baby" So it's not off the table *IF* you had access to a baby????? 😕🚼 Edit: LOL at the * disclaimer warning *
You should make a necklace with ham in it for Joobie 😹
Missed opportunity not having the bottom half of the nuggs a different colour of resin to make it look like they're dipped in sauce. :(
Katelyn knew he put too many beans and decided it wasn’t worth arguing and smooshed them down with him
Glitter grout is a thing it’s and epoxy based
Resin outfit! 👠  Or a doll house made of resin!
Velvet dentures 👁👄👁
10:05 it’s like cotton candy
I was watching this and my friend wanted to see what I was watching and when he saw the chicken nuggets he gave me a look of cursedness if that’s even a word
how about resin tiles
I love how the ideas in the deleted document start relatively tame (coasters! who does Joob prefer? cat boots!), take a cursed turn (making teeth...? eating wood??) and then spiral into proper youtuber madness (gelatin toilet seat!!! eating resin!!?!)
Let's be honest. There's no way anyone could have foreseen Jube pushing a button sitting next to a keyboard.
Flock the teeth 😈
I feel like dehydrating the nuggets before resin would make them actually practical as jewelry.  I think I’ve seen a person on Etsy that makes jewelry with Dino nuggies
"I dont think this is weird at all" bahahaha
I like how only one candle was lit. 😂😂😂 Also, I would love to see you guys do actual glitter grouting!
Man this was kinda cursed.
You failed the blue tape.  Blue tape fails no one!
I love your videos so much they make my day better!
These were so cool, and can't wait for your next vid.
It must be said: roooollll that beautiful bean footage!
PLEASE ignore all wood burning ideas!!! It's insanely dangerous! Watch Ann Reardon's video on the subject.
Wait til they find out glitter grout exists XD
I know dino nuggets would have been hard to do on the rotisserie, but I was still hoping for dino nuggets lol
make a cat house with a bathroom, playroom and a kitchen.. XD i'm laughing so hard rn. a heat reactive furniture. Just have like a room in your house thats just heat reactive furniture. get a hamster and build a real mini house for it. make a GIANT cat statue of Joooooooobie. make deserts out of resin build a mini version of your house and make mini you guys and put it in the background. bathroom makeover DIY makeup and make the packaging out of resin and then sell it-or just give it away. make a video game make a cat throne out of resin and wood make a cat obsticle course..  I literlly cant write english bc i dislexic and icelandic but here are some grate ideas.....🙂
No more resin sponsor?? 😮😮
Evan: and if those purchases are in transit… Katelyn: **hurls box** 😂😂😂😂😂
Is it just me or does the nugget jewellery sort of look like crystals?
cat likes voodoo doll was the moment that made my long and tough day better
Resin Galaxy Joob- resin baby
But glitter grout is a thing?
Evan and Katelyn: Coat a pumpkin in resin Also Evan and Katelyn: Forget the pumpkin in resin still rotted Also also Evan and Katelyn: Coat chimken numgets in resin What could go wrong?
"This one document with no backups" .... suuuurrrreeeee  lol
so my family has a tradition of giving weird gifts, and my grandpa is a dentist..... this years gift will really make them say "What the flock!!"   ok ill leave for that pun....
Hi I love your videos and I’m a big fan but I would like y’all to do mare woodworking or stuff for Jobbie cuz those are my fave kind of videos
Do you guys still use your cat car?
For y’all’s love of silicone, resin, and blue tape. Have y’all heard of the use of all three as mods to make a keyboard sound better?
Ah I mistakenly thought they were going to flock the teeth... Oh well...
The little joob smells like an actual cat that’s why she’s grooming it
I am not a vegan by any stretch of the imagination and my father was a butcher. Seeing you handle animal products with that kind of disregard is saddening. Yes, humans are predators, but do we need to be cruel and quite frankly S holes? This is a bad video.
Why does the bean cutting board kinda look like Minecraft lava tho 😂😂😂
lil Joobs her kid :'D
bean plates???
In order for food products to not go spoiled after its been in case in resin, would it be helpful to put the food in a vacuum chamber in the process of submerging it in resin to remove as much oxygen as possible from the food as it goes in the resin?
There is literally a book about crafting with cat fur. A friend gave it to me a few years ago as a joke since I have a very fluffy ginger girl that makes Tribbles when I comb her.
OMG you should’ve done DINO CHICKEN NUGGETS 😂
This should be a series! Its so fun to watch!!
Using pet hair in needle felting is actually a real thing! It’s a memorial type thing for pets who have crossed the rainbow bridge
my aunt got a scarf made out of her cats hair
ARE THE CHICKEN NUGGETS FROM CHICK FIL A!!!?!!  I know the look of those nuggets
I would buy that cutting board for at the very least 70 bucks
i love that the only reason they couldn’t make a resin baby is because they don’t have access to one lmao😂
the nuggets looked like glazed dounut holes
personally, I'm interested in the Gelatin Toilet Seat (its so comfortable). could be useful
pleonasmsk rdon!  i meant to say 1:39 PARDON!  but my phone glitched…
23:39 beans
pleonasmsk rdon!
Cutting boards are supposed to have a textured bottom. If its flat water can get trapped and it gets funky.   So you done good.
Dang I used to get notifications for anything a YouTuber I subscribed to even the social posts but no not anymore 🥲 I had so many good ideas
I thought resin wasn't food safe?
Excuse me. The Yahoo what???
You CAN indeed add glitter to your grout. 😋 I’ve seen it done on Mia Maples channel. You have to add a lot of glitter, but it totally works!
Ahhh I've been so ready for this notification!!!
I find it so funny how nobody is mentioning that you stuck your finger in Evans mouth and he did nothing 😂😂 your content is amazing.
Ok I have a cursed idea name the chicken nugget jewelry chicken names.
I love the little needle-felted kitty and how absolutely confused Joob was that it smelled like her. 🤣
The mini- joobie was sooo cute! But poor joobie - she looked like she thought she got a real kitten as a present 😅
Glitter grout is a thing! I saw someone use it in a bathroom makeover😅
The mini Joobie is just too adorable, I totally get why big Joobs dig it! The velvet toothbrush is so wrong on so many levels - non-stop spine chills..
It's unsettling that the only thing preventing you guys from casting a baby in resin is that you don't have access to a baby.
Is that resin safe for food contact? I've been a little wary when i saw them use it in contact with food! (but overall, the outcome is great)
Was the hot glue grout durable though?
The grouting with hot glue actually seems like a good idea for making models and mockups, since they're a lot smaller.
Is that LibreOffice I see? 00:30
Full chainmail shirt with resin rings.
this video reminded me much too entirely of jenna marbles content. Not a bad thing at all, the icon she was, it was nice. I wish you guys would maybe make more woodworking videos? Only if you want to and actually have something to build but i just loved those types of videos too.
6:55  I'm so sad and upset totally miss the opportunity to Do dinosaur nuggets
I've seen someone add glitter to their grout and it came out nice!
Evan brought in the teeth and I was disappointed that you weren't making velvet teeth...
oh my the cutting board looks beani-ful much proud
Velvet the teeth next time!
For real grout that's like a 0/10 but for diorama or something? 👀👀👀👀 i bet white hot glue is cheaper than grout and if you do small areas it's ok that it's fast, 10/10 i will keep that in mind for the future
Now that you have the teeth…. Please make a resin grill 😂😅
Spooky!  I started needle felting for the first time this week and was actually felting while watching this video!
DIY velvet glasses?!!!!!!! For beverages and eyes!!!!!
So for the needle felting with cat fur, I have actually done that. You can't do it with all cat fur exactly, not the way you are doing it, but I had a orange tabby that passed away and to get over the grief of losing her, I actually took a lot of the cat fluff she left behind and made a little effigy of her in remembrance using needle felting. There are businesses who do similar things for others who have lose beloved pets as well so it is not outside of something that can be done. Now with how well that can be holding up as a cat toy...... I sort of doubt it will hold up much at all.
You could probably put glitter in regular grout and do things with it. Or like sprinkle it on and blow excess away after grouting?
Do needle felting 😃
resin glasses??
As to Joob black vs dyed wool black- this is the result of modern dye processes. Before very very recently true dark black as a fiber dye was difficult and expensive, and often faded. The best for mostly-reliable black was wool from black animals like sheep or goats, which took much longer to get around to fading.  So worry not- Joob is a real black cat. Just actual nature-black instead of modern-dye black.
Watching this while eating lunch lol the cat hair was ummmmmm ....love you guys
Some future ideas, all with the ~but fancy~ implied (or things that I would do if I had enough room, time, and money): Resin bones/skeleton (bonus points for anatomical accuracy) Resin teeth Resin fruit and vegetables, but even fancier. I want glittery bananas, I want gold mica powder potatoes. 3D resin flowers - is this a thing? I don't know! But I want to do/see it! Resin charcuterie spread Make a full necklace/bracelet out of glass beads Make charms for said necklace/bracelet (time to get into smithing?) Ages ago you made a resin/wood PC case, I'd be interested in seeing that again but different! Maybe full resin, or full wood to go with the Scrabble keyboard? Something with pressed or dried flowers in resin! I love how it looks so much, I have a collection of various things that are flowers in resin/glass. I've always loved pressed flowers and I'm so glad they're having a moment right now so I can stock up and watch that good good forever flower content 👀  Anyway I don't expect you to read this but I hope you do! I think any of these would be really fun and I personally would obviously enjoy watching them. And then buying the finished project off you...? It's not my fault I live in a tiny house in the middle of nowhere!
If you wanna use something but are afraid about it being on top, do a clear coat after it hardens? protective clear layer, but still has the look. If you want the texture of the item it's different, but with this, you can do a decent layer on top of clear so it's a function cutting board that looks like beans
Little did they know, they make glitter and colorants for grout now....
"Open up the cheeks." - Katelyn
Made sure to have wet cheeks, but not toothpaste??
Beancuterie board!!! Honestly the best resin project ever. Y’all are amazing.
Please be careful about eating off resin unless it's food safe n_n
So i guess i wont see evan walk in "glass" resin cinderella slippers 😢
In the kitchen area at my office they have bronze glitter grout 🎉 looks fabulous with the bronzey tiles❤
Not the unbranded resin!
Omg, VELVET TEETH! Please?
When I saw someone suggesting wood burning I inhaled so hard, I hope you guys do not ever attempt wood burning because it is SO dangerous and I'd rather you guys be 100% safe. Other than that... I love that Joob was the one who made you run out of ideas... totally her fault LOL Also so many of these were just... totally your energy and vibe LMAO
You should look into flexible resin 3d printing
Have y’all ever thought of making silicone keycaps? With or without art on them?
For me what's far more impressive than y'all's creativity is your impeccable problem-solving skills.
Thaaanks I need more videos of you guys😇
I’ve never hated anything more than seeing nuggets dangling off a human being. I love this channel
I see maggots instead of beans 😬
I love that their idea of luxury means GLITTER
Ok, Catio for humans got me
I understood the blue tape on the mouse to cover up the logo right away, but for whatever reason I was at first puzzled by the "Evan & Katelyn" label on the monitor. Like, why would you label your monitor? Who is confused about who's monitor that is? Thankfully I then noticed the blue tape on the mouse and everything was again right with the world. Grade A "Delete All Ideas" button BTW.
I believe there is actually glittery grout. It may be cool to find different types and brands and test them out 😊
I have an idea, resin ceiling fan blades with UV or glow in the dark paint
Joob treating little joob like a baby is so cute
Fun fact: glitter grout is a thing! From what I've seen it can be a pain to work with but it definitely makes a statement.
there is, in fact, glitter grout.
the bean cutting board was the best idea ever
Lol, you guys can use the tip of the glue gun to level out the hot glue 😂😂😅
Fantastic ideas 😂😂
Totalboat!! Where is totalboat!!
Fancy nuggies
They do make glitter grout... It's in my bathroom.
So sad they didn’t use shaped nuggets! Dino nugget earrings!? Yes!
I think she thinks it's a kitten. Lol SHE WANTS A KITTEN! AND SO DO YOU GUYS!
Glitter Grout is a thing. You do not need hot glue
Joob: “is impurrsinator”
They should make dinosaur chicken nugget jewelry next
I’ll later need an update on whether or not those earrings/necklaces mold
It was almost shocking to see just one email in the inbox. My Yahoo email addresses acquire new spam emails by the minute.
FYI, there is a glitter additive for grout.
Glitter grout is an actual thing, which would be neat to see alongside the glitter hot glue grout
You could re-approach bent resin
It's a Joobu Doll!
Here's a prediction for what will happen in a few years. After the TV crew interviewed their neighbor who says "but I don't understand, they were totally normal people, I never expected them to do this", the camera cuts to the anchor: "in fact, there may have been signs that this couple had disturbing habits", followed by the sequence at 18:36.
Katelyn putting her finger in Evans mouth and Evan just letting her 😂 my husband and I are the same way lmao marriage in a nutshell
I actually didn't know yahoo mail was still operating
ok that bean board is legit cool. if you two find yourselves throwing some sort of party you should totally use it for the cheese board, especially considering how much those beans cost
I think joob likes that cat toy more than anything else you've made 😂
So this just reminds me that it's been a long time since you've had any videos crossing over with William Osman 😅
"some days you wake up and just wanna flock a toothbrush" sounds familiar..
You always see jokes about cats shedding enough to make another cat, but you never see it realized. Until now.
That's not a cutting board, that's a yaoi paddle 🤨🧐
Did anyone else sing "Beans! Beans! Beans! Beans!" along to Canon in D?  Just me then...
There is grout with glitter in it i think, i saw it on tiktok. It looked really cool!
you should make more Joobie accesories
Wait, not all people use the yahoo mail app? They have to do adds on it? My first email was a yahoo email address and never changed it since😂
So, you guys were worried to inhale fumes of toilet paper burning, but were ok putting salame on your eyes? Hahaha 🤯
The glitter grout idea is actually a thing it's big on TikTok, but also Mia maples has done so several times in her bathrooms.
I make little hats out of cat hait for my cats, but sadly, one of them will eat it if I let her so I can't leave them with the hat
@Evan and katelyn did you do work whilst having covid, even if not filmed? If so, were the masks a pain?
"We don't have access to a baby" 😂😂😂
I can confirm that cat hair works in needle felting, in the hospital after surgery the lady on the other side of the curtain was doing it for like 8 hours The only reason ik it was cat hair is cause we heard her tell the nurse
Love this!!!! Hope y'all keep doing this. Reminds me of Jenna Marbles, just doing random stuff people wanted her to try :)
Please someone show Evan And Katelyn glitter grout   it exists!!! Lmao
From the thumbnail I thought they were gonna make the teeth velvet and ngl was kinda disappointed
13:05 oh my gosh! It's a baby joob!
Now put velvet on the fake teeth!!
When you legit just got into the bath but you had to watch  👁👄👁
The cat hair toy was extremely unsettling to me, but I think it might be the most successful thing they've ever made for Joob.
so cring e youre still obsessed about that cat..ugh. it totally ruined your channel
How about a DIY cat condo or some cat wall furniture
Finally, something to match the potato chip earrings
I love the vid but You got sponsored by the *Yahoo Mail App*
what.... there was a second channel this entire time???!
You have dentures/fake teeth. Now, make velvet dentures! :D
Joob has a baby joob 🥺
Katelyn looks very fashionable in the chicken nugget jewelry!
actually, glitter grout IS a thing
This should be a series! 😂
Back when I did my bathroom Latticrete had a glitter additive for the grout I used. They also offered a glow in the dark add-in.
Velvet light shade...maybe it'll make the room red? Could be cool? Or an entire keyboard all key caps made with resin and make a design or something out of the key caps
yahoo mail, my god 😂
As a dental hygienist, I wanted y’all to flock the teeth themselves 😂
Have you seriously never heard of glitter grout it’s amazing 😂 lol 23:26
Fingers crossed they researched food safe resin pre-beaning
you didn't ask for more ideas, but i think it'd be cool to do like... impressionism paintings in resin! (like van gogh and monet)
The beans cutting board makes my trypophobia go wild..🫡🫡🫡
plz starseeds, you have higher purpose than this....
Bean chair! Bean chair!
You guys should have made the teeth (only the teeth, not the gums) covered in fuzzy power too, just to make it even more cursed
Ok now we really need a human catio.
The skit made me think it was an ad for a second
As a french person, I feel offended by this charcutery board. Great video tho!
I love that the reason you didn't cast a baby and resin was because you just didn't have access to a baby. Lol
Cleep with the velvet toothbrush.
Evan's logistical concerns about the velvet toothbrush are so valid and I had a lot of the same concerns 🤔 very well said
Better watch out. Next thing you know those craft channels stole your diy ideas
7:50 that's what I look like trying to get up in the morning
I thought you guys said resin isn't food safe? I'm not sure the cutting board was a good idea.
Did y’all treat the cutting board before putting food on it?
Katelyn casually testing the wetness of the fake "cheeks" compared to real cheeks. You know Evan is used to these sort of random tests because he just calmly let it happen🤣 THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF CHANNEL GUYS 🤣🤣 Such a fun video! Got a some laughs in for sure! I'll also add, as a crazy fellow cat person of 2 floofs, Joob's hairy friend was my favorite🥰
*bright wide smile* ok guys well you guys' ideas truly have been cursed! 😭
Did Yahoo want No other advertiser in the Video or did totalboat drop you? :'-(
The lack of dino nuggies is an atrocity 😂
Imagine being an animal, dying, only so that some people can cover you in resin. I think it's distastful and I don't like it.
Re: Hot-Glue Grouting: You can make hot glue malleable again with a heat gun. I have a tiny gas-powered torch that would work wonders. Before the stuff starts burning, there is a temperature range within the hot glue flows pretty well and self-levels decently enough for grout. And once it's that hot, it stays hot for ages, ample time to straigthen it out 😉 But yeah, grout is probably still cheaper 😂 And you can definitely get glittery grout! You just need a metric butt-load of glitter (sorry, no idea what that is in imperial...)
The total nonchalance when Katelyn stuck her finger in Evan's mouth 😂
Okay, now I'm a little tempted to try making cat toys out of fur from and for our 14 year old cats...
Please do a video testing the glitter grouts on the market since they do exist. There are premade ones and then there are 'glitter additives' but I'd also like to see you guys diy your best (or most cursed) decorative grout ideas.
I left a diy bad idea in the comments of a previous video 😫 if only I knew about this email ordeal it could have made the video 😅 I don’t do the social medias anymore as it’s bad for my mental health
I need a bean board!!!
Would it be possible for you to test how to color traditional grout? Like with glitter? Alcohol ink? And other possible coloring agents?
Lol "paw-sitive"
Sooooo I love how the chicken Nugget jewelry came out!!!
0:06 each Video Idea Sounds better than the Last. I want them all. Except taste Testing Resin, but I'm Sure you'll Figure Out a Freaky way for that too...  Edit: lol, putting the "oh No" at 0:10 totally ignoring the toxic Resin tasting that's right next to it is so ironic and so typical E&K X-D
I’m pretty sure the reason why we use grout instead of hot glue is because once grout sets its set because grout is literally just a cement. Whereas hot glue… i mean I’ve seen hot glue melt without a heat gun (40°C days are fun, that’s over 100 in Fahrenheit if you’re wondering) and so it would probably melt in high heat situations (so one very steamy shower, or if you grout kitchen splash backs)   Also… you can get/make glittery grout? So glitter grout is totally a viable option :D
can't believe a glitter fiend like Katelyn doesn't know about glitter grout
As soon as i saw the chicken nugget suggestion i cried out with laughter! I have had this idea for ages but i need to make the mould. I asked a friend of mine to 3d print me a chicken nugget and it was the weirdest request ever. Iam going to be making the holochicken nugget series of jewellery i think haha I must send you one when i get them made!
the felt cat toy reminds of Mr. Blik from Catscratch
I'm so surpised the nugget jewelry wasn't dino nuggets!
Thank lort that you chaptered this...I couldn't do the cat hair thing... GACK!
Since the beancuterie board is shaped like one of those college paddles, you should paint either your E&K logo or make up a college fraternity greek letters and hang it up somewhere in your house 😂
They make glitter grout and it’s actually so cute 😭🤚🏻
Well this was a truly disturbing watch 10/10
Anyone else kinda wish they did Dino nuggies??
The chicken nuggets looked more like glazed donuts since the resin is glossy but I still love them regardless 😂
I like how basically all of this ideas are things they would also come up with Makes me happy to know Evan, Katelyn and their fans all share a brain cell
love the new cinimatography!
Cursed cheeks
Brb, gonna be collecting my fluffy cat's fur for the next several years
Not that you'd want to use it still but I wonder if you sanded the surface of the toothbrush first before flocking, maybe it would stick better. And if you just wanted to flock another brush for ✨decor✨ 😅 you could try masking fluid around the base of the bristles and then the tape on top, I think that could make it less susceptible to the flocking seepage. Side note, I think this is one of the most unique things I've ever had to think about 😂 but it's awesome
You missed an opportunity to use Dino nuggets 😢
My sister would love that there Bean Board. She LOVES BEEEANNNS!!! And Charcuterie XD
*shakes headand walks away, speechless*
love the mini joob, but who’s going to tell them about glitter grout?
It’s actually very dangerous for cats when they eat, or play with string, because sometimes they can interest pieces of string, which can sometimes tie around their organs and can be life-threatening to the cat. Even though the procedure to get this done is fairly simple it is still very dangerous so I suggest that any cat owners or dog owners, or anyone with pets in general please be extremely careful when getting your dog or cat or animal companion a toy that has a lot of strings or has a string on it because it can be dangerous to your pet
Can't stop laughing at the chicken jewelry!
Black cats and black dogs are usually sable which is a very, very dark brown that looks black in most lights but shows up brown in direct sunlight and such. It's beautiful.
You know this intro was dramatized because the Supurrvisior would never delete the idea for an automatic ham dispenser 😹  Also, can we actually get a catio and cat-cus for humans? 😻
if you do a part 2 at any point I vote that the teeth should also get flocked
… im eating chicken nuggets as im watching chicken nuggets be covered in resin
Amazing. Just a heads up, don't let Joob play with herself unsupervised. Cats have an instinct to eat their own fur when they find it, and too much can cause an upset kitty tummy.
Don't feel like you have to make videos if you don't have ideas. I know youtube can be awful in that respect but take all the time ya'll need, we'll wait for you! Love your videos and channel so much!!!! <3    Keep up the fantastic work~!
this made me so sad...
🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
you should make velvet teeth too
Who the fu*k uses yahoo though? Gmail master race
I feel like tax time must be ridiculous/hilarious for you guys. "Yes, the beans ARE a business expense!!"
Glitter grout is a thing now FYI
I loved the bean board. You should flock it!1
15:56 He FLOCKED ME with A *TOOTHBRUSH*
22:25  btw, glittergrouts exist actually :P Or if not in Your local stores, then You can just mix punch of glitter in regular grout ;)
Who needs a sheep when you have a cat
The little felted Joob is so cute! I can’t wait to see your first attempt at felting, I’m looking to get into felting as a hobby, and it’s always fun to see you both try new crafts to share with us. I can relate to being surprised at Joob’s shed fur being lighter than herself, my old boy would shed his undercoat that looked very dark grey instead of black. Hair/fur is just magic like that 😊
That was funny :D thank you for making it fun and interesting :)
This video was hilarious 😂 also! There is such a thing as glitter grout! Mia maples has done it a couple times on her channel 😊
Felt Supervisor looks like she has a Markiplier pink mustache, still cute though 🥰
...okay now velvet these teeth
Now I want to see velvet teeth.
Chaos
Hey, just thought of something. What if you freeze dried some fruits or something and stabilized them with stabilizing resin? Maybe this would also worked with the nuggets?? idk
The image at the end of both of you leaning back with salami on your eyes sitting in front of a charcuterie board made of beans.... when you started your YouTube journey selling handmade cement coasters did you know this is where you'd end up??
SO CURSED from start to finish!
isn't resin not food safe?
Omg! Does Kaytlen not know about glitter grout? It was pretty poping in renovation tiktok last year
Loved this video! Thank you!
Now I want chili.... Got to go soak some beans.... in water.... Haha good job guys! Love the Joob!
this is what five minute craft wish they were with their crazy ideas
19:21 Just 19:21
"We're not crazy people"  -- The lady that just made a cat out of cat hair
I wish you made the teeth velvet well at least the gums
For the hot glue, here is an electronics tip that would work for you: if you use Kapton tape which is the heat resistant tape that can be used to protect electronics BUT can also be used to shape hot glue around electronics. Placing a layer of tape over the gap and grouting from behind will leave a clean, molded look.
fACK DIDN'T SEE THIS, PLEASE DO FIDGET TOYS AND TEST THEIR EFFICIENCY OF EVAN
How desperate does yahoo have to be for people to use it for it to sponser YouTube videos 😂
Guys, this may be a long shot, but something about Evan and Katelyn changed. They changed like my parents did, when my parents got my little brother. And their jokes are different.  Also Katelyn just acts different and dresses more baggy clothes than the past few years. I don't know if I am right, but I think Evan and Katelyn got pregnant.  I have been watching them for years and watched every video a good few times, so I really think I could be on to something
Oh man missed opportunity to use Dino nuggets for the earings instead of regular ones 😂.
you can actually get glitter grout btw! xD
We have the same needle felting tool. Though mine sat for 10 years before being used for  the first time ( it was my mom's)
no more total boat sponsorship?
I'm not even halfway through this video and I already know I need another one. 🤣  Seriously love what you guys do <3
I'm so hungry for chicken nuggets now..
Next cursed idea: velvet grill. Like a novelty gold or jeweled teeth grill but just velveted.
You should try and do those d and d dice that have liquid inside the resin
"we don't have access to a baby"... We'll, hear me out😂😂😂😂
Hot glue will look ugly when dust sticks to it.
Gentle reminder to not prepare food on resin. No matter how sturdy your beans
the bean board kinda looks like minecraft lava...
Note that evan poured the glitter- still traumatized from (aka one of my all time favorite and least favorite E&K moments of last year)
"My ears are in pain 😀" -Katelyn 2023
I demand more bad DIY idea videos from us
Even and Katelyn don't know that they have glitter Grout.
Best video ever. 😂 more of this please!
Also filter grout is a thing I know from @miamaples channel, pretty cool
Be careful with cat or dog hair felting or spinning, some fur babies want to eat their own fur.
I have a weird thing for y’all to do a resin cat statue or felted cat fur earings
...there is a book on crafting with cat hair. Just, y'know, sayin'.
Velvet this fake gums??
What about velvet teeth?
„Why do we even have that button?“ has the same energy as „WHY DO WE EVEN _HAVE_ THAT LEVER?“
When i saw the thumbnail, i thought you were going to flock the teeth, not the toothbrush. Would like to see it
The chicken gems need to be given to McDonald’s workers and other places that serve chicken nuggets upon request of the employees lol  Aaah they made Joob a baby Joob to groom.
Watching you brush those fake teeth fills my mouth with imaginary needles it's so bad
Champions of B-roll
There is fancy glitter grout! My dad and stepmom have it on the kitchen walls. It's not as glittery as the glue stick, but still pretty glittery
The fact that you didn't give mini joob toe beans is atrocious
Hmm I think a Chicken Nugget Ear Cuff would work as well, so you don't accidentally tear your ear lobes from the weight
I can't believe i missed this upload because i was watching older videos 😂
Yahoo mail....My dream has come true!!! It's the 90s again!!
There are no truly black animals in nature, they are all shades of brown. True black is not a colour, it is the absence of colour.
very good
Idk if you've made one of these but maybe make one of those big geode resin things for the wall.  Please use purple 💜🫶🏻  Resin phone cases?
A hot air gun helps when using hot glue in unconventional ways. Don't like all the stringers? A few seconds of the hot air gun cleans stringers up instantly. Did the glue cool too quickly making things lumpy? Hit it with the hot air gun, then smooth it. Need to unstick something? Hot air gun! (or rubbing alcohol).
But a catio for humans.  Like a people-catio, or, patio, if you will.
Ham?
*I have the perfect project. Try making a Cloisonné table top.* Super glue flat brass wire to a table to make patterns. Fill with different colors of frit and cover with resin.
Rice Krispie.... but with resin?
You should make a catwalk! A cat skywalk across the top of your room made of clear resin so you can watch the manager walk around above your heads! You could see her little beans!
isnt resin extremely not food safe ? should you guys be eating off the beans resin board ?
Wow the velvet toothbrush was good but what if you make a velvet pumpkin 🎃🤔
I makes me sad to think about the chicken that had to lose its life for the jewelry, next time could you use something with less trauma attached to it. I love your videos but I couldn't stop thinking about the chickens during that segment.
How about you guys try to make a diorama of a landscape, or try doll customising (both are harder than they look)
Very glad to have contributed to this chaos.
I don't think that I've ever seen Joob love something you've made for her so much 😭😭
Am I the only one who thought they were going to flock the teeth😂
Are you kidding?! The cat toy is a 100/10! 🤩🤣
You need to make this a series, there is so much potential to cursed ideas!
the way she reacted to the jooboo doll makes me assume the "joob floof" still really smells like joob 🤔
carpeted bathroom
You needle felting Joob's fur reminds me that I should have a bag of my first cat's fur somewhere...
could not help noticing, the resin is covered as before it showed totalboat logo bcs they worked together. Did their partnershio ended?
All i could think about was cleeps when they were talking about cheeks
who the flock wants a velvet toothbrush?!
Not gonna lie, I was expecting Evan to use a prong like stick to attach to the chicken nuggets haha  EDIT: I didn't expect the ending. I didn't know what to do with myself there
Wait, is katelyn unaware of glitter grout? It was a trend for like 2 seconds
That little cat is ridiculously cute! 🥹
The cat fur felted cat toy takes "you've shed a whole 'nother cat!" to a new level 😂
Flock the teeth!
You should NOT be using resin for cutting boards. Cheese platters sure, that's not gonna see much cutting action, but not cutting boards.
King I love her little joob self!!!!! Her joob toy
Should have put velvet on the handle of the board. 🤣
There is defo glitter grout on the market! 😂
lol "we dont have access to a baby". THAT is your reason why you wouldn't cast a baby in resin??
I wonder if you can make cat fur into clothing. I wonder how much Joob would hate a winter kitty coat made of her own fur.
Glitter grout exist 😂 😂
Now i need to see a whole bean set with dishes and everything
Aaaw... That's cute.... Must be nice 🥺 my ADHD brain has given me ideas for 189 lifetimes and still they keep coming 🤪
re: the last one - I thought resin wasn't food-safe. Should you be eating off of it?
I definitely didn't order maccies because of this
Is yahoo even still a thing....??
The nuggie jewelry is definitely a vibe!
This was one of my favorite videos yet lmao
I really hope you didn't eat off of that cutting board. I'm pretty sure resin isn't actually foodsafe.
Glitter grout actually does exist, and I bet it would make for some very interesting projects I your hands!
Now I want those teeth to have velvet gums
Whoa wait have yall not heard of glitter grout add ins?? 😮
22:22 I literally have glitter grout in my kitchen? Hello?
I still want you to use resin and Rice Krispies to make furniture or some other item that looks like it's made out of Rice Krispy Treats.
Happy to see I’m not the only person who saves my pet’s fur.
I love how u guys are always so creative and u are SO frickin positiveee   Edit: also, I wanna say a big thank you for being there for us, cuz u have helped me with my mental health issues a lot  and I really appreciate  that. Just ur goofy energy and all was smth unique for me and I think that all the other subscribers of yours would agree with me<333. Hope u see this, coz I really want you to know how much you mean to me and how much you have done for us!
The bean cutting board is 100/10
I've needle felted my cats' fur! It works beautifully!  I actually felted my friend's favorite kitty that passed with the fur of my cats as a gift for her. I know it seems weird, but it was nice!
se imaginan husmear en la basura de Evan y Katelyn , que interesante🤣🤣🤣
THE CAT HAIR JOOB IS SO CUUUUUUTE!!!!!!
A hundred and 10 pd great Pyrenees/akbash/Italian mastiff/Anatolian puppy that owns us has managed to destroy every toy we have bought for him...please find a playful non destructible toy.
Flock the teeth or the gums lol
:( I miss the dance you guys did for resin time. And evens voice needs to be added to the song too!!
Wait, yahoo is still a thing?
I thought the toothbrush was just going to be flocked for the handle, but they went all the way 😂😂 nice as usual
Great video! ...my one complaint is that they didn't use Dino nuggets...and now I'm hungry.
The absolute coincidence of me eating chicken nuggets while watching the chicken nugget earrings DIY. Like, no joke, heard the idea being mentioned at the exact SECOND I went to put one in my mouth lmao
So, would you guys like to be made aware that glitter grout and colored grout, absolutely does exist!
Ngl I can see that velvet toothbrush be inside the bathroom of some rich influence xD. They don't use it but it's in the shots just to show how rich they are lol.
Do something with carbon fibre, it’s resin, it’s new to u, and it’s interesting if you make something nice. All the best luck
I barely knew Yahoo was still around
I hope you guys pick out a large project that spans multiple videos.
You should cover the necklace nugget in gold leaf , GOLD NUGGET
I didn’t even realize that yahoo was still a thing.
i was hoping you were gonna flock the teeth velvet teeth
If you pour it thick enough you could cook a baby in resin too
3:49 Eugene?
Can y’all make earrings out of resin that look like chicken nuggets? :D
Great video as always! Hope you guys get well soon!!
I'll never get over the mini joob, she loves it because it looks and smells like her and it's so adorable 😭
If you're still looking for ideas, then I would suggest making personalized Venetian masks with all kinds of fancy colorful designs.
Use some cardboard to make a model of your dream house
NOW FLOCK THE TEETH
holy cats. most of these were 100% cursed ideas... I love the cat fur felting though!
There's a whole book of cat hair felting ideas. It definitely felts well, it's just really fine and condenses down more than wool while you work with it
I honestly thought you were going to flock the teeth of the fake mouth.
18:21-18:27 MURDERED ME WHAT THE HECK KATELYN 😂😂😂😂😂
Embed a favorite person you don't like pic in the cutting board.
You can do glitter grout! It’s a thing!
something about seeing them cover chicken nuggets in glittery resin, which SHOULD be wrong and gross, and yet when it's evan and katelyn doing it, it just feels natural and normal lol...
RIP Yahoo
The bean cutting board is perhaps your pièce de résistance! I sincerely and desperately want one
I can't believe we'll never get to see a video about a chair made of beans. Sadly, that idea has been lost forever, and there's no way to retrieve it.
true love is when he overpours the beans in your bean charcuterie board and then spends 30mins painstakingly taking them out 🥹😆💖
I thought we shouldnt eat off resin???
Can't do grout with glitter? Clearly they don't watch mia maples lulul
I love when you guys have these ideas and it makes my day thank you so much for being here and making videos you are AMAZING
You could have just... Ctrl Z. That would have restored it all...
Thats an interesting sponsor. I get picked on for using a yahoo email address as my main email. By main I mean my junk email that I use for everything. I then of course have my more "professional email" accounts but I really do like the yahoo app. The tracking of packages thing is really nice. Its not perfect but its nice. However when they added ads to it and they just looked like normal emails I got pretty upset. Thankfully they stopped that. But hey I am glad you guys got a new sponsor. But I have a feeling we are about to see everyone get sponsored by them which im fine with. I am so tired of Raid and the VPN sponsors.
I love this cursed things era you two are in (*´︶｀*)
JUST SO YOU KNOW, actual glitter grout 100% exists in real life.  No idea where you get it, but I’ve seen it in real life.
22:25 actually glitter grout exists now
jewlery out of dead animals 1/10 on ideas....playing with cat hair...eww 2/10....toothbrush..0/10 you already know..glue grount...3/10...beans.........0/10 ...do you need ideas....you can make a chicken coup...intergrade catio on top......you can make a new cat wheel that produces electric...make a device that pulls power from the air.(zero point energy) you can make something that lets your cat talk. you can make resin paintings with led accents....love you guys. good luck in 2023!
12:40 the little felt kitty looks and reminds me of Baba Is You 😭
I have to say as much as I enjoyed the entire video this moment right here (29:40) had to be my favorite by far! 🤭
Oh wow I will make a mini cat for my cat when I finally have a cat!
I wonder if you gave the cat hair a tiny spritz of hair spray to give it texture, if that would make it a little more wool like
The Joob blemp at 9:49 😭💕
Katelyn's smile was so cute in the up close shots in the bloopers 🥺
I kept looking at the toothbrush and thinking  "They killed and slaughtered Elmo to make toothbrushes" This is so cursed.
Joobie Junior was soooo cute! It was like her little baby! Joob herself is also looking purrfect as always! 🥰
LMAO KAITLYN JUST YEETING THE BOX-😂
Gosh darn it I missed the idea sharing! Hopefully some day they’ll get into chia seed projects anyway because I’d love to see a chia phone case or key board and see what other stuff they come up with!
Covering the nuggets in resin made me think about donuts and how the resin would make them look like glazed donuts.....
Glitter grout is an actual thing!! You can buy ready to use glitter grout and just slap it on your walls. No need for hot glue lol.
The smooth side of the bean board lowkey looks like Minecraft lava
You guys should ho on vacation? Thats a video idea for ya
Lol ;p
Please do this again! It was such an interesting idea.
22:23+ "there's some things that u can't do with grout[...] like having it be full of glitter'   weeell.... isn't this a wonderrful world of ours that one CAN have glitter grout and it's been one of my adult dreams for my future house hahahaha :v it looks amazing specially with dark tiles
1:39 the main problem that make them don't do that cuz they did not have access to a baby🤣🤣
Love this video lol 😂😂
The chicken nugget jewelry is kinda cool tbh
The chicken nugget idea just seems like the type of thing some random a-lister would wear to some award ceremony
I'm both curious and terrified to hear how the nugget jewelry smells in a month.  Also "I've been collecting a bag of cat's hair...for reasons...." Joob...are you okay? Meow Twice for no.
can you make more tensegrity items and infinity mirror items. I feel like i didn't get enough when you made them previously
Katelyn: “Some days you just wake up and say today I’m gonna flock a toothbrush.”  Insert H3 Podcast soundbite: “FLOCKA”
Glitter grout is in fact a thing; I had it in our house growing up! ☺ Ahaha I will never forget my mother making a big stink to my father about having it cause she wanted it and he didn't; obviously we know who won that argument! 😂
GLITTER GROUT EXISTS!! just fyi 🙃😉
They do sell glitter grouting 😁 Mia Maples also made a video using glitter in her bathroom 💡
Hey guys! Fun fact but there are glitter add-in for grout and its actually a really cool effect! Its sold under the name or Starlike at home depot and there's some other random brands online!
i imagine if you took a hot shower with hot glue grout it would melt lol
Cabitt Joob is fabulous!  Also, very disappointed you didn't flock the gums.  QQA!
There is actually glitter grout. Also I had an idea for a project the dice board you made for the light up dice upgrade it.
5 minute crafts been real quiet since this video dropped
My husband (who has ulcerative colitis) and I (might have IBS??) DO indeed have to poop at the same time. ✨️
A kitty kat made out of kitty kat? impressive
Hey Evan Katelyn how about  fruity pebbles cereal in resin
I love how Evan continues to ignore Katelyn when she tries to control his chaos 🤣💀
The funny thing i thought you would do the whole toothbrush. As a joke.
And replace the fin on you selling fans with resin ones
Cat hair is notorious for felting in the very niche “spinning yarn from pet hair” community.
Sometimes I wonder "Why do their craft videos take so long?" ...and then I see a video like this and think "Ohh... I see, never mind."
Send that cutting board to Rhett from GMM. He loves beans.
I rate this video idea 10/10
The cutting board looks like teeth in blood
My only question is is the bean cutting board food safe???
Such wonderful DIY projects! 😊
Katelyn is just so beautiful 😭  28:45
You've made an oob!! from joob/jube? That's a new product but not using her hair. Otherwise, she'll be bald in no time, for all the requests for them. NOTE:  l gave the squishy cuddly job to a very close friend as she had unfortunately lost one of her cats . He was 8 y.o and a Main Coon cat and a cutie pie ❤️(^-^)/ IT wasn't to replace him but something to cuddle when she missed him.  You should have cut some in half as you get in normal beans in Tom sauce.
All things joob. Joob themed resin stained glass. Joob shaped chair! Joob shaped hats! All the joob!
Now that you have an extra set of teeth, you could make them velvet too... 😁😉👌 That would be cursed, velvety teeth... 😵‍💫
There is an additive you can get for grout to make it glittery. Mia Maples has used it a few times. It is not a glittery as your hot glue grout but its worth looking into if you want something like that lol. Great video guys.
I love the mini Joob out of cat hair. That was so cute and Joob seems to love it. Such an amazing video. I hope you are doing well and I hope you have a wonderful day.
You totally could put glitter in grout... you should try it
On another site, I saw that the person has a cool set up that hooks two containers of resin up so that one pump of the handle pumps out the correct amount of both resin parts.  Have you looked into this?
Hey you should take them fake teeth you got and flock the gums
There is a such thing as glitter grout
Imagine Joob's confusion when she realised her new toy smells just like her lol
The first idea is the chip earrings 2.0
"Would you care to open the cheeks?" It's not that kind of channel!! LMAO
This video radiates cursed energy 😂 - Joob tried to save you from the gelatin toilet seat (even at the cost of an automatic ham dispenser? Truly a selfless hero.) but we still ended up with:  -“we don’t have access to a baby” -“we could have made a hamburger pendant instead” -“CHEEK SIMULATION” -“salami eye patches”  Was this extremely wild video worth it? For felted Joob - yeah. 🐈‍⬛  (Everyone knows wholesome cat content cancels out excess chaos.)
Damn. Velvet toothbrush is way more cursed than what I sent, wish I thought of that instead of velvet doorknob.
Your chaotic energy really shows in this video Lol
Katelyn's creepy stare while saying they don't have access to a baby had me cackling
What a Mercury Retrograde ad and video explanation😅💕👌
When working with hot glue you should just wet your finger and then you can easily sculpt and mold while the glue is warm.  Zero clean up! Also - I had the thought that, when doing the resin rotisserrie (and for some other projects) you could catch the initial resin that falls off in a second cup and then pour that back over the piece! That way you would save as much resin as possible!
The resin is not sponsored, is there finally a project they think too cursed to be sponsored by them?
The cat hair cat toy was definitely katelyns idea, she just blamed us for it 🤣😭
This was like something I had no interest in, but couldn't look away and stop watching.
You've created  southern bbq for Barbie n Ken, awaiting the arrival of GI Joe and the Marvel Universe Hero doll party 🥳 🎉 to see that Hawkeye is getting better.  They got to heavy for the wire, possibly next time 2 wires 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆
Where's the gold mica powder? Golden chicken nugget 😉
it's not something im familiar with, but could you put dye and glitter in grout?
how's the pumkin?
I've been trying to figure out the best way to seal those Pokemon Oreos from like 2 years ago. I wonder if resin is the answer
Joob's like "oooh, hoomans gave joobie a baby!"
You could totally use resin for glittery grout instead of hot glue, and it might actually be decent.
The first two ideas made me nauseous while watching 🥴
Love how the chicken nuggets were just… slowly giving up on life…
should've done dino nuggets </3
you need to flock the actually teeth to make something truly cursed
nugget
Make more resin key caps or make molds
They actually make glitter grout but idk if it comes in different colors like hot glue
For another video idea, a 3d, multi layer resin painting. I was thinking of the supervisor in her space suit, in space, in a block of resin. You can check out drawing with jazza for the instructions and inspo. I love your channel and you personality’s. You make my day better❤️
Is that flocking powder made with fiberglass? It shines like fiberglass. Isn’t fiberglass terrible for ppl?
Didn't know that cat wool was even a thing but here we are.
Okay, those video ideas at the start are WAY too funny omg. I wanna see chair made of beans and catio for humans asap!
"Fancy chicken nugget earrings" Maybe it's because I haven't been here long enough but it still sounds so cursed to me xD
Ah yes, it is 2AM at Malaysian but yet I am watching this, I always love you guy because Evan is so chaotic and the epic edit, I will enjoy your future video.
I thought you were joking or making fun of your use of Yahoo mail as a bad email address to send bad ideas to.  I didn't think it was a promotion.
Or make a resin superviser sculpture
Was almost expecting them to flock the fake teeth after they did the toothbrush.
Cursed but I'm glad these exist and were tried out.
oh i LOVE the felted cat!! and joobie does too!! probably cuz it smells like her
Why do i want to eat the chicken nugget still?
"We would never cast a baby in resin. We don't have access to one" -E&K
10:14 I don’t know why, but cotton/fibers tearing sends more chills down my spine than nails on a chalkboard. See also: using cotton balls or Q-tips on through-hole solder joints.
Make Joobie a bigger needle felted  plush. Gonna need a lot more JoobFur tho
Yahoo must really be struggling if they've resorted to sponsorships lol. Good video though!
What if y'all made a resin Christmas tree but everything is a resin event the tree and also do something seasonal stuff out of resin
I was talking to someone at an event last month, and mentioned I work with resin myself. They then proceed to ask about how the best way to make a Froot Loops necklace would be  If I had seen that post where you asked for ideas I would've sent that
Joob's hair likely isn't fully black because of time spent in the sun. My black cat suffers the same thing, she'll look dark brown in the right light. The sun has essentially "bleached" the melanin in her fur, causing it to lighten from a true black.
Im hvng bad time now right at this very moment. Struggling to push away all this bad intrusive thoughts. Thank you so very much for the upload. I’m surely gonna watch this video hopefully able to bring myself to sleep too. Your content has always been my safe place to be. Love you both.
Glitter grout exists!!!
Glitter grout :Am I a joke to you?! 😭
Kenny Rodgers saw this and has ideas of a comeback!
No.
The thumbnail jumpscared me
needle felting the cat hair was naaaasty. I love it <3
Great lesson on why spinny doodads usually have two posts instead of a single post 😂
At the county fair a few years ago I ran into a woman doing crafts with dog hair shed, she had spun it into yarn, with a spinning wheel, and was using it on a little loom to weave a piece of fabric, so I'm not surprised about cat hair felting.
You should try making resin glasses 🤓 with themes like galaxy, dried flowers, led etc, and then add lenses
I'm glad I didn't skip the ad. Seeing Katelyn chuck that box was great!
I love that the only reason they wouldn't cast a baby is the lack of access
Cursed idea: felt your toaster. So long as it’s only the outer plastic casing and it’s one of those that the outer casing doesn’t get hot, you can have a velvet toaster
This is one of my favorite Evan and Katelyn videos of all time. Great job E&K!
Yahoo stil alive?
Please be careful which comments you reply to evan and katelyn. Unfortunately there are way too many scam accounts in the beginning of vids being uploaded.
More E & K food videos. Will it ice cream , try making odd ice cream flavors or bizarre mix-ins added to a traditional base
C h a i r  m a d e  o f  b e a n s
We’re you collecting joob hair for needle felting or we’re you collecting joob hair… 🤨 joob has a friend now anyways 😆
You guys should built a 3D-Printer that is using Hotglue
Lol how do the nuggets look like amber 😂
Omg I’m early yay 😀
Evan and Katelyn, doing what we all want to do
I like how for the baby idea, them not having a baby is the only set back 💀
Perhaps making a silicone mold of a few nuggets and making them of full resin would be rad
omg yessssss
😂 Well the beginning of this video started out great!  The ideas people have are both amazing and terrifying
Ooohh poopah poopah! I thought for sure we'd finally get to see how you implemented your lovers toilets idea from house flipper. :)
yay 0:23
I mean you obviously can't make chicken nugget earrings and NOT make them ✨FANCY✨
This video is the best thing after an exam
i liked when they used the cnc and 3d printers for stuff, resin every single video. sigh.
hi
1:33 i love that they don't say no
You guys should make more resin and wood tables or side tables, that would be awesome
Hi from Australia
Omg I love you guys and I sing out loud every resin tan
My rooster his name is nugget 😅
Worst ideas? You mean the best ideas.
"We cant do that, we dont have access to a baby"🌝👀
We don't have access to babys would you do it if you did
Dont have access to a baby ? Make one ! Its DIY !
I enjoy all of your videos!  😍 Have you guys ever thought about making a dice tower?
You guys are amazing  Love you guys and all your amazing wierd ideas❤️
Yay! First here! I love you both! Your videos always crack me up! 🤣
The search history 😭 ps. Love your channel guys! Don’t stop doing what you love!
