The opps rejoice
I grew up to you Scump. Since 2012. I'm heartbroken still.
Thanks for the memories  You are the best competitive Call of Duty player to ever touch the game. Beyond grateful to have watched you in your prime growing up. This video gave me chills and made me sad a bit, but I'm appreciative of all the fun times watching you and I'll never forget it.   Love
Love this video honestly 💙
the chants is what really got me tearing up. what an amazing org and an amazing fan base.
GOAT🏆

Extraño jugar con mis amigos gamers
New optic fan and my god this was so well made.
my heart breaks every time i see this.
Hanging them gloves up eh scump good for you, time to move on with your life
Childhood gone 😢
The Goat 🐐
It’s not the same without you @Scump
damn.. i hadn't been up to date on scump in quite a while.. even so, that still hit me. that was a really powerful picture of him looking back on where he started and everything he's accomplished. He looked at it all and was content and satisfied.
We grew up together. Love it man.
I retired a couple years ago. was thinking about making a comeback at the start of the season. I just seen this video and honestly because of you I’m gonna put my focus on different things in life.  I hope your still living your best life.  you’ll be remembered as a real cod legend you definitely left a great legacy. Goodbye champ
Legendary
one of the founding fathers your legacy will live on forever thru call of duty and competitive call of duty
shotzzy, the next best thing after scumpii
Bo2 we’re the days I will always miss
One of the reasons I am who I am today is because of this guy , coming back to re watch this video makes me tear up man end of an era doesn’t even begin to describe it.
That “he’s getting cross map kills with the scorpion!” Made me tear up
Hope retirement treats you well buddy you were the BO2 legend and a Optic Legend as well hope to see content once in awhile to keep us updated
The goat 🐐
The Pupils dialate when you see something you love. that touch added was perfect
The Goat's dying 😥😥😥, Also end of era? ok w/e... but imo competitive cod has been over. These maps? these maps aren't going to cut it.... the speed is slow, the guns are like playing Halo but everyone only has an AR, no no no no no, Advance Warfare 2 is our only chance. We need speed... MW 2019 was sooooooooooooooooooooo good and now we get this? The pubs are pay to win... the operators, there's 5000 operators and they're all ugly af... the guns you have to buy (only reasonable now) are ugly af.... these maps aren't going to cut it... who the fuck designed the maps? they don't make since...  To get to an object you have to cross the Sahara on foot... and then die and do it again... but in this Sahara there's giant buildings and lines of trucks and 859632964.214 windows and shit you can get killed from while you stomp your ass all around down town, climbing stairs, opening doors, crossing streets... as per fucking usual the only good maps are from the past... MW 2019 was 10,000X better than this game... fix the fucking slide, how hard is it to put the slide back to how it was? Also, why does it take 90 minutes plus credits to swap to a pistol, and then fire rate of pistol is slower than a bolt action... and of course it takes 28.5 years to unlock attachments. so buy guns? you best buy a gun or two, or else you might as well throw your life away with the hours you'll be putting in getting shit on with shit guns... have you played the maps?  So long story short... competitive cods dead...

I’m a little disappointed that Ian Porter wasn’t in this video. Not that I hate Scump, in fact, I love this guy.
Thank you for all the memories and hype over the years!!!!
We will run into each other see you soon scumpii
i’m quitting cod.
i been watching ever since around 2013 when  he dropped that nuke on hijacked with the KSG And DSR 50, this makes me want to quit cod aswell, 😢 not gonna be the same without scump .
The only guy too get laid and still look like a power virgin. 😂💕 it’s all love
When you say in the crowd & watched yourself 💔😢
Goodbye e ropt ten npidh ti qifsha scump
This video is amazing. The idea and execution…it’s a two minute masterpiece.
This is kinda beautiful ngl
we can all agree that this goat gave us all great memories in cod, a legend man enjoy retirement.
Yo this was sad bro
i have no idea who he is but i will him well 🙏
You’ve grown up and you are doing bigger and better things respect the kid life is over it’s adult hood
The more you “retire” the more of you I see! Lol! 😂
thank you.
It all started with a lot of free time and an xbox back in the early 2000s. Like so many of us. Man. Time has flown by
Why did you team up with CHEATER NADIA  You lost my respect!!!
Fucking chills man
I can’t relate to everyone else when they say they have watched you for years and years but just watching this video I could really see the immense impact you had on the gaming community and just people in general. Good luck in the future
Masterpiece whoever directed this
This didn’t age very well
calm down is just garbage cod, move on a to a game where you can actually make money.
End of an era. I was a huge Optic/competitive CoD fanboy from BO2 through AW, and always rooted Optic.  Now we see how good his money management is, having likely not finished highschool, and having no trade skills... His future will depend on how well he's managed that temporary golden goose.  But I always enjoyed the old days Scump/Nade public lobbies content back in the day. Hopefully he can keep a significant stream/YT channel based on teaming with old gen, cast-off pros.
all the majors this guy won some people only look at cod champs but this man truly has at least top 3 locked in number one for me scup ur a legend thx for the memories and cant wait for the new ones only to come
who made this video? i got to see behind the scenes
How many came back to this video after he officially retired 💔💔💔
🤯🤯
Scump will always be the KING!!!!
MWII so ass he retired early smh
The dance is over...
2 months later and scump officially retires from cod . What an amazing career and the great memorys you have produced , it has been a pleasure watching u over the years .
Class act, right to the very end
A lot of people will be coming back to this video after his shock early retirement on his last season, this is the end of an era in competitive Call of Duty and we thank you for all the great memories in your competitive career!
The King of Call of Duty
I thought we can have more time with you… just gonna say this 😣😓
I remember being 12 years old when I first started watching you... I'm 21 now. Think about that you have been such a staple for many of us in the COD community thank you Scump.  A True legend never dies.
who gives a shit, its a game
Well this video makes me even more sad now 😔
Dang. Who came back to rewatch this after the news today?
Will be missed 😢 Best to ever do it ! Fav Cod player 🗣️ ….
Cod  is not  beginning of the new era, It's the end of the era of call of duty
Fuckin goat man #optic4L💚
Damn that hurts... Since i was a Kid i've Always watched those Videos, streams etc.. even if i didn't unterstood them very Well... But through your carrer i've learned to understand and speak english... Dude you we're my whole childhood.. best wishes from Germany my man❤️  #onelastdance❤️ Love and Peace out bruh
Anyone here after his announced Retirement?
This hurts been watching scump and the optic team all the back in black ops 2.
I still can’t get over this video.. GOAT of Call Of Duty.. 😢
Long live king scump! enjoyed every moment of it over the last decade. amazing player and organization
Goat 🐐
Scump it's Amitzur bro you really going 😭
you were a monster in the esl cdl and youll be remember legend <3
1 of the first cod pros I watched, everyday I’d wait for your daily uploads after grinding all day! Hands down my favourite player of all gaming! KING T2P
Wow, this video was insane!
One of the Best Videos i have ever seen
I wont even watch cod when he’s done
Cod competitive will never be the same. The greatest player to ever touch a controller. 😢❤
I love Scump
This heart
I won't lie.. I teared up
dont know where the 10 years has gone. came across optic and you from watching nadeshots frag cup announcement where he would replace rambo for that event. now 10 years later you have done so much in this time and just watching you accomplish so much. hope the rest of this season is a great one and i cant wait to see what you do next.
well scump is rich enought to retire for 100 years
This actually hurts so bad, so many momeries ❤️
This feels weird, not in a bad way, but cause this vid just bring back so many memories in my teen days. When I made friends, the best friends ever. Bo2 is when it started for me. But me is when I started watching you. Saying goodbye to competitive is like saying goodbye to my friends that I’ll never see again. I’m still playing but no longer have friends anymore. I just hope that 1 day, I come across them somehow, and we can have that 1 custom match 1 last time. Well stump, you’ve been great, the greatest player of cod history. You stay you, and keep it real ✌🏻
If anyone wants the background song name it’s Flight by Hannah Parrott
As a teenager, I remember buying my rust bucket on wheels so I could drive to these small privately-hosted LANs with the aspirations to be a professional CoD player. Crimsix and Scump were my two biggest idols growing up. The weekends I came home with winnings, my parent's thought I was selling drugs lol nevertheless, those were the highlights of my teenager years and seeing this video pop up on my Youtube page throws me back in time to those very, special days.
please no scumpi…🥺💔💔
I just wish I could go back when life was easy. Didn’t know growing up would’ve gone by so fast miss zombies bo1 bo2 I use to spend days on bo2 and fall asleep while playing lol I just hate that I lost all my old friends when everyone upgraded to there new system I don’t think life will ever be that simple 10 years ago love you guys keep the community positive and strong
Why did I cry watching this 😅
N O O O O O O O O O O O O
😢😢😢💔💔💔
You lived my childhood dream that I never got too. Wish you all the best keep killing it.
Just turned 30 last July.. this hits home for me. I may not have been a Cod legend..but I have lived..and I definitely gamed. Letting go of things that you deeply treasure to the core is not easy. Just the end of a chapter my friend…the book is far from done. Godspeed scump ❤
The end of an Era :( the amount of joy and love i have for this game franchise because of you is incredible. One last ride. Long live the King
Call of Duty is dogshit. League of Legends superior game. :)
Wish you all the best in life
Much love scump!!!!!!! 💯 appreciate you brotha. Thank you 🙏
I’m so mad I haven’t watched you growing up im just starting to watch you more. Wish I could’ve been apart of the ride I can see it was an amazing journey! At least I get to watch your last year competing
Love you Scump.
You were my idle, thank you for everything
Got to meet you in person in 2015 at the UMG washington DC event and it was an experience I won't forget. Watching you drop a 50 bomb was amazing and hearing the crowd at the event was unreal. I still have the jersey I got you to sign back then and I always will, ain't no way am I letting go of that lol. But you are a legend of the game and an amazing person Scump I wish you nothing but the best! That event inspired a passion for esports in me that has only grown since that day and I can't put into words how much that means to me.
Man, I feel old after watching this. I was there from day one. What an incredible journey you took me on.
Bros talking about “one last dance” when he’s retiring fron a VIDEO GAME😂😂😂😂😂
You were my first fav player to watch and still are. Cod will never be the same for me. It's a sad day for cod, but we understand. Much love and best wishes, Scumpii!!!
Goosebumps the whole video, this was my childhood. Much love you will be missed.🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡❤️
Scump, Much thanks for personally making me a better COD player, and the laughs over the years. Best wishes on your content creation afterwards!
I wanted to be a MLG gamer because of you. My first ever call of duty video I ever saw on YouTube was one of your MW2 quick scoping montages in Favela. My teacher in 4th grade asked the class  what they wanted to be when they grew up & I said I wanted to be a professional MLG gamer & rightfully so they all laughed at me. You helped made it possible for gaming to become something that was more proud of doing rather than being ashamed for it. It wasn’t cool back then & it might not be for everyone now still , but you helped make it what it is today with the entire gaming community for how much it’s grown throughout the past 13 years. They say don’t hate the player but to hate the game, well Scump- you changed the game man. Thanks for everything
Best to ever do it. Get there one more time champ. 🐐
My cod idol.. I hope you continue streaming and making content
Why does this hurt my heart
Long live the king!
Watching this actually makes you realise how old you are …. I remember the days of the first Xbox , halo , Xbox 360/PS3 era …. just being young and loving life. Take me back man … 🥹🥹🥹🙏
This is sooo said the last of the optic OG is going to be done with competing . I remember back in 2012 or 2013  when i started playing cod and seeing you compete with nadeshot  was one of the best things ever. After that moment I’ve always wanted to make my own clan or join one. You and nadeshot where always the ones I looked up to in gaming. I hope you bring this years trophy back to the green wall scump
As a fan of FaZe from the age of 10, even watching you through your career is a testament that you’re the best to ever play this game. Thank you for the fun and amazing memories Scump!
You are the only reason I still play man, never gonna be the same
💚💚💚💚
My childhood man.
Hell yeah
Dude Ill never forget seeing you hold the big Trophy for the first time and seeing all your hard work over the years finally pay off. Thanks for making competitive COD so much fun fo watch, and COD so much fun to play.  God blessings to you and yours after this door closes. Optic Scumpy For Ever!!!
about time
No way ..
End of an era things really do change wow....
Easy for me to respond…Thank you.
Surprised you didn’t retire sooner…
The Xbox Halo scene brought tears to my eyes.
Sweatbannin - 88-0 Flawless
ooooo shittttt  make sure you remind them who they lost to let's gooo
I have been gaming since I was about 9 years old, started on xbox original, then moved to 360, Halo, then cod 4 I have been following since Optic Predator, and I can not tell you the amount of joy and inspiration I have gotten from you and that entire organization I have been a day one optic fan for the last 18 almost 19 years I will LITERALLY NEVER forget the amazing sleepless nights just trying to grind and hopefully be there one day, it didn't work out for me, but I felt the energy and passion you guys had for the game, and I just can't express my gratitude for you guys enough, thank you for all the memories and being the absolute best Era of gaming. Thank you boys! Till next time!
Great video, very powerful I’m sad to see you go even tho i never watched
Ive been watching u since u were on Quantic. Much love to u in the future!
Another video wich shows me that im getting older and older and nothing lasts for ever...
ggs
Hi
Seeing yours and nadeshot’s BO2 and competitive videos was such a great part of my teenage life. It helped me bond with my brother and cousins trying to be pros, grinding in league play 😂. Thank you and optic for being a bright spot in my childhood.
I’ve been watching you since you first came on the scene. Crazy I can remember watching you play with bigtymer and the og squad. It’s like part of my child hood ended for good. Thank you for all the good entertainment you’re one of the reasons I wanted to try YouTube and stuff back in the day and have tried off and on when work allows it. The pro scene would not be were it is today with out people like you nade hector formal.  Jkap. . Some of the ogs that really shaped what we see in the pro league and cod in general you guys have inspired many over the years and will continue to much love scumpii
The Goat 🐐  You will be missed 🙏
bro. top gamer
I was in tears watching this I’ve been watching scump since bo2 he’s been my idol for years playing call of duty I watched him win gold at Xgames I’ve seen it all it’s definitely not gonna be the same without him cod won’t be the same to me
Cringe
For every year you gave me hope and the ego, thank you, I am a comp player in every game just from you, and seeing you Spark everything you’ve ever done. I love you Scump, All hail the King of CoD
Hey scump been watching since black ops 2 and when I was 8-9 and now I’m 20 please don’t quit bro your the only person that that makes videos that makes me feel like a kid “I’m the best in the game baby”
Dang. Sad to see you go but happy for you to move on. I remember coming home from school and watching your BO commentaries- simpler times
Didnt he say the same like 3 years ago and then came back?
Didnt he say the same like 3 years ago and then came back?
:')
the popularity of Battle Royale ruined gaming! smh
Scumpy with the dumpy 😭
32 now still check up from time to time thank you for all the great memories and the streaming time you and the crew put down it was a awesome journey and one as a community will never forget
Thank you very much for your hard work for a long time,legend I still admire you good luck in your last year as a codpro  You are best COD player scump
Anyone else feel incredibly sad watching this 😭😭
made me emotional started watching you when i was 14 truly an end of an era best days were on 360 for sure those days and memories will never die
Man I would stay up all night watching you wreck havoc and getting nukes; go to school and then come back home and try to be like you. Seth it was an honor just watching you play.
Thank you
I can't wait until I hear you calling my name as an announcer, you'll see me scumpy
Goodbye
Some of the best memories were with you in black ops 2 forever call of duty royalty
grow up
Seeing the old Optic House setup hit me. I remember watching those streams.
Only thing hotter than his COD skills is his Mom!
This gave me chills, thank you for the memories. Game will never be the same
R.I.P
😢❤
Bro I’m gonna cry my whole childhood was scump🥺
thanks for making COD such a fun game to watch
Thank you scump for everything you've done. You made my teen years some of the best, still to this day I go back and watch your best moments in Cod history. #BrickByBrick #GreenWall
Seeing the old Xbox setup with Halo 2 really hit
Since I started playing call of duty back in mw3, scump was the top. You knew many national player, many beasts but nobodys gettin over scump. I'm 22 now, he almost get it through the half of my entire life. Shit kinda crazy
Actually teared up man. Since I was in elementary all I had to fall back on was my games that I had. I’ve been watching u since elementary and since BO2 and ur skill level is entirely unmatched, the way you can stack up kills on other pros in CDL tournaments like it’s nothing is ridiculous. The GOAT of CoD easily. You had a great career and u grew a bunch. Ball out and live easy ❤
So sad to watch this man my favorite pro cod player gonna miss watching you play brother😢
Unfortunate It’s a combination of things. Cod battle royale being introduced, SBMM, cod sucking EVERY year haven’t had a good polished one since BO4. So this isn’t scump consensually retiring, but rather the game as a whole/developers forcing him too. Sucks to see you go king scumpii, but I don’t blame ya I’d fold too if I had the hand you’re dealt every year…
Blessings you touched many
legend
Proud of you   You’re a Goat 🐐
im not crying youre crying
It took me 4 weeks to watch this. Because Seth, you’ve changed the world without even knowing. Thank you for all you’ve done brotha, I can’t wait to see what great things you accomplish next💯🤝🫡 greenwallforever.
We will miss u scump
One last ride can’t wait to watch and can’t wait to see the content you put out next!!
Tear it up !!!
#GREENWALL💚🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
He’ll be back for BO1 remastered than I’ll be satisfied got to end it with how u started
Grew up watching you may god bless you with the rest of your path ❤
Why show an Xbox when all competitive cod is on ps? Up until 2021? You messed up there brah.
Ay! It's been a while since our boy hit a million views.
The Parasocial was real with this one. I've never met you Scump, but somehow through all these years of watching you play, I guess a lot of us feel like we have, through all the Optic houses, roster changes, Majors, etc. I will probably never meet you in person, but I felt the need to let you know how much you've helped me and so many millions others through, you'll never know the impact you've had on us, and we will never know the impact this has had on you, but one thing is for certain,  the community will always love and respect you Scump. Looking forward to this last ride. OG
I’m not crying! You’re crying!😢  ScumperJumper4Life #GREENWALL
Weeks later and this shit still has me fucked up. Daam..
This makes me tear up… watching you from a child till now. I’m 24 seeing this. Even when I was just a trickshotter, you were still one of my idols man. Thank you!
thank you scump for many many memorable moments will never forget any of them
😢
🥺🥺🥺
The undisputed G.O.A.T.. In an industry now plagued with streamers using every cheat and hack they can get their sticky hands on, you did it better than all of them, and never sacrificed your integrity. Talent, skill, and dedication were your weapons. You will be missed.
Bro nooo shot😭😭😭
Bro why am I crying
Ho pianto
GG's scump. Legend - you will be missed.
Wow...
i replay this almost everyday and still cry bout it , i wish it didn't have to be like that.....one last rodeo with Crimsix would be lovely. forever love you scump your a GOAT
there goes my childhood  😢
Idc what anyone says I started balling right away. Will miss u man
I cant believe this made me emotional, Lol. I'm not really a fan of Pro cod or Scump either, just aware of them adjacently through eSports. I checked out his announcement and it just made me think about the big picture, how things are about the journey, how one day my kids will have heroes within their respective niche interests and they'll be emotionally removed by their retirement.... There's just something beautiful about a how life is a journey. I'm always so fixated on an end result, often to my detriment, and this was one of those weird, universal interventions that made me have an epiphany on how important it is to just enjoy the ride.  Anyways, lame comment aside, congratulations on a long and amazing career scump, I hope the next step brings you as much joy and success as this past one has.
i do you think you understand how much you meant to us i was 12-14 watching you &nade on black ops 2 and all the trickshotters you guys helped my survive life man fr i’m now 21 and this is my last cod too gotta move on with my life.. love you scump all the best man xxx
dang it you are a huge inspiration to me with attempting to join the team of optic one day which i will be a part of the team one day. you and optic pamaj are my 2 greatest inspirations to wanting to join the team one day. yes i said optic pamaj as he was in optic when he inspired me as well. hope everything goes good for you and when i join optic i wont disappoint you. i will try my best and work my hardest
Glad you finally want to move over to a more casual gaming
Damn seeing that 4 monitor setup, that’s my childhood. Scump the goat!
What a video!! Really touched me in my feels
This was your boy OpTic Scumpii ahhh theea ya💚💚
Im glad u are leaving cz i dont like you
Wow...end of an era... Where did all the time go ?
What’s the song? Anybody know
who is this guy? he seems to be important
I’m 25 now and this made me tear up i’ve been watching you since I was 12 wild
Damn bro… all of the original call of duty ogs are damn near gone
I remember watching you since bo3 you a spectacular gamer 💪!!!
Farewell King…
I personally wanna thank you. Never got into call of duty until I watched you shit on everyone. I hope you make videos on your free time. You are the undertaker of gaming #Legend
damn.... thanks for being my favorite cod player scump. thanks for being alive bro im glad you were a part of my childhood and part of my journey here on this earth. :) <3
This made me cry. We all are adults now and have real lives and families. Nobody realizes how important something is until it’s completely gone. RIP call of duty golden era days.
😢
take care man it was a fun ride regardless <3
Hope other creators leave this shitshow named CoD
You have no idea the positive impact you’ve had on my life since I found optic in 09. One last right brother, thank you for everything! You’re the best that ever did it. The god, I hope nothing but the best for you man
Thank you scump ❤ for everything you did for this community
One last ride, nothing to prove, no pressure, just one last season that you are gifting to yourself to enjoy the competitive call of duty world one last time before you unplug your controller. Remember this season that you are playing to have fun and just feel what it is like to be a pro cod player at the highest level building a career doing what you love. We don't need to say go out and smash it, because we have all already seen you smash it, and become the king of call of duty. So time to have one last fun ride for pure enjoyment and if the lack of pressure and expectation does help you to finish on a great big high then so be it, but it is not required. You already won call of duty. When you unplug that controller you can tell yourself honestly, I completed cod.  I write this comment because I have watched you for what feels like half my life, this is the sport i choose to watch, and you are the main character.
Scump! Thank you for the memories. I remember hours of watching your content growing up. A true humongous impact on alot of people.
You and nadeshot literally are why I continued to play Cod all these years and actually made me a better player through the years
Competitive Cod is dead without dump
Man all good things really do come to an end.
Cringe
Bow down!!!
Love you man been an amazing ride
Jesus reading the comments you literally have a cult following I love you stuff man but Jesus!!
man this makes me sad i deadass grew up watching u
Not everyone’s goat but he was for me idc I loved watching scumpi
im about to cry
Scump 🐐
Let’s go Seth
Good job scump lovely work. you brought so much joy and laughter to the competitive side of call of duty I really hope you enjoyed your career.   Playing call of duty and watching your videos with my mates are some of my most wholesome memories from when I was younger I don’t think I would’ve enjoyed competing in the online tournaments if it wasn’t for you being such a skilled player but also still enjoyed the game and never got too serious your were really a role model for me growing up.   so happy to see how far you have come you deserve everything good that has come your way good luck this year Seth!
THE LEBRON JAMES OF COD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME SCUMP.
Some of the comments you all need to grow up

Wow, time flies. I still remember my wife walking in the room and saying "yo yo yo its ya boi scump here on Nuketown" because she would always hear that phrase when I watched your videos. Lets make it a good season, champ.

Legend 💚
Look at how COD retired my boy
I remember watching him as a teen, we are about the same age. Now he's retiring after a career as a pro cod player. Crazy how the time has passed.  All of us have grown older together
My Comp CoD hero! I love you dude!! Watching you play throughout the years man inspired me, from halo to CoD you truly changed the game indefinitely had a huge impact as well. I watched you in person win your first CoD championship and I did cry lmao. Enjoy retirement my man you deserve it
Been watching you religiously since 2013 and man it has been a wild and entertaining ride. I can't wait to see you shred and dominate your last season.
I've been a fan sense Rambo and seeing  u as the last remaining player.."king scump" the "ginger ninja" it's been a hell of a run #GREENWALL #ONELASTRIDE
“Shanks Mom” 😢
I’m gonna cry
Greetings from Spain de un gran fan desde siempre y para siempre
Legend 💚🤍
Cod's savior and the guy who got me into competitive call of duty over a decade ago when I was in middle school, youre an inspiration to people everywhere Scump. Never been to a cod event but I'm going to a few for sure this last season. Thank you for giving us fans all these special memories, love you Scumpii ! Here's to the future 💚
Grew up watching you slay during the golden days of cod, the optic team during bo2, the dynasty… the moments, the laughs, the scrims, the rages, just everything… I grew up watching your play style, and adapting that to mine and now, the only play style i have and have had is yours. Damn near cried… end of an era… cod will never be same, competitive cod will damn sure never be the same… we love you scump❤😢 thank you for all that you did and showed us.
Apex legends next
What a fucking legend you are. Goosebumps all over the place!
fuck man i don't even know what to say. Such a legit gamer and person man. Started watching you as a teenager, and even on my military deployments we would get internet access for one hour a week, I would spend half of that watching your clips from that week.
You did alot for us Scump, made our childhood. But everything good must come to an end. You will be remembered as a legend. Can't wait till I retire from gaming too oneday and tell my my children and grandchildren about my heroes. Farewell Scump 🍻❤️
Let's go green wall
Best ginger to ever do it
AND SCUMP IS GETTING CROSSMAP KILLA WITH THE SCORPION... goosebumps bruh. Cheers to the King of COD.

Not to be an asshole, but I didn't know who he was until today 😅
CONTROLLER PLAYER AN ENTIRER CAREER OF PLAYING FPS WITHOUT EVEN ACTUALLY AIMING LMAOOOOOO
LOOK AT THE SCOREBOARD!! LOOK AT IT!!!
hard to watch  i guess i never thought we'd grow up  shed tear much love <3
Grateful to have been a young kid growing up playing black ops 1 to the most recent warfare. Millions of stars and galaxies out there but not one can beat the nostalgia we feel when we reminisce on 2010-to present
This gave me good bumps wow 🙏🏻
This was very emotional already from the start of the video gave me goosebumps 💚 Much Love to the GreenWall Let’s get that W for this Championship last time to this end of an Era
Thank you scump for everything
Please don’t go
The nostalgia of this perfectly articulated video 😢🙌👑🤯

I'm going to miss you brother
Holy shit best retirement video ever 😂😂😂 legendary!
u dont know how much u mean to the cod fans. honestly stopped watching cod scenes like 4 years ago but this hits hard. legit makes you tear up.
I’m so fucking old
this legit makes me sad / upset. time flies but didnt think scump would go.
Idk who this guy is?? Did he create a vaccine?? Does he help out the poor??
I member back in the days when I was a young teen watching you now I’m 22 still watching you
Damn, what a wild ride it’s been watching you and the boys grow up and dominate for so many years.
I remember the first time I ever watched Scump play and I learned so much from watching him. My competitive career was nowhere near yours and I’ve been out of the CoD game for awhile, but I’ll never forgot how much you helped me. Thank you for everything, Seth
70 enough said
You’re the goat. 💚
In the words of future “ sensational”
Till you make a comeback like Brady!
So glad i got to see you this year!
cheers
Can not believe it! 😢
You’ve just made me a 26 year old cry I joined call of duty in 2007 and followed optic the most out of all people well done for everything you amazing human
Scumpy this was hard to hear, it feels like the end of an era. I'll never forget the laughs I had watching you or waking up before school and catching the ends of your streams(UK Vs USA time) wish you the best of luck in life and here's to one last year of the king optic scumpy
Lol Modern Warfare 2 is literally such a pile of trash that Scump retired for comp. I love it. Games hot trash fr
this guy deserves honors from Activision and CoD. without Scump, CoD esports wouldnt be half of what it is today
Life sucks these days
Goodbye Scump. I don’t know who you are.
What an honor to watch an historic player grow into the legend he is today You Change Competitive Call of Duty Forever Seth And I speak for EveryOnes Inner Child when I say THANK YOU ❤️‼️
I wonder what he’s gonna do after this?
Thank you king❤
I just don't get why grown men would cry over a gamer retiring smh. That's so weak and sensitive.
MWII so bad Scump retiring smh
Damn. What sucks is that we never know we’re making memories until we remember the nostalgic moments in the future.
Awesome video. The black ops 2 room gave me a nostalgic feeling I haven’t had in so long. Thanks for doing what u do
Used to get through nights at work watching old clips of you play bo2 on youtube lets goo
Ngl, this makes be a bit sad but extremely happy for what's next scump! You're gonna be starting the next chapter in life & all I can say is, may you have live the best life, no mater what it is that's ahead for you. I've been watching you since about mw3/bo2 days💯  that I'll ALWAYS remember. Thank you for everything you've the done for the call of duty competitive scene. You'll go down as of the best that ever done it king🤴 God bless!
shit like this always makes me cry like a bitch
Hero ❤
I just saw my entire childhood flash away here, long live the king !
Ur the goat bro
almost made me cry, takes me back to my childhood
Thank you for all the years and for being apart of my childhood you’ll be truly missed I love you scump:)
The greatest to ever do it
Got me crying on a Monday at work. Will never forget when I saw the first video from you in BO2 days as you dominated with the KSG. I knew instantly I was a fan and boy what a ride it’s been, sad to see it end but excited I’ve been with this ride for so long. Thank you for all the memories Scump
one last ring for the Greatest of all time
👋👋👋❤
The Ginga Ninja 🥷
I’ve been watching since bo2 and you made my childhood I’m 22 now I started watching when I was 12 holy fuck
im so happy to have been here this whole time seen you grow to a goat and all as a kid to a adult thank you scump
Legend
We need a competitive COD beer league for guys like you and Crimsix
Bro you, Nade, Optic, old competitive cod, etc was literally my childhood. Since the end of MW3 beginning of B02 I’ve been watching and when I was younger all I did was play GB’s and UMG’s with my friends idolizing you guys. I spent years watching you guys compete, watching all the backstory in every video. Following all the controversy and things going on when competitive cod was huge. It was times I look back on so fondly and can’t thank you enough for making it what it was!
Crazy how this who I grew up watching like people that’s just now getting into gaming will never know how it used to be the games and friendships you made. FaZe v Optic they will never get to experience greatness it won’t be same without you scump. I used to try to get into lobbies with faze or optic just so I could try to go off and hope I would have a chance to join haha was never realistic too but it was the experience
The King sets down his crown😞🔥 you will forever reign in our hearts
This vid got me so emotional, and i dont typically get emotional... Id imagine im not the only one but for someone who remembers his days in early Cod as the "King" and as somebody who've been watching for a decade and change and looked up to you Scump... This actually got me real emotional, but i understand its the end of an era but im looking forward to see what comes next after! Best of luck to you😭😭😭
one of the guys i looked up to as a kid for gaming man one last ride and im grateful for the entertainment my man apreciate you
wow what a legend thanks
heart broken
😢
Wish I could like it 1000x. You’re the goat man. Can’t wait to see you pop off and give it your all in one last run. My 🐐
man the memories of optic
Making a goodbye video is almost like saying hey im gay
The feels I'm not a optic fan I'm a scump fan watched u religiously since bo2 and have alot loved watching u come in right when u hit the age and just dominate.... GGs scump
Damn the memories watching this, glad to see you living the best life.
Got my play style from you, could never forget. thanks for the years of gaming scumpii.
😢😢😢😢😢
You're Black OPS II FAL Video showing off the trigger fingers back in the day is still one of my favorite videos. Thanks for the memories Scump Good luck to ya!
There is Tom Brady, There is Tiger Woods, and then there Scump. Been watching this guy shred the competition since I was in middle school.
New cod: is about playing slow and not rushing as much Scump:
You need to know how much you made an impact on a lot of our lives. For myself, coming home after a tough day at school and watching your videos was the perfect escape from the shitty parts of growing up. You brought tons of joy to all of us and so I think I speak for everyone when I say, thank you so much you are truly appreciated and have impacted us a whole lot more than you know. ❤
el mejor jugador de call of duty de todos, impresionante lo que fuiste y seras, gracias a ti tuve mi prime en bo2 siendo uno de los mejores de chile.
Game gonna miss u MANE I'm damn sho gone miss you you did COD good
Was recommended this randomly having no idea who you were. I just got into cod last year so I’m pretty new. Though, it seems you’ve had a pretty big positive impact on the community so congrats man, hope this last year is a good one
Aight, cya
Should've gave Lando a better interview
Hes moving too battlefield!!!
Hahaha dude I actually thought he was dropping out of mw2 I felt such sadness but seeing him for a whole.year compete is still amazing.
Idk how many times I got to watch this but man it’s been a ride. Good luck on future endeavors. Another chapter ends and another begins. Look forward to your new content champ
end of an era
Thought this nigga was Lucid
Scump best ever controller player on cod ever will go down as a legend
Today I finally hit the worst day ever. To see my childhood goat retiring made my day 100x better. Been watching you since I was like 7 everyday since then been playing cod tryna be just like you. Idc if I die broke as long as I know I grinded tryna be like you. My GOAT fr.
Dam scum is gone
This video captures so much emotion and the look on Seth’s face shows his satisfaction. The scene where he sat down and the tv changed from halo to the pro set up made me so sad for some reason. Like, they used to be just games, and right behind that is a wild career. Goosebumps.
Is he going to be continuing streaming and is just done competing? Or is he moving on from streaming and being on the internet in general?
never forget the Clip on Jemen
Damn bro it won’t be the same but hopefully you upload more YouTube videos and on cod and competitive games still umgs all the goodies
this is cringe af! its not this serious
End of an era mate, we are getting old now aren't we?
It’s more than a game
I guess Simp is “that guy” now
Video gave me chills. Happy for you and end of an era!
88-0
Damn.   I'm gonna miss this dude man. BO2 WAS ONE MY IMPORTANT MEMORIES

One last ride, let’s make it special Scump. I started watching you for about 11 years ago now, thanks for all the amazing content you’ve brought us and the memories with Optic. 🙏🏼
This isn't about winning the last one now. It's about finally putting that controller up for the last time. Ending a chapter that remained open for a decade. It's been crazy watching close to 10 years of you playing.  Give it your all broski! This one is for the books and for all of our childhoods!
This is art

Love ya Scump, been watching you since 2011. GOAT status forever. I’ll watch you anywhere my friend.
One last ride💚 professional Cod will never be the same, you were the sole reason I watched.
ngl this is sad
I’m a mom who watched you inspire my son he as grew up.  You inspired him in ways a mom just can’t.   Thank you
Who is this
Holy shit, you know we are getting old when scump is retiring. Feels like 08 firing up cod after school
You are a legend a Gladiator You are the best
You the number one streamer
You're the best
this video was beautiful
Scump got me into cod over a decade ago and I still support him to this day even though I don’t play cod much anymore. I only watch competitive cod to see him succeed. One last ride for the king scumperjumper 👑
Been watching you since I was 11-12 bruh I’m 21 now 🥺 where has the time go man makes me so sad knowing that I’m getting older everyday
Wish you all the happiness man, you deserve it.
all it takes to change the course of history... is the will of a single man.” Captain price. You made history in many different ways.
Whatd you say at the end? Can't tell if that was sike or what lmao
i know you are a real og mans put HALO 2 on the screen...... the true MLG goat... ahhh the good ole days
why am I crying right now, the feels
This hurts 💔💔
I CRIED
Man.. I've seen some insane people in my life, be it gaming, music, drifting, or other things, but Scump.. You were a huge part of me growing up and playing CoD. It's crazy to think that I started watching you back in BO2 days, and that time just flew past.. Now you're retiring.. where did all that time go? The CDL will never be the same without you brother. Let's make this last year a year to remember. A year for the history books. We love ya Seth.
Thank you so much for all the inspiration and memories, forever a GOAT!!!💜
seriourly i watch u since black ops 2 and i cant imagine how this happend
You'll be missed. One of the very best players to ever do it.
Him and nadeshot are and will always be legends
Seeing scump in mw3 days was gold time has passed too fast
That begining was sick
No words except to say... Thank you, Scump. You will ALWAYS be the King.
Goat thanks for good memories
I don’t know you but ok
I did not expect to cry today. It feels like it was just yesterday that I was watching Scump play alongside Nadeshot.
You’ve been an idol to me scumpii. The best cod player this world will ever see. Good luck champ!
😭😭
Bro, God Sees you💜
i feel old now that i see this respect at u scump u was the best of all time
Anyone smart will walk away from COD, it's changing and it's not for us anymore boys.
Damn Im getting old 😅
❤
I remember staying up watching all your mw3 & bo2 videos, a true cod 🐐🐐
The cinematography 🔥👌
Wow man grew up watching you slay on black ops 2 and 3 I would wait till you came on 3 and watch you every time. You’re one of the greatest players to ever do it, enjoy retirement my guy
You inspired many including myself. thank you scump it's been a pleasure.
Scump will either become a Coach or he's moving on to other businesses.
Scump's left a legacy of joy and laughter for years, he's killed verified cheaters on tournaments time and time again, he's brightened the day through clip after clip, he's ("imo") not up there but near about Jev as far as I am concerned. Content is key, but loving your audience is everything. Creators come and go but the ones who stick around are the ones who stay in your heart. The reminder of better days, simpler days. I wish your retirement well brother. PS: AAAAAND hope you keep producing content, but play whatever YOU want to play. God bless brother, thanks for the memories.
So excited to support you through the rest of your career, brother! I'm sure you've got big things planned. Til then, one more championship!
This is like my childhood ending, it’s really time
Well now I’m sad
Been watching you since you were in highschool… the number of hours watching you and Nadeshot and the MLG Bo2 tournaments… the number of people you inspired to be video game content creators is incredible… I don’t think most people understand or appreciate the level of impact you had on what’s become e-Sports… so for that, I thank you! Green Wall!
so cinematic
love you forever scump!!!!
My favorite guy of all time dude no way 😢
Can’t take the bs with these new cods anymore.
Who is this?
Forever and always the King of Bo2 and Optic👑
Man you were my childhood. I was tearing up this entire half of the video.
Epic video bro....congratulations on an epic career.
Retire while up. You changed the game homie. Mad respect
GOOSEBUMPS
why am I crying
ok but youll still be streaming right?
Thank you Seth.
I love this video so much. It shows the love for the game, the stress in competing, where he came from, him taking a seat then watching his team. Absolute god like video
Never heard of you but peace cuh
grew up watching you scump, you'll be forever a legend to a lot of people.
Thank you 💚
It was a pleasure watching you dominate all these years 🔥 no one will ever match what you’ve done champ ❤️
Im starting to think scump can be a silent protagonist in a movie or tv show. 😮😮😮
Here since 2014 and will be by your side till the end, scump you were and always will be a beast homie in all regards, God bless and good luck on everything coming <3
bye lol
I still remember running into scump on bo2. He shredded my team. It feels like it was just a few months ago. Knowing all those live gameplay commentaries and how hungry he was at the tournaments will no longer exist is heart breaking
i'll never forget watching you fuck it up on bo2. There was something about the energy from the videos that had me clicking on them every time they popped up. All good things come to an end, your mark on the competitive cod world and the content world will never be forgotten. <3
You're an inspiration to us all Seth. You have no idea how much you have influenced me!
Forever be a COD legend
Good luck
Thank you for making us all believe we can be more than just gamers, my childhood thanks you🙏🏼🙌🏼
seth makin me tear up out here
This dude showed up on my feed thinking he important or something 💀
Wonder what he will go on to do now?
I remember watching you when you use to play bo2 bro. I really wish you well man. Thats for the great content and gameplays and just thanks for making my bo2 experience the best that it was back in the day!! Hope you have a great life. Love from South Africa!!
When halo 2 came up😢😢😢
Dominated competitive COD for more the 2 console gens!!!
OMG!!!!!! This is so crazy!!!
Fck legend 🤙
Love you scump. Thanks for all you've done for the game and for professional call of duty.💚
the mf 🐐🐐🐐
Bout time ✌️
Looks like a Nike commercial for Gaming 🔥🔥this is dope and been a fan for over 15 years
Comp. Cod won’t ever be the same brother.
I haven’t watched cod in years. This came on my timeline and I’m dead. I watched you all the way up until Cold War. All the tournaments, I watched them all. You were my childhood. Found you during MW3 and fell in love. I wish you peace and happiness from here on out my man, theeya
You're a savage and I don't think anyone will ever get it like you do my friend been studying your style and finesse in cod for 8 years now makes me play a lot better so thank you for that!!!🙏
The dude who got me into call of duty at 12 years old. Legend to say the least.
Glad that I could grow up in the same era and experience the likes of you, nade, H3cz, and kr3w. And experience the same games.   def cannot forget UMG Chicago 2013. That was epic to see.   Appreciate your game play and contributions to the Competitive community.
God not a optic guy but this makes me sad scumpy is a goat. Definitely won’t be the same without scump 😭😭
Why was this video emotional 😂
Scumps last year? It’s been 5 years since I picked up a call of duty because of the military but now ima make sure to grind this cod like no other bc this will truly be the end of an era.
You are Call of Duty 💚
😭
Finally scum is stopping
gg
End of an era
this brought a tear to my eye.
yeah COD is for kids, well done making it to adulthood, see you on dayz?
We are gonna miss you man! One last match and the best goodbye to a Legend! 😎🤟
Holy shit .. the hours I’ve spent watching your legendary videos! From time to time I go back and watch some of the bo2 ones. Thank you for some amazing years, especially the bo2 days, those very something else! Much love from a 27 year old fan from Denmark ❤️
That was so so hard
Goat. End of an era
Never heard this guy before, but his video did popped in my notification as recommended. I never felt sad just watching a video like this, forgive me for I am weak, love and God bless you.
This man is the LeBron James of call of duty eSports, he truly is special man. He got me started on loving competitive gaming and optic is my all time favorite gaming team. Faze was another team I loved but for entertainment purposes while optic is my favorite competitively. This man made such high level reads and plays, never shied away from a challenge. It makes me feel old to see him retiring, so old....I'm 20 yet I feel 40 seeing this legend finally put his crown down on his throne and move on to the next phase in his life. Scump we truly love watching you play, you inspire many others even pros. The king! 👑👑👑👑
This one hits really hard remembering all the memories I was only 10 when I started watching you now I am 23. I’m proud and happy  of how far you’ve gotten I will never forget you optic scump
I love you bro
Ima miss you kid🙌
You have no idea how you have made the COD industry great. I remember the first time seeing you play and it was great. You will be missed!
One of the saddest moments in cod history…. Made my child hood growing up
I hate that I'm getting this 6 days later, we know this dude with still stream, but we will miss you in the competitive scene man
Never have i wished for it to be april fools day more than today..
the king is dead so long live the king
Huge respect to you ginger ninja!
I think a part of me just died. I loved watching you play dude, you were always so fire and played a big part in the player I am today, you literally got me into Call of Duty and watching you play made me a better player. Thanks for all the memories man.
My man turn fun  into a career  sad to see you go my dude
Legend of the entire fps genre ❤️💚
How will the comp look this year when it’s a two year cod?
Who the hell is this guy nd why’s he on my feed 😂
this shi gave me goosebumps man :(
i love you scump. thanks for making the hard days better family❤️thank you for an amazing era of gaming. you’ll always be the goat in my eyes
Man I’ve watched Scump since I was 19 when he did his old dubstep videos. I’m in my 30s now retired myself from the gaming community. Sad to see him go but like anything all great things must come to an end at some point. The end of a legendary era gents
Goosebumps. I will miss you
Bruh.....take care.....good game yo
This was better than any recent marvel movie
😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔 my childhood is officially over 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
simply put. The goat.
Word to the copy of Mx vs Atv Unleashed 🐐
Last time i saw a video of you was like 10-12years ago time passes fast
Why are you quitting it’s a video game keep milking it and making money it’s not like you can do much else with yourself
Say it ain’t so
Dammmmmb bro I been watching Scump and Nadeshot since I was a jit. It hurt back when nadeshot stepped away but this hits completely different. Scump I always came to your vids to improve myself, from black ops 2  days to now. Thank you for your hustle Man, your the goat 🐐
the best to ever do it 📌
Thank you for all the great memories, I remember getting home from school and immediately starting up one of your videos and wanting to be good at video games. Take care scumperjumper
Man I loved your content growing up man I hope you find your new wave my friend good luck to you ❤️🦾
Scumper jumper the something pumper 😂🤣 man, only got into watching pro COD because my buddy showed me OPTIC and for some reason, I really liked you. This is when you first joined as well and I was like dude, this guy is an actual GOAT. And you always will be! The next chapter in your life will be dope! Not only were you great at COD but you had a really fun/funny personality
😭
Can you blame him? He’s been doing it for awhile for sure. But the games have been ass since Modern Warfare 2019 came out.
Goosebumps <3 All the best u fucking Legend
And just like that nobody cares.
GG scump
I will miss competitive scumpy
Excited for this year since it’s Scumps last dance. They have the roster to go all the way no questions asked. It’s just about being consistent and avoiding injuries like last year. Sad to see since Scump got me into cod. Crazy to see how time flies. Makes me feel old 😂😂
I haven't watched Scump in maybe 6 or so years since I've found less and less enjoyment in CoD personally. But Scumpy my man... I hope the next chapter in your life is as fulfilling as competitive CoD has been. Won't lie I loved watching your matches
Damn Scump, all good things must come to an end. The impact you had on young/old gamers doing what you do best, sweatbannin, clappin compet cheeks. I'll miss you bro, we all will. What an illustrious career you have had and what an amazing collection of memories you've given us all, we will treasure these for years to come.  Thank You Scump, From all your supporters 💚
What an atmosphere this video created, damn!
Let’s make this year count brotha
🫡
You better feed them if it your last year, leave with a impression love from Australia 💪💪
This gave me flashbacks to my days of competitive CoD when I enjoyed the game. Optic was my team i rooted for and scump was there day in and day out being one of the best. A scump fan since Black Ops 1 when he was Levitate or something like that in red I don’t remember the name off the top of my head. Gonna have to watch his final tournament journey matches to pay respects to my favorite call of duty player of all time.
Damn.
Thanks for everything Scump ✌🏻🫡
I cried watching this :( Luv u Scump
GGs my bro. LFG 🤙🏽🍻
Dramatic
I learned so much about msgs from you man. How to use em better an play better since I first started watching you play w/ bo3. Good luck on the rest of your journey.
Let's end it with a bang, Thanks again Seth for everything and I cannot wait for the 2nd arc, The new era that comes after this long story 💚
Thank you Seth, for everything

It was about time honestly it’s time to pass the mantle and be something more to grow somewhere else because look at nadeshot he left competitive call of duty and look how he’s striving .
I'll be here when you come out of retirement . I will meet you one day and I thank you for always being there for others and those oddball who had nothing but you to cheer us up. Thank you scump. My hero

Bo2, I was like 4-7, watching you play while I was playing, trying to copy your style, your classes, emblem, closest I could get to your name, everything. It was the best time of my entire life. Thank you Scumpii, I will miss you in competitive cod. You were my idol and still are. Hope to see what life has in store for you along the road💚
See ya ginge
💔
Scum carried call of duty for so long.. he kept me motivated to play bo2 as I was continuously getting shredded until I used his mp7 class… I’ll never forget the memories of a depressed teenage me watching you and nade lock tf in and win tournaments and championships.. you helped me more than I can ever Tell you man! And I hope one day I can meet you. Thank you Seth “scumpy”

Bro this is the first thing I see when I open YouTube today... the man who essentially raised me on early/mid 2000s COD, who I watched without fail when he posted an never missed a beat. As sad it is to see you go from and put a end to this Era, may you enjoy the road ahead and may greater things come for you still brother ! It's been a ride and a blessing all the most to watch you over the years ! 🤍 #TheKingScumpyForever #bestinthefuckingame!

He pushed me to get better back in the bo2 days. It’s making me hella sad seeing how much time has passed. Thanks for the memories you helped me make Seth🤍
This gave me cold chills all the way through the first 30 seconds was pure nostalgia
Child hood YouTuber, it was a good ride man 👍 good luck !

Why does it feel like my childhood is starting to die away so early...... I remember the MLG days with the immense rivalry between Optic and (OG) FaZe. I remember Scump destroying on MW3. Bye Scumpii...
Holy shit. 😢
Noooo!!!!!!
watching you has always been a light through the darkest of times. thank you for all you've done for the sport and for me.
End of an Era for sure. Cannot wait to see what's next though! Make the one last ride a blast!
Legend in the game. Ik have so much memories watching him. He and the optic team made my childhood.
I have no idea who this guy is, everyone's acting like he's a big idol
Gingers have no souls
Good riddance. This for sure is Optics's year.
One last ride and you'll definitely be missed from the pro scene
Its life, we grow up and move on to greater things. Hard part is always letting go.
We do not care
You have made a legendary impact on COD. <3 <3 <3
Gunna go watch every bo2 video now
One king does not reign forever.
Just letting you know, in all it’s insignificance, you and a couple others carried my childhood into my teeenagw years. love you bro and hope you discover and cultivate what matters to you in life. Even tho you don’t know me, you helped me grow into the person I am today and it means and has meant a lot to me.  I’ll be there watching you in the last stages of your competitive career, maybe, can’t tell Bc life is doing a number on me atm, but I’ll try as it means a lot to me. Probably don’t care or are too busy but I just want to let you know, if anything, you helped me to enjoy my life and grow into the person I am I today. Thanks scumper
I’m not crying, you’re crying😢
We'll miss you scump. You are the reason why I wanted to start playing Cod.

Makes sense , why would the goat want to keep playing when Activision has destroyed COD allowing streamers to not only cheat but protected to cheat in tourneys
This sucks
😢 bro fuck I’m not crying

I’m not even into cod anymore like that but seeing a piece of my middle school memories having time tick on them as it does all is.. reflecting.. be blessed on your journey
Made me tear up 🥲
goosebumps are real rn holy
All these years have been one hell of a ride Scump. Watched you since the early days when you were first getting started streaming. You had an amazing career and the game won’t be the same without ya. Congrats on everything you accomplished over the years and good luck to you with everything life brings you in the time to come. Thanks for the memories!
a thsee ya
goes to val
I watched you so heavy during bo3 and waited for every upload. It feels weird seeing my favorite pro player retire

I haven’t watched you as much in my older years, but growing up watching YouTube you have always been my favorite cod champ, ur amazing energy and an amazing person, ur doing amazing as Uno, proud of u as r so many of us✌🏼❤️➕
You're truly the reason I got into playing cod. Watched you from the beginning. Will never forget the hype whenever you were popping off. Love you, Scump. Always humble right up to the end. Well deserved. 💚
I mean…thought he left years ago already. Plus it’s CoD…you die so fast anyways, at what point is “skill” just not a factor? Not hating, but we gotta be realistic.
oh nooo! anyway...
An absolute legend. One of the pillars to my childhood. Congratulations Scump
I’m crying so hard rn 💔
1:40 hit me heavy
BO2 scump will always be my goat
enjoyed watching you over the years Scump! Been a hell of a journey man, congrats on all the success and best of luck King Scump!

88-0 sweatbannin
Goodby scump
Damn sethy
I’m not crying you are Edit: Okay I’m crying
My favorite COD professional player, BY FAR, from the BO2 days to even the ghost days when you joined Envy. It was an amazing run and an even more amazing journey getting to grow up with you. You’ve done this game wonders and us, fans, wonders. We appreciate everything you’ve done. Thank you Scumpii ❤
Was a good era
Black ops 2, grew up with you and nade. You'll be missed mate. Make it worth enjoy the time ❤
Why was this on my recommendation
I was really into watching your bo3 vids my guy. Much love here
Should have added the BO2 "Im the best in the game audio"
Crying my eyes out tbh
Nah this shit made me sad fr
What's up guys boeh here
Shit made me tear up.. was like a time warp crazy to think I was able to witness it all. So many good times
Production of the video is phenomenal. I don’t keep up with CoD as much as I used to but growing up watching OpTic this was pretty emotional.
Where did all the time go😢
The King may leave his throne but he’ll always carry the crown in the hearts of the people.   This video was a masterpiece. It was those foldable tables that got me tearing up.
Scump is definitely a Legend, but Optic employing cheaters they are a joke
Was an honour to watch you play for so many years!
Back in Black Ops 2. My friend and I were playing Dom on turbine. And Seth was on the other team absolutely shitting on the entire lobby. He ended up going 160 kills and like 8 deaths or something. Anywho my friend and I were trying to kill him but we literally couldn't he was too good. And we weren't bad players lol he was just a different Breed. After that match, I had said "wow he really is THAT good" I'll never forget that. Gg's Seth. You're one of the greatest to ever do it in CoD and you were a call of duty icon growing up ❤
I remember you bo2 vids gonna miss you
Bro that was the coolest video ever ...did I hear a nade reference?
My childhood fr bro. End of an era
This was really darn moving 😢
Shit 10 years of scump, huge part of my childhood let’s go Seth love you bro
im not crying you are
The King!
Well.....bye
Yo chill scump it ain’t even April fools  Bro u was the top number one call of duty isn’t the same without the hype beast Scumpy you will forever be remembered and missed fr
Bro this was hard af
🐐😪
Legends never die,happy retirement King Scump !
Love U man Never Will Be the Same
❤
Even tho i stopped supporting you long time ago & lost interest in competetive cod (because cod is dead), you was a role model & the face of cod e-sports & the reason we all started. A true goat
#opticgoat
I don't know who this guy is nor do I watch competitive gaming, but I was recommended the video. The quality and creativity made me give a like anyways. Congrats on a cool career!
The bo2 pub and comp stomper 88-0 flawless… End of an era
The saddest thing I have seen today! been watching since BO2 days. one of the best slayers of the game. I didn't think this day would ever come..  scump the legend has finally left the building.! OG's top player since day 1! we will miss you Scump! give us 1 more 75 kill TDM. we know you can do it!
The goat of COD competitive loved watching optic when i was younger just watching scump pull off plays i wish i could itll be sad the day you retire 🤝 thank you for the years of insane plays
Can I have your gaming chair
This is one of the greatest videos I have ever watched. Insane to think I have watched you play since the beginning, and it is all now coming to an end. A Pro Gamer who will go down in history!
Wow, this video just wow. Especially when the OG Optic 2013 house setup lid up, wow.
this shit gave me goosebumps, thanks for the videos over the years and thankful for all the gamers you created out there, thanks for everything, we appreciate it scump
thank you for everything 💚
This hit different. You the goat Scumpi.
Enjoy your life now
I'm not crying, you are!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Who watches competitive cod anyways I watched this man for his pub stomps 😂 but regular multiplayer doesn’t hit the same now that BR is here

we going to miss you man , I grew up watching you and I loved every moment of it. wish you all the best in this life. ❤
Only difference between you and I is that you got your kill streaks
This cod is realy good ...i love it
This made me sad... The mom talking in the background with the OG Xbox. Jesus Christ... Made me tear up.
Love you man. Can’t wait.
Legend!!!
Bro I literally started tearing up when you walked over to the old couch/TV with Halo 2 on it. So many memories watching you over the years bro. Love ya man. 💚
Scump went to federal prison😢
Greatest of all time. Seth you’re the legend we all wanted to be on the sticks
G.O.A.T of Cod
That’s the goat
Cod will never be the same without you scump #greenwall💚
I remember you were some kid prodigy back in the MW2 days and now you’re retiring. Crazy bro.   Hope to see you do one more run with Treyarch’s game in 2024. I understand you don’t wanna subject yourself to multiple years of MWII lol
I speak for all the OGs when I say those was an emotional video RIP TO COMPETITIVE CALL OF DUTY 😢
the one who started my competitiveness in gaming, much love for everything you did for us all g ❤️
Scump is WITHOUT Question the GOAT of COD. He's the king. It's not like there's even room for debate like in other eSports or sports. Scump is clearly the GOAT. He's the player everyone remembers, even those who don't really follow cod. What a run he has had. Congrats Scumpi, you are on top and as I see it, the best cod player to have ever lived.
Kind of over dramatic for a young man announcing his retirement
I think it’s the perfect end to the story, with it being mw2 and with you being engaged, congratulations on life scump
The King 👑
Smhhh if he was black no one would care 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿😡😡😡😡😡 BLM!!!
Frfr gonna miss you bro. I remember when I first watched you it was one of your bo2 nuclears that you’d always get. It didn’t matter what gun you just got a nuclear and that’s sick. May I wish you nothing but success and I’m thankful that I got to grow up watching you🥹🫶🏽😭😭😭
Te quiero scumpii
i dont even watch pro COD anymore but scump been a pro since back when i first learned girls get horny to. Go forth nd prosper king
Legends never die, nor forgotten brother! Your best of the best and always will be!! No other legend like the scump and dump or scumpii! Cod won’t be the same no more now, just like baseball when Jeter walked away… Congratulations scump for all you’ve accomplished I super appreciate all you’ve done for cod community! Again wasn’t for guys like you call of duty would of died off along time ago! Will miss you brother! Thanks scumpii for all the great memories!
Crazy man, my entire childhood was you and Nade.
the best to ever touch the game
Damn this is upsetting
this makes me wanna play cod again. love you scump
Hits home. was a fan since BO3 days!!! All the best and God bless 🙏🏽
fuck man this kinda brought a tear to my eye. Much love to you Seth !!
The only amazing player that doesn't hack
Cringe
RIP SCUMP YOU WAS MY IDOL MY IDOL!!!
i love u bro
pro cod player
Why though? Jeez, acting like your mother passed away or something, it's just a game, play it or don't, you don't have to play it competitively, just play normal ranked match's or something, lol
I have been following you since I was 111 years old… I am 22 now… thank you so much for everything scump you help me become who I am today
You were my inspiration source
I can't even tell you how emotional this made me. Been watching you for a long time. It's crazy.
You made my childhood bro loved black ops 3 cause of you scump this shit hurt i aint gon lie
If Tom Brady can come back Scump can too.
I hope the next chapter in you life offers you the support and success you have earned Seth. Been watching you for years and you truly are a cod hall of famer in my book. Best of luck this season brother and all the luck in the wold for whatever come next.
man is equivalent to kobe bryant 🥹 gone from the league but never forgotten growing up watching optic
Legend!
The real question is what are you going to be playing competitively because you only said this will be my last year playing cod competitively….. sooooo👀
Bro this video made me tear up cause you inspired me to play cod overall. And made me fall in love with the esports community overall. And the way this video was edited the nostalgia hit hard.   ONE LAST RIDE !!!!
Scump, I watched your vids growing up and attended a few events in 2013-2014 and was always cheerin for ya!  I hope you play this last year to your fullest and enjoy retirement friend!
I remember the first time I started to watch you and nadeshot was some of my best memories as a kid, you guys got me into gaming, Stay up have a good life dude you'll be missed. I look forward to seeing some content from you this year!
It’s crazy cause when normal people retire they play video games and go on vacations, when a gamer retires it’s to spend time with there family and step away from the gaming realm goodbye scump :(
Whoever directed the vid it came out fire!!
Missing the bo2 days
Congratulations on your retirement call of duty hasn't been the same for me since BO4 I cant blame ya it's not the same game anymore
"I'M VIGILANT" - Scump  I love you, man. We love you....
There is nothing 'professional' about cheating to win WSOW Solos 2021!!!
later nerd❤️
This man literally made my childhood, I'm so sad. I'm happy he has grown up and done what he aspired to do. From when I was 8 to now 18, thank you Scump.
Why can’t cod be like before man
What If I’m not ready for you to give it up 🥺🥺. Love you Scump, thanks for making my childhood that much better. 💚
This better one one hell of a year for  scumpy with a dumpy cheering for you till the very end!❤
Im not crying you are crying     NO WE ARE ALL CRYING !!    We love you Seth❤ !
Time to grow up I guess
almost shed a tear. the old days are something we can never get back, but we’ll also never forget
What happened? What did I miss? I haven't watched him for months but I got sad he's leaving :(
Cod is so terrible that scump is retiring lmao
When i think of the most legendary competitive cod player in history i think of scump. Competetive cod will never be the same
I'm not crying.. you are.. gonna miss you OG💯
So sad 😞
Sniff..sniff....uuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaahh...UUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÀAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.......sniff sniff
This gave me goosebumps
Even though I am not an optic fan it was amazing to watch you throughout the years this is the end of an era but also a new beginning good luck scump
Imagine, leaving the competitive cod scene just to switch to a game, like league of legends
thanks bro!
cya nerd
I love gaming but I don't watch pro gamers because I enjoy the act of playing the games personally but this video was so sick! Fantastic job dude and congrats on your career!
scump 4L <3
Holy hell man this is actually a bit depressing but all good things must come to an end. I didnt watch you alot cuz i was dookie in cod and still am, but watching you kept making me wanna play and the fact that im 22 now is like so insane. You deserve this retirement and cant wait for the next steps you take
“Professional cod player” maybe was hinting at halo since the TV showed that ? 👀
A video that was supposed to be your journey looked more like my child hood and earlier years of gaming. Thanks scump.
You know ur getting old when scump retires
Helluva Edit 🔥
The for real made me cry, I’ll hold onto the memories till I die
Love you scump. Times is changing but only for the best
Duder is 27 ya'll. He's not going anywhere.
Thanks for making my childhood great ! 😢🎉❤
This video hits me very hard. I can’t believe I’ve followed your path for 10 years. For so many of us you were the light we needed on a stormy day, we would watch your videos and forget about the pain we had. This reminds me of my 20s, the people I met, the memories I shared with so many over that era. Some you lose touch with forever, but in times you needed a friend, you and bo2 were there for so many of us! Thank you to you, and everyone I shared a laugh, interaction with. 🙏🏽 God bless y’all
Sick video we love u scump
Oh thank god I thought it was over now
GOAT
thank you scump ❤
The greatest to ever touch the game of Call of Duty
This shit threw me back to being a kid watching scump
I love the halo 1 n 2 …. HELL yea
I caught the chills when u said that, but I hope you continue to make content and call of duty videos and gameplays.
Of all the things one could get emotional on, I'd never think this is what would get goosebumps and actual tears from me. This makes me realize how watching Seth play back in the day has made such an impact in my life, even though I haven't been keeping up with his career for a few years now. I will be definitely watching him close next year though... gotta appreciate the legend he is, one last time.
Grew up watching you! One of the optic goats 🐐
We’re witnessing a legend in the making. What an honor.
We’re witnessing a legend in the making. What an honor.
You’ve always been my favorite cod pro. You have been a true inspiration! May god bless you for the rest of your days 🙏
All legends gotta hang up the jersey at some point, take care!
Wow Scumpii, what a legendary run you've had my friend! I haven't been around the whole time but ever since BO2 I've been an avid viewer.Thankyou for your dedication Seth 🙏 you will be going down as one of the greats
this made a grown man cry
Some of us wouldn't have survived our childhood without you Seth. You'll be forever remembered. Your a goat THE GOAT. Thank you for everything good luck with the next chapter of your life 💪💙
I’m going to front flip off my balcony now see ya 😢
You were, and always will be part of our childhoods. I’ll never forget all the tactics you and your teammates taught me
The best there was, the best there is and the best will be in COD. 😢
You made my childhood even better, every video, every "yo yo yo"... It will ring out for eternity. True Legend.
King Scump Checking Out.. Crazy How Fast Time Moves You’ll Be Missed King !!
Never was really into competitive cod but you made waves in the scene that it was impossible to not notice. Nothing but beautiful pub stomping from here on out.
the king
Watched this over and over and still gets me everytime. Idk why honestly, when era's come to an end it just hits harder I guess. Good luck this season and good luck with whatever is next Seth!!
Goodbye from Brasil 🇧🇷 Thank you Scump!
Scump is getting cross map kills with the Scorpion!!!
So long brother. We all salute you 🫡🖤 thank you for everything
This made me cry...my childhood Pro
I competed at mid level during bo2, ghosts and AW. Won a few lans in the uk, scrimmed regularly with Uk pros like Swanny, Jurd and Tommey. But the moment that sticks out in my mind and has never left me is being invited to 8’s with the boys I mentioned above and some US pros on Ghosts. Scump was amongst the US pros in this 8’s lobby. I was so nervous and overwhelmed with joy that I couldn’t speak. Finally in the post game lobby Scump piped up and said “Pug?” (The name I used to go by), I was stunned and mumbled “uh huh” and goes “nice job holding down B”. I said “thanks man” and nothing else, I was just stunned to even be speaking to someone I’d looked up to since Black ops 1. So seeing this video gave brought a lot of sadness but also a warm feeling, no COD pro is more deserving of the success than this man. A shining example to the community and those outside our world that doubt us and look down upon esports.
Straight chills dawg😢
He’s gone thanks to Activision doing a horrible job
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
ive waited years for u to say these words
finally someone who actually needs a break ..lol
poor baby has to give up playing video games and finally grow up LMFAO you beta
Heart broken
I remember the very beginning. Crazy how its all flown by like that. Wish you the best my dude!
The best in cod history 🫡🙌🏼 no cap 🧢
Man, cod will never be the same, nothing but straight cheaters

Man I’m gonna miss competitive Seth. Like a lot of people, I started watching competitive cod because of scumpii and it’s not going to feel the same without him. But I’m so glad I was here for the rise of the King 👑 and I can’t wait to see what he does next. Thank you, Optic Scumpii for the years of thrilling competition on the main stage.
Thank you for all the happy moments you gave us scump, you are a legend
It will be an honor to accompany you in your last dance
I cried
End of an era
Your fan base never went away.. we all grew older bro but we never forget. As did you. You will not be forgotten. I remember running into you briefly in an SND match on Bo2.. You made it bro

Hope you further your career with the biggest smile; get you some rings to wear through that too fucking Tom Brady of COD pro league

Long live the king!

Anybody else just get chills?

Hope you have a good one man. 💜
Feels crazy how much times passed I feel old af now just turned 27 haven’t played competitive cod for a few years as you get older got to prioritize your life -_- I still come check you’re content out every 6-12 months it’s crazy to see you’re actually leaving. You’re the show bro hopefully you stay involved on the sidelines in some way it’d be a shame to not see you around anymore. Anyways I started watching you play Mw3 when that first came out and thank you bro your content was always the first thing I’d watch. So much passion ! That’s what the community will miss bro. ✌️ good luck in life and this season
I remember being a freshman in high school watching g you smash on kids man crazy to think you're calling in your last compie streaks this year bro, thank you for being you, you've inspired allot of people scump, you'll forever be missed in the gaming community.
This shit gave me chills
Even when I do understand is hard to let you go during ups and downs you was my guy thanks for all the moments you gave us what a legendary career let’s finish strong Sethy
Gunna cry when his contract ends 🥺 why you gotta leave me like this man :(
Don’t do this to me bro tell hector to make u a partner a trainer don’t hop over the green wall
It's cause the new COD's are 🗑 hu lol.
Truly the GOAT. Thank you, Seth, for all you've done for the game. You will forever be my favorite. Good luck in the next chapter of your life! Thank you for all the memories and inspiring me. Love you dude
Not watched eSports in years but for about 3/4 years I was big into it, many memories of Scump in "the good old days" of COD. Long live the king 👑
Thank you dude <3

Bruh made me wanna cry

Seth I remember meeting you at the EGL9 event in Blackpool Norbreck Castle, I will never forget how much I idolised you, and how I still idolise you today. I love you to bits man ❤️ I can't imagine a gaming event without you in it :(
I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING! 😭😭😭
Damn scump
I almost cried man that was good
Damn sad to see a legend leave I remember watching you play League Play, and quick scope dropping over 80kills on BO2. Been watching you since highschool crazy how time flys but probably off to bigger and better things much love and respect champ 💪🏾
Love u scumpii, thanks for everything ♥️
Thank you for being the main source of entertainment for me while I was growing up and playing cod.
WHOS THE BEST IN THE GAMEEEEEEE
what a video, what a message, only goosebumps for me and for those who, like me, can't imagine a competitive cod world without you
I almost cried😂
I’ve watched you for as long as I can remember. Probably close to the beginning of your career and don’t know that I’ve ever commented on a video, but this was beautiful. Even brought back some great memories of mine. I’ve loved watching you compete and I hope you continue to produce content. Thanks for the memories and good luck this year!
Video was 🔥🔥💯👏🏽👏🏽
damn really can’t explain how sad this makes me
😭❤️
Thank You for all the good memories, COD will never be the same with out SCUMPY!!!
GOAT!!! Thank you for showing us the ways. The community will never be the same without you.
Never fully kept up with competitive cod but this hurts even me. I'm happy for scump doing what he wants to do but it's sad we lose probably the greatest cod player in history
Win it ALLLL!
Almost makes you sad to grow up…
This is so fucking sad
Why though lol.
Bro You Legend 😮‍💨Thank You For Making Everyone’s Childhood Better! Wish You The Best On Your Next Journey Thru Life Brudda
broken hearted
Just as cod mw 2 was reminding me a little of bo2, I see this video lol.
Wow
I remember hearing this kids voice in the background everyday while my little brother was on YouTube. I finally took the chance to stop and watch him play. That was nearly 10 years ago. Scump, nade, and optic are the soul reason why I started taking online gaming serious. They forever made me a loyal fan to not only optic but to call of duty as well. It’s been a fun ride and I never would of thought some kid saying yo yo yo would turn into this long journey as it has.
Yo yo yo it’s ya boi optic back at it again with another black ops 2 video gonna be using the Scar
Can you blame him with cod never being the same again as the classics it must be real repetitive having to play these dogshit games  sure the new cods have insane graphics and movement but it lacks what the older cods had 🥺
Finna make me cry…
God damn that hurt right in the feels
why the hell do i always think i know these people...
LETS GO SCUMP
Chills.  Cheers to a generational talent, and cheers to your next endeavor
GGs
man :(
holy shit man giving me goosebumps
Make it a good one Scump, been quietly following your career over the years and to me you will always be "THE BEST IN THE GAME!!" peace.
The Goat! Watched so many of these tournaments live as a kid and to think I’m the age of scump when he really started competing it’s crazy! Optic gaming will be remembered by what scump has done! T2P 1 last time💚🖤
Been watching you since bo2 days you’ll be missed man
honestly cod comp will die now
The last dance.. this shit gonna be on ESPN in 10 years.  All hail the king!
A true GOAT, legend of the game you will always be missed

Thank you for everything. You changed my life forever.
Love you Scump! Been watching you for so long that I feel like I grew up with you lol. You’ve been a staple for an entire generation of gamers and I’m excited to see where you go next 🖤

I’m going to comment because I really did like watching you play when I was growing up. I’m 29 now with a kid and family. The time goes by quickly but we always have all the amazing content. This comment isn’t much but thanks for the content brother. You are awesome and I know you’ll find success in everything you do. Damn now I’m also slightly depressed lol.

I learned a lot from watching him he may not know how many ppl he impacted by just playing COD he has changed the game and probably is one of the reason there are so many COD PLAYERS TO THIS DAY ❤❤❤ I WILL MISS YOU BROTHER  (to me you is the face of COD )
Damn man you know your getting old when one of your favorite COD players is retiring . I remember when these dudes were lifting back in the old optic house with flamesword and the homies. 😢
The old era of COD is officially over
What a legend I’m glad I caught this and can support the goat one last time 🔥
prolly the first person that comes to mind when think of call of duty / youtube / bo2 / CDL / optic
Legend 💚
Why are you leaving?
Scump will forever be a legend
I remember how many times you single hand carried your entire team countless times. I grinded so hard everyday to try to be as good as you. Thank you for making my childhood the best possible one it could be #SCUMPYFOREVER
Man I remember when you where the best man the scene will forever miss you bro..
I never followed competitive COD even though I extensively played since Mohaa up to OG MW2. I had to appreciate and respect this.
The legendary slayer
You inspired millions man love ya❤
Love you scump thank you for everything
On the edge of retirement and you’ll still be one of the top 3 smgs this season.  Long live the king!   Thank you Scumpi ❤ my children will watch your videos one day.
OMG Where did the Time Go 😣🥺
A perfect way to say good bye is “ Seee ya”! If you know, you know
i remember firs watching ur hijacked double nuke with ksg (i think it was 2x nuke)
Mw2 is so bad it made scump quite!
New pro player awaits
Love you legend

Legend shit 👑
man why am i tearing up, thanks for all theres years of entertainment and the impact you had on mine and millions of others lives, love u scumpy
Scump, I just want to personally thank you for being you and bringing so many wonderful memories back. Thank you for being the one I turned to when times were hard and when I felt like giving up on gaming. Thank you for all the years you’ve been an absolute east on the sticks and the amazing times laughs and tears of joy and sorrow through the ups and downs of COD. You’re truly one of the greats and there’s no one else I look up to more in the gaming world than you. I had always dreamt of one day being a pro gaming and living that dream and it all started with you. I know I’ll never make it to that point because of chaps like yourself out there absolutely dogging plebs like myself but you gave me dreams and hopes, and for that I thank you. I truly wish you the best in your future endeavors. I know all of us fans will always love you. TEAM GREEN FOR THE WIN. Give us one last show, one last time show us, no the world why you’re the goat. Much love to you.
🐐🐐🐐

i remember when your gamer tag was still scumper jumper 😢
Ouch, this one hurt. So many years of watching you play when we were both teenagers at the time. I have not touched a Call of Duty game since your legendary days of BO2 and it's cemented I will never touch another COD now. I'll never forget those times though. Thank you for the privilege of watching you play. Good luck in all your future endeavors Seth I hope this last year is the best to remember for you. See ya!
Goddamn growing up is not getting any fucking easier. Jesus Christ. I barely even watched competitive cod but just seeing the community I grew up with…growing up…sheesh.
What @Seidon Said You inspired a whole generation to keep on competing and never give up on the goal🐐 The Last Dance💚🖤

Man the end really got me.Like he’s sitting back and watching his whole career flash in front of him.Gives me chills.
Sad you made cod great
Please go become a COD dev and make COD good again. Tired of them releasing piles when the games have so much potential to be amazing
Dude the "See ya" at the end hit hard
This is one of the best made videos I've ever seen. I am trembling with emotion right now. Love you Sethy, even though I don't even know ya, feels like you're one of my best buds. Best of luck this coming season, and with everything else that the future holds for you. Greenwall forever.

This definitely brought a tear bro ,😢
Thank you scump
Getting out while the getting is good I see!...... something is fishy about this lmaooo it makes no sense especially since it’s his main source of income?!?! Seems like cheat streaming is the next play for him an if not then definitely a company.  Either way we know what you’ve done scump and your trash for it! Always will be.
You’re an inspiration
This was sick scump, you did a really nice job with this one. Hope this last year goes great for u!
Thank you King Scump for what you've done in the community there will be no one ever take your spot has king of COD

Started watching Scump during Bo2, and man was it fun to be a CoD fan back then. The best game with the best era of pro players imo. Even Scump's most popular videos are all on BO2. Haven't watched competitive CoD in years, but this video brought me back to those incredible days. Forever a gaming legend!
Nooooo 😞😞😞
Seth, I hope when you go out there, you will again shout out super loud that sentence again “Who’s the best in the game!!!” Let’s goooo Scumpii
I'm 24 11 years man time is just gone kids today just don't know the early years of cod and YouTube as we all get older memories is all we have.
Nah nah fuck all that don’t get discouraged by Tom Brady retiring then unretiring is the move
Goosebumps man. What a legend
I may wanna be in faze for sniping but I’ll always come back to give people the send of they deserve the competitive side of cod will never be the same without you we all love you ur the best and honestly I hope your doing ok ❤
Who is this guy?
its a bit weird to me that he stated this so early vs just annoucning it at the end of the season
Yo who’s cutting onions?
You were an idol growing up. Wish you the best thank you for everything 🙏🏽
🔥🔥
Scump the legend 😢.
Thank you scump! ❤
Thankyou Scump, been a pleasure watching you from Mw3, watching you get Moabs pub stomping, and then trying to replicate that with my mates during my formative years is some of my best memories :) Look forward to following you through the next stages of career :D
A God
Damn, I thought this was Blake Rosier.... that would have been a bummer.
The Goat of COD! You will be missed.
The 🐐
Scump going out like Kobe 🐐
You are hands down the goat.. this is like Tom Brady, MJ, Kobe, etc retiring.
Stop it, it ain’t April first 🥲

I don’t play cod anymore because I moved on with life but I always reminisce on the times I did and watched your videos to get better. you are part of my life quite literally. hope I can meet you one day and tell you this in person. good luck with your next journey ❤
I usually don’t comment on youtube videos or videos in general but when I saw this I knew I just had to say something. Thank you Seth for creating COD for what it all came to be. Grew up playing COD. I would come home from school and watch your videos then after immediately would try to perform like how you did in the game. Yes even changed my clan tag to T2P haha. Looked up to you man. Thanks for everything.
From playing on the couch as a little boy to being a world wide competitor for the thing we all loved as little boys is so cool man. Congratulations on everything you've achieved I loved watching all your videos and wish you nothing but success as you venture away from competitive gaming 🙏
goat
You were the first cod player I ever watched as a kid Had a lot of awesome memories ever since black ops 1 I was watching you. Your a legend. A Goat! Thank you scump💪🏻 For everything 😎
Thank you for everything goat 💚
The 🐐
I don't know him too well other than he's a competitive COD gamer but somehow I feel so sad and nostalgic about this video and I don't know exactly why--other than the video is very well made.  (I do play COD multiplayer recreationally.)  Best of luck to him in future endeavor.
VGHS Brian D vibes tho
One more ride man make it worthwhile
The COD competitive community will never be the same 😢🫡

It's great that you're moving on Scump. I was very touching to see where you started and to transition through your years in just minutes. No words were needed to give us the message "this is your last year". Very moving overall. Regardless of any of us being pro or not, we can all relate to where we were as gamers to where we are now.
Scumper jumper you are a GOAT. Thanks for all the memories and content over the years. I loved how you wore your emotions on your sleeve and held nothing back! Seeeya!
You will be missed <3
Truly... incredible...
Gave me goosebumps! Thanks for everything you’ve done to help put competitive Cod on the map. Still won’t forget meeting you at MLG Columbus way back in 2013
You can only become a legend once you’re no longer there you deserve to be a legend you held it down for the longest
I’m crying and it’s 4 seconds in. My entire childhood
The man who inspired an entire generation of gamers. abosolute fucking legend and without a doubt the  most prolific gamer of all time. GG
Optic will never be the same
Wished I always kept gaming and pushing as a kid to be like you Scumpy. I got to live my dream through you buddy…. Even if you never read this thank you man.
Started watching you compete when it was BigTymer, Nade, and Merk… it’s been a hell of a ride Scump! Give the fans one last ride and let’s make it a good one! 💚
We are gonna miss you buddy! I've been following you since Day one. Follow your dreams and hope for great success.   -EvilEyeZ
😂😂 this geek made this video like he cured cancer or he’s the first guy to walk on the moon. Fuck outta here.
Noooo please scump😭😭
absolute inspiration in cod esports
Man i remember staying up all hours of the night watching your gameplay for bo2 so i could get better. And then the same for bo3. Your 70kill tdm challenges were crazy man, you inspired me to get better at cod but everything good must come to an end sometime. It was fun while it lasted
Not just the face of competitive Call of Duty, Scump is the face of Call of Duty
Fucking music a bit much you ain't dying bro!   Everyone hit this stage when you grow old. I had 1000s of friends and real good crew. But you end up leaving each other.   It's like high school kids.. Don't think gaming will be there for you do ever. Comes a time where you don't feel it, and you just can't have reaction times good enough to keep up.   You had a good run but the league is shit and by the sound of it. Scump runs it. Just by the 30000 people that grew up playing with him.
If u didn’t tear up during this, your not human
Dude if I can ever meet you with my brother we will both tell you we wanted to be just like you we played and played and played for years on end we love you Scump trust
i ain’t crying, y’all are 😒
Wow I’m 23 years old and had the best times riding the hypes of different call of duty’s with scump and watching his gameplays. The hype and experience’s of those time can’t be matched, this hit me
It was a good run, ima miss you!
The whole reason I got jnto competitive COD was because of you SCUMP!  ggs and what a great career go get you one more for the boys!
This man was my childhood 😔
the new gen when never know how important you were in the uprise of call of duty competitive gaming, we love you Scump!!! <3
I've never been into watching you but I knew you was a class player I was more into joining clans and becoming a trickshot king but knowhere near as good as faze or optic I mainly watched faze apex linkzy rug adapt and rain oh and pamaj and jev but the older I got I just faded away I started gaming when the first cod world war came out and gamed through the best memories black ops 1 and black ops 2 will always be the best games but good luck to you in the future buddy
Damn....
Your black ops 2 videos are a core memory for me
A legend will always be remembered🔥💯
this is crazy. i’ll miss you
Love you
Been supporting you since bo2... sad to see this day come, but so glad I could watch your journey in real time. Thanks for changing our childhoods for the better <3
man this was so well done
Bo2 boys stand up if you remember him back in the good old days…
i cried
Does this mean I have to grow up ;(
10/10 production on this video
we will miss you scumpy❤️
Your the man!! Thanks and we will enjoy one last year
I'm from a different cod (codm) but i've watched this man play and compete for a long time, inspired me to run a sub everytime and copied his playstyle. Man thank you seth, you will go down as the greatest, the most explosive, the most twisted smg player in the history of cod.
Damn man… legend
Damn man that scene with the original Xbox and halo 2 made me very emotional 😭.
Wow what a legend
Bruh.. I really got emotional seeing this lmao Scump the GOAT. 13-14 years watching you guys. Loved it every moment along the way.  Hope retirement treats you well man and hopefully you have one last amazing year. Good luck scumpy
He not relevant because cod isn't. And cod are trash now unfortunately. But GGs
Dude I’m about to cry what the fuck
“WHO’S THE BEST IN GAME BABY!WHO’S THE BEST IN THE GAMEEEEEEEEE”
What a hell of a ride i been watching for close to a decade and youll ALWAYS be the king to us. Nobody will EVER do what scumpy did to the cdl. I look forward to tuning into every game this season and watching it all unfold GREENWALL FOR LIFE
Long live the King 🤴
I’m gonna miss you king
thanks for the memories❤️
I dont like crying like this but fuck, hit me right in the feels. I can relate to scump, all the years playing cod and looking back is emotional. Wow
You will be missed
I’m not crying .. you are ..
The god of gods 😭💯
😢
Absolutely love how you sent this message out before the season. Good luck king. Big part of my high school years. Thank you for everything Seth
thanks for the memories! SCUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The real 🤴
We’ll miss you scump  you’ve been part of life for over 8 years man
Wow 😓😓😓😓
Nah. I can’t be reading this right. Seth, you saved my childhood. I remember watching your MLG tourneys on B02 with Optic and that was literally the best times of my life. Imma miss all of your content man.
Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened ❤   We all could’ve been alive at any moment in earths timeline, yet we got the chance to be around scump and watch his legacy 💚 GREENWALL FOREVER 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
The Ginger God of COD
The king ❤️
Typical ♥️♥️♥️
Started watching you when I was 13, now I’m 22. I was never the best in school and hated it, but I always looked forward to the holidays so I could watch your videos and grind out BO2 with the lads. I’m doing well in life now, got a lot of things going on for me,  but that 13 year old kid will always be alive in me, sitting in front of the tv, pretending I’ve gone pro and signed for OpTic.  Thank you for all the memories you’ve helped me create, without even knowing me.  Thank you for the childhood that I would never trade for any other. Here’s to the best in the fucking game. Here’s to your last ride, King. 💚
So much emotion, end of a legacy and call of duty that we remember! GGs and thank you Seth!
I remember each morning I watch bo2 videos of this guy and seeing this makes me sad bro
Man sad to see so many gamers leave youtube 😔 it won't be the same
no more sweatbannin😭😭
Thanks scrump for the memories
Thank you for everything. I will support you till the end. Thank you for carrying us along for helluva journey. #EndOfAnEra #Greenwall #THEBESTINTHEGAME
MW2019 - Karma Cold War - Formal Vanguard - Crimsix MW2022 - Scump  The end of an era.

T2P 4L
Man I’ve been watching you and optic since MW3 and BO2 with the og squad I’m crying up alittle it’s been amazing watching you, whatever is next you will crush it. Thank you for being apart of my childhood
I may never have met you online “the world of gaming”. But thank you for being apart of my childhood as we both grew up. Watching you play one of my favorite games of all time like a brother in the background.
Damn. I told myself id finally feel old when scump retired. Thanks for all the memories. Have a great retirement.
Oh man love the clip of him sitting on the dining chair with the makeshift
watching this made me kind of emotional lol brought back a lot of memories. I was in middle school when mw2 came out. Been watching Scump for a long time. I remember watching Optic competitive videos and Scump just destroying kids while simultaneously being obsessed with trick shotting and watching FaZe Temperr hit suicide clips on High Rise. Even Chris Smoove was playing CoD back then. Ahhhh the good ol' days.
No shame. Cod has been ass for nearly a decade
Such a fuckin ICON
Jesus Christ scump had me cryin
Just goosebumps
The Goat. You will remain the greatest player out this life time. Thank You For Gracing Our Screens. This is sad news I grow up with you. I understand you are moving on and I can't wait to see what is next for you.I support you matter what.  All Hail The King 👑

Omg Noo fucking way ! The GOAT IS CLOSING THE BOOK !😢😢
Can still hear scump screaming “who’s the best in the game”
Scump. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE knows of your legend. Regardless of the outcome, this final run will be monumental. As someone that has been here since almost the beginning. I hope to see you succeed outside the grand scope of competitive CoD.
Noooo I’ve watched u for years this can’t be😭😭
Wow end of a era😢 the king the face off a gaming community thanks for al the great moments and goodluck with your last dance ! I will watch and support!!
I can't believe it. 😥🐐
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
You had legitimately been a mentor and an inspiration to us all in the gaming community. Thank you for the hours of entertainment and insane plays over the years for us to enjoy. You will never be forgotten. (Cross map kills with the scorpion!) will be a trademark now 😂❤️
The scump, nadeshot, bigtymer, and Hecz days 😢 so crazy how time flies
Quitting is for the weak. Don’t throw in the towel yet. Do a full 20 and break away happily ever after !❤
What a beautiful video! I may not watch a lot of pro COD, but even I know how much Scump means to the competitive gaming scene. Godspeed, legend.
I'm 24 now, you were the last link to my childhood and I guess its time to grow up now, where did time go?
Scump thank you for everything I’m turning 24 soon and just like other folks here you were a huge part of cod for me and I just wanted to say I enjoyed the optic house vlogs always had me excited to become and adult and game and go get chipotle lol thanks for everything legend🫡
Watching you play for almost 10 years broodie , was a privilege 🫶
Banners hang forever!!!! Long Live Scump
This actually made me very sad to watch. Been watching you for a LONG time, but I’m sure you have an extremely exciting new chapter ahead of you and I wish you the best of luck in everything you pursue.
That video actually gave me chills man. Being here every step of the way makes this extremely sad to see but extremely grateful I got to witness the greatness!
my turn to take over the world  the start of a new era begins today. 💯
Xx
Im sad
A living legend Fr🙏🏽 I’m 23 now r we r watching scump in middle school. Time is precious don’t waste it
Bo2 scump is the reason I play claw to this day 🥲
Geez. My first cod was modern warfare 2 and I remember my cousin telling me about this guy named Seth in Black Ops 2 and that’s how I started watching the competitive scene and pubstomping. Thank you for the years of amazing memories and cheers
man you absolutely changed how i felt about COD growing up, in a good way too. you've inspired not only myself but millions of others. kick ass like you always do <3 gl
Damn this gave me chills..
Damn, it's been an incredible ride watching you grow as a competitive player and content creator. Lowkey sad I might never get to see you compete in person, but I'm excited to see how badass your run with MW2 will be.
Scump your retirement will end a golden era of cod! You’ve come a long way and hope the decision you make is a good one! Thank you for the endless crazy memories. Hope you do well this year and end on a good note!
Bro the editing on this video is amazing damn scump
The legend of competitive cod since we were kids. Kick some ass this last year scump we're pulling for you!
Why is he quitting
The new cod game is so dogshit it caused scumpi to retire lmao
Crazy, I been watching you since I was 17. I'm now about to be 30. Thank you for the memories. You'll forever be an icon in the cod community.
This my last cod too. It's just not the same and since you're leaving too there's not much cod has to offer me anymore
Enjoy what you created for yourself GOAT ... ❤️
Goosebumps bro… wow, congrats on everything
You’re the guy who had in love with COD, forever will love you bro, been there since your modern warfare 2 days, will forever have a place in all our hearts brother
Heroes get remembered….LEGENDS never die
I’m crying
This hits home hard thanks for everything you’ve done for us scump ❤️
Very well made! Emotional. I saw you at EGL5 in Blackpool, you won. I didn’t.  I’ve been following you for a while and I wish you all the best!
Maybe after he's done he'll finally expose the cheating and corruption in gaming and bring the entire shit down!
Thank you for all!! Mister Scump
Scump you may be retiring from competitive play but plz keep making YouTube videos you r the king of console games
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
It’s been a pleasure ✊🏼 Thank you for all the screentime, and all the late night binge watching🥲
💚💚💚
Father time catches to everyone but thank you for the memories!
Thank you for everything Seth! You were a true inspiration. Absolute legend. All the best for your future💚
Damn bro! 😭😭
One last dance, you have done so much for this community! You will be sorely missed competitively but you deserve the break! I wish you the best last season though, hopefully you’ll get the fairytale ending you deserve ❤️
Thanks for the memories scump
Thank you so much scumpy for introducing me to the whole competitive COD! I pray your future endeavours reward greatly and remain safe always! Thank you bro and god bless ❤️
Dude you were the one who got me to stick with gaming.  You got me through so much.  It sounds dumb but I have red hair also and I always looked up to you vs other gamers.  Thank you man I’ll never forget your videos and the joy they brought me growing up
This gave me a lump in my throat ❤😢 thank you for everything Seth, you made us “outcast/weird” kids feel special, you gave us a purpose, COD wouldn’t be what it is today if you never picked up that controller, our community wouldn’t have been as legendary as it was if it wasn’t for you, you stand for a generation of COD that will never exist again, again, thank you for everything brother ❤
They should make a documantery about the COD competitive scène and interview al the old players and rewind al the big tournaments that we had over the past 12 years or something
Thank you bro
optic gaming house, What A Time to Be Alive
bro nadeshot won in life while yall were playing ur little cod game he made his own org
Always been my favourite pro, and quite honestly, some years, the only man that's kept me loyal to optic.  "It's never over while scump's still on the map"   Gunna miss you, king 👑👑👑
“I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.” Thanks for the memories scump
Love how tastefully this was done.  For the last few years since I stopped playing, you have been call of duty to me, the game was irrelevant.  Sad to see you go from the game.  Congratulations on all your success and I wish you the absolute best in the future.  Later.
Almost enough to make ya sad.
Dang we all here i guess...
This is sad to see man but happy for you bro 👏🏽 thank you for the memories
the greatest decision you ever made was staying loyal to hecz
This video really made me feel like it was the end of an era 😭
This gave me goosebumps, we love you seth. You were our childhood.
The problem with being the GOAT is that he has to retire or he’ll be outshine ‘em all forever. Scumperjumper = COD
LEGEND !!!
You are My childhood 😢❤
Helluva Video👌🏼👌🏼👍🏻
Grateful for getting to be part of the journey. Quite the way to get folks ready. Going to miss getting to check in from time to time. Thanks for sharing some of the personal side of such a demanding work culture. Cheers Scump.
I will be following this like I never have before.. this is crushing
Noooooooooooooooooooo……………!!!!!!!
Fuck I’m getting old
Does this mean you will be done with YouTube as well
Bye
Well after you retiring best believe snowflakes and wokeness will take over competitive gaming
Man this sucks🥺 I remember I started watching you in the mw2 days
Let’s go out with a bang brother you’ve already achieved your G.O.A.T status. Competitive won’t ever be the same without the little ginger dude 😂
THE GOAT, this video just hit me so hard in the nostalgia wtffff  Thanks for everything Scump, OpTic, and CoD!
no! i refuse.
When the video ended I just had a huge moment, all of the black ops 2 memories hit me so hard. I was so excited every time you and nadeshot posted a video, you are going to be missed
Literally can’t watch this video it’s destroying my inner child and me
Cod is not going to be the same without scumpii
It was just too easy for you. I don’t blame you for retirement
The GOAT 😢
Who’s the best in the game?  You are Seth!  Gonna miss you!
Scums you da 🐐🐐🐐 !!
It’s been a glorious ride , Seth.
Ah damn, unbelievable, just you are respectful af good luck and have fun dude! :')
when I say I teared up.I mean it. Growing up I wanted to be scumpy. Man is and always will be my favorite COD player of all time. Huge part of my childhood. I never thought this day would come.🥲
If you dont win the last big one, you gotta go another year, cant go to bed on a loss numsayin'?
That was one hell of a retirement speech.  It will never be the same without you.  The legend will always live on. 👍
Scump is like the Kobe equivalent of cod for me in the way that when you throw a paper ball into the trash you yell “Kobe!”  Well in this case when someone is extremely good playing you say “who are you? Scumpy?” That would never go away for me.   Thanks scump.
This doesn't mean he done gaming I believe he done with comp 🥲
Scump your the fucking GOAT 🐐
Been watching you since BO1. What a legend.
BO2 era .. fasho miss it
Damn it😢
We love you scumpy
HOLY FUCK
Hats off to you brother 💪🏾 One more memory brother. Go get us gamers that trophy one more time legend! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾

I remember coming home from school and just getting after cod i always heard about the great Scump I’m glad i was able to see this Era of you and you will forever go down in the books as Legend thank you 🙏🙏🙏🙏.
Scumpii! Thank you! Just thank you.

Not gonna lie this video brought tears to my eyes I remember watching the tournament like yesterday cheering for #GREENWALL
My GOAT🐐💚🤍
We love you bro it’s bin a hell of a ride!Thank you for carrying us with all your heart!🦾👏🏽🙏🏽😭
FU***** GOAT‼️‼️
Man almost quit back in bo2 for high school. Imagine if you didn’t commit to this haha. Love you scumpy! You were a huge inspiration to me back in old school league play. Middle school and high school days. 23 years old now and I put down cod a while ago. But I’ll never forget the great moments from back in the days even before the first OG house. All love brother.
I grew up watching you and it has been a honor following you throughout your journey wish you best of luck and remember keep on keeping on my friend
Seth Abner best cdl player ever to live don't understand why Hes retiring. can someone tell me why
I've watched this video like 20 times now.. I've been watching you since I Started playing Online COD.. Crazy how the time has flown by.. You're My GOAT. Ima watch some competitive COD play again this year. I miss it. GLHF
I’ve watched you and every pro match since I was 13.. I even watched the full match of when you meet nadeshot the first time when you were on opposite teams on mw2 when it came out In 2010 when it was uploaded if I remember right. I’m 27 now and your the inspiration to how I play now. It hurts to see you leave the pro league but I know this is another step for you and If I learned anything you will just be brutal and savage in anything you do. Your adaptive skills are unparalleled. You are without a doubt the best cod player. There is no debate because what’s considered amazing now is just a bunch of solo playing streamers. Many have risen in the debate but they are streamers only and not pro players and can’t carry over for obvious reasons. I wish you the best cause you alone got me through a lot even my career in the army thank you mr scumpii!!!
It was an honor to watch you play. I’ve grown up watching you. You will be greatly missed.😢
Gg scump
My favorite ginja ninja. This vid hit me
One last Dance ?
You were the best buddy
Damn bro.. The Jeter of COD
All love
been watching my guy since he was 12...now he is retiring....im fucking old man lol....but I must say It was a hell of a ride. I had the honor to watch a dynasty be built, dismantled and then rebuilt again. #greenwall #opticforever
You lived all of our dreams bro, just enjoy the moment this year regardless of the outcome brother.❤ thank you
“You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today And then one day you find ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun”
this was so sad to watch scump was growing up the person no matter the team or anything i wannted to win Lets Go Scump..... Best Player Till I Die
end of an era
I feel like that was really profound then he really did just smash off the ending in 3 seconds with. “Last year. Later”
The Jordan Ali brady of call of duty! I hope you jump into content creation man Iv been watching you for far too long to stop now! Thank you for all the great times my guy!
I'm 27 now, first call of duty was bo. I barely play games anymore. But this era is where most of my happy memories lie. Thank you for being a part of that Scump.
You managed to make a grown man cry.
.

This is honestly the most sad I’ve ever been.. it’s like end of the MJ era 😓
Actually emotional rn. I started playing comp back in bo2. I used to grind all day for so many years and you were my top1 inspiration. Even though I don’t play anymore, I still look at your content as a nostalgic entertainment. End of an era for sure and def kinda closed my days even more. GL in your future plans King Scump 👑 !

Like I've said in a previous video I saw you when you first joined optic and you have been my favorite cod gamer ever since
The end of an Era. We gonna miss you scump. I didn't watch your matches but I watched your clips and that's inspired me to start getting better because I want to become a pro CoD player one day
Damn scump we the same age and I’ve been watching you since the beginning MW3 days. Legit cried ❤ 😢 can’t believe this it
Wow man the feels with the intro 🥲
😭
HA @scump WHAT A FUCKING RAGE QUIT 😂
🐐
The FIRST name anyone ever knew in competitive CoD
I’m sorry your last year has to be on the worst cod of all time
Cya
Wow !
Just the professional scene right? Will u still make videos?
Your content helped me while I was battling crippling depression and brought a ray of sunlight in my life when there was nothing but darkness around me. You made a genuine impact in my life. Much love and good luck in the next chapter. ❤
Some rando I don’t know
unfortunately this is it for scumpii, this is MLG, once you retire thats it! No coming back like NFL or UFC athletes.
cod. Is that like, "thanks for all the fish" ?
If this is the end, I will not subscribe. Moving on.
Scump Listen Finish it same as when you started Sweat bannin
its crazy to think im the first person to win a online tournament with scump!
Optic4L
With the maps on cod this year I also am retiring ❤️😞
Why am I being recommended this? I have never seen this man in my life nore do I like call of duty. But uh. Fare well I guess? I mean no offense truly im sure you were great if the comments are anything to go off of. Ive just genuinely never seen ya before.
This is the result of Call of duty being trash and this is what you guys get for hating boost jumps. Scump is retring because MW2022 is the worst COD ever made and the franchise will never be great again. You guys only have yourselves too blame.
Yo That hoodie is dope where can I get that?
I am truly sad
Smdh my favorite player is retiring smdh idk if i could watch competitive cod anymore after
Win champs that is the goal you need to go out on top, need to see you in some other form of competition though warzone would be nice
Can’t really blame him for being done. What’s the point in competing when the devs of cod know people are cheating and allowing that? It would piss me off as a legit player too.
I'm not crying
The amount of smg players this man birthed, literally been watching this man since middle school now in college a full grown adult it’s sad almost as if a part of our childhood is closing forever now.scump will forever be the goat the king of cod what a great career Seth 💚
My favorite pro player. 🏆
You got me through a lot, Scump. Let’s make this last year count!
Damn 😢 I can’t believe it
Who is this nugga? Lol why is he in my recommended
The King of Call of Duty. It’s not going to be the same without you. 😔
Lets get this last Chip baby!
Stop im gna cry
The end is always a new beginning. -John
Been watching you since black ops 1 days, 12 plus years now. You’ve had such a crazy run and have always played at such a high level every single YEAR. I hope this last run is amazing and you have fun all the way through it.
the face ,the legend , the king  enjoy
You’re literally apart of my childhood bro wouldn’t be the cod player i am today without Scump
Damn you crazy Seth, I admire your hard work and hustle! Well deserved retirement!
IT IS TIME FOR ADOLESCENT MEN TO LEAVE BEHIND ADOLESCENT GAMES TO SEEK WORTHY GOALS OF REAL VALUE.  GROW UP!!!
NOOOOO 😢
I dont know why i keep coming back to tbjs
It's crazy how all these guys in the comments that slept with my mom are now so sentimental about Scump's retiring. 🤔
I refuse to believe i was the only one who thought the meant he died
Scump will forever be the goat
Apparently, this is relevant to some people...
This is goodbye, but if you want more……subscribe ?
2012 - 2022 what an era!
After playing every cod in existence and playing most fps games my whole life. This is the first time a professional gamer has made me wanna tear up. This gave my goosebumps. Farewell scumpii. You gave it an amazing ride
Got to meet the king twice in Gfininty London, Do not watch competitive cod anymore but have so many memories watching. Enjoy retirement scump
Damn all the og are gone
Thank you for being part of my childhood. I’ve watched you for 11 years at 14yrs old me and my friend. I am now 25yrs old and my friend passed away. He would’ve loved to see all the accomplishments you’ve done cause you were his favorite. Grinding 8hrs a day because you were someone we looked up to. I haven’t played COD games like that since but I never forgot about you. Thank you for the endless memories Seth. I hope retirement is a good one for you 🍻
At least we have hundreds of compilation videos of your best moments. I'll miss you scumpi
Scump was a childhood idol❤
GOAT
Thank you Scump🙏🏻
These made me tear up a bit ngl Scump you have been a inspiration not just to me but millions of other people thank you for everything much love brother

Crying real tears 😢😢😢
Wow! It's been a ride... I feel off CDL for about 3 years, first person I came back to when I gained interest again was Scump. You're a legend bro! Let's go out with a bang!
I'm gonna miss the great king plays .....wish u wasn't leaving us 🤯🤯🤯
Well all I hope is you continue to stream so we can still watch and enjoy man
dont even know who the fuck are you but ok
Scump has to be around the cod league some how. Everyone loves him and his personality is 2nd to none
Legends never die
Nooo 😢

He’s old now ❤ but to me he will always be Scumper Jumper “

Actually had a lump in my throat watching this😪
Beautiful Video, Legendary
Wow makes me miss the cod community so much. Back when I was 16 and spending days grinding out cod edits in my parents house… I always look back on those days with the warmest memories
Damn that’s emotional for me I grew up watching you since BO1
I don't even like video games but this video was reccomended to me and now I'm just sitting here crying waiting for my coffee to brew🥺💔
Grew up watching you slay lobbies. One of my favorites. Your an inspiration to young gamers everywhere. I’m almost 30 now and I show your videos to my 8 year old son all the time. Truly one of the best. Thanks Scump.
Lloran las nucleares
About to make this one an absolute banger!! 🐐🐐🖤

Enjoy this year as much as u can Scump
Noooooo
The goat, forever and always💚
Scump I've been watching for over a decade. I started watching when I was maybe around 11 and I just turned 22. Your journey and your talent always amazed me even as a kid. There's been countless days you brought joy to my day with your content. You're truly the best of all time. Can't wait to see what's next for you. It's the end of an era but not the end for you. Much love❤️
Scump I have been following you for along time now. You made esports to what it is now!
Scump needs his own one last dance documentary
THE GOAT
You guys do know what this is right... he just got engaged ... he just wants 1 year to get marry and then honeymoon... then he'll be back after a year... don't worry guys its a clickbait
One Last Ride Baby 💚
Who? Professional????? 🤣
Seth, I remember meeting you and getting a picture at umg South Carolina during black ops 3. I’ve been watching you since 2012 when I was just 11. Here we are 10 years later and I’m about to graduate college, and you’re in your final year of COD. Such a crazy thing to think about and I can’t explain how much you’ve influenced me over the years. You’ll forever be a legend
This got me bricked up man FR FR <33333 LETSGO GREEN WALL
Such an emotinal video, I was there for almost every step since black ops 2 man, Love you Seth! <3
This hit. All the love brother
love you my ginger daddy
Goosebumps man, as much as it hurts to see Scump leave after this COD. You have to give him RESPECT for how long he has been at the top keeping up with the new gen of COD players. From winning Champs back in IW days, to insane clips and clutches all the way to winning the Warzone 100K tournament (him being an underdog as well). I can't wait to see what his next chapter is after this! Hopefully he maybe transition to a new game and become even more of a GOAT just like Formal has. LETS GO FOR THIS NEXT COD SEASON!!! OG for life!
the goat baby !!!!
You done playing game entirely or just playing cod professionally ?
The last ride is the greatest
😢 wild edit 10/10
I just wanted to say thank you for everything I’ve watched you from the old mw to present! Got me into cod and everything. Gave me chills watching I felt like I was there every step! Much love scump!
The. We can see him stumping ppl on warzone 😂
The last dance of the 👑👑👑👑.
Damn… he hanging up the gloves 😢… it’s been a pleasure 👏
I will never forget the magic of the Black Ops II era of competitive Call of Duty. What an amazing throwback this video was.
I miss the good old days man wow time flys, sweatbanding Pro players your whole career, Scump you'll always be the OG King 👑💚 much love Brotha
The end of an era.
Im not crying your crying
listen i’m 29, i’ve been playing cod since cod 2.. i’ve been watching scump and other professionals grow throughout the years, can’t believe i’m old enough to watch some of them retire especially the goat himself. 🤝🖤
I’m not crying you are😢 stump is a fxcking legend.
No please 🥺❤
A fantastic person.
😢
Who are you?
Playing video games is so tough! Mental health matters !!
End of an era.
Bros done sweatbannin 😔
Scump man, thank you for everything,
Watched you from the pub stompin bo2 days, you will always be my favorite competitive cod player. This video is a cinematic masterpiece. The fact that we can see you, and your reaction to your amazing gaming career. It brings tears to my eyes my man, you've completed this part of the journey with outstanding remarks. The question is, what's next for Scumpi?
You exist?
For one last time baby!! Go get that 2nd Ring that u deserve bro💚
Good less cheaters
congrats on a wonderful career, and all the best to you for your future.
the goat
This man is competitive call of duty for me lol. Well the day had to come but I don’t love to see it. Sad time, the scump and optic journey was part of my journey as the adrenaline the content gave me made me better most defo. Like the black ops 3-4 hype was my peak or biggest learning curve/improvements in game and I watched most of the cwl over those years. Peace and love to the goat who changed the scene. No one would be better as a cod caster or host of cwl. The pull scump would give them they’d need to pay more tho I feel 😅😂. Hang loose 🤙
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gonna miss you competiting Scump luv you Sethy. I remember growing up watching you play Black Ops 2 I've been playing CoD since Black Ops 1 made a young 23 year old girl cry my eyes out watching this gonna miss you, you were the face of OpTic you brought soo many people along with you I am one of them. BUT I AM READY FOR ONE LAST DANCE & JOURNEY WITH YOU SCUMP Let's make it like we're rolling back the years like good ol times Scump show the CoD world why your the King👑. Black Ops 2 days how times have change sadly everyone is going to miss you competiting Seth 💔. Make ur new Fiancée proud one last time do it for her💍🎮😢 No matter what no Champs trophy you'll always be a GOAT great legacy ur leaving behind for the future generations.   Thank You Seth for your Precious Time, Dedication, Humidity, Energy, Ur Competitive Drive, Humour, Comms, Trash Talking, Expressing urself etc etc I'll cherish some of those memories for years to come it brought tears to my eyes when you won in Major 1 in Vanguard I like to see it when ur happy & really enjoy winning something & live in the moment hopefully whatever comes next in ur journey will make you happy.   Thank You Seth ❤️#ForeverGreenWall🖤💚
its never goodbye
A Farewell Tour ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for all of the years of inspiration Scump. It's been a pleasure. And thanks H3cz for always showing us what a AAA organization looks like. The whole team is the blueprint.
You carried an entire competitive COD gaming generation. Thank you for all that you’ve done for us. ❤
Next professional video you gotta do that Fast and furious scene with “ Paul” walker  And dom. But Dom will be optic in one bus 😂
Been watching u since the beginning 💚
HOLY SHIT THE FEELS. Been watching since 2012 and it feels just like yesterday!! Don’t ever drop that crown KING! 👑
It's crazy to see are legends retire and progress but the game we once loved and grinded everyday is getting worse and copy and pasted every damn year😭💯
Dayum man that’s crazy I rmemeber when optic and complexity would battle it out
If he had a tear come down his face when he was smiling watching himself scream on stage I think that would have ended me.
The greatest to ever do it, thank you for a decade of memories since i was 7 brother. Supporting you in whatever you do next.
Boxing: Muhammad Ali Martial Arts: Bruce Lee Call of Duty: Scump
Gave me teary eyes.
Truly The GOAT. Wishing you the best bb in everything you do in the future <3
i cried.
now in my twenties watching this remembering when i came home from middle school, threw on a Scump video and fired up the ole MW3. watching you grow as i grow has been a bittersweet experience. i hope you give this last one all you’ve got 🤛 “ya hate to see it” but its gotta be done. much love brother
brotherrrr this reminds me of that Disney movie "Soul" where at the beginning Joe is walking through a similar black box showcasing everything he did in his life, this is a game changer, the league will never be the same. Can't wait for the content creating though its gonna be dope to see you chill out and have more time
Gutted to see you go Scump! But glad you’re retiring at the top of your game! 🔥🙌🏾🔥🙌🏾  Go get ‘em champ!
I remember you contemplating going to school or continuing gaming. it’s unreal what you’ve accomplished over the years Scump. thank you for the motivation & inspiration. thank you for sharing
Go crazy king
This video hit pretty hard not gonna lie, I seen retirement video before BUT wow this one was phenomenal, well put together Scumppi. WoW I’ve been watching you since 2010, when COD Black Ops came out. Cant believe the G.O.A.T is leaving professional COD.. the comps will never be the same. Gonna miss your name being screamed by the cod casters when you make the sick SMG plays ( the SMG GOD ), its leave professor COD. Let’s just hope the KING will stick around and still play cod on the regular though.
THE GOAT THE BEST THAT EVER DID IT 👊🏼
I remember back at MLG columbus (in 2013 or 2014 dont remember.) I was a junior in high school and a friend of mine was competing in the COD open bracket. (I was never a fan of COD but he asked our friend group to go with him and we did obviously.) But after the event we were sitting eating dinner at this restaurant and scump was there with his mom (keep in mind this was when he was like 17ish lol) we are the same age. But my friend wanted to talk to him so bad but he didnt because he didnt want to interrupt the dinner lol. Kind of surreal looking back seeing him there relatively unknown to now being like a competitive gaming household name
The beginning of the death of competitive console gaming
Damn, the chills
im not crying you are
It’s been a good run. You will always be the king. Long live scump
Oh sad! could've cut the video down to 8 seconds though, cause I just said goodbye to 2 mins of my life...
GOAT = scump 💚
Don't do it scump
This man’s pro career has been with me for so long I’m now 27!
Deadass tearing up watching this the end of an era you’ll always be remembered as the best scump 🤧🤞
End of era 💚💚 Thankyou for providing years of memories
So long King Scumpii.
YOU HAVE TO GO CRAZY FOR YOUR LAST YEAR> DONT HOLD BACK XD
Bro, I go into CoD having watched Optic at lan events, the king stomping pros like it was pubs to then be privileged to watch the optic/complexity beef over two seasons. That was the time when Cod had a soul and talent…. The nostalgia is running deep rn but scump, thanks for letting myself and the world experience cod how it was meant to be experienced - lan! I don’t blame you for leaving the hollow shell that is cod comp of today. See you down range bro!
I’m ready for the Netflix doc to come out you’ve changed the game forever dawg #lastdance
I've enjoyed a lot watching you play. Stay frosty bro 👊
Thanks for everything Scump =')
Thank you, Scump. You’ve been my favorite Call of Duty player ever since I started watching CDL. You’ve been a true inspiration to everyone in the Call of Duty world, including me. It’s been a pleasure watching you.
Absolute legend. Let’s ride for one last championship
WOW I HAVE WATCHED SCUMP SINCE I WAS IN 3RD GRADE !!!! Never will forget the days of OG Optic when they were in Chicago, the day of BO2 and Ghosts. Great times. Thank you Scump for the memories !
The amount of people you have inspired to keep grinding, will not only be used for games, but as a life skill. Your content has helped people through hard times and ultimately changed their lives. Thank you Scump, a true king.
Man a true end of an Era! I've been watching you since the black ops 2 days. Hope your still gonna make content afterwords!
Wow its been such a long run, I remember watching you, the OpTic, FaZe etc for many years going back to 2011 when I went back to playing video games (CoD) so sad to see you finish off.
After all these years the GOAT is finally laying his sticks to rest. Forever one of the GREATEST in CoD History!
Goat man!!
First Snipe now scump.
A Legend!🔥
Bwahahah this mf should’ve quit long ago
Nice. Just don't quit YouTube since it's ur job.
I’m 19 and although I wasn’t that into competitive cod, when I ever thought about it, I would think of this man straight away 💯
Damn. Love you, Scumpy.
Good bye freak never come back
King
You have helped a lot of us in many ways, especially as we grew up with you. Life is hard, you all know this. When I tuned into a scump, man it was like hanging with a best buddy.   Genuine dude that gave a lot of fucks. You put good out you’ll receive it back. You shared many fails and many successes and that in and of itself gives a lot of young men and women hope that winning is of upmost importance in this life, even if it’s just as simple as winning your day.   Thank you for the love, the emotions, the expressions, and just leading by example on what it is to be a positive entertainer in the gaming world/community.  Damn brother, what a journey thus far and many of us are damn happy to be on this plane of existence, at this exact time in the universe, experiencing you, now. Love you brother and dominate whatever your next jump is.
The MX Vs. ATV Unleashed game! 😭 My childhood 🥺
you made me get into cod and playing it with some sort of competitive edge. i’ve been watching you since you were a teen at your moms house, you are a legend, childhood hero and the best player i’ve ever seen touch the game. thank you and we all love you
Everyone acting as if he just retired, let’s save this until the end of the years boys and just enjoy the year :)
it was a good ride, thank you scump
One of the last few veterans to leave. Man it’s sad. Loved watching you and hope you stick around.
You will always be the KING 👑👑👑 Of CoD.
Thanks for all you’ve put into this and good luck!
💔
Sad truly.... i look up to you always man. you made me wanna go pro. still griding day and night
Dam. Memories
Goosebumps the whole time. What a legend
The greatest to ever walk the face of the Earth 🌎

You did good scump you deserve a rest soldier hope you get the happy ending you want
Chills and goosebumps, you really have marked everyone’s life in the COD community
An absolute legend.  My all time favorite player/content creator.  Started watching Seth and Nadeshot making BO2 videos, been a fan ever since.  Thanks for all the great content Scump!
🥲
Growing up watching you play since I was 16 . Now I’m 29 watching you play one last season, let’s bring this one home for the Greenwall.
If he hangs them up, I hang it up.. stump was the golden boy and the king. Nobody I loved watching more then Ginga Ninja
These young kids will never understand or know. Thank u legend for all these years of entertainment ❤️
I've watched you since the double Moab on MW3. I cannot believe this. Part of the journey is the end. You made call of duty fun. Absolute legend
End of an era
My heart feels heavy
ok
GOAT <3
I’m not crying you are
I love you Scumpy💙🌎🌎🌎 forever my favorite CoD player💙💙💙🌎🌎🌎 thank you so much for the inspiration. I will always root for you🌎 enjoy life!
I will never watch CDL when you're not in it. Alot of people feel the same.
I didn’t know this dude existed 3 minutes ago. I have no clue what COD is about. All I know is that was one for the best videos I’ve seen in a long time.
What an amazing video brother showing us all the journey we have been through with you, Your a living legend and I wish you the best for what you have to come.
“Yo yo yo, Scumpy here”  I guess the teenage versions of us are still here
I dont know much about PRO COD or honestly too much about Scump but wow, this was insane...
Damn this one hits hard
Damn 😢
the fucking GOAT truly the end of a era
Thanks Scump❤
The Era of the GOATs is coming to an end and Scump is another one to go😢
The goat!!!
Long live king scump #whosthebestinthegame Some of the greatest memories growing up watching you slay the main stage. All the best wishes on your future!
When i think about CoD I also think about Scump, back in his early days is also when I really got into CoD and I watched everything he did. Never knew a person could be so nostalgic, it’s the end of an era. We will miss those days.
What an amazing video serious but not as good as your legacy much love well deserved retirement
When BF gets so bad even the pros through the towel.
You better be fucking lying..and I mean it

Never forget scump at 2014 mlg anaheim, GOAT
Time to get a real job now son
Seeing that old Xbox console and games brought me back to much simpler times. Thanks Scump
I’ve been watching you for years and this just gave me chills Crazy when you reflect back on everything you’ve accomplished. Competitive cod will truly never be the same without Scump 😢❤
ya know seeing scump win his first MLG to him straight killing it to last year has been an honor like you have always and will always be the king of call of duty no matter where life takes you there will never be a day or call of duty where no one will know your name simple as that #onelastride #greenwallforlife
Just letting you know man you were a huge inspiration to my life and gaming ! Really helped me get through some tough time as a adolescent. We are really close in age and  i feel like its to early for you to leave but everything has its time. Your going to be dearly missed my many! I appreciate the time you gave us all, the hours of sleepless night you sacrificed, to me you are the MJ of COD. I hope your next chapter in life is just as great and you can inspire another person just as much as you did for me 🥲  -Fan since the Beginning ❤
We love you King Scump!
so close to crying
I blame this on Nadeshot and Formal Kappa Adios Foo you carried to hard i dont know how, your skill and voice and long time pro. I always say your the best but its Fax forreal ! No one can even beat my boy in a 1v1 💚
i started watching you over a decade ago, when i was just starting in high school. i’m now 21. you helped me a lot through bo2 days, so thank you. i loved coming hope and watching your videos. i miss seeing you start off with a burrito bowl from chipotle hahha. here’s to a new chapter~
Good to see you after all these years taking the hard choice to move on but love to see you out there one more time
say it aint true 😥
I grew up watching you Scump Cod won’t be the same without you buddy.
Eine lebende Legende!
It's fitting that it's with OpTic. Thanks for the memories Seth.
We all love you man wish you all the best for the last year sure you will smash it!!! The game won't be the same without you!! Love for 12 years from England!!! ❤️
The best there EVER was and WILL be
Wow cant believe it... Never gonna be the same
The KING
I was always a faze supporter, going back to the Prime BO2 day’s. However, Scump. You were so good, it was hard to not support you. The GOAT of competitive COD. There is nobody better, I am 25. He has had dominated since I was 13. 12 years of pub stomping pro COD players. You will be missed I have stopped watching COD for a very long time. I gotta watch the GOAT run his last Go.
chills. grew up sweat bannin’ and 70 kill challenging with you. used to refresh my feed until u would post league play games back in the day. crazy to think u could be so close to someone and never even meet them. thank you so much for everything. one last ride for the goat and i’m hype for what it has in store❤️
Now is CoD officially dead. RIP
We’re really gonna miss you scumpii ❤️
I was sad to see Rambo, Big T and Nade quit. But this one hurts man. GGs for the King of the last decade
The only reason I kept watching CDL. We watched a story unfold, through highs and lows.
Thank you, Seth🤍
I cried ngl. Proud to have watched this man be the goat of pro cod.
Cod is garbage now anyway. Maybe scump would rather spend time outside
Surreal. Thank you for putting a smile on my face as a young kid and getting me hooked on cod. With the smiles from videos or excitement from competing, you will always be a part of my childhood. We all miss the good ol days but I’m very glad we’ve come this far. Let’s finish on a strong note:)
Wow this one hurts. Scump has created so many memories for us all. He’s been there for our good, but most importantly our bad times. Love you scump💚 greenwall forever.
youre just the best scumpii
I’m in tears 🥹
Long live the King
You've had an amazing journey and I can't wait to see what life has in store for you next, never stop being you, love ya Scrump
Scump, I’ve been with you on this ride since 2014. You’ve been with me through all of my good and all of the bad times as well. I’ve seen you win champs and lose them as well. One thing is for sure; we have loved you through it all. I’ve watched you go to target to buy a banana suit, I’ve seen you eat probably more burritos with hecz than the human body should probably consume. From kill races with Pamaj, playing for Yeezys with Doug, the smooth competitions, the 1v1s, all of It. You have no idea who I am, where I live, what I do for a living: nothing. Yet I feel as if I grew up with you from the first time I played bo2. 7 years I’ve watched you grow into the most insane Internet personality. Yet that title doesn’t do it’s justice. No. Not for you, Seth. You are an inspiration to us all. I can’t believe this is it, yet I can as well. I started watching you when you were a 150 pound pasty red head and brand new to optic. Now you’re a Call of Duty champion. An X Games gold medalist. A soon-to-be husband and more….. my man. I can’t wait to see what you do from here. I can probably speak on the behalf of your entire community when I see this: WE LOVE YOU!!!     aaaaaaAAAAA-SEEYA
Thank you man for being part of my childhood 😕
I remember being 14 watching your very first LAN event in black ops 1 which you won.  Almost 12 years later, I’m long past cod, but this still hurts.  Good luck on your last dance King, hope you kick some ass.
Grew up watching you bro, one last ride and I’ll follow you into retirement and whatever you choose next ❤
Bro u were one of the main reason I started playing cod and even got better, thanks for all ur hard work and dedication to e sports and for inspiring others to have fun with the game and letting us watch u grow man ! much love
Not sure why this showed up on YT recommend, I've never heard of this YouTuber or even knew COD had competitions. But it looks like many do know you so good luck to you in your last year.
hella cringe

And I hope this last years goes out with a bang! Best of luck to the green wall this year I will be cheering you on like always!
I'm 28 and have grown up alongside with you, Seth. It honestly breaks my heart seeing you retire. As they say, all good things must come to end. It's been one hell of ride; one I'll truly remember. Thank you for all the memories. The GOAT!
Damn man 😢
Welp there goes my childhood watching the king 😢
If only Cod was what it use to be this probably wouldn't be happening...
This was 2 min long but felt like I just watched a full featured film

My GOAT
I cried

THE GOAT!!! THE GAME WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. SAFE TO SAY THIS WILL PROLLY BE MY LAST COD. WHEN KOBE RETIRED. WAS NO LONGER WATCHING NBA. NOW SAME GOES COD. THE GOAT MA. WISH YOU LUCK AFTER THIS ENDEAVOR.
Listen man I just gotta say... thank you for everything. You are an inspiration to me and many others and you've given me the ability to dream of a career that I love doing. I'm sobbing while typing this not because you won't be competing anymore but because you've given me so many memories. You are my hero scump. Really truly my hero and I just want to say thank you. Now get out there and do your best man
I've never seen any of their videos until this one
Been watching ever since the release of late Modern warfare games , and The early black ops, loved OpTc vs FaZe hard point Bo2 on Yemen watched it all live. Thank you for being a big portion of my childhood and getting me into gaming In general. love you Scumpii ❤
The King 👑
who diz
A legend, been watching and rooting for you since the 6050 house and to see how much you’ve grown is so surreal. It’s almost like yesterday when you were screaming “IM THE BEST IN THE GAME!!” 🥹 imma miss rooting for you after this year , to the king!!
Who is cutting the onions..?
Ya hate yo see it
Who gives a shit🤷
i dont even know who you are, but this was recommended to me and honestly it was one of the most cinematic goodbyes ive ever seen on this platform and boy have i seen too many people go
Y’all remember his 21st bday stream? 🥲
oh no not my competitive call of doots
Goat Status 🐐
Brooo noooooooo
You’re a legend
This is what happens when you release a game like vanguard 😔  For legal reasons, this is a joke.
One last ride for the king 👑 .
“Yo yo yo What is going on guys? It’s your boy OpTic Scumpi bringing you another Black Ops 2 live gameplay commentary here today!” This quote will forever and always hold a place in my heart. Stay Humble my man!
Saddest thing I’ve ever seen
end of an era, competitve cod will never be the same without you
It’s sad that YouTube will never be the same again
Goodbye king
Damn man… this got me emotional. I hope you understand the impact you’ve had on us. You were a huge part of a lot of people’s childhood and teen years, including mine. Still think about those times every now and then.
Didnt ask dont care
Cod sucks anyway lmao
Been watching you since I was 12!!! I’m 25 now!! 13 years of the best call of duty player to ever touch the sticks! I remember you and Nade having a dance battle at the OpTic house and you started doing the worm😂. Nobody will EVERRRRR top you EVERRRR. 88-0 kill game on BO2 Will forever be legendary along with swarming people in League Play 😂😂. You deserve to retire, hate to see you go, but we understand 🖤🖤🖤.
man remember every morning i used to log into the MLG app and watch you go crazy everyday. You and nadeshot were my childhood man love yall.
Good luck bro, make a great one
Man I have so much nostalgia of OpTic esports rn especially in the Advanced Warfare era
Funny how there are big channels like this and you never find them until their goodbye video.
So he’s done as of 2023?
Lol
You know it was only a year when I found out about you but I'm glad I did your me favorite cod player and I hate to see you go but we have to respect you and what makes you happy goodbye king
Forever will be the days where I would tune in to watch Optic, Scump as a fave of mine. I’ll always remember that… good luck my guy ❤
I watched every single one of your videos properly twice. Your the reason I became the player i was on cod
Damn scump not you😭☹️
Thank you Scump my love of COD has a lot to do with your old videos 10+ years
Bro i remember watching him back in black ops 2 good times
😢😢😢😢
😢
I’m never getting rid of my optic jersey.
indeed made me tear up...
Least he's a millionaire 👌 💵 😋
Ngl I was NOT expecting myself to be as sad about this as I apparently am😭😭
Watched your career bloom sad to see you go.
Didn't know who you were and didn't play cod until warzone. Saw your 37 kill Solo video and just haven't stopped watching sense, i was so inspired to not suck after that video i really started grinding, and now cod is a huge part of my free time and a healthy outlet for me in my life and my own personal struggles. Thank You, Seth. Seriously 💚
Don’t go scump 💔🥲
I have no idea wtf this man is but he seems like he's at peace with his decision. Good for him.
I knew this day was coming. Will miss you scumpy!! OPTIC GREEN WALL FOR LIFE!!!
Bro this made me wanna cry because that was my childhood, I’m 20 now and I wish I could relive those years of prime COD. Seth, you have changed my life forever because the amount of happiness I got from you whether it was on stage, or through videos is priceless. Will be cheering for ya this year
Good riddance to a guy I've never heard of making money playing a dumbass game
Wow this is incredible.
Ok
💔
Let mw2 2022 forever be known as the cod that truly killed off an Era
Forever the GOAT!
Thanks Scump. Never enjoyed watching a professional gamer more. Best of luck to what you choose to do in the future bro.
there’s no way man… this actually made me feel sad
Clickbait...
Thank you for everything ❤ glad to have gone through the goated part of cod sad to see it go but life goes on
amazing
Nothing better than going out on your own terms.
Are you leaving
Don’t even know who this guy is
God sent His only unique Son Jesus to suffer, die on the cross, and rise on the third day for our sins, believe in Him so you will be saved from death.
Dude, Live your life, travel the world, do things you like, enjoy your wealth! You deserve it!
Not into cod anymore but this one definitely hit home. Lot of memories tied up in those old cod days
Bye
Game came out and Scump said no shot of playing this for 2 seasons 😂 This years gonna be a hell of a ride 🔥 Hope the king gets a ring on his final season 🤝
These kinds of videos are always fkn cringe... Narcissism, much? Sayonara, carrot top. 🥕
What in the flying fuck is this algorithm?
The younger kids will never know. You were and always be a legend. Thank you.
Lmao see ya dweeb get a life and grow up
See you on the other side, you were my childhood, even tho I barely remember you, your still there in my heart, I’ll miss you, your going to be my favorite, memories are old, but your still there, as the days we get older people change, I’ll miss you.
I wish you told me to buy bitcoin 10 years ago instead of just playing game and teaching nothing about irl -_-
WHO GAF 😂😂😂 boy just quit nobody fkng cares. Bunch of simps
shedding grown man tears at work rn
22 years old now. My first cod was black ops 1. This hits us all. Thanks Scump!💯❤️
No
Crazy been watching since bo2
Wow, this could make a grown man cry. You just had to be there for all the great things bro has done over the years. One last time 🫡🫶🏽
Big Scump
Scump and Nadeshot will forever by my favorite pro Cod players. Their Bo2 And Ghosts teams will forever be legendary.
Scump thank u for giving me and my friends the best clips ever there is no better rusher then u
creative video. 🙌🏼
Man, been one hell of a ride. Loved watching you during your bo2 days. High school years with bo2 and you were something else man. GL, GG.
Is he serious? What will he do if he's not being a pro gamer?
It’s been 11 years man.. I have literally dreaded this day happening. All the memories are flowing so fast at once that I can’t help but cry rn.. god damn it man, it’s gonna take some time to get used to not hearing scump’s name on a cdl stream during events.
Yo yo yo  No one gives a shit
I love you scump!
My ye is good my daughters
Red Bull gives you wings…
If Peter Parker got bit by a Gaming Legend instead of a spider. I’d watch this movie!!!
Let's go Baby! ...we will miss you..soon enough..lets get u another ring!!!
Never Been This Depressed In My Entire Life….Cod Champs Wont Be The Same Without The King 👑
fantastic video. production was amazing. evoked my emotion. Optic Gaming is the greatest org. ever. I grew up with OG and I am proud to be a fan. best of luck to the future! :D
Scump we grew up with you. I speak for everyone when I say YOU THE GOAT.
Huge fan btw. I'm proud of you scump you lived the dream man.... ehhhhhh seeya<3
True staple of COD history.
The greatest professional cod player to ever exist. This will be an end of a era…
COD Legend Respect from Brazil
We will miss you😭😭😭
You carried this game on your back dawg! You were my mf' childhood. The reason I even thought about competing in cod. No matter what though ima always support my Goat in the cod scene! Love you bro! Coo won't ever be the same without you...
Scump retiring truly marks not just the end of an era but the end of my childhood. I started watching him in the beginning of middle school and by the time he retires I’ll be in 12th grade. Truly the greatest to ever do it no matter what happens this year. But hey, ONE MORE RIDE 😢
My whole body is covered in goosebumps, 15 seconds in.. love y’all ❤
I was in elementary school watching you for the first time and now I’m 20 starting my career. Thank you.
Bruh there is no sense about this choice, mw2 is literally kinda like the old cod games, the fact is that you were so "obsessed" by the old mechanics of mw2019 and now it feels weird, you just need to abituate again. Kinda hope it's real because if it's not it's just the same clickbait shit🤦‍♂️
😪 can't believe it.
Gonna miss you bro forever the goat
Dude…💔😞
Good luck with everything Sethy.. You’ve given us so much!! Thank you!!!
Won’t miss you, but congrats
This is heart whelming to watch. Congragulations on a long and successful career. You have been my favorite Call of Duty player since i discovered you during the Bo2 era. Enjoy the rest of your path Seth.
Former team player, new team owner?
WHOS THE BEST IN THE GAME
One last ride man it’s been a great journey! Sad to see ya go but glad I got to watch it
Who’s the best in the game!!!!
Thanks You Mr. Scumper

Grew up watching my boa and this was hard to hear! 4L Scumpy🫶
Damn Scump,  Thank you for everything, you are the face of Competitive Call of Duty as far as we're concerned.
I can't believe the time finally came. I hoped the day would never come when we see the King retire. Scumpii you have singlehandedly changed my whole childhood. I wish you nothing but the best in your future endeavors. #GREENWALL #Scumpii #SeeYaa
I feel so old
Man wth
Going to truly be missed ginga ninja wish you the best in what ever it is you do you are one hell of a cod player

Good you hella washed up bro

Wow where to start been watching scump since black ops 2, this guy is literally my childhood and teenage years. I feel weird saying this since I’m only 21, but what a journey you’ve been on scump, all us supporters want to wish you the best and good luck on future endeavours
Much love and respect!
GOD DAM LEGEND!
In my opinion he is the messi of cod 💚
End of a kings era, bear cod player ever to live.

The greatest of all time. Not gonna be the same without you, man.
Lookin forward to watching the KING rain one more time. It’s been a pleasure watching you. Thanks for making my childhood, and showing/introducing me to the competitive side of call of duty. You’re gunna forever be the KING 👑. Aaa See ya Seth ✌🏽
Let’s get it.. one last dance Scumpi !!!
There has to be a Call of Duty Hall of Fame and Scump MUST to be the first to be on it. #LongLiveTheKing
When you realize you’ve taken all the years for granted watching Scump. Dude grew up 30 mins from where I live in Southern Pennsylvania, same age, and I’ve been watching him tear it up since high school. One hell of a ride dude. Gg scump, gg 👑 🏆
Watching your videos and streams during COD Ghosts got me through my darkest times. Thank you Seth and much love
I’ve been watching you for 13 years. Thank you for everything, your vids and watching you compete for me through some rough times.
I’m so sad rn
love you scump, since 2011 boss <3 watchwed ur graduation live too in advanced warfare! <3 gotta watch you for this cod.. i ahvent plaeyd cod bcuz its dead, but many of you guys dont understand hes a legend
I am so glad I get to watch you play MW2 competitively. I have followed you since Ghosts. Congratulations on such an amazing career and thank you for the entertainment for years
Gonna miss the king 👑. Hopefully this last season will be in your and optics favor. Regardless I hope life after competitive cod is full of happiness and joy. 💚
Gonna miss the king 👑. Hopefully this last season will be in your and optics favor. Regardless I hope life after competitive cod is full of happiness and joy. 💚
Does this mean I have to stop too scump will be missed
I can’t even imagine watching competitive cod minus scump. This is sickening. 😢
Damn, this got me.
Made my childhood great. Here’s to the 🐐
El mejor por mucho !
Its so sad, as most of us grew up watching scump as a teen to an adult, but its a happy sad, this is life. And man its been a long run, we all want the past but never the future. Until the future is the past. Ahhh sshhhhyeaaa yah. ☹️💚💚🖤💚🖤💚🖤💚
😥😥
How he words it at the end is sus
Long live the king
You will always be the GOAT scump
Gonna miss you king
This was such a dramatic and cinematic goodbye that even I was getting sad, and I've never even seen this man a day in my life lol
Im crying 😔
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall never pass way.- the Lamb of God, who died for our sins and rose from the grave, Jesus Christ
I hope you’re just pulling a Tom Brady on us
#forscump
🎶🎵let it go....🎶🎵🎶 Let it Goooo. You have arrived to adulthood.   Now get a job!
Dont know why this in my feed for recommendations.  I dont play cod, dont watch anything related. I didnt even watch this video. Youtube is being bad. You on the other hand (based on the comments) be good, not to just to yourself but to everyone one you meet (as Mr. Rogers put it be a helper).
Man that is the saddest thing I’ve seen in a while
Named my son after you 🫶 you are the greatest cod player
So sad to hear that this will be your last year competing Seth but loved the content from start to finish bro. Long live the legend of Optic Gaming, Optic Scumpii. We all miss your energy brother❤️🥺💯
❤️
You’re delusional at this point Scump. I work 60 hours a week in hard labor to live in a crappy house, drive a crap car, and eat frozen food most of the time. You get to do your dream and live lavish, and you’re just gonna give it all up because you don’t feel like it anymore? I don’t feel like busting my back for 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, but it’s either show up to work, or be homeless and starve.
You deserve everything that’s come your way Scump.. been here my whole childhood … shout out to you for being consistent … much appreciation scump 🙏🏼miss them B02 days
GGS YA GOTTA WIN NOW
What futives said🥲🥲🥲
No Scump! My childhood.... my memories.... you will always be part of them brother. You've inspired me so much thru the years. I've been here through every event. The Pro scene will be lost without you.
Damn. What a ride
y’all writin paragraphs like if dis nigga died lol
i might cry
Wow seth i’ve been watching you since i was in middle school up until now in my early 20s. i’ve learned so much from watch your videos and watching you compete. it saddens me to see you retire. you were and still are the best. much love 💚
Like in all of the greats lives we learn they take the stage to then once leave it to watch the next generation prosper as they did and that’s the cycle that keeps it going. There would be less opportunity without people like you. You forever da GOAT much love brother 🥹💙
😥🐐
LOL, have no clue who he is.
love you scump
Only good things in your future ❤️ Big loves from Finland ❤️ Optic gaming follower always and forever 🤘🥰
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO DON’T DO IT TO US!
Your the reason I started playing call of duty it’s not goodbye it’s have a wonderful life in whatever you choose to do in the future going to miss the goat. Thank you for everything and all the great memories.
King Scump ❤❤❤
Grew up watching you from the start man, gonna sure miss watching you compete. The king of cod
I might cry on god, REALLY hope he gets a bunch of Ws this year, he deserves it.
Been watching the King since was a kid… seeing the old setups sitting next to each other almost brought a tear to my eye. Long live the King 🔥🔥
You did more then you’ll know for gaming man thanks for all the great clips you are truly one of the best to ever touch the sticks.
apart from cringey optic fans i really like seth.. have a good one champ..
Didn’t ask
You and drift0r ended this week, best of luck to you!
Noooooo
ngl a lil emotional, been a fan for a long ass time GGs tho, show'em all one more time what the term "goat" actually means
Although it’s coming to an end your impact will last forever
This is so crazy, especially reading all the comments. So many of us had scump and others as a legitimate part of our lives growing up. I’ve been watching him and other “original cod streamers” since around middle school. Seeing this video and reading all the comments really hits home the impact Scump had on cod. Sadly, it also shows how we are all growing up. Hope to see you kicking ass this year for the last year.
❤❤❤
It's hard for me to watch this video AND give it a thumbs up. That's the selfish side of how I feel about this being your last season in the league. The other side of me is happy to have been along for the ride (been here since 6050).   We love you, King Scump! Looking forward to your future in the scene. One last ride! 💚
The True GOAT 👑
Goat 🐐
this brought tears to my eyes im sure many people agree we grew up with scump
You and formal were the reasons I got into comp gaming especially cod thank u for all the amazing plays funny moments and so much more scump much love brutha ❤️🔫💚🍀🟩🟢🧪
Every one of us must go to champs to pay tribute to the king no if, ands, or buts about it.
SEEEEETH PLEASE GIEB US TWO MORE YEARS I ACTUALLY SHED A TEAR
Who even is this fella? Why is everyone in the comments crying?
The reason I started competitive cod, the reason I’m stopping bro 😢
Greatest player ever to play CoD.
Definitly one of the greatest players of all time.
Legends never die
The Messi in Competitive
The Goat 🐐🐐🐐
Started following you when you were just another name on MW3 GB leaderboard, watched you play champs as I graduated HS in 2014, and now I’m finishing a graduate degree in mechanical engineering. Thank you for being such a positive influence in my life and many countless others. I wish you the best with your future. Hope you continue to update the community with your life from time to time.
The end of Scumperjumper 🥹
You Will always be my Call of Duty Hero. Best moments of watching you play was back in 2014 Bo2 League play road to master. I was a middle school kid learning from the best. I remember making it to platinum rank 24. Waking up Saturday mornings To play league play while drinking a cold Mountain Dew. Thank you for making me a better player. 🥹🤝
I actually cried watching this 😭
You can tell Seth is trying not to cry this really meant so much to him, and too us all thanks for a great childhood man.
Gave me goosebumps watching this… Absolute fucking LEGEND so sad to hear you’re leaving the comp scene for CoD but excited to watch you perform this year :) ! Cheers Sethy
Scump since we're the same age, I feel like I grew up with you. Seems like we both went through struggles, the highs and lows over the years. So stoked for you on this decision, you'll be missed, but happy for your new adventure ahead!
Zlaner is cheating. Optic supports cheaters.
Cringe
Shame that the new blood won’t get to experience how much of a monster scump is/was. Truly the most known goat 😔🐐
The GOAT
💚
Who’s cutting onions in my room bro :((
greatest to ever touch a controller
Long live the king!

https://youtu.be/pS3-_71CWc4 this is the first video I saw from scump, after that is story…… I gonna miss this guy so much man omg, I’m crying right now writing this… one last dance for my king😭🖤💚
My inner child is so sad right now 😢
We were watching you like hawks for years…. Too many years passed all of us and now it’s your time. The History.. You’re legendary bro.
been watching this dude for 10 years lol sad day to see almost brought a tear to my eye
Man, hats off to whoever directed this video. What a video man!! One last ride!!
What does old comp gamers do when they realize they are to old to keep up? Go back to Uni? Commentary? Mc Donalds? IDk
Bye
Awesome video. Wish you the best of luck mate. Been watching you from the UK ever since your MW2 days and I was at school as a 15-year-old. I'm 25 now and this hits me in the feels. Can't wait for the final event!
Thanks for all the great entertainment and being a good role model in the competitive gaming industry
All love Seth! Wish the best for you and your future!
GOAT will be remembered in our hearts❤
I've been watching you for years don't leave now fam

What a great way to say I'm out! Not I can't find a team I'm retired it's I'm gonna try and go out a champ! Love it
One last ride man 💚
Since the age of 10 I have been watching you Scump, I am now 20 and it has been such a pleasure to watch you play COD the way you have. You are a demon on the sticks and you will forever stay a legend in the game. Thank you for everything Scumpii 💚💚💚

Who's cutting onions

Check this out tho NO ONE CARES
One last ride make it the BEST SEASON TO END
We are getting old thanks for a amazing career scump!

Goodbye
Whos crying 😅 oh me lol absolute legend
this sucks man, what an absolute banger of a career, can't wait for what's after this year.
Literally everything I learned about cod was from watching you play and making us believe that we can actually do this as a career you have inspired so many people you really changed our lives you might not know this but you have mad a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives throughout the years I’m in tears typing this shit because I know it won’t be the same anymore you are the GREATEST OF ALL FUCKING TIME King 👑
The greatest to ever do it

You're the reason im gaming now  Always the Goat still the Goat forever I knew this time is coming but I'm really sad  So true the gaming never will be the same without You 💚💚💚
Who cares
Dont blame you for hanging it up with the direction cods been heading these past few years. Casual cod is nonexistent these days and competitive is rough.
That means we will get some kick ass twitch streams cant wait
The fucking King !
Scump i grew up watching you for years compete and watching this just gave me chills with so many memories, you are a legend!!!
First it was pewds retirement from gaming, now this legend as well man 😢 everyone is growing and moving on with there lives, including us in the comments who have been watching these two kings in their element 🔥will be missed that’s for sure
I’m French. I was here at the ESWC Paris on AW. 5 years ago. I was so happy to saw you.  Thank you. My best children memories.
Amazing video, super nostalgic. Used to watch all Scump's vids throughout my teen years, now I'm 25 lmao. Congrats on an amazing career Scump
I’ve dreaded this moment since 2013 when I got into competitive CoD and became a massive Scump fan, I knew it would be soon but it doesn’t make it any easier, thank you for everything Seth you’ll never be forgotten 💚🤍
I’m only 21 and watched scump and bigtymer (daddy) Johnson retire 😢
Damn man didn’t have to make it that emotional 🥲
💚💚
Goodluck for the future forever my favourite competitive player
this made me really sad and i dont even watch cod anymore
Going to enjoy this one last time going to miss you Scump 💚
Probably my favorite entertainer
Damn. Hes not a kid anymore. I alleways saw him as this little child being the best call of duty player ever. I looked up to him and trough his eyes watching the game, in instance i felt like being a kid aswel. His storyline is what kept me young and innocent. But hes all grown up now. Even past that with the beard. He is 30 now and i am 30 aswel. The childhood is over. I never wanted this day to happen but we all gotta believe its here. Thank you for everything. It was 1 heck of a ride. Somehow i have this proud feeling now. Weird. God bless everyone.
I got goosebumps scump mann
ONE LAST DANCE!
cringe
Scump I’ve been watching you for over a decade since before the og og optic house you’re a legend this video gave me legit chills
Sad to hear SCUMP retiring after this year I learned a lot from watching him play cod

I've been watching Scump since 2011 and there have been a great amount of memories made. I appreciate the content you made over the years and will watch you to the end, thank you.
Damn ! That a sad ending of the OptiC History, I got chills to the legs watching this :(  The King of the GreenWall passing to another things.. holy molly.   I was like 13yrs back then when I 1st see Scump in CoD by friends of mine, taking the OG to the championship and he was a man on fire in theses stage everytime. i'm 27 now and still OpTic has always be my favorite team, and Scump have always be my favorite Player in that team. For real, with all respect.. you are the Wayne Gretzky of CoD Univers. One thing you should not forget Scump: We would never forget all the goods years you spend with us and thx you so much, we still hope to see you back there in some videos with the Old-OG even if it just time spending with the new team.
6050 Part was goated
This is crazy man. You were the first cod player i strted following all the content for and im positive you will go out with a bang. Excited to see a chapter end and another begin wish you all the luck in the world wven tho im sure you have the skill to take it all.
Scumper Jumper the penis pumper.... the King👑

Imagine taking your final breath and remembering all of this, the joy on the heart of all the people that was screaming your name on the top of their lungs, the doors you got too open for new generation of players and the inspiration too a lot of us that got too watch u on the big screen too make it same place as you, your not just a competitive player, your one of the 🐐
A true legend 👏.  You will be missed but never forgotten,  by far the best in my opinion.
Nadeshot, Crim, Formal, Big T, Teep, Karma, Boze, so many more too all the ogs are gone but you and Clay.....truly will be a end to a era.
sorry to here you go we will miss you
Noooooooo don’t go 😢😢 Congrats on an insane career now go out with a bang go get you another chip Goat!
im not crying, you're crying
Kings Never Die, Love you Scump. You were a massive part of my childhood. Watching your competitive play really helped me realize what it takes to be a champion in any aspect of life. Play your heart out this final year and enjoy your retirement!
I'm happy for you, but still sad to see you go. You have been my favorite to follow for years. I don't think watching the CDL will ever be the same. Enjoy retirement and I hope to see you creating content more often now!
good, now its time for call of duty to also say the same thing
It’s too soon 😢😢
In one word, this video can be summed up just like Scumps career, powerful.
nice reminder that we are all getting old. scump was my childhood now i’m 21 😤
Although we can all agree COD had definitely taken a downhill, most of us play because of what it used to be, and because if we we watch and who still plays. And I can speak for all of us I believe when I say you where one of the greatest call of duty inspirations of our generation. ❤❤
You’re legend bro thank you for the entertainment fucking legend
Ngl bro your the reason why I still play cod to this day 😢
Thank you Scumpy 🥲❤️ seriously, cannot thank you enough for the endless hours while growing up, you are the fucking man. This year will be legendary
Seth Abner, I don't know if you realize how emotionally invested some of your fans are not only of you, but of the Optic Organization as a whole. That video just got me in my feels and I know the ride can't last forever. I just want you to know, that I've followed your career man and am very impressed with what you have made it. You've been the face of optic to my household since 2013. I'm glad to have clicked on your content and glad I could support you over these last 9 years. We're going to miss you bro. #GREENWALL4LIFE
gl hf.
This is insane, I remember when they had to change the rules to let you compete in MW3/BO1 now 11 years later you’re retiring. Thanks for helping millions through entertainment, congrats GOAT
Man, you honestly changed the game forever! COD & the Leauge will never be the same without you bro! Nothing but love baby.
legend!
That shot at 1:38 was absolutely incredible. Who ever idea that was, genius
Good bye whoever you were
I'm not an optic fan. But that made me tear up. Respect to you champ and the empire you built and are leaving in your wake. Every cod pro that walks the stage today owes you thanks for paving the way for the call of duty competitive league. I hope it starts to return to its grass roots. It just hit different back then.
Damn... I never thought that I'd be getting this old this fast... Much like a lot of the comments here Scump, it's incredibly sad and hard to believe that this is the end of an era. I remember there was a time in highschool when the nightly routine would be getting home, turning on my PS3, firing up COD and watching your videos in between rounds and lobbies while I played. I'm 28 now and can usually only find time to play a few hours here and there, but I still find myself watching your videos weekly. Thank you for everything you've done for the COD community and for gamers like myself; all the best in whatever path you take Scump and we will never forget ya ❤️ Big ups to ya brother!!
Literally one of the best players to ever do it. Loved watching your videos growing up. I don't play cod anymore but I'll always remember watching you and trying to replicate it. Loved the memories , wish you well in love brother. #TeamOptic
Crazy bruh. Basically grew up with you Scump, we essentially the same age. Seeing you completely dominate year after year, I’m so happy for you brother. You’re a TRAILBLAZER in this space. You deserve everything man.
No one cares
him and attach cut from the same god cloth
imagine having parents that actually gave a shit about you when growing up..
Me: *reads tittle  Also me: NOoooOoo
Absolute chills 🐐 🙏
Omg. I cried actually. Scump I grew up going through middle school and high school watching you wanting to be you…I’m 21 now and seeing you leave just tells me I’m grown. Nostalgia. Make this year count pls.
This is actually surreal. This man is the one who introduced me into cod pretty much with the first video I saw of him on YouTube and watched and played every cod the whole way. Now he’s done pro and half the kids that grew up watching him play hardly play anymore. Sad life but glad to know he’s gonna finally go do whatever he wants.
It’s so sad, but you’re leaving the king!! Never forget
💚
This had me in tears 😭
I'm a fucking cry
The face of call of duty will never be forgotten! 💚
🥹🥲😭 " Los héroes son recordados, pero las leyendas nunca mueren " I You love scump
Mw2 just dropped 😢
Fuck… I have literally grown up watching Scump. I knew this day would be coming but I wasn’t ready.
😢
I almost cried
Damn what a video 😢 king scump
The GOAT and it’s not close!
Damn….
I'm not crying, you are
GG
Rip cod. Haven’t known comp cod without him.
One last run. Let’s go big dawg
This is the Kobe of COD 😅
Its been an honor to watch you over the years ever since Bo2 and even before that a little, I will never forget discovering twitch and just watching you and nade and the road to 100 wins in Bo2. Hell of ride brother its been nice enjoying it
Scumpy my boi you just made me feel old in 2 short minutes
Really glad Nadeshots name made it into this. I got chills when I heard the skorpion cross map game from bo2.
sad to see you go king. grew up wathing your youtube videos and streams. one last ring for the king?
one of the goats, if not the goat. atleast he did it right, some of these streamers leave their fans wondering what happened and never hear from them again.
GOAT
I started fucking balling my eyes out. I fucking love you scump. Thank you for making dark times sweet. You will always hold a huge part of my heart. This isnt goodbye, its just a see you later king🤍

💙💙💙
The GOAT. U made me love competitive cod.
Tell me why I’m 26 and almost sat here and almost cried 😂! Love your vids dude see you round!
One of the not many no cheating skilled players. Now we've got fake streamers left mostly. Too bad.
It’s time to retire from competitive Call Of Duty side. Game isn’t going to improve its going down hill. Lost online player base count in game since Bo3. It’s now cross plat form that proves COD is failing. Just become a pub stomper live streamer bring back losing games to a win would be more fun to watch.
🐐
Broooooo.
🥺🥺
Yea my days watching competitive COD is over. Thank you sethy for the amazing years. I was like 10 or 12 when I first started to watch cod now im 22
One of the greatest will be leaving competitive COD; but just think about the content that will be coming. Lets go Scump 💯 ps. huge congratulations on your engagement 💍
61k likes and not a single dislike 👏🤌
😭😭😭😭
Scump was my child hood I love you peace bro love from aus
Sad day to humanity
Hearing the Let’s Go Optic chant and seeing the setup from the old optic house just gives me chills.
Gives me chills watching this 😢 You got me into call of duty and I’ve pretty much watched you for half of my life! Thankyou for everything you did for the community scumpy your legacy will live on forever!!
This actually gave me chills. You're the ONLY person I've watched religiously. I learned everything i know about cod from you. The cod scene is going to change tremendously once you are done. You will forever be the goat! Much love Scumpy & thank you for all the great years of entertainment!
I am officially getting old, it was a pleasure watching you over the years!   Truly one of the best the game could have ever had, thanks for making my younger days so great & start of love for COD.
It’s sad to see you go but like all great things must come to an end and thank you for the most Electrified experience of watching you play though out your career and thank you for turning me best player I could ever be😁😁
Ahhh see ya 😢

Love watching you play. end of a journey growing up
Do you think you will be apart of call of duty in anyways? Like coaching or management of some kind?
This hits different when you been playing cod since world at war, watching scump and the pro scene since cod ghost, and joining the pro scene as a SND player on cod ghost and officially getting a name playing agaisnt pros, but then I stopped playing after cod bo3. You’ll be missed scump, never stop making content though. Rip phizzurp!

Thank you for all the memories Scump. You was a huge inspiration to me and too so many other people around  the world and you put a huge effect on me in my childhood. This vid brings back flashbacks of watching you play Black ops 2 and 3 back in 2012 back when I was 13 years old and now I'm 23. The time went by so fast.

Thanks for all the memories Scump. Saw you frying kids in Bo2 with the scorpion, live. Been watching since i was a kid. Feels like I know you a little bit. Favorite player of all time, the GOAT. Optic Scumpi.
... im 27 and I planning on getting married in a year.. i feel this.. our time is passing guys, the lobbies are empty, the group chats are quiet, and its no longer our time to play games.
The goat ❤️💔
Is it weird that a big piece of my life feels like it’s finishing with you?

You’re the reason some of us even follow competitive cod…even the reason some of us play. Love you scump, one last ride baby 🤞🏻🤙🏻
Damn dude… but at least it’s a decent cod to end it on🙌🙌🤷‍♂️
Scump will always be in my eyes the best slayer to ever pick up a pad 💚🖤  #ScumpisGOAT 🐐

I thought you was moving to a halo pro team at first when I seen the Xbox and Halo 2 on screen
The GOAT
Sad face. The end of an era.
Change is good scump, thank you for All the years of Entertainment. the badass montages, and amazing personality. I know where ever you go to next you’ll have the support of your fans much love big UPS GGS M8!**
Damn..
Beautifully shot and edited. Truly end of an era
Seth you were apart of my childhood and I loved watching all of your competitive cod videos when I was a teenager. You are THE best cod player to ever play in the pro leagues!! It’s hurts my heart that this is your last year but you did have a very successful career😢 I love you Seth and I hope whatever’s next it’ll bring you even more success😢❤
Cringe is an understatement
This gave me the chills..
Congrats man! It’s been a hell of a ride!!!!
💪🏽💪🏽
no one can argue scump is the goat but damn there's some dickriders in this comment section
Still hurts even though all of us knew this day would come, you're the reason I even got into the comp scene of cod. Happy I got the chance to see the prime ginger ninja. Bring us home one last chip, one last dance for the GREENWALL. End of an era, enjoy this last season king.
I am saying the same like rest of others. I have followed scump since BO2 times. Its heartbreaking but life goes on...
Been a fan since the beginning & this actually made me tear up bros. It’s a been a long ride. Thank you for the grind Scump!

It’s been fun watching you 😢
Crazy man. A true idol and legend for so many of us growing up. Been watching since the MW3 days. End of an era for competitive Call of Duty, no doubt.

Nooo… I’m so unbelievably sad. I love you Scumpii ❤️
Rip…. Love you sethy. Huge part of my childhood. Tears rolling after this one…..
The competitive scene will never be the same thanks for all the memories ❤ #greenwall
Sigh 😔 it always comes to an end
What hurts the most about things like this, is we are growing up. And phases of our lives are changing, and no matter how much we want to hold on to them, life moves on. You and Nade were a huge part of my teens. I’d come home from school and watch your latest YouTube videos for hours to pass the time. The commentary, the game play, the optic house. Thankfully those videos still exist for the memories.
Who’s the best in the game?!
This video was soo coldddd
😢😢😢. I always wished to never see this day. Will always remember you Scump. You and Nadeshot made me love COD even more. Got hooked on to your channel when I started playing BO2 during my school days. Will miss you heaps❤️👑
This dude was my entire childhood. Thank you for the memories Scump!!! We all love and appreciate you! Wish you the best in your next chapter! We will always be here! ✌🏼
😢😢😢. I always wished to never see this day. Will always remember you Scump. You and Nadeshot made me love COD even more. Got hooked on to your channel when I started playing BO2 during my school days. Will miss you heaps❤️👑
Well this will be the last year I watch pro cod ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best player of all time. No one compares. Thank you, for being in my childhood !
Goodbumps the whole video.  Going to miss you bro.

Thankyou scump, like many others you made my childhood too, I can only hope you continue to play and stream casually but thankyou again for being the best that did it

Thanks king
So bummed but happy for you at the same time
A true legend of the FPS world
Excellent video my friend

Put my man up in the esports hall of fame.  If there is one idk. If there isn’t then make one and put my man in it
SCUMP NOOOOOOO
Grew up watching scump and Ali-a
Good shit bro appreciate you

Congrats on all your success and best of luck in your next venture. Thanks for all the memories
Scump's last dance
see ya bud
Goosebumps, all those memories, what a personality and humor!! Let’s get add more crazy memories and another ring to your huge LEGACY! You are the GOAT!!
What an absolute legend of a player. I literally grew up with him. I wish him all the best for his future endeavours.
I figured it was your last year. But this video freaked me the fuck out thinking you were saying u were done as of now. Wow that almost really sucked.
This gave me chills bruh
When someone says competitive cod, I jus start to think in scump being a monster in a hardpoint.
Inabit la
Been a good ride Scump you truly are the G.O.A.T over 10plus years I've watched you dominate at the highest level, i give you your flowers KING!
Lets get this one last time kill it my friend 💪🏻
Appreciate the memories scump 🐐😢
I’ve watched Scump for 10+ years now. He has always been my favourite Optic member. The energy and hype he would bring to every match, every game, every win, every trashtalk and every tournament. I’ve watched every single one of his videos. His older videos I would binge watch sometimes because it would be nostalgic.. Optic will never be the same without him. I really hope he stays on as a content creator and still makes Call of Duty content. Much love to you brother and I wish you the best in your journey🙏🏼💚💚💚
I was a kid when you guys moved to the OpTic House and I watched you everyday dreaming about becoming a Pro player/Youtuber one day. I'm 23. Many memories came back watching this video.  Thank you, really.
Let's go out in style scumpi, great editing, hard to not make you emotional.. there will never be another like the king, what a run, lets go optic
There's no debate in anyones mind about who is greatest competitive call of duty player off all time!
Damnnnn 😢
Your still the goat, i barley care about COD anymore but you and crimsix will always be my favorites. Been watching since middle school and now I’m out of college. Thanks for the ride !
Why?
Why the production on this was better than some movies out right now.
Good luck this year. You deserve to go out on top and can't wait to see what you do next.
Shut up I’m not crying, you’re crying 😢
I’m not crying you are 😢
fuckin sick video
yo sign futives
Good for you man, go love your life
I wish I could tell you how much you mean to me and the childhood you gave me
Ripped to shreddss man. All the sound bites took me back through the memories of watching you and the team moving from house to house and kill the competitive gaming scene. Thank you.
I guess it's 'uhhtheeya' for good then 👋
you the man Scump sad to see the best CoD Comp player leave but you have given some of the greatest moments and years to the CoD community and the OpTic Franchise you deserve closure and a good A$$ break thank you for getting me into CoD and inspiring me to game this is to a real one !!!
Best Cod player of all time. Put some respect on this man’s name. 👑☢️🔫
Damn, this hit me hard in the feels. COD will never be the same again. There can be only one 👑! You changed the game you changed content and combined a level of creativity, humor, and the highest level of skill the game has ever seen. IMO there is no other esports / content creator with your unique skill set. Thank you for the memories the laughs! I especially loved the words and phrases you’d make up when you were hyped or talking smack. “Let’s gooo sonny””you got schmongbonged”😂 to name a few! Enjoy the fruits of your labor. I truly hope you continue content if you feel like it’s the right path for you. Much love my guy! You’re a legend Scump and one of a kind. - drudey (one of your biggest fans) ♥️ P.S your animal tee shirts are 🔥
First crim now scump end of a cod era
Goodbye king, you will be missed, this year will be a good year for the green wall I can feel it #brickbybrick
one last ride king!
Wow this was so hard to watch, but what a beautiful video scump. I don’t wanna believe you’re retiring but all good things must come to a end. 😔😔❤❤
Sbmm ruined this franchise
I still remember watching sweatbannin 88-0 like it was yesterday.
Alas…. One last DANCE…. Scump, make it count buddy….   Much respect to your decision for leaving professional COD tournaments after a decade of nothing but hardcore gameplays from the GOAT himself..!! We will miss you deeply Seth, we all will…. This is OUR thank you for being our idol for so many years…. You inspired us to be better cod players and push us to where we wanna be….  Thank you, and may god bless you on the road Seth..!!
Thank you for everything and I wish you nothing but the best for the future ❤
My heart can’t take this damage.
Just want to say as a 12 year old I joined a quick scope clan and we did a bunch of stuff. Tried the competitive didn't go far. But you were one of our main inspirations. If it wasn't for you I wouldn't even play cod the way I do. Love you man
Talk about chills...Good Game Well Played Scumper Dumper
Optic won't be the same without you king. Let's get that chip so nobody can argue against Scumpi being the 🐐
💚
A big big part of my childhood right there! Ive known you since that competition match in Havana Bo1 with the golden Famas❤️ Thank you for everything ScumperJumper
Oh this video touch me, i mean SAD but this is life i hope u stay in the industry especially with optic. And good luck in ur life 🎉
Welcome to youtube gaming
Damn you know I didn’t think I would ever see the day
God bless legend 🙏
That was sooo fukin sick!!
Thank you. 16 year old Scumperjumper changed my life. Thanks for letting us watch you grow. One last ride 💚
Love u, man!
About she’s a tear
no way my dude, such a shame, but all good things come to end
Thank You King! 💯💚🤴
When I say this man is why I became better at cod and play hype brooooo
💔
The Return of the KING, for one last time!!!!!
This was my 13th reason.   I saw the Scump movie when I was 12 after saying I’d never play an fps game, and from that moment everything in my life has been CoD. Don’t know what I’ll do without you. Guess I’ll have to root for Larew…
wont be the same without u. <33
Man, been watching you since Bo2 and now im 25 and youre retiring 😢😢 we will miss you!  Almost shed a tear when you were “watching yourself” as you won!
LOVE YOU BROTHER. YOURE THE REASON I STARTED.
The crowds better go wild this season! Cod scene won’t be the same without you, get that ring champ 🎉
THE GOAT
The undertaker of cod
Growing up feels weird. I’ve watched Seth since I was 12 and now he’s almost done. It’s been a pleasure my friend
Watched your comp since ‘13 ghosts … chills
Omg I used to watch you back in Bo2 as a kid no way all the people I’ve watched growing up, you were the one person from Optic I watched.I guess we’re all growing up😔
IM NOT CRYING YOURE CRYING
Thank goodness it's one last year. After this year I will not be watching competitive cod
Its been a pleasure watching and learning from the G.O.A.T. Best of luck in your future endeavors.
End of an era 😔
Ur an inspiration love u❤️
❤️
You are the BEST!
Helluva career to date, man... I'm gonna soak up every second I can this season. I can still remember coming across your channel for the first time years ago... I think you had barely reached 300k subs back then, but I could be wrong. It was definitely well short of 1 Million. But PTSD is a bitch and these days my memory's not so sharp being on the wrong side of 40. You changed the game with how you've had such longevity simultaneously competing at the top of the game and being one of the most ambitious and consistent content creators across all the gaming world. Lots of laughs watching your channel over the year, lots of ups and downs watching the roller coaster OG has endured throughout all these years I've been a fan. But all journeys take new directions eventually. Enjoy the ride this year and best of luck with your next steps. You're one of the best things to ever happen to CoD. You're a freaking legend brother.  Go forth and fry. I hope you and the boys get yourselves a couple more chips.
Plz keep posting 🐐 the comp side of cod will never be the same ❤
This is goodbye... In 12 months.
😔🎮👑
🥲
Im speechless... lets get these tournaments
Won't ever be the same
It's a sad time blessed with beautiful memories. ❤️ TY SCUMPERJUMPER.
Competitive COD is done
"sthee ya" 😢
I love you scump and ur entire team you ran with ever since mw2/mw3 GBs. You’re a Hero to many and a legend to all. Love you

Scump the beginning and the end of CoD You will always the king
U broke my heart
Fr gonna miss this shit
pay my respects to legend
We still got a whole year!!! Lesssss go baby. You will be missed when the time comes. 🎉❤
One more round !!!

Damn......
Wow, how relevant these moments are is insane. Crazy how my gaming life has kinda coincided with scumps. All of them clips hit hard. You were the master, go out with a bang brother
Ya ok.
Even though im not much of a COD player anymore, you were one of my childhood pillars for gaming. Me and my cousin always watched you and admired the way you play. Thank you for years of fun, cant wait to see what you do next!
LETS DO IT 🐐
Scump is cod .... i never played cod on a competitive level im from the halo side but we all knew scump after seeing snipe leave and now this is like shit it is really the end of and era .........   Legend never die   Green WALL
The GOAT, you have no idea how much of an impact you have as a call of duty player, end of an era
Goosebumps…
such a great video down memory lane
End of an era
Wow amazing career you’ve had GOAT!! Your are an absolute legend in the COD scene. Congratulations on amazing career and good luck on what life brings you next.
You are the goat
Let’s go one last time GREENWALL been here since bo2 cwl teared up watching this
GG Scumpy!
I cried watching this! Wtf lmao. Good luck and thanks Sumpi
Damn bro been watching since we were both kids…. Sweatbannin baby!!
This hit hard
Very sad moment Seth, I’ve watched you from day one, watched you grow into the best call of duty player, I would be lying if I said I don’t shed a tear watching this, well done lad, and see you on the flip side, this is optic Seth going dark…..
Enough to make a grown man cry
I'm hoping you find some happiness and success man in whatever it is you choose to pursue. Much love and respect to the 👑
The King Retired
Absolute Pain.
I sit here in mild disbelief reading a green sea of personal accounts highlighting what Seth has done for people. It just makes me smile, plain and simple. This giant community formed over the majority of many of our life's. Many in this community going through extreme tribulations and personal struggles with but one constant. Scump. He was there day in and day out providing exactly what you may have needed that one day that was just a little harder than the rest. Man I'm still struggling to wrap my head around the true scale of the journey. Thank you Seth and to everyone else I'm happy you're here! 💚
I’ve been watching you since I was 11 years old man, you were such a big part of my childhood and looking up to you and playing games probably kept me out of a lot of trouble and helped me throughout growing up just distracting me from normal life. Thank you for being unapologetically you whether it’s on camera or off, you are forever an inspiration. You & OpTic have given me some great memories over the years win or loss I’ve been through it all the whole way! Will support you on whatever it is you do after competing, best of luck this year and hopefully you go out with a bang and win the big one this year 🍀
Respect, made a lot of people happy in dark times I’m sure
Love ya Scumpii!!! One last dance baby!!! GGs Greenwall4Life
im not crying....YOU crying
Yo call me soft or whatever, but I actually teared up and got that I might be sick right now feeling in my stomach. Truly from the bottom of my heart and I'm sure many others thank yall for putting in all the time and effort into building this whole thing. Not just being pros and trying to be the best teammate but for all the content year after year to build this whole community we have. I really wish more pros looked at the game like yall did and showed the true passion and love behind what  yall wanted this game to become. * Moment of silents for the COD community*
come back for mw3 at least to make a full circle🙏
The music the memories 😢

The goat. Preciate all the hard work you put in and the legacy you left behind is legendary in every community
Scump, I’ve grown with you, aged as you aged, and watched one hell of a career in the process. Your decision to retire from competitive Call of Duty is respected and you’re in the history books. Godspeed

Scump will always be the king of competitive cod
I love you scumpy. I was like 13 when I started watching your videos. I’m 21 now in college and you and optic gaming was a big part of my YouTube childhood. Thank you for all the great content. I’ll always remember the classic nuclear bo2 videos.
I blame Nadia I just hope pamaj ain’t next
GOAT

After this it’s time for scump to partner with nadeshot. Optic is the life but nadeshot is the partner.

Insane video! Who ever thought of the idea for this video is a genius!!

It’s been so much fun watching you play! You’re the reason I started watching competitive cod, and I can’t wait to watch the content you’re gonna start posting more frequently after a good season and a well deserved break after that❤ You will always be The King of CoD.

I am legitimately sad... This man has been there my whole time growing up. From middle school to my career now, it's just insane the run he had. There will never be anyone like him. I definitely need to go to an event this year.

Once a king always a king .

I’ve grown up watching scumpy since 2009. This man has lived my dreams. He did it. This was an awesome video. It’s like, look where we started, what we’ve done, how far we’ve come. Now our time has come. Love the journey bro.
No way man been watching you dominate since black ops 2 thanks for all the memories king
Every morning since I was a kid  I open YouTube and you was there man taking my morning giving me the best vibes of cod , that’s not a good bye my guy 😑
Tears came down my face watching this, I don’t know if it was because I invested so much time watching the optic guys and playing comp but this is truly crazy to see. The king will never be gone, he’s in our hearts and all the great memories will live with in us for life. Thanks for making my child hood so special.
The memories watching you and OpTic I have is unreal, thank you Scump!
what a ride, have watch you since 2013 and what can i say, enjoyed every minute of it! teared up just watching this with so many memories!  one last ride, lets make it a good one! my fellow ginger bro, THE GOAT 💚
THE BEST IN THE WORLD
All I can say is thank you Scump. Been a fan ever since BO2 and followed you every step of the way. 10 years of being a fan. The game and esport we love wouldn't be here without you. GOAT.
👑
I was fighting tears and smiling
The one and only reason I still play this franchise and keep up with it, Scump a true legend to the community providing so many memories. To those like myself who could experience his whole career be thankful for the moments we were able to witness as there will never be someone quite like the king. Thank you Scumpii❤️
CoD is over.
Thanks for everything scump
Thank you for all the great memories seth 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 never will stop being my fav pro

Good luck my friend
Leaving an epic era behind you MR. Scump! Almost everyone in the comments has been thru this with you… Thank you!
GOAT
absolut legend ❤️
Another year is still insane, most people would have been done but you have beaten expectations many times. Over and over again and I can't wait to see what you have in store for your final year
The GOAT of COD, I’ll never forget the old days of cod, thank you Scump ❤
Damn, been watching you since you were in high school man. Now you’re all grown up and retired. Congrats on a great career!
The best that ever done it.   Thanks scumpy 💚

I'm fucking dreading watching this right now. 😥
The Ginger farken Ninja ladies and gentlemen 🫡
Well i didnt need this. SO depressing l0l
im not crying your crying😢😢😢 this is a sad time in the Call of Duty community
Man i use to sleep watching scump play through my astros. Mw3 GBs were epic, bo3 pub stomps all night wake up to the shit playing. Unreal. Ill probably never watch competitive COD anymore.
We need a scumpii end of era card on fifa 23
you will always be remember , i will show the kids how goated you were whole career <3
Why bro why?!?😢
Such a sad time like many i have grown up following OpTic & Scump & all the boys & we all new this time was going to come but still don't make it any easier knowing we will no longer be able to tune into the CWL or anything like that & watch OpTic Scump & the rest perform magic like they have on so many times i wish you the best for you future Scump & Call of Duty CWL will never be the same again. 😢😭💚
The end of an cod legend 😶‍🌫
Lame
THE GOAT!!
That’s all that was said that had me like confused asf at first ngl but damn cod ain’t ever gonna be the same competitive wise without Scumpii
👑
BigT=The goat Scumpii= King Who will rise to the challenge to fill the shoes of these two CoD Giants.  Side Note: Seth "scump" Abner, thank you from all of your fans for bringing us tears of victory, tears of defeat, and the will to never back down. You as well the rest of optic have inspired generations of Gamers to be our best. Rest well KING rightfully deserved
I dreaded the day this would happen...
smart move, call of duty has gone to shit. the games are no longer fun to play and that's base of anything related to gaming, the game needs to be fun. i'm surprised you could bear it this long, but there's no need to go down with the ship.
Been following you since that mw3 hardhat ak47 gameplay ronaldinho showcased you with. You’re the GOAT frfr
got teary watching this, you’ll forever be a legend. i’ll miss watching you every year
CAP! 🗣️🗣️
We love you scump! Thank you from all of us.
Bro you had me for a second I thought this was it! There is No reason you can’t be the Tom Brady of COD. Follow your heart tho
We are officially old boys
GOAT
Damn bro, competitive cod just took the biggest hit ever.  BOW DOWN!
I had a feeling this was coming after watching the process. Seth I can't thank you enough for all of the memories and for carrying the green banner on your back for all these years. I always knew this day would come but it still hurts to see it. One last dance, one more chance. Forever the King.
I deadass cried…
I want to fckin cry right now bro.
With next gen consoles and a new call of duty. While also having a child and a more than full time job I also decided to retire from COD. Thank you for being a part of my childhood . Could you please find optic preditor for me
Good luck! Hope you end it in a bang
You’re my childhood , you’re the best (the goat) thank you we all love you
theeyuh <3
The Best to ever entertain the COD comp community. Remember starting watching you since the Bo2 day, what a carrer you’ve had. CoD como would not be the same without you Seth.💚🖤
Just here crying in the club
Was on the edge of my seat! One last round for the King!
My heart feels broken and I've got tears in my eyes.
The last Dance 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
Man i miss scump in bo2 i think im gonna watch him again
He's trolling it's good marketing scheme to make people watch.
The nostalgia 😢. I often times get the same feelings when looking back at older games I've got that I just can't play anymore. this is a very powerful video with a strong meaning to LIFE itself. Meaning that ALL GOOD THINGS COME TO AN END. I'm gonna miss you out there. Hopefully u make loads of content 4 us on YouTube still.
Grazieee 💚  by Italian
You really made my childhood days ❤️ I knew this day would come eventually congratulations 🐐
I’m going to miss you. Thankyou
Best scump, I follow you’r story , sinds black ops 2 , I have become a better player myself because of you’r settings , and ofcourse of you’r video’s , you can only learn from the best and you and Crimsix where the best , thanks for all the wonderful time’s you gave us , wish you good luck this year and in the future
GOAT since the mw3 days I’ve been watching I’ll never forget ya Seth. Best of luck with everything and I’ll be watching your last tournaments this season supporting you.
The faze v optic rivalry back in the day was a big part of my childhood and was what got me into cod, Thank you
All I've known is Scump. This is depressing to see the King hang up the sticks in terms of competitive cod. Fxckn Goat
The only king that cod ever had, one last ride scumperjumper
Ayo?
Good luck man… the French fan
No!
Damn.... knew it was coming but still hurts man
Long live the king.
My boy got married and saw what brady is going through after choosing to do what he loves and said im out after this year😂🫶
Can we appreciate the production and staff effort that was put into this, nobody does it like the greenwall 🤝
Champions win trophies, but your more then that Seth.  You are a champion of winning the hearts & minds of thousands of fans.  I will miss you on the main stage, good luck for the future 👏 👑
bro this got me so sad fr
The best of the best right there Scump is inspiration of Call of duty
Sethy the 🐐
You will always be remember as KING my man.
Sad day. Thanks for all you've done seth
wow
Not like this. I grew up with Scumpii on Scumpii videos. Seeing him retire hurts a little extra cause it's the fear we all have deep inside. Father time stops for no one, one day we'll all put down the controller for the last time. What a run it will have been.
Im happy to say ive watch you since you posted a video called “Swearbannin” and i will continue to watch you with whatever your content shall be 😊 one last GG Scump
Forever an idol thank you 💚
Feelsbad to see everybody retire, cod will never be the same... you wil be missed scump
One last ride!
Good old Black Ops 2 times. Damn, I miss these days so much
knows he’s gonna get shit on
Thank you GOAT. For every Moment.
This feels like LeBron announcing his retirement. Scump is the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be, truly. This final season is gonna be one for the history books because you KNOW he is gonna give it his all, cannot wait to watch history 👏🖤
Legend
Love you scump
Man the optic gaming era scump and nade last rodeo boys love you scump 🤠🤧
):
Can’t believe your leaving us 💔
😢
Im not crying, you are! :(
king scump for ever 💯
You're impact to the COD scenes will always be remembered and cherished #Greenwall
All good things must come to an end. Scumps the reason I started watching competitive cod. Let's go out with a bang. It's the greenwalls year the king will reign supreme
"Getting cross map kills with the scorpion"   Will forever be a iconic quote and game play
Damn… right in the feels
I can't even type I'm in a glass cage of emotional rage
much love bro <3
I began highschool. Finished highschool. Started college. Finished college. Got a girlfriend. Got a wife. Found a career. Worked and built my reputation within the industry. This man has been a part of my piece of release through all of it. Thank you scump, and I wish you as good of a life as you have unknowingly walked alongside me through.
All I can say is thank you very much. We will generously enjoy his last season.  Even though his time is over, we will forever remember his passion and courage for CoD. We will remember him again and again every time we play this game....Scump,KING!
Fuck u seth im crying now❤️
Scump ❤️❤️❤️ Our childhood hero 🥰
End of the Scump saga, we’ll miss you legend.
Definitely the most iconic Cod player and arguably the best one too ! Cod will never be the same ! Thanks for all the moments scump remember watching you back in Bo2
I had a feeling this was coming after the initial talk about retirement
Noooo
this litteraly broke my heart💔. You were my day 1 inspiration. I am watching you since i was very young and i never watched someone who had this good vision in the game. Thankyou very much for the content you made. You're retirement is well deserved!❤
Want to dislike so bad. All the best Scump my boy!
Sadest video in cod history.. made me cry..
Amazing video. King Scump forever
Bro why am I crying. The end of an era for sure. Scump you have been many of our child hoods and we love you.

If infinity ward and sledgehammer keep releasing shitter games then everyone is gonna retire lmao. MW2 is an L
Best announcement for an absolute legend. You are a major inspiration to me and see to you that happy at the end of such a long road is truly fulfilling. Thanks king.
Makes me sad I spent so many days and years watching you farewell Scumpii my favorite gaming competitor
Most loved CoD pro of all time ❤
Made me tear up, honestly end of an era, been wathcing from the begining as a kid and now gonna see the end as an adult, just showed me how life goes by fast and we dont realise it. Enjoy your retirement you have worked hard for it , you are irreplaceable, thank you for making my childhood amazing. Gonna miss seeing you play for Optic. Now gotta hold the rest of tears for next year💚💚💚
Once the man saw the map design and squad spawns he knew it was wraps
Legit got chills watching this .. the game will never be the same .. thank you for everything you’ve done
The GOAT
hop on apex big guy the pro community will take you in with open arms
Bit dramatic stump come on dude
One last dance get it King 👑
🐐
You’ve been such a big part of my life Scump, no exaggeration. Seems crazy to say but having watched someone religiously for this many years on YouTube, and supporting them in comps (hard work at times 😂), I guess it’s natural. Thank you man, for everything. You are the king. Let’s go out on a high brother
Scump I love I have loved you forever congratulations brother I’m an army soldier and always loved watching you play I’m sure you’ll be great in your next chapter in life brother congratulations again I’m so happy to see you grow
Rip scump😭😭
New door opens up. “Welcome to the old me of optic”
Good luck buddy!
Legit grew up watching this man become the king I'm 28 and maaaan what a ride
Damn! The end of an era. Crazy growing up with you scump!
Ya done good kid, ya done good 🥲
But he'll still pub stomp? Right?
Go get one last ring goat!
Legend
Want to step into your shoes as the flex lead player role when I learn how to get there
Thank you for my childhood Seth
I remember during black ops 2 me and my friend played scump and Matt in a league play match. I still have a clip from that game I got a 3 piece I was way too proud about 😂 Back in the glory days when we used to play 8 hours a day after school lol. But that was a game I’ll remember forever cuz I played with the COD GOAT. I didn’t watch a lot of competitive but I always followed scumpy. Haven’t watched competitive cod in 5+ years but will watch a scumpy video every now and then. I’ll always be a fan. Thanks for all the great memories.
I was hoping this day will never come, but i wish you the best, i hope this year will be the best year of your career, love you and will always support you!
Wow this hit me hard! One of the best to ever do it! Thanks for all the years of content scump!
started his professional debut with mw2, ending with mwii. what a ride it has been.   long live the 👑❤️
My guy!!!!!!!!!!
Can't put my emotions into words.. GG scump. Time to live life and enjoy it with friends and family. #OneLastRide
This made me almost cry, You were a true beast! I've been watching since I was 15, I remember the one and only time I played with you on BO3 and I couldn't believe it I thought it was a fake account and you also made a video with me in it, I have never played against someone so good in COD you made me rage lol you dominated that game. I wish the best for you after retirement!
I miss the black ops 2 gun game days bro. simpler times
Greatest of all time. Hands down. Thank you for all the memories ❤️
Actual legend
Nobody will ever be better than scump 💯
Farewell king! I’ll never forget those bo1 and bo2 days that I grew up on 😭 wish we could all go back to those time. Hope you enjoy whatever life brings you next
Flip me, the hairs on my entire body just stood up after that. I have to be honest, once Scump is gone, I don't think I'll have any urge what-so-ever to watch COD again. I grew up with you, I grew up with your live comms, I grew up watching you grow up in the OpTic house, I grew up screaming at my monitor cheering for you - there is no other eSports player who will ever be on the same shelf you are - the pioneer. THE King.
Long live the king 👑 I’ve NEVER teared up at ANY athlete retiring until now. Thank you for making my childhood Scump. Much love ❤️
wow… the absolute best player of all time.
Thank you King Scump!😢
Scump🥺❤️❤️❤️
The green wall!!
The world is over
A legend forever, you changed the game and you are a icon. Grew up watching you play best to ever do it! Thank you Seth one last ride
The greatest to ever do it. Grew up watching you and you have been a huge inspiration ever since. Love you 💚
Getting interstellar vibes
Crazy man grew up watching you from mw3 till now it's been a pleasure
Ahhh that’s actually crazy we’re growing up but totally forgot you were as well GG king

It’s a goodbye but never a farewell 😢😢
GOAT NO QUESTIONS ASKED
Long live the King!
That editing though holy moly

Mannnn i still can’t believe it!! I don’t think i want to believe it…. You will be missed king 👑 Scump!! Competitive COD won’t be the same without you! Let’s end this thing on a Bang!! #lastdance
We will all miss you Scumpi :(
Got so much nostalgia watching this. Literally been watching since I was 11 or 10 and I remember watching growing up dreaming and watching you everyday now I'm 20 with a kid and your on your final year . Time flys
WHY AM I CRYING
This is like Nick Saban retiring to me.... smh. All hail the king. #GoatScump
You are the ( BEST IN THE GAME ) never for get that moment
the legend
end it with a bang scumper jumper
I am not missing a single match this new season, A legend I will ALWAYS carry in my heart
Dude. This video was excecuted perfectly. Literally symbolizing walking down memory lane. As you walked, so did I, so did us all, watching since I was in a freshman in high school and I’m 25 now … crazy how much a video game can encapsulate time
Woah.
Scump has always been call of duty to me🙌 Thank you for the memories👑
Honest to God, almost made me start balling lmfao   I love you man, I've been watching you since as far back as I can remember, you're the reason I'm grinding now that I'm getting close to challengers age. GGs my man, this is our year ❤️💯😈
Goat together with nade
Thank you for what you did for cod and professional video games
Scump from each and every one of us, thank you🙏, been a helluva ride brodie🤙
The memories will forever live on been a fan since mw3
Legend.
I feel like the last piece of my childhood is being ripped from me.  When I first got into gaming it was split screening in my friends sleepout playing mw2 while watching optic videos.   One last ride king👑.
😢 This was an unexpected surprise. I'm sad that this legendary era is coming to an end, but I'm so happy to see that King Scumpy is going to retire on his own terms. Long live the King! 💚
the goat
Let's go scump thanks for keeping me up to my grind I've been watching for as long as I can remember and if it weren't for you I don't think I would still be grinding as hard as I do so thank you for being the og scump welldone you are one of the cod legends SethySeth
are you aiming to make us cry? cause this is how you do it. gonna miss you seth
The greatest of all time
😢
We will miss you but great memories are left for the history of cod
Scump has nothing more to prove as he's, "the best in the game!!". He's made a very, very good living and absolutely deserves to go and enjoy life outside of the gaming world. Live your best life, Scumper and thank you for all the great memories!! "He's getting cross map kills with the scorpion!!!"
He made history
Why tho 😢
scump, you’re a legend and have been my favorite cod player for years! thank you for everything youve done as a pro and the amazing skills you’ve shown! its truly the end of an era, but you’ll always be the king😢
This was so well made holy fuck
What a legend. You will be missed.
Don’t blame him. Zoomers ruined CoD. Nothing but rats holding hands, walking around adsing…it’s just not good anymore. The era of beta males is among us.
Did he just say SIKE at the end?
brooooooo i grew up watching you dominate bo2, enjoy your retirement, comp will never be the same
The man who made competitive cod so great. Amazing video
I remember watching in middle school bro. Love you big homie. A lot has changed over years don’t even play anymore but I had great memories watching you play throughout the years. Thank you scump.
Scump truly gonna miss you! The only reason I still watch Competitive Cod anymore! The only plus side to your retiring is I finally get to watch you become the #1 content creator!! Go from #1 in Cod history to #1 in YT and Streaming, hopefully maybe on YT over Twitch
Quite literally the only goodbye on yt i've ever cried to. You're a living legend brudda.
Love when one of his old commentaries pop up on my home page still sometimes
I have goose bumps going through my arms watching this , Scump thanks for all the memories watching you grow up almost felt as if we grew up together 😢
Legend I’m not crying ❤️💯
Matter of time but I hope you stream loads!
Thanks for everything Scump! I enjoyed watching you over the years!
The BEST COD PLAYER EVER
❤️
Those Scumpii Black Ops 2 videos brought me so much entertainment and joy, I would watch one after the other staying up all night😭 Long Live the Ginger Ninja💪🏼
I got chills watching this
Whoever directed this did you justice man! Way to draw out every nostalgic feeling gamers had when we all started gaming. TEAR JERKER! End of an era for sure! You were the first competitive gamer to make an impression on many of us. We were teens then, i’m 28 now. Here’s your flowers Seth 💐 Single handily changed COD and competitive gaming forever! 🙏🏽
I’m actually crying 😥 end of an era
That broke my heart. This made me more said than when my grandfather shot himself 2 years ago and idk why.
This makes me cry
Seth you will be missed, great vid! End of an era for sure
LEGEND! 🐐
😓
F* finally!
GOAT sethy loved your vids for about a decade
I love you scumpi 😢❤
💔
All right who cut the onions in here
Good they the one that made call of duty not fun but the new one is far better then vanguard
Wow man
Hope you get the ending you deserve King! 👑
Seyuh
Omg no way bro I know it ain’t much coming from me cause there’s are literally 2 mill more but I have truly been w/ you since the jump as a fan since MW3 in the Black pool days all the way until now to me you are truly the GOAT in many ways more then just in game! I appreciate all the effort you have put in as a competitor/creator I know this isn’t the end of you in gaming but hopefully it still has something to do with OpTic cause I couldn’t see you anywhere else…. GOODLUCK in whatever turns you take now I’ll be here still watching 😂😭
I am now in fact old
A truly remarkable person and career. The impact you've had on me as an individual, from when I first started watching you back in 2012, until now, is something I'll never take lightly. Thank you for everything KING 👑
Greatest pro player to ever compete in cod
Fuck man. Time flies, greatest champion of cod all time. Fuckin legend. I still have a poster and jersey on my wall! Since I first played as a kid to now, never have I put the controller down. I followed your style, tips, and watched every match you've played. You're the man Scump. Enjoy life bro
Damn the last cod player I cared about is hanging up the sticks
Competitive COD won't feel the same. Thank you King for everything ❤🙏🏽
I’m afraid this just broke me as a man. A world without Scump is a world I don’t want to live in!!!
Pure respect for you, there will never be another one of you. The King forever 🙏
I love you bro fr
MMA is next
The GOAT 💚
can comp cod even be called comp without scump?
THE CHAMP❤
Dude I speak for us all here….. Just go out with a bang. That’s it
Thanks for all the memories scump. You’re solidified forsure man 😢
I love you, thank you for being one of the best players to ever exist
I have literally watched you play since I got into call of duty all the way on bo1 to know this is your final year is heartbreaking thank you for the amazing cod moments that you have given us over the years to the KING I hope this last ride this one last battle you finish on top
The real ones remember the face cam beside the mouse on Seth's desk♡
Can always pull a Tom Brady or Brett Favre
What a COD to end such a legend on.
We love you scumpy
Started watching you when I was just a kid, 11 years old! Now im 20 years old and a grown ass man. Wow you made me wanna be a pro cod player but time got in the way. But you didn't get in the way, you were always there. Thx for the memories! <3
I teard up during crims retirment now this....bruh I knew it was going to come at some point. been watching since since you where on Quantam leverage.
The man the myth the legend I’m so glad I got to grow up w you 🤙🏼
Scump will always remember the epic days of my childhood watching u compete thank u for the amazing memorys been watching since bo2 days
Why are you done ?
Scumpii the GOAT
Emotional
Damn man. Went through BO2 and on watching you, youve come a long way man, congrats on your success and good luck with your future.
Scump has been a beast but there is a time to hang up your cowl.  The hay days are gone.  Scumper will always be the beast to me…
GG
😭😭
Why was I crying 😭
Jesus Christ. Here I am almost 24 and I shed a tear to this. Maaan you and optic were my childhood. I’m so glad I got to witness all of it.
This like Kobe’s last season 😭 SCUMPII REALLY THE COD GOAT, NO QUESTION !
snip3down!?
With how empty this game is no combat record no leader boards you can't even change your emblem and nothing but some camos to grind for. Unless treyarchs "league play" frankly even if it is fucking perfect this might be the last cod I watch and play. I hope all the people who been playing since watching you scream whos the best in the game stop paying for these shells of games with me and others. Especially if the goat isnt even playing. Sorry for whining but damn this sucks
This man should have retired after Modern Warfare 2019 😂😂😂 he's been cheeks and cost optic too many wins. They would have been better off keeping envoy instead last year.
Love you scump❤
Man people said gaming was a waste of time and it would never amount to anything… look at what’s it’s done for me and countless others.. lifelong memories and countless laughs… you will be missed scumpy but never forgotten
Legend !!
Probably because he's lost all credibility now that Zlefter is optic. The brand is full of cheaters.. Optic hacking
Nooooooooooooo 😥😔
the GOAT of CoD 😢
The real OG GOAT!!! 🐐
Chills…. All throughout by body man.
The consistency is unmatched, we gone miss you gang enjoy retirement! Much peace, love!💚
Goat💪🏻
This man is about to dominate the streaming world and be the king in warzone 2. Cant wait to see it.
Production on this video was nothing short of amazing. Best of luck on your future endeavors.
congratulations on the many years of success, loyalty, and most importantly honor to the OG Nation. many blessings still to come and many blessings for your new life your going to begin with your bride to be. God bless you Seth Abner you will be missed but never forgotten. LEGEND to what we once called COD.
That’s crazy. Been the cornerstone of an entire community for YEARS. I hope this year is your best yet. Strictly good vibes 🤙
been watching since i was 10 now im 20
the best ever i love u sethy u made us who we r today
I pray u end your journey like Peyton
You are the goat Seth! I watched you since I was 16, I'm 26 now and still watching! You got this for your final year
Man oh man, what a journey you brought all of us along with. You have paved so much for the COD community and inspired so many content creators TO THIS DAY that are now big time streamers. We will miss you but enjoy this last year while we have it and you will always hold a spot in our hearts💚
Man oh man I can’t even begin to explain how hard I was crying and realizing that we aren’t kids anymore. We are all moving along with time slowly but surely. I used to watch Scump for days and hours at a time trying to mimic his movement and thought process through out each match I played in Cod. You were the reason I became a sweat and the biggest inspiration I’ve ever had to allow me to follow my dreams. You are the greatest FPS shooter player in the world man. No one can do the numbers up that you did. To this day Sweat Bannin is my all time favorite video of yours man. I love you Scump. Thank you for all the great years 💯💯✅💚. One more time for The Green Wall boys!!
I thought was already done competing when he left optic.
Dam... is it really that time?? i dont watch you much scump but ive witnessed your skill at many of the COD tourney's..... its sad to see an icon in this community leave but time has passed by and your grown up now, GGs King and thanks for all the good shows
😪
Goat
Love you scump. Put competitive gaming on the map for the masses. Forever grateful ❤
Noooo the end of an era is coming soon. So sad. Going to miss watching the Scumper jumper compete but can't wait to see what's next for the king! 👑
ITS MY TIME TO SHINE
Let's make it a good one to remember GOAT!!
Hey Scump. Love you man. I just want to say thank you, high school was amazing. I was happy when you won, I was sad when you lost.
Hands down my favorite player/team in all of esports, those bo2 days and every cod released before or around that time, mw2 etc, were some of the best times of my life. We were all just kids having fun playing a bit of call of duty, call of duty 4 was my first cod and it gave me such a unexplainably great experience, and then it turned into something even more amazing, gamestop tournaments, gamebattles, MLG! It took over the world eventually, but when scump first started competing those were the golden years of cod for me personally, and many others.    The teams, nv, complexity, faze, optic, and the personalities were second to none, its something that just happened organically and worked out perfectly, kind of like ogre 1 and ogre 2 in the halo days, it just had this feeling. Nameless, aches, tee pee, scump, nadeshot, clayster, crimsix and countless others, and even teams like fear with guys like fear moho who were mainly gamebattles focused though if I remember correctly. Those times were truly just amazing. I'm not 100% sure on this but I remember those optic matchups pulling insane viewership for those days, and to me it seemed like it was the true beginning of the gigantic growth in esports. They had the biggest tournament pools at the time , this was when league of legends was just beginning to grow into the behemeth its become, but cod was like top tier in terms of viewership and the sheer amount of money being tossed around for that franchise was crazy. It was just the pinnacle of gaming at that time and all my friends wanted to be mlg pros. I say all that, to say thank you scump, for making my childhood amazing, and for putting gaming on the map. You were/are one of the best to grace the sticks and I absolutely love you to pieces even though I've never met you. NOTHING will beat those mlg, scuff controller, kontrol freek, mlg xbox live profile picture days. Nothing.
Honestly my heart hurts much love brother thank you for everything together we rise together we fall together are the green wall one last ride let's take it all thank you scumpy green wall for life 😎
Ah man this actually made me sad! A strong reminder that we are all growing up and life goes on. Scump will always be the king!
Bo2 remastered is coming out eventually. I look forward to seeing you back for that, I’m sure. As alot of us will be!😈😁
Damn bro this just damn
Goodby king Scump. U Will always have a place in my heart. Without you things will be different not gonna lie, but the gaming community goes on. Thanks a whole bunch for the fantastic gameplays you’ve shown us and also for the content u provide for your fans. One last hoorah, so let’s go out with a bang ❗️
Don't do it Scump, I will have no one to watch oh learn from
To the best to ever do it. Cheers to an amazing ride
Childhood has been over but now it’s truly over

Win one more for the Scumpi!!!
The king 🤴 will be missed
Love you seth
ifu seth. It sucks to realize that the dream once had is not for u to do anymore. Games dying. New ones not as good. Atleast u can retire your professional career knowing u played in the best era’s ever man. The Golden Age. Made a name for yourself. A living. Became one of the best, a KING. Left a Legacy. As the greeks would have said, the name “Scump” will echo through the centuries man. Ty for the inspiration through the years and the work ethic i learned from u guys. The laughs, crazy matches…As a 13 years old kid who loved sports and gaming. Your energy and the energy if the old comp cod scene was definitely one of the reasons i fell in love  w/ Esports.😂I was sad for Mathias’s retirement too, but for u guys…its much deserved. #OG #King #28TournamentWs
Dude telling us he's retiring NEXT year and I'm tearing up now smh
i’m crying
I’d retire too if I had to play these sh*t CODs 🥴 See You On Your Next Journey 🫡
This is honestly going to bring a tear to my eye. The dynasty team is gone 😢 scump you have been my idle for years and years since the beginning. You are the king of cod in my eyes❤.
That see ya hit hard this time no 🧢
Long live the king. 😢😢😢  LETS GO OPTIC!!!
CDL roster is changing so much so fast
Best slayer of all time. No one compares. Thank you, Scump !
I love your bro 💚
champion
First time seeing this guy, and it's his goodbye video wth...
One word. Respect. ❤
Have been watching you for 10+ years King, you gave me such fond memories and got me hooked on CoD. Thanks for everything, congrats on your retirement and I hope you have one amazing final stint. Until the next one ScumperJumper :)
I just got the goosebumps and I’m crying cause you and optic were really the best moments in my life growing up when I had no one to turn to or no friends video games were everything to me watching all your videos while eating watching all your videos before playing a game you and optic seriously played a major role in my life I thank you and optic for everything I know I’m not the only who feels like this…
Fuck , I’m watching competitive cod because of you , I guess this is my last year watching it . Thank you king for all the memories , since BO2 and until now you are  the GOAT🐐 .
💐 🥀  💐 🥀  💐 🥀  💐 🥀  💐 🥀  💐 🥀  💐 🥀  💐 🥀  💐 🥀  💐 🥀  💐 🥀  Thank you Scump it would have always been to soon!
First Formal, now Scump. Emotional seeing an era come to an end like this, one last ride GOAT !

Someone needs to make a long montage with all your best moments
So many tears will fall when the last event comes.🥲🥲
Damn ❤
I grew up watching your BO2 gameplays; what a ride has it been Scumpy! Much love from Kurdistan! ❤️
ONE. MORE. DANCE. 👑👑👑
best outro vid everrrrrrrr
It was you and your very play style that made me into the competitive COD gamer I am today. I watched all your GB matches and just studied how you played, and that helped me conquer games. I will miss you. The legend but, you just enjoy your retirement!
king of cod forever
I’m dead inside
I'm so happy for you but yet so sad as many can agree... you will be missed OG, thank you. ill make sure this season will not be missed from this viewer...shea-ya
Damn. I honestly have been falling away from cod as I’ve grown older. I started when I was 13 playing WAW zombies with my friends after school. Eventually moving to multiplayer once COD4 MW came out. I didn’t discover Scump until black ops 1 but from that moment I was hooked on the content. I remember him always shredding but by far the most memorable content he had for me was his 70 kill challenge in BO3. I would watch the videos the instant the dropped hoping he finally beat the challenge, invested in every second of the video. I haven’t been keeping up with Scump over the past few years, only seeing a few videos or news articles with him involved here and there. But man am I glad this video was recommended to me. The amount of memories that flashed through my head while watching this made me feel…sad. Sad because Scump brings me back to my childhood. A time I will never get to experience again. But scump, if you do read this, you’ve engraved yourself into the childhoods of so many grown adults today. When we hear you name it puts a sad smile on our faces, as the King reminds us of the best times of our lives.
Been watching since I was 11, I've never been to an event, but after getting out of the military recently I decided I would fly to Texas from Detroit to watch major 3. This makes it all the more special. Thanks for an amazing childhood goat
this has gotta be the saddest video ive ever watched i shed a tear and im not scared to say it
I remember watching you during the bo2 days. It inspired me to pursue competitive gaming. I suck….but I made some great friends bc of it! Thank you scump!
Two words… Absolute Legend! 🥹
The Last Dance. King of Kings in COD. Thanks Scump. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍.
It’s been a hell of a ride, we’re losing the goat and god father of competitive call of duty
You’ll be back! Your the truth! If you quit playing cod will be dead
Bruh this is crazy. Grew up watching optic, since we're all damn near the same age. Gona miss ya man
The greatest ever
I haven’t watched optic/scump in forever. Used to watch him and optic all the time when I played cod. Lots of good memories in the past! I’m surprised you made it this far considering how much things changed tbh. Hope the best for your future!
Tom Brady of pro cod imo
Man that gave me chills to know this is it for the goat.
Thank you for all of the great memories in Comp CoD and just here on YouTube in general. One last ride!
Chills
The King❤
Thanks for everything Scump. Always enjoyed watching you. Good luck in your next chapter!
Who else teared up when Scump sat back while watching himself get hyped throwing his headset.. bro. Scump you and Nadeshot were my idols growing up in the Call of Duty scene. TYSM for the amazing entertainment I have had all these years. I am almost 28 years old and have been watching you since MLG and Gamebattles days. I even now have my wife enjoying watching you and she has never touched a video game in her life. <3 Your legacy will live on forever! Congrats on an amazing career and lets give it one more ride baby!!!
All love and respect for the 🐐.  Can't believe this ride is over... wishing you all the success in whatever you do next
What’s that match when he throws his headset? I’ve seen it but can’t remember exactly which game and which team he played against?
Love ya bro
I wanted to think this day would never come but it was one hell of a ride huh?
Been there since day one this is hella sad😭
Video 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goosebumps all over!
Hello, excuse me sir Abner, thank you for everything 🙏 so much love for you. Wishing you nothing but success and happiness moving forward
Just when I thought my day couldn’t get any worse 😢
Well that was dramatic
Gonna miss u goat 🥹
I’ve been watchin you since the beginning I appreciate all the laughs an memories you gave me friend
Scared me. I thought he was done...NOW!!! At least we get one more year. Hes given so much. I highly respect that. But please Scump.....don't quit making videos. Sincerely,  everyone.
Crying
The greatest to ever do it. Gave me chills, been watching you since I was 12 scump would be so happy to see you go out on top. Your legacy is set in stone either way. 💚
Thankyou .🖤
Crazy been watching since I was a freshman in high school(14) in 2009. ❤ I’m 28 now and remember the whole ride ❤
Remember first watching you in the bo2 days and watch the older days soon after... defo a legend I will miss 💙
U was a really big part of my childhood wish u the best 🖤🟢
I’m 24 and got mw2 when it came out and then found scump… the journeys it’s been with cod is crazy and to see him retiring makes me feel old 😂 best of luck to you.. you changed a lot of peoples childhoods on gaming!❤
I know this was your video, but my whole childhood flashed before my eyes. I still think of you as a 16 year old kid, just like I forget my own age. I grew up watching you everyday and playing COD every spare second of everyday, trying to be a fraction of as good as you. It's crazy how life just passes you by while you're not paying attention. I just turned 30 and now I suppose I can truly say my childhood is over. It was an amazing ride Scump, good luck this season and happy retirement!
Very good Video!!!!
watched him and optic all through my childhood.congrats man you the goat
undisputed GOAT
Epitome of green wall
I mean yea cod is dead
I'm in tears.
Sweatbandin
The last surviving member of the Dynasty, one of the greatest to ever done do it, Scump
G.G.O.A.T
The “see ya” at the end hit hard 😢
One more ride! 💚
Dude.. 😔 I wish you nothing but blessings in the future my man! I remember watching you as a kid in my room that I shared with both of my brothers. You’re what started my journey into competitive cod. I love ya Scumpii, it was a good ride!
You were apart of my childhood! I remember being 15 coming home and watching everyone at the team house. I just can’t believe it. Happy for you, but cod will miss you Seth.
Dam 🥺
I cant believe it. You are the goat of cod with rifle and smg without a doubt. ❤
I say this with tons of love Scump, I feel like we grew up together. This is the end of an astonishing era, it will never be the same without you. I will always miss that feeling coming home and watching your videos then hopping on cod feeling hyped! May this year be on of your best, the one to end on!
Noooooooo 😢
Genuine made me tear up. I remember the late summer nights I spent back in middle school catching up on all the MLG events and what not. Crazy to see how far life has came since then.
Rip cod 😢
End of an era, you will always hold the throne Seth. Goat of call of duty
Damn, I remember back when I thought I was amazing at COD league play in BO2! Man I thought I was the best! With my M8A1 and my scorpion! In reality I was that 12 year old, bang average platinum player thinking I could make it to the top and get into Optic! Without a doubt I attribute my passion and drive to Scump during them few years. Now, even as a 22 year old man who hasn’t played COD since he was a kid, with a university degree and high hopes for the future, I can say with complete certainty that Scumpii was the guy who got me through them few years and to a certain degree made me the man I am today! Thank you Scump, the best to ever do it! and I wish you the best in the future! Thank you!
😢
Bro my dreams of playing even semi professionally died recently to some extent and with this video they die all the more, cod has bin on a downward spiral for some time now, with the release of the new game I basically just give up, it’s over, cods over, sadly..🥲
SCUMP brotha… been watching you since you were in high school. Loved watching you compete on the pro level. I know this is your last ride and I know you’ll make the most of it. Congrats to you and your beautiful wife to be! Love live the King of COD✊🏾
King of COD
I'll miss you Dawg. Been watching you since I was a teen. Now I'm 28, thanks for all the great cod memories. 😪
right in the feels <3
It had to come at some point, thanks for some amazing times.
Did I just hear optic is winning cod champs 2023?
No way scump SAY IT AINT SO🧎🏽‍♂️
Glad to be announcing this will be my last year watching Esports! Thank you scump it will never be the same, always sweatbannin on them
Since the age of 13 man I’ve been watching you. Hope life treats you so fantastic you deserve it king 💙
Im here heartbroken💔, but that video production was on point as a videographer nice f..... video🔥 we really are gonna miss u scump just as im gettin back into cod with mw2
This one sucks
This is actually sad af 😢
An absolute LEGEND! 😭
Who's the best in the Game?      King Scumpy  https://youtu.be/w3sDyGSTPt8  Please review this match before u leave homie 💚
Gonna be so weird not seeing Seth on main stage playing and seeing optic without Seth on the roster
Dope video bro.
King Scump 👑
This feels very Kobe-esque
I knew this day was coming, but just didn't want to believe it. I'll be supporting you!
🐐 forever
Aw man that’s what he was saying on the podcast so many times “I filmed something crazy that I’ve never done before”. Scump is a legend
my final year as a CDL fan
Im an old man. LoL.well, I’m older than most of this group. I just turned 43 and have played FPS games my whole life. Unreal tournament, 007, Timesplitters, halo, call of duty loved them all. Saw the inception of online multiplayer over dial up if you can believe that was ever a thing. FF a few years. Got into COD competitive scene but kind of out of my prime at that point. I remember watching Scumpy play in his infancy. You could just tell that he was going places. Kid  had such a great heart and energy about him. He doesn’t possess an unlikeable bone in his body. As he grew as a player I have always followed him as he never ceases to amaze me with his gameplay. I have been wondering lately just how much longer he would hold on to the scene as time always ticks away.  Im so happy for him and sad at the same time. It is truly the end of an era for the entire video gaming community as one of the greatest to touch the sticks will be walking out of the arena. I give Scumpy a standing ovation and a big thank you for all the clutches that gave me chills. Well played my friend and GG’s but never Game Over. Good luck this season !
Seems he was waiting to see how mw2 was before making it final 🤔
Show them who’s the best in the games my boy 🙏🏾
Yall Got This Man Get Another Ring Let's Fuckin Gooo Scump Is Tha King
The production on this video was a masterpiece
You know why Seth doesn’t wanna play comp MLG COD Cause deez cod games are dawg shi he just can’t say it to the public or hell lose his sponsors! Fuck Activision, treyarch, cant rlly say nun about sledgehammer games cause they only made 2 Cods about to make a 3rd one. But COD DEV DIRECTORS SO MONEY HUNGRY FOR COSMETICS JUST MAKE THE GAME FUN AND ADD ALL THE OTHER BULLSHIT LATER. Srry just me ranting on Cod devs thinking its the reason ur quiting comp MLG
Man instantly tears hit my eyes. Been watching you and optic since before I started trying to compete. You have been my inspiration as a sub/flex since I discovered my style. Thank you for all the years of laughter and passion.  I may catch some heat for this, but you are the Kobe Bryant of CoD. Here’s to the last dance Scumpii🥂🎉
No,  just no, obviously you deserve a life which I have no doubt is going to be long and much fulfilled, but the COD scene is going to take a loss that without a doubt it can't recover from. That being said, that's on them, you did your job scumpii, you gave us gameplay, you were willing to put yourself on camera and stream, you've literally carried an entire franchise on your back and no matter what you do you have the support of all the OPTIC family. #WEMAKETHEGREENWALL #SHOWSCUMPLOVE
Love you ! The greatest to ever do it
Professional Cod ain't gonna be the same without you seth hope you stick to the streaming off cod or go in to casting side of it man much love and go and grab your second ring been a massive fan ever since you arrived on the cod scene and watching you play cod I can say for all your subs and fans has been good to watch and for me been good to tune in to as its been a go to place to release stress and just chill #💚🧱forlife
Gonna miss ya scump! One of the goats!! Love watching you play; go get it done this last year and enjoy the ride
Man this is fkd, Scump has to be the goat call of duty player
All hail king scump best cod player in the world your truley a G.O.A.T
Damn 😢 Bro you’e one of the reasons i still play! Because people like you that are genuinely good at the game have talent and credibility. I’m not knocking you for leaving if it’s because you’re at a new chapter of your life I’m all for that but if it’s because how bad gaming has got with cheating steamers/ bogus tournaments and the basic watering down of what could’ve been a great sport then I salute you.   you helped create the wave 🌊 and I’m glad you’re jumping off before it crashes   Here’s to you Scump,  A true gamer.
Boi I GOT SCARED FOR A SECOND THOUGHT U WAS ENDING ALL SOCIAL MEDIA…
I'll be watching at Major V
BETTER GO OUT WITH A BANG SETHY WITH 300K.D!!!
💚
No wtf
Why is everyone retiring?😢
I started watching in middle school. I'm now out of college and married

The true GOAT
Wow man I can't believe how emotional this made me. Scump you are the man dude I've been watching you since I was like 15 (13 years ago) shit I feel old haha. But honestly dude you really are a role model to a lot of people including myself ot only cause you're the GOAT but also because you're just a really genuine and good person. You deserve nothing but the best and I'm curious to see what's next for you! You'll always have my support!
Literally got chills.
The reason I started watching competitive cod. Not sure I’ll be watching after the coming year.

I cried no cap 😢
This actually hits, growing up with video games and witnessing the goat throughout the years. Good luck this year, you’re the COD goat!
Wow, I watched Scump way back in like 2010 to like 2015. Haven't really seen much over the last few years as I've gotten older (26 now) but damn, this brings back all the memories. Best COD player ever. ❤️
If you haven’t invest scump invest make sure still making those mills
6050 forever
I hope he goes out on top
Sad times, the competitive scene won't be the same without you seth, I've been watching you, hecz and optic for over 10 years and it really won't be the same without you there competiting. You're a true legend who's place will never be filled. Thank you for the hours of entertainment, the king has put in the work and now he deserves a rest. Good luck with the next chapter
Shout to you scump, only played COD but you are much more important to sports than just cod, Def helped bring it to what the industry is today.  Big ups, you are a true professional athlete
One of the best to ever do it 😢
Much love scumpii it’s never gonna be the same without you there’s no other ginger assassins
Anyone else get teary watchin this ? Maaan what a ride, to all the other day 1's we gettin old folks
At 1:15 he kind of reminds me of a cross between Macaulay Culkin and Daniel Radcliffe.
I remember the first time we linked ina lobby back in the day, can’t even remember with whom at this exact moment too many pros/gaming legends like yourself come to mind. Flawless work pal, you’ve been in the franchise for a while. I begun in the WAW era, I believe the first time your name surfaced up through word of mouth was around MW3.. I say that to say this, I’m 24 years old now and still play off the radar for fun at times but I started gaming seriously/heavily around 11, joined my first “clan” at like 13 and just kept goin from there til I abruptly stopped; due to life changes and adapting to them and such… congrats on your retirement man you made a living off of gaming long as you made a living off of something you’re truly passionate about and love to do like I am with music then in the end you’ll feel it matters the most to yourself before anyone else. I’m sure we all can say.. we salutechu Seth 🫡 be well ole homie  -StolenVoices (for the gaming purposes lol)
This is the biggest “I’m not crying you’re crying” moment ever
Time sure flies man.. our little scumperjumper all grown up 😭 What a legacy you’ve created. The kid in me is tearing up rn 😭 The last OG Standing. Professional CoD will never be the same without you. Thanks for everything you’ve done. This next year is gonna be an emotional one for sure. The King and Absolute 🐐Sad but also excited to see what’s next 💪🏻👑
With that said. This year is the last year I watch pro cod.
Oh man 😭
I watched a solid 60 seconds and I’m already tearing up, this man single handedly carried my childhood, farewell Sethy❤️
The video is so deep. It speaks by itself. Such memories watching you as a teenager 13-14 years, just waiting for those MLG tourneys or simply just a new Black Ops I, II, III new video. You’re the best.
used to stay up late night back in the early 2010s watching your videos while playing cod. man time flies lol
Can somebody tell me why this is his last year?!
FeelsGoodMan
As far as I'm concerned, you ARE competitive call of duty!  Lets hope you get back into streaming like the Black Ops 2 days.
The goat signing off 😢
I will never forget the 100k warzone tournament, and clutching up against a cheater FOR THE DUB!
The God of Optic 🙌
Dude I can’t even remember how much crap you helped me get through with your contagiously funny personality and of course THE BEAMSSSS…can’t wait to see you making other content more often if that’s what you chose to do. It was truly a pleasure to witness you play, no doubt the most raw skilled player to grace the sticks it’s not even close.
ily man.  Started watching you since bo2 era
🐐
Idk whether to believe this is real or not but honestly appreciate you scumpii KNOW DAT n I hope to talk to you in person one day god bless amen <33
Damn can't believe he's gonna start to compete as a pro ow2 player
Scumpy has gotten Chunky
Long live the king 👑
The GOAT
the king
Legend
I don't know you but ok
Og goat
No way I never thought I’d see scumps retirement one of the og goats taking his last year hopefully the team can make it a big one you’ll be cdl won’t be the same
I haven’t played cod seriously since bo3. I really don’t even watch cod anymore really. The only reason why I watch it here and there is because of you bro. A lot of mixed emotions, I’ll def watch all your tourneys this year and I hope you will pull out one more ring. Good luck scump!
The best pro player there ever was.
I’m not crying you’re crying 😊
Ugh man.... not gonna lie this kills me..... been watching you since your bo1 days dude..... if this shit isn't hitting right please swap the roster. You deserve at least 1 more ring before you leave cod. It's a travesty you don't have 3 rings with some of the teams you've had to carry
I want to cry
Crazy absolute goat.
imma fuggin cry
Damn got me crying at school
damn watching compete in BO2 while living at your moms to now truly an amazing ride I'm glad i was able to with you grow on your journey to becoming the GOAT
they jus had to make advanced warfare 2 omfg
But why
💚
Was playing MW2 last night and just knew scump wouldn’t want to play this game for 2 years and he would call it quits….. it’s been a wild ride King thank you for all the crazy memories!
bro I hate aging !  Man I remember seeing this guys with aches and all man , I hate that we have to get old
Raised me to the sweaty loving hard ass gamer I am today. Much love scump
Ok
Thank you for making me love cod. One last ride for the KING🫡
crying so bad rn
What an amazing video guys
❤️
Love you scumper jumper! Thanks for the times. Always the goat in my mind. Big love.
Loved the ride brother, hope the rest of your life is as much fun as your cod career has been to watch, much love🙏🙏
I love you scump you changed my life for the better and gave me a role model can't wait to see you in Texas!
to get this straight, are you quiting call of duty / youtube? or are you only gonna quit playing competitive and only do pubs or something?
My favorite player.. Central PA represent thanks for the memories
You and Optic were the biggest reasons for me getting into COD. I'm forever thankful to the community you introduced me too. Good luck, one last ride.
damn
Been watching you since I was just a kid in a group home man, inspired me to be a content creator
I'll never forget .... Scump, Nade, JKap, and Big T. I don't remember which game, maybe MW3 or Ghosts. The Day in the Life videos were some of the best entertainment I've ever gotten. Then they brought in MBoze Flamesword and (redhead guy with short hair, super funny guy, name escapes me at the moment...) great times. Great career Seth. The great*est*, actually. Congratulations.
Bro I watched your videos seen how u maneuver I feel like I can compete against u still I’ll lose lol but u taught me so much
i grew up with you mane, hard to see you leave ;( you were my role model since i was a jit
I'm not crying your crying 😢
GREATEST PLAYER TO EVER TOUCH THE STICKs
The King of Kings Scump👑 stay blessed man
Game over 😢
Well in scumpii the last dance
like seeing my gaming, esport, childhood coming to an END. Enjoyed every minute of it man. You always the 🐐to me!
It’s been an absolute journey Seth. Congratulations on retirement dude. Best of luck in the future! Make us proud this year big guy. All love ❤
LETS GO OPTIC!
❤
its okay King You can rest now
This was the most elite story telling I’ve ever seen. Takes me through the memories I have of you start to finish.
could make a grown man cry man😢
It has been an honor from my high-school days and college 25 now Good luck on everything you got going forward
Fuuuuuuuuuuu bro thank you for all the years of being the best. Forever the GOAT
Won Cod Champs, beat a cheater in a massive Warzone tournament for BIG money, gave us all huge laughs back in the Optic houses with the vlogs, and NEVER ventured off as most comp players do with variety streaming etc. You were loyal to COD and all of the Green Wall. Listen man..as hard as it is to call it quits..you gave COD and all of us YEARS of your life. don’t feel guilty Scumperjumper..you deserve this brotha! 💚
you’ll forever be the king of cod
Good times
Im a grown ass man and teared up.. thank you for all the memories. I can't wait to see all of the last you'll make this year in the competitive scene 💚🖤🤍
Scump the absolute greatest professional COD player ever. The game will never be the same without you, even though I’m just some guy on the internet I wish you all the best thanks for everything. Now make sure you show why you are the king of the pros.
like everyone mentioned, it’s bittersweet seeing this video. Scump is a goat and he’s the reason why I started watching esports as a whole. Thank you for the countless memories sethy. I still go back once in a while and watch the dynamic duo pull off the impossible. Nade and scump are just legendary.
was fun while it lasted
very surprised you lasted this long. though comp and pubs are totally different realms, core issues with games still exist. but GG none the less.
😭I’m not crying you are😭
You’ll be back
I've been following you since the beginning you have turned out amazing and your legacy will live on forever
Crazy what a way too hang the controller up , last dynasty too leave the comp scene 🤞🏽 all the best scumpi 🫶🏼
Long live the king
It would be the same I watched when I was 14 now I’m 20 and still reaping optic scump
i've been following since you lived with your mom and watched your graduation stream from HS. What a journey you've taken us on. Thanks for all the kills , chills and laughs. You're irreplaceable. bang bang   King Scumpii 4eva
Sad
Watching the infinite warfare journey live was epic. Best cod team ever imo
Buddy acting Like he a nfl Nba athlete lmao he’s a fucking gamer
rip scumperjumper
sadge
Don't blame you.. the game is trash
why am I crying I'm almost 30 what is this weird feeling... ❤️
This is a bigger relationship that I’m an adult and getting older than my business I own and run I’ve been watching Scump since bo2 always optic Vs Col I can’t even imagine a pro league without Scump he’s the definition of competitive cod
Wtf this is sad!!😢😢
Thanks for everything king💪
king scumpii 🫡
Absolute legend. Literally end of an era legit reminds me of when goku left at the end of GT :(
Bro I fucking hope to god you go out with a championship, would be a fitting way to go out for you KING SCUMPY
right in the feeeeels man
Love
28 years old and the memories won't be forgotten, times at the optic house with you and flame sword was some of the most  fun videos ever. Hopefully isn't the end of your videos but only a new start :D
Damn, absolutely made me emotional watching this. I grew up watching you and formal and the rest of optic through these years. You will forever be a legend.
The mf 🐐
Damn man this video gave me chills. So much nostalgia based around watching you play video games. Thank you for helping me grow up scump<3
I’m somewhat speechless to see this I’m 21 years old turning 22. Pamaj Nade and you were my childhood seeing this makes me sad but a good sad where I’m happy. Happy that you made my childhood something I won’t forget. Pamaj sniping skills Nadeshot’s skills from competitive to owning a new brand to you being that nature that wants to be the best having fun and just follow your dream. Thank you and I hope we get to see what life gives you next
Scumpii I’m 22 and Not only have I been watching u ever since u feel in love with Competitive cod back in 2011-2012 not only that but u was always my favorite player and a Idol to me holding back the tears writing this but I love u man always will and to me u the goat hands down no one is or ever will be as big and Electrifying as scump shit u not that much older then me we basically grew up together I’m having a kid now off topic but anyway I love u man and ima miss every moment of not seeing u out there rippin through TEAMS💜💯
One last dance GOAT! 💚🐐😢
Now 27 years old and been GreenWall through and through, mainly because of this man! Not ashamed to admit I had tears balling up for a straight 2 minutes there. Thankyou for the memories Seth! 👑👑
wow my childhood slowly fades away day by day😭
Nnnnnoooooooooo!
“Who’s the BEST in the GAME!!!” Scumbag ScumperJumper the legend
💚
The one who dont cheat and is actually legit!! All these content created are just a bunch of cheaters behind screen!..
What an impact and a legacy this guy has left with cod comp wow
We regret to inform you that your childhood has expired. Thank you for the memories Scump.
We love you Scump!
The FUCKING GOAT! They need to have a camera crew following this team around so we can do a last dance type docuseries for Scump.
Scump it has been a wild 12 years of me watching you play call of duty at the highest level, since MW3 into BO2, it will not be the same once this year is done….comes back full circle, started competing in MW2 to retiring after the MW2 2022-23 season ends… Thank you for all the content you brought us, the ups and downs and having probably the greatest Call of Duty Career…   Again Thank you 🙏🏼
Thank you Scumpii. You're the reason why I fell in love with OpTic and comp cod.
My GOAT
Dude the goosebumps are real
this makes me emotional, why i dont know.. we all grew up playing this game, we have played so many hours put so much time into it. it's in our memories forever and so is scump. one of the all time greats at COD
Wow, I still remember watching you in your room after school. Camera looking up at you from the side, TV on top of the dresser. The comp, the pub stomps, the pure comedy. Thank you for all the memories. A true King/inspiration to us all. Congrats on a successful career and congrats on retirement! We wish you the best! ❤
this made thog sad
love u scump
Damn i felt that🥲
Its so wild, I’m the same age as Seth and i’ve almost felt like I’ve been through this journey with him since cod 4. You’ve had a hell of a career, and I hope you keep uploading awesome content. Go out with a bang brother 🙌
SCUMPY 😩😩😩
I love you scunp
Scumperjumper the sweatbannin king for life!!! One last ride!!! #greenwall
Best Cod Player of all time. Rooting for you this last year scump 💪
My all time favorite COD pro, thanks for all the great memories
Been watching COD since the end of bo2 <3 From the OpTic van and getting full sailed through every victory and heartbreaker since. Good luck this year, brother
i never thought my childhood would hit this hard scumpy. love you like an older brother i never got to have. been one hell of a ride mr.OG 🫡
ahh see ya..
greatest of all time
One door closes and another 1 opens
Thankyou Scumpy bruz! Thankyou 🙏 All the very best..
I don't comment, but Scump was the pro alongside Made who brought me into competitive Call of Duty and I am forever grateful
Damn, this is so emotional. Been watching you since the BO2 days. Will forever be a legend, show us why you're the best one more time. Love ya scump.
this hurts
scump save ur yourself the time, this cod is ASS
You did that Seth, chills the entire video. Everything comes to end so put your all into everything you do guys.
At a loss of words man, after all the years I’ve watched scump play I would’ve never thought I’d see the day he retired. Of course it was bound to happen but it actually becoming a reality just hit me like a book. Always amazed and admire the way this dude would just control maps and games was something special, and I’m gonna miss seeing that. Truly an end of an era.
U R epic. Ive seen u play CoD. Still didn't have an fmj extendo/quickie heavymachinegun warlord loadout for defensive nor offensive bombing of the plane in the garage... But epic.
I'm 26 and was here for the entire ride. Thanks for all the memories
Never thought id get emotional over you retiring homie, your legacy will live on forever through me, and throughout my life. It has been absolutely amazing being a part of this amazing journey with you and i cannot wait to see whats next. The REAL Goat🐐Miss you already scumpy😭💪🧡
Bro I got clickbaited I thought he was saying he wasn't competing this year😅😅
LONG LIVE THE KING 👑
Impacted my life a lot. Thank you for everything. Emotional video
Bro I just teared up watching this
Didn't have to make me tear up man. Gonna really miss you Scump, you were one of the first COD players the young me found at the age of 13 along with chris smoove, watching your runs and copying your builds but unable to copy the skill level. Really enjoyed your banter, trash talks, Pro tips, game knowledge guides, insane comebacks and clutches. My school nights majority of the time ended with watching your videos before bed, it's the end of an era but one that'll end with a big bang. Looking forward to your final and insane year. Didn't expect my night to end with me basically crying, but here we are. Appreciate ya man, and all the great entertainment you've brought me.
$14000 on a gamble isn't a living wage. Wouldn't be a living wage if it were guaranteed.
Been here since I was 12, truly the goat. Thank you for all the memories over the years. Keep on keeping on brudda.
Why bruh
This one definitely hit diff  💚
The greatest to ever play the game
Why did my desire to play any cod go away after watching this?
Greatest cod pro💯👍👍
Wow man, watching OpTic for like 10+ years as I and others grew up with you guys so that really hits. Thanks for taking us along for the ride, best to ever do it Scump 👑
take a week off.. then.. we wanna see A Day of Raid part 2 or something! lets go! :D
snipers going ham. i loved it when you and nadeshot did that series it really got me into call of duty on how to have map control ect.
Been watching you since I was just a little kid, thank you for making my childhood so fun with video games you’re truly an inspiration and a role model
This is crazy 😢 it feels like just yesterday I was watching those old optic tourney clips and montages. Insane accomplishments with insane people. You had a great run and Thankyou for everything you’ve done for your community. 10+ years of memories we will never forget
This made me Tear up watch all the memories are crazy
So sad loved watching you grow up with the rest of us! Cheers bro, you deserve it🎉
There will never be another quite like King👑Scump. The dedication, skill, and passion you brought to competitive COD day in and day out was unmatched. Players will forever look up to you and strive to resemble anything close to the legacy that was your competitive career. I wish you the best Scumpy, and no matter where you go or what you do I'll always be a fan and supporter. 💯
lets ride
Make it a good one. I love you
Damn. <3
The best to ever do it 💙
Was deadass about to cry 😭
Helleva ride king
On to bigger and better! 💯
I cried
Bro am i the only one that got stuck in my feels watching this.
FCKEN LOVE YOU BROOOOO
ONE HELL OF A CAREER 🤙🏽 ESports as a whole owes a lot to the work you, Nade, Big T, and Merk put in at the original OpTic house. So many people were introduced into the world of competitive gaming from stumbling on your videos on YouTube years ago. Much love in your next journey King Scumpii, one of the best to ever do it. GREENWALL
That video was amazing I was already emotional watching a damn shit the memories we had with you the heartbreaks the championships the wins that was emotional the most emotional YouTube video two minutes and nine seconds I’ve ever seen of one of the best cod players of all time the goat scamp The king of call of duty and we all the green wall are behind you for the last ride and we are not going out as losers we are going out as winners at champs one more time with you scamp. 10 fucking years of our time watching you is amazing when you leave it won’t be the same at all nobody have the drive The commitment and the passion like you do. I can’t wait for the first land match in 2023 and hopefully Goes undefeated and one more thing scamp bring out the old scampi bring out the one that just doesn’t give a fuck and just damn dominate and bring out that mamba mentality.
Thank you scump for the great memories back in the day watching you with the OGs from optic the original ones!
Goose bumps... Can relate to the Gen 1 Xbox of halo man on system link 16 friends come over 4 Xbox's and 4 TV's with 4 ethernet cables it was going down after school in 2002...
thank you
who's the best in the game?!
I'm glad I was apart of the greatest era in cod history. 20 years from now when my kids ask who the greatest cod player ever was, I'll be happy to look back on those memories and show them. Definitely won't be the same with our you..
Is it okay for 22year old me to cry ? After 10+ years watching and idolising scump rise to the top bringing optic with him now 23 year is optics year !!!
Eres una verga bro.. ❤ y’all deserve champs rooting for y’all 🔥💯
Bye
Boys. Don’t be sad it’s over. Be happy it happened. We got to experience the revolution of gaming and we witnessed some of the greatest talents to touch a video game. We truly got to experience a once in a lifetime journey. Glad I was able to be apart of it.
Bro wtf lol this is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen
the year cod ends has come 💔
good for you man. legend
Man this shït is deep, I’m going to miss the king and it will never be the same without you, you’re a fucking legend Scumpii💚but goddamn you’ve earned this, you’ve been grinding for years bro I hope you finally get to do all the shit you couldn’t brother. Into the next journey 🐐
I'm 30 only watching cod competitive because of optic SCUMPY! sad to say this will most likely be the last year I watch competitive cod!
Say it ain't so, we aren't ready for the King to go....win out, go out in style.  It's the only way to end the Kings play.
my goat #T2P
Legit got chills
Anyone else have a bad feeling about this season for optic?
Lol all these weirdos that take this time to say how long they been a fan like anybody cares that u were 12 when u heard of scump lol good for him. Time to go start a family
Scump... Man... I grew up at the same time you did, and been a fan since the beginning. Through all the highs and lows... Man I've been wanting to be able to do the things you've done for years... Let's end it with a spectacular finale
We love you💙
LEGEND. Simply thank you....
WHAT A GODDAMN FUCKIN DOG
Damn
Jesus Christ I thought Seth was dying or something at first...a legend gone, but never forgotten...<3
i've never got so emotionnal. im so proud of you and your evolution. you are an inspiration for a whole generation who honestly, most of us needed a guiding light. you are one of those light for me. and from the bottom of my heart. thank you. for beeing a friend, an entertainer, a shoulder to cry on and of course being THE one and only king
you will always be remembered and missed brother much love! and lets make this last year one to fucking remember!

A cinematic masterpiece. Very comparable to your 1million sub montage. Thank you for my childhood
The greatest there ever was. The end of an era.
end of an era
Goat… I remember watching Scumpii playing black ops 2. I was 8 years old and Scump was like 18. Now he’s 27, and I’m 18. Crazy. One of they guys that carried my childhood.
That boi Scumpii is cold with it 🥶
ONE LAST YEAR LFG
I think it's safe to say that E-sports would have never been the same without you, thank you Scumpii 🐐
Been following scumpi for sooooo long and always a great player. One last ride scummmpppiii!!!
Didn't think i'd be emotional, literally been watching since the MW3 Ronaldinho shoutout lmao, i grew up with you and learned from your videos, feels like i know you it's so weird. It's the end of an era, kick ass this year and i'm excited to see what you do next
we will miss you
I'm gonna miss you bro but hopefully you keep up with content will keep watching bro you are one of my fave YouTubers
that was koo
Get em brother!!
Seth you made me fall for this game with ur YouTube channel and ur streams ! When you won that first ring 💍 it meant so much to the green wall . It’s was a long 10+ long years and now one last dance ! I’m going to watch all every CDL this year one last shot at the big one to cement ur legacy forever ❤
Scumpii “the King” good luck on whatever’s next cod will never be the same.
The best to ever do it.
Started watching scump religiously in BO2. So sad. Unfortunately cod isn’t what it used to be anymore.
Still feels like yesterday when he was nuking kids on Hijacked with the KSG...Time flies way too fast man
First third and champs ride off into the sunset
This is gonna be a 🔥 year brotha!
The true end of an era, I didn’t realize how much you have helped me grow as a person. You and optic got me and many other people through some really tough times and I will forever be grateful that I got to watch the best player to ever play cod play through his prime. Thank you king Scump 💚
20 years old been watching since I was 10 man and this just gave me gut wrenching feeling
All hail the king
Loved watching you play Scump! I look forward to your future!!  #scumperjumperfan4life
IM NOT CRYING YOURE CRYING!! been a fan of you since i found out about pro cod back in bo2 and just hearing this is crazy man you have been a huge inspiration to many and i hope nothing but the best for you SCUMPII
the king, you probably will never see this but you helped me thru the most difficult times of my life. Thank you scump 👑
Thank you scump. You made my childhood. This hurts so much on a different level. Me and my friends watching all the events even at work. The game won’t ever be the same without you. Thank you for the laughs and memories you made for us. Best of luck.  #OneLastDance ❤🥹
bye😢😢😢😢😅
Bro don’t make me fucking cry
This makes me feel old 🙇‍♂️
Scump you’ve been my idol for years since bo2. You inspired me to take gaming serious. You are the best cod player ever. I’m gonna miss watching you.
Nice! Welcome to halo
Nooooo
King Of Cod 😢💚
Couldn’t stop crying while reading these comments. Idk why I can’t stop even while typing this. This is the most I’ve cried in months/years. Oddly dramatic 🥲idk wtf is happening.   Anyways loll.  One last ride, King. We’re rootin for you.. as always.
Snip3down, now Scump.  eSports just isn't going to be the same now.
I will miss you scump, Optic from the moment the fire began until the last spark... One last ride baby... Optic Nation "Lets Ride"!!!!
🐐🐐🐐
If the CDL or what ever there called these days, if they aren't scared, or praying.  They fucking should be. I know scump is just one person,  but just wait. The numbers will progressively get lower and lower every year without him. You'll  see.
Dang man, been watching since bo2 and you're a huge reason why I even started watching and playing comp cod,  congrats on the all the success and thank you for being such a great role model for kids out there, good luck this season and in the future. #Greenwall
You truly are the King, and I salute you
Ggs legend
Changed COD forever🐐 this mans impact will never be matched
You’re the MJ of competitive Cod in my book… end of an era sir.
Been watching you since you nadeshot days with the boys!!!!! I love you man. Your shits inspirational
This gave me goosebumps
I remember just chilling at school watching scump live. excited to go home and play BO2 not even with friends since I didn’t have a mic, just pub stomping learning off of his videos 😂
I remember watching you for the first time when I started playing BO2, wishing you nothing but the best
Goat video
Cod games are so bad now I completely understand why you’d wanna stop. Been the goat for a longggg time. All the best mate
I've been following Scump since I was 12 years old at AW. I'm now 19 years old, and it's been a crazy journey rising up and following OpTic for the past 7 years. Scump inspired me to compete in video games, and he were the reason I continued to play CoD. It makes me sad to see the announcement he has made, but know that this is just one last ride, despite the fact that I no longer play CoD, I will still be following OpTic. Thank you.
All the best, my guy. It’s been a pleasure watching you compete and grow.
Im fkn 28. lowkey brought a tear to my eye watching this. Been following/watching for so long ..OGs yall remember apeX days during mw3 haha. Stopped playing COD since bo4 and have still followed and watched events. Time flies. Hell of a journey man. Cheers to one last ride!
It's been fun, Champ 🥲
Seth, you really had us in the first half. I ain't even gonna lie. The ride has been nothing short of an absolute lifetime. The Green Wall owes much of its foundation to your hard work and dedication. The work you put in from here, whatever that looks like, will be nothing short of the best close to a series that the gaming world has ever seen. This can't be goodbye. We all look forward to what you bring in the next rotation. And, as always, you're still Optic Scumpii. Keep up the good work!
The King 🤴
one of the GOATs, thank you scumpy!
Go out with a bang baby 💯💯💯
This video just makes me realize, at some point all get onto a game with our buddies for the last time and don’t even realize it. Reminiscing about lobbies, friend groups, and fun times past while watching this is bringing tears to my eyes.  But…. At least you can say that no one in COD’s history, past or future, will ever be able to say they didn’t know the name Scump. GGs bro, good luck this season.
Ur eyes are fried out
lolololololollololololl
Best in the game for years bro
Is and will always be my favourite player... One last dance let's make it a banger 🔥🔥
Been following you since I was in middle school. I'm graduating college now. Thank you for all the memories. Good luck I'll be rooting for you!
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
What a wild ride, cant believe were not kids no more. End of an Era, Well done GOAT.
I have to ask: what will you be doing after this year’s over? What’s next?  I care about you and I hope your life only gets better. Am I right to be worried?
Scump the bottom line is ur our child hood and competitive cod won’t ever be the same with out u. Their will never be another scumpii. Kill it this season and enjoy the next chapter of ur life brotha.
I understand your position Seth and I respect it but.. man does it hurt. Much love man.
The goat’s last ride
Awesome video, there will only ever be one King Scump
What's next for you?
Seth is the reason for my competitive look on games. I won't be pro material like that. But I'm always the just rank a game can give me. This guy is the goat. So many memories. Won't be forgotten. Hopefully he continues to stream and make vids. Be a shame if he left all around
SSCCCUUMMPPP 😭😭😭 you proved yourself to be the GOAT over and over again. We all loved growing with you king!
I’ll never forget meeting you at MLG Raleigh back when hurricane Irene was hitting the venue. You were still with Quantic LvG. I knew you were going to do big things. I’ve followed your rise to the top ever since. Back when everybody was still in school, waking up extra early to get in those few games before school. Now most of my friends that I played COD with have families, graduated college, moved on. Myself included, I still play COD from time to time but nothing will ever come close to scratching those days.     I’m going to make an extra effort to follow your last season, your content kept me going as a kid. I owe it to ya. Hell of a career man, hats off.    #KingScumpii
I have no words bro, he deserves it all. Definitely shedding a tear with a smile rn.
he was really our childhood , used to always watch him for competitive
THE LAST DANCE🥺
Thankyou for the Best moments mr scumpi 🥹🫡
I hope scump and optic win another title this year
The end of comp
Scump nooo don’t do this. 😭😭
Damn... Black Ops 2 seems like yesterday. 10 years... Not to mention Warzone being released during Covid Lockdown, the check list challenge, ladies and gentlemen.
You are the best in this F!&*ing game.

Hey man. Grateful to have watched you. More important than anything is your relationship with the Lord Jesus though. This life is temporary and Satan tries to keep us distracted. Repent and believe in the Lord Jesus if u haven’t already. Praise God for the freedom to play video games!
It’s crazy man. watching him since I was a little kid watching him dominate the call of duty world in mw2, bo2, bo3, etc. I can put it into words.. He has always been my inspiration, someone who showed me who I wanted to be. I can’t believe it. One last ride with the green wall💚
Ahhhh Scumpi😭
Thank you for all the content been here since the beginning crazy to see it start to finish.
Love Scump best pro, but it's  a good thing scump retired cod is so going to die now dogshit cod better start making ur games great again lol 19 to now been dogshit before that after Bo3 every cod is mid tier Mw2 is dogshit. Still going to follow you Scump till he dies or I.

Goat ☝🏻👑
Why scump?
COD RETIRES THE SECOND SCUMP RETIRES. . .   THE ABSOLUTE GOAT OF THIS SHIT. . .   THE DEREK JETER OF CALL OF DUTY. . .   OPTIC SCUMPER JUMPER THE PENIS PUMPER. . .  I could go on for days, thank you for being YOU, and TRUST everyone will miss you. . .
Damn I remember being in HS, peak COD, MW3, when I first started playing COD. I first started watching competitive and liked watching you. After black ops 3 and ghost I stopped because COD started losing my attention. It just wasn’t fun no more. You didn’t upload as much. I came back after warzone but other than that pubs isn’t the same
Why
I’m not crying
Please make goodbye montage put this in ❤️
Truly end of an era , I’ve been watching u compete since 2012 . Cod competitive will lose the biggest legend sad for everyone and thanks for all the memories. ❤👑
I think we all expected this, just thought he would of waited till treyarchs next game.  Wonder what game he's moving to. he said he won't be playing professional call of duty. does that mean you're gonna be playing something else.
The goat in Cod 🫶🏼
Damn… Thank you for all the laughs and being there through hard times for all those you don’t even know. Cheers to one more… Get this bread!!
Proud of everything you did Scump. Thank you.

Scump it's been great watching you play. Gave it a hell of a run man.
I’ve been following you for years and I have never seen you live. Going to make it my New Years Resolution to see you at every event far and near. 💚💚
Thank you scump
Hope this year Optic can win Champs! To leave the scene and with a ring can't get better than that.
WOW Mr Scump if this message catches your eye my heart bleeds green ever since your first competitive map and your first kill I have followed from a distance watching you play like a machine when that screen turns on you turn on and you turn up I got to see you once and that was back in 2016 when you travelled to Australia thank you Scump for the laughs over the years and I hope your next chapter finds you and gives you the happiness that cod gave you
Goat🐐 good luck to whatever you do king
Yeah...CDL is guna lose a lot of us old heads that watch...these new kids don't know the OG cod, they jus hopped into it but didn't learn it as we did
You’re personality is literally the only thing that got me into competitive CoD and it’s the thing that will always make me watch any video that you make ❤️
Love Scump always❤️ hey people don’t be upset everyone has to do what they need to do in life, sometimes we forget that we are all human that’s what makes it so special when you are able to be the top player of something you love. Respect the mans stats some athletes don’t even go as long as competing with some of  the work done by the pro player Esports community scump is definitely one of them we all should be proud for him hope you gets to enjoy the finer things in life
One last ring
Don't know who you are, but good luck.
GOAT <3
I can’t believe it 😢
Crazy how time just flies, I’m happy to witness your progress Seth!!!
This hits you right in the feels, i know its stage, but I remember watching Seth on team Levereage in 2010/2011
Scump you’re the main reason why I became a fan of cod. Watching your YouTube videos every night. It’s been one hell of a ride and can’t wait to see what’s next.

Literally heartbreaking. There will never be a nothing Scump. I doubt you’ll ever see this Scumpy, but if you do, thank you for the memories, than you for the highs, thank you for all the moments you pulled off a ridiculous play and me and the boys went off in a group chat about it, thank you for it all. You’re the greatest. Maybe not to everyone, but you’re the GOAT to me. Enjoy this year, but even more so, enjoy retirement. 🤙🏽
No matter what happens this year you will never be forgotten in our minds and heart. #LongLiveTheKing

The last dance 🕺
Who am I gonna get my “best classes” and that “yo yo yo” ….
U know as kid growing up playing games. What id give to see my life like that play in my eyes relive the good times like that. But this aint about me is about our boy. I think it sucks that at some point the good things have to end. All these years watchin u win some lose some. Its been amazing man thank you for all that entertainment back in the day. Sucks to see the legends go😔
This is the first Scump video I've ever seen. I'm halfway through and I have goosebumps. its because we can all relate so well to that first gaming set up.
Man I have been watching you since age 12 I am now 24 almost 25 such a journey crazy to know you are retiring shows old I am 😂
The years I invested in this team, the years I invested in you, the happiness you brought to everyone who watched. You are an amazing human. I see alot of " when I was 12"  just know Seth, I'm 30 I was watching you when I was 18. My adult hood has been optic and scump. This is the moment for the office when they say "I wish you knew you were in the good old days before it became the good old days" everyone please take this year and know this is the last of "the good old days" love you sethy and optic
Can honestly say I’m heartbroken by this you’re the reason I got into competitive cod! The cdl will never be the same without you scumpii! Forever my goat!
No not scumperjumper08 😢💔
Fell off
Can’t wait for this last year! Gonna miss you in the CDL!
LET'S GOOOOO BIG THIS YEAR.
I’m not crying you are
Man from 9 now to 20 I can say the scump era will always be the best #Thankyouscumpii
A certified legend. Best of luck on the next chapter!
Props to all your success over the years, you’ll be missed ❤
Just cried over the retirement announcement for a COD player… childhood well spent 😊
Truly a legend grew up watching you every week bro
😢
Been a massive fan and I’ve been keeping up with you since MW3 GBs with maxes hot….This honestly the end to my childhood as I know it. Best of luck in your future endeavors, god knows you’ve earned it!!
Noooo we love you your the reason why I even try comp ever since cod world at war
Love you brother ❤️❤️❤️
Most of the people watching here are in their 20s now including me. I remember watching this guy dominate in BO2 and it's what got me into COD. This man single handedly pushed competitive call of duty into the limelight. I think I speak for everyone here when I say this but thank you seth for all the performances over the years. Your legacy will carry on through our memories.
Thanks for the memories Sethy, you’ve been a major source of inspiration and enjoyment for me over the years. I know you’ll be world class in all your future endeavors! One last ride, King! Enjoy it man, you’ve earned it!
Nah this is crazy
Bro cods dead. They need to throw 1 B at him to stay or the league done for
You’ll always be the best player on any game and the world knows this. Been here all along, enjoyed every minute of it.
Bro nooooooooo I knew the day would come but damn man competitive cod will never be the same without the king 😭😭
Thank you sooo much for this amazing ride let's make this last year an absolute banger. Much love scump the king 🤴 ❤
Thankyou for everything Scump!!
hit right in the feels... ONE MORE RUN LETS GOOOOO
I'm so fuckin heart broken but at the same time I knew this was coming. It's already that time? Seathy boy is going  to start his family with the amazing Iz and we get to see that side? This is crazy. I'd love to see you compete forever but I knew this was coming. You are the absolute true goat of cod. Noone is even close. Hold your head high and hit this year out of the park my guy! Can't wait to see the next chapter of your life!
Oh thank the Lord I thought he was quittijg this year
Ain’t no way 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🐐🐐🐐
CHICKEN SKIN!! 🥹
With his retirement.  CoD is officially dead.
THE GOAT 🐐
I’ve been waiting for nearly a decade for a BO2 reboot. Thank you for putting up with the games since that.
Noooooo 😢😢😢😢😢
wow
Holy shit, I honestly did not expect this take me back as much as it did. I've been following you since BO2 when you used to sit in lawn chairs with Nadeshot and its incredible to see how far you've gone. This year will be your victory lap and I cant wait to see it <3
It's crazy how time flys I'll miss you scump you'll always be the best cod player out there
That it the end of era for Cod, kinda sad but good luck to continue your journeys in Halo 👍

Bro  dammm we are going to miss you king there never going to be no one like you
While everyone watched FootBall I was watching scumpi compete man lost of ups and downs I really enjoyed the process of everything I seen optic do. And Seth my king we love you man everyone’s gameplay goal was to imitate you ever since BO2 I loved cheering for you so let’s go shit on the competition one last time like you’ve always done Thanks for everything Seth ❤
Man! I can't explain the amount of chills that I got from watching this. You are a legend!
Actual shivers
The best call of duty player ever known!!!
Does anyone know if he means the last 2 months of 2022 or last year in 2023? I hope at least mid 2023
I wish you the best Scump, you’re literally the person who inspired me to keep trying to get better and be a “competitive” tier player for my teams. I’ll never be close to your level but you let me feel like it’s ok to get hype for yourself and scream during matches!   Good luck Big Scump Let’s Go Baby!!!!! 💚💪🏾

Truly the GOAT of COD. Grew up with you and Nade tearing it up at the OG optic house. Thank you for all the great memories.
Crazy to say I've been cheering for you for over a decade... From watching you in Middle School when I was around 11 and now im 22 years old....
Thank you Scump!
Man who's cutting onions 😭😭😭
This hurts so much 😭
Damn now tonight I need to go back and watch old bo2 competitive that’s where I fell in love with cod and optic and you my favorite pro of all time. Thanks for all the entertainment Seth. A monstrous career you’ve had.

Make it a great year scump.
was 13 years old when i first started to watch you and competitive cod, which really got me into playing it myself for so many years, im 23 now and it makes me so sad to know that legends like you are retiring, its more than just a game, its a community and memories i will cherish for the rest of my life💔
One last ride scump
the goat
I've been a fan for a decade now!!! I will always remember your twitch streams <3
This is so beautiful scump, I wish you the best, thank you so much for the entertainment ❤️🥺🤙😭
one last ride, i’ll make sure to watch it, hope it’s a big one for you scump!
Make this one the best year yet ❤
Wtf man.
“Bro look at the fuckin scoreboard! Who’s the best in the game baby?! WHO’S THE BEST IN THE GAAAAAAAME!” 💚
There will always be more world champions, but there will never be another King of COD!!
Dude this feels like a part of me is being ripped out you’ll always be a legend to us scump ❤️
I've enjoyed watching you over the years (first started watching during Black Ops 2 glory days) You'll always be the King of Call of Duty to me. Good luck to you and your future endeavors in whatever you do.
Love u Scumper
There is zero debate that anyone can offer, to try and rate this anything but the absolute greatest retirement announcement to ever be released visually! As I'm sure there are so many people that wish this wasn't true, but still love and support you and your decision! The video speaks volumes about your passion and memories that you have and created! Seth you're a COD god and myself as well as the community thank you and wish you the best in your future, stay blessed and stay happy my man 🍻
Man… I just got home from work, and this just hurts. I know all of us Greenwall fam, love and appreciate all the hard work and everything you have done throughout all the years for the org and us fans. It’s gonna feel so weird watching the CDL without the King in it anymore, this is crazy to me. But I ain’t missing a single game this season, for any reason. Work, internet, friends, I don’t care, if this gonna be the last season that I get to see my GOAT play professionally, then I’m not gonna miss it. (Scump is my personal Goat, others are strong contenders but this man is who I grew up watching everyday, molding my game to be like his, that’s why he is my 🐐 of pros)
shed a tear, can't believe how time has flown by.
As a 32 year old this hurts, literally watched Scump dominant COD for over a decade. One last ride
All hail the King !!!
One of the last remaining competitive players I grew up watching, I’m saddened to see your era end but excited to what lays ahead.
Man this is heartbreaking
dude.... you're younger than me but I've always looked up to you when it comes to Call Of Duty. Congrats on the great career, you'll go down as one of the best to ever play. Good luck in whatever you're doing next but I can only hope it involves more entertainment for us, the viewers. Keep on keeping on.
dude i grew up watching you, we're almost the same age....havent kept up with cod in a while, but id be lying if i said i didnt feel this. beautifully made video, and good luck to whatever you do in the future man, you've helped me through so much in the last decade
I still go back Go watch the dynasty winning champs and not only because courage godly commentary
Who
Love you Scump. I have enjoyed watching you over the years.
Wow this is surreal
Not watching no more... Followed scump my whole life. He was who I looked forward to seeing play at majors and even online, the one true goat will be missed sm.
Thanks for the memories Seth, truly the end of an era
ya hate ta see it.
Never thought I'd get emotional about your retirement.  Knew it was coming sooner rather than later.  This sucks, go kick some ass this year.
You were the reason I played competitive cod. LONG LIVE THE KING 🥲🫡🫡🫡🥲🥲🥲🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡👑👑👑👑👑👑
Damn…
Damon after mw Matt after CW Crim after vg Seth after mw2. The curse is real.
Thank you scump u have been a role model for me in the call of duty community i try to base my game play and skills off of urs ik i will never be as good as you good luck this year and hopefully the door ur opening is a good door
Jesus. Surely not?
That’s crazy…love you man
Competitive call of duty loses a legend. Old men of optic gain the king.
GG OG
I watched ur first ever comp match, and now iv’e lived long enough to be here when you play ur last games as a competitive player. What a journey, thank you Seth.
Anybody else she’d a tear 😢😂 Excited to see what you can do for your last year king I know it will be amazing! You’ll always be the goat.
Wow. Honestly didn’t think this day would ever come. Great legacy and a great video too
ok cheater
You were and always will be my inspiration, you taught me so much I’m really going to miss all of your content and your drive. It’s been 10+ years watching you and the OGs of call of duty live your lives, it’s heartbreaking but also heartwarming knowing I will always cherish all of your hard work and dedication and COD sadly won’t ever be the same without you. I wish this was a lie but it’s not. 🎉❤Your the best, GOAT!!!!
thanks for everything scump, you'll always be the goat.
been watching you 15+ years bro this is emotional asf man love you scump your the greatest of all time.
Thank you Seth this is simultaneously the best and worst day, I’m glad you’re taking time for you and for your marriage but I’m sad because my childhood is over. I’ve been a fan of you since I was 7 years old and I will be turning 18 soon and seeing you walk away from this hurts. I love you, forever the king 👑
The 🐐
unless we win lol
Fuck bro.. been watching you since BO2. Not gonna be the same without you. 😭
You and Nate we're the best I loved watching you guys.

I grew up admiring you, to think 10 years has passed is insane. Only living a couple hours away in pa and being the same age you were such an inspiration and to see where you have got is incredible. Thank you for everything you have done for the gaming scene and for me personally with the countless hours watching all the streams and youtube videos. I can wait to see what you got instore for after!!!!
I’m happy that you get to focus on life now, live it how you want to, while being blessed with a beautiful wife. Sad to see you go though, CoD will never be the same. Thanks for being you, cause you’ll definitely be missed. T2P4L
Scump forever.
You made me fall in love with COD. Thank you man
Weird that something we saw as a teenager of WhT COD nadeshot and scump Faza seems to an end gg
Not okay showing your age but ours , following you for as long as I have I can officially be okay with retiring as a competitive watch sense I’m not a young boy anymore
Super proud of you man!
😭😭😭
Damn this really hits. It's awesome that HECZ and the org allowed him to announce his retirement on his own channel
This gives me goosebumps 😢
My man scump, is done DONE, 37 years old guy been watching you since BO2 my guy, I wish you the best and the future. Much love to you and fam bam
They say gingers have no soul, but no. Competitive CoD just lost it's soul.
So crazy how this just broke a chest bone been watching you since i was 10 Im almpst 22 now wow time is continuous
well done sir
The king now can rest.
if you don't cry you never felt it!
I think my soul just left
love you scump. cod idol 🥲🥹
Shit had me in tears bro gonna miss scump he's a legend
Michael Jordan the Last Dance Cod Edition
The goat of goat’s.  We need some merch man.
Was takin a shit and first time ever I teared up while takin a shit. I came to the US in 2011 and 2012 was BO2, SCUMP; You taught me ENGLISH!!
my heart dropped when i saw this title, scump you were and always will be a legend to this beautiful game we came across as children, thank you for all the memories and i wish you the best in your next chapter. The name will live forever. S. C. U. M. P. 💚🤍🖤
Seen this coming, but wished it didn't. You're the cousin I never actually met but watched all the time. 10+ years feels like I know you and I know I'll still stick with you where ever your next journey is. Because of you and the green wall I'll always feel like I have crowd in front of me chanting my name.  #ScumperJumper
Thank you for making gaming cool
One of the best made videos of retirement ever. End of an era. Loved every minute of your ride Seth, you are a household name and my kids even know the legend of you. You will be missed but it's your turn on the family life and watching the game!
It's been enjoyable watching your gameplays Scump. Enjoy your retirement from COD. I'm just wondering, you mentioned it was your last year with COD. With the Halo 2 image that appeared on the screen, could that be a sign you might switch to Halo and join Formal?  I enjoy playing COD myself. I'm not by any means great at the game, but it's fun. Soon to be 49 yrs old, I can't expect too much anyways as far as gaming. My eyesight and quickness aren't what they used to be.
GGs scumpy. 💚💚
Fucking legend
*Legend. 🟩*
The goat for sure
Why did i tear up sethy 🥲 pretty much grew up together. WILD
Congratulations on such a successful career boss.
I was gonna cry😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you for one more year of the goat the greatest player to ever touch the sticks optic scumper the penis pumper
Since Bo2 when i was 12 cant be real:<
Bro just why
Oh man, right in the feels.
Wow. Thank you for everything, Scump 🙌🏼
🐐
Yo King! A fan from the Philippines right here. Dont worry, I will still support CDL especially OpTic.
Gave me chills
I mean as long as ur still uploading videos we’re good 👍
I’m a long way from the days of my call of duty career. But even then I still kept track of the ones who mattered most growing up. I know you know you’re one of the best cod competitors of all time. But video games revolutionized a generation and you were at the peak of that from the beginning to what seems like they shift that’ll be happening soon. Inspired so many kids and changed lives, a pinnacle of a part of humanity.  Thank you bro and I can’t wait for this last year.
whyd u decide to do this around mw2 release? I'm just curious
Scump for president.
Damn hate to hear
Lol wtf , how am I almost crying and I'm a25 year old man. Gonna miss you Scump
💚💚💚 goodbye cdl viewership
Chillzzzzzz....that opening though 👌
One More Time - Daft Punk.   Let’s go Scumpi! Bring it home.   #GreenWall

The GOAT.
Thank you for the laughs during some of the hardest years of my life Seth
This is one of the final dominoes to fall from my childhood, CoD just won't be the same without you
nah bro its a 2 year cycle you aint getting out this easily my guy you got 2 left in ya king
childhood over
I was so excited to see you play and to get you to sign my wallet and a picture with you that was the best day ever let’s get this chip scump and end off with that dub baby let’s go
From a FaZe fan, you have my respect bro, cod wouldn’t be the same without you, thank you for the memories and I hope you guys win a major this season!
My heart…..😢
When the King puts down the sticks …so will I …I have played with and against him in Rank Play League Play and Arena…the best player I have ever seen…Cod will never be the same…Long Live the KING!!!
Let's go out with a bang💚
What an amazing career, thanks scump for all the good times and I hope you stick around.
Congrats on everything you’ve done.  You changed Call of Duty and pushed the comp way higher.  Cheers to the GOAT!
I genuinely can't get my head around this announcement! End of a big era not only for the game but for me personally! My only interest in cod still is because I know you're still around ripping it up in comp. It'll never be the same again! Scump, go out with a bang! Do yourself proud and show the entire world why you've been known as the king and the best of the best all these years! Good luck this year! I'll be sure to watch as much as I can 😁
The creative approach to this video, and seeing you reflecting on your old setups, clips, and memories was very well done. SCUMP, just like Griffey was my baseball icon - you have been my COD/gaming icon!!  I assume you'll move onto content after this next season, so I'll still get to enjoy your competitiveness and your top of the food chain gun skill and gameplay, but I will always cherish the memories you have given me and provided to this entire community. Thank you, and good luck! #GoOpTic #GreenWall #TheBestThereWasTheBestThereIsAndTheBestThereEverWillBe
Nah this shit gonna make me cry wtf
Speechless… thanks for the ride homie. You have inspired me in so many ways. Will always be a fan and continue to support you. Can’t wait to see what’s next for you.
Everyone loved you from the Call of Duty Trickshotting and Sniping scene, this really is the end of a era in competitive Call of Duty and we thank you dearly for all the great memories!
You’re literally my entire childhood. Thank you so much for all these years of dope COD content, and just carrying the comptetitive COD scene on your back. You are a LEGEND. GOAT. HALL OF FAMER. Thank you for everything, Seth. I will forever be grateful for what you did, and this made me sad. Can’t wait to see you kill it this year for the last time! LAST DANCE❤️
Living Legend salute 👏
Finally now we all get to watch the goat demolish everyone in warzone and other shooters now
Dan bout to make a grown man cry. Been watching since before you were sweat bannin lol always loved watching you. What an amazing career. And congrats on the engagement
I don't think I'll ever be able to watch comp cod without scump playing, I just don't have the same interest in the newer players the same way we all did with the og's of comp cod
The best competitive cod player of all time imho 👌 thanks for the memories big man 🙏 let's get one last dub before you leave man 🔥🔥
Damn straight chills with intro no lie 💯

eehhhhh cya 🥲
This announcement has got me very emotional, competitive cod will never be the same without you scumpy
Gonna be the most watched call of duty tournament events ever
Thank you Seth! For everything. You guided and motivated a generations of cod players. We thank you for everything within the cod scene.   It’s been a long road watching you as we all grow older together. But your passion and love for cod never changed.   Brought a tear to me and most likely a lot of others when we watched this. But again thank you and this hopefully is not the end
Cod dies with you brother
Forever the goat
One last ride 💚
One last ride 🤞🏽
Damn… this is really my childhood..
Crying real tears for ya scump. I think I finally realize what my parents feel seeing there favorite sports player retire. Many memories, many lives saved, many lives created, a BIG legacy & even BIGGER standard left behind. Thank you scumpy. You’re engraved in the game, LEAVE THIS MF WITH A BANG.
Literally have a lump in my throat, 💚GGs Scumpii GGs💚
So emotional, so many ups and downs as a fan. Truly honored to have been able to watch you compete. One last dance lets end this the right way brotha💍
Thank you for being one of my favorite esports pro and for introducing me to pro call of duty pro scene alongside nade ap and censor give ‘‘em hell this year
We fucking love you scump. Been watching you since Aw and B03. To this day i sometimes go back and watch 70.
Your the reason i love cod but I understand you gave us more then you know team scump for life...
Bro Instantly when I saw the title this shit lowkey hurt ngl bro started watching u in 2nd grade n to think I’m 20 now bro my life used to be so different no grief no hard struggles no responsibility it was just different gaming fr help wit my family struggles getting through certain things an just wanting to be just like him in the gaming aspect man was an literally is a call of duty god just watching bro helped a lot just really shows everything is not forever hope this last year is a great one bro shit is really wild man definitely know u changed a lot of ppl
my inspiration for cod since 2012..  love you scump❤️
I would quit too if I had to play games like infinite warfare, MW2019,Cold war and vanguard.
Noooo
The trophy must be defended, so winning champs this year will give you a reason to stay for one more year 💚💚
Damn. Love ya scump
Thanks for  greats moments SCUMP, OG!
After you leave it really will be the end of the ogs time In CoD.
The official end of call of duty. Will never recover from this

Damn been watching since mw3
Bro I’m soo fucking sad I’ve been watching scumpy dumpy since ghost time flies I still remember how crazy he was back then
Straight up LEGEND!!!!
You can’t do this to us Seth 😢
Gamers copying Lebron haha. Real talk, though, Scump is dope. Imagine what gaming is gonna be like 10, 20, 50 years from now. He’s gonna be the Babe Ruth of gaming. My little ginger human aimbot got me tearing up right now 🥲
if it werent for that OG scump/nade duo back from bo2 league i dont think i would have gotten to experience all those times as it gotten me into GB's and leagues, or have met all those people i know today. this is wild...
Thanks for all the great Moments KING
Started following you back in the black ops 1 LvG days, been a huge fan for many years. You’ve been a true inspiration to many of us through the years and produced timeless moments and memories! We all gotta stop some day, enjoy MW2! and ironically for you, almost where it all began!. Let’s see some more trophies for the retirement shelf ! Best of luck Seth
King Scumpii! You are a living Legend!
End of an era. Thank you King! 🥺
Cant believe I found out about u when I was 8 years old I’m 21 now time fucking flies
The 🐐
Damn 😪
What the fuck man you kidding?
JUST TAKE ME BACK TO bo2 😢
4th time I’ve watched this and scump retiring just doesn’t feel real feels like something is off but he’s had a hell of a career been watching optic for 10 years now crazy to think there actually won’t be anymore scump after this
The 🐐 hanging them up. Thanks for everything
Goat. Been there since the upstairs stream room at 6050. High school sophomore to 26 year old. Goat man. That’s all I gotta say.
i started cod with you i cried with you i thrived with you i found a mentor to follow and now i am up to take the route of the king scump, an end of a legacy the best in history. thankyou for being the best and for ur greatness we thankyou i thankyou scumpii, yo yo yo what is going on guys it’s yo boi optic scumpii signing out😢❤❤❤
Man, this is very emotional for me. Watching you for so many years. From leaving optic, to only come back less than 24 hours. With Nadeshot, Big T, Mboze, Merk. From "Clapping cheeks" "I'm the best" "Bow down" and so many cluthes. and winning Champs. Scumpi getting hyped is a different feeling. Best prayers and thoughts for a great new future and new beginning with your family. The G.O.A.T. KING
I’m proudly to say I teared..
This edit was sooooo cool but damn it made me sad. I hope you go out with a bang bro!
Nooooooo 😢 I’m a faze fan but you were my favourite ever pro player
I will go see you compete live , that’s the last thing I do
Outlast crimsix was he goal. He got it 🤣
Congrats on amazing career, Sethy
Whoa what a cool vid  Love you scumpii
you are a fucking legend Sethy. been watching you since Bobby took you in black ops1.  truly an emotional video
Man oh man. Remembering back to those days of watching you on BO2. Never appreciate what you have until it’s gone. WHO’S THE BEST IN THE GAME. Be good my friend, what a ride
I'm not crying you're crying 😥
why am I crying
And now my depression is back😢
At least I get one more year to watch.
The goat
If the CDL doesn’t hold the championship in Texas to give the deserved and correct goodbye to Scump, they clearly can’t read the room and doesn’t understand the impact he’s had on this sport!
love you scump thanks for all the memories
It’s okay we got nadia the man
When we didn't know we were experiencing the good the good old days before we knew they were the good old days. Much love Scumper Jumper.
You are the GOAT of competitive cod. You and Optic made my childhood. So much love and respect for you Seth. One last ride baby lets get it!!
Sad to see you go. The greatest of all time.
This man really played the new game for 1 day and then announced retirement
👑

Hopefully I get to see you in IRL but just like the old man cap said one last time. Thank you scump and you HAVE to win this year no excuses.
Great video but where is the dislike button because this is so sad 😢 The King is gonna be missed thank you for so many great years and memories

Why Scump why? I came back from the happiness of my best friends wedding to this.  Honestly though Scumpy, your ability and personality got me into COD.
crazy how we've watched this man grow up while we've also grown up and how he's made our childhood in a way. competitive cod will miss you surely and i only wish the best for you moving forward, this season and content wise. ill never stop watching ever since those bo2 pubstomping videos. the greatest of all time 🤍
NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOOO IM OLD IM SO OLD
what a video. made my cry
One of the greatest and last og comp player for my gen…. Fucking crazy how everyone I grew up with watching are no longer competing. What an era to be alive to witness it all. Atleast we have YouTube to relive those memories.
🫡
Tastefully done Sir. Wishing all the luck for this year and beyond.
Well looks like i gotta find something new to watch. I loved watching you play competitive cod. End of an era. Scump is by far the true G.O.A.T.
Thank you for all the memories you always will be the KING of CoD
Never thought the day would come dawg. Grew up watching since 6050 and seeing this got me feeling emotional. Defo seeing him play at the major this year one last time. What a career, KING
An absolute pioneer in the competitive world.
Will always live in my heart take it easy my brother 😭❤️
10 years of watching you compete. YouTube videos and Twitch streams. Last month I started re watching your bo2 videos. You’re one of the best Scump! Hope you have the best last year and retirement from the competitive scene. You earned it and we will stick beside you in whatever your future holds.
End of an era, time to get one more champ
Always gonna be the goat of cod in my eyes 💯🐐 unfortunately there’s always an end to everything 🥲 thank you for all you did to us fans/supporters 🙏🏻
Real tears coming out
Damm this sad lol

hoping this year you guys travel to different venues need to see scump play live
Your the reason I got into gaming .. thank you for many years of awesome content . Been a pleasure watching you and the green wall since like 2013.
I’m not ready to watch this… I need to prep for this
This was heavy man... hope you continue streaming/creating content. And I will always go back to your bo2 live coms periodically :)
the editing was...wow. amazing
From this day on  to the end of the Season , it’s gonna be a sad year know what’s gonna come . I’m sad but happy for him , mix emotions. I have watch scump play since bo2 all the way to now . Optic and scump made me the cod play I am today . So shout out to both of them . Gonna miss scump next year playing . But happy to see what scump future gonna be like . King scump the goat of call of duty #SCUMPIJUMPER
It truly is crazy to see this. Years later and two kids and to think I watched and played this fun game with my brother for hours on end. Long live king scump. True best player to ever pick up the sticks. The new generation will never know what it means to go off on kids with score streaks in the air just absolutely decimating and putting the hurt on Lobby’s and going off on the main stage
Has been a pleasure watching your journey. WillBe watching this year and wish you the best in the future!
I’ve been waiting for him to come on stream all day i knew something was off 😢😢😢😢😢
Legends never die
Duuuuuuude (Seth voice). Can’t believe it has arrived. We all hoped this day would never come, but knew it was inevitable. Beyond thankful for Seth Scumpii Abner and all he has done for not only the Call of Duty scene but for Esports in general. I feel bad for myself and all the other fans who have watched him over the years but i feel worse for future generations who will never be able to say they saw Seth play professionally. Scump, you are the goat, we are beyond thankful for everything you have done. We shall never see your like again. Cheers man - cannot wait to see what you have for us next! 🫡🫡
Ain’t no better way to end it with MW2! Thank you King!
You got me into cod comp, I appreciate you and will always follow you in whatever you do. Lets end this last season on a W !
I’m gonna miss watching u even though I’m a ATL fan. But competitive cod will never be the same without u
I love you man thank you for the years of great memories and pulling me out of some dark times the seen isn’t gonna be the same without you 🖤
Legends Never Die!!
It's never goodbye, only see you later. You the 🐐 and to this day the only reason I watch competitive COD, haven't even played the game in 5 years

So crazy how fast time has gone by, remember being a little kid watching him, nadeshot and the rest of optic back in the days like crazy.
😢😢😢😢
Scump is the best of all to ever do it
As someone who wanted to get into the competitive scene this year I’m sad hearing this :// so many years of memories. CDL wont be the same without you man.

Wow… all I can say I would love to go back in time to MW2 days and relive the good moments
Bro this is sad
i deadass teared up
I’m crying as I type this. I’m not ashamed to say this truly feels like the last chapter to my childhood is closing in front of my eyes. I was 12 when I began watching you in the black ops 2 days, and since then I’ve seen you go through so many ups and downs just as I have. It’s crazy to think this is it. Thank you Scump. This last ride is for us all. Make us proud
Scump lived every single gamer dream 🔥we will miss you scump
The GOAT
Then I think it is also my time to respectfully stop watching professional call of duty… one last time scumpy. It’s time to take the gloves off!
My man the fucking legend, the og. Im watching you since bo2 man, ill cry scump
I really wish we didn’t have to end it on this shitty ass game. I’m counting on the T2P comeback for the Treyarch game baby 😂  like most of the people in these comments you and Nade were my childhood I appreciate y’all for that
FaZe up
NEVER WATCHING COMPETITIVE COD AGAIN  CRIMSIX GONE  AND SCUMP im getting old and so are they.  Only person left is Clayster
I'm not crying, you are.
I grew up with this dude watching him back in MW3 through all the times with Nade, leaving to NV, BigT on stage to retiring, watched it all live man and I got emotional with how this video was made because every moment I was there watching and I feel apart of it even though I never competed and to see him leaving fuckin wrecks me man but whatever makes him happy Im down for and Congrats on the engagement Seth!
The Last Dance!!!! Thank you for inspiring young me Scump. Best of luck to you.
Thank You Man✍︎
I can’t believe it! I knew it had to come at some point but you and comp cod have been such a huge part of my life. So many hours spent watching videos and streams. So many years of entertainment and community. I’ll enjoy ever second of this last season but wow, how bittersweet. Best of luck, champ. Let’s go OpTic!
Damn bro the memories 😢
💚
I started playing BO2 and stumbled upon your gameplay of your near almost 300 kills and became a fan. Can’t wait to see what the future holds for you
Why the fuck am I crying bro
Damn bruh you literally got a nigga bouta shed tears😭😭😭. Legend!!!
I'm not crying. Your crying 😭
breaks my heart but i wish you the best thank you for all of these amazing years! watched every video you have ever posted
Your smart and knowing  what’s going on in the cod seen with all the corruption . Legend
Grew up watching Scump back in the BO2 days. From dropping nuclears, to league play with Nadeshot, to going 143-6 in pubs, this man did so much for call of duty competitive scene and from an entertainer's perspective at the same time. Absolute legend.
The greatest ever 👑👑👑👑🐐🐐🐐
Chills and green tears. We the green wall will miss you brother.
If it wasn’t for you COD wouldn’t be what it is today!! Thanks Scumpii!! There will never be another! Long live the King! 🦾👑💚
the goat
End of an era, gonna miss the 2010s, but we all have a whole century in front of us, time to see what comes next boys.
❤
The Last Dance
Been watching you since I was 13 years old haven’t been keeping up lately kinda out grew it but only came back to watch you n optic play very emotional I can say the least cuz feels like a chapter ended in my childhood as well as your congratz you will always be a legend 🙏
You have inspired thousands throughout the many years, including me. I’m only a very small channel, but I love making videos and would never have thought of even starting if I never stumbled across your pubstomping videos from way back when. A true King
Even he knows cod is horrible now.
Champ
One last dance king 👑🟩
The King, this is the end of a era for me him going he was the last of the ogs, what I’d give for him to get worlds this year
Damn brother, right in the feels. Def the end of an era coming. You're a legend man, the Tom Brady of the cod scene through the years. Good luck my friend.
It's gonna be so weird watching tournaments in the future and not seeing Scump's name there.
"Hero's get remembered, but legends never die." You, my sir, are both. Hope you at least keep us updated on this channel with what you are doing after competing.
😢❤
Chills….
When did @b0aty start playing cod
Bitter sweet, your a goat Seth. Go out with a bang!
I’ll say this if it wasn’t for scump I would have never gotten into the interest of competitive e sports back in the day with bo2 changed how I played games and things I still watch to this day on so many games. I truly think scump had held COD on his back forever and the comp world will never be the same! Can’t wait to see you steaming and uploading after this year
The single greatest to ever do it. From personality to skill. Scump has it all. Truly a legendary player and legendary person 💯
THE GOAT!!! 💯🐐👑💚
The impact this man has had on competitive CoD is and will forever be unmatched. Even his haters will eventually admit that a scene without him will never be the same.
Cod is about to lose the greatest player of all time :(
yall ready know scump boutta be cracked this season
The best to ever do it
Ive started watching you in 2012 and I must say I came a long way with you bro. We grew up and you were my idol for gaming. One of the best GOATS in cod history. Much love bro.
I remember the first time I played against you in a public lobby way back in black ops two. Your team sucked and we almost became friends
Thank you for everything Scumpy! I was once a kid who watched in awwww at you and nadeshot, thanks!

Thank you Scumpii for all the moments. The amount of lifes that you changed cannot be counted. All love from Brazil for real. Thank you so much
Didn’t expect this announcement to make me feel so emotional tbh. Grew up watching you and all the guys at OpTic for 10+ years. 27 years old now, it’s hard to explain how much someone and something means to you that you’ve never even met in person. But it really is a major part of my life. Love you Seth, good luck this year and in the future, LETS GO OUT WITH A BANG 💚💪
my boy
Can I have your channel
😢 Let it end with a “bang bang”
You’re the reason I kept playing cod.. 💔
Ay fam just know u were the best. And will go down as a GOAT. Thx for helping make my childhood. Wish u the best.
I have watched this 20 times,  weird it makes me emotional… so many memories.
You never consider it until it happens. Thank you for everything, man - I hope your next chapter rewards you as you deserve.
Never wanted to see this day come
Dang much love bro, you were the first to get me into comp Cod back in IW

It's not going to be the same without you
I wish it was the last year for cod too
Wtfff
:(
You are the greatest of all time and it’s not even close❤
The King. Forever a legend, this hit hard. Will miss watching you compete. Enjoy whatever you do next, you’ll do amazing!
Fuck yes! DO NOT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOODNIGHT! If this is your last year rage, rage, rage against that dying light. Make it count.
Thank you Scump
NOOOOOOO
Dear scump, i just recently checked who i have been subbes to the longest and i have been subbed to you for 8 years. Longer than any other channel im subscribed to. I wanted to thank you for all the entertainment and hard work you put in over the years. Ive seen the highs and lows. You are the GOAT of CoD in my eyes. Take it easy brother, hope to see more entertaining and wholesome videos in the future. Peace my brother, until next time.
truly the best SuB player of all time. Great career and its been a blast. hope you keep the streams coming. youre character and charisma is unmatched. thanks scump. its been one hell of a pleasure. #ginganinja
Goat of competitive gaming ! 🐐
Been watching you for 9 years got the frameless bottom glasses because of you
NOOOO! My heart. What a legend.
I think I would've actually shed a tear if I wasn't at work around others. Those memories came back of me coming home from school so excited to watch a Scump video
This was an amazing video. Hate the meaning loved whet you have done.
The goat 🐐
Dang man that’s crazy.
❤️
All these terrible games making legends retire…….
cringe
Feel like I just watched a chapter of my childhood close. I now have no desire too watch comp after this year
forever the goat 🐐
I don't play COD anymore, I don't Watch COD anymore but knowing that you wont be competing after this year is a fucking weird ass feeling and I'm sure it is for you too man... one hell of a ride being the best of the best GGs brother. really made my childhood and i think many more could say that too
My 🐐 end of an Era. Love yah scumpii
damn man
This was incredibly emotive. The only reason I know comp cod exists was because I stumbled on your channel back in 2011 or so.
so this is what happens when you get married…
Then this is my last dance with optic too 🥲
Thanks for the memories that we'll never forget
This is the type of shit to make a grown man cry. Praying you pull a Brady and come out of retirement after you win champs this year. We as the community love you big dawg. Go give ‘em hell!💚
Making me emotional give it your best this year like never ever seen before best. At your peak you leave and will be remembered always as the best cod player ever 👍
Hands down the goat no matter what anyones has said will always be the goat
Optic Nation...Let's Ride!!
The fucking 🐐 this is for sure a bitter sweet moment!!!! I've watched your hole career for sure there will never be another scump!!
Nostalgia. This hit me in the feels. I remember when you all lived in the OG Optic house and you had the Hunting optic room with the boys & all the set-ups. I’m 23 now and it’s gone so fast. Green wall, nostalgia💚
I’m. Not. Crying.
🥲🥲🥲
Damn this shit hurt. I don’t game as much anymore but I’ve been watching this man since I was 12 years old I still remember this BO2 days when they all lived the optic house now I’m 21….You were a big part of my childhood Seth I hope you know you’re the reason I got into it competitively and I’ll always remember those videos and MLG tournaments I used to watch like it was football we’re gonna miss you bro 💔 but thank you for all the good memories ❤️
there wont be anyone like you!!!!
The 🐐 One last ride, let's get it king!!!!
The person that got me into cod is retiring thank you for the memories
Scump, you're what got me into CoD. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Let's kill it this year. 💪😭
One more Scar on the tiger, a great chapter on yours and our lives, the goat of CoD and the oldest and greatest org ones created and managed. Just promise us something, at least try to own and dominate the scene one last time, give ur best at comp, no matter results ur already a Myth once written on CoD history, the world is green!!! 💚🖤
Cod must be trash for real
thank you for everything!!|
Damn this made me sad, I always said your last year playing would be my last year watching comp cod because it just won't be the same without you, been watching you since mw2 bro and I feel like I grew up alongside you and the optic boys. Much love and good luck with all your future endeavors, and you will always be the goat Scumpii!!!
Damn I’ve been a scumpy fan forever this sucks man , one last ride my dude
😢❤
bye
Legend
I’m not crying you are
Shout out to the OG optic I miss you mboze and nade becoming an adult is a bitch
Your still the king
A true legend ❤
Damn scump you’re truly an icon bro I’ve been watching since I was 12 I’m 20 years old now man I’ve looked up to you always called myself scrumpy jr as a joke
One last ride ride let go! Been a fan back in bop2 days! YOU ARE THE GOAT!
cod will never be same, goat. hope you can enjoy life as a content creator
I’m not crying
Scump is deadass the Jordan or Kobe of gaming.  Dude had kids trying to push themselves to be something more than just a casual gamer even if they knew damn well they probably couldn’t be but still gave it their best shot regardless
Congrats thanks for the fucking awesome memories now get that last ring and finish on top
Damn hits hard i Hope you win Champs and thank you for everything 🐐
Been following you and the whole OpTic team for many years now ... this really hit home. It's crazy how many people that you've never met, and yet impact their lives in many ways. I remember coming home after school just to watch your latest video, and rewatch the older ones just to reminisce. You really changed the game of CoD and I hope to see you do bigger things in life after your retirement. Thank you for all the countless hours of entertainment and for keeping my younger self engaged. I played competitive because of you. You're loved by many, and your legacy will never die! Bittersweet moment. Enjoy this last season to the fullest, you'll always be the King 👑
G.O.A.T Of The Decade
🐐
If this don't end in the biggest prize it'll be a sad time
My eyes are sweating....
Man this is my childhood loved every second but a new chapter begins
This is the saddest this! I’ve been dreading this day forever
This video is dope
Man this is my childhood loved every second but a new chapter begins
SCUMP, IT HAS BEEN AMAZING WATCHING YOU OVER THE YEARS!! ONE HELL OF A CAREER. LOVE YOU SETH❤
Huge part of my childhood/the reason i watched cod! Can't wait to watch the final season.
The end of an era
I love you Scumpii
Brooo this is difficult, been watching u from Belgium since MW3, thx for everything! So many good memories thanks to you, ur the boss Hope they will always be a website with all the scrims, comps and league for us to rewatch when were in our retirement home
I still remember the day I met you at UMG DC when I was 12 I’m turning 21 in January and stop watching but you literally made the next 3 years of my life after meeting you and getting a pic. Unbelievable I 1v1’d you a week later after meeting you after getting randomly put in SnD Lobby on Bio Lab. We were the only ones in the lobby and you swept me but it’s still something I will cherish forever. Thanks Seth❤️Love You Man
This gave me chills and really hit home for me. It’s honestly been a real pleasure and honor to watch you grow as a player and a person through the years. I’m proud to be able to say I’ve seen it all and in my opinion Scump is the golden era of COD not the game itself. Win or lose this season I will always be a fan and never disappointed.
The greatest call of duty player of all time!!!!!!!
no
"my only regret is not being able to see myself perform live" -Kanya West
Almost cried
The greatest to ever do it 💔💔
What’s next big boy?

WE LOVE YOU SCUMPY!!!!!, You will go down as the best in COD gaming history. End this amazing career in a bang baby! Cannot say this enough but you have been such an inspiration to young gamer's and really proved that anything is possible if its your dream. Love you SCUMP, this year is for you brother. See ya!
Heavy💚 Seth it’s been a pleasure watching you all these years. Cdl will never be the same, but your next chapter is about to be 🔥
King of the Hill
:/
halo next
This gave me goosebumps  You’ve been an icon Goodluck with all future endeavours
It'll never be the same without you, BUT nobody deserves it that much like you :) All the best king 👑👌
From 6050 to now, been a journey man.
For me he is the GOAT the guy that got me into competitive cod
Thank you Scump 🖤💚🤍
Can I dislike this I don’t want this to be true😢
It’s sad to see you go Scump, and even sadder the last few COD games you competed in were choked of fun because of the developers.
Love you buddy!
From my age of 12 you’ve been “the best of the best” in CoD, now here we are at 23 years old and I’m getting to see the end of an era. Really hit me right in the feels, thank you Scump
Grew up watching you, played against you in BO3. Man such an inspiration and one crazy ride you've been on. I hope you win it all homie. Best of luck to whatever you do next Seth, much love.
Damn my inspiration for competitive gaming is retiring. I’ve always wanted to make it in the rosters and end up on a team with the king but seems like I’m too late. It’s all good tho seth. You’ve came a long way yet still felt like you’ve just started. This last year will fs end up in a dub
Goat
Thanks for all the good content ❤
This is crazy! Wow!!!
Made a grown man cry
Man that made me drop a tear
Man I’m really sad that I won’t see you on that stage anymore… it’s been 11 years that a see you there! A wonderful journey, have a last great season man, you deserve it! 🐐
Loved your black ops 3 videos m8!
Noooooooooooooo
Can't imagine competitive without you
Only pro player I followed throughout my teenage years. Legend.
Scump Thank you for everything that u did for the completive cod community we love you and we will miss you a lot. From all the Optic wins back in Bo2 and Bo3 and MW2 and to a amazing performance in vanguard We will appreciate this years COD to you and your amazing career. We love you and ofc LETS GO OPTIC- Lettuce and the Entire Competitive Call Of Duty Community We all love you
Undoubtedly the Goat of COD.
Don’t even play COD anymore I watch your cod gameplays and sometimes your twitch streams simply to remember the days of MW3 and cod 4 when I was in high school playing GBS and doing tourneys the nostalgia just hits different you are a legend Seth and always will be cod won’t be the same but it’s okay because we all grow up I guess! Stay lifted Legend!!
This might be the last season i watch. From watching you on BO2 until now. Cod will never be the same without you.
Wow this really hits hard, he was the only reason I ever really started playing COD 😔
You are a legend✊🏾
Bye Goat 💚💚
The Last Dance.. 😢
The King 👑

The claw kings last ride. we will miss you champ.
Thank you for the memories Scumpii. I learned about optic through you from my older brother. Kick ass this last season
One last ride brother…
Please don’t leave us 😭, specially with this generation of fake “pro” players
Shit made me drop some tears. In my eyes you will always be the GOAT. If you see this Scumpii I thank you for all these years of entertainment and being an inspiration for me. CANT WAIT TO SEE WHATS NEXT.  LONG LIVE THE KING
Time to go out with a bang brotha!!
It might seem crazy for you to think about somebody you never met getting emotional about your retirement… but I just want to express how much watching you compete for over a decade now has meant to me personally! I’ve watched every single call of duty event since black ops 2 and you have personally brought hours of joy and entertainment to me. I respect you and I’m truly saddened by you leaving. You better tear up the competition this year!! I’ll be watching ❤
Oh man I have been an optic fan since BO2 when I was like 13 I’m now 24 … and I still look up to scump .. not like a gamer more like a person who has accomplished a lot …
That halo 2 screen 📺 bought back memories
I was 14 when I started watching. I’m now 20… thank u for brightening my teenage years even when I was going thru a lot. U had a massive impact on me Seth 💚
:( you reminded me of my last year of high school when I was playing bo3 with my little brother our second CoD after AW and the first CoD I watched competitive, loved your pub games on yt and watching you play competitive… when IW came out I wasn’t playing ps anymore I moved to Berlin Germany to study, that year was the toughest  in my life at the end of which I decided to return a failure back home in my country… your videos kept me going in Berlin you were posting bo3 that year too as IW was terrible, which I loved of course, I muat have watched those videos 3 times each… Good luck on your journey Scump wherever it may lead. My favorite moment will always be you vs splyce at the bunker (hardpoint) “stronghold” I think was the name of the map… take care brother and thank you for having the courage to live your dreams and make them your reality motivating thousands along the way! ❤
I almost cried cried 🥹
Fuck this man my eyes watered genuinely
😢
Long live The King
What a masterpiece!!!!! KING! 👑
Sometimes all the good things must come to a end! My gaming career has also dwindled a lot with work and life but sometimes you have to get ready for retirement but it’s never to late for another run with the boys on mw2
Gonna miss you Scump the absolute GOAT of competitive call of duty 🐐 may you relax well Seth !
Man it's been over 10 years since alot of us have been watching your videos. 10 years came Just like that. I loved your BO2 videos, some of the best times in gaming for sure. Congrats on everything you've accomplished and Enjoy this one last go. Looking forward to see what you do after Competitive Cod.
The King doesn't retire. He will ascend into the Godhood Throne of Competitive COD. Long Live The King!
Recuerdo cuando empece a meterme al mundo del CoD, a los primeros que empece a ver fue a Scumpii y NaDeShoT eran unas maquinotas, y actualmente Scump sigue siendo el king! Mucho respeto para ti Scump! Good luck!
It’s like Jeter retirement season. 🫡  SCUMP
LETSSSSS GET CHAMPSSSS BABYYYYY
Scump going to pull a Tom Brady 😏
Nokap u the reason I started playing cod, thanks u scump
Call of duty comp is in for some troubled times
CDL will take a huge hit when he goes. One last right big Scump. You deserve all the rings man.
Hearing the crowd chanting "Let's go optic" brought me back to a pure moment of bliss as I remember the joy of watching optic compete
Start Green, finish Green 🔥
“It is your boy Optic Scumpy!” 💚 thank you Sethy, competitive gaming and just gaming in general is what it is today because of you
Call of duty will never be the same without you.
The goat
Hey Seth, i would like to share a story with you. I have been a fan since 2011. Back then I was no one. Now in late 2022, i am witnessing the end of an era.  I now have been a doctor for more than 6 years, not playîng much anymore, but i still think you played a role in who i am today. Thank you for everything.
Legend. See you around GOAT.
Man, the memories, the challenges, …the glory. Scumpii you inspired a generation and entertained the next one, you’re the reason I starting watching and enjoying professional video games to begin with. Your impact on Call of Duty, YouTube, and gaming as a whole will never be forgotten. Your place can never be usurped. Long live the King. #GREENWALL
💚
👑 of cod
Whats this the 3rd time you retired now? Lol cant wait to see you kill it out there this season🎉
Damn man
This has really put everything into perspective.  From watching back in Black Ops 2 days to now it has been one hell of a ride.  An inspiration to many and i'm sure everyone will be thrilled to see the new projects and content you come out with after the competitive season!
I don't know why but this video makes me sad makes me miss being a young teen again watching and playing every call of duty to one day get into a game with the likes of scump he was an idol to me growing up I have not touched call of duty in 3 years now I lost touch and what it felt like to enjoy it as a whole but I guess that's what growing up is all about get this last W scump for all of us!
Its insane that I watched this man from the start 😢
Im a grown ass man and lowkey got teary eyed 🥺
This really it me
Thank you for all you’ve done Seth, you’ve been such an inspiration for all and I certainly know a main reason why I got into eSports. There are so many childhood memories I have watching you & looking back on it all at 22 now just feels surreal. You have forever changed the CoD community & I thank you for that & all that memories I have from watching your content along w the eSports. Here’s to one last ride, forever💚🍻💨
Someone in the comments said KSG nuclear and my childhood flashed before my eyes.. were now adults and I’ll never get this era of my life back & it makes me sad you’re gonna stop but happy I got to experience you as a content creator & Pro!!! The best ever Scumperjumper 😢❤
Whatever makes you happy scumpy thank you for the memories
The best to ever do it imo You will always be the King inspiring generations of gamers 👑💚🐐
GOAT

the absolute best to ever do it
Damn our childhood really is expiring 😢
Mad how I’ve been around since black ops 2 only binge watching old vids over the last while definitely the end of a era all the best in life
The best gamer to ever live
remember my elementary school days coming back home hopping on my youtube watching these cats play in Chicago streaming in the same room. Saw that perseverance x games was the most satisfying. Bo2 scumpy with the scorpion was godlike. thanks for good times king
Chills
Yo😢 this hurt.. CDL better low key rig this shit so scump gets his 2nd ring!!
Nah bro
Our King!!
No way…
Chills the whole video man, truly an amazing person and player that cannot be replaced
Wow this feels so surreal, I remember back in primary school watching scump everyday. He turned me into the nutty little gamer I am today. We are so lucky to have such a well talented dude that’s brought the sport to where it is today. Big ups to the GOAT. I’m sure all the boys and girls will be there for us well after retirement. Yewwww!!!!!!!
Changed call of duty. By far my favorite pro player. Love tuning into the streams💚💚
I grew watching you and loving cod! Always will love the memories you've shared and created with us!!!
The absolute GOAT. It’s been awesome watching you compete all these years! Go out with a BANG!
Your going to be missed scump the man the myth the legend I can not believe this 😢
Wow
Who the fuck produced this video absolutely amazing
Nooooooo
It’s never goodbye
But the title is meant to be two years. Youre breaking the system brother lol
about to go out on top couldn't go out a better way
This is the only bit of content which you have produced that I want to dislike. I've followed your entire career and I can safely say that the community will be lost without the king! The one true GOAT, best of luck this season big man!
😢no
Lets be honest we had this coming, still amazing vid
I love you scump thanks for everything , make this last ride crazy !!!!! Optic forever
Noooooooooooooo
Chicken fucken skin

Overrated asf
The greatest, won’t be quite the same without you❤️
the king is laying his crown down 😔
Thanks for the good moments bro love u happy gonna see last ride
LEGEND
The King 👑💚
You are the definition of a prime player. On their day you can not compete. That was Seth "ScumpiI" Abner.
Last year I am watching competitive!!!
LETS GET THIS LAST RING LETS GO MAN!!! 🔥🔥🔥 end it with a banger
Man his eyes are even colored the same as optic like he was born for this team.
To think, it all started in the original modern warfare era for scumpii, now hes come full circle and ending his career where it all began. Fucking tippable of the King himself. Excited to see what comes from the King next!
It's crazy how time flies. I started playing COD in 2010 (I was 14). One of my favorite Call Of Duty YouTubers at that time was TheMarkOfJ (he left YouTube last year). Whenever TheMarkOfJ would upload videos showing his stats in each COD game, Scumps name was right there above his on the leaderboards. When I thought of MLG, Scump was the first name that came to mind. He even inspired me into wanting to become a professional COD player. This video just brought back a lot of good memories. Hopefully you'll still upload content as a YouTuber
We love you scump! I been a fan since day one. IT will not be the same without you! Make the last ride the best one! #GREENWALL
Watch optic gonna win champs and he’s gonna be like ehhhh one more year
It won’t be the same without you
😢😢😢
Scump u were on OG Xbox?! Ha, what a system. Only 4 yrs of amazing games, Halo, Ninja Gaiden, Splinter Cell......and then came the
Why did I almost cry  Love you scump 💚💚
Mans is about to be goin hammer time, don’t blink
My grandpa is about to die and now this
I have to admit that I was a big FaZe fanboy but Scump was always there to entertain when FaZe didn't.
You saw how trash MW2 was and had to retire 🤣. the worst COD of all time, possibly not counting a couple jet pack ones.
Phenomenal edit
The Kings last ride into battle…
ive been dredding this day, my entire life.
I'm not crying! You're crying!
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL VIDEO AND CANT WAIT TO SUPPORT YOU THROUGH YOUR LAST YEAR!

Brooo I️ jus cried
Goodbye legend !!!
You influence so many scump. We love you man ❤ cod wouldn’t be the same without you
The last of the old gods, the King finally passes down the crown after this season. I fell in love with comp cod watching scump and I can’t wait to see what the future holds. Thanks for the memories King
Fuck man…I knew this was coming, but there was no preparation for it. I’ve known about your existence in CoD since 2008, and it’s crazy to see how you helped pave the way for this report to become how big it is now. It’s been a blast, Seth. Good luck to you. #OneLastRide
Love you scum I’ll always remember ya ❤️
It won't be the same without you Seth, ill be tuned in for whatever is next.

Bro ive been part of the Green  Wall for soo long and seeing these memories had me holding back some tears. I'm ready for this last ride! Getting to meet and hang a couple times when you have been in town was great and sad its not possible like before 2020 but can't wait to watch the grind and how this  year turns out! #brickbybrick
Your the king of call of duty, this made me abit emotional, I just remember coming home from school waiting to see your Pub videos on Bo2 and you grinding to masters league. ❤
Grew up watching the king/goat for as long as I can remember. Sad and bittersweet and Congratz on the engagement. This is going to be the last ride for ye old scumpi! Going to miss the energy and vibez from you competing but LFG greenwall finish strong and let’s add a world champ cod title for the king!🔥💯💚

Sad to see the kid go😢. The face of Call Of Duty; a legacy like no other. You will be missed Scumper Jumper. So long buddy, go well this year❤
LETS GO SCUMPPP
Damn I feel old af rn.
Enough to make a grown man cry
Been watching you and following Optic for over a decade. I’m 27 now. you are the goat of esports and I’ll be a fan for life. Hope the team can get some Ws this year
Thats how shit this new cod MWII 2022 😮‍💨😟☹️ cod 📉📉📉📉📉 they see the numbers and now with most of the OG goats gone
A spearhead, a legend and the GOAT.  You're the best thing that happened to Call of Duty.  Thank you for helping create a whole new world for the world.  #onelastride
Actually sobbing, I came over from Halo when Black Ops 3 came out. Fell in love with Optic from the first video. I've watched every single event since then. You've made us all proud to be Optic fans Scumpi, have a hell of a retirement goat. <3
Damnnn. Sad to see my call of duty idle is hanging it up after this year… fun to watch you compete and destroy kids/teams. Much love scump. #scumpii4life
and just like that I’m fuckin crying outta nowhere 😭🥹💪🏾 you’re the GOAT scumpii!! love you bro
Then make it the best damn year. I’ve followed you for a long time and it’s crazy seeing your content and skills grow over that time. Shout out to literally being one of the greatest OG’s
Thank you so much i was a TS not the same but you got me in the game all together thanks for giving me sum to watch when i got off from school now im 23 with a daughter an look back at the good memories and friends it  brought me you are  truly one of the best cheers my friend
Nearly cried and not exaggerating. I’ve been watching you the last 11 years and man it’s gone by quick. You’ve brought many of us joy, motivation and lastly an escape from some of the more surreal things in life. Thank you for always being a buddy. Someone I could watch stream after a tough day at school, someone who made silly content in Russell drive and scuf house, providing content when things were tough during the pandemic. We’ll probably never cross paths, but thank you for everything. It may seem lame and insignificant, but you’ve impacted some of us for simply being you. Thank you
If I am watching OpTic play I am always ready for scump to pop off and show his dominance. I will miss that
I remember watching you play bo2 when I was like 13 years old, and here we are now 11 years later. Not only the goat of cod but the goat of gaming. You have made so many people smile man, enjoy retirement.
i got goosebumps
ONE LAST RIDE
Why though? What have I missed
I want to cry and a pity that nothing is forever
❤❤❤
Pains me man, on to greater things king thanks for the ride
No way bro your the only reason I watch the energy you bring to the game is insane dawg not to mention your funny af your a freak on the sticks you will be missed 😢
When I started watching u I was 12 / 13, now i am 21 going for 22 jesus ur a legend...
we love u scump, the league will never be the same without u
We need more scump for years 🥹
Scump didn’t just change optic , the call of duty or halo community he changed gaming as a whole and he made so many of our childhoods better with his content man. It only serves right he’s going to go out on top the same way he held it down for years
He is trolling
Scump is the reason why I still watch COD today
no nos dejes asi bro haste un chiste o come alitas picantes pa reirme  y como fanatico no te voy a dejar ir solo jaja me retiro  del juego tambien
Godspeed King. Ring 2 on the way
im not crying ur crying
The goat, the legend, the best is retiring. I wish all the best to the best❤️
Wish It was 2012 again watching you compete along with all the other legends from bo2.
I have been watching from the start. I more awesome ride man, I can not wait to see what happens, it was one hell of a career
Never forget the Bo2 after math 3 piece for 20k love you bro
You been my idol for gaming and you are the reason why i started playing cod,halo and other fun games too thank you for giving me the best memories in seeing you compete and demolishing games and tournaments appreciate everything you have done thank you for everything.
Go get 'em.
It’s crazy how people say, “it’s just video games.” This man did so much more than that. Enough to make me emotional watching this. From watching you everyday after school when I was 11, to high school, my time in the military, and now 22 years old. This man provided content through some great times, and not so great times. To say I appreciate you would truly be an understatement. Let’s ride.
I'm 101% Halo player, I don't ever even watch CoD, but since I like Scump's personality a lot this somehow got me slightly emotional too. Probably because I know how much he means to the CoD community. Damn. Well, nothing lasts forever, but I'm sure he will be around working with Optic. GG's, Scumpii.
My name is Seth. I am the same age as you scump for 27 days as my birthday is June 3rd and yours is June 30th. I live in South Jersey in the Philadelphia area. You were in PA close enough to be associated with Philly. I discovered you when I got into cod comp from vids from black ops 1. I saw your insane BO11 essentially reverse sweep win against fear when you were on quantic levereage. Then when I got into comp towards the end of mw3 you were on OpTic. You were the best at the game that I loved. so many things go without saying. You instantly built a connection with me even though you have no idea I existed just from coincidence. Made my smile many times. Thanks Seth
This is a weird feeling 🥹.
I hope Scump goes into devoting his time to full time streaming after retirement and goes into playing variety shooting games. Dude would kill it with his personality.
Chills watching this masterpiece
Scump.....don't call it until your really ready to go. COD is scump and scump is COD....as long as you love the game that you came in dominated all these years then keep the ride going. Unless it's necessary to do so then keep melting these kids lol.
These damn onions man. They get me everytime
Scump is optic and always will be  but with this being his last ride I think competitive COD will leave with him
Ive been watching you since i was 11 years old and now im 20 years old....you will always be better than any OpTic members in my heart Seth...We love you man!💙💙💯💯 #OneLastRide #OLR
I been following you for 10 years now, you have always been a inspiration to my life call of duty won't be the same without you 😣
Sad days 😔
:(
I kinda knew MW2 would be his last hurrah. he gonna catch that tag on his departing flight baby. Long time fan, Never LEFT optic for another fanbase myself. I am so proud of what you have done scump, and I never even knew you.
You are and always will be the GOAT.  Best of luck in this next season, an what ever you choose to do after 💚
And im 100% positiv it will be a good year for you my friend i hav so many good memorys  watching your vids streams and tournaments i learnd so much from you i will allways be thankfull for the childhood you gave me when erver i was down or simply just bored i watch one of you vides and fellt bettet instatly so that why i wanna say THANK YOU on you shoulderd rests a hole generations of young players and proplayers so THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTEM OF MY HEART i will miss you❤️
Bro really has me crying this fool better still make videos with the team
He will be back
NOOOOOOOOooooooooooo *dies*
A king doesn't rule a kingdom forever, But its what that king does that keeps their name to live on forever. You friend for what you done through esports is something this kingdom will always remember. Its been the best run it could of been and excited to watch the last year you compete. King Scump forever!
❤❤❤greatest to ever do it
One of the greatest to ever pick up a controller! Live free and Happy Scumpy!!
The nostalgia when he sat at the plastic folding table....... Man the first optic house was a time to remember. So young, so innocent, nothing but dreams to make come true. Loved every minute of your journey, Seth. Thank you for being such a huge part of my life for so many years. Enjoy Retirement!!!!!!!!!
Go out big with a dub💪
Thank you for the memories Seth.
Im SHOOK
Thank you for being you and for being true to the game! The years watching you have truly been an honor. Optic 4L 💚
Been following Scump since his entry into OpTic. The scene will never be the same. But can we take a moment to give a hand to the team on this incredible video piece? I mean, this might be the greatest piece of content I’ve ever seen created by OpTic.
Mannnnn🥹🥹🥹🥹 I remember watching you and nade in the mw3 days and now this
He was able to live the dream of a lot of kids, playing video games for money. It won't be same without him in the tournaments.
Man this literally gave me the chills…. Literally grew up with you playing COD. Literally it will never be the same… you, bigtymer I won’t watch it now just because of you two gone… I hope you stay in the gaming scene and maybe stream but if not man I hope you the best and maybe time to start a family with the ol lady! Much love man, the GREENWALL is real!!! 💚💚💚💚💚💚
Grew up with this man 🥹, inspired me in many ways.
Please be a troll🥺💚
❤️❤️
The last tournament this man plays in is gonna be a sad day but you bet your ass I’m gonna be there, tissues and all, this man is my childhood and I’ve been dredging this day for a couple years now. #greenwall
damn
Ngl this hits home, grew up watching you compete, kill it this season!
The king is stepping off his throne…….and the throne will remain empty
🐐
So sad to see honestly, you honestly had an impact on my joy and competitive side for gaming in my own world. It was a joy to see you compete and make youtube videos that me and my brother enjoyed. Hope to see a Chip!
Ty for the bo2 childhood :) ❤
Shoutout the editor and camera person! Insane piece of work! GGs!
We are going miss you scump in the competitive side of call of duty your a legend the legacy you leave behind still be alive and remember
All good things must come to an end. On to the next leg of your journey. You're a good dude with a very bright future. Best wishes Scump!
It'll never be the same.
Ugh.... had to come sometime.... the greatest.... I mean the greatest... every pro cod player always compared to scump.... crazy to see this man go
I'm going fucking hard this year. For seth
I cried
End of a Legacy! 🙏
Why am I crying in the club rn
Nearly cried
I give him 6 months top
Took him long enough... This is a waste of time gentlmen. SItting 15 hours a day and getting good at a game that died a decade ago. Time for a new chapter, more gym time, Children, new business new connections. Life is more than your KD.
Legend legend…just legend
Damn bro I remember watching you play bo2 so long ago now. Feels fucking weird i was only 12
damn
*Look at the fuckin scoreboard…*
my childhood fr thank you sethy for everything you've done, truly an inspiration. love u man
I see this pop up at work right now, I’m 19 but when I first watched your Video I was 8 years old wanting to be good at Cod, you’re the reason I even play the game. Such a die hard fan I used to watch the optic house funny moments and scump funniest moments, Thankyou for the memories, Thankyou so much scump..
Ther's news that you knew it will come someday and you don't imagen how hard it hits you in your heart when you realized your childhood is gone as well with the GOAT of COD.
Your The GOAT @scump Wish You The Best Man Been Watching U Since Day 1 & You Have Changed So Many Lives Man And We Appreciate All The Hard Work You Have Done & Busting Your Ass Day By Day To Bring Championships To The #GreenWall & #OpTic 😁.
I hope you win your 2nd ring my man you deserve it
You changed gaming and the way I approached cod since black ops 2, and I know others feel the same. You're the goat and will be the king forever! #Greenwall

It has been quite the ride Seth!
Crying in the club
👑👑👑

<3 Been watching you forever scump! Give them hell this year!
We love you brother. Been watching from the beginning, living just outside Chicago and the green wall, absolutely inspirational career! The positive attitude you carried throughout was amazing as well. We love you and can’t wait to see what you do next💚
damn 😔
I would never forget the first video that I’ve watched of you, you’ve been my childhood since I was a kid you’ve been my idol since I was 13 and now I’m 26 this is going to be so hard for me, your going to be missed king 😔💚love you brother💚
Man 😪 I shook your hand at CWL Dallas in WW2 it was a crazy moment seeing you and knowing that you knew nothing about me but I grew up watching you so you didn’t feel like a stranger to me…I‘ve been here since the beginning pretty much and I’m 24 now and we’re really moving with the seasons cause this doesn’t feel real just yet.
love you bro, you've brought so much joy and entertainment to a ton of people. let's get one last dub.
it's ya boy OpTic Scumpii
Noooooo bro why did this make me tear up man
Scumperjumper been here since the start man Brought a few tears to my eyes. Such a legacy ! Much love from me and mine
I thought he was about to say that he wouldn’t be competing this year. Let’s go scump.
Great career bro. Hope you will stick around YouTube, I’ll seeeee ya.
Don't leave 😢
One last dance for the king 👑
Wow... The impact you had on gaming is insane. Good luck to you on your future endeavors! #GOAT
Nooooooooooooooooo
Best of luck King Scumpii 👑🫡
⬆️💥🥲
Long live the king💚
The chills man been watching u for over a decade I’m 20 now feels like I grew up with u and the rest of the green wall congrats on a phenomenal career king scump legend forever
:(
❤️
Thank you Scump. COD will never EVER be the same. YOU are COD
This one is going to hurt boys!
Why did I tear up. Help
Wow man been watching you since I was atleast 10 or 11 years old and I’m now turning 21 congratulations  Seth Best of this Era.
Thank you for everything Seth! Truly! What a legend man 💯
Ngl, I've been waiting for Scump to retire from comp so that he can do fulltime (or at least more part time) streaming. I lost interest in competitive COD during WW2 so I've been patiently waiting for years...
As cliche as it is to say, the competitive scene would not be where it is today without this man and the teams Optic put together. From the janky ass LAN setups to a multi-million dollar main stage and acceptance of competitive gaming as a whole, thank you for all the great years!
This is literally giving me chills
Green wall will miss you brotha💚
What a outro for your last ride!  Get the ring on your last ride
Scump, thanks for the memories my man.
And there goes my last reason of watching competitive cod loved seeing you play and hope you can bring it home one last time
noooooooooo
my idol 😩
The ginger ninja will be forever
We’re getting old scumpii been a long ride, can’t wait to see you boom in the full time streamer.
This was incredible
The Goat 💚🤍🖤
Ima cry for real 😢
I could literally cry right now, I'm so happy you're not tapping out yet, been an OpTic supporter/fan since the sniping days and have been following the content since before the OG OpTic house, this shit took me on a wild ass rollercoaster but I'm super happy there's at least one more year in the tank
😭, my childhood 🥺
❤
dude, the fucking king. 💚

The GOAT 🐐
Scump the goat. No doubt about it 🐐
Nooooooo 😢
Emotional damage 💔

The greatest a legend grew watching him
We'd probably have another few years of our boy at least if these games haven't become so insufferable.
💚💚💚
COD is going to die down scump is the reason why we all watch competitive COD 😂
LEGENDS NEVER DIE 💚🤍💚🤍
damn congrats ON THE RETIRMENT hope you come back at somepoint IN THE FUTURE for just for shits and giggles watch ya before i started to play Cod and you and OPtic made it fun and interesting to play some competitive BO2 League Play wish I could have seen ya compete.

The best and most humble guy who ever played this game 🐐🐐🐐
End of an era 😢 absolute legend all the best for you're future and hope you sign off in style it's been an honour you're majesty
Respect brother heres to 1 more :)
Okay who’s cutting the onions in here
getting off of school to watch your BO2 videos was one of the best highlights of my teen years! Thank you for everything King Scump!
Imma miss this kid :(
As a fan who has had countless teams suffer at Scump's hands, I've got nothing but respect for the king and what he's done for the game.   Long live the 🐐
I been following this beast since I was like 17... I'm 28 now. So many memories too many to name, but never forgotten. Salute to you scumperjumper🤝🏿👏🏿
6 years ago I was looking up pro COD players to see how good they were. I’m 38 now and it’s been a blast watching you and optic. Good luck man.
One last ride and one last chance to show the competitive COD scene who the f*ckin KING of Call of Duty is! We’re all behind you. You got our support. Time to make some noise and go out with a bang. LFG! #BrickByBrick
wow man, what a fucking journey
Possibly the greatest YouTube video I have ever seen. You’ll go down as the best !!
Much love to ya Scump  It's been a hell of a Ride, and can't wait to see what comes next   Always been one of my favorite players to watch and keep on doing what you do best    Also Optic is my favorite teams in all Cod and been a fan since back in BO2 ish    Much love to all of Optic
Thhhee ya! ❤
omg my childhood all the optic guys out of the league next year got me crying in the club rn
Ledgend, hope too be that  good
Thank you so much Scump for the unbelievable memories over the last decade+!! Totally sad about your retirement but you 100% deserve it brother! Thank you Optic and thank you Greenwall! "UNITED 👏👏👏 UNITED!!!!"
Why ?
happy to have lived this era of gaming
I was hoping you’d at least stay to the end of trayarcs game but with the 2 year cycles I don’t expect you too . Can’t wait for the content after man ❤️
Watching this at 29 years old also makes me want to put my controller down and finally let go of cod 😢
Crazy how all these years have gone so fast
A wise man once said don’t be sad it ended, be happy it happened….. thank you for the best childhood scumpiiiiiiiii
Wow. What a way to make this announcement. Incredible. One last ride, Scump. It's been an honor to watch you over the years. Excited for this season and what lies ahead for you.
Im glad you announced this, you deserve a goodbye tour on some Kobe vibes. Legend
one of if not the best comp cod player
goosebumps
PERFECTION!!
Forever the GOAT
Cod is ass and it's making him retire. Shit is sad, CDL is done for. This man use to grind for camos and nukes and would hold up scrims/matches during the golden era of cod leading up to ghost. He never had that same fun ever since all the elite devs left cod and they brought in these trash ass devs that's made the last 9 cod titles. I wish they would make games like the golden era so he can stay. Lets be real, his age is absolutely not the issue here at all, he could play for another 2 decades if he wanted to. His skill won't slow down at all, this isn't the NBA/NFL. Shit is sad asf that this will be his last year cause of this shitty ass company in activision hiring trash ass devs to run Cod into the fucking ground and below.
T2P for ever 🖤
Damnn bro this hit hard. I'm gonna miss the ginga ninja, I've been watching him since 10 years old now I'm in my 20's words can't describe how I feel ATM, to a better future Sethy seth!!
bouta cry
Much love scump! I just want to say simply, thank you! Lot's of great memories and fun. Thanks.
This reminds me of Kobe Bryant's retirement ad for Nike
I’m not crying bruh I’m just cooking and Onions are in the recipe
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Damn what a way to start the weekend but I understand and at least he’s giving us 1 last year so much love and appreciation for what this man has done till this day I see myself going back to his Bo2 videos because it just reminds me of me when I was younger #TheGoat
Ily
🐐
I’m going to cry 😢💚 I can’t imagine competitive call of duty without you scump I’m going to miss you so much 😔💚 I love you so much Seth 💚💚
All hail the king!
You made my high school life bearable!! Started as a fan in 2013 and will be one for the rest of my life! Thank you for the memories Scumper Jumper
Bro, I almost cried though he was retiring!
Man this is crazy I've been watching you since day one and to hear you say your retiring is heartbreaking you have inspired me to play an play an keep my dream up WE the community is going to miss you
COD Country, Lets Ride !! 😎 grew up watching this guy, hats off to you.
im crying🥺
Sad part is I think he would still keep playing if It wasn’t for cod being so bad every year and not as much fun as it use to be. The developers have completely ruined the experience and have done nothing for competitive cod in a very long time. They don’t realize the talents and fanbase they are losing because of their ideas and horrible execution of a game that company’s dumped millions into for a solid competitive future.
NOOOOOO
No bro please my childhood isn’t ready for this.
Defs end of an era 😢
Wishing you absolutely nothing but the best. Competitive cod will never be the same without you. Been my favorite YouTuber/player since I was like 11 years old. I just turned 24.
Scump, what in the f****** feels just happened in this video :( Read these comments. Soak it all in. Thank you!
Will forever be the best🐐
Dang, this and Drift0r’s announcement.   Has it really been more than 10 years watching both of you?  Way to make me feel like I’m really 33.   Watching you guys even to this day brings me back out from the stressors of the real world.   It was a wild ride, get that last W.
Ahhhh man I could write so many things...grew up watching you scump all the way from BO2 to now..I’m 26 with a family and every time I watch you it takes me back to the good old days when you just started your career and I fell in love with COD. Respect to you and everything you’ve done scumpii you deserve everything life has to offer brother❤️
One of the best COD players to come. Enjoyed watching you on BO2 so much and trying to grind for master league.
OpTic just won COD Champs gg game is already over before it started
Amazing career Scump. All the best brother 😢
😮😢❤
The best. Won't be the same with out you
Wow this made me tear up. It's crazy to think about how long I've been watching the goat.
Video games keep us young at heart. Never grow up
Scump, I’m almost brought to tears by this, sometimes we take legends for granted until it’s all said and done but you will forever be a goat to me! Best of luck to you on your last go around, I know it’ll be one for the books!
Thank you man, such an inspiration. 🐐
what a badass video a work of art
I’d say you were my childhood, but I’m 56…. Haha. Still, that hit me in the feels young gun. The scene will not be the same without you, though I think that though your shoes are perhaps a little to big to fill, there are some killer players out there so we should be in good hands. Anyway, I hope you will still stick around in some way as cod is just that much better with you in it, even if it’s just streaming, coaching, running a team or whatever. Thanks for the vibes King.
I hope he can go out with a champ win, really deserve it! king of cod
One of the most beautiful videos I have ever seen. Even though I knew what it was going to be, fully emotional
Legend
You’re a legend already Scump! You will be missed but not forgotten! Godspeed on all your future endeavors, whatever that may be you will succeed so enjoy your next chapter. In this new chapter, whatever it entails I hope you dominate it like you always have. Wish you the best my friend, and cheers to a successful career! Much love my friend.
Let's run it back, Scump! Forever the king! ❤️
Dont go.... please
Im not going to lie. I really did get emotional after he started walking to the different consoles, I've grown up along side scump and watched him play competitive cod since his start.  Thanks for all memories scump.

Crazy because I’m 23 years old now and watched you at 14/15. I don’t watch your videos anymore but appreciate everything you’ve done for the COD Community. Still remember that Sweatbannin’ vid, it was fucking wild.
When you're almost 30 and your deceased best friend told you to make YouTube videos or montages at early MW2 years and didn't take the opportunity. Thank you Scump for being the 🔥 that I never was.

Well boys…it’s finally here. The end of the era.
As others have expressed, this feels like a chapter of my life coming to an end as a 28 yo that’s been watching Scump routinely since Ghosts. I wish nothing but the best for King Scump and the Optic brand going forward. I reflect on the good times but look forward to what’s next.
The soundtrack was SPOT ON.
The King forever ❤️
nobody better than scump not even close
I will miss you Man there was not a single video of you than i haven’t watch … The best COD player 🙏 thank you
Dude... 😢
From the start until the end 💚
I'll always love you scump you were the reason I started to compete and push myself to be better. You're  the reason I build a team to get to 9th on the gb ladder. You're the reason I love CoD. You're the reason I strive to win every single day. You'll never know how much you have affected everyone around you but you are the greatest to ever do it. NO CONTEST. Enjoy this year G.O.A.T. I'll be to an event I promise

I’m happy for you brother, but I would be lieing if I said I didn’t have tears in my eyes. You are already missed and fuck anyone who feels different.
I enjoyed watching you thru the years, good sir.
Fak no, you ain't going nowhere...

Undisputed goat

I'llllllll, c ya! :(
This isn’t a YouTube video, it’s a short film
Ggs to comp cod. Its a lot of fun to watch but without all the true ogs and the games going the way they are thats it for me... Scump you're the goat, hope you have an amazing last season and enjoy your well earned retirement.  Ggs to all the ogs too. I'm just glad I watched comp cod in the golden years.
Legend in the gaming world! Learnt a lot from watching your videos.  Lets get scump in everyones clan tags!
My childhood coming to an end😢
I knew this day would come eventually. But i never expected it to be around the corner already. I'm just a few months younger than scump is, but I've followed your journey all the way from when i discovered you in mw3. Followed your content and tournaments for days, weeks an months on end. Scump and optic became some sort of daily routine. A staple in my youth.  Now that I'm an adult and Scump announced his retirement. I came to realize that I'm no longer young.   I thank you for every single minute of enjoyment you've given me for the past 11 years. Through highs and lows for the green wall.  Thank you king 👑
🐐
That moment you realize it’s not 2010 anymore.. black ops isn’t the call of duty anymore.. and scump is retiring. My heart.. the grief.
Love you scump. Been on this ride with you since the start.  26 now... and this hit me like a kid! Wish you the best this year and also wish you the best in life with your wife to be and future life together <3
as a die hard faze fan, you are one of if not the best cod players. Countless memories and moments you gave us in cod. You are what is means to be a Cod player. We wish you the best.💚
You are a fucking Legend and you always will be!
One of my worst nightmares have come to reality I'm gonna miss you man 😭
You're a legend Scump. NEVER Forget that!
💚💚💚💚
It won’t be the same without u. The new generation of players will never amount to ur energy & level u played at. There will never be someone more entertaining to watch streams videos & LAN events. Thank u for inspiring me to play competitive video games; thank u for paving the way for young players & thank u for being an awesome role model to all around the world   We thank u!!!!
Absolute g hopefully he knows how much we appreciate him he’s the best cod player just sad to see an era go we can all say that coming home from school and watching him drop nukes in pubs was always good too watch then you would try copy and reliased it takes talent to do.
27k likes and 35k views... probably the highest like to view ratio I've ever seen, even though this was just posted
One of the best Call of duty player ever. You finished an amazing carrer. CONGRATS SCUMP!!❤😉
Been watching the whole ride. Your skillset and the way you grew as an commentator was spot on man. You are my most viewed player. Did good Seth, finish with pride and dominance! The GOAT!
The GOAT Scumpi 🐐, ever since I discovered you many many years ago I've just been amazed and entertained ❤️ thank you.
The video editing on this is actually insane. This is so sad. The best to ever play call of duty. No-one compares to scump. Anyone know his reasoning?
This hit me right in the feels. This is some quality editing/scenery like when I used to go to the movies with a girlfriend or my buddies and saw an amazing movie trailer. Man, so many memories of amazing plays, both alone and with the friends, and of course watching tons of it on YT. MW3 and BO3 were my all time faves for pubstomping. BO4 was my last one and after that I pretty much quit, since BO3 was the last real masterpiece/peak of CoD and then it started crumbling away into bad release after bad release. Played quite a bit of warzone but then got tired of the constant platinum lobbies and never ending cheaters. We're all gonna miss watching Scumperjumper scrimming and playing some good ol' CoD :'( The best days are behind us, wish CoD wouldn't have fallen off, (it didn't have to), but boy what a ride it was.
Comp wont be the same with out you
You was the one bro, luvs from Holland
Am not crying you are! 😫😢
love you man
Scump needs to pull an MJ and tweet “i’m back”
Bro I got chills the whole video bro❤😭
My god the feelings right now. Make it the best year ever!
Can't believe this is happening 😮! I've been watching u for soooo long and I'm so sad to be hearing this news that this ur your last year. U will & you are a legend you will always be thought about ❤ thanks
NOOOOOOOOOOOO, been a damn good run. Been watching since mw2. Hope to see you compete at least one time before your done.
Actually the greatest🫡
I remember watching you and taking a picture with you at the Orange County fair like 5 years ago. Absolute legend 🐐🔥❤️
The most influential player of all time
Let’s make this last ride one too remember
He’s going to halo 😂
Growing up with Scump over all these years and idolizing him, watching him grow to the person he is now. Mannn….. this is a bitter sweet moment seeing all you’ve accomplished dude. Bring home one final chip and submit the legacy as for sure the best CoD player to ever play the game. 🏆
Sad moment..
Might 😢 when he retires the stuff he has done over years was magic 🤧🫡 to u king scump
Thanks bro for all the amazing years you have given us as a cod community and hope you kill it in your next endeavor.
🥲
Best of luck
Peter Parker
Why am i crying
The forever King 🤴
Damn you are a legend!!!! good ole ginga ninja
We will miss you King Scump. Until we meet again in Valhalla. 😢❤
The best to ever do it. 10 years watching This man becoming King. For me bo2 ,IW and BO3 were the best content i have ever seen and enjoy to watch. Thank you for all the effort and passion to create endless content for all of us. This year the champs its coming home.
As a 33 year old man this made me sad
Man, it's been a pleasure to watch over the years. Congrats on an unbelievable career. You touched so many lives along the way and were an inspiration to so many gamers out there. An absolute legend and the King of COD. Wish you all the best in retirement
i deadass teared up when scump started talking. gonna miss watching Comp Cod without you
Started tearing up a wee bit, this video is amazing for Scumps legacy. Knew the time would come eventually, all of the players I watched growing up are all retiring and living their lives now. Don't think we'll ever have someone as important as Scump in the scene 💖
i remember watching him as a kid
"We've come a long way" <3
🐐🐐
Even though I knew it was coming, im still so shocked and sad :(
Wow, this was beautiful.
Jesus, time flies. Goo luck scumpi dumpy
Dammm one last run , this cut deep ,no matter how you finish your last season you have always been the 🐐
:( what a career king
The 🐐 💚
ONE LAST RIDE
Thhhhhheyyyaaaaa
No shot
Got goosepumps, of sadness....
Much love and thank you for everything
This was beautiful brotha. I love the story
thank you for everything. My ex boyfriend loves you so much and throughout our whole two years, he ALWAYS looked up to you. I’m so glad and grateful to God he met you before you left. I was so glad and grateful for supporting your journey but he saw you as a GOD man. All these memories happened for a reason and thank you.
This actually makes me so sad. I don't even really watch competitive anymore but the memories of watching you play will stick with me forever.
Why quit after all the hours you spent to perfect your Profession?   Tom Brady,  Lebron, and Jordan stayed as long as their bodies and minds who handle.   Those are what makes Goats The best. #LoveofTheGame
Chills
Good luck scump. You made a mark in the COD community. For dang sure
Idk what hurts more rn, the fact scumpy is quitting cod or the fact I broke my casserole dish full of buffalo dip 🤣🥹
My favourite player of all time!!
We'll miss you
Please❤🥲🥲😭
We love you, bro. We really do.
Damn 💔 one last ride 🥲
The last real OG in the league 😢😢
Man, this really htis home. Your videos with Matt on Bo2 league play are what helped me become addicted to the competitive nature of video games. Industry ins't going to be the same without you man. All love
“IM THE BEST IN THE GAME” True legend thank you Scump
Bye buddy
It was one of the best runs in all of COD history man I've been watching since bo1 and you have done a lot throughout your career man fr best highlight tho is who's the best in the game baby go out with a banger man
Fire vid
Bow down before the king 🫡
first ever favorite player. still my favorite player.
Damn this made me emotional. Ive been feeling like i overstayed my welcome with cod for years now, and this just cemented it for me
NOO
No way!!!
Scump... I have followed you since you first joined optic. You have been and continue to be one of the main pillars for Optic. You have provided so much in the way of entertainment both on and off stream. Your love for the game, and the love you have for your teammates both old and new is inspiring. Thank you for the many years you have put into your craft and I wish you nothing but the best in your retirement. It is well earned, and at the end of your last season, I hope to watch you walk away with another ring. I hope you take in every tournament, every LAN, every practice and let it resonate. I hope you think about it and realize that YOU helped build competitive Call of Duty to where it is now.
I've been watching you since black ops 2...I hope you still stay part of the scene in some way, shape, or form...
My dream is to play 1 game against you brother. Love you man. My childhood, so happy to see you strive in your career. You did amazing man. Bless you. Hate to see you go!
Noooooooooo, comp cod dies with scump

Scump, i started watching you back in the MW3 year as a 14 year old kid. Im now 25 going on 26 and I just found out I’m having my first son. I just wanted to thank you for being an inspiration to so many of us and being a good role model for many of us in the community. For many of us, we feel like we got to grow up with you and we all matured and grew as people together. It’s been amazing watching you compete and grow up. Thanks for the memories and for always carrying the competitive CoD community. You’ll be missed, but I know we’re all excited to see the what’s next. Good luck in your final season, King.
This was a dope video weelllseeeyya

This really hit me in the feels. The end of an era.
I had tears in my eyes this was my childhood only other time I have fault like this with sports is Kobe retirement and then death
Riding towards the sunset! LFG! 🤘🏼
Short and sweet. Thank you brother for everything you gave us. The memories, the moment, and the championships. Without you and optic my childhood probably would have gone way different and I might have never gotten into gaming the way I did. Legends never died and people will probably tell their grandkids stories about you!
Damn man I grew up watching you it’s just crazy we’re getting old
At least do it at 2025 bo2
Dudeeeeeeeee
You changed the game my man, touched so many hearts along the way. Never wanted this time to come but I’m glad it lasted this long! Always kept your composure, got me through the pandemic watching scrims. Thank you for the memories scump. It was incredible to be able to witness. I look forward to seeing what you do next! 😢 definitely bittersweet
Beast of a player them memories felt like yday bo1/bo2
Scumpy will forever be the face of CoD
🥲
What a heartfelt touching video. Scump you are insane dude and I cant wait to see whats to come down the road

Mannn❤️❤️❤️

The goat fr
Damn kinda hits hard 😢
Legend !!! Mad RESPECT... hope we see more of you outside the pro scene!
Yo Scumpii, better off Seth. Thank you for making the little kid as I was a COD gamer and someone who loved the sport because of you..  For all the amazing moments, clips, montages, etc. Everything you did for us as kids was actually inspiring. You are forever the GOAT of COD in my eyes and I just want to thank you for letting us all witness greatness on the big stage.  Thank you for letting us all believe we have a little Scumpii within us all...  P.S.- Were both born on June 30th lol totally random and nothing relative to the point haha but thanks for being you fam <3   OpTic out :)
I cried watching this, your an inspiration! Thank you to Bo2 also for being the best game ever and bringing the gaming community together
I’m so sad 😢.
Scump nadeshot was the best puo off all time, even in Minecraft. Xx
Dam hope you guys get another trophy.
You are literally my childhood
Cod will not be the same
Literally the only reason why I watch cod. This guy is a legend. Not all super heroes wear capes
GOAT
The goat of the call of duty gaming scene
This brought f*ckin tears to my eyes! Nothing but respect for scump and the green wall.
Absolute legend.
Shit ma 😢
His bo2 vids were the best
Man the 6050 setup hit me hard
🤠🤝🏼
You had a good run Legend💚
❤
Love you Seth
It’s good to see it all close on a good note. CoD will never be the old style CoD that was good for competitive games and fun Arena style matches. Hell after BO2 the meta changed so much for gameplay that it just didn’t feel the same and it hadn’t really gotten better imo. It was a fun ride and though I stopped watching around BO3 era it was great to see the overall growing of you and those around you.
So many legendary moments from such a legendary human being. Your legacy will forever live on. Thanks for all the years and best of wishes for what comes next 🙏🐐❤
Hacker
man i actually teared up bro, this is legit my childhood hanging up the hat.
it truly is the end of an era. good luck brother! you will do even better things in life!
Been watching your videos since bo2, what a journey. Definitely the G.O.A.T of cod.
So many stories end with yours… make it a good run and take home that Ring! Thank you for soooo many good moments. I was afraid this day was coming and here it is😢. Much love for you King.👑👑👑
Goosebumps man, ur an absolute legend.
Imma cry bro damn my childhood went to fast
Thank you for your commitment to cod scump. You’ve played a crucial role to getting cod to where it is now. Give it your best! And we optic fan will root for you until the very end. Make sure to wrap this year with a banger
The fucking GOAT!!!!!!!💚🖤💚🖤
Chills watching that
End of an Era. Won't be the same without you Scump. 🐐
We love you Scumpii!! You changed video games for a lot of us and are definitely a huge reason as to why the COD, video game and streaming community is where they are today.
The gist man cod comp won’t be the same 💯
All I can say is thank you, King <3 Thank you for over a decade of some of the best CoD gameplay ever. LONG LIVE THE KING!!!!!
I will forever miss you 👑 SCUMP
Wow
The G.O.A.T. forever and always.
Aight time for formal to come back
This almost brought me to tears.
Damn… this hit the feels. Life is really going by. Love you Seth and all of optic, y’all are really a part of my life. Will always be here to support whatever endeavors you embark upon💪🏽
Wow! Congrats on an awesome career and thanks for the memories, good luck on your next journey!!
Always Sweatbannin’
Will always be the King!!! Cod ain’t gonna be the same with you gone. Thank you for everything you have done and accomplished, gonna miss you GOAT
Why did this make me so emotional. I wasnt even here for his beggining or the middle just the past year and a half. bro what the heck
This video is beautiful. We love you king👑 ONE. LAST. RIDE.💚🖤

I’m 20 years old now. I was once a child in 6th grade cheering for you Scump. You’re forever a legend.
Won’t be the same without scump 🟢⚪️

Thank you for everything that you have given us the green wall over these past years. Your the goat and will always and forever be the goat thank you!
cross map kills with the scorpion
Man I feel old
Best cod player the g.o.a.t
The best to ever do it!
Was never big FaZe or Optic fan in general but this is an end of an era
Thank you man, for everything. I've never wanted to see someone go out on top as badly as I want to see it for you. I will be crying no matter what after COD champs this year. I just really hope It's cause I'm watching you lift the trophy.  Been here since 2011 and I'm 25 now. Truly was my childhood.
One last dance… let’s get em boys
Well we know who has to win COD Champs this year...
I'm not crying, its the allergies
The True GOAT
that shit trully hurts... my whole childhood ... thanks for all the memory's and i'm looking fowards to see you compete one last time... GO OPTIC
Thank you for everything man. At 26 years old this is kinda making 😢 up. Thanks for the memories man. Well deserved retirement coming up
What an amazing nostalgic video scumpy! the progress is actually surreal!! I'm glad you were blessed in this life and I can't wait to watch your growth
👑
You’ll be back scump. Some of the games coming up you’ll be too good at to not compete
💚
The best to ever play the game 💚🙏
Haven’t kept up with Scump the way I’m sure most people here have but I’ve definitely seen him my fair share throughout the years especially bo2 days. This is crazy cuz I’ve been on a Scump video montage lately. Respect for his decision tho
Couldn’t have expected a better video. Perfection.
Since back in BO1 you’ve been nothing more then an icon to this community. Thank you Scump for the some of best times of all time. It really is an end of an era. Hope to see you around the community for much longer. Let’s get one more chip KING!
🙏
I honestly had chills for 15 seconds after this… I grew up with this man as many of us did. From the KSG nuclear, sweatbannin’, WSOW Solo dolo win, and everything in between…. You brought a decade of memories to this nearly 29 year old. Hats off to you, Seth. Let’s ride.
You joked me I thought he was done
😢
In my opinion the founding father of league play, especially bo2
the nostalgia & stories surrounding this entire CDL season is insane. maybe this will give the team extra motivation, to want to give the king a well deserved second ring. god we are going to miss you sethy.
😢😢
THE KING OF COD
One of the greatest to ever touch the sticks
End of a beautiful era! Been watching Scumpii since bo1 days.. we all knew this day would come! Thank you for all the impact you’ve had over the years for the comp community of Call of Duty. Let’s win your last year. 🥹💯
The King Retires ❤️
god i miss the old days...
Not gonna lie i got chills watching this
He won't last the year with the absolute state of this new cod game..... laughable attempt at a cod release. Wow.... Amazing video though. What a legend!
Scump should retire at the age of 30 he still young…
Where real men cried
Mannnn😢😢😢😢😢
There's no shot scump is retiring this season! WHATTTTT! Honestly, you will remain KING even after you leave the esport community and your name will reign terror forever and ever! I wish you all the best in your future endeavors!! I have been watching you from the start and I'm glad I can be there at the end! #kingscump
All  good things come to an end
W
Beautiful video
🐐🐐🐐🐐
Got the biggest chills ever… best to ever do it
🐐🐐
Thanksss scumpi
Damn nadeshot first now it’s u my guy u def da reason I stomp on heads now ✊🏾
BRUUHHHHHH!! That was so dope!! Thank you for all the memories and everything that you brought to the game of Call Of Duty!! You will be missed King!! 💚🙌
Love you Seth ❤️❤️❤️
Won’t be missed
Oh come on man..." you sacrificed"?   Where? I would kill to be able to play at your level. To get famous for playing video games. To get rich for playing video games. To do WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO because you play video games. I work my ass off 60 hours a week and I'm homeless. Haven't seen my son in a year because I have no home to bring him to.
Thank you Seth for all the memories you gave us in CDL now what we saying 1 last trophy to have the perfect send off?
A True Legend.
If it wasn’t for you and Nade! You guys completely changed my child hood! I’m gonna miss watching you compete after this!
Forever the cod goat
I'M LITERALLY CRYING RIGHT NOW!!
I remember the birth of Scumpii... never thought I'd see the end champ. GG
Thank you, beyond words, for the good memories. Been watching pubs since BO2 and comp since BO3, it's been a hell of a ride brother. That's my 🐐 💚 #GREENWALL
Bring back nade lmao
The end of an era 100% gl this year and in the future 🙏
Thank you for the journey we all endured since i was 13 when l scump won his first championship now i am 23 and this video hits so hard in the feels     THE KING WILL STEP DOWN FROM HIS THRONE BUT THE CROWN REMAINS
Im literally crying, im happy for u but we will miss you in CDL, out man Scump "the king"

K I N G
Dramatic
Sheds a test 😢
your the best in the game.💛
King of Cod
Lets take home that ring Scump!
thank you for everything, looking forward to the next chapter of Scumpii
Legend
I’m not crying, you are 🥲
LEGEND!
The greatest to ever do it, you've impacted millions of lives in ways you probably couldn't even imagine. Huge respect and credit to you for all that you've achieved and staying true to yourself all of these years. The fact that your youtube profile image hasn't changed in over ten years is a prime example of that. Never change Scump, I saw this post notification come up and thought "surely this is cap?!" just to find out its not. I've been watching your shit since I was 12 and i'm now 23,  so this is big news for me personally but i'm just glad i was part of it and got to witness your progression/journey. Best of luck in whatever you choose to do after competitive gaming Seth, millions, especially the OG fans will feel the impact of your "retirement" and you'll leave a void that will never be filled, but, life goes on...Theeya!
Let's get the job done bro. For the dubs 💚
I remember so much from Black Ops 1 to you leaving for Nv for 2 weeks, all the challenge videos and Winning Champs. We will miss you 🐐
Sad smh but we got shotzzy
What a Goat man
lets end this on top man  <3
This was amazing. Thank you for the memories, the journey and all the thrills. May your new journey bring you peace. LFG 1 LAST RIDE!!
Gonna be 40 one day looking at these vids 🥲
You shaped how people play cod today. I really hope you'll continue to make videos on whatever game you play. Loved watching you growing up an enjoyed meeting you at CDL for WW2
the best to over do it!
Thank you for everything
I'm not crying 😭
the fucken chills 🔥🔥
Im not crying you are 🥺
💚💚💚
One last ride 🫶🏼
The king
Absolute chills
He’s not the most recognizable, nor famous esports player in COD history. In fact, he’s pretty overrated and not memorable. Regardless, he will be missed. He’s a legend.
I knew it was going to happen after that damn proposal 😑😭😭😂😂 I’ve been riding with you since GB days. Congratulations on a successful career ups and downs you were a leader from the start. All hail King Scump #ForeverOptic #ForeverGamer #ForeverKing
That gave me goosebumps
Could have been a great video but instead it was a bunch of advertisements and logos taking away the focus of it
Dude I’ve been rewatching old black ops 2 videos this week and now you hit me with this 😢
💚💚💚💚
why am i sobbing..
Please be a retired video so you can be full time content creator cause we miss the road to masters and 70.
going to miss king 👑 scump 😭
HALL OF FAME LEGEND
Green Wall for LIFE🥹
Damn I won’t lie. I’m was never ready for this day. Still one of the biggest reasons I fell in love with CoD. It might sound stupid but Scump & Nade were like the MJ & Kobe version of CoD. Never ready for them to hang it up. Much love always Scump. Thanks for making a huge impact on my childhood, especially my teenage years. You’ll be missed but never forgotten. Hope you end this last year on top. 🫶
Couldn’t help but shed a tear at the memories! Ggs brother 🎯💪🏽 #onelastdance #scumpy
Thank you for Making my childhood amazing.
rip
Wow can't believe it, what a legend!
Mans about to blow up on twitch
Enjoy married life scump
Been watching you since the start of your career and will be here for the end. Good luck and can't wait for the streams
The GREATEST OF ALL TIME!!!! #OpTicForever #T2P #GreenWall
Say it's not so #longlivetheking
This gave me goosebumps
Scump played the new COD and was like "Yeah I'm out." haha  The GOAT in my books. Nobody's been at the top of their game for this long in COD. Won't be the same without you, and God willing, you retiring will be the end of competitive COD or at least the CDL. Bring it home one last time.
Love you scumpii<3
Legend!
I just threw up 😔😔😔
Omg the chills I got after you said that ❤ legend
That sucks scump is my favorite cod pro
Scump, you will always and forever be a legend to us, your legacy will never be forgotten, thank you for everything
THE FUCKIN GOAT 🐐
Legit sent chills down my body, sad sad era coming to and end we love you KING❤
Dude time flies.. Ive been watching you crush it for years! Have truly enjoyed the ride.. The level of gameplay you've brought day in and out has been nothing but a pure joy to watch.. I hope this season is the best yet, because you truly deserve nothing less than to go out like the King you've always been!! 💚💚💚 Let's Go Optic!! 💚💚💚

The goat
the absolute greatest to ever do it. made me fall in love with competitive cod as well as cod in general. thank you scump.
Watched you since I was like 11 I'm 22 now, I remember the black ops 2 and MW3 pubstomping
GOAT
I can’t anymore man 🥺🥺😭😭 everything good in my life start to end…..
Been watching competitive COD since I was 13.. I'm 24 now.   Thanks for everything, Seth!!  King
LFG SETH 💚
The greatest player I’ve ever had the liberty of watching compete. Thank you for years of excitement! ALL HAIL THE KING👑
I’m a hard 24 year old man and I’m tearin up right now. All of you don’t know what this man has done for me. He helped through the death of several friends and members of my family. I will never forget the day my grandpa passed and Seth Scump Abnehmen helped my through the thoughest part of my life. I love you, my Family loves you and God is proud of you. GG ole pal
Sethy Seth Respect!
Games so bad he didn’t even have to scrim before deciding. Thanks IW you fucking trash cans :(
I'm not crying! Your crying! #scumpforpresident
Holy shit man. You were the one that brought me in to competitive CoD back in 2011. I’ve followed you ever since, to me you are OpTic as much as anyone. There will never be a player who has had the impact you have had on me, and the scene. I may not play much CoD anymore, but I’ll be watching this year with intent. Get it King, love ya 👊
Scump you released this video the same day my son was born today ❤️ love you brother!
Nah this can't be real, I've grown up with this legend, such an inspiration, an example of commitment and tenacity and just such a great human being. You really are the king and everyone who loves cod owes so much to you. Uhhhh theya
My sister just got into cod (Cold War) and I was just telling her about scump and crimsix… told her about the memories, how much of a beast they were and mentioned to her one retired and one is soon to be retired and the moment has come 😢😭 glad I got to see u win a championship my GOAT Greenwall forever ♾ 💚😢
the goat
When they ask; where were you, when the universe ended
You have given me so much joy in my life thank you boss man. Will follow and support you through whatever moving forwards after this year ❤
Youve been my childhood hero, growing up admiring you scumpii, you impacted my life in ways you cant even imagine you’re the best, the king will always live on ❤️
Man you’ve been my childhood ever since i was 11 and now being 22 it’s gonna be a hell of a last ride thank you for everything
Dude the feels on this. Thanks Scump for everything you've done and everything you have taught us about the Game.
WOW MAN im a grown man sobbing right now watching this video, it all started from watching urs and proofys content got me into this scene and emotionally invested from the jump. Not knowing who optic was to being a die hard fan over the years. crazy you made me loyal to the green wall through thick and thin. You are my michael jordan man. To see what you have done to build call of duty to where its at now is amazing. i know you will never see this man but i love you. the impact you have had on me is insane. you will never know me or see this unfortunately but thank you king i dont think ill ever watch call of duty as invested as i have since mw3
Am hart broken I have been saying one more year for the last 4 years I guess this is the last on cdl hope to see you on YouTube with Dr disrespect and swagg and fam it be dope
All respect goes to him. The king himself!! The one guy who can talk shit and back it all up with a sub or AR lol. Been one hell of a ride SCUMP.
This is the beginning of the end for COD as we know it.
Damn. History bro. Glad i was able to see it from the start.
Absolute chills.
Great video! Good luck this year and the future.
Well deserved …
Thanks for the memory’s king
Is it because Activision is kicking/buying you out? To replace you with the Nadia type?
Love him more than life he helped me through my best and understanding times growing up much love to my goat he’ll do the best with his charisma he’s always had ❤️
🐐
Time to go out on top 💪
Congrats in your marriage Scump! Legend always! Much love! 🔸🥷
The like ratio shows how much you mean to us Scump, Greenwall forever 💚
I watched the bo2 days live, it's been a fun ride scump.
The reason I love cod
so fireeeee man loved watching you man
I just cried
GOAT💚💚
Been watching you dominate lobbies and tournaments since black ops 1. Every thing we do in life thier is always someone who so good no one else come close and for call of duty it was you.  Smash this last year.
Man that hits a different spot..especially when Scump sat in the chair at his spot in the “OG” optic house. This man has been the face of Optic for so long, it’ll be sad to see you go King Scump but your retirement is well deserved 👑.
This took me back to the good old days🥲
Mann after watching the movie bohemian rhapsody which has a happy-bitter sweet ending and than looking at YT to see this mannn the world trying to make me cry today lol doesn’t help that I’m sick
Damm been watching since the beginning strange to see this best to you
I remembered watching this man and NadeShot go crazy on CoD ghost all the time after school, can’t believe this crazy ride is comin to an end 🔥🤙
NO SCUMP WTF, since i was 14! Im 23!!!
Damn scump is a legend in my books one of main reasons I’m a sweat at games an not In prison
Bro what’s this @scump😢
Cinematic masterpiece. The greatest MLG player.
:(
Atheya, shit literally almost had me in tears
From appearing in a R0naldinho1224 video, to now being considered, without a doubt, the GOAT of Call of Duty. Man, how time flys by. We all remember when you came into the scene, every single player was compared to you. The gameplay/skill got our attention, the personality kept us hooked. The entertainment brought was top notch. This is definitely one of those “going to miss it when it’s gone” moments. I’m 29 and I quit playing COD around Call of Duty Ghosts. But I still came back to watch and support your vids, and I guarantee there plenty more like me.   Long live the King of COD🫡
One of the greatest players to ever touch COD
This video hit different. Been a subscriber for a large portion of my childhood and adult life so far. Your community will back you whatever you decide to go forward with after competing - I just hope we get the content creator scump back! 😁
Wow! 2012 BO2 League Play, Until now. THANK YOU, I think we can all agree That Scump has made a legacy for us to Watch from Past and Present. What he leaves behind is Extraordinary and Should earn the highest of praises. Once again Thank YOU King 👑 Scumpy
Absolute Lengend 🐐 Brought tears to my eyes 🥲 thank you for all the good memories CHAMP! 👑
My last memory of my childhood is officially ending
Good luck have fun bro 💚
Well damn that hit hard
Gave me chills, we appreciate you Scump. I can say for myself you were a big part if my childhood. Now go reap the benefits of your work. A Legend.
Wow… Scumpy man :(
LEGEND!!! 🤴🏻
Noooo!😭
Thanks scump for getting me into call of duty back in the OG MW2 days. I know it must be tough not recognizing the game you fell in love with and I wish you nothing but the best on your next journey.   This isn’t goodbye, but cya later old friend(Spike’s voice from Cowboy Bebop)
This gave me chills
I JUST TURNED 20 MY FRIENDS AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE MAN WHEN WE WERE KIDS THANKS FOR EVERYTHING GOAT
I grew up watching scump and I turn 34 next week. Guys a legend but I get it trust me cod is not the same and we get older and move on to better things.
Bruh ain’t no way. I been looking up to this man ever since black ops 2. Man was my hero. I wanted to get so damn good at these games just so I could play him. Can’t believe this is actually happening. Will for ever always say “call me optic scumpy” whenever I shit on any kids in any game. Thank you for all the great memories and all the great plays. Truly the greatest call of duty player there ever was and ever will be.
The greatest to ever do it
my childhood was literally watching u on yt miss u king youll alwayss be as GOAT
The goat is green today💚
Why am I crying??? You've worked so hard and if stepping back is what's best for you then I wish you the best of luck in the next chapter of your life. Just know you are and always will be one of the greats.  With love from Ireland 💚
Trying not to cry at work now😣 #Neverforget
who else teared up a bit seeing this. Been watching scump my whole life
My hair literally stood up.. going to be sad to see you leave after growing up watching you throughout these years. Good luck this year Seth. See you on the other side!
You literally made competitive cod what it is today you will forever be a legend
No way men 💔
Respect and all the best with your future
damn
I dont blame him, cod has gone really down hill especially with mw2 and I wouldnt find joy in competing in such a title
Just gave me chills. I’m Honored to have been able to watch your goated career.
Dont leave bro
I’ve only ever felt this way once when my favorite basketball player retired I’m watching the last respawn of the ginga ninja
I hope this is a Tom Brady retirement
Thanks for the ride Seth, you're a true King💚
Guess cod is getting to hard for you huh
The GOAT, you single handedly change the gaming world forever, and I'm forever grateful I got to watch you through out my childhood. Much love brother and best of luck in the future <3
no way you're ending on this game 😪
thanks for the memories seth, watched you play as a teenager, and now i’m a grown man. i wish you ever success in your next adventure. best of luck for the new season my friend
Lmao played one day of this game and he’s done
This gave me the chills.... been here since leverage man I'll never forget you brotha 🙏 best of wishes to all your future endeavors ❤️
We're getting old boys. So many games, so many hashtags and so many memories. Thanks Seth, its been a pleasure.
childhood really is over
Fuck man, SCUMPI THE GOAT
Scumper jumper scumpy the king the legend let’s get this champs ring and ride off into the sunset baby
Best player in call of duty history man your the reason I play games ive been watching you since i couldn't hold a controller dude retired or not stays a goat Scumpieee👑
wow
Absolute Legend💯💯you made my days with your bo2 videos
Noooo
stop bro, Ive never watched scump once but this shit has me tearing up right now 😭
Give it all you got Seth, do not leave a thing in the tank, for you may regret it!!! We got your back, we’ll always be here for you so c,mon! C’MON!!!!!! ONE. LAST. DANCE. BABY!
Dude. You will be missed. I’ve been rewatching all of your BO2 videos and your “70” series for the past year now. It’s kinda got the same ‘addiction’ feeling as watching Conan’s Jordan Schlansky videos or David Blaine’s videos… can’t watch just one. You’ve made such a major impact on the Call of Duty community, and I hope you know that we are ALL rooting for you. You’ll probably still be hopping on to pub stomp, so this isn’t a goodbye I presume, just a “theeya” later.
Y’all kissing this guys ass tooo much
😭😭😭
The KING about to be the GOAT!
Always been a dream of mine to play against seth, guess I gotta give it my all again this year.
I remember watching you and nade play bo2 with my cousins whenever I was like 13 bro. This gave me goosebumps. What a legend.
❤
Fucking chills…
I cried to this for 15 min straight
Unreal. It’s never gonna be the same without you Scump! Cherish this last ride as much as you can brother!
Thanks man you changed a lot of kids childhoods
Wow 😢
You were my entire reason to keep playing call of duty for so long. We all grow out of it eventually and we all knew this day would come eventually. It’s amazing what you have accomplished. Wishing the best for you in all your endeavors. 1650 forever ❤
Scump played this new COD and said "Alright Bitches, Im out!"
We love you scump.
THE Micheal Jordan of competitive COD, well said scump!
Literally a legend in the cod community. 😢
Goattttt🐐🐐
Ed sheeran
Let’s Go Optic, one more championship for Scump!
I actually cried dude I will never forget coming home to watch your bo2 vids and I’ve been watching ever since you’re a legend and your legacy will live on forever in cod
Shed a tear watching this. Love you my man Scump, excited to see where full time streaming takes you next year🤍
Man. To think I grew up the same age, not far from you. You made me feel as though it was possible to be great at a young age! Thank you for being an inspiration, an icon and lastly thank you for making competitive gaming what it is. We love you brother and can’t wait to see where life takes you from here! Now go get that ring! The best to ever do it right here 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The best cod player to ever touch the sticks, an absolute ride it has been Scump. No, I'm not crying by the way.. you are.
GOAT

Haven’t watched competitive cod in years. But seeing you retire is tough to see. I wish you all the best legend.

THE CALL OF DUTY GOAT SCUMPIIII
I never comment on YouTube videos….. But this deserves a comment. Scump you are the best cod player to ever do it! Thanks for the enjoyment and entertainment you have brought to us all ❤️
OG
Thank you for showing me the passion of competitive cod. I've been following you and OG since the days of big tymer, nadeshot, rambo etc. Without you, I wouldnt have found the huge passion of gaming. Thank you Seth. You will always be the GOAT.
Time to win the trophy this year!!!! GO OUT WITH A BANG SETH
The GOAT of cod is passing his knowledge onto his duo shottzy hopefully he can live up to your greatness King scumpii

We look forward to this season and we'll always remember the legend the king the goat. We appreciate all the dope years of competing and content for us to watch and get better on. Nothing but respect for you King Scump💪🏻
Fukn love you Seth.
Im not crying..
One last ride 💚 comp scene will never be the same
Really hits considering we’re the same age. Watched you right along side you the whole way. Crazy. Knew it would happen eventually and you went on longer than I thought. But I’m not too sad knowing the crazy fun content you’ll know be able to produce. I hope you make a full time comeback to YouTube and make pub vids all the time and whatever else you wanna do. I know I’ll be here for the ride, just like all these years 😊
Perfect way to go bro, lets make it count .   ahhhhhhhhhh see ya!
Te quiero mucho
Holy cow, I knew this day would eventually come but I didn't think it would hit this hard, it was fun following you along this whole journey, good luck scump.
One more round. One more round. This hurts I can’t lie, the final year of watching scump compete in cod, I’ve dreaded this day for so long now. But, I understand, good luck with future endeavours after this year Seth.
Scump. Nadeshot. BigT. Merkz. Forever.
Damn. It’s like Lebron retiring from the NBA 😢 Thanks for the best Cod moments!
Thank you, King Scump. The OGs remember you from BO2 days. It’s been a fun ride watching you grow up along the way.
Youre the only CoD channel/streamer I still follow here and there since like 6 years, although I basically dont even play CoD anymore. Im not even native English. That just shows the impact you had and still have in the CoD community, cause im sure theres a plenty other people who do the same as me. Hope you end it strongly with a chip as you deserve.
This made me emotional. I'll always cherish the moments optic and myself had shared these last 10+ years. Scump is and always will be the goat
Thank you bro.. watch you since I was 15 or 16… I’m 26 now king scump, you deserve your flowers
I remember when I was doing competitive he was dominating the USA scene, during MW3 so the first COD World Championship he was not able to play it because he was not 18 years old, that's crazy how time flies ^^ After 10+ years he's still at the top level doing a competition, proud to have seen all this journey since day 1😳 Legends never die 👑
fuck i almost teared up!
good luck champ 👑🏆👑
Amazing video. Thanks for all the memories #Greenwall #GOAT
Don't
Chills, pure Chills! 💚Lets get it this year!
Who else cried
We’re finally in this era, wow does time fly, I love you bro thank you so much for the memories. ❤️❤️❤️
We salute you Scump! You are and always will be the Cod God!
Preciate you for bein who you were , growin up watchin you on bo2 along wit pamaj y’all kept me playin cod , until next time , god bless you 🪬
Wow bro been apart of my childhood hood. Watched him since i was in the 6th grade and im 23 now 😭 thats tuff bro hope you still create content in the future man
After he leaves I’m probably never gonna watch comp again
Damn bro I started watching you play when you started on optic time goes by quick 😢🫡
The best cinematic goodbye I have ever seen. This was epic. Let the new year of cod begin.
I’m not fucking crying. It’s crazy how this feels like the Titanic sinking and I’m one of the ones that’ll be left behind to die, but also not panicking like everyone else because I accept it. I’m 30 years old. I had amazing times with people I’ve never met irl that are closer to me than my own brother, watched BigT, Nade, Formal, and Crim come and go, and now Scump. This is the end of an era. Call of Duty will officially move forward without a lot of us when Scump retires. I can’t wait to not cry again when the entire arena bows down to the King
I’m not f’n crying leave me alone😢
I’m not going to lie, I never really got SUPER heavy into watching professionals play COD. And it’s mainly because whenever I had free time, I spent all MY time playing competitive COD like on gamebattles since 2009. Scump is the only professional COD player I follow. I’ve known of Scump for years and every so often I would watch his YouTube videos or catch him on twitch sometimes when they were doing COD champs. This is the first vid I’ve seen of Scump in months and even so, reading that title and watching the first minute of the video has my eyes watery because I knew what it was. More so watery because I wish people could spend more than 10-12 years playing at the level they want without having to retire because I’m sure that time flies by. Kudos to you Scump ❤
i remember coming home from 6th grade in middle school and watching your videos at night. such a great time and era for video games. everyone at school would talk about you. i live in pennsylvania and you went to cumberland valley high school which is like 10 minutes away from me. everyone hoped to run into you one day out in public considering how close you were to us. thanks for the best memories of our childhood scumperjumper ❤
Good luck and thank you for all the content and years of it man. It's truly appreciated.
Goat.
It sounds so selfish to think that I am any different than any one else who has watched you for years. It’s so silly that I grew so attached to random guy who for months I probably didn’t even know his real name. BO2 was amazing, but it wouldn’t have been the same without you. I think I “fell in love” with watching you compete. It gave me a friend when I didn’t have one. You were my friend. You don’t know me but god sometimes it felt like you were right there with me. You’ll always be a friend.
I'm a grown ass man that literally just teared up!
Damn, I’ve been watching you since the bo2 days. And this marks a 10 year run of watching you grow into what you are today. 😢
Tears💔
Just know man that you inspired many ppl to play cod you’re a living legend and always will be I wish you a happy retirement and nothing but the best in your future ventures, long live the king!! Greatest slayer to ever play the game
I love you man won’t be the same without the King
I’ve never wanted to cry more
I'm crying
Nothing will be the same.
Literally just cried
Bro you will be so missed! I hate you may never see this, I remember waking up Saturday mornings just to watch you play man, so sad but so bitter sweet! You will be missed Scump
One last dance babe! Make it a good one! Thank you scump for all the years of timeless clutches and memories in Competitive cod! Cannot wait to see you streaming more often though
Damn… forever my 🐐🖤💚
Seth I know u won’t see this but I would like to thank u for all the memories u have given me and all of your fans over these years I also want to thank you for being a inspiration for me you are the reason I fell in love with call of duty and content creation to the point where I am now a streamer and YouTuber thank u and I speak for everyone when we I say we know “WHOSE THE BEST IN THE GAME”
the strongest player in cod history.
crim retiring and now scumpii?! just take me already, god
I didn't grow up watching you, as I was already 20, but I did watch you grow up and go through so many lineups, tourney wins, devastating losses, dramas, personal problems etc.   You did amazing. You've come such a long way and accomplished so much and cemented a legacy that will never be matched. I'll watch your farewell tour with pride. You done us all proud.
Got the chills bruh, good luck man. Your a legend
Long live the King . The legend will never die. #KingScump
The memories of black ops 2 league play 💚
Dang got my in my feels and shit
Epic
Crazy that this is making grown ass men tear up, me included 🥲

Absolutel legend in his own right, a god in the call of duty & online gaming community... An inspiration, sad to see the legend go, but what a ride & thank you for so many memories
End of the greatest era in CoD
1 LAST YEAR 🐐
easy to say, hard to believe 😢
GG scumpy, you will forever  be a legend.
The real goat the man did it on and off the stage like no one else. Scump dawg salute 🫡
Damn what a video🔥
Haven’t been into the competitive seen too much over the past couple years as I am getting older too and have other things going on life. But Scump man you are truly an inspiration to so many people and loved watching you grow as a person this is not the end I know you continue to do great things. You are the man.
All good things need to come to an End CDL gonna be lonely wothout you Scumpy i used the Grip that you used haha.  Now Goodbye
Go 🦅
This man influenced half of my entire life. This is insane. Thanks for the plays. Remain Epic!
Got that OG tat for a reason
Most defining man in cod history
Goosebumps…. Remember playing against you in mw2 and I just knew… that I was better than you (dramatic pause) nah I’m just kidding. ✌️ 🐐
My main motivation in the COD scene! Been watching back since the OG sweat bannin’ days of BO2. Always been a joy watching you play. Will definitely have to see you play on LAN this year. Thanks for everything, much love to the king 👑
my kids will know your name scump. Love you bro so happy for you❤️
Not watching competitive anymore
Man really made me cry
much love bro
Ima kms
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This hit hard… sorry your last season is on this trash MW2 remake 😢 would love to see you in jet packs again.
Beautiful. I am rooting for you. 💚
So happy he’s said one more year at the end, my heart was dropping out my body for a min
One more time😭😭 Let's Get It Boys #GREENWALL
Man I’m sad 😞
Scump, the reason why i started playing call of duty
I’m not crying you are
Damnn rip to competitive cod😢
Scump the goat 🔥🔥🔥
I actually miss him already.
Good for you man! Cods a joke now
💚💚
Been not wanting this day to come for so long! This sucks so bad man! Hopefully you’ll stay in the content world and upload daily or semi-daily again!
🐐
Man took one look at MW22 and thought "well I ain't playing this shit for 2 years" 😂
Damn. I grew up with Scump, Nade, Formal, and Crim. What an era.
The goosebumps bro. Love this mans and he will always be one of my favorite players🖤
Love this type of shit ya know? People like this to us are the real celebrities and half the world don’t even get what we mean by that. We look up to people like Scump, because people like Scump are like you and me. ❤
If this man knew how much he actually means to us, he’s more than just a pro player… he’s literally my idol and has been for the past 10+ years. I imagine this is what it’s like to get hit by a train. Because damn this was hard to find out about
You'll always be the king of COD, The one true GOAT, no one will ever top the legend of Scump
I’m sad. 😢 Thanks for everything Scumpi. One last ride. 👊🏼
Goosebumps. Incredible video.
Been a fan since BO2. You’ve always been my favorite player. This one hurts worse than thinking about Rodgers retiring. THE GOAT, THE KING, OpTiC SCUMPER JUMPER❤️❤️
The king forever no one will take his place the best to ever do it man fr
I was here for this
The King Legend ! Let’s go out with a bang. LETS GO OPTIC !
Holy shit this hurts
Cod is dead
Noooooooo😥😥😥😥😥😥
I’m not crying you are😢
Bro I can’t stop crying bro no
My childhood consisted on me watching you pub stomp and compete man you’re the goat man🥺💯
The Goat of Cod 🐐                I dont give a fuck what anyone says
Took less than 24 hours of mw2 for scump to call it quits 😮‍💨
I’m drunk and this shit hit me hard man….
What a video what a career. No one’s done it like you. I definitely teared up alil 😢
Thank you Scump ❤
Broooo this video is nostalgic asf man I remember I couldn’t wait to get home to watch him pub stomp noobs 😂😂 and All I can think about is him sweatbannin 88-0 I think man good times 🥲
🖤🖤🎃
I'm not crying you're crying 😢
Winning it all this year. We love you Sethy
GG Scump
Such a good video wow I can’t believe it I literally grew up watching scump now I have my own kid. This hit hard but you deserve everything after you’re done competing 💜
Wow reliving those moments this was a dope retirement video
Almost cried….. 😢
Man this feel like a big part of my childhood chapter is closing, love you scumperjumper
It's been a pleasure to watch you compete for all of these years.  Here's to hoping for great things in your future.
3 goats in one last year.... brady,lebron,scump
Mannn!
No pls
👑+🐐
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This video is set up and shot so well. It's been such a wild ride man, Nadeshot got me into the scene. Now i dont really keep up or watch pro cod anymore but you were definitely the biggest reason that i stayed around as an Optic fan for so long. Thanks for all the great memories, hopefully you can win that championship one last time.   Altho this is the end of your pro chapter I see you being a super successful twitch streamer if you keep at it (not that you already arent) but now you can grow even bigger since you no longer have to grind CoD for 8+ hrs a day and can play other games
Sweatbannin for life
Man this is tough to see but all good things come to an end. The 🐐
I literally cried
If this don’t make you feel old 90’s babies, idk what will??? Thank you for the ride Seth we are forever indebted to you!!🙏🏼
Literally brings me back to my childhood every time I watch you scump. You’re literally a COD legend💚
This video not only showed us scumps journey it also embodies our journey over the years through online FPS gaming. Respect to Scump.
King of COD
I feel old
The GOAT.
😢
Wow….. just wow! The memories came flooding in
Damn formal retired and now scump retiring, sad years of cod lately. It’s never gonna be the same. #T2P for life

I can’t be the only one that shed a few tears… lol
praying this is a tom brady typa retirement
Hope he gets another ring. than goes to halo and wins another 1 😂
Watched you play ghosts and advanced warfare when I was 8/9 years old, thanks for your time Scump.
Been a fan since the mw3 and bo2 days, good for you for killing the game King Scumpi!!! Best of luck moving forwards.
In my opinion, the greatest Sub player of all time. Thank you for all the memories, I wish I could go back to BO2 when everything was simple and watch my boy. Thank you so much for everything. 💚🤍🖤
You’re one of the biggest reasons i got into cod, and wanted to get good at it. Thanks for all you have done for the game 🤘🏽
We are watching history
legends never die u will be missed scump
And the countdown till COD really dies has just begun..
I've not only watched Scump grow as a player, but as a person. Almost feels like growing up together. I've been following Hecz and Scump since the beginning. Looking forward to watching the absolute fuck out of your creator content. Best of luck in the upcoming season. #6050 #Greenwall
Get him out of hereee
It's my birthday today...don't know what to say after seeing this....happy and sad at the same time..i guess every great things comes to an end eventually...will cheer LETS GO OPTIC every faking tournament
LONG LIVE THE KING
Mannn, this whole video gave me goosebumps. I been watching Seth since I was in elementary school during them 360 days to now he's doing his last year in competitive cod. He will always be a legend to us OG cod players 💯 thanks for all the good times during my childhood Seth. You got me through a lot and made me want to play cod in the first place, Go champ finish with a banger !!
So glad I had guys like you and nade to look up to. It’s gonna be an emotional rollercoaster when you retire👑💚
Oof this hurt
Feels like "His name was Vegeta, a proud.... saiyan.... prince". As a 34 year old father of 2, I was not ready for this.
NO POR FAVOR NO 😭😭
That's the way to do it. Go out on top. You're still better than all the other streamers even while most of them are using hacks.
Man I’m retiring too, this game is dog lol
Actually got me tearing up
Feel like the day was never going to come, you’ve been around so long and I got to witness it all unfold. A blessing to the gaming community, praying you guys win a championship this year but regardless, you are the 👑
Seth, honestly man you're probably never gonna see this but man.. You have  been the biggest inspiration to thousands of people since day one. I've been around for a while now and I have to say I have always loved watching you compete, broke my heart every time I saw you lose. You will always be THE legend of this scene. Love you scump, go get yourself that second ring ❤️
Well I hope it's the best fucking dance of your life, King. #BrickbymotherfuckingBrick
Hope you’re last year wil be your best year 😢❤
LETS GO BABY!
Halo 2 💙 my baby
the Michael Jordan of cod 🐐 great video thanks for everything Seth
Fuck I’m sad
A legend of my childhood fr
Man you were my childhood. This hit me right in the feels ❤️
Fuck this is depressing as hell i used to watch all of scumps vids in middle through high school it wont ever be forgotten when i think of cod comp i think of scump ❤❤
I never usually comment, but thanks Scump for making me fall in love with COD
Absolutely heartbreaking I knew when the day will but nothing could prepare me for it 💚💔
Been greenwall since I 1st heard of it on cod4 with sniping, your impact to gaming and Cod are without a doubt the greatest!!
🐐 ❤
The King the GOAT. Let's go out with a bang this year!!!
My day just got even more sad. 😔
You inspired me so much through my life and childhood the goat of the cod champs
The goat the king 👑
You the best
One of the greatest players of all time without a doubt I remember getting clapped by you in scrims on Advanced warfare and ranked play on Bo2
i almost teared up.
BEST EVER
BEST cod player ever!!! I’ve followed him for over 10 plus years and he’s truly made an impact on my life, it sucks to see him go but he will go down as the KING OF COD😢🤙🏻
Such a good vid man hope whatever is next for you is what makes you happy. Good luck on the season hope you can go out with the ring!
Forever a legend on the sticks Seth from a fellow ginger to another its been great watching your journey through the years man. Let's have a banger of season! Green Wall strong!!
long live the king
Forever the King
that was such a well made video im stunned.
The fucking goat 😭
the reason i found out what competitive cod is
that was some emotional shit
Watched you since I was 12 I turn 24 in January, lit my childhood bro this nearly made me cry😂
You are a Legend, COD won’t be the same without you, I’m glad I was able to see you play all these years, a true icon. Much love.
wow… loss for words. i remember growing up watching this man gets nukes on bo2 when i was 12 and just watching competitive, optic was the only team i really knew back then. crazy to think this is the end :’(. im 22 now glad see all he’s accomplished in the competitive scene and outside of it. best of luck this year scumpy!
Been watching comp cod since the start of Bo2 and I’ve watched almost every event since then. Insane to believe it’s been that long and I’ve enjoyed watching your journey to the top Seth. Best of luck to what you do after this season GOAT
❤❤❤
Saddest news I've got all day! Bring home the gold for the last ride long live the king! 👑 forever the goat.
Every year he retires
The goat
GOAT
What a career @scumpabner ! Grew up watching you/optic for 10 years. ur the reason why I fell in love with call of duty in the first place ! Ur the reason why I still play today and play so competitively regardless of the game I’m playing. Remember back in 2012 when I was 12 years old , used to binge watch all those comp videos & tourneys. Thank Scump for the inspiration to many peeps and will be cheering for ur last year  ! #greenwallforlife #imnotcryingyourecrying
Holy effing tears. End of an era. Been watching your videos since black ops 2. And been following ur competitive career since ghosts. You’re a legend.
Got me tearing up at work 😭 just like others I really got cracked at duty from just watching you and feel like we grew up together honestly. THIS IS YOUR YEAR SCUMP! 🤴🟩
use code SCUMP lmaooo GG's brother
I feel like when they win that ring and championship he might do another year!!?? Or maybe I'm just hoping he will stay and go another. To end all doubt that he's the GOAT. I have him in my #1 spot. This video hurts. Sad. But what a career. Its been a honor to watch you grow up as I did. We're same age and I feel like I know you as my best friend an yet we've never really met an you have no idea who i am. 💚💚💚💚 Goodluck scumpii ur the best.
GOOSEBUMPS! HOLY SHIT
One last dance 💚🐐👑
End of an era 😢 spent the best part of my teen years watching this guy, I hope for the best for what you do next after cod ❤️
I wonder what people will say about him in 2079, 2357, 5000, will their names in gaming ever be forgotten? scump, grizz, rain, yoteslaya, they truly shaped the community, may the community never forget them and many others
Bro this got me emotional!! Been a fan of Scump since 2013 and can’t wait to see his best year be his last!! Let’s go baby!
It was hell of a ride scump thanks for making my childhood fun💚
This is how it’s gonna feel when Bron retires. Thank you for making CoD what it is today 🐐
thank you for everything scump😢
💔
I know this wasn't easy for him to make either.....I can't even watch this without tears, Hearing the clips of certain videos in the background with the music aswell just brings back the memories and gets ya on the feels
Guess we’re just gonna have to enjoy this year even more now. Won’t be the same watching competitive without you.
Long live the king Respect brother 🙏 💯

Man this made me feel a whole lot of feelings I can’t explain.
People gotta understand that the whole golden era is gone and let’s be honest along with it goes the og community. A real shame that we all knew would one day come around. Those memories will live with us all forever, Seth.
can’t believe it, one last ride for it all💚
been watching you for a majority of my life and you’re a legend in the scene man. hoping this last dance is a good one.
The Goat ... some of my best memories are from watching you compete and to see it come to an end feels surreal... no one will ever come close 💚💚💚

Poetic that it's MWII unfortunately the games chalked so you should've retired last szn
ive been watching scump compete since advanced warfare, crazy 😢
why though? you're still nasty and as a flex you would be dominant with like pred and shotzzy next year.
Please don't give up streaming
“And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.” (Marianne Williamson). Thanks for inspiring an entire community of people.
Thanks for the years and memories king scumpy

End of a era 💚

One last ride ey!!!!!
Never heard of that guy but youtube thinks that now would be the right time to suggest him to me lol.
👑
Very sad
I remember the first time I started watching you and found out we had the same name.......you instantly became my favorite player. Shortly after was when i found the green wall!!!! Growing up in 5th-12th grade i always remember coming home from school instantly starting up the 360 to start playing and watching your latest vids, I truly don't think you'll ever understand the impact you've had everyone in the CoD community. Give everything you have this last season, thanks for the tear jerker
SCUMPY the first day of release was that bad you told Hecz shit dawg I cannot go two years of this lol...... JK brotha. The Goat 🐐 from the greatest era of gaming thanks for all the memories looking forward to the last dance brick by brick with the green wall. Congrats nothing but love T2P all the way to the ship!!!
Truly the end of an era of the greatest COD player ever.
😢😢😢
Let’s run it one last time!! I will see you in the season!
im crying in tears the best cod player in history is retiring ill miss you your the reason i still play cod to this day
thank u seth for everything
TOM BRADY, MICHAEL JORDAN, KOBE, LEBRON, SCUMP I SAID IT, GOATS

Have always loved your positive mental attitude. Loved your videos, your commentary and first watched you on the legendary blops2. Never been into esports and pro gaming but all the best for the future.
Dude this almost made me cry wtf
Tears.
mw22 made sculpt quit 😂😂😂😂😂
Legend go out with a bang bro
Yo yo yo 😢
Please god don’t retire, it’ll be a end of a era
So sad ❤
All the best scump! Been following you since the tail end of MW3 my guy. It’s been a pleasure to watch him compete all these years and I hope the squad can bring home one last chip for the 🐐!
Stopped playing cod after bo3. Never stopped following your journey. If I think cod goat I think of you Seth. The pro performances and the content creation were always sublime. I truly believe the cod scene wouldn’t be the same without your career progression.
We all know how the GOAT is. There will never be another Scump.
Thank you for everything 💚
Thank you, King 👑💚
🐐🟢
Say sike rn
🥲
My childhood icon. Absolute legend, You will be missed dearly
Im suprised he stayed for warzone. I loved the memories..  2020 was the last for me, personally. scumpy purge
Forever a Legend, thnk you Scump 🙏🏽
Absolute chills one last ride scump 💚🖤
You better fucking win. I'm not crying I swear.
Made me tear up 💚 because of u i always say “uhh-thee Ya!” When i say bye lol. T2P for life!!!
All I have to say is thank you. 💚
i hope you get the chance to go out on top. even if you don't i have watched you play this series ever since i can remember and imo you are the undisputable GOAT from the way you carry yourself to the nasty plays time and time again. although ill still watch and support the optic cod team it just wont be the same. much respect and good luck on your next chapter KING SCUMP!!!
I knew it was coming but nothing can prepare for this  smh this is tough
This man carried me through high school. Wouldn’t be who I am today without you Seth. This is definitely a tough pill to swallow, but all good things must come to an end. One last ride for the Ginja Ninja! Thanks for the awesome memories, I’m sure there will be more to come… just not in CDL. Love u dawg 🤙🏻
Man that copy of Halo 2 hit different
Teared up out of nowhere what the heck
Damn man. Gonna fucking miss you dude! Been watching you for a decade now it’s sad to see you go 😞.
Damn, all my favs are gonna be gone, I don’t blame ya, cod keeps getting worse and worse each year. This new one is unplayable in pubs, just horrible. Hope ya have a great year, I would love to see you, crim and karma play 1 last tourney ❤️👊
fucking chills!!   legend!
The fact I grew up watching you, you being my idol. I have seen OpTic and you transform over the years and this just hit different seeing a piece of my childhood go away. I remember being able to come home from school and be at peace watching yalls video to use them as a way to escape everything going on around me. In those moments I was truly at peace, shut out the yelling of my parents fighting, helped through depression, made me want to better myself and its all because of yall. So all I have to say is Thank you.
It’s so sad where time has gone fml
Him and lucid look alike.
Damn what a ride it has been! Its been an honor to watch and cheer for you all these years. Thank you for some of the hypest moments in COD.  #LongLiveTheKing #OneLastRide
Literally been watching scumpy since way back and man almost shed a tear watching this cause of the memories and nostalgia. Thanks for making some of the past years of mine so memorable bro!
Goosebumps. Thank You Seth!

Lets go legend , pop off one more year!
You are the reason why I follow OpTic, you are the reason why I've followed CoD eSports for over 10 years, and you are the reason why so many of us love eSports. You'll always be the GOAT. 🐐
Thank you, Scump. Your BO2 commentaries brought me so much joy (Sweatbannin’ - 82-0 especially). I was actually laying down when I saw the video but I sat up when I realised what’s going on. I wish you all the best!
After this year do you still continue making content?? Who will be king when you're done??
😢
I literally like the video before it even started
My gratitude 🙏  and thanks for all those years I grow up with you 🙏

need an optic future bet nd scump for mvp
It’s gonna be hard to watch without you man ❤
I’m not crying you are🥹
Soooo optic is winning champs you heard it here
Scump I’ve been going back watching old videos and seeing your talent grow over the years. The 1 million sub montage is a banger of a video as well as any of your most recents. I’m not going to say you’ll be missed, cause you are still alive and kicking and I can’t wait to see what you have in store for content in years to come. I can’t even think Call of Duty without thinking of Optic Scumper Jumper. Always respected the game, the players, and stayed humble the whole way through. Much love and respect for you scump. Take the trophy next year 🏆
shit made me cry ngl
So that's it he's retiring January???
Long live the King! You gotta tip it bro 💯
🥲🥲🥲
You are the man! "Ah see ya"
If this is the last season video I dread the final goodbye video ima be in tears! But does that mean we get consistent scump vibes on twitch again? We haven’t had that in a few years 🙌🙌🙌 who knew that little ginger bastard would become god to us! 😂
Hits home when I seen this, thank you for all the memories Seth. It’s been a pleasure supporting you, on to the next chapter 💚
A true COD legend. The King.
I'm wishing you the best year of your already great career. I am following your path for quite some time now, BO2 exactly and you, Nadeshot and HecZ are the reason I am loving watching everything around Optic Call of Duty! Thank you so much for so many great years and let's enjoy this last big ride! Greetings from Germany!
RIP cdl viewership
Scump.. you’re a legend and you live in so many of our memories you have no idea. Well done on all your success and from myself but I speak for us all.. thank you. Thank you for everything. <3
Thank you Scump
He can genuinely look back at his career and say I am the best ❤

Halo 2? It's the goat!

Think this is the end of watching competitive cod now :(
Scumpi I graduated the same year as you 2013. I graduated raised a family had multiple jobs. And during that time you were at the top of competitive call of duty for multiple multiple titles. I was here from the very beginning bud. You will always be the 🐐. It may be coming to an end like everything does. But god damn did you put your stamp on it
What a fucking video. Its a chip year for sure.
This is what it felt like when MJ was retiring from basketball 🥹 One Last Ride Scump 💚
Thanks scump, thru my childhood i been watching your vids.I remember techno black ops 2 scump.Forever the Cod Goat
love you scump such a big fan been a fan of you since the mw2 days <33
You have no idea how much this makes me happy knowing you’ll be able to do what you want as you deserve but also hurts so much. So much love man, I hope you kill it this year and end on a high note! I’ll be cheering the whole way man!!
Haven’t played call of duty in the last few years so no idea why this has popped up in my recommended, but damn scumps all grown up! Used to watch your videos back in the bo3 era the last cod I actually enjoyed with bo4 being the last one I ever played, but even after all this time this is still sad to see, but it’s also good to see you move on, get out and live your life I expect by now you’ve probably made far more then enough to retire on anyway, or to invest into education and Persue other careers that you may enjoy
win it all brodie, sweat bannin🫡
end of a long and amazing career. congrats of everything scump. ONE LAST RIDE
You have me at work crying scump

F for a legendary respect
No one can ever talk about the CoD scene without talking about Scump, man will live forever as one of if not the best player to touch the game in my opinion. Shame to see you stop but will always love watching
Seth you were the reason I even got into gaming competitively. The scene is going to miss you and your legacy will never be forgotten. I was in highschool when I saw you. We're close in the same age. Time goes by so fast. Gonna miss you man!
Time to go out on a high 🎉
Man singlehandedly inspired a whole generation
Legend
Super sad 😔
Scump please play the full 2 years of MW2. We love you and respect your decisions. Making grown men cry!!
Forever the king of COD 👑👑
I’m glad I could at least watch you live your dream while I was too soft to do so. You should be proud og. You’re made a lot of peoples lives easier outside of the virtual world us gamers live in. Forever one of the greatest. Stay humble brother
Forever A Legend !

:(
🙏🏽👑🐐
that just gave me chills
After these last 3 games and MW2022 looking like the same as before I don’t blame him for retiring, the game just isn’t fun anymore lmao
Broke a lot of 9 year olds hearts today
You have no idea how much u have impressed on all our lives. Literally grew up w u, u inspired me and so many others. Love u Scump ❤ all good things, must come to end. Cheers.
ouch thanks a lot cod
let's give them hell
The Goat of competitive Cod
You can see the aderall in his eyes🙃
I’m heading to work right now and saw “This is Goodbye…” I knew what this what about, tears started just rolling. I need you to understand how much you actually did for me. I would have never found out about any of the great world of esports without you. All I knew competitively was soccer for years, it was like I was in a trance. I would play games casually but not often, I played call of duty ghosts on my Wii U Gamepad lol but one day in 2015 changed my world forever. I hopped on YouTube and saw you getting a nuclear on bo3 with the VMP, I was hooked. Then I started finding all the esports moments, seeing you destroy EVERYONE on a game I played on gamepad, I was shocked but most of all, I fell in love with esports and from that day, you broke my trance and I could actually enjoy something else competitively besides a sport. I support everything about your decision, I just wanted you to know how much of an impacted you made to all your fans.
I'll never forget that 1v3 snd clutch back on bo2 on aftermath. My favorite cod pro of all time, legend.
All well come to an end. Thank you Seth for all the good memories and for making my childhood the greatest. You will be missed.
“LOOK AT THE FUCKING SCOREBOARD, WHOS THE BEST IN THE GAME BABY” lives rent free in my head.
Reminds me of the days of him and Nade shot... Such wonderful memories
Time to finally become a man.
One last ride!❤️❤️
He is goated. Only reason I watch cod.
Well my heart sank thinking I wasn’t getting just one last year of the king
Why did this actually make me tear up, holy shit.
Never really watched the competitive cod scene but this dudes name was always mentioned when talking about some of the best to ever play the game. Can’t imagine what a lot of y’all are feeling who grew up watching up and now knowing it’s the last ride. The past few years I regularly started watching Optic content and Scump always made me laugh and brought life to the room. Gonna try my best to keep up with this upcoming cod season. Good luck Scump and go out on top!!
COD HAS SUCKED SO BAD FOR SOOO MANY YEARS ITS MAKING THE GOAT RETIRE
All that cheesy BS….for a retirement announcement! Who seriously actually cares eh? And if you do care, why??  Pure example of American cringe 😬…..dude extremely embarrassing!😮
I literally don’t know if I can watch cod with the same excitement I do when Scump is gone… let’s make this year great it’s gonna be sad to see you go..
Undisputed Goat. A Legend.
Thank you Scump
I only started watching scump in AW but man this makes me so sad I’m happy I got to watch him growing up so many memories I’m a LAT fan but I want scump to take it all the way this year he deserves it
😭😢scumpyyyyy
You’re the goat Seth. Thank you my guy! ❤
I just quit my job five minutes before you posted this.
❤❤❤
This is a weird feeling, but I’m excited for you Scump!  I started playing Cod on BO2, and the first YouTube vid I ever watched was the sweatbannin video on raid, from the first X-games to cross map kills with the scorpion, to Mathius you sexy man, you’ve been part of my entertainment for a long time. I know you’re still going to be in the scene but this is a crazy moment.  I wish you all the best, a happy wedding, all the chips this year and a nice long vacation at the end. You’re the Goat Scump! 🔥🔥🔥
This video about made me throw up
The king... Our king of Cod LETS GO SETH!!!
😢 man this one hurts. I get it Seth but dang it’s going really suck to see you leave. COD will never be the same without you.  From the bottom of my heart I wish you best.  I will be watching every game every posted scrim.  Let’s go Seth and let’s make this year a year know no will ever forget. Let’s go green wall.
Wow. My childhood has officially ended
Goodbye ✌🏻

Wow, What a production. What a player and what a king !!!!!  LETS GO OPTIC!!!!!!!!!
As long as Zlefter doesn't replace you my man.. lol
Legend
Dude I was just about to watch a video of yours. Whatttt……  Edit: I thought this man was bouta leave us as a whole in the community! Almost got me!
Why this makes me tear eye. You are a GOAT Scump.
The best to ever do it ur the reason I started playing competitive and you always provided top tier content. Good luck brotha!!
As they say, "Picture (in this case video) is thousands of words (no audio needed)"
“Your biceps are weak maaaaaaan, even at their peak” never forget
:( dam man. Will never be the same without you. Good luck on your last season
Had to watch the video a handful of times to analyze everything you guys had envisioned. Great couple of seconds where you guys put childhood memories from the sofa to the upgrade in chairs and upgrade in equipment as the "time" went on. Truly great concept making us see Scump on his journey. The throwing the headset was one of my favorite scenes, as well as just hearing nadeshots name in on the monitors. Shows how much you cared for Nade to even mention him in your Goodbye. Thank you
😢😢😢💚💚💚💚💚
Watching Scump in the stands hit different. Thanks for all the great times you've given us, and will continue to give us. You're many people's favorite pro player, but you're just as great to watch on the content side of it too.
Optic isn’t my preferred team but Man you’re iconic
So much pain 😢
Thank you for all the memories I’ve followed you since you first showed up in the scene. It’s funny usually people look up to people that are older than they are but watching you play and the content you made made me a huge fan and I look up to you as competitor. Best of luck to you on your new chapter and thanks again for the memories. I’ll never forget them.
Scumpy will forever be a legend ❤😢
The King👑💚
The King will have the greatest year to end it all
Amazing job with the video. You truly are one of the best to ever pick up a controller not just in cod but across everything. Thank you for being such a large part of my childhood we love you Scump we love you Seth.
Bro im happy you said its youre last year and didn’t end it with a video like this. youre my 4ever nr1 i remeber the bo3 days you tried to get 70 kills in tdm of the 100 or 75 i dont know anymore but you was always the movement king these days youre not in youre prime anymore but no 1 expect you to be these games make you crazy even if you are just a regular gamer but i wish you all the best and make them regret that you still be competing this year😈
The man, the myth, the fucking legend 🐐
GG
I aint even watch you that much but you a staple in cod crazy how the time has passed since the days of black ops 2 and the goated cods brought a tear to my eye
It’s gonna be hard to watch competitive COD without the King 👑 whatever happens this next year I just hope he gets a proper send off because he truly deserves it! When you think of CDL Scumpii will forever be one of the first names people think of the 🐐 #ThankyouSethScumpAbner 💚🤍💚🖤
G.O.A.T.
So you’re basically saying MW2 is dogshit? Which pushed you to retire💯
❤
The last one 😢 🐐👑
Why is he leaving tho
The true King, it has been a true pleasure to watch you dominate all these years, end of an era, wish you all the best in your future, and ill still be tuning into your stream, you are endless
Long live the King end this year with a bang 👍

Love you scump
BEST COD PLAYER OF ALL TIME
That’s why he’s the GOAT! THE GOAT!!!! 😭😭😭
This man was literally the only reason why I played comp back when I used to play cod (mw3,bo2,ghost) he had such a huge influence on the scene swear every person I played with when scump was mentioned everyone knew him he was crazy good back then the good ol memories crazy how time flies
Didn't yiur early carrier start with modern warfare 2 🤔 kinda gone full circle huh.
Be the last year I watch😢😢😢
I didn't cry, you did.
Good for you Seth
i still remember watching the bo2 scumpy… we will miss you really much.. hopefully you will still stream and make yt videos because we cant let you leave us entirely just yet.. Make it a great year Seth. we love you
goosebumps
Your going to do great things Seth. Always a fan.
2012. The year i started watching u and the beginning to an amazing journey. Can't wait for u to crush it this year and enjoy the rest of your journey. Thank you for being such and inspiration to a lot of us. We love you! 💚🐐
Man this is hard
#ThankYouScump #Goat
You’ve made me fall in love with competitive gaming, not just call of duty. You’re irreplaceable and you have given us all everything and more. It’s a sad day but we will never stop following you. Ginger ninja, King, T2P. WHOS THE BEST IN THE GAMEEEEE
I wonder what's making him retire from pro cod?
Un-real but hey no better game than mw2 right
i love you ❤️ thank you very much! Green Wall 💚
And what a game to end on mw2 even I’ve came back for this
“WHOS THE BEST IN THE GAMEEEEEE!!!!!” GG TO THE GREATEST. COD WILL NEVER BE THE SAME
Gutted isn't even the word! What a legacy you have left behind... COD will never be the same without you!  We will all miss you 💔
Only one way for it to end……
GOAT, will always remember your prime COD days
Seth’s videos from 2015-17 really helped me take it one day at a time and get through some tough times. Excited to see how the King closes it out.
I have never commented on a YouTube video. I will take the time to do so now, and just say thank you for everything Scump. And this last ride, this last season of yours means more to us than you will ever know. We grew up with you man, you are apart of us in a way. We will be watching and cheering. Not time for tears yet, just excitement for this last season we will all have the pleasure of experiencing. Let's go Green Wall. Let's go Scump.
I'm speechless towards this sort of news but if I were to say anything it'd be thank you for inspiring me to be the best gamer I can be. You kept getting better and better and it wasn't by quitting. Continue to be great, brother. I'll always be watching.
BO2 days were the best 😢
Man. Definitely sad about this. But way more happy for you, Seth. You’ve earned it bud. 💚🖤
I honestly didn't believe I would see the day scump would retire from competitive cod it feels like just yesterday I was watching your black ops 2 videos when they first released it's been an absolute pleasure to watching your content up until this point I wish you luck scump with what ever you decide to do after your done with competitive cod
First vid i seen was sweatbannin. From bo2, gon miss u scump
Won't be the same. Forever and always The King, you will be missed at least in the pro scene.
So little said but the video spoke volumes. Thanks for all the years scump.
The amount of times I yelled “NO DONT DO IT” lololol
Long live the King 👑
What a ride, man.
One last dance my friend. Let's get it!
Super well made video, best of luck legend
GOAT fr
You will never be between. All hail the king 👑
Bro I'm crying. I'm 28 an optic has made viewers feel like we where there for the whole ride.  This is gonna hot so hard when it's truly over
What was said in the last 2 seconds?
If he were to become a variety game streamer , I feel like his personality would make him blow up 😂 🐐
I'm an OG and I've always respected your skill and energy and enjoyed your career. You will be missed and thanks for the memories like watching you win that solo BR championship for 100k!! 💪🏼🙌🏼👏🏼❤️
My guy got me tearing up at work😢
I was never into call of duty on a competitive level until i started watching scump. For a time, i even tried to play claw style on the controller but failed lol Thank you scump for being an inspiration and so entertaining to watch! And lastly you’ll always be my favorite COD pro player, so goodluck on your journey my man. “T2P” Nation!!!
Nah crazy this shit made me emotional. Reminder of all the great memories in the old cod era... playing league and wagers back then when the dream was to go pro in CoD. Watching you, watching  all of the goats that have now retired(mostly)  Pulling all-nighters, skipping school to play the night after releases..talking shit on the mics.. waiting in line at gamestop for the midnight release... so many things a lot of us were lucky enough to either participate in, or witness. Things that sadly won't ever happen again for the most part. Man it's been a hell of a ride for CoD and the CDL. Best of luck to you moving on Scumpi. Thanks for the memories man ❤️
This dude was who I aspired to be when I started watching competitive around the black ops 2 days for sure the undisputed GOAT
one of the greatest
Scumpi 😢
The Fucking King 🤴 👏 🙌
🫡💯 NO WORDS 🔥😢😄
BLUNT BLOWIN` SETH :D OPTIC! :D
This is like watching Michael jordan retire
Bro... I can't even imagine a pro scene without you... Being the same age as you watching you achieve such monumental things really pushed me to better myself. Nothing but love man. One last dance baby!
im with you
an absolute legend!! made me shed a tear...its been a pleasure watching you compete! looking forward to you dominating on what's next
Rip
Good lord im emotional on my 30!! 😢 i will forever cherish the words that made me fall in love with scump “WHO’S THE BEST IN THE FUCKING GAME”
You were my literal childhood 😢 the reason I started making videos, one last ride
this and mr.beasts video hit hard today
One last dance king!! Thanks for everything all those clutches, reverse sweeps, the wins, Cod champs!!
This one hurt 💔
Scumps last dance ought to be coming to Netflix
The King Of Cod, Farewell 💚
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚 The Green Heart Emoji is Officially My Favorite Emoji Now  😢 One For Every Year I Been Watching My Boy
What?? Who tf cares
It'll be a privilege to watch you compete one more time. All the best Seth!
Man, this one hurt. Watched you grind with Nade, and Big T. To see your entire journey through my phone has been amazing. Cheers goat!
From all of us, who have watched you grow as a gamer and a person, thank you for bringing us along this journey. I have been watching you for such a long time and I am so looking forward to your content career after. Thank you for carrying us on your shoulders!
THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GOAT    THE GGOOOOAAAATTTTT
😢 I guess the king is finally putting down his crown. Seth, I just want to say thank you for your contributions to the franchise, the community, the pro scene, the content scene and most importantly your impact on us your viewers. I’m happy that I got to witness your amazing journey over the last 11 years that I’ve been watching. You were the first cod player to get me to migrate away from sniper content back in the day and brought a new outlook on competitive call of duty. Go win 1 more ring and enjoy your retirement 👑
Chills...
Thank you scump for all the years! You've helped me through so much without the knowledge of it, for that I thank you. Let this next chapter in your life bring you to even greater heights.
Hope you enjoy content creating and playing a lot more games. 🐐 Of cod forever. Happy to see you move onto bigger and better things, your gonna kill it
:(
Bro.
Because of this, I speak for everyone in that we will watch this call of duty season. Let’s show our support over the years through this last year. LETS GO SCUMP
I just fell to my knees at work
I never thought the day would come to soon I know you been in the game awhile but this is just crazy..
Man... 5 seconds after the video ended it hit me real hard. All the memories came back to when I was a kid and used to watch his BO2 videos and play with my friends all the way to now.
cant blame you, if anyone deserves to retire after success it is definitely you.
I actually cried wtf
Been the reason I started cod and will forever play some ranked with the homies forever. Big W
the amount of tears i just shed....
One of the greatest esport player of all time. Literally watching you since my childhood, this video gave me chills !
One last ride! Let’s get it!🔥🔥🔥
please don’t leave us
I remember when I was watching a Gold glove video back in black ops 2, when he got in a lobby with you and he said that you was “the greatest call of duty player in the world” and a watch your videos and got hooked on competitive call of duty. Because of you i got some of the greatest memories of your videos/watching you compete that will be with me until the end of time. This is going to be a great year watching your last rodeo competing and it’s going to be sad watching your last map. Thank you seth for everything you’ve done for call of duty and for me. 👑🐐
🤎🫡
Remains the goat
The shout out to Nadeshot...
Thank you Scump for everything we love you champ 🏆
Nah man this actually hit me hard
I thought he wasn't going to play out the season judging by the title so I was pleasantly surprised at first, then the seeyaaa got me 😭😭
Why is it Tagged warzone? Is he moving to warzone after this year? Makes sense. Dude would make a killing streaming every day.

Hi scump, im a 22yo guy from italy...i've been following your journey since the beginning...i just want to say thank you for inspiring me and millions of players...there will always be only one king 💚🥲😭❤️

Love you Scump!! King of cod and a pillar in all of our childhoods. Now let’s get this last ring to make it a perfect ending!!!
All hail the scump trail!!!

Sorry I'm really sorry but farttt
Scump just started this video and you dare try and leave us man ,some of us have been watching you for half our lives you can’t leave us we love you man I hope you can change your mind about it ❤
Respect bro! You've given us YEARS of enjoyment! One last ride baby let's make it a good one!
The goosebumps I had watching this. From watching as a teen to seeing your last year as an Adult. You got this Scump #GreenWall
I’m not crying, we are
A true legend in this scene ❤️
What the fuck I literally just went on an old scump bo2 videos marathon literally last few days and I haven’t watched scump since bo2 (7-8yrs) then now he drops this video that’s some foreshadowing shit 😳😂😂😂
Wnough to make a grown man cry bro❤❤❤
Shame its on such a diabolical cod game
In 7th grade I’d wake up every morning an hour early before going to school to play bo2 and watch one of scump’s videos. Sometime’s it’s really hard to comprehend just how much time goes by in such a small amount of time. 10 years later and it all still feels like yesterday.
I am getting old. I grew up seeing your advanced warfare and ghost tournaments. 100% the goat in the cdl. I’m glad i get to see your final ride Scump. The King forever
I was having a good day too, not anymore
“I’m the best in the game!”
He is him.
Take care brother and congrats on the engagement💪🏻🤘🏻
My childhood🙏🏻
Hope you leave with another ring man gunna miss seeing you play comp
Right in the feels….
🐐
Love you scumper jumper
You stay the GOAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
There goes my childhood
The Goat
damn :(
Thank you for everything and being someone I looked up to as a kid and still do to this day! U are one of my biggest idols and I love you Seth❤ u are the GOAT
I legit cried😭 this will be my final year watching. Literally only tuned in for this man😢 the dynasty is officially over after this
The impact you’ve had on call of duty and esports as a whole will never be understated. Truly an incredible career that has inspired millions. Let’s make this last year special, Seth.
T2P till I die. Congrats Scump. #Greenwall
YOU KNOW YOULL PLAY TREYARCHS GAME! SAME ENGINE CMON SETHY
I wish you and the comp boys back in the day didn’t leave twitch for MLG TV , the good days would have lasted even longer!
The nostalgia
After years of watching and not watching it kills me to see this but I am also aware everyone needs to grow and thrive in different ways. Seth, from the bottom of my and our hearts you will never be forgotten. I can remember you from year 5-6 when I was going through a very hard time in school, my parents were getting divorced and I was getting racially abused at school. It always made my day seeing you. I am now 21 years old and haven’t watched you in a year or so but damn, this honestly kills me. LOVE YOU
Team OpTic Gaming will always be Together as a team forever as always a Great True Team Legend.
thank you for everything Scumpi! Best regards from the Dominican Republic 🇩🇴
Got chills watching this. One more ride
I’ve never been able to make it out for any cod events, but this COD year I’ll make sure to make it out and hopefully see this man who made mines and many others childhoods full of laughter and great memories, I was sad when Nade called it ,but this one hits much harder 😢. The Green Wall is in full support to see Scumps next chapter and to see him get one more Ring as the 🍒 on top.
Goosebumps
Your literally the reason I started playing cod #LongLiveTheKing
The production is incredible, well done guys! Its been a long road. Seth you've been spectacular through out your whole career and I think I speak on behalf of all of us by saying your the one true 🐐 plain and simple. #onelastride
Can’t believe I’m seeing this today. You’re like my Derek Jeter. Make this year one to remember King Scump 👑
Well… I guess it’s my last year watching cod.
So is Scump the first person to enter the Esports Hall of Fame?!?
Thank you for the great years man 🙏🏻🙏🏻
8 years of scump, Fucking legend man
Long Live Seth 'Scump' Abner ❤️
Unless they win champs and they're undeniably the best then he might wanna come back for another....wishful thinking lmao :((((
An amazing Legacy! I’m going to go out of my way to see you live this year. That way I can say that o saw you before you retired! Thank you for the tears of commitment!
This was chilling brought back so many memories man you were an inspiration to all of us especially to me because you came out of my town so nothing seemed impossible and we’re all so proud of you Seth and you should be more proud of yourself you’ll always be the KING in our eyes stay true #GreenWall
It was good while it lasted. Well wishes on your future endeavors my man. The Black Ops 2 days will be with me for the rest of my life.

Good god man, this one hits.  This video was so amazingly well done. All of that history in just a moment.
Growing up watching call of duty comp, you were my childhood & my inspiration to pub stomp & be the best.  Been watching your videos since I was 12, I'm now 23 & I still look up to you.  A goat in CDL, a legend in gaming & a fearless charismatic leader, we love you Seth ❤️

MW2 really put an end to his career.
Can’t wait for you to pick up this years World Championship trophy! You and Nade were my intro to Competitive COD and I’ve been riding since Black Ops 1! Thank you
Damn, this one hit hard. We'll have to support him and the team to the max, for the king's last year. But What a video, don't know who made it, but it's like i saw my teenage years, my adult ones, chills and tears. Damn we grew up with Scump n Hecz and Nade and Formal and everyone else, i keep repeating myself in the comments, but thanks for the entertainment guys, I wouldn't have it any other way.
GG bro ❤

LEGEND!
Legend.
This better be a lie
Bro fuck man. Shit made me cry
King
end of an era, competitve cod will never be the same without you
Amazing video. Although I haven’t kept up with you Scump in years I remember the days of MW2, Bops1, MW3, BOPS2, Ghosts, & AW. What a ride it’s been. Even though I stopped competing after COD Ghosts (beginning of AW) one day we all stop with the cod grind. What a ride. all Hail Scump!
You filled so many childhoods during  your long career. We're so grateful to witness something truly amazing.
jesus man this one reallly hit me. I seen my whole childhood play out in my head. wow just wow #ONELASTDANCE
Damn... Son has been a pleasure watch you, Nadeshot making gaming history man.
Thank you for everything Scump !
Glad your still competing for one more year man your a legend and will forever be! Godspeed SETHY! ❤️
Been here since day 1 of Xbox consoles I was 17 before that I played everything in-between PC, Atari, PlayStation, handhelds to Xbox.  There weren't any players I couldn't toe 2 toe with back then it's been a pleasure gamer. I'm not nearly as rich with money but just as blessed with gamming moments as you. Love of the game right 😊 GLHF Scump GG's.  From an OLD Gamer x50 the x50calkiller 🖖😎👌 Thanks for the good times.
Between Seth winning World Series of WarZone and Formal getting the Halo Worlds title I couldn’t imagine a better way for these guys to go out on top in the tail end of their careers.   Watching their banter in the Podcasts has been some of the best content out there and I hope they find a way to still be involved after retiring. I’ll be watching.
after the season is over we are going to miss you man u were awesome player and a great human being we gonna miss you Seth keep grinding man #greenwall
Now the engagement to Iz makes a lot of sense. Time to start his new life and devotion to her. I haven't followed the journey as much as others have, but this video still made me feel things.
Out of all the players out there in the league, you brought something that nobody else did, and I don't mean just stats...there's a reason why you are called "the king". Take it from a real old school cod player at 44 years old this year and been playing since cod 3. Thank you for all of these years of excitement and roller coasters, now...I wish you the best of luck and let's give em hell on your last run Scumpy!
scump the king the legend the quick scoping god iv been watching you since i was 16 17 now im 29 iv seen you grow up to the young adult you are today we pretty much grew up together i always admired all the videos you put out on your channel since the beginning i cant believe your retiring please never stop what your doing i know your capable of big things.
This is actually so sad there goes all the comp views 😂😂
If next year's cod ends up being Black Ops 2...
I’m 36 and I been watching you since black ops 2 2012-you got one more round in you-end it with a bang !!!!
Damn… much love…
I been watching u since u since bo2 days
I’ll enjoy every second of it
King Scump
One last year., THE year.   "Robin Hood"- They know who is that "Tesla"- They know who is that "Rocky"- They know who is that "Terminator"- They know who is that   Are we gona know who you are?   Take the saber and make a final charge.                                Best of luck .

This is the darkest timeline. This is the day I’ve been dreading. I’m a 26 year old man that grew up watching this guy do what I couldn’t and is single-handedly the reason I’m getting my ass beat at MW2 right now. One last ride brother. Let’s make this one a banger! Love you Sethyyyyy. OG for life
I remember watching you when I was 10, 23 now and I keep forgetting the people we love also grow up. Gonna miss you champ 😢
💜💜💜💜💜💜
The end of an era. 💔
Goodbye
Make this our year. This year is for scump! Green wall🔥🫡
Almost want to dislike this video but could never do that to the King of cod one last dance let's win another chip go out on top baby # GREENWALL
Love you Seth. Best wishes. Let’s get that second ring on the way out bossman.
I love you man.

Scump I don't know how to put it in words but you were are responsible for all of our childhood memories! The memories that you have instilled in each and every single fan will live on forever! <3
I WAS HERE
Makes me cry 💔
This actually brought tears to my eyes bro. Sounds weird but we all grew up 10 or so years ago watching this guy and Nadeshot, now he finishes his career as we step into the real world and find our own paths; where’s the last 10 years gone? Regardless of the trophies, appreciate you keeping me entertained and giving me an escape through the tough years and will continue supporting the green wall as we all grow old Tryna figure this shit out. Best of luck with whatever’s next g and thanks again for the memories 🤝❤️ #greenwall

Bro I watched you my whole life 🙃
😢
long live the king! 💚 crazy watching you grow your brand and grow with optic throughout the years, through the light and the dark, you always brought a smile to my face! good luck on your future ventures 💚🖤💚🖤💚
I’m so glad I discovered you in 2013 through the KSG nuclear video. Been watching you ever since whether it is YouTube, competitive, twitch, or socials. You’re my goat and a big inspiration! The competitive scene will miss you, but I know that you’ll be doing great things on Twitch and YouTube. You deserve this KING 💚🫡

The one and only, absolute OG of the game. One last clutch up before you're off the scene. You deserve greatness.
damn
Sad to see the GOAT GO!!!
One more year
You truly are the GOAT and the King Seth. Can't wait to watch you this coming year! Mostly though, can't wait to see what's next for you the year after!!
Scump is the 🐐🐐 i bet he would push longer if the games weren't so terrible.
Last year? Oh boy, we needed this so we could pack the venues
Legend.goat. thank you enough said
feel pain..
Enough to make a grown man cry 😢
THE MAN   THE MYTH   THE LIVING LEGEND         THE G.O.A.T  There is only one KING and his name is SCUMP
My guy!
Bro I grew up watching you Seth. You were my hero. Every tournament waiting for optic was a treat, and still is. Win or loss. I love watching optic and my favorite players strive. Truly an amazing career and you will never be forgotten. Love you scump.
I love u Seth I wish you never came to this conclusion I will stick w you through your YouTube content no doubt but I support you thank you for all the great memories over the years . You are my GOAT❤️
T2P 4Ever Bring home champs one last time
Honestly speechless…. I started watching competitive call of duty because of you! It will never be the same
Sup scump
Long live the 🤴
It’s crazy how someone I’ve never met before can have such a huge impact on me. When I went through hell and back growing up you and nade got me through all those hard days. It’s Sad to see you go but I’m more so excited to see what’s next for you. The story isn’t over just yet……Time for one last ride.
💚🖤
gay
Now this is how you make a retirement announcement video. The telling of his story in such a small amount of time but each segment of his life is clearly noticeable— literally gave me goose pimples and a little watery eyed.  If you retirement does go through after this season, there is only one thing to do....destroy the competition along the path. Regardless, you will be missed in the competitive scene. Long Live the King.
10 years watching seth and watching this brings so many memories I feel sadness but time moves on all the OGs will always see Seth as one of the people who made cod fun to watch so many watched Seth and so many loyal fans will continue to support him in whatever he decides to do I legit wanna cry because for all the OGs it's not just about simple cod we watched him for most of our lives so he feels more than just a cod player he feels like a brother
Damn Scump 💔 everything does come to an end but it was great while the journey lasted we'll still watch your videos for a very long time.
And just like that, CDL will die. A legend. Whether he is the GOAT or not is debatable, but Crim, Karma, JKap, etc never had the same effect on people as Abner.
1 more year and the CDL will never be the same with the King hope you get a ring for this last year Seth 🙏
Bout to cry
LETS FUCKING GO
He took 1 look at MW22 and said fuck playing that for 2 years.
Tbe optic scump.
#6050
Thanks for all the good games over the years and I hope you gonna keep doing some content your biggest fan from denmark
Tell my why I’m crying
I actually felt my heart sink CoD will not be the same without its king. Honestly never thought I would see the day.💚🖤💚🖤love you king can’t wait for what’s next. I’ll be right behind you as always!
I havent been keeping up much with CDL but i feel like this season is going to be one we will remember for a long time
Guys he’s not done with the game, just competing lol it’s not that serious 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
Grew up watching you, cant believe were here
Whats next??
I'm 31 years old and feel like I've been friends with you for years... Hope you're successful in everything you do in the future! Love ya buddy!
One final year to get another ring and one final chance for us all to say goodbye to a true call of duty legend
Damn Seth, this took me back to when I was 12, 10 years ago. Made me shed a tear, thank you for everything. The GOAT
The feels! Thankyou. You did more for alot of us teenage boys than you could ever imagine with your platform and success you stuck true to you. Lessons. Best wishes.

True legend, a true gamer
This shit so crazy bruh I’ve been watching this man since I was 12/13 I’m 22 now it’s going to be so different not seeing him compete.
i'm crying...legit
Started watching you at 12 here I am now 24 and still supporting you.
Insane that im old enough to see Scumpy retire. I know he isn't "old" but just insane to see the prodigy finally hang it up...Until someone needs a player for a tourney ;)
Last ride let’s get it.
Damn, literally got goose bumps and teary eyes. Knew it would happen at some point but was hoping it wouldn't.
No please nooooo
What a video! Seriously Seth, you were there whenever I was going through things and you brought me back to a better place. Thank you for always being someone all of us can look up to and strive to be. Goodluck this season and in the rest of your life for what’s to come. Looking forward to seeing you in the future! Best of luck Scumpii!

The Greatest Call of Duty Player in the History of Call of Duty .
You Made my childhood! Do what you gotta do, it’s been a great run. You’re a legend to everyone
Sad day in the cod community but you deserve the break scump we’ll always be here man
La Leggenda, Il Re 👑
the ending with seth cya!!!  man  got me there
This is really the end of an era. Time is going by too fast.
That’s massive   No one has called their shot   No one has had the weight on their name to call their shot   The man  The goat  The legend
Fuck I literally just subscribed.
Thank you SCUMP! Let’s win this one for old times sake!!
GOOD LUCK IN THE FUTURE KING COD SCENE WILL MISS U 😢😢😢
Time flies by so fast, Makes me realize I’m getting older… been watching you since bo2, thanks to you I started playing comp, thank you sethy for everything ❤️
Bro, its going to be so sad to see you leave. I know youre going to see a million comments like this but I have to just say my piece. I didnt start playing COD until I was 19 during the BO1 era and was a casual up until BO2. I completely fell in love with the game and league play, so I decided to start seeing what I could find on youtube to help up my game and thats when I stumbled upon Optic Gaming. I loved the live coms from you and Nade  and you cant forge the epic vlogs form the optic house. Even though im an old man (31) I still love jumping on and playing with my friends and we even have watch parties for CDL matches. (unfortunately I am a huge Nadeshot fan boy so i became a LAT fan once he bought a franchise spot). But i guess with all this ranting i just want to say that watching you over the past 11-12 years has been a huge part of my life and I want to say think you for all the awesome memories and great content youve created along with all the other current and past members of optic. The CDL will be so different without the king. I wish you nothing but luck in your future endeavors. LONG LIVE THE KING!
T2P KING
no way the legend is going. it feels like we grew up watching him. my heart shattered, one last ride.
King
I love ya scumpii
This video made me emotional. Such a huge part of my childhood. I can’t wait to see what is in store for you next. Go out with a bang this year.
This edit is absolutely beautiful, forever my GOAT
Sad times…ong Sad times, was a big part of my childhood,now the only reason why I watched CoD is gone.
Wow congrats on a amazing career, you always deserved more than just the one ring. Hopefully this year you can make that happen. Became a fan of yours back during B03 and been watching ever since! Best Cod pro to ever watch imo.
Bro the fucking nostalgia im in tears COD GOD bow to the KING 👑 1 last ride.
My childhood bro
This made me tear up
...damn. GG's my man
Grew up watching you man, i started competing and did everything I could to make it professionally just so I could be like you. This last year is definitely going to be special for ya, I just know you’re going to pop off every event. King of Call of Duty 🙇‍♂️
One you were the one i took after and paid close attention to everything you did and you made me the cod player that i Am today!
Scump and Nadeshot made me a OpTic fan 😭😭😭😭😭💚💚💚💚😭😭😭😭😭💚💚💚💚💚💚😭😭😭😭😭💚💚💚💚💚
Man love you Scumpii!!! You’re one of the greats dog! One last dance!
I’m literally dying 😢
Knew this day was coming, but damn. You are literally the greatest cod player ever. No one like you my brother. Hope for continued success in whatever you decide to do.
😣🥺
Get’s engaged and puts up the sticks. All jokes aside, It’s going to be weird watching COD without seeing Scump’s name in the killfeed. Been watching since BO2 and this truly is the last of the legacy leaving.
Who else is crying?!
Damn scump, hanging up the sticks. Thanks for the amazing childhood best of luck in the future
1 more year. Let's gooooo! Video hit me in the feels
Yo honestly, I think the day he actually retires I'll cry myself to sleep.. I have been watching since bo2 and obviously content will remain but that's just not the same.. feels like some part of my childhood just died. Wish I could have seen this guy live once, maybe I'll manage champs but yeah, thanks for all the memories scump. Will always remember things like you and Nadeshot dancing in the old house, the OpTic house days in general. When you and Matt screamed on stage, or you in the listen in "sexy man".. Or even the old days of bo2 and the memorable plays being made..
Nahhhh man  This shit is crazy. The time is offically here
Noooo 🥺❤️
Scump and OpTic were the reason I got into COD... They were the reason I always wanted to be a competitive COD player... They were my entire teenage years. I will be going to an event this year and I better hear "Thank you Scumpii" chants. One last dance......
Dam😢
A lot of us grow up and tend to out grow things we did in our childhood, but Scumpii and the Green Wall is something we NEVER out grew
It's crazy to think Scump has been competing at the top level since BO1. Getting to meet you, Hector, Will, and the rest of OG at UMG Philly was probably the coolest gaming moment I've had. It's been one crazy ride through all the ups and the downs we always had your back and will even after this chapter comes to an end. Let's get ready for one last crazy ride. Best of luck this year Seth.
THEE G.O.A.T!!!! Scump I have been following you probably since the beginning you were always the best on the sticks!
My gaming idol growing up !! We the same age and from the start of your career I was a huge fan and you inspired me to push in the competitive cod community and it led me to mild accomplishments and great memories! Thank you for all the years and I’ll be rooting for 1 last ring for the final outting!!!
Wow
Living Legend ❤❤❤
Damn I was here since the start 😕 now this is the End, time Flys
Wow, that was so beautifully done
The best ever 🐐
Scump I've been watching you since black ops 2 your a staple to the call of duty scene lets make this last year one hell of a year been amazing watching you all these years and thank you for the memories much love and respect brotha #GreenWall lets kick some butt this year
Fuck them up Scump 💪🏽
“IM THE BEST IN THE GAMEEEEE” ~scump
i'm not crying, you are🥲
Deadass made me tear up a bit, I’ve been following since the beginning. Can’t wait for this new chapter. GG’S
Long live the King.
damn man i was 10 when i started watching you
I remember watching when he wasn’t even old enough to play in a COD tournament because he wasn’t 18. It’s been a long journey but all great things must come to an end. You will always be remembered ❤
Fuck man were all really grown up
loved your videos since i was in elementary school now im in college 🖤🖤
Ur a legend
I remember being 12 years old watching him drop 100 bombs on bo2. It’s been 10 years and you’re still my inspiration. I love you scump ❤ one day we will meet
I’ve literally watched you since the MW3 livestream on the YouTube. You got me through so much of my childhood and got me into cod. You will always be the GOAT in my opinion. Make this last ride a good one Sethy 💚🐐
I believe I speak for all grown ass men in their 20s and early 30s, you were OUR childhood bro. We love you Scump, thank you for giving us years of content and love. Green Wall for life 💚
Seth man you were pro I remember watching you and Nadeshot man those were good times
im gonna miss u scump!
To think we've been watching this man for over 10 years is crazy. Scump has given so many people the hopes to follow their dreams. You have inspired so many of us. Your Job here is done. What a career my dear friend.
Goodbye OpTic Dynasty :(
Last year.... BECOME FUCKING GREAT THEN! END THIS on the note we all want! goodluck
This made me tear up great video. Scumpii you are the goat hands down
I already know what this video is gonna be about, so I'm gonna live in denial and not watch this video. My childhood, my cod memories, my clips, everything I ever did on cod was inspired by scumpy. We'll all miss you king💚
Dam….
I got scared. I thought you was retiring now and I would never get the chance to watch you play live. I will be there watching you live this year
wow this hit
Sad to see you go as competitive cod player. Let’s give our last big shot to win majors and champs.
This one hurts worse then Tommy's vid. Thank you Seth for all the years of dedication.   I'm not sure what else to say but thanks.
Not even sure how to feel. But I’m glad it’s ending on your own terms, you deserve it. Now the important part, as you said - One Last Dance.
You are one of the main reasons we all kept playing Cod. You will be forever  LEGENDARY ‼️ Peace and Blessings and Super  much more success in whatever you may do. 💯
Competive COD takes a MASSIVE blow when you retire after this year. You can make the argruement that Karma or Crimsix have had more successful professional careers but Scump ascended competitive COD. He has been a consistant force for a decade of COD, his YouTube channel has furthered competive COD, his blogs, the Optic House, his personality, everything. Put all of that together and he is the GOAT of COD.
Just got fucking chills make it count man end it with a fucking banger
made my ass tear up
Straight chills... Way to go, Scump. Way to leave your mark on this whole community for a lifetime. Best of luck this season!
At least we get a farewell tour and not just a hard end to an era
LAST YEAR ON THE WORST GAME????? NO WAY
You are my Michael Jordan.
Thanks for the memories👑 A lot of guys are playing to pay the bills. Scump has the money, it’s time. Call of Duty as we always knew it is finally dead. The end of an era. CoD4 up to Black Ops4 were some of the greatest moments ever
i really cried nooooo bruh i still look up to this ma....... i forever will
Was not expecting this. Happy for you
HAIL THE KING 👑👑
Damn bro this shit hit too deep I’ve been watching since bo2 you’ve changed lives forever we love u man it’s your year
You got me into the CoD scene. One of the best to do it.  Long live the king.
Scump ima miss you ✌🏽
End of an era thank you for the years of endless entertainment
Man this doesn’t feel real
Thank you for the memories and unforgettable childhood Seth you and Nade inspired me to start playing cod and you both still inspire me to this day. Let's make this last year a special one legend 💚💚💚
Instant goosebumps - absolutely amazing video, genuinely moving - best of luck with the one last hoorah! 💚
Love you scump ❤️☹️ like everybody else said you were my childhood sucks but I wish nothing but the best for you man.

I’m going to cry if this is real!
Legend
Scump is forever the GOAT of COD... you can't tell me otherwise.
BRUH THEY F-ING CALLED IT HOLY SH!T! CoD is done for 😭🤣
Amazing to let the visuals tell the story, only the best for the goat.
We love you stump always and forever 😭❤️
I fuks with Hector. But my G, like Mr.Slime said you have a special place in our life's. We love you, appreciate you and wish you the best.#LetsGoGreenWall#Greenwall4Life.
So sad tbh :(
Literal tears. Please make a team, the cod gods depend on you
Make the last one a historic one. Lets go optic 💚 lets go seth 💪🏼
The fact I’ve been watching Scump since I was 9 years old it’s crazy to me how I’m 16 and he’s gonna be retiring from pro play this year the person who inspired me to wanna play pro.
The best to ever do it. Love you Seth❤.
Goodbye scump, thank you
Thankyou Scumpii, forever the peoples champ🥇
Fuck this hurts, my all time favourite pro CoD player.. Haven't watched CoD content or any tournaments in a while but if this is the last year imma have to find the time and watch the legend play at least one more time. GOAT. Absolute GOAT.
Legends never die. They become immortalized to the point of becoming all knowing, all existing and will remain an icon for years and eons to come. Never removed and yet will never be forgotten. Scump is the love, the passion and the people's champ of the most popular fps franchise of all time. Without him the fire nation will most definitely invade but only time will tell. We all love you scump, you absolute LEGEND.
holly shit i'm in tears bro, you've reached so many people. Can't wait to watch you take this last championship brotha
Damn😢!! Me and my daughter teared up watching this. She’s a big scump fan just like me. Let’s make this a great one.
Long live the King.
Holy shit. I never thought we'd see the day. This truley is a change of guard. You've pathed the way for many in this indusy Seth. forever a legend.

LONG LIVE THE KING 👑

I'm crying!! Scumpii you are my idol !! You are the best, you are the KING !!
Sad moment this
Y’all acting like he’s dying 😂. It ain’t that serious.
I don’t think any YouTube video has ever made a bigger impact on me. Love you Seth. Thanks for being apart of my life
I cried love you man congrats on a great career! Now get out there and win another ring before you out!
Forever changed the game, Rest up brotha 💯
Damn dude...heavy.  Love the throwback to the gaming as a kid withe the brick TV and Xbox and old couch I felt that shit.
Well this was overly dramatic
Yo yo yo. It’s been real ahhhh see ya
Bro I've been following you since BO1... This breaks my heart man! Been rooting for optic for so long! I grew up watching you fry every time again and again. The scene will never be the same without you man 😭
Thank you KING 👑💚
Thank you Scump 💪🏾💯💪🏾
One last ride for the 👑
Scump is the goat but the production on this video is fucking INSANE such a cool concept
I’m grown asl lowkey tearin up 😭 I’ve been watching since like 4th grade and I’m 19 now I loved the journey
Aint no way. Scump you gone always be the 🐐
Shit man this video well made. But wow sucks. I can see myself not watching cod after this year. Scumpii is the reason I watch competitive cod. And yes I’m a scump lover and I’m aloud to be I graduated and played football with the man before he quit football for cod.
This video is amazing. Atleast we get to experience 1 more year.
Them visuals were MADDDDDDD
You can’t be havin me cryin at work like this seth
Noooo comp cod is never gonna be tha same
im bouta cry
This video hit the entire BO2 community for sure …. What a legend !!! Career !!! Your place is always at the highest stage .
Damn man, we knew the day would come sooner rather than later and still nobody could prepare us.  Announcing your retirement before the season starts, putting all the pressure on your back to make it a fulfilling year - that's a powrmove. I tip that
Knew this was coming and I’m still shook. 😢
After Snipedown retired from Halo, I was worried you were down too based on the title. Go get it this year! We’re behind you, man
Sad to see that its your last year, but I can't wait for the content grind.
Growing up blows....from the main stage to the live commentaries you are the greatest to ever do it!
what a video..
dude i used to watch u alot during the faze times , lol i will say i was not the best watcher of you but i did follow very well
I’ll never forget the crib that him, Nadeshot, merk, and bigT we’re in. Bo2 times
🐐💚 the greatest call of duty player ever  - you have carried this game on your back all these years and im glad you are going out on your terms
My favourite professional cod player! What a career you’ve had scump! Let’s go optic 💚💚💚💚💚💚
Thanks for all the good memories! You were my childhood! Support from Costa Rica 🇨🇷😟

The GOAT
One last dance it would be cool if it was optic vs theives final the dark prince vs the king just to pass the torch to the young guys also thanks scump for inspiring me to pick up the sticks again and play cod ❤❤ I have nothing but respect for u ❤
Those sounded like WW2 hitmarkers
You truly deserve the title of GOAT.
a legit legend.
You can retire from competitive but you can’t retire from creating content
Later nerd!!! (with love) :)
Hell of a guy, thanks for the memories
The goat
Going to miss you bro :(
“I ain’t as good as I once was…but I’m as good, once, as I ever was…”

Scump is cod and cod is scump. I hope you find nothing but peace and happiness when it’s all over brother. Long live the King🫡🫡👑👑👑
Didn't expect to cry today and yet here we are. Gah damn it. You single handedly got me into esports. I knew nothing about them until I started watching you and I've been hooked and followed you ever since around AW. You we and always will be the King!
the only constant in life is change, imma enjoy this last year
Good for you man, hope you have a great final year

Wait why do I have that exact same couch
You had a great career, and know that what you did for Console eSports will be remembered for ever.
Even though I haven't played call of duty in like 5 years , this still makes me sad man. End of an actual era Scump. Hopefully you'll still be sweatbannin in pubs for years to come 👍
What a beautiful career, King of COD <3
I can’t handle this dawg. Even as a lifelong envy fan (I guess now it’s all the same) I respected this dude to no end. Now that the end is in sight I can’t help but feel sick..
WHAT 😢
Getting married bet there’s a kid on the way too good on you scump been watching you for about 8 years + , always put it on
Thank you for making me love call of duty man! And thank you for the greatest 10+ years of making my childhood! I’m one of the biggest optic fan but that wouldn’t have happened if I didn’t stumble on your account one day randomly with your iconic “yo yo yo”, thank you man! From the bottom of my heart❤️❤️‍🔥 thank you for everything🥲
We love you Optic scumper the penis pumper
Time to take that step into being a commentator. You was a natural at the HCS. Let’s kill it this year and get that SHIP. End this chapter on a high note. Much love.
THE GOAT NOW AND FOREVER
🫡💚
A fantastic video, I've been watching the Optic guys for over a decade now and to see that this era is coming to an end really does close a chapter in my watching of not just Scump, but cod esports, excited to watch the last dance!

Been following Scump for 12 years, competitive Call of Duty will not be the same without the King!  This was an awesome announcement video, lots of memories.

Whenever I hear CoD, my mind thinks of this man right here. Hope you have a great last year in the league champ
Godspeed seth you were the whole reason i even got into comp gaming you inspired so many people and really was one of the first stand out people to show that you can make gaming a career for that youll not only be a legend in the cod community but gaming as a whole thank you
Bring me back to 2013 please
No I can't believe it.  I have to see you in MN this year 100%
No don’t go we love you scump
Initial I thought Scumpi was saying good bye to YouTube or Warzone.  But it's going to be very sad when we don't see Scump ever again in the CDL🥺.   I hsve been watching Scumpi and Comp Cod since he really first stepped up to the scene.  We will miss u @Scump
Great video Scump. Well thought out executed perfectly
What a journey. 🥲
It's been a pleasure to be able to watch you from day 1 to days end. For most just another video but I literally grew up with this guy. He will always be the goat
This just hits different, He's the KING
Damn I dreaded the day this would happen. I truelly hope this year ends with OpTic taking Champs..! Send The KinG off Correctly
Thank you for everything, can’t believe it’s coming to an end, happy it happened ❤️
never cried as a grown man until now
:O???!?!
you are the whole of cod esports :D I've never watched any of it but you are the only pro cod player I know as PC gamer.

It’s gonna be freaking EPIC!!! ONE MORE RIDE!!
I mean, he was my favorite streamer to watch...but this was a WIERD video hahaha
Omg I was about to cry and then he said he's got one more year. That makes me so happy. This is it. Optic cops their second Champs ring this year.
Let's go scumper! Been watching you for about a decade and you inspired me and so many others! Can wait to watch you and be the GOAT you're!!
what a masterpiece of a video
I discovered you back in BO3 and you completely changed the way I look at gaming and life in general. You were the first person to inspire me to wake up everyday and strive to become a better version of myself. Thank you for everything
Wow this just gave me goosebumps…
🤴
Maybe he's calling it quits coz cod is getting shiter and shiter and he knows it but big respect to wot he has done fair play
Last Dance 😭

Gonna say I’m surprised it wasn’t sooner they keep making shit games this is what happens been watching since BO2 call of duty will be nothing without you bro
Gonna be sad to see a legend go, remember watching you at EGL5 in Blackpool competing as apeX, someone to look up to in the Cod world! Good luck on the next ventures and thank you for being part of many peoples childhood!!

Didn't expect to be crying today. Gonna miss ya on the big stage. You have made video games way more enjoyable over the years. Good in wherever life takes you.
Man I never thought I’d cry over a legend leaving because of what I seen him accomplish and the memories he gave also the classes thanks for that but in all seriousness this man has been a idol to me and my life watching his streams and watching his montages it just gives me chills I first knew him as scump but now I know him as Seth much love peace
I felt the crossmap kills segment with my entire being. I grew up on BO2 and that’s where I discovered the pro scene, and namely optic. Crazy to think it’s been 9 years.  Good luck to you champ, on this final year and whatever the future brings. 😢🎉
So excited for the opportunities that come along retiring but also sad to see this…. From Albert Pujols to another goat Scumpi Retiring in the same calendar year😢💚
I will not lie I have been watching scump from day 1 and after seeing this literally made me cry
One last ride. you’ve brought us memories tht will last forever scump. thank you sethy💚
No way.
When Scump retires, I’m gonna be an emotional wreck. Dude has literally been my Codfather for 12 years 😢
Will go down as one of the greatest and will never stop being my favorite
Wish nothing but the best for you! You deserve to live your own life after all you’ve brought to the call of duty and Optic community. The legend #GreenWall

I haven't watched/played Call Of Duty in years. But i do remember the old Optic house days and how much fun it was watching Scump and all of Optic. I'll miss the golden days, but life goes on.
Wow I just realized how old I’m getting all the people I admired growing up are starting to retire 😢 let’s make this last year a great one Seth ‼️
🐐
Wow I haven’t watched cod videos in a long time but to see this video is kinda crazy, the memories through school - Thankyou Seth
I really never comment on videos, and have almost stopped playing entirely.. but to whoever had the inspiration for this video - it was phenomenal and hit hard as im sure many of us have grown up watching yourself/optic.  You’re an outstanding player and forever a goat. Smash this year.
Yo Yo Yooo.! Thank you Seth for all the great Cod content over the past 10 years! SsseeYa!
One of my childhood hero’s
the reason i even touched the sticks. this will be one hell of a year i can already see it.. WITH YOU TILL THE END KING!! LOVE
What an impact you've had brotha, COD wouldn't be where it is without you.
I grew up with you man and were literally a huge part in my childhood. I’ve bleed green, white and black since the 6050 days. Thank you for all the amazing memories and crazy moments. I look forward to seeing where you go next ❤️🙏  Edit: p.s. this made a 25 year old man shed a tear 😢
Shit this year will be epic
What a man ❤
😢😢😢
Once a legend always a legend this man was literally half of my whole life and all of my childhood. Crazy to see him going after this year. Looked up to this man like no other. 😢
First and foremost great videos Seth. Love it. Secondly, this will be a sad time in the call of duty world. You were an icon, cod legend the goat. Bro im sad that you might retire i love all you videos. I still watch your black ops2 videos today. Even ghost black ops 3 etc... You will be truly missed bro. Im happy and grateful to come across someone like you. Your awesome. Whatever you decide to do retire or keep gaming on you have my full support. Much love my red haired friend 😂.
Been a fan since the beginning brotha. You were, you are, and you will always be the GOAT 🐐. Hope you still do content after man cheers 👏 ✌️ 😃
GOAT
I've been here from the beginning till now, might as well go all the way...
Holy fuck I got the chills when the video ended. I’m the same age as scump and I have been watching since the beginning. I’m scared the CDL will die after this year. 😢
me love scump
He picked the right year to go out on with an IW title
🐐
been literally following scumps journey since the start. Almost makes me cry, he really is the GOAT and the reason i always tried hard in COD's lmao
When that day comes I will cry 100% already emotional when I seen this video 🥺
Omg
Goes to show how much this cod sucks it forced scump to retire XD
You're the man Seth.

G.O.A.T 🐐

Best to ever do it. Congrats on the legacy sir
Bro. Why you had ti make me cry 😢
Greatest SMG to touch the game. Pull a Brady and lock back in one last time for MWII. The kids on Addies just got movement crutch nerfed 😔
This feels like the end of a chapter, our childhood.
I knew this day had to come but why, I cant I just cant... End it with another ring KING
"WHO'S THE BEST IN THE GAME BABYY!!!!" Love ya Scump, you inspired millions and continue to do so..
I appreciate this video from the bottom of my ❤. Thank you for creating all those memories, I’ve watched scumpii since BO2 and always loved his content. So thank you once again…

Omg whoever made the storyboard for this video deserves a massive raise.... what an incredible production, i was too blown away with the production quality to even process scumps announcement....
Used to watch your youtube and streams everday in middle school and here I am about to graduate college. You helped me get away from all the madness and what you crontibuted to the COD community will never be matched brother. Thank you for everything and I wish you the best of luck. Kill it this last year.
There's no way I'm watching this
All hail the king. No one will ever do it better.
Nice video.  You will be missed but it will bring even more excitement as we watch your last year on duty.   It sure will be a happy ending.  Great going sir!   You will Be Missed!    But hope to see you around.    It was your Call!      Can I have your computer? Lol
The reason I fell in love with competitive CoD back in MW3. Doesn’t feel real that this is actually going to end.
LONG LIVE THE KING 🤴
Absolute fire. Goosebumps, frog in the throat, tear in the eye. Absolute Perfection! #ThankYouScump
Scump goated thts all I know
Bye
💚
I AM A GROWN MAN NOW SCUMP YOU ARENT ALLOWED TO MAKE ME CRY
I wish I could explain to you the impact you have had on millions of young kids who wanted to be just like you Seth. Been watching you since I was 10 and now I am 20 years old and it feels like I have grown up not only watching you but with you as well. I hope this last year is everything you'd imagined it would be and you are able to bring one last ring home to Optic where it belongs. You are an inspiration and forever a legend in the scene of esports, the people's GOAT <3
CoD GOAT make it a memorable year sethy boy.

No matter what happens this year we can say Scumpii is the GOAT SMG

Scump is the Eminem of Call of Duty
The god
Actually the best call of duty player of all time no doubt. Since childhood you’ve been playing these games it’s ingrained in our hearts and will never leave the true gamers and fans. Well wishes to this next and last year we will all miss it so much and cod will never be the same again. ❤
Not many things that move me, but this was one of them. I saw you growing up, I’m 24 now and I still get excited watching you play. From seeing you go crazy, to losing some hard fought battles, to going nuts in the Warzone competition, it all has been a great journey. Can’t wait to see where you go from here. Say hi to optic predator for me 🎉
scump i want you to know that so many have watched you over the years and dreamed of your life! you've inspired the best of us to thrive in shit situations and cherish the best! In a way we grew old together and i wish you the best of luck outside of COD and so much more. Thanks scumper jumper. -TheBoysYouNeverMet
This hit different 🔥
Dios te bendiga, Dios te guié, Dios te lleve por el buen camino, Dios te apoye, Dios te proteja, Dios te haga tomar buenas decisiones, Dios te cuide y Dios te dé salud

Whilst I haven't been an OG fan throughout my time following cod, you were part of my favourite ever cod team (Yourself, Nade, Clay, Proof) and that was the most fun I ever had following the scene and whether I've been rooting for or against your teams it's always been a pleasure watching you compete. Thanks for everything.
Damn thats crazy watching him from 6th grade to now being a semester away from graduating college congrats scump was awesome watching you
we are getting old boys
King 👑
Legend
This actually has me tearing up. Can't believe I started watching optic and scump since I was 10. Now I'm 21, and to think that over half my life I spent watching this man and this brand is crazy. I'm really going to cherish this last year we have. Last dance man
This video  is a piece of gold. No one will ever replace Seth.

Haven’t played competitive since black ops 2, but man this hit the feels.
I’m going to fucking cry dawg. My childhood into adult
Legend
I’m already crying
“Yoyoyo, it’s ya boy Optic Scumpy here”, this hits hard.
Wow it really is the end of an era after Scump retires.
Noooooooooo....that is sad to hear but thank you for bringing this game and community up. You will forever be the King of CoD, there is no other. Good luck and congrats on the engagement.
Honestly he should have more rings, he has no one to back him up.
Sheeesh 1 last dance he said
Going out with a champs W, thank you Seth goat
The chills 🥶
Crazy how I basically grew up with them, Started watching Optic since the MW2 Optic PR3DAT0R days.. Sucks to see, But i know he’s going to kill it on the content side
Cant blame him. This game is wack ass fuck lol.
This man changed a generation. Heres to one last run.
Sad 😢
Holy shit Scumpii, make this shit memorable. You guys got it this year, let's fuckin go!!!
One of the best to touch a controller. A legend in and out of the game. His impact was bigger than the game. What an incredible career, now it’s time to see what comes after this year and I’m all here for it. Time to buy a racing sim setup and race Crim 🤣
The King. The Ginga Ninja. The CodFather.
Crazy I remember watching you in mw3 you’ve been on a crazy journey and I think most everyone can say thank you for letting us join you on that journey, Good luck in all future endeavors gonna be weird not seeing you competing best of luck
Bruh… I actually shed a tear love u Scumpii💚💚
Mam first Snip3down and now Scump. 2 legends in their games. E sports will never be the same. Thank you for all the enjoyment watching you battle at the peak for so long.
Let's go out on top KING!
Perfection.
I've not been following as long as some of the others. But Scump's YT channel is what introduced me to competitive COD. I've followed ever since clicking that first video. Even when it's not gone the teams way, it's been a fun ride. Your vibe is amazing dude, it's genuinely fun to watch you play and compete.   Have an amazing last year goat, and we will all be here after still 😎
I've been a fan of scump for years, this shit got me emotional
what a crazy ride its been growing up watching you. i feel 12 watching you fry up some bo2, hard earned and a career no one will soon forget. thank you for every moment, king Scumpi.
So many memories.... Legend
Damn I still got chills even 10min after watching it. Watched this man from the very beginning. From before optic. I hope they bring home fucking everything this year!! Fuck em up man!
Been a fan of you since b02. You are my inspiration for playing cod , competitive all that. Thank you for putting out the content and just being you for over the years!!!
Wow. Fantastic video. Where did the time go. Have a great year seth
This guy got me into video games! Much respect to you Scump. Bring home that championship one last time.
Chills
i was fine holding in tears until i heard “theya”
4 years in a row all of the dynasty members are retiring, damn
Let’s make this year count 🐐 #greenwall
much love from germany
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ok Jesus Christ that was scary for a minute there
I could make myself cry dead ass. I’m gonna be rooting for you guys with all my heart. Win worlds and retire like the goat you are! You got this.
Absolute Goat, nuthing to prove...but go ahead n show em all once more👊💯
I'm crying so fucking hard right now.... What the fuck man. Fuck you IW... Fuck you Activision. Fuck you so much. This man IS CALL OF DUTY!
All good things must come to an end....but legends never die....they live on in our hearts.....
Not gunna lie. He had me in the first half coach. But then said one more. Dead ass almost cried
Shit man hell of a run much love
noooo this can't be true you are the GOAT I hope you well in your future it's been a blast watching you from when you joined to now leave loved all the content and funny moments #GOAT
NO BRO😪
Man… i just got off work and you gotta the tears going right away 😢 GL this year Sethy and thank you for everything you’ve done for CoD. Can’t wait to see you on stage for one more year, really hope you guys can grab another chip or 2 and hopefully 1 more ring as well 🙏🏼 After that, can’t wait to see what you do for content moving forward. You are THE GOAT. Much love, always man ❤️❤️
A perfect video.
And that's how you know CoD has gotten bad.
Copy that!! Time for the new chapter in your life, your own family. Congrats on popping the question to your better half.
This is how it’s supposed to be done! It brought a couple of tears but what a long ride been watching him for 10+ years! That’s wild to think about.
I'm now 35 years old and always been a huge fan of Scump & Optic.  Fuck it sucks getting old guys. Feels weird Scump retiring.  You younger gamers enjoy the fuck out of the time you have. Cos maybe 10% of the people I used to play still do and it's just not the same anymore. Miss TF out of it. X
From the UK, supported you all the way through. Thanks for the good times champ ❤️
Bro stop like just post a cod vid once ina while dont retire
Was was gold
Literally a massive part of my childhood and an inspiration to many. Thank you Scumpii the COD GOAT.
Dam this video gave me chills been a fan for years and I'm excited to see what the next chapter will bring
Literal Tears Bro . Been here watching you compete as my favorite player since ronaldinho shouted you out in MW3 . And never stopped watching since then .  Damn this will be the end of an era forsure . THE GOAT🐐
You got me into video games and then got me into esports truly a king of the people sorry to see you go excited to see what you have planned!
Bro what, just take a break you’re built different, can’t retire 🐐
One more year of the GOAT and it's over 😭😭 Damn man end of 2023 is gonna suck!
The Nadeshot rap in there too oh man I'm weak
GOAT
my God what a career!! I can't count on both hands how many times this man has produced iconic moments in the cod community.  From The Young hungry kid that he was, he turned himself into the King and we all praised. You deserve this brother. Thank you for all the memories 💪🏾💯
This is going to be one of the most emotional CODs ever
Actual goosebumps I’m so sad
I remember in summer 2016 the CWL on BO3, following all your matches before the start of the school. Miss these days, thanks for everything. 💚🖤 Let's go Optic...
OPTIC CHUNKY
💚💚💚
I am crying rn
Cabron. I’m crying.
Forever, the king. 💚
I’ve been watching Scump compete and play CoD since I was a kid. It’s crazy to have basically grown up with this dude through the screen. An absolute legend, an absolute class act. The scene will never be the same. Long Live the King!!!!!!
mans going to cuba
nah not the king 💀
Nooooo 😭
🐐
Noooo not the king
GOAT! Congrats on years of success and I'll be rooting for you this year.  I'm 24, and its been awesome growing up with you, whatever comes next, best of luck Seth!
Much deserved man!

As a viewer and supporter I've been here since 2012 at 11 years , will continue to be here for your future endeavors.
first Snip3down now this? can't fucking take it man.
Has been a fantastic career 🙏🏻
This shit got me emotional
Wow man… this really is it huh. Thank you for all the memories can’t wait to see you compete one last year 🎉
"Heroes are remembered, but legends never die."
Cod has been shit for a decade but scump leaving will likely kill the game forever id say
Bro I’m dead crying
Chills.
No it can’t be… been seeing you compete since black ops 2
That was one of the dopest videos I've seen in a long time. Been watching you for years man. Congrats on retirement... YOU ARE THE GOAT!!!
What a career. Going to be sad for the community when this legend isn’t performing at the highest stage anymore.
I never thought I’d cry over COD, but here we are 🥺😭
Dk how he’s playing this year the game is awfuo
Watch you throughout elementary, middle and high school. Thank you scumper jumper for all the memories. And P.S “YOU ARE STILL THE BEST IN THE GAME” 🫶🏼
I’ve been rewatching a lot of your BO2 videos lately and it was little bit like being 13 again, coming home from school, getting on the game and having so much fun. And then this… Makes me sad to be honest ☹️
omg nooooo😢
Hero’s get remembered, but legends never die! One more dance with the King 👑
The fkn goat man… one last ride
Broooooo wtf
You were apart of my child hood ima miss you man the undeniable goat much love❤
I literally thought he retired. I literally started to cry! 😂 Been a huge fan and supporter bro! You got a community full of loyal fans that appreciate you and can’t wait to just hang out in your streams!! Can’t wait for this year! Let’s get it King!!
The goat is finally taking his leave. This man was the most dominant force in all of COD for the better part of a decade. I wonder who will step up and take his place.
Bruh no this is like the end of my childhood, love you scump thanks for all the memories! Best of luck in whatever comes next!
Been a great run Scump! COD will never be the same.
Karma and Formal should do the last year with him

GOATED
I’m crying man this is the player I’ve been dreading to retire
Bow Down To The God Himself Optic Scumpyy
Sigh
Thank you for everything Seth, words can’t explain the impact you have left on this community, when people think of CoD they think of scump. It’s hard to wrap my finger around this news, however I know all good things must come to an end… here’s to one last dance from the goat, wishing you nothing but the best this season and in your retirement. Thank you for being the face of CoD these last years, thank you for everything Seth.

As Long as you're still making content on YouTube

Even he knows COD is dead. It’s just not worth it anymore, too many handicaps for bad players. Golden age has long been over and it sucks. Activision hates the OGs

Be coach plz
If he retires im crying.
If he does don't blame him mw2 is shocking

There's a code in the description
He is just going to say bye to the last cod
