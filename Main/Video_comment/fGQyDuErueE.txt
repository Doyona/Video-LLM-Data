14:22   “Yo guys I’m not gonna lie I’m gonna elect myself king, sound good??”  “Um. No”😭
Wait I read that wrong 2nd best potato farmer😂
Ixe and Sitama cause a problem, people die, they lose the game for their team.  Every video.  Like clockwork.  It's getting predictable and boring.
So do you hate your own premise or just not care that the same people sabotage every event?
I have never seen ize win an event, he’s always forcing people to let him lead yet leaves his whole team behind, kills his team mates and is so rude. I’m shocked people don’t just take him out the moment they see him
2:20 technooblade nv diess
He placed the block and mines again 2:17
Rip Red The Imposter
this ize guy is so annoying
Silver you should make more videos of civilisation and battle royal
Bro you copied @Ish
Never lose hope in God amen ❤
This comment is 3 years after but. Abstrekt MVP
If I was in the arctic group I’d be elected Ruler cuz I know all of the best holiday winter songs
Ize is super annoying. Hopefully he doesn't show up in others
I don’t think I’m alone when I say that Ize is a fucking dick. Even in the other Minecraft civilization, he was a tyrant who basically acted like he was better than everyone else and the other players were stupid. Despite being a sore loser in reality when he started losing.
6:46  « Oh these aren’t people! » Speedsilver: « And a huge battle with the natives commenced »       Poor editing choice there Scott 😂😂
29:38😂😂😂😂😂
I was 6 wen this released😂
hi i'm a new minecraft youtuber i want to be like you can you help me?
Made 100 Players Simulate Civilization on Batman in Minecraft
Honestly watching this after watching some others I can for sure say that IZE has no right or reason to ever want to be a leader again because all he does it destroy his own team every time
this is peak
Idol of ish
2:24  now it's right
20:16 “Civilization” spelled wrong 😂
20:16 “Civilization” spelled wrong 😂
20:16 “Civilization” spelled wrong 😂
15:10  Based zombie
its 2025 where is speedsilverr
Moral of the story is... always root for the zombie.
Icl the jungle guy pmo
Ize sucks
PLEASE COME BACK WE LOVE YOUR VIDEOS THERE SO GOOD PLEASE IM SPEAKING FOR EVERY SUBSCRIBER
Jungle leader seemed like a reincarnation of machiavelli. However, he forgot that results are only half the way people can hold power.
Do more please
Please bring these back, these are the reason I subscribed to silver
Here for all the Ize hate. Arrogant, belligerent asshole of a dictator with literally 0 redeeming qualities.
21:17 AND ARCTIC HAD THE BEST village
40:06 dude kept repeating "have you ever heard of genshin impact" in his final moments as if he was reciting the shahada 😂😂
YAY I LOVE WATCHING SPEEDSILVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think the artic was the best
Oh yea i forgot  i put a ravager😂
Ize’s death is the definition of what goes around comes around 😊
Was the best potato farmer Technoblade?
Dude I immediately noticed technoblade
if u made a mod for xbox that did this u would make so much money
Ize wanted to move like the British Empire but ended up moving like the Mongol Empire
The head of death 37:49
Is crackling sound being heard only be me or some other ppl are there
I love these types of videos
3 time watching this video its goated
Best karma for the scumbag ruthless jungle king
Jungle not  militaristic❌  communist ✅
2:20 elite ball knowledge required
events like these prove that what really makes games good is thier community
Anyone in 2025?
Ize is literally the funniest player 😂😂
"Led by the best potato farmer.. sorry i read that wrong. Second bedsg potato farmer" rip techno
0:11  Bro Saitama is sooo bored that he is actually playing minecraft😂😂 Imagine if he rages and punches his monitor but breaks his whole gosh darn apartment😂😂😂😂
Ize might be the most obnoxious person I’ve ever watched
ogs that caught the great potato war reference are real ones
Hey the pictures at the end one was trixyblox!
Ize been aura farming for years
2nd best potato farmer is a crazy diss icl
ize loses to star killer in another video so I don’t know what he’s talking about.
this ize guy gotta be the least charismatic person ive ever seen
Your right Technoblade is the best potato farmer😢
Speed just remembered that there was Technoblade
Jungle unded up with the worst leader to be fair he had a fairly realistic approach to why he should be king he was just super shady about it and wasnt a good leader
Desert
Oh what do you know. Ize being a self centered prick again. Who'd have thought
This Ize player just run everything man it would be nice if he just didn't participate in everything
ize is a kid with mental disorder 😂
0:09 I thought techno was actually there
I loved the vidieos keep doing them
Jungle is my favorite
Rip techno
5:00 GET DOWN MR. PRESIDENT!!!!!!!!!!!
I like the jungle more
and this is why facism doesnt work
I LOVED JUNGLE BC THEY war fearless and bloodthirsty
I literally have no idea how Artic got the last place 💀
This will make a sick movie
Course the irish guy started the revolution 😂😂
whys star killer allways a leader
All of the battle royal  made me learn he most important is the friends in the journey
Best potato farmer: 𝕋𝔼ℂℍℕ𝕆𝔹𝕃𝔸𝔻𝔼
"Second best potato farmer" savage
Why saitama and ize always killing star killer.is kind and good
I know this is so old but I was really rooting for the arctic region
Jungle best team worst players
jungle leader was just nazi
“The west has fallen” ahh video
why didnt u spawned a ravenger in the others ur so ubfair i was supporting their team🤬😤😡😠👿👺😾
"He's shouting over everyone and saying the same six things" Why is Ives talking about himself in third person?
ize goat
In wanna play this
Ize: im electing my self as king sound good ? Other player: uhhh no Me:well that was cold🥶🥶💀💀💀
17:57 watching the vid❌ Listening to Mario✅
23:39  nah he has an ear
Arctic is the best town I've ever seen and your puting him it 3rd place look it the jungle tribe desert tribe look it their bases
THE TECHNO ENEMY 2:23
This was awesome! 💯🔥💯 Was low-key rooting for Ize to die 😂 But yeah, congrats to the Desert civilization! 🎉
Why is a SpeedSilver video on ish’s channel
the snow civilization had the best town according to me 😊😊
29:24 like this comment so I can find it again ai don’t wanna lose my spot
40:25 ice
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
who see dashingprune 😮
This is clearly super scripted because the same shtt happens  in other videos in super similar ways.
The mayans the egiptions and the
Ize isn’t the brightest, sad for him he clearly wants to win but doesn’t understand tactics and politics. He is definitely the kind of nerd that if he was big and strong as a kid would be one of the dumb bullies. Honestly didn’t enjoy him in this, he didn’t make for a good villain like you see in other videos, they may be tyrants but a tyrant who can think is more interesting than one who can only click
without ize and saitama this video would be gone trash 25:43 powerful
Ize an opp to everyone in every one of these videos
I just wanted to comment to comment
is there ever gonna be a episode where ize isnt an opp
If u don’t understand why he said second best potato farmer is because techoblade rip 🪦 2:29
Time to rewatch these!
ize made this video less fun to watch
Jungle kingdom was so good in war but they should think about their strength and some stuffs
The best team was the snowy team
“This guys not saying anything we DONT know!!! Boooo!!”
Bro Ize Wants to Take Over the World 🫥
lol the abstrack zombie was so funny😂
ize leading an invasion through the blood moon is like hannibal crossing the alps
that eff5ive jungle guy was so annoying hating ize
No matter what anyone thinks Ice was the best king.
Ize is a massive wanker
i cant fucking believe that the necromancy paid off in the end kkkkkkkkk
make a sequel please
noooooooo sqid kid
that jungle guy that chose to team up w/ dessert that got betrayed has some st.p.d reason 😬
Your editor is tired bro! switch to Hoplite
womp womp ize
The minors🗣️🗣️🗣️
Anyone else actually like Ize? He had a good plan to keep his empire powerful and ready for the inevitable war. Star killer was just sucking up to the others so he can be elected, Ize is at least realistic
The King of the Village litch had a group of criminals working with him💀
why all ways they beteray starkiller 😭😭😭😭
2:21  “So led by the best potato farmer… Wait I read that wrong” TECHNOBLADE!!!! Rest in peace…
easy escape from the hunger event: stay offline for a day
WHY
Nestor!
i like the fact he calls squid the SECOND because technoblades better which is true not being rude or anything
My favorite celebration was Arctic
It’s eyes not spelled eyes ize
Petition to join and group up to trap/kill Ize during the 1st to 2nd day    👇
ARCTIC WAS DEFENDLY THE BEST
This is so cool
Jungle kingdom building random stuff and getting first place while arctic kingdom building things that resemble snow, hsppines and christmass getting last place. Your voting is trully “perfect”…
I liked the arctic kingdom and desert kingdom the most.
WHY IS NO ONE NOTICING THE MOJANG-STYLE ANIMATION AT THE BEGINNING
Please Make More Minecraft Civilization Vids🥲
Last words "Ever you ever heard of genshen impact?
0:09 Did that say rarefaction or am i blind If yes then yippee rian worl
when genshin imapct come oh man.....the feeling!
In the name of the Emperor Almighty, victorious and unshakeable, the ruler of the jungles, deserts and the Arctic Ize, I like yhis bideos🙋🏿
Hi
Desert
The clutch was insane😭🙏🔥
Ngl if I could ever play a Minecraft Civilization server and ize is in it I'll team with him cause he's better than Starkiller in leadership and experience in battle
jungle was easily my favourite due to how reckless they were
Always kill ize and 5aitama and always protect starkiller and squidkid
Le mokey
2:21 rip techno the number 1 potato farmer
I don't know if you guys spotted this but at 28:10 the number of players in jungle were 17 but they turned 18 in the next few seconds💀
Ize is like an (not nice word) is every single video
zombie execution at end xd
What is water prot💀
26:26 Mega walls strats
Do you need to play on PC to be in a video
2024 anybody?
"have you ever heard of genshin impact" -JackTBC
Ize was so damn cocky and just was threating them with power
Rip arctic ❤❤❤
2:22 fav moment (technoblade is number 1)
I was counting on the jungle :(
Wait a minute, isn't squid kid the guy that technoblade has beaten in potatoes?
The war all started cuz of 2 player   Btw I like the snow region really
The war all started cuz of 2 player   Btw I like the snow region really
Please make craftsman civilization too
I feel bad for him sipover copyied this entire thing
In 23:15 THe panda did a Frontflip 😂
The jungle team sounds like the YouTube comments arguing😭😭
We need  more of this! It makes my day 10x better!❤
The zombie: im gonna ruins this guy's entire carrier 15:09
Each Civilization Comparison government Same as  Artic : Canada  Jungle : North Korea Desert:  Luxemborg Ideologies Artic : Democratic  Jungle : Dictatorship Desert : Democratic  Milatry Power  Artic : 3RD strongest Jungle : 1st Strongest  Desert : 2nd Strongest  Economy  Artic :  3RD Biggest Jungle  :  2nd biggest  Desert : 1st biggest Population  Artic : 3RD Biggest  Jungle: 2nd Biggest  Desert: 1st Biggest  Overall DESERT: 🥇 1st JUNGLE: 🥈2nd  ARTIC :   🥉3rd
Ize was not a good leader. A good leader would’ve been patient, and would listen to others ideas.
YASS GENSHIN IS SO FUN
What mods are you using?
I thought Jungle was gonna win😢
R.i.p techno
My opinion I feel like the jungle should have kept some "slaves" from the arctic
When he said “the best potato farmer, no i mean second best” I was laughing so hard
I love seeing ize get destroyed. GG L
The jungle fightet and not camped
25:05 "And one player who didn't got caught off guard by a creeper" *player on screen gets killed by a phantom*   love your videos Silver and can't wait to see what you come out with in your next video!
Bro the background music is Super Mairo Bros Will U.
THATS RIGHTT SQUID YOU WILL ALWAYS BE SECOND TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
bruh curse that ize and saitama
Desert should have made Abstract king
2024 crew like not forcing yall
Jungle team is de imposter 30:43
Simp impact
if commonhat was in this...
Bro Ize’s uprising is one of the best villain arcs ever
Ize got his karma (no reference)
Man, the second option is amazing, I mean, incredibly amazing. It’s just so nice and 😳 ohhhhhhh, makes me want to take the second option to the candy shop.
You should do a age civilization next
Ize is like a Karen
Ize is literally a dictator💀
SQUID KID TECHNOBLADES ENEMY
Didn’t have to do squid kid like that
The ravager:who dares disturb my eternal slumber
Make 100 days in the wild West
Bro I really hate Ize, he always feels like the world spins around him like he assumes he's the best player among his team in every Video bro does not want to give a player the opportunity to stand up for themselves.
Honestly, I don’t really like it that the Arctic lost and I like cold places
where is the Discord?😡😡😡
Genshin impact=gayshit impact
This shi feels like it would be from pvz2 💀 0:17
Speed if you see this can you please make bedrock games?
Jungles karma fr
Who thought about Mario bros u 1:38
Anyone watching this in 2025👇
Damn! That was an insane jorney!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
My favorite video ever
yeah squidkid second RIP TECHNO
Tbh I liked the desert the most they are a bit naive but organized and I loved the zombie killing the last jungle player for their nation. GO  DESERT NATION!!!!🏜🌵🐫
why did artic get worst
I liked thhe army ize wasnt in
I liked the jungle kingdom the best
Ize is such an antagonist and i love it.
jungle
Ize is such a jerk its great. Hes a great villain.
Ngl I would rather follow ize due to his military general type but just my opinion
straight balance, jungle-diamonds, nezerite desert-diamonds food Arctic- minus people awesome you came up with, judging by the appearance of the village where the construction resources are limited
bros editing skills are on a different level
I wonder how funny it would have been if techno was with squid kid
Rest in love Starkillerrr 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️
artic is the best
I still find it hilarious that the only reason there was only one Jungle survivor left was solely because they got lost.
arctic should win or even 2nd😢
Ngl jungle base kinda sucks
00:00 a god has been born
15:18 Invictable has true dedication than us doing school work.
Wait dashingpraud is a YouTuber and he was in a event with a importal pleyer called flamefrags
Love the sponsor honestly
Probably scripted but we up  These all feel like I’m watching the same movie that flashbacks with slightly different events. Star/Ize always are kings/are candidates for king. Ize succeeds in some way and needs to be taken down.
The end of this proves just how annoying Ize is. Frankly he would be eliminated as soon as spotted. Dude talks a big game but take his precious gear away he crumples apart.
Ize is him yall tripping
abstrekt the goat 😂
If I was there I would pick miner then  make an underground base with just my self and build traps
the desert ones are some pidars that suck meat every day
2:28 dude did not need to roast squid that hard
Сегодня поиграю я в майнкампф
It was Ize’s offense that took them to loose
Maybe it’s because privatefearless didn’t want to have the least players in the jungle, so that’s maybe another reason why privatefearless went to war.
“I put more work into returning this stupid undead member then I did any of my school work” so true man
i want more
cool vid but why did silver stop making vidioes
jungle made a mistake charging first they should’ve waited for someone else to charge they had so much potential 😢 Desert was destined to win and Arctic was just stupid for not trying to fight back
the artic was a nice kingdom they were my fav and they had ❤ love
no refugees IZE woulda won, he’s a G
It was survival not hardcore mode
start of the legendary rivary between Ize and starkiller
Amazing video, but I think attic had the most spirit. I wanted them to win the team building competition
Desert
Thank you for fixing ur mistakes about the best 2nd place potato farmer
I just remember that technoblade is the World's Best potato farmer❤
I like Poland
the best video
How to participate
😮😮😮😮 is that squid kid the guy who competed in the potato war with Technoblade  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ARCTIC HAD THE BEST CIVILISATION YOU ARE SO MEANNN
I still think ize should instantly be banned from these events as he ruins everything
im rly happy that i survied there that long tysm for letting me play <3
Rip to the best potato farmer techonblade😊
cool im 22001 comint
22:00
Des
Jungle
Ize is a virgin and it is so shameful .
Ngl, Ize is a jerk.
jungle was my favorite
At 4:57 the guy with the hood cover looks like my Java skin
your the best Silver
I loved how through the whole time the Arctic was having the time of their lives singing Christmas songs and preparing for Christmas. Lol.
Ize on top
14:46 AMONGUS😂😂
9:02 HELL YEAH BABY😂😂
2:21 best potato farmer Technoblade
I wanted the jungle to win so badd
All im saying is if i was in the event i would prob stand by ize
看着看着元神启动了
bro arctic looked the best
I hate Ize. I was in team jungle till they killed king StarKiller😢
40:27
I hated the jungle After eyes became the king I didn't like them anymore and I was rooting for the arctic I wanted the stars to become the king and win
😮
The best potato farme- oh I read that wrong. Second best potato farmer 😂😂😂😂😂
WOW amazing job on this video and why does starkiller always die to Ize
Bro violated squid kid
Where a freakun turkey
Bro disrespect squid kid 😂
bro arctic had best town/base
19:00 that wheat farm fucking sucks
bro i wonder how you made all of this the editing , the  map the people too
Bro the king from the jungle civilization was like Napoleon
Soup is a legend
Love that you used genshin music in the background!! ❤❤
It sucks so much that every video starkiller gets elected and everything is going great and they’re the strongest, but then people like eis just kill him for no reason and then lose the game. Starkiller deserves better.
I hate ize in civilization he is not the type to cooperate with 33 player
Ize can never win
19:06
SNOW KINGSOM SHOULD HAVE WON THE BUILD
2:20 squid kid getting memories of his past trauma with technoblade after speedsilver saying 2nd best potato farmer
I like how squid kid is there hahahaha
why did sueb betray the desert and side with ize it dosnt make any sense!
i would love to be in one but i don't have twitter
Imagine getting pressed over Minecraft village power
tbh i'm glad the jungle king lost, he was an asshole in my opinion
Free isreal
Ize guy was so annoying. Forced himself into control by claiming he was more experienced just to rush in and immediately get his entire civ destroyed. Embarrassing leader.
MORE OF A BLAND DEATHMATCH THAN A COOL EXPERIMENT                -999999999999999999 SOCIAL CREDIT
Wow Ize is absolutely insufferable
I feel bad for star killer he always is the best leader but ize kills him or assasinated
the jungle really had a awful King I mean terrible never mind those words doesn't describe him but starkiller if he was King he could have did a better job by a mile
25:07 "The Player was caught off guard by a creeper" bro that's a phantom
Go to 2:13 and watch closely
Ize  you're the worst Minecraft player in the world and speed silver you have to be crazy to think that people would like content just because you just because you do stuff for people to die me myself I don't think it's good content
Ize isn't a dictator he's just a dick
i liked desert the most
i love your vids i have not been posting lately i hope you start posting more and also wand = OP XD
15:41
15:40
15:39
تحيا مملكة الصحراء! هرمنا يقف بقوة!
Long live the desert kingdom!
Ize is like the most obnoxious kid I’ve seen in these videos, geez.
🇵🇸❤❤❤🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Am i the only one so saw techno blade join
Squid kid is the person that lost against technoblade in the potato wars!!!!!!! That's why he's second best potato farmer!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Ize does nothing except getting himself stacked? But then demands authority because he decided to abandon his team and be selfish? 🤦‍♂️
lave your vids and i go on your youtube channel but i cant find any vids i havent seen
I liked the jungle Kingdom the best. I think Ize did the best.
Lmao for the first time my chosen civ one
Izee is so annoying
Xneserio joined💀💀💀
Do a Pokémon and you louse in a Poke battle you dye
Your a chad 😎😎😎😎
The strat is just immediately kill 5aitama and Ize. Tbh they piss me off a lot.
#technoblade #no.1 potato farmer🐷
i wonder how squid kid felt about technoblade :'(
Dude walked into the creeper
I love arctic
Artic had the most fun
I love how in most of these videos you can spot at least 1 person crouch sprinting lmao
The desert zombie that fell in battle and went through so much and to see him stand up against the kings is really poetic
Ize role in this vdos can be d best example of stupid failure 😂😂😂
if you like genshin impact jump pov the person who jumped https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41RJd5vJZ8L._UXNaN_FMjpg_QL85_.jpg
13:11 Ize's wheezle killed me
Jungle had potential, but they should have stormed earlier
He is and will always be the SECOND best potato farmer 🤍🩷🤍
lets gooooooooooooooo desert won, i liked them the most actually
Squidkid got roasted
Genshin impact players are fatherless
Lol
how do u join
I was rooting for the desert
Gosh
this is outragous 16M views but speedsilver only has 3.15M subscibers nah
I was rooting against Ize I’m ngl. I thought it was cool to have just this war king, but the zombie in the dessert made me want them to win. I also really wanted arctic to have a comeback
Bro ones names cameraman hq😂😂😂😂
f@(k u ize
desert cus i live in da desert
Where’s clown pierce when u need him
I did not expect that squidkid cameo
Boo the jungle sakes
Technoblade never dies and he will be remembered 🥔🥔🤴🏻🤴🏻

Bro what artics was so good how'd did they lose
9:08 oh ghensin impact hell yeah baby😂
i dont like starkiller, man's actually wafflin for 2h straight

thanks for respecting technoblade culture of potato
Just started watching and already don't like ize
5:51 woooo i can feel my powa!🤣
I love your vids
Hi silver I am sick I hope you are better
funny how these people don't know the story of privatefearless where my OGs at
Ize is such a loser Ong
wooooooooooooooooooooooow
I will make a genshin impact in your scoul
Man i wish Ize die early before any king selection event in future event. His power greed is making the storyline boring.
i like what you do speed silver
Jungle King was tyranical.
Ngl ize is hella annoying
W ZOMBIEEEEEEE
A theme for Ize: (Lyrics by Shyseista)   Their cries fill the air, music to your ears. Dust spreads everywhere. Why did you come here?  With a glare so sharp, paralyzing; Cuts deeper than any knife. Empty homes had left you giggling. You've come to wish them goodnight. With a grin so wide, tantalizing.. Just as empty as your heart. Seeing people quickly scampering... Were you this way at the start?  With only one awful goal to reach, you gleefully slash away Every single hope and every dream. Watch their happiness decay. Always having some heroic speech, you don't hesitate to kill. Not at all do you care what they preach. Persist and do what you will.  Broken echos, broken echos all around Fading echos, fading echos, not a sound... Oh not a soul to be found.
Lol the comment section is 80% Ize and 20% actually nice comments. (Btw pleeeeaseee do another one of these without ize)
First person name i saw an knew was xnestrio😂
2:23 RIP Potato goat
that insult on I’m a squid kid relating to the potato war was dirty
Starkiller was the better leader
The three players dying to the ender man is tragic LOLLL
I love it when Ize lose. It makes more satisfying to see everything he has done was for nothing and shows how weak he truly is
Mario music 😂
People who rooted for desert 👇
How come jungle always looses
bro did squid kid DIRTY, that hilarious. Wish i saw technos reaction to this. it would've probably been something like "ya that right".
Me : lets wach speedsilver 100 players My freind : bet 10 pounds ize is in it  Me thats not fair he is in evry one  My freind fine but i bet 10 pounds he loses but  Me well i think they kill ize straigt away and then play Freind true he is op but will never win rushing people

3:52
sliver i’m not sure what o7 meant in that sever but where i am o7 is a huge violence gang
This is not my opinion, but it should be everyone's, but the arctic kingdom should be in first place and jungle 2nd, and desert 3rd.
Bro be using genshin impact music
SAUP
How to lose: Elect Ize
Ize is really annoying
"okay ready, a 1, a 2, a 1 2 3 rockin around" 😭😭😭😭😭
I like desert kingdom ❤
There are helping together  but
22:53 nun uh
you copy ahter youtuber idea
W TECHNO REFERENCE!!!! Best potato farmer forever
i like squid kid vibe😂
I think the size guy or whoever beefs with star killer in like every video is a sweaty try hard like bro is mad annoying..
2:28 SQUID KID????? LMAO EVEN SPEEDSILVER RECOGNISES TECHNO AS A BETTER POTATO FARMER RIPP o7
If starkiller is alive then jungle will win
I knew that when I saw the community and equality of the Desert, they would win.  With a good ending of their lost zommate killing their last enemy
SILVER HIT 3 MILLION
It’s kinda funny how he says “assassinated” when referring to the cow. 😅
😮
sit back and relax grab some food mmmm grab some popcorn and a pepsi and a cocke
Ngl this dude is underrated
Luv u silverrrr ☺️
Oh man, it’s so satisfying to see a ruthless Minecraft dictatorship fall. I absolutely love these kind of videos!
Suep was stupid for trying to save Ize 🤡
rip jusngle
35:49 lmao
12:31 I’m sorry he passed up a fire aspect 1 sword?! Tffffff
Very good video
Arctic should have been in first
love ur vids
“Second best potato farmer”
ize and saitama when starkiller exists: disgustang!
speed is kinda too baised...
my opinion artic is the best and 2nd jungle 3rd sand
Ize probably was right about being more skilled, however he was an awful leader, the issue is he thinks everyone will think exactly how he does, which is the opposite of what a leader should be
27:04 there both the same thing😂 anyway bro this was an absolute w video
Ize is just the worst ban him next time
Poor starkiller, 07 bro was just passive, unfortunately he was too charismatic for his own good 😢
Ize is literally the worst. And so annoying. I wish he would shut up.
If you see this comment... that's cool😂
Good series but something I’ve noticed is that in almost every single vid u make, ize is always doing the exact same thing over and over again
aw man i wanted the artic to win
damn ize brought his people to ruin!
DESERT I VOTED FOT DESERT
I love how you said seconde best cause techno is first
ize is so self centered person being so corrupt or what
Its not genshin impact. its called Gigachad impact
Ohh genshin impact helk yeah baby😂😂
Desert
If ur seeing this u pressed newest
Ize actually sounds like the most annoying person ever
I like dingle and quad and neon and you
8:10 Bro thought he was Leroy Jenkins
Jungle
"you've been here talking them up you're jim jones" 😂
i was for jungle
Ize is the worst leader ever i dont care what people say hes horrible
1:06 desserts
Ize is my fav
How long do these video usually take also I am new subscriber and I am loving the content <3
used to like ize but now he is a b!tch when it comes to leadership be all mad because of starkiller and there always on the same team silver put them on different team or if ize does this again you should banish him for  mc days each time he does it again
2:23 your words almost summoned the best Minecraft player in history
I love the jungle's thirst for blood
102 players not 100😂
artic is the best and most holesome Civilization ever  (edit) WHY WAS IZE KING AND NOT STAR STARKILLER WAS SO NICE IZE WAS MEAN HE SAID WE GOING TO BETRAY!  (edit) ize haters here 👇
Speedsilver did u forgot the island 100 days vid???😢 if possible post it again if u died Plzzzz
But desert we’re camping
Jungle shoulda won
Really love your vids but whenever ize is in them it's kinda hard to watch ngl
Ize is pretty annoying in every Video i saw him so far xD
Ice
good videos btw
i like how he  like now win .how do i win. u kill all the 11 off them. Oh sounds easy enough  39:34
Desert
I’m subscribed
I wanted jungle to win tell that cocky guy in diamond showed up
Lots of people hate on ize but im gonna say in his defence that it definitely makes the kingdoms more dramatic and entertaining for me :)
Its always the artic whos the most fun
Man i love Ize
Squid...
פ
2:23 RIP 🐷👑
Good video ❤
Almost 3mil
Artic should have been first bro they put more details and work if anything desert should’ve been last they didn’t even try to build their houses neat
Techno is the best potato farmer
Poor starkiller always getting assassinated
"The best potato farmer"remembers technoblade😢"sorry I read that wrong the second best potato farmer." Hes a true on
ize is so unbearable, if you manage to see passed his insufferable accent, he cant seem to comprehend the fact that you cant win alone, assassinating your own team if just increasing ur chance of loosing
He never disappoints us
hello
You really had to diss, squid kid like that didn’t you?
Ize is such a bastard
Ize was a mad man
JUNGLE
Jungle king is topical dictator. I was hoping for jungle to win but more to death of jungle king
I love it when u participate in event u think u can try play in events?
OH NO SQUID KID I FEEL BAD FOR YOU MAN but it is true technoblade is better then you in farming potato TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
Usually I don’t like suep but he’s such a cruel and cool character
34:55 That’s what you get! Your leader literally destroyed a whole civilization proving himself a good leader, and btw gave you enchants and then you ditch first chance you get
Artic is the best community
"wafflin like jim jones" lmao i love ize m8
I like that players like Ize, not matter what channel I'm watching civilization videos on, always make the same exact mistakes and never learn, lol.  Antagonist: "Hey guys, we need to all armor up, or you're stupid and I'm going to throw a tantrum." Everyone: "OK, why do we need armor?" Antagonist: "Because there's going to be a fight!" Everyone: "Why is there going to be a fight?!" Antagonist: "Because I'm going to start one!"  Terrible leadership, lmao, your skills in one singular facet of a situation don't make you qualified to be in charge of every other facet.
bro ROASTED squid kid
Star killer has changed so much threw the months
I don’t know if Ize is playing a character or not, but if I was in the jungle…I’d be moving, consequences be damned, I’m not fallowing that war-monger
this is the second time ive seen Starkiller get assassinated. (The first I saw was the medieval civilization)  I wonder if StarKiller has ever been able to be king? And if he had been able to be crowned king, would they have a better chance of survival. Just a curious thought.
Can you make a video about chickens
yea second best techno was the best rip
Chungledor sounds like Thor fr
10:30 what music is this
Ngl every single one of the videos I see ize in I hate him more and more. He seems like a really rude and just can't take it easy and enjoy the fun of the challenge without tryharding his way to victory.
He absolutely violated squid kid.
Bro Isengard is spoiled in real life
21:24  😂😂😂😂😂😂 bro I love the squid dude he hilarious
this is so good
Ize and jungle on top
Squid kid techno would be coming after   .. You😢😢😢
whoever killed squid kid needs to die irl
&#$* ize
Nothing: Silver at 19:21  MONKE
bro the zombie warrier- he didnt even lose hope even when he turned into a zombie-
ize was so annoying in this one, it’s like minecraft is all he has 😂
Dude the jungle king was so god damn an stupid motherfu&*%!
How do I join stuff like this
That ize guy is annoying
FOrtnite
That one dude who sacrificed himself to stop a creeper... I respect him. 4:56
Ive seen a couple videos with Ize now and im starting to come to the conclusion that hes kind of a prick.
Ize is so STUPID TO DO THIS 😭
Better storytelling and writing than most movies
Sbeed  Silwer I want to join 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I was rooting for Arctic bcz sUeP was a great warrior/leader; carried on with 5 troops.
If I saw Ize spawn on my team, I'd try to kill him in a trap before he has time to inevitably kill our leader, split us up into factions, or bitch us out and defect. He's an active hinderance to his own team every single time. If he's being asked to play the antagonist, he could at least have fun with it like CommonHat. As a villain he's just not fun to watch.
0:09 I LOVE THE PART WHEN TECHNOBLADE JOINED YIPPEE
Bro if Starkiller was King they wouldve won honestly
30:24 oh the lag 😐😐 ig it was the lag that got them lmfao
25:06 Nooo Infernally
Why is it always the Jungle that breaks into Chaos xD
can u do a battle rayle again plsssss
I feel so bad for starkiller every video silver has he dies
Honesty jungle kingdom was not bad but the other 2 were waay betta
well done silver you outdid it again you have epic videos never get boring you  really deserve to get over 10 million subs
I’m big FANNNN
It’s ize again
I've is the worst leader every bro
Technoblade is the best potato farmer R.I.P Technoblade
Ize what a weird man
that jungle king is good but is not a team leader and des whats best for him
Ize is that one disney villain who thinks too insentive about himself and thinks about power over peace.
Bro HAD to violate squid kid like that🥶🥶🥶🔥
Ize just makes this worst like all he does is start controversy
Dudeare you kidding me? That video was awesome! Greta job for your first civilization video!
I beleive you can get a least 1 b subscribers in a year
your killin' it
and
The ones I like most is the ones you work hard on
You always make my day
We love you silver!!!!!
Zombie MVP
2:17 Even silver is making fun of squid cuz he lost potato war😂
Watching soup betray the desert and dying by them was so satisfying
I love how the zombie help his teams🤣❤️🔥🔥
ize always tryna be the bad guy
A
Ize ruined the fun and he is the worst
That ize guy suuuuuuucks. People like him ruin online games for me.
Ize is the worst person ever, I'd hate to play Minecraft with him
The server can be pilates on bedrock?
The Desert's Zombie was literally fighting the King of The Jungle and Ize running away in fear and taking damage had me dying of laughter 😂😂
Jesus Christ is savior amen 🙏
Ize is soooo toxic I hate it
Ize literally lost half of his army, going to the jungle, and killing them himself then, relied on attacking first to win which is not a good idea when there is a whole other team left.  Never accept someone who says they should be the leader just because they are the best without any prior sucess to show these people are just full of arrogant, and will most definetly blame their lack of foresight on others.
Attic kingdom was so nice and wholesome and then you dropped a ravager on them :/
Sliver did not care when the arti people died and it was very unfair
Ize = maximum toxicity. Remember people like that. They show up in every sphere, demanding respect and trying to brute force it rather than earning it. It's a good example of a very toxic personality you'll encounter.
That zombie was so usefull huh 😂
yo Palikka was in this?
I’m happy the kid who tried to defect from jungle got instant killed by arctic lmaooo
ize is such a nerd
Ize is so annoying
Star killer should’ve been king
Is it just me or is Ize a big baby in every event he plays in
why the music mario theme lol
Sometimes im annoyed at ize, he always became the king through his power but not because people want to. Its kind of annoying and I feel like star deserves to be atleast once to be a king.
ITS SQUIDKID
I will always root against ize.  “What does starkiller have that I don’t ?”  A likeable personality was the answer .
I think eyes is the worst
whats the audio you used filming this video speedsilver would love it if you told me . thanks !
I love your videos your my favorite YouTuber
W abstract zombie
Ize carried
keep up your awsome content
arctic builds 🔛🔝
Nah he did squid dirty
Yea sorry my iPhone has 0.00000000001 Giga bites of space so theres no way ill have space for a 17 Gb game 😅💀
"Starkiller wouldn't have died."
the irish guy got on my last nerve
What 00.00
“
IZE is awful lol every team his on loses cause he sucks as a leader.
what I dont get is that why didnt they give ize the crown and let starkiller be leader?
You make these too easy... let them discover shit naturally
Ize is toxic AF, he never lets people play always wants to be the leader and foil everyone who is trying to play the game their way. Also he fucking talks to everyone like shit, in real life he would get smacked
The problem was IZE not realizing that gathering diamond armor for all his team would have been more forth coming which I believed Star would have suggested but his to narrow minded
Arctic should've won😠
Im happy jungle dyed but i was on team THE BİGGEST GOAT ARTİCT
Why we all hating on ize he was better than starkiller
Bro for no reason at all I vote for anyone BUT ize. he's so angry at everyone at first for not thinking he's worthy of the crown. If you like idk.. spent TIME with the players and congratulate them like starkiller, they wouldn't boycott and Ize wouldn't have to threaten them with death. It also annoys me on how he always talks over people. Like, LET THEM SAY WHAT THEY HAVE TO?
Ize is like the Hitler of civilizations.
I knew suep was isaacs friend when he killed that jungle guy for talking shit on his leader
35:50. *gosh* 😮
33:27. Not me thinking it was the skeleton 😅
I knew it was Isaac mining! It’s that voice - *he was just a baba in a pram* *hes wafflin* 😂 *talking em up like ur Jim jones* 🤣 28:44 *say it wichur chest* 👏🏼
Inevitably being killed by a creeper 😆 5:00
It was sad to see Ize go, but it was an epic story.
The guy that died in the jungle he protected his teammates from a creeper
6:48 wtf😭😭 it's not some silly little genocide u can just put in ur minecraft vid
Unlike most civilization videos where the main antagonist is not usually a villain, Ize is truly a villain lmao sucks how he never truly changed in other videos
ize is literally so annoying
I honestly cannot stand that ize guy. Every video he is in he is a total douche. You are supposed to be in a civilization. Share the wealth. Help your fellow man. You become a leader by being humble, generous, understanding, smart, and ruthless only when you have to be. Not by hogging all the good loot for yourself and backstabbing people. That is how civilization turns on you.
I love that during the arctic invasion the jungle players killed the among us
I hate it Ize
Ize is annoying asf
Ize is a dbag
Is no one gonna tell me silver is always blamed for who is last place lol
:0
God Bless
Palms 23
Spread The Gospel
silver i love ur skin so much i risked my pc downloading it LOL
Ize sucks really starkiller and ize are on the same team he is a good leader but ize is selfish and usually plan to kill him when ize on his team you know who is going to die plus he stacks himself so he Is able to kill anybody against him and it just suck Star killer deserved more.
“Caught off guard by a creeper” *died to a phantom*
Dwarves had the biggest comeback of all time
Jungle
war
Tell me these are sorta scrpited without telling me. Ize and satama are ALWAYS TEAMING UP. Ize ALWAYS wants to be the leader because hes "stronger and more geared" yet someone can easly beat him by fighting better then him
Ize has the leadership abilities of a CoD squeaker screaming "Rush B" until players relent so he will be quiet
Ize is a crap leader
Awful leader
Can you get in to these events on bedrock edition?
23:56  he kinda bitch
But then again, it might be too overpowered because you’re on their team
What you should do silver is next time does a civilization video. Then you should have one admin on each team and see who wins.
The dessert and the jungle king go "DESTROY THE WEAK!"
Loved artic sm
bro this video reminds me of ww2, german- oh sorry, "jungle" was controlled by 1 guy named ize who failed art class.. atacked sovie-  no no, arctic, and slayed them.. then amerima, ehm ehm, desert, helped them and lost                                                -👴
19:50 how was jungle last.
Ize set his charisma stat to -2. lol he had all the tools to win over the people and absolutely shat the bed
Ize is a terrible leader starkiller would've been a much better leader. Only have fun when you're winning? sooooo lame : /
Hey can I pls go in one of your events
Silver you got an amazing narrating skill that keeps us engaged and you use just the right amount of players making it fun.  I would love to get in one of your events or push some scenarios to you.  Thanks
Yeah... I think when playing the bad guy you have to have levels and remember to have redeeming qualities, otherwise, your just a loud annoying  dude who people want dead... Instead of a cool villain, you don't know whether to root for or not. Plus, I bet they are in future videos and the meta of not trusting them would be high lol
I adore ur vids!! <3
Imagine playing genshin impact
ize is a jerk i dont like him in any video hes in
Ize is such an hatable and predictable character
The arctic base was the best
Make more civilisation videos
Ize is getting cocky from past event and even more annoying that ever just saying
Brother I really don't understand how in all of these videos Ize is always "elected" to be the leader when he's nothing but an arrogant bully
Your def paid those mfs to say they like genshin cuz no one does💀
Mario music in background
If I had a nickle for every time Starkiller had been killed for being a genuinly good leader and person...
Omg, These people have learned NOTHING!!! 💀🤦🏻 *EVERY. SINGLE. **_GODDAMN TIME._* you let Ize lead a team, it loses. STOP FALLING FOR IT! 🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
The actions taken by Ize in this challenge sows how terrible of a leader he is. Like when they lost 3 to 4 people leaving during the blood moon. They also as usual lost.
My freind is a genshin nerd
Bro why did you have to make an among us statue the Arctic clan
Team jungle
Anyone else think Ize is just kinda a dick? Like it’s not the betraying or power grabbing that’s part of the game. He’s just so fucking needlessly rude and mean to everyone especially kids on the server and he acts like anyone who questions him as if it’s a personal attack. Dude needs therapy.
Squid kid the second best potato farmer because of technoblade that's funny 😂  😅😢rip technoblade
What a legend for using the super Mario bros biome music
MY FRIEND WAS IN THE JUNGLE NATION HE WAS THE SHREK
Bro a soon as I saw genshin impact I switched vids
Ize sucks. Ruined something fun.
Please let me join a civilisation sliver I’m a good bulider
I've makes me so angry
in my opinion, the winter village and the susmas tree with the sus statue and the sus spirits of the people are number 1
"it did make some good content"
i would love to be in i vid like this is there any why i can join one?
I WATCHED ALL OF THEM MAN ... THANKS
Just when I thought the video was getting good🤦‍♂️ 2:54
so basically 3d terraria
Dude that Eyes guy SUCKS…… I can’t stand him shitty personality
Lmao second best potato farmer love it!!!!
I just saw technoblade join in it xd
i  love your videos you get a sub
I immediately subscribed!
specificly (is that how you spell it?)
Your civilization videos
Silver I love your videos keep making them!
Nice
I salute all of the desert players, and specifically the Desert King 🫡
This is as fake as a mobile ad.
I love Arctic solely because of their vibes ngl
Ize was mad at starkiller for acting like he owns everything when Ize tried to do the same thing, but starkiller was with the team way longer land actually did something.  Ize was talking all that "your gonna get 2 hit I'm full diamond" where was that when the other teams started jumping you and the team you forced to vote for didn't trust you. Fear doesn't always work
i hate ize for killing starlight everytime, starlight is the best
I watch a lot of your civilisation vids and ize always kills StarKiller and StarKiller has a very good perspective and mentality but Ize ruins everything man please stop
I DISLIKED BECAUSE OF IZES AUDACITY
I lived that artic team coz they are literally so funny and they made this video most entertaining
My first 3 civilisation videos. 1. Magic gum 2. Ish 3. Speed Silver 🤩
Bro did Squidkid dirty 💀 Btw techno blade never dies. I guess now Squidkid:(    No hate. LoVED THE VIDOE AND sQUIDKID
Every time I think that there will be a option for peace in one of these experiments I was wrong I do not want to see a last team standing challenge I want social experiment to see what man does with no rules to see them rise and fall on their own  I wish that. This is the future for these civilizations experiments but that’s just a wish and not all wishes are granted
JackTBC: “I got this, I think I got this, maybe I got this”
Artic shoud half won
i really like the arctic's build but overall i really liked the jungle kingdom
16:10 This is why the irish had to be oppressed  They’re relentless & need to be tamed
desert
Ize sounds like such an annoying person to be around
genshin impact🤯
For supply drops, wouldn't it be better to support the weaker nations more?
I think the attic was the best
bad ending
arctic was my favourite. i cried when it fell
Hi
anyone else who thinks Ize kinda sounds and acts like that guy from got?
25:05 Silver: 1 player was cought of guard and killed by a creeper   The phantom that killed him:  ;-;
the jungle king pisses me off
cELWsGTqCDA
b6vrp3nhgke
Ize is hella annoying in all of these.
no
whats with the barier blocks
To everyone there is 33 people in every one
I absolutely hate ize and saitama they are crybabies dictators in both videos But I enjoy this videos good job dude
Go silver!!!
Isn't it interesting? The most selfish, cocky, and conniving emerge as advantaged!
"Best potato farmer" "Oh wait I read that wrong, 2nd best potato farmer"  We'll never forget him😢
3:57 skip the sponsor
is there a video on whole internet where all civilizations did alliance?
Bro the jungle is like the german in ww2 fr
Desert deserved the win. Ize's downfall is a good showcase of the dangers of fascism.
That zombie is a veteran
Desert
He brought squid kid
Arctic definitely had the best actual civilization town and desert number two.
Its always Ize vs StarKiller
jungle!!!!!!!!!
Fun !’b
They always kill star killer 💀
what was the music in the background around 1:45? its so familiar
Ize is just like a Karen 😂😂
Jungle ruler is making me mad ong
who does ize think he is
Bruh who the hell let saitama in 😭
I love how all these comments are dogging Ize, it brings me joy 😂 (like actually does. I strongly don't like Ize)
0:09 when i see Technoblade nick idk how but i almost cry, RIP
The fact than xNestorio join the event😀
Y’know I gotta say Ize is a pretty underrated villain, if he’s just putting on a show then my hat is off to him
2:21 ah yes the second best the one and only techno blade is the best
To be honest. Ize had an amazing character. Being the ultimate Villain to this story and almost winning with his civilization but in the end fails to do so. And I also thought that they could still win if starkiller wasn't killed. Ize could still be crowned as the king. And starkiller as his Right hand man would be good. But Ize underestimated StarKillers leadership ability. Honestly In most Civilization videos Ive seen. Starkiller was either betrayed or killed and thats just sad.
ize is toxic
Jungle
i'm sorry but the words "king" and "election" don't go in the same phrase.
I liked the desert kingdom
does anybody realise that the intro is all supermario bros like for the desert biome he used the desert background song in mario bros
What an amazing video
this is by far one of the best videos ive seen on youtube
This content is amazing! Please make more!
I love how the Jungle’s downfall was that they were too confident in their abilities, had their lower part of their army stayed with the king they may have won
I dont have genshin but i have 2 MILLION POWER ON WARPATH.
I like the desert
If they stayed eating carrots they would have won
EYEs feels like alexander the great to me
Finally, politics in minecraft
I hate that cocky Irish guy
He made a rash decision attacking without a proper back up plan
They should've voted starkiller instead the one thing that he had that is stronger than ize's military power was love for his citizens
How come greed is in every Minecraft survival worlds
I was kinda hoping for the winter Kingdom to win
Bro 14:31 these guys were getting along wholesomely (that might not be a word)
I liked the Arctic kingdom the most they ever more peaceful then the rest in my eyes and funny to
I HATE IZE BOOOO
How u can make a fallibg chest
Just a thought, don’t know whether these are scripted (but fun to watch anyway)  If the civilisations were smart, they could’ve just had a “leader” AND a king. King doesn’t necessarily mean the leader, it just translates to an extremely powerful player. You could have someone who’s really good at leading (aka organising) as the real leader to make sure the group doesn’t fall apart and everyone knows what they’re doing, while the king, being the best at pvp and game sense (and/or having the best gear), being like a ‘general’ in charge of combat decisions
Personally, I think there’s a right way, and a wrong way to be an antagonistic player.   I’ve seen many other lets plays, and even experiments, that’ve had antagonistic players, and/or trolls, that I greatly enjoyed. They never took things too far, while still playing their role as antagonists.   This came off as mean spirited, and honestly a lot of the players seemed to be unhappy about this. It really seemed to ruin the fun for most of them.   It personally made me dislike the video, as it got extremely annoying. Like a rotten boss at your job that makes your life miserable.   I personally find it much more enjoyable to watch players having fun, and working together through hardships. Even if there’s a civil war, or conflict, it’s not usually 1 player forcing others into it. Watching people *willingly* create chaos together is just much more enjoyable.
Looking back at this video I didn't realize at first but there was a *Technoblade* reference at 2:20 where Silver says "Lead by the best potato farmer, wait... I read that wrong, the second best potato farmer". If you guys don't get the reference basically Technoblade spent months trying to overcome im_a_squid_kid on the leaderboards for most potatos farmed. Technoblade was a legend amongst Minecraft players since the beginning. I can't believe squid kid was in this video anyways just wanted to put it out there.
I love this
I loved the jungle😢
SiLVER I LOVE YOU and STAR KILLER
That zombie is the real content 😂
Hey why is artic on third place artic is my favorite
nah bro Starkiller playing peacefully but every civilazation Starkiller always get assassinated
14:52 I saw among us!!
The zombie!! Oh the foreshadowing!!!
the desert zombie carried the war
Keep  up the good content
some of the music is from a mario game i played on Wii U
I am squid kid is sad
omg imagine dyiong and last words you hear is "have you heard of Genshin Impact?".
The person who was boating that zombie , i respect you so much lol
This guy does better events than mr beast does. I mean rules and settings are amazing and chris isn't destrubing.

I love ur vids though
Genshin sucks, literally just a copy of breath of the wild
Ize is my fav
Ize is so annoying I can just imagine him being a rich kid who always gets his way in real life sounds like he would cry about everything😭😂
I just realized Invictable and suep were in this event
Bro rating desert by adding Indian theme song at background
Rip technoblade
I love Genshin impact
Idk why
This video makes me want cookies
In my eyes the jungle were the best region they were so brave
2:21 sigma silver rip techno
LETS GOOOO JUNGLE LOST
Arctic I feel they were going to be the best of them all
I know this video are scripted but I hate how they make ize ruin everything about these videos
LMAOOO who killed the among us statue 😭😭
Was that a reference to techno
I thought that jungle were stupid FP attacing it was good BUT stratigegly it was stupid ass fu#k
We all don't like IZE.
Bro really said second beat potato farmer squid kid
Cool😎
I love the one selfless player who saw the creeper and pushed it and walked into it to stop it
Wow
Mvp was the zombie guy , even after death he put in the work 😂
"Uhh I'm gonna elect myself as king sound good?" "...no" Best quote
i knew the desert kingdom would win!
anyone saw transitiom at22.40
Izz and Saitama always gotta be diff
Jungle’s king was so annoying and cocky it was painful to watch lol
dang it I really wanted the Arctic team to win 😢
16:48 dammnnn
That dude ize defects all the time and still loses 😂
Rest in peace legend technoblade
“You’re Wafflin”
I am so sick of people like Ize and Saitama who think they're the main character just because they selfishly mined for the entire beginning of these events. They are entirely predictable and make things boring when they inevitably ruin their own civilization with their shitty leadership and constant assassination plots on people who are actually doing good.
Jungle🎉🎉🎉😎😎😎😎😎🥳🥳🥳🫡
its always starkiller man poor guy
Zombie bro mvp
i like the snowey kingdom the best
From what I’ve learnt from these videos is that the last person to attack wins whoever wants the bloodshed will get killed first  Also ize is kinda toxic lmao it’s mine craft take a break 😂
"Second best potato farmer, sorry." Not sorry, squid kid.
it wasn’t fair from the start the dwarves are tiny and probably rlly difficult to hit while the giants are huge and rlly easy to hit and same with the elves who are normal size but still rlly ez to hit for the dwarves
I notice I never see players with horses in these events, like for when the artic was being invaded by the jungle, players who weren’t fast enough were picked off but if they had horse, they could’ve probably successfully retreated with no casualties.
luckly he recorrected the best poatato farmer
Thank you for correcting yourself when you called squid kid the best potato farmer to the 2nd. The best potato farmer title belongs to a certain legend.
ize and his people are always like this I swear, "I got you all diamonds and enchantments" or "your only iron you're easy to be 2 tapped" he never actually leads though, its just war with him, he never works with people at the start n shit its so annoying
That   skull  looks  like   squidward  is  home
i voted for desert
Ok
Whoever’s voting in these civ town competitions is on crack.
Honestly... Who cares about getting two hit!   I now these videos need drama but that really annoyed me.   No offense Ize but get a life.
)this stuff was great! please keep it on *)
Jungle king was honestly a minecrsft napoleon
I liked Artic
Bro ize is like the most stupid person there
Honestly wish Ize wasn’t allowed at this point. Anytime he’s involved it’s so beyond predictable not to mention that he was just kind of a Dick to people this time around
He deserves 1 billion subscribers
When he saw squid kid he said the 2nd best because technoblade is 1st
Im_a_squid_kid must be thinking something like "go f yourself, speedsilver!"
hello! here to talk about genshin, since 75% of the replies on the pinned comment are seriously delusional.  1: the community is not as bad as people make it out to be. you take one look at twitter and decide "yeah, this is the entire fandom!!!" twitter is literally THE HIVE of weirdos. a lot of the people that post NSFW of minors in the game, or just the characters in general, arent even fans of the game, and are just using the characters because they have a slight anime style to them. and about the racists and proshippers, nope, 70% of them are bait and are trying to make the community look worse than it is in reality. open your eyes.  2: "its a copy of BOTW!" fun fact, it really isnt. its easy to assume, considering a lot of the game mechanics have the same system, but genshin did get permission from the creators of BOTW to quote unquote "copy" them.  3: the company being "racist". im not going to deny, the company is very colorist. but, there are plenty of problematic companies out there, but thats not gonna stop anyone from enjoying a game. people saying that the game doesnt have a lot of diversity in skin color are correct, but its a fantasy game. its not supposed to be all about cluture and skin colors. EDIT: the game does actually have a lot of cultural aspects, such as weapon designs, character clothing, scenery, etc. you just dont pay attention to it and think that representation is only about skin color.  4: the unrealistic beauty standards. you may have noticed that most women in the game have body features that you may not like that much, but like... thats just what women look like. are you just gonna get mad because they have slightly bigger tits than avarage??? thats dumb. honorable mention! the reason to why none of them are chubby, is pretty obvious. you can see clearly in game that the characters move around a lot, so obviously theyre gonna lose weight.  5: the "boring" gameplay. its not a game for everyone, i can agree with that 100%. but a lot of people dont even give valid reasons to why they think the game is boring. some people play for like 2 minutes and then complain that theres nothing to do. well yeah??? you just started. what do you expect? the playstyle and exploration mechanisms are very fun once you start to understand them more, you just dont give the game a chance to actually show any of the mechanics.  thank you for coming to my ted talk. if you have any further questions or complants, im more than happy to explain to you.
Ize is fucking insufferable oh my god how do people put up with that
❤🎉
ice: worst leader of all time.
You should do more civilization content cause you got my sub
I wish Jungle won
ngl Ize toxic bad communicator and always looses
So i have realized that these videos are staged and ize never wins unsubscribing and disliking
To be honest ize sounds like a bich boy
When I saw the squid kid for first time just gave me back flashes of techno blade 😢
W Ize fr though!
Aradir be like:
Is it just me, or does ize suck
Ize was the worst player in this, I get that its strategy but he literally weakened his own team and was just ruining it for people.
Hey guys, remember wisp?
ize actually suceeded 70% he wiped out The Strongest Nation (ice) and killed 5-6 desert people before desert decided to 2 nations v 1 nation
Nahhh ize always get everyone to follow him,it's sad that he became the king😢
I dislike ize😅
Izes is sooo greedy and careless I hate him
ice
I really wish ize got killed when he threatened his own team  such a jack@$$
dont invite eyez into these events he is a litteral tyrant
bruh Ize is soooooooooooooo annoying give star a chance mabye if he does ize will actually do shit for the team
more!!
High key ur great at editing these videos, I’m way past my Minecraft glory days and still find this stuff highly entertaining. You’ve found your niche and you’re good at it man. Take pride.
Bro Ize is horrible Lmao bro did a cue and then lost all his troops, Star is way better and prob would of won
Can you actually put starkiller on a different team than size because everytime they are on the same team,starkiller seems to either die or is not leader
Not a fan of Ize, he is a real jerk and dictator. He is getting clapped if I see him at an event.
Poop
The editing for this video hit’s harder than My mum
Did I just watch game of thrones?
the second best potato farmer squid kid rip technoblade 😢
Broo, squid kid appears, love you and technoblade won
racist it is Aztec Warriors
So good video
Ize villian lore
Ize's death makes me happy.
Ban ize and saitama
Arctic on top
I like the part were the desert zombie team up with the deserts!!!
thanks for making these videos i will get my friends tosub and like
Ize is consistently a scumbag in every civilization, but it's good content I guess
Respect to Jungle ❤
jungle jungle why
I want jungle to win
Bro why is it that every single video with ize and Saitama they team up and ruin it
Is this really ALL your story? You have a script. EVERY GOD DAMN VID. Starkiller is the people's fav, then Ize just starts to be a douchebag FOR NO REASON other than he's got a complex. You have a handfull of vids in this playlist and it's this script, EVERY VID. Just kick him.  He makes drama, which is sometimes good, yeah. But there's literally no variety anymore because the dude just backstabs people then makes the same argument every single time to get voted as leader, then loses. That's it. He always says he's the best yet the dude will lose every vid. Because he's the villain and you know he is, so he should lose. It's weird. Add some peaceful variety to this because the world events are good enough of a catalyst for conflict most of the time.
No one:  Literally no one: sUeP: never let ‘em know your next move
Genshin Impact 💀💀💀
i’m so glad ize died he was the worst ever
PUT GOD FIRST JESUS DEID ON THE CROSS FOR OUR SINS
Please make more videos
ngl the zombie was the real mvp
My fav civilization is artic
Tbh if you’re ok ize team you already know he gonna be king and your gonna have to do pvp against your will
2:20 the best now :(
ize is the most obnoxious person ive ever seen why is he in every videoive watched😭😭😭
Me waiting for my friend MA to show up 😐😐😑😑
I love pandas
So I really want to be in your videos, but I don’t have Twitter and neither of my parents will let me have it
Silver what is up can you make a civilisation  video of avatar the last air bender
ize was looking kinda sus finding those diamonds in that erratic patern of mining... and that spawner after that... *very very sus in fact*
A good king never seeks out conflict, but must always be ready for it.
It’s so hard to win these changes
How did this happened
I think the jungle is the best but i still don’t know
The fack that he said 2and best make me cry rip technoblade
❤jungle
I wanted jungle
Yes second best potato farmer o7
Loved this vid bro
Large respec for zombie
It's so satisfying seeing Ize lose
Squid kid is going down bc of techno! Let’s go techno blade never dies!
How did jungle win the vote they had the worst city
Isi should go now
I love how everyone got denied in the Arctic. "Don't be persuaded by him, he just has an accent" is something I'm gonna definitely use in the future
I'm sitting here freaking out bc I know what the song is from that starts playing at 50 seconds in but I can't say it it's on the tip of my tongue it's driving me crazy
Oh genshin impact hell yeah baby
Sooo the schtick with these videos is that Aiz just rebels no matter what and bullies the 9 year olds on his team into falling in line?
jungle all the way ize is op
I’m super sad that Arctic lost but I’m SO HAPPY IZE DIED STAR KILLZ WAS SO NICE SO yeah good job desert for making me happy again
i like how the king election always ruin the teams teamwork, it takes much more than experience to be king, like in chess the king cant protect himself
That Ize dude is what we like to call “a cancer”
star killer should be the king since ize litterally steals
Anyone else really hate Ize and his group? He's so, like, hypocritical. "He keeps shouting over others" he said, WHEN HE WAS LITERALLY DOING THAT.  Then his crew killed Starkiller EVN THOUGH there was no point, seeing as king has already been picked. And his ego is just... abusrd.
Ize haters be crying bro, he gave us a great video
ize sucks the fun out of everything
Hi!!!!!
This was my introduction to Ize. Didn't like him much. Seeing him in other events... he has his uses. One can work with him.
The fact that sUep help Ize was suprising I thought that Ize would have won the game I was sad when the jungle lost
i like how the zombie seemed to apreciate the fact they brought him back to the deset kingdom and helped them in the battle lol
25:08 creeper... Lmao. I'm jk the vid Was awesome and I enjoyed it very much. Keep making these type of videos! Godly content
Izes is the worst King ever!
ize is so hard to listen to
0:10 Technoblode(seriously tho)
Hi, I just wanted to ask if I could get the mod for the crown
great vid!
ize: o shit star died, anyways
Bruh i hate that guy ize_ he say like hes the one in charge of everything why dont he provide everything like food materials and other
21:06 😂
L IZE L IZE L IZE L IZE L IZE L IZE
"dude you're gonna get 2 hit" Proceeds to flee from a zombie whilst crying for help.
Ize is a fun character.
This is fake when the guy with the face came died, it said respawn, and when the artic at some point dropped down to 7 players when he cut, they all of sudden had 14.
it's basically consensus now that ize is no good as a leader. he's like a prime example of corruption in power
"Best Potato Farmer" squidkid #2 Technoblade #1 BABY
Star killer was the best of the jungle
You need to ban this Ize guy, he tries to overthrow everyone in every video, he thinks he's the main character and he probably has Stockholm syndrome
So happy ize and Suep were slain, couldn’t be happier 😂
I love how Ize thinks he’s the best just because he’s mediocre at PVP and has debris covering his body
Real months
people hate on ize but he's that only thing that made this video interesting
"do you know how to combo" bro what ur still getting 2 hit that does nothing
Ngl I dont think Ize deserves all the hate, i actually enjoy watching him
Can’t stand ize tbh like the series and all but that guy thinks he’s everything,does this every episode
2:13 cought in 4k ultra
In my opinion, Ize seamed like kind of a d*ck
Sadly technos account doesn’t produce potato’s anymore because no one logs onto the account anymore so he won’t be number 1 forever but in or hearts he will be forever
Techno blade still lives against squid kid for all time in the one and only potato wars
Artic
I have yet to see a single one of these where the team Ize is on managed to win.
gg's for abstract
21:18 yes, everything is content on YouTube
i think people like genshin cause of raidens booba blade lol
i regret stop playing genshin bc no i play val and i use too much disk space and i use a laptop :(
I'm not sure if Ize is acting or not but he is just toxic like why would you need to force everyone just have fun it's not always about winning like jeez
ize got humbled but i like his drive ngl
I dislike Ize
My humor now consists of grown ups saying amongus and kids saying genshin impact
IZE had good strategy and leadership. It was smart to take over the crown by force and invade early. We saw that most jungle players were sissies who were too scared to invade/leave their island.
rip tecnoblade
arctic should've gotten 1st place with the base building desert second and jungle last!
This was awesome
Ize is by far the worst player in this video
I was rooting for artic i though they had the most beutiful base
Naruto Fans: Blood Moon More Like Infinite Tsukoyomi
23:15 the panda did a flip
i really hate ize
my favourite is Ize i dont care if u liked starkiller it would be a boring video if Ize wasnt leader Starkiller sucked
this did not age well
Kachaw
Does Ize's voice shit anyone else as much as it shits me? It's like a cross between a whinging kid and drowning cat.
Artic is the best bro
Jungle is my favorite
Ize is the worst out of them tbh no offense  also why u hate star so much ?
Squidkid is the one who did potato wars with technoblade
Even though Ize is a little annoying, you have to commend his abilities to rally forces and maintain power like a powerful leader. Hes always fun to watch lmao
2 unskippable ads every 7-9 Minutes 💀
I love the jungle civilization
Litteraly every speedsilver civilisation video:   Ize’s team: the team that attacks an other team   Team 2: the team that gets attacked and losses 2/3 of their teammates  Team 3: the team that slowly gets stronger and stronger till they fight and wins  And team 2 also combines with team 3 at the end
Starkiller98 doing a great job as a politician by faking his whole personality to get votes accurate politician strat
I wanted the jungle kingdom to win
I HATE IZE FOR KILLING STAR😡
Speedsilver:"led by the best potato farmer" Technoblade staring at him from heaven Speedsilver:"wait I red that wrong 😬"
i luv this vid artic was a peaceful nation then jungle was turned to dictatership
L jungle and arctic
Almost cried when he said 2nd best potato farmer... TECHNO NEVER DIES
ize reminds me of stalin
Dangggg he called out squid kid
All hail desert kingdom
2:22-2:27:technoblade's legacy never dies 😂👍
Ize just sounds like a dick rather lose than give him what he wants cause he cried about it
Techno blade is the best potato farmer not squidy poo
i know im one year late butt i loved the snow kingdom it was all bc their base like- a christmas tree and a ice ring- and like just wow- ize was my enemy… rip star u will be remembered…
speedsilver: so lead by the best potato farmer wait i read that wrong the second best potato farmer. squid kid be like: dude why you gotta  do me like that🤣.
Squidkid pov: Bruh no need to rub it in
Oh looks it’s the Nile valley civilisation
Everyone was hating on ize, but honestly, he was by far my favorite
Snow Jungle Dessert
bro ize makes my blood boil so much
what team had xnestorio
I was for arctic at the beginning but the only problem I did not like was suep
When he said I made a public server is saw the username: preatonplayz. 😱💀☠️
I like the jungle
Ize is so toxic and stupid it’s sad
I honestly wanted the jungle to win
the best- wait no the second best, squid kid 😂
Squid kid was violated
O he did squid kid dirty with the second best potato farmer  Rip blood god
I just started watching an dam great intro
Iv watch many of you videos and iv come to the conclusion ize is a horrible person  i want to join just to hunt him down ahah
ize is a W
Bro ize always ruins it for starkiller, he needs to shut up, and let someone else get thing for once
Arctic
Ize and 5aitama should not be allowed to play in these challenges anymore, they are toxic and ruin all of the fun
I loved the desert zombie
21:23 he's a cruel god
they should have made abstrekt the king after the war
Why is Ize so impatient...
IZE makes me not want to watch your content, I love the videos and I love all the content you put on YT. But IZE is so aggressive and toxic to his own team 💀
Ize ruins all the Civ videos, he’s toxic and too aggressive, he isn’t a team player. He makes me want to not watch the whole video, which is a shame because these vids are so good!
Respect for the techno reference. He shall not be forgotten.
poor panda he was just eating
Dude, if at least ize was loyal to his nation, he could team up with star and could've won that experiment. Just imagine, while star is being the good guy and making a good relationship with other factions, ize is planning how to destroy this other factions if needed. But he preferred to be dumb.
Ize is a noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooob
Ize: Naw, I found this in a dungeon dude *Shows viewers enchantment table
I'd like to see squid kid as king  He's smart and has good ideas, he'd be a good one
Nah why everyone hating on ize he is one of the best parts of the videoes
i would chose the rome sivilization i ganned 100 million power in 5 days
24:59 if u look at the bottem of the screen u can see there 0/69 player and thats funny cuz hes the winter area which has among us 😅
Wow Zombie
Genshit Impact*
Most of SpeedSilver's videos BGM really sounds like Genshin Impact, and I love it. I also wish to see more of this challenge stuff.
The world's best potato farmer no that was took by technoblade
from what i see ize is such a dic during the event
Ize is way to aggressive. They should've just killed him early one
Scripted???
See how almost every civilization/team with ize in it loses? Yeah, ize is a terrible leader. If he's on your team just kill him on the spot.
I really liked Jungle until Ize came in, no offense tho >~>
how can you join
Man it's funny everytime they disagree with ize
31:34 and 35:45  Does anyone  know what is the names of those texture packs? Really like the look
Jungle should’ve won.  Btw Idc what people say but Ize did a pretty good job ngl.
Ize is a good pvp'yer but a bad leader
Bruh how did the artic lose the build comp. They had the best base compared to the others and paid a price of three people for working hard. Now that’s unfair.
my man just used Inazuma battle theme in the debate
I kinda feel like ize would be an abusive father
SpeedSilver I am a very good fan and would like to know if you would put me in on of your events if you do please contact me but I am not on Twitter so if you have discord I could tell you mine
I guarantee Ize has no actual friends.
bro say potato farmer= technoblade
Gay Shit Infarct sucks this game is poor
these videos would be so much more entertaining without Ize
Ize's tyranny seems to work strong in the beginning, but keep getting beaten by Well organised clans with more order and less corruption, just shows that his tactics aren't the best
Use is so annoying
In my opinion i found the arctics town best and the deserts worst and the jungle mid (my opinion)
It’s unfair that the ice joined ihe desert
After watching these videos, I've learned that any team that has Ize on it, should immediately kill him. Otherwise you're just gonna have teamkilling and revolting every time.
Can we join from tlauncher ( if not ,please bro make an event for some broke .. crack version using players like me
Artic team trash asf 💀💀 Mfs didn’t even fight back
i were annoyed many times of ize lol
25:20  I also thought that getting rid of such a player would avoid problems in the future
Every time Ize says they need to attack first to win he loses to the last civilization that spent more time working together. Maybe he should, uh, learn something from that?
Ize just ruins the whole thing because if he's not king he gets mad and plans and assassin and it's just not fair for people trying to gear up and fight other civilization
Ize ruins these videos lmaoo. He's so annoying its not even entertaining.
Rip techno blade hey squid kif
where are you form
Ize makes for such a hatable character,it’s always interesting to see his shenanigans
Love his intro I wonder how he made it?
This like the wet dream of mr best but his vision is real life
ize is a dictator.
I'm getting sick of ize
Is it just me or  is Ize just insanely annoying
I like how every video ize says “his team sucks” when he doesnt help
Suep watched his clan get slaughtered, and said, no more gentlemens duel for anyone😭💀
Who keeps putting Ize and Starkiller on the same team😭
I’m pissed that arctic lost the building comp 😞  They had such nice builds too
Ize is obnoxious, not watching further. Stop inviting him to these things.
Bro can we have a vote to kick ize out of these videos he is ruining the fun of the video
SUep is literally the backstabber of the century
Why does everyone hate starkiller. Honestly makes me mad. The man is good at pvp always leads and helps his comunity yet get hoed over and team killed every single game without fail. Yall suck for picking on him. Not cool
Honestly take ize out these events no one likes him and it’s clear… he’s a prick
Why is Ize constantly being an annoying ruthless bastard in these videos? I always happy to see him lose
Izzy is kill sark I’ll er every time
The more you watch these videos, the more the same people (i.e. Starkiller, Ize, etc...) keep popping up. They are becoming infamous at this point
Honestly I'm at 30:00 mintues and I've seen a lot of these vids and ize is a strong leader it's just the way he handles it it's a little aggressive it is good but it's bad at the same time if he changes a little bit he might have a chance to at least make a comeback and win, I really like his leadership he just needs to changes something's and then he can become powerfully unbeatabl..
Great video
ize is so fawking annoying in every single one of these videos
Bro why does starkiller always get killed??
genshin impact
The artic was the best civilization :(
I’m glad that the jungle king died like his ego was up to 100000000000000000000000000 that fight humbled him
Squid kids still the second best potato farmer….techno has perm #1
I hated Ize but you got to admit the guy is a fucking conqueror 😂
I wanted the arctic to win
Ize is such a deekhead
the jungle village was the worst it looked so ugly compared to the other two
Love the way u used some super mario bros music on this video
Who else agrees ize needs to be banned from the rest of the events
Worst death of all: cornered by a bunch of geared noobs
Ize is such a trash leader lmao.
The deserts deserved that victory
"The Best potato farmer, wait i read that wrong Second best potato farmer" 💀
I like so much the way you show the people travelling through the map
they have a necromantion
Is the server still public?
The Zombie rushing to help his comrades was hilariously XD
So basically just always kill Ize first so that the most problematic player gets out.
Ize is such a loser bruh, ruins any video he's in dawg
When you gonna kick ize off bro
Ize in this episode reminds me of king Joffree from game of thrones
Jungle
It's incredible what a dick the Jungle king was.
could’ve had way more content had you not let Ize in the game. Instead you let him ruin your hard work modding these servers out just for a dipshit to mess it up.
20:47 hello who wants to die today?
Kinda commend suep and the remaining ice team members for sticking it out and really making a mark after their team was decimated
I would just join one of these servers just to kill izes 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish Ize just wasnt in these videos
Desert was best
the admins need to do better voting on bases
It’s just so painful to watch Ize. Not even a good villain character to watch. Please, stop inviting this guy to these games. I get you may be friends, but apparently I’m not the only one with this sentiment in these comments
Bruh we learn in this video never choose leader like ize he always makes decisions without thinking 😂
Ize is honestly frustrating. I know the whole point is to strategize and become the last team standing but his ego makes him treat this like hunger games. It’s meant to be creating a civilization, not just mindless combat.  His reasonings to be King is always that he’s good at PvP when all he does is use his teammates as bait and takes all the credit. Then proceeds to fight dishonourably and STILL ends up losing.
2:31 squid kid shade I love it lol
Genshin impact is the sponsor 💀💀💀
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssss they won 😁😃☺️🤣😇😌😗🙃💗😅😆😉😙😘😂😊🥳🤪🤩🤗🤗🙂😱😍🥰❤️🖤😄😆😉
Has ize ever won
Love the vids
love the vid <3
Dame ize is a freakin good player pvp he must be the king everytime
Ize is too annoying to bother subbing and watching anymore.
This Ize guy makes the videos too predictable and obnoxious.
isn't I'm a squid kid the guy that technoblade farmed potatoes against. 😂
i genuinely can’t stand ize
Jungle = n@zi's Desert = soviets
dude i was not expecting nestor to be in hre bro
Every one here shut up star killer was to nice and he was dumb he would lead the colony into slow death
As someone who lives in the Mojave something in my soul is extremely pleased about the outcome.  but that aside it has been interesting to see throughout the videos with Ize. I feel like he would be an incredible bezerker if reigned in properly. but that's the main issue is he is loud and honestly skilled, His major flaws however make him a doomed cycle it seems. He knows how to bully his way to the top and secure good gear, and is just charismatic enough to get a few loyal goons. However his brutish and selfish nature seems to be what constantly ends him and his nations.  Also it seems that the reason his K/D is so high is because he seems to know how to target the weaker opponents out of group which widdles down his opponents until his forces can just overwhelm. at least for the first battle, as after the first, whatever nation remains will have likely become aware, and shore up cohesion.
I have Subscribed, From Philippines 🇵🇭
I originaly liked winter but i converted to desert
Hopefully Ize realizes other people also want to have fun and his cocky attitude has negligible long term benefits...  :')
Ize's voice is soooo annoying and he is also really rude.
I loved this series and it would be cool for you to reface another one, otherwise continue what you are doing
i want to join one of these and kill ize day 1 lmao
lol, Ize, the worst leader possible to have.
I thought the jungle had the worst build but I think they do it for script so the bad guy, Ize gets the best loot
Na buh desert should’ve won that airdrop
How did the snow civilization not win? They definitely had the best looking city
Jungle all the way
time deo????
Honest opinion about Ize and Suep. They are both childish morons. The Ize's whole thing looked like what happends when you give 7 year old too much money and make his parents his slaves. He is narsitistic, easily heated, not a team player, snake and stupid, all the things leader is not meant to be. Suep is just a stupid betraying insecure player with too much pvp experience. They both are getting heated if someone critizises them and they just wanna be accepted to the group but they missed the sings that they dont need to be superior to be part of something great. After all I think they are mentally 5 years old and very insecure for getting judged
I'm happy not many people like the way Ize plays
Ize seems like a jerk. Lol
Omg saitama and his company every time kill starkiler, EVERY EPISODE its looks boring
me vibing to the genshin impact backgruond music
Man remove Ize, that dumb kid is making these videos hard to watch
idea: a new map and the same players :) (but they have ability's and powers)
Ize is so toxic😊
Ize is the most unlikeable recurring characters in this series. Got a headache from how often I rolled my eyes
Bro-- Jungle Deserved That win LMAO, Artic's we're weak asl
PrivateFearless go crazyyyyyy
I think Squidkid got his nr1 potato farmer title back...
Bro they've got Jerry seinfield on the dwarf team
I like how in all the videos I watched ize and his army always die when he is elected king
GENSHIN IMPACT IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE
bro how does  the barrier lock plased at 1: 49
for me i would say genshin impact = fatness lvl 69, genshin impact = nikke = h###ai and its just so boring i dont really like those games :/
How was the arctic last place in building it was for sure better then the dessert so at least should have been 2nd
I hate Ize if I’m ever in a game with him he’s dying onm
The genshin impact guy was like oh this a genshin impact thing zombie be like nah Mann die
The fact that no one strategies like, if they could have been ready and filled the arctic town with tnt and scout outside, when they come they do the tnt and boom
Bro everyone is such a puss, “ize killed the fun🤓” sorry he’s just better
IZE YOU SUCK
I lobe i am a squid kid in this all tho his team lost he had a lot of funny lines like "Dont believe in him guys he just has an accent!"
These videos have the same heads everytime being king no cap
I wouldn't be surprised if Ize picked the warriors role 🤣 Also that I've wanted to be king At the start I'm rooting for Arctic to win I'm never watching silver again And I actually thought that Arctic would win the build comp because of their builds and their joyful spirits
Public Service Announcement: Kill IZE and SAITAMA FIRST if they're in your team.
Ize sounds like homelander of this server.
Ize is so annoying
im in love with the irish lad trying to kill everyone
I wonder if they will ever all work together for the full thirty days and no war will occur at all
We all know technoblade is the best potato farmer
Desert deserved that w rip to starkiller (the true king) and screw ize
Ize seem like a douchebag. I was hoping that everyone follow Starkiller to the death and ize had to solo the whole thing by himself.
Abstrex is mvp
bro made a genshin impact cult 🤣🤣🤣💀💀
I love the Mario music
"So, the best potato farmer... wait i read that wrong, the SECOND best potato farmer squid started farming potatos."  Squid never living that down
Me when he said genshin impact: NOOOOOOHOEEE  (Yeah i really don't like genshin impact)
I wonder how sir vik would do in these.
0:10 technobode?
Ize just seemed like a bit of a knob
Bro the jungle king kid is so annoying bro straight ruined his team
I loved the arctic's spirit, it would've been much more enjoyable to watch the arctic civilization's growth than to watch a rushed invasion in my opinion simply due to ize's temper. And the zombie member was an entire mood lmfaoo
Well to be fair squid kid IS the new best potato farmer   *Rest in Peace Technoblade*
I don't understand Ize backlash. This how wars are truely maintained.
woww playing genshin as u get sponsered
29:56  🥺🥴🤤😭🤣
Little fun fact: Why didn’t the jungle people do what the Roman republic did having consuls The Roman republic didn’t like the idea of kings so they decided to make two people to share power and have one year terms so the jungle people are not in the IQ category.   Edit: people are mad about this comment it was a joke
I was thinking jungle will win but no I wanted desert to win anyway
The zombie clutch
I think it would be nice if civilizations have unique buffs
Q for ize are u Irish?
Ize a douche fr
istg i keep hearing genshin fighting music in the background of almost every minecraft vids
The zombie part is funny af
at this point ize is just so desperate to win and be the king he’s so self-centered and manipulating people just to win 💀💀 kinda embarrassing tbh.
wow
Why is 5aitama and ize are always the bad guy
I hate ize he always starts so some stuff with starkiller I feel bad for starkiller
i feel bad for the arcrtic from the ravenger, that isint fair.
i wanted the desert to win
I was like wow he spawned diamonds in front of him
Desert were so funny  When he became king everyone was like woahhh yeeahh and then someone placed a tnt so then it went like noo😂 And when he asked arctic "You killed none gosh" 😂man those were hilarous and that guy who wanted to join desert from jungle had such a good backstory and sad end.  Gotta say GREAT VIDEO!
ize spice things up and makes the video more entertaining
حلو
Noooooo
I really dont like Ize, he is just so annoying. Even though he becomes king a lot, he hardly ever  wins
Bro that desert zombie attacking the jungle king got me cracking😂
35:53 Well damn.
Literally in every video  Ize tries to take power
I em 9
Nice Ester egg calling squid kid the 2nd potato farmer
“Throwing an ended pearl to escape, but landing on my head and dying to fall damage” got me dying😂😂😂😂😂😂
ize ruined the vid ngl
I sure hope ize was acting bc if not I fucking hate his guts
Yo star just wanted to help the person in the cave but he died 😢 Rest In Peace my friend
I don’t mean to be rude but Ize killing people that annoy him and killing off a good leader who the people liked is such immature behavior. Like bruhh chill out
14:23 Ize: yo guys I’m gonna elect myself king if that’s alright  *dead silence*  Not sure who: ummmm no
ize hella cringe tbh... I get mining the whole game but tryna force urself as king just makes u seem like u have main character syndrome
*xNestorio joined the game*
11:13 then how did he survive the hunger event?
I’ve just ruins these videos. He’s super power hungry. I’m guessing he’s such a jerk because he knows that will get him video time. He so full of himself. He’s not enjoyable as a protagonist. The only joy I have when he’s on camera is when he dies.
35:50 honestly caught me off guard that was funny for no reason.
2:20 best moment XD
Respect to silver for talking about techno at the start   (only legends know)
26:46
5:00 that inevitably guy sacrificed himself for voxet
I liked jungle
I hate ize Soo much like bro acting like a kid 🤓
2:58  People who downloaded the game : And that's how I became obese
even the desert lose so many player at first but they still come back i know that jungle will lose when ize become the king
You did the snow civilization very dirty turned *SUSMAS* into a a KISSING PARTY
Why are there so many ads…
0:09 i saw techno's name lol
The warmongering jungle team would have definitelly won if a more proper concensus and strategy could've been reached/utilized, but dude wanted to play generic Bandit King with his team.
Bruh sliver barely has any videos but there always crazy and cool and he makes me spend 40 minutes to watch his vids and waiting for him to upload
Sadly I can’t join these because I am on console on bedrock I don’t have a PC and laptop:(
Ize was carrying his whole team man must be pretty tired carrying all of that weight
Nice vid
omg speedsilver straight up roasted squidkid in 2:20
Desert
We have to honour la Monk 🤣🤣🤣🤣
jungle da best
HOW DO I JOIN ON OF THESE THIS LOOKS SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!
should've tricked them and gave the best supply drop to the worse team, otherwise you're just giving the best/most efficient players the best advantage when they've already proven they have advantage of having a stacked team lol
Ize is Low-key annoying ngl.
the funny thing is that each time one of these happens is that theres always that one group that wants to choose violence every time instead of being smart always dies and the people always vote for them again
I just learned Genshin lmpact
W for technoblade refrence
to be honest this video was absolutely awsome , but the one thing i didnt really like was the town voting imo the jungle one barely had any building and they were really small and ugly and the arctic was really beautiful but still they both did well in this tournament
Genshin impact is a pretty cool game I downloaded it I made an account it's pretty cool
1:43 “Rune faster” 🥸☕️
The zombie teammate 😂🤣😂🤣
How do you not fight back? Like… don’t be France
Yo Ize is cocky man damn. Real dictator
ize is so rude he sukcs
I wanted jungle to win but the last part I still enjoyed keep up the great work with the videos!
I love how in the battle royale suep was a powerful betrayer but in this he was a priest
Ize is bad and sucks!
By far the best storyline ever
DESERT FOR THE WIN
ize is like h1tler
Dude if i was in your game I'm gonna be  one of the two to choose and that two are the farmer or the miner because im not even good at fighting and also i am going to be a farmer
I thought the snow team won the build contest
I love these vids
So desert killed a jungle king that loves genshin impact at the end and so that means desert members hate genshin
i liked the ice kingdom the best
“The straw huts.” Me: “Nani! Mugiwara no Luffy!”
the irish guy is so annoying
Ize kept boasting about how he has a much more better gear than Star but compared to him, Star has more of a better strategy to win against other civilizations compared to Ize’s mindless brute force strat.
Worst episode ever
19:54 you just shattered ize's world with tho's diamonds.... Shattered
PLZ PLZ PLZZZZZZZZZZZ CAN I HAVE A PART 2!?!
Ize remindes me of connor mcgregor
Ahh the Genshin impact song
Rewatching this I didnt realize how much i disliked Ize Bro spoiled the fun for the whole Artic team and his own team( at least partially) was being a dickhead the whole time, a scheming little shithead, acted like toddler who didnt get his way, and overall just someone I wouldn't want to play with or against( at least what was shown from this vid at the time) and you know what was the funny part? It was all for nothing Acted like he was top dawg for getting lucky with the best loot and still lost Just let this be a reminder, you gotta focus on a underdeveloped team instead of the better or equal team,  you're probably not a good player or good leader
Technoblade never dies
This Ize guy is really Intitled, he really manipulates the weak players bruh. Like If he were a president of any country 100% he will be a dictator
If starkiller would be the leader not all of the jungle would be dead 🗿🗿
Genshin is sooo hard
Ize gets mad so easily dang  He is bossing everybody around I see why people don’t care for him
4:14
ize went full razputin
Am I the only one who hates Ize?
Rip best potato farmer 😢
Izes really doesn't understand that people won't elect you if you're a dick.
The jungle kingdom was my favourite but when star killer got ambushed my favourite kingdom was desert kingdom
2:22 love to see the great pitato war refrence. RIP technoblade
Jungle
Happy new year 🎊🎊
The Best potato farmer is Technoblade
i liked the jungle the best
How do I join the game?
i loved the jungle civ, especially ize, he's always fun to watch   can't wait to read hate comments from those sweet femboys  😂
Can I be in your videos I am a best Minecraft player
Can make events for bedrock and java to plz
gives the king buff to the strongst guy in team but not be the true king in the team and the true king is that someone who have leaderships
Are we able to play on Pocket Edition, or bedrock edition?
I know this is a late comment but I love how theirs Mario  music for every biom
21:26 squid has a cold because of the environment
Jungle
I play genshin
"wait no, i read that wrong. second best potato farmer in minecraft: squidkid"
Im a certified ize hater
2:22 lol rip TECHNOBLADE
LOL sorry squid kid silver overestimated you!
Damn ize must have felt ashamed
NOOOOOO YOU DID NOT JUST DO THAT TO SQUID, THE POOR MAN
The artic whit the tree
lesson learned: never cause internal problems
Actually it was the Mayans that built their temple in the jungle. Not the Aztecs. The Aztecs built theirs in the middle of a lake.
wth
You are Awsome those video must take a really long time good job
Waverlyguy should have won fr
Ize sounds like a young Andrew Tate 💀
Ize is so toxic
The artic had the best build yet they get last
I love how he says the best potato farmer and then realised it was squid he said 2nd best farmer 😂
What is genshin impact....i still dont understand
Fgdbd
I love how he corrected himself and said "sorry second best potato farmer squid kid" it was so wholesome to see that he said techno was the best.
Why does the bad people get all of the good things🤔
Squid technically the best now
So I just stumbled unto this channel and have been binge watching pretty much all the civilization videos  and from what I've seen  If  you get into one of these and are on the same side with Ize and 5aitama and you want to win then the best strategy  is to defect right then and there.  By the looks of it, the team that has Ize and 5aitama are usually disorganized. That side unfortunately fails due to poor leadership and power-grabbing.  They may be strong pvpers but they lack in leadership and with a team consisting of 30+ players, you NEED a strong leader and not a blood thirsty berserker. Now I will admit that the power-grabbing berserker strategy does work sometimes. But most of the time it will fail.  Either way as a viewer of these series  I find the series  incredibly entertaining to watch.
pissed me off how you said artic was last
Silver just roasted squid kid , RIP TechnoBlade.
Honestly, I'm getting really tired of Ize. He's a good antagonist, but it gets VERY boring when every single video Ize is being an extreme, entitled, mean tyrant.  Antagonists are good in any civilization video, but when it's one guy being genuinely vile to his teammates, it really sucks the fun out of the entire video. Why watch someone be a tyrant for the 172351626th time when you can have actual strategies and warfare tactics to make a good video?   I'm just so tired of seeing Ize hoard all the loot and get angry when he loses because he acts like a petulant child who's unable to share.
“I’d rather get blown up” 😂
this ize guy had me pressed
Imagine the guy who died and some how turned into a zombie saw this 😂 he had the best run even in death
im late but take ize out of these videos, just so annoying to listen to him complain and take the fun out of it
lol 2nd best potato Farmer
Ize is the worst king i have ever seen pls do not add him to future videos
I want to join please
Dude i hate Ize so much
Tbh without ize there would be no content lol
SQID IS NOW OLD IS TKNO
IZE IS SUCH A GREEDY PERSON HE WANT EVERYTHING.
Viewed
If I join I'm targeting ize
starkiller: grate job ize ize: what a waffle
hail Hubert
2:22 TECHNOBLADE IS THE BEST POTATO FRAMER
Fun fact:Starkiller is actually the name of an insanely op Star Wars character
“Was killed off guard by a creeper” *died to a phantom*
I❤ize
did anybody notice the guy that died in the jungle region protected his afk teammates w the creeper😭
i honestly dont know why the arctic always gets last place in every building competition but they have very good builds.
Girls Sleepover : OMG i Forgot My Makeup   Boys Sleepover :
Bro ize is dumb LOL   He lost to the thing that starkiller was trying to do, that's rough.   The Jungle was an island surrounded by a body of water, ambush is nearly impossible. They had great pvpers, geographic location, equipment but lost to one of the weakest kingdoms. 💀
At the beginning I rooted for the Jungle Nation  When The king was crowned ah hell nah
Desert
Ize sucked 💀 and it was funny when the dessert members zombie joined the fight 😂😂😂
SpeedSilver : Lead by the BEST potato farmer- Me : Excuse me what did you say? SpeedSilber : oops sorry I read that wrong, SECOND BEST potato farmer Me : Thats much better 😊
lol I read that wrong
"best Potato farme- hold on read that wrong Second best potato farmer"💀💀💀💀
i love your vidoes
It’s so unfair that the jungle didn’t get good loot because those people stoll them
I’m sorry but how bad do you have to be to die from a zombies two hit
Who remembers when he was at 10k subs
if genshin was a pvp game i would beat every one up
sUep_ is such a traitor like he couldve won if he stayed loyal to desert
I would’ve voted for Jungle if Starkillwr was king
Ize needs to stop shooting for leader and should just let Starkiller be the leader and maybe Ize could be a general but that’s a big maybe because he’s a little too pompous
Ize is a textbook dictator, even tho its sad to watch him easily manipulate/scare everyone its also fascinating.
I can’t be the only one who thinks ize is a power hungry asshole right?
I can feel my power
snow and pls make a sequel
I would've put snow in first
Ize you are a menace
Honestly when I’m old enough I promise to be in one of these videos
Jungles king was a real leader
Technoblade never dies 👑🐷
Bro that ize pisses me off
Me being for artic
lets go desert
I thought Ize was brutal but that doesn’t compare to Suep’s brutal tactics to kill people
I think Ize is toxic kinda
Why is it ize always seems to be the villain of the video for some reason
HE REALLY HAD TO CORRECT HIMSELF THAT SQUIDKID WAS THE 2ND BEST POTATO FARMER! 😂😂😂😂
what is the music at 1:22
Can you make more medival video’s the are realy 😎
fr no one likes ize
Honestly hate ize, he's beyond toxic
Why is Ize always so toxic and egotistical in these games smh. Has to rule every time, it always leads to their defeat.
Get a humongous area like the Badlands with little resources get a whole lot of players there is not enough resources to go around what do you do share or murder that would be interesting
I feel that starkiller has a tendency of betrayal and creating drama... he needs a psychiatrist asap..
I bet ize is a pain to be with in person, god he is so annoying.
bruh the amount people here saying ize is the worst lol can you people atleast consider that he acts for content instead of hating on him or atleast consider that he doesnt act like this in his video nor in real life ive never watche ize video because i just recently started watching this channel and i immedietly know thats hes acting for the video
if im ever in one of these and ize is in my civillization, just saying but first thing im doing even before punching trees, is killing him
14:28 that guys brutally honest
how ironic that his name was starkiller, who was vader's apprentice, and he didnt want to fight
If I were to pick the classes, I’d pick the miner, because I’m not very good at fighting and is impatient
Suep the pokemon lol
Plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz make more of these there soo cool and interesting
Yo Ize just kills the fun of the game, he makes everyone go murderhobo and berserk attacks after he seizes power through manipulation. Seriously it's just painful to watch mindless aggression and coersion. It is incredibly satisfying to see it fail though
Lol they called ize Izzie
I quoted the moment that America declared war on Japan in this one.  "JUST TODAY, (I forget the date) THE UNITED STATES OF THE DESERT WAS SUDDENLY AND DELIBERETLY ATTACKED, BY NAVAL AND AIR FORCES OF THE EMPIRE OF THE JUNGLE. I AM ASKING THE PEOPLE, AND KING TO DECLARE WAR ON THE JUNGLE FOR THE CASUALTIES THAT SHOCK THIS NATION. I VOW REVENGE FOR THE FALLEN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME."   good times eh?
Genshin impact sponsor 💀💀💀
Long live desert!
I really like these movies!
I love the technoblade reference
So... why is Ize still allowed in these?
That dessert zombie payed off. Scripted or not, it was hilarious
Eyes
Honestly it was cool the first time. But having the same guys being the bad guys every video gets annoying.
zombie is a legend fr
Can you stop brining Ize in to these? He really just ruins the fun
Love the super mario bros from the wii music solid
ize is seriously making me wanna stop watching these vids
This is like ww2
Just one time I want starkiller to prevail and become the true king
I don’t like ize
Jungle team ruined it but it is what it is IG
dude wy did IZE force everyone to go starkiller should have been king
Haha, that Ize guy is such a big headed dickhead, and always gets whats coming to him.
"Says the same 6 things" meanwhile he was saying "Diamonds and Encahnament"  :D
I liked the dessert kingdom the most. They kept a fallen ally as a zombie which ended up helping kill the jungle king and was used to kill the last enemy player left.  All hail the dessert kingdom.
The desert are doing pretty good
I hate ize
Ize isn't unfun he just has fun in a different way then some other people were not all the same so people should stop saying "ize sucks the fun out of everything."
I would love to have another video of this
I already completed the storyline and I got most characters
35:05 that's what you get for treason
I’d like to see a challenge where the separate civilizations are incentivized to cooperate against increasingly harder challenges involving mob raids, famine, disease, and other environmental events. People like Ize would make a terrible leader when actual leadership is needed instead of brute force and fear tactics.
If a female player was elected as ruler, would they be called queen?
Omg Xnestrio Omg
bruh on every video there is the same shit with Ize
I love how Ize never wins
27:02
i always get so sad when the sttaff votes on the ugliest towns. the arctic town was the prettiest. 😢
genshin is the most cringe p2w game ever
Ize just seemed like a dick
0:01
Bout to stop watching every video Ize is in.
so glad jungle didn't win
happy to see that everyone hates ize, stop letting him in these videos
Fk ize man, you keep ruining the event by violating and stuff and also couldn't even lead the members.
Ize acting is very good
Yea Ize is just toxic and sucks any enjoyment out.
I've just watched 2 of these videos back to back and I'm already tired of Ize and his crew. The first time was cool and all, but it seems like every video they're in turns out the exact same. Starkiller gets elected king, Ize and his friends kill him, and then Ize leads their team to failure. I think there should be more variety in the cast members because it gets old really fast
Bruh those jungle and desert ff’rs can’t build artic for sure had the best looking build wtf yall judging, had your eyes closed?
Why is ize like always killing the leader?
ppl hating on ize but without ppl like him these videos would be god awful fucking boring LMAO. no one wants to see a lets play. ppl want action
is this only Java or can bedrock players play on these to?
Lord, I really don't like Ize.
One is garbage get him out the vids dude completely ruins them
that asbtrekt zombie made me laugh so much XD
Silver fell for his own trap. Then didnt set it back up. Lmao
I ❤ Genshin Impact
34:53 Oh man... i really felt bad for him
Arctic on top
def jungle
The start of star killer and ize's rivalry
i already predicted that jungle is going to lose because of its ruthless and selfish leader personalities tyhe best move is to choos star as the king and gather rescoreses and make the team even stronger and not making the first move
What’s the theme song for the building competition
15:08 she kinda deserved that ngl
Man this vid was painful to watch with that jungle leader there
If you have Ize in your team, you're bound to lose lol
ize is so fucking annoying
You should make a large server with different groups and Allie’s so it can be more interesting
What’s with people wanting to overthrow kings
Ize and Saitama are like kid and killer from one piece
Please stop putting ize in the vids he's jarring and just ruins great content
Every vid has starkiller being the first leader and get killed in the middle
Despite the fact that Ize was a war mongering tyrant, he took action and made things interesting. I was rooting for the jungle team.
i liked as usual it's very good
Ize sucks
God i am so happy that ize died. MF is so delusional hahaha
i was rooting for the jungle nation, until StarKiller was killed.. after that i was rooting for the desert nation.
For how annoying Ize is, he at least makes it entertaining to hate him and always hopes he loses. Then u see  it happen which makes it all the more sweeter to watch. 😆 🤣  lol.
Is there a way for people to join these because I’d love to
Squid kid 2nd best potato farmer
No way he Sponsered genshin impact 💀
37:22 "no no no AHhHahshhahahajahahaha-"
I like how everyone in the chat just collectively shits on Ize lol
If saitama and ize actually work with there team better and not care so much for getting the crown their team could maybe actually win, as people always kill others for the crown with lowers their chance of winning-
I have seen 2 of these "simulation videos (the other being the medieval simulation). And I just have to say...fuck Ize and Saitama.
Looking back this great start of a rivalry of Izz vs starkiller
lol what is your social security
can you get ize out cuz he ruins all these videos by crying
Ize is like the biggest kid i ever seen
Petition to replace ize
My favorite Nation was the artic
Maybe the cow despawn
Squid kid must win bc he battled technoblade I’m saying this when u said 2nd best potato farmer
My favorite was desert
IZE IS A TRUE WARRIOR!
How don’t ppl immediately kill Ize
" Uh, Second best potato farmer  " respect to Techno legend
At the start that guy who put himself in the way of the creeper to save his afk allies RESPECT
I love the amogus it's my favorite game! :D
Ize has lost so much that hopefully he wins in one video atleast to pull out an avengers infinity war
The genshin music hits hard ngl
I didn't mind Ize playing the warmongering leader, but I was a bit disappointed about Starkiller and his supporters.  - Did Starkiller not hear about the things Ize's crew were saying to the others? Did he really not expect anything? Why not get some loyalists on his side to make some sort of pact? Personally would've went with the "lets split and move elsewhere" route, but a civil war would've been cool too.  - Why didn't more of his supporters rebel? I was just waiting the entire time for some rebels amongst Ize's army to start doing some fun, sneaky shenanigans. There were so many fun ways for them to try and sabotage Ize's army (steal gear for Desert and Arctic, attack Jungle fighters during big battles, abandon the battle altogether to start some other project, etc.). They spoke up, yea, but most acted like sheep. There was 1 guy who tried to defect and was killed as a result, and that was cool! It made me think of the ways I'd offer aid as a rebel, perhaps a bit of roleplay like "Greetings, weary travelers! I come from far away, but I'm low on food. Would you like to trade some food for my enchanted gear?" I guess they were going along with the momentum of Ize's victory, and some of them did seem to like the combat.  That being said, loved the video, especially the guy who was brought back to life! Having him fight Ize was such a great and fitting plot twist! Loved to see that man's tireless efforts not go to waste! I'm sure the guy who died was flattered to see his reanimated corpse chase the Forest's warmongering king!
Even Though Abstrekt Did Not Know What Was Going On, He Got A Kill And Helped His Nation Defeat The Jungle And Arctic
I must say Ize is just not funny to ear and watch. Constantly hoarding loot and downplaying everyone around him.
What is Ize deal?
I've come to understand one thing from these videos. That Ice guy is an insufferable weirdo with absolutely no leadership ability. He just yells at everyone to listen to him and betrays his own team when they (understandably) don't like him.
Make more vids!!!!!
Star killer is a better leader
The “wait I read that wrong, the second best potato farmer in Minecraft.” Had me crying. Rip techno
Hey can I still try to join these events even though I don't have discord but still have twitter?
37:47 LMAOOO
I love your adventures lol
play huggy wuggy
LoL this is my fourth video I watched and starkiller seems to get assassinated a lot by ize.
I have watched a ton of this civilization vids and omg I am in LOVE with Ize, please have him play more!!
Jack: sounds easy enough Abstrekt: *shows a uno reverse card* Jack: OH NO-
Jungle!!!!!
The arctic was by far the best
ngl ize sound really annoying
I have never been a fan of Ize
For honor war map in minecraft lol
Unfortunately he is now the best potato farmer…..
hehehe              Roblox
Whoever has Ize on their team should just vote him straight away
daddy
Ya don’t think I’d ever join one of these to many high and mighty people
I’ve learned that to never listen to ize
rip for the guy who tried to say the sponsor of this video...
i’m tired of the same three four people just steamrolling and being tyrannical. get more variety
Imagine if the last jungle guy succeeded, woildve been a wonderful ending
You are punishing aggressiveness and action by letting them join forces. Reward a successful invasion somehow. More action content.
I love the baby panda and the attic
Jungle team
Just realized squid kid is the best potato farmer
You should make this but it in ice age
that ize guy plays the game like he's nazi or something lol
Jungle get better at the game bro lol
I love this video
Can't tell if Ize is being insufferable on purpose (playing the antagonist) or if that's just who he is
Jangle  is good
I don't like ize
Ize will fail in society IRL and I hope he does fail
I hate use now
“Don’t be persuaded, he just has an accent!” 💀💀
I really love how the farmer of the jungle kingdom was lost and was the last one
‘I read that wrong… Second best potato farmer’ Techno
Ize just dooms any team he is put on
Love your videos ❤😊
JUNGLE IS THE BEST
JUNGLE FOR THE WIN
I LOVE JUNGLE LETS GO GG DESTERT
Can bedrock play
Ize and saitama are the worst kind of people
I'm playing genshin while watching. I thought the music was from the game
i got sad when artic got last in the town building
Jungle
And you killed non of them le gasp
2:23 I guess squid kid is the best potato farmer now rip technoblade may he be remembered.
What the jungle king is using a kogic why does he had a chesplate and an elytra
Yo I wanna play this
Ize "I've got more experience in a fight" Also Ize "Gets 2 kills"
hey silver i just wanted so say i really enjoy your videos they are great!could you mabe do something asian. maybe 3 different races like ninjas(who have many abilitys like invisibility{temporary},camouflage,throwing bombs,kunais,shurikens and being able to climb blocks),samurai(who can block projectiles being the only fraction{faction?sorry im not that good at english}who can wear armor and have blocking or conter attack abilitys) and oni (which have the double amount of hearts,+5dmg and abilitys like breating fire)
Ize is Andrew tate
I hate Ize..... bruv just because you have full diamond enchanted armor doesn't mean you can become king like that's all you did... diamonds just diamonds.... he's to materialistic and doesn't think of others. He didn't even do anything to the team except an enchantment table and the team had the beg him for it  Edit: "He's made a farm congrats" you didn't do sh*t and that farm will feed the people fighting
Minecraft War of the Three Kingdoms
ize is a very interesting character. i respect him being a villian and facing all hate and it makes the event more interesting to watch. no hate to ize
Honestly snowy civilisation should’ve gotten best dropppppp!”((
I really love your videos. Love the concepts, the drama, the pacing is great.   But.. it is not always “begun”.. it’s supposed to be “began”. I know neither of us have perfect grammar. But that specifically really grinds my gears.
Them killing the among us statue was actually funny
13M views on this video is INSANE
LETS GO DESERT
People keep going under Ize's leadership and constantly lose when they do. Guess nobody learns?
Bro i swear that ize guy is a dick like the only thing he knows is to get stacked. He doesnt even know how to communicate well with others, doesnt respect others, bragging his abilities (he doesnt even know how to strategize, he only knows how to mine and get rich💀), and even elect himself as king. LIKE BRO YOU DONT EVEN KNOW YOUR MEMBERS
imagine he died to the zombie zombie be like: hrrrrr hhhhhrrrrrrr (i must help my team)
I don't know why but dumb people still follow ize hahha
Lol Suep chose every wrong decision
Okay but u got around 8million hours of watch time from this video... That's insane. (Idk how many ads cuz premium but i guess these videos make you rich ;p)
i here from november 2022 to tell u that u r right about the number 1 potato farmer
Let's gooo! I despised the jungle king so I'm glad desert won.
As infuriating as Ize’s behavior in some of these 100 player vids, I do enjoy him being in them, he makes for a good sort of war freak, someone like Megatron per-say…
... why more genshin
Jungle. The determination and battle fought,and battles won.
2:22 love the technoblade potato war reference
21k comments holy god
RIP sqwid kid😭😭😭
Actually, i hate ize because of him, Starkiller Always gets killed
i liked jungle until ize took over then i was rooting for desert
What I’ve learnt from these videos is that you should always kill ize because he’s an ass
Imagine technoblade amd dream joined the desert civilisiasion Idk how to spell it
Ize is so much fun lol
Hi
Starkiller is best
2:24 why u gotta bully squidkid like that he tried his best to be the best potato farmer :9
petition to not allow ice in future vids
The best part is seeing the series evolve with Starkiller having his revenge from Ize 😂 later on
At 12:43 ize could of had fire aspect :v
Ive been watching ur videos 5 hours straight no cap
jungle
0:47 Day 1: - The Beginning  2:33 - 3:56 Hunger Event 5.53 Border Expansion  9:10 Town Building  10:49 King Election 24:42 Blood Moon 25:23 Death of Starkiller 29:20 Jungle vs Arctic  31:30 Desert reaction to the war  32:48 Arctic players retreat to Desert 33:53 Jungle decides to invade Desert 34:32 “DON’T THINK JUST KILL” - Arctic joins Desert - Jungle vs Desert/Arctic  40:07 End of the war
Ize is so cool lmao, plays the best antagonist in the series
9 million subs u still don't have that
2:19“second best potato farmer hits hard now rip TechnoBlade.😢
Am I the only one who feels like Ize is definitely the most toxic player in these series? Like, he always goes after Star in order to become king, never shares any loot and the only time he does share loot is when he wants to use that loot to say he's king
no prison
these would be so much better if Ize wasnt such a prat
Ize is a big W just some cowards couldn't 8fght with him
I wanna see an Ize vs Airokun fight.
Desert Zombie was the MVP of the experiment 100%
Ize is so annoying GODDDDDDDDDDD
can i join on console?
I was rooting for Jungle until that guy got elected as King. The moment he did, I knew that Jungle was going to lose, and I wanted them to. They did do better than I thought, but that's only because the other civilizations didn't really prepare any defenses. All I thought when the illegitimate king became leader was "bad leader is bad".
Idk Second time I got recommended this kind of Video and I still really dislike Ize
The arctic or dessert jungle Is terrible thanks to there leader
glad the tyrant got rolled lol
dang i actually feel bad for the kid that was so loyal to starkiller then tries to trade sides and gets murked
Silver is bad because he didnt said eaven hello pls can sumbody ban silver from youtube and give me his minecraft pls

Ize is so annoying
21:12
That first guy we saw die gave their life for that other player, gg
_Ize got me like 😐   Boy I love arrogant players 😑
23:42 saving this for myself
I hope Ize is doing a character fr because he’s insufferable
Who else is playing 3.1 while listening to this? :)
Can I join a video
Silver:The best potato farmer Squid ki- wait thats not right I meant the second best potato farmer Squid kid Me:damn I miss Technoblade
How o get in your video
13:45 why is this saitama guy and his friend always trying to kill their leaders???
The time put to bring the zombie actually helped
arctic was my favorite because they were so peaceful and wholesome. They were like the Cancer zodiac sign of this event tbh. My 2nd fav was desert because they had good loyalty and good combat. I hated the jungle team because of their king he was so fake and didn't care about anyone but himself. He lied to the players multiple times and then tried to gaslight them into picking him as the king bc he had better gear but overall was a bad leader whom no one originally wanted to listen to.
Is that the music from Super Mario Bros for the Wii, world 5?
"jump if you like genshin impact!" All the discord mods: WHOOO
from the start of mc mp, players have lived together peacefully- every server except a skyblock server: HELLO THERE :))))  here we have the best potato farmer- no sorry, the SECOND best 💀  a player was caught off guard by a creeper- the phantom: am i a joke to u
Is this scripted the same stuff always happens in like every video
RESPECT FOR THE GUY THAT IS FROM THE JUNGLE REGION DIED FROM CREEPER TO SAVE HIS TEAMMATE
I love when he said "the best- I mean the second best potato farmer"
Pretty much every Civ game I’ve seen, Ize does nothing but plot against anyone trying to build a team while preparing to strong arm his way into power before immediately directing his entire team (whom he constantly berates as weak during the leadership debates) into initiating wars they aren’t prepared for/willing to fight, usually having to cull his own “disloyal” teammates and weakening himself in the process… it’s a good reminder that nobody succeeds alone. A leader is only as good as their team, and a team only as strong as their leader. I actively enjoy watching Ize… only because he’s a perfect example of how strongmen in power are destined to fail, and a perfect villain to scheme and plot his way to having victory in his grasp only to lose it to players who worked together and managed to get along.
Ize was the reason the jungle kingdom lost
i cant be in the video bc i dont have twitter with means i have a life
jungle biome
these minecraft civ videos are so awesome, and is so enjoyable to watch, i didn't think how enjoyable that they'd actually be but the combo of the awesome idea, your calming voice, and the format of the video is a great watch. This is my third video of yours and i am for sure gonna continue to watch, thank you so much for the videos and keep up the good work.
Huh, squid kid.... I still remember the Potato Wars, good times, we miss you Techno.
In Sweden and bye Sweden
Lol usurpers are bitches
Ngl ize is just annoying at this point, i get it he’s meant to be a villain or to cause a inner war but it gets so annoying when its the same degenerate bozo, it really just starts to feel like the guy is causing conflict just for the sake of it, maybe if he was smart he would understand that executing his men because they dont want him to be leader is dumb, you can have ize be a war commander and  there still be a king. “ i got an enchantment table” wow, mining 2 diamonds and getting a book, anyone can do that for themselves in day 1. Its about sharing with others oh wait he can’t do that because the bozo ize keeps losing and whinning, his lost against the dwarfs was honestly just showing how bad he is with tactics, if i were playing i’d KOS ize the first chance i’d get.
Justice for startkiller
get ize out of this series, hes ruining litteraly everything and only thinks about himself with his narcissist personallity... very happy the desert people won
woooo genshiiin impact
I realy hate ize___ cuz of his ruthual temptation of he's town and his people all he thinks is power little didint he know being a king must take big reposibilty but this guy blow the thing up better vote of star next time
Ize did nice he killed the most players. Definitely more then star killer would have
Bro said umm? no
Great squid kid reference to the potato wat
Ize vs Airokun for the crown of who is most annoying a civilization event
I get that it is for content but Ize makes me so mad
Local Abstract too angry to die, chases genocidal King down in his zombified form
I wanna play Minecraft but my storage says no
I can hear Ize sweating
######
I love how the desert nation just wanted peace.
F##k  jungle
If you play genshin impact you're gay
good lord ize is playing the antagonist role so well its so unbearable 😂😂 awesome job
pls stop letting ize playing these games he’s so horrible and unbareable to watch … pls 😅
Bro ize is such a prick. He always talks down to people and acts like he's the greatest thing ever.
I very much dislike IZE
Bro ize acts like a dictator, dude wanted to kill people that mentioned starkiller and when someone was like “yo don’t go” he was like “omg omg I’m done I’m don’t I’m gonna kill them” like stfu bruh. Dude wanted to rush and forced half his team to go when they had iron on like what??
I remember squid kid he was the best
LETS GO ABSTREKT ZOMBIE
Gosh Starkiller needs to be king, I want to see his tactics and if they're "awful" like Ize thinks they are. Man just let someone else be king, you keep doing this and keep losing
I know squid kid isn’t the 2nd best potato farmer anymore 😢
so is no body going to realize he's playing genshin music
Ize and squidkid are hilarious lol but ize do got a lot of dick riders 🤣
His ambition too high
Sow
please no more ize or saitama
im suprised. usualy star is the most popular candidate and is killed by ize  edit:just saw star get killed.why do they always kill star
I can’t stand Ize
weird how ize takes control of every civilisation that he's in and ALWAYS fails
The thing about Ize is that he may be a rude tyrant but he always almost leads his nation to victory. Key word almost as he seems to have the right idea but is too aggressive.
36:41
Artic was my fav
Bro size is like the worst leader in every civilization
I feel so bad for Starkiller in these videos because despite how good of a leader he is he is always killed by Ize
“He’s just shouting over everything anyone says”  Ummm
Ize honestly one of the worlds biggest dictators
I wish I could be in this but I’m bedrock and my Java is laggy 😭😭😭😭 so I’d be dead weight and I’m Java noob
why does everybody hate ize like whats up with that, he played the character of the villain so well, cocky, vain, greedy, hungry for power, stacked and stuff like that and yet all of you guys living in a fantasy just want it to be sunshine rainbows and unicorns whereas ize makes the whole thing interesting to watch, if starkiller got elected then it would have been a lot more boring cause nothing would happen but the war thing got me exited for what would happen even if ize lost it still made the whole thing intersting colorful and fun idk about you but without ize the whole thing would be very boring and if you don't agree with me suck chungledors 3 incher cause you're wrong, did ize make mistakes? Yes he attacked to early and didn't get his team geared up enough but still he was what made any part of this video fun, plus hes irish so...
you didnt need to remind me of techno 2:20
at 7:15 was the funniest BAHAHAHAHH "Guys i have a gift for whomever's a warrior." everyone:: Im a warrior! Im a warrior! Im a warrior! Im a warrior!" XDDDDDDDDD
The jungle nation destroying the Arctic nation and dying seems kind of familiar
I wish the ice kingdom win
If I was you silver I would ban Ize and snap his neck and balls and make starkiller and Ize  is always going solo Im getting a headache on his voice I would do anything just to kill him and beat the living demon inside him
A Silver will never turn to gold
Ize is a kid Thats been abandoned  by his parents his mother even wants to replace him to a cat
Ize’s voice is the worst voice in history of man
I'm just gonna assume that Ize has been scripted to always act like that. That's the only reasonable explanation.
does ize kill starkiller all the time? options:             yes : yes
21:15 rip lol they were so peaceful
9:03 lmao
I support desert who even want a zombie member jungle would kill it right away
Squid Kid literally farm potatoes
ize was cool
A player cheated and went over the barrier blocks and stole gold and iron from desert team just wanted to tell you about it make the wall higher
Artic
Gosh it’s been 7 months but I noticed that two diamond blocks were placed then mined up as if they were already there
If im ever in one of these videos ill just give up if i see ize there
i liked the artic kingdom
W ize that starkkiller is so annoying always saying “you did such a good job guys” to forced fir me
I’m so glad desert won
i liked the arctic kingdom most
The animations seem official
Ize and squid kid and ivictable and star killer are in one of ur next vids! Also great vid as always❤
The fallen miner of the desert kingdom first attacking Ize and breaking his focus, then killing the last Jungle soldier is just the cherry on top.
Jungle need to fight and honor there country😂😂
The time and effort to pull this video off is just remarkable the content is top notch always💯💯always gonna be a fan
ive watched this like a 1,000 times and it came out on my bday ;)
Kill ice
i saw one punch man
WTF ize is the worst baby ever
IZE is actually terrible at the video game, he always stages a coup and it backfires every single time because he’s trash lmaoooo
abstrekt mvp
Ize is like one of the most hateful and greety players i think i've ever heard.
Jungle was best
I like world hunger
If people weren't being stupid and selfish like that guy who defected, they could've won. I really don't understand some people. You literally won an invasion due to your 'cocky' king and earned another crown yet you still defected and tryed to defect while dying like how stupid can you be? Ize da goat, he's just better
Im suprised that Arctic didnt win that build contest :V
Make a ark civilization
I like how the zombie kept his armor lol
I’m a huge fan and I really like your videos that you made. 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤😊😊
Ize is actually annoying and rude. He needs to stop being a brat.
Ice
The story of the Jungle Kingdom is honestly quite sad to me, from the guy who opposed their dictator but ended up getting killed when trying to switch sides to the cow man who was slain in a battle he likely didn't want to be a part of in the first place. The entire kingdom was turned from a relatively tranquil society into a bloodthirsty army thanks to a leader that would've likely been better as a general.
Ize i so fknn CRINGE!
nice video bro
Ize is a tyrant a poor leader
Ize always demands to be king, always turns everything into a fight and always gets everyone killed.
1:43 it's the mandolorian
At 27:40 ize was way to controlling, he could have just asked why but he just forced 9 more people into there death
People like ize are the reason wars happen
POV: you type in duaolingo and you put god is greatest and it’s pakaistan and then it shows…ALAKBAR
bruh ize is just sooo annoying
Squid kid is well experienced in war
Would be fun to have the airdrops inverted once, like the winners get the worse stuff (+ tnt explosions, ravagers or other mobs). Just to equalize and/or seminate chaos a bit
Jungle
I hate the jungle king
The main question is: What if StarKiller became the king of jungle and not Ize? Would they have won?
My Head-canon:  Ize: Whew! that was close Suep, thx for saving my ass. Suep: Oh! no probs. Oh shit get down they found us already! *Ize turns around, getting ready to dig*  Ize: Uuughhh!!! *Ize sees the sword sticking out of his chest* Suep: That! was for his majesty!!! Long live the Arctic Kingdom!~~~ Ize: Ah fuu-- *neck is slit*
I liked Dessert.
watching this after the death of techno made me tear when Silver said the squid kid second biggest potato farmer
ACTUALLY ARCTIC IS COOLLLLL
Guys I love Ize stop the hate
Interesting video with awesome ideas. You're amazing, Silver. I did like the Desert civilization the most
Genshin impact is nice game and it have great succes but THIS IS ACTUALLY 12 GB'S so not that great for laptops
I'm sorry but Ize's character is annoying
Anyone else notice the super mario bros wii desert music playin?
pls make more content about this,love your vids!!
This video is literally Animal Farm.
Hiii
To everyone hating on Ize: he’s the reason the story was interesting, every story needs conflict and it made the video way more enjoyable
I love the ending
Led by the best potato farmer, sorry read that wrong second best potato farmer  *Laughs in Technoblade*
Can u make more civilization vids
It is pathetic that at the start a desert player died
I chose the desert one because it’s remind me one of my first Minecraft adventure when I build my base in a desert
Starkiller sucks
Ize needs to be banned from these videos
Some of these guys are just plain rude, and it makes me think just why are they even there?
Jungle nation was the best
I like when it's the building song
14:51 amogus   38:15 zombie husk on the loose
Damn Ize just hates star
Ize seems so annoying lmao
That squid kid potato joke was so good.   Rip Techno
Starkiller would have united all of the nations in peace      ALSO WHY IS IZE  ON STAR'S TEAM MOST OF THE TIME ?!?!
Lmaoooo squid kid will never be number 1😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
So glad Jungle lost!
Ize and Saitama are just a power hungry and blood hungry pricks they shout over everyone and makes the same statements and when they don't have their way they cause a rebellion and forces their own civilizations into chaos all because they wanted to be leader
Man violated squid kid
Silver: *promotes genshin impact* Idiots: fatherless + ratio 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
You really made my day I really like kingdom building genre, I really hope you will still keep making this kind of content
i wish star killer lead the jungle   i was rooting for them
that girl from the arctic talking too much
I thought artic village was the best
seeing ize lose and cry for it is extremely satisfying
i was with the desert kingdom
I dislike Izze very much.
Atleast it’s not raid shadow legends
THE GENSHIN OST
I hope silver is had 10,000 subscriber
Can i join the civilization
Ize is worst player in this series
Bro making ize a king is worst decision to do
Welcome to another episode of it's Ize and Saitama's world and we just live in it
Genshin is a bad ripoff of Zelda botw
I liked the snow civilization most
Imo arctic had the best village when you guys voted
How did you make the character options for Farmer, Miner and Warrior? It looks a bit like the Origins mod, but I can't figure the rest out
Why does silver sound like the “Number fifteen Burger King foot lettuce”
ize is just a L, he's like a child when he doesn't get his way he screams
MORE OF THESE VIDEOS
Lmao the zombie almost killing the Jungle king and killing the new one was just so funny 💀💀 Like Ize convincing everyone he has good pvp skills and then getting attacked by a single zombie 🤡
Lmao the zombie almost killing the Jungle king and killing the new one was just so funny 💀💀 Like Ize convincing everyone he has good pvp skills and then getting attacked by a single zombie 🤡
I love the way you used genshin music in the video
I was hoping the jungle team wipe out the artic team then share the loot regroup and finish desert
Silver: "And in first place is,JUNGLE REGION! and second is DESERT REGION!"  Me:*screaming in pain* GOD F(beeping) DANGIT
So many people dont even know how to combat a ravanger. that ravanger drop in the arctic town destroyed them. all you need to do is block, swipe, repeat with a shield and an axe.
Chaos go brrrrr
i really dont like this ize guy
I like how every team ize is in he makes himself leader and gets them all killed.
After watching these videos, I've learned that any team that has Ize on it, should immediately kill him. Otherwise you're just gonna have teamkilling and revolting every time.
Mario Bros music is just exelent
Ize is so annoying, he always brings good people like starkiller down, it's just sad
hello I'm new here
I CHOSW DESERTS AND DESERTS WIN DESWRTS BESTTT YEAAAA
Communism sucks
Squid kid is the best now but at what.
Ize wasn't a good king he also genuinely argued with people in an event that was supposed to be fun always kill ize first
Ize, the tyrant.   Yharon, The Jungle Dragon Tyrant    I see something here
5:08 why is he eating bucket
the way ize speaks gives me heartburn
That irish lad is exellent,
Hail jungle
arctic
You having challenges as a trending thing you do is nice but how much mods you have in the bag is super cool
Artic
Ize is like that playground bully who sees all the other kids having fun, then pushes them around and teases them until they follow him out of pure fear lol. Man's insufferable smh
Star Killer would have made a much better leader
No offence but The jungle leader is a crap leader who is the worst person to ever play Minecraft
I loved desert 😁 because of their Statue 🗿🗿
I liked the jungle best
note to self: get rid of ize early
Bro ize is a fucking god
Artic Was Supposed To Be The Best But It Was Actually      Abstact The Zombie
well squid kid is the best potato farmer in minecraft, if you know what i mean XD
The most well made videos on youtube
reading the comments seeing a lot of shit about Ize. Ngl i fucking love that guy, he's tactics are funny as fuck and i'm always rooting for him. Think i might apply for the next one so i can join his team
I like the fact that you use Genshin impact music
If you ask me Ize was the jungle’s downfall due to his demand for leadership.
2:22 but it's true though :<
I like hardcore!
Ice kingdom was the best!!!
now im rootin for the desert
*Oh genshin impact hell yea baby* got me😂😂😂😂😂
I tought jungle was gonna win
Nice ize___ never deserved that win cause he is a lost cause oh humanity
I liked the winter kingdom
What are your last words: I had a cow 😆
while cool, i think something like the closed map experiment would be far more interesting. Pure Vanilla No hostile mobs up to the players' mind what is fair or not.  but expanded,
Ize and saitama are bad they always kill starkiller
5:01 Inevitability literally pulled a “GET DOWN MR. PRESIDENT!!!”
IZE is a freaking jerk! Oh my gosh!
It was really cool but the least characterized team won that’s the only major flaw
Is this a mood
if i play one of these events im killing ize instantly, that guys an ass
I like how my cousin died first and never told me about it
Dang the jungle lost
Ize is more of a lone warrior survivor type. He prepares things mostly for himself, and shares when it benefits him. Good individual combat sense, but it doesn't translate in a group combat setting. Rather than damaging the faction by forcing leadership, maybe Ize could adapt by leading a combat focused squad that has authority for independent military action. They could on recon in force, perform precision hit and run tactics and help the faction on making military decisions. I just noticed that he doesn't really inspire people to follow him. And when he is in a position of power, he often rushes the attack regardless of the faction's overall combat power and willingness, which may work in times when a swift strike is needed.
I like the desert
Bro, When silver revealed the sponsor, i quickly skipped it, Cuz the game is for predators.
38:40
I see what you did with sqiud  kid
Ize always starts problems smh
People: work hard to make town Town: gets third place which gets the worst supply drop *ravager spawns and kill 3 innocents* Silver: Sorry, It made good content though Town: Furious
I felt bad for artic when the ravager spawned, artic is so innocent :(( I thought artic would at least get second!
Moreeee
Why is it always three teams?
it’s all fun and games till someone throws a strength and speed pot at the zombie
Awesome.
Ize is so annoying you should ban him
35:53 GOSH
Who the hell is lze?
"I Can Feel Power"
Im kinda mad the artic got last in the build comp. They def had the better build and it was at least better than deserts.
The arctic should of won
Nah bro why they elect Conor McGregor as king
A shame about the jungle kingdom
The irish guy is so annoying
The last part was so good bro nice plot twists
this should’ve been an SMP lol
The potato war reference was a pinch in my heart rip technoblade
The artic had the best town
Ize is one of those toxic players lol I would've killed him as soon as I enter the world 🤣🤣
Do you build these yourself?
I really want to see an attack on titan escape from island video...
If Andrew Tate played Minecraft
I don't get it. Why do they have to kill Starkiller when he already gave Ize the crown
I love how Starkiller is the perfect politician.
Ize is the guy who no one wants to play with. Even though they now he's good the way he plays just pisses everyone off
Ize us such a weenie
*Second Best Minecraft Potato Farmer* Who was/is the first?
we hate iez
Why did you invite technoblades Skyblock enemy squid kid
Personally, I was routing for arctic simply because of their sheer determination
I liked jungles ruthlessness
"don't think just kill" xD
I've always wanted to play but I'm not gonna join if Ize is gonna act like he's better than everyone
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I know I'm a little late, but seriously, Ize is completely killing the fun in this video with his toxicity
Does anyone else hate ize with a burning passion so strong you want to punch him, he’s so loud and forceful and doesn’t join with them until benefits are included and he doesn’t go for the role play
ngl I was rooting for arctic, I'm not an among us fan but their determination was awesome
Really dislike Ize.
Te fact that this video was made after i quit AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA grew to hate Genshin sucks
i was rooting for jungle
This Ize guy is so unpleasant lol
Am I the only one that thinks their base ranking should be the opposite? The arctic definitely had the base base
No squid kid
Ize lacks strategy and patience which is why he keeps losing. If he would listen and respect his team instead of treating them like expendable lawns he might start winning more often
we love starkiller <3
ize is a freaking comunist
i like the power that ize brings
does it have to be ize!! I just hate him so much!!, he's so rude and ruins every video!! **** him!
Ize be lowkey pissing me off bruh
you dont vote for kings....
They just die heros like star killer in the war
Gonna be a dead ass farmvill series without icz!! Looking forward for more content with him in it
So sad they killed star killer on the medival world by being a good leader
gUYS WHO WOULD LIKE IT IF THEY MADE ON OF 4 TEAMS EACH 25 PLAYERS AND 25 PLAYERS BUT LIKE PRE MADE OWN TEAM AND STUFF NOT RANDOM.
Ize and Saitama ks that their masyer manipulators and act good at the game like tour the one to talk
if technoblade never died he would replace squid kid
The Super Mario music in background is so cool
pls make more like this
2:00 mario kart music started playing!
ize makes my skin crawl
23:15 but that’s exactly what Ize does?
definitely desert
2:23 second yep the best one is.. oh.. sorry :(
15:10 most based zombie ever
I hate Ize he's a tyrannical prick and the guy who assassinated starkiller is the same, starkiller posed no threat to the throne and only would've opposed their extreme ideas probably for the better
Well then...I guess Squid kid is now the best potato farmer
Power with out great leadership is a fast way to lose your people
notice ives and stamina always plan to assasinate starkiller... i mean really, what did he do?  hes trying to bring peace and unity, all while these people who steal loot, kill the only cow, and mined by themselves while the rest of the civilization battled the events are like "we are the best ruler"   i mean i get some people prefer a militaristic civilization but i think everyone working together would be the best    also the poor jungle player soup killed.  they hated their leader, and then it turns out their leader was better than trying to defect to desert- i mean they also may have had some valuable info but yeah, poor guy
I love this!
Love this content, war!
I hate the desert
Ize is a legend i see him in every thing and he always takes over
I think the Arctic one because of their personality
Tbh I first liked the Jungle Civilization, but when ize becomes king, I switched to desert then hoped for them to win. Congrats Desert!!
I'm surprised nobody gets intel before attacking. Do they know the final event is war? I would booby trap the area and keep underground inviting invaders in.
No now he is the best potato farmer😢
It's funny how most of the time he puts ize and 5aitama together
How does Ize manage to be the villain in these EVERY time
Fr hated the jungles king so much bro fr cocky as hell so glad he died
Jungle based af
I have an idea that will probably make this more interesting Zombies!  If someone from a civilization dies then they become a zombie but if they get 5 kills from there civilization they become human again
whatever it is jungle are meant to lose the fight from the starts. both leadership from ize and star is not really gonna suffice. since one has a peaceful leadership but lacks on gear. ize just lacks good leadership and his strategy is dumb. but thats ok its just a game afterall
Downfall always begins when a starscream takes the throne.
Man if Ize and Starkiller would team up they'd be incredible. Starkillers organization of the town and getting then that town building reward was big! Ize could be coordinating with other miners to get even more diamonds would've been huge. But we know Ize loves his greedy power plays.
Ize and Starkiller on the same team just seems to breed chaos 🤣
Bruh ize and 5aitama are the most unlikeable people in these videos 😂
wanted arctic to win
this guy ize has the same 3 lines acting like such a d
Ize takes the fun out of every clip he’s in. He talks so much but never has anything original to say
jungle
so happy to see ize losing
When I heard ‘lead by the best potato farmer, wait no… SECOND best potato farmer, squid kid’ I laughed soo hard
Am I the only one that as soon as I hear starkiller I think starkiller from StarWars
That ize guy seems a nice dude to hang around, he probably has a lot of friends  /S
Dat zombie carries
jungle
BOO I HATE THIS VIDEO BOOOO BC JUNGLE LOSTTTTTTT
You should make the mods gods who can give boons if they are appeased or worshiped or something
Unfair, desert and jungle got crappy villagers than ice got a mountain temple
yo i subscibed
That dick head ize always kills guys on his team kills a good leader and fucks it up leaves his team joins another and gets his entire civilization killed and still loses he ruins the fuckin videos. The character he's playi g is just getting boring 😴
Ize definitely has never felt the touch of a woman
Jungle sucks
This is like reality TV 😂
Ize is way to cocky I kinda hate him
Why genishin impact add😔
I kinda think jungle would of won with the other leader who was assassinated
im_a_squid_kid, when he got called the second best potato farmer hits different now
I Play Genshin From December 2021 AR 50 Rn
I was happy when Ize died knowing he led his army to death
I like jungle
Waffling lol
All these 100 player videos seem to be basically the same. Starkiller gets assassinated, Ize and Saitama are never team players and just cause a bunch of meaningless havoc. I kind of wish you would do future videos with different players
Personally, I wouldn't let Ize and Saitama play after the civilization videos ive seen but...apparently thats just me🤷🏻‍♀️
Ize is the one who insults everyone and  becomes extremely mad when people insult him
If there is another one I would PAY a group to kill ize as soon as pvp is enabled
ize is so unlikeble
Ize may be headstrong and attack any political opponents to gain the leadership role. But his dedication to a tyrant role is still pretty great for entertainment purposes and makes for interesting situations, which is what this series is great for
Ize is unironically my favorite “character” in this civilization saga
24:02
Motion to give Ize, Saitama, and other continuously toxic players debuffs at the start of each game.
haha techno remains the best lol
English ar you
That zombie payed off a bit near the end Lol this was am amazing video
🌈🤡
The ice kindom is the best and the best at team speeret
i've watched a few of these... ize seems to be the trouble maker
Ize is one of those annoying people you just wanna punch irl lol
#stopyoutubescammers
This is almost like ww2, with the artic as France, jungle as germany and desert as the Soviet. As the artic got completely wrecked due to the superior tech of the jungle and their disorganization , the deserts got pushed back initially but eventually beat the jungle due to their leader’s impatience, and cockiness. Had they regroup and further armed themselves after the artic invasion they would have had a much better chance of winning
the arctic team had the best town centre by far
I subscribe your cool really really coooool
ize got that negative charisma
Ize is annoying my god he talks up his game so much and proceeds to get clapped every time just because he mines for diamonds off the rip like get over yourself
Get izze out
i don't understand why ize was able to recruit more people by force. wouldn't he be outnumbered? was his gear that much better?
6:45 Christopher Columbus when seeing the natives
This ize guy thinking he all that
Long live Ize
God Ize suuuuuuuucks
Ize is very toxic
I hate ezi he's just fortnite kid who doesn't play fortnite
At first I was like Jungle is the nicest area, then the mean guy became king and made them all fight for him and I was like, "Okay jungle is the worst" then Soup escaped and was still  looking at Arctic victory, and I was like oh yea Arctic is the way, and then he tried to help the guy who was the whole reason his side lost, and I realized. Desert is the only good option. Then they won.
If I were to be in one if these events and see that Ize is on my team, he will be the first death in the event.
It's an ok vid take ize out and it'll be amazing
The desert
I liked Arctic most
he love super mario bros
Goated ass vids on God, I cant stop watching them. Keep on being this way daddy.
I’m glad you corrected yourself calling squid the 2nd best potato farmer
These videos are the best please make more I love   them 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
technoblade is the best potato farmer 😭
Schneziah (Idk how to spell it) Sumeru, and mondstat😭
ize's character is sooo good honestly, like he actually makes me feel angry, which he is also tryna do. very good!
Why does he script them so hard? He literally gives ize all the information and loot
even after having the worst seed the desert they won with 12 players (including zombie)
Jungle would have won if they had all rallied with their new king
You should do one of these with the create mod
"wait i read that wrong.. second best potato farmer" LMFAOO
Ize:”I have combat experience what does he have?”  Also ize:relies on backstabbing and manipulation to win battles
Ize is horrible at military strategizing
What were they gaining from killing StarKiller that means one less loyal troop that could help them win and he would be able to stop them from starving
14:23 that’s just how it goes, they elect the most charismatic person that lays around and does hardly anything instead of electing the person that was hard working the entire time... then when he comes back they disrespect him and demanding to use his shi like there straight up feening... they demand for his shi as there straight disrespectful and telling him not he can’t even elect himself while there legit using his enchantment table... that’s why he hid it before because he knows people are gonna be stupid and just go with charismatic over hard work so even if he lets them use his shi there just gonna stay disrespectful and not be greatful at all, he shoulda said he used an Advil to his enchant his amour after finding enchanted books, or say I will allow you to use my enchantment table and diamonds if you respect me and I promise I’ll give them after I win, never give the shi for free cause they will act like pricks
They do realize they don’t have to make the “king” their actual ruler.
That Jungle king was wayyy too arrogant and I was actively hoping he would die. So happy he got murdered in the end.
The Arctic Empire
Ize is just such a hateable villain. He just seems like a massive prick that is just so narcissistic and cocky
All of your music is Mario maker bro!!!!!!!
Ize is such a massive bellend 😂
I think you judged the ice nation unfairly their village was really good
Give star killer a different team without Ize
It's sad now that techno is in heaven, Squid is the best potato farmer by default.
We gotta appreciate Ize a bit here for playing somewhat of a villain role making the whole thing a lot more enjoyable
At 37:27 the person on the left has her eyes closed
So kids what did we learn from today’s video?   Just because you give someone something doesn’t mean they’re in your debt. There’s a reason Ize’s subtitles were red.
Bro I hate izee
How did the arctic lose the village competition
The Fact That The Jungle King Mocked Star About Staying At The Base Eating Carrots While The Others Fought, And That's Exactly What The Desert Team Did And Still Won
abstract is the real king
Ize is kinda annoying tbh
Ize used fear and power to control the jungle people and for Star he was A great leader he shared his resources and lead the jungle until Ize came along..
Ize is honestly really selfish
I feel that the arctic shoulda won the supply drop vote for best civilization, they had culture and a beautiful town. I mean at least the shoulda gotten second place jungle just had a scraped together town with a dirt monkey with bad political problems
the ize kid completely ruined the vibe, power grabbing kid. ruined the entire of the jungle part for me
Honestly, I genuinely hate ize in these videos
The editing in these videos is SO GOOD
ize is so god damn annoying every clip he’s in just makes me feel rage
Jungle
Makes me even sadder that I lost my minecraft account knowing I'm missing out on something this fun
I love these vids
15:13 Background: MPMHPHMHPHMMHMHMHMHMPPPP
The fact that ize was probably the most unintelligent person of them all, Tickle's me
The squid kid comment was awesome
fuck genshin impact
Bro winter civilization got robbed
Starkiller is always assassinated in these videos and it's always sad.
Best paptop farmer now rip tecno
These feel really scripted
Can console play aswell
Ize makes me so pissed
i stg ize is a terrible leader
Why are there always so mean people in this simulations, comeone, that doesnt seem fair at all star was with his people the whole time helpt them lead them while ize was sitting in the caves and mined stuff, that he didnt even share with its people. Where is that even close to be fair. Than the coward who was sitting in the mines and only mined stuff becomes still ther king just because of its gear? What BS is that.. he also reached his goal in becoming King and star get still killed. IZE is really the bigges coward on earth and takes out the fun of nearly every single one of this series....
You can tell Ize is just a straight up sweat and a dictator in the making.
I like the civilization idea but why not take it 1 step further and make it straight up evolution like in the beginning they have to start with nothing but dirt, then wood then stone, iron ect. And instead of teams call them tribes.
People talking about how liz shouldn't have been king but attacking was way better then sitting waiting to die....
Jungle
I love how ize and saitama just have to become leaders but I think there smart tho trying to take out the leadership
Ize makes this hard to watch he just makes everyone dies poor jungle
gentian impact player why don’t you go touch some grass what’s up in six years😂😂😂🤣
I think the idea for the jungle nation was really good but like they fell apart
what person with a functional Brain accepts a genshin impact sponser
rip techno btw now spuid kid the best
"While the innocent people begin fighting for their lives, starving through the night and barely having anything to defend themselves, I'd like to talk about today sponsor."
Ize  is  a  stupid  king
You need to do this again!! This was great
i hate ize
Mean jungles
I like forest
Anyone else dislike Ize?
hi i love your vids if this is a mod where can i get it?
that was great... really great
Silver has actually made me addicted to Genshin Impact Tysvm for the addiction
lemme just state the fact that Ize be like make me king or else we’re not going to win…  yet when he’s king THEY LOSE
“Honestly I liked the guy but good thing that he died “ - Jungle man 🤣🤣
I liked a the artic but the jungle uhhh image them watching these a realized they where fooled like wow the jungle are moronic as hell
These never get boring please keep it up it’s so fun to watch
Ize sucks bruh
I love how the Mario music matches the enviroment at the start
It's always ize bro 🤦‍♂️😂
Man izz hates starkiller
Bro Izzy is dumb ngl
Everone hates Ize and they are right, he was so cocky and annoying and Starkiller would have made a better king
Why is the link is not working
this guy ize needs a reality check bro
Get rid of ize he is just annoying and a fun sucker
The person who said. Genshin impact hell yeah baby and he appears out of nowhere
the og mario music 😔
damn the music fits
You should do anathore one with giants and that
But mr ass kisser is also equally annoying
IZE is the worst person so annoying he’s the type you just drop kick in lava cause he ruins everything
ayo chungledore sounds like he's a game of thrones character
Keep up the good work you are doin awesome
and silver keep on doing these videos there are awesome I really only watch these kind of mincraft videos and 100 days because they can be fun to watch
I loved the jungle mostly because I like war and they were really good to
2:22 LOLLLL
I don't like Ize.
I feel like the first person u should always kill is iz and saitama theyre such try hards and always kill anyone who gets in there way if i wanted to be king i would kill em of the bat even if theyre on my team
Ize was way too aggressive, only focusing on attacking and developing in the early stages, also completely overlooking the weaker players and their (could've been) advantage of number and resources. Starkiller was way too calm, he would've held the teams number together, but wouldn't be able to keep their spirit up, that would lead to a great disadvantage and lead to their defeat.
If Starkiller and Ize worked together they would've definitely won. With Ize's combat skills, aggressive, straight forward personality and Starkillers more reserved, mature personality and natural leadership. They could've made 2 elite teams specializing in defense and offense ultimately becoming the most powerful nation.
I liker jungle the most
silv: say squid_kid's the 2nd best potato farmr in mc me: no it's in hypixel skyblock     edit: RIP Technoblade
Yooo xnestorio joined the game
Banned who killed starkiller for 100 years
hehe...squid got dunked on
Ize keeps ruining the kingdoms he's put in, he trys to ruin the jungle civilization, then he succeeded in ruining the giants
Honestly the ice civilization had the best village
nah, bad Commander
NO NOT GENSHIN PLEASE thye gave me a gacha addiction and emptied my wallet :
Silver please dont invite ize to the next civilization gmae
why is ize annoying
Ize: "I have much more experience in a fight" Also Ize: *cries when cornered*
ize honestly makes ur vids unenjoyable to watch
I hate how power hungry ize is
I love the fact that he said squid kid was the second best potato farmer in minecraft
Everytime i see ize in a kingdom, i just skip because of his yackin
Hi
i likes arctic i thought jungle was good but there really mean i liked deserts teamwork to
i dont like ize :C
Artic is hilarious
Ize takes it so serious and it is so annoying
Just a total copy of other Minecraft smp YouTubers
I was team artic
I do not like Ize
If I was in this I would have eliminated ize from the start
rip technoblade
2:21 When you realize that i_am_a_squid_kid is the best potato farmer in Minecraft now Rest In Peace Techno.
I've never seen someone ruin a game so much as Ize. I feel bad for the jungle team having to listen to his insane ramblings
hi silver
i can just imagine that ize guy being a 40 year old irish dad and he’s arguing with the kids
Ize litteraly is one of the WORST leaders ive seen
Dude this Ize guy is NOT a team player. Dude comes off very selfish by leaving to go get stacked while everyone works as a team building, then comes back like "WeLllll GUEsss I"m KINNNnng now....."
Bro istg please get ize out of your videos he keeps ruining everything and making these videos boring
I kinda think the Jungle king was kinda dumb
Ize is a bully and a entitled snooze
IZE is awful lol what a sweaty nerd.
Without ize these videos wouldnt be as entertaining so whatever lol
I have help children i my basement so they wil simulate a civilian
Bro how did the arctic civilization get last in the town building they had a fricking among us statue
uwu
Ganeshan impact is retarded
👀
I was not rooting for any of them but I was not definitely rooting for the jungle there leader is too cocky
25:05 “one guy gets caught off guard by a creeper” 🧐
Ize has to be the most annoying person ever
“WOOO, I CAN FEEL THE POWWERR” -Some random person
I mean desert was just chilling and jungle was litrally fighting with ice so I knew they will lose
It was the victory for abstrekt the zombie
I was routing for the jungle team
Ize is so toxic.
ize sucks
Man maid 5 videos in 5 months
No squid is the best potato farmer
that was insane a super solid watch so much betrayal. the jungle king and soup got what they deserved. RIP star killer lol
I really wanted dessert to win
Ize is trash ew
i love how abstrekt's zombie played a role in this
I was rooting for the desert team 🏜️
ur brutal
jungle kingdom was easily the worst
Next Jungle Kingdom Need The Throne Next To The Panda Home to Honor Them...
We pove you man
love the genshin music in background
The Arctic village was by far the best i don't get how it finished at the 3rd place
ize makes me want to be a mojang admin, just to ban him
Stop letting I’ve play he’s horrible
The zombie teammate was like paying it's debt to his teammate for sticking with him until the end even tho he's a walking corpse
love the mario music
Instead of invading arctic. I would've offered an alliance to take out desert. With luck, arctic numbers would've dropped further setting them up for their down in the end. With desert out of the way. Arctic with fewer player would be done for. xD
That jungle traitor deserved that tbh
Nah I think the artic civilisation should have won the vote (got 1st)
Had I been in this one I would have assasinated ize as soon as I could, possibly with end crystals
”Yo guys I’m gonna elect myself king, sound good?” Speech 100
the jungle is my typa party
Plz don't have Ize in the next civilization
snow is the besd
Ize is a soab. Bad characther
The desert king's reaction to the arctic's situation was amazing  "And you killed none of them? ....gosh"
Jungle civil is have the worst king ever at invansion time because he force every single people to war with him and invasion other civil
TOUCH GRASS BRO
i like ize. i understand this is a minecraft video and has a certain viewer selection, but no way y’all are that soft
Ize and 5aitama always be teaming up again
i loved green just not the 2 leader he was rood so green green green GO GREEN
Ize sucks all the damn life and fun out of any clip he’s in fr the most toxic person I see in this stuff
genshin impact sucks cuz anime sucks (Except The Pokemon Anime
Ize really does make the divide interesting in the videos but it's pretty toxic.
Can't quiet put my finger on the music song, but idk if it's copyrighted or not
Ize is a minecraft Andrew Tate, like bruh... chill
what I've learned about ize  he takes everything like a tournament
Second best potato farmer lol
Fun idea give the best rewards to the civilization doing the worst, but don't tell anyone
Le monke statue got me 😂
hi speedsilver
fuck jungle players!
I wonder what would happen if you plopped Dream in there
This is the Minecraft version of the American revolution. Tundra is the french/natives, Britain is the jungle, and the American colonists are the desert.
"the second best potato farmer" if you know, you know.
That sound track of the dessert at 1:05 is very diddy kong racing
Ngl even if ize is playin a character, his character ruins the mood and doesn’t make the video itself enjoyable.
Ize is my king!
2:20 I like the technoblade reference :)
Ize is such an annoying manchild
Carrot eating starkiller woulda won with peace and carrots.
2:21 the best potato farmer now
How did Nintendo not destroy you for using their music themes?
I was wondering why the music sounded familiar untill I realised I heard it a couple of minutes while killing some hillichurls
Honestly it doesn't make sense to me as to why Ize kept saying that the players in his region would get 2 hit because of their armor and not doing anything about it. Like bro stop getting triggered over the fact that you cant take care of your civilization
“ i had a cow, I had a cow! “
Literally wanna stop watching this cause of ize…
Stop including ize, he's just annoying
Techno’s the best potato farmer even after death
mario music adds a great touch
I don’t have twitch so if it’s possible could you hook me up with a link or someway to get me on ?
I don’t have twitch but I wanna participate could you somehow send me another link somehow or in someway get me on without twitch
My god this Ize dude..... Same old crap....  Tyrant attitude. "Your gonna get 2 hit dude"  I got the best gear all enchanted and all.  Ok 👌 definitely supports you.  But that dont mean you alone is gonna carry the faction.  Being leader means more than having good gear.  Not surprised any team Ize is on its gonna be chaotic.  It's called civilization.  Not pvp tournament kings.  Sure his planning stuff adds spice to the interests but it's boring if it's the same thing to plot and kill, plot and kill. -_-  It's like me saying "hey I got all the best gears in the game." Netherrite armor with best enchants (with the bookcases to double the better enchants)  Pfft. Also his reasons to become king is complete Tyranical he's just asking to get assassined.  Leadership is among the first thing a king needs, dude just leads his people to go die. When he should be focusing on building up for a long term war. Rather play the defense and get everyone's to wear diamond armor enchanted.  Edit: and what did I say? Dude literally threatening his people. Haha he's asking for rebellion.  I'm not surprised the next civilization matches teams he's on would lose again
I would def follow Ize, and I don’t even play Minecraft lmao. BLOOD FOR THE THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!
i completely forgot squidkid was the one who fought technoblade in the great potato war
Seups and Ives last stand was just great
Ize is so aggravating, I know what he’s doing. So much of it is luck based and not fun. Get good gear, kill everyone, win game.
that lazy kind reminds of of whats his name from germany, not wanting to share with anyone
why saitama all times trying to kill starkiller ;D
DONT INVITE IZE he sucks out the fun
It seems like star killer always gets assassinated
Bruh they try killing starkiller every time, give Starkiller a buff bc Ize is a jerk.
Can we stop getting Ize in these videos he's very obnoxious
Yeah the ize guy just wants star dead for the sake of him being dead he got the crown he could've had star alive as another guy on the field but no they killed him anyway
So many of these players just try to run away. The kings could become pushovers if everyone just swarmed them.
جنگ جهانی
The best civilization is the ice civilization. They're one, I mean they don't fight and instead come together to be ready for any challenge they might incounter but unluckily they don't have better armours, weapons and skills for a war that's why almost all of them got eliminated. But luckily the king of the desert accepted their alliance and win over the arrogance king of the jungle civilization. Over all I like the artic civilization, a team where has loyalty, bravery, and truth to each other!!!    -MasK4ra 0.1
2:19 bruh why you gotta do squid like that
Ize is so mean to star
Ize is just so childish and infantile it's hard to watch
saying sus is so cringe
ize gives me single child energy
Size needed to be manipulated into the team...
Despite all the hate for Ize, I think he is  just playing a character.
immediately stopped watching when they started "killing the natives" to get to the loot. like okay sure, if there are like zombies or something guarding it, great! but the way they used a mod and set that all up, knowing full well the history of colonization and genocide, which is very much still relevant today, is frankly disturbing and disgusting. it all screams white ignorance.
lol so much sabotage in the jungle.. if i could i would do exactly those things
Imagine your finale words being “have you ever heard of genshin impact?”
Jungle king is maaaaad annoying😂 glad he died😂
We have to honor the monke 🐒
*shameless promo "Hell yea, genshin impact baby
Ize should stop going by force. He will always lose
Bro the people in the arctic did amazing compared to the sad desert.
Ize and Saitama are always a problem.
Please make another
Imma stop watching these videos just because of Ize. He is seriously so annoing and hungry of power. Sad to see....
YO ABSTREKT ZOMBIE FOR THE CLUTCH ON THE KING
25:05 a creeper? that looks like a phantom to me
Desert all the way. Although ize wasnt bad (in fights), he was a terrible king but not bad at pvp.
i love these videos sub from me
How the jungle win the building thing bro they had the worst lol
Just so you know, squid kid is  the second potato farmer because technoblade is the king of farming potatos
The Desert Kingdom did incredibly well.
Damn i love how the peaceful ones wins
what's the code to join
Ize makes me so mad, he ruins the games for his teammates and he has no proof on what’s against star killer since he always just gets him killed before anything
Me and all my homies hate ize
ize is really making me mad
They totally did not deserve this The jungle was best
Artic>jungle
Jungle should have won
I've only seen two silver Videos but star died to ize more than once now
How can I get potentially added to awesome events like this
StarKiller getting assasinated is just a tradittion at this point
Honestly The Jungle kingdom should’ve Won
I tought jungle kindgdom gonna win bc of their gear. But oh my god I have never expected that.
Mario maker music on start
y ize is kinda dumb he ruins every civ and cant manage a civ
no offence but ize is a plague to every civ he  joins
ize... lived as soldier, died as a soldier. o7
Bro this ice guy is mad annoying “your gunna get 2 hit” the guy just wants to play mc
So what I've learnt from watching these videos is that you should always immediately kill Ize and 5aitama to avoid powergrabs.
I hate Ize. Man literally went through the effort to leave his people in the jungle to wait, just so he could go back to his base & kill someone that was a “traitor” simply because he said “Don’t Go” in chat. He had no clue for the context for why he said that. For all he knew, he said it because he didn’t want them to fight because they were outnumbered.
I was kinda rooting for the tundra
All the other civilizations: What’s your religion? The arctic civilization: GENSHIN IMPACT
I love this! I need more!
I found this channel out only recently but after watching a fair bit of Civilization in Minecraft videos can I just say how I love no one that is tyrannical or deceiptful are competant enough to actually bring it through lmfao its so pathetic.
I liked desert the most, even though jungle was really strong but I didn't like the way they cooperate though forcing eachother
Ize is such a boring player
I liked the jungle civilization, but I don't like Ize
I hated the jungle king
“Why is it that whenever there’s trouble, it’s always you three.” Saitama, Ize, and Supe
ize____ is kinda behaving like Andrew Tate ngl :D :D
Did anybody see the guy in the jungle that died to the creeper tried to punch it away from the others
25:05 he says that the player got caught off guard by a creeper as the player proceeds to die and get caught off guard by a phantom
Ize is kind of a warmonger.
It's like an actual even or war that happened long ago. Beautiful video
I don't like the clips with ize in them please stop adding him to these
Did anyone else see at the start like at 0:10 it said Nesterio and Technoblade joined
Ize  like Saddam Hussein  he kill everyone if he didn't  be a king 🤣
Person: does something once Ize: “I’m over it”
why is ize so annoying
Jungle best ize best
Ize = Unemployed in the IRL, is probably better against the world and thinks it owes him. Wouldn't you know, he lost in a video game, and does so in the flesh lmao
No. Squid Kid is now the number 1 potato.
Desert's were just camping bro🤦🏽‍♂️
Ize is such a bitch hiding an enchantment table from everyone and then being like yo I'm gonna be king...k. he's like golum
Everyone here mad at ize, guys it’s not that deep lmfao
I really don’t like Ize, He’s killing teammates! Honestly, I love the jungle or forest teams but I don’t like how he threatens teammates
Oh wait, starkiller was in another one of the vids! He was my favourite
I play Genshin Impact! And I know how to say the names correctly lol, the names are Chinese themed and I speak Chinese lol
E
E
E
E
E
I am sorry but i hate ize
ize always kills star killer like bruh
Bro arctic had the best town
Ize is literally a trash human "I'm gonna be selfish and get the most OP loot and everyone will vote me" bro seriously grow up, you ain't a leader
The best potato farmer oh wait I mean the second. Dang nasty haha
Arctic team worked beautifully together and they were like family, i love them
YOU WİLL LİVE FOREVER STARKİLLER!
how to participate in this kind of stuff... this is really cool
The editing that you and semit did is insane mad respect
Lol “don’t be persuaded he just has an accent!”
Don't mess with the dwarves guys because that screw you up bro don't mess with the short people!!!!!
🥰👿🌈
Why does people in this video keeps logging of and log on?
Ize is hitler he is good at attacking and destroying but always oversteps and looses at the last second.
Anybody else not able to stand IZE?
And you guys killed NONE of them???  GosH
squid kid
Best minecraft contect ever seen in my life
Bro.. this guy is like the 2nd coming of God or somethin
Not to be rude but I just think that Ize is super annoying.
i like Jungle but after killing StarKiller i dont like them
Not the jungle kingdom turning into russia
Second best potato farmer…. Well he’s now number 1 and I’m sure techno is raging in the afterlife since he’s now lost his title
ize is really annoying
Ize sucks, he’s way to competitive and sucks alas the fun out of it. He only cares for himself and his ego, they should’ve killed him before they got to Starkiller.
Can you just ban Ize from the next event? I know he is just a character and that isn't who he really his, but his character is so unlikeable.
Ize was the reason why the giants lost in the dwarves, elves and giants 100 days video
I like how it's always the same people being important players
Squid kid is now the best potato farmer :(... RIP Techno
I WAS ZYSKO_
i routed for anything with squid kid in it
Honestly desert deserved that win I really liked how they fought
ize is so annoying
Say what you wany about Ize but Starkiller's complacentness would've spelled doom for jungle. If he had bided time peacefully the arctic miners wouldve supplied their army with better gear. Ize was a douche but in war times he's the leader you need.
Bro jungle >> artic and dessert where playing gay
"ive got more battle experience" *drops a  netherite sword in the middle of a fight*
I Love the genshin backround music lol
I am noticing a pattern here, and its always Starkiller that it usually happens to. Starkiller if you are here reading my comment I give you my respect on trying to work as a group I don't get why you get these players that are Greedy or even think "Peace doesn't solve anything" type of deal. For you I bow my head to you as you should be king for most of these.  (Note) To those other people thinking Starkiller is bad.. I don't hate you but stop thinking power means everything its the reason you guys nearly lost or even lost the last few times.  (Making a another note) Whoever he thinks like Power overall is better than leadership this is why some people can slowly but surely stop trusting you. I wont lie your idea's are correct but going against your people is not a leader its corruption. If you want to feel like a king for pvp sake there are other servers for that but overall you did bring your people to downfall not them.
Starkiller stepped down to avoid a civil war and even supported IZE while he still lived. THATS a true hero. IZE seriously takes all the fun in these videos... so does Sitoma, always so traitorous
Jungle
It's nice that the fascist dictator of winter biome died, starkiller deserved leadership, he has better strategy. Democracy always wins.
In all These civilization vids, Theres always a tyrant king. Like, ALWAYS. I love ur video, keep it up
I always wanted to be in a arctic
The plot of all of these  Ize carries his nation everyone else only has iron he calls them out on it they ignore him and they all die   be like Ize get good gear.
Why does always in every civilization video Starkiller gets killed
How do you get in on these games?
congrats on squidd kid for making it to first place potato farmer, but maybe still second. technoblade never dies
*began
5:28 silver killed the cow didn't he
Squid_kid if you know you know
dude ize is legit so annoying, even more so after the medieval video
Dude i love the jungle clan but the king is a nono
Ize is the type of mf to have smoke coming out of his ears when he's mad
this was so epic dude
Ize just ruins this for me to be honest.
When the cow was killed I thought it was like beef team 6 all over again
Abstract ftw bro
I like how ize said under the lead of starkiller the jungle would lose and then they lose anyway and the people who did what starkiller probably would have done won.
You know I watched you grow big when i started watching you had 4k subs
Arrogance is the false intellect of the fool - Sun Tzu
Why are people hating on Ize? He was easily the most entertaining and he was able to build a really good army and invade rather sitting and waiting for people to come to him.
Ew honestly get Ize outta here he's so frustrating, character or not jesus.
Everyone remembers squid kid from the legendary potato wars from technoblade
ayo xbox people DM me @ Syther69 its not the full name but my pfp is master chief. i want at least 12 people for a 6v6 on a survival world. (when you die ill give creative to you so you can watch the rest of the battles)
So from watching a bit of these ...Saitama and Ize seem to be general egotistical assholes just taking all the good stuff for themselves fucking over their own teams and teamkilling the actually useful people..
Im just saying Ize killed the content
ize is a tiny bit dumb and bossy i will agree that not giving up is good idea but when you have 4 members vs 13 members i woud pull back brp
Great vid just sick of hearing Ize always say "I have the best gear and fight the best Im king" I want the other players to just slaughter him next time he does that honestly
Ize just pisses me off bro
The ice kingdom was funny as hell 🤣🤣
i see xnestorio name
"Second Best Potato Farmer in Minecraft"  I'm dying XD  RIP technoblade-
Yeah cause techno was the number 1 potato farmer
I am suprised none of those players had the guts to end the dictator when he showed up alone
star killer is the type of guy in an election "VOTE FOR WHO YOU WANT FOR VOTE FOR preferably me still vote for whoever! Haha! vote for me."
all of jungle players probably haven't tocuhed grass since they like genshin 💀
For all it's worth, Ize IS a great military leader. But he lets his ego get in the way of true greatness.
Poor star killer man
you should make same video but modern time,like using guns,tanks,cars,motorcycles and other vehicles
The fact Jungle King are the worst....
19:22 oh my god, he's Zeke Eager!
I am really feeling sad for starkiller. Ize and 5aitama are tryna kill him and in the next video he gets assassainated
I miss Genshin :( I am broke and my laptop and mobile can't handle it :(
ize spicy things up tbh
I just realize u used the genshin impact song
Ize sounds a little like jackseptica
go green
Hey silver you should put the petitions for the next civilization video on discord just incase some people like myself arent able to get Twitter if you are unable to do that I completely understand and will continue to support you
the 1 of 3 reasons i liked the desert was just because of the guy who actually spent 30 minutes regaining a undead member,true hero
Zombie boi for the win
I don't care who won at least they beat ize again lol another great victory video dude 👏 😂 🤣
genshin impact sucks and the fanbase can smd
They placed the dimonds
Ize is so annoying
Ize is based
The problem with Ize is that he's a warrior and not a leader.
Your accent is something diffferent
ize is too power hungry
These have got to be my favorite types of videos. Kepp up the great work Silver!
for the down build my first was artic second jungle and third desert
Ize trying not to be a hypocritical murderer who sucks the fun out of every scene he's in:
Ize is awful
2:27 that’s the best 😂😂
Yep Desert was the under dogs but they came out on top. Strength in Numbers 🏆.
I wish this was how easy it was to make a country
Bruh, artic only got last because u didn't like they're among us statue
35:00  the consequence for betraying your nation
Guys please make this a gamemode on a server, it would be awesome.
People arguing if ize or starkiller was better. But honestly ize was just irritating to watch, whereas I enjoyed watching starkiller. It felt like i was watching an arrogant child try to rule a nation, ruling people by threatening to kill them ect ect. It felt like i was just watching a grown up squekear who would shout "rdm rdm!" In gmod.
Ice
Every Mario music for every biome is just amaing :D
Is it Java and bedrock
you guys saying “oh starkiller would’ve made a great king!” and “ize sucks” makes me kinda mad. although ize is generally not the nicest player on these mc servers, he sought out more for the jungle kingdom that starkiller could have never brought. sometimes bad morale is good morale.
This was really good
It’s kinda funny how Ize’s whole argument of “star doesn’t have have good armor” would be nulled if he was a better teammate and gave star the armor he got. “If you’re king, you get the armor.” EZ.  Edit: kinda happy Ize got taken down. He got way too cocky after taking down the Ice Team. Man’s needs to chill 😂
I was rooting for the jungle army until ize ruined it, star killer was a better leader
jungle didnt deserve the best supply drop
Man wish I could experience the magic of today's Minecraft...sadly I have yet to own a gadget that can handle its awesomeness...
"Easy enough"  *Moments later*  **Gets killed by a zombie**
All Ize does in any civilization is try set up an authoritarian dictatorship, launch a military assault and fail horribly
can we vote to permanently remove ize from the series?
Squidkid becoming the worlds best potato farmer after technoblade dies   Squidkid: I won but at what cost
i swear its always ize wanting to be king
Every video I've seen so far, I always manage to ge the right civilization, I even plan out what could happen, and am often correct about it
Ize is a Walmart brand virgin Connor mgregor that’s only good at Minecraft
Squid kid and star killer should be on the same team
"the natives arrived" "OH THESE ARENT PEOPLE THESE ARENT PEOPLE" Christopher colombusses great grandson?
Ize best person there
Since techno died doesn’t that make squid kid 1 #
I think the attic was cheated out of the supply drop, but that’s just my opinion, and Suep made some major miscalculations, but other than those, I think the atrtic would have won
This is legendary
I’ve watched a few of these so far and I already hate ize, dude sucks the fun out of everything
The desert
i feel bad for squid kid he went the best potato farmer wait mb SECOND best potato farmer damn squid got violated
Could we stop having to hear from Ize? Dudes always cringey and just annoying.
Anybody else hate Ize’s character?
Yo I realised Silver doesnt Like peace ... That Jungle King was kinda an asshole  to be fair he was skilled but he got early advantage coz he never learned to play team game  Attention seeking Whore is what he was  these are the kinda ppl who scare me during World Apocalypse  Dont support such mentality for content sake Silver .  They imply such stuff in real life as wel. others life mean Shit to these Selfish Bastards
2:24 now the best potato farmer....
Ize be like: No? Ok *Kills the guy who said no* Anyone else?
Can we appreciate how well ize actually did?
I did not immediately like the style of talk from the guy, but he did realize that jungle should have a huge equipment advantage over artic and chose to utilize that advantage to take all the good stuff they had from them. It is agressive, but it worked.  Perhaps it could have worked against desert also if they had a slighly more organized approach to it.
JUNGLE KING SUPREMACY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jungle
I know I saw XNestorio was I the only one
Ize haters are reddit armchair psychologists fr.
"and a huge battle with the natives commenced" BROOOOOO
I like the different abilities concept!
I’m just saying, but if Ize was already king what was the benefit in killing starkiller? Since then he’s just down an extra member he could use for war
No he’s the best potato farmer now… fly high techno
Even in Death abstrekt helped their nation, now that’s some dedication.
"led by the number 1 potato farmer, sorry read that wrong, 2nd best." You're God damn right.
I've been watching these videos and I've grown to hate ize lol
im gonna be rooting for Starkiller and seagulls for as long as they're around would 100% side with them over ize saitama, and suep (I'm convinced they're the main antagonists of this series of civilizations)
"Lead by the best potato farmer, wsit I read that wrong, 2nd best potato farmer in minecraft"
That jungle king, i hate him
I just love SQUID'S vibe 😂😂😂
Poor star killer. Literally gets assassinated in every video
Ize is a fucking legend. Took initiative, bolstered his tribe & nearly win it all by his own volition. He just needed a more tactical mind by his side
I don’t like Ize all he thinks of if pvp and saying people will be 2 hit and he reminds me of a mafia boss with his friends being his crooks
ig squid kid is now the best potato farmer alive now
God ize was a crybaby in this one too lmao
“Im gonna elect myself kin”, “Uh, No”
i like how the main thing i noticed in this video is the zelda music in the background
if ize is in your team just know that yall gon loose
Bro Ize has been kinda a crap leader no? fr always went on the attack and ended up losing, had Starkillers team voted for him it would have ended differently
I enjoy it a lot. Pro tip: play video at x1.25. You thank me later.
6:43 Conquistadors arrive in Central Mexico, colorized.
Bruh… why so many people know Genshin impact in your video…
Sure absolutely love you civilization movies you should totally make more 👏🏾👍🏾
Ize is the reason jungle lost. They had a better situation, better build, and better hear but because they went on the offensive too early they went down nearly half their ranks
Hey I used to watch ur Skyblock vid and I was sad when u stopped uploading a year ago but when I saw this channels content I was super impressed and I am happy for u that u found what u love to do👍
SQUID KID TECHNO
Please more of these videos, I enjoy watching these while also working. But can you add a few more teams or civilizations and make these more classic war, like the game risk, have pre set up bases and have teams conquer bases and fight till one victor
It's funny how everyone hates ize, I'm always rooting for him!
Ize is awful
I will always back Squid kid no matter what
So because there was an Aztec temple that means that the jungle region was mexico
i cant stand ize and his cpersonality
i want to be in your next video but how
Ize is the most annoying player I’ve ever seen
Ize is a Dictator
Ize is a true gamer
bro i see the other video of minecraft civilisation with the giant, the dwarf and the elf... AND THIS TIME TOO IZE JUST DO A REVOLUTION AND BEING AN ABSOLUTE TYRANT !!! HOW IS IT POSSIBLE ?? he always want war bruh
had hope on desert since the beginning when they worked together  which ever community is like that and doesn't betray always wins
I hate how ize and saitama always play they are just humans shit
i literally cried when the zombie helped them... so wholesome
2:20 I love that! 🤣👌
Ize is the worst player
Ize goes solo to gear up and then brags how he needs to be king because he has the best gear and he shared enchantment table after trying the best he could to hide it from everyone. As a king he threatens to kill anyone who dares to say otherwise. Man needs an ego check
Desert team here
I'm new to the channel so forgive for asking this. Is starkiller role playing? Like actual acting, like the typical Anime guy who believes in friendship and teamwork who will get betrayed in the end with who the antagonists who are 5aitama and....invict?
Nice hair squid kid
Good video
I cant even describe how happy I feel that Ize died 😂😂🎉🎉❤❤
Why is ize so hatable in every video, he is always a dictator, is he paid to be like this or naturally a bad leader ???😭
Wish I could join but I do not have the amount of free time this would require
I only root for teams ize isnt on
I feel bad for the one jungle guy that was always on the side of starkiller and wanted to defect to the desert but immediately got killed, he didn't deserve that
It is sad that he said the best potato farmer just makes sad because of techno blade
now he is the first best potato farmer
35:37 bro his voice, he was shaking lol
2:20 absolute violation
Should make this a real game mode 😂
The Amomg us one was so funny like how did they make it lol it was so sus lmao syssy baka
Even tough Ize is playing this charachter, he is so god damn annoying i hate it. hes like an conceited brat.
fun concept, I like it
imo ize is hilarious i like his strategy
killing the mogus statue was a piece of art
Ize is the fuckin worst.
I hate Ize
izebe acting like andrew tate
Ize is living his games of thrones fantasy or something xd
So if you want to lose, have Ize and 5aitama in your team. Literally they spend so much time bringing down their own people they can't focus on anything.
Genshin sponsor? Bruuuuuuh
Well squid kid is the best now
Story of the video: 1: Rich person with big dreams and a big ego runs for election 2: Diplomat seeks the throne and gets most of the village to back him up 3: Big ego guy persuades the village to following himself and gets elected 4: Chaos begins when a color of the moon makes monsters rise more often 5: Kings followers kill the diplomat during the confusion 6: King begins war but that backfired and caused a civil war 7: King forces the kingdom to rush towards the ice capitol 8: Jungle wipes the village of people living only refugees, but a big story begins from this… 9: Heartbroken Kings second in command is filled with hatred and goes on a murder spree 10: Murderous guy makes a plan to betray basically everyone and come out on top 11: Jungle begins fighting the desert winning at first but then gets wrecked 12: King realizes he is screwed and runs towards murderous guy 13: Murdererous guy betrays desert and helps the guy that took everything away from him?? 14: Traitor guy and king both die as well as the rest of jungle and ice 15: But one jungle person hides in a house to trap everyone and kill them but gets caught 16: Screwed guy is tooken to be executed and tries blowing up everyone 17: Screwed guy fails and is killed 18: The desert celebrates by blowing up their pyramid 19: THE END.
Ize: "you'll get 2 hit"   but still doesn't share his loot, even after becoming a king. At least starkiller contributed as a leader and grouped everyone for the building competition
Him saying squid kid is the second best farmer broke me bro because it reminded me of what happened to techno
That Ize guy is mad annoying icl
genshin impact? more like GenShit InFact
ize is kinda a jerk and i notice it more and more throughout this series :/ clicked off as soon as he turned king.
16:39
Imagine this with pixelmon
2nd best potato farmer thecno never dies
Watching this today realizing that the line, “The best potato farmer…” is true again.
Squid kid is no longer the 2nd best potato farmer. Rest In Peace technoblade.
25:06  ah yes a creeper
Jungle
Well squid kid is the best Potato farmer now
9:03 a lot of fatherless children 18:17 more fatherless children
Abstrekt: I might be a zombie but that doesn't mean i can't join fight
First Place Potato Farmer... Lives forever in our hearts
R.I.P TechnoBlade
I’m slowly growing to hate izes selfish and asshole tendencies.
I really feel like there are a few people who are absolute jerks. They take a lot of the fun out of it and out of the video. Honestly, don't want to watch at times just because I hate their idiotic behavior. They behave as if only they are smart and seem to have the belief that if they don't get to have everything go only their way they should ruin it from others.
When ize die it was the most happy moment of my life, even if soup tried help him he only kamikaze himself to make desert win
The Ize vs Starkiller plot seems to happen every time.
ize is an mc i swear
Bro Ize has been in 2 videos so far that I've watched and he's ruined both for me..
How did that guy even become a zombie lmao
The 1st potato Farmer , Rest in Peace TechnoBlade 🥀
sad news technoblade just  passed away squidkid can take the position of the best potato miner
I miss technoblade
How did the artic not win the building vote what😭
Idk why so hate for jungle ize was mostly offensive rusher a Chad man you see how they killed the whole artic? There were many cowards in jungle because of which they died and star killer wasnt even a warrior class he was a peace guy which would soon turn out their team to get attacked like arctic by others ize was smart he rushed perfectly but because of many cowards retreating they died
its always saitama and ize
jugle and desert
Just stumbled on this video and don't really want to watch this kind of thing again if it has the Jungle Leader. Was an absolute prick.
ize haters rise up
My fav is dessert then Arctic the jungle kingdom is chaotic lol
2:22 squid kid is actually the best potato farmer because technoblade sadly died
Ize is mad annoying bru
ive watched this video like100 time great job silver
I hate ize
so already second video with Ize yelling like a little girl. Should I join your games and pet him?  Come to daddy
Ize and saitama are literaly sooo anoykng... Like, everytime starkiller gets elected they start some revolution shit and kill him for no reason
And you guys killed none of them? GoSh
2:20 Potato wars reference! YEA
2:22 when you realize that the best potato farmer in the world is now dead :(
well, now squid is the #1 potato farmer…  Rip techno
Ize is my least favourite human in almost every single one of these videos. He's such an asshole
Jungle lost because they got drunk off the ease of their first victory and got cocky
Wow! Love it when the good guys win! 🎉
Ize is the anti hero of this world
Pls don't invite ize back
I swear that Ize kid is so annoying, sucking fun out of everything and he made almost half the team die
I could imagine a scene of the remaining artic player begging the dessert king to let them in and then one of them is like “pls just talk to out leader” then out of the shadows missing a limb or an eye supes walks out of the darkness while all of the dessert king’s body guards bring out their cross bows
Ize is a little bidh
I sided with jungle
Abstrekt served his nation even in death
The Genshin impact music makes me want to hop on Genshin lol
jungle civilization was militarized and powerful, they could find resources anywhere but they were very focused on defeating other civilizations.  the genshin impact (desert) civilization was organized, not much was shown about it, they were focused and had good warriors.  the arctic civilization was the weakest. they looked like rabbits playing in the snow, not caring so much about defeating other civilizations.
"...talkin to them like u are Jim Jones" I fuckin spilled my drink all over me
Ize was a whole ass supervillain fr
Gayshit impact LLLLLLLLLLL
“We have to honor Le Monke.”
For all those praising Ize, he's just your average high school bully. Totally forgettable. Being stronger/better isn't a reason to go bossing around.
ize___ its so annoying
Seeing Ize's behavior makes me want to break his legs.
I  think squid kid should automatically be king and that Ive should  just be banned
are these staged?
jenshin impact
Ize king
I fucking hate ize, jungle wouldve won if starkiller was still there
SILVER WE NEED MORE OF THIS
Ize really likes to use meta gear to ensure he wins alot
You need to live more to make more of this 😌
Noooo bad jungle
the best part about this video was the part where the zombie attacked along side the desert despite being a zombie
The last words of the Jungle king : have you ever heard of genshin impact?
Not gonna lie, IZE has no actual leadership skills, and the way he manages to convert all of these people makes me so mad. They’re so weak minded 🫥
Bloody legendary.
deasert and artic arsert
Fuck yeah
Bruh ihate that guy in jungle like hes keep saying he got pvp experience like van you 1 vs 20 people at the same time even you got good loot
the desert team is rude
Made on my birthday
The mf that tried to betray jungle and just died 💀
Why my boi star keep getting betrayed and murk Bc of election?(tbf this is only 2nd vid)
Okay Ize is kinda annoying and rude
Ize is a VILLAIN bruh
I remember when you were at 60k subscribers and you were making good content and you’re at 2 mil and you’re still making good content unlike other creators who let the popularity get to them and start making trash content and always just trying to get paid instead of making sure their fan base is actually enjoying their videos
I really like the differences between Ize and Star, star was intelligent and had a winning strategy of being peaceful and playing slow and steady, while ize wanted to rush and thought they were invincible. The funny part is how ize at like 28:35 or so says that star would have let everyone else kill each other and then get slaughtered by them. The winning team, the desert, did that exact thing but won. Karma at its finest.
Not Izes
The only real answer on who to root for is StarKiller's Jungle Team. Ezes literally has zero friends
yesss goooooooooo
Ize and Saitama makes it hard for me to watch this goddamn. Annoying af.
2:20 TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIESSSSSSSSSS
28:50 actually Ize is right
11:25 sus
NAH jungle king is a big W stop hating in my mans starkiller probably would have lost even faster
this going to be so good!
lol ur teasing squid kid but ur true tho
Bro ize sucks
Desert was definitely the team I enjoyed and knew was gonna win.
can we all agree that nobody like's Ize? like honestly
In my opinion the arctic houses we’re the best but ok
Tbh I was rooting for jungle until the election ended, then arctic until Suep went crazy, then all I wanted was for desert to win.  If I were jungle I would have left directly after the election before anybody noticed and went to arctic or desert.
I’m so happy Jungle lost. Instead of charging into battle as soon as they got the chance, they should’ve focused on getting better gear and military for their team, but their tyrant king was impatient and cocky and got his whole team killed because of his false confidence
Ize and Saitama always destroy their civilization.
Ize is the type of person that has no power irl but acts big and bad in game
Was playing genshin while watching the video
Yooooooo
best part of ize tryna rule is he fails every time
bro Ize always tries to take over because hes greedy and can't stand not being king
The zombie storyline was amazing
Dude the last jungle guy is the guy star was praising for building the farm that’s so cute
34:50 actually good call bc 5ive was like a right hand man to Ize no way he was serious
I think Ize is so annoying
The zombie warrior was the greatest and funniest form of plot armor in the story
So happy both Soup and Ize lost, thought they were assholes
Everyone favorite, watching people killing each other in Minecraft!
Imagine if in the next one, not the fantasy kingdom but in another one someone outright assassinates Ize the second the game starts because they know he’s a d*ck
i see why people might like ize as a character but he just seems like an all around insufferable guy, what a douche
Can this be played in bedrock
Squid kid I wouldn't not have that of silver
35:50 that fucking killed me
is no one gonna talk about 2:21
whoever that arrogant dude is, hes ruining the videos for me
I wish that the desert people win cause the jungle king is too eh-...rude
U should do more videos like this I love them so much btw I'm a new subscriber
The militarist faction of the jungle are such vilains like : stealing the group loot, playing solo until they have the strenght to force their ideas on to others, refusing to just do an election. I don't know if it's on purpose or if they are just that selfish unironically but very entertaining anyway x)
I'm noticing a theme here, where if a civilization has ize it goes terrible, and if it has squid kid, he organises everything perfectly
Jungle king was a right prick
I wish star was king
24:34 was that really his plan cause im confused and does ize have something against starkiller cause that’s second he did that but the first time was to join there civilization
Jungle army having an Irish dude as the leader was amazing
didn't have to do squidkid dirty man he was the best potato farmer at one point
god Ize is so self egotistical, he ruins every scene he's in. the video drops so much in quality whenever he appears
That Jungle king dude sounds like Shrek but as a Reddit Mod.
it's such a shame how the jungle team could have actually won if ize selfishness didn't came out. Starkiller would have taken everything in a strategic ways rather than just ambushing and confronting things while leaving and blaming all the dead jungle player for their own leader's ideas like ize did.  And I feel really annoyed how ize has this kind of temperamental personality, and was really  exposed when some disagree of him being the leader, by threatening that he'll kill them. i mean, is that even a good leader would do, honestly?   and  even if ize has better gear than starkiller, if the cooperation and team work between the king and other players didn't come aligned then a gear would have no use then.   "headless chicken.." hello, you're the one who actually did a premeditated murder to them? who's the one with a stone head wanting to ambush another team while there's literally lots of zombies, skeletons, etc. came out?   I just wish that there were scenarios where the jungle team betrayed ize, but I guess the majority of them have a similar personality like him  but I mean if he does this for content, then he absolutely succeeded in portraying that "whiny little brat" guys
Best potato farmer techno post sorry 2 best potato farmer
The fact that he knew about the potato war got me to like the vid subscribe and turn notifications on
“He has worse gear, he’ll get two shot” then drop your shit n give it you the king the people want? Greedy man
Jungle
I like the fact the he using genshin themes
The one thing that Starkiller had that Ize didn't was intelligence, true leadership, and patience... If Izze would just let Star lead for once maybe things would be different as Ize's pride, greed for power and narcissism got the best of him for one narcissism can be a dangerous thing for a person especially when they think they are always right...This is why I dislike Ize... Starkiller would've been my go-to leader and no matter the threat of death I would rather run to another kingdom than listen to Ize... by far the Desert Kingdom was my favorite due to their impressive defense even when caught off guard. My number one life quote is "If you wanna be a leader then lead with honesty, integrity, kindness, organization, and confidence for he who leads by fear, hatred, greed, and bloodlust will never succeed in their endeavors they will always fail one way or another and bring everyone else down with them"
I really hate izze
I honestly don’t like Ize at all. Mainly because of how he takes it too seriously and he blames everything on everyone else and is just an over all really disrespectful
Lol Ize is such a self centred, boastful jerk
Man saitama is always doing this shenanigans.
Where the two are fighting, the third one uses
Ize just gives off toxic player vibes from both videos.
I was loving the Arctic kingdom but after Soups betrayal I was rooting for Desert they deserved the win
The artic civilization is SUS!
Did anyone noticed genshin music was playing in the background in whole video?
Me who already plays genshin and have all of those characters:       interesting tell me more
Wow.... a really great video... i didn't even know minecraft can be set like this XD But did you really have to use that liyue Bg.... i really though there was a  F*king dendro slime nearby....
necromancy work man lol
It's here: https://youtu.be/so9IL8ORZjY
Dude ize always joins starkillers team then kill's him to become king then leads the entire team to there death. this happens 99% of the time and the team always let's it happen
Ize is the Fucking best man, please keep him in all similar vids
Ize is the definition of anger issues
Ize is not a very good politician.
Love how those who think they can take charge by force are good leaders, they aren't. It just proves you're a weak leader cause you HAD to use force, proving your weakness. i would abandon them hella fast cause I know they'll bring us to ruin.  The fact ize lost his cool multiple times just proved he's a weak leader and is nothing more than a low level grunt used on the front lines. He's not worth fearing or following.
Lmao the arctic nation were like the innocent water tribe and the jungle nation was the fire nation
What is the music for the final battle if anyone knows
Bro I thought that the artic would win the build, there town looks so cute
That one kid that was against ize died because he didn't want to hear the truth thats what everyone fears
5:00 man sacrificed himself for two men
The jungle kingdom needs to touch grass
The Arctic had the most asthetic town ngl
Glad the Desert Kingdom won
10:25 EarthBound Music. Good Choice
Am I the only one who hates iZe just hearing this man name pisses me off
what would one person do for human civilization if they were the only one in survival mode
I was rooting for the desert. They deserved that dub.
this was amazing
Bruh the jungle tribe has no brains man! Its like if Superman came into a village saying I can lead you gives them everything they need and they say naw lets choose Dave the town dentist to lead us -_-
i hate ize.
WHY DOES EVERYTIME I WANT A TEAM TO WIN THEY NEED TO HAVE AN IMPOSTER!!!! 🌝
That zombie plot twist made shout let's gooooo!!! Haha love this
feel like snow were robbed in the village vote
Please stop putting Ize in these. If no other reason, he does the same shit everytime, we're here to see groups prosper not the same man child have the same entitlement tantrum every time.
Bro showed barely any of the desert kingdom :(
Another video like this pls
I feel like if starkiller became king they would had a chance to win
bro in the 2nd to 3 rd min of the video you did swuid kid dirty you said the best potato farmer and corrected yourself to the 2nd best potato farmer damn some emotional damage
so glad ize lost he was hella annoying
IZE arguably the worst guy to ever exist
can i ask what the song name in the intro?
xnestorio, my 5th favorite mc yter is in or am i seeing things.
Ngl Ize acts like a five year old and snaps at everything and then proceeds to take an L, I’m seeing a pattern here
Bro IZE is the best part about this whole thing
I feel like this is rigged same thing happens in all his videos
I stg this has gotta be scripted I knew it was mostly the same ppl but the fact that Saitama and ize couped against Starkville again
they had to make a spawner xp farm for loot at the Perimand
It’s always Ize and saitama and then star killer
Ize was such a buffoon in this.
Hate that Ize dude.
man that ice guy or whoever got stackeed was annoying
jungle is loser
Jungle shouldve gone with leadership instead of "me diamond gear, me stronk"
hey u r probally not gonna see this thx for making these 100 Players Simulate Civilisation in Minecraft videos they are so fun to watch and just wanted to say ur doing are great job and keep it uo
Go figure, civilizations built on war and violence don’t triumph over the ones that work together
Ize is always on some bullshit frfr
Jungle  no
me if i got hunger: just an exuse to eat rotten flesh
ize i can never trust ize watching these vids when het gets stacked, he used to get accuses about xray and he always gets so stacked in your stuff, fishy mining.
I genuiently hate Ize
Him says Minecraft servers were at peace. me stabbing every one i see HMMMMMMMMMMMM
Bro it’s literally Minecraft and I’m over here fuming watching Ize take power
You should do this except in skulk
The jungle was overconfident.
The largest group of Genshin impact enjoyers I’ve seen in one spot since never
ize is such an annoying person to see in these civilization videos. he’s always so rude and arrogant, he just wants what’s best for him
6:35 realises that the background music is from genshin impact song when you are fighting and not exploring into a new place.
Ngl Ize and Saitama are the most annoying ppl in this series They constantly argue and murder for the crown instead of trying to help the group out
Bro this Ize guy is so fucking annoying.
ize & saitama is so greedy & manipulative...
I like how he uses  a genshin song as background btw go play it it’s good yr welcome mihoyo
Ize mvp right there. All they needed to do was grow some sugar canes and craft an abundance of fireworks for the elytra and crossbows.
Im team artic
Why is your voice calming to me is that anyone else
Literally every video ize is being a menace to society
Honestly, fuck jungle. Why be a warmonger when you could be at peace and prosper?
Still my favourite video after watching like 3-4 times
Starkiller should stop trying to be king 😂
I was routing for jungle at the beginning when starkiller was leader he might have been able to unify all the players idk
Texture pack??????
Can you make a part two
Ize sucks.
Why does Ize always have to be the tyrant every video lmao
I hate ize so much
YEEE GENSHIN IMPACT MY FAVOURITE GAMEEE IMA XIAO MAINNN
Itze and saitama is the worse king and command he stupid and arrogant they fight without strategy and just think about his self and not his nation
Ize says "your gonna get 2-hit by the enemy team" but what he really meant is "your gonna get two hit by me"
Silver:Best potato farmer- wait I mean 2nd best potato farmer Squid kid: EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
How was the arctic base in last place for the town
Notice that ize always violently takes over his faction and always leads them to attack another faction and they they never win.  Interesting, isn't it?
Yikes...They should've stuck with Star..poor guy..
Play sky lock again
So are we gonna ignore the fact that 2/3 of the socializations have a huge disadvantage with jungle having good stuff and food while dester and Arctic have no food at all???
You should do elemental civilizations next
I want to Join
Someone already made this vid…
every damn video... this Ize guy does the exact same thing. eventually you would think folks would try and kill him day one, Saitama as well
17:15
Ize is such a bitch, he’s a dictator, he threatened to kill anyone who didn’t join him, he’s the worst fucking leader ever💀
StarKiller is a leader in all of these, so eh natural leader
This is the third time I've seen Ize tell someone "you're gonna get 2 hit". Dude sucks the fun out of every clip he's in.
They should put star on a separate team from ize(greedy dictator). Loved the vibes of the arctic
My favorite civilization was Abstrekt’s civilization
Ize and Saitama is always the one up to trouble like those corrupt politicians only to take power and wealth from a Country
ize is the literal definition of totalitarian
It’s somewhat tragic how ize and starkiller were both the two halves needed to win the war. Starkiller had the support of the people and likely would have used some strategy since they would be more organized. Ize had the power though and was good for the actual fighting with his people. If ize didn’t let his ego blind him and worked with starkiller they likely would have been uncontested the strongest team but instead failed because ize tried using the exact same strategy twice and the ambush was ruined by someone who abandoned his team because he didn’t have the trust of the people
I liked the jungle kingdom the most.
noones commenting this, but Arctic shouldve won the villiage square
Bro I swear I hate ize and Saitama they always ruin things it annoying wanting to be the strongest

i hated the jungle king hew was to greedy a sounds like a dumb ass thats why he died
Kingdom in a nutshell
Ngl in my opinion if mfs from jungle didn't die to mobs jungle would win. Ize is a real leader
I’m so glad Ize lost. What a prick
JUNGLE!!
The Irish guy is such a nerd
Jumped ahead of the video to see that Ize had died. Went back satisfied and rewatched the rest.
Lol WHO MAKING AMONG
Ize is such a bad leader and it’s funny watching
I can't imagine the work that you have done its amazing like your vids❤️❤️😍
Ooooooh I get why you use Genshin music now I'm a Genshin player and was wondering why you used the fight music in your videos. Also I love the idea of having natives in the jungle kinda like the Amazon, that's something I've always wanted in Minecraft.
Ize is just a arrogant prick. Sure going diamond makes him a strong warrior but he is no leader as a leader would have tried to organise his team to improve everyone rather then just himself.
Ize was so much fun to watch him slowly kill his whole population lol.
9:03 everyone's a simp
Was on jungles side until they became such a bad nation not just with morals but strategies too, their plan was to just kill and then kill again but ended up just getting smacked around in the end.
Hey, what is the name of the song on 6:40?
Jungle had the most interesting story but Desert was definitely the smartest with taking refuges and just overall thinking more steps agead
Ize is a based chad
The actual content is interesting but the narration makes it even better, I like his style
can you do this on bedrock too pls silver
Wait squid kid was in this
May i ask where can i get the 3 biome map/seed?
ize ruind the video ...
ik im late but why did diluc have whiteblind of all weapons
Desert I rooted for to the end
2:24 nahhh bruh thats a violation
“I read that wrong” “the 2nd best potato farmer” 😂😂😂😂
Yeah second best potato famer
God, I’ve watched two videos with that idiot Ize in them, and I’m so sick of him. He legit has nothing better to do than to cause drama. I just want him to be taken down a fookin peg
These videos are so staged and the lowest civilization always wins so predictable unsubscribing1🤣🤣🤣🤣
Idk why ize and the other dictator kings don’t use their wealth to buy the ppl. Like they have the gear for it.
Bro u toxic “2nd best potato farmer” 😂😂😂
Best potato farmer wait no man you did not
POTATO WARS!!!!!!!
40:05 THE BEST ZOMBIE IN THE HISTORY OF MINECRAFT
38:14 GET THIS BOY BACK ALIVE
Saitama and Ize are in both civilization vids, and were the players who caused the ruckus.
Ize and 5aitama must be unloved they’re so freaking annoying like what the heck
"Oh Genshin Impact Hell yea Baby"- some legendary words
Ize is just a bully, how did he expect anything to go well with leadership like that
If they rushed desert first I think they could’ve won
This is like a full blown movie! We have the tribe that's really kind and kind of wishy washy (the artic) - they were happy and peaceful but not that strong, resulting in backstabbing and them being taken over The really angry tribe that doesn't think, just attacks with their villain leader with the perfect backstory.  Then we have the strategic desert tribe that uses their head and their fists.
Any team that Ize, Starkiller and Saitama are on they immediately cause chaos,  Whilst this makes great content, they're obviously toxic players.
i love the vid
please make more of this. Its very entertaining
I came from watching your latest civilization video. Why is starkiller always getting assassinated? Haha They should be separated as much as possible for a different outcome. 🤣
this Ize guy is far to angry for leadership
Jungle the best
The soup turning arc made me go “what”
I already play Genshin.   :^)
It seems that it's always Ize that's looking to overthrow anyone on any custom map lmfao he's my favorite anime character. Great development arc gotta say
Bruh I want to see ize die so early in one of these videos
Y do they listen to ize they could have just killed him. Gear is no match against numbers
9:07 “Oh Gensin Impact? Hell yeah baby!”  -Some guy in minecraft
“Before we see how people react to world hunger, let’s look at our sponsor, Genshin impact!”
It's clear Ize knows what he's doing, but he has no idea how to work as a team.
You know how to combo-🤓
OH THATS WHO SQUID KID IS! POTATO FARMER!
It’s “Began” not “begun”  Edit: begun is NEVER used alone, it’s always “has” or “have begun”. So whenever you say “something begun” you should be using “began”
“Led by the best potato farmer…” “WAIT I READ THAT WRONG”
The artic is getting bullied 🤣
MVP: Husk
35:53 gosh 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
dersert was funny because they had a fallen risen zombie warrior
IamaSquidkid is literally a Farming legend to be able to stand against techno. Ibet he still remember's it lol
I don't like Ise, he is always a tyrant😡
Jungle is the best civilization
35:50 Love this line "and you guys killed none of them?...... Gosh"
7bmu7
Bruh 60 primo gems can’t get your shit and I said purple Adventures adventures experience it sucks
technoblade would focus in being an anarchist :)
wait, there is xnestorio in the intro :(
Ize was good for content but definitely cringe leader. If I were in the server I would’ve just yolo said Ize is a tyrant and tried to kill him. Maybe I would’ve died but I think others would’ve joined in for sure. But that would’ve lead to a civil war. Still would’ve been cool
I feel like if iez or Satama is in that kingdom chaos happens
Bro Ize got them killed thats what he gets
bro I feel bad for star like my man just got murdered for being fair ize and all his supporters that wanted to kill star for no reason
I like arctic
eeeeeh, I heard earthbound music :D
why does chungledoor of the winter kingdom sound like Chris Hemsworth?
Who’s the better leader Solev or Ize
The jungle fucking sucked lmao tf
hey, what mods did you use to add those classes? did you or your (supposed) devs make it? and IF SO.. can you tell us how to recreate it?
So... Iz dont do shit for people, kill all  opposition and betray all the people
damn ize is annoying
I want to sometime join a civilization event, but I don’t know if it’s on Java or Bedrock.
The things this guy does is insane, this is my second time watching him and im already addicted, the amount of effort must be immense, love the vids keep it up my guy
What’s the music called he started playing at 22:58
I am mad at ize because just because he was stacked he was so cocky and starkiller was nice motivating the jungle but just because he was out geared they betrayed him.
Bro that Ize guy is so annoying
Desert
do more civilization vidios
You just can't make this up.
5:45 you see? this is the kind of people I like
No offense to Ize, but he acts like an arrogant kid who streams for 1 viewer and lies that he is actually good
@Silver Can you tell Saitama and Ize to stop assasinating me?
The Greed of the Jungle king  makes the content even better
Your amazing
what's the music at 10:25? I swear I've heard it before but can't remember from where
I’ve never hated someone as much as I hate ize
Yo actually, props to you saving that chest from exploding buy placing a water bucket, that was clutch as hell
Jungle leader deserved the win, dissenters got the best of him
Hello
moral of the story: don't make fun of short ppl
Genshin impact music
The Desert Kingdom they were fun in the jungle kingdom had the worst leader because that guy was just a deceitful guy who I knew he didn’t have much strategy based off his reason to lead being I’m better at fighting because what if they just set up a giant TNT bomb and take out most do you guys you can’t take on 20 enemies by yourself
"2nd best potato farmer" hahahah the BM!
I almost un subbed
how the heck did the snow nation loose the supply drop thing
idk if I like the desert or artic more
"Here we have a statue to the sus people of the city" later "here is the susmas tree" and a genshin impact decoration. No wonder they got last place lol
The more times i watch this video, more i laugh at Ize's attitude. The guy is literally minecraft's Joffrey Baratheon
youn't shouldn't subscriben't nown't
2:20 Damn, poor SquidKid. Even when Techno is nowhere near, be still gets defeated by him
Although I dispise Ize I respect him for having the courage to accept his role as the “villain”
I feel like the guy who kept trashing on the jungle leader was being unreasonable and had his death coming. Learn when to stick to your guns, and when to drop em.
I think they got to much resources and support in this round.
I swear that’s Liyue battle ost in the background lol
star killer :)
We need more of this
I was for the jungle and the desert
My favorite is artic
Technoblade never dies
i swear Ize is the worst and most annoying person because he thinks everyone will just back him up the entire time but that will never happen and you need to actually listen to the people
Question: Does Ize always take over somebody in all scenarios? Answers: Yes or Yes
Ummmmmm na circles
dude, that jungle village is the most realist shit i have ever see in a game.
I wanna see way more of these there so ENTERTAINING
I love squid kid he's the best
I absolutely cannot stand the way Ize speaks to the other players. He single handedly kills whatever civ he's put in. #Starkilleristherealking
i loved desert one
Wow "clap clap clap"
this is 2nd vid and tbh dont really like the Ize dude and his gang. idk if Ize is playing a character to make the vid more interesting but .... if i were in the same team as him i would just assume the game is lost or try to join another side
Next civilization just hope that ize doesn’t try to assassinate star killer for the thrown again and again
I feel like u basically just held them up gun point and said get on Minecraft and simulate civilization lol
When silver said a that's a lot of emeralds I remembered luke the notables 2000 day minecraft hardcore  He made a towere to max height and it was made of emeralds
Your vid is still the best
"and you guys killed none of them? Gosh"
jungle was my fav
Its all scripted
Absolute massacre at the first invasion
i like how ize's only personality traits are thinking hes better than everyone and killing people edit: no hate, he's definitely playing a character, but that character is very unlikable
Copyer
you use genshin impact music
Abtract zombie: even in death i still serve
Aw that poor Jungle guy. And man I hope he didn't get bullied by the leader outside of the game. I'm on his side.
Gotta love how the logic for picking a leader was based on who had better gear. Even though, when you pick someone to be your king you could give them better equipment to protect them. Does no one know how to share in Minecraft?
bruh the Artic Kingdom would've won if they slided to the left
to be honest starkiller was a great king, even though he didnt focus on military, he focused on peace, so they maybe could have won
I love your vids
Dude I was cheering for the elves for so long
bro they always gotta kill starkiller wtf
Ize is so cringe, like good lord, no need to be so “I am in charge, I know what I am doing” he is so arrogant
Yo
Wheres the comments?
why cant i see comments
bro
what is wrong with Ize?
Ize really has a talent at bringing out the worst in people, he should be a politician. 0.0
Actually, the true winner and main character was Ize
artic
If I ever join one of these, I do not want to play with Ize. I know he’s great for a common villain for everyone to hate, but his horrid disposition would just make me want to quit as soon as he rejoins the group after being selfish and opens his mouth. I can’t stand people like him and it’s pretty clearly not an act
Of course jungle Lost, they had no organization and a weak af leader😂
How to play this civilization in your server?
36:45 i love the attention to detail that later on, artic joins the jungle leading to 16 players instead of 12
Ok I’ve seen a few of these videos and why is ize always an evil tyrant
"Stop waffling you 2-hit"
best movie i ever watched🥲
Desert sucks lmao. Just stood around until it was easy
My new favorite thing to watch I love the jungle team made the video so interesting
Loved the video @Silver! Can't wait for the next video man! I don't really have a Favorite Faction, but I liked the Parts where the Arctic Faction looked as if they were ready to Join Technoblade and become an Anarchist Atheist Faction after losing three of their own to the Ravager that you airdropped as well as the Jungle General dying to Fall Damage after Ender Pearling out of the Ambush LMAO!
Ize really needs better leadership skills
I womder why they didnt resurrect the other desert loses
glad the genshin team won
I’m recommending you here to have more chance with you,I cashed out $5300 as you promised,thanks bro more deal 🙏
I’m recommending you here to have more chance with you,I cashed out $5300 as you promised,thanks bro more deal 🙏
Star killer actually leads them in building and they get the win on the supply drop. Ize cries about his gear and somehow gets voted. Then his plan was literally “kamikaze”. May have worked out for them but still lmao
The artic was my favorite. May they rest in peace
Ize is such a menace
i wanted jungle to win
Dude u thot gor sher that jungle would win but I guess not dang
WOAH HE GOT SPONSERED BY GENSHIN
The plutocratic approach proved itself better in this game mode than the elected "leadership" of a motivational speaker.  The Starkiller guy has done nothing but lull his people, telling them how well they may have built their civilization without a plan to win the actual game. "Jim Jones" is not such wrong of a name drop.  Meanwhile, the Ize guy has taken control of his willing demi-group, later also obliging the pacifists/element-of-surprise-disrespectors on his own to join, and nearly almost wiping out and expelling the Arctics. Doing that during blood moon was risky, but the surprise was big enough and success proved him right until the desert campaign.
9:06 and that is when 14 peoples’ dads disappeared
The jungle king is actually terrible
Yay
did nobody realise xnestoria joined at the start??
9:05 = no parents
Nah homie just roasted squid kid so bad 💀
If u hate ize, reply to this comment
Star killer?? (Force unleashed btw)
Yay snad kingdom
i am addicted to these kinds of videos help
Yo, 2:23, man really disrespected squid after he got annihilated by Technoblade LMAOOO
I cant say that the jungle king was a good villain, cuz jungle lost because of his poor inteligence and crowd control skills, but its good that there was a villain, made things more thrilling
he had to add second best farmer lol techno blade won the war lollol
ize is just toxic
Holy shit jungle empire is based
Ize don't care about them all he care about is power and  he's a cold heart person
I like when someone in jungle team put on a one punch man character
I like the jungle and how badass Ize was. While Seup was completely the opposite. No balls
Ize was very chaotic and aggressive,even to his own people. I wanted Jungle to win before Ize showed up, Starkiller was a good man! Then i started routing Dessert
The best thing Is the Supermario music in the desert
Starkiller (Love you!) Ize (Fuck you!!!)
Ize pisses me off
No way xnestorio is their I'm pretty sure that he's civilization win
Dwarf fortress will be in the next video
CAN I PLAY WITH YOU
I AM LOW SNIPER
I LOVE YOUR WORK
Him:bloodmoon Me:infinyte tsukoiomi
I wish there was a public server where there were 3 civilizations. Once a month they fight and hardcore is enabled for the whole thing but people get revived after the once a month fight.
Arctic definitely had the best town
All the games he could sponsor why Genshin impact
Techno is best potato farmer
I liked ize and jungle
Yeah the 2nd civilizationvid dwarfs revenge the jungle
9:53
Little Irish kid is nagging too much.
Respect For the zombie
he’s sponsoring the most simp game ever…
Silver " squid kid is the number 1 potato farmer in minecraft "  Techno " what did he say "  Silver " nope squid kid is the second best potato farmer "
I just found ur channel now I’m bingeing every civilization video
i liked the jugle the last player was lost and that is how he servived
can i be in it?
I like how the jungle nation became a case study for how tyranical dictators get power and lead their country to ruin
ize is so annoying
Noooo, the Arctic Bois :(
2 best potato farmer 🤣
ize is such a minecraft rambo, i hate him
I like jungle but they losee😂😂
i stupeid
VV
NOT GOOD im sorry i still like your content
SIVER YOU ARE SAVEG
I just guessed the desert and the fun i had was insane u are the best
Artic be vib'n.
My favourite was Ize and I liked so much the Jungle
Bruh i swear in the future if ize is on someone's team they all going to assassinate him LOL
liked arctic the most
Ize is the kind of guy I’d have assassinated the second I spoke to him.
Can u host 1 tournament for bedrock players ??
Im seeing a pattern here with ize
i love jungle and i wish im in minecraft so i can see the youtuber hes name is silverrrrrrrrr and suep
Ailver i whant to join  please
i think probably everyone hates IZE
Fuck jungle, for Arctic
How can I get in one of these videos if I can?
The jungle king is a bit of a dick... 🤣
I can hear i the background  the mario music
Jungle town:fighting for the thrown Snow town:Christmas cult chanting
bro you part of the uberboyo program? Ayyooo hello fellow boyo
30:46 noo the poor amogus
not the mario music 💀
Ize honestly pisses me off. Yes, he might be a good solo fighter, but seems to not only prioritize his own ego over the team's greater good, but seems to have no concept of general strategy or interest in expanding the logistics that support his army. Unsurprisingly, it results in failure, just like in real life. You might be good, and even if you use war to distract people from their current situation, you aren't winning alone. The best fighter means nothing if he's charging into armies on his own.
What the heck the zombie can fight???????
Totalitarian Dictatorship Jungle🌲,  Democratic Arctic 🥶, And socialist desert 🏜️
I love you star :c i really do..
i don’t know why the jungle king is so annoying
Ize lost again, history repeats itself. Down with the toxic prick, up with the wholesome team that worked together and killed him!
Minecraft civilisation but you can level up select race and speciality (warrior, etc)
Bro when are people gonna realise that ize is not a good king if any of you are in his video don’t give ize the crown bro is a tyrant
That was epic!!!!!!
THERE'S A YOUTUBER CALLED SILVER IS ME AND HE'S TRYING TO BEAT YOU IN SUB'S
I love it. Really great
desert winning this was such a shit ending
That rat that portrayed jungle got what he deserves
SQUID KID GOT RASTED BRUH HAHAHAH
This video was like watching documentary in history class or something.
Silver: The best potato farmer Silver: *Realizes mistake* Technoblade: So you have chosen… Death.
LMAO i love how silver insulted squid kid by saying the best potat- i mean second best potato farmer
I kinda understand minecrafts playerbase is a bunch of 12yo… but they make for shit enterteinament
Huge stabilization call by the desert, tactics really turned the tide in that war.
I think you should make a video where there is a bullying ize competition
Ize is so fucking cringe..
Jungle King was a straight up doosh canoe, one of those keyboard warriors that acts tough asf online but would get a beating IRL
The desert kingdom is my favorite
add a sequel this one's lame
9:03 The most scripted thing ever
Technoblade will always be number 1 potato farmer
im not even gonna lie man def some favoritism towards the jungle kingdom, it was kinda ass arctic was the best
I was rooting for desert kingdom, they were very organized, the jungle kingdom was really cocky and sloppy with their leadership and battle tactics
I’m so glad dessert won  Cuz that green guy was a dick (ya ya content yada yada yada but still)
This video was fantastic, people are hating on certain people in the vid but you honestly should look at them like Game of Thrones characters. Ize was a prick and he was stupid to think having gear was all he needed but thats what made him so entertaining. Suep trying to join Ize at the end was one of those shocking twists at the end of a series that you would never have expected. To join the man who slaughtered your people and drove you to distrust everyone was truly a twist. Suep always wanted HIS nation to win and that meant even if he had to join IZE to keep arctic alive he would. Alas it didn't play out that way and poetic justice was served. Star being betrayed was a good showing of how you can't just be a nice democratic leader, in order to KEEP democracy you have to fight for it and denounce fascism (which Ize clearly was a fascist during this) whenever it rears it's ugly head. The zombie desert member fighting in the final fight was amazing too. This was one of the most entertaining MC videos I've ever seen and I really hope we can get another one soon!
9:03 humanity has fallen
what sever host did you use for your civilization
While Ize was the villain of the story, that zombie guy was the hero.
Minecraft used to be cool... and now look what it has become. A swamp of bruhs, TTV's, dead memes, and the dream smp. Smh Nah, it's still awesome. Just a bit cringey lately (except this guy, he doesn't "bruh" every second.)
FARTHERLESS
Dude Ize literally annoying dude.
I love that there's a villain in this challenge, alot more entertaining
32:07 “If Starkiller was still here we’d be still at our village eating carrots”. bro that shit had me dying 😭
Plz do more of these
The jungle leader feels like a dictatorship thing.
Loo
in the end, the 30 minutes it took to bring the zombie payed off
imagine if pvp was enabled the whole time and instead of starkiller, some bloodthirsty member of the jungle met ize when he was pretending to not have to enchanted armor
*Genshin music plays*
When is the next video
3:56 no more degeneracy
20:48 Ravager:Wassup. Now DIE HEHEHEHEHE
ize was the only competent player next to the one arctic warrior
I knew it that the desert would win it was a peaceful nation and good leader
Bro just post a viral vid and be gone just like that
«Jump if you like child pornography!» every single Genshin impact player: *jumps*
I knew choosing desert was a good idea when they brought back a teammate through necromancy
2:21  "led by the best potato farmer... wait, i read that wrong. SECOND BEST POTATO FARMER IN THE WORLD!" man! that was a heavy hit.
Zombie mvp
in the first time i like jungle because i like green. but when the king election i hate them the most. my favorite was the desert
why weren't you posting anymore
This mod is interesting
I wanted the artic to win
4:58 HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF get this man a medal, he saved like five people right there
please do this again and PLEASE allow me to be in it!
Honestly the thing that annoyed me most about ize is his voice
Bro you faked this. When you said that the ice nation was the first to obtain diamonds the person who got them placed the ore down then broke it
Say what you want about ize, he made this episode
wow this video went really dark.
I love how he said “second best” potato farmer.
Okay you might not like the way ize did things but honestly that’s the best attack strategy in this kind of event. A surprise attack with your whole force is going to get so many free kills. The enemy will always just run away if there not expecting it. Also in the beginning he was right about doing more for the people by getting the enchant table and not talking it up.
This was amazing. Arctic had wholesome home spirit. Ize was a badass. And the dessert felt like a real civilization.
Yo putting kaiserreich soundtrack in your videos just got you a forever sub.
that group of Jungle dudes who were still loyal to starkiller took an L when they submitted to Ize
I really didn't like Ize, even if this was just a game...
Jangel second leader is dum
I HAD to come to the comments when he started dissing squid kid. Kinda wish techno was on one of the other teams 🤣
Where are you :(
Where's the General?
I would have left Jungle immediately the second ize came around from his cave
So much for that king in diamond winning.  I thought he said he would win if he was king
I've been subscribed to you silver since you have 200k subscribers
This was actually a really good story lol the warmongering king Ize murdered the benevolent Star and recklessly waged war with the other kingdoms, perishing in battle It was entertaining from start to finish
Mommy yae is hot abut mommy Beidou is stronger idk who to choose
be honest we all loved the arctic
Bro you inspired me to hold one of the contests I did it with my friends/cuzins (12 people) the was the arctic wolves (the team for the arctic.) And the dust devils (the desert team) honestly it's so fun making and playing the world with friends!
The absolute shade on squid kid
2:23 You did Squid dirty 🤣🤣🤣
"Wait I read that wrong. Second best potato farmer." Brutal.
what ha[pend to hypixel skyblock?…
I rooted for jungle
is the arctic being lead by Gordon Ramsay?
Your content is good keep going 😁😁
ngl this is best civ vid i have ever seen
Silver could you please give us the link of the mod and map so i do this civilization thing with my friends?
ize: I have an army.  Desert Nation: We have a mummy.
I liked jungle until ize got elected, then I was rooting for any other team
hello my keyboard is new
Jungle king was doing some game of thrones shit, so I'm glad he lost.
Silver you said on the blood moon a creeper killed a desert member but it was a phantom
The jungle arc it’s so stunning and amazing! Showing the rise and fall of a prosperous empire that got wrecked by their diplomatic differences.
It was a good vid but that ending was trash
привет из россии
Blood moon reminds me of the blood moon from Zelda breath of the wild
ABSRACT!
The reckless leadership of ize reminded me of the way the nazis handled war. Creating fear, betraying and eliminating his own teammates. Expecting every one to be a perfect warrior and sacrificing many of his team on the way just to gain the 2-min advantage? Not to mention him abruptly leaving his group alone and also picking on anyone and threatening them who even spoke a word about the other candidate or himself, making the person instantly feel isolated and fearful. Also interesting how anybody from the jungle team who presumably wanted to change sides was instantly eliminated by the other teams without much hesitation, having their unpredictable and reckless image.
Star killer was a bitch
Man dude why didn't you do anything about it
Dude the use of Super Mario Bros Wii made me so nostalgic for the game lol, now ima go play it 😂👌
Every one who jumped when he said if you like gentian impact is fatherless
pls back to sb
Ize was a good villain because he was annoying af
“Wait, I read that wrong, the 2nd best potato farmer”  Squid kid:  *EMOTIONAL DAMAGE*
hey I have a suggestion for a new video... what if you swap the passive mobs with hostile mobs, for example going to a village and see zombies, but at night, villagers spawn. or instead of skeletons, you see centaurs or something
there is one thing that i want to know...  WHO KILLED THE COW?!
Ize pulled a hitler and repeated his message to the people until they believed him
I really wanted the jungle kingdom to win to be awnist
What background music is that on 1:09 it’s sounds soo familiar
That background music is sooo familiar, where is it from?? 1:10
I’m a squid kid is friends with technoblade
did silver die? its been 3 months
21:16 what a good content LOLLL
9:04 go touch grass lol
jungle should have won , the leader was amazing but he was outnumbered
way better than dream
Jungle team>>>
The new leader if the jungle was not smart- i liked star better bc the new leader was mean and he got his team killed-
Good job on 2mil subs congrats
ize was the highlight of the whole video. he was brutal and honestly he could have won if more of his soldiers had better gear
Ize is a fantastic antagonist... but a TERRIBLE person irl. Dude definitely has a heavy case of narcissism.
Ize was the best, he had a goal and wasn't willing to settle for less than victory. True hero.
Annoying irish kid, sheesh
Eyes sucks I hate him
This is by far one of the best civilizations videos I’ve seen yet
2:21 Had me rolling on the ground xd 😂
Jungle king was a legit villan, good video!
Pls start making videos again
Green
You know you're so fucked when the zombie found a way to escape from his boat and travel in the middle of the desert to be in the right place in the right time.
I hated Ize Bcz Of Him Jungle Lost If Star killer Is there Jungle Could've Won
Jungle should have won
silver, when u uploading its so boring without your vids
This so far is the most entertaining version of “civilization”. The other ones don’t seem as intriguing or epic
Lol the genshin impact music in the background
14:27 And this is when the civil war starts
2:25  *Splatoon sounds*
Dude Ize is just a bully, mad no ones likes him
was TimeDeo in the video? I only saw his ign in the beginning
Bro this is a stolen thumbnail
in the nether final boss and  overworld lava wizard in 100 and 200 days why are u using prestons voice'
I was rooting for Jungle, definitely made the game interesting.
Can't lie Ize made this video very interesting and entertaining no matter if you like him or not. So he's my favorite player from the video. Also starkiller was very cool, should've been protected at all cost

this ize guy is sooooo annoying. hate him. like, hes so stupid, because there`s no winners in a war. like, desert won because they were peaceful
I love the jungle leader lol
Why do you sound like you have a really runny nose?
use genshin impact music in the minecraft series check
Congratulations on 2 million you deserved it
Better mod pack pls play
this could make for a really good movie
i was with the desert from the start man and was so happy when they won and i thaught the jungle guys were such jerks man and also the guy who put his heart and soul to bringing abstrects zombie back to their village gotta respect him
MAKE MORE LIKE THIS
22:05 guys don't be persuaded he just has an accent 😁
Awwwwwr man I wanted jungle to win!!! The jungle king was so awesome!!!! Plis mooreeeee!!!!
Nothin makes me wanna play genshin impact like droppin 500+ on a single character that ya might or might not get despite dumpin entire paychecks into the game just for an improved chance of gettin a character ya cant buy outright   Mihoshi: Yeaaa even though you spent over a thousand dollars already your still gonna have to spend even more if you want that 5 star character   Me: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 boy ppl that pay sure are suckers lol, that's right ppl, keep droppin cash on GI in the "hopes" you get the characters ya want because you burn through your hard earned money that took you literally weeks to get just to dump it all into a game for 1 character you still might not get 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ize was a terrible king
Ice kingdom
sucks that ize messed up on the final and most important battle. he should've used a different strategy instead of immediately confronting the more numerous desert people. i think people would like him more if he succeeded.
I like the jungle
I was actually on suep's side until he decided to help the jungle king, Completely forgetting bout his main goal, To take revenge and rise the artic civilization to the top.   But other than that, I enjoyed the video. :)
Irish dude was goated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QubDENv6Fhc
I love that fact that the zombie guy helped the nation by killing the last guy😂😂😂
This is probably one of my favorite types of videos. Super interesting to see how some regular Minecraft bros act when given power 😂 the map edits and everything were also amazing and made it feel like I was watching a historical video😂 super good content and high quality I will be subbing and watching more 🔥🔥🔥❤️  Edit: (p.s. this deserves the 11m views most definitely)
5:51 《I can feel tha POWA!!!》
nah i think starkiller should have won’t the election he was way nicer than the other guy
I feel bad for Arctic
I don’t have tueter:(
The jungle dude is a case study in tyrany and why it doesn't work.
How do I join one of these
Desert and artic for me, I didn't like jungle why too chaotic and too much backstabbing
Ize was the best player in this,  he was the best leader, best fighter, and most ambitious, a tyrant, 10/10 antagonist.
You copied lover fealla
Bro I hated The new king for the jungle. I was rooting for them but I'm glad he lost, also this is the first video ive seen of you and its great!! tooooooo many adds though. ;)
Jungle forever!!
the death of starkiller was justified
3:32 and invest all your monye to get usless charakters and give the chiness people more money
It's been 3 months and you still didn't make a new video
when is the next vid coming out
15:10 was my fav part lol
The fall of ize was so good
Love the genshin battle theme you put on the vid
The article invasion can be made a real whole series ngl it was lit
Please make more of these
32:40 Bro the guys voice sounded so innocent and pure. Even if he did it for his fallen comrades i still hate him.change my mind
Once i thought that jungle was the best, But there's lots of traitor in jungle so i rather be with dessert side.
How did they make the zombie not attack them (deserters') but attack enemies?
warrrrrrrrr
Who else hates ize trash leader
I feel a better strategy would be that after the invasion they get everyone in full Diamond, the timing of the first invasion was good though, I wish the jungle nation won
“Uhm no” 💀
For the starvation event couldn’t they have just logged off and waited for it to end these players weren’t smart  😂
the fact that Silver called squid the second best potato farmer-i died
One of the best Minecraft Civilization simulation ive watched
This guy blew up then disappeared
Ize was like funny mustache man
Respect to that one guy who joined desert late game
Jungle
THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF I LOVE TO SEE 😃 👑
starkiller is cringe
I feel like it was pretty unfair for arctic and they loose in almost every civilization.
i love videos like this :D (im 9 but my mom let me comment undr faverite creator)
W DESERT
Arctic
Ize is so annoying
Winter/snow is a W civilzation
2:21 its just perfect
I think this might be stolen. It was uploaded after magicgum’s video and it has a very similar thumbnail, clould just be a coincidence, but still.
I’m only 8 mins in and this video is seriously well put together and I’m hooked already 😂
Just realized The music is from genshin impact
WHDGAGWTSDG I WASNT LISTENING UNTIL YOU SAID Taevat
Yes! I new the desert region would win
22:53 lmao Kong almost got assasinated 😂
Damn, I was hoping the Jungle would win this at the end. But also, I woulda given the Arctic village the best gear for that beautiful city, so maybe I just don't know anything.
Ize sucks!  Ize sucks! Ize sucks! Go starkiller , go starkiller.
Please upload on speedsilver
27:37 sounds like russia...
jungle fumbled they were superior in war but sold at losing 1 on 1s that couldve changed the tables
Jungle civilisation was definitely the best
Nice Clip from MagicGum ;)
**xNestorio has joined the game.**
The jungle king was really good militarily but suffered to see what his people wanted which is what led to his downfall all in all good strategies but he was way to cocky in his demeanor which led to his citizens not liking him
The jungle king was awesome. They obliterated the ice guys
I eyes Was a little bitch and an underhanded little bastard
Desert is best
mario 3d world and land music used btw
I was rooting for the jungle, after their attack on the artic
NGl we all went for jungle
All along I wanted dessert to win. I hated that Irish Jungle leader!
Jungle
The enchanting table guy seems like that one kid who annoys everyone in class by being just... them, not sure why though
Oh god i hate this jungle king just like a warrior brain logic
I liked jungle the most
Ive been here since 20k!
Uberboyo touched this channel
had starkiller become jungle king they would've won by remaining neutral till they had to fight
if star killer is alive jungle would have been won
howd they turn that zombie into a team8?
Does anybody the Youtube channel of the king from the jungle,
I was rooting for jungle, they were the ones that made this entertaining
Ize was a horrible leader from the start😂
25:06, he was kille dby a phantom not a creeper
I hate the Desert civilization
I like jungle i vote jungle
Who else is binge watching civilization videos lol
Epicccccc I want more
Green King kinda toxic af
I hate genshin inpact, but my cousin loves that game, so am sending her this vid
I liked Jungle the most in this
jungle was my fav
JUNGLE
I hated the jungle about to be king that died before he's so annoying with his carrot rubbish
I lost my 3 years old genshin account and got sad and deleted genshin impact. BUT NOW WHEREVER I GO I HEAR GeNsHiN ImPaCt.
The Jungle Kings actions led me to the conclusion that he's a absolute piece of shit in reallife.  The arctic people most definitely been the most fun to watch evolve.
Congratulations on 2m subs in 30 vids :D
When the creeper wandered in to the jungle a player actually threw him self into that creeper for another player
i am not going to subscribe since jungle did not win.
The game of thrones I always wanted
Jungle was number 1
Ize is a self-centered attention hog with no regard for human decency. Give him the crown!!
Mario
Congrats for 2M
Ize was just so selfish and rude to everyone
Why did u do squid like that 😂
C'mon sliver make a new video plsss u already have 2 millon subs and and like 11 millon views
Tbh starkiller / The unkinged was really nice he choose him over himself because of his kingdom. F to pay respect
U ok ? u havent uploaded in a while...
The best thing is that he said squid was the 1- no no no 2nd potato farmer TECHNO BLADE
2 Million!!! 🎇🎇🎇🎆🎆🎈🎈
Respeckt for abztrek
why does silver sound a lot like jacksucksatlife
this video was wonderfull. my favorite character was the zombie
I like this, this is the first video of silver that i ever saw and i like that the minecraft players actually did a great job at simulating and i like the general of artic dude
Jungle was my fav
The zombie chasing him! Lmfao!!!
Classic tale of 2 kingdoms destroyed by one greedy corrupt man.
f
At first I wondered why the didn’t just kill star killer on the beach. Didn’t realize pvp wasn’t on
9:08
Arctic deserved better
Jungle was the team I wanted to win, just because they were so close
Speed when are you going back to skyblock?
ize isnt a good irish guy. hes got the accent and i know it  hes not a good guy, starkiller was much better and they would have won  (im only 29:12 into the video so idk if they won or not)
It was WW2 but in Minecraft
rip arctic. rip starkiller. jungle L.
DESERT W!!!!!! PACKWATCH. SMOKING THAT JUNGLE PACK. LLLLL
all my homies hate Ize, big rip to starkiller.
Song name pls :D
Hypixel skyblock when??
Arctic
I like the Arctic the best any one who voted any other place is stupid
I like your videos and I hope you make more like this
I want more of these videos!!
Silver you should do coustom aether for 100 days
Technoblade is the better potato farmer
SILVER HAS 2 MIL GREATEST DAY EVER
40:50
How do you join a game
nooooooooooo jungle lost :(
Bro Ize_ was just a stupid anarchist, and warmonger. I feel bad for star.
The jungle people are stupid
I already play genshin impact
wow this is so much fun so cool too thanks for making this video silver 😀😀😆😊
The desert
15:06 that's what happens when you talk about Genshit Impact
whenare you up uploading again
The green team would of won if star killer was the leader
honestly the artic was the best civilization because they just had the best people
Artic had good builds
blue team should not have been allowed to join yellow honestly
I love your channels so much add me in my name is NitrousDust6680
Why genshin impact
genshin impact sucked
He never died by a creeper🤣
I loved this Video!! Will really like to see a sequel to this
Gungle
I love the guy who was like and you killed none of them ,god
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😳😵😎😎🤧☹️
The jungle king is so corrupted cus he had power
I was rooting for arctic
Damn I was rooting for the Jungle king
I was rooting for the jungle ngl
Silver is ded
Silver someone name “sliverisme” trying to get a better channel then you.
2M!!!!!
Why he talk so funny🤣🤣🤣
Desert
Is this Java?
15:16  Wow, the reaction time
So yeah if you do happen to get anything that benefits your civilization whether it's a villager or a cow or any other such thing keep it private keep it to yourself because players are scumbags. Grade f , low vibrational beastial losers.
Yo, this civilization vid was so epic. I never expected a Minecraft video to be this intense. We need to see the return of King Ize, he is an amazing antagonist and really made this feeling of intensity possible
"Simulate civilization" But everything is tightly controlled with events and POIs made prior
Can u do this with mrbeast?
Yegh, the non-team player expecting to be elected king. Guy was toxic as hell.
YOU HIT 2M subcribes
I liked artic more tbh
Wanted the jungle to win so bad
when nest video?
20:49 boi that's twisted
i always liked desert. Jungle was such an L. THE JUNGLE KING was so cokcy
Thats why I hate Politics😀
Generally dislike ize. Horrible leader who forced his people to fight in a invasion and was rude not letting people talk.
Yo he copied sip over
The great Jungle Conquest.
Awesome shit.. loved every second,   And i like the jungle king he was ruthless but powerful
jungle !!(:
honestly i love Ize he was a good leader . its just that the jungle fellows were too scared and didnt have brains. its true, if they stayed with star they would even get a step close to winning. if they listened to ize better they would have won
Im loving these videos man, keep it up
rip jungle
I just came across your channel and loved it! Your videos are incredible! Keep it up my friend!
BRUH YOU JUST COPIED SIPOVER
5:03 that sacrifice 😭
Jungle is more good
this video is AWESOME!! the quality of this video is amazing... i would LOVE a video similar to this in the future!! probably a half hour long movie idk? great work bro :)  and yes, i was kinda rooting for the jungle civilization too
Jungle villages don’t exist silver
you tought squid kid wined the potato war XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I was rooting for the jungle.
Desert
Mid impact
This is world war 2 on Minecraft
holy crap i didnt expect squid kid to be here
dude got sponsored by Genshin Impact... x_x
I love how this is always random and has a unique story in the end each time. Poor jack tho
The second best potato farm
Just subbed at 199k subs. Almost to that 200k!
Ginshin impact music going crazy
The jungle election is a bunch of grown men waffling and fighting who needs to be a leader of a Minecraft group
Ize is a leader i would betray to any of the other civilizations in a heartbeat, or just you know mute him. Imagine listening to someone talk like that the entire time you're playing a game. oof - big rip there
I hated jungle nation so much I wanted to meet the king of jungle and slap him, destroy his technology and ill be happy 💅
Cheering for Desert the whole way and glad they took home the 🏆
1.99 million subs if i sub does that mean 2.0 million?
Dude I wanted star to be the king not eyes, who knows how many eyes he has tho...dude was acting smart just when he got that crown, but yeah I think I liked the desert and arctic chivilization most
I like the technoblade and imasquidkid reference u made
Artic was best and I Wished they won
Artic
Im your 2Million-th sub!
Jungle had a revolution, accepted a dictator and followed him into the abyss.
fake, staged, barrier blocks
alternate title: fortnite but 100 players are split into 3 teams/3 biomes
the arctic kingdom was full of happiness. the desert kingdom was normal.  the jungle kingdom was ok, but I immediately disliked them once the war-hungry boss came in because war was not needed and everyone was it peace
ize is legit the representation of the nerd emoji
nice video keep up the good work :)
o7
genshin impact is shit so stop
I was rooting for the desert
Ize was a dick. He sacrificed his people for his twisted version of glory.
I'm serious u can make actual stories out of these civilization games
I liked jungle. Villains are the best. Ize might not have been the smartest one. But his charismatic attitude won me over.
Nobody likes Ize
In the beginning i liked the desert nation and hoped they won bruh I didn't know that they actually won
2 million club comin’!!!!!!
How tf did the Jungle people win the building competition? The other two nations had way better builds!
Justice for the  among us statue💪🏼
Best event I’ve ever watched ,the highlight for me was when the guys from the jungle village turned against starkiller....too realistic🥺
#Desert
By the was the guy that was trying to be king against star is Isaac he’s friends with grapeapplesause
I feel like ize used xray
The jungle king sucks… “you’re gonna get outgeared anyway” 🤓
You should not let people know where they placed until after they open supply drops
OMG ITS THE SQUID KID FROM TECHONOBLADES VIDEOS
JUNGLE FOREVER
i was routing for jungle from the start
Tbh I was big fan of desert team because they had pretty hard start but despite all of that they were giving such good vibes
I was with the desert the whole time I am really happy they won but I tought Tey would lose the war from jungle
zombie apocalypse
The zombie is so Supr cool
L
Can you take me in your civilization vid
Name of rhe mod
Jungle be like: BLITZKRIEG
I really love the part where that one guy said oh Genshin impact Hell yeah baby
One Piece reference?
Genshin impact is trash☹️😠☹️☹️😠😡🤮🤮
There should be an entire TV network devoted to minecraft content. 🙂
Pls make another one
jungle was brave
So they lost
They were just teamed on
Jungle
mow
Plz upload
I'm here when his subscribers are at 1.99 million
Can you post somtime
Jungle kindom was gonna win until star got killed by a douche bag
sipover's better
You have compitison silverisme is trying to beat you
35:55 “And you killed none of them”😟😂
5:02 This dude practically jumped on a grenade for his fellow people.
Ize is just a dirty liar he was rude and cruel.
Jungle ddat
Yes I want a second sequel
Jungle was my favorite sad they lost
When’s the next one coming up? I really wanna be in this.
We need a series of this and ur narrating 💯
Arctic had the best spirit, jungle had the best story, desert had the best destiny.
Here is an idea. It’s Avatar the last airbender based. 4 kingdoms Water Earth Fire and Air are split and each kingdom’s citizens have powers of their element. Everything else is the same but plot twist one person from one nation can control every element. If they die the next kingdom in the avatar has another random person who receives that avatar’s powers. The avatar has to go to each nation and be trained by them but they have to be careful because a nation might try to kill them for their powers. Will the avatar be peaceful or will he be a war machine to make his nation victorious? Like this comment so it will get noticed if you like the idea!
Fun Fact: when he was rating the arctic village im pretty sure the soundtrack is from mario forever lol
Yooo silver weee want more like this video pls make another one
Among Us
I liked the dessert kingdom cause they were chill and didnt commit into fighting together
Ize needed to be taken down, hard. Solo murder hobo more concerned with his own welfare than anyone else's. Guess all his big talk ended up being worth squat.
2:22 bro he roasted squid kids rank in the potato war LOL
If star was president I would have rooted for jungle
Jungle would had won if they did not have as people with no gear
road to 2 million!!!
I WANTED JUNGLE TO WIN NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
That subtle Donkey Kong music 😄
But the Forest Civilization was the Bravest Civilization that Try to kill each civilization one by one, R.I.P King of Forest..
He forgot to say that genshen impact is a dereced copy of breath of the wild
bruh the players were absolute 0 at the game with 0 iq irl, what a mess
You killed them with a ravager I set thumbs down
I liked jungle but when I knew the dark side of it I hated it,arctic was the jolly type but weak,desert was the organized and they have a zombie that's what matters
@Silver on top
i thought the jungle was gonna win not gonna lie but they decided to betray eachother which caused their downfall
Jungle def
I feel for the diamond guy
Netflix who
Starkiller sounds like a real king xD
Jungle Kingdom had a decent leader. I would have followed him!
That jungle traitor got what he deserved. Lol
The Jungle King was a better leader then the waffler.
No walls and no bunkers for a blood moon. Smh
They could have built a fortress....
Literally no walls... lava moats.... or bows and arrows? Hmmmm.
i was playing genshin imact while seeing this video lesgoo
Plz upload I miss u☹️😭😭
30:36 top 10 saddest anime deaths
Bro why you sound like that
14:33 Silver's editor must be *crying himself to sleep right now*
im still waiting for new video
Is it just me or is this guy the _only_ person who puts a timestamp for *_before and after his sponsor_* *Mad Respect.*
0:10 gotta love how it says nestor joined
Love your content, please continue doing great videos❤️
It’s like the Sea People versus the Egyptians
Desert
I absolutely loved Ize. He could have taken the boring route and just played normally, but he decided to spice things up. He made this 1000x more fun
Jungle was the best by far. They had the upper hand in literally everything except for alliances. Ize was a great leader and almost got the Jungle to destroy the entire server. Only thing is, Desert was on home turf and teaming with Arctic survivors. And still, Jungle put up a fight.
Your almost at 2M subs!!
Bro  jungles king was legit trash! He was not a good king
I am still curious as to why seup betrayed the people he took refuge in to help the person who invaded your kingdom  Tell me if I missed an important detail as to why
I was rooting for Green.
<snow town people are the best
Water protection?
24:30 nahhhh how they finna switch up like that  That's why they got clapped, Starkiller ain't deserve that
What the hell is water protection and no I have not finished this video this book made me think
You should do this in vanilla Minecraft
Anime is what fuel’s my anger.
jungle so close to win
Man i was rooting for the jungle,if only they didnt attack desert right away
“A group of 5 warriors were sent to a structure crossing rivers then eventually finding an aztec temple.”  Every nerd in social studies: ACuLALLY iTs THe MaYAn TeMPlE!
I was rooting for jungle the whole time!
i love the erthbownd music
Star killer is the good one bruh..
9:05 fat people cause a earthquake
12:39 wth mini diamondh swordh bruuuh
Jungle
reject genshin return to mgr
Ize is a true goat
"Star Killer stood up as a much needed leader after the last count got assassinated." **Wait I've seen this before.**
I liked team arctic the most, because of their among us and susmas tree
pls do more of this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"oh genshin impact oh hell yeah baby" THAT ONE GOT ME LOL
2MILLION
2MILLIPN
Me after seeing Saitama in 20 health: my time has come
This is like an entire movie
Silver: Since Multiplay, everyone lives peacefully literacy me: DUDE! MAN UP AND GO TO A RANDOM SERVER WITH ACCIDENTAL FIRE ENABLED!
The jungle lost because of ize,he was cocky,rude and forcing others
35:50 "and you guys kill none of them"  Followed up with "gosh"  Jesus it's 4 am rn I can't be laughing so hard. I wasn't expecting that 😂😂
Anymore?
Silver is almost hit 2M!
The arctic are just Canadians. XD.
28:02 d-day 29:52 the British are coming! 30:04 the Arctic massacre 31:23 the Arctic monarchy gets overthrown 35:47 the Arctic joins the desert 36:25 the last battle
I just wanted artic to win artic was cozy peaceful desert idk jungle kinda nad
Silver, you haven't posted in a while. I would love to see another video!
I support jungle
THE JUNGLE
My favorite team was green
jungle king was pure evil, but i hate soup for his deceiving too.
I love the genshin music in the background
how do you make these biome split maps
HAPPY 2M
Happy 2M
im kinda glad jungle didnt win 😂
jungle was cool until they killed star
Ize was a brilliant military leader who can rally troops easily and if he was just the general while starkiller was the king, Jungle would have absolutely won. However, assassinating Starkiller and taking the role of King allowed his hubris and war-hungry nature to consume him and led to his nation's downfall.
Play
I would like to p!at
Just starting and I think arctic will win
respect to jungle
you should make the sequel in the nether. maybe modify it so overworld stuff can be found there, but it should still be the same players as last time. the story being that they all died and now are ghosts. if they die again they will be banished to the end. but they'll still fight each other in the nether after some mandatory grace period. this would also be a good springboard for part 3, which could lead to a part 4 depending on if the frame in the deep dark biome turns out to be a portal to a 4th dimension.
I was expecting siege battle
I liked jungle the best
genshin inpact? More Like Gayshit Infact
Ize was right his people were just naive
20:42
to be honest,this is the best mc civilization ever
bro iza_ become H1tl3r v2
is this on java or bedrock?
Why painful and prestonplayz is in your video
ize was the best no cap
The great soldier zombi my man
i liked the jungle leader he was realistic
Make More Videos
He’s not gonna talk about the genshin impact boss fight in liyue
Honestly I was rooting for Ize the whole time
pls post on your main channel
Nice
How does someone join this?
i loved the ved
they should give sipover some credit
Desert did not deserve to win
ize sucks
I want to try this
Zombie on rampage mode was the greatest thing ever witnessed. 😂
Irish guy from jungle is toxic AF i would leave if he was in my team
THIS VID WAS ON MY 11TH BDAY WTF
Jungle players were so toxic and hard to watch. their leader were really annoying too, i hope we will never see him again.
I love this format of vid
I've never watched a mc video like this. Truly a masterpiece and I've subbed.
is there a server i can play this on?\
Are you speed silver?
i like jungle best
giga chad ize
0:09 the legend of technoblode the video made by technoblade. The legend is still aliveeee!!!!
His voice reminds me of Stewie Griffin
sky news
YOU split them into teams, i want to see 150 people put into a world, and they decide their teams, they decide if they want war, they build their countrys, they make their civilization  just putting 150 peolpe in the world and see what happens, who forms teams, who doesnt
I swear to le monke bro this was a barrel of laughs 😂😂 Subbed
ize is rlly annoying
this is some game of thrones level of battle
“and you guys killed none of them?” “gosh”  THAT TOOK ME OUT FHRKNRKEMDKD
the jungle’s the best omfgg
my faourite was jungle because i love pandas and pandas live in jungles
That jungle dude was so annoying
Imagine being with your team for like hours and supported them, then a Irish guy just pops out of nowhere and people vote for him instead
Ize was fearless and well equipped for battle but when it can to it he was an idiot 😂
I love how starkiller was brutally murdered by the government
Amazing. Never seen anything this good in minecraft. Outstanding.
Ize is so mean
How can I join these events?
35:43 that dude was literally me
Fs in the chat for starkiller.
21:00 they know how to build up?
JUNGLE SHOULD WIN
This should be called a “film”
bruh i had high hopes for the jungle. too bad they were outnumbered.
Hihihihihihihihihihihi
the greatest tactic in war, is suprise
the forest kingdoms like julet and ceasora ancient greece society lol
When the Green army invaded the arctic it was just like Napoleon invading Russia.
My favorite was arctic but im just happy jungle didn’t win in the end.
When are you gonna uploud the next vid.
Please make more 100 days vidz that what made me sub😁😁😁
Dude...Jungle was litterally a mix of ancient Rome and Great Britain! Anyone else see that? Edit: If you have read the book Animal Farm...its pretty much the same thing or at least very close
when is next vid
I loved the jungle kingdom, felt like a tv show, a lot of drama and character development
Poor artic it was so wholesome
ayo is it just me or is ize a horrible leader also I think it's smarter to have a constitutional government instead of a dictatorships
We need more videos like this :)
I liked most the jungle but rip
star u should  taken his armour
Achievement unlocked: *back from the dead*
He said second *cough* technoblade
I was rooting against Jungle from the beginning because I felt like they had it easier (and I love an underdog), but when they became warmonger-y I was definitely dead against them.   Was rooting for Arctic to win first because they were the furthest behind but then right at the end when Soup betrayed Desert and helped King Izi, I was then rooting for Desert and was glad they won
gg
I'm a. squid kid is there!! From potato war from technoblade!!!
This is one of the best Minecraft video I've seen, this channel has easily became one of my favourite Minecraft channel

Hi Jacob it’s me misha from school your blowing up good job
WE NEED MORE OF THIS
man jungle should’ve split to desert and arctic but they forgot “chat” was a thing  Edit: imagine this in realism
What happens to the skyblock vids?
2:25 @technoblade was about to say hold up
This was so enjoyable to watch and it was like real life but without all the actual killing. I’d love to see more of this type thing
Make new videos pls pls
A moment of silence for Starkiller, he was a true leader.
Arctic: Susmas and Ice Jungle: Emeralds and Pandas Desert: Silver and Necromancy
28 5 was d day
He hasn't posted in 3 months I'm worried for him.
Bro Ize is a definition of a dictator
40:08
5:00
Bro why are these mysterious players harassing jungle
The jungle nation kinda reminded me of Lord of the flies and how chaotic it got Lord of the flies took place in a forest type island  Coincidence? I think not
I rlly liked this video, and my favorite civilisation Arctic
The zoom wow got me so u got a new sub
I unsubscribed just because ur promoting genshin impact

RGVHTG
E
Clash of clans

Good content.
Actually nobody kills the cow because that's an entity they don't name it it will disappear in no time so nobody kill it so fun that's a fun fact hehe
Gimme like a year or so, I’ll be there, I’ve just gotta get a pc
I would of loved to play on a server this big
Ize is probably the most annoying person I've ever seen. Yes, "person", not "player".
I am a normal kid I don't like genshin impact and I am not a weird kid that haven't seen the sun in years and you ruined this entiere epic video with the things of genshin impact
Will you do more of this Also i found the leadership of the jungle really shitty Like the person who attacks first always dies at the end, they should have waited till 1 team remaind so that they could outnumber and kill the team
Pls play hypixel sky block
Pls make a video pls
The arctic team were so wholesome… too bad they were slaughtered
Jungle
Make video for your face came
Jungle is best !
Jungle king made s really good points and both wise and strange decisions. Taking away a big mouth yet powerless leader is a great point, that simulation was about last nation surviving so peace was never an option. Killing him was ruthless, tho necessary, you don't need a civil war going on while you're at war. Blitzkrieg against weakest participants was the right move, not a single junglian dead, neat. But the fact that they couldn't kill all artics made everything shatter. First of all they should have regrouped, advanced their gear even more, they knew the coordinates of deserts, and could sneak somewhere getting everyone full armor and such, but they decided to lean on individual, which was a bad idea. That strong unit should have been used as in previous fight, covered by tons of smaller units, not acting like a hero. Good strategy in their case may be start a partisan war, taking down deserts one by one, maybe even in a few days. Another option is to make a second big battle, where they had all chances. Using various factors such as mobs, explosions, maybe even lava or something. Good move from arctitcs to kill a jungle traitor, they couldn't know what was on his mind, tho seemingly he may not have betrayed them. And deserts just didn't do anything, having a full force, not fatigued by war they just could face the attack
Please make More Civilization Videos Silver I Love thease Keep It Up 🔥 - from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰
'Sice the dawn of Minecraft Multiplayer, players have lived peacefully.' 2b2t, Lifesteal SMP etc : Am I a joke to you?
Man, Jungle team was literally every toxic kid reunited.
What happened to Silver??
Can bedrock players join ????
My favorite was the Jungle! I was really hoping that they would win!!
Say whatever you want about Ize he was like the charismatic antagonist that you’re secretly rooting for
Pls make more videos of this😄
starkiller over ize
I liked the desert because they were os together and doing every work in team
Rip starkiller and I hate the tyrant if the jungle. And ZOMBIE POGGGGG
I like jungle
Why you talk like the chills guy
I liked the jungle region but that was before the dark times.........
The jungle lore is so good lmao
What I would have done 1.become warior 2.become aritic 3.become build wall 4.become king 5.aliance w/ desert 6.no jungle
That kid that got murdered in the desert 100% was a spy
That zombie : I still have one job that isn’t done 😎😎
The problem with the Arctic is that they focused on decorating their village instead of focusing on getting gear. That’s why Starkiller wasn’t gonna be a good leader. He had good leadership but he didn’t focus on getting gear to kill people. Ize was a great king with not so great leadership but brilliant mind. But unfortunately the lack leadership lead to his death.
5:51 WOOOO I CAN FEEL THE PAWA
awww, arctic died
loved arctic but when their general started to get cocky and killed the jungle refugee guy, well, i've changed my mind i was absolutely disgusted when he started helping ize
That husk tho🤜🤣🤣🤣
DO anotherone please
NEW VIDEO
Is it possible for ppl to play ur custom end mod
anyone miss the old speed silver content, i prefered the skyblock gameplay over this, i feel like youve just copied other people instead of doing oyur own thing and continuing on with the skyblock videos
Im challenging you do it with 1000 player!
Desert is my fiv bec i want to be a urban if im grown up
Hey silver I have a vid idea beat the game with only wood tools
I liked jungle most
part 2 let's go
aaww i cant join the next video lol im 12 lol
Ize the most annoying power trippy mf I ever met
2:21 Squid Kid deserved better…       Some people won’t understand…
Jungle turned into a dictatorship
The best strategy available to the jungle nation would have been to not attack and continue improving gear and maybe even set up traps around their capitol and build some kind of big tall building made purely for defense. If they had done this then they would have had a super high chance at winning. It’s three factions so the third faction standing has the advantage especially in their own territory
Solidarity is more important than power politics. Not the king of one person, but the glory of the team.
I feel bad for star killer he would be a good leader
yo silver you aight bud? u havent posted anything in a while..
Fun fact: mobs and wars killed 88% of all people, Even though Desert won, the world was empty and doomed.
The desert kingdom was my favroite
35:52 comedy gold
5:44 This is not a diamond, it's a lapis lazuli.
Arctic was by far the best looking town, trash vote, and wtf is even that reward...
Artic: no strong leaders breed weak nation  Jungle: small group of strong ambitious leaders breed a dictatorship  Desert: groups of (perhaps) average-strong players and agreeable members breeds the strongest nation    And also tactical advantage. It is always harder to breach than to defend, especially after the element of surprise is lost
Jungel was ruthless and savage
I would love to play minecraft this, so jelly of the people who got to participate in this
God bless King Ize, mans is a Legend ngl, no matter what happened Id follow that man, he knows what he is doing
Jungle leader was annoying asf was happy when he died
hello my good sir I was just wondering if I can able to join one of your servers sometime soon I would love to be with the 100 days or 100 players please notify me if you can
I want to join but im Bedrock:(
Ize the absolute chad
Ize might just be the worst “leader” I’ve ever seen
Hi are you the guy that love playing agar.io years ago??
Where video
How does one get in to these games?
Funny how they thought arctic had a civil war when they’re the most peaceful out of all them especially jungle
do another video like this but on the ice and fire mod
EVERYONE JackTBC chain!
If Ize was smart with the invasion and play it safely then the jungle team would have won 🏆
WAIT WHAT!!! this man made a video someone else had done and got MORE VIEWS THAN HIM!!! magicgum did it first and got 5mil views, this man did it 1 month after and got 10mil views... Why does this happen?
I don't know about you guys, but I loved Ize's character as a power-hungry leader. I didn't like the stuff he said but ultimately, he just wanted to win. He wanted the glory of winning in a hard-fought battle, but still he died trying. Although many of us outsiders did not like him, most of his followers fought until the end, showing that although they didn't agree with him at the start, they were with him until the end. None of his soldiers ran away from the battle, at least that's how I saw it.
Omg...that was brutal and beautiful
You forgot to add credits  -Nintendo, Desert, Jungle, and Mario Bros. U snow soundtracks
Was xnesterio playing?
Ize = Putin
The trixyblox pyramid💀
My favorite line of them all before ize rose to power: "I know, but you've been talking them up like you're Jim Jones for 40 minutes"  A shame Jungle couldn't win, but ize was probably one of my favorite figures of the bunch
I hate the jungle guy who went solo
9:08 oh genshin impact hell yeah
COME BACK TO SKYBLOCK PLEASE
General soup. 1.Cared for his people 2.lost everything to the jungle and developed a hatred that caused him to commit several warcrimes 3. Hatred for the enemy turned into greed and a desire to win  4. Betrayed the desert and teamed up with the most dangerous man on the server despite of the pain he caused. And died like a fool. *Truly a tragic villain*  EDIT: wtf 1k likes????
That Desert Zombie side arc is one of the greatest comeback stories I've ever watched. Also yeah I was rooting for Desert Kingdom from the beginning.
You should return to skyblock and make a mini series on stranded but theres like a twist, for example if you die you delete the profile and restart sorta like hardcore. I miss the skyblock vids on the other channel
Desert
Please part 2
Need part2
The best potato farma- Wait I read that wrong. The second best potato farmer
Jungle
Poor Squidkid
this man silver fr don’t know that genshin is a giant botw clone, still good video
"eveyone jump if you like genshin impact" "everyone jumps" ey look more people on my hit list, wonderfull!                   this is clearly sarcastic
When will he upload again
You are a good narrerator
and i liked most desert and artic bc of that susy baka XD
Mr. Jungle Painter
can i join in to the next 100 Players Simulate Civilization in Minecraft video??
I like desert
33:17 literally the plot of Wasteland 3
Hello bto
I missed your videos...
Hey bro when is this guy gonna upload
THE GENSHIN MUSIC
i would be a farmer in the jungle and live a peaceful life getting a ton of food to everone. probably
Can do something like this in your video
Ize got that no father figure kinda attitude. I wonder how it would sound having his teeth stomped in?
it is mode
I enjoy more calm nations but without nations like the jungle who are more chaotic and bloodthirsty, how would there be conflict, I was rooting for the desert, because they were so organized, but i thought that the jungle would purely outgear them
I feel bad for the jungle guy that wanted to join arctic if I had a king like that I to would defect
Why did you stop making videos I am so sad 😭😭
technically the temple would be Mayan
"people will vote for a king" that has to be the second dumbest thing I've seen in this video
If i follow u on twitter on my other tab can i have creative I WANNA BUILD =3 pwease
35:00, dunno what to think, he deserved it for betraying like a bitch but ice was not cool killing him like that
Ur de best   Ps: I love this content
Its like 2ww… britain is desert, germany is dschungle, frost is france
Oh genshin impact hell yeah baby😂😂😂😂
Hi silver can I join for free please 🥺😨
I have 32 vids and i only have 57 subs :(
I like the jungle team
hey man, i know your focusing on this channel now but, i really want you to upload more hypixel skyblock content. thanks
You have to add lions plz🥺
When will next video come?
I was already rooting for the dessert from the beginning so I'm happy that they won... they have such a wise and organize king tho they were such naives.. ^^ it's fine, being naive is fine as long as you are quick to read the situation and act according to that. Amazing for dessert. The ending was anticlimactic^^
Man i liked this video so much
it’s been a LONG time since i’ve watched a 40 minute youtube video start to finish
Never invade snowy countries.
Bro I don't know what you are working on but I want a fucking video
pls make new video
2:22 lol technoblade gang
I was rooting for the desert clan! They had a guy bring the zombie to the base via boat! The amount of time that must have took!
I liked arctic its sad that they got eliminated this easily
Ize was just a prick who bullied his team into submission
Days two and three are real life. The great bullian famine killed people in Europe and then the Spanish went and attacked The Aztec empire.
I wanted jungle to win
This narrative format is the best I've found out of all the mcciv vids out there. Sad that this is the only one right now. Subscribing, but only if you make more like this!
star killer: helps with village and does stuff like that Ize:grinds for all the time comes up from surface then hes mean  me: how does he get elected king?????????????????
I Liked Junglee mosst
Well sadly they didn't bring Techoblade
35:05 that kid deserved everything that came his way, man was a simp for starkiller who only had sweet talking.
Arctic：Poland Jungle：Nazi Germany Desert：Soviet or USA
Please🙏🙏🙏
Make more like this videos
Plzzzzzzz
Make more like this
I like the jungle kingdom
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO jungle lost
Man, the Power-System of Nen from HunterxHunter  would be Beyond Perfect  for these Simulation-Videos,  but unfortunately, i fear Mod's for this are under-developed.
At 25:06 Silver said that a player from the desert was caught off guard by a creeper but a phantom killed him
artic was the best
Zombie abstrekt is OP
WHATS MAKING ME HYPE BECAUSE OF THE BACKGROUND MUSICCCCHAHSHAHAJANDGUDSVAMAIHSBDODHS
Lol I keep seeing Ize would have made a great general with Star as the leader. I disagree, Ize's personality would not have allowed him to follow anyone. Even if commands would have been dictated to him by an elected leader, he would, with his followers, defied the laws and gone their own way. Eventually the dynamic between Star and Ize would have ended in civil war or assassination. The two of them were not going to be able to work together because Ize's ambition, greed, and superiority complex
A perfect representation of what happened when i came from school and we all needed toilet
Jungle
Ngl you have to respect jungles war tactics it was basically 2 nation vs 1
XD desert was my favorite the Arctic were a bunch of cowards and the jungle were basically the axis powers (i was gonna say na zi but don’t wanna risk it)
That guy that got enchants is super greedy and stupid Star Killer was the best king and and the guy that has diamonds did not deserve to be king and all he wanted was power I could tell by the tone
I love this video it so sad that war started but I love the video keep making more!!
The guy that dragged the zombie half across the world? He's the true MVP. That zombie player was a hidden card that changed the tides of battle!
Please make civilization competition in rl craft mod🙏🙏 BTW vid was awesome as always🙏
Arctic, PERIOD.
George Lucas would hate to watch this video
Silverrrrr, are you ded? It’s been two monthsss
You should make this like a weekly event or something cause this seems really cool
RobbieMcfly being absolutely criminal
That’s what a shit leader gets you
My favourite is The jungle, their king is barbatic brutal and insane, starkiller just gonna let his people eat a carrot if he be the king
Favorite civilization video so far :)
God bless spread Gods word and his name is doing but someday you will know repent and turn away from your sin and follow Jesus Christ and put your faith in him and he loves you and so do I no matter what your going through God is right there with you no matter what God bless God makes everything with a purpose you have a purpose put God first  and he will give you peace  and the desires.of your heart God bless and serve others and always be nice to others stay Blessed

I really hoped the junglr civilization would win
To be fair I liked the Jungle and Dessert but I wanna see another one bro this was so entertaining and enjoyable thx silver for another great video
Jungle
,
Anyone gonna talk about star killer's betraytion
Ww2 in nutshell
Xtreme respect to jungle kingdom, especially the king maynn, Jungle Kingdom>>>>>>
Ize being so toxic, I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did
I’m surprised none try to start a republic
Yes! Dessert won but I want a continuous series about them
Geez, Ize is an absolute *TYRANT* - I'd have left and asked the other factions if they'd grant me asylum if I were in this
Did anyone else get the peat doson add
"The best warrior" isn't the best king.
I liked the forest civilization
Idea:  3 faction/civilization But one is overworld two is underground (dwarf) Three is start in to the Nether (demon)  (Sorry for my english)
I liked the jungle kingdom when it was under the rule of king star killer. Once things changed I started leaning towards the sand kingdom. The snow kingdom was too peaceful to win this competition
I wanted artic to win
It’s almost like each civilization has it easier or harder depending on where they live! How original!
That jungle king was the Hitler.
Arctic guys got revenge
I m going to ad you as a friend in minecraft
*technoblade: excuse me?*
I do but I don't do adult stuff like twitter and facebook and stupid stuff like that
can i get ip?
Ize planned sucked. He was cocky and threatened to kill his teammates who had negative views about him. As well forced them to fight just doing what he wanted. He as well planned an assassination on one of his teammates just for the crown. At the start all he did is help him self went off to do his own thing leaving his teammates behind to make the base as well as them helping each other out. Ize just showed he is selfish, as well stupid to loose the trust of members that wanted to change team bc of him. Honestly if I was on the Jungle team I would want to change team as well, he showed no leadership. Gaining power at the start by doing his own thing leaving the others to help each other through the events.
Genshin impact moment :
i like Jungle when Star was ter leader
Make  a new video pls
other 100 day hardcore on other YouTuber: hello guys (37 minute later) YouTuber:OMG we have found the boss guys silver hardcore: (1hour videos every day)
i like the artic
The jungle was perfect, but the king just ruined it
You know what, Ize made it interesting.
Dude this video is fucking awesome. This is exactly the shit I always imagined in participating inside of Minecraft
Im not sure if i quite agree with how they chose their kings
More
Guys just let me be in total charge and it's an easy win
I love the supermario music
9:03 Another fatherless child
Do 8000000000 people next
Honestly I thought that the jungle would win because of their strong gear but because of most of the players not trusting ize they kept their civilization back and let more die on the blood moon
There should be a engineering class
This would make such a great game mode
I believe Ize was a great leader. He was doing the not so right thing for the right reason. It's people with his intensity that made the North win the Civil War. Lincoln wanted a fierce determined general. If Star killer stayed leader, the Jungle would have been caved in by the Snow kingdom and Desert kingdom
Hy
This is by far the coolest video on youtube. Thank you so much.
I liked the old jungle kingdom. The one who would of had star killer as there leader!
Bro please give your nametag
I was rooting for the Arctic to win. Yeah I did not like the Jungle’s strategy
nope
My guy owned squid kid Lol
https://youtu.be/yF7zTDRl8ZQ
Star killer bothered them shit out of me
Bro post on your sky block account more
By far one of the best Minecraft videos
ngl ize is like stalin SO INSECURE BROOO
Dessert
Such a cool video! Good job man, awesome characters.
I rioted for dessert and got nervous for my favorite nation at arctics destruction but yay I was correct
The king of the jungle kingdom is literally Macbeth
I genuinely disliked the jungle colonization this time around and especially about Ize,I understand that he was purely about combat and conflict and being the one in control and the best and shit but it's just a fun minecraft event and he's acting like it's his job,he just felt like he was such a selfish and vindictive person but he wasn't putting on an act. It doesn't matter how good of a strategist you or or how good you are at something if you're a terrible person who would literally sacrifice your most charismatic leader for self greed
That Jungle King is Toxic AF! Lmao!
I chose jungle cuz u support their build so much but backfired 😂
I was gonna subscribe to you until you mentioned gayshit impact...
This was the best piece of minecraft i have ever experienced
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiJhUm7HFRWLHL1S5gI95WA?sub_confirmation=1
i made this
This like a minecraft reality tv show 😂
I hate the eye king of the jungle because he was a Joffrey wanna be from Game Of Thrones.
Lol that intro for Squid Kid bro. Technoblade never dies!
That Ize player is the biggest type of asshole in this world.. if that’s what thousands of years of evolution leads to, I don’t want it.
i liked jungle the best
https://youtu.be/FxZXCxixEOI  Imagine copying
this is good content
the true enemy wasnt the jungle, it was just ize. Also desert was the best civilization, although they werent as peacefull as the artic ,they never started any war unless they were provoked, plus they had the better leader  also respect for the guy in 34:54 for not believing in Ize's bs
UunSub because arctic got this’d sorry
What does it take to be part of these? it sounds so fun.
I love how the zombie went after the jungle and ignored the desert players and got the kill on the jungle “king/leader”
*caught getting rid of body (gear) in chests* “How’d that guy die?” “Um bug,*hides leg sticking out in chest* lag maybe”
Jungle has disappointed me
upload on ur other channel pls i miss ur skyblock videos. but if u find this more fun its whatever
why did u stop posting on your speedsilver channel?
what happened to your speedsilver channel?
Yes you sponsor genshin but we don't have the dendro playable character -_-
Thoughts in the civilizations: Spoilers         The desert people were pretty chill, i liked their builds. The Jungles guys were ok, star was nice but he was naive, so I think that Ize was the best kind of leader in this situation. The Arctic ones were the ones I liked best at first because of their peaceful sus village, but when suep betrayed the desert I was kinda disappointed in him.
bro when will you upload your next video
Arctic battle was not even fair jungle king played dirty and wiped most of them
Are you all good? Its been a while since you uploaded i suspect either you got somthing big coming or somthing happend
If it wasn't for that ice dude the jungle woulda one
jungle
DEAD CHANNEL LMAAAOAOAOAOA
Can u post again on speedsilver pls
Arctic people deserve a second chance next time with three more players alive.
The Vietnamese civilization all chose (rice) farmer class & still managed to win the conflict for their nation's survival.
I want another pls 😁
PLSSS map download link
Love from when you played skyblock <3
mvp was the desert zombie
It's funny how everyone just automatically label the person with the crown as the leader. It's not like they'd lose the game if the person with the crown is killed. If they were clever, they'd make the person with the crown a general instead given the health and strength boost. Ize will be the military general with his good gears while Starkiller will be in charge of logistics due to his popularity. As for the leader, it should go to someone who wants to achieve the goal. Not someone who wants to rule.  Honestly, Ize and Starkiller is a reflection of modern day politicians. One is an egotistic person who think they should rule because they believe themselves to be stronger. The other is an outspoken person who think the person with the most favor should rule. This isn't a body building contest nor is it a popularity contest. The goal is to survival and defeat the other teams. Something that both Ize and Starkiller is neither capable of doing.
Uuu
Kind of reminds me of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Jungle is Cao Cao, Artic is Liu Bei, and Desert is Sun Quan. Cao Cao attacks Liu Bei and Liu Bei join up with Sun Quan to defeat Cao Cao at Chi Bi.
Make more videos
Jungle kingdom's king is like a demon who will kill or torture anyone for  power
The genshin impact back sound  Is so good
14:46 everywhere i go his is there watching menacingly....
that elytra shit was op you shouldnt let king get them.
Winter clan
MmMMMMMMMMMMmMmMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM WHY DESERT
Man i really love that zombie
The real winner here is the jungle civilisation and u can’t convince me differently
Artic: happy Christmas people  Jungle: anger chaos
Does anyone else feel like he was telling a horror story when the jungle pillaged the arctic
@22:00 democracy in the 18th century
where did the intro come from?
@14:28 “ummmm no!” 😂 mission failed
My favorite was arctic, since the susmas tree and the among us statue lol
I was rooting for Jungle the whole second half xD
Silver: and then 3 players that were underground starved. That one player that died by a zombie: am I a joke to you

Fear really change a lot of things in a very fast amount of time unexpectedly.  Great video love to see another one again!
I love how the remaining jungle guy survived because he just got really lost.
I was looking at YouTube and I got one of your speedsilver videos recommend. Those were the good days.
Great job on the vid! And yes, I do think there should be a sequel to this series, and there should be like an ocean nation and a cave nation for ideas
Technoblade is already on you..
make some more videos
Bro that zombie of that dead player at the end was def a morale boost Xd
bruh silver youare a genius
hes not growing subs a lot anymore Maybe he should get a life?
The Mario sound track is 🤌✨🔥
jungle would win if they hadn't such idiots and trators
I'd hide in a hole
The jungle army is very strong, but the king is very evil like the fascists . And the other two armies are more in harmony with each other and more sociable
I Firstly watched it so cool 10/10 I subbed omg how cool
Speed come back to hypixel skyblock pls! I love you!

Where are you
I’m so glad Ize lost, he was so unlikable and absent minded, didn’t think about anything else
Ize is the kinda person id beat the fuck up in real life, what a narcissist
i loved the jungle civilization XD
"Honesly i liked the guy but good thing he died" Dayun
I think Starkiller should have stayed leader and Ize should of been the leader of the jungle’s warriors but damn was that whole thing so good
I wanted arctic to win
Can u make a new vid I check your channel every day and there’s no new vid
Y'all this vid was rockin

Ayo timedoe is in here
Can someone join after
2 jungle king was tyrannical
When do you post a new vid
Abstrecky was the funniest mob I've ever seen
ngl I was rooting or jungle but after starkiller was murdered I was all for desert
Personally was a fan of Democratic Jungle
I preferred Arctic, it was a shame they got killed first
No one gonna talk about how im_a_squid_kid is the second best hypixel potato farmer? Or was I don’t know I only know from technos videos
Ngl I like #1 artic #2 desert #3 jungle
soooo god
I like how the last jungle member was on it's own in the jungle and was task to kill the remaining 11 desert kingdom on his own
i was cheering for the arctic kingdom and moved on to cheer for the desert. i never liked the jungle kindgom!
Jungle civilization were the antagonistic/final boss while the desert were the protagonist looking to end their rain of terror if you will
I was so lad that jungle went down. but I felt bad for the villagers ize was so blid to see that he was ruining his nation. also rip to te artic they were my fav kindom
yo did anyone see thaat nestro was in the video when they spawnd
2:15 , is noone gonna talk about that?
bro that guy who defended starkiller should have been accepted into the desert kingdom and now i feel bad for him
Bro i love these types of videos u did a great job thank you
How did the arctic get 3rd in the building event they did really good5
“I would rather be a good man than a great king.”-Thor. Star was a good man and a great king. Ize was neither. I’m glad he failed
Ize: I gave you an enchanting table Starkiller only repeats the same 6 things   Ize: Proceeds to say that his army is the problem not him after he swam away instead of helping them fight and when they retreat instead of dying threatens them, which they believed which was their stupidest mistake Ize wasn’t gonna slaughter half of his people
the jungle kingdom was by far the least decorated town. no decorated farm resource, no decorated mine, no decorated extras like the snows ice ring. wtf possessed you to voting first for it.
Hey speedsilver i was watching you when you had 4k subs, watching your streams when you where on hupixel. Good times, i hadn't watched any minecraft content since your last video on your first channel. So today i wanted to check out what you were doing on the channel and i found that you hadn't uploaded since the last video i watched. I found out about this channel and i want to say that i am really sad, really REALLY sad. At first there was wisp who started this whole minecraft rp and challenges shit and then you. I never expected that since i thought you always loved hypixel and you really seemed to enjoy playing. I even hate how you talk now i don't know why, how old are you? Fucking 19 or something? I just think this all shit is weird. All the old uhc and skyblock creators i used to watch now make this type of content because it gets stupid amounts of views. But hey, do whatever the fuck you want just be happy pls
This is like Game of Thrones
Who remembers when he posted here https://www.youtube.com/c/SpeedSilverMC
Ize was the most annoying player in this civilzation video. Im genuinely glad he lost. Hes so annoying
Ize made this so entertaining
I liked jungle
Arctic: We don't know who to vote, let's just vote the guy with an accent lmao Desert: very organized, they even had a throne  ...  Jungle: MONKE STRONG DIAMMOND KING
Are u gonna post anymore dude i really liked ur content :(
Better plot than any recent movie. Worth to watch.
Who are the natived
The jungle king is a Buzz kill in the content down right A Hole ! Bet his charming in person ( NOTTTTT!) Serves him right they lost !
I dont even play minecraft but i'd love to play a game like this
When is another one of these gonna happen?
Ize may have been a contemptible leader but dang if he wasn't an effective commander.  That said though I was really pulling for Suep's little Arctic Resistance at the end though.
More manhunt please
ice was the beast
I liked the jungle
Is it me or did the guy who died in second was an audio from bam 🤣🤣
Guys we need to silver to 2mill tell your freinds family anyone just get this man to 2mill
Subscribed. This is the best mc civilization video I’ve seen. Please make more of these
How do I get in one
Bro ize is the arggiesve and wanna tale over the two kingdom and no leader ship and no teamwork the jungle kingdom almost won but to greedy they lost the war
what is the mad
New video?
Imagine you're dying and the last thing you hear is a kid yelling have you heard of genshin impact?
It feels like I just finished a nerve-wracking series finale.
How do I join 100 player servers like this??
Bruh Genshin is a cheap copy of botw why you supporting copying?
I was routing for Arctic
watching the "fearsome" jungle players suddenly make a 180 into pleading for their lives when in deep danger was a bit surprising while also amusing
uhh is he coming back or is he getting some milk still?
what up xnestorio🙂
Ize embodies stereotypical fast talking Irish bully who thinks speeding through challenges and insults makes him better than you. Not a healthy mindset if you're trying to be elected and not force yourself as leader dude
Like the desert just a normal civilization
I like desert by the fact that they were got little resourses and still managed to survive and also the zombie killing the last jungle player lol
Ize is a great leader he could’ve taken down artic with just his 10 people
Ize was a huge dictator but he lead upgraded his civilization and lend them he is like an antihero
The guy who spent a half hour boating his zombie teammate to the Desert village was the MVP. The zombie helped them not once, but *TWICE* in taking out key players.
that zombie that killed the genshin impact person was a chad
Who is warrior.. I'm warriors x 5 lol
a masterpiece
im joning these... when i get mc java ofc.
9:08 uh yea thats really um.. nvm
Woow Just Woow
Nooooooo jungle is not 1st place i want desert
I liked the Artic the most and I honestly thought the Desert people would die off first
Please next video is skyblock civilization 😅👌
Ize reminds me of Tao Thao or Hitler
Dude I thought the vid will be lame. but deym this is a lot for a single vid  🔥🔥
Silver be kinda quite past 2 months 😭
i feel bad for the guy that gave the whole town an enchantment table and the town just turned him down right after 😭 tbh i wouldve never trusted that town.
6* elements so far
After seeing this, another biome or faction Id be interested in is Mountains. That or perhaps a Plains with very sparse trees. Only because having 3 factions, means 1 group would have a player more than others. That may not seem like a lot, but that is also one more life for their kingdom, another person to grow crops, mine ores, or defend their people. 4 factions would be an even 25 per, and may lead to alliances between nations if possible. Just a thought.
Good content I think this is very interesting I should try this. Tv Ka raged
I was rooting for the jungle nation as well
bro your voice💀💀
It honestly makes sense because in the building event the ranks went; 1. Jungle, 2. Desert, 3. Arctic. Jungle got way too cocky and decided to initiate war first, while the arctic were too naive and too peaceful. The desert were careful and only engaged in battle after being attacked first. That’s probably why they won :-)
Ize carried this
Please make another one I’m begging you
I spent this entire video hoping Ize would get merked. It serves jungle right for going along with that shite excuse for a leader
f in chat for jungle
what would happen if some of a certain group became separatists and just kind of moved away?
Bruh jungle was straight up conspurasionist terrorism
I liked the jungle kingdom
Jungle
Man...an alchemist could have ended this quekley
ngl i loved the jungle village
Me and all my homies hate ize
Jungle >
Seemed like a cool video until that genshin impact sponsor appeared. Anyways time to dislike and leave
What an amazing video & content keep it up <3
skeppy ripoff
Why did you steal the thumbnail from MagicGum?
i liked the jungle most
25:18 the execution💀
More more more more moreeeee pleaseee
to all genshit impact players how abt you impact your life
genshit impact
Silver, do you collab with Tommyinnit in his 150.000 dollars hunger game?
The jungle kings a bitch
rip the jungle kingdom
Silver : *Kill all 11 of them to win* JackTBC : Pretty easy.  *proceeds to get captured and killed by a zombie*
bruh most of these players are literally youtubers
Can i join?
The jungle leader got that IRA spirit
Man I'm so glad jungle lost-
Ize became leader not be trust but by fear. That’s dictatorship not leadership
Hey this is the genshin impact region theme song!
you should make skyblock videos again
The final jungle guy was just zoro
How do u get your mods
Artic was way better
Artic
We need more videos likes this MPRE
17:00 I LOVE THIS MUSIC
The king of jungle was stupid
Jungle is my favourite
Glad I get to watch minecraft war instead of actual war
Om1lo
This guys voice always sounds like he has a cold
You sound like stewie
The jungle kingdom had so good dictator
Bro this was like a movie . Amazing job
Jungle
5:00 he was a hero who sacrificed his self for his teammate
Let’s get silver to 2mil
Goated ending. Fuck the jungle kingdom
L VIDEO L SPONSOR
Arectic I like Vikings
The best part of the vid was the death of ice. He was so annoying
9:07 "Genshin impact, oh hell yea baby!" IM DEAD
I WAS ROOTING FOR JUNGLE NOOOOOOOOOOO
Crown Le Zombie Desert Player!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! also R.I.P King eyes
This is like what happens in Avatar but without the Avatar entirely.
ARTIC
8:30 27 jungle players 8:31 29 jungle players wtf?
Go earth!
Star killer should of been king
I like it
More plz
Not gonna lie I clicked on this video by accident but am happy I did, love this so much, on the edge of my seat hahaha
can u do minecraft manhunt with wisp and jagster
skeppy stealing thumbnail ;-;
This is the best minecraft story that I ever seen....I wonder if I can join to but i only have minecraft bedrock 😭
squid kid got roasted!!!
Wil je in de volgende wereld i survival 100 dayes in dinosaur world
I love the fact that after the arctic kingdom got invaded, they changed amongus to dead amongus as a moral damage tactic
I really like Ize mainly because he made the video much more entertaining and intense. I was smiling throughout the whole video.  He is legit a 10/10 antagonist
The jungle leader is really unlikeable ngl
How do you get in pls respawnd
I liked desert kingdoms . Not because they win , but because they are in desert !
Use is like that one dousing who ask to play ur iPhone non stop
The jungle dude in full diamond is the prime example of brits being not fun to work with
My favorite was desert. They were organized and functioned like a successful group. Jungle was really cool when you’re watching from the outside, but too much backstabbing went on.
Video was aight but could be much better
You get far too involved and their shouldn’t be a border. Also the events piss me off, just let players be players
hey man are you coming back to skyblock?
I hope the Irish guy was just playing a character. Though he ended up playing a good villain though failing in the end while the Snow General was just a idiot when he tried helping out the Jungle King in the end.
I was watching your channel while playing Genshin impact, then I saw the sponsor and I was so confused.
Better than game of thrones
I now hate Izel
We need more things like this!
I remember when you had 1 vid and 100k subs
Who is thr best patato farmer?
The jungle king led them to their deaths star wouldn't have done that
A mis him wer is hi :(
Wer is silver am so worid abaut  him wer is hi
Never rooted for someone's death as much as the jungle king fella
YES DESERT WON
When is the new vid coming out
More pls
Copy
Abstract zombie was the deserts secret weapon. Huh Cool
That was epic
Speed did you buy subscribers? Or views even? Your new channel has 1.9 million already and your lowest viewed video is 1.1 million
I want part 2
Perfect
I love the Mario music😁
Nooo jungle.😭
Rip seup he was a warrior tho he killed ally jungles he was still a warrior
Ize is so annoying
You almost ripped that video you didn’t even mention outside your description word for word that’s sad to see bigger YouTuber steal ideas without giving proper credit
ize is a literal dictator 😭
Wait xNestorio in this
Damn i eas hoping for the jungle
Yo Shark I love your videos
Yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and yes yes lol yes yes and
YES YES YES YES YES
The fact Is Malaysia Is op
cool
ize= Genghis Khan
Man, there’s always that horrible guy who kills a nice guy
I like the jungle king he isn't scared of anything and always takes the risks and remove the things he doesn't like I like this guy
couldn't you just leave the game for the hunger event?
Your videos are sick like cool
Just try to know minecraft is getting a big hit in youtuber civilization videos
Istg Minecraft players are getting so creative nowadays, and I mean extravagantly extra
I feel bad for ice
I love that you use genshin music in this video
I can tell that most people that played never touched grass "grab his loot" 🤓🤓
This was so cool we need sequels to this best civilization vid I’ve ever watch
25:04 Is a phantom the same thing as a creeper?
you stole most of the ideas from ish
Fun fact i was playing genshin while watching
Jungle blitzkrieg
Loved the peaceful ess
Arcrict
I hate to bring this up damn, does ize___ was quick to implement a tactic that was seen in recent events, and then suffer the consequences for it
If Starkiller had not been assassinated, there's not telling what might've happened. Ize was a reckless general, bolstered by a success that only happened because he got lucky. Had Arctic been just a bit more prepared, his assault would have had causalities.
How do u make public servers ?
My favourite was artic but I’m glad jungle won they stuck to their morals and such they were never the aggressors tho I liked the jungle leader as a villain he was cool
yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Why not make it so they have to drink as well?
0:47 PRAISE THE MONKEY GOD
I definitely would have gotten a group of people too kill ize.
It’s scary how similar the jungles leader was to hitler. Down to the battle strategy’s
Technoblade just disliked the video 21:22
I mostly hear Genshin Impact battle music in background...
I feel like the jungle would have won of star killer stayed cuz he was doing like the desert and slowly building up
Silver come back it's been like 25 years!
Can you make a Server like this that anyone can join. Survival
Silver: and the best potato farmer, wait the second best potato farmer me: *WHEEZES BECAUSE OF THE POTATO WAR*
Plz do more of these
That one jungle king was taking everything so serious it was taking the fun out of it!!
nice video
Artict is the best
Star killer went full on generic anime mc. I lost it at 25:19.
Really interesting Minecraft video.
this video was really good
StarKiller screaming every word was the majority of his personality in a good way
bro the jungle people were like the third reich the desert people were like the allies and the snow people were france and all the other ones germany took
31:53 anyone know the texture pack being used here? Seems that it has shorter swords and a darker diamond color
Bro this is an incredible video,that took you months you've been on youtube for 2 years and you are booming! noice  Btw,how can i also come in one of your new vids?
Plisssss post more🥺plissssss
What happened to main channel?
Winter
Come one bro its been like months after this video.why dont you upload a new video?
This episode can be a Netflix serie how much it's funny to watch
Scott can you upload please I'm bored of other Minecraft players
6:38 in the middle night!
Jungle may have the power and the resources, but you can never underestimate good leadership and coordination.
I was with desert kingdom from start
love the subtle sb joke lol even know youve quit
I know I'm late. But if I was there I would still be team Star, Ize literally didn't care much about his people after being elected and forced his people into war. I'll admit Ize was pretty tactical with his strategy, but it was poorly executed and was mostly kinda improvised as they were going. But in my opinion Star would've made a better leader because of his diplomatic, rational thinking and kinda charismatic with his people
It's basically orwell's animal farm in minecraft.
The best content
the death of both Ize and SueP made my day
Throughout the whole video: At the start, I rooted for jungle 'cause of their strategies, and because of their biome. At the following, when the fatigue thing happened, I really liked arctic's strategy, and so I switched. Then jungle's previous king candidiate, star smth inspired most of his people, so I switched again. But then, I saw how happy arctic was, and their ice rinks, so I rooted for them, and because of the conflict between jungle.  It's true peace was never an option, but they could've tried to have peace within their own civilization, considering they're teammates. That guy bringing his dead teammate back showed his dedication, and so I didn't think much of it. But ofcourse, you should always expect the unexpected; So congrats to desert for winning, and the undead guy for killing them. #gg
The fact that you intervebed so often to nerf pepole was lame. Like killing the cow during the hunger event or accidentally activating the tnt trap you had set yourself.   That undermines the player's ability to overcome challenges & makes it look like you were not letting them grow.
If the entire jungle kingdom had followed their king from the start of his reign, it could've been very different. But also, they should've enchanted more and combine gear after wiping out most of the arctic
I was rooting for the jungle. Didnt like him at first but he slowly grew on me
Insane how some people are just terrible when they have even a modicum of power
Please Part 2!!!! :3
SEQUEL
Desert was kind of lucky that jungle didn’t come after them.It would have been smarter to go after desert first then Arctic.
i have been here since 1000 subs congrats on 1mil
Jungle
If I was one of the jungle players I would have just dipped and went home on the way to the arctic civilisation and went back home but when the arctic civilisation were gone i would have joined the desert civilisation.
My statements about the civilizations:  Arctic: They were the nicest and wanted to gear up, not going into war instantly. In my opinion their leader was squid.  Desert: They deserve the win, but they were outgeared. They wanted war, and they were smart, so they knew what to do when the jungle army came.  Jungle: Ize was a really important king for them. With starkiller, they would've been way more careful, but they would've not come that far. Ize was rude, but that's what was important in that case. He got his team for him. Suep and ize are great friends in my opinion, because suep tried to help him atleast and he didn't even refuse to attack his own team he switched to. A wonderful video. Thanks for making it!
2:16 I understand he had the diamonds already, but why did he just place them down while mining (acting like he found them)?
we want starkiller as leader and ize as general. they would have won together
Man, if Ize had just used his wealth to be 2nd in command to Starkiller he could have combined his ambition with Star's leadership and the invasion probably would have went alot better.
anyone realise nestorio joined
Only way the last guy could have won is with traps.
Amazing project ! I LOVE IT do more bcs it is soooo good!!!
I love when u visit the Among us statue is dead
Good video but why it feels like its nyligen boys and no girls

"why this world have no peace" basic minecraft players simulate the truth of the world :
Awesome videoo
jgl king was the worst glad he lost. arctic was my favorite <3
🥺
This was so good
I find it funny how the jungle army didn’t just grief the Among Us statue but also build a bone on top of it
Bro Abstrek joining the fight against ize was beautifl😢
18:59 "Good farm"!? That's the most inefficient farm I've ever seen!
The jungle civilization is basically plains but better because it has more resources
I have to say starkiller would have led them better
29:34
skeppy: oh i´m gonna copy this guy thumbnail me: wtf, skeppy copied
I see the Jungle leader used the propaganda techniques of 1930s germany.
The jungle leader was such a dick they didn’t choose either leaders well
more plsss
i just wanted to inform you that skeppy stole the thumbnail of this video i’l put a link https://youtu.be/TLyOFwvRnzY your video is way better tho
btw if you want to skip the add click this 3:56
where your accent come from ?
Le monke
im_a_squid_kid joined on server like If i cant be best potato farmer on sky block on hypixel il be there.I think Technoblade still chase him in his dreams😂
Nice animation 0:01
Cool Terraria 3D Challenge
lmao i love ize hes so insane but in a good way.
The Arctic Town was the best looking and they came in last… somehow people don’t know what looks good.
7:43
Ize seems like a spoiled child, and honestly sounds to old to be acting like that
Skeppy Stole you're thumbnail
Yoooo squid kid from great battle of potatos bruh
I’ve done the math you had 105 players so yeah you didn’t lie about the 100 players
love the vid, had to check if my genshin was opened cause of the music ost you picked xD
Rip Star, Ize is the worst leader i’ve ever seen…. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIM!!!!!!
The worlds best potato farmer wait no the second best I am a squid kid
how do i get into these videos they look sooooo coool
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Src_4AlQ2Sc
More civilazation videos!
How can someone join a world like this????? I want too!!!
Okay so Jungle=Germany Desert=America Arctic=Canada
team jungle still are the winners for me, they fight against two teams
Funky the desite
Wow jungle is strongest
28:04 “Then they stormed the beaches of Normandy. ”
skyblock videos again plz
Squid helpt a nation bravo 👏 👏 👏  And the zombie should be the king no questions asked
Ize is like putin
The Jungle Leader used the element of surprise considerably well - however he lacked the competence to organise his people and instil discipline - many Jungle people strayed off and were killed alone. He needed to delegate and spread responsibility - not enough two-way communication. The impetus of his push on the Desert people dissipated rapidly with the lack of discipline, organisation and effective communication.   The Desert and Tundra people made one big mistake - their settlements lacked a perimeter - by this I mean no watchmen to catch incoming movements early - this gave them literally no time whatsoever to organise themselves and so they lost many to early routing.   The Tundra people could have repelled the initial Jungle assault even when they numbered only 10 by 'defeating in detail'. A famous tactic employed by Napoleon, concentrate your forces and engage a scattered enemy so that in every engagement you locally have the greater numbers. With good leadership this could have been done incredibly effectively.
I really like the music selection
Reminds me of Lord Of The Flies
Jungle because they put most effort to it
The dsert empire is basically the graveyard empire.
I’ve always wanted to compete with starkiller if I’m honest he’s such a good guy
Very nice experiment, I gotta say. Was rooting for the Jungle civilization but, it is what it is. Would love to join one of these one day.
If Starkiller was there it was sure they would win
Minecraft civilization mob version
Desert played well and were smart about how they went about defending, jungle and Arctic were both dumb, jungles king decided to attack like a paranoid dictator and Arctic's people for the most part weren't fighting back (which could have turned the tide of thst war alot sooner saving more of their people in hindsight)but all in all with them teaming up with the desert people it helped to show that a dictator ship isn't always the best and thst starkiller would have been a better leader after all.
That full diamond kid in the jungle biome was so annoying 😅
How do I jion
Bro when will u post again pls post videos
Can u make an "100 days as an endshapeshifter" pls
The Irish jungle leader was a straight up fascist lol
Why don't you upload more videos
It was like a fight for life and the desert people gave their all , arctic people's were just cowards running around and the jungle people were ruthless warrior that lived to slaughter people , if starkiller was the king ,jungle would be definatly be the winner
16:11 “Talking them up like your Jim Jones” literally made me burst out laughing so fucking funny
The Genshin Impact music works surprisingly well with this.
Probobly the best civilization video ever
“Sounds easy enough” *dies instantly*
Dude its crazy that its been a year you are already on a millions subs! Ive been here since 1k subs and im glad you made it :D
This is so coooooool do more videos like that!!!!! pleassssssse
0:54 mario music from mario bros world 5 jungle theme xd
Well I think its safe to say that, for the desert nation, legends never die
I really love it
Your voice alone made me like the video For some reason i love it
w vid
soup smart asl
the story of the jungle and the fight for power couldve been made into an anime
Hey man I got a question
Bruh squidkid.
This game mode sucks , u spawn 1 time only and killed for no reason , i will never participate in that shit
Didn't really liked ize but he gained my respect when he came back to his main island. I really thought he's gonna kill all the people who doesn't want to go but instead he came back with 10 of them, sadly it was lead by their fear towards their own king. Pretty good villain if I say so
man the jungle warmonger guy was super unlikable and annoying
my fav civil was jungle
30:44 xd
i really enjoyed watching this vid
i liked ize but when he got his head in his ass and threatened to kill unless they obeyed was a horrible choice, that shows from the soldier that wanted to join forces with someone else saying he hated his leader
Sorry I am late to comment but I hope your ok silver because u haven’t uploaded in 1 month and 2 weeks really hope things have been ok
what the heck happen to you silver did you stop youtube
I would have voted desert
They should make a state and everyone care a boat them then they should make a stronghold
I love the mario background music
The jungle's town centre is the worst looking one by far though
Artic for live😢
wow man i really like this civilization thing really really good job , this is the first video i saw from u rn but i dropped a sub and a like <3
Why arctic is not called Lapland? Cuz Lapland is in the arctic circle!
The north Korea guy looks like takeo lol
We need part 2 of this
35:50 gosh
My favorite team is the jungle one
ize definitely made this video more interesting
and he threw his netherite sword haha
The Mario music tho
me basa jawa
This is the Minecraft hunger games
Next Magma,Obsidian,Tnt
Jungles King is actually the best king out of all of them he had a point with starkiller and I was kinda sad he died
I just felt bad watching a nation loose people tbh
First I liked jungle but now I like desert
Dislike because you rooted for the jungle. Happiness is jungle king getting bodied
I love how the zombie continued to serve his nation even in death
Ize isn’t really a good guy I mean he killed star even after he accepted the results forced people to attack artic.
The ravenger thing was really scummy…
ᴊᴜɴɢʟᴇ ᴏɴ ғɪʀᴇ
This was a good video and was wondering if you could make another minecraft civilisation video, only with more biomes, a few more classes and a larger player count. Just to see what would happen.
the jungle king deserves to die
The Zombie was the real MVP
I don't know, but without Ize, this sequel isn't gonna be this intense. He's the antogonist that every movie needs. This is just epic.
Shoutout to Kashino55
I really wish we could see this experiment played out with 150 players
Infront of anyone, anyone, I can say that, I have watched YouTube videos for more than 8 years, and atleast 3000 minecraft videos. This is the video that I would even sacrifice my life to.   LOVE THIS VIDOE
I love your sound😀
the best video 🔥😂❤️
Could you consider do this with modded like industrialcraft adding resource dependance(oil) for production of commodities and wars for that xD
Genshin impact though 🤮
ad potato the 1st potato farmer  was my dad
Make another part plz
Man, so satisfying to see the jungle king get killed!!!
@Silver how do you make those custom terrains? i would like to do them too!
It also irritates me that the king role only helped in PvP, making the king, Ize, be picked because of how strong he was, not on traits of a good leader
Ize was wrong, if they would have stayed in the jungle and be more defensive, they would hsve higher probability of winning, they were basically vietnam and could have used it to their advantage
I was whit the jungle plus the zombie was not fair IT was invincible
Jungle rules
Everybody is talking about the video but I’m talking about his voice😭💀💀
Lol
Love your videos and your content
If Ize was a bit more humble and didnt let his cocky and armor take over his pride he would have wok
Kinda glad the jungle lost, I was rooting for them at the beginning but I hated their leader lol hes good but way overly cocky for his own good.
More pls
mấy người hay quá lên diễn đi
you should have an all star ep where the members of all the winning civilizations are in 1 map and see what happens
lei
I started the video and I saw xNestorio
Man that shit was good. The first few sentences that came out of ices mouth I knew that man was a sociopath.
Literally, My Fav. Civilitation was the desert for the characters: The Desert Zombie  and the one and brought the zombie. I don't need to explain why due to if you watched so far, the zombie was key for the desert civilitation.
My Minecraft username is syon7088 can I be in your neck is 100 Danes in Minecraft video with 100 players

Dessert
16:20 “I know but you’ve been sitting here talking them up like Jim Jones for 40 minutes” lolololol yesssss
I will sub if you do more projects like this :o i dont even play minecraft anymore but this was super nice !! Pls more
Wait in arctic is im_a_squid_kid     He had a war with techonblade with potatos in skyblock                    LOL
40:28 i think i've seen that somewhere...
Do more hypixel skyblock
Silver make a hardcore series from 1.18
Abstrekt's was in that husk
Damn ize was good at playing the villain
0:09 freaking xNestorio joined the game 😅😑
more
blood moon: exist  big brain people: haha better xp farm with better mob rates go brrr
How could you?! Geyshin impact?! Seriously
Jungle
Pls more
I liked the sus statue
I can say that I played minecraft for a long long time but I've never experienced the simulation. This map is incredible.
Artic: We have a fortress!  Jungle: We have superior equips!  Desert: GO ZOMBIE!!!!
Honestly, I hate and like I've. In the way I hate and like Umbridge. I like to hate him. He was the perfect villain for the story. But he can still take a diamond blade up his fer all I care
getting a promo from genshin is literally such a W lol
Ize reminds me of Floch Forster from Attack on Titan
I hated Ize how he handled people but because he make this content a masterpiece
i was rooting for arctic but was more than happy desert was able to avenge them
Also, has anyone seen Ize in other civilization videos besides this one? I assume the dude realized how hated he is and stepped away from the game type.
The zombie guy that almost killed the king of jungle is funny i laugh at the jungle king asking how is he zombie??
Do another video like this plss
My roadman
I literally prayed on Ize’s downfall the video and it was really satisfying to see him lose. As much as i hate him, i kind of see it as an actor playing a bad guy so well that you end up hating the actor aswell as the character!
i know its been a month but cmon, this video is so well edited! props to silver for this epic video.
Unpopular opinion: Ize had the best strategy he just didn’t quite execute it correctly. Everything he said about starkiller was the most likely outcome if star did become king. The jungle would of easily of won if they just had a more thought out plan rather than just ‘hit them while they are preparing’. ize was a good leader it’s just he had a more strict and aggressive approach than the others and if it was a more serious event I think he would of been a perfect leader. Like if the event was all competitive his mentality would be the most effective. Anyways this was a great vid 👌
im ur follower since u had just 4 videos posted :D
I like how jack says “yea dat sounds easy enough
I love how the Shrek guy says “oh Genshin impact hell yeah baby”
The desert was the best bc the jungle one just wants war not peace making them fail lol
ARTIC
How can I be on your wold with you
We want more like this one
Its already 1 month why u still not uploading silver
I love the fact that he said squid was the second best   TECHNO NEVER DIES
Its not on mac :')
dude the jungle people voted for a dictator who wants war
this was really good
Arctik
Genshine Impact : Anime Titties Thats it. Thats the entire game.
Somebody should have just Bombed every single area of the map with hacks
The jungle king is so annoying pls don’t feature him again he bullied his kingdom with quotes like “well I have the better gear so I’m better at the game” and “ I don’t know who died and made you king”
Earthbound music from out of nowhere, ftw!
The jungle king was a dick ngl
Ize really thought he could win with his "run headfirst into both factions back to back" strategy. He could've gotten a military strategizer but instead got Jungle destroyed when Desert actually starting defending.
suep really teamed with the guy who destroyed his entire nation such a traitor to the arctic name.
My friend is a big Genshin fan, so i downloaded it too :D
Nah the jungle kingdom was straight up rude, i was hoping the arctic was gonna win, their spirit was adorable.
No I loved the artict so much 😭✨
or just play nation glory
Are u dead?
I know Ize makes it more interesting or whatever but he’s just so obnoxious 😭 why does he have such a monumental stick up his ass over a game
Please make more series like this
Jungle is Green: Green is for  *Greed,* money, ambition, luck, glory and jealousy   Artic is blue: Blue is for: *Freedom,* imagination, inspiration, wisdom, trust, loyalty, and sadness.  Desert is yellow: Yellow is for *Hope,* friendship,  cheerfulness , cowardice and optimism
I'd wish i was there i would have been in the arctic and made a group of 5 players to make the arctic forces with 4 soldiers 1 miner and 1 farner and train the and make them very powerful to be the last defence of the arctic region
the snow civilisation❄☃
Shouldn't your channel name be Silvuhh. Cuz that's how you talk.
Are we NOT going to talk about that fucking voicceee 🤣
play skyblock
this reminds me of ww1 and ww2 ngl lol
Ngl Arctic had the best village build by far. No one can change my mind
KILLING THREE PEOPLE YOU CALL THAT CONTENT  Silver:of coarse
I love how they won WITH A FREAKING ZOMBIE
Thats ize guy tho
arctic was not giving chans of wining
its a very good video but his accent just made the video lame and anoying
Long ago all nations lived in harmony until the jungle nation attacked
Do another 100 shapeshift days
ize is a real one thats how u take control
Jungle
I feel like the Jungle Civilization King was a bit bossy, and a bit threating to the players. But, after all it was an amazing video! Keep up the amazing work!
I originally wanted jungle to win but itz is the absolute worst king they could have picked
artic= worst nation
Bruh ize was such a douchebag he only wanted to be the king and he didn't even try to make friends or sum. eventually that led to their demise. he was to confident in the end.
i hate ize because of his forceful attitude bruh
Irrespective of the economic crisis this is the best time to invest in crypto and gold, and I'm glad I'm making some profit
I liked the jungle most
This was amazing
I liked the jungle kingdom bcoz of Starkiller but with the other guy their defeat was inevitable
Ize was the best
part 2
When will you post the next video
i gotta admit,the jungle chose a fascist run
ayy my mans got that genshin battle music playing lol
I was rooting for jungle
Please make more civilization videos this is literally the most fun I have had with a Minecraft video ever😂
Jungle civilization is literally animal farm
And he's new
Silver theres another silver the channel is silverisme
The cow dispond when they all went to the deep dark in the jungle biome
You should definitely make more of these 👍. Keep up the great work 👍.
18 ads in a 40 minute video. This channel is garbage.
i love it
My man really pushed a creeper to save his mates. What a chad.
I can't get over that he was using to super Mario brothers soundtrack 🤣🤣 I used to be a huge fan of Mario so this was really funny for me 🤣🤣
26:00
Silver: Jump if you like Genshin Impact  That one guy: Oh Genshin Impact hell yes  Me: I wish I was there.
I vote for the Taiga Civilian
hot take: this video wouldnt be entertaining as much if it werent for ize, i legit rooted for jungle for its chaos' sake.
Ize was a dick but had a great strategy and managed to get people's trust. Imo they only should have planned things before rushing to desert. They could have win it.
Server Adress?
Ize is egotestic
Ize is very dislikable.
Yo this would be such a great series, maybe more civilizations? I think it would make for a better action if the civilizations had less people but more civilizations and maybe certain faction buffs and debuffs. Though as you mentioned this was all hard work and it was a lot of fun watching. Really loved it 😍
Ize is the personification of an inflated ego
I love jungle biomes but I think that Ize was a horrible learner that did only what he wanted. I started rooting for the Desert team. It’s amazing that they found a food source even in the desert! I think they deserve it
Is that donkey Kong music
I saw deserts cheated
Hahaha genshin impasct la always chasing me hahaha, bdw Nice vid
Great Video I'm using this in my school report on human activity
OWE0R PLEASE UPLOAD
bruh at 2:20 he did sqwid kid dirty
At least that traitor died, also I support ize
I saw silver break the tnt so desert could win
The second best patato farmer XD
i love how you used the genshin music throughout the video
Question if I could where could I download map
PLEASE do another of these, they’re SO GOOD!
Dictatorships never work
ew gi sucks
**SAO Opening Theme** "WELCOME TO MINE AND CRAFT!"
I wanted star to be the king
just to remember, genshin impact : 🤡🤓🤓
I hate jungle its dumb
At 31:39 there was 8 people remaining in the arctic and then a second later there’s now 13 remaining, HOW?
God that ending was literal poetry, and super brutal too. All of the anger they had for the Jungle nation, directed toward one unfortunate soul who was water tortured, stripped of their armor, and given to a ravenous zombie that viciously tore their flesh off as the Desert crowds cheered.  ...And then owned up to the previous foreshadowing when one of them randomly tried to bomb the throne after the king was elected by bombing the entire town hall at the end. The Desert nation were the true savages of this story, the Jungle nation were merely forced into conflict by a war-hungry leader.
Sure the jungle kingdoms strat worked...but MAAAN that guy was a total Dbag to the rest of his team, stealing stuff, demanding to kill them, like what a jerk.
Jungle nation had everything to win if they chose starkiller as their king
Theese sound tracks sounds familiar lol
Why does videos allways be like so long than movies
wow  69  *where sequal*
I realized that the song is from Genshin Impact battle song.
17:00
bruh I would just make my people just mine until thier freashed out
Jungles. Because the king is strong and also the jungle is strong
The jungle guy praising all the stuff then just this is the docks like who cares about  the docks
Arctic will be 1st place in my heart
:( I liked jungle
The conflict between Ize and Starkiller is just like that of Scar and Mustafa in The Lion King
The smartest always win in the end.
The jungle king is kinda mean
The jungle king or the netherite guy is sooo dumb dumb the guy dumb
hi pls like me
Jungle king thinks he’s in a Shakespeare book of Macbeth, being a tyrant and think he’s invincible
What is the goal? Is it jus to be the last civilization?

Use this as your I hate Ize button ( shit talking aint good but he honesly deserves it)

GENSHIT INFACT EWWWWWWWWWW
i was rooting for jungle tbh
Were there specific mods you used for the bot players like the natives and the temple guards and the events like the blood moon and hunger? Just wondering if it's free for the public to use.  I also love the video and I think you should do more of these because I really enjoy them :D
Literally stole MagicGum’s idea from the thumbnail to the intro
Jungle
The JG leader was a real badass tbh
5 civilizations pvp
Ize's ego was as stacked as his gear
I was on Suep’s side until 38:40 . He actually had a chance of winning but then decided to team with the main guy responsible for his people’s downfall
Jungle was the best
Silver, I was rooting for the Desert team at the start of day 1 because I live in a desert climate
BRO THE ZOMBIE FIGHTING THE JUNGLE KING IS THE BEST SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN LMAO
What happened to the 2 other players in Arctic ??

JUNGLE IS THE BEST!!
I rekon i would have been a good leader/strategist
L desert W jungle
Yoooo this is sick, ive never actually seen anyone do something like this. If you choose to do this more in the future i want in
Use this as a we dislike ives button
You know ives is just a bad person in real life.
tbh Ize was a egotistical asshole, yes he deserves the double hearts but not the "king" role and the crown. Star should get everything king related as he deseves it however Ize is an incredible warrior so he should be voted but the title and crown should belong to Star. However, if the abilities come with the crown, Ize can keep it but Star should still assume the "king" role. If Ize THAT good at the game then he can deal with iron, give the op armour to Star.
I saw xnestirio joined
i LOVE ARTICK
People of jungle civilization are super stupid
I love the genshin impact music in the background😂
0:53 🔥
my favert is artick
Never forget starkiller hats off to him who was assinated by a coward guy
wow i was rooting for the desert since the beginning and they won
I definitely want to watch more of these!
Is JackTBC the same Jack farmer that Starkiller said single handledly built their farm?
I was already rooting for desert
I like artic nation lol
Yooo that was lit
Easy this must be the best minecraft video I've ever seen, plot twists, overthrows, betrayals, revenge, and the ending was the best ever
Star killer was a boss. Ize was a leader
bro i wish i had java and a way to play in these just a amazing experience
Dessert for the win!!
I like the desert kingdom
bruh the jungle civilization is one who started the chaos with the attack on the iceland
Nooo starkiller
I liked the Arctic tribe best
Silver: "How'd that guy die?" Assassin: "Um..."
Ize was genuinely just an ass to everyone for no reason :/
JUNGLE IS DA BEST
PLEASEEEE MAKE A SEQUEL
ize wasnt the leader they wanted but it was the leader they needed4
Please make a part 2
Were they using a fair voting system?
This video was so good. I can’t stop thinking about it. I kinda want to rewatch it  It’s like a movie
People really hate Ize and I get it. He’s a true villain and I would hate him too if I was on the same team  But since he’s such a good villain, he makes the whole video all the more entertaining so that’s why I love him
I could literally just watch a rust tournament
Was glad to see that ize did not win
That was awesome, more content I don't care how many cows have to die!
this is the best video ever is like a movie
I really liked the Artic civilization and I would've immediately made an alliance with someone else to defeat Ize just to free the jungle's people.
U should keep doing these it's really entertaining!
I loved jungle
I like Jungle before they had a king.
Yes
I absolutely HATED jungle King. He is such a shithead. Other one would be way better.
i like jungle but they king suck
We all hate Ize but without him, the video would've probably went on for too long without any fighting/war
Why can’t players repopulate by mating
This was so hype
Dude, I absolutely love this vid. Definitely the best in terms of civilization videos, 110%.
Dang bro man really made a joke about technoblade being the best potato farmer
Omg this was so nice I am so subscribing to ur YouTube channel man I love ur content. This is the first time am watching ur content by the way n am in love with it
please make another Civilization video i like it so much
Imagine playing Genshin impact
Jungle
arctic
I wanted jungle to win but they didn't win:(
Greedy king -jungle Had the best generals -ice team Ruthless but wise king -desert team
Amouaaaa
I love the Arctic civilization it lost bcoz of a quick attack of jungle kingdom
Speak English next time please.
Nghe Phúc hát mà nước mắt rơi mãi ....quá nhiều cảm xúc ùa về, quá nhiều kỉ niệm. Cảm ơn Đức Phúc thật nhiều, giọng hát anh ấm tựa nắng mùa Thu vậy.
Interesting experiment that also showcases how wealth can make you feel I incredibly entitled. 🤔
Alternate plot twist: Pandas create a revolution against the Desert nation and form a united panda nation named "Panda Union"
Eh.... Artic was Targeted. Green was Favored. Judges were biased.
When’s next video?
Is it better to be a ruthless warmonger, abandoned or turned on by your own when fate arises, or... a kind and gentle soul who will lead fearlessly, who, even in death, can give the final order to set your people free.
Starkiller was the best of the best in the jungle, my man straight up didn't wanna be voted, and didn't want to have war (since he didnt even go to war until his death)... o7  I hated Ize, when he became leader and forced people to attack Arctic bro, I went mad, when he died I finally became one with peace. Edit: I swear the arctic's military general moto's is "Good soldiers, follow orders."
pls make another vid like this but add more nations, events, and roles I wouldn't mind watching this even if its 5hrs long
Wait. This thumbnail is AWFULLY similar to another video about the SAME thing..
this is so cool a wish i could join?
Wow i never knew we needed this kind of Minecraft content made me feel like i was a kid again
yo the ize arc was sorta epic tho
STARKILLER IS BETTER
5:50  This feels so energetic.
Ize is a great soldier I believe he honestly could’ve taken out the entire article civilization with the 10 people he originally started with. Star killer was great in organization of his community and understood the importance of each players ability. Not everyone was built to be a soldier that fact was proven when the players picked their classes in the beginning. Ize had ambition and big balls who knew how to seize an opportunity. Only to lead him to desperation asking for help from The Arctic general leaving him to die alone in a cave. StarKiller was charismatic with a honest heart that led to his betrayal dying alone in a cave. Star killer actually shared his loot while Ize would only share his loot after he would find something better.
RIP king Ize
While I wasn't paying attention to the video, I thought he said big chungus
I LOVE THE SPONSER GENSHIN IS BEST
I'm mad Starkiller didn't get elected.
What is wrong with your voice lol
One of the most fascinating Minecraft videos I’ve ever seen, I love the intersection of sociology and video games
I love the part where there singing 🥰14:30
Spread the Gospel
Spread the Gospel
Ize is a good leader
The Jungle and Arctic civilization was absolutely amazing. So dramatic, I found myself so invested!!! The story of the 3 refugees was awesome. Best 40 minutes of YouTube
The thumb nail should say " slaves and war " because of how many farmers there are
The wii Mario music 😫
REVENGE FOR THE FIRST JUNGLE KING
Silver is soooo cool
I hoped the jungle won
It would be cool to have a mmorpg Minecraft
L jungle
ZSPDKSC3V8V5
Lemme see another one of these pls
The music is so nostalgic
I was really hoping the arctic civilization would win. They had such a beautiful hometown...
Can we get more of these
What a journey! Great video!
Hey so can you go to your other channel
The second jungle king was pretty shit at leading.
In the jungle village it was litterally the embodyment of democracy against dictatorship
naa how didnt artic win the looks
Ize is the worst king ever why did people give him what he wanted
If Ize had made a deal with Star to be commander of the army Jungle sweeps
I liked the Artics... I was happy when they were among us... ;)
Funny how people take this shit so serious LMAO. "A true king must not seek war but always be ready for it" Like bruh this is a minecraft video stop being so cringe
I think jungle second leader was so bad  he always shouted to his team and was aggressive but the desert team leader was kind for his people don’t say I will kill you. jungle leader second was like Putin
Do you identify yourself as fat or obese? 9:03
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9 from the Bible ❤
I like the kaisserreich music of this video
Ize is the most toxic bastard ever.
I liek these things:D
Jungle was best SHOW NO MERCY ☠️💯💯💯
I was for real scared that the djungle boys whuld win
Jungle just went through the whole world history class
The jungle king was incredibly unlikeable, glad he got taken down.
it’s so strange how this video recreates the story of harold godwinson without even meaning to ?  basically harold godwinson was a powerful soldier who was named king (ize) after the former king died (star killer) , and then he caught wind of other armies coming to england so he went out of his way to ambush them first. he forced peasants with no fighting experience to join the army which lead to famine and the vikings in the north of england (in this case the arctic kingdom) . the duke of normandy then led his army to england and they just chilled out while they waited for the anglo saxons to come to them (the desert kingdom’s actions) and because of harold’s pompous attitudes and beliefs that he was the best warrior, he led his army to charge the normans who were already prepared, and he died :) the normans then took control of england .  what’s weird is that even the part where the jungle army came from over the mountain is similar to how the saxons attacked the normans from the top of the hill in the battle of hastings . it’s so cool how history repeats itself in subtle ways
Jungle
100,000AD 3,000
I don't know why I was rooting for Ize, i guess star was too cringe for me
We want moreeeeee
Bro whyyyy did ice just stand there RUN
even xnestorio joined the game XD
Bruhhh arctic never wins… no matter how much I rout for them
The jungle king is a bitch
I loved the artic civilization
Oh genhin impact hell ya baby
To be honest I’m kinda sad jungle didn’t win because desert did basically nothing than eat at their place while jungle was actually fighting the other people
Ize? Is that my brother?
I liked the jungle
This was fun to watch.
I like the jungle most.their king had that courage and leadership.. Please part 2 of this with same palyers and same king..
Your mean to arctic
How do people join this thing
Jungle leader was dumb as hell. He had a thriving CIV but then decided to waste it on a cheap ambush on a blood moon. He wouldn’t have lost so many if he would have waited till after blood moon. That would also give him time to build up morale and make his people comfortable with his leadership after there elected one was killed. That would also let his warriors prepare and train for the invasion.
nice editing
The YouTubers who joined are xNestorio painful technoblade preston
i liked the artic more
I hated Ize___. What a dictator. Star was such a good leader. Ize led the jungle civilization to destruction
I really liked the ice civilization 😭
Despite Ize being a ruthless and cocky leader, he made the video so entertaining by waging absolute warfare on the other nations, thanks buddy. I loved the warmongering Jungle nation, I wish they won...
Ize was Hitler
Jungle Civilization: Rich Agreculture Desert Civilization: Rich ore sources Snow Civilization: uh, snow
Let the content speak for itself. Don’t cry for subs or likes.
Why is this the best war documentary I've ever seen? 😂
wow man humanity really does suck
8:34 - You know you can see what's in a chest in Spectator Mode, right?
I watched from ilex’s view and am excited for the new video from yesterday’s events,
Ize is such a fucking tryhard, I'd feel bad for the Jungle Tribe but they passed up a good leader and got what was coming to them. Congratz Desert Tribe on a well earned victory.
jungle would win, if they wouldnt rush like this to the desert bruh
Please upload on Speed Silver again
This was so good ♥️ I loved it!
This was interesting, hope I see more of this civilisation thing
Spoiler alert                            I always knew the desert would win lol
You should make a civilization where when you die you turn into a zombie and then you can also be cured
I’m not gonna lie but who were the judges? Are they blind? The best village was the Arctic 🥶
This shit had lore in it
This was a good video but I hate how you gave the jungle first place for the loot like really I would have gone snow-desert-jungle but that's just my opinion
More like this
Would you care that I would be on mobile
The hell yeah baby guy is elite 😂
idk why everyone hates ize he was just telling the truth i hate the kid who went aganist him more then anyone else star was prob going to do worse did you hear how much he complimented everyone else he def was gonna become a dictator.
Rise of kindoms simulator
I like artick the most
Ize's parents must not have payed enough attention to him.
Genshin is the BEST game ever I think it deserves a chance to try it Fun fact: he used genshin music in the video... AS AN AR 50 PLAYER I SHOULD KNOW THAT.
I really wanted the arctic to live peacefully. Also can we talk about how the jungle had one of the most corrupt leaders out of any civilization in Minecraft ever
Hypixel skyblock when
Glad desert one tbh
we need more of this, this was super fun
This guy gets subscribers so quick
This was one of the best minecraft videos I've ever watched, great work this was so entertaining!
Ize = stalin
Even though a lot of people disliked Ize, I honestly liked him. In my opinion, a villain is needed to make stories more interesting. Seeing him cause tension between his tribe made me wanting to know what's going to happen next, as I believe if it was just peaceful, it would’ve made this video like all the other minecraft civilization videos I’ve watched. Also a good villain would need to have solid points for his causes and Ize did bring some solid points in the election about his pvp skills and gear. Even though he had to go through extreme measures to make the arctic invasion happen, it still was a huge success, almost annihilating their whole nation with only a few deaths on their side. Of course, the story must end with the heroes winning and I'm fine with the result as it was completely deserved. Even if ize may have been unbearable to play with, he still made this video a whole lot more interesting.
Bro yesterday you had 1.03M now you’re almost at 2M
I liked how the jokes in the desert kingdom ended up helping them in the invasion. Like the statue and the zombie.  Edit: And now that I notice it, it helped kill the key members of the jungle tribe. The statue killed the second in command general and the zombie helped kill the king and the last jungle player.
To be very honest, jungle would've won if the other guy didn't come around and starkiller was killed, the ruthlessness got jungle in its demise trusting too much in strength and gear. Starkiller had a plan. The other didn't
The jungle king is so so gready
I loved the jungle civilization
Epic vide
Super awesome 👌 👍 😍
imagine, inazuma battle music while muffled talking
Yes
40 minutes of my life so worth it lmao I dropped sub🔥
Nice vidieo✔✔

Watch funny video here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bphIPhLi4U&t=88s
IP PLS
Jungle team's king was kinda selfish. It was righteous of him to mine and get more resources but isn't this all about teamwork? Where was he when the first jungle leader built their civilization?  But yea i loved the video!! He made the thriller more interesting tbh
THE LEGENDARY ZOMBIE ABSTREKT
The zombie dude escaping and joining the fight fr made it feel like I was watching a movie
Dude you blew up since the last guy I saw u
this is such a good video, you should do another one. hopefully in the next civ video we'll see more infiltrations, spies and traitorships
Hey do you know this guy named speedsilver? I don’t think you and him have anything in common just asking.
I could picture how annoyed the damn full diamond guy in the jungle would be lol! I bet he was thinking: Oh would you just shut up mate!
I would love to see this as a sociology research topic on how groups of people interact in high risk society.
I loved the icy Artic kingdom but they lost😥😫  We want more We want more
the various accents make this increasingly more immersive
Remember when this was supposed to be his second account?
I liked the Jungle the most.
Awesome video
That was so nice
this guy straight up stole magic gums thumbnail
JUNGLE KING sucked. He was an awful king, and just so mean to his people. I was rooting for everyone but jungle under Ize rule.   Also, why were the bad guys natives?... :/
The arctic civilization: 💪
People who like Genshin: 🤓
It’s one of the best and most interesting vidéo of all youtube
Star killer deserved better
All hail lord Ize

I applaud for ize taking the role of tyrant king so we have villain
For me the desert is Really good on their tactics and Leadership
props to that guy who saved the other guy from the creeper
pog desert
This is world war 3
i was playing genshin while watching this vid and i got scared when there was genshin music playing lmao
I love that it has liyue BGM
all things considered i liked the arctic nation the best, they seemed like they had the best internal politics not to mention 3 bases, if they'd fortified the dwarven fortress they genuinely had a good chance at winning
Fuck ya genahin impact
Ize was THE MOST ANNOYING PERSON IN THE WHOLE VIDEO
The jungle leader have a good leadership its just the members are coward
Jungle was the best
The way he said "Yae Miko" was kinda funny
I would build bunkers every where 🌚🌚
bro i want to be part of this kind of video but i only have demo mincraft
I would play Genshin impact but my brother will like bully me for playing an anime game
4:59 that man's a hero, he saved that innocent bystander's life
I have to hand it to the jungle king. He had the gear, he had the skill, but he let his power and his ego get to his head and he underestimated the desert kingdom. Funnily enough the desert kingdom did exactly what the jungle king said Starkiller would do and just "sit around on an island eating carrots while the other kingdoms with better gear charge them" and they won
such a big potential except you griefed it
I liked jungle
Oh man and I thought the djungle region would get last place for the townbuild
hey, can u add the plugin off the ranks to the comments
Ize was the best leader
Arctic was a vibe
Rip arctic
jungle was like germany in ww2 xD
Jungle is my fave
The Owner of the jungle is like Adolf Hitler...
why did this make me mad-
i like desert, i hate geshin impact
Every minute hidden Genshin Impact ad...
Can we just talk about the fact that he used Super Mario WII music?!🔥
jooo i love these videos please do anther but in a snow desert and jungle world :)
Ize was the spitting image of Napoleon
so all these contestants are 40 y/o weeb discord mod neckbeard Lester's cuz they like Genshin Impact
I want jungle to win.
How dare you mistake squid boy for #1 potato farmer
i subscribed i luv ur content
I really liked jungle team , rip
Truly hated that Jungle guy so much
I like the jungle at first but when ize become the king I hate jungle and love desert
I like the desert kingdom the most
"second best"
This is an amazing video...
I was routing for the Jungle Civilisation.
Im 13 🥲
i love silvers accent
Hubert czy to ty???
It should have been stars :(
I liked jungle
Like
ize is the hitler of 2022
Wait, where did the zombie guy even came from
I never like the attitude of jungle king, he is full of himself. Thats what you get when u r dictator
The desert civilisation had very good defense ngl they got past a tough jungle who was attacking them
Yay I was going for the desert less gooooo
This is good
You should do this but with mods  Similar to RLCraft   Everyone has 2 Lives, 1 freebie and 1  real life  Sea serpents, dragons and more is a real challenging environment, not to speak about the other players!
I loved this video 😁
I personally think the christhmas civilisation was the best
I like the desert
Imo the jungle civilization wouldn’t be dead so soon if it wasn’t for starkiller getting killed.
I feel bad for anyone under Ize's boot heel, hope the players dont have any lasting problems from it (I've met so many people like Ize, logic and reason arent possible with them)
I was routing for the jungle the whole time!😭🙂🥲
This is just like those strategy videogames where there's 3 nations where 2 of them are chilling and one decides to rule all with military might (i.e. Fire Emblem: 3 Houses, Triangle strategy and avatar the last Airbender)
Lolol on other note! This video was so well done. Ive never seen a video like it, i am completely obsessed and want to watch even more. Thanks for all the work and effort that was put into this!! I hope all of you feel satisfied!! ❤️
I find it funny that Ize kept milking in the fact that starkiller would have had the kingdom back sitting still, eating carrots. But that’s exactly what could have given them an advantage. This is a 3 faction world and whoever the first two is to fight gives the third a higher advantage. It was painfully obvious that everyone needed better gear since there was a lot of resources being withheld.
The way Ize literally forced his own kingdom to fight or to be faced with death was gross. Thats extremely poor leadership if you can even begin to call it that. As well as silencing them when they brought up starkiller who was murdered?? A whole disgusting dictatorship. Yikes
I was cheering for the desert kingdom
THE ARTIC HAD THE BEST STRUCTURES
His feels like a documentary about war and survival of 3 nations
I have been in military study classes and we look at different types of leaders as well as how to use their strenghts and weaknesses to your advantage. They were all decent leaders only because the worst leader is one who doesn’t make decisions. Jungle King was good at pvp and had gear but his ego was a major weakness. Desert King had the peoples support and was fairly geared but he had a geographical disadvantage. Arctic King was good at using and rally what they had but in the end his nation was weak. Overall I think all the kings worked with what they had and at least they did something. I personally was not a big fan of Ize, thought he was too egotistical and just in general was too full of himself to be a good king. It did not seem like he cared about his kingdom, just the power that ruling gave him. But that is my thoughts
The smart move would be wait let the other nations attack each other and then go clean up the remaining
I loved star, but after the betrayal at jungle I rooted for desert
This was your best video yet. Do again. You earned by sub and like
Rest in piece Schnuffles, we loved you!
Bro when Chungledor said his thank you speech I died💀💀💀
Bro this is the coolest thing ever. like I’m a whole 24 year old man geeking out over how cool this would’ve been to be a part of🤌🤌great content
I respect how he called squid kid the 2nd best potato farmer, we all know it is Technoblade
quá xàm
The artic ones were the best.
They is not your video it’s Magicgum’s video you copied his thumbnail just slightly different
Man i hate desertteam
Would be better if the jungle had won

the jungle kingdom represented power, the arctic kingdom represented peace, and the desert kingdom represented strategy/intelligence. as you can guess, jungle beats arctic, desert beats jungle, and arctic beats desert (not really)..
how is arctic last :( in town building
jungle was so close ;o;
Is this map public, if so where could I find it?
Seek not war. But be ready for it.
The artic army was so busy running away they forgot to kill people.
the aritc
This was surprisingly interesting..  awesome video! 😁👌
The jungle king is a really bad actor, at least everyone else made it semi convincing it wasn’t rigged
I rooted for Arctic or Dessert, I hated Jungle the moment that warmonger came up. He was like the Minecraft version of Hitler.
Ize is literally a dictator
Bro jungle was into political Manhwa lmaoooo
I was first rooting for the jungle kingdom, but after they assassinated starkiller i was just rooting for their destruction
I'm happy ize also known as privatefearless before came back to yt, I missed him a lot and been watching his vids before with graser and kiingtong, it's fun seeing him back on yt again
MAKE MOOOOOOORRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEE I LOVE YOUR VIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have never been more invested in a story lol 😂
i liked a lot jungle kingdom
Ize stars a wimp  Final battle Quick we can hide in the cave system
I LOVED THIS I HOPE THERE WILL BE MORE😭😭😭
The leader of the jungle kingdom sounds like Conor Mcgregor 😂
booooooo
whats the IP?
Man in the end, even in a simulation, unity still win while Jungle is breaking up and lose
Ize EZ
we want part 2 pleassssssssssssssssssssss
thanks for mading this video this is what i need
I like to join them hehehe
I dont like that guy… you know who im talking about.
5:07 can we appreciate what this guy did he sacrifice his life to save that player😟
25:43  Invasion of poland
Something no on noticed the background song is one of the songs from  genshin impact
Not I’m a squid kid just building a little hut for the Arctic region 8:21
Dang it! i wanted the jungle to win.
The fact that he uses the sound track in genshin impact when u incounter an enemy in inazuma
Fire
play skyblock again or give me your stuff lol
Can I join one of those?
Just why I was rooting for jungle
Why
I’m kind of mad I really wanted the guy with the green voice to win
when you gonna play skyblock again, nether update hype
Finally something I want to watch
ok yeah
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish the Arctic won and that Suid Kid was King and survived
I've viewed your paetron and the Shapeshifter mod is really unorginazised I had to spend 30 minutes to set it up correctfully.
Yes I need more of this
Ize deserved to die
9:00 go take a shower
I am so sad that that jungle civilization lost. ize was so mean but he was powerful too😔
My favorit civilisation was the Arctic
Jungle was cool when star existed, he was very passionate about this and was a true leader. However Ize needs credit as well, he used deception and smart words to rise to power, but for some reason this whole thing with the jungle reminded me of Orwell’s animal farm, who knows will relate
I support jungle
Arctic: Peaceful but weak Jungle: Rich but chaotic Desert: Naive but organized
Why does ize think he’s some badman? He’s just cringe af
Ogreball or idk dont remember his nick he probaly is shit he killed  his own team
I like the artic civilization. They were calm till the end build awesome building including the among us crewmate ❤️❤️
I hate jungle team boooo they mean
My Dune..
Honestly? Ize was pretty freaking good, and would make for a good dictator: not kind, just good. I kinda get Solev vibes but even more skilled
Error
THE FACTT THAT HE HAS SEEN THE POTATO WAR
00:52 Mario Wii Jungle music
Ize was pretty selfish and he was a bad leader almost like he was a dictator
5:00 he saved their life🅿️
Morrrree
Gives 60 primos  Me: bruh I can get it from commissions  *still takes it *
Squid kidddd yeahhhhh
The best thing to want to do when you want to make a decisive ambush and be successful is unity thats why the King in the Jungle kingdom had to be the guy that had leadership...one person having increased stats is not worth it there was immediate chaos when be became king and the kingdom literally split in half
Jungle was best
LETS GO I WAS WITH THE DEREST NATION and the zombie was the strongest
Its been a long time when i saw You My friend silver😢
Arctic nation building among us statue to demonstrate the sus of their nation: Ending up as actualy traitors in the fight of desert vs jungle
I've never really been into Minecraft content for 7 years when I was 7 years old what are the daggers xd   Are they some mode or texture pact or are they a real weapon added to Minecraft?  Did they also add voice chat?
If I was a jungle guy, even if I had a wooden sword and leather armour I would still try to kill Ize. He is a betrayer
You talk funny
Im waiting for new viedo so loooooooooooooong
My name is actually silver and Nino
2:18
This is better than most Netflix series.
i wanna be a part of something like this. if only minecrafty would work on my computer.
The Arctic kingdom was a peaceful one and my favorite, I was definitely rooting for them.  The desert kingdom was prosperous, and had a lot of advantages.  The jungle kingdom was a ruthless conquering empire, I kind of hoped that they were attacked by hoards of creepers and endermen and skeletons and just died.  If the Arctic had been more organized, or had a pre thought out plan for a surprise invasion, then they might have survived.
Please work on part 2 in this . This is very enjoyable
100 youtubers copy a successful video idea
Best 40 minutes of my life
bruh i cant downoald it becuase idk and  i liked the desert civalization
Jungle Civilization basically experienced Animal Farm
I hate the jungle leader.
I like the Arctic... they are cheerful and happy .
Very subtle sponsorship lmao
Did they really plant a TNT beside desert king Throne ?😂😂😂😂😂😂
Squid kid technoblade can do better
The artic was my favorite, and Jungle was my least.    HAVE YOU EVER HEARD IF GENSHIN IMPRACT???
The genshin battle music in the background LFMAO
SECOND BEST POTATO FARMER HA
This is quality, such a good video. So glad that jungle king didn’t win 😂 was kinda hoping ice soup guy could pull back a win. If ice people attacked more instead of running they would of got a few more kills on jungle. Creds to dessert.
5:00 that selfless sacrifice to save the other player can not go unnoticed
more of these?
If i was ize i will literally just vote starkiller as the king cause like ize was charging and was not prepared for their upcoming raid for the desert nation while starkiller has a strong leadership and they would be prepared if starkiller was the king
Lesson on being cocky and full of yourself
I feel bad for squid but at least Techno took first
The Jungle Leader made me soo angry myself. He was so focused over having power instead of finding out what was best for his people. If he truly wanted to be king, he would have listened and tried his best to strategize with his team. Maybe even having more sympathy with Star. But he was so rude and selfish the whole time, that his overabundance of confidence just brought him into misery. If I were leader myself.. I would have tried to provide for my team, so that the 'weak' players of my team wouldn't die. It was kinda dumb how the Jungle king kinda just.. didn't share at all. He was so rude to his people, tbh, idk how they would be able to worship him. I was even offended.
Yees i love the desert biome great video
Arctic kingdom is so wholesome, too bad they don't have a good army..
So wait... The jungle people elected an angry guy that focused heavily on war industry while everyone else was busy getting better as a civilisation He attacked an unsuspecting neighbor and took them out as fast as they could Continued doing the same and in the end lost to the guys who live in a cold climate that had the numbers' advantage  Hmm...
Rip my bestie Schnuff ❤️ she did so well lololol
the king of jungle was so bad
i wanted the Jungle civilaization to win
9:08 "oh genshin impact hell yeah baby" i like this part XD
WOW! i was entertained like watching an adventure survival movie. Part 2?
Glory to the peaceful nations
Lijkt net op The Kingdom
electing a king hmm i dont think king means what you think it means xD
genshin impact sponsor, shame on you!
It should be called the noble tier not the king tier but ok
But they had sixteen people when the desert had 25 not fair
Jungle was so good
Artic sad
Poor squid kid 😂😂😂
Woah jungle kingdom is to powerfull
It was kinda unfair when dessert and arctic teamed up against jungle but anyways GREAT VIDEO!
Nice you used Genshin impact music in your video lol
I didnt play Minecraft but like this auto subscribe
Will u release the mod
I liked the jungle
My fav civilization must be the de--  Zombie warrior, not only did he have the speed and strength to back himself up. He also took the jungle king by surprise and lead the desert people to their victory. He even has netherite armor gifted to him by his people. truly a zombie worth my respect
Video idea: have 5 different teams to vote what country they should be and have them close but not too close there should also there should roles: leader/president soldier/warrior and a farmer, co president/ co Leader, Gun builder/engineer. The countrys can make an alliance with other countrys if a war breaks out. which better country gets guns or swords with armor for the soldiers and farmers get a lot of food to help there people the co President and president gets netherite armor, Gun builders/engineer gets recipes to build sentrys or guns, swords to build. the ok country gets the same loot but co leader and leader get diamond armor. engineers gets same thing but only can craft guns, swords. farmers get only 32 food for there people. the country who's the worst get terrible stuff co leader and leader get iron armor. engineers can only make swords farmers get 4 stacks of 16 for there people to eat. and if one of the country invades or try to attack they will start a war. who wins the war is granted the name of greatest minectaft country. i planned do this idea but im not big and not to many people and i don't know how to make a server to do this so yeah but heres my video idea hope it will be in your youtube video.
Jungle is the best
Isn’t this a direct copy from a Wilbur Doot video?
Rise of kingdoms I minecraft lol
Why do the civilization i like always die first😔
If u see in the intro during which the where he explains everything, there is a brief period where it says xNestorio joins. Is this true, silver?
Wow. Just wow. The betrayals, the chaos. Reminds me of my good times playing Fight Cube on French servers (a PVP capture the flag game popularized by some French youtubers)
To hell with ize
Hi silver
Sounds like the jungle king was using Democracy.
This is a copy of magic gunms video
JUNGLE FOREVER
Need more!
Artick baby
3:48
Definitely want a sequel. I absolutely love these civilizations videos
How do I get to be in one of these things
Pls do more of these
why no queen only guys no girls 😡 only guys got chosen and you said king nothing about queens 😠
when will you do skyblock again
i definitely liked the desert empire the most. Best houses, best zombie fighter, and best ideas and they are so chill
Dwarf mine?
BEST YOUTUBER
this video is so good man
Lol genshin impact is losing popularity so now they are doing sponsors lol lol
I want this with religion
sad that the jungle kingdom lost
If you look closely the desert civilization is increasing in population during the final battle, can anyone explain why?
just say if you kill me you@re gay
I just felt bad for star killer
This is so fun to watch! Imo, star deserve to be the king more. He’s like a guy who would made alliance and do fair 1v1 at the end. Ize sucks man I hate him even tho I’m the audience still
Jungle nation would've won if they hadnt fought
The music used in ur videos are from Genshin Impact, and I find that a bit funny
The izi is so cringe I canttt
Bro really stole magic gums thumbnail
Man If this was in my history textbook then I'd get an A grade. Interesting than russian revolution.
What is the server adress?
wow this is soo cool
This video you make is Soo nice i love it bro
Technoblade should be there
Honestly the Jungle Kingdom couldve easily won if Ize didnt become King theres 3 civilisation if you invade one theres only 2 outcome your invasion was not succesful and you lost mens second outcome is what happen in the video your invasion was succesful but the remaining artic players team up with desert.
Where is Skyblock video 😐
Yoooooo the zombie ending!!!
That was awesome
Pls can you make this again
Pary 2
I didn't expect the genshin impact Lmao💀
Jungle and desert
Im so happy
Desert never lose but where the 5 arctic people they die or they survive
“Ah man this guy waffin” LMAO
Dude the arctic is slayed but the desert like giving them a hand
yall should tell silver to play hypixel skyblock
No one gonna talk about how that one guy sacrificed himself to the creeper?
can we pls have another one
xNestorio?  hmn
I hated the jungle, then like them again. Kind of sad they didn't win.
You did squid dirty
Suggestion: Make another video like this, but when people die, there is some kind of system to judge how "good" and how much "good" they did (e.g., kills, things mined, things given away to others, etc.) and they are then judged against the people already dead and sent to either a heaven or hell kingdom
The background Gen shin music really adds to the video
Pronounced Tuh-VOT not TAY-VAT
I love the zombie teammate Lol
WE NEED ANOTHER!!!
ainz or whatever generally annoyed me so much throughout this video got me sitting here irritated
TEAM DESERT “ its high noon”
Ize was the literal dictator in this
I like ice kingdom and Desert kingdom
Imagine being the first person to die...
This video is beautiful it is so realistic
Bruh the artic one was the best
Ize's strategy almost worked, but he's the kind of person i wouldn't even talk to, even less play with. Also in a three factions game, the first two to fight give a big advantage to the third.
Ngl I loved the jungle until he became king it’s giving fire nation vibes and I hate him and his subordinates who agreed😒
I liked the desert civilization
The Desert biome I liked the mostv
Jungle king was weak afff
That one Jungle guy that tried to be loyal to Star even after his death just to get slapped by some refugees
Timestamp for myself 26:00
Silver can you get me 100k Sub I will be thankful to you please 🥺🙏
Just giving an excuse to myself, as I normally don't watch "videogames videos", but if I'm going to spend my time watching a videogame, then this is the kind of videos that I want to watch.  For me, I see them like "Social Experiments", in these videos, I see people from the 21 century, fighting, arguing, planning against the "chosen one" of the other teams, getting trades, I see psychology, and how people are influenced so easily, men, I love this shit...
Dessert is the goat
This is by far the worst version of "simulating society in Minecraft" I've personally seen
Ize got what was coming
i was here since 200k keep it up, i have my og ticket w me ;))
WHATS WITH ALL THE MARIO SONGS
genshin sucks
The jungle king was to rude Yeeessssss desert you help attics 🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
We want another civilization video, I do to
I just hate jungle king
I was so happy when Ize died, he was just betraying anyone, governing with fear and didn't consider his people, he was the worst leader. I just hoped that the jungle group was plotting to assassinate him when he returned lonely before the artic war, it was teh perferct time
I need so much get there in next time XDDD
27:40 Putin refrence
I hear genshin battle music in the backround...
Genshin fans will all smile when people sponser genshin
5:00 respect for inevitability. He sacrificed himself to protect his teammate(Voxet_).
MOREWW
If ize was less toxic and egotistic he would’ve been a good king but he was annoying starkiller was cheering everyone up like a true king
H7S SOUND LOL HIS SOUND IS LIKE AN ANIMAL XDD
The sequel is forest civilization
Damn its a shame the jungle dictator wasn't struck down by mass vote or divine intervention. It was such a bright future snuffed out.  Edit: So glad he died in the dirt.
That ize guy should probably come out of his basement and stop pretending to be Hitler.
The jungle team shows how the corruption takes over the world.So yeah nice movie for me
arctic should've won
Pls do more of these
Idk I kinda feel like this video sucked cause of the jungle king isn't even his attitude all though if that's how he acts in person he would for sure deserve to get rocked but idk I was expecting something different it just felt I watched a Minecraft virgin run around killing people which is literally just any other game of Minecraft online battle mode lol idk I was expecting them maybe to join forces start a trade maybe start a war from something in that nature other than any idiot running around with a sword
“Led by the best potato farmer in- wait no i read that wrong. SECOND best potato farmer in minecraft, im_a_squid_kid.” This shouldve been followed with “, not Technoblade.”
Respect to the 5:00 guy who gave his life to safeguard his friends from the intruder.
Talk about lag
The quality of the editing in this video is pristine, good job.
I liked the desert most
I mean some of the juble players were just idiots like the dude who tried to join the other team
First video I have every seen from your channel and I’m actually sick with the stomach flu  and I am feeling better
ize is such a arrogant person
See, Ize was an ideal warmonger. But he needed to plan out his attacks more than just "they're probably still gathering stuff so we need to attack now." That was a good plan of attack but he didn't account for stronger enemies with more gear than the usual's like the desert had. Also his army didn't believe in him for too long, leading to wavering loyalty and dedication which slipped up the momentum of his attack force
you need to post again!
please more!!!
34:50 That miserable traitor got what he deserved...
Aw, I wanted Jungle to win. I like how pragmatic and ruthless their king was.
I subscribed
Are you copying MagicGum?
people don't understand true aristocracy
For some reason whats hapening in the jungle civilization reminds me very much of the plot of the lord of the flies
NOT THE AMONG US STATUE 💀💀
Im surprised that jungle civ didnt think of electing TWO RULERS, it would be the best outcome diplomatically. Like clearly one is better leader and other is better at the game and needs this upgrade so they should elect Ize as military leader (and only military, so he can have the crown for stats) but true leader would be the one everyone wanted and that one would decide about things other than warfare, like keep everyone morale and cool.
um no 💀
Arctic deserved second, the dessert already had all they need
Those guys who wanted the jungle throne are kinda stupid
I love the music because it’s from the sponsor Genshin impact
More minecraft civilisation
Do you have a link to the world
I there a seed because I want to play in that region
The fact techno didn’t comment about squid kid makes me so incredibly sad.
Mines the jungle
The Jungle Civilization felt like it was *BOUND* to lose.  Star's case:  - charismatic  - helped the Jungle Civilization  - Not very geared  - Gullible   Ize's case:  - A killing machine  - geared up  - Put his ego first  - Didn't think of what his actions would effect the outcome of his game, seriously you killed the arctic civilization and expect the last person of the civilization to do any good..?  Anyways, neither of it would be a good battle for the Jungle Civilization.
I really expected Squid Kid to be the arctic king bc of all he did in the beginning
full diamond is a nerd
Mf learn how to speak Also good video
These are the best minecraft videos, they are the only ones I watch, oh I also like to watch those players hunts other player, those are cool too. Make more of this.
Does anyone have big floyed in fortnite
this has some hitler vibes
please upload this same with different mods again
Please make more videos like this one, it was super entertaining
If the jungle tried to team with the arctic they could have attacked the desert then could of backstabbed the arctic. They could do this since people knew the jungle was the most powerful because they got 1st place and the arctic were the weakest.
i like this good job
mans holding his nose while talking
How do you talk in-game??? What client
Best comeback story I've seen in a while
but you missed the part where they breed, its also important for population maintaining
Ize sounds Irish therefore he cannot be the leader of the fascist civilization he was trying to start
Ize ignored a possibile compromise, he becomes king in name only, he was correct that as the best geared and a warrior class the extra hearts benefits him more, so he could have made a deal with starkiller: ize gets the crown for those hearts but in practice starkiller leads the nation and ize leads the military. nations irl do this where the king is the ultimate general but theres a council of nobles or a prime minister who leads the nation itself
Yooo this was so cool I would love to participate in another tipe of this videos
I want to play this so bad, it would be so fun with friends
Yo 100% part 2
Ngl the jungle rebels destroyed their Nation
junle on top ize is a king
Jungle civilization
The jungle king was such a tyrant he deserved his fate
Star should of been king
That jungle civilization is lit
This was some good content
are you sayyoor
I dont like jungle buuuut i hate when sup kill the jungle guy who wants truce overall artic deserves the dab
honestly ish make the story better but silver is better at coding the event and custom stuff
Pls make cooler video it is 500 player fighting this will make a lot of fun  100 arctic 100 jungle 100 desert 100 mountains 100 island(many islands) It will make a lot of fun
Love it
I was rooting for ize rip
Funfact: the cow despawned
I think Ize was great unlike most people I liked his personality he added a lot to the server
I'm a minority but I really liked IZE, he led his faction to the end game and nearly bullied everyone in his way. There are things he could've done better but overall I think he was a better leader than star was, if not that, then more entertaining
Let's go Jungle King! lmao honestly he was the best choice for the job and nearly won IMO. He flexed his gear to get the crown, led the Jungle successfully to Arctic nation during a BLOOD MOON btw, ( Big BALL Move , managed to go back and rally the rest of the team successfully, many examples of a good leader like him or not. Great vid
Love it
21:30 LMFAOO
Did y'all see xNestoroi
Ize was only able to eliminate ice kingdom with the netherite that starkiller led to get, not to mention they would have gotten enchants with that same supply drop, ize did absolutely nothing but bully and lead the people to death
wow that technoblade potato war reference
Better lore than the dsmp.
hah that was insane! I cant believe the desert guys won, considering they were ambushed! The irish Jungle king was a great warrior, but ruthless and kinda douchy :D very game of thronish haha. Great video - i was enthralled.
although the jungle king was corrupt and a authoritarian dictator a simple thing as scouting and strategizing rather than assaulting like a hoard of barbarians would help them greatly.
Silver please bring back HYPIXEL skyblock it has been over a year
Whooooo sand kingdom
16:09
The moment *Starkiller* was overthrown, I knew the Jungle kingdom would fall. Notice how every domineering & untrustworthy leader crumbled
$16 a month for YT PREMIUM?! ARE U JOKING GOOGLE?!  Bruh, $2.99 a month gets me 200GB of data. Small donk energy 🤣
15:18 Zombie bro doesn’t like Genshin
Damn, the guy who took over the jungle was actually such a dick 😂
HOW WERE THE ARCTIC NOT 2ND?!?!!?!?
i clicked this random video not having any expectations, and then I heard the voice of FUCKING SPEEDSILVER THE UHC GOD I remember fondly watching your uhc highlights, great to see how well you're doing now that uhc is dead
Jungle village giving me strong prussia vibes
please make this a series with different biomes in the next one!!!!
Yall are making valid points 👉  However  Desert Necromancy ftw
Rip star
Bro jungle people are a holes by killing your only cow and stealing all the loot (day 3)
Ize played a great character in this video, he made it a lot more fun to watch.
please, part 2
I was going for jungle
your voice is my 13th reason
Desert first, Arctic second, Jungle should  be the last that got the ravager.
Genshin impact time!
Hi sliver I don’t have twitter and I’m not in America so I can’t play but I really want to be in these videos
INFERNALLY NOOOOOOO
Kingdom
I like desert
Bruh you stole someone's video thumbnail and script
Go desert
*he used an advenced technique called LIYING
? I dont get it you litterly have the exact same title premise and thumbnail as a recent video by MagicGum and you call it "inspired" bruh
I'm SO GLAD jungle didn't win.  I HATED their king.
6:39 LMAOOO I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE GENSHIN IMPACT BACKGROUND MUSIC. EEEER
I don't find ize more entertaining. I feel Starkiller could've lead the jungle to Victory.  Ize lost so many people just getting to the artic.  Sad days for the jungle they could've won.
Lmao even the undead desert member knew to fight for his team
I was rooting for Desert kindom since the start, they had a king who made wise decisions and an inspiring guy who rode the zombie comrade on a boat.
Ize got what he deserved 👏 😤
its been a month since u posted ur last vedio
Cool maybe I'll join if I have a pc
"who is making among us" 😂😂
I was so happy when Ize failed miserably. After Starkiller died 'mysteriously', I would've 100% joined another kingdom just to avoid hearing his voice. Even if I later died to Ize himself, I'd have no regrets.  (Also, who else was thinking of "Ides of March" after hearing his name and hoping someone would be Brutus?)
Jungle was way better. If the king was elected from the start, they might have won.
I know I’m late to comment but imagine getting roasted for your potato harvesting not even from Technoblade
The guy in the jungle with enchants: I didn’t contribute to Society at all but I’m rich so give me power.  Bad leader, relies on Im the leader to lead his people
2nd best potato farmer is an elite title.
Honestly if star killer was king the jungle kingdom might have been in a better situation
We need 300 day as a shapeshifter in minecraft
Bro ize seems like the kid in school that thinks everyone likes him and thinks he’s better then everyone when he’s not at all
I liked the arctic
glad to see the tundra not be the main expansionist power in this type of video
yeah second best technoblade is the best not squid kid
Before the video starts I think I vote for jungle or desert
tbh i thought jungle was gonna collapse in the begining like they were gonna have a civilwar
I am one of your biggest fan
Can i be in one of the civilization video
Potato man
lets go potato man
Definitely was rooting for anyone but the Jungle kingdom.
"And you killed none of them?" *zooms* "Gosh"
Damn come on jungle nation
35:00 deserting coward got what he deserved
the jungle king was the best
Why was I smiling the whole 40 minutes?
When i search for survival server this is what i mean
NAH IT'S THE WAY MY JAW DROPPED when Ize got pressed INSTANTLY after someone said "DON'T GO, DON'T GO, DON'T GO." Star might have been lying just to get on his team's side but at least he pretended to be nice. 🙃
I love how the jungle kingdom went full Animal Farm
That jungle story was Julius Caesar's story only Minecraft lol
I did a application
2:20 LMAO SQUID CAN'T RECOVER FROM THE POTATO WAR NOT EVEN IN OTHER PEOPLE'S VIDEO'S
Chúc anh luôn sức khỏe và hát cho chúng em nghe nhé
cant stand this voice bruh
Great vid. Loved it
I get if there was actual life changing rewards for Ize's tactics to be so strict but when you're doing it like this it just ruins the fun for other players and on a stream you end up just looking like a wet blanket
I really shouldn’t be this into it, but jungle king was way to brave, have t finished the video but I have a feeling that jungle is gonna make a mistake
I liked the desert
Lol star killer should’ve opened up a position for military general; would’ve survived 😂
That fucking dictator in  Jungle
Ize was such a bastard, so glad he lost in the end.
the king of the jungle reminds me of gegis khan
It’s always the guy that doesn’t know the meaning of leadership who gets the crown. Guess the people are gluttons for pain
29:32 Did anyone else see the irony in that.
9:07 ohhh genshin impact hell yea baby  XDDDD I'm dying
The 2nd best potato farmer I lived that moment BUT TECHNI IS NUMBER 1 AND SHALL ALWAYS BE
Such a great Idea. I want to be a part of the story if youre doing a part 2 (=
I rooted for Jungle because their king actually knew what he was doing and wasn't just sitting back and roleplaying like all the others. The one Jungle guy loyal to Star who probably knew him irl and wanted to betray getting killed by the Snow refugees was super satisfying. Too bad the Jungle king didn't strategize well enough for the final invasion and tell his subordinates not to stray too far from a group.
The jungle more like russia
Only users who never installed genshin impact can like this comment
this jungle king was a literally biggest clown there
Nerf miner
Z
Jungle is like the villain kingdom Arctic is the innocent kingdom Desert is the justice kingdom  Ize is also the most villainous character gere
Sue was op❤️
wish jungle won i thought they were good
yo i wannaa participate in a second vid of this this looked hella cool!
I was angry when I see the jungle king force the hiders to go to war
i liked arctic most beacause they had amogus.
Very nice story arc
Make 200 days but have An Allie
It sucks to be the desert civilisation because it would be hard to get food lol
Sequel
Please do this with the Lord of the Rings mod
Yo how'd they get in game chat?
I wished more kingdoms did battle strats like the jungle king even though he was a rough king.
Silver missed the opportunity of switching the thumbnail from the current one to "War and Peace."
The “civilization” word  Makes me feel similar to rise of kingdom game
the fact that suep betrayed the desert tribe in a heartbeat to save Ize
I have gi
I wanted artic to win, they seemed so chill
Ize is the most unlikable person easily
omg your right
love how suep just didnt give up
Your one of my favourite YouTubers I subscribed and clicked the notification buttun
Can you like not let the jungle king2nd in your videos again
This Ize guy can go fall in a ditch lol. Would never play with this dude.
star killer forever
ize was really unlikable, he didn't care about his people and only wanted to "win"
Genshin Impact is the new Raid Shadow Legends!!
I liked the jungle most They have all real world drama
Love it so cool
Ize must be a league player, such an inflated ego, and narcissistic and disrespectful approach to everything and everyone around him
I got a mith if you drow a ender pearl at a cow it well take damage.
Arctic civilisation was wholesome :)
Crazy
bro give star the same gear and boom like tf bro pisses me the fuck off and im at the king elction and i think they should kill him and take his crown
Ize the type of kid that does not get the good loot and then leaves the server complaining the whole time.
You did it best out of the people doing this style of video
Lâu lắm rồi mới được nghe lại bài này. Hay lắm ạ 😘
At 10 seconds tecnoblade joins
16:20
Ize  was a scumbag. The dude thought that he should be a leader when he was greedy. No one is going to elect you when you keep all the good crap for yourself.
Yooo wtf is infernally doing there
How does one get into these servers? I would love to take part in one lol
the jungler kid was just stupid a cokky
this is so sad, this literally showed that only edgy teens play minecraft xd
You can’t equally divide 100 by 3 tho so it’s not fair?
I haven’t even watched the video yet but I’m rooting for desert  LETS GO THEY WON I was starting to lose hope after the jungle team massacred the Arctic team
I liked arctic the most, they were really chill and had a really cool village
here is an idea use the blood moon to kill as many creepers as possible then find the enemy base you want to attack and bomb the shit out of it with artillery then have a full ground attack on the base
God I love that zombie.
More of this content please, this is so fun to watch tbh i rarely finish a video that is 30+ minutes long but this one
YES GENSHIN OM-
jungle was my fav
Pls make 1 more skyblock video I really miss your videos it doesn’t even have to be a good video just 1 more
If you think about it, Arctic is South Korea, Jungle is North Korea and Desert is Germany. Pov to the real world!
Ice = Nazz German,  ice = Europe,  desert = USA
28:17 The jungle leader really pulled a Napoleon into their Russia
I've always wanted to do this. With a fuck ton of players
abstrekt the coolest
Honestly by the time of the election, you could have easily figured out who was gonna win this. Jungle obviously was not, as despite their impressive military might they had a leader who was arrogant and selfish. Arctic might have had a chance if they had fought back, but even then they had a King who failed to take charge of the situation until it was too late and he was killed, and the one who took his place was too concerned with victory for his own kingdom that he ultimately caused his own doom. Desert was the only Kingdom that had true uniformity. They had an elected King who accepted the responsibility, had the kindness and tact to accept the Arctic refugees but also be wary of them, meaning their betrayal wouldn’t be as bad, and they had both the military strength to oppose the Jungle as well as the cunning to overwhelm their blitzkrieg style of combat. In the end, it was amazing how their dead teammate was the one who finished things off. Way to go undead warrior.
In conclusion, jungle leader ize is dumb and he just made the gameplay short
SO MANY ADS
Is that Mario music
The jungle one has the most story development
Plz one more videoooooo
tbh if that jungle guy didnt try betraying them they could of possibly won he was stacked on gear
i feel very bad for the guy who just wanted to join the desert team
I'm so glad jungle lost😅
I liked the video for the Genshin ad 😂lol xD
The genshin impact music is the best especially inazumas
Ize legit became an Eren Yeager
Jungle
Never seen even one of your videos until today, but damn that is some crazy good content. Wow. Instandly made me want to follow.
I like jungle region they are brave
The jungle king was really committed to roleplay as a tyrant
This was great shame not more teams
Nooo my favourite civilization is artic :( they seemed innocent and friendly unlike jungle who is ruthless and merciless
thte jungle leader literally lead his entire team to hell, ever since they did the full invasion. It was a bad idea. You couldve waited for the other teams or get ur team all the way up to diamond armor and then invade
so shocking, the bossy jungle king was also the clueless one!
U sponsor *GayShit Impack* ?!!😳😱😱
There was a guy named muddybladezs in this video. I recognized them immediately as one of my former soldiers under my command. Our director had chosen to kick them out and I could agree for the reason why. Muddy and a friend, someone_unique, decided to create a opposing group to the one I had founded. Clearly, it didn't work. out numbered 10-1. We raided their discord server and many didn't like muddy's partner. I decided I would end them by manipulating a staff member to giving me a 32k (sharpness) in order to kill them in a fake duel. No one knew I had use an illegal item until months later when a spy found me out. There was a lot to this story, but one more major one was that Muddy and their partner actually began doxxing people. They had been permanently banned off the server. I was saddened to see a good friend do such a thing and I had to shoot them down and kill them whenever it came to the fact whether or not other commanders or the director or assistant director was on to enforce our kos. Also, great content Silver! I wish I could be there :) Muddy, yes, the NRCI stands still for another day.
Xnestorio was in the war
Man I wish Seup didnt betray the desert. I believed in him :(
can i join pls make a part 2
My favorite is the guy who bring the zombie with boat all the way to their base😤
Ur voice sounds like when I make a silly voice
This should be a great movie 💖
Jungle invading artic is pretty much like Russia invading Ukraine
20:19 civilizations*
Best Minecraft content I’ve seen
Subscribed, expecting more videos like these soon...Crazy funny and entertaining!
Zombie Mvp
I was hoping a arctic lone survivor would clutch up
im starting somting like this realm code is 89Duf8876cc-7
Ngl I feel like the ravager was like, the most unnessecary thing ever
Ize should’ve been killed instead of Starkiller. Starkiller was actually a really good leader and all Ize wanted was to kill every last one of them. I bet jungle would we actually succeeded with good leadership
I was so rooting for jungle team can you bring back everyone for a rematch? the new experience from this video might be carried to a rematch version which equals great content
yoooooo that was insane
The saddest death is obviously the guy begging for his cow.
Kinda dumb decision from the jungle king to atack the desert. They could have prepared more loot
Abstract was a true patriot
I think this is why silver only post video like once a month because of his insane edits
I hated the jungle faction because of their stupid leader they lost
My sister has riden Shogun
PLS DO A SEQUEL
I think people like ize shouldn't appear in these videos. Not only was he toxic, he was also a bad roleplayer. He ignored his teammates while they were fighting hard to overcome the challenges that were proposed, and instead decided to hyper farm himself to get overgeared so he could just do whatever the fuck he wanted. I think these type of guys ruin the whole purpose of these videos.
This was such a cool and engaging story to follow, I was surprised how fun it was!
Jungle is absolutely not fair compared to a desert and snow biome.
Ize went full mustache man with being an extremely disliked and awkward person, to rise to power, to a perfect wartime fascist dictator to dying in misery.
Only L in video is the genshin impact
Jungle leader was a dick
Do a sequel
Next time if you do something like this again you should have mods that make it much more realistic :)
Moral of this social experience, don't do war first x)
desert for sure
Once i knew ize was the king.. there would be chaos!
Now this is the kind of history schools should teach..
desert i love them them are so good
Even tho I have never played Minecraft, this was Very fun to watch...great job👍
Crown mod name?
Brilliant video!
Eyes is the example of a power hungry cocky player which makes the game unenjoyable
watching the fight for power in the jungle civilisation was like animal farm all over again 😂
this will be so much fun if people think about using siege weapon (tnt cannon to bombard enemy home)
Um
That's lame. To really simulate the civilization it should be with terrafirma craft
Maybe jungle would have won if they didn't attack straight away
Damn, I was rooting for Star, he seemed to know what was best for his people. And I loved the arctic civilization.
i loved the artic civilisation,it was very harmonic and very nice,the desert one was creative and can survive in the desert with lack of trees,the jungle one was chaotic,just like natzi they attacking too fast and they tought win eazy
That guy deserve some credits cause he just built amongus statue😂😂😂😂😂
i need a season 2 for this
What is your name??? Really
I love the desert
Genshin impact God's we pray to all the arcons
I would love to play this
nooo the artic...why
Btw this video was posted on my birthday.
As much as I hated ize, he did have a point. They needed to get strong and fight them. But he rushed into the desert to quickly and it eventually led to him dying. If he strategized a bit, he probably could have won
Silver bro your growing super fast last time I saw you you were less than a million subscribers you were at like 300k subs but now a million in just a couple of years great keep doing what love and never ever give up.
I wanna see another episode of this I fuckin loved this
So who killed the last few arctic players? Last I saw they were stealing the enchantment table from desert but then got killed by who? I’m guessing jungle cause they were kinda allied with desert
The jungle definitely had the best story
Like the genshin impact battle music
Ain't no way I'm a squid kid was in this video, if you don't know who I'm a squid kid is he's from Technoblades potato War trilogy
JackTBC is my favorite now😂
I loved the jungle nation 😂
video shoulda been called ‘rust in minecraft’
Hi I love your videos
Dude this is the most entertaining thing I have seen in a long time. I was HOOKED!
Amazing work. That was probably veeeery hard. Good work man.
Ize’s main drawback was his straight toxicity, he ignored the fact that a king isn’t only a military ruler, but a leader that keeps his people uplifted. And it’s telling that his initial supporters were people that intentionally sabotaged the jungle nation for no reason other than self gain/ enjoyment. Hell, even if he simply chose to cooperate with star even if the former was still king they likely would have won. It’s the reason his people turned against him and he had to force them to submit
Can you join something like this
The zombie dude helping his kingdom is the definition of "Even in death, I serve"
Can you put the link below for the mod plez I want to play sum then like shape shipter
i feel great for being able to see the downfall of that jungle tribe king, starkiller would be the Best king and maybe he would bring peace and alliance with other kingdons... sadly they killed him and made very bad decisions and nobody was suspicious of it...
R.I.P Jungle :(
The fact he says begun every time he should say began is infuriating
ize logic: i got cocky and wanted king over someone who should’ve actually had it, got king, and still assassinated the person who posed no threat
ize is the sole reason the jungle kingdom lost
jungle kingdom was real chad
Need to do this again but with two factions of Ize vs Starkiller
I liked izee
Do a part 2
Did anyone notice that the music in the bg is from genshin impact????
Love that nostalgic Mario music
goddam the genshin music
What kind of legend is he
If this isn't staged, it is frightening....  One guy become rich by chance -> think he deserve power -> is a huge douche loose to democracy -> take power by murder -> wage war being petty  DAMN this look too real
jungle
Things I liked in this video:- Invictable bringing back the zombie of Abstrekt and him killing the last jungle player. StarKiller's friendliness. Suep's determination to his Kingdom. Susmas Tree. Amoung Us Statue. Church of Seup. Monke Statue. Joelbtw(ruler of desert)'s wise decisions of not wanting war but being prepared for it. Ize's military strats.
I wish people like these just said the truth and said how many players they are fr bru
I loved the jungle intil they betrayed starkiller
Technoblade ruined squidkid XD
I WOULD VOTE FOR STARKILLER
The Jungle king was soooo naive bruh... In fact, the only reason he won his first war was cuz of his army.
WOW THIS IS EPIC!!!!
Can we talk about how the jungle king was basically hitler
Jungle king is the type of person you dont elect..
Can you do 1000 pls
Great video ideas man
Jungle
Soup knew how to survive. Sadly he met his maker trying to help that dick, that's what you get.
I like dessert the most, has a great civilization
Im not sign in and my tab no minecraft:(
We Need Part 2!!!!!
Jungle election represents real life elections:                CHAOS GALORE
35:51 I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD HIS “gosh” SOUNDED LIKE THE MUGMAN VIDEO WHERE HE SAYS “gee golly!” LMAOOOOO
the best was jungle
The poor arctic group… I was rooting for them
What is absolutely hilarious about this entire situation is that the Jungle was by far the most defensible position. They were on an isolated island with an open view of almost any attacking force, mining beneath them would be pretty difficult, and outside the island the Jungle would be easily the hardest biome to cross, it retained higher numbers of mobs than either desert or snow biome would have due to the trees.  In fact the main downfall of the jungle was that there was no long term strategy for actual invasion, the entire plan was essentially, just spend the entire time fighting, but there was clearly no rally point, not thoughts on defending their own village and the advantage of surprise against the snow biome put everyone at risk, in fact the plan which seemed to be straightforward makes no real sense, because the advantage of surprise is only viable if no one knows whats going on. And in a battle where the goal is elimination an all out attack wouldn't make sense, instead after the Snow People were defeated they should have either set up in a defensible position within that village or retreated, since combined numbers of Snow + Desert gave them a severe advantage over the jungle village wouldn't have had the disadvantage of being surprised if they had established a fortified position, and could have won.
You made players so forced then
Ize is the kind of person I compketly disgust. He did NOTHING for the Team. Only cared for himself and then got eleczed, bevause he threatened the others with his selfish power.  He is like an aggresive dictator nobody likes.
100 Players Simulate Zombie Apocalypse Civilization!?
Preston,nestorio,and techno are in the vid right
You could put all of your favorite mods and play it
Jungle kingdom literally became pseudo North Korea
hey i wont stand for the squid kid slander
40:28 don’t steal from trixyblox he spent a long time making that you can’t just copy it
That guy izez sounds like a guy who had has  10,000$  nasa computer w 500fps just to get a huge advantage on game just to get killed by a ps3 players and rage quit… “you only killed me lucky you’re not better than me”
Is your opd channel speedsilver?
Mohon dukung Chanel Faby Meta
This video is totally not a copy of magicgum's video
What is the seed for this map? great experiment btw.
Spoiler: like every tyrant power, it never ends well
The fact that a big portion of Jungle players didnt support Ize and were kinda pacifists and even denied to join the Arctic ambush yet after the success of the Ambush all of them got bloodthirsty and even the player which was always against ize and said stuff like”This is not what Starkiller wouldve done” turned to “He is a good guy but im glad he died” shows us a lot about how people can be easily manipulated and misguieded by greed.Great video as always!
The jungle civilization reminds me of Nazi Germany
My favorite was the desert, and they already showed you why, I don´t need to explain. Strong bond between its members, shown by having their dead teammate get to their new town as a way to remember him, surely was important in their win.
that was awesome! all the participants were great. the buildings were cool. I do wonder what would have happened if StarKiller was still around. And if diplomatic meetings could have been upheld. might have been a lousy ending
I wish history class was like this 🥲
to be honest. Jungle civilization got what they deserved after betraying star.
This was eerily similar to ww2.
Jungle had the same strategies as the Nazis, first be op then lose heavily
Awesome video
I really hope for Ize's family that he's a different person irl
Technoblade is always the best farmer
How can you join one of these server
Make more I love the video
Sequel
Another civilization video
I think Ize would've won that if he employed better strategy, than just run in and kill everything kinda way, because while outnumbered, that doesn't work as well.
This is just like Game of Thrones 😂😂
Was rooting for jungle until ize was elected, how did he truly think he was gonna win?
The ice civilization was the best
Izen is my favorite he was the most brave one and actually wanted to take over. I'm glad the other king didn't get elected or they would have been sitting ducks
Sqoid kid is sooooo mad right now
I respect The Jungle King, He's clearly making statements, If They stayed on the Island its over, they're gonna get outnumbered and outgeared Just like a True Civilization, The others didnt want to Invade without Glory, Props to this King and Other Jungle Factions that were determined to Fight
I prefer the jungle
Greak civil vs norse civil
Legends know he has builds inspired by trixyblox
Jungle you where thé chosen one 😂😭
desert builds were better
F for 34:51 guy o7
artic
How do I join these
Man I like the artic so if i was there i would probably be with the artic
I actually hate ize acting like he’s the big man boss 😩
#siryakari zkus to taky
bruh tthe dessert group had cows
I wanted anyone but the Irish to win
Yes sepual pls that would  e awesome
I dont really like that ize guy
Arctic was the best in my opinion
The dessert vs jungle war kinda reminded me of the tang dynasty vs Abbasid war
I just stopped playing genshin cuz i got bored and you really had to didn’t you (also who is excited for ayato)
join this discord server  https://discord.gg/94r6Ubrb
pls pin this
Really cringe Genshin impact advertising but great video
I like genshin impact but I just comeback, missing lots of event D:
👏👍
Suep played bes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ize was soo cringe when talking about inch of personality.  Its like if you gave a money hungry poor person a nuke. Now the money hungry poor person with a nuke becomes a leader. Just full thrust of war, fear, betrayal, lying and threatening own people if they don't join him. He did manage to kill artic but lost because he was extremely arrogant
In toycat did it first!
I didn’t know you can kill birds until  level 7 I shot them as a joke.
Everyone be complaning about izy’s strategies but without them the show would be so boring
what would happen if silver fought dream?
love the genshin music in the background
jungle couldve won by splitting from the north and south and if it was more organized rip i was rootin for em
Make more of those, this was fun to watch :D I enjoyed it so much
My favourite was arctic
That jungle leader deserved that karma
Desert kingdom my fav
I swear you can learn alot about humanity in this video.
If I’m being honest, ize was a tyrant
Kachaw
That ize dude in the jungle... how the fuck did he win the election, the only thing he had was gear, he had a terrible personality and terrible leadership
nice vid :DDDDDDD
I like and support jungle civilization the most because their have great strategies and experience in battle. First I expect their win but unfortnately desert take the throne. Great Contain 👍🏻😍
I liked starkiller
Holy shit, what a storyline. Ruthless jungle dictatorship drafts people into the war, wiping out the arctic. Arctic resistance goes on, slaying any jungle people they come across, even defecting refugees.  The arctic flee to the desert, and essentially the arctic-desert alliance combined defeat the attackers,  Good ending tbh, Arctic GANG
should’ve nuked the jungle civ after star died.
great idea for a video
15:13 that scream! 21:19 and that distorted sound note that I can't say earr***. 22:03 again... 26:41 XxX😂 F 37:22 lol 38:24 😂😥😂 39:48 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Plz upload on speed silver, you were one of the best skyblock players
I am subbed and I liked your videos
Can I be in one of the civilizations
"and you guys killed none of them?"  "gosh..."
Genshin impact is low-key fun and I've been playing it like 2 in months before this sponser
I love it how he always makes an ad in all videos and makes it interesting
I like how the jungle king gave himself the best gear then assassinated his political rival and wiped out an entire nation.
make one seson two
Ize is the kind of person I would rather be enemies with, his ego is so strong it makes him weaker to everyone else because he thinks he can overpower others so much that his need for blood overcame strategy, which proved to be his downfall.
THE JUNGLE DEF! the king(eyes) had very good points and could have lead them to victory! this was amazing and I would def be a warrior!
Just gonna say that genshin impact battle music is playing in the background
Maturing is realizing starkiller was the better option, ize was giving dictatorship vibes, he was litterly going to kill those who didn’t obey him, star would do that.
ABSTRAKT SERVES TO THE GRAVE!
Seemed like a movie
what if you did the same thing, but instead of 100 players spread into 3 areas, what if you got double or triple the amount, the war and cooperation would be insane, but of course it would take time, but it'd be worth it for the views (probably)
I was rooting for jungle, I liked the leader a lot
isn't  the exact same video that magic gum made just with a Genshin sponsorship and a different voice over and a different stolen thumb nail https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc8w_VKlUCo?
Man I hope ize was just a master roleplayer because he doesn't seem like a fun guy to play a game with
9:03 "Jump if you like children" in other words
nice vid dude :)
i was so happy when that kid that tried to betray ize dies
Ize is literally the bratty bitch king that betrays the peacfull wise king sorta poetic
Dude's last words were "I HAD A COW" ☠😂
You copied magicgums thumbnail
i love the earthbound music in the background lol
Bro.. jungle has a dictatorship💀
Seeing incells trying to make a democracy is fun.
this will go down as king of minecraft series
The arctic kingdom was so cool and chill And I felt really bad for them when their population melted away during the invasion but I’m really proud of the desert kingdom.  They were also a really nice group.   It would’ve been cool to see the arctic and desert join forces and just vibe together but Ik it was unrealistic to hope for.
the goal was to survive until the end not conquer the jungle nation had it coming from the beginning
I remember when you made the 100 days in halloween video
It's people like Ize that ruin casual games
Jungle king is the worst
This proves dictators never win
The jungle king was so toxic I'm glad he lost
I loved  jungle they were so real
Desert was the most calm civilization they didn’t have trouble electing king like snow or have a rebellion like jungle or distrust
What the fuck is rong with the jungel king stark killer shold be king what the fuck

Silver I plead with you do a sequel please 🥺
Jungle become to fall😎
someone could right a play out of this.
Loved Suep ans jungle king
That dude star killer kinda pisses me off
My favorite nation is the ice one. It's sad that they got attacked.:(
GO JUNGLE. OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The ravager made me HATE u
i like desert and ice peoples cause they are not toxic
Genshin impact  Really dude that’s worse than raid shadow legends it’s worse and for weebs
I was really rooting for artic as they all were in harmony
i liked the artic the best
Anyone else feel like desert kingdom totally should've won the building competition? Especially considering their disadvantages for getting resources, they did a really good job! And Silver mentioned that the jungle kingdom "had lore," but so did the desert kingdom, with their temple and necromancy lab! IF anything, they had MORE lore!
I love this video
The desert kingdom was like the religious community, the jungle kingdom was mired in political conflict, and meanwhile the artic kingdom was just living their best lives and having an amazing time as friends LMAO
Silver, I want to join the next Civilization game. Please let me join and I will be a good player
YOU GAVE NO CREDIT TO MAGIC GUM AND MADE MONEY OFF OF HIS IDEA
I like the jungle and arctic once
This is how I want to play this game.
Loved the video but with that genshin impact ad I just had to dislike
that guy said oh genshin impact hell yeah baby is lil SuS to me ....   send this part of message to that player  susss......
The laaaaaaag
the jungle village sucked how did they get first
Plz put the video of shapesfiter
Every minecraft civilization video have the: Borderline mentally ill dictator who only care about war, power, and the military. democratic leader who got assasinated by the military faction Rich pacifist desert civilazation. The loner solo player that get the best loot early game The guy that hoards cow (???)
ize played a very convincing delusional paranoid dictator similar to WW2-era fascists, really good video
I was kinda rooting for jungle ngl..
Nice vid but we still waiting for that final end manhunt
Persians ;)
I like jungle
Holy, this is actually great video and idea, really want to see another one Civilization video!
I just love this video its like a movie
X
The fact that im playing genshin rn while watching this is just-
Imagine someone who moves likes king technoblade with a vice capt like dream with create survival experience then a pro red stoner or trap maker like mumbo jumbo the team would highly win.
Artic kings were shit, Jungles problem was players not cooperating properly, Desert is just clumsy players
The jungle reich!
u need 2m sub
This video made me rlly happy and made my day. Im not sure why but it just had a different feel to it and made me rlly happy :]]
i was rooting for the jungle nation
Genshin music in the background
Can you do another one of these?
dude this is one of the best videos on YouTube 😵😵😮😮
I liked Jungle boo deseet
i was team desert
damn I liked arctic
Pls do mor vids like this
dude, how did you get 1 million so fast? i remember watching your skyblock videos yeaaars ago on ur other channel lol.e
Jesus is the way, The truth, and the Life! The only way you can get to the father (Jehovah) is through Jesus! God bless you all!
Jesus is the way, The truth, and the Life! The only way you can get to the father (Jehovah) is through Jesus! God bless you all!
The Jungle King is A Dictator who rules with iron fist...The Arctic King is a King who think positively even in hopeless situation and the Dessert King is resourceful...
The amount of ads on this video is fucking absurd
Part 2 plz
Ize is the type of dude to blame the society for problems that he caused and then wonder why they revolt
Are you gonna make another one of these?
Damn am I the only one that liked ize I thought he made everything really interesting
This gives me avatar the last airbender vibes for some reason
bro eyes is just gonna recreate WW2 germany
I liked jungle, they were very strong
This is cool content, please make more of these
The Jungle team lost because they were outnumbered and rushed
iiz is so annoying
20:14
slay.
लय भारी
no one going to talk about starkiller?
they didn't do anything and still won... Jeez, Desert didn't really deserve the win. jungle did. because the yactually got of thier buts and attacked.
I didnt know why but i was in desert team immediately
Honestly at first I liked the Jungle nation, but the Desert nation's Undead Soldier sold it for me. My favorite nation in this video was the Desert Nation. They had significant losses at the beginning, but those losses strengthened them until they were unstoppable.
This is actually so fascinating. Ize’s tactics reminds me of Napoleon or Julius Caesar. It’s surprisingly accurate to society and it’s cool how well this shows how history develops
21:21 I laughed so hard.
This would be awesome as a movie.
I knew jungle was gonna lose king had way too much ego
minecraft civilization should literally an update
34:55 lmao what was that kid thinking
server ip please?
Ize is honestly a knob
What if he were to do a similar experiment themed around maze Runner
Ize was a much better king. He did make a terrible mistake after attacking Artic to go for desert, that was stupid. He tried to win as a team leading them into battle but let his ego take over. Could of won as they had 17 players after Artic were attacked - one thing that didn’t cross their mind is that they now controlled 2/3 of the map. They should of prepared and set up a trap for desert letting them come to us. The position of King usually  is portrayed as best in combat so I would of had both of them naked fighting to the death on flat terrain. No point someone having insane buffs and can only plant carrots.
Man’s using new super Mario bros wii level 2 music
Lord of the Rings
jungle sounds like a cod lobby
I'm just gonna say it, Ize has got to be the most annoying and entitled player EVER
Ize is the kid in a tracksuit and a switchblade lol
Ize was in the right and the fact that he's treated as a villain in the comments pisses me off. Star truly was doing nothing and jungle would've been last.
“I’m gonna elect myself king. Sound good?” “Umm, no.” Bruh that shit had me dying
I feel like the jungle was like the Argentine military Junta, starting fights to ensure the loyalty of the people then losing when their military has to keep fighting when they aren't ready 😂
Great concept, I'd watch another one of these for sure. Liked and subbed!
👍❤
The jungle king is the most entertaining one :D
This is defiantly scripted
why not add to the mix bandits ?
This video was sick! I was rooting for the ice region once they got attacked
I love this, maybe next time with more factions?
Plz make another one
I liked the jungle civilization for being barave enough to fight 25 players
wow, I loved that content. please keep on making more content like that.
If the jungle had won, ize would have been the main hero of the story (despite his methods) and star killer would kinda have been the villain ( being opposed to change and all)  In summary, it's simply who wins the war thats the hero
L players genshin shit
The ice
Genshin is a shit
Let’s go desert
Genshin impact i L but video is a W.
Try make something like this in bedrock.
Yes we want a sequel
When they will learn?  "Don't attack First when there's more than 2 faction" Better just flee, wait and watching them fight with other faction and then give them finish blow.
Hey start a series in better minecraft
The editing in this video is incredible
Triangle Strategy before it came out
Loyalty til the end !
Great content!
"Caught off guard by a creeper" me: that's a phantom
Wardens helmet goog
fake (rigged) 31:24 kkkkkkkk 32:48 kkkkkkkk
i cant get over his accent
Felt like a movie, would love to have a sequel
Early game aggression was unwise. Once you've established yourself the strongest, everyone else will go against you cooperatively to save their heads. That's why tyrants fall.
2:21 to 2:26 is so lol, techno is the best potato farmer
Jungle
did no one else notice how he spelt civilisation wrong?
The artic was peacefull
Can we give respect to the jungle king he did what is right to his subjects
Funi artic
i was with jungle =(
the fall of the arrogant leader. 🤣😂
Awesome! Glad the arctic won
Jungle
Jungle should’ve got last place in the build lowkey
man it sucked that the Artic got hit like that, they were such a wholesome civilization
Everyone saying Ize had no losses, despite his reckless strategy of sprinting through the jungle during the blood moon costing the lives of a handful of players.
27:34 Yeah, he didn't decide that the ambush was too good to lose, he has a massive ego and refused to admit that his terrible plan cost the lives of players for literally no gain. Man was an absolute prick.
That guy at 16:35 is such an annoying fuck *what have you been doing* like he just got you guys an enchantment table that 90% of you were bitching at him to drop i woulda betrayed them so hard bro 😑😑
Just delete the last Game of Thrones season and put this video in
Rip the Arctic.
The Jungler's Leader was a dictator
The Arctic Civilization just be chillin, man.
I wanna play the next one lol
man ize is so toxic, i hate the spineless dudes who back him up, walk softly yet carry a big stick, dont just be an ass
Arctic was the best the whole way through
make a part two, taiga village, ocean and jungle
best civilization vid no cap
I'm happy that second king from the junglw died slowly. Thwy should have stayed with starkiller
Why your voice have to sound like that though
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER AND JUNGLE KING EVIL BUT GOLD TOWN NICE AND VICTORIES GOLD TOWN FOREVER! Oh and Arctic captain Soup Evil To And Killed The Only Jungle Player Working with Them And Tried To Save The Person Who Took Out His Entire Nation
oh nice and dont need discord to join interesting I will forsure keep that in mind i dont use discord at all so it saddens me when most events go through that weird app XD so thankful for the videos though even some good series! stay awesome and I seen a bunch of like 1v1v1v1 of these cutting the 200 in groups of like 25% but would love to see a war simulation on a big map surrounded by water and with one them god temples to make evets every 3 days that would be cool to see with just split in half at start so 50% each side to start
Is that new enchantment
I stopped watching when Star killer lost election
Ima be honest I was rooting for desert and jungle but definitely jungle more because they seemed to have an upper hand in the game and was more militaristic than the desert or artic as the desert was more diplomatic and the artic was more chaotic
Jungle got way too greedy
I really liked the jungle capital
My favorite was definitely the Jungle. They gave off that unyielding "FOR THE EMPEROR" energy.
That was amazing
i think you know we know that you know hypixel skyblock needs a revisit
Tbh. The artics were kinda weak but I loved how they tried to enjoy the game until war came, then I honestly disliked their unwillingness to actually join the desert. The jungle was starting good with star but ize was downright awful as both a person and a leader from head to toe and from start to finish. He literally had no strategy except K I L L. The sand tho, I never go a good grasp of them but they seemed nice since they offered refuge to the artic when they could've just ended them.
Ize is the true dictator
I loved the jungle kingdom but when star killer died, I wanted desert to win
I like jungle until Starkiller died
Genshin music on the background fits really well tho
38:52 "And like that, the reign of the Tyrant King was over" End of Chapter
My favourite was jungle until ize became king then I wanted Arctic to win but when Arctic was all gone I wanted desert to win
the downfall of jungle tribe was overhyped sccater after few kills on desert. Should have sticked togather and keep rolling them
I’m sad the jungle didn’t win
I think this was more of a social experiment than a Minecraft event lmao. Incredible results
Really Cool
35:08 absolute karma
more of these civ vids pls
i'm french i don't understand because you speak speed but i like this video gg
This is interesting
This makes a perfect movie: 1 weak nation, 1 corrupt nation, 1 stable nation, with the corrupt nation shows its true villain and asshole scheme while stable nation show the justice
First place definitely should have got the mob not the last
The first of the video was like a Rise Of Kingdoms ad
Pls make another one
LET'S GO
Make more
8:40 Mini Heart Attack.
Artic was so happy they were singing while jungle were having war with each other
Ize pisses me off
J’adore le concept!
desert is Cool and strong
35:50 gosh
RIP STAR NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Am I the only one who noticed he used Genshin music in the background of the video lol
it's nice how you used genshin ost's for your video
Elects himself leader when he literally didn´t do shit to help further his civilization, hid necessary resources that would strengthen his team and assassinate anyone who didn´t agree with his plans. Good riddance, I would hate to play with someone like that.
The Arctic Kingdom is the perfect example of what happens when your kingdom is weak compared to the invading kingdom: you get screwed. That’s why the Arctic kingdom should have put all its focus on gearing up to defend itself.
Artic ppl are so nice
Was rlly rooting for jungle nation because i liked starkiller's determination. But man the nation completely turned into a dictatorship lol
sequel pleeeeasse
Jungle king🤡
Starkiller was true leader...
What does starkiller have that I don’t? Hes not a cunt, thats enough
While the jungle attacked the artic The dessert could ambush the jungle
The guy tahat died to the creeper in the jungle during the hunger event saved the afk person
Starkiller would have made the jungle win
To give Ize atleast some credit, he was right by attacking first with his guys, even if the persuasion tactic to get the others along wasn't great. That made their team unpredictable and cost the other group alot of time to gear up for a fight, because they thought they had a civil war. He should've called it off after the first attack to regroup but Ize saw blood and was to trigger happy, leading to then get killed. Also props to Starkiller, he looked pretty promising if he was king, supporting his people. But who knows what could've happened and who would've attacked first in that scenario.
If I were the last player of the jungle village... I would have used my tnt as a trap if they invade.. of course once u finish the trap u should be on the surface to wait
I never thought i could dislike someone as much as Ize, with his ‘I want something why aren’t you giving it to me’ attitude
They fight fearless man
Omg this was so cool the jungle is the coolest
Did not expect that ending
14:50 lol
Genshinnn
Ize is just awful, I know he gets the drama/content to the vid, but I wouldn’t want to be in the same server with a person like that
I just want to know how to join, seems like a lot of fun
you know an indian youtuber can create 100 videos from this whole video .😂 .
please do more videos like this! i was really invested in how things would turn out
that jungle guy was making me angry cuz he was so clearly toxic lol
From the start I was with desert kingdom
Does anybody know of a server that does something like this? I would love to participate in something like this
Fuck that jungle king guy, the downfall of them, knew the super aggressive civ would lose, especially crossing all that land at night. Too bad the artic team lost, liked them, but glad desert won in the end. GG desert
NEver GOnna GiVe YOu
Bo why you did this sad for those 3 people who die being took there bonus box Lol
Jungle was best
Happy with that ending lol
After what the jungle did to star I wanted them to lose so badly
MAKE MORE OF THESE VIDS THERE THE BEST
another one
Please do another one of these
Omfg dude this is beyond a social experiment.. u r god
Jungle easily could have won under better leadership, i think overall ize was better than starkiller would have been, but he choked on his ambitions a little bit, he should have went home to regroup and recuperate before launching an invasion of desert, im sure he could have even pulled more people to attack desert after they saw his success with arctic
Idea: Do this again with same rules and everything but have a “Void Tower” event where three chosen ones have full prop 4 netherite and OP swords Rules for the three chosen ones -no animals to help in combat -no more upgrading your loot -must not exit the tower -cannot give away or join other civilisations  At the very top there could be chest full of OP potions and armour plus enchants and exclusive weapons from mods. Whoever defeats the tower or which civilisation defeats it they get the ownership of it as well. Good idea?
o7
This blew up you should make a part 2
Ize needed to be humbled
the last jungal player in dimond and iron armour unenchanted: how do i win?  you: kill all elevn of them  the last jungal player: that sounds easy enough
Desert kingdom lol
I vote ize for being a waffle since he like waffling around
the most interesting thing here was the zombie player ngl
The jungle king giving me Macbeth vibes
6:11 this guy has great background music choice
Ize reminds me of Stalin
history all over
The traders are a bunch of snowflakes
The zoo tycoon music
so they pillaged a native population.... even in the ideal scenario... things still happen
Fire vid, first I’ve seen of yours. Immediate subscriber
Please do this again!!!
I never thought I'd ever see a video with Squid kid and it again man did you really have to diss him like that
Such an L on the votes the jungle village was so ugly
Gayshine impact sucks!
Hold up, you MADE them do it. What'd you do kidnap their families or somethin?
What if I don't have twitter and can't get it?
Tyranny never works out.
21:09 squid saying "YOU'RE SICK" around here is so fucking funny to me-
Who ever did that to the amogus statue is a menace 🤣🤣🤣🙄
I wish jungle would win
I mean i personally wouldn't like ize but hey someone said " a king that is feard is better than a king that is loved by their people"
Do more videos like this
Best Minecraft content I've ever watch
Poor arctic lol
Deep inside i wanted jungle team to win
I wonder how it would look like, if they actually would build a real kingdom
artic
This project are amazing! Wow...Beautiful like a movie and it's egregious edited!  We can analyze 1000 times how works a civilization but... every time the things take only one way. 3 is the perfect number to this type of project because we see: -The pacifists -The democratics -The militarists  ((Why nobody have make the boundaries walls to defend the village to enemies using the netherite? I see they have a good amount of lava.))
Nooo I already have it
BROOOO the zombie team member actually helping was so so SO unexpected I love it
The fact that the king from the jungle had to give it to them okay by Plat to get the crown is sad I would have jumped right in you need an actual  server where it gets brutal no bullcrap all game
All for the Jungle Kingodm!!! The guy had some serious leader abilities.
Incredible
I was rooting for mainly desert, but also wanted to see jungle win tbh. Anyone except the artic. The artic was the most disorganised bunch, they could only rely on backstabbing.
I love how he used the genshin fighting music after the sponsor LMAO
i liked the jungle
bro the king of the jungle nation 💀
wow it's almost like being the most powerful person doesn't qualify you to be a good leader or something. Who coulda guessed. Man's straight up led his team like they had to rush in bedwars because the enderdragon was about to spawn.  Also Ize was just kind of a dick. It's been proven time and time again that killing the people who disagree with you just doesn't work out in the long run.
Jungle King's just a chad
how do we sign up to take part of this? would love to do it
pls do more of this
dessert
I like the desert
People are probably going to disagree with me on this but I rooted for the jungle factions. No reason, I just they were very strong and could've won if they maybe took a defensive strategy instead of rushing through the deserts.
that ize guy was so arrogant
Geneshin impact is MID
i have genshin impact over a half year now and 60 primogems is not alot
Jungle
GO ARTARTICA WHO!!
Ize is fucking foul for what he did
Everyone hail to the man who was making among us statues during the build battle.
"Second best potato farmer"  *NOW THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE*
I'm loving the Genshin soundtracks.
Death to the evil dictator jungle king! He proves why I hate kings!
The Jungle Kingdom honestly would've won if they actually had a strategy instead of letting Ize's ego get to him and just straight up charging like he's gonna win a 1 vs 100.
You have met Nestor cool
Ize going h#tler mode
35:10 that kid was so annoying
I am not gonna lie the Ize guy was the most unlikeable guy in this whole series. Literally wouldn't play with someone like him
"Oh these aren't people"
I love minecraft bro
I am one of the only people to route for Ize and the jungle because he was overall right, if they would have followed star killer they would have been like the artic weak and eventually be invaded and destroyed
The funniest part is the thumbnail is an exact copy
That zombie member thoo lmao
The nod to technoblade being the best potato farmer was legendary
Why do you talk like that 💀
The best potato farm- Yeah I read that wrong...second best potatofarmer
This is the most entertainjng Minecraft vidoe i ever seen..!!! ngl, am not minecraft player but this is soo awesome..!!! sub+like+ bell, hope there is part 2❤
Speed, can you please play skyblock again and post it on your main channel (speedsilver)
This was basically a tv series.
this was so good, what????? amazing
That was legendary
Need more of this 100 players challenges  Love the content
I LOVED the snow kingdom because they were peaceful and my favorite season is winter
The dessert and the arctic
Desery wooo
☕
The Jungle Kingdom is a perfect example of the danger of following a bad leader. The majority of the jungle tribe clearly did not really like their leader and did not want to follow him or be violence focused, but they made concession after concession until they were bloodthirsty themselves, eventually leading to their downfall.
I love how the jungle kindom became tyranical and necropolitical thanks to the leader that blames his teammates when they fail, reminds me of Germany way back when
i like the desert and the arctic tho :)
Starkiller is what you'd call a "nice guy"
Im just happy that that ize guy didnt win, people with no compation dont have leadership, they have dictatorship, they relly on fear to rule other, so disrespectful
Eww disturbing genshin impact
I remember when you made a knockback 1000 video that's didnt even have 500k views, you come so far I'm so proud of you, keep up the good word
I hated jungle after their first leader died in that other guy I just hated him so I’m not sure if I hate jungle I’m just saying your 2nd leder was unbelievable so jungle was just sabotaged
This is such a creative game mode. A game studio should definitely consider similar ideas
whos the smartest king here
I love how the dude just found some diamonds and celebrates while his people are starving to death lol
More videos like this would be awesome
Arctic 100% jungle sucked it was terrible
HIS VOICESSEE XD
NO GUYS DONT INSTALL GENSHIN IMPACT YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON THIS TINY ACTION
Ize is the type of arrogant hypocritical person I hate the most I’m glad he had such a reality check Soup was awesome tho
i like jungle but HATE desert
loved desert from the start bc of their zombie ally lol
i hate that jungle kid he is.... how would you say... ah a tryhard
Man I ain’t even gonna lie, even if Genshin wanted to sponsor me, I wouldn’t let them
As A guy from middle east the desert people are the best out of all reminds me of Egyptians in ancient world
I liked the jungle kingdom at first but then when they raided the Arctic I felt sad and then joined the Arctic and desert
dude.... the artic one whas so perfect... so good... and why... WHY WHYYYYYYYYY D,:
Jungles leader was so annoying I’m glad he died😂
yeah, that's what happens when one guy takes over
Yo xNestorio joined I love that guy
I liked the ice civilization
2:55 why would you play a game and then promote another game?? It makes no sense
LOL "second best potato farmer in MC squid kid"
Unoriginal Bozo
i like black mokenys
Bro Ize is fucking cracked! He had to be 5v1 'ed by 1 king and 7 DECKED OUT members and a zombie for him to be killed, what a fucking legend!
The editing and animation on this video is superb, just amazing man, great job
Ize was starting to sound a bit like hitler
Damn, I was rooting for Star, he seemed to know what was best for his people. And I loved the arctic civilization.
super cool comme mode de jeux si tu pouvais en faire un serveur sa serait génial
This is such an interesting idea, it makes spies and traitors much more realistic if they only have one life on the server
Great to watch. Also very glad at the outcome. And now I have this to say:  Now the world sees that you are a jerk Ize, good luck pulling the same stuff any time in the future. You got what you deserved for killing the fun for others.
Totally original thumbnail
too bad I missed this... Would have been nice to kill off everyone and name myself supreme overlord!
Basically copied another video pic but still good content
yes lets make some guy who only knows how to tell people good job as leader
Kind of funny how "Sitting on the Island eating carrots waiting for the other nations to grow stronger" worked out for the dessert team. That jungle king was to full of himself after finding some diamond.
MY FAVORITE KINGDOM WAS ARCTIC KINGDOM
Can you give link to download this Map???
I don't speak English very well, I didn't understand everything, but it was extraordinary, it was the first time I saw one of your videos, I immediately subscribed, can't wait for you to do episode 2
ah yes New Super Mario Bros Wii Jungle Music, Aswell As Nsmbw Desert Music
Very good movie Silver, thanks for that. My favourite team was arctic cause i think they were there for fun and pleasure game. I didnt like Ize, he was cocky and awful.
The JUNGLE team carried the video
I was kind of rooting for the Arctic after suep made that comeback. Also I am a builder and I think the Arctic region's builds we're the best.
shoutout to ish13c
Arctic
ඩාPlease do another post I love your video ඩා
This video made my dad tysm
i feel bad for saitama and ize, both good at the game and smart
jungle king was so lame
Hasta Siempre Starkiller
This is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. I’d love to take part in something like this someday
i want to make a petition to rename the jungles leader fürher.
Plz more
Plz mote
I like desert
I like dessert
Bro insane, gain one sub, do a part 2 with more players
Do more civilisation
Dang I was heartbroken watching the Arctic get killed. They were so chill. After their downfall I was totally just then rooting for Dessert. THIS WAS FUN TO WATCH
can we get speedsilver back ?
these mc channels always be popping
यस बीआरओ
Just stole the whole thumbnail 💀
Jungle king's mindset was like hitler Lol
I gotta see another one of these
F in chat for Starkiller
Ize is so disgusting, Starkiller is 100× better, Ize is greedy,selfish, hungry for war. I thought artic was kind but nope and switched to desert.
I hope that ize and the kids that stole temple loot are scummy kids. And the kid that killed star. Y’all ruined the video
Lmao I dream of this when I was a kid
This video was super entertaining and impressive 💯 ik this had to take a Lot of time. Props 🙌
I could tell the jungle kingdom would fall from the moment Ize started to rant. Power-hungry king: story as old as time.
And people say Democracy doesn't work.
Ngl would have been cool if the jungle dude that the artic general killed stayed alive and joined the desert. Would have been really poetic if he was the one to kill the jungle king
Ize was definitely the best leader of the three kingdoms and CERTAINLY was the best PvP player on server. Can't see anyone on here killing him. 6 on 1 with zombie and he still was making it out, until being cornered with the sneaky ice king 😂😂
6:40 Woah, just like real life.
Can you make apps for these videos here? Because I’m not allowed to have Twitter. :(
That was awesome!
stolen idea
I felt like I watched a movie. Humble beginnings, blooming leadership, subterfuge and betrayal, the underdog victory….. Incredible!
I like zelda more than genshin
I was rooting Arctic, idk why but every civilization video i always like Arctic
30:44 HAHAHAHHAH noo the amogus
anyone know the music at 18:35
I would have given the ravager to the jungle people just because theyre already tense so it would be super chaotic
Minecraft with civilization mod or system... Thats gonna be lit tho
It makes me thoroughly pleased that Ize ended up with his cheeks slapped.
Not gonna lie this was so dang cool
arctic team was so wholesome :,)
Do more of these it was so entertaining to watch loved the video, I wish they had this on Minecraft servers
Someone make this a movie
bro the jungle ppl are greedy for enchant and dont even give him credit when he is carrying the  nation :/
I love how the desert people let their dead teammate get a kill.
ize is just a jerk
bro IZE is such a good leader. assassinations aside this part CONVINCED me 28:44
Mario music gave me nostalgic feelings
hmm, maybe giving them completely biased drops isnt such a great idea. The winter biome got the worst drop AND a ravage why tf a ravager? couldnt you just give them trash loot?
1 down fall for jungle is the conflicts in them lol
ice didnt deserve to die
Jungle was my favorite until the new guy came around. Then I was rooting for desert.
gonna be honest i really hated ize. he was just an antagonistic asshole through the whole thing
The jungle nation was rigged from the start cuz ize tbh
:( It kinda sucked that they all just killed each other instead of pooling resources and becoming a super nation, it makes me sorta hopeless
Jungle civilization was easily the most interesting. I wish they won.
i started a few days 1 year ago before this video was uploaded for genshin impact
bro ize genuinely anoyed me lol
desert
This was perfect.
are you ever going to post another speed sliver video
I was rooting for both arctic and dessert but absolutely not for jungle cause Ize is a jerk
The best potato farmer- WAIT no techno is the best
Amazing. We need an another one
He'll ya man!!! more civilization videos I loved this video and I mainly subscribed and hit the bell because of this video keep up the amazing work 👍 😄😉👏👏👏👏👏
Gotta love the militaristic take over of the Jungle Kingdom, all hail king Ize!
2:21 bro you didn't have to do him like that lmao
Never seen a Better Minecraft video
Subbed for this amazing video. Please make another soon!!!
The jungle kingdom is so predictable
Ice was a good leader
i preffered the artic civilization than any one
LOVING THE GENSHIN MUSIC DURING THIS VIDEO
Jungle
Ah the potato wars good times
Already play genshin impact
Man that silly I am on my alt account so f these kids they are so bad I could kill them with a would sored and they could be in diamond and meteorite prop 4
Please do more this was so fucking good I could actually watch a series of this
starkiller couldnt even land a hit with his axe before being killed and people were about to elect him lmao
Damn bro the jungle king guy is annoying as hell
I love the artic civilization the most
Jungle civilization is fighting themselves and sabotaging themselves
Honestly this was pretty infuriating to watch. I get why all the drama Ize created can be considered good content, but I expected to see people enjoying Minecraft and coming up with ways to outsmart each other. Instead we just end up with a bully who made his own team miserable and used the most scummy ways to win. I wish his team gave him a harder time.
Loved the jungle nations leader
"Yo guys Im gonna elect myself king sound good?" *Silence* "No"
Ize honestly sounds like such a prick and it was funny to see his down fall. But even better was getting to see one of the first killed desert players zombie get the last kill for the win
I really like the artic nation
This is my first time watching your videos . The quality is sooo S tier   Nice video.... fr
I like how he changes his mind cause techno number 1 baby😎 2:20
Ice did lead his civilization into destruction though I loved the way he ruled
Man Ize got that power stick, happy that it got ripped away as fast as it came though.
32:34 Noob moment
Bro these are like in some movies, One of the kingdom is the cool cities, i think the arctic is the cool one, the poor but nice kingdom is the dessert, and the kingdom that are in a conflict that had the actual king dead assasinated by the current king, and then they started invading
That Mario Music 🎶 at the beginning 😂
the zombiie risked it all hahaahh
#jungleforever
i generally dont like minecraft content but that was pure gold keep it up
the fricking genshin music throws me off. Im like  "Wait do i have genshin open?!"
Boat
30 videos   and 1.9M subs O,O
I love your vids!
I was counting on the desert kingdom since they brought their zombified friend to their town
Hey how get on your server?
Starkiller - The man with leadership but wasn't power-hungry. Ize - A tyrant, a dictator, and a power-hungry villain. Much more like Hitler Soup - A patriot  It's sad because the reality of our world these days is that the wrong people are chosen to be in power while the righteous and kind are mocked and despised.
Snow
the Jungle leader was terrible, A toddler could be a better leader
noway the jungle won the building
I knew it that desert win
I would love to see a gamemode like this!
The arctic was the best
ize was a G bro. true alpha male ✊😤😤
Sorry genshin impact is not compatible to my phone
i miss speedsilver
OMG i Got Raiden when u said that
This video is insane
someone know a server that does this all the time? rlyy want to compete
Jungle has advantage but the other dia guy is selffis
The guy that tried to come off the jungle alliance and then died was satisfying. Stoopid arogance
I'm so glad Jungle lost, that King was a complete prick he was so annoying to listen to
Jungle was great but didn't have coordination
Jungle king, bad king
This whole premise gives me the last airbender vibes. Too bad there wasn’t an avatar.
This deserves a sequel :) or a series who knows ;)
Ones more
want more content like this.
Why is soup so dumb
can you make more
9:08 bruh that guy made the comedy better hahahaha
More civilizations please
I love java edition but I can only play bedrock edition because I don't have pc 😔  Note: can you do 100 days video in minecraft civilization?
desert team is better then all
I am so glad desert won, jungle had a toxic dirtbag king who got his men killed and only cared for himself and the last of artic were scum who would back stab people that could help them. so in the end the good guys one
Desert alwas win
13:06 Northern Irish Charm..  ( just a heads up, being cocky and passive aggressive , thinking you are the life and soul and know a right good old crack doesn’t make you charming…)  Used to date a girl from Enniskillen… all the blokes are like this in NI..
Artic
Ya did squid bad
I was honestly rooting for the jungle but the plot twist really caught me off guard
Bro Ize seems so aggressive
ize was the worst leader possible
The jungle was a dictatorship
Where do I sign up to be in one of these?
So more of this
I wanted the desert to win and the desert won
I'm glad to see ize's dictatorship fall due to overconfidence and greed
Tes
Weird how jungle pep were Vibing till war broke out and the died no offense but there leader reminded me of Russia
Ize seems like a very annoying teammate
I liked the arctic and their spirit and when star killers death happend I hated jungle when they turned
I was rooting for the jungle but after it was a tyranny I started hating it
Irish guy from the jungle is so cringe oml
A happy ending.
Wassup,  i'm a new content creator and i just would appreciate it if you check out my brand new video and give me some feedback! I'm trying to grow and improve and if you like what i do subscribe!
I just want Silver to upload on SpeedSilver
Tbh I wanted jungle to win
Honestly I loved the video until that dude ize got so self absorbed it's my least favorite characteristic
Does anyone know what mods were used? Specifically the "role" one.
It was so satisfying when jungle lost under their tyrant
R I P star killer
Damn now this is content
How much despise I have for the Jungle kingdom is unreal. Ize is the cockiest person ever and overestimated their power. The same for sue but he wasn't as cocky. Starkiller was so joyful and would surrender if 1 person died. Ice & desert were nice since they got along, but jungle was so bad. I would have had a system where surrender if we need to, but attack when needed aswell. Nobody would hate us, and want to kill us.
The leader of the jungle is a bit selfish thats why they lost
The jungle team would have won if there leader was  better, yea he had good gear and he might of been good at pvp but he led his army poorly it was lowkey embarrassing for him to talk all that just to get clapped like a dweeb.
That comment about squid kid being 2nd best was hilarious
THIS SOUNDS SO FUN
Pls make more like this
Artic
Please make more civilization vids
And so, we learn, that no one likes an aggressor, if it is an oppressive dictator or a deceitful general, the irony is that stayin on your land all game was actually the winning strat, people need to learn to love each other, no matter what they had accomplished, it was a goal to win as a nation, not as a leading figure
SPOLIER DO NOT CLICK READ MORE IF YOU HAD NOT WATCH THE FULL VID        LOL the desert kingdom be like: wow this is fine. While the jungle was raiding the artic
Luvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
This entire video could be an absolute perfect series or film
Bruh jungle literally became a dictatorship
Do the jungle kingdom straight turn to Russia
The jungle group did a full eren Yeager on that election
It would be interesting if civilisations that are doing well in economy and food would be able to spawn in some new players. In that way it would not favored as much into fighting and building a military might!
Jungle lead by star
SQUID-KID i thought he dissapeared
“Is that all we are to you content?”  Me: “I am your god”
its an albion online in minecraft
This was so entertaining lmfao
jungle was going good so far untill ize became king it just started going down
“He’s talking over everyone and is repeating the same 6 things” *proceeds to do exactly that*
can u make this  Civilization mod in like a lord of the rings version or the hobbit version
watching this as a genshin player was entertaining to hear the music
Bro this Genshin soundtrack be vibin tho
This is honestly a great experiment (im only 49 seconds in and im super super interesting in whats going to happen)
Ok guys i am not doing this to get millions of comments or likes i want hear your guys opinion how would you rate the jungle king
Arctic build was nun 2 for me
Ngl i really wanted to see jungle being destroyed
The best was the artic there were so friendly together the worst was the jungle because all the time they get angry with the teammates
More Civilozations PLSSSLSLSS
25:07 he was killed by a phantom?
If jungle didn't get greedy and upgraded EVERYONES ARMOR AND WEAPONS woulda been gg
Jungle crew on that Russian shut bruv
Definitely do more of these. Invite Dream
Fully hated the jungle kingdom
Ize was a real one
Please do this again
please make a part 2 bro this was fr interesting
how could i participate in one of these?
dessert
Dude I freakin love this this is amazing truly great job man I love seeing how every group wanted to take different approaches and survival methods and like everything u have people that wanted to steal power just like real politics man this is great lived it dude keep up good work 💪💪😁
Everyone: “we need to work together!” Me: *Heading to a mountain to build a cottage:* _”NO.”_
Desert deserved the win
All i know jungle is just some russia people... IT HAS THE WORST PRES. Snow is basicly snowdin. (Sans intense flashback). And desert is normal region...
I like the desert kingdom
8:08 that one player is in every horror movie ever made I swear
Suep mad annoying tbh
Make more of these there supper cool and fun to watch I believe this type of content could get you more subscribers because I know it made me want to subscribe
Thx silver for saying 2nd best potato player
I like the desert kingdom most

Ize's fear of his people betraying him and therefore limiting their resources was his ultimate downfall
This video was structured well as it had conflict and a main antagonist. The viewer (you) probably hated on that jungle idiot and wanted him to lose so bad that you had to keep watching.
ize death was deserved
First time i got some insane recommendation by YouTube.. thanks youtube i found a amazingly good content creator 🤗🤗
The artic is like Indian people
Genshin fight music was used as bgm less goo
is a another of thes viedos
Is this a downloadable map?
Wow saitama dumb as hell for jumping of the statue and dying that's karma right their
i would have loved to play in something like this
yooo I would absolutely LOVE to be a part of something like this!
I really wanna play this map .anyone with any info on how to play?
Hmmm This Remind Of This Chilean Youtuber Who Did The Same Type Of Video But Some Weeks Ago hmmmm
Do more of these please
I loved desert
Wow another unoriginal probably botted minecraft account
21:54 I would have voted for the heckler
"we have to honor le monke"  Spoke like a true leader.
I like the ice kingdom
I would’ve loved being in the arctic nation ngl, it had a lot of sweet people
Man the jungle leader was a stalin
SQUID KID
Are you going to do this again?
bgm?
Poor starkiller
9:05
Noooo I wanted jungle to win
где все русские?
This was awsome, pls more of this
that jungle guy at 35:07  deserved it jajajajajaj
That jungle king reminds me of Danzo from naruto
What is the name of that server so i can jjoin next time and is it jarva
Why no bows
I wanna be part of something like this one day
this is so crazy to me that ize had a decent vision but was too blinded by ego
second best potato farmer in minecraft ouchhhhhh that must have hurt
Gg great vids love them so much
A kingdom led by force crumbles by force too! Ize ruled like a general instead of a leader, saying starkiller would've played defensively and died, is actually untrue! The desert won because they were unified and prepared, the artic was too passive, and the jungle was too warlike, the desert was a good mixture, they prepared for war but didn't want it, autocracy never works and will never work! Ize was extremely egotistical and tyrannical, and that's how his army got spread out and unorganized, UNITY MATTERS! 100 people with bows and spears but gorilla tactics and coordination could take out 200 people with guns but no unity or tactics and just rush in. Desert was playing chess while jungle was playing checkers, anyone who thinks ize style was good needs a reality check, PEOPLE ARENT ROBOTS, we have interests and feeling and needs, drafting them and forcing them to fight with low morale instead of unifying and encouraging them to fight is incredibly ignorant to how to rule/lead an army, ize was like hitler or Napoleon, AMAZING general shitty leader.
As much as they deserved it with how chaotic their structure was at first, I was routing for them as soon as they easily won the war against the arctic people.
Can you give seed
Confusing as to why it must be, I made, when it can just be a bunch of people. Very vain, inferring a complex, I'm sure of some kind. One many YouTube children tend to acquire. I suggest it's eventually worked out, or the ending I fear will always be the same.
My favourite was the jungle one
This is better than euphoria
Goosbump😳 omg nice story ize best king😳
During h the e sponsor I thought the boss was SUSANOO
Interesting! I'm assuming you were inspired by MagicGum
Artic was my favourite
How tf did the jungle win the building comp that was ass
The yt gods frown upon me
I liked the Desert kingdom the most.  The Jungle kingdom was practically cold-blooded and ruthless.  The Artic kingdom was completely untrustworthy and would take advantage of anyone if they had the chance  The Desert kingdom seemed to have the most morals, they minded their own business and only fought back when needed to do so.
Nice video,epic soooo epic
The fate of the entire civilizations lay in the hands of the Jungle civilization, whether or not they chose a militaristic view of the scape or a passive one. I wonder what would've happen if Star had prevailed in the end.
Bro the jungle king is mean
E P I C
You mortal has entertained me, you deserve to be subscribed
I loved the artic they were like all a happy family but they all died :'(
Make this a series please!
i have respect for the desert they have no trees the only thing they have to survive is a village jungle had it easy artic was 2 hardest
can we get a map download?
I had so many hopes for the ice King but 😥 😔
CELEBRATE! FOR! GENSHIN IMPACT!
I like the jungle king
why did I think of Avdol’s theme when the desert kingdom won
Wow your Channel grew fast tell me how you do it 😕😐
@Silver Yo! Love ur content! Its amazing! Keep up the wonderful work!
So suddenly skid kid shows up
More civ videos pls
😂 I like this guy 35:50
Midshin impact
this would be even more insane if it were on Conan Exiles
Not gonna talk abt hearts?
I'd have been a proud member of the desert kingdom. If I was part it that is.
The jungle king is right if they don’t fight they’ll be out geared
I absolutely hated the Jungle leader. He committed a cout d’etat and then wrestled control and killed his people in a senseless and needless war, instead of preparing his resources
Jungles king is horrible
2:20 they did squid kid dirty
I liked the Artic tribe
I liked Ize. His tactics or lack thereof was interesting, given that he brought his kingdom close to victory. Say what you want about the man but you have to give him credit for at least getting his kingdom pretty far without losing too many people for awhile.
that was fun thanks for that
The Mario music at the begging was nice.
At first I was like this is awesome, but then I saw 6:25 and was like “DAYUM” I would love to be part of this type of world lol. Just epic seeing players coming together to explore
As an unkown person once said.... "Will Power goes on even after death" The desert zombie is proof of that
ize had a point tho it’d be best to be the ones attacking than the ones waiting to be attacked they could have strategized better but he had a good idea
Why genshin impact
Jungle
Ize = the toxic man child desperate for others to see him as a person of worth when he really isn't.
I want that money give me 10,000 Bucks
I was Routing for the Dessert lands!!
I wanted arctic and then desert because arctic joined desert
I honestly can’t decide whether I like the fact that their zombie ended up being a total boss’s, or that jungle initiated the use of political assassination and got away with it
HOW DO YOU HAVE OVER 1mill SUBS WITH 30 VIDS
I rootes for jungle until they killed the star guy lul
Sign me up on the next one.
"Second best potato farmer" 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I know I'm a little late, but I swear... Since the first few seconds I was rooting for Jungle and Starkiller. No offense to Ize, but Starkiller would've been a much, much better king. He had patience and a better strategy. Then he was betrayed by unloyal teammates. I wish that he could've survived. Even if he failed and they lost, it would've been an honorable loss. I get that Ize took down most of Arctic, but using his power to control his team against their will was what led to his inevitable downfall. If only Suep didn't choose to team with Ize, he could've become victorious. This is my opinion, you are entitled to your own, so please, in the replies if there are any, don't argue...
Did you guys use kingdom two crown banners for the kingdoms?😂
30 minutes in, holy shit this Ize guy is annoying lmao
I had to learn more about los aztecas in my study, so I know about how they survived and thrived. So I will probably survive in that lands. Not desert nor Iceland will I survive in. The gods are going to be mad with these dudes by stealing. Ey! cabron give me back my treasure or else I'll ki-end your life.
Rip Ize a true dictator
Silver, please make a Minecraft civilization for Bedrock Edition!!
more vids like this please!
ize pissed me off
Yeaaa eyes sounds butthurt. He could've been the General
If I was in jungle I would get a group of people to kill the jungle king for star
Can I join?
A cool village idea would be like the plains faction who have a cavalry type war technique like the mongolians
Just like the real civilisation!
I’m sad for that jungle guy who wanted to join, he just got killed for no reason
jungle was awesome
bro the voice of chungledor was so cool and awesome lol like wow
The jungle king is kind of a brat I would’ve chosen the other guy
Ize kinda seems like a prick
More
Desert was def #1
A perfect analogy for the Jungle Kingdom is Nazi Germany. A militaristic leader who thought constant war was a way to lead a nation, and thus he destroyed the nation, because he confused being a general of a military with being a leader of a nation
Please do a sequel
This video was actually such a masterpiece.
What a dumb mistake of u when u gave a STACK of diamond ORE... Seems like it ruined the game. Did u not think fortune III will end up with insane amount of diamonds?? Also, I know that's an big issue, but, your server was lagging asf because of 100 of players running around.. The game experience is ruined too (especialy PVP/PVE...)  Editing was really good tho. 👍👍👍 There was damn good looking banners too
I have an idea, you can do 200 days in the nether as a shapeshifter with the same wizards from your other 200 days as a shapeshifter.
I think the jungle would win this if they werent so spread out in the 2nd phase of jungle-desert battle (desert regroups). There were essentialy 2 teams ( pvpin the deserts and one killing the town). If they would regroup on one of the hills sorrounding the town, desert would be forced to fight with more experienced players holding a higround.
this was bad ngl, giving advantages to the best civilization then trolling the worst so bad
I love how the strongman leadership style worked out similarly to how it would irl. The charismatic good natured guy gets instantly popular for his actual leadership, but the warrior takes control by force. As a result most people don’t like him and he doesn’t know how to lead, though he thinks he does, and it results in many issues with his rule.
Supreme
Dessert
The video is good and unique, But im pretty sure the thumbnail is practically copied from a different 100 players civilization.
Pedo impact
if you are to do a genshin ad at least know who raiden is...
pls go back to hypixel skyblock content :(

If star killer we still alive jungle would’ve won
Can you make another one of these and can I please join. I have always wanted to play in one of you servers and it would be amazing.
Bro I wanted the arctic to win
The real MVP here was the guy who spent so long bringing back the zombie.
U know whose the best potato farmer… I’ll give a clue: He is good at tnt run, good at parkour/pvp, also HE NEVER DIES!!!
It wasn't fare for this jungle team
This video sounds like the chinese when it split to a three kingdoms
I like you vid
I like your vid
nah that dwarven fortress is Erebor
100 kids try to simulate a civilization (in mc though, but shh). Idk why but the most American-sounding kids provide the most content, it's just pure cringe.
I liked the desert nation most and I hated the jungle nation because they seaked war
WHY UR MAIN CHANNEL IS DIED
Wow amazing painful join in game and preston
This is such an amazing idea make more of these!
The song always remind me fighting abyss mage in liyue and every time i almost died
Is there a limit of respawn?
jungle should have win lol
*I was rooting for the Arctic civilization, they had so much spirit, truly a sad loss when I saw all of them die after seeing them happily sing their holiday songs*
Man no more you spawm pillager again please Im dont want to watch die people
This is ur best video yet!
Yo thats just minecraft they Act like they Are irl
Shoulda let Starkiller stay king lol
I rooted for jungle and i think ize who is the jungle king is my favourite he lost in the end but he did amazing
I liked dessert and artic
Best part of this is the zombie being loyal even in death.
That escalated quickly
Pls make more videos like this its so fun
Was so happy to see that IZE clown get his booty cheeks clapped!!! 💪 🥊
Smart way to promote a sponsorship, I noticed the genshin background music
Seesh evil people in the jungle team
Rip star killer and the actual good jungle players    o7
I was rooting for desert from the beginning i'm glad they won
Solid Content broo! Watching from 🇵🇭🇵🇭
“Lead by the best potato farmer, sorry I read that wrong… second best potato farmer in the world” *laughs in technoblade*
when will u go back to skyblock???
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
i was hoping the jungle nation to win.
30:32 the jungle kingdom is Sparta times 10 lol
Awesome
Desert = Ukraine Jungle = Russia. Slava Ukraine
Ize was a great king
Okay okay dope dope
Lol u stole this I saw this on someone else's yt lol
I side with jungle and I feel like they should've won that I hated arctic and hated desert also Ize was the perfect leader as he was the most useful of all kings
I like your version of these more than others. Can we get more like this? Thanks much love
Jungle all the way bro
The drama in the jungle provided a few solid minutes of laughter for me and my sister 😂
Really enjoy this vid hoping for another vid or even series, cheers to you mate
Jungle was my favorite region but when ize became king I had no hope for them
I feel bad for star he spend his time to help his kingdom just to get assassinated
Even in death Abstrekt still serves!
Epic desert zombie warrior
I loved this video
I love the snow thing the one that I really hated was jungle team if it wasn't for eyes jungle I mean is it called starkiller was King they would have been better but I was just so cocky I hated him I was rooting for his downfall
Ngl I was happy Ize failed. Aside from being an overall asshole, he was a dictator, a horrible leader and a bad strategist.
Ize was supposed to be a talented aide to Starkiller who had the charisma to unite everyone. Instead he let his luck and expertise go to his ego.
The jungle kingdom had great military strategy but a divided populace. The arctic kingdom had  good military strategy and a populace that at least wasn’t out to kill each other.   But in the end, the desert kingdom with their desert power, was extremely united in a common purpose. Their overall military strength was only decent, but they had great tactical commanders and a solid society that prioritized the right things and shared resources between the rich and the poor.   Funny enough, this touches on real world concepts. If, like the JK, your nation is ruled by a tyrant, it will have some success militarily before succumbing to the weaknesses inherent in tyranny. If, like the AK, your nation has no internal strife but also doesn’t have unity and strong leadership, it will eventually succumb to the will of a tyrant. However, if your nation has competent selfless leaders and a populace dedicated to the betterment of all through the efforts of all, as well as a strong economy and a standing military, like the DK; then your nation will prosper and be able to survive exterior threats.   The even funnier thing, is that the majority of the world’s countries (including the 5 permanent members of the UN Security Council) still only fall into the JK and AK categories. The few countries that are in the DK category are well known, but I’ll give you some hints: - free universal healthcare  - free college education  - required 2yr military training for all citizens  - criminal justice system that actually reforms criminals - higher standards of living - extremely low poverty and crime rates - treats drug abuse as a sickness rather than a crime - creates some of the world’s best technologies
What happened to the other arctic players soup died so what about the other 2
The netherite guy was actually a good leader,he made sure they didnt get killed until the final fight, unlike starkiller who wouldnt get them as much gear and they would've been the first to die.
14:22 lmao, this was just sad
Them two guys arguing for king was jokes 😭
I liked Star Killer he was so nice and strategic with motivation to give
One of the best YouTube videos I've ever seen
IDC WHOS THE KING THAT ZOMBIE IS THE BEST WARRIOR
wow
this is actually a very compelling story, good job man!
If the last jungle member had brought it back that would have been sick as hell.  Completely lost for like an hour and then just comes in with shit tons of tnt and blows everything to hell
Desert
Man who kill the crew mate
hmm i think ize was better
You must make another one
Damn, arctic never seems to win in these simulations... o7
Cool
Awsome and Check This Video 4 Years Old Boy Playing Best - https://youtu.be/mdieHnB9VsU
Was definitely cool but the fact you can switch teams is kinda wack. Like obviously you're gonna win when you have double the forces.
man, i had to stop watching with this jungle bs. but hey, i guess thats what can happen in a civilization
the jungle king wasnt nice it was so clear that they get outnumbered the chemistry of the jungles was bad they should have stayed passive
Screw ize
Amazing vid
Make more of this please, It's very enjoying to watch <3
Rip squid kid only best by techno
So     freaking      cool!
The Antarctica sivilisation is kinda like canada
The genshin ost is good for the video
I hate the dessert they should go take the shower  I hoped the jungle won D:<
Jongle
2#m
Great video, great editing! The end with the zombie suddenly attacking seemed very fake tho
I cant wait for your next video
Jungle was definitly the best  They had a king, who can lead
Great idea!
I know imadately when forest and artic went to war desert well win because a figth well kill many giving a advantage to the desert army
We want more VIDEOS like this. AMAZING!!!!
I loved jungle, star killer was my favorite player
Hi!! pls dont remove my Comment im not a bot  im just helping my Brother
BRUH STOP ADVERTSING TRASH GAME ANIME
I dont own minecraft currently, but i wanna play
zombie is the MVP
"just kill 11 of them" "easy enough" *goes on youtube and plays Dream's theme 10 hour version*
I liked the artics they were peaceful
i liked the jungle team
Bruh I hate that Ize guy
Genshin Impact OST in the background really gives the vibe
Bro we want another
Have to say although it was sponsored the Genshin soundtrack fit the vid
Hated Ize from the jungle. Glad the desert won, they were smart and were preparing
Honestly Ize was kind of an idiot. He thought that since he was full diamond he should be a god even though he did nothing to try and lead people except bully them into submission, and he went into a 1v2 battle he couldn’t win
28:03 is that d day
The loot boxes are from this  video https://youtu.be/P9Fuu2z5PJ8
The jungle vs the artic, was ligit finlnad vs the soviet union
This is a banger!
29:34 Love those two, sound like they really care about each other's safety 😛  3:56 AM (yep!) 3/11/2022
War mongering is just not the way GOOD JOB TO THE DESSERT PEOPLE
Jungle: war loving thieves Snow: chill peace lovers Desert: absolute chads Suep: the embodiment of the saying 'to pull an italy' Ize: *angry noises*
This is literally world war 2 in a nutshell
PLEASEEEEE I WANT MOREE
Interesting story my fav was the jungle. This was a bit like the lion king
The guy from jungle that made the enchanting table was a real d*ck. Didn't like him at all, quite bigheaded.
This is not a social experiment... You're so arrogant.
can I join the civilization game?
I hate Ize cuz he is tyrant😤 at the first day he don’t care team work just find own power and after that use his power to control another player kill the real king and become tyrant king☹️😠
So like.. is silver supposed to be the god of this challenge?
I'm so glad the team i was routing for won
WE WANT MORE OF THIS!!!
I saw izee in another civilization videos and he was bare quiet LMAO
I love the genshin music playing in the backround
Ize was annoying af
I assume you play on PC because 100 players. Is it possible for a console player to join someone’s PC server? Cause I might be interested in joining one. I’d even give you the follow on Twitter of course. I’ll give you the like for the video though now.
Jungle nooo :( I wanted jungle to win
such a good video
Random lightning strike doesn't make any sense. Atleast make a thunderstorm event
how are you gonna put snow last… it’s the best one
That one dude who smacked and tanked the creeper in the jungle village pretty chad move ngl.
The jungle leader is so corrupt lol
The jungle leader is so corrupt lol
Ize was a terrible leader who only cared about himself. He was way too cocky and eventually it caught up to him which I am so happy about because he was so annoying. He did not care about his group or what happened to them he only cared about Power.
this videos thumbnail was copied by Magic gum
I liked the jungles monkey and they should’ve made King Kong 💀💀💀
This was well thought out
At least the person who died first was in the video 😂
I really like Ize, every good story needs the villain and he played his part perfectly
when speedsilver video
It should’ve been desert arctic jungle for the build competition
more
The kid who liked starkiller really deserved his death
This is literally the best thing I've seen out of Minecraft
2:23. Wow. Did squid kid dirty. Lmfao.
9:05 pedo group be like
GOD bless you all 🙏
Fishing in the desert ... yup
You whould also to 7 civilization video its would be more fun
The fact that Ize is Irish doesn't help in the department of "this isn't a shady back alley deal" sounding person.
You know, ize bring the half of this video
Ize > Starkiller
Is there a link where you can download the classes mod?
i personally believe ize was a good leader. you cannot run a civilization based off feelings. being hard creates the discipline that managed to conquer another civilization. ize had the power and courage to lead, but lacked strategy and communication. i agree on shedding out the weak minded players, but you need to give your strong components a voice. they pushed desert without any regroup or plan. there was a weak recon before engagement and that’s when it went to shit. obviously desert is aware the jungle is attacking. you need to understand that going full force without a plan will immediately get you killed.
Hated the jungle king
Lmao the jungle king sucked so bad
Say what you want about ize that Arctic invasion was pure perfection nearly wiped out the entirety of the Arctic Army without one casualty that’s amazing
JUNGLE,JUNGLE,JUNGLE,JUNGLE!!!!
Ngl feels like jungle got literally all the buffs for no reason
I like ad most the artic guys
Aww man i liked the jungle civilization, their leader was like me
Desert Kingdom all the way
This is why I love history
Man, I was really rooting for Starkiller. Mostly because of Force Unleashed
i really wanted the jungle to win
You ar badboy seliver
litteral blitzkrieg, and fashizm(almost) lol
the zombie still being loyal is so wholesome  try to change my mind
i always wanted to do this, but not with pre-set teams, just dump 100 players, and if some people die, invite new ones so that the population, and world events stay interesting
This video is sponsored by genshin impact
jungel
RIP starkiller he was soooo cool :(
RIP jungle :( i was sooo rooting for jungle they were sooo cool
The part were ize oofed just made me say geeettttttt dunnked ooonnnnn
The miner would be good for mining,the farmer could be good for food and warrior is for good pvp players!
"oh genshim impact hell yeah baby"
tf is wrong with ur voice
I would love to see something with slight more time to develop the server. Players building castles, defenses, redstone, etc. Maybe have a server, have the events spread out over calendar days and then set a date for PVP to be turned on. A week? A month? In the future
Ize's strategy almost worked, but he's the kind of person i wouldn't even talk to, even less play with. Also in a three factions game, the first two to fight give a big advantage to the third.
This is awsome!
I dont understand, why every tema didnt came up with the ides of building like defensives? wasnt it obvius that sometimes a group would attack? xD i think would Starkiller be the King and wouldve stayed on his island, they could gather more ressources and enough defensives to win this
I hope you get a better server soon so people don't die due to lag
this series is soooo good please make more
thats what minecraft really needs tbh.
Sheraz?
Can I join these wars?
is there any servers that do something like this? this would be really fun to just be able to do freely with random people
there should be more videos like this!!!!
yo that trixybloxs build
Big respect to the guy at 5:00 who sacrificed himself to save his teammates from that creeper
More video like this yes 💀
It started getting harder to watch after Ize became king of the jungle nation, that guy was a total douche and the fact there was ONE guy pointing out how he acted got me kinda pissed.
I like to see video like this
I hoped jungle would win, they were really good
How do I play Civ minecraft, I'm tryna get in on this.
Ngl one of the best minecraft videos I've seen. Here's to a part 2 or even a series
This was awesome! Definitely repeat!!!!! Matter affect I volunteer as tribute that seems like it would have been a lot of fun!!!!
Yeah I despised Ize. He is the literal epitome of the person who has no friends in real life so they act tough online.  I'm glad he lost and got his comeuppance. Deserved it.
SO glad Jungle lost hard.
That's what called Quality content we've been waiting to watch!
U got 1 million in 2 years I like this and shapeshifter continue what ur doing!
Ize is just a genuine villain. Like that wasn't even roleplay or anything
Make more of this pls
my boy gaslighted his way into king
Why was Ize a movie villain?
Part 2 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Attic all the way
응애 나 아기야붕이
4:59 aint no way we're breezing over how this dude OUT OF THE WAY MR PRESIDENT'd that creeper. what a champ
Jungle sounded like the trump vs biden during election lmfao
genshin impact is a shit game, prove me otherwise
Jungle king turned into a dictator xd
Bro make more I swear I’ll subscribe if I see another one
Whooo desert!
man i feel like ize thought he was the good guy through all of this but damn. how can some one be such a villain with out knowing they are the bad guy. the whole time i was routing for him to die horribly
what is the song thats plays at 10:25 ?
Ik robbiemcfly, the guy who killed star killer. Myself and him played on a server called mine club together lmao
I hoped artic would win
You know what’s sad? Not one person realize d that the goal was to “survive” not “win”. They all coulda potentially “won”  . Maybe Star’s more passive tactics woulda led him to communicate with the super passive arctic, forming an alliance that woulda forced the desert to either join up, leave them alone or face death.
I hate this video it's always in my recommended
40:35 that's what actually happended to the Mayan Civilization
3:57 ad skip
L video
Ize was such a asshole I was so glad when he died
Yess i love this please make more
35 minutes in and i hate everyone except desert
Gamer’s commitment here
It's not like star killer couldn't get diamond armor
I feel bad for the arctic kingdom
Rip star
Bad timing bozo
is anyone else here an og who has been with Silver from week 1 cause i have and his content never been dissapointed :D
I really didn't like the jungle team because of the king. I really liked the Arctic.
Part 2
Amazing video man
ize a real mf
I liked and subscribed. If you make more of these, I will 100% watch every single one of them.
At first i was team jungle but i didn't like their king. Slowly but surely i switched side to desert.
Guys what is the fighting music he used
Fav builds #1: Arctic builds #2: Jungle builds #3: Desert builds  Fav civilisation #1: Jungle #2: Arctic #3: Desert
We need your skyblock content back - - - - - - SPEEDsilver:)
pls post the next 100 days
Desert Nation
I liked the artic
this deserves to go viral. ITS AWSOME!
i was rooting for jungle at first but after starkiller got thrown in the trash i started supporting artic and desert cause of how good their comunity was
the moment you said you said you were rooting for the jungle kingdom was the  moment I clicked the dislike button, starkiller was the rightful leader.
I was actually rooting for dessert the moment I saw the zombie-
Nice video! it would be even better with some shader to make it look better
"So lead by the best potato farmer. Wait I read that wrong. Second best potato farmer in Minecraft." LMAO
Second best
can i join in server with tlauncher btw i sub you
#ustoleavideo
Ize was the Putin of Minecraft. Rip star 07
Epic.  “Have you- Have you ever heard of Genshin Impact?”
35:50 Comedy king
2:25 didn't have to do squid kid like that
This was soo far better than justice league
35:50 “and you guys killed none of them... GOSH”
do more of this that was cool
This was sooo good plz do more
ize was just  a straight up dictator
I want muuuuuuch more of this
jungle is like russia. arctic is like philippines. desert is like u.s
If you're going to make other one make like overwold vs nether vs end city see who we'll win and kinda fit on your 100 days first 100 days is on overwold next is on the End next is on the nether it's going to be fun to see
stop hating on ize, this is just a game. plus, he made it much more interesting.
ize is the type of guy to punch someone and say "he punched my knuckle with his face", like bro his character was so put together that i despices him the whole time lol
The king of jg is so anoying
How did the jungle win? They didn't have one percent of what others groups had
Lalya273 i like 200 plz plz plz
The blackstone pyramid at 40:27 is real, it was made my TrixyBlox and he has a whole video building it
best server it gives me WoW felling from chosing your Class xD
Imagine playing Minecraft.. And dying from a creeper.. Have you played Minecraft on creative mode for too long then?
How do you get in 100 days
How me and my friends can do this. We want to play like this
I love how you could apply the balance of power theory to this. In international relations, conflict may happen when one group has an advantage and the other is bound to catch up. This game seriously went sentence per sentence when you read the Wikipedia article about balance of power (international relations).
That was epic. But i wanted the jungle kingdom to win though. Still epic.
idk ize seems very sus and egoistic to me
This is actually the best this style of video I have seen till date very cool
i really like the artic. I hope they can find more diemon and netherrie to uppgrad their gear but they are so weak
WRONG NAME.  7:22
I fell like arctic was the most united
Jungle King has such an ego leading to L. StarKiller if he was a king would change an L to an W.
This is just a more complicated walls
bro, this got me 40 minutes hyping the shit, just imagine making one server of 1000 people, that would be rad af
6:49 They got colonized
Ize is so pressed.
Ize literally the worst king since Joffrey Baratheon.
This felt like a proper story. Best one yet. Please mkae them longer. Even two parters. i would watch an hour and a half of this easily.
Love it!
why is it that the jungle teams player named Eyes or somethin, the one made king. was reminding me so much of Putin
"and you guys killed none of them... Gosh
I liked Jungle up until they killed Starkiller.
I was playing genshin while watching this and thought I accidentally started a battle when the music was playing in the video :O
ngl i was hoping the jungle would win
Yall have to realize that ize made this video 10x more entertaining, He was the villain. Hate him or not, he made the story cooler
The jungle kingdom was a perfect example of how dictatorships are started and held
"Have you ever heard of Genshin Impact?" _-900 emotional damage_
Definitely wanna see a sequel this was awesome
I like desert i thinkAmun ra is there
Jungles story really reminded me of animal farm. At least how ize came into power.
Feels Like rise of kingdoms
I like the artic kingdom they were very jolly
I love how you use Genshin Impact musics 💚
I enjoyed watching Ize fall.
Nah nah cuz ize was an ass leader. He didnt even try to be nice. He was a dictator. Star killer would probably have built democracy and build votes. EVEN AFTER IZE WAS CHOSEN HIS TEAMMATES DECIDED TO KILL STAR LIKE BRUH.
This is the best
im clicking the subscirbe button, we need more of this series
Hearing the mario theme from super mario bro bring me memories
this video is gold fr
I love it you deserve my sub now give us the PART 2!!!! 🔪🔪🔪🔪
This is just a remake of what another YouTuber did so you could get some views (Probably because the YouTuber got successful over they're video)
Where are you from and why u pronounce everything with your tongue rolling
tecno fans when he said secind best 👁️👅👁️
The greatest leader is the one who dosen't seek out to be one
The desert because they were pacifist but very smart also I want more of this
my favorites were jungle for sure
I honestly thought the jungle build was the worst, like I could have easily built that.
Lmao 22:54 failed assassination 😭😭😂😂😂
can you make it again but with guns pls
he really did squid kid like that at the start
Ize is really getting on my nerves ngl goodthing they lost
We need another video like this till we have the 3 best go against each other
"Guys don't be persuaded he just has an accent" He has a point there
Why is No one talking about Seup. I was rooting for him because he seemed so badass but in the end he backstabbed the desert for the victory of his arctic nation
Please do another one. U do it so much better than everyone else
Loved the jungles when star killer was alive hated them loved and felt bad fie the arctic's and desserts now I love them both or the the desserts since the arctic's joined the desserts
10/10 video. I need more of these
That idiot who tried to betray Ize, got killed, and alerted the desert of their intentions really threw the invasion lol
Jungle was the best lokey  Sadly they lost 😞
My favorite was the arctic. Though they were the weakest, they were a calm group of people singing nightingale and other lullabies under their tree. I am a new subscriber, but hope to be in one of your future projekts 👌🏻
My favorite since the beginning was the jungle
silver i  want to be in a civalisation video
Starkiller would have been a way better leader
I need more of this
"Not saying anything we don't already know!" pretty much every person going up for election. It's not kamikaze it's more last man standing.
this guy liked his own comment and no one else's lol
JUST SAY YES!!!
Like do you need some rest?
Do you need a break from making videos?
The jungle kingdom had a massive advantage and they still lost due to poor leadership and inward fighting
Looks like suep should have been king haha
I miss the ice kingdome
Jungle king is trash
Dessert is have a great comeback
Please do more hypixel skyblock vids, I miss speedsilver
Jungle had the best chances but their King Sucked
This is a perfect video to show in history class for how Hitler took power just do what the jungle king did
hi
i was rooting for jungle till that ize guy and the death of starkiller . ize gave me the same vibe as dio from jojo i hated him with my whole being
Yess the desert won
I liked jungle before Ize came to power.
it was mind blowing
PLSSSSS DO MORE LIKE THIS
still kinda dumbfounded that they didn't build in cannons in the dwarven fortress, and rig traps
Jungle got what they deserved 🤣
How do you create a server
I was rooting for artic, but then decided to root for desert instead cause- well, artic was hopeless since they got ambushed first.
You should do the same thing but with inspiration from lord of the rings
That was a funny moment when that guy said "oh genishen impact oh yeah baby" 🤣🤣
5:00 mans took one for the team
IM A OG
Jungle king was toxic, but most fun to watch
I think I would join the jungelarmy
Subscribe to CookieNinja 🍪 Subscribe to CookieNinja 🍪 Call Of Duty Warzone!!
The Jungle kingdom's leader was as determined as hitler when he became the dictator and tried gaining back all the losses of ww1. But, both Hitler and the desert kingdom's leader met the same tragic end... But a salute for the determination though!
So happy that little rat from the jungle died
Im glad i watched this, really enjoyed watching this. Love the drama and story. Definitely gonna subscribe.    14:19 is really hilarious
I love ize
As a Genshin Impact gamer, I appreciate you using some of the game’s OST’s in this video.
Lets be honest we all enjoy silvers mc content
Mans violated squid kid
I would like to join one when I receive my account in the future. So please do events like this in future 😇
It reminded me of game of thrones
coolest video ever!!
Ize is a god
Brain dead Jungle King. I respect wanting to War but at least be smart about it smh. No logistics whatsoever.
"And u killed nun of them, gosh"🤣🤣🤣
Loved the idea, and would love to see a few more
This is also very teaching, you can't take all down in one hit, you must slowly make better stuff
Lets just appreciate what squid kid did for the  team , his potato farming skills came handy !
I like the video and subscribe it and I love the Arctic region
that was dope man, liked it a lot, all civilizations roleplayed really well
This type of vids i still enjoy lmao
I'm very upset about the artic population dying, they were the most positive in all 3 civilization, what will happened to the tree now
Damn that ize guy was so sweaty to fight pvp lol he must be a war nerd.
Im with ize on this one
And did u have this server open for us to play it sounds really interesting to me
2:55 !WARNING! DISCORD MODS INCOMING
who ever planned all of this, this was brilliant
Ize was too much of a cocky leader. Guy wanted to be a highlight of the video.
It would actually be better after they attacked the arctic, they should've paused, strategized, and re-geared because the desert is clueless. They would've actually pulled this off but they became maniacs lmao..
I want StaKiller to be revived and hunt down the old king who I'll call the king of war. =) give the man his revenge.
2:22 techno be like what did u said
I liked Jungle the best
That jungle King got the might but no brains. Ruling with fear is one thing, but if that fear is not rooted at admiration, all he has are nothing but the fragile loyalty of his men. TLDR: He ought to work on his speech skill. The logic was there to back him up as a king, but he was too stupid to think that the people would just listen to him. I don't like Starkiller too, he let his people have too much freedom. Charisma can only take you so far as does might. You need all to lead. Basically the militaristic Jungle Nation need a complete leader, because without a complete leader, a militaristic nation is nothing but a house of cards.
This is by far his best video
god i would so be down for this on a friday
Hi silver. I have really enjoyed all of your videos allot
this gives me rise of kingdoms vibes
That jungle king if he had real world power would be just like Putin of any other dictator
I liked the jungle civilization
If I were part of the Jungle Faction, I'll leave and join the Desert instead
I honesty like desert guy because of of that zombie thing dude it was so much funny
Can you please make more video like this one plsss i beg youuuuuuuu
Imagine if the dead guy was actually spectating when his zombie won the war
Please make another one of these. But you need to make sure the primary figures of this server such as Ize are not included in the next server to ensure a whole new experience.
The Jungle Tribe is literally the perfect embodiment of the novel, Lord of the Flies. A civilization in the jungle turned from democracy to a militaristic rule with the collapse of an idealistic leader and his subsequent death. In the end, democracy failed to prevail amidst the violent sentiment and those who turned to the militaristic approach saw a similar fate, with their society eventually crumbling as well.
“IZE” turned the jungle from the fan favorites to the villains 😂😂😂 your literally playing Minecraft man chill out
the “IZE” guy was such a bozo he was so annoying 😂😂😂
I’m so glad that jungle traitor died my leader hurt my feelings but the rest of my people are flourishing but he’s “cocky” like buddy if I was surrounded by people as dumb as that kid I’d probably feel pretty cocky too get outah here
I'm so happy that the Jungle ended up losing, Ize was pure evil
that was epic👍
mad respect for donkey kong country returns music at 18:40
"Oh Gensin Impact? Hell yea Baby!
The mystery playuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Whoooo knowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwws
Part 2 please
why no skyblock
Cant help but respect eyes I mean he overthrew his king, used medieval fear tactics to keep his people loyal, and had a reign of terror
Man, starkiller was SO annoying. There’s positive reinforcement and then there’s overdoing it and doing too much
I really hope that ize is never someone’s boss one day. Dude can’t handle power clearly
the jungle kingdom feels like russia
That zombified person was broken bruh
Second best potato farmer had me dying
Bring starkiller back. I want to see him lead a nation
If I was a leader of any of the three, I would order everyone to dig bunkers and make high walls made of some good material and have torches everywhere to stop mob spawns and make sure that we wouldn’t never go and attack any other civilizations ourselves.
rip to the winter
new idea 100 players but its zombie infection mode idk if it will work
I like how sliver is the strongest player
I'm not a minecraft player, but damn this vid made me engaged. hopefully there's a plan for a series out of this please.
ize was a good leader in my eyes, if star was the leader all he wouldve done was stay in the jungle with bad gear and eventually get beat by the other nations, at least here ize had a heroic end and wasnt afraid to go down fighting
Ize is Putin in disguise.
my favirte is the jungle
I really was rooting for Arctic because of their charisma but the jungle ruined it
Jungle
jugle
tbh i was rooting for jungle too lol
That stupid leader killed them so suck it
if Technoblade would be in the video it would be so much fun with im_a_squid_kid unfortunately techno is not in it
This Was Amazing!!! I'd Love To See Another One!
I was praying that the artic team wouldve won but it is what it is cant win them all
hutao my wife
You should do this but with 4 biomes and 200 players
I love that he use genshin impact music for tencion
i kinda agree with whoever mentioned starkiller woulda been chilling as the king if he was still alive, the jungle civ coulda still been eating carrots :((
I like how the jungle team had an amazing rise and fall
IM PULLING RAIDEN IM USING MONEY
If Ize wasn’t trying to bring star killer down so he would for sure win the crown they would’ve made a great duo if one got the crown and the other was second in command I think they could’ve won Ize was strong and star killer was good with the people it would’ve made the jungle kingdom more willing and more secure
Ize is annoying. Kinda guy that should play rust. Always blames others for plans failing despite him creating the plan
Screw the jungle
Analysis: Ize is a bitch
FUCK IZE damn dictator had nothing to offer except Armor and a promise of victory I would have trusted Starkiller
I WANTED THE JUNGLE TO WIN. Bittersweet ending for me folks
First I have to admit that the video came out very well. secondly I have to congratulate you even more, because you managed to make me watch a video of Minecraft after so many years that i used to saw these kind of video. in conclusion I hope you will bring other videos similar to this. Congratulations on the excellent work.
AT 20 MUNITSE IN THE VOTE FOR THE DROPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TGE OTHERWAY ROUND
The people who picked warriors and turned to flee in battle when their kingdom was at risk are no warriors, a true master of war would die for they’re region and would never surrender unless ordered so by their ruler which even then would dishonour them greatly. Hence the people that had lower gear but killed the stronger followed this rule, improving their skill in combat and to study their enemies within seconds of battle to find the most successful finish upon their opponent with such speed to aid the lesser. As a warrior I honour those that ran back to face death for their region and did not worry of the consequences knowing they have done their part in this war
Ignorance, arrogance, and sweat. Truly the best combination for an insufferable person, Ize. RIP BOZO 🤣😂🤣
Why did jungle lose?!?!?!?
When I finally noticed the Genshin Impact soundtrack 👁👄👁
Here's tips for better videos: Enable animals spawning Use mods
Make a part 2
I aint gonna lie, I really did not like starkiller, Too me it just seemed like he almost became king cuz he kissed alot ass
My fav was jungle they had epic farm Sad that the duck assinated the king who should be chosen
Bro said Jim jones 💀💀
This video is bad cuz star didn’t win the vote
This video is truly amazing! And the editinggg bruh 🔥
Maybe the zombified abstrekt wanted revenge against the jungle king for invading his people and his homeland
Can I be in a lot of videos I love them
Before even watching I was wondering how you get an even split of 100 players 3 ways?
Jungle be like: Blitzkrieg!
Ize, Crazed with power, lost his team
Genshin impact..YAAAASS
I was actually rooting for jungle, i like his thinking
this would be incredibly cool as a server
Ize managing to epitomise almost everything I dislike in an every-day person.
So pretty much jungle was russia, ice was ukraine, and dessert was the rest of the world. so were only at the part where ukraine is being depleted. also ize is a near embodiment of putin
Where can I play this?
This was dope good video
Soup lead them well
Rip star killer bro
I liked arctic the most, sucks how they died
Second part and count me in.
Is nobody gonna talk about the Mario music in the background😂🤣
I was kinda hoping the jungle kingdom would have won
is anyone gonna talk about the 3 innocent players killed for content?
was rooting for jungle, I wanted Ize to win
the arctic cilvilisation seemed so nice ;(
I loved this video!
Star was a CHAMPION. Ize just wanted the power, but Star wanted to lead everyone to victory by beautiful teamwork, I hope Ize admitted that he can't rule everything just because he wants and became a better person, Star, if by some random luck chance or something you're reading this right now, You deserved to be the king man.
abstrekt is a legend
If star is the lider of jungle they would win star is friendly so my fav character is star and gav cil is desert
ooooooooo 2:21
I'm sensing lore somehow
Ize is one really weird dude. It's as if he's been waiting his entire life to be the dictator of a handful of people, and as soon as someone was advising to not go he leaves his entire group to go kill one person? So strange. Curious what happened to that guy in his childhood.
You should do like a BIGGER CIVILIZATION. For example, if one kingdom wins, you should let them become a deserters And let them create new kingdoms. That'd be fun
Lol, It's like I'm watching a minecraft movie.
The ice kingdom
Abstrekt: even in death I serve
woah this was sick
And that music from genshin
Ize is a great example of "pride before the fall"
35:53   *gosh*
Ngl, Ize made good points and he sounded really smart well battlewise, but if he befriended Starkiller and had him lead the other faction instead of having him assassinated, he needed an advisor as a 2nd in command as his right hand, Saitama wasn't up to it as he tried to rule over like him and just like how he died the Jungle kingdom fell.
This content's so good. I've always loved midieval age thingies but don't have a proper pc. Sadly.
This was great! thanks for uploading
Love the video but the jungle king I actualy hate him
I dont like the jungle king because hes like a toxic kid
What's this mode called I am trying to look for it and can not find it
Just kidding 😂😂😂
🤣🤣 his leader is so rude and selfish and bad guy
I hate jungle team
jungle was the best but lost i liked it because they were the first one to fight like me
Dude, the jungle nation reminds me of a book called "Lord of Flies", its scary how a book about savagery can represent actual people.
the fact that you out genshin music during the video is incredible! U actually took the sponsorship very seriously
jungleee
Jungle is corruption and greed every good tale needs a bad guy
poor for Arctic Team... they got a RAID from Ravager XD
We need more videos like this PEASE!! I loved this too much
For some reason, I was rooting for the jungle kingdome lol. Shit reminded me of Stalin(Ize) and Trosky(Stasrkiller)
I was rooting for the dessert civilization from the start as even I also live in a desert state Rajasthan , I didn't thought that we will win but i  got very happy that we win
The full diamond guy is such an annoying person, holy shit. Especially when he follows the guy making a good point about leadership
This was very entertaining and my first video of this guy  It would be a crime not to sub
The jungle leader literally did an Animal Farm on them( it's a book). Bullied his way into power then got rid of their competition and saying it was a bug.   I am so happy jungle did not win. Guy was an actual bully.
Jungle really pulled some moves from Russia's book
Seup had a full Fire Emblem protag story going on.
Desert civilization 🙂
The jungle players should’ve won this tbh
the moral for the Artic kingdom:is to get better armor and weapon the moral for the jungle kingdom:that being strong mean noting when your cocky and the desert kingdom:is that be friends  everone stay together
Jungle Kingdom got the right king for entertainment reasons. He was just such a good villain for the story.
Imagine playing genshin impact
(Dislike)
This was by far the most entertaining minecraft video I've seen.
I enjoy this video
I beg you do another one of these
What's the IP of server 😔❤️❤️❤️
IZE is so lame
F**k the person that killed star killer
This is a masterpiece bro
where can I join this next time
I hope the jungle civ gets theirs
Me og
I liked the Arctic kingdom and am sad that they lost first.
Elytra was too op
The sus was amazing
This was a great video tbh
I love how the artic players never gave up.
Iv ALWAYS wanted to see what would happen if this was a legit thing that happened sence I was 8 so it's crazy to see this video years later
Here for the algorithm
Thanks for the code
It be cool to see more
Was really going for jungle to win rip
Please part 2
Why y'all hating on Ize? That's my kind of leader
Arctics had the spirit! I wanted them to win from the very beginning.
Politics but in Minecraft and with natives
Im more invested in this video than most shows XD
Plagiarism is a funny thing
What if we make this again but goal is to trade the most items?
Am I the only one that noticed the Super Mario Wii, World 2: Desert music in the background?
the jg guy is so annoyng
You can hate on the Jungle King but he really give us really good content
I like how people continuously trolled their other members
Ize was like a dictator and ruled with an iron thumb. He was very cocky in thinking gear would carry him to victory. He should've waited a little and formed a strategy agasint the desert kingdom. I totally agree with his plan of attacking the arctic kingdom though
I love of he remembered that I’m a squid kid is the second best potato farmer
Jungle actually had a super functional army there for a minute
Genshin Impact is gross.
Ize was such a sweaty dick I was rooting for anyone but him. Arctic seemed like the most fun but Desert seemed the most united for sure. Just glad Jungle got kicked down where they belong. Wish they'd all have just ganked Ize when he was alone.
i love the editing
Jungle is better
i liked jungle they were going for the w
I mean, the starkiller guy was a cringey kiss ass. Easily the most unlikable person in the entire thing
This is the best reality show I have ever seen.
Bro I hated the jungle king
rip
the liyue battle theme actually fit the video well
All this in a nutshell: Kill the jungles
I read the title as race war instead of peace war
insane video deserves more
A bad King always fall hardest
The mario music was a bop
It really isn't fun if they just go into a crusade
Kinda bummed that Jungle didn’t beat everyone lol
Why’d he say “he was wiped out”, when it was only one dude?🤣
I liked the article town the most
I like the jungle at first until the king that was in charge was bloodthirsty, if he had focused on improving his army and actually strategizing his attacks before attacking, he could've won
LOL SQUID KID
dude the jungke king should've just spent time on gearing up his army instead of blindy invading the artic
Yeah, I'd rock with the desert kingdom.
this video is basically our world's history
Desert
I was against Ize from the start ngl
YO lol i just realised thats issac haha bro memories privatefearlesss!! man
pls do another vid like this so good
Do smth like this in vintage story. 100% better
Ize made this whole video a snore... just another Civ video with "wE mUSt Go tO WaR". Boring, be original
the creeper that killed a player in the start of the video looks a bit weird... the player went to the creeper and just stood there, yeah that's the first sign that i see that this could be staged
love the genshin music in the backround
Haha whaat theres so many known youtubers that i used to watch in this video thats crazy
I love these vids man.
nice editing
My favorite group was ice because they had such a high moral and lovely town(and jungle because they had a corrupt king)
love the content 9/10 desert looked really fun
No way a genshin impact ad
I was hoping for desert to win so epic
Desert and arctic earned my favourite
please give me this mod for  the border seperation
HOW can I play this???
the ice one
The Black Book Will Rise Corruption Will Come To An End
i would wanna be in something like this
hi speed silver
Respekt to the Jungle Team wich fighted the Most and the best in my opinion
damn you didn’t have to do squid kid like that lmao
DESERT
We need a sequel
Jungle only after they crowned a king
Bruh I just realized that genshin impact soundtracks were playing in the background throughout the video
Waiting for more civilization videos⏲️
survar
Its amazing how these experiments mimic real life charasmatic jungle leader lookinf for peace and prosperity gets dethroned by militaristic authoritranian dictator
best minecraft vid
Jungle kind of deserved to lose after letting someone like Ize even live after seeing him for the first time in full Dimond gear. I've was just a bad community member and didn't contribute to any of the progress. Gear doesn't determine leaders
This was a full blown movie, we had backstabs villains heroes everything you needed
Ngl the leader for the jungle wasn’t a king,but a dictator,an evil brutal dictator
The jungle king is like the guy your friends hang around with so you do too but hes a total ass and you really hate hanging out with him
Artic.You rreally put artics in unfair situation many times
the jungle king was a douche they would of been fine if they didn't attack them
Do more of these
Please do more of this!!! It was amazing
21:24  I’m dying at the guy saying ‘you’re sick’ XD
My favourit civilation was ice ):
This is a great video Love it ❤️ the jungle king and putin are exactly the same person much lovee cant wait for another vid
Ngl the desert people were giga chads from the very beginning and the jungle people were annoying
do you know what this client is?
ize like hitler lol
Lets gooo desert!
Walter
This video was so intresting
"I am going to elect myself king!" "Uhm, no."  Cha cha, smooth.
I Really wanted the jungle kingdom to win ngl.
Jungle
LOL that jungle king wannabe is hella cringe, you know one of those people in a movie who's super annoying and endup dying, thats him
The jungle kingdom should of based near and rain arrows on weak memebrs of the desert kingdom. then flank from the sides as the enemy travels towards the base on the mountain.
Izy's tactics were good, but he is too impulsive and cocky to eventually lead their nation to end
Bruh i literally thought my Genshin was on in the background because of the sudden fighting theme on 6:19 HAHAHAHA
The jungle was the best
Your voice is pissing me off but video is too interesting to turn it off
no way my guy was playing earthbound music at 10:22
Is there any possibility you could make this like a minigame on a server? I would pay to play something like this
That is actually pretty cool like just chilling and then you can like start war and get peoples building etc holy shit well done man!
ROK in minecraft?
Dessert
Sarrr vaarrr
Can you do a 100 person civilization in bedrock/ is there anybody that does that ?
I really thought jungle was going to win
Your voice sounds like you’re such a very chill guy!
jungle gang
I really liked the desert civilization
Genshin Impact music in a Minecraft video sound amazing
Jungle better desert lucky
Disliking for the troll chest of a ravager and pufferfish.
ize sucks
Jungle should have gone back to regroup and stack up on supplies before charging desert like a headless chicken
The jungle was the best do another one of these
Blatantly stealing peoples thumbnails, ideas and exact events.
i love how he used genshin music
i appreciate this kind of videos, is kinda watch got, but in minecraft xdd. very  entertaining brah
Ize is the prime example for a bad leader
I don't like how these are designed to cause war based on their starting region. I feel like it would be more interesting to see how players develop in one civilization with many more players to fill in niches. And seeing a civil war can help entertainment value because it makes the war much more personal
Thought was funny that video was sponsored by genshin impact cause my big sister plays the game
I'm 6 minutes in to this and very upset there's only 40 minutes of footage! This is a fantastically fun idea! An assassin in the jungle camp?!?! Accidental deaths, starvation, some guy just sacrificed himself to a creeper to save the others!!! And watching their different approaches to getting food fast is so interesting. I wish this was a series I could binge!  This video appeared at random in my YouTube feed but I'm definitely subscribing 😍  27 mins in... Watching that troll strong arm his way to the throne only to instantly prove how he could not be a worse leader was just pure bliss! It's such a shame a few of the group ruined what could have been the best team by far. Their kingdom was stunning, that farm was epic, all they needed was a good leader and a dead troll. This is my new favourite show 🤣
Why did suep betray....  or did he lead the ize to a cave to be trapped
I liked jungle until Ize came along...
bro i liked the jungle civil the king was the total killer i'd join him and be his right ha nd  \
I’d never be friends with Ize:)
i feel so bad for all the guys saying ohw no when dying it breaks my heart. to die in heartcore
1:32  Those 3 is literally useful
Does anyone know a plugin server that can replicate this class logic of selecting between being a farmer, miner or warrior? this would be really userful when playing multiplayer survival in minecraft in general.
Bruh i play genhin fo1 year
The irish king guy is so annoying, can't he just stfu🤣
i was actually rooting for desert but i thought they would lose against jungle i’m happy they actually won
LMAO THe guy who said "Um, no" Had me weak  XD
I'm sorry but if I was there  I would've builds second civilization underground because I could so I would be doing my own thing while this was all happening and then after I was done I would reveal it to everyone in my team as a back up base or something like that But still have some stuff hidden for myself
Jungle was the best!
Therapist: 6x3 chest isn't real, it can't hurt you.  6x3 chest: 7:45
Vân tay
Damn that was too good do more civilization videos
Halfway in and I'm really rooting for the Arctic team. I love all of them.  Edit: Damn. I really just watched you drop a ravager on them. You monster D:
Imagine if techno was in one of these like he would EASILY gain king and just fucking slaughter
Genshin as sponsor?? Wow I’m impressed
You stole a thumbnail
well that was very fun to watch but jungle had a lot of advantages. you shoud've included ravaged in theirs XD
I like the jungle kingdom, they really does the right thing, farm, build a guild, and what I really like is their king who convinced those members who don't want to go with them
The drama in the jungles government is impeccable
Desert start from far ant then win i like the desert the most artic second and jungle third because their king is a bad king
ize is the goat he saved his nation like a boss
ize makes me so mad
this series is so good
Lol squidkid knows how to make potatoes
is it me or do American minecraft YouTube radio like killing natives
Bruh pls make more of this I prefer this vid wayyyyyyyyyyyy more than other 100 player form a civilization in Minecraft
Make this content 99999999 times ending should be like this, but different missions.
20:18
I like how you actually used music from Genshin, since they are the sponsor
Desert
jungle  gang
i like how you used Genshin Music, Nice!
wibu
this was incredible
I hated the jungle king
the best
I really want to be in a vid
"squidkid"   Techno fans: 😶
Ize is so toxic and selfish omg i forst rooted for jungle but when he was king i rooted for artic but they gor wiped  out
Jungle ftw
Damn, I was rooting for Jungle.
I just noticed you're using Genshin Impact's background music around 6:26, dayum
So Ize is the person that likes to make the game not fun....   good to know!
I didn’t like the king of jungle he was a to much cocky
i hate the jungle king, he was so toxic
Isaac is a unique character for these videos, as he doesn't have to act or be dramatic like others do. His personality is so awful he creates drama without even trying.
it's so good that even I don't play minecraft anymore I still watched the whole vid! I'm lovin' this kind of content ❤️
The king of the jungle civilization was over confident and he was trying to show that he is the best but actually he was a mad.
"have u ever heard of genshin impact?"  - The last survivor of jungle kingdom
Subscribe lol episodes channel
silver2022: *roasts squid*
We need moooooooorrrrrreeeeeeeee
Pls make more. It’s very good
yes, cursed the jungle nation and its immature non-leadership king!!
2:18 the potato war joke tho
Jungle is the best
Used genshin themes all throughout the video. Tbh they kinda fit.
I felt so bad when Arctic got Destroyed! They we're so nice :(
Let’s go was desert whole time
Ize was way too arrogant and self-centred to be leader. Even though he said he wanted to be King to help them win, in reality he wanted to be king for himself. It's easy to see; he abandoned the group right from the start in order to get better gear for HIMSELF, and then refused to share anything, even the enchanting table which giving to them in no way harmed himself, until he realised it would help his bid for leadership. Then instead of trying to help them do anything like gather food or other resources, he dragged them into what would've been a civil war if STARKILLER hadn't been the one to step down - which, ironically, marked him as the superior leader as he thought of the Jungle Team above himself and his own glory. Then Ize lead them almost immediately into war during a very dangerous time - this bet paid off, yes, but cost him a lot of people that could have possibly turned the tide. At no point, either, did he express any kind of remorse or worry over the death of his people. Then instead of fighting with his Army, he went after people on his own - was he luring away the Desert's best fighters? Maybe. It seemed to me more like he was trying to take them on himself to make himself look cool. Eventually, this decision to leave his army alone got both him and his army killed, in a beautiful display of what happens when you bite off more than you can chew.  Thanks, Ize, for being the best worst leader there was. It certainly was entertaining :D
fun fact: every day thousands of mods for minecraft are made and then released lots of them go unidentified and some get very popular.
Ize said that Starkiller would've just kept them on the Island till everyone else killed each other and then came after them... but thats a brilliant strategy?? Starkiller had not only patience, but determination, and belief in his people. I believe he could've lead them to victory, but even if he didn't, I can guarantee he would've been a more efficient and beloved leader than Ize.  Not that it would've been difficult. Ize was an asshole lmao
>everyone in Jungle liked Genshin Good luck, simps, you're gonna need it.
This is like the ultimate confirmation of "Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times produce weak men, weak men make hard times, and hard times create strong men" The jungle, with all their loot and food, found division and greed almost immediately, but the Arctic and Desert tribes knew the use of being organized and working together.
AHHH!! The music from the desert biome brought back a lot of nostalgia
Ize was rude but effective. His only disadvantage was numbers. His blitzkriegs worked amazingly well.
Imagine if a year old server have like this kind of events everyday and role play, would be amazing !  Also watching the jungle civ run it down slowly made my day, that "King pvper" have 0 strat knowledge, 0 charisma
Arctic didn't deserve the loss of all their people.
How did arctic lose the drown vote theirs was so cute 😭
I have brilliant idea  Kindoms again but as a reward for the building vote they get acess to a mod  Like of their choice  And the mods b like  Botania  Blood magic  Create w addons  Because spice is good
Jungle 😭😭😭 They believed in "TATAKAE" 😭😭
Silver how does one join yer modding/event team
I actually love Ize so much.  Like just go kill people
I can't be the only one who thought StarKiller sounded like Izuku Midoriya right?
I enjoyed every single second of this video!! Please make more of these, i’m pretty sure we all want it!
In the Jungle Village coronation, Ice won. Yet, his rival wasn't a tyrant, & would had resulted much more democratic. With him as king, the Jungle Village would had potentially sustained to be the last kingdom, yet politically bad.
Haha second Best potato farmer number one is probably techno blade
More of these since I likedthem
How do I be apart of this epic event?
dam i was rooting for jungle
The end wasn't fair
ize annoyed me this entire video. star was an absolute legend and deserved to be crowned king, especially since he was more peaceful and strategic. the jungle civilization could’ve won if it didn’t have a cocky, annoying, and controlling leader. he lead his entire civilization into a single plan civil war, and literally two people died before it even started. if he had a backup plan it probably would’ve ended better than it did.
I liked jungle
Super cool
i need moreeee
5:02 he sacrificed himself for the other people around him
Jungle leaders is sooo stoopid
I AM GOOD AT REDSTONE AND BUILDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like the  jungle because they were brave but dead
This is better than Netflix.
I would like to see more content with other ppl or other ideas
Actually in real life i would have hated the jungle king, and he did it poorly, if u conquer the first, return and prepare for the second. So i will stay with the dessert, with the worst conditions they still won. In less words, jungle give us drama and content and dessert were perfects
Do it
Do more of these please!!!
I loved the jungle civilization,it was so intense with the civil war and how they were so humble,and their king was great
I’d love to join something like this, could you invite me by commenting on my comment please.
I truly love your content but why did you steal MagicGum’s thumbnail?
See ultimately a dictatorship doesn’t work
this reminds me of WW2 kinda
my only form of seratonin
Jungle the best
i love minecraft
Plz make a sequel on this haha
Jungle king Should go to hell
The arctic slaughter was epic as the choice of words and the footage was amazing
simple, i loved the anime
"Since the dawn of minecraft multiplayuhhhh", what is that accent?
Woah woah man just called natives not people💀
14:25 this shows how greedy genshin impact players are, this dude gave them a free table and then they act like he did nothing
A jungle tyrant... Sounds like a mod in a certain game
im happy that you corrected yourself about squid kid being the best potato farmer in minecraft lol
“I wanna be king, life’s not fair, waaaaaahhh”
I liked the Arctic the most , jungle king was really annoying ngl
jungle king is a whole W
Desert.
THIS CONTENT IS AMAZING
Bruh Ize is so unlikable half way into the video
genshin impact is ass
Am i re watching this video several times so i can write a story with the events. yes, yes i am.     (P.S Im keeping all the characters like Ize and star.
This reminds me of WW2.  Jungle are the Germans  Arctic are the Jews  The desert are the Americans
imagine stealing magic gums thumbnail lol
This was a very good idea
20:46 attack on titan LMAOOO
Bro i thought the snow kingdom was the Best!!
i was also rooting for desert :D
bro this are fun
I wanted the jungle nation to win
ize could have succeeded if he let Starkiller control farming and mining operations
Jungle = Warrior Nation Artic = Peaceful Nation Desert = Knowledge Nation
Least toxic nation won
Mans actually did squid kid dirty
next time can i join ?
lets make this channel the most subscribed youtube channel in history!       and for the video...        lets make it the most LIKED!
35:49 "And you guys killed none of them? -Gosh"
if i was the guy that got those diamonds and stuff i would be SO angry lol
Holy shit Jungle.
And he didnt even give magicgum any credit bruh, he even copied the events
Wish jungle won
Yk i found it interesting that the kingdom with the most power had the most internal conflict
XNestor joined his game at 0:09 xd
desert really had an underdog story. if starkiller was still the leader of jungle they might have had a higher chance by being peaceful
It need me 2 seconds to know Das du ein Deutscher bist
THAT WAS A GOOOOD VIDEO PLZ MAKE MORE LIKE THIS KEEP IT UP
i want but no😭😭
ize is the most annoying person ive ever heard
Chungledor at 22:23 took my name! Given it’s missing 1 letter but that’s to close! I wanna know how he came up with this name cause that’s way to close to mine!
Jungle is the best
38:54 The best moment of this video, that king was truly garbage, i am glad that he got destroyed.
I started out liking the Jungle Kingdom when StarKiller was in charge but after Ize was in charge I switched to the desert team because I just didn't like ize and his personality. He also got mad at star killer just because the people actually liked him and not Ize
2:22 EMOTINAL DAMAGE
Artic was the best because amogus
I was routine for the arctic but the second one was the desert
Ize is dictatorship personified.
I love the way Ize thinks. The name of the game is to invade and kill each other until you're the last civilization. There's no reason to be sitting around waiting for them to get more powerful than you and slaughter you like farm animals. You strike when they don't expect you to strike and even if you die, you die a soldier, not an animal.
Jungle was like hitler in WW2
How do i take part in things like this?
Did squid leave skyblock bc technoblade won and ruined his life
that ize guy sounds like the biggest jerk ever
❤❤❤
what is the mod called?
Arctic before the border openings: vibin Arctic after: dyin
my man has watched the potato war
I think Genshim Impact are the only ads that i don't skip tru lol
I am happy désert won
This is a great social experiment. It has the possibility to be a great series that could even rival Dream's manhunts, especially now that he doesn't have any planned.   More episodes with more biomes, events, and mechanics!
Really enjoyed this video.
i remember when you started, you had around 100k subs with 4 VIDEOS! that was insane.
are u speedsilver
2:14 u placed the diamonds down?
Desert on top
It’s only in Java edition
Your statue did a great job giving fall damage to the jungle player
Ize is the perfect example of why you should never run for leader if you have 0 Charisma points.
To whoever want to play geshin impact; A hint: the age of consent is 18y old
fuck desert and arctic!!!!
Arctic and star killer
The team I hated the most was the jungle because they was not friendly with their own people so I was really happy when they died
WITH SIMULATING SIVILACATION A
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR ANOTHER VIDIO
I wish he still streamed because I loved watching him stream
I was 100% sure the Jungle Faction was going to win. But Ize's thirst for power and conquest were both his strength and his greatest weakness. He was in too much of a hurry to attack the Desert Faction, and his ambition backfired.
you make the part 2
Dessert let's go
Yess
Yeesss genshin impact is here
Yyyeeeessss
This was incredible
Desert was the best
i am mad bruh. the artic city was the best
i wanted jungle to win :-( but atleast they ended up 2nd
I supported desert from the start and they win
JUNGLE IS POWERFUL!!!!!!!
o7
first video i saw from this acc and im in love with the content.
Im gonna be honest I was routing with jungle but the king did act like hitler in ww2
# TEAM STAR
This is the best one of these "minecraft civilization" videos ive seen! Please make more
I liked the artic kingdom the most cuz they are the most friendliest and it is quite easy to get along.. I don't really like kingdom with so ferocious and war thoughts cuz it makes me nervous
I was subbed to him ever since his first video came out. And I instantly saw potential in him, seeing him now with almost 2 million subscribers makes me happy and proud. Subscribe to be part of the before 2 mil club!
Do a s2
More pleasee. Then i sub
I mean jungle litterly deserve this He ruthless kill the artice
I liked the Ice Kingdome the most.They were a great team even tho they died first.
Excellent vid
Wait,so 10 player being killed by a zombie with a wood picaxe and gold leather ammor,really!!!!???
WE NEED ANOTHER ONE
I like the rest of the civilizations
I hated jungle
Why is Ize the putin of minecraft nobody likes him but he is in power
Me watching this video while playing genshin: IT DOES WHAT
@Silver Can I join with tablet?
I also wanna to play This type of server but how ???
ize was based
i liked the jungle nation the most, but under ize they weren't able to win
Love that sponsor 😘👌
Jungel
Can i just mention the music   He used DONKEY KONG MUSIC and fricking MARRIO this brings back so manny  memories  Respect and epic video
Jungle kingdom on top
Ize's complete lack of subtelty when he assassinated Starkiller, you just know most of the jungle people could put 2 and 2 together.
jungle was wealth but desert was smart
i am a og
i liked the arctic so sad they died
Honestly I think Jungle would’ve won if Starkiller would’ve been king
I also want to join how can i?
The jungle biome made the video better
IZEE mined all the way lmao
100% og tumbnail
what
You literary copied magic gums thumbnail
This is why dictatorship never works
I loved the jungle team. The king had great leadership and the members where such good fighters.
Will there be a bedrock version?
Arctic was genuine pog
i hate artic sooo much and desert
Ize aggressive strategy was good, he took both other nations completely by surprise seizing the advantage. He was ultimately just too impatient. He could've taken the 10 minutes necessary to formulate a plan in order to safely travel during the blood moon. That would have been at least 5 soldiers that could've turned the tides in the PvP fights. After his success against the Arctic army he should've paused and acknowledged the fact that they were outnumbered. They had vastly superior gear. They should've again just taken ten minutes to make a plan, they had a perfect opportunity for a real ambush. Nobody expected their bloodthirsty blitzkrieg on the arctic nation, the last thing they'd expect after that was for the madlads to sprint straight there without going back for resupply. If they had just taken a breath and taken 5 or 10 minutes to talk out an actual plan they could've still maintained the element of surprise, and also implemented a real tactical plan, perhaps utilizing their tnt they could've buried clusters of tnt under the sand, each with a designated sapper wielding a flint and steel and each with their own escape tunnel filled with water. Then they could've utilized their heavily geared elites by sending them forward to engage the desert forces, picking off the weaker members and forcing their more elite players to pursue. Intentionally lure them over the tnt that has been placed just beneath the surface of the sand. Detonate it and boom the elite core of the desert army could've been annihilated instantly. Then the moment the tnt goes off the remainder of the jungle forces, who had been purposely spread out and crouching behind cover to remain undetected, could've charged to mop up the remaining desert forces while they were disoriented and confused from the explosion. Any weaker players could have taken up sniper positions with enchanted bows to try and pick off any stragglers trying to escape. That literally took me 5 minutes to come up with by myself lol. Like damn,  "run dat wai and keel stoof!!" Isn't a plan lol
I like how the jungle group turned into a dictatorship 😂😂
"war...war never changes"
wow it’s ukraine
Ize is like killmonger, he wants to do a bit of good, but tries to achieve leadership the wrong way
The Genshin impact music in the background when the jungle was trying to choose the king
Jungle king made the war more fun
30:33  NOT SQUID_KID
More civilization pls
Hating Jungle Nation
At first I thought the jungle kingdom then I saw how rough they were and how the ambushed arctic so I went with arctic and desert
Ize was the perfect villain with a perfect story. An ambitious man who became a powerful warrior. If only he had become Starkiller's military general, perhaps they could have won. Instead, his arrogance and greed compelled him to take over the civilization as a tyrannical warlord and seek world domination. The very thing that cause his rise to power resulted in his demise and the destruction of the jungle tribe. While rallying his soldiers, he condemned Starkiller's strategy,  of "sitting on the island until everyone else kills each other and they come and slaughter you like pigs", but that very same strategy ended up being the reason the democratic, and relatively peaceful desert tribe won in the end.
Ize is the biggest tyrant ever. He deserved to die and lose the war against the desert civilization.
I liked the jungle beacause green is my favorite color
‘I can feel da powa’
bro video is fire but you already had me hooked at the mario music ngl
fk man this really good
Ize was a warmongering Tyrant who held power through fear and had his political opponents killed artic was far to peaceful and disorganized which is why they lost immediately to the Jungle invasion General seup had good thing going for him but for some reason he chose to ally himself with king ize at the end and died because of it the desert king was the wisest he didn't actively seek out war but was skilled at defending his people
Is this on Java or bedrock
Ah yes the second best potato farmer.
i liked the jungle kingdom before the reign of ize
the way that the jungle  got the votes. . . its like . . bro.
The Arctic was my favorite
Tbh, in the start I had an un explained feelings that desert army will win, and it did!
I've was fckin ruthless
scripted
just started watching and im going for jungle
I like jungle
Nice
All I know is that I Would go with the VIKINGS
This goes to show that autocratic aggression only gets you so far. Just ask Putin.
rip jungle they should have won
I liked the Arctic kingdom the most
“Led by the best potato farmer… wait I read that wrong. Second best potato farmer in Minecraft, squid kid.”   Made me laugh so hard. Man had to rub the potato war in.
Really Good Video I Just Subscribed:)
The civilization I wanted to win won.  Well I mean.. at first I wanted the jungle civilization to win, then the arctic.. then the desert.. but I definitely was rooting for desert towards the end of the video
Why did you steal magic gums thumbnail
The zombie at the end was so wholesome
the snow people were so peaceful until the fire I mean jungle nation attacked
ur mom  🍇🍊🥝🏛🏞🏥🏘🏟🏰🎯👚🎵📷🚯🚱
the jungle biome people do be fatherless doe
arctic for the amongus
"oh genshin impact hell yeah baby"
This was beautiful.
OH MY GOD I HATE THE IZE SO MUCH
this is actually awesome, keep up the good work, Silv!
jungle is nice
Hear me out but i think ize is the best king he manage to wipe out entire artic he even try to wipe desert despite being outnumber by them he littelary a legend in a future jungle kingdom
Great concept
I liked the jungle kigdome
I was rooting for arctic :(
Why is Ize and Star Killer like animal farm's Snowball and Napoleon...
Saw genshit infact ad, instantly disliked.
bro starkliller was better
Make more of this plsss:(
Desert
Ize is everything I hate in people honestly
desert is my fav
A physically strong leader is not the best leader especially without wisdom
Honestly, this is pretty cool. They should definitely make more.
Ize was a bad king. He lead by fear and made impulsive decisions. While he got lucky enough to not lose many to the blood moon, he didn’t plan effectively nor did he motivate correctly. Star killer would have led the jungle to victory. Ize was cocky, foolish and inefficient
jungle was the best
#rexcat
PLEASE, make more of this!!! I would say it was my most favorite Minecraft video. I would love to see a part 2
Starkiller should have led the jungle
the most civilization i like was the artic, but they was been defeated and become bad ppl
I was rooting for the Arctic team they seemed to be getting along so well unlike jungle.
amazing
who were the two players that looted the jungle temple?
jump scare at 30:27
Desert
I wanna join too
It is so cool how you grew to 1 million subs throughout only 30 videos
this video is so cool
Jungle king took a page from Sherman’s book but it didn’t work too well for him
such a great video. Ize was such a fun character in this epic. a greedy, power hungry king. burned to ashes by the flames of the war he started
Never attack other civilization when there are only 3 civilization, either you annihilated them completely or you're going to face 2 civilization.
Just loved the artic … you care more about you content then 2 innocent lives   The artic nation
35:50 “and you killed none of them? _Gosh_”
This was really fun to watch make sure to make more videos like this❤️❤️❤️❤️
38:15 anyone else notice the egg
Jungle biome is russian personified
8.43 you put a trapped chest and the tnt was activated when you opened the chest
man this video is good!
Bitch what lag 😂😂😂
idk why, i dont support totalitarism of dictatorship, but i liked ize ngl
Silver your videos are always epic  I love watching your videos ❤
*Jungle wins for me*
This guy has such a irritating voice
The Jungle kingdom had some much promise, but fell when starkiller died
jungle king top 10 anime betrayals of all time
Aye bro this was a lit video great work
I instantly knew the desert would win because of how rough the environment was to survive in if they could pull that off they'd be good
It was so satisfying to see Ize get a reality check when the desert kingdom began counterattacking and realise that autocratic leadership, deception and tyranny will only get you so far
cringe moment
Make a 100 days in the end as the end the shapeshifter
Any chance you can make this mod for mobile? I have a realm, and for the fifth season I'm going to have kings and kingdoms.
hi
Technoblade could probably kill all three nations at once
JUNGLE RULES
The jungle King guy was well cocky
You need to do more of these
I love these vids
Good. Justice has been served.
I don't see homeless men
Wow, this thumbnail is totally not copied.
Paimon is very funny
Awe :( I loved Arctic’s town center. Thought they would win.
That Irish guy with the full diamond represents everything I hate about gamers
Honestly I wanted jungle to win because they were the only one who wanted to fight
Ize is a godamn villian
The desert and jungle temple did look like the builds from trixyblocks usw world
Hello
Jungle used blitzcrig
this is just a copy of MagicGum`s video
All i have to say that the editing is great!
For me it was desert artic and jungle
i was really hoping arctic was going to win because in my opinion, they were the best besides soup
It’s sad that the arctic died. They were so nice
I am serious: I would give my LIFE if it meant I could participate in one of these.
Wtf
Oh yeah someone else did this a while back, I remember hearing a story about it.
I like the jungle civilization
Putin's Irish son ruined it for jungle
The jungle kingdom has the best lore
Ize was so cringe i felt bad for jungle
Jungle
Can we join with TL
More please
Youre voice gave me ear cancer
pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee do more of these ty for the vid :)
Jungle for life
I actually liked them all because they were all unique silver
Spoilers:    The Arctic King looting and backstabbing Desert was actually foreshadowed by his previous actions against other unsuspecting people. This is a magnificent piece of art, hot damn!
by the way how did one of the players become a zombie??????
why does everybody want to be king? just pick a guy that has good leadership and loyalty
its really good that som1 died right at genshin
Yoooooooo that animation was sick.
This is a very interesting concept. I love this!
I completely forgot about this channel until now and I remember when this guy just started out it was awesome I'm glad I found this channel again
Just wanted to say:  Ioz was so f**king annoying
I will make you watch... ROFL
Boi we need moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Boi we need moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Ize is like that one painter who were leader of germany
IS THAT SQUID KID??
How to join that server, I wanna join
I loved the jungle
the guy that brought the zombie payed off.
made another video like this pls
we need a season 2 of this
Just started watching, I'm rooting for the Arctic civilization for now  After: I ended up rooting for Desert after Arctic died
Arctic just sat around with their thumbs up their asses
Wow, amazing vid and amazing sponsor ❤️
It's a shame that so few recognise this:  Armies win battles, but logistics wins wars.  The best thing to do post-victory is to heal, consolidate and come up with an actual plan that isn't rush b lol
Maybe it wasnt the best idea for Ize to lead with fear but i know for a fact the jungle squad wouldve been decimated with that kiss up star killer as king. The type of dude to try to negotiate while his village is being pummeled. L starkiller
The cow was a necessary sacrifice to gain the Power 😂
Your videos are awesome and have taken up more than 4 hours of my day today, really entertaining that I forgot time. I just subscribed and hope to see more amazing content!
Dude best video of sliver history!!
Next time add a population rising attribute so that after every X minutes, X amount of players get added and X amount of players get removed. Both with same rate as of real world.   Wikipedia says: UN, medium variant, 2019 rev. The average global birth rate was 18.1 births per 1,000 total population in 2021. The death rate was 7.7 per 1,000. The 2021 average of 18.1 births per 1,000 total population equates to approximately 4.3 births per second or about 259 births per minute for the world. And 7.7 is close to half of that so basically ~2.2 deaths per second....  Now go figure out how to accurately implement this in a minecraft simulation.
I like how is desert leader are doing not like jungel leader he always takes risks
What a way to win Zombie citizen wins
7:14 😂
The jungle power struggle...  It reminds me how people think their good while being completely tyrannical...
why does jungle remind me of Germany in ww1 - tyranny takes over - blitzkrieg - the first attack was successful - enemy join forces - lost after all effort of the leader
Ize was definitely bad for the job, but, why does star just *sound* like a stereotypical politician? It'd be low key off putting lol
i think is story but im watching minecraft
rip starkiller he was a real one
More videos like this shiii fire 🔥
wow didnt expect freemogems in a minecraft video
Is there a way that i can join?
W player to the person bringing back the zombie teammate L for the tyrant leader
took me a second to realize ize was isaacfearless, wow its been a long time since I heard his VOICE.
This was a masterpiece
THE ZOMBIE WA SICK LMAO
Are u on feather client?
Bruh a mad king, cringe as to how he really thinks he is everything.
20:48 was hilarious but unfortunate.
connor mcgreggor leading the jungle kingdom 🤣
this is what you call a herd of species who dont shower or touch grass 9:03
You need to do this again it was amazing
Jungle on top
Hate that jungle "king"  because of his cocky arse
THAT AD TRANSITION WAS SO GOOD
Artic And Desert King Was More Better Than Jungle's King
in the middle of the video, i’m so glad ize won, starkiller at the time sounded so terrible and toxic
i hate ize
His last worlds genshin impact
LOL the two artic scouts were the G, they were alert as hell
The desert kingdom was the coolest but that blitz by the jungle was amazing.
Pls make more lol the effort put into the video is amazing
Jungle ftw unlucky
This guy stole this thumbnail and the idea from another guy called MagicGum
Please part 2
I feel bad for the Arctic-
I'll pay you 10 grand to say "number 15, burger king foot lettuce"
Anyone else notice the Genshin music in the background
jungle civilisation like a call of duty lobby
Please do more of these
Moral of the story: Authoratarian regimes will always rise, but in the end they always capitulate.
genshit
32:41 how could you fall for that dude
The dead among us statue was the cherry on top of the invasion😂😂
Lmao even the omongis statue died
Jungle Nation destroying ice nation's among us statue is on another level psychological warfare hehe
9:04  bro this better be staged
When I saw nestorio was in it, I knew it was going to be a good obe
You gotta do more of this
I wanna see something like this but its the purge!
I hated the jungle kingdom and their leader lmao sounds like a tool
No matter what I love ize he is the perfect antagonist ever I was even rooting for him on both invasions
Trying to be in a video do you have to have a phone
Of couse the town full of brits invades the other towns first
New desert kingdom would win from the start desert forever!!!!
I think the arctic was my favorite, they were funny and were just really coordinated with each other, the same thing could also be said for the desert, but they were a little more hostile than the arctic
Honestly the jungle king sounds like a discord mod
40:20 Im so happy that jungle team didnt win lol, their leader is disgusting
My favorite civilization was the jungle civilization. They were a really cool one.
is there any chance to get the map and data packs?
I like how he stole this idea. He even stole the thumbnail, LMAO
ize is the best
a guys have full diamant armor so fast I'm sure is use xray
I really hope this guy doesn’t have a dark secret, I like his content.
I know that ize is oppresive tyrant and his ways are awful to me, but I admire and respect him for his determination and strength to become the leader of his nation and lead jungle to fight. Maybe the reason is that i am also the enemy of democracy XD I really vowed for jungle, sad that their military junta was freezed...generally, i have to Say..ize...You did your job NICE...the political tensions you provided made my day. All for content, as Silver said...
The jungle king has turned into putin, making them fight
ize was such a well written character i despised him the entire time
I was cheering for jungle team until they admitted they like genshin impact Yeah we know how fat they are
Why tf didn’t the desert get first place in the competition. Rigged
That one guy “oh GI oh hell yeah baby!”
Jungle
I was routing for the artic civilization.
IZE sucked as a leader, knew he would not win from the start.
This was so good! We need mote
This is amazing. It's like reality TV but for gamers. Hearing teammates conspire against each other was hilarious!
are you a zelda fan, i'm asking because you mentioned the blood moon (which is in breath of the wild)
I was routing for Jungle.
Lol Technoblade now
bro you sound like you have the flu im sorry but
I can't lie Jungle should've been last
j
WHY GENSHIN IMPACT SOUND 😡😡😡🌝🌝(love it tho)
What is the next server adress
That's what happens to bloodthirsty dictators that invade their neighbors. Jungle died and nobody was even sad about it. I'm wondering, wouldn't they prefer eating carrots?
genshin sucks dick
I laughed way too hard when the guy said "Oh Genshin Impact Hell Yeah Baby!"
I don't know why the algorithm brought me here, but 41 minutes later, I'm glad it did.
was rooting for jungle until the tyrant took over and assinated the other king. just an uneccesary kill tbh.
We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to see Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye
My fav was winter/snow or what ever
I'm glad jungle didn't win
I was sort of rooting for Ize and the Jungle.  But he became too confident after his easy victory over the Arctic.
The fact squid was there got me rooting for the artic …
technoblade fans got triggered when u said best potato farmer XD
Do you want with four simulations
Ngl the jungles king,I didn't like his attitude,that would've made me vote for iron dude,can't talk like that to ur team
So good, this made me sub
ir would like me if the jingle dictator won against desert
Only real og's remember the hypixle skyblock days so sad wish he  would come back
Arctic joining Desert after a war is like Ukraine joining NATO after ... Russian soliders (involuntarily) attacking Ukraine
I’m a lil curious did he credit the guy who made it originally
What started as the most successful civilization in terms of resources and raw power, they inevitably end up being ruled by a democratically elected totalitarian dictator that forced them into a conquest of world domination which invariably ended in their own demise. Very Nazi-esque.
This was so cool man
wow didn't expect to see privatefearless
ize was so annoying jesus
The quality of this video is better than most movies!! I didn't even mean to click it but I'm so glad I did, it's just amazing!!!!
arctic: in my opininon is okay they where inda vibing . jungle: at the beggening they where humble and friendly then eyes took rule and than i hated them. desert: was the i was rooting for i like them
I just realized that if starkiller became the king of the jungle civilization,a world war would have been avoided 😂
YES!!! 🤣2ND BEST POTATO FARMER
NAHH HE DID SQUID KID SO BAD
This entertained me so well, great content.
Me mostly like desert
PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2
hate that jungle guy tryna become king 💀 his accent and everything just annoyinh
Wait, this is SpeedSilver??
this was more entertining and gripping than the entire back half of Game fo Thrones. The politics, the war, the loyalties, the betrayal, the everything else. DO MORE
I was rooting for the arctics and specifically the squid guy
Bro that Irish don is so annoying
i need more of this content
jungle should have killed desert first
God, that Jungle King was getting under my skin. Him being King was for His power; their nation went up against two. Starkiller would have easily been able to make peaceful and prosperous relationships for as long as the game allowed with the other nations.
this is the best stroy i seen please do more
Jungle deserves that win man. So disappointing!
This was amazing that zombie was clutch
I wabt speedsilver back i loved ur skyblock vids :c
JUNGLE CIVILISATION OP!!!!!!!
I liked arctic the least
I loved the arctic nation, they were so wholesome with all that ice ring and church, but the other nations had so much going on like the undead Abstrekt and Ize the tyrant. How did they make  Abstrekt the zombie stand there idly tho 39:55
Anyone realize that was Mario Wii music?
Just glad the forest lost, their king was a douche maximum.
genshin impact is bad
With better strategy Ize would've been on track to be this world's Caeser
PART 2 NOWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I feel like this is something that would be taught in social studies class
What’s up Broski 🦋.
This is the content that I have been searching for
Izes tyranny made this videos and was not expecting to watch this whole thing like my favorite show lmao
Is this like ukrain and russia
I'm glad The Desert Kingdom won  I didn't like Iyz the King of the Jungle  He was a very ruthless and rude person who had some real attitude I'm glad he lost but Good Game Desert I was honestly rooting for as an individual Squid Kid because he seemed like a chill underrated server to his team  Good Video Silver I like how crucial of a rule you played too  Wishing you more success in the future
how many people wanted jungle to win?😮‍💨
Zombie Guy and his faithful friend were the only people worth rooting for, i wanted to see Ize get a knife in the back from go. powermongered, used it as a rationale for capability of leadership when he couldnt even make a case for himself besides "but i have gear" and then got his teeth kicked in anyway. Arctic honestly got shafted super hard before fighting even started but the general wasnt really that much more preferable since they started sacking the Desert once the Jungle showed up and killed off the solitary jungle refugee along with the first blood of the guy who dropped all their gear.  4/10 movie, boring villains who things go way too favorably for with a tropey ending of good always triumphs not a single backstabbing or subversion
“Sorry I read that wrong, SECOND best potato farmer”  Potato war flashbacks
no joke ive wached this 3 times because i love it that much make more pls
I would love to join one of these, how do I do that?   Seriously.
The Irish guy was too angry lol
Me wondering why didnt anyone try to form an alliance: oh damn this sum great content should sub rn
Jungle king was shit
2:15 first civilization being given diamond XD
Please more!!!!!!
Genshin impact is gay
this is VERY fun to watch
I like the sand civilization because DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL!
I just had so much fun watching this
How to join Minecraft civilization ?
It feels like jungle is German back then.. if you know what I mean
wth is that acent? xD
Hands down the best Minecraft videos, keep the great content coming man!
Foooo thats soooooooh cooooooooohl imnsi foooooooohll
Why it ends like this
This is like the earth kingdom vs the fire nation vs the water tribes
RIP for the guy who died first and on start of the vid that guy must have an f- lucky rank
The jungle kingdom is the PERFECT example of a paranoid military ruled communist state. Whilst the desert kingdom functioned more in a democratic way, and the artic kingdom was basically sandwiched between them
Arctic because amogus
I liked the artic team.
World war 69
I Loved The Arctic Civilization
so... No one's gonna talk about how the Jungle killed the crewmate after slaughtering the Artic?
God have mercy on u through Christ
Gensh*t imp*ct 🤢
If we kill all enemy out there Will we be free? Said by arctic king
I love this guys videos man.
I bet this has connections with the ukraine russia conflict
Man! This was really  awsome.  IT was far better than even justice leage in my opinion  . It was  logically a movie. Liked the desert country the most, feel sorry for starkiller, and great thanks to the zombie guy. I think that The writer of this plot is a geneus.  Sir,If you ever make a sequel ,please include something like invasions and More countries, and maybe some org between the countries like the un  Maybe.
jung leader was kinda trash ngl
This is like rise of kingdoms but minecraft ver
Among Us bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
Oh Mongols bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum Among Us
i liked the artic civilization the most they even had an escape plan for their king
I wanted to join like this one lol
Plz second part
I loved arctic players
I rooted for Ize the whole time, I hated starking as he was using pure charisma and manipulation into getting the role of king whilst Ize actually grinded and used logical thinking to convince jungle.
Dude Ize called Starkiller Jim Jones but in the end he was the one who snapped like Jim Jones
How much did you pay them to jump when you said jump if you like genshin impact
The narration and the effort you put into this is awesome! hoping for a new video like this ^_^
I like this kind of content keep it up!
That zombie is the greatest plan
I actually really liked both dessert and arctic but after the lootbox incident I was just rooting for the dessert, I didn't really like the jungle cuz I don't like toxic ppl
That first one was ONE PUNCH MAN 😂😂
This was sooo good pls part 2
this was actually amazing 🤩
when u posting a new vid on speedsilver
Artic has the most chill player among all civilazation.
Rise of Kingdoms if it weren’t a shitty mobile game that is host to a ton of shitty ads that make me want to kill myself everytime one shows up
The mushy salmon invariably guide because jellyfish substantially develop vice a ill pillow. icy, bustling wire
Jungle Civilization King is Like H*tler
I just LOVE IT
Ize is the embodiment of "When you lead a soldier by fear, he can only go so far."
I find it so messed up, that the 2nd jungle king was making really good points, and was called cocky.
l like this:')
Ize basically became napoleon and stalin at the same time
That is so cool, I hope i can participate in one of these myself
Why was the jungle king is so cocky
I liked every player, except fore the jungle king
2:55 dont
I think jungle had the best leader, one that actually fought and helped his team
BoTW Blood moon!!
Please make more!!!
Your using liyue danger theme
The jungle has everything food water and resources while the desert doesnt have much food or resources and the snow doesnt have much food I love the rise and fall of the jungle tribe where instead of listening to reason they elected someone cocky and ruthless cleary not to be a king and when he was elected he became more powerful and spiteful a man who has everything status food water amazing gear and a strong group compared to the dessert , our heroes who are not given much but because of their strong sense of community they begin catching up by using a zombified teamate and using their intelligence they double their diamonds and increase their strength but when jung;e defeats snow the desert is unaware until one of the snow cleverly kill a jungle arming the desert with knoledge and now coming to the climax the strength of our opponent is clear as they wiped out snow without any casualties and the two underdogs forming an alliance a big battle errupts and the jungle seems to be winning until the desert stop panicking and use their numbers to overpower the jungle and the last of the snow and it was such an awesome ending that played out like a brilliant story but it was all organic and that was so awesome this was one of my favorate videos ever and I am glad that I watched it and ize is the perfect antagonist
This is a movie lol TEAM JUNGLE
sades death ever :(  15:08
Happy that lies or eyes or w.e bitch didnt win
if i was in jungle withthem i would stragiat upmake star the genrale commander and the annoying guy the a millitary officer with crown and give him permmision for any attack he wants to dois his responsibilty .
The Jungle King #2 was kind of a jerk, taking out the original king to make himself the new King, but the Desert planned better really, even tho they started small
imagine if techno, illumina, and dream was in the game bro, the war will be so great
cheers to that player who bought the abstrek zombie back, it really helped alot
I need this to be a game for all time
This vid was clean asf
last jungle guy didn't deserve that he should have been put with the deserts :/
yoooo i loved this vid i was ruteing for desert and they won lets goooo!!!!!!!
The invasion at 28:05 looks like DDay tbh
There were 23 people then it was 25
ize pack in the air
My fav man was suep
This is genuinely a great video. Congrats
This is so cool
Fuck the Jungle King      All my homies hate the Jungle King
Honestly so glad that Jungle lost after Ize took over. The man was tyrant of a king. If I was under him I definitely would've just left during the fight to try and warn the desert.
Bro, Ize really wanted to be the main character, huh?
I like desert, but i guess if first Jungle king wasn't assasinated i guess they still wouldn't win. And i like arctic cause they are creative but they lost quickly.
I mean honestly... How can you beat a civilization that learned Necromancy
This is cool but its too small in scale. Next time make more Kingdoms with more players in each kingdom.
Not to judge but I hope Ize is not remotely like that irl.
The jungle was definitely the most interesting. I was rooting for them the entire vid
The desert because he do not sorrow and fight back
Bro made minecraft more realistic
arctic was so innocent, i hate jungle
WTF
If starting was king I think jungle would of won
DUMB FRESHIE
love this content!
That move on Starkiller was brutal. He should’ve been king.
I saw the title and I was immediately intrigued.
I was wanting the Jungle to win. But when rebellious activity was happening I knew they were going to become a corrupt nation.
Ngl the jungle kingdom is sweaty especially the king
people like ize are the reason things are the way they are now
I love artic so much cus they all is innocent lol
Ngl Ize was right about that one guy, seemed a bit annoying. Definitely should’ve geared his ppl up more could’ve pulled it off
Jungle Civilisation People: YOU HAVE ENCHANTMENT TABLE!!  I DON'T!  ARTIC CIVILIZATION PEOPLE: SILENTTT NIGHTTTTTT AMONG US AMONG US
Can you make another civilization video
i was so desperately trying to find a side to pick but i love them all so equally.  jungle coming from a confusing and odd political situation to becoming being a powerful, bloodthirsty enemy/villain and the arctic being peaceful and resilient, joining desert yet still striving to win for their nation. the desert capital wasnt too lively, but i like their laid back nature, their strong defence when attacked, their god like building skills and their amazing, calm and organised leadership. (+ mad respect to invictable, the person who brought abstrekt the zombie back. so much patience)  (i ended up siding with arctic because of their peaceful nature and strong will to survive, even when the odds where against them.. and they lost. it was moving though.)  safe to say, im a complete nerd and i took this too seriously.
The animations and the editing is super cool it made me subscribe
The jungle warriors may be strong, but nor one can overpower the ferocity of the *scorching deserts*
suop main theme is basically Soledier of 3 armies.
even the amongus statue died
This video was so good and fun to watch :D good job! :)
The fact that he is using genshin music ye
I just wanna say that this was 🦆ing sick.  I would love to join one of these.
Jungle army was led by hitler
I liked Attic the most but after most died Desert
I feel like the last jungle guy should have got netherite armor
Not really a spectacular time for this video to come out lol (obviously not the uploaders fault just timing)
Hey speed do you still play skyblock if yes can you help me in catacombs name armex
We will remember you as a hero StarKiller98K. If only the jungle wasn't so power hungry, you would've been a great leader I'm sure of it.
I think jungle king ize was to cocky
This was like a movie
Genres of each civilizations during the first half Arctic: Slice of life,Comedy Desert: Tragedy, Post-apocalyptic Jungle: Drama, Action
I feel like I'm in social studies, and I like it
Yknow, if Ize actually had a secondary plan other than "burn, maim, kill" he realistically, would have trounced the remaining desert army, even with the artic recruits
I think more kingdoms would make this more interesting ngl  This was great!
Jungle was so entertaining to watch
Ize was an asshole, I bet he was so mad when he got killed 😂😂😂😂😂 L Child
I hope whoever said “Guys don’t be persuaded, he just has an accent!” knows they are my favorite
honestly the jungle village was so wholesome.....till they started murdering everyone
out of all that ive watched this was the funniest ending
Damn this predicted Russia
Man, i would love to join something like this  Also that jungle "leader" is the type of guy who plays COD on xbox
the storm the temple and kill the indigenous peoples narrative leave a bad after taste just saying :/
the desert civilization was my favorite lol im glad they won
Upload more
Please more of this
Me and my brother liked the jungle one. It is a shame that they lost.
Dude in the Jungle decided to be Stalin in Minecraft
Glad to hear the Jungle Kingdom didn’t win
in the description you forgot to put infernally!!! (in the, "check out these other players content")
i really loved the wholesomeoness between the artic people but its sad they lost so early but im glad desert won cuz they really deserved it especially the zombie guy :)
Imagine Gaslighting and being an asshole instead of just saying "Hey guys, the crown gives Double Health and Protection. I am the most skilled and best equipped person here and I have some enchants so I should wear the crown."
soup or what his name is shouldve spared the guy dropping armor
the jungle warrios are the best
I remember when silver only had 15 vids and 1-3k subs
As a traveller of teyvat, the large world has many fun adventures to be excited for, join Genshin impact for amazing cutscenes and characters!! 💗💗
The guy in jungle that was full diamond is such a pick me.
Desert
Jungle. Arctic. Desert. The three nations once lived together in harmony. But then everything changed when the Jungle Nation attacked.
artic
awesome vid' tkx
alittle late this released on my birthday : D
Jungle was easily best and strongest team but their first problem happened 09:00 - 17:00, and Jungle became doomed after 28:00
“Talking them up like jim jones” man got a brain XD
Ayy squid kid
the jungle king was a idiot
1:47 *thes flou!!!*
i really fw the subtle nintendo game music playing in the background
At least credit the dude who did it first and didn’t blatantly steal the idea
This was one of the most entertaining Minecraft videos I ever watched! So much effort must have went into this.
this was so fun to watch, i want to see more.
i loved the arctic because it just looks 10x more fun than the desert and jungle
damn jungle king needs to eat less his fat got to his brain real quick
Artic
This guy sounds like the developmentally mentally disabled cop from family guy
the jungle leader was reminding me of stalin was rotting for the snow or desert
Jungle dude pulled a Putin and got his squad killed lol
Do other i made 100 player plsss the other one is so awesome
arctic had the best builds i was wanting them to win
jungle would of fun if it wasnt for there experienced players
boo jungle king
hmm... a militaristic leader take the power, silence the opposition, and lead a lightning fast war (some might even say a blitzkrieg) with vastly superior gear against an unprepared neighbor and win, only to be stopped after a grueling war with another nation because they spread too thin... now where did I see that before ?
Part 2
ha ha funny techno joke.
Again again again, this is awesome
“The bes- second best potato farmer in Minecraft, squid_kid” XD
Artic was my my favourite
Jungle is too hostile
Sequel plz
Well i really want the map and the mods if anyone has it
Me *sees squidkid* :oh hey  Vid: the best po- no wait... the second best potato farmer  Me: oh shit, he can never live that down can he
god this is the best organized mc civilization event i've ever seen!!!!  I have to say that i really loved the jungle faction. they were the most interesting nation to watch and they were really lucky to have two magnetic personalities be on their team.  i really like how even if the first few stages disabled pvp and really encouraged people to synergize, there was still enough room for opposing factions to form within nations. the best part of this is they had enough time to really develop their chemistry and convince people of their own agenda w/o mindlessly killing anyone who opposes. This happened only on the middle stages, but at this point, it's acceptable because we had already seen the important confrontations and the following development of the internal politics, so it's more or less expected that assassinations and executions would happen.
One of the best videos I’ve ever watched
I volunteer myself as tribute for next event!!! Pick me if you need someone willing to go out for some good content!
28;05 This is D-Day all over again.
I liked the Arctic Kingdom the most. dk why tbh
bro the best video ever
Say what you want about the jungle king, the dude played to win!
Give me another one now or ☠️
Its a sponsored video panik The sponser isnt that long (kalm) Its genshin impact (panikkkk)
Jungle would of clapped there enemies if they didn’t have inside problems
THE Desert was my favourite. Btw that was cool
DAMN! Masterpiece!, iam crying
Pls do more
Jungle: Cocky idiots. Arctic: Did not have a choice. Desert: Best team in conclusion.
I loved the artic nation
Plzzzz do a server for pocket edition
respect to arctics they were just vibing
Russia invading Ukraine
love the fact that you used genshin impact music as background, so nice!
Need more of this, it's like a story
genshin impact hell yeah baby guy is a giga chad
What if wars irl were done in Minecraft
Artic with desert
Make more
i want to see atleast 50 players surviving the Survive and Escape parasites mod.
i hate the king of jungle so much, he took power by fear and became a true dictator
Real life wars: lasts a few years Minecraft wars:eh maybe a few days I dunno
The jungle were really strong and i liked them a lot. I had hope that they would win, but sadly, they didnt... :(
more pls
the jungel king is soooo annoying
Id like to see civilisation in the nether, would be very interesting. Ofc I think it's fair they get some starting gear cuz... It's a Hell, like it's literally Hell what other reason is there?
Damn the irony. How is such a prosperous nation full of food supply and resources being the first one to attack other nations?  How the people with least need for resources being the one with most resources.  Also respect for the guy who spent a journey to bring a zombie to the capital.   As for soup. Yeah what a tragic protagonist is he did not switch side to jungle he will also be part of the winning team.  Or is it...? (Well, the possibility of him  join jungle to assassinate the king was also exist. Some kind of sacrifice play or some sort.)   We can publish this story as a book.
You can literally make a story out of this
The fact that star killer would have lead them into a peaceful life and be a much leader is sad
I loved the jungle kingdom but it all went downhill when Eyes was elected.
Someone is really biased against Among Us :p  Any, Ize is by far the worse of the three tyrannical players, alongside Clownpierce and Solev. He only wanted power for the sake of power, and he ignored how good leadership Star was doing. Once he got power, he displayed overall incompetence by not doing anything to boost his civs morale, which lead to frequent backstabs and going against one another. His political image didn't help him either as he would threaten to kill someone if he met them. His Military tactics was terrible, he had no unit cohesion with any of his group, And his use of intimidation tactics resulted in his troops being easy routed and killed. Everyone was apart from one another, which easily allowed the Desert Kingdom to group up and pick them off one by one. All Ize had as a "Leader" was Crazy charges with no other strategy behind them, it worked against the Artic because they were off guard, but once the desert kingdom was warned, this strategy was easily taken apart.  Ize is the perfect example of a sweaty player who takes everything too seriously and thinks brute force is the solution to everything.  Edit: Now that time has past, and newer civilization videos are popping up, I think I will take Solev off the list. Solev is a decent player depending on the map, if its a map with only one group to start, then he can become a decent leader; If its a multi nation map, then yea that's where his flaws start showing up. Harboring treacherous refugees and calling their parent nation "Tyrant", dispersing his military during political turmoil, have no watch towers alongside the coast to watch for invaders, etc. He's inexperienced when it comes to running a military.
Will you give me the code of this server
Make the new one a scp apocalypse against scp 2845
So stupid jungle king Jesus
we want more civillization vids !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
28:00 this is literally d-day but in minecraft.
On my other account I subbed when you were at 400k
If starkiller was alive I think jungle would win
jungleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
9:05 Silver:  Everyone, Jump if you like genshin impact Everyone: WOO!! Me: Fuck this shit I'm out man
Desert....
ize or jungle kings was a prick , didnt like him much
i liked the articts but jungle destroy them that means i love more the deserts
Did anyone notice the bgm is from genshin impact?
Great thinking using genshin impact bgm bcs they sponsor you 🤣🤣🤣
yooo im rooting for jungle bc they like genshin impact
Why did sUep join the Jungle KIng? I was rooting for him!
This video was really entertaining
I like dessert kingdom

Desert is the best
Say what you will about the Jungle King but he made this video 10x more entertaining XD
More
I love yure videos I always watch it When im eating So perfect
Sad I didn’t he picked
This could be a whole series in netflix and i would watch it
The jungle guys used the blitzkrieg on the Arctic lads
I love jungle their teamwork is the best
PLZ ANOTHER CIVILIZATION VIDEO
Jugle team is so chaotic i would rather join the artic team.
Ize sounds like "more dots" guy from WoW
make a season 2
i liked the artic and sadly they did not win
idk what civilization i liked the most but definetley hated jungle
Honestly I loved the jungle King if he wasn't king the video wouldn't be intresting enough
Perfect ending. If I may suggest a system for bringing people back to life? Would make things a little bit more spicy and add more content.
I don't like the jungle leader
That’s a Mayan temple
I think it would be better to make a discord because I am quite young and don’t have twitter
37:07 "I had a cow!"
SHEEEESH ZOMBIE OP
I was so hooked!!!!
Imo the jungle king was a jerk they made a mistake by choosing him
I had my genshin open and i thought i ws getting attacked from the music haha
I have a idea for this kind of minecraft fun experiment every 20 day each person has the ability to reincarnate one dead person basically like reproduction but not with the disgusting stuff so that way population increase
Love ur vids 😍😍😍😍
Jungle civilization vas the best
You legit just copied magic gum’s thumbnail almost verbatim
Hitler 😂
This was such a fun video to watch lmao
Wtf aquino gringo
37:36 bruh
Freakin loved it bro.hope u make a sequel soon
the first jugle king ws so damn cocky
This is the first “Civilization days” I’ve seen that I’ve actually enjoyed! Great work on world events and cast!
I liked the artic
Soup betrayed
These types of videos are always so goddamn interesting
Wish the jungle kingdom won but oh well it was still cool and exciting when the zombie dude became the definition of " I always come back!"
I was rooting for the Arctic general
i cried when starkiller got murdered so I have something to say the killer of star FUCK YOU YOUR JUST JEALOUS THAT STAR KILLER ACTUALLY KNEW HOW TO BE A KING
Why did u choose GENSHIN !!!!!???!!!!!!11!1!1!!1
Honestly as soon as that loser got elected king of the jungle I knew they were going to lose. And I’m gonna say it, I’m glad they did. I hope his egos hurt.
I really feel like jungle could have won if starkiller was king
Pls add a sequel i need this pls pls pls
Guys I brought you full diamond and enchants who are you gonna vote for 🤓
Dessert king deserved to win
Probably staged for the most part but still really fun
23:38 skeppy is that you?
Copy of ish. Clone.
As shown in history multiple times, the era after a revolution is always bad
Bro I think you should make this series again but by inviting 3 famous Youtuber minecraft as the king🙏🙏
i totally didn't just let a tear out for the one jungle soldier who tried to join the desert group, i'm pretty sure he was the same one who said "this isn't what Starkiller would have wanted" before they attacked the snow group
38:35 best part of the whole thing
🙁 I was hoping jungle would win.
Anyone have a game that's basically this? Or is there just a mod for minecraft?
This is very entertaining keep making more.
Is it bad that I always hope that the kingdom with the tyrant for a king wins😂
A tyrant kings military might will never overpower the unity of a great people
The jungle dude that left on his own to come back and claim the kingdom out of fear shows that leading out of fear never wins.
i haven't finished watching yet. buuuut that Jim Jones comment got me 😂😂😂😂
Genshin battle theme
Jungle Usurper too cocky swinging his pvp skill in NETHERITE. Reason why blitz krieg doesnt always win.
"2nd best potato farmer" EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
That was awesome
Jungle leader just dumb asf
Plssss more content like this
I more than like desert becuzz there have good team alaso there have team work
Me playing Genshin when h starts talking about it
i watched the whole video :)
Its sort've poetic irony that a dead team member was the one to get the final blow.
I would love to join something like this, I've been looking for something new to stream, and this would be just perfect, especially since I've been wanting to do something with Minecraft for a bit now
I LOVED THIS PLEASE DO IT AGAIN
I would recommend the jungle region cause it has lots of wood and cocoa beans
You should have a repopulation system, 1 player gets added to each faction every day as long as you are under the maximum population capacity.
Imagine technoblade joining
jeez, Ize was just an unbearable prick.
I knew the jungle was gonna lose cuz of there stubborn leader 💀
Bro it’s so interesting how they actually had political battles like a real country
Knew it desert would win
Love these
Desert nation hitler 😒
Please do more
This is the best video ive seen for a long time
The jungles king was bout the most stubborn, stupid, and idiot person I’ve ever seen. He’s so rude to.
yo ize from jungle being the new putin
ARTIC WAS THE BEST BRO
bro you're talking way to fast
I can’t join the discord :(
im glad they won
Jungle ftw
Jungle leader who took over was a huge nerd
The voice... I was interested in the video but i guess I won't be watching this
I actually thought a civil war was gonna happen in jungle and others were going to gain up in the jungle  I am really happy that desert won because they could agree in something.
ngl i was rooting for ize XD
the jungle did the right thing to attack the artic however they should not have went after the renements they should have regrouped burned the artic go back to the jungle create a trap and try to pincer them the king was good and smart in the first half but after the artic was brought down he just went crazy with bloodlust.. buuuut since the begining he was a bit bloodlusty.. not that that is nececerly bad but yea
That Ize guy from the nugle civilization is so annoying... he could never be a leader in any situation outside minecraft
rip starkiller
I just hate toxic people who are just jerks
Jungle hade a L king
Star reminds me of that mouse guy from hunter x hunter
a wise man once said.. “Pax in Bello”
You should make another server just like this except take away hardcore and allow more people to join it
The enchant table guy was soo annoying
even silver reminded squidkid he was 2nd in potatoes
Jungle army giving me nazi germany vibes
LONG LIVES DESERT
I NEED A SEQUEL
Arctic: OMG ITS A RAVAGER *KILL IT!!!*               AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  me and the bois on bedrock: o-o
The jungle king kinda acted like hitler
This kind of worked like ww2, the jungle kingdom being the nazis, arctic being the French and the desert being the uk.
Please come back to your other channel I’m really happy for your success I just wish you would upload again
Why is no one talking about how the Jungle guys made a killer move on the temple?
invasion ,my balls likeu  russi A  A
THIS IS IMPORTANT, AN ITALIAN YOUTUBER CALLED KENDAL STOLE YOUR THUMBNAIL AND CHANGED THE MODELS A BIT https://youtu.be/IX-fNaldM88
There is earthbound music noice
Ize was just full of arrogance. I was on the jungle side I would have pointed that out to the other players and tell them if that is the kind of leader they want.
2nd best potato farmer lol
Yo Silver, i made server called 'Ideology Craft' its 24/7 up message if ur interested by the way i do it :D
wtf jungle became nazi germany
The second you said genshin impact I went like FREE LIKE MY FAVORITE GAME and free primogems epic because I'm saving for raiden or kokomi cuz I lost the 50 50 to c1 Jean so a guaranteed 5 star because I already have yae miko so the next one and people who are deciding it's a good choice to download it it's so fun and there's gonna be a new region called sumeru and 3 available ones you start in monstadt and move to liyue and then there's these quests called arcon quests and you go to a place called inazuma but there's no other way to go there the hardest place to explore is probably a mountain I won't say much then it has snow and you can freeze and die because I dont want to give spoilers but there's so many characters people should really get it in my opinion I've been playing it a lot and the elements are pyro hydro geo anemo electro and cryo and soon Dendro coming with sumeru btw again this is my honest opinion btw should I get raiden or kokomi I have asked a few people so far raiden 3 people kokomi 2 people so 3 to 1 I'll probably update the comment of the score and note when it was made when it's done
The jungle king reminds me of Donald trump
Poor squid kid imagine your brand is being second place ;-;
do more of these
You did artic dirty
Please do another one
I was rooting for jungle until shit started to hit the fan. I dont see why people just go "hey lets start a war". Like you can tell what kind of person the king was by how he acted
desert was amazing and silver keep it up these are some of the best minecraft videos id ever watches thanks you!
chungledor sounds like a worse boris johnson
17:50 among us
"are 3 innocent peples lives to u content?" that was DEEP
Eeehm @cshn could you please like unmute me please
Bro I found the jungle king guy so annoying
Please do more and how can I get a chance to be part of the next one
god this guys accent is so annoying i can't watch it
This dude was like the admin from minecraft story mode S2
i thought that guy called lapis diamond
the arctic was easily the best looking town and the jungle place was just messy
When’s the next event and how can one be invited to play?
lol my team i chose acually won
I'm glad ize was elected as king, he did a good job leading his army
I was rooting for the desert kingdom was nice to see the annoying tyrant from jungle die
I LOVED the dessert
SUB TO TECHNOBLADE!
If i was in this i would have liked to be in the Arctic tribe and a miner.And i personally would have liked to be king and rule diplomaticlly,set some rules and lead my tribe into peace and harmony
Jungle team really fucked up
OOOOOOH THE SHADE ON SQUID KID DAAAANG
jungle guy like putin
25:05 ah yes caught off guard by a creeper gets killed by a phantom
It would've been interesting if one of the players could come up with some very good plans in advance to secure their nation and most importantly their people. The Arctic Nation for example, had that much opportunity. Despite their disadvantage of being located in a freezing cold terrain, it doesn't mean they cannot make better use of it. For example, the escape tunnel the general came up with could've been developped even greater. A better tunnel systems that linked between house to the dwarven fortress or to a bunker. And when the country's under attack for example, everyone would've been ready and they retreat in a well-mannered and organized way. This could have been a battle of attrition or a guerrilla warfare in a frozen area. In addition to the tunnel systems, I would've set up traps and ambushes under the snow or in the mountains, followed up with the scorched earth policy by burning down and detonate bombs in key areas in my territory or the village to slow down and kill the enemies without coming in contact with them. Or even crazier, carpet bomb the hell out of them (unless it's not allowed) General sUeP did his best as a military strategist, however it would've been better if both the Desert and Arctic nations made the best possible plans and countermeasures against the attackers. Because there will be always war and you cannot just win with conventional warfare.
There is no way in the world would these guys actually die the way they did in this video like dying to a zombie was pretty dumb. And I still can’t believe the jungle kingdom got first. Honestly sand kingdom was better
When you are fighting against desert noobs
The Jungle sounds like Nazi Germany.
I really love that potato war reference
idk why but this was extremely infuriating to watch, why was like every player so damn self absorbed lmfao
Ize seems like the exact copy of Napoleon from the book “Animal farm”
The best- second best potato farmer squid kid farmed potatoes  E M O T I O N A L       D A M A G E
WHO THA FACK HAVE USED WHITEBLIND ON DILUC
Necromency for the win
I prefer jungle sivilisation team (:
Awesome concept ! You should make more of these, but maybe with different rules so that we can see what human nature will lead the story!
Jungle should have won.
I think that the king of the jungle doesnt have friends he´s so stupid and irritating
ize is the one very very very un likeyble villian
The last words from last jungle king before executed by desert zombie warrior "have you heard of genshin impact"
So glad Desert team won, the Jungle dictatorship is over
I BEG MAKE THIS A SERIES I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS SO MUCH AND WITH YOUR COMENTATING ,it was amazing 🤩
Pls do another one ☮️
genshin impact booooooo!
I was rooting for jungle up until Star got his rights to live removed from the chat. It was then when I knew jungle was doomed to fail.  If you silence the competition who willingly stepped down and cooperated, you are looking at a government doing whatever it takes to accomplish something, which sometimes isn't wrong unless you throw others against whatever you may find just to satisfy some sort of overinflated ego. While winter's general (sounds cool that way) could have made a couple of smart choices along the way, I think it was a good ending for him, having at least avenged his people. Desert was the sleeping giant, the silent monster if you like. They minded their own business and played smart while jungle played hard. Both methods with their own merits, but maybe with a different leadership jungle would have made it. All in all, this was a sweet video and I liked that at least most people got what they deserved, both as in rewards and consequences.
So cool! Nice idea! Keep on!
Come back to hypixel skyblock!
Eyyyyy yowww new sub heree
Dude i wanna play this so bad this seems like so much fun
ize the jungle king, isthe most selfish person ive ever heard jesus im glad he died and lost
I love how Genshin Impact is seen as a legendary thing in this video it makes me not annoyed hearing about it
As  the  art of  war  say   The  country  who  start  the  wars has  already  lost
What do Alexander the Great and Winnie the Pooh have in common?    Their middle names.
Dude i cant wait for another video like this. Also i mostly like the ice kingdom. 2nd was the desert and the last was jungle.
Please make another one
its just a jungle difference 😂 ok ill leave bye
honestly i find ize the tyrant so toxic that i'm relieved he died
9:05 The jungle people didnt touch grass in real life
Bro did my Favorite Arctic village like that 😔
TAKE MY LIFE ,MY WATCH TIME AND MY SUBSCRIPTION
1st potato farmer wait I said that wrong I mean the 2ND potato farmer  aka im_a_squid_kid  Me: *WHEEZES*
You sound like squidward
Genshin I know that game. play it
I used to watch u when u had 20k
Jungle king is a chad
I'm still waiting for that one guy who legit isolate himself from everything to be found
I like that aritic
11:00 Ah yes, a democratically-elected king makes as much sense as being an autocratic leader in a "democratic" republic
Sliver you don't deserve to be on 1millon you deserve to be on 50 million
One of the best minecraft video I've ever watched. it's so cool
didnt know creepers could fly
Jugle was the best tbh
I don't know how jungle managed to win the building event even though the arctic were clearly more superior in terms of building.
been here since 10k so cool to see you grow your channel so much so fast ♥♥
Abeserec should be the king
I feel like the jungle kingdom's king has some Putin blood or something.
How did the zombie thing happen though?
Desert was the best
The jungle should of gone for desert first since they where the second strongest
9:03 genshin players not as crazed
Ye jungle king too arrogant.
I like the amogus country
The war tactics if the jungle nation are questionable
Eyes was a garbage king
THIS SHOULD BE A SERIES
That guy literally died promoting Genshin.
Sounds like you have a stuffed nose there
One of the best concept in minecraft😍😍
The zombie warrior haha
Literaaly jungle never know how to use its resources well unlike desert ( that somehow most of the time in every challlenge wins )
It's cool how these guys all created something alike a civilization heheh
Murder anything that move that isnt us.. Bruh
SQUID hey there buddy
dude what a perfect idea. this project have a potential to be in metaverst permenetly and having a whery good profit for all. the host. the players and even the mojang.
I love how squid kid is a farmer and uses potatoes
Desert kingdom 4l
WHOO I CAN FEEL MY POWER:MINECRAFT JUNGLE GUY
very good video
5:01 she saved him :makes slightly crying face:
If you want to win 'Do not attack first'
U should do more video like this
0:08 Palikka!
Do this again but this time with a swamp
I feel smart knowing that the ice kingdom lost the votes for building when every one else had random buildings everywere
This video was really entertaining. Favorite civilization was Desert because of the undead.
Killing the Among Us was 999 IQ Move🤣
yoo was rooting for the desert from the beginning happy that they won...
Subbing for more of this kinda content.
abstrekt took "My death was greatly exaggurated" to a whole new level
sheesh the dessert player that said gosh made me laugh LOL
Why would suep helped the leader of a nation that invaded his nation?
Now my favourite character is that zombie woh
if starkiller wasnt killed jungle wouldve won
Its really good I cant lie but this was a copy of many videos before it. Still a masterpiece tho👍
Three cheers for that jungle prick dude that wanted to murder his fellow tribes men for nk reason. Lied and betrayed everyone. Those people let bad people win. And blamed his people for his failures
We play genshin impact
Bruh this could have well been a 4 hour movie lol
I voted the desert I did not expect them to win
The jungle kingdom is what would happen if madara became the hokage instead of hashirama
I loved how during the jungle conquest part Liyue battle soundtrack plays.
Ice
Pls make Naruto civilisation with hokage as the king
I love the artic
Part 2 pls
the 2nd best potato farmer lol
Absolutely loved the Desert Civilization. The Jungle faction was just way too hostile and sweaty. Especially their tyrant of a king that would of started a civil war if Star didn't backdown. Glad the Sandom Warriors of the Desert won this.
Why they have to do that to the among us statue tho😂😭
I feel like Ize and star killer are a perfect yin and yang when it comes to leaders and organizing a nation. If only Ize took the crown but was only declared military General incharge of the warrior classes while star killer still remaining as president or leader in charge of the miners and famers to gather better resources like more diamonds and fortifying the jungle base. Then with Star killers people skills and having fun and lightening the mood for the builders and resource gatherers and Ize's Strategy of picking off the other nations one by one with his competive serious group everyone could have had a good time while maintaining a damn strong nation.  Both leaders had there strengths in weaknesses. After all there's bad in the good and good in the bad. ☯️
Pleeeease make more stuff like this!!!
Squeal please
Its like naruto
It was so good seeing Ize finally die.
jungle had an amazing leader but their villagers were snowflakes
3:50
NOT THE AMONG US STATUE BEING ASSASSINATED 😭😭😭
Arctic was best because - WHITE
Jungle
28:02  pov: you're invading Normandy beach.
Are u speedsilver the guy who play hypixel skyblock bc ur voice is the same
35:52, gosh. best part
your voice is insufferable
Happy the jungle king lost
It's a good video but is anyone gonna mention how he copied magicgum's thumbnail?
I mean Star killer spent the entire time actually leading his people whilst the other guy just did mining.
I dont even realize this video was about 40 minutes-
The Genshin impact fight music in the background 🔥🔥🔥🔥, amazing ✨
I liked this civilization video very much. Hoping for the new videos of this series very soon 🙂
12:07 pov:dday
The video was op❤
lol this trend is taking of I am an OG to this
i like how he said to squid kid second that brings me back to the potato war
just to think if everyone listened in the jungle nation they could of easily wiped both teams out.
I want u to make more video like this it amazing 🤩🤩
I would literally die right off the bat if I were there XD Not because I don't know how to play (Noob), but ngl I'm just a scaredy cat in mc, literally sprinning for their life when they encountered a zombie XD
Jungle is like north korea rn
I hated iez the entire time bruh
I like how all the music for the regions is  just Mario music
This was like a Stanford prison experiment thing
I wish i can join but im bedrock edition but thanks!
new civilization:tech civilization
It infuriates me to know the guy who did it for himself won king yet the dude who did things for others nonstop didnt dude litterally just showed up day before elections and said let me be king
jungle army lost during election
Honestly jungle could of won if they didn’t just only have fighting on their minds they didn’t hostages, cutting off food sources, bribes just fighting didn’t try to make an alliance
this reminds me of 1800's
The jungle kind was a complete loser who probably gets no girls and sits in a basement all day on Reddit. Anyway loved the video
This tells us alot about society and it’s future
oh god most this is genshin music
Wibu games A.K.A genshin impact
I seriously want to join as a nether guy where I sell potions to the other kingdoms, or just do my own thing and join the first group that finds me
Is this a real life month or an in-game month
I really didnt expect genshin impact sponsor havent been watch ur video for 1 year cuze school and etc
The jungle got a little toxic during king choosing
This is better than that dream SMP series
Obviously jungle king was the best ruler
idc what y'all say.. ezi is the best leader in Minecraft history
STARKILLER NOOOO!!!!!
Ize kind of disappointed me
It was so cute to see the arctic region singing Christmas carols and playing games! 😂
I was rooting for suep and the Arctic nation
We need a part 2!! Woooo! Amazing video!
5:50 WOOHH I CAN FEEL MAH POWEHH 9:07 GENSGIN IMPACT YEAH BBYY
This is kinda accurate thats why I like it
If I were the jungle king, I'd create designated points for each class. this allows warriors to patrols the outskirts of the village, as well as the inside, and they will have the best armor because an invasion would be inevitable. In the case another village tries to invade, I'd tell all the farmers to get as far away as possible and send coordinates after 1 Minecraft day. that way, if the invasion succeeds, the miners and farmers can start over. During the blood moon, I'd have everyone inside  their houses and have them save as much food as possible for the 5 days. after the blood moon, I can send a single soldier, farmer, and miner to the opposing villages, and have them ask for refuge. if they are killed, I know the enemy is hostile against other villages. if not, I can send more and more soldiers to the village and form an alliance. little do that know, I plan on killing all of them, if need be. the other king and I will set up an invasion plan to another village. we will send half of our combined forces there, and wait for a response. we would need some soldiers in the village to keep watch. after the attack, assuming it is a success, the 2 remaining villages can live together in peace, until someone, sooner or later, decides to start a war...
This is actually insane, can you do a part 2?!
WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND SONG AT 13:53 I NEED TO KNOW
I mean like for real this is the best thing i’ve watched in a few years on youtube very nice man great work ❤️
“You’ve been here talkin em up like you’re Jim Jones for 40 minutes” lmaoooo that one was good
Jungle
No way abstrekt HAHAHA
the jungle king was so much like a dictator which is why they failed
No bc I loved the Arctic kingdom 😭😭 I feel kinda bad and I heavily disliked the new jungle leader, like yeah good leadership and overall skill but his personality was just so icky :/
The Jungle were to high over heels as they might have been prepared but not smart
I liked the jungle
Honestly, I’m not a big fan of Ize, I was hoping he’d be revolted against. He was being a real jerk. I’m glad he lost. GO DESERT!
i hated the jungle king man he sucks
Pea? Nut? Butt? Er????
Basically a rise of kingdoms add.
I'm a squid kid from techno blade 😱🤓🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔
Jungle was on the right track at the beginning but they got too greedy, while they were fighting the others were getting stacked so they could in fact compete the best thing to do is to kill a nation and then regroup and go for netherite.
MAKE MORE but there is a traitor in each team :D
ice
I want to fight that ize guy in real life. He was an asshole the whole time and kinda deserves an ass kicking.
''i dont wanna fight any big teams rn'' *LITERALLY 2 SECONDS LATER* 17 guys show up "oh my god-"
11:00 ah yes because a king is elected lol I just find that funny
honestly, i wanted the jungle kingdom win
Ize is Kim jong Yun irl lmfao
That jungle king deserves the worst, absolute worst kind of human.
Bro I watched the whole thing and I realized at the end that this vid was 40 minutes long
If you think about it the one person that talk about the other leader of the jungle might have been the one soup killef
Sigh i was indeed rooting for arctic
This is just Russia and Ukraine
Jungle King was stupid he atacked on Blood mood
When he started talking about genshin impact I just skipped
The jungle king is definitely is a sociopath
down with the jungle tyrant
Loved the video
POV: This video is unsponsored by rise of kindoms
The supply drop was unfair literally artic deserves first place. Wtf
pretty sick video, but I feel something like this would be even more awesome if there were some tech or magic mods or so
Okay but squid kid being a potato farmer and Silver narrating squid as “the best potato farmer- wait I read that wrong- second best potato farmer..” is the funniest thing I’ve heard all day.  When I posted this it said 11,999 comments, so I guess that makes me 12,000th. Yay!
Ok
Techno blade "you lose squid kid. Watch me dance"
Genshin impact is for edp fans
The Arctic region was so weak because it was filled with genshin impact players and Women
SEQUEL!
This man must have the oddest accent ever. Its mad annoying
Me when someone mentions Genshin Impact: 9:08 P.S. This content great, Silver. Keep up with the hard work.
The fact that what they did in the game is real and that is kinda scary
Make another I wana see jungle destroy artic and get revenge :)
wow
the second best potato farmer
Everyone in this vid is blind it seems like
This video was seriously a master piece.   This is the kind of stuff that inspires me to try something like that too! I would be so excited for a sequel, and I bet everyone else would be too 👏 👏
Ize is annoying and should worry more about potatoes. Jacksepticface sounding leprechaun.
I liked the desert the best
Arctic
jungle leader was right they should have listened'
all hail the susmas tree!
I loved the Jungle at first. But when the other bully came and took the crown by force (going all alone to gear up for him self, acting all nice and bribing the people to vote him, then assassinate the old Leader and lastly forcing the members of his civilisation to fight) I hated Jungle. I was all for Ice but they died so im glad that desert won
This is better than game of thrones😂😂😂
I liked ice on the start,cuz first leader was very peaceful,and same with Jungle
If they had picked starkiller as king they would have won Iysz or whoever they where was dumb he really thought he did something
There are jungle villages!?
"murder everything that moves that isn't us" eren yeager!?
Yooo desert wins!    *I hate the jungle leader*
rest in peace arctic kingdom. Screw suep tho.
The forest is Russia right now
Why does Yae Miko Look like a female version of technoblade fan art? 3:20
The fact you said “oh wait the 2nd best potato farmer” is hilarious
Every long wait is worth it because of how dedicated and skilled Silver is. Mad props.
Pliz pu download map
You didn't have to do squid kid like that
When Minecraft Became reality
this was epic :D
(35:52) gosh
The minor: they dont care about real life rules
i hate with everything the king of jungle
My favourite civilization was the Artic because of how cheerful they were! But how dare u giving them a very slim chance to win! But all is good🐕💛🧡💛💛
I was rooting for jungle until Ize became leader then I rooted for desert.
I wished Jungle had won they put up such an amazing show. Their king was cocky but it was perfect to lead a good Civilization with all the little plot twist. I hope there are more videos like this. Great job good video. Huge respect.
The video: 😀 The sponsor: 🤮
Even the Legend Squid kid is here xD
Man forget the other comments I was rooting for the jungle from the beginning
This may be a little harder, but I'll see if I can do a kill count for this.  1:22 DashingPrune didn't realize there was a slight drop and fell from a high place. 2:35 Zoomzane4 was slain by Enderman. 2:35 JynxTheKitsune was slain by Enderman. 4:38 EpicDimples fell from a high place. 4:41 PSTDminecart starved to death. 4:42 Zhibo was slain by Zombie. 4:42 __Jadow__ starved to death. 5:02 inevitability was blown up by Creeper. 5:59 Winner8813_ starved to death. 7:33 Moonlapse was slain by Snowman. 15:12 Schnuffles was slain by Zombie. 17:21 abstrekt died and was reanimated. 20:52 tot__tots was slain by Ravager. 20:55 Beqins was slain by Ravager. 21:01 Tyecar was slain by Ravager. 25:07 Infernally was slain by Phantom. 25:23 StarKiller98K was slain by RobbieMcFly. 26:41 waverlyguy was blown up by Creeper. 26:41 Noctah was blown up by Creeper. 26:46 Screeebs died. 28:07 Vectaury died. 28:39 Gynii died. 28:58 Canadian__Gamer died. 30:04 FusionBridge died. 30:05 Ilex__ died. 30:11 Fontenelle was slain by 5aitama. 30:13 Shady_Oak was slain by lumyu. 30:21 childCHOMPER was slain by wfk.
I was rooting for jungle
Ok couldn't stand the jungle leader I would have left after we was king 😂 good riddance to him 😂
Others: just taking a minute to show viewers the sponsor Silver: GUYS JUMP IF YOU LIKE GENSHIN IMPACT
broooo the artic had the best city by far
The irish guy from the jungle temple was such an idiot lmao
I don't like any war but that game so good
I loved the Arctic Nation
YESSSS
I haven’t finished watching it yet but I think desert will win
glizzy
Jungle they are POWER
Ize is a bad king. Only thinks about himself
Why is this not on Netflix?
Desert is the worst BROOO
SO GOOOD MAKE ANOTHER VID PLSSS
This is a super creatful Minecraft video, I freakin love it, keep it up dude even tho i just saw you for the first time
My opinion on each of them:  Artic: very well planned escape routes lacked military strength. Had the best vibes tho lol Desert: I think they were the luckiest out of the 3 as the weren't invaded first. Would love to see what would've happened if jungle calmed their tactics and attacked with discipline.  Jungle: I think their king deserved his election he just needed to stay calm and they would've won. Overall I think if the jungle accepted him more and had willingly done so they might have had a different outcome. The internal tensions of starkiller did not help jungle make the best decisions post artic invasion.
wow, such well made video deserves much more attention. i loved the snow civi, they were the super chill guys
I started watching you when u were 230k around maybe but not now u r in millions really happy for ur success best of luck for future
They should organize better militarly, making traps and unified attacks
Ay Nes was there
hate that jungle didn't win
Imagine if Silver and Captainsparklez were able to collab to make "100 players simulate civilization (Mianite Edition). I would hype for that!!
2:21 was I the only one who got the joke LMAO
The king is like dio and soup is like cream, he’s pretty loyal
that jungle man who denying the king so much is so annoying ngl
My favorite is jungle king
Great vid as usual, but please if possible could u link the mods u use thnx
Wtf. Starkiller was better than that ego tyrant xd
Pls do sequal
Do more pls
Never trust a weird guy as the forest king he's an idiot
deserve i hate the jungle king
If techno joined he already killed 4 people in 1 hour
I'm glad the jungle nation didn't win
I would love to watch more or be in one of these videos!
Finna start Russia vs Ukrainian
What about 1000 days please I promise to sub
even in death absrekt zombie will kills his enemies in his own corpse
Why does this remind me of rise of kingdoms
2:23 Technoblade reference ahahahaha
This is 1 of the coolest things ive ever seen in mc please make more of these
this feels like egyptian history but it is not related to anything that ever happened
BRO  plz do this again plzzzz its soooo enjoyable
dear silver i wasnt been in youre world but i like your videos i feel bad for you but im subbing
Please Make More Of These!! Plz!
If starkiller lived he will let kindom win
Rip starkiller
Jungle civ lose because the King was too desperate to win. He should've come back home heal up or take POW from the arctic civ to team up with them.
Your videos are super good, i like them
Hi silve
Hey silver will you ever make videos about hypixel skyblock ?
I like this content
The jungel Kingdom shuld have won
You should do this but with a civilization for each part of trixyblox's new massive reaction of mc world
can you say multiplayer again
"Wait,I said that wrong 2nd best potato farmer" I really went *yEahh tEcNao* 💀
hypixel skyblock when
the jungle group would have won if it wasnt for that loser who ran away
Imagine losing as the last one from your nation and the last thing you hear before dying is "Have you heard of genshin impact?"
So dumb raging against the desert. They shoud've expected the ice and desert being allies so they coud invade the desert capital through the jungle side, the desert was either meeting the ice guys or defending the ice side of their capital. They just destroy all of their resources, destroy the capital and then strategize an attack while the desert was still recovering
Yes make more this type of video
This is like actual politics
Started throat singing when I saw the ice pyramid.
Jungle deserved to win
so basicly, minecraft but its Sword Art Online
anyone else noticed the genshin combat music?
Why do i have the feeling that i'd hear david attenborough's voice documenting this.
pls make a sequel to this
Dessert
made 200 Players, THIS IS EPIC
The jungle could have won
This was better than most nerfilx shows
That guy tried to betray his king and got recked. Yeah. F*** that guy...
Yo i thought jungle will win
Way better than game of thrones.
We needddddd thissss moreee feedd my addictionnnn
Jungle is the one im rooting for bruh
watching movie XD
Honestly i liked soup i Was sad wenn he die
Jungle army is my fav
I was soooooo happy when ize got killed, I really didn’t like him
The jungle army is legit Russia
Noooo!!! Schnuffles :(
I like the jungle the fight for there life's and others Thanks Jungle
The best vid ever
I play in tlauncher pizz make it cracked
i really liked jungle
after i see the junglekill the artic i was like salute to the artic
Ngl I was kinda rooting for those remaining Arctic to win
This is unironically, the best minecraft content I have ever watched in my opinion... slightly better than MrBeast's version
jungle king is worst guy ever...his parents teaches him no manner and he is a worst mean guy......starkiller is the best..VOTE FOR STARKILLER
And I hate when they kill starlight
Rip to the first player die
If only i had enough people to also do this
My most favorite is desert nation: they are they most creative. Zombie is just awesome.  2nd is jungle. They are dramatic. Every story need a villain, it's them.  3rd place is arctic. I can't say anything good or bad about them: if I want mediocrity, I always can refer to the mirror.
More videos like this please
Dude, you could atleast credit magic gum for the idea, you even copied his thumbnail
Ahm, a quote for all Gundam fans describing Ize: Gihren: "We've reduced the human population. We will then maintain these numbers with the superior races. It's the only way man can finally attain everlasting peace. And it can only be done by controlling people through the Zabi family dictatorship."  Degwin: "Gihren.... are you familiar with.... Adolf Hitler?"  Gihren: Hitler? You mean, from the Middle Ages."  Degwin: "Yes. A dictator, completely out of touch with the rest of the world. You seem… to be following … in his footsteps."  Gihren: "Is that so?"  Degwin: "I established the Principality to quickly unite the Zeons and make the Zeon ideal a reality. But now…"  Gihren: "Hitler's follower has managed to lead the nation into a dictatorship."  Degwin: "Together with Kycilia."  Gihren: "Yes. Just as with the Federation, a democracy will only promote weakness. People will only end up destroying each other. As they have done so in this war. I'll be victorious. See for yourself how a Hitler follower fights this war. I depart, to take my command at A Boa Qu."  Degwin: "Bah. Don't forget that Adolf Hitler was defeated."
Blitzkriek jungle lol
This is actually great but it is kinda strange where Minecraft civilisations have to be formed?
Why this is Sooo Simillar to Magicgum's Video?
Never knew that genshin impact's liyue theme would perfectly fit in Minecraft
Copyright
Me wanting to celebrate Genshin Impact v2.5:  :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))  Me remembering Genshin Impact isnt available for my device:  :llllllllllllllllllllllll :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((      *WHY*
I wanted to artic team win
Honestly thx god jungle lost their kings ego was out of the fucking roof
Nice touch with the Genshin Impact fighting music! Such a fun video.
This was very great to watch. Well done to everyone 👍 If you want to read my opinionated analysis on the reasons for victory & failure u can Read below. Spoilers below:  All the civilizations did very well in building, strength, and teamwork. Arctic being the most creative, Jungle having the most strength & Desert having the best Team work mind. However,  Jungle's team made the unfortunate mistake in leadership. Strength comes a long way, but it's worth nothing without team work & a good leader & I'm sorry to say Ize was not a good leader. The difference between a good leader is one who uses the word "We" instead of "I". Once he was leader I sadly felt jungle would not succeed. Once they attacked Arctic they became the aggressors. Now because of the brutal surprise attack and ill prepared Artic troops, this cost Arctic the win with little fault of their own. However this forced the artic to have a small alliance with desert against a single foe.  With the alliance, the element of surprise gone, & the Teamwork of the desert, jungle was surely to lose a 2nd immediate assault. The Desert had a clear advantage with a strong team mind, home turf, knowledge of an attack & Arctic alliance. Jungle made the mistake of looking to one to do all the damage instead of strengthening everyone's ability as a whole & it was Ize who made the mistake to boast, thinking he could do it all, & thinking mostly of his own power instead of his team's. He was just in the wrong position, top soldier, general, or best of all military supplier would have probably been better, but based on his personality & aggressive need for power he ruined his chance to be a good leader for his team. Especially when his first reaction of difference of opinions is immediate execution. This story actually follows similar paths throughout history which I find very cool. As the saying goes those who fail to learn history is doomed to repeat it. so based on past historic events logically jungle was doomed to fail based on poor leadership. In summary Jungle failed due to leadership issues, Arctic's chance of winning was destroyed in a surprise attack, and all this gave Desert the tactical advantage to win as a Team. This was just my opinionated analysis with the small knowledge I have & everyone did well with what they had.   All in all very entertaining, hope everyone had fun, & great work to everyone involved. Keep up the hard work 👍.
The Zombie turning into a secret weapon was great lmao.
I know the jungle king gets bullied in school bro literally needs to shut up
I don’t like how he keeps interfering with the civilizations, it should be more hands off and him just watching and time lapsing it for the most part
The rise and downfall of jungle felt like something i've seen before like maybe something out of WW2. A tyrannical dictator that rules with an iron fist, assassinates opponents, and reckless, militaristic policies. It was poetic how he died in the most pathetic way which was the undead.
I love the zombie so much
I like how Silver used genshin inpact Liyui combat music in the background of the video, nice touch how you are sponsored by genshin inpact👍👍👍
Squid kid is nr 2
Squid gets trolled again
Props to techno
It was a big mistake not to choose spirit as leader of jungle
the jungle king is cocky asl, he's not even good at pvp
jungle king was such an asshole i would’ve just killed him
bruh the artic literally made me smile they had a ski  side which makes it very fun to live there and very friendly people + it has the most gamergirls which are rare to find def going for artic if i had a chance to join edit:  i hate u ize go kxys 2nd edit: YO WHY U KLL EFF5IVE BRO HE HATES IZE HE COULDVE HAD JOINED ARTIC 3RD EDIT: Jack was the only one left, the guy who built the carrot farm respect
I like the Jungle King's leadership and bravery, but man this guy's super toxic
My conclusion after watching this video:  Artic civilization: Cool   Jungle civilization: Wild  Dessert civilization: deserted
bro next video you make of the civilization series inform first and also tell the server name please because i also wanna join thats why. 🙏
I loved the Jungle liked their approach to just fight even if it got them killed in the end if they all had just agreed to fight they might have actually won in the end
Love the content keep it up
Ukraine be like
My thoughts when I saw code for primos: Yay free primos P.S this is cuz i have ar 50
Despite Ize being cocky and a tyrant he was the perfect antagonist, ngl i was cheering for the jungle village by how powerful and strategic they are, ize honestly did well he just didn't have a back up plan for his invasion.
I really appreciate your work bro making these coustom getting this much people and making us feel about the ancient time just awesome bro😇
Jungle should win desert just lose
Man the Jungle "KING" is just tyrant... What is he a reincarnation of NAPOLEON?  He's like invading MOSCOW with starve army...  in this case he's invading the arctic with unloyal army.
Snow should have won the town supply drop
PLEASE DO MORE LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I'M REALLY INTO MINECRAFT NOW!!!!!
StarKiller is deserved king tbh
Lol the Mario music
This was amazing, we definitely need more!
LMAO even the amogus got killed
Abstrekt solos
The amount of effort you put into your videos is insane 🤯 I'm excited to watch this! 😁
Iza was trash
We want more of this pls 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 it's so sick 🔥
nice bro
"the cow was assassinated by a mystery player"  Lol
Just me or is the jungle kingdom really easy to hate
Lol he brought up the ancient Great Potato War.
:O G E N S H I N
As a Genshin addict I loved the use of Genshin music throughout the video :)
He's Sliver Surfing his Way To 2 Mil!
That music brought back some real memories
this was a whole movie had me excited as fuck amazing video
21:00 'silver killed 3 people' it did make good content -silver  he was right tho
I enjoyed the jungle kingdom, they overthrew a coward of a king to put in a war hungry yet smart king who make this so interesting
200kth like yes
Jungle king is insane
I liked jungle best
Jungle people stupid in the first place rather than unity they just doing useless thing but its make the video became more fun to watch.  If i was the jungle King i will take my time build my army and let some people to scout other kingdom as long they approach perimeter of jungle kingdom i will ambush them.  but if nobody attack i just grow my army first then strike when i see some war going on between other kingdom
woo
This was so captivating and 😎
This was fun to watch, if you ever consider making a sequel, I suggest you include 1 more nation , making the player count for each region 25
''2nd Best potato farmer.'' Man squid kid never gets a break.
That was very fun to watch  The Desert team was cool to see, they were chill, the zombie helping his team was hilarious, same goes for the Arctic team, it was pleasent to see them. Then there is the Jungle team, at first it was nice but when Ize got the power all went bad, his way of threathening everyone was so wrong, he had the gear, the brute force but no strategy, no intelligence, suxh a douchebag in his behavior  I hope to see more of this concept, could be fun to see a team that build a fortress in the temples, using the mobs spawner as soldiers, like if the Jungle team needed to atttack the players + the NPC they wouldn't went that far I think. Setting traps could help, there was someone with so much TNT, they could have placed it somewhere and in case of attack retreat to the place, the attackers would follow them to kill everyone, and when every ennemis are at the same place (inside a temple for example) ignite the TNT, they are then either dead or very low in health   As I say, EXPLOOOSIOOOON is the answer in case of agression
I desire more
Desert had really amazing builds honestly and it fit well with their biome. When I saw those builds I was already hoping for them to win
We need more
Ize is a dictator
StarKiller was such a good leader, and would have made an amazing King for his Jungle nation. It's unfortunate that he died soooo misteriously... 👀 But no hate for Ize. He and Saitama were great as antagonists, made for some interesting war action! Arctic people were so sweet <3 RIP sussy red baka on the hill... And obvi congrats to The Desert for winning!
5:03 thanks for the shoutout!
This didnt age well
man make the sequel its so fun to watch
i love how you put the liyue battle music in the background
That one green text kid sucking off star killer and trying to betray jungle (and was ultimately killed by artic) was so fucking annoying that was a satisfying execution to watch
You should do something like this again once trixyblox's ultimate survival world is finished.
Can players on mobile join ?
We just know we all hate that cocky jungle king
Mad respect for Abstrakt(?), Even after death still remains a true chad and patriot to his sandy nation.
It would have been so perfect if Izzy would have told them that he stole all the loot in the temple and his friend KILLED their past leader
I miss the artic, they were my favorite tbh…
Jack had that confidence to 1v11, and that's absolute respect.
This is why you don't start wars in such a fashion, if Jungle kingdom didn't jump into being warmongering idiot's and instead done more preperations and decided to actually PLAN an actual invasion with no escapees, they could've done so much more and won. But no, mr take charge chad, decides to just storm the Artic like he's going to win because of gear. They should have stopped after taking the Artic and built traps, restock on gear and resources, and could have even formulated an actual plan to take the desert kingdom. But no, had to let all that power get to him and charge in like a big headed chump. Starkiller would have been a better leader.
I loved the ice one
Need higher player amounts lol
GENSHIN MUSIC!
I’m glad the desert win I wished the arctic won they were so innocent but they lost and the jungle was just ruthless nothing happy to be about I would call the jungle North Korea
This is cool ^^ I wanna do this
I liked arctic the most
the genshin bg is on spot ! sooo cool !!
Why did the arctic guy team with jungle at the end??
I been looking for this content in this way like 5-6 years,this clip you nailed it please do more i really love  this
the Genshin music is fire
Artic vitu was The best
I wanted the Jungle to win so badly. I was glad when StarKiller failed in being king. I was glad when he was killed. I was glad when Ize and his forces slayed the Arctic kingdom. I wasn't glad when I realized that there was no hope left.
I would like too see more of this Content
This is what I’ve always wanted to do but never thought possible
I’ve seen this type of video before, this is really good! Keep it up, I loved it. 😀
I play genshin impact at 45
i liked desert
this is the by far the best video ive seen in my entire life man, just gimme the 2nd part
The Jungle King got what he deserved. Ruling through fear and uniting a nation under conquest is never the right way to lead a nation. Tyrants never die from natural causes.
Glad jungle lost
The zombie of the player that died to quicksand giving his all to his national is just amazing especially since he attacked the strongest king and killed his replacement
the jungle king was too annoying 🤢
The Polar Bears, The Poison Dart frogs, and the Desert scorpions.
I love this kind of shit in Minecraft challenges! Hell yeah!
The zombie on desert team wasn't even a warrior. He was an executioner.
The fact that the artic player still helped jungle king at the end even though the king destroyed there kingdom
You had a similar idea to a Chilean🇨🇱 youtuber called Aradir...Curiously similar🤨 Greetings from Costa Rica!😎👍🇨🇷
i love the tecno vs squid kid reference. ps i’m a youtuber subscribe 😎
Your thumbnail is a completely a ripoff of magic gum
23:02 That background music got me nervous for the players because I know what it means—
bruh I don't like the jungle king. he was too annoying as a leader. he was going to kill one of his own for some assault
RIP Starkiller, a great diplomat, never to be forgotten
34:50 Idiot
The downfall of Ize was very nice to see!
More of these videos
Your a real one with the genshin code, thanks! :D
Please make more of these
I LOVE THE JUNGLE THEY WHERE S O COOOOOOOOOL I WANT TO MEET IVES ONE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Lawson
Man was just narrating the Russo-Ukrainian conflict whenever anyone was fighting lmao
Enjoying fame and wealth built on ish's idea?
Damn, only the second best potato farmer? Summoning: T E C H N O B L A D E
I love this video! Ong please don't stop making them ❤️
This is why warmongers never win...
Rise of kingdoms?
Jungle kingdom had the advantage but lacked in leadership
Do they have games like this without a YouTuber that I could play?
The part where the jungle team killed the among us character got me rollin
i liked artic
It is sad to see Jungle civilization go from amazing to being lead by a tyrant
love it do it again
Genshin Impact is a money hungry gacha game
That "inevitability" player saved 3 people from getting blown up, noble sacrifice. 5:00
Jungle Civilisation is like Wakanda, StarKiller is like T'Challa and Ize is like Erik Killmonger
YOU GOTTA DO A SEQUEL!
Wait the zombie was like in god mode multiple people tried to hit him but it did not work
And one punch man himself
At the start I saw lots of yts
How did he drop the sharp 3 sword?
All other nations (before jungle came): Peace. Jungle: *WAR*
Awesome video. I love the concept so much!
They all like genshin? They must be pedos.
All this dudes are so unsympathetic its incredible.
Awesome
who else say xNestorio’s name at 0:09?
jungle king is noob, everyone should've ganged on him
Ah no I was rooting for the jungle
your  sus silver
Ah yes genshin impsct liyue harbor music?
Now I wait for the sequel: taiga vs  Mesa vs mountains
Ize is kinda annoying he had only 2 reasons why he should be king Both reasons weren’t even that good and   Ngl if I was on jungle and being forced to fight I would ditch them lol, I can’t hate on Ize to much he had to do what he had to do. If the other guy became king they wouldn’t have been able to attack the Artic. Ize made it more entertaining.
I didn’t need the sponsor but thanks for the code I didn’t know thrat lol
This is the best civilization vid ever made. Absolutely perfect
"Murder everything that isn't us" And that is when the panic set in that they may not win this.
Fuck that jungle king!!
Best part of the vid was when genshin impact oh yeah baby guy came to say that
More pls
Lol potato war vibes
Jungle is so dum TBH they could of killed IZe and  gave star his wrmrr
le monke
I liked the artic the most… after they died i was rooting for desert
The jungle king is a fucking truant
I’m so sad, I was rooting for the Artic 😭😭 I thought their spirit was awesome, also I’m subscribing now because this was entertaining for me
They did the arctic bad, imo they had the best town and the desert had the worst
Crazy how how fast Silver got subs,  I remember seeing his first video ever that did great view wise, but he only had like 30k subs. I knew from there on that he was gonna pop off of minecraft YT
Great content, keep posting…lov it.
"And quickly planned an attack against the natives" Britain: THERE IS ANOTHER
i hate the jungle president
hey i like genshin tooo yoooo
seed?
I'd vote Starkiller
duh this aint fair the zombie literally killed like 4 of them jeez actually make ur vids good and fair instead of giving the op as hell people god advantages
Genshin impact is: a game that takes all my gigabytes
Peace- Ucrânia, War- Rússia
Arctic should’ve won the building competition
According to my understanding of Machiavelli, Jungle leader was a good leader. According to my morals, he was a douche.
i kinda wanted arctic to win...
You kinda stole this from Spoke but good vid
Desert
Arctic
pls do more I loved this
Fun Fact: This Map was made by TrixyBlox
The jungle was my favorite
pls make one more
shit not the among us
This was a really good video, enjoyed it!
nooooooo
amn i loved the artic i hated teh jungle
Ah, a Genshin ad. “Gain control of 7 different elements” I’m gonna stop you right there chief, you obviously don’t play the game cause the game has no Dendro characters yet.  How can you shell for a game and not even play it?
Damn the most boring nation won that’s not fun :/
Now What the 🦆 uck is squid kid doing here
The second best potato farmer
Jungle king is Putin
Nerf miner 🗿🗿🗿
When your team starts screaming at you for an enchanting table you know your going to lose.
5:01 Man's sacrificed himself. Respect💯
Watching that Ice player die made me happy, he kinda had a Hitler feeling to me
Jungle town was highkey kinda ass
it seems that basically, the jungle civilisation is no one's favorite civilisation.
For everyone saying how they didn't like Ize in this video, somebody had to be the villain and he was fucking perfect for it 😁 he took power from an otherwise fairly peaceful kingdom and destroyed a neighboring kingdom before crumbling under the weight of his own success, what a character arc 😂
I have to say Ice was one of the more entertaining characters in this lore.
Is it Java or bedrock
How do I play
Make another
I honestly like the arctic nation.
Jungle was the one I was rooting for, but I'm glad that desert won since arctic were too soft and weak (exept the government in exile with soup)
I hate the jungle leader💩
thank go desert's compatriotism won over jungle's tyranny
I made 100 Kids simulate*
One of my favorite Minecraft videos ever. Well done!
was surprised with genshin sponsor but what more surprising is the genshin battle music  edit: 9:07 lmao this dude
That zombie should have been king
your video are always at the best of all and thanks once again for introducing me to Mrs victory Anderson if not for you won't be out of my debt issue ✝️✝️
#nowarinukraine
The fact that arctic town was voted the worst is a crime.
what the hell the artic civilization was the best one and most organized why they lost base building?
The jungle civilization lost bcoz of his king, that was an absolute stupid king
pp tower
why was i so invested minecraft war arc went hard
This is dope keep up the work man.
stonks
Please make another one
Please make another one
Please make another one
Silver imaging copying magic gums thumbnails.
More pls
Please make one with a lot of people and make an event where there is forced war between all tribes a lot of people = 150+
Last time I watched silver he was on 30k subs
JUNGLE is the BeST
the among us tower
geeeez!
Jungle king is probably what I'd do too. Take power and declare martial law
I think the Arctic build was the best build Other than that AMAZING 🤯
Eyes is evil
I love the artic civilization. The singing was the best.
When villagers are born be like:
the chillz of minecraft
When you are a Zombie  with almost no weapon but armour with sheer willpower and strength obliterated 2 of Jungle Kingdom's  powerful holders
i really liked the arctic empire
jungle
Of course Squid Kid choose Farmer. Forever number 2. I love the arctic.
Jungle were such morons. Guy spends days getting them diamonds and an enchant table and they blow him off, accuse of being a noob and exile. Becomes King and then they don't follow his orders. He forces them into a dominating victory and two of them still defected. Jungle were such whiny babies
I like how the last person was peacefully roaming around the jungle without a single thought in his head.
Respect to Suep for the effort he lasted so long
This is literally Dune
I really dont like ize
YESSSS LETS GO DESERT
I like the Arctic
Fun Fact: Ich habe Popcorn gesehen, als ich das hier gesehen habe, und ich komme aus der Schweiz, wie wir es immer während der Weltkriege getan haben.

The Desert nation lived happily ever After...         Until a Drowned God killed everyone for Revenge...
Good intro
SLIVER IS AMZIMNG
SLOVER IS AWESOME
Even in death the desert will prevail
I liked the snow kingdom the most, sad that it got distroyed
I love that he used Genshin Impact sounds as background music. :)
If jungle wasn’t so cocky and think he could kill all and got more gear he could’ve won
Commenting this half way though.  Scre Ize, hope he loses
I was rooting for the Jungle kingdom, but Ize just got too cocky in the end, which led to the end.  The Desert for sure deserved the win.
2:19 geez- that was just, wow.     that hurt
The helmets in the thumbnail look like Mandalorian helmets
The jungle kingdom’s leader was too cocky and his decision to go after the desert and arctic wasnt a good choice he should’ve retreat after massacring the artic
Made 200 players play 8 civilizations
… There is a war right across the ocean for me! I don’t want to get bomb-
Lowkey Ize was so annoying
I liked the arctic kingdom, they didn't deserve it.
tldr; abstrakt is a god
Imagine if mrbeast did the same thing but with dream and others?
R.I.P Starkiller he was my favorite
Sequel Sequel
Bro, why not just make an actual public server, like this, it would be so much fun
Idea : receive event : -vote one of [x] civilization dead player back to alive
So good to see that POS Ize eat it. Toxic AF and a terrible leader.
If you do make a sequel can I play in it?
How does someone join and take part in these Minecraft civilization videos?
Even in death he still serve
Dessert team
If killer would have survived the jungle would have won since they would have used the deserts tactics
Ize from the jungle kingdom was an asshole
Idk how you would do this (and I love the videos) but it feels like there's no reward for being warlike/proactive ever, despite the effort jungle put in. This is because of gear caps in mc. Maybe find a way to implement territory and food as more important resources and allow population growth as this would be the reward. Idk how that would be done though
I was extremely bored and this video made me laugh so much 😂
This video gave me terraria calamity vibes (Yharim the jungle tyrant)
They should have not chosen eyes
we need one more of these videos
Thats amazing content right here
This was so Good I hope you make more like this.
LIKE a great man once said : the best attack is patience, the best defense is patience
LIKE a great man once said : the best attack is patience, the best defense is patience
the king of the jungle lowkey reminds me of hitler and more recently putin 0-0
Arctic was best
Yeah...  I think this is a bad moment to upload this...
Dude this vid is epic
Umm techno blade is the best potato farmer
desert
Plsss back to hypixel sky block
Jungle kingdom was so close winning
F to pay respects two arctic
Bro I hate the desert Kingdom it looks disgusting
jungle got what they deserved they were all so dumb to have a civil war
discord?
I have a dream that one day, Minecraft civilizations would end without some bloodthirsty maniacs taking over factions and slaughtering each other
Bro the Jungle King 😭
I Love YouTubers who do the sponsors at the end or at the beginning when things don't get interesting. I just wish there were more YouTubers like thosr
wow what an original video. Totally wasnt copied from MagicGum at all
no linux?
I screamed when i heard "world of teyvat" LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO
Such a successful masterpiece bro!Can’t imagine how much effort u put on this video.Just love so freaking much.I’m really looking forward to part 2 with a more massive scale.
The genshin music in the background is great
I have a suggestion for the Civilisation game based off of the sid mires games.  I don't know if this is even possible.  But let me know what you think.   At the end of each session, before you close the server, you let people vote on which Tech to unlock.  Domestic animals don't spawn on the server unless Animal Husbandry is picked.  Iron, Gold, Dimond Etc Ore texture is replaced with stone. Technically you Can mine them, but they're practically invisible to the player until Iron workings, currency etc is unlocked.  Border expanse beyond the ocean is unlocked with the Navigation tech.  Buckets are got via Aquaduct tech. I can imagine them building the structure, then when You decide it's done, you add the water on top in a joyful moment before showering them with buckets.   Maybe even have secret unlocks.  For example. If the player base decides a leader, they unlock Democracy. Ironically, it removes the one man one vote rule and their chosen leader alone gets to decide what the new tech is.
TRAITOR see what fame does u think u can get away
Yes Dessert
I liked desert
Jungle best
I hate ads >:(
Make a part 2
the jungle kills almost all of their people arctic general i didnt her no bell
I'm kinda surprised that squid_kid isnt king ngl
I was with jungle but sadly they all died
damn the poor guy was just worshipping Genshin but the zombie said no    also ahhh cant get enough of genshin soundtracks
MOREEEEEEEEE, THIS WAS SOOOO GOOD
how do u get in the events
The ad showcase was lit🔥
do more of these just subbed
Artic had the best village
this reminds me of the inca
It could have done a better job of simulating developing civilizations TBH.
Ize was def the worst part about this video
the fact that the thumbnail was straight up stolen by magicgum
The jungles King is a dictator technicaly
I want à sequel plz
ukraine be like as of the 27th of feb 2022
I wish jungle would have won. Desert got lucky that they were already low on people.
The jungle is turning into the 2020 American election
jungle lore is honestly more interesting than my whole life
Lol i remember when you made this channel, that wasnt even this long ago, How did you grow so fast lol? You will always be Speedsilver
I like how you used mario music 😂😂
The jungle kingdom would’ve been better off without that cocky leader and instead should’ve gone with the other guy
Another
against all odds lmao
R they playing this on pc or console
This was one of the most entertaining things I have ever watched; thanksss!
this video shows how good silver is. His 'stand' is so powerful that it killed that jungle player by picking them up and yeeting them   LOL
i love how he said best potato farmer and saw squid kid and said wait 2nd best potato farmer
Bruh Ize is like the most cringe person I have ever seen
I was so invested in Soup escaping and planning on winning it for Arctic then he TURNED AROUND AND HELPED THE JUNGLE KING WTF i wanted him to come back and win but he betrayed everything a died a traitor. tsk tsk.
Moral of the story, don't be a backstabbing prick
Nooooooooooooooonono
The artic kingdom.
It,s just like a movie I love it
I love good endings
I don’t know why when you were explaining this concept like it was ur own idea even though if anything your late to this trend
genshin impact music pog.
Jungle suckes ther king had 0 brain L
Jungle best
I was rooting for the arctic nation :(
I love the part where he just goes "the number 1 potato farmer, wait I said that wrong, the number 2 potato farmer."
I think the fact that there was an military push in the jungle empire made it so damn realistic. Great project
I liked jungle
Bro ize was a shitty leader
This was the best MinecrFt Civilization Video I have ever seen I liked the Animations
My fav was desert
so its an isekai got it
isn't that private fearless?
your wired
I was rooting for Artic but tbh I would've been happy as long as jungle didn't win 😅 I so wanna play next time like omg
I WAS VOTING FOR THE ARTIC OR THE DESERT
I was here from 3k. Good job Silver
😂😂 when he called squid the second best potato Farmer Lessgo
This just might be the best Minecraft video I have ever seen
Genshin impact isn’t that good it’s very boring but people have different and peculiar taste I must say
It’s disappointing how the jungle lost
Jungle could have win if the "clown 🤡" did not try to join desert
Jungle should have won
Really rooted for jungle
tbh the jungel village was the worst
I love it
Thank you for the code
Beautiful there always that one guy who thinks taking everything bye force is easier... love history
Hey i have an idea. Why not make 100 players play RL craft... That would be fun
I like genshin impact
I played genshin impact
6:03 this guy is chilling at the ground lol
Gold tools are trash
Do more content like this bro it's so fun to watch
Man i just hate the arcric/desert kingdom
I like Jungle the most no!!!!
I liked arctic the most
Please make a series like this but add dream teachno and all smp members that will blast in the internet
Jungle
This was actually good story wise as well..... I might even write a novel inspired by this whole video lmao
Awww, I hoped for arctic to actually win :(
Poor starkiller he was just tryna be friendly
에휴...
On a real, Ize made almost every part of the video involving him very unenjoyable to watch. Imagine being surprised that people on a, what's the term... oh yeah, ACTUAL Survival server have more interest than just grinding out mining for diamonds & PvP. I'm pretty sure his actions were responsible for about 70-80% of all player deaths on the server, & all of them were very easily avoidable. I'm >99% certain that if I ended up in the Jungle faction with him after he strong-armed & whined his way into leadership, I would have stolen a bunch of their resources, & defected to a neighboring faction,  maybe even take several players with me.
isn't this basically just magicgum's video reposted
the jungle nation wasnt healed after killing alot of artic players but they where to hungry if they waited for a bit they would be strong enough
suup whas the strongest in my opinion
artic
Your voice sounds weird.
The jungle team could do the same thing sparta did, have 2 kings. 1 for leadership and 1 for comabt.
I love this video
desert won because of silver's statues
I liked artic the most tbh. The jungle was disorganized, and I dislike their king. I don't have anything against desert though, they're cool. It's just, artic had a skate rink and a Christmas tree, how is anyone supposed to compete with that?
I like how in the background genshin impact songs were playing
I've been on your channel since 360,000 sub
Snow City = Chill, Spiritually and Pacifist Dessert City = Organized, engineering of Architectural for their agriculture and Neutral Jungle City = Distrust, Chaos and Hostile  Wonderful Lore for this civilizations and seeing how everyone is different one to another.
Every time i look at this thumbnail i read race war....
I loved this video keep up the good work
I watched this video for the third time now
Gosh, i hate that Jugle king
Genshin TRASHpact : A retard only game
my summary of the villages  Spoilers btw        Winter village : friendship   Jungle village : military coup   Desert village : NECROMANCY
The jungle players who turned the Among Us character statue into a dead one are gold
F**king RAIDEN SHOHUN NOW HAS MECH ARMS!!!
How your amazing I wish I could be invited to the next one
❄️ forever
Man, I fucking hated the jungle leader (Ize) Like I frickin hopped he would lose.
I wish there would be actual servers that do this concept lol it seems way too fun
I need a sequel to this pls pls pls
I like  how he review a desert player to be a overpowered “zombie”
I loved the jungle kingdom but after star died everything was ruined and I changed to desert
Jungle king shouldn't have assassinated star. His lust for power sealed his fate.
e
Jungle team
Well, silver kinda fucked jungle bois in this one, dessert squad had no idea the artic was gettin invaded, pluss they gained 5 new members
The fact that He secretly played the Genshin Impact Theme song is just making me go crazy on how much effort He put on this vid!!
Claim your before march ticket! Awesome video!!!
I beg of you please do more vids like this this was so good
im like legitamately mad at you for ruining the ice age
the jungle leader is pretty corrupted and very straight forward no prep time invade artic i mean the start is kinda good if the artic is undergeared i guess   "i hate my leader hes so cocky and annoying"
Pls again
Silver do u have 10
I love when the zombie attacked the jungle king, I got goosebump
I can hear you voice everyday
I first liked the jungle because I thought star killer is going to be the king but after ize became the king I just changed my mind and go for the desert
very good
Jungle civilization is brave but too greedy and not so teamwork Desert is very kind and carefull about their choise do Ice Is a civilization who loyal will revenge jungle civilization that kill their king  In my best civilization is jungle but ya its true before get king we must shared anything what we see so it will increase all trust in that guy who shared this info to other
Can i join you on bedrock or only java can play?
My man hasnt uploaded skyblock in over a year ;(
i didnt expect that holy hell
Can you pleas make more videos like this pleaaaas! Thank you, i realy liked your video
Man the jungle king guy was so friggin arrogant and cocky.
i hate everyone who killed arctic
His voice is goofy asf
U can also upload genshin videos that would be great
The jungle was too power hungry and resulted in a lost
2:20 man he's not joining your next event
Nooooooo jungle 😭😭😭😭😭
You should do more of these videos
🤩 I'm interested more of these kind of vids
Man this is really good you should do another
JUNGLE ALL THE WAY
What is Infernally doing there lmao
i don’t even play minecraft but this is really cool
This is epic!! make more of these videos, please
Lmfao Ize is the type of guy that makes minecraft unfun, i rlly enjoyed this video but his stupidity but the stupidity of his followers ruined part of it for me
Do it modded but its hard
jungle feels like the yeagerist
Jungle was nuts for content loved the king, great for content
2nd best potato farmer in minecraft. I almost choked 🤣🤣. Poor squid kid didn't stand a chance.
Thanks For Your Hardwork
I want to see this again please
My favourite was the jungle nation. LET THERE BE CARNAGE!!!
This was amazing I'm sure everyone would dig a sequel
Arctic was my clear favorite. I would totally vibe with them. What a great show!!!
I know no one cares but Ize was so annoying
I liked Jungle best because they attacked the other Civilizations just camped
Star killer? Hmm grew up with you Isaac lmao much love bro
Jungle king is bad guy
9:06 OH GOD ITS AN ARMY OF GENSHIN IMPACT PLAYERS IVAC THE WOMEN
I miss uhc, but this was amazing
second best potato farmer
That jungle guy was a terrible leader, the star dude was way better, honestly if they just waited they could’ve won just like the desert army did
i like the jungle but its a nice video
jungle do blitzkrieg
The fact is the other player joined are faked
32:14 rip starkiller
is anyone going to talk about the Genshin BGM he used during the main video XD
Jungle was peaceful then became the big bad because of that one guy
Pls do part 2
Desert cheated jungle won😡😡
whats this mod?
Bro that Jungle bias was so strong. Pls be more balanced
When he says 7 elements.. Me:*laughs in not dendro*
Jungle civilizacion was the worst great they lost
I Got Jumpscared When The Genshin Theme Song Start
2:51 touch grass before you get fat
‪Yo btw Christ loves u fr he died for all of our sins and took in the punishment we all deserved for our sin! 2 Cor 5:21  “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”‬
This was SUPER entertaining. I'd love to see more civilization videos.
Abstrekt zombie represents the peace loving souls lost to the jungle’s madness
I would have disliked, logged out and created another account to dislike again, if the jungle team had won.  They were by far least organized, least respectful, least human of all the teams.  And the decent people on the team were bullied and betrayed--awful moral.  Grats to the desert team.
Rip arctic  i was rooting for you guys
Rip. Squidkid Former best potato farmer
Desert is the best desert is the best
Bro said “uh no”
Meanwhile desert is just sitting around
15:08 the zombie came in as an anti cringe officer
I was thinking it’d so cool to have like the 3 kings have a meeting in a spot where the kingdoms connect but they aren’t allowed to fight each other,   only having a meeting about what’s happening in their territories and what they might do for their territories thats better just a little extra drama 😈  basically you can do anything but kill each other in that area
Squid kid has the most energy, I loved the part where he told u u were sick XD would love to see him again in Ur futrture vide
what software do u use to edit?
I didn’t expect I’m a squid kid to be in this he was part of the great potato war
I was rooting for jungle until they had the election…
Artic  Dessert Jungle
Cheers to the guy who brought the zombified member of their team in their base for 30 minutes of boating it  Edit; To think that I get 5K likes after a month lmao
Jungle kingdom was dope
I wish that star killer survived And became the king
Rigged
Rigged
Rigged
jungle  : Drama Artic    : Big sus Desert : Zombieman
arctic shoulve won
Please do more of these. I have seen nothing like it and think it’s absolutely amazing
Very nice vid, love these civilization simulation videos. Also loved how Ize did nothing but shit talk star killer but he was the one who led his nation to ruin, hard karma right there.
i never thought that i‘ll get 60 primos here
Jungle gang
Ayo why my man sound like Scoby Doo trying to sound serious 💀💀💀
I wanted jungle to won
What if you make world peace with the other team then it’s 50 and 2 Kings IF they make peace after the town elected kings for both civilization then it will be 2 kings they will be overpowered
The jungle king is literally putin in Russia lmao
9:08 🤣🤣🤣
I like how he put a technoblade skyblock reference in there with the giant potato competition
The first jungle king is actually a exact replica of Was Putin is doing to his people and Ukrainian
Nice Bro
I like desert beacuse they kind and Strong And teaming and Super Good at building
Jungle king is actually so annoying.
that man who spent half the game bringing back his friend as a zombie was amazing because of the ultimate twist that the zombie helped its team and killed multiple enemy players including the final king
I was cheering for desert
Really went above and beyond with this video. Well done!
The fact that u stole another youtubers for his  thumbnail is just woooo
Ngl my #1 region was the alpine kingdom but then after they lost players, desert won my liking the jungle was never the kingdom for me, this was incredibly fun to watch 😊
I hate the leader of jungle civilization
Jungle is goverment like, Arctic has lot of kindness, Desert seems like they are religious
Me loved the jungle civilization was the best
lets go suep in a vid with 5m views
is the server crossover?
Jesus Ize’s was just the worst
Will there be a civilization 2 i wanna be in it
W zombie
I WAS ROOTING FOR JUNGLE TOO!
BRUH THIS IS LITERALLY AVATAR
jungle best
Dude im so glad that jungle "king" die what a jerk lol
Why is this so heated in the jungle 😭😭
Yes
The desert was very strategic and recourseful
The desert was definitely my favourite. They were just so happy and only started to kill people when they were being attacked.
I liked artic
I liked the artic spirit
We need more of this kind of video
This was fun to watch, if you ever consider making a sequel, I suggest you include 1 more nation , making the player count for each region 25
Was definitely rooting for the dessert nation
Disgusting king mf
I can’t get twitter do you put the application on discord too
We need more
The snow village was wholesome

I sustained jungle
star killer would have won
Not gonna lie King Ize of the Jungle was a tyrant tbh, used fear and his power to rule over.
Ize May have been kind of a jerk but he was totally correct in all the decisions he made.
Jungle kingdom king was goated and i liked desert king. still i didn’t like desert or artic
can other people join
bullying squid kid
When he uploads my day gets better
I thought that the arctic was good and the secondd one is dessert cuz the jungles people wanted to kill
the jungle king is stupid to make war :/
Why is nobody talking about how similar this is to MagicGum’s version…
Thw jungle king is the worst king
The jungl king was brave enough and if he hadnt dropped his netherite sword he could have won and if backstabbing didnt take place in jungle kingdom jungle was gonna win for sure  dessert just got lucky
Arctic or jungle
Bro the zombie faught for his natiom
While Ize's personality is a bit toxic, I do commend the bold actions.
sad how the Jungle nation could of won if Ize wasnt killed
This is cool
If Starkiller had been king jungle would have won.
Omg they got a genshin impact sponsor and used genshin's music shortly later lmao. Also I'll take those 60 freemogems.
Star killer > flop ize
man just predicted it
Best part was when eyes died 😈
Honestly bro that jungle king was SUPER OBNOXIOUS cocky and a fucking dick I’m glad he lost I hope he never shows himself in another video again
Jungle, Idk i was just rootin fro em
DO MORE PLS
yknow they couldve reverse his point by telling ize that hed just have to give up his armor for the elected king.
So glad the jungle king died
"bro do you know how to combo" Haha that cracked my up real bad xd
6:46 Spanish people when they saw the natives in mesoamerica.
I have had 2 of my friends tell me that I sound like Ize and now that I've listened to him I think I do ;-;
Ize is a coward and worst leader and the guy he got to kill off Starkiller top coward.
nice video :)
Jungle was the best bcs ize is irish
Woah jungle village that wasn't in minecraft they just build it
God that guy with the first enchantment table seems unbearable
King ice sounds like jacksepticeye
This reminds me of my class back in 2021 we would learn this kinda stuff and it was not fun.
That jungle king was a tyrant, I'm glad he lost. (The first one, not the guy who was last left standing)
Arctic was my favourite, hands down. 🤩
I was really rooting for the winter civilization,btw what happened to them afterwards?
You shouldn't have taken a sponsor to a video which's idea and even thumbnail was directly taken from someone else (MagicGum)
https://youtu.be/2VYDRROrFqY
Just leave the server like exit the world and don't go on it during the blood moon
35:07 hell yeah payback
I loveee the spirit of the arctic players. They were like holy saints. Too bad being invaded and vikings
This was cool lol
Jungle was best
i dont like the jungle because of the jungle king
14:51 AMONG US
Hey silver I really hope you see this but for another civilization video you could do the end the nether and the over world and if so please invite me to play I would love being the end like the end players could teleport and the nether had infinite fire resistance and the over world well you come up with that so I hope you like this idea and I think it would be really good content hope you liked it bye silver i love you content btw😄😶
Bro I was cheering for the jungle team until they started disagreeing and going against one and other and then I started to cheer for the desert because of their leadership and all their cool ideas. Great video and the zombie dude mad respect for him and the guy who brought him back to the civilization overall great video.
my love is with the jungle
"there is going to be a blood moon that increases mob spawns" damn and here we thought terraria was the knock off
Ize was annoying as hell bruh, he's the one who kept shouting over people
Voice
in the town building I would of went desert then ice finally jungle
This is an exact copy of ish
Desert Kingdom because there Warriors were powerful enough to defeat all kingdoms
keep making these videos!!!
We want another :D
Man I was hoping for the frost kingdom to win
Jungle should have won and would have fun if there wasnt as much conflict on chosing who should be the king, being a strong and forceful leader is needed in a war situation but i feel like after taking out the arctic they should have made sure atleast almost most of the jungle population should have diamond armour and diamond swords and also make sure everyone had enchanted their stuff, people in iron were clearly at a huge disadvantage and got targeted.
The Jungle kingdom had everything to win: a strong leader, good gear, high team morale and most importantly a strong desire to achieve victory. However, they let that desire and power get into their heads because of a series of events and coincidences.  Let's start with their begining: They spawned with an area with abundant early-game resources like food and wood, and didn't have much trouble going trough the famine event, so they developed very quickly at the start and got ahead of the others.  Now to their first "leader" Starkiller: He was a key piece in unifying that whole region to make the most of their resources and to get them to do teamwork. You can think of him as a "parent" that was looking out for their child and doing the best for them.  Their second leader and first king Ize: He was a man with the true desire to win that game and went out of his way to make sure that would happen. He knew a friendly leader like Starkiller would make the cut, so he went against him. Now, that wasn't easy to do because of Star's popularity and how the people viewed him as wholesome, which is a very strong weapon to get people to agree with you. So, Ize's only option was to take the kingdom by force and forbidding other members of talking about Star, and that was made possible by the strong gear and allies he had.  The artic invasion: It started out roughly with people dying at the start and loyalty to Ize low, as some people viewed him as evil and a dictator. Although I still think the invasion was in no way off timing, since had he waited any longer, the Starkiller followers would have thrown him out of his position or at least caused unnecessary deaths. Ize managed to convince all of them (and it's important to note that he convinced *all* of them, because, had some not followed, trust would never be built in those that stayed behind, not to mention the invasion would probably never have succeeded that way) and then led them to what was (luckily) the all-time-high of the entire jungle civilization with the defeat of the artic people.  The downfall of the jungle civ: It started out with the king's rushed decision to invade the desert area. There were some reasons i believe caused this choice: The high team morale and newly-found trust in the king that would probably quicly fade and not have the same great effects in battle had they waited for longer. The new equipment and weapons they got from the raid since with their weaker army they still managed to beat a civilozation. The uncertainty of the next world event that could cause severe damage to their already low population. And lastly the idea that Ize and his people were the strongest and had already won the game, due to their previous big success. The reasons that led them to fail, however, are the following: The unorganized inventory of their available weapons and resources, the lack of a concrete plan of attack and strategy, the little knowledge available on the desert civ, the incomplete decimation of the artic people which allowed some of the defeated but still alive to join the desert civilization and the exceding trust and fear of warning their king, who could kill anyone that defied him.  Therefore, the jungle'uns were the most propense to win due to their strong headstart and passionate leader, however it took one rushed decision due to several reasons to make them fall. Thank you for coming to my TED-talk. (Also, I don't think i need to mention that this is merely my subjective appreciation of the events that happened in the video, and are in no way 100% guaranteed to be correct, comment down your own thoughts!)
Genshin impact = fatherless behavior
WAIT ARE THEY FANS!?!
The squid kid joke lol
The desert kingdom is very toxic for killing him with their stupid dead teammate is that even fair?
The jungle king was being anoying. Then he had my respect by helping his nation, the i lost all of that respect when he told that guy to take his armor of and then betraied him.
I would love to play with you but I dontt have twitter
yes we all love technoblode
i wouldve been routing for the jungle if the other guy had won the election. but he didnt so i was on arctics side
Jungle leader ize is literally imperial japan in a nutshell
The artic is a VIBE
part 2 pls
How can you be so dumb to disobey your king...
Glad dessert won, hated jungle's king
thats when you know your a smack talker when you are getting chased by a literal zombie for how annoying you are.
I like how he used Liyue battle theme song, it goes hard (Inazuma's Duel in the Mist battle theme song too)
Someone needs to animate this.
This was great hope you make another one of these
I enjoyed this video until the Genshin Impact Sponser came. I’m starting to think my favorite youtuber is becoming a discord moderator
Desert is my favorite
I liked the Artic man because the amongus one was the best part
ize reminded me of an dsmp character... but idk which
Thumbnail : *philippino flag upside down*
do more of these kingdom stuff, its awesome
The beat farmer is technoblade
Wich  mods You used
Silver: the best potato farmer, wait I said that wrong. The SECOND best potato farmer
MORE OF THESE PLEASE
Jungle is the best cuz all mighty monke
2:23
Jungle was so so GOOD
I love this so much the Jungle kingdom reminds me so much of the story of Macbeth where his malice and betrayal in the name of ambition destroyed the land from within. Rest in peace Starkiller 🙏
This was my favorite vid you ever made! And that’s saying something
You've really outdone yourself Silver!
i like how im a squid kid is placing potatoes, he still can't accept he lost to technoblade
What seed is this?
I still remember when you had 100k subs with beating the game challenges
Just my opinion but arctic deserved 1st  Mainly cause they didn't fight each other at the start Had a whole religious and meeting thing going on And unlike the other 2 they were a very teamwork based group   Heck they even had tons of places to relax and stuff Even it's people were getting along so good they worked more with less effort than the others (That's my opinion for the chest thing :D)
This video was great. The whole timeline had me all over the place, wondering who would do what, and I would love to see another one of these videos.
The dwarven fortress entrence kinda look the the hypixel sky block gold mine-
Jungle best
GO GENSHIN IMPACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
SEQUEL SEQUEL
I love your ur vids keep it up 😽😽😽😽
No the cowwww
I liked arctic most. They were so happy and joyful.
I would watch 1 million version’s of this and love it every time please make more of these
Maybe next you could do an expiriment with players in a "modern" civilization during an apocolypse
100% should make another one! That looks like so much fun to be part of.
Jungle
What is the mod called to be able to pick warrior farmer and miner
22:11 "HE JUST HAS A ACCENT" I CANT-
Desert: an average countey Arctic: a chill team Jungle: one man dictatorship
23:17 so are we jus supposed to ignore the panda doing a barrel roll in the back ground🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The jungle army is a perfect representation of a dictatorship   Loved it
Genshin impact more like shit infact
Should’ve added the tough as nails mod so that people have to adapt to their chosen land.
This didn't age well...
I would be a farmer. And i would know how to make many... Diffrent... Farms...
Jungle was my favorite
this is amazing bro !
Nooooooooooooooo jungle didn't win
Dude all the desert kingdom did was stay in their town and farm resources while ize actually grew some balls and attacked, and then the Arctic pussied out and joined the desert, and then got killed again, and then the desert just picked off the survivors. Jungle should’ve won, respect to ize
i love how heroic jungle kindom is with their leader
Pls make more
NOOO GENSHIN IMAPCT
genshin soundtracks omg
why did he do squid kid like that ik tecnoblade is the best but still
I kinda liked jungle civilization ngl
damn bro you didnt need to disrespect quid kid like that lmao
You released this at the perfect time
Squidkid
I wish the jungle kingdom came back to life and finish of the desert kingdom
Jungle was my favorite they were smart and worked hard
Plz 2nd part
I was rooting for the Jungle, they did surprisingly well at the end, 16v25 and they were able to drop half of Desert's force without losing a single person.
Copy🐈
I’ve checked out other 100 players after your video and tbh, I like yours so much better. Maybe because of how you organized it and like watched the players and commentated on what was happening. Other ones just start of and wam, chapter 1 beginning. Yours have stages too but its easier to keep track of.
If u do a pt 2 can u add more regions like forest, mountains or swamp
the jungle. i liked most
Ize stratergies werent the problem. It was the way he went about it. Wanting to invade and surprise attack was smart. But he should have worked with starkiller as the people loved him, and he should have listened to the people more in what they thought. He had a low population and people turning on him because he is a BAD leader. But a good fighter. He should have been perhaps made star the "prime minister" with him as king. So he could get the buffs, plan the attack. With stars dealing with the diplomatic side of things. Would have been the best way to unite the jungle civilisation and i think they could have won. Starkiller is way more charaismatic, ize comes across as demanding and arrogant.
Some bad timing
Thank you so much for making this video! I really enjoyed it. 😀
thanks for the time stamp for the ad
Minecraft: The Tyranny of King Ize
Starkiller was much more of a leader. Way more leadership just because I've had more gear doesn't mean that Starkiller doesn't have any leadership experience
I really dislike the jungle king. He gives shit orders and blames everyone for his own mistakes. He doesnt listen and isnt helpful to his civilization and does nothing to raise morale. Star whould be a batter leader.
i like dessert
i wanted jungle to win :(
was rooting 4 desert and arctic cuz honestly jungles king was just cruel man
I love this video. I like political games and stuff like that, but seeing it with real players is very nice.
Even from the grave he saved his team
THE KING IS BACK!
bruh this is just a cheap copy of magicgum's videos
Desert but my friend artic
Lol that 1 full diamond guy was a clown
I got so happy when the Jungle king died he is so annoying.
The Arctic Kingdom were the smartest while the Desert Kingdom had the most land and Jungle Kingdom had the most people; I like the Arctic Kingdom the most.
Y u do that to squidkid
Desert kingdom was my favourite as it reminded me of the necrons from 40K
I miss Hypixel skyblock!
I like the Jungle kingdom most
This video was a amazing idea I wish I. Was in it
The among us statue was a choice made purposefully
YOOOO SQUID KID
acc was really fucking cool. this felt like a movie
Sorry to break it to you but I'm pretty sure that you stole this thumbnail
Can you do more of these
Wow these guys are real troopers  Definitely getting significant vibes from this too
That zombie got his revenge 🔥🔥
R.I.P for the guy at 5:00, you could see he tried separating the creeper from his teammates with this body
Please make more Civilization Videos! 🔥🔥
Loved it :))
could there be a download for the map pleeeeaasa
Is  fun how the most arrogant player got elected as king on jungle teamit's literraly like real life but in my opinion snow and desert were the most fun to watch jungle was pure chaos which the king shouting at everyone which dint followed him like a dictator  was soo fun watching him dying lmao
27:20 LOL ITS KERNOS
2:22 he got violated here
Wow Soup is a monster
wow this videos thumbnail aged like milk
It's funny how they don't even fight back against the Jungles. They all get killed while running away
The arctic were getting along so well and having fun, I wish they won.
At first 40m was boring to watch........but then here i am ,watched without passing the video
Please more from this. That is a greate Idear
That jungle dude who became king is so god damn annoying
Love the video but please try to make you're voice sound less... annoying?
Dam the genshin music in the background
LETS GO GENSHIN IMPACT best game ever
SEQUEL
Star deserved SO much better.
I was going for the desert
Stupid abstrekt zombie jungle should have won
Even after death, he helped his army
New Video:  Minecraft Civilization Part 2: Plains, Taiga, and Savanah biomes

The leader of the Jungle Kingdom his ass
This video was amazing just keep making those videos

Why I hate ice so much
Starkiller wouldn't have done this 🤓
My favourite Civilization was the arctic
0:29 hmm mincraft dungeoins chest
Ngl, Ize made me hate the Jungle Civ. Arctic Kingdom will never be forgotten.
i like how u used genshin miusic motive in this movie
Part 2
#screwjungleloveartic
Jungle had karma catch up to them
i was playing genshin impact while u said abaut sponsor xDD
Did anyone notice TimeDeo 0:09
👏🏼 👏🏼👏🏼
I was routing for jungle kingdom. But desert won well done.
fun to watch, but the jungle kingdom got on my nerves. just because someone else is inspiring means you’re going to murder them? Or because someone likes the other, more understanding leader, you’re going to kill them? the jungle leader got on my nerves. what a b*tch.
Xiao is my sister favorite skin a the girl that has the ghost that a other one but that’s her most favorite!
Yeeees!!!!!! My favorite was Desert all the time and I'm hapoy that they win
My sister plays that all the time
The desert kingdom
Personally Star should have been King
the jungle team was on track to win and had a great leader, i was 100% rooting for them until they got overtaken by a tyrannical ruler who had no idea what he was doing. honestly the jungle team deserved to lose for letting that guy take over, he clearly had no idea what he was doing and if anybody even mentioned it he would immediately threaten to kill them, not the smartest thing to do for sure
Who finds it that the jungle group hot robbed the hole it
32:40 norespect
We definitely need this to become a trend YouTube would be so entertaining imagine all your favorite YouTubers playing this !!!
I was really pulling for anyone, but the jungle kingdom honestly, because their leader was so intolerable to watch and listen to.   Jungle would've been better of with starkiller for sure.
Bro ... Why ?
“I’m gonna elect myself king, sound good?”
i loved this so much
I loved the Genshin music in the background of the clips, it really fir the video!
I literally just played earthbound today and I’m hearing the music now
Artic
This is more entertaining than most movies I saw
Pls do another one
Dessert zombie MVP no contest bro
juggle team have communist
Star king and quid kid r my favs
I would love to participate on somehting like this, looks amazing r
That mario music threw me wayyy back
This is probably the wors minecraft civ video
Nice try buddy. You seriously stole MagicGum’s thumbnail and freaking idea!
Ayo where's the kingdom of science
I was here since you had your first video and 26k subs good 👍 work
this must have been insane bravo
Holy shit this community of nerds was omega cringe
We want more of these videos
The jungle nations were foolish to choose Ise as king. He has already proven to be extremely selfish at the start when he hid the diamonds and enchants, not thing about the big picture
2:21 ah yes a reference to the great potato war of 2020
imagine copiying someone elses content LMAO. couldnt be me
i think the jungle civilization shoud of won
Jungle should’ve won
i HATE those desert dumbys
My favourite is the desert because the jungle King is sooo annoying.
I need more videos like this
As he said that red moon will apear there would be infinite tsukyomi 😂😂
Bro this video is the most interesting video soo much interesting i watched the whole 40 mins without skipping even the sponser part
I am happy to see tha the jungle kingdoom lost, I don't know why but i didn't like theire leader.
Add a industrial mod
For me, was with the sand clan because the desert is very advantageous because of pit fall traps, they didn't use it but GG for them for the win
9:04 what has humanity come to.
Artic had the best looking village, should’ve been 2nd at least
The Genshin impact ost fits perfectly....
Some great content man always love seeing videos like this
booooo desrt stinks!
What if... Hear me out.. what if a certain *pig were to participate in this event?
2:55 and thats where i leave
ngl i hat desert
Yo 21:21 My boy IAmSquidKid is here!!!!
"Remember, if all players know that theres a forced war after a while, they are not civilizations, they are military bases."
Sequel  (New role idea? Mobtamers)
Tbh, I would've like to live in the Arctic kingdom, don't care if they're ranked the lowest or they died, they handled the election properly, at least to me, and they are chill, they just panicked and the leader was also I trouble to group up the members of the kingdom.  The jungles are aggressive, their king is a war monger, the dessert is my second choice of the kingdom I'd join because they are also civil and is peaceful
9:00 the few seconds that revealed fatherless children
This Was Epic ! I was kinda sure that jungle would have won even though they were my least favourite civilization ( I don't hate them they are good but not as good as the other civilizations to me ) because of ize at the start then he seemed good. My favourite was Arctic but I was sure they will not win since,they weren't that much serious but they actually came close and outlasted jungle . Almost kinda like a movie the tyrant loses at the end. And poetically,arctic's general got the kill on him which was completely  deserved as he literally massacred them. Soup might have had a chance If he told the desert people that was his plan even theiugh they were gonna betray him and get the crown  of ize but ,it was good I liked desert and lot too . THIS VIDEO WAS AMAZIN !
I FCKGIN AHETATEA DESERQT I WILL NEVER UBILD A HOUSE IN DESERT ANYMORE BC I WANTED JUNGLE TO WIN IF JUNGLE WOULD WIN THEN I WOULD S TILL BUILD A HOUSE IN DESERT BUT IM NOT ANYMORE IMMA DESTROYE THE HOUSE IN DESER THAT I MADE IT IS TRASH BC DESERT WON AND I WANTED JUNGLE TO WIN UGH
Can this be like a series or something?
You should do 4 civilian next time , with a 5th one that know knows about untill the end
Make this content again pls but 300 player
the jungle king has been so toxic ass like i wonder what he is in real life lol probably worse im not suprised if he even killed his family lol
Dessert group are 100% teamwork
Another Minecraft civilisation but with the tekkit mod and Archimedes mod. Goal is to set up a permanent base on the moon.
32:00  "No teammeats are gone"  (when there is 36 of them)
I liked artic                F
Is that a TECHNO REFERENCE!!! 🐷👑
I'm glad that the team I was rooting for finally won in one of these experiments T-T
Artic king just won cus he has a deep voice
LOL no segs xD no baby hahahah
No🥺
ANARCHY
Please have a sequel!
Mooooooore
Genshin osts suited some situation pretty well
The jungle King gave me headache. Never seen a less likeable person.
Wondering how genshin is sponsor lol
Even though jungle started killing ice seign the survior started to rob the desert and even at the end was helping jungle I say 1 desert was nice 2 jungle just playing how they want to 3 worst should be teaming up but become the worst and rob anyone which are not on there sode
Poor second best potato farmer
Can you only mace ONE Hypixel Skyblock Video again pls.
I guess I can't join since I got PS4
30:45 LMAOOO
tell me why i cringed at the part where he said " everyone jump if you like genshin impact" and when everyone jump i died of cringe. Also why the fuck would you sponsor genshin. Never expected this. Thought you were better than this Silv.
Lmao I was playing Genshin amd watching this video haha
Legend has it squid kid is still farming till this day
Jungle - Best  Arctic - 2nd Best Desert - You suck you campers all you did was sit in your base! 3rd Place
I like snow and desert then jungle attack snow so I don't like them snow betrayed desert so I like desert
i liked the artic civillication
I'm all in for that Abstrekt zombie.
i love this. This is a masterpiece. The way the jungle king was confused when a desert member was a zombie and was attacking him was the best, its like a movie scene when a friend come back to life to avenge his nation.
How does the zombie warrior thing work? why it doesnt attack them?
Bru jungle leader was annoying af
More
I feel like hypixel could make this into a gamemode
can i join this server pls
Intro music: C418 DOOR
This is so better than the other civilization videos not like others this has events like loot stuffs and so on while others just like normal Minecraft also i hope you make another but with 5 nations Mountain,jungle,artic,desert,ocean
I liked the Jungle people because how power full there leader was
The jungle was the dominant force and had a good winning attitude but they were out numbered
When the whole dream smp was on this video and on jungle team and wins I would be there to I will be on jungle
i liked the jungle but when that guy became king they became rude
You need to have more videos like this.
The jungle kingdom are heartless
11:52 big IQ moment 😂
I was hoping frost civilisation would win…
Bruh you copied magicgums thumbnail.
35:44 this part had me dying hahahahahahha
Nice stolen thumbnail
nooo that one jungle dude he was rlly trying to join but damn to bad he died
I hate the jungle king “eyes” because of his annoying ass personality and how he made it not even fun for anyone on his team.he really pisses me off
People like the jungle "king" are called "Hitl*r"
this was amazing pls do mote
Please credit origins for the classes.
Find the same type players of this game, putting few crazy monkey in a team to kill everything isnt fun to watch
Can you make part 2?
That ize guy just makes my blood boil
Holy shit these people are cringe  arguing on minecraft leadership and saying "do you know how to combo" get a life 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
4:59 He should go down in history… best Minecraft sacrifice ever
not gonna lie i was kinda hoping jungle would lose
Imagine u were there and go mine in a cave and when u have full diamond armor and echant and go now straight to the nether
Dis is epic
I have never played Minecraft in my life (well that's a lie... I have), but I've never got very much interested into Minecraft in my life, I have like less than 10 hours of total time I've spent in it, but this video attracted me because of The Civilization aspect and I like Civilization simulation especially when there's multiple real players not NPCs amd I thoroughly enjoyed this video. For the first time I've sat through a whole 40 min Minecraft video and this was very well created. I want to see more of this, and more larger!
I NEED TO SEE MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS
thx for the Freemogems
ABSTREK YEEEAHHHHHH
this aged well
im kind of disappointed arctic lost they were my favorite :(
I like to think that the Zombie helped them as a thanks for giving him a new home :)
I love how silver just put the genshin impact battle music lmao
What is an amazing video
I Need more of this
he even put genshin music in background ;)
9:07 I bet they all are fatherless
Oh S###
DESSERT KINGDOM BABYYYYY
This is best Civilization minecraft video i have ever seen mate
damn this could be a really good movie tho. jungle civil as the antagonist and arctic as the main char
Congratulations because of this very video You made me your new subscriber RIP STARKILLER
New subscriber!

This was cool and all but Ize took the game way too serious
gayshit impact ad ruined the video :sob:

The desert king is the saying "A wise king never seeks out war. But he must always be ready for it." Personified
This guy's voice sounds like i just called customer server
Genshin is shit
Desert for the win
ok
This feels like Naruto story🙂
Who ever was the king for jungle is a prick
I wanted the desert kingdom to win and I was NOT disappointed
I wanted the desert kingdom to win and I was NOT disappointed
I was so rooting for the jungle, but then the betrayal happened and J wanted someone to take the tyrant down.  What a movie lmao
Jungle King was a tyrant he should've been impeached.
35:52 gOsH
Artic was the best
Ok
Stole a thumbnail on one of trixyblox's videos 40:27
Rip 🪦 starkiller
=( starkiller F
No cause I do this in my single player world 😀
please make another one
YESS! LETS GO !!!  DESSERT WAS THE GOAT ALL ALONG!!!
I LOVE JUNGLE
Jungle was kinda dumb for attacking first because then Desert would just kill off the remaining people of the fight…
no offense but out of the 3 of them, the jungle civilization was easily the dumbest. #1: they didnt work together whatsoever from day 1 #2: they elected a bad king #3: they dont cooperate at all. if ANY civilization would win, id be the arctic one. but i havent watched the whole video yet
Nah I thought jungle will win
the jungle civilization are discord mods
SEQUEL PLS!!!
I like jungel
It’s funny how he’s using genshin impact music for back ground
i lagged when you said "funky business" so it sounded like "fucky business"
Omg I watched you when you were on 100 subs and now I come back a see 1.8 mil subs well done
Jungle wouldve won if ize stayed alive
Damn I was really rooting for the jungle kingdom
Please make more like this
My opinions on every region  Arctic: Although they don't have the best strength, their town has tbh the best design so far for me  Desert: They have the best resources and their counters to the Jungle attack. They are very organized in planning the next step for their victory  Jungle: Strength is their best things but the problem is how they organized the election and how it turned into a conflict. Their strategy is even risky and has no backup plan for their invasion.  Overall, all are good
It's like rise of kingdom
i like most jungle civilization
ZSPDKSC3V8V5
Wait I just saw painful
That king is kinda a a hole
i like arctic (bc i like winter)
Hated the jungle king, total bully.
I love how its so laggy in the server ;-;
My favorite was artic nation
I need more of this
Jungle could have a chance if it wasn’t ize
Desert civilization was just lame , Jungle was my favorite
9:05. Disgraceful.
I remember when you had 56k and it got better and better please do this again i beg of you
I hate the jungle leader he is mean
Love how the video uses the genshin's ost
Arctic
Yo bro my name is like that cuz you inspired me on Filming so i wanted to say thank you bro
WOOOOOOOOO HAPPY ENDING FOR THE DESERT CAVILIANS!
I hate the Second king from the Jungle
jungles should have never killed Star
Jungle had the best leader
this could be the best minecraft video i have ever watched
If I became last person on a team against 11 then I’d just ask for max gear max sword end crystals obsidian and enchanted gapples and just 11v1 it
R.i.P Star
Desert has the least tools but winned Because smarter not harder
ize kinda mean and a expert lieng
The jungle king is so dumbbbbb
PART 2 PART 2 PLEASE ❤️❤️❤️
JUNGLE KING BEEN BANISHED TO HELL  DESERT RULEZ
Omg I am really happy desert won
He took magicgums thumbnail and changed the soldiers armor color and he used the same npc and hunger event ideas from other people I used to like his content but this is sad and pathetic
never mess with abstrekt 😆
Please do more of this it was really fun to watch
Bruh I didn’t know genshin even needed to sponser, it’s such a good game with lore and a storyline. My fav chac is Thoma
I did like the juggle but wet i see the King im like nope wet i see the desert king im like he serms Nice and the king vote good so i might love the desert Clan
omg
If starkiller was alive jungle would have won
25:06  “Was caught off guard by a creeper” *dies to a phantom*
Ize is basically an ISIS recruiter and whoever thought he is a good leader to follow unironically is what's wrong with people.
jungle civilization is accurate , full of resources and the people are greedy.
I love watching big wars I liked the desert army
Definitely need more
I loved the ice one
Bruh someone needs to check if that one guy is mentally stable. And I know everyone knows who I’m talking about
The goosebumps I'm getting rn while watching one of my favourite games *and* hearing the Liyue Battle theme from Genshin is just- 💀💀💀💀
Where do I watch the others videos?
Me just realise that he used genshin music as the backsound
Thumbnail stolen from: magicgum
It is jungle
This was one of the most entertaining videos ever please make more!
I vote to jungle because they're good at civilization
Artic❤️❤️❤️
Although the jugle king was actually abit cocky, he was still so strong
I was rooting for desert but then I saw jungle got netherite i still did not change my mind bc desert ppl were cool
Lol
Lol they're funny
12:24 Why does he sound like the phone guy?
To be honest I didn't like the leader of the jungle Nation remember Star.
My favourite was jungle civilization
this is strangely entertaining
jungle
This vid was sooo good 😭🥰
i play genshin impact
2:14 nc diamonds
well this was fun video to watch during the day
These videos are epok
Rip starkillier
You should continue hypixel skyblock i loved it😭
Jungle leader was an asshole tbh
9:05
When the jungle went to the beach it became D-day in Minecraft
Omg yes Go genshin I love the jungle team
Plzz do another event like this with 200 players
this is cool
I love these types of videos
Bro i play Minecraft pe can i join events like this
Jungle, they can win if Ize's strength is kinda humbe than like full of betrayal
I like this video but ads every 3 minutes kinda ruined it
I like the most jungle sadly they lost
https://youtu.be/G16wuXPoZso
I liked Artic, too bad they died first
Am I the only one who heard Badboyhalo on jungle?
The ravager drops saddle so id say that's a good drop
this is actually cool
Jungle started a war, meanwhile desert wasn't harmed
Lags
that girl in 30:24 saying oh the lag when *she literally has 120 FPS*
Desret
Haven’t finished the video yet but hope the jungle king dies. Horrible leadership
Im proud man.. u grew so fast i was subbe since u were 10k subs u grew so fasttt
This seems like something my friend would enjoy taking part in, seeing as he's absurdly aggressive in Minecraft.
I loved how disgusting the jungle nation was
Screw.the jungles king
Apologize to the 3 people who died on arctic
Do more of this please I watch till the end and I like subscribe and put notifications please I like it
i like desert cuz they friendly and no to the jungle cuz they a little toxic
Jesus this is fire nation all over again...
Everyone jumped when he asked if they liked genshin impact because they knew if they didn't he would kick them 🤣🤣🤣
38:40 why he killed everybody you know he massacred them why are you betraying an hour away you could stop them and win what reason they have low population
jungle is best
the jungles were about to hit the Russians hard... but then it got cold. Stupid cold.
Yo soup is from a different channel
Literally silver is watching and said how did that guys died? Hmmm....... Dunno I think bug? Lol
I saw Nestorio
"And you guys killed none of them.... Gosh"
i love youre vids
Plz
I really liked the jungle one bc it's king was ize no I don't know ize but I liked him as king
Ize made me want to stop watching. Man, that dude was so God damn annoying. Loves the sound of his own voice and the smell of his own shit
At first, I thought IZE was just playing the villain, but the more he talked the more I realized he was right. I would have followed him into battle for sure.
such a good video pt. 2 plz
Please make another one of these
Oh hell no Genshit infact
Me when I saw the first part of the video: Idk who you are but you just got a new subscriber
Ize is a W Leader fr
i was rooting for the desert kingdom and THE DESERT KINGDOM WIN LET'S GOOOO DESERT
this used to exist on 4chan  4craft it was, every board would fight, except the map makers were biased and did things like give /mlp/ a mountain of diamond blocks. It isn't around anymore, but it sure was fun
what the mic pugin u use
secual
Ize was like the villain of this story i wanna see him back getting revenge or something
Can you imagine having 1.81 million subs and getting a hundred of them to make your content for you, for free?
24:34 look at chat. Scripted?
I wanted the jungle kingdom to win so bad
Man abstrekt really is a good teammate,nothing can stop him
Good job :)
I routed for the sand nation because it reminds me of shurima
The Jungle king was like "if star was elected you guys would stay and eat carrots " and look at him now he is dead. Also nice video 10 out of 10 I like it nice work
HAHA the way you called out squidkid for being second best XD
Damn why’d you do squid kid like that
9:02 bet you haven't showered in three weeks
More
The irony of the jungle king’s ambition and treachery hit its climax when his ego got in the way and forced his own soldiers to fight through hoards of mods and 2 assaults which left him alone and in the end he was chased by a literal reanimated husk (kinda symbolic for star killer and all the jungle people he lead to their deaths)
I wanted jungle to win
honestly, the jungle story is the most sad here. honestly Iez was a dictator I was happy to see fall. long live the desert and remember starkiller
after they won their first fight, the jungle kingdom should've slowed down and re-evaluated their position. If they had waited for just a bit the desert kingdom would've probably finished off the arctic for them. being too aggressive made them lose.
The jungle king was bad he only focused on winning and called people stupid for dying and killed someone just for wanting to be king L jungle king
That full diamond guy in the Jungle civilization sounds like PrivateFearless.
I wished Star killer would be the king because he would not make Enemies but what if then the Desert became power hungry… This would mean that they would get wiped out with the Armor advantage
I love that everyone in Artic is just hving a good time which I would do in Minecraft or Real Life
Tell me what mods u used
What about the winter didn't they team up
more entertaining than most other videos
This video was insane! I love the civilization stuff either in games or real life so doing this in Minecraft was so cool to see. Adding more biomes and different challenges can give crazy ideas to the people. Loved the video!
I was actually hoping for desert to win. Great video btw!
the Genshin music in the background
did the artic player die? CUZ I LOVED THEM!!
11:44 ukrain vs russia
Lmao the zombie
I hated the jungle king. He did good bit felt too cocky and ruthless
Earthbound theme lets gooooooooooooooooooo
another one?
This is cool
Jungle was pretty much the Sparta out of the three civilizations
can we get a 07 for starkiller
Make more Plz
Ize was so unbearable to listen to
And i hope the jungle kingdom lose
So cool
This was just epic, couldn't stop watching any second! Amazing video
lets just accept the fact that squid kid is in this video
GUYYS, WELCOmE tO RiSe oF kInGOMs!!!!! ChoosE yOur MinEcRaft ciVililizatIon!!!11!        Love your vids <3
Need another one asap
Can I please be in one I’ve always wanted to be in one
can you add me to your server
The argumen of the 2 crowns
i voted for artic
The ones that I was rooting for was Jungle but then after seeing their horrible operations with each other I moved on to Desert and Arctic I knew one of them had to win because both of them had good operating with each other and picked a good leader that had good plans and good traps the jungle could win the game but they picked a horrible leader and the leader from the jungle Kingdom thought he was more better than everyone else he was making dumb decisions like going into war when there was a blood moon that's just my opinion how the jungle Kingdom could have won
your video is copyright by a china person and said is his own one
*OMG NICE MINECRAFT ❤️💕*
holy crap i saw you at 20k subs playing uhc and now your at 1.8m CONGRATS MANN
Was I the only one who wanted the jungle to win??   I just want to know
if people like clownpierce had the warrior class, they would just be unbeatable
Robbymcfly shouldve been the leader their voice isnt annoying
I knew the desert would win 😹 they are a team, get a long and have decent recources.
I hate his voice
Im so glad jungle lost
I fell he got the type of players from destiny 2
RIP starkiller u are the true jungle king :(
14:50 AMONGUS
The zombie had me burst of laughter bro...
I was rooting for artic but changed after suep decided to betray desert lol
35:46 that reaction XD
Mario music is nostalgic
The jungle leader seemed so rude
The arctic kingdom was my favorite
Has to be jungle because of the one who was ganna be nominated
Desert
thought this was the video MagicGum made
the king of jungle was a terrible leader imo star would have been better
O
jungle was amaizing
All My Homies Hate Ize I’m So Glad He Lost I Think They Would Have Been Better Off With Star As Their Leader.
Face reveal at 2mil?
I loved the arctic because they made the most beautiful city. Also, if they were more serious about gear, I would probably think they could win.
Surprisingly, this is exactly how real life events takes place, each resembling a trait of a different form of power and human nature, the artic: passive with little strength but peaceful, the desert: a silent powerhouse with moderate power, and the jungle: a complete dictatorship with strong power.  Scary thing is the invasion of the jungle kingdom is what happens in real life as well, with a single leader taking power with strength and look to conquer other nations for more power, first ruling with only fear then uniting the people after a grand victory against another nation, but ultimately falling to a unified army with refugees from fallen nations. Love the video!
"Yo guys, Im gonna elect myself king!"  Clan- "Ugghhhhmmmmmmm, no!"
Artic nation is probably the most livelier than the other nation the desert nation is seemingly organised about their stuff meanwhile the jungle nation is just chaos by politics war and other stuff
Bruh he just copied https://youtu.be/1OPAH2txO0A this guys video idea but did it better lol and he copied his thumbnail idea too
Jungle king LLLL
Do more of this do a series
IN VOTING HOW WAS ARTIC LAST IT WAS FIRST IN MY EYES ;(
Great video! Do more of these videos please
Everyone gonna ignore the music selection it's a straight 1000000/10
Part 2 please with realms/dimensions??? New biomes?
I have 20k :V
Only 60?
40:6 lol
Desert
more
I want to watch more your video's are awesome!
"I put more dedication in this undead than school work" Relatable 😓
I love the way of the jungle civilization became a dictatorial civilization and the king was the real villian of this history ♥ is better than a movie
Bro I’ve never hated anyone more than ize
2:20 Why you gotta do that man dirty like that?
I wish i had a pc to play competitions like this :(
Star will always be a star in my eyes if he was the leader the jungle would have won but insted the “king” backstabbed everyone and lost
Jungle did well but was quickly overrun with greed that brought them to there downfall the two king crowns that jungle had should have formed a moshpit for the two kings on the out side as the members of the jungle nation does the damge the kings take the tanking roll and retreat into the rest of them when there low
1st of all: this was such good video. 2nd of all: this is better than america lore. 3rd of all : best plot
More civilisations!
Me want to be in sequel my user be TheChaker111
I always like and sub and you make new videos that I love there so cool
Your my favourite youtuber
Yo invite me next time bro :(
I liked the Artic one the most
this guy has the worlds first valk and just dipped to make these videos
Dang, you did squid kid dirty
DESERT ALL THE WAY because they worked togther and there king wasent power hungry

:/
"GuYs doNt be perUasded He Just have A AccEnt Booo"
Huh...well this aged bad
"led by the best potato farmer-" I'M CACKLING
Don't play with God
Quid kid still second best dayum techno did him dirty
He really did squid kid like that
2:21 you did him dirty there
minecraft genshin impac mod I dere you
Wow, enjoyed this story, new sub.
I wouldve liked jungle if the people werent stupid enough to choose ize..
Sequell!! Sequell sequel!!
"2nd best potato farmer" oof
4:53 does one of the holes in the greenery look remotly like a like button? Just me ok
o7 to squidkid, my favorite.
LMAO that guy who killed star is such a fool he actually thought he was good because he has armor and went baby rage mode when someone just said don’t go LOL
I was routing for jungle then they picked that guy to be king
actually punched my monitor when I saw ToDaY'S sPoNsOr ererererruruurru
love how the arctic were just chilling before they got invaded
Happy ize died. Wayyyy too cocky
I REAAAAAAALLY love how this going like. From three very start nations to the big three nations, and there is one strong-and-evil nation who want to beat two other. And the join nation, and the tactic and the happy ending. Just like a story! I really really love this!
Man,poor snow civilitacion,he was the first to die
this should be a real mc gamemode
Can I play next time please I promise not to grief
Love how he brought up the Second Best Potato Farmer title from the Great Potato War
frick soup (Silver plz subscribe)
“Lead by the best potato farmer, wait, I read that wrong”
Why are you only allowing people above 14 years?
Is that Mario Deluxe Theme Song?
Brooo that was sickkk
You killed it!!
As War hungry the Jungle Civilization was, them cutting the among us statue in half and even replicating the actual look of an actual dead body by placing white blocks instead of just griefing it entirely, made me respect them.
NGL I was rooting for Jungle ever since they got their king, I kind of admired his conviction, cunning, and no-bullcrap mentality.
The Arctic nation had life and that’s how they died
I have extreme loyalty to the arctic nation❄️🧊
35:50 LOOOOOLLLL
I love the desert
OOF 2:20
I loved when he put squidkid in his place at 2:25
There is nothing funnier than a irish man screaming soup
imagine if silver dropped a giant meteor in the middle of the region and the meteor can be mined for armor
Bro the zombie breaking out was awesome
Please do a second one, just found you, this is awesome
The king of the jungle was like the main villian
i was like wait, is that speedsilver? shit, i had no idea. always good to see OGs winning.
Plz add 3 new civilizations and all 3 are out of this world one civilization starts in the nether one starts in the end and one starts in the aether and the icon for the nether nation is fire ender eye for the end nation and elytra wings for the aether nation
Fucking incredible more and nut happen
Me and the boys hate ize
This must be one of the best Minecraft video trends to come out for a while
yo silver remember when u had 32k subs?
6:46  Starkiller98K: "Oh oh, these aren't people, these aren't people" Narrator: "and a huge battle with the natives commenced."
The abstract zombie was the true nvp XD
Something interesting that would make these simulate civilization videos more realistic is if once every 15 minutes or so, a new player could join for each nation, so populations could actually expand.
i LOVE the DESERT KINGDOM (mainly beause i am from the middle east)
RISE OF KINDOMS
The voting for the villages was weird, i feel like jungle should have gotten last, arctic was the best.
This litterally felt like an actual movie and you should TOTALLY make a second this was AMAZING
best minecraft civilization video of all time, great job Silver!
And also add natural disasters
And also add natural disasters
Rip Ize, my favorite right there
Also add unions and more civilizations
And also add an "heroic" class that makes players elect an player to be made into a hero also each class have their own hero type each hero class type gets different abilities
"The best potato farmer, wait I read that wrong. SECOND best potato farmer"   RIP i_am_squid_kid
and also add more government types like democracy and also add more classes
And also add corpses to the mode
38:26 WHAT THE F***
Someone should make an tech tree mod that is similar to civilization 6's tech tree to make simulation civilization more fun and realistic and someone should make an skin bonus mod where depending on the skin you use you get different bonuses and someone should make an mob domestication and weaponization and taming and someone should make an government mod to make civilization more realistic and all these mods have to be similar to civilization 6 and basically someone should make mods to make simulating civilization more realistic and fun
Lets take a moment for starkiller
my favorite team is the Artic
ah yes, "custom", because you didnt just completly steal someones idea.
How would moible players work on your public sever?
that desert zombie guy had like best character arc ever. prove me wrong
Ize  is so arrogant
Is ukraine in here?
jungle = soviet union
Star killer was better because he shared things instead of taking them like izi he was supportive and izi is a jerk
How do you get in stuff like this?
RIP Starkiller Long live the king
Glad the desert won. That jungle leader was a douche
First of I loved the video. Second I understand why they choose I's for there king ,but killing Starkiller was really just a dumb move on their part.
ARCTIC AND DESSERT IS GARBAGE
Dang it I was rooting for the jungle
Hello. I have something important to tell you,  The bible makes it clear that God is holy. This holy God holds a perfect moral standard. Sadly, we have all fallen very short of that standard(Romans 3:23). The penalty for sin/imperfection is Hell(Revelation 21:8).   Thankfully the bible also says that God is rich in mercy and grace. That is why He sent His perfect Son to die on a cross to save us from our sin. You and I broke God's law, but Jesus paid our fine. Then Jesus rose from the dead, 3 days later, thus defeating death! (John 3:16-18)   "He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 "But God commendeth His love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Romans 5:8
Hmmmmmm This seems awfully familiar
i think if the jungles 2nd in command didnt die to fall damage they might of been ok but the desert had so many people and had a pretty good advantage by being the last group the jungle attacked
2:54 FBI moment
Man, squid kid will never live the potato war down
The jungle nation was going hard! But sad they lost
This was awesome
Ize even though his initiative allowed them to wipeout the Artic, he was honestly a major asshole who intimidated people to follow him and his second in command ended up killing Star Killer for no reason when I'm sure he would have just followed since he wasn't King.
I  hope the disturbing person in the jungle kingdom fails in life
I thought jungle was gonna win, desert kinda 3rd paried in a fight with arctic and jungle
Can I join 1 of these civilizations things
This didn't age well
this is literally just magicgum's video but bad
bro the lore
N-no… it CANT BE Genshin players that AREN’T PEDOPHILES? AND ARE ACTUALLY COOL PEOPLE?!
This guys voice is very annoying
2:21 👀
What is the name of the first song in the background?
is this fvking Rise of Kingdoms?
the genshin music
desert its down 😡😡😡
That was so insanely good I loved that so much
im not i person to care for sponsers but ngl tht was a clean transition
These are literally soooo goood I love it
the Irish jungle guy calling your man a waffler lmao
Love the Genshin impact music in the background
Why was it playing genshin music
"2nd best potato farmer" OOOOOF
the fact that the jungle civilization even killed the among us statue is amazing
that squid kid diss dang
How dare they kill the pandas😠
Make more like this pls, i really enjoy this one🔥🔥
Legit can't stand people like the guy who was made he jungle king
Bad😈 👦  halo 👼
Arctic forever! Please make a sequel, it was more exciting than a complete american movie in cinema (probably Silver is the most underrated content creator, he deserves more attention)
WTF IS YOUR VOICE LMAO
this was so cool. arctic is definitely my favorite. they were so chill.
His accent drives me insane. No idea of where he’s from. South Africa ?
Honestly I was rooting for the jungle army when shit went down. This is how I saw the other kingdoms Jungle Kingdom - Dramatic with some weird story arc with the whole election, cool in my eyes Arctic Kingdom - Too Holly Jolly for my tastes, I don’t like em Desert Kingdom - Wish they kept the western town, I like west stuff, they seemed cool
I can't believe you would copy magicgum's idea down to the thumbnail lol
kinda favoriteism beacause wanna move to arctic when i grow up so arctic is good by far
I was wanting jungle to win
I liked starkiller
man was using genshin music as a bgm, very nice.
2:21 just had to take a jab at squid also nice reference to the potato War
Desert Kingdom was my favorite tbh.. since they dealt with what they had and were very civil with their crowning
Mr beast voice 21:52 to 22:14
I'm not a big fan of Minecraft but the video you created was amazing. Job well done
I love the Jungel Kings accent 🤩
jungle all day
The jungle was my favourite group. The most content was made there and the king election was just like Stalin's rise to power. I loved it!
Im pissed about the poeple that didnt vote for star and killed him
Jungle
I hated the jungle nation but happy that they did better then any other jungle nation in civilization experiments
I would want to join but I have Minecraft bedrock
Ize is a god tier leader
I think I have never payed so mutch attention to a minecraft video then this this is awesome
I cant be the only one who hated the jungle's asshole king like who the fuck does he think he is the only good thing he had for himself was his gear wich is something anyone can make the guy is covered with red flags otherwise. I would immideatly betray him by warning arttic or desert nations about their attack or something but I would never EVER fight alongside that dickbag. The guy has irritated me so much his ego is just out of this world when they killed him I got up screaming finally relieved that he did not get to win with his douchey tactics and died knowing that he could not fully elliminate either of the regions.
The genshin music during the video lmao
copying magic
This worked like the real word the country who started war started winning but then more democratic country's united and won
I feel like jungle would've won if their king was a bit smarter and geared up more for the 2nd battle
The jungle civ looked ass how did arctic lose
Awesome! I was rooting for desert the whole time! I’m so glad the jungle king died too.
L people GENSHIN IMPACT xD (Not a hater)
Jungle would've won if starkiller was king.
Poor jacktbc probally didn’t know what the heck was going on
Cringe sponsor
35:04 didn’t like that guy either
Man !! That's like damn real life 😆😂 but what i say more than "people are the same "  Your video is so great💪👌👏 i hope you continue doing it 😄
I like the Artic people because they had spirits and hearts and very kind, and I like The Desert people were very smart, teamwork, leadership was awesome for the King. *Bows*
i_a_squid_kid from technoblade's potato war
Kinda curious how they made a necromace laboratory for the zombie, so the zombie is like a loyal guard for the desert clan
These are some of the best Minecraft videos out there the production and entertainment is top notch
The desert was obviously the best I knew that the ice wouldn’t survive because they were memeing around and that the jungle would die because they were Always looking for war so the desert got thier well deserved victory
i honestly hated the jungle. desert was sick
ngl ize was a massive L in this vid, so annoying tbh
I bet you can't simulate a perfect working human brain in Minecraft using redstone for every neuron.    Please dew it.    Build the perfect Minecraft Artificial Intelligence.      Oh and please build Neuralink in Minecraft so Elon Musk won't need to.
<3
The donkey Kong country returns music 🎶 (18:30)
i was rooting for jungle at first until starkiller was assassinated and the tyrant too the throne,then i rooted for desert. this looked like so much fun lol
You've Really saved my life!! Before I watched this, I was convicted of 42 war crimes, mass genocide, terrorist attacks, robbing several banks, and 32 counts of reckless driving and grand theft autos. Due to those minor crimes  I committed, I was sentenced to life in max security prison. 2 days ago, the FBI and CIA were using me as bait to catch my buddies I've committed a total of 436 crimes with. Just as I was about to send the final text, this video popped up in the recommended. I accidentally tapped on it, then those moving words popped up on the screen. Once all the agents around me read it, they were in awe. They suddenly said I didn't deserve to be in prison, and that they'll give me 20 million dollars, and a free home as compensation for the crimes I did. I was amazed, and now I'm living in a luxury home! Thank you again for all the help you've provided to me!
OMG THAT ATTENTION TO DETAIL FOF SQUID KID AND TECNOBLADE POTATOE WARS
so glad jungle lost I hated the leader
The mario theme
These videos are much more interesting when they have actually good players participating, like ize and soup
That was way better than I expected damn
Hey squid kid, how does it feel being #2
R.I.P star
i liked the arctic one
Sus
even though the jungle leader was a total doushebag, he was definitely MVP.
Niceeeee
What edition
Do you play rise of kingdoms It’s a free to play a game with so many civilizations to go in the best one is the Vikings
Next time add artifact weapons like Thor’s hammer maybe a super powerful sword or trident
25:05 Player: *gets killed by a phantom* Silver: “and a player was caught off guard by a creeper”
Great vid
Wait squid kid he is rare to find
Bro lol ngl the guy from the jungle talks like xqc lmao
The kid who got “crowned” for jungle gotta be the most cringe MF. The kid was shouting about starkiller over talking other players, but that’s all he did. Had to mute the video when he was talking lmao.
24:05 you have the most health, you have the most gear When you die The enemy gets those stuff owo  Desert sounded mostly the balanced one Being good at military and being together at the same time oof
This was fun to watch, if you ever consider making a sequel, I suggest you include 1 more nation , making the player count for each region 25
The jungle civilization and squid kid definitely fueled the content but the desert kingdoms loyalty was a great addition
The genshin music tho🔥
This is crazy. Probably one of the hest youtube videos ive watched. Felt like a movie 🔥
Guys creepers fly now ig
I enjoyed watching this :)
Le monke
watching him isnt the same when he made skyblock videos
L for starkiller
Is a film... add to a Netflix guys
buttertoxin
Who would've thought that the one decision that required a 30 minute journey helped them win lol
These are my favourite ever
I liked the Artic the most
winter village could have eaten smelted kelp
i dont like the jungle king who attack Artic civilization
Noo!! Everyone was tricked in the Jungle kingdom. Haha it got me hooked!
The ravager idea was bad
I knew the jungle team would have lost to cocky and so terrible at being a team
2:20 “led by the best potato farmer- I mean second best potato farmer” gahdammit Squidkid cant escape the potato war can he 🤣
Desert Kingdom was my favorite for sure, absolutely love how the final kill was enacted by the only Undead Player Corpse
the most annoying sponsor in the world but i loved this video
Jungle people were like the Fire Nation from avatar. I feel it would have been more fulfilling if that Tyrant of a "King" had the death of the last jungle dude instead, he had it coming for him really...
I liked the artic for them basically being the comic relief. Kinda sad they died and the original survivors tried to betray the desert.
11:52 WOW this guy is scary! trying to enchant a FURNACE
5:00 That man sacrificed himself for the distracted people, what a legend.
So happy the team I rooted for won!
24:22 seems like Donald Trump and Joe Biden election type of business going on!😂
Awwwwwwww poor lone jungle desert guy😢😢😢😢
Silver is so popular now even big games like genshin impact sponsors him
imagine adding the rogue civilization, it auto puts you to rogue if you dont find a teammate or the village in 3 days (mc time) also it adds a trait that can control zombies or skeletons that you can use to raid villages/civilization
Jungle nation could've easily won with a good leader
Suep is salty
At first I liked the Jungle the best but it was starting fall apart and I moved on to the Desert
Dude you know magic gum did this first right?
Hey bro there's been update waiting for part 2
jungle king a total bozo and got what he deserved LMAO
Jungle
25:07 that wasnt a creeper..?
the jungle cilivization was by far the best
My man played america simulator in the first 10 min
Star killer is much better than u muffin head
HEEEEEEY this sounds like Rise Of Kingdoms
Never thought I'd be this invested 💀
Copied idea good job dude
abstrekt is the hero of his civilisation
I love the fact  that they can talk to eachother
R.I.P starkiller
This didn’t age well
The thumbnail seems familiar… HMMMM
Make a Nother civilization video
nice but water protection??!?!?!?!
i started watching this channel when it was at 58k now look at you good job
Omg this guy got sponsored by Genshin. That’s cool
I miss when i subbed at 5kk and u still did videos of skyblock :sob:
bro tbh i hated the king of the jungle kingdom
I would be a great leader
35:00 he deserved that
I liked jungle the most and desert the least
I rooted for the jungle nation until star killer was killed and eyes was leader.Then i rooted for desert
Magic gum copy?
When I saw squid kid my mind went straight to technoblade
Please make original thumbnails, thank you.
The thumbnail tells a story about what happens when a diamond is stolen
Awesome video please make more like it
Ice committed dictatorship
can you plssss do more of these i loved this
The among us statue is hilarious
Nice video!!
Im hosting a terraria in Minecraft server. Anyone want in?
Maybe I should get a Secret Decoder Ring too
We want more if this series now
bruh the thumbnail is almost an exact copy of magic gums videos
Is the background music was from genshin too?
I swear I have watched a video that was like this
Recruit technoblade to a animals tribe
NOOOOOOO NOT IM A SQUID KID. The best potato farmer, wait second best potato farmer.
This is the best video I have ever seen! good job!
I love that Irish guy what’s his name?
what an idiot that kid from the jungle region trying to betray his king and join the arctic because of his terrible judgment of how much sacrifice that needs to be made to ensure a nation future though yes i see where he's coming from because the guy was a terrible person but a great leader but then again its dumb of him to do that knowing the risks involved he acted based on impulse and emotions not calculated rasional decision sucks to be inexperience i guess
Jungle was too cocky, Artic was too cautious, and the Desert was just right in the middle. I supported Desert from the start *LETS GO*
Desert was my favourite
That Ice dude was just annoying af
i like these types of vids you def earned a like, a sub and a comment
Idea:  It's bad for people who built cool stuff, kept grinding and lose everything for just falling damage. It's just unfair for them! So why don't respawn "deads", but they can not do PvP anymore?
The jungle dude with diamonds had 0 leader skills 0 communication, social skills. Thought about himself and power only wanted to be leader for himself. Not others! And thought being arrogant, and having a big head would just instantly give him leadership without doing anything to prove to his people.
This guy ize is toxic asf
Dude it's so awesome it's like what I dreamed to do in minecraft plz do these again these are so awesome
HU TAO
Guys Pt.2 for this scary game is OUT NOW!!! Check it out make sure to subscribe if you enjoy if not leave a like and let me know what games you'd like to see!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpSEdQPmKFM

Hmm where have i seen this before?.... Oh yeah https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxZXCxixEOI&t=679s&ab_channel=MagicGum  fucking content stealer
That Zombie though, Mans still that loyal to his team. That is some sheer Willpower and dedication.
Mad respect to the zombie dude. Imagine being a zombie but it didn't stop you to protect your allies and eradicate your enemies.
Lag
Desert was my fav
The jungles leader was so stupid all they have to do was hide Intel the other nation kill domination only be two nations
Abstrect... Was the most loyal member
I didn't like moste jungel leder i didin't like junge not so like jungle kungs and winter and desert i like moust
The jungle invasion of the arctic kingdom was like russian invasion of ukraine not gonna lie
2:57 Dude genshin impact is soo good that I dont need to touch grass anymore.
I was so shocked when Seup went to help Ize
I got lost while watching which one are jungle and which one are dessert
Please part 2 love from india
Sub if are with desert region
Part 2 pls
This was sick!
Please make another one like this
Gotta love the Genshin music in the background.
this is really cool. if you end up making a sequel, you should do it with bedrock players and open a realm there. i'd love to join in on it if you do and i only have Bedrock edition, so it'd be pretty cool.
The desert
The zombie at the end was like “EVEN IN DEATH, I SERVE”
Who else has been here since 10k?
This video is 10/10 entertainment that's wait I wanted to see
#VivaLaJungle #LongLiveIze #InOurMemory
Yo desert all the way
Ize is such a stuck up big ego brat, literally has such a superiority complex
How do I play these games?
Bro  ize was rude a murdurer  and threatened his own citizens…. HE WAS A TYRANT
The Guy in jungle sacrifice 5:08
I think the jungle kingdom would’ve won if the Arctic forever and wouldn’t have joined the desert
bro i wish jungle won lol
This didn't age well.
He was using the same genshin combst music :0
fun fact i randomly wished in ghenshin impact and got the new 5 star
Worst video I have ever seen
funny accent
The jungle kingdom deserved the win
Jungle bc they would’ve win if they had more players
The concept was good, but politics ruined it kek
Jungle was the best and dudeeeeee better then dream smp
14:44 amazing xmas civilization hahaha
Jess my favourites deserts won
I expected order 66 from arctics at any moment.
I was actually kinda hoping the jungle kingdom would win lol
What would happen if soup didnt betray desert
I do wonder how many times I've seen a video like this 🤔
300 days as a safe shifter and and there's new bosses I want to let you know there's some 4 wizards the same but they're different bowling creator and nuclear and even lipper lipper and here's the boss's name  Fallen king  And nuclear fallen king and even the Creator  void reaper
I like jungle
that is really good and u deserve a sub
This aged pretty badly
This reminded me of ww2 bruh
one week later the thumbnail is real life....
NO SHOT. MY GUY PULLED A JIM JONES JOKE. NO WAY!
Bringing the zombie definitely paid off, gg
You gotta give credit to the jungle they had 15 or 17 people but managed to wipe out the artic and kill more than half the desert
I liked the jungle too
I like the  jungle civilization most
I am watching your vids since you had 30K subs! KEEP GOING MAN
ANOTHER ONE!!!!!!
Jungle was the best one
I'm bed sick I got poxes all over my body and my head hurts I think that I got a new disease. And sweating at one specific part on my body.
bruh just like ww2
Is anyone still waiting for u know yea but u know I won't happen 1.8 mil to like 300k but still hope :(
I like genshin impact (But i lost my save and i dont have enough storage)
The loyalty and determination of the artic players thoo
bro if ize waited till the blood moon jungle would win
What mod or plugin is this?!
Ok Ize maybe a tyrant, power-hungry monster, and a cunning warrior… but he makes for some good content.
AYO ABSTREKT THE ZOMBIE COME IN THE CLUTCH FOR THE DESERT TO WIN THO actually I hate the king of the jungle I mean the old king not Jack hes like so greedy
FYI Minecraft world is a cube
That Zombie was the life saver and the real MVP
genshin impact sponsor just ruined the whole point of me watching this video.
Keep making this video pls
The dude who lead the war from the jungle was fire asf He’s a dope war leader
Only if the ice kingdom join forces with the desert people earlier
bro squid got recked
Garbage, full of crying 8 year olds that can't accept winning conditions. Great effort from Silver but downgraded to a 2/10 by the players.
The zombie has highly loyalty to dessert kingdom
We need to take a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into these videos for us 💖
Jungle nation can be described by 5 words: People's democratic republic of jungle
I can't see Jungle Team winning the war, he's too selfish  Lol I knew Desert was gonna win (First to battle = Less Soldiers for the Final Battle)
Respects for abstract. No matter what he may look like, he will carry on his nation's pride forever.
I wish Jungle won tbh
Bruh this is crazy!  You're crazy!  Bruh this is too awesome if you ask me
Dessert
Make Ukraine and Russia fight
make more
Bro if I was there I ma make uhc trap witch you can attack people but they can't hit you and not only that they can't break out easily
I liked the jungle kingdom because of how they didn’t give uo
ZSPDPKSC3V8V5
honestly if the king of the jungle wasn't so reckless and if he planed the invasion then they could have had the dub
and i was rooting for jungle
MORE! I NEED MORE!
Perfect video for ucraine VS russia
Wow! Well produced video very high quality  Enjoyed it a lot! :)
I wanted jungle to win
noo jungle lost
I WAS HERE AT 9k keep doing what your doing
No one can beat techno?
I loved jungle civilization
You need to do this again but with eight factions and 240 people to give each faction 30 people
real life, but minecraft
I liked the artcic the most
This video is so cool
OOO I FELL THE POWER
When a yt gets the best loot in the game when they have a op sponsor
LETS GOOOOO I WAS HOPING DESERT WOULD WIN
A
this is masterpiece
The player that dead has possed the zombie hahahahaha the artic was my fav one
abstrekt was absolutely one of the best players in the game.
im so glad jg kingdome lost
Who will be won? 🤔
In terms of the end goal, which was to kill the other teams, Ize was a good leader. However he lost because he never supported his team in terms of gear and was too focused on his own power to win. Suep was my favourite 'character'.
Its so funny in 3 civilization the most funniest is jungle in the panda village a player said kill the panda who cares kill the panda im not making any statement nah im just messing it was hilarious
Technoblade is better potato farmer
Famous last words:I HAD A COW!!! I HAD A COW!!
I disagree with your choices
MF
The fact that there's actually war going on
I don't have twitter
necromancy for da win
The genshin music didnt really blend in well for me. Plus the end game content isnt exactly what most people were looking for. So yea.
2:23 WHAT?! THE BEST POTATO FARMER? TECHNOBLADE IS THE BEST POTATO FARMER IN THE WOLRD
DO YOU HAVE A MINCRAFT SERVER
l like jungle the most.
Abstrek KDA be like :   1 deaths 2 kill 2 assist
14:22 A dude: Yo, guys I’ll elect myself myself king, sound good? That one player: Um, *no.*
Nt Ize but u make this very interesting
the perfect time to make this kind of video LETS GOOO
Pls post more videos like this I really want this PLS OH PLS OH PLS
Absolute perfect example of civiliation. I love it❤️❤️❤️
Do more like this please i want this video
I was mostly focused not music for when you introduced us to the desert cause super Mario wii reminds me of so many times I played on the wii with my best friend nistolga bro
Instant karma for jungle there🤣🤣🤣
I kinda liked the Jungle nation most
good video but the trend is getting old
i liked jungle, but then changed my mind after the new king got chosen
Im team artic so sad
gg really good content
The Mario Bros wii's host are perfect🗿
The war Is there like Russia And Ukraine
The Fremen always win
Just sayin but make a smp where to revive you have to do necromancy and there is magic and magical creatures and there are classes:paladin,fighter,warlock,monk,etc and species too and it ok im just saying make a dnd smp…
I liked the ice kingdom and desset kingdom
Uh silver i havent watched the entire video but i feel like this is a spoke rip off?
i  LOOOOVE the opening animation
I ooioed jungle until star died
Tell me honestly the jungle king was the shittiest person I've ever seen (not the ending one , the one who won at starting) And yeah silver don't add these kind of people(the jungle king)
My favorite was the jungle! although i think star would be a better king..
The Desert kingdom is the only one that didn't fall to greed or betrayal
Make more civilization in Minecraft but to other players
Didn't expect you to use Liyue battle music as a background music
Yall taht zombie is lit
can u make another one but with 150 players causr i want it to be longer cause this vid is soooooo goood
This thing is Just Legendary , this Should be as an Historic Video of Minecraft
This was the best thing ever it honestly felt like a straight up Iconic Medieval Movie. But this now sets the standard even higher i hope you make another one of these just maybe with Zombies like if it was the Walking dead just with clans and shit
Jungle king is fokin virgin
please hire a different narrator.
I liked the dessert from teh start and knew that if the gg got lucky they would have best recoueces if lucky with the gold and temples but my favorite character was the artic king he was the like 2/4 good pvp and his plans were like God lvl iq lol smart plays
his voice and accent is a combination of german and british
I just finished raidens story quest XD 😆! Ar53, game is super fun!
Honest shame all the shady people were in jungle, if they had used ize military might as co king, and stars social prowess as official king, they could of conquered the world. but instead Ize turned on his own people. Ironic, the traitor met his doom by betrayal, a fitting end for a cruel king.
The king in jungle {I’m sorry to say} was an a****** for killing star
The Guy: Genshin impact ,if you're Watching this Hey guys! -AHH! *Dies*  That got me Laughing hard
doo more atleast make more civilization like 5 or something like that make more of this video
Dang
in the end, the hero is the zombie abstrekt.
none saw jungle its sus?!@?#!@?#@!?#😳😳😳😳😳
The jungle team is most scuffed team and I mean like being a team caus EU know there's literally a fight lol
dam this made me hate the tyrant king so much
I really thought Starkiller would win
I love the desert kingdom
This is scripted
I Just love these Videos ,it always makes my day better!
If only he didn't drop his netherite sword!
Players on the desert civilization have a unity
Tbh this was super fun to watch but super sad with the betrayals and stuff 😂😂
28:05 is literally Minecraft ww2 beach war
"I had a cow, I had a  cow!" :D:D:D:D:D:D
Jungle
35:50 Artic : Jungle just came and fuck all of us Desert : And you guys killed none of them ?  Desert : ...... Damn.   XD I was drinking my vodka and almost blew it to my screen cause of it
The jungle ary was great and had the potential to win more than the desert one , they should have won
Loved this video man, thanks for doing this (also 22:08 had me rolling)
Im_a_squid_kid flashbacks to potato war be like
Among us
This comment won't get 500M likes or to make it easier 3M
I think we all were routing for Jungle since the start..   SPOILERS! (If you haven’t watched full thing don’t read more)    I was heartbroken to see the Jungle king die. He was the best especially how he led his army. RIP.
I feel like the arctic kingdom had the best  village 😭
Jungle was best but they were only agreeing starkiller ana 1 just surrendered and died and made them lose 2 members otherwise jungle would w8n
I’m proud of desert’s team. Respect to all dead members of desert and the survivors
if i was you i was gan na help them
I'd liked desert civilisation most and suep is a betrayer
Ayo bro plays he shin impact xD
Please make more
i liked artic
This was awesome!
Was team jungle till the end
I un sub cause i like spruce you killed artic
My god, the jungle traitor was the most annoying guy to listen to.
desert is the vest
I was rooting for desert from the start. I never thought they would win because they were the first to lose players & besides, jungle was the most stacked. If starkiller had been elected jungle might have actually won.
So intence and like a story
Sad for Arctic they had such a nice little village and I was rooting for Suep. Great vid tho! I was in with the story! hope to see a part 2!
DESSERT
Desert kingdom were the best they are nice loyal kind and have a good leader with great a team quality
Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory tactics without strategy is noise before defeat  ~Sun tzu
When the next vedio will come
Damn I'm sad that the jungle team lost but that was an entertaining video, good job!
I like the jungle king
Let’s take the moment to appreciate how much effort Silver puts into his content for us. Great job
Tbh you are very unapricieated, you're content is wonderful man keep up the good work <33
38:04 I am constantly surprised by how few players change their drop keybinds to something that isn't adjacent to walk
Hearing genshin impact music feels so relaxing😎😎😎
Man I was rooting for Arctic they were doing so well
13:18  "I always come back" -abstrek
When I heard a sequel I want so has
OMG YES GENSHIN IMPACT! I LOVE THAT GAME! WOOOOO
I really wanna do this ;( it seems so fun i really wish i could do this
This guy single handen make the game unbalanced
Although Arctic lost Arctic's village looked the best. GG
My fav civilisation was Arctic, I liked their plans and buildings
the jungle people where really stupid if they did not betray the king they would have won
The jungle civilazition is just like the soviet union
I liked jungle kingdom
Tbh I was kinda rooting for arctic. They were so cheerful and peaceful, then they we're destroyed by the jungle. If you think about it you can win this game just by surviving for 1 month. Too bad arctic really were in good spirits, and were just trying to have fun
Great vid!
Okay but how is that fair? The jungle team would’ve won 100 percent if you didn’t make that rule they worked real hard and fought well
Arrgh... I wish the jungle team won
starkiller was best
We want Sequel
I absolutely HATED HATED the jungle king, stupid he was . That's why you wait for others to get weak instead of going on the offensive
the desert kingdom was the worst one
Hey can bedrock players also play
Bro spwid kid got rosted
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO JUNGLEEEEEEEEE
I love when the last jungle guy was dying he just accepted his fate and was like "have you ever heard of Genshin Impact?!?!"
Ize and his team reallyyy made this story that more entertaining and suspenseful
i am playing genshin while watching this video, the genshin music really confuses me, cause i wasnt in liyue and i am not fighting mobs, lol
Gemme robux
I liked liked the jungle Kingdom i whish i could've joined i would have built the coolest shit imaginable
jungle had no chance. Yeah they had gear but their leader was brash, too willing to chose a fight over a plan.
i love civilization in Minecraft videos, keep up the good work and make more maybe with 5 or 6 regions
silver, the puppet master above them all controlling the civilizations with the most power, has the ability to feed them but won’t, controls them to go to war on eachother, curses them with ravagers raining down, and all for one thing, content…. a true masterpiece of a story with an intriguing neaning
jungle can win if they gear up and train weaker member
I Wanna ask can crack account enter  your sever ?
Yo I need an encore I need to see the jungle win
jungle just pissed me off killing silver like that they fucked themselves over
When is the Next One Coming Out?
"Oh genshin Impact? Oh yeah baby!"
That was a great movie thank you
I miss your old UHC channel
Bro the desert kingdom was the kingdom i was routing for but I kinda thought they were gonna lose till they started regrouping their strongest and it was amazing to see the jungle kingdom get wiped
I love this video so cool aaaa i love this
Why did not you aploud your 200 days
Ize was such a Great Leader. He was a Good Man
The jungle and the desert
Does silverilization Is in bedrock?
Is no one gunna talk about how nostalgic the Mario themes are?
I’ll be in the next one
rise of kingdoms be like
Originally cheering for jungle but when star killer died i rooted for desert
what's his server's ip?
This is the Future of Minecraft Trends, If Your a Youtuber GET IN ON THIS 100 DAYS MINECRAFT CIVILIZATION
Really I like desert
I like desert kindom from the first I swear
i like his deep voice
He supported genshin impact * procceds to die *
The arctic was my favorite dude :(
Probark copy
I hated the jungle king😂😅
I was rooting for arctic, sad to see them die like that
I feel like a cool rule to add to these civilisation videos would be some kind of reproduction. Something like two alive players from a civilisation can agree to bring back one player from the dead every couple of days or something along those lines
I really luked star and i hate ize.
SOO BEAUTIFUL VIDEO 🤩🤩🤩
man this is such a cool guy concept
Wow, he really called out squid kid on that one lol
Liyue, sumeru n snezhaya be like XD
Jungle leader got too cocky, i liked his leadership but going for the desert nation instead of develop more was a mistake
{^_^}
....
When u said jungle at a part where the jungle poeple were attacking the desert people I though you said “german” instead of “jungle”
Blood moon.  Terraria players:hmmmmmmm something is familliar...
Man, that ize guy was just... An awful leader. And that ice General was kinda of an ass too
please make more civalisation vids
The fact that genshin impact music is in background.
Was that the legend squid kid?
Genshin is the best game to ever exist
I like the artic kingdom because them being jolly. Second is the desert because their neutral nation.
Jungle
Please just do another one again same biomes same constant please
30 minutes well spent
Always love videos like this! cant wait to watch it later
every one call techno he has to beat squid here also bring back the artic empire
im a warrior
Wait... i think i heard technoblade's voice in the king's election in the tundra
Myfav isartic
Sub to orange fox!
I love these type of videos!!
I really liked the desert plots and strategies
The zombie kill at the end was HALARIOUS
nice vedio
jungle
If star killer was still alive, things would've been different instead of a full on war, also, i felt bad for the jungle dude who hated ize and decided(welp, tried to) to join forces with desert
Jungle is Evil!
WOO HOO LERS GO DESERT
Not the Liyue genshin impact music! 😂🤚
Ize was a fearmongering tyrant leader that didn't deserve his crown. He led the jungle civilization to their doom and I'm glad he lost.
Can we have a modern one like not futuristic type but just like our era
i like dessert civilization
Desert
wait what happened to his old channel speed silver?
Why did I find the jungle king so damn annoying?
cool music
i think the Arctic has the e best town
Is nobody gonna bring up how this guy just stole MagicGum’s video without giving credit? By the time I’m making this comment Silver released this 8 days ago and MagicGum released his video 6 months ago… somethings up…
Omg if starkiller is still the leader of the jungle this war should not happen....but silver and the boys ty for entertaining us all
Yooo totally new video idea, never seen this before bro. Ok but anyway still nice to watch 👌👍🗿
I picked jungle firts but thrn i saw there ruthless king Being just so Aggro and stuff then i picked artic but hen they died then desert i feel so bad for the artic they got the worst loot chest and they got destroyed by the jungle
I was on jungle's side and thought they would win but was disappointed :(
this is great good job
ize was the true king
This was entertaining as hell
Can you make another one this was fun to watch
Bro this litterally is like a movie and the fallen zombie tried to kill the king is so beatiful man 100/10 bro please make this as a movie
I really like jungle nation they have a great show on politics just like irl? Anyways i like the starkiller guy but then i think his strategy is too passive like arctic nation, after the military coup the jungle empire became more powerful and agressive achiving total victory on the weakend arctic right after the blood moon its a shame they lost due to resistance,munities,unorganize,and low moral in his empire if he legit take the throne his country full might could have destroy the desert
now this is the content i signed up for
Forest is best🤞
This video was literally perfect.   We got to witness a literal assassination in a power trip Hahahaha. Well done lad.
I love the fact that he has the genshin music in the backround
Long live King Starkiller. A dream that should've come true... The Jungle King's Warmongering destroyed his nation!
I was honestly voting against the jungle nation when they elected the war mongering king, and had Starkiller assassinated. So I'm glad they lost.
Arctic
Who else got rickrolled???
I swear that desert temple is the same as the one I built but just less detailed dude
I like when you made classification, farmer, miner, warrior. I will likely to choose miner cause i love building and i would be able to gather building materials faster. I'm bad at fighting, I won't amount much in pvp :D
epic!!
SEQAULS
Pls do more
Man, I loved this video so much and I’d like to see more but I want rush you since it takes so long to make  Keep up the good work! :)
It's good to watch where arctic team were join the team desert instead of jungle
the jungle kingdom i think was the best but they attacked without a plan
0:09, xNestorio!
First off how the fuck did jungle win the snow village was by far the best second that squid kid bit at the start had me dying 😂
This is so good. With more advanced EPISODE style editing, this would be even better!
I would most likely choose warrior/builder since I’m good a fighting and building
Can pe or bedrock edition can join your videos?
This was so scripted but good
Finally a video that solev isnt the arctic region king
Artic team for life no matter what
It's funny how the jungle people saw the snow as a threat while the snow was already beaten up by events and was already making escape tunnels.
Genshit impact
24:11 considering the fact that they are the most armed amongst all the other civilizations I would make the strongest person there become leader, mainly because you want the guy with the most power to survive the longest to inflict as much damage to their enemy, the other guy running for leader has won the people's but that doesn't mean he'll be good at leading, maybe he'll be good at diplomatic relations but as I have stated they are the strongest faction/civilization right now so they mainly want to be playing aggressive but also win the trust of other factions to avoid being the main target of the other factions.
Hey make one for bedrock
man only the real ones remember the uhc days. we miss u speed
Noooooooooooooo jungle
How did that zombie guy able to control himself, anyway I love the whole video I was super focused on what was going on and hopefully you YouTube Channel will grow.
i hated iez. cocky and annoying just like that jungle guy said. star was 100x better
I liked the jungle civilization the most
"We would be losing if starkiller was king"-Eyes.
I really like this idea and I want to do something similar with friends but with no time limit
PLEASE MAKE A SECOUND ONE
Ayo why didn't you show me making my machines I made a flying machine and everything
The artic should have set tnt trap all over the town flip the switch and kill everyone including the jungle
this is a best content I ever seen fr
Bro this vedio is rise of kindomx in minecraft
Let's just appreciate this god-like editing
I wanted the desert to win since they have the disadvantage by not having any good resource
I was rooting for the Artic honestly but I'm just happy that Ize lost
I knew desert would win.
“Second best potato farmer”
Jungle is the dumbest group I've ever seen
so glad you added a couple hypixel skyblock jokes, kinda sad you left it
Honestly? If I had been that last Jungle player, I would have committed suicide after being crowned King. Give the win to the Desert, to spite Ize.
I would to love to see more videos like this
Arctic
his subscribers: WOAHHH GENSHIN IMPACT YES! I LUV IT!!! Me: booooo I hate genshin impact its the only game why my pc died my father's pc >:/
Those village votes were so rigged
like jungle land is good enough but it not enough for the jungle king
L desert W Jungle and sUeP
I read the thumbnail as race war and clicked realllly fast
Ize was no help to there team
Your videos are awesome but they go out rarely
lol hate that jungle king person
Miss the days of skyblock rip
Nice that squid kid is in this vid
Was originally rooting for jungle untill they killed Star killer and the ize became king, then I was rooting for desert bcs I hated ize
Bro even used genshin impact soundtracks lmaoo, thats dedication
My fav is the Arctic nation cuz they are fun
Bro best video I've seen in a HOT MINUTE I'd love to see more videos like this
Can we just talk about how he’s playing mario music in the background in the beginning
Ize was pathetic tbh. The jungle kingdom already bagged the competition. He got too cocky
40:28 you forgot to give credit to TrixyBlox, it was his transformation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nobiwR1y434
more like RISE OF KINGDOM🤣
Part 2 plssssss
I never bored watching genshin ad lol
jungle leader corrupt
The fact that the zombie that that guy spend minutes to bring back did damage to help his kingdom is such a masterpiece
I Made 100 Players Simulate Sex in Minecraft...
you know, I actually think that Ize did a really good move in invading the artic. You can say that he is a cruel leader who slaughter all his who dare to take over his throne. But it is however a necessary thing. It just his wrong move to attack the desert when his advantage of surprise have already gone. This video will be so boring without him!
How is weakening ur own nation gonna make u achieve victory 🤨
I wanted Arctic to win
I was a big fan of Arctic but theyr betrayl made me change my mind for Desert and Im just happy that the Jungle agressors didnt won 👀😅
desert had necromancy no one stood a chance
at the start its all music from super mario bros u delux
THE POTATO WAR REFERENCE THOUGH
I was routing for the dessert
The thumbnail is literally currently happening right now
Really wanted the Jungle Kingdom to win for some reason!  I just loved the rulers commitment and moral tbh
KNEW IT DESSERT WON
Love it
One of the best videos I’ve ever seen bro. Holy
It's time to blow up the fucking nation
Good job keep it up
Jungle was pretty much russia
The fact that he inserted Genshin OST's is just muwah
I feel like if star was elected jungle could’ve won as he had no intention in war just peace and gathering he could’ve gathered mass amounts of loot and he was smart so he could’ve lead his troops to victory
I want to see a ceqel
Jungel
27:59 what song is this?
I liked the jungle tbh when star something was in charge
Awsome
Nice video always liked this kind of video
He rekted i'm a squid kid by calling him the second best potato farmer. Lol
Hell.
Jungle could have won but they didn't try to form a choke point for them which if they played their cards right and baited desert in a choke with the king and a few warriors they could have won with a good flank after the bait
Dang I wanted jungle to win
9:03 POV: you said you were underaged
Dessert
I thought this wasgud vid but genshin impact WHAT THE FUCK
please come back to skyblock speedsilver we need you
I hated the jungle kings attitude tbh😭
I routed so much for the jungle it would have been epic if the last king killed all 11 remaining players XD
To the person reading this: Even though I don’t know you, I wish you the best of what life has to offer 😘
If only starkiller was the king...
You know I believe jungle civilization can win at all if they weren't too greedy, because they have a lots of wood because yeah it's jungle , man I hope starkiller is being nominated as a king you know . I believe he can lead jungle civilization to win it all. BUT THANKS TO YOU, I HOPE MANY MORE CIVILIZATION GAMES TO YOU
that was such a good plot twist
I loved this, pls make more
Russia and Ukraine War Everyone Taking About the War In Russia and Ukraine
The Jungle nation looks just like German in World War 2 , they started the war and got eliminated
Please make a another video like thai
Do u have a discord
The PLOT!!!!! Game of Thrones could never!!!
Sounds like Last Life.
DUDE  THIS VIDEO IS SOO FUN IT REMINDS ME OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS AYOOO
Fucking hate ize. Star should've won, and I'm disappointed that the people voted on him. Manipulation works, but at what cost?
Even though the jungle was ruthless, it was all for victory and tbh the remaining arctic players also have a couple loose screws too, and the desert in my opinion was a good civilization but they were just the peaceful type… but ima have to take the jungles side
i think star killer would have been going for resources
Please do more 100 player videos 🙏🏾
sure il sub
Hi squid kid
Starkiller was about leading and making sure his kingdom lives, ize was about power and winning which lead to his downfall
I wanted jungle to win
Hey, Silver! This is a great video for players! Love your effort in coming up with this. Wondering if you guys are also into NFT and have heard of Starlight NFT?
I honestly think starkiller should have been king
Technoblade,  xNestorio is a good YouTuber, PrestonPlayz,!?
I'm trying to do this as well can u guys help me complete this ( I need about 96 people tho)
Jungle = communism + war crimes Desert: Democracy + water drout Winter: Democracy + Artic regions + water dropped t
Can you play this on bedrock? And if you can how
21:00 children screams are hilarious
you deserve a subscribe
Your know I really did like this video accept for just one little thing. YouTuber TrixyBlox a little while back made a custom desert temple. This temple you put in your video without any credit. That is just completely messed up and I don’t like it.
Should add a relationship feature. Where two players have a rare probability of rebirthing a dead player.
More of this pls,😭
The jungle king leader was a wanker
Did i hear squid kid is tge first best potato farme- nvm its econd
ize is so mean lol
Lol poor Squid Kid
9:02
I hate this Ize guy
Sneaky way to sponsor Genshin Impact by using its music, am I right?
YOO IS THAT PRIVATE FEARLESS????
I like jungle
My favourite was dessert
This was literally like a movie and I can't stop watching it
I liked the jungle ‘till that brat of a leader was crowned king
Jungle had the worst leader
This is an absolutely fascinating view into human psychology and socialogy. Jungle was my favorite view - the first guy was oozing being a slimy rat with his 'you do an amazing job' But diamond doucher's takeover was worse. Loved it all
The jungle guys reaching on the beach was literally Day D but in minecraft.
PLEASE DO ANOTHER ONE THIS WAS AWESOME
next time 1000 player
Is it just me or do almost every experiment of this sort end with the nation with the most resources being the one to have the most inner troubles?
ngl, Arctic was the best one
6:45 Spaniards in 1492 after coming to America by accident and then making a huge ass genocide
Squid Kid hahahahah
When I first watch this I would think the jungles will win but no
russia can pet bear like ravenger
5:51  "I can feel my *POWAH* "
I WAS SUMMONED FROM GENSHIN IMPACT FANDOM HEYYYY
The jungle king was by far my favorite character, I liked the betrayal and the killing of the competition, idc if he lost he won content wise.
i think its medieval ages
Sequel
As sequel would be nuts. Make them name their towns and split into to 4 civilisations. This would be insane
Please make a sequel to this. That was amazing man
This is like rise of kingdoms lol
Artic:Canada  Jungle:Vietnam  Desert:Egypt And this is so coll
“See if starkiller was king then we’d still be eating carrots” Yea you tell yourself that bud how’s that defeat taste
Is this bedrock or java
make one where its tribal where  25 people pr tribe and half way in people can make city's/nations so its even more intrusting. also you cud make some tribes more war focus or more economics to spies up the beginning. I just thought it might be cool but it's your choice in the end.
they should know how to breed (not animals... players)
Best clip ever 22:27 😂😂😂😂😂😂
IS 3 PPL REALLY FOR CONTENT, THEY JUST JOINED FOR FUN NOT TO DIE IN A SERVER
Bro Jungle Civilization is like Sparta
I need to see more >∆< but make it 200 players yea know 😋
i was rooting for them isnce the begiinning
2:08 This cave is not a natural formation.
Is there a way you can add builder roles who are given schematics like boating docs, walls, town houses, prison, roads, and a bunker? I feel like it would greatly enhance the experience making defenses in civilizations more important and stuff. Idk just sounds like a cool idea like builders can see like a hologram of a selected schematic
Don’t do my man’s ImASquidkid like that xD
Suuuuuure. YOU created that map… 💀
Squid Kid is by far the best character in this game
Do this again I really enjoyed it
ROK In minecraft be like
This is Insane
Why does 12:46 remind me of how ww1 started?
this dude just copied this idea from some other dude
I think he forget to credit magic gum, this was originally magic gum's idea. Pls put him on your comment or even description, plagiarism is not cool bro.
this is a big example of tribalism also do one where the different nations are mobs
Genshin is bad
We need a sequel to this masterpiece
Gotta love those mario sound in the background
I kinda miss the times when you made vids abt skyblock :/
hi
2:23 what a diss
I can’t imagine how happy abstrakt was when his corpse killed 2 people of the most powerful nation
i actually despise the jungle king
Please please start a new series of this!
Imagine techno being in this
The jungles are coming! The jungles are coming!
I love how the different civilizations have different personalities.  The arctic kingdom was more laid back and not really serious about the challenge. They were just there to have fun  The desert kingdom was more serious and organized. They were smart and knew what to do  The jungle kingdom was a little too invested. They often backstabbed each other and we’re really aggressive with one another
PLEASE PART TWOOO
An election, a political assassination, the militarization of a country, a forced draft by threat of death, and an empire done in by its own warmongering. In Minecraft. What a great game.
This is another reason why you don’t mess with desert people they’re just built different
Can you please make another simulating civilizations video? If you do then can you use the mountain, swamp, and forest biomes instead of the ones in this video?
LED visor best potato farmer I read that wrong second best potato farmer
Eyes should of been the war general
my guy did squid kid DIRTY
Nice job the amout of players there are and there epic battles is insane it must have taken a while great job.
2:22 LMAOO
Ok, this has been done millions of times, can we get something special please?
LE MONKE
ah i hope you guys use guns next time (ww2)
Do more  like these videos
Sequel pls
do more of this
Stole it straight from ish but ight
yo plsssss make more of these
We need more videos like this chief.
Techno be like u say that I’m the second BEST  POTATO FARMER EXCUSE ME
jugle
If there's something i love about those civilizations in Minecraft videos is that people just randomly generate Culture out of nothing
Do this again
it insane how the mod actully worked
I feel like I’ve been watching a movie this is so high quality good job 👍
Bro when the jungle Nation invaded the artice nation I was like CHARGE!!!!!
I really liked the politics in the jungle and also how the brave jungle king died by the artic people, that was heroic.
bruh starkiller needed to win lol
Number 5 Burger King foot lettuce
Make one with Rome, Vikings, Egypt, Native Americans, and Europe
I used to watch your skyblock content. You've grown so much jeez, keep on going!
I tough u become minecraft fearless last vid was 2 motnhs ago
Jungle forever
Van you pls make more of these
Ngl I loves the jungle king, I was so happy when they killed the 1st civilization. They played so dirty, the jungle people didn't lie to their enemies. But the survivors did and betrayed the dessert kingdom
Wow, the jungle diamond guy really knows how to make people hate him
12:25 My dude sounds like mumbo
Jungle
No nether? You give them a month? I would have been fully enchanted with god gear in a week….
Desert was defiantly my favorite there complete cooperation with each other and sharing of recourses boosted there military might to victory
I liked the artic more
Make a second plz
I'm surprised the Artic did not win the base competition. It was really cute and I really liked their ice rink.
35:51  - Gosh lmao
That jungle king definitely is 400lbs and sits on his ass all day want a loser
14:20 "im gonna elect myself king" "uhh noo" best part idk why xD
ZSPDKSC3V8V5
"Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell—and great was its collapse!”  (is what Jesus said)
This kid who became king of Jungle IS SO ANNOYING, literally the last person you want to be a leader
Stopped watching when genshin impact sponsor started
man did squid dirty
Why am i watching this video right when Ukraine is getting invaded by russia💀
Ukraine vs Russia Be like
World war 3?
i like the music choices
Nooo I was rooting for the arctic
Iz and saitama never deserved leadership
idk why but i love this mans voice luv the vid :)
Inevitability sacrificed himself to save other people
I miss jungle
Bro ize is so dumb he’s just a terrible dictator
The jungle king was dum
I am telling tecno u said squid is the most good potato farmer (TECNO)
Love it
I like the genshin Inazuma boss fight song in the background 🤣🙏
Two years,qnd squidkid is still known as second best
"Best potato farmer" *Realizes its Squid Kid "Second best potato farmer"
You should add the assassin role
At least he said techno was the best potato farmer
Honestly I wanted to see Artic win but man I wasn't prepared for the zombie member to actually be the MVP in Desert so I'm glad they won
I always root for desert
On start i hope jungle will be most peasefull. On the end that jungle was most agressive. Interesting.
This is actually nice minecraft content like Minecraft civilization episode 1
ngl i kinda hate that ize guy
I liked the Arctic alot
Genshin impact he’ll yeah
I knew the dessert would win from the start, I had them in my mind the whole time.
Nerf Miner 1:38
Isn’t that the fortress in the hobbit from lord of the rings?
There is always one person in these things that tries to take over everything makes me sad
Subbed bro! This is my first video with you and I really like the content so far!
Sooo cool! Well done 👍
Ha that jungle kings loss felt sweet
If I was in one of these videos I’d lead my team to make a castle, not just for aesthetic purposes, a proper defensive castle with loop holes merlons, maticulation, towers with turrets, gatehouse, moat and a town to go around to win that town contest.
The desert civilization was underrated but it won. Underrated stuff is gold.
How did he make the world
AS IF IT WAS NOT BAD ENOUGH FOR THE SNOW VILLAGE LOSING THE SUPPLIES YOU PUT A MOB KILLING THREE PLAYERS WAY TOO GO YOU JERK!!!
this is so well made!
The desert
this should be an actual minecraft server.
This is just a copy of another video
This is just adventure time elements
"peace" that's slavery.....
do a sequal please
Silver: followed by the BEST potato farmer Looks at squid kid Also silver: wait . . . SECOND BEST potato farmer OOF you killed him with that one
Arctic team was actually brainless lmao
15:21 this is way to fucking relateble 😂😂😂
Anybody notice that he used a Mario desert theme when they went to they desert
Dude I saw MagicGums civilization vid and I immediately hoped that this would happen more. thank you for doing this. Now I need to get a PC.
ize really is the worst
jungle was so close
I was hoping Artic would have a better ending. They just seemed so happy and wholesome lol. At the same time, they betrayed the people who took them in, and Desert was also super wholesome. Glad that Jungle lost though!
Please make more
I love the ice!
I was with dessert from start
Rigged
This is one of the best Minecraft videos i have ever seen
bro desert were the most boring
I agree with you! I was rooting for jungle too
Hi silver u can make a minecraft civilization server like this video but more teams and respawn idk if u understand me  And idk if u like the idea
Sequel
I watched the whole video. Great story telling! Honestly didn’t realize how interesting these type of videos could be
you need part 2
those guys who killed star and started a war are annoying
Just like Ukraine and Russia
bravo for the desert kingdom for killing that jungle king a*hole!
What’s da seed
Why we will play Ganshin impact when we have minecraft babyyyyyy
I feel bad for Artic it's such a wholesome group:(
My favorite civilization is probably jungle but I do still like the another ones this is an awesome video good job
The desert kingdoms forces fight to the very end, and sometimes beyond.
Plz do more!
Les by second best potato farmer squid kid 💀💀💀
The jungle literally became "the bad guys" and i think that rocks
There must have been a dictator who did exactly the things Ize did in this video. Assasination, military coup, Invasion of a neighbour and ultimately leading to its country's downfall.
I subscribed to u when u had 100k aubs
Fantastic video, well organized and very well done managing all that stuff. Great work mate.
hey silver how do i join minecraft experements like these is there a discord?
Bruh those stacked guys who wanted to kill starkiller are  those toxic people who just can't let everyone else have fun
100 people isn't much at all
Jungle got what they deserved :)
epic!
Felt bad for the players that was in the jungle region. Their king really spoilt the fun.
25:06 caught off guard by a creeper? thats a phantom, not a creeper. Amazing vid tho!
Jungle
Great video btw make youre custom videos a mod so we can use too
really REALLY clever idea.
I would 100% subscribe if you continue doing these civilization videos. May even be a part of one. We shall see.
This is the coolest Mc video I’ve watched in awhile, it felt a whole story playing out, I mean it had political discourse, a tyrant, betrayals, plot twists, side stories, a zombie helping his team, and what makes it better is it wasn’t even scripted! I honestly do hope you make a second one cuase this was really fun to watch!
I really want to be in the next vid love it !
wtf this is a blaitant copy of magic gums video, why are all the coents posotive
Jungle was my fav since start but their king was selfish. He should have waited in his area.
"gosh"
The arctic was my favorite! I used to like jungle until the king event.
more
squid_kid knows tecnoblade silver i also subed and liked
i love this so much this is so cool
Vladimir Putin was inspired by this video.
Snow civilzation, the susmas tree was perfect!
ARTIC ON TOP!!!!!
Rip starkiller
Ize got what was coming to him for his brutal and selfish tactics. And for all his smack talk he lost. Would of loved to see how jungle with star as leader would of faired. By default they would of lasted longer if they didn’t attack during a blood moon. (Such a bad idea, it ended up not too bad but could of been so much worse)
Very original xd
"I will Make The Archtic's great again" -Chunglboi
20:00 but the jungle was already so stacked that’s so unfair 😫
MOOOORE i want more civilizatiooon
wow, i first like the artic because they were wholesome. but desert's necromancy is kinda cool too!
Let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his content for us.Great job.,
jungle jungle
I would genuinely watch another one of these videos I love it’s great job everyone
5:00 guy was a hero
i hated ize from the start
The jungle kingdom's story is sad. A tyrant king never prospers.
Have been watching your speedsilver channel on hypixel skyblock before but i didnt think you are going viral on your second channel now your main.
They need a mode like this now lol that was awesome
I was really rooting for Ize, he was logical and had common sense when it comes to mc war. Sadly he didn't win
I HAD A COW, I HAD A COW, I HAD A- *dies*
this didnt age well
Who here remembers speed silver and when this channel only had 10k
How can I join your minecraft civilization?
39:44 into the vid and i belive in the new jungle king >:) NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i voted for artic but they lost. If you were artic i joined the desert i think. Btw really good video
Love the genshin soundtrack
first i like the jungel kingdom but they got a cocky leader so I don't really know
how can i join  ;:D
this aged well
I liked the jungle the best
Three kingdoms built up. The jungle which was led by a charismatic leader who cared for his people. The Arctic that lived happily and enjoyed their time peacefully. The Desert who struggled to live but eventually strived and exceeded their environment, getting creative with their surroundings. All three kingdoms living peacefully until a greedy and ambitious person undermined and assassinated the charismatic and caring leader where he then forcefully took control of the jungle kingdom and ruled with am iron fist as a tyrant leader. Soon after leading his followers and the other reluctant kingdom to attack the peaceful arctic kingdom. Catching them off guard and slaughtering all but 5 of them. Among the 5 was the general of the Arctic kingdom that was the only one who managed to slaughter 2 of the jungles warriors I'm his escape. The refugees escaped the slaughter and made their way to the desert kingdom where they managed to join forces as the jungle kingdom started their invasion. A fierce fight erupted between the two sides with many of the desert warriors dying I'm the ensuing panic. Unbeknownst to them though. Two of the Arctic warriors who joined them have been staying to themselves and letting the others het slaughtered until they finally decided to help I'm the end to fight back. After many of their people had fallen, the desert kingdoms best warriors gathered together and teamed up to hunt down and kill the jungle kingdoms weakest warriors, successfully thinning out their numbers until the king was left all alone. As the king fought back with his strongest armor and weapons, A member of the desert kingdom who had died long ago only to resurrected by his dear friend as an undead, escaped from his captivity and rushed to the aid of comrades, fighting against the tyrant king. The king desperate to survive ran away from the warriors eventually finding aid with the general of the Arctic who had decided to betray the desert kingdom to aid the man who slaughtered his comrades. However it was all for naught. With the aid of their Undead comrade and their greatest warriors, they were able to cut down the Tyrant King and the Traitorous General. Eventually after the conflict was brought to an end they managed to capture the Jungle Kingdoms last surviving member. Bringing him to the throne room where he would be executed, the last remaining member decided to blow everyone up with him, I'm which he failed. After disarming the War Criminal, they had him executed by their Undead Comrade Abstrakt. Killing him and finally bringing peace to the land, free from the reign of a Tyrant King and free of bloodshed. The Desert Kingdom had won.
2:55 you are playin cringe
Soooooo good man pls keep it up
Why didnt somebody just go to the end city and get the elytra
Damn, this ize thing is a piece of s...
9:00 man sinned, ngl
We need more content like this ! Such a good idea
nestor
the jungle leader is a dictator but I love th ice kingdom
man i sure miss the hypixel skyblock content
I liked the Arctic cuz the sus imposter
I think the jungle was falling apart. also would live in dessert if I could chosse one because the were acctullay guite civilized and did not undermine their people.
I was routing for the jungle nation until ize___ took over. Then, I was all for the desert.
i hate desert kingdom and it made me not like this video
ngl, im so glad that tyrant king died
Desert!!
tecnoblade is the best potato farmer
Plug-ins?
Jungle :(((
In 2:16 he just placed diamond blocks
Thank you silver for entertaining us
I was cheering for jungle at the beginning, but as soon as ice ascended to power, I supported Arctic. Honestly, it was sick of the jungle to attack the peaceful arctic players. It wasn’t a fight, it was a slaughter.
Continue pls
Bro this is so gooddd
Please make more this civilization content. I really enjoyed this 🧡
need more
this didn’t aged well
4:20 “As Flash was tec-

Danget me and my friends were watching this and we all bet on 1 team and my one friend let's call him Jake he bet on arctic my other friend let's call him Finn he voted on desert and I voted on jungle and we all said that whoever team won would win 20 dollars and that's how I lost 20 dollars to my friends
Dude sounds like phone guy 12:14
desert
börk
*Let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his content for us* 🙂🙂❣
I’ve artic people
How long do 100 Minecraft days last in the real world?
I was rooting for snow tribe so technically i was right if you count refugees.
Rip star killer
I liked the Jungle most they made very nice progress but they lost in the end
Ize, Just makes me angry he's so power hungry!
When i saw this video i was playing genshin impact lol
I can hear the OST genshin impact
Silver being a god and make the US Asia and Europe and other country lol
What happened to the last snow guys?
Was there a script, or is it all legit? Anyway it was an awesome ride especially the Forest biome residents. I was rootin for Desert coz they pretty much don't have anything
This video is so fimiliar... Its almost as if it wasnt your idea... I wonder..
9:03 😦
can i be a part of you civiisation video pls
BRO MAKE MORE CONTENT LIKE THIS
MAYBE MAKE THIS A TOURNAMENT AND THIS WAS THE FIRST ROUND
That Zombie was a total BEAST!
oh, i amlmost forgot. my favourite civilization was Arctic :)
Jungle
what plugins u usin
How do you make people join your server?
Can I come on the server
i loved the snow kingdom because of the among us statue XD
I was rooting for jungle and got so disappointed in their performance in the invasion of desert
wow.. just wow
The General was kinda a duche.
Ize was honestly such an L. Like it added some spice to the video but I would have hated being on the jungle team 😅
I think jungle would have one if star was the king
Best nation is snow LOL oh yah the guy who brought zombie carried LOL
I want to join cuase it's super fun hehe
I like
Jungle look promising ngl lol
Love thumbline copying
I KNEW DESERT WOULD WINN!!!!!
i was rooting for desert all the way. Jungle was my least favorite since all they wanted was war. Desert wanting what was good for their nation.
So. Different regions, permanent death, supply drops etc. Its just arkham city
Pls Let me be part of the jungle Team next time plsssss
Subscribed you deserve it
we need new one like this
Joungle
Okay the Jungle King was ruthless and lead his people to war, they seemed unstoppable and they were. But in war, the smallest mistakes and the smallest change could turn the direction of the battle.
Squid kid be like emotional damage..
hey, silver did i need minecraft premium to play minecraft civilization?
Who else wanted the jungle and arctic to win but mostly liked the jungle? I used to think the jungle was best but when they massacre everybody I wanted the desert to win, as it was the only hope to save the world from the jungle kingdom. I thought jungle was a good one but turns out they are just bloodthirsty people. I am sad how ice was so greedy and killed star killer to take place of king. But it’s funny how desert just makes a dead person become a mobile, and it attacks ice- and the last jungle player. Might aswell call it ancient Egypt. And speaking of ancient, GENSHIN IMPACT IS A ANCIENT GAME PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION  TO GENERATION.
I loved the cocky way of the jungle king and everything he's done for the kingdom.Salute!
it was kinda unfair for jungle cause they got out numbered so i think it should have a redo
I was always with desert but i was scared that the jungle might win
Woah the Desert civilization is so strong and they even have teamwork they help each other which leads them to victory
DESERT LESSSS GOOOO
to be honest, i loved the Artic and Desert builds, i like how Artic civilisation members made things for other players too, not for themselves or nothing like Jungle. but i didn't liked how a member of their team betrayed them
Always remember to say the SECOND best potato farmer BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!
Silver : Jump if you like Genshin Me : **falls through the floor**
I love the artic team and at the same time I hate the jungle team....
Thoses Jungle guys where the best
This is one of the best civilization video I have ever seen. Good job
I liked the dessert the most
genshin impact music is great but a terrible fit for this video
Ngl I've watched multiple mine civ vids and yours is definitely the best!
jungle
I would love to join
wow it was like real nations. betrayals, companionship, leadership, ect were represented in this video. hoping for more videos like this in future.
I rooted for the desert
what genshin impact
I was rooting for the Arctic, Suep betrayed jungle too though
me being a genshin impact player: 300000000 LBs
This editing is astonishing and the vid idea is pretty awesome. Didn't know how I had ent find this channel before
How can I participate?
Ize is just way to political. He does act cocky, and he lost the war. This is what happens when you are forcing upon everyone
Starkiller should've been king. I think it would went way smother if he was king.
its like hunger games
Rip starkiller
I don't like how the jungles leader took charge by first causing ruckus and stealing loot, then forcing himself as king, willing to kill his own teammates, then got his entire team killed because he wanted to win by ending the other teams
sit
Old make more
Ize's Attitude is abit like ugh cause like he is the type of guy who wants power and like i feel bad for the person who wanted to be the leader :(
"I've put in more to saving the zombie than I do in my school work", paraphrasing the player who was playing God and didn't know it
Sequel now
Jungle they deserve the win
they did the jungle dirty by 2v1‘ing
Saw this on my recommended, really glad I clicked on it. This was awesome
remember that Speed used to play Hypixel UHC and skyblock... I miss his old vids
THE ABSTRACT UNDEAD
Please please silver make more videos we want to see a lot of videos from. Your channel.Imagine getting a heart.
I got an ider for a foutcher video  this is Ider a country's thing
I support jungle
This was amazing ı love it I wanted soup to win but yea desert works too
Ize pissed me off
I think i like this series sow a want more video like this
Did I just see a certain Timedeo on the server 👀
2:16 i like how he just placed the diamonds lol
:O I play Genshin Impact. It's an amazing game.
Did I just witnessed a genshit impact player?
civil ware? OMG  i cant speli0ng
I liked the Desert from the beginning, I loved everything about their nation.
THIS VIDEO WAS SICK
im still laughing my a** off because im_a_squid_kid just got roasted
The Jungle King metagaming to charge instantly was annoying and his arguments over Starkiller weren't logical as he himself didnt let others talk
make more of this pls
Amazing video
I wonder if I could play minecraft but I can't because my dad sayed "you or not allowed we need to save money!" HE said mabye it's a good idea
I play genshin Before this vid came out
Im better in building and who anoys me am gonna be angry
we need more this type of vedio
9:03 “Everyone Jump if you do not know the age of consent”
the jungle civilization is absolutely ruthless
I hated the jungle team from the start
I see videos like this and it reminds me that I suck at Minecraft.... while I just didn't put in the time to do much useful, I still get a kick out of watching people play.  A very cool scenario this uploader plays out, too.  I'll sub for a job well done!
I wish I will be accepted into the next event
I always wanted to made this in Minecraft ✨
The zombie is killing the king of the jangle
I liked the arctic the most
Hahahahahahaha 😹😹😹
Dam your video editing skill are fascinating 👌🗿
Good video but imo placing ravagers to the last place was a really jerk move bc it's artificially ruined balance
that irish guy was insufferable
How Did Genshin Sponsored You :0
How do i join these?
Desert is the Future
i’m sorry but the transition into the genshin ad made me giggle bc i jolted when i heard teyvat…THE BATTLE MUSIC TOO
I knew desert would win
i like how the bgm is genshin batle music
Thought it said "race war" LMFAO
Hey silver, could you revive your skyblock channel: "Speedsilver"?
great video
Team dessert
tbh I was rooting for jungle their military was goated they just didn't have enough people
wait if abstrekt died at the begin to sand then why is he a very cool person zombie
Jungle king is Chaos he might be a Dictator or something 😆😂
This better be the plot for Minecraft the movie
dude starkiller would have been a great king
Squid kid is in it
I'd love to take part in this I won't lie.
Anyone saw Infernally like me
I kinda feel sorry for the Arctic Kingdom ngl
i like the jungle because its civillation is the aggresive but if starkiller did not get killed probably they would play safe and didn't attack arctic but for my favorite king is desert because ize is not fair becuz his friend killed starkiller and forced his ally to go to war
You just stole this video and thumbnail from MagicGum.
I wanted ize to win but gg to desert
I don't watch minecraft but this was cool af
pls do more like thisssss
that guy ize sounds like he was beaten by his alcoholic dad
My favorite civilization was arctic even though they didn't win they had a strong bond and nothing can kill that
Why desert wins every video like this ??
You didn't credit the person with this original idea [MagicGum]
I don't like the jungle nation's leader it's more like a boss of thiers
26:43
Bro i hate ize i wish he was never in the video
Dude ize is so fucking toxic
I was rooting for the good guys pretty much first was the Arctic but then I was pissed becuz of the jungle attacking the Arctic so I started rooting for the desert and I absolutely love how they killed the last jungle member
how can i partecipate in one of your videos?
I noticed Xnestario joined or it is a decoy
if is here squid kid is there to technoblade? xD
My favirote region is the arctic
Please a part 2
I just love these kind of mc vids
He just did squid kid like dat.
only artic civilization
0:08 see anyone? :)
Desert kingdoms are my favorite
Starkiller vas killed
I like how he was using genshin music while explaining what's happening with the jungle region
I liked artic
Starkiller is the king
That guy is trash
Abstrekt killing the last jungle member, even after death, truly a wonderful story
i want to destroy someone I'll join when there's one of this and just sweat
dude ize was basically roleplaying as Emperor Palpatine
The crazy thing about this game is that Tenz isnt playing. If you are a real VALORANT fan you would know Tenz is literally the best player of all time. He is a GOAT. He is my reason to wake up in the morning. No one can compare to the skill level of Tenz. This is pro play? No its not, because Tenz isnt here. Sentinel supremacy reigns in VALORANT.
that sponsor is too smooth i cant get mad
I liked Arctic but I was rooting for the desert biome so I’m glad they won please do more in the future
I liked the Arctic at first but knew there military power was low and desert was strong and not turning on each other
Put the aot season 4 part 2 opening music in the jungle vs arctic war!
i loved the arctick
I loved this but while I was watching this I think it would be much more wholesome if the desert and arctic teamed up and destroyed the jungle and made the Golden kingdom and then it was the Holy Age   Edit: Anyone else agree with me but you know the competitor of the new king I liked him too bad he was killed
Ize is such an ass ;-;
Why soup
This look like world box but 3d
The jungle was my favorite
Desert: Place for vacation Arctic: Place for Tourist to stay Jungle: Harsh place because bad king
desert was the most peaceful, maybe that's why lol, and also their strategies were amazing
The reason why Jungle lose. They listen to Ize. Bad strategy. They could have recruited or alliance with Arctic and use Arctic as a shield and then fight against Desert. Kudos to looking down on people tho.
Fck yeh keep subscribing on him these video was intense
The jungle Kingdom was the by far most strong and confident civilization and the commands by the king were absolutely strong and powerful and I love the fact that he is so confident about his work
i am form spain but i want to play that,its amazing
artic
I liked artick
"Best potato farmer... Me:OI TECHNOBLADE BETTER ...no i read that wrong, 2nd best..." YEAAA GO TECHNO
Imagine if we can reproduce lol
YOO CAN I PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT  VIDEO
i routed for jungle since the start
Make more type of thsi video pls. :)
Now WW2 featuring himler
I was going for the desert but I shady a lot of these type of civilization videos and they all had walls
Yea I new the jungle people would lose
I liked the jungle when starking was still in charge
8:59 fatherless meetup
i dont like jungle and artic, they arent loyal, full of lies man…
Y r u using genshin music as background music ?
The squid kid roast tho
THIS IS HELLA CONTENT
i need more
Ur voice is so funny like, you say tools like ToUlS
17:22 he sounds like a scientist that was proud of a work he did but didn't know how he did it
Awww man I liked jungle
This is Ukraine, Russia and America Minecraft
I love how silver called squid kid the first, no second potato farmer
Bro the ize guy are so annoying, just like a karen lol
Jungle
I LoVeD the desert civilisation, their perseverance and unwillingness to back down ensured them a swift victory. I also hated the Jungle king, I also disliked all the jungle players for following him in the end.
I very much loved n enjoyed the arctic energy m how they fell had me on the edge of my seats! I’d very much like to see more!
saw this while russia vs ukraine
We need part 2
I like the artic
oof squid kid got roasted 2:26
damn jungle should have just sat in their town eating carrots
When the next civilation video came out i really enjoy this video
Man it's like a ACTION MOVIE
Ice kingdom had the best kingdom no doubt dessert was last and jungle 2nd you guys suck at picking what the better town
I hoped starkiller would have become the leader and they would have won
nobody like genshin impact that game is for simp
The artic civilisation had the the best builds
That one desert husk is more loyal to his clan than some player are to their's
Not going to lie Ize dying was satisfying
That zombie is a legend
Honestly the only reason the jungle reason lost was because their bad king he literally had no leadership he was about to kill the other remembers just because they didn’t want to do what he wanted player are extremely important in stuff like this
Famous last words “have you ever heard of genshin impact”
Saw star killer and rooted for jungle... Then Ize killed him. Then i rooted for desert
35:53 gosh
The storyline is insanely cool all hale the desert empire
Artic is the best decorative village
4:58 We not gonna talk about how that guy sacrificed himself to save the other guy?
That zombie was clutch totally worth the time and effort on putting him there
I only focus the Genshin impact sponsor and also the background music
Bro the ice town was the best man jungle was the worst
The jungle would be nice but you know
I likely more to the jungle the leader is like a chaos man and have kinda good strategy
Rooted for jungle at first until that disgusting pig took control
The houses look like the entry into Valentine in red dead redemption 2
Damn it literally felt like attack on titan it was so fun to watch silver you nailed it 💯
I really like the Ice Civilization bcuz they really get along but they kinda need some work when it comes to Resources and All but I like their Civilization :)
Eyes has to be the jungle king
Jungle is like the Nazis
9:09 that one guy who’s late to the party lol
The best potato farmer Wait read that wrong Second best potato farmer
#adorablehome
Make more videos with civilization
I liked very much the jungle civilazation
i liked the jungle when star was there then i liked the desert
Do more of these videos pls
we need more like this
It’s good to see my old favorite hypixel uhc and skyblock creator pop up in my recommended! Happy you’re doing well
cabbage
why is saitama there😳😳
i think desert or artic
I absolutely loved the fact the zombie joined the fight against the Jungle king
28:00 what was that song?
gayshit impact :D
Ize is an example of a narcissistic, illogical, clownery human being.
Ize is so funny and makes for great content
Do it again but a flour team a jungle team a Acacia team a desert and much more or do another  great jot though 😀😀😀😀
At least i know that Jungle is my least favourite because if that happens to me that would be uncool
SECOND BEST POTATO FARMER I CANT BELIEVE HOW HARD THAT MADE ME LAUGH CAUSE ITS TRUE POTATO POTATO POTATO
“oh the lag oh the lag” i didn’t see no lag i just see and excuse of how bad she is 🤨
Bro the jungle king is so dramatic🤨
That's really a great video.I like this video.Nice Job Silver.
you should do more of this this is sooooo good
JUNGLE RULES !!!!
JUNGLE ARMY FOR THE WIN     but sadly they died :(
Ize may have been interesting, but he didn't need to act like that much of an ass to Star. This series aint real, but i'm pretty sure some of the players were having fun, and you can be a millitaristic dictator in minecraft without acting like that much of an ass tbh
i just love how the amngus statue just died xD
LOL THE TUNDRA POEPLE IS THIS WHAT CONTENT IS FOR U THREE INNCOCENT LIVES RIP
Jungle was the best
Na na. Bruh. We want revenge. Sequel!!!
The squid kid part caught me off guard
Man this is like rise of kingdoms man
9:04 be so scripted he didnt even finish his sentence ppl started jumping, if it was real he himself would sneaked
More of this plzz it was soo amazing
the jungle king is a massive cringer breaking the fun for 30 people because of his ego, don't pick him again
this is like dream smp, but maybe better
this is the first video I have watched its the best I have ever seen!
Not sure what would be better,  a sequel with entirely different players, or one that had people like Starkiller, Ize and Suep. I know Ize is getting some flak in the comments, but he was the most entertaining part of the video. I feel it wouldn't have been as fun without some drama.
jungle
i hate ize
Jungle kingdom wouldve won if they trusted ize from the start
Atik are peaceful and funny
artic
Ice is my fav
Artic
Jungle of course because I love war and violence
That one guy during the jungle election fighting the full diamond guy. As soon as Star said „Good Point“ he instantly folded along with Star
ize’s rule is quite similar to that of the real world country North Korea and most dictatorships in history, and it’s quite incredible and sad at the same time that just one person could overthrow an entire government, even in minecraft
Part 2 n0w
Techno blade is the best farmer
Don’t like the full diamond guy in the start of the video, seemed really self-centred
We all know the guy that brought back the zombie is the true MVP!
I liked artic They were chill
Panda
Squid kid is back boiiiiiii
Jungle's Leader was amazin'.
I really liked how they killed the traitor from the jungle when he tried to join artic, if he betrays his people imagine what he would do to the ones who aren't his xD
I like the Arctic kingdom
2:53 NOO NOOOOOOOO PLEASE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ngl Starkiller would've been better for the Jungle if he utilized Ize's resourcefuness. He was done so dirty
2nd best potato farmer    "EMOTIONAL DAMAGE"....
bruh the jungle begging before getting killed was satisfying af lol
Desert Kingdom knew they gonna win since the beginning
Lmfaooo the starfire slander was too funny
YOUR CONTENT IS INSANE keep it Up bro
Do this but with modern stuff
I was rooting for jungle kingdom. ☹️
I liked the Arctic the most but hated the guy who was a traitor
PLS MAKE THIS MORE OF THE KIND OF VIDEOS . GOOD JOB SLIVER
I wanna see a sequel to this
My rating for this is 10 stars since your voice is good story is like very convincing
I liked the Arctic and i hated jungle and decent on desert, I liked Arctic its because they had christmas spirit, i hate jungle because of them killing Arctic, im decent at desert because they were just doung there own things
Jungle kingdom was best
0:08 @XNestorio?!
no 1 potato farmer is always technoblade
please sequel it was so good
The jungle king legit made his civilization lose 💀 he was ready to go to war, barely anyone else was, he only wanted to go to war cuz he had better gear and didn’t take into accountability his civilization’s gear, got stomped and what he deserved, selfish ape
AWESOME
Yes
My name Silver
That Ize guy was a real Chad, the other one was just the type of guy who tells you whatever you want to hear, the sign of a spineless leader
that abstrekt zombie guy coming in suddenly for some reason gives me Dani's Youtube Battle Royale's ending
Imiss playing genshin but the storage, and this server was unstapable
Izy was so fucking stupid , he never had a strat and never thought what if the other civilizations were more advanced
Lets Take A Moment To Say The REAL Main Character Here Was The Dead Player Husk A.I
Жалко что нет русских субтитров
Bruh simp Sponserd
That was so cool
2nd best potato farmer ouch
T
Ngl but is a bit weird that you can join diffrent nation then is only should be 3 nation and you kill eny from a diffrent nation
Arctic people were my favourite ,very likable and entertaining
I’m not proud of how many ads were on this vid the total count of ads fr me the total ad count was 23
Jungle's last words:  Have you ever heard of Genshin Impact?
Lol "the best potato farmer wait i read that wrong the second best potato farmer" Cracked me up
Jungle would have won if they weren't so conflicted
I was for jungle
*My views on this video!*  *ARCTIC:* I’m honesty sad the arctic got taken down, I just loved how they didn’t care much about fighting, they had high spirits, and unlike the other kingdoms, didn’t really have anyone I thought were obnoxious or annoying! I lived have they had the ice rink and the tree! (Though I have mixed feelings about among us •o•) Though the building wasn’t great sometimes, it was fun to watch and just a nice kingdom overall. 8.5/10  *JUNGLE:* In the start, I thought this kingdom would be amazing and was very cool. But then, the 1st signs of a toxic community in the kingdom arose. I didn’t like the people who killed the cow and took the temple loot in the great hunger, but liked them later on. I thought star killer was great as he had actual good reasons to be king, and I was very sad when he got killed. There’s too much really to talk here, so I’ll just sum it up. I honestly kinda hated this kingdom, it was nice in the start, but slowly just… deteriorated. To me, they were just a kingdom with the thought of “kill or be killed”. They fought over king a ton, barely ever agreed with each other until being forced to at some point, and half of them, especially the tautness at that one part, were just heavily obnoxious. 2/10, was good in the start, was stupid in the end.  *Reminder: this is MY opinion, feel free to express your opinions in the replies! :)*  *DESERT:* I liked this kingdom, wasn’t the best, wasn’t the worst. They had pretty high spirits, were working hard, and had a good mix of seriousness and silliness! The way they paired up with the arctic survivors also made me like them more because I loved how they worked together in the war. I also loved how they had the zombie and just quickly decided on their king. Don’t have much to say about this one, I’d give it a 8/10 overall.  (I loved typing this for some reason idk why)
The jungle king is an idiot
snow kingdom forever!!!!
i feel like starkiller should've been "king", while ise was the general and go the actual king buffs. they wouldve been much more united and I think it wouldve gone smoother
ize got everyone killed because the raid instead of getting the people in iron enchanted diamond
GG
Would want to be on the desert team but my god the jungle team would be hella fun
Ever heard of jerkmate
Add guns tanks and aircraft
The jungle king has best strategy but they actually need all his teammates to be strong
And I think you should be a part of a civilization
Please please
Sequel but with more civilizations
i love the arctic, the town center was so nice and everyone was just enjoying while the other civilizations were sweating lmao
Part 2 pls
Imagine getting smacked to death by a mummy Xb
Bro why sponsor genshin impact u know thers kid watches ur vids and that game is simp
i liked jungle civilization
I liked the desert civilization, because they accepted the arctic, making new allies. Also, I feel like the king of the jungle was evil... Probably because he led the entire jungle nation to die. :/
Need another one pronto!!!
Junhpe
Do lots more please
Arctic is best civ
O
You know, you can hear BGM at 5:52 in Genshin Impact, I love that song, so if you're interested, I suggest you download the game, it's free! why not?
I really liked the jungle team
Star killer would have done better I ain’t gone cap he keeps his team to death after a victory
I wonder if anyone will every make a video where it'll be won with agreements rather than brutal violence
Bro, I wanted Jungle to win.
Honestly I thought the jungle village would be ruled with tyranny but ig u can't control menials and Gen Z with those measly threats XD
Abstrekt is basically the MVP, above all,
Bruhh artic was epic
I'm extremely happy that ize lost he was extremely cocky only because he had good items but it turns out just because you're cocky and you have enchantments doesn't mean who rule the world which I'm glad that happened
Dessert
Jungle king is strong tho
This was literally like a movie. Tyrant king, corrupt group who killed the competition, refugees seeking shelter, plot twists and backstabs, side story of a man bringing back his injured friend to live a happy rest of his life, and a very happy ending where they overthrew the corrupt single minded tyrant. This was beautiful.
2 kings
Morale of the story : DONT GET SO COCKY BOII
To be fair... Ize did have the right idea in my opinion. He had the right idea it just didn't work out, the invasion of the Arctic civ could've been cleaner, and his army should've concentrated on 2v1 battles, but those are quite difficult to set up in a chaotic all out war. As they said Starking was a nice guy, but it was a good thing for his nation that he died, pacifism simply wasn't the answer.
No joke, coolest Minecraft video I've ever seen
Kinda like how the desert is the most hopeless civilization in the beginning. But still ended up winning
Ngl Arctic had by far the best town, how the hell did they get last place
I just started And what the fuck 0:10
Silver can I please join I always wanted to join one of your challenges
Mighty Jungle myrmidons, you won’t be forgotten.
Can u do another Wars?
9:08 "oh genshin impact hell yeah baby" for some reason that make me laugh lol
your head saved people
You should make more videos like this Ngl it's so good
I was about to stop watching but squid kid’s “ guys don’t listen, he’s just got an accent “ made me laugh pretty hard so I stuck around
LONG LIVE THE TUNDRA
Genshin Impact!!!
Wait is that genshin impact background battle music
It's so fun to watch
The best minecraft civilization I've watched 💖  The human nature's betrayal and ugliness was displayed quite clearly in every way
dude Ize was making my blood boil this whole video lmao
i liked the desert kingdom they were teaming up properly and gathering resources so fast and teamwork i knew desert would win this lol. the jungle king was a total jerk !
My favorite was the jungle
my fav was abstrekt. He literally risked his life for his team and he had gold armor no helm bro. he too good as zombie.better than dream
Jungle should’ve won but they had a few bad decisions. They should have attempted to make arctic people join their army, and should have killed the first leader much earlier than they did.
19:30
would love to participate in an event like this! definently looking forward to the next event
"on the planet earth"
part 2 please
My favorate civilization is the desert i had hope in them
Ize has more power but he dint use his brain s
do another buts with 4 or 5 civilations and more classes
wtffff this IS THE BEST VIDEO OMG WHAT this is gonna blow up even more
Don’t like the jungle king
Jungle just being a civil war
Uh
Loved it
your subs are 1M its a bit good subs but what do you mean you have 9M?
Kinda sounds like anime story 😂
At the start the ice nation was my favorite but theye fell off.
If Ize worked together with Starkiller, I have no doubt Jungle would have won.
I was rounting for jungle i didnt like desert
With starrcowl(IDK the right spelling) the jungle would have won, but that treacherous, ruthless and pathetic Ize assassinated. He is a literal tyrant mad a hearing star's name also and forcing others to join his
i liked the artic kingdom for many sussy reasons :>
Loved this video, I love videos that includes player interactions
Next simulate Civilization 2 Pls
Man no more skyblock.  😪
Love the Mario music
I liked 🌵
Một bài hát rất hoài niệm , nhớ những ngày bồng bột của tuổi trẻ, chút kỷ niệm của tình yêu, lời chia tay vội vàng đúng như cái bồng bột ấy. Đức Phúc cover lại bài hát này tâm trạng quá !
dude really playin genshin's bgm while narrating. deadass had me stop mid vid to do dailies lmfao
if you see the joined the game its says many youtubers including 1 dream smp tecnhoblade
Desert for me
A 40 minute video that can keep me entertained. Very cool!
Magicgum copycat
There is a fine line between ignorance and confidence and the Jungle King passed that line a long time ago. o7
Welcome to the minecraft community this is what it become
This dude literally encouraged online racism in that one video that literally has a Racism in its title
17:49 hmmm looks kinda suspicious
yo it's Ize the narcissist
ah yes the jungle warriors using a blitzkrieg strategy to win the war was so cool :D
imagine if techno was in this one
Wait this is speed silver lmao
spped silver  pls plsy skyblockkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!
Auto sub;)
Wow I though jungle would’ve won
I like winter civilization the best
Feel bad for the artic army bro
"jungle king" got assasinated and made everyone lose if I became the king I say focus on the mine and fortifying the base to win
We need more of ice he was cool
Jungle 😢
oh my god that’s illegal the world is a C I R C L E?!?!!
feels good to know jungle lost
I like the article civilization
Tyranny of the jungle kingdom
YouTube really wanted me to watch this,This is all over my FYP.
Desert
And you killed none of them? Gosh
Once I get a PC, I wanna be in this and become king. Then lead my army into battle on horse back
I would want to see more of this!!
This video is cool! i want more
Gowgow
"2nd best potato farmer" Ruthless
I don't understand why everyone hates ize he got really far for what he had.
Jungle could've won but star died
It’s not fun without war
I liked desert cause Ize was very harsh and quite a dictator. The Arctic was NOT prepared for the invasion from Ize, and the Desert was pretty geared and took down the jungle. There also wasn't that much harsh politics in the Desert.
goes to show it never ends well with a tyrant as a leader although a sweet talker wouldn't necessarily be better but it would have let them lived longer
the zombie warrior saved the day
Jungle had the worst leader lol who hell just goes to kill somone and ruins the ambush to save his pride
That roast though
If you did not tell them theres other region it will be challenging for them and shocking
I ENJOYED THIS SM PLEASE MAKE MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS! This is my 5th time watching this :D (take your time though <33) I'm a fan of Genshin Impact!! My favourite character is Xiao :))
The randomness of the zombie ally was hilarious
Glad to see squid kid again, he still has gotten very successful with his channel with the help of technoblade with the potato war
More videos like this please
Ize was the only one in this simulation with a head on his shoulders. He was resourceful enough to attain leadership and assertive enough to demand respect. What the desert needed was a leader with direction, and as much as star was appreciated he didn't have the same conviction as ize. The plan to strike as the blood moon was ending was a tactical risk yes, but it was far from thoughtless. He managed to catch the enemy at a point they weren't ready to defend. The only reason casualties were suffered was due to half the group remaining behind, and ize even recognized that fault and fixed it! And the actual raid was so successful! He managed to eliminate 16 of their people without losing a single one during the active skirmish. And as a plus the desert kingdom thought it was a Civil War! After this point is when ize started getting cocky and stupid. He should have realized the plethora of tactical disadvantages he had since the enemy had greater numbers, resources, and preparation time. I would have opted for guerrilla tactics employing the usage of tnt against the desert to diminish their resource advantage. Instead ize made many fatal mistakes that cost him the war. Like seriously charging straight at the enemy through their territory after you've successfully won another biome! All in all his strategy was great until the dopamine and adrenaline got to his head and made him lose all brain function.
How do i get into these simulations???
3:55
Genshin impact is fpr cringe people I dislike genshin impact
Im glad to see a genshin sponsor..
Lets get sikver ti 5Mil subs
Honestly as much as we can joke about this,imagine what the jungle king would have done had they been given power irl
battle genshin music
Man that’s sad I really had hope that that jungle king would be successful (the second one) not third or first
To the person who is reading this will become successful and stay safe
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH NO ONE CAN DO LIKE THIS
I hope i can be included next video.
You just made a MCD chest
2:21 the burn, you actually killed him
Civilization is best please make 1 more part but there civilization will be end , neather and overworld
i liked the arctic
I liked the jungle civilisation more
i love this
I hated jungle my fav was arctic it was sad...
Desert kingdom: must be better than all work work work   jungle kingdom: must get enchantment and have an heir to The throne  Arctic kingdom: PARTY
ALERT ALERT! UPCOMING NEW UPDATE *Dolphin Luagh*NEW WOOD TYPE MANGROVE WOODS SWAMP HASBEEN UPDATED 1.19 IS COMING*DOLPHIN LUAGH* NEW UPDATE"TheWildUpdate"*Dolphin Luagh*
great vid man u earned my sub
You are bad
1 I liked deserts build best   2 i though artic would win 3 i never liked jungle
I like how he called squid kid the second best
jungle trash desert best
Bro you Joined 2 years ago and you have more subs than a lot of people that have been doing this for 5 years+ 👍
Jungles leader was the best ong
famous last words: "You've ever heard about Genshin Impact"  -Jack TBC-
I did not like Ize. He was just a snake and a warmongerer.
My favourite is still the Arctic, sadly they lost. They have very high spirits and is the ideal civilisation I long for.
Desert is my favourite
What Ize did to the people during the ambush was genuinely evil he threatened their lives if they didn't comply not only that but they murdered star killer a kind and innocent man just because he was on the opposite party for a while
rise of kingdoms be like:
Let's go desert team
This is amazing! Everything is framed in a dramatic way that makes the story really come together, and the music was just icing on the cake!
So the jungle civilization probably has the best biome but not a very trusting community
I like the jungle civilization
I'm rooting for Arctic.  Edit: Eyes is a piece of shit Another Edit: Good work Desart.
Desert
11:39 😘
This is just hermitcraft but extreme and public
Honestly the jungle deserved the dub Or at least the arctic
I’m mad about the jungle king he sucked
Throughout the video you’ve been using genshin impact music I like it
I would love to see a part two and have like new civilizations or add more to the desert article and the jungle like mabye a swamp or a a plains
5:00 my guy saved 2 people at the cost of his own, he earned my respect
It is the best video it is epic pls make another one
//sorry y'all, spoilers, didn't think so many people would read this! I was originally rooting for the Artic, but the survivors didn't remain loyal to the Desert, who took them in as refugees, so I was glad the Desert won in the end! And I love that abstrekt, someone who died in the beginning, was able to save their nation even in the afterlife! And I'm glad Ize got their karma in the end. Very entertaining video!
I’m sad now I wanted juggle to win
2:26 lol you just roasted my man
I liked the jungle civilization
desert kingdom
Im like jungle
quantity > quality
Jungle king really pulled a Napoleon Bonaparte 💀
30:22
desert is the best
I wanted jungle to win... GG Desert
The background music are so beautiful
People that make the adds a part of the video are so epic
Imagine if there's a fourth civilization consisting only of the best redstone engineers and builders. Zero combat experience, just redstone and good understanding of the game.
Wait squid kid is here?
I love this.
Subscribe evrewan so he can make more
Jungle all the way
We need peach
23:15 the back flip haha
never put ize in these vids again. added content but made it less enjoyable tbh
GUYS I INSTALLED GENSHIN IMPACT AND I HAVENT SEEN MY DAD IN THREE DAYS HELP
Jungle would have won if they had stopped to resupply and strategize an attack on desert after invading Artic.
who realised that the genshin background music was used through out the video?
fuck desert nation, all my homies hate desert nation    -This post was made by Jungle Gang
Are the civilization supported by all versions? Or just one.
i like the arctic nation
OMG THE LEGEND IM A SQUID KID IN THE POTATO WAR
make a civilization that keeps going like a series, see how it goes.
Silver you can make more civilization video because they're pretty interesting
Alternate Title: Invading russia but its winter
The dessert is my favorite the jungle the least because they are chaos
I was really rooting for the jungle kingdom. I thought that Starkiller would've made a great leader. But after his assassination, I felt like they were definitely going to die. And as Ize started getting angrier and angrier, I felt that he was going to die. Too bad they lost, but a I think a sequel would be interesting.
Aww man jungle lost :(
Hypixel uhc:(
I need a game mode like this
Very nice! If this series continues, this series will be better then MaginGum's.
I was actually rooting for jungle and arctic. Darn it.
I'm honestly surprised that the people who didn't join Ize didn't just kill him when he came back to the jungle village, considering they outnumbered him by like 8 players. Honestly, Ize was a good player, but he only got this far because he got super lucky with his diamonds, because if just had iron no one would have given a shit about him.
artic got robbed
Hey I'm an og supporter since vid one and it's nice to see you growing!
Part two
"caught off guard by a creeper" literally a phantom
That jungle leader is my least favorite person oh "I have armor" the other candidate would have been much better I mean who knows! The only reason he was sitting around was because it wasn't war time yet.  But this vid was still super cool 😎 good job with making it.
THE SNOW KINGDOM NOOOO
i like artict
I definitely liked the desert kingdom the most, I really couldn’t stand the jungle king man, I liked that kingdom the most before he was crowned and they killed starkiller
Can you please make more of these content? I loved this video
"The Blood Moon rises once again" Also, I appreciate you putting Earthbound music in the background for some segments!
Honestly the jungle king had to face all odds its pretty impressive he got theyre
i want sequal
snow town was better
I love civilization videos.
Epic
Ize was such an abrasive twat, that’s why no one wanted to support him, he was toxic, bossy, and shirked responsibility whereas star garnered support by being kind
do this again just with 3 moles in each civilization
eyes never dizerved the thrown he never even diserved to be in that nation
Moreeeeeeeweeeee
Wow this is amazing video
Ize is just Jack from Lord of the Flies
nice video. hope there is another one
Jungle
Snow and desetr
when i was watching the part when that guy says "it actually features a real grass block" my wifi went out and it did the loading thingy... which was basically what my mind was thinking
The jungle guy with full Diamond was mad annoying
This would be fun to do... Can i try?. I play ob bedrock
The squid kid joke made me laugh 😂
this was dumb because its a three for all, jungle was way better and desert just sat there and lucked out.
Jungle
Yoooooo you got squid kid yeaaaaa
I like the artic they are cute
I'm routing for The Desert people
GENSHIN?
I liked jungle but they lose is sad
i was rooting for jungle
Starkiller is the true king
Desert nation
I would follow u but I don't have a computer for mc java and I don't have the money to buy mc java
DO MORE PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Bro PLEASE do another one I wanna do this so bad you did a great job making this I love how well it’s planned out!
Star was a good man he is true king
Bro the winter nation is the best my guy
Jungle: attack Abstrekt zombie: FOR THE KINGDOM!!!
im being honest, ize was smart, the jungle people were weak.
Respect for the zombie
LOVE the Mario music
Ize is such a bad leader
Artic: fun Desert: good friends everywhere Jungle: TRYHARD
i really hate that you did artic dirty :(
For some of you there may be peace or perhaps war. Although for one of you
Star would have made jungle survive longer
Make part 2 we will give you 2m likes
Their was one flaw in jungles plan it was that artic could join enemies therefore making their plan of killing everything not good and it would have been better to actually start a war between two different civilization and then take the refugees this would then mean you would have a major advantage
100 players, 3 sides, where does the extra one go if it's 33 on each side
LMAO 3 people for the content
I'd rank the building competition the complete opposite of what you guys did lol
Ize was the mvp. Funny lad all around, great tyrant and dictator, would vote for him
jungle
Artic is def my fav cus they chill but the jungle too ruthless
I wanna see if you like to have a part two that will be amazing💕
The background music is the Mondstadt battle theme from Genshin Impact
Bro what is this ROK?
animation skills are too fucking good
The fact that dessert kingdom was cheating cuz the zombie didnt get damage even tho the jungle player was swing at it
Feel bad for the arctic they had the best good looking civilization
I can't believe the actual squid kid is in the video!
It was like watching Rome rise and fall
Sad the desert didn't crown the zombie king.
Mongolian empire - taught from minecraft
Squid Kid's reputation has been ruined by the Great Potato Wars
damn this is movie worthy content  The guy who brought his zombie teammate back to town is a goat
at first it was a tie between all but once ize got to be king i wanted artic or desert to win after artic got invaded i wanted them to win but i do like desert too and i liked them fine CONGRATS DESERT!!!!
Felt bad for star.
Jungle ofc
bro if only this were a social studies project 💀
Seqeul
You copied magicgums thumbnail
This should has where the king can request player to join their civilization then they can accept it
The jungle tribe was the most interesting of all of them
Jungle team know wassup hell mc players even play genshin  But the dessert people are smart af
Artic civilization 100%
i liked artic but oml star was corny as fuck but he was actually nice aize or whatever his name is was so mean i would've betrayed him so fast
It made me sad that they killed starkiller
MAKE A SEQUEL OR I WILL UNSUBSCRIBE
Fuck Desert kingdom!
Star killer is way to similar to evil morty
Sword Art Online
if only I had 100 friends or people to play with, very good vid either way E// it was very sad the Starkiller guy was being all nice to them, while they plan his assasination
desert lets go!
The zombie was a cool plot twist
Can xbox players join @silver
desert kingdom
Full diamond guy also has a wack accent.
YOOO I LOVE THIS MAKE MORE!!
Def rooted for the jungle village
This is entataining ty
Desert and artic
Zombieeeeeeee!!!
Love your videos silver  wish i could join on android
Strongly sounding British boys saying walflin in first sand civilization being chill men, and using sacrifice in second. Gay men and souly women in 3rd place hast to be the funniest thing I’ve ever seen what a democracy.
Zombieeeeeeeee
I LOVED this Next time try: Birch Forest, Meadows, Large Cave
I laughed out loud when he said “wait, I read that wrong SECOND best potato farmer”  He’ll never live it down Technoblade never dies
yes sequel
Even in death abstrekt was loyal to the desert. A truly great member.
The video was amazing but the fact it got sponsored by genshin impact is just awful
damn brovey ize died
nice video,keep up with the good work,just didnt like ize,constantly being aggresive even after he won the election,also him leaving during the bloodmoon was stupid as the mobs were strong
I really liked jungle kingdom but my favorite was the desert also I just subscribed
I miss this program QwQ
I was rooting for the ice nation, desert 2nd, and jungle last cause I liked starkid
I got really into the story and how these players act, I was really rooting for the artic
Oh wait isn’t squid kid from potato war?
part 2?
Nice earthbound music
Why does ize sound like jacksepticeye lol
Haven’t watched the whole vid yet but I’m going to root for desert  Edit: let’s goooooooo babyyyyyyy
Aaaayyyy!!! We got in a squid kid! Potato war! Love how you corrected it to 2nd
I am very sad of stars deaf but eyes was pretty toxic
I definetly like the jungle the best
There is a lesson here to learn if you declare war for no reason you will fall and lose.

The genshin background music matches
Poor squidkid hes getting bullied
jungle should have won they made all the right choices and artic got lucky and i hope everyone in the artic dies
The artic kingdom is so cuteee
He quits skyblock for a year, I go to his main channel and don't see much, and then I see millions and millions of views on this channel, just wow. amazing job!
The genshin impact yeah baby got me
Genshin simpact 3:20
Desert was my favorite
This so well made!
Great video keep it up
I stopped watching because Ize became king
The jungle kingdom honestly should have won
i was routing for the jungle until that one guy became king so i wanted anyone but him to win
o7
desert nation seemed fun
Clash of clans
Your so mean to the artic
I was rooting for the jungle team
Good Nintendo music.
This was amazing! We all need a sequel.
I've watched most of these civilization videos and this is the best one yet.
Ngl I thought arctic would win )-:
Ize was driving me insane god I hate him lmao
I think you should make this video again but your videos are really long so please make shorter videos it would mean a lot
SLIVER I WAS YOUR 5K SUB
I wanted artic to win:(
Not to be rude but did you take inspiration from magic gum
what do you mean you made them? what was keeping them????

Great video but id love to see 4 teams because I feel like if 2 teams fight and 1 team waits to fight the winner the 3rd team has an advantage
Love the mario theme song In the desert
Tree leader was terrible
I am glad forest lost
no
i liked the jungel most
Im sad that Arctic lost tho they seemed so nice with their snowball fights and ice rink. Its a shame that most of them were picked off
Arctic
I love your videos you are my faviorite youtuber,wish i would of joined
None of jungle’s wars would have happened if silver hadn’t granted them first place
i kinda liked the brute way of jungle great video
The great potato War part 4: TAKING OVER A CIVILIZATION by technoblade
14:51 the among us though I like that arctic did among us but the desert was organized and didn't try to pick any fights
Y think i dont play genshin?
Squid kid is gonna be so cheesed
https://youtu.be/tlUVGfFFeBI
I really love how all of this was 100% not planned out and happened naturally and overall everyone loved this.   Silver, we need more content like this seriously
Squid_Kid and Private F  trying to co-exist with mere mortals
14:49 who is making among us lol
HOW WAS JUNGLE FIRST PLACE??
Oof. Squid will forever be the #2 best potato farmer.
Disappointed star should pf been kind for leadership the other was just stronger but his ways wont bind others nor have peace hes just to bossy and evil star is who they needed
Only legends know what he meant when he said “I mean 2nd bestpotato farmer”
2:21 killed me😂😂
i just started opening genshin impact and the sponser pops up
genshin impact is for weebs no way im downloading it >:(
fucked up and evil stuff i. this video. hope youre able to change for the better
Game of thrones in minecraft
Jungle all the way
heck yea man!! id love to see another one
desert fr i knew they gonna win i love deserts so ez dubbb
Bro my guy literally made the mines Moria I love it
GENSHIN IMPACT! WOOOO!!!!
once i saw that dessert built a pyramid i was cheering for them
Ize is really annoying
I WANTED THE ARTIC TO WIN
i wish the jungle wqas blown up i hate them fer killing squid kid
This is like rise of kingdoms
Did not even gove credit to trixyblox for making the map
i liked the bloodthirsty jungle plple
SAD i lo e jungle
I love conflict in Minecraft Civilization  you should do more of these videos but with 200 player civilization  I subbed
I’d like to really see an addition in which before I player dies for good they get to give a few last words. It would allow for some better story lol.
Technoblade would be proud
Ize was the worst leader. He kinda reminded me of ulfric stormcloak but without his charisma or smarts. He was like hitler or gengis kahn.
how can i play in your server? also i really enjoyed this video, definitely subbing.
*snickers* I love democracy 25:18
Ive been playing Genshin Impact for 5 hours straight and when i finally decide to take a break the music still hunts me
holy fuck, i really hate people like that guy who killed the stardude....... i even wrote that commentary
Ize suck
This is such a fun video! If I had more friends I'd want to try this myself lol  The snow kingdom was very wholesome I'd want to live there.
Already posted this on another video, but may as well spread my idea til someone gives it a shot: Interdimensional war.  Essentially, the three civilizations are residents of the overworld, nether, and end respectively, each with their own unique advantages and disadvantages as well as custom made maps to ensure they all had a fair chance at developing. After some time has passed, portals between dimensions would open up at undisclosed points on each map, and the civilizations would be allowed to cross over. Peace? War? It's all up to them to decide whether to align with their neighbors or become conquerors of worlds. As a bonus, perhaps their could be custom made, dimension specific bosses and mobs that come during specific events, making it not just a game of conquest, but survival.
I used to play Genshin Impact, but I can still feel when the soundtrack music is playing. I think I heard the battle theme playing
mkjhbj
Please make a a murderer in Minecraft
Omg its amazing…
cant they just u know reproduce
I was rooting for Arctic :(
I liked the desert from the start
This cool
Rip Irish legend ize
In my opinion ize was so annoying and full of himself he thought he was better than everyone just because he had good gear
Haven't seen PrivateFearless in a long time! Cool to see his name is Ize now.
Squid
Ixtal, Freljord, and Shurima in minecraft
wow, I think star was a really good guy who just wanted peace but then ize came, then got assassinated. o7's
God damn you roasted squid kid
This video is amazing!
That was great, I wanna see more!
what s with the mario music?
“But what if they were split into different nations?”  Simple.they kill each other
So the lesson here is that stand your ground or jungle will wipe you out
These are the best, I would definitely enjoy a sequel!
If not for the dedication of transporting the desert zombie they would have lost😂
Do the overworld vs. the nether vs. the end
Desert kingdom is gay
My favorite was the Desert kingdom
whats the name of the sountrack 6:00 - 8:55
You copied magic gums thumbnail
i was routing for desert
Ize was a bit of a dictatorial moron if you look at it. The goal wasn’t to be the last nation standing, it was to survive a month. There was no need to attack the other nations, let alone the foolhardy risks he took to do so. He strongarmed the jungle into following him and lost a bunch of people to the blood moon when they easily could’ve waited till afterwards. Then when they attacked the desert they faltered at the slightest hint of rebuttal. That’s not even mentioning how the rankings for each nation had shown the desert was second to the jungle, so if he wanted to win an arms race the desert would’ve been a much more sensible target since they were further ahead than the snow people. It’s honestly impressive how awful he was as a leader
I wanna See more of this. I Love IT
Should do different forms of government. Monarchy, dictatorship, socialism, democracy etc.
ok now how tf did jungle win at building
MORE. NOW.
TECHNO IS NUMBER ONE!!!
Nobody killed the cow it despont
Love him or hate him, ize made this whole video exciting. I honestly respect him as a leader, yeah he was kinda an asshole but most politicians are. I love the story of Starkiller trying to be an energetic benevolent leader who was too soft for the harsh realities of the world and was inevitably assassinated. Ize was a great leader, he cared for his nation, boosted moral, called his men to arms, and lead a very successful military campaign.
My favorite character of this story was abstrekt.
Poor squid, you didn't have to do him like that.
I liked the arctic biome because of the skate rink.
The jungle
Will you do a bedrock edition video on things like these?
RIP Starkiller
As an ex-youtuber  I understand how much work went into making this, its insane! Also the cities should have mined more it would have been a smart idea
Lesss go desert
Here are jackTBCs last words  *”have you heard of genshin impact?”*
what an amazing project u deserve more bro :3
I was on the team of Deseret from the first 😳😳😳
I was hoping for jungle to win
Jungle by far
Artic da best
I liked the Arctic, simply because they had a lot of personality, and a really nice base
DEsert lucky that they wasnt first to get attack by junglle
i love the genshin music especially the liyue fighting one my personal fav😌
My snow kingdom!;-; the poor christmas tree
Love the video how can I join
The moment when you are to young to have Twitter …
SILVER SILVER SILVER next time u do this can u pls make it both Java and bedrock I would be SO happy to do this but I don’t have Java but it would be a dream come true if u could
i like the ice
tbh everytime i watch these the dessert always wins
can't believe i was cheering everyone except dessert... and then... spoiler alert
RIP star... :(
Bro its a perfect vidéo 10/10
Ize actually pissed me off, he's gonna be the one who kills us all one day.
That ize guy played way too risky
The jungle kingdom could have won if they did some easy steps first like getting everyone diamond gear then waiting till the blood moon was over and after killing the artic nation they could have scouted out the desert kingdom they could have taked out some desert people who were alone and they would think it was mobs then rush in with golden apples and 2 people with crowns winning
This is alot like a different video with the hunger event but im glad you took insporation from them!
It would be awesome to be in one of these but I don’t have Java or twitter
I remember you had 60k sub
why does everyone steal from magicgum?
Bruh jungle leader low key reminded me of a certain dictator for a bit there
isn't this magic gums thumbnail no hate but isn't this the exact same one magic gum use in his 100 player civilization.
Jungle had the best story out of all of them
R.I.P Alumio
Bro ize sounded so annoying
NOOOOOOOOOO SQUID KIDDDDD!!
Willam
I love these videos
In thé begening i really likes thé jungle but After starkiller was betrayed i literally hated them
seaquel
I was for Jungle until Star Killer was betrayed. Then, it was Desert. 🙂
The jungle king was a jerk and I ended up voting for desert to win
How to join
I don't play java D:<
The Zombie coming back to life is amazing
i was rooting for tyrannic Jungle.
I was artic all the way through
The jungle leader was kinda narcissistic, kinda wish star killer was the leader
hes honestly connor mcgregor
Desert Was By Far The Best!!
Props to silver for making timestamps so if we want to, we can skip the sponsor more easily
“Oh genshin impact oh hell yeah baby” lmaoooo
there not in hardcore
“The best potatoes farmer in Minecraft” “Oh wait sorry the 2nd best” Got me dying! 😂
rise of kingdom's ads be like:
IM A SQIUD KID YOUUUUU Are stoopid techno is better.
Jungle
I WANTED JUNGLE TO WIN THE WAR
Arctic was my favorite, I liked the vibe of their village :( Sad to see them die. I loved how festive and fun they were.
So fun to watch. I really liked the idea of civilization and war on a server.
The jungle king ruined everything! Kinda wished they just kept building their civilizations
I really enjoyed this video. I loved how united the arctic was, and the fact that a five-man army still managed to survive for the longest time against all odds was amazing  Desert probably had the least chaos in them, and they won. Which is amazing  I actually really enjoyed Starkiller and how he helped the jungle. If i'm being honest, Ize took risks and won because of luck. If the arctic would've been better geared, it could've easily went downhill very quickly  But still, what an amazing video, 40 minutes that felt like watching an epic fantasy trilogy, one of my favorite Minecraft videos in a while!
We want more of this
yo can I join the next Minecraft server??
i like that u put different mario music depending on which biome
Does anybody know what plugin, mod or whatever it is @silver use to get this crown that give you elytra and extra hearts ?
The last jungle guy would totally be me. We have like, similar personalities
i was voting for jungle
Okay, cool and all.. but this is literally a DIRECT COPY of MagicGum's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxZXCxixEOI , ranging from the thumbnail, content, and how the entire concept works.
I was rooting for dessert and I’m happy now
I’m playin genshin while watching dis vid
Im glad this became a trend. There's something different to each one everytime!
7:52 and I'm already a desert region fan!
JUNGLE shoud have won
Dang I wish the jungle won
i wish jungle won
Sequel Please!!!
Im playing geshin Impact alreddy zwo years
Can you do more of these I loved to watch how the civilisation built up and then thought
genshin impact is ASS
He said "My First" so there would be probably a "Second" one
Genshin impact? More like gey shit in fact  –medic team fortress 2
desert
Imagine technoblade was fighting the jungle team leader he would get wooped
whats a genshin impact (not like it blew up a year ago)
WDYM U KINDA ROOTED FOR JUNGLE???!!!
Anotherone pls
This was SICK!! VERY VERY WELL EXECUTED. I HOPE I CAN PLAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT IN THE LONG TERM. LIKE NOT JUST IN ONE SIT BUT WOULD GO ON FOR YEARS
Starkiller > ize  Ize is just a ruthless dictator who thinks hes superior because of not sharing rescourses in the beginning of the civilation and risking his community just because he thinks hes the best   Starkiller only wanted a democratic form of civilation that would spread the recourses over each other
the thumbnail is so similar to magicgum's ya copy.
HOW THE HECK ARE YOU THE SPEEDRUN YOUTUBER TO 1 MIL OMG WOW AMAZING
love this pls do more
I like the desert. i HATE the king of the jungle tho
Would love to join but here the event starts at 22:00(time when recording was) and im bad at english lol
25:08 rip Infernally 35k subs guy
THIS IS GREAT I NEED MORE PLEASE
Genshin impact more like gamble impact
I liked arctic the most :(
Bro u put insane amount of effort u deserve a sub ✓
What’s the server address form this video
Are you on Twitch
I wanna see an actual civil war happen in one of the kingdoms
i was so mad when they killed jungles king
This whole war is like the story of Napoleon capturing the whole of europe but losing against the russian because he was too greedy. This is excactly what happened to jungle´s leader.
Lesson : be cocky but not too cocky
Bro, did i just watch the rise and fall of jungle Hitler?
The best player in this video is abstrak the zombie
that was so so amazing, i felt like i was watching a movie !
This video took a TON of effort just thinking of the idea itself. I mean you had to go on youtube and have ish13c popup on your recommended, AND WATCH THE VIDEO??? Then you copied the video so hard man!!!
What a great video!! I have never played Minecraft and WATCHED the whole video, it was like a great movie with  courage, ambition, betrayal, divine intervention and a final kamikaze attack hahaha.      Ize what a true emperor and conqueror he was!!
I wasn’t rooting for anyone until ice came in charge of jungle that i was rooting for Arctic and desert than desert .
You are a legend... a good video,reminded me to do my schoolwork and very enjoyable
i love this PART 2 PLS
i guess Ize added to the content and tension, but damn, how did the cocky bastard get elected over the humble dude lmao
I like the arctic biome, but jungle felt like a game of thrones type shit 😭😭😭
I am rooting for 5aitama
love the genshin music u edited in
9:03 Genshin is fake Zelda
The jungle was the best ;)
Why Genshin dude why.......
Jungle was my fav
9:03 I fucking hate Gen-Z 🤦‍♂️ I’m so disappointed….
I loved how they tried to kill the desert king as soon as he was elected
You took inspiration from MagicGum, and you didn’t even make it copied and stuff. Good job!
this is almost a 1 to 1 recreation of ashes "States" video except theres classes even the first world event was the same as the island video ash made
go watch the original idea from ash
Everyone is out here hating on Ize, but imagine how much less interesting the video would've been without him...
WE NEEED SEQUEL
Great video man! I was feeling the jungle kingdom after their assault on the ice kingdom, but in the end I'm happy the desert people killed that assassinating asshole
Seup seems like the protagonist here
I wanted jungle to win
I can see every mistake that everyone made
Jungle couldve take the w  First after they raded artic they needed to get stronger gear and enchats and slowly take down desert but with a bad king they took the l
FUCK KAZUAHA RERUN
FUCK IM GONNA MISS THE SHOGUN BC MY PC BROKE AND MY PHONE CANT RUN GENSHIN
This video was great really great please do more of there
9:07 This guy doesn't like Genshin Impact     HE LOVES IT
4:42 ah yes "starved"
“Oh GEnsHiN ImpACt HeLL yeA bABy”
Jungle
a necromancy event could be cool if you brought heads to an area players could come back to life
I don't like starkiller
I give you 1000000
R.I.P abstrekt you will be missed for on and on :(
My guy techno is proud of you 2:20
How do I be in one of these
Dude this was beautiful. I liked the arctic civilization best.
Ize is the ultimate sigma male
Omg! This video is amazing! Most 100 player videos are boring or everyone just dies instantly. This has been thought out so cleverly and it paid off. I can't untill the next 100 players video.
Ize gear didnt mean anything in reality, just by them building a nice village they got food, place to stay and the prize for getting first was superior to what he had gathered up by not helping
Ahh yes Technoblode my favorite
11:38 mans op as frick
I had hope for the desert village, and they won
Me when it said 9.7million subs and 27 videos: 🤨🤣
While Abstract was dying, he remembered that dying is gay
4:42 sus
I liked desert
that's so frekn cool, this explains our real world
It was amazing watching Ize's arc throughout all this, turns out might doesn't make right after all, who woulda guessed!
Gimmie more o deez viedeos
you know this IZE guys is a piece of shit in real life but it was nice to have a villain character here
Jungle
artic could have won if they moved into the dwarven mountain as soon as they found it then they should have closed the door and mined and then they would have been isolated from everyone else and never would have lost a life then it would have been easy to kill the remaining desert players
Make a super lucky block one
The Arctic definitely won bruh
I would be the person who steals everthing.
That's a bit chilling, how a Ize got a lead in resources by undermining his tribe (the temple steal), plotted to eliminate the naturally emerged leader to grab the power, eventually got elected by basically threatening with civil war, and ended up leading his people to their deaths - half of them at the point of his sword, actually.  I mean, it may be a cool story when it happens in Minecraft, but it's chilling that similar shifts of power can happen and do happen in real world politics. Literally right now.
Why was Ize so irritating like I’m so annoyed just hearing him talk
damn bro squid got violated
i liked the artic the most
next time split them like that: pvp-ers, builders, parkourers...
I hate ize. He's so annoying, and he's got an Irish accent. He's arrogant, infuriating, rages, and is so annoying.
dude bringe ize back and also we need a next pary
Literally stole the thumbnail
I have genshin impact in 2021on September and got tartagliac1 dilucec0 kiqenqc0 and more amazing events stuff
I LOVED the desert And i was happy when they won
The arctic should’ve came first jungle last and  the desert in the middle
no wonder they were in the jungle. they were CRAZY!
The Genshin Music completed the vibe of the video man, their composer nails the music per each region and just nice to vibe off to.
Desert was my favortie
Subbed!
I'd rather pick jungle
Idk that makes me mad for some reason tho just them being able to fuse the artic with the desert but i guess it is war so
LES GOOO TECHNOOOO
lituarly efery youtuber that plays minecraft has done this  But ill still watch it
18:17 Since when did churches have advertisements?
Too bad Arctic didn't win. I thought Suep was gonna come back and in for his nation, well this was a really good vid!
I agree
Genshin impact has a moaning tier list it's disgusting
IM SO HAPPY JUNGLE DIDNT WIN i was rotting for artic but I also liked the desert one
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I was rooting for Starkiller, he was such a good leader, prioritising his people. I was rooting for the jungle kingdom until Ize was elected king. Ize pissed me off so much, dictating and taking stupid, unnecessary risks. So glad the desert kingdom won.
I love the Genshin OST in the background
Whehwehwuehwheh
Jungle nation deserved the win but they didint win xd
ice was the best
Won
I wish the jungle one
"𝗚𝗢𝗦𝗛"😂
Artic
the genshin soundtrack fits so well for some reason.
What Genshi inpact players need the most: *S H O W E R*
abstrakt lore when
I HATE GENSHIN ITS SO TRASH THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE PLAY IT IS BECAUSE OF THE ANIME WIFUS
I liked the d
the snow kingdom should have won that build battle they had the most beautiful town of them all
Please make more of these man, I trust people will come up with a lot more tactics then just rushing it and that would be a lot of fun to watch.
POTATO WAR REFERENCE WITH SQUID KID, appreciated my man
i was sub when he only had 6 subs
Y no mataron ni uno? GOSH   JAJAJJA
Even if the desert civilization had one of the worst starts they somehow managed to win
Please add a sequal
Genshin Impact players should probably stay away from games that have a lot of kids
Get abstraked
Well, it could all end different if Jungle nation stayed with eating carrots.
Ezi was prob the smartest one out of all of them he would have won if it wasn't dropping his sword
Honestly genshin impact f^ckin sucks
Hola.... I don't want to be toxic but I saw a ish13c's video like this too he was the first to make the civilization vids... But silv ur a op dude
Waarom Waarom heb je nooit te ver gegaan
I also play it and do you play it ?
11 een een
You know, it was preety sad. The jungle civilization could have been in peace with everyone, but starkiller got killed and everything went bad. The question is:  WHY THE F#UCK DID THEY CHOOSE THE MOST WHOLESOME, LUXUIRUS AND FUN CIVILIZATION TO DESTROY FIRST???!?!?!!!?!!
"for eternity players have gotten along"  since when!? XD
Pls. Are more
Desert Zombie part was the highlight
Genshin impact more like gay shitinfact
Was hoping the jungle would win
I love it make more please
Desert made an epic comeback
This is better than game of thrones
To be honest I wanted jungle to lose
We want more vids like this one
bro didin't even give credits to Magic Gum
that fucking felt like a movie, good job bro
I’ll would love to see more of these types of videos! Amazing love you channel
amazing video
i loved the comedy these groups had, made me laugh alot ngl hope to see more but either way great stuff! its a breath of fresh air
You rent squid kid
I love Genshin Impact too.. but My device isn't compatible with it...
I wonder if a undertale mod was created it would be very cool
Is this available for mobile too?
super mario bros  music
:( my jungle team died
Pog
Silver your the worst
At least credit magic gum
The fact that the zombie that that guy spend minutes to bring back did damage to help his kingdom is such a masterpiece
I wish I could punch ize in the face.
tbh this is better than dreamsmp
I REMEMBER when he had 300k subs
Why sponsor this makes this video much wose
Izzy has been my favorite king out of all these series
Sadly, here was no Vietnam War parody :(
No offence but I think "Ish" wassthe one who originally made the Idea bc of it pls credit them
Omg this was so cool this was my favorite video you have ever made keep it up and pls make a sequel
Awesome!
The add made me click away loool
Make your own thumbnail next time
jungle
this is just a state knock off
Minecrafdt
why is ize so evil
I hated the jungle nation after Star died
https://youtu.be/BvqfafB6Pn0  Wtf
Ize should've distributed everything and they would have won. What a greedy man.
"am i king?" yeah
I was really rooting for suep in this one, it was really cool seeing him try his best to survive and save the Arctic nation despite the odds.
Nice Cid, but the Blood Moon is totally not inspired by Terraria XD
ize was basicalky kim jong un
if this was me i would just make my own little hidden house with obsidian and just ride it out
My favorite Civilization was 50% Arctict and 50% Desert
I liked artic until they betrayed desert so my favrite is desert
I like how you used genshin impact music when the border expanded
I love the snow :( they loss sad
No
28:02 I knew they'd recruit people
the leader of the jungle is just the male version of karens
I'm sorry but this is just a copy of MagicGums video. It even has nearly the same thumbnail.
everything cool but thumbnail is rip off from magic gum ;/
eeeeeeeeeeeee
I think the arctic civilization had a way nicer town then the desert
All kings like the jungle king fall and the empire.
The jungle were great but the leader was not the best he didn’t take for second to think of how much power they had or how they would fight that’s why they lost
34:55 i hate that tipe of players that just want to kill everyone >:(
This is Sick!
If starkiller /starkid (I don't exactly know which it was) was the king instead of Ize I believe they might have won or atleast had a bigger chance of winning, his strategy of leaving during a full moon was very dumb and risky idea proving fatal
The real leader is the Zombie
let gooo i been chearing the jungle the whole time
I liked most the artic and desert and then jungle but I'm happy that desert wins
I am really mad because they killed starkiller
The story is MIND-BLOWING keep up the good work silver..... U are KILLING it...
Please make more of this!
Jungle civilization woulda won if they had all stuck together
Can u do a civilization of demon slayer one slayer civilization,one demon and lastly the humans btw ur hard work is insane and hats off to u bro
Desert ilke Desert
Epic!!
Is the jungle empire traitor the one that killed the cow or the assasins or was it the player who killed star?
Ize should’ve won 😞
Desert citizens are winner
Jungle supremacy, ize was irish so i may be biased.
We had 100 days 1000 days and now we have 100 players 1000 players
A war driven civilization brought to a fitting end, by someone who had a bitter end of their own and gladly served their king in death, delivering the final blow to the jungle kingdom after their pointless crusade on innocent people.   this was an amazing video full of surprises and tragedy, I would LOVE to see a sequel to this.
Do an other
If the jungle civilisation didn’t betray eachother and starkiller was the king the jungle would have had a chance
I've seen many of these videos, but this is surely the best!!!
Pls do more like this civilization video
that’s why not to be a dictator
the effort u put into these videos is insane! Keep up the good work
at first i wanted jungle to win i thought starkiller was a goodleader but when ize took control i was rooting for the desert
25:06 gets killed by a phantom silver thats a creeper
genshin impact? more like genshit simp act

GENSHIN WOOHOO IM PLAYING IT RN WITH GANYU AND ZHONG LI THAT I GOT WITH 20 PULLS
I love jungle
Pls make more like this
Jungle i think would have won if artic did not team
Jungle
Wow this was the best video I ever had watch
30:45 i cant stop laughing
This is my first time watching a video like this, and I gotta say, I would've kicked Ize. That was some unhealthy behavior there. And there's the problem: it's not a true simulation of society because there's a clear goal that incentivises violence.  Are the participants being looked after? Because this kinda experience can be quite harrowing.
Ize was a good leader and made things interesting.
I did not expect the desert to win
2:56 this is how to become nikocado avocado
vilage hidden in the sad village hidden in the leaf village hidden in the water
I love how much work goes into this.
Jungle king is behaving like Hitler
me as a genshin player hearing the liyue harbor genshin battle music is LITT
That zombie warior deserves to be king bro u know it
Best team won
Ize is really terrible no leadership just pure dictating
From start my favourite Team was desert
That new jungle leader was a complete asshole, he didn't think within reason and went too much with his gut, say whatever but he really could not lead to save his life, considering he was frowned upon. Seems like more of a "boss" than a leader
I want a second part of this😉this is just lit man 🔥
Jungle is like Germany in WW2 they were going strong but towards the end they started losing
I wish star was the leader
LE MONKE !!!!!!
I loved the jungle one bro 😎😄👍😹
That was a fun war
artic one
Love the amount of effort and love how they made the Amoung us Statue dead lol 😂 love how they did that 😂🤣😭😱
I knew desert would win everyone on their team is super experienced and they have the best team work
Looks like God wants on the side of artic
I LIke this video
Sussy among us hahahaha it's funny
Les goo i had all my hope for the desert kingdom
pls never stop making these minecraft civilization videos :)
I liked jungle until their king got the crown because he was bossy so then I started rooting for desert
Can we all agree that if starkiller was king. Jungle would have won.
bruh i hated the desert kingdom joining ARCTIC KINGDOM WICH WAS MY FAVORITE AND I HATED THE DESERT KINGDOM
Snow kingdom is my favorite but you killed them
This is so well done, the story telling, the betrayal, the drama (I sound like a terrible critic), absolutely wonderful. Loved every second of it.
i loved artic kingdom really friendly like
jungle is epic
Please do this again. I really enjoyed this.
That was fun to watch
I HATE the jungle nation and i LOVED the ice nation
Yah somehow a kid in my class got my French teacher to download genshin
Honestly speaking this felt more like a large team hunger game than a civilization simulation due to the hyper agression of the jungle
legendary video keep up the good work :)
The soundtracks are from genshin impact 🥳
I'm SURE IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO GOT GOODEBUMPS ON THE ZOMBIE ATTACKING THE KING PART
The diamond gay is indian
Minecraft Movie:

Insane video, really enjoyed it! Uhm... one tip: “begin” in past tense is “began” not “begun”, please do not get triggered.
Me who already a genshin player-😏

I'm on team desert 🏜
Ok you got sponsored by Genshin impact.. awesome
I’m sad he got sponsored by Gershwin Impact
imagine if the most powerful from all the nations banded together and took everyone over in an episode that’d be sick
Bro you just stole an idea and a thumbnail from someone who already did this
desert because I pretty like pyramids or temples
I love this this was insane pls do more
Geve us more this was so cool
Choose japenese they have a 30% gathering bonus buff and a 5% defense
I rooted for jungle but when the new king got elected i lost hope for them and then i rooted for desert and yeah this video was awesome hoping to see more of this in the future 😎👍
(spoilers!)    This was like a whole movie, Ize determined to be elected, star getting backstabbed, then Ize threatening to kill those who don't follow him in ambushing artic and in the end the desert people winning. Bravo
wait were is nestor?
I was rooting for jungle nation 😩😩😩
this entire story was epic and i didnt expect for jungle to loose! Amazing!
"Second best" potato farmer..... Big oof.
Hmm the thumbnail look suspiciously similiar to another youtuber civil video
squidkid is part of this?
Um monkey in latin is mono.
I want one with mods
Why why why
This is really similar to WW2 🤔
But they died
I loved the jungle
you know what im Subcribing
My favorite civilization is desert because one of them are genius Im talking about the guy who turn the zombie to become thir team
25:06 "A player in the desert was caught off guard by a creeper" *dies to a phantom*
Desert civ is gangsta no betray to each other no drama, Joy and win
I dont like jungle king
Wow Refraction even joined what a humongous event!
I liked jungle they were determined. RIP the #Unknownking
I can feel my power!
I was playing new super mario on my wii while watching this and the music was confusing me so much because i was replaying it and on a desert level and the music was over lapping
Jungle is my favorita
Honestly if the jungle nation did not go during a blood moon they would probably have more players and if they tried to make an alliance with the desert ppl and betray them at the last second they maybe could've won,but because of they're blood lust and over confidence of winning they're chance of winning just fell in a toilet full of fire,but of course being the king with that much power and can't control yourself can lead you into making bad choices for your ppl and for you
you sound exacly like xNetxatio
Man I love the Liyue music!
RIP STARKILLER
I like desert because THEY LITERALLY MADE A ZOMBIE TO DO THE LAST BLOW HECK EVEN THE ZOMBIE EVEN ALSO HELPED DAMAGE THE JUNGLE KING so the true desert warrior was the revived zombie player
please make more of this kind of videos
I’m so sad that the jungle warrior chads didn’t win💯
3:52  ZSPDKSC3V8V5 amma get that
I loved the jungle cuz of there power
Yknow For all of Ize talk about being a superior leader.  He was kinda an idiot.  He had no leadership skill.  No chill.  No sense of safety for his people.  And actively threatened to kill like 45% of his population just because he wanted to fight someone. Basically tried to murder anyone who didn't follow his views.  Literally the only thing this guy had going for him was that he could hit things hard and basically treated it as if it were a team death match and nothing else not thinking about how making enemies with both civilizations might not be the best idea.  His only strategy was "Murder everything that isn't us".  Also he was kinda just a jerk.
Squid just got demolished
26:03 - The great march 30:30 - The battle of Dwarfs forest 33:51 - The Desert Migration 36:31 - Battle of capital valley 40:00 -The Zombie conference
ITS SAITAMA
The jungle king and his men was really evil, even killing there own men And they was SO rude Go Desert
I actually wanted jungle to win.
Feeling bad for artic
I lowkey liked the Arctic guys the most. I also liked the desert people. The only decent guy in jungle was star.
Ize was a horrible leader and caused conflict in the most uncreative way possible. He was selfish from the very beginning and didn't wan't to share his enchantment table from the very beginning. But the main reason he sucks is because of just how bad he is a being a leader. Even a selfish leader can be efficient, but he wasn't. 1. He failed to bring his team good morale, which automatically decreases their battle power 2. He killed his own teammates... In real history, killing a member of an opposing can be efficient, but considering the minimal number of people he has in his army, this was a terrible choice. 3. He could have even avoided all this by using Starkiller to increase morale, considering how cooperative Starkiller was, they would have completely destroyed all the other teams 4. Even if he didn't do the three things mentioned above, he could have planned out the arctic attack waayyyy better. By sending a few warriors for a coordinated attack the desert biome first, due to desert biome having more growth potential (cuz they received more from loot crate). A couple well geared up players could have easily taken down an entire unprepared team.  So basically, to all the people thats saying Ize is just trying to cause conflict, Ize sucks and the only reason Jungle went so far is because of their win in the build battle (which Starkiller led)... But anyways, its just a game and youtube video.........
Please make another
Talk about a good villain lol this was like an anime.
Damn... who's evil enough that could kill a player that had a cow😢
That was always my dream to play this with other players also I loved the jungle :) sadö the dodnt win:(
Ize was basically every awful roman emperor from the unbiased roman history series
History channel at 3 am be like:
you used the people as AI bots, evolutionary algorithm
Artic
This video was so good!!
Jungle's warmongering backstabbing assholes died, nothing could make more happy than seeing them lose.
I like the arctic town's sus tree
22:00 is that sovjetwomble?
I like the Arctic one the best
Did you steal magichums thumbnail?
YO SQUID KID IS IN THIS
my favorite nation was jungle
They turned into crazy, violent, none friendly peaople, and selfish.
9:01 weebs
the music for jungle biom from super Mario was perfect
Jungle king is the worst player here if he doesn't kill his team they could have won
the arctic kingdom
Artic had a great town
The desert kingdom already won when they mastered necromancy. Death it but another step to eternal victory
Glad my pick won
I feel bad for star
I think I Ize was not king nothing would have happened because the desert was ready but had no plans for war and the arctic was just peace only having escape plans
D
Ah yes the article and tropics at the same latitude Def not retarded as fuck
Sequel should be more people and more zones and loot oppirtunities
this dudes intros are sick
"Have you ever heard of Genshin Impact?" the last words of JackTBC. So heroic

BOOOOOO the desert kingdom and artic kingdom except JUNGLE kingdom cause the king's soldiers make there beautiful plan on there own for example: there hiding on there homes cause it's blood moon  but the king's plan is so very wrong. My wish if I was king in your Minecraft room, I'm gonna tell my troops that were gonna attack tomorrow morning but first, we need to enchant our weapon and armor, collect some a food and collect some a weapon supplies that we can destroy there kingdoms. Pls silver the YouTuber, view my comment. I like and I subscribe. And I don't care that you are ignoring my comment on your YouTube account. just make the jungle win next time.
30:45 my instant reaction to seeing that was about "💀🤦😂🤣"
This mother f***** killed the jungle king only for power
I was enjoying the video until genshin impact popped up. Great video though! It was fun to see each team's members interacting with each other
Thiss video is insaneeee

If the jungle attack in one group they would win
Techno is the best potato farmer
I saw it  was cheating when jungle was having 17 accidentely it did 17 to 18
Welp the jungle had underestimated the desert
the video was ruined by genshin impact sponsorship.
how do I join
tbh i wanted jungle to win until they got a dictatorship, it would’ve been way cooler to see a siege on the jungle island, the ize guy had way too big of a ego and was extremely cocky
Nooooo I wanted Jungle to win
not of a fan of the whole praising genshin impact thing
jungle dude a ween
I would like to see (and maybe join) another civilization video. It is always funny to see people interact with each other on an online game. Thanks for making amazing content! ;)
Bruh the last guy didn't even do anything  and they just executed him
We want Moreeeeee
This is great 😋
This makes me remember my Geogrhraphy test ;) The natives, expedition and etc makes me that
im glad dessert won
I liked the artic nation they are wholesome
I liked the arctic the most
14:36
Pray this dear god I accept you as my lord and savior I believe Jesus died on the cross and rose again three days later pls forgive me for all my sin amen
Genshin :O nice
This rules so hard, please make more civilization videos!!!!!
Ize did nothing wrong
Is it on xbox
The reasons why the jungle kingdom died were countless   They left during a bloodmoon  The stubborn leaders caused 2 sides in their own kingdom   They Kept fighting although they were low on supplies.   And their bloodlust caused them to get too cocky. They should have left when they had the chance
Ice dictatorship is the greatest plot in this story.
How does one join these games?
When genshin impact sponsors you,you know your special
Pls play worldbox try it buy it download it premium it
LETSGO GOOD JOB
i like the arctic the most
I'm subscribed and I love your 100days your videos are amazing hope you keep up the good work
This is probably the best Minecraft Video I've ever watched
I just enjoyed this video so much. Keep it up mate.
Chant  `Ize BAD!`
I vote for dessert they were the best well organized and very awesome
I was rooting for Jungle, Loved that they had raw power and took everything by force. Reminds me of the Spartans
i would like to see smth like this but on an earth smp map
This should be a famous thing in minecraft now this is literally my new favorite thing every day I think about this channel
Jungle deserved to win
jungle civilisation was literally Nazi Germany and Desert was the Soviet union lmfao
the arctic civil was the best  in my opinion but they got rekt so hard
I kept hearing “iyze” (or however you spell it) as “I” and was very confused
Yo! This Is So Cool.....And I'm Sure It Took U A Long Time And Effort To Make This Video.......But I Feel Bad For The Ice Kingdom, But My Favorite From The Start Is The Dessert Kingdom Soo....
i can tell that ize is a complete pos in real life
The guy who travelled with his dead teamate carried stay mad if you disagree
Pls make another video this was so cool❤
this type of content has been milked to hell but its still fun to watch funny block ppl do politics
Its either the most strength and numbers, or the power-hungry leaders that win lol.
Sequel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ize has a different mentality, making it look like he's an idiot dictator, but actually quite not? You see, Ize thinks he's better than anyone, threatening people who disagrees with him, it's a weird thing. I'm giving him a 4/10 as a leader
EPIC!
I want to be in the next one
This is so cool
Finally...an ad that I didn't skip and enjoy watching
Please more
Jungle was probably the most corrupt civilization
Wish for part 2 of this and the comeback of suep and the artic buddies
great video
Silver: "Communities of players have lived together peacefully" The entirety of the MC population: "Ever heard of hypixel and crystal pvp?" Literally no one: "yes"
Im waiting for one day for one of these nations to create the missile submarine or the world eater machine and nuke the living sh*t out of the other nations. Was also hoping the desert nation abused the blood moon to get tons of gunpowder and use the sand around them to create a massive explosive in case they got attacked.
Jungle
Arctic was the best how could you
Magic gum is better
Ice was gonna win if the desert and artic didnt join together
It makes sense that the desert kingdom was the one that survived. First and foremost they were targeted second, after the ice kingdom, which gave them more time to prepare, but more importantly, they were more organized than either. They were forced out of neccessity to form a cohesive community that worked together and that's where their strength was. The Jungle kindgom was almost immediately blessed with everything they needed to start out with, and as such didn't need to form such an organized nation, eventually the prosperity lead to a power struggle that resulted in the war monger taking charge as they were all afraid of the common threat of a conflict with another nation. Then, in a complete 180 he lead them all to invade the ice kingdom immediately without hesitation, threatening to kill off his own people if they disobeyed him, or even questioned him. I believe the jungle kingdom's biggest mistake was their complete disregard for their people, treating all of them as disposable, and not taking the time to make a proper strategy for conquering the other kingdoms. This is highlighted when their king killed of one of their loyal subjects for being their opposition during the election. They may very well have survived if it werent for their ruthless killing of their own, but instead they became hyper millitaristic and self absorbed, destroying their own advantages simply in an attempt to grab power. Essentially, The Desert kingdom was forced to work together, making a cohesive nation that was formed to be efficient. The Ice kingdom was able to form a cohesive nation through similar struggle, but wound up not being efficient with their resources. The Jungle kingdom had no driving factor to make them become cohesive, it all just formed through the charasmatic leadership of StarKiller, and despite his glib, he was the only reason they formed one group to begin with, other than the impending doom of a potential clash with another nation. Ize started and ended through the subversion of his kingdom and it's resources, collecting all his resources for himself and used his power to dominate his competition, along side his rheteric, fast talking, and interruptions to force people to listen to him. The Jungle kingdom was advantaged in every way except for when it came down to being a community, which was its ultimate flaw. Frankly they should have been the ones who were successful, they had every opportunity to become more powerful together, insuring that materials went to where they were needed, and that proper defenses were constructed that would have made their jungle an impenetrable fortress with enough power to project it outwards in offensive attacks, but they wound up nearly starving to death in the easiest place to grow food and allowed one of their members to just fuck around getting materials only for themselves, which they painted as a good thing saying that they wouldn't have an enchantment table if they he didn't do that, which he then went on to invalidate as a benefit by not sharing his resources amongst his peers, being one of the few with full diamond armor, while some still had only iron. Ize took most the materials and power for himself while also expecting that all his people go on a suicide mission in order to be victorious, which of course, he would be one of the few to bask in their glory, being one of few left alive after the invasion of two other kingdoms. Of course, this is a game, I'm not taking criticizing any of these people seriously, but it is a very interesting insight into how civilizations form and what causes them to fall. It's kinda funny how quickly the Jungle Kingdom would have fallen if there were more nations, but to be fair they probably only considered that tactic because there weren't many other nations to deal with and they mopped the floor with the Ice Kingdom, leading them to believe that another suprise attack would yield similar results. If I were to suggest a new experiment, it would be to collect 1000 players, immediately spawn them evenly across advantageous locations around the world, naturally separated by land and sea, and let them naturally form into nations, perhaps with just a little bit of help by spawning them generally close together, and reminding them that other nations could wipe them out if they don't work together. Then it wouldn't be as likely to have one tribe essentially blitzkrieg another, or for a large proportion of a certain people to ditch everyone else in the pursuit of personal wealth. It would be a very difficult experiment to properly pull off though.
what's the song used at 6:48
This is the most entertaining video I’ve seen in a while so much going on with the drama of jungle kingdom to the zombie player killing the remaining jungle player.
I wonder if jungle picked a different leader what will happen?
This looked really cool and I'm now playing Genshin Impact.
Please make a new one!
Hi yea can you please join it by
The artic shall live forever
I wanted jungle to win. 😭 Good jobs desert you guys did amazing. ❤️
I feel so bad for the Arctic.
This is a whole movie
First I liked Jungle, then I was rooting for the other two
Nice one more please
21:56 - “This guy’s not saying anything we don’t know! Boooo!”  “Guys, don’t be persuaded - he just has an accent!”  💀💀
Honestly the best one of these I've seen yet
i wish the artic did not die they are just having fun
I wanted desert to win :P
Of course squid kid was making a potato farm, he had to.
Can u pleeeease make another video like this??? I want to join too plz let me know if u gonna make one like this thx!!
OMG I just noticed this, Ize is a yotuber with almost 300k subs, I missed this guy's videos love to see him on a video with Silver.
Jungle is better but they all did good
Th guy at 5:00 took the hit for every one else what a hero
I'm glad the desert won
I know those mysterious players and I know their skins and I definitely don't like that that's I would rate this video top 10 if it wasn't for those just want to classic videos of these I've seen others
DO IT
I felt so bad for the arctic
next time you could try using the origins mod to simulate different species in a civilization
Yo ize did starkiller dirty bro
JUNGLE sucks [ARTIC] they screwed us
Plsssaa
Silver can i join when you make a server
I wanna be in ur vids but I don't have minecraft😢
It is very good
Desert deserved the win. They did so well. Ize was a good leader tho.
i liked the tempels
The kid that gave enchants to the forest group sounds like he is a "hey man leave her alone" kid 💀💀
Oh look the same thing i saw 50 times before
Ize was an asshole, and he deserved to lose. You don’t get people to follow you by threatening to them. He was what cause him team to lose.
i hate this video, why. You should've gave the arctict the best loot they  had the most spirit
minecraft players are too inmature to simulate a civilization
LOL second best potato farmer
i like susmas tree in snow i hope they win jungle are heartless
Can cracked accounts join in case you make another vid like this?
I think an important lesson we can learn from here is how Tyranny can manifest through the failure of the group to do something about it.  Jungle leader was ruthless and determined to get his goal via bloodshed and subjegation and because of that, the people couldn't naturally like him. Starkiller got power through cooperation and encouragement, so people generally liked him. However, Jungle Leader was determined to be on power whatever it took, and it was because of Starkiller's naivety that got him, and his kingdom destroyed.  Jungle Tyrant was very cocky and ruthless, and he used that ruthlessness to force his power upon people. And because the Jungle citizens didn't bother to even speak up against this Authoritarianism, they eventually fell down to collapse because of the leader's impulsive decisions to wage war on anyone.  This is a lesson that if you have a leader that you know you don't like, especially if it is a tough guy, it is important to speak up.  Also an important thing to note is that if the Jungle citizens strongly rallied to Starkiller's side, they would have had a better chance of surviving. But sadly, Jungle Tyrant took advantage of the people and Starkiller's naivety.  Jesus I never thought I would make a small essay about politics in Minecraft, but here we are.
you can see the guy place the diamond ore... 2:15
I was Really rooting for the jungle nation
30:07
Btw silver how do ppl join
this was an amazing video! I really enjoyed how much dialogue you included from the players, it was really fun and definitely worth the 40 minutes of my time!

DO MORE OF THIS!!!!!!
2:28 yes, TECHNOBLADE IS THE BEST POTATO FARMER!!!
Squid kid made a potato farm oml
"Lead by the best potato farmer, sorry SECOND best potato farmer. . ." Savage.
Jungle kingdom kinda fell off after starkillers death tbh
I liked the desert team.
more of this pls so awsome
Bro helped his team even after death  💀
Like how there’s an actual winner in this
17:41
Shots　fired，　poor　squid  Edit - Ave, true to soup
19:30 I would have ordered that the complete opposite way
That was the most satisfying thing I’ve seen in while
Already know that
i liked artic the best. it had squid kid.
I want to be in these, but I need to buy minecraft
If only jungle wasn’t too fast they could’ve just made a Democratic monarchy with a prime minister and royalty
No I was rooting for jungle
Jungle
Well coop would make the jungle players to be op but there's no coop in my eyes
This was amazing! Please do more Civilization videos! Great Work 😃 Also, Great background music.
I hate the desert they even didnt fight
Squid kid didn't deserve that bro, techno already took his pride XD
Woo desert
theres a video in your ads
R.I.P starkiller
Jungle was cringe and i felt bad for Arctic. But good job to Desert for winning anything but jungle lmao.
THE DESERT ZOMBIE IS AMAZING LMAO
Somebody should make a mod or datapack for the classes
Why did u let Ize be so toxic to the players? Good Job anyways
im too younge to play genshin impact
MagicGum appears to have spawned a whole new subgenre of Minecraft Vid This is unusually goo though.
squid kid was right. you ARE sick
I loved the jungle team the best <3
me LOVE squid kid. me LOVE him me watch potato wars and help him. me think squid kid iz best. techno dident have homework like he did. and techno had TRUE power..... COFFIE
WOW I didnt even notice you are at 1.76M subs! Good job, I was here since 10k
i like arctic. it has squid kid :/
The Blood Moon rises once again, please be careful Link
At 2:15 , look closely and you’ll see that the guy placed down diamond ore and then mine it. It’s sad how that scene was planned out.
i love artick but the most i like desert but i hate junggle
that boss With a giant Sword must be a uchiha
love ur vids
Yo I cant wait to get minecraft and join these there so awesome
genshin theme in a minecraft video
The snow Kingdom and I like the second command the admiral the one that duty the one that have the duty to block the tunnel
IM SO SO PROUD OF YOU GENSHIN SPONSORED YOU
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAAHABAHBBBBBAABBAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHA “sorry- the second best potato farmer”
Its amazing how the arctic ppl made a christmas tree and singing being the happiest ever 🥺🥺😭
That looks fun
The time when he had to use only little men to attack the arctic was like a ragnar moment
Jungle was my favorite it was funny to watch then fight eaxhother
Hay i was rotting for desert
I was rooting for the artic team and then ice betrayed desert so ugh team desert now lmao
the genshin music in the background though. it fits well.
I hate Izy
yooo desert for the win. i didn't like jungles leader though he was too cocky.
The desert team sucks Jungle! Jungle! Jungle! Jungle!
i like the desert
Ive been waiting this video like 24 days but thx.nice vid btw
The jungle group literally sums up America and its political views.
Silver pls make more like this, i SUBCRIBE plsss
All Hail The Desert Wasteland Wanderers and Their Great King and Abstrekt will be remembered and worshipped like a Hero
A civilization event is not good without a civilization destroyer but it's good enough to be considered a masterpiece even without the civilization destroyer
This was seriously intense
2,656,268 views, 104k likes, 6.5k comments, 1.76M subscribers. Nice!!
Bro artic biome was so wholesome yet took last
The arctic nation was so wholesome, they really deserved the win.. No other nation were as social as them I felt so sad about their lost 😞
Ngl I kinda had hopes for jungle 🥱
He even used the music of the game like Liyue's fighting music.
You should definitely do this again but with 4 civilizations like artic, jungle, desert, and grasslands. So there could be more diversity in the war and different attack strategies
dang i was rooting for the jungle civilization. Nice video!
desert
I like how the last jungle player 1 vs 11 like heh seems easy enough
How did the arctic lose the town build competition my list is 1) arctic town 2) desert town 3)jungle town
They Are The Worst
I Like the Arctic Not The Jungle
invictable, it was so worth it
i liked the arktic
This was a great video! I was so happy to see jungle lose, I hated their leader (no offense) the other person in the jungle people was much more kind, and I would have routed for the jungle nation if they had him as their leader.
I like jungle until star got killed
Actually 3rd tecnoblade
38:00 GIVE THAT ZOMBIE A MEDAL!!!
SILVER! I have an idea for yours civilization videos, make the king choose a flag and more territory system! It could be cool ☺️
The jungle dictator showed more leadership than all of the other Kings. After all it was a game where the last civilization left standing wins.
"lead by the best potato farmer, oh wait the second best potato farmer" That was brutal
Ok
WHAT HAPPEN TO THE ARTIC SURVIERS
Ayo what happened at 2:15? I saw that.
* c i v i l i z a t i o n *
SQUID KID
Bruh desert only wom because the ice village joined forces, that proves that jungle are stronger than both o the villages
The "Who is making among us" got me dying
We want second part where there could be more civilications to defeat dessert team i wish jungle has won :(
Really cool video! Any chance I could get a link to the modpack/datapack used for the class system?
Arctic was peaceful and I loved there people form what I saw definitely my favorite
the artic should get first
So The rulers that are mostly trained into being warriors or part of a military system always have a greater fall than a rise gotcha
Mob idea: The Grunt.  Details: The Grunt has 50 HP and does 3.5 damage, it is a spider-like creature that naturally spawns in sculk growths. It cannot smell, so it relies on its hearing to find pray. Upon death, there is a small chance that nearby blocks will be converted into sculk blocks.  Sculk Shrieker changes: There will now be two possible outcomes for activating a sculk shrieker, either a Warden will spawn, or 10+ Grunts will spawn.
artic noooooooo
if the jungle nation had made starkiller king they wouldve won
I just need to say that the arctic had the best town. It looked so good compared to the others, ur insane bro
Wow mand really got Squid kid on the channel that's awesome I love that guy
The desert avenging the tundra was kinda nice to see
Noooo
The jungle would have won if they had starkiller as the leader
I wanna see a sequel but I want u in the action
jungle leader is crazy
Rise of kingdoms but in minecraft be like:
bro ize jungle leader dead built like nero also go snowy team
Jungle
IZE??? AS IN CUBE SMP IZE???
the jungle nation could have been move orderly. They could have won. just look at the romans
spend 100 days as a  end shapeshifter
dude ize was annoying
28:05 = d-day
So I can find a supply drop outside of my house
Technoblade never dies!
When star killer died I started rooting for desert
jungle best
I think a cool idea would be to have 1 kingdom, and give the players a certain amount of days to establish an economy and a government then soon send their strength to the test by having raiders or mobs invade and see if their kingdom can hold
Jungle army literally blitskrieg'ed Artic army
The shade shot at squid kid hurt bro dang 😢
squid kid RIP potato 1st  is now techno [has been]
NOOOOOOOOO WHYYYY DID JUNGLE DIE!!!! WHYYYYY!
L Squid kid
Dude that was insane! I was going for the ice nation, keep up the good work
Sequel with the same teams
Bro you HAVE to make more this was amazing and maybe not edit that much out so we can have a longer video since it’s so great
I like how you stole the thumbnail and idea from magic gum
I really, really, really hope that the jungle didn't win the building competition just for the monkey. If that's so I would be really , really pissed.  SPOILER:    At least they didn't won.
Make this but bud a command block underground and see what happens
i wish i was in this :’D
Genshin impact sucks
love how he used the genhsin music in the vid lol
You should do this again, this is awesome!
why am I so annoyed he didn't credit XD
I liked the jungle most valuable but gg
ANJAY GENSIHIN IMPACT WIBU YA MEN 🙂
NO NO NO NO NOT GENSHIN IMPACT
ize is so annoying
I wanted desert to win and LOOK AT THAT!
Wassup man uhh hey... do you know the Seed to the world the you made pls 🙏
Bro the super Mario wii music gave me a butt ton of nostalgia
I was going for artic and I hated jungle because of their leader
the jungle king was such a villain it's incredible
I wish I had twitter
Ngl that looks fun😳
How do you join one of these? I looked in Twitter but I can’t find it.
What map
best content creator..👍🏻👍🏻
I loved how the desert worked together and the other ones turned against each other, the desert is the nicest civilization. They deserve to win.
Sequel
How to I join these
amazing, would love to see more!!
You should have squid and techno in one of these videos in different civilizations
Artic!!!!!!
Ice
Hey I like the artic
6 days ago
Wow Stalin came back. Shame.
you stole this video idea from magicgum
I liked the desert village most because they had the best feeling town, sad I couldn't be part of this
This was a movie on its own i was glad when IZE died he was like a movie villan
The jungle clan reminds me of Yharim the jungle tyrant cuz of how powerful and feared he was to other people.
Jungle jungle jungle jungle
That sure is an original thumbnail..
I like how desert thought Arctic had a civil war even though Jungle was closest to a civil war at multiple points.
Nentendo is gonna copyright claim this video
Arctics town was sooo much better what
wish it was jungle
jungle should have won ok
If Ize and Starkiller teamed up the jungle would have been unstoppable. With Star's sheer chrisma and his calm mind Ize would have had more strategy then just a suprise attack. If Ize shared more loot too they wouldn't have lost
Question what about console players
Just like the majority of your videos, they are sadly just copied from other creators, it would be cool if you had an actual original idea
This is the new mrbeast minecraft video he hasn't posted it yet
I would be in the Arctic Civilization because im from Wisconsin (or Minnesota 2)
What is everyone talking about ize was a douche and it seemed like he made it unfun
bro you put so much effort into your vids, always look forward to watchin them.
I actually love how the jungle leader was a villain in this story, it made things so interesting to have a bad leader that ended up killing the nation! (Spoiler) he basically won over his nation, forced them to war, won, went into war AGAIN and his nation was killed. This is a great story and I love that someone did this so it was actually interesting. Great vid
if the jungle kingdom stayed together in that desert raid and protected each other the jungle would have won. Rip jungle.
wow its like those shitty kingdom mobile games but less shitty!
Attic was my favorite
Feel like Arctic should have won, but that’s just my opinion
Wheres skyblock
I’ve deserved the win. Ruthless yet smashing general. A modern day Caesar
Reminds me of lord of the rings
Plex make a sequel
I'm watching this while waiting for genshin to load
Omg squid was there
The leader of the Jungle low key acted and sounded like the biggest douchebag ever
i loved arctic, they seemed so wholesome :D
I'm surprised Ize got as far as he did. His strategy of leaving during the Blood Moon was a terrible idea that led to unnecessary casualties, and him going back to the village by himself to the people proven to be disloyal to him was a risky move; as even though he had good gear and more health they could have easily just fought him as they greatly outnumbered him. Had a fitting end though.
Jungle
this became an unintentional human behavioral experiment.  The jungle civilization especially was interesting to watch.
when they chose the desert king they already tried to assassinate him 😂
I love it and I hate it at the same time
i was routing for artic but i knew that desert would win
bro i just noticed he copied another youtubers idea and thumbnail smh
Bro Genshin impact is for virgins , still like the video don't like the sponsor
Desert really was the best one
silver : JUMP IF YOU LIKE GENSHIN IMPACT random guy: oh genshen impact hell yeah
I loved the jungle
I am glad jungle didn’t win
👍🏻
Is he the fastest minecraft YouTube
ItsN1k0 so wholesome :)
Me (a technoblade fan) sees squid kid: TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
How do you find these server events?
Silver u should do a modded version. maybe your shapeshifter mod each civilization would have different shapeshifts
Squid still getting mildly roasted I see lol
teknoblsde is beder
OMG SqWID KID GET ONDE
Man, I would've taken that bitch ass king of the jungle out. I would've said yeah ill fight you
Jungle is political drama Arctic was vibes Desert was chaos
Jungle chould win
Artic is my favorite
This has definitely not been done before :|
Jungle on top.
Did you get the Dwraven fortess from lord of the rings because it looks like the lonely mountain Edit: Not lord of the rings the hobbit book or the movies.
this dude sounds like hes got so much snot in his mouth lmao
Anyone else notice the mario jungle desert and ice music
Bro you gotta do this again
lol its squid kid again, the not best potato farmer
Aren’t blood moons from terraria
jungle superior
This is such a well made video
squid kid was there
Will U donit again? A want a second.     And a third, and a fourth, you know...
jungle best
Damn i really enjoyed this more than I thought I would. MORE!!
I hear the Mario music in the background and I sorta think that it is not the best music. By the way I have the Mario game it's a fun game. ;)
i liked jungle the most
I have killed a ravaged with my fist how did they die
I never realized the songs you were using until you made your sponsor of Genshin Impact.  I’ve played Genshin until I stopped at 2.3, now I am big sad because I won’t be able to see what the new updates will bring to me, because the file size of the game is BEEG, so it’s too much file data for my PC and Phone to handle.
More videos like this plsss
This is fantastic!!! Definitely best video yet!! 😀
Can you do 100 players per civilisation for more content and longer vids
play rlcraft
All the king wants is war he is A bad king
Respect + to starkiller, may you rest in peace
squidkid
when he showed the ppl that joined at 0:09 i sawx nestorio
2:20 you nearly got onto technoblades hitlist
No wonder jungle lost with a cocky, undiplomatic leader who's only goal was to gain power. If you look at history, leaders like him had successes, but in the end failed miserably
Battle of the first evasion. 29:23  Battle for domination 36:14
StarKiller would have been a better king. Ize was terrible.
anybody here found  the jungle king pretty upsetting?
wait are you telling me people actually like genshin?
Mi
idea for a survivial open world medieval style map with some aspects of legend of zelda in it 3 nations "lanayru" "eldin" and "faron"    faron being the sort of forest/jungle civilization at the center is the great deku tree the deku tree has a great secret that resides within.  eldin the hotter climate desert and mountain like at the top of the volcano deemed "death mountain" sits an acient mechancial dungeon.  and lanayru being the mainly water based with some colder mountains with a strange temple at the top. civilization video idea just something i was thinking about im a huge zelda fan  and love your videos thanks for the amazing content ♥
This felt like a war documentary. This was awesome. Keep doing these they’re so fun!
Artic deserved the 1st
Necromancy YEAHH
Ize Usurped the true king and paid the price for it.
i wanted artic to and i wanted star to be king for jungle
you should make a hardcore series.
I loved that you put genshin music in the video. :)
My god 🤣 the zombie kill the king lmao the saviour of the zombie!
Ice!
0:09  NESTOR???   lol
so evil you like content over people lol... jk btw
Rise of kingdoms on minecraft
me playing genshin while listening to this is just the best because the background music is the same as the ones in genshin :D
Dang, desert really hit em' hard
Techno beat I am squid kid in potatos in sky block
i think arctic deserved the win, they were so nice :)
Thumbnail stolen and recreated though…
I am also subscriber too and me and my siblings
what if i dont have a phone and can do twitter
Why do the cool warmongering dictatorships always lose?
Am I the only one who kinda hates ize
I like the artic kingdom the best
i was like the jungle team
the most impressive take I have for this is that he got Technoblade to join it
STARKILLER FOR LIFE
I like how there was genshin music at backround it bring good vibes
Me when I see hardcore is enabled here: “ just like the simulations”
Am i the only one that hated dtar guy from jungle he reminded me of thouse kids in achool that would be friends with everyone and bs
Artic was my favorite
I vote jungle
i  wanted artic and kinda desert to win so yay
I like how the Jungle kingdom started the war and finished it...You reap what you sow yazzzzzzz 💅💅💅
Do a sequel this was my favorite video by you yet!
21:40 There were 23-22-22 not 23-25-21. or was i wrong about that?
I hate how I died first
I'm goin for the Arctic
I already play genshin
PLS DO ANOTHER ONE THERE SO GOOD
2:16 did u just plac the diamond ore
MAKE A PART 2
I hate the desert i heat the ······ desert
the desert is my favorite. not that they win but they makes the smartest choices
Coolest video i've seen in a while, im new to your channel, so nice job!
jungle hiden leaf desert gaara s home  snow mist or cloud 3 biggestv nations in naruto
The genshin music lol
ZSPDKSC3V8V5? Nice.
man, THIS is the content that im looking for, but did thee  youtubers post the vids on their channels?
The jungle king was kinda an *sshole
since when do you have 1.76 million, when I found your channel you were only at 20k
Tf jenshin impact ads
i was team desert. Gg to all the nations
Jugle
I’ve been wanting to create my own version of this sort of series. But I dunno what group I should use to host the server. Because for mine I’d also let it function 24/7. And the current group I use (aternos) needs at least 1 person online to stay active
Star killer is a legend
jungle is so bossy i wish the king of the jungle died
This feels a bit scripted, ngl.
It was so cool
I hate the guy that became jungle leader
this was very heavily sponsored, in case anyone noticed
nerf miner
lol man everytime theres a revolution in the jungle
I really wanted artic to win but they joined forces with desert so I rooted for them I wanted starkiller be king but ize was an a hole
did he just call a phantom a creeper??? and why did he say it so confidently to
do a 100 Players Simulate Civilization in rlcraft mod, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!!!
All civilisations were super cool! I was kinda hoping team Jungle would win, since their annexing success being so huge. Would definetely watch more with differend bioms or sum!!
Let me add to the sponsor genshin is soon realising to Nintendo switch but never xbox because the company hates xbox so yeah
This was a very cool video
Damn, speedsilver made it far
the map art for the sponsors though
Bro the Kings of jungle sounds like the due from the black lite district songs
Ironically I think if Jungle King kept Stars alive, they might've been able to win. Idk how good of a fighter stars was, but if he had gotten good gear and stood along side his King, I think they could've won with just one more player at their disposal.
I have a monke
whats the song at 27:30?
If technoblade seen this he would get a little mad and confused a 2:20
Fuck the deserts i voted for the jungles
i legitimately didn't know you even existed until someone on Discord asked if i was an Alt Account of yours
RATFRACTION
great vid
you misjudged the arctic            JUST WHY??!!!
Hi is there a way to get in these videos???
Can we all agree that the jungle was kinda a ruthless dictatorship?
jenshit impact (yea i play it)
This is realistic  bcs human doesnt revive
Squid kid 's great return after the technoblade skyblock saga
Long live artic Norse for you, for once a biking era, rule with an iron fist against the civilized scum of sand and trees
I liked te jungle  most
was not expecting to see squid kid
GENSHIN IMPACT
Something about ize making me cringe so hard thoo
6:46 guy saying "These aren't people." cracked me up lmfao idk why
The genshin music in the vid >>>>>>> anything else
25:05 yeah sure a creeper
I would name my civilization Switzerland and remain neutral.
tbh I was rooting for the Jungle but the Ize guy was really annoying me like he just countered all his own points and shouted he was good at pvp tho so props i guess anyway great video!
Best video ever please make more like this
I wonder how hard this is.. you have to watch the people day and night to make sure nothing happens
Even after death,  Abstrekt still serves.            Long live the Desert Kingdom!
Jungle was da beasts
19:42 Snow kingdom was better and more controlled in the right way
Loved this video, it was such a great idea to add roles in this, it was an amazing vid with all the events
jungle made the video fun to watch the rest are boring players
I'm just saying starkiller deservered to king like for some reason Ize just annoyed me
This... was... AMAZING! This whole concept was very interesting, seeing how the different nations developed and went about existence. Subbed and Liked, this easily was the best Minecraft video I've experienced in such a long time!
I really did think that the jungle wouldve won if they didnt rush because they had probably by the looks of it the most stuff as well.
if i was here i would love it
They're all great tbh I can't choose
I think desert won because they were organized and had things planned they also got more lucky than the other players. I actually dislike the jungle biome obviously and i wish the Arctic lived and it would be better to take the evil jungle king as prisoner of the desert for his crimes of killing star and raiding others. That would of been an amazing ending
This  Is  The Most Epic Thing I Have Ever Seen
Artic: Indus Valley Jungle: Romans Desert: Greeks
'second best potato farmer'      @Technoblade hey it's your war opponent
Though I like the ideals and tactics of the jungle king, his bad attitude spoils it.
Genshin impact SUCKS! IT'S A HORRIBLE GAME!
So far Ize is my favorite character
make more of this but with nether and more bioms
Genshin background and ad beutiful 👌🏽😅
jungle
Jungle was my favourite at the start but they were very mean so I like the desert players cause artic died
There is TimeDeo and Xnesterio at the beggining of the join list in the start of the video.
Juggle is a killer and I kind of liked them
jungle king braindead
Bruh they should’ve got netherright
I was rooting for Jungle ngl
I loved the jungle kingdom. Honestly such an enticing story.
It's shocking how the most shaky, and politically troubled nation almost won. And only won AND lost, because of the hostile takeover. I was rooting desert, because jungle was destroying itself.
This is so creative
Nice video and thanks for the genshin code I’m pulling for yae
Love your videos!
It puts a smile on my face seeing squid kid still active in the community
This is the most fun activity
Desert actually were my favorite since I live in egypt ✌
These vids are amazing
JackTBC at the end was basically admiral Dönitz
they literally like drake. started from the bottom now they here 😼😼
Hey int most of these builds just trixy blox’s
Rise of kingdom be like: WAIT THAT IS ILLEGAL
desret
Snow is easily the best
that wasent a "creeper"
Desert was peaceful
CAN U please do the bedrock addition vidoes there are many poeple like me that don’t have ps for Minecraft java
Wait imagine if everyone had been on board in the Jungle Kingdom and it allowed them to win, but because some were divided either at the start or all the way through, the invasion failed.
I was routing for desert 🏜
YES SULVER UPLOADED
Earned a sub my guy this is cool
yeah i dont think i can play genshin anymore it just needs too much storage
I think jungle army was strong but they had have better strategies on invasion on desert
jungle
is the aztec temple created my trixy blox?
Desert had the coolest village but jungle was the coolest civilization
More of this please!
Jungle
Oppp
make the another civilization video but if you die your dead body will tp to the body collector factory after it lays there for 3 minutes if a player no clip to some block they tp there but not on the tracks but on the safe ground also make the dead bodies ragdoll
Opppp
Op
The arctic should have gotton 1st
Oppp
It was so good !! Make new civilization videos too
https://youtu.be/a-X70iP3Vxw
I like jungle civilization
I love artic :D even they Got destroyed so Fast
silver i think you should upload faster
"Communities of players have lived together peacefully" u sure?
Keep up the awsome work i love these ki9nd of cool vids! ♥♥♥♥♥♥
Bro you gotta do this again this was so entertaining!
correction: you can only control 6 elements in genshin until they add a dendro character
I loved the jungle civilization and their ruthlesss king and actions, rip they fell
I like the jungel´it was ah lot of movments there when the other just chilled
Cmon man be more creative for the thumbnail u just stole that from MagicGum
i liked jungle team
Just vibin with the Mario bros music
38:15 even in death, I serve
Artic
The editing is so good
This is my opinion:  1. Desert  2. Artic 3.Jungle because the leader was too cocky
noice
Why do I feel like soup was the best player in the server
Im so glad jungle did not win
I was really rooting for suep in this one, it was really cool seeing him try his best to survive and save the Arctic nation despite the odds.
I loved the arctic civilization and the desert, but i was really rooting for Starkiller to be kind, so im glad the jungles died. No offense to Ize
a
artic civilisation ;-;
YOOOO FINALLY U ARE BAAACK
The Ize guy is the kinda dude irl to vandalize a car and say “it’s just a prank”
Your Lucky techno didn't find this video and get angry that you called squid kids the best potato farmer for a second there
Jungle king is annoying asf!🤣
You definitely  took some  heavy inspiration lol jk these things take a lot of effort also some one should  definitely  make one of these with the with the create mod it be really  cool
0:03 yeah "peacefully"
mans playing genshin combat music lol
Can u make something else like this soon pls, this was amazing maybe I will see if I can join the next 1 but prob not
Loved the techoblade joke
Was rooting for the jungle
This video was insanley fun to watch i really enjoyed it and would he happy if u made another one
Imagine he makes a part two  with even more crazy players
Is jungle kingdom just an off brand lamanburg
hey see what would happen if all civilization was in prison  and they ether escaped or accepted their fates
you deserve tommys subs more than him or any youtuber that just got famous cus of others
imagine if they make a group of legendary warriors like seven deadly sins by having insane stuff and skills
this is cool and funny
28:19 1. (Jungle VS Arctic) 37:24 2. (Desert VS Jungle) 39:19 3. (11 Desert Players VS                   1 JUNGLE KING)
I felt bad for Arctic kingdom
I thought by far that the jungle town was the ugliest LMFAO
Noooooo jungle was so good im so sad :(
I liked jungel most
Plz do another one
there is no strategi or someone who think about the desisions, there is a lot of ways on winnig with no effort if you only think a minute
This video just shows how people do anything to get great power👑
Ice was a great leader of the Jungle Kindgom
BROOOOO WHAT???!!! i loved this video it was soo G O O D! Keep up the good work and have a good day :D
this was so amazing u should do a lot more of these. Also i was rooting for desert since i liked how they got the dead member back to “life”
plz create more but with other biomes
The fact you used genshin combat music is cool.
I really want to be in one
The jungle kingdom was self fulfilled prophecy. I hope the wish to be proxy king learned of what it means to rule through greed.
This is so cool! MORE
Ize was kind of a prick. That wasnt all fun and games, being 'rude' for fun and content. He was genuinely being a prick because he wanted everything to go his way. He didnt let anyone have fun. :/
I love the  Arctic nation they're peaceful
no credit to magicgum?
This is like a movie
fantastic
artic
Jungle kingdom got karma because of that king LMAO
I liked the snow civilization
Why is the artic always losing
GENSHIN IMPACT
jungle was best even if it lost
Who the heck is making among us lol
Silver do you now mrbeast
Part 2
Jungel
“They all became headless chickens there and didn’t listen” he said after uprooting their entire sense of fair rule and killing their leader lol
Potato chain:
karma ize
u better play multiplayer i guess cause i like it n of corse more fun🙂😄
I like jungle because they was brave
can i donwload the map
This was genuinely so interesting to watch, really keen to see more of this type of experiment. Subscribed
Wow, I loved this so much!! Pls make part 2!
#StopYouTubeScammers
#StopYouTubeScammers
aw man i got sleep deprevation and didn't get featured D:
the fact that he used genshin impact soundtracks is just amazing i play the game and love it
i liked arctik the most becuise they had best buylds
Iuz is an awful leader. Classic tyrant
Desert kingdom are ruthless
5:01 man literally sacrificed himslef
I would be interested in the mod list / server setup you did for this video seems like a fun season-based community server.
What's the cow gonna do hahah
I want more of that !!!!
ISH WAS A MENACE
This is so entertaining
i LIKED JUNGLE BY FAR
That forest player was the cringiest thing my eyes ever witnessed
i can feel my powerr!!!😉
im sorry i cant join u lol im in phone is bedrock guys their or only java
"have you ever heard of genshin impack"
Desert kingdom is the best
I liked the desert civilization, don't know why.
Starkiller got done dirty
This was very enjoyable. It kinda makes me want to start one.
L JUNGGLE KING
is it just me or does ize feel like a dictator. (whatever he says goes, threatening anyone who didnt obey him, killing anyone who had different ideals,  powerhungry)
lmao i loved Desert all the way
Ize_: I’m going to elect myself king. Is that okay with you?”  Random dude: “Uhhh… no.”  This cracked me up lol. I’m also considering joining one of these.
i know its a lot of work but please take all the time and come with more of these PLEASE!
Me:*watches the video*  Him:*sponsoring genshin impact*  Me:no no no no no no no no not that ok not that *spams in the screen by tapping to skip* there we go
noo i was in jungle side
TY FOR GIVING THE LINK I WANTED THIS GAME FOR SO LONG!
Alright if i play minecraft and spawned on a dessert i will appreciate it
25:40 o7
Now I would pleasure to see a Mountain Range Civilization, Ocean Civilization and a Savannah too.
I’ve one. They were funny
This is just the same as magicgum
Best video i've ever seen!
When the cow died he said it was a mistake mi-steak
5:00 he died in hero
I wanted tundra to win
35:50 this had me dyinggg!!! 😭😭👌
Dude theres a little thingy when everyone's joining I spotted nestor and painful joining too Hmmmmmm
He used genshin music im happy
For all the talking that the Ize guy did, he sucked at PVP and died with the most OP gear he could possibly have LMFAO
It’s the skyblock man
I feel bad for Starkid, I think he would've wanted to work with Ize anyway if he was elected and he might have agreed to the war too. Ize said he was doing the right thing by rushing but with the gear the rest of the civilization had, it was pretty much just ruthless.
Honestly, I felt that the desert civilisation was ruthless and merciless as they sort of tortured the last jungle player with the zombie. Although some might not want to hear my opinion, I just really hate the Desert players
Man's last words were "Have you ever heard of Genshin Impact?" XD
This guy really puts a lot of efforts in his videos  Love ur voice btw <3
As Soon as starkiller died i wished there would be a traitor killing the king even destroying its team
PALIKKA IS IN THERE
HAHA GOT ROASTED SQUID KID
Poor squid kid is still getting cyberbullied by techno, even in video's without techno.
jungle
9:07
The jungle leader was so annoying
Im really interested how this looks like of it's animated since the story is great
My favorite nation is the arctic nation
i love how he used the genshin ‘in combat’ music as background music.
I dunno but I loved the Jungle kingdom.
I like the jungle
Definitely want more videos. I supported the jungle kingdom and I want them to take revenge.
The second best potato farmer 😂😂
I liked the winter kingdom
Everything good, but he's voice... OMG
This is amazing!!!! always wanted to do something along these lines, would love to see a technological era in the future
Man the jungle kingdom sucked
Artic  was a nice Nation but Jungle is so dang ruthless suep the only artic left betrayed Dessert and died ain't in my mind
Wow nice vid man
Deep down the snow were the evil one
Poor squid
I felt bad for that last jungle player  I thought he would get some kill but unfortunately i was wrong he died without getting a single kill (ﾉ´･ω･)ﾉ ﾐ ┻━┻*flips the table* If i was there i would have used redstone traps to get them one-by-one  Anyways your vids are amazing :)
I want another one like this plssssssssss
Teavat
15:08 that zombie did nothing wrong he did good taking out the cringe
How do you join an event like this HOW I realy want to do that too
artic nation was the best and their military general was so good.
Bad
0:09 technoblade lolllllll
Make more please I like it so much 😁😁😁
Amogus
i was watching u from 50k subs nice job
Bruh better than napoleon wars
good video
The jungle could have probably won if they like towered up and made a lava rain and had like bows with fire damage because of the lava but good video wish to see more :)  Edit: made a typo
Desert lest gooooooo
sponsored by genshin..... wow!!!
the liyue battle theme song hit hard in the exploration part
This idea you got from magicgum?
They all rockin warden helmets tho
Imagine died early in the video, but your player-less body still makes it until the final and even have some highlights. That one player who boats the zombie and that zombie’s mvp.
May I asked why havee you not uploading a lot as you upload every 1 month to 5 months nowadays?
DESERT!
Ize is such an asshole like he treated his team and how rude he was to starkiller who was actually very nice and starkiller while not really a good strategist than Ize, He genuinely went to save a "dying" teammate and then being killed because of the resultness of his kind and naive nature.
i followed since 76k
damn that jungle guy cocky as hell
SILVER IS BACCC BOISSS
That desert zombie was a true warrior
Ya desert winnn
Ебать,а че так ахуено
Let's all be honest we were all rooting for the Arctic civilization
Ggs the desert guys won this owoowowo
bro aint no way... i just saw this video on my reccomended, i use to watch ur uhc videos like 2 - 3 years ago, when u also played with wisp, man i miss them days, ur doing so well now tho, good job
omg bro no way, ive just seen u on my recommended, i use to watch ur uhc videos all the time.
Is genshin impact song is not copyright
Xnesterio plus you = god
The first time I see the blood hungry nation lost
15:08 that's what you genshin impact players deserve
i love artic they good
The king of forest was so evil .. I don't know if he is that ruthless and manipulative in real life if he is I hope he burns in heck and never come back like afton *plays fnaf song *   FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S IS THIS WERE YOU WANT TO BE , I JUST DON'T GET IT
The desert Kingdom is the best
Now do a Civ VI version, you play that don't you?
Only legends know who squid kid is
God that dude is so power hungry for a small leadership role in Minecraft 😂 we see who has no friends 😂😂😂
Can i join to the srver
Do
I love this with the jungle chaos with the players that killed the cow and steal loots,Betrayal,King selection and the Assassination to Star Killer just GORGEOUS
i had genshin impact before but its like 25gb or smth so  i cancled it
Jungle could have survived if they had played a little more tactically and with a better leader, not just strong but smart.
My favorite is the Arctic cause theyre civilization is so peaceful and so organized and they teamwork is Cheff Kiss and I was hoping Jugle won cuz Arctic has no chance but after the king died I lose hope
suep
This was insnae! The sheer amount of lore in this video makes it seem like a piece from medieval history! Your content is extremely entertaining and I look forward to the sequel!
Artic is the cutest place and jungle I hate it they were rude to win and dessert ehh good they trusted thrm
This video was really interesting to watch and i loved it! Keep it up👏
Idea: do a civilization thing and everytime someone dies replace them with a different person and in the end make a volcano erupt destroying every region
Man i really wanted the snow to win
Damn it! Whose server do I need to join to participate in this?????
i just saw refraction and palikka there hol up some thing aint righ-
It would be really cool to see a sequel to this, great work on the video!
The jungle king was selfish and only cared  about war and not his men. The other leader was the pick but society picked power over plan.
Seed?
#100 days
As they said, the necromancer was their best build
I have genshin and I want raiden shogun she's powerful 😩 AND YOUR VIDS ARE SIMPLY JUST AWESOME
Get wrecked genthin kid
In the name of siberia the cold isn't bad unless you have hyperthermia you better stay home ok
Im getting potato war flashbacks
I voted for artic I think jungle was a bit chaotic
Why do I hear Genshin Impact soundtrack from Liyue at 6:40
this hasn't been done 10 times already
at first i like artic bc i tho they were kind but they try to betray desert and i lost hope on them and become the desert supporter which they never attack and was attacked by 2 region what a great region i ever seen
Jungle should've stayed and probably fortified their position, i mean they were in an island and personally i think that was a good position they could make big walls and used bows
Ize was the worst leader out of them all. Super cocky, not taking any blame, and sacrificing his own people so he can live.
Am I the only person that gets excited whenever I see Silver upload? Amazing video every time!
Please more
I'm glad the jungle king lost. He sucked. Seemed like more of a tyrant. The other candidate was better
At 26:56 I got Omaha beach flashbacks
YOU KNOW WHAT???      Just take my sub
This feel like a movie , very great video
CanI join?
This is like the best video I have seen in a pretty long time.
Spoiler alert!     I knew desert would win! I was sticking to desert the whole time lol
I like how there is Genshin music
You help the desert to kill one of th jungle using your statue
bro the desert just cheaped there way outta victory the jungle actually took the good approach and u also using TrixyBlox's desert temple at the end
silver please make more civilization videos it was very interesting
Wow
I wanted jungle to win 😢😢
JUNGLE TEAM!!
Insane Video !!!
I always keep thinking, is genshin impact a game only for girls? till I don't get the answer or if it turns out to be a game for only girls, I am too scared to download it
Ha squid kids a noob why not techno
I'm team Artic cause I like snow and I liked there town cause there's a Christmas tree I'm team artic what did you do to them
That was awesome, had to sub for more
no genshin impact adds
Jungle
genshin pogg
Good video, but I was getting physically sick from Izes personality so had to stop a little after he became the king.
The Jungle made a mistake by going for Artict first, They should have gone for desert in their first assault seeing how they're the most threatening Resource, gear and number wise. Artic was heavily under geared, no point of going after them and wasting the element of surprise
Caste system, democracy, political bro in a block game yes
WE NEED A SEQUEL PLEASE!
I wanted arctic to win
Boo to Ize
Jungle Kingdom would've been 1000 times better if Ize wasn't the leader. He was better as warrior. He was mean, brutal and otherwise warrior like, while Star was leaderlike.
Silver: he's the second best potato farmer  Squidkid: *and I took that personally*
Gg desert
You deserve 10 mil subs do you make my day everytime you upload!
I was so happy that the desert won
im a genshin impact player
nah bro the jungle made so many mistakes they could have won
My favourite YouTuber is back and your content is amazing!
Jungle was the best
jungle the best
We want Moreeee!!!!!!!!
Omg
I support the militaristic jungle faction
Team jungle
I'm not really that mad that The Dessert Won, Atleast jungle lost
thanks for abstrekt for winning desert!
Bro everyone in this comment section is hating on the Jungle's King, calling him a douchbag and worthless player, I'm here to prove otherwise, here is my arguments:           Thanks for reading!
Jungle could have won if they had listen to Ize from he said wanted to be king
The Epicness level of this video is on par with Mr. Beast Squide's game. !!  Make it a full-blown show, I am sure many will be eager to join in
We want more
i liked jungle the most
Bro that desert zombie is the only character that matter to me
MagicGum 2.0 LMAO (no hate btw)
Artic team was mad 🤣🤣
It's not a video it's a complete movie
To be honest, I am glad the Desert Kingdom won.
Second greatest farmer lol
My cat is named silver
that boy ize was either taking the rollplay very seriously or he has several mental problems.
Anddddd subscribe
the among us statue was sus :)
I liked jungle but the leader I don’t like
How’d jungle win the base shit
Bruh genshin impact really its cringe af have ya seen that nah hell no not my son meme?
哈哈，那个哥们临死前说我家里还有牛需要照顾
the jungle was very powerful but disorganized
Toram online os better imo
One more
A sequel with the 3 dimensions pls
i liked the artic
Nice potato war reference.
What did you host the server on?
You should do 4 billion next
i liked and subbed
sometimes i imagine.. what if earth was minecraft like? living skeletons, zombies, dragons, 3 headed bosses,  minecraft like caves, etc
jungle
Thats too interesting I'm play this plzzz ❤️❤️❤️
The mandalorians in the thumbnail is 👌
"Arctic Is Such a Peaceful Sivilisation" Min later Spawned a ravager wiping out a half of it's population
I was rooting for jungle until Star was killed, then I wasn't rooting for anyone anymore, I was just rooting AGAINST jungle.
Nothing like wining a invasion to gain respect from your army
The desert is so beautiful build 😊💟
Desert
I like the jungle civilization. any civilization that starts in the jungle the elections how they were they were experienced in battle and they also have the advantage a guerrilla warfare if they were being attacked but it didn't happen
Don’t you mean The Hunger Games?
That was the smoothest transfer into an add I’ve ever seen
I liked Artic the most I defiantly think they were the most friendly out of them and had quite a bit of more interesting buildings
Definately earned a sub from me. Can't wait to see more of these!
DESSERT IS OP, ik they will win when i first saw them ;)
Bro Squid got destroyed
Ize was a a hole through this video gear doesn't mean anything. They could have a plan in case they got invaded star killer should have been king
Jungle should’ve won
“Gosh”
the arctics best
The zombie is the true warrior here 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
silver should do a part 2 with like end overworld and nether colonies
Dude you got to do another one of those and have the jungle king in there to he I think was a good leader
Wtf speedsilver grew so much since last time I watched him for skyblock
Very cool 😎
It’s all your fault to let the coldkingdom die
Desert for me although I rooted for the Artic towards the end
This gives me old dwraves vs zombies vibes
ize is such a garbage leader LOL
How does the Jungle have the best town? It looks way worst than the desert or arctic. Half of the buildings aren’t even completed. Arctic’s town looked WAY better.
DONT KILL PANDAS -_-
IZE YOUR A GENUIS
The end reminded me of When Napolion invaded Russia but Russia fought back when they reached Moscoe
Ok, but when is sb video?
"led by the best- wait I read that wrong. The second best farmer." Oooof
Dannng the Jungle kingdom should have gone in with a bit more strat like digging underground for a surprise attack or hsing TNT, rather than charging straight in after a battle.
pov your me:Damn i wish i had Minecraft
This idea was stolen from magic gum's video
The guy in the jungle village sounds alot like me i got 50 diamonds on the first day of the smp I was in then got an elytra on day 3 of the smp but sadly cant play anymore since yea grades
damn dissed squid kid XD
Pwlebkatbaixyomfc
Why every League Of Legends kids hate over Genshin Impact💀🤦🏻‍♂️ Even they know the fact the Genshin is better and appears in 2020 🤣
This is really interesting, seeing people from various civilizations with their things and problems.    Seeing the jungle conflict is so interesting that initially it started as a dispute about the enchanment of a rebellious person who eventually became a powerful king and dictator who forced everyone to obey him.   Maybe this is what will happen if Indonesia is controlled by the PKI (Indonesian Communist Party).   But without thinking he just continued to attack the arctic until the desert to defeat because of numbers, if only he was with starkiller maybe jungle would win if without having to kill jungle people in minecraft it should be enough to  upgrade the gear of some members.     This is why a king must be chosen with care and must be a great man.  and when the arctic which was originally only peaceful was suddenly attacked and destroyed so but the most interesting thing was the arctic people who betrayed the desert.    Like a person who is proud of his nation and does not like other nations.   really teach a lesson that we should not be too soft and should consider everything.   And the desert actually didn't really benefit from the supply at first but the deserters could manage it well and there were no fights so everything went normally until it won itself.
it was heartbreaking to see arctic go down first and jungle be taken over 😭 star dying secured their lost fr
I last watched you when you had 20k been subbed since 10k
jungle
Timedeo!?
if only artic players won
More Pls :D
YOUR VOICE IS ANOYYING
omg squid kid
PRAISE THE ZOMBIE PRAISE
4:50 please... don't eat me..  Edit:oh.. just milk.. o k  Edit 2: 5:30 ok nvm.
I loved desert civilization the best. I love your videos  and I love your shapeshifting series as well.
I wistet the Arctic should have won Love your videos keep up the good work silver
Arctic deserve being killed because of betraying other nation
whatever happened to hypixel sky block
The king in the jungle is Rudeee
is that the Mario super bros 2 desert theme song
DO MORE OF THESE PLEASE
Give unique buffs and debuffs to each region
One of the best videos ever seen!!The best man silver you the best❤
This is great, I'll stick around for more of this content
JUNGLE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
I was rooting for the jungle nation, loved their energetic and war attitude, but congrats to desert nonetheless, and great vid!
Mentioning Genshin Impact got some of them killed xD
The first jungle players to die were the ones who didn't deserve it 😭
Christopher Columbus discovering America: 6:45
Wow l play genshin lmpact to and i leke your video
If i was here but im in 1.12 i will mine for 1h and try to make a castle
im at 21:47
Silver do more sivilization war i just subscribe to you
This video is copying magic gum, the thumbnail is basically the same, the players are spawning in different biomes, there are structures and natives that they have to overcome, and also the hunger thing  Edit: the king also gets a really good indestructible crown
That was insane
I was rooting for desert the entire time but Arctic was close second
i need the music
I just realized that there was genshin impact music in the background in 22:59. Btw it was my birthday when the video got out.
I've never met this guy Ize but I hate him.
Bro ize was king gorge
THIS WAS INSANE LMAOOOOOO THIS WAS SO FUCKING GOOD HOLY SHIT   THE JUNGLE BATTLE FOR KINGSHIP THE JUNGLE OFFENSE THE ARTIC GENERAL REVENGE PLOT THE BETRAYAL OF ARTIC GENERAL LMAOO
Magic gums video is better
yes do another civilization video this was very entertaining and enjoyable
arctic nice  dessert neutral also my favorite  jungle mean
2:27 wait a min why does he look familiar OH YEA ITS THAT POTATO GUY LOL
You make great content! Keep up the good work!
I Saw timedeo join
Stop bullying squid, he had enough with technoblade
I read the clickbait as race war
2x health, prot 5 crown, permanent strength, AND an elytra!? no one can escape, and since you are in the air technically, even while gliding with elytra, it always counts as a critical hit!
Someone should do this but in RLCraft
That zombie player vs Jungle king gave off Nezuko vs Daki vibes...  Zombie player is the MVP since it got the last kill.
so grg roblox?
STARKILLER WAS RIGHT!!!
this is fucking better than any fucking movie ive watched
jungle
The whole time I was rooting for squid kid knowing his backstory with technoblade.
DON'T WATCH THIS VIDEO IT'S A BLATANT RIP OFF.  Watch the original by MagicGum instead: 100 Players Simulate Civilization in Minecraft
Most entertaining minecraft vid I've seen in a while
Thank god this asshile jungle king perished, I meen dictator. If starkiller became the leader the jungle would have won
Dude what am I doing why haven't I subscribed yet this is a crazy changeling idk why only 10℅ people are subscribed
I sad jungle died. They had the most story.
he really did squidkid like that💀
Save time stamp 34:07
Very epic,  very creative.  And a decentt Amount of Complexity thx to the Roles and Events.   But i legit think we need more of both, to make the Fun explode. I think those Simulations  should be more ocmplex.
Jungle was so competitive so i like em
GO ABSTREKT! GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
I WANNA SEE ANOTHER ONE OF THESE
To me, this seemed realistic. Political killing and over throwing Revolution  Some leaders threatening others while other leaders didnt  War between sides  And more.   10/10 video
This video was amazing
why is this like an anime story 🤣
I’m glad desert kingdom won! Although Arctic was my favorite I’m glad they could join desert and defeat the jungle, at the beginning they were fine but after star died it sucked,the 9 people who were actually nice were literally forced to attack which was a stupid idea since the jungle had no idea what the Arctic had and only that they got the worst supply drop
u copied other people noob
copy
That panda just did a whole backflip O_O  23:15 at the left side of the screen
Great video!
Can i join?
jungle should have won
i really liked jungle kingdom but ize's dictatorship bassicly ruined everything,a nd I prefer starkiller most  a sequel would be interesting, if it was the same map then it would be crazy
Just if u want to know a minecraft day is 10 minutes so thats 50 minutes of increased damage of mobs and more mob spawning
"who made amongus?!" got me
Another one pls pls pls part 2 but like rise of kingdom
o7
stolen thumbnail lol
yo jungle was totally gonna win tho
i hate desert
17:00 what song is that it sound familiar
The king of the jungle region  piece of  crap reminds me of something
No offense but that was funny when he said squid kid was the second best potato farmer
Ize was the best ruler and definitely was not as bad that he made himself out to be.
Squid after watching this vid rn:😰
Im sad to see the loss of the jungle kingdom
10/10 my man is a god
maybe base the new civilzations off of the beginnings of actual civilizations ie china and egypt, and maybe we get industrialism and end off with a grand war or something idk
i dont like genshin impact that's why I watch minecraft videos
MAKE MORE NOW THIS IS THE GOOD SHIT -subscribed
Hey new you just got a new sub keep it up
I loved the artic just because of the song 😂
I wanted jungle to win
So glad the jungle king didn’t win and a big congratulations to the desert I knew when they had such a good civilization in good order they were gonna do great
Do this again
I liked jungle until they assasinated starkiller
I have ZERO respect for the leaders who backstabbed after offering truce.
artic should have won
This is why I tend to dislike watching these civilization videos cuz all it does to me is just highlight how bad humanity can be there's never any diplomacy or kindness in these videos and if there is it gets smothered by ruthless war leaders and at the end of each video all of the civilizations are dead because of war
Nice background music 👏👏👏👏👏 genshin player it is
umm can u ask a simulation? if u can.. can u pls simulate 100 players on a island? Edit : I cant download genshin impact on mobile  pls halp TwT
Necromancy always wins 🧟‍♂️
Dont forget about the Patriotic zombie guys HAHAHAHHA
LOVE HOW YOU ADDED GENSHIN ADVENTURE MUSIC : )
Jungle got a dictator and was a huge jerk
Silver man. You dissed squid kid hard
The guy in the jungle who was talking none stop about his gear he sucks and is a jerk
this trend is getting old
32:39 the general just committed a war crime
genshin backround sound effects
you should make this again but add marriage basics so you could have "children" which would be spectators (like the first player limit is 100 players) but the max players on the server would be like 200 players so only 100 players would begin while another 100 players would be stuck in spectator mode until they were randomly chosen to be "children" i think that would be interesting and be able to add to the player count
do another civilization video pls this was amazing
Arctic
He takes long to make the Vids but they are all bangers
finnally a calm youtuber
How do you make all of these things in your server?
To be honest, I was rooting for jungle until Ize, became too controlling, and the no mercy type. I then rooted for artic. Good vid!
“People lived in peace with each other.”  The LifeSteal SMP: Allow me to introduce myself.
i thought i was gonna hate this, I WANTED to hate this, autoplay played the video, immediately drew me in. now i want more. 100% awesome video would watch more
Second best potato farmer💀
2:22 very nice technoblade reference
I saw many youtubers in there :) (including preston, xNestorio, etc)
that vote was not what i would have chosen....
genshin is canon in this verse
so pretty much you copied the State
SEQUEL! THIS WAS AMAZING!
nerf miner
my fav was jungle they could win from the very start because of their territory and loot but they had bad teamwork they also targeted arctic first but dessert would have more loot due to mines the best option at that time was to target dessert
I was rooting for jungle
I like jungle op
25:22 betrayal 😢☹️😣😖😫😭🥺
abstract returned from the grave to finish the game as MVP
I hate IZE so much in this. Man needed to get offed day one.
y u copy the thumbnail from MagicGum?
9:08 "oh genshin impact hell yeah"
The first even t was harsh for the start
If this was on Netflix I would pay for it. Great video!
We need more
Smh the jungle was overly favored
“Second best potato farmer” You did that dirty lol
Plz more
sorry, second best potato farmer  iam whezzing
Is this a mod??
THATS NOT A TEPLS THATS A ZIGARAUT WHY DOES NO ONE KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE.
jungle king rude
Hey if you could please give credit to the original people who had this idea such as ish and Magic Gum. They worked hard on this idea much more than you did and I would like to see the original creators of this idea actually credited ✌
The jungle nation would of probably won if star was still king and never have been killed
Ngl man, wanted the desert village to win the entire time. The necromancy really convinced me they'd win and I was not disappointed
Hell ya i subscribe
Desert zombie player is the mvp of this video
i stopped watching this video when the sponser showed up
I love these type of videos! Please make a sequel!
Romans 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the Gospel for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes.
Cant lie i was cheering for artic
28:00 Omaha beach
Really awesome video
Ize was a prick, screw that guy
i didnt like the jungle
Bruh 18:00 he used one of the Mario songs
Why is squid kid in all of these?
Thanks
Hey man I saw that your thumbnail looks a lot like one of magic gum's
I hate this guy I've been subbed from 67 k but he just hops on trends and copies people no originality to his content and its just so boring I'm not hating it's just terrible
“THIS VIDEO IS SPONSORED BY GENSHIN IMPACT.” Me: *SPITS*
you can just hear the liyue battle music in the backround lol
nooo genshin impact
I believed in the desert :)
There was a lot of fucking mutiny in this shit right here
I liked jungle
You should do one with 1000 players or 200 players and all with different biomes because I really enjoy these
RIP Starkiller :'(
SEQUEL!!,
PLEASE MORE
What mod are you using for the miner, farmer, and warrior classes?
I disagree with the king election. #1 is snow, they easily had the most dedication. #2 is the desert because of that necromance. #3 is the jungle because they just put statues or monke and skulls... no dedication. ( AND THE SNOW HAS THE WORST SPAWN WITH THE JUNGLE AS BEST )
It was amazing!
i love how dessert put a grass block inside of the pyramid
The legend is finnaly back!
Second best potato farmer
Can I join the next civ sim?
ize is the worst king
ize would have been a good leader if he didnt act on impulse and didnt have people who were getting rizzed up by star like all star did was tell everyone they were doing amazing  if people werent constantly going against him, and actually relized that war was the only option in the end he wouldve won.
STARKILLER >>>>>>>>>>>> IZE
2:20 potato war reference     Potato war summed up is basically techno blade and squidkid battling over having the #1 most potatoes farmed in hypixel skyblock
I loved ize
Dude, hasn't MagicGum already done this?
the jungle turned into  directorship
Is this a pc only server or crossplay   cause I'd love to play but I don't know if I'd be allowed due to this reason
Noice
props for the genshin music
I love the Arctic
I loved the Arctic Kingdom, but I really wanted starkiller to lead jungle
artic the best
i wish to be in there
Nice job having a creative video
OMG HOW DID SQUID ESCAPE MY BASEMENT
wafflin
This was awesome. I'd like to see the next video in this series involve The Nether or The End!
Arctic should have actually taken advantage of their tunnel lol
This vid needs 1b views
Who else was thinking about the village attack scene from the force awakens when they jungle guys raided the tundra dudes
i wanted jungle to win so badly
The jungle one was EPIC
22:02 Childchomper AYO
I like the jungle
how dare u say im a squid kid is better then technoblade
Dang, I wanted Jungle to win
I like that when they destroyed the among us statue, they made it like an among us corpse
I hated Ize if starkiller was king Jungle would’ve lasted way longer Ize was too dumb and decided to bm when all of his army didn’t even have base Diamond gear
Not the genshin battle music in the background… I love it
I saw xNestorio?!
Genshin impact in the church is very accurate to the priest. IYKYK.
This is just a copy of another challenge bruh
I actually vomited when you said genshin impact
I hate that Ize
My favourite team was jungle because of how heated the politics was there
Their chances of survival would have increased for the artic people by building a wall
Everyone who jumped that liked Geshin Impact is now on my hitlist
Jungle king was literally a Barbarian. Only knew one tactic and that was attack  Well Deserved L
You stole the thumbnail from another video
Desert
Is this java or bedrock??
12 minutes in and there is already an assassination plot... I love it
i was waiting for my download for genshin impact till silver said the sponser
Let's go genshin impact
I was really rooting for the Arctic nation..  Such a shame they got shafted, but at least the Desert nation was good enough to take in the Artcic refugees
That beachhead landing was like DDay
Yeah I was going for the jungle at first, then they elected the king and he was cocky and mean
Rip star killer
Desert cheated
arctic
I already play Genshin lol
I liked all the teams. They all have different but great leadership and had interesting towns.
I enjoyed watching that
I liked the Donkey Kong music!
This was absolutely amazing to watch, the storytelling got me rooting for the desert kingdom and rooting against Ize. This was so entertaining to watch!
I was rooting for the desert since day 1 let's goooooooooo
i wanted deset to win from the start
I love the background Genshin music for Liyue btw your pronunciation is making many people mad, I am a Venti wimp.
Arcitic was the my favourite
Is the background music genshin themee
The ledgend Abrstrekt comes in and finishes jungle team
how do you do this stuff
War and peace
nice warden helmets
The Jungle Kingdom gave me huge Fire Nation vibes.
yes please give us a sequel to this masterpiece
Sequel this was so good btw the jungle king made it way better
I hate ize it should have been star🤬🎏
Make more of these please
can i write a story bases on this for  school? Pls, this is really good!
Gosh.
desert, because abstreckt the undead player had a huge role
No
Noo! not Genshin Impact!!
Part 2!!!!!!!! I want more
NO GENSHIN IMPACT
The genshin music in the background
Ize is toxic as hell hahaha
Pls make this a smp I really want to play on this
The jungle team was fun to watch.
I had hoped desert would win. Yay!
Jungle people should've took a defense role, and made archer towers in the trees.
Honestly, in the beginning i wanted the ice/snow kingdom to win. They just seemed like they were so happy, with good vibes, singing, a freaking dwarf fortress and even an ice rink! But then again, mabye Thats why they didnt win, they were too kind, and didnt start the wars. Oh well.
Watch yourself you almost said best farmer when we know who that is
the jungle nation made the same mistake as the germans in WW2 they didnt have a solid plan nor the numbers.
We really got a recreation of WW2.  A republic is overthrown by a dictator, who is focused on creating a giant military and slaying his enemies quick and fast. The first attack goes very well, and the dictator's enemies are destroyed with ease. However, things get harder for this nation as, they begin to lose equipment and people. And then in one final grand assault, that at first goes amazingly, they are then destroyed as they try a few more final chances to regain strength, only to lose miserably.
Bro put links to these on discord not everyone has Twitter you can put them in both
Desert deserved it, jungle really got on my nerves XD
I liked the arctic and jungle king team up that unfortunately led to their deaths
I liked the jungle civilization the most. I admire their devotion to their king and their military strength. Truly the most disciplined of all.
Jungle dudes carried the video
copied magic gum
bruh you just copied magic gums video picture and video idea
I like artic civilisation
The jungle was the germans in ww2
Get recked Squid kid
nice technoblade reference at the beginning
Man I was rooting for the jungle 😂😅
Its like a mini movie!
The snow biom won the election. Cuz they there the most friendly and funny and best looking village.
"and killed all the natives" is a phrase used a lot in these civilization videos (. _ .)
I like how first thing chungledor does is to fly up with his elytra ability
I liked the arctic the most.
Do you have a discord?
Please make another one of these videos, these are amazing
This played out quite literally as WW2, jungle being Germany, artic as France, and desert as Russia
I HAVE GENSIN IMPACT MY SISTER PLAYS IT
Jungle was going to win but they forgot the fact that they are still outnumbered, even though they were able to ambush the arctic civilization, they still left a few alive which warned the desert civilization which was increasing their military strength the entire time. Ize made a horrible mistake by attacking the arctic civilization and leaving the desert civilization alone, which was the reason of his downfall.
Very good video and idea it should be a part 2
In my opinion, the jungle kingdom is the best
That was insanly cool to watch, even for a stranger, your english is easy to understand ;)
Desert all the way
More
Was magic gum ok that you stole his title and thumbnail?
I wanted desert to win and now im happy
Let’s be honest ize was an asshole
If starkillers straggling members weren't wandering off in the distance then im sure the jungle kingdom wouldve won
The Mario music is what hits me
I like this kinda a thing civilizations thing especially in mc
can you do the applacations on discord too? I dont have twitter
Gg
Jungle should’ve WON!
abstract, the mighty zombie warrior carried.
they were laying it a bit thick with genshin impact but overall, it was really good and i could see the effort put into it
I'm always looking for youtubers who do this kind of stuff I can never find any
ahh yes squid kid #2 on the potato leader board
I’ve only cares about himself whereas star wanted to make everyone stronger
Sequel sequel sequel SQUEL SQUEL!!!!!!!
9:30
28:01 D-day be like
I did not like your video... I LOVED IT
It could have been better ngl
2:21 dammm
This was fwcking incredible!!! Loved it
Nerf miner
So good the video pls make video like this 😍♥️
Eyes was the villain of this story
This was good dude!
😂I like how he tried so hard to win them over while being a weirdo 4:20 "You guys im gonna elect myself leader"
Isn't Squid 3rd Best Potato Farmer now? I thought somebody dethroned Technoblade
I was rooting for the desert since the beginning
I wish I was aloud to use twitter
Yes
not just 100 regular people, these are TRUE gamers, who make living in minecraft a thing.
There wasn't any chance they could xray or cheat right? Kind of suspicious based on a few mining patterns
ize> any other player
I wanna see more like that like nether end and normls
Man I wish there were events like this on bedrock edition 🤣 Great video by the way!
The three civilizations were at peace, until the jungle nation attacked
Man how those people put more dedication to this test than any part of their school
PLZ MAKE MORE OF THIS WE WILL LOVE IT BUT MAKE MORE KINGDOM AND LITTLE LONGER
Tbh some people were jerks lol
That Ize guy was a tyrant, what a jerk, star would have made a good leader, there's more to being the leader than being strong and fighting, bettering the civilization is a priority too, and the ambush? What kind of crap was that? The people didn't wanna go, he shouldn't have threatened and forced them, I would have left the Jungle and gone to another civilization as a refugee
I would absolutley love to join one of these, they are super fun to watch.
easy dislike for trash content
Sorry no second best potato farmer
i don't know why but even tho they lose 90% of the time I'm arctic for life
You should make more of these contents! It's so good!
I liked the Artic team
I liked how he even added genshin impact soundtracks as it was his sponsor.
rise of kingdoms
Holy crap, this is amazing! I like jungle the most because they're so interesting.
The second he mentioned ‘Teyvat’, I was like, “Isn’t that from Genshin?” xd
This was literally so cool I hope you make another movie or a series!
Nice roast on squid kid LOLZ
Hol' up if I quickly do the math 100 players  3 biomes  100÷3≠ no equal ans  So either Silver's lying and there only 99 or 102 players  OR One team has 1 player more than the rest
I loved the ice civilization, they were so chill and being happy.
i REALLY INJOY THIS VIDEO PLS MAKE MORE
This is amazing 🤩
JUNGL
Wow I'm shocked, this is... amazing
Do this again but it is ww2 eara
I love it
Rok ads be like:
This video was amazing! I was team Jungle from the start, but after all of the brutality and backstabbing, I could no longer give my loyalty to such a nation.
killing other civilization players should give a boost of some kind, just camping on your civ is kind of broken, as you cant really use much of the resources you got from the civ you just kill.
The first time weve heard squid kid speak and its in a glorious sentance  "You make me sick you know that!?"
Even the among us character died
I was gonna comment a long paragraph but you actually linked the original idea which is nice because a lot of people don't
i was rootin for jungle D:
Thank you for the genshin special code!
I'd just dig a hole in the ground and hide
jungle
Three civilizations was a great idea because it gave us pretty easy things to focus on. I wonder if other win conditions could be negotiated though. It always ends with one civilization having to kill the other two, but what if there was a win condition that two civilizations could achieve? It would have to be a set goal that two or more nations could work on together, but treat it like civilization: there’s more than one way to win.
Shut uppppp about genshin impact
Hm it’s a good thing that I learned about the native Americans
Are you ever going to play hypixel again?
Pls make a part 2!
Thet were mayans not aztects
I love when he said second best  potato farmer for squid kid
36:41 Instant respect to that guy for being a red hot chili peppers fan
2:20 HAD NE LAUGHING
2:20 "so led by the best potato farmer in Minecraft, (im_a_squid_kid comes in) Wait no I read that wrong, the second-best potato farmer in Minecraft"   Flashes back to the potato war
I mean, the jungle king had a good approach, but was a massive jerk. Glad he died.
the jungle king annoying af tho
I hate the jungle king so much
Squid kid taking random Ls this long after lol
make more of these kind of videos this is my fav
I like the fact that genshin impact background music was playing
I knew that desert would win
can you do 100 days yours are really good
pls come back to skyblock speedsliver
I would love to see a sequel
Could u do bedrock
SPOILER       The video will end
more pls
liked the jungle they were strong
First i like the jungle now i see that they are bad
U should do this on bedrock
Loving the music frrom genshin. It suits perfectly with the situations where they are used
LETS GOOO DESSERT
When i heard genshin impact i was like:B   R   U   H...actually that looks so hard to make, keep going!
I'd love to do this
Great video but your thumbnail is very similar to another youtuber i saw and when are you doing the next one wish you get 5 milllion there are very few youtubers like you    Edit:the youtuber is magicgum
Awesome
I’m happy some of the jungle defied they’re king.
the liyue battle music lol
Jungel
Aww the plesure junglr losing
6:40   deja vu
BRO will you do another video of Civilization ?
Suiiiii
Silver the winter nation was so nice why kill three
Why was he second
Jump if you like fatherless impact
This is by far the BEST Minecraft civilization episode I have seen. Can you please make another episode but with different biomes
I liked jungle until they got the second leader
if you do this again make a event where people can respawn or get more people
silver talking about ganshin  me tried to installing it after i figured out that ur pc has to be at least 8 gb rams and my pc is 4 gb of rams sadly
The genshin fight theme fits the vedio  Time to redeem the code
ARCTIC STILL LIVES!
It felt like I'm watching a movie and it's great
Dude this video is fucking crazy!! I didn't step away from the screen the entire time holy crap!! Keep up the good work!
The jungle civilization was just chaotic
Arctic
#peace
this would have gone better if star was king
Omg this video is so amazing I’d be the luckiest person in the world to join it it must be sooo exiting!^^
scripted & rigged
I liked the jungle Village when starkiller was the leader but when the other guy became leader I really hated the jungle village
2:24       Has anyone noticed  I'm_a_squid_kid from the potato war?
Snow boys say strong rip, respect goes to these guys
This is copying magic gum watch his first video instead
Desert
all i can say is to do this again but with simple mods like more ores and different weapons and add a wizard class i think that would be AWESOME. also maybe an archer class where you get 1.5x extra bow damage and 1.5x extra bow range
i hate you for the fact that you don't know who squid_kid is
25:08 Wow I didn't know 1.19 retextured creepers to look like phantoms.
It's a true "karma backs"
22:08 is my favorite moment XD I couldn’t stop laughing
The last jungle guy is actually the best jungle player, he didint hesitate to go agaist a full geared 11 players
ngl eff5ive was a fucking bastard traitor
I was rooting for Arctic, sadly they were out first, I practically hated Ize for his blood thirsty strength, and was glad when I saw he had died and the Desert won.
BOOOOOOOOOOOORING
Jungle probably would have won if they retreated at a reasonable time in the second battle. they should have been more organized in the initial stages so they could make an organized retreat if necessary. They had the right idea though.
I was ruting for the artic tean
I wanna see more of this and this is amazing
jungle
When the jungle got to the beach it was like d-day lol.
SUBSCRIBERS
In the video u were showing u have 9m BUT U HAVE 1.75M MAN
This would be such a good server idea
The artic was the best
I loved jungle
We want a sequel :D
Finally a really good minecraft cilivazation vidoe!!!
I bet jungle leader is a 5.6 guys irl who doesnt get any attention and this is why hes so toxic, bruh
artic > desert > jungle
honestly moonlapse deserved that death when he ran face first into the ice temple that will teach em for being a greedy pig
Why at 17:09 is Zelda's Lullaby playing but desert?! 😆
Desert lets gooooo
again
I would really like to know how to join in these activities they sound like fun so do u have a discord that I need to join or something
The zombie was the true MVP imo
You didn't have to do squidkid dirty like that =).
Some one share this to techo blade
CAN I DOWNLOAD THE MAP AND IF I CAN WHERE CAN I DO IT?
Music fits with the sponsor LOL.
This was #1 on gaming
Remember japan didn't win the war
Jungle RIP :"(
The jungle clow... I mean "king" definitely seemed to be a dropped in the head at birth kid
PLEASE MAKE MORE MINECRAFT CIVILIZATION!
I liked the forest kingdom
this was really cool and the ammount of effort you put into this was crazy you NEED to do this again
i really liked the snow general he was not afraid and smart ggs
Jungle was best
anyone else noticed he used genshin music in the video?
Hi uhh can you send link to the origins i think that is what you used for farmers miners and warriors thanks!
I like the jungle the most
LETS GOOO ABSTRAKT
THISS IS SO COOLLL!!!!
Bro, this is genuinely one of the best Minecraft video and deserves way more credit!
desert deserved it
Well now I know what happened to speedsilver
Jungle nation is so cringe
Don't steal magicgums thumbnail
Damn... this looks fun wish I could have joined
Bro that music from genshin fits so much to this vid so good and interesing video :)
Honestly it’s better than the og
Amazing
bro u copied someone and didnt even mention their name
Make this a server forever
I an sad for star, if he lived he could have made a rebellion and killed Ize
Make part 2
why is the jungle king so toxic
i had genshin open while the vid was playing and i though i was being attacked by monsters in the game but no it was just the music in ur vid XD anyway good video keep making awesome videos like these man
this was so enticing
in 3:00 my disappoinment is... Just i know you need to gain money somwhow but... " Soap trusted you. I tought i could too. "
Imagine being a farmer the whole time, you provide food and have to sit around the rest of the game
The arctic
This is the most epic video i have ever seen!! U deserve a sub❤️❤️🎊🎊
You should probably add in a ocean or water civilization, I wonder how that would go. I would be very interested in that.
Im glad jungle lose but sad for the jungle member who got completely killed by the artics
You earned a sub, but next time try playing this yourself too. Will make more interesting vid.  Keep up good work
Desert
Dude your videos are so cool and interesting to watch. ☺
the jungle could have won, but the dude was in a hurry, so without taking a break he tried to take out 2 nations in a row that was his mistake
Where is the end credits this is a entire movie very good job
This was so good but it is like a clash of clans
I TOTALLY FORGOT SILVER USED TO PLAY UHC WITH SUEP HAHA
no hate but muliplayaaa
Your sound is great
Hey man i have a good news for you
2:47 😳
What happened to the artic
Do a part 2 pls :D
Amazing but really, genshin impact?
im gonna say something. fuck genshit impact
Nailed it bro..!
Love the video, I'm very glad you linked the original civilization makers in the description. Great youtube, I'm planning to watch you more!
If I played I would made a bunker of maze and lava traps only teammate would know right way
yo bro do the same thing but with the age of exile mod, that would be sick. btw this mod is data-driven so that means you can add things like gear and tweak anything you want via datapacks.
the jungle civilisation  like tecno blood for the blood god
i'm already 5 mins in i'm gonna like this
the sound i thoth i was playing gi hahaha
genshin is making me go crazy im too addicted to it that i tought i forgot I'm watching a Minecraft video lol i just hitted ar 51 yesterday
I was really sad when artic lost I was runing for them to win bcs they have the most controll of the village
Sir I am new on your channel I want to join your server how may I
Please more vedios like this
Dang dude this is insaine u got my like and sub!
silver how do people join you're servers and live activity
Can you make part two it was so entertaining
I loved 🌴🦧🎋
4:59 HE SACRAFICED HIMSELF FOR THE AFK PERSON... rest in peace
RIP Jungle
i can not imagine how long this took
starting to dislike the "what would happen if they were split into x countries" intro, it's been done enough so we pretty much know now lmao
You gave to much power to the jungle to be honest. I dont think that they deserved to by top tier in town building as is said its about to build your town and they litereli had 1 ape statue and some boring buildings. Ice nation had an Ice rink, Chapel at so.
Can you do more of this?!
eventho the dead played died and became a zombiefied abstrekt he still do tho honour of killing the last player of the jungle
i just realised that all of them were youtubers
Looks like we learned a valuable lesson here      Murder is always the answer
THE WAY HE CALLED OUT SQUID KID FOR BECOMING SECOND IN THE POTATO WAR I AM ABSOLUTELY DEAD
I fucking hate the king of jungle king i mean like he’s like the spoiled prince that doesnt know leadership and does something desperate and stupid to become king
squid kid never died, god potato kid just wanted to take him to a peacfull peace like the heavens
This video kept me entertained for 4 minutes  and 52 seconds
God loves you guys!
the second best potato farmer got me
i think jungle was the best that was my favorite
ok so desert figured out necromancy while jungle was having a revolution and arctic was partying
I like how silver plays genshin music throughout the video
desert was my fav from the start
This looks fun
Wasn’t silver at like 90k last year
I want more liked this 😭😭
u bloody copycat
Im assuming this video was inspired by MagicGum? Considering both the same idea, thumbnail and everything.
nice
Artic
2:21  #TECHNOBLADE
nice
artaic nation was my fav
i feel like jungle has the advantage cause they have so much space to plant
Phantom kills somebody silver be like he died to a creeper
multyplaaayer
This is so good
Video disliked
Artic is the most wholesome civilization they honestly deserve more
i hate the jungle most
desert are the best!!!
I like the jungle
🙃 subscribe
🙃 subscribe
🙃 subscribe
In my opinion Ice Civilization was cute, but the absolute monarchy of the jungle was much stronger in the fight because they all had to do as the king said, which made them more harmonious
🙃 subscribe
🙃 subscribe
The Arctic was so chill in the beginning they really got screwed over by the admins when that ravenger spawned  they were still my fav tho
Artic civilization built was the best and then dessert jungle was worst.
aw man arctic was so peaceful and so cool but they got the worst fate ever...
2nd best potato farmer xD
RIP THREE ARTIC NATION PEOPLE
Genshin impact is acctualy so fun to play thanks!! And I love your vids
do you think you could make a episode about 1000 Minecraft players battle siren head pleas??
8:30 That looks like my skin lol
I liked dessert
I like how the zombified abstract has became one of the most important members of the desert nation
I love the arctic civilisation so peaceful
I am never trusting an Irishman again😂🤣
Bruh sqiud got roasted
starkilleristhebestlikeifurstarkillergang
the artic its the coolest but is the weakest
Honestly If I'm the king here  I would recommend Increase Mining Schedules Increase food Resources  Build Automatic Farming systems Collect Mob drops or make a grinder for mobs especially for the blood moon And when the time had came.......  For the jungle who had the most power of all civilizations I recommend Release Martial law itself Aka 12 TNT jet dupers that will decimate other civilizations
love to see players in diffrent way build and fall  in thesse type of contents
I liked the desert tribe
woow i wish i participated :( i love people that put alot of effort into their content i watch Silver since 15k
That zombie had better pvp skills than me
silver you are the faster growing minecraft yt ive ever seen
Long live the desert empire
The Jungle kingdom fell from its grace. I rooted for their enemies the second Ize took power.
I can't stop laughing at the plot twist🤣🤣 just a random half revived desert member joining in the fight and being the one who kill the last player
"Led by the best potato farmer, wait. I read that wrong. SECOND best potato farmer," Emotional damage
The civilizations in a nutshell: Jungles: Bloodthirsty berserkers Snows: Ruthless Pretenders. Deserts: Pretty much the guys who are chill and are ruthless once pissed. (They also have the zombie)
Jungle kingdom had the best start
The fact that the zombie absterakt helped fighting the jungle kingdom is funny
The jungle amry turned to the nazi HAHAHA
Tbh im rooting for the desert kingdom from the start, they dont have woods they dont have animals they dont have basically kinda everything, and yeah im kinda expert with this "plot twist" stuff so.. Its predictable for me that desert win
Please make Videos more often Don’t be like Dream
Jungle was robbed :(
Insane!
29:44 It's simple. They praised their Supreme Leader Lord and Saviour Holy Spirit Genshin Impact. You, instead, were a normal group of people. Hell, there's even evidence of them possibly getting buffs if they sponsored genshin! At 40:05, Jack tried to get saved by worshipping Impact in hopes of getting armor, health or anything.
IZE SO BASED LMAOOO
Who knew wasting 30 mins traveling a husk by boat would have won them
Man, I wished starkiller would have been the king. A more peaceful civilization would have been born and instead of war, all of the civilizations could have joined together
Genshin impact=🗑️🤡
If any genshin players hear there’s genshin music was playing in the background
DESERT all the way
That is is fun but the size.
I though u were gonna say this video took a very long time  to make because it was hard to gather the players :|
Artic civilization were friendly and good builders.
this is already like a movie
zombie a king glory
zombie is a god
Congrats on getting a sponsor from Genshin Imapct ! xD (idk why but i feel like its a special event)
wait what desert won omg!
9:04 😳
"Oh, i mean SECOND best potato farmer" DAMN SILVER I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD BE SO CRUEL.
Any Genshin players hear that he was playing Genshin music during the video?
Abstrekt did all the work xD
Noo squid kid!
This is so well-made! Can't wait another videos like this
legit never watch minecraft videos but this was so compelling - amazing job!
why no reproduction eh
Banger vid. A lot better than most other civilization vids.
I would love a revenge arc of Ize WWOOOOOO
I GOT TO CLASSES, PAUSED  AND POGGED SO HARRRRDDDD
honesty eyes seems like an angry dictator who will kill anyone who disobeys, it seems like a good way to get himself assassinated.
I was going to subscribe but I already were
Ohhh cool
I can’t be the only one that is pissed off about the fact that a botw ripoff is getting more popular than botw but cool vid tho
i didn't want Izi to become king because he was getting greedy and arrogant
Hey you copied magic gum
dessert civilization was trash, so was artic, no wonder that suckers can too win in Minecraft wars
Ize and Saitama are the main villains
i hate the fact that you put genshin battle music here it made me feel anxious the whole time vhjsbfkesjekld
My favourite region is the desert
Please part 2
The genshin music in the background 💀 I was wondering where it came from then realized it was the video bruh  dendro slimes where you at??
The song give me memories
arctic
Desert
i like the jungle kindom although they didnt win and desert win but i dont mean i dont like them i just like green like trees.
I loved arctic ;(
Silver always makes such clean videos!
I knew that you were talented😃
Abstrekt is the side character that everyone loves.
i liked the snow the best
Make more minecraft civilization please this is a really good content thx for this content
The arctic's were the best. They so calm, peaceful and relaxing.
35:50 best use of zoom ever this is my fav guy
I liked the jungle civilization the most, just needed a better strategy against the desert civilization
Im sad when star killer died she is a good player im sad when he is not the leader she is good
Do you know if you pot me in The Desert I would survive because I literally live in the desert
Who else thinks this guy literally just copied MagicGum?
That Ize guy was really cocky
Is that private fearless oh wait it is
Yay the desert win
I love ice biom
IZE: LEEROY JENKINS!!! then get everyone killed 🤣🤣🤣
Dessert
Noooo why are u sponsoring forns gameeee
i liked artic nation
Please make server for Civilization bedrock cuz i play in bedrock and want to play MC Civilization
Post more like this I got my hole family to watch it :D
This video is amazing! Wish there was more of this content!
Jungle leader was to toxic
Its so sad that i dont have java and a pc
All the Genshin themes in the background tho😂😂😂
The Jungle has a ruthless leader
Look what you’ve done, you made squiddy boi sad
I liked the icey peps
Dessert
the genshin background music.
Ice end desert jungle was a nut
Jungle
Desert Is my freakin favorit
I knew desert would win cuz it's ma fave biome out of the three I forgot the other reasons
I JUST REALISED THIS VID WAS 40 MINUTESSSS
Make a modded minecraft civilization
I like The Most Is The Artic
37:48 that was the most comical death ong
the jungle king was so cocky and annyoing
Why dont you make skyblock videos anymore
Please make more this so good ✨🔥
I hate jungle king cause she is so rude like pucking beach
Yooooo i love it
I thought this video will be good but... 2:58
9:49 Ok then
my man started a new SMP earth
tbh I hate the jungle king, hes so rude, and I hate now artic for teaming up and betray, and love desert cuz theyre so kind and clutched up and they take care of that special zombie
Jungle      WAR
Ize is the most unlikeable person and was annoying as hell
susmas tree
he just roasted squid kid
I was kinda rooting for the jungle civilisation
Lmao zombified abstrekt was the MVP
TECNO IS THE #1 POTATO FARMER NEVER GET THAT WRONG AGAIN OR I UNSUBSCRIBE!!!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Ngl I would want to be jungle even though they lost
Wowowooo ❤️❤️
IMO jungle kingdom was the worse looking village winter was the best
Arctic best
Woman
the guy who brought the zombie and the zombie were mvps change my mind
im_a_squidkid 2nd place potato techno blade 1st place potato
I liked the desert kingdom, when you thought it was the end they made a comeback.
please do this again！！
boo
Yo i loved how the zombie got the past kill
The genshin music in the bg is amazing
I feel like Ize is gonna be a corrupt and power hungry king. Just as I say that- Jeez that dude was a literal dictator. Thank god he died. Also love how they hunted them down like nazi’s in WWII.
poor artic
We need more videos like this please
Desert Kingdom was the best
so much people are inspired by magicgum huh
Can u plss post two times in a month
the sound is genshin cool
How do you join things like this?
I prefered the Artic Civilisation
yes good genshin impact im ar 58
I was the one smiting them if you were wondering, sniping them from the heavens with my gun.
This was my favourite video keep up the good work! Definitely make a sequel to this.👍
Ur editing is just amazing man!
More bro plssss
I hate the jungle
i wouldv'e chose the worrior class and help the miners do their job  in the forest faction
23:16 panda flip
Can you play on ps4 on this game
This video is worth becoming an anime
Honestly Ize was a really good captain
Jungle was a good fighter But desert was a better defence
How can i join?
I can't stop dancing to that Liyue battle theme😭
The kings cockiness lead to their downfall of the jungle nation tbh
Here's what i can compare to each country (not to offense) Arctic civilization = Sweden or switzerland Desert civilization = Mexico or texas in america Jungle civilization = Probably Brazil
Please put Minecraft but there are custom mobs
Put Minecraft but there are custom mobs
Lol 2nd best potato farmer
Fama mina warir
Why this much late to put the video
Screw genshinimpact
how did your channel grow so fast
So magicgum started this trend I see
Jungle tried hard but they had to have mor planning
wow i am impressed with your imagination
Imagine if they all just fought then when the war came there was only one player in a region lol
This looks really fun

Great animations. I know how much work took that.
The desert was the best because they play team work
from a guy doing manhunt videos to littral social experiments its nice to see silver evolve so far out
This video is "SUS"
I REAAALLY LOVED THIS! Could you make a similar one?
I liked the jungle nation because of their drama and ruthlessness. They pretty accurately simulated human civilizations. They could have won if they had more loyalty to the king.
bruh the thumbnail is the exact same as magicgum wicch was posted 6 months ago BRUH
I wanna join your events but how??
i did not like the leader of the jungle kingdom but i liked the arctic they were so peaceful
So the Ottoman's Empire won XD
#stopyoutubescammers
I liked the Arctic so much
I wanted the dessert to win because jungle was rude
yo was infernally in here?
The sponser in this game video is also a game  😂😂
I really liked the sus Nation
We lost the Vikings! :(
The desserts are african 💀
This content is somehow portrays the ancient times of ruling, how the disputes solved, voting who deserves to be the king, etc. This is how the civilization works before. Thumbs up!
Man imagine if they replicate the world war 2
Noice do it again
The way that the skeleton turned 😭😭😭😭💀💀
I wanted the artic to win rip
Ize made the jungle bad it used to be my fav but that guy so annoying
Im sorry but in this i hated the jungle army, if they had done it right they could have made a deal with other nations and couldve wone via non violent war (taking away other nations supplies)
bro i hate the jungle
:(   I liked the arctic
Think jungle would have won if it just stopped for a second after the first invasion and did things smarter and if they were that bloodthirsty thirsty they should have performed a hit and run rather than a full invasion on the desert
the desert one because I liked the zombie
i loved arctic they were full of hope, i hated the jungle king ize tho
Best idea for these things is to choose a kingdom where you can get or grow resources and also keep the people in the area working together. In this video it would be between desert and arctic, if there is leaves in the desert than that is the one you should choose. This will force people to work together because of the lack of resources but just enough to sustain a kingdom. Also, having certain people in control of areas would be good for a government. Having a king that cannot make decisions without the voice of other higher ranking people is q good idea so the king cannot have ultimate power. Having a person over control of resources, farming, and looting would be good with a king thats actions reflect off of their decisions. I would also study the other videos to see what we need to prepare for such as a bunker for the blood moons, having storage for food. Using a buddy system that swaps duos every now and then would reduce the risks of traitors and loosing resources. Having someone who is battle smart and how to prioritize things would be a must in a kingdom
Desert of course
That jungle leader is so bad, I thought jungle is the best until that trick guy become the leader
:( I liked the snow civilisation
Silver is my mother
2:14 is that netherite pick?
I love jungle!
this is a masterpiece it really made my day better tysm <3
That Pyramid with eyes (40:29) it's trixyblox build.
i like the artic
Personally, I thought it was hilarious when a zombie, of all things, killed 2 kings without breaking a sweat, but maybe that's just me.
"hey guys, I'ma elect for king, that sound good?" "Uummm" "NO"
i liked the Jungle nation the most, they had a good but brutal leader.
The artic gang were mad nice.
I liked the desert and arctic civilizations and starkiller
Jungle civil is corrupt and arctic are best
Fools!  Everyone knows that TECHNOBLADE THE BLOOD GOD is in fact the best potato farmer ever.
Bro jungle was the worst not the people but the traitors and king
Idk but the leader of jungle is the people really like i want to assasinate
That was great I loved you should make more
Its like the lemings that one puzzle game
I know it's supposed to be a lighthearted thing that's meant for fun but I couldn't stop analyzing all the horrible moves the jungle people made. They're successful ambush on the Arctic was complete luck. They're leader was a bumbling idiot who's thirst for blood cost him the win. If he had taken his time and evaluated the location of the final battle, he could have spread the Desert forces with a part of his army that were posing as a scouting patrol. Once the Desert gives chase, you come in behind them and sweep the weak and slow, because the strong warriors are up front, and the more vulnerable are left behind. Also, rushing in was a massive mistake. They had no idea what the terrain looked like.          Ize's decision to move during the Blood Moon was also a massive mistake, but it worked out. He weakened his army, even by a little bit, and in this game, numbers mean so much. In real life, technology is the main difference in winning battles. Look at two of the Ottoman Empires. The Safavids and Mughals were destroyed by cocky and arrogant leaders who forced their subjects to follow their foolish commands. They also were known as the Gunpowder Empire because they focused so much on gaining materials for war they fell behind in every other aspect, leading to their ultimate demise.          Ize did win my respect after conquering the Arctic Nation, because it worked out for him. If he'd been a bit less lucky, he would have been killed and ridiculed by his people. However, because it worked, the opposite effect occurred. That still doesn't take away that he acted like he knew what he was doing when really, he was as clueless as a blind rat in a maze.
This is 🔥🔥 its like I am watching Game of Thrones BRAVO
I really would like to see more
LET'S GO ABSTRACT
I wanna be a part of this but I don’t have a Twitter account
I already know the Desert or maybe the arctic would won, because they're solid. No conflict unlike the jungle. But when the king election started we can see that the Arctic doesn't really have intention to win (maybe they doesn't really think that it would be that fast). Desert team sounds more mature tbh although there's only few clips of them talking. I still love the arctic vibes, i would join them even if i lose but the last Arctic player who betray even the dessert tho 😂 guess he know you need some content haha
It's the best thing
when I watched more, I heard some genshin music
What a very good job bro thats very cool
I liked he used genshin music Haha
Bro Arctic definitely won that town building contest, they had a great theme and vibe to their town
Ice all the way
I liked jungle but if I was that last guy I would search for desert people that did not like their king and form an alliance with them to build more people for the ambush
my fav was jungle
ize was a bad king
maybe an unpopular opinion, but man that ize guy was insufferable. its always the sweaty pvp-rs who make these events so predictable and frustrating to play in
Am a jungle team
PLEASE make another one of these, this was so fun to watch!
I like how he used the genshin impact OST for the video
Around 23:15 you guys that play Genshin , you can hear genshin fight music in the video
i liked arctic
That leader of the jungle was doing great but if it wasn’t for the desert actually being able to come together and strategize the jungle could have won
I want more
loved soup how he showed his loyalty to his own kingdom
funny you sponsored a game thats harrassing a youtuber which is tectone
29:37 the British are coming the British are ckmin
I honestly liked the dessert best just because the zombie, but the zombie really just helped out so much surprisingly.
Make civilization event video I love it and I'm new subscriber ❤️ love from india ❤️❤️❤️❤️😉
C,MON!!!!! THE Genshin Empact Sponsor Was SOOOOOO SMOOOOOOOTHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
“THE JUNGLE PEOPLE ARE COMING.” -from the scout. I don’t know I just wanted to say that.
Pls do more
I remember when Silver only had 1k he grew so fast I'm proud of him.
I'm impressed how well ize persuaded everyone to follow him.
His dig at im_a_squid_kid truly did put a smile on my face.
I’ve always wanted to be in one of these but I can never get in
Rip jungle
Bugs me how they made farm rught at entrance to cool fortress
bruh this looked like a kinda scam but this is so good ok not scam but like um idk
in my oppinon jungle was my favorite im a war type guy
Let us Press F to pay respects to the fallen Kingdom of the Frost.
Yeah, Desert nation deserved to win, the Jungle king was kinda of a dick
eyyyyyy genshin and civilisation, best video ever  edit: yeah jungle civilisation, genshin impact hail yeah  edit: yeah artic tribe!!!!!! genshin!!!! man i love artic, they r chill, especially active girl
damn tbh the arctic where my favorites if only they came back and killed the dessert people thats just tuff
I was rootinh for the desert members and the ending was unexpected. You gotta do part 2 about this with the same players or make an smp of this
Do
Arctic should have won
jungle should have won prove me wrong
silver ur like the most hard working Minecraft custom person I love ur vedios pls give me a shoutout in ur next video btw I liked and subbed and event thought desert won the jungle king was the most responsible
I have a gift for whoever is a warrior...  literally all the warriors: IM A WARRIOR IM A WARRIOR IM A WARRIOR IM A WARRIOR
Their king has bought their own downfall. They have every means necessary to build cobblestone regeneration walls, the foilage to hinder their foes, their time to grow in strength through unity while the snow and dessert stagnate.  They should have picked Star.
The worse was jungle  other 2 artic and  desert were goood
I honestly liked the ice plays the most  They had the most spirit
9:05 The moment I found out that this was all fake
Jungle King sucked, Should've let star be leader for morale support and such but ize or the new king be the general, leading the warriors while star helped with support more. next the second attacked suck. should've gotten more prepared
ARCTIC FOREVER!!!!!
Yeah the desert won against the evil jungle kingdom.
The arctic civilization is definitely my favourite
ITS A MEEEE MARRRIOOOOO!!!
My Phone Wont Fit Downloading Genshin Inpact :(
you are sow  good  i wish you are my brother 👍😊
Should do 200 players instead
Genshin banger music 👌
You are the reason I downloaded genshin impact the second you talked about coffee I knew it was a good game
14:51
The jungle is not powerful enough beacuase of their stupid king.
The jungle team could have one but I feel like some of those people didn't like being leaded so they wanted a king that let them do whatever
Also great job on this it’s very good the editing is great the animations are great you can really tell every second you put in this
the nostalgic mario music made me not listen to a single word u were saying
"have you ever heard of Genshin impact?" -JackTBC's last words
Ples make more this is so cool and idky why it gives me goosebumps, and this gave me alot of excitement about your next video :)
Do you have a discord if so what is the code because I want join
2:14 is no one gonna talk he placed diamond ore blocks to make it really realistic 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like how nobody noticed that the thumbnail looks very similar to Magic Gum's thumbnail on one of his videos.
Hey silver can you add some new item, armor and weapons but you did an awesome job and you really got cool video so you deserve a subscribe.👍👍
I liked the jungle kingdom the most cuz I like violence
*Who else thought of LegacyAN and Solesk* ?
nice
jungles leader ize was dumb he could have backed down for some time and allowed their team to get into diamond more they could have won. their artic ambush was a dumb play that worked out so he got confident that he can take out everyone
I liked jungle the most
I liked Arctic
11:24 my man don't care about anything and just focus mining but dessert civilization have necromancy
i like how he said 2nd best farmer
This has so many plot twists, at least jungle didn't win
That's zombie player is just like in the movie but I also like the jungle leader he is smart at talking but his one team betrayed him.
Why they have to do it to the artics😢😢
yo this video was hella fire, can't wait for more like this
that lil' zombie was really op dude
Is there any where else you can join because don’t have Twitter
Who is the best potato farmer tecnoblade or Mumbo jumbo the potato boy
love the music genshin in the background
litterly sees the genshin impact scene skips 10 seconds in a nano secod
wish 0% where not subed
"2nd best potato farmer" actually had me dying
How do you join these I looks like fun
You should try doing a movie plot in minecraft... For example try doing: The Lord of the Rings and have a few players attempt to traverse a terrain with the ring while assigning other players to be Elves, dwarves, men, orcs. And whoever gets the ring wins or something. Idk.
desert kingdom is a bunch of neckbeards lmaoo
Just me or is he full copying ish
Okay I see you scott getting sponsored 👀
This is the best 40 minutes of my life
do more of this shit
People said that star killer would be bad king but either eating carrots basically talking to everyone at least your safe you can mine and warriors protect farmers help get food so every jungle player should look at this and notice star killer should be the king eating won’t be bad you need food to survive and yeah.
i wanted jungle to win
So gud
Amazing vid keep up the good work!
Lesson of the video: Violence is never the answer
great job making this, really love it, especially with all of the great choices of roles and events you add
The mario music at the beginning was amazing 👏 🙌
I wanna see another Civilization video
I know it's gonna end eventually but I love this trend and I'm gonna cherish it while it lasts.
artic was the best
Amazing
He raely did Imasquid kid like that 2:20
This was so good Amazing content
Abstrekt or whatever his name was is the MVP 😂
Next episodes: I FORCEFULLY MAD 100 PLAYERS COMMUNISTS
My favorite person is the zombie he was so funny how he participated in the battle with the jungle players. 😂
I get that it's the point of the game but the deserts victory felt kinda cheap
Jungle
Don’t spend your diamonds on a hoe
Most of the people in the competition are the literal definition of 🤓
I was kinda rooting for the Arctic civilization ngl but this video was still so fun to watch and the ending was really unexpected.
22:19 they chose him for his voice 😂 he’s the perfect king voice idk why
This is so coollll
I'm making a mid video prediction. Jungle loses to desert because they killed starkiller.Starkville.  Edit:So it would seem I was correct for the exact reason I thought. The jungle went too early, and while they were able to decimate the weekend village, they also lost because the desert was ready for them. If they had listened to starkiller, they were on track to win.
U quit SB :(
do more of civilysations
;)
Jungle made a big mistake the should have chosen starkiller as their leader
the music from super mario wii threw me back lol
Wow☯️
Man squid kid really got trashed by silver
Rize of Kingdoms ad
This video is too long lmao
Personally, I liked the arctic kingdom most. Too bad they got eliminated first. :(
Best Minecraft civilization video yet
They Arctic was doing so well! Though after that they all got killed in an instant.
Here’s a idea for the next one every role is still the same but three more roles will be added but they a team limit here are the roles engineer, scientists and priest there can be two engineers 1 priest and 5 scientist the engineer can make morden stuff but they are expensive like cars guns helicopters and planes the priest can heal anybody on its team and give buffs the scientist can bring back the dead but also very expensive they can also modify weapons like acid damage and many others                             Edit: engineers can’t build tanks cause it will be unfair              Another edit: another role the demolition he does extra damage with explosives and can make bombs more quickly than other the engineer can make something called the sticky launcher for the demo so he can stick mines onto soft surfaces but if too laggy then no oh and there can only be 3 of them I tgink you should also add the adventure they can run and walk faster and can swing faster can carry more things then usually and loot is twice of the original one like 32 diamonds becomes 64. (Mining ores does not do it tho)
Tbh I don’t like ize
this was great! i loved the Arctic civilization!
A creeper caught him off guard.. BRO THAT WAS A PHANTOM
jungle got karma for killing artic and killing there own leader
bro when the zombie was released i was mind blown
THE ZOMBIE KILL AT THE END
i like the dessert kingdom
Isn't this just a stolen idea from Horizen?
Dang I was really rooting for jungle
This was a fantastic video. Keep it up! and yes i'd like to see a sequel
I dont play genshin impact my cousin those but i love robots and i dont play that game
I'm glad jungle lost.. they were awfull as a team
my vote was desert, arctic, THEN jungle
do this again but with 500 people and make the server worldwide!
My fav civilization was by far the Ice Kingdom, unfortunately the unluckiest one. In second place, the Desert one that showed how thinking before acting can leads anyone to victory. In last and DESERVED place, the Jungle: THEY HAD A COUP D'ETAT FOR NO REASON BESIDES "UH I HAVE BETTER GEAR AND GAVE U THIS E'TABLE NOW I'M THE KING" LIKE MAN WHAT????????? I wish they had last place tbh >:( I wish starkiller was alive to give glory to his nation
props to ize for getting off on all the one-sided pvp, but a good general directs instead of charging in to get a million kills.  that being said, real leadership is boring and the thing about minecraft is that none of your achievements really matter, so ngl that’s probably what i’d have done.
Bro sorry ain’t enough for the Ravager
yes, these videos are great
I still have a lot of respect for this man on hypixel skyblock, man got me in to it and helped me so much with his videos but also i have respect of his insane growth outside of hypixel!!!
ngl im a pvper so im on team jungle
I’m playing Genshin impact while I’m commenting
I hated the cocky Jungle king so much happy to see him eliminated, also nice job on the video it was amazing!
Me:Installed Genshin My Phone:died*
I feel sorry for squid, techno ruined his life lol
thx for the genshin code🙏🏾
This is now my 10th account subbed to you
I think the idea of a squid holding up a crossbow to god is a funny image
JackTBC’s last words:Have you ever heard of genshin impact?

BRO AWESOME?!
I can imagine this like a series. We NEED more of this
Just had to go and violate squid kid like that
karma is ruthless
這個很好看 繼續拍下去！
When the sponsor is genshin impact:
Wholesome ending👌
Why none of them build a bigg wall
Extreme hunger event happens  Guy : has a cow
artic and desert my fave artic had so much spirit and desert was very very organized I liked both of them and I don't like how jungle trash-talked Starkiller he had more leader ship then anyone there
Video Suggestion: Do the same thing you just did, but it's NETHER themed. 2 Civilizations, a Warped Forest one and a Crimson  Forest one.
I like the arctic
R.I.P Arctic 💙❄️
JUNGLE NATION
The giant temple at the end was made by this guy, https://www.youtube.com/c/TrixyBlox
Plz make another one
omg i loved the back ground genshin music im pretty sure it was from liyue it was a good vid
"WOOOO I CAN FEEL MY POWA" - random player
Ize is just the guy who wants to win
0:09 ...?
I think the guy who left the group and tried to join arctic was pretty stupid you literally just killed their clan of course they're gonna attack ya
they all said they like genshin impact... if you know you know
Jungle was the best they were ruthless and persevered
jungle is the best but the leader is so so he didt make his fellows to gather diamonds
25:20 betrayal...
I know your prob not going to see this and if you do, respond. But I was wondering if there was a way to get into one of these without Twitter?  Like Discord or something.
jungle kingdom virgin confirmed
2:24 ya techno is best potato farmer
i was hoping desert would win
I see this guy was raised by the wii and wii u and I was used to the nsmb u music but once I heard that donkeykong country returns overworld theme I shed a  tear on the food I was eating
I love the new super Mario bros wii background music
Jungle kingdom has committed crimes against panda kind
25:05 That's one WEIRD looking creeper!
I knew it every time desert undoubtedly wins
The most potatoes farmed is technoblade
I want more
I think the jungle king will win cuz they have the bravery and courage of death the rest of didnt go was DEAD
I thought the artics base was the best looking
I was ruthing for jungle
The second best potato line about Squid was hilarious! Love how you went ‘best potato farme- I mean, *second* .’
Soup was an outstanding and clever general.
I found technoblade's enemy squid kid 2:23 go in slow motion 0.25x
ize got merked RIP BOZO🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The desert I was voting for them And if I was the jungle I would’ve immediately left them
Great play
Make more civilization videos pls. They are epic!
Jungle
do it again but with only minecraft youtubers
the jungle civilization was ubicated on mexico azteca is one of my country cultures the temple is a reference to the chichen itza one of the 7 wonders of the world
The jungle kingdom
The leader of the jungle nation ize was kinda mean and annoying
Dessert won bc s Jungle, ruthless and raiding without knowing that others had more players and always arguing. Artic didn’t much have much of a plan and just building fun stuff and playing instead of gearing more up. Dessert, gearing and making there civilization stronger was a efficient way of winning and all dessert was royal. Leading to a win
That was awesome well done
You did not just call squid kid out
PART TWO!!!!
izs is such a be ach
Genshin is very good ppl i play it from the start... btw the geshin music u use in video is pogg didnt expect that
Was it just me who found ize so irritating? Man just kept acting like a spoiled manchild lmao, especially when he tried to kill his teammate just because he told ize not to continue with the invasion because of less numbers. In my opinion the other guy shouldve been leader even though he was rambling alot but aye it iz wud it iz
Abstrakt zombie carry
If i'm gonna be honest the arctic had the best looking houses and the jungle the least. I'd personally flip the loop drop tier
I feel like the jungle could of won if it wasn’t for the attack of the desert
I was hoping the jungle kingdom would win, the first time I ever rioted for the militarists
the way you roasted squid kid damn
That donkey kong music in jungle hits different
so good make  2second one
man star is a beter leder
build comp is rigged 😭
Jungle
I like jungle :(
lets go dessert
I am hooked
The music slaps
I've got an idea you could do a civilization type of thing but its with ancient grease with Sparta and Athens and etc
The only mine craft person I like
2:22 lmao
I LOVE  THESE VIDS THANKS SILVER

Omg please make more videos like this I love it !!!!!
This was epic!
7:37 guy is using no slow down hack
2:23 you really did squid kid like that
I love Genshin Impact
Video was amazing, except genshine impact, 6/10
I wanted jungle to win
Lemme grab my popcorn, this vid is gonna be epic!
I liked the artic empire and ruled for them
Will it work on ps2
yeah more rpg than life try doing this 5 spawn points 1 in the middle and the others in the 4 corners and let them loose 5 artifacts fighter farmer miner all in 3 points in the world
Yes
I liked the Arctic Nation the best, their civilization seemed so peaceful, luxurious and happy
kind of copying content for views, but still good
idea: make civilization simulate on origin mod
To all star wars fans: doesn't it make sense that starkiller was the jungle leader
I want to see more!
yall worshipping genshin forgetting that theres an npc whos a literal p ə do, he səxu ª lized a 12 year old (and i think a 9 year old one too) while making a fangroup for more p ə dos 🥰 have fun knowing yall worship that
Yo made fun of squid lol
I love this Please continue civilization Minecraft.
Ngl the sub glitch is real I was unsubbed even though I didn’t do anything and almost missed this vid
Starkiller was the true king💔
Lmaoooo all of the junglers were jumping for genshin 🤣
snow favorite
Omg im a squid kid
Artic is best!
I'm so happy that the desert won i got annoyed by the jungle although they were the most entertaining kinda wish suep won tho coz he tried to win for his team
Potato war reference
I wish that the jungle Nation would have won but I would say the jungle nation was my favorite
I really like the Idea of that Civilization Setting. It would be cool if there would be more classes like Lumberjack (get more wood than normal), Brewer(which can brew powerfull Potions and even upgrade them), The Miner (gets more ore out of blocks), Smith (gets more ingots out of ores). Maybe a Archer Class (deals more damage with arrrows and can craft some kind of special arrows) But these are just some ideas.
i liked the Jungle civilization so much, F for are junge warriors that dyed (all) F
i liked the jungle kingdom they were very strategized especially the king because yeah the old king was assassinated and the cow   the cow is better
Are i see only see at start on blood moon players was 69
Lets appreciate how much effort and work Silver puts in his videos
The Arctic civilisation was the best!

If the jungle king didn't show too much confidence he would have won
I honestly DESPISE the ones of Jungle kingdom, like the king. I know it’s a game, but god dang, people like that dont deserve what they got.  This is why I was banned from Netflix.
i really enjoyed this , thank you for making this
Aww, I was cheering for the jungle!
Amazing
Idk y but genshin impact soundtrack fits Minecraft so well
THE FACT THAT HE ROASTED SQUID KID 😂😂😂 I AM DYING 😂😂😂
Aw man I was kinda rooting for the Jungle Team also.
i liked jungle.

The desert nation was the coolest
we want more.
35:50 “gosh”
Waiting until someone decides to do communism in the server
I need more silver!
Or the desert (the region that won) advanced more and went to the nether meeting the crimson warped and waste/original nether and they go into the overworld wreaking havoc
Everyone is against the Arctic  I don’t like it.
Silver… I’m very proud of you… TECHNOBLADE- THE ULTIMATE POTATO FARMER

Star killer is like the good nice guy who dies in a horror movie
The jungle leader ize was just hungry for power wanting the Arctic castle
Imagine if technoblade was on Arctics or Jungle team who would've won?
Ok, but what does an army of Mandalorians from the thumbnail wants from poor villagers? I thought they were supposed to protect them from raiders.
What’s the server? I am interested in being in a video 😃
25:07 Infernally caught lacking
Arctic was by far my favorite

Desert was worst
How do u make a sever
The desert only won because they were the last to be attacked and had more time to gear 😂
Ohhhh yea Mario Forever music
Jungle should have waited until blood moon was over so all their members wouldn’t have died and also have groups in the attack of the desert
this was so sick
you advertised the ad so well i might start playing
I always liked the jungle kingdom but without their king they wouldnt last a minute
I love this. Pls do more this type of videos
I am watching you from you were on  10k keep growing dude 🙂🙌
This was the most amazing thing ive ever fucking seen

Gotta love the mario music

All hail starkiller, sir if you are reading this, I respect you with all my heart, salute and god speed
You did not have to do squid kid like that man 😭
I love how he makes a jab at squid kid calling him the 2ND best potato farmer. Oof
2:20  Technoblade : so u have chosen death
Bruh they really assassinated star
Please do other civilation videos they are so cool
When is your next vid btw do you randomly select people into your videos
Desert forever!
Sequal pls
Hi
Amazing
LETS GOO OMG THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN
Snow nationn for life they were so festive
famous last words: have you ever heard of genshin impact?
Those 40 minutes were worth it
how do you enter these
Ayo got popcorn to watch the video
brooo r u speedsilver? the guy who did skyblock vids
finally the first person to get sponsored by genshin impact
Awesome video! Keep it up.
Rise of kingdoms
First I routed for the jungle nation, but after the change of command I just wanted them to die
1:46 do i see INFERNALLY?? the first double rainbow prestige on Hypixel??
Ize has hitler vibes
Rip starkiller he vas a Nice gay he did not  needed to die
Ay I thought jungle would win (:
"ARE 3 INNOCENT LIVES JUST CONTENT TO YOU?!!!" No, it's GOOD content.
so good!!!
LMAOAOAO I LAUGHED SO HARD WHEN I GOT THE @ND BEST REFERENCE NOOO 💀
Squid kid is trying to take technos best potato farmer title
WW2 simulation be like
I was rooting for arctic
PART 2!!!!
These are some amazing edits man, keep up the good work!
The jungle nation could of won if they had better gear and did not split up
I cant download genshin impact
When you want to be in a video, but you don’t have twitter or minecraft…
Jungle would have win if star killer not killed and betrayed
How do i play with you in games like these? I only have bedrock, but i am trying to save up to buy a gaming computer, then i will buy java. do i have to join a discord or something?
Did anybody else  see techno  name 😂
Jungle is best
ironic that the zombie of a dead guy who was one of the first to die was the sole reason why desert won
Dude this was awesome! All your hardwork paid off!
Jungle was the best and strongest shame they didn't win
The jungles were evil, and they paid for it.  The Arctic were untrustworthy, and they paid for it.  The Deserts were honored, patriotic, respectful, and trustworthy, so they got paid for it.
Jungle
Please meke part 2
U stole a thumbnail but who cares this is good
jungles my favorite
I hate the voted jungle king ,star killer would be a great king
I have a question do you need Java
i was rooting for the arctic sad they didn’t win and more of this would be fun to watch
Finally, A Great Video to Spend time with!
2:16 it looks like he broke then placed the diamonds
total 100% original content totaly
The Sponsor *GENSHIN IMPACT..* makes me wanna -play it- *OOF*
Good job desert artic you goes are traitors
do you know about a public server what is exactly like this?
Jungle
The thumbnail is a bit racist ngl
2:21 “Lead by the best potato farmer” *Looks at squid kid* “I mean… 2nd best potato farmer in Minecraft”
The tree guy who die because there is a ravager
Someone should give abstrekt a medal for joining in and ending the war from his grave
second best XD
This take many days to make lovely keep it up 😘😘😘😘
Jo why did you guys made Dead people or Zombies so they cant be hited
Oh hell naw they sponsored genshin impact 💀
#1 best potato farmer :technoblade: bruh
"So the best potatoe farmer... never mind I read that wrong" reference to potatoe wars
I like how silver put  a reference to squid kid losing the potato war against a pvp pig
Part 2 pls
this concept has been milked so hard yet its still fun to watch
Ize is just fing stupid like imma kill dis guy for watching out for their group members like what leadership is that
This looks so much fun to play in
bro i want u to make surviving 100 days in the end as a shapeshifter with more custom shapeshifts and mobs
I love the jungle tribe
Desert just Cleaned
"until the fire nation attacked.."
Guess you could say Ize followed the law of the jungle
you can just tell suep used to play uhc.
Can u make another one of these?
man post skyblock again :(
among us?!?
17:22 how did one of them become a Husk there isn’t a necromancer class is there
Wow! Its very cool! It inspired to make some kind of map like this
My favorite is snow and Sand
add a necromencer
xD i love how he's using genshin music
I preferred the desert because they won and they had a good leader and were kind to each other. I like the jungle at first but until the let ive be the king I hated them especially ive being mean and killing his own allies. The artic weren't as bad but the still betrayed the desert.
Arctic
Do a Poland , German and Russian civilizacion of ww2 please🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
9:06  *”Oh Geneshin impact Hell yea babyyyyy”* i cant-
Haha second best potato farmer
To be honest the two things that would help is a quick start and being able to beat one of the three civilizations so you then get all the loot in that civilization
More with 5 civiliation
So cool
State smp v2
i dont wanna see a fckin sequel i want a fckin 50 episode serie of this amazin ass content

Part 2 PLZ we need it!!!
GoOd
MAKE MORE VIDS LIKE THIS PLS
Respect for that zombie
I like this
Jungle worst
2:41 I'd just log out till the event ended.
I love how the jungle King was blaming all of their problems on the players instead of his own faults
Jungle
" oh genshin impact hell yeah baby "
face reveil
Just realized who the best potato farmer is. It's probably acookiegod and looks like Silver kept that in mind.
“Technoblade joined the game” Everything then went terribly wrong
desert baby
That roast on squid kid XD
YES DESSERT WONNNNN
Desert
jungle's king got too cocky and abandonned his own team- "dont like run away" "dont get scared and run away, were going in and were going in thats it" -that same king who ran from the desert army
Also a civil war are people who live in land that is there nation fighting for land
I like the necromancy of desert so I like desert
I feel like thats how world war two went down...
I liked the Arctic Nation the most!
1000
pls seaquil
I see you are joining the trend,little bit late but you are here anyway
i liked the desert kingdom and i hated that warmonger jungle king guy so annoyoing
MAKE MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS
desert civilisation was best
god, soup would just have wholeheartedly joined desert and since they merged with them, if desert wins they also win and with that he had avenged his teammates.
I loved jungle
People in the jungle place are now natives
The only mistake jungle did was attacking desert just after invading artic
im playing genshin while watching
opao[jspofshigahpojaspoJ WHY GENSHNG IMPACT 2.5
Once I came to the elect thingy I said this was going to be a Monarchy because you said king. DONT LET IT BE A DICTATORSHIP EVER

I want part 2
It was soo fun to watch and I wana play a game like that
I like how the zombified abstract has became one of the most important members of the desert nation
genshin impact more like pedo bait
I feel like if star became king and lived peace could’ve been maintained for a while and prevented war that destroyed them selfs
😡😡😡😡😡😠

download genshin impactt
I don’t like jungle king he’s to crazy, he’s syco
More more more more!!!!
well the arctic civilization for me is better than jungle xd but they are 3rd place rip 3 players

my opinion about the builder contest is that artic should have won. their details was much better!
Technoblade is top 1st

The jungle guy that had green text that was in the desert was the pure idiot who was listening to star killer LOL L + ratio
ZSPDKSC3V8V5

If dead bodies mod was added there
General and the artic soldiers, the desert people, and starkiller are the only likable characters
Desert kingdom
The music is just 🔥
is it bedrock as well?
Im glad jungle lost, ize was crazy and a horrible leader, he only won again arctic because they weren't really taking things very seriously
Abstract got them the win even in death
Nice server
I think I liked the Arctic Town Center because it was really cheerful and happy, until the ravager
enjoying minecraft with genshin ads and theme what more do you want
I was ltry like hope desert wins  it happend yooo
Dude I was shouting when the jungle leader died bc he was kinda toxic I like him at first but then he became toxic
How can i join please?
"These aren't People!"  "A huge conflict with the natives..."  Poor choice of words there
I liked the Desert Kingdom
The desert is just chilling half the video
I like the arctic
I wanted snow to win :c
30:45 HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
Do you know if I can join your next challenge?
Mine was jungle
Chungeldor kinda sounds like WilburSoot ngl
The dessert kingdom  and the artic kingdom won and thats not fair for the jungle
At the start I was liking the artic civilization because they had good communication and their civilization has been growing little by little. But when they betrayed the desert civilization I was disappointed and was on the desert civilization's side. I'm happy they won with a member they got from the undead :>
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I liked the jungle civilization most !
I was rooting for Desert
bro the jungle civilization king sucks bruh
Th is squid kid doing here
Might just be me, but Ize was way too annoying. Sure, he had gear and took out the Arctic. But he literally did nothing to be a good leader except threaten to kill his fellows. I would have told him to kill me then and burned my gear so he didn’t get it.
If you think about it the dude in 5:00 actually saved the afk dude from blowing up.
Imagine See Your Dead Self Save Your Nation
My favorite character was suep
nice!
L Jungle L
Rise of kingdom ads:
I know squid kid he won me beasts challenge
Do more of these Silver this is very entertaining
Is no one going to point out the TECHNOBLADE REFERENCE with the potato war
Yes
jungle
yae miko, shougun, kokomi are bad
Make ussr
I’m a og of your Channel but I made a new account I’m back and happy to see you have got a million subs
Abstrekt carried the desert nation
Do this again, but instead of Jungle, Desert, and Arctic, it's Overworld, Nether, and End dimension. With the origins mod to make it more viable.
i feel like jungle would win if star was king
The zombie should have been the desert king XD He was so op
IM SO MAD PLEASE DO SEQUEL BUT DO THE WINNING TEAM A DISADVANTAGE (if you keep the same players
I was rooting for desert
i like jungle until they wanted war so i started to like desert bc of team work
I like to die that one
genshin impact battle music just there on the backround
just love the fact that some kingdoms workship a chinese game.
30:45 epic moment 😆😆
LETS GO DESERT
liked desert kingdome they were the most charismatic and had the least chance of survival
I liked arctic the most 😭
from the beginning I rooted for the desert kingdom. Their Partnership and almost no fighting made me instantly know they were the strongest.  but of course you always gotta have that one guy in every kingdom which never works out but none the less made it all fun to watch.
you ripped off magicgum's idea for his video's with H E A V Y I N S P A R A T I O N
The jungle kingdom honestly could’ve won if they had actually taken the time to strategize instead of just rushing in blindly :/
It kind I  pissed me off that he fucking gave the most war driven nation the best loot and the least war driven the worst loot I guess he prefers content and views  over fairness
Funny how desert had zombie teammate
Tbh, I wanted desert to win. They had a rlly good leader and wiped out artic with barely a loss.
Awww so close
It’s a jungle but I guess the dancer did have a zombie on its side and I love that so I guess I am rooting for the desert now yeah
I love your video I'm new and I subscribed to you
You should change your name to "Sliver" to see if people notice
We want part two
I just realized Infernally was part of the Desert Civilization
man really hit squid kid within the first 3 minutes.
you grew soo much i didnt watch for a week and then you alr got to 1m subs
Make a civilization video but make it futuristic
what this 2:16
The Election should've went much smoother for the Jungle Kingdom. You had 2 leaders yes, one should've been over the military forces and the other should've been over economy/resources.
Who found out the music in the Inazuma region of genshin impact is playing? (Near the 22-minute mark)
25:20 Respect to Star Killer! :(
I like the dude that said OH GENSHIN IMPACT HELL YEAH BABY
I knew that desert will win
jungle
Jungle leader is bad at leading bruh.
and pleease do not kill me and go easy on me because im really bad at minecraft
Yes this was amazing
zombie woriior XD
plz upload more civilaization vids . love ya <3
the dead crewmate got me
Your so bad
Seriously he’s literally useing Mario theme music
Plz make another video like this
The part where you said the second best potato farmer got me
5 Civilization Challenge: End: Use Better End Air: Mountain Peaks, and Custom Clouds Land: All Climates, including Rivers Sea: Only Ocean-Class Biomes Nether: Use Better Nether  Server: Origins, Origins: Classes, Mob Origins, Extra Origins
Honestly i liked the jungle from the start
Water what now?

The fact you used genshin music on some parts of the vids just makes me so happy because im a genshin player and i lobe your videos

Pls make a second part

Abstrekt for the win
Ize is the most annoying guy ever
I was hoping jungle was going to win but they were close
I liked the desert civilization and the Arctic civilization
How do i join these kind of events
I was rooting for jungle but then it became a dictatorship
That zombie is loyal to his nasion even after he become a zombie
Finally a new video I love your video kip it up 😘😘😘😘
Well, THAT WAS ENTERTAINING PLZ MAKE ANOTHER ONE O SUBCRIBED AND LIKED

Desert kingdom is the only civilization that didn't backstab anyone
Dragoon is the best potato farmer😀
Can I partake in one of These
If you guys are using mods u should try the tetra mod since it gives a lot of freedom what you want to make
2:21 "lead by the best potato farmer" *judges in technoblade* "wait i read that wrong the 2ND best potato farmer" *un-judges in technoblade*
Bro "starkiller wouldn't do this" 🤓🤓🤓🤓
the jungles fought hard
Let’s go techno
I need another one of these videos
I like that he used super mario wii music in different biomes 🙂
Go desertttttt
Juilging
I woudve wanted 10 miners & Farmers and everyone else is a Warrior
I really am happy that the dessert army won
That was epic
Pog
how the mighty have fallen
I'm proud of you man I ve been there since 2k🙂
Hope that there is a contuniation of this its just too good to be over hahaha
Booo,jungle!Boooooooo!
This was cool as hell
The Jungle Kingdom Couldve won if they Planed an ambush Where There split in To 3 Groups 1 small group waiting at Their base as a Distraction and The other 2 waiting left and Right  as The Dessert kingdom Goes to Their base for an attack The 2 Groups wuld Wait flr The Dessert groups ppwerfull men to go First like they  always do The  ambush the weakest ones at the Back slowly killing about 5 of them then the all of the Jungle kindoms group reunite to Finnish them off
DESSERT
I’ve been watching since 13k subs andI used to be so angry when other YouTubers copied you because you were small. Now it makes me sad to watch you copying others 😞
4 teams would make it so the group not attacked wouldn’t win by 10 players as it’d start with a 2v2 and there would be even starting civilization size, maybe an ocean civilization for the 4th one if you do this again
i love the ice kingdom because the among us statue
Did u use genshin impact theme song?
I hate the fuxing jungle kings He is fuxing making look like fuxing real king
jungle i liked im angry
If u could possibly get trchnoblade to play than that would be chaos
i was kinda sad when the arctic got ambushed
Its by my advice🇵🇭
3 Climate Survival: • Arctic Tundra: Vast expanse of ice and frozen oceans, barely any hills/mountains. Good for fishing, but that's about it. • Tropic Archipelago: Dense volcanic jungles that are home to many animals. Be careful for ravines with excessive lava. • Arid Desert: Large continent of sands and Mesas. Lots of mobs, but large amounts of ore deposits
But still the ice are intelligent if the set up enough traps and did not panic they can escape and they didn't try to team up with the sand like the jungle and panda village did
YESSS DESERT WON WOAHHH!!!! PEACE NEVER DIE!!
Desert
Jungle was just Germany in ww2
Jungle
the way ize screamed for soup and he was just like "i gotchu man, get in the cave" after all the war just gave me chills oml.
Also keep up the good work dude you deserve more then a millon subs hopefully you get 99m subs I mean cmon guys he deserve subs so give him subs and I hope you have a good year
Antirct is the MY favoret
someone promote that zombie to desert co leader
I love the music because it's from genshin and also gl on kokomi or ei if your pulling for them! And I said that because I got ganyu and keqing on a one draw anyways gl on your draws!
i was hoping jungle won till starkiller  got backstabed
I like the. Desert
the jungle civilization
i liked eyes and his army! GO JUNGEL!
I play genshin
Bruh they copied MagicGum, the thumbnail is just a worse version of magicgum's, the introduction is basicly the same, and the title is the same other then the "I made" part.
I like how the desert zombie kill the last jungle guy XD
I like tge Dessert Civilizations even though the biome is hard but in the end they won...but it's mostly because of the Zombie Warrior XD.
I love these
I hate jungle but i like artic
i hate ize, but i'm realising he made this like a fucking movie, cuz he was like a corrupt general who became leader. He had selfish and greedy methods and he had beaten a kind and thoughtful leader. then our protagonist, the desert people, killed him and completed the arc making a perfect story.
I like how the desert is falling behind at the start but they still won the war at the last.
arctic for the win
Jungle made a terrible mistake electing that leader if they had never elected him and choose the other guy then they probably wouldn’t have been in this mess
21:15 "Content"
squid kid is right you killing 3 people for contentent its just wrong
i absolutely hate people like ize. so selfish
This is really what happened with history
my man at 4:57 basically stopped the creeper from blowing up two other players that were occupied.  Don't know why he didn't just hit it away, but still he saved some people.
Currently cows in Minecraft de spawn after noone is watching
The fact that he referenced the great potato war🤛🤛📈📈📈📈📈 respect
bro izes a dictator
tbh my favrouite nation was the arctic, it was peacfull and stuff, also it is snowy there, i was born in mid winter, so makes it better, i also loved the part were seup just abandoned his team last seccond, also i feel like ize was probably one of the worst kings not tryna be rude, he was really just rudee and i feel like the other guy would of been better.
I really thought jungle would win tho
I F*CKING SUBBED FOR THE ZOMBIE  STILL LOYAL TILL THE END
bro i like your videos and the server veryyyyyyyyy muuuuuuuch but i cant afford to buy the minecraft in pc  its not like we dont have money we just dont have any card to buy minecraft but i still like your videos keep up the good work bro

genishin (jen-shuu-nnn)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxZXCxixEOI Here's another civilisation video!
Definitely do MORE videos LIKE THIS, Silver!
Desert was my fav
Q
I can't wait for the day that 1,000 player Minecraft Civilizations become a thing.
I liked jungle
I saw xnestorio 0:03
One of the best videos I’ve seen
Desert
OH MY FLIPFLOP That video went hard🐄
SUPPORT OUR SPONSOR GENSHIN!!   Wait for my rerun banner😉
1 mor please
makes sense why they won i mean they had necromancer abilities to revive a dead player who terrorized the strongest king and killed the last person
Jungle my fav kingdom
Jungle should have win
I was really hoping jungle would win 😔
Yeah, desert kingdom didn't let me down to defeat the Jungle and cocky Jungle leader.
Silver: “…Sheared some leaves…”  My brain: shi-
So it’s cold communist Russia, the Brazilians in their jungles and the Wild West Americans… nice
what about 100 players make civilization in the custom nether?
Sounds like a movie plot
#sub2silver #genshinimpact
do you have the map downlaod for this ?
Dam if i joined i whould have not joined my civilization and be busy making a huge wall to separate me and my civilization from invaders then again i dont have Minecraft
jungle
My favorite group is the artic
That jungle king truthly earned my respect.
14:48 That player is very sus.....
ahh, this video was amazing! It looked really fun to play too! :D
i love mc lore
I liked the jungle
Man star killer deserve better smh
Hi silver
This was fun I would love to see more of this
“Please give me rome, Please give me rome. What- Siberia!”
Not me getting UPSET about the jungle vote. Long live star 💫
Desert is so nice they deserve to win
you mean fourth best potato farmer noobycraft is first, light_exists is second, then techno and squid
my favorit was  jungle
I was determined that the jungle would win.
Is these challenge videos played on java edition or both bedrock and Java edition  Because I am a bedrock edition player I don't have a pc
amzing my fav was artic but desert was cool to i didn't very much like the jungle king i liked star though  great vid :)
Jungle
Im squid kid is here
Wait- how did u even get squid kid in this vid
Can you do more of this, but there can be more biomes and more classes
I honestly think jungle would’ve won if starkiller was king!
Ihate jungle
Great video. Inspiring me to make more minecraft video lol!
jungle deserved to win :/ my opinion but ize was a chad he was like Genghis Khan but in minecraft
ngl I was ruting for jungle under starkiller then went to desert after ize took over
Jungle should have won
Noo genshin impact sponsor 😭 hes gonna gain 200 pounds 💀
At lest the ad is genshin impact
This was Awesome
20:23 rip squid and his lead
me: is no way of desert change the game luck os desert: i think yes
I love the artic
Are you going to do another I loved it I kinda wannabe in it
The desert and jungle war was like something you'd hear out of ancient war stories with the guy dying from falling off the statue of their god and the zombie coming to help kill the king
I was hoping for the jungle kingdom
jungle
Props to the abstract zombie he was INSANE
why do that to the arctic they were so nice  Now im mad >:(
genshin impact  music in the background lol
If I was.playing with my friends I would hide.in trees waiting for an invasion and then fire our flame bows at the invaders XD
Hello there.. I do funny minecraft vids. Yeah come check out “100 days in one block lucky block”
I was routing for artic but if artic died I was routing for desert and it’s impressive because surviving there is hard
Best mine craft YouTuber
PLEASE DO A PART 2
Yo silver you should have a sequel where both jungle and artic join forces to defeat the desert
didnt expect it being sponsored by genshin impact
how long did this video take to make? How long were the players playing minecraft?
I love these types of videos
23:52 says the Irish man
Ik it's a game, but the jungle dude was an big asshole man
No hate, but a youtuber named MagicGum already did this with the same thumbnail. Great video, just think credit should be given to the original creator.
He used genshin impact music from a battle in liyue
Everyone quit talking you know the second best farmer what if technoblade saw this
I  would like a sequel for this vid
Lesson learned. Never attack first always let the other battle it out and then you can sweep in.
how do i get in one
Jungle nation cuz murder or something like that
I Liked jungel
Artic was my fav
AM KEEPING THSI COW SAFE CAUSE THERE IS GONNA BE A HUNGER EVENT
Who noticed the music was from mario?
I need 400000¥
HOW CAN I JOIN IN YOUR MAPSSSS PLEAAAASSEEEE
EPIC!!
THIS IS SUCH. A AWESOME VID
Well I liked none
2:22 bruh THE SHADE >:D
Silver is definitely one of the most creative youtubers out there.
I'm leaving this comment here so if anyone likes this comment I get a notification and get reminded of this masterpiece
Nice squid kids there :D
Bruh, I thought the artic nations build looked better
Super informative video!!
the jungle is a shit xd
I swear that the leader of jungle is the worst ruler you could ever have, hot headed, doesnt let the team choose and threatens to kill anyone who thinks twice
That one guy who heard the name Genshin Impact:Oh Genshin impact?!? HELL YEAH BABY!!
The jungle temple is easy to beat while the other have a hard time because it's hard
"The best potato farmer" nope Technoblade took that title after some of the best quotes of all time including "if hypixel has taught me anything it's that if you have a problem the answer is slavery" "no no this cant be this man made 8 potato 11 minions and then he painted the mona lisa" and many others but anyway technoblade took spud kids title of #1 potato farmer
The Nations are like real ones  Antarctic: Poland Desert: India Jungle: USA, The Roman Empire, UK during the Magna Carta, The Empire of Russia during the Russian revolution, Roc, Morocco, China during the Chinese Revolution,  Vichy France, German Reich, Japan during the Shogunate and Afghanistan
why the fuck duz he sound like that
OMG AFTER THE JUNGLE KING DIED I WAS SOOOOOO HAPPY LIKE HE WAS SUCH A MEANIE TO HIS OWN PEOPLE I'M SUPRISED THEY DIDN'T TURN ON HIM
the background music dound like genshin impact them
Jungle National is the best
Says lead by the best potato farmer me yoooo it's techno then says wait no second best
Besttttt viiiidddeo ever😄😃😃🙂
No.   Sabers
i liked the artic the best
The middle of the video: Antarctic: "Silent night, Holy Night, All is calm, All is bright" Desert: *Bringing a guy from the dead" Jungle: "This guy sucks, vote me" "Let them vote for who ever they want" "NO! THEY'RE GONNA VOTE YOU SINCE YOUR DOING AN ABE LINCOLN" "AT LEAST IM NOT PULLING AN ASSASSINATION" "THAT WONT MATTER, YOUR A HORRIBLE KING" "NO YOU!" " *NO YOU!* " " **NO YOU!!** " " ***NO YOU!!!*** "
26:43 dude this man is a bad king, I lked the other one! he was more respectful!
Attic had the best potato farmers wait no the second best potato farmer the. I’m like you did him dirty
will you be making more 100 player civilization videos?
What's the seed
DO MORE OF THESE
I would've been so mad if the jungle kingdom won.
Kind of hoped that the jungle would win
ize kinda sounds like one of those toxic gamers that haven't touched grass in like a year
the best potato farmer oh wait second best potato farmer im a technoblade fan that was funny
i love that the jungle king lost. people like thatmake me worry about post apocolyptic situations lol all they care about is power. they woukld have won if they worked together.
Squid you second best potatoes
I love Gidget impact when I downloaded it was super fun
Bro the desert team was scared the whole time and some how came out victorious LOL Btw very very good video
HOW DO I JOIN
I WAS ROOTING FOR ARCTIC :(
lol bad sponsor
THE SNOWWY RUSSIA
magic gum rip off
i liked jungle
I love these videos
Why can't there be a civilization where no one tries to sabotage their fellows players
I liked the desert the most
Vidoe
You might wanna post more often because I’m getting bored with a  indie per 3 months
I liked ize
Continue
didn't squid kid go against technoblade in a potato war (IDK)
just straight up stole the video from MagicGum
Rest in peace for all the people who died
Desert best
i think the jungle were the best :)
That was so entertaining
Who else just skipped the sponsorship?
techno 111111
38:58 I was honestly happy that ize died he was a jerk the whole entire video
I was rooting for jungle but when they chose the rude guy i rooted for artic but it was a plot twist lmao
RESPECT for the 2nd potato farmer XD
anybody else notice genshin impact combat music in the background
Regions don't have borders. But still this was great
25:05 Silver: a player in the desert was caught off guard by a creeper  Also silver: proceeds to show a player in the desert getting killed by a phantom
LETS GOOOOO PROPS FOR DESERT KINGDOM!!!!!!
I was really hoping jungle would win
Jungle village?
Can you do more vids pls plz 🥺😕😞
Question is. Can they repopulate?
"second best potato farmer"  Squid: :(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
Snow civilization
"players have lived peacefuly" ive started 4 countries all communist and 6 wars edit 2:24 xD damn man
This was amazing pls do more
I wish starkiller never died
Oh no silvers getting infected with the genshin impact virus.. we can’t let this happen
If I was the enchanted diamond guy in jungle, I would kill the king
Why was this video called 100 players simulate racist civilizations back then?
That was fire
Where can i download this map
Just in case you haven't heard... God so loved the world He gave His son Jesus that whoever believes in Jesus will have everlasting life. John 3:16 Please believe and repent from your sin today. Eternity in heaven should not be taken lightly, please think about it dont be left behind. Love Y'all
Me: sees squid kid Also me: No way he doesn’t mention him Him: first- I mean second best potato farmer Also also me: HA!
2:16 what are you doing?   Why are you placing diamonds?
genshin impact, is a game where you meet underage girls and most of youtube hates
i followed the twitter see you at the next event
idk about you but i dont want to end up on the 600 lbs show
5:00 the way he protected his friends
2:20 you did squid dirty
If the 90 percent all subed you would have 81 million subs
That is so sick worth the work well done wish I was there tho
i liked the jungle civilizaition
Whoever was singing slient night put credits in for awesome singing🤧✨
ok love the vid but i think the loot chests are a bit un fair
YO SQUID KID
i liked the snow the best
It was Ize's poor choices and cocky attitude that lead to Jungles fall. He was a brutal dictator that was willing to kill his own people to get what he wanted.
i think arctic had the best town.
I dont have twitter :(
I liked the jungle but after they got there king I didn’t like them
very neat video :D
30:45 The jungle people were like: lets kill the statute amo he us like I'm game
I rooted for team Artic, but when betrayed team jungle, I knew team Artic deserved to die.
2:21 squid kid from the great potato war~technoblade
The jungle king was a tactical genius. He won a battle outnumbered crossing jungles and mountains and a giant lake, all chock full of mobs. He almost won a battle when he was outnumbered by 10, and almost lead his team to victory against two nations allying each other. o7
He said the best potato farmer wait never mind the 2nd best potato farmer to Im_a_squid_kid
When is the next time you plan on hosting this event?
Bro- I want to be the jungle group- they seem the most peaceful Bc it’s just beautiful- how about they make peace between with all the people in different groups.
I like jungle
War
I love your videos so much
Aww I really liked the artic!
The “I mean 2nd best potato farmer” 😂😂😂😂😂
Désert for EVER
I liked the dessert because the Arctic joined them
Does the kingdom baby
I really enjoyed this video
In my opinion star would have lead the jungle to a great and honorable vic royale
World hunger starting* Silver: before world hunger i’d Like to sponsor genshin impact
Sequel
9:02
This is why they needed Starkiller to win cause Ize is too greedy and worthless to all, the person who kill star he's the reason the jungle lost
*Throws in XNestorio*
35:53 tell me why the way he said “gosh” has me rolling 🤣
this guy used to be a uhc/blitz survival games youtuber on hypixel. look at where he is now. legend
Jungle was my favorite
rest iin peace to the people who died at the begging
THIS WAS FIRE
I was routing for Arctic the whole time 😞
Jungle
TAKE A SHOWER JUNGLE PPL
Yo wasn’t this already done ???  Kinda seems like a copy cat video…..
zamn
Why did the arctic have a terrible fate they were *SUS*
no
Desert my favorite civilization
Derest
this is sick
LITERAL MOVIE
I love you 😘💕❤️
how did the arctic town lose that's a straight robbery they had the best town easily
Jungle leader was like Hitler
Casually puts on super Mario bros u music based on what biome silver is looking in
Jungle was def the best
I already played genshin and finishe sit but needed the characters u mentioned for compelte Ing the collection
Mario Music🥲
2:25 Brruuuuuuh It's been years and people still remember the potato war~~~~
where is the player trying to be helicoptor ):
Genshin esponsor 💀
5:01 “Inevitability” didn’t even attempted to flee the creeper. He was loyal to his name
🤯HOW JUST HOW
I want to do this.
Again, I said so listen to me do it
2:21 Techno: HEH!?
Please do this in bedrock 🙏
I liked the jungle more :( They were the ones that wanted to win the most I think, they attacked the other nations and didnt care if they died. They tried.
last jungle guy was dumb
Amazin if technoblade was in this.
no credit to Magic Gum?
What a tyrant!!! I wish Starkiller hadn't died...
AAAAAAAA THE SPONSER YAE MIKO PLZ COME HOME    also i feel like i hearthe genshin inazuma fighting music in the background at some points
Make a second vid plz!!!
Although I hate ize he is a real war lord😅😅
If u make another one can I be in one?
I hate ize
2:22 ur evil… xd (upload skyblock plssssss)
Rest in peace star 🤧
Y did u do the artic people like dat😤
Love dis video
technoblade Never Dies Wicked
I like this type of content. Keep up the good work!
The genshin impact background music.. NICE

How do we get this mod/data pack?
Says civilization  My mind:RIsE oF kiNGDoMs!!!
i like jungle
I play Genshin impact
More pls
I'm just glad the jungle lost
the jungle king was a asshole
Man the arctic dudes could have won this war if they just strategized it.. if i was the leader and the distribution of the classes are by 10 then i would have assigned 3-5 warriors to scout the maning being guards then 3-5 people mining a tunnel from the capital to the fortress in case of emergency and the remaining to gather materials and the farmes can just farm.. if they used this always stayed calm they could have won.. Good video too..
Desert
This video was sponsored by legend of Zelda breath of the wild
Not sure why this bothers me so much but everytime you said begun you should have said began, begun always has had in front of it if you are going to use that tense of the word
stop silver!!!!!!
He's back!!
stop!!!!!!!
Is this the main channel now?
whats the mod for this
Yooo it’s I’m a squid kid from techno’s potato war videos
oh my god finally u uploaded xd
I love desert i love if
I liked the desert and arctic, but a I think suep should have not betrayed desert
More pleased
I liked the winter team the best
I love genshin impact
Been subbed since 15k
UR USING GENSHIN MUSIC
I am a squid kid was in technos Potato war sky block
The artic is the best at building but jungle good at ambushing and the desert is got the biggest number of players. But i i like the most is the artic i loved the build and organization
this is sooooo greeeaatttt video, how much of effort do you put on this?
I would just go ahead and leave that mean jungle leader and team up with the other civilisation
I feel bad for StarKiller. He was an actual nice guy, and he had genuine leadership skills. Just sucks he was out voted due to not having good enough gear to become king.
I think the Arctic was the best looking and was hoping they would win :/
The desert won like they deserved, all is good with the world. The jungle guy was such an unlikeable sweatlord. The kind of person you hate to play with.  On top of everything he was kind of a dumbass
I am jungle from first but desert won
SORRY BUT DESERT TERRIBLE  WASNT FAIR IMA JN SUB AND DISLIKE
sub to Loseax Silver and viewers Pls . . . . . . .
WE WANT MORE OF DEEZ!!!!!!!       ❌its not a joke✅its a hazard Who here likes minecraft?
I didn’t realize you were using liyue battle music till the temples were introduced. Best music choice
Id like to see more of there civilization content
Nooo!!!that was unexpected tho
I was so happy to be included in this video, thanks silver (DONUT CULT FOREVER)
#stopyoutubescammers
Artic
Silver using people for content.
You should make a sequel where foreign nations decide to explore new territories via boat and try to take out the native desert nation when the desert nation gets help by mysterious allies long forgotten. Idk, it’s just a suggestion
The jungle region shouldn't have rushed when they lost players, they should've ran to get a sneak attack.
More
T
I play genshin
Nerf miner
Jungle is the best
2:22 squid is not even top 10 any more xD
"and you killed none of them? gosh" 😭😭
I thought jungle is going to win but unfortunately they lost. Great videos I am a new subscriber I am really enjoying ur channel 😁😁
jungle man you failed me
I love ur editing so much
I was really hoping for the snow region to come out on top (also bc squid kid was there) but I'm still happy on how theis all came out :)
Jeez this video was the best quality and fun and enjoyable video to watch in my whole month please make this a sequel
Jungle
𝕎𝕠𝕨
‘Tis is actually a very good video and very good content
yeah it was true you did read it wrong squid kid is the second best potato farmer we all know that
2:23 LMAO
Before I was with jungle but I did not like the king so I switch to destert
The jungle guys were convinced to join Ize's side easily because he made a few good points about how he will lead them to victory, but unlike Star, was yet to demonstrate any actual leadership skills or planning. He literally said it himself in the first war that they were kamikazing it, having literally no plan or strategy. The main reason they won was just because of the surprise element and better gear. Ize was all over the place most of the time and took crazy irrational decisions without thinking. Had they not been so aggressive, maybe the tides would have turned to their side considering that their homeland was already hard to travel through so anyone wanting to attack them would have had to deal with their natural defenses already present. Instead, Ize decided to get everyone to travel through those defenses instead, a very foolish move. Had the Arctic been more prepared, they would have won and Ize would have been demonstrated to be the fool that he was. Either way, it was incredibly satisfying to see him beg the general of the very people he fought against earlier for mercy, only to be defeated at the end. All in all, incredible work put in by Silver. You just earned a subscriber. Keep these kinds of videos coming. ;)
Jungle nation
I liked the jungle untl starkiller died
25:06 caught off guard by a creeper
I just realized that squid kid, technoblade's formal rival was there XD
ME WANT SEQUEL with a nether sort of biome and more events to make it more "interesting"
guys dont forget you'll see him in 4-7 months
I miss SpeedSilver :( Please come back to sb
Civilization war 2
Rip artic kingdom
Technoblode lol
I’d love to see this again, but with 6 nations and 200-300 people, it would def take a lot longer to make, but it would be a hell of a lot of fun
I uhh… I kinda hate ize as a person
The "king" how killed starkiller was a horrible king . 😠
Great there's another youtuber
300 days a shapesher in minecraft now
Imagine Technoblade in Arctic kingdom
Please make another video like this
more vids like this plz
I wanted arctic to win 😭
you didnt even credit ish or magicgum
Squid kid FROM THE POTATO WAR
Iza was the best leader! In game, in real life he's just Hitler.
I loved jungle
19:44 I'm being honest the ice rink people do not deserve this.    Am I way too invested in this?
I wish I could do this
Rip squid_kid
Stop doing the ads it's really annoying
Great video just found it   would be epic if the survivors won money
I can’t log in genshin impact
Absolutely mindblowing much love ❤️❤️❤️
Do moro but there-is sky  nether    End   Under ground.  And suply drops
I have been waiting for one of you're new videos for a while now. Keep it up!
I want jumggle to win but the king was a bad one
LETS GO DESERT
DESERT KINGDOM VERY COOL
the background music is from genshin impact
honestly if they all jumped ize at the start the prot 1 armor aint gon do shit and theyd be better
Ize is gonna die first due to someone targeting him next 100 days due to his actions
at the third time i watched this video i was in the middle genshin impact at the same time
I like jungle until Ize took over then desert
Make a sequel pls
what happened to speedsilver? like if u want him back
wow 🤩🤯
Abstrakt the goat
I like the Jungle one
I really liked the Arctic,bc of their buildings.
We all know who the real hero is peace to abstract zombie
A part 2 but in the nether
jungle
I liked the desert  kingdom but i thought the winter kingdom will win
Desert didnt have a lotta recources at the start but kater they had a lotta skills
So good
I like the desert most
Everyone: fighting bravely still not killing any kings Abstrakt's who is dead: *literally kills two king all by himself*
Damn the dictatorship of the jungle was my fav
Please make a part 2 and also how to be in this project?
This is basically Raya and the last dragon but minecraft
38:14 :)......why seup 40:07 op husk lol
YEAHHH THE EPIC DEBATE
Quick tip for people that wanna do raids: If ur being chased by a ravager go underwater and the ravagers will just stay at the surface but im not sure it works like that on bedrock Like or comment if this was helpful :)
Crazy video man
It was kinda stupid of those jungle guys to just go to the next nation without any more preperations or organisation that's a death wish lol
The natives dont like being killed, not sure why tho
Noooooo jungle :(
I’ve been tryna find ytrs who make these vids and show the povs of some players and fortunately U EXIST :D
I hate the jungle king
I loved ize
Abstrek was the real mvp also the one who brought him all the way over
i liked arctic the most because they had a nice spirit in town and just wanted to be peacefull
Ize is a bad king because he only cares about winning and doesnt care about losing his own teammate that dies during the blood moon,but stark is a good king because he is good at leading their civilization
brooo jungle mvp
My favorite civilization was the ice people bc not only they where the most joy full they where also the chilliest (literally).  Also I love all your videos I'm one of the ones who subscribed before you had 1 million :D
i remeber when one of them found a lot of diamond and said oMg i fEeL tHe p0Wa
I liked the jungle with star and want much more
sick video, i loved it.
another idea would be 5 nations: below hell,  over heaven,  shining gold, burning nether, endless ender.  all containing 20 players BUT they are given roles: the traitors: 2 (if they want, the can join forces with others)  the farmer:3 (they're the only ones who can breed animals, farm crops,...)  the king:1( triple health, double damage, less faster than a player)  the queen:1(double health, double speed, can hide her/his username to all [[except mods]])  the vampire:1(can't live in day, triple health, double damage, needs to kill 3 players of his own town to get his skills activated)  normal people: 12(basically a minecraft player)
More videos of civilizations🥺
I liked the desert the  most
The beach crossing for jungle was d day for them
anyone heard Stampy 16:28
The amount of effort put into this. Amazing video Silver!
jungle
FUN FACT: the music in the back ground is from genshin
i always knew the desert kingdom would win
The dead among us was funny
Silver the man that always puts a smile 😁 on my face sick vid and cool crawn
I love artic kingdom because they love genshin impact <33
Best, wait, second best potato farmer Go techno

I like arktick civilization
i like how you realize techno beat squid kid and is currently the best potato farmer XD :) edit: btw sorry squid kid
Jungle was basically Germany during world war 1
Do more!!!!    Pls?

Jungle
I liked the arctic and the desert civilisation the most bc jungle civil was stupid
I just noticed that you were using genshin themes and music and thats rlly nice
Original jungle leader is a biiitch
I love the jungle king hes a treu warking
How can I be apart of experiments like this?
I really like that moment when a player suddenly appeared and said oh genshin impact hell yeah baby
*squid doesn’t win wars, period*
Im a sqiud kid got ROSTED
(●'◡'●)
this feels extremely inspired from magicgum
The cow despawed bcs it isn't have a name tag
im hyped for a new civilization video! if there is going to be another civilization video, where can i join the server?
xnestorio hello my feforet youtubeer

Jungle's king was straight up a d*ckhead
This video was so cool! I realy want to participate !
man your comment sections are just full of bots
i wanted jungle to win ;(
More pls
Sequel and the prequel to the sequel
The jungle king is a ruthless dictator
jungle
I liked the Desert Nation because they have a great teamwork. Everyone seems to be in control like noone is king even the king cooperates like he's not a king.
It was sooooooooooooo interesting i like it pls make part 2
How do you talk like that it is annoying!
Who said 3 innocent people's lives were not just entertainment
I loved the jungle
I liked  the desert kingdom. They were calm and collected
i kinda liked the winter more and i was so sad that they had the worst rate in the builds
Squid is still the same lmao
Him: hunger event  Me: famine event :)
jungle
I was at first rooting for Jungle but I quickly changed my mind because the king they had was mean and force people to do what they didn't want. Winter had the coolest town. But the desert was the coolest.
who saw that name:childCHOMPER
The potato joke got me laughing so hard
I love this video
I can't use twitter but I want to be in these videos, how? @Silver
"oh yeah genshin impact hell yeah baby" said by shrek lokin dood
That moment when the zombie just right out attack the tyrant king is nothing less than perfect, if this was a movie not in Minecraft form that development would be a low budget move, but bcuz is Minecraft that was hilarious and surprising
I am your all subscribers
I got recommended this video and proceeded to watch every one of ur videos! Will have notif bell on. Quality content
Next time you should play
I love the joke with squid kid
fuck desert
Man's using the sick genshin music

Imagine if clown was here
I love the desert team
Second one plz silver

Even due to tis day.

555555555555555555555

How are you playing i thought you were playing but there's xnestorio 👌
At first I like the arctic civilization more but then at the end I like the desert civilization
I am sad jungle didn't win :/
jungle kingdom there alls ways chances for retreating
Silvers animation at the start is really good.
i can’t wait for his next 100 days hardcore vid
Do more like this content .we really appreciate it
I like the artic clan its so beutiful
technoblade is there?
YES I KNEW IT WATCHING YOU BEFORE MY EXAM GIVES ME MORE CONFIDENCE AND I GOT A PERFECT SCORE
Arctic are sus
famous last words before being brutally slaughtered: "have u ever heard of genshin Impact"
Nice work 110 out of 100. I know this was very hard for you.  Minecraft  best content ever seen. Not lying.  Add much more content like this. Jungle,desert,arctic,water,taiga,nether and end civilizations.
why did this guy-   on the subscribe part of the video it had 9m subscribers....what?
NO the Among us R.I.P
haha saitama is in minecraft
the fucking desert
ize may have been ruthless but he did have a point
On the building aspect, snow is my favorite. Jungle second favorite, in my opinion desert looked the worst  Strategy: desert
This is very unique and everyone who will see this want's to see this more
You should continue this kind of content
Bro
I need to do this with my friends which i have got my dad, friend A, Friend B, Friend C, cross friend, and almost my brother so i will recruit every body and make the map with a potential time that it will be released
i like u Vidio
the jungle kingdom was doing so good until that stupid king came along
This was really interesting idea...... Squid Kid burn was fire...... 🔥     No pun intended
Ize is a classic example of a Tyrant. Glad they lost.
The arctic was my favorite
ANIME
I want the map befor all of this
Then the Jungle Nation attacked. Lol, nice vid tho it’s really good. The detail in the custom buildings and mobs are great. Also I mean, cmon, the jungle nation was completely ruthless with king ize in control.
Lol chungeldor sounded like Thor
"multiplyeya"
Yes
JUNGLE IS THE BEST
DO MORE BUT THE SIME
Luv ur videos silver!!!!!!!!!
This is amazing I want to be in one so bad
My favorite is desert because i have a nation in the dessert in my minecraft world and the name is emerald empire
Every sequel I will be around for you NAILED IT
This could be a Netflix show😳
Whoever you are if you are not subscribed I will DESTROY you and EVERYTHING you own. Subscribe!
the actic deserved beter >:{
i liked jungle civilization
Nice xnestorio join
Nice job desert
make education edition minecraft video plz i wanna join :)
Desert
stop copying other youtubers
the leader of jungle was so bloodthursted that he didn't even gave his some of  teammates good gears that's why they lost
it rlly depends on the biome like the jungle which has plenty of resources like wood and food unlike the desert and snow since food and resources are rare and they have to preserve it
Do a nether civilisation video. Where the different biomes are civilities. Like if u aggree
squid kid just got rosted
My favorite was Arctic because it was so festive 😊
Star would've been a much better king for the jungle
The Artic was the best and the jungle was the worst
That was so good
Yay!!! Genshin!
I love this video  you should do more civilization  videos like this
You should do one with Overworld, Nether, End
Will you invite me on a new video
I feel like everyone will eternally make fun of squid kid for being second in the potato war lmao
Ayo cool video btw
the sponcer is world zero from roblox
bro the artict was the best one!
Why did they all like genshin but ok
I hate bots
Isnt tropic a better for the jungle
Ay love silver vidos
That zombie player knew his death wouldn’t let him down and charge at that man surprised why they didn’t put the crown on him
The heck is water protection
I liked the artic nation
Arctic for life!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sad jungle loses..
What a terrifying way to die lol. an undead warrior slowly approaches chanting "have you ever heard of Genshin Impact?"
Squid kid was a legend I’m sad he died
noooooooooooo!!!   why genshin impact???  why why why
19 minutes to go I'm still watching
I Will say artict cuz they got teamwork even tho they are few of them they still fight back
loved how the arctic people got mad and sad when the ravager killed 3 of their people. Just shows they really bonded as a civilization 😤🥺.
DEASRET CHEATED
what is a ice rink
his videos should be on netflix as a series i swear 💛
I liked the jungle kingdom untill star was killed and they charged into war. Then I rooted for desert
I would say do a group of 2 warriors, 1 farmer, and 1 miner  fo each civilization for increased survival rate The group can be defended by 2 warriors and a miner quickly mining stuff and a farmer for the food it’s a easy win
Silvers videos are pure gold both on editing and content killing it man ;-;
i like artic
Had desert winning all the way
Bro you just gave rise of kingdom advertisers an idea
Jesus loves u all.  Have you done or said something kind to someone today? Even a smile can make someone's day! Alot of pple are hurting these days.. alot arr suffering in silence. Many are lonely isolated even feeling suicidal.. If it's hard to be around people in-person , reach out with love to someone on youtube or social media! Stand up for someone in the comments, compliment someone, give someone hope and encouragement, share your story to help someone. Do something positive and meaningful with your time!  God bless all yall here ❤
insane video
I love the fact that the zombie in desert civilization doesn't attack the desert player
I was hoping the jungle would  win. :(
My fav was the desert
Also want players to be revived but only if some body uses some magic like a mage role
wtf the jungle king is sooooo unbelievably toxic
I all ready play Genshin I am ar 53 but thanks for the code
Hope aetic wins
Think you should do 200 people's
Dessert rules
I like that you used super Mario Wii / Wii U music for the different biomes.
genshin impact is fucking dog shit
I just noticed the background music is from Genshin
i loved the artic biome
This is such a cool video idea. Absolutely love it. Never thought of this idea
I was rooting for the Jungle, too bad they lost so many on the way to the Arctic and by Soup taking out stragglers. With the refugees the Desert outnumbered them by a long shot and in the end it came down to numbers.
Bro almost slipped up almost had to call #1 potato farmers techno
Gonna be real jungles leader was a dick but he walked back into town alone and bullied everyone into submission when they could’ve ganged up and killed him
3 people genshin sponsored
Considering this is #16 on trending (as of writing this) I’m pretty sure he will make another
Genshen impact is a stupid rip-off off Zelda anyone who thinks it’s better then Zelda is just weird.
Although Ize was the villain in this story- IM SO HAPPY HES BACK- YES- MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER LIVES- HES MY KING- I LOVE MY KING YOOOO
silver dissed squid kid soo hard
Bruh
This is amazing please if possible do more!
man he killed squid at 2:26
Wow, this looked like Sparta vs Athens, so cool! Great job Silver!
This is an epic video I didn’t want to leave my seat
This channel is getting alot better in such a small time.
I would choose miner
are u gonna make another shapeshifter vid i liked those ones
Dude soup was to brutal for that one jungle boy
Arctic
2:20 that’s savage
Plss 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 do a sequel I loved it so much plss do more silver I'll even sub if u do kkkkk plsss I loved it
Abstract zombie is the true mvp
More pls
Ahh yes, squid kid is no longer the best potato farmer
Props to- whoever edits your videos…  holy crap
Bruh if they didn’t kill Starkiller they would have won
POV: 5:00 One death is a wipeout lmfao
i hate desert so much
I was hoping for the last survivors of artic to win
Poor squid XD
0.o this is so cool
Suep and squid r the best here ok? ALSO SEQUAL THIS THING GOOD AF
I HATED the jungle leader and the snow survivors and because the we're being so toxic
Bruh i was routing on ice D:
It's really good 👍
Ice
Sequel please this is really good video.
speedsilver? wtf?
yesss second
Gosh I think jungle was the best bc of stars leadership it hurts to see him dead
Star really was a charismatic and nice guy. The uk dude was a selfish prick. Did i really get invested in minecraft custom server drama like a soap opera? You're goddamn right.
The Mario music is amazing in the back and each region is that in Mario
I def liked the most the desert
Starkiller was a proper fucking leader, believing in his people and placing the good of his civilization over himself. Unlike Ize, he respected democracy and willingly let his rival take power because it was decided by the people. And how did his comrades repay him? With a knife in his back, and by following a warmongering tyrant. Their hubris is what led to their defeat
I loved this video, however, not so much the cast, specifically seup and ize, they deserved what happened to them
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Ize out here pulling some Yeagerist shit
I liked desert to begin with then I liked the king of jungle so it changed to jungle, but he got ambitious so it changed to Arctic, and before the war started it changed back to desser
Its nice to see SpeedSilver's old friends like palikka and refraction from skyblock take place in this video :) Keep up the great work
I liked artic
18:34 jungle house
Yes
ize knows what's up lol
personally artic was my favourite civilisations
German/America/Russia.
0:09 technoblade and painful joined the game????
Didnt expect the zombie to help 💀
0:08 Xnestorio joined the game????
If star killer became jungle King jungle would have won
MEPs: Joint Efforts Several MEPs from different countries who attended the hearing strongly condemned the organ harvesting crimes committed by the CCP. They urged the European Parliament to take actions to curb organ harvesting and enhance organ transplant regulation as well as transparency.   MEP Maria Arena hosted the hearing.  Maria Arena, chair of the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, hosted the hearing. She said that auditing and transparency of organ harvesting are critical. This means deeper discussions are needed to explore how the European Parliament can influence China and follow up on this issue. This is not only limited to legal aspects but more options could also be considered at EU Plenary Meetings.   MEP Isabel Santos from Portugal  Isabel Santos, MEP from Portugal, is another member of the subcommittee on human rights. She said that data provided by Elliott did show organ harvesting was taking place in China on an industrial scale, which highlights the urgency of stopping the crime. The EU and other international organizations must join forces to stop the tragedy. She had heard about many cases in which Falun Gong practitioners were persecuted. And the victims are not limited to them.  Organ harvesting is truly a crime against humanity, explained Santos. Simply classifying it as a criminal activity is not enough. Those who benefit from organ harvesting or participate in it should also be viewed as criminals. This is probably the only way to stop it.   MEP María Soraya Rodríguez Ramos from Spain  María Soraya Rodríguez Ramos, MEP from Spain and another member of the subcommittee, said that organ harvesting in China has proven to be industrial-scale killing. She urged the EU to institute laws to prevent these organs from entering EU countries. She said this was an unprecedented crime and it is hard to believe it exists in the 21st century.  MEP Raphael Glucksmann from France agreed. He said this was one of the worst crimes we could see on earth.  EEAS Official: Human
So when are you making another video like this
Jungle
Great video Silver! Super entertaining the whole way through!
9:08 😂😂

I liked The artic The most 2 desert and 3 jungle
Hi
Why does desert always win...??
I love the “wait read that wrong. Second best potatoe farmer.”  Sorry squid but LESS GO TECHNO
When will this actually become actual public server
2:55 *NO.*
Silver is sooooo-pasific but when i find out how  to donate money I'll pay 330
Jungle
ize a bitch but i would like him the most as a leader
And Also love desert nation
Please
Please Can I be in one video pls
DESERT
I wanted jungle to win
XNestrio Joined?
i love the vid super good vid
In my opinion the Arctic had the best looking town. If not first place, I feel like they should have gotten a least second. (in the build contest)
I love Genshin, thanks for the code for 60 primos 😁
pls make skyblock vids again they were cool make them on ur main channel speedsilver to not mess this channel theme
I liked jungle
Great job

THIS CONCEPT IS INSANE

Artic gang!!!!!!
I liked the jungle
I liked the Jungle nation the most
Boo! !
I was rooting for desert
POTATO
Jungle nation was the best in my opinion
I love these kinds of vids
Yes
i like desert
want to see more
A wise minecraft player once said: DANCE POTATO BOY DANCE
Make more of this
Of course there’s a tyrant (the jungle) Love your vids very interesting to watch
Yooo no way infernally the most insane bedwars player is here
Make one with all biomes!
jungle
the editing is just so good
The jungle deserved victory
Jungle
this is the best vid cuz of squid kid
I love that your videos are long and fun
First I was liking how the jungle was doing then when the king election started I knew desert was gonna win
Why  ize has so much Mussolini vibes? Also suep sucks because at the end he literaly allied with the man who had done genocide  on his people, desert was too passive but organized, the artic kingdom was cool and the funniest and jungle is the example of how dictatorships are born
Oh my f*cking god that was the best kingdom minecraft server video i ever seen in my life but it took so long
i love the jungle
Those Mario soundtracks are my childhood
8:37 That's like if God was curious about what's inside a huge mountain next to a civilization and cracks it open, only to set off an excessive volcanic eruption. XD
Thats the best mc video i watch
Bro pleeeeeaaaassse make a sequel
I was rooting for artic nation...
Arctik
artic
The Mario music
Can please you do a 100 days in song of war mod
Again  Again Again
squidkid sucks lol
So one thing I thought was interesting about this video is that their literally a guy with a very similar name to my Minecraft name which I’m like oh that a coincidence but then the guy next to him in all red, I’m like wait that the skin I use just slightly different
my opinion was arctic had best build
Ik loved arctic
This is an insanely good vid
I liked jungle
where you tell viewers that some event event is happening? i would really like to appriciate in one of these events like this. Btw love ur content best youtuber ever <3
The funniest part was when Undead Abstrekt chased down the literal king of the jungle region and won them the war
I was rooting for jungle
So cool keep up the amazing content 👍
I liked the Jungle most
amazing video, liked it very much, hope to see more wars
Yes I would like to see another sequel please please please please please could you make it longer
amazing vid
Hey man wen are you going to do this again
it was awesome ls make a another
JUNGLE ON TOP
He never disappoint us with his work
i like how from 5:55 plays the sound of liyue from genshin lol
U read Teyvat wrong lol
I I wanted jungle to win
i was kinda hoping that jungle would win but they did not :-:
I hate ize and yes i like jungle if the other leader got voted
Next video like this
We need part two of this
Why bully squid
if i was in this i would completely ditched my team and set up a underground secret tunnel ways to other bases eventually nuking their bases
Huge respect to robbiemcfly🤣
No ice king
Keep up the good content
i was so glad ot see Jungle go down. That dude was an arrogant PoS
You know I like the jungle kingdom
Abstreck WILL NEVER FORGET HIS TRUE SELF EVEN THO HE DIED AND WAS BROUGH BACK to Life He became an undead zombie but He always and  will be DESERT MEMBER AT HEART  And there we go he had the last kill and hit  and destroyed the last member of the jungle kingdom as a zombie but i think he was a volatile a sentient one he can control himself in day light but go out of controll in night time  This is the perfect vid to end my day this day not that im dying
I liked jungle at first but they were too reckless starkiller could have done better
Wait wait wait squid kid is here? bruh techno is better then him
What is this song 10:26
That is amazing
I love Deserts the most, they're all good at building and fighting with being kind in mix of that. Jungle was just sh*t, the reason being is that all of them are just weak except for the "overgeared" King blinded by arrogance and completely ignored 'that' obvious problem and charging on his own stupidity. Arctic was a wholesome but carefree weak nation, it was predictable they would lose.  Also i'm a Xiao main around AR40 in Genshin Impact :)
I like the arctic cuz they have skating! and peaceful lol
its like the arctic village is britian and jungle is nazi germany and desert is soviet union like ww2
Im so amazed by this and I almost just like watched a movie! And I was kinda rooting for jungle but im happy of the sand village winning because I rooted for them too because they have a good teamwork!
I was going for jungle but when that guy in nether rite armour the guy who became king I was sad
Another underrated youtuber 😕
Attic my fav it had the beautiful Christmas tree and songs
I like these vids keep on silver um sorry speedsliver
Please make a sequel
Please make a sequel
wow that was one of the best vids that i have ever watched
I love this content it's like im watching a history documentary movie or even better
Wow Silver i Like this But i want u to do a Hardcore
Among us die zombies kill one player remains soooo funny ok i Like snow kingdom
This was a great video ize was a amazing antagonist and made the video even more interesting. Star killer was also good sucks he died tho really hope there's like a season 2 of this
THE TRUE BREAD IS HERE
I love the videos
Bro thw jungle for me was the smarter team
sometimes i wish i could play on these "events" and make world peace
"guys don't be persuaded he just has an accent!" -squidkid 2022
It was just like game of thrones  Everyone's trying to get their hand on throne 🥶🥶
THIS IS THE BEST MINCRAFT VIDEO IVE EVER WATCHED
Watching it other half of the video after doing homework phewwww
Yooo! This video was epic! Thanks for the vid!
sad jungle
Jungle
in every civilization video I root for the desert
I want another one!
This is one of the best videos I have ever seen and I’ve seen a lot of stuff it just made my day
down with ize
Incredible video from start to finish, great work on this Silver!
I LIVE IN CANADA
Ju
Wow amazing video, I love minecraft civilization!!! When season 2 is coming? I wanna join
dude who is your animator they deserve a raise
Nubert likes watching these videos.
Incredible, Go Desert
Can you do a ancient civilizations where theres dragon,cyclops,giant,and other creature With custom armor and weapons too!
I love how Abstract died at the beginning, was brought back to life as undead, was paddled all the way too the desert civilization, and at the last battle, he fought by his desert allies even after death, and technically won them the war.
I like jungle but I am amazed that jungle is staked but can't win fight
I new the desert civilisation would win
is stupid
Zoro got lose🤣
Why don't you make it bedrock and java so mobile players could join
Do it agine plise
Yoo  Silver..this type of content is amazing...definitely would love to see more of this
29:14 it is order 227 in minecraft XD
Wow, I love this video You did a great job
Even thought dessert seem the most unlikely to win, they did win
I'm honestly so glad that Ize was chosen as the king for the Jungle Civilization because it made this video like a movie. I love Starkiller tho, really thought he was going to be chosen as King. The people in this video, without effort, made so many lore with seriousness, jokes, and more. Desert Team was just there to vibe, and Arctic Team was all memes. I love all three of them. Jungle Team all the way, but GG Desert Team!
Jungle deffinetally the most interesting
do that again but with 1000 people
want to see 1000 players simulate civilization in minecraft
Yooo squid boiiii  Dance potato boi dance!!!
Desert for the win!!!
more
Part 2 plz
I would like to see more like this please
Jungles
‘Second best potato farmer’.
I was like Jungle will win but the leader is stupid
My jungle team lost , my favourite team they should have won if they followed the path of team work or even there if that jungle guy didn't get caught by the arctic refuges going to join the desert 😟😟😟😟😟😟🙁☹☹
i liked the jungle nation and my 2nd favourite  was the artic nation  Edit: my favourite is the arctic and i cant decide between 2nd but i think i might like jungle more than desert
That 3rd place supply drop was abit extreme
GG DESERT
It's Amazing
dance party in the snow
hi
artic
Bruh I Kinda Hate The 2nd King Hes So Greedy And Forced His allies
i like the desert team and im glad they won
i hate the ize guy he’s so cocky and think that just because he has the best gear he should be the king
y in my tablet you have 3 epesode y
Wow there are so many famous Minecraft ytbers
Dude I can't believe dessert kingdom won because every time I root for someone they die
Does this required a test or a question why to join this server or you choose the people only and it’s not a official SMP
Yo you've come so far since like 25k-50k when you hadn't even started posting dude except for your like vid explain what ur gonna do lol
I have question can i join AS 13 years old from Poland and shitty internet? I want be like for hours but come up on server sometimes
2:20 SAVAAAAAGEEEEEE
That zombie should've been removed from combat. You can't damage it lmao
Ize gave huge vibes of the kid who owns the ball so they try to control everyone in the game, and when they get embarrassed they just take their ball and go home. Dude literally got everyone to follow him into a suicide missions because “he has better armor” no strategy no planning. Just I want this role so give it to me
zombie guys stomps
I love the part where the undead desert teammate came in and help his friends to follow and kill the toxic ruthless mercyless undeserving jungle king oh yeah I forgot desert kingdom rules baby there my favourite kingdom
Can you do Diamond vs never right vs Gold
Honestly jungle was the best it is sad that they didn't won
Ize fells comminest
for me the general of the Ice nation should have shame for him self he not only  wanted to betray the desert nation who welcome them with kindness he also joined the king of the jungle nation who brutally killed he's nation I know he only wanted the Ice nation to win but still literally he helped the king of jungle nation that shows how he betray he's own nation buy anyway I loved the video
desert was my favriote
The first time I watched silver I felt how is this guy so close to 10 million subs by posting such less vids but now I feel he deserves it keep up the good work silver:)
My favorite civilization was the desert
Jungle king was super super bad but the desert king was I think smart
Let's gooo!
2:21 the potato war reminder?
LMFAO 16:20 *You been talking them up here like you are Jim Jones* Has to be the funniest and saddest thing you could ever say!!
I am a jungle supporter. LONG LIVE THE KING
Im one of the people who played in this contest
i just loved how he corrected himslef from "THE BEST POTATO FARMER" to "WAIT...... THE SECOND BEST POTATO FARMER" that felt funny :D
Lest gooooo desert win.....jungle so bad
The fact that it wasnt an Aztec temple. It was a maian temple
The desert
Yo silver now you should do this again but do it with 4  different biomes : The warped Forest, The crimson forest,  and 2 custom biomes
Desert village
I would love a  a minecraft moded civilization Like vampires vs werewolves vs vampirehunters vs humans
this was the best i would love some more content like this silver
3:09 oh yeah daddy zhongli :v
2:11
all off you're videos are awesome!!!
Squid kid?The one who got defeated by technoblade in potato farm?😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
I love minecraft civilization videos
Squid kid casually trying to reclaim potato #1 rank, But Techno Never Dies!!
I liked jungle but if there 2nd leader would have strategized more and gathered more materials and landed sneaky attacks
I wanted artic to win
Cool!
o7 to starkiller
YESS!! SILVER You are a masterpiece and your videos are amazing you rule is😃😀☺💙

DESERT WAS THE BEST AND JUNGLE KING WAS TRYING TO BE HERO BUT HE WAS A ZERO

You should make a new kit adea: 1:builder kit IT can make placing block for 11 BLOCKS and placing block more faster 2:range kit when you spawn you get 30 Arrow and 1 bow It can charge bow more faster and can shoot more far away 3: assassin kit it can run 2x faster that warrior kit and if you make a sword it Will always have sweeping edge
this entire video was a roller coaster of every single possible emotion a human can experience
zombie abstract was the real MVP
I was hoping jungle will win from the start
It was very fun  And how do I join this vids?
Is it possible to play that Civilization game on bedrock?

Genshin impact more like no woman impact
God bless everyone and have a good day
I_am_squid_kid was mentioned in Technoblade
Sequel
king eyes is litterlary become hitler murdering civilizations I mean "murder everything" sounds like "conquer everything" and "leave no survivors" thats full murder in my opinion    Im not gonna give a dam about the people who conflicted this opinion its just a opinion
great video silver but i think the jungle king was his fault why they lost
Second best farmer lol
I like arctic more cuz their town is so beautiful
https://youtube.com/channel/UCx00UJwz1a8CCeBNQF2BHyA
More pls, I liked this a lot
Superb video  bro . Please make more videos on civilization 🙏🙏
Just wanted to say I just found this genre, and also dont care about minecraft but this is better than Magic Gums or whatever and by far the best and most interesting minecraft war
Your consistency and quality of videos never disappoint! Keep up the good work🙂
This is one of the most insane videos i have ever watched. Props to you silver!  Also i was rooting jungle at first then few minutes in after star was dethrown, and the civilization was being evil, i rooted desert
Youtuber: sponsors genshin impact The comments: I KNOW/PLAY GENSHIN IMPACT BLABLBALA PRIMOGEMS PRIMOGEMS
This was actually a really interesting sociological study
Make second part
5:50 I CAN FEEL MY POWAH
why do i see always panda killing in these video if it keeps happening I will unsub
Snow civilization and favorite player the The one who killed the last jungle player
This is such a masterpiece I enjoy watching these type of contents I wish I was in one of your vids only If I had minecraft... But still I like the ending part where the zombie finished off the last jungle member
Jungle village bruhhhh, chaotic!!!! but content is content lmao
Really good video want more I want to join the next one sorry for not on what ever you said in video but play let me join
Ayo 1 man army
I think the jungle kingdom could've been the strongest if they had Star rule the kingdom but Ize control the military. I would've had Ize get the double health and elytra but give the crown to star so it would be star's job to make sure the miners and farmers can keep the resources flowing and properly allocated and Ize could focus on making the warriors ready for pvp. Ize would have the extra mobility and health that he would need as military's leader but wouldn't have to worry about revolts since the people already liked star also star could advise him on how to move the military like don't mobilize during a blood moon and instead gear up or have a better strategy than just rush in when your greatly outnumbered
Lol the zombie is the mvp
I already downloaded genchin impact
Lol actually awesome video
E
This Show's How One Blood Thirsty Kingdom Can Begin Chaos So Fast
I love these kind of vids!
I remember you speed silver
More!!!
Yes I wanna see
desart RULES
ABSTREKT BOOM YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
I like the artic
Im proud of desert
Pls make a second one
Let me in one vid
Squidkid watching this: (;-;)
If you don't think Silver should make a sequel to this you're just waffling mate.
Ais bikas is spa sas
Silver: Lead by the best potato farmer- wait I read that wrong- the second best potato farmer, Squid kid  Me: OH MY GOD OOOOOOOO MY MAN JUST GOT ROASTED, YOU DIDNT HAVE TO GO THERE MY GUY
If star did not die the jungle could win since no war involved with their civilization
ize lowkey kinda annoying
Its so worth to wait Iloved this
More civilization with cool mods
I'm proud that say that I'm one of your og subscribers
Dessert they good lol
I laughed so much when he said  secong best potato farmer
Make another one plz plz plz plz plzzzzzzzzz
and its all ur fault
25:06 ah yes  thats a creeper alright
This is so good
It sucks that the desert had their work done by the Jungle and Arctic people. They just stood there, getting more advanced while Jungle just eliminated the rest of the competition.
Desert
I wanted star to be king he sounds like a good king there should be a part 2 but star tell them that he got killed
You should, but do more players!!!!!
L squid Boi
Try this again but try this with a few mods and maybe try qitha few other kingdoms that would historically destroy eachother
Minecraft  I have time Now to raid Episode time We will raid Along time Raid in minecraft
feel bad for squid kid even silver uses that joke
love the video here’s a new sub
WOW 40MIN VIDEO LETS GOOOO
I wonder what other events were planned, it’s too bad that the jungle wasn’t more organized, if they would have prevented the artic players from escaping the sneak attack on desert would have been more successful
Oh sorry second best potato farmer -Silver
Sequel! Sequel! Sequel!
The MVP of the video is that Damn Zombie player.
Honestly the zombie abstrekt kill was pretty epic Imagine being a king and get killed by a zombie
so many YouTubers lol
Just like real life.
i really like artic kingdom
Who went for jungle
"...and the best potato farmer, sorry I read that wrong, second best potato farmer" *slam* *EMOTIONAL DAMAGE*
Pls give more of this
Part 2 please
I always was Desert Team, on the start i was like: Bro, this will get pretty good because these guys seem like players that have very good Gamesense.  And i was right!
This felt like one of those movies where the main character looses all of his stuff to the bad guy so he allies with the unexpected and then wins
I liked how jungle just stormed article and demolished them
World , downloaded link pls
Zombie sheeeeeeeeeeeesh
When I see the sponsor is genshin impact push p push p push p for pause push p push p push p push p
frick he sponsored genshin
Mann silver is the best YouTuber
Do you let bedrock player play
"Second best potato farmer" Just ended my guy's career
Jungle
Jungle
my fav was arctic
I kind of hate the new jungle king ngl
you should do another one of these but with youtubers
The second best potato farmer🤣damn that hit hard
TECHNOBLADE IS THE BEST POTATO FARMER
That was so fun to watch and tbh the desert civilization deserves the win ggs
The guy who killed starkiller is stupid
do squeal with clownpierce
Psalms 49:15-19 16 Be not afraid when a man becomes rich,     when the glory of his house increases. 17 For when he dies he will carry nothing away;     his glory will not go down after him. 18 For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed     —and though you get praise when you do well for yourself— 19 his soul will go to the generation of his fathers,     who will never again see light.
your content is good but not your upload schedule
Reminds me of MagicGum videos
The diamond armor guy from the Jungle was insufferable. Outstanding video though!
It was a good video until i found out that it was sponsored by Genshin Impact. It was good after that tho
Please do more dis was entertaining
This Looks Very hard to do.
hey silver could you make a 100 days as a end shapeshifter next
the best- wait i read that wrong the *second* best potato farmer in minecraft LMAOO
The genshin music in the back XD
me:who watchs an genshin impact ad in the beggining of the video and another one from silver
Love
I liked the desert tenple
I love how I_am_a_squid_kid was considered the REDONDO D best potato farmer. Only if he beat Techno in the war.
Hallo
I love that he forgot Squid Kid is 2nd Place on Potato Farming
Boo I love jungle
bruh come on jungle!!
Lets go silver
Omg its ima_ squidkid from technoblade potato war
I am playing pocket edition can i join your events with that?
1st Place: Artic 2nd Place: Desert 3rd Place: Jungle  Edit: *That’s just my opinion on favorites.*
Watch how Ize says he's better than starkiller but as soon as he takes power the jungle declines. He really said "Starkiller would have wait on the  Island for the others to fight, then get slaughtered" odly enough, that strategy beat Ize's kill all strategy in the Jurassic event
The warrior looks like a mandalorian 😂
https://youtube.com/channel/UCWNq31M-q8FwerAugm7KuuA
I feel like ize is the false king and all he wants is power with his lacky partners its like lion king all over again if i was in this challenge i would be sussing ize out and i would be a warrior just to kill ize
You get 9 mill pls I will help
I dont have Twitter I love your vids I'm sad
I havent played minecraft since 2016,but for some god forsaken reason i love watching these civilization videos
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
The Jungle King was a terrible leader and horrible at team work.
literally worldbox in minecraft
Am sad for the artic THEY DID NOTHING WRONG
It Was insane I was routing for desert because my home land is a desert pls do a Series I love these kind of videos
did u froget techno he is the only patato farmer
We need something like this to happen in bedrock!
ITS SO COOL!PART 2 PLEASE?
The jungle loss was on them tbh....as the defect said, he was just cocky and thats what cost him his head...bad leadership tbh
Yes more plz
Ummm no 😁🤣🤣🤣🤣
As an endgame Genshin Impact player, the genshin impact sponsor was unexpected but welcome. The Liyue battle music was so unexpected
Yo can I play on ps4
Sequel with a handful of the same people
Only a thechno fan will understand squid kid
ZSPDKSC3V8V5
Desert desert
Wow
amazing video but why would anybody pick a kit other then the warrior if the warrior is just a miner, farmer, super solider while the others are just normal players
This was the most exciting and thrilling video! The editing was golden. I would definitely wanna see more videos like this 🔥🔥🔥
Pls make more of these kinds of videos
This guy is a god.

All the wholesome christmas people in the arctic got eliminated and left only the strong ones left

SpeedSilver when are you going to do hypixel skyblock videos? :(
I liked desert idk why
DESERT
The pandas win
IZE I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
Ize got one win and thought he had it in the  bag lol
Aztec, Inca, and Maya be like
I wanted the jungle kingdom to win to
When I saw squid kid I was like nooo noooo then where techno
I am the only one who knows he is using mario music in the start
The best mincraft vid good job sliver 👍👍
Why the fuck did he assassinate star. Legit he was already king with no competition, AND hes down a player. Ize didnt even think about winning, he just wanted to be leader
RIP Panda.
i love the jungle empier
I would have done dropped ize when he was trying to get power from the most gear I could make a trap and hes dead I'm lava his stuff gone
This is acient china all over again lol its a fullout war
16:19 like your jim jones damn 🤣
artic was the best and suep should have been the leader
i liked the artic guys and to u jungle selfish king why u had to be the one who was that power hungry 3 netherite items and this damn hidding of the enchants u could let evryone enchant u may would have got more powerful gear at alll
Can u make it more balanced btw great video
Silver I loved this PLS MAKE MORE
Leaders are full netheright
Go back to skyblock you were the best skyblock youtuber
Insane video!
Perfect make more off these
Minecraft, but it’s also Fire Emblem: edit: I can't spell, I swear I have brain damage.
Guys subscribe to silver he puts a lot of effort on his videos and the reason he barely posts videos it because it takes a very long time to make the video so subscribe like to silver to make him happier :) it really helps him and he clearly deserves it
Nice combo!
I'm sad that starkiller wasn't elected. He was the best choice, and if he was the leader we could hawe an interasting diplomacy plot. Plus the other guy was stupid as a rock and a really bad leader. Funny thing he sounded like a bully
I want a part 2. This is really good!
jungles king was so mean . (ize)
I liked starkiller :c
the jungle nation was my fav
This video so beautiful and perfect   I love too see more
Bro 28:09 Was Like The battle of Normandy but instead of No-no people It Was mobs
First death ez
i was loving jungle team i was hyped but they lose :(😫😕☹🙁
Jungle is my personal fratiote
After star died I hoped for the ones who planned his downside would pay with lots of suffering
Our today sponsor: genshin impact We don't even need a face reveal we know what he looks like
Cool
I like this new trend its almost like 100 days in minecraft
Nice vid! I love this concept and I started watching someone called spoke. He made these kinds of videos and I'm so happy other people are doing it.
Love the super Mario music
today's my birthday your video made it even more special thanks!!!
i bet if star was the jungle king jungle would win
The zombie player truly was the best character there, it literally took out the king of jungle (sort of)
Nothing to add.
Wouldn’t be suprised if Technoblade commented to correct you
I loved this vidéo it was awesome !! My favorite Civilation was Totaly the Ice one ... They were ... **CHILL** 🤡 (no yeah they were Pretty cool and too bad they're city was voted the last one )
Silver you should make more of these kinds of content i enjoyed it very well and i was routhing for desert to win and they did and wanted the jungle team to lose cuz of theire routhlessness
I liked the desert civilisation from the start. They had good infrastructure and a mesa mountain to give them high ground. They also had good strategizing from the leader and general. Tbh, not surprised they won. Well done, my guys!
guys dont be persuaded he just has an accent  - some guy in silvers tournement
This was sooo good  nice vids but please upload frequently u are my fav mc utuber

Jeez this water was a banger I liked jungle most though
I love jungle
I like jugle
Not even kidding this is the best Minecraft video to ever exist !!!
genshin is mid ly  silver
Jungle had the most resources while dessert has almost none so jungle got cocky because they have advantage on resources while dessert had to go through more to just get a little resource but with theyre hard work they won
This was amazing
you are rly nic e
Well done on only putting in 5 ads to your video
how do you enter in these types of videos (civilization videos) edit: i found it
My favourite yourubers under my favourite youtuber's comment.....A DREAM COME TRUUUUUUU
haha nice mario music
Sure the jungle did well and killed nearly all of the players but they leader was too cocky he just wanted to ambush and kill he didn’t have anyone focusing on anyone which instead just swung his sword at everything he should of came up with a strat just because you have op armour and weapons and the king class doesn’t make you unkillable
The Jungle kingdom reminded me of Napoleon and i was with them the whole time.
The drama makes this more entertaining
yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss desert win!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing
If star killer got to king it would have been different
Susy baka
Bro this is amazinggg <333
BEFORE 1 MILL CLUB!!!
Jungle
Bruh
i hate ize
jungle kings ego go brrrrrrrr
I’m going to stop the video 5 minutes before the video is over.
More pls.more this was do cool you NEEED. To keep going plssss
I ,loved this but a quick question: if you did this again would mobil players be able to join?
Jungle civilization is in so huurry so they lose
Never say squid is best potato farmer
2:15 why is this person placing diamonds back just to mine it again??
It has been a month since your last upload I thought u got sick or somthing
Wow plz make it again plz 🙏
The mario music I love it.
I am a sad breath of the wild player.
This look fun isn't it?
Ngl, Jungle was the most fun team to watch. Not for the wars or stuff, they all just vibin and actually being vikings was neat
A lot of youtubers variety in the comments
I love to the Jungle
Bruh I hate evaaaaaaaa flipper
I bite jungle
Make this again it is so good
Artik
Poor squid kid his title was stolen by a nerd pig
The three kingdoms, Jungle, Desert and Arctic. They all lived in peace, until Ise was elected king.
dude great job, can i participate one of these, and also, you could try to get more players and make more kingdoms, were people can make clans, and monetary systems, the resource for the coin of the world would need to ba an item not that rare, but not that common, you could increse the gold, and it would make it perfect, but yeah hat would be a good idea, so yeah
OML I WANT MORE BRO!!!!!
This is more like in  a movie but in minecraft
Genshin sucks soooooooooo p2w
Desert was the best
please make more kind of these video
I didnt like it please put 100 days videos or minecraft custom story mods or manhunts please 🥲
I want to join da discord my name is MarvelFan123 aka Jude

Silver the best potato farmer is not squid kid its obviously the one and only technoblade because they literally went to war just for farming potatoes
6:45 is that trixy block's temple??

I really like arthic players they all just team working so good yeah i like arthic team

I wanted arctic to win and didn’t want jungle to win
jungle
SEQUAL
i like the jungle
I never like your video before but this is fantastic
can you give the map u used in this video?
techno better potato farmer

the jungle before ize became king star was a better king.
JUNGLE
2:20 Technoblade :)
Jungle
Arctic winner of hards
Sequel!!
Go king
Amazing silver just amaazing
When you’re learning about the Aztecs in school: *I don’t think they’re gonna make it back*
Mines is The Artic nation
You could do the same but with like more ores,armors dimensions.
why there's among us
love the vids, keep them coming :)
Rooted for jungle civilization if they would not have political issues then for sure they would have won this
Bru
I would have absolutely loved to see jungle win lol
This was Awesome!
Artic
*have you ever heard of genshin impact?*
Ohhh this is sooo coolll
lol i just had to replay and watch that incredible "ooh genshin impact, hell yeah baby" at 9:08 😂👌 edit: and i love this kind of video keep up the good bro 😆👍
Macke One with More grops
Yeah cow was killed by mystory player😂
I like jungle
I wanted the desert civilization to win because of the act of bringing their undead teammate by boat. I also wanted the jungle one to lose because of their king. And I wouldn't mind if the artic won because they did a good job (win without joining the desert team)
Please do more of these I'm interested of these type of vid I'll sub to you!
yo I was watching this again and xnestorio joined?!
If I was in the vid I'd be a farmer since I'd been a Minecraft farmer miner and a builder my whole life lol
Jungle was too ruthless but props to Ize tbh for making this much more interesting
what about the artic
If star was still alive, the jungle would have stayed passive like desert  and maybe won
More
hi can i be in a civilization videos but i don't have minecraft i can't afford it
Desert
Im sort of mad the jungle lost I was going for them as well
jungle was good but not the king
I rooted for the Desert
that's soo freaking nice!!! i love you video bro
What to learn from this video : Be strong but don't be too cocky, Jungle was strong but got cocky while Snow just wasn't that strong. While desert got good loot for a lotta their players and didn't rush too much and thus won
Always happy seeing a new video after a month or so ^0^ I was honestly rooting for the Arctic team I rooted for both Arctic and Desert after the argument of the 2 jungle people fighting for king
Need more plz . This was amazing
Jungle kinda tude and have no teammate to me
Would've been soo cool if the last jungle guy somehow instead of rushing just grinded a lott and singled out and killed the desert people?
I liked the desert but I preferred the jungle with the star killer screw the other guy
Let me join too
yooooooooooooo perfect vid pls do more :)
poor the girl that died by the enderman :(
HAhahahah   no u did not say: *wait i read tht wrong SECCOND best potato miner* hahahah he got rekt xd

I gotta say, I loved the jungle but grew to hate it after the king started playing mean. After that, I was team desert.

I love the Mario Music
From start to finish was it an absolute blast waching this hop you do another one of theese events  Silver <3
He be using Genshin music, it’s the music that starts if you fight someone or something in Liyue, 6:10 - 6:33.
This was so fun!

The jungle king is the worse ill remember his name

i actually thought that jungles gonna win
the legend is back
I wanna see a sequal love u
This is such an cool idea and I have seen other players do this but its always interesting to watch
14:57 silver sais: you failed sliding to the left. *tries to fly away, hits a roof* Hahah.
I have watched most of your videos including this on I know you are busy But can you think about making a bedrock version of this
great vid
Man you put a lot of effort into this video and it late off what a beautiful     video
More video like this please
Press F for squid kid, Or L? XD
Sequal
Sequal
loved this video. I was 100% rooting for the jungle civilization.
If y'all really pay attention on the starting player joining thingy, you'll see "Technoblade joined the game"
that was so good
I've been waiting for a month for a upload ☺️
Ok
One more
Jungle is best
Ize : This guy is a traitor.  Also Ize : *being the traitor*
This was so amazingly good, ive never before liked civilization vods, but this was great
IMAGINE A SINGLE ZOMBIE ENDING YOUR NATION LMAAOOOO
2:23 ya u better watch ur mistake buddy
Long live ize
I love how many things he mispronounced when he did the genshin map
Sage :(((( I hoped jungle win
Now that's what i called "The revenge of the undead"
I liked the snowy tundra and jungle a lot they're really friendly and nice
my favorite city was the arctic
When the jungle people crossed the river, it was kinda like D-Day from WW2
woooh genshin inpact hell yeah baby hahahaha..
I'm a OG
Yep my guy still remeber his skyblock journey
Jungle
I like the mario music
It's for bedrock?
The man who dies to the creeper sacrificed himself to save the others
please make a manhunt video
I realy like the artic one !
I wish we could have seen how Ize died since his invasion failed after he talked himself up so much.
why dident ice win they where the best (so peacefull)
If he actualy make one more of these vid and 1 of the player will be a wandering trader that will be very cool
SUS, AMOGUS
This is like rise of kingdoms
THAT'S THE MARIO SOUND
The desert was the best, they didn't jump onto other nations and try to kill them like that bozo leader from the jungle, however they still geared up enough to stand a good chance, and they used their desert well to win. I really liked that ending with the zombie killing the last guy!
sooooo much youtuber XNestorio, Painful, Speedsilver?, Preston.
Is you do mcpe
Desert take the W
The guy on the dessert kingdom kinda sounds like dream.
This was so stressfull....im gonna root for the dessert army       Uhm im happy.... I kinda didn't like the jungle king
Oh yea Naruto
i love civilization videos
Have anyone noticed he used Genshin theme music
I love this Video please make more of this videos!
Big fan
Do one for bedrock version
The jungle have the worst leader
This is really good:))
That's soooooo EPIC 😆
thancks
I was rooting for squid kid bruh
Squid kid 2nd best potato farmer Technoblade my leagacy is protected
i found your old channel "Speed silver" now i know from what you have that nickname
Hahahah squid kid from technoblade vid bro what
I feel like ive seen this on a diffrent channel a few months ago probably because i have
i have waited months for this and its great
From the beginning ize messed up.
That part when the jungle king died was my favorite
Rise of kingdoms
my favorite character is Sleepy_Biscuit with the iconic lines at 21:10 , "Are you? Are you sorry? Like, really sorry?"  She's so right. There is no sorrow nor regret harbored within a malevolent god.
Ize was a ruthless leader jeeez... xD
Can u make a resident evil one please
1 artic player survive XD
I like desert because of the zombie help during the war between desert and artic vs jungle
That irish lad was an absolute dictator!
Bro the last time I watched silver he was at 400k subs well done on getting 1.7 mil
Sub to this channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI02lUkgv9qJiBjehuEopgA (not mine)
Arctic was the best
You are very very very Nice youtuber :)🙂🙂🙂
peace is good
The jungle was the best, the reason is lower soldier and good strategy, they killed much than half of desert guy, and the last reason is artic join the desert
how can the jungle king do this
Jungle and inv cornal racer 203
I like the ice because its just like ice cream 🍦 😂😂
People in the comments been criticizing Ize(the jungle king), but deep down we all know that if Ize wouldnt have been in the video, this video wouldn't have been THIS fun. So props to Ize for the strategies.
This has THE BEST politics
2 parttt
The jungle leader is like Hitler but a bit calmer.
Please Do A Part Two PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... please
Lol I’m playing Genshin well watching this no cap
Nice video bro and look how much grind he is doing so just subscribe to him
You are the man who is going to be a great yotuber
can you make 100 days agian
MORE MORE MORE
Yes
Jungle 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😏
Jungle
Jungle definitely is a tyrant country but still lost
SECOND PLS
#jungle power
Awesome work loved the video I was expecting jungle to win but that’s how it goed :D
I liked jungle
i liked artic
I voted for Jungle
Bro love from India  You are awesome
Desert should have won the build comp, they had more limited resources
That was so cool and funny, please do more but in the nether or the end.
35:52 LOL
32:42 im so sorry for him :/ He was so nice
I love this type of videos
This is the best video so far I watched
Great video. Does anyone remember when silver did all those minecraft op videos?
BROOO I MISS YOU you was like disappearing for 4monthes
I liked the most the jungle
The most i liked the artick civilization
I like these kinds of minecraft videos! We need more! You should have a netherworld faction as well. These guys start in the nether, where its dangerous and resources are few. Then after some time, they can build a portal to access the mainworld and join the fight against the 3 other nations. Maybe the 3 nations will team up against them, or not
Subribe gays it's very nice video
Best video yet keep going forward silver
I laki da mo's da des
Jungle is the best
I did not expect the desert people to win
Good vid
Wow
I liked everyone execpt that noob that tought he was better king than starkiller
Jungle biome: WAAAAAAR arctic and desert: frens
Do this as a sequence please
Idk how u plan these things but it's like you planned these things like 5yrs before
Would've turned out different if Starkiller was crowned king
How u make this plz make a tutorial on this...
Jungle I love that team
I wish i could but i don't have minecraft i would be a really good teamate
I... These 100 days are Awesome, cool and unique  And I Absolutely love them  Keep up the great work  ❤💙💖
This was amazing
Sadly for squid kid, he couldn't surpass techno in skyblock, at least he did it in your challenge
Green my favourite is green
The jungle king was rushing a lot into battles
Yooo
Never knew this was a thing! It’s a AMAZING video tho, keep up the amazing work silver!!!!!
desert
the among us kill there was the funniest thing
silver your insane i liked this video a loot and you asked which nation i liked so it is desert because in combat and desert pyramid!
New trend beginning be like
dang i was ruiting for the jungle😭😭😭😪😖
I like the part when the amount us died
Please new ep of hypixel skyblock After nether update
One more video of culture..:-0
izec for life
i feel sorry for the arctic kingdom i have empathy o7 for arctic
Finnally you create a new video
Im really happy I got to play! Thanks for the experience silver!

THIS IS SICK
ppls do make a sequel
This is an interesting Minecraft event like the other minecraft video .
Where techlogy and economy
Bro you should do more videos like this i like your videos and everyone else like them as well and when is next video coming
Bro so good
Yes plz make video like this 👍🏻👍🏻
can we talk about how Liyue battle music suits this video very much LMAOO
Sequel sequel
Desert
Awesome work, this is one of the best 100 days civilisation videos there are!
If you appreciate silver making hard videos like this like and subscribe his channel
The jungle kingdom were so cool, using tactics to kill everyone. But it is annoying that they hit t3amed by both other army’s because they were the first to Attack. I find whoever is the first to attack, even if really powerful will lose as the other teams wil just join forces
I liked the Jungle king in one way because first of all he was good in pvp then second is that he attacked arctic at the right time. But I think that going for desert was a bit too greedy
Yes but you kan do it pocket edition
The first potato farmers nevermind 2 nd
I want to join how can I join
I feel so dissapointed when you sponsered Genshin Impact, unsubbing
ELOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nice
Walls 3
amung gus
The 1.7 million with so less videos is well deserved and justified Every video has the quality of a thousand
22:00 that is why i am afraid of public speaking
Jungle was by a big margin the best
Jungle team all day R.I.P
More
this looks really fun
I loved it it was like a movie plz make more
Jungle
Suepp
Didn’t magic gum already do this
Jungle civilization was the best
The second best potato Boi was here
Let's go is aawayals wanted tjeis in can't evaan s p eel cause Ami so happleyn ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️😗😋😙🥰😙🤪🤩🙂
I liked the desert kingdom since the zombie chasing the jungle king made me laugh so hard.
I Love your Content it takes time but it is REALLY  GOOD
Squid kid ??? BRUHH
THIS VID WAS SOOO 🔥
Hey @Silver, i have a question. Maybe if u gonna make another like that competition where do i get informations about it? Because i really like ur content and i appreciate ur hard work. U could do it with origins mod.
"Lead by the best potato farmer, wait i read that wrong. Second best potato farmer..."  Technoblade would be so proud
Very good tournaments
Niceeee
idk why the jungle nation think fighting two nation simultaneously is a good idea
bro you are so good at this keep up the good wotk man
Try making civilisation but there are morps and origins and some good mods. (Mabye give peapole the ability to evolve your morph and origin
love the fact that those jungle villagers argue so much about the king. Good work Silver
karma
This was well worth the wait!
Desert losers jungle winners cuz I hate desert
I still don't like the jungle civilization
One more!!!
i like the jungle guys but the leader was bad
who else is happy that ize and saitama died and they got karma put #izesaitamasucks and #starkillerdabestttt
Its crazy how every video of his has 1m views or more, other then this one but that will change in a few days.
I was rooting for the desert from the beginning bec iam from egypt
King ize is a kind of mean but he is a good and smart leader
That was a do cool video
Amazing
Bro you do rellay hard work for us just to epic video
I was hoping for arctic to win but when things looked too bad for them to win I wanted to desert win because I thought they were pretty kind too like arctics. I just didn’t like jungles leader. He was bit too agressive in my opinion. Ps. Incredible video🔥❤️
I Liked The Jungle Civilization Is Cooler But They Lose So... Boooooo For Desert Civilization!!
howw the hell you come up with these ideas. Bossé
It's so nice, that all the OG Hypixel Skyblock youtubers are here.

In all honesty my character woulda been loyal to Starkiller but after he died she would have immediately defected to the Desert and warned them of the war and power mongery of Ize and helped them to suit up ;p i was hoping that jungle would lose and the Arctic noob lost because u don't win with outright betrayal of the people who literally just accepted u into their home ;p
Desert
I would like the jungle if the other one was king bit now i think is the desert
PLS MOR3
Maybe u should upload more?
Can anyone tell the background music at 26:20
Let's go husk zombie goooo...
that was AWESOME CANNOT WAIT FOR ANOTHER VID
I supported Desert from the start lol But really good video.
5:00 he gave his life to safe the rest
The jungle team's leader deserved to die cuz i feel like he was being a jerk ngl. Like a true leader wouldn't convince everyone to vote for them and let the people vote and just because you have the best gear, doesn't mean you have the best leadership.
Bruh Silver is using genshin background music in this vid
Bro love your 100 days videos
Uuuuh how do you join an event like this
The players corpse who escaped soul was still loyal to desert also pin me
Why is this not getting a lot of views this deserve more views >:O
Make a sequel !!!
Now make this vid and make theam of fire, thunder and water⚔️
LOVED THAT<33 PART 2 PLZZ
jungle on top tbh
Khooobi🤙🏻🤙🏻
He know naruto
Epic edditig again pls this is sooooo goood
Minecraft? More like Minewar am i right?
Me hearing genshin impact keeps letting me think that I’m getting attacked XD
Kinda wish you still made skyblock vids

finally I've been waiting for and hello I'm from Indonesia
Holy youtube why is there so many youtubers comment here?
Pog! :O
wish i was in silvers video if i did get in i dont have a minecraft account <:(
Greediness can lead to your demise as what the jungle king did
I liked jungle
I thought ur dead
2:21 you didn't have to do squid like that
You killed the video.
sequel
It was SOO obvious that abstrekt the zombie warrior was the main character XD
I like the Artic better.
sorry but Genshin inpact sucks as
Poor Artic :(
The desert civilization I liked the most
Why ize being kind of mean though. Not trying to be mean but why kill the cow.
jungle my fav
Btw nice vidoe!
The jungal
I hate desert player
this was the best thing ive watched
dessert: my fav simple jungle: worst it was my fav but ice is the problem artic: amogus
This was extremely awesome! I also wish to play with you but the problem is I don't have minecraft.. I play in cracked version :(
Jungle should be the one with the worst loot and Artic with the best loot!
HELP GO GENSHIN COMBAT MUSIC
Sus is my friends in skol
I was rooting for jungle :(
WoooooHhhh I CaN FeEl My PoWeRrrr👹
Sivler is op
Sequel plz
IM SO HYPED WHEN I SAW THIS THAY I CAN SCREAM SWEAR SO LOUD
I liked the Jungle Kingdom the most, until the evil cunt guy took over
This was fun we want another one of these
I am Impressed With this  Hats OFF SILVER! KEEP IT UP!
Plz do this again this was so fun to watch
My fav was the artic
Painful silver i have goodie trades for you 64 coal=full diamond gear make a choice
Jungle
op🔥
i have a challange for u servive 100 days with me
I really like the artic but they got killed
cool video
I heard liyue's battle theme o__o this video is probably like Cryo Vs Dendro Vs Pyro Or Sneznayah(Ice) Vs Sumeru(Jungle) Vs Natlan(Desert)
tbh I was cheering for the desert, even thought they didnt really have that much screen time in the vid, they still won! Congrats to them!!
It really says something about this guys content that the top five comments are all from famous youtubers
i also thought that the desertb will win cauz in clown peirce vedio he was in desert and won somtimes u just need hope
Great video, but I hoped that the jungle kingdom won
i liked arctic rip old king of jungle
I loved the jungle village
This is why this man deserves subs. He’s one of the few people who puts actual effort into the content.
Abtrekt zombie mvp
Little did the desert know their were still two civilizations..... Nether and End
Anybody who sees this hope you have a great day
Insane video
Next nation war plese from india
This man became a power-hungry a dictator an still lost lmao so much for acting so though
They would have made things to defend themselves like underground tunnels, powdered snow block traps  and would groups to work in shifts🙂😊
Man got power-hungry became a dictator an still lost lmao
I HATE IES
Thank you silver for new video after many days and I am requesting u for a new video like this thx mah boi
this was sooo cool to watch!
2:20 Oh my god the roast...Technoblade would have been proud.
you ish and magicgum should do a super civ event/ also the whole the best potato farmer in minecraft oh wait second best when talking about squid kid
This video is so intertaining i love it
✨🌝♥️OP
You never fail to disappoint. I can't be surprised when you upload epic vids, but this is another level!
Do it again
YOUR BACK- THANK YOU :DD
I love the jungle one
Yow, ize is just a bad leader on their region just because he has full diamond doesn't make him awesome what's awesome is that leadership is the best of all no matter what danger they will go through and knows what is right for his region honestly and sorry but you are a terrible leader you shouldn't be the king.
SQUID BOY GET OUTTA HERE CAUSE TECHNO NEVER DIES AND HE IS COMING
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into the  content for us..❤️🚀🚀😭
Alternate title:irl=minecraft
Im betting for the arctic to win
desert
wait a minute Im a squid kid crops
Finally Your Video Arrived 😁
Its an epic video !!! Make one more Video similar to this with same players i liked the personality and attitude of the players. Waiting for your new video always !!
Finally the wait was worth it....
this is just like history  but BETTER!
The genshin background music, relaxing so relaxing
i want a sequael
Squid kid is still alive
Like the reference to techno beating squid kid in the potato war. U should of brought techno
I chowed the desert civilization
Well, I still like Artic Kingdom most. Although they lost first, but they have a very good plan to grown their civilization be better
Please make more videos like this. This is amazing. I liked the Artic and Desert team more than the Jungle team.
Chungledon sound technoblade
LESGOO THE ZOMBIE GOT THE FINAL KILL
VERY COOL!
I like this kind of vids
FFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK I WANTED JUNGLE TO WIN
Desert civilization is my favorite
I like your video 👍👍
I liked the Arctic
THE GENSHIN BGM LMAO I LOVE IT
Please make more of these loved it !!!!!!
Jungle is the best team
I need more of this
More videos like this
Would love to see part 2
This is wonderful video
silver: until i founded the most cursed statue ever someone: wait is that among us? silver: **laughs**
I hate eyes🤬
SEQUEAL!
Desert kingdom is my favorite
I feel like I’m hem having technos arch enemy on there team is a bit unfair
I liked the artic civilization they had sprit
I want more of these man...
I loved the dude with a crossbow after the ravage thing on the artic "YOU MAKE ME SICK, YOU KNOW THAT?!"
bro wernt you a skyblock youtuber or is that your original channel
I would dig under ground gather players and start a underground Colonie
@ technoblade Squid is back
epik !
I wish for part 2 pls 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌that's raw man that's raw
“Rapid as Wildfires" from Genshin Impact at 6:00 lol😁
He started as a villain ended as a hero, *the jungle king ize*
arctic
they respawnd becouse i saw tha dessert people go up
bro u don't deserve 1million subs  u deserve 20 million subss i told my my friend ur channel and he loved it and  yesterday i was thinking that why silver is not uploading videos and today only u uploaded video
dessert cheated
That was awesome,I loved the jungle village and there ruthless king
Theis is so entertaining
Love the work great work..
We could really see the amount of effort you put on to your videos, it was worth for us to wait...
Hey silver! I love the editing and the effort put into this video and I was wondering if you could let me know what software(s) you use for editing?
The jungle kingdom’s ruler made me so MAD… starkiller was so much better. A king doesn’t need to be skilled himself, they just need to be good at creating a great team energy so that everyone will work to their strengths
Abstrekt was a goat he got out his boat somehow and got a sword and went for the kill what a goat
OH HEIL SQUID_KID
This was a very good episoode!
And what if there was peace?
artic is full of susmas which sounds fun
Jungle was the best
Jungle Kingdom On Top Baby
the tune was from genshin impact during aztec temple
all i want to say is more
squid kid is second cuz the best one is technoblade
An absolutely amazing video. They always put a smile on my face 😊
i thought u r dead😅
No seriously, have you ever heard of genshin impact
Season 2!!!!
thnx for redeem code
Nice!
I saw suep's POV of this when he was editing it on stream, really cool to see the whole thing
"Second best potato farmer" lol techno's potato war reference I wonder why techno himself wasnt there
This was very entertaining.
Hi I’m a big fan
Sequel = Absolute BOMB of a video (pls do it i really want to see a sequel)
silver is thegod but he just let everyone do anything
The jungle civilization was too ruthless, they literally attack the desert players right away after attacking the artic, they should have return to their home base, get better gear and food also make a plan and THEN attack.
Silver honestly this looked  more like a movie and was very well made looking forward to more vids like these
0:09 **Technoblode joined the game** Me: **Visible Confusion**
I feel bad for artic they never wanted war or lore
Wow what a totally original idea.
There are so many players
You should have give him credit
The rath of techno is felt everywhere squid will not escape
This was a cool vid! I truly enjoyed it
Season 2 pls
This was a cool vid! I truly enjoyed it
You copied magic gum
Part 2 pls
Sequl plz
Sequl plz
jungle civilization
jungle civilization
I hated this video
Jungle
The amount of time and effort put into this is truly something to appreciate.
everyone: jumping and saying yaaaa woooo that one guy: genshin impact?! oh hell ya baby
I was rooting for the jungle lol  i kinda want to do something like this
So lead by the best potato farmer wait I read that wrong SECOND best potato framer in Minecraft
I wish the powerful jungle won...
*Desert King elected YAAAAAAAY *someone puts a tnt NOOOOOOO
Just started watching and already know it’s going to be epic cause the editing is on. Point
Genshin impact is gr8
Yessssss i love this it's like satisfying for me bc i love history lol omg I need to find.ore of these vids
ngl some people made me loathe them while others i practically died because they were hurt
Shape shifter next
Pfft you really did Squid Kid like that xD

those animatics in the intro segment were insane, big props to whoever did that - and may I ask, how were they done? Super inspiring work. hope it blows up man
You are the best silver
I would like to be a warrior🥲
i personally liked sUep the most, therefore i liked the artic he was a good leader.
8:39 Gives me heart attack
Ize as a Jungle leader sucks
Isn't this basically SMP earth?
*"let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into the  content for us.....!!!!🏆🏆🏆* 😻😘
AMAZING VIDEO, I LOVE IT.
I was hopping tundra would win
LMAO 2ND BEST POTATO FARMER SQUID KID XDDDDD
Do u know?: Silk touch + fortune makes u have more ore and keep doing that, u will have infinite diamonds:)   Edit: I never tried it before

Yes but make it in the Better End

Supes could've avenged all of Arctic if he finished off the Jungle king himself. Instead, he dies with him, such a strange decision.
This was soo good
The fun it thing is there’s no 100 days counter :D
this reminds me of when you played skyblock
Lol it's funny but. It's true second best potato farm the legend squidkid
I hate the dest I love  jungle
I feel Bad for the artic kingdom:(
I like the jungle

100 days in custom overworld
FIRST
Okay speed silver want my honest opinion I think that this video is basically you trying to rig it from  rise of kingdoms because that’s the only mobile game that allows you to pick whatever civilization you want to be in and I think you just trying to come up with your own name of the game trying to find some that isn’t related to something that’s a mobile game because there’s going to be 100s of people that will click bait and unsubscribe to you do you need a better name than that I don’t than that at least painful forestbono  xNestorio and sword  Videos are somewhat impressive and entertaining and I like those guys but you need a better name for this video OK speed silver good and thank you
Love it
Lol while i watching i think jungle win
that was kinda boring to watch
I would be a warer in the jungle
Another
I was bouta say Techno is the best potato farmer
i loved the jungle kin
Dude this was so good. I would love more videos like this
Privatefearless is in this i need videos from him
So COOOOOOLLLL!!!
I like the Mario background music when you are talking about the jungle region
WWwHHhOOoOOo!!!
Those of animation were the best
Silver I love your videos some much it makes my day whenever you upload
IZE IS A D**KHEAD
Best video I've ever watched. I don't usually comment on videos, but this one definitely deserved it! Amazing videos keep up the great work!!
I like  desert kindom it is peaceful

the zombie player is surely the MVP
He is turning into MagicGUm
Can you make more pls
If the jungle didn't kill their first king   The would win tbh
Bro did squid DIRTY
I liked the artic nation
Do overworld nether and end
I can't believe I missed this, and I love these kind of content!
I like more the jungle
no to the desert jungal ruals
This is where I’d follow you on Twitter  IF I HAD IT
i like the desert player it soo good like i more like as one as well on my world but ye the desert is the hotis in the world
This was amazing dude we want more
2:20 ...led by the best potato farmer...wait i read that wrong, second best potato farmer rip squid
would love to see another one of these!
Add mod
Hey mom, look! It’s me! On a different note, thank you speed for organizing this and helping me meet my new best friends! (That was me leaving and rejoining in the beginning chat because of my bad internet)
Desert was my favorite civilization
Yay finally got a video
I like jungles but i hate its leader
More pless
Yooo he's back
rip suep
aight this IZE guy is a B*tch  he just used power and threatened people to get his way
this episode was so good please upload an entire series on this.    I have been here since the beginning. at the times when silver played SkyBlock
I hope i have computer
yay desert won
Someone’s username is childCHOMPER 😆😆
I want to participate so bad
Lol, I’m so glad that jungle lost after the shit the power hungry guy pulled. After all the talk about winning them the war after having left them and trying to hide the enchant table from them so he would be unchallenged it was great to see him fall like a coward begging a former enemy for help as he ran away.
Yes do a sequel
Also make another civilization vid
What i liked most was the artic civilization
If I had a half decent computer I would like to play too
i liked desert the most no bias tho. certainly wasn't a humble farmer who built the silver statue
Love your videos
Bro I really did clutch that ending huh
More vids like this
ize the one true king
Please hurry on the 100 days on an island PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. And also make other factions: The plains biome, the nether biome, and the end biome. Imma help you with the custom structures
This was the best pls make more of these it was so intense and so good pls make more I beg you your the best my dude 🕶️🕶️🕶️🇺🇲🇺🇲
"yo guys I'm gonna elect myself, sounds good?" "No" That got me
I really like the thunder you put in, reminds me of the Hunger Games cannon sound when someone dies. Nice touch there buddy. 👌
NOOOO INFERNALLY
Nooooo SusMas tree lost
Zombie was the MVP
rozes are red 😁 violets are blue 😇 I liked my comment 🥺 cuz no one wanted to 😔
Starliller
It’s funny how he said that he was the great potato farmer and then he said wait I read that wrong technoblade reference
I have a genshin impact hoide
This editing is on point damn
Jungle
hejjo
Severse jungle right the king was so cocky
Hi
MORE CIVILIZATION VIDEOS PLSSSSS!!!!
The amount of effort, work, and skill that goes into these is incredible. It’s awesome to see it all come together
Star killer should've been king 😔
Defo likes jungle kingdom
Are there any mods in this? I assume there are some I’m just wondering. Also which ones were used?
couldent be better
i loved the desert and vated jungle just the king though
"Warrior" me: dream
Awesome video as always Silver!! Looking forward to your next masterpiece in the future!!
you must make smp
I hate jungle the king is toxic but I like artic there just enjoying their business but jungle invaded them
The arctic nation was my favorite because of their friendliness and Christmas spirit
Awesome work! Love all the animations >_<
Amazing Silver! Keep it up!
I hate jungle
5:51 *I can feel mah powah!*😆😆😆
I liked Arctic the most honestly. I really didn’t like Jungle
He made a potato war reference!!! I’m so happy :)
D for  Desert
Wait hold up i just realised that was ize lmfaooo i remember his uhcs
XNestorio was in this vid
I think I'm a squid kid is not very skilled jkjkjk
0:09 dude it’s xnestistorio
I would love to see like a season 2 of this with new civilisations idea
I would not survive this, either I'd get killed by a team mate or unlucky with mobs and ravines. not to mention the nether if that's possible in this world.
i love the artic nation
Me when I found out that squid kid was in: WAIT WHAT AN OLD RIVAL OF TECTO BLATE
Love all of the vids. You should do more of the civilization stuff, it's awesome
Gotta respect Ize as a warrior but, man that wasn't the way to go. An absolute fail as a leader, would've been better if he chose unity instead.
Pls 1 more this vidio i like the vidio
ayo finally silver sent a video. I've been waiting for new video to come out because his video is amazing
Star killer was actually a great leader Ize would have only been a decent a general but if they worked together instead of him being power hungry they probably would have won hands down.
This is Soo good
I was just trying to find a new video like this, perfect timing
best vid ever love this man
This idea that you made was already used multiple times + the events ingame line up... Coincidence???
Wow that was amazing
This was the best vid in this channel
Wasnt expecting this, but still excellent videos as always
great job can't wait for your new video :D
This was really fun to participate in :DD Great video
you know my favorite was the arctic then the desert because if I was on jungle I would jump in LAVA!!!
Y didn’t i get notification for this :( can i join without twitter
I knew there was something big coming up since you didn't upload for a bit.
IF YUOU SAW ODDYSSI YOU THE GOAT
Oof for ima squid kid
maturing is realizing ize was correct
Video is crazy i like artic civilization but desert civilization is really cool and at the end of the day we can agree they had very good bases
Who can agree whenever silver post our day gets so much better<3
I am so glad the jungle lost, their king was super toxic and deserved to lose for sure. People like that are nothing but bullies and should never have their ego fuelled or be let off for their actions.
Can I play with you my Minecraft username is jaydanG with a capital at the start and no spaces
yah
TEAM ARCTIC BABEY!!!
That one kid in the jungle got wayyy to angry about minecraft 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
WHY DID THE ARCTIC GET THE WORST DROP
Gotta credit magicgum man
1:50
Jungle was great but lost
The jungle king was so annoying bro
wow this was awesome i’ve never seen anything like this!! 💙👑
For some reason, the way silver talks makes this seem like a documentary.
I love how the whole video he's using genshin osts
Lets gooo the 2nd best potato farmer squid kid is here
You should do this again, but on bedrock so me and the bedrock homies can play.
Amazing production quality!
The jungle kingdom was the best and also you have a good videos and I like them!!
Squidkid got violated
this is super fucking high quality and I was also in it, Best video yet
I loved 🥰 this video!!!
I was rooting for jungle but now I was like jungle sucks and rooted for desert
I love how Abstract died at the beginning, was brought back to life as undead, was paddled all the way too the desert civilization, and at the last battle, he fought by his desert allies even after death, and technically won them the war.
Love the content
Love your channel sliver and also ize your a bad leader no offense
I defo didn't starve underground (_jadow_)
Your videos always make my day man. Keep up the awesome content! :D
Very proud of you my man, these are NOT easy to produce and you KILLED IT!!!
Artic
That was a fun event. Thank you
The true king of this video was abstrekt.
Silver when is the next 100days
It would be cool if there are cruel nether civilizations
Give me a sequel
sUeP was the true main character of this story, just to die at the end
I love this video   thx a lot, silver I enjoyed the video :)
I hated jungle civ. tbh.....and desert deserved the win!!
thx for bringing a video out i love your videos
I liked the arctic civilisation and I am still sad that they deid as the first civilsation 😓
Artic will rise ! The spirit is more important then war !
This was a great video I loved the creativity Silver!!!
We need to see a 1v1 between Ize and Starkiller to determine the true king of the jungle 👑
I liked the arctic kingdom until soup betrayed the desert
That ize Guy was the fing worst. Imagine being like that in a minecraft game. Arctic was the best!
THIS IS AMAZING 😍😍😍
Finally a Video
So sad to the jungle team so greddy:(
Are you the same as speedsilver
SKYBLOCK SKYBLOCK SKYBLOCK
Did anyone else notice that it wasn't actually technoblade that joined at the start of the video? It was actually technoblode
My Favorite was jungel
Hope to see more videos like this! :)
One of the best video!!!
Loved this!
I have been waiting for for this it's finally here let's go
Artic because sus
Atfirst I liked the jungle, then started rooting for arctic after getting some of suep's perspective, if that guy had been king they might have stood a better chance
Awesome video, but just so you know the past tense of begin is began, not begun. Begun can be used in certain circumstances but you said it wrong a few times in the video. Still loved watching it though :) keep up the good work man
Thanks for the opportunity to play in this event, it was really fun! The video turned out great and the editing is actually insane so GG :)  Also Star true jungle king >>>
so we have all learned that an undead teammate is the best teammate
Squid kid that nooooooooob
Sub to silver
Loved guy that said oh genshin impact hell yeah
About:I do minecraft stuff.
This is so cool😎😎
the arctic was the civilazation i was rooting for. but when they joined with desert, i knew they would die and i wanted desert to win. I would've cheered for jungle, until ize was crowned king. Star was much more worthy of leadership. Maybe he didnt have the gear but he was way more smart and calm and strategic, ize was just to cocky and yeah. Amazing video and the editing was perfected, i can tell this took a while to make. Love the videos silver, i hope everyone subscribes
It's a really cool video, but why did you stop playing hypixel skyblock?
I love your content! I’ve been watching you for months. And you don’t post content too often, making us not to get bored. Keep up the great work!
1:23 noob
I hate the King of jungle
I liked the most jungle civilization
I love pension impact but mild account that I got nearly to the end on got deleted somehow
squid just got violated with that farmer role
İ think this is your one of the best video
Let’s go desert
LONG LIVE THE ARCTIC :D
I'd liked the jungle armee!!!!
Glad ur back man I've been waiting for video
I liked the ice Kingdom the most(not only because of the Among Us statue btw). It's so sad that they lost everything immediately. I was actually so sad. As soon as I saw the blood lust in the jungle kingdom, I instantly disliked them. Respect went down and I would've preferred the other guy winning. I hate aggression. But at least the jungle kingdom lost at the end. Were some the remaining arctics who joined the deserts still alive or did they all die in the end? That'd be really sad.
My vote is jungle for them to win and if I was playing I would be a warrior
The event was fun despite being killed early on. Thanks for hosting Silver! I would defiantly try to participate again!
Nice
Jungle
Please
Number 2222222222222222222
These are always so amusing
What happened to hypixel skyblock
Make an another civilization video like this one love your stuff!!!!
Such an event, glad I could participate!
My favourite part Silver:led by the best potato farmer "Wait second world best"
Bro this is actually one of the very best Minecraft video ever made! Great job!
Ngl, I liked the arctic kingdom best:)
This was so fun to compete in! Nice video silver.
Nice content and what server is that btw sad 3 innocent:(
those animatics in the intro segment were insane, big props to whoever did that - and may I ask, how were they done? Super inspiring work. hope it blows up man
Looks like lag was horrendous in this Minecraft server
Noice
(19:16) Monkee.
THIS WAS ANAZING SEQUEL PLZPLZPLZ
this is the level of content and dedication I wish every content creator had. this is the best thing I could've seen immediately after breaking up with my gf.  thank you for hyperboosting my morale, thank you for the skyblock content and thank you for this AMAZING video.  keep doing a good job, man🖤
rip cow, gone but not forgotten
Im so sad that the jungle didn't won 😢
That video was incredible, I am in your discord and I tryed to join, unfortunately I couldn't. I used Genshin code too😎😎
Good vid! Next time make it a little more player focused rather than on events and the map.
Hehehh
you should do this again but i should be in it
squid kid is tired of being abused by youtubers for content.
Big K army rise..
With these experiments what I hate is the three different biomes fight instead of working together trading resources
(You made a farm congrats is that gonna help you win a fight?) made me laugh
Yo y'all better subscribe to my mans
Techno blade laughing rn😂 poor squid kid
We need another one of these videos with different biomes and mechanics really enjoyed this W
i known this man long enough to know this is his second channel
I've been waiting for this since 1999.
If squid_kid is in this that means technoblade should be in this
Yessss the potato kid is back ! 🐙🥔
This looks very fun
Tbh would have killed the ize guy if I were a jungle person
Now that was epic
is the jungle king dude annoying as hell to anyone else?
Thanks so much for the opportunity to be there!! The tests and the final game were so fun! Jungle for the win💚
Im suprised
my man must feel like the David Attenbrough of Minecraft
Do you have discord server
I hope to someday do or atleast participate in something like this
You have the best ideas for videos
THE POTATO WAR!!!
