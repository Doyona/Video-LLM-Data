I really see why ladies fall for him, he is such a player.
I really love players, he sure do 😆 🤣 😂

Nise vibiey❤

Ok something happened so here's the rest of my words too them we all have a purpose in life and that is to lift up the name of Jesus no matter who we are no position, name or title or money, stuff come close to JESUS so I pray they're stronger together for the cause of Christ 🙏🌹🙏
Aww, okay, thanks
I love me some Common. Will read his book ❤❤❤ hold on tight Jennifer!!
Usher is a blatant assassin!!😂😂😂
Common is smooth like butter❤❤❤❤I love them both❣
Mr. Common ...
I like the comfortable and play games.
Proud of you both if ever in St. Louis mo.come find me at New Cote Brilliant ⛪ Church of God 6195. Washington ave.sister Hudson nothing wrong with following your heart send invite to wedding. Brother Common shoe size is ring size.
Common, you BETTER not break her heart
His book might be on the best seller list from all the ex girlfriends who wanted to read the  advice he gives about loving…he definitely should be expert by now…🫤😂
Jennifer looks really pretty, and seems way too nice for him-but I will wish her the best because they are both good and grown. I’ll put it in the category of “it is better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all…” (Tennyson)   I did like Marlin W. for her, but…I guess he just wasn’t the one. 😂
I mean, just like him with Tiffany, I don't see these two matching well. And why since Tiffany is everyone trying to make him out to be the bad guy? Come on.. y'all knew he and Tiffany were not a good match, just like him and Jennifer. I think she's a good girl but something just ain't clicking. Like she could be his sister or spiritual mentor or something... iowwwn know but I'm not believing this connection.
I stayed down the street from Jennifer Hudson in chicago💯✌️ 69th Yale
I love them , real bad 😭
Omg❤.  I am glad they are friends.  I hope he isn't a player but if he is she knows it.  Getting old so it's time to settle down with a true love.
JEN: "Should I save it to open it" COM: "Yeah" Then HE precedes to open it himself.🤣🤣🤣 He could not wait for her to see. Lol
Two Oscar 🏆
Yall know how i met her, we broke up and got back together...oops that was the other one 😂
U love the bulls and you love a lot of women run jh😮😮😮😮
It's funny how she interviewed him like he wasn't her man lol
At this point ANYONE boasting Common as a boyfriend is quite funny. I have figured it out, Common is the Illuminati boy toy gift to the ladies who have crossed over. Common got more bodies than a funeral home. There is nothing to be proud of, and nothing sexy or attractive about that!!!
Make her happy in life lol ❤
Awww!!! 😍 Beautiful couple!!! Colabs between these two would be crazy!!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🫶🏼
The truth always hurts.😊
I love Commion and I like Jennifer and this just screams publicity stunt....
Blessings to this union two easy going people, he finally looks all in. Praying that they fill each other’s needs ❤. I’m looking for an early private wedding.
Common is a very intellectual man. JHud is smart and powerful but she better keep up her mental game to keep this man.
More out of touch with reality elitists.
O please  God bless  this couple
I like them together ❤️
Why does that man reminds me of an opportunist?
I'm so over Common!!! Not for real though 😂😂😂. I will forever be a fan.
He seem like he feeling her! You said you like them so I got them, You like mushy so it’s mushy. I had fun , I just wanted you to have fun, did you have fun?  If he frontin he trifling cause he saying the right things…♥️🤞🏾♥️🙏🏾. Im praying for yall !
Here in Africa we're concerned when a man turns 51 without a long-term commited relationship. Short-term dating until age 51 makes people suspecious. Ancestors are asking questions
Biggest mistake.  2 of them here.  First off, monetizing your relationship by putting the business out there in public that you have one.  2nd, getting involved with Common seriously in the first place.  I mean the guy just isn't committable.  Why did she leave her kid.s father?  Just to do this 👀
This relationship is another conversation piece. It will last as long as it is supppse to. Im sorry its Common he comes with an expiration date. All I hope is that Jennifer enjoys this moment. Have a blast.🤩🤩🤩
Insert BOMBASTIC eye roll!   He is a serial Dater!  History repeats itself quite often with this one.  If she’s at the TOP of her game…    HE is the COMMON denominator.  Let’s go through the list :  Tiffany (height of her career), Serena (🏆🎾), ERYKAH (Top 10 hits), oh the list is long.  Fast forward..  JENNIFER (EGOT, Talk show).    This dude has a Marketing Degree.  😳   Tread lightly, Sis.  🤦🏾‍♀️
Love you gal but he’s for the streets! Whew chile ❤😮
I'm happy for them!😊
I love the both and can only wish them all the best ❤
Chicago Royalty
They are a couple.
Tiffany somewhere rolling her eyes 😂
They been dating low key for a while.
She hella blushing
Theyngrown theh friends i se3 chemistry let them take their time they pribably been there done that. Time eill tell
These two are entertainers & it's pretty hard to have relationships in the industry. Shiid, it's hard without the industry, so imagine trying to have a relationship as an entertainer. I wish them luck, and hopefully, they'll be the exception 🙏🏿.
Why is everyone so pressed about COMMON and JHUD? They seem very well suited to me. Yes. He has been through quite a few (Public) relationships. But she doesn’t seem like the “marrying kind,” either. She has been “engaged” Twice. Each lasting for more than 7 years. That is A Lot. His child is grown. Hers is almost so. Neither got around to marrying. They both know that “going public” with their personal business is usually the “death knell” for a celebrity couple anyway. (Maybe he is just trying to sell his Book.) What’s the big deal? Could be they are just having fun?🤔
I love them as a couple
He said Mushy🤣
I seen you play basketball but stick with rapping 🤣
Shout out to Michael Jordan 💯❤️
Y’all need to leave Common be, that man is grown, finally got his life together & is ready to settle down… so is JHUD, yall so negative keep bringing up the past can’t let nobody evolve smh
Common don't commit. J protect your heart❤
I met him before and he treated me so ugly. I had no idea he is honestly misogynistic. Meeting him was such a shattering experience. I had assummed he was a honest and kind gentleman but it is all a façade. Such a shame.
I'm here for it 🙂.
I don't watch the show but I Love this!! The Chemistry is in the Building.... "We end up in a lot of the same places"  🤎💙❤ They are so lovely together..
Common is definitely a player..
Seeing their chemistry I think they're good for one another and I'm predicting the long haul for them. God bless their union.
Submissive without saying it....💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I fell in love with the Energy...the Vibe... Definitely Respected 🌹🌹🌹 Their wedding song will be "COME CLOSE" 💯💯🎯🐐✔️💕💕💕💕
🖤🖤🖤🖤
They are too cute!! I’ve never seen him interact with anyone like this before 🖤🖤
Another beard for the closeted one.
Kevlar vests in Chicago
❤❤❤😊😊😊
So happy for Common. He has a good one. Nothing but joy, peace and prosperity for them and their relationship..
I absolutely love the way they interacted with each other. I think they forgot we were watching… lol.
Common is the George Clooney of Rap😂
Why is he still relevant 😑
Poor Jhud. Why is he there? He just wants to be with a woman that makes more than him. This old, never married or engaged, # red flag. He has run thru some beautiful, intelligent, amazing and more talented women. U think she is his last one. Please don’t be dumb Jhud
They acting brand new 😂 sweet ❤
Coman is so handsome ❤❤
❤❤❤
They should do a song together and possibly an album.
God I hope this last and they work out for each other. They make such a wonderful couple.
I agree with you it seems he always aligns himself relationship wise with a certain type of Hollywood woman for publicity only 👀🧐🎙️
Oh, he's definitely Jennifer's "guy".  Cute!
I don't trust this guy
Big Fan !  BLUE SKIES and many other good songs from Common .
Love them together!!!!!!!!!!! 😍👏🏾🙌🏾❤️
AAAAAHHHHHH I AM HOLLERIIIIINNNNN!!!! They are SOOOO SUPER CUTE together, I LOVE THEM & I WISH THEM WELL!!!!!!😃😍🤩🥰🤗👏🏾🙏🏾🖤
Love them together!!!
Why are all celebrities starting talk shows now
I really hope you're gonna be good to Jennifer. Because she's a lady a classy lady. She doesn't need someone to put her to hell. She's been true enough if you don't mean it leave her alone. Love From Belgium
Why is his stupid ass opening her gift damn he is wrong for that and she’s trying to play it off like she may break a nail but she did look at him like wtf 🤷🏽‍♀️she never and me neither.
The best way to save your relationship is to keep most of it off social media! We don't need to know everything nor see where and what you do all the time. Not everyone wants you two to be happy. I DO! Even plain Jane "me" do not post often on FB, IG, or X. I've been happily married almost 4 years now because of it. Best wishes my dear!!!😊
I really hope you're gonna be good to Jennifer. Because she's a lady a classy lady. She doesn't need someone to put her to hell. She's been true enough if you don't mean it leave her alone. Love From Belgium
All I'm gonna say is whenever you see his knees swing back and forth, the end is near
Common that broke dude in the hood with no car job that be w the girl cause she got all that 😂😂😂
Jhud - I love you guys ❤️! Just curious,  Is there a lil Common in the mix 🤔 or just  patterned optics?
Poor thing, 😂 he'll be gone soon. He doesn't never stay over a year
Don't know these people personally. But Common does not have a good track record. Hope JHud does not become just another addition to his body count.
She said she ENJOYED that night and Common bit his bottom lip like yeah I enjoyed you later on that night!!!!!😁😁😁😁😁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Common is fine..and he 51
Awww!!!!🥰 Jennifer you guys are so super cute together. I love how you guys watch what you say lol.
See how he points out things she love or like so cute A MAN WHO PAYS ATTENTION
I pray for the best for both of you.I believe you both have experienced some "end roads" in your lives in the past. Soooo... what looks like the end of a road...could very well be the beginning!🥳 I am wishing you both the best!
I hope he treat her right she been through a lot
Come on and open the box 📦 lol. 😂
Yes praying for them both “yes the vibes are saying both”❤ U both
Jhud I'm so happy for y'all I pray blessings on y'all relationship 🙏🏽🙏🏽 all away Freeport Bahamas 🇧🇸🇧🇸🇧🇸
I feel like I can’t trust him until he put a ring on it 😅
He better not hurt her.
What do all these women have in Common? Jennifer Hudson, Erykah Badu, Serena Williams, Angela Rye, Taraji Henderson, Tiffany Haddish?
Jennifer, you are a sad person to be with this fool. He also has a longer history of being a serial dater.
I think he always wanted her. She kept him in a friend zone.
They look good together I’m just praying for them to make it through ❤❤❤❤❤
Y love Jenifer ... Brasil te ama!!!
Love them both ❤
I would like to thank my Lord and Savior, Lord God Almighty. *Revelation 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.* *John 10:30  I and the Father are one.*The Lord is 13 feet tall by the way.*
Imma just say mmmmmmm🥰
Common gets around with women.
Erykah must have taught him something. 😂😂😂
Don’t trust him!!!!!!!!😮😮😮😮
FUBOTV IS A SCAM BUYER BEWARE, THEY EMPTIED MY CHECKING ACCOUNT AND REFUSE TO REFUND MY MONEY
FUBOTV IS A SCAM BUYER BEWARE, THEY EMPTIED MY CHECKING ACCOUNT AND REFUSE TO REFUND MY MONEY
Common a very smooth man.😚😂 Longs y’all happy an bring each other peace and happiness . Make It Last Forever 😘💕💙
Who cares
People up there screaming like a damn fool. Why don't women learn from their mistakes and their partners mistskes? Does Jennifer not check his realti9nship history? Does she not care? Why putting him all out thete on Social media when there is nothing new to report? Other than Commo  likes dating powerful beatiful black women. He's not committing to no one any time soon and Jennifer is no diffrent enjoy it whilst it last until he gets scared when things get real for him then he'll bail and come out with some ridiculous reason. Why don't these men go for heaking therapy? Address their trauma heal the wounds and change the cycle? How about Common anxiety these black men do that. I mean dosent he get tired of dating? I guess not when women are so easily accessible in Hollywood! They just recycle each other. I do hope Ya'll get health check each time you change Partners? Are black women even thinking about that??? It's so boring and tired to see the same old rhetoric 'oh they look so cute together oh they are so hot oh they are so sweet'  news flash those are not realistic foundations for a true authentic loving relationship .
I love the comfort and playfulness
Man.....black ppl are absolutely obsessed with race. Such a bizarre culture
😊love the interaction between them.....Commonnnnnnnnn please don't hurt Ms Hudson.....she is a special kind.....😊
I just love the optimism.......we all thought him and Badu were so good together too............
She is .I think he catches feeling and than drops them so he dont get caught up with just one. He aint no reel man playing with these women feeling like that .women be wear he playing with ur heart and feeling.
I do like them together. But take it real easy with this one Jennifer Common be serious if you want to play grab a 🏀 stop using women as an emotional dumping ground !
Just on my experience in the game, he seems rehearsed. I hope he isn't love bombing her as it seems cuz she too old to not recornize that, however Jennifer do seem more of his speed but Common is not a settling dwn type of guy
I hope he is the right choice for her❤AMEN!
It's awful funny how he's out with a book and being promoted by 'his truly'. I've always felt like he was an opp. (Time will tell, and I shole can't wait!) 🍿
Hope it lasts. Common be running through women.
Love your love ❤️
This is Beautiful ❤
Jennifer acting kind of childish
Common don't disappoint us you be a good person please don't make her cry
This is too cute “I remember you said you like these so I got these for you” “this material reminds me of you… it’s mushy… you love mushy”
I hope that he treats her right she  seems to be happy right now
I love that dress!!!
Comin never get in old
I hope he does not become a spanner is her works because she is doing so well let's hope he not trying be current instead of being common
He’s a USER who in for the next highly promoted star! When Tiffany was everywhere, he moved in!! Good luck JHUD!
They are dryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Introducing this relationship was absolute beautiful and sweet…. This was really cute y’all! I send blessings your way! I’m praying for y’all to be together forever!!!
Why am I blushing whenever he says anything sweet to her?  He better do right by cause I would boycott him
Prayers 🙏 and much love ❤ jhud XOXO XOXO XOXO
He has a type real strong talented women
Looking forward to seeing Usher when he plays at the Superbowl!
No Jennifer...take a note from him and the last comedian Lady Hadish...
Nice Jennifer 😊you and Common seems very happy together 🥰❤Hallelujah Praise God 👏🏽 🙌🏽 🙏🏽 for Everything. Amen 🙏🏽 ❤
What a sweet man!
I love y'all together 😊too cute
Praying only the best for them!!! ❤❤
Does he have a project coming out? Please tell me he didn't get the interview based off being her dude. They could've had this conversation when they got home tonight.
so so so happy for jennifer
Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me - John 14:6. Jesus is on His way back, let's use this time to get to know Him 🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
Enjoy the ride Common and Jennifer.
May GOD give Jennifer HIS BEST & may Sister receive it… I love you Jennifer🙏🏽❤️💕✝️🥹🛐
❤❤❤yall  know they're  a couple 😊 come on now
Awww! I knew something was up between them. They have been flirting and cheesing like little kids. I am so happy for Jennifer. She's a wonderful ❤️ sweetheart and has been a great friend to everyone.
He did the same thing with Tiffany Hardish when she was hosting the Ellen show. Sad😢
Erica taught him about colors, how beautiful 💛
Dang! Flirting selves! 😂❤🎉
I hope this is not about Common promoting his new book.
he is a scammer riding j hudson wave smh
I don’t get the fascination with and attraction to common 🤷🏿‍♂
This is game baby, they vibes real good together
JHud has been blushing since he walked out!!!
I love their chemistry! May it last forever! Team JHud and Cmon!!!❤
Awkwaaaaaarrrrrrdddddd!
Great friends 1st but he never said anything special or unique about her. Anyone can sing compliments or  accomplishments but until a man says i care, i love, she's special, she's the one..  just have fun being romanced
With Common when the relationship goes public within a few weeks it’s over. I  love Jennifer and pray for her happiness 💥💥💥

Here for a good time and not a long time 😂😂😂
I hope Common sees all rhese admonishments!  Common, Imma assume yuu are oerusing.  You  BEST treat her like yiu would treat your Ma and daughter OR ELSE!!! LOVE you two tigerher.  Cintats on dating a true Afrikan QUEEN!   NI CHEATING, DUDE!
Common will walk very soon. He gets bored very easily - jerk.
I am so happy for them! ❤I hope their relationship blossoms into friends, love , and marriage if that’s what they choose and if not  a long life of happiness. People can change and if you really love someone they will change they will adjust anything is possible when you get bitten from the love bug. 🐞 Can’t judge them on their past relationships because there is always that one that makes your life change forever good luck
Didn't she do the guy she was first dating wrong?? I am just asking...
🤨🤨👀👀👀🫖☕
I love this!!❤❤❤❤
I love it yesss Lonnie & Jenny!!!! ❤❤❤❤
They're cute with it. So coy. For those who didn't know, he gave it away once he said that she's an EGOT and won the Oscar in her first role.
I think the respect, love and happiness she has for herself, makes him want to respect and love and give off happiness with  her the same. They seem to level each other out...A good wholesome real Betty Wright woman...the only other time I seen him like this was with Queen Latifah in Just Wright! !!! Again, this is more his match to me! Love them together!!!❤🙏🏽
I think them being from the same place keeps him on his toes 😊. They are too cute ❤
I think he may marry her he's getting old most of them Seattle down when they are older
They genuinely have a great chemistry & connection ❤ Blessings to them both
Yall are so adorable together. Sending you nothing but positive, loving, happy vibes this way! Yessssssss! I’m so geeked for yall 👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I think he is going to Marry her. She is different
He's all weak kneed
Awwww
Is there a shortage of men in Hollywood?  Did Jhud do her homework?  I wish people would keep their relationships to themselves.   No further comments
I love you both , that was fun.
Common may be a good dude however, Common is not good with relationships. I Will be very surprised if this one last a long time. Just my opinion🤷🏽‍♀️
Love Love them together!!! Chicago love.   Nothing like two Chicago people.
Lol......am i the only one hearing indirect flirting without flirting directly
She makes him nervous...I hope he gives her/them a chance 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 She helped him picked out the outfit
This was Soo sweet ❤🌹
With common it seems hes always the the common denominator of a relationship death.... I think Jennifer is taking a risk on this one
This two feels  organic  meant  to be❤
Ummmmm Where Is His Children??? Cause If I'm Not Mistaken Miss J. does have ONE Child So Is He Willing Or Ready To Become That Special "Stepparent" HUH We All Shall👀😂 Like That Song SAYS "Don't Go Breaking Her❤"
Friends first…👍🏼🙏🏼💯
Great Show ❤❤❤❤
People so messy miserable and judgmental. One thing for sure you never heard anything messy about him. Not all relationships last and to say this one won't. Meanwhile some of you laying down with cheaters every night yet so worried about her relationship 🙄
The way they are trying to stay professional with each other is cute.
Lol.....they are so cute....knowing they dateing.....❤
I love it!! 😍 I was cheezing the whole time.😂 At first, I was not sure if they were a good match, but then i thought about it and said, of course, they are. I have been rooting for Common to find someone who gets him and fits his unique personality.  And i really feel Jennifer does. And I really believe its nc they are both from Chicago.  Chicago dudes have a different vibe.  And if you date them, you'll have to get them. My brothers from the CHI are the smoothest dudes you'll ever meet. 😂 I wish only the best for you both. ❤❤❤ #chitownlove
🥰😍🤩
Lovely! Common please make it with Jennifer. You two look great together.
Lol at them acting like they aren't a couple on this interview😂 GOOD LUCK YALL!😊
Tbh I like her way better than Tiffany, Jennifer seems more mellow like they vibe better
Life
Common go with everbody. 😂😂 As long as he ain’t hurting them or bringing them down. Play on playa
So he is promoting a book and staying relevant. Why do our beautiful women keep falling for the okidote? Strokes of paint all over the wall, 10,000 red flags, not enough. "Fire and desire, use them and abuse them" We shouldn't have to tell her to run. She knows!! Lets just mind our business.....
I never knew how attractive he is
I am thankful that Grown Folks are do not allow each other's pasts to limit them to move forward, privately and/or publicly.💐👏🏾 #LetEmLive💯
Common needs to go back to the dealership and have his odometer turned back.
BYE COMMON!!!!with your FAKE SELF...MOVE ON JENNIFER.
Common is a set of bald tires
I'm praying that he does right by her. I am loving this glow on her. 💞🥰💞
Not common looking her up and down 🙄
The best show ever! Bravo Jennifer🎉
Love em and leave em Common...Common ladies man extradinaire
Lord they’re corny.. geesh y’all.. her talk show skills are no bueno
Uncomfortable interview for her. This dude is trouble. But whatever!
Beautiful couple
Tiffany Haddish punching the air somewhere. Lol common can't keep a woman. She'll be another notch on his bed. He seem suuuuuper fake
Why are they acting like they just met🤷🤦
I like common and jennifer hudson may they continue to be happy wheather together or apart. May god give them both love and happiness and peace
This is a nice vibe that I'm seeing here between these 2, nosy so I wanna see more but know it's not our business 😭 but they are cute 😂❤
Jennifer my girl! That is the man for you girl! Yesssss he is sharp! The Yellow Outfit with his Complexion is Pounding! Girl do I hear weddings bells! God Bless You two! ❤🥰
Cute interview
I love this !❤❤
I hope he does not do her bad 🙏🏾
Praying for you young Lady for God's will to be done in your life!
I pray Common doesn't use or hurt Jennifer he doesn't have a good track record with women. He is a womanizer and have hurt plenty of good women.i wouldn't trust him plz be careful  Jennifer  and hold on to your MONEY.
He better propose soon and marry her. The End….
At least common isn’t the jealous type he let her Jen and usher tho have fun
Common is sooooo.....common 🥱
Common is a PLAYER!!!!   He gets with all these female celebrities to test the waters and moves on to the next! SMH  Let’s see how long this lasts! 👀
Common and Jennifer Hudson they are the most beautiful couple ever I hope and I pray that they stay together forever in they’re relationship as a couple ever I wish them both the absolute best common and Jennifer Hudson ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽
That's right
Common tapped datass
He commits to teams like he does women
They are so SWEET together... I feel like I'm in  love!! 😁😂🥰🥰
I'm rooting for these two SO hard!! I think they're cute together... 🥰💜💜
This is kinda cringe. Jennifer Hudson looks beautiful though! I can’t with Common tho.
Nahhhh Common likes JHud
I am wishing many blessings for the both of you and nothing but love 🙏🏽♥️🙏🏽♥️
Comon is the man you date before you meet your husband
This show was awsome!  I loved listening to Jennifer and Common speak with so much Respect and Appreciation for each other's accomplishments.  I enjoyed her conversation with Girl's With Beats.  It was so inspiring.  I wish all involved today many more successes in their personal and professional journey.  Today was MUST SEE TV.   GOD BLESS YOU ALL!  ❤
🙏Bless thm 😊
He’s full of crap.
I think he’s willing to get with her and she with him to explore and really put in the work for something genuine. I can feel it- Jennifer is down to earth and he wants to train her- working out together being playful, looking out for her(a man being a real man and a woman who wants to be taken care of( not material things) but simply doing what makes the other feel joyful. They can buy things but neither can touch their souls like someone sincere and truly wants to protect and love you.     Some of his past relationships wasn’t meant to last and I know he’s glad too. I don’t think a real man or woman care for loud Obnoxious people, I didn’t for him😃but I like these two together 👏😊
Black love ❤️ we need more of this
what happened to JH and Marlon Wayne ?
Run jud run ... He has a sick twisted fitish for strong successful women and then gets bored of em

It’s obvious he likes her but I hope he is not one of those guy that dips once the honeymoon stage is over .
Another one bite the dust. From Common
She calls her show a Happy Place. Wishing that for the both of them. Let’s goo y’all 💞
He seems nervous in a cute way around her❤
I don’t think Common is capable of a permanent relationship. It could be something that happened in his childhood.
YesssssI like those sneakers
❤
These two are, Just Right and If This Isn't Love, then I can at least see The Light - Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, da-da!
I don't know everythang but I know what love looks like ❤ 😊
“Open it rough” 😅I caught that JHud!
Jennifer. Please run very, very, very quickly from this old toxic common fool.
I don't know anything about celebrities' love life, really. But, what I do know is that many people from the opposite sex can be good friends without being lovers. However, if they do decide to date or fall in love, that's great and cool also. I pray that all lovers love will blossom and that they will know how to treat each other with great geniune, LOVE, trust, respect, honesty, kindness, gentleness, genorsity, support, thoughtfulness, compassion, and forgiveness. See, naw, that's what's REAL TRUE old school ENDLESS love relationships is made out of for all human beings❤
Jhudd please guard your heart please!!! Common breaks too many great women hearts!! Please Jen be careful!!!
Lmao 😆 they won't last sorry to say....! They don't even look good together smh.... Common has commitment issues lol 😆...... C'mon Jennifer you know he's not the one for you lol 😆..... Namaste shalom shalom 🙏 ✌️
I was happy for them then i saw the comments😭 ( sorry but everybody cant be wrong)
Y'al are cute together ❤️
They So Cute!!!!
I like the two of them together.  All of us have dated many until we found the right one.  Just because he's well know, doesn't mean it should be any different.
I love how they express thier love languages to each other 🥰🤗🥰🤗 omg its so sweet
Ilove Jennifer  .H, awesome  Beautiful Women God bless you ❤ what's up Commons  love you GodBless you to.
Aww they look so wonderful together now I don’t know they might be getting together soon and Or getting married ❤❤… I’m Just saying hoping he don’t play with her heart like those other ladies But they have sooo much in common than the other lady… see he’s buying her All this stuff that’s a true Man… He Ain’t fronted and he’s listening to what she like….
Common nor Jennifer are the people they were 20 years ago. Cheers 🥂 to this chapter of their lives!. ❤️
Whatever...Common is getting ran through 😮
It's always beautiful in the beginning, I hope and pray that  it stays that way! Keep being amazing J.🙏🏿♥️✌🏿💪🏿🌹
Hope she is taking it like a fun ride cause boy got a reputation.
He’s fine.. smooth talking… Jennifer, girl…I hope it works out but he has a trash track record
I’m so happy for them.  Jennifer remember God is 1st, not man.  Keep your focus on God and everything will fall into place.  Take your time getting to know each other.  ❤
🙋🏾‍♀️ hear what she say man from Chicago man from Chicago. I’m from Chicago they both are from Chicago. They will work out they won’t get married.💯💯💯💯💯💯🏆😂😂😂
It's so cute to interview your boyfriend!  They were super flirtatious I really hope that this lasts because as we all know and I see in the comments, does have a reputation amongst the ladies in the industry
🙋🏾‍♀️ Job catch it did y’all catch it mid west? We called them (gym shoes.👟) New York where I live they call him sneakers soda. We call it pop in “Chicago”” notice they know what each others talking about. They know the language, Midwest gym shoes. I’ve got some gym shoes for you. Both of them are from Chicago.🏆🏆🏆🏆
Jen is flirting up a storm!! I wish her luck!!🙂❤️
🙋🏾‍♀️ listen to his accent listen to her accent, Midwest, we sound the same.  We have a different accent from a lot of people who’s not from the Midwest or from the Midwest, but the suburbs, but the city of Chicago our accents are different. Our broken language is the same and we know it  our accent is funny because black people from the south different parts of the south migrated to the Midwest and they brought that southern accent I know his baby mother, personally common. I am 60 years of age I met his baby mother in the 90s when he was a cop in common rapper called common sense He wasn’t with the young lady back then they didn’t call it my baby mama a friend of mine knew her personally, and we went to her apartment in her apartment. She had pictures of common sense when he was calling himself common sense and pictures of the little girl, their daughter. I’m saying all this to show Chicago is a big city but it’s really small because everybody on the southside west side which is mix of every culture northside mix of every culture “East “ side 99% black it’s still the southside you just going east of the south side the Loop Downtown Loop, Randolph State Street mixture that’s why the money is so what I’m saying is the mid west Chicago vet city especially on the southside and the west side everybody know each other we have more in common being with a Chicago man or Chicago woman so they may work because they know each other they come from the same “place”. not only that he has admitted he has been in therapy. I don’t know if he still in therapy, but he was in therapy for his childhood traumas of father divorcing his mother and walking out father not being there and not trusting relationships, so this may work for him this time.
Love it! Enjoyed their playful banter! J & C BEAUTIFUL couple! ❤
My Virgo sister is glowing 🥰 Love you Jennifer ❤️
🙋🏾‍♀️ reading these comments no disrespect. Y’all are so disconnected but I will connect y’all back to why they have a better chance in working as a couple than their exes and basically this goes for all of us here it is🤷🏽‍♀️. They both are from Chicago y’all listening but yeah we figured it out. They telling y’all what they have in common common is from Chicago Hyde Park southside Jennifer Hudson is from Chicago 79th St. southside. They both attended rival high schools in Chicago. They have everything in coming because they’re from Chicago. This is why they are throwing out the balls. I work for the bulls, restaurants and stores because they both have been to those restaurant stores shopping malls downtown loop northside. Hi pod high school South shore, Academy high school. They have 99% in common than being with a strange person who don’t know your background.. I am originally from Chicago southside Chicago southside has always been 99% black. Everybody know everybody shop at the same areas know the same people aware of different schools, the black library, Martin Luther King library, Malcolm X college, Martin Luther King high school, Malcolm X., college, Malcolm X., high school, Phillips high school they know all of the schools . Garrett famous cheese, popcorn Chicago southside all black, famous Italian fiesta popcorn. jew town back in the day Jewish areas. You go get the Jewish Polish deep dish pizza they know all of what I’m saying Chicago people. mid west term analogy mid west dress called the way we dress the dances we do only in the mid west some music we listen to mid west house music, so they have more in common than being with a strange people from different parts of the “world”. I personally know comments, baby mother, I’m not gonna say her name I met her in the 90s when he was up and coming hip-hop rapper.
Really ladies, he should have stayed with Angela Rye? thats literally a nutcase.  i get why he left the other women. we love beautiful black women , thats a given but what matters to a man ultimately is peace and non toxicity, men value peace over your booty and looks ultimately- thats what we look at initially but that other  boring stuff matters more - he was right to walk away from those other situations because those chicks were off, this girl here doesnt come across as a drama queen from what ive seen of her over the years, so we shall see what happens
Praying for both of you. Great couple!! You guys are fabulous together! ! Common Michelle Obama is willing to advise you regarding relationship. Michelle is not perfect however she is your number one supporter. I might be wrong,.
I don't sense any compatibility or connection.  It's PR and it's good for her show.  He doesn't love anyone but himself.  Jennifer ask him to explain himself about their relationship and he talks about what she's got and what she's earned over the years and that she loves God never mind if she's thoughtful, kind, attentive, supportive we already knows she smart that's how she got the show.  I'm sorry but he's temporary.  He's trying to stay relevant.
I really like Common and Jennifer Hudson. Common seems to have a down to earth personality, easy going character and with non of the wild stuff. Jennifer is very down to earth and very protective as she should be. I observed them both and Common was wanting to be a little bit hands on cause you could see he adores Jennifer but Jennifer kept it very professional. I thought for sure behind those flowers they would sneak a little kiss on the lips but it didn’t happen. Jennifer is being ever so cautious and I can’t blame her. I hope that this relationship will actually work. They’re cute together. They seem to be a good match. Sooo much better than Common’s last relationship and Jennifer’s too. I’m truly in their corner. Ya’ll don’t mess up please 🙏🏾 ❤
Common... dont you dare do Jennifer wrong, we mean it!!! She been through a lot and deserves to be happy. You too deserve it but we know your history, so remind yourself every single day: this girl is a #keeper. All the best to both of you but we're keepin an eye on you Common.
How is Common gonna tell her to wait to open it... and then open it himself? 🤣
Though I believe that this relationship won't last to the point of growing old together until death do them part, Jennifer is a grown woman and can make her own choices. Who knows if they're in it until the flames run out. I'm sure they talked about their expectations beforehand. Maybe they'll last a few more months or even years, but they're definitely splitting up down the road.
Introducing this relationship was absolute beautiful and sweet…. This was really cute y’all! I send blessings your way! I’m praying for y’all to be together forever!!!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Sunshine in Jennifer life, Common got the yellow vibe going on. Happy for you two!❤️
I'm (like millions of others) a HUGE J-Hud fan and loved when she kicked off her talk show. I'm not sure what's going on this season but her signature inspirational monologue at the start of the show and her mugs are missing of late and she's had some questionable guests on. Now -- her guest is the questionable Common whose checkered history with high profile black women raises great concern for Ms. Hudson. It's a bad idea to inject your personal life into the talk show. Who knows what the producers - and Executive Producer herself, Ms. Hudson is thinking? And Common sitting there talking with his right legging moving side to side!
Is it just me or were they shy flirting on camera. Common was like “ you just wait to we get home”. And Jennifer was like “and I am telling you ❤”. I’m here for it. ❤❤❤❤
JENNIFER, YOU IN DANGER MAN.😎. WE LIKE COMMON, BUT THIS WON’T LAST.  COMMON IS RUNNING THROUGH WOMEN LIKE WATER. 👿
They actually have a lot in common FR and they understand each other I admire the respect he shows her I’ll take it
Common is not a demon people.😂😂😂He is a man. Jennifer is not a baby. She is a very grown a woman.❤
🥰🥰
With his track record idk I hope he don’t hurt her
I think common needs mental help he has done this same play book with sooooo many women, I’m from the south when someone gives you shoes it’s for you to walk the hell out of their lives…
So sweet and great interview!❤
Why I got those shoes lol
Maybe Jennifer is different.  I cant comment on his past relationships and why they didn't last. A scorn woman will always make the man look bad especially if its nit working. If they're enjoying themselves why speak negative.  Im sure Jhud knows about his past. Just wish them happiness and leave out the negatively. Time will tell.😊
She's dry even interviewing her boo.....there's no hope for this show
JHud has been blushing since he walked out!!! ❤
The vibes of Jennifer and Common are saying "you're a couple, without saying you a couple!!!" They make good friends for sure. I see GOOD wholesome respectable chemistry between them. Common don't you dare break JHud's heart. She is a...#Keeper  Peace and Blessings to you both🙏🏽💕💪🏽
I can see them but nervous about common running though.
I love him and Jen being together.
I love Jenny ❤❤
love you Jennifer and, wish for you nothing but the best in life,,blessings to you both ❤❤❤🎉🎉🙏🙏
Common!!! 🎤 Commoooon!!!! Do not take up space in our girl's life if you don't mean her the very best!!! You both are just beautiful souls!!! Don't hurt her!!!!!!🙏💝💝
Looks like he gets with any woman that has a BIG platform to promote himself. 😏
Look how he looks at her! He's letting her know, he's her's! 💞
Praying for happiness for Jennifer peace
Who exactly is Common again? I've only known him from dating Tiffany and now Jen...
I believe she may have Commons attention ❤.
I'm happy for them but I've been happy for all his previous relationships.  Hopefully JHud is the one.
They said if you buy her shoes she will walk out ur life
Common looks like he's in love.❤
This seems staged and rehearsed  and she seems nervous. I wish I can see the authenticity in this. Please do not hurt her Common.
These two love each other so much. Powerful chemistry.
Love them together!!!❤
So Happy for you both! Beautiful couple. God Bless!❤🙌🏾🙏🏽🔥👍🏾🥰😘
After he dump or break up with that Intelligent Woman Angela I know he was a clown
After him decide to move on again hope black women done with him.
She worth more than this clown. The things women have to settle for
Girl, move slowly and take it slow. You know his track  record.
I m so happy to see you in couple with Jennifer and man common is my favourite singer too I wish you both you big love why not make son together 🤗
She's so gitty, she's def in love
Either way they'll both be fine regardless of the outcome.  Why did this feel like for a ratings show? Jmo
I really hope you're gonna be good to Jennifer. Because she's a lady a classy lady. She doesn't need someone to put her to hell. She's been true enough if you don't mean it leave her alone. Love From Belgium ❤
I'm wondering if he's coming out with a song or movie. I hope the best for Jennifer
I love it, he so handsome congratulations, Jennifer if you like it,vi 💕 it. Don't worry about the noise just do you. Haters will hate
I love Jennifer too much to say anything negative. Praying the best 🫶🙏.
I'm feelin' the LOVE ❤❤❤❤
Hey now, COMMON trying hard to impress; perfect example of star being nervous when they see a SUPER-star!
This guy is a joke, he is a serial dater and nothing more. It sounds good.
Common only dates high value women
Oh Common got game and you bout to find out Girl 😂
Sorry, I just can’t see them as a couple.
As a Black person I am so sick of the  community and media narrative that all we ever can hope to want and become is either an athlete or some type of entertainer.Sorry growing up I wanted to be forensic scientist and that is what I am.Come on people want more for your kids then to be entertainers because plenty of us who are successful never ever wanted to be.
They seem so comfortable together. Pray that things go well for them . I heard them mention God, so if He is the center they will WIN
I can’t stop smiling!😍
Common comes across as boring
He is going to hit it and quit it dude is afraid of commitment
I've never seen Common this opened about a relationship I think he just may like Jhud😊
I love the comfort and playfulness. They got this.
👀
Love this for them!!
I want to root for this but I’ve rooted for the past relationships that he’s had that have been public. He keeps meeting “the best person he’s ever met in his life”. Same script, different cast 🥴
The internet is full of crying disappointed women wanting a man making 100k year and  travel is a must loves God. Do you think Common qualifies? Count your own relationships
Always quite happy for Common and J Hud can prove it! 😂❤
Why did he open her gift? 😅 Jennifer is so thoughtful and loving...why does she fall for guys who are unavailable?? I wish her all the love in the world. She is a darling and deserves the best.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽for Jhud, guard your ❤hun
I just don't want her to get hurt cuz Jhud has been through a lot I just don't want to get hurt 😮
I hope he doesn't hurt  her 🙏🏽💜
Love y'all both, but.... OK Common's always been too cool for school, and Jennifer is Ms. Independant, hanging with 'safe,' 'forever friend' , mostly gay, men... So... To each "her" own... ❤
Owk Common is fiiine😊😊
This man has never come clean!! Serena Williams, Tiffany Haddid.... now her! From one to another!!  For Tiffany, he was on tv, SM saying this and that... then the break up... the explanation? He doesn't have to explain. But seeing a celebrity fooling around.. just wondering. Maybe he hasn't found himself yet😂
These days, as long as she has a job and doesn't have to depend on the man they in, when they money ends so does the relationships we saw this with Jennie and Jezzy, and many other, I say this but hope it works.
Don't be no fool Jennifer stay mindful Common is a ladies man and womanizer he knows what he is doing  Love, Sex, and Emotions can blindsided you always stay in touch of your feelings yes many will say you are a beautiful couple, cute, he's the one, marriage could be in the air, all theses words maybe true however, Common is not that guy. My dear give him another six months to a year and you will see the real Common take care of your heart.
❤
They make a cute couple! Seems like they both are on the same page..reminder..NOT EVERY WOMAN WANTS TO BE MARRIED! As long as THEY are Happy..that is all that matters. And if you your man hurt you..or left you. That IS NOT COMMON'S fault.
This relationship might work out. They have a lot In ‘common’, especially Chi-town!  Jennifer may be the one to tame him, lick him down and make him surrender. 😂
Common, you bet not hurt Jennifer.
Is it me or did I just witness true chemistry
This relationship. Will not last
JHud is such a Virgo 😆… if we weren’t all aware that she was dating Common, we wouldn’t be able to guess from her friendly but professional conduct - we would just think Common is laying it on thick 😁😂🤣😅. Cute interview. ✌🏾❤️🇬🇧
Run Jenny, 🏃‍♀️ 🏃‍♀️ RUN.😂😢
Girl. What r u even doing? U must have a thing for self infliction.
I luhhhhhh all disssssss uhhhhhh ❤
WHAT A SCRUB!! WATCH THE ENTIRE INTERVIEW! HE WAS FIXATED ON HER STATUS AND TALKING ABOUT A BAR THAT WAS SET THAT HE  HASN'T REACHED HIMSELF.. JEN RUN!
You two make a great couple and represent the Chi to the fullest.
