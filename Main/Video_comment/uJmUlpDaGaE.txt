Shapo is very lucky that he didn't get banned from tennis for life for blasting that chair ump in the face in Davis Cup. He needs to stop complaining at all, and be glad that he still gets to play.
Shapo totally out of line here, no respect
For those who follow tennis, Carlos is such a legend.
Carlos: "There's a shot clock, he has 8 seconds left"  Shapo: "But I can't read"
This was when Denis still believed he could make Grand Slam finals. But with a mindset like his, that's never going to happen.
Umpire should not getting emotional even if players are wrong I'm sorry. His job is to be calm and officiate the game correctly, issues like this will always arise and getting chipping back at players like this is simple unacceptable in my opinion. Commentator summed it up perfectly here 0:32
Clickbait...
Nadal is such a disgrace. Always violating this rule. No wonder ATP is corrupt
It's good to see umpire standig up for themself sonetimes
the ego on carlos is insane. anyone defending him is insane.
The referee was Morpheus.  Shapo: "I know tennis" Morpheus: "Show me."
Some tennis umpires are complete twats. What is the purpose of this umpire? He is allowing Nadal time code violations all day. Then he warns Shapovalov for what? Total turd
Everyone on edge since the Great Leftwing Reset of Global Totalatarian Govt control
This is what actually happened: Shapo was looking at the umpire to make sure that he had his eye on the clock. Instead the umpire looked at him. Considering that the umpire did the opposite of that previously when Nadal wasn't ready for Shapo's serve he asked the umpire why he was looking at him. The umpire got annoyed and Nadal acted the hero by pretending to have no clue about what was going on.
Nadal always takes extra time between points. Everyone knows this. The refs absolutely should call him on it. Then after the 4th set this ref let Nadal take a 7 minutes break. Which is ridiculous and completely against the rules. Shapo had every right to be upset. Everyone should be forced to play by the same rules. No matter how many GS titles you’ve won.
Shapovalov trembled all over when he got close to Nadal😂😂😂😂
💀💀
Shapovalov is totally right though...
Nadal did the same to Tiafoe once again...10 minute bathroom break.
It feels like the umpire was taking sides here. I mean it's true that Shapovalov shouldn't have been calling him corrupted or anything, but he's an umpire he's supposed to be professional. He can give him a code violation and see that he gets fined for that as he indeed was, but he can't hold a grudge against a player, it's not really fair.
The Canadian has to concentrate on his game rather than playing mind game with legend ..
If only Shapo could focus those energy in complaining and being a whiny little bitch to his play then he might win something. Might.
Look people, men and women. I am the MOST honest man in our universe, in what we all can "imagine", in what the astronomers can "think of". Mr. Rafael Nadal, probably and I think he is, is a CRIMINAL human being, a EXTREMELY DANGEROUS PERSON. This is a very serious accusation, I know. This fact is that, 100%. Rafael Nadal, Mr. Nadal has stolen very many tournaments by harassing and annoying many professional tennis players. Even more, his "used to be coach", Mr. Toni Nadal, and actually his present coaches, like Mr. Carlos Moyá and even his love affair with Mr. Marc Lopez, have committed serious actions against the very basic values of the Tennis Association basic conduct. People, we are talking about  allegedly CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES and the fact that the ATP has done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT. Can you guys think of a criminal activity legally accepted? This is really a weird person, Mr. Nadal, or maybe a, CRIMINAL PERSON?
Denis Shapovalov is a scam artist, not worthy of even a single match, first he should sort out his inner conflicts
this ump sucks
Shapo should remember that this kind of behaviour will distract him (not Rafa, as he wanted). Grow up Dennis ... and congrats for not throwing a ball to the umpire this time.
enuf shapo, u losing fans
Shapo psyched himself out with all this, and it showed in the 5th. Had all the momentum in the world, but let it slip. I hen Medvedev followed suit in the final. Congrats to Rafa, but he caught a HUGE break with Djoker out of the tournament. Rafa has zero chance against Nole on hard courts.
Cry Baby Shapo Go Home Plant Camote. 🤣😁👎
I like Shapo he is like Djokovic , he speaks his mind !
To be honest I like Mohamed Lahyani and I hate Carlos
When Carlos took his sunnies off he was thinking, “boyyyyy if we weren’t on a tennis court right now I’d whoop your ass”.
Carlos should DO HIS JOB in the beginning... not allow another player to drag out the time, and then do NOTHING
Shapo was getting itchy as he knew he was losing the game.  He was looking for excuse and to rile up NAdal. Calling a the ref corrupt in the middle of the game twice long before would get any ref riled up.  He should have a few violations himself.
jack ass ump ,unbeleivable biased fool
Honestly think both players handled this well and Carlos was a little overly sensitive.
Great player. Bless Spain ❤️❤️
I'm done watching tennis once Federer and Nadal are gone
Ah yes, the moment Denis Shapalov’s tennis career died
ronaldo the referee is having a bad day... how rude!
The kid has to concentrate on his game rather than Legend 😊☺️
next gen in tennis : denis the menace " y are all corrupt" , medvedev "u are a small kids who dont know how to fight" ,tsispas " bulshit russian"  sad times for tennis soon
Every tennis player with a V in their surname you just know is gonna be a prick.
Younger generations always complaining lmao
It would have been so funny if Nadal just knocked him out flat with a mighty right hook at the net. But maybe that's just me.
really good camera work and transitions. good cinematic work
Ah yes, Shapo the crybaby.
There certainly seems to be a problem with Carlos' way of explaining.
Dude worst ref ever !!! Like wtf 🤬!      And I have been to Manacor and Spain 9 times !!!!      And I am Canadian
20 slams to his name and Nadal needs to cheat to beat a nobody, Whatever Dennis
Nadal let you win two sets. Crybaby
Seems umpire and referees are getting worse and worse in each sport. Wtf is going on
Shapo: 😭😭😭  Nadal: 🤨
Punch on lads let’s see who’s man
Denissss🥰
Ohh shut up Win a GS (just one) before you cry
All Australian umpires are controversial and mentally abnormal. I never seen this level of attitude with other umpires in USA or UK or France
how bad is this referee looool
Rafa is complete bush league with his antics. Obviously one of the greats, but he needs to be better than this. He’s getting worse and worse.
And Nadal tool extra 50 secs Lol😂
Cry me a river Shapo
Any star who complains about superstars being judged by The Jordan Rules is just asking to lose the argument and their temper.  Let it go, Denis, and find a way to win.
Rafita puertas eres un fraude
bullshit and unfair treatment everywhere  , Rafa was delaying his serve SOOOO many times , he shoulsd be suspended for that for a year .
ez for nadal bcs no djokovic pussys ozzies
OK, maybe Rafa is not the fastest when it comes to changing his T-shirt or tying his shoelaces 😄. But his face (0:30) speaks for itself - he had no idea what was going on... He doesn´t do that on purpose (to disturb his opponent).
Nas Veliki Srbin Novak Djoovic je najbolji na svetu, i ako ga vi mrzite,sve mu namerno smestate,zato sto je Najbolji na Sveti,i uvek ce da bude Najbolji i najaci💪💪💪👍👍👍
Nadal camp knows that they have had issues with Carlos in the past so now they've basically bought him off. Shapo was correct.  Carlos is corrupt.   Later in the match , he allowed Rafa to take extra time at a crucial moment in the match to disrupt Dennis's momentum.  Don't know how Rafa can be proud of his accomplishments when he has a history of these antics in all matches when he's down and about to lose. Record book champion but heart of a p***sy !
Why Nadal is not playing in the eveninig?Did you know that last 6 years when he played in the evening he lost everytime.Well fuckin' done AO,well done..............
Pathetic non competition, no Novak. Will go down as history as a sham.
Rafa to Shapo: Now son, let's take it easy.
Very gud Rafa .🥰❤👍👍👍👍👍
Hope Nadel goes on to win the tournament
Nadal will win the A O and will get  his 21 grand slam total..Its written all over..
Type your text and comment me San Mateo County USa ok ok i
Type your text and comment me San Mateo County USa ok ok i
Type your text and comment me San Mateo County USa ok ok i
They have already helped Rafa, kicking Novak. And there is more.... am I wrong?
rules only aply for unvaxxed people
Vaccines are making people ignorant paranoid aggressive and stupid.
Hard to believe, but some new players are taking after McEnroe  trying to turn this sport into a circus
Shapovalov is a little twerp and should have been DQ-ed for calling the Chair "corrupt".
0:50 That's when you know Capitalism has failed.  Quarter Finals of a Grand Slam and the Stadium is mostly empty because the seats are reserved for the 0,1%ers, that don't even care about Tennis.  While so many kids out there who are playing tennis that would be excited to be there aren't allowed.  DUMB DUMB DUMB Well that is Capitalism for you.
Nadal el consentido,ya saben xq
Bolje što Nole nije bio ovde...
Respect The Nads
Djoko Is the real winner.
Hey boy don't concern yourself with any  happenings at the other end ! Barty  doesn't  and wins sometimes
This needed context lol.
The AO is a cesspool of corruption just like the shit eating government.
Nadal getting preferential treatment as usual. In addition.. the umpire made it personal .   Dear Mr. Umpire... you're there to rule on the game.. nothing more so keep your glasses on and follow the damn rules.
AUSTRALIANS LITERALLY DOING ANYTHING JUST TO MAKE SURE DJOKOVIC WON'T OVERTAKE NADAL'S GRANDSLAM LMAO
I believe what shapo did was inappropriate and should have been penalized. If it had been Serena who did this it would have been a different story.
I am happy that Nadal won this match 👍👍👍
Que mal comportamiento de shapovalot definitivamente como Nadal y Roger no ay más tienen 1 tremenda educación que lastima que esta generación no agarren ese ejemplo
Por primera vez, bernardes tiene razón
more players need to complain about Nadals CONSTANT tactics of stalling on court... whenever they say Nadal played a 3 hour match, I yawn- 'well, 1 hour was spent picking his butt and 500 other ticks, so he really only played 2'
Hate when players blame everyone but themselves for why they are losing.   Rafa has been serving this way since forever..
Nadal is the biggest time waster on the tour. Everyone knows it. Not only that, when Nadal rightfully gets a warning (which is bizarrely, hardly ever) he spits his dummy out and threatens to have the umpire removed from any future matches he may be playing in. Nadal DOES get preferential treatment.
Does anybody know the name of Carlos' sunglasses?
La ATPdebe implementar la tarjeta roja para los jugadores maleducados  ofensivos   y mal ejemplo para el tennis mundial. Shapo. Debería ser multado y excluido por un año .por agresión .mal educación.  Negativa.vdsola me la tv amarilla lo puede apoyar tiene ser multado tambie
I think in my opinion is that Dennis went in this match on a high thinking that since he was playing so well and beating good players that he could just walk over Nadal, well Nadal is a champ and he plays with strategy not out there to show off. He taught you a lesson young man and if you think that you were going to bully him or intimidate him to play your style instead of his ,well he showed you he who is boss.Also Dennis is very rude and arrogant ,he needs to calm down and take a page from Felix how to be classy and humble.I hope they fine him for comments he made to Ump.when Serena had her issues  with the Ump everybody was on her case.  Double standard of  course
The "judge" Carlos does not know how to behave ...!!!!!!!!!
Ref was getting ahead of himself there. He wasn’t watching the clock but the player. First time I’ve seen a ref basically protecting the serving player taking too long.
I'm gonna predict that Nadel whooped his ass after that.
sore looser
https://youtu.be/UOlO9eyeMgY 😀
The bitch named Nadal was always gets the advantage of favouritism.
Mais um que quer " causar" e assim aparecer as custas do Nadal!! Eitaaaaa
Just hope nadal doesn’t collapse
Nadal Nadal nº1
Firstable he is addressing to one of the 3 greatness  of all time !! 20 Grand slams titles , show some respect. ( Federer Nadal jokovic)
I think no matter how long or rest you do, if you win you win. ✌🏿
Nadal é trapaceiro e desonesto!! Sempre da dessas ...
Who fuckin cares its tennis?
Shapovalov? More like Sharapova with his bitching
So, to sum up what happened here... Before the first game of the set, Shapo was ready to serve, the clock had long expired, and Nadal made him wait. Shapo told the chair ump, "you have to code him for that", which Shapo was correct about, because the server is supposed to set the pace. Carlos refused to give Nadal a warning, which Shapo was upset about. Shapo then got angry and said to Carlos, "you're all corrupt, you're all corrupt". Then they played Shapo's service game without further incident, which Shapo won.   Then they come out for this game, and Shapo is looking at Carlos, but not saying anything. So Carlos says, "what do you want me to do, he still has 8 seconds". To which Shapo had nothing to complain about, so he was throwing his hands up as if to say, "just forget it".   Nadal, meanwhile, has no idea what the heck is going on, so they meet at the net to let cooler heads prevail.
Fun fact: shapovalov is now the same age as nadal when they met the first time at the net, as fan and player in 2008.  Now almost 14 years later they met at the net again as players, for different reason.  Interesting
I felt Rafa was a bit rattled by this because after this his game was off for a while. His intensity was way down.
Shapovalov has a lot of growing up to do, but hopefully not in the way Novax Djocovid has!
Carlos has had it with these players and their bullshit.
Taking things a little personally?? What is a player doing saying WHAT???? to him. Nothing to take "personally" tf?
Rafa concentrates on tennis and improving his game.  That is why he has 20 slams.  He doesn't get drawn into these petty issues.  Shapo should just worried about his game and how to improve.
I watched whole match and umpire did give Nadal one serve time violation
shapo's got some stones
Friggin crybaby
Love to see one of these Karens in their place once in a while
corrupt
Dennis did not handle the moment well at all. ☹️
Dictatorship Open
Always these young players that are crying. These couple of seconds won't make a difference if you win a GS or not get that through your head.
Well, it’s a GRAM SLAM , 5 set matches, usually it takes 3 - 5 hours to win the game.  Why bother losing your concentration, wasting your energy for those few “seconds”.  I think it’s wiser just focus on the game, and I believe you will have better chance to WIN.
👍
Favouritism by a referee right here!
You don't mess with Nadal!
The umpire is so cool!!  I like that and also his answer!!  😃😃😎😎
Fun fact: You all ARE corrupt.
Stop this stupid siuuu thing. ronaldo sux. stupid Socceroos
شابوفالوف مريض نفسي
F Australian tyranny. Start Supporting freedom worldwide today!
lucky for ump Denis' pocket was empty.

Good on the Umpire. Shapovalov acted like a spoilt boy this game
Body language analysis: Ref is a child.
Nadal 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
Nadal was one moment away from saying "no no no Carlos no no no" 🤣🤣🤣
Ref was out of order making it sound personal & argumentative rather than calmly explaining the rule. Shap was within his right to question. The Ref has a heritage issue that means they don't do calm if questioned.
It is about time umpires in tennis talk back to these little beeachess! They complain too much. Hit the ball and play. You get paid win or lose...
0:35 The ref took the glasses out for watching Shapovalov running backward, when Nadal came to the next. Problems solved.
Wow big stuff !
The youngsters such a crybabies, nadal and Federer never complained in Young ages😂
0:38 Nadal: "Cocky Shapovalov, tell it to me. What's your problem?" Shapovalov: "Sorry man, I don't have the guts to tell it to you.. Just wanted to disturb you, but through the referee..."
Some players behave very immaturely. Rather than playing and try to win on court, they resort to invoking side shows antics. Some players have been professionals tennis players for over 20 years. Players have their uniques styles and presence in court. Nobody complained 20 years ago. Some of you want now to start talking rubbish.  Why didn't you complain many or about 20 years ago.
Es lo mejor de todos Nadal 😀
Loser.
This complaint was an attempt to disrupt the victor's rhythm, but it didn't work.
This is about the time when Nadal will use an injury as an excuse
Bog je veliki 🙏
Just make the slams best of 3 sets geezuz.  That will solve all the time problems.  It's very hard for anyone these days to spend 4+ hours to watch a 5 set match.  I think all the matches should be best of 3 and only the finals match be best of 5.  That ensures that both finalists arrive well rested and equally ready to play the best tennis possible.   It sucks when one finalist came out of a 5 hour grueling match and the other finalist breezes to the finals in 2 hour match.  One guy has nothing left in the tank while the other is fresh.  Doesn't seem right.
Rich considering Nadal is the biggest time waster in the history of tennis with his ocd serve ritual. But it's Nadal, so it's ok 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Carlos would of let Nadal take 3 mins to serve.
Interesting!  Frustration comes from many aspects of a match.
Always Bernardes amongst confusions
Thank god you lost
Shut your mouth Shapo
This kiddo should behave theirself🤮
Skandal
Nadal 👎
rafa a whole father in this clip with that ball bounce, casually calling denis over at the net and then the gentle calming shoulder touch
NADAL THE BEST !!!!!
ATP DARLINGS are Fedals and Rafa is now pushed to winn A.O. Rafa is full of steroides and winstrol testosterones but nobody control him. Roger is chemical industry for him self. No childern for so long than two times twince? Chance for that 1 in zillion of the trillions.
Totally disrespectful behavior. Good job Rafa keeping it cool. Win the final!!😊🥰🎾🤗😘💙💖⚘🌏
I love how Rafa takes charge and was able to calm Shapo down.  LEGEND.
Nadal wanted to make Shapo angry.  Mission accomplished.
Of course a "Carlos" will defend Nadal. Duh. Legend or no legend, this ump's got extra motivation.
These days we see rafa with more smiles and less anger.  He has grown beautiful 😊
POLEMICS...
J’ai pas compris « i didn’t understand »
Rafa takes the piss
With Tsitsipas everybody will have yelled at him telling he has bad sportsmanship and starting insult him. He would have get a code violation and maybe even two! That's just NOT FAIR (but guys, I have a lot of respect for Rafa, he's probably the greatest tennis player of all times!)
Everything is set up for Nadal to win this Australian Closed! This is disgrace for Tennis and sport generally. Send Novak home and win. This is the end of AO
Australia closed is not relevant anymore
BALD DAL is protected like BALD EAGLE 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Carlos scared of nadal
Nadal wanted to shake is hand..but shapo didnt
There is no point in watching this sport when the champion is not participating. Somehow tennis now seems like a poorly organized circus.
Nadal, siempre mañoseando...se sale con la suya. Mal.
Nadal the spineless boy who like to play at his bum and penis before he is ready for return or for serving. What a pity that Djokovic is not playing than we will see who is the real number one of the world in Tennis.😎
Nadal was one moment away from saying "no no no Carlos no no no" 🤣🤣🤣
If I was Rafa.... I would have slapped the lip off this guy's face.... But Rafa is Rafa... A thorough gentleman
And Tsitsipas got 2 Codes in 1 Game (still fair), but Nadal getting none is hillarious
Carlos reaction totally unprofessional
Djokovic the only GOAT
The ref needs to give Rafa the code violations. It's a torture test out there and the fittest survives.
Weird tournament, with weird people in a weird city
Где русскоязычные ? Что за ерунда ?
Umpire: "....what do you want!? (puny mortal)...you are disturbing him (Nadal).."  LOL!!!!🤣🤣🤣
Hard luck Shapo, you got cheated.
Nadal beckoning him to come to the net like a child.  Class.
“ Are you looking at me “ !  Like “ who the f*^% are you looking at “!
He tries to distract Rafael Nadal, but Nadal has a lot of experience dealing with such childish behaviour.
Everything is made up for Nadal to win this tournement. SO FAKE!
Bernardes is out of line. Lost his cool. Overcompensating because a few years ago he annoyed Nadal and Nadal banned Bernardes from working his matches.
Does anyone know the brand of sunglasses of the referee?
Why does it always have to be Carlos and Rafa 🤣
Nadal serving is like pogba taking penalties
Solo por lo que le dijo al juez de silla llamándolo corrupto tendría que haber dado el partido por finalizado a favor de Nadal.
Sinner > Shapapalovalovlov go home
Creo que Shapo solo quería sacar de  concentración a Rafa, que al final se demostró porque Rafa es el mejor. Se sentía Shapo muy seguro de ganar ya que venía de derrotar al #3, pero no le funcionó.
I noticed that Nadal slyly wets the ball with his one sweat to make the ball heavier in his serve. Is that cheating?
And when Rafa met him at the net for his uncalled wingeing Dennis just walk away! That’s what he gets bad karma ! Such a loser!
Novak Djokovic — champion,!
Rafa I🥰 kiss you thousend time, you are my favorite and best allways. Regards frpm🇫🇮
Bear in mind the history between Nadal and Carlos. My guess is the ump is a little gun-shy handing out code violations to this particular player...and Shapo called him on it.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😊   Its funny how Shapo started complaining to the umpire & then got called by Nadal & when Nadal started talking he was all shut up & just making vague gestures....  Its like, big brother has come...
this immigrant russian jew couldnt handle nadal
Shapovalov has some serious issues not to mention haha
what a stupid tournament without world no.1 and defending champion
When there was no clock...... Players used to complain... Now there is clock.. they still complain...  Just pure human nature.
Look at the empty seats, nobody is watching this shitshow anymore since the Djokovic political game. Australia embarassed itself on the highest level. Shane on you
Da ste dali Djokovicu da igra, ovih problema ne bi bilo.
Petulant child Shapovalov.
And where is the video that preceded this incident, where Shapovalov says that everyone in this tournament is corrupt! Censorship on Australian Closed continues, and the favorite of politicians is rushing towards the finals! He can become a Goat only by taking his panties out of his ass!
Ugh, Shapovalov is such a whiney douche. Complaining about every little thing when it’s not going his way.
We have to know that Nadal is chosen to win this year…..bloody politics
Rafa soon put the upstart in his place! Go Rafa!!!
1. Bernardes is the worst possible umpire for Rafa, if you know some tennis history 2. Bernardes did penalize him in other moments of the match 3. Calling the umpire corrupt should have actually got him defaulted  Just learn to lose. Your own brain is the cause of your defeat.
Есть особые теннисисты, которым всегда будет поблажка!  Надаль в их числе...
Das ist kein Sport mehr.Auf biegen und brechen wollen die das Nadal den 21Grand Slam holt.Djokovic habt ihr schon bei den US Open disqualifizerit weil er eine Linienrichterin getroffen hat,jetzt bei den AO geben die ihm das Visum ,dann nehmen die es weg ,dann wieder zurück und dann anschliessen nach Hause geschickt.Das ist eine Frechheit .
Nadal 😈
I’ll apologise but I’m not taking off my glasses
AO was corrupt and on Rafa sides.Thet medical redemption and toilet was to much.I don't watch the movie without main player.God bless you NOLE
#FreeWorldFuckAustralianOpen 🖕 Fck Nadal traitor 🤮
Nadal's Never-Ending Wedgie-Picking for 30 seconds is well known
We all know there is bias towards the top stars like Djokovic n Nadal coz they get away with fewer warnings! Obvious! Same with football with stars like Messi n Rinaldo who need a bit more protection coz they are so expensive but are lethal at winning!
Shapo is right !!! Nadal looks the dirty way to win every match !!
Nadal does wate  a lot of time with his pant pulling and nose and forehead motions - over 30 seconds.  Kyrios went at Nadal  many time on this.
Shapo just back off like nothing happened when confronted by Rafa 😂😅
Shapo is right. Fckng AO & fckng Nadal. They do everything to make Nadal the best of all time, but we all know that Novak is the greatest ever, as a tennis player and as a man. And no one except Novak haven't "the balls" to oppose the thieves of the ATP, so the ATP will do anything to destroy him , but God sees everything.
Nadal is always holding up players. Given you have to play to the servers pace Shapo should have just gone screw it you're not ready, too bad. Here comes a 200kph bomb.
Someone give Shapo a dummy so he can stfu and get on with the match. #FFS
Carlos se pone siempre más chulo que un ocho.
this is why tennis is so damm boooooooring
nadal was taking too long between points..it is 25seconds. He averaged like 40 seconds.
Same old story
Worst tournament this year.
Carlos is the worst umpire on tour, just piece of shit.
This is so disgusting to watch..well done Shapovalov for maintaining high level of play and enduring all this crap charade under scorching sun..thid is so sad and pathetic and certainly wasnt the first time
Bear in mind the history between Nadal and Carlos. My guess is the ump is a little gun-shy handing out code violations to this particular player...and Shapo called him on it.
Some strange things are happening on AO this year 🤔
SVE RADE DA NADAL IMA SVE BENIFICIJE,IGRA DANJU,NOC MU NIKADA NE ODGOVARA.ZAR ONA MINISTARKA NIJE VEC REKLA DA CE NADAL PODICI PEHAR?SVE JE JOS TADA BILO JASNO. DACE BOG DA GA NE PODIGNE
Problem isn't Nadal's first serve, its the time he takes between 1st and 2nd serves, typically anything 10 seconds plus. This needs to be addressed. Anyone can play for time and favoring Nadal because he is older/less fit is unfair.
The real’s world problems
Shapo bottled it when the big man stepped forward
Polska o co chodzi?
Heard your press conference Shapo, yes, U r so bang on,,, Rafa is irritating n steals away time n no one says a word. Moreover they all want him to win his 21st...so Dojo is left behind. This is his Golden chance, so even if he is last breath away, he will do whatever it is takes to win. Rules r literally broken (for him)
IMO this is why out of Fed, Nadal and Novax...I do not care how many more GS Novax or Nadal wins, they have bad gamesmanship and take advantage of the rules. Nadal is notorious for taking his time with his OCD, water bottles. Novax loves to bounce balls on and on and on in big points...sheesh just let your game do the talking.
Big brother, Young brother
Shapovalov...crying like a childrens
Shapola:- I lost becoz he took longer time to serve   Nice , young gen just keeping whinning all the time   Remember there were no restrictions in serve time some years back ... Keeping whinning buddy , but u lost to a " not 100% Nadal"
Lmao 🤣this is funny as hell tho.
Bruh.... If this "COMPLAINS" disturbs you.... Ur not mentally prepered to be at the top... Both Novak and Nadal has always been player that take extra time. Its their way of focusing.. The rival should take that same time to do the same... Novak, and Nadal have gotten strike for it to many times... I guess th umpire have given up and let's them to a limit obviously, if they get out of hand they will tell them.. Believe me Carlos has had his fights with Nadal to many times xD
0:42 Nadal and Shapovalov are supposed to be 6'1 both, but Shapovalov looks smaller than Rafa here like 5'11...
Nadal Bad guy!
It was bloody hot in Melbourne today, only an idiot would be playing tennis
Saludos hasta Guanajuato Dennis 😄😄😄😄
We don't talk about Bruno. 🤣
Nadal🤮🤮🤮
Always something wrong with this empire
Rafa gets extra time because he is Rafa!
Seems there is always one commonality with these players vs umpires...Carlos.
Great umpiring! Mr Shapovalov trying to put Rafa off of his stride but it backfired.lol.
rafael nadal, Mister Doping ... warum bei nadal keine Doping Kontrolle?  Unglaublich 🤷‍♂️  Ohne Doping wäre nadal Platz 100-200.  Unglaublich wie korrupt ist heutige Sport Welt ‼️  nadal 👎 Federer 👍   Grüsse aus Schweiz 🇨🇭

Don’t mess around with Carlos 😎 💪
Salvation  : 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,  that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting  life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the  world, but that the world through Him might be saved. 18 “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe  is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the  only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that the  light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light,  because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone practicing evil hates  the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be  exposed. 21 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds  may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.”...Jesus Christ  is the Savior and the Judge...Repent , for the Kingdom of Heaven is  near...Bible .
Carlos: Why u lookin at me! Sapo: Wanna to say Hi! coz u r looking at me👻👻
As long as the clock still there..you can take it as long as is this, famos Rafa
*To clear things up:* Shapo was wondering why Carlos was looking at him instead of the server, because he should be watching the server to ensure he doesn’t exceed his time, because he let Nadal get away with one late serve earlier in the match.  *Carlos:* “What do you want?” *Shapo:* “What are you looking at?” (As if to say, “You shouldn’t be staring me down, look at the server.”)
Nadal 👎👎👎👎👎👎
Что случилось? Объясните пж
This is childish by Denis, and so early in the match. Until he sorts his petulant temper he will never win a Slam or reach a final.
Don't bother, Nadal won't win the title...
Shapo, perdedor
Shapovalov very great step proving And so stunning. !
Master and commander Rafa
This doesnt look like a really professionnal umpire :(
I am not a lip reading expert but i am guessing what Rafa is saying at 0:29 "whats going on amigo "
Once Rafa & Roger retires, doubt i'll be watching Tennis anymore bc all that will be left are children throwing tantrum. Example is Shapovalov whining when there was still 8 secs left on the clock (tactic to get in Nadal's head bc he was losing). Glad Umpire (who gets into it with Nadal often) put Shapovalov in his place BUT every game is sth with these young players & I legit can't deal #smdh
Нихуя непонятно, но очень интересно 😂
Nadal saved the day. Defused the nonsense & match played on. If he hadn't, it probably would continued throughout the match 👍
What if the chair umpire is Carlos Ramos?
Nadal will be helped by all means to win 21st GS.
What did Rafa answer ??
Nadal is Nadal. Shapovalov's frustration is understandable.
Love, love, love Nadal. Hope he goes all the way.  Novak could learn A LOT from the man that Nadal is.
…ah
Nadal is the greatest cheater of all times. GCOAT!
Why you loocked me?  Why not? Wtf? WhY not?
AO2022 is a SCANDAL. No tennis player was supposed to come. Because everything is organized for Nadal to take the trophy. SHAME ON SPORT. Nadal is no longer an ATHLETE, but spoiled and complex.  AO2022 is a SCANDAL
How stupid looks Nadal has strikes me everytime. In more than 20 years he didn't manage to improve a bit his English..
I hate that umpire
Talk about Shapo,Does he really have a height of 6‘1？
Nadal needs 5 sets to beat this clown LOL Imagine what Djokovic would've done to these guys
ATP is corupted satanistic organization,need shut down this and remowe from white sport,this is shame, i dont watch ATP, because best player in the world dont play... ATP is comedy.
Look it is very simple, Nadal must (and will)  take this GS so that Djokovic can not become the best of all times. Medvedev will be disqualified in finals if he plays better then Nadal.
Nadal = drug man...
It's always about Carlos, maybe it's time to retire!
What a game.😭 Rafa😍
He saw Nadal 💪 coming to the net and he just went backwards
This is disgrace. Nadal takes too much time between serves, and he deserves a warning at every point. Carlos doesn't even want to say anything because he's a pussy and corrupted
Let the king do what he wants.
Надаль - молодец!!! Молодежь, учитесь манерам
Fun fact,: Shapo average Time was 29 and Nadal was 31
Pobjedi nadala
This was rude from Dennis. He was losing and was trying to get in Rafa's head. Carlos Bernandez and Rafa have many heated exchanges between them in the past for the time between points. It's not like he was trying to help Rafa in any way. After all,as Carlos told him, Rafa had 8 more seconds before Dennis started to complain.
Time for the Russian-Canadian to grow up and leave the tantrums to the Australian men who cannot play tennis.

Nadal is a coward !   Djokovic is the 🐐  🇷🇸
Medvedev will take care of Nadal. No #21 for him.

Nadal can't win on his own talent. He has to cheat! What a coward! Good for Denis!
Nadal started running well in the heat. Maybe he started using illegal drugs.?? Once WADA allowed him.
Exactly the reason why generations passed and can't beat the Big 3. They are a bunch of spoiled Brats, soft as hell, uncommitted and mega simps. Shapo behavior was totally SIMP. What an emotional prima dona. Stupid. Nadal, I got to GIVE it to him. That was EXTRAORDINARY. This is what absolute dedication, commitment and discipline look like. Nadal, a Warrior. My respects to the player. EXTRAORDINARY. ABSOLUTELY
Поясните для русского плиз
These tennis players play for hours under the hot sun! let them have their break in between serves. Its very annoying. Godd for Nadal. Shapo is hot headed.
Rafa played a dirty time match. Ao is corrupt
Shapo made his point when he complained. But to keep poking was disrespectful. Plus we all know Nadal has his little rituals. Also many tennis players have rules they stretch a little to help beat the opponent mentally. Breaks or whatever. It’s all part of the game. Being upset will affect your game too. Plus Nadal is too seasoned to be bothered by such pettiness.
Thanks God 🙏 🙏 🙏 Vamos Rafael!!! ❤ 😍
эх Шаповалов за такие слова ты должен был покинуть арену
nadal is a great champion, but man he sure isn't afraid to resort to scumbag tactics when it suits him. the whole serve clock idea was implemented because of him and his shameless time wasting between serves.
How can Sharpo say all of you are corrupt and not face any consequence? Does he mean the umpire has taken money and is favoring Rafa? Insane and immature claim to make as a professional tennis player
Dennis is a totally spoiled brat!! Whatever Dennis was trying to instigate, the Chair umpire shut it down.  Good.  Great match by the way!!
Djokovic Nadal 6 2, 6 1, 6 3! Nadal 5-7 games!
Shapo should have said: "I'm looking at you cuz I love you 😘"
There should have been a dance off at the net ...waat ! Waat !!
Congrats Rafa! Looking forward for the next match. And Shapavalov has some great potential, he’ll be winning GS sooner than later.
Shapofailov has left the European Supremacy-app
Че они там говорили друг другу? Что за кипиш
Congratulations Nadal! Well done!👍
Now 6 European man. 1 Canadian. what a sport?
RAFAEL WON IN A FIVE SET THRILLER. Congrats to both men.
Nadal faking injury again...Was just waiting when he would pull that card after Shapalov started playing better. Shaparov beating himself with countless unforced errors after Nadal made him wait on court. Now easy undeserved walk trough against easiest remaining opponent Berittini.
Nadal muppet
Anyway, AO shouldn’t sell the broadcast rights to tvN next time. tvN is CJ company’s channel in Korea mostly broadcasts entertainment show. They got right to broadcast AO in this year(last year was Rolland Garros), and we couldn’t watch the AO because tvN is now streaming an entertainment show, mostly. Now we can’t watch the QF match between Nadal and Shapo. tvN is messed up. It sucks.
Now Nadalphobics going to evade comment box against him.
As a Nadal fan, this was the most horrible Tennis match i ever watched. Nadal first passive and after injured nearly not moving in the court. Shapovalov making many errors.   Never a top player has as many chances to win against Nadal. Nadal proved enormous strength.
I love Shapovalov!  ❤
Nadal, ganará
Once again Rafa had all the easy games in this  Aus Open .....
The chair umpire should be a bit more professional, you can't respond like that. It looks like Shapovalov got into his head haha.
As Shapovalov said to the Chair Umpire - "You are all corrupt" sums up the whole Novak Djokovic fiasco that was strategically planned by the AO to diminish the chances of Novak in winning his 21st Grand Slam title. Nadal allowed in eating up performance enhancing pills under the pretext of an ache and taking long breaks when he is about to lose, it is pretty obvious to understand the lobby that is influencing the management of the AO.  In spite of this, I still reaffirm that Novak Djokovic will be and is the Greatest Tennis Player of all time and he shall reign over the most slam titles in history.
5th set on-going
The ref started the short clock late too. So maybe that’s why it felt longer than the clock led us on
Rafael Cheatal😠🤮
Umpire being unprofessional
Carlos always has a thing v. RAFA. He shouldn't be on his matches.
The chair ump told Shapo not to call him Carlos, but to call him Eduardo 😂😂
Nadal just wants to finish game and go to bed
"Carlos! Voy a pedir che no me arbitre mas".... 😂😂😂
Rafa starting his tricks in the 5th set again....
this nadal takes half an hour to serve, while performing all his rituals. go to a psychologist for your obsessive compulsive disorder. 🙄🙄🙄 shapooo 💪🏻🙌🏻
Rafa always gets special TREATMENT, he should be punished for taking so much time
yes nadal cheating again. it's a common occurrence.
in first set Rafa totally slowed the game and broke Shapo's rhytm and that was allowed by Carlos Fenandez who always turn on the clock couple of seconds  too late , thats way Shapo was so pissed off , he was stanidng on the hot sun every time n Rafa's serve for 30 sec and more
Carlos was taking his sun glasses off just in case there's a ball coming through.
Shapov should hit ball unpire.
Shapo might smack a ball in Carlos face 😂
It’s ok rafa dont bother you have 20…
What happened to Shapo and Referee. Pls explain somebody
Puno gladaoca😜👏👏👏
It's all set Nadal to win
Way to not make it sound like you're corrupt by snapping at a player as chair umpire.
Here is the most important detail that is apparently deliberately being left out while talking about what Shapo said ("you're all corrupt"):  Shapo is ready to serve but Nadal is not ready (not the first time until then), so he goes and complains to the umpire. The umpire muffles "well you're not ready either".  Shapo goes to back to serve but turns around to state his point further and the umpire now clearly says "you weren't ready either".   The umpire was basically saying Shapo wasn't ready because he was complaining to the umpire, completely ignoring the fact the Nadal was not ready well before Shapo decided to walk to the umpire. It is a blatant misrepresentation of facts and that does amount to being 'corrupt'.  And as for the clock having 8 seconds, well, that's because *when* the clock starts is still under the umpire's discretion and he just wasn't starting it soon enough.
Carlos Bernardes the "best friend" of Rafa so far...
どういうことです？ 説明欲しいです🙏
Gabas is at home saying “Carlos… don’t get Shapo angry!”
I’m not sure who’s worse: Carlos or that Irish potato legs guy that King Kyrgios despises
Pretty reckless to call someone corrupt for everyone to hear.
You gotta stay away from Nadal. The players say his presence is too big and intimidating in the dressing room. Ignore him best you can. No talk, no meeting. Don't look at him if you want a chance.
日本人説明して下さい
Shapov is planning to hit the umpire again.
Aim at Carlos' eyeball socket Shapo lol
Nadal is known to take long time before serving. This in my opinion is tactical to disrupt the opponents rhythm and make the opponent wait and get agitated by it which in this case worked perfectly as he intended. Shapovalov needs to be smarter and not fall for this trick. After all it's all mindgame played by Nadal. You have to beat him in tennis as well as mindgames to win.
Хрень
I don't really like Carlos as the chair umpire. He's actually making decisions from out of this world
why is Carlos escalating the situation? know your place and count the score.
That ref is annoying leave shapo alone his mine charrrr 😂😘
Isn't he the fellow who temper tantrumed the chair umpire in the head with the ball during a Davis cup match?
The worst part about Shapo's game is that he's always whining about something :(  Just like Andy Murray, looking for excuses for why they're losing. But he's still one of my favorite players :D Beautiful to watch that ball striking
Carlos isn’t going to say anything to Nadal lol.
This tournament was rigged for Nadal to win it, it is boring to watch (in fact, first time in years I haven't seen a single game in the whole tournament, just barely 1 set of Cilic yesterday).......when they forced Djokovic out so Nadal can have a GS to compensate the one he couldn't win in Roland Garros last year, they lost all credibility
Shapo: Why can't you just ban all the big 3s from the event so we can have a new Champion?   Umpire: What?  Shapo: What?
Shapo was about to smash the umpire with a ball again 😂
Scoundrel! On the game prove that you are stronger and do not do meanness!
Djokovic!!!!!!💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
☺☺☺☺☺
So, to sum up what happened here... Before the first game of the set, Shapo was ready to serve, the clock had long expired, and Nadal made him wait. Shapo told the chair ump, "you have to code him for that", which Shapo was correct about, because the server is supposed to set the pace. Carlos refused to give Nadal a warning, which Shapo was upset about. Shapo then got angry and said to Carlos, "you're all corrupt, you're all corrupt". Then they played Shapo's service game without further incident, which Shapo won.   Then they come out for this game, and Shapo is looking at Carlos, but not saying anything. So Carlos says, "what do you want me to do, he still has 8 seconds". To which Shapo had nothing to complain about, so he was throwing his hands up as if to say, "just forget it".   Nadal, meanwhile, has no idea what the heck is going on, so they meet at the net to let cooler heads prevail.
Esto es lo que provoca la demora para sacar de Nadal, que hasta hay tiempo para pelearse😆😆
shapovalov sometime need to stfu and just play
Common people let Rafa smel his own underwear...
I think shapovalov SETTING LOVE WITH EYES TO CHAIR UMPIRE....🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😋😋😋😋😋😋
Nadal takes like a hundred years for first serves and another seventy years for second serves. It’s so annoying to watch.
Watch this match with a mirror if you feel they hold the racket with the wrong hand.
My respect for Thanos grows each day
Shapo, I wish you did not say the word "corrupt"...
shapo looks veri gay the way he walks and talks. always barking. just go to sleep kid. old man rafa bounce bounce pick his butt bounce bounce is killing u
coolest carlos moment
Umpire: Why are you looking at me? When there are still 8 seconds (on the clock) to play. What do you want? Shapo: I... (just want to win)
lmao what did denis say at the net
😂
Shapovalov crybaby. Come on Rafa for title🙏
Que mal juez, mostrando la hilachaa jaja
That was cringe
誰か翻訳して
1 swing and Shapo is out
Shapovalov : Showing the time. Ref : What do u want ?? u know u gonna lose that game.
The ump bout to beat his ass had too take off the shades
Shapo looked at the ref because he wanted him to say something about Rafa taking so long to serve, but the ref responded by saying don’t look at me, there’s a shot clock.
Sounds like Carlos Bernades threw off everything. Because Shapo “looked at him”
If only Nadal had taken a swing on him. Shapovalov has an attitude problem that guys like me are good at fixing.
why???
Shapovalov wanted Carlos to say something about the time and then when Carlos called him out on it and zaddy saw, he acted like he didn’t have a problem with it 🤣
What’s going on?
?
lol why both Nadal and Shapovalov are met? 🤷
What's happen ??
