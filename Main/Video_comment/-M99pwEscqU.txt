Why does GTA still lag for Tobi and Harry man. Do something about it please! It does not feel like a fair game with them lagging and the rest playing smoothly.
the kanye poster didnt age well also kon wheres my setup
kon dont ever cut with a saw ever again
borat made me sub, lol
2:53
Lewis Maria Martinez Michael Moore Betty
one day im gonna have this too
You need labels on all those plugs to know what is what if you need to unplug something. Will be a nightmare otherwise
I love how Tobi is the only one to stay with Kon to keep him company most of the time
Fair play Kon, fair play👏👏👏👏👏
Kon what is the best pc mouse and keyboard for beginner
ive watched maybe 5 videos. im not understadning the immense praise here. hes just putting a desk together and cable managing it. am i missing something here? not hating just honestly confused.
the triple superwide monitors are too much
he could have opened the table by putting the monitors on a Desk mount
The chest of draws under the desk doesnt look good and doesnt look particle, id recomend putting to side so you dont boot it when feet under desk ect
What are those things that you stuck to the desk to hold the cables down? I would love some of them, currently using tape lmfao
I mean u could have got a bigger desk, would be veeerryyyyy nessecary
Kanye poster didn't age too well xD
Kanye poster💀
Be honest, were you really proud of that setup, with the screens hanging out of the edge and even the legs of the screen? And why do Tobi even want two screens that are angled that way? 😅
I think Tobi has the best setup, it’s nice and humble
It would look cleaner with a monitor arm
pog
Love your vids Kon, really inspiring
Kanye painting update?
me and tobi have the same pc case
Me with a 1.5k vacumm
Series: Building all the members of the sidemen a setup.
i have the same vacuum too 😂
MY DREAMS WONT BE REAL UNTIL I GOT THAT NEAURALINK LOL
I feel that Toby's Setup was the best setup before makeover (compared to any1 elses)
I always see his set up video cause of cable managements
that Kanya poster didnt age well...
watching this in december 2022 seeing a kanye poster😬😨
That Kanye pic did not age well.
Where did he get the purple Led T Behind his setup? Pls answer if anyone knows
It’s time for a update look for his and Harry
Where is the Velcro ....not cable ties???
I want the moon
I think kon forgot to edit this video
power bricks for monitors? where is that for if i may ask
Kon come to Australia to upgrade my set up xx
Ending song name? 🎵
I've got exactly the same keyboard as Tobi
funny how his office is bigger than my bedroom
I need Kon to come fix my room... i don't  even know where to start
Bedroom.
Anyone know the monitor name?
Kon is so underrated he practically does everything in the sidemen
Is it true that 21 savage and tobi are related?
Heych DMI
The view tho
I have the same Hoover as them
tobi is such a vibee
the welcome at 15:10 made me laugh so hard. damn. when u comfortable u comfortable no denying that.
this man makes amazing music videos , can do daily vlog type videos for other people , good with cameras , and makes amazing gaming/ streaming setups
Monitorarms, monitorarms....
brooo the intro music from the loading screen of mxgp  2020!!
why are his monitors at such a sharp angle
@konstantin Minus the pc, how much would it roughly cost to have a set up like this?
Can you tell me what kind of led lights was used in this video
When the monitor power blocks heat up will that not compromise the stick on the velcro strips?
These people are making bare 💰but still have their PC's setup in their bedroom...  It blows my mind!!
anyone know the song at the end? its such a relaxing vibe
to make a desk look cleaner drill a hole in the desk to route the keyboard and mouse wires down and the put the mouse pad over it
Kon your setup is good but you can try something different instead of giving every sideman the exact same setups
Tobi is such a good person and desverse this so much.
90% of the video out of focus
when I he said "most expensive suck I ever heard of" I liked the video immediately
Hi Kon
I actually love tobi yk he’s such a legend and he seems so nice as well he also reminds of a kid aswell 😂 bc of the shoes he watches like SpongeBob or Simpsons and the fact he called his old setup the spaceship is just funny 😂
Goals: get a million subs over the next year, then pay to fly Kon out to the US to do my setup lol
No Kona hit a million and gone well over
seeing tice art at 16:11
😢
1:53 That camera looks siiickkkk🤯🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Kon is so underrated bro
Spaceship mark.2
the moon is 99 quid
Neat!!!
you are lucky to have a friend who is thoughtful!
shoutouts the camera... out of foucs
naw man tobi c'mon bruh
Does anyone know where you can buy a net like that for the cables
This man needs a 49’ g9
Please come to my house and build me a set up looks amazing haha!!
Should put the monitors on arms would make so much more space and a bigger desk
u guys realize that he is not doing it for free!?
can we all agree that when the upload our day gets better? ❤️
Great video 🙂❤️👍
Does anyone know what desk he has?
hw should put a big tv above his setup so it can be a hang out room too
Does anyone know that instrumental at 10:20? So smooth 😭💜
Nice job on hoebi’s room!
dahell is haich d m i
Me when I realise the moon is 200aud 😐
5:29
Tobis electricity bill must be over the moon
Looks like weed growing room 🤣🤣
This is sick bro❤love from Sa
I wanna know what types of these monitors  ?
Tobi is someone we all want to be friends with
This mans work rate all the sidemen moving and he still has time to do all the set ups for em
jeez that moniter hang get a biger desk my guy
i wish i had a friend like kon
And still your GTA lags 😂😂😂
i wish you could do my desk its a mess
Phone mount?
we have the same keyboard
Electric bill must be mad
kon is really the best friend you can ask for, really a great man!!!
this video made me think i need a Setup asap...
Cap, there aint no way this was 1 year back
CON knows his shit on this stuff  , I have trouble with my X BOX 🤯
the fact Kon doesnt know who Handsoap is. disgraceful.
We love Tobi, and Kons work etc, but as a cable person etc, Tobi's set up stresses me out, there so much 😭
i would prefer to do it myself because then its more rewarding
where did tobi get those posters, they look sick!
Do you think the BMPCC is better or the Sony A6300?
is that a office office
juan
Okay he dont like his old setup fam im with a 300 dollar computer i got from some random dude from facebook i cant even run games on it i always wanted a good pc i could play games if you dont know what roblox is i play that everyday i cant even play crab game cause my pc over heats playing it
Wow.
Looks really great, but i would mount the side monitors on the wall so he has more desk space
Ey Tobi have the same desk as i and the same PC
I’ve got the same vacuum
where did he get the anime poster, I am a big fan of one punch man and naruto
PC Set up minimum cost $7055.88 AUD, that's fucked
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely NEED to know where that kanye canvas is from
I am betting those power bricks will fall off after some time, because they are both heavy and get warm...so the glue will give away over time.
bro i have that exact same shirt !!! are they work much !?
Yo Kon. Come down the Georgia, USA and help me with mine please! 😂😂 actually tho that would be sick.
The view from tobis offfice is nuts
You should try a monitor mount and put one diagonal it will look a lot better with the space you have
Kon is the best cameraman
A beg some one tell me where to get the left anime portrait at 15:16 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
The amount of videos like these we’re about to see now that all the sidemen have bought their own houses 🥳
i got the same vacuum
I notice Tobi wearing the shirt Simon gave him
'Heich' dmi
I got the same vacuum lol
And he still don’t stream
Can I a get a dream setup I’d be cool with a tv and an Xbox haha
What is that microphone placement!? :'(
1000nth comment!!!
Unsung hero of sidemen
i hate how those monitors sit on the very edge of the desk with the actual monitor hanging over
Love it
This is amazing
Kon’s a goat for putting tobi’s pc parts on screen
Kon is the most underrated YouTuber and cameraman ever
Big up tobi being the only sideman that helped kon for the setup and getting the lunch
Dont get the reference for 6:32 in regards to danny boyle?
Man I need Kons magic hands fr, Big transformation go crazy!
Sidemen+kon=family
even after this setup he lags in crab game
Does he have Ethernet cable or is he playing with wifif
Where did you get the cable manegment net
i am hiving major anxiety one tap on the monitor and its going down
not gonna lie the room looks fire, but the setup needs alot of work
hahaha 3:22 he really left him hanging
I have the same hoover
Honestly the g413 is the best keyboard, wouldn't ever change it
That Kanye poster fire
@konstantin how much for you to help me with my setup and cable management? lol
Desk ???
Geeeez  loookin sick ya know wish con could that for me
does anyone know what kon uses for the cable management at 11:32
KON-GRATULATIONS ON 1.1MILLION SUBS!
Jokes cus the moon doesn't spin
IVE GOT SAME hoOVer lets goooo
if you're gonna have 3 ultrawides like that and not get a bigger desk top. at least get like 3  desk mount monitor arms for like 60 each. but that's just my opinon. feel he has no desk space with those stands lol.
Tobi should get monitor mounts
Elite
Desk needs to be bigger
Kon is a legend
"Did you just call me a massive brick" hahaha
I’ve got the same huver lol
What desk does Tobi have
If he needs a painter and decorator let me know 😉
Subscribed just bc of this
toby has the same keyboard as me
We have the same hoover lol
He goona get 10 000 dollar electricity bill per month bro
Thanks for the video
I just realized I have the exact same desk. It's a really nice desk.
17:29 Tobi's got mad wrinkly hands fam. What is he, 60? 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
5:14 I swear there is a pair of these scissors in every british house hold hahaa
Hey Kon,  Can we get a link to the table please?
Kon: "And each monitor comes with this massive brick..." Tobi: "Did you just call me a massive prick?"  Classic tobi 🤣🤣
If he makes mistake, one of the monitors could easily fall.
ayyyy kon got 1 mil
Except the Cable managment errthin looks insane
5:38
4:40
1k more to a mil
W
I really like the office Tobi, I wish I had something similar. btw well done Kon
big up naruto fans
Less than 4k subs away from 1 mil
Anxiety for those monitors
"I tried it the other day and kinda liked it" 😉😉
Am I the only one getting mad that they didnt put the desk on the other side
He already had a great setup and now… even better
Where can I buy his monitors I don’t even have a pc yet but I am getting into that stuff and I’m only 12 so saving for that stuff is going. To take ages
Tobi doesn't use coasters for those cans? EEEEEEEEE
Kon: Day 2, he not fed me any water. Lol
You should use smart power strips for cable management it works with voice assistants
I think Tobi should get a custom keyboard from Taeha Types
what is the the thing on the wall called
I am sad that his Pc is on carpet
what was the thing all of the cables were tucked into
some people: 2 monitors others: 1 ultrawide tobi: 3 ultrawide
Enjoyed this! Recently finished my office and cable management is a ball ache but satisfying once done
9:27-9:30 tourette schanppwfkn monemy
He should really put 2 of his monitors side by side and then the third one on top of them
Anyone know where he got those led floor lamps from? (The ones by the sofa)
what are the tube lights called? where can i buy from?
Get this man 1 mil subd
Bro this set up looks mental, so sleek b. Watched your other setup videos aswel, that Lambo wallpaper man! Looking forward to watching a video of you setting up Simons Studio!
love u kon my russin brother
Kon is the most underrated human to walk this earth. What a legend.
Gaming monitor and an Ultrawide for personal use. I would like that.
Anyone know the exact make/model of screens. LG?
Kon has to be a little jealous😀
The fact that the left screenstand is a bit over the edge of the desk... big oooof....
I don't like the cable management
where did you buy the table?
proably should have gotten a bigger desk LOL
what desk does Tobi have?
Where the tube lighting amazon link at? (:
I think the table is too small for the monitors
what a great outcome.
Hedge DMI port
Link for buying the floating moon lamp?
That poster is sick
wait....... tobi wears shoes inside????!!!!!!!
Didn't know he's also a professional organizer
Where’d you get that desk?
If I have to name the best duo’s they would be: Kon and a camera
Personal opinion: The office setup is amazing. However, for better workability, the two ultra-wide monitors would offer greater aesthetic and functionality side by side without the centre monitor. You could however place the centre monitor above the two monitors to avoid knocking over the side monitors. Great content though.
My guy is just an all around package
Come to Norway and do my setup pls :=) I cba myself :)
Love this series, all these setup upgrades look awesome
Dem man did peak day 60 minute makeover 🤙
The imaginary air subjectively yell because lemonade ophthalmoscopically deliver minus a cheap fish. wistful, gullible gusty lizard
I wish I had a set up like that it’s amazing
Real plants would have been better!! Looks great guys. I cant stand seeing cables everywhere cable management is so essential
Let’s get con to 1 mil
900th comment.
I would live to get a setup by them it would look insane
Kon in Tobi's vid at the end toby was talking about a setup build for a subscriber how do we enter
7:45 a high end build and u lacking the exhaust fan. bruh hahahah
I have the same vacuum as you.  ✅😂😂😁😁
FROM DA EAST TO DA WEST
This is sick. You did a phenomenal job.
Can anyone tell me the desk and mic arms please ?
Big up Kon !!
1 mill coming sooonnnn
𝙋𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙚 𝘾𝙝𝙚𝙘𝙠 𝙈𝙮 𝙑𝙞𝙙𝙚𝙤𝙨.... 𝙋𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙚  Once🙏❤ ●●●
Kon.. You are amazing! You Seem like such an amazing guy. I have the most respect for you and What u do
6:49 “someone’s gonna have to pick that up aren’t they Kon”  drops the rest on the floor anyway 😂😂😂🤦‍♂️
Legit best setup I've seen
I'm new to your stuff but I like it.
Never thought I'll be saying this but damn Kon, you are hella talented doing all that tech stuff. Keep up the good work man! Road to 1 mil👏🏾👏🏾
Kon, what desk was used for this?
That is shit cable management
Kon what are those sticky strips you're using, I can only ever find the small weak command strips.
How does kon not know who hanzo is disgusting fire him
Love you Kon <3 <3 <3
Idk why but with the purple lights it looks like a weed room🤣
Kon is god
Tobi has such an awesome view from his flat
when will jj get a new setup???
fucking hate the way he says “here”
How am I not subbed?
I can’t believe he has three of my old monitor since I just switched to the LG 38 GN950-W.  £3K right there just in the monitors.
I subbed can I have a free set up mate
W! Tobi ideal could help a lot of fans and upcoming YouTubers
I want led lights so bad but they are quite pricey
What’s the purpose of having a web cam and a actual camera
One day
He needs to cop either small monitors or a bigger desk asap
Please tell me you don’t actually have a 3.5” drive in that insane computer, he can get a 4tb nvme with the bread he makes, HDD in 2021 is wild kon
Anyone know where to get that under desk cable management pouch??
I need this big up Con and tobs ❤️
What a humble vid👍👍
mannn i love tobi❤❤❤❤
Your really talented my guy🙌🙌❤
what desk is that, i need one like that!
Me wanty
So close to 1mill!!!
absolute smashing job!!! I need a setup like this!
That View from that window though 😍
Your doing a wonderful job. Doing shoots for sidemem, managing your own channel, doing edits and stuff nothing to belittle. Plus he's doing a fabulous job with everything he gets his hands on.   King T'Challa commands you "get this man to a million!!"
You know your stuff inside out...competent as they come
Kon: I'm going to get one of these floating moon things. Tobi: Everyone's going to get one.  Me: *Sees price of them* Me: and I'm out 🤣
I rate kon a lot and the office looks very nice
what is on the screen at 16:31
Your videos are fire brooo! I've found your chanel like year and a half ago and I support you since this day. Keep doing it!
I dont like how the monitor is so close to the doorway, however everything is lit!
why do british ppl still say Haitch... its pronounced aitch
kon is acc such a klm guy
Could you make a tutorial using simon's setup, like one to help people know how to buy and set up a smart home
I'm so confused, am I the only person who doesn't wear shoes in my own house?
Mans got a nice setup but that keyboard
someone needs to hook tobi up with a nice mechanical keyboard... like a proper one
7:45
Looking like a crop😂
Tobi deserves this.
Pov: the video recommend under this is "tbjzl $10,000 room setup tour"
Konstantin the only guy who can Vlog and work at the same time!
Kon is a life saver
Nice set up
Kon I love the transformations!  Wish you could change my room!
This setup is so sick
Best camera man on the platform and a really good friend for the sidemen and all the members hope you make all your dreams and live the best life of all time
J
Dyson V11 is elite not gonna lie, my best investment 🙈😂
Hello Kon
333
Toby a real one✊🏿
make some more of this type of vids please
What desk is that?
Elite content
dont buy no weed from the gas station
”Did you just call me a massive prick?”😂
Me & my homies vining to the tune at 9:30
Kon , I wanna win this setup, you gotta tell tobi to ship to Trinidad
The new setup would be an incredible chance for me to launch my dream
Kon its random but my nandos order is also double chicken wrap medium xD
I love this new series!! Keep going, cant wait for simons studio video
Kon is just so nice and calm much love!
SO FIRE! New youtube series inbound!!
Tobi's humour 😂  Massive Prick 😅
Kon makes the best setups on YouTube no cap
Who the tf disliked this video
Electricity bill 📈📈📈
Wow, nice job
Something about office tours and updates makes it super entertaining😂
No one: Kon every 2 minutes: CABLE UPDATE 😂
He need a monitor stand
Ksi next?
I really wish I could get the dream set up but I know I won't. It was worth a try
i didnt know kon had a channel, lets go
If I ever make it on YouTube can I have you as my camera man please mate.. respect to you man 👍
Kon should be in the sidemen
Pimp my vibe
underrated
Kon is the best
What was the cable hider that you used for the base of the walls? I can't seem to find one quite as clean looking.
BIG up Kon🙌🏽👑
What can’t this man do
DO KSI's SET UP
Everyone needs a friend like Kon
bro keep on doing the good work until you reach your goal ,,,,much love my G
yo Kon, my nan need a light bulb changed, when can you get on it mate?
Tobi being happy makes us all smile.
*Vacuum gang* got same vacuum as you both still 😂
this is poggers
Yay Kon the Destroyer (fixer)
Dyson v11 great vacuum but only downside being you have to hold the power button the whole time and boy it gets painful
I wish I lived in the UK and knew you so I could help record and help
GREAT VIDEO MATE
Tobi got the school keyboard 😂😂😂😂
This setup is pretty great but he definitely needs a bigger desk
You're 100% welcome to pimp my vibe
ayy it’s tobi from sidemen
Didn’t skip the integration this time as well bro. Got you KON!
Am I the only one bothered that the storage drawers are right in the middle of his desk? No leg space it looks like lmao
kons outro music is harddd
amazing setups..would be nice if you guys link the setups
From where did he get his anime poster?
The nanoleaf intersecting the boot doesnt look right to me
Next ksi
When is kon becoming a sideman lmao
Kon I wanna come round my house and fix my setup I got all the stuff I just need LEDS and everything cool jk love the work tho Kon keep it up
THAT KANYE POSTER🤩
Step Brothers.... :)  "So much room for activities"
Tobi Is like one of the most wholesome people
Can you do a video on stuff setup should have? As well as good equipment needed?
Here to help u get to 1 Million Subs 👌 I know I'm just one person, but I hope this makes a difference 👍 & u did an awesome job on TBJZL brand new set up on his channel 👏👏👏👏
Everyone needs a friend like Kon.
This is legit a dream setup I pray one day I get one close to this level 🙏
You are so talented it’s crazy !
JJ needs a new setup
Where did you get those tubes for cable management because i need those.
Beard game defo not strong 🤣
Some man for one man, Kon 💪🏻😊
Also big up Kon, he’s a real friend 🙌🏼
Love this but it made my head hurt where they positioned the desk in the room…. The layout of the room gave me anxiety 😂 they should have moved the couch, the desk should have gone where the couch is with the wall in the background. Couch could either have gone on the opposite wall or in front of window like a window seat. I just ain’t digging the flow they went with here in all honesty 😅 really did give me anxiety!
This set up is what I need 🙏
I'd die for a setup like this lol
This is so sick! Really looking forward to you doing Simon's studio!
Hyyy that would be so sick if I had my own dream pc gaming setup
You do this for free?
Tobi was kinda pushy yk
Good vid but you uploaded it before tobi
You should wait for Toby to upload his video first, you fraud
You should do vik as well he needs it
I want a friend like Kon.
Yoo Kon can you help me build my dream set up I would really appreciate it !?
How did you get it so that the camera didn't produce LED flicker?
The amount of effort detail and time kon has put into Toby’s new setup is crazy such an underrated content creator keep up the good work man ❤️
Genuinely love this Kontent!!
Kons obsession with standing desks is too much
If you aren't subscribed to kon then please do. He is such a great guy and really deserves it
Caple work was on point man. What a grafter 👊
Big up for tobi for framing simons gift to him on the wall ( Bruno’s signed boot ) 🤩
Yeah
Please pimp my setup 🥺 if you did it would mean a lot to me.
So cool! Well done man !!
Kon does above and beyond. He deserves all the attention
Man you dont know how much i love and respect kon for like he really helps alot hes like  when you have a hard group project and relaize that you have Kon and everything gonna be okay I just found out your channel but seen you in sidemen videos and them channels imma watch ur videos until i fall a sleep G.N
45k left till Kon is at 1mil
Nice casting couch
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” he loves you and will always be there for you guys no matter your situation have a great day.
I want 3090
Your such a legend kon! Everyone needs a kon in their life🙌
Kon got stuck under the table... Tobi come to unstuck kon
Cool 😎

I AM TRYING TO GET INTO STREAMING AND YOUTUBE BUT DONT HAVE TO SETUP TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. IT WOUKD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. KEEP DOING U BRO  THANK YOU ❤

I LOVE THESE, KEEP THEM COMING
That's a sick setup! 💯 And the whole office thoo🔥🔥
Get my man to 1 Mil! ♥️
Love this video, only thing that was missing was a shot from the back gopro showing the setup
Wow saw like 4 of Simon's gifts to Tobi!!!
Can u do ksi setup please
Bro lets get this mahn to a million his channel is just getting more and more addictive
How much do u get paid to do this stuff
Do u get paid to do the set up????
U don't get enough credit
Love the setup
Amazing job bro
Bro 20/10
big pogg
Kon if you make a series that would actually be a banger, "building the sidemens dream setup" or "building famous youtubers dream setup (callux and randy)" then if you run out of sidemen ones, you can update them after a year or 2 to make it even fancier. Or if you wana go extra you should do "building sidmens dream rooms"
Amazing
Hi
Great Video Kon👍 Can’t Wait To See The Studio Video👀
I love how no one is noticed that he’s got crap on his shirt
Fun fact, me and Tobi own the same exact vacuum cleaner
Where’d he get the Kanye poster?
"Did u just called me a massive prick?" LOL
I was gonna comment, you look like a hobo please shave but now I'm gonna say, that office looks sick.
This is the best cameraman ❤️
thats a dream set up right there
SOOOOOOOOOO MANYYYYYYY WIDEEEEEEEEEEEE MONITORSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
how to tobi something: just put apple juice and sweets in the room
Respect Kon! Really proud of what  path you've come through and thank you for staying humble and doing your work on the highest level👍
Big up Kon🙌🏼
POV:ur from watching sidemen Sunday and then this video was recommended next😹
10:52 use ur imagination, i sure will ;)
Big self moving camera but can't focus it is that what were on Kon?
Anyone know where you get that moon decoration that Tobi has at the end
My keyboard the the Razer Blackwidow Tournament Edition Chroma V2 and it's so good
I badly wanted to see that GoPro shot but didn't show it..... dammnnnn
That United shirt is 🔥🔥
Lmao the floating moon👀
That hanzo piece is very sick
7:15 Borat reference ey!
Tobi coming through the best payment for kons hard work:  Nando’s and a video  Nice!
Big ups Kon, man's knees were all red and messed up from being on the ground for so long. The dedication this man has is unreal!
banger!!
I’m bare jealous yano 🤣 what exact keyboard is that, that Tobi has? I low-key want it
Yes let’s see simons set up
name of the Kanye West poster?
Hopefully he no longer uses a green screen
This was a better quality video than the current Sidemen Sunday. Damn
Bro having a setup like this is a dream come true
The vibe is the room looks amazing! You've done a great job
buy a wireless mouse
kon you could always route the keyboard and mouse cables together and off the desk in one place or you could drill through the desk under the mouse pad and run them through and under to give it the more wireless look. but good job with the vid bro!
14:29 tobi sounds like a little kid he looks so happy
Where is that table from?
1:54 *cues camera gimble advert* rest of the scene isn't focused
The one monitor reaching over the table edge is completely destroying My soul
i love when kon do these vid this video is lit
Kon: (setting up whole pc setup) Tobi: (what should I get from Nando’s)
Loved this video Kon 👍👍
Satisfying
Can't wait till we see Simon's studio setup makeover
This was sick 👌🏽 Can’t wait for the studio build for Simon!
wtf is wrong with youtube why does kon has ONLY 900K SUBS  WTFFFF
Kon to 10 mil 🚀
anyone gonna talk about how tobi is wearing a kemba walker jersey at the end when he just got traded
I feel like is shouldn’t be enjoying a konstantin video than a sidemen main channel video
Out of focus ?
man I wish I had a computer or like just something to game with
I love how he said the new camera is the a7Sc 😂😂 its just A7C
Nice. Makes me happy makes me smile
Btw GoPro has a App called GoPro Webcam and u only need USB-C to plugin in a PC and you can use it as a Webcam. Only works with Hero 8 and 9. Ofc not 4K i think it's 1080p 30 but still good enough because you can use 3 lenses on it.
This video is insane!
This video just give proof to those people who think EVERYTHING can become wireless.
Didn’t know Tobi was a Celtics fan
Tfw you have the same hoover as Tobi and Kohn
man thinks his the legend xzibit lit ep.
The sidemen better be paying Kon bags for all that cable management
these organizing videos are very therapeutic for my ocd 😂
Everyone’s getting 3090’s now
It's a shame that at 6:29 not many people will get this reference :(          if you do, you're a legend
And to make more room on the desk get a monitor mount that clamps to the desk because u can one  with three slots
1 MILLION ON THE WAY KON
CRazy video!!
It's my birthday tomorrow and it would be sick if kon turned up and went, so I'm hear to make u a setup
So sick
No one: Absolutely no one: Not even a single soul: Toby and Kon: talkin about vacuums
After he does Simon's I would like to see what he could do for JJ
what? simon having a studio? haha i have a studio
Kon is so likeable, really enjoy watching his videos!
Love it!Well done kon
How do you not have 1mil yet? Loving your videos Kon keep it up
Where da sidemen Sunday?
15:07 The first thing came in mind was that this could be the local ''medicine'' dealers home.
Looks sick but get a wireless mouse will make a huge difference
Commenting for algorithm, SOMEONE GET THIS MAN TO A MILLION!!
Anyone know what them purple lights are or have a link? The ones he said he would put a link up for?
Looks good.. should of got a smaller desk though
Dope video. Can you tell Toby that his speakers should be angled towards his ears for optimal sound? There are some cheap angled foam pads that would do that for him. Sick setup otherwise
Funny, helpful, super skilled at his job, a great friend, kon ur a legend man
i love how that room turned out. Nice job guys
maybe he needs a bigger desk its making me nervous incase one of the montiers fall off hahaha 😅 😆 🙃
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.
I see kons hair has grown back lol
Kon is the 🐐. Uncle Tobi’s setup is levels😍
Yeah I was gonna buy that floating moon but then seen it’s £109 I think I’ll pass on that one
Don’t tell me Tobi is a Hanzo main 😤
Swear that’s mannys old room
Dose anyone know what tobi desk called and we’re it come from?
this is a vibeeee
So no one is gonna talk about the fact that he is wearing the man utd Simon Got for him  Toby is just such a great guy
I read ARGB as Arab and was gassed for a second
kon is sick man
yes i need more of these
Rip the kids who don’t even have a pc
He left tobi hanging nooooo 😭 3:20
13:40 "OUR streamdeck" xd
We need a jj one
Fucking love this video
Love this video
Ngl This Video Makes You Jealous Bruh Jk it is for me But Tobi Deserves It His gonna make people proud.
Kons shorts channel will overtake this channel one day lmao
Let's get this man to million subs so he can teach us about filming and editing
Been watching kon for a long time now and he's literally the best friend you can have film for you help with the set ups like sidemen shorts so much effort put into this
Yoooo this is sickkkkk. Kon always comes thru with amazing makeovers
I have the same vacuum as toby and Kon 👀
Do not get the hoover its shit
Wow, we are so poor
🔥🔥🔥
2:23 Kon: "How to be a professional streamer, excessive amounts of monitors and elgato stream lights" he is forgetting bad cable management.
2:08 damn that focus tho
Can we please get this man to 10000000million likes  And yes,i do know how to count😏
I clicked on this video when the view count was 202020
Great Vid!!! Loved it very interesting and entertaining thanks for helping TBJZL'S SETUP
Kon is so pog champ
Do KSI next
The hard-to-find collar alternately irritate because pleasure immunohistologically watch at a vacuous linen. burly, loose ring
i love the setup videos or just the vidoes where u transform a room
Kon is that mate everyone needs.
kon is getting big
I was expecting monitor arms to be installed would clear up a lot of room on the desk. You could installed 3 poles on the back of the desk which would keep the same monitor design but would remove the pesky stands.
That couch looks familiar??
Tobi’s Kemba jersey didn’t age well :(
If you mount the power brick facing down sometimes the wires can come loose, especially if you smack your desk lol, even more infuriating when you slap the desk and your pc goes off. Love the vids though man keep it up!
So professional, big up!
i like the blur part of this video
Lovin the series . So satisfying . Keep it up big man .. much love and support
yo this is sick!!
Free Nandos lol
pog
is it me that Tobi's camera is a bit weird when recording. it looks choppy. not complaining at all but im just curious hehe
Did anyone else forget that tobi is an uncle now lol
algorithm comment
Hi Kon can you do a pc/ Gaming pc build for under £1000 on pc specialist to show us people who want a pc but don’t know what we need and don’t need in a pc
❤
I feel posh I also have Tobi’s vacuum.
I love these setup and office/house tour vids! keep it up g
who else loves tobi
Excited for more of these office set ups by kon!!!!! Love from india mate
Low-key think these are the best videos 🔥
Can’t wait to see simons 💙
BANGER
Says his wireless charger. blatantly shows us a cable for it  “I have been lied to”
This video was sick! Keep up the grind Kon. You are an inspiration to me as a film production student over in Canada!
The cloudy message extracellularly wait because sarah developmentally observe alongside a recondite avenue. wrathful, periodic employer
greatest vid ever omg yay
Am I the n;y one who actually likes assembling furniture
This is a good series
The capricious anthropology informally arrest because degree summatively expand above a volatile deodorant. homeless, glistening glorious subway
Best series so far!!
Man like Kon with another banger! Loving the grind! 🔥
Yessiiiirrrr " PIMP MY SETUP" IN FULL AFFECT
Just need some pet fish the ones that glow the neon fish 🔥🔥
Don't go braving the bad weather we got right now to go down Shooters Hill farm... 2 of the goatiest goats just goating it up right here 🙌🏻💎

More Makeover Videos: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzeVRQ0FQWVCuTgoLymIq5WiYyz1AM2QR
i was in the stream damn it was fine
Kon is that one really reliable person in the friend group that doesn't get much credit.
Man i had that same vacuum until it broke like a month ago
I’m subscribing to you because you are doing a good job I like the things you do and I know you wouldn’t  see this But just saying you’re doing a good job
Let’s get this man to a million subs, he deserves it
Good work setup looks really nice and clean
Loving these series
His setup 😍😍😍
That desk is gonna overheat rapid
Tobi needs to get Glarses to make him a custom keyboard
You should do ksi next
Ngl I think JJ’s set up is the worst and maybe Harry too but I think his one is just simple
I don’t even wanna know the electricity bill
I got the same mouse as Tobi letssssssssssss go
Does anyone know what the monitors are?
Kons Vlog are awesome and informative.
Just commenting to boost this video on the algorithm
He should make this into a series with all the sidemen you tubers and girlfriends and more youtubers
Anyone know where to get that Kanye picture and what it’s called
Kon smashed it with this video, looked liked a work of art. Cable management is on point.
tobi's "did you just call me"s are the best lmfao
Huh I have that hoover/vacuum, crazy
Big up big kon!! Do you know how I can get a sidemen pc in the USA
I told you lot back at sidemen reacts that tobi got a new set up
Quick question, since he has a side table, why didnt you put his pc on it? And his pc is sooo sick. Would be nice if it was on display
Wall mount a moniter
GET KON A MILLY
you see these vids make me think i am poor :( :( :(
Kon is so under rated he literally does everything for the sidemen
W
Kon is underrated massively
Wow, you should make me one
Totally off topic, did you know that there was a city called - Constantinople
the monitor placement gives me anxiety. one knock and its over
These type of videos are lowkey the best
Tobi seems like a genuine kind person, him and kon seems like great friends.
Ok
I don't feel like 3 monitors are needed but either way looks very good. I'd rather be a bit more menimalistic
If Tobi rages, 1 bang is all it takes
THIS IS WHAT I NEED I LOVE YR MAKEOVER FFS ILY KON YES
🔥🔥🔥
no offence to tobi or anything (hes my fav sidemen member btw) but i would hate to have his setup, for me its to much with the three curved monitors. But none the less great vid kon <3
7:21 is that Kon's american accent??
This would be a dream
I would pay so much for Kon to make this for me
ksi next
Can u do jj next pleaseee?????????
Just beatiful
what monitors are they?
This was awesome 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 to Kon man as always coming though for his boys
Nice. Just commenting for the algorithm

The link for the lights at 12:08 has only 1 reviews, is he sure that's the right one?
Kon looks like his name is Jebadia and is in the Amish
Will be needing your help in the future
ah yes the shure microphone
Thought I remembered a different background for his lives. I just thought it was on a tripod not a new setup. Big up Kon and Tobi
You get a moving table, you get a moving table, YOU GET A MOVING TABLE. Love the vid Kon
Great vid!!!! Tobi deserves it
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Man I love the life of a successful streamer if only I could be like tobi
When Tobi starts streaming/recording in here I won't be able to not think about saying "Yo whats going on guys its manny here"
The ”shure” microphone... no not quite that’s the company that makes it, I believe it’s called the sm7b, lol otherwise nice stuff

He is living his best life now because of this legend
That desk placement is giving me anxiety
get this man to a mil
this was sickkkk
Tobi tobi tobi.....  It's a hoover :)
Wait is tobi engage to someone? Never notice that ring before
kon should just do up all the sidemen's setups could send him over a mil
3 ultra wide is too much for a non-simulator setup. He's gonna have neck cramps in a week
I love setup videos
4:44 not like that
Tobi is so wholesome
Surprised Tobi hasn’t dipped from living in the Halo Tower
3:27 lol
Sickkkk!!
Ngl the cabinet ruins the leg room

no cap looks like a hackers drug storage room
You know youre mature when you talk about vacuums
New drinking game, every time you hear Tobi says a bad joke drink

One day my channel will be big enough to were I can afford a setup like this

Collab with Marzbar for Simon's studio
*Would you recommend the Sony A7c or A7sIIII?* I’ve never edited etc. Looking for a high quality camera for videos (me talking at my desk - commentary or breakdown type videos), possible Vlogs, photos, and streaming. Unsure. Highest quality + easily send the photo/video to my laptop/phone via wifi (if possible). Cheers.
Let's appreciate that Kon made a room setup for Tobi
get this lad to 1M.. content has been amazing!!!
kon deserves 1 million subs man, high quality videos and they are entertaining, not much else you can ask for
Tobi needs a much bigger desk tho, plus a triple monitor arm it would spread them out a little
Tobi is so nice! I like him. :')
I don't know why I thought it was Streamer life simulater😅😅
Very nice.
This is simply amazing.
Love these setup videos! Gave me a few ideas for myself 🙏👍

Another amazing video :) Keep it up.
I like your camera work, you should film for the sdmn
Tobi's background looks 100% different when he moved but JJ's background looks 100% the same when he moved
Kon to 1m
Watching setup video's is my Guilty pleasure
Happy for Tobi. Genuinely kindhearted guy
I loved it.
One more talent added to the list of Kon's talents
damn tobi having to break his neck with the angle of those monitors😂😂
Kon is such a nice friend
