Question excuse my ignorance but does this guys think they are the badass crew in what the world or ? There was another gang that thought that but was almost eliminated would have been labelled extinct species. old expression;  "come on over for a BBQ" "what are we smoking?" "just some Crips"
Sound like cyberpunk 2077 songs

That f Squirrel was right....
ich höre grad einen zufalls mix und bei diesem lied musste ich gucken von wem es ist, weil es einfach nur gut, ne, sehr gut, ich meine hört selbst. es ist "hypest hype" und "more than alot". It gives you "fire in your eyes" when you "embrace" the "streetlife".
1:05 1:09
I would never had heard this if it wasn't for El Estepario Siberiano's drum session to it. It is even better with his drumming but I have both songs on playlist and dont skip
The tune that defined DnB for the next 5 years or more I think, it's 2025 and Jungle has seen one of it's hardest revivals

Bass so hard it fucked up homies eye, damn.
Yes this song obviously sucks 🤣 However the hate in the comments section is hilarious, Wills has been a superstar for decades. Like he cares what all the haters think 🤔 Most of his music has its place, he can afford a song like this
I am a time traveler, and currently in 2125, and people still listen to this tune.
Absolute legends to be able to produce classics over 2 decades😎

Naughtiness ☘️😎👍😎👊☘️😎👍👌
This tune was specifically made for me and my boy … I put this on and the 2 year old boy is cutting shapes without thinking just instinct…. Has called me “Daddaoweee” since he could speak …. “No one baddadan Daddaowee”
Day 1 classic that's going to be a classic forever 👊
This track deserves all the praise
This song is so similar to Gunslinga by Pegboard Nerds

Flowdan on this track for 23 seconds and owns the whole song
Lyrics: Baddadan baddadan baddadan rapapampam youre welcome
0:00 *man going on about trying to find bud.
Does it not sound like they are chasing weed at the very start of the song???
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉👍👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nobody badder than we 🗣 🔥
As much as I love Flowdan as he is my favourite garage MC. The first drop with Trigga is the best. Trigga is my favourite Drum n Bass MC. A tune with both of these in, made by Chase and Status is like a 3some with Shakira and Bryce Dallas Howard. Can't believe I only heard this for the first time yesterday. What a line up and what a tune. Trigga all the way. Big ups to Flowdan though, best 2 in the business
The Brave browser is finally allowing me to comment on videos. So hiya.
one of my favs 🥰😝
I will say I have more guns here in Miami home than they have people in the video

When humans enter space stations cohabitated with different alien races, this is the song they play, as the doors slide open and they make first contact.

Was never a fan of DNB but because of this I just added an 8 bars with a wobble bass and a kick, snare, clap, hi hat and parts of my melody and vocal and it sounds shit hot! Oh and that is in a 200bpm uptempo track!

This day came when god gave me back the ability to pray a few days ago. This Song came out pretty much the Same day. Pray in true fashion instead of ritualistic, dead prayer. I am a catholic and grew up in the church and on the streets (between wolves and sheep. Like in your Song, HH 3).  ❤❤❤    Day 13 free from drugs and alcohol and starting/ending every day with God's guidance. The greatest Gift I ever received.

My son's (2yo) favorite song 😂
What language is that?
So I'm die hard dnb since 99, novice producer. Chase n Status were among the first that I heard coming up. All these years later, been in Tampa for about 16 17 years now around where I first heard dnb. Much love to Damian, Dara and Dave, those who know, know. But I went downtown to Tampa Riverwalk on the river where yachts and sht gives tours. I want to start at the first bridge coming in from the Bay, sit there in the dark wit the whole river lit up in lights, (yeah we sweet like that), let the intro build wit the echo under the bridge, wait for the drop and bump this drop and do a whole boat tour with a whole playlist selected for the skyscrapers to be like "WTF!!!"  Point is I've been dreaming about this for months and it all starts wit this track ....just story and a dream 🤘😆✊ 1

I gotta say this is a jam. But there's one line that is incorrect. Nobody badder than we? No.  Maybe in middle school.  But the US military says otherwise.😊 I belong to a gang that truly is .... Nobody badder than we.  Anything else is child's play. All gangs in America operate under the safety the US military provides.  🚸

Someone translated the lyrics 😂  "Worse than, worse than, worse than, Anywhere we observe them, we fire another shot at them. Retrieve my 45. Caliber and my Remington 12 Gauge, If any person speaks ill of me, I shall be forced to end their life. Men of ill character, our reputation cannot be tarnished, Our reputation cannot be tarnished and we would end the life of a live sound technician for entertainment. Large men of ill character from the United Kingdom of Great Britain When the baseline drops it will do so with such force that the very structure of the building may be compromised.  There is nobody worse than us There is nobody worse than us There is nobody worse than us There is nobody worse than us  Worse than, worse than, worse than I've been unpleasant since I was born Where do you get your unpleasantness from? Firearms I obtain could have come from Afghanistan The people don't want to see this ridiculous microphone that I have in my hand My poetry is so fierce it is akin to the discharge of a firearm Large men of ill character from the United Kingdom of Great Britain, When my poems spontaneous combust, watch the live sound technician flee the building  There is nobody worse than us There is nobody worse than us There is nobody worse than us There is nobody worse than us  Hello, travel whilst carrying a firearm  With regards to the people who speak ill of me, I will shoot at them They claim to be men of ill character, I will have to ask them which of them is When we shoot at people, we also throw grenades They are then dead and we proceed to walk over their bodies, like a giant fictional gorilla Our friends arrive and none of them speak to the police Balacalva on my face, automatic firearm in my hand We have no further time to waste with gun battles  Fire your gun, we are worse than"

There are not enough likes for me to show appreciation or love for this song. Thanks guys, this is a masterpiece so far <3
Best uzivc
As a music observer, I find a crisis in modern mainstream electro music,[of course there are some artists which are unique but in general I say...] anywhere you turn your head, there are this techno or tech house sounds with no difference from each other, but UK drum and bass is killing it right now, there was some downfall with them also in 2016-2020 but now UK is killing the sound! Good job.
it's about time we stopped glamorisingz and started shaming, those who use violence to get power and that sell poison to the communities and ruin the lives of families of addicts
Please come to South Africa, we really do love and appreciate all you do! Thank you for the amazing music.
proper
Video's a bit cringy, isn't it? Grown men thinking they're hard while holding finger guns.

Love British gangsters.  Small spaces.   More space than real.  They really try to do it.  You have some cool OG dudes.   Listen to them.  We have big streets homey..   big.   Everyone can get it so most have manners in their own neighborhood.    See ya when we see ya.  G
I m wondering if there is someone in the comments sayng this is jus noise:))).BECAUSE IT s nott very good
Saw them in live under the rain with all the people around me dancing and vibing to it. Just the way it should be. When the drop hit everyone went crazy and the rain in that moment seemed perfect. Amazing core memory.

I can't understand why I feel like I was listening to this track on pills in the noughties?
England do you understand what this song is about now? 🔥
Which type of remix
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I honestly don't get the mad hype on this tune I mean it's alright but it's nothing special just average there's actually much better tracks being produced if you dive deep into the dnb scene away from C+S, I'm not hating on them been a og fan since 2003 but they've made much better tracks than this
2:07 Nice one Lol 🔥
FAST OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolute monster of a dnb banger, with rappers just tearing baddadan verse, one after another.

This was fire, but I thought  it was going to hit a LOT harder at some point.
After hearing this I knew this would be perfect for introducing the people of my island to modern music. So I got it added to the playlist rotation at the radio station. Truly an epic rap!

I am a 21 year old music producer, been listening to dis✨✨✨✨
I'm a 98 year old retiree who used to listen to bangers like this back in my day, in fact earlier this afternoon I was having lunch and thinking back on those times... see back then you didn't have as many options for lunch but you could count on it, they'd be piping hot and delicious, even back then sometimes I'd just go without eating... see without having any kind of manual labor to do, a fella like me never got that beach body that the young ladies were after, we'd have to go down to the docks and do push ups and use some of the equipment down there.. It was dangerous, let me tell you what, I remember one afternoon, it was blazing hot, somehow I just remember it being muggier back then.  We didn't have air conditioning in the houses like we do now, we'd just have to sweat it out, the ladies all had a personalized fan, that was all the rage for awhile... there were a few years where Oriental fashion was very big in some of the circles... I never had time for that of course, what with the arithmetic and what not, a fella got awful busy in the evenings.  I didn't have the natural ease at schooling like my older brother Robin did, oh he was so smug!  Dad always compared us and usually it felt awful until Robin's senior prom.  I was just a junior see, but I had been practicing some moves with some of the pep squad gals... when it came time for Robin to make his big debut, after sneaking a silver dollar and a recently acquired record to the DJ... the pep ladies and I stole the show with a revolutionary dance routine, set to a contemporary number called "Baddadan".  Boyyyy, you should have seen my spiteful brother's face when I led the whole crowd, tippin' and leaning, teaching them our new dance, which we called the "Douglas"... after Douglas McNarly, who unfortunately was at home with the Mumps that evening.

Я как будто бы уже сто триллионов миллиардов лет проживаю на триллионах и триллионах таких же планет, как эта Земля, мне этот мир абсолютно понятен, и я здесь ищу только одного - покоя, умиротворения и вот этой гармонии, от слияния с бесконечно вечным, от созерцания великого фрактального подобия и от вот этого замечательного всеединства этого грува, бесконечно вечного, куда ни посмотри, хоть вглубь - бесконечно малое, хоть ввысь - бесконечное большое, понимаешь?

Something about an islander accent over a Drum N Bass beat that just hits different 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I activated the subtitles and somehow Youtube knows what the man is saying. Honestly just thought he made up his own words as the song went on.

Still addicted to this track. Deep deep voices. Does weird shit to me and I like it, a lot. ❤

12yo grandma here love to put this song up on my old marshall  rig while making rice
This song hits harder than a fucking gunshot absolutely amazing
Cringe.
I evolved from the primordial soup 4.5 billion years ago to hear this track.
Love this banger me and my lil boy rave to it 😊😂
I barely understand anything but the vibes are on point. :D
most known DnB I’ve ever heard
Sutton up
Love this song
hell naw its buddy from top boy
i like black people :)
😂i am😅
BADDADAN!
Came on in a club in Estonia. Only 3 of us knew it and we locked the gaff down. Fucking unreal scenes.
Im literally 300 years old, used to rave to jungle for a good 20years until it went all shit and fast like techno so l fucked it off about 15yrs back and moved to uk drill. Im 49 now and this got me feeling like l wanna attend a rave again. Obviously without the copious amounts of stimulants this time, that shit would kill me dead now. Lol Trigga would remember me from those days if he could see me. Trigga and Bassman were my favourite MC duo. This track is hard.
Love all the way from Kerala🤯☠️💓💓
1:00 best part
I’m from Mars! This shut is so pretty!!!!!!!
Sehr sehr geiler Beat 😎
I am the manifested concept of time itself flowing through the endless infinities of space and giving matter its direction, and I Baddadan to this all the me! Hard!
Now i can only hear the BANANA BANANA RAMADAN 😂❤
❤
This has to be the funniest comment  section I’ve read in ages and it’s a great song.  I’m a 44-year-old British Prime Minister, and when this comes on in the cabinet office, I look around the room at my colleagues thinking “are we, surely not”.   Then Kemi Badenoch taps me on the shoulder and tells me I’m missing the point.
🔥🔥🔥
On then7th day after he created me, God played this and the heavens rocked
FUCK ME! AND THEN SOME. MUSIC ORGASM ANYONE?
Imagine this sound in France ... within the election !!!

MAKE THEM THE MADDEST Nothing but the baddest Chase & Status Letter A on the ladder lift Bet B your gonna see Sound off an album In productivity Take em higher when we sauce sound Receptivity Down for action with that hipstep Activity Production of a program To make a jam no penalty And if you really like the ill sounds Be glad i got u, a bass emcee Reservation for a whole crowd now  be different Persuade me with no conformity Rap to move above and beyond tragedy Clown me say my style is raggedy Until my mics turned on  Society hurrying tries to bury me And i ain't done nothing wrong

REAL BADMAN FROM OUTTA ENGLAND.
Blud, I think this is the song Einstein wrote the bible to.
Dancing in the dark…
Nice music, why does IT need this para-military context?
My favorite thing about this video: They're just all THERE.  Even in shots showing someone else rapping, all of the other features are in the background, going off to the beat.  In a time, where random features are in every song, but you can see clearly that their shit was filmed somewhere else and they probably didn't meet once, it's special
bad bomboclatttttttt ttunnneee
I'm 10 but this song can be in my life till I'm 50 something cause its a BANGERRRRRR 🎉🎉🎉🎉 🤩🤩🎆🎆

I come from a different time, choose from which time, the tune bangs at any time.
There seems like a confused bunch are looking at this song and wondering about it. Understand why it was made in the first place. Clue: it has to do with making a statement bitch.
Damn vibe

My auntie and cousins and brother know this song my first cousin is 11 years old. His name is Stan. And my other cousins is 15 years old and his name is Rado. My cousins know this song when they were both.were seven years old, I am 8 years old

I thougt strategy from Manchester was in this guy sounds exactly like him.. I'm not sure who copied who tho :/
So sad, it's amazing until the drop and then it slows down and becomes hella boring... Jump up d'n'b is such garbage... Would have been 50 times better with a liquid beat instead of this slow ass BS. Good try tho, good try.
The song
Who come after D block & s te fan remix?  👇

Used to love this song but some one tooth crack head killed it for me on YouTube shorts mining it 😂😂
As a 55 yo I love everything from Madonna to the Kinks. I fell in love with electro and hip hop at age 14 in 1984 but this blows my mind... f ing brilliant!
Never has it felt so good to have bleeding ears!
ouch, i love that bit at 2.59, gosh you got my veins flowing, thank you
that beat is absolutely filthy  downright offensive, just rude
What a tune
I'm old school electro and hip hop (Soulsonic, COD, Jonzun Cew) but this blows my mind as a 55 yo! Love it, such talent!!!!!
this song saved me 🤲🤲🤲🤲
Finally something revolutionary
The boiler room lead me here

I’m an internationally renowned MC named BassMan, and when I put this banger on I lose my absolute shit and totally forget the fact that that fucker Trigga left me high and dry and sold me out. We were a duo that done everything together, now he’s fucked me right off at the first sniff of mainstream exposure. Taught that kid everything he knows. Still, I’m gonna turn the volume up on this one, blow out all the window pains, and whip the pipe out to ease the pain. 🔥 🔥 🔥
I'm a 420 year old journalist from the future and this track is so fire that in managed to burn CO2. Chase and Status got the peace nobelprize AND the chemistry nobelprize, because it's the only thing in the world that can burn CO2
Good song. But they are so cringe  :D "Gangsters"
I have this on a playlist called 100mph because that's how fast I want to mob in my vehicle every time I hear this track.

What do you even call this ?
Very coool moch more music! 😮❤
I'm a 10,000 year old labrador. When this comes on I sh*t on every single carpet. Let's gooooooo
Unpopular opinion and many will come at me, this isn't even in the top 4 tunes of the album it's on. It's catchy, that's why people like it so much. The first genuine D'n'B "pop song" I can think of. No hate. I love c&s, pull gun fingers when this drops and sing along like the rest. But as an actual D'n'B tune, it's light.
Love this track. ElE stepario Siberiano's drums should have been on the original. It makes the song even more epic than it is.

Just a normal Saturday in Brixton
i like the drum&bass base , the vocals meh....
22 Million views - nuff said! 👍
Tyson fury vs ngannou
NO OFFENCE TO ANYONE....but this really drops at 1.48...facts
Boring tune. Typical over used jump up bassline.  Encouraging Negative jamaican thug culture as if there isnt enough violent crime in the inner cities in the uk. Just total garbage.
This is a shameful ripoff of Jamaican culture.
Absolute banger 😍
I've already given orders for this and queen  another one bites the dust, original nutter and other bassy tunes at my funeral,,, lots of bass so I can hear them partying with the ground vibrating one last time for me

What is the meaning of this artwork?
This sh8t is hard AF
This could turn Hare Krishna into a bad bwoy! FCK YEA!
Luke. I am your father.
Estepario's drum cover of this track is fucking mad.
This is that ill 1997 outlaw party in a Brooklyn warehouse on 6 e's type jungle.
I was dying 99YO on my deathbed. This came on and then I started dancing, my body released so many endorphins, that I started agiing in reverse. I have just aged all the way back to being a foetus.
I'm a 6 month old song that evolved sentience and the ability to comment on itself.
El Estepario Siberiano’s live drum cover sent me here 👍
Its Chase & Status, what can go wrong? amazing track, Remember the live set you did where you opened with this, just to rewind it right after drop to build it up again.
I'm listening to this and I'm not even born yet
Sick af

Without El Estepario Siberiano's drums, this track is still good but seems so bland to me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiqvfSa8z6M&t=244s

I am a 600 year old woman with a third leg with which I used to type this comment when this song came on.

Top tune, first heard it in Bou’s set on DnB Allstars 360🔥🔥🔥
I'm here from El Estepario's channel
I wasn't born yet, but I can already hear it.
Big bad man from outer England
In this video Chase & Status look like two commercial landlords who heard about a squat party happening at one of their properties, went down to investigate and then decided the best thing to do was to try and 'blend in'.
(Alfie)))123🫡😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤬
Also, while I'm at it. Chase and Status is a movement.....it's not just about the music, it's about the message. We are not labels we are people...human beings. X
No one badder than WE. WORK TOGETHER, NEVER AGAINST X
It's coming... TRUST
0:45 le mama mouiiiiiii!
Long live the groove father 🙏
I'm an old stool junglist that hates Chase & Status.

Turn of static close your eyes i give you vision older than the Sun and more precious than the greedy deception of sodom and gomorrah  if you believe  in family then you are on side of history that has no need for trinkets confusion false claim of righteous genocide it has chosen for blind to die for ... my friend  is the one no words need exchanging  and truth no matter the outcome will be only future
I'm God. I was going to destroy human race but then I've listen this epic song and can't stop dancing. You have showed me what you got.
We are now moving forward .. its going down and i say no adult has wisdom of anyworth compared to our Bosses silence if you are aware of true leaders then now is here no compromise i will never  comply to the lie

how has flowdan become so relevant recently? His brand is so strong that it's hard to deny his verses and flow hit harder than most at the moment. But how has he been hidden for so long and only surfaces now?
It's just a band WOW 🎉🎉🎉
I'm the revived crusader from the 13th century and I jam to this harder than Baldwin II jammed with Baphomet.
Please. Name or nick of man in ski mask? 😍

just realised that flowdan is playing at a festival im going to tomorrow and i didnt realise as this song has been in my playlist the past couple of months 😅
These fellas have been dropping fire for over 20 years and continuing to break ground in ways never seen before in the DnB scene. Sure people have their opinions on it being “commercial” or “overplayed” but I for one love every single banger.   Never has the scene had someone not only as influential as Chase & Status but as consistent as them at turning out music that sounds as good from the first play up till the 100th time of playing it.  Long live Chase & Status. ❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm a 5000 year old deity of carpentry and this got the boys in the shop slamming

If you press key "3" on your keyboard, it gets the song exactly on the Badadan part!
Yessss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
anthem  🔥
My man MC Trigga reppin North
BADADAN, WHERE YOU GOT YOUR BUTTER FROM§
The beat is awesome as always BUT the lyrics are THREAT FOR THE SOCIETY. This shows more of the violent face of the migrants. And actually provokes more of it. Do not be surprised when dumb kids with no education and of migrant roots listen to this track and get motivated to shoot us, stab, steal, pillage and rape our daughters. Music is not just a reflection of the reality. Music is also a catalyst! Be warned!
does bou have downs hahaha its like theyve brought out Harvey price to do a neck slice for no reason
TRIGGA WILL YOU TAKE ME SHOPPING??
Five nights at freddys was shit
I went so mental when Trigga came on I volleyed me nan!  She drop kicked me back, all square in this house
The best song to stimulate adrenaline
Le he puesto este tema a mi abuela de 103 años y se ha puesto a bailar breakdance con la manta eléctrica

I am Alarion the Eternal, a millennium-old wizard from Eldoria. Gifted with an innate connection to magic, I mastered the arcane arts at the renowned Arcane Academy. My staff, crafted from the heartwood of the World Tree, symbolizes my mastery over the universe's forces.  Retreating to the Astral Citadel, I evolved into a being of pure arcane energy. In times of darkness, my voice guides chosen champions with prophecies and empowers them with ancient spells.  For a thousand years, I've stood as a beacon of wisdom and magic in Eldoria's ever-changing tapestry. I am Alarion, the Eternal and I can not stop dancing to this at work.
I want more music like this SOUNDS EPIC 💯❤️‍🔥💖❤️‍🔥💯🎶🎶🎶

Chase & Status is the reason our agency’s light bill is so high… the firm now runs Rudebwoy Bidnizz 24/7  ‘93 til Infinity
🇬🇧 mix
I'm a 300,000 year old Australopithecus with one leg eaten off by sabre-toothed tigers, a fear of fire and lightning, and even I brock out when this rude boy drops. Absolute mammoth-killing soundtrack, I predict big things for Chase & Status in 250,000 years when humanity evolves.

I'm an ancient being that dragged itself from the primordial ooze eons ago, and I played this for mis compas at the local taqueria and they dropped dead of heart attacks.
This song hits harder than my dad's belt
This is just fireeeee 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🧯🧯🧯
I saw apashe do this live... was he involved in production or just rocking it live?
All I can say is 🕷 barbed wire in corner. Hysteria days are nearly back
Dont know why people like it so much. nothing special and lame. the stuff from concord dawn is a lot better for me.
The boyz are back with a banger !!!!
Nah, can't touch the 90s
💛🎧💭
I’m a 2023 year old carpenter and this tune makes me feel like I’m walking on water. My dad’s not a fan though, he prefers that old gospel rubbish
BADDA BADDA!!
My license is gone coz of this song i was going a 50 on a 20 opps play this song at max
Sfx balaclava is better
Dang this brings me back to the good old times!!
I love this song ❤
I'm a 120 year old nan and when this comes on in the caf I   spin around and throw bubble & squeak at everyone there. Can't get enough I just love the way music evolves...been a fan since the Vera Lynn days
🤙
😍🤩🤩🤩🤯
This is such a good song
BOAAH! 🎉❤
it’s the guy from top boy
BALACLAVA PON FACE, MATIC INNA HAND
hardest song i've ever heard in my entire life. A once in a life time song.
Oooooooooooo🔥🔥 bumbaaaa
Im not the biggest DnB fan I mostly listen to house music, disco, or techno but I think this is probably the best song and best produced song I've heard in the last 5 years. Absolute banger 🔥
Это пиздец😅
I never really comment as you can see how many times ive commented on this channel, but fuck me what a tune.. Chase and status never disappoints after all these years. Gotta big them up.
You know when you pull that face when you've tasted something disgusting, that's what I done when I heard the beat drop. 🤮Sick
Yo my NIGGAS!!  Real talk!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥⛅️🔥🔥⚡️⚡️
This song goes so hard!!!!!!
Tinie Tempah vibes? Reminds me of him.
Аху...нно, пацани, повторіть!!!!
Still sounds as hard as I remember 3 years later ! Ocean Gang !
My boss: lose that attitude or go home. Me: 1:06
This is my best song I know ; so as liqor and cigarettes
cheer mate nan now knee sliding across the house after listening this banger🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeah boy
i am 123 and danced in my coffin like crazy to this
beautiful sky (no joke). :D with that "clair obscur" :D
I’m sorry 49 from hackney, been listening since the start of jungle/DandB and I don’t get the big attraction with chase and status, mostly mediocre stuff over the years, they’ve done a few bangers here and there, but there’s nothing on this new ting that gets me going, they ain’t no pendulum. Also how come man’s like shy FX and potential Badboy who’s been making constant bangers from the beginning don’t get a big up like these 2
This tune is a british music resurgence
IT FUCKING NEEDS TO BE IΝ THE NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUΝD 3!!!
When trigga drops everyone getting shot
TBH you pistol Pete' s need a story on old skool moss side. You have no idea. Song is amazing btw and the boiler room set was so on the mark
FLOWDAN IS A FORCE OF NATURE👌🫡🇬🇧
THIS FUCKIN SHIT A FUCKING BANGER
Holly shit

Thank you for reintroducing dnb back into my life. It’s been a while.. but damn.. will be waiting for you in Belgium.
HELP ME, PLEASE 🙏 😢 I would like to purchase your music in record form but it's all SOLD OUT 😢  HELP ME
Hard ❤️🙏🏻
Спасибо Залипухе,что я узнала об этом треке😊
Giving me Katy on a mission vibes
This song has been stuck in my head since the day it was released, excellent work to all involved!   And who says England doesn't have culture....this is Camden town in a song and a video!  Koven also played it couple of weeks back in her South African Set!!   Much Love from South AFrica!
A good collaboration and overall a good song but it is obvious the artists who have preformed the vocals have had too much of an input in the visuals. I remember when the music video told a story as-well as the music.
Bruv, dats a fucking BOP right chyeah
his voice makes a hella agreesive combo
Tune is awesome and deserves all the hype it’s getting, but -3 lufs  loudness, lol really? I know loudness wars in dnb are something else but this is just monstrosity. So uneccesary, squashed to death, lifeless and distorted… and in time when  Youtube and other streaming services decided to end loudness wars and normalise audio to -14/-16 lufs.  And them being probably the most prominent names in dnb are just making it worse by forcing kids to be “as loud” as them, with their music ending up as a big pile of over distorted garbage because they don’t have the skills to make it sound at least listenable.   So unedessary, the tune would be the same hit if it was produced and mastered normally, but would knock and punch even more…
First time I heard this was the Fury Nagganou face off and being looking for it since.. Found it !!! Pure Fire!!!
This is boss in every sense of the word
Booom
youtube sucks
This song just pleases everyone. Drum n bass but that touch of jamo got us lit over here too
These man actually look baddadan like 😭😭😭😭
What a banger!!!!
What is this sorcery? Im a 47 year old fart and my dances moves closely resemble a grand mal seizure but I cant stop myself flailing around wildly to this😂
Extreme banger. I'm subconsciously nodding my head listening to this.
What a tune 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Phuckin ape shite madness. Absolute slammer 🔥🔥🔥
I thort this song was a piss take is it a actual song 😂😂😂😂 bad tune this the serious face on the fella hahahahaha sounds like a shit 90s tune

I wake up in the mornings with this tune in my head. Probably my favorite this year. I love to see so many people work together to create a lively and iconic piece of art. We’ll all look back in 10 years and still talk about this gem! Congrats to all the artists and thank you for your incredible contribution to our music
Os amo🛸🎼💙
Arguably Paul McCartney's best work 🔥

My 3 year old daughter likes this song more than baby shark. If you're a parent anywhere in the world this is a big deal! 🤝🏼 Chase & status! 👏🏼

DnB track of the century so far,keep up the good work boys
Walk with the rappa pa Pam cos I'm 42 and don't give a damn 💪😎💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Flowdan the grime legend !!!!
This is so British 😂
A lot of stuff coming out of UK is utter crap. I flipped through the radio the other day and caught this and heard matey with the deep voice, I thought "that's different" then heard the track. I'm a jazzer, but like old hiphop as well, obviously poking around in that leads you to stuff like Eazy-E and the west coast gangsta stuff. What they were trying to do, demonstrating their "bad man" culture got blown out of the water by this. US produces some good music and they're solid performers, but the UK, when it whacks, it whacks properly. 10/10.
Who’s the guy rapping the first drop (1:07)? He’s so cool
Hare Krishner is still a bad bwoy 💙

Ok so if i was building a set to play in a club... and my homies are also building sets.... is there a limit on how many times we can get away with playing this track?? Or do we need to discuss who gets to play it over rock, paper, and scissors?
I'm Brazilian, I would like to see all the lyrics of the song, someone help me, this song is very good

OMFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
This jungle vibe brings me straight back to 2009-2011❤
I still CANT BELIEVE how my car still intact. Yesterday this song came on and I almost crashed. I was speeding trying to go on green light but the red one came and the cars infront of me stoped. I was going to hit the car infront of me and in the last moment I changed to the right lane forcing the car there to change to the other right line. Then the car from there came upfront me and stopped. From there  one big and fat man with a baseball bat came on heading to me. The song was still banging and I told him: "Look bro, it is my fault for this incident, BADADAN came on and I though that I am invincible, sorry". He nodded his head and said: "I understand, be careful next time!" then we shook hands and he got back in his car. I was still shaking and thank god I am alive. Thank you Chase & Status for this amazing song,  next time, I'll really be careful!
I really love this song. I listen this song at work,in my kitchen and my fitness room. Its really fenomenal🎉🎉🎉 Go Chase and Status
Found this by typing badabadabda

I don’t even know how many times I’ve listened to this in the past 48 hours! I’ve got a bit old and boring so don’t do much raving these days but this got me majorly reminiscing of the old days!

Boomtown made me hate this song 😂
Lol, this is proper on the down low 😂😂😂
As an old raver, trance Queen & massive Bass head it has to be said that C & S are among the best music outfit we have ever produced. UK has always led the way with jungle & DnB but these guys get better and better with each passing year. They understand DARK ❤
🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍
This has to be one of the sickest drops in fucking YEARS!
I can’t turn this off. I literally get goosebumps when it starts. I wish it was longer. CHASE AND STATUS WITH THEIR YELLOW CD WILM FOREVER BE IN MY VEINS. 😂🥰

Ive been sleeing on them for a while. hadnt listened for a few years.. and somehow in the back of my mind, a voice in my head was like `remember chase and status?`.. i type it in and its like 10..9..8.. to the release of this banger!!! Made me question reality. Its been YEARS and i type it in in the right SECOND
Cuz we have sound system at home it goes to 100 to 0 😱

I sit with two other people in an office. It takes all my might to just keep it to a mild headbang when playing this. Thank Jesus for noise cancelling headphones.
Such a pity I'm too old to go dancing anymore. This would have gone down well in Bedroom in Wolverhampton a couple of decades ago.

BE$T BANGA IVE HEARD ALL YEAR!! 💣💥💥🔥👊😎
Probably one of the better tunes I've heard in the past 1/2 hour - UK Top Ten Singles - but I'd love to know why the guy in the video is wearing - what I'd call a full open face balaclava - is it meant to make him appear sinister? Is he paranoid about facial recognision when passing CCTV whilst out and about, or -and I'm sorry if anyone finds this offensive - has he got ears that embarass him?
🔥 Tuuuune 🔥
I'm a trance music producer but love cool DnB like Baddadan :)
New addiction song found ✌️
Big man tune ya get me

Trigga cold 🥶
Legend
Even my old arse would go absolutely bonkers if this came onin a club. Its a masterpiece..
Very good positive lyrics that should create a nice warm vibe in any rave.  The “Matic” in hand line and gun chat and talk of killing and maiming particularly caught  my imagination.  Machete wielding thugs at Notting hill carnival  should particularly enjoy this kind of vibe 🤪
Bangers and mush , boom 💥
this a tune tune, Been waiting for release 💯💯❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
I’m gonna lose my license if this keeps coming on in the work van 🔥🔥
Thought that was Harvey price for a minute at 2:57 🤣

Saw them at Creamfields and when this dropped I didn't need no drugs. That energy was crazy. The build up. The drop. Sh*t the bed.  See you in Leeds in September for round two. Keep your eye out for the fluorescent Skeleton hands. That'll be me skankin'👆👆👆
on fiyaaaaa madafakaaaa
Bruh HOW C&S managed to stay relevant for more than 15 years when almost all the other artists have retired or fallen off?! Truly G.o.A.t.s
Gutted how Chase and Status getting involved promoting guns, you guys make such good music, why have blokes in balaclavas making gun hand signals??!! Don't you know kids are dying on the streets?? For the love of music why promote murder 😢
mano.. que porrad40...
Certified banger! Will take some time for someone to come around and top this!🚀🚀🚀
Getting back home on a bicycle from my work place takes exactly 7 and a half Baddadans. And that's only because everytime Trigga started his verse I automatically jumped into hyperspace and moved through the streers like a fucking torpedo. Sheeeesh this is THE track.
Its just sounds more than perfect 🤔
This tune is dangerous for your driving licence...
This song is so fucking disgusting that everyone involved needs to be imprisoned for Human Right's violations.
tune of the year nuff said

Absolutely love C&S & flowdan, but honestly, I do not understand the hype over this tune… it’s mediocre at best, the drop is such an anticlimax.

You know why this is a banger? Because they’re not newbies on the block. Old school c&s with some seasoned older lads. That’s why it works 💪🏻 😎

Best tune ❤
Two up then the down then the lyrics banger banger banger love this so next door through a brick through my window just to hear it louder haha
Takes me back to to westfest 2011 💯🔥
This shit gets me going first thing in the morning!
All the comments about Flowdan and Trigga. Standout for me is Irah. Hes been working at music with little recognition for 20+ years. I remember his first solo releases back in the days when we were playing COD on xbox every single night 😂 BANG clan, always the General! So happy to see him featuring on some big tracks now.
This is way better than the stupid autotuned talentless fools with “lil” in their names. Those rappers need to bury their music and go away.
Well this is legit amazing. Chills down the spine anyone ? Absolute banger.
this song is for forever... masterpeace
Yo mad to see trigger my g from way back. Original mc trigger from a Manchesta.
🥶🥶🇬🇧
Flowdan deserved his flowers years ago, good to see him step pin something as mad as this tune!! 😤👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Video is trash, as a Lithuanian... U point trigger at me?... Meet the fakin brick, bithz... But the track is awesome, so much love for DnB.... Born to drum die for Bass
Son de oufff 🎉🎉
AMAZING
TRIGGA kill it  !
Nobody run out of weed!
Love this!!❤❤
Legendary lineup 💪
seen them yesterday at sundown chase and status are legends in the game just the best so good to see them live and to bring them all out of stage was so good so much better live
I love how the energy of the song matches the video, rare to see nowadays.
Gold Standard ✨
Ngl seeing trigga come from DnB as a yute to now being on shows like topboy, and featuring in songs like this, is maud.   big ups to you g
Nobody baddadan weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 🔥
Love the old skool feelz
What an artist. Britain really does produce some amazing talent. Big Shout from the US. Loving Chase and Status and also other various UK based electronic acts like The Prodigy, Chemical Brothers, Goldie, Underworld, Sqaurepusher, Faithless, Burial, Autechre,  Massive Attack, Stereo MCs, Orbital, Four Tet, Unkle, The Streets, The Bug, AllFlaws
I usualy was able to run like 4 km .... thanks to this song I ran my first 10km... literally blasting this on my earphones for 1h ... true story
Love this music but can’t play it in car as I start jamming and then my speed goes from like 30 to 120 lol 🤣

The gun fingers always crack me up...probably best to stick to the old skool Hardcore vibe, stay away from the gun fingers and leave the firearms to the big boys...
Y'all's vocals....😍😍
Had this on repeat all day 💯🎶🔥🔥🔥 got it stuck in my dome 😎😎😎😎🤣
Кайфую від цього треку, постійно на репіті🔥🔥 вітання з України🇺🇦
if you guys exploring the drumm and bass scene a lot of the best tunes were played live at events in the 90's will be hard to find but is the best music , trigga is the guy with the eye missing from manchester uk , usually tours with mc spyder and mc trigga was a good duo on a few tracks .
Such a sick production
This is not english
🔥🔥🔥
Pure fire..DNB 4 life
Is this the guy of top boy
Chase & Status back with a vengeance! Haven’t been feeling their sound for a while but this is an absolute banger. The track’s too short though, leaves me wanted to have it in permanent-reload!
Senks from Ukraine 😊

Waiting for the remix already 😅
If this was more dnb and less dub id nut
Big up from Ukraine. This of the best DnB tune in 2023. But form me personally it's one the GOATs. Can't be other way with Elite Badmans like Chase & Status, Bou, IRAH, Flowdan, Trigga, Takura.
Carnival BANGER!!
for me The Prodigy is #1 of all the time, but Chase & Status are really ones who do not let the flame go out . true fokin kings!
what a banger
Tune
🤞
Track of the year!
Songs like this are good for 1 play then super annoying after that
Tune
Flowdan came in so hard
As predicted, this was THE hype tune of every festival this summer. Rinsed at Boomtown, even Big Feastival which is a family friendly festival 😂😂😂
One of the best music i heard and god knows how much times i spend to listen music
cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooold
Sweet
Mix EDM with Dancehall ?! EDMALL
Takura "Shona Prince" or ndini ndarasika?
Pure 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn bro this lit 🔥
Arm hair is up and my neck is crawling. Absolute banger. Rushing to this haaaaard
Kurde, ale to jest dobre! Greetings from Poland!

BANGER OMFG !!! GG MATES !
🔥🔥🔥💪 saludos desde 🇲🇽 México
Chase & Status was always the best 👌
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Flowdan, sick! been to many grime raves when he's brought the roof down! 🔥
Reminds me of the belter old days by C&S
my fav part is where trigga come in...fyahhh
I miss the old chase and status, no vocals just samples.. trapdoor 😢😢😢
Smashed it would have good to see trigga a bit longer on the mic
These guys know how to make a banger, videos always slick af👌
Im a chilean guy who loves this style of music and I said this a glorious drum n bass... I love this so much bc this reminds me when the genre was in his peak. Chase & Status always killing it in their production and Bou putting his incredibly talent on this and the vocalists killing the bars IRAH, Flowdan, Trigga & Takura show me the flow and the culture in a level unreachable. Uk shows us the talent and the talent of them. Welcome to the new era.
😬
Idk what you guys are saying, but everything is so hype. I love it
from spain, wae love you guys
someone give me some songs that sound like this. I love the chorus!

Press 1, 3, 5 , or 8 for every "Baddadan"
This one’s a killer, jump up ya bwad man
1:09 ..... Lettttt offfff. Bang bang tune. That tune just needs alittle bit more of the 1:09 beat drop, coz thats sharp, deep, and mustard on the top of range speakers.
This sounds should be anthem of my country 🇱🇻
Rap meets breakcore/breakbeats? Next level sound.
Drum & Bass at its finest
1:06 who is that guy with the mad eye?

Tell them.       All.      The dress.     The cigar.        Fun shit.     Till.    I end everything. Related
Tell Hilary I found her missing ‘le’.      They were expecting.  Us.
Pas des deux.         How.    Fun.       Lol😂

This is deffo the UK's answer to that 90's east new York, grimey Hip Hop... This is the sound of the UK... BADDDAAADAN🔥
Top tune  👌
LOL
Bomb 💣💥
This track makes me want to drop kick the moth flying around my bedroom light 😂😂
Is this in English ? WTF is a baddadan, is that Ebonics for something?

This is fire💯🔥🎤🔥
drum bass + reggae <3
this shit is hard asf
Pure Banger! 🔥
❤🔥
😂🤣🤫
This is pure fire ... let go !!! Make this track Baddadan !!!!
Flowdans voice is ace
If you would have let all those low frequency in their voices, this would be a masterpiece. But you chose to cut them out because you needed to show your skill in producing basslines.
Okay, I might need a doctor, my heart is racing from all these BPMs!
whos this at 2:56
fire
BADDADAN BADDADAN BADDADAN! 🎉
fvckin' naughty \o/
nobody badda dan mi madda
Nobody baddadan this lot
Who's first ? With that deep voice
Дуже круто🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 benger
Why FX mixing Balaclava on top of this at Bassfest was insane
Man, Flowdan has been KILLING it lately. First Badders, now this? Props to the man.
I like this song it’s really good and catchy I could listen to it all day
😊😅dnbmakesmesohappy
.
Imposible GREAT! 🔥🎶🔥

Tremendo temazo!!!! ❤
Nobody badda than we
THIS SONG IS WAY TOO GOOD AND I CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW GOOD IT IS.
The same people that made take me away and hurt you. 😂
Sorry, I have to press the dislike button and go back and listen to 'Chase & Status feat. Takura "No Problem" '. That was groovy, funky and full of energy. I cannot hear any kind of energy here. Just some small foghorns. In my opinion foghorns ruined dnb. Just my 2 cents, cheers.
Deffo banning this tune out in car on way to work 🙌 👌
😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
Chase and status always blow me away with something no one else delivers or ever will
Ayo This is Pure🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤‍🔥

I was there at the birth of Jungle, drum and bass, and EDM (I'm old lol). Chase and Status without doubt are masters of their craft. Pure fire 🔥
This is nothing short of absolute FIRE 🔥🔥🔥

Baadddmaaannn thinggg
Nooobodybaadeewbaaaaddahdanweeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Been years since I went to see trigga sick mc
exceptionally polite roller :C
50% of the views are from me, I swear.  Masterpiece!
This video is sick
could have played it more often at LIR :D-
Chase & Status stay timeless forever!
Would love to see you link up with Omo Frenchie! Guys a vibe!!!
Summers Track. Fucking Slamming.
Djeeeeeezes, i came here a decade ago from 'take me away' what a journey these guys have done !
ONE OF THE BEST TUNES THIS YEAR 🔥🎶🎵
No right going this hard
shock they've done it again
👍💘💪
Solid tune!
What a banger man
This tune is an instant classic 🙏
Sounds like Boomtown.
Bad ass
One for the ages. Masterpiece
It haven't been released yet but i'm already sick from it when every dj at let it roll played it 💀
THEIVERY CORP ON ACID🔥❤️😎❤️🔥
Wicked 🎉🇨🇦
Didn't expect this to be a DNB track, Judging by the thumbnail, i thought it was gonna be hip hop.
I LOVE COCAINE PFK ZBR!
Biggest
I hate 90% of modern UK music but Chase & Status always releases bangers from time to time.
Al fin salió
irah is a real legend
Thanks guys, baddadan 👍🏼❤️
This is 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
What a classy.... tight and accomplished tune.... 2 cats at the top of their game.... i wish that we hear them more regularly.... class act! 🎉
Bad from mi bornnnnnn !
Sick tune!
I listened this first time baked , the best choice of my life. Absolutely banger 🇩🇪
Never miss tbh 🥰
Never disappoint Chase and Status, another banging tune❤
Biiiig tune
🙌🔥🔥🔥🔥
incredible
This is pure filth and it’s actually so naughty that’s it’s  unfair that we have been gifted this absolute banger
This one will still make the crowd go feral 18 years from now, mark my words. Successor to Original Nuttah I'm sure
When it comes to drum n bass no one can touch chase n status , everyone else is just playing at it!
Legendary
Chase & Status.. This is a master piece.. Mixing and mastering, its nexst level..
Dobry hałas!
🎉
Damn this is champions league of a collab
i drive to gym to baddadan, i workout to baddadan i chill to baddadan, i can't stop fucking listening to it.
Flowdan🎉
Best track ❤❤❤❤❤
holy my
🔥🎵🔥🔥🔥
Glad you brought this tune out. It’s fucking massive 🤘🏻
ZAAAAAAA JEEEEEEEEEE BISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS TEEEEEEEEEEEEE !!!
Yes bou ❤❤❤🔊🔊🔊🔊💯🔥🔥🔥
This was the best live at Brighton beach!!!
Chase and status bringing that energy obviously
Chase and status the only people that have been consistently putting out banger after banger since day 1
OmG Masterpiece 🔥❤️‍🔥🔥so Good
This video is mad, mad props to the videographer
should have got Idris too :D
Chase and status are on a whole nother level, by far my favourite artists on this planet and an absolute service to drum and bass! They’ve blew DnB up more than anyone else, the fucking Godfathers. On top of that the videos are always top drawer, inspired me massively to create videos like this too. What a time to be alive when chase and status are in their prime and have been for over a decade!!!
Added to party playlist
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Okay this sounds dope, so excuse my question, im totally new to this genre (I hear mostly Splatter Rap and Horrorcore) is this a remix from the first music video? it sounds a little bit different (and better) but i am a little bit confused 😅
filthy  sound engineering !!!
Woww
Chase and status are next level, no more idols was huge now this the beginning of the next big album can’t wait what else is to come
Так ну что кто нашел трек из тиктока Залипухи?😂😂😂😂
EPIC CONCHETUMARE
I see this as a great track for the right type of movie.
2:56 where tf was Bou looking ? 😂
baddadan weeee.... love it
🔥🔥🔥
Who wants to film a movie like?
I’m in that video lol😭
Please more like this ❤❤🎉
🎉💯👀🖤🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Brilliant
Heard this a solid 50 times at boomtown and it slapped every time 🔥
4x4 bootleg is better lmao
I  am hypnotised by this. Excellent work
Rinsed n over played. Getting boring now
So happy trigga was involved, big up guys a legend
Україна тут🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Too cold 🥶 🚀

Flowdan has had a hella productive year! Sick af 🔥
Reminds me of FIFA street 2’s grime sound
Holy shit, this is literrally incredible dopest shit, your album rtrn 2 jngle and all collaboration with artist from Jamaica so cool
Can't wait to hear this live, or even some mad man remixing this to a new level

This slapped so hard at Boomtown 🔥🔥
BADDADAN BADDADAN BADDADAN!!!
1:06 Trigga walkout is 🥵
This has to be on the soundtrack to the final season of Top Boy
Give Flowdan more mainstream attention.
🔥🔥
Already history! Has been mixed in so many ways this summer, which is amazing! But at the end I am most happy for Bou that he made it to collab with such legends!
I still dont get it, why is this song so overhyped.
Ok... I may have listened to this track too many times lol.i have whiplash lol
chase & status will always be with me
One of the biggest tracks to date
The only thing that pisses me off about this track is that it ends lol
I am never disappointed by Chase and Status . This is fucking incredible
🔥🔥 🇬🇧 🔥🔥
Flowdan fans eating good this year 🔥🔥🔥
Vocals and beat be hitting real different.
I hope there is gonna be a longer version cuz 3:00 is way too short
Yesss trigga, Bassman should of done a verse on this it would of been 🔥  Ive been listening to Trigga and Bassman since 96 in the good old helter skelter days. IRAH smashed it as usual and pure 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 from chase and status as usual  cant wait for the next album still playing what came before on regularly and blazer is soooo good. Still playing more than a lot it never ages.

Timeless this
guys, we're in a new generation of drum'n'bass.
Someone decided to drop fire in my cheerios.  Hot damn
This is a massive selection The video is amazing and I like that you get to see Chase & Status, Bou, IRAH, Flowdan, Trigga, Takura and the other participants.
😤
This will go down as one of the greatest DnB songs ever in the future.
Always refreshing to see a divergence from the 'hostile and aggressive black man' trope.....  Tunes banging though.
Huge shit🎉
From the first 20 seconds of this song just knew it was a banger 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
00:12 when u realise drumandbass is everything
420th like 💯
Boomtown 2023 Anthem 🥳🥳🎉🎉
Amazing 🎉
big bad beat ,love it
slaps on the boomtown speakers 🥵
I'm afraid my headphones are not worthy of this banger. They can't play low frequencies. Funny smoke has appeard. Gotta play this on bigger soundsystem. To feel it in the chest. To treat the neighbours with that sweet bass.
L’autre clip est bien meilleur
✌️🥴👍,,,,[🇬🇧],,,,
video is as cringe as it comes, decent track though.
Damn boy ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'll definitely have to look out for the instrumental of this.  Not a fan of the vocals but backing track isn't bad
Big one!
That was something special 😮❤
🚒
Wow 🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely love this!!
amazing song !!!! 🎉
