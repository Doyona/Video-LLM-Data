Thank you Technodad for everything you have done for us ❤❤❤
I like how on "Team Technodad," Floof is there.
ONE OF US
Technodad i have an idea for your channels profile pic. You could take technos youtube profile pic and send it out to a thumbnail artist or just tweet it out and ask artists to make technoblade look old and your pfp as a pig in a crown with a beard and glasses would be a perfect profile pic for your channel.
We should thank you for being here and doing amazing stuff for us to feel comfortable thank you for everything that you are doing and did you are an amazing person and was a good father to techno and a good father figure for the fans out there we love you your amazing 🫶
i like the pbs ending :D

Theres not alot to say which hasnt already been repeated, technodad. Thank you, so much. Youve done so much for so many people over such a short period of time.  Waking up on my birthday last year to a technoblade video "so long nerds" brought me to tears, but from every sun tzu teaching to comedy, techno taught alot of us valuable lessons, such as cherishing what stuff you have as others may not be as fortunate.  I'll write the rest in replies so i don't keep you all reading here, but thank you bossman, really.
floof!!!
Y-Your Welcome Mr. Technoblade😭😭 You're doing so much for us😢😊
Technoblade, his family, his friends and his community may just be the best thing to ever exist on this planet

Dream’s new song is so upbeat but the lyrics and meaning make it so depressing
Thank you Technodad for making a Legend that we can follow! For sure we will carry on his legacy. Before thanking us, we thank you. For making everything possible. And it’s June 1 in my timezone, so happy birthday to Technoblade!! May yours truly, by his sword, his words, and him himself. We will be guided to a bright destiny!
If you had a join button I would do that on 100 alts You are honestly one of the greatest people alive for the fact that you kept Techno's legacy going. (You also saved the lives of his fans)
The man who inspired us all: Technoblade One of the most wholesome and truthful lines ive ever seen written
we thank you <3
Thanks Technodad
Happy Birthday to Technoblade <3 Hope your doing good Mr. Technodad
Thanks Technodad you've done so much in the last year that we all have no words to describe it. We admire your strength and determination to do something with all your pain. You even emotionally supported many of us! Thanks to you, your beautiful wife, and techno's mom for raising such an amazing person like him. ❤ The amount of happiness you brought to all of us after the announcement is just undescribable.  My heart is filled with gratitude and love for all (techno, his fanbase, his family, his friends...).😊

No, thank YOU technodad. For most content creators, their legacy just gets left behind when they pass on and the world continues, but you made the difference, you continued to carry on for technoblade and you really made the difference. truly what sets this family apart.

THANK YOU for carrying on your son's legacy. Techno was and has been a huge reason and inspiration behind a lot of my current passions and is part of the reason I picked my field of study to begin with. Without him, I wouldn't be where I am today honestly. So no, thank you Technodad for doing what you're doing. We seriously love you!

THANK YOU TECHNO DAD!!
That ending killed me LMAO
❤
We love ya Techno Dad, but did you just rip off PBS with that ending? I'm generally curious now.... Have a good rest of your day!
No Mr Technodad  thank you
Technodad PLEASE don’t thank US. You gave us… the most incredible human. You contributed to us.. a world of happiness and laughter in an otherwise dark and scary time. Watching your sons video was an escape from the bullshit and pain of real life. And now you keep his memory alive? Nah. We gotta thank YOU. He was special to us. And we grasp on now to anything we can get to remind us of the joy and happiness felt watching his videos. Most of us needed that laughter.. He was, is, and always will be a hero to us. He’s special.
I think we need to thank you for being here for us when we need it!!
It’s truly an honor to be one of us.
No. Thank YOU, Technodad, for all that you've done. For raising Technoblade, and continuing your son's legacy. Thank you. ❤
I love the little reference at the end ;)
Thank you all for everything. This community means the world to me!❤
🫡 We salute you sir. To take up the mantle of where your son left off was a mighty undertaking but no one else could be the one to do it except you. Technoblade never dies
Thank you technodad
sweetest man ever, nice song from dream in between ^^
Thank you.😊
Technodad is the GOAT
I cant tell you the sheer happiness i felt seeing floof on team Technodad
Thank you technodad.
thank you technodad <3
Strange not seeing BadBoyHalo's name on there or Quackity.. Both massive names from DSMP who did content with techno. I can't help but ask if they'll be any content uploaded to techno's channel, he was so close to 1000 vids and the community is keeping his channel going by watching/liking/commenting etc on his vids so maybe theres some unreleased content that could be uploaded to keep his channel alive too! All that aside MrTechnodad has been amazing, i think he has been what the fans needed and i think he maybe needed the fans aswell to help him move forward and keep going after the loss. Much love from the UK. Keep up the good work
No, Thank YOU TechnoDad!
Thank You
Thank you for continuing Techno’s legacy
Thank you Mr TechnoDad btw, song?
Thank you technodad
he really said “🧍‍♂️” (no hate)
❤
Thank you me technodad. Wait also I just rewatched this and realized that it dream song is the background lmao.
It's amazing that we have an incredible community to support Technoblade even after his loss. Thank you technodad for carrying, and continuing his legacy. Technoblade never dies..
Thank you Mr. Technodad! :)
Not even close baby!!! Technoblade never dies!
Thank you!
Thank you so much to you technodad, thank you for helping in make a the world better ❤❤❤
No, Thank you. Thank you for putting all your effort into continuing technos legacy and remind us of him. Thank YOU. ❤
Happy birthday technoblade it's June 1
Спасибо вам Technodad! 😭Я рада что вы не даете забыть другим про Техно!♡ Technoblade Never Dies!👑 #OneOfUs!!!
Thank YOU, Technodad. If it weren't for you and your son, none of this would've been made possible.
Amazing!!
<3
The like to view ratio is insane on this video
The ending 😂👍
o7
Beautiful how entrenched Technodad has become part of the community to both thank the community and release a snippet if Dream's new song at the same time 😭 thank you Technodad ❤
THE SONG IN THE BACKGROUND IS DREAMS????!
We need to thank you more than you need to thank us. Thank you for being here, Thank you for keeping your sons legacy. Thank you for keeping this community wholesome and loving and thank you for keeping his memories alive with his friends. You doing this means the world to us fans and i bet it means the world to his friends too.
We all love you technodad ❤
Thank you Technodad.

Aww. That is so sweet. But like the rest of the community I believe we should thank you first. From dedicating a whole video for techno's passing ( instead of just a tweet for example) to an elbow reveal. And let's not forget that through your content you carry your son's legacy and prevent us from forgetting him.
can we get him to 1 mil sups
YOURE WELCOME MR TECHNODAD
