God tier Movie
I just wanna know what the musical scene was about as it wasn't in the film D:
Where is that moment when Rebecca and Renfield were smiling at each other? It wasn’t in the movie and it’s not in any of the deleted scenes. I wanna know what is happening there and it drives me crazy!!!
This movie could very well be set in the Dark Universe, with some changes of course.
It's one of those horror movies that's not gonna end up a Classic or anything, but it is absolutely a fun watch that I'll be revisiting this Halloween :D
I love this movie Renfield is awesome and amazing and cool movie
2:16 RENEFIELD RATED R ONLY IN THEATERS APRIL 14 TICKETS ON SALE NOW!
1 year old already!   The movie is silly fun to watch full of gore and surefire laughs in the Louisiana setting  Cage is having a ball playing the role of Dracula and is a dead ringer for Bela Lugosi, brings enough class but also flamboyant energy  Hoult makes for a very sympathetic Renfield just wanting to end his toxic relationship with his master becoming a co-dependent  There's even a point where Dracula argues that maybe Renfield is the real monster for wanting to get rich from real estate at the expense of leaving his wife and daughter Could Renfield be nothing more than a husk (an empty void that can't be filled)? Is he the cause of actual suffering?  It's funny with the scenes during group support Renfield is like many victims wanting to end dependency on bad people We can only grant abusers the power if we let them, you can take it back anytime, narcissists love making themselves feel more important, emotional abuse is the worst kind making us feel weak  The film is super short though and they really could've cut out the lesser villains to take advantage of this fun premise  It's a shame Cage isn't featured heavily more but at this point we are all familiar with his character with an early 2000s mentality  It's a welcome fun change of pace to gain a more deserving form of attention to an iconic villain in literature  This isn’t about finding rationale when it comes to supernatural dominance over another  Plenty of narcissism and gaslighting is sprinkled throughout focusing on a character wanting his independence and own happiness  A fun watch that feels like a throwback to those 1970s Hammer films with some nice gothic aesthetics
Really Bad movie!!!! 2/10
Have to say it again, casting Nick Cage as Dracula. Was the entire point of the film. Literally everything else is merely in support of letting him ham it up as Dracula.
I didn't even whatc it but as I understand from the trailer but now I get it dracula enslaves someone from the middle ages the dude is cursed with immortality he serves dracula he's now ın the modern world some funy cop cames to the game the protoganist explains his backstory bla bla bla they became friends then they kill dracula and everyone lives their lives happy the end.........40% of spoilers from the trailer perfect.... but İt looks like fun let's give a try:)
one off a nice role for nicolas cage
Great movie 🎬 And soooo funny 😂
I'm just glad we get a movie with no agenda... Unless we're trying to elevate the status of Vampires who have struggled for thousands of years and feel that society has unfairly treated them... But I don't think I am getting quite that vibe from this movie 🍿.
残念ながら日本では『レンフィールド』は映画館にて未公開でしたが、日本語吹き替え版がつい最近の11月8日に発売されています この作品は非常に面白かったです！ そして『レンフィールド』の興味深いところは、主人公の救いが単なる贖罪に終わらないところにあると思います さらに言えば、日本人的な感覚であれば、仕方がなかったとはいえドラキュラ伯爵🧛‍♂️の悪事に加担して犠牲になった人（例えば映画冒頭の聖職者達）もいるのだから、罪滅ぼしとして最後に主人公が何らかの報いを受けるはずです しかしこの作品ではそうはなりませんでした それは、勧善懲悪な物語とは一線を画しています さながら私の大好きなテレビゲーム『真・女神転生』のような雰囲気です 長々と書いてしまいましたが、レンフィールドとレベッカの『自由な』未来に幸あれ！
Poor Renfield is in a toxic relationship.
ANOTHER nick cage bomb
I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. Of course, the first time I saw this I set my tv to black and white; made it feel like a proper Universal Monster movie.
Im so PISSED i didnt get to see it because of a bloody accident 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I really wish this wasn't a comedy! I'd love to see Cage as Dracula in a horror movie. Something like Nosferatu or Bram Stoker's Dracula
Flashback of a real ghost rider 🔥
How did Nicholas Cage watch this afterwards and say to himself “Wow everything combined makes this a fantastic movie”. Bad script, bad acting, bad special effects.  Thank goodness I waited till it was $3 to rent rather than seeing it on big screen.
There's no point doing Dracula movies after Mel Brooks. Everytime the actor says in a solemn voice "I am count Dracula" I see Leslie Nielsen's face and go ROTFL
Creep is so fitting here. Radiohead rocks!
I love how my favorite men one who was a Zombie in Warm Bodies and one who was the Ghost Rider are in a movie together those movies and actors are absolute wins!
fun flick, Cage was almost upstaged by the mob boss mom (she was awesome). Now this didn't break ground but who cares... it was fun and had that over the top gore that any fan of Japanese samurai movies or Tokyo police movies loves... totally over the top and done well.  I almost want to see a stuart smalley remix with this trailer...
*J o h n n y, paid his 1º WIFE, L O R I   A N N E    A L I S S O N, B r u c e  W i t k i n’s sister in law, $1.25 M to keep silent, after his divorce.* *B r u c e  W i t k i n, a J o h n n y’s Ex-best friend, testified in the TRIAL that J oh n n y had jealous strike with N i c o l a s  C a g e when he was young*
Best vampire movie of 2023 for sure watching this movie while i passed out Halloween candy this year
I am enough, I deserve happiness, and I take full charge of my life!😢😊
They did  Had to wait till he aged like wine  Sickening actually  I would only watch it to see him destroyed...truly, sick bastard. Just saying 😌 🤷
I really loved this movie
Bombed because of asian.
Love Nicholas Cage in this role. He's so good at adding dark comedy to his roles
I love the background music , Creep. ❤
terrible
This is the sequel to Vampire's Kiss!!! 💋 🦇
A Chinese midget as the heroine! New category of Movie -Direct to the Toilet or Shitter.
Oh man, Morbius II looks sweet!
You have the word of the most trusted institution on earth… ✨the Catholic Church✨!      🤨
Been a fan of Nicolas Cage since National Treasure part 1 and part 2. And I love in him the Cher movie Moonstruck and Spider-Man into the Spider Verse
Brilliant acting and a great film so funny and camp
This trailer showed way too much. I feel like I don't even have to go watch it anymore.
Just watched.  GLORIOUSLY brutal! Did not shy away from presenting Dracula as he is: A MONSTER.  Knowing Robert Kirkman scripted this, makes this film make sense.  I would have thought it may have been Rodriguez or Raimey. Action packed superhero monster movie mash
This whole movie is a marketing campaign for Karl Schwab's to be announced "EAT ZE BUGS" franchise.
Brilliant Movie !!! It’s like Kick Ass meets Blade..
So. Nicholas Hoult gets to play an undead role again. He was "R" in Warm Bodies but now he's more of a rockstar here.
His facial expressions were amazing. Like his “I know you’re lying and I’m pissed off but imma let you finish” face lol
So is this the new Killer in Dead by Daylight? Dracula?
Wow.. someone is salty about the Catholic Church
It seems that another fucking cliche film gonna destroy Nicholas Cage acting
AWESOME!!! ❤ just seen it!! ❤
Worst part about this movie is Nicholas Cage. Best part is he's not in much of it. Good movie. Would've been better without Nic 🤷🏼‍♀️
Oh thank God. I thought for sure the next Dracula movie was gonna be about a transgender vampire that finds out he/she can survive off Bud Ice.
There’s a movie where nic cage gets bit by a bat and thinks he’s turned into a vampire 😂😂
Ummmmmmaaaa wiiiieeerrrddddooooo🎵🎧…I don’t belong…here…😓Runnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 #Radiohead
Vampires are also immortal and they have fang-like teeth.
There will also be Samestra, another vampire and Alysa's classic acquaintance.
Dracula will reappear in Time Shift as his Castlevania appearance; his ultimate and truest version and I will hire Ian McShane to voice him. There's also my mythical character, Alysa Dramenbelt; she is also a vampire and I will hire Jennifer Lopez to voice her. Alysa has loved Dracula very much and will become his wife on Halloween before the curse-ive 13:00!
Transylvania, Romania was the birthplace for all sorts of vampires. Dracula is the king of all vampires.
Vampires are cold-blooded bat people. They are mythical monsters bound for human blood and they can transform into a bat. They are repelled by pumpkins and garlic, they can't see their reflection in a mirror, glass or water, they can entrance anyone to make them their kind, they are super strong and can be murdered by a wooden stake driven through their heart or the sun by its light.
Nicolas Cage had been great for the role of Ghost Rider. He was lead for Ben Gates and Balthazar Blake too. I will hire him to voice Alexandrio MacStonicle.
Nicholas did amazing AS ALWAYS! and so did everyone else! this movie was good, I'm not one for watching anything twice unless there are months in the gap..   But I watched this twice in 1 week.   1.Renfield 2.The Northman 3.Guy Ritchie's the Covenant   Movies I watched almost more then 3 times same month
you are wrong in choosing the actress, but the movie is very good, only the actress is bad, very bad
Now we need Guillermo to show up in the movie
Decent movie, chick cop was terrible. Like a half rewarded,  ugly person
You’ll love it! Worth every penny on pay preview 🧛🏻‍♂️
Wow.. "the Catholic Church"??... who will perform the exorcism on chumpty? Good grief, stop the Catholic hate.  And please--- Nicholas cage as Dracula???😂
0/10
Seriously, this is a masterpiece. And I'm not even kidding. Must watch.
I loved this movie
Excellent film jviens dle finir
Why cant they just leave the original Universal Movies alone.. They are perfect the way they are. They shouldn't be messed with.
Nicolas Cage playing Nicolas Cage in makeup
Fall in asleep while watching, and next day, I deleted this movie. that's how amazing it was. Not worth it watching, as it is boring 🥱
Reminds me of when he did ghost rider
Aquafina is a racist pos
Looks great! Look forward to this.
I just saw this and it's a really cute movie 😂
you guys should watch Vampire's Kiss, he's also a vampire and its so funny. Fun fact, Christian Bale took inspiration from that movie to his character on American Psycho!
This actually looks like a hidden gem. If the trailer got me laughing, I already know I gotta see it!
Radiohead its back
Probably only Nic Cage and Marlyin Manson would be that good in this role.. Wonder if they ever considered Manson though!
I've seen it. This dude actually is fkn awesome as Dracula and he has done some horrible fkn movies.. LOL of all the crap he actually is the Best Dracula I've seen for quite some time
This was a great movie. It had the elements of comedy, action, thriller, horror never a dull moment.  Cage was the perfect Dracula.  This is a must see!!!
Too bad it only made 24 mil!!
Just watched this. If you like films with ridiculous logic, where 4ft women beat up 6'3 muscular men with barely any effort and a story that appears to have been written by a high school student then you'll live this. Utter trash.
I recently saw this and Ghosted.. Both are objectively not great movies. The difference is this is a bad movie that's cheesy fun. Ghosted was a bad movie that should be taken out back and shot.

This looks terrible.
Youssef wahby
LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!
Damn! One of the best Dracula comedy movie so far and all the Actors were really amazing 👍👍👍
Christopher Walken going "RAWR" as the Hessian, and Nic Cage as Dracula...Perfect. just perfect.
Damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥
This looks horrific
Trying to get the audience to side with pigs? Hard pass.
i be disappointed if there wasn't an abandon warehouse or shopping mall scene in the movie.
Good movie. Main villain was thee worst acting I've ever seen. Terrible. Not believable at all. Everyone else was dope. Best I've seen from Nick in a long time. He was my favorite actor till the last 5 years he has made just garbage movies.
Nicholas Cage literally made up his own weird accent for this movie. Nicholas Hoult was amazing though.
“I’m gonna steal the Declaration of Independence”
While watching the movie, I was thinking John Travolta could also make a fine Dracula. And then I remembered Face/Off.   👏👏 the movie is hilarious! And as always,  Nic Cage is 👌
Looks good will watch this
She may be nice in real life but she doesn't fit in the movie. Just my opinion.
Pretty good movie can’t complain surprised how funny n gore it was all at the same time.
this could have been a really fun movie but it was not.
Awkafinapoo is the worst actress I've seen in 32 years of consuming entertainment, every scene she's in feels like an SNL/Marvel skit. Literally no talent.. family begged to fast forward her scenes but ended up turning it off all together. She's just short, annoying and loud but somehow not funny at all.  Stop casting her as a token.
The Catholic Church joke 😭😭
crazy how much promotion this movie got and how completely shit it turned out to be
Waited a long time for this and I give it 3/10 now. Thought it was s*it. Say no more
I have mixed feelings about this. This is both awful and interesting at the same time lol. This trailer confuses me so much...
Vampire Kiss 2023
Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for NATIONAL TREASURE 3
what in actual hell? this movie bombed???? even though its soo FREAKING  GOOD?????!!!!!!!!!!
Looks boring not gonna watch it
marvel humor and its consequences have been disastrous for the human race
20 years after About a Boy, Nicholas Hoult has finally become Hugh Grant.
Great film & finally after decades of waiting Nicholas cage is the natural & perfect replacement for the Drac legend Vincent Price
Such a good film! Nick Cage was born to play dracula!
I like that movie
魔法師的學徒的續集😂😂
They cut the line about the Catholic Church from the movie.
Can someone let me know Renfield's book from the church? 😭
It's Renfin time 🦇
Just came back from seeing this! A pretty solid movie, 9/10!!
Okay this actually looks like a good plot idea, if first, it wasn't so violent, and second, would Hollywood stop making fun of the Catholic Church!? Media is one of the reasons that people think the Catholic Church is evil. It is not evil! The devil is evil, Dracula is evil, Jesus Christ who established the Catholic Church is not evil! Jesus taught us to forgive and love. The Catholic Church is the only one that can fight the dark powers of Satan. If anyone has any questions about the Catholic Faith they can go read the Baltimore Catechism, try listening to the radio station EWTN, and read the Holy Bible (that hasn't been altered by any of the other Christian sects).
I just seen this today movie is fire idc what anybody say 🥳🖤
why not october
Another iconic role for Nicholas Cage and Aquafina's best acting role thus far...
Nicholas Hoult and Nicolas Cage, what a great combo!!! ❤
This was awesome. Nic Cage chef's 💋
mcr
Literally WORST movie evet !!!
Worst movie ever!
"Only in Theaters ... " where it's dark. Right.  Nowhere near enough could you pay me.
As a die hard horror maniac this movie is gonna be better than Deadpool 😮
I love whoever decided to put Radiohead in the soundtrack
Honestly watching the trailer after seeing the movie in cinemas, it was totally worth going to watch.
My problem with this movie is that Nicholas Hault is just too fine and I can’t pay attention to anything but his hotness whenever I see him.
This is just another pain in the neck that I wouldn't want to sink my teeth in.
I never really thought about this scenario before, but when I saw Nic Cage acting out the Count I instantly realized how perfect he fits the role.
😶‍🌫️
May redeem your career with this one!
The most trusted institution on earth The Catholic Church...lol😂
Just watched this movie and realized how many scenes in this trailer don't appear in the final film...
Wow the fact that some of you think this is an “amazing movie” is beyond me! I absolutely love Nicolas Cage, BUUUUUTTTTTT WTF he missed the mark on this one, the role of this character Dracula should’ve been clearly given to someone else….it’s like watching Julia Roberts in Mary Reilly movie 🎥 😂😂😂😂😂😂  I had to fast forward this entire movie,….that’s how ridiculously boring and cringy!  The cast is great if they were playing other roles in other movies 🍿 that’s NOT this one. 🤙
This movie is fun as S H I T, GO WATCHHHH!
oooh  This looks like  "M.T... Greene"   Thanksgiving on a good day.   🤣
Saw it yesterday!    It’s probably his most perfect fitting role to date.      Loved it!
Awesome movie 🎉❤😂😢😮😅😊
It truly has a deeper meaning
I JUST WATCHED THIS MOVIED ON -Soap2day ! FCKN AMAZING
Agora hollywwod so fazem filmes com os mesmos atores, existem outros atores mas eles utilizam sempre os mesmos, muito estranho.
"Haha almost time for Hallowee-" Everywhere I go I see his face
looooks funnnnn
Morbius fits as a better Dracula
I contributed to this movie failing at the box office b/c cage isn’t & will never be Dracula. 😂😂
Hi guys, what's your health plan? *People scream in horror* APPARENTLY IT'S GREAT!!! *Starts shooting his light and dark pistols with smug jazz piano playing in the background*
Awesome movie, loved every second of it.  Hoult and Cage did amazing job! it was super funny and cool in every way.
1,790 dislikes（5%）
This was pretty good.. Nicolas Cage was actually evil ASF
This movie was the ultimate B horror comedy flick! 😂 So fun!
Could they have picked a less attractive female for this?  She has a flat head and no neck.  What is this uglification of females in Hollywood and video games?
both Nicholas are my favourite
Nick Cage will literally do any role
Since its release this weekend critics have been slating it. Can I just say this was one of the best movies I've seen this year, If you go to see movies to simply be entertained, this is for you. Cage is absolutely brilliant as Dracula, the mix of comedy and gore are perfect.
I manifested Nic cage as Dracula I’ve said for years he has to play Dracula
100% cheesy goodness 🤣
"We cast Nic Cage as Dracula!" is one of the best ideas ever!
Nicolas cage plays this brilliantly finnaly a movie that hasn't had some woke twat involved in it
In the end drácula becomes cubes of cement,.  Good movie everybody.
now why do i have a feeling its another movie ruined by the stupid woke cancel culture garbage that runs Pedowood now
Tony got hit by the bus an Dracula saved him 😂
🦇Loved this movie so much!!! 🕷️
The enemy comes to kill and destroy. I pray you all find Jesus
"That's right, Renfield. It's a horrible, horrible job. And you have to do it! You have to!"
looks funny 😂
😂😂😂 he gone still cheat
This movie looks horrible. 😂
Well, looks quite horrible, wonder if he wrote this and is starring in his own film🙄
I will no longer tolerate this bs. I deserved happiness. I had enough, and I will take full charge of my life.  No more being a slave to the gov system, no more 9 to 5, I don't need a college degree.
After watching this I immediately thought of Nicholas Cage's other movie called Vampire's Kiss!
Just watch What We Do In The Shadows.
No need to watch the film, seen most of it now lolol
Why I still can't find a movie in my cinema 😤
Just watched this Masterpiece. It was fucking amazing. Like a fresh air after bullshit movies.
cough i eat bugs, master
Akwaumbolo 😂
This ideal has potential, Cage will shine, but that supporting cast....hmmm I think I see what will bring this one down.
This looks amazing
Ufffff epic
Johnny depp could have done this role
Nick Cage as Dracula is the most inspired casting choice since Klaus Kinski as Nosferatu.
Christopher Lee Is Back!!! 🧛‍♂️
This looks good other than the modern quippy dialogue.
Can confirm, was a 10/10.
y’all please go out and watch this movie
I don’t know why you human make fun of Dracula it’s not so
This movie has everything!
This looks  like WWDITS
well, behold Christian, ur purpose is to serve and worship Him, as he is every where and alive all the time. learn from him, find the virtue of him in every friend you got. obey and serve!  of course, its fun not to serve
Dracula turned in his coffin when he heard of this casting.
Great movie
K !
hell ya cage is back
Movie looks awesome it's a shame it's only 2 minutes and 26 seconds 😒
I've seen the movie, and... I've noticed that a few dialogs from the trailers, are not in the final cut of the movie. So im hoping for a longer directors cut
So it’s Guillermo from What We Do in the Shadows
This was actually pretty witty and funny just a lil too much comic book graphic lol
god bless you two nuns
Aaaaaa wwwwww sssssss ooooo meeeee
Movie sucked. Not enough Dracula and Dracula is beaten to death. I was on his side wtf. Stupid movie about overcoming toxic relationships
Uh huh. Yeah.  Hard core effective therapy. We need this right now.
How is this a sequel to Dracula if Dracula and Renfield were killed
Nic Cage is great... on the other hand, Awkwafina is in the movie, so 50/50
Oh man, they gave away a scenes in the movie that was perfect in their first trailer - NOW we find out Conde Dracula slaughters the group in therapy AND we see Renfield winning the fight after being ambushed in his apartment complex. Dang. Moments like these in trailers I have to wait for streaming service now. Thanks editor, director, producers...
The role Nic Cage was born to play. He’s a victim of the leading man curse. A curse where, an actor obviously has talent, but then he becomes a romantic lead and loses the talent somehow. Vampires Kiss was what convinced me he could actually act. This reminds me of that old Nic Cage
Nick and Nick is such a great duo good lord
I can't remember a Dracula comedy movie since Dead And Loving It!
Akwafina ruins this
Went from a kook pretending to be a vamp to being the kookiest vamp of all time himself. The man has come a long way indeed.
This gives me hella flashbacks of working for my old manager!
I seen the whole movie just by watching the trailer
ugh, you lost me at Aquafina.
glazers do not care do not give them your money do not buy united kits and not buy from sponsers till glazerrs are gone turn off the taps manchester united fans
I learned from fate apocrypha he's also known as vlad the third
Nicholas Cage and Akwafeena is a match made in comedy heaven!
Sometimes a movie relies on its well written story and memorable characters. Other times a movie relies on it's gorgeous visuals and cinematography. And then there are movies that just need Nicolas Cage dressed up as Dracula.   10/10. No notes.
This movie made me laugh so hard, I cried. Great film. Highly recommend it.
Morbius 2
I'm only watching because is those 3 guys in an ordinary Vampire movie. Cnt miss this
Glad to have you back Nick Cage!
Where are the Cullens when you need them?
Reboot the MonsterVerse with a Prequel Dracula Remake with this style of comedy starring Nicholas Cage
Am I the only one who kind of wishes it was some sort of a Con Air sequel?
In a day I easily see the trailer of this movie 20 times, they bombard with this trailer, so much that I hate it already, it's a nuisance that all advertising is the same all day
Oh him? They just film his everyday life, and they become blockbusters. They arrested him once, and he was on the plane, that became a movie. One time he bought a bike, that turned into a movie. One time, someone stole his identity, that also turned into a movie. This one, I witnessed personally.
In his genes. Evil ghost rider and now baptized as Dracula. Nicolas Cage is the man!
Someone has been watching What We Do In The Shadows.
Awkwafina is perfect 😂😂
The Beast meet Ghost Rider. Let see who won
I was hyped until i saw Awkwafina

Does anyone know what shoes Dracula is wearing? at 1:06
I LOVE THIS. Trailer with A Radiohead soundtrack. it feels so good
I like how he’s wearing a medallion similar to the one Bela Lugosi wore in the original 1930s Dracula film! 🤩😎👍  The only thing I feel they should’ve added here was the “widow’s peak” pointy part of hair going down his forehead, also like Lugosi had in the original film! Other than that, he looks pretty AWESOME as Dracula, ngl… 😃😆
This looks like it will be campy gory fun. Nick Cage as Dracula. 🤣🤣 Good to see he is back to making great movies.
If I had a nickel for every time Nicholas cage was a vampire I’d have two nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird it happened twice
Little worried about this after *Vampire's Kiss,* but... as a vampire writer, I think I have to give it a shot
Nicholas Hoult known from Warm bodies , has this role of depression in his acting about stagnant societies and conflicts inside them.  Warm bodies picture the rich elite apartheid from the major civilization taking arms against them. Renfield picture the ancient world elite telling us to jump when told to jump as we're trapped by bonded debts who only death can seperate.

"others call me the lord of death hoo-"
Is this a sequel to morbius? 🤨🧐
Why is there a random Asian lady? She seems kinda out of place in this. And I myself is Asian...
Wow a funny vampire movie. Cool
Not a Nick "Cage" fan at all. But something like this is more suitable for him
I love this song CREEP - RADIOHEAD and how a lot of trailers are being release with great covers.
Pass.
Am i getting through to you? Alva!
Im a vampire, I'm a vampire
*Can someone please explain to me why everyone's saying Nicolas Cage is perfect for the role of Dracula? Are they just being sarcastic or do they genuinely think that? He's just Nic Cage to me in a different costume for all his movies* lol
Evil Dead and this in the same month 😂😂😂
Strangely excited!
Awkwafina is a beautiful S.O.B.  A sexy Oriental bitch or sexy Oriental babe.  A sexy Oriental bitch named Awkwafina.
Every part of this looks good. Hoult, Cage, the make up, the female love interest and the ties to classic Dracula. Wow.
That’s not Dracula that’s Marilyn Manson
Have to say seeing Hoult in red really do give out R vibes
Finnaly tony from skins is getting the spots he deserves cant tell u the dudes real name but ive always been a fan since
I think I'm going to see this movie to see if they'll put Back On The Rocks on the movie's soundtrack.
first warm bodies and now THIS......????, $25.00 says he does a warewolf movie next
Oh good lord 😂😂😂
I love Nicolas Cage 😊 It looks awesome will forsure check it out ❤
Best part of this trailer is Radiohead in the background
"you have the word of the most trusted institution... The Catholic Church"    Ha!! LoL😅
Loved the last trailer but this one makes is not making the movie look good..
you have the word of the most trusted institution on earth "the catholic church"
Wednesday Addam's future husband ??
Creep what a song
aka "Hotel Transylvania" 😁
As a die hardcore horror movie fanatic I can tell u this movie absolutely Has tons of potential to be a great horror movie, I can't believe I'm saying that knowing Nicholas cage is in it
This edit of "Creep" is amazing.
<3
Is Mr Hoult trying to give off a young Deppster vibe here with the floppy hair and pale skin? Not very original 👎
They'd have been better getting Nick Cave to play Dracula. He'd only have needed the teeth 😆
First Nicholas Cage thought he was a vampire in Vampire's Kisses, now he's an ACTUAL vampire.  I'M A VAMPIAH! I'M A VAMPIAH! I'M A VAMPIAH!
Dracula untold was way better
Thought Nic Cage was Marilyn Manson 😅
This movie looks really good. My only concern is paying the price to go see it in the theater and then finding out that it has woke garbage inserted in. It sucks that we live in a day and age where companies just insert all that trash into their films and we're just supposed to accept it
This brings Nic Cage’s “I’m a vampire!!! I’m a vampire!!” quote to a whole new level. 😂
Is it just me or Nikolas cage looks better as a vampire I mean
Surprisingly, Nicolas Cage's face does actually resemble Bela Lugosi's from the 1931 film, "Dracula," at 0:09.
Radiohead playing in the background, love that song
This is so OPIUM
If Renfield wasn’t there in that bar when those guys attacked we would have no more Sisu now 😅
I feel sorry for the priest😅
Please stop giving me ads for this movie, it looks so awful.
Starring Nicholas Hoult as Hugh Grant as Renfield
You guys should check out What We Do in the Shadows.  The show and the movie are both 10/10’s.
Leslie Nielsen, Adam Sandler and now Nick Cage. 🧛‍♂️
I'm not sure about this.🤨🤨 What if it fails terribly?
Please just make this a cirque DU freak adaptation
Fun fact. This might actually not be terrible. Seems like people may have actually worked together and shared creativity vs arguing who gets to put their stuff in the film. I really hope it's as fun as it looks and not lacking in the between action scenes like most nic cage movies.   Cage as Dracula though. Perfection. No folklore creature is closer to reality for him.
perfect casting choice doesnt exi.....
Nicolas cage universe
Finally a movie that looks good 👍🏽 been a min
I can't get enough of "i will no longer tolerate.... Abuse". The delivery is so good.
BEN SCHWARTZ!
All these people saying the casting is genius. What you really mean is that it will make for great memes.
Do you think Nic Cage knows he's just a meme at this point? Or is he still goin for it?
I can't wait for this movie
Renfield has been Dracula's slave for 90 years. If he had a normal life now, he could be dead.
From Zombies to Vampires
From Zombies to Vampires
So Renfield not so quiet quiting now.😂
Vampires kiss 2? Nice!
cool
Looks like he managed to get in shape with all that weight from his previous movie 😂😂
Radiohead and vampires I’ll watch it
Fuck Hollywood trying to turn trash into something
This is just Nanndor and Guillermo from what we do in the shadows
I'm sorry but this seems pretty dumb
nice
*They sure as hell pick the right character to play as Count Dracula lol....Nickolas Cage is spot on* 🤣🤣🤣
Count dracula speaking the lady we deserve happiness
Saw an advance screening of this, and it wasn't good. I could be wrong though, because I felt like an alien from outer space whenever the whole audience lost their shit at one of the many unfunny scenes in the movie. The action, and for some reason there is lots of it, is pretty terrible for a big studio film. Then again, the last movie I watched was John Wick 4, so maybe that's too fresh in my mind.   It had its moments. Nicholas Cage as Dracula is the most obvious redeeming quality, and it goes pretty much exactly how you'd expect. It just made me want to see him do a more serious take on it though. He clearly had fun and is fun to watch.
This looks like a good bad movie
Why are all Nicholas Cage movies bad.
Was that a redone Depech Mode song?
Not going to lie, this looks pretty BADASS!!!
Why is Awkafina in this?
Ugh...  The loud mouth unphased comedic girl from marvel shan chi is in this movie. 🙄 She's the equivalent to the other Asian girl in star wars 7-9. That character is not needed. She is cringe. #haterofhercharacter&herbadacting
Well this happened lol
Very interesting move
Nicolas + Nicholas = 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤❤❤
Nicolas Cage finally decided to play himself!
So this is what a "Vampire's Kiss" will do to you huh 😄😄😄😄😄😄 #NICCAGEISLEGEND
OPENS UP IN THEATERS ON MY DADS BIRTHDAY . LOL
😂😂😂😂😂  “The most trusted institution on Earth, The Catholic Church.”  Comedy gold   😆🤣🤣🤣😆🤣
Looking forward to this! 😂
Nicholas Cage in a movie playing in theaters instead of direct to video 😅😂
Finally ❤
Actors are getting ever more proficient but very few are stars. Cage is one of the few remaining with star quality.
For those of you who obviously must know oh so much about art,  I recommend that you watch, in its entirety, "In Defense of Nicolas Cage" on YouTube. Just try. And then ask yourself what you REALLY think.
"IM A VAMPIRE, IM A VAMPIRE"
Manson looks great here.
It's just a movie come back to reality 😃
"I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!! I'm a vampire!!!! " 😂😂😂 anyone know what I'm talking about?
Nick Cage as Dracula just seems corny to me. He overreacts to the hilt and really does in this one.
Nice vedio
Cage does look a lot like Lugossi.
Uuuh ok there has to be some gen Xers who may have the peggy sue got married vibes when you see Nicholas cage as Dracula. 😅😅😅
As a Tanya Markova fan, I appreciate they use their song ❤
Nic Cage has been one of my favorite actors for over 30 years now..going back to when I was just 7 years old barely speaking English and i love him even in his worst movies...but damn am i glad he's having this resurgence..   Let the NicoNaissance continue
Ima just watch it, no trailers
This movie looks like shit but nick cage as dracula has my ticket
Wow that was a crappy movie
EVIL DEAD RISES 🤘
Radiohead's "Creep" is a nice touch of music.
Another trash movies
Filmed in New Orleans you know it's gonna be hilarious. Love my city❤❤❤❤❤
1:55-1:57 either Renfield and Rebecca are going to be a romantic couple or have a brother-sister bond, I’m leaning a little towards the latter 💙
I AM FREAKING PSYCHED!!!!!!!!!😊A GENRE THAT CAGE WAS BORN FOR!!!!!  LUV U NIC!!!🎉❤
So, the very old photo that said he was immortal its true...
why do i have the feeling that dracula won't die in the end......... i mean i have the feeling that  renfield will defeat dracula in the end but he'll still spare his life, then there will be clips of renfield happily living his life, meanwhile we will have comedic clips of dracula slowly but surely adapting to modern life while searching for his new servant......
I don't know what p**** bulshit this is but renfield needs to just die in a dumpster fire what the f***ever
How funny would it be if all Nicholas Cage fans got together and inspired a movement to make this movie reach a billion dollars just to see Nicholas Cage say he's back baby 😅
This may even be better than Morbius.....I know its blasphemy to think 😐
I cant wait..... Looks awesome
That's Nickolas Cage being normal
I will be at the IMAX Friday afternoon before all the traffic!
Nicolas  cage does not deserve to look like this
Ok, Over 16 million views and only 27k likes, The fuk is wrong with you people?
I'VE NEVER MISFILED ANYTHING. NOT ONCE, NOT ONE TIME  A B C D E F G H ....
So we are bastardizing Dracula... nothing new here. What's the point?
At lease the y pick someone who wouldn't  have to act  as avampire
Love this version of Creep by Radiohead and I knew I've seen that young actor before. He was in Warm Bodies. And of course, Nicholas Cage and his creepy character, Dracula just fits. 😆
This is one of those trailers that shows so much of the movie I think "Good, now I don't have to see it, but maybe on an airplane."
What fabulous camp!! Can't wait!
I didn't know Cage would look good as Dracula, huh
The Sorcerer's Apprentice Pt. 2? 🤔
That last part made me chuckle.
Perfect casting...can't wait to see it.
I'm so excited about this! Looks like a really cool boss/dad revenge fantasy
Looks like more CGI special effects cobbled together into another expensive piece of crap... ho hummm
Oh look, MCU does drak. Yawn.
I haven't  sat through a full movie in years more less went to the cinema but this movie might be the exception.  Looks like fun!
I feel like they showed the whole movie in this trailer 😢
This looks incredibly stupid.  I remember when they used to make good movies.
Banger trailer
Look at give this a thumbs down because after the menu I'm not going to be fooled twice fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
Why MUST Hollyweird attack the church? It’s like God is Holy Water to Hollyweird’s filth🤦🏽‍♂️. I guess when you are desperate, you attack anything for cheap laughs.
Can't wait to see this!
Long live Donald the lion hearted king of MAGA.
The enemy comes to kill and destroy. May Jesus work in your hearts.
This looks fire
This looks gay af.
I must have this in my life 😊
This movie is going to be terrible, but they atleast got Nick Cage.
This looks awesome! :) Cage has got some serious Bela Lugosi vibes!
“I’m a vampire!! I’m a vampire!!!!!” Nick cage.
😂😂😂😂 this movie will get the highest rating of 5/10. The people commenting positively about this trailer, have they been hired by the movie company?🤔🤔🤔🤔
Better be rated R
Didn't this movie come out like 8 months ago?
A vampire playing Nic Cage is gold
It doesn't look like it's going to be a great movie. I hope am wrong.  But Nicolas cage, an Awesome actor! So just wait and see.
Is this a real movie? Lol i may watch this one for cage as Dracula lmao! Oh man
Hi
Very nice video
anoder cop nicol azz  MCU!
Nicolas rage 😈
Dude that's how you get people interested in a movie
i didnt know they made a film about carti but it looks cool
Who's here from 1600ish??? This motion picture is of my cousin...
Why did they try to make 'Creep' sound cinematic lmao
Went from Johnny. Went wrong Johnny Depp and Nicolas Cage
Nicholas Cage as Dracula? It's about time.
Not Cage's 1st role as a vampire
Well at least I don't have to see the film anymore because YOU SHOWED US THE ENTIRE MOVIE! LOL on a real note though I will be seeing this
Release date ......?
Nicks been a vamp he ain't even acting here. He finally gets to be himself.
This movie looks like it’ll either be the biggest load of new age new wave film bullshit or ppl are gonna fetishize and meme Nicholas cage until this shit is as famous as morbius
I thought this was super realistic but it's done funny
This movie i would definitely sink my teeth into Nicholas hoult and academy award winner nicholas Cage are brilliant.
is this a sequel to the unbearable weight of massive talent?
Basically a vampire kinda beetlejuice, hell yeah, I hope it becomes a legendary movie for ages
Warm bodies 2.0
Wow cant wait!!!
nice
good
New Orleans is the perfect backdrop for this movie.
Funny Draco 😂
I guess "Space ass" was delayed ?
Isn't dracula is looking like suicide squad's joker?? 😅
Ghostrider vs Beast
yea nah
Renfield Dark Shadows meet Vampire in Brooklyn
I'm so happy to see Nicolas Cage.Woww!😍
Come on, every German would instantly recognize Castle Neuschwanstein in the beginning. Point deduction for that. Still looking forward to the movie, though.
OMG!!! This looks exciting!
Ok i will definitely watch this. 😁
This does not look promising. A movie I absolutely will not watch and I will be happy with it 😊
I hope we care more for Dracula then Renfield.
Would it kill them to hire an attractive leading lady?
The only reason I'd even consider watching it is Nicolas Cage but even the trailer is shit.
ITS COOL
Now we just need renfield vs morbius, Jared Leto vs Nicholas Cage in an upcoming movie.
IS THAT TONY STONEM
Why does this actually fuck though, im deeply upset
It looks like a pretty fun and cool movie, its peaking my interest so i'm probably gonna go watch it. Ngl I really liked the "I deserve to be happy" theme, that line really stuck with me
I want thiiiissssss.. 👁️👄👁️
-
I swear this trailer gave me nightmares..
Morbius, but if it was a good movie
This is a better version of Morbius
Nc is Perfect for the joker
Looks good, can't wait too see it ❤
When Renfeld goes JOHN WICK and it’s BRILLIANT!!  Ps. Creep cinematic epic version here is too loud. Try listening to THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM and SEASON IN THE SUN from JW 3-4. Excellent rendition.
Neuschwanstein Castle 🏰🇩🇪 Nicolas Cage ❤
Another anti Christian movie, Hollywood never learns, 😔...
I hope that traitor renfield gets killed…. Doubt it though 😒😒😒
I am vampire ,I am vampire ,I am vampire. my dream come true
They just basically showed the entire movie in the trailer 🤦
can someone tell me what Dracula says at 1:34 please?
Nicolas Cage looks like an Akshay Kumar from another world 🌎
lead actor becoming the new johnny depp the more people look at him...he is very similar during depp younger years
Catholic Church: The most "trusted" institution on earth Me: This is gonna be a comedy gold
Buat im a creepppppp
Great good work
and he is acting like a hay lgbt dracula lol yeah right buddy. lol cage gets it up the hole
cage allowing the disrespect of cstholics just shows he is part of the woke movement. he is a broke sellout just like the rest of them.
Could this movie beat morbius??   Yes.
I’m super excited for this Nicholas cage is my favorite actor ever since face watched that movie when I was young and I’ve always favored him
Nice video
its papa drac...😂😂
Nicholas Cage worst movie is Ghost Rider
Nicolas Cage dons the fangs for the first time since 1988's Vampire's Kiss. Only this time he's an *actual* vampire.
Cage is just one hell of an entertainer for sure, even if some of his films suck.
Honestly, in a few scenes Nick actually kinda looks like Bela.
I love this man. THANK YOU NICKOLAS FOR YOUR GIFT TO THIS PLANET
is that for kids, because it looks like that to me .. .
Nicolas Cage is bloody brilliant! (See what I did there?)
Only slightly off-topic, but I want a Face/Off sequel.
THIS COULD BE A HIT..!! FANGS OUT...LETS EAT...!
I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire! I’m a Vampire!
I love vampires! I can't wait for this to come out.
😍
It feels like a mix of Joker and Morbius, except somehow worse.
This Looks way better than any Marvel Movies since End Game
❤, I want Alucar live action😊
disgusting hollywood movie. yuck
Hmmm  I get it…This must be for the dumb left woke audience 😂
Ughhh hellllll noooooooo! Wtf were they thinking for Draculas sake sheeesh🙄
WHY IS CREEP PLAYING
It would've been perfect if they made Dracula speak a slight Romanian accent
Hopefully not another propaganda movie
When Sorc.. I mean Dracula try to kill his apprentice. Cough*
Nicolas Cage is the best vampire casting since Robert Quarry playing Count Yorga!!!!
Looks done on the cheap?
Nice one.
I enjoy watching trailers in order to know what to avoid. Thank you.
This look way more promising than the last vampire movie we got in store
RUUNN! THE ELEVATOR SHAFT! And make it quick, I’m in Dutch with the wife.
#savejurassicparkoperations
Nah that’s gonna be the next Morbius yo!
Nicholas Hoult 👏👏👏
Wow
Dracula is about how white people feel about themselves. They hate themselves so much that when they look in the mirror they see nothing. Like a vampire doesn't have a reflection. The only time they feel alive is when they can hate on black people and degrade them or just have them around. They would feel nothing otherwise. Speaking of white people collectively.
1:28 😂😂😂😂😂
i would watch anything with Creep in the background
When I saw Nicolas Cage as Dracula for the first time, as a vampire fan, I was absolutely floored.
we stan Nicholas Hoult's happiness since Warm Bodies
https://youtu.be/wzrlNNsfv4k - the little mermaid story
THE GOAT
GOATOLAS CAGE🐐
Nicolas vs Nicholas nonetheless
Dracucage: “I couldn’t think of a more horrible sentence if I wanted to, and you HAVE to do it, or I’ll kill you do you understand?!”
Another meme templates i guess
Legend actor nicolas cage....
potential new nic cage meme...
I love Dracula and all kinds of horror movies.
Most hyped a trailer has made me in the past two years
Been a fan of Nicholas Hoult since watching The Great (awesome show, he and the rest of the cast are perfection) so I'm really excited for this!
You know when you hear "he was meant to play to role", well... Dracula was written and meant to be played by Nicholas Cage
CREEP
*sigh* here we go again.   Somebody call Arthur, Mina and old VH. We got a Drac to wack.  We’ll see how this one fares against actual Christians, not the obviously fake one Hollywood is using here because they don’t like that Dracula’s kryptonite is Christ so they like to just pretend that the  power of Christ ain’t real.   The Count will see how real the power of Christ is when gets a bowie in the chest and a kukrie through the neck.   WE RIDE!
🤣
Crazy
A músic Creep ficou boa como trilha.
I heard that Cage stayed in character while on set.  He also ACCIDENTALLY drank his own blood.  I'M NOT KIDDING.
Ghost Rider (Nicholas Cage), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Katy, Sonic the Hedgehog (Ben Schwartz)
Muzan is that you?
Serve good people .
Nice Astarion prequel! 😊
How shall we alienate half of our audience before they even see the film? I know! Let's rag on The Catholic Church. No one ever does that and it always makes people happy...
ok a good good movie
Why are teaser trailers always better than the full trailer?
1:50
*Looks terrible.*
you will know its a great movie if Nicolas Cage is one or is the Main Character on a Movie ^_^
Despite how interesting the movie looks, you can definitely tell this is a movie made in Current Year when the male lead is prettier than the female lead.
Actually, Nicholas Cage seems perfect in this part.
I mean Nick Cage’s character pretend to be a vampire over 30 years ago for “Vampire’s Kiss” so why not have him play an actual one.
Looks like a fun time in the cinema. Its not something grandeur, but im definitely looking forward to see Nick cage do what he do best.
No entendí
A literal Bat Man's Batsman, with super powers, and immortality?  ... where exactly does one sign up?
Nicolas Cage and Nicholas Hoult! Perfect casting!!
Nicholas cage is always   great entertaining
Did they just give away the whole plot in this trailer?
Nosferatu Cage👴
Way to show the entire movie.
First comes Ghost Rider, then comes Dracula.
i don't even know what is this... but my spirit animal bless!! let's go 😂
Dracula is a genius whoever decided to make
am youtuber❤❤❤🥀🥀 मैं यूट्यूबर हूं🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🥀🥀❤️ Mera tech channel hai मेरा टैब चैनल है🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 mere channel se aapke help ho sakti hai❤❤❤❤ मेरे चैनल से आपकी हेल्प हो सकती है❤❤❤ nice video
Wow
Crap
Nicolas Cage would be perfect for Marvel Sinister
Just another shitty film.
Nick Cage finally gets to be the Vampire he always thought he was.
They should make ez mil- moonlight theme on this shttt
Nooo grntita van a quemar creep
I like the part where Aladdin says to the monkey “that’s my banana nut bread, get your own..bitch”.   Yes, that scene.
They low key just used Neuschwanstein... 😅
Well I’m here for this! Opening weekend I will be there and if it is as good as these trailers are I might go twice.
Kenapa ya... Di beberapa adegan di trailer ini–di akunya–berasa kayak Bollywood 😭
Wasn't this guy the beast in the X-MEN
Ngl mark strong would have make a better dracula. Just look at him in the Sherlock movies.
Next they will cast Nic cage as Frankenstein or Hulk
Count Dracula? Okay. One.
So great creep by radiohead is still being recognized  as a great song
Homestuck
From Zombie to Vampire/Dracula?
The Ghost Rider is Lord Dracula 🤣🤣😂😂😂
good
I haven't been interested in seeing a movie in a movie theater since before COVID.   Until now...
I'M A VAMPIRE I'M A VAMPIRE I'M A VAMPIRE I'M A VAMPIRE I'M A VAMPIRE I'M A VAMPIRE
Nicolas Cage as a vampire 🦇! It looks very interesting. I'll def be watching this one. I miss good Cage movies.
Cage as Dracula was a bad move. I don’t understand why Universal did this. At some point studios need to come up with original characters.
awkbafila
The apartments are from Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones!
From ghost rider to Dracula.
after watching so many "serious" dracula adaptations, i'm so glad we're going the what we do in the shadows route. i'm so here for it.
This looks so good. I love how the genre of buddy cop movies are surviving by acknowledging that a relatable cop is just as plausible as a relatable vampire.
I'm gonna see this one
Please dubbed in tamil languages
1:50 Oh look at that! Nicholas Holt is dressed as his character R from Warm Bodies!
Yooo Nick Cage in this movie looks like Christopher Lee's Dracula!
3 days ago
radiohead‼️‼️
Shit
So the guy in vampires kiss became a vampire after all
FINALLY....a nicholas cage character I can actually like lmfao
Jean Ralhpio is in this movie!
CANT WAIT
Not my Dracula and NOT the kind of film i think this should be. I expected a classic monster feel not this comedic garbage
I just do not like the Dracula casting.
Ghost rider vibes man!!!
He has the face for it
The last time I saw Nic Cage having this much fun was when he was play Castor Troy in Face/Off.
I want this movie for sure, might be Cages best work.
I just searched for the song and I saw this.
I am sooooooooooo ready for this movie and I am waiting for the squeal. ♥
This is a very well made trailer!
This looks SO fun and so good!! I can't wait to watch it! Ben Schwartz too, heck yes!
Nicolas Cage❤❤
I was interested until I saw Aquafina 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮why she is in everything.
look like warm bodies  XD
can't wait ... can't wait ......can't wait .......can't wait
miss you nicolas cage acting ghost rider
Shut up & take my money!
This is going to be Nicolases best movie Ever
Nice video 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Tamil dub pls Indian languages tamil telegu dub pls
Cage is just perfect in these kind of movies! :D Looks fun movie.
Only legend know about the hero ☺️ in warm bodies movie
One day, killing undead animatronics, the next day, killing and chilling as Dracula.  Living the dream.  Nicholas Cage.  The legend.
More Renfield content, YIPEEE!
I just hope this film is a huge hit and a good movie so can Nicolas Cage can relaunch his mainstream career
Looks absolutely terrible – even more so than expected.
The One True God is back!
The real actor here was the guy who delivered _the most trusted institution on Earth_ line without bursting into laughter.
omg robert standing up to dracula with that speech was so hilarious bc it reminds me of the Gen z wanting to be more free and less offended by ahahahh ''i will not tolerate this aBuSe'' so good even the affirmations ahahah i feel like this movie needs to be watched by billions of people, everyone share
👍
TO be completely clear with everyone, I don't care about the movie. I have a feeling it's gonna be shit. I just want to see Nicholas Cage being Dracula. That is bound to be gold no matter how bad the film is.
Nandor the relentless looks different 🤔
I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! lmfao
I hope this is the start of a new Dark Universe reboot.
BRING BACK SUPERMANCAGE!!! PAKDC🤩
I learned how stupid the movie is from this trailer. I will purchase an AMC ticket and watch in theaters though.
Who've decided to make cage dracula 2 a freakin' genius.
Pull saport you vedeo
Looks incredible!
Thumbs
Thia might be worse than Cocaine Bear
Wow the actor Renfield is on his second zombie style movie he was RRRRRR in the Romeo and Juliet twist of a zombie movie Warm Bodies.  In the end he also returns to being human.
Tamil dubbed plz
i guess i just figured out my son’s bday gift :) not that he will like it :) but i will :) looking forward for NC as Dracula and yeah… Renfield seems badass :)
Why does Dracula sound like Bane?
He is perfect as Dracula. Popcorn and sour patch time
Aweeeeeesome
Nicholas Cage ? Yes please .
Is so good to see Nic back at it
This film captures a lot of the current culture - toxic work environments, bosses that feel that - just giving you work means you owe them, overwork and burn out as a culture. Can't wait to see where they go with it.
Funny thing is 😂 Renfield is one of my most favorite characters of Bram Stroker's dracula.
Finally a Hollywood movie that looks good!  I haven’t seen those in a long time!
Huh, Season 5 of What we do in the shadows looks really cool
The earlier trailer was sooooooo much better.  I don't know if it's the music or the way the video clips were strung together, but this trailer took me from "Gotta see this movie!" to "Meh."  I'll probably still see it though.
Is this a documentary on Nic Cage?
Radiohead ,,Creep"  just passed 30 years.
I'm usually not into camp, but this looks pretty great
I hope i at least get to be there when Dillian kills Dracula. I don't think I will be, though.  Everyone knows vampires are our enemies right?  However the greatest monsters wear human clothes.
Nic the kind of a guy, who will do anything to entertain us 😂
Don't care about the movie just watching for King Cage
nic hoult went from zombie to vampire, he monster hopping
Finally daywalker
Looks like that dude out of pirates of the Caribbean
Creep Radiohead
2008-ass movie.
Nicholas Cage as Dracula, this is gonna be a fun one.
Old is Back
Renfeilds freaking out at the end. "I serve you, thats my JOB! I need to have some joy in MY LIFE or there will be no reason to live!" Nic cage finally relents, "Your days are yours as long as your nights are mine." "There are worse prices for immortality."  This sounds like a fun way to end it without killing Dracula.
I wonder what happened to Paul Feig "Dark Army" movie? 🤔
Nic Cage finaly is in a good movie again. Thank you Hollywood !
And then rainbows comes to ruin it...
Two Nicholas in one frame..That's amazing 😍
Did we really need a sequel to Vampire's Kiss?
cool
I suppose Beast got demoted. Like A LOT!
Love the part where Dracula says "it's Draculin' time' and draculs the shit out of everyone
A bits misspelled perhaps
Mein Herr
Itsa vlad the impaler
Braumstoker
This trailer saved me two hours in my life. Everything good or bad about the movie, including all plot points, is in the trailer. So I saved time and money by viewing the trailer. Thank you.
If this movie don't have a scene of Cage going full "I'M A VAMPIRE I'M A VAMPIRE I'M A VAMPIRE" I'll be disappointed
Radiohead is perfect for this trailer.
I wonder if Jay Baruchel gave Nick Hoult a commiseratory call, a few tips on how to deal with being  the titular character, yet Nicholas Cage is somehow the main character....simply because that's Cage's personality or presence or some damn thing...
Nice to hear Radiohead used in the movie.
Welcome Back Nicolas!
very nice dracula
How does cage still get work????
What a disappointment they cast that women. Her lack of talent and comedic skill really detracts from the trailer’s appeal and film’s potential.
Is this how Guillermo future may be if he's brave enough to leave Nandor the Relentless??
Mandy was crazy good !  This one will not dissappoint either !
This might be the exception to all the crap Hollywood is puking out these days.
This looks great
Good or bad, this movie will definitely be a fun one.
Take all my money 💰
Regular employer-employee relationship.
This is Nicholas cage 1988 vampire's kiss spin off
better then morbius 😂
This looks fun as hell xD
😲 Wow I love this movie 🎥 it feels I'm back to the 80s. I can't wait to watch it. I love 💞 luv ❤️ it 😘
This actor is weird. He played as a twilight zombie in warm bodies, beast in xmen, now as a vampire. Can someone give him normal roles please?
Vampire's kiss goes full circle ❤❤❤
I miss Christopher Lee now..
HAHAHA! YEAH!
The whole plot and story of the movie was in the trailer...why would I go see the movie when I can guess how it ends already?
Last few secs ...it felt like Shang chi
Come back is real, Let’s go Nick
bravo awesome...
Yeay creep❤
I so look forward to seeing this.  Love Nicholas Cage and Nicholas Hoult. #NickNick
Dracula again? Seriously  Good casting though
Akshay Kumar of Hollywood, Nicolas cage
woah funny
Orchestra  "Creep"   is  creep.
Sequel to Vampire's Kiss?
He got the best expressions in all of Hollywood. He knows the meaning of acting.
love nikolas cage, hate akwafinas terrible acting. so im split
Somehow, Nick Cage as Dracula just kinda works. I won't question it🤷🏽‍♀️
It's great to see awkwafina speaking in her real voice. 😂😂😂😂😂
Aw. kwa. fina. 🔥❤‍🔥🔥
Why are there not comments about the 1860s(?) photograph that popularized the Nicolas Cage is a vampire joke?
Abed would wreck his head over this.
"The most trusted institution on earth, the Catholic church" got me 😂
Why is awkwardfeena in this... Otherwise LOOKS DOPE!!
Renfield 😁😁😁😁 Finally a movie about Drac"s assistant..I remember the Leslie  Nielsen version and Renfield was so hilarious
Morbius 2 looking sick ngl!
Is the 90 years later part, is that charity hospital?
So this is sequel (or prequel) of Vampire kiss
Hell yeah i'll watch nicholas hoult as a depressed zombie (again) and now with creep playing in the background.  I just hope this trailer didn't give away everything.
#AdvPankajMhatre
At this point Nic Cage could play a tree and I'd go see it just to see what strange improv he'd throw into it 😂😂😂 Nic Cage is a legend !
It may be comedy, but what's being depicted here is pure evil and the devil is using this medium to deceive people into thinking that cult and devil worship is good and fun. No it isn'. Be vigilant people. Jesus is coming soon.
On the power on El Shaddai Elohim Adoni Ahcad Shama Israel El Roi  On the power on St Gabriel  On the power on St Michael  On the power on Virgin Mary  All the bad gads and ufo will be in the middle on volcano forever and ever Amen
Nick kind of looks like Monroe looking like a vampire.
april's fool.  they're actually making a new ghost rider movie instead
There is no way in hell I'm going to watch this in the theater, but when it hits Redbox I'm there.  Watching Nicholas Cage as Dracula is going to be a treat.
............... Why do I want to watch this so much.....?  I feel like I need help.
用這個面孔演，就是在醜化華人，
Morbius 2
That's Neuschwanstein Castle they used at the start. I've been there. It's a beautiful place. I highly recommend visiting it.
I don’t know how this movie is going to be. But this movie surely has meme potentials.
Vampyre
Um...yeah that was *waaayy* more touching than i was expecting....like bro i got kinda emotional ngl. And Nicholas Cage as Dracula is straight up perfect casting 👀🚬
Sorry, it dosen’t look good. I expected more.
This looks positively absurd. So over the top, it might actually work.
I hope Cage runs around yelling "I'm a Vampire! I'm a Vampire!"
I am actually going to the theater to see this.
I'm gonna watch this fo sho
Nicolas Cage: I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!
This is going to be amusing. Not hilarious, I mean... it's Nicholas Cage. But still probably worth a watch.
I'm in
"I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!"
Renfield discovered his grandfather's name was Simon Belmont
Take away the cool backing sound track and almost everything is just truly horrible, bomb incoming
https://youtu.be/Lct6x-XqWrw
There isn't one movie that I like from this guy.
i literally need this movie more than I need air
Ocupat
You just saw every funny bit.
Of course.  The non-descript, schlubby Asian.   Keep diluting it down.  Your trained lemmings question nothing.
This looks so incredibly stupid eight tickets please. No, no, I'm alone. I wanna watch it eight times.
How the fuck does awkwafina still get movie deals…
Nicholas cage is already Vampire obsessed naturally in his private life so casting him for this role makes total sense!! I'm excited to see it :)
The first trailer looked so awful this trailer has made me very excited to see it
Wow this looks horrible lmao
Nicolas Cage looks like Bella Lugosi!!!
you know those movies that are so bad they are kind of good? im betting this will be one
02:02  That's meme material right there.
definitely will see this with my friends!
So great to see him doing movies again...
And they basically just showed all the twisted turns and outcome of the movie
When you find yourself on set with these actors you know you’ve either fed up taxes or are the bottom of the Barrel and cage was one at the top😂
Sorry but this movie looks awful and stupid
looks bland and unoriginal
HELL YEAH!
I was happy until I saw awkwafina
Excited for this!
Nic Cage the greatest living actor today no one is close.
So you know this movie is gunna suck. I mean all the signs are their Nicolas Cage a vampire perfect when’s the last time he made a movie that didn’t suck so let’s makes him king of suckers
So is this Nicolas Cage's final form?
This looks absolutely hilarious.  Dracula with a Valley accent! 😂😂
Looking forward to not watching this
Cocaine bear meets Nicolas Cage .. garbage
Complete with nondescript made up accent. 😂
Nicolas Cage is the only thing that looks good about this movie.
A comedy about toxic friendships of ... hellish proportions. :)
sean penn this movie will shut you up
2023 zombies and vampires still very popular...
Seeing Nicolas Cage as Count Dracula in this movie is like me seeing a fusion of Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee, because that's what I am now seeing from the Count Dracula in this film, the Nicolas Cage version of Count Dracula in this new film is a cross between the Bela Lugosi version of Count Dracula and the Christopher Lee version of Count Dracula.
My dad got me into the universal monster movies. I always said once they did igor that renfield should be done. Now boom
Bro nick cage is  so happy that he can finally get to use his vampire power for amovie
Was that Squad Loadout theme from XCOM 2?
Lol so cheesy. Nic cage is a dweeb
cussing is lame
Nic just fits that role so great. But I dont really know about the rest of the movie tbh
Nick is the WORSE ACTOR to ever live. His speech is like he is trying too hard.
Meh, I'll wait for the Rifftrax
Nicholas Cage as Bela Lugosi
Dayum, they just spoiled the entire movie
Shang Chi: 😢😢😢
Nic cage.. superman, Ghost rider, dracula, maybe next tym cage as son goku or captain America 🤣🤣🤣
Well now you don't have to see the movie
Nick your scraping the bottom of the barrel now. Sorry
On the subject of vampirism, what is the origin of it? Transylvania? Dracula? I am Legend? No, vampirism is thousands of thousands of years old and goes back to the Canaanites in the Torah, these people not only sacrificed humans but ate them, raped them, drank their blood and all for worship toward their baal, their god by today's standards would seem merciless and evil, but in the culture of the world today alot of people say that the Christian God is barbaric for telling people to turn from sins, but the fact of the matter is you don't have to be a blood drinking satanist to go to hell, you can be a person who deems themselves good, but not by God's standards, only God is good so therefore we fail God's standards because He is absent of evil, we must turn to His perfect son Jesus and repent of our sins and follow Him, or eternal death still abides for us
Nicolas Cage and Awkwafina in the same movie together… this movie is going to flop so hard
rip hollywood. this is so incredibly bad
The Catholic Church 😂 think this worth seeing better than Shazam 😂😂
Vampire's Kiss: "You know, I'm something of a Nic Cage vampire movie myself."
The first trailer was meh, this trailer actually got me wanting to see this movie.
I never thought I’d see the day when Nicolas Cage not only was cast as Dracula but also channeled the late great Sir Christopher Lee so well!!!!
Yet another movie that shouldn't of been a movie, nicolas cage should not be a actor as he has literally lost his charm in acting, nothing he makes is funny anymore, either its cringy as fuck, or its just downright annoying and stupid, as well as his voice is just fucking god awful nowadays.
Awkwafina's there to bring every scene to screeching halt, looks funny otherwise
Take my money 😂😂
Morbius? Origins?
dumb woke libs may like this
Does someone know what song plays near the end of the trailer?
How did no one see Jean Ralphio 😂😂😂😂
im ready
https://youtube.com/shorts/lRUk_ai6w-k?feature=share😱😱😱😱❤😍😍😍
The first time I saw the trailer I was like wtf but now I kinda really wanna watch it😂
This looks fun !!!!
This one might almost be worth going to the movies finally
Neve Campbell Keanu Reeves Nicholas Cage Brenden Fraser  The 90's icons are slowly making a come back.
Bro this looks like a hilarious film
A movie with Aquafina is no good movie at all…even with Nicholas Cage, who I think is amazing.
Nicholas Cage at his absolute bat shit mental finest, cannot wait for this
When I saw cage disguised as Dracula my first thought was what the fuck but honestly by the end of the trailer I kinda want to watch that movie and it doesn’t seem so bad.
If Morbius was good
Hollywood just brought back the NY discoteque. Don't P.A.N.I.C. but Renfield was Dracula's True Blave and Manny!
Sorry to say this but seems like a cheap knock off to  'what they do in the shadows' from the comments read seems like everyone thinks the writing of this movie is original. Definitely look up what we do in the shadows, TV series is a masterpiece, haven't seen the movie version yet so can't comment on it
We have some real movie fans on here...just about everyone spelling Nicolas Cage's name wrong.
Is that Nicolas Cage! Nick has to have the Guinness Book of Acting roles. Long live the King 😂
nice movie content
What if this is just a sequel to Vampire's Kiss?
Movie looks stupid but N. Cage makes a cool Dracula
It's been ages since we've had a completely evil Dracula on the big screen. Here's hoping this movie's good.
I don't normally write movies down on my calendar, but I've had this written down for a couple of months. April 14th. I HAVE TO SEE THIS. I freaking LOVE Nic Cage, and I'm way too hyped about him playing Dracula. Y'all did perfect casting with this one. Holy crap!!! I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!
Solid 2.5/5
No snowball chance in hell i watch this movie with nicholas cage in it
Awkwafina sticks out like a sore thumb! She's not funny at all!!
Cool trailer but that looks like the entire movie.
I love Nicholas Cage. I wanna watch it
yawn
"I'M A VAMPIRE! I'M A VAMPIRE!" - Nick
Not that annoying girl from Shang Chi 😖😖😖😖😖 her voice and acting is like chalk screeching on a board
awesome
ABOUT DAMN TIME! I loved home in Vampire Kiss!!!!! ABOUT DAMN TIME!!!! The world needs another Nicholas Cage vampire film!!!!!
I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!
I want to see Nic Cage god slap
Still waiting for Dracula untold 2
Freaking amazing!
What a dumb looking movie. No thanks
But Nicholas Hoult is greatly underestimated, because he perfectly gets used to his roles.
Let's see.......firearms, but......I don't see Alec Baldwin.........ok, we can relax and everyone is alive.
This … looks fun. Can’t wait to watch.
I don’t like the look of that at all
Nick cage as Dracula!! Best Ever decision
its gona be fun
Trash
🤩
Plz India 🙏 relllese on hindi...plz
I’m still waiting for him to play Fu Manchu
Man that opening joke was lame
😂 looks like utter shite
This actually... looks good?
It's Raising Arizona with a Dracula flavor.
I have such high hopes for this movie I hope it’s as good as it looks :)
Nicholas Hoult is so Gerard Way “ish” lol
Nicolas Cage: "I'll be playing Dracula." Bela Lugosi: "That's funny!"
.......is this a joke?
lol thanks, i just saw the whole movie ... really don't get these trailers, showing every high point in the movie ... such a spoil :(
Ugh awkwafina. I understand though, they wanted to balance out cage's dramatic and lively performance with something dull and boring.
This universe was already good without nicholas cage as vampire. What were they thinking!?
Wha - did they get Nicolas Cage to play dracula???? 😭😭😭😭
Ive just realized something. You know trailer starts out with in a classic normal movie trailer manner, and then you spot the asian chic whos the diversity character and i rolled my eyes knowing oooh here we go, they had to force diversity. This makes me feel like im racist, which i may be...but WHY? Because forcing-the-diversity cliché is triggering me! Ergo hollywood is creating racism rather than pushing it back! Now, its not a realization, i know this might be happening on purpose. Bite my theory. You know at this point forcing diversity IS the racist thing to do, makes me mad. Had to type it down, sorry not sorry.
Awesome
This movie got me hyped up 🤩
I’m a creeeeep I’m a weirdoooo what the hell am i doing here man i love this song
I hope it does not have that mutch meta comedy in it.
There's some absolutely spot on casting going on here, and not just the obvious one of Nic Cage as Dracula
I have a simple rule, if Nick Cage is in a movie you have to see it no matter how bad it may be
Nickey boys movies are hit or miss but I love his work. This looks great.
I heard if you say Nicolas Cage in the mirror 3 times he appears in his Dracula costume… 4 times and he shows up as Castor Troy with John Travolta’s voice.
Is this movie set in America?
Is this Morbius 2.0?
She always gets shocked by her male friends revelations. Dracula's assistance and  the gentleman from Shang-Chi. I would have to do security clearance on all my new friends 😂
It looked interesting until all the self help mantra nonsense ... sigh.
I hope in 20 years we're all stoked to see how the ninth and final chapter of the Renfield saga ends.
Looks good but nic cage looks like he usually does...an absolute idiot who can't act
Nick Cage looks as boring as ever, shame hes in the movie, could have been decent...
Its going to be disastrous ❤
What sucks is that you can tell, this is not going to be a good movie....maybe I'm wrong, I hope that I'm wrong.  As long as it doesn't have some crazy activism, it should be ok.....Fingers crossed, can't trust Hollywood anymore unfortunately.
Long Live Nic Cage !!
UNLEASH THE 😅CAGE
Dracula practically invented the title "The Most Narcissistic and Vainest Boss". Nic Cage playing the most iconic and favorite villain of all time. Reinfield saying "I deserve happiness", really hits hard, especially to every worker or anyone who is abused by their own bosses.
We are so lucky to have Nicolas Cage on this planet and in this timeline
Ooooo! Nicholas Cage as Dracula?!?  I’m ashamed that I did not think of that before
Catholicphobic. Cancelled.
Finally a fun, goofy movie that universal oictures is known for
Finally, a movie in which Nicolas Cage plays Marilyn Manson
Hell yeah
When I first heard about this I expected a dumpster fire. This actually looks like a fun movie!
What's the name of the Song playing
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
You guys think its cool to rip on other religions? How "tolerant" of you.
I'm a vampire, I'm a vampire, I'm a vampire, I'm a vampire!
The song itself is okay, but it feels out of place for this movie's trailer
Cage as Dracula seems awesome. The rest of the movie. not so much.
high hopes for Cage but... this looks like a shameless knock-off of What We Do In The Shadows.  except now it's copaganda.
Or course Nicolas Cage is playing Dracula.
Renfield vs Morbius, who will win?
Music name please.
I feel like I just watched the whole movie
Nick Cage is indeed a National Treasure.
Cage has overdone things to the point that its become more embarrassing than funny.
bagofshite
Oh the actors the music the plot it's the most interesting looking movie ever
Dracula might be Biting someone's face off in this movie.
CONGRATULATIONS ON DESTROYING A MOVIE BEFORE IT EVEN PREMIERES!!! NICHOLAS CAGE WAS A HORRIBLE CHOICE.
Yea. Ah...No.  Just, NO!
this looks sooooooo awful.  thank you leftist writers for more trash
I play creep on the average day this is so dope
That's crazy this movie is deja Vu or sum I love it already!
Dracula gave him superpowers, the bloody ingrate.
"FAIL!" "THIS IS LIKE SELLING YOUR SOUL THE SATAN OR THE ANTICHRIST!" "I AM NOT GOING TO WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
Aqwafina and Nicholas cage; a double no-thanks for this. Double the lack of talent. Another trash Dracula adaptation. I’d rather watch Morbius.
Final trailer?  Thank god.   Get it over with already
The Soundtrack, though... Give me chills...
What in the 🐂 💩 is this mess?!!!!
Looks like a fun movie, we need fun.
Ben Schwartz has seen (and was) blue, now he's seeing red.
A great spin on a subject that has been covered in many movies. Can’t wait to see it!
Would be a good movie if the Woke Shit was not in it Fail
Always gonna have that asian with the annoying voice as representation
So we are doing trailers that spoil the whole movie again?  😐
Master! Master! I mean... Mister! Mister!
He doesn't age only he has time in a cage😂😂😂
Without Nic Cage and the context, I would've thought this is some weird spin off to Warm Bodies
Nicholas Cage finally gets a role suited to his capability as an actor.
Gonna make Bella Lagousi proud!
Ciao Universal Pictures Italia il tuo video trailer mi è piaciuto tantissimo e non vedo l'ora di vedere in un prossimo video trailer Grazie a presto!!!!
Really, in the morass of a diminishing quality of superhero films and other franchise properties, this seems sort of refreshing despite it being another Dracula movie. With how preachy and niche Hollywood has become recently, I just want to go to a theatre and watch a nice, light, and easy-going flick with an absurd premise. Whomever thought to themselves "you know, Nic Cage would be a great Dracula" was a genius. Hoult and Awkwafina also seem to be really engaged in this movie, and that's a massive plus. I hate watching movies where the cast seems bored and detached. All seem to be hamming it up, and I couldn't be happier.
I’m sorry but how y’all going to set a whole moving here in New Orleans and y’all don’t have no damn black leads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUB-wjXUREE
For god sakes stop casting aquafina, shes not an actress, she can't act holy ma molly
Anything with Nick! I WATCH!! (No matter how fucked the story is. Im watching AH PERFORMER!)
It looks good , except in case you forgot it was 2023, here’s Akwafina in the cast for no good reason to be snarky
why there’s no black people! this is racist movie for Allah sake!
Vampire Nico is better that Ghost Nico.
❤❤❤
The most elaborate 2 week notice
I thought Awkwafina was cancelled because she insulted sacred black culture by saying "yo" or whatever?
This trailer was honestly so much better than the first one. I hope the movie is more in line with this trailer.
2:08 glad to see feminist comedy levels of humor isn’t going anywhere. It’s not even a joke. Hard pass. Hollywood is dead
Beast vs Dracula I'm down!
Please, please tell me you took that "Nick Cage is a vampire" meme and framed it somewhere in the background of this movie.
This is great, ha ha. Cage was lambasted for his portrayal of a vampire in the 80's but the role became a cult favorite. To see him "vamping it up" again, all these years later is both sweetly ironic and sweetly vengeful. I can't wait.
Why did they have to put that woman in here...
The only bad thing with this is that Asian womanbeing casted, no offense. She is soooo bad at everything.
I already forgot about this abomination. I thought it was over…
Cage looks fuxking awesome !!!  I hope the movie is as good as his makeup !!!
Cómo siempre impecable la actuación del Ghost Raider
this is just perfect.  Nicolas Gage being Dracula has got to be the best casting ever.
The memes that will come from this movie!
People are saying this movie looks good as if they didn’t just see Awkwafina and realize it’s just gonna be her corny jokes the whole movie😂😂
❤
Better than Twilight.
More trash this April
One of these days they will make a movie where the Christian is the good guy.
Whoever decided to make Nic Cage Dracula is a freakin genius.
im legit kinda psyched for this
Perfect tune radiohead creep.
lol in the past dracula handsome and renfield ugly... what happened here
aaaand we've pretty much seen the whole movie in that trailer lol.
Fan fact: Nicholas cage didn't know that he was filming he just doing what he does every day
haha  looks like its going to be fun!
Cool Castle I wonder where that is 🤔, must be Transylvania right?
Hate how everything is a cheesy action movie now. This sucks
Funniest dracula BY FAR
I will not see it because if I hear that womans annoying unfunny voice anymore I'll throw my child through the screen. Anyone but her.
What the song that used in the trailer?
What a douche, he was given the option to not take the job and he took it anyway. So hard to find decent help anymore
Looks boring and cliche
This looks so cheap. It is a thing to make movies look bad and cheap recently? It looks like B production and this is probably the best parts of the movie they pulled together.
This looks like ass....
Welcome To Nicholas *Fuuuuuuuccccccccccking* Cage Universe
This looks awesome
So since when is 90 years the same as "centuries"?
LOVE Nicolas Cage and really enjoyed watching Nicholas Hoult in "Warm Bodies."  I'm looking forward to seeing this movie!
Isnt this plot just what we do in the shadow rip off?
Nicolas Cage needs to put some bank away and just retire.
Seinfeld....
Can't wait! I hope it's as fun as it looks!
Why Awkwfina tho😅
This should have been a comedy with dracula as the protagonist, allowed Nick cage to go full crazy! Not a story around another side.
So Nicholas Cage is playing Nicholas Cage?
I am going to relish this!
looks like another disaster movie
working for Dracula 😂 and he is like "meah.. its a living" 🤣
Nicholas Hoult looks the same as when he played a zombie in Warm Bodies.  Nicholas Hoult está com a mesma aparência de quando ele fez um Zumbi, em Meu Namorado Zumbi.
Couldn't even finish the trailer it looks so bad. Sometimes when you try so hard to be tongue in cheek bad it really is bad.
from Dracula killer to become Dracula, Batman movie dialogue about "if you live long enough...." is soo true 🤣
There is an older Nicholls Cage movie of him playing a delusional guy that thinks he's a vampire. It had to be one of the funniest movies of his I ever watched. If this is anything like that older movie I certainly will be buying it..
some people really do deserve their job because casting Nicholas Cage was genius! 😂😂
This film would be 👌 if Awkwafina wasn't in it. She's just awful.
Looks like Bela Lugosi?
The movie about toxic worker and employer relationships?  Neat.
I actually feel like I just watched everything this movie has to offer in 2 minutes, I know the whole story the origin, the story, and the ending. I really dont even need to sit and watch it, I essentially just did. Everything else is just going to be as hollow as Nick Cage.
ayy that's count Cage
Usually any movie Nicolas Cage is in, is going to be good one.
Why do I feel like Nicholas cage in vampire kiss movie?
What a great scene from Nicholas Cage and wonderful fight from him. Awkwafina? How can she comeback from Shang-Chi with Simu Liu. Hope this is gonna be fun
I love all Nicholas cages movies. To me hes still an underated actor
Definitely gonna watch this.
TFW a major movie monster franchise (Dracula) rips off a hit show (What We Do in the Shadows) which was itself inspired by that same franchise. Some kind of pop culture Ourobouros, I think. 🤔
This movie is going to suffer from NOT ENOUGH CAGE lol.
Me: Only watching because akwafina is innit 🤩
Katy Chen, Beast, and Ghost Rider in one frame
this is a comedy?
💣💥💢
Ce plm e asta?
this is cringy 😬
Song title?
I love the look of this.
This film is going to bomb so bad.
Amazing Radiohead !!! Great Nicolas ! I will definitely be there, I will definitely see it !
"I'M  A VAMPIRE , I'M  A VAMPIRE , I'M  A VAMPIRE , I'M  A VAMPIRE !"
Satanic stuff are everywhere in west
It was a role that King Nick was destined to play 😃👍
He,s the New James Bond …. You heard it here first 😊
THIS LOOKS CGEAP
So this is Renfield when he being woke aka SJW.
Looks kinda fun 😊
Awkwafina cannot act
I think he finally realized that he is indeed a Vampire
If Akwafina wasn't in it I might watch it... Too bad.
We finally get a sequel to the critically acclaimed Vampire's Kiss
Comment section: Nicolas Cage! Other actors:  Just like it should be
Dunno about the comic relief tho
Nocolas Cage should have his own streaming service
Awkwafina was a bad choice for this.
Looked good until I saw Awkfina in it. She is a terrible actress and has the most annoying voice ever. Shang Chi was crap, but she made it 10x worse.
You had me at Radiohead.
Once upon a time Nicolas became a Vampire and it was a masterpiece, after a long time he is back and now he is the Dracula, Enjoy
I am enough, I deserve happiness and I take full charge of my life today.
Thanks for showing us the entire movie.
I like how the gore is kind of a mortal kombat style
This looks really fun, but I feel they showed way too much in this trailer.
Must everything be a Comedy
Another trailer showing off basically the entire film guess I don’t need to watch it now 😂
Both Nicolas had worked together before. It is great to see them again on screen.
I think they had to go with a comedy or else it would seem absurd, because Nicholas Cage can't play as Dracula without being over the top.
Oh for fucks sake, a movie about a monsters assistant that has fucking feelings. This generation is soft AF.
Sorry won't be watching....another satanist stuff from Hollywood and Globalists into our throats....wake up guys.
More Cage Garbage. 😂 Never more then a B list actor at best.
it's renfielding time
I love how this isn’t just a vampire flick. It a funny message for those who hate a job to get tf out lol. Can’t wait for this one looks funny.
its like RDJ for iron man and NC as dracula. 👌
Finally Nicolas Cage play in Dracula 🧛‍♂️ and Nicholas Hoult is Renfield plus amazing casts too 👍👍👍👍 Can’t wait to see it 🧛‍♂️👍🧛‍♂️👍🧛‍♂️
he's a vampire he's a vampire he's a vampire he's a vampire!!
Looks like they should have just gotten Nic to cameo in What We Do In The Shadows. That's about as far as this gimick has legs. Cage looks great, all else looks ass.
PASS. Enough anti-Christian bias from PedoHollywood.  You don't get my money.
i want to look forward to this. But the dialogue gave me twitter tending teen drama vibes. i'll just wait for the audience score.
I really hope these non-woke style movies catch on, this looks amazing. Actual entertainment. This and Cocaine Bear give me hope.
Cool, we dont get enough movies with nick cage wearing a cape. He's devouring scenary.
Nicholas Hoult embraces this kind of role, it's so iconic for him to be inhuman. I want to see him become human in Warm Bodies.
I'm tired of seeing forced Chinese faces, and unattractive faces that Holt guy
2:06 nice
Pass.
That is one unattractive Asian woman… woke movie. No thanks!
This looks amazing
I thought he's a vampire in real life also
Very happy that they're finally making a sequel to Seinfeld
So what’s the point of watching the movie after the trailer spoiled 85% of it…
Yeah Nic!!!
God why did they have to put Akwafina in it she is insufferable
The funniest part of this is that Cage actually looks a lot like Bela Lugosi in the costume.
I can see this being very memeble
The face he makes after the Pope says "The Catholic Church" is gold
Can't wait.....!
that shot of him going out the window /decapitating the guy/waving was too good to waste in the trailer - still not as bad as 'Smile' blowing its load with the neck-twist car window shot lol
Nicolas Cage has always dreamt of playing Dracula. This is his dream come true.  Can't wait for him to go crazy in this movie. "THE BEES, NOT THE BEES!"
I feel that after Face-off some Travolta will forever be inside Cage
Watching this makes me wish they made a Dracula Untold sequel.
From a nut who thought he was vampire in one movie to this…  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PnoSxO_2ghQ
Well I am going to watch
Whoever made this trailer needs to be demoted. I know the whole story. Why would I go to the theaters
Idk why no one is saying this. Nicholas choosing Nicholas is it's assistant is epic
Dumb ass movies these days I tell ya
I wonder who greenlit this fukin film
W9w
Garbage!
just don't kill Nichols Cage in this, mmhm K?
Are kids srill interested in these rehashed cinematographic vomits honestly.
he will say blah bla blah eventually
We went from seeing Nicolas Hoult being a zombie that falls in love in Warm Bodies, to seeing him being Dracula's servant in Renfield.
he is the most versatile actor of his time and also it's finally good to see more Asians in the movies.
Not sure
Cage as Dracula - check. Now, can we get Dafoe as Joker, were done. ;)
Movies these days are just downright horrible.
I'm Morbing out over here.
Nicolas Cage in his final form, I'm just glad I'm alive to see it
Imagine a Frankenstein Monster movie starring with Frankenstein’s Monster and Igor but the villain is Dr Frankenstein
This sequel to Vampires Kiss looks dope
This movie is what i need right now
Vlad Tepes could not have played the role better
Nicolas Cage is fully embracing his meme-hood now
bro thinks he is gizmo
I need an exact search term to find this version of Creep (the background song).
Yeah man looking goooood 👏👏👏
Gonna be a good week for movies, Super Mario Apr 7 then Renfield Apr 14. Nice.
Part of me wants to see this and get a few good laughs in. But also, part of me wants to take a baseball bat to the genitals of whoever made those fangs and the werewolf fursuits. Repeatedly.
The definition of a trailer should not be movie recap.
Nicolas cage playing Dracula looks pretty cool and funny playing count Dracula  the legendary vampire in renfield looks like a great horror comedy coming in April in USA  and Europe and Australia may 25th could be Nicolas cage best movie ever playing Dracula in renfield
Film good
Police lady are rush hour little girl 😮😮😮
I love trailers that shows 80% of the movie, including all the plot points. Marvelous.
Why does Dracula have an English accent when he's actually Romanian?
Why Nicolas look like the food critic from Ratatouille
I can't wait to watch this movie looks horror and comedy^^!  two NIck  together, this is  perfect  2 of my favorite actor.
Point of the movie, give workers vacation, better pay, and appreciation
This turd isn't even out yet? I thought it already bombed and disappeared.
Well it took a while but it finally happened nic cage is a vampire between this and evil dead rise April is gonna be a great month for horror
.
Didnt expect this .....
Didnt expect this movie .....
Didnt expect .....
Didnt expect ....
Didnt expect
Unbelievable
Cooooolllllll
GOD IM SO THRILLED I CANT WQAIT
The cage is caging again. You thought a movie about the cage played by the cage would be too much cage. But no, the cage has no limit. The cage will try to cage the cage to cage the cage inside the cage, but the cage will break the cage to keep cage caging as long the cage remains the cage with the cage. There's no stopping the cage from caging away to those who support the cage and the ways of caging. The cage must cage, to prevent the cage from being caged, being the cage we love because he is the cage.
Istg creep never dies bruh it is an immortal song
So you guys just gonna show whole movie in the fucking trailer like that
Please be good, please be good, please be good!!!!?!🧛‍♂🤞
Best cast for Dracula ever
Can't wait until this comes to streaming!
Robin Williams can play Nosferatu.
No wonder the guy playing Reinfeild looks very familiar, he’s the Beast from X-Men and he’s Jack the Giant Slayer! 😅
Cage is finally a vampire. Wow.
Jake Peralta on Nic Cage as Dracula: Told you the guy has range!!
Damn, for a moment i thoght  better this posh
Nicholas Hoult is the name of the young man portraying the character, Renfield.
Everyone saying Nicolas Cage as a vampire is amazing are missing the point -- Nicolas Cage as a "   " is amazing. That's it.
This looks legitimately great!
really wish they pull this off.
That lens is gonna make people motion sick
First zombie now vampire....when he's gonna do the werewolf?
Why would they put aquafina in this film. Looked good until she showed up. Hopefully she doesn't kill the movie for me like she did with shang chi.
Is it just me or were there alot of spoilers in the trailer?
Looking like Marilyn Manson
The world needs more Nic Cage movies..
Finally the real dracula
Finally a movie I'm excited about in 2023
Hope Nicholas Cage keeps going! He is fun to watch and deserves more films before hanging it up!
Nic Cage was a great pick to play Dracula. If not for him, I probably wouldn't give this movie a second look. Other than him, it looks very generic, been there-done that.
ENTIRE PLOTE WAS GIVEN IN THE TRAILER..wow..  No need to see the movie !! Thanks
This looks so f’king incredible! I absolutely must see this. Brilliant casting, brilliant choice of music, brilliant script and dialogue. This will be my favorite movie of the year.
It's nice to finally see Nicholas Cage play a role other than Nicholas Cage. I've always thought that he was a very bad actor,...but finally a Cage role worth watching. I'm sure he will still have his flavor of cheese, but his bad acting may actually work here.
im here for nicolas cage. I hope many memes come from this movie.
I deserve to be happy.
Nick cage finally becomes what he always wanted. A vampire
Nic Cage isn't playing Dracula. Have you ever seen him get any older? That's what I thought! 😁
Thought I would hate this... but it looks really good!
#cage_niveau💩
Die Chinafresse macht den Film zum Müll!! ABER die Hollywood_Regel,holl eine kack Fresse um es zu versauen!!
This is my way awesome
Marilyn Manson vibes
Awkwafina still hasn't gotten out of her Katy character from Shang chi and Nicholas Hoult is...the Beast !!
They got the orange Dodge Challenger 👀
A movie that shouldn’t contain a ton of cgi will contain a ton of cgi…..real movies are dead
"Oh, God bless you, nuns!"   That delivery sold me on this lol.
I think it has a solid premise, may actually see it.
wow, he finally DID become a vampire
Universal finally start to do good (hopefully) with their Monsters franchise
Dracula as Nicholas cage
I want watch this now
I want to fucking see this, love me some Nick cage movies.
It's a massive introduction
A good idea, but I think the action and bad comedy is really gonna pull down the film. I'm thinking if they pulled back on both and made it a good dark comedy it would be great.
Cashing in on wwdits success..
Aquafina Ping as usual so China is satisfied.
Welp no point in watching the movie got the whole plot spoiled.
Бессмертный Коля Клеткин это что-то! Уже хочу увидеть сие творение
Creep is a nice touch
Waiting on a killer werewolf film now
Why cage looking like the joker on some facial expressions?
Gonna FLOP
This just looks ridiculous.
Nicolas Cage as a dracula was written at very early stage when he laughed wickedly in the movies🔥😆
Nicolas Cage is an National Treasure.
Nicholas Cage looks like a real life dracula version from Hotel Transylvania…
Why her
From wannabe vamp in Vampire's Kiss to full-on Dracula in Renfield.
Lots of bot accounts saying nick cage is a great casting choice for dracula…I cant tell if this is a comedy movie? action or a lgbt movie? Cant wait for the pitch meetings to tear this one apart 😂
Oh man, watching this makes me miss Christopher Lee so much
looks fucking awful
Looks absolutely horrible
Nick needs to use the slap of devil in this one
Where's guillermo?? Nadia, lazlow or even nandor
I'd watch it...
British Morbius
"I deserve good things. I am entitled to my share of happiness. I refuse to beat myself up. I am an attractive person. I am fun to be with."  - Stuart Smalley
This IS a movie of all time!
I’m gonna be honest I’m probably just gonna watch it cus Nicolas Cage is in it 😂I’m not really into movies like this but he and the others have shown pretty good performances in their other works makes me wanna watch
When I was a boy, I thought Renfield must've been incredibly stupid to worship Dracula so much even when his guilt eating him away. And then, I grew up.......
Dracu-later hater 😏
Vampires Kiss comes full circle i am so fuckin excited for this movie
Nick Cage as Dracula is weirdly fitting
Ugh. If only Aquafina wasn't in this...
I am going to enjoy this one and watch it solely for entertainment.  I won't read what the critics or some 🍅 have to say about it.
When Nicolas Cage got the part for this movie, he ran down the street screaming, “I’M A VAMPIRE! I’M A VAMPIRE!”
This movie is so woke you won't be able to sleep a whole month.
Oh snap 😂 as soon as I saw the thumbnail I gave the video a thumbs up never in my life have I ever done that
This has Worm Bodies vibe
it's like that episode from Inside Job where all ageless actors from Hollywood are actually vampires
No.
I can't wait, this movie looks so entertaining! It may be the next EEAAO, js lol.
Would have been cool if they made Dracula a hero, I don't want to see him die
Radiohead,creep..miss this song
Crazy how much the Catholic church is criticized but never Islam.
So he's become a wolfman, a Zombie and now a vampire?
Such a novel and hilarious take on this centuries old story. Nic as Drac, Nicholas as Renfield and goddamn Awkwafina! This is gonna be fucking silly fun!
I am just here to see Nic Cage...
Nick going brazy
So boring.  I'm so glad I started writing my own entertainment.  I don't know how people can stand this imitation sugar media.
All of the best parts of the film in ONE phat trailer!
Looks like they made an actual entertaining movie this time. But don't hold your breath. The preview is sometimes better than the movie. We'll see.
I get the whole token ethnicity character thing, but why do movie execs keep making it Awkwafina? She's one of the ugliest Asian women I've ever seen. Her voice is straight up audible torture. But she hits casting check marks on asian, woman, musician, and casting execs are like perfect??? I bet they started to alternate her music with Eminem's on a loop in the CIA black sites. I mean, you can only use solid Eminem loops for clandestine torture for like 20 years right?
So uh, where can I get this version of Creep?  Just asking.
Finally Nicholas Cage get his wish to play the role of a real vampire, instead of just pretending to be one. 😂😂
why do these movie execs keep shoe-horning Awkwafina into everything? she literally has only one good movie ffs.
The most trusted institution on Earth...yeah...right...
lost any/all interest once in watching this akwafina came on screen.
that asian lady sticks out like a sore thumb
Yes please!
Wow love interests used to be good looking. Guess we gotta get used to shlubby people the worse the obesity gets.
Looks eh
Nic Cage: being Dracula in this film…IT FELT NATURAL…like the smooth texture of a well ripened banana still in its peel.
The resurrection of Dracula.... Sorry Nicolas Cage👍👍👍👍👍
The movie looks like it does not take itself too seriously and is fun and does not have the woke message going - hoepfully people have a good time and NIcolas Cage gets his due. Look forward to this one.
Nah
Seeing an Asian gal like Awkwafina just stand there dumbfounded amidst all the CGI just makes it so real. Can't wait to see this.
so much potential and it will be dog ....
We all need so badly for this to be good.
This is just DUMB
Oppenheimer stream has been going for 7 months stop the stream already
From ghost rider to Dracula. I'm thinking that words "you only deserve suffering" is to his ghost rider character.
I hope they won't ruin this movie with some woke crap...
Please don’t tell me one of my favorite actors Nicolas Cage dies in this? Noooo… and isn’t that the guy from the zombie movie that came back to being human? Can’t wait to watch this shit!
This looks awful. I hate to say it. Lame humor, awful costumes, bad storyline.
Renfield’s had enough of Dracula’s shit
Its Renfielding time
Awkwafina is using all three of her facial expressions to let you know when she's saying something funny. This is going to be great.
I won’t lie, ‘I deserve to be happy’ is actually a really good theme for a movie and for some reason it’s not one that’s used that often
Whoever decided to make Nic Cage Dracula is a freakin genius.
Using such a classic song for such a stupid movie should be illegal.
Goofy
WHO'S DRACULA? NICOLAS CAGE? OR MARILYN MANSON? 🤨🤨
Nic cage has played almost every character possible by this point.
Can that dude play anything that's alive?
This looks Amazing!
I’m a simple man, I see Awkwafina, I leave a dislike.
Umm.... no.
Is this morbius 2.0?
Mmm hmm….some SERIOUS talent in this one.
Every time i see Aquafina Im always amazed on how big her face keeps getting. Like when is she gonna run out of room?
This reminds me of “Dracula dead and loving it” with Leslie Nielsen 😊
if only Awkwafina wasnt in this...
Can’t wait let’s go ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
I’m so amped to watch this
PERFECT VEHICLE FOR CAGE!   He can NickCage ALL OVER THE PLACE and when everything's just dripping in NickCage, you'll throw up your hands and say, THAT'S MY DRACULA!  IT'S MORBIN' TIME!🦇😅🤣😂
Fail. Giant fail. Hollywood needs to get its originality back.
So excited for this for so many reasons!
I'm in. Take my money.
MORBIUS 2😢🥶💯😭🇦🇹
Nicolas cage and radio head ?! YESSS
this looks really good but if awkwafina is in it i won't be watching her voice is annoying and she ruined the 10 rings
Suck. The classic vampire theme that of course gets a hard spin to the left, then dipped in cheese and deep fried. I dont think I could name two good movies Cage was in. The costumes look pretty good tho...
Nicolas Cage has come full circle from Vampire's Kiss to now. Not sure how I feel about this movie, but I might just see it for NC as Dracula.
This looks really good actually
Nicholas Cage getting a bit of a comeback lately.  Can't say I hate the idea.
I went to see 65 with my grandpa and we both audibly laughed when Nick Cage came on screen. Also using Creep was pretty cool
Better morbius
Cage was BORN to play this role!!! 😂
If Dracula doesn't have his three brides, IT AIN'T A DRACULA MOVIE. WOKE be damned.
❤❤❤can't freaking wait!!
Great! They can actually remake the live action of Hotel Transylvania 😂
How come that chick always plays the cringe comedic side kick that isn't funny?
looks like a shitty movie and how/why does music from Radio Head mesh with this? 🤨
Nicolas Cage finally showing his real story 🤣 we all know your a vampire Nicolas Cage 🤣
As if I wasn't sold on this movie already
Creo estará muy buena la película con Nicolás  De 🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇
When I saw the title, for a split second was almost thinking a movie remake of Seinfeld staring Nicolas Cage with a different name
Literally Nichols Cage is my actor😂 this dude is a Legend
Nicolas finally getting good film again...
This is just as chaotic as it needs to be
This is what morbius should have been in the first place
I have been so excited for this movie. And then I found out awkwafina was in it...
I have no idea if this is going to be good or not. usually I can tell from a trailer but not this one. Could be total garbage, or the best action comedy of the year.
Ah yes, the long-awaited Vampire's Kiss sequel
from zombie to dracula, cool
Awesome
So In other universe Ghost Rider and Zombie are Team up?
A Marilyn Manson movie starring Nick Cage.
Wait why does this look rlly good
Finally trailer? As if we didn't get the gist of the movie from the first trailer
Creep instrumental
Finally, a Cage film that gets the dreams
An over the top comic character is the character nicholas cage has played his whole career only this time its intentional.
Looks like shit
I will glady watch it based on the fact that there isnt a million black people in it being forced upon us with the liberals black supremacist agenda!!!
This looks like a comedy 😁  ….. can’t wait
Who runs Hollywood? No wonder all the catholic church hate in trailer. That's how we get bigoted garbage like this trailer. Hope this movie tanks.
nicholas cage looks horrible. his dramaticness is cringe as fuck
Nicholas Cage looks like Marilyn Manson. We’re all star’s now….in the dope show. 😂
Aquafina and ol' weird Nic.  Perfect.
Oh yesss
Nice Cage looks more like late Sir Christopher Lee than Nic Cage un Dracula law.
Looks hilarious awesome 😎.
wow! that looks good 🙄
Saint Nicolas, the Cage.
Who keeps putting Aquafina in stuff? Stop it.
I just really don't like that actor named after cokes bottles water, she is not funny or talented.  Sorry I'm going to miss this too.
This trailer made me wanna be on Dracula's side. Can he kill Renfield and his sidekick horribly please?
When will they stop casting Awkwafina. She is honestly one of the worst actresses working today
he always play pale characters lol
I just feel like this trailer has more spoiler parts, that actually should.
This looks like a solid 6/10 movie. A fun enough film with some ok action scenes but it looks like it lacks the ambition to aim higher.
cant wait to see this nick cage is amazing and in this role is gonna be great!!!!
Did anyone watch "Pig"?  Nicholas was wonderful in that movie!!
Seems cute. Should be fun!
Awesome
This looks so much fun! I hope the gore doesn’t look too cartoony in the actual film  This role suits Nicholas Cage so well
i remember nic hoult did something somewhat similar to this film called warm bodies. i enjoyed that film a lot.
Hard pass on a theme that been made 1000 times. Nexus let try and be original.
En Efecto, Esto es Cine.
I'm so looking forward to this one.  I love it when Nicholas Cage is allowed to go full Nic Cage.
The Nick Cage comeback continues ❤❤
Ah good ol Nic Cage being the actor that he is, you gotta love him.
I remember the Renfield from Dracula: Dead and Loving It by Mel Brooks where 1.) He also eat insects while having conversation with Dr Seward 2.)Peeping on Mrs. Lucy while she's sleeping,  3.) Accidentally burned and killed Dracula while attempting to help him escape 4.)After Dracula is dead, he calls Dr. Seward his new master
Don't​ be​ Another​ woke​ please​
HOLY SHIT WATCHING THE 30 sec TRAILER ON TV made me think damn the generation we're in is just sad af.  Nick the Clown cage has never looked so  worn out for a role.  Hey nick no when to say no
What's the song in the trailer? It sounds familiar.
Cage could play a stop sign at the corner of the most boring block on Earth . . . I still watch that movie.
Can’t wait for Cage to show up on What We Do in the Shadows— he’s official now 😂😂
I'll watch this twice😂
They ruined it w the Chinese chick as a sidekick.  I already know everything she’s gonna say.  She could be the 5th ghostbuster in ghostbuster 2016.
I love that song, I love Nic Cage,  I LOVE Nicolas Hoult, and I love Awkwafina
Great uses of radiohead creep
Don’t read the description
This looks like trash. Can’t wait for Red Letter Media to do their thing with it.
This look AWESOME!
I usually prefer werewolf movies to vampire ones, but this looks like FUN!!
Not going to watch Hollywood pedophiles
There's only one asian actress in hollywood
I'm not really a fan of bashing religions... but I am a fan of Nicholas Cage and him as Dracula is pretty hard to pass up even if the rest of the movie sucks. I think it'll be worth the watch.
I love campy movies this looks so fun.
“I’m a vampire … I’m a vampire” - N.C🧛‍♂️ dreams do come true
This looks terrible
Smash
❤❤❤Nicholas Cage Movies❤❤❤
Gotta see this ❤️ Cage
Renfields love interest. Yah right!🤮
Looks horrible.... so bad it might be good if I get stoned
0:09 this made me laugh so much. Is this a comedy
Lol Cage finally has that crazy look going to good use 😂🤣
it looks so good...
The rare occurrence of Nic Hoult starring a film with his natural accent haha
I’m all about it but it does seem like a rip off of what we do in the shadows
You mean Red Fall🤭💉🩸🦷
I hope there is "you dont say" meme reference in this movie
cant wait to see cage interpretation of neo-impressionism
Nicolas Cage and Nicholas Hoult should be a good pairing
This looks stupid.
LAME !!!!!!
Man this movie looks dumb
Such concept, could be great, but even a comedy with Nick Cage can't save a story with self-help tones written by woke Hollywood.
This might actually be decent, and I like how they got the guy from "Warm Bodies".
Can't wait to watch it
Nicolas Cage Is the New Godfather of Horror
I honestly thought it was a trailer from @SpaceIce cant wait to hear him do it
Nicholas really good at this performance similar like his old movie as a zombie fallin in love with human, his face so suitable with zombie or vampire
Awkwafina can't act. How many more movies does he have to ruin before they stop casting this thing.
Looks good but they practically showed the whole movie.
Perfect casting. No other comment needed.
I can’t take Nick Cage serious anymore. Him and Bruce Willis have been grabbing at any B rated movie they can get their hands on.
Looks gay
Dracula""dead n loving it"""😂
Fcuk yes!
Nick looks amazing on this! And why do they keep hiring this woman, she's not funny.
Yeah I can’t take Nicholas Cage serious. Dude looks confused 24/7
Does anyone remember Leslie Neilson as dracula? look up 'dracula dead and loving it' . seeing this trailer made me think of that (although that was more slapsticky type comedy and this isn't)
Boring. Love Nicolas Cage tho.
NiCage... I love him over 20 years until now and still love him for ever...❤❤
Ooohhh maybe Halloween Horror Nights will do a Renfeild!
Does anyone know what performance of creep this is? I was thinking the live in japan show?
Cage lookin like Christopher Lee's Dracula a little bit
Waiting on "that's not like the book"
It's a vampire movie about NOTHING
I think they could have done better than Nicholas Cage
I’m gonna go to the theaters to see this
Shame it's not a Tarantino movie.
Nicholas Cage looks like he is having fun with this movie.
I love Nicholas Cage...He is a F-ing Nut!  lol
Keep saying that Nicholas Holt would be perfect for the next James Bond
I LOVE IT!! I have always LOVED😍 Nicholas Cage 🥰, I have every movie he has ever been in, and one of my Favorites is Vampires Kiss! so I am REALLY happy to see him do this...He Finally became that Vampire he swore he was 😄
Priest: you have the protection of the most trusted institution of the earth, the catholic church.  Renfield: 😒
“Put the bunny down”
Finally heard Radiohead in a movie lmao
Great I just watched the whole movie
I haven't seen a trailer for a single movie in years that I actually thought looked fun. This looks like fun. Glad to see Nick Cage once again.
FLOP
The Radiohead - Creep song makes this even more fun to want to watch!
Looks pretty fucking stupid, way to go
I am rooting for Dracula to win,
Nicholas Cage? Say no more.
Glad to see more of Nicholas Cage all of a sudden these days
Hell nah
This movie definitely will suck but we are still gonna watch it😅😅😅😅😅😅
Would be a really funny idea but too bad ‘what we do in the shadows’ did it already
Great casting.  Success will hinge on the direction, chemistry, and if the script actually is funny.
ABCD EFGHIJKLMNOPQRST UV WXYZ  If you know, you know.
Looks good, but man they should have a 60s limit on Trailers. I had to stop before I lost interest.
This looks so stupid. You had the opportunity to take a genuinely interesting character from the book and tell the Bram Stoker vision all from Renfield's perspective, but what did you do? Decide to make some goofball comedy set in modern day. Absolute fail.
Whoever Universal made in charge is such a goof in the best way possible. First Cocaine Bear and this. Ridiculous but it's been working out.
Renfield is a very interesting character, its cool that he is getting his own movie. Nic Cage as Dracula should be amazing also.
This is gonna be the cutest version of Dracula.
nicolas kage become part of ashikaga and join/sponsor us. we will be your best friends
Ben Schwartz is in it! Awesome! He was good in Sonic, Ducktales, and We Lost Our Human Interactive Netflix Specials. Nick Cage Playing Dracula Works.
Nick Cage, Awkwafina and Nicolas Hoult. This will be PERFECTION
I KNEW IT! I always said Nicholas Cage would be an awesome vampire!
This is out of the blue! I’m like okay 👌 I’m going to see it.
The movie looks surprisingly entertaining
Taylor's bullshiting his way, love it!
This story was completely stolen from someone else's short story.  Cage should be ashamed of himself.
I really wonder what that dislike count looks like.
This is a perfect example of why the newest movie in my blu ray collection is from 1993.
Now he can run down the street screaming "I'm a vampire, I'm a vampire!" and mean it - and I'm down for it.
So we just saw the movie via trailer.
Hell yes.
This reminds me of zero effect, movie about a meth head detective and his sidekick who wants to escape
radiohead is great
Nicolas Cage used to be such an awesome actor. What's happened to him?
Wack af
First Universal give us a good Invisible Man, now Renfield/Dracula. I wonder what they will do with Wolfman, Frank's Monster, and Gillman?🤔
Since noone else is going to point out the obvious, I will....this looks dumb as fuck😑
Nice to see Mr. Cage getting good work.
morbius 2 lookin crazy bro
Wasn’t he a friendly at one point of time
im watching it
Nicolas looks like Bela Lugosi in a way..can’t wait to see this..❤
🤭👎👎👎
I have a boss this reminds me of.
But renfeld was a loyal and faithful servant. Would never go against The Mastha!
This just straight up looks fun :^)
That asian bitch annoying, pass.
Omg i thought that was Adele in the thumbnail
Please give Nicky Cage 7 million to stay home or 7.1 to never try acting again
Nicholas Cage as Dracula. That'll be a hoot.
Im sure the movies me makes pay but theyre dumb af.
This looks great. Love how Nicholas looks, too. Dead on Dracula.
Someone please back me up here... I SWEAR I've heard that Catholic Church joke in another film. Recently too maybe(last 5 years)???
I can't wait to see this.
This looks awful !!  I like Nick Cage but he's a terrible choice for Dracula. It looks like a comedy.
Love the song!!!
Awkafina looks like she's not as over-the-top as she usually is. Of course, she's in a Nicolas Cage where that's _his_ thing, albeit he's not known for being overbearing and annoying. Too, Nicholas Hoult's performance looks to keep her usual schtick at bay as well and balance out Cage's.
Great concept, but Nick Cage?!?!?!
This looks a lot of fun!
Is this gonna be one of those movies where the main draw (Nicholas Cage in this instance) appears in all the marketing but only ends up having about 10 minutes of actual screen time?
Please, just one reference of "Vampire Kiss" with Nicolas screaming *I'm a Vampire!*
2:01 spoilers.
This looks incredible!!
please be fun. it LOOKS fun. pleasepleaseplease
what in the actual f*ck in this
And he said….he dont need to be in MCU…..aye
Nic Cage!!!!   "Karla was the Prom Queen."
Bruh hes teamed up with the creature from the black lagoon??? Oh wait, that's just golden globe nominated actress, rapper, and comedian awkwafina!
She is so irritating it's put me straight off watching this movie
Nope
I would watch Nic Cage sit in a room and eat flies for 2 hours.  OK, not really, but you know what I mean.
Radioheaaaaaaaaad lezzzz gooooooo
This looks entertaining, but whenever I see Nicholas Cage in something these days, I flash back to that old College Humor sketch: “I like being in movies, Gary.”
this is one of those movies where you know you will be either laughing with them or at them 😅
This looks ridiculous. I wanna see it omg omg omg
that's an interesting twist.
I feel like they showed way to much
Yes please. I'm in.
This trailer looks crazyyy
i bet cage is the only thing good about this movie ..... already looks like a bunch of propaganda crap -is this how we are going to normalize eating bugs
I can't believe they already remade Morbius
I guess the black-ccent is fine now for the "I-just-got-out-of-bed" faced Asian girl.
Peter Loew truly did turn into a vampire!
Badass
This will be great. I love Nick!
Nicholas Holt has already played zombie, and vampire. When will he play as werewo— oh, wait.
RADIOHEAD
Shockingly this is a sequel to 1931 movie Dracula pretty much been 92 years
Listen, this looks fun and all, but why the heck are we getting a Dracula story like this, and not an authentic adaptation of the source material???
It’s amazing that no one seems to see that Nicholas Cage as Dracula has a similar look to Christopher Lee’s Dracula.
Yah I’m good 💩
Hotel Transelvania Part 4 real Life....Lets go..!
Oh akwafina? No thanks then
I'm gonna love this so, so much.
"The most trusted institution in the world! The Catholic church!"  That made me laugh so hard, I feel like God is gonna smite me down to hell
Movies growing even more terrible. The plot is dumb
What's great is they have a fat Asian woman!
finally an accurate representation of the servile nature of democrats.  'you vil eat ze bugs!'
Ghost Rider
yes please
I see Nicholas Cage, I click.
It’s another movie that I didn’t know I wanted, CANNOT WAIT!!!!
Trailer's GOATED for using Creepy by Radiohead
I am Sold...
Finally a movie that can compete with Morbius
white people love the devil.
Has anyone in Hollywood spammed movies more than Cage? Good god. He’s an awful actor.
You should feel bad for this. It is a joke, it is an abomination, and it does nothing but fuck up a time honored classic. Dracula does not deserve this. First the terrible Netflix series, now this. Even "90 years later." The book took place in fucking 1897. They should be either in 1990 (at the latest) or 130 years later. You didn't even care enough to do the math right.   I hate everything and everyone to do with this, and everyone involved should feel bad. You should go to sleep knowing that you shit on a classic piece of Western literature, and you did it out of pure fucking creative laziness. You should be ashamed.
Nic looks like he had a lot of fun with this
I dont remember the actor name but isn't he last time in a movie which he is a zombie who is slowly become a human? Now he serve a dracula. Lol. Maybe next he become mummy or werewolf.
i saw the whole movie in the trailer . WELL DONE
Nick at Night   Anyone? Lol
Epic
I never knew I needed a Nic Cage Dracula in my life, but after I heard of it there was an emptyness that can only be filled by Nic Cage playing Dracula. A longing I've never known. lol
"You don't say"
Another sh!t Hollywood movie.
So Awkafina not using her Black act in this one?
I wonder what Thom thinks about the use of creep. I mean they must have approved it, but yeah. OTOH he does not care for creep much.
That would almost make me want to go to the cinema. But no. People are there.
I could live without the silly kung fu crap.
This I’m hyped for! Nicolas Cage as Dracula is what we’ve needed for years. I can’t wait to see this in theatres.
The White replacement agenda is super obvious. Are there any White couples in film anymore?
Disobey your master and fight this oppression
6 letters C R I N G E
Why is this immediately hilarious?...Oh yeah "Vampire's Kiss" so this is perfect. Makes sense in a way. We love you Mr Cage...and we're falling for you as well Mr Hoult and of course Awkwafina.
Nicolas Cage is, indeed, a vampire now.
Man.  Nick would make a damn good Joker.
I cant wait for this release!
anytime a trailer is longer than a minute - it’s a bad movie because they need to show half of the movies content because the story isn’t captivating enough
This looks lit I can’t wait til this comes out
Nicolas Cage, Nicholas Hoult, Awkwafina…this is going to be the coolest Dracula movie ever….💯🍿😍🧛🏻!!
Nick must have done his time in Hollywood purgatory bc he's back baby
naaa i pass
the great N.Cage like the graet Bela Lugosi.awesome
Nicolás Cage DRACULA = MARILYN MANSON
Ah. He's back as a vampire again...Good for you Nick.
I feel obligated to watch this movie~
Hollywood is a disease
Nick cage hasent  had a good character all decade
Dracula is like Renfield's toxic ex
I just love watching the entire movie in the trailer
Can they edit out that horrible Aqua-Brita-Dasani bitch from the movie, please??
slave white man gets saved by g00k WOMAN and her black friends, from white old man. HARD PASS on this trash
Awesome
This is one of those movies that people will forget right after seeing... 👍 for Nic Cage as dracula tho
Thanks for showing us the whole movie in this trailer.......
NICOLAS CAGE REMINDS ME OF BELA LUGOSI.
If Nicholas Cage is in it then it must be good, is usually the law of nature nowadays
Nicolas cage such a TERRIBLE ACTOR never liked any of his movies
Nic cage as Dracula looks like Christopher Lee
Awkwafina is what i got out of that trailer, holly shit, she's great.
That Mario Movie Tho I cant wait
1:27   when the beast become renfield. 😎
Damn that's hot shit.
Yeaaaah
What’s with everyone’s obsession with Nicholas Cage? It’s almost as if a couple people said Nicholas Cage is “cool” and everyone who lacks a personality follows…
Nic is back , bitches!
0:03: Neuschwanstein Castle. A classic.
Only reason to watch is cage literally chewing the scenery as Dracula the rest is ass
LOL, boy is Hollywood out of ideas, this looks awful!
why do trailers always completely give away the movie?
This looks so much better than all the flopping superhero movies! Can't wait!!!
I'm wagering the Nicolas Cage scenes will be campy and interesting to watch, but the rest looks awful
I can not wait to see this!
Vampire's Kiss update. I'm down.
Nicholas Cage as Dracula is laughable and pathetic, they should fire whoever greenlit this dumb decision. Remember when Cage wanted to play Superman? He wanted to play Superman so bad that he had publicity photos taken of him wearing the cape and a Superman hair-styled blue wig, omg so funny. 🤣
Dracula movie....so of course the female "love interest" is a fat Asian girl.    Cool "diversity".....
I'm there!
Interesting twist. Could have spared the Catholic Church references. Try Judaism or Islam for a change huh Hollywood?
I love Nick Cage.
He went full beast in that one clip
Nick in his natural habitat
So excited for this one!!!!!
This looks like a fun time.
From Dusk Till Dawn meets... Devil Wears Prada? Sure.
Ofc they used creep
finally, morbius 2
Nobody does batshit crazy like Nicolas Cage!!!😂
Nicolás Cage as Dracula is something I never knew I needed, but now I can’t live without it
Nicolas and Nicholas.
Finally a film to capture Nick Cages ott performances!!
Nicolas cage is gotta be one the worst actors I’ve ever seen 😂
This looks like a Schrödinger's movie right now. It could either be so bad that it's good, or it could just be bad- and we won't know which is true until we open the coffin.
This looks like a ton of fun
Lmao
Nic Cage going back to his vampiric roots. We saw him in Vampire's Kiss, and now this, what a time to be alive
Reminds me of marilyn  manson😅
Excited for this!!! 👍
SORRY...........LOOKS TOO COMICAL TO ME.
Certified hood classic
CRINGE AF
Кейдж-негодяй 😅
Like that more movies are coming out!!
Anyone else remember when trailers didn't spoil the entire movie plot? Yeah, me neither.
Warm Bodies 2
A younger Depp would have killed this role!
no one is watching this
I got to participate in a virtual audience test screening for this movie (see edit for details) a few months ago. It wasn’t the full movie, it was various scenes and we would rate how we enjoyed them, if we thought they were funny or not, etc. What I did see looked really fun and entertaining. It gave me a very “What We Do In The Shadows” type of vibe. I’m excited to see the full movie.   EDIT: I did NOT see the entire movie and I’m not trying to claim I have. The thing I participated in was about 30-45 mins including the survey; I would say I saw maybe 15 mins of the films, if that. It was done online and not in person. The purpose of my comment is to say I’m excited about the movie because I saw a small bit of it and I’m eager to see more.
2022.
Is this like Seinfeld lol
I love just about every movie .Nicholas Cage is in. But I'll sit this this one out, altogether. I don't like bloody, Gore, slash + trash films at all.  His "Snake eyes " and "Leaving Las Vegas" were Exceptionally Good award worthy movies and his acting was excellent. IMHO.
How do you get N.Cage to star in your film? You just ask him. I'm in.
Welp.... There it is.  You ruined it. Went from an interesting idea and concept to..  Oh no wait this is just a nother post-modernistic quipathon. I'll see this movie on the seven seas.
Aquafina, really? Gawd this could have been so much better if that bottled water wasn’t in this movie
Never thought Nicholas would make a good vampire.
Nicholas Cage + Morbius + Creep? Aight sure
Nicholas Cage as a vampire looks like Marilyn Manson back in the early 2000s
Universal Pictures: jumps on the Catholic bashing bandwagon Me: saves money for a worthy movie
Quick we need a minority women someone find Aquafina.
This looks great and Cage's Dracula looks incredible. Excited and glad Hoult is getting more roles in Hollywood.
Awkwafina's face looks like it's trying to escape her head
Why Nicholas cage … why
I might actually drag myself into a theater for this!
Flop movie  👎👎
So Dracula lives on Schloss Neuschwanstein
Funny hearing this song after hearing Crowder's parody of it yesterday.
What is this theme song
Fk yes
it looks like a generic action sci-fi movie
Simultaneously talks shit about the Catholic Church and then grabs a pair of Rosary 📿 beads to go stop the evil man. Sorry, you can’t have it both ways. I won’t be watching this trash. It looked ok up until then. Just glad I saw this clip before I wasted my time and money.
I am not missing this one!😂
this looks good
Pros: Nicolas Cage as Dracula Cons: Awkwafina
Thought this movie would be good till I saw Rebecca Quincy, not funny.
I am not feeling Nick Cage in this...😮
This is a crazy as having health insurance these days! And I love it!
Holy shit.  How to take a crap comedy movie project and make it worse... put Nicholas Cage in it and tell him it's a serious project...
Nicolas Cage reminds me of Christopher Lee's young Vampire days.
Absolutetly hyped to see Nic Cage in this one , the other cast look great too ... this has a chance to become a great movie.
Nick Cage keeps getting the worse scripts..
Nicholas Hoult as Vampire apprentice to Dracula Nicholas Cage for 90 years into the present seems very funny amusing! The poignant music like of Suicide Squad 2015 trailer brought out alot of the heart/desire to be free of Renfield in this trailer!! 22.3.2023
I was in until I saw Nicolas Cage
I pray for a Vampire Kiss reference.
I dont know what to think about this. On one hand Nicholas Cage looks fantastic as Dracula and it looks like there will be a fair amount of gore/vampire violence, but on the other hand I dont like the comedy aspect or that Renfield is a parkouring-martial artist. Seems like Hollywood can't make a serious vampire movie anymore. Everything as to be witty or tongue-in-cheek, which kills any tension a monster movie can have. This trailer just showed us that Renfield is pretty much unstoppable so we're not going to care about any "dangerous" situation he get's into.
*good on you Renfield. get your comeuppance ol' chum!!!* 🩸👦🏻🦗
Is this some kind of ripoff story based on What We Do in the Shadows?
Is like Morbious + Joker
Yes
I smiled though this whole trailer which is rare for me. I’m excited
Nick Cage as Dracula must've been so awesome, they had to bring in Aquafina to bring the movie down a notch.
The Catholic Church gets way to much shit. It’s not a bad place, every religion has corrupt or annoying people, and  the Catholic Church has basically just become a punching bag simply because they’re mature enough not to retaliate.  Anyway, this movie looks like it’s gonna be fun.
The relationship between Dracula and Renfield seems like a metaphor for how it is to live with a Narcissist
Aquafina playing Aquafina huh.... I'll pass
As soon as I saw that annoying asian chick.... yea movie ruined
I usually love Nicholas cage characters but I’m not feeling this seems more of a comedy than scary
They gotta stop giving the whole movie away in the trailer.
The problem with Renfield was he wasn't in the Teamsters Union
Give Nick Cage is mf flowers.
Live Action Hotel Transylvania looks good!
When are we gonna get National Treasure 3?
Something tells me that an actual interaction with Nic Cage and Awkwafina would be cool
If Brendan Fraser can make a come back then god damm it so can my boy Nick Cage
Brendan fraser and now nick cage God its good to see the senior actors make a comeback.
this could be a franchise
This looks like so much awesome campy fun! 😃
And akwafena ruined it for me.
If a southern actor with a thick southern accent played the very first Dracula, then Dracula would be forever sportin a southern accent instead of Bella lugozi's accent
Ok can we take in that a Nicky Cage movie IS actually going to theatres
Buena nota espero verla🤩👍👍👍
Did Klauss Schwab write this script? You will eat zeee bugs!
Nicholas Cage as a vampire is how I’ve always imagine vampires growing up.
😏 we all knew Nicolas cage's anti-aging secret long enough if you search for truth on the internet long enough.👍
I love this, but I will say the trailer gave away pretty much the whole movie
Somebody call the Frog brothers!! And kill Dracula! Get holy water, wooden stakes, silver bullets, and rings of garlic!!
A role cage was born to play
I’m starting to admire Awkwafina cause she is hilarious in this as how he did in “Jumanji: Next Level” possessed by Danny DeVito.
This looks really good!
My bro is demoted from Ghost rider to Vampire.
It looked somewhat entertaining until the stupid eXtRemE fighting sequences.
Nic Cage looks like Marilyn Manson haha
Twilight??
I was interested till I noticed awkwafina is playing a significant role. Not a big fan of her acting style.
looks fun. Nick, necking everyone.
At first i though Nicolas Cage would suck as dracula, now i look at him and i see Bela Lugosi
Why do I have a feeling that Officer Rebecca will become a vampire to be with Renfield ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Oh nooo...It's cringe :.(
The Catholic church...😂😂😂😂😂
I'll watch it if it ever goes to a streaming service that I have, maybe.
Hollywood-ized version of 'What we do in the Shadows'...
So good to see Nicholas Cage!!
This is True ArtisticcVision, made by commitee, of course... Hope for the Flowers...
always shootin shi in New Orleans I love it 😮‍💨
Nicolas Cage is one of the best actors of our time.
Aww, a What We DO in Shadows spin-off?
Another trailer that almost gives away the entire plot... Smh
Looks like trash
Old Dracula films you root for the humans, then the 00s you kinda flipfloped between human and Dracula now there is renfield which I can adamantly state I'm rooting for Dracula without a doubt.
How garbage like this gets green light is beyond me.
Giucas casella!!
Is it just me? or does Awkwafina's acting and character here seem identical in all movies?
Looks amazing but Renfeild is acting waaaaay too stable where's the joker like Renfeild personality from the original
ohhhh i remeber him playing in the movie zombie film 🙂i wal freaking high that time think thats what i need to be too to wacth this
Это что-то новое 😂
Beast(X-Men) and Katy Chen(Shang-Chi) vs Ghost Rider
Never liked cage I think his movies are very low budget so chances are this will flop
0:17 Don't mock the church 😁
Fun
IM A VAMPIRE IM A VAMPIRE IM A VAMPIRE IM A VAMPIRE!!!!
nice popcorn movie
Nicholas Cage, vampire, Dracula and comedy?LOL already 😄
I'll watch this... looks bad😂😂
1:04 So that's what happened to Jean Ralphio after faking his death
Looks Bloody Awesome 😂
I already know there's gonna be a lot of motifs and metaphors around dealing with abusive relationships and overcoming it
Say what you will about Nicholas Cage, he still a national treasure in any good or bad movies like this one.
I want to watch it but I probably won’t bc most of what Nichols Cage has been in over the last few years hasn’t been good.
Oh great, another trailer that gave away the plot
This looks super awesome. Def gonna see it when it hits theatres
Tim Burton’s Dark Shadows🙄
I'm a catholic but not even i can deny that the "most trusted instituiton on earth" was genius
Christopher Lee is that you 😭😭😭
This is not how I thought this movie was going to be. Kinda lost interest now /:
funny perhaps?   😀😀😀😀😀
This looks void of THE MESSAGE..so it looks pretty good..I actually wanna see this movie
Yeah I'm definitely going to check this out.
That cop is gonna ruin the movie. She sucks in all of her movies and is not funny.
Mildly interested, but why would they show him fighting Dracula in the trailer 😐
as a fan of the novel, I am excited!!!
It's depressing that this kind of movie is liked.
Seeing Nic Cage as Dracula puts a smile on my face
He looks like Christopher Lee's Dracula ( Dracula: Prince of Darkness 1966 )
Nicholas is always able to reinvent himself, His longevity is insane.
Fan fact: Nicholas cage didn't know that he was filming he just doing what he does every day
Nicolas Cage looks like Christopher Lee form the 70’s Dracula movies!
It’s morbin time?
The Oscars are canceled. Here’s your winner right here 👍🏻 Nicolas Cage is so awesome!! ❤❤❤
this actually looks like this gonna be a great film
This looks ridiculous - - - Can't wait as we could all use some ridiculous these days.
Good actor but make many worst movies in his career
Nick Cage & Nicholas Hoult will slay & be badass as Dracula & Renfield!
Looks like it would be fun if not for the politics
After so many years from that kiss, Nicolas Cage is finally a vampire. Worth the wait.
Noooo that faker  is still taking credit of my race
They gave the whole movie away
Can someone please make a Part II of the "Dracula untold" ????
Next time show the full movie! Oh you just did...🤦‍♂️
Imagine falling for Akw. Exactly, only in a movie!
I so want to see this! It's a unique take on Dracula and I am a big fan of Nicolas Cage and the actor playing Reinfield.
I liked that one guy in Warm Bodies
Can’t wait
but... where is the empowered woman to safe the day? HOW DARE YOU?
I like that Dracula is a more traditional look.  I hope this movie doesn't suck... no pun intended.  Even if it doesn't do the greatest, I hope it's not just another woke piece of shit movie that wants to push "the message".  I will throw all my money at it as long as it's just a normal movie.
Most trusted institutions of earth "the catholic Church" is the most interesting part of the trailer
I'M A VAMPIRE I'M A VAMPIRE I'M A VAMPIRE
Cage as a Dracula seems so logical. I'm looking forward to some good laughs in this flick.
Finally… Hollywood is making big budget films for Nicolas cage again! We need more insane movies like this with him.
I could have helped Dracula win the fight. If I was there in the movie could summon Delepters and MAgnAfowl for reinforcements.
What Nic Cage did in the shadows
gotta love some nic cage.
PLEASE NO AWKWAFINA!!! JESUS! just ruined this movies for me. Even Mic Cage can't make up for her 🤮🤮
The used of Creep in this is amazing. Sucked me into the trailer.
It's morbin time!
Nice Morbius but actually good :D :D
Ooh I saw a short film like this that was done by Omeleto. It's called The Familiar.
Yes always loved Nicholas Cage
Nichols Cage look great as a vampire, everything else look cheap.
Beautiful
Why has nobody made a Nic Cage vampire movie sooner?
Looking forward to seeing both Nicholas in frame together (Nicholas cage+Nicholas hoult)
I hope Cage gets his own Dracula flick!
Hell yes
So Renfield is R's real name?
Morbius 2 looks crazy
Fascinating...
Looks fucking terrible
Two great nicks looks actually good
This is literally Morbius but 100x better.
Did the trailer just show how he kills Dracula 😢 spoiler and then some.
I think a lot of people are going to like this movie. Cage is eating it up.
Fresh
What the background music?
Cage is a sick actor 🤷🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Man he must be getting some good checks for so many shitty movies. Guy has an appetite for the good things in life.
Wtf happened to films ?!!!
Nicholas Cage as a vampire….I’m gonna pass on anymore cheesiness
I hope this is the start of a rebirth of Universal's terrific monster stable. Treated with love and care, that is a fertile universe of entertainment.
Awesome trailer
Nicolas Cage merece que vaya al cine después de 6 años mas o menos
Nicolas Cage as Dracula. The only reason I need to watch this movie. Overall looks very fun movie too.
This is going to be a cult classic.
Not the first time nick played Dracula
Love me some Nicholaus Cage
Great movie.
Jean-Ralphio!
I can't wait for new memes with Cage!

Oh... whenever Nicholas Hoult is pale...
He IS a vampire!
Fuckin aquafina
I have seen some Cage movies where he doesn't seem that into the role or the film. This doesn't look like it will be one of those.
Sorry so not a fan of Awkwafina...Though it does have both Hoult and Cage so there is that.
Refiled : a morbius prequel
Nicholas Cage really won't turn down any role, will he...
This movie is gonna be a Gem
trailer literally spoils the entire movie, wont be watching this shit
For a movie about an abusive relationship and very gory, it sure seems light hearted.
So glad we're seeing Marilyn Manson starring a movie now
Couldn't dracula just take away his powers?
Looks awesome.  I like the original trailer a lot more though.
CREEP???
Dracula: Some call me the dark one...others the lord of death...or say I look like someone called Nicholas Cage which I'm not gonna lie the resemblance is uncanny. Although one person did accidentally mistaken me for a man called Jared Leto which is absurd since i'm a mutch better vampire than he is.
oh alright ?
A movie that nobody asked for. This looks cringe af.
Nicolas Cage as Dracula is such great casting, I don’t understand why no one has thought of it before.
He finally gets his vampire movie! High praise.
Wow a Radiohead deepcut.
Now...THIS is a movie. :)
Bathed in that Schumacher hot lights in every color?  Yes, please.  Let’s do this!
This looks like pure popcorn fun and I'm here for it!
I have a feeling that the climax of this movie will be renfield fighting against him in like a physical fight and him trying to see what he can do to win
This movie is truely bringing out the dead in Nicolas Cage.
I love the opening shot of the back of Neuschwanstein. ~ Reverse disney castle easter egg!
Only bad thing about this movie, is Awkwafina
Nic Cage as Dracula is gold, can just about put up with 90mins of Awkwafina for that
It's actually fitting to have Nicolas Cage as Dracula considering he already has a resemblance to Bela Lugosi
I love the look of this. Nicholas Cage always gives it 110%. In fact, he ages so annoyingly well... not sure this might be semi-biographical. Anyway, it's going to be added to my list of 'Must See Films' - and, until recently, that list has been gathering dust.
Cannot freakin wait
Nicks finally found a role to suit him best that we all want!
It’s Renin’ time
Guillermo?
Old dracula be loke : u have changed man oo😂
Seeing William Ragsdale in a Dracula movie is freaking awesome, good ol' Charlie Brewster. 😊
Ah! Good old movies kinda vibe not ruined by "the message".
0:16 THAT FACE THOUGH 😂
Here's a fun fact:  Only few people down here in the comment section are able to spell his name correctly.
what is up with the audio mixing on the actor's voices? Recently they put this filter on people's voices that make it end up sounding so raspy and often times incoherent.
Hmmm, trying to hard to be zany and cool. Not sure I could stomach a whole movie of this
Anything with Aquafina is a hard pass, not even nick cage can make it worth it.
Nick Cage looks *amazing* as Dracula, I absolutely LOVE Nicholas Hoult ever since Warm Bodies and this gives me the same sort of vibes; horror comedy with a bit of a twist. I will absolutely watch this!
Sono veramente convinti di portare sta roba al cinema
Its just like my ancestors
Why is this japanese lady in everything?
After seeing what Chris McCay did with the action scenes of The Tomorrow War, I cannot wait to see his work here !
Everything good until the chick starts talking cringy asf🫤
Man at 0:10 nic looks spot on to Bela Lugosi with a nice hint of Christopher Lee
from zombie to vampire
I knew he was a vampire
I'll take a look.
you got me with the song even when it will not be in the movie.
Nicholas fits in every role he has played till date.Nicholas is an amazing actor👍👍
why do Hollywood Kabbalists think it's ok to smear Catholics at every turn but if you merely point out an iota of a flaw in their cabal, you get attacked viciously as an  anti Semite?  Seems hypocritical and bigoted.
RENFIELD IS A EMANCIPATION FROM TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS LIKE BIRDS OF PREY 😂😂 AND IT LOOKS CAMPY WITH SOME ......................SPECIAL, EFFECTS .........CGI BLOOD NEVER HURT NOBODY THOUGH EVEN THOUGH SOME LOOK LIKE PRACTICAL EFFECTS I HOP AND THE ACTION SEQUENCES ARE VERY MORBIUS AND THAT NOT A INSULT BECAUSE THE ACTION IN M WAS THE BEST PART OF THE GARBAGE 😊😂
Nick Cage as Dracula. like im hooked from that. The only way they can fuck it up is if he is barely in the film
seated
Haha 😂😂 that Catholic Church bit had me rolling.. The most trusted institution on earth.. lol
Loving the Bela lugois look
Man this Morbius movie is awesome
Nicolas Cage = shit
Wtf did i just watch?
Whoever decided to make Nic Cage Dracula is a freakin genius.
In short *YES*
POV: Nick Cage in his flop era
Sweet Christmas dead meat is gonna have a field day with this
Hey JEAN RALPHIO!!!
Why showing me all the movie in the final trailer🧐?
Nic Cage is in a new movie? Take my money already!!!
Why is this cringey Chinese in movie
Can't wait for the fnaf movie 🔥🍥👻
OK, seeing Nick Cage as Dracula, I have to ask...  WHEN IS "WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE SS" GOING TO BE MADE???  I want to see Nick Cage as Fu Manchu!!!
The funniest part of this is that Cage actually looks a lot like Bela Lugosi in the costume.
"Renfield", or as I prefer to call it: "Morbius 2: Morbious Harder. Starring Nicolas Cage."
It's Morbin Time!
Redfall?
It's A Horrible Job Renfield But You Have To Do It Or I'll Fire You
Nicholas cage can finally become a vampire and became a true meme!
wtf is this ?? a fun movie???
Can someone explain how it is possible for vampires to be in sunlight many scenes in trailer shows them in the sunlight I don’t know what’s going on
Nicholas Cage as Dracula  Ok now i can say i reallly see “Everything”
You just want to tell Renfield there are worse jobs out there.
just don't kill Dracula at the end
Cold Bodies.
As fun as Nic Cage is, What We Do In The Shadows kinda fills this void...
one of my favourite actor
nic cage is an absolute movie legend.........
Jesus is the way, the truth and the life. You're welcome.
The music in this trailer is 👨‍🍳💋
This looks like dogshit. I can’t wait to see it.
Finally, a movie that can contest Morbius. This battle will be legendary!
Why even watch the movie. The trailer has shown everything already.
This will bomb
It looks good,except for the part where Hollywood is shoving white male Asian females on us again.
Beast Boy and Shang Chi's friend vs. Ghost Rider.
love that they are expanding on the morbverse
What people don't realize is that Nick Cage is actually in fact a vampire. Which now explains a shit ton of stuff.
I just watched the whole movie in 2 min trailer
What a tune
Looks good
This looked great until I seen akwafina... she is not funny or a good actor... no one learned after the ten rings?
The only reason I’ll be watching this movie is cuz Nick Cage is Dracula
i was gonna watch this till i realized it had the chick with the man voice in it now im skipping it
Nicholas Hoult channelling his Beast form once again
Aquafina is in this?! Oh hell no sorry but I’m not gonna watch
Ah, I see they finally made Vampire's Kiss 2
This is one of those trailers that basically shows the whole movie
Big Morbius energy
Chris McKay, the director of Renfield, had revealed that this movie is a direct sequel to Tod Browning's Dracula (1931). Hoorah!
I won’t lie, ‘I deserve to be happy’ is actually a really good theme for a movie and for some reason it’s not one that’s used that often
I...I...Is Nicolas Cage playing Dracula for god sake!!!!!
Ghost rider become vampire, MorbiusRider
Renfield: I want Respect. Dracula: No, here's my counter offer, I'll get you an assistant. Renfield: Sounds reasonable.
right when I was feeling nostalgic for dracula daily ♥️
A low cost trash
Nic looks like the joker. Guess it's going to be a fun watch
Fast and furious, Kung Fu Dracula 🤣
this is so so so bad and I thought it was fake, but in being so bad it is..... good..? lol idk, it seems one of those kinda things, you just can't look away
Showing to much in trailers is a bad thing
Now this…is a popcorn 🍿 refil movie haha 🙌🏾!!!
No thanks I'll pass 😒
HE'S A VAMPIRE HE'S A VAMPIRE HE'S A VAMPIRE
Nicholas cage and acting are two things that should never go together.
I like Cage but pass.
Nic Cage is back - with a vengeance. Who said it doesn't pay to make 2-4 movies a year for 20 years...?!?
Get rid of nic cage, movie would be much better
Damn, it's Radiohead
Something tells me my crush on Ben Schwartz is only going to get stronger
This looks 102% trash
Crazy man Nick the Cage😍
radiohead W
Oh this looks absolutely ridiculous AND I LOVE IT
I really like actually how Renfield gets his power from eating critters just like how he thought he did in the books. Emphasis on thought, the man was just a looney who worshipped Dracula for some reason
This looks horrendous.
This is going to be a really exciting movie and I’m looking forward to seeing this because it’s a tribute to the classic Universal Monsters movies especially 1931’s “Dracula!” 🧛‍♂️🦇🖤🖤👏👏
Catholic: We have come to save you… People: Yay it’s the Catholic Church Catholic: From yourselves People: Oh on it’s the Catholic Church
This goes in pretty Evil! 🤣
Nicholas Cage as Drácula in a action comedy horror movie? Looks good!
So, Ghost Rider and Beast 😁
I forgot this was a thing 😂
Why does this trailer reminds me of Warm Bodies (2013) already. Like it couldn't be, right ?
Can't wait 👍
Whoever is giving Awkwafina these lines needs to be fired; they are really hard to listen to.
va a ser muy entretenida.. esta muy bien ya en los trailers se puede ver primado negativo interesante..
Sick of old songs slowed down for dramatic effect on these trailers.  Play the original all the way or fuck off.
Looks fun😅🤟
This looks horrible... I love it
On my most anticipated list.
An inside job side plot becomes a movie
I don't know about the movie, but this trailer is horrible. It's honestly one of the worst trailers I've ever seen.
love this i'm excited to see it! Nicholas Cage fits to play Dracula!
Nic Cage is going to feast on every CM of every scene he will be in. Always Be Caging
please let this be as good as we want it to be
please let this be as good as I want it to be
"I work for Dracula" "Count Dracula?" No, Bob Dracula. He lives just the road.
A very VERY unnecessary trailer. But ok
Are we moving away from the endless cycle of Marvel garbage towards real movies again?
I honestly believe Cage as Dracula is fantastic casting and deserved a more serious horror film, instead of this... Marvel-style humor "comedy".
🖤🖤🖤
I really hope this movie lives up to it's trailers.
Beast vs Mobuis 😂
uhm, did...did we just watch the entire movie right now?
Leaveee something for the F MOVIE mannnn
got an instant flashback of the vampires assistant. cant wait to see this movie
F🩸ck yeah
Okay, Dracula killing the priest by turning into mist, going inside him, and exploding out of him was a pretty brutal kill even for ol' Drac.
Yea, screw the Catholic Church! LGBTQ+ is a better religion!
Just amazing
Excited so so....
I'm so sorry Thom
Let be honet here...this ia basically Nicholas Cage old movie  Vampire Kiss
"The most trusted institution on Earth!"....."The Catholic Church." What a very honest & uplifting line. I see there's absolutely nothing wrong with it whatsoever 🙂
Why is the whole plot of the movie in the trailer????
Im literally watching Dracula: Dead and Loving It right now, then I saw this trailer thumbnail and title and thought it was going to be Renfield from that movie.  I was expecting a comedy spoof, Leslie Nielsen style, but then it dawned on me that hes gone and we'll never have that again.  So sad.
One ticket for the two-Nicholas show, please, and thank you.
Since Vampires Kiss I've been waiting for Nicholas Cage to return to his roots.
Ben Schwartz finally showed up, Im guessing he sent the guys with guns.
It's nice to see that Nick Cage is truly back.
NICKFEST!!!!!!
Maybe I’d watch it late at night streaming. Going to a theater for $40+. Gtfo
Id get rid of the slow motion action and keep it at regular speed, but other than that 👌🏾
So like warm bodies but with vampires
TO A NEW WORLD OF GODS AND MONSTERS!
Different vampire Dracula looks monstrous.
what. the. fuck
Noice
"Stop serving, start living". I've heard that a lot from friends who are alone and penniless reaching their 50s
Is it morb'ng time??
Not Only I Will See This For As a Fan of Nicolas Cage But Also For My Guy Ben Schwartz!
The part he was made to play
This looks fu... Nope. Spoke to soon. Awkwafina is in it. Never mind.
just saw the movie for free! thank you trailer!
For once a "cheesy movie trailer song cover" might be near as good as the original that high note was awesome! I really like all the gore and the world they created around Renfield definitely gets at that horror vibe but then Aquafina grounds it in reality too.
When you realize it is Ghost Rider and the Beast.😆
I though dracula is marilyn manson  😂
I loved the part when he said “It’s Nic Cagin’ time” and caged the bad guys
NIC CAGE IS DRACULA
Neuschwanstein??? Realy??? There a thousands of castles all over europe and you took the one everyone knows.
It's cool that they're portraying Dracula as a murdering, egomaniacal bully. His teeth look like Shark teeth.
This film looks like a lot of fun and hella entertaining, I can’t wait to see it. Nick Cage as Dracula was a good choice!!  Also if awkwafina is the love interest I’m fully onboard with that.
From X-Man to Zombie Boyfriend and then to Vampire
Da f**k Cage as a vampire?
I'm excited for this movie
I love how they put creep as the music
watching this cause Nic Cage as Dracula sounds like pure entertainment. This man is a national treasure pun intended.
Now, I am excited, first I was quite curious. This looks like quite the romp.
I'm excited for this movie. Looks like it's gonna be fun. Also, approve of Awkwafina as the love interest too.
RADIOHEAD - CREEP
This movie looks solid
The morbius we deserve
A second trailer for the movie "Renfield" and it is still as funny as hell like the first trailer 🙂😅🤣 Can't wait for the movie though 🙂
Amazing
This movie is a sequel to the 1931 Dracula movie apparently
2:07 to 2:15 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Another Nicolas Cage Vampire Again
Is this sequel from warm bodies?
Nicholas Holt is giving me James Marsden vibes.
This trailer revealed way too much.
Morbius 2
I’m going to be disappointed if he doesn’t say his iconic line It’s Morbin Time
I'm gonna be honest this actually looks so good...also Nicholas cage as a vampire actually suits him...the song they used is so perfect you gotta love creep by radiohead
This looks great and very epic and a lot of fun too I can't wait to see it 😊
That’s dope 🔥🔥🔥
asian supporting actress good job Hollywood 😂
Going to see it at the Overlook Film Festival next week. Nicolas Cage will be there in person. How cool is that?
Radiohead - Creep is really a strange choice.
Vo dentiste SON CAPABLE
