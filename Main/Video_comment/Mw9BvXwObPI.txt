@cuppycakesrawrable is a stubborn baby because he or she said God's name in vain.
I'm just realising how much of a fever dream these movies are
I never saw the first Spy Kids movie growing up, but I did, for some ungodly reason, have a double feature DVD of 2 & 3..I think my parents hated me..
Watch the theorizer cover shark boy and lava girl, total mind bending trippalation ❤
8:32 That somehow made her kick stronger? Even though it would normally have the opposite effect.
13:59 no God does not stay in heaven, for he sent his Holy Spirit to live among us and Jesus Christ, his son which they’re all God three in one but I know his creation despises him, and I can’t imagine how that feels
13:45 This line goes really hard for a Robert Rodriguez film
i mean… most of use remember Rodriguez for Desperado, but yeah… Shark Boy something something i guess🤷‍♂️
67
As a 90s kid, Alexa vega was one of my first celebrity crushes
Spy Kids: Escaping Epsteins Island.
The presidents daughter is acting essentially like boruto lol
0:19 not me having this on in the background as I'm trying to platinum KH final mix..
this movie exists solely as a setup for that one steve buscemi line.
Epstein island
The absolute best part about that quote is that it came from SPY KIDS. That’s something you’d expect to hear in like Shakespeare or something lmao
Man, Anthony Flags was in everything back then
15:36 HANK HILL?!
I liked the spy kids 1 and 2, 3 was bad and 4 was unwatchable.
God stays  in heaven  bc cause it heaven  you RAT
there was a 2 and 3 where th was i 😂
The president won douchebag of the year too? Such a multitalentend man
13:45 I think about that quote everyday
The vomiter ride made me jump tbh
13:43 This line was so unnecessary yet so true
I was today years old when I realized the Mike Judge was Donnagon Giggles. Was listening to this video in the background and heard him say "Did you find the source of equal or greater power?" And I thought  "Hank Hill?"
Actually that Spider guy thing WAS my actuall Sleep Paralysis Demon
The only problem I have this movie is why they blamed it on Junie. He had the device in his hand, but Gary gone away, but they blame it on Junie they blame it on Julian and fired him from spy kids it’s by for a biggest plot hole where it’s literally Gary’s fault in the first place
Why does Gary have shit in his mouth?
Do you think God stays in heaven, because he to lives in fear of what he’s created… here on earth…
Is that… six flags over Texas???!??!??!?
Ok, but did anyone else really want to eat that pasta from the party?
I love that the amusement park has a boot leg top thrill in the background
I hate to tell you but um, she wasnt hitting him up for his warhammer 40k figuerines 😅
I finally figured it out! The reason that Antonio Banderas jump in front of his in laws is because they both inexplicably have pacemakers that would have been shut off by the transmooker device.
Spy Kids 4: Return to Epstein Island
11:42 no, that would be his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and his Germaphobia, and his off the chart detective skills!
I HAVE BEEN FALLING FOR 30 MINUTES!!!
Anybody else realize some of the creatures were junis drawings?
Random shout but bro should play the Kingdom Heart Collection and potentially speedrun the games its quite fun and the games aged quite well considering.
Yea why did I watch the first one but not the sequel or third film?   Strange   And it seems to be a patterns since you also missed the others
Six flags over Texas in the first scene!!
7:30 the guards would never join and drink the champagne as well, their whole job is to stand there and guard Not drink champagne and toast their new boss
And all these years later we are still trying to figure out what is happening in/to kingdom hearts.
Pentagon? didn't this come out less than year after 9/11? seem strange
13:20 oohhh Megaman Legends reference
The Mom is hot
2:10 crusty jugulars!!!
5:15 ok I have to comment because I've seen this channel remark several times on how "well an actress" has aged.       Dude, for someone who must know about the film industry, I would have to assume you know about the insane amount of plastic surgery being done, not to mention just simple things like lighting, lens filters, and post production CGI "makeup" for actors on screen.    It seems surprisingly naive!   The images you see of most celebrities aren't PHOTOGRAPHS - they're closer to being paintings.
Juni Rocket Racer Rebel Cortez...  His dad must have won a bet.
Runs finger over cup. "Yep, that's a roofie, alright."
Gary's weird ass laugh came back like an old friend.
Not to mention that the device looks different from the beginning of the movie to the end
I think its called island of lost dreams because Juni has some dreams about the creatures ramero made...hes even got a few drawing of them before he ever went to the island
"Do you think God stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?"
Woah, warhammer 40k mentioned!?
I liked these movies as a kid and like them now, and the second part is my favorite. Robert Rodriguez was able to make something very creative and very fun to watch.
How did Gary and Gerti not see a giant pile of poop in front of them?
9:02 I would of sung gary
7:18 "Then the adults drink their sparkling milk and you'll never guess what happens" EBAY AD PLAYS
13:45 yeah dude Spy Kids 2 had one of the most iconic quotes in all of TV history
16:31 The heck is that 😂😂😂
I see Wood Oak City... 6:09
5:22 Holy shit I did NOT realize that was the mom from HoHH holy shit
The president's daughter is Cindy Lou Who! AKA the lead singer of The Pretty Reckless 😍
Juni has the same acting prowess as Tobey Maguire in Spiderman
10:15 arent they from san antonio aha
The Steve Buscemi line was so profound too bad as children it went over our heads but I’m pretty sure our parents were looking at the screen like the way he reacted😂😂😂😂
Spy Kids 2 is still a banger to me, I  enjoy rewatching it and I’m 28 now lol
Highlight of this video was data from megaman legends being in the animation
This whole channel is brainrot with brainrot commentary.
17:59 clearly hes tryna shut off gramps pacemaker XD
Does Georgie know Mandy was doing this???
12:46 spooky buscemi lurking 😂😂
Don't lie bro. You didn't fast forward. You watched the whole thing haha
Anyone else think that Gerte and Gary's dad sort of looked like a discount Dr.Phil while growing up?   Nope. . . just me. . . ? Cool.
I refuse to accept that Steve Buscemi, Tony Shalhoub, Bill Paxton, and Ricardo Montalban were hired just to be in this... THIS... these types of movies. 😔
what bothered me even as a kid is the food they are eating 6:53 everyone is just eating plain cheap pasta 😬
X'D That Kingdom Hearts comment, makes me feel like we could be some decent friends if we met, if only cause you'd at least not give me shit for liking Kingdom Hearts like others tend to... ;u;
13:02 You say this after ignoring Antonio Banderas. 🤣🤣🤣
U skipped the in-laws, machete. Machete is important for the transporter
The park guy is of course the greatest actor of all time… Bill Paxton!!!!
I feel you on the kingdom hearts... we're family now lol
You seem to mention breeding with sonic quite a bit.  Is there something you wanna talk about, bro ?
10:18 -Why his name is Apple Cider? -Because his mom loves apple cider. -Why his name is Pepto Bismol? -Because his parents love pepto bismol. -Thanks, dad -No problem, Racist Jokes
When I was around 6-7, this was my favorite movie.
"They take a drink of a sparkling milk and you'll never guess what happens next!" *Ad pops up* Totally didn't expect that Alex 😂
Does anyone know the butterfly in the sky song ive been looking for ever and i cant find it plz help
Why'd Gary share the same name as Gary Oak from Pokemon? And why didn't I recognize Emily Osment on Hanna Montana years after Spy Kids 2 came out?
The spider thing reminds me of the Scorpion king cgi 😂
Why carmen standing next to that blonde guy and not her brother😭
Super mario bros 2 music threw me off lmao
13:46 oh so that's where that meme comes from thanks
4:47  REALLY NOOOOOO it’s Maddie lamberts child Evelyn (sarcastically)
Spy children in spy kids movie
13:55 lmao 😅😅😅
9:39  A tree with a door in it, not suspicious at all
2:09 ITS THE EXTREME
bro i understand that you gotta get that ching ching but man you really be gettin a sponsor every video bro
Make a video about "cats and dogs" best movie ever.
Does anyone know the song that plays during the thanks for watching part !!??
Okay, but has anyone else seen Meghan Trainor and the spy kid's babies? They look JUST LIKE HIM
5:06 this movie really wanted us to believe the US government was rolling around in Isuzu Axiom’s
I mean it’s not like we care, it’s a kid movie that was funny and cool at the time.
DUDE WHAT IS THAT SONG AT THE END I FORGOT ABOUT THAT SONG AAAAHHH IS IT CALLED FLAMINGOSIS OR SOEMTHING ALXBFLWOB  edit: 😎 football head - flamingosis
That's the type of thing you see at the foot of your bed and your sleep. Demon is standing right next to you. Saying The heck is that? :me: It's too early in the Night to deal with this shit. Good night
5:26 can we stop calling that actress only by her first name like she’s wholly unique
Little Taylor Momsen!! 😮 I had no idea she was in this movie. 😂
I remember when I was 7 years old, watching this on VHS. I would always pause and rewind THE scene:   "Do you think... God stays in heaven because he, too, is afraid of what he's created... here in on earth?"  There was just something about this moment that gave me chills.  Perhaps it was the way Buscemi stares out into the distamce, takes off his glasses, delivers the line "do you think..." with a pause, then asking the infamous question, and finally the beautiful yet mysterious (even slightly ominous) music playing in the background...  It gave me the idea that the universe could be far bigger, more mysterious, and far scarier than anybody knows — almost like cosmic horror.  I know that after seeing this, I started internally questioning what I was taught in Sunday school.  I went on to major in philosophy in college...
12:41 cool rheneas 😁
Spy kids 2 is just g rated re4 if you really think about it
This movie got Tony Shalhoub and Steve Buscemi in it! I didn’t not remember that
"The president's daughter!"  That's Funny, I could swear her name was Valentine...
10:57 🤢🤮Oh God!! While I'm eating?!
I remember that they used to play these movies a ton in Disney XD, although only 1 and 3 the almost never aired the second movie and as a kid I was curious why they didn’t do it and I wanted to watch the second one more out of curiosity, until one day they aired a spy kids marathon with all 3 movies, and that weekend, my family went to vacation to the mountains, then months later they did another marathon and I had to go to a birthday party, but they replayed the marathon later at night so I stayed up till 11 pm when the second movie started, and my curiosity was finally satisfied, I don’t even remember if I liked the movie, I think maybe I thought it was ok, found the title to not make sense and made sense why they didn’t air it as much, but it was still great finally knowing what the second movie was about
Wow
So wild that the actor who played Juni is married to Meghan Trainor
Spy Kids creators: Is it cool? Random person: Yeah, but it doesn't make any sense Spy Kids creators: How bout I do anyway~  Honestly I kind of wish more things were like Spy Kids, they truly understood the Rule of Cool
Appreciate the shout-out  Edit: my sleep demon wrote this.
I still can’t tell if this movie is really good or really bad?
I swear this dude keeps downing my childhood. Dude needs a filter. Shut your damn mouth. This movie was peak when I was growing up. Take the phrase" if you aint got anything nice to say then shut your fucking mouth" and use it dammit
saw the second one first, then the first.
omg thanks for these reactions which are also recaps for me! I've only seen the 3rd 3D Spy Kids many many times, as I later got it on DVD, but never the first two! Nice to see what all the characters that come in the end on the third one actually do in the first two movies.
12:42 Rheneas cameo
Do you ever have a dream tha tha you uh -15:57
Alex, don't you dare diss on Warhammer 40k. That's where I draw my imaginary line!
Personally, Spy Kids 2 is my favorite in the series.  Also, I know it's stupid, but I will always love Gerti's helicopter hair.
1:40 I am pretty sure she just said n*gga
I saw this as a kid, according to my grandma Steve buccimi is a distant relative of mine.
I watched spy kids 3 first, then spy kids 1, then spy kids 2 😂
Watching this movie as an adult is freaking crazy
12:23 portal 2 chapter 6: the fall be like:
This is the only Spy Kids movie I ever got to see, a lot. My grandparents were very Catholic and media was limited.   Oh if they only knew that this movie made me realize that god is afraid of us.
Bruh why did u point out the thumb man had a dump truck…💀
I definitely don’t trust anyone who doesn’t know how to squirrel
Well that was kirby music.
Judy's biggest crime is wearing a tux with shorts.
12:28 I now know where that one “how long have we been falling” audio came from
Isn't the president's daughter the little girl from the Grinch? Looks just like herrr.
Epstien island
Your reaction to that quote was absolutely perfect.
16:31 Ayooo me and my sleeping paralysis homie on same boat today 😂
8:47 I don't remember the movie but maybe they give him death stare cuz he's a kid of the guy who could've become new OSS president? Aka maybe they blamed him cuz he is the only spy kid with ulterior motives? Idk still weird  15:28 I think the point was to frame Judi is guilty, and since he with his sis were very first spy kids, they are probably most experienced so getting rid of one of them would make his plans go more smoothly... Or atleast I think that's the point
I remember my dad renting this movie for me and my sisters to watch on dvd. He made his special popcorn in those old school popcorn makers. He'd always add a ridiculous amount of melted butter and salt to it. Good memories
As a kid, these movies were incredible. As an adult, it's the dumbest shit i've ever seen. But I still love it
You remind me of Dunkey when you’re flabbergasted.
the reading rainbow theme song sample at half speed combined with the facial expression and context of the joke took me outttttt lmfaoo
12:26 portal 2, the fall chapter.
That kingdom hearts part really hit home 😂
That kingdom hearts part really hit home 😂
Never realized how much of a mumble mouth the kid is in these movies.
9:55 I SWEAR! I heard junie rocket razor redbull Cortez. I swear
Luke 13:1-5 New International Version  Repent or Perish  13 Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2 Jesus answered, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? 3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. 4 Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.”
that's from THIS movie!?
I HEARD WAR HAMMER FIGURE WE NEED A WAR HAMMER FIGURE VIDEO
13:45 the quote
Somebody ring the dinkster?
so to scramble radar, you blast it with MORE radar which coincidentally can cook an egg at 100ft
The Amusement Park at the beginning is Six Flags Over Texas.
I love that carmen has a full spanish name and juni is juni rocket racer rebel cortez XD
JESUS IS COMING REEPENT
Juni's french voice actor is sooo much better than the OG
My guy married Meghan Trainor so give him so respect!🤣
8:16 Alex's reaction kills me
You shouls look for the behind the scenes, Rodriguez does this movies based on his children's ideas. Its really cool.
13:46 DAMN LMAO TO DEEP
RIP Bill Paxton. One of his greatest acting roles.
When he stared into the camera and asked me if I thought God stayed in Heaven because of being scared of His own creation, I thought for a moment and said: "no. no I do not." I don't think he heard me though.
why is mike judge in these movies
I was wondering why Gary and Gerti's dad sounded like Hank Hill... Because Donnagon is played by Mike Judge 💀😂
Simon swipe
Forget about it being fast, is the ride even safe?!?!?!?!
As a adult the only thing that took me out of this movie is the beginning park is clearly just 6 flags with some cgi and the juggler is just in the weirdest spot and I'm like, why is it so close to mr freeze and batman🤣🤣🤣
I think you have to watch Rodriguez movies as if they are dreams. They make no sense , they can be all over the place, and they have some of our favorite actors in them.
I about lost it at 13:45 - keep up the great videos and great work
Screwed Reading Rainbow 😳 😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don't actually know if I've ever seen this movie. There are some scenes that look vaguely familiar, some scenes I recognize from memes, but most of it looks completely unfamiliar.
So tired of creators monitizing my childhood with 50+ adds AND paid promotion. Like bruh
Dude I remember as a kid thinking Gertie ATE during that scene with the guard. No way it was this cringe 😭😭
I love your comedy. You are hilarious.
Wait... is Mike Judge the villain? Damn. Everyone was in these Spy Kids movies.
I miss Bill Paxton. 😢
Carmen was my crush when I was 8 years old... What is up to these days 🤔
I literally don't remember anything about this movie except the falling in the volcano
Anyone else had to pause the film when they heard that line; "Do you think God stays in Heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created," for the first time?
9:14 unemployed at 11... what a tragedy 😆
9:01 I felt that so hard as a kid
I dont know how long this video was, my watch doesnt tell time.
If you had a crush on the girl who played Carmen, you really need to watch "Repo! The Genetic Opera"
"Best spys on the force" you mean one being the girl that casually hacks into your systems and puts your whole operation at risk because of it?
Your reactions Alex have my ribs hurting 🤣🤣🤣
😶😶
I paused the video at the best time! 16: 35     It looks like she's kicking him in the face!
Whats the song at 13:55 please
I remember loving this movie, almost more than the first one.
16:23 for something from the early 2000s its not bad actually
One thing I remember about this movie is just how good the Swedish dub was for it.   Like this OG English sounds kinda bad in comparison, which is a very rare thing.
As a danish kid, i have seen all of the spy kids movies (that i have seen) in danish. It is only recently that i realize that i know some of these actors from elsewhere. Like that dad from bridge to Therabitea or whatever, is actually Cabe from Scorpion and T-1000 from terminator 2. And the guy who plays Mr. Minion is also Adrian Monk
Gertie has the same power as Dixie Kong  That creature looks like the Scorpion King from the Mummy Returns
Ok my only question really is... whats with the long names? Im hispanic, 30 and have known or met literally dozens of hispanic families in my life. Ive never seen anyone with such a ridiculously long name. Spy kids and "Zack and Cody" always f**ked me up about that
...So...Donnagan was played by Mike Judge....? As in...The creator of Beavis And Butthead Mike Judge? As in...King of the Hill Mike Judge? I...huh?
Man, Spy loss could've actually been a cool series, like a live action kids next door. Too bad they leaned hard into the "low-budget" feel instead of making it actually good
Just gonna put this out, you missed a fantastic opportunity to make a joke about the giggles being in deep shit or a jeff goldblum "that is one big pile of shit" reference
Fun fact: The guy in charge of the theme park at the beginning of the movie is also the guy who was Bill from Twister, if you've ever seen it
I think doing review for the actual star trek movies would be pretty fun, the fifth one is riotously bad and I'm pretty sure at least one character has a beard you can spin around in the animation
Yahdah Yahuah Yahusha for life
8:21 i loved that bit/laugh,got me laughing hard
13:45 Tony B before he met Tony soprano
the movie is my favourite movie solely because of the submarine wasp thing that served juni fries and also because spider monkey = cool
Thx for ruining one of my favorite movies when I was a kid… but in a fun/funny way
I feel like this movie revolutionized the way spy movies were made especially on a kids point of view it can be seen in phineas and ferb where the Peru was a spy and had all kinds of cool gadgets
Can you please do A video of the odd squad please? If you can tomorrow
He got fucking 2mil off this shit Jesus Christ ok one everyone understands the most simplest kids movie spy Kids but this fucking guy over doing a rant how complicated this movie 😂😂😂😂 please if this dude thinks this movie is to hard to understand then he can go watch the backyardagins
I loved the first spykids, a big part of it was that I had really bad Worts on my hands as a kid and i too had a bunch of bandages on my fingers. Granted mine were more gause and less band aids lol but split the difference
Hey you should do a video on Repo! Staring our favorite spy kid, Alexa Vega Also the Machete movies
These movies just seem like esoteric takes on "how bad can we make a movie and still turn a profit"
13:40
I prob comment on 1 video per thousand I watch but that my date with the presidents daughter reference is so goated
I had such a crush on Carmen as a kid and Alexa PenaVega is 🔥 right now
"How long have we been falling??" "I don't know, my watch doesn't tell time!"  Still love this quote XD
Carla Gugino is just lovely
all the spy kids movies gave me like a headache but i still loved them
The president’s daughter being the lead singer for The Pretty Reckless is pretty insane to me lol
🫶
Please do the last airbender or drsgon balll evolution
I didn't know you were a trekkie
Add Keanu Reeves and Marissa Tomei to the unaging hot af actors. Antonio Banderas too now looks older but he took a while too look his age. Even then he looks like 50 even tho hes 63
I found it weird that the trre house is "old" and wa built by machette WHEN they didn't even know machette was part of the family until after the first movie. Like how long time has passed since the first movie?
13:45 I heard this clip from SMG4
I know I've grown a lot as an empath when Carmen's 'IM SORRY' when they thought they were going to die made me tear up a little. Could you imagine if they actually died and those were the last words?
“They probably grew up in LA” brother every single one of Robert’s movies are in Texas 😂😂
Growing up in Texas with these movies was so funny cause it was just Six Flags with a bunch of fuckin cgi rides
When the flying pig came and caught the mcguffin, even at that point the spy kids/Girdy had no idea what the fuck was happening and was just as bewildered as everyone else
I can understand how the island man can hide the island. But what was stopping a non electrically powered ship from going in the direction of where the island is pointed on their GPS/tracker, and then once they were in the one mile radius where all electronics would have shut down, they could have still just continued going in the direction that they already were even if the can't see the island on their radar anymore. Plus, if it was only a one mile radius where the electronics would get shutdown/destroyed, I feel like from that distance, they would have been able to physically see the island from that distance, if not it's shore.
Kids having an existential crisis off of that one Steve buscemi quote. And if it wasn't the kids, it was the adults/parents watching with them that did. For a second there they have to check if this is a kids movie they stumbled into.
The more I think about it, the kids didn't drink that sleepy thing, making me think it was alcohol. Nobody wearing a suit, tie and shades should drink alcohol. Also, why would there be a party where every spy attends, giving bad guys a room full of their enemies?!
“Do you think god stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he’s created?” Even if this wasn’t a kids movie this would still be a loaded question for an adult movie
10:46 excuse me what is that username(😂)
7:37 everyone is going nighty night
Alex, your laugh is disgustingly contagious 😂
Spy kids 2 was my favorite one outa the three
Island of Lost Dreams was my favorite movie in this wacky franchise. one was just nightmare fuel and 3 was just dumb. I will say, though, the spider hybrid things, yeah that and crashing my bike into a black widows' nest when I was 12 is and was the reason for my arachnophobia. That and the spiders from Harry Potter. like no one needs to see that, get that s*it out of here.
16:28
why does juni talk like he is on bendadryl
All the top tier spies got duped and not having security camera that can easily fix the confusion 😂
<3
Amusement park mascot is great character design
4:40 I have that!
I lost it when this fever dream of a kids movie came with a deep mature quote "you think that God stays in heaven in fear of what he created" 😂
This movie was my preteen childhood! Best in the series!
I still have no idea how the fell into the poop like it was just during on the ground was there a whole 7bder the poop   Also that is a big ass pile of shit
13:41 And thus the greatest meme was spoken into existence.
Funny enough, the filming location for the beginning theme park scene was a park I went a lot to as a kid, I remember watching this movie and getting all excited when I recognized the rides in the background. (The park is Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington) Even after having long since moved away from that area, I still occasionally go back to that park like once or twice a year to re-live those memories…
I'm watching this while I build 40K figurines 😅
Famous ppl: used to be kids and smol  Alex: why are they so smol? 😂😂
Ever since this movie came out, I’ve never been able to shake the desire to have pocket sized wild animals hanging out in my room.
Then they made spy kids 4D all the time in the world.
2:17 nostalgia. Ohh the nostalgia
Justice for Junni
Nostalgia hit hard and then the reading rainbow theme played and the nostalgia doubled
Are we not going to talk about how Carmen gasps in her head when she's talking to Juni. As far as I know people don't do that.
What did Rheneas do to be in one of these videos? And why do people hate model railroads we just like trains okay.
The park being named "Troublemaker" is a kind of easter egg because that's the company that produced the movies
This sequel is the best kid movie sequel of our generation
"what do you think Jhonson? AHGEHAHG"
13:53   IM ACTUALLY SOBBING BAHAHA
11:05 "They found da poop." XDXD
He is a good YouTube movie explaining but he just hit the ground bottom on this one
Spy kids two was lit
This is the only Spy Kids movie where I didn't watch the whole thing (I watched the first two minutes). These movies are the most insane things I have ever seen, and I love them for it.
18:19 do you think the island of lost drems foreshadowed the cryptozoo scam or am i thinking too deep into this
Nostalgia
😂😂😂😂😂
That Kingdom Hearts comment at the beginning is the most accurate thing ever 😂😂
"Idk what do you think Johnson?" "DUHhhHhhHh" Took me OUT
Personally for me 2 is the one i skip to me its boring, dont get me started on 4 cause thats a train wreck
Kid logic, something is powerful and important, then it can blow up the world
😂
Kids have 500 IQ sometimes 🤯
yeah i dont think i wanna command a fleet ship because star something
Oh god, this unlocked so much of my childhood
THEY MADE ANOTHER ONE!!!! And by they I mean who else but Netflix
Okay but this was my go-to kid's movie growing up. only this one. i wanted to live on that damn island so bad you guys.  although i think that's why i liked james cameron's avatar so much.  but the bayverse transformers was my dad's fault, i swear
Please do Spy Kids 3 and 4
When u actually stop and watch the movie like (watch the movie) u can tell how ridiculous it is
We need salt kids 3
Hope you make a video about spy kids 3 — it’s even more ridiculous on a rewatch
Ironic. The guy wonders if god hides in fear if his creations. And that whole ocean scene with the suits happens…
I love Gina from Jane the Virgin and now, Not Dead Yet but I very much dislike her politics. I do like Zachary especially in Marvelous Mrs Maisel so I might play the movie to support them but I’m definitely not watching it. I refuse to ruin my childhood memories.
Bro hurry and do spy kids 3
I was so confused and still am about where did Gerty and Garry giggles came from
Spy Kids is still in my opinion still a masterpiece and is still with watching and re watching
The older I get the more I think that Juni was the best character. Honestly for the age he was meant to be- he was far more mature than his sister.
Why didn't you watch third part already? Do it before a reboot
I watched the spy kids movies a whole lot as a child, like it was probably unhealthy. I thought the second movie was a fever dream, like I knew it existed but I forgot the whole plot and like the secondary characters. After watching Gerti’s hair become a literal helicopter I can see why my brain just decided to block this movie out of my memory. This sounds like I'm saying this is a horrible movie. No, this is a artistic masterpiece, I'm just rambling about how I probably need to get my brain checked out.
Warhammer?
Uh uh him um  no words I just have no words
Uud
Uud
Cheese
Oh me oh my
Spy Kids 3 when?
Are we gonna get a spykids 3 video? Gotta complete the trilogy!
When are we getting the spy kids 3 video?
Alex, you should make videos on spy kids 3 and 4! I’m loving this series ❤
yea i had all 3 movies and then i watched them again as an older adult and ended up questioning why i loved and i threw them away even tho i had the cool 3d one it just they were weird and kinda dumb
Say what u will about Robert Rogriguez , but he makes the movies he wants to make!
Gerry and gurty have to be 1 foot tall because the the poop isn’t in a pit
DO SPY KIDS 3!!!! *ahem* please. and thank you. :)
Can you do the third spy kids movie?
I love this so much. I'm in a different boat because I missed 1 and 3 somehow and only watched 2 repeatedly lol
Do 3!
warhammer 40k refrence.
Maybe it wasn't a good idea to watch this at 5am high as a kite...
Family watches your vids but we honestly dont like the podcast name so cant get ourselves to support it . Also avoid the parts of the vids that discuss it . Other than that we like your posts in general.
So I always assumed that the island man was only in like Skype contact and donigan didn't know his actual location and that he was willing to sell his Jurassic Park animals, but not the transmuker device or the technology to make it, hence the tiny prototype.   But my biggest issue is that Alex completely overlooked the psychic cave and skeleton pirates fighting over gold with the "lost dreams" list, all those pre-existing structures that Romero did not build, it's a mystical depression title not a fairy tale Peter pan type deal, the potential for something greater broken by 'lost dreams'
Bill Paxton, Danny Trejo, Antonio Banderas, Steve Buscemi... one heck of a cast for a kid's movie.
This guy is just the epitome of Comedy the comedian of YouTube
I can’t not believe you skipped over the concert part😂
Where is part 3? WHERE IS PART 3?!?!
16:13 why does this give them permanent telepathy? id get it if the room was just weird and only worked in there but it even worked inside a video game.
Stop Alex I love your vids so much 😭
Try land before time, real classic the first movie traumatized most of the littles and was rather dark compared to the other movies
This movie was the best thing in the world back when I was 7 or 8. And i still watch it from time to time, yk just to feel like I'm 8 again. Also I'm watching young sheldon these days and my eyes popped out of my skull when I discovered that Gerty is Mandy like wow! This shit never gets old though lmao
5:27 LE GASP I WAS WATCHING MY DREAM WIFE THIS ENTIRE TIME?!
i loved these films as a kid and f it i still do they're silly but fun.
I wonder if Robert Rodriguez ever makes a and says yea this is kinda weird.
The President’s Daughter is played by the lead singer of the Rock Band “The Pretty Reckless.”
Istg they don’t get to the point until the last  30minutes😹😹
I have all 4 of these movies on dvd
Do you know how to squirrel? 😂
i was just thinking i wonder if he did one about sky high and then saw it on the list under the video lmfao
I laughed so hard that my laugh made me sub with post notifications
6:08 random Streets of Rage...
I haven’t seen any comments mentioning how Taylor Momsen is in this movie. She also played Cindy Lou Who in The Grinch and now she’s the lead singer of The Pretty Reckless.
Do spy kids 3 it’s like my favourite one
I'm high and this video makes this movie seem great.
Also, why didn't the secret agents just go up to save the presidents daughter? They had the gear for it but gave it to Juni and Carmen. And how could the magnet dude video call Donagan from the island? I thought all electronics stopped working from the Transmooker device
I he was like 15 his thought would be like: why is Jessica so smoking hot and cartmen would just be like what the fuuuuu...
I loved these movies as a teen, but I was old enough to have seen El Mariachi, Desperado, and From Dusk ‘Til Dawn… so I saw these movies as small passion projects for a guy who likes making home movies with his kids. I never thought about them as shining beacons of his career, so hearing you call them out as such made me do a double take.
Bro 11 months and 3D isn’t out yet?😳
Jariten
How does gurdy untangle her hair afterwards?
Please do Spy Kids 3D!!! We’re begging you! 🙏🏿
it makes sense if your a kid oke
My favorite part of Spy Kids was the McDonald's product placement.
Its so funny watching movies like this not knowing that a kid in the movie is someone famus you know but not realizing it. (Gerty) 😂
14:04 lol
These movies are so bad, it is painful to watch.
I’ve seen resident evil 4 this is least traumatic thing the president’s daughter will go through 3:49
13:39.
What’s wrong with the audio
So the President ate pieces of shit for breakfast?
16:28 when you see THIS at the foot of your bed and your regular sleep paralysis demons are like “THE HECK IS THAT? ME: 😭😭😭😆🤣🤣🤣🤣
The first one wasn't that bad as far as I remember but it's been a minute
Romero: “Do you think God stays in Heaven because he too lives in fear of what he’s created?”  Me: *imagines the past ten years I don’t know if that’s his reason, but it sure as hell would be mine.
11:05 hehehehe they fell in the 💩
Romero: do you think god stays in heaven cuz he too lives in fear of what he has created  Alex Meyers: daaaang that's deep bro
please dear god do the mess that is spy kids 3-d
Zendaya is mid
Honestly these films are a trip I’m convinced the writers were on acid or something
These movies are ass. There I said it.
Do spy kids 3
I know I'm late but I like how they all blame juni yet its not his fault its the adults fault.
Bro made me think about my life
Now watch spy family free you coward
This Spy Kids movie is my absolute favorite. It has its flaws but I love it
2:08 - Wait, that's Bill Paxton!
10:26 BIONICLE
13:45 one of the deepest quotes ever, and it comes from Spy Kids 2
But before that really quick
DID I HEAR WARHAMMER? I may not be gay but that’s worth a date
You think this is bad? Watch spy kids number 3 where children get kidnapped, launched off buildings, and much more! So watch it now.
everytime i hear the shining force 2 music it brings me back to playing the game with my dad as a child love hearing it in the wild like this
Spy kids 4 is a thing. Though it's existence is a tragedy
Mike Judge is in this? I knew I recognized that Butthead voice.
I would have loved if you did the third movie as well
I got a a prime ad for swarm right before the parents pass out 😂
Have you done spy kids 3
I swear that music in the beginning during the star trek ad, is from shining force 2 the village theme.
i felt bored with spy kids 2. 1 was fine and so was 3. when you said at the start of the video, that you haven't seen 2 and 3. did you know there was spy kids 4 all the time in the world. i thought spy kids 4 was better than 2.
How are you not going to mention how any of the gadgets were absolutely fantastic… like a thing that magically gives you Big Macs…
Steve Buscemi’s range will always frighten me… like the man was a firefighter and then he decided… hmmmm I’m gonna be an actor… what can’t he do…
Other people : when pigs fly Me: therein is
warhammer you say
Kingdom Hearts was cool but the story was confusing lol
Wait, if the government approves the use of child spies, doesn't that break at least one war crime
Best spy kids don't @ me  BUT...spy kids 3 slept on and be in that #1 spot has some areas that are questionable though also only 3D movie ever worth watching during that prime period
The part where the girl was flying had me in tears 😭😭😭😭
Didn’t even bring up machete
you not going to do a video for the third film?
Do the third one coward, you won't
Are you gonna make spykids 3d video?
I really dig how this Alex dude can be just sorta on the edge of what could be considered "clean comedy" but it doesn't come off as lacking in any way. He just has this accessible kinda silly but cynical thing that is the inoffensive without being child-like or pandering to anything. I appreciate that about this channel. Course, the content does make it easy to keep from going blue all the time, but it's still nice to know he can get all the jokes across without ever really worrying about demonetization or any of that.
Still one of my favorite childhood movies! I would never watch it again though just so it can remain a jem in my eyes.
10:26 Toa Gali in the background
I'm starting to think Alex has a thing for Sonic
did u never get around to doing a vid for spy kids 3 game over?, and if u do decide to do it, ik ur prob gonna questions all the cgi they use XD
man the original voice of this kid is horrible! he cant act for shit lol the dub actor did a waay better job whit the lines, this kid looks like he never acted a day before this lol,
3 was my favorite as a kid
Still waiting for the next parts
Spy kids 3 anyone?
Sorry guys i heard the transhooker device
Do spy kids 3
The President's daughter IS that lady from Gossip Girl, Taylor Momsen who's also in a rock band is also Cindy Lou Who in the Jim Carrey grinch
Spy kids 3? Did u cover it?
this is the worst of the spy kids
I remember watching spy kids 3 over and over and over again
13:20 spider monkey 😂 17:00 “ give it to me “ when pigs fly 😆
If the juggler was 40% realistic the riders innards wouldn’t support that much speed and force in such a spinning ride not only would they die they be like decomposed when the ride ends 2:22
Spy Kids 2 was completely insane...
Okay l write this here this little blonde girl is telor monsen. People who understand 😢 like this comment. Those who don’t ,, You make me wanna die I never be you and I you make me wanna die and every time I look inside your eyes, eyes. You make me wanna die,, Listen her music. The Pretty Recless
Rayman be like in 8:19
IM DYING AT 8:28
i just now realized donnagon is hank hills voice actor and now ill never unsee hank doing this
8:27 oh my goodness 😂😂😂
spy kids 2 “predicted” jeffrey epstein
The grandparents have pacemakers, that's why the transmooker could have killed them
Now I understand why I didn't understand wtf was happening there as a kid. But hey, cool gadgets right ?
It’s time for spy kids 3d
i watched im portuguese, in english jr was having a stroke the whole movie, i couldnt understand a word
I actually enjoyed this movie as a kid. But yeah, it truly is a ridiculous piece. 😂
do you think you can release 3 and 4?
Warhamer let’s gooooo I love man  it so cool
You should do spy kids game over. If you did the first two you might as well 🤷‍♀️😂
Ive actually never seen any of the other ones of these movies. Just this one about 100 times as a kid.
“I guess I was just to busy trying to understand just literally anything going on in Kingdom Hearts.” Extremely relatable, and also… makes a little to much sense knowing what you’re like, Alex.
"Emily Osment?? Was she born yesterday??" HAD ME ROLLING
Alex makes so many sonic the hedgehog jokes I’m starting to think he might be projecting
4:26 the reason why he sounded like that in that scene because he actually had a crush on the girl and he was a little nervous so instead of reshooting the whole scene they just went with
Hey where 3
I enjoyed the spy 2 movie. Good work on the video.
dang, using Six Flags Over texas, really good choice for an amusement park in a movie
okay but Spy Kids 3 is goated
am I the only one that thinks that the transmoker looks like the Game Theory logo?
We not gonna talk about the sus ass password of plowmesonic123 😂
Spy kids 3?
8:14 this girl is tails!
Not seeing the sequels as a kid was a crime lmao
Please make one for spy kids 3
When are you gonna do spy kids 3?
You forgot about the random skeletons that they just fight in the middle of the movie with no explanation of how they’re there or why they want to kill them😂
4:07 I think the reason Juni was so bland and calm during this conversation was because if he raised his voice at her, she would've gotten upset and possibly made the situation worse
Please do the other two. I'm especially curious how you'll do Spy Kids 4
wait a minute, the third spy kids movie isn’t the second one?? this whole time, I thought there was two. The first and the, i guess, third one. Like, I’ve never seen ANYTHING about the second one, yet have watched the first and third tirelessly
1:28 a ride only in Ohio
Could someone please tell me, cause I gotta know, what is that flute jingle at 12:25? And how do I get it?
8:31 tails?
YOU SKIPPED THE PART WITH THE BIG MONSTER FIGHT  THAT WAS THE BEST PART  DUDE CMON
actually, blonde kid, I remembered her solely becauseof the flying hair and that she was cute, nothing more nothing less
This is my favorite movie of the series.
"ur regular sleep paralisis demon"
Part 3?????????
Do Harriet the spy next
I love this channel! It's the only thing I love watching as much as my toddler because it's got plenty that make him laugh and so many jokes for me to enjoy that go over his head. It's amazing ❤️❤️
i watch your videos frequently and this is the best one by far
I know you mostly review tv and netflix shows....but since you reference it so much....why don't you do a "kingdom hearts doesn't make any sense" video? Sincerly, a girl in her mid 20's who just played KH 1&2 for the VERY first time this year
No one: Me at the eye doctor: 3:29
After seeing this, and knowing it’s the same guy who wrote multiple episodes of the Book of Boba Fett it’s quality makes a lot more sense.
16:20 The thought of something so f**ked up it even scares the paralysis demon...  🤣🤣🤣
I agree
Make a Star Wars video please pretty please pretty pretty pretty pretty please
Alex, I definitely do know how to squirrel.
Being a 40k nerd and seeing that random line makes me very proud
this made me laugh so hard
Crazy how Juni is married to Megan Trainor now…
The animation makes this channel.  Their eyeballs and lips...  I just can't stop laughing at it  I subbed after watching the "Mean Girls 2" video. That movie* was so hilariously retarded.
This movie could have been over in 5 minutes if they hadn't blamed Junie
Can we just take a moment to appreciate that HANK FREAKING HILL was the villain in this? Rewatching this as an adult really opens the eyes
I know I’m late to the party but, I loved the reference to Warhammer 40k
The full video time was coincidently the same year we are in now
I swear— this was actually my favorite movie when I was a kid. Spy kids 2.
You know, every time I hear you rep your podcast called "doing the devil's tango," I can't help but imagine like the most PG13 softcore porn video, lol. Like literally a porn produced by the "cool mom" who wants her kids to explore their sexuality but safely, you know, in a Disney friendly way haha
LMFAO you make me laugh at things that weren't funny to me before LMFAO "sleepers"
Spy kids gave me fever dreams as a kid.  I also think these types of movies may have been partly to blame for the fact that I can't track the plot in a lot of movies as an adult since I apparently learned as a kid that the plot is not followable anyway
did we never get spykids 3 we need the video
11:02 11:02 11:02 11:02 11:02 11:02
11:01 11:01 11:01 11:01 11:01 11:01
There’s a spy kids 4 with joel mchale and jessica alba 😂😭 it’s even worse than 2 and 3  speaking of nuts ass kids movies, y’all ever seen the thomas the tank engine movie with alec baldwin? it’s called smth like thomas and the magic railroad. it’s absolutely cracked 🤡
I don't think I've ever laughed so much with one of your videos.
My name is Apple Cider and I will be reporting this for hate speech.
This movie is literally my childhood!
Is no one gonna mention fucking Mike Judge is in this movie?
what would God be scared of flying helicopter hair?
I just found out that gertie is played by emily osment. Emily osment plays a pretty big role in the big bang theory spin-off ”young sheldon”. It’s a good show.
I'm so excited for his video on Spy Kids 3. It's an absolute masterpiece and there hasn't been a movie so great since it came out. A full 1 hour 24 minutes of pure pleasure. Make sure to watch for everyone to be slipping around on the ground like it's melted butter and the way things slide around in everybody's hands proves that friction doesn't exist in virtual reality. And you can tell they probably just blew like 70% of the budget just on getting Sylvester Stallone in the movie so by the time they paid all the special effects artists they had to have been like oh crap we have no budget left, well let's just have all the known adult actors jump into frame for a second and then skip the fight scene and have everyone act like they won the fight and no one will notice. Yeah it's absolutely amazing. It walked so that Sharkboy and Lavagirl could run
I love how just changing the teleprompter actually takes away their dad’s promotion
This movie had the greatest McDonalds happy meal tie in of all time.
Spy kids 3 review? ⏳🤷🏾‍♂️
Make a video of spy kids 3
you are easily amused.
Missed the funniest Parts where Gerny rats out her dad to her mom that he's trying to take over the world again.
7:38 is how I’m trying be after sipping my NyQuil
Rob Rod directed some of the Book of Boba Fett and its VERY noticeable lol
Where, prey tell, is the third movie breakdown?
Plot doesn't matter its just an excuse for them to do cool shit thats it
7:36 what version of the  film are you watching? None of this is the soundtrack originally in the film lol
The music that starts at 17:55 sounds like bad romance
So I don’t usually comment but for what it’s worth, I feel as a kid, watching this movie planted the seeds for a whole genre of exploring the unknown and opening your mind to the idea things might not always make sense, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a science behind it. Even just the room they can hear each others thoughts in, I can’t help even as an adult, asking questions in this fantasy world and the fact it’s never explained really allows the mind to fill in the gaps and make it better. Idk just my 2 cents, loved these movies as a kid and always had a soft spot for this movie for having such outlandish concepts
Game over, man!
God dam, it's crazy how to kid brain works, cause I remember this being SO FUCKING COOL, and watching these scenes now they are nothing like I remember.
If you knew nothing about god, people or heaven, you’d think it was deep. If you did, you got a good laugh
Please give us Spy Kids 3!! 😂
Sk3?!?!??
Mr. giggles is Mike Judge. The man who made king of the hill and Beavis and Butthead
where is part 3 👀👀
Spy kids 3D needs to be unpacked
Still love it doe
The best part of the movie is the song in the end lol
I never realized that was Cindy-Lou Who until now.
Why do all the secret service agents look like a slightly older terminator
That KH reference was so relatable because I was so into it lol but I also went to see the movie when it was released lol I can't believe we used to go to the movies without parental supervision. Jesus fuck! 😂  Also, I just recently started KH3 lol
I was pretty sure I had seen the first two Spy kids movies. But im even more sure I would never forget watching this.
Where is Spy Kids 3 at ma boy
If you think you're going to talk sh1t of the best movie ever made and get away with it, you're right, because Idk where you live.
I'm glad I'm not the only one that rewatched this movie as an adult and legit felt the story was like a fever dream when it comes to plot consistency. The entire plot of the movie made pretty much no sense and had no justification for ANY of it to even happen. Old dude wanted to be in charge of the OSS and use the device in order to have a secret base entirely off the map to store whatever? Sure, he already hacked the prompter announcing the promotions(because apparently promotions are entirely secret to absolutely everyone and revealed in some awards show style announcement...) and employed the guy who designed it. What did he need to put all the agents to sleep for? What was there to be gained to have some mission to retrieve said device? How did he get all of these minions and stuff as a normal agent?
"Do you think that God hides in Heaven because he too fears what he created?" has no right being a quote in Spy Kids 2
idk, the plot doesn't make a lot of sense but it seems like a fun kids movie
Please do spy kids 3 its the best of the three (4 is awful)
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i remember there being a spy kids 4
Spy kids 9
Wow to think the president's daughter just went and joined a rock band  (If you don't know what I'm talking about, the girl playing the president's daughter is Taylor Momsen, singer of the pretty reckless)
I always lose it every time he gags lol
Damn a Warhammer 40k reference
i have watched the movie like athousand times and still dont get it
How long until spy kids 3 and 4
Sins exist for a reason you know
The director wanted to shoot the amusement park scene at DisneyWorld and to use Mickey ears instead of what they actually used
i love this name  carmen elizabeth rohanita echo sky brava cortez  it sounds so wavey
My favorite scene is when they’re in the volcano just chilling in mid fall waiting to die.
“You’re regular sleep paralysis demon”. 😂
16:32
I never realized Emily Osmond had been in more things than ant farm until I saw her in supernatural and then now I see she's in spy kids and im even more shocked bc I thought she was only popular for that role😅I need to look into her bc apparently she had been acting a while before ant farm
Cant wait for your review of spy kids 3 😂
Im surprised you didn't mention the bug toy junie had. Them toys were everywhere back in the day
I've always loved the mama!
Oh dear, this is nostalgic.
14:00 JUST BROKE ME
The best thing about this movie was that Mike Judge, Hank Hill, Beavis and Butthead starred as Donovan Giggles (if you know, ya know).
That ain't a giggle,, it sounds like someone pretending to be a flute without opening there mouths.
f you, 4:24 i almost started choking on my food
I thought this whole series was a wery bad fever dream...
Lmaooooooooo this video had me rolling
I love war hammer 40k
Spy kids 3 was very strange for no reason . To be honest some of the video game stuff made it the most like shark boy and lava girl .  And spy kids 4 was just wierd , I'd love to hear your take on both
I recommend Spy Kids 3, it was my favorite! 😄
I cant wait for him to do spy kids 3
playing the helicopter meme makes it better 8:15.🤣😂🤣😂
I have seen thr first and third Spy Kids movies hundreds of times, but somehow I have never seen the second one? ANyway Spy Kids 3 is top tier.
If your hater shut up cuz if you hate the channel then don’t watch it that simple
Another great video dude keep up the good work
That part where he said"  why do they despise me I crested them?" Then the whoa bro part with the butterfly in the sky song.  Sister snd I lost it replayed it over and over on TV 😂😂😂
SPY KIDS 3!
This is one of the worst movies I thankfully have never seen
Looks like they dont knew how radar works.
@3:14 tbh kinda butthurt you didn't reference Leon S. Kennedy
You Sir deserved yourself a like with that random kingdom hearts name drop
Fun fact: The OSS from Spy Kids shares the same name as the OSS from world War 2, which were also the pre cia spies.
We just glossing over the sea/water dragon? Okay then
The content really attracts viewers, it’s amazing 💕🤩
“ im a helicopter 🚁 “ 🤣🤣🤣
As a kid, i thought that spider-monkey-thing was the coolest thing ever. Only after rewatching years later i noticed how uncanny it looks. Still like a lot though.
Kids named “apple cider” & “Pepto Bismal” 😂
The secret service dude pushing all the buttons on the control panel 😂 then juni “coming back from the dentist” 🤣
Watch the new spy kidssss
Is that Shooter McGavin?
what about 3 and 4
I always thought that Gary’s giggle was actually Carmen’s giggle when she found out they were talking about her and her brother
I remember really liking the musical number in the credits. I had a bit of a crush on Alex Vega.
I forgot Taylor Momsen was in this movie. ( the president's daughter, who also plays Cindy Lou Who in The Grinch w/ Jim Carey and Gossip Girl....she's currently the lead singer of The Pretty Reckless. big fan of her band ) all I remember of this movie is that they're on an island and competing against two other kid spies and there's little dinosaur creatures and then that song Juni and Carmen do at the end.
You should watch in a logical way. Then you'll understand all. Not from a perpective of a another show or just a movie. Open your mind a little bit more on the logical part. Wink wink
Oh god monk was fired
I hear you! The Kingdom Hearts story got us all sucked in!
I’d love to see you do Agent Cody Banks!
"Do you know how to Squirrel?"
Spy Kids 3 was everything to me. And, there was the website where you could play games. If you went to McDonald's back in the days, you could get the toys for Spy Kids 3 and it came with codes for the web game. It was honestly everything. Oh the memories.
Pretty pretty pleaseeee do Spy Kids 3 game over ❤
I only remember this movie cause of the McDonald's happy meal toy at the time combined into this frog thing that i really wanted as a kid after that i dont remember shit
Where’s number three ???? 😢
Omg that transmieuajskskg is a goddamn clutch for my car! Give me!
14:00 I CANNOT BREATH LMFAO
You never mentioned, Gerty looks like a Gender-bend version of Malfoy.
Dude please do spy kids 3 it's 100 times crazier!!
I'm a big kingdom hearts fan
I had no idea that was Mike Judge! After watching KOTH though, that voice is unmistakable
@ 13:44 that shit killed me bro 💀  WHOAH DUDE
8:35  No wonder Juni quit  Toxic ass work environment
the God quote got me thinking tho
10:00 CC says "junior rocky racer rebel cortes"
I've seen spy kids 2.. and I've frequently heard that Steve Buscemi quote...... I only just realized that it was a quote from Spy Kids 2...... o.o
That reading rainbow SENT ME I'm dying
Lol. I'm still lost at what the hell is even going on ,in kindoms hearts games  !🤔
Are you insulting war hammer players? How dare you
8:18 helicopter helicopter
8:32 helicopter helicopter
I wanted to be a Spy Kid so bad 🥲🤣
3 please
As a ride operator if u don’t have the key u can’t use the control panel
11:14 I was eating when i watch this "was"
Buscemi rules!
With all the times you mention Sonic fanfic, are you ok Alex?
11:15 thats when i died of laughing come on did you hear him
Idk y but I'm in love with the use of the old mario jingle in the background lol
9:55 when i was a kid i thought he was saying something super Spanish but the actor couldn't enunciate
There's this running joke in my class about one of my classmates being the president's daughter because her father owns a lot of land in my town and this video reminded me of that.
I CAMT WAIT. FOR. GAME. OVER
I used to love this movie as a kid! It was on repeat all the time
Hey man, all I can think about is my warhammer 40k figurines..
Can you do the other two soon?
Wheres the spy kids 3 video at?
'OHHHHH'
16:27 I legitimately don't have sleep paralysis demons, but rather sometimes wake up with my dream mind still kinda going and see strange or enlarged insects or arachnids either on my pillow or hovering above me, so this is exactly the type of creature I could wake up to 😂
I wnjoyed being in spy kids 4,and the new spy kids reboot .
0:00- 0:02 *Lum's flying sfx intesifies*
13:45 17:50 her slow nod lol
Am I the only person that remembers the spy kids movie with the volcano and scientist?
I've seen the 1st and 3rd but have  no memory of this one somehow
Are you going to watch spy kids all the time in the world?
Woah is that Kahn from hit game call of duty advanced warfare exo zombies?!
I love it when you stand on the pole with it in your mouth it looks so painful and funny
I never realized this was six flags over texas 😂😂😂😂lmaoo
I love that the Cortez family is Latino, which made me and my bigger sister closer to Carmen and Juni
IM NOT A TREKKIE ALEX! LONG LIVE STAR WARS!!!!!!!!!👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾 💀💀💀
Vintage Buscemi chompers…he got them fixed later. His old teeth looked like an abandoned cemetery.
I watched these the other day and the only one that feels like you’re not of this world is 3 what the hell was that movie lol I always remember the giant robot fight, it was so out of place like everything else 😂
nice
9:48
I think the Netflix TV show you are referring to is the animated version. it is 3D animation it is actually a pretty good and cute story that is easy to follow that definitely falls in line with the movies
Recently found your channel. I love movies, and I still own/watch these movies I grew up with. You're pretty entertaining at recapping these movies lol.
I really liked this one as a kid, I just thought the creatures were cool.
I have a lot of 40k figurines
Koolest movie ever. You forgot to mention the Shooter McGavin cameo.
you have to watch WENDY WU! It is one of those trash teen movies that you only watch at 1 am when there is literally nothing else to see right after teen beach 2. so made for your reaction lul! XD
And now this reminds me who in the hell would name their daughter Gerti?  And now looking back at Spy Kids 3 and knowing what their mother looks like I could only imagine they got all their looks from their dad. 🤣😂🤣😂
Cant help but notice secret service has no issue with random guy touching the presidents daughter
Rodriguez also made another weird movie called "Shorts". It was the weirdest by far
nice
i never actually watched this one, i remember it coming out, but after the first one, and i was a bit older at this time, i chose not to, man these films were weird though...
4:22 im dying
4:10 lol
12:14 it basically the endless pit from gravity fall well this movie was before gravity falls even existed soo ya it like that
0:31 - 1:27 if Sheldon from the big bang theory found this he would love it
This movie cracked me up
6:07 excuse me if you're date plays 40k that ain't your date anymore that's your husband
was...was that tony shaloub???
So the guy who created Beavis and Butt-Head and king of the Hill, Mike Judge, was Donnagon Giggles.
I can't wait for the Alex Meyers Never Have I Ever review...
What about spy kids 3d?
Alex this video had me crying of laughter. Absolutely spot on.
I remember seeing the movie in theaters and every parent freaked out when "shit" was said in a kids movie.
I watched it when I was 4 lol
Spy Kids 2 is awesome because their grandfather is Khan.
I remember loving Spy Kids 1, 2, and 3
Lolz I love how the tech McGuffin was called the "transmooker device"
What do you do for a living?  I watch shows and movies.  Wha- I watch movies.  And how do you make money I watch movies.
Cool, funny, & entertaining movie review video.
13:40 hit me so hard when I was 13 years old, I filled an entire journal with my writings about how I felt like God had abandoned me, abandoned all humans, and that religion is endlessly flawed in its search for life’s purpose. Looking back on that, it seemed very Nietzsche inspired, but really it was Spy Kids 2 that inspired my agnosticism
You gotta do the 3rd one now, there is a forth if you'd call it that. No words I'll let you decide 👌
Bruh you missed the bit where one the waiters offers children alcohol
I didn't care for this movie but you best reviewed the third one for one one Pacific thing which I remember the ending of the third movie which was awesome
Why did this movie make sense when I was a kid lol 😂
I loved the second one as a kid. The third one is the bad one, it was too childish even for me with the videogame plot. I consider Spy Kids 2 to be in the same camp as the Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters film, seeing as I could totally see a couch tomato video with those 2 films.
And your regular sleep paralysis demon is like “ da heck is that” that delivery was so good i laugh so hard
have you ever noticed the presidents daughters front teeth look kinda like buck teeth, or is it just me
Ed-ward? 13:16
Do spy kids free next
nobody's talking about Spy Kids 4, huh... not that I blame 'em
Good thing I eat all my dinner before even thinking of drinking cause I wouldn't get knocked the fu*k out.
plowmesonic123? That's amazing, we have the same pass... I mean, jesus the fuck?
Jesus loves you guys!!
where the expletive is le spy kids 3 video
I remember being like 8 or 9 years old watching Spy Kids 2 for the first time and actually thinking that the theme park in the opening scene actually existed.
this was a trip, yeah
6:04 me 😳
I remember having a huge crush on carmen when I was like 7 lol Great childhood memories
0:00 cute
The boy spy kid is not a good actor LMAO he does sound like he just came from the dentist ROFL
I fucking loved these movies growing up
Watching these was like having a good fever dream
😂😂😂 video to funny
These movies will always be my guilty pleasure. They're so bad, but I enjoy them so so much
The monkey spider is in fact Robert Rodriguez’s 4 am sleep paralysis demon!
And in Illinois everybody’s last name is Sullivan!
Fun fact: The president's daughter is played by Taylor Momsen who also played in the live-action grinch movie. She now has a rock band called the Pretty Reckless.
2:08 RIP Bill Paxton
I loved these movies, one and three the best, mostly because this one always felt like a fever dream and I legitimately wondered if I had imagined most of it for a while. Nope. It's really that weird. Still kinda fun though!
It’s just fun to watch, that’s why people like it— not cuz the plot line is very incredible or something
Rip June
Spy Kids 2 officially turns 20 today! I remember my sisters and I saw it at the Inlet theater in the Adirondacks  Still my fav sequel in the series Action is better, more visual gags, and more gadgets add to the gimmicky effects  Love how they brought in Gary & Gerti (my first introduction to Emily Osment pre-Hannah Montana), Steve Buscemi, and the late Ricardo Montalban as Grandpa Cortez  I totally didn't recognize the late Bill Paxton's cameo  The plot is really messy and convoluted but it allows the characters to grow proving they can be capable secret agents  Odd there was a line in here this was the time and place to seed a crisis of faith in the hearts of kids everywhere, but you gotta applaud Robert Rodriguez's audacity Who knew Alexa Vega could sing too?
Spy kids 2 was my favorite of the franchise
I greatly regret that this film was my introduction to Steve Buscemi
she turned into an attack helicopter
oh Spy Kids movies were 1000% a fever dream no matter how many times you watched them. they are amazing, but I can't imagine whoever wrote them wasn't on LSD, cocaine and mushrooms altogether when doing so. and still its pretty unbelievable they reached this level of weirdness.
where 3
Gonna be waiting for spy kids 3&4
Spy Kids 2 was and still is my favorite Spy Kids movie second is the 3rd one and last one is the 1st one
The juggler gave me nightmares as a kid
D
I've only just watched this but I'm laughing so hard 🤣
the island boy became a man.
i was obsessed with these movies back then. as well as dcom
Dude, is it just me or you sound just like Sokka from Avatar
Girti’s pigtails spinning  Me: Helicopter!
I know it’s suppose to be funny and ironic but it’s really not… 😒
I was waiting for his reaction to “Do you think that God hides in Heaven because he too fears what he created?”   Honestly, I was expecting a little bit more but I am just grateful I got something
11:15 I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT PART WAS SO DISGUSTING OML- GLAD SOMEBODY POINTED IT OUT!
I'm Still Waiting for Spy Kids: All The Time In The World But Anyways, I Love Your Vids Since I was 7 And Keep Up the good work :)
the giggles were definitely added in post and sound nothing like the giggle siblings and clearly aren't coming from them... why... children are able to giggle
It’s all about sonic. sonic IS everywhere
Can’t wait to see him do spy kid 3 if he think 2 is weird
13:36 Parenthood
Unrealistic that no adult at the party just doesn't drink, or fake drank because they're too picky about their drinks, or fake drank because they're spies, and are paranoid about EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. Like if the kid knew she could just swiped her finger over the glass to know that there were "sleepers" there, why didn't an adult do that before drinking?
Ha ha they fell in spaghetti  Ha ha they fell in poop  😂😂
Carmen and Juni's family didn't just randomly show up to the island tho. They were informed by Donnagon that their kids took the Ukata assignment and went missing, and they went to go find them.
he meant something else when he said something about a talk, he meant the talk
Love this movie 🍿🍿
I'm sorry....you mean to tell me...that the iconic God in heaven line...is from fucking SPY KIDS 2????
damn, that kingdom hearts joke hit me hard.
holy shit bill paxton was in this?!!!!!!!
Chick with the hair could defeat Thanos
11:02 COME ON I WAS EATING! 😖
does anyone else not remember this one as much as the others? 1, 3, & i think even 4 i can recall but I don't feel familiar with 2 at all
I remember being like 9 years old thinking Gerti was bad as hell
What about Spy kids all the time in the world? It was even worse to be honest, and I'd love to hear your opinion on it.
I never knew there was a Spy Kids 4 until I watched this video. You should watch that one and spy kids 3.
It is totally insane. That’s why I love it so much. 🤣
Why is this my favorite Steve Buscemi movie though?
I remember babysitting my neighbors kids and they were into this. I was a teen thinking "man, these kid movies are weird", then I remember Pee Wee's Big Adventure. I have no room to judge.
I didn’t realise that the president’s daughter was Taylor Momsen.. but i guess it fits because this movie does Make Me Wanna Die  😌
Who names their kid donagon
Is it just me or has Alex Meyers become funnier
This was one of my favorite movies as a lil dude
Honestly these movies were probably terrible (I have fond memories of both spy kids 2 and 3 but never saw one) but you’ve gotta give them credit for the creativity and goofiness behind it. Sure it’s probably just acid induced but they had some pretty interesting ideas and the premise behind a James Bond for kids is clearly pretty present. All of the gadgets and powers make sense for kids, especially the helicopter ponytails
Spy kids 3 was even more of a product of its time. I don’t care though, they all have their own charm
My man I was just having a blast this movie is like an hour long shitpost
I watched this movie nonstop as a kid 💀
You just reminded me of rocket power do rocket power!
I didn't know his sleep paralysis demon sounded like Meowth
I love how the art style just completely improved
I have another movie that doesn't make much sense. 'Max Magician and the Legend of the Rings'. Definitely not at all a reference to 'The Lord of the Rings'. If you do check it out, I apologize in advance for your suffering.
Can you watch spy kids 3 haha
Spy kids 2 was my favorite of the 3 movies for some reason lol I have the most nostalgia for it
After he  mention Sharkboy and Lavagirl I remember that they made adult version of that and I remember people saying it sucked
they had to save the presidents daughter in order for her to make Pretty Reckless
The cast of this movie(besides the kids) is umbeliveble, like their father that is Antônio bandeiras
Also, Shiit-ake mushrooms
The Reading Rainbow part was hysterical 🤣👍🏻👍🏻
My new favorite reviewer. You just earned another subscriber.
Doohickey. That's the best word to come up with for anything scientifically related.
Jesus loves you he is always There by your side he will never leave you nor forsake you Repent from your sins while you still have time in the mighty name of Jesus Christ AMEN
12:25 "I have been falling for 30 minutes!"
Buscemi brought it though. Do you think God stays in heaven because he lives in fear of what he's created? Bars.
This animation totally has Urusei Yatsura vibes I love it!
Can you please do Spykids 3 and 4?
Granted its been a very very very long time since i've seen spy kids 2, but I never realized Emily Osment was in it
Wait I SWEAR this is the movie with the clones
And Zendaya is like a year older than me 😂 I STILL can’t believe it        13.7.22
How did I miss this video 😂        13.7.22
Can you do spy kids 4 and 3
At one point, I thought I was actually watching the movie until I heard Alex say “Hehehe they fell in spaghetti” and “Hehehe they fell in de poop” and I started laughing and couldn’t stop repeating it
BILL PAXTON WAS IN THIS?!?
Lol 🤣 I honestly couldn’t tell you hwhy…
nah this is by far your funniest video to date 13:40
Man didn't even address Chad Dylan Cooper XD
these movies didn't age well at all, ever the "newer one" is bad
Pls do spy kids 3
Transmooker? It transmooks…..as in it mooks them differently or makes them mook?
This movie makes me not sad that I missed these movies
Spy Kids 2 was my favorite of the three lol
Spy Kids 2 was my favorite!
Is Alex Meyers gay?
The remake I actually really enjoyed when I was younger
Wait a sec! When was this filmed? 2:07 is clearly Mr. Freeze and Batman the Ride from Six Flags Over Texas.  My real question is, how much money did they spend editing out Gotham City in the park or was this filmed WAY EARLY
My favorite Spy Kids movie, love the Carmen song at the end too.
Watch stranger things season 4 volume 2
alex there’s a 4th spy kids
I like the new genie animation 😃
Side note, but Carla Gugino is a hot, timeless queen and I loved her in Gerald's Game.
I would pay money to hear him comment on the barbie movies.
I gotta say, I always loved all the spy kids movies for how entertaining and funny they were for me as a kid, and while I remember scenes and moments, I couldn’t recall ANYTHING from the main plot for most of them even if my life depended on it.
this movie made me gag as a child.
Trying to figure out what is going on with kingdom hearts at a small age is such a small detail yet such a great understatement. Loved it
6:05 I feel called out
How Gerty didn't end up suffering from traction alopecia from those helicopter pigtails is the most unrealistic part of the movie for me.
I always think who in their right mind would name their daughter gerti
Where is the Spy Kids 3 video?
So spy kids 3 next
I’ve watched this movie so many times as a kid and man, it’s still confusing…
13:19 let me find out you know about data and megaman legends! I knew I subscribed for a reason lol
i feel like Rodriguez just did some drugs and needed money for more
I love spy kids 3 its so dope
This a ridiculous movie.
I can describe the movie easily, a Fever dream written by a madman who has done, ALL of the drugs, even the stuff that hasn't been invented yet.
I felt the Kingdom hearts comment on a personal level
13:44  what the hell is happening right now???
8:27    8:34 Welcome to the Alex-Meyers-sounds-kinda-like-Tim-Allen portion of the video
Spy kids 2 is probably my favorite of the 3 movies.
The first one is absolutely the best. I watched all the 3 movies recently.
As someone who's never watched Spy Kids before this is wack
Nice catch pointing out the President's daughter being Jenny Humphrey from Gossip Girl.
2:07 LONG LIVE BILL PAXTON!!!!!!!!! BEST STORM CHASER IN THE WORLD
11:05😂😂😂
this movie series (yes even 4) holds a place in my heart for well being actually fun to watch. Also "Danny Trejo" is kind of a national treasure in my eyes
"dO yOu KnOw HoW tO SqUiRrEl
SPY KIDS 2 ISLAND OF LOST DREAMS The best one
I never realized that the president in this movie was shooter mcgavin
Okay, when are you doing spy kids three?
I forgot how goofy this movie was. I still love it tho.
11:10 honestly when I was younger I thought she said “SOMEONES GONNA PEE!” and now it’s a running joke in my family…
why is the OSS so easy to hack?!
I love how amazingly insane these movies were, there's just nothing else quite like them.
ik this sounds kind of crazy (or you might even believe me) but my dad worked on the movies not a huge amount but he is a production designer and he used to work on movies like these! he made some props for the movies!
When the thumbper' has a dumper 👀
I remember that I appreciated the fact that the first two parts were incredibly stylish and fashionable for early 2000s. I wanted to have those clothes that Carmen wore - they had kinda badass vibes. And the fact that most colours in the first two parts were black/red/brown but not Disney-ish bright blue/pink/green made this movie look more serious and "for adults". All the gadgets looked real because of the design and when I was a child and I played X-files with my friends, I imagined real guns and scary monsters that could kill us any minute. And Robert Rodriguez seemed to take kids seriously but at the same time he found a way to make it silly and funny for his viewers. I remember being disappointed and irritated by many kids movies in my childhood because at some point you start to feel as if those movies see morons and idiots in kids.  Robert Rodriguez managed to avoid that.
Alexa Vega is a family vlogger on YouTube, no joke
Yoo good vid
You noticed little J but you didn’t get little Selena!!!!!  I remember I still enjoyed the second but far away from the first one and I lost at the third one.
The third is even weirder but i still watched them as a kid
Lol
All of these movies are absolute trips. 😆
Kingdom Hearts you say?
What's with the audio in the movie? Lmao
When you're trans and only smoke mooks, I AM the transmooker
Hey can u do a review of the movie antboy big fan
Looking back, this movie was full of shitake mushrooms.
Alex big fan of ur reaction videos of the movies and tv series.  I admire the animation.  Make Spy Kids 3D   Lmao XD  8:19 and 11:16 had me dying laughing. I'm rolling.
i have never seen a movie with worse acting than the spy kids movies - and i have seen some pretty bad movies apart from excpet  carla gugino who imo is  a good actress
do the boys!!
I once refused to get laid because spy kids was on tv. This was 2 years ago. I’m 25..  and it was fucking worth it!
I wasn’t even born when this movie came out 👁👄👁 It was released on August 7, 2002 I was born in 2007 😭
I actually enjoyed Spy Kids 3D… but I think what I enjoyed most was how, in Spy Kids four, Juni is an independent agent and the best in the world… and Karmen, whose always been the top OSS agent is completely overshadowed by him… 😊
i could tell he didnt watch it all, even as a kid i understood the movie and his line about the parents makes no sense cause not even halfway through we had scenes of them searching for the kids, he makes it sound like they just appeared. please dont claim a movie or anything really is dumb and doesn't make sense if you are skipping parts, its like you got a puzzle threw 1/3 of the pieces through the window then decree how the puzzle is bad cause you cant finish it lmao
These movies are so goofy 😅😄.
She's the same actress from gg and the lead singer of the pretty reckless
Isn't it just a kicker that the kid who played Junie has a kid with Megan trainer
Spy kids 3?
Bruh, people sayin this shit a kids movie up until fuckin “do you think god stays in heaven because he too fears what he has created?”. That line is definitely one of the reasons for my fuckin existential crisis at age 8
You should do Kingsmen...
the amount of times Alex mentions sonic makes me think he has impure sonic thoughts.
i love spy. i am a russian spy
You definitely overdid it with the adult jokes in this one. Usually you place them really well and they're a bit of a shocker but they were just all over here and got old. Would have liked to see more of your usual balanced humor. Other than that, wonderful job with the animation as usual and take care!
Hello amazing people
This brought me joy
I want to see a reaction to Spy Kids 3: Game Over. Enough said.
I love your videos bro! Enough said.
Now he has to do spy kids 3
Spy Kids 2 was the best of the franchise
I actually saw this before I saw the first one. Loved it 😂
There is a forth one
This is the movie where the clip comes from
Why is it SpICyYyyY
The whole Spy Kids franchise makes less than no sense.
alright Alex, you had me good there with the sleep paralysis demon. That floored me
I think the marketing is what made these movies.
4:26, nailed it, first take
I liked the movie but never really understood the whole power grab that the rival children and their dad had and how their mother is apparently someone you want and your good side
8:18 alex just realized the fever dream he was in, & loved it.
Your animation style is pretentious, and hypocritical. I also didn’t like the movie, but god, some of you YouTubers act like the movie crawled out of the screen and abused you.   But hey, as long as you get money for making a sub par product, and just a hint, I’m not just talking about spykids 2.
I like how Robert Rodríguez movies are like his homemade family movies with effects. He didn't make Spy Kids for the money or the art, but because his children enjoy them... I don't know his current situation right now
I’ve heard the quote ‘does God stay in heaven because he too fears what he created’ and always assumed it was from some novel, but no, it’s from spy kids 2
“We drank something without running it through security as this is a very important event, it’s this kids fault!”
“Ahh crap, I hacked into the cia, now I’ll never get to worship our lord and savior khorne!”
Did this movie accidentally gives us the origin story of Spliced?
Spent 20 minutes trying to fuigre out what the background music for the ad was only to find out its from my FAVORITE GAME SEIRES SHINING FORCE an f now I feel like an idiot
We are forgetting the bigger picture Juni is the reason why Michael Myers is a thing
I've been waiting for this! Woo!
Y r all the comments paragraphs
Can't wait till spy kids 3.
NOW U BETTER DO SPY KIDS 3
You need to watch this movie about a human sized cat that hangs with these kids and takes them to a wonderland. It's called cat in the hat
Please react to Big time rush, Kickin'It, Lab rats, The bee movie, Monster vs Alien and Phineas and ferb
That god quote is literally too deep for this movie and I love that it’s in it haha 😂
lol do sharkboy and lava girl. if you haven't. loved this movie as a kid 😂
The entire spy kids series was a fever dream
Totally forgot about the second one kinda hits different
B
That Steve buscemi lone was WIIILD
11:50 did everyone have these glasses? Lol
it really was pretty ridiculous, as a kid watching these movies I thought nothing of it, it looked really cool and I thought "what if that shit was real, you can actually go into video games and play the game that way" but rewatching the movie and watching TRON thats a bad idea
Spy kids 3!!!!!
That we can be heros movie  whatever it's called reminds me of spy kids and it was only made a couple years ago
man do i love makeup o shoot i just hired a hit man
That plowmesonic123 made me blow water through my nose
Steve Buscemi just has that range to act in children's movie and just be the greatest thing about it
Now revisiting this movie, That entire camel scene wanted to make me throw up. Also those pigtails were wiping, I bet at least 75% of girls wanted pigtails that could make them fly after that.😅😄👀😖
this movie was kinda my whole childhood lmao
Kinda unrelated but when I was watching a yt short they compared the resemblance of Gerty and first year Draco Malfoy 😭
Did you guys know there's a Spy Kids 4?? Can we talk about that abomination of a movie it was?
Yeah man   INSANELY COOL
Do you know how to squirrel is my new catchphrase
Did anyone else kinda forget spy kids 2 existed?, well I knew it was a thing but I forgot what it was even about or I just never saw it and just skipped to spy kids 3
1:40 does anyone else here the n word
How come the other spy kids never try to back up and defend Judi when he was blamed
I just thought gary was cute
These movies were so good precisely because they were the extension of our wildest imaginations as kids. Which as adults feel like a warped fever dream X'D But hey, they sure did make us dream big dreams as kids X'D
Hey man please do THE SUMMER I TURNED PRETTY, it's written by the author who wrote TO ALL THE BOYS IV'E EVER LOVED BEFORE its on Prime Video
“Ah yes, smells like Benadryl” - actually the peak of comedy right there… 😂
I COMPLETELY forgot the first half of the movie BECAUSE it had zero relevance to the rest of the plot xD
Do you know how to squirrel
WAAAAAAAAAIT if a plane flys over that island... OH GOD
I really only remember watching this once but I do remember shipping Juni and Alexandra. Juni is soooooo stupid
Algorithm pokes spy kids
I loved Spy Kids 2 so much, that movie is so freaking awesome, I mean looking back at it now the cgi in it is pretty dated though.
16:25 Eh, still looks better than the scorpion king.
you see what you not gonna do is tarnish my childhood like this
Trust me, you wanna see weird movies that don't make sense: 2011's "Detention".
Have you even done an Amanda bynes movie?? 😭 if you want to in the future, please do What a girl wants!
And 4
Kingdom hearts is too fire can’t for 4
I kept up with kingdom hearts and spy kids. Get on my level. I had no life lmao
I remember this movie and still have absolutely no recolection of having ever watched it
This unlocked childhood memories I didn’t know existed
...why is the security staff drinking?
16:24 I can’t stop laughing 😂💀
Sir, after you finish the *'Spy Kids'* saga (?), could you try your hand at the movie *'Matilda'* ?
Don't look at me like that. I'm no loon...
I saw this in theaters as a kid and completely forgot how wildly nonsensical the plot is. Also, how tiny Emily Osment was. Probably because I was also tiny at the time.
Kingdom hearts is very confusing
Steve Buscemi for the win
Idk if someone has commented on this already, but just in case, does anyone else remember the fever dream that was Spy Kids 4
"why do they hate me so? I created them" "Existence is pain" Lol
Your animations are hilarious. Good work sir
When you realize that Donnagan Giggles made Office Space, Beavis & Butthead, and King of the Hill.
Why did I get an add of Puss in Boots played by Antonio Banderas, right when Alex said the adults drinking their sparkling milk
11:21 I HAD WATER IN MY MOUTH!!
Are we not going to acknowledge that Donnogan is played by *MIKE JUDGE* of all people? Y’know, the man himself who created and is the voice of Hank Hill? And Beavis and Butthead?
Junie grew up and married Meghan Trainer.  They have a baby now
Speaking of Will Fridle, he was at the Des Moines Comic Con last month. He is a gem of a human being.
U should react to lab rats
Using her hairicopter move makes me think it was Tails inspired.
I feel bad for parents that had to watch this with us in the theatres when they came out 😂😂... Looking at it now, I honestly can't stomach 20 mins of this
I want to know what is your opinion on this youtuber called Mr. enter, you should review the lorax movie, your right the cgi does look horrifying, but to its credit it must of look good for the time, i mean when you compare it to the movie that where being released at the time. you should review a Godzilla movie.
This movie was so nostalgic I admit it I loved this movie as a kid and was always made fun of bc of it. Man watching the 3D one at home was the highlight of my childhood! I never realized that was Emily Osman in it til now lol if that's how u spell her name prob not
i forgot about that god is heaven line. deep
Is it just me or is the music in toast scene sound like the music 🎶 from 1998's The Mummy?
also i think i just won't stand for spy kids 2 slander because it was super good!!!! all your criticism is invalid haha
4:19 i assumed that after the events of the first movie, the OSS realized that carmen and juni had some special skills (due to saving the world pretty much) and they granted them special privileges. I think it even showed that the director of OSS had some kind of special privileges over the position of the president. So actually, yes, I do think Juni would have called in some special favors and would have gotten her a special talk with the president. That's why they were "SK1" and "SK2" and not some random spy kids operatives that came after them.
You should do how I met your mother
Lol
“Ah yes, this sounds like Benadryl.” I DIED
please do spy kids 3 and 4
Any review about spy kids movies will always get my attention
My Date With the President's Daughter next please. 😂
Please review Spy Kids 3 PLEASE!!!!
U crazy bruh this movie is not 🤢 or whatever that sound was this movie was a banger simply because it makes you feel good inside 😩
How did they get permission to film at six flags over Texas? 😕😕😠😡😂😂
I'm surprised Alex hasn't covered "Dynasty". Feels like the kind of show he would review.
That one Steve Buscemi quote
This whole Channel: This was kinda dumb This was kinda wierd This was kinda insane
The first one may have been silly, but at least it was believable. The tech in this is just... ridiculous
Excellent work Alex! I know you're still mourning Riverdale, I enjoyed it too, but would you consider doing The Vampire Diaries series? Just a suggestion :) Keep up the good work and thank you for your videos!!
you should do heartstopper, a bunch of people have been talking about it recently
Why were the secret service drinking?!
OH MY GOD, KINGDOM HEARTS SHOUT-OUT!
the transmooker looks like a beyblade
I was waiting for the reaction to the "God staying in Heaven" line and I was very pleased. . . . bc who in their right mind would place such a line in a kid's movie?????
There is also Spy Kids 4
Anyone think that gerti sounds like a name for a goat
Do the third movie
I've always wanted miniature Animals because of spy kids 2
Please do The Summer I turned pretty!!!
COULD U DO STRANGER THINGS PLEASEEEEE
Spy kids three is like mid compared to the other two. Honestly, I liked spy kids 4… am I the only one because everyone else is like “ugh, 3 and 4 are garbage!”
Hey Alex you know what movie you should  try doing is the movie brats
Do a video on Aquamarine!
This movie was part of my childhood, loved it and all, but also Steve Buscemi was so WEEEEIIIIRRRRDDDD
Great Video! *This movie is the best acid trip ever*
I love that this title implies the first one wasn’t a fever dream created by somebody ODing on acid
12:39 What’s so weird about someone enjoying model trains?
Would you do a video anout violetta?  It's a Disny channel show
Please do Ms Marvel and the Perfect Pairing.
pleassssssse check First Kill!!!
Alex may you review the summer i turned pretty its begging to be reviewed please 🥺😅
16:27 I always love the idea of horror beings being weirded out by some random creature and asking you, their prey, if you have any idea what or how you should deal with it.  The demon’s like “look buddy I may be creepy, but that thing, god no I’m not touching that thing, you can go kill it and I’ll kill you once you’re done”
11:01 11:01 11:01 11:01 11:01 11:01
Do stranger things
It's so funny to watch you criticize these movies, especially when I didn't understand the stupidity of these movies when I was a kid. Also I have a suggestion, you should do the movie Penelope, its about a girl with a pig nose-
Please do CJ7. It's crazy af
Do 3 and 4. 4's insane😂😂
One year later lmao
Who else thinks Alex meyers should review shorts
can you do a video for first kill?
Please do Cobra Kai there’s been 3 new seasons since you last reviewed it and it is one of my favourites!
Do haunting of hill house
Please do the entire Spy kids series Alex 😆
Cant wait for spy kids 3d. If anything, as a kid, it was my fave of the series bc of the aspect of it being a game. I was like, one day we'll have stuff like this... and now... we have vr games where you can fall out of an elevator while trying to grab a piece of cake so... im like... huh... now that we have vr, all the movie was really good for, not only do i want the movie as a vr game but now i realize how stupid the character arcs of the movie are lol
2:54 he’s so thicc for no reason 😭😭
@11:05 This scene went dark way too quickly. Is this Dubaï??
They fell in spaghetti
Yes god does stay in heaven because of what he created. He did create the platypus.
Reading rainbow though
This was so funny 😂😂 Loved watching your reactions! I can always count on an Alex video to crack me up.
bro fr how have you not talked about hot chick and the fat albert movie
Bro you gotta Do the fast and furious franchise.
Look this movie gave everything I could have wanted as a kid. Its a wild adventure with gadgets and DRAMA
I loved the Spy Kids movies. They were like action movies with kids and FOR kids, not trying to be anything else. They were crazy, but good. And they also showed how ridiculous adulthood is.
what about spy kids 3
Wtheck! This video  is way too good for the amount of views it got!
Hey there just discovered this channel Why aren't these two playlists are there GREAT WIERD/BAD/MESS/WHY THEY EXIST
Honestly the reason why this movies where such hits it's pretty simple I think: they're kid's power fantasies.
Spy kids 3d can't wait for that
I still enjoyed it a lot
"Do you think God stays in Heaven because he's afraid of what he's created?"  Nah. It's more of life sucks down here. I'd stay in Heaven too
13:45 exactly
I know you don’t like anime, but could you consider doing Komi Can’t Communicate?
You should review Avalon high, it's a Disney Channel movie and it's hilariously absurd ✌🏻
If you think that disney channel shows are weird you should try CBBC (Childrens British Broadcasting corparation) shows like Chucklevision or one of the Doctor Who spinoff series. One was Called the Sarah Jane Adventures and was about a previous companion who is now a journalist and solves a bunch of alien related mysteries with a group of school kids. While the other was about a robot dog. IT WAS WILD.
I'm loving your new little animations. All the faces and gestures you make always make me laugh!
Dirk gently
You should do Gnomeo and Juliet
This was my favorite of the Spy Kids films when I was younger. Sure, they were bizarre, but I remembered liking the story and everything to this one. XD
Epalai, I don't remember that being so bad. I LOVED the number at the end, I was like WOAH what a bad ass (and I was like 11, so cut me some slack)
wait if anything electronic shuts down when near the island what if a plane goes over does everyone just die?
Spy kids 2 is the best one
This movie is so good
I enjoyed this along with your other content. Relatable in the sense that I enjoyed these movies/ shows and now I question my younger logic.
and whats with spy kids 4 .-. from 2011 it was shit ;C
This sound like benadryl...👍 I absolutely love it
lol he changed it from 'kinda insane' to 'completely insane'
You don’t realize a movie is ridiculous until Alex sums it up. I mean seriously, but there’s another movie that’s called project mc square. You really should make a movie about it it’s ridiculous and doesn’t really make sense if you think about it. Trust me it’s really dumb but enjoyable at the same time idk sm like that 😭
One part that never made sense to me is why the president followed the teleprompter instead of his on decision. Like is he so forgetful that he has to rely on his electronic devices to remember important things like office appointment decisions? If a teleprompter told him they were going to war with china would he just go follow the teleprompter?
I need a t-shirt that says "do you know how to squirrel"
Spy kids 4-5. i now it goes on .....
I was obsessed with the spy kids movies and music growing up
Alex u have to rate the summer I turned pretty I know you’ve been traumatized through the after movies to all the boys and etc but u have to do this show pleeeaaasssee!!!😂
I'd be real funny if alex just starts reviewing old barbie movies
the 3d version was bad too😭
Why do they make this spy kid girl wear a crop top
I feel called out with date with Roger and 40k figurine’s comment.
If he thought this was a trip, just wait for spy kids 3.
If you thought THIS one didn't make sense ...... Oh boy, just wait til you get to Spy Kids 4 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that right there is an hour and a half of one of the worst abominations of cinema in existence and I cannot wait to see the reactions 🤣
I need to know how sick those camels are because in absolutely zero realities does camel poop look like that lol
Spy kids original trilogy is one of the best to ever do it. These movies never get old I remember having the toys and thinking I was a spy lol
This was my favorite spy kids when I was little!! I don’t know why but it was! Haha 😂
Do the 3rd one
I watched the 2nd Spy Kids movie an absurd amount of times back in the day, even long after I was the target age demographic. I think I found it more interesting of a concept. The plot makes less sense, but they expanded the world way more with more gadgets and spy stuff. I even remember watching the DVD extras over and over. It feels cringe watching it now, but I still fee the nostalgia with the clips shown.
I will NEVER not be upset that as RAW of a line as "Do you think God stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?" delivered by STEVE BUSCEMI is from mother f**king SPY KIDS 2 OBJECTIVELY THE SECOND OF THE SPY KIDS MOVIES
“Do you think that God lives in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he’s created?” Really makes you think.
Best bit of trivia tho is how Junie is now married to Megan Trainor (guess he’s all about that bass) and Carmen is married to Carlos from Big Time Rush and is insanely christian and her life is insane 😂
This was my favorite one as a kid and I haven’t seen it in years and wow…just wow.
Spy Kids 2 was an absolute BANGER of a film, I watched it so much growing up and even had a play set of it which went on so many mission from the sandbox to the bathtub. So dope!
Spy Kids 3 is even LESS coherent than this movie!  Good luck reviewing that one...
When Gurti did that thing with the hair, my exact thoughts were, " what kinda tails knockoff, physics defying fever dream is this?! "
Great job as usual I’m 31 so I relate so much to your takes on these things We experienced em at about the same age lol
I literally want him to do a video on Good Mourning from Mgk. That movie is just straight up garbage if garbage took a tab of acid and decided to shoot itself
the impact gerti giggles had on my childhood can NOT be matched
Please make a stranger things episode
Spy kids 3 is the best one of the series Honesty
please review the show "the summer i turned pretty" its on amazon and gives off typical wattpad teen romcom book vibes XD
What about spy kid 4?
13:45 this is one of those deep quotes that came from random places and became quite famous online without anyone knowing it was from this movie  😂
This was such a fever dream wtheck
This movie owned my childhood be cause I was "the" weirdest  kid aroud
MY NAME IS TIRED AND HUNGRY EVERY SINGLE TIME I COME HOME!
I'M TIRED AND HUNGRY! HELLO TIRED AND HUNGRY!
dude please PLEASE do spy kids 3 next it's even worse somehow
i love the new animation in the beginning
🅱️arri and 🅱️erti
Gosh I had just blocked this movie out of my head as a kid. So I didn't remember anything of what happened.  Thanks for bring that back.
You should do stranger things
Am I the only one who thinks this guy needs to check out lab rats
Do 3 and 4 plx
I love how many trejo always plays as machete no matter the movie he is in
This…. This movie’s where that lines from? 💀
19:59 emphasis on the H
Honestly Alex would have a ball watching First Kill. That show is weird as hell.
IM NOT EVEN JOKING WHENVER I THINK ABT THIS MOVIE I REMEMBER IT AS NOT A MOVIE BUT AS A FEVER DREAM
yay
How did I just notice a frickin pair of Luna lovegoods sunglasses behind minion
You should soo do dark
Just wait till u review Spy Kids 3. U think this one is crazy, the next one is better
Can't wait for you to review spy kids 3!! And 4 maybe...
Since video games came up in this video, I thought I'd mention...When my sister and I were kids and saw this film, we enjoyed watching it purely because we were pretending some of the actors were characters from various Legend of Zelda movie adaptations. Daryl Sabara (Juni's actor) was Mido from Ocarina of Time, Steve Buscemi was the scientist, Pamela's Father, from Majora's Mask, and Emily Osment was Link's sister from Wind Waker. Made the movie so much more watchable and enjoyable. :P
13:03 well how many Adam sandler movies has Steve been in?
Could you please do euphoria please 😣😣😣😣 season 2 please
god I loved this movie as a kid. spy kids 1 and 2 were bangers, despite their plots being insane
Did I hear that right at 1:41 ?
Do “ the summer I turned pretty”
you better be watching the 3rd one in 3d.
"The sleep paralysis deamons are like what is that?! 😂😂😂😂 made me loose it
If you think this was bad you should see the 3D one… The song at the end of Spy kids 2 though… is such a banger.
Can you do Young Sheldon?
This in my opinion is the best of all the Spy Kids movies. The first movie was good, but It was about two kids being thrown into a situation where have to rescue the actual spies. The 3rd had WAY too much CGI, not a lot of Carmen, and Juni wasn’t good at his job as before. Here, they were actually spy kids from the beginning of the movie, especially with the cool gadgets, that dinner fight scene, and them actually going on an assignment as agents. This was so cool to watch as a kid.
first kill
I’m starting to get concerned with all these bizarre Sonic references in every video. Are you ok, Alex?
Anyone else see parallels with "Island of doctor Moreau" in this movie?
so there weren't any Muslims or sober people or former alcoholics in that scene where they drugged everyone
Appreciate the Streets of Rage background 06:08
they really had a ton of famous actors in every single movie, you always see someone & go "THEY were in spy kids??"
They even had a book series. To me it was just as cool as the films 😊
Is everyone forgetting about spy kids 4D????
The theme park is literally six flags over Texas 😂😅
Spy Kids 3 was the best one. Specifically the race.
Can your review the movie ‘monster family’ it’s really bad and I would like to see you review r
what is OSS anyway? (at least in the Spy Kids world?) cuz i remember, a scene of Uncharted 2 (the game, not the movie), that OSS was associated with Nazis or something.
the first film: good and don’t need a sequel  the sequel: sucks so much
Omg! That "okay" after the whole giggle bit sounded hilarious 😂
I know it’s a kids movie but I never under stood why a Spy organization was so public like everyone in that Galla room was a train agent but yep let’s do it in the middle of the city
4:23 and now he's married to megan trainer...lol
This and Shark boy and lava girl are in the same ball park
bro came from getting 250k in a cou0ple of months to getting 500k in just a week keep being great
Love your videos but can’t get through them because of the Mario background music…drives me insane!!
Alex, your jokes keep getting better and better every video. Just wanted to let you know.
"Sky Kids 2 makes no sense" Sky Kids 3: Hold My Oops
This was my favorite movie as a kid and honestly still is.
Best one yet. I way dying. 😂
.........IS THAT TAYLOR MOMSEN ?!?! 😹
Steve Buschemi getting an extemly profound line in _this_ movie: one of the funniest things ever.
Bro do 3!! Do spy kids 3d its a trip. I loved it as a kid
anyone remember the Spy Kids comics they gave out at McDonalds?
duuude   on 8:08 Daryl Sabara looks like a mini Rob Schneider
Boy I can't wait for you to see 3D
Lmao idk why but spy kids 2 & 3 were like my favorite movies
you should watch and review the movie Juno
The helicopter hair scene 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’ve been trying to get it for years, but I still don’t understand anything going on in kingdom hearts
2 was my least favorite, but I still enjoyed it. My favorite was 3 and my second favorite was 1
I just knew you were gonna have a thing about the god quote xD
I actually liked movie 2 more than 1 or 3 as a kid. I know it made no sense, but there was never really a [pause for origin story] moment 2 eat at the time spent on the ADVENTURE part. It felt like a really cool Indian Jones and 007 movie all together. The spider monkey graphics were terrible, but it felt very 90s-2000s kids on a wild adventure and as a kid: I love wild adventure stories. I still do. Only now they get cut in by sexualizing women...😧 or comic relief [no one asked for] characters or really awful dialogue. Like, spy kids isn't god tier, but it's still a million times less cringe-y than Zombie High....Descendants...everything on Disney channel and Hallmark.
You should do a Kingdom Hearts video lol
Aw dang, I loved this movie as a kid, hilarious commentary 11/10
I had no idea Courtney the demon was in Spy Kids 2.
Riverdale wished it was this deep Xd
9:00 I always wondered just WHY Juni wanted to still work for them after this stunt? I haven't watched this movie in Years but I don't remember the OSS having any reason at all to blame Juni other than Gary's word.
what happened to them and the brains... MY CHILDHOOD IS OVER
You cant just not do a kingdom hearts video
I loved these movies when I was a kid, better than Spider-Man and Dark Knight my beloved
Rate the movie how How build a better boy
As a kid, I always thought Carmen and Juni were being sarcastic about how long they were falling in the volcano instead of actually believing they fell for hours. I'm still unsure if I was supposed to take it seriously.
The warhammer 40k reference made me exit out of full screen and sub.
I like the new animation. Keep it up
Now I want to see a video on my date with the presidents daughter she put that dude through so freaking much
Do the Goosebumps movie one of the two
I would like to contest the statement that the subtitle "Island of Lost Dreams" is meaningless.  The clearest meaning of the subtitle is that it refers to Romero’s dreams, first of becoming rich with miniaturized animals, then being renowned for creating his own species. The island is populated by these creatures, so its most recognizable trait is Romero’s lost dreams. But Romero is not the main character, Carmen and Juni are and the title is also about what happens to them on that island. The events of the movie result in Juni deciding the OSS is both too incompetent and too corrupt for him to continue working there. When he leaves, Carmen loses her dream of having a family business and Juni’s dreams of being top agent are simply forgotten. So on a thematic level, the island is a turning point in Carmen and Juni’s lives. As a kid, you have all these grand plans of how your life is going to go. You know what you’re going to be when you grow up, who you’re gonna marry, how many kids you’ll have, etc. And none of it happens because life never goes as planned. Carmen and Juni learn on the island that dreams are always lost.  Why yes, I did watch these movies religiously as a child and still do to this day.
I don't know if you read the comments much, but just wanted to let you know this video made me laugh so hard... and I really needed that. So thank you. You have no idea how much joy your videos can bring people. Especially when the world is so chaotic and everyone has their individual struggles. I'm going through it myself. I can tell you put a lot of hard work and dedication into your content. It does not go unappreciated or unnoticed.
God I hope he watches the 4th one, I HAVE to see his reaction to that one really uncomfortable scene of pregnant Jessica Alba
"do you know how to squirrel"
You need to watch lab rats or mighty med
GOSH I LOVE THIS MOVIE
Please do #3!!
Can't wait for 3D. Its so much worse
Do a video on status update please, it is the most generic teen drama you'd love to make fun of it.
I love these videos!! You should do girl vs monster xx that one makes no sense 😂
I KNEW I didn't imagine the camel poop scene!! That stuff was GROSS
can you do the disney show good luck charlie ?
Ah yes, the movie that only has a place in my mind only because the idea of animal hybrids is cool af, and for no other reason.
i would love to see you react to the fault in our stars and/or the parent trap!
i think that random end credits bit with carmen performing somehow had a major impact on my whole ass life, i forgot that happened and now so many things make sense
15:41 He looks like he could be a Classic Who villain.
365 days second film come out
spy kids four is def my favorite
ONe of the things that always seemed so odd to me is that after Carmen and Juni go through that cursed like... tomb place... they develop telepathy. But like. Only with each other. And it actually becomes a plot point in the third film? Which is like... okay, weird, but also like. Props for continuity I guess.
I totally forgot Steve Buscemi was in this, these movies were GOATED
NOT ALEX COMMENTING ON THE THUMB’S DUMPY 😫😫
can you do blood fest??
There’s also a spy kids 4
i had a crush on the girl.
Spy Kid trilogy is still a great watch for my 25 years old self tbh 😅 Definitely on the list of movies my own kids will watch someday
It is a pain trying to explain wth goes on in Kingdom hearts sometimes I feel like the creators themselves don't know and just add it on, i think that's why I love it so much
😂😂😂😂😂your laugh always makes me laugh
I loved these movies as a kid, now I'm just laughing. Helicopter ponytails?😂
lmao, kingdom hearts pls do that next.
jenny humphrey before she went emo-
omg I googled it and their names are "Juni Rocket Racer Rebel Cortez" and "Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Echo Sky Bravo Cortez" like come on racer? and echo, sky, bravo what is she a goddamn espionage group from the government? 'team alpha head west and team bravo head south.' like tf is this?!?!???
9:10 made me laugh so hard!!!
There is also another part to the trilogy, spy kids 4D, where juni and carmen are grown up
This is the only way I'd be able to sit through the sequels. The first was very good but this and the others after had such awful CGI they're unbearable to watch in their entirety. I saw this one once before on VHS and caught glimpse of the 3rd one's movie trailer and thought 'nope'. The fourth is so bad it flew under so many peoples' radar.
The third one is the best <3 Man those were the days!!!
I will say other than the creatures a lot of the effects and gadgets still look really good for the time. The soundtrack also MAKES this movie so much better ❤️
Still watching childrens films?  Child.
I hope u will review the fourth movie of this series because I don't think I'll be able to watch it again =)
I forgot how goofy this movie was 😂
Alex truly roasts movies like no other
Yo, u had me cracking up today...LMAO....I had me a good ole chuckle🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
The spy kid movies where my favourites as a kid, I don't even know how many times I've watched them, my poor parents
13:53
Wait, THERES A SECOND ONE?! NUH UH, I AINT GOING THROUGH THAT TORTURE AGAIN, I SWEAR IF THERE IS A THIRD MOVIE I’LL- 😡 THERES A THIRD MOVIE um, excuse me for a moment  AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
you should watch summer 03’ it has a few of the same actors from the kissing booth😭😭
I don’t remember anything from this movie except for the skeletons and spider monkey that shows up again later. PLEASE do Spy Kids 3 though! It’s so amazingly terrible and much more memorable
Is that Cindy Loo Who...??
It would’ve been amazing if that god heaven line was improvised by Steve.
Omg my mother thought this was real movie
I love this movie, IDGAF
4:23 The Joseph Biden School of Linguistics and Communication
Please watch chip n dale rescue rangers movie pppppllllllzzzzzz
OMG please do Shorts (2009) next! I remember it as the best movie I watched as a kid
Lmfao this was my childhood jam!!
Yep, I’m still terrified of the special effects on that triple hand guy
Man, 2 and 3 were my some of my favorite movies when I was younger. 1 wasnt bad, but a loved the concepts of 2 and 3
"All right, just gotta finish up my “smokey eye” look and- oh, crap, I hacked the CIA again! Now I'll never get to go on a date with Roger and hear about all his Warhammer 4K figurines!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ok here me out any of the cringe Barbie motives they were my childhood and it would be funny
"I'm not getting down 'till my dad shows up and gives me attention!" "You should try- it will- it's all gonna- it's all just- I mean, do you- have you ever... Do you know how to squirrel?" LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"It spins round and round as fast as the government will allow." "Pfft, tell you what: just the government not wanting us to have fun. If I wanna turn my  child's brain Into guacamole, who are they to tell me otherwise??" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Holy shit youtube stop with all the forced commercials i mean 4 commercials on a short video is ridiculous
Why does minion have 4 heads?
Amazing I barely remember spy kids 2 and kind of love it too.
wait it's not 055 but OSS ? i'm dumb.
I literally watched the movie the day this was posted lol
thanks for making the video it is so fun or funny
Why did I seriously think that was Logic in the thumbnail for like 5 seconds?
My 6 year old just discovered Spy Kids and acts like it's a cinematic masterpiece 😂 Neverending Story? Get out of here. We're watching Spy Kids 2 tomorrow 😂😂😂
It was insane, but I remember it fondly because of that.
You should watch spy kids 4 too
The park is six flags over Texas in Arlington
Spiderpig
Yeah I definitely would not have guessed that immediately after they drink their sparkling milk a minion would pop up on my screen in an ad.
Honestly the greatest thing about the Spy Kids movies are the horrible lines like nice job XD
Do the 3rd one
So many times throughout this video he says things happen for no reason the movie had a reason, he just skipped over it, because it's funnier to complain about confusion I guess. The movie is not that good, but it did explain most of itself. Particularly, Junie was kicked out because his altercation with Gary was what caused the transmooker to be stolen.
Did you really ask, "What is wrong with you, Robert Rodriguez?" over a poop joke?  This is the guy who put the Disney Channel Spy Kids franchise into the same universe as Machete.
I was so obsessed with these films when I was younger💀 I realise now it's a complete mess, but those skeletons bro... They scared the crap outta me
Y’all ready for Spy Kids: ARMAGEDDON? 😺
13:46 Oh geez.....
PLEASE do We Can Be Heroes!
Excited for you review spy kids 3D now
"Do you know how to squirrel?"  -Alex Meyers 2022
Good work gooddd
7:20 immediately after this, I got an old spice ad.
This is the best spy kids movie and no one can change my mind.
This is my favorite movie in the series because of how insane it is
'What do you think Johnson?' *proceeds to push buttons wildly* hey come in Mr.Meyers! Us Johnsons aren't ALL the stupid!
Alex Myers you forgot something... game shakers
I didn't realize this movie came out so long ago?! Holy cow this franchise was my life as a kid
"Your parents named juni rocket racer rebel on purpose?" Why are you surprised, Elon musk named his kid *X Æ A-12*
Spy kids 2 introduced postcredits scenes way before MCU
Gary's hair getting taller and taller 🤣
I can’t wait for you to do the third one
I never saw the first one we got this movie on DVD as a prize and we didn’t have a lot of TV as kids but we watch this movie over and over and over so I didn’t even know there was like I didn’t realize it was the second movie I was thought it was the first one and then I watch the first when I hated it
1:59 yes!! her name is taylor momsen, nowadays she is the vocalist of the band "the pretty reckless" and she has such a cool rock voice, definitely recommend their music!
The Zendaya reference just blew my mind...😶🤯
I think you should watch Arthur and the invisibles 1,2,3 bc the first one is great… but the rest..?
These movies were definitely strange, but I think you had to respect how creative they were. Also, that 'God' line was such a baller line then and still is today. Definitely shows there were good writers behind this.
Hi Alex ,really love your videos , can you make a video on a movie from Netflix "The in between". Really interested to see ur take on this movie.😁
I think I just erased this movie from my mind, I know I watched it, but it's just gone from my mind
bruh you went from Riverdale to #42 on trending good on you
You should do a video on Kingdom hearts
Btw to let you know there's also a Netflix series
The President's daughter kind of reminds me of Veruca Salt from the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
13:42 That part totally went over my head as a kid🤣 Kind of playing with fire there…..
Spy kids 2 is my favorite one 😂😂😂
This dude kinda sounds like Sokka from Avatar the Last Airbender 🤨
I love how when the parents collapsed after the toast, there is 0% liquid on the floor anywhere.
I never really grew up on spy kids atleast the first two but I grew up watching the spy kids "all time in the world" so I would really like to watch Alex destroy this movie.
I just remembered the part when the bad guys escape from the dinner party by their magnet helmets. Literally the ship just swoops them all up and they fly away with their heads stuck to the bottom of the aircraft.
Can u do an episode of bunked the sequel of Jessie
$nafeesahabdul
The Data reference from MegaMan legends made me happy.
Oh wow.
Looks like rock
I hope we don't have to wait a really long time for Spy Kids 3.
This one is probably one of my favorite movies as a kid.
DO HEART STOPPER RN PLEASE DO HEART STOPPER ITS SO GOOD NETFLIX ACTUALLY MADE IT GOOD THIS TIME
13:44 fucked me up hard.
First kill on Netflix would be great like I am forcing myself to watch the first episode
this movie is so ridiculous that's why i love it sm. comfort movie
I know you probably won't see this but could you please do Rowan Blanchard's spy kid movie and your videos are always really funny
Their is another spy kids
I've only ever seen the first movie but there's also an animated spy kids show on Netflix. I don't really remember anything about it though
I mean it's the same era where Cat in the Hat was made.... Even Freddy got Fingered....
13:45 "But whyyyyy????"
I need spy kids three right now!!!
I didn't realize the presidents daughter was Taylor Momsen 😭 She's also Cindy Lou Who And an emo baddie with her band
There's nothing quite like Spy Kids and I adored Carmen's song at the end. She was so cool and I loved her.
You should do CW's Black Lighting
spy kids 3 is the best one.
This was my favorite of the spy kids movies and I couldn't tell you why😅
You know you doing good when you have a sponsor on ever video
The "Spy Kids" movie series is the greatest trilogy of all time🅿
I seen 1 and 3 but 2 always seemed to evade me until i was an adult in college. I feel like disney intentionally aired this one less.
These movies obviously suck as an adult but man they were my childhood , before technology was too advanced these smart watches , drones and all that stuff felt so futuristic, as a kid things like this or “codename kids next door” was like watching our imaginations come to life basically. Good times.
Because of Spy Kids, Carla Gugino could get it before I even knew what "it" was
*Idc what anyone says... The spy kids movies and shark boy and lava girl are damn good. Those movies defined my childhood.*
Considering I watched the movie like 100 times... I still like it and remember it relatively perfectly
Watching this as an adult, Spy Kids 2 is convoluted and disturbing.
Juni is now married to Megan Trainer and has a little boy that looks just like his dad.
ok this one made no sense but SPY KIDS 3 GAMEOVER??? literally the best in the trilogy
Daaww, the opening animation was adorable.
Did anyone else get the reference from the intro?  I am not sure if it was done intentionally but the sound effect is the same as when Lum Invader (From Urusei Yatsura) flies. It was from an old anime that came out in about the 1981
The flying noise from the intro sounds like the same sound effect when Lum flies.  That is awesome!
Haven't watched yet; Really hoping he shouts out THAT Steve Buscemi line, even if its just a punchline gag  EDIT: I am a happy.
You should watch The Bureau of Magical Things
7:19 Then all the adults drink their sparkling milk and you'll never guess what happens! (4 seconds later, an advertisement of a wine store plays!)
11:09 I gotta say it's impressive the camels are well trained enough to all poop in a giant hole instead of anywhere they please.
please do the last song
13:23 Still looks better than Sonic the Hedgehog's original movie design.
11:13 The closest thing we got to having a disturbing scet joke in a kids' movie...
How did we take these movies seriously when we where children
3:51 A soundbite taken from the "Krusty Love" episode! 🤣
20 seconds into the video and already marking out at the Kingdom Hearts reference  actually came over to watch this right after finishing a TheGamersJoint video about KH4 so that kinda made me chuckle a bit
16:52 Dude, is that MIKE JUDGE!!?!    He's the sole creative genius behind Porky's Butthole!
Can’t wait for you to do spy kids 3
I had the biggest crush on “Carmen”  when I was a kid. I used to dream of the day I’d marry her ahaha how fucking lame
You are HILARIOUS 😂❤️
"Do you think God stays in heaven coz he fears what he's created" Bruh
13:47 no. No I don’t. Personally I’m an atheist. (No offense to any Christian’s)
"Do you think God stays in Heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?"  . . . well damn
When Alex said President’s Daughter the first time, I automatically started singing the theme for “My Date With The President’s Daughter”… The reference made me laugh even harder lmao  I’m not so weird I suppose
"why do they despise me so? I created them" i think you have your answer right there sir, i did not expect the ad to be from star trek and if my phone could handle i would totally get it ngl, this reminded me how much i liked these movies, the gadgets and the action were so nice i wanted to be a spy kid obvs, some stories are dumb but honestly thats the fun of it, also watching in english is different, junis sounds so weird, i think the lost dreams was the zoo didnt work out, also thinking about how they were a latin family without forcing anything was just good
Fun Fact:That theme park they filmed at is Six Flags Over Texas Sad Fact:I visited Six Flags back in March and that entrance is gone now
The I like the new style of posing you did for your animated self. The floating around like a cloud thing was cool!
now i want to see your criticism of 3. for some reason i remember one, but not two.. but three was always playing on TV
That one line every 2000s kid knows by heart  "Do you think God stays in Heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?"
Can we get Robert Rodriguez to make a power rangers movie? Just give him 150 million and let him do his thing.
It was Romeroes lost dreams of creating mini Zoo's and failing
to this day I still don't understand how juni got blamed for drugging everyone at the party
cr0ssed their arms in sync
Can we appreciate the new animation thingy for a moment? This has been my  comfort channel for the past 3 years now and these subtle changes are so smooth and satisfying to watch. Plus it lasted 20’ and the work that has been put into this video is really showing. This was just perfect.
The oss conference thing was the set up not the them hijacking the mission at least from what I remember
Woah, nice new graphics Alex
“is that the baby version of dan humphrey’s little sister” yes yes it is
Spy Kids 3 is even weirder, with even worse 3D animation. It was fun at the time, but made just as little sense as the two Spy Kids movies before it.
Do.Upside.down.magic. WHY DID NO ONE RECOMMEND IT? (On disney+)
Saw Alex when you Point out how ridiculous it is that’s when I finally see how ridiculous it is and then ask myself why have I watch this movie 1 million times and enjoyed it every single time
"Island of Lost Dreams" literally makes it seem like it's trying to be a sequel to "Sharkboy and Lavagirl." When really, "We Could Be Heroes" is the sequel
Whoa my memory of the spider monkey made it much less horrifying to look at
Ok but the final song that Carmen sang was an absolute banger.
Back in my day, OSS meant Out of School Suspension.
Bro, i looked up which theme park this was filmed at and apparently it was SUPPOSED to be Disneyland,  but they ended up filming at the six flags that’s literally a 40 minute drive from my house. ✋🏻😂
When the Gertha’s hair was spinning 🤣🤣🤣
wait wait wait wait, THIS is where that deep quote about God staying in Heaven is from????????
Even though the Spy Kids movies were silly and nonsensical, it was still charming, and even rewatching it as an adult, I can still find entertainment in them despite the cringe kid humor and dumb plot points.
What army do you collect for 40k I like the imperial guard or better known as the astra milatarum
No one’s gonna mention how the transbooker is a Simon. Ok then
Kachaw
The only like Spy Kids: all the time in the world  Tails >>> Gerti
I like your updated animation
Pls do First Kill the fighting in some episodes are😂😂😂🙂🤣
Man they really dragged poor Bill Paxton into this.
8:38 is like the Inquisitors using their lightsabers as helicopters in Rebels
Can you do Harry Potter two
The 4th spy kids movie with Jessica Alba is terrible in my opinion it'd be interesting if you did a video about that one.
So glad I use Sponsor block on your videos 😌
I need the third movie 😂😂😂
Jesus saves!
I wish i could like twice.
“Trying to understand anything that’s going on with kingdom hearts” is my life motto
Welcome to another episode of “Alex roasting your childhood.” 😂
Love when you review movies/shows from my childhood 😁
i feel like spy kids was weird in a funny goofy way with a bit of body horror and icarly and victorious is weird in a creepy unsettling way
You should do cartoon network shows
Waiting for 3d & 4.
My fav Spy kids movie was always the fourth one 👍🏻
Alex plz never draw anything Sonic related again  I'll be seeing that in my paralysis dreams
The deep saying by bushimi is made even funnier when you realize one of his later roles is him being God
What do you think Johnson? DEeEErrRRRHhhh  💀😂💀😂
Are you a good person? Let's take the test and compare yourself to the ten commandments how many lies have you told in your life ? Have you ever stolen anything even if it's small? Have you ever looked with lust? Jesus said whoever looks with lust commits adultery. If you answered yes to any of these your either a liar thief or adulterer or all of the above we are guilty of breaking God's law and are under condemnation we deserve hell please don't choose hell  do you know what God did for guilty sinners he sent his son to be the sacrifice for our sins if your in a court of law and your guilty of a crime someone can pay your fine and the judge can do what is just and right and let you go because the fine has been paid Jesus Christ paid the fine on the cross for your sins God can legally let you into heaven and forgive your sins please don't go to hell God is warning you flee from the wrath to come accept Jesus Christ he died was buried and rose again he is now at the right hand of the father come to Jesus today before it's too late you could die tonight and it will be to late for you love u God bless 🙏
I also only watched the first one as a child, but I think it's more on my parents. They basically said "We sat through the first one with you, but no more!"
I adored these movies as a kid which explains a lot about my current obsession with marvel. I swear spy kids was a gateway series to all the biggest teenage nerds
hey alex there is a new show on netflix called if all of us are dead can you make a video about it you have to watch all the episodes first
your obsessed with sonic the hedgehog.
So when are you doing First Kill????
There was a Part 2? What timeline is this?
I was too old by the time Spy Kids was a thing..  now SpongeBob?  You can never be too old for that.
Watched Spykids as a kid, watched Hill House as an adult. Never once realized it was the same mother. 🌈*The more you know*⭐
wait till you see the 3rd and 4th ^^
Whoa dude😭
Can you make a review on swindle? Its a nickelodeon movie.
Could you react to Disney's Secrets of Sulphur Springs?
Spy kids 2 is probably the movie I’ve seen most in my life. I had a play make-up set and I would pretend it was the mom’s computer. I insisted my mom do my hair like Gretti.
Believe or not, there’s actually a fourth movie (legit) called “Spy Kids: All the Time in the World”. It’s with new kids with Carmen and Judy as their older cousins, if I remember correctly.
I have no memories of ever seeing Spy Kids 2. Yet I recognize certain scenes and, of course, the meme.
Never seen it but it Alex makes me thank myself for not watching spy kids 2
This video's animation was just slightly different and I love it!!!!!!
Sparkling milk
I remember watching the 3D one at home with the blue and red glasses and none of the 3D was working so I was just like moving around trying to force the 3D
The ridiculous tonal difference between the spy kids movies and the mariachi trilogy Rodriguez did is even weirder when you consider how closely the release of spy kids 2 was to once upon a time in mexico
We need more videos on the harry potter movies.
Yeah, Spy Kids 1,3, & 4 are good but 2 is just, um...
Alex, I will watch every video you make, even if I haven't seen the show or movie it's about. You make me laugh with your comments alone. You truly are a creative genius and I salute you! 😄
Urusei Yatsura?
I can't with all of Alex's jokes in this video!!! It made the movie 10x MORE funny than I thought it could be!
Can we appreciate that this is 21 on trending
Well, that got deep quick.
Just u wait till Spy Kids 3, they go in a game 💀💀💀
Omg finally a video in 2022 ends at 2022 😂
Considering Alex's reaction to this, I'd say, he's gonna "LOVE" Spy Kids 3...
Disregarding 4, this movie trilogy was my life.
I always want the strong silver bracelet

Spy Kids 3 is so much better. It’s actually a good movie from what I remember
Spy kids 2 is my fav out of all of them
"Butterfly in the skyyyy" 😆 perfect.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!   "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Cover A Series of Unfortunate Events like you did with riverdale.
No I loved this movie so much, I watched it like every week, it was the blueprint
I went to this summer camp and this one kid who bullied me a lot would always make us watch the first movie. We could never watch anything else. It was so annoying. But the counselors let it happen
As a kid I had home recorded VHSes of the second and third movies (but not the first), and I can tell you: "Spy Kids 3D: Game Over" is even more insane than this one.
it's my favorite series of films, idk, it feels like joking about all popular tropes, and third one is my favorite although its about codibg giant robot?? lava??? virtual reality???? what the fuck, but i am in love
Make a video about the new series “the fist kill” or something; you’re gonna hate it so much 😂😂😂😂
You asked: “What movie was this?” The answer: “A good time.”
It was dumb fun as a kid but agree it's pretty cringe rewatching it all
I think why we like these movies in spite of how "bad" they are is because it has heart and they are having fun with them. You can feel the passion. At the end of the day we forget that movies are entertainment. They aren't meant to be flawless stories or anything. If you are entertained, it did its job.
This movie is so dumb but I love it lol
Whoaaa duuuudeee…🥴😂😂
No matter how crazy it is, I still love it all the same
You should do First Kill and Surviving Summer
New video!
I haven't seen these movies since I was a kid and man did they age like milk 😂 gotta love the nostalgia though
steve buscemi saying random philosophical questions in the middle of a dumb kids movie
anyone remember seeing spy kids:4D in theaters and they gave you little scratch and sniff cards? no? just me?🤣
There’s a spy kids 4 as well hehe
This was one of those movies that both me & my brother loved so you bet we watched it all the time because it was one we could agree on 😂 as ridiculous and nonsensical as this movie is, it’s very entertaining
Loved the review. And the movie was weird when I saw it as a teenager. Still ages well.
This movie doesn't need Alex's help
I always thought when I was younger that those were Gerti's giggles and not Gary's
The Spy Kids movies had the life action formula for Kids down. It didnt need to be overly realistic or make much sense, it just needed to be taken seriously by serious actors. That said I am happy I watched these Movies in german, not sure if I would like it as much with Junies original voice. XD
Emily flying with her hair 🤣
wait till he gets to spy kids 3d
In what world would all the security also drink with everyone else?
Fair play for knowing what a ziggurat is.
Does the audio from the movie sound weird to anyone else?
I feel like these movies appealed so much to kids bc they're basically like if you took a kids pretend game and funded it. It's like a power fantasy sort of thing where all the parents are incompetent and the kids get to fix things by having cool gadgets and being smart n shit, plus there's wacky visuals and concepts. Makes about as much sense as what me and my sister pretended when we were kids.
Spy Kids 2 is one of my favorite movies of all time... How dare you! But holy crap, it has flaws on top of flaws lol Teri Hatcher not making an appearance in SK2:TIOLD (That's what the cool kids call it Alex, get with it) now makes sense to me as an adult. She had to have passed due to her injuries when then jetpack launched back in her face in the first SK :( RIP whatever her name was in the first movie.
Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.   (Matthew 7:21) - Repent. Jesus is coming soon.
4:20 Nah Alex, he had a meet with Starlight Tikka Masala at a music festival. That's what.
Thumb man is thick
I like "Spy Kids" as a pitch or a concept but the films are so awkward and kinda cringe. Same with Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Taking inspiration from your own kids doesn't necessarily make a great kids movie.
I liked this movie growing up it was my favorite spy kid movie but I didn't realize how bad some of the acting was like jude sounds brain dead 🤣
Adults, always try to find logic in everything, rather than enjoying. Sigh...
Steve’s *”god stays in heaven”* quote, is one of my favorite memes! Learning that it came from *SPYKIDS 2,* instead of some indie film he did (like GhostWorld or something)—is amazing!! It’s 1000x better now!!🤣🤦‍♀️
" i loved spy kids 1 and I can't understand why"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 You and me both
Act 16:31  And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”   1Co 15:1  Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, 1Co 15:2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you unless you believed in vain. 1Co15:3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  1Co15:4  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,  Joh 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. Joh 3:17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Joh 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  Rom 10:9 because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Rom 10:10 For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.  Act 4:12 And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  Eph 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, Eph 2:9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast. Eph 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.   Rom 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, Rom 3:24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, Rom 3:25 whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. Rom 3:26 It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Rom 3:27 Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. Rom 3:28 For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.  Tit 3:5 he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, Tit 3:6 whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, Tit 3:7 so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. Tit 3:8 The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people.
*”Everyone drinks their sparkling milk and you’ll never guess what happens!”* _{YouTube cuts to a MuscleMilk ad}_ You’re correct. I never saw that targeted ad coming…this guy is GOOD!
You need to do a video on the news Netflix series, First Kill!
hey man ,i think you should check out a show from 2010 called the wannabees i feel like it would make a good video
Wow. I actually forgot about the concert/song number at the end. Wow. I loved watching these movies when I was a kid.
the reason i am so happy this video exists is that it gets us one step closer to you making a spy kids 3 video
I saw what you did there with the Palmer girls thing
Oh god i used to be OBSESSED with this movie. Like i used to go around and tell people my name was Alexandra (the president's daughter's name)🥴
The first movie was old enough that I watched it on repeat as a kid.  The third movie was new enough to always stay in my mind.   The second movie felt like a fever dream…
I didn't know they filled at six flags over texas in Arlington
I love the new animations!!
This is by far the best Spy Kids movie.
I had the biggest crush on Carmen And Gary when i was a kid
is it me or his animation improved?
Your regular sleep paralysis demon stands next to you and says "the heck is that?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hello
I cant wait your review of cat in the hat
I can’t be the only one who thinks Spy Kids 3 was the best one
I was never a fan of this kind of movies. In fact they bored and annoyed me. 😐 I really loved the “Harry Potter” series and usually fantasy movies and games. 🙂 And I still do. 😁 By the way, you started reviewing the “Harry Potter” series. Will you continue with the other movies of the series?
Carmen's middle names were Elizabeth Juanita Echo Sky Bravo.
The jugular is good at juggling balls
Your a fan of kingdom hearts?👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😄
i loved this movie as a kid. still do, sure it's batshit crazy and i LOVE it, it perfectly captured the point of a kids movie. it's just FUN. just absolute crazy fun
Some of the wackiness in this reminds me of something that would happen in some more absurd anime.
Okay I remember spy kids 1 & 3. The second one was lost to my family and I'm glad of it.
I never knew what any of the titles of the movies were, but Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams, is such a great name for life 😂   The main plot of Adulthood is the Island of Lost Dreams 😭  Some depressed adult clearly came up with that title.
14:18 isn’t that just the Bermuda Triangle? 🤯 🤯 🤯
Duuuuude, watched your video because I remembered that Steve Buscemi had a bomb line which I even wrote down somewhere back in time. With the note "spy kids wtf".
oh please do the next one it’s almost as crazy
I know these movies make no sense but... I still love them hahaha. I feel like as an adult it makes no sense, because it's on a kid's logic level or something haha
You've gotta do the third movie as well! I remember being it my favourite movie of all time
Damn nice new animation….. i really hope its new..
One of the greatest kids movies of all time
11:15 The poop in between that chico’s teeth was absolutely not necessary 😭 the directors were wrong for that one
I didn’t understand the plot…
Spy kids 3 is the best of them, do that oen next?
Cantalope Approved.
Bro I didn’t even know move 2 and move 3 existed
There is a spy kids 4 aswell
This was my childhood movie and I loved it looking back on it don’t know why
I like the new floating Alex animation
We all agree that this movie was the worst of the trilogy, right? Like, no one really watched it right?? Only 1 and 3D.
This movie is best viewed high
Great video as usual.
Still the best out of the whole series. Buscemi is wayyy too good in this one.
Is that Bill Paxton?
Duuude... I've seen that "god lives in fear of what he's created" quote around tumblr. But i did NOT know it was from spykids 2. What. The entire fuck.
Best video yet!!
There’s no telling how many times I watched this movie as a kid
If you think this movie is bad, just wait until you watch the 3rd one
So I looked up Carla Gugino's age. She's 50 now so she'd have been 30 or max in her early 30s during Spy kids 2. Do 30 year olds in the US regularly have 13 year old kids?
Spy kids 3 was the best hands down. Do that next
8:15 Did ... did her bracelet just turn her into Dixie Kong?!  She has a Dixie Kong bracelet!
How much money do you get from YouTube for 1000 subscribers?  A
My regular sleep paralysis demon would give me a break for a bit because my mind is too far gone at that point🙃
The “professional movie-watcher” reminded me so hard of Dylan is in Trouble hahaha
The fact that this is my favorite Spy Kids movie lol
Love the new drawings and animations- so funny XD
Do spy kids 3!
"Do you think god stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?" - Steve Buscemi, Spy Kids 2
I can't believe that God stay in heaven quote come from here
YAYYYYYYY! Squishy marshmallow guy is back!!
Ik everyone’s talking about the movie, but can we appreciate the little character animations? I thought they were amazing :>
I swear these ads come on at the most hilarious moments 🤦🏽‍♀️😂😂😂: "The adults drink their sparkling juice and you'll never believe what happens!..."  Tapas ad: " His Majesty, the Emperor, has passed away..."
CAN YOU DO 13 GOING ON 30, pleeeeeaasse
I may be flying sky high rn, but did they seriously call it "Transmooker?" while playing it off somehow with a straight face? Also I forgot there was time when Machete became every dad joke combined.
6:49 ITS THE PRESIDENT FROM WE CAN BE HEROES!! WUUUUUUHHHHHHGGGGGGGGG
Did you know the actor of Juni is married to Meghan Trainor?
Just envisioning Cheryl from Riverdale being all Q-bondian with Betty's hair into those exact pigtails, off to save whatever.
I loved the ending dance number with carman and the spider monkey and honestly this whole movie!
that camel poo scene traumatized me as a kid
Top 10 most insane movies
Spy Kids 3 is goated tho
Spy kids 3D is really good. Loved it the most of the three movies when I was a kid!
Uhhh Alex, Robert Rodriguez's kids grew up in Austin Texas
Shout-out to 6 Flags Over Texas. That was a pretty random place to film the theme park scene
The best dialogue in all of Hollywood history has to be "you're so full of shiit......ake mushrooms"
no no, he's right about Carla Gugino
Ha ha love your videos! This was actually my favorite Spy Kids movie as a kid. This video was fun!
A shame you didn’t include the gadget scene. I feel it shows how this series of movies chooses style vs practicality. The giggle kids use nanomachine gadgets that display their functions like the time with a bland holographic display, that while probably efficient, lacks much creativity and pazzaz than the bulky gadgets and designs of gizmos Carmen and Junie use   And I kinda liked the asshole kid in the scene cause he almost sounded genuine with his take on using prototype gadgets vs the “common out of date ones” and even accidentally destroying junie’s robot buddy
To me SK 1 was the best, 3's race still holds up better to me than Ready Player One's (though it's a pretty clear influence for the movie) Didn't see 2 till I was 20 and I was like wtf is this?
i cannot believe how incredible you are !! also dude you got 1k followers in 12 hours!
I remember the first and third movies well, but this one is a blur in my mind.
I used to love these movies as a little kid. And you know what? Even though I know just how unbelievably stupid that these movies are now, I still love ‘em. Nostalgia? Yeah, for sure. But damn I love the pure absurdity of these movies.
I thought Gary looked so old when I was like 6 but now that I’ve watched it when I’m older he looks 12💀💀😂
I still loved the Spy kids trilogy as a kid and now as a kid. The 4th one was just not it....At all 😒
hold on, after years of watching this i've figured it out. sk1 and sk2 stand for 'spy kids' 1/2. WHAAAT!!!!!
Yeah but it is fantastic regardless. Oh btw, I wanted those magnetic hand things, the downgrade watch set and a Dragonfly especially a Dragonfly because the way it provides a meal is so worth the investment.
I really loved these movies as a kid but even as a adult I can admit the cave where they hear each other's thoughts but can't be heard if they open their mouth is a cool idea. I really believe the movies had some really decent and creative ideas in general, no one can ever say they are ripoffs of anything
Can you pleeeeease do bunk'd??
AHHHHHHHH
I've been watching Cinemasins too much. Every single time he says something I expect to hear a *ding* afterwards.
I love how the secret service agents also drink the toast and fall asleep.
YASSSS!! I"VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOVIE REACTION FOR SOOO LONG!!!
13:33 Jesus. That was so much deeper than I remember.
Congrats on trending!
never watched 1 or 2 but 3 was my JAM! edit: WAIT I DID SEE 2 I REMEMBER THE STEVE BUSCEMI SCENES!
i love your Videos so much
The products and/or moves never makes sense, but this movie I will always love and cherish. I grew up on this film than I did with the first one. 😂🥹
Okay but are you aware of the fourth one?? Spy Kids 4 was my childhood and I need your opinion on it
When people used to ask me what my favourite movie was I never what to answer. But then I realised i could remember almost all the quotes from this movie from the amount of times ive watched this in my childhood xd
I LOVE this one. It's the best of the Trilogy to me. It's fun and campy.
ya subbing is nice but do you know how to squirrel?
Tbh, my favorite parts of this movie involved Gurdy's hellicopter pigtails. I wanted those SO BAD.
Pls do spy kids 3 that was my favorite movie when I was 6
Think I was too old for these movies when they came out (early 2000's, so...about 12 or so) and have always found them horribly cheesy and cheap, lol.
The craziest part to me is how Juni mouths “what do you want me to say” without thinking it. 🤔
R.A.L.P.H. is still my favorite severely underrated robot companion
Why did you point out the thumb dude’s cake like that LOL. Also TIL that Robert Rodriguez named his children Rocket, Racer, and Rebel. I’d really hate introducing myself as rocket or racer.
Juni was blamed because he grabbed the device first then gary tried to take it for himself the magnetheads made off with it in the scuffle then Gary put the blame on juni
“Do you think God stays in Heaven because he too, lives in fear of what he's created?”  “Billie for the last time, eat your cereal.”
Wait there's a spy kids 3....
🤣is that Emily Osment was she born yesterday,omg I can't stop laughing🤣
Laughed so hard at the “ Whoa Dude” part.
I fucking LOVED Spy Kids 2! I've watched the DVD special features soooo often. I've always wantd my own RALPH lol
I only watched dub in br-pt and I can assure you that the lines were much better than THIS!  The movie was weird but was entertaining, its different and fun. Its not that teen agent movie which was "better", but I actually prefer this one
I only watched dub in br-pt and I can assure you that the lines was delivery with much more emotion than THIS!
Oh yeah, im pretty sure that steve buscemi's line at 13:46 is part of the reason i need therapy...
please do a video on first kill 🫶🫶🫶
You should review p valley Iknow you would do good
I lived in awe of Gerti and her propeller hair when i was a kid... I wanted to be her so bad
11:37 Adrian Monk's sure come a long way hasn't he
share your opinion on Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn
There's a whole generation that doesn't even know Shrek exists sooo
and to think i made my grandfather watch it like 16 tikes with me. i still love it
As adults, we realize how weird our childhood shows were, because we start applying cohesiveness, logic, and common sense onto these shows. Yet I do still enjoy watching these shows and I'd definitely never wish to unsee this part of my childhood.     It's nice to think back to a simpler time where everything made sense for us, even if they actually didn't. It's a part of a child''s imagination and creativity to find patterns/logic where none is. Sometimes  that skill is something I miss ❤
It just clicked that the president’s daughter is also Cindy lou who lol 😆
10:44 looks like I might have to change my password...
When this mans watch spy kids 3 if he doesnt at the very least show "Game cheats? That's against the rules.. We're gonna have to bounce you back to level 1" we gonna have problems
SPLICED!!!
3 million subs
8:21 Alex Giggles
I love that you used the Simon says 😂
My little brother and I still love Spy Kids 1 & 2. When we were little, we knew they were absolutely bananas and made almost no sense, but they were still great lol
These films represent kids' imagination,  and those kids have ADADHDHD
The only thing I remembered about spy kids was that juggling thing and how i wished one of those existed And the thumb people
Wow. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard while watching one of your videos. This was just too funny! My stomach actually hurts. Anyway, thanks for the Giggles! get it? Alright, i'll let myself out.✌😅 13:40 💀🤣 That's really deep and philosophical, but _my_ question is, if "god" is afraid of *_us,_* he can just snap his fingers like Thanos and it'll be like it never happened, right? So, what's keeping "god" from doing this? The answer is simple. god never existed to begin with. That's my educated guess. Let's just hope I don't wake up at 4 am with that CGI _Eraserhead-_ baby-looking crab monster at the foot of my bed. I won't worry, though. I've got my tiny tiger always sleeping next to me. 😸💁🏻‍♀
ayo what did RHENEAS do to you
According to IMDB that Spy Kids show ( Mission Critical) already aired in 2018-19. Spy Kids 4 came out in 2011. Are we in some sort of time loop? Did this video actually come out years ago and somehow it just showing up now? I'm very confused.
Who else is excited for the video on the next movie?
dont forget Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World.... there's a reason no one really knows about it
I knew the movie was real weird, but I was intrigued by some of the nonsensical cross animals... And Gary and Gerti were super annoying.
bro review first kill its... intresting...
At 13:46 when he says "Do you think god stays in heaven because he too is afraid of what he created" I was so shocked at such a deep line. Like this is fucking spy kids let me watch thumb monster terrorize children with bad cgi.
No way you just roared juneys convo with the presidents daughter that was deep
The fact that you loved kingdom hearts 🙏🏽🔥
Spy Kids was a cinematic masterpiece
Latino main characters proud of their heritage with genuine motives and beliefs.. How was this series so ahead of its time... I'll never get over how hilarious all the effects were either. Truly perfect films 💕✨️
Omg the hair…I can’t breathe…still laughing  😆
“Does it go fast” that’s what she said
I don't think I cared about the story that much as a kid, I was just interested in all the cool gadgets and the interesting scenes. The submarine part was my favorite part of the movie and it was entirely missed from this video
As a kid I enjoy watching Spy Kids 2
Can you do first kill on netflix
There was a whole show and a whole fourth movie that no one ever... talks about? Love to see your thoughts on those, my little sister loved them and I unashamedly did too.
Thumb man has an entire bakery back there! XD
"Do you think God stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?" is actually one of the best movie quotes of all time - thanks Steve Buscemi
The fact you say you were distracted with KH so werent able to see the movies is strange since 2 &3 released a year after between eachother and 2 having the same amount of time between Spy Kids.
Please do soy kids 4
Mock it all you want but there was a significant amount of time in my childhood where I believed that if my pig tails spun fast enough I would have the ability to fly.
Alex Meyers absolutely needs to watch rescue rangers
Alex you should do the movie "jinxed"
I know I've seen this movie. I know it for a FACT.  Not a single moment of this looks familiar.
13:45 That made me question life too.
Not even sure how that thing was supposed to hurt Gutierrez & his wife. It shuts down electronics, it doesn’t fire lasers or open portals to Hell or turn things into mutants.
Yes the best one
I watched this movie so many times on VHS when I was younger, never saw the other ones, but I was entertained and that's all I could ask for.
Did Steve Buschami actually say that God stays in heaven because he fears his creation?  That's very similar to the plot of Season 1 of Miracle Workers starring guess who as God!
13:45 - 13:52 (Grabs mic) Cleanup in aisle 2, my mind just exploded.
13:45 made me laugh out loud and go into an existential crisis at the same time.
You think this movie was out there?  The weirdness quite literally levels ups in movie 3.
Why the heck would anyone ask YOU to sponsor their star trek new worlds game?! There are so many waaaaaay more deserving creators who are ACTUAL star trek fans... Tbh kinda gross imo.
My favourite thing about the SPy Kids films, and just robert rodriguez in general, is that his main thing, wasn't making a good movie, it was having hella fun. and he achieved that.
now il never get to go on a date with roger and see all his warhammer 40k models 😥
4:31 Have you ever had a dream w-where you-you
There will be no second coming of Jesus
I think u should do Nancy drew, it’s like a mix between riverdale and Sabrina. Totally ridiculous but well written. All so hope u do spy kids 3, because this was hilarious!
you should review the original power rangers movie 1995

Will miss bill paxton
“Does god stay in heaven because he too is scared of what he created?”  That’s some real shit
Who y’all wannna hit with 👊
I had to delete Star Trek fleet command because I was completely awful at playing the game.
You’re Trending number 17 on YouTube 🤯🔥
Yeah that's how I was I love watching spy kids when I was younger.
Happy birthday to me 🎂
#17 on Trending…. Go Alex !! ✅
"Your sitting there after waking up and you see that at the corner of your bed, and then your regular sleep paralysis demons are sitting there next to you and go "The heck is that?"." I need to remember that one.
Love the new end screen :)
That fucking line from Buscemi is so unbelievably deep and why is it in this weird kids movie?
Do you think God stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?
13:45 I always wondered where that line came from, and now I know
Your videos never fail to make me laugh
Can you do lab rats Bella and the buildings jump in blindside
I hate that now at the age of 22 I can still perfectly remember Carmen and Juni's full names
idk y but as a kid, this made perfect sense and this was my favorite out of the trilogy (I don't count the fourth bc it's diff characters and it sucks) Watching it now, it's so weird. WTF is going on?!!
Please review the third installment of spy kids next
Spy Kids 2 > Spy Kids
I’m not ashamed to admit I recreated the ballet scene all the time and desperately wanted my own helicopter ponytails so bad. Still do tbh
Can you do supah ninja
the spykids movies were just a feverdream and I loved every second of it
20 MINUTE VIDEO IN ONLY 7 DAYS!! LITERALLY HOW!!??
I guess the next one will be spot lids 3 and then 4 sent we’re going in order 🫤 off day do the TV show…but that’s animated.
8:15 LMAO
Did he change the background music during some of the scenes? I don't remember it like that and it doesn't seem to fit.
My favourite spy kids was Spy Kids 3: Game Over. Like probably every kid who played video games, being sucked into a game sounded absolutely amazing and this film did just that.  I'd still love to, but now we have VR so I can just pretend I am in the game while not potentially dying.
why does the juggler look like a even bigger loser version of osomatsu
This movie! I remember loving this film when I was young but my god watching this video made me realise how weird as shiz it was 😂 cried laughing at the reactions
Idk why I missed this one. I saw the first. And I saw the third, I completely missed the second Looks like I didn't miss much
Now I know why my mum didn't want to rewatch the movie back in the day
I was never into this franchise.
I love this movie and always will haha Spy kids was super important for my childhood!
That my date with the president's daughter reference!!!
Gerti Giggles went on to become Lily from Hannah Montannah
I didn’t realize how well I knew this movie until the music was so jarringly “this is not right” 😂
I can honestly say I never liked these movies as a kid. They looked so cheesy and the cgi was so bad.
Nice new animations. KUDOS
The sponsor ends at 1:28
woah dude
13:52 💀💀💀💀💀😂
13:54 has me DYING
I swear i saw this movie when it came out but i have absolutely no memory of it
I never saw Spy Kids 1 (although I kinda have now through the 1st video) but I watched spy kids 2 repeatedly on dvd (still own it) and saw what I think was spy kids 4 (the one with all the clocks) in cinemas in 4d. Spy kids 2 is still one of my favourite films despite my inconsistent knowledge of the series
Alex really does make me cry laughing
10:33 I have never noticed there was a BIONICLE Gali.  (it's not a bionicle or bionicles as it's not legos but we keep saying legos and bioncles for lack of knowledge of better branding terms)
You have to do spy kids all the time in the world  next (:
Oh man, it's been so long since I've watched this movie. We used to watch it all the time! And like most young boys my age then, I totally didn't have a crush on Alexa Vega... totally ☺️
I actually really enjoy Spy Kids but they are ridiculous. The spinning hair is the most amazing thing I have ever seen.
Okay ngl this was one of my favourite films as a kid and even watching this.... I still love it
U skipped the best Character........the early version of Machete
Why am I hearing the same matador music in bruh Matilda AND Spy Kids?
I'm sorry, what?   should have been the title.
Haha, OMG, that reference to My Date with the President`s Daughter caught me off guard! I didn't think anybody remembered that movie let alone knew it existed!
Please do the owl house
To this very day I still use “we were just… talking about you😈” ALL the time! 😂
I used to love this movie as a kid. Didn't remember it being so insane
omg this was sooo funny to watch , i hiope u get casted for something this just as funny or more or get this to the big screen.. can u do First kill or Perfect pairing ,
The thing I love about these movies is, well even if it feels silly to an adult, it knew exactly what would be cool to kids and it went for it.
The Steve Buscemi quote STILL haunts me. It's been years
You should react to girl from nowhere it's on Netflix
I love how the theme parked was filmed at six flags over Texas! Grew up going to that park!
I literally just watched the first video this morning 😂
…And their newly formed spy kids organization. Brought to you by child soldiers; because you’re never too young to die for your country. 😂
Did you really just refer to Dinky "The Dinkster" Winks as "Park owner guy"?!?! Put some respect on The Dinkster's name!
9:30 🤣
Yes! Yes! Yes! I’ve been waiting for this one!!!
I watched this movie as a kid and cringed and suffered and if I was to watch it now, I would probably die of cringe
OMG That's why the mom on Hill House looked so familiar!!!
I was waiting for Alex to react to that Steve Buscemi line the second I started this video!
It just sounds like the Transmooker is a McGuffin
Did the avatar style change a bit? I like how he jumped about, and looks a little different.
I know your probs already onto it but spy kids 3 is even more wild
This has been and will ALWAYS be me and my son's favorite Spy Kids.  The story kept us entertained and laughing plus the Island was dope. Loved this whole movie HATED Gary and Girl Giggles
I still love the spy kids movies tho! And to answer Romero's question, I don't think God is afraid of his creation, just disappointed.
Disney execs watched this and thought "this is who should direct/produce Boba Fett"
I used to love Spy Kids movie... my favorite kids' movie. But I never had realise that the story didn't even make sense T_T So ridiculous now
now i cant wait for the 3rd and 4th one💀💀
Hey !! Nice video, can you do a video for the movie Nancy Drew ( 2007 ) with Emma Roberts please 😊
Alex, Legacies is ending and BOO, Bitch is coming.
To elaborate on a small thing, OSS (if they are talking about the IRL one which they probably were) stands for 'Office of Strategic Services' That doesn't exist anymore, as it was replaced by the CIA in 1947. The OSS was founded in 1942 due to the lack of an intelligence agency. So this means in spy kids the OSS was never dissolved in 1945 after WWII and instead kept around. It is my belief this is the divergence point where Spy Kids splits from the IRL timeline.
This movie is perfection (and yeah, zero sense) lol
Man your editing skills are so amazing man I'm dying of laughter
It was weird and made no sense, bad cgi but childhood memories
13:45 I remember after watching this loads of times as a kid, one day I watched this scene and had basically alex's reaction lmao. The fact that this came from SPY KIDS 2 is amazing and hilarious. It's such a good line and a real thinker!
they fed us this garbage and now they wonder why we want to kill ourselves lol
I love that someone made an active decision to keep the line "Do you think...God stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?" in a children's movie.
...theres a 4th one
❤️❤️❤️
The fact that I have always had Alex's critics attitude even as I was 5
I had the opposite to you I only watched Spy Kids 2 and non of the others 😂
9:30 I see you got a thumb-thumb of yourself downstairs alex
Had so many comments about this video and movie until Alex "why" at the end and pronounced the H sound dramatically, my brain shut down
Bkt
forget liking Spy Kids movies as a kid, I still like Spy Kids movies as an adult! They're ridiculous, campy, and I love it. This one is definitely my favorite of all the movies. IDK why, maybe because I like the island idea.
Have you ever considered making a video about the Disney movies "Secret Society of Second-Born Royals" and/or "Artemis Fowl (2020)"? I find them both very entertaining. I'm sure you would be able to find many things that doesn't make sense.
I think it’s so funny that Juni grew up to marry Meghan Trainor
I keep doing try not to laugh with these videos and i keep failing!! LOL
I really loved this movie as a kid! Despite that I had not watched any of the other movies at the time including the first one so I really had no idea about anything in the movie like the thumb guys and stuff.
Omg that slowed down version of the reading rainbow theme made me snort
How did I never make the connection that their last name was giggles cause of their weird "giggles"????
Was that a reference to ten chan from urusei yatsura at the start of the video? 😍
Is it weird that I completely understand this movie?
Noice
Most movies by Robert Rodriguez is known for more unusual films.
I loved watching spy kids back in the day it slapped nostalgia makes me remember it more fondly
i still can't get over its called/pronounced transmooker
Judy  is high in this movie
Can’t believe Juni is married to Megan Trainor and Carmen is married to Carlos from Big Time Rush.
13:23 is already giving me nightmares and it isn't even night yet
the third one's better...i think
"How long have we been falling?"  "Idk my watch doesn't tell time" lol
Just wait for Spy Kids 3
Cindy Lou Who?
Spy Kids 2 was my Jam. The only one I own on DVD lmao
...Same guy who wrote and directed the El Mariachi trilogy and wrote the music for Kill Bill Vol. 2...I'm so confused...
This video was so great
When you said you had been trying to understand kingdom hearts plot line I laughed because same…….till this day same…….
They had more then one?????
I cannot WAIT for your spykids 3 video
As someone who watched this as a kid, I never truly processed how horrible it was, it was just like 'funni spider monkee' and that was it. Now that I remember it, it was horribly bad.
PLEASE ALEX can u do DER DUMB  DIARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just realised how bad the green screen and CGI is. I guess when you are a kid you don’t notice that
I’ve been watching Spy Kids 2 many times over the years (the most recent time was last year because it’s my favorite one of the franchise) and I’m JUST now realizing Gary had a weird giggle because his last name is Giggles
Ohhhhh Alex, just you wait for the third one
This is honestly the best spy kids movie out of all of them
Aw man, RIP Bill Paxton. Nice to see him again for a bit
Oh you're approaching me (Turns on hair-copters)
love the commentary and i hate to bug you but..Heathers please dude
The OSS was disbanded on September 20th 1945, and yet, here we are
Wait in the mobile game it incorporates the shitty Burnom one two isn't it the one that fans hate cause its terrible  I never liked the Spy Kids movies but i never hated them they were ok to watch and possible to be watched but i never gotten why three were made  Seriously this adult agents just reveal to people that they are incompetent and they chose children to not only be agents but that they are better then them how are they not ashamed of themself   This one thing is any gag shows i hate is when not properly trained for a fight kids beat up adults  I never gotten her helicopter hair how do they work was her skull altered or what how is that even possible   It makes no sense why they chose he is to blame for it. How is a kid able to break the agency safety that was thought to her, if she is smart enough to hack anything how is she so dumb to just reveal her true identity to a person she just met?
Now we just need spy kids 3 video …
"You wake up at 4 am and see THIS at the foot of your bed and your regular sleep paralysis demon is standing next to you and says 'what the heck is that?!'" 💀
Oh no squidward! Pepto bismol is dying of a pepto bismol overdose!
I dressed up as Gerti for halloween when I was in 3rd grade, FULL ON cosplay put together by my mom, that's how much I loved this movie.
The Spy Kid movie I remember the best is the 3rd one and it was also insane
I loved this movie when I was kid and now my kid loves this movie and is currently watching it nonstop. And I’ve noticed a lot of these issues and it’s nice to hear another adult perspective
literally never knew there was a spy kids 1 or 2 until a few years ago, but i remember seeing spy kids 3 and liking it
I think the appeal of the Spy Kids movies is that this stuff is kind of the thing kids think about when they think of spies. Cool gadgets, saving the world, and fighting bad guys, and that's pretty much what these movies do and I felt the first 2 movies do that well.
The Spy Kids movies are definitely some of my favourite movies
Hey Alex next u should do dear dumb diary
Alex, wh- why are you covering Spy Kids?
0:19 same and i still don't
The woman from the President's Daughter movie is Elisabeth Harnois (born 1979). The girl in this movie is Taylor Momsen (born 1993).
Please someone say something about the Urusei Yatsura "Ten" at the beginning
Robert Rodriguez has got to have the weirdest filmography out of any director currently working today…
13:45 The script foreshadowing Spy Kids 3D
the thing about Robert Rodriguez movies is that they were just kids movies. they weren't "fun for the whole family" where they add a bunch of "jokes for the adults". they were just movies where they did as much cool shit as they could in a very childlike manner and I think that's kind of what makes them as great as they are. They're dumb kids movies made to be cool to kids, and they don't try to be anything else
Can you do Grown Ups plz
16:27 lol
I loved the first 2 spy kids. Sure they’re weird kids movies but looking back yeah 2 was....oof weird as hell.  Keep up the good work
Always love your videos. Never saw this movie but still enjoyed this!
I didn't expect a half second-long Urusei Yatsura  reference on an Alex Meyers video.
I loved this movie so much. It was my favorite out of all the three. And you pointing out the absurdity of the ridiculous scenes does not deter me from my love of the movie. It was so fun and fantastical to rewatch for the hundredth time and just imagine myself as a spy kid in those scenarios.   Now as an adult, the actions and thought processes of the adults is kinda messed up to me but as a kid, I didn't care and just assumed all the adults from that world had the same IQ or less than that of a proffessional spy kid.   Ah well. This was my chance to rewatch it with your input, and even though I agree with how absurd it is, I still love the movie.
“Do you think God stays in Heaven because he too lives in fear of what he’s created?”  That’s really deep, especially for a kids movie.
People need to realize that the things we used to watch are so weird to us now that we have grown up, the new generation will think the same about the shows they are watching now. (If that makes sense)
“Do you think God stays in Heaven because he too lives in fear of what he’s created?”  For a movie made for kids, that’s extremely dark.
“Do you think God stays in Heaven because he too lives in fear of what he’s created?”
gg
I just heard warhammer 40k
This used to be my favorite of the 3, and omg, it is so bad 😂 I used to think the spider monkey looked so cool
Ashamed to say this was one of my favorite movies to and I don't know why just cool I guess
Didn't even bring up the best part of the movie. The McDonald's product placement.
I watched this movie like everyday as a kid I swear i know all the lines😂
I remember watching this movie religiously when I was a kid. I thought the flying pigtails were the coolest thing. I also remeber the animation being much better..
Could you please do upside down magic it is a disney channel movie
“Yes. Yes I do know how to squirrel.”
Spy kids 3 next?!?
14:01 when that song cuts in, Jesus🤣🤣🤣
Spy Kids was the movie I played when Zathura became too boring
I just love this movie, and that's it! Should rewatch soon.
Bro you should totally review Superhero Movie (2008) no joke that's the title
Spy Kids 3, plz & Thk U!
“Have you ever had the feeling that God lives in Heaven because he’s afraid of his own creation?”
How do you do fellow spy kids
ps, I loved loved the song at the end, maybe they wanted to make her like disney star?? Wish it was more successful
This series was LITERALLY my childhood
I'm getting a migraine just looking at Gertie's hair omg.
oh my, you just reminded me how uch I loved this movie!! I think the secret is design, as it is innovating, fun and colourful
It genuinely feels like all of the spy kids movies were just some wicked insane dream I had. Like no one would believe me if I gave them details about these movies if they never watched them.
The last 2 spy kids was so stupid the time one and the shark boy and lava girl but the cringest one outta them was the shark boy lava girl when they are older it was so cringe and u can't help not to laugh at the movie lol the best movie outta all of them was forsure the first one the game over one was ok oh cause we got tk see the grandpa walk lol
Damn, I remember seeing this in the cinema when I was like 10
We need spy kids3 🙌🏼 looooove that one! how about the weird song at the end of this film ? Was it only on the video version (yes I’m that old haha) 🤔
Spy kids was my shit when I was a kid I watched it alot when u grow.up it really changes then when u were a kid but how is the dad's spy's when the fight was so crappy lol rolling on the ground and stuff yea there old but still the fight part with them to was the shittyiest lol
Spy Kids 2 was the first DVD we owned when I was a kid. The movie is absolutely bonkers but it's a childhood favorite because it appealed to my crazy imagination 😊  Also- the bonus features that showed behind the scenes and how the movie was made really reinforced my love for film.
Spy Kids 2 has always been my favorite of the series and was actually my comfort movie as a kid. Anytime I need cheering up or to just turn my brain off Spy Kids 2 is my go to XD
Finally
do moonknight
The Spy Kids franchise is how I was introduced to many famous actors. Like Steve Buscemi was "that crazy scientist from Spy Kids 2"  and Sylvester Stallone "the bad guy from Spy Kids 3" for much longer than I'd like to admit :D
I was today years old when I realized Gary and Gerti giggle bc their last name is Giggle. Thanks Alex. Took me over a decade but I got it. 🤡
Bro slowed down version green green’s was funny
When I was a kid spy kids traumatized me, and I don’t mean I was just scared of it I mean I had nightmares for a week I still vividly remember it
Wait what created the skeletons and the cave where you listen to peoples thoughts???
PLEASE do a video trying to explain KINGDOM HEARTS!!! 🤍🤍🤍
Wow I watched this and completely forgot how ridiculous and nonsensical was.
The music edits tripped me up, then the quote came in and for a second I thought that was the actual music then forgot this was spykids
I kinda miss the score in this movie xD it freakin adds so much to the movie.    So weird to have that taken off for this review. Still a great video!
omg i watched this movie so many times when I was smol... I've liked memorized most of the movie. the intro is so nostalgic wth lol
The amusement park at the beginning was filmed at Six Flags Over Texas which was the first six-flag amusement park.
I’m already getting ready for Alex watching spy kids 3
18:00 I think they were gonna turn off his wheelchair
do cheaper by the dozen
You can tell Alex had fun with the animation
Can you make a star trek epsode
I never understood this but if you can order the president at level 2 then you should be able to go on really good missions as well
I'm glad you touched on the greatest movie quote in the history of cinema lol
guys u think all these Netflix movies is getting to him? He is getting hard over thumbs...........
Literally almost every promo for this movie were jokes about Juni's watch: "This watch doesn't tell time?" and "I'd tell you but my watch doesn't tell time!"
Would love to watch you review Kingdom Hearts
11:14 I WAS EATING OVER HERE
Why do I have no recollection of this movie? I had to have seen it.
I used to watch spy kids all the time and thought that they were cool and now that rewatch them I’m like why did I watch this💀💀😭🥲
The God in heaven part was deep bro 🤣
This movies are My Childhood xD
Sometimes I feel like Sharkboy and Lavagirl is just an acid dream that I had as a dream, and Spykid feels like the same lol
Great video, been waiting for this one!🔥  You should really do a video game series!  something like, "Kingdom Hearts makes no sense!"
I completely forgot how insane this movie in particular was
Lol Island of Lost Dreams was my favorite Spy Kids movie. I love the dance/sing scene with Carmen and Juni.
love your vids!
Before I even watch it, I'm just gonna say it: don't you dare speak ill of the greatest spy franchise ever, or you too will live in fear of the rage you've created.
Now all that's left is do the final third movie.
This is how I feel about The Super Mario Bros live action movie. I’ll tell anyone how much I love that movie....until I actually re-watch it.
I took my cousins to watch this movie and I don’t remember any of it.
I mean I can't disagree with any of this. But this hands down my favorite of the 3.
Oh no, he is going to see "The Line". I can't wait to see how Alex reacts
Wait until he realizes that there is a fourth movie.
did you know the dinner scene was filmed at this outdoor part of the texas capitol?
I don't realize how weird kid movies are until we watch u
Spy Kids 1 & 2 had S tier casting for such silly movies, and it's their acting that really helped the movies from being the typical bad kids' movie and more of a genuinely enjoyable time.
Hey Alex! Please do a video on Euphoria!🥸
This was filmed at six flags?
Speaking of Euphoria, review?
Let’s go it’s a great day when Alex Myers’s uploads
Comments are back
You should definitely review Spy Kids 3: Game Over !!! I still remember the betrayal I felt when I watched it for the first time and the line “I never even got her email address” which is so 2003. I enjoyed how Carmen is lost for a lot of it and it’s shows Juni’s growth as a character since he is alone/not with Carmen for a lot of the movie. Also It has Sylvester Stallone and Elijah Wood!  There’s also Shorts (2009) which is also directed by Robert Rodriguez. It is an absolutely bonkers film and reminds me of the live action Cat In the Hat.
7:39 lmao
why did i try to tap the qr code
YouTube is blocking all comments?
12:34 Bill & Ted did it better.
I just wanna say warhammer 40k  is awesome ...
This movie makes just about as much sense as ketchup on icecream  In a shoe
Spy Kids holds up super well as an adult. When you are an adult you enjoy the campiness.
I am currently in shock that that “God stays in heaven” meme comes from this movie
Pls do young and hungry!
Know it couldn’t be more off-topic but YOOOO ALEX PLAYED/PLAYS KH??? BROOO
I just love the new floating animation poses great job of them👏
Spy kids 3 is actually a lot better than the first and second, so you should give that a watch(and maybe a video.)
You should do the movie Sleepover
Spy kids must do a lot of filming in Texas cause the amusement park is six flags and I remember in the third movie there was a small scene in a waterpark in texas
FYI there's four movies in the spy kids franchise. The fourth one is titled spy kids: all the time in the world
That meltdown at 13:53, and the Reading Rainbow theme kicking in, had me rotflmao
do the new cheaper  by the dozen
Ohh my god.... I loved this movie when I was little.. now I see it's cringy
Gotta admit... "Troublemaker Theme Park" Rodriguez really needed to shoehorn in his studio & studio logo for this movie? But, in all honesty, I loved all three of the Spy Kids movies. I still kind of do lol. Also, the fourth movie DOESN'T count in the slightest!
President's daughter is Cindy Lou Who
Make a Codename Kids Next Door video please
,,do you think god stays in heaven because he too is afraid of what he has created here, on earth"- is the best quote from any movie
The whoa dude part of the video was funny
I think Robert Rodriguez kids films are so cheesy and stupid that they become charming.
There was never a shark boy and lava girl 2
This was my childhood
please can you do more harry potter. And also might you consider doing the Fantastic Beasts Seires.
12:42 Hi Sonic Ivo and Rheneas (pronounced like Phineas), who's your new green haired friend?
Steve buscemi really sounded and looked like rusty cage in this movie
Rewatching these clips, I still love Spy Kids 2. You can't change my mind!
Please do spy kids 3 it's even more wild😂😂
Yo I forgot they fell in camel poop 🤣🤣🤣
it doesnt exactly help that the movie itself feels like there are A LOT of missing scenes after they get on the island, so many inconsistencies
Spy kids game over is my favourite one :DD
Anyone noticing that animation update- its looks so great!!!
Gosh, i LOVED this film growing up (more than the first). I wanted the living zoo so much, and it made total sense in my brain... The plot is fueled by the wild imaginations of the kids watching it
The president from we can be heroes is the same actor that plays the ceo guy
Next movie should be Dora and the lost city of gold
The fact that Megan trainor married Juni cortez😭❤❤❤ she's living my dream
Also... Continúe with the HP saga
LoveU alex but I wish you to take back the spanish versions
Game over please next 🙏 😫
This was my first favorite movie
Why do you always review live action shows all the time?
7:34 I hope *that* doesn't happen at the wedding I'm invited to
did you know the dinner scene was filmed at the texas capitol? learned that last week
Have you ever made a video about the Disney movie "Secret Society of Second Born Royals"? I actually think it was fairly entertaining, but I'm sure you can find something about it that doesn't make sense or it just plain silly.
Why? Because it is weird and poorly done, its the same as when we watch trash movies such as anaconda just cuz
8:16 *Pig Tail power activate!*  Yeah if I were that magnet man I'd be scared too.
👍🏻
There was a point in time where my brother and I watched this movie every other day 😂 it’s still my favorite of the spy kids but looking back…. Nothing at all makes sense and holy shit that CGI
If you want a weird kids movie, Another Cinderella Story starting Selena Gomez is the one. I loved it as a kid and still do but there def needs to be some explanation
Spy Kids 2 is my favorite, it's the best out of all of them in my humble opinion. But obviously it's not a good movie! It's a great movie for kids, just not for adults. Although I would definitely watch it again out of nostalgia. And because I love Antonio Banderas  Also I love Bill Paxton's cameo in this one. This movie ain't no Aliens but it was my joy as a Mexican child
9:31 should have been the thumbnail lmao
You should make a video on Grimm
0:21 And i guess you are still trying right? XD
last time i was this early, i still thought spy kids was good
U could literally have seen that it is not realistic i mean when they was in that temple ye it was bad
steve buscemi deserved so much better.
I have been waiting for this >:)
FINALLY… this is my favourite kids film ever
alright, say what you want about the film itself but let's get one thing straight here; buscemi is a national treasure & we are very lucky to have him
Early
Dude, SpyKids has BEEN insane. I still like it 😆
13:52 we LITERALLY made the same face 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Yup, definitely the most accurate adaptation of the Island of Doctor Moreau...
Why is Thumb Man all caked up on a Tuesday afternoon!?
Omg, the best I’ve laughed at your recent videos! Please finish the series!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼
"Do you know how to squirrel"
Do cat n the hat weird stuff man
I really hoped you made a comment on Emily Osment  ,you didn't disappoint
The fact that Steve Buscemi went from philosophizing about God in this movie to playing God in Miracle workers is truly mind blowing
The plot of spy kids 2 definitely made no sense I can't imagine the pitch meeting without an immense amount of adult substances
Alex’s reoccurring Sonic pining mockery is one of my new favorite things
The best description I’ve ever heard of the spy kids movies is that they’re exactly what playing pretend with your friends was like when you were little.
Spy Kids 2 is amazing, okay, it’s terrible, horrible, laughably dumb and iconic.   Also, sparkling milk, omg nooo🤢🤢🤢🤢
😅😅😅😅😅 ITS LIT!!!
Yay! I’m early!!!!
SPY KIDS THREE SPY KIDS THREE
DO MEET THE ROBINSON
uh
Spy Kids 3 is where complete insanity comes in.
8:19 Alex... bro, seriously at this point I just want to hang out with you 😂 The fact that these hilarious cuts are perfectly timed has me REELING 🤣   Okay after finishing the video, I gotta say... thank you. This entire thing was hilarious. Wtf was our childhood? Lol
That's some good plastic surgery that women got. It's not genes, it's great professional intervention. No shade or hate towards her but we need to stop passing along our compliments on celebrities aging great naturally when they are deploying their financial resources to keep looking good. Like i would if i could too but people are looking at that and seriously believing that it's products (usually one the celebrity is selling) that is getting those results.
Alex please I need someone to talk about the movie Shorts. It was about a magic rainbow wishing rock and braces(???) and then the baby starts talking at the end, that's all remember. I swear no one remembers it when I bring it up. I feel like I'm going crazy or like it was a fever dream from when I was 10.
8:25 Even as a kid, I thought that was hilariously stupid. And I still do.
A great movie to watch when you are sick and high on niquil.  I also remember I liked this movie, but not as much as the third one, for some reason. I don't really know why I liked the third one so much. Maybe because I had the game for the game boy?
"Nice to meet you, tired and hungry" still makes me laugh. Guess I just like terrible dad jokes *shrugs*
I enjoyed the first 2 spy kids movies and when i saw 3 and 4 when i was older i was like why did i like these films
Data Mega Man Legends took me on a nostalgia trip!
Wait...wasn't Minion the bad guy from the first movie? Or is each one of those...head...hand...things a completely separate personality. So you got Evil Genius HeadHand, Vigilante HeadHand, Little Bitch HeadHand and Chronic Master Debator. Guess one of the last two was in control in this scene 😆
Funny enough the first Spy Kids movie I every saw was this one ☝️ . Me and my siblings loved it
Spy kids 2 was my fave 🤗
Finally !!! I was waiting for this. I used to watch spy kids a lot as a kidand I always liked spy kids 2 better then the 1st one and I desperately wanted Alex to do a video on it.  So thank you.
Gotta love that intro👍
I've memorized the lines sky kids 2 almost completely because when I was little my mom took me to stay at her boyfriends house and he put sky kids 2  on repeat on showtime for me
YAY!
So was it intentional or a coincidence that you posted this video today when today is also the 30th Birthday of Daryl Sabara whom portrayed Juni for these films? 🤔
I can't watch this fucking movie without thinking about how the guy who played Juni has that picture of him and Meghan Trainor exiting a sex shop with a bunch of dildoes.
why is youtube trying to change the format of the comments?🤦‍♂
Trust me, it gets insaner, is that a word?
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR AGES
I think he just gets more and more funny every time I watch. Thanks for the awesome content!
I still can't believe Mr Ginger Boy is now married to Meghan Trainor
In my head Alex and I are best friends.
was this always this insane?
We gone act like we didn't hear what that lady said at like 1:40
I wish u talked abt the rubber band storyline. That he wears
The quote about God went way to hard for a spy kids movie
Alex's reactions are funnier than the movie 🤣
Idk why the physics of the juggler was the only part of this movie that I questioned as a kid
I forgot how wack these movies were
omg, love the improved animation
7:04 the fact that it changes in front of everyone
I like how all of the adults full on passed out in front of them, but they still needed Carmen to say "sleepers." Just in case we didn't know.  This movie is bonkers.  I still want a mini zoo though.  Don't @ me.
4:26  Reminds me of  "Do you ever had a dream that you um…"
Lol cool entrance 👏
I watched this movie every day when I was a child and never connected Gary’s strange laugh to the fact that his last name is Giggles 🤦🏻‍♀️
Can you PLEASE do more of the Harry Potter movies 🙏
u missed the MACHETE ELASTIC WONDER with other 999 uses
Funny that you mention Kingdom Hearts, because Sora is voiced by Emily Osment's brother.
14:00 questioning life
The door to their super secret tree house is terrifying. One moment of hesitation and you could lose a limb.
I laughed aloud several times. this was top notch Alex
the president's daughter was played by Taylor Momsen. She was Cindy Loo-Hoo in The Grinch with Jim Carrey and she's now the lead singer of the band The Pretty Reckless.
If you wanna see a weird Robert Rodriguez kids movie, you should check out Shorts. That movie confused me so much as a kid
...I was just too busy trying to understand literally anything going on in kingdom hearts."... as a hard-core fan of kh. I can attest to the truthfulness of this statement.
Can you a video about the kirby anime please?
it's Daryl Sabara (Juni's) birthday today! he turns 30. these days, he's married to Meghan Trainor.
264th comment ay! lessgo
Great review. I always loved the spy kids movies but actually they really do make no sense. Still kinda entratining
Did anyone see "Luna Lovegoods Spectrespecs" hanging on the wall behind Minion? 7 years before their first appearance in The half Blood Prince. thats kind of cool xD
Those are my favorite childhood memories you are laughing at. God know how many times I replayed this movie although I can see it's a lot cringe than what I understood when i was 14
Can u watch the CW superman and Lois?
As a 40k fan, I feel called out. ._.
I always find when I watch my childhood movies back again why my generation is so dang strange now
I watched this movie COUNTLESS times as a kid, wanted nothing more than to be a spy kid. I've watching interviews with the people who made these movies and it just makes me love them more. They're 100% corny, but I still find them entertaining!
Does anyone understand what’s happening in Kingdom Hearts?
"How much Benadryl they giving these kids?"  Greetings from the DPH community
o god this is a thousand times more hilarious when you actually think about how unrealistic it is
The 3rd one is a treat. It's my favorite of the 3, and even better in my opinion if u've watched the other 2 right before it.
Fun fact: the theme park in the movie is actually six flags over Texas
Don’t worry, I too was but a child too focused on understanding Kingdom Hearts to pay attention to literally anything else.
Not me realizing now that Little J was in this movie ❤️😱
I can't believe you hadn't watched this one, this is my favorite of the three
i can’t believe he recognized taylor momson as dan’s sister from gossip girl and not cindy lou who from the grinch
Hi Alex!
THATS WHERE THE MEME CAME FROM!?!?!!?
The female spy girl is my favorite she’s cute
How was this my favorite Spy kids movie?
Arcane next 😶
So true
Finally I've been waiting for sooooo long
Like the new background! Also am very impressed by the terrifying Sonic-Romero amalgamation that you managed to create! Absolutely horrific 👍🏽
*Spy Kids 1:* Great!🤩 *Spy Kids 2:* OK.😀 *Spy Kids 3:* What the hell did I just watch?😵 *Spy Kids 4:* Why the hell did they make th...😓/OH,LOOK,THERE'S JESSICA ALBA!!!😍Ok,I'm gonna watch this one just for her.🤎
L audio
You should see these kids grown up :D
You should watch spy kids 4 as well
Wow, Mr Roark is their Grandfather? Why are there so many celebs in this??
For a minute I thought Rusty Cage was in the thumbnail.
I was thinking about rewatching these until now…
fun fact, in middle school I used to love this movie, but reccorded it on the dvr and missed the first like 30 minutes for years before seeing the whole thing lmao
I watched spy kids 3 (the one where their in a video game) in 4th grade with my class eating those colorful peelable twizlers and i ligit remember having my mind melted
Nothing will ever be uglier than the Fuglies.
emily osment's twirling hair was ICONIC to nine year old me. i wanted flying pigtails so bad.
spy kids 3 is my fav movie from the series and i find it ronoc that the cgi looked like a ps2 game but all we got was a gba game
I found this channel yesterday and requested more spy kids this morning. You are all in my simulation.
You gotta do 3 and 4 now
The audio of the movie clips are really bad this time. Maybe try to change the audio options in the transcoder you are using to avoid that :)
Spy kids 3d next
You are aware there is a spy kids 4
Umm I am not a regular watcher but I enjoy watching your videos for ti,e to time and I just saw it but congratulations on 3 million subscribers
Anyone else just learning to predict which scenes Alex is gonna judge because we all can agree that those scenes too are dumb as well
The third one is the best one you SHOULD TOTALY watch it
Please do Spy Kids 3 and 4
He's got the whole world In his hands He's got the whole wide world In his hands He's got the whole world  In his hands He's got the whole world  in  his hands.  Goold luck getting that scene and song out of your head now.
I wonder if you know about the 4th one. Yes there's a 4th Spy Kids movie, but the less we talk about it, the better.
you should do backstage the disney show:)
The only thing I remember from this movie is the fall scene and "watch doesn't show time"
I loved the spidermonkey cause it was creative fior the time and Ben 10 hadnyt done it yet lol. I still think its my favorite of them all. And i like how the closest agents were called in first since they were already at the park.
was that a full metal alchemist reference?
I loved this movie as a kid. Sometimes I’ll look at my Apple Watch as say “my watch doesn’t tell time” and Carmen’s song at the end is as nostalgic and catchy as “Yvan eht nioj”
10:11 damn I was gonna point that out
Even as a 12 year old I hated this movie. I remember thinking it was super weird.
Yay kingdom hearts
2:01 its called being young alex. its been a while since your youth so i cant blame you for forgetting
I think the "lost dreams" was Romero's. He wanted a paradise and thought he created hell
The fact that I loved this movie as a 6 year old 😂😂😭
I can't get over the helicopter hair scene. Easily the funniest shit I've ever seen
Oof, the acting of the boy is _rough!_
Spy Kids 2 has that Legendary Quote! I think God does stay in heaven because he is scared or what he created who would've thought Sky Kids 2 is a Philosophical film.
how did those kids fall down into poop, up to their shoulders vertically...when the poop is maybe 2 inches deep?
I used to love this movie and the credits scene
Istg if he's gonna insult my holy childhood-
‘Do you think god stays in heaven because he too fears what he has created?’  Me whenever I watch Netflix
this movie makes just no sense what so ever you might aswell watch it backwards
I wonder if you would do a reaction video of kingdom hearts XD
If this movie was real, the "I'll make sure of it" line would instantly be a new meme format on reddit
I love this video! It gives me the feeling of having your best friend watch your favourite film... and enjoying all the weirdness!
Spy kids 3 is going to make you crazy dude
Awesome video as always man, you always make my day with them reenactments
Hello
I can't remember watching Spy Kids 2. I think Spy Kids was just one of those series that you rewatch over and over, but then years later you realize that there is a whole creepy fandom surrounding it that you missed and can't join this late in... No one else?...
I LOVED the Spy Kids movies! 1&2 was my favs growing up, and 3D was okayyy but I personally could’ve lived without! I didn’t even know a 4th movie came out in 2011 until like 2 years ago, and it was decent for all the drama it had between the siblings of the previous movies!  MORE IMPORTANTLY, you unlocked a memory I completely forgot! ‘A date with the president’s daughter’ was a movie I remember watching and kinda enjoying but it was SOOO long ago and i forgot about it! Now i need to watch it again…
Referring to Taylor Momsen as Dan's little sister from GG instead of Cindy lou was surprisingly hilarious🤣
That scene at the beginning was filmed at Six Flags Over Texas! I never realized that!
Here from 34 minutes ago
The random music scene during the credits was that strange mix of jarring and fun when I was a kid. I later learned that it was put in because Alexa wanted to try her hand at a singing career and Robert loved the idea of putting singing in his movies. Alexa didn't make it as a pop singer, but she did make her own cult success in the indie musical circuit.
spy kids 3 is the weirdest movie ive ever watched, but that’s what makes it a classic 😌
need woah dude on a tshirt
You have to whatch spy kids 3.
Hey Alex... There's a Spy Kids 4...You should review that...  Also, great video btw :)
14:00 had me laughing.
I loved this as a kid. The story didn't made much sense event then but like... The gadgets were super cool and the effects looked much better then. The idea of having a secret tree house that was basically a batcave where you could play around with your friends was a lot of fun.
This was so calming and I really needed a post like this today! Much love
Butterfly in the skyyyyy...
There is a 4th spy kids movie
Ah yes, the last GOOD Spy Kids film.
I tottally forgot what was the plot of this movie hahahha its so bad that my brain just vanished it on purpose
This series was literally my childhood, me and my cousin would play spy all the time. My dad even made us our own OSS badges and everything. Even watching them now and seeing how ridiculous they are still warms my heart and reminds me of how much I loved them growing up.
I saw Spy Kids for the first time in theatres and my mom was wearing the exact same dress as the spy mom 🤯 So 8 yo me was like, yep my parents are spies lol
As a kid I had home recorded VHSes of the second and third movies (but not the first), and I can tell you: "Spy Kids 3D: Game Over" is *even more* insane than this one.
Was waiting for this oneeeeee
Half an hour ago lol  I'm always late
i like that there is continuity in the movies, like they develop this sibling telepathy in this movie that still exists in the 3rd and 4th movie, things that are established in one movie still matter in the next, we love to see it
Okay but the song that Carmen sings during the credits is an absolute BANGER!!!
YOOOO KINGDOM HEARTS?!
Cindy Lou Who was great in this. Still blows my mind shes a rock star now
*Spy Kids 1:* Great!🤩 *Spy Kids 2:* OK.😀 *Spy Kids 3:* What the hell did I just watch?😵 *Spy Kids 4:* Why the hell did they make th...😓/OH,LOOK,THERE'S JESSICA ALBA!!!😍Ok,I'm gonna watch this one just for her.🤎
"Do you think God stays in Heaven because He too fears what He created" man you think you know what this movie is and then it just sucker punches you out of nowhere
I love Carla Gugino. My dad sees her all the time, he is a door man at a building she has an office at. I loved her in Son In Law. She hasn’t aged for at least 2 decades, but I honestly think she’s an unproblematic queen so time has spared her from aging lol
I have COVID and your videos have kept me entertained for the last 8 days, love your videos!
better animations???
You have no idea how long I've waited for this moment!
Romero: Do you think God stays in heaven cause he too fears what he has created?! ALEX: Proceeds to lose his mind questioning life
Your a youtuber who always makes me  laugh it’s awsome
I still love it's canon that Gary and Gerti's mom is Salma Hayek and their dad is Mike Judge. A power couple this real world needs .
please I beg of you watch shorts
hahahaahahaha!!!!!! I will never tire of your videos, you are SOOOOO FUNNY
Never saw the movie, but your video is hilarious. I’m going to watch it again.
I ised to love this movie but its so damn wierd lol
Can't wait for the third and fourth
Alex please , please , PLEEAASSEE make a video on the show 'Lab Rats'
My favorite episodes from you!  Are movies from Robert Rodriguez! Nice job doing the series justice
We quote this dance scene all the time 🤣
At least it's better than the new installment
Collect your, here in the first hour ticket right here!
Ah yes, I hear purple.
ahhhhhhhh i loveeee
Despite Nostalgia, these movies were absolutely insane
13:45 Dam that was deep
Bruh I just realized the amusement park that they use in the movie is Six Flags Over Texas. It’s like close to Dallas and where I live and I never made that connection lol 😂
I love the animates it's like anime
This is one repressed memory I didn’t need brought back
Hi
Why don’t they have the same two last names
Clocing divece man clocing
Yes, spy kids! I watched these on VHS so many times at my nans as a kid they broke. Good times. 😅
I can’t get over that someone managed to poison/spike every single glass of every single spy and not get caught   Y’all need to find out who did that and hire them asap, they might be better at being spies than the whole squad.
I love how all of us including Alex have had existential crisis’ over that “God stays in heaven” line 💀💀
Honestly I forgot how unashamedly campy these films are before I watched the video Billiam recently released on them. It’s kinda beautiful.
Do spy kids game over
Child Soldiers: Illegal and a war crime  Spy Kids: Completely fine and encouraged
I swear ALL the Spy Kids films are fever dreams, I refuse to acknowledge these as real films 😅
yay
e
No freaking joke. Alex, you gotta watch "Shorts" from 2009 Directed and written by Robert Rodriguez. It's so bad, it's  another kid's movie of course but the plot is wack.
Sheesh
This movie was my introduction to Steve Buschemi
whats star treck? Is it a star wars knock off. Keep in mind I am 18
W video
😂😂😂
The fact I watched this movie so many times as a kid thinking it was the dopest shit ever
Love spy kids makes no sense but still love it
It’s nice to rewatch a movie with Alex’s narration and criticism. You never realize how ridiculous a movie is when you’re just a kid watching.
I remember the music video from this movie. 13:52- Favorite moment with distorted version of Reading Rainbow theme song!😆 Deep man! 3:14 "..so she can go on a date with Will Friedle..." 😆 My Date With the President's Daughter"- loved that movie as a kid. That's some 90's nostalgia right there! Don't know if you could, but would you ever consider doing a video on that movie?
“Ah yes this sounds like Benadryl” literally killed me.
9 minutes ago!!
Hola, soy Dora
I recently introduced the spy kids movies to my 5 (almost 6) year old and she loves them, it’s funny showing your kids movies that you loved when you was a kid and seeing them enjoy it. That being said…I didn’t really remember the second one as much as I remembered the first and third (we don’t talk about 4 and beyond) haha
If you didn’t have a crush on Gary Giggles, were you even watching the movie? 😉🥰
The joy I felt to open this app and see that Alex has a new video up 🥺
This was my favorite movie as a kid hop you do SPY KIDS 3 and you should do a video about a 90 sitcom called SISTER, SISTER
Steve Buscemi will always go down as one of the realest dudes ever. I forgot the name of the character XD, but that quote "Do you think...God stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?" Such a deep cut of a line where you start to wonder if you're watching a Spy Kids movie.
"You think God stays up in heaven cause he too lives in fear in what he's created"  - Steve Buscemi
There should’ve been a Spy Kids Cinematic Universe. It was on the same imaginative level as Shark Boy and Lava Girl
Cool animation !!!!
Hey, Alex can't wait for part 3 !!!!!
Best vid ever keep up the good work love your jokes
this movie scarred my childhood XD
it keeps getting funnier. i can't take it seriously anymore
My childhood, my blueprint
Nothing in spy kids makes sense now that i look back at the series, and i still love it
Please do the TV show “psych” it’s hilarious
I can’t wait till he does spy kids,all the time in the world, it’s…actually kinda depressing and relatable
Here within 5 minutes!!
fun fact: kingdom hearts is about a game where hearts are in kingdoms
Hiiii will u do one one cats and dogs
yooooooooooooooooo
Did he see the 4th spy kids
omg is that Taylor momsen? I didn't know she was in this movie😲
13:45 - 14:05 I was waiting for this moment. Still can’t believe this mind boggling quote came from spy kids 2
I was here 96th
Never was this early to a video
Steve Buscemi was the best part, and takes this silly kids' movie seriously. He even says the line "Do you think that God stays in Heaven" with a straight face, a commendable feat!
Yes this exactly what I needed 😂
It's so strange how in our young minds we could follow almost the whole story but rewatchingit when you're older it's like "wha-what the heck is happening when did they get there"
Early
Fun fact: Spy Kids 2 is the only installment of the 2001-03 'Spy Kids' trilogy, in which George Clooney doesn't have a cameo in.
These videos are incredibly obnoxious. But it's okay because I'm bored and need a distraction 🦄👍🤘
lesgooooo
very cool video
Check out Turning Red. You'll be surprised.
I'm finally early
Always a great day when Alex uploads
The third was wired but the first one and second one was very good
YES EARLY
Bro the kingdom hearts joke 😭😭 nobody played chain/rechain so it’s so weird
I loved this movie so much
We live on a plate covered by a glass dome.
Spy kids 3 was the most confusing/ hilarious movie ever. It made little sense, like when they went surfing on lava. But as a kid it was so fun to watch.
When I was a kid I swear spy kids were actually real
E
Can you believe this film gave us: "Do you think God stays in Heaven because He too lives in fear of what He's created?"  LIKE FUCKING SPY KIDS 2. THE SEQUEL.
hey person reading this. collect your reading this comment award 🥇

Ive always liked the studio behind movies like this mostly because of how imagination defying and rebellious to normal movies they are
All jokes Aside, Spy Kids was honestly soo good ahhaha. 😂😂
