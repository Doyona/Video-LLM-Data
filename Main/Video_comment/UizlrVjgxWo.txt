What the heck have I just watched at 6.30am! 🤣 That was great fun, I loved it ❤
Met line does not go to edgeware road
1:56 Daddy Geoff 🤣🤣🤣
11:06 that is the old picadilly line moquette, not the new.
I'm fan
6:48 JEEENNN
Controversial, I think the trans are better than the DLR
1:58 daddy geoff😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
👏🏻
Great video!
Max probably mad cheese with the old socks
i did not know this happened
GPs behind closed doors music at the start 😍
10:32 couldn't believe he couldn't "swap" the socks.. what a party pooper haha
this video is another reason as to why i love being british
this was so entertaining. i need more of these two together
The collab we least expected!
With max CORRECTLY standing on the RIGHT SIDE OF THE ESCALATOR
"I just don't know what Max did with the three pairs of sweaty socks he inherited"  Maybe he made cheese?😂
this has to be one of the most unexpected collabs ever, a transit nerd youtuber, and a youtuber who just does anything that is not a particularly good idea.
There is a transit system in San Francisco named BART
The collab nobody asked for but everyone wanted 😂
Love the video Geoff. Its your city and we're just living in it. 10/10.
lets get this to one million
You got me @geofftech I thought this was a new video by Max!😅
It just made me buy the socks
This is everything I would have never thought I wanted
😂
🙌
Commenting for more reach
Purple train! Oh my! It exists?!?! Yes!!!
I did once have a weird bonding moment as I was wearing the Elizabeth line socks in a restaurant in Liverpool and another person was also wearing the same socks. It was very wholesome 😁
Watching this at Newtown train station
That's so Geoff
That was great Geoff! I love Max Fosh - such a likeable fella. So do I now search his channel for a street smart video with you in it?
I love the cushions, the sofa and the socks carpet in those designs would look great toom
I love the cushions, the sofa and the socks carpet in those designs would look great too
brilliant video
Wow - this video really knocked my socks off.
I just counted all the normal tube riders who look like they're very close to hurting people.
this is such a delightful video
is there a reason the overground socks didn’t really match the seat?
This was utterly delightful! Please do more collabs! Also, I see @thetimtraveller in the video description for music credits which is also fantastic!
really wonky and brilliant
If I lived in London I doubt I'd even be able to name all the lines
Aren’t they breaking the unwritten rule about no talking on the tube what’s going on??? 😂
this was so much fun to watch.
this video  is chaos and i love it
splendid work ! 😊
The sock swapping should be a TV game lol!!
Silly to the Max
Not Daddy Geoff 😭
The Orange Moquette is probably on some of Sullivan Buses.  will be on the Metrobus and Titan over at Ensign.
Imagine if there were normals wearing the socks during the sweep too 🤣
I do wonder about the contract Max inevitably gave Geoff to sign. There can't be a Max video on Youtube not involving a contract.
Geoff: gives Max his own moquette Next Max Fosh video: *HOW I MADE A NEW TUBE LINE*
I’ve always liked that orange, yellow and black moquette.
Hi Geoff   My 6 year son follows you. He loves your videos and wants to collect the new stations wallets. Please please can you do a trip with him- it will mean a lot.
I need TfL socks now
This was fantastic in a way I didn’t know I needed.
Confession: I watched the live you did with Match The Moquette on and I've regularly gotten the theme tune randomly stuck on my head ever since, toots and all! 🤣🤷‍♀️ Loved this video too! 👍
This is one of the best games to play I can't lie, excellent video as always Geoff and what a brilliant idea you made, created and organised 😁
Loved this.
Maxnificent!
what
This was a collab I never expected but is most certainly welcome. Great video!
This is silly to the Max! Loved it.
i love how max just goes for "lets find people who look like train people" to get the socks. it would have been funny if there was just a random person wearing them though
The London Transport Museum surely owes Geoff for a spike in moquette sock sales...
The crossover I didn't know I needed
weird that this video happened because you met at the edinburgh fringe when i met you both separately outside of the pleasance dome at this year's fringe lol
Super Moquette Sweep is probably the best pun I've ever heard
OMG ITS MAX FOSH WITH GEOFF MARSHALL LETS GO!!!!! :)
Now that’s my fav video on this channel …. U did up the ante on this one, didn’t you? Next time, if u r looking for some diversity in ur friends list… give me a shout out… 😂
Super Moquette Sweep is perfection.
This is soooo well adjusted to the guest. I love it :D
this is excellent. A collab I didn't expect to see but brilliant nonetheless
hahahah so much fun!
Thanks
Geoff your the best youtuber in the world
This video is pure GOLD! 😀
2:00 something odd is going on with the sound in the video here
Amazing video LOL
Max with his (well your) squad cracked me up 😂
5:40 Dale's dead Max. Too soon...
I love this collab.
Why is frank pick in the thumbnail?
the collab we didn't know we needed but we in fact needed so badly
Love to see a steam deck at 7:00
Mission failed Geoff to answer with "No darling, it's not the circle line, give it another go, what do you think it is?"
Ha what a video
There is another green line in South London (DLR)
10/10 sock advert, I'm off to spend obscene amounts of money in the museum shop...
What a brilliant idea and fun video 👍
Well this seems to have been a socksessful journey...
I literally have no idea what's going on here. British people are so weird. I love it.
TFL need to cut you a cheque for the increased moquette sock sales this vid will cause
Just brilliant.
What a brilliant collab! Did you have a show at the Fringe, Geoff or were you just visiting? Max's show was superb!
My two favourite YouTubers collaborating 🤩🎉
Some excellent wordplay - and a thoroughly enjoyable video!
Such fun wish I was there
Can we say that Lee has a magnificent beard.
Man If I was visiting London as an American and someone wanted to trade socks for one that looked like my seat I’d expect them to ask for money as a magic trick.
Love that you did this with max !
This was so much fun to watch, thanks to Geoff and Max
Brilliantly deranged! Love it!
Even the editing has been done in Max Fosh style - love it!
Oh guys how bloody British, so much fun, thank you
Daddy Geoff is having way too much fun in this video!
With that accent, of course Max has never been on the tram.
TWO KINGS
Geoff should have been the 6th sock wearing person
Round 3 is literally one of my nightmares. xD
challenge videos always hit difffff 💯
Best Collab on the internet ❤️
The collab I never knew I needed. What a brilliant video gents
What a completely random theme - love it !! - more nonsense like this please Geoff!!
Really interesting  video.👍🏻 Nice job.
That District '70s pattern was also on the Leyland Titan buses IIRC, could there be a museum bus you might introduce Max to? \m/
Superb video.
A great fun vlog near Christmas.  Just what many of us needed.  Great entertainment from 2 professionals.  Oh!  How much I laughed.  Geoff - your innovative approach to making programs  is so good.
You're nuts Geoff
I have ideas of my own bus, train, tube and tram moquettes.
Brill!
I wonder if that man Yerkes knew what he had unleashed when he united those first underground lines. It is now a playground for YouTube geeks instead of a transport system!
Didn’t even have to check the credits to know Tim did the music
Geoff and Max fosh two of my favourite youtubers doing a collab
My theory that all British YouTubers are no more than three degrees apart in terms of collaborations continues to crystallise
Brilliant, just brilliant!
Unexpected and amazing!!!
Amazing work Geoff! And also a great Xmas gift idea! Edit: the socks have sold out 😭
What a delightfully unexpected surprise
Well, helloooo Max. VERY nice to meet you *:*    *follows him*
I love how it’s obvious that Max watches Geoff’s videos with a few comments he made. Hope the collab brings more people to this channel.
The collab I never knew I needed
I love how your friends all decided to get involved and bent the rules this is amazing
Ooh is that future moquette really the moquette that will be used on the New Tube for London on the Pic/Bac/Cen lines?
Haha loved this! I wanted a pair of Elizabeth Line socks but getting them till Spain and pay customs for those... too much! Maybe when I am back in London.
Brilliant video Geoff and it looks like you both had great fun. I must admit I'd never heard of Max Fosh before but from viewing his channel I see he did the "Welcome to Luton Airport" stunt which I remember reading about on the BBC News website and thought was funny. I've had a look at his channel and looks great, so he just got a new subscriber too (I already subscribe to your channel).
What fun & games with a laugh!!! 😄😄🚂🚂🚂
This may be your best video yet!
Funny video,  Merry Christmas.   JH
Great duo, love to see future vids
Loved it something very silly British about it 🎉
I work at LTM and am a huge Max Fosh fan. Sad I wasn’t in on that day!
My all-time favourite Underground moquette was the red, grey, and black one which was primarily used on the 1962, 67, and 72 MK2 TS; as well as on the A Stock. In second place it's the roundel red, black and white one used on the O/P, R Sub-Surface trains, and the 1938 TS.  Many years ago the London Transport Museum began selling old Underground moquette designs in the form of cushions, upon inspecting these in person, I found that the fabric used for the cushions to be not moquette, it's way too soft thus very easy to cut with a blade, in other words customers who buy them are NOT being sold the genuine article, I wrote to the LT Museum complaining about this, but they haven't replied, go figure
Simply Brilliant!
The collab we didn’t know we needed❤ Loved this
Yay, so many great people in one video! Cooking youtube is collabbing, train and transit youtube is collabing, it's a great era!
Uber train geeks off leash in London. Love it.
That was hilarious! Fantastic thanks for that!
Best crossover ever
Most socksessful video to date. Loved it. Great fun.
"Everything's on the Tube Map now, Geoff!" 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
This episode just screams Cheese - it's excellent. Nice Video Guys
This was so much fun.
This was brilliant Geoff, loved it!!😁
A comedy gold challenge it was indeed, chaos ensued while travelling at speed.
Master class of a video 👏🏻
🔥🤣This was fun to watch
That was heartwarmingly silly 😍
LOVE THIS!
The collab of my dreams
Just love this video Geoff, must be scary asking strangers on the tube to take their socks off!! Great that you got such a good response. Merry Christmas to you!
Best collab ever
omg I wish I could be there but I'm in another continent 😭😭😭
This is superb. This is what all YouTube collabs should look and feel like.
A Geoff Marshall and Max Fosh collab in the same week as a Tom Scott and Tom the Taxi Driver collab is throwing together 4 of my (very obscure) subscribed channels in an rather unexpected way
I am obsessed with this collab
what a crossover!
Heartwarming community spirit - well done all!
Absolute lunacy, but brilliant at the same time  Congratulations on 300K subs by the way
“The Central line is my favourite”, said no one but Max Fosh ever 1:53
Omg this is fun
I love the fan type thing and the banter here is just pure fun. Go on, sock it to 'em. I wonder how the French do this sort of thing about the Paris Metro, if they do. A Tim type question I think.
Great video, had me smilling from start to end.
This is the BEST VIDEO EVER!!!!!!!!! Great job, guys. I ca watch this video for ever!
This is Barking mad. BTW Congratulations for the 300K subscribers Geoff 😄
Don't know the max but they are fun games you made for him
The Central Line is no one's favourite, let's be honest.
This is just brilliant! I love this! I would have swapped socks, if I was on the train!!🤪
Wow, what a fun video this has been. You've made my day Geoff!
"OMG there's a guy on the train asking to see people's socks."  On a serious note I wish the local transit agencies where I am merchandises their transit patterns.
From LeviNZ......just too much pure fun :-0...Pity I'll never get to London again....still... the new fabric ( not sure if it is tough enough to qualify as moquette) on the Wairarapa Line,,,with its lovely Mk 2 carriages. is an attractive blend of blue.
A really fun video. Well done Geoff, Max, all of Geoff's friends and all the folk who joined in on the Tube.
What a great video, love the referencing back to some 70's/80's TV shows.
never heard of Max Fosh before.
DADDY GEOFF
Yes well, what a challenge
This was funny, as soon as I saw Jen, I knew she would be wearing the socks
Good job Londoners are posh enough too wear socks!
He *loves* the Central Line? Is he a masochist?
This video was so fun to watch, Geoff, I couldn't stop smiling. Thanks again and happy holidays!
I am a bit disappointed you didn't find a seventh person wearing the socks.
My worlds have collided!!!
Like it I want them
this is just so silly, i'm not devout enough to the church to handle this XD
Absolutely epic collab!
Well done Max socksessfully completing the challenges! 👏🧦🚇
Most surprised for Geoff to get silly to the Max!
very funny
Fantastic! So fun to watch. Thank you, Geoff from Boston, MA.
An unexpected but brilliant crossover!
Really good video guys!
Unusual but creative ideas Geoff
It would have been really funny if Max had run into somebody wearing those socks who didn't happen to be one of Geoff's friends.
Exciting and wholesome. This has made my day.
this is the crossover to end all crossovers. 🤍
Need to see that Max Fosh Moquette in a woven form on Max’s The Silly Company store
this is the silliest video ever and I love it
Amazing Collab.
Normally with cross-channel Collabs I like to see the other channel, but “sweaty socks” is just not enticing.
This was so much fun!!!!!
had to check the credits ... i thought the music would be from @TheTimTraveller !
This had got to be the most entertaining video you've ever made!
This was amazing
That was something different. Looks like you all had a really fun time.
Man, you have a metro gift shop ?!? That's so cool, I would love for if my city had a metro gift shop ... or a metro system for that matter, but still, thats so cool !
Does Geoff own the Tube now?
Add Tom Scott for a three way collab for the most British video ever filmed
love these two
Weird crossover but I like it
A good Fun Video cheers Geoff and Max
A collab I never knew I needed! Love it.
Geoff, congratulations to you and Max for this Christmas tonic of a video. All the best for a manic 2023. We need you.
Brilliant! What more can one say?
I have been waiting for this for a long time...
I think that Super Moquette Sweep is the best thing I've seen for some considerable time.
Never comment but great video! Loved it!
2:25 can we please make this a ring tone
try super moquette sweep on the northern line in central london during rush hour
The collaboration I never knew I needed
do all obscure/funny british youtubers know each other
It’s more than just a collab between Geoff and Max Fosh - when I heard the arrangements of old TV show themes, I just _knew_ that Tim was involved too. :D
Such a great video!
Love Max Fosh! Thank you for this!
What's an absolute bonkers but fantastic and fun episode. Well done all.👍
Think more people would be inclined to say yes when there are multiple cameramen following Max.
First thought upon seeing the thumbnail: "Ohhh... No... Geoff hasn't teamed up with Max has he??? Oh, well, this is going to be one of the silliest videos Geoff has ever created. And I'm all for it!"
Great fun! Am I right in thinking you can’t actually buy the exact set of socks in the box? Can’t find it on the website. I also think the ‘new’ moquette was actually old Pic?
The fosh
I’m proud of myself for getting the old bakerloo line one correct hahaha
the crossover we didnt know we needed
the collab I didn’t know I needed, fantastic video Geoff and Max
Now this is silly to the max. The best YouTube combination!
This was by far the bizzarest tube related video I have ever seen on you tube, but amazingly funny and I can see myself watching this many times in the future too lol. And congrats on 300k subscribers Geoff, well deserved
Simply brilliant! Silliness... just because. Now I'm thinking Mornington Crescent and "I'm sorry, I haven't a clue!" Carry on! 😎
This is seriously the most fun video ever...
Now this is the content I’m HERE FOR! Great work Geoff, long time lover of the channel, appreciate you, loved this collab
Easily the most fun episode in a while... great video!
The fact Max Frosh has been showing up in my recommended videos the last couple of weeks makes this video that extra kind of great
Geoff had entirely too much fun doing those graphics and animations in this haha!
But socks are usually covered by long trousers!
THIS IS AMAZING.
I have watched all of your videos
This was a riot! Thanks!
Brilliant!!!
The duo I didn’t expect, but two of my favourite youtubers together… talking about tubes! My life is complete 😂
George from the Victoria line looks so much like Simon Clark I thought this was an unintentional 3-way collab for a while
Fantastic! And Max is so personable and a good sport
Fantastic video - very well structured video, like a show. 10/10 top marks
Low key amazing video!
Poor Max, but he did it! I never realized every line has its own moquette. Btw I had never heard of the word moquette. But with google translate I found out that it is the french word for "rug" in English! Next time in London I will definitely go to the London Transport Museum, and by a box of those socks!
¡Hola buenas tardes Geoff!    Brilliant!  Stay safe and well. Un saludo. Gary
Was super to meet you at the transport museum whilst you were filming! (the two of us are at 1:43 with our son's hand in the corner too)  Managed to keep the collab a secret and it was definitely worth the wait!! Thanks for a super evening laugh and yet another brilliant video!
Who is holding the camera Geoff?
This is fantastic !
MEGA !
Would love for Geoff to do something like this with Tom Scott
"Daddy Geoff" 😭😭
A whole challenge and not one pun on TaskMaxter...
:)
I would have swapped socks just the fun!!!
I kept hoping he'd find someone who was just out wearing their Elizabeth Line socks, but has no idea who either of you are.
This looked like a fun way for local riders to enjoy their day.
Such a joy filled video - you bring so much happiness with these videos.
One of your best @Geoff Marshall !  More, more, more!
7:44 Plot twist- there's a 7th person wearing them because they're not part of the game, they just think they're cool!
The comment, by Max at 0:15 and waving the socks around. Why?
This is absolutely bat sh*t and a love it
Absolutely bonkers!
You should have said there were 6 socks but only invited 5
That was exceptionally silly and I’m here for that 😀👍🏻
Fantastic video of actually two people who I watch and subscribed to but really entertaining and enjoyable
OK, remind me never to accept a challenge from you, Geoff :D
300k!!!!!!!!! 🥳🎉
feeling very pleased with myself for guessing old bakerloo!!
I've never been to the TfL museum but now want to buy the entire store. This is the greatest advert that ever wasn't
This is very silly.
The last orange and blue mouqette was made in Halifax years ago and was on the local buses in the Halifax area.
Jen had a pret coffee
You couldn’t get a more English YouTube  video if you tried. Even if you had made a video with the queen in.
This was silly to the max
so much love for this
As a 40 year underground user, I'm not entirely comfortable with the concept of encouraging people to talk to each other on the tube. Just seems "wrong".
More collabs in the style of the guest.   Can't wait for a "and if you have been, thank you for watching".
Awesome ep, you need to do this with all your friends. Loved it.
Thank you Geoff and Max for sharing the video that was very entertaining. You both are amazing.
nice
This video was exceptional. Love the 80s game show theme
It's so funny that he uses the Fosh background music in the Geoff format
I really liked this challenge Geoff.This video was amazing.I love when you do challenges like this.Your smashing this content Geoff.I love your videos always. 💜
Quite possibly the best crossover there ever will be
This is weird, and very wonderful, hearing the background music that Max usually has on Geoff's video
the colab i didnt know I needed
Looked great fun to make 🤣🤣
This has to be my most favourite YouTube video ever!!! What an awesome idea. Genius!! Hats off to you Geoff and well done Max for being such a great sport. Thanks too for the fun helpers.  And not forgetting the incredible moquette design team. Well done all!!!
Did Max recognise Jen?
You should have called the first game 'Moquette the Week'
Did I hear that right?!? "Daddy Geoff"!? OMG! 😂🤣 Oh my! I can already tell this video is going to be epic! 😁
Your videos always give me a deep down smile Geoff. Thank you.
Love your sneaky sock plant of Jen on the Move :)
fun!
0:08 Jen on the move foreshadowing
That was excellent.  And silly.  Especially silly.
This is the collaboration the internet needed
Congrats on 300k Geoff! As a person who watches both Max and Geoff, This was a really enjoyable watch!
This is exceptional
daddy geoff
Over the years I have saved up to collect the Slap bands with the different lines at the London Transport Museum, I finally got my last one this weekend!
Two of my best uk yt'ers collabing.
Absolutely brilliant video. I will be off to the LT Museum to get my own pair of socks next week !!
The collab we didn’t ask for but needed!
By the way, do you ACTUALLY know when the new entrance to Bank Station on Cannon Street will be completed
Never thought these 2 would connect, but I like it
Your best ever video Geoff. And what a sport Max was. Delightful.
Brilliant 👏😂🤣
A true Max Fosh moquette should have "Welcome to Luton" written on it
Dunno if I shod be impressed or depressed that I guessed the old Bakerloo line one for Round 1 correctly and got all of them right just from watching your videos...I live in Manchester, been to London once like 15 years ago
Geoff that was nuts. I love your work.
Love the incredible silliness of all this
Brilliant 😎
I was really hoping there would be seven people on the train with those socks...
The collab we didn’t know we needed
Puns'R'us ... a Sock-sessful trip ...
colab i never expected unreal geoff
We need a Collab of max fosh, Geoff Marshall, Jay foreman and Mark ( from map men)
Great recognises great.
You have done the all tube stations/lines in a day challenge.  As many are wheelchair accessible is there an equivalent challenge time for a wheelchair user?
the collab i never expected, but what I needed! Great work!
Is this the greatest colab ever?
This is just absolutely, completely and utterly glorious. Made my day.
I live in the US and haven't been to London since 2018 (thank you Covid), but thanks to watching Geoff for years, I got 3 of the maquettes. Well done Geoff! You're even passing on information across the pond!
This is brilliant 😂 Might gift myself some socks for Christmas now 🤔
going for the five minute crafts business model of targeting foot aficionados I see.
I have heard that a price comparison website is going to bring out their moquette - It's the  Compare the market meerkat moquette
Despite not being from London or living in London at all I have a weird nostalgia for the old yellow/orange/brown/black bus moquette. The company that provided the buses to my secondary school out in the Cambridgeshire sticks bought about 6 old London buses when they were phasing them out in the 90s, so the bus I got to school every day for 5 years had that old moquette on the seats. I was almost shouting when Max got it wrong!
I NEED more of this type of content. The mischievous vibes are so good!
Hilarious!
Brilliant!! Loved the challenges, so creative. Congrats on hitting 300k subs!!!
If ever a video deserves a thumbs up and a subscribe its this one! Subbed for a few year now, all the best in 2023 Geoff, one day I'll bump into you on the tube somewhere.
Yay for seeing Jenn on the Victorian Line…complete with coffee!!! 😆
Enjoyed this format, nice one Geoff!
I wouldn't buy a sofa or cushion with that material as it would remind me of how filthy the seats are on the Tube!!
Been to London last month (for the 16th time). In three days I used the Tube, Southern Rail to Croydon, Tram, Uber boat, cable car, a routemaster and the Overground. Oh, and I saw a car park in Morden
12:25 that Victoria line seat was so worn!
I hope Geoff brings other London YouTubers to do similar challenges on the tube
It's real funny how much of a fan of yours Max clearly is, he may not be great at moquettes, but he's watched a lot of your videos BDG.
I love everything about this blessed collaboration.
Well done Geoff! That was silly to the max!
Love your channel and maxs now you have done a video together this is brilliant also you should definitely do another video with max fosh once again brilliant video
Excellent video😂😂😂
nice to see the former London mayor candidates featuring here
Wordplay!
You've really outdone yourself this time Geoff
Why does this remind me of when The Food Channel stopped being about recipes and became a food game show Channel? 🤔😉🤣
Geoff, you are so creative.  What fun!!!
Super-Moquette-Sweep is amazing! I miss that programme haha
The very best of British eccentricity by all concerned, applauded by several observing passengers at the end. Bravo, brave gentlemen!
This is brilliant
Thats hilarious. Well done Max...and Geoff for coming up with the ideas.
Happy 300k Subscribers geoff
Gold.. pure gold :))
You can't keep Maximus Bucharest plus an entourage away from London fashion.
I love this Collab video, well-done Geoff
So you English people call "Moquette", the French word for "carpet", a fabric thing you put your bottom on. And we French people, call "Carpette", a doormat where we wipe our feet on. We should be more friendlier than that, event though you lost the last football world cup game...  Funny video by the way, lots of friendly people.
Max Fosh looks like what I imagine coffee YouTuber James Hoffman looked like as a teenager
Somehow I could never imagine doing this on the New York City subway. (Forgetting about the fact that NYC doesn't have seats like these.)
Future game show themes include Play Your Socks Right and Every Sock Counts, with a planned reality show called Opportunity Socks hosted by Hughie Green Line
great vid geoff
I'd never heard of Max before today...I still find it surprising sometime that channels with high subscribers never feed through into my feed. Wonder how many there must be, but this was certainly different. 👍
the collab i never knew i needed!
Never in my wildest dreams did i think we'd get a Geoff/Max crossover. In my mind they are now best friends.
Brilliant 😂
wowwwwwww that was unexpected
A new level of craziness, thank you
should have given him a bonus.......for doing it all on the same trip....
A definite bromance!
Match the Moquette is back! :D Well Max now...
Well! What an unexpected crossover! What I love is you found a way to sort of weaponize Max's utter willingness to shamelessly approach random strangers in public and ask them silly questions. :)
I love how Geoff uses tube whistles as part of the challenge jingles
You should do more together
Absolutely brilliant Geoff - loved every minute of this🤣🤣
This was a rather fun video. :)
Dale’s dead dawg 😦
I was not expecting this collab
This was a colab I wasn't expecting :D
1:57 👀
An assortment of 6 of Geoff's friends to help you with tube challenges is extremely OP
Fun video, i can see Jen yay 😎
That was really fun to watch during my lunch break. Amazing to find complete strangers to swap socks.
This has nothing to do with the video,  but I just excited about riding the purple train at the end of the month. Unless a passport strike cancels everything...
Editing was on point! Loved the video Geoff, your personality goes (unsurprisingly) well with Max's sillyness :)
i really njoyed this brilliant video
The lady at 8:11 was so dumbfound
This video didn't sock! Very entertaining Geoff and enjoyable
Would have been fun if a random person had been wearing EL/Purple Line socks too - who would have been more excited?
Congrats on 300K geoff!
When people ask me why I like trains, this video is what I'll send them
Wonderful! Love it.
Loved this SO much!
Bonkers. And Manumental at the same time. Love it!
I swear I remember watching this video for some reason, I think Geoff teased us this a long time ago by the way Geoff it's me SecuroServ Changed my name because it was stupid
are you wearing these socks? no your holding those socks!
"Daddy Geoff!"
I love how he’s just up for anything, I think I’d have refused the last challenge 😂
the collab we never saw coming
Love this!
That was brilliant. Cheered me up😄
Thanks!
Is everyone involved in the game now on the Socks Offenders Register?  ...I'm now going to see if the London Transport shop send out orders...need some moquette cushions for my home!
Because Max (and Geoff of cause!!) the hero london needs, but not the one it deserves right now.  This made me smile as I am on a coach out of London.
At 3:34 I was like screaming TRAM
Absolutely brilliant video I would of been game with the socks love my Moquette sock's
im amazed that this even works on the tube.. people talking to each other and stuff
So, Max now has a Maxette: A Moquette in his honour.
What a collab
This is the collab we needed!
Max Fosh and Geoff Marshall...a suprise to be sure, but a welcome one!
"Everything is on the Tube map now, Geoff.."  This is kinda funny because i just watch another video about what is wrong about the Tube map
Why do I always miss you guys on the tube!!!!
Great Video really enjoyed it!
6:56 The fact she has a Steam Deck is actually a bigger "hmmm" clue I think!
Not keeping some stranger’s socks. I feel a chill all of a sudden. #UnSocksessful
This was brilliant!
Great upload Geoff Marshall you are a legend 😊😊😊😊
i love thé title cards for each round daddy geoff
this was amazing ... off to buy some socks!!
Could I have asked for a better crossover? Congratulations Max for completing that challenge, and Geoff, really well done man, those challenges were way beyond seatisfactory
What a wonderful Christmas treat - Best collab of 2022!
Nice Video Geoff Nice to see you did a colab!
Quote of the Day: “I can’t remember who my 6th friend is that I invited.”
What a brilliant collab!! Congrats on 300k as well 🎉
Great video. Very wholesome. A collaboration that I didn't know I needed.
6:00 Geoff is my new favourite game show host. Also, the title cards are giving me life.
A crossover that is a ""surprise for sure but a welcome one ""  amezing stuff
Great cross over no surprises. jen has a coffee in her hand
5:19 Never forget this anthem.
what a great crossover, unexpected but great!
I may or may not have, at home, a 4 person bench in London Bus moquette and an armchair in District D78/Jubilee 83 Stock moquette....! They're such timeless designs!
Great crossover 😁 Geoff you definitely need to do bits with the normal YouTubers more ( not saying you ain't normal you know what I mean) ♥️
Well this is an unexpected crossover.
A Geoff Marshall and Max Fosh collab isn't what I'd expect
1:58 DADDY GEOFF? To quote George Takei: “Oh, my!”
More off daddy Geoff and Max
1:49 BRB SCREAMING MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD WAS ABOUT THOSE SNAPBANDS 🔥
So wasn’t expecting this collab, such a nice treat

Max and Geoff being fun and low-key chaotic all over London is a delight and it’s what the world needs.
The most unlikely collab and I'm here for it, brilliant!
A Geoff Marshall x Max Fosh collab is the vid I never knew I needed lol, amazing ty :)
“If it’s not a perfect Max.”   AND THE OSCAR FOR BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY GOES TO…
I’m watching… and I feel reminded of Match The Moquette back in lockdown on sunny Saturday evenings.  30 seconds later… MAX THE MOQUETTE
Another great episode!! Thanks Geoff and Max
Where’ve i heard of max before…..
0:30 If we don’t know the cultural significance of the moquette, what are we even doing?

Max the moquette is a good name lol
One of the best collabs ever that we weren't expecting!
