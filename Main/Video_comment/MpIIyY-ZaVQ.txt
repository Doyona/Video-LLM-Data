Steaken me by surprise just how many folks have been watching the videos lately, so to viewers new and old; thank you very much for your tireless affection…  I hope you enjoy tonight’s challenge (which surprisingly puts that Texan steak I did a few months back to shame 😆) and I’ll catch you on Sunday for the next!   ‘Til then, don’t forget to wear sun cream…  *Also, I fudged up the colour on this one...feck only knows what I was looking at...sorry :/
Too scared to eat the fat smh 🤦‍♂️
Passionate about wool! Lmao! Nice one!
That knife cuts like a spoon!
That's not a steak, that's a quarter cow.
2:20 bruh im literally 30 mins away not tha im from Wisbech 2:20
I was looking forward to this video because that fat looked so tasty and crisp, sad that you left it entirely but understandable considering the 2 and a half kilos of steak it was wrapped around.
5:53 What gives with the crappy butter knife to cut through 100 oz steak? They really done you dirty not giving you a decent steak knife!
A Rexy probably might just gulp it all haha
You guys call arugula, rocket?
Good Job Adam!
BBQ sauce on steak??
Your one funny guy 😂❤
fat is the best for u !
It's called a bed warmer
I love being called a ‘BEARDLING.’   A great moniker sir.
Damn they gave you a butter knife they should’ve given you an actual tool to cut it with!
The bed warmer on your back right, was meant to warm the bedding PRIOR to getting into it.  Definitely not for snuggling.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
you should have gone full on savage on it. saved time and effort.
I would really hate going in the bathroom after he did his business. LOL
Wish I could have a beard to be a member of beard army XD :,)
Why didnt you eat the baby? it is made out of meat.
love the staffs manners
the fat is the most tasty bit of that beef lol i know its a lot of meat to eat would i would still eat a bit of it as you usually have a desert i think you could manage a bit oof that greasy fat lol
no it don't make sense lol if you do it on your own you get 60 minutes but 2 get 45 minutes how does that make sense its a 15 minute advantage for 2 people
its actually cooked really good
Team of 2 35 mins solo 1 hour he said 😅
Artemas
Normally, I would never comment… but you should probably have your own cutlery set that includes a very sharp knife….  ;)
Wonder how much longer this young man has to live.😮😮😮
Why don't you get steak knives?  😅
A steak knife would seem like the bare minimum for eating this challenge.
Hi  why don't you get a sharpe knife.
You da man!!!
"It's almost the size of you mate" 2:10 was the cutest thing ever. The baby's smile brought a smile to my face.
" Gonna need plenty of lubricant to get this down" yo cmon bruh😂😂😂😂
That thingy in the corner would pre-heat your bed. You would remove it before going to bed 😊 Good dating, btw. A true work-out!
Lol ive watched several of your food challenge videos and all are pretty awesome but this has to be one of the top 10 most impressive eating challenges ive seen. Lol that steak was huge lol.
Dip your steak in salted sour cream
The Warming pan was used to warm the bed before you got in it.  The chambermaid would push it between the sheets then remove it from the bed.
Why not ask for a bigger knife?
perhaps a waffer thin mint to finish!?
Why didn't they give him a steak knife?
How the hell you maintain your weight mate? @BeardMeatsFood
Need a sharper knife
At that point I'd have just picked the meat up n eat it as I went.
Growing up in New England I can tell you steak got very boring. As an adult I never order it, and am shocked what restaurants charge for it.
the background feels so calm
They needed to provide a steak knife 🔪
You need to start carrying your own razor sharp steak knives or have them cook it rare. A piece of meat that big is harder to cut and chew when it's done that well.
This place is no longer doing business. What a shame!
"Timer starts when you cut into the steak." Me: *eats all the sides first*
All I am saying m8 my Favorite parts the fat gristle is an insult good video i guess
I miss back of the car
Why do all these pricks give you a butterknife in these steak challenges? Like ffs, you're a place that serves steak, you should have steak knives
That steak looks god awful
I’m mad he didn’t eat the fat, that’s the best part
Lovely Ladies , my Mother and Auntie used to knit .
The only time I have seen folks from G.B. wearing flip flops is when my relatives visited me when it was 110 degrees here .
100oz of steak in 1/2hr😂😅😂😅
What a Beast!
My God. That Thing is Scary!
Beardlings. Classic!
The timer starts as soon as you cut into the meat so if you eat the other stuff first they wouldn't start the timer.
8:30 & 10:03 ok these were funny😂😂😂
You need a battery steak knife for those challenges
This dude was almost done in 15minutes 😂😂😂he's not human
did you use a butter knife that whole time?? no wonder your hands hurt 😭
Rump steak?  Was it reasonably tender?
Wow😮
I love you.
You're Soo Sexy Mr Beard!!! 😍😍✝️
Looks like a BNP rallying spot!
Never ceases to totally amaze me. I ate 37 taco kit tacos one time.6 soft shell and 31 crispy ones⁵⁵⁵
Trim your damn steak restaurants! I'd be so pissed if there was so much fat on ANYTHING!
That fat rind is making my mouth water: flavor left behind
Great example the manager is setting with his footwear..🙄
They gave you a butter knife? 😭
Why did they give you a butter knife? 🥺
Why they give you a Butter knife to cut Steak?
100 Ounces! Yowza!
I will eat all that fats..for sure
“Indicates my state of mind” 😂😂
Its crazy to me they only give you a butter knife 🔪
What a lovely establishment. Great energy, lovely room in daylight, as well  candlelight, transformation in eves. You rock mate, rockin' ur zipcode amongst theirs.
you put the bed pan in and warmed the bed then took it out when you got in you plonker
get yourself a battery operated carving knife lol i don't know why you don't use one
that fat looks like the best part to me lol
that fatty bit looks bloody lovely no wonder i have had 8 stents in my heart a 3 way heart bypass and 2 strokes as i would still eat it lol you can see the juices bubbling and it looks nice and crisp
how is 60 mins for 1person making sense when 45 minutes for 2 that does not equate you should be getting half of 45 minutes not a 1/3 your losing 7.2 minutes
@beardmeatsfood when im old and dying in the retirement home, this willing be my last meal. Cause ill willingly die afterwards
The fact that they serve a 100oz and not provide a proper steak knife is wild lol
Man.... not BBQ sauce.... use A1 or Hienz 57 sauce.... but not BBQ sauce.
Bro im trying to read comments and the advertisement kicks me out of them F you Ouy tube
Chris Evans with beard 😅❤
Looking at Google, The White Hart has already gone out of business. 😭
Is that a bloody butter knife lol
It would be easier without the butter knife I'll bet.
That pan that is on the wall, that you are correct is meant to warm up the bed, you would put hot coals in the round but and then you would stick it in the cover to warm it up, BUT!!! the thing you did get kind of wrong, is you don't sleep with it in the bed, it is just meant to warm up the bed before you get in, so you would put it in there about 5-10 mins before you get in the bed, then you take it out and get in a nice cozy warm bed
The thing in the background that you mentioned was used to heat the sheets in your bed, it didn’t stay in the bed.
That looks dry and tasteless.  Could have cooked that better.
I bet this guy has the best shits
Where the fuck does it go
Real Man eats the fat
You would have better time if you were to STOP TALKING 👄 AND EAT.
Get a knife 🔪 that will cut the steak.
Crazy mate. Simply crazy.
I.m in norfolk how cool
The server at the start or whoever you spoke to was an absolute rude wankstain
VO Adam it's wrong. It's 45 paired up and 1 hour solo.
sorry, but the steak looks like a hard sole. Was the steak specially cooked well done?
Please start putting your hand up next to the meal you’re eating rather than having the camera right next to it because it looks gigantic. Maybe use your hand as a reference of some size comparatively
I love meat but that's tooo muchh meatt 😂😂🎉🎉
Of course your arms are tired they gave you a butter knife to cut the steak.
Even more impressive was managing that with what looks like mildly serrated butter knife 😅
steak is like leather.  better you than me.
🐽
I used to work there 😅 sadly closed down now
I am glad that you didn’t have to eat the Fat.
I'd love to go there simply for their hospitality x that's lovely x
You mention "ambient temperature" in like 5/10 videos haha
eat the FAT, soft-lad.
You are amazing!  I am Hungry Every time I watch You.
You should have to eat the fat mate. Its a roast they call a steak, not fair. You did it so props to you.
I enjoyed it aloty ❤
Adam Bravo ❤
Getting the meat sweats. LOL your awesome
Wanker
How tender was the steak???
3 kilo steak to the non BeardBrexit fans....
I want that fat 😛
The fat!! I haven't watched till the end yet, but you probably don't eat it which is a shame, because that fat is the best part imho
Red meat has absolutely no fiber. You must have bound up for days. Hope you weren't. Fantastic job!
Well done you.👍👍 The item behind is a bed warmer, you take it out before getting into the bed.😂
THE GIANT STEAK CHALLENGE MEANT FOR TWO | WHITE HART'S 100OZER | BeardMeatsFood 100oz of pure cow, cooked to your liking and accompanied by chips, salad, onion rings, tomatoes and mushrooms...  BeardMeatsFood LOVE LOUIS SHIRLEY
Medium steak is much easier to cut.  Just sayin'.
You are so incredible,  I don't know how you do it, I think you are funny, and you have such a positive and friendly personality. I would love if I could hear back from you it would mean so much to me,
what a beast of man, my hands down and hat off
wow that chocolate fudge cake looks amazing
i love meat as much as the next person hmmmm what yo mean by that beard
That steak looked like it was a bit tough, yet cooked nicely. I've been able to polish off a 1kg burger before (That was just the patty), with fries and 2 large milk shakes. That was in my early 20's. I doubt I could do it now though, at 39
That fat is a challenge all by itself😂
Ordinarily I would be devastated to leave the fat uneaten, it’s the tastiest part. But I’ll let you off on this occasion
The fat is the best part
Google maps . This guy is a re tarded
What I can’t understand is, if fat is so bad for you to eat, why do people have so much of it on their bodies for all to see.
Carry your cutlery a knife and fork
02:05 I really thought you were going to say "Get in my belly"
2 "Person"?  Take a Golden Retriever.  You'd be done in under 8 minutes.
A steak knife would help. Not just a butter knife.
Why the best part left behind the Fat? is it that count leave fat behind.
This dude is not normal 😮
Bro smokes weed and come
He admitted to being a PIG😅😅😊😊😅😅😊😊
What does he yell before he starts eating?! I cannot figure it out!🤷🏻‍♀️
Rip plumbing
didn't eat the fat = fail.
I wanna know how long that steaks been sitting in their freezer, it’s not an average size cut so how old is it?
I hope you didnt have to eat the fat! 🤮
Hay m8 i have 2 ask...... is it hell when u go for a shit after these challenges? 😂
Amazing job bro, you finished it in ample time..❤
Nice staff for sure 👍🏻
Do you usually vomit the load out after winning the challenge??
Don't know how his stomach can handle almost 4KG of stuff in it.
this is far from a steak it looks ugly
I know im fat when I think that I could easily eat this in 30 minutes by myself
❤
4:03 As a pair, you get *45* minutes to finish; as a solo, it's *60* minutes to finish.
Thats impressive
Not to keen on the fact you weren't offered a steak knife
Beard doesn't like dunking milk and cookies, its an American thing. And then he pours cream on cake i never saw that 😮 but, definitely  Not better than dunking.
gerçekten bitirdi , insanüstü bir deneyim bu !
Great effort BMF.  That is worthy of being renamed to the Beard Meats Food Steak Challenge. 👍
That seemed small for Beard. 😂😂😂
Awesome beard ❤🎉😊
Best I done was a 1.4kg T bone and a family size .
How did they not give you a proper steak knife for that?
rock on big brotherr!
"Come into your steak" that's a knew one
I used to eat 3 cows each way going uphill both ways to school…
Adam said 45 minutes like 3x. But it was an hour!?. He forgot to edit that 😅
Norfolk chance steak challenge made me laugh
Just eat the fat already😂😂😂
Late to the party, but it's nice to see a challenge where they didn't overload your plate with fries aka chips.
Amazing challenge smashed.  I didn't think you'd do this one. Well done 'Beard , 'Top Effort' 😋🥩🍴👏🏾👍🏾.
Where is peoples
supposed to smash the meat bite into the fat
45 for double  60 min for single person
did you take fibre pills after? no way you got away without a constipation.
This proves in the bagel episode he took a dive so the owners didn't have to pay.
why not to ask for a better knife
Meat was overcooked
I believe the thing behind you is a popcorn popper.
The fat is the best part!!!!
I'm always amazed at how much you can eat and without passin out 👍🤘🤘 Big Fan, always totally cool 🤘
Fuckin love ur shoes dude 👍👍🤘
I believe it's called a bedpan; filled with hot coals to warm bed then removed before sleeping.
I thought he said 60 minutes for solo
During the intro at 4:04 minute you got the timings wrong Beard !! It was 45 mins for team of two and 60 minutes for solo right ??
Dude, you a beast
You don't put sauce on steak 🤦🏾‍♂️ especially bbq wtf 😂
you sweat from that butter knife
Get in my belly! It's a wee little baby.😂
your fingers hurt? ahh, well now your back's gonna hurt. cuz you just pulled landscapin duty
This might be the most impressive win I’ve see from Beard yet.
You love to laugh at stuff ‘you’re saying’ in your commentary.
You should meet Matt Stoney
A rump steak? England you really should be treating your customers better. We use that for stew or chili meat, not as an actual steak. Go with some ribeyes, porterhouses or NY strips.
That's not a knife... THIS is a knife ,,🔪  That's ridiculous, it's like a butter knife
That things ridiculous. The big Texan is 72 Oz. and almost kills people
I've watched a ton of your videos, great content! Can anyone tell me what he's saying before starting most of his challenges? I can't figure it out for the life of me! lol Keep it up BMF!
That is absolutely phenomenal 😮 but fare play beard 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Why well done? Seems like it would be harder,I’m sure you know more than I do about that though😂
2:09 lmfao
That thing is called a "bed warmer" and it was just used to warm up the covers before you got in bed .  It did not stay in the bed.🎉😊
Jesus that was one over cooked steak!
The flip flops would have had me second guessing the standards there lol
2.8kg steak? what the actual fuck
They could’ve given you a better knife
The hostess at the beginning was being a real twat
Ending credits sounded like classic 👌 street fighter music 🎶 on Sega ha.....
The Norfolking Chance Challenge lmao
Watch uncle buck the great out doors with John candy that will help you for the next one 👌🏼
That steak is as big as your thorax  😅
I’m in a meat coma just watching you eat that monster steak so quickly.
I thought it was 45 minutes, so 7 minutes remaining iso 22 ... did I miss something ?
I think thats why sheets were invented. You put the hot coals in the bed pan under one blanket or sheet the get in on another layer so it's not directly touching you
I would say even for the 2 person try that has to be a record time
Those deep breaths always make me think you've hit the full tank meter.
Never really been into sharing. !!! Lol
"do i have to eat the fat" is like saying "do i have to eat the most delicious part of the steak?"
Got the meat sweats just from looking at the steak!!
How could you waste that fat
The kind of guy who can win the match when the rest of his team goes afk
Why didn't they give you a steak knife?
They gave our poor boy a butter knife for a 100oz steak
Chutzpah…❤
Might have been easy to cut with a steak knife.
They should have given you a quality knife - 12 cuts per piece is silly
Is he even enjoying the food?)😂
How much was the dish if you didnt finish. That’s over 6lb of meat!
The fat is the healthiest part of it!
I thought the fat was bread
The bed heater in the corner looks like a banjo with no strings❤😊. Great video as usual🤣
That baby is so cute ☺️
I ate a 100g steak while watching this video but I couldn't finish it.
im full just watchng you eat.. 😂😂
That was probably the best opening line I’ve heard. The challenge is meant for 2 but I’ve never been into sharing
The pan just warms the sheets, it doesn't stay in the bed.😊
they could have given him a steak knife
"Your fingers hurt? Well now your backs gonna hurt, cause you just pulled landscaping duty. Anybody else's fingers hurt? I didn't think so". Name that movie.
The fat is one of the best parts wtf
"The great Outdoors" vibes
100 ounces = 2.8 KG. WHAT
Love the way you say "water bottle" the accent is killer. Always enjoy your videos,  cheers❤
That's not a steak, it's a ROAST!
You need to get an electric kitchen carver. I think they have the battery operated now that’ll chop up your meat challenges like the Dickens.
yes it is a bedwatmer lol  at the foot of the bed dont put it near the top....burny burny lol
That's  the Kindle of job i want to do.😮
Steak fat is delicious 🤤
The Fat is the Best Part
overcooked AF
My mrs introduced me to your channel, we live not too far from this place and just looked it up, looks like its closed now 😢
Fake...  live audience😂😂😂😂😂😢😅
This is probably the easiest steak challenge ever
How in the world did they not even give him a proper steam knife
Can we get head povs
That Steak looked so good but overcooked. I definitely wouldn’t have wasted the fat because that is like butter with every delicious bite of meat.
Bro acts like a princess now a days 😂😂😂
I'm convinced that he only takes one bite of dessert.
Why doesn’t he ever take his own cutlery and paper roll 🧻 with him on these. The steak knives are never adequate for what he doing.
still dont understand the Chips thingy - its a fries ... lol
I would be eating the fat first I love fatty steaks!
6 chips..
He probably take a crap afterwards.
How the heck he eat all of that food
you got this... you have handled worse.
beardlings. i should make a list of my youtube channel club names.
Leaving the best bit... tsk tsk.
Merciful you don't have to eat the fat
Koo
They absolutely cooked the shit out of that steak. It should be a crime to serve someone that dry ass thing.
I can not even imagine what your morning routine looks like! Thanks for sharing
2025 April 4 th  1:44 am  They would probably give you  Or bring your own sharp knives  To cut down on the cutting time ??  I would hope if it doesn’t break the rules
The doggo menu is awesome 😅
Foyer, Foil? It's FOIA or FOY-UH
10:35 the eyebrow 😭😭
Good morning ... ADAM xxx Beard meets food ... well done on this challenge xxx ❤❤❤ epic steak xxx I was just thinking that when you finish your challenges, you always get a dessert so why not let a random customer pick your dessert for you xxx might be fun xxx
Beard, King of The Ring!
The fat is my favorite part!
It's killing me that they didn't give you a steak knife for that. That's crazy.
How 🤯
Bro ate the cake and my brain is like “omg that cake looks so good”
❤❤❤
But the fat is the best part. Disappointed.
That steak is way over cooked brother
100 Oz steak with zero steak knife wtf
this is the first time i've been disappointed in beard meats food. that fat is gold and you abandoned it. love your stuff btw.
What a BEAST!! Unbelievable.
Adam where are you putting this at? Simply Amazing!
They should give a steak knife at least that’s sharp for the challenge
The fat is thee best part dude
Mask the pig a bit 😂. Be nice to see you in the Land Down Under doing a challenge 🇦🇺. Keep up the good work. Hi to Lindsay 🌹.
What a crybaby, step up and be a man!
You gotta eat the fat and gristle ! Cmon man !!!!
"Vociferous, "occlude"...great use of the English language mate!
Now I really want steak.
I bet that splash of chocolatey sugary sweetness after such a rich meal would genuinely relieve a fair bit of the pain.
Yes it’s called a bed pan you fill it with hot coals and slide it up and down under the top sheet and blankets it’s the pre curser to the electric blanket
Bit late to the party, but thank for mentioning me Mr Beard! Haha! 👍✌
I thought he said 45 minutes twice then said see you in an hour? Which one is ?
I thought that guy said 60 min.
I’m a butcher, for your next big steak challenge, you should bring your own 10” butcher knife to cut everything up easier and help break thing down to steak bite sizes. Would save you loads of time compared to using the shitty house steak knife. Thanks for the entertainment mate! I’m trying to bulk up and you are fun to watch :) best of luck in the future 👍
I can do that sooo easy lol take me a month though lmao 😅
nice shoes
I think a sharper larger knife would help seemed to be a lot of work going on there trying to cut it up.
A butter knife for a steak?!?
I would ask him to frap the fat while i'm eating the meal and then eat the fried fat at the end
Dude you are talented 😂
You should BYO steak knife. Also, I want that rind. You keep the rest.
Damnnnnn
Cmon at least have a real steak knife for the beard
"People say I never do collabs."  🤣 A collab with the local knitting club.  I think you can safely add that to your list of firsts.
"doggo menu"? Yeah...society is doomed.
Decent staff.
WE HATE mushrooms!!!!
GOooo BEARD!!!!😮😮😮
I like your  ring. Lol😊😊
Mate you must get yourself a nice sharp Joseph Rogers pocket knife that you take with you. Pretoria South Africa
None of your jokes are ever funny bro.. stick to the eating.. ur great at that
Why don't you use your own knife and fork.? ??
“ brass pan full of hot coals beside you doesn’t sound safe”…. Neither does freezing to death 😂❤
The interior looks like Gordon Ramsey will do amakeover tomorrow 😮
Baby so cute
Hell Yeah Brotha That's DEADLY.  Enjoy the Content you Post
The amount of kind people you meet is almost as amazing as the food you eat! Love the channel!
went from 45 to 30 minutes for 2 and from 1hr to 45 minutes solo??
Can we get this man a real knife... ik im 2 yrs late
you heat the bedsheets up....then remove the hot coals before you jump in bed.
It would take me a whole hour to just cut the steak, nevermind even get to the point I could start eating it! The fat is the best part though,  mate!
Pretty lousy knife for a steak like that 😅
That is NOT a steak, that is a roast lol
This beautiful soul makes everything look delicious 🤣😊
Need to ask for the chef’s knife
I have a question bro? Have u ever lost a challenge? U are a pro on this , i try to eat fast but my habit does not let me 😅
i know im wrong. but i feel like i could eat that. ive done a 50oz steak and had room for pudding after.
Keep cutting the fat off is not 100 oz steak
£50 for a 100oz steak and sides sounds like a good deal.
The shits you take after one of these challenges must be straight up terrifying.
if a steak is done right the fat is the best part
For some eating large quantities of food is challenge and for some getting food for sustainance is struggle
That knife they gave you is such a let down for the size of the steak
Who serves rump steak? Thats low and slow meat.
Cute baby
Why are you not eating that fat? That’s the best part you don’t eat a big clump of it. You just cut it in small pieces and eat it with the meat.
nice that they gave you a normal amount of fries too... too few, actually, for 2 people and that much meat... you dodged a bullet there on the fries and shrooms
there is not that much fiber in that little bit of salad (which is why you need the psyllium capsules) and there is not enough calcium either (which the Betaine HCL with pepsin will have)... meat is acid, if you don't eat enough alkaline veggies with the meal, your body will leach calcium from your bones to neutralize it to keep the blood pH balance, so you do need to worry about osteoporosis (and Tums is not the right kind of calcium anyway; and you need calcium in balance with a non-laxative form of magnesium).
it was nice to see they only gave you about 1/4 of the mushrooms other places give... I can't imagine anyone wanting to eat that many mushrooms... maybe 1 or 2 like a garnish...
you really need to take Betaine HCL with Pepsin, digestive enzymes (about 12 of them) before that much protein, and then take about 40 psyllium capsules and 4 glasses of water after the meal...
that much bbq sauce would make me sick all by itself... maybe some blue cheese would go well with it... or plain sour cream... and some ketchup (which you don't seem to like) on the fries and onion rings...
WHAT A RELIEF you don't have to gag on that fat... God forbade fat, blood, and certain animals for a reason... you overtax your body by eating such vast volumes as it is, no need to make it worse and transgress too.
After seeing this video, king charles knighted him. Henceforth beard shall be known as sir loin of beef from county ribeye.😂
That why stake knife were invented.
I love the fat parts if they are cooked right. I think it would help with the taste.
Worth a 2nd watch
As I'm sitting here eating my rice and steak burritos I'm wishing I had a little bit of that fat to stuff in my burrito for flavor😂
It's crazy how he got all the allotted  times wrong and the amount of people who finished this in the narration where this should have been fact checked lol
You need proper knife to eat this. Consider Spayderco ParaMilitary 2 ... well sharpened to 3000 grid.
How can they sell a steak like this but not have steak knives for customers LOL
I've been watching Adam's videos for a while now, and I have to confess this was one of his biggest challenges. What an incredible performance!!🤡!!
Are you using a butter knife to cut the steak?
You think theyd give you a proper steak knife. Love the content mate.
Hey there, long time no see,I hope you don't have to eat that fat!!!!😳😳😵‍💫I know you are going to conquer it anyway 👏😉💯👍
If you watched the classic movie the Great Outdoors he did a steak challenge but they mage him eat the gristle!
Ahahaha! I draw the line at babies!🤣
I got hungry and full just from watching 😋😁
My 3 kids were all born smaller than that steak
Given what I’ve learned watching BeardMeatsFood videos is that if I’d ever invent at challenge it would be massive amounts of fries, onion rings and salads…
part 2. . .  beat your own record 😍 i know you could do better 🎉🎉🎉
why tf did they give you a butter knife for that big ass steak??
Beard sir, You always cry about how much your fingers hurt. I've seen you pocket and bring a fork to a ramen place. Please just get yourself a really good sharp knife for the steaks! Steak houses give you their years-worn ass little steak knives, meant for people eating an 8 oz steak. We come here to watch an eating challenge, not a hand strength challenge.
That's not a real steak knife. Poor fingers
People say I never do collabs. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fats the best part of it 😊
The fat is the best part.
Absolutely awesome. What a nice guy 😊
Arthur C. Clarke sent me here.
They didn’t put the pan in the bed when you are in it…..they sweeped it around the beds of the house before you got into it to warm the sheets and blankets prior to getting in!
Easy win, it’s snack size for beard
to put this in perspective 100 oz equals 6.25 pounds.... so in total that is close to 7 piunds of food
A butter knife though? Why are they always sabotaging these food challenges xD At least you got some silverware at all at least! Most dont even provide that.
Wait...do you have a different site for the music videos you do? I  got to see the apple pie one but would love to see others!
Atleast it wasn't a load of crisps😮😮!!!!
How much protein I wonder just in the steak vs how many calories you burned just chewing the steak
4:07 lies!!! The guy who was explaining it said 45 mins as a pair and 60 mins solo. lol
he just ate 700 grams of protein
That steak is the largest steak I have seen in life cheers, mate
Ask for a kitchen knife while dealing with a giant steak challenge next time
bro,you are the black hole of food 🤣
Lol debating textiles
My mouth is watering 😋
100 oz food challenge..
What a collab 😅
👍👍👍👍😜
The Ol' 96er
Bro you need to bring your own knife
Well done Adam , from " THE BIG FAT IRISH BLOKE " .
Adam the fat is the best part of the steak
All that work and no actual steak knife. Brutal on the fingers. Lol.
Just cut in chunks and eat with hand
Lol beardlings.. nice!
When you’re not stepping up to a challenge do you eat normal daily portions? Cheers 😎
Bro, legit question do you need to use desensitizing lube for your ass hole to shit out this size of a stake afterwards? 😆😆😆
When doing a steak challenge how come no one asks for a big knife or a big fork for carving it? Or is it not allowed?
A good 👍 steak knife 🔪 😋 would help 😂😅 ❤❤ 😊 great videos Beard ,❤❤ cheers 🍻 from Australia 🍻 🇦🇺 😀 ❤❤😂😅😊
A dog on a menu is an absolute no go
That was great... Nor-folking way... Hey, at least it wasn't a pound of fries (chips, as you call them)...
They didn’t sleep with the bed warmer. It was filled with heated coals and would warm the bedding before you snuggled in for the night.
BBQ sauce is too sweet, and is an appetite blocker pepper corn, gravy, or a bit of mustard to help the tedium of just beef should be better.
Rump steak.  LOL.  Hope your jaw muscles are up to it.
Best steak scene is from the Great Outdoors. Good ol 96er
Algorithmus 😊
with words like "vociferously" and "occlude", your masters in english is showing, my friend!
What type of steak is that?
Hey Adam. From Detroit Michigan
No forking chance 😭🤣
Awesome win,Beard! I collect autographed photos of really cool 😎 celebrities. How can I get one of “The Beard”?
Fifty bucks is a bargin.
Watching John Candy forced to eat the fat and gristle and then wrestle the giant grizzly after - comes to mind. LOL
I love being a beardling
Wow!! That was a challenge! I’m so glad you completed it. Good work!
Just came back to this video because this pub is sadly closed recently and I hadn't realised you did this challenge.
Even after a hundred beard vids i thought this is unbeatable 😂
No one knew that the knitters were actually dangerous assians
Hooray for the THUGSUN!!
The challenge is not completed, excuses for religion should not work.
They should have given you a sharper knife.
"I like babies but I couldn't eat a whole one."
Try Indian food .... maharaja thali
Fire! Fire! The fair's on fire!
Smallest steak seen in a Brazilian Steakhouse
I am 5mins in the video and I have to stop watching and move on because I am starving and I have no way of getting any food.  Hard to be poor.
Could you do a side profile pic of yourself before and after a challenge. I want to see if your belly is visibly distended from the intake of food or if as I suspect is the case no discernible difference, meaning that you do indeed have hollow legs.
Norfolkin' Way Challenge is definitely the right name for it, haha!!
I would the hot fat only with the fries
Should ask for a pair of scissors makes it easier
So technically 98oz? Not 100oz if the fat isn’t eaten. Cause it weighed with it.
You wasted the best part of that steak is the fat
Damn they at least could have given you a steak knife.  Good lord what kinda pub serves a 100oz steak with a butter knife?  You aren’t serving him filet mignon that’s been marinating for a day and perfectly tender
Reminds me of that scene in the John Candy movie The Great Outdoors...."There's nothing left there but gristle and fat!" *cook stares expectantly*
Am I the only one who eats meals while watching this? I feel like I’m faster 😂😂😂
Wow I'm in shock.  I don't know where you put it all, but holy-o-fuck can you put it away.  Love your videos
Does it in less time than for 2 people and still slams a pud in, different beast 😂
Beard needs to hire a steak cutter, surely he can spring for it
Your videos are the perfect diet regimen for me. I'm hungry when I start the video and by the end my hunger has been satisfied.  😅
God bless my guy. You can eat that steak but not eat three pancakes.
the face when he said anal 😂😂😂
"Greetings, beardlings."  *Likes video*
they could have at least had given you a proper steak knife to cut into that meat; that knife you had is barely better than a butter knife.
No its 45min for a couple and 60min solo get it right son lol
😂😂😂 love the 'Hello Beardlings' I feel like a gremling shouldn't be fed after midnight 😅😂
That rind looks delicious 😍
Why isn't this the 2.83kg steak challenge?  I didn't realize you use the avoirdupois system in England.....
Wonderful staff. Well done.
Norfolk-ing way challenge 🤣😂
Chewing that steak must be harder than the volume of food.
Finished in less time than the only 4 TEAMS that completed the challenge... that's nucking futs!!!
draw the line at babies... 😅 are we safe chat???? chat... oh no to silent 😮 runnnnn
I'm defo eating that fat.
Do you eat the sides separately as part of a strategy or just personal preference?
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
2:13 ... that's what she said... I wish I could travel across the ocean to try this challenge! That steak looks delicious!
Please also provide a description of the weight of food in the metric system, not in football feets per square-stone ;)) Thanks for another great vid Adam!
Cream on cake! Wtf! I’ve eaten tres leches cake but never dawned on me to add my self. And now my fat buns is thinking add condensed milk. 🤤 It’s so simple and right in front of my gob the whole time.
Fats and gristle is the best part! Jus got to eat it hot loses its charm when it starts to congeal haha
One problem with these ,you kill the challenges 😮
EEESHHHTUUULAAAHHHUU
what a terrible knife they gave you
So if the timer doesn't start till you cut the steak.. Then technically you could eat all the sides before the timer starts lol
Det är så coolt jag älskar det❤❤❤❤
Comparing the Size of the Meat to the Baby is so Manly thing we bois do all the Time. ✅️ 😊
You should get one of those electric turkey carver things.
Why is bro not taking out the napkins from the plate ?? 😭😭
I think the butter knife was a jip. You needed a sharp steak knife for that hunk of delicious looking meat.
did they give you a butter knife as a joke for that steak? that's so mean lol good job smashing it beard
This guy is sick
Congratulations on another win! That was a beast of a steak! The fat did look mighty good too haha
i thought the man said if you do it in a pair you get 45 minutes but if you do it solo you get 60 minutes...?
The fat's the best part of a steak. Guess you're interested in winning, though. Well played. I'd have wasted the extra room eating the fat first.
Healing bottoms suppositories will be needed after this!
F@^*king Gross why not fully cooked Damm the fat is still raw and the meat as well raw the next challenge u due on stake get it fully raw meat nextime.. I hope u get a tapeworm on your next meat challenge.
The bed warmer behind you would not generally have been left in the bed while you slept, they were used to warm the bed before getting in it. The long handle allowing you to move the warmer from bed head to foot without graspinh the hot metal.  I had the... opportunity to use one once and, they're very effective actually but, id imagine over time, with wear and tear they could start to pose a fire risk!
You barely complained about the mushrooms!
He said they start the timer when you cut into your steak so the strategy is to eat all the sides before you cut into the steak
I don't get the eating one at a time thing. It would more enjoyable for me to break up the flavor as I went
Easy I’m smaller than Adam is and I could do that I’ll literally inhale that shit😂
I'm surprised they served the steak with the large piece of fat, they should have rendered it into talo such a waste of beautiful talo..
I would eat the sides with the meat..
Man!, Your videos are really fun, Absolute Beast!!
Did they only give him a butter knife to cut up that steak? Lol
I can feel the meat sweats from here…….
you sir are in another level
I think I would eat the things I hate 1st so I could enjoy the rest without having to think about eating mushrooms last. Yuk! I would probably have eaten the mushrooms before I even plowed into the steak.
I have GOT to visit this place! That steak looks phenomenal and those chips look perfect!
I felt full just watching this video lol
Why wouldn't the restaurant cut the fat off of the steak before serving it to you? Seems a bit unprofessional, doesn't it?
Thought hour for one 45 for 2?
Habibi that doesn't look like a steak knife 😅
Have steak knives not made their way to England yet? 🤔
100oz steak and no steak knife? what a forearm workout
Smashed the challenge as always Adam! And always such great interaction with everyone in my he video! Top top bloke!🌟
YOU ARE F.... GREAT MAN  :D  FREAK FROM SLOVENIA
Beard brother you're a hero nice
Omg the bits of fat are the best thing on a steak 🤤🤤
The fat is one of the tastiest part of the steak
The one challenge you'd expect Beard to grab the steak in his hands and eat it...😂
i swear he probably has the biggest turd in the world
Thank you.  I hate getting a steak and they don’t give you a serrated knife.
Wow. 100oz steak. This one truly is impressive
I know you don't eat of the floor, but it hit me as being disgustingly filthy
Does it bring business to the places you visit, for you to do their challenges?
That thing behind you wpuld used to warmt the bed up before going to sleep, not during.
You limey's need steak knives with teeth to saw thru that thick meat. Looked like you was using a butter knife.
How do you stay in shape??????
That looks more like a bread knife than a steak knife - no wonder it's so hard to cut which means it would be slowing you down - I have to wonder if they do that deliberately so people can't finish in the allotted time.
This guys a menace, comes into town, eats all your food and takes the ladies.
'30 min as a pair, but 45 as solo' it would need to be like 1 hour 15 min to be fair. you can only eat at half the rate of 2 people. and you only have one stomach  100 ounces. 6 and a quarter pounds. absurd amount of meat for one person in one sitting. like sumo wrestler levels of food.  they said you had 22 minutes left, that would be roughly an hour of total time. that is more reasonable
So heartwarming about that 2 old ladys asked to sit  behind him, they are so nice
The fat is the best part!!!!!
You dont HAVE to eat the wedges of fat.....but....why wouldnt you? Thats where all the flavor is....
Tasty looking piece of meat. I could eat that, but not in a timed challenge. And I love mushrooms. 😊   too bad that they don't have rice pudding. ❤
The fat is the best part.
WOW! I'M SPEECHLESS....😨
now eat a banana split  desert. I would have aching jaws eat that meat.
bed warmer
It was a pleasure being part of the team that cooked this for you beard !!
The notes for this clip state that a two-person team must complete the challenge in 30 minutes.  But if you are solo, you get an additional 15 minutes, or 45 minutes total. But they gave him an hour? 🤔
Omg the end where the ladies were like come on we will teach ya how to knit 😂❤ had me almost crying!!! I feel like it's an unlikely duo but I'd watch that too beard!
If I would offer such a challange, I would weigh the 100 ounces of meat (2.8 kg), cut into individual steaks and roast all one after the other as the guest wants (rare, medium rare, etc.) so it looks more like a very dry roast beef
No it’s a brass banjo🤡. Do you have a good plumber on call?
They don’t have A1 sauce in the UK? BBQ sauce would be way too rich.
A better knife might have been nice! 😂
The knitting ladies added something to the video.
They couldn't trust you with a real steak knife ?? 😅😅😅 you used a butter knife.
Does anyone know what he does that weird intro?
They closed down shortly after ur visit lol
Awesome mate,great challenge, love the support for you,keep it up😂
I wanna try this, solo, no sauce.
I would choke to death if I did this shit
How about a steak knife
Bro is that well done...
You are bonkers as having a pudding ? Are you showing off HAHAHA
I purchase steak for my girl, but I get that the store. See her boop?? She’s too cute to not give her a steak.
Did he put heavy cream on the cake at the end??? Or is it melted whipped cream? Or frosting? I've never seen that before it looks amazing.
Looks Delicious Med Well for me please Enjoy 😋😋😋
Mr. Beard you should of askef the lafies to knit you a blanky cause you look like you were about to fall asleep at the table 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Missing you Mrs beard x
Beardlings is my new favorite word ❤
i don't know how you don't browse more to abate favor fatigue
They might give you a dull knife on purpose!
Antique banjo conversion to bed warmer 😉 😆😂
Hi! Next time ask for a chefs knife. That would make it so much easier on your poor fingers! Well done though! You are awesome!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
Great video but we can all agree the real stars are the knitting ladies. BeardKnitsFood spin off channel maybe?
🤘
I draw the line at babies, lmao
@Beardmeatsfood  you need to invest in a chef's knife to take with you to steak challenges
Unreal.. Adam solo beats the team time on the steak!
It's a third steak place I'm watching you taking challenge at. Why they always give you get wrong kind of knives? :D It's way easier to go through it with proper steak knife.
That's not a steak, that's  a freaking roast.
2:15 - i draw the line at babies - if only the lead of the lost prophets felt the same way.
I’m not sure if you have to use the fork and knife, but if not, I’d pick that whole chunk of meat up with my bare hands and cave man that shit lol. Also, kudos to you for being able to drink something carbonated while doing challenges! That would fill be up so fast on its own lol
Thats easy. 100 oz steak ? Where do i sign up? If it wasnt for the mushrooms ( gross ) this would be easily doable . Id fail due to the  mushrooms. Fun fact . I go up for 27ths of prime rib every time
Bloke must drop some gargantuan logs
The knitting club clapping was gold!
Beard makes me laugh, cool guy 😎
After all that meat, something sweet is definitely needed... although, where the hell do you put it, never mind all you ate before!!!
how could you eat that meat brick? It’s at least 4 fingers high and it cooked all the way trough That’s disgusting
Warum die Leute so freundlich zu ihm sind? Er spricht höflich mit allen Anwesenden. Egal ob Angestellte oder Publikum. Und vor allem: er nimmt sich auch die Zeit dafür! Andere schlichten nur verbissen in sich rein. Er ist ein super freundlicher Typ. Man kann ihn bei einer Challenge als Wirt nur gerne als Gast haben! Beste Reklame ever!!! 👍👏👏🙌
Overcooked.
"Can I get a pair of scissors sir?"
On to the fungus!😂😂
I love this channel. It either makes me hungry or want to vomit on and empty stomach. I only eat once a day, and sometimes this makes me realize how hungry I am
Do you train?
That’s sooo much protein
It should be criminal that he had to cut that steak without a steak knife!
After 2 months in county jail having carbs throwed at me, ill take 2 of those steaks. Seriously protein withdrawal
Vociferously. Cracking word.
I love steak but after that I would not want to eat steak for a while.
Adam, I didn’t see it in the comments, but if you ever get some downtime, check out a movie from the 1980’s starring John Candy & Dan Aykroyd called, “The Great Outdoors”. In the movie John Candy’s character agrees to take on the restaurant’s steak challenge called, “The Old 96’er” which was a 96 oz. Steak with all the fixin’s.    SPOILER ALERT :  Candy’s character beats the challenge, but not before the meat sweats had totally set in, and just when he thought he was done, the “Chef” comes to the table to angrily bark, “You ain’t done yet” John Candy pushes back, “There’s nothing left on this plate but fat & gristle!”  The “Chef” leans closer & intensifies his scowl!!  Check it out some time!  Cheers!!
You gotta watch The Great Outdoors with John Candy. The part about the grissle and fat is so funny.
The big rind of fat is the best part!!! Just needs some horseradish sauce...
Ask for a steak knife next time! ❤
Dude you need a battery operated filet knife!
I know this is a challenge but I think the food should look a little appetising at least. Steak looks dry and eugh...
My god!  Do you clog the toilet afterwards? 😂
Steak....... boring?  Take it back.
I honestly don't have a clue how you do it man! Cheers!
Needs to be BEAST meets food !
I would suffer with trigger finger and it really hurts releasing them
"You're like a baby. I'm bigger then you . GET IN MY BELLY!"
Beard out there living life to the fullest for all of us
2:13 Thank you
😃👍🏻
Adam, I've always wondered why you eat one thing at a time. Most people like to balance flavors (and it would help prevent your so-called flavor fatigue) by mixing things up while eating. Can you please comment on this in a future video sometime?  Also, I'd love it if you did some food challenges here in Japan sometime. :D I'll help you find places if you need.
I enjoy watching for sure but evetime I watch I feel like its wrong. what your doing for a dozen different reason's.
Definitely needed a better knife than that 😅 but it was criminal using BBQ sauce on steak?! Only A1 Steak sauce!
Lmao, cutting all the steak with what looks like a butter knife🤣 They should have at least gave a steak knife or a chainsaw😂😅
Hi Adam! Love watching your videos while I eat, lol.  That bedwarmer in the corner was only swished around between the sheets to take the chill off. You wouldn't have to keep it in bed. I prefer a big dog for all night warmth. 😂
Cool videos. Never eat a bite of cake like that again, ok? 😅
The fat or gristle I would eat that too. I love that stuff.
I have a weakness for genuinely friendly restaurant staff
Holy shite and fook....how the hell, did you do that..??????.brother that's insane 😳...massive respect 🙏
Great job Beard. Congratulations on your win.
the steak looks so dry....
it looks way overcooked
well done
Love his videos, but I feel like I’m his Proctologist as I always have his bowel movement schedule down with every video! 😂😂😂😂😂
Maybe, after your eating days are done, a second career in knitting competitions😂
I was watching that episode with Randy and Beard doing a pizza challenge together and Beard was mocking Randy for "sex noises". Beard, what are those expressions and noises you make when you eat dessert. Close up and always at the climax too lol
I love ther fat...
Adam you my friend are “DaBomb”💣💣💣💣💣💣💣👍🏻👍🏻
I wonder if he smokes a joint before he eats. So he has the munches, lol.
Why don’t the knucklehead restaurant owners give you a proper steak knife so you don’t have to keep sawing away at it?
That steak challenge looks like a dream to me
Is that a butter knife?
😅😅😅😅😅
I got the meat sweats just staring at it
Man your shits must be pretty gross!
Guess he really does have a dessert stomach lol
At what point do you become a professional?
A bib for your beard would probably be a time saver. When it comes to these challenges. Less beard wiping more eating !🤡
You look jacked, but not 'big', how the heck do you get all that food in!?
Looks so overcooked 😢
It’s a banjo not a bed warmer 😂
Yeah that totally makes sense. 45 minutes for a team of 2 and 60 for solo 🤨
Hey Man, do You make T shirts/Merch? I want to buy some merch(I FOUND THE MERCH!!!!) Go to his channel and swipe over to the store guys! And props to you on this challenge man.
How the hec 😅
Guy: "We're not anal"  Beard: 🤨
You just stretched your stomach.  What is so great about that?
"I'm from a line of babies."!!
Easy for 2 people well I mean you eat the steak I'm pretty sure I could have polished off them sides 🙂
No, no please Beard, be relentlessly descriptive. We need to be able, more and more, to put ourselves in your shoes oh dear leader 😂 Well done 🔥👏
the fat is the best part
2.8kg of steak, wow. Thats a roast!
I'm confident I could take this one, maybe o.O outside looks kinda juicy, but the inside looks super dry and very well done. I couldn't eat it all like that. Gimme rare or medium rare
this is how you host a food challenge!
I wouldn't try that of course but I can't pass on the fat.😁
I hate this man when I'm hungry.
I really love babies but I can't eat a whole one.
A good wool fabric is hard to find that’s not 150$ a yard.
BBQ sauce? Get some HP or Daddies 😂
They have these cool tools called steak knives..
rip to your taste buds.. i know that steak was not made how it needed to be lmao
That's nearly 3kgs of meat!! You're a human grizzly bear.
Between you, me, and the fencepost, I would’ve just picked it up by hand and bit straight off it. Absolute caveman from the start.
Watched i dont know how many of these videos and i just ask myself now... "How?"
I can't believe they gave you such a big steak, and not even a steak knife
How, I mean simply where does it go? My Dad said I had hollow legs... Is it possible to have "hollow body"? RESPECT!
Using sauce to fight flavour fatigute makes sense, but then going on and dipping everything including the salad in the BBQ sauce seems to defeat the purpose tbh.
How did Beard work out it was 3 pounds of steak??
Shoulda given homeboy a proper steak knife and cooked it rare.
What the heck happened to the explanations of how much time you get in this video, it was different every 5 minutes
1 year on and still no beard meats knitting? Shocking. Great video once again dude.
Those Ladies could have Knitted a bib out of your Beard.
Bro he said you had 60 min solo 45 dou lol Anyways I have a cousin close to your size and he always blew my mind with how much he could eat but you sir are bloody insane lol I thought I was a camp bc I can eat an entire family box of cereal or an entire large pizza but thoee are even on rare occasions lol
They gave him a butter knife to eat it with lol?
very impressive, i wonder how much he shits.
This is the first time I've seen you use cutlery. It's usually caveman style shovelling it in by hand. I've only been a subscriber fir a few months, so I'm catching up with your back videos. I'm watching this in April 2024. Xxx
That bite of cake looked painful
that steak would have been beautiful if it was cooked rare
Adam must starve himself for a few days before these challenges to be able to consume such large amounts
I used to always eat the juicy fat of the steak but I’d have to draw the line on this steak and that huge slab of fat
Lol you said 3 different times and none of them were right. The guy said 35 minutes for a pair, 1 hour for a single person.
I always eat while I watch these videos right now I'm having chicken cutlet parmesan with baked penne garlic bread in a triple cherry cheesecake for dessert will the giant chocolate shake
Who doesn’t love a good steak and Granny’s
Is there a challenge in Westchestersonfield?? 😂
👍
Each of your videos causes me to worry about your spinchter.👍
The Great Outdoors.
Come on beard if I can make a Big Texan Steak challenge video so can you!!! 🥩 ❤️ 🧔🏻‍♂️
I wish I knew what part of the cow this was. I don't know how you even get a cut that big.
I hate the way he ate that cake 😫
Need to do a doubles challenge with sister beard so she has a win.
Do you actually eat the whole dessert or just take a bite of it for the videos?
You have a dessert menu? 😂😂 seriously dude, after a 100oz steak and the fixins 🤘🤘 mad props to you mate. I know it's been a year since you've done this one. But holy crap. That is an insane time to finish that meal. I love my steak, but i hate fungus 😂 no way would i even try that with having to eat mushrooms too 😂😂
I would've called it the Flintstones steak challenge tbh but that's just me
Protein poisoning is an actual risk.
Fair Play mate TOP MAN.
Sorry for being a dick, but that grey thing on your plate claiming to be a steak looked dreadful. Have they cooked it overnight?! And why are you using a butter knife to cut it up? British people should stick to roast beef as virtually nobody knows how to properly cook steak... I'm British by the way.
The meats sweats must be brutal on this challenge
If I ever open a restaurant / eatery place,  and decide to do a food challenge, you'll be first one to be banned lol 😂😂
Why didn't they give ya a steak knife?!?! It looks like you're using a freakin butter knife
Love you encouraging yourself in the narration😅❤
After that a dessert ? XD hahaha i love ur videos
You are a beast!
The fat is the best bit and a lubricant 😋😋
Why the wanky knife! Good steak knife required!
Need to bring your own knife to challenges
This is a cracking pub!
The fat is the best part lol
Was that a steak knife Adam? Care to settle a bet with your answer? Great job! Thank you!
Ah a bit of extra effort and yoi could have done it in the time allowed for a pair!
That steak is overcooked and looks very dry, distasteful, and chewy, to be honest.
I always wonder how you never seem to gain weight you really are amazing!
Beard has a cast iron stomach.
Lmao....one onion ring to finish it all....💍
Thats all i hate about a steak. Hard to eat meat, made harder to eat. Respect to your jawmuscles.
That's just freaking mind-blowing. Wow
Some YouTube stars are actually just normal people. ❤Beard…..
Bed warmer. You don't sleep with it. They would run it between the sheets to warm them up before getting into bed.
That knive should be illegal to eat meat
I was hearing without seen this as I showered, the intro made me laugh uncontrollably because I heard wank hard as the name of the place. Had to stop showering, get towel and listen properly before I could continue with my life.
Just wolfing that steak down!@😂
“The Old 96’er”
I wanted the fat...
John Candy had to eat the fat and gristle off the ol 96er!   Nice job. That looked hard.
The fact they have a doggie menu tells you thats a cool place. It's like when you go to a dessert joint and they'll give you a pup cup.
I couldnt even cut all that steak with a steak knife, let alone eat it lol.
At least there aren't a ton of chips with it.
2:03 "baby, the other other white meat" - Fat Bastard(Austin Powers)
It was so hard to watch you cut that huge steak with a little butter knife!! I give you so much props bro. You are the man!!
oh wow thats my idea of a steak .... AND would eat the fat too!!
Think his beard is fake and got a bag hidden inside that he slight of hands alot of the food
I can’t imagine what it was like to give birth to that meal the following day. Kudos boss!!
I've never seen Beard use a fork so much in one challenge!
"Time starts when you cut into your steak." Sides first, then, and bare hands!
The look to the camera after the anal comment😂😂 Quality👌
Don't have to be posh to feed your dog steak
11:29 why do you need to open your mouth that wide?
4:03 you messed the times up. Pairs get 45 and single gets an hour lol. Your a beast at these challenges
I like how they gavw you a butter knife to cut it!! A little mental warfare on their side!!
Got the commentary wrong lol. 45mins as a pair and 1 hour as a solo
You're sweating and getting hot cuz you're wearing a hat !
Too bad you never went to Fawlty Towers in Torquay in Devon. Basil would of kicked you out. It would've been funny to interact with him and Manuel!
Wow.
White Heart - i wonder if that's a reference to the white fat surrounding your heart after that steak? 😂 Dude you're a beast. How someone your size, can eat that much, time and time again, is beyond me. Bravo!
Around 8min.yah mentioned that bed warmer,it only gets slid into the layers of blankets an moved back an forth warming the layers then is withdrawn before you climb into the bed(use to read alot of medieval stories back in the 60's, an the maid was always wrote about preparing the knights or kings bed before he'd go to sleep)
Noo, you left the best bit on the plate....😱😱😱
Beardlings 😂😂😂
Tha must have hollow legs thee mate 😅😂😅😂 respect
Obviously fake
Love the knitting ladies ❤
I bet your subscriber base is mostly vegans. 😂
As a pair you get 45 minutes, solo you get 60 mins.
I think you're meant to take the warming pan out of the bed before you get in it!😄
You ate the equivalent of a sustainable-weight baby. Legend!
patient. wow 11:56
like I said. mr infinite
😊😊😊😊😊
love comfy shoes
fun.thats all  we need😊nice b man
cool shoes. cooler dude
I am baffled. People let him leave beef fat behind but he is forced to eat potatoes and onion rings fried in vegetable oil, sometimes literally kilos of it.  Ruminant fat is not only much healthier, but it's also much tastier. Am I the weird one?
used to love having that bit of fat on a roast because it would have rendered down into the meat, on a steak, maybe not, but I'd definitely eat some of it with the meat
We had a place that had a 120oz steak and it was only $60! Sadly they closed down and a healthy food place went there and closed after a month 😂
50% of the people apparently only means 150% of the time for 2 people weird
They would put it under the bed so the heat rise up and warm the whole bed
it looks so overcooked :O anyone agree? :O
Still love adams glazed over look when he finishes off his celebratory dessert 😂
The gristle looked delicious I reckon I would have eaten that 😋😋
You need one of those electric carving knives 😂 Another fun watch! Nice one, mate.
Did you ask for it to be overcooked instead of medium rare?
2:08 “I draw the line at babies” probably made those ladies low key uncomfortable
Might as well have given you a spoon to cut that thing with...
This is just Show eating for Youtube,if you have speed eating that you do in good old days you will don it possibly under 15 Min, possibly under 10 min but i know you are getting old ;)
oh no its well done
Hats off to you chap, I recently tried the Green King Steak Fondue challenge, I'm not a competitive eater though I'm just fat and love my food but Christ it took some chewing to get through just 24oz and a melted camembert, how you managed 100oz is beyond me!
The bed warmer is only used to warm the bed then it's removed for the night.
Yes, that looks like a need warmer
You need a kitchen knife for that thing.
Beardy polished it off in record time . I think he could eat a whole cow if that was the challenge? And still eat a dessert.
I’ve been on a diet for three months and have been living vicariously through your videos.
Is that a butter knife😅
Looks like they gave you a butter knife!!!
Finally!!!! A collaboration 😂❤
fat makes me feel so sick especially when its in my mouth
By now i thought the beard would have his own very sharp knife
I'd lose it all at the mushrooms. Vile things.
He cut that steak w/ a butter knife. That is a tender steak.
Ancient popcorn maker
Good Lawd!
100 oz steak for 2??? Two what lions?
"people say I never do collabs" lol
I love how the tray was flexing when she carried it out!! Plus, didn't they have a steak knife??
meats food , do u under stand meat is food, so ur saaying food food , no  wander ur getting a devorce  ,
That steak is over cooked.
What a waste... overdone
watching you use dull knives hurts me. bring your own razor sharp knife for steak challenges
He said you get 60 minutes to complete it solo!
I can only imagine passing all this afterwards. Ouch.
Flip flops in the dining room.really. desgaciado .And why the misspelling.
You should start bringing an electric knife with you on steak challenges :D
good vibes
Looked like you about to past out after chocolate cake! mate... Nice job beast!!
📸
The fats, the best part !!! You should have asked for it to be medium rare (less cutting)
beautiful resturant lovely staff can't wait to visit food looks fantastic  but i wont try that challenge I am a lite weight  softie🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank goodness there wasn't a ton of Fries!!!! 🤣😂 New subscriber for about a month. Love all your videos so far!! Very entertaining and fun.
Wow 😲
Looks like they meed to purchase some proper beef cutlery and not give you a regular knife
Now here is an actual realistic meat 2 chips ratio worth talking about
Not eating the fat is cheating. It's as much a part of the steak as any other fat you may have consumed.
Love how you chat it up with the ladies at the end. Super sweet of you 😊
They needed to give you a sharper knife 😊
All that's gotta come out 😜🤣
The least they could do is give you a real steak knife! That thing looks plastic.
Amazing brother, crazy amount of meat! I’d love to do a challenge with you!
The ladies at the end, offering to teach you how to knit! So heartwarming❤️
what do you yell out before u start each time? can't make it out
Bro was a T rex in a previous life
NOT EATING THE FAT.......
Love this guy
It really looks a dry piece of boiled meat.
next steak challenge, ask for a chefs knife or something extra sharp
All i can see is john candy in the great outdoors 😂
why did he cook it well done ? lol  so dry
Idk, I love steak so maybe its just me being weird but I don't like the challenges like this. It just feels so wasteful
It's no wonder your hands hurt after a bit using a dull butter knife to cut a steak instead of a steak knife
I'd have eaten that fat 🤤 . I know, Adam might not desire it, with all the meat he's eaten, but it'd go great with the shrooms.
The fat is the best bit most tasty to
11:29
I simply do not understand how there is even physical room in your body to fit all that. It is mind blowing to see how much foot you can fit lmfao.
These videos are magnificent. I love the energy level and humility and light heartedness of it all.
Reminds me of the great Outdoors scene with the late great John Candy, fortunately Beardy did not have to eat the fat, and did not have a demonic chef and an annoying friend to deal with either.
🐂😳
Did u use a butter knife lol
I love when you match good vibes in a friendly establishment! Nothing is worse than a stingy mgt that won't celebrate your genuine good humor and honest win!
Why, JUST WHY!!!
You should bring your knife next or every time 😊you
you get 45 min as a team and 60min solo. not the 30 and 45min you have said in description. They said only 3 time has it been completed vs the 4 you have written in the description. I assume with that information being incorrect that the information about your health is also incorrect. :~P
The face while eating the cake hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂 love your videos so much u have a amazing sense of humor
Whats the up beat trumpet music in the beginning
I love the reasonable size of the sides. Nothing worse then the massive added chips
The day after protein shit is gonna be insane! :D
Just watching this makes me want to poop lol.
I thought texas did everything bigger?
if i dont have a beard but i still enjoy your videos ....do i still count as a fan?
Can you just buy me that meal, I’ll try it and throw it up.
Was the butter knife a tactical error?
Bed warmer
Food looked awful…
this guy is stupid doing this to his body
A steak knife might have done better than butter knife.. also, you get 1 hour as solo and 45 minutes as a duo
Not eating the fat? Shame
I can't be the only one who figures that he pays his price the next day in the bathroom. 😩
Ooooh carpel tunnel.  I know how it feels, that shit sux!
Has this guy ever failed a challenge?
😂 it includes some kind of foliage that was brilliant Mr beard I'm sure that the chef was happy about you describing his veg as bush brilliant effort as usual and thanks from 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Without the strip of fat, it's probably equivalent to the Old 96er.
I would eat the fat! It's the second best part, after the meat.
is Rocket the same as Arugula in the states? i always get confused lol
Is using a butter knife to cut the whole thing part of the challenge ?
Only thing went through my mind while watching this video. How much flossing did Beardy do afterwards?! 😂
the fat is the best part of the steak....
I think you make it up about being full. You just dnt want to show the rest of the world up😂😂😂
You should start bringing your own steak knife to these challenges
you took the bed warmer out before you got in lol
they could have given you a proper steak knife not that blunt old thing
That's 6lbs of steak. My God!
nAice
Wouldn't have thought that you would have room for dessert after 100oz stake
Good show can't believe you guys can get that down especially in the time limits you are given... You mentioned a lot of your competition but I never hear you mentioned furious Pete...or stoney...come to Canada and try ... MT bellies
So others dont have to google it: 100 ounces = about 2.83 kilograms.
Ask for a suitable steak knife or bring your own if they allow.  Also, cutting it across the grain will make it much easier to chew :)
No steak knife?????
BEARDLINGS 😭🤣
How do you stay in shape mate. You obviously have hollow legs
I will eat all these before going to gym again 😂
Surprised you had room for desert after this one waw 😂
I feel more and more like a pervert to like to watch.... It's so confusing. You have your eating challenge war cry which sounds like '....ischk skürrrrrdht...."..... And I have the picture of a Viking in front of my eyes who fought with his sword to protect his wife... And nowadays you're a hero because you eat very much....just for your wife being able to keep the money for buying enough food for her to survive life.... It's strange, but very funny. I'm sorry for my Palaver. Thanks a lot for your videos. They often make my day 🙏
there is zero health inspectors in England. Dogs and open toes. Surprised it's not packed.
Mushrooms don't have much flavor and imho you should eat them early on to get them out of the way. 🤣🤣Great job.
What a Beast!!!
Who else gets super hungry watching these? 😂
That fat looked like the best thing on the plate.
Steak of that size they really should give you decent steak knife at least :D
Скажи мне друг, как долго ты какаешь после этого? 😅
Whats with the uk and every steak being well done...
Talking about the salad....the next day must have been like passing a Trident submarine. I wouldn't be surprised if you destroyed your plumbing!!!
Seems like beard needs to bring his own custom cutlery that doesn’t hurt his hands.
I just couldn’t digest that I’d land in the hospital with a Milk of Magnesia drip.
I have seen some of your challenges. what I noticed that it becomes a struggle cutting the steaks. How bout you bring your own knife to the table?
100oz's. Jesus!!! Got it down pretty well as usual. Great vid and challenge!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Great 👍
I'd like to see how much steak you could eat if we got someone to cut it up for you champ!!?? (If that hasn't probably already been said) Hitting your channel hard pal loving it🙂👍👍👍
Bro you insane in good way
The fat's the best bit!
@timthetatman
You neeed a better steak knife
tried to find in the endlesss comments … my question : do we kn ow what was the piece of meat
I don’t eat steak anymore but I’ve had one when I was younger and the fat part helped with the dense chewy bits of steak lol.
Damn dude! You need an epsom salts chaser after that.
The bed warmer was put between the comforter n top sheet and the bottom sheet then run up and down the bed to warm it then repeated over n over to warm the bed then removed when your warm body crawled in.  They work.
Looks like they cooked the sh!t out of it, is it easier to eat well done or medium rare?
on normal days (_!_) after challenge days (_O_)
good man i would eat the beef first i lost and had to pay for it on the other hand i eat everything in what i feel first.i dont mix.i pick one item and eat it all and move to next item sometimes though liking vegetables will eat them first but wanting to dig into meat first,i guess i know i like both but the vegetable is fast and easy craving to eliminate for me to focus on the gold,the other sides be it onion rings,whatever are ok but best left to last
im sure that he must flush his bowels before said challenges using a pre surgery solution to empty bowels,if not his last meal would be touching cloth regardless if he thought he emptied his bowels
raw doggin the tomato is so freaky to me hahawoulda made a few lil sandys with the onion rings nd veg!
Is there a reason why you don’t mix it up as you go along? Like hands sore or sick of the steak, so you have a few chips or a tomato and then back at it? Just wondering is there a method. I’m sure you’ve answered this before. New follower. Great content mate. You’re a beast.
hey!!! near me!! i might try it!!
Your arms might not have been so tired if they gave you a steak knife to cut it with, not a butter knife.
I would love to eat the fat piece.
They're not chips they're called french fries
@beardmeatsfood Do pubs intensionally give you dull knive(s) as part of the challenge? Seems they could provide a proper sharp steak knife. Love the Vids!!!!
His beef would be easier to eat if it wasn’t over cooked. Rare steak tastes better and is easier to chew and swallow.
He needs a miniature version of an electric carving knife. The cutting of the steak seemed to slow him down the most…albeit did give him some time to chew between bites.
thought you might crack.....
Are we seeing the prelude to beardknitsthings
We not gonna talk about how they only gave him a butter knife to cut through a 100oz steak lol
coming in as 100 %human , coming out as 97% human and 3% beef 😂
Has he ever lost? The Man, the Myth the Legend!
That man that was running the place was friggin amazing. What a “good chap” as you called him. Couldn’t have said it better myself, the American 😅
Not going to lie the fat on the edge is always my favorite part of a steak
“I draw the line at babies” even for a really cool t-shirt?😜
I think it's easier if you eat the fat with the rest of the meat. And tastier. That's how we eat steak in Greece. But you do you
Am I the only one who likes to eat the fat on steaks? I have always enjoyed it
Rocko Lexington Washington USA 🇺🇸
Fat is the best I rather eat the fat
looking at how that place looks like and owners reaction = it is closed or very successful :D
Respect for them not making him eat the lumps of fat
ehm. he said 45min for the pair, 60 min for solo xD
I love how friendly and supportive most of the folks are, in your videos. It's heartening to know most folks are going to cheer on this goofiness cause they see it's all in good fun.
Did they give you a butter knife to cut that beast?
How does approx 7 lbs fit in his stomach? I'm a physician and it amazes me every time I see one of his videos. I would love to see results of his blood work after one of his trips. It's mind-blowing what the human body can endure.
Bruh, idve asked for a much better knife. .
This man has the look of a Viking and he eats like a Viking
100 oz steak seems to qualify as a roast.
Thats more like a roast than a 🥩 steak
OMG - that’s nearly 3 kilos of meat!! I had a steak Wellington once 40 years ago and was sick to my stomach all night. Haven’t eaten red meat since 😅
The first one I've seen where the sides were just absolutely ridiculous amounts. Lol
I don't know why they don't supply bigger knives. The challenge should not be cutting up.
Those wedges of fat are perfectly edible and good for you! Balances out the fat protein ratio 💪
Nooooo.... the fat is the best bit
18 3/4  lb,s steak
Congratulations  Beard
Adam you should really invest in your own high quality utensils.  I watched a few of these videos where it looked like you had to use some fairly blunt steak knives.   Imagine a nice tempered steel steak knife that you can sharpen before each challenge.  I may be jaded as well and have often wondered if maybe they intentionally give you a crappy knife to slow you down.    Food for thought.
Hey ! beard man, real nice channel mate, just so you know, you make me think of my daughter when there's mushroom.. 🍄 🤣🍄
Now i need a steak.
you got to ask for a cheffs knife lol!
Thats a butterknife. Lol. No wonder your having a hard time. You should start taking your own steak knife.
I thought he said for 2 people it is 45mins and solo 1 hour.   A bedpan warmer, yeah it is. I never needed one 😅😅😅😅. BRILLIANT 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌💕💕💕💕💕
You should have eat the fat in the car doing 55 mph driving with one hand
Could have given you an actual steak knife 🤐😂
Reminds me of that Austin Powers scene, when Fat Bastard wants to eat Mini-Me.
watched my first video about 4 days ago and now i cant stop,,,,you are like a wolf,,,a golden god...  unbelievable my man
You Need a trim around the mouth there bud.
does heever pay for thefood haha
John Candy couldn't keep the 96ozer down, but he had to eat the fat and the grizzle too.
Another brilliant video Adam.  🤗
Interesting style beverage glass. I need some.
seriously dude, you must be shittin some serious logs after these challenges...
After the meat those tomatoes look so good lol
I wonder what cut of meat that was?
How about a steak knife for 100oz steaks? 😂
I live in SW America. I think you might get shot if you might get shot.😂 No wonder you needed sauce😂
Fear the beard!!! Literally ate for 2 there 😮😮  dude im still amazed by your resilience!
I always enjoy watching these videos whilst I'm eating, mostly because otherwise it msy make me hungry 😂 Only problem being, when I sit there with my meal and think "oh... im starting to struggle now!" But my plate was nowhere near as full as Adams to start with!
If not a challenge, the fat would be eaten first by me. But, you know where the flavor is
The rind of fat is the best part! Did he say three pounds? 100 oz is more like six pounds.
That’s nice. Lol
looked like you had a butter knife trying to cut that
just found your channel 3 days ago, and find myself binge watching your videos day to day, always getting hungry. Its amazing how these amounts fit inside you. Its like you are full stomach inside.
is this man still alive
Keep the Money, get tha Baby in my Belly… LOL
It was called a bed warmer than used it to warm up the bed before bed time to keep from getting under cold covers
Could at least have given you a steak knife!
Any rules against bringing an insanely sharp personal steak knife?
I hope you took that lovely lady up on her opportunity to teach you how to knit. She seemed excited at the prospect
Bro I'd eat that fat first easily
Dying to know what the meal would cost?  Beard doesen't care, he so very rarely has to pay. Four normal hungry guys would struggle with this (though we would want extra chips). Great advertising for the White Hart and I agree with some of the comments, that cake portion was a little, well, little.
I can't believe he didn't get a streak knife. Cutting through that beast with a butter knife must have been gruelling.
All I can picture is John candy in the great outdoors.  Lol
Adam👋👋👋  In fairness they should  allow you to cut up the  steak first before starting  the timer…  Shalom✌️and Agape 💕
This looked easy ❤
“I draw the line at babies” 😂😂 you’re so funny
Can I say that my favorite parte of a steak is the werge of fat?😂
I'd like to see how they cook that roast beast.
Bit of advice mate ! Bring a proper knife with you , cutting it seems to be your only problem
NORFOLK'N CHANCE!
Beeing a vegan is a big mist steak
sad they couldnt even offer you a steak knife...wtf
That was definitely a hard challenge mate
Only just discovered you a few days ago but can't believe you were in my town! Well done! I didn't even know the White Hart had a steak challenge
haim hu amar huchpa?!
You are incredible Mr Beaard, well done, How do you do it ?????🤔
Am I the only one to claping from home after the plate is finished
When’s he gonna weigh himself before and after? If he eats 3kg then let’s see it on a scale.
Beardlings. Needs more usage
Cake, nice touch. 😊😊
Steak fat cooked right is possibly the best bit of a steak. It adds flavour and I enjoy it very much. A challenge to eat all on the plate should include everything lol
The fat is the good part. Why do people always think that it's bad
What does Adam shout before he starts his food challenges - I can’t make out what he’s saying? ❤ the videos
as i admire u but don't play with your health by taking these things as food. health is wealth.
That steak looked nasty, I can’t lie. Just discovered your channel and I’m loving it. Cheers.
The fat is the best part of the steak!!
I’m watching this because unless it’s really slow cooked and super tender I can’t eat steak  I’m a bit envious
How?? That's incredible
Epic !
That pook of pure satisfaction
The episode that "BeardMeatsFood" turned into "BeardKnitsWool"
A sharper steak knife would probably have helped 😅
Me and my wife would wanna see , Houston TX Peruvian Spiced Chicken Challenge. 🙏🤘
Need a better knife.
The cake with the cream looks so damn good. I wish it were a common thing here in the states.
He almost ate that baby
i wish see him and Randy are team in a food challenge!!!
From Texas....Love ya bro!!
That steak is 6 lbs 4 oz. They should've had you eat the fat too.
I thought the fat was a sub roll
There is always room for desert eh 🍹🍮
Everything about that restaurant reminds me of the 70s, even the way the did up the food lol just looks bland, everything just bland lol but comfortable inna way lol
That's got to be the wimpiest looking steak knife I've ever seen, what is that a butter knife!?
why dont youbring an electric knife if youknow yourgoing to do these challenges
Inside this huge beard you have a face like Chris Evans
really hardcore challenge ,  he ate almost 2.8 kg of steak  all of the sides and also desert :)
The food looks delicious 😋 Mr Beard and his awesome 💯 humor and top Tier victory 🎉🎉🎉🎉Love your channel ❤ amazing 🎉🎉🎉
couldve given the man a fkn steak knife atleast...
Where do you put those things man. Your terrible dud 😂
I'm going to need to know where you got those glorious shoes.
Dang, he even asked for a cake
Is that abread n butter knife he's given🍽😅
Beard, I just wanna say thank you for all your videos and for just being you. I love your content on any average day but I find myself binging your videos when I'm having a tough time with depression and they really help brighten things up. Maybe that's weird but it does help. I've been having a real hard time lately and idk I'm just really grateful for all of these videos, your humor, your spirit and overall positive outlook. Thank you Beard, I think I can speak for all of us fans when I say we appreciate you.
Damn, down the road from me!
That’s no steak 🥩, that’s a quarter cow 🐄! 🤣😂🤣
Do you have a desert menu ? 😮
Bro using a butter knife to cut into that big ass steak is infuriating lol.
The fat is the best part of the stake.
How!?!?
dude. the fat is the best part.
Only read the description, haven't watched it yet. that rule is bullshit, only 15 minutes more for solo? it should be only 15 minutes more for two people
Which camera and lens you use?
Would've been a lot easier with an actual steak knife instead of a butter knife.
A. You should definitely learn how to knit. B. You don't sleep next to the coals.  You fill it with coals and slide it between your sheets and blankets.  It warms the bed linens and then you take it out before you get into bed.  The bed retains the heat to keep you warm...for a while.
Ever think about bringing a really sharp knife to a challenge. Maybe that's illegal across the pond.
the 72oz steak gave you a harder time than this.
'We are not anal' Thank f**k for that how gross , remind me not to book there
100oz of beef. over cooked served with a dull knife. they wish to beat you with muscular fatigue instead of over eating xD
Hot. Heart. pronounced the same.
You should have eaten the fat. This isn’t amateur hour
Yay I’m hooked  on these clips ,also love mrs beard. Down side is I get extra hungry and that’s not good if you’re trying to lose weight
need to build a small kit with a sharp knife big spoon and some beard towels lol.  giving you a butter knife for a 100 oz steak is troll as it gets.
Salute to my brother bravo
That was Epic...... eating a child for lunch!!!!!
The Fat is the best part though!!
I want that fat so bad. Looks so good.
Beard and the comment section are doing all these food challanges and here i am struggling eating 2 small drumsticks and feeling like i am about to burst😂😂
5 minutes into this video and my jaw hurts 😂
Outstanding
We ever cross paths and see you doing an eating contest I'm buying you a pitcher of your preferred beer.
I feel like i can eat 6 pounds of steak
I think you got almost everything wrong in the voice over... :)) It's 60 with 45, you say 45 with 30' for pair/ solo. 3 have been successful, you say 4. (Apologies, I'm watching this drunk at 3am, so I'm guessing that's why I had to type it down. It just seemed quite funny right now.)
7:50 it wasn't safe, lol.
Been watching you for a few weeks. How on earth do you manage it?
I wonder how high his bloodpressure is after eathing all dos meals
How is he alive after eating so much.
You must see colors, after this heavy meal 😂 🎉
Why do professional eaters concentrate on 1 thing at a time?
oink! LOL OMG I would to have had them make crispy crack lens out of the end cap fat. they fry them till they are like crispy pork Rines with a bit of salt sprinkled on. a real yum bite.  well done for sure. keep them coming cheers from Iowa USA.
How doesnt he explode from all that food is beyond me.
Also man just pick the steak up and take bites off it screw cutting it
Well I guess he's not a true fat bastard other wise he would have tried to trade the MOJO and the money just give him the baby!!!!
of ALL the many episodes i've watched, for some reason i just really like the hospitality of the staff from this one! Also, good job completing the challenge! (although i think we all knew  you would!)
lol you absolute maniac. well done
Beard is having orgasms whilst eating da cake 😂
Is that steak halal
His toilet: “Here we go again”
"people say I never do colabs" lol best colab ever!
The fat is the best part!!!
I feel like this one was actually challenging for him.
They should have given you a sharper knife.
Ive never understood why they dont include the fat in it
Ahh dream is to just eat a steak!! I havent been so far!!
Beardlings? Love yourself much lol
At least use A1 sauce don’t put bbq on a steak ffs
couldve given em a bigger knife. thats a butter knife haha
What an absolute legend…!
im telling you I love the fat on steak, crispy, juicy, salty, delicous!!
8:30 Swaffham knitting massive, big up yourself! 👊🌟
Blessed Love Family ❣️Custom Vans mate
DAMN.....that looks goood!  I'd try it just to enjoy that yummy looking steak even though I would surely fail.
This guy has a black hole for a stomach transporting all that food to a whole different dimension
At what point is it a roast and not a steak?!
I bet that knife was dull as a spatula. That and the horrendous handle makes for a terrible cutting tool, especially for heavy duty work like this 🤣
I'll go for the fat!  My fave if it's crispy. As always, was there any doubt?
Why don't you purchase a really good steak cutting knife and bring it with you. Seems a lot of challenges that you cut hurt your hand. Seems like a solution to some degree.
Use an electric carving knife
Mix some of the fat in there, it will help moisten it up and give some extra flavor.
"I wont eat you, i draw the line at babies" 😂😂 the mom probably screamed inside, awesome.
Sudocrem!
Beard beard he’s out man. He can eat it when no one else can
I miss the Hart, was fun in the 90's
Ah yes, who needs a steak knife when you have a dull butter knife? 😂
Not so messy challenge this video is
Oh Come on Nancy suck it up
Well done, watching my hives inflammation fade day after day until they completely vanished was such a relief, I went with what I pointed out and within the first 10 days or so the urticaria/angioedema was barely visible! I just go'ogled the latest by Shane Zormander and after 20 days my skin has never been healthier!
Well I am thinking if just cutting the meat makes arms hurt so much, imagine the poor stomach!
"I draw the line at babies" 😂🤣😂🤣
That's just amazing!👍
How did they give a butter knife to cut 100oz of steak
Can confirm knitting is awesome. 😂 I used to go and knit in restaurants with a local group here too before Covid
Well done, isn't it an option to switch hands with the cutlery when getting painfull fingers
Exactly which of your legs is hollow 😅🎉😅 f j b 😊
Great one! The number of steak sandwiches you can make from that one slab. Wow. 🎉
After a day of fasting this vid give me a taste of things to come tomorrow.
I Think u messed up the intro cuz u had 60 mins solo but in the intro u Said 45 😂😂😂
The heating pans were put in bed to warm it up, then taken out before getting in…I’ll stick with my electric blanket 😂 I only know about them because I taught in a very old school, built in 1907. So we did a lot of history, sometimes we would swap a class with another school for the am, pm or full day and I had to don my corset and Edwardian outfit and out came out stash of blackboards and chalk. While simultaneously ignoring the huge interactive white board, Project, laptops & pcs, electric lights etc. tho we did still have a few of the ancient light switches still left in place. We would sometimes flick that switch as someone else flicked the real switch and children thought we still had Edwardian wiring 😂 it used to have gas lamps too, a cartaker found them in the choky (cellar) my response to them being re fitted by him to use wasn’t polite! I don’t even touch sparklers! Or those miner’s lamps because it ends up with burns 😂 Slight problem I found with the choice of corseted/bison scaffolding of those days made me look like a more generous Dolly Parton …not a good look in a school! As well as an abnormal shape because my waist is out of proportion, as in small and my ribs move so I can achieve a very curvy hourglass 😂 The worst part of it was the hair! I’m not a gifted hair stylist!
I don't know why they never give you an actual sharp steak knife at these places. You should honestly just bring your own to save your hands
This is the kind of channel we would love to watch
You should have your own custom knife made for steak challenges lol
Shards of glass perhaps, but no babies. Babies are off, hahaha.. And sorry friend, but Texas will never forgive you unless you die eating another one from there 🤣🤣
someone give the man a god dam steak knife!
Lol I work in a food factory and on one of the lines we have to cut the tortilla wraps ourselves. So we roll cut and wrap one every 10 seconds and the shift is 8 hours long, our hands hurt at the end of the day and the next for a few minutes
I'm  kind of surprised  you don't bring your own weaponryown weaponry ... sharp knives , and spades or spoons and forks hahaha
Every time you eat steak you complain of your hands and arms getting tired. Need to get yourself a cordless electric knife. Slice that steak thin as tissue in about 2 minutes then you could just suck it down. Just a thought from a Canadian fan.
❤love
Just how?!!??! Where do you put it man!!! And you my have the best plumbing in the world at home!😂
all with a butter knife!!! white heart is ruthless!
I eat half a large pizza and think i'm doin good. Then watch this and  get hungry :D
100oz well done hockey puck sounds awful.
Beardlings 😂
just the sides are like a full appetizer menu lolllll
big steak and a fucking bread knife LOL
This guy is the best to his fans I love it
That doesnt seem that large maybe im a fatass but looks like an extra large portion
7:12, Isn't it racist to call people caveman who eat with hands?
calling people who eat with hands, caveman, is a bit racist don't you think? 7:12
I'm not sure I heard but how was the flavor of the steak? It looked really good.
it doesnt help that they didnt give you a  steak knife
that restaurant looked miserable
Just wow. Watched a few of your vids now and this meat...how hard it was to cut and you just finished like a man...respect for winning this challenge, but  also I would never eat there since I cannot bend and cut steel like you.
Noooooo dude!!!!! You didn’t just eat of of that!!!!!!😂 😂😂
Your face when you're eating the cake made me spit my food out laughing lmao
Let's hear it for all the vegans who just hit the floor 😂
Your the best man, i cant get over your dessert joke every time
I've watch other eating challenge YouTubers and the restaurants are often antagonistic, and you got to wonder why. But Adam is so charming and polite and all the restaurants genuinely seem to be thrilled when he wins. What a great guy.
so what Americans use as a butter knife is what they give you to cut a steak that big😵😵 no wonder your arms are tired my lordy.
Steak looks well over done and tough lol felt for you mate
Bro has a Tesla
that steak looked like it was cooked too quickly and for too long but cooking a steak of that size is very difficult and very different from a regular-sized steak. Everything else looked excellent and I would love to eat there one day!
that steak is the size of his torso mate!
Fizzy drink is a bad idea
Smashed it out the park 👌
Why would someone drink diet coke instead of normal? That chemical aspartam taste in it is disgusting
3 things i was into big as a kid, skateboarding, lego and knitting, Cheers mom
I love your videos
Bro could have beat it himself with another person and still ate him himself
Take that fat home. Chop it up for freezing, NXT time you make baked beans!
Is this man for real😮
Dude must chill in the toilet for half a day
Dude!! I love mushrooms and know you hate them. Put them with the steak and sauce and you won’t get that texture as much. You’re welcome send me money lol.
No cheesecake? Wt.... What kinda place is this.. Me and the beard love our cheesecake🍰 ❤️
is it just me...or does anyone feel bad for the animal on his plate... getting killed for entertainment eating purposes.
Give the dude a real knife lol
Love your beard. Dislike your mustache.
Have you got a dessert menu? Why? Tart? Get it now 🤦‍♂
Big Steak but they gave you the kids knife!
I would have eaten the shit out of that fat cap, it's literally the best part of the steak.
If I were ever served a steak that huge I would just pick it up and take a biiiig bite out of it just to know what it feels like
WTF😱😱 GG👍🙃
Nothing but mushrooms and chips as far as the eye can see!
100oz steak with sides....eats all of it..."Do u have desert"   WTF is that stomach capacity.
You should consider carrying along your own ultra sharp, extra long knife for these big steak challenges. It looked like that steak was at least medium, which you might have said and i missed, which would make it a tougher piece to cut. As always, awesome job.. and hey, be careful putting down our Texas steaks! The big one up in Amarillo is only 72 ounces, but still a lot of beef! You're a beast!
Why do they not give you an actual steak knife? 🔪 🥩
never trust a man with sandles n bare feet.. ugh.. disgusting f word
Gluttony at its worst
Man, I got full just looking at the video😂
Hour for only steak without fat and chips? Easy. 30 minutes would be a fair challenge steak only. Hour would be good to clean the whole plate.
You’re the GOAT!!
You need your personal knives, super sharp for these types of challenges mate!
It kind of pisses me off that they only gave you that BS butter knife thing to cut the steak. I know that UK knife laws are completely ridiculous, and this place looks like it's anti decent steak knives. You shouldn't have to saw at it like a neanderthal.
They didn't give you a steak knife. It looks like a butter knife. Extra work. Next time bring your own cutlery. ;)
U animal U!!!  Great show ur putting on here on utube🍿
Don't they give you a sharp steak knife .
you should start bringing your own super sharp knives.  makes all the difference
100 oz... Are you out of your darn mind?
All the South African Boere be like the fat is the best part bro. Maybe because it wasn’t on the braai😂 PS Love your vids Sir Beard
It's the pause for the pics🤣🤣🤣
yo imagine the turd
the question everyones wondering.. what does the bathroom look like after all this. god bless his toilet
But the fat is the tastiest part..
You have clearly never met a yarn snob.
Man that fat on the steak is just begging to be seared! ☺️
The guy said it was 45 minutes for 2 people and an hour for 1 person and that only 3 groups of 2 have complete it.
Damn that looked tough as hell. The meat and the challenge
Did they really give you a butter knife for that? Jesus. No wonder your arms are tired.
#1 ask for a sharper knife
oh I see why they dont call it the 2834.95 gm challenge over there
Jee you're a weapon lad. Good stuff.
Honestly, can anyone eat this way without vomiting shortly thereafter?
You must have an intense workout routine.
after having watched you crush the heartattack burger this is cake lol
Never seen so few napkins used in a challenge!
This looks like a really tough steak. Almost like they cooked it in the microwave. lol
That chocolate cake with cream got me.  One thing we haven't figured out here in the US is how good cream is as a topping on things like chocolate cake.  My Step father turned me on to this and I've always wondered why the hell this isn't a common thing here in the states?  I mean, whipped cream is relatively common.....but simple heavy cream is a divine topping for cakes (among other things)
I don't think they slept with bed warmers, just warmed the bed up before getting in
What woman could resist a man with so much meat!  Haha..  You mentioned Sudocrem. Don't you put that on babies bottoms?  :)    phenomenal..!  Did they knit that bib for you by the way? 🤣  Seriously though, that was a fantastic result my friend...
I’m sure being this good at eating food makes life much cheaper. You can literally just beat these challenges for all of your food.
He said 45 mins for 2 people and 1 hour for one then Beard said 30 mins for 2 and 45mins for 1.  I am confusion
Ever thought of bringing your own steak knife when you do these challenges?
It's unreal nobody believe this
keep up the great work bro your subby from Perth Australia  :) by the way the challenge was 60 min solo 1:11 not 45 4:07 unless they changed the rules : )
Wow that looks like a proper steak...good video.
Got confused with the time limit at 4.00 at 6 minute sth. So its a pair for 45 min, single for 60 min. Impressive as always. Stay healthy buds
This guy must drop some massive turds xD
Seems to me the hardest part of the challenge was cutting up the meat . Looked to me that they gave you a butter knife to cut it with .
I am waiting for the ofended vegans.....
Mr Beard, you have to check your commentary verses the information provided by, I presume, the Landlord. Otherwise, great job, Adam. 👌👍👏👏👏💙
Is it just me or is this the first time I heard him say a word without his accent and sounded American 😳 or am I just tripping. Caught me off guard haha listen closely at 5:37
100 oz. is 6.25 pounds.
The big wedges of fat are the best part.
user a sharper bigger knife to finish faster
Cant believe  u left that  fat. Its the best bit
I thought he was gonna finger shred it and pour the sauce😮 but he went straight to it
How tf he is not fat 😅
Eat the fat too
Just wondering why you never ask for a proper knife on these steak challenges?
Hey beard, should be exelent style to bring your own knife, because you always struggle with the knives from the restaurant
CANT BE ENJOYABLE -- HALF A STEER!!!
DID YOU ASK FOR A STEAK KNIFE!!!  A BUTTER KNIFE WONT DO!!
Oh man that was painful to watch - so much chewing.  But you slayed it!!  Never doubted it for a moment.
This guy got a jaw and teeth of steel..my gums would be hurting chewing that 😪
How about for the nxt challenge, you go in with an ashole persona.. and do some trash talk about how weak the challenge is 😅
You guys got desert ? Has to be disrespectful 🤣🤣🤣🤣
the rind of fat is my fav part lol
Also love onion rings. But I love mushrooms to. Not much of a tomato guy
I really find watching your videos entertaining and I'm not a fan of watching people eat - competitively or not! They are strangely addictive.  Oh - and why no steak knife?! You could've been doing with a tomahawk to get through that steak!
Belum bertemu dengan "TANBOY KUN" this guys
I'm waiting for you to realise your mistake. In the commentary you said 30min for two, 45min for one, but the guy told you 45min for two, 60min solo. Ok, finished the video.... ya smashed it!
The only reason I know what an Oz is is because I smoke weed. Even though I do I don't even come close to eating as much as you!
Please come to India and try Bahubali Thali
Everytime I watch I end up eating more food. Love your channel. Only found it today.  But your definitely making me want to try a few in the uk.
我也好想吃:3
As long as your stomach is working right, meat gets completely broken down. We can't digest fiber at all, though, so all of it goes out...just passing through.
if you could stomach/swallow the fat, it would be the lubricant!
😂😂😂😂NOW that’s a mouth full😊😊😊😊
BeardKnitsFood!
You are the most ENTERTAINING EATER ON THE TUBE BY FAR.I were you,  I'd always ask for a "sharp knife" at ALL STEAK  challenges. But brother I've been watching your videos for a while now and just discovered that I wasn't even SUBSCRIBED !! I am know. You have a REAL TALENT my friend.  Keep on doing what you're doing, it's ADDICTING to watch.
You should ask for a chef’s knife. All these steak knives are a joke and seem to be harder than the challenge itself
How on earth did you manage that ? 😂😂😂😂
Loving the Chutzpa slang 🔥🔥
Wow nice 👏 👌 👍
sawesaw
The fat is the best bit!
Wait a second.......I thought Miss Beard's name was Lindsay.......who is Sharon? As in "I've never been into Sharon"......lol
at 1:00 is your left foot 2x size of right?
Bed warmer: You don't sleep with it. As bed time is nigh, coals from the hearth are shoveled into the pan.  (It has a hinged lid.) Using the wood handle, the warmer is walked up to each bedroom.  The covers are raised on one side of the bed.  The hot pan is slipped between the covers and the mattress, and it is slid all over the mattress.  (Hence the long handle to reach all corners of the mattress.) Then the pan is removed and carried to the next bedroom....  So you never are in bed with brass pan.  It is too hot.  Instead it makes crawling into bed like putting on clothes straight out of the dryer.... FWIW.
Hey Mr Beard, do a trip in France. Your french fans are waiting for you and you will eat some totally new foods.
Bring your own knife. Makes things easier.
Does your doctor approve of this?
when his heart stops..there will be no way to revive him...gluttony and disgusting
How do you eat...  Like you not eating only take in...  It shows not flavour...
One that gets me is that the knifes look so dull.😂
this one is the first time ive seen him look this defeated. lol
you never cease to amaze me
Why do all these places give him butter knives to cut the steak?
Did you pass wind at 5:20min? 🤣
I wonder if he's always hungry as he must of stretched his stomach to twice the normal size it must take a lot of effort to not overeat of his days off
This is the only one of these channels I watch cause you're so damn charming, polite and nice. It's awesome to watch you do these challenges, really entertaining! *cheers on*
Next time put yourself inside a cage and sell tickets for people to look at you.
i know this is an older vid and ive been commenting on others recently but i i think a good strat for a steak challenge....get 2 or maybe 3 knives. ive worked in plenty of restaurants and they're (knives) are never the same....might help in the long run
Alright, gotta ask, did ya go back for the knitting lessons? Haha
Slow clap 👏 😅
@corbuccieats
The ol 96er😂
Beard...your videos are so weirdly addictive, even though I can't get my head around how you do it.  This video is so British as compared to the American competitive eating....just a man in a country pub next to the local knitting club!
My mouth was watering for that fat.🤤
You'd save so much time with a proper steak knife.
Giving a butter knife for a steak challenge lol, they sure know how to make it difficult
You are in Usa eat the meat ´´´´ but in Egypt they are do not can bay meat
How is he not dead?
Holy shit your crazy bro
not as big as the Texas steak huh  sounds like a challange
Unbelieveable
Quit whining about those dishpan hands! 😂
Mate you need to start taking a really sharp knife with you when you go
I want the slab of fat
Great job!!! Next time being your own sharp knife! 😊
Damn dude I just discover a Black hole inside your belly 🤣
Beard, I think maybe what they did was, heat the bed with said device, then remove it and take it back to the fireplace. Pretty sure they didn't sleep next to it.
I mean, not as intimidating as I thought
Is pouring cream on cake normal?
looks dry af
I feel like eating with your hands is way better than using forks and knives.
love your vids but you could stop sounding like you are barfing in the start of each one- annoying
my boy you can sure eat / one of us one of usssss!!!! quoting w.o.w.s
I think that soon a photo of this dude will be hanging on the doors of many restaurants with the sign NO ENTRY FOR YOU.
If you have eaten with hand you would have finished much early without assuming cavemen style .
Gurmi feke benkolund
This guy is amazing at these challenges but fck being his mrs and trying to fill him up 😂 making a proper banquet for every meal 🤦‍♀️
The comment about the bed warmer was cute 😊. Just fyi - People didn't sleep with them in the bed.  They were filled with hot coals,  put between the bedding to warm them and then it was removed so someone could get into a warm bed.
Great job.!
The fat is the best part!! 😮
"Norkolkin' Chance Steak Challenge" is golden 🤣
You should bring your own (sharp) steak knife 😄
In my experience, rump steak is a terrible piece of meat. Tough as heck. I saw a professional do a steak challenge and noted two things. 1) She didn't use a knife or fork. She just picked it up with her hands, and 2) She didn't chew. She would rip off a chunk of meat with her teeth and just swallow it whole.
The desert at the end is always my favorite part.  Keep it up Mr. Beard. Be safe out there
You should bring your own sharp steak knife.
You should get an electric knife 🤟
Береги себя,мужик!)
My God......im 240pounds, i would not aet a 30% from that and would just die if i did..... Congrats and cheers from Russia🎉
Tactical Coke ready for launch
Dude! Impressive....but where does all that food go?? Is there a wormhole in your gut?
Finally a restaurant that serves dog, ive always wanted to try some
Meat sweats😂
Looks a bit overcooked
Well, your body does appreciate so much food for sure.
cmon man, youre a brit, get your own shank at least, would make cutting way easier than this type of knife
your digestive system is a medical marvel
Okay I see the color line coming they don't care about our race listen to what he said white everything is 😢😢 please don't teach the kids it's okay
I always wonder How this guy eat's a ton and never gets fat (is he doing fasting on no challenge days) ???
You can't fit that in your stomach.   Well at least it doesn't come with a bucket full of chips.
Amazing 👏
Too much England, not enough US
How is it that he doesn't even get fat....strange.....
what's with the butter knife for a steak?
Сколько заходит, столько и выходит?
did this mf call me a "beardling"? lol
How in the world you always have room for dessert?
Why wouldn't you have your own steak knife to take to a steak fight? Good advertising - your weapon of choice vs. steak!
Its in Norfuk 😂love the accent ✅
Eat the fat Adam. It is good for you!
Sorry for the lang but HOW THE FUCK WAS THAT HUMANLY POSSIBLE????????????????????
What a beast!  I feel like a steak knife would have taken a few minutes off and saved the hands.
Keep hearing time limit of 45 minutes and an hour you are confused.
Just some info in case nobody has mentioned it.  The bedpan was put in the bed to warm it up approx an hour before the person went to bed then it was removed. So no danger of sleeping with a pan full of hot coals.  Now a question...why do you always pull that weird face when someone takes your photo? Edit...If you keep on doing steak challenges we'll have to re-name you Sir Loin.
That fat gotta have tons of flavor 🤤
The fat is the best part!!!!
that steak looks so overdone
That item is a Victorian Bed Warmer.
This man is crazy eats a baby's weight of steak and sides then has a peace of cake 😂😂
Why don't these places sharpen their steak knives? It'd make the cutting so much easier! Or have I just answered my own question???
It's go weird seeing a place that is down the road from home.
Don’t get it?? He knows he can eat the food yet goes around taking the piss , getting food for free and getting away with it??? Get some cocky Herbert who reckons they can eat it but ain’t got a chance
the thing i dont get, is why these huge steak challenges always give you such shitty knives. must be so hard to chop it up
Is that a butter knife?
Battery operated knife 👀 . 🌎✌️🖖Eat
Here is what I think. I think you are a secret Canadian b/c the only people I know that are so polite (aka ) please, thank you, may I, I can get it myself I don't want to bother you, and sorry are Canadians and now you!!!!!! Well, done fellow Canadian in all your endeavors. You make us proud. Hugs to you and Mrs. Beard from British Columbia Canada
YAY! Mushrooms!
that was a slog! Cheers from Vancouver!
Rump steak...  that's a rough cut. Congrats. Don't forget to drink senna tea, eat lot's of psyllium husks, bran,  and a big load of ex-lax!
How do you feel about Leeds United?
How long do you sleep for after pulling off some shit like this bro
your jaw muscles should be the size of your forearms by now LOL
Would love to see a few more colabs like this one! What a feature
I totally didnt read it as a 1000 ounce steak...
He said they start the clock when he cuts into the steak.  I would’ve started eating the sides first😂 then cut the steak
All the fat people getting mad he didn't eat there favourite part lmao
Why don’t you ask for a sharper kitchen knife for these challenges?
The dorky awkwardness really puts me off these videos.
How would it be to beat that challenge as a team, that has less than a 10% success rate. And someone comes in solo and beats your time
Just subscribed and am watching through all the challenges, They are all good but I especially enjoyed this one cause you could tell they were just super excited to see you knowing you'd most likely break a record too,  There was no extra sized portions or anything like that, just a bearded man eating a 100oz steak and a room full of people enjoying every moment of it😊  Real feel good stuff👌 great work beard
what a lovely lady asking if its ok to sit behind you
You’re a professional.  Why not carry your own knife?  Very sharp with a thicker handle.
You better bring your own knife (assuming you have a sharp knife...) for that kind of challenge.
Wow! That's unbelievable feast.🎉
So clean, so gentle, you are the winner on every aspect!
Sf2 theme when the continue sign shows up
Greetings beardlings 😂😂
You’re poor heart 😮
Is that a butter knife for goodness sakes
You should bring your own super sharp knife.
That side eye @10:35. Haha
Your a legend my G  !!!
is desert for the taste or is for the sugar rush to make sure you can get home before you succumb to a food coma.😆
Norfolkn chance steak challenge is brilliant.
Two eat that? That looks easy..
Can you bring your own knief for these???
🙂👍
where the hell do you put it ? what a man.
Not even done with the video, but damn, this restaurant and staff are so welcoming, amazing!
Hey beard I have an idea you should take your own super sharp knife with you help you cut thru large cuts of meat ? Shit maybe even a custom fork 😂
He doesnt show a sign of giving up. Gr8
Beards plumber should get his own youtube channel.. meet beards turd
Were there any challenges where you had to eat the grizzle?
The irony is the beef fat would have been a healthier helper for digestion than the BBQ sauce. Old school health tips die hard
Damn this man toilet must have words for him 😂😂😂😂😂 ate that like it was nothing
someone should x-ray you before, and then soon after...  would love to see the undigested meats throughout your digestive system...
Mushrooms are delicious, idk what you’re on about
I couldn't do this because everyone constantly bothering me would distract me.
give the man some real utensils
As always, unbelievable....an amazing feat once again...
bro did it solo and did it only 6 mins late
I think you need to invest in a good quality steak knife with a comfy handle, I’m sure they’d be okay with you using your own right?  Love your vids btw beard!
didnt even give you a steak knife....seems like they could have done better.
Absolute lad, great Colab with the knitting club 👏👏👏
I don’t know how to say in english..but he is a eater, he should take it slow.he only has one stomach and one life.
brilliant mate
Could you do a video of how much money you saved by winning all the challenges you’ve done?
We gotta get you an electric knife!!
I always think he’s going to bite his fingers lol
New channel, BeardMeatsKnitting
That steak looks tough as boots!
When I see a delicious crusted meat or chicken. Just don't understand vegans how do you live without meat!
How does he stay in shape
Big well done Bro 👏
Why don't you have a ULTRA SHARP steak knife to lazer cut your way through meat in these situations, You seem to always get butter knives, and it seems like that slows you down alot, Maybe get an electric carving knive? Samurai Sword? Light Sabre?!?!
this cant be real
A gentleman always carries his own, sharpe knife
i dont eat that much food in a month tho ur a monster 😂
Who the fuck puts barbecue sauce on a steak
He should get 90 minutes, not 60 minutes.
he needs an electric steak knife for these challenges with the steak .  lol
what does Beard say before chowing down on his food?
How?
So I watch Adam's video more than most I'd say. The customer service at this good ol pub looks brilliant. If I'm ever in the area I'll definitely be stopping in for a bit, maybe not one quite this big though! 😂
Should eat the mushrooms with the steak
I saw John Candy complete this challenge years ago. It was called the old 96er!
That rine of fat look like it still needed cooking, When I cook a steak I usually use tongs to hold the steak on the rine and cook that for 30-60sec before normal searing
100 ounces? Utter, pure insanity. How do you gnaw thru that much meat in one sitting?
He beat that challenge well within the time they would allow 2 people to do this... Thats..  just... I can't.
did they teach you how to knit?
Dudes a beast! Each video I think this is the one he can’t complete but then he does it. Crazy stuff
Watching this while eating a steak is great!
ngl i think with peppercorn sauce i could do this
I eat a 16 oz prime ribeye and i wake up in the middle of the nights drenched in the meat sweats and my stomach still feels like I just finished eating. I cannot imagine the feeling after this.
That’s dry
The Beard Man has something. I find myself watch. And again. Don't know why. Millions can't be wrong. Saltute. Dont tell how you do it. Cheers
They gave him a butter knife to cut a steak 🎉🎉🎉
Your colon hates you!
Its so funny that he has to use a butter knife to cut this huge ass steak... cause UK.
starts at 314
❤😂🎉 SUBBED... AMAZING, no doubt.... 😊
Wow yeah bro you are a beast I would have tapped out just looking at the steak! Looking at the desert it looks scrumptious
“Well now your backs gonna hurt cuz you just pulled landscaping duty”
Half the challenge is using a butter knife.
I have an uncle that eats 7 regular size steaks all the time
Did they not give you a steak knife??
bon apitite . famous John Candy line from the great outdoors when he does the steak the ole 76er
That bed warming implement would have been used _before_ going to bed. Basically it was put under the sheets and moved all over the bed for a moment and then removed so your bed was warm and toasty on a cold night. You wouldn't leave it in otherwise you'd have a house fire on your hands. I'm not old enough to have seen that used but I've seen it in a movie or documentary somewhere.
What is the recovery process for this?
Really... really... really...the fat is part of the steak...so in a way you didn't complete the 100oz steak... would be better if the restaurant had a steak knife instead of a butter knife...oh well... congratulations on completing your steak challenge...
I think mrs Beard should treat you to an electronic serrated knife just for you're steak challenges save on you're hands well done Adam you're awsome
they gave u a butterknife to cut a steak with!
Adam that was impressive 💪
Anyone who eats British food in measurements of multiple kilos is a sociopath.
I was going to check if you have done a steak yet, and I guess you have.
Love the "Confessions of a Window Cleaner" soundtrack.
You amaze me where do you put it all?
For ya steak challange, what about one of those moulinex  electric knives. They prob do cordless these days. Would it be allowed? Anyway it looked the bizz. Top bloke!!
Hey…..ya missed a bite mate ……..roflmao…… where do you put it ?? Lol
অনেক মজার খাবার ছিল এত অল্প সময় এত খাবার খাওয়া সত্যিই ভয়ানক ভালো লাগলো ভিডিওটা দেখে মজার ভিডিও
Amazing as usual good job 👏..
"Norfolk'n Chance Challenge! Brilliant!
When will you do a seafood challenge???
That device is called a bed warmer. You put hot coals from the fireplace in it and pass it between the bed and the blankets just before crawling in. You don't sleep with it!
This guys toilet must take an absolute battering
I would totally eat those tomatoes.
That baby looked legit scared!!!
Impressive
The staff and customers of that restaurant were amazing.
A better knife might have made it easier!
did you do the BIG TEXAN 72 OZ steak challenge?
Once again awsome video. Cheers
You're both a legend and an absolute madman.
Give him a proper steak knife
Amazing mate !!! Loved the way you picked up the onion rings like you thought ?? No more steak thank god !!! Lovely video thanks
I’m not an Englishmen, but we won’t the league at shite heart lane.
Did they give you a butter knife to cut meat with??
That steaks a bit too over cooked for me.  I prefer it with a bit more moo.
I am SHOCKED!!!!  I did the one in TX and failed miserably!  This is amazing!  wow!  lol
How many calories?
His tummy is a blackhole
Is that a butter knife?? Don't they believe in real knives?? Haha
it's always nice to see how many people are always so nice about him recording and not wanting to distract him. it's really refreshing to know nice people are still out there
Meat sweats at the 5 minute mark! Good job mate.
My issue is I get flavor fatigue within a fist full of food tops. I have to have a variety otherwise I end up eating not shit lol
A++
How is this guy still so skinny 😂
You must have one helluva dump after these meals.
*looking at the steak at the start*  Dude your jaw will HURT like hell in the end  .... Get a Blender XD
The prices for these huge meals seem low, like to buy raw meat would cost more
That is a GIANT steak
This guy must have some crazy hemorrhoids
Stop talking about your beard makes me want to unfollow you
👍
How many napkins did you use in this video?
My jaw was literally aching watching you eat that steak 🥩
That’s a joint of beef not a steak 🥩 😂
I gt a kick out of watching the food challenges.
The steak looks like horse, overcooked and tough as a boot. Plus they gave you a table knife to cut it. Amazing.
Great job!
That's amazing
Why did they give him a butter knife to eat a quarter cow with?
Man.. he could of took a half hour power nap after the steak with time to spare to finish some onion rings.
Challenge was hard enough without them overcooking the meat :( looks tough as an old boot
give the man a steak knife!
Those ladies were so sweet! Just knitting ❤
I can respect everything about this man except his shoes
His house plumbing must be top fkn notch lol just massive dueces.
This man is insane
Yes that is a bed warmer it was filled with coals then used to warm the blankets and bed before you got into bed. It was not left in to keep warming.
That would literally kill me.
well done i couldnt eat a quarter of it well done i would be willing to try it rare though.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
so did you learn how to knit?
The chairs in this place belong in an old fashioned hotel conference room uggghhh the ptsd!!!! Lolololol
WTF for a knife is that to eat a steak with its not even jagged  lmfao
Bonkers - Sunday roast for 8
The brow raise when he heard the word “anal”. Lmao my kind of childishness.
You’re amazing! WOW
Thats a sturdy chair.
and not a shred of seasoning was found
After that steak, bro was starting to struggle.
why not a steak knife? wtf
Did they give you a butter knife to cut with?
Sad to see you avoid the fat, another win for the sugar industry.
YOU are NOT Human!
I can’t wait for the sequel on the “ManShitsBricks” channel.
You're a very pleasant lad. Keep smashing it mate <3
Don’t know how you do it Beard, but I love watching your videos xxx
A midwife thinks that was the same weight as a viable baby? Tarrare the human stomach was accused of eating a baby when he was in hospital.... I am even more convinced that you are from that same bloodline lol
7:45 you take it out before you go to bed
I bet the meat sweats after were incredible
Beast.
I think you are a hobbit... its the only thing that makes sense to your accent and the amount of food you eat XD
Open toe flip flops—— oh my
Why the Hell didn't They give You an ACTUAL Sharp Steak Knife... 🔪 🤔
Also just recently found BMF. What a delightful guy. You were raised well son… very good manners. Cheers
maybe get a steak knife next time xD
You are amazing bro
7:41 yes that's a bed pan warmer and it was supposed to go under the mattress.
Eat this steak... gives you a butter knife....
Did you have a great big nap after Adam? 😊
Doggy menue ? As in actual dogs??
U DONT BELIEVE IN MEAT SWEATS?
Looks overcooked. That makes it harder to eat.
You not fucking with Joel hansen
Yikes, cooked well done? That's EXTRA difficulty right there...
That’s down the road from me lol 😂
I'd love to see a food challenge featuring Beardyman tbh
Jealous that I can't eat like that though it seems like sometimes it may not be all that enjoyable
You got black hole in your stomach?
That baby seemed so happy lol great vids as always brotha
🥩 🔪?
steak looks dry as all get-out
All of the desserts look even better after hes finished the challenge
Hes so friendly🙂
God I love this guy
How do you not take a fry or ring in between some of the steak to get a different taste for a sec
That looked dry as fuck, condolences
They said an hour. Did they change it on you?
2.8 kg Steak... thats hilarious 😂
IF YOUR ARMS HURT FROM ALL THE CUTTING, ASK FOR A SHARPER KNIFE😁
How is that possible
Cheeky eyebrow raise when he said anal
Why don't you mix bites of food, a little this a little that?
It looks a bit dry
Your videos are the best they keep going and hungry throughout the day
I am always amazed by these videos but the dessert after is unreal.
Ohh l betting on ya lad . .that ya can dooooooo it. 😜😎👍🤠
Stop making that ridiculous dumb sound when you begin a challenge. Unsubbed
There's no way you use indoor plumbing for your bowel movements
The fat is the best part :P lol
Now that you've eaten lots of different steaks and lots of different countries in places where do you say your best steak  That you've eaten was from
Steak food looked great , but nothing to be proud of you can't enjoy it
How do you do it ..brilliant man..really impressed 👏
You like f****** Eddie Hall let's make up some s*** with run over somebody's car in a tank you got nothing better to do to make content really I respected you cuz you did s*** that nobody could do
One person that underscrub to you is not going to change your 2.5 million views you're not doing s*** defeating challenges that you know that you can f****** do and you know what that shitt gets old do something that you can't do I wish you the best of luck my friend
Ahh the way you ate that cake 😂😂 looked soo good
Dude I wouldn’t even be able to eat half of that in an entire day let alone 60 minutes.
for godsakes man trim that renegade caterpillar you have on your lip :)   that has to be annoying and it looks nasty when you constantly have to dig it out of your mouth ><
It appears that you weren’t given a steak knife.
I think you are mean’t to take the ‘bed warmer’ out of the bed before climbing in 👍
A relief to see so few fries, or chips, usually they give you 10x that much.
Looks dry.  I noticed all steak challenge they purposely over cook the steak.
Wouldn't eat the fat drscusting
"Who is posh enough to buy their dog rump steak?"  Me.  If I brought him somewhere that allowed him in and got food, I sure as hell would buy Kush a rump steak.  Good boy deserves it after dancing for everyone else that has food as we enter.
Hope someone knows the hymanlick manerva.
no way they gave you a butter knife to cut that FAT steak XD
Nice town
Your jaw must hurt after eating that
This man has cows moonwalking when they see him walk, run, ride or drive by instantly. Word around the heard.. he's the grim reaper ..🤣
You should bring your own knife so it would be easier to cut the steak.
Eat the fat, its the best part
Lol that would be my grandma .. he has a kinds of knitting vids on her playlisy
Huh! Where does it go?
Oh - The White TART inn, I see - my bad
LOL! greetings Beard from the Pacific Northwest ..The State of Washington..we just love your videos..thanks so much  they are so much fun to watch..true class act..just subscribed..take care..
Bro get out of here!
You are a Beast!
The lady , she's so cool
Talk about a reprise of "The Great Outdoors" and the old 96er challenge!  This was entertaining.
he asked for bbq sauce very smart as stated that meat was dry AF
You may not of "Had Too" but i am disappointed you didn't eat the "Fat" ........
A butcher knife would help.
Man you are going to get a heat attack ! Sop eating all that meat,seriously 😮
Gettin the "Meat Sweats".
Isn’t the food cold by the time he eats it!?
The fat is the best part.
The knife looks so dull.
should have had a steak knife with that 😆
Lame cutlery. Should have given you a decent steak knife. Meat looks poor quality.
What a credit you are to the food and beverage industry kirstian. I wish you all the success in the world.  An absolute gentleman.
Im keeping that fat! You can cook some beans with that!!!
That glance at the camera when he said anal 😂😂😂 now that’s my kind of humor!
Can a cutlery company get this man a sharp steak knife??? Come on!
There's always room for fudge cake.
Dude I frickin love the shoes 👍
Hmm in the beginning they say 60 minutes if solo 😅
‘I draw the line at babies’ 🤣🤣🤣🤣 STOP..!! That was one cute baby though 😍❤️
Keeping it really casual with those flip flops huh?  🤦🏼‍♀️
at 4:05 - 4:06 mark you said the timers wrong - it's 45 minutes for a pair and 60 minutes for a single and you said it was 30 for a pair and 45 for a single.
About 1.2 kg is the most I could eat and it also was prime quality steak.  But I didn't took sides apart from some fries.
You didn't need a steak knife, you needed a carving knife!!!
I don't see how he does it. He must have hollow legs. Lol.
tyre challenge
Brilliant videos  ... but could we please have a video of all your tee shirts and memorabilia  ?
Hi Mr Beard!!  I loves ya but you are knucken futz!!  Well done!!
Why a butter knife though, that's a workout.
Loved the Knitting Ladies!!! 😃😃😃❤❤❤
Nice work Adam!
We think having a knitting community is strange....meanwhile here we are :
So. Much.food….
The whole video…the purest moment was the very last “It’s nice”
Steak knife 🗡 might help
I'd bet I could do that million percent
I'd deffo Try that challenge any day
That looks so yummy. I like the friendly staff too.
Another challenge nailed and even room for dessert lol
How do you train to obtain that amount of food.... ?? I'd need a poo half way through.
Invest in Wüsthof Classic steak knives ,, expensive ,, but cut any  steak , ever so easy
You'd have made an amazing hunter gatherer! You absolute animal. Mad luv blue. ! 👊👍💛💛
I would think it would help to mix sides in with all that beef
That knife is a joke.
I wouldn't mind eating that meal... Fat and all. Irrespective of being a challenge meal...
The baby smiling is priceless tho xD
What a ledge 😂😂😂😂😂😂
If the steak is cooked right you don’t need any sauces
If I were you I’d take a nice juicy bite off the fat for the one time 😫
Food!
It's overcooked! I'd rage quit half way through just because i'm sick of chewing
Looking forward to a few sides now 🤣 🤢
The steak looks rather grey, and they didn’t even give you a steak knife 🔪
What's your fitness regime beardman? do you fast between your binges?
Finally....a Steak Challenge. Not a Chips Challenge 👍💪
The fat is the best part of the steak. Just found out about this channel.  Brattleboro, Vermont loves the channel. You the man!!!
60 minutes is ROOKIE numbers for beardmeatsfood
"I won't eat you mate, I draw the line at babies" that line should have garnered more laughs.
How do you stay in such reasonable shape, considering the volume of food you eat??? I’m impressed
Sick of wasting money making tonnes of food after watching Beard videos that I can’t finish 😂
Couldn't help but think of "I ate a babbi" from Austin powers.
What kind of steak is that?
Do you cut across the grain on your steaks to make the chewing easier?
10:35 haha
Give that man a proper steak knife
How?
I just realized I spent over 11 minutes of my life watching a dude eating a giant steak without even realizing 11minutes had past by. Bruh...
legend says his stomach is a void
amazing
"don't worry mate. I draw the line at babies" 😂😂😂😂 I lost I dude
i ate the 79er in 25min with sides
Imagine being ok with eating 6-7 lbs of food in one sitting but you draw the line at eating a little bit of fat on the meat...
The videos always end abruptly, it would be nice to see some footage afterwards talking to the staff & customers etc!
Wow, that was impressive but why did they give you what looks to be  a butter knife to cut it with? Hard enough without struggling to cut it
I'm curious why you don't carry your own extra sharp knife with you ?
IMPOSSIBLE MISSION.. you are an eating machine.. how big is your stomach can be?
Great Video thanks for sharing this challenge 👍👏❤️
Why are you not morbidly obese ?
Amazing Job, all aside, they could have given you a steak knife instead of a butter knife
I would love to try this, but I don't like tomatoes, & I hate mushrooms
You very much have too get away from the moniker beardlings ., Not good at all Big Beard
Great video, as usual
How can u eat so much ,imnearly 7 feethigh but this amount of food itsincredible .
My buddy Logan would eat that everyday after school haha
I always wonder are you ever worried about stomach issues in the future from doing these challenges ? Have you spoken to a Dr about the future issues you may face?
What does the Diet Coke do? Lubricate?
I think that when you turn the camera off you put your fingers down your throat and vomit it all up,otherwise you will be doing yourself damaged by eating all that.
i don't want to sound rude, but it must somehow be "technically" possible to stow all the food in one, i.e. digest it immediately and turn it into poop that it ends up in the intestine. can't imagine that otherwise with someone wearing a size m shirt.
You're an animal bro! That was impressive
Just noticed at least there was only a few chips!
is it weird i watch these vids while i eat lmao 😂
Eating with cutlery for once
Might help if they gave you something better than a damn butter knife to cut it with lol
All that BBQ sauce for nothing
You smashed that mate...  fork ing el! Well done given the record and the weight! Credit where credit is due!  You could be a millionaire if you worked for the columbians. Imagine 100oz a trip.   You would not need YT 🤣
2 seconds in and I had to pause at "Beardlings". 🤣🤣
Not complete til you eat the fat that is part of the steak 😂
This guy is a legend
U got the way the fat man that's best bit
Theres your next challenge... to eat a viable baby 🤣
Didnt even give him a steak knife 😲
TO ADD FLAVOR TO THE MEAT YOU COULD INCLUDE THE MUSHROOMS IN A FEEW BITES BRO
Do you at least tip tip the waitresses
Is that you M2k?
should gave you at least steak knife lol
They could have least given you a sharp knife
Damn Adam, that was impressive!
he pooped a cow the next day
You should get a really sharp kitchen knife to bring with you for these challenges, too many hurt fingers!
That's not a big steak. It's an overcooked rump roast.   No bueno 🗑️
That was not a steak.  It was a roast.  I hated my Dad's wife's roast beef because she cooked the heck out of it.  This looked much better and juicier.  The sides looked good.  Did the greens have any dressing?  I think you may have eaten the fancy garnish.
When I saw that steak I've never experienced a bigger "Holy Shit" moment before in my entire life. I wish I had that monstrousity right here to feast on.
Get lost mate, all those challenge you do are impossible for me to finish, but a steak like that... I'd kill it within 10 minutes on my own. (Just the steak though)
holy cow thats 6lbs4ounces of meat.  love watching your series dude.  fellow bearded guy out in new york =)
That steak looks hard af 😂😂😂😂😂
You’re a machine! Live long and prosper 🖖
People have died eating that in one sitting…. This mad lad does it for fun.
Gaston! A bucket for monsieur!
my man just ate 740g of protein like nothing
Lady is back there knittin'. What in bloody ell. 🙀🙊🙉🙈😱
Absolute legend, thanks for the smiles 👍
Why didn't they give him a steak knife !
bruh beard meats food has the strat, go to restaurants finesse their food for free and peace out
Beards steak is 100 ounces, or 6.35 POUNDS of steak. You're a legit worldiwide class pro competitive eater! You're attitude makes your stomach even bigger. Ily!
Come for the novelty of eating challenges. Stay for the nice friendly bloke that loves everyone and everyone loves.
Your camera face is hilarious.
that was a shite piece of meat and they over cooked it - nice work Beard - you're a beast bro
The movie Great outdoors with John Candy where he eats a ginormous steak the old 96er you should try that that be real cool eat something similar to that
eating a whole cow..literally
100 ounces is 6.25 pounds of beef. Surely this is precooked weight. The beef looks might tasty. But, I would quit at 1/2 a pound of beef. Maybe in my younger years. But, today? No way!
Don't use cutlery when doing those challeges. Just use hands. You can save more time.
made me get up and go eat at 4 in the night :)
Those ladies were so sweet! 10/10 collab
They should have a band and parade when they bring that beast out of the kitchen!!
im from kings lynn didnt know about this
I got a question man, how do you eat that much and still in figure??
you aren't wrong when you called yourself a professional pig, haha. nicely done there mate.
somebody give that boy a real steak knife...
I don't know how he stays so small and fit he must have an incredible motabalizm I would have to smoke a lot of weed just to have his appetite
Do you have a quiet spot somewhere that you lay down and whimper for hours until you slip into a food coma ?
Get the fat eaten 🤣🤣 best part of the steak...👍👍🙏
Imagine the 100oz shit he took after.
I would eat the fat
The fat adds so much flavor...yummy
Tell us what planet your from!
They were trying to wear you down by not offering a sharper knife.  Fools!
I'm GENUINELY curious if you've ever been like "bloody hell I DON'T want to eat this dessert" but have done it for posterity anyhow.
That's 3kg. I've not finished watching yet but I have to say I don't reckon you'll do it! 3kg is insane! EDIT: well, I was wrong! Hot damn.
Animal 😉
‘Tis no man! ‘Tis a remorseless eating machine! Arrr!
Back in my younger days (2 decade's ago) I challenged the 77oz steak at a Outback Steakhouse with all the fixings fries mashed taters and a gallon of gravy it was delicious you had 77 mins to complete alone if you didn't it was a $155 meal I being fresh out of college was of course broke but man I was starving I cleared that plate in 25 mins but the walk home took well over a hour and half 🤣 worth it.
Try a bread knife and slice it thin
Just pick it up with your hands and go for it😂😂😂
Mid rare to rare or no deal, I would eat the fat also
Is that a cooked dinosaur meat
Overdone steak and no fat, brutal  Fat is flavor 🥩
...barbecue sauce...?
All these restaurants are doing is feeding this human garbage disposal!🤯 What they should do is double up on the double up portions, and give him less time🤔⏳️
My jaw hurts just looking at that thing. This reminds me of steaks in the Flintstones.
What is an oz in real measurements? About 30g?
I still do not understand how a stomach can fit all of that, lol. I used to eat alot, but nothing like that. My meal at work every day was almost four pounds, and it flipped everyone out that I could eat it, but this is insanity.
No! You cant get rid of the fat, crazy when people do that, its the best part!!but in a challenge i understand its less to eat
That’s a real colon clogger there…
Proper mr
duuuude how do you pass on that cap?!?! shit is gold!
Wayyyyy too done!
That's a roast!
Question, how long of a Nap do you have to take after you have eaten lots of food? cause on some of them its like "yeah if I ate that, I am hibernating the winter"
3.5 pints of mineral oil was ingested after recording this video to move that freight meal out  past the caboose.
About 6 videos in, you’re an animal! I bet you lay a depth charge after each of these 😂
THEY COULD HAVE AT LEAST CRISPED UP THE FAT OF THE STEAK
Aww my favorite part of steak is the fat
There is one in Amarillo Texas of these... so good my grandpa did it twice I did it when I was in high school football... steak challenge is amazing
10:42  The lady in the back clapping is the best.
Good grief - well done
What kinda steak sauce is that?
what does he use to wash his beard when hes done?
Dude, youre a friggin champ. Well done.
Eat the fat lame boy
did they give you a butter knife???
Needed a real knife. Less sawing more slicing
You gonna get the meat sweats
Hey, I agree! 😤 You have to have the right type of wool or else it's itchy lol
my kinda  steak       food porn     grin
I'll eat the fatty rind
Wow, can you pronounce gout? I know if I even look at that much meat, I would get it.  Congrats  !!!
I think you needed a much sharper steak knife.
Kom on men🤣
Let me make my self clear. You might look out for your total calories so that you don't get fat. But ingesting such large amounts of nutrients at one sitting will ruin your body. Your body can't handle eating for 6 people at one sitting.
Steak is heavy duty to eat 😋
Just ask for more if you need it 😏
I enjoy seeing him eat but I just can't deal with it when the food be in his Beard l just wish he would trim it down some sorry.
You Brits and your well done steaks 😂😮
Did you chew on a tennis ball in preparation?
Adam do you ever take a break from the competitive eating? If so, what’s your routine?
They don’t even have a 100 oz steak over here in Texas!!!
fussy eater holy smoke, dont eat this dont eat that. the fat si the best part of the steak...
damn the hardest part of the challenge is that that "steak" is overcooked. Must be dry and tough
How do you stay so damn skinny??? Love the vids. It’s always interesting to see these huge meals. Especially since a you travel and expose us to dishes from all over
You did a Phenomenal job Beard... 👏🏽 🙌🏽 👌 ❤️
You make it look easy. And..delicious.
don't they have steak knives in that town?
I've always enjoyed a bit of (but not too much) fat with my steaks. Yum..
Guys eating tons of food in a small amount of time is so fun to watch 😂😂😂😂
I realize you can't in the UK but its things like this that make me think carrying your own steak knife would be a good idea. something sharp enough to make easy work of even the toughest of steak
The ol' 96er from The Great Outdoors. Except here, they didn't require the fat strip. It's still pretty cool. The meal looks amazingly tasty.
I was thinking it didn't seem that big of a deal, until he sat behind it. My personal record for steak is 1.2kg (around 40-45 ounces), just the idea of eating 2 and a half times more than that is just insane, especially (I'm sorry, my italian heritage compels me to say it 🤣) if it's cooked so much! A steak well done is not a well done steak.
Is it just me or am i the only one that realised his hand may be hurting because they didnt give him a proper steak knife with a thick handle🤔
When they gave you a smaller fork and nearly a butter knife I was thinking, oh boy thats going to make this wayyy harder.
OMG he's the best 😁
It ain’t official if you don’t eat that fat … IMHO. Well done sir …
I love eating, and watching someone else eating good food comes a close second.
Can we just imagine the size of shits that this Chad must produce following these feats!!!!!
Dead meat eat near death journey.
You need to start showing how swollen your stomach is after these challenges ?
60 min for single 45 for pairs
Brother, you are something else man. No idea how your stomach can handle this much meat and not explode or vomit. Well done you animal!
why wasn't u given a steak knife
You should bring your own super sharp knife to these challenges. It would help your hands.
Wish I could eat like that, so jealous 😋
so hungry.... so jelous
That steak alone would be the perfect challenge for someone who is doing carnivore.
100 oz, raw weigh for sure.
That steak does not look tender....sheesh.
And then he gets fucking dessert. Love it.
He said 60 minutes by yourself and 45 minutes with a mate
How much is a steak that big cost here?
What a freaking Rockstar! Been watching your videos the past week.. got a new fan and supporter out of me💯 Wholesome, great humor and very humble. Awesome content mate! Keep up the amazing work and eating, cheers!
No wonder other countries hate white ppl. You could feed a small village wit all that for a day....and we make a game out of it. For no reason but amusement, nlt hunger or starvation.
Why wouldn't you mix the sides with it as you go? Easier on the digestive system m8
that little baby is so darn cute!
How do you do it Adam where do you put all that food 😋 does your stomach ever hurt after you eat 😂 and you're so funny too 😅
The fat be the best part
I know I’m gross but I want to eat the fatty rinds
Those knitting ladies were great, almost stole the show from ya. Lol
Surprised they didn't give you a proper steak knife?!
Can you call it a 100 ounzer if your not eating the big bit of fat?  They should give you 100 oz of meat to make it  100 ounzer lol
Watching this while dieting for a show!
Surrounded by lovely people there, that's nice
my first thought also was do you have to eat that fat 😅
Watching again 🥰🥰🥰
Dude I love your videos but damn man.Aren’t you afraid of fucking your body up doing that shit? Oh wait, never-mind. I’ve been drinking 3 days in a row. So…..😂😂😂
Someone probably already said this but you need to watch The Great Outdoors if you have not.  The old 96er LOL.
I like your shoes.
I hope you didn't suffer too much after eating that, I'd want to put more veggies between portions of meat than what they gave you!
It’s 45 minutes and an hour
I’m curious to know if this is ever satisfied with regular meals. Like if I had him and his lady over with friends for the night, and we had a few beers and pizza like could he be satisfied with 3-5 slices of pizza or would he be 2 whole pizzas deep looking for more?
Might have been easier with a better knife
You are a beast, sir!  🙂  Well done - remarkable.
Never watch these videos when your hungry  lol
Anyone else notice he messed the times up when we was repeating it off camera
Mr. Beard, you ought to eat steak rare, much easier on the jaw.
Brother asked for a dessert 🤣 🤣
Watching you is a pleasure compared to Nathan's Hot Dog eating contest. I'm a beef eater and in my younger years I may have attempted this, but that's just a maybe. Sauteed Onions, Ketchup, Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce, and Sweet Butter cooked in a sauce pan makes the best steak sauce.
You know damn well the plumber makes bank off this dude. 👍
That steak looks like shoe leather. Beard has to saw through it, I’d be pissed if I was gonna attempt that challenge and had to eat that
Idk how your stomach doesn’t burst
4 baby sides and a few leaves… easy.
what an intresting affliction...
Wow that's unbelievable yum yum
You my man are a beast no Root beer but kudo's to saving the onion rings for last.
What A Pig..
I like how you're modest in your behaviour. Refreshing.
I get asking for a dessert menu as a joke but actually eating it after a meal like that man that's epic!
Blessed are those who eat anything and everything and in any quantity, yet remain healthy.
What a nice town I swear every single person in this video was extremely kind and polite
Nooooo, fat with the meat is the best, yummy
4:05 as a pair you get 45 min not 30 and single you got 60 minutes not 45. Personally I couldn't even eat a 10th of that.
I have two questions. My first is why are 2.4 mill people subscribe to a channel with a man who just eats, my second is, why am I on my tenth episode.
WOW! impressive!!!
I enjoy your shows, but as a rock and roller, change the music please.  It sounds like somebody played Led Zeppelin to an AI and then ran the instruction set: “Imagine eating this meal is a video game soundtrack.”  Eat on, beard well.
Biggest I have done is a 32oz steak with salad, beans, mashed potatoes and drinks. I cant imagine eating 3 times as much in the same amount of time. My stomach is not big enough, and my digestive system would break.
Thats too much meat, and a cut thats way too thick.
The driest steak challenge
This guy is double greedy..
Thanks for believing in me!
Not making him eat the fat was their mistake…fat is super satiating and once you have had enough your body will literally make you stop.
Need lubricant because its done well, like burnt well lol. ew
It's impossible to not love this guy! Shout out to his parents. 👍
No, should’ve eaten the fat chunk too
That's alot of meat bro, It looked tasty.
I’m hungry now…
Its gonna hurt more coming out than it did going in
What a world we live in where gluttony is glorified its conspicuous consumption at its worst.
Did you learn how to knit tho? Well done champ! You always make these things look so easy!
My jaw got tired and I got second-hand meat sweats from this video. Top stuff, mate.
curious - whenever you order a coke do they charge you for it
Could’ve gave you an actual knife😏
KNIT ME A BIB!   THAT'S SO FUCKEN FUNNY!  <(￣︶￣)>
Should have asked for a sharp knife saves time
Mmmm now I really want a steak with sauteed mushrooms and onions on it...just not THAT much steak! 🤣🤣
So, when you get back to your car after wolfing it all down.  How long of a nap do you take before driving home?
They should have at least been so kind as to give u a steak knife but oh well lmao
jesus christ english legs and toes are about as bad as their teeth
Eating dessert has never been seen as such a flex
Were do you put it
Leave the fat! It's the best bit 😎
The close up of eating cake💀
That doesn’t even look that bad ngl
Next time, just cut up your steak Completely before 1st bite if possible
Amazing.
If they would have given you a real steak knife would have help a bunch
I laughed my ass off when you said I'm not into sharing
I want to see his stomach after that, also his work out rutines. I really like this guy and the content of this channel.
loved everything about this challenge! Food looked bomb, the place was laidback and everyone was friendly! this was the most impressive challenge you’ve done IMO because you still had over 20 mins left!!
Beard Beardlings lol
I think I'd steak my life on you doing this challenge
It always amazes me how people 1/3 my size, can eat 3 times as much food.
This guy a beast. Great videos . I was never into watching food challenges but his videos caught my eye .
You have a king stomatch🎉
This would have been so much easier with a large kitchen knife. Quarter of your time was spent cutting.
Why did they give you a butter knife?? 😂
What a dreammeal ! :D
I hope they give the next challenger a real steak knife and maybe not cook it so done. Triple digit on the ounces ... insanity!
that steak looks amazing!
OMG 👍❤️
I know this man drop some sick dookies
Imagine him going to the toilet for the next 2 days
Steak is heavy idk if I could eat that in one sitting.
how lol
The lady at the beginning of the video when you walked in sounds pretty rude! I would have turned around and walked right back out. She made it sound like you were a dumbass and should have known better than to ask questions! 😮
I think you needed a better knife! Looks like and acts like cutting with a bread knife.
you don't eat fat! that's cheating
how does one not die eating that much?
This was awesome!
how... seriously how
I’m new to this channel but all the ones I’ve seen I can’t say I’ve seen him hit a wall like he did here. I haven’t come across a fail yet either.
What with the two halves of a tomato? Is that a common side over there? Seems weird. 😂
Just ask for a steak knife next time lol using a butter knife on a big piece of meat was mistake
Don't know why you act like you are struggling, we know the food disappears into the blackhole that is your stomach and ceases to exist anymore.
Norfolk-inn chance steak challenge 😂😂
I can’t believe they didn’t give him a steak knife!! That’s where the fatigue comes from!
You need an electric carving knife not sure if that’s allowed in the rules.
It’s literally impossible to not eat something when watching these videos
You laugh way to much at your own pathetic mouth, it's sad lol
Sharing would be a misteak
Should have given you a proper steak knife
Holy Cow!
They gave him a butter knife lol
What cut of meat was that?
lol after that giant meal they give you such a tiny slice of cake
The baby looked like she got the joke 😂
If only you could drink sulphuric acid and not die to quickly digest all that meat for a better toilet experience
Why are prison inmates walking by you???
Useless Butter Knife and not the best 🥩 cut of meat. Are they making that challenge even more difficult ?
Wow man this one was wild. Good job
But , The fat is the best part !
hey great job! one question though, i saw your other video of chicken fried steak challenge and now this, how are you not super fat? LOL 😅
that looked insanely hard. I need to make a restaurant and create a food challenge that you cant beat
You talk about flavour fatigue, but I’ve noticed you usually eat all of one thing, then all of the next. Why not have a break and eat a few chips and onion rings?
Now I am going to eat a 'baby'
When he finished the steak he didn't have mushroom left
GET A PROPER STEAK KNIFE WTF WTF
I've just discovered your channel and subscribed.  Are you sure that steak was from a cow or a buffalo? Lol  You are awesome. Well done! Your new fan from Oz.  P.S. Any plans on coming to Australia and taking on some of the food challenges down here?
Homer: Must finish steak. Must beat guy I just met.
Try wolverhampton Jacks bar. Indian  mix grill challenge
That would feed me for a week.
Does anyone know if its 100oz with the fat or with out?
Great service!
Fucking Legend 💪
Why you dont eat the sides as you eat the steak ?👀👀
I think it’s the first time I’ve seen him use a knife and fork.
Yes Beard, it's a bed warmer, however you removed it before sleeping in it.
The fat the best thing 😂
I bet your shit was like Mike Tysons neck tha next day!
We'll teach you how to knit! Yeah, Then I'll teach you how to eat up your pension in one sitting! ;)
Awesome love your videos. Brilliant
Those frozen onion rings always depress me
Nothing but impressive lad 👏
Wow, great job. My jaw hurts just watching this 😆
They could have given him an actual steak knife wtf?!
Did I hear the guy say anal haha your face 😂 and every time someone asks for a picture you pull the most hilarious face haha- well done, was the stake cooked to your liking? Med well or? Looked good 👍  smashed it..
my fingers hurt lol.
Damn 😶😶
how you stay fit is beyond me, but grreat sense of humor and charm is verry entertaining
How does his stomach not rupture? It scary.
Dam dude 🤯
That’s the smallest portion of chips I’ve seen so far
Wow well Done .x
Mr beard you should be a comedian man god bless you man. Stay healthy and I wish you good health buddy
NO! The fat of the steak/beef is the best part 😢😋
That steak looked so good 😊😋😋😋
Do you have any where it's super high end steakhouse??? To see if you can tell us if it's really that !much better
I’ve seen pot roasts and briskets that were smaller than that beast, lol.
Bro, I watch all of your videos. Be safe and healthy. Huge respect 👏💪
Dude must have to flush 3 or 4 times per poo session
Had to laugh so hard at 9:00, watching you for almost 3 years, now. So, there's a lot going on when the mushrooms 'might actually taste good' for you. I always enjoy the huge difference in watching you selecting food compared to me. I spare the best parts til the end. But in the end, you never seem to need a sidekick like me. :D
Why save the chips and onion rings until the end they are not going to taste nice by that point. Personally went I am eating stake I eat it with the chips, meaning like I will get some stake on the fork and then some chips to.
Not gonna lie I think cutting it all first would’ve made it a lot easier
I fancy a steak now but it's 4 o'clock in the morning
you said the times wrong it's 1 hour for a solo and 45min for a duo. The guy even told you and you still got it wrong, yikes.
Never really been into sharing though ….. same! 😂😂
Not too far fro me.      I fancy my chances!!! When are you going to have an eat off with paddy pimblet the ufc champ who boast about his appetite…..      we would all lobe to see this!!!!
Should have brought Mrs.Beard and put her in charge of cutting steak and eating mushrooms
they give him too much time.
I know u must get it alot, but what about the morning after 💩?
I gotta know! How often do you get constipated from these food challenges? lol
I am a skinny guy and love food but have been ill for a while.  Watching your videos makes me so hungry I have to eat and watch!  I love it.  That was a monster steak mate.
u kno what, this is the video that gets me to subscribe lol coz man i thought no way could you do it
What a legend
You'd put hot coals into the pan. Then run it between the sheets and the bed to warm it up nice and toasty. Then remove it and go to bed. That way, you're not trying to get comfy surrounded by cold sheets. You don't actually sleep with the pan all night.
i can eat all that in less than 5 mintues
This is beyond impressive!
Dude won't they let you bring your own silverware & a sharper knife.hahaha. your awesome!
I'll bet you couldn't sleep for two days after eating all that steak. That's a lot of protein, good for the gym.
There’s a 5 kg Japanese food challenge I think you would be interested in I can’t remember where it is in Japan it’s okonomiyaki
I hope you leave a good tip for the waitress....
champion.
how does this not kill you??
please don’t have a heart attack bruv, I love your videos man you gotta chill 😭
There’s a burrito challenge back here in measly Texas that I KNOW you couldn’t do lol
No steak knife though?
These restaurant owners and servers were so sweet!! They wanted you to win and cheered you on.  Beautiful people. I'd travel there to be adopted by them.
You should take a really good battery operated knife with you on these kind of challenges
Yeah boy.. I’m a  Norfolk lad. Good on ya.
u just got 2 love the lady in the back round !!! talk about photobombing ! she looks like she could do the food challenge faster than u LOL  !
I love your shoes.
You should have asked for a real knife. That butter knife isn't meant for cutting through 3 inches of cow flesh.
Should’ve asked for a bigger knife, maybe a kitchen knife lol
When you do these steak challenges ask for a carving knife and fork in addition. It’ll cut down on the hand fatigue.
If you ever had a knitting channel I'd expect a bunch of witty banter during the knitting... Yes you have it, Knitting wit
You almost finished in the team limit.
You don't leave the pan of coals in the bed. You run it over the sheets and under the covers(hence the long handle) and then drop it off at the fireplace and quick jump in.
A steak knife would have been nice.
I got the munchies so bad I can eat that in 40 minutes
That tray starting to fold under the weight of that plate is wild.
You got my subscription brother, you are special and I wish you well.
Probably could've used a carving knife
The dessert.  That's the part that is so insane. I can't imagine the digestion of all that food. Beard you're amazing.
Norfolkin chance just about killed me good on ya
The steak looked hard and dry.
what kind of inhuman metabolism are you running on XD. Love the videos, i feel full just watching them at this point. incredibel stuff!
no ads love that !
Great video but u missed a bit
this man need to banned on this whole earth
he eats i put weight on
You should bring someone along when there's an option for 2 and mushrooms are on the menu.
Hahaha the expression on your face at the end with the cake lmao 🤣 congratulations
OK DO U SMOKE ALOT OF POT  UNREAL I JUST CANT FATHOM WHAT U CAN SMASH
Gluttony we really are in the end of days when this is classed as entertainment!
That brass pan is actually an old cooking utensil used for cooking sheep heads. Love the content by the way 🤌
Awesome collab with the knitting society this was 👌😂... that place has really good staff too. All staff should be this friendly and kind.
You nearly beat the time for 2 people to eat that, you are a beast! I mean that in the best way possible.
The fat is the best part though
Beard, Lyndsey (mrs beard) has you spoilt rotten I wish i could travel as much as you do I'd be dead 😂😂 and yes mrs beard cheese and biscuits are the perfect Finnish after dessert obviously lol
Wow, that steak is super well done. Looks super dry.
holy fucking shit fam!!! thats sick bro!!! 100oz yo lol
Eat the fat!😠✊
This must be terrible for that guys health
Hi Beard, firstly I love your content I just wanna point out how bad eating loads of meat is for the environment. Maybe some non-meat based challenges would be a good idea?
It’s a bowl of soup
Bro ate a baby and then asked for dessert what a legend
Always a little surprised that competitive eaters don't have their own untensils.  That knife wasn't cutting it...sorry for the pun.
Jfc your shit must be like a nuclear warhead going off lol
Why not use the sides for flavor fatigue?
Looked like they over cooked that thing to a dry tough piece of leather....
Savage
Why wouldn't they just give you a sharp steak knife?
BBQ sauce on a steak? I'm shocked they accommodated you for such an insulting request.
You’re a monster. That cow never stood a chance.
Have you ever thought about live streaming these?
Awesome video . Fn dessert after was killer! 😅
Places like this that serve whole ass tomatoes as food like what the fuck
Yer feckin nuts man, I love you! How the hell do you do it? Do you throw up? How do you shit in the morning? Do you starve yourself or line your stomach? Whats the vitamin gain ratio to calorific intake? Does protein count or do you just get spots....? Do you eat once a week or only on Sundays..? MACHINE!!! Great entertainment mate, respect ;-)
Your Jaw will be mega strong after this challenge Mr Beard.
Anyone else has "The Great Outdoors" vibes when he asked do you have to eat the rind of fat. . .
why didn't they give you a serrated stake knife? it looks like you're using a butter knife.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 🍰🍰🥇🥇🥇🥇✨✨
Mate, ever thought about bringing your own knife? 😂
His beard is gross
In all seriousness, how do you not rupture your stomach? This is INSANE!😀
Nice hosts but they need to provide a proper steak knife for this bad boy
aww was hoping sister beard would have joined you :)
Wow 😳 dude just ate that dude has black hole for stomach🤣
I once ate a 60 oz steak, with no sides an didn’t eat for the next 36 hrs
How is that physically possible?
You’re a SAVAGE!
His jaw had to have hurt after that
Mad man, after the cow and a field of veggie, onion rings and mushrooms, you had dessert 🤣❤️🤣❤️
That crispy fat easily looked like the best part to me!
You"ve never been into sharin (Sharron), I hope not remember Mrs.Beard's first name is Mrs! LOL
Chutzpah ! For a minute I thought we were in Brooklyn, well said.  L'chaim !
💕🔥👍
Impressive steak
Doesn't even touch the steak sauce
Why is this man eating a 100oz steak with a damn butter knife?
No!!!!!!!! You have to eat the fat too
Now that's a steak!
That cut looks like a roast more than a steak
Narrator: "and having completed the feat, he felt a tinge of sadness, knowing that he would never poop again"
I’d love to eat that, I’d eat the fat too
This man must have an impressive x-ray...
My relatives come from Swaffham - so spent many a day in the White Heart
so friendly bloke, its great. and you're literally eating a full 9 month grown big ass baby in weight
Whooo!! They serve dogs as Asian I am intrigued to go there
the big strip of fat on the end is literally the best part how can you call yourself a foodie
I can only imagine this guys shits
Textiles, socialist knowing of hand craft is Morris, and his bourgious  care art from, slum slave abuse of our care producers and abject greed not only class snobery but today!s modern capitalist usery and further abuse,the true producers the working class..
At least the meal hasn’t have a shit load of potato chips. Go hard Beard 🧔‍♀️
You the man how do you it? Thank for sharing!
Way to give you a butter knife instead of a sharp steak knife lol
That is way overcooked.....I think that would be the harder part for me is eating a dry, well done steak...
Amaze'n 🤪👏👏👏👏
Over cooked as fuck
The Ole Meat Sweats
These people gave you a butter knife to cut a 3kg steak? Surely thats on purpose to slow you down to they dont have to lose the money. Theres no way a steak house gives patrons butter knives for a steak.
This man is the goat 🐐
How? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That’s awesome
@8:40 'I have never heard two people debate textiles so vociferously.' - REALLY? vociferously? I agree, but also, I can't say I have ever heard a youtuber use that word.
Get yourself an electric knife buddy ...and possibly a new colon
I’ll take that fat! Fuck the meat lol
Shes got that prissy attitude like.. fuck beard is here. Looks like I’m giving food away today! Lmao
1:22 How does that make sense bro? Solo gets 60 minutes and duo 45? Duo should get 30 minutes obviously
Why would someone put a dog picture on their food menu what a stupid idea
You'll be giving birth to something later after eating all that haha
He definitely knitted a bib in half the time as those professional knitters behind him.
Dood if he had another person that thing would've been done in 20 minutes. lol legend..
New to the channel but u have charisma   Just subscribed
6 pounds 4 ounces, that's like eating a newborn baby... plus sides. I want my baby back baby back baby back... ribs.
You should do commercials for Badger...they make garbage disposals.👍
You talk to much just eat !
There’s a 200oz steak challenge down by me in South Devon 😅
I'm just looking at the butter knife trying to cut a steak  .
You missed a piece
I love the Fat, I would attempt to eat that too. I cook brisket untrimmed and cut of slabs to eat untrimmed.
The fact you didn’t get a steak knife
Who ate all the what now? Lol
half the challenge is having to cut a 100oz steak with a butter knife.
you have an awesome personality. i would have loved to meet you in ottawa!
Houuutzzpaaa
you'll eat mushrooms but not a baby... you might have found something you can't stomach more than shrooms.
Why is there never anybody at the restaurants you go to?
Get in my belly, he thinks looking at the baby
whats the cream about that they put on the cake?
If that's a steak ,🤔 how darn big was the cow?😁
Unbelievable  !!!
Why the fuck would u say that about the baby,,,,uffft stop watching ur channel,,,,, that’s satanic words omg
Do you chew your food or just chomp and swallow lol and what's your work out look like lol
I am recommending this video to my every vegetarian friends.
That steak is ridiculous but looks good 😋
Got me when you said "I've never been one for sharing" ..... very funny
Imagine the chock if Mr Beard would have, instead of asking for a dessert, he would have asked the gentle ladies if he could have joined them in their knitting.
Not only did he do it solo but he even did it in the time duos have to do it in. Impressive
Real facts.🔥🔥🔥🔥
Always wondered how much of an impact eating that much does to the body. And must be a genetic component to being able to endure filling ur insides with way more than the body needs or wants in fact it's so difficult to even keep chewing ur jaw will lock. I could never do that I'm talking if someone said I'll give u a hundred mill I couldn't do it like physically impossible for myself yet beardy man here ain't even a big fella and he does this. His stomach must be stretched to the max after that all his tubes and intestines  colon the works must all be full. Must feel so sleepy after these challenges if not he's a freak or marvel depending which way u look at it. Can u imagine if his body got so used to it that if he stopped doing challenges he would look like a skeleton.  Hope not for his sake. But don't know he's obviously doing well with what he's doing just don't know if it's the best thing to do. Very glotenous don't know why I'm shocked when he finishes once u know he can eat like that it's hard to doubt him
you maniac
random questions:  does heart disease ever become a worry for you? like wouldn't eating so much red meat have a serious toll on your body? what do you do after eating this? sleep? fast for a few days?
ah wheres the steak knife lols mightve helped yikes was painful watching you cutt it :)
Bring your own knife nextime lad!
Well done, Mate!!
They might have been friendly but that dull knife they gave you is pure evil.
You didn’t sleep with the bedpan. It was just used to warm the bed before you got in
You amaze me over and over with your videos! You are a Legend Mr. Bearded Man!
Your jaw must hurt so much after chewing all that beef. Seeing Beard knock-out these massive challenges like it's nothing is so impressive. Also, good show by the owners and staff for being so accommodating and friendly.
sus @5:23
Just started watching your videos today. You're a beast love your videos.
Reckon you'd well share Lindsay for a pizza
Aww, the fat on the ends are the best part 😔😔
Erm...hello....steak knife? What kind of berry from the dingle serves you a steak that size with a blunt butter knife. I'm surprised you did as well as you did tbh mate. Another great video btw loved it 👍🏻
Beardlings 😆👍🏻 The kiddie winkles will love that. Pretty sure you've inspired many a beard growing attempt amongst the men of today and the boys who will be the men of tomorrow. Inspiring. (Not for me though I'm one of those weirdos with brown hair but for some unjust reason a ginger/blonde beard....its just wrong. I think if my beard matched my hair colour I'd give it a grow but as it is I'd look ridiculous.
Slide in on a dinosaur
yabadabadoo
Amazing beard
Matilda
Third video in i subbed at the big ass burger with the paddling, then I see you nail that bigg ass pizza, now this 100oz steak, you sir are a beast, I salute you sir 😃.
Thank your stars it wasn't a baby in that warming pan!Come on,keep up!!!
Seems like a real nice pub
I've got to ask mate, what are your shites like in the morning after this lmao?
NASTY STEAK....COOKED HORRIBLY
loose me with the mushrooms... so GROSS. LOL
That was amazing! I'm a pretty big guy, but even I would have trouble finishing all that. It looked SO GOOD too!
“Greetings Beardlings”… me:OMG I’m a Beardling!   Love it.  Great video as always Beard! 👍😃
Was stupid to use cutlery in the first place. Hands are best
Can't even imagine!
at least they should give you a proper knife to cut this beast.
HOW DARE YOU leave the fat!!! the best bit!
That steak looks bloody magnificent.
Beard, you never cease to amaze me.  You're the best eater out there and by far the best personality.  Hilarious and a beast.  Unreal! Cheers from Canada!
Ticking over nicely.
Well excited to actually try this but it’s a rump and rumps are so boring and tough 😅
Big set of scissors would make it way easier
I would call that a roast, not a steak.
Wouldn't be so bad if that thing had any juice left in it. It's soooo overcooked!!!
I could be your 2nd man eating just mushrooms🤠
Why Diet Coke
wish i lived in England so i could go here, place looks awesome and the staff seem dope
I am 3 times the size of this guy, and can't come close to eating what he does. I gain 20 pounds watching him. Does he puke it after?
Didn’t your mother teach you to share!😁
Steak looks rank
Where’s the steak knife?
This guy must have his plumber on speed dial
Didnt HAVE to eat the fat?! Thats the best part! I would have rather eaten the fat and left the meat!
You could have done with a proper steak knife, looks epic though
You could have made a fat bastard joke there and said I ATE A BABY
Why didn’t you get an actual steak knife? That one looks like a butter knife. No wonder your hands hurt!
maybe i'm just a bit ferral but i would totally demolish that fat it's my fave bit!!!
You’re an absolute IDOL! That piece of meat alone looked like if would feed 4-6 people! And the dessert at the end, just WOW!!
This guy must actually break toilets across the UK and further afield
Fantastic 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✅✅✅✅✅
That sounded like wank heart... Bad ears
Looks over cooked
Steak looks over done
should have asked for a sharper knife.
The pan, behind you, is called a bed warmer.
Yes, that does appear to be a bedwarmer, and, they didn't put blazing hot coals in them, they frequently used nearly dead bits of glowing log, so just warm enough to heat the bed, and then likely to burn out shortly.
man u are just a beast, im gonna do another 2 challenges at mccowans on friday  - 32 oz steak fondue and maybe di tge macxcalibre one.  i'll se your tactics as help
Those poor folk using food banks ☹️☹️
You wolved it down like a pro !
Woow   What a brilliant video 📷📷📷
That's a roast...looks pretty good
Mouth of that dude is a black hole!
This guy is going to develop gout at a young age...
Hahaha his jaw was hurting chewing that cake
I WANT THE FAT PART!!!! DANG JUST WASTED IT 🤣
im a vegan .. and its disqusting to me that an animal had to die for this nonsense! that a human can proves that he can eat a absurd mountain of meat!
His legs an feet put me off my KFC
Why did they give you a butter knife?
What is the Norfolk Enchanted Reference?
Beard you are a BEAST !!!! From Canada
why not eat with your hands, at least the steak haha?
God,my stomach was hurting watching this.For the first time though,I have seen you doing it pretty easily in other videos
am i the only person who claps after he completes each challenge ? haha
Half the challenge is the fact they give you a butter knife to cut the steak.
That’s a roast for a family of 7.
No steak knife. 😂 they seriously didn’t want you to win.
Adam is the best food challenge yter hands down, best personality, best food places... although I'll never forget /that/ kebab challenge, the one in the pizza box. That was the one time I felt you went too far and I was worried for you lol.
Starts when you cut into it. Pick it up and eat it with your hands... 🤷‍♂️
I struggled to finish the video!
You recently came to Copperas Cove, Texas and now Gatesville, Texas has a challenge at Studebakers pizza a 28' pizza $59 if you fail within an hour.
is that a butter knife??
Did they give you a proper steak knife (which should cut like a razor)  or on of the pretend ones with serrations like a little saw? Those rip the meat rather than slice making it dryer?
Seems like a really awesome group of staff at this place
GOOD LUCK MATE!!!
I feel like he smashes anything with meat... its chips that  kill him off.
Seems quite reasonable in that they didn’t load up the chips to bulk up but snide they didn’t give him a steak knife. Cutting with a regular dining knife is definitely more of a challenge…
Fun fact that thing on the wall beside you is a thing used for putting hot coals in your bed back in the day.
I can only imagine the destructive nature of this man's absolute thunderous dooties!
Great work. Steak looks dry as hell though
you've accomplished th....
How is this physically possible
Man, you must have been locked up the next day after that!
I haven't seen anyone mention he's knife, it's not a steak one.. well....
An absolute beast!
Steak for two for one!
This guy is a eating machine! Lol
Hey mate rather have the cake at the end rather then the main meal
Damn.. with that jaw strength from that steak Mrs Beard is going to be very happy when you eat her out mate.
Smallest amount of chips I ever saw in a food challenge.
you should definitely do the challenges that Randy and his wife has recently done on there visit these ways.
it's the same size as you..... but i won't eat you i draw the lines at babies lmao 🤣
How many hemorrhoids you got?😂 nice job!👏
Is it weird to watch a grown man eat a steak challenge meant for 2, with all those sides, and the only thing you get kinda offput by was seeing him put cream on his cake? I think my priorities are a bit out of whack.
I wish they gave you proper cutlery for the steak
It's a shame that someone hasn't invented a Steak knife 🤔
WOW   That was HUGE..  Great job
I gotta say that was a reasonable amount of chips, for a change.
Should call the series..... ANIMAL ADAM !!! LOL
Yooo Beard, random question but what are thoose shoes you had in this vid please? They are amaziing, thanks :D
Well done Adam. Regards watching your videos, I'm a newbie, You tube just put your vids on my home page. Glad it did as I am enjoying them.
Dude I’m impressed
My God I loved this so much. Great job as always Mr. Beard.
That chocolate cake with cream got me.  One thing we haven't figured out here in the US is how good cream is as a topping on things like chocolate cake.  My Step father turned me on to this and I've always wondered why the hell this isn't a common thing here in the states?  I mean, whipped cream is relatively common.....but simple heavy cream is a divine topping for cakes (among other things)
Eating all that crep you won't live long lol
more surprised you used utensils
Is it 45 mins or an hour 😭
You don't have to eat the fatslabs, but they are delicious.
He always asks for sugary dessert after a savoury challenge to help balance out his taste buds.
Check his beard..he hiding foods in there 😅😅🤣
My jaw is sore just watching this
You could have managed the fat too.
Why not in future!!! Try an electric carving knife??? 🤔🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂😂
The challenge starts when you cut the steak. Eat the stake later. Extra time!   Thanks for all the fun.     Jerry
It would be funny if someone yelled fat a$$ after 😂. Congrats!
so that bed warmer thing, you dont sleep next to it. what they do is run it over the sheets and under the blankets to warm the bed so its not cold when you jump in it. good job smashing that challenge
Looks like it was meant for 5 people. I would have to see it in real life to believe it. His videos are not raw videos, meaning, its been tapered, such as, they have been cut or split, or spliced, sped-up in time and etc.   ...the list goes on.  I've seen many of his videos, and he should weigh about 2,000 lbs now and be dead already. Someone who can really eat that much, would look pregnant. Sometimes, he ask for a dessert, after he wins - hmm? It's not like this guy is on the News anywhere.
That is a giant steak!!!!!!!
100 ounces = 6.26 US Pounds.  God, three days worth of food
Ridiculous that was way too easy I mean I can almost do that but I love watching you eat for some reason
Ive seen like a hundred of your challenges so far and the huge rind of fat at the front of the camera really takes away from all the steak you eat behind it.  Food for thought for the future.  Great vid as always though!
Ask for a sharp knife 😂
They should’ve given you a proper steak knife!
Knife is small for the steak you need a samurai sword
The sheer size of this guys turds must be rediculous
Teams of two is mrs Beard and Beardmeatsfood !! She’s the coach
100 oz steak solo is amazing 👏🏻 😋  This guy is a beast!  Had the cheek to have puddin.  🤣
I have no idea how you do it. I applaud you, sir.
The steak was 6.25 lbs alone, amazing he could eat it
I have watched a lot of Food Competitive eaters but King Beard seems to be one of the best that is like a magnet, he’s entertaining and quite funny too!
What a dope little spot
There once was a man from Swaffham who took his bolloks out to wash em,his wife said Jack put them back or I will stand on the bastards and squashem
What a cool chap with a nice beard.Chap.
my bad bro i went to press share and i accidentally clicked dislike but i undisliked and liked it. love these videos bro
Cutting that thing up is a challenge in itself
My Jaw is aching watching you 😩,  honestly it is , but we'll done anyway . Awesome 👌
How long did it take to cook that thing?
Whoa that's a crazy amount of meat for one man
John Candy had to eat his gristle for The Old 96er......just saying.
Go Captain CaveMan
we Donte need a pic but mate you must shit bricks in de morning :D
Ur stomach 😑
Why does everyone serve mushrooms...
norfolk represent!
Does your toilet flush?
Instead of asking for dessert you should have asked "can I eat the child now?"
The crime here is that they gave you a butter knife for a steak that size.
I am surprised they gave you such a small knife 🍴😂
Eating using hands is always the easiest and best, for it's just natural.
I just don’t understand how you ate a piece of meat the same size as your chest
Your unreal 👍
When he started narrating, he got the times so wrong. But good job
TIMER STARTS WHEN YOU CUT INTO THE STEAK - why'd you not eat the sides first?
I’d be no good with such a challenge. I go for the fatty parts. That’s where the real flavour dwells.😎🇨🇦
I can't stop watching these videos. hahaha
"MEANT FOR TWO" boi that steak feeds 10 people
I'm confused. I thought someone said at the beginning it's 45min for a pair, or 60mins solo. But then once you start you say it's 30mins team of 2 and 45mins solo... 🤔
I like the fact that these videos are never over the top with energy. Just chill and cool vibes, with polite commentary. Cheers!
*upcloseface* : *smack *smack *smack..."that's nice"
You need to bring your own razor sharp knife to these things.
What an animal!
Barbecue sauce? What happened to Worcestershire sauce, Mr. Brit?! 😆
Yummy!
Firstly, they need to provide a proper steak knife or a electric knife.. secondly, did you get asked how you like your steak? Cause I could eat that but it would definitely need to be medium 🥩 that looked way overdone for my liking! loved the knitting group 😄
FAKE CAMERA ANGLES SHOW THE FOOD GREATER THEN REALITY
Eat the fat, yummy, you've plenty of time Mr Beard lol
You should  at least trim your mustache  alittle you must eat a lot of your hair.
Just an aside Adam, you don't sleep with the can of ashes, you use it to take the chill off the sheets before you get in.
Start putting locations n you will 100% have a fan club turning up. Top man 👍
Every time you say Chips I’m always 😳 where are the chips ? I can’t find them 😂
Damn I wish I have a skill like you, I. Will have no problem for food till I'm in the age when I cannot do a challenge like this...imagine just finding a food challenge restaurant and have a free food.
what a monster of a man!
That was some watery cream
unless I am remembering wrong, the worker dude said 3 pairs had succeeded and that pairs got 45 min while solo got 1h. while the voice over said 4 winner and 30/45 respectively.
could you guys imagine if this guy smoked some pot then did this, he would def eat at least 10 horses
Why does it seem like every single food challenge he does in the UK has a boat of mushrooms regardless of what type of food challenge it is? Do Brits eat mushrooms with every meal?
what  doesn t count  you left the best on the table man
Serious questions how are you able to eat so much but i always see you looking the same
You don't keep it in the bed with you. You just put it under the blanket and move it around too warm up the bed
Do they not have steak knives in England?
Insane!  Nice Show!
He’s a beast
Should have brought a better knife with you… oh wait can only do that in MURICA!
Whats the bill on that steak if you don’t finish ?
You can feed 8 starved individuals for this. Sorry, it’s disgusting. I hope there’s some sort of charity where starving people are able to eat what you do
I think I could manage the chip portion.
You got one hour solo and 45 min duo
Impressive!
don't know how you do it my friend. mom hates beards- but she loves me and I have one- and I got her to join your club too
These owners are so nice
That was just awesome
Places that don't wave the bill for finishing their challenge should not offer the challenge.
I could do this one with my cousin easy.
Did they change the time on you? They started out saying you had 45 min....but it seemed like they were allotting an hour...I mean, you got it either way...
I’m a brand new subscriber. From the US. I would love to do a challenge with you someday. We’ve got plenty in texas and other states as well!
If they Chard that fat a bunch I'd eat it as well 🤙
Ur my age exactly buddy u have found ur bag no doubt good on you!
I'd watch you try to knit
Love the videos as always beard! 💪🙏
You absolutely disgust me. I wish you well, though
I hope you have regular physicals.
"People say I never do collabs" hahaha
I buy my dog steaks but she turns her nose up at them if I don't cook it just right.
they should give you at least a better steak knife , it looked like a butter knife
Wow that steak is massive!
Working in flipflops or whatever they are would put me off completely. What a 💩hole
There's always room for dessert
Imagine dropping an 100 oz 🪵 the next day...
talk about colon cancer and only 10% of that food maybe that is actually digested!
How.. that thing was as big as his torso?
I feel like they should have given you better knife.
Swaffam was the place i did my CBT, i'm glad to see its garnishing some attention cos its a lovely little place 😁
Calling all British, is the restaurant landlord the same thing as a manager?
Is it just me or does one of those guys in the restaurant sound a lot like Patches from, Souls?
"Never really been into sharing" lol
has he ever lost a challenge?
Other than the tomatoes.. Totally doable.
I eat an 8oz steak meal and my jaw aches……god knows how the hell you didn’t get lock jaw
i really wonder where you put it all sometimes haha
2:18 Norfolk Inn chance steak challenge 🤣 🤣 that was gold 🤣 🤣
mmmm that fat looks good.  I couldn't imagine not eating it. The best part.
I would visit Norfolk just for that. Looks great!
Most incredible feat may be that you did this with a butter knife!
can they give this man a better knife to cut this with? just started the video, his hand is gonna cramp before his jaw with that little thing.
Nice job, that meat was way too over cooked…
I respect what you or anyone who do this....but just to get a free meal..it sucks...I know you make money somehow but... to helk with making money that way....I'll see if you be here at 50
They made you work too hard 😐 atleast they could had given a butcher's knife
Horrible looking “steak”
All those food goes to his beard.
Wow. That steak looks tougher then what I've ever seen. You can hardly cut it.
If the meat was getting boring why didn't eat any chips or mushrooms I didn't enjoy this act of gluttony
good lord i would imagine you sleep on the couch after something like this to keep you wife out of the blast zone
Your awesome brother cheers from Texada island Canada
God you’re so nice, lettin those ladies sit there.
Asking for "lubricant" while cutting off and discarding the fat cap, which is 100% lubricant. lol
These guy most be a menace on a toilet. Like an athom bomb test site or something.
id like to get a lipid panel on this bloke
I feel like you smell like a goat in real life. Which honestly sounds badass seeing as how you are the g.o.a.t.
I got an upset stomach and diarrhea just watching the video.
Greetings beardlings Lmfao *touches beardless chin*
That steak looks dry AF
Ridiculous a steak that size and not even a steak knife 😂 poor effort by the restaurant...
This somehow looks smaller than the 76oz 🤔
So to do the challenge solo you have to eat double the food, but only get a third extra time.
How the hell does someone have a plate of mushrooms but doesn’t have one on his fork for the entire 100 ounce steak inhuman
Not that you don't enjoy the challenge meals (and that steak looks (erm...looked) magnificent, but what do you have when you and Mrs Beard are just enjoying a nice quiet (non-challenge) meal?
How do you eat that much food seriously I want to know?
Does he just vomit it out after he did it? Most competitive eaters do as far as I know.
HOW, I shit myself after a bacon king... This man can just casually eat a mid sized dog
Maybe you can repeat it with sheep ... as a colab with wool ladies.
Give the poor man a sharp knife.
A lot of this food looks amazing... but the tempo you eat it in would make it hard for me to enjoy it - even if I could handle the amount. This is 10 times the amount of meat I've ever had in 1 sitting.
incredible mate 🤘🏼
how the fak?
They legit gave you a butter knife thats disrespectful
Can I see the desert menu haha. How about a joint video with Rate My Takeaway?
That is so thick, there is no way to cook that much meat the same throughout. So you have these massive well-done chunks around the outside. It looks so dry and unappetizing bro, there is no way. I would be drenching in that sauce, good call to eat half without sauce up front.
4:25 French Fries and Arugula, thank you very much
It’s asinine that they don’t provide you with a proper steak knife.
I would mix the steak w my mushrooms, I can’t stand mushrooms by themselves
10:36 the 🤨 killed me. subbed
What did they say about the fat trimmings?  Did they say you didn't pass the challenge but they'd give you the meal free? I couldn't hear over all of the clapping.
This man must shit like a grizzly bear before hibernation
hahaha cutting steak with a butter knife.  come on bro....
I want to watch a reaction video with Vegans watching this man eat.
WTF man   ea of these meals cost you  more then the challenge price when you have to get your stomach  pumped
So much food wasted,human body doesnt need so much food,i think its not worth someone eat so much just for a show,i think this guy would be better if he could share all this food.
That's more like roast beef rather than proper steak. 😂
while the video time-lapse going the timer goes normal speed
im surprised people cant figure out how to not gain weight and still do food challenges lol.
The fats the best part
I'm suprised you can drink the soda with that, bloatville.
How can ya not like the fat on a steak??? Its full of yummy deliciousness, well done on that challenge,
Your absolutely mental bro 😎 fair play to ya
a menu for dogs thats so cool even tho its a little detail
i'm not into food channels, but you are unique lol
Is that even a proper steak knife?
They gave this bro a fucking butter knife to cut the steak....
You didn't leave a warming pan in your bed! You took it out before you got in.
Young Man You are making it happen.  Nothing but love for you.  🥰🥰🥰
9:15 your poops must be spectacular!
Wow. Impressive!!👍
Du u vomit it all after the challenge?
And here I thought it was unrealistic when John Candy's character ate the Old 96'er in The Great Outdoors - but now we've seen it done in real life.
As soon as when the man says no one has done it alone but 3/4 out of 50 have done it but non alone, right as Mr Beardy says I’ll have a go at it right then I knew Mr Beardy is gonna wipe it clean, I have two things to say one mr beardy can stand face to face to a challenge and two I have absolutely no doubt where theirs a reasonably big record to make its gona be made and of theirs a record to break its gonna be broken especially in America, I can hand on heart say this man is nothing but a eating machine and then when you bear in mind his stature your left gobsmacked it’s that  simple!!!!!
This is the first challenge I would attempt.
that beard and those mustaches are disgusting
This looks like a fun one.
Unfreaking believable
I remember the knitting ladies so I've seen this before
You need a steak knife not a butter knife 🔪🗡️
Thats a great way to deal with a snorer " I need to go away for a few days " .
That was so cool!
You’re a beast bro 😎
You are a beast. It can’t be good for your over all health.
If you feel a tingling in your left arm, it just means that you haven't eaten enough.
Good lord that thing is cooked like shoe leather.
They said pairs are 45 minutes and solo is 60 but you said pair is 30 minutes and solo is 45 minutes, just an FYI
full on meat sweats
They britished that meat it look dead
I love the women in the background ❤
That doesnt even look that big, i easily polished a 48 ounce on my birthday without straining. Seems doable with alot  of water.
2.8Kg of steak...what the ****.....
You are the perfect example of what I refer to as being "Relentlessly You". People aren't genuine enough. Those that are, command more respect and likeness from those around. Becoming Relentlessly Yourself is key. Love the vids!
I enjoy parts of the fat cap, especially in cuts like picaña or punta trasera and solomo (those last two being Venezuelan names for cuts). But damn, imagine having to eat all that fat as part of the challenge hahaha. Good thing it's not the case
That's a thousand calories of fat left on the side
How many courics is the aftermath mate?
oO
Is it just me or did the time limit get changed within the same minute?   First the guy said as a solo you get 60 min and a pair 45 min, then BeardMeatsFood commentary says you get 30 min as a pair and 45 as a solo.
"dont mind me im just being a professional pig" lmao
If it wasn’t for the fact that it’s a challenge I would totally judge you for using barbecue sauce.
Could u imagine if he went into n all you can eat buffet the ones where they charge you something like £15 n u can eat as much as you want.they would definitely ban him after he ate all that was on offer.
A steak is never a misteak
didn't he say 60 mins if solo?
BTW, you (or your staff) would remove the bedwarmer before you actually go to bed
i know this abit late but know wonder your arm is falling off Adam you was using a butter knife aha lol love the vids keep it up man
in all seriousness isn’t there some serious health issues involved with doing this type of thing all the time
2.83kg of meat alone roflmao sh1t thats alot
the fat is where the flavor is Bud
Good video to send to your vegan acquaintances
Did it in the time limit for 2 people and took time to chat with people during the challenge. Legendary.
lol I didnt even think about how tired your arm would get having to cut pieces off.
Great video. Please make the music softer in other videos
Do you go out and hurl after?   I dont see where you put it all.
Yes that's a bed warmer. It was put in bed before sleep and removed before u entered bed
Wow that's half a cow lol, impressive 👏
No one’s put a horse in front of you yet !
Wouldn’t olive oil be healthier than BBQ sauce to help it go down ?
Если бы жир с края не срезал, то точно не съел бы
damn impressive
As soon as you picked up the dog menu i decided I officially love this place
You are my hero, Beard.
This man must be giving birth every week.
came because i saw a huge steak, stayed for the street fighter 2 continue sound closer
Eating with your hands shouldnt be called “caveman” :)
pork out queen. nice job, girlfriend!
Looks special
how does it makes sense 2 people 1 hour 1 person 45 min, why not half n hour? cuz that makes mathematicaly way more sense, ooh well cuz the amount is probably the same so you get some extra time i geus if your alone
Are the desserts free?
Everyone is impressed but then he ask for dessert…..then they can’t believe it.
Idk how people do this it’s so crazy I cant breath right when I’m too full and the food just starts coming back up and I don’t eat even close to these guys
can only imagine how big your dumps are
I'd have named it the Hart Attack Challenge. lol
Have you ever not been able to eat it all? Going through your videos just to find it, but no dice I guess.
Hard jobb
who fucked up that meat?! It´s totally overdone!
Here in Kenya there is a person who can eat it with 5 min i bet you
A gotdamn animal, I thought you wasn’t go complete it. Congrats
I imagine a better steak knife would have made it a bit easier but maybe that's just part of the challenge
Near My home village yay 😀
this is like the new man vs food
WT actual F bruv!  Where does it go?  Love this channel.  Never ceases to amaze me.  Did you spend the next 18 hours complaining like a pregnant woman?   I’ve got 3 kids so I hope she don’t see this!
I admire you and your channel-it is most entertaining and you're an amiable guy but you do make far too much fuss about your beard; can't you get some kind of beard net to eat or just accept that a messy-foody beard is inevitable if you're undertaking such formidable challenges. Subbed
I’ve been thinking no one could touch this guy but then I remember double dating at the end of high school dude at a 76oz steak then finished his dates my date’s and even my unfinished 36oz then went out and partied all night.
Jesus that can’t be healthy
Your hilarious man love the vids!! Food looks so good but way to much for me for sure..
why does every challenge come with mushrooms.
How do people do this??? Dont you have to puke or just cant fit anything more in?? It dont make sense to me
Gotta have that diet coke, ya dont want to get fat!
Holly Mackeral! This is not humanly possible.
Good heavens man, I wouldn't want to have a long elevator ride wit ya 12-16 hours after a challenge like this.
That's a Sunday roast.  Is tapeworm cheating?
They might not be strict but this was a fail.  Should have got that fat down ya
imagine if you just asked for a chefs knife
A 100oz well-done steak? shit.
I'm glad you said it first, you must be Dyno-Rods best customer.
Is he the best there is atm?
thats literally one week worth of food for me
I’m imagining the following food coma or walk back to the hotel room… sorry, the elevator is broken, stairs are over there 😅
adam should knit a beard-bib.
Man that looks dry.
average
I think I could eat that witth a partner, though not in 30 minutes.
I just watched 5 of these and I had to subscribe 😂
Dude you should come in armed with a mini electric carver for these 🤷🏻‍♂️
Dare say the pudding feels good at the end because all the sugar helps against the something-or-other that takes place at the end of a meal: the reason why puddings are eaten always at the end. Jolly good he drinks diet coke, I mean, otherwise, it would be a real health hazard.
with half the world starving it seems obscene to publish this series.
damn, you must carry your stomach in a backpack o.O
Was gonna say the fat would just make you sick trying to eat that
Mate.....I bet your Mom was glad when you left home😆,..incredible and a pudding to follow!! .How long does it take you to get through a drive thru?.😉
overcooked steak? 😅
I wonder if they charge him for the drinks and dessert
this reminds me an old tom&jerry cartoons 🥩
I’m new to your channel, but I love it. If you’re ever in the East Yorkshire area for a challenge, I shall come out to support you. All the best, Adam.
11:35 Freeze frame  "That's nice"  *Morgan freeman* "That was a lie. After eating an infants worth of steak It was infact, not that nice"
How can your butt take that much pain when it’s time to go to the bathroom
mate that steak looks tough as a motherfucker
11:34, I can see the suffering in your eyes. You don't need to eat dessert if you don't want to.
for a moment I wondered where the steak knife was then I remembered you'll get fined for as little as nail clippers in the UK  YOU GOT A LOISONCE FOR THAT, MAAAATEEEE?  Atleast we gave you a steak knife in Tejas, lad.
oh my god that's the cutest little baby heeheheeh.
What. No Alan Partridge jokes. Seriously internet. I am dissapoint.
No seriously, you totally can't ask for a dessert! You're not human.
Seriously...they did you wrong by not giving you a sharp knife.  Shouldn't have to saw at it
Damn, and that is not the easiest cut to eat. What is your secret? Do you run a marathon every morning?
This seems dangerous
Would love to watch you shit it all out.
Even got a round of applause from the knitting association, what an honour 😂😂
Amazing
You'll have us believe you actually digest all this and send it on it's way the next morning without taking in any of the calories? Do you have a thyroid problem or something? cause this isn't normal man. Here I struggle not to gain weight while eating like 2 whole wheat sandwiches plus some fruit working in construction. I eat a little portion of supper and that's it but if I have a week I eat just a little more I gain a couple of kg and it takes me a few weeks to loose them. Just doesn't sound fair
John Candy had to eat that fat and gristle. But it was only 96 ounces.
Wow just wow man
What a nice piece of meat *thumbsup*
Uncle Buck would be proud
You're some monster if you don't eat the fat.
Wow. Damn! Incredible job :D
Disappointed that you left the fat. Epic Fail!
"in Swaffham" *Harry hill intensifies*
that foods looks rly good - too much meat for me - but apart from the size that meal looks awesome.
Hyperuricaemia danger zone :D
pro tip : bring a super sharp knife with you next time ;)
HOW
All that steak and not a steak knife to cut it with 🤣🤣 no wonder your arms were dead haha
🤣 beardlings
You'd have to pay me to NOT eat the fat on a steak, mate.
Looks likes the lady in the back already had hers
You're getting to the point that you will need work gloves to do these steak challenges.
my dog gets steak when we go to restaurants, she prefers medium rare Fiorentina (from tuscany) ... we usually share a 2kg cut.
This reminds me of the episode of the Simpsons where Homer competes against Red Barclay in the "Sir Loin-A-Lot" 16lb steak challenge.
Wish you maybe talk about the flavors and such for your commentary. I am always interested in how these food places stack up to a pro eater.
The fat tastes the best and easy to slice.
God's County Norfolk. The best big land mass and small population... but we're being took over!
Little finger
Can you add a timer in the video's?
Quite simply put, Adam... You always come across as such a nice guy. And your videos always make me feel hungry. Best regards
Like a scene from Uncle Buck 🥰
The reaction for dessert never gets old
You don't LEAVE the pan in the bed all night.  You move it around to warm the sheets before you crawl in.  Silly Beard. :)
How in the world did u eat all that??
Pure Western decadency
The fat is the nicest bit, shame to waste it
that babys face when you talked about her being the same size as that serving, lol
Not human Your're  a shaved bear........ Impossible.....I seen it but still don't believe it , you are a  monster 👍
I think everything on this channel is fake
The first and only time ive eaten a large meal like that was 1.5 years ago when i ate a 1kg hamburger with fries and a milkshake. was constipated for 5-6 days after that though. I wonder how he must feel after this meal.
wtf does he say at the start
Get this man a real steak knife. They did you dirty
The fat looked delicious!!
Why not make your videos 2-3 mins longer and take us on a little tour of the restaurants you are eating at and have a little longer chat with the people there and about the history of the places? May be give it a thought. I for one would very much appreciate it and I am sure many more would too, including many owners of those places.
how does it fit inside your body
He doesn't know what a potato wedge is
Your food bill must be relatively  reasonable considering you get yours free and probably keeps you full for 3 days. LOL
I'm not sure I could ask someone if I can take a photo whilst they have a camera facing them...
So funny that they gave you a butter knife to cut a 100 oz steak lol
why don’t you use your own knife/fork?
knitting association is a bunch of lovely ladies
I wonder if he has that toilet that can flush like 18 golf balls?
Yeah, the steak is 100 ounces, 76 oz. of steak and 2 lbs. of fat!
I love steak but it's gross when the chef leaves that much fat on it, get a chef that knows how to trim meat!
nice  job !
That picture on your phone at the start of the video is mè lol that steak was sooo good 👍🏻
They should’ve given you a bigger knife 😂
my mouth is ready
I struggle with a 30oz 😅
This is repulsive content and wrong on all levels. And the appearance of "education advertising" is twisted and makes your existence even more absurd.
Damn has this guy got an extra stomach for extra storage? Wow what a mean feat. Well done
the day i dont eat the fat on a steak is the day im no longer alive, thats the best part!
Bro I bet I can finish it in 10 minutes BC I wouldn't want to give my brother any
and then you become a shit factory. you produce may be 40 or 50 kilos by day . respect man!
i wonder mate your a pro at this why don't u use your own stake knifs buy yourself some expensive japanise shit and go pro heheh
Beard: “Ill take the challenge. Ow and throw in a Doggo menu”
I've been there, great place.
he should some more footage after he finishes the challenge, that's the victory lap and thats always fun, esp. if there's an admiring audience
There's just something about this dude that seems so pleasant. Like he's cool to be around. Like if he was to enter the room, nobody might say it but their spirits are lifted a little bit and when he leaves, it's the opposite.
Awesome sweet ladies 💜💜
It always confuses me to see other countries use ounces instead of grams when they have fully adopted the metric system.
That has got the be the toughest cut of meat I've ever seen.
,
Did they give you a proper steak knife?  Doesn't look like it.
I want to come to the UK for their beef prices, 50 pounds for that, I would go twice a week
That is as near as a miracle as you will ever see absolutely awesome stuff 👍😉
just look at that meat
i hate a 4 lbs tbone the other day guess that is what happens when you watch beard too much lolol
Hey that’s beautiful the knitting club showed up. A real feel good moment.👍👍
Smart move getting the steak cooked as much as it was...100oz steak will lose a lot of water weight being cooked like that ✌️
I know the focus is on the time to eat challenge but the how was the food? great? good? just edible? a lot of the places shown the food looks really good and may be a place i'd like to try (not the challenge) just a regular meal.
Quality content
That guy talking in the video with opened toed sandals, that's just gross in a restaurant even for ladies. Think about that.  Second time to watch this, it's enjoyable. Well done, Beard.
This dude is epic!
You beat the record for two people let alone one alone wow you beat half the time for two and triple the time for one, and eating desert definitely a beast lol
🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩,🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 I did a 🥩 challenge by myself before and pizza and calzones and tacos and burgers and hotdogs and wings and pasta and others
Well they were all very lovely 🙂
That steak looks well done
You're a machine (mad as a hatter) but a machine 🥳😵‍💫🥴
Bro that fat looked hella tasty
I'am Your Newest Subscriber Great Videos John In Clearwater Florida USA
That thing behind you is a bed heater?  I thought it was an old time Popcorn maker.  Learnt something new thanks!
That roast is big enough for my family on Christmas
oh they sound like a good lot, i would love to eat there
he's gonna shit a brick
Looks more like a roast.
Why didn't you ask for a sharper knife? Is it because knives are illegal in your crappie country? That's why you guys are now known as USA-B
always room for dessert :)
I agree OUTSTANDING!
There it is. Yes that make me hungry to see that.
Adam comes over as a nice, personable character, a very polite, amiable chap. Always entertaining watching his clips and those with girlfriend & his sister.
Great Job! You made their day!
Watching this on an empty stomach was a mistake.
this one is insane
Did they give you a butter knife for that huge steak challenge?  No wonder your arms were tired! lol
You should get a custom steak knife with your name on it. One that cuts like a proper knife.
100 oz steak... wow! 8oz steak with sides is enough to make me stuffed
For a challenge like this they could provide a much better quality knife.
Damn this looked good. And that chocolate fudge cake looked awesome.
The name you came up with for the steak was literal GOLD!!
dudes smart, he traines to eat massive amount of food, eats it for free and probably his only meal for that day, haha!
Holy smolley thats half ah cow
yes, it could be a bed warmer.  Or is there a possibility it could be a chestnut warmer?
why did they give you a spread knife to cut a tough steak? laughing so hard. You rock!
How do you burn all these calories afterwards?
Bit disappointing that you didn't eat the fat as well but well done nonetheless.
my kids and I, are debating about what happens later at the tail end.   Jeez you must have clogged up a few toilets in your time :) :)
10:36 :D that eye brow raie killed me
Cows arse on plate
Okay this one just got me to sub. That was impressive. And you got dessert to top it off. Thats a professional at work! Nice work good sir. Keep it up!
How the hell are you always ordering dessert
You don’t sleep with the sheet warmer. You put hot coals in it, then you slide it over the sheets, then crawl in. Toasty…
You are a fu.... monster. Boss level!!!!!!!!
BBQ sauce and well done. Gross.
What a dingy pub. You either put ironed tablelinen down or skip it ey.
It looks like a rost
I love your channel man
What is a chuck steak? Get the man a ribeye!
where did jumper come from when describing you shirt?
and non imperial measure? :)
he ate the cow before even touching a side dish.    disgusting
Do they not give you real steak knives in Europe?
was that a butter knife to a steak challenge?
The G.O.A.T. ! What a beast of a challenge. Congratulations man. My God! 👏👏👏
Why do you have to eat everything one item at a time?
I'm to the fungus! 😂
Watching this almost made me throw up lol good video
Nice Foots but where's the food lol.........?
How did you manage to get all the numbers wrong while narrating 🤣🤣
He disrespected the fat tough... that's delicious
Bro didn’t eat again for a week
Here’s a tip…..bring your own steak knife for the steak challenge’s, amazing effort getting through that lot!
"Norfolk N Chance Steak Challenge " 😆 😄😄😄😄😄
The fat to me is the best part lol
Your shoes where did you get them?
I guess calling it 'our steak challenge' is a lot cooler than 'our medium-sized roast' challenge...
Ok Beard, since you kinda brought it up don’t you get constipated? I’m mean come on how does anybody eat like that and not have a poop the size of a toaster. Somebody had to ask, so I’ll take the hit. Pro cyclist  are very open about the need to poop before a stage race because ounces count on a big climb, so I figure a guy in your line of work can spill the beans so to speak.
no, it's you because you order it well - I get that it cooks out some weight but it's impossible to enjoy chewing it
Def liked after that I clapped for you in my apartment, my girlfriend looked at me crazy lmao, I was teetering on subbing after watching the video with the chicken/mushroom farm subs and realizing our hate for mushrooms, I decided to sub when I watched u eat that desert after wholey shit ur a chad. New sub
I don't know why you would skip the day. Should be seared, though for a nice crust.
im scared to even ask but do you have to flush more than once when you dooky? them safety flushes have to be your life saver
F in a mazin as per!
If it has been commented before I apologise but instead of "Beardlings" I think "Beardos" is catchier. Either way I enjoy your stuff dude. Not just the eating challenges, its cool to hear about your journey. Toodles
definitely  not human.....
😂🤣” on to the fungus” I love it! Hahaha That was hilarious 😆
This was unbelievable! You amaze me!
admit it beard: you like mushrooms
What a pleasure to watch! You smashed the challenge and the service was flawless. 11/10
don t do this shit at home
If every country have few of like him would be Sri Lanka
Not finishing isn’t in the equation for this guy; it’s all about how much time to spare he has 🏆
They should really give you a better knife for this 🤣
Wow 👌
Legend Mate!
This man must be the son of Pac-Man and Kirby
I don't know how anyone could eat that much meat and not go into comma. 😂
The best part of all of these is that my guy asks for dessert! hahaha good shi
One day you're gonna burst and a ton of meat thats not been digested is come bursting out of your stomach like the creature in Alien...but massive respect to you
i can't eat meat with one of those butter knifes. I nead a real knife with teeths. Would probably help to fight sucha gigantic chunk of meat.. and it does look slightly dry
The dessert menu request is the best dunk I've ever seen.
The fat is the best part.
Fat is al tast and nice
I would have eaten the fat
Dam that's crazy, we have this thing called Google Maps here in America and it helps you find exactly what you're looking for so you don't have to talk with people...
Should have asked for a sharp knife.... That looked like a butter knife! Talk about a handicap! Good Job!
I can't even eat 3 pieces of pizza......wtf
This is one of the most British video's I've seen you do haha. Once the ladies came in to knit I lost it! Wish we would have more supportive and polite people like that here in the US, makes me wanna move to the UK. Congrats on the challenge!
Imo you should have to eat the fat
Champ 👏🏻
Wooow Swaffham about 15 minutes from me 😀 good old norfolk lol 😀
Serious question, can you bring your own real knife? A super sharp knife is a chef's greatest friend.
"Have you heard of a place called the White Hart?" Yeah mate, in every small British town ever
So easy a cave man could do it! =P
first of how tha fuuuuuk do you keep your form lol and second please make a video with all your T-shirts so far would be really cool! love your stuff :D
By the color, looked a bit dry, lot of chewing action. Would have been easier rare or medium rare, would have slipped down your throat.
That was epic!
Do you EVER LOSE ????
@1:04 your left foot is 2 times as thick as your right foot !!!
Molly S. eat 23 pounds of Prime Rib in Milwaukee so this is nothing.
I love my English family.  I'm American, but my mother was born and raised in Wolverton.  England is dear to me in a transcendent way, and this video captures it.  Cheers!
The fat is my favorite part
Cant recommend your channel enough! You crank out so much content, thanks for including us in your adventures!
That was insane!!!
They could have given you a proper steak knife 😂
I was really worried about this one. I thought you would explode.😀
watch all videos and still amazed every time : O
lovely interaction with the local tight-knit community
what's crazy about this, is with American sized portions those sides would be considered pretty meager. obviously not the steak tho. that is an inhuman portion of meat. I think a full grown bengal tiger would have leftovers
Cheers mate. Great vid. Enjoyed it bunches as every last one of them. At some point it seemed like you were nearly seeing noises while gumming that last portion of steak down the hatch lol. Keep it up bother.
You made an error mid commentary... you said solo 45mibs duo 30mins ... its 1 hour solo     45mins duo
Respect for the doggo menu!
Just ask for a Chef knife :D Makes cutting way easier
Raina Huang and you together. I'm sure people would love to see that !!
I can watch your videos hungry and actually feel full by the end. Unbelievable how much you can put away. I'm 350lbs of mostly muscle plus a small gut, and I can't imagine finishing half of that.
Remember the old ladies from the Wendy's commercials?..."Where's the Beef?"...lol That steak was massive!.. You must of had an appetite to match! Well done 😎👍
Okay a foid competor but food looks delicious
Never been there, but I'm afraid I couldn't choke down one ounce of British grass-fed beef.
I like the raised eyebrow when he said anal
You blew that challenge out of the water, this is the first time i questioned if you were going to finish it lol Shout out from Anaheim, CA
The weasels could’ve gave you a real knife
looks like a good meal
The people and the staff were so nice
Where's the steak knife!!???????!!!
It’s 60 minutes solo or 45 minutes as a pair.
wow. Have you even lost a challenge?
Sometimes I watch these videos and get inspired and I go eat all the shrooms in jar 🍄
Beard been watching you for years just wondering do you eat anything later on or everything you eat your macros for the day ?. Quality content as usual brother. 👌
I’m surprised they didn’t give if a steak night 😂😂
Cordless carving knife. Essential tool for future steak challenges. No sudocrem, no blisters.
I'm jealous lol that steak looks so good
Should sort yurself out with a decent blade for these challenges. Make your life a lot easier. Good job from 🇿🇦🤘😎🤘
They took the coal pan out of the bed once it had warmed it up ;)
Did they give you a butter knife to cut steak?
How tf do you do that? Brutal
2:11 thats what she said
Lol no napkin used for 15mins 😂😂😂☠️☠️☠️
steak looked tough and dry as a mfker
If you would stop with the forced perspective (to make the food look much bigger than it actually is) thumbnail photos on these videos I would consider subscribing.
The Ashville steakhouse Bristol do an amazing steak challenge 96oz T-bone steak plus extras finish within 1hr and it’s free
did you pay for desert?
I think this one almost got our boy. He was looking weak when he saw the onion rings lol!!!! The iron gullet wins again!!!!
Has beard ever lost a challenge?
Will he will be he did
Congratulations he did it
This dude has the best job in the world. I wonder what his labs look like? All of that sodium at one time cannot be good.
Whats the address again. 🤣 deffo could eat that
Eyyyy in my home county! Been watching you for years bud waiting for you to make it down these parts :)
"we're gonna need plenty of lubricant to get this down"  mmmph
That little girl was absolutely adorable.  "Lovely" as Beard might say.
Dude, do you use an actual bathroom after something like that or just go straight out to the backyard?
The beast
THE MENTOR ON EATING CHALLENGES  PERIOD! makes me eat every challenge lol
You had a hard time cutting the steak, maybe you should invest in your own cutlery including a very sharp knife. :)
We will teach you how to knitt. Yeh 🤣
Eat a entire cow challenge.  You have 1 hour to complete.
Grizzly bear would struggle to cut that streak ahh
Hey Beard - When can we expect to see the latest Nathans performance from a few weeks ago? :)
2.5kg in South Africa is small hahaha my brother would definitely have to finished it and still ask for more lol
Man that fudge cake looked delicious at the end 🤤
It’s official. This guy is an alien from another planet. He must go through a shit load of Philips stomach relief.
Not going to lie but what a waste of good fat I would of eatin that fat is one of the best parts
I really hope that you will now have a side channel of you knitting. Great job on the challenge.
“Grippin mah implements too tightly” LOL
Good god well done beard!!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏
'Never been into sharing' going to eat a 100oz meat meal!!! + desert
The fat on the steak is the best part
He said its an hour for solo,  45 min for pairs
Fat is the best bit mmmmmm won’t buy steak without fat.
lol why do they give you a bread knife and not a proper steak knife?    Hopefully not intentional on their part?? 🤔
For God's sake give Mr. Beard a proper steak knife!
how the fuck u finished that ?! wtfffffffffff
U da man lol 😆
Could've given you an actual steak knife  wow
Ordering dessert is the biggest flex of all time
Actual saying: "Separate the wheat from the chaff" Your version: "Separate the meat from the fat"  I've been on the biggest binge lately of going through your vids. Epic effort mate. Love your work.
Your hands would have been better if that country allowed steak knives..  Looks like you are trying to cut that steak with a butter knife.
That side-look at the word with a tho
Would love to see you conquer an entire Texas style brisket (point + flat). Also would be very cool to see you do something with some highly marbled wagyu beef (ideally A5), but very expensive, but very popular on YouTube and super rich, hard for normal people to eat very much of it.
Legendary
Nice work!! Amazing Strength to cut through that Carcass and digest it an all that...Cool Vans!!...Love the Slip-on Vans my go to shoe too...Great Vid!!
2:13 my girlfriend has never said that to me 🥺
I would love to see Adam learning how to knit and making Mrs. Beard a custom Christmas Jumper.
Love your videos but you should take your own knife with you and make it a sharp one.
“That’s a sustainable weight of a viable baby”!!!! Get that on a T-Shirt Adam!! It should make a killing in merch! 🤣🤣
Good luck in toilet not get any piles
Good grief what kind of steak knife was that?? You should have been able to cut through that with no effort.
Great challenge! And if I'm not mistaken the bed warmer goes under the bed to warm from below. I happen to have one for decoration and its almost identical to that one in your video. ☺
Jesus fucking christ
They would have thrown in hats for the fat.
Wrong Beard 45mins as a couple but 60mins Solo!  Not 30 mins Couple 45 mins Solo!
Couldn't they have given you a better knife lol, a small chef knife or something
😂😂 you are my favourite youtuber!
You need to get you an electric knife for these steak challenges...
How do you keep your body in shape?
absolute monster
TEam FARt!
That’s not a steak that’s a cow
I could do this easy!  (if it was just the sides)
really is he getting dessert after whole meal !!!!!!
LOL the size of the knife
Hand and jaw fatigue is your enemy when eating steaks.  You should consider taking your own fork and razor sharp knife.
Love your vids, curious why you eating folk always go for Diet Coke?
loving the channel. but how the hell hasnt he had an heart attack yet is beyond me
The landlord/ head waiter was a true gentleman and professional fair play, well done again beard! I tried a 50oz steak challenge and failed! You have guts, a lot of guts! Peace
Wow cool 👍 l could eat that with you mate
As if you came to Swaffham, I'm only down the road from there 🤣 next time you're out this way let me know, I'll come show my support 🤪🤟
Since watching you find myself trying to eat food 10x faster love your stuff
i really liked when you said 'hutzpa' LOL perfect word for this situation
That chocolate fudge cake looks amazing!
You are really amazing and supernatural skills you have you are superpower gentlemen I love you so Much as you are a rock star may u live long god bless you for all your win .
I would have absolutely cut off the fat and then grabbed the steak in my hands and went full caveman on it.
Nobody except maybe Molly could do that. You are exceptional with your open void of a stomache
100oz is a hardcore challenge to be fair, a 16oz is a good sized steak and 32 is like "i'm really going for it and can handle my meats" so that's basically 3 of the "bigass" steaks that people brag about being able to eat, plus sides
I would eat the fat.😍😂
Mate, just ask for a proper steak knife. Your fingers will thank you. Great videos! Thanks for always keeping them clean, love watching them with the kids.
My jaw muscles would have quit before my belly would.
I wish I could eat that much food.
Omg! That is huge 😳
The stats you said don't match what the employees said so confused lol 😆
dessert 🍨 menu gets me everytime 😄🇮🇪
You are a MACHINE, thank you for all the amazing videos. 💯💥
Sir, you are the Legend of Yorkshire.... All Kneel!!
i don't know but i pretty like the fat line in but maybe only me :D
Norfolk Inn Chance Challenge
Do you get some kind of endorphin rush when you over stuff with these challenges? The look on your face with the chocolate cake was priceless lol.
I need this steak
Beard Nation!
For some reason this is helping me stick to my diet 🤣 love these videos
Looking at the way yer cutting seems like it's overcooked man. GG though LOL
Can you Eat India'  "BAHUBALI THAli"
that knitting circle hard carried the video :p great work
What cut of meat is that?
Next time you need a wing man I got you…
Wonderful job.
You need  a "greetings beardlings" t-shirt
steak looks disgusting
I thought it was a brass banjo. Imagine sleeping with that and breaking your banjo string. OUCH.! Well done on the challenge. If you beat your meat it will help to tenderise it. 🤣🤣🤣 Love your videos. 👍👍👍
This guy single-handedly made solo have a higher success rate than doubles
To give you a steak that size and not a decent steak knife or serving it sliced is insane 😂
You need to have your own super shard steak knife & fork for these challenges.
nice. well done.......................
Making me hungry brother beard, keep up the good work 👏
The baby’s face 😂😂😂
Didn’t even give him a steak knife
The fat is the best part!
Great job heard congrats on your subcribers , been here since the start! I love watching your vids during my fasts . Always helps me out x
Get a sharper knife, mate.
Why didnt beard eat the fat on the steak?
Beautiful man 🤌🏼
what does your poop look like after these meals?
You need to bring your own knife when you go eat a steak. Restaurant steak knives are garbage
The smallest chocolate fudge cake I've ever seen
Reminds me of the Great Outdoors.
Was... was that perfect Yiddish??
A sharp butcher's knife would be my choice of cutlery in a challenge like that,  better than fighting with a serrated edge.
Should've got them to knit a line in your beard haha
i wonder what part of dinosaur this type of steak comes from
omg u must crap a lot!
All these places that offer free tshirts and never have em should start compensating you when they don't actually have them.  Ripped off again!
The desert ... is it part of your strategy? as in providing a sugar boost to counter the food coma???
bloke said 45mins for 2 people. or solo you get 1hour
The fat is the best part tho.
Maybe on the next steak challenge you should take an electric carving knife with to make cutting the steak easier.
You my friend are an absolute beast!!! Come to Tampa Florida USA and eat the 6 Pound challenge at Frontier Steakhouse!
Bring a battery operated knife
Glad to know I rock the same vans as the beard
Norfolk in chance  That’s perfect  And  I will call my tapas bar  No folks given
You say "Swaffham" like it's world-famous and everyone knows where it is... even most Brits won't have heard of it... small towns like this need clarification of their county, I'm guessing Norfolk in this case? Otherwise, the location just becomes an irrelevant word, meaningless to anyone.
I like when you show your shoes, it makes me smile. You’re my favourite eater by far.
Beard I know you’re not keen on mushrooms but still eat them. Is there any food that if you turned up for a challenge and it was on the plate you would have to turn the challenge down because you could absolutely not touch it?  I’m binge watching your old videos as I only caught up with your channel a week or so ago. Keep it up!
10:47 I'm watching these videos mainly for this part!!! :)
i would love to know your work out plan if i do a week of it ill be a new man
Enjoy the meat challenges while you can. We will soon all be eating bugs thanks to Gates, Biden and all my climate change friends. The cattle industry is being bought out and changed to more climate friendly options like grasshoppers and worms. They have more protein and are healthier for you. Looking forward to seeing you eat 6 pounds of worms and crickets my friend.
They could have given you a steak knife & not a butter knife at least. Surprised you don’t bring your own set of cutlery & unroll it like a doctor or an assassin lol
4:00 no no no it’s 45mins as a pair or 60mins solo lol
Hell yeah. Thats a dream come true
I don’t live far from that pub - might have to go for a steak..!
Did you get a proper meat knife?
why are u so skinny?
Glad to see that when serving up 6lbs of meat they didn't feel the need to dump an entire bag of spuds worth of chips on the plate too.
I eat like a tenth this guy eats how am I fatter than he is? Honestly though he's a beast gwan lad.
This is bigger than the ol’ 96er from great outdoors holy shit
Lol 2 people for the challenge
“Is that one of those things people put in their beds before ‘hot water bottles were invented’”…..  Where does one get these ‘hot water bottles’ you’ve mentioned??? 😂
Not human
Well done in this Video, that was one Monster Steak.  If you had failed, what would have been the cost for that meal?  Please Tell
Already only 4 minutes into the video and im truly impressed by the customer service on show, whomever they employed or have working there are mannered up. Well done Beard x
Mr Beard, just watched the podcast where Danny of Takeaway Fame, You, and some other Chappie were discussing your thoughts about YouTube and the like All very Interesting, but I was very shocked at your Language. Believe me, you don't win friends with F*cking this and F*cking that.  Please listen and follow wise advice, don't use that Foul Language in front of your 'Customers' AKA We, the Viewers of your Content.  As I used to say when I lived in Thirsk, Think On Lad, Think On
INCREDIBLE!!! 100 OZ.
Did they give you a butter knife?
Beef army 🥩🐂
Employee: "With 22 minutes and 43 seconds remaining..."  Lady in the back: "My God!!"
smashed it solo. legend! 100oz! i think i would struggle with 30oz.   FYI: @4:06 dub over incorrect check 1:15. im sure they said as a pair its 45 minutes  or solo 60 minutes not 30 and 45. beat the duo time on your own and then as always desert please. lol
Why not mix rings and chips in between to make it less dull?
No cunts done it cause they give u a butter knife
The sweet cake must taste absolutely amazing after over 3kg of greasy salty stuff.
100 oz = 2 kg and 835 grams
Ain't no cave man people still eat with their hands in some parts of the world it's just natural and convenient specially when eating meat
How??? 😅 Where does it go? Very nice looking steak, I'd probably finish a quarter of it lolz - smashing that like button!
Big respect from Mauritius! 😁
Shouldv told them to cook the fat some more after u cutbit off wouldv been so nice...
This man makes every food challenge look easy
I bet your be on the toilet for a week now trying to pass that steak bro well done as always bro.
just buy your own set of knife for those challenges, will look professional and will be easy to eat????
I don't know if it's ever mentioned, but I love your lexicon! As some who works with words, hearing things like 'occlude' and 'vociferously' pop up among your culinary exploits is music to my ears.
Is he using a butter knife to cut the steak?😂
at least give the man a steak knife
Truly can not believe you find place to put nearly 3kg (or 6.25 pounds!) of steak... Well done, it does look deliciousoso
Dude
Beef army 🥩🤣 love that
Knitted merch?
You gained six pounds in 60 mins
Do an endurance challenge, like going to a fast food restaurant and keep ordering their hamburger meals until to give in
Did he really just get dessert 😆  How??m
@karinaeatskilos you and RandySantel should try this when y’all get to England ❤️
Waste the good Fat...
Epic
How come these really good eaters drink a fizzy drink with it sometimes? I would have thought a gassy drink would bloat you even more? I'm sure he knows what hes doing better then me lol im just trying to understand why?
Wat een top atleet👍
"timer starts when you cut into your streak" I would've started with the other side dishes LOL 🤣
Bruhs colon is the size of a train tunnel at this point.
Looks tasty but damn
Jeden z grzechów głównych - obżarstwo.
The auntie at the back was funny, "my God" 😂🤣😅
Mr. Beard must save a ton on food!
It's almost criminal they get you to do it without a steak knife lol
A steak knife could have worked !
Not sure if it's allowed but you should bring your own very sharp steak knife with a nice comfy handle.🍻
Do you get blood work done regularly? Always curious about that.
No steak knife,  bit harsh 😂
gz n 2m!!!
And a merry hoots scoo to you too !
How incredibly childish.
Man what are your teeth made of. Crazy!!!
The fat is the best part!! My digestion stopped working years ago but one of my last solid food meals was a steak I bought with winnings in Vegas from Gordon Ramsay's pub As last meals go. It was heavenly,.   I. Get by on broth or yogurt, but it's just preventing the inevitable-- feeding tube.  Now I just watch Beard eat.
I need to go fasting for 3 days before trying this
Blessed that they were not going to make you eat that huge slice of fat lol. I could never even if it was a challenge 🤢
shout out to the knitters
Why the start of this video of the church and the town looks like the town model of the movie beetle juice
Wonder how much u would eat stoned and munchied, 3 skips or food and water cooler
I genuinely don’t understand where all this food goes lol
This made me hungry. Nice job.
Doesn’t help that it’s cooked to death
10:36  The raised eyebrow when he said "anal"  lol
This. Freakin'. Legend!
Have you ever considered asking for a proper steak-knife when tackling a full cow like that?
Want seconds?
hey fella you look like asterix , but you eat like obelix
Lovely staff and customers. Very wholesome. Good stuff!
Only found this channel about 2 weeks ago and I'm so glad I did. Enjoyed many vids since them, great work, cheers!
I just recently found your channel. I’ve watched several of your challenges already and I’m enjoying your videos very much. I am not a fat eating person. My dad would always say I would do surgery on my steaks 🥩 before I ate them. Needless to say I was always the last to finish. I’d fail this challenge outright but if I had to eat all that fat I’d be sick. It blows my mind that you can eat so much in a single setting.
1:12 says solo is 60 mins and 2ppl is 45mins plus he's told when beginning he is too be left alone for an hour
Why not eat the gristle? That's the best part 😁
Even Joey couldn't finish that... Oh! here come the meatsweats 😯😯
Make a collab with the italian Thomas Hungry, he's a beast too!
dude, why do you always wear sweaters?? you gotta get a sleeveless or something haha
“Greetings beardlings”😂
What a workout 😤
Just reminds me of the great outdoors with all that fat 😂😂
Stop talking and eat, you have people coming behind you trying to break your record
is that a butter knife?
Meat is extremely easy to eat.
how much is 100 oz in kilograms? im too lazy to google
Beard's so clean and tidy even after so much eating.. Big fan bro, Love from India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
You should carry an electric knife! Well done on this challenge. WOW!
You're hilarious!
I once did a 4 lb burger challenge in South Africa,was a great burger and all but the stomach ache wasn't worthit
My teeth hurt just from watching this video
You're the champ man no doubt about it. You can retire now, please retire 🙏 worried you might die
I was so happy you finished, that when they started clapping I started clapping as well. Alone. In my kitchen.
Once it was a certain size, I'd have ditched the cutlery and just picked it up and chomped on it.
Poor guy had to eat 100oz of overcooked steak
This guy doesnt even need food at his appartment...this is the way he should feed everyday😭
Question do you have you bloods checked regularly
damn that cake looked heavenly
Beard is going to bite of more than he can chew
What amazing appetite.
What a cheap dull knife.
ShitCan the  utensils and caveman that thing
U think they would give u something better then a butter knife 🤦‍♂️lol. Well done as always good sir 👍🏼💪🏽.
Did you choose to have it well done?
Is that dry? It sure looks like it
Found your channel 4 days ago, binged over 50 videos. Now up to date!  You are just crazy man, youre smashing!
in the wise words of the beard.... "EAST HYAA" hahaha you mucked it bro! well done as always!
That knife looks a bit small for that steak
The other kind of bed pan
You need an electric knife yuh big woose, 😂
MEANT FOR TWO, BUT HE MADE THIS CHALLENGE MEANT FOR ONE!
GIANT STEAK CHALLENGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the collab comment hit me hard
This is one I actually didn’t think he would do. Amazing
SPAM UP!
As usual,  he just destroys it!
“You can do it Bruce, go Bruce” 🤣
You got the time wrong. 45 as a pain. 60 minutes solo
So like how?  Lol awesome be careful man your health is more important then views.
The fat is the best part 🤣
The kestrel Inn in Derby does a 200oz challenge try that one Mr Beard.
those shoes looking fire
Ohh yes!! That's an old bed warmer behind you!! Sure was nice to pass that over cold sheets before ya hop in..and no..ya don't leave it there..lol
If there wasn't so much fat you could just slice it into strips and hold the meats.  But alas fatts
That steak looks a bit too well done really. :/
A steak that huge and they dont even have proper steak knifes ? that is, not great. Might as well have given you plastic utensils.  Love watching your videos, always makes me hungry :p
What do you eat when you go out for ordinary meal
Eeeeeesssssshhtoooooola!
Mate you gotta be proper hungry for these challenges, I'd be having a bubble trying to finish these meals
Have you ever started a challenge but not been able to do it because cooked badly?
Hey Beard, do you let your system completely digest the food after one of these challenges, or do you purge? Have to believe allowing your digestive tract to process so much is dangerously unhealthy.
How he is so skinny? WTF
Seriously how does he say so thin? Even if he attends the gym everyday there's no way you could burn the amount of calories he consumes that has to be about 5,000 minimum?
Love how they give you what looks like a butter knife for a side of beef !!! Nice strategy on their part.
I want to see the toilet at his house: that’s what I want to really  👀
What's wrong with you...come on😛😋😠😡be angry and finish
Came to the channel for the alimentary spectacle, stayed for the impressive vocabulary.
That pub gets a tick for having a dog menu
You greedy bleeder!  😂🤪👍 Keep up the good work man.
That fudge cake looks so good
Onion rings and BBQ is so gooooood
They could’ve at least given u a proper steak knife!!!!
HOW ???? im just speechless ...
After that challenge "Anal" might not have been best choice of words!
That was impressive to say the least
Why didn't they give him a steak knife  ?
Did they not give you a proper steak knife? Might of helped with the cutting ....
Another Great Challenge Adam, well done.  By the way the bed warmer comes out of the bed before you get in, you don’t have to share!!!
Learn how to knit! Make that bib lol
well done beard
Man this guy going into town eating free food 😂
No way he not faded during these lol
They could've at least given you a proper steak knife to hack at that hunk of beef. Looks terribly over-cooked/dry too. Well done, nonetheless mate!
it really seems impossible
Figuratively speaking; your the best eater I've ever seen on U-tube hands down and respect up. GREAT JOB!! I knew you could do it.😃😉❤❤❤
You might beat the 45 min team challenge mark, you're at 36 mins. Amazing! Smh.
Adam, you never disappointed with your valiant efforts. To say this was a great effort, I am sure would be disappointing on my part. So I will say only one thing. " I am speechless. " 7 or 8 pounds of any food is unbelievable. But with most of it steak, makes a vegetarian cringe. Thank you Mr Clean Beard.
If they grilled it better it would have been easier to take down, let alone cut. It looked tough as hell.
Wow awesome
There's a global food crisis coming and people like this eating enough for 10 people for fun. What a messed up world we live in
VICTORY DESSERT
Damn dude you are a truly impressive man.
Top job Beard!!!!  You ought to start traveling with your own really sharp knife!!  Maybe make  a signature version available to the fans!!
Isnt it about time for a sister beard video?
Surprised you didn't just ask some random bloke to be your partner just to eat the mushrooms.
No mother today
norfolk'n chance steak challenge is a sick name
What kind of shoes are you wearing
Did you just dip your greens in barbecue sauce? 9:07
Congrats on 2mil brother
You should definately take personalised own cutlery that are as sharp as all hell
It looked completely grey inside. I hope it's red as you get past the edges.
No one talking about how he looked at the kid said thats almost as big as you mate, don't worry though im not gonna eat you! I draw the line at babies 🤣🤣🤣
they should have given you a real knife! seem like really nice people though
The fact that you used a knife and fork is so annoying.
Love your channel, just found it a few days ago. You're so wholesome and a beast at the same time.
that is crazy 100ozs of steak ! i do not know how this is possible
They were very pleasant ladies
You need a better knife sir. That is part of the struggle.
The fat is the best part
Its seems in this challenge, the steaks were high. :] Also really liked the look of that steak, it wasnt that horrible outside burnt- inside raw look like those US steaks.
They could have given you a better knife. I'm surprised you didn't ask. That looks like a butter knife from here lol.
Dam down my neck of the woods and I missed a chance to meet you!
Me watching while struggling to eat my medium pizza🥹
Ridiculous!! Flipping ek
This guy's a blast to watch... his humor is a kick as well...
4:05 there is an error, you said that as a pair you've got 30min to finish it and as a solo 45; but a few min before staff said for solo is 60min for pair it's 45min
The jaw gets one hell of a workout
This is what we imagine we could eat when we are hungry
Imagine if he died of hunger!
Quick question. Do you still tip on the meal? I know it's free, but the staff is still putting in that work.
earlier it was 60 for solo and 45 for two but later you said 45 for solo and 30 for 2 and now I'm confused xD
Great people at the restaurant!! Thank you for sharing!
How much wasit if not completed
I was gonna say best not have to eat the fat
🧔🏻 "ahh cool.... that makes sense 🤔🧐"
By ‘eck Beard..The White Heart! Very posh 😂 tha’s gone all posh 😂 👍🏻
How does all that food get through your guts? I’m thinking regurgitation eliminates (eliminates) that problem but I could be wrong. Still impressed either way.
2:05 min.: .....OMGGGG!!!! CUTEST THING TODAY!!! AND SHE SMILEEES!!! IM DONE, I QUIT!!!
Jesus wept, i can only manage a small dominos if its just me eating it.   😂
i actually do eat the fat and I actually enjoy it...
I’ve never seen anyone put cream on chocolate cake.  Need to give that a try
What time of day do you usually do your challenges? The places always look empty!
For anyone wondering 100 oz. = 6.25 lbs.
How can people now know how to make good mushrooms? Even those fries looked questionable.
What an absolute savage!! Very impressive my friend!
💋❤✌👍
I’ve only just discovered your channel and the amount of food you can put away is inspiring 😂
1.5 mill views in a coupla days!
I always wonder, does he even chew haha
I love the fatty bits on steak😁
Where is that restaurant?
Do one with mattstonie
You'd remove the bed warmer before you get in lol. You're right, it would probably hurt a bit! No doubt a few Darwin Awarders probably ended themselves that way
How can a chef fuck up such a beautiful piece of meat by making it nearly well done.. ffs.
The toilet sessions this guy must be having...
Its disgusting i know, but i find it hard NOT to wonder what the next morning is like... lmfao
The swaffham knitting society!❤️😂🤣❤️
Eat the fat!! best part!!
Swaffam is a Sister/Partner town of my hometown Hemmoor in Germany. I think this is the first time that I see a video from there. Cheers
I know you're not a mushroom fan, but I was thinking eating them with the steak might have been easier as well of helping the steak go down.
Holy fuck, I’m in Marham….I wish i knew you were kicking it there..beast!
6:35 man! I was so prepared for a mrs beard joke their! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thats looks way smaller than the thumbnail .. easy one
Wow 🤩 wow  100 Ounces steak 🥩  Plus the sides  And asking for desserts 🍨 WOW
It's the dude from dude perfect! Didn't know you had a 2nd channel!
Probably wouldn't have hurt so much if they gave you a steak knife instead of a butter knife....
never seen you so winded by a challenge, good work
I gave a like for the 2 knitters
Big woman in the back became horny by your skills.
22 minutes to spare; you should have cleared the fat as well! The bedpan was filled with hot embers, but you wouldn't sleep with it, it was just rubbed over the sheets to remove the chill (and damp!) before you get into bed. One bedpan would probably be used for the whole household.
next episode: Beard knits food
How much would it have cost you if you failed ?
After watching years of your vids it still leaves me baffled as to how you’re not 200kg+ 😂
Imagine the colossal dumps this guy must take.
Dont'cha like the fat? Thats the best bit!
that was great!!!
It can't be 22 minutes plus, remaining, given we're at 38 minutes and then some.
ANOTHER  DONE AND ON TO THE NEXT!!!!✌🏾🤟💯 YOU GOT TELL ME YOUR SECRET MY GUY!! I NEED TO BE LIKE YOU WHEN I EAT AND COMPETE..💯💰💰👍🏼😎🧔
Norfolknchance my planetside2 character name 😂👍👍
Well done as well, extra hard challenge
I think the thing in the corner was meant for warming your bed up before you got into it in days gone by. Probably an antique
That look on his face when taking his first bite of dessert. Makes me want it and have that look too 😋😛🤩
I dont get it. The fat is always my favorite piece and it gives the connected meat so much flavour. Beats me why everyone wants it cut off.
Is this even safe lol
Plenty of lubricant...😂😂😂😂😂
£50 for 100oz! I would just buy that to take it home for lunch for the week.
That’s known as a roast here in the states, rump roast to be exact, not a steak! I honestly don’t think my family would put that down!
Guy need to bring his own custom utensil with comfy handles and a super sharp knife to these steak challenges to helps with the cutting.
The way he goes for the desert after downing a small calf 😂
The flex of asking to see a dessert menu is gold
Maybe I heard wrong but I thought they said 2 people had 45 mins and 1 person had 1 hour?
Why didn't you ask for a better knife lol
He's not human. He's like a piece of iron..
whats up Mr.Beardmeat! watching from Philippines
Why the heck would they give you a butter knife for steak
You should bring your own knife lol
Do you throw up after? Or you just have a really really fast metabolism?
Wtf is this knife ?
Meat sweats are real.
I actually thought you might not make that one lol... but you did of course!
2M subscribers - 1.6M view. 👌
Beard always wearing long sleeve shirts but he rolls them up lol
Beast
I would have gone for the fat too. definitely wasted a lot of time and effort cutting that steak. But great job!
Know you eat it fast like this. But do you enjoy your foods you eat like the taists of them
Wow! Looks yummy! 😺
My dream
Canadian Brewhouse’s Rita Burger Challenge (Kelowna) BC  Canada
Mate, dipping the salad in the bbq sauce 😂
You literally have a black hole for a stomach, I love watching your videos.
Oooshtoolaaah
How your grip your implements is so important. If you squeeze too tight, it's gonna hurt.
૮ ˙Ⱉ˙ ა rawr!  <- u  💕
You should have asked for a steak knife. Having a sharp knife takes the struggle out of cutting up the steak. (You could even bring your own!)
If you ever do a dessert challenge, when you're finished, do you ask for a steak?
Dayum,that's bigger than my mom's Sunday Roast.
heres a butter knife to eat your 100 oz steak
Next time ask for a proper steak knife! That butter knife definitely slowed you down significantly.
Have You ever done a massive salad challenge?
YOU NEED TO STOP TALKING AND EAT YOU WOULD SAVE MINUTES
Why not mix the shrooms with any of the other sides? I loathe shrooms myself but I could force them down. I wish there were challenges like this back in my 20s. Maybe there is challenges by age group. I hope you have seen the movie The Great Outdoors. Once again Well Done Beard
I want the fat pieces
This guy has about 10 times my capacity and I thought I was pretty good
Is it just me or does your left shoe look bigger than the right shoe? 😭😭
I was thinking great outdoors 😆 🤣. Thank God he didn't have to eat the fat
Surprised didn't full caveman from the start. Tear it apart with hands. Then cut up anything too large to manageable pieces.
How the f did you do that!
Outstanding as the man said!!
Keep yo mojo n keep your money. Just let me have the baby
OMG, half a cow on that plate. Nice pub with nice staff.  Huge effort that Mr Beard, you nailed it. Lovely food, fresh and quality. I just don't know how you do it, lol.
You animal
You seem like a genuinely great guy, I’d love to cook you a challenge.
Excellent!
I would love to know how much they charge if you don't succeed in the challenge because that is a huge steak that I would love to just have to take home for later lol
I would love to try and eat that...key word.."TRY!??"🤣😂😂😂😂
Congratulations on 2m dude
You give me false hope every time I see a “challenge burger” at a local restaurant 😂
Great Videos 🧔
They could have atleast given you a steak knife 🤣🤣
You sicken me, with your absolute gluttony.
Half the challenge is using that tiny knife..
Ohhhhhhhhh man. Nice. Niiiiiiiice. (Nes Manga)
That's insane,, I'd only have to look at that plate, ans I'd put on 5 stone,, how do ya manage it 🤪🤪🤪
Man that desert turned up the mustard ☮️
This bloke must shit like a T-Rex!!!!
I'd have taken that big lump of fat home and made beef scratchings and dripping out of it ! 😋
They need to get you a bigger knife Beard!
have you ever lost a food challange on camera?
Steak looks yummy 😋
Oh my gosh! I'm impressed. Glad I subbed, 🥩🥘🍲🥩🍞🍔🍟🥩
Id love to see you as an extra/cameo in a movies restaurant scene, just sitting in the background smashing a ton of food...
God damn.
They could’ve given you a better knife…geez….you spent more time cutting the steak than chewing it…
Animal 😂
Sick invidual
How do you burn the calories off?
You just ate a baby
Thats was toughest challenge in my book
Dude you should come to India you will earn much then you deserve

This looks like a heart attack challenge! Well done, mate.
This guy is crazy that’s all I can say 🤣
I would loooove to do this challenge as a team of 2.  I would eat the fat too. I love steak fat😁
Can you eat a loaf of bread???
Create compilation of you asking for desert..
Completed it mate
Another great video! You rock
Congratz on the 2 mil subs Beard😊
Smashed it despite being at a disadvantage with a butter knife ffs 🤣🤣
New subscriber here...and me and the Mrs have watched about 20 plus videos....you could say we are hooked! LETS GET IT! 🤣🤣🤣😄
Hello Mr. Beard been watching some of your videos, I wonder how do you stay so slim?
That’s the most impressive thing I’ve ever seen.
Hay man heard you done the bin lid challenge up my neck of the woods, can't wait to see the vid gutted I missed you man  I literally live a stones throw away hahah
I would have teamed up with you an had the onion rings an mushrooms an chocolate cake :) um a slice of beef when you got the sauce not before an do they serve salt an pepper with the meal ?
🔥
11:56 He gets a diet Coke.Ugh! How on earth can one swallow a sugary drink with meat or any other savoury food ?
Congrats on 2M
It's quite fun to watch, the ladies in the back could give a shit
35 mins for 2, 60 mins  for one? Isn't that what he said?
I tune in for you to smash challenges……… not to see a ponytail on your face!!  What exactly is that rubber band thingy doing hanging off the bottom of your face? You earned that beard. Stop holding it back!
I've got to say buddy you're one of the friendliest YouTubers in general. I love your videos bro keep them coming cheers from the US!!
I am honored to have become the 2.000.000th subscriber.
How are you not 20 odd stone fella, I had meat sweats just watching
The dessert flex never gets old
I have a weird relationship with beardmeatsfood... It's almost like a diet kind of teaser. It makes me eat healthy while still satisfying the fatass inside me hahaha. If I wanna binge eat a million things I just watch him almost kill himself and I'm satisfied hahah
live in Dereham used to work in swaffham didn't know this was a challenge there.
Try eat full lamb on rice from AL KHALLEJ woodsley road ls8 😂😅
Try the premier inn “best ever burgers’ 5 burgers all with chips and sides!!
That stake looked fantastic.
could anyone explain how he doesn't gain weight from this? If I so much look at something, I begin gaining pounds.
Maan your a beast!!
The Beard conquers 👍
0:46 That "Yeees" was one hundred percent "Fuck, not this dude here!... she remembered
What about a business with a food challenge where you get unlimited 1 side but you have to eat a 1 pound burger / 1 pound of toppings on a pizza / something like that But heres the twist. They need to eat an entire jar of mayonnaise. How they do it is up to them, they can drink it, dip in it, or use a spoon. The fun part is if they dont pass they get charged for the food, the mayo, the puke bucket (they sign a waiver agreeing to clean their puke if they puke), and all the sides
The Beard is less than a God but more than a man
Congrats on the 2million I been watching you a long time my son likes your  channel now awsome as always.
You think you can beat Joey chestnut ?
They gave you a butter knife for a giant steak?!!! I use a steak knife for my small steaks!
Gets to eat for free Every time lol 😅
I’m on a pretty heavy weightlifting routine. I have to eat a lot of lean meat. The other day I put down 2 pounds of London broil and was still hungry. I want to go find a meat challenge like this. I don’t think I’ll beat it but you never know 🤷‍♂️
…beardlings?      Why do I kinda like that name though?
It’s meant for two. Bring Mrs. Beard along. Have her snack on fries as you eat the rest. 😃
Congrats For 2m Bruhhhhh❤
I can't tell of your videos make hingy or sick.
Some kind of foliage 😂😂👏👏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
How about a proper steak knife. That one is child size.
Big ass steak!
Congratulations on hitting 2m subscribers!
I'm crying in kilos.
That was some Steak... What a feat!.. Well done Beard.. You're a Geezer mate.
Well in lad
Your a freak dude, I bet you’ve had people think you must’ve filled your pockets lol 😂 well done 👍
It's the beard that gives the power to succeed in all the challenges.
Having a dessert just takes this piss..
One incredible person when it comes to eating food what a man 👍👍👍👍👍
any vegan around
This is practically just down the road from me!
Hearty Congratulations on reaching 2 million subscribers Beard!
Hands down my favorite competitive eater on YouTube.  Adam you sir are Awesome 👌 👏 👍
Not cutting off the fat lol
you are a beast. do you actually keep all the food inside you or do you force yourself to vomit after going home?
Would it make sense to cut the entire thing in small pieces and than get to it? All that chewing must be exhausting, maybe if you just swallowed smaller peieces whole?
BBQ lol what about ketchup or steak sauce
you must take the most massive dumps ever lmao
Omg so amazing 2 million subscribers.  I'm not surprised you are truly amazing
That fool gonna be sick
Those ladies were so wholesome. Sadly. Knitting trend is dying with new generation
Would you do a Scottish fish n chips n seafood challenge?
Finally! The collab we’ve all been waiting for - Beard and the Swaffham Knitting Association! 😂
Fucking ads again
Never cut the beard! I believe it gives you power to eat anything!
Machine
This reminds me a bit of the Old 96er.
Chutzpah? You got a kosher challenge upcoming? Lol whered you even learn this non-english word
Nice shoes 🔥
You should stop by Newport Oregon and try the Newport Cafe's 8lb Super Ultimate Monster Burger.  My favorite thing to get when I'm out there =)  Then you can go relax on the beach after.
John Candy would've eaten the fat.
CONGRATS ON 2MIL 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Foliage...that's going to be my new one when the Mrs tries to feed me salad next 😑😑😑
Well done on another great video
What does the carbonation do for you from the coke?
Most of your challenges look delicious. But this looks like a big chunk of horse meat. I will keep to the steaks in the USA.
Ya smashed that big boy
Looks like that steak came with a couple of bingo wings. 😂
Do they give you a crap knife so it takes longer?
Congrats on 2m subscribers🥳🎉
I’ve noticed that with ribeyes specifically, a sliver of the fat with the meat (although it isn’t as tender as a hunk of brisket meat or pichana typically) goes amazingly with the meat and helps moisten it a lot. I know it’s a rump steak so it might be a tougher fat. But for the most part, a properly cooked steaks fat will offer much help as far as moistening the meat and flavoring it of course
WHAT A BEAST !!!
You should bring your own electric knife to steak challenges 😆  Your a legend mate, love your vids🤙🏼
Love the banjo in the back
Nice shoes brother 🤙🏼
me seeing a new Beard video "please let him have the food cool down before he starts eating this time" gets meat sweats instead.
Fat is flavour
bro someone please tell me the name of those slip ons i need that colorway
Two million subs!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This reminds me of the old 96'er' from the Great Outdoors with John Candy
That's genuinely impressive
2 million subs
I bet his jaws were sore
Would it have hurt the challenge if they gave you a steak knife? Lol
Congratz on 2M Beard. Well deserved!
I have no idea why your videos showed up as recommended, but I am completely hooked on them.  You are absolutely insane.  I mean that in an insanely awesome way.  I am dumbfounded by how you crush these challenges like it's just a mid morning snack then ask for more.  I feel full just watching you eat and feel like I need to go on a diet.  Keep crushing it.
I love how friendly and positive he is while eating and talking
My kids always find room for desert after they say they are full and can’t eat another bite. I did it as well. So it’s a tribal rite.
I order regularly from a restaurant that has a menu for your dog
They could have provided a better steak knife
I don't think people realize how much meat 100 ounces is..
y u use a butter knife?
No ones gona beat that bro hahaha hollllly hell that was a good one!
So, Im new to the channel and for the life of me I can't figure out what you're saying right before you dive in and eat. There's two sayings..  cheers from Canada
How much is an ounce in metric btw?
Mind blown once again. How is this humanly possible?  Amazing job!
Why does he have his steak cooked like chicken
how???
But how many eggo mini waffles can you eat bro
Why didn't you get a steak knife?
A sustainable weight of a viable baby? That’s well over 6 pounds without sides, it’s a normal size baby 😮
I don't know how he does it .. or anyone in this field.
You're a dang legend brother! Much love from Florida.
Happy 2 mil
can you bring your own electric turkey saw
i dont know how to ask in a family friendly way ( and i know everyone has wondered this before ) what is your worst poop story or no poop which ever the case may be ?  I just need to know , sorry
Congrats on hitting 2M subs today, Beard! Keep bringing the riveting content!
Imagine if he had a razor sharp Japanese Shigefusa petty knife? 😳 So much time was wasted just cutting the 🥩.
love your videos. just started watching today from Indiana
Heck yeah man!
yess, already two million subscribers , keep up the spirit to make content
Doesn’t look like they gave you much of a knife.
My son was 6lb 11.5oz at birth (5 weeks early) which is 107.5oz. So yeah viable baby size indeed.
Cuts like shoe leather.  Delicious looking
Start the timmer when he cuts  the steak....    great  eat all the other shit first...   dont cut the steak No timer!!!!!
That's not a Steak it's a Cow with the horns snapped off it!!
No steak knife?!?! :p
2,9 kg for us mainlanders
After eating all that then they give you the smallest piece of chocolate cake ever!!! 🎂
You proved you ARE the best! Six point 25 pounds plus sides. I am so impressed. Everyone there seemed so nice. Really enjoyed your video tonight. Well done, Beard. p.s. How was the BBQ sauce, was it just the bottled stuff or homemade?
So close to 2M 😊
Location  SWAFFHAM IN NORFOLK.
Was that a butter knife too???!!!!
Beards wearing classic slipon black/underwater color my mans keeping it dapper!
Odd you don't have to eat the fat
why would they give you a butter knife and not a STEAK knife???
WHAT THE FUCK i can barely eat an 8oz steak, what is this my god bro
Great Job as usual , 👏  but why don't you just pick up the steak from the start and eat it instead of cutting it in pieces for an hour???
5:56 -- I would have eaten that!! 😃 It looks EXTREMELY flavorful!! 🥰🥰 (can u tell I'm hungry & I don't get paid untill next Friday??)  😭😭😭
Love the content from Africa  Can you please try somme African foods challenge
Epic
Yo this is crazy. Good job.
So when do we get a video of mrs beard and yourself knitting something 🤔🤔 I think a knitting collar is in order with those wonderful young ladies
Am I crazy or is that a butter knife your using to cut that stake with?
I had a 25 oz it’s was silly big 100z is crazy
Maybe next time don’t use the dullest steak knife I’ve ever seen lol Nice job bud love the vids
Good god man! I did the 72oz challenge in Florida and that was a bit much.
Where's the video of you poop'n these meals out?
Knew u could it man!!!!
Outstanding Beard !
I cant belive I missed you!! So close to my home town!
The Bearded Beast strikes again
Well done beard. That was still mooing lol. MOT alaw
Rh
I imagine you were terribly constipated after this?
My wife is a vegetarian...so I don't get a lot of meat around the house.  So it's always a welcome pleasure when I do.  But I have to say, just WATCHING you eat over 6lbs of steak makes me want to give up meat for a year.  (ha ha)
Almost 2 million subscribers
Dude deserves more credit for the simple fact he is eating in the UK. Low flavor territory. Respect from Chicago, big dawg.
So who held your hair back while you threw up?
Everyone has that extra belly to put pudding in no matter how much you have eaten 😄 🤣
I get so much joy watching your videos, such a down to earth person! Never doubt your abilities to eat such big feeds!
USE A STEAK KNIFE.....
60 minut alone, 45 pairwork...
Do you know a Guy named Obélix
Beard ,  You need to go back on the road to NYC! Plenty of great challenges I’m sure !
I found ur channel few days ago and been binge watching your and gregs videos like four days now. Maybe I need a life. Moran and Doucette hype. Hope you make a collab video sometime. This is entertainment at its finest. Lets geddiiiitt and eat harder than last time. lol xD
Alright, just about 2 million subs.. Beard, you have made it beyond stellar territory!!! But having a channel build on binge eating enormous amounts, you do you do for local hunger?
How does he even get out of the chair after…
Wearing open toed footwear to a restaurant is horrific, to be wearing them AND be working there is unforgivable.   Nobody wants to see stinking hoof trotters where scran is involved.
There's a Norfolk in SE Virginia USA, and the locals pronounce it the right way.  My Pop told me about a cheer one of the local schools had back in his day: "We are the girls of Granby High! We don't drink and we don't smoke! Norfolk! Norfolk! Norfolk!"
Awesome Beard!!
Its a sin ordering a steak like that cooked well done... looks tough as rubber, what a waste.
Aw those ladies were darlin’s
What’s with the butter knife? Get a real steak knife.
It's funny that I'm always more impressed he asks for dessert than how much freaking food he just consumed..lol
You are  .....as allways....and keep this in your Mind....in German......unfassbar.....😂
Always love it when the folks who work at the resturant/run it are excited for you to try and even more excited when you win.
SOON: BeardMeetsWool channel announcement.  XD
With the cost of energy and food. I would take a doggie bag...
Well done. If you take laxatives before hand clean out the whole system... Cusrterd and iceream.. Well done. World record. In that pub...
lol both steak challenges I've seen on this channel were in empty restaurants. Is this something deliberate, as in this has to be done behind closed doors?
👏🏻👏🏻👊🏻👊🏻
Ah my neck of the woods. Swaffham is a fantastic place and although I've not had a chance to eat there yet I have heard The White Hart is a bloody good pub.
I love this show.  When it uploads I already know he's going to beat the challenge!
30 seconds of ads 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ you must be raking it in mate
The manager said a team gets 45 minutes and solo u have 60 minutes to finish. Good luck Mate
This guy is just going to every state and destroy every challenge.
What I want to know is how the hell is this guy still alive?
I dont get it... You are famous.. You get your "wish" granted.. And you wished, that you could eat,  impossible amounts of....food bruh??  Are we realy that limited? You realy could not come up with a better wish?  Tell you what kid. This year, there is a Super Awakening happening for ALL of us..  When that happens, your "average joe" wil become a powerfull medium.  A powerfull medium wil become a Guru..  And a Guru, wil become a Prophet.  And you... Wil be bottom trash. People are going to find out the Truth, they wil know Spiritual abusers when they see them. And more importantly, they wil know what you have done in secret.  Celeberty's Witches Satanists Luciferians   You wil al be exposed.. And mind you...  That the awoken People wil be able to fight back with their collective new Knowledge and Wisdom.  I repeat: The likes of you wil be bottom trash, in that New Order.  Ps Venus has arrived.. It was kinda hot, globally i mean these past days..  Venus has arrived in the Sixth Heaven. Thats why. Sixth Heaven is The Eden, of the World of Enoch. What does that all mean?  Litterally: Above wil be Below And Below wil be Above  Then the warning of The Bible: Woo on to them who wil call Good, Evil. And Evil, they wil call Good.  Comes very much in to play then.  Courtesy of >That< Son of Man.  If you dont get what I am saying, then YOU dont have Spiritual Wisdom or Spiritual Understanding to "Hear".  Come back when you do have it, and read it again. See what you think then.
The fat is my favorite part lol
Just down the road from me
Chutzpaa lol 👍
He always makes sure it’s free I’ve noticed he doesn’t like paying for the meals
Should of used Sharp Scissors to cut the Steak 😁👍
I would have got arm ache from cutting it, no steal knife?
Have you got a list of places that do these challenges, I'm from the Midlands
Cut the mustache
I couldn't eat that fat. That's an unreal amount of fat. As you can tell I said this before I watched the video..... thank goodness you don't have to eat that.
Beardlings.. really? 🤣 you going full cult leader now mate? 🤣
Wtf did I just witness ffs lol 😂
Unbelievable skills and mindset! 👏👏Love the bants too. They seemed a cracking bunch.
mrs beard: be on your best guard once the baby comes out! we got ourselves a cannibal over here. jk, great job Adam u nailed it.
Sheer gluttony when half the world is starving, these food programs are disgusting
Would love to watch one of your challenges if you’d use a song called Best Beard Out. By the beards. Check it out 😂😂
Would love to see video about how you get this good at eating. Just the chewing alone would kill me let alone fitting it all in
Ohhhh just up the road from me that
I wish you a very long life... But i would like to see the coroners' face  during stomach dissection 😉
Im always chewiing thin air watching his vids
After years of watching from recommended suppose I'd better subscribe and help push beard to 2 million so we can watch him eat 2 million spiced mushrooms
I feel like you had to waste so much energy cutting up the steak that it would interfere
That was absolutely disgusting!
That restaurant needs to get steak knives for the customers. 😁
The food looks great, I'd like to try it under non challenge conditions.
Wow 10 minutes a pound. Slower than usual 😆
beard is a beast
Just up the road from me , didn't expect you to head down this way Adam😂
Your arms might not have been nearly as tired if you they gave you a steak knife. 🤣
Wow soo close to 2 Million subscribers Beard!!!! :)
Eating a steak and watching the video 👌👌
just watching mr beard chew the steak makes my teeth ache
Oh common Adam, that fat would help it go down. That's usually one of the best parts! 😂🤣😂😂🤣
I always enjoy the mushroom sequence
Beard...  "I've never been into sharing" 😂🤣
Oh man that looks right up my street I love a steak!!  What kind of steak is it?  Looks a nice pub and worth a visit definitely!
11:31 that satisfaction face of mr beard❤️🔥
Second word in and I was already chuckling. Beardlings. What a great word 👏 😀
Brand new to the channel and loving it.  Can someone explain what it means when he says "Ishtoolah!", or am I hearing it wrong?  Thanks!
That’s it, Beards gonna change his channel to BeardMeetsKnit
I would never have got anywhere near finishing that because I would have eaten the fat first as I love that stuff! Great job done!
Iam now really hungry
4:04 noooo, adam, you got it wrongg hahaha – wasn’t it 45 and 60 respectively? :0
you were well looked after, great job !
In your honor i ate a full bag of Big'n' beefy flavarings by hula hoops while watching this. No small feat but i managed it along with a cherry pepsi max.
2:12 that’s what she said
My jaw muscle would be dead💀
Norfolking chance!! Hahahahaha! That was perfect!
Man doesn't even chew💀
I bring my own folding knife if i want to eat steak outside. The knives they provide here are a joke. More like butter knives 😂 (Asian here, where our steaks are never as thick as yours 😆)
Is that one your best to date ? That was a Hunk of Beef (Mrs B Ssssh, ) 🤭
Just watched The overlap with neville paddy and maddie. They both said they watch your channel during camp 🤣🤣
Each time I watch a challenge I'm simply amazed at your ability to scoff down food.  Where do you put it?  Is there no limit?
You my friend are the G.O.A.T.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Honestly, Adam, you need to start bringing your own knife. I've been bringing my own to every steak night for more than a decade - you can keep it sharp, actually cutting the flesh, and not waste so much time sawing away at your meat like a carpenter.
When you take a crap  and hear a ghostly mooooo.
No garlic bread for Mrs Beard?
Those are probably the nicest people i've yet to meet
Completely the wring kind of knife for that haha
Did you just call me a beardling?
Are we ever gonna get a video of you pooping behind the scenes. I wonder how you do it in the toilet????? You must destroy them Porcelain seats.
"Never really been into sharing, though..."   JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
I honestly clicked because I saw this got over 1 million views in a day. Huge ups to you.
It's a shame the handle on the knife was so skinny.   Would have been much more comfortable with a chunky handle on the steak knife.
Hello Adam (Beard) Come to the Albion in Rainham Essex RM13 8SS they do a steak challenge,  chicken wings challenge and a burger challenge. I think that you could smash all 3 in 1 sitting
Nice one you destroyed that lovely succulent juicy delicious flavoursome beautiful steak faster than a great white shark great job right in now of to my butcher to get a big steak see what you done and make what you had only smaller yummy for my taste buds and tummy gonna give me a beef buzz wheeeee🍽️👍😛✌️
'Occlude'?! Hark at you! 😀
Ooohhhh just look at it just LOOK AT IT I hear that steak calling me eat me eat me I'm so delicious and you know you wanna🍴🍽️🍖
Seems like he's the best more than Randy Santel right???
Don't here to hate but I think that this much food is just wasted If one person eating it. Makes 0 sense to me.
yeahh clean berd i can watch``
Love the videos
Your commentary makes it.
At first I thought you said the wanked Hart. Disturbing name for a pub
the bed pan is what you was asking about not so common to see in use now days
Adam you should invest in a electric carver for big stakes the time for cutting would be reduced a lot
Wow…
This just.... can't physically be possible! NO!!!!!
who the fuck gives a butter knife to cut steak
I like a steak., but you my friend are something else I tell ya.
Beard slayed the Bull!  BEARD RULES!
'on to the fungus' LOL
How are you a cave man if you’re eating with your hands mate ? Lol it’s natural 😂😂😂 enjoy .
Eat the fat! It’s the best part
“Greetings Beardlings” BRILLIANT 🤩😂🤣😂👊💥
"..abandoned fork and knife.. going full caveman" @7:13 This made me chuckle - it wouldn't be a Beard video unless he uses his hands to eat! Great job, Beard!
I bet you go force vomit afterwards.
How long does it take you to digest a meal like that? How do you stay skinny-ish after eating so many calories?
That was exertion sweat from cutting a tough cut with a butter knife!🤣
congrats on 2 mil
I love your videos even your meat based ones and I’m a veggie.
2 million soon :D
Mate I take my hat off to you, never seen anything like it a true LEGEND
That's not a steak it's a bloody roast, haha, just needed some Yorkshire pudding and gravy on the side.
If you work in hospitality do not wear thongs.
ever since i watched 1 of your videos, i've been watching everything. these vids are just too good and for some reason satifsying to me, ye dont ask me lol.
We're the hell did u put all that food unbelievable 🤣😂😂 well done,👍👍
Dipping the 'foliage' (lol) in bbq sauce was a bit weird.
Swear this man has hollow legs 🦵
"Beardlings" 🤣
The way you goof on yourself makes me know you are a nice guy even off camera. Love your videos
There have been several I knew I could not do. This one beats them by quite a bit. I actually really enjoy the fat too lol.
Half of the challenge looks to be cutting the steak with a bread knife 🤣
Steak was over cooked...
4:093 Didn't you fuck that up? He said as a pair you get 45mins and solo you get an hour. Here Beard says 30 mins as a pair and 45 solo
100 ounces of round steak… jaws must be made of iron.  Also, there is no store in which that piece of meat would be called a steak.  That is a roast.
I've figured out how you do it...you have no internal organs.
How does Beard eat all these unbelievable amounts and yet he still looks like the fittest bloke at gym?!
Amazing absolutely smashed it 👍
This  looks dangerous
"Its a lot of meat" - thats what she said 🤣🤣
Hey Mr.Beard. Watching you eat these delicious looking dishes and desserts got  me wondering.  Do you eat anything else or how do you eat when the camera is not rolling.  Lots of stuff you eat seem so great that I would, at least occasionally, like to savour some of it?
next time please show the meat side of the giant steak so we can see how well it's cooked .
Beast!  Respect!
What was the steak cut?
Man completed a solo with under duo timer . Legend
Awesome
this guy is one of the best big eaters out there . always playing clean and leaves room for dessert . well 99% of the time . next stop the happy colon
Almost 2000000beardlings
Im amazed every time the beard eats he demolishes everything i can barely eat a 20oz steak and he just killed a 100oz steak the stomach is an amazing organ to be able to hold all that food and not wanna barf it all up. Love the vids cant wait for the next one
You should tell people that you are allergic to mushrooms 😉 and that brass bed pan was not to sleep with like a hot water bottle, but to "iron" the cold sheets before you get into bed.. 🛏️❄️
Dude!!! I didn't realise you were my neck of the woods I'd have totally come down to support. Cracking job as always!!
Your a machine 🤣
Been a fan of your content for quite a while now Adam but I've always wondered what is it that you exactly say at 3:16. I'm supposed to know this by now but I guess better late than never? 🤷🏻‍♂️
I would like to see you just review some food without the fast eating bits :)
Adam, what was the on the buses intro music ...comedy ,,,,and you havnt done a challenge with your sis for ages.
As a solo knitter I feel like I really want to join that knitting group 😂 🧶 🧶 🧶
Been here for years now Beard. And what I do miss the most my brother from across the pond is the daily diet challenges!! There has to be one you haven't done yet!! Or even do a couple Death Row inmate last meals!!!
What an effort, maybe ask for a sharp carving knife from the kitchen on your next steak challenge, save those hand muscles.
Love watching your videos man wished i could do it my self Im Skinny AF  Plus i wish to know if you ever eaten couscous? Could be cool to see a "couscous challenge"
Wow, over 1 mil views in one day - fantastic :)
Have you ever lost a food challenge ever?
I feel good sharp knife would help
Right here it comes..... Ittsssss timeeeeee.. Man I died 😂 😂 😂
mate thats not a steak its a proper fucking roast. Looks to be inside rounds too, so really its a london broil tbh.
I liked the part where he said beef army
ONE MILLION views in one day? That's bonkers! Congratulations...
What is the the point in eating too much food? And why? The biggest, the most? Celebrating eating disorders? Showing countries with food and water problems, thats the way to go? You seem like a very nice and kind person, you could make your way with other contend , I belive.
Your a true champion
The fat's the best bit😁
Still can't figure out why you bring nothing with you. Like a super sharp decent size wusthof knife would have made cutting it up pretty easy. Great job as always. Still can't figure out how a human can do that.
This is the first “ challenge “ I watched were I think you struggled a bit 😱but absolutely brilliant dude 👏 well done
Im new to this channel,does he tip even tho he gets the food for free?
How come you don’t bring your own utensils like a good knife or even an electric knife?
Big up Norfolk!
I have a feeling we basically watch this guys entire diet in a video log essentially lol
As soon as you cut into steak the time starts...eat with bare hands without cutting until done?
Rare with steak sauce like HP
That huge steak
Looks like your using a table knife to cut that meat... no steak knife? Good effort though, reminds me of The Great Outdoors film 😃
What does he actually say when he gets right into the commentary? EEESSSHTOOOOYAAA
Whatbis is about the DOGGO MENU? Are their serving dog meat?
You should bring a battery powered electric knife with you on these steak challenges.
Pretty sure it's bad luck for a chef or anyone to leave a utensil stuck in a piece of food like that...
imagine the humongous bowel movement after that thing going thru and hitting his rectum
That would’ve been disappointing seeing that the fat isn’t even rendered.
Am I the only one that feels bad for this fools toilet?
They couldn't have given you a better knife?  Jesus.  A butter knife?
DAM YOU CHEESECAKE HATERS!!!
Looks like Adam is going to pass 2 million subscribers tonight. Congratulations!
Channel must be doing well? Tesla and all 😁
All I can think of is all the meat stuck between the teeth being soooo uncomfortable
Wasn't it solo 60min duo 45 🤔
Freaking BEAST.
BMF for sure
Yes breed knitting
Congratulations
Leave the fat ?, that's the best bit !.
I like the yellow fat.
Great people. Loved the knitting club
Living the dream
I think you mean 60 for solo
Men should not be allowed to wear flip flops
Fear the Beard!!!!
SIMPLY AMAZING
Sooooo the fat is the best part of the steak
You need to get sponsored by dalstrong knives and just carry a super sharp knife wherever you go, lol. Would make those huge steaks alot easier.
A butter knife to cut a steak? Me being from Texas thats just too strange. Which steak was better the Texas steak (which is just down the road from me) or this one?
Well I certainly hope he's taking it easy after eating THAT alone. Probably enough to give him one bad upset stomach.
The fat looked so tasty
👏👏👏👏👏
Damn Beard, that's impressive.
SUBBED! 👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
No steak knife?!? Hard work indeed
Should have went full caveman on the meat sooner on. Decorum has no place on this channel ;)
I can only imagine how rewarding it must feel for both Beard and the Chef’s when he asks for dessert after a challenge
Awesome video sharing
Skip to 2:15 to avoid the BS
You are not a normal human been bro…
This guy never disappoints
I'm getting The Great Outdoors ol' 96er memory.  Lol
Which part of Europe is that? That steak look betto than the one in the US. Think it was the 80oz' er. Plus great side dishes.
can we buy this guy a new accent!!
Your going to need Diet Coke!
Man, that was a big steak
I don't get it? - what am I missing? You gulp down a meal that you obviously are not enjoying because of the manor you have to eat it in and the prize is ----- The meal that made you want to barf is FREE? I think I would rather pay and enjoy instead?
That is a criminal amount of delicious salty rind gone to waste. I'd have taken it home in some foil to chew  away at as a bedtime snack.
The two ladies that walked in to knit were adorable! 🥺
Beardlings ... xD
Now eat 2.5 of these to beat the Simpsons challenge, a 16 pound steak the size of a boogie board.
You gotta try the food challenge in Niagara falls at my cousin's restaurant called M. T. Bellie's (pronounced "empty belly's") it's a huge burger with chips and they sing ya a song before you eat it, they also used to serve it on a trash can lid but not anymore unfortunately, really enjoy your videos! Cheers!
Love your videos man, thanks for entertaining us, you’re my second favorite thing to come out of Leeds next to James Milner!!!
Greetings, fellow beardlings.                 🖖👽🍴🍖     Take me, to your feeder.
They would.put hot coals in and slide around under blankets so you could climb into a warm bed like a hot towel treatment
Do they have steak 🔪  cutting it with a butter knife
Did he cut through the entire steak with a butter knife?!
Where is the catch phrase before you start eating? Why don’t you do it anymore?
2mil coming in…
Poor toilet!
These people were so sweet. Such a wholsome video. Congrats Adam !
My man still got room for the dessert, what a legend
Even The bearded wonder can get the meat swets 😆
Such nice people in this place!
g'day from Australia Adam, i felt ill at the thought of having to eat all that fat until you said you didn't have to.. that was indeed a bed warmer to your right behind you, it was used to take the chill out of the bed but was not left in the bed unattended, it would have been used on the whole familys beds sequentially, before the coals would probably have been emptied back into the fire much like a clothes iron on clothing, it would have been in a bed quite breifly.
The smiling baby is the best part of this video.
I need answers man. Where does all this food go? And do you usually not eat anymore after a challenge for how long? How long do you sit on the toilet in the morning? Do you fast before you take on a challenge? MY CURIOSITY CANT HANDLE THE QUESTIONS
The fat on that steak looked AMAZING! Love me some crunchy, rich fat. Yum!
the chocolate cake sent u in a trance lmao
Nice! Working in a restaurant wearing flip flops. Gross 🤮😂🙏☘️
They could have at least had a t shirt made up for you and sent it on later.  Smashing the two person challenge solo with time to spare.
The only babies you should be eating is JELLY BABIES, no cannibalism on this show Beard. 😂😂
After you say “Here it comes”……what do you actually say at the start of the video, in that crazy voice, I’ve always wanted to know? 😂
When you use a "Bed Warmer" you fill it with coals but you don’t leave it in the bed! You just use it to warm the sheets and such.
There should be a contest where one of your fans gets to come watch you complete one of these challenges! I’d love that ! One thing to see it online probably 10x more impressive in person
You're a mad lad
That knife was a setup!
You should try eating the four horsemeals of the eggporkalypse from parks & rec
Wasn’t sure you were going to ask for the dessert menu after the shrooms….. then you FULLY REDEEMED YOURSELF!!!! I’ll catch ya on the next one!
You missed your chance there Adam. He said the timer doesn't start until you cut into the steak. Technically you could have eaten the sides first and only started the clock with just the steak left.
100 ounces, no small feat -- no mate.  says right there on the sign it's rump steak
I’ll be honest Mr beard That was impressive. Well done.
watching steak challenges hurts my jaw
Shame they gave you a butter knife to cut the steak with.
Do you poop coils of garden hose? What an amazing channel.
Why do you point the camera down when in public outside of america but when you in america you just point it at everyone?
So after eating a baby.. Are you up for going back to the Northampton area ( you did Milton keynes) and try the breakfast challenge at the Pump House "cafe " Wellingborough.. by the way the Mrs was the the one that asked you a couple of years ago if you would add the calorie value of your challenges . Always loving the content.
@BeardMeatsFood many years ago i did a 32oz steak at a pub local to where i live, there was no prize or anything but i must say, i felt like i was going to die for the next 2 days and i never wanted to eat again :D :D so well done on your feat
Incredible
Try attempting Goku's meal
hey beard! what a legend, huge fan, but at 8:45 you mention the women talking about textiles so "persiveresly" i know thats not correct.... which leads me to this comment, was trying to search the meaning up while kinda guessing what it meant. but can you or anyone enlightening me into what you said and its meaning....
Where is Mrs beard she could cut it for you and she's adorable also you got this
I’m getting the meat sweats just watching this.
Coming soon, Beard meets knitting!
Why is he  cutting the steak with a little knife? Looks almost like a butter knife 🤣. That's how they get ya! Imagine how fast he would have done, if he had a nice sharp steak knife from the start! Great Job Adam! 😃 👍.
Savage
This was funny! 😆
Dude that was herculean. You still got it. But is it  traditional for meals over there to have mushrooms or is everyone trying to stump you. Gooo Beard
Was there no steak knife?
i wonder what he does after he eats all this food, ild be sick and workout and eat some healthy food because holy..
Omg he was in my hometown and I missed him
Omg dude if I knew you was in my town I would of come and have watched and said hi
I'd love a video on how you stay in shape.
Great job! Champion! Have you ever considered doing a spin off channel called "toilets I've ruined"?
what i would like to know is how is your cholesterol level? seriously.
that's over 2.8kg!  you're not beard meats food, you're beast meats food!
The guy said an hour for one person 45mins for a team.
WOW, just WOW.  First time viewer SUBBED!  You're an absolute unit, mate!
Bro I live near there 😳😳
I thought they name was The Wanked Hart. 😂
yas beard, smashing shit up once again, legend.
Love ya beard amazing content as always please keep ‘‘em coming
The fat is the best part though...
Wheres the steak knife my anxiety was to the roof
The title looked like 1000 ozer which blew my mind for a few seconds
Congratulations Mr Beardsley, I live in Norwich which is near Swaffham
I looked up vociferous. Word of the day.
“Just the onion rings to go” Tshirt slogan 😅
A sustainable weight for a viable baby. Served with your choice of fries or onion rings.
Loved the look to camera at the mention of ‘anal’ 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Who's that utter beast lady from the states, weighs about 4 stone, molly something. She'd probably do this in 5 minutes. That rind mind, on a grill, bit of pepper, bit of cheese... I'm hungry now.
GO YOU STEADY BORR
Almost 2 mil!
The relaying of stats in this video was a complete mess 😂  We had a time of 35 minutes for a pair. 45 minutes for a pair. 30 minutes for a pair. We had 4 pairs have completed it when the guy said 3 and I’m sure there was something else I’m forgetting
Should of got Mrs.Beard or even better...sister Beard to "help" you out. I use help loosely, as we all know you're the f**King Beard.
Beard! wheres the notification squad at! I live just under an hour away from Swaffham, would of love to come and spectate! please say you're back in Norfolk soon ?:D
That steak knife does not seem worthy to tackle a beast of that size...
My mum lives here I’m so doing this
Your challenges are always insane but this one is on another level!
😲 that's awesome 💯
I love Breadmeatsfood !
but can you eat the Chicago bean? Great videos 10/10!
At around the 4th minute believe you got the challenge wrong. The guy in the restaurant initially said, 60mins if solo and 45 if its two people. Not 30 and 45
‘Beardlings’, that floored me! 🤣🤣🤣
A man after my own heart, but sadly I am a man with limitations.
No you're not done . yet. U have to eat the fat....lol...the 👍   The great outdoors....
Randy would have eaten gristle lol
Eh I thought you got 45 minutes for two that try it and an hour if you try it on your own.  I'm sure Adam said 30 minutes and 45 minutes lol.
LOVE
Why didn't you just ask for a sharper bigger knife from the kitchen?
I weep for your poor colon, Beard Man.  That was a metric ton of meat.
Would have been easier to cut if they gave you an actual steak knife not a butter knife
what DOES he infact say
legend says, this man has never paid for a meal
Adam aint human he is the terminator t-999999999
You're a lunatic 😂, well done old china
Love the raised eyebrow at the end as well as the 'Carry On' double entendre at the start,  typical Beard :)
I bet this keeps you full for the rest of the week.
tthey need to work on the lights in that reastaurant
Why does every steak in Britain look dry AF?
You said you only had 45 but they said 1 hour.  But good job.
Pure awesomeness! 👏👏👏👏👏
You got Alltwen numbers wrong on the voice over lol. Both the times to complete and rhe number of pairs to have completed it.
That was a beast  🥩
Soz to be THAT person... but 100oz steak is equivalent to driving for 1,369 (nice) miles.  434kg of co2.
When I first showed my gf these videos and she heard the "eeeisshuuurrrggh" she legit almost pissed herself
Best commentary yet
and they give you a butter knife to cut the steak??? been watching you for a long time. might have missed it. but, have you ever got sick during a challenge and had to quit or got disqualified?
I always enjoy their reaction when you ask what they have for desert.
You’d put the bed warmer in the bed before you went to bed and then remove it when you were ready to go to bed. You didn’t sleep in the bed with the bed warmer in it lol
Top g
I think you need to stop trying to explain the challenge multiple time cause you screw it up a little more every time you do it lol
Oh my golly gosh. You are awesome 👏🏻  The hand cramps were real  😫- ouch 😣😣
You must shit like Randy from Southpark the day after these challenges.
Beard you need to invest in an electric meat slicer 😂😂 great video mate 👍🏻
A surprisingly entertaining and, strangely enough, wholesome video! The atmosphere really added to it and you also seem like quite a nice bloke yourself. Keep up the great work, man!
M8, do you even buy food or do you just eat challenges for free?:D
nou that is steak
The foodgasm when you took the bite of the cake😂🤌🏽
I can see the pain while eating Dessert  in this video  😁
Fat Is the best bit
When does a steak become a roast?
2 people get 45mins 1 person gets an hour...? Seems Fair lol
OOOOOOOOOSHHHHH TUUUUUUYYAAAAARRRRR!!!!!! What a legend
Would love you to enter a few eating comps that would be great!!
Great staff and the Knitters !!! Nuts
Hats of mate, bloody great job
That was a painful one to watch your jaw must have felt like dropping off, the bearded beast does it again, Legend
Make no misteak that was an A1 job!
Wow 😳 well I honestly didn’t think you was going to do it wow wow wow 👏🏻👏🏻 plus desserts 😆 you now have a new subscriber here 👍🏻 well done to you 🥳👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Why no steak knife?  Was the butter knife part of the challenge???
Large up the Swaffham knitting crew
recently introduced my girlfriend to the channel and now she's obsessed 😂 big win
That baby was too cute
I've had 40 ounces once I don't know how you did 100
What a beast you are, smashed it
Need a proper steak knike rather than that butter knife :)
aplause for being crazy, nice
33rd most trending vid in the world, love your videos beard, forever wishing you all the success and happiness in the world :)
Please someone make a meme out of 11:30
Aw, I'm a beardling 🤗 Thanks Beard!
I'm so gutted you finally came to literally 30 minutes from me I would have loved to come and meet you and cheer u on . Another top quality video and very well done again still smashing it 👏
I feel bad for mr Beard's toilet back at home. He must've taken a lot of shit over the years, literally.
Yo, my knitters, what up!
I guess it's insecurity issues or whatever,  but with these type of channels I want to see before and after pics of their bellies.
It pains me to see the steaks cooked that way
Dude you should bring your own badass knife its Aloud
Norfolk Math! 1 Person 1 hour. Two people 45 minutes 🤷‍♂️
Oh wow. Lived in Swaffham for 5 years! Only once visited the White Hart, only place open a few days after lockdown!
I just found your channel pretty recently, so I’m still catching up and enjoying a lot of your older videos, but this has got to be the most impressive one I’ve seen! You’re a monster, dude haha I love you
How did yo manage to narrate the challenge times wrong when they were just on the video? Well done though, that was a serious amount of meat for one sitting. 🧔‍♂
The knife was a serrated butter knife haahaha. They should've given you a steak knife
Wow! That was a HUGE steak. Great job. 👍
What kind of sauce is that?
Why in the world would you ever cut the fat off that steak   that's where the flavor is that's why people eat ribeyes and wagu. The fat is where it's at that was heartbreaking watching that lol.
This is so bizarre. I went to college in Swaffham, never thought I'd see you there 🤣
Was it intentionally well done?
The steaks were high on this one
Has anyone asked him isn't he worried about how much hair from his mustache he ate while having the meals? You know that people with such facial hair unintentionally tend to eat some hair while eating their meal.
Next time, ask if they have a big bread knife for you, hahaha. The staff seemed so nice and awesome here!
Lol where the hell did you find that music. Could be off a benny hill sketch
OMG ! 😷
i'd get a rump for my dog. not neccesarily for me tho. not posh, just spoiling the eff out of our dogs. come to think of it this small cow can eat nearly as much steak in one sitting as i can, and she's under a quarter of my weight. can loan her out for team challenges :)
I love the way you take a bite of the cake after finishing a challenge.  Surprised you didn't eat the fork too! Good work beard!
Watch out Mrs. Beard, he chatting up charming older ladies and wanting to knit,  kinky so and so...
The music at the beginning made me feel like I was in a delicious episode of Terry and June.
And this is something to be proud of? Oh well, it shows how far society has sunk.
You Sir can, with honest say -"I Know what it feels like to give birth"
I just worry about the harm you may be doing to yourself.
I think you should take a real steak knife with you. Is that a butter knife? Is it even serrated? Crazy!
The bedpan is removed before you get in the bed.
Impressive 😮🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
💯💪💪💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
You absolute beast sir 👍
You should have dunked the mushrooms in the BBQ sauce
A whole baby!
Spot on..
No Steak knife ?
WOW that was impressive!
Damn good show Beard. Gutted I missed you. Cycled through Swaffham and had a quick cheeky beer there, a couple of days ago! Keep up the good work lad 😁👍🏼👍🏼
They could have given you a better knife.
Beardlings is my new favorite name😂
This man is a manace 🤣🤣
I actually like a little fat on my steak, adds a little flavor.
what a bloke! Got the times wrong in the narration though. 60 for solo 45 for double.
surprised they don't make it 200oz after Beard ate it solo.
You don’t do colabs because you don’t like sharing 🤣🤣👑
I feel like the sides were fair. I've seen what some of those other places tried to pull.
A proper steak knife would have been nice. As an accomplished carnivore, I usually carry my own knife.
I have always wondered so do the owners want you to win or lose Paradox
No way did you come to where I live 😭😭😭
Good work!
I’ve never seen you struggle so much! Good job mate
Dang it looks like your jaws swollen rest up. 📡👽🇺🇸 RUN!!!
well u actually loose 25 % in weifht when u cook beef so it’s 75 oz
I would of just eaten the fat and leave the meat to you :D Also would take the mushrooms on your beards behalf
Bbbeeeeaaarrrrrddddd!!!  Just thinking man ya musta missed Texas sooooo much as well as the country music ya had to tackle this giant steak challenge.
that looked very tough lol
Rocket should be called choke leaf, and should carry a choke hazard warning.
Bobby Hill would be proud
absolutely disgusting
I love the taste of the fat on the sides
Adam you never fail to surprise me, I should know better but whenever food comes out I think, surely he isn't going to do this one. Brilliant work
give our beard a bigger knife!!!
The collab we didn't know we needed...
I don't know how you do that! Would this be considered gluttony?
lots left to go ,,,?🤣🤣
Missed a trick mate. The guy said the time starts when you cut the steak, eat the sides 1st then the clock won't start 😂😂
Flashbacks to Uncle Buck and John Candy eating the Old 96er.
Giving your stomach more time doesn't increase the capacity 😂
Wow!!!!  I tried the Texan Steak Challenge as I live in Texas.  This makes that look Silly.
I see how they did you Beardo. Giving you a butter knife instead of a real knife to tire your out lol
How do they hand you a 100oz steak and a butter knife?  Should have just pulled out the credit card and used that.  You need to start bringing your own utensils!
This is the world.
I remember being told at school that the average Bison has enough meat to feed a family for a year!  They should have added that beard would strip it to its bones in a week 😂
It needs less vegetables with that meal.
"Not a challenge without chips" Tee shirt idea 😂
How on earth do you fit all of that in your belly without it exploding?  Do you then not eat for several day?  SO  MANY QUESTIONS!!  LOL
Did they give you a butter knife?
Ah man wish I knew you were coming to Swaffham. I live close, would of been cool to see the beard in action! Ha
I could have sworn that the landlord said 45 mins for 2 people & 1 hr for 1 person!
I’m always impressed, but todays success left me amazed. Cheers Adam.
wow.....watching these whilst i'm off work ill, enjoying them all and still amazed how you manage these. Even before i had a gastric bypass at 32 stone i couldn't do any of the big challenges like this. Awesome
@BeardMeatsFood Your stomach must be like a Tardis or something, I used to have hollow legs but mate... you're 100% hollow 😂 I didn't think you'd do this one but to smash it as you did, fair play to you mate.   By the way, you need to get seen by the Chinese/Japanese/Korean lot, they LOVE watching people eat. Some of them would even give you a run for your money!  Great entertainment mate, and great commentary 🙂
how is it possible that you are not obese?=
You should go and try the challenges at The George Pub & Grill in Stockton on Tees. I’m sure they did or do the largest steak challenge in the country. 🤘
Honest question, do you eat many vegetables/fruits off video? Or Take vitamin supplements?
if i ate that much meat il prolly have some gassy problems for some time
The thing behind you, is an early banjo, not quite perfected.
The was huge! Great job Beard!
The Fat on the ends the best bit lol lol
Those onion rings look bussin
You shared a pizza a couple of years ago with an American gentlemen 🍕🍕🤔😁🇬🇧🇬🇧
Good lord
Winners eat the fat
This would have been a good one for sister beard!!   It’s been a hot minute since you guys did a challenge together!   Awesome as always mucka!
This is the only person I’ve seen that uses knife and fork in a eating challenge
How much was it if you didn't finish.  Well done that was awesome
I am new to the channel and wonder why you always separate the meet and the rest of the stuff. Wouldn't it taste better if you ate them together?
You're an absolute machine... How often would you fail a challenge?
Shame about fat that is the flavour
Wow this is insane!!! You are a Freak my guy …. A Jinn … I saw it and still don’t believe it
OOOOOOKEROOOOOO! 😎👍😎
What a wimpy steak knife they gave you
Goooo Beard!!!!
My nan lives just around the corner from the pub.
did it say how much this challenge is? must of missed it
Hey Beard, You need to take your own Big Sharp Steak Knife, to make things easier,, Top Job as always..
Do you edit your own videos Adam? Cuz it’s freakin elite
That was about the size of the roast our family had last Christmas. Have you thought about taking your own sharp knife to steak challenges? It might make the cutting easier.
Why doesn't he eat sides in between?
Mr. Beard does not need a team, just give him a table and watch him demolish this challenge w/record time, great job Mr. Beard, this steak looked amazing!!
Lol so the challenge starts when you cut into the steak a sneaky person would say okay then proced to eat all the sidees first :P Loopholes are everything :)
You win again champ🤗 . We need a bush tucker trail on you tube. 100 cow balls
So finally beard meets meat
you should take your own knife !
Must be hard on your teeth! Like the wearing down the teeth of a buzz-saw! Great vid 👍
Golden always 11:12
damn that looks tasty af
Mate, you need to bring out a map so we can see where all the challenges youve done. would be great for when im out and about to give these a go!
As I was thinking about your video ☺️📸
Well done Beard.
Cutting that beautiful fat off?! Shame on you. Literally the best part
Adam is living proof that you can out train a bad diet! haha. The guy is still jacked!! you make me feel like I can eat anything then when I try and eat a meal I get so full! you make it look too easy!
Legend 👍👍 all Leeds arnt we 💪
Jeez that’s mental… don’t know how you do it🙌
Have you tried filming a challenge with a Francis Bourgeois style GoPro angle?... Could be comedy gold 😀
That piece of fat looked nice and crispy.
"Beard Knits Food" could be a side project for the days when you're not doing eating challenges 😂👍  *I want commission on each challenge if it happens 😂👍
Ur awesome 🤠
How are you not 200kg😂
Good old fashioned Stitch and Bitch.
Nice they gave him a butter knife
I would have eaten some of the fat, but it's not melts fat, it looks like it cooled for too long. Yay! You did it.
I never even considered that when watching these sitting in the AC, no AC in Great Britain in a lot of places, in the summer doing a challenge like that? I feel like I’d have a heat stroke
Just your face eating the cake at the end says how hard this was
Dude - the fat looked great.  You think you know a man...
where is the steak knife? it looks like you are using a butter knife... that's horrible.
The fats the best bit
Where do you get those killer shoes?
Hey Mr Beard and and Mrs Beard- I live in Western Australia and love your channel but guess what- randomly I clicked on your latest video tonight and it’s from Swaffham, Norfolk where I grew up and went to school!! Great to see the White Hart! That’s got to be a big challenge! Hi to everyone In Swaffham from Aus and get to the White Hart for a good feed!! 👍
The desert menu gets me every time. 😀
@0:09 Wait, is that Tijuana Brass? You, sir, are legendary!
Is that well-overdone, Adam?
‘Norfolk-in-chance’, brilliant!
Why are you cutting the steak with a butter knife?
The old ladies were so cute and a good inclusion in the video
Love the music at the start my Bearded brother 🇦🇺
Wake up   Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless
Going by your slender body, you must take the biggest dumps
c'est king kong ce mec !!!!
Its a bed pan...the slave would fill it with hot coals and warm the bed before the master went to bed
Do you have a desert menu 🤣🤣
Wow great video brother keep sharing these type of videos 😍
That round pan behind you was used to heat the bed before you got in , not in there whilst you slept 👍
Terrible cut of MEAT! TOUGH TOUGH TOUGH< CHEW CHEW CHEW....nope.....they shoulda gave you a 4 inch thick prime rib! they couldnt do that thought cuz it would cost 300+ bucks.... Just for the cut of meat....Terrible challenge if you ask me....They're actually asking you to chew 100oz. of cardboard, dry, tough and tasteless hunk of garbage.....they ought to be ashamed,,,
I have no idea why its so fun to watch you, but you just seem like a genuine and good person.  Hope all the best for you in life brother.  Catch you on the next one!
Epic as always - absolute legend.
You should have asked for that slice of fat to be re grilled and rendered down a bit with lots of char on it... Best part of a steak imho.. I'd spend a few minutes cutting it up into small managable bit too..  Sidse were light thoughtfully.... no 1/2 kilo of fries bulking up the challenge..  Well done
These videos make my week 🙃
I already know before I watch this he gonna murder that steak 🥩
You deserve a statue
Another SUPERB video Beard!! It made me feel like I was there with all the interaction with the staff and patrons.  Wish I could fly over there to watch you  do a challenge like that in person - a two person meal done by one in elegant fashion.  Even the knitting club gave a good round of applause when you finished!  Thanks for the smiles!! :)
Never been much about sharing, LOL you are the man!!
Doesnt make sense
thats a roast not a steak
Swaffam is an awesome place.
hes got to be baked right?
OUTSTANDING rofl...😂
Fun to watch ... From Philippines 😘
I used to live in swaffham now living in Lynn ur literally opposite my old flat used to always go to that pub
Holy sh#!t batman, you're a beast!
No that’s 5 mins down the road from me I could of met him 🥲
You have made history again in the finest  way and a conversational starter at the knitting club. X
well done
Can`t remember you called me a Beardling before...Thx very much!
wow you smashed it! Well done! Not touching a single side until the steak was done! 🙈😂
I watched like 20 of your videos now and its honestly estonishing to me how you do not pay for your food and get paid for eating it on top :D Kindest regards from Germany :) First Abo thats no Musik... ;)
damn I want this...
THE STOMACH
Proper Bruce Bogtrotter at the end there
Please have the knitting club in a video where you Take mrs beard along with you & get them to knit her a beard she can wear Lol   Also knitting might be a great hobby for the days after a huge challenge lol just knit while you digest an infant size portion of steak 😂
Enjoyed the knitting Collab joke🤣🤣🤣
I was hungry until I watched this. I think I will watch it again when hungry its too scary
Do you have dinorod on speed dial🤣🤣🤣
Can't wait for the new channel! "BeardMeatsKnitting"
What was the hardest challenge you have ever done?
How about that tiny knife..live seen more intimidating butter knives !
Surprised your not sponsored by andrex.
Mate - you're doing yourself in in these steak challenges! You need to come prepared with a cutting glove and your own steak knife. Get the thing professionally sharpened and take it with you! No more hand cramps and blisters! Great video 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Might be for two people, but I'd be gutted having to share those chips with someone else 😂
Man youre a legend !!!!!!!!!!!
Poor Mrs Beard  no sharing for you
I'm a bit like yourself I like babies but couldn't finish a full one 🤣🤣🤣
Is it still considered a solo attempt if you brought someone along just to cut the meat?
as a butcher i can assure you 100oz of beef is an insane challenge.
I didn't think you would beat this one and I'm sorry about that. I will never doubt the beard again.
Should have eaten the fat!!!! 🤣🤣🤣 John Candy - R.I.P
Now there’s a steak. The only thing I can gobble down like the best.
Wheres the steak knife?? Get a cramp using a butter knife 🤣😅 welldone
They could have given you a proper steak knife!
Way too much meat even for two!
For steak challenges, it might be worth it to get a good pocket knife and to keep it really sharp to help with cutting. Might spare your arms a bit
Can you make a video of the shit you're taking after this?
Your getting phat lol
Bruh the guy litteraly toled you 2 times if your a team you get 45 min and if your solo you get a hour. You start eating and you say you get 30mins if your a team and if your solo 45mins....
Wow 🤩 Mr Beard Never Ceases To Amaze…..
10:36 The raised eyebrow made me laugh  =)
You seem to be getting more applause in the videos lately Mr Beard! You must be moving up in the world 😂 😂 shame mrs beard didn’t make an appearance in this one she’s hilarious! Say hi from us 👋. Another smashed challenge great stuff 👍
As Richard Simmons would say,  my that's a big one.
Wow thats an amazing thing to eat x
Humankind, where is this going
2 people 45min, 1 person 60 minutes..the maths doesn't work for me.
Every grandma on this planet probably loves you :)
I worry about your health, I guess you have the constitution, be well Sir.
Where is the steak knife...
Norfolk Inn Chance
Reminds me of the Frontier Steak House home of the 6lb challenge in Tampa Florida
The close ups of your face while you polish off the dessert with a sense of satisfaction and pride always make me laugh 😂 in a good way! Massive well done 👌🏻
way to go man!
Gutted the ladies didn't knit you a bib, that would have been amazing 👍👍
Never miss your videos Adam this one was awesome 👌 👏 👍 as always ❤
Amazing video as always. Your humour is amazing!! Love it!!!
You could do with an electric carving knife to hack that steak to pieces , or an electric chainsaw .
50 Kelloggs Rice Crispy Squares?! Impossible!
Quick, someone make a 100oz of mushrooms challenge!
Where does this food go???
But the fat is the best part :(
Give it to me I'll eat the fat. Just had an idea Beef Scratchings!
Elmo couldn’t do that
Well done to you and good luck 🍰☕
I'm a vegan who's a subscriber - if that isn't a compliment to Adam's super nice personality, I don't know what is. Lots of love!
Well done beard
Haha, I got a covid fine in Swaffham after BASE/parachute jumping from an old radar antenna there 😎
Lovin it!
I would have asked for a sharper knife 😵
Did you end up learning anything about knitting?
Absolute beast, brilliant
from all the challenges, which ones are the best sides you could ask for and which the worst? we know mushrooms are the least fav...
the bloke at the start said you had an hour not 45 mins like you said in the voice over
Ffs You must have clogged the toilet the following morning trying to flush a 100oz turd away
Well done beard !!!   Love that you didn't leave the mushrooms till last, instead leaving your favourite to the end.  Legend !
I d love to eat 100 oz steak.. not so much for a challenge.. just I love steak.. lol
How did you have this cooked ... looks dry
At one time, only men could knit, as in it was illegal for women to knit.  I cross stitch while I watch your challenges.
Meant for teams of 2: 45 min He attempted solo: 60 min He finished it in 38 min, at least make it look difficult 😅
!!JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!! 😂
Next time bring an electric knife.
It makes me laugh so hard when he eats his first bite of dessert cause he looks like he's having an orgasm while falling asleep! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Why do you never include the name of the place, it's location and name of the challenge in the video description?
How much calories can you eat under 24 hours? You can go on toilett and take breaks under the day and sleep. From breakfrost to breakfrost.
Oh man, the fat is where the flavor is ;)
Could have sworn the bloke said pairs get 45 minutes and solo gets 60 minutes
Holy….. well done, well freaking done! Bet you went home to couch potato and digest 😝
The fat is the best part. 👌
R. I P YOUNG MAN 👨
typical yorkshire  "  YER GOT THE SIDES ON TOP " :)
And it was really fairbon the sides....not a little bit of meat sitting on 10kg of fried potatoes
Norfolk Enchants 👌🤣
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍 Outstanding
Adam just loves handling meat with his hands. Another great video and surprised you didnt get lock jaw over all the chewing.. XD
Gotta say that looks like an INCREDIBLE steak!!!
I read the comments here continually and always come to the same conclusion which is how can you eat so much in the name of appeasing ego whilst so many starve in the UK and abroad 🤔 With global food shortages affecting billions of people maybe some food re distribution would get you more likes , it's not a pop it's just logic 👍
Haha I love the standard beard photo pose 😄👍🏼
That collab joke is what got me that was funny af
You came to Norfolk and didn't tell me. I hate you Beard. I will find you.🤪🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️✌️👊
Could you go sub 30 on that if you needed to?
Where do u put it all this one gets a wow
I don't know how I feel about 'Beardlings' lol
The One time I’ve seen him not wanting that desert looool ahaha
You could probably knit a jumper from your Beard!! Ok it would be Itch but still.👍
You got the times wrong in your commentary. It's 35 for a team for 2 or an hour for 1 person the guy said at the start.
@beard  which one is worse, soggy chips or fungus
send me them Big pieces of Fat to my student accommodation in Leeds
Honestly, you're the best! Keep doing what you do! Still listening to escape the fate?
That's what I call a piece of meat  :)
It looks burned...oh, it's a bit better in the middle. I bet that is hard on the jaw. Of course, I like my steak rare, so anything past that looks burned to me.
great vid. u got the times wrong thou... they said in the beginning that it was 45 for 2 ppl, and 60 for one
Hi, Not do with this video but reheating food is not cheating its smart. new Fan from Downunder  (Don't hold that against me😁 )
I would've eaten the fat
You left the best bit ! Fat looked good !
What is it you say in the strange voice in all your videos?
Is there anything in the rules,that says you can't have someone cutting the meat for you?
Dude no steak knife, that must be a part of he challange also
Love the anal eyebrow, so childish, so had to be done.
Pity the steak was so over cooked (surely a rarer steak would be easier to eat).
You need an electric knife for the big meat challenges.
I just saw a guy who looks like Groot from Minions walk by as you took the last bite.
There's something slightly fascinating and yet at the same time oddly disturbing about these videos. The mind boggles!
Well done Adam you are the man. 🥩🥩🥩🥩
That steak looks very...grey. Did you order well done again after saying it was a mistake the last time in Texas? All this time is that beard just there to cover your weird, oversize pit bull jaws?
I want to send this to Tzuyang!!!
Beards digestive enzymes could be harvested to break down the oceans plastics within 24 hours 😬
The real challenge was cutting that whole steak with a butter knife.
Whenever you eat a steak,  I always think of that scene in The Great Outdoors, where John Candy was attempting that steak challenge.  xD
The close up dessert shot gets me every time 🤣
That look from Adam when the waiter says 'anal'. Hilarious.
2.8kg of steak ……
Eat the meats!
Fred Flintstone with his Brontosaurus Steak.🥩
Imagine the jaw ache after eating that! 😀
As if you didn't eat the fat rind one of the best bits ?
Adam your narration was wrong, you said if you try as a double you get 30 minutes and as a solo you get 45, it was as a dual you get 45 and solo you get 1 hour
Doesn't  your  jaw start  hurting  after  chewing  that  much  stake?
You don't leave the bed warmer in the bed. You fold back the blankets, and rub it on the sheets. Put the blankets and warmer back, then climb into bed.
What? No mountain of fries? Just a normal portion? 🙃🤔😮 🤣🤣
No steak knife 🤦🏻‍♂️
I believe those pans were made to put in before you get into bed to get them heated up and removed when you are about to sleep.
Cercon collider, eat my hat ! THIS man has the biggest black hole...food just ...dissapears !
You always look so creepy at the end taking your first bite of the dessert 😂😂😂
beardlings LOL
Your choice of music and the way you muffle it as soon as you switch to the car shot always gets me. Lovely attention to detail. The look to the camera when the guy said "anal"
What did they do to the steak, looks like they left it in the oven to long! You didn't ask for it medium well did u Adam? X
Only found out about your channel a week or 2 ago, boy have I been watching your videos :D Love the content!
Nice to see you do a challenge down this corner of the UK, was also refreshing that the staff knew who you was and didn't triple the amount of sides 👌
On your own 1hr or 2 persons 45 mins, that actually makes no sense
I would have ate the fat in a pairs challenge in a hot moment, that's the best part of steak for me.
Beard Meets Knitters Challenge.........
the fat is the best part
You literally are a caveman bro. Entertainment though. Absolute machine 💪👊👍
i love this channel because this is like my favorite show Man vs Food but with a real vibe to eat. I love how wholesome these videos are and I am very surprised on the amount of challenges you can do!
iamgine if they gave you a legit knife to cut that!  Also surprised you didn't just mand handle it from the beginning
those ladies seemed so lovely
Thanks god he’s not a cannibal 😂
You should knit beards for those who have none 😂
New channel idea, "BeardKnitsWool"
Jesus... The desert reaction always a classic!!!
A proper steak knife with a smooth blade would have saved you a lot of hard work.
Your just not human mate😂 absolutely unbelievable effort! Love your videos honestly👍🏻👍🏻💪🏻
3kg of steak! Outstanding 😳👍😎
What a steak.. and lovely people.. well done , as always. 😀
Do you ever lose challenges? and if so you should post em
I swear mushrooms are  there to slow you down. Some day it will be just solely mushrooms challenge.
Outstanding!  But Beard, that’s a few weeks now where we haven’t had a “Let’s Gedeeeetttt!!!!” ahead  of the challenge. Where has it gone?
people say I don't do collabs😂😁😂....onto the fungus😂😂.....always a blast watching these videos.....Kenya ?🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰 🇪 in the building
Desert menu is proper boring now.
First time I've seen you actually look full!
that makes sense? no it doesnt 2 should be 30 mins lol
Fuck Texas hahaha
YOU SHOULD DO A CHEESE CAKE CHALLENGE 🎂
Your a pure machine mate when it comes to eating, respect when respects due 👏
Do they give you a butter knife lmao is knife violence that bad there
Dudes are running are shitshow, needa drop the fat weight for fries weight 🙌
Beard... HOW?????? well done dude, some solid skills there... Great Video man...
You have over 20k views the chances of your partner reading this is low. However I’d like to know the strategies you’ve implemented to monetise this because there’s a few areas that you could improve your margins. All the best.
Do you ever suffer during the dessert, after eating an ungodly amount of food
The fact they gave you that big of a steak with a butter knife is comical
Wtf, doesnt that fucken hurt man.. My asshole is feelin' it from here, yeesh.
The lady’s behind you were priceless 😊
You know you're in Norfolk when you have a knitting group in your local. Proud norfolk girl here
Need plenty of lube to get it down, and out 🤣
they really didn't give you a steak knife? cutting it with a butter knife is part of the challenge I guess
Signature have you got a dessert 😂 watching the video in the kitchen 🤣
Awesome job
There you go for your next series, Beard meets Knitting!!!🤣
Now that’s called a steak!!! These restauranteurs were fantastic. They really enjoy people taking on this challenge and even genuinely want people to finish. Glad there wasn’t too many sides and pounds upon pounds of chips.
What a legend sir, awesome job, think my hands would of cramped up , well done mate.
So close to 2mil subs mate ,Well done on this challenge,this one was definitely hard Yakka mate 😊😊 support from 🇦🇺 🇦🇺  😁😁
32.00  he wiped his beard for the first time 😂
As they say on Norfolk - “Proper Job”. Well done.
It wasn’t the warmest welcome from the First Lady
Legend 👍
You’re a mad man
Well done, mate!
Jesus you are a machine lol
Have you had your cholesterol tested? 🤣
Way to go
What a great venue.
❤️❤️❤️❤️🖤🖤🖤🖤
This was legit nuts !
bro that steak looks aggressively dry lol I almost choked just watching this.
Nice Ole ladies. I'd also recommend this restaurant for you! (Although I'm in NZ) lol. Relaxed atmosphere lovely staff aad they seeme very accommodating. My kind of place. Thanks for sharing!
You can start a new channel...Beard Knits Food!
First rule of Knitting Club: You do not talk about Knitting Club.....
The fats the best bit !
Boohoo "my fingers hurt" man up Beard!
Amazing!
to be fair there was a rocket leaf left in the sauce  🤣🤣🤣
i always like it when you go to a place with super nice people, those interactions really add something lovely to the episode!
That looked so hard. And you worked so feverishly, your arm was tired. But you sure did beat that meat!
The item propped up behind you is indeed a warming pan. Used to warm up  a bed with coals from the fire, but you'd remove it before you actually got into bed. :)
The fact you did it fast enough to qualify for a pair... Good lord.
My partner and I enjoy watching your vids mate. Try everything in the menu of Jollibee fast food. I’m sure all of your filipino fans would be thrilled 🫶
That looked like a pound of fat and gristle.
I can't believe the restaurant gave him a butter knife ice instead of a steak knife.. no wonder his arms hurt they really could have gave him a steak knife but whatever beardmeatsfood still devoured the challenge per usual.
Such hospitable staff. That meal looks quality too.
I'm disappointed in how few pairs have accomplished this, I've eaten a 3lbs steak by myself before and I have a half dozen people I know can do the same.  But solo, I don't think I could do 6 lbs myself good lord.
Well done! I'm surprised you didn't just get in and use your hands for the steak from the start. Love your vids always great to watch.
I bet that hurts coming back up
bbq on a steak? eww come on use A1 at least or Worcestershire
Congrats From Fresno California.........it will be a pleasure if I can get a like from you Mr Beard...pkeaseeeeeeeeee
ofc the human baby eating comment at the end  THEY LIVE
That steak looked amazing.
jw why do they give 45 minutes for pairs instead of just halving the time for 1 person ? i feel like if anything the solo attempter should get the slightly more time
thats dinky, making my mouth water nom nom nom, fat too, yummy
Why is the Diet Coke tactical???
I don't know whats more impressive eating that much steak or cutting through that much steak with a butter knife
That’s the best vid so far. Great work Beard.
“You’re definitely going to need some sudocrem on those fingers in the morning” and plenty on your arse I’d say!!
Always entertaining, great vid, thanks
You gotta start bringing your own knife 🤣 Need a super duper sharp one cuz that looked exhausting
Did u learn how to knit
To me fat on meat is the king of flavour.....
y do u always sound like ur there to rob the place when u enter and talk to people
Sorry but that meat looks like a huge roast,,,,NOT. Steak,,, must be a uk thing???,,, that is not a steak
Great job, but that looks absolutely disgusting.
Dam I love your channel. Great Shoes by the way. Box on Bearded one. Chomp Chomp Chomp.....
Well done.  That's tough
Mad Lad
New respect.
That steak looks like it was killed twice. Overcooked and tough as old boots. Yuck. Lol
Man, how did you not get stomach cramps from all that meat?
You needed a proper steak knife....
Respect as usual man 💜
Why doesn't he alternate between foods? Why eat every part one by one?
Have you thought about using plastic gloves particularly on messy foods?
I'd suggest taking your own steak knife, a large one you could basicly saw the steak.
Of cause your hands will hurt using a f. Butterknife. A good, sharp Knife will help enorme and also makes chewing more easy.
He just KEEPs on eating. I know people joke about “where does it go”. But some kind of study, while he is eating would be nice. I would enjoy knowing how he does it. Where does it go? How much does his stomach change? What was his stomach before? Etc.
What lovely people there
Champ
That was a great looking steak. I had my doubts on this one and was surprised how you managed in the end. Keep up the good work, your videos are always great fun.
The object in the back looks like one of those long handled campfire or brick oven popcorn poppers to me xD
Just scrolling through youtube and saw this. Watched the whole thing and am thoroughly impressed lol. Although I hope that vegan teacher never finds this channel 🤣 it would do her in big time lmao. Great video! 🤗
Can we get a you vs joel!?!?! Like that would be amazing..beyond amazing..you guys would clean a restaraunt out in minutes
At least this time no one will wonder about how you get your protein in when doing challenges
My jaws hurt just watching him chew.
Congratulations ❤️
You done really well. Rump steak is very really tender usually a tough cut so well done 👌
They could have given you a steak knife
Are real knives illegal in Britain or wot?
K this one deserves a follow up video, cause man o man this seems like it would have just wrecked your entire life for the next 36 hours. On another note, did you feel the need to seek medical attention after doing this?!
Butter knife for a steak challenge
You're awesome sir, I love STEAK, but you keep finding BEYOND STEAK!!
My jaw hurt just watching this... Yeesh Adam.
One issue I see, they should've given you a steak knife. That butter knife ain't cutting it... Haha
They could of gotten u a better knife
Wow I just found your channel.  Hell yeah man.
Outstanding vid m8
am I losing my mind or did you get every number wrong when reviewing the challenge lol.  wasnt it 45 mins for pair and 60 for you? and 3 pairs successful not 4?
when it arrived I thought "oh no, our hero is done for" and then.............our hero turned into a legend.
They'll teach you how to knit, you'll teach them how to eat a 100oz steak
💪💪💪
how are you doing ..? Youre doing alright huh ?
In germany there is a restaurant called waldgeist which has a 3kg (6pounds) schnitzel challenge which also includes 2 pounds of fries and a salad. Should you want they have buckets of bacardi coke (12liters)
Funny the staff was expecting the desert menu line. 🤣🤣 The knitting ladies were cool too, they clapped when you finished, they could’ve knitted you a beard cozy. 😂
those ladies were lovely
Niggas always trying to add some nasty ass mushrooms to something
Nice one Beard
Great job beard! Just a heads up you goofed the challenge time in the description.
I guess not bringing a “kit” along is part of his style, but bringing a proper knife would have been a big help
Hi Adam, I watch quite a bit of food challenges......your vids is my favourite without a doubt! Send me a pair of your shoes 🙂Greetings from South Africa....and to Mrs Beard ;-). Time for you to visit SA and do a proper Carnivore challenge, you let me know and we will make it happen
The gristle is where the flavor is!!!!
100% of the people that have tried this solo have succeeded
Theres nothing quite like that angle on the post challenge dessert clips. @ 11:28
You're a beast
Wow that was the closest I've ever seen him get to the time limit
You are actually insane my man ! Definitely a bit high five for this one.
Joking about eating babies to a mother holding her newborn… not the smartest move, Beard.
That look at theme end when you were eating that chocolate cake and cream....lol I know that look!
Sustainable weight of a viable baby!  Way to go bro! A grim , yet achievable challenge!
You have problems man.
"60 minutes for one person, 45 minutes for two people" "Oh, that makes sense..."
Oh my God I want that steak. Now I am hungry.
Wrong, two people has 45 min one has 60 min. He said it in the beginning and said we will leave you for a hour...
Very impressive!
100 ounces is 2.8 kg for anyone wondering
absolute beast !  i always laugh when you ask "do you have a dessert menu" ? 😂
Oh man you know it's rough when he isn't complaining about the shrooms
You’re a God
Me: I’m so hungry I could eat a whole cow Beard: here hold my camera watch this!!!  Question what was the most memorable challenge that was the toughest to get through keep up the vids man we love it!!!
You can do it . WHAT EAT BRO. keep up the good in the world one day at a time world Peace always World wishing for Knowledge
The meat seemed undercooked
THIS CHALLENGE REMINDS ME OF ONE OF THE GREAT JOHN CANDY MOVIES “The great outdoors” ALSO STARRING THE GREAT DAN AKYROD.
The numbers where all wrong !!! 😡 it's not 30 mins for duo it's 45 and 60 for a solo. And it's not 4 parties of two it's 3 that have completed it.🤬     For the simpletons it's a joke
Should take your own filet or boning knife. Help with the hand fatigue
God bless you all and repent and give y’all life to Christ he is the only way, truth, and the life
Where's the beef??? In beards stomach lol
That looks SOOO GOOOD
They could’ve given you a decent steak knife mate!!!
"I draw the line at babies" 😂
Stop gripping your implements too tightly!  That’s why you have Mrs. Beard for 😂🤣
I thought they said 45 minutes for two people, and an hour for one.
Norfolkn way
That is amazing. You must exercise like crazy. I gained 5 pounds watching this.
I got full eating 3 chicken wings the other night
You needed a sharper knife to begin with!
i hope you do colon cleanses
Holy S**T ! That was a big chunk of cow. That looked like a Sunday roast for a family of four. Once again great job. Keep up the great videos.
At 5:56 reminds me of Mr Bean for some reason lol !!!
I always look forward to your video, its the only reason I come on YouTube these days 🙏😀
Your commentary is the best commentary I I've heard on any YouTube channel.
Do you edit your videos to match your voiceovers or edit your voiceovers to match your videos?
If they gave you a proper sharp steak knife you're fingers wouldn't hurt. But then again it must be pretty tender if you can cut it with a butter knife.
100% a record on the longest no beard napkin use. probably a guiness world record mate. well done adam
Don’t you mean 45 and 60 minutes.
Lmao collab with the knitting club
you need a better knife.
dear god how did they over cook a large chunk of steak like that, or did you order medium well Mr beard.
Can’t believe you left the fat!!!?!!!?!? It’s the best bit! 😡😂
Oye3ee you bearded beast🤙💪☝️
you need a better knife.
He's not human he's a caveman
Next time maybe a shaper knife. Looks like you are using a butter knife, lol.
Jesus loves u
i would 100% buy my dog a mixed grill christ that is an absolute monster steak
think this fella is gonna be doin some chewin
That was amazing. I thought you weren’t going to make it halfway in but you pulled through strong!!!! 💪💪💪💪
That meal would have fed a family of 6,but 1 legend of a man ate it all by himself. We'll done and go and have a nice lie down.❤🇦🇺👏👏
You know Adam feels confident when he gives a go at the shorter team time during a solo attempt.  Did you take the assn up on knitting lessons? ;)
I love the rind. My fav part 😂
Great great channel. Thank you Adam. I always laugh.
You did a awesome job
You should have a second channel where you discuss having the worlds longest turds in history. And maybe an OF for the weirdos.
Why did they give you what looks like a butter knife to cut that steak?
Nice job Beard !
Just epic...u got talent 🍴
Awesome challenge!
Dude you're amazing
I really liked your random enthusiastic energy when asked to take a photo. That steak looked bomb dude!
Just found the channel and love the videos.  I do hope you are regularly checking up with a doctor which I imagine you are.  Keep up the great content!!
eating a 100oz steak with a butter knife is half of the challenge.
As a Texan, I graciously concede that steak was much more work than anything this state can throw at you.  Well done sir, I tip my hat and nod my chin to you.
Great job, Adam!!!
I see why you have dessert the sweet helps cut the fat and richness. It would take me days to eat all that beef. Nice sides looks like a great meal.
Do yall not have steak knives wtf?
You should do a video with Katrina and randy
Love your videos...eat it
The best part
That one was Herculean 🤯
Why are you cutting a steak with a butter knife?
When you say the dessert is nice. Is it actually nice? Does food even taste good after you've had that much?
Am I wrong or did Adam not say, "delicious" even once???
Can you please say the price that the meal  would cost if you were to fail the challenge?
“Time starts when you cut into your steak.”  ADAM! You eat the sides first then stab the steak to start your time! 😊😂  No steak was harmed during starters getting consumed.
Big W on this one! Nice work!
Brother Beard, you are a machine... yep that would be the weight of a small baby, I bet it will feel like giving birth to one when that meal exits your butt hole, ouch.... blooody hell man you're gonna tear ya self a new one...
Tough one! Well done! Have you ever had a spew after a challenge?
Man I'd love to see the beard take on 200oz steak or burger or something
That fudge cake looked amazing!
I tried this at home Needless to say I threw up very early on and now I can’t stand eating meat  I don’t think I’ll have meat for the next year or so  Meat disgusts me now lol
In Canada that is not a steak. It is a blade roast.
He's eating more than the animals on Noah's ark.
I didn't start today thinking I would be called a 'Beardling'. I like it.🙂 Then you call us all 'Beef army'. These Nicknames are nice. I really like the folks in the restaurant. The proprietor and the team were lovely. The knitting ladies were sweet and respectful. Real gems. That was a monstrous meal so well done. And at the end, they were waiting for you to ask for dessert. Your notoriety or celebrity is growing. BTW I don't think I've eaten that much beef over the last 10 years. Brilliant!
That thumbnail, Holy Sh*t!
I live in the United States  the state is Wisconsin there’s a place here in Milwaukee that’s called the Wand prime rib they have a challenge that you can get much prime rib as you want right now the record stands at 22 pounds and 6 ounces of prime rib one person completed in one sitting here’s the thing if you beat it by ordering more you become the new title holder and the person that was in the first place gets dropped on the second I would really love to see you come here and attempt that challenge
No steak knife
That was epic mate, well bloody done ! It was good looking tucker.   I would of asked the knitting club ladies to knit you a new colon .
am i wrong for watching these while doing extended fasting?
What kind of dump does one have after this?
slayed the cow
This place and the employee was one of the best !! I'm sure everyone agrees with that =)
Ok Adam you have out done yourself this time . You are the man..
A better knife would have helped ❤
Randy was the man not anymore.
What!  Not into sharing...   Missus Beard is sad..
Whose posh enough to cut there steak with a butter knife.....
I am a bigger pig than beard because I would have eaten that fat... 😔
When do you plan to retire?
Anyone else feel it in the guts when he sighs after eating half this monster?
Everytime I watch his videos my toxic trait comes out and be like I can do this
Seafood boil challenge next?👀👀
Hello from Georgia, I love your videos, your accent and your laugh.
Knitting people are some of the nicest people I've ever come across in a restaurant.
He must take massive dumps
I love your videos, the best part is always the question about a dessert menu and people's looks 😂👍 Greetings from Germany 👋
Fat is the best bit on any steak!!
You are a bad dude!!!
You maintain the title Bearded Beast.
Michigan USA  Says Beyond Excellent!
Dude you are a BEAST! ✌
Love your videos.  I'm thinking chef's in the UK don't know how to prepare mushrooms well. Dip them in the BBQ sauce to see if that helps. If you ever come to Los Angeles, California, USA, I would like to know so I can see you do what you do. Stay healthy, please.
Big Win👍🏻
the fat is the best part
now that was impressive
that chocolate cake at the end looked incredible
I'm convinced Beard is actually hollow
I've NEVER seen you use a fork and a knife for 20minutes! That's a new record adam!!
Beard! Thanks for the upload mate! Way to crush it as always 😎 cheers mate
0:53 I ain't even white but don't u ever disrespect me like that being late. I mean u got a free meal, son. And if u ever wanna come check me irl, I think I can take u bro
Next time ask for a sharper knife!!!!!!!!!!!
Sir Beard.
Bro you should do the Jack Sparrow beard. I think it would be easier for you to eat without the hair getting in the way. Trim the stache a bit.
I’m a meat lover too , sorry for the French language i’m French speaking from Quebec, but I can eat a 2 1/2 lbs piece of porc called « ÉCHINE DE PORC «  that is the most tender part of the shoulder part of the porc , I can eat it in 40 minutes.
Why do you English include mushrooms in everything? yuck!!
Gluttony is a sin man. It is also gross.
The craziest thing is I was driving back from great Yarmouth in Norfolk to London tonight and I see up on the sign Swaffham and I was taking the P*** out of the name to my missus, never heard of the place before in my life before this, anyway I get home about 1 this morning, decide to put on a bit of Youtube and see beard's got a new video, put it on and you're in f***ing Swaffham lol.
I am not a "beardling". I prefer the term "BEARDO". YES I am a wierdo with a beardo and proud of it. 🧔‍♂️
My guy where does the food go? You so blessed that your body can breakdown all that food in no time. If I try that I will be rolling in a ball after two weeks!
I wanna do a eating Channel but I’m nervous I won’t make it but I’m really glad youtube put you into my recommendations been watching videos back to back‼️‼️‼️🤧
A true ManMeatsFood challenge
I always wonder why you wouldn’t eat a handful of mushrooms every now and then, rather than torturing yourself with a whole bunch at once.
You need a '100 oz of Mushrooms' Challenge .....
You and Joel Hanson have to be the 2 best competitive food eaters on the planet you both do the undoable
what's that in metric?
Next time you do a challenge like this take an electric turkey carver.
This one had me unsure at first!!
Waiting for a beards meats food towel merch. Will be the first to order.
Super human effort
I new it your starting to like the shrooms
Your face at them end 🤣 🤭 Well done, sir
My guess it's more of a chewing challenge than a eating challenge.
You deserve a massive sundae challenge after this heat wave
Great challenge Beard, I knew that you would beat it with lots of time left. Another one completed buddy! And  the first time this was done solo, nice😎👍
This guy is an absolute savage! 💪👍
100 Oz er, we in Texas are humbled!!  No this cannot be true ! Must be some Hollywood CGI eat fantasy film?  "Beardman" has to be the new Marvel Super eater hero ? Huge Fan from Houston Texas !
Surprised this wasn’t done in under 30 minutes. Joel Hanson would have done it in under 30 minutes
Isn’t it 45 a pair 60 solo
I think my cholesterol level went up just by watching that! This guy is killing it!
The cake was the best part!
I think out of all your videos this one hurt my sphincter the most
for once can you not attack America and Americans? your so sweet when your in England and the uk but when you come to the u.s you bash everything. i'd like to see how many American subscribers you have because you sure do hate us
You are a machine
His turd must have broke the toilet
'I love meat as much as the next dude' - Mr. Beard
About 5minutes in, you conclude the meal challenge and those attempted it. Completely different to what he said. Even the time you have to do it in as a solo and duo. And you literally edited it just before what he said. 🤭🤦‍♂️😚
That steak was really overcooked.
That chocolate cake came clutch lol
👍
What is it that you say when you start eating? It sounds like, "ISHTOLLA!"
I love how you forced that bite of cake down just for us! Love watching you eat bro!
They told you 2 people have 35 minutes and 1 person has 60.. but in the voiceover you said 30 and 45.  Update: and now that I've actually finished the video, that looked like the struggle was real!!
Who wouldn’t love to see a collab with the ladies knitting crew? 😎🤣
They should call it the Norfolk N Weigh Steak Challenge.
Love watching the videos and just grab a plate and chow down
nice
Crushed an unbeaten massive challenge in no time flat and still hit em with the dessert request.  Absolute legend.
Sooo.... BeardMeatsKnitting Merch? Hand-knit by the Beard himself?
When I saw that big chunk of fat, it reminded me of the movie "The Great Outdoors", where John Candy ate the "Old 96er". If you have never seen that movie, you'll die laughing!
Great work mate 👍💪🔥
You’re my hero.
Geez man you are an icon. This video reminds me of The Great Outdoors with John Candy
How the hell do you stay slim? Genuine question!
WOW
This guy could teach and help world hunger!
You're an absolute beast and I want your shoes!!!!!
I wonder if it tastes more like roast or like a steak.
So....he said "Start the timer when you cut into the steak"...could you eat the sides without the timer being started since you didnt cut the steak XD lol doesnt help they gave you a butter knife to cut it with either.
Ordering a desert at the end is always funny. But I laugh harder at him drinking Diet Coke while eating a 100 oz steak..
Awesome video! Missing Mrs Beard!
Hello Sunshine from Alabama USA.  I’m always impressed with your food devouring ability, but mostly with your manners and concern for others.  My grandson and I thoroughly enjoy your videos and commentaries on the food, environment, and the ‘meat gazers’.  Keep it up Sunshine!
Cake with cream? Hmmm interesting
What? No steak knife??? That thing looks like a dull butter knife!
Beardlings? is there such a word? That bed warmer goes into the bed before you get in, you take it out when you get in.
Remember to drink hibiscus tea, beat juice and/or prunes to help your bowls move easier 👌🏻
I always watch your vids, just to watch you eat dessert for 10 secs.
Got the meat sweats, eh? The Beef Army enjoyed this one!
“Do you have a dessert menu?”  “Yes, it has a 3 lb. Steak a la mode 🥩!”
LEGEND
thumbnail; my brain; that looks effing delicious!!! cue drooling
The fat is the best part!
Ill be your wingman anytime. Thanks for vids. Good distraction. Why do always have to ask for napkins?
Brd mts fd what about all u can eat sushi bar? I'll be watching 4 ur reply
Lol you think you're healthy? Talk to your doctor.
Final onion ring boof
That steak looked kinda tough ngl
Bro the fat is the best part.
are imperial ounces smaller than american ounces? also can't believe you left that beautiful rendered fat cap
WOW...🤯🤯🤯🤯
The desert i just cause the next days are gonna be brutal i might as well enjoy myself....."what  beard would say"
Landlord's in flip-flops ? That's a new one.
My mouth waters on every video!
That was crazy 😳
It looks to me like you're cutting that steak with a butter knife no wonder your arms were struggling a bit. Fantastic work mate!
I love that the kitchen staff came out to witness the completion and applaud.. Top marks to the White Hart.
😆 that dessert menu question always gets um 😄
Need a steak knife bro. Good job
Adam, I don't envy that challenge at all. The last challenge I did was the Kodiak Arrest Challenge at Humpy's in Anchorage AK. Back then you had 90 minutes to eat half the menu it seemed and I failed with 1 bite of crisp left. Never felt more gutted in my life. I still had room to finish it easily if I had the pace a wee bit quicker. However, that food challenge retired me from the challenge scene.
They were trying to sabotage your time with butter knife.
They made their challenge very fair. No stacking on a kilo of rubbish oven chips and a large tin of baked beans to stump you here.
Do you *ever* fail a challenge?? Highly impressive dedication to your art. A masterclass this one. Thankyou 🙏
A beard bib isn't a bad idea. You'd get some looks but probably no more than you do without it.
A couple questions, does a restaurant flavor the meat when it’s that much? And does seasoning make any sort of difference to the challenge?
Where's Mrs Beard these days?
Yeah, it says something that your hands give out before your jaw does. It's still hard to wrap my head around all that fitting inside a single stomach. Bonkers.
Ok so i need to know what kind of shoes those are? I am digging them
Never thought I'd actually see a real-life "Old 96'er" challenge conquered. John Candy would be proud of you!
Stop chatting up women beard mrs beard may watch this
Adam is actually the goat
Plenty of lubricant to get it down 🤔
Don’t call me a “beardling”…
Your A Machine
Adam, you are the gentleman pig.
Loved this one! Such great staff and nice ladies in the background 😊
Should have gave you sharp knife at least
If you are still in norfolk try the smokehouse in ormesby mate next to hemsby, right up your street that is
You constantly cease to amaze me.    Fkin   SIX POUNDS (and four ounces to be pedantic) of fkin meat, crikey, dont you ever think about possible complications?  I mean, you could get seriously bunged up or summat. Anyway, all the best.  (I am just astounded about how you can deal with consuming so much stuff).
Realising Mr Beard was just down the road from me 😢
Love when the staff is supportive
Wish he didn't  just order dessert and actually ate the fat to assert dominance.
This man just devoured 7000 calories and still had the appetite to go for dessert.
Bro you are literally my favorite YouTuber EVER !! your videos make me so happy
Nicely done kiddo. I honestly thought this was going to be a fail as that thing was humungus but you knocked it out the park. And off topic, sort off, my mum learnt me how to knit when I was a kid. First "real" thing I knitted was a scarf for when I was out on my motorbike, yeah, I was a biker who knitted his own riding gear hahaha. The lads ribbed me about it until I knitted in the motorbike name/type into the scarf at which point they all wanted one lol, no, I told them they had Norfolk 'n' chance ;p
The final onion ring also known as the 'funion ring' 😁😁
Holy crap my friend! Well done!!
I wonder the feeling of knowing you could eat a whole ass baby
Thought he said 45 mins for a pair or 60 mins for solo, but in the commentary you said 30 duo or 45 solo?
Beardlings? Lol too funny! And sharing is caring.
Great! The „knitting Ladies“ - excellent. My mom did it a lot but had to quit due to arthrosis in her hands…
You are probably one of my Newest favorite Food Challenge Youtubers. Your videos are extremely entertaining to watch and addictive as heck. Great work and always look forward to new content from you. 👍🏼👍🏼😃😃
Also, top tip. Should have taken an electric carving knife for the steak.
The courtesy of this fine gentleman.
Well at least he will have enough protein to recover the muscles from the fatigue haha.
Mmm... fat's where the flavour is, Beard.
Pro tip: cut the fat off first homie
I'm big fan well done mate
I draw the line at babys ….. unless theres a tshirt
4:04 I think you got the time wrong.  A pair gets 45 and solo you get 60 they say as much at 2:45.  Makes your time much more impressive
Great job !!!  That was an enormous steak! Plus you did it so quickly 👍.
You better a few laxatives! Yikes!
I weep for your toilet.
i honestly wouldn't blame you for avoiding steak for the foreseeable future after eating that much in one sitting.
Are you cutting it with a butter knife?
I hope you took up the ladies offer to teach you a few knitting tips haha!
Who come here just for desserts
Sadly you missed a challenge here in Houston Texas 🤠🤘at a restaurant called Deeez pit stop! I know it sounds a bit “ nutty”  I tried it dandy only finished half.. any ways! I’ll catch you on the next one!!😂😂🤣
They gave you a damn butter knife to cut with..
What? No garlic bread? Nooooooooo How long does your jaw hurt for afterwards?
No fat it don’t count
So nice to see that their side dishes were normal portion size!😁
You needed a steak knife
Another wonderful performance.  You are a Competitive Eating Genius!
Well done Adam!!!  Knit 1 Purl 2. Lol.
Wouldn't be a BeardMeatsFood video without getting the numbers correct. Also, congrats on the soon to be 2 million subscribers!
I just got some awful news in life😔. Appreciate all you do!
So this is over 6lbs of animal flesh, followed by a concoction of fried no value foods, and a couple slices of tomato. Do I salute this or say Wow! What some will do for a shilling?
Beard…fantastic stuff.
How does the diet coke help?
Awesome.
What. An. Absolute. UNIT.
Incredible
Mate, you're an absolute beast. I'm always in awe of your ability to put these challenges away. I can't even remember the last one that beat you. Perhaps that burrito?
What is it that you say before starting a challenge?? "Ishhhhh Tullaaaaaa" I can't figure it out.
“Baby, it’s the other other white meat.”—Fat Bastard 1999
"I draw the line at babies." That kid looked absolutely terrified.
The people in these places outside of USA have GREAT bandtor. 💙💚💛💜
They should have provided you with a proper steak knife...
That sly look and eyebrow raise at the camera near the end when he said they're not anal about the steak gristle, had me in stitches 😂
Why werent you given a real steak knife? Thats why your arms were tired bud!
That is incredible but your poor stomach and intestines the work you make those organs go through is inhumane
All you need is A1 sauce and why the hell did you get a butter knife!
Outstanding Mr. Beard, Outstanding Sir!
Bruh A1 sauce! That’s all you need!
You're so polite
I thought this one was going to get you ..allways enjoy your videos 💪🏼
😋 yummy
Looked like beard was on another planet neigh another dimension when that chocolate cake hit.
Who calls a rump roast a steak?
Beardlings is great
im a fairly new subscriber but man i just cant stop watching you eat . your a mad man . lol . good job buddy
This was seriously impressive
LOL... BEARDLINGS...too funny. You are grrrreat!
You really never cease to amaze us all!!! WELL DONE!!🥰🥰 Hello Mrs. Beard!!👋
Camera jumping around so much I got motion sickness
I now expect a Beard knitting video.
Your the King in my book fella
fat is the best part :/
May have even beat the times of the couples, less than 45 mins.
Patented pinch of the onion ring stack to place them in a pile in front of him like it is the last of his stash
So what is it about mushrooms you don’t like Sir Beard?
love the fat its the best bit. Great content mate
Rump steak, love that.  Seriously, the rump has nice flavour
Yeah like you would ever post content of your failure to complete a challenge 🙄 But I do love your channel!👍
I get not having to eat the fat but that seemed like a good amount. I wonder how much weight that took off the steak.  I would've tried taking bits of it with the steak as there is a lot of flavor.
My colon would hurt after just half of it
I love the “uggghh, that’s nice” at the end 😂
That looks like about seven chips. Finally, somewhere under chipped you 🙌
I recently came across your channel and I've been binge watching your videos ever since I'm also a fellow brit 🇬🇧
Он потом очень много пердит, наверное 🚶‍♂️ 💨
Good timing solo.
First 10 secs n u already got me laughing "not into sharing" crickey mate you eat for 10 sometimes 🤣 no sh*t legend! ( 10 mins in still laughing I've heard ladies discuss knitting with passion I could only describe as when someone is reading war poetry in a way, I get ya lol 😆)
When this guy goes to the toilet, he could cause the next tsunami.
couldnt even give u a proper steak knife mate
This will definitely kill you kid young no matter what they say ! Achtung baby. Your stomach can take it but your heart ❤️ definitely cannot. Eventually your heart will just cave in and you will just drop …..
I would never skip out on the fat cap, its the best part of the steak.
Why on earth did they not give you a steak knife?
I've never thought about this but my dad is 70, doesn't get on the internet, but he would just respect the heck out of your abilities. He looked a lot like you do at your age and was about 155lbs, he could always pound food but he would probably have his hand on his heart watching you eat, maybe even a tear in the eye..lol
Another job well done sir!!
I know this is odd, but, can iu show your abs before and after. Super curious about the difference
This mf dont miss
Adam, how the hell much do you spend on t- paper, every year?...
GOAT
I wonder why you don't already have the ultimate Japanese steel steak knife ready for these challenges, you know .. really sharp knive with a comfortable handle, maybe even in a lacquered wooden box with sliding lid ...  or would that be against the rules ?
This was a Awesome video.. look at this huge amount of steak and sides folks… just wow💁🏻‍♀️
Was this place in Forza 4? Looks really like it
When are You & Mrs Beard coming down under 🐨🦘🐊🐍
I see a gout attack in Beard's near future.
And this is why the world still looks to the U.K. for it's stability.... "The Swaffham Knitting Association".
You'll need a bigger boat 🤣🤣
"The Swaffham Knitting Association" was the name of my T-Rex cover band!
The Beard is one of the nicest people on Earth.
That fat would lubricate those bowels and make ya smooth as 🧈 😆
Omg when he was talking to the baby all I could think of was Austin powers "I wanna eat yurrrr babyyy" 😂
What's is up with everyone with mushrooms with these challenges lately? That's rough lol
O_O
My gums hurt looking through this challenge.
Dude, bring your own knife. Serated edges suck. Bring an excellent very sharp blade.
This guy is making a living off eating free food he’s a walking W😂😂
Somebody told me that they don't serve drinks with ice in England and Europe in general. Yet they served you coke with ice. What's the truth?
although I actively dislike steak, your videos are always a pleasure. have a great day!
Good on ya mate
I love that they know the dessert menu is your signature 🤣
Another steak challenge Bites the Dust! Beard does the job of two LOL! You haven't been saying "Let's get it" lately. I have watched tons of your  videos..... but I still don't know what the other phrase is you say at the beginning. Kind of sounds like H2O, but I'm sure that's not it. Somebody clue me in if you know
When can we subscribe to the BeardKnitsFood channel?
I have spent many an hour in Swaffham, attending Tyrone's market auction most Saturday's. Halcyon days. I love Norfolk! Well done Beard, another great achievement!
I love the commentary over your videos. You should do a behind the scenes of you recording your voice over or how you go about it cause it’s always awesome and funny. Just a thought lol.
I've never seen anyone offer fudge cake and cream. I would try it for sure. Seems like a perfect match.
Curious: Does the Beard have TMJ from all this chewing?
You should bring your own A1, Heinz 57 and BBQ sauce.  No one will sponsor you for all these views?
I bet you can eat 150 pierogis !!!! You choose your toppings … I’m eating homemade  blueberry pierogi right now n just housed like 23 so u can destroy
What a crappy knife.
You may have answered this before but have you ever ended up eating any of your beard/stache in any challenges?
Congrats on the solo my lad. Any idea why a duo can't finish this?
What a wonderful group of people and a lovely place to boot. That looked a superb piece of steak. Very nice challenge.
“We’re not Anal … 🤨”
BBQ sauce with steak yuck
👍👍👏👏 BRAVO!!! Well done He Man!! Huge challenge
I would love to see you eat your way through one of the big metal festivals, like Download, Hellfest or Wacken
Been watching for a year. I actually felt bad for you on this one. Have a like and subscribe. I can't freeload watch off you in good conscience on this one.
Well done son, sterling performance...
You sir are a savage
thats death sin what you are doing so dont say i didnt know
Yeah I'd pay good money to watch you learn how to knit lol good video!
100oz for a day, that's enough for me  45 minutes tho *I'mma have the Ambulance on Quick Dial xD*
probably cutting the meat gets harder to eat
When they used those old fashioned bed-warmers, they wouldn't leave it in the bed! You couldn't even leave it in one spot for too long without burning the sheets. You (or a servant) would wave it around before you got into the bed.
Brilliant job!
I was a huge fan of this channel watching for a long time and always check out the videos after work, but I am very disappointed with this one! Who has cream with fudge cake and not ice-cream disgusting! 🤣😂👍 😭
Chestnut would’ve done it in 25 minutes
Solo 60min not 45min he said 22min left and u finished in 38min.
Awesome been following since you did the w Wimpy challenge in my hometown Stafford! Absolute legend Adam!
I do this sort of thing locally, but I always tip the value of the meal, because a business is a business, and nothing is free, really.
You want the fat left on. That was overcooked, but it was a quality steak.  What temp did you ask for?
Your an animal mate.  I love it!!
Why are there no steak knives in the UK? Madness!
45 min for teams 1hour for solo.he said..then said 30 for team and 45 for solo ..lol
It's not a bed pan, it's a stringless banjo...
i am suprised he didn't ask for a sharp knife from the kitchen staff or the meat to be cooked rare or medium rare
Another great video
lol i swear that knife looks like a butter knife
Hey Adam great video man I live in Kings Lynn 20 mile down the road. Was it good steak? Coz if it was ill grab a buddy of mine and have a crack at that. How much is it if you fail?
Legend!
Is that a butler knife?
Beard as much as I love you videos, the constant camera shaking is really starting to strain my eyes :(
Warming pan gets moved around in your bed by a servant wench or whatever you call them/they/zee nowadays…….. then removed before you climb in…… as, combustion doesn’t enhance a good nights sleep……. 🙂
Wow beard you the man  I so would not like to see the state of that bog the next morning 🤣🤣 Bloody well done  I was getting meat sweats just watching 😂😂😂😂
🙃BEARD ARMY.....
Beard is on a roll…not errored in quite a while 👍🏼
Maybe use a sharp knife instead of a butter knife? They wanted you to feel the meal.
The fat is the best part! Great video though.
Looks like a Fred Flintstone steak
You make the picture to your video actually bigger than what you are going to eat, it's just a click bait and you know what you are doing 🙄
😆😆😆
So why not eat the mushrooms first and get them out the way being that they're the worst or mix em with the tomato sauce or bakd beans.
Ledge!
Mr Beard: You teach me how to knit, I'll teach you how to eat 100oz steaks 😄
How about a real steak knife!, FFS that’s a butter knife
Maybe you can knit some chips ,this way you don't have to eat them...lol
I have no intrest in eating competitions, i'm a vegetarian, but still I never miss an episode from you even when the whole meal is just a big chunk of meat.  One of my favorite channels on youtube!
They could of gave you a better knife.
This one was particularly impressive
What an absolute machine! Well done buddy! I knew you would smash it!
Girls portion of cake at the end 🤣🤣
F'in epic!
Best collaboration ever! Now you need to get them to knit a beard for the missus!
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Amazing work beard the machine I wonder if he gets now his bear warmer from this adorable old lady made xD
Hahahaha
I’m Canadian and you are amazing. Like I love steak but the baby references were way off. My son was 10 pounds something. 3.57 oz’s is not viable. Lol Legend at eating and the time was so awesome. Really enjoyed your editing, the knitters and the staff. Subscribed. Xxoo. Looked like a great place with nice people….. that helps. Thank you I remembered to share now.
Theory:  beard is actually just a highly skilled slight of hand magician... the food LOOKS like it goes in the mouth but truly escapes through a hatch located one inch deep inside the beard, below the mouth.  Only plausible explanation for what I've witnessed on this channel.
He must've been constipated for a week!
Didnt he say it was 45 min for 2 and 60 min solo?
Looks a bit dry that one
Norfolk, UK  Norfolk ,VA let’s gooooooo!!!!!
Next time bring a saws all
Once again Great Job!!
That dessert menu always takes people off guard! good job Mr. Beard
100oz is nearly 3 kg of meat. That could feed me for more than one week.
Very enjoyable Adam thanks for an entertaining episode
That eyebrow raise bawahhaha
I think you might be doing yourself a disservice there mate. I'm pretty sure the bloke said an hour for a solo attempt and 45 minutes for two people.
Your so entertaining to watch and I love hearing you conversate with people ❤  Your always so kind to everybody and deserve all the success in the world. We hope lady beard is also doing well!
You are now my official hero.
Someone else may have corrected you already,  but 60 minutes solo, 45 minutes duo per dude at establishment.
Dude don't do it that's huge 😳  OMG.
I'd say the toilet hated you after that
I didnt think you would be able to do this one....That was amazing to watch..
Love the term foliage for the green stuff 😋
No steak knife?!
What massive steakhouse uses IKEA CUTTLERY?! Bruh, that knife ain't the thing you need. This is a strength challenge.
Very impressive Beard!!
Love this man you’re such a beast. Love every video.
At the end of every single video I can't help clap for a minute! You are a beast Mr.Beard!
Sheesh 100 oz of meat, thats just ridiculous lol.
Your plumber must own a yacht...
You need to collab with the SIDEMEN!!!
38 minutes!! Outstanding indeed. You're unreal beard.
“Don’t worry I draw the line at babies”
Just noticed your closing in on 2 million Adam!
I never thought of it before but on the steak challenges they need to have extremely sharp knives ready.
Ay Beard! What a challenge to score out of the card! Common man, tell us how the rest of the afternoon was trying to knit yourself a beard net ?🤣🤣
Smashed it!! Well done yet again! 💯💯
it looks well done some medium well and a plastic fork? that's just mean
Bed warmers are run over the sheets before you get into the bed, they don't stay in the bed with you
BEEEAAAAAAASSSSSTTT
I is hungry now
1st don't try yiddish words if you can't speak Yiddish  2nd the fat is the best part especially if it's crispy
7:25 It's funny how he realised while eating that he was probably gonna ask himself the question at home about how much meat was left on the platter, so he lifted it up. Love your videos!
They should have given you a sharp knife at least!
shouts to you for saying chutzpah
A friend of mine used to call it foliage around 20 years ago, reminded me of him😂
Welcome to Norfolk Beardy.
That bog is gonna suffer in the morning
that steak looked dry af
The man at the bar said a pair gets 45 minutes and solo you get an hour.
That’s 6 1/4 pounds of cow 🐮
My teeth and jaw started hurting from sympathy just watching this.
Iv'e a feeling that a farmer would keep you for your ''fertilizer'' !
I just ate 600 grams spareribs and french fries today. Hurts me seeing you eat that large meat. Well done as always BeardMeatsFood
Cleanest glass that I've seen aye hahahaha
Wow that is a mountain of meat keep up the video
You'd think he'd carry his own utensils to have a sharp knife and fork.
Another great video my friend!!!!! Keep them coming and keep up the great work!!!!!!!!
Now they will have to add the cake to the challenge. Next time you should bring your own knife. A properly sharp knife would reduce the work of that challenge by at least 30%.
You should bring a electric knife when you're doing a steak challenge... it would save you a lot of time.
your in my home town so gutted I missed you
Smashed it.  Great effort
Hey just saying its not 30 mins for two and 45 solo its 45mins if you have two people and 1hr if you have one I sure it was to easy for ya so you got mixed up in your editing
Beard. If you support Leeds R.L.F.C I think that’s make you my man crush 😻
Bears knits food.....  I’ll get my coat 😂😂
The fact that he really doesn't try to speed eat these challenges, he just enjoys the food and eats it relatively quick. Love this guy man lmfao
What a legend
Wonder if he leaves a tip
Your an absolute beast. No beard. No beastie beard. No bearded beast. Great job Adam.
How many grams of protein was in that? Gotta be 200 250 grams of protein.  Much anabolic
They should have gave you a better steak knife! That does not look sharp at all by the way you're hacking away at the steak haha
Well done man... 👏 ✔ I did get worried near the end .... me is thinking you have hit your limit on the size off any meals you do next
I nearly fell off my seat when The Beard dipped his salad into the BBQ sauce! 🤣 Another great video!
You need to make shirts saying "Do you have a dessert menu?!" 😂🤣
Hey man, love your videos. You should do a challenge with Guga foods. This would very interesting 🤔
You should look at wards house of prime in Milwaukee WI USA
Wow!!!  Incredible!!!
I never thought I would enjoy so much to watch another person eat so much food in one sit. Thursdays and Sundays are awesome now. hahaha
Beast mode
Curious to know if you beat the time it took two people to finish it?
Beard doesn't need lessons in becoming a nit lol.
Dude, that was amazing. Straight up unreal that you housed a 6 + lb steak and sides!!
U need to make a video on all the t-shirts u have won now that would be cool to see. 👍 so he can see this
The bed warmer was removed before you got into bed, the early pottery hot water bottles were wrapped in a blanket or something and that was left in the bed.
More Swastham knitting association colabs please?
Wow!
about 1/4 of that steak was fat so its not really 100oz is it
Would be interesting to see some fail videos….  Curious what that is like.  Otherwise super awesome.
Congratulations.  What you do is amazing !  Please . . . I hope you go get your cholesterol and your coronary arteries checked !!  Seriously !  i want to watch you for years.  Stay healthy
“Do you have a desert menu” love that line 😂😂😂
At the end I was half expecting you to say “I Might need a midwife in the morning to deliver this lot…”
As they said, "Outstanding" Adam! You smashed it.
Surely it's an unwritten rule that you have to leave at least 1 onion ring to the end
Oh dear 😳  I am usually like, oh ok....but bloody hell!!😂😋
Aye let me get that Steak Fat Bro?!?!
Rather disgusting given the world's food condition.  Only entertainment matter, no thinking, if it feels good do it. Very depressing that this is a thing.... C-ya
Bigger knife would have helped
That was impressive.
i've watched every video and i still don't know what he says and i love it
That steak looked way over cooked
Give the poor Beard a better knife! Great video!
60 minutes solo and 45 as a duo . 4m 8s you ballsed that up . sorry fella.
Insane. Great customer service
yo  beard, this might  be the  greatest episode  of past year, people were great, food was great and you were great too!
Huge respect for you! Real man, such an inspiration!
👍👍💪💪
Nice one beef killer
Damn.  This man can eat.  He is off on the times.  If he does it in his times he'll kill any records.  I love it
This reminds me of that old movie “The Great Outdoors” with John Candy trying that steak challenge.
Can't you get bigger knife for these?!  Norfolk suggestion is spot on. Will have to keep watching to see if you get a bib. That was an excellent commercial for the restaurant.  I'd go there if I was ever in the area. Tough commute from Boston, MA, USA
🐽🧔‍♀️
Killin' his arms cutting a Big-Ass steak with a butter knife! 🤣
You are the hero that the world never knew it needed
Hey no Texas jokes lol, enjoyed as always.
Absolutely smashed it !!!! But could they not have provided a decent Steak knife 😂 well done Beardie 👏🏻👏🏻
Where TF does he put it all 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Your such a pig Beard lol. Love it 😊
Love watching your channel but it always makes me hungry 🤣keep eating Mr Beard 💪💯
Adam, you rock. Not only a professional, but warm and f**ing funny. Never stop, bro. You make loads of people's YouTube time enjoyable. X  Side note: What is it about mushrooms you're not a fan of, pal? Both competitively, and in general?  Side-side note: You bossing a dessert afterwards, NEVER gets old. ^_^
Don't know how I feel about the flip flops in a restaurant but the vibes were definitely awesome by the staff and co.
They didn't even give a proper knife!
You should totally do a colab with one of those blacksmith channels to get your own custom set of cutlery. Should help with hand stress and you'll never have to worry about dull knifes.
Beard's rusty sheriff's badge the day after will be a fucking bombsite.
Mate next video call it beard meats knitting lol
Can't believe I missed this video.... Oh well, I can sleep at the weekend
How much does it cost?
enough to feed 20 of me
Sweet baby Jesus that was one big ass hunk of meat 😂 you sir beard are a brilliant animal
"Greetings Beardlings". 🤣🤣   Your humors remarkable😂. Still enjoying the content brother. Blessings!!!  Side note, didn't they have a steak knife? Looked more like a butter knife ey
The old 96’er !!
Das a lot of meat. It always impresses me how you can eat so much and not gain a ton of weight.
This guy's a freak of nature
I thought that the landlord said that you got 60 minutes to eat it yourself? As you said around the 4 minutes make you said 45 minutes
In honour of Alan Partridge's own trip to Swaffham, I'm just going to put, "Nice beard"
You are a machine!!!!!!
The man's a savage.
Well done man
What do you say on 3.15 ...I can't work it out !
Beard beats food vs Joel Hansen I’d love to see it!
BTW: "meat sweats" arent really a thing.
Woah! Congrats on that one! That was a huge steak lol
Am I the only who watches him while eating
My idel bro i love food challenges. But this steak look awesome. My favorite meat besides fish.
Why one earth did you wear a jumper? 🙈🙈🙈🙈. Well done mate, have to be honest and say I was worried at one point but you smashed it in the end. 🥩💥🤛🏻
That was not a steak. Just an over cooked grandma roast. Can't believe they served that.
Was that a proper steak knife????
this is a great video
Hey Beard, I eat a lot of Steak and I ditched the cheap knife from the Pub. Started bringing my own Knife and this (Cut) the fatigue. Hope it helps, Enjoy.
What did they give you a butter knife to cut that steak lol. Another great video.
Just grab it like a cave man and eat
You beat the time limit for two people, crazy!
Legendary performance. That much Meat/Beef has got to be very hard to eat. This is the Only video I have seen Adam struggle in.
Outstanding brother ✊🏻
You look like you are in lots of pain. Lol nice job
Your team of 2 is you, and that epic beard yo!
it was called a bed pan and was moved around in the bed, so as not to burn the linen and removed before you got in
Is it just me or did you get the instructions wrong? You had 60 minutes for solo and 45 for a team of two ..and you gave yourself 45 and have mentioned that in the description too
The 👶
Superbo. Beard!
Wow incredible another win
So please that you've started to visit my neck of the woods. The only thing is that you say Swaffham wrong, anyone that's from there knows what I mean!
I clicked expecting him to eat the fat. Disappointed. That amount of fat would destroy your gall bladder
Who the fuck is wearing a jumper in the middle of summer?
Ah gutted, if I knew you were coming to Norfolk, I would of 100% come and said hello
Looks like they gave you a butter knife!
Fantastic that challenge. Let’s get ready for the 2 m special challenge
The dessert bite at the end is the perfect chef's kiss. 🤌
Love the Carry On background music 😂
Get knitting beard! Top skill that is!
You're a straight up beast 🤣 keep on doing what you do best
As impressive as it is the amount of food this bearded fellow eats.  What's more amazing is how many people watch said bearded fellow eat.  Congrats to you all, you're the true hero's.
You should of asked for a sharper knife 🔪
This guy is really making money on this.. hehe. Can't believe
I would love to see a before and after xray of his tummy
100 ounce steak, average cow is 1400 pounds. By my calculations you ate roughly 0.4% of an entire cow.
Did you know you’re in a sidemen reacts video recently!!!!
What does the Diet coke do that water doesn't at that stage of the challenge?
Well done, O` Sonny Jim. The only food eating channel I watch. 👍👍
Asking for a dessert menu after a particularly bigger ass challenge Will never get old to me lol so badass cuz they think he's low-key joking till he fork deep in cheesecake
you need to take an electric carving knife for the next steak challenge🔪🍖🤣
🫡 👏🏼 That was Impressive! “Chet Ripley” approves.
That's insane man great job and can't wait for your next video
Dry steak they need a better cook
I hope beardling’s don’t stick 🤣
Beard army!!!
The only person I know to do a food challenge and relax afterwards with some more food.
looks like you needed a proper steak knife
Velocirapt-beard vs. Cow!
The joke was good
I just came across your channel. After I watched a few videos I was hooked! Subscribed right away! Enjoy the content. I like it better than man vs food!
I think that when they realized your reputation for smashing challenges they literally changed the name of the pub in hopes that you wouldn't find them! Heehee. 'I draw the line at babies!' Another classic Beard zinger. Great job as always.
Well done buddy,
Great win Adam, you did a fantastic job on that humongous steak 👏 👌 👍👍
Wouldn't that be something, Beard going for a new hobby and starting the "Bear meets Wool" channel
Tell you what, that cow was huge, but you were lucky it came with ultra-small sides... never seen such small sides for two people.  Well done Adam... the legend prevails :D
Correct me if I'm wrong but the bloke said the timer starts from when you cut in to the steak..would you not eat the sides first then cut the steak??
WOW BEARD. WOW. bravo
I’d of ate most of that fat, I love beef and pork fat
Swaffham is world famous for its lack of signage and baffling locations on Google maps!! Asking for the desert menu never ever gets old
The Turd must have hurt you wen you went for a dump!!!!😓
Could of given you a steak knife lol
2 mill special!!??
Bro you are an absolute freaking UNIT
An amazing challenge and some really good looking food. I wished I was there at that stunning place of food!!
I can't imagine the jaw pain after
i used to live in swaffham when there was a fireworks factory
No matter how shit my day has been ya always put a smile on my Face lol. That face you pulled when asked for a photo is legendary
45m as duo, 60m solo I believe he said...I know you're a stickler for the rules! ;]
You’re a monster man, I’ve been subscriber for a couple years now, love and support from California 🙌🏼
Beard does not share food !!!
Bit strange referring to your beard as  "a thick furry jumper" but I like it
You absolute beast!
Should’ve used one of those brevel electric knives 🤣
This guys just gets free food
It’s the close up when he’s eating the Dessert that gets me 🤣
u really need to be sponsored by Andrex
The fat is the best bit. 😊
That was impressive, I feel bad for your toilet 🤣 you may need a plumber after this one lol
There's an idea - a bib that looks like your beard
Who the fuck gives anyone a steak and asks them to cut it with a butter knife....
Awesomeness!!!✨✌️🌴
Buy a sharp knife.
That’s a lot of meat. That’s what she said. Poor Ms Beard or lucky? Who knows? LOL
So basically the British don't know how to cook a steak... that looks pretty well done.
VERY impressive (well done)....Just on 3 kgs of steak WoW plus sides....
harald baldr once did a steak challenge in italy vblog, he wasnt aware until @ cashier. too bad ukraine war muted his ytube channel
Or maybe putting Molly on a head-on course with you Adam but I think you can take her down
beardlings lol
I have been watching you for years and thought you might fail this one, purely because I recently had my second child and I can confirm you just ate more than she weighed in steak alone!! 😱😬😂!!
That is an enormous chunk of meat! Holy cow (no pun intended). First person to attempt it solo man, you legend
Damn, well done brother!!
200k views in 3 hours. Good job 👍
And even further make my point Molly Shruyler keeps putting that she's breaking world records but yet none of them are recognized
the thing to your right is a bed warmer
Same as me, cheesecake especially newyork is my go to but chocolate fudgecake with cream is 2nd always!
You really should invest in some pro cutlery for these challenges,  sharp knife for cutting, oversized spoon for cleanup, maybe even some custom condiment squeeze bottles (merch idea too!) call em, the shaving kit.
A nice amount of chips this time, not the normal big bowl full. Well done, great job.
Could've at least give you a steak knife instead of a butter knife.
Would have helped if they gave you a proper steak knife, that butter knife they gave you really put work in
for the civilized world its 2.8kg🙃
I am really making Molly Schuyler fans mad at us both for not giving her the credit I give you not to be mean to her. The  girl can' eat but she still not you or a lot of the other competitive eaters and she's still not ranked as high as you in a lot of the other eaters out there
bro lol your commentary over the top @4:04 you said "30 mins duo, 45 solo" when im sure the landlord said an hour solo and you mentioned these times a few times and they all different haha what a legend!
🤷🏻‍♂️does Adam ignore anything they say. 60 mins for 1 and 45 for a pair. 3 pairs successful out of 50, it’s not like it’s not recorded. How he does these amazes me. Top vids.
no steak knife?
Wow beard !
Good lord, man. 100oz of steak has got to be exhausting on the jaw!  Thankfully, that beautiful slice of double chocolate cake at the end looked amazing.
Anyone else eat their dessert just like Adam?  Exaggerated bite, little smile and a nod towards the fake camera at 10 o'clock?  No?  All righty then!
If John Candy had to eat the fat and gristle, you should too, mate.
Well done Adam great time too bet your jaws ached desert too wow 👏👏👏
dam bro he's definitely a sender full send bro never lift mobbin deep
Love from South Africa. I dont miss this incredible content for anything.
The guy said 45 minutes as a duo and 60 minutes alone, you then changed it to 30 as a duo and 45 minutes as a solo handicapping yourself... we know your the best beard but come on ;) haha
For a man who loves getting a free t-shirt after a successful challenge,  the mind boggles that you wear a big old jumper to the majority of challenges?? 🙈😂😂😂
How are you able to eat so much Mr Beard?
thumbs up for the swathome knitting association
Where do you put it!?
beardlings love it. like comment if ya want us to be called beardlings
don't tell me you recorded this during the heatwave
Well done sir! We need knitted Beard Bibs added to the merch!
This looks like a great place to go, hope to visit soon.
That giant piece of fast was the best looking thing on the plate!
what's up beef army
I saw it, you fought and I liked that! ^^ Good job mah man! And you seem like a real humble guy :)
Fantastic & well done 👏
Well done epic effort love the vids keep them coming your a machine uuutttssscccaaddooooo
Me and my husband always go "ooh the diet coke is coming out". Great challenge, really enjoyed this one 👍
I can look at the mass of the  plate and tell whether or not you can do it after watching so many of your vids.
The fact I thought this might beat you based on eating straight 100oz steak & getting sick of it makes me stand corrected, but that’s crazy bro!
I could never do any of these because I'm allergic to mushrooms.
Dipping the rocket in BBQ sauce 😂
FYI Beard: A bed warmer is passed over the sheets to warm the bed and removed! You don't snuggle down with it for the night! OK??
who eats Rump Steak? possible decent flavor aside, never gonna eat a tough piece of meat
If there were more people like Adam in the world, it would be a greater place.  Love the vids dude.
love your vids keep up the great work
Wait wait wait. That dude works in or for the restaurant and is wesr SANDALS in the establishment?! Id be gone like roadrunner, instantly 😒
That was amazing!!!
Meal should’ve been called “that’s what she said”
I'm a drayman, never delivered to that pub but I recognize the guy from another pub years back.
The knitting group!! 🥺💕💕 too cute!
This man is undefeatable....
Super impressed with this WTG Adam.
I dont know why but I love these videos so much
I'm liking his shoes
When I saw 100oz I choked
Phenomenal
Why didn't they give you a steak knife! What's that for butter?!
The fungus is among us.
I feel full just watching this, great job haha
They are a Close Knitt community 😁
That’s just a peeled cow. It’s massive.   I don’t see enough of the trademark (what I like to hear as) “HOOTS GEDDOOT” on your recent videos.
That’s not a steak that’s a baby cow 🐄🥩😝
I'm just wondering where you put all of it lol
me when I heard Swaffam: Hey, thats me!
Desert always kills me!🤣
Beardlings!! yeeees!!
That steak looks sooo dry! I'm sure it was still good but damn I would have wanted it a bit more juicy
You had an hour not 45. Was 45 for pairs
I was good till you creamed the dessert cake. No hidden innuendo intended.
What the hell is wrong with you bro?
Yeah, guess who just discovered this legend, is absolutely addicted to you videos and is watching hungry all of you videos in one go? Yep thats me! Great channel! You sir, have earned another sub!  Edit: I think its because you are brittish and very polight, and you have a sort of no nonsense kind of videos, better than those over reacting americans. Sorry not sorry
Hey Beard did you create any content from the Nathans hot dog contest?
As if you’re in Norfolk!!!!!!
Chips!
You are by far my favorite mukbanger . When you were here in Georgia I wanted so bad to go see you in person but alas I have no vehicle.  But still you are awesome sauce.
Well done again bearded McBeard Face Adam. You did good as usual. However I consider it sacrilege to not eat the delicious slabs of fat. I would happily forego any tasty dessert for the sheer pleasure of scoffing the fat. I know I'm weird but each to their own eh? Keep scoffing lad. 😊
I don't hear sound and now I do weird
What a cool restaurant they were so polite and accommodating!
He said team 45 solo one hour. That's what I heard 😊
Disliked for not eating the fat. Enjoyed the video though 👍🏾
Methinks that record is going to stand for a very long time.
No wonder it’s so hard to get through the steak and chew it … it’s well done… it’s a challenge to get through any steak of any size cooked like that
I don’t usually comment. But I cannot believe you managed to complete this one! Incredible 😮😮
I worry for your health.
Everything looks so delicious, but the steak looks overcooked.
Out of the Texas heat, into the UK frying pan.
I'm watching you eat this 100 ounce steak and I'm thinking back to John Candy in the movie The Great outdoors where you had to eat a 72 oz steak.
bless those sweet ladies that came and sat behind ye
Eating as much as u do … do u train yourself to ignore the full feeling and it’s about flavour and texture ??
Ok did I hear wrong thought guy said 45 two ppl or 60 mins for one and I thought you said in the commentary 30 and 45 did I hear wrong :D either way great vid 💛❤️💙
That was awesome!
They could of given you a better knife lol
That looked great, don't know how you stomach the breakfast challenges you do but meals like this I can understand.
I dunno, the fat is usually good too, just leave the grissly bits SKA ladies 😀
Is it me or Are doing the stats wrong in the voiceover on purpose bro? It’s was 45 mins or 1 hour for the time and it’s was 3 pairs people completed out of 50 not 4. 😂😂😂 don’t know why I can be arsed to write this comment 🙃
It started out as (45 minutes duo / 60 minutes solo) to (30 minutes duo / 45 minutes solo) and back again?  Hmmm!
Call me a fanny but I completed a 72oz steak challenge last week and was laughed at for taking an electric carving knife. Breezed through the cutting, not so much the chewing still. 😊
Sacrilege! Leaving the fat, that’s the best part of the steak! 😋😂🤣
That a freggin pot roast not a stake
You make John Candy proud!
"Beardlings" made me cringe mate I can't lie. Luckily your skills will give you a pass though. I can't be a beardling though sorry😑. Great vid once again👍🏻
As normal Adam you smashed it !! great challenge, great pub, great staff and customers
That fat honestly looks delicious
I wonder how they react when you win the challange, do they seem upset?, cuz all that meat is for free. They dont expect for someone to win
I love that you dont make super long vids
When the tray came out and it was bowed I thought you were in trouble. Forgive me for doubting you!
Think that's the best one ever fella
How do you find the drive home? Oftentimes you're eating a long way from home, is it a challenge to stay awake?
A legend
Amazing❣️☺️
Christ that’s a lot of meat. I had a 32oz 2 person T-bone at miller and carter one time and I could barely walk afterwards
Should've called it the "Norfolk'n chance steak challenge"  🤣🤣🤣 Well played, Beard.
Beard: "It's almost the size of you mate" Beard: "I won't eat you though don't worry about it" Me: "what if I told you there is a free t-shirt if you do it in under 25 mins?"
Epic😲😲😳😳 please do a video on how you stay so thin😁😊😊
Would love to come see you on your next US tour ... in Colorado :)
Publican sounds like James Corden. Chef looked like Gru 😅
I would’ve asked for some real flat ware.   At least a good knife.     Go buy yourself a big handled sharp knife and three prong sharp fork.   Take with ya for steak challenges.   If they would let ya use them.  Just some thoughts.   Pro eater flat ware.   Come up with your own and sell that shit, mate.
I really wish I could see the portion sizes of the meals you eat, to really get a feel of how far pass human consumption you really go..Because whenever I see you struggling with something, I'm always like (WTH) how big is this thing actually LOL
That thing is meant for five people.
Well done Mr Beard
QUESTION, why You Not use your hands as pizza when doing steak challenges??? knife n' fork so dainty :P
I need to go to sleep after all that food, I'm tired 🤣
Almost at 2 million!
Signature “have you got a dessert”😂😂😂😂
Dear God! That's insane!
Had a flash back from a movie  movie,  great out doors the old 96 er 😄
They should have gave you a proper knife.
Put me down for one of your jumpers when you start knitting bud!
Having an actual steak knife would’ve made the cutting easier for you. I don’t know why they didn’t give you one but you navigated that steak with precision per usual 😎
BIG UP Adam.....desperate Dan size cow challenge nailed .
3kg of meat 🍖- crazy!
Keep these Collabs coming !! Top content
You have been very lucky with the friendlyness of the staff lately.
Love the channel! You really should bring your own Laguiole knife to these steak challenges. It's painful to watch you hack away with substandard blades and even more painful for your jaw!
I watch beard, and then just want to eat with my hands 😄
Typically the sleeper and the bed warmer wouldnt be in the bed at the same time.
Does anyone else remember The Old 96'er from 'The Great Outdoors,' and they made him eat the gristle and fat for the challenge to be complete?
I can't believe you were in Swaffham! Planning to head to the hart and go for the challenge after seeing this!
Awesome, really well done. You really need to go to South Africa for some of the challenges. You will not suffer from taste fatigue from the steaks. I actually thought you might struggle on this one as that steak was huge and looked tough as old boots.
Never gets old
Sheesh! How much pot do you smoke before doing a 2-man challenge then soloing it? Still love the drone footage.
The fats the tastiest bit man
That was absolutely mental 😳 🔥
I always get humbled when I eat and watch you do an eating challenge. I got like 8 cauliflower wings down and I’m already stuffed.
I see what they did. They gave you a butter knife *shake my head*
Well done Adam
Why on earth didn't they give you a decent steak knife and fork! Shocking!
Finally, a knife and fork!  Well done White Hart.
They needed to give him a proper steak knife that was a butter knife
Beard talking about the flavor fatigue. Meanwhile, the sides lay quiet gathering dust. I eat heavy naturally and just cannot imagine going after a meal one thing at a time. blah - Great job and clean beard!
Turaré has entered the chat
Great effort even by Beard standards!
Mrs Beard would love the Tithe barn in Bolton Abbey TO GET MARRIED show her the pictures if you dare! its not cheap lets put it that way lol I have the Unicorn hotel in Skipton and 3 lodges on the Bolton Abbey estate. Its stunning up here in the Yorkshire Dales. If you marry your beautiful Mrs Beard around here I can offer you 10 hotel rooms and 3 lodges that each sleep 4 (Howgill caravans) all for free. No strings or adverts I would expect nothing and give you total privacy just really happy to see a Yorkshire lad doing so well and am rooting for Mrs Beard to get her wedding. Show her the Devonshire Arms at Bolton abbey and show her the Tithe barn. These are two of the most beautiful wedding venues of the North ;)
Surely you had the meat sweats after.
BeardMeatsFood fans are ‘Beardlings’. And I quite like that
It takes 3 days to digest 4oz steak lol
Awesome accomplishment, it did look delicious. Looking forward to the extreme knitting channel 😁
When was the last time you paid for a meal Beard?! 😂 Absolutely nailing this financial crisis!
Adam you and Joel should double team a cow.
That looked an incredibly tasty steak and al that for just £50  seems a cracking buy and try.  Could probably keep me going for a decade.
Yes that's a bed warmer, however you didn't sleep with it in the bed haha.
How about the knitting group on your podcast ?
Unreal that mate.. Legend! 👏🏻
ahhh poor adam...can do 30 chin ups with a 20 kilo weight around his waist...but a knife and fork will drop him to his knees. ;P
A decent steak knife would of helped you knock about 6 minutes off your amazing time @Beard Well done on another great challenge defeated 👍👌💪
You really should have been given a proper steak knife 🔪
I don’t wanna sound gross but the fat is the best part is has all the flavor
I'm a beardling and I never knew until now!
Lol. The ad before your video started with, "Do mushrooms freak you out?"  MUD/WTR (alternative drink product)
Terrible looking steak…apparently wasn’t good either, if you have to ask for barbecue sauce to go with it.
I always stand in awe when you get your FULL TILT BOOGIE ON!  God bless that cow, he found fame in his sacrifice. 👍👍🤗
At least they were sensible portions of the sides for a change!
When I first saw the steak & the fat rind I was thinking of the movie The Great Outdoors where John Candy's character takes on the Old 96er (a 96 oz steak) & is forced to eat the fat & gristle at the end.
All that fat reminds me of John Candy do a steak challenge in the movie The Great Outdoors.
Destroyed it
Amazing?😮
NGL I'd eat the fat too.
Hes a eating machine he gets better everytime well done adam.
Beard, you sure that was beef, because I swear it was barking, anyway that was well done my brother 👏 👍 👌
Norfolking chance😂😂😂😂 brilliant Adam! Simply brilliant. They quite should rename it that! 🥰
What a digestive system and so thin amazing really
Why not just cut a sandwich size bite and just use your hands and bite it? Save yourself cutting so much?
I enjoy eating, especially a jumbo hunk of beef, but eating something that sized would be purely an ordeal.
So pleased to see you travel down to our part of the country😊 Good old Norfolk 🤙 Will have a word with the boss of the local chippy for you👍
Looks like 20 oz of it was fat. Hereford Texas is the home of the best beef in the world. Also Ft. Worth has the best steak houses in the world. You went to neither one.
Thats one massive piece of cow
Ment for two but ive never been into sharing 😂😂
Dude, my dog gets a Sirloin once a week. I argued my missus down from Ribeye! LOL
That fat looked like the best part 😅
Beard in Partridge county,superb. Who invented the skip?
I would’ve asked for a sharp knife
You know its bad when you're using a knife and fork 😂🍴🍽
Could of gave you a steak knife instead of a butter knife 🔪😂
That was a lot though sheesh
The desert part never gets old.
That is impressive.
I've seen you haven't taped anything from your new home studio lately , with Misses Beard !!
I've seen you haven't taped anything from your new home studio lately , with Misses Beard !!
This man is inspiring.
You're so down to earth, my sort of person. Love ya vids, not so much usa. ones though!!😊   Jaw ache out of this world! 🤣
BEARD I JUST CANT UNDERSTAND WHERE THE HELL YOU PUT IT??BLOODY AMAZING FELLA!!!👍🏻😁
I really thought you'd abandon dessert on this one, you seemed sooo full at the end!
you got the times wrong 1hr for 1 or 45mins for 2 just saying :)
What is it with Brits that everything has Mushrooms? That steak looked awesome though.
Northfolk in chance 😂😂😂😂😂 brilliant
At least it’s not THAT Much mushrooms 😂
3 mill by the end of august
You are some guy Adam lad pure animal 🤙🏼 hope all is well
they could of gave you a steak knife
Brother i really appreciate you & respect to your hardwork. I have seen all your video's but i just can't understand one thing how your doing this types of food challenges. If i eat 1.1/2 Burger my stomach gets full & feel like vomiting. Thank you so much Brother your always Awesome & Real Hero of food eating without wasting it. I really appreciate you & respect to your hardwork. Love You FOREVER ☝️🥤🥨🥖🍔🍟🍲🍱🍖😍🥩🍗🍕🌭🥐🥞🍧🍷👍🏻
Was it  45 MIN SOLO LIMIT OR 60 MIN?  Sorry caps.  Get with it Beard!  :)  All hail the Beard!
Welcome to Norfolk. Their all nuts in the sticks you know. I'd have done the fat and left the rest. Superb effort that
6.25Lbs of steak HA!!! Beard was not even taxed , He is is a beast !! Best part  Do you have a desert menu ?
''meant for teams of two? I've never really been into sharing though''  I almost chocked on my snacks from laughter :')
But regardless was amazing
That’s a hunk of meat! Way to go 👍🏻💜
Cape needed!
That looked hard work.
I did a 200oz steak challenge with a couple friends. The hardest part was cutting the steak!! In future I will definitely take my own (sharp) steak knife!!  Well done beard!!  FYI:- the steak house was called the Cattleman’s steak house.
Only guy I watch the full adverts for.
Legend
I see most of it underneath the beard! 🤣 great job brother man!
How can you eat so much so fast?  I would have to take a crap ten mins in. ...
Why didn't you use a stake knife?
a real stake knife would help!
Reminds me of The Great Outdoors when John Candy ate that giant steak. “Hey can you throw in a couple hats for the kids???”
Wish I'd of known I don't live far from Norfolk I would of loved to of met you x
Next time bring a rechargeable filet knife!? 📢
Love that the cooks knew ya and were talking about you,  and knowing you were going to ask  for dessert. Also looking forward to you new side channel...beard meets yarn.
Since I've been watching beard and trying to eat more I'm actually eating less.  I can't get near him n I'm 6ft 3 and 22 stone of power lifter.its unreal what you pack away.
He said an hour on y own an 45 a team lol
I NEED A SHARPER KNOFE!! GREAT JOB 👍 RESPECT!!!
You absolute animal. MOT ALAW 👍👍
Dude why not eat your steak with the sides as well? A full force attack 🍴🏆🥇
The "do you have a dessert menu' joke never gets old...untill we see the behind scenes in the toilet...
Every drone shot looks like the neighborhood from Willy Wonka. I think I saw Charlie's house.
Need an epidural in the morning
lmao beardlings i dig it
With that handle of a slab of fat, I'm surprized you didnt just pick it up and eat it...lol
Whoohoo😅
What a great host!! Happy guy to give away 100 oz steak !!
Solid delivered Adam!
You should seriously consider using kitchen sheers instead of knives to cut large cuts of meat like this.
Tip for the next who takes on this steak: BRING YOUR OWN STEAK-KNIFE !!!
legend
Just under 2million subs COME ON BEARD
ITSH TOO LOUD!
Fat should of been included
I'm impressed.  I'm a steak guy, but I doubt I could eat more than a third of that steak before I'd tap out.  I know I couldn't eat the sides after roughly 2 lbs of steak.  Love your videos!
Come on let’s get him to 2 million! Tell your friends
Id have an issue just eating all the sides in one sitting, good grief!
Dipping salad in bbq sauce, gotta be one of the most major wtf moments ive seen so far in your vids
I thought they said 45 as a pair 60 solo...ya got meat fog there beard ? Lol
That fat is the best part.. What a waste...
They could have given you a good steak knife? Another great beard video. 👍👍👍
Dang boy!  As Sir Lewis Hamilton would say : "Still Rising"  Although. in your case it might actually be "fermenting".  That's impressive, holy muck!  edit : Also ... challenge Olivier Richters (Netherlands) .... do it already! (or do his daily intake?)
Next week…. Beard knits bib.
I've never seen a steak that big in my life!!
💯💯👌
Does Mr beard tip if he doesn't have to pay up?? Always wondered
Nearly at 2 millieeee go on son
You’re one of the best. I enjoy watching your videos. Great job getting through this challenge.
It seems it would be easier and more efficient  to take bites of the other foods along. with the bites of meat. Especially bites of foods less desirable. But seeing the size of that beef I'm feeling sorry for your colon. I also feel they kind of sabotage you by providing a crappy dull steak knife. A good knife should slice easily through that.
jises that steak was insane :D good job mate
The fat is the best bit!
The chap (manager?) seems like a top guy. You’ve had some great hospitality on the last 2 videos!
What a beast.
when it comes to eating you are amazing
How just how man
Reminds me of the old 96er challenge from "The Great Outdoors" with  the late John Candy. Cheers from Toronto.
Ah.....welcome to the heart of Norfolk!
LETTTSGETTIT
First time I saw this channel I was amazed how fast he could eat such an enormous amount of food. Finishing everything. Now, I have binge watched a lot of videos and everything seems so "normal" lol.
Super eater!
Plus dessert!!!   A girl!!!
The fat is the best part! Hope you brought it home to Mrs. Beard ;) Well done!
Meat sweats incoming.
That looked like a big ol' toughy!  +1 Like
good jobb!!=P
That's not a steak, it a roast. A very large roast......
So, in case it was a test to make sure someone watched all of the video. You mis-spoke about a few things. Only 3 have ever won they said, you did say you are the only one to try it solo, and doubles get 45 minutes, you said 30 and solo gets 1 hour you said 45 minutes. I paused at that part so back in I go lol.
Huge fan. But your so slow and spend more time talking in your videos. I’m happy to try you on a challenge? Worth a video 😀
She ate 144 oz. Of steak w/ sides !!
You seemed like you were having quite the experience with that cake!
That was a monster. Way to crush it. Looked really good. So did the fudge cake with cream. Good luck knitting. Was fun to watch. Great video
In the vid: 1 person 60 min, 2 persons 45 min.  Voiceover: 1 person 45 min, 2 person 30 min. Raising the STEAKs for yourself, very nice 😉  (ill see myself out)
hilarious. awesome vlog
7:44 ... That's now you use it ... shortly before bed time you run it all over between the sheets (giggity)  and then once it's cooled a bit from that you leave it in the centre ..   Then take it out before hunkering down, for the night. In short you don't sleep with it in the bed.
My favorite part is the "Crazed MeatMan Eyes" looks in those photos you were taking. Hilarious! The knitting made me think of A Hard Day's Night - "my wife knitted this sweater" - John's response: "I bet she knitted you."
I want steak
You don't impress...a girl ate (2) of the 72 ounce steak  challenge in Amarillo Tx....in time limit...
You are so freaking wild bud! Good job
The fat is the best tasting parting of a steak. I could make a fat sandwich with a dab of steak sauce and eat it all day long.
The beard needs a tidy up, you've probably lost a few sausages in there
You left some lettuce to barbeque sauce bowl! XD
Beardlings, whoopaaa!
They should have provided you with a proper steak knife.
Every time I think you're stumped... you get it in :O well done again Beard!!!
More knitting crew collabs please! 🙌🏼
You went to Swaffam on your own? No security? But people know where you are, you're a soft target.
i dont eat beef anymore but that meal looked amazing and it would feed my family for 2 days haha, amazing! the people were so friendly too, staff and customers.
I always end up ordering silly amounts of food from a takeaway when watching these challenges 🐷
Them flip flops  🙀🙀🙀🙀
Steak challenge with a butter knife. Adam ask for a steak knife.
I get hyped when I see a new upload after a heavy gym session. Only to watch him eat delicious food, while I eat my chicken and rice 😂
My mom recently became a fan of your channel too, and she knits. I sent her this vid and she said “I’d be happy to knit him something”, so just say the word and she’ll make it happen 🤣. Great vid as always, Beard! 🤘🤘🤘
🤢🤢
Man your videos legitimately make me happy inside!
they only used it to warm the bed before sleeping... I think
7:26 At this point that much steak left would feed my 3 kids and I, for a 3 days! ... Not kidding! ... but yeah we aren't used to a lot of meat so it lasts a long time :)
Always like the videos where a giant steak is at stake.
4:05 it’s 45 minutes as a pair and 60 solo I’m sure he said
Freaking amazing.
I will never tire of the reaction people have when you finish a challenge and then ask for a dessert menu.
It looks as chewy and tough as an old boot sole....was it that way or moist and tender?
Makes me proud to be part of the Beard Army, as always!  Keep up the great work Adam.
Snyggt som vanligt.
Hmm 🤔 why they didn’t give you a steak knife 🤷🏾… Good shit my guy 👍🏾💪🏾
I think I would watch you learn to knit.  Dare you.
As my dog and I are watching this eating New York strip
THIS MF HAD DESSERT!!
I’ve been binge watching some of these, past few days , while fasting . Might’ve gained a few pounds ..
Confirmed beard could eat a whole human baby
I always gauge the messiness by his glasses that he drinks from. Well done, this was rather cleaner then your normal videos. Love the vids man, keep it up.
Heck i think you even managed to stop a heated knitting debate on top of the W lol.
Man a steak challenge video makes me hungry the most.
That looked like a proper challenge. You even seemed to struggle a bit, most unusual. What a gigantic steak that was!
3:59 The fat is the best part!!  I love it with sat mostly fat and 20% meat, on each fork bite! :)
BEARD DAY! BEARD DAY! BEARD DAY! Awesome job and that was amazing. I'm not a huge fan of steak but you did great!
Beard mate,so close to 2 million subs now. I hope you’re watching when you hit the 2m you deserve it bro. I feel like you’ve saved me so many times mentally and I’m one man so there’s probably a lot you’ve helped over the years. Roll on the 2-3 and 4 million subs mate. I do my best to highlight you to the world. Big up to you and josh for the podcast too. I feel like you do a lot more for us than you realise. I praise and thank you. Let’sgetit and keep it coming.👍👍👍
100 oz steak and then u get that absolute tiny piece of cake lol
Hey Adam, I've been watching your videos since the OG days and thankyou for all the content you create. Keep being awesome and the winning streak 🤞🏼.
Beard... You know that challenge is a perfect one for you to team up with the shuts and smash it as a double act, with a time that'll Stand for a long time 👍. Keep up the entertainment pal.
Lots of fun again. 2.835 Kilograms
BEAST
That looked steak-alicious!! Its not quite the same but I always took into my tea on an evening when watching your videos! Supporting you on the sidelines hahaha! Great video again though Beard! 👏🏻🐄🐮
Animal
A proper steak knife would've helped. Yeesh.
They would actually put it under the mattress
Good one 👍
I typically don't doubt you Beard, but that steak looked massive, and the mushrooms! Keep killing it man, and thanks for the content!
You should carry portable fan for where start swet.
Swaffham Knitting Association LOL Great video as always Adam!
They gave you a dull steak knife. Kristian, keep a couple of sharp ones back for these events.
Wasnt that a butter knife? WTF
No steak knife.   Cheeky!
"Breadlings" lol you breado
Have you ever Failed.?
Great job. The eyebrow raise when anal was mentioned was a particular highlight.
dont think they actualy slept with the bed warmer in the bed with them , i think it was used to warm the bed then removed , though the large handle nudge nudge wink )
Wow! Nice steak, but seriously who gives you 100oz steak and a butter knife! Smells like sabotage lol
Once again Adam, you simply amazed me. Well done!!
Thanks for the inspiration beard I just completed my first food challenge ever and won $3000 for the best time to eat 10 donuts. I used a few of your techniques and they proved to be great. 💪🏾💪🏾
But, but ,but the fat is the best part mate you can't eat steak without eating the gristle that is 'like eating cake without frosting ... that's blasphemy, a mortal sin.... ARRRGGGG THE HUMANITY!!!!! “If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding! How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat!” =o dipping greens in BBQ sauce priceless....
The amount of food you can eat in one sitting beard is unbelievable it’s like you are a super hero eater lol
That steak looked gorgeous and the bed pan was taken out of the bed before you got in 😊
Well done Adam
My missus is like "Why's he leaving the fat??"  She would eat that.
Biggest shock was you asked for sauce!
I love how you get all the numbers from from the time to beat to how many pairs have actually completed it 😂
Well done shoulders back chin up you absolutely smashed that and not a drop on your beard. Your the game changer in my eyes well done
You could have done every bit bro   we both know it 🤢,,,,,ahhhh fk it what you gonna do that fat looked so good ,it probably would've cut your show short by afew decades so we can let that go brilliant your a machine I'm a skinny dude you could mix some really educational info in with your vids for we with digestive systems,how do I put good wight on two min of your time could save me two decades of my life ,Pooh man that looked so delicious ✌️👍
😂the old wiggle wiggle wiggle always get me.
Man I'm full just watching this.full kudos beard 👏
That fat is the bomb. Wouldn't be leaving that me.
Wow your amazing at the 100 oz steak  plus the always dessert.well done ✔
✨Beard god💪✨
that's a rump roast it's got to be tuff
BEARDLINGS! I love it!
I've seen more than a few of your giant steak challenges Mr Beard and have come to the conclusion that you need to lug around a decent knife and a Mr Beard sized spoon. It really looked like your fingers and arms were about to sieze up at one point where it seemed that instead of cutting the steak you were sawing it. My mind never fails to boggle when I realise that my usual steak would be 5 - 6 oz therefore you are munching your way though 20 of my size meals AND the side dishes.... Well done Adam, another great job and lovely to see the genuinely pleased staff and customers.
This is one I could probably do.  Maybe!
BeardMeatsFoodMeetsWideAngleLens
The ladies offering to teach you how to knit is just the best.
You said the times wrong haha it was 45 for pair not 30 and an hour for solo not 45
That would have been a good one to do with your sister to get her a win.
Jesus wept. I am 6'5" and weigh 21 stone. That steak had more fat on it then I have on me.
@BeardMeatsFood  Congrats🎉🎉 I wonder if a knife company would make you a special steak slicing knife that you could take to your state challenges to make it easier to cut because that knife looked like he was a butter knife LOL I'm a retired butcher and chef you need a 6 inch boning knife to carry with you for steak challenges.✌💪👍👨‍🍳🎅🚌🌻👍
Nice one Adam that looked savage! Loving your videos and the commentary is always brilliant. Keep up the good work
How was knitting?
Beast
To be fair i would happily buy my dog a steak (he'd appreciate it more than i would) And he would have eaten the fat and that steak in about 3-4 minutes 😁
Hi beard. Gentlemen for steak? I’m not sure about gentleman. The only one to try it yourself Let’sgetit beard. Gave you watched Austin powers? I eat babies! Mmm beef army.😋🤤
Great job !
The fats the best bit!
Reminds me of John candy im the great outdoors lol
“Some kind of foliage” 🤣
Nice banjo in the background!
you sir are a beast
Knitting lady in the background: "Why is he talking to his camera? Is he daft?"
@BeardMeatsFood Mate, I thought she was gonna knit your beard. I'm sure they were talking about it 😂
Legend
i thought he said 45 mins team... 60 min single
Dude... get a steak knife. ;)
This reminds me of the "Old 96er" from the movie The Great Outdoors. 😆
I did this challenge it was no joke ! However me and my brother had to eat the fat !
Love it! Should have definitely asked for a proper steak knife though man!
Nice staff made this challenge a pleasure to watch .
I never thought I’d fall in love with a man with a beard 😍😂😂
Meant for 2 people? That would have fed a small village for a fortnight.  Awesome job again Mr beard 👍
I hope someone shows this video to those sweet knitting ladies! I bet they'd get a kick out of it.
It's 2.8 kilos. Closer to 6 pounds
Looks dryer than the Mojave from here.
Does this mean we are going to get a new youtube channel, BeardKnitsFood?
It looked like fred Flintstone steak
They just brought out half a cow
why don't u eat the steak with your bare hands and eat directly from the steak? Cutting the steak takes so much time and effort.
This guy takes there's always room for dessert to another level.
Beard, how do you mess up the times when he told you it was 1 hour solo and 45 for 2. That's why you are my favorite skinny pants wearing, challenge winning food smasher!
20 minutes with a knife and fork, now that is an achievement.
Right on man 👍🏼 Congrats on being the first person to complete that challenge solo. Respect ✌🏼
I watch your videos while I crochet 🤣
The fact that he ordered dessert after 🤣🤣🤣
Hey beard that steak looked like a slab of concrete or a massive rock lol 😂
It could be the knife man. A nice sharpe quality steak knife should just slide right through it.
Imagine the turd after that
No way man. A canne believe you done that beard. Honestly that was massive. A no your good at competitive eating but a genuinely thought no no no. Well done. A comment at start of video say you won’t do it but a stand corrected. Props to you for smashing that steak n sides.  🧔‍♀️ lol
Omg no chance beard! I’m watching now, good luck I think you’re gonny need it…
Swaffham, and you spoke (potentially) to one of my biker mates outside Pedlars cafe, not been there in a bit, would have been great, but weird to meet the beard 😂👍
How can you not like this video or this man......!!??  LEGENDARY AS ALWAYS !!!! Respect from Montreal
Youre a freakin beast dude
As one beard to another love your videos. At 72 your videos reminds of when all you can buffets we're not an offer but a challenge.
I love how he always get a dessert after eating.
I used to not be able to finish meals and weighed less than 100 lbs as a 30 year old. After watching him, he inspired  me to learn to eat more in 1 sitting and gained about 40 lbs. This is the best I've ever felt, especially not looking like a skeleton so he saved me big time
Dude eats literally every other food with his hands, except steak; proceeds to complain about his fingers hurting. Eat it with your hands you dunce! Proceeds to eat it with his hands :facepalm:
Adam, why aren't you fat like Randy? 😉
At the beginning they said 2 people 45 minutes one person 1 hour then you said 2 people 30 1 person 45 minutes. So what is it Adam?
4am laying in bed watching a bearded pom eat a steak. Life choices.
Truly impressive to double a feat most two person teams fail.
They should have given you a sharper knife!
Bro are you using a butter knife to cut that beast? 😳 😅🤣
I would love to know the calorie count of the 350ml of BBQ sauce he got on top.
Least they could do is give you decent cutlery 😂
Fantastic as always what a hunk of meat your poor hand nearly dropped off xxxx bless you 🙏 😁🤗💪👌👍
all that with a butter knife, dear god! nice job
That challenge should be called the bog buster !
Lol. When you pitch the utensils and just start in on it with your paws! Primative Adam is the best.
I've been there sadly with the hands hurting from cutting and cutting. It is the worst
Thankfully u don’t have to eat the fat cuz it takes so long to chew
Give the man a sharp knife! Subtle restaurant cheat there....
Beards Knitting channel when?
I would've did it with a partner and had them just cut it up while I eat
The brass pan full of coals were just to warm your cold bed before you got in, you didn’t sleep in the bed with it.
You should ask for an electric knife for Christmas.
Good to see that it was nearly all steak and not also mountains of fries.
I like seeing nothing but tripods in front of the table letting you know Mrs. Beard is forced to sit at another table eatin garlic bread bites and scrolling on her phone for an hour+ lmaooo
Well done that man 💪
" Makes ya proud to be British " 🎊🎉🎊🎉  What a great channel this is.🥰
Great service BeardMeatsFood. I always know where to go when I think shit I'm going to break my diet. I was just imagining how nice a steak meal would be, not now. The pain in his eyes and that face after the reality of having to chew more times than someone who has just got back from Ibiza has put me right off. Thank you Adam it never fails. Also if he ate the weight of an entire baby, surely that would mean he actually ate a nursery full of children. I mean he wasn't eating bones or anything just meat, the bloody savage
Adam you are a beast. I've thoroughly loved watching through your videos and seeing you take on all these challenges, but this by far was the master class on eating. you destroyed that challenge.  i particularly enjoyed that look into the camera to tell us all how much you were enjoying the last of those pub chips.  Cheers!
Great achievement Adam. But you about buggered all the numbers at the beginning of your voice over. 🤣🤣🤣 Man that was impressive!
I love watching your video's, and never doubt your ability. Although it has just occured to me that 90%+ of people taking the challenge fail, i think on failed attempts hosts should contribute towards foodbanks as it really does just waste food
Do a cheat day
The old 96er 🤣🤣 IYKYK
You’re fantastic man..love your jolly attitude throughout..and asking for the desert menu is always epic..your fan following has reached India🤟
I’m guessing that time is going to stand for quite a long time. That was one hell of a challenge well done my man 👏👏👏👏
I'm just gonna get on my soapbox for 2 secs and say people like the bloke who served you are proof that hospitality is a SKILL. And I hate that it's considered a minimum wage 'unskilled' job and people probably treat him and his colleagues like crap all the time cus theyve never worked a real job in their life. He seems like a top bloke. Kudos to him, he brought a lot to this challenge and I'm sure many patrons evenings out as well!
Cant you have your own knife, sharp?
No way this will be the first time I’ve ever said you won’t do it beard. A want you to do it but it’s massive. Lol. I’m rooting for you pal. Good luck
Them giving you a butter knife just adds to the challenge
Asking for a dessert and actually EATING one after a gargantuan food challenge is THE BEST!  I am a brand new subscriber and I've been going back and watching so many challenges and loving every one.  I love your genuine humble attitude but THAT BEARD THOUGH...jealous of that beast!  Keep up the awesome content and whenever you find yourself in the middle of America, come to Jethro's in Des Moines and smash the Adam Emmenecker Challenge.  Cheers
The fucking King!
Great video as always Beard…sooo all they had for you was that butter knife to use?
Mr beard Mr beard I don't know where you put it another great job
My jaws ache in sympathy. Also, originating from Suffolk, it's amazing what those North folk can dredge out of the Broads.. It's their webbed feet that make them fierce fisherfolk.
I just miss being young and having a metabolism so I can have a hamburger without gaining weight
And he sat in my usual seat 😅😅, no idea where he put it all!! 😁😁
Oo, I like being called a ‘beardling’. Do it again.
You should have mrs beard to help you out when your done
"We're gonna need plenty of lubricant to get this down"...that's what she said.
that cake at the end ohhmg
bruh what id crush this
Great stuff Beard! Closing in on 2million subscribers, feels like yesterday you hit 1million! All the best mate 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Brilliant Adam! That looked amazing.😋
That's not a steak it's a roast! I like that they gave you a butter knife to cut it with🤣
didnt the guy say 1 hour solo 45 mins for duos?
Adam Adam Adam , I’ve watched your videos for ages. And that’s the first time I genuinely thought I could have done better. Pmsl. Well done on the win Time to practice the maths fella 🤦‍♂️😁😇
NGL beard, little disappointed you trimmed all the fat off instead of eating it!
you ever find a piece of food a week later in your beard?
a nice bit of fat on a steak can be really nice. though through the video i cant quite decide if that fat looks nice and crispy, or soggy and anaemic.
That’s a hole cow
Norfolkinway you crushed it !😂
That looked amazing!
If the next video isn't footage of you learning how to knit with those old ladies, then I'm removing my subscription
You can do it I know you can
Beardo is a fantastic blackhole for food
DO Austrian Burger Challenge at XXL Leopoldauer Alm ...
Such Friendly People at that place
Keep eating I really enjoy your shows but wears mrs beard miss her also
Loved it! Especially the chocolate cake at the end!
Yay Beard!!! 🥩 Great work, and we’ll be waiting to see your first knitting project!  Good hand, finger and wrist training for strength. 👏
'...and our hero Beard spent the rest of his day learning how to knit courtesy of some sweet grandmas.'
A Bedpan Bed Warmer!
Beast Mode
It's tuff an dry 😂😂🤣
Big big respect Mr Beard that was unbelievable. Think you need to invest in a rechargeable carving knife 👍👍👍
Reminds me of old reliable red Berkeley off the Simpsons😂
You done lost your damn mind with this one! This one was crazy, you’re the goat 🐐
Nice
As the landlord of the pub I can honestly say adam is the nicest person you could ever hope to smash your steak challenge. Thanks for taking the extra time to speak to the team and our customers
you gonna eat the underlayment?.....that looks like some good wax paper.
Awesome
Thats a bed wamer thay take it out of bed before thay get in to bed
Bro was so wrong in the commentary… 3 people have completed and the time allowed for one person is 60 minutes … lmao I found that funny
1 hour to complete not 45 mins .. 2 people it is 45 mins .....
That sly look to the camera at 10:36  hahah
They thought he was joking about dessert. Nice.
Legend lol
Do 500$ breakfast challenge in restuarant
Doesn't look like ARUGALA, more just mixed salad greens.
No way someone can eat this much, he’s hiding it in his beard somehow.
You cutting that with a butter knife?
You must have a great metabolism. When I was a kid I could eat 2 whole large pizzas. Now I can barely eat half a medium.
Beard you smashed that challenge Awesome congratulations you never disappoint your a trip with the dessert menu
Absolute beast.
The meat sweats were kicking in 😂 great job man 🍻
bro Ur video ,Remember of movie from 80s (the great outdoors) steak challenge
Beardlings? Ha love it
I enjoy watching Beard eat even though my sense of taste and smell had been destroyed first by  a stroke and later by covid. I now eat only because I get hungry, but am unable to enjoy food anymore. I need to go by memory of what something tasted like before in order to eat. It might be more accurate to say that everything has a different taste now, if I can even detect its flavor.Cilantro is something I lo
Swaffham 👀👀 was near me
You should bring a cordless electric knife !
I just discovered you today and I am binge watching ur vids great stuff
At first glance I thought the big rind of fat on the steak was a  battered cod! I thought “That’s weird”. Lol
Damn, they could have given you a Steak knife to cut thru that sucker instead of that table knife!   That's why it ws such a PITA to make any headway.  Truth Be Told, that's probably the plan to make it take longer to cut up the steak... Still, well done Adam!  Great video, and can't wait for the next one.
You don't sleep with it it's just put in your bed to warm it up then you remove it before you get in
Knife & Fork though Adam?
its so good to see beard putting the effort with the quality and edition of the video. Very cool man, very cool to see Beard going hard, Im happy.
Thank you for another great upload
Right after I comment why using the knife and fork still you stop using the knife and fork and go to the hands good show mate
A sharp knife would be handy.
I have a friend that for whatever reason never feels full. He has to closely monitor how much he eats. Does Beard have the same thing? Has he ever mentioned anything like that?
Videos are always just that bit more enjoyable when the restaurant employees are positive and engaging. Probably does a good bit of PR for them too 👍🏼
I love your videos so much. <3
I don't think you made a video yet that can be compared to the vid you made a few years back at the "007" style hotel.. actually if my memory is correct they sent you an invitation....like fk dude....between all the meat .. savoury's and pastries...that was unfknreal 🤟😎
thats crazy and ive watched ya do a lot things well done
They checked you out and we're waiting for the dessert taunt. ;D
That steak knife had a small handle. That probably made your hand ache from using it to cut the steak.
I like the video even before seeing it, ik it would be fucking great
all i can say is ..legend
Was looking forward to this :D
What a fantastic place and VERY welcoming. Congrats on the beef baby btw 😄
Interesting History, the Coal Pan was put in prior to going to bed to heat up the feet area.  It was then removed before actually getting into bed.
Well done sonny gem
Go on Adam! Love your Vids...that one was epic! Don't envy you tomoz mate 😆
The fat is the best bit
Beard. Pot of mushrooms look nice. Like good old Norfolk hospitality. Try the White horse in Neatishead. Best place on the broads mate
Wow...good job  beard,  u can really eat!
Bravo and Congratulations MrBeard on another Fantastic Victory! You know this reminded me of the movie "The Great Outdoors" with the late Great John Candy. In the movie he eats the Old 96er, but the chef said he had to eat the fat! OMG, that is a CLASSIC! Congratulations again!
Finally came to Norfolk ! Nice one
The place is empty while using the knife and fork you usually just use your hands pick up the meat and eat But any kind of sauce does help get it down good strategy except in your case a hot sauce or mushroom sauce
did man actually dip rocket into bbq sauce !!!!!! 😱
Does this establishment not have steak knives?
FFS Adam if i’d of known you had come to Swaffham I’d have come and bowed before your being.
Don't understand, your introduticion. With, your groining? Bye 👋. From california
I cant imagine handling that much red meat in my system, christ alive. good on ya beard!
I don't understand why they didn't give you a real steak knife that look like a weak ass little butter knife to cut that steak with you need a real knife would definitely made it a lot easier on your arm
YOU  ARE A  BEAST!!!!!
Big fan and you are a legend! You probably get this question a lot but Do you think you could go back to a “normal diet”. I know you you’ve talked about how you do these challenges but would you find it easy to go on a standard 2k calorie diet?
They could have given you a bigger slice of cake!!
why not ask for a bigger/sharper knife?
The Man
I always watch these more when I'm dieting and in training. It helps me weirdly enough 🤣
Dude that is badass!!!
Had anyone tried this challenge before solo ? ;)
You're my eating hero dude, keep up the great work  😁🤘
You are a beast mate. I'm a new subscriber, has there ever been a challenge that has beat you
Has anybody ever noticed how the camera angles are made to make things look miles bigger than they are? Obviously what he eats will be massive potions! But he try’s to make everything look so much bigger for more views. More views = more money but it’s quite annoying trying to con people
Delighted your channel is absolutely flying. I’ve been around since you had very few subscribers. Great to see you succeed pal
Am a beardling now I belong 🙃
Overcooked steak and no proper meat knife, wtf.
Good lad. Didnt let us down by missing the dessert. That always cracks me up when you ask for that :)
seemed decent place that, go back and do the whole dog menu! lol
Can you for once beard say do you have a stomach pump
So weird seeing a sunny UK in the vids
Jethro Tell !
Beard….I live in Norfolk VA and one of my fantasy football team names is Norfolkinchance!!! So when u said that to the waiter I fucking lost it haha!!
Rumor has it he's still there knitting now and signed up for their club!
Someone get that man a steak knife for the love of god!
The eyebrows raise when he said “anal” had me laughing big beard!
and shame on you for the condecebding bastard comment about knitting
New videos yeeeeyyyy...
Did the White Hart got replaced by the Tottenham?
Fat is flavour
man got all the info wrong in the voice over LOL
10:35 the little eyebrow raise at 'anal' made me laugh haha. Good job Beard
WOLF HOWLS STEAK
Monster
That’s bigger than what John candy ate in the great outdoors
That’s bigger than what John candy ate in the great outdoors
Great giant win Beard🙏👍😁
If I ate that much meat I will be in a coma for probably 3 weeks
This time I would have totally understood if you wouldn't have gotten a dessert. Ballsy move.
Just up the road from me! You done well👌🏼
"Nor- fork 'n  chance steak challenge" Groan!....Rim Shot. Actually Beard, pretty funny.
I had my doubts, but I knew you could do it.
. . . . "Aaah, That Was Nice!" 🤣👌                                          - Beard -
They should I give you a proper steak knife
Idk how you eat that much man… I’m never disappointed with your videos lol…
"can you knit me a bib" 🤣 i think you could do with one sometimes mate lol....what a great friendly place that was too!
Great job, as usual. What lovely landlord/staff, and that knitting group were so friendly and supportive. I wonder if they've come up with a "Beard Bib" design! 🤔🧔😉
I wonder how all of you "professional eaters" will feel when the world elite implements world hunger into their plan and people all over the world die of hunger? Consider this before it is too late and it may be too late in 3 months
They cheated you with that ugly tough looking hunk of meat, and gave you a butter knife to cut it with? Blasphemy
This is no way to eat a Pichanha
First challah in Long Island, now you’re using “chutzpah” properly. You need to find a giant matzah ball soup challenge!!
I said it before… next time bring your own knife. A sharp knife will make the cutting of the stake a lot easier and it will make your stake taste better. 👍
Literally how!!!!
A bed Pan.,😂
Careful mate! they might nit your beard, also did you tell the baby your not going to eat him? Haha, 😂
I think this is the toughest challenge yeah, taking on food ment for 2, well done Beard
my 2 girls 11 and 13 wouldnt get away with leaving lamb fat on their plates
Hey Beard, love your vids, have you seen this channel? Ashifa ASMR. Not a speed eater but she puts it away, anyway I’m a minute in on this, good luck!
One onion ring to go  ? You know where you can shuff it !
The knitting club support was so blooming adorable!
Great job Mr. Beard! Even beat the two person time!  I would buy my dog a good ole meaty bone or so!
Nice to see a part of a cow wqs wasted on this bellend
I don't know how you pulled it off, but I really enjoyed the collab.
Thanks for the vid you have a blessed Soul Adam have a blessed day and blessed life doing what you love and thanks for all you do for us Adam
The fat is the best bit! I would have polished that off if I was watching you 💪
Awesome 👏🏻 well done 👍🏻
It's meant especially for the hungry  , poor people in our society who have to go without . DISGUSTING .
Get that Jaw working! I thought he said 45min for a pair, 60min for a solo job.
but still i would rather eat the parts you threw away.. and this from a guy that drinks the sauce for waste
I doff my cap to you.....what a challenge and what a legend 👏🏼 🙌🏻
I have to correct you Mr Beard and you can correct me. You said it's 45 minutes to complete challenge solo and yet the gentleman said 1 hour.
Not sure you'd get the same views for knitting tutorials Adam 😉
did they actually teach you to knit? Does this mean we can expect a secondary channel from you called BeardKnitsHoody?
Why didn't they give you a steak knife?
Love your vids we watch them all one thing that bugs us is you finish your video to quick as soon as you get your desert that’s it, let’s have more of the after meal people that are watching you and the owners response as well as people in the restaurants, it would be great to see you take on someone in the place you are doing the challenge just to see how you would demolish a normal eater 👍👍👍
They give the man a butter knife 🤦‍♂️ Bruh fair play on what you do eh man you eat well etc
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What a Legend Adam lol
pretty sure my sister was smaller than that
Adam been awhile hope the family are good and as always you never fail to deliver   legend
I know he had a hard time at the toilet that night!
yes that is a jibe
Stellar
Fair play, best yet!!
Ayy man …. Come to india, try the Bahubali Thali or the 10ft. Dosa. That’s some challenge!!! 🔥
Hmmm. Steak. What's for breakfast...
the fat is the tastiest part, you must be vegan to throw it away
Beard if you were the man v food guy you would win every challenge love the vids keep going!!!
A proper knife would be nice.
damn. the staff was like, 50 pairs have attempted and only 4 made it. bearded steps in solo and smashes it... well done
MORE NAUSEATING GLUTTONY . ALL THIS TYPE OF VIDEO SHOULD BE BANNED FROM YouTube .
we are all waiting everytime you finished a meal for you to ask if they got any dessert =) that's just bad ass! you need to do it everytime... its your thing beardman! =)
Did you take them up,on the knitting offer? 😂😂
I was hungry till I watched this, now I’m full from watching this😂😂
That’s a lot of meat 👌
Next an entire roasted side of beef.
6lbs 4oz is more than a viable weight for a baby, it's heavier than the average baby born in Pakistan or Bangladesh
You’re so sweet and kind to everyone.  Congratulations on another win!  🏆
Adam is a beast who demolished the mound of meat😅. Well done
Hmmm the guy a few minutes into the video said 45 min in a pair, 60 min alone. Then Adam said 30 min a pair, 45 min alone in his commentary. Then when he talks to the photo guy, 17 min in, he says "i still have 43 min", which is again 60 in total. In the end, was it 60 or 45? :)
Well done you legend fantastic job
BeardMeatsFood Beats the meat 🥩👀
Nevermind sudocrem on your finger ,I think you'll need it somewhere else in the morning ,🤣
best youtube channel so farrr
Isn't the fat where all the flavors at 😂
Was just about to heat up a late lunch and wanted to think I was eating something much nicer. Thanks great Sir. A banging video as always. Cheers
Omg Adam. It’s a wonder you didn’t go pop. Well done honey. Hope Mrs Beard is well. Stay safe my lovelies xxx
Maybe start taking your own cutlery with yah  :P. Seems like you needed a good steak knife ;). Good job.
With steak... The fat is the meat and the meat is the veg.
Thank you for letting me eat vicariously through you. Keep up the good work 👍
Come to Germany!!!
well done steak. shit restaurant
if the timer starts when you cut in your steak could you not just eat all the sides first or most of them to get them out the way 🤔
lol for the last 100 videos ive wanted to ask, what is the catch phrase you mumble at the start?
Always my Thursday night treat. Epic Beard, That's on giant piece of meat.. It won't be Beard MEATS food without an epic challenge. Keep up the awesome work.. your videos keep getting better n better. 🤘 PS i bet your jaw was killing you at the end of this and blisters on your fingers. 😢
I can't believe you were in my home town and I missed you! Great effort beard!
'Sleep with a warming pan still in the bed' - classic!
You should bring an electric carving knife
I was laughing at the look on the babies face… baby meets beard! He certain that he wasn’t on the menu cause that Steak was bigger than him! Lol  Foliage on the platter, proceeds to dip said foliage in bbq sauce! 😂🤣😂🤣 Someone get this man some Salad Dressing!! Lol 😂
Normally i’d so a steak pun, but theyre rarely well done. 🥩🥩🥩🥩
Legend
The fact at the start of the video you told a baby it wasn’t getting eaten and you ate the weight of a viable baby in food is actually hysterical😭😭🤣🤣💀, insane steak though 🤯😎💪
Absolute animal beard.....
good job there not anal lol ,seen your eyebrow go up when he said he wasnt anal .
That's a Hutzpa showcase right there
That’s one plump steak
Still love you beard 👌
Great work beardie. I love how it was almost like you were having an argument with yourself over the timings 😂
Love a steak challenge. Always think of John Candy in The Great Outdoors. " He`s not done yet!" 😂😂😂😂
Killed it beard 💪🏼. Extremely random question. I have a beard similar in length, but yours always looks on point. How do you shape yours? Do you just constantly go to the barber? Or is Mrs. Beard a closet barber? Mine kinda just always looks like I'm a bum so I need your help 😅
Beard, when you getting your sister back into a challenge. Been a while.  Let's Go!
Super excited to see a challenge in Norfolk! 💕
Hey Beard if by any chance you ever end up in Malaysia hit me up and we'll find a food challenge for ya! Oh, and we'll make damn sure to jam some TBS!!! Love the vids! 🤘🤘
When a new vid from you turns up, my face smiles and I know I have something comforting to watch - and im only 15secs in
if you got a steak knife, would of been easier to cut
the texas chalenges do have lot less meat but they have like 5 pounds of spuds
Not even a steak knife to cut with? Would of made it easier on the cutting
Big mistake. They gave you 60min. Oh , 45min. Nevermind.
Bet his jaw hurts like hell! And that beef doesn’t look that tender.
My god. That much steak. How's your jaw feel?
you take the bed pan out b4 you go to bed you loon! 🤣🤣
Bro I am digging the shoes!!
Be careful in Swaffham, incest capital of the UK
Damn it...now I'm hungry!!
А прямо сейчас ...где то  в далёкой Африке... умерло 100 человек от голодной смерти ... Браво товарищ Будулай ! ...Приятного аппетита !...
Coming next Summer Beard Meets knitting needles 🪡 😎
They could’ve gave you a steak knife at least! 🤣
Cant believe that the mighty beard has been to Swaffham  im 10 mins down the road  I'd of  come for a gander
The fat on the meat is the best bit 😭😂
I would have rendered that fat down to baste the steak in for you and if the steak is that tough still, I’d have ran it through the meat slicer!! Lol 😂
Never realised  I was a Beardling, not sure how I feel about this!
I thought the chap at the start of the video said as a pair you get 45 minutes and solo you get 1 hour? you in the voice over say 30 mins for a pair and 45 solo, you also say this in the video description.
Gordan Ramsy would be well annoyed at that slice of cake, it was missing majority of the end of it lol
Huge meat 🥩
I ATE A BABY!!!!
Didn't they say 45 mins for a pair and 60 mins solo?
I saw an imposter without a beard, break one of your records today. What's going on beard!??
dude you're an animal! smashed it!
Beard never ceases to amaze me, I'm a about 4 stone heavier and I struggle eating a full 10 inch pizza. Machine
That was a Fred Flintstone steak right there! I think that was the biggest one I've seen you do. I found myself thinking: I donno about this one.... But like always you surprise me! And not one *napkin!* Another great video Beard!!
Brilliant. That wasn't a steak it was a roasting joint for a family of 4 with left overs lol x
Wow, legendary!  Your GI system must be over level 9000 to process that much beef!! Also those knitters are super adorable, I want to join them and learn.
👑
After reading the video title, I had 2 questions. What does a 100 oz steak actually look like and if its overcooked, Adam is fecked. After watching, I know what a 100 oz steak looks like and yes, it was severely overcooked! That was some world class eating Adam, bravo man, bravo.
@EricX I feel the same way.  Always makes me hungry for what Beard is eating.
I know your jaw is sore that show again love your channel 😊
No steak knife 😢
These videos so make me smile lol
I hope you're enjoying the meals too! :) Always good to see how much you can eat :D Also being genuinely nice is pretty rare. :) Keep it up!🤜🤛
Beard, you need a steak knife. Watching you saw through that steak with that butter knife hurt my arms. Smashed another one.
Does everything to get the tesla in 😂
Nice Lady "We'll teach you how to knit" Beard "Hold my chocolate cake, im in!"  GG you animal!
U R A CHAMPION MY BEARD
Dude's definitely not good at maths 😂 22mins
Well done! I would’ve enjoyed that fat though!
My nan taught me how to knit back iwhen I was a wee nipper it's a very relaxing hobby to have
Lol you had the perfect oppertunity to say.........i eat babies lol.....from Austin powers
Loved that they asked themselves if you were going to eat desert 😆
You mean.. steak of mind 😂😂😂
Lord please tell me you learned how to knit lol. That would be hilarious.
my jaw ached just looking at that steak lol
That is monstrous another great video, I wish I could say I can't believe your trying this on your own but when you remember your watching beard anything is possible on yours ones :)
they gave you a butter knife to cut 100oz of steak?
You rocked that Challenge!
Adam Adam Adam I always watch your video right before I order takeaway I always spend more after watching smash big meals like this haha
They must have just taken a cross section of a cow and slapped it on the grill
Nice video Mr Beard!! Is it me or was the knife to cut the steak really dull or was the steak really tough?
I was in Banff Alberta a couple days ago... Had to have some Alberta beef! Couldn't even finish an 18 oz tomahawk!! Go Beard go!
Legend...
There was a time I could eat half that steak(no sides) that time is long gone.
I remember a friend betting me 20$ I couldn’t finish this giant plate of Brussels Sprouts, was probably like 200 of them, but I did, and did it in about 4 minutes 😂😅
You should take an electric carving knife with you for the steak challenges. Less arm pump - lol
I have to ask… ever watched any @chubbyemu’s videos? How does your body handle so much of the sodium or sugar, etc.  ever ran into any emergency room scares?
The raised eyebrow moment when the chef said "we're not anal here" proper cracked me up 🤣
Good gosh, 100 oz steak = 6.25 lb of meat. Adding the side dishes and sauce, he was eating close to 10 lbs of food!
Was that knife even serrated 🤷🏼‍♂️😂
Come on two million subs….
Hahahaha legend!
Gotta admit, i'm happy for you that you didn't have to eat those large portions of steak's fat. No need to add "torture" tag to your video :P lmao
I’m 52 and a beardling 😂
Yes there’s a bedpan in the corner lol
you have such a nice beard!
Absolutely incredible!
Tight knit group your troupe of nan fans, Beard. Well done.
I knew you'd finish, but, I can't believe you finished THAT quickly.  (thats what she said)
Beard when are the philly videos coming out! I'm from philly so can't wait to see them
Unbelievable. Well done!
Rember to put water out for the birds 🐦🐦🐦 so hot 🔥 for them .
That looks like a butter knife
Holy F*ck Batman !!
They couldn’t give you a real steak knife?
I'm been craving a good rib eye for awhile. After watching this. I think tonight's the night . Grab me some veggies and Worcester sauce (my favorite) maybe some red wine as well. Cheers mate
what a BEAST!
“Who’s posh enough to buy their dog a rump steak?” had me rolling. Another awesome video Adam! Also, you, me and Joey from friends all share something in common. We don’t share food 🤣
I thought he said 45 for a pair and 60 solo?
NORFOLK'N CHANCE... HAD ME ROLLING.
Definitely got your protein in today.
Amazed as always well done
I dunno how you do this man 😂 You always eat the chips cold. Eating cold chips is worse than eating sawdust.
They could've knitted you a beard cozy :)
That was impressive
Adam you looked drugged in this one, must of been all that Steak.
Should make this a series , solo trying teamed challenges
Wow ,You're amazing.  Catch you on the next one!!. Regards from a Subscriber
I've been asking for a Swaffham Knitting Society collab for years. Thanks for finally getting around to it Beard. Top
That’s bigger than The Ol’ 96er!
he actually said an hour for solo and 45 if a duo
You had 60 mins and still killed it below 45 mins crazy
Your breakfast challenges I'm pretty sure I could accomplish ~ 75% of those, but these steak challenges are 3+ meals to me
Legit want to know if he learned how to knit
I think you misunderstood how long you actually get to complete the challenge, you were saying 30mins for a team and 45 mins solo, but at around the 3 minute mark the guy says he'll leave you alone for an hour.
Someone please tell me what he says at the beginning before hestarts the challenge oouts-ca-doo  its-trul-yeah I don't know it sounds different every time to me I have asked many times no one will help me. Edit oh my God that tray is buckling under the weight when they carried it out lol
Bossed it 😉
It's to warm the bed before you get in it ya lunatic.
There's something seriously wrong with you.🤣
absolute beast
good to see you actually used the sauce this time :P
why dont they give you a steak knife ? lol :D that normal knife aint gonna "cut" it :D no pun intended :D and why are there always mushrooms to everything ? haha :D aching jaws i imagine ? :D
In all fairness you should really get 60 minutes to finish Considering it’s a two man challenge so you should get 2x the time
If Elon musk built a robot called Adam this guy would be it man.....mate ur built different fuk sake animal
Well done Adam 👏
Just tried my first challenge yesterday. Failed but still enjoyed the food and taking the leftovers home. 😅 Managed to munch 1.4 of 2.3 kg Spaghetti, didn't expect to even eat half of it tbh. Great video as always Adam! 👍🏻Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪
When can we subscribe to Beard Meats Wool and watch you learn to knit?
This guy never loses.. I wonder if he only posts if he beats the challenge.
Sorry our Texas summer heat tagged along with you to the UK. PS, that was one adorable baby! You and Mrs. Beard should get one. 😜
I honestly love how you commentate your videos as well as star in them.  It just adds another dimension lol..  Keep up the good work dude!
Not doing well today on the commentary…3 completed it and it was 45 mins for a pair and 60 mins for solo. But well done beard, smashed it again!
Where did you get them shoes from , they're awesome
Did you stay for the knitting lesson?
They shoulda made you eat the fat.
That's nuts haha I love his awesome manners. He seems like a genuinely great guy, I'm definitely subscribing
out ofintrestgiven i he bd allergy thing for fungal things , do any exchange ... found a lot wont so cant do it without hospitalisation and anyphlaxya . be happy to change but cant do toms or fungus ... bugger .
I have a feeling Adam doesn't listen to people, first 45 mins for a team and 60min for solo.... and 3 teams have completed not 4, lol
Y didn’t they get you a better knife 🔪 lol
just subscribed and have been watching a bunch of your videos! What do you say at the start of the voice over? Ishtooah? i haven't a clue..
Great stuff as always. Again, a welcoming host really makes it. That seemed like a great venue.
Adam, at 9:07 the woman says something. Listen to it again, it sounds like she's saying "shall we make a bowl of snot, Fiona?"
could have brought the Mrs but she wouldn't have ate any of it. maybe 2 bites lol. no garlic bread.
You need some Joey Tribbiani maternity pants
the fat is the best part... looks like a prefect lunch to me, just before tea
Right on man, good job! I'm glad I found ya! 🥰👍🏼
Bit mean with the chips I thought , definitely not enough for two .
Got'em!~
Funny that thye gave you a butter knife to cut your steak with :-)
BeardmeatsKnit when?
You are fucking amazing 👏. 👍❤️👍
Awesome vid, Beardo you beauty... The people seemed very friendly and the knitting crew was a nice inclusion. How you could ask for dessert after chomping 100oz of beef and the extra sides, is beyond flexing!! Bring on the next one!
It's called a bed warmer. They used to move em around the bed to warm the sheets then take it out before you got in. Spooning hot metal would be rather risky...
Yikes! Rump steak = my jaw hurts just watching.
Dude just watching makes me go poop for at least 24 hours.  Nice  Job Mate
The customer and staff interactions greatly add to your videos!
They should of given you a steak knife or a sharper knife. Great job by the way!!!
Please make a beard napkin with your new found knitting skills. Absolutely brilliant vid 👍
Peace! From the USA!!!!
I see the Trump thumbs up 👍🏻 was on display again today. Good job mr beard 🧔🏻
That steak looked delicious.
Funny that he shortened the time he had remaining in his head and still would have beaten the challenge.
The only thing missing was a proper steak knife. A standard knife for a 100oz steak? For a lump of meat that size you need proper equipment.
they said  it start when he cut into the steak i would of ate everything else first lol
Du er grov!!!😹
I feel like you should invest in a razor sharp steak knife to have with you for these kinds of challenges
For a moment I got scared he wouldn’t ask for the desert menu … phew
11:54 WOAH Don't cut off before the knitting lesson!?
Wait the guy says solo you have 60 min, in pair 45. Afterwards you say solo has 45 min, pair 30 XD
BBQ on steak?? I’m sure it’s good… but A1 sauce…. Worchester sauce…
“We’ll teach you how to knit”. 😂 love ‘em!
Your a machine💪
Honest question; do you purge it all after you leave?? or just not eat for a couple days? Also... over 46k in views and only 2.9k "likes"!? geez people!
How did they give you a table knife for a 100oz steak?! You did so well despite that, great video as always beard!
We need a have you got a dessert compilation
Would be nice to see some fails 😂😂😂😂
Perhaps more of an aggressive steak knife might have helped! Nice job, Mr Beard
Hahah aww those little old dears were adorable 😂😂
its like the Old 96'er from The Great Outdoors (starring John Candy).
If you can take it with you, cut off the big wedges of fat and gristle and throw that in a pan by itself and fry it on a medium low heat for like an hour, flipping on occasion, to crisp up the outside and make the inside tender and delicious. No reason to throw those out.
You're a beast. Hahaha
That fat look nice in the side lol Is it like pork fat ie(crackling) or is it that nasty soggy stuff?
Beards a legend no challenge he can’t handle you done well there beard that steak was HUGE 💪👏👏👏
So just to confirm it’s 45 minutes for a pair to complete and 60 minutes to complete on your own?? Two different stories here… 🤣🤣
What the hell was that 1970s sitcom type music at the start?!  It was amazing!
Great vid. as usual. But they had to give you a steak knife you cut your meat easy with it, that they are made for to cut meat.
When I grow up I wanna have a beard as big as yours and eat as much as you.  I'm already 25 so idk how much longer I've got
Why do you guys use Km's and then go oz's?? PICK ONE!
THE FAT IS THE BEST PART LUBRICATE THE STEAK WITH THE FAT LOL
Liked getting a glimpse of th Doggo menu. I hope no dogs are on the menu, and Beard also draws the line on dogs as well as babies! Hope there are no Bishops around!
Beef is the most difficult food to digest ever. Any normal mortal would die of constipation.
If you were a real boss you'd have cut off the fat and had them put it under the grill and served it up at the end. You'd have had enough time left at the end to still do it.  😋😂
Curious what the 2mil Sub special is going to be
Your the best. Thank you for always giving us some fun entertainment.
That’s great love you’re content buddy.
Your pun game is top tier. Well done!
After the end credits... Where Beard has the final ten second clip before the video ends... I thought he would fade back into shot with him sat in the pub knitting his own scarf... Mumbling knit one purl one... 😂
Ahh my neck of the woods ☺️
I'm not usually all that impressed anymore with how many times you surprised me, but this one really brought back that surprise for me. Good job mate!
What a nice man that was
You'll be eating that fat for yer brekfast,  young man !
That bowel movement is gonna be killer
I still like your videos even though you wear skinny jeans...lol!
That is a dang Chuck Roast! That ain't no steak!
You staying locally in Norfolk
You poor guy they gave you a butter knife to cut that roast with!!  Next time pack a steak knife or a few band-aids for your cutting finger!  Love your humor!
A better knife would have been helpful 😂😂
Wow Who Would Ever Of Thought  Beard Meats Food Saying  That The Mushrooms  🍄 🍄 🍄 🍄 Made A Pleasant Change From The Steak 🥩 I Never Saw That On Coming
That looked like a full cow and what a job well done Adam your a beast son!!! 🔥🤘🏻👍🏻
Great collab Adam 😂 Congrats on almost 2 million subscribers! Let's get it! Awesome video!
Beard eats chocolate cake like he’s trying to preserve a perfect application of his most expensive lipstick.
OMG love me some steak but no worried the Beard got this one Handle LOL hope Mrs. Beard is doing well love you guys ❤️
You are a beast man. I would go for that but in 24hrs 😁
kudos knitting krew 😍
That couldn't have been a good piece of meat to eat. A rump is not a cut of meat that should be prepared like that. That is a low and slow cooking method cut of meat.
ya better get that dessert🤣
Hello from Serbia. I watchyou  allways and every day You suprise. Me with time and effort to eat. You are the best! Much support to You!
Why did they give a butter knife for a steak?
Quick meal after the gym, huh?
So glad you have managed to get to Norfolk! 😁
I can't get over the fact that they give him a butter knife to cut this with.
Love it! You had those ladies when you talked about knitting. :D Also, yes, that was a bedwarmer. They would put coals in it. Some people couldn't afford them, they used warm bricks wrapped in a cloth.
I💕this…and not anything on or in beard
Giant meat challenges are the main ones I could imagine myself managing to do. Don't know why so many people fail those types.
Excellent work and what a friendly place
WHAAAAAAT? DESERT TOO? 👏😄
Way to Go, Beard!!   When I saw the size of that steak,  for the first time, I was not optimistic,  but once again, you won the challenge!!
I can’t even finish a X-Large kebab 🤣
I ate a 50oz wagyu ribeye challenge recently at a local food fest, it was my biggest steak to date by 2oz. Was basically a 3 rib roast, and was so tender I barely even had to chew. It was DELICIOUS, cooked perfectly and so juicy I barely even needed water, plus the monster baked potato that came with it had enough butter and sour cream to float a barge. Absolutely my favorite food challenge to date. It wasn't free, but it was half price for finishing in less than an hour (I had the 2nd best time at 33 minutes) and I got a cap and "Carnivore" bib.
You'd think that rocket would be what we call arugula in the states and not the other way around 🤷‍♂️
Adam, you should go back and watch your video again. If there's 2 people, it's 45 mins. 1 person gets an hour.
I couldn't eat 100oz of AIR. Holy garbage disposal. I need a Pepto after watching
Oooh a very rare uncorrected narrating error Adam😮 it's 45 & 60 minutes instead of 30 & 45😎  Awesome video as usual tho, i know how you do it but still, you could starve me for a week and i wouldn't finish that😂
WELL DONE!
You're a savage...lol.
In Texas we would never serve you a rump ROAST and kall it a “steak”
Mate I love your channel. I've binged it all in the last 3 weeks since I've found it. I now can't wait for Sundays and Thursdays. Have a good weekend pal 👍🏻
Damn now im hungry for stake now
Does that massive kind of meat destroy your guts? Need a lot of water maybe?
Great job beard but with all of that fat I don't know about 100% cow?  lol  I would say that if you take that fat away it's not too much more then the 85 oz. steak in Texas???  Again great job on eating all that good looking food!!!
100oz? Wow, is this the largest steak challenge in the world?
I thought the beard was a bib
Could've given you a sharp knife, that was a workout and a half
could you please reattempt that cheese cake you failed awhile  back its still the only thing i've ever seen you lose too.
Mate, if you want those lovely ladies to knit you a beard all they need to is bring their knitting needles, to make you the first-ever combination knitted beard bib...!   😂
That looked like an awesome steak. Biggest I ever managed was a 40oz at the Dog and Partridge Pub in Tean near Stafford. Be fun for you to go there and attempt two of their steak challenges at the same time.
omg that looks amazing.
This channel is great! Keep doing what your doing my friend.
You need the Wahl James Martin Cordless Knife For Meat Like That
Beard is salt of the earth kinda dude, very decent human.
The hot tomatoes turn my stomach.
Hand and jaw pain is the only hard part about this but tbh this seems very easy for him. i could possibly do that.
Hilarious how the rules on the commentary totally contradict the rules the bloke said at the start. Mr beard was it beef freeze not brain freeze lol
Maybe its the fat american in me, but I love some nicely rendered steak fat. I woulda diced that up abit and mixed it in with smaller cuts of streak to spread it out.  Great Job Beard!  Have you ever tried a blue cheese sauce on steak? Very rich but one of my favorite steak toppings.
The knife did not look like a steak knife, was it?
Would have been nice to have a proper steak knife instead of that glorified butter knife you were using.
You should take a sharp knife to do steak challenges, won't help your jaw but light work slicing!
Awesome work! Good luck passing that thought 🥴
100 oz = 2,83 kg = 6,2 pounds plus the side dishes this is about 3,7 kg = 8,1 pounds of food.  What a beast ehm  Beard! :D
I watch this and think its as good as watching WSM, a 100m sprint and these insane feats of human performance.
Watching Beard take his time and enjoy a well earned dessert after a monstrous food session is just pure bliss. <3
Can't wait to watch your new knitting channel!
now THAT was amazing........................
Could you bring kitchen scissors to help cut up the meat? Or is that at least in spirit against the rules
The fat is the best part!
Just checked it and another video came, let's go 🔥
Hold you ard... We calls it ... Swaaaafum...
Impressive!  Wish you ate the gristle so you could join the iconic club of Chester "Chet" Ripley from the movie "The Great Outdoors"
No steak knife ?
Did you call us beardlings.....wow and ya it's a bad warmer and a spittoon not two things I would want to see when eating
Love your videos you got this
Beardlings!
Adam you are AMAZING! ❤🇬🇧😎
I see you where at my local in spennymoor 👍 upload waiting 😎
The smallest sides ever what is that.
32 minutes until the first napkin! Beard record?
While watching this I was eating a curry with a side of Bombay potatoes and naan I couldn’t even finish that mate you ain’t human
I’ve been on a strict diet & getting slimmer. Watching beard eating videos is the best I got rn 😅😂
Should be an hour if solo
Great video like always man!
2 forced full adverts is taking the piss m8
But Beard! The fat is where the flavor is...
Now I'm all hungry for steak! If I had that big bad boy, I'd be eating on it for five days or more!
I'm surprised they didn't give you a proper steak knife.
Hey Beard, love your stuff.. can you explain what you use the diet coke for?
wow 100 oz go beard go…oh snap !…i forgot the sides😋
I love how you reckoned the greens will help move things along in the morning, you’ve eaten enough meat  to fill a septic tank!
A steak challange and they give you a butter knife to cut it with?? Haha thats a stitch up!
The world is not enough for this man.
Holy man...u the beard all rights omg ur the best n my fav of all time
Classic thumbs up pic doesn’t get old , keep up the awesome videos mate
@BeardMeatsFood, @1:15 he said if you're on your own then you have 60 mins, if you are two of you you have 45 mins. @4:04 You mention as a pair you get 30 mins to finish, but if you have the hutzpah to do this solo it's 45. Did you notice that? Just wondering? you are a monster eater..... thanks for the great content!
The restaurant kept saying 1hour, but you kept saying 45 minutes. Did you get the rules changed? Hahaha
OMG you Hethen.... Bbq sauce on a steak?!?!?!?!?! Shame on you. You will pay for that at the pearly gates my man
I'm surprised you were able to chew the cake! Your jaws must have hurt.
didnt they give you a proper steak knife?  got to say that steak looks good but how many oz's was that fat?
Thought it was 45 mins for two and 60 mins Solo ! anyway mighty meaty challenge . Nice.  Maybe the ladies could help you knit your beard ! lol
Knitting would be fun to see you do! It's one of those underappreciated arts, especially in modern times.
Its me birthday today and my wife is taking me to a seafood buffet. I have been waiting for your video to come out so I can get really hangry before we go so I can eat so much more than I usually can! Thanks mate!!
Imagine if the warming -pan had a baby in it!Come on,Adam,keep up!
Spend more times cutting the meat than eating
Man, just watching you chow down on this steak is making my jaw hurt  Nice job dude
That is just impressive. I did a 40oz steak challenge and struggled. This is just amazing and I loveeeee when you order dessert after lol.
Besides using sauce to help change and make it different why not eat some of the sides in-between so many bites?
Beardlings 😂 Love it 👊
Adam pulled at the Knit and Natter..  😂
Nice! And you kept the glorious beard clean! Too bad you don't have room for those good looking sides. Wow! I spoke too soon! I'm blown away! Nothing wasted!
36k views in 24 minutes? A lot of us really have nothing to do on a hot July day LOL. I could understand it if it were early morning or late night, but it’s not lol. Looks delicious though
They a breakfast challenge in Margate in Kent I saw someone try to do it but he left around about half of it The 'Mega Breakfast' is a challenge that sees customers take on the biggest breakfast in Kent with the aim of finishing the lot within 20 minutes. The rule is, if you can clean your plate within that time, you get your meal for free.The Dalby Cafe 4-6 Dalby Rd, Cliftonville, Margate CT9 2EX
why is there not a dessert menu t shirt?
When I grow up, I want to be part of the Swaffham knitting association.
That poor baby looked so concerned hahaha
They make stakes out of dog rump?!?! Jkjk
I have one
He could’ve completed it quickly if they gave him a steak knife not a butter knife
How would you have explained to ancient people that in the future people can eat and get paid
Beard! On this huge meat platters you really should bring a kitchen knife to cut it!! Or ask the kitchen to send one out! Save your hands and arms!! LOL
Hey beard what would you prefer in a challenge? Your meal for free or a free t-shirt you can only pick 1! Love the vids 🙂
That was awesome!!!!  Way to go! Great job!
Algorithm
So then beardy,you’ve had your starter what you having for your main?
Yay, Norfolk 'n' good, welcome Beard
A very decent portion of chips for a change. Mushrooms though.. 😂🍄🍄 Also.. Almost 2 million subs!!! Anything big planned?? Cmon tell us.. Ya will. You will you will you will you will. You must 😘😘
Animal. I like it.
away from the challenges do you eat huge meals or just normal
The most impressing thing aabout this is that you ate all that in well done, literal rubber and dry
The boss man in the background should be brought in full time to announce your arrival whenever you enter anywhere. He has charisma in that voice of his.
that's nuts, yo
Whats the hardest part of eating challenges? beeing in the middle or when you have those leftovers and you have to force yourself?
Amazing job.
Well you know what they say Adam sharing is caring lol by the way I love your version of the game it's funny as hell also what cut of the cow is the steak
No steak knife 🤯🤯🤯🤯
👍👍👍👍
Beef 🥩 army! 😂😂😂
You saying "don't mind me I'm just being a professional pig" made me burst out laughing 😂😂
You should make a only fans we can sub to that you only post your turds on after eps like this
No, you don't sleep with the bedwarmer. It's used to warm the bed before the sleeper gets in the bed. Cold sheets in the winter take a while to warm up from body heat alone.
All I can say is I would love to be your plumber business would be good 👍
Beardlings 🤣. I love it.
I always hit that like button. Before I watch. Always good vibes. Smashed it as always. That steak looked good. Nice collab. Lol. Always love the banter. :D Have a great weekend. You and Mrs. Beard.
How the actual fuck did he manage that :D
That looks so good! Back in the day I would have tried something like that. But now I have too many medical issues that would prevent me from even thinking about that
Another brilliant upload from Beard
I wouldn't call that a steak, I'd call it a pot roast.
Beardlings!!
BEAST MODE 👌
The challenge itself is absurd, but I don't know how the fuck this legend let's the food digest for a bit then eats desert.
That is SO impressive!!
Wow that was some eat Adam, but you smashed it , proud of you , top job
Coming soon: Adam's second channel "Beard knits food"
Never thought i would would suggest this on your channel mate, but have you considered the arm pump surgery pro motorbike racers get to help with cutting through large pieces of steak lol?!?!?! :D
It might be more fun with two. You should try it.
I so wanna see the colab..... beard knits a sweater...
Unbelievable. This guy needs a star on Hollywood’s walk of fame.
That was unreal 😮
Respect !
How don't they have a real steak knife with a handle?
No way you’re in Norfolk mate I’m just down the road haha swaffhams a nice little town
Someone find a mushroom eating challenge! It’s the only way the beard can be stopped!
Its definitely a victorian bed warmer. Great effort Beard 👏👏👏
Beard, I'm a big fan of your videos, and was delighted to see you come into my neck of the woods to do a food challenge! If I'd have known you was gonna be visiting, I'd have come down to see you take on the challenge!
I’m so gutted I never knew you were down in Norfolk, would have loved to have met you.
That looks like a butter knife and not a steak knife👀👀
He came. He saw. He CONQUERED!!  Once again the BEARD HAS DONE IT!!
Stool softener
I live right near swaffham!
Cheers Mr.Beard 👍😎👍
Dips his rocket in bbq sauce. This is a new low Adam
OMG... A lot of meat... Best for ya Bro...
Wtf but nearly got him that steak
Top effort Mr Beard
We'll teach you a bit. Those ladies are fantastic
That eyebrow raise... 😂😂 Top work my man. Much love.
Bro I think your wife doest have cooked for you once in a life  As you after completing  one challenge surely not be able eat for next 6 days 😂😂😂
7:40 That thing in the background looks like a fireplace popper .... for making popcorn before popcorn makers! I might be wrong too.... But that's my guess and I'm sticking by it!!
Love the knitting ladies
Damn, that was amazing. Great work man!
This was a good challenge
Heatwave in the UK RN, massive meat challenge, and STILL you wear sweatshirts. I just don't get it bro. Why not wear a tee for once? You own like a thousand of 'em...  ;)
Congratulations! 🥳 Everything looked DELICIOUS! 😋  Safe Journey!  CHOLULA!!!
Well...I would make a joke about lubricant. Never ceases to amaze me where you put it all!! Hollow legs by any chance?? 😂😉
Awesome you even beat it within the  45 mins team time.
Wow that was impressive ma dear, phew you blew the staff and customers away. Get in!  Have a great weekend 😀
"We're going to need plenty of lubricant to get this down." That's what she said.
Omg! It’s so weird seeing you so close to where I live! I hope you enjoyed your time in Norfolk! 😊😊
you are just too so great 👍
Spending more time cutting than chewing   wow lmao
7690 calories for that 100oz steak, not counting the sides. Well done man.
think you might need to start bringing your own cutlery, need a sharper knife for a steak that size.
Again 👍a nice video... enjoyable
Beard almost at 2M subscribers, you deserve all the love and praise, such a top bloke!
Could of at least give you a proper steak knife no wonder your hands where hurting. Great job though dig the vids!
Swaffham 🤣 what a shithole I live 20mins away from there lol
I think it’s time for the tube of terror 2.0 👍
Thinking to myself as soon as the video started.. beard why have you worn a jumper again 😅😅 was shouting for you to put the knife and fork down.. made that look very easy! Well done
360oz is the current record at Wards House of Prime...:)
Mental job lad
Fat is the best bit.
I almost thought that said "White Harts 1000Zer" instead of "White Harts 100 Ozer" and was wondering how that is meant for 2. 100oz makes much more sense than 1000oz.
watching this gave me the meat sweats
Happy Eating Beard!
They could have given you a better knife. You spent half your time trying to saw through the steak!
I love how humble he is. Every single time. 🔥
But that big strip of Fat looks so crispy...
Don't forget to like😊
you left the good part Adam...The Fat is Yummy
Looks well done and half grizzled..   Hard to swallow but not much to eat you got this. Very small sides.   No doubts on beard the rump roast smasher. Hahahahaha  And a butter knjve to cut with a hahahah
Did they teach you how to knit then?!
Well done fella
good evening bro
Cream, whipped cream, ice cream or custard?
Bro your a legend
2:03 Toddlers on the other hand... xD
Ahh man I live in Thetford Norfolk. Wish I’d have known you were in Norfolk. Would have loved to meet you.
I just found your channel, you have another fan in the states! I don't usually enjoy food challenge videos, but your commentary is fun and not just gross like others...
Impressive jaw strength  ... great video
That is a massive chunk of meat! 100 ounces is a lotta beef!
The Swatham Ladies Knitting Association.. lordy lordy.. How do you think this stuff up? Ha ha 😂
How come u dont wear a t shirt in the summer? And wear jumper in winter? 🙏
It is my opinion, no one should ever share a steak.
👍🏼👊🏼🦖🍺
Do a video with paddy the baddy 🤞🏼
Beard - Your music for this video sounds like some cheeky 70s UK comedy - very reminiscente of the confessions series or on the buses!!!
That’s not a steak it’s a roast you can do this Adam. Love your videos you are awesome 🍽👌👏⭐️👍❤️😋
Aww the ladies at the end saying they’d teach you to knit 🥹 so cute!
I don’t think you will ever fail
What's up BEEF army lol
Omfg i love your videos but this is crazy. Love you man, thanks for entertaining me.
Commentary was a bit off today 😅 but awesome video as always 😊
Your a beast dude
That was a lot of meat for sure ! Those ladies were super nice hahaha. Everybody was nice ! The dreaded fungus are always here 😂
60 mins solo, do you not listen, Senior Beard🤔🤣
this guy dunked the salad in bbq sauce 😂😂
Can’t wait for the first Beard Meets Knitting challenge.
That really is an obscene amount of food that only a small portion of ppl around the world could finish but the dessert flex at the end is pure criminal
Beardlings.... Yes
What the fuck is that knife
You are crazy man. Great video. I have been enjoying your challenges you do.
Just impressed. I always think: nah he isn't going to finish but then the beard puts me in my place.
Outstanding Adam! Loved it as always. Beast mode for sure…
I'm ashamed to say it, but I do love the fat.  :)
Half of the challenge here is cutting and chewing. Be nice if they cut it for you to save the shoulder work.
Cutting steak with a butter knife is rough!!! Need a cleaver for that one!
Never been into sharing.  Spoken like a true trencherman!
You got the times wrong in your voice-over... the actual times were 45 for two eaters and an hour for one, not 30 and 45.
All the cows out there best watch out when beards about just like the Jeremy Beadle theme tune 🤣
Good thing I ate before watching this time.
shittiest. steak. knife. ever.
Damn, are you an alien? Maybe a lion could throw back 5 1/2 pounds of meat in 30+  minutes, but I didn't think a human could. LOL, just kidding, great content as always
Your memory for pub names, the challenge names and the time limits is as hilarious as your eating skills are impressive 🤣
Why do I love these videos so much!
Nice to see you in Norfolk.
Great vid as always BUT how fare u cut the fat off !!! The flavour your losing ..... that's just sacrilege... Best bit of the steak ....
My dude looks beef drunk
Wow wow wow unreal
That steak looked unreal 😍
The only channel I can watch when I’m full, to then make me instantly hungry again! Love your videos beard 👋
Adam rippin that meat to bits, you needed a bloody chainsaw tho this was a work out it seems
Well done see you on the next one 👊
I've got to ask how is your stomach after these meals
That looks tougher than a leather handbag.
4:04 got it slightly wrong there beard 😂
Wow, just wow.
That steak doesn't look appealing
You need to learn to eat a steak of that size with your hands and not fork and knife.
256 views w/154 likes is unacceptable. This is epic - LIKE THE VIDEO!
how you (or people doin steak challenges in general) resist the urge to grab that thing with bare hands and just bite and tear out meat like a caveman?
Arrive on time! come on adam
I use to date a dude from Texas and not everything in Texas bigger 💁🏼‍♀️🤣🤣
Look forward to seeing your videos Thursday and Sunday. I'm here from New Mexico USA. You got this beard
Water fasting for a few days, Beard’s challenges seem to fill me up 🥹 🐄 😋
You are the best
I want to see you stomach before and after one of these meals
Beardlings! 😂
Wow
It's a bed pan
Employees from that restaurant are sooooooo nice
1st
Yessss first time watching so early nice!
🤣 too many funny things said in this but I definitely think they should rename that challenge to what you said. And wow that's a lot of steak. Keep it up Adam! You the man! Keep that beard clean! Lol 🤣🤙🤣
Could’ve got sister beard in for this one! I remember her doing pretty well in a steak challenge before!
Beardlings😂
Reminds me the episode of the Simpsons. Btw first time you use a fork, congrats man
That’s incredible.
How much was it?
Just curious, do you ever think to yourself, how much of my life is spent traveling from one food joint to the next, just to have the thrill of beating some record.   Do you remember what food tastes like when you took the time to enjoy each bite without a stopwatch?   In the grand scheme of things, what record are you setting, today, that will not be forgotten in years to come?  Is it that important, or are you afraid of starving?
Old Adam getting free knitting lessons!
Good afternoon Beard! Thanks for the new post!
Great job
This was barnstorming 😀, cheers Adam
How about a challenge where Mr.Beard has to eat a pound of spicy Mushrooms?😂 No seriously: Nothing can stop this Man💪🏻
and here's me feeling like a badass for upgrading my beefeater mixed grill to an 8 OZ steak instead of a 4 OZ and finishing it lol
Im guessing the editing and description is wrong? Guy said 60 mins solo and 45 mins as a team?
Beard is the first maniac riding solo to attempt this sadistic challenge 😂
Beardlings! Hahaha!
YESSS
Mr beard never gets into a beef, he eats it
Alright boys I did the math for my fellow 'Mericans, in freedom units 100 oz is 6.25 lbs. Jesus Giggling Baby Christ, you are a beast Beard.
Doggo Menu. So they do Korean food too?
I think I would take that including the fatty parts.
You are bum beard man but got to love ur eating abilities keep it coming bum
A pot of chips... Why!?!
Just found your channel and have been binge watching these videos!! Absolutely love them, love doing challenges myself, looking for some more local ones to tackle haha
did anyone else want to try some of that fat ?
Is that a half of a cow
He said "when you cut into your steak"... I'm sensing some side eating before steak cutting could be done?!
What was more worn out, your jaw or your cutting hand?
This thing doesn't look soft at all
Swaffham! I have family there  Blimey well done beard that was a massive steak 👀 smashed it tho 👌 👏
3.5k in 4 minutes……….shiiiiiiiiiit son!!
always good to see you eat m8 ... and the jokes ... well .. errr ok :P
Just perfect timing eating myself and the Bell informed for ur new video 🤟🏽💯
The 'Doggo Menu' may lead to some confusion... is it dog meat or meat for the dog?
perfect timing
What's with the mushrooms?
come nd try some indian challanges bruh 😆
Not going to shite for a week after that
The catchphrase always sounded like a shoutout to classic punk band Hüsker Dü.
“Never really been into sharing tho” thats my life motto
Ho. Lee. Sheeeyite. That's a big steak.   Props to you my dude.
That is really a ton of food, would probably choke to death if I ate as fast as this dude 😂
Beardlings 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Uploaded 2 mins ago?? For change I'm on time!! Let's go Adam
Politely requesting a big cheat day vid over here 👋🏻
I read that as 1000zer lol
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
