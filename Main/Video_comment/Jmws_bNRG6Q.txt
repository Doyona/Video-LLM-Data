*WATCH THE ANNOUNCEMENT VIDEO HERE* ▸ https://youtu.be/DwsZggwPRKc
And so comes the reunion of Smosh! PressAlike collaborate to work together with Smosh!
im pretty sure a new if movies were real got made in 2025 lol, its def not number 10 but i just realized that while rewatching this video
have those 4 scripts you wrote come out yet?
wdym... smosh the movie was a great film
Omg thank you Rhett and Link❤
After defy, smosh became a mythical channel. I never got into old smosh when I was a kid, but mythical smosh is fantastic, I love all of the people like best friends
its 2025. Im 34. Grew up with very early smosh. This video made me happy you two spoke to each other and got back together.
people don't understand burnout, which is a real and intense thing. i can't even imagine all of the stress and emotions anthony had to go through during the fuked up defy times and i applaud him for being able to take control and get himself to be the best person he can be.
Anthony is kind of like Sasuke in a way. He be looking kinda emo even to this day, he left his team of silly people, did darker stuff for a while, then later SPOILER ALERT  came back to the silly people at home.
These guys were literally the talk of my primary smosh this Ian that Charlie the drunk hamster 2009-2013
The Pokémon rematch was one of the first videos I ever remember watching. I’m only here because of Smosh and a lot of people feel that way. You guys really made something happen that did not exist. That’s really amazing and I’m so happy to have seen it happen. Sending my love always.
45:55 The start of the intro.
This made me think about my highschool/college  best friend that I haven't connected with in a long time .  Let's connect with our past best friends
I enjoyed the movie, also because I was 12 years old when I watched it
the get well card made me genuinely cry and say aww out loud omfg
Just a PS autoimmune disease could be exacerbated by surface piercings like the face one :(
This feels like watching two divorced parents work out why they got married in the first place
God how I wish I still had my copy of Smosh Magazine that I got at a Pueblo CO gas station in 2014
This is such a romance. Young Ian putting on a brave face while ant is needing like the adventurous drive forward but he's the one who brings that to the duo. The balance of practicality and responsibility with passion and drive is what made smosh from jump. The fact that losing ant was the breaking point for Ian's heart when his approach was trying to b supportive by being strong thru it... ow. It all worked out tho. Thx for the laughs boys.
I'm 57 minutes into the video and am now realising that every time they try to articulate what it is they rediscovered during the reconciliation lunch/writing session, they tended to ramble a lot about magic and creativity etc when really they'd just had a "oh I still love you" epiphany in that moment. I don't think they were doing it deliberately it just got me in my feels just now
I can’t thank both of you guys enough for holding me up during some of my darkest moments, I love you guys
Elvetica moments
not the milk fic, goatse and blue waffle references at the end😂😂
Anthony and ian
I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING 😭💙
Would you come as you are, or as you were?
Oh for God's sake, Ian, at 1:01:11 and 1:01:58, can't you just say "faithful to the people that LOVE US"??!! Jeez...
Once again, these videos are so valuable in that we get to see the Smosh cast being real. We see them being goofy and hilarious so often that we (or at any rate I) can sometimes forget that these are actual people with actual lives and actual feelings. Not everything is a joke, and I appreciate times like these when we can see that Ian, Anthony, Courtney, Shayne, and the rest of them take things seriously when it’s time to do that.
1k likes where hit or not? Ian had a huge problem with this word at that time. It's unbearable to watch this because of it and I just got into SMOSH lore now and trying to understand what happened but his overuse of "like" it's horrible. I did notice that since last year he is not over using this word, which is appreciated.
42:00 Ian is so me. " I still won't" yeah I feel them I'm not gonna tell u about it 😂
i expected a lot more frolicking for some reason
Total fan of Ian!!!❤
This made me emotional 🥹
These two are the first people me and my brother watched on YouTube and subscribed to way back in 2011!
anthony is so hot
These guys are kinda funny, maybe they should think about doing skits together
I appreciate Anthony's emotional vulnerability. And I'm so glad he's healed.
What they're describing here really feels like what I remember reading about the relationship between McCartney and Lennon, especially their creative relationship and different perspectives of the business aspect. Like, not even trying to be disrespectful or anything, not even kidding. Just. Really puts me in mind of that. The again, I feel like everything I've read about Lennon/McCartney is from the outside perspectives of the people around them. Still.
You should have the OG smosh games, mari, sohinki, joven, and lasercorn
Anthony crying has me crying 😢
And where is Anthony now, i don't see him in smosh ever ?
Also I always felt like Anthony abandoned Ian when he first left, also whatever happened to smosh games crew ???? Sohinki Jovenshire and Lasercorn
11:20  11:35 DAWG IM SO GLAD THEY BROUGHT UO THAR VLOG ERA ANTHONY HAD 😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 i would watch that RELIGIOUSLY, after school.  Lunchtime with Smosh, Mailtime with Smosh, Finding Twitter Questions, and Anthony's vlogs. Damn i dont even remember her nsme 😭 😂😂😂 but I remember they had cats, Leppard spots. Damn im gonna have to look it up
the more i get older the more i realise the death of defy 100% could've easily killed smosh entirely. none of the people that were there at the moment it shut down (apart from Ian) had zero obligation to stay and chose to keep it alive. pretty cool
Ian such a charming ❤❤❤❤❤
These two are and always have been to me the Drake and Josh of YouTube😂
I need Ian to drop his skincare routine, the mans is GLOWIN
"My childhood friend is still here" "if we burn it to the ground im happy to do that with you" these might be the most romantic and genuine statements i have heard on this app, even fanfic writers cant come up with this
Anthony trying to hug Ian and say "thank you", and then Ian does a butt dance
How dare you hang up on cold ones and the gang, lmfao just kidding I wouldn’t have answered either but still sad lmao
And then they stopped making sketches and the main chanel becaume bit city
9:07 being in my 20s now listening to this knowing I was one of those children watching 😭😂
From everybodys heart and childhood, thank you both.
you guys got me started learning english
Anthony crying 😭
Ian is so depressed here
42:12 omgggggg they are kinda...
Crying ❤
You probably have no idea who Jackson Wang is but he would be perfect as a guest. He is a kpop idol and is not shy at all when it comes to his mental health. You will find he does most of the talking.  He's very deep so please check him out.
30:09 so tommy was the one who pissed the table, right? lol i keep rewatching this video i still can't believe it happened
🍄❤️🍄  Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy
This is what NWA tried to do after Jerry was out the picture but eazy got Aids n people thought he had gay wiener
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Almost 20 years of SMOSH. We're getting old 😭😭😭
You know they’re back because otherwise two grown men wouldn’t be hugging while squatting and spinning in a circle together 😂😂
56:37 lol not Anthony dropping ROFL
I've never seen you guys' feet move so much before lol got me good with that music in the end though fersherr 😭
i'm pretty sure Smosh the Movie was one of the first things i ever spent my own money on online
...there are two milk fics?
A core memory for me is the Zelda rap and the behind the scenes
Find yourself someone who looks at you the way Anthony looks at Ian.
i loved smosh the movie omg😭😭 re watched it 10000 times and i was indeed a child
I spent a day with indIan Threcox
I adore Ian and Anthony’s friendship so much, I am genuinely SO happy that they reunited. Smosh has been one of my favourite channels for years and this is the happy ending we all dreamed about!!! 🥰💜 Massive respect to Ian and Anthony for being so vulnerable, honest, and empathetic in this video, and to Rhett and Link for protecting Smosh and making sure this exciting future was possible.
I got introduced to Anthony as a person with this channel, not realising he was one of the duo from smosh. I'm so glad he found his voice here as I love the interviews they're unique and interesting.
1 year later they look so much more like twinks here than in actuality
42:04 - That was so heartwarming man. ❤❤❤
Y’know, I know I’m super late about this but….  Round of applause to Ian for being so strong and resilient, if it wasn’t for him, I don’t think Smosh really had a chance. Hell, I never even knew about Smosh until the pandemic.  But seeing Ian through watching old and new Smosh videos, I’m really glad he was able to hold out this long to finally get Smosh back with Anthony.   To see him go back to being *himself* after years and years of dealing with a soon-to-be-dead livelihood it really warms my heart.
Im really happy for these two, i hope it works out, Smosh was the first channel that i started watching and I’ve been on youtube ever since, like they said they were the first to do so many things, and paved the way for many more to come
WHAT THE HELL IT'S BEEN A YEAR ALREADY!!!
Why does he cox? Is he gay?
1 year ago, wow.
God does love Ian hexcox
I think your humor is a generational and yes it’s not educational but it is very good and I’m 25 😂
I think I get Bit City. Improvised Talk Show with scripted Sketches. A+++. (EDIT) from the "company" smosh. It literally let's everyone shine in their strengths. Let's bring back credits though for crew. We know cast but if anyone works on the video I think there name should be on screen at some point. Hell do it "Whoes Line" style and have the cast read the crews names on a tela prompter.
37:08 who’s Diana ?
19:23 you could see it still hurts 😢🥺
It doesn’t really seem like Smosh has changed at all since Anthony came back
1:12 so grateful for the explanation bc I'm brand-spanking new here
anthony tattoo is made by 6 year old
I will never get over "cyberspace celebrity"
I remember watching Smosh after school. Then one day I was like, what are they up too I haven't seen them post in a while. Look and it was SO different. I had to catch on the gossip. I remember unsubscribing. Now re-subed and ready for the new adventure. So glad two bro's reconnected <3
And they wonder why people ship them
Adult friendships do require an independent journey sometimes, especially if you hold onto parts of yourself that are outdated and too associated around a person. I relate heavily to that. It's beautiful to see that the purity of that connection at its core can bring people back together and allow for that personal growth to be authentic.
They didn’t even mention Smosh babies
Two best friends in a room, they might kiss!
every time i watch an anthony padilla video i think about smosh
Insane that they brought up The Milk Fix
they literally worked it out on the remix
Ian is the content creator version of the "dad who stepped up".
as someone who discovered smosh at like 11 that shit slapped
I found Smosh only recently, like May 2023 because I saw a Reddit stories clip reposted to fb because I'm old and that's where I hang out. It is now a part of my daily life. You two built something very special, and since the reacquisition my enjoyment has gone nowhere but up. I'm so proud of what you've been through and what you've done.
Los amo chicos  I love you guys
It's weird how Anthony was gone long enough for new Smosh to have a solid identity without him, and pretty quickly reintegrated to be a part of new new Smosh
God bless and loves y’all Amen 🙏🏽✝️🙏🏽❤️🤭
This was the start of the Smosh renaissance
22:16 anyone know what song they’re talking about
There are meetings that could’ve been emails.  Then there are emails that should’ve been meetings.
Can’t believe it took me forever to watch this but I love both of em so much
If there ever comes a day when these 2 confesses that they actually hated each other but just worked really well together like Adam and Jamie. I'm just gonna fucking kms
My childhood 🥹
I will say, I love the smosh movie I still watch it
Anyone else realize Ian looks EXACTLY like Charlie Day?
Stop seeking and you will find it
Ian is such an istp and anthony is such an enfj
honestly i found anthony before i found smosh lol i was so surprised when someone in an interview revealed that it was him
I have watched this 3 times now. My brain is reeling. I still cannot believe it.
There's two things I wanna say, "Fuck DEFY"...
This is the longest science project ever
I have never seen a single Smosh sketch, but I am emotionally invested in Anthony and Ian’s story.
My dead childhood has healed a little seeing this
I very much relate to Ian, i feel things but when i talk about those feelings I'm very monotone and distant sounding, i think its discomfort and years of distancing yourself from your emotions in order to get by. And some of that is literally his sense of humor.
Name a duo more iconic than this, I'll wait
To be perfectly blunt, Ian saved SMOSH. I have been watching since the BEGINNING, ebbed and flowed, and then stopped the second Anthony left. But I would still occasionally swipe past a Smosh video on Facebook or something and I would ALWAYS look for Ian. If Ian had left, SMOSH would’ve been dead. Having both Ian and Anthony back making the videos they USED to make has been so amazing!
I remember the beginnings of YouTube and Smosh.
❤❤❤🥹🥹🥹🥹
No matter where you work or what field, the feeling of “have you seen the email?” is universal.
I saw your draw my life video I feel bad that you suffered night terrors if I was there I would sleepover your house in case you don't have night terrors and I would there for you backing up and Ian Hecox would be there also and that reminds me I made my first episode animation Clint, Hal, Bubbles and Luxo Jr. The show it was my first time making this but the second is still in the work cause animation is hard work
Funnily enough I don't think I ever watched a Smosh video, and didn't even realize Anthony's background before like a few days ago. I just knew him as the guy who makes very good interviews with interesting people.
52:12 he had a Jack Skellington moment
1 year anniversary
Coming back to this almost a year later, and it’s incredible to see what the channel’s done in such a small amount of time. I also wanted to single out something Ian said at 45:06 cause it’s so true to life and I hadn’t picked up on it before
The fact Anthony had HSP and I had no idea, I had this and it is crippling, can't believe I didn't know this.
There’s no channel i’ve ever pulled for more throughout my entire 23 y.o life. Love you guys, thanks for all the memories and looking forward to all the new ones!
The hug was supposed to be a wholesome ending and Ian really said welcome back... To my old shit, here's a little dance and there's the soon to be fanfics😂 they're perfect for each other
I couldn't stand Smosh back in the day, but it was sad to see them split years ago, knowing they were childhood friends. Ian seems to have gone through a really tough time feeling like he lost his best friend and trying to hold his company together through a rebuild, growth, and pandemic.     I'm glad they're back owning Smosh, and I like who they are now. They remind me so much of Rhett & Link
Okay but when Anthony starts to tear up and then they show the childhood photos of them two 😭  I shed a tear or two
such a blessing to have a friendship like this
42:02    1:11:32
Is it me or does Ian look healthier?
Friendship always wins
W teacher for pairing y'all
44:34 fin.
Honestly, I think my favorite video you guys did was the one where there was a ghost in your house and it was making all these weird noises and it’s my favorite video because I didn’t get the joke when I saw it as a kid and as an adult, I watched it and I immediately gasped like i freaked out and it was just hysterical like the prospective on that video was just so funny 😂😂😂😂
Ian 41:59: 🥶
51:03 personal timestamp
this is my roman empire.
Yk, I hope some day I would get the opportunity to be able to be on this “show/podcast” with people I grew up with (either one(the original smosh “people”))
From guys who make jokes that appeal to kids to guys who are doing the most grown up thing ever: talking about their feelings
MAN IM OVER HERE ALMOST ABOUT TO START BAWLING AT THE END AFTER WHAT IAN SAID THEN SECONDS LATER HES LIKE "Im gonna start an onlyfans"
this ian guy really matches anthony's energy, they should start a channel together!
I mean six years out of decades of friendship you can definitely come back from but all that time I’m glad you guys can have each other back again. Idk what it would be like if I fell out with my best friend from kindergarten
❤❤❤❤❤❤
hey i know him from somewhere
The best Duo
Does anyone else think their relationship is the ultimate rom-com? its chock full of emotion and depth, so interesting to hear and see
Thanks for everything guys, you rock!
"I do my thing and you do your thing. You are you and I am I; and if in the end we end up together, it's beautiful."
1:50 they should do some more bouncing on each other 🤭
OMGGGG?? He invited Ian 9 months ago and I just hear about it?? 😭😭😭😭
Ian sounds like Mr. Beast
27:34 Ian checking the message, "Congratulations!" - Rhett and Link
It’s hard to stay afloat when everything else sinks. Mad respect for Ian to still hold on to the boat.
Absolutely getting me a membership!
Imagine if they made Smosh: The Movie, but it was the real behind the scenes story of Ian and Anthony and how they were driven apart and came back together again
That hug made me shed a fucking tear and warmed my heart. Ughhhh I miss yall so fucking muchhh❤❤😢😢.
The deep moment we all wanted that hit deeper than we all expected ❤ Thank you to rhett and link from the mythical crew for giving the smosh crew the chance to be unapologetically themselves ❤
Ian and Anthony are like kidneys, you only need one but it feels better to have two :)
Kinda liked smosh the movie , maybe i just liked Smosh
He cox your mom up😂🤨
Their story could literally be a plot for a movie i'll be bawling my eyes out to 😭🥹
WELP. I have been watching Padilla's stuff unsubbed but still came across my feed often enough that I watch a video at least a month. I've always been like "He looks so familiar, why does he look so familiar" I finally know why. Smosh. I feel so dumb right now. I used to watch Smosh stuff all the time back in the day. It's the hair's fault, totally the hairs fault.
smosh the movie was a "fun bad" movie just because anthony and ian were starring in it
I hope ians dark humor never leaves😭😭😭
Could we get a day with old smosh games cast??
These guys have been blessed with a great journey and friendship but life moves on and people grow apart. I’m a bit concerned their coming together again will not last very long… all part of how things go, though! I loved the og cd wall.
Makes me cry to see y’all together you know reminds me of me and my bestfriend
Ngl, this whole story is reminding me of my brother and I. When I left my home, my brother was left there to take care of everything. I wanted to find my own way and our relationship was not good. I cut off completely and eventually him and I reconnected.
I feel like Ian is so drained still, I want to give him a hug
I still love the old Smosh sketches tbh they are my favorite, not to be disrespectful knowing it has been a struggle behind the scenes. I'm not really sure when it started expanding into other cast members, and no disrespect to Ian or the other cast though I was glad to see Anthony back also but I still watch the old skits because they are just timeless for me.  Anthony is very emotionally intelligent and self aware. It's really good to see you two were able to reconnect. The old Smosh videos will always be classic and timeless. I do feel like Ian is still being guarded, but people deal with their emotions differently. Hopefully they will be able to rebuild their friendship stronger than ever. Also I remember you both being hilarious. Tbh I haven't checked out your new sketches yet, I wasn't even aware you were making that kind of content again but I am about to.
youre both hot and both funny
I grew up with smosh i even had the silly lil shut up app on an old ass iphone. The announcement that yall were back together made me cry. I put off watching this because i knew i would cry. AND I DID 🥺🥺🥺
Parts of this remind me of when Ross and Rachel got back together and Rachel gave Ross a big list and he didn't read it and when he did he was pissed and when they were in bed Rachel just pushes him too far. Anthony is Rachel and Ian is Ross
Very proud of how yall two turned out! Yall two are my childhood and I can’t thank yall enough for the countless hours of entertainment you guys shared
this episode feels like a good piece of closure
I remember back in 2012 when I just had a kindle fire with Minecraft and smosh and the donut war videos were the best these guys were my childhood, I never liked PewDiePie. I just liked how creative and at home feeling type of production and effort they would really put into a skit. Everything about it to me looked like a legit TV show and I do think it made me grow up faster because some of the jokes I really didn’t understand at the age 8
Half of these views are me 😭
These guys are fucking legends
I’m crying my eyes out so fricking hard
OMG
How come he wears that same shirt in the smoosh icon
Bring back OG smosh!
As someone who grew up with “prime” smosh, my god was it an experience. Was I a nerd who got bullied a lot in school? Yeah, cause I was neurodivergent and wasn’t aware that was a thing. Yet, Smosh was there. They have brought joy to my life when I was a sad little, self shitting child… now I’m turning 21 this year… and I feel old hearing all this shit resurface again. Thank you Anthony and Ian for unintentionally making me laugh in days where I needed one as a kid. I wouldn’t have had it any other way :)
So proud of yall ❤❤ look how far yall came so proud of you guys you were young and strong What a boss move look what wonderful life ❤
THE GOSPEL (updated)   Hello guys! May I have your attention even for just a second? this might take awhile btw haha-(this will get long)  I would like to share something to all of you, feel free to read what I have to say,  whether you may read this or not it is your free will if you will stay, but if you wish to leave then go ahead and do so,  I am in NO way, shape or form trying to force this unto anyone, just scroll down if you dislike or feel offended of this.   However, if you do, it IS and can be a missed opportunity to know more about this topic of truth. I am not forcing you to stay, for I am quite aware that many of you may have had a very bad experience with people sharing their belief or ideology in the past.  On behalf of those people, whoever they may be, I truly apologize, I'm just trying to create a safe space for every person, mentally, physically, spiritually and emotionally.  But even so, try to listen, even for just a bit :)  The Gospel is free to absolutely everyone, no matter what religion, race or background etc. you may have been in.  Everyone is welcome to accept this free gift :D  Anyways, let's start!  -------  Sin was passed upon all men by one man  Adam, and death is a consequence of this sin  (Rom 5:12).   Mankind has an eternal destiny of  condemnation and wrath – Hell – because of  this sin (Rom 6:23).   No matter what good  works one might do we are still found sinners in the sight of our Creator God.   And all un righteous and those who follow get His wrath.  BECAUSE We cannot be found  Righteous for by God’s law we are found sinners (Rom 3:19-20).  If we have broken even one law we are found guilty.  Just a simple curse, a roll of an eye, a lustful look or even just by being ourselves, is already subjected to Hell fire, because no matter what we do this isn't at all worthy of anything, even our own good are compared to filthy rags.  (Isaiah 64:6)  That is also why the LAW is there to STOP our mouths for us to REALIZE we can NEVER do it. (Romans 3:19)  Now because of this reason of not being able to  create our own righteousness and being born  in a sinful flesh that we need a SAVIOR (Titus 3:5).   Now on to the GOSPEL.   That savior is Jesus Christ.  Salvation was finished and DONE by HIM and every ounce of our salvation RESTS ONLY BY HIS SACRIFICE. Once we trust He saved us, gave us eternal life, reconciled us by HIS blood, we are SEALED by the Holy spirit of promise, till the day of redemption. (Ephesians 4:30)  THEN HE LEADS us to our purposes of righteous practical living, based on OUR NEW identity in Christ , as REASONABLE service and NOT to "work our way to salvation"(because remember, there is NON good but GOD(Mark 10:18) but to simply act as God's children, because HE LOVED US SO MUCH that Jesus died for us.  That's the service we can give because of such an impact JESUS did WILLINGLY, it is our gratitude and not an act of trying to earn what we can NEVER achieve.   It is a FREE GIFT(Romans 6:23) afterall, you can't earn a gift, because that wouldn't be a gift anymore, but a reward, and remember, Jesus dying is not worthy of any of us, we do not DESERVE such a great sacrifice, that is why you also can't earn salvation on your own, because we just CAN NEVER do it.   And Jesus died EXACTLY for ALL of that, because He loves us too much.   This simple Gospel message is also in:  1 Corinthians 15:1-4 King James Version(for a more simple summary)  "15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures"  NOTHING added to it because it's JUST THAT SIMPLE! :D  There's more about the Gospel out there that I highly suggest, like Renee Roland for further assurance and Mark Dejesus for the psychological aspects of being a Christian.  Anyways that's it! if you made it till the end, than I am HIGHLY grateful for giving me this chance to share to you!  God bless and TAKE CARE! <3   (idk I'm just so passionate about this because so little so few people know the simple message of the Gospel of Christ, or even take it seriously at that T^T thanks so much for reading tho! Means a lot to me.  AND By the way, often once saved always saved is trashed in the Christian community, now I can't force you to trust my words for we shouldn't trust anyone but God. So decipher things for yourselves and let God show you the wonders of what He has done for you)
I’d totally read the fanfic.
Ian saying ‘watch or you’re a piece of shit’ and then five seconds later, ‘let’s burn this to the ground, together’ ☺️
I'm so so proud of Ian for how emotionally mature he was throughout this whole interview and honestly ever since Anthony left Like people made jokes about "where's Anthony" all the time and you could tell how much Ian was hurt by it but he never made a big deal about it I'm so glad they're friends again and Ian can fully heal  He's a fucking strong human being and my heart goes out to him  The way he kept Smosh going all these years and has really grown so much It's been just incredible seeing his journey and I'll forever support him
How can we meet our heroes? Will smosh be going to conventions or shows??
They both aged so well
ian and anthony are my childhood fr. i remember watching their shit on my xbox 360 with my friends when my mom wasn’t around.
This was so emotional. I completely understand Anthony's situation and all of his emotions. Actually he is more emotional person than Ian is. And this was "the point" why all of this had to go on its low. Anthony needed time to deal with his emotions, to learn how to express them correctly especially when you are a social media star , completely a two different characters in one person! And he did it! Ian is actually more calm and close, that is why it was easier to him to let go of all the problems in company. To everyone who said Ian was emotionally distant in this video - you are wrong. This is just his personality. He feels it a lot, he just doesn't need to express all of that. And the point is the boys accepted all of this for them and it worked! This is what adulthood is. To accept who you really are.
Milk fan fic you say? What’s that about?
I definitely think Ian hit the nail on the head when he realized that the new SMOSH concept should be the the whole team. I love not just the cast members but the moments with the staff as well. They created an environment of family, friends, humor, and professionalism. It is everyone that makes SMOSH so great. It’s great seeing how far they’ve come and they are both great guys and deserve so many good things.😁
🕰
like this if you miss the bowl cut to
That’s amazing. I didn’t know that you guys were so close needed to Ret in link because of that that’s amazing.
This feels like couples therapy
This honestly felt like "2 years time skip" moment in One Piece, but more epic. I relate to One Piece, because its my favourite Anime, and Smosh is my favourite Youtube Channel. Welcome back, Antony and Ian Bros.
I am a big fan of your video and your youtuber I really wish u could call Quackity for a post casts
27:29 I’m glad y’all brought the sketches back. It’s weird, but sometimes things need to fall out to come back together and be better. That kinda seems to apply yalls friendship and the sketches
Please make a smosh 2 that includes some of the new cast and characters. Like I would absolutely love to see Sarah Christ, Redacted, and Lulu in a smosh movie lol 😂
Who doesn't know Smosh? "Stub your toe, Firetruck!"
anthony left them blindly. i had nothing to do with smosh and i was feeling hurt..i feel for Ian cause he was left with the company and Defy thing happened. he carried the company through the shit. props to him!
Thank you for letting us hear this personal conversation. I learned a lot about friendships and I was able to process a conflict I had with my friend
Link for milk fanfic pl0x
did any fans of this channel actually not know what smosh is before this video? not discredit padildo as a content creator, i love this channel and the community hes created with it, but i just cant imagine a world that someone doesnt immediately associate smosh with both its founding members
The subtitlist apparently doesn't know what Goatse is. "look up goatse or blue waffle instead" became "look up goat tier blue waffle instead"
41:38 this is such a powerful moment.🥲
Who tf doesn't know what smosh is
I'm from the same town y'all started in (: I remember being a kid when y'all were filming in the parks (early early videos). Me and my best friend roamed the area and hung out. We tried not to creep on you, but we'd walk to DC Park and and O'Donnell Park after school and on weekends.   Now I'm in my mid 20's, just returned to Sacramento after some years in the Marine Corps, going to the college a mile away. I get massive nostalgia waves walking my dogs in the same parks. Early Youtube was so wonderful. I miss the non corporate days, but I am thankful for all the channels, jobs, and unique content available. This video was recommended to me on random, but it feels right as I just returned home. Maybe this is my omen to reconnect with her. We stopped talking after she moved to Texas and I joined the military. I'm glad you two are opening up and working together. My old friend and I have a lot to talk about.
Just noticed that this one’s an hour
"how many times have you watched this"? yes
May the Smosh be with You....
hamilton and burr whith a good ending.
Im sorry what!? Smosh is back! I cant breathe.
The Ian-Anthony story is my favorite rom-com 🥺🥰
15
13:37
Okay I have watched this so many times and I'm still on the verge of tears.
I've watched this over and over again. I love you two so much.
I was on smosh since firetuck song. That used to bump sooo hard in the mazdaspeed..it’s great to see you guys still mobbin together,because most duos don’t. Keep on keepin’ on.👍 great content
I LOVE HOW THEY MENTIONED THE FANFICS AT THE END LMAOO 😭
aww omg my heart. this was such a sweet and wholesome episode and i'm so late :') but UGH WOW. When Anthony was tearing up at 41:48 my heart like ACHED in the best way because like... wow you can feel like the weight of just SO MUCH between their relationship and to feel like it wasn't lost is powerful.
He looks exactly like my uncle in law
I don’t know how to explain this, but I think this video was the one where I saw Anthony feel the most comfortable about talking? Like about how he feels instead of the other person. like there’s plenty of Ian talking, but I just think it’s very wonderful that he feels comfortable enough when he’s sitting down with Ian that he can like participate in the conversation and put more of his thoughts and feelings into it
This is exactly what happened with Rick & Morty with Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland. It’s a real shame. Just two people thinking about their projects in their own way.
Been watching smosh since like 2010 I’m 19 now and there still funny
I got super nostalgia from that CD wall, I remember doing the same thing after watching your vids lol
Very insightful, honest and candid conversation. Thank you for opening up not just to each other, but allowing the world to learn and appreciate your relationship dynamic. You show a powerful example to the world of reconciliation, growth and genuine friendship.
Rhett and Link were the last chopper out of Nam
39:45 there was a typo in the captions.
It seems like Link is really fond of Ian from what Ian tells about the meeting with Rhett and Link, and from the interactions we saw of them. I really like that for some reason
From a business standpoint, let’s talk about how impressive what Ian did actually was. He was handed a failing business after stripping all of its resources, and told to make it work, or else his whole livelihood is ruined, and he somehow kept them afloat. That’s some extremely impressive work by Ian
there's a lot of bad things happening at 2023, but this is the w that reminds me that there are still good things
i love you guys, 5 months late but congratulations and welcome back! ❤
From an OG fan of Smosh standpoint, I really am just SO proud of you both, and love you BOTH, and I am so happy to see you guys talking so raw about your time together and I just wish you both the absolute best in life, ALWAYS 🥹🥰💖
On my third rewatch 💀💀
didnt know any of this. Good to see you guys back together.
The relationships where you haven't really talked or seen each other but feels like no time has passed are the real ones
I love the Smosh Movie!!! It was absolutely hilarious to ne
I want a Smosh the Movie.. but ABOUT SMOSH.. like the entire journey
You two guys are such good compliments to each other! I love how they legit friendship just allows them to embrace their inner awkwardness while avoiding the trap of modern cringe!
I personally loved SMOSH The Movie😅😂
I forgot Anthony was in Smosh and I really thought “where’s the rest of them”
Thank you both for sharing this stuff. It gives so much context to the fans that have been watching your stuff since early on. Beyond that, it's also really interesting to hear the story of Smosh, one of the earliest influential presences on social media that is still in the public eye and making content. But also the story of Ian and Anthony, the human beings beneath the polished product of business.
Rhett and Link being so supportive of Ian and Anthony is a genuinely beautiful parallel. AAAAAAH.
It's beautiful to see two grown men reconnect and find each other again. Genuinely, you can see the difference in them both as well as the difference in Smosh. Beautiful.
Did I cry? Yes.
me and my best friend of 7 years had a bad falling out for a year, i reached out when i felt like all the bad feelings towards each other went away and we are different ppl now then when we knew each other. but the way we got to rebuild our relationship was rly healthy and i’m glad we fell out for a bit cause i feel like things would’ve gotten worse and then things would’ve been unfixable between us.
The part where Anthony gets really emotional and says he realised his childhood friend was still there really got me.
:)
they are gonna show this video in psychology classes
This is such a trip. Honestly I love both Ian and Anthony with my whole heart. They both raised me and where with me through some rough times, seeing them back together again makes me very happy.
Drink everytime ian says 'like'
Content creators being self aware about fanfiction really gets me man.
Watching this video rn and it brought so many emotions. These two are the epitome of early 2000’s childhood icons. I’m glad these two are together again. They are clearly soulmates.
The fact that I remember when Smosh first launched makes me feel so old. 😅
I love how you’ve been able to sit and talk things through in a mature and calmed way. Guys, thank you for coming back!! ❤
thx⚘ 4 all the🏆🏆Funn'times🌐 🏠we 🏡all 🏘🌐Enjoyed🤗😉😄 more than u both know 💙💙All our🍀 Best 🍀to u+ 💞your families💞
This is a true friendship Despite what happened between them they found a way back to each other
"don't you know what you got till it's gone"  Congratulations, you guys did what Halston couldn't. He sold he name for comfort and couldn't bought it back for the rest of his life.
I know it was a joke but I stan Anthony even more for saying it's okay if Ian starts an Onlyfans and he'd subscribe just to support. No slut shaming or being derogatory to sex work from these men. How far they've come from those teen boys hiring 'big boobs bikini" in their sketches. 😊 This whole thing was just incredibly wholesome
When this originally happened I had pretty much just started watching Smosh and nursing a heartbreak. In a way the hope and sweetness of this was too painful because I knew it wasn't going to happen in my case. Now I'm still pretty sure it won't but it doesn't hurt quite as much and I've reconnected with a different friend who once hurt me and we fell right back into our friendship of 4 years ago so I definitely relate to a lot of elements of this.
The pokemon video was the first yt video i watched and i was a hardcore Smosh fan and i cried when it wasnt you guys. I also used a screen name like "smoshgirl93" or something. SMOSH IS YOU GUYS
You should do a video where you interview ASMR artists! That would be fun
Man, this doesn't feel healthy at all.. it's like Anthony just brought Ian on to make him feel bad for being upset about anything in their history. Like more of "I was always in the right and you were always wrong and here's why".. I don't know.
I used to watch Smosh in the 2010s and since this year I started watching it again
hello anthony those are some nice boots where may i get th boots  chhers
Trail Blazing legends!
only like 10 minutes in but I have to say I think it's so funny to hear that adults thought smosh was for 10 year olds cause I remember being 10 and thinking "smosh is way too inappropriate for me-" so I'd cherry pick which videos I watched and click off the moment anything went "too far" in my mind lol
In conclusion, SMOSH is the NWA of the YT world 😅
🥲🥰
"My childhood friend is still here" thanks im crying
can I say that I am incredibly proud of you both for achieving something good but also the break Anthony you took was detrimental to your mental health and a break from working constantly as well. true friends and real friends will always return into each other's lives. Keep up the good work
Rhett and link's are so clutch
The fact that Ian had to become numb in order to cope with everything is just..so heartbreaking. No one should go through that and I can't imagine all the stuff Ian had to deal with and I couldn't be more glad that they're back together. I haven't watched any Smosh videos lately, but I hope Ian's doing better with Anothony back in the picture and with their friendship becoming stronger once again. My best wishes go out to them. My childhood heroes.
Please do one with Ian’s mom.
This has been a joy to watch develop these past few months. It's just incredible. I was one of those kids who watched them at youtubes beginning. The evolution of smosh has been like a movie 😉
I did enjoy the movie.
being reminded of milk fanfic in the year 2023 is actually insane
32:25 the moment we’ve all been waiting for
I have never heard rofl be used literally
Like like like like like like like like like like like hold of on the likes!
KISS
It’s like watching your divorced parents get back together 🥺
Soooooo happyyyyyy
Hearing the full story of their friendship, it sounds like it would make a very effective and emotional “based on a true story” film.
Big ones inside
My life has gotten better since they've been together
Proud of y’all for opening up and growing so much as individuals💗💗
This looks like an interview between a modern porn director and his mentor~
the straightest BoyFriends
i dont know if im the only one but i wanted to share that watching this has made me happy i used to love watching smash as a kid years ago and hearing anthony leaving smosh ruined smosh for me and i lost where he went for a few years and for the past 2 years i found out alot of stuff that happened and just hearing and seeing this now made me cry and im so happy to see that anthony and ian have come back together though everthing has changed over the years so i hope everything goes well
This really touches me I experienced something similar with my friend. I wish this video was out sooner so if I saw this sooner maybe I would've talked to my friend differently
i absolutely adore you anthony and ian. you have made me cry from happiness seeing you two smile together again. i missed it so much dudes
OH BABY OH BABY DO I KNOW SMOSH OH BABY OH BITCH OH BITCHH I WATCHED UNTIL ANTHONY LEFT AND THEN SYOPPED AT THE TRY NOT TO LAUGH WATER CHALLENFES I BEEN HERR W YOU GUYS SINCE THE BEGINNING I FUCKING LOVE YOU TWO
Why is Ian so fruity
“If we burn it to the ground I’m happy to do that with you”
You should bring others from smosh on
❤
You should do a video on people with specie's dysphoria
Listening to this is so healing for every friendship
Wow these two should make a YouTube channel together!
I like the movie 🤣
Thats insane love you guys watching u since the beginning of smosh so happy smosh is back together
You guys should start a YouTube channel together, you two are a great duo 🔥
I love the movie ❤
Heh cox
Ian is the better friend, Anthony is the better artist. I'm just pleasantly surprised that my past decade of researching Smosh lore won't go to waste.
Anothy dresses gay😅
Mad props to you both for doing a lot of your reconnecting this way online showing healthy communication and hashing things out openly after having done a lot privately, way to set an example for any young adult out there about accountability, responsibility, and just being respectful people. Loving the content as always and thank you for the good work you do ❤
i feel blessed. anthony & ian inspired me to make skits & parody videos when i was in middle school & high school lol
i will watch smosh forever. idc how old i am. it’s healing to watch
Is That Your Friend
I didn't know that Rhett & Link owned Smosh.  I'm so glad that Anthony & Ian bought it back!!
That low hug is giving “we are Stephen Tennerman”
3:40 explains everything why they gotten to film inside Chuck E. Cheese for the "Crybaby" sketch with Ian going "Chuck E. isn't real?"
Yo shoutout to Diana. She an MVP frfr.
I feel like this wasn't an interview and just Anthony and Ian venting out and becomeing friends again
I didnt realize how much I was still emotionally influenced by these two, but when they started being more honest i couldnt help but cry 😭
Friendship always wins
Honestly guys... I would love to see That Damn Neighbor part 5???  I know it may be a bit silly but... there is nothing wrong with doing a few sequels maybe???  I mean Food Battle and That Damn Neighbor are kind of classics of Smosh. I mean That Damn Neighbor is way more "niche" than Food Battle. But it wouldn't kill anyone seeing those again, I mean not just for "nostalgia" but just for fun? Maybe?  I mean... fans may have their own dreams too right? lol
45:56
(This is like Naruto and Sasuke talking to each other about why they are always friends, Beautiful. )    This is the perfect example of why business is ALWAYS AND NEVER PERSONAL AT THE SAME TIME    Which is bs and always will be    its completely BS they couldn't be reunited until recently.   A friendship and love for your friend should never be destroyed by corporate greed.   Thank you so much for coming back together. You are some of of the great...... keep doing you.    People should owm themselves
please someone tell ian that he looks like the most adorable elementary school teacher and it's awesome. man needs to know that (i hope he does) he is the loveliest and most wholesome youtuber of all time. when he said about his therapy sessions i felt bad for him he didn't deserve all that shiet he went through 😢 i wish him nothing but the best cuz he is the best.
I want to understand so Rhett and Link own Smosh but Ian And Anthony also own Smosh, is it like 4 way ownership ???
I'm happy that as youtube has aged, it feels like the content and the creators have matured alongside it :)
Good thing y’all back fuck them other people y’all the OG’s  of smosh get the show back watched y’all grow
41:40 Yep, that got me good. Holy shit.
i had managed to erase the milk fanfic from my brain and they had to remind us all like 12 yrs later
I want our friendship to last this long, maybe even further.
Anthony for reals what does that painting mean? the plush thing looks so creepy
Its like insane how much smosh has influenced me. I started watching smosh in 2012 so when i was 13 and even when they added the new cast I continued to watch and love them all and i was absolutely heartbroken when Anthony left but i stayed and supported both channels. I absolutely adore the newer cast, and have probably watched every video they've made since. I can't tell you how much i cried when i saw the announcement that they bought it back and became friends again. I see Ian's haopiness since anthony came back and i see the quality in their videos go up, Anthony's joy when hes doing gsmes and challenges with the Smosh cast im just so so so happy that they found eachother. And to Ian, thank you so much for staying with smosh because youve created and grown something beautiful and i will always be grateful for that ❤️
‘Cyberspace celebrities.’ Well that dated their first tv appearance. 😂
I still watch the smosh movie
This is still so surreal that I’ve watched this video at least 10 times since it was published 😢 I still can’t believe that my first youtube heros brought back everything I loved about them 🎉❤
these guys really have chemistry, they should make a channel together!
I was like 7 when i started watching smosh
As someone who subbed to Smosh since 2012-2013 and is now 25, married, and a month pregnant, Im not only happy to evolve with the two of you and the other amazing people who are now part of it, I'm so proud of the growth I've seen from the two of you as Men, as Individuals, as Friend's, and as Creators. Congratulations, you two!
aww, his laugh is kinda cute 🥹
So happy to see you together again and vulnerable
I don't know if they will even see this comment but I strongly feel like they should collaborate with Shane and Ryan from watcher. Their comedy styles would be so cohesive and would work. When smosh was in a bad place ryan and Shane took that place with buzzfeed unsolved. I'm just saying man if you guys even see this I've supported you since I was 16 and I just think its a good idea.
GYAAAT
I forgot about the milk fanfic and had gotten back to a normal life.
I disagree with the whole kids content thing, when they were 8 they weren't doing smosh, so when 13-25 year olds watch smosh they don't stick around because they're at that age where it just gives them drive to do something themselves and that's why alot of youtubers came up from smosh
Ian looked very emotional to me, idk why some people say he's distant lol
42:11 damn
To see how dramatically Ian and Anthony have grown and matured as people makes me so happy 🥹🥹 these two were literally my childhood growing up 😊
MY FUCKING GOD! THEY ARE BACK TOGETHER!!!
45:20
This proves nature is healing. Thank you guys for the years of content and seeing you guys are still the creative duo you once where
Food Battle when ? X3
Honestly cannot see anthony or ian without eachother maybe thats just my opinion but i grew up on these two the second anthony left and the company was bought i hadnt really watched them since until now maybe its just the little kid in me thats wishs i could see these videos for the first time ever again i love these two men because they are a big part of my life and i cant see them without each other
Don't know if anyone else has said it but props to Ian's friend Diana for pushing for them to talk again
I'm so happy that these two reconnected but why the milk fanfic. That one coulda stayed in the dirt lol
That CD wall is forever ingrained in my brain
Watch in HD 1080p only
i can see why rthett and link were so supportive. besides the fact that they're wholesome and great guys, Ian and Anthony are probably the only other youtubers and maybe people who can relate to them with the whole best friends since kids and creating a buisness together on youtube. both gmm and smosh revolved around two cool dudes being best friends. strikes too close to home for them to reject the offer of selling smosh back to ian and anthony.  im glad things are happening the way they are
this is a "If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it's yours. If not, it was never meant to be" type of friendship
Never seen anthony laugh so openly and so much with someone and never seen ian so vulnerable on camera but he genuinely seems so happy just talking with anthony Im so happy for these two best friends man
Coming back to this every week coz im just so happy i can say ian and anthony again in 2023
what does he mean by mori episode?? i’ve been trying to figure it out for so long :((
Im a little late. Did they make a smosh Eat Shit Repeat Tshirt? Id buy that.
also love ian but he looks like an old cocaine dealer in this video lol
im sorry you guys ever had to go thru your battles with everything you talked about but im so glad you guys are back i really missed you guys smosh was never the same to me without the both of you i hope everything grows and you guyss live your best life together
This is happy ending
42:41 let me wipe that tear for you Anthony.
i was always attracted to both of them and always loved them as a comedy duo and seeing there friendship
19:47 Ian really shows how well he knows Anthony here cause they weren't talking much by this point, but he could still see exactly what was going on with Anthony's early videos.
Smosh the movie is my favorite movie
I get that several years SUCKED for you 2 in regards to each other but I am so glad you´ve found your way back together as friends and the fact that you managed to get to this place is amazing. I am so proud of Anthony, Ian, the whole Smosh cast, Rhett and Link (thank you guys for saving smosh and making this possible) and Mykie for being so sweet and helpful. I´m so freaking proud of you guuuuyyyys!
Congrats Anthony and Ian for getting Smosh and your friendship back. Also Thank you for sharing and explaining what was going on between you two, Smosh, and personal issues.
I think everyone wants to have a friendship like Ian And Anthony have, My biggest fantasy is too have a Brutha or Friend willing to make videos with me, goof off and have fun XD, The closest I'll get is the occasional sleep overs (i do hang out a lot, but i mean like, LIVING with my brutha/friend) , but yeah Hope you 2 are doing well! You guys did inspire me a lot! and i am thankful for that.
Through the entire conversation of Smosh being "for kids" I was like "no, but I watched Smosh, it wasn't for kids". Y'all. I was the kids. I was 13 in 2005. I was the fkin kid.
Yall need to keep in mind that these two are back to being friends again, theyre adults and are self aware of their lack of communication early on in their friendships just because they dont break it down on camera doesnt mean they didnt discuss or even get emotional after or before the camera goes off
When my therapist asks me why I'm so happy lately I'll show them this video 😅 my childhood has healed
I'ma start back watching smosh
Whoever was that teacher who paired these two deserves to be praised.. Anthony: We have never expressed emotionsIan: I still won’t Me: .
We love smosh
Nice interview. I would like to see you two in Triggernometry one day.
Can we have a I spent a day with the Smosh cast?
I'm ngl. I always hoped you would buy smosh and work on it again. When I heard of defy going down and rheet and link buying smosh I honestly thought it would happen sooner. I remember about a week before your annocement thinking why don't Anthony and Ian just buy smosh back together?
I was a year old when Smosh started on YouTube. I'll be watching Smosh for the first time as an adult. It's so cool seeing an og channel continue to reach new audiences almost 20 years later.
Rhett and Link are Ian and Anthony from the future and the saved themselves
abc123 come along and sing with me
I feel like the whole experience just shows that Ian and Anthony are just people at the end of the day and it's really making me appreciate and also question my own friendships. I don't think we will ever be over this reunion and how insane it is!
I'm late to the party, but yes!!! Hell froze over. My two favorite guys are back together again!!! Go Smosh!!!
Ian’s act of friendship inspired Anthony to learn the tech skills to create Smosh. Actually pretty beautiful!
I might not have been around YouTube in those days, but i understand the impact of smosh on everyone who watched them.
why no milk fanfic link in the description 👀
Yep
you two helped me out a lot. your videos helped me feel not as alone when i was 18-19. im very happy you are reconnecting. thank you
i like your shoes Anthony
NOT THE MILK FANFIC
It's been forever since I last saw these two and I've missed hearing Anthony's laugh, lol.
Glad you two are back together!
well FINALLY
Pokemon theme song REVENGE was my discovery of smosh. And I stopped watching a few years ago, once all the other people started showing up and once the reveal video popped up I have been shown that IAN is the serious and deep thinking one and I never pictured him as the smart one due to me being a preteen and Ian's character
I once thought the way to say Ian hecox was Ian HEY COCKS
SHUT UP!
smosh troupe back together is blursed
Smoshhhhh
based
What is the "Milk" fanfic?
such reunion
smosh was my child hood
This. Is. Beautiful! It feels like the Internet is a little more complete now. It feels like healing. I’m glad Smosh continued so that this can finally happen. 😭❤️
I only just saw this today but I feel like it’s true that everything works it’s self out and im happy to see we’re getting back are roots
48:04 I'm not crying, you crying. Love them and their friendship 🥲
Just came back from Ryan Higa’s “Off The Pill Podcast”   Ryan manifested this when he said “what if you had Ian on the show?!” When interviewing Anthony
I am sooo happy that they are getting back together! So excited for the upcoming videos from them!
he is probably not watching that episode
Oh, I thought you were interviewing Hasan Piker.
why is Anthony so zesty?
Can you please do a "I spent a day with Rebal D"
Aah I love you guys so much and I’m so happy that you found your way back cause I grew up watching smosh (I’m still singing “firetruck” from time to time) so you’re very close to my heart..but Ian my man if I was to take a shot every time you say “you know” and “like” I would be black out drunk by the end of the video😂
Thank you
Theia mania is what happens when Ian and Anthony are together in the right moment. It’s like phil and Dan.
Kinda felt sad when Anthony said he wanted a real hug and Ian just continued with the funny hug
Am I the only one that thinks this is Ian is bored with Anthony’s perspective?
Is Ian gay?????????????
☺️ I binged all the new sketches since the reunion! Refreshing and my first real, hearty laugh this week. Our generation thanks you both for having Smosh as a silly comfort channel. Understandable, that you each had new experiences and growth over the years as well. 😁
❤❤❤❤❤
This was excruciating to listen to…. The overuse of the word “like” grinds my gears 😡
greatest ep on the channel
This vid got my smiling ear to ear, love to see you guys back together
Fugg yall are hot
I tired of this crybaby crap.  Just dance clowns
I want to see an i spent a day with the smosh cast. I think it would be great if we could see anthony spend more time and get to know the new members of smosh
I’m so happy for you both! I can’t wait to see what you create together again! Thank you for sharing this!
Couples therapy is a good idea
yessir im the 398,263th like
42:01
You two should bring back the og smosh biggest fan new smosh sucks
The boy are back 🍻
Maybe you can't tell by my profile picture, but I'm 23 now as of a couple of days ago, and I've been struggling with the idea of getting older lately, especially letting go of these friendships I once had... Honestly the past few years I've been denying that me and my once best friend might not ever be as close as we once were, even if we both wanted to. People change, people grow apart. I wish I could say that once you realize that, it's easy to move on... But I think that part of coming to terms with bittersweet situations is accepting what you can't change, and accepting the feelings you have right now. I like what Anthony said about letting go of the idea of what your relationship with someone you care about *should* be, and basically coming to terms with what it is. Even though I'm still sad, it gives me comfort knowing that it is possible to move forward and to know that other people have had similar experiences
BEST SMOSH VID IS 🌚🌚🌚 ogs know 💪
I can't believe they're back, amazing video.
Dude, I remember the pokemon revenge song and pokemon in real life and zelda in real life! I miss how those old videos made me feel back in the day.
No you haven’t, you’ve spent ages with him
These guys single handedly shaped my childhood and sense of humor
They came back. That's awesome. I miss smosh❤❤
I THINK ANTHONY READ MY MIND 😱😱😱
You know I tend to forget Anthony was a part of Smosh 😅
backwards curse words is still a banger to this day.
Proud of you guys, but why was this video so awkward
"my childhood friend that i grew up with is still here" "even if we burn it to the ground im glad to do it with you" DONT FUCKIN TOUCH ME IM VIOLENTLY SOBBING, THESE TWO GENUINELY LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH
not me rwatching this just coz i need more of these 2 toegther. i remember seeing this and thinking this was a joke lmao I CANT BELIEVE SMOSH R BACK IN 2023 ITs been a month and im still processing this honestly
MORTAL COMBAT!!!
If you don’t know what smosh is, you don’t deserve to know these two guys. 💀 Even people who don’t know their videos personally, know their name.
I love this. Its like Mythical, I give it to earbiscuits. These boys learned about how to express feelings.
maybe it was because i was a but younger but i truly enjoyed the smosh movie. I did really like smosh though so maybe you could’ve put your name on a bag of shit and i would’ve liked it, im not really sure
The last video before he came back to purchase Smosh with Ian
I am glad i found this channel, it brings me back down and reminds me i am a human again. I dont know if i recall smosh growing up but seeing the connection and passion you two have i decided to subscribe and see what its all about.
I really like his outfit and I’m trying to find the white shirt he’s wearing does anyone have idea where I can get it
i am so unbelievably happy about this. them mentioning how long smosh has been around was wild and just made me think about how i started watching them in elementary school and im 21 now. i am so excited for the future of the channel and it brings me so much joy how passionate they seem abt it, esp anthony. love u guys <3
I don’t know why, but my ADD and ODD always kept me from getting into YouTube back in the day. But it makes me sad, because I wish I hadn’t missed out on a lot of these channels.   I only ever really watched occasional NCIX Tech Tips and in turn LTT, and then Markiplier and the gang as they were coming up, then really got back into YT with Unus Annus.   Sorry I missed you guys back in the day! 🥲
Oww, Ian is a grumpy cynic, but when he lets the feels out, it’s amazing. Than ending!
Re-do sex Ed with I set my friends on fire
Supportive comment.
41:09 Ian i believe your looking for, "the more things change, the more they stay the same"
Smosh remeets
Woah!!! In one month this video has over 6m views!!! I think you both broke the Internet
Bring Food Battle 2023!!!
Ian low-key has vacc eyes
DAAAAAYUUUMMM
I feel like we're watching a real life love story. I hope the best for smosh - and for Rhett and Link too for that matter... Hero behaviour.
I had so many realizations watching this, thank you
I remember binge watching a fuck ton of smosh videos in my earlier days, my favorite videos were the fanmail ones though. It's absolutely relieving for me to hear that they are both willing to start over.
I swear seeing you two together again made my eyes water. I used to watch you every day, all day long when I was younger. But everyone goes on ig😊 I really liked the hug at the start
Molester moon
2:45 emo fight
Can you guys bring back the lunch vlogs lol
“if we burn it to the ground, im happy to do it with you” 😭😭😭😭😭😭
10:30 sorry but who lol
18:12
thus is the gayest straight couple and i mean this in the best  way possible❤
So yall weren't really friends? Damm coulda fooled me
Please bring back Smosh Games!!!
they loved each other so much as friends to let go of each other only to find each other again. they are platonic soulmates for sure
looks like the 2020s are all about nostalgia…feels really good to see that smosh is back again.
Omfg I waited so long for this
The universe has a weird way of making things work. Thank you Ian for continuing Smosh, and Anthony for coming back!
Rhett&Link x Smosh, the greatest collab of all time.
Such a mature convo. Grew up upon these dudes and it's really wholesome to see them come back together.
I’m a childhood fan since like 1st-2nd grade. I’m almost 22 now and I’m glad to see that they are mending the wounds and building back stronger
"A live action cartoon" so true
This makes me so sad. Just re watched their food battle from 2006 - 2014 while tripping. Currently watching Charlie the drunk guinea pig 2 and next up is smosh babies
HEAR ME OUT ANTONY PADILLA SPENDS A DAY WITH RAY WILLIAM JOHNSON!!!!❤
I stopped watching smosh when you 2 weren’t doing it together anymore but now I’m so glad you guys got back together as friends and as smosh creators who own smosh again I clicked instantly on the new smosh videos again because I saw that you 2 started videos again and I love it I’m so glad from being there from the start watching your videos and going into them once again! Keep doing what you guys are doing and never let this go again! 🎉❤
This interview healed earth
0:35 the only hug i will do for the rest of my life😂😂😂😂
Ian seems so jaded bruh
Ian feels sooo corporate and Anthony sooo feeling guided that the tension was going to build regardless,  not an ego thing which it is weirs nowadays.
Idk if y’all are fans of blink-182, but the first 30 minutes gave me heavy flashbacks of when they split up in 2005. The miscommunications, changing as people, the insecurities, the need to prove to yourself that you could make it on your own, and *most importantly* coupled with the pressure of maintaining the “best friends” public persona (Tom and Mark). Same situation, same age. History really does repeat itself. This was a really great watch.
I think it would be an interesting sketch if you two explored the alternative decisions a Smosh what if episode. You could do what if Anthony stayed? what if it was Ian who left instead? what if you both left at the same time? Could do it like that star trek episode where you see all the different enterprises and the scared riker pops up
thank u for letting us be a part of this friendship therapy session, loved it <3
This episode was very uncomfortable to listen to, but it was a good uncomfortable. These two have a hydrogen bond in the sense that they broke and came back together. Congratulation on acquiring Smosh once more. 💗💗
This is amazing
My childhood!!!! Thank youuu guysss <333
ok amazing now can the two of u pls bring back natalie tran xx
YAY SMOSH IS FRIENDS AGAIN 1000 YEARS OF WORLD PEACE AND PROSPERITY
I love Rhett and Link omg 🥹
So proud of you bros.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I guess you could say they were smoshing everything in sight
It's amazing to see both Ian and Anthony talk about their feelings around Smosh. I never even knew that a company was managing their channel. I can't even begin to imagine how hard it was to be working that much and doing so many different things. I really respect how much they both grew as people and that they are able to talk this all out now. It's amazing to see you two together, and congrats on rebuying Smosh!
Im late to this but i really needed to watch this. Been a longtime fan that did fall off watching during that Defy era. I came back in 2021 and enjoyed what I watched. While I dont think i will become a fan again like I did, I am very interested and excited to see what happens!
Ian is so relatable on an emotional level, he expresses appreciaton the same way as me. I talk about how I feel a little detached way - but I really mean it. He really does mean what he says and he tries his best to come across right. I do that too.
ian and anthony listened to refused?????? fucking based
You should do old smosh mail times again
So happy for you too
"if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you" Ian is such a romantic for that. my standards after this video📈
should do “I spent a day with Anthony Padilla” and Ian hosts
Omg it finally happened! I requested this so many times and right when I  gave up hope he finally did it! Yay! Thank you so much Anthony! 🎉
This might be the longest i spent a day with episode to date
one of the best friendships on youtube <3 i remember when i would watch your guys' videos on the wii with my siblings lol
i was smiling through this whole video
Ianh has grown so much man, he is so articulate with his words and the way he explains tells me he has like become the great dad of Smosh
Did they oil Ian's head or am i tripping
Wholesome
Glad you guys are back together :)
I loved the smosh movie
Does this mean lunchtime with Smosh is making a comeback??? 😩😩
These two reconnecting at the right time so that all of this could even happen is one of the biggest W’s I have seen in my entire life.
Fr, I have watched them during my childhood and when Anthony left, one part of my childhood was missing but damn this has healed my childhood and as a grown up, I finally understood what it meant for Anthony to leave which I mean this interview actually happened at the right time, like if I were to be at the age of 10 when this interview came about then I would defo not uds a single thing they were saying but as an adult, I get it. Altho im not young or a child anymore but thank you for filling that childhood gap for me. BRB I’m crying ❤
This has made me so happy in so many ways. I'm so happy you guys were able to resolve things as individuals and also resolve things together. It's also nice to relate to other people being influenced by what other people would comment on who you were as people.  I've had to learn who I actually was as an adult versus negative comments people would tell me going through school and early 20s. It's so relatable and encouraging to keep fighting for what you want in life. I didn't realize how much I needed this Anthony and Ian reunion, but it is wholesome af. ❤
clickbait. anthony padilla has definatly spent more than one day with ian hecox
So happy!!!
Anthony you have grown up so much! And your emotional intelligence is so amazing to see. Ian on the other hand, has mastered comic relief lmao 😂
This is beautiful, it’s been a long time coming & I’m so glad this happened… plus I love how Anthony talks about Mykie 😭
the world is healing. ❤
I think I contracted non hopchikins lymphoma when you had to explain smosh
Tbh I liked smosh babies
I wasn’t a die hard smosh fan, I grew up with it and would fall in and out of watching content but let me just say this. I am here and I have been speed running all their content to be a supporter because I see what these two have done to save their channel, and I am so excited to see them make the videos/sketches they wanna make. I believe in Anthony and Ian but I’m most excited for them in rekindling their relationship and doing what they love together as a duo, im ready for whatever they do!!
I’m glad y’all bought smosh. I used to love watching smosh until they started posting only every Starbucks ever videos I see lots of fans are happy to because the old vids used to get 400k views but once y’all posted u bought the Chanel the video got like 5 mil views
Ray William johnson
I never thought I would see this again. Me and my homie would watch and talk about all the new smosh videos when we were in elementary school. We are both respectfully 23 and 24 now. I still remember the zelda rap. Good times man.
i was never a big fan of smosh honestly but  appreciated the work you put in. I  am genuinely excited for you guys
This is such a good video that i didn't know i needed. From my perspective (a kid watching Smosh) i never knew what a parent company was. I thought it was just you guys with a camera having fun and all other people in the videos where just friends. Then when i heard smosh broke up all i heard is "theyre just not friends anymore" and from funny donut vids to not friends anymore felt so weird. However at that time i wasn't really a smosh fan anymore
When y’all started talking about the movie I started laughing so hard all I could think about was magic pocket slave monsters
Smosh brothers are back!!!
Ian saying “Like” so much was killing me
Thx for all of the memories
Legends never die and this proves it.
I love you guys but smosh cant be a business only like y'all said it should be two best friends making videos. Of course we love you trying to make it appealing to fans but its wholesome and respectable no matter what content you make as long as you guys both enjoy it and feel proud of it. Your friendship will always matter the most its an example to others
this is almost too good to be true as someone who was a fan of smosh over ten years ago
i wanna see food battle 2023 now
Glad to see Anthony and Ian together again❤️  This is Smosh just like the eldest days.  You were my first introduction to YouTube. What a great Intro.❤️
Imagine IF The Beatles had a talk like this one 😢
Anthony and Ian therapy session
So glad they own Smosh again
I LOVE THIS EPISODE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love you guys
This is such a good video.
Damn.... I have not seen Smosh in 3-4 yrs and Anthony is giving <3
I just might have to subscribe to Smosh again. It was literally the reason I made a YouTube account Long ago, cuz I wanted to give them likes, I enjoyed the videos that much
bro i watched smosh wen i was 1  you guys were and still are my favourite Youtubers
Gotta say this is definitely the best spent a day vid I love how it doesnt feel like an interview vid it’s just a vid about 2 matés reconnecting and talking about there history
I think u guys neeed to get lazer corn joven and sohinki back and get thebold team rolling
This is probably the first longest video anthony posted for years
This definitely deserves to be Anthony’s 400th video
they like to get lunch
Whoever was that teacher who paired these two deserves to be praised.
bring back sergeant anous
🧍🧍‍♂️
First of all, this was such an incredible and insightful watch! Thank you both for being so vulnerable and open about this experience, and overall just super excited for you both!  On a second note: i dont think I've ever heard someone use ROFL in a legit sentence before, let alone using rofl at all in 2023 so kinda iconic
i miss y’all
It's interesting how this interview gave me new perspective on Smosh .. the perspective that Anthony/Ian is the way to go ( KIDDING ! ! .. ? ? ? )
The way they describe their friendship deteriorating and how they would fight indicates just how comfortable and past it they are now. I had years of conflicts with my oldest and closest friends and this is more or less how we talk about it. And we certainly were never the faces of the biggest channel on Youtube or business partners and roommates.
I just watched the milk fanfic. And the lunchtime with Smosh were everyone was asking about milk related things and Ian knew, but Anthony didn’t. 10/10 do recommend
its great seeing how genuine they are with the audience and themselves now. they have truly grown
Would you spend a day with OGsog? (Original Smosh games crew)
Interview Jenna marbles in a 1 on 1 format plz
me chilling and watching this collab and seeing my childhood  out of the blue there’s ian sounding like jack at 1:01:40 😂
This was absolutely beautiful to watch❤
mhhh, a whole hour of ian saying "y'know" and anthony saying "yeah"
I'm one of the rare people who never watched Smosh. I was aware of them but never saw a single episode. Started watching Anthony and then found out who he was.  This video still shows tension between the two but maybe I just don't know there relationship enough.
I live both of them wish they made out 😢 sad anywhore happy y’all are back❤❤❤
As an og smosh fan I could never have any thing better than an hour of these two together
I just hope you don't end up leaving the studio you share with Mythical because the random crossover events are some of my favorites from both channels. Whether it's Trevor showing up on Try Not To Laugh, or Damien in the Mythical Kitchen, those always feel extra fun for some reason.
FIRST BITE 😂😂😂😂
I love that Rhett and Link were more excited about having Anthony and Ian together again at Smosh than they were about how much they'd get selling the channel back to them.
If only my brother could see this, may he rest in peice
58:51 Shaka Bruh (OLd Smosh Reference)
Defy Media didn't go along with it and now its dead and buried.
What's amazing is that Anthony did manage to create his own Identity after leaving Smosh, as I first knew Anthony as the Interview Guy, and only later I discovered everything about Smosh
After watching Roi and Alex Wassabi's "why we broke up" video after they also got* back together (as SpicyFruit), lowkey surprised that this was not as emotional. But I came to realize that Roi and Alex mended their relationship before making spicy fruit while Anthony and Ian may actually still be in the process of rebuilding their friendship.
Great video, guys. Hope all goes smoothly from now on. You guys are awesome!
I love Ian color matching😂
Man I always wonder if we were going to see anthony at least make a cameo appearance in smosh. This series of events during their repurchase of smosh was really amazing and wonderful!
well i just got lucky to find Anthony channel when he just started the i spent the day series and love him, at that time I don't even know smosh but now I'm here witnessing they got back together and also being introduced to smosh content🙌🏼
Lauv's song was all I could ever think about while watching this: [Never Not] "We were so beautiful We were so tragic No other magic Could ever compare.  I lost myself, seventeen Then you came, found me No other magic Could ever compare  There's a room In my heart with the memories we made Took 'em down, but they're still in their frames There's no way I could ever forget"
probably the most personal “i spent a day with”s
It would be really cool if you could do this with the OG Smosh games cast
Yo all I'm saying is Molester Moon better have a cameo
I’m so happy that this has happened 💖 I can’t wait to see everything that you guys do with smash moving forward 💖
Can't appreciate this video enough. Hearing the story of your friendship and how you almost resigned to not being friends sounds so similar to my current situation, and you two have inspired me to reach out to my old friend because it's never too late to be friends. I hope the new Smosh carries on for a long time
Anthony is now soy, Ian is a broken man. Yet somehow the comedy remains unchanged. How do you do it?
2023 battle? i miss thosee
I was in the second grade when I watched my first smosh video. In ways I’m still unaware of, you guys’d your creativity, and your humor shaped me as a person a lot. Watching you guys connect again and start making videos makes me miss my time doing the same with my friends. Thank you.
Boring videos
Checkpoint 3:56 lol
I love how even though you can tell Ian loves Anthony, you can also see that Ian would absolutely punch Anthony if given the chance without repercussion.
I first saw you guys because my cousin showed me the Pokémon revenge music video and I’ve enjoyed you stuff since then
I’m not even 4 mins in and I’m already wanting to sob. Lol I remember Smosh was one of the first I subscribed to. I remember coming on YT to look at the top Ytubers at that time. I swear it always had Smosh and NigaHiga in the list. YT has changed so much since then, it’s wild. 🫠 I also tried real hard to continue to watch Smosh once Anthony was no longer a part of it. Just because of Ian, some of my favorites to watch back in the day were “Ian is bored.” I honestly always felt just so sad about the 2 of them being apart. I couldn’t get into it.. so happy to see these two together, talking about all the things, and hugging it out. 🥹 🫶🏼
I used to watch Smosh as a kid with my sister and my dad, he would put on the Spanish version of it and we would laugh non stop it was amazing
Omg- this is so exciting I never thought in my life they will get back LIKE AHHHHHHHH
This was weirdly healing to my innner preteen ♡
While recognizing your understandable intention of not being a Nintendo-Esque brand by capitalizing primarily on nostalgia, I humbly request that when deliberating on which nostalgia-nugget to incorporate in future project(s), that Teleporting Fat Guy is prioritized as a possible contender.
I need a tattoo tour from Anthony because they interest me so much.      But this video is amazing.    So happy for y’all
good
i like it
I never knew how much I would like them getting back together and owning Smosh. I care way more than I thought :)
I have spent a long portion of my childhood watching these two. Im so glad i did. Watching these two in their journey is so inspiring, i like Ian but I relate so much with Anthony.
Oims umd pampers tsamts gutal
Can the next episode be with Ian's mom?
anthony is so much more well spoken than ian is, it's crazy xd
I think there should be an “I spent a day with OgSog”.
I know smosh when I was in my university days. It's a shock to know how many kids also watch it. I'm asian, and I was like, is this what western kids watch? So I was actually enjoying a kid's channel all this time? XD I was so confused, but nvm it's funny as hell so I kept watching it. Now it's been more than 10years, smosh is back so I started watching smosh again, still laugh at the old videos 10 years ago and also your latest videos. Guess I(my sense of humor) never grow up tho I'm at my thirties.   This is also a great smosh video. Have fun Anthony and Ian, just know that when you have fun, we have fun too 😂
Time flys
This is the most heartwarming thing ever. Two dudes who have been through so much together, grew apart, and are now ready to reconnect. It's so awesome.
hoping theres a day with the smosh cast and have on all the old members
Yea my favorite Cyberspace Celebrities!!
weh weh
Love you two guys fr. I used to watch you guys all the time and I’m really glad you both own Smosh! Brings back memories of just dying of laughter, especially the mail episodes haha
This is the best thing I've seen in a while
"We never even express emotions together so this is great." "I still won't." 😂
this is the best thing that had happened in 2023 for me, i miss yall so much, i rmb watching u guys almost everyday and rewatching all the old vids after school. I just recently revisit Smosh just to watch the old videos while reminiscing the past memories. Tbh this just feels unreal.
Rhett and link, I want to thank you for keeping smosh for us. You guys are heroes!
I'm 25 and I thought smosh was a fever dream. GMM AND SMOSH????????,????? Okey  :3
Youtube and Twitch relying on nostalgia to claw back people. The company is still there, it's just Google now.
Two bros,chilling in their chairs,1 feet apart cause they're best friends
Anthony looks like a 2000’s indie rock star and Ian looks like a 1970’s porno director… and I’m pretty sure it’s the best they’ve ever looked.
It’s an old joke to say that Anthony is more attractive than Ian, but I’m watching this and Ian is extremely handsome, they both are. I don’t think it happens much anymore, but they are both beautiful inside and out. ❤
Childhood coming back to me
I support Smosh so much!
Just realised I wasn't subscribed... woops!
Still a huge fan of OG smosh, but its true, my generation who grew up on OG Smosh is ready for a more grown up, relevant to the time, version of smosh, with the original two comedians.
A few parts were oversimplified. But you know they are being honest. They don't have to post things they think makes them feel some kinda way, angry or sentimental, whatever. It's good to see these back brother together. We need more movies tho. Bring stone cold back....
Omg this is like a behind the scenes of a Adult Smosh video
2:19 “Your dad was a secret cam model before it was cool”
Well this was sweet! ....ahhh and Ian's final statement!
This is less of an interview, but more of two friends finally passing the final milestone in repairing their friendship. A truly beautiful moment...
It feels like they’ve only kind of worked it all out. Keep talking boys, and remember your friendship.
I'm excited!!
This is gonna sound weird but hear me out. This interview kinda made me “get” their older videos. Guess it took me long enough XD
I think you’re a true creator Anthony. No wonder you couldn’t stay. Nor should you have. I’m your guys’ age and watched you in HS. I’d have never watched what smosh became. But I followed your new YT channel which is also great. I wonder if you’d have been a creator no matter what circumstance changed in the past. You’d have created something.
I guess more than just a day.
For the New Smosh Movie Brandon Urie plays Anthony
Anthony is so hot when he got teary eyed . I felt like I went thru therapy too watxhing this episode
Cant believe these two are back
This is one of the best friendship journey I have ever heard in my life ❤
Now Ian just needs therapy and it’ll all click lol
I’m so excited this made my heart pound this feels great
Wow this is a conversation I needed for my own personal experiences I feel. I wish I could have this conversation with people I miss and lost communication. Awesome friendship I’m glad y’all are back I love you guys ❤
Reunited
This had me tear up, so happy for you two! <3
well, back to the fanfiction :3
As someone who saw you 15 years ago and enjoyed your chemistry on camera for so long, my teen self is full of nostalgia, but my adult self is so proud of you guys talking about your issues, not only to your best friend but in front of millions of people, it’s truly inspiring, I booked my therapy session after this and have a new outlook on my long term friendships from childhood, thank you for that ❤️‍🩹
It's crazy that Ian's the more mature one now😂😂😂😂
i really dislike the tatoos. i can not watch the new smosh videos because this triggers me so much every time i see those lines on the hands and neck. i want the old Anthony back!
Smosh creativity turned into 💩 after anthony left and the views weren't high in comparison to the subs. So yeah, this needed to happen 😂. I love old smosh and am glad everyones back together.
Dawg you need to spend a day with power rangers
This is a cannon event 🤗 we all been waiting for 😁😁😁😁
This looked very therapeutic for you both. From seeing you guys from the beginning, this was incredible to witness.
Food battle 2023???
you gotta get the vannoss crew in here
Hello Cyberspace celebrities
Yo Anthony, did you every miss Ian during the separation?
the growth & synergy between you both as not only individuals but friends is not only genuine, it’s commendably rare. can’t wait to see more content & creative capabilities you both have to offer to the YouTube community.   It reminds me of the saying “ if you want to go somewhere fast , go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”
The way we’ve been waiting for this moment but yet we all had the feeling it would never happen😭
As a definite child when smosh the movie was coming out and watching the old smosh era videos, it most definitely was like live action cartoons
FoodBattle?
wheres anthony
20:10
After watching the Ian reads Anthony's journal video and then coming back to this, it's kind of insane to learn that Anthony pretty much was Smosh and Ian was there as talent and as a very public loud figure but neither of them couldn't do it by themselves
I can't really understand what Ian really go through but he seems changed. Like in a great way. He seems colder but stronger. I just want to see this duo and Smosh crew happy honestly.
Man I wanna see a food battle but if they don't want to i wont cry(in public)
Happy to subscribe to the most OG channel on YouTube
The emotional intelligence of these two is incredible   Edit: NOT THE MILK FANFIC
EPIC
Please do I spent a day with stampylonghead!!
Is this New smosh is bored vid?
this is fucking epic
Thank God for getting you guys back together! Watching your stories inspires me and helps me through a difficult time mentally, thank you and best wishes to both of you.🥰
The relationship between the two of you is the most romantic partnership I have ever seen.😭 And it really inspired us.🥰
You guys inspired me to be creative along with my long time best friend for many years of sketch comedy. And I want to thank you for that.
"Two bros chilling in a hot tub, 5 feet apart cause their not gay".
From an OG smosh fan: so glad you guys are back ❤❤   “If we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do that with you” 🥹🥹
Guys,WE NEED AN EPISODE WITH CORYXKENSHIN NEXT
WE NEEEED A VIDEO WITH CORYXKENSHIN
This is the best thing to ever happen. Can’t say how much I missed smosh and I’m so excited to see what happens next!!
These guys are funny they should make YouTube videos together
I never watched Smosh. I found Anthony's work years ago, and dude you are one of, if not THE BEST interviewers I've ever seen.
This interview helped me understand a lot of my insecurities with my relationships and has been helping me be more positive and understand things that are more important for me and the other individual whether it be my romantic relationship or friendships and I’m grateful that Ian and Anthony got to have this moment
You guys might not want to do it and might never do it. I would love some continuations to some old series' only if you find it fun and not a kill on your flow and feelings on the new smosh
It's like my divorced parents got back together
Smosh is what made YouTube get popular
love them sm omg 😭😭
I get a strange vibe from this video. It feels very….. forced? Idk. Doesn’t feel 100%. Maybe one it will one day. Happy to see this regardless
This dude making a killing off people
I love Ian and Anthony. I love Rhett and Link. I still think the haunted easy bake oven shaped me and I also still celebrate Ian's birthday every November 30th. This is beautiful.
Been there since at least box man has a girlfriend. Maybe even the MK video.. dont remember
'I spent a day with somebody with dyslexia.'
Change the hair back
To see how far both of you have grown is incredible. I have so much love for you both, OG Smosh was an amazing escape from school and it was like my two best friends just F•ing about. Truly, it’s so great to hear you two just go head to head and squash any beef.
We need a @F1nnst5rLIVE interview but really
Man, not the assassin's creed outfit
I love that you guys are back together again and finally own your channel together as it should be. I love how you guys are on the same team if we burn it down we’ll do it together. This was a very eye opening episode seeing a lot of the behind senses.
Can't wait for (hopefully) Smosh winter amd summer games, those were my favourite!!!
That was so wholesome, brave, mature, silly, awesome, thruthful. I'm so proud of both of you.  Ian, you managed Smosh so well on your own over those years, you followed your own heart and I'm so proud of you!   Anthony, I'm so proud of you for staying truthful to yourself and followig your heart and finding your own voice and place under the sun (and did that damn well!)  Thank you both for showing to the world that it is ok to follow your heart even though it means some hard sacrifices.  Wherever you go, whatever you do, together and/or seperately, I'm proud of you and love you!  ❤ -OG fan from 20010ish 😊
Honestly, think about how strong both of these people are. Not only did they have this hard talk, and go through all these things together, They did it all separately too. And after they did it all? They still had to go ahead and edit every moment of this video, and they are reminded of every thought they had during this interview every moment. Uncomfortable or Happy.
Y’all need to get Oishi high school battle can be back?
estos dos estaban adelantados a su época
I like video
Best friend breakups are the worst.
You should do an interview with chef YouTuber like Babish or Nick
Ill say it, 70% of modern smosh isnt funny
Ian is very intelligent and thoughtful,he has grown into the role of the leader. They have both matured so much as people The old Ian struggled with lines,while anthony struggled with being comfortable on camera. Now anthony is comfortable and composed doing interviews and being entertaining while ian doing a lot more things and bring smosh to how theyre doing now
You spent 15 years with Ian... I think.
I could listen to men like this talk about their deep genuine feelings all day
What thing has hapenned with Anthony? He has Lot of tattoes as lines hehehe
You should invite too turnt Tony 🤣🤣
We’re getting fan fictions again then? LMAOOO
Mail time and meal time w/ smosh was always my favorite.
Cyber space celebrates, lmao not the early 2000’s news clips 😂
I'm really glad you guys got together to create this. There's some great insight from both of you and I think this was necessary moving forward. Thanks for the information.
1:01:38 … so you’re saying we *aren’t* getting “if movies were real” again?
so happy to see two together again!
I didn’t even grow up with the original Smosh videos, and even I know this is one of the most important moments in YouTube history. Bottom line, they both got their best friend back, and the fantastic brand they’ve both created. Ian and Anthony, love you both💙💙💙
‘Ian hecox’ like you guy aren’t still best friends lol wtf
You guys are literally my childhood. I am so happy this day came
Day one of asking anthony to spend a day with the boys(e.g. juicy mully eddie josh and narrator)
Tôi rất thích thương hiệu này
Ian is me in any emotional conversation lmao someone I love starts tearing up with me and I'm like hm, oh, *nods*, *grunts in agreement*
PLEASE INTERVIEW JENNA MARBLES, you’re the only one who has a chance to get our queen back 😢 let her know old YouTube is backkkkk, we miss her so much. Even just to see her on here would bring the world so much needed joy.
Every other version of Anthony’s videos is him interviewing. This is him having a talk with a good friend. That is beautiful to watch
It feels like Anthony has grown a lot, but Ian has not so much. I hope this all turns out well.
These guys need to colab with smosh
Hi, so I know this is very stupid, and you will probably never see this, and I know my opinion doesn't matter. But I think you should do a video about OCD, Dyslexia, ADHD/ADD, or even children with mental disorders. I am someone who is the best about telling people about my mental health problems, but I find that I am very good at expressing it through my writing. Even though I am so young, I have had some pretty bad thoughts, and I would really appreciate it if you made a video about some of those things to help raise awareness. I hope you get to see this. Sorry if this is really stupid. Also I would just love to thank you for all these amazing videos and just raising awareness. You always make my day, and I always look forward to your videos.❤
Lo mejor:")... espere mucho este video
you should spend a day with BENOFTHEWEEK
If I don’t see a new food wars ima be hurt
What's sad But awesome at the same time is that before Anthony's channel became all "I spent a day with" I was having so much fun watching his new stuff. I thought it was great. And hearing them talk about the noise surrounding them during the time is difficult to understand
VIDEO IDEA: I spent a day with ex prison guards!
Ha gaaaay
How has toast not gotten an episode
This guy Cox
This was a great conversation and I’m so happy y’all are back together! I’m less happy that you mentioned the milk fanfic that I’d never heard of but have now read 😂
Maybe a relationship is like a fan. If you try to disassemble it you might break it, but if you are too afraid to do that there will be a lot of dust in the fan and the fan stops working eventually. I think it sounds like Ian and Anthony were too afraid to touch the fan because their business depends on it. Now they themselves and their business are both more stable, so they can finally clean the fan. So they said it right, all these have to happen, because the otherwise the fan won't get cleaned.
Do an episode with people w/ Alice in Wonderland syndrome. I'm think I might have it and would love an in depth look into it
I've been watching smosh since the beginning I'm so happy you guys own your brand again can't wait for more smosh content!!! Congratulations!!!!
Hallelujah thank you King Jesus for bringing us these two loved friends, reuniting them and bringing the greatest channel in the history of YouTube back!! 😊🙏🏻
It makes me happy not only seeing them together again, but then saying how not only them and the Amish crew can help make it better, but also us as the audience can contribute to helping smosh grow via attention, membership etc
And now if Jenna Marbles comes back, youtube will be healed
I'm coming here just to comment how abandoned the internet was whej smash died
I remember in 2012 I was 4 and seeing there death note episode as like the first thing i saw of them and falling in love with the show and then grew to different things and time to time remembering and now its return is amazing to me and i cant wait
Hey Anthony great video like always, I had a request for a video, could you reach out to some Iranians because they are going thro a lot of trauma,lots and lots of depression and I would 100% watch it if you could do a video like it
That sharp "I still won't" felt so judgmental and hurtful.
I feel like Anthony is giving himself in this interview, but Ian is still holding back. You can feel it in the air.
0:35 damn GYAT
I hope your still gna spend the day with 😢
I thought it was funny when they were talking about Smosh the Movie because I remember bootlegging it when it first came out 😂
Finally my two dads are getting back together
im not crying, you are crying....
Anthony, will you please invest in a new microphone for your videos? Your currents one causes little squeaks, and a very short metallic scraping sound for like .2 seconds. It is very distracting
I’m so glad to see you two back together I didn’t think this was gonna be a possibility at all. Gosh the nostalgia of watching classic Amish before and after school always made my the start of my day and end of my day so much better
to everyone saying that Ian was emotionally distant in this video: i really don't think he was. As someone who is uncomfortable showing emotions (let alone on camera) i know how hard it is to even just talk about these things. And you can see in the way he talks about their friendship that he's clearly spent a lot of time reflecting on it, and it shows great emotional intelligence. Not everyone wants to be completely vulnerable on camera for millions of people to see, and that's fine.
What a great video, so real and raw. I’m really happy you guys rekindled your friendship and still have the same creative minds after so many years, it’s amazing, best of luck on this new chapter!
Its funny cuz i was 13 when i watched the first smosh video, and istg the comedy level of Ian and Anthony has never changed, even now it feels like nothing has changed
This is nice.
Feels like a blast from the past. I was here when Smosh was huge and Ian and Anthony's humour wasn't my taste, granted, but I respected it. There was also a lot of things going on like TheStation and various things like that. It's been so long... Wow has YouTube grown. I even tried to post fun gaming videos but just could not find the motivation for mental health reasons. It was such a cataclysm of emotions and as much as a part of me hates to say it, I don't think I'd have it any other way.  Welcome back, past. Meet your future.
I loved Smosh as a teenager on the early YouTube days, and i went to college and eventually looked up the channel and i was honestly so heartbroken to see such a huge change.  😭 it really warms my heart; to see you two actually genuinely becoming friends again and being willing to fill us in and also that you both want to bring smosh back to it's original glory ❤
I wonder what would happen if Rhett and Link don't help Smosh last time! Anyway, both GMM and Smosh are based fromva childhood friendship. Which is amazing! Butt i always amazed how GMM can stay strong, maybe R&L are just good at managing business as they started it more 'experienced' adult compared to smosh. Either way both are just great, and I followed both since 2009 ish. Wish all the best for them
I totally respected Anthony leaving smosh and trying to make his own thing.
?
So Anthony has spent 5 and a half months with random people and his best friend
Anthony... almost crying... as reminisces and remembers the feeling of finally having that feeling of having fun with childhood best friend... and showing pictures of him and Ian when they were younger... sent me!
cool.  now time for Food Battle 2023
Look I’ll sit here and say the Smosh movie wasn’t amazing. But goddamn if it wasn’t fun to watch!
I love seeing the dynamics between them. Ian's dry humor contrasts well with Anthony's silliness, and you can tell how comfortable they are with each other.
1:53 I always dreamed of meeting a friend like that! Prob not gonna happen now.
Seeing Smosh coming back feels unreal. I loved those taste test videos and hoping to see it make a comeback. It’s great seeing them talk again!
I will say I am extremely happy and exited for new smosh but I have 1 questsion with this will the I Spent A Day With series still continue?
Anthony almost crying twice GOTDAMM almost got me twice while doing my makeup 😤😭💐💐💐
To bad the smosh channel died 15yrs ago 😂 good that Anthony and Ian are back with what they started all those years ago though
This is so informative its amazing
Imagine saying SMOSH is not advertiser-friendly. WTF has YouTube turned into...
I always knew Anthony would return one day. I have been hoping for six years that he would make his big comeback. Here we are. Fellow Youtube user unite. A veteran has returned.
Really cool to  see and here it. Times changes, now Ian got the Best haircut
God, I’m so happy for them! And I never would’ve guessed that our childhood/teenage years are coming back to us in 2023! ❤
i didn't realize how much i missed hearing both of their laughs in one room
19:21 ians laugh was so extremely awkward 😭
Oh how the mighty have aged
As much as we see Ian being happy that they own Smosh again, we can also see the pain that Anthony brought to Ian when he left smosh, and it's not as if It's Anthony's fault or Ian's, maybe it still hurts. There's some tone in his voice
Will Anthony still upload interviews? Because I live for his interviews 😭😭
Ain’t that the smoosh guy?
I'm beginning to understand why I like Anthony so much. He knows what people are thinking before they're thinking it unintentionally and listens between the sentences for intent. A man after mine own heart.
We need a new boxman video idc whatever I just want it
FINALLY
Is like Steve Jobs, when return to Apple :))))
So what will happen to this channel?
I’m really glad they’re back! And I’m also glad that I don’t know much nor read about the Milk Fanfic (all I know is that it’s a shock fanfic). Lol
Wow from 6th grade wish i have friends like that long
Hi Anthony! You should spend a day with people who have insomnia. I know you spent a day with people who have narcolepsy but it would be interesting to see how insomniacs survive with little to no sleep.
Selling to Defy Media was a bad business decision, you guys would have been better off just hiring employees to outsource some of the more boring work like editing. That's what MrBeast did and look where he is today.  You had the ideas but were not business savy enough, that was the problem.
have an interview with the group chat    :)
I feel like I just watched a movie. A genuinely wild ride
I HAVE NEVER READ THE MILK FANFIC…can someone give me the name? (For science purposes)
Anthony: "I think I'm gonna cry a little bit" Camera guy: "I gotchu bro" *zooms in* :D
my friends brother showed us going to the mountains when we were 8. needless to say I'm part retarded love you guys
Anthony has professional drummer energy and I mean that in the best way
This was beautiful 😢.
What ian said about being able to let go of things and letting them come back around if they do is something ive needed to hear for a while now, thanks the boys
ians leaving his job was a cannon event
I have to comment in support and excitement as a fan from the beginning. So happy to see you two working together again and hearing about whats been happening behind the scenes
so lunchtime with smosh will be back or somethin???????
What if those whole thing was a comedy sketch but just 7 years long ?
👍
this space of openness was so beautiful & your story is far from over. thank you to everyone involved in reconnecting these friends & bringing their visions to life. & of course every day won't be perfect, but i hope they continue to be brave & honest with their feelings. wishing you guys all the best!
Can you PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE interview Conan gray???
NOT THE MILK FIC
So amazing and heartwarming to see this I have such great memories attached to their videos
I cried for the entire duration of this interview
I am still in shock seeing smosh back together again. Smosh inspired my friend and I to make a YouTube channel when and also start making comedy skits because they helped a through a lot of hard times as kids and made us laugh. So thank you smosh for inspiring the next generation of creators!
Me and my brother started watching smosh in 2011 i love yall
THE LEGENDARY DUO IS BACK AGAIN!!!!!
This feels like a talk you have with your hest frien at 3 a.m
Hearing how the initial business meeting went warmed my heart. I was curious the story behind it and said in my head “any fan of Smosh would find a good deal and not play hardball”, and knowing that they wanted to first talk about the excitement and business stuff after made me so happy.  You can tell they were fans, and it’s nice to see fans who have the power are willing to make it work for the sake of bringing back what they loved originally. Beautiful! And wish it wasn’t so rare in the business 💜👏🏻
You guys are both cool. Congratulations on the Smosh-thingies. And good luck to the future.  ❤.
Is this back flip microphone guy?
They sat down and discussed buying Smosh. You could say the businessmen sat down.
Hey I've got an idea if you haven't done this already: What I think would make a great "I spent a day with" episode would be "I spent a day with lucid dreamers." I think It'd be great to see as lucid dreaming is a relatively small subject and someone like you probably could spread the subject really far and wide. I think if you do choose to do this idea I'd suggest trying to get in contact with @Tipharot and @Lucid Dream Portal because these are some of the biggest truthful lucid dreamers and (in my opinion) the best Lucid Dreaming channels.
Seeing Ian and Anthony doing Smosh together again makes my heart happy.
Can you interview people with a stutter btw I have a stutter
Nice
yoooo no fucking way ive actually deadass thought of what happened to yalls suit/costumes for yalls vids
As a Smosh fan, this really felt like a healing process for both Ian and Anthony, and also for the fans. There was so much going on behind the scenes that we didn’t know. But truly at the end of the day, I want to say thank you for everything you guys have done for us.
Can you do „I spent a day with communists“ I think it‘s important to hear what they have to say in the free market place of ideas
its a cannon event
Will these videos still be Happening? I love these videos and even if there are less of them due to the split focus on smosh I’d be sad to see them go
Hm
I miss the 🥣cut 😅 😂 💭
do i spent a day with ray william johnson
1:11:36 if we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do that with you ASDFGHJK 😭😭 my heart ❤️
What two absolute daddies !!!!!!! That was the most sexy, vulnerable, grown man shit I have ever watched.
Wasn't it feel great to grow and become more wise and mature? It feels like you're almost flying ~and the freedom is all yours alone as you can see through  everything which the rest of others couldn't.  Anthony is one of those rare person that has very strong passion towards "feelings". We don't get to find these kind of person very often in our life , so please DO cherish these "rare" individuals while we got the chance.    In modern societies to find someone who still cry over relationship issues very easily like Anthony~? Close to impossible if you ask me.
Petition: Spend a day with Technodad :)
Really proud of you all,
The boys are back in town 😭😭😭 nerds and scene kids rejoice! For once we were lost, but now we have found Anthony
Nice
I love you both own you're IP again!
Congrats on getting smoosh back
“Do they even know what Smosh is?” Fuck I’m gonna cry.
love how every youtuber seems to have That One Fic you 'don't' talk about. I've never heard of this milk fic but the way Ian reacted to it has me thinking it's like dan and phil's hamster fic.
Can’t wait for the I spent a day with smosh cast and crew ❤
We're so old xdd
GOOD VIDEO IAN
IF WE BURN IT TO THE GROUND, I AM HAPPY TO DO THAT WITH YOU! anthony literally trying to hold back tears because ian said that straight from the heart.
Next video: I spent the day with atheists
I personally remember the movie coming out and really liked it
🥲❤️
so smosh was bought by the ogs? hell yeah!
Very proud of both of you! I watched Smosh from the beginning and fell out when you both separated. I understood people grow and change and theres a business aspect to it. I still listen to the old Smosh videos with songs like Boxman and Fanny pack all the time. I’m excited to see where you guys are headed and what the future holds for you both ❤
I love fresh, new material...but also Food Battle 2023 when?!?!?!?
this makes me incredibly happy
I'd fuckin kill for a movie of this story. In-depth POV's of Smosh's history through Ian and Anthony's eyes, kidna like a biographical drama film.  Like Social Network, or Steve Jobs.  Feels a lot like the stories or experiences they speak of would make for amazing things to put in a movie.
I feel like you should do an interview with weed tubers such as people like Goblin, Erick Kahn, dope as yola, etc.
sorry Ian, but I will be taking your shirt.
this gave me shivers
Love how this turn out. Hope for the best of you two. But I'm greedy. Hope that these great interviews can keep going.
I just realized that u where smosh
10:15 smosh the movie is one of my favourite movies ever
I just remembered, at the end of the video, that when Anthony announced he's leaving smosh, he said he would call Ian every day. So, I would comment under Anthony's videos if he had called Ian that day. I dont remember when I just forgot to do it anymore. But it's nice that things turned out this way cause the catharsis definitely sounded mandatory.
they friggin looted defy xD
I feel like Anthony leaving really gave them both a lot more individuality
Why is ian being like that???
It's actually really cool to see two fully grown men being emotionally vulnerable with each other and just talking about their issues as friends.
Can we have a I Spent the Day with Smosh OGs  Teleporting fat guy ??  Ians mom ?  Charlie the drunk guinea pig 😂
Does Anthony have a perm?
I know I’m late but I’d recommend trying to spend a day with any of the vanoss crew, they were my childhood and it’d be very cool to see ogs on the platform talk
I love you guys, as you said kids probably shouldn’t have been watching you but I was watching Smosh since I was 5 (2011) 😂 thanks for entertaining me throughout my childhood 💕
Let me start off by saying, I LOVE THIS WITH ALL MY HEART! I grew up watching you guys and was so happy by all the nostalgic videos, However when yall parted I knew you guys had to go through with what needed it to happen. I can say I knew you may or may not have reunited, yet I hoped and prayed for this opportunity to come back and say this was a meant to be thing, no matter what you all went through or the difficulties it bring. You guys are the original ultimate pair! I felt so warm hearted seeing this reunion and some how I saw it all in the right order after everything came out two weeks after. I really wanna thank you guys for all that you done yanno, You came from such a little idea and it made it so far and I'm proud to say I am an original fan who stuck around and hoped for this to happen until it did. You guys were a part of how I grew. I was a odd ball out and a black sheep of the family as well as never had many friends growing up, but you guys showed me how cool it was being the way I felt was normal... That I could be something instead of the weird nerd. Between all your videos and songs and growth. Yall were there until you weren't, but this was the comeback that I hoped for sense that time happened and I now as an adult like you (I think we are similar age) maybe a little tipsy writing this, but hey a little spicy water can go a long way. (not advised to youth!!! 21+ Only) But I again would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart I love yall both so much and if there ever came a day I could meet you guys I would love that day, but until then thanks for all you guys do , I really appreciate you and so does all your other fans! Love ya ~ Pandaabbie484
hsomS
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you" WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I CRIED MY EYES OUT
I subscribed to you Anthony because you’re a real one! I was an old school watcher, I watched og food battle 2006 when I was in middle school. My friend Kylie had a crush on you. I love how you’ve grown as a person, how much you bring to the table with your personality. Ian’s a great guy and I give him props keeping it alive, I watched some of the crew smosh videos, there’s a smosh family now, I see it and I’m down with it. All right all right closing- I remember when the only cast on Smosh was you, Ian and the food battle announcer. Of course Ian’s mom lol
42:03 ian turns into anthony lmao
next joe rogan
Public therapy session
eyo anthony can you bring back your old haircut?😁😅
I have been watching you guys since I was 7. I'm so glad u guys have done this collab after so long.
Fucking nice one! Chuffed to bits that things worked out for you guys (:
That's very sick. Enjoy man🎉
Anthony "we were never able to express emotion to eachother..." Ian "I still won't."😂😂😂
its so beautiful seeing so much growth between two individuals
Okok I just saw the oh minecrafters and wonder where was stampy and let’s go smosb is back baby
I admit that I haven't watched Smosh since around 2011, but man, this was very cathartic to watch. I didn't realize I still had this childhood connection to Smosh after all this time.
54:45 That laugh just cleared my skin, watered my crops, and set me free
you know I gotta give it up to Rhett and link for actually keeping the business alive by buying smosh when it was dying and now Anthony and Ian are back together is great ❤
You both bring me back to my high school days when I couldn’t wait till you posted the new episode.
LOL
I watched the smosh movie like 10 times when I was 11
This is bigger than the Jonas brother reuniting because we actually “know” these guys better, hits more close to home.
I'll miss the emo hair :0
This was such a delight to see you both have an earnest chat. I am SO excited to see what Smosh 2: The Shut Up-enning is gonna bring!
plsss get brett cooper on your episode next plsss!!!
Honestly one of the best (real life) redemption arcs ❤
We are healing in 2023 and onward
I’m so glad to see you guys back again. I grew up on Smosh videos. I know it won’t be the same, but I’ll definitely be watching Smosh again.
Two legends getting back together 🎉🎉🎉
I was one of those children who should not have been watching smosh.
24:28
I'm not crying, you're crying.
I'd Love to see you interview the vanoss crew, that'll be sick, theyve been on youtube for a while now
😊
Stoned guinea pig charlie!!!
Smosh was my childhood:D
Really proud of yallllllliiii
Tôi rất thích thương hiệu này
Legit question. Is Anthony gay?
Like ive said on several other of the new vids, you guys are the best comic duo i know of. just saw your new video and its so awesome. Do whatever you want...just do it together. And if you can get stevie back at some point, thats the icing.
DO JULIAN CASABLANCAS
wow this is ICONIC, Anthony and Ian are ICONIC! I remember that Pokemon video was the first video i saw on youtube. Smosh was so freaking amazing! I even replicated some of their videos with my friends for fun back then the Internet was just starting and never in a million years did i think youtube would be this Big now. Or else i would of continue making videos on youtube haahha.
B We'll be the best of friends
I watched the movie like last year and i loved it lol
some Naruto and Sasuke type shi
spend a day with kanye fans, those mfs are unhinged (im a kanye fan)
Which one is which @ 42:07?
Watching your videos as a kid became such a fond memory for me. I still vividly remember borrowing my dad's iPad and rewatching vids you guys made dying laughing! It feels great to see a little piece of my childhood return but, more importantly to see a great friendship that formed those videos restored!   Congrats guys! To new memories!
Los dos ya me causan gracia nomas de verlos juntos
57:32 Wow, Joshua Wolf Shenk's theory of innovation in creative partnerships in evidence! His argument is that the most successful duos have intense commonalities that inspire and excite each other, but also operate in different ways that end up completing each other and making great work possible; one such interaction is the "liquid" partner (pouring out creative ideas) and the "container" partner (catches and shapes and gives the best form to the ideas with intense focus); sounds like exactly what Anthony is describing of their dynamic
This reunion hits harder than when the Jonas Brothers got back together
Goodvideo
(Smosh becomes even bigger then their own food wars) *knocking on the door* (defy is back with open arms? *Ian & Anthony flip them off*
Its the comeback of youtube history. I dont think anyone so big for youtube, so integral to its early success, has EVER made a comeback like this. Not only has Smosh overcome countless trials and tribulations, but they sold out THEN made enough to come back BIG.  Yall were the first really successful youtube, and its come full circle. I cant wait to see what comes next.
I can't watch this right now you're gonna make me cry. 😭
Please tell me lunchtime with smosh returns too🥺
We love you guys. What a sweet couple really wholesome
This is like a really good story of two YouTube best friends/partners in business, fall apart and rise back up and triumph back together again as partners and this time owning their brand again. Its such a feel good story, I'd watch that movie 😭💯🫶🏽
when we gonna get the "I spent a day with ur mom"
Nostalgiaaaaa omfg
The best collab ever
You need to do a video on rare illnesses, conditions, and diseases. I have something called visual snow syndrome and I would love seeing someone else talk about their experiences with it because I've never met another person who's talked about thiers
Smosh was a huge part of my growing up: I remember thinking they had the perfect life, making content with your best friend living together and just getting to do whatever you wanted. Now I’m older I’m glad that they’ve sorted out their issues and can come together again, because they’re right, you change a lot in 10 years and things can collapse if they’re not handled right. I’m looking forward to this new era of this channel I once loved.
In a way this was really an Anthony Padilla episode
It’s a blessing that Rhett and Link are the ones that ended up owning smosh if some other corporation ended up owning them it’s highly unlikely they would of got it back. Shout out to them for being such cool dudes
This is proof that friends are your true soulmates. Welcome back dudes.
Is it just me or Anthony looks like a therapist when he sits with other people  (No Hate and welcome back to smash Anthony we all miss you)
1:18 woah woah woah, wtf is that the Transformers G1 Season 3 theme song??!?
When I first started watching Smosh, I was in the 5th grade. Now, I’ve graduated law school and am going to take the Bar soon. Absolutely crazy. I’m so excited
Proud of y’all!!!
I know this is out of nowhere but you should interview Technoblade's dad.
1:11:10 "And even if it doesn't do well, I know that this is the right thing. And if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you"   Even if the channel ends up dead with low views and low interaction in this era of YouTube, they still have their channel again and their friendship back. That's what matters the most.
This was pretty heartwarming ngl, you can tell they’re just having a man to man and talking out years of unsaid thoughts, and as guys, this only makes out bonds stronger, I hope you guys can rekindle that friendship from school, where it was you guy vs the world
I screamed so hard. Thank you for this vulnerable video. Here since day one ❤
They aged well iven Ian
I believe they aren't friends still, this was just a good investment for them both.
I think I speak for all of us when I say more food battle
It's heartbreaking to see the difference in emotion between these two and how they converse during the video. Since his seperation, Anthony had time to declog all the emotional resentment he had for the company and was finally able to do his own creative thing. This interview was likely the first time he was able to lift those weights off personally to Ian. And it's why he was able to cry at the thought of remembering their first lunch together, and how he realized that his childhood bestfriend was still there. In the meantime, Ian was left to manage this big company all by himself; he went through Anthony's seperation, Defy medias abrupt collapse, being adopted by Rhett and Link, the rewriting of Smosh's brand, managing a team of talented people, and handling criticism from the public. I couldn't imagine just how much emotional baggage Ian had to carry that he had to seek a therapist. And he mentioned getting therapy in this video like it wasn't a big deal. But it was a big deal. Because Ian learned how to compartamentalize all his issues, he likely dealt with the emotional trauma a long time ago. Which is why, despite discussing all the things he went through in Smosh and with Anthony, that he got so used to not expressing his emotions. And its why we see him talk somewhat slower and emotionally un-phased in this interview. It's the image of a person who went through so much but still wants to put a smile on our faces. Though Anthony went through his fair share of struggles, I feel like Ian doesn't get enough credit whenever people talk about Smosh. And I think that's where the fans had it wrong - that Smosh wouldn't survive with just Ian in the picture.
Hey I know your busy because smosh But if you have time can you spend a day with technoblade's dad
Is Anthony an actual therapist??
To think that Smosh is almost exactly the same age as me is literally fucking insane /pos
Aaah. SMOSH… ALMOST.
Can you please do a day, where you spend it with epileptic people?
I love you guys! Glad you’re back. Both of you!
Oh no... now I have to go read about the "Milk Thing".
Tbh i feel like this is a ticking bomb that's gonna explode at any moment. While to Ian this ,,reunion" is a business move, which will boost Smoshes success overall. He knows that thair ,,peak" era is over, and it will never be the same, Anthony is too emotional and clouded by nostalgia. This will end badly
SHUT UP!
Shedding childhood tears right now
the boys are back
My childhood is somewhat bad
51:43 I've not heard Anthony laugh like that in a long time.  It's different from his normal "interviewing a guest" laugh.
Man I bet the first subscriber to Smosh can get his way out of any situation
You can tell anthony has done a good amount of therapy when he goes "Because it was take-. *deep breath* to me it felt like it was taken"
Oh my gosh this is like The Beatles getting back together again.
FULL 👏 CIRCLE 👏
does someone might know where anthony got those shoes?
idk i see ian a little closed and anthony anxiously pushing
Nature is healing.  Anthony leaving Smosh was a cultural reset and it's wild seeing this happen in a span of a few years
Having a shroom trip together would’ve solved a lot of that tbh
You should do one of these with ww2 veterans
i've been a smosh fan for a really long time, and seeing these two reunite and finally have their old channel back the way it used to be is really beautiful to me. maybe it won't always be smooth sailing, _everyone_ has their ups and downs, but at least they've grown and now know that they have each other to fall back on. very happy for you two!
this is a legendary story!!!
This makes me so happy
Even the second weird hug felt like some old Smosh lol. After all these years with the interviews and meaningful stuff it's so weird to remember that Anthony used to just be hilarious on camera for a living
SMOSH IS BACK BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I stopped watching smosh years ago. It was a channel I loved dearly but I saw once the passion was gone and left myself. I’m glad they are back and I’m glad they are friends again. I’m happy for them and I’m excited to see what they do next.
The OG Amish fans still remember having to click the pause button at a certain point to see Anthony in SpongeBob underwear in the Pokémon video 😂
I’m way too excited for this! Absolutely worth the wait and them figuring themselves out! Also love how giddy Anthony can be with Ian again!
11:58 His laugh directly after "What friendship?" Made their friendship seem even more warm and loving, i rewound that part probably 7-8 times. You can sense the strength and stability of their bond in that moment and in the silly type of laugh more than any other moment I've ever seen between them, it feels like it's rooted int their childhood and has survived so completely
This video was great. The interview was great because I used to watch Smosh and it’s really opening to see the founders of Smosh do an interview with one another.   I feel like a good interview idea would be “I spent a day with people who dealt with second hand smoke” because people who go through second hand smoke do face difficulties as times.
they’ve been friends since 6th grade? wow!
Im sad for the parallel universe where the timing wasnt perfect and this didnt work out 😢
I am a minute and 12 seconds in and I am already wondering who in the hell doesn’t know what Smosh is?!  Watching Amish with my brother is literally all of my core childhood memories
genuinely crying
Listening to this makes me completely understand why Aba and Preach remind their viewers that they are not friends. They don’t hang out like that, they have their own lives they mainly see eachother in that room they record in and that’s it
I love Ian and Anthony thank you for having these boys on this show
The real life Anthony and Ian are the opposites of the characters they play. In their videos Ian is the goofy one with a big heart and Anthony is the witty one. Irl their roles are reversed and I find it hilarious 😅
Anthony Padilla, what do you think of the Eric Andre Show?
I remember absolutley confounding a teacher at my school with Smosh and Harry Potter puppet pals. It was the last day where you don't do any work and watch films instead. We convinced him to let us watch youtube and he steadily got more and more confused as we requested food battles and seven year old does twilight and eventually he just exited from youtube. So glad Smosh is back!
I still get a feeling Ian has a resentment towards Anthony... I hope you guys get happier together.
I shed a tear.
ian headcack and anthony padildo together 🥺🥺🥺🥹
I’m fucking crying y’all own smosh 🥹😭😭
ian was my first utube crush :)
I saw that pewdiepie was taking time off from YouTube and was kinda sad but seeing that yall are coming back right after was a great feeling
Will the food battles come back???
I just want to thank you for this video. You didn’t have to do this publicly, but you did. I think this will help other folks in similar situations and it’s absolutely wonderful.
Feels good to hear "ROFL"
If a one direction reunion won’t happen at least we got a smosh reunion
we need an "i spent a day with sinjin drowning" please
when ian said  "if we burn it to the ground I'm happy to do that with you."😭😭 1:11:35  you're suppose to make us laugh cause you're the funny one😢
The OGs are back!
I remember the years leading up to Anthony leaving Smosh was getting cringe, but i am here for the whole thing if thats the worst that you all fear for
Growing up with Smosh, it sounds like they were coping just as we are currently or have already done. They deal with the same issues as us, yet, they faced problems before anyone else online and they received the most backlash because of the things going on. Thanks to Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla for both making my childhoods. They made it so well that they are some of the only celebrity names I will keep memorized lol
"If we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you."
waste tones of money on the freaking garbage. money cannot buy a tiny of happiness
This is great but .. does that mean he’s not also making i spent the day with __ anymore
Its crazy to think about how we wouldnt have smosh if that teacher never put them into a group project.
male  seggs
I would absolutely join the membership if I could afford to, anyone who can DO IT!
cooppurtunity * im adding this to my work vocabulary XD
You guys should do a reacting to old fan fiction like in the old days! would be so funny 😂
🧴💨"omg..this a better love story than twilight.."🧴💨   SHUTTT UPPPPPP!!!!!
Thank you for helping people understand what other people go though
well, u 2 just got reunited ?
Very good 👍
Are u guys friends now? PLEASE ANSWER ME I NEED TO KNOW
Bring Garret's full insurance back
This honestly felt like Smosh therapy sessions lol not in a bad way tho
my cat watched this with me and he started to attack the screen so I dont know if he approves but he also attacks me and he loves me so YAAAAYYY SMOSH!
How'd he become more emo?
smosh: the movie 2 when??????
This video was beautifully crafted. I bought the reunion T-shirt to show my support originally. Im ready to take the next step and become a member 🫡 Honestly. Really. This video was truly a masterpiece. Thankyou both and good luck!!!
woow this is so much stuff, i think nobody really knew what was really going on behind smosh. so happy to see smosh is back together
imagine a smosh episode but its based on  smosh  bts or something and they adapt their acting to align more with their out of character selves🎭😐👍
Thank you for you service Kings
I am so glad you two are partners in Smosh, again! I have stopped watching Smosh since few years ago, but I am willing to start again.
I don’t know if it’s related but Rhett and link have been more active on there main account the last couple months and I hope it was inspired from you guys getting back to your roots and just having fun with it again my favorite people are doing the things that inspired my personality at such a young age and now creating content for them,, I feel many pioneers of YouTube went through being unique then after that ran it’s course trying to adapt just to hear “i miss the old____” so just continuing the old stuff therefore stunting creativity and falling out of love with it, it’s almost like as an audience we had to grow up and now appreciate seeing new things!!!!!!! Love you guys so much, thank your for teaching me bad words in second grade!! Gave me street cred lol
this was so cathartic to listen too. i loved this podcast❤
Everyone talking ab Rhett and link (who is fire) but I want footage of that defy party
Ian looks like he has just lifted a huge weight off his back. I hope sharing the burden of ownership with Anthony again gives him some space for himself too.
And goodbye or not goodbye
And stop ruin 2023 please for whatever days weeks and months ok?
And you already disappoint me i thought that you are a normal youtuber but no
And it suck bro
34:43
I hate bad stuff such as bad youtubers and family guy ok?
its .like rett and link need to make you all a team again and friends again on and off cam
My literal Youtube name was originated from being a fan of Smosh when I was 12. Ian, I am so glad you kept Smosh afloat. I am so happy for you guys!
14:01
i miss the smosh mobile game omg nostalgia
Like they said: Full circle. First, it was lip-syncing. Then Smosh. Now, there's tiktok lip-syncing. Then, Smosh comes back.
i love how two friends are just having a normal conversation here
This was like a therapy session with how open they were
What is the milk fanfic????
So.. what will happened to this channel then? no more interviews?
Any other Beatles nerds out there seeing creative partnership parallels?
ROFL-ing 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I enjoyed the movie
Food battle 2023?
This made my heart smile!❤ I love how cool this is
Sometimes you understand that your heroes where two kids...
Smosh was my life when I was a middle schooler going through a really hard time. Thank you guys, glad to see you together once again
Lets talk about whats important here… GIVE The people new assasins creed, zelda, pokemon etc songs again😂 Happy for yall🎉
So nobody told me they had a movie
This felt really meaningful.
So if you think about it the teacher started smosh
This is so great! I’m so excited for y’all!! Missed you two together
Can I get a link to the milk fanfic? Asking for a friend.
its interesting to notice how different their dynamics emotionally are ... +the fact Ian was afraid the sketches would get too real or jokingly emotional hahahha
Grew up watching Smosh loved it and everything especially the food battles.
The OGs
I watched the easy bake oven and food battle 2011 last night
missu
I still can't wrap my head around that you guys bought back smosh TOGETHER. So happy for y'all!  Also, big props to Rhett and Link for keeping Smosh together until Ian and Anthony could repurchase it.
i love Ian’s glasses
Y’all are both hot and a decade ago child me thought u were BOTH cute and funny.
Wtf? You guys bought Smosh? So it's yours now again??? Man major W guys! Proud of y'all!
At 59:29 When Anthony said 'ok,' it sounded just like Link from GMM.
These two sitting here talking makes me realize, what I loved about my childhood isn't gone, it's just changed. And that makes me happy.
I'm so glad to see you guys together again. You were my FAVORITE channel when you were coming up. Mainly because I was seeing people I interpreted to be around my age (you're like 5 years older than me) goofing around.   I'm so looking forward to the future of Anthony and Ian's relationship as friends again and the future of this channel and the SMOSH channels.
12 year old me is LIVING
Now Joji has to go to coldones
@19:21 sums up Smosh in 2023.
this healed my inner child
this is like that time star_ broke into jerma985's house and they became friends again
wow. they really are the lennon-mccartney of absurd internet humor
This is such a cool conversation. I didn't know much about anything at the time (really only started watching Anthony's content a couple years ago) but my best friend was strongly team Anthony back when the split happened, and I think that's funny because Ian's strongly reminding me of him in this video. Also rad to hear this as a younger person with a longtime friend that I hope to keep in my life for even longer.
He's still emo, I think.  It's just evolved.  It shows through and I love it. 🖤   Also, congratulations Ian and Anthony!  We wish you two all the best and earnestly look forward to seeing you two continue to grow along with SMOSH. ❤❤      *SHUT UP!*
ugggg everything coming full circle. is youtube finally starting to heal? this made me cry honestly. my childhood and a big reason i wanted to start making videos. i wish i stuck to it. good to see the OGs reclaim the throne again.
They are such great listeners and they domonstrate such great respect for on another despite the past pain and resentment. What a great interview. Great news on coowning Smosh again. Kudos!
God its so nice to see my childhood youtubers just grown up and talking and showing what was going on behind the scenes meanwhile im grown up and just acting like i wasn't one of those 10 year olds that shouldn't have been watching said youtubers
This video is very good and amazing
I still dont feel like ive truley heard how ian felt during the whole time... Id love to hear more about his resentment/ views on what went down.
Wet_Memes.  That you?
This is the best
god I love this episode.
We summoned a demon was absolutely hilarious 😂
I haven't thought about the milk fanfic in close to 10 years. Why did they have to remind me. The story that scarred me at age 13. If you haven't read it and am wondering what I'm talking about, do yourself a favour and don't look for it. You'll sleep a lot better
Ngl the sketch was very mediocre, I remember the old smosh videos when your ( Anthony ) character used to contradict with Ian which created conflict and was funny to see,now in the new sketch you guys are agreeing to everything in a weird way which takes away the entertainment.
1:11:40 man that was so wholesome!
I liked smosh the movie I love that film so much
All I want is for Anthony and Ian to rekindle their relationship, it is worth much more than a YouTube channel. They don’t owe us anything!
My biggest fear is that this reminds me of the Drake & Josh situation. I hope that doesn't happen to Anthony and Ia. I and probably everyone else wants them to stay friends.
So this was free, then for members only then free again?
Im glad they had Rhett and Link who are amazing people after being business minded
This was incredibly heartwarming and AAAAA I can’t stop smiling!!! It feels like that one scene in ‘Your name’ where the grandmother explains ‘musubi’. How it can tangle and change, split apart completely but it will always come back together. 🥲🫶🏽 So happy for you guys!! 🎉🤗🎉 So excited too!!!
Spend a day with The Grudge
nice
Rhett and Link just up'd their street cred big time
can we just see one food battle tho please she to funny that new skit was funny asf
aye bruh business is business fr
Anthony, I gotta say… as a person who is behind. If I saw you, I would talk to you about the interviews because that’s when I discovered you. I had to look up what Smosh was at the beginning of this video.    That being said, there is legit nothing more beautiful than adults reconciling.  This video is wonderful.
I'm a veteran viewer of Smosh. (since my old YT account) I saw it BECOMING big and I loved you guys because I had the same BFF as you two were. What struck me was that you split up while my friend and me split up. After I saw that Anthony left, after a months of hoping for his return - I have ultimately unsubscribed Smosh with immense sadness of how personal it was to me. I have joined Anthony's channel where there's much less humor but I was happy that in-between, Anthony is still the same Anthony, joking around, FREELY.  I'm happy that you've reunited. You're truly the ones as bestest bros. Together you're complete. Keep it this way.
I found the milk fanfic. I laughed for 2 hours.
"If we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you" This made me tear jerk. I missed the fucking duo
This is such a great conversation / catch up. Keep up the great work! Awesome legendary comeback!
Titulo alternativo: Pasando el tiempo con Ian Hecox despues de 7 años
20:09
😢
I doubt you will see this comment Anthony but, I’ve been watch this channel only for a few weeks now mainly because your guests are are extremely interesting and you are so genuine with them. As much as I’ve heard of Smosh and seen clips or other youtubers reference it I didn’t know you were one of the duo so, in my mind at least you’ve definitely proven you have your own identity away from Smosh. Further to that it was nice to see the raw, emotional conversation between best friends/business partners especially as I run/co-own a video production company with my best mate and definitely get what you guys must have gone through. Love working with my friend but don’t like putting pressure on our relationship. Good luck with rekindling the venture of Smosh 2.0 hope it works out for you both and keep up the fantastic work on this channel 👍
I'm actually starting to tear up as this video winds to a close and the full weight of this all is hitting me. I'm so happy for you guys. I'm looking forward to this new generation of Smosh!
ANTHONY YOU SHOULD SPEND A DAY WITH HOUSTON JONES
so rhett and link started doing their own original sketch comedy again probably influenced by your guys's choice!
42:02 there is something in my eye :(((
Teleporting fat guy will always hold a special place in my heart ♥️
You guys should make a video of you guys writing a video. Seems like it could be great
I personally loved the smoosh movie. I will say I haven’t revisited it as an adult 😂
Had to do something to get those views up huh
God, I'm 30 now and this is the Smosh I missed you two together.
nice
Had to stop everything to watch, this is legit internet history. Super interesting
I really like Anthony's Tatoos, Real Sick Looking Man
i would love a movie about the conflict u guys had as a business partner/ best friends
There’s something cathartic about this that I didn’t know I needed
Been watching guys since I was 12 🫶🏼💓 now I’m 23. Love you guys !!!
If Anthony is back with Ian, wht about this Channel is he gonna keep making more I spend the day with or will he stop? That’s my only question.
Anthony padilldo
Yeah I will probably regret but I kinda want to know what this milk fanfic is about
I love how open they are in their talking to each other in this video
dad and Dad are back together 😀
Can we get a ian "like" counter
32:30 hearin anthony say "so we fuckin own smosh now" was litterally amazing like i never thought id hear thoes words
It brings me joy to see mom and dad getting back together
As awesome as it is to have classic smosh back, I do hope this doesn’t mean the I Spent A Day With series is going away. I understand if it does since it would be more work on Anthony's part, but there's been so many good videos that came out of the series, it would be a shame if we lost that
This is just couple's therapy 😭
amazing
I love Anthony so much❤
This video unruined half my childhood
I LOVED THE MOVIE!
Wao wonderful and amazing information video I really like it...
It's so amazing to see you guys back together again! You guys were a huge part of my childhood and I loved the new video. Hope you all are having a blast, that's what's most important
Now Spend A Day With Aron Ralston
Internet history happening before our very eyes
Yes, they've read your cringey teenage fanfictions, people.
Ian dosent get enough credit
Can anybody explain about the milk fanfiction?😂
these two are platonic soulmates. they just fit together. so glad to see them rekindle their relationship.
This fills my heart with so much joy! Words can't even explain.
I don’t understand what Ian is talking about honestly Anthony’s early sketch videos were hilarious in my opinion especially starting with like cocktober and stuff it was gas
anthony you should do a video where we spend a day with you and ask you questions in the form of comments or tweets in the same format all of your interviews have been
you guys are men for releasing this. Super real vid. Grew up on Smosh as a kid and it played a role in developing my sense of humor, as countless other kids. Thrilled to see you guys can possibly make some quality adult comedy now
I was 6 years old when I started to watch smosh now I’m 15
slay i started watching smosh when i was 8 (i just turned 25), it was my favorite youtube chanel always, so glad to see you guys back together and in control again. I have loved growing with you guys and watching yall grow up too <33
Anthony, please make an interview with surrogates!✋️✋️✋️
I'm excited for this and I'm excited for you two. The emotion and nostalgia y'all will bring back is incredible, and that line Ian said at the end really sold the point. Even if this doesn't work out there is no other person to go down with than your homie
If my name isnt micheal jackson, im wondering who's the gay one out of the two of them
Cyberspace celebrities lmao
Vamos 😢
Random memory that came to mind(iykyk): "...I told you I could do the helicopter..."
Seeing SMOSH reunited again is the most nostalgic and beatiful thing I've seen in a long time. Means a whole lot for me. ❤ First Videos ever seen on Youtube!
What was the fanfiction he was talking about
Two broooos chillin in a dark room 5 feet apart cuz their NOT gay!!😂😂
Do face blindness - Prosopagnosia next plssss
thr tear in 42:50 !!!! THE TEAR!!!
Now you are back together u need to do 2 bros chilling in a hot tub 2023
Well. Anthony very really. He bought.
Anthony saved his primary thing. I appreciate that.
When Anthony is the PARENT. Woo. Let it BE.
I don’t understand why. Ian…
I played their game. OG remember
who the hell is ian hecox?
It's kinda sad to know that some of our favorite moments as fans could have been so miserable for you guys. I'm glad you are out of it now tho!❤
its so nice to see them together again and having such an adult conversation ❤
I am so glad I stayed subscribed to smosh. I knew they would come back🫶🏾
Rhett and Link, the dads of YouTube.
Anthony Padilla where do you wear earrings and you look gay
the duo ever
It’s sad to hear that the speculations that they weren’t friends and on good terms were true. But I’m happy they’re back together.
and they were roommates
Can you spend a day with Tim Cookor Sundar Pichai? I would love to see that
WHAT DO U MEAN U OWN SMOSH AGAIN? OMG
You and Ian were two of my biggest inspirations growing up.   I loved watching your sketches, my favorites were the Pokémon ones and molester moon lol. You inspired me to make youtube content. In the future I want to make my comedy like you guys. I hope yous are always remembered for doing what you love and thank you for making such an impact on me and others
What time in rhe video did this happen at?
It still feels a little awkward between them. I don’t mean this in an accusatory way. Obviously after so much tension over the years it’s going to be there. But I think they haven’t quite moved past some things, and it’s honestly really nice to see that. It’s realistic. I appreciate their honesty, and I’m excited to see how you two and smosh grow. ❤️
This feels like sitting down to catch up with old friends…💖
Food Battle thought me English when no one else could
This is very unexpected, also a huge coincidence. I very recently discovered your interview with Michael from VSauce, before I didn't even know you were still an influencer. A few days later and I see this, the reason I know you coming back, that's awesome!
Please please please please make Food Battle again 🙏
where food battles is what came up to my mind
Rhett and Link knew what they were doing :)
COMENTA AQUÍ ABAJO A QUIEN AÚN NO HA OLVIDADO A SU ES :V XD ❤ 😂 ❤LOS LEO❤
COMENTA AQUÍ ABAJO QUIEN NO HA OLVIDADO A SU EX :V XD 😂❤  ❤️Los Leo ❤
Dude i remember when watching food wars back then. It was like the funniest thing ive seen and at the time. My god i would give almost anything to go back
Just wanna thank the women in their lives. Bare minimum they saved a friendship. Anything extra is a huge blessing for the rest of us.
I stopped watching smosh because it got really stupid after Anthony left!  Happy you guys are back together!
I still sing “box man can’t get a girlfriend!” To myself TO THIS DAY. My friend and I were obsessed & even had our own “box man” in the silly videos we made. I’m almost 30 myself now. I love you guys so much and I’m excited for your next chapter🤍
My friends came to visit me in hospital and brought me gifts when I, similarly to Anthony, was dealing with an autoimmune disease. I’ll also remember the lengths they went to for me, for the rest of my life. True friends will come through 🤞
Big props to Anthony for keeping this completely up. Especially when Ian airs his grievances that puts Anthony in a bad light! I love Ian and Anthony and can't wait to see their new sketches!
i need to know what anthony considers the golden age of smosh 🥹
honestly i just want lunch with smosh back
I want to say this to both of you guys y’all are young y’all grew up in front of the camera don’t apologize for stepping away a little bit to find yourself I’m glad y’all were able to salvage a friendship that’s the most important part of all of it!!!!! Been here since the beginning my kids are now in their 20s and we watched y’all their whole childhood I’m glad the OG‘s are back!!!!!👍🏻🙏✊🛠💯☮️💕
I’ve been waiting YEARS for this. FINALLY
18:00 Pros and cons to talking to someone with the same situation as you. It's nice to be able to relate to someone else, but sometimes, even when you're going through the same things, you can still have different responses to it and sometimes people forget that others can experience things differently and don't understand why you'd respond to the situation like that.
OH MY GOD I THOUGHT THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN I QUIT WATCHING AFTER SMOSH GOT BAUGHT BY A COMPANY AND STOPPED BEING FUNNY.
Can we bring back Box Man? Where are they now? Family? Children? Just box cats? I would throw money for a box man figuring.
Who else got that sinister squidward add XDDDDD
So when’s the next foodbattle
Hearing them both talk so seriously reminds me of smosh tv the episode where they ate like 40 tacos and checked on their meth lab and the caged kid was licking the grease off Ian's fingers
Life is good again
Never would've imagined this happening EVER, but to see it happen NOW clearly makes me believe more and more that everything in life HAPPENS FOR A REASON!!!!, so Anthony welcome back to smosh and congratulations to both friends for being able to reconnect and have complete control of their channel again!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Watch him leave again in a couple of years💀
I'm so happy for you both to start this new character! Congratulations 🎉
Did you guys do the leg cross thing on opposite on purpose like you guys are trying criss cross apple sauce sit but in a mirror style kinda
what shoe brand is ian wearing
I have never watched Smosh, I only follow this channel... But I will give a chance to the new Smosh content. 😊
Man I learned about you guys back when i was 12/13 by word of mouth in our school. It was the sex education screamo the students would just randomly "sing" it in the hallways.
My inner child is healed
No, I should not have watched smosh when I was 6 years old.  Yes, I am absolutely glad I did it anyway. That shit was gold and I still think it's gold to this day.
Hey Anthony! You should try and do an interview with Rev Chris Lee. He's been on JOLLY a lot, has his own channel, etc. He has a good sense of humor and is good at explaining things where people can understand. Would be awesome!
Do jschlatt
Ian: what about a huge tapeworm comming out of my ass? Anthony: That's genius
smosh helped me a lot on learning english ❤
Smosh was icarly
I was soo crying watching them be back together after soo long.
I wasn't really gonna see this interview, just clicked on it because I had nothing else to do. But once I started I couldn't stop, so fun to hear your story. Awesome you're gonna be making videos again, love it!
♥❤
For all the business nerds amongst the crowd: Mythical Entertainment still holds a minority stake at Smosh and will stay on as advisers. This is a GOOD thing because Rhett and Link are INCREDIBLE at marketing and business strategy. The hitherto CEO of Smosh is out in favor of Alessandra Catanese, who was with Anthony’s company Pressalike. Pretty good gig
anthony was in his miley cyrus bangerz era
It just occurred to me, what happens to this channel?
I’ll hope you make newer Smosh videos like from 2006-2013. I believe in creative freedom and not kiddifying content for views; let’s make Smosh popular and funny again!
40:19
The ability of self-reflection and talking about it is perfection here.
I want more content of men in their 30s talking with each other about their feelings & personal growth. ❤
41:55 they are just a great pairing haha
This is the most important video uploaded to this website this whole year. Year's not even over yet, but it's still true. Fight me.
Ive been watching anthony for about a year now... it wasnt until this interview i actually knew who he was though.. my bf was OBSESSED with smosh
1:11:36 That one got me right in the feels.
Now that you are  back BRING BACK FOOD BATTLE
Anthony: We have never expressed emotions Ian: I still won’t  Me: 💀
Im so happy they did the do and made smosh a thing again..  I remember being like a lil guy and coming home to watch smosh everyday :D  Im so glad they are back and went to friendship agains
It used to be Anthony who would vent a lot during the Defy days and Ian would reassure him by focusing on the positives, and now Ian expresses his fears about the future and this time Anthony reassures him 😭 I'm fcking crying 😭
This is how controversy/beef/rumours should be sorted on YouTube… not the boxing matches 😂
dead serious: this is the greatest moment in Youtube history Friendship always wins !
Will you still be uploading frequently on this channel?
This was forseeable but unexcpeted nontheless
It would be cool if he spent a day with coryxkenshin
i hate that i’m crying so hard  this is so beautiful. y’all truly deserve this.   bring on the fan fictions  bring on the good vibes   congratulations to you both!!!
Not me crying about two YouTubers I’ve never seen before
a video with ex murderers would be cool
We need ghetto smosh colab
BABYS FIRST CHAIN 😭😭😭😭😭
Alright now that Anthony is back, now that Smosh is back in where it belongs, I don’t care what anyone says, I want Lazercorn, Joven, Sohinki, Mari, Boze, Wes, and Flitz back. No excuses.
This warmed my heart so much 🥹 I remember coming home from school and binging Smosh videos since we didn’t have cable at the time. It’s so good to see them together and reflecting on what brought them to where they are now! Keep being cool y’all 😭
Anthony looks like Chase Crossing find YouTube I wonder if it's him😮
I waited for this moment for so long
All good things must come to an end, sooner or later. It doesnt mean its broken or bad!
51:42 that laugh though...
I was going to comment about how happy I am to see my childhood celebrities turn out to be such well-spoken, mature and kind people - and then Anthony brought up the milk fic. Well, I still stand by the first part of this comment!
Ian Hecocks and Anthony Padildo are back at it again 🔥🔥🔥
This is how kramer vs kramer should have ended ❤
oh god, milk fic mention jumpscare
the John Lennon and Paul McCartney of Youtube Golden Era lol
Could you do an episode with Conservatives? Would be pretty interesting to say the least.
I still remember watching every Food Battle 😂😂
I wish YouTube had age groups and 18 n over could watch a bigger arrangement of videos and be allowed more creative freedom
yey
Impressive to see the silly, naïve boys from 2005 turn into matured, intelligent, solidified men. What a lovely conversation!
our daddies are back
I just shat myself
The amount of PTSD that came back in this moment 💀 1:12:53
"I spent a day with Ian hecox" 😂😂😂
ian looks so millenial
So sick! Shouts out to you guys and shouts out to Rhett and Link
You guys saying you started Smosh almost 18 years ago kept throwing me off because I was like, "There's no way I was only like 5 when I started watching Smosh." Then it hit me that I'm 25..... I was in third grade when I started watching youtube, probably about 2007. So not like, OG og, but pretty close. Yeah, watching all of the different paths you guys have gone down over the years has been a trip, I can't believe this is where we're at.
This is actually really interesting from a psychological perspective.  You two have gone through essentially what all couples go through in their lifetimes together. From the love to the hate to the laughs and misunderstandings. Even how it feels like to live together and ALWAYS be around each other.  It is something different for sure.
the Smosh The Movie fans needs to unite, we've been silenced for far too long
EXCITEMENT!
Wait SMOSH is back to Anthony & Ian??
It's like watching 2 close family members of yours, finally meeting back up and get to talking again. Puts a warm fuzzy feeling in my heart.
I’ve always missed having both of u on screen together. Smosh or not. U’ve always had more natural humor and Ian nails the awkward humor and can keep a straight face. The both of u together are a hilarious combination. I look forward to more from u two. Ur both amazing on ur own and powerful as a team. Keep being amazing
Yay we got Smosh back but now can we get emo Anthony back?
this video has me crying
It's soo cool to see both of you still creating! ❤
You should do spend a day with 5 min crafts
I’m so high and that sloth is so creepy 😩
Good friends drift apart but will always come back together
Also I want a low hug
Summer/winter whatever bring back the games😊
Man… I’ve missed you guys. I really want to meet you guys one day and thank you for making me laugh so much when I was younger when times were tough. Seeing you guys mature and grow into who you are now was honestly inspiring.
Bring back the games!!!!
I love you guys
Its so crazy because I grew with smosh I feel like now as an adult I changed so much and I’m glad Ian and Anthony rekindled their friendships I loved watching food wars and Pokémon in real life and I love watching them both now. My inner child is healed
Spend a day with Caitibugzz!!
Anthony, what do you think about spending a day with Scott Cawthon or ZachScottGames.
wassabi and smosh are both back? holy shit wtf is happening
You both were positively MY FAVORITE when I was younger. I think the best part about Smosh was I could watch the videos with my mom, who also thought you guys were hilarious. She also had a great sense of humor. We loved Charlie the guinea pig! <3
56:51
my middle school self is crying
What’s the milk fanfic?
Oh shit a new era of skits
I didnt even watch smosh before anthony left and this made me cry a little😂
I want Ian’s fit
i remember watching the smosh movie at like 6 years old it was so interesting
Nice video
ive cried about 5 times with just genuine happiness from the news of you guys coming back together and seeing how open and pure you have been with eachother on the return
My humor would not be the same without smosh
Awesome their back together again!!! They should write a book
Smoshed
Could you please do the vanoss crew next!!
God is real
I actually liked the Smosh movie. It was a pretty good movie.
The kids and me got the humor  😂😂 i love how deeply they can tallk for so long
I'll never forget when you guys ran from a zombie while on a treadmill
Massive props to Rhett and Link tbh. Not only did they immediately step up to buy Smosh, but the fact that they are willing to give it back to the original founders! Really shows how amazing all of these people are ngl
Its crazy how much I relate to all of this with my 2 best friends. We've all grown up, one has a kid, one moved many states away.... but every time we get together, the 3 of us, its like nothing ever changed. I'm glad you guys are friends again, I'm glad you guys are happy again.
Why does Ian look like dad with his cool, musician friend that never had kids? 😂
You can just tell how much both of them have matured and grown over the years this whole interview is so refreshing
Do a cover with I Set My Friends on Fire again
I remember when I first heard Anthony had left Smosh. it shattered and shocked me, but I was so down to watch each of them (Ian and Anthony) grow and do their own things, but I was so sad to not see them growing together anymore. So the fact that y’all are coming back together thanks to Rhett and Link (LOVE THEM SO MUCH MORE THAN I ALREADY DID BTW) is so amazing. I may have been wayyyy too young to have been watching Smosh (I’m 18 now but I was like 9-10 when I found their old content 😭) but this just makes me so happy TL;DR: I’m extatic that Anthony and Ian own Smosh. Love Rhett and Link for saving the channel <3
It’s ok to be excited and scared for what’s yet to come. But I’m so happy this happened. We all have to thank Rhett and Link for holding on and letting go too.
48:03 that was beautiful. For Anthony to remember something from that long ago, and it meant so much to him. Really shows how real of a friend he is
WHITE BOY SVMMER IS HERE QQQ
I've been watching since Smosh was young. With my depression and anxiety, you always made me smile. I'm still singing the Milky Milky Milkshake!!!
dude Smosh was such a happy part of my preteen years ...i would sit at home as a kid and watch smosh for hours. Lunchtime with smosh was my favourite series because it was just ian and anthony messing around and being authentic. this video has made my soul complete again lol
Bro, the fact that GMM saved Smosh’s ass by buying the company then seemingly sold it back no problem is super hero shit.
Ian is lot less aggressive these days
This makes me so happy man
Can you do a 'I spent a day with punks' video next?  Other video ideas: Rock bands Indie game devs / game developers  Rock bands Certain elderly groups Native Americans
After watching this, I feel like everything is possible 🥲
That hug at the start of the video defines almost all smosh natural essence. So happy you got this to happen.   OG's remember mailbox time and how great vibes this duo had
1:10:35 Even after all these years, these two are still the weirdest duo of entertainers ever. 😭💀
It’s crazy that I found Smosh when I was 13, 8th grade. And here I am 25 years old still loving them ❤️ so excited for them back together, makes me happy and nostalgic!!
This is couples counseling lol
"if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you" brb sobbing my eyes out 😭
When Anthony left, I wanted Ian to follow him. Now, I am glad he didn't because I don't think they would have fully healed their friendship and grow without that time apart. I am glad they are back together ❤️
Anthony I am so happy for this, I've been watching you guys since 2007 I really loved OG Smosh videos and I am excited to be what's on those twisted mind of yours, how Ian said, let's burn this to the ground... I be there as well
this warmed my heart !!
The collab we've all been waiting for
This is a great discussion. I think they're right about why Smosh appealed to me when I was a kid, it was because it was like a live action cartoon. I agree with them that the Smosh movie was bad. I can't wait for their new sketches!
I just realized that someone could have been born the day Smosh uploaded their first video and they're going to turn 18 the same day Smosh turns 18
This is such a good video. Great example of healthy communication I think
Im here for mealtime with smosh
I was little when I found SMOSH I havnt laughed as hard as I did watching that channel since
them talking about the milk fic at the end....... the wave of horrified nostalgia that hit me was like a 200mph gut punch
I bet it was hard at being famous & successful at a young age. Especially in such a public way. It feels like Anthony let a lot of weight off his chest in this episode.
Cool! Anthony and Ian together again! What kind of facts we...  - *SHUT UP!!*
In hindsight if you guys made a cartoon kinda like regular show I think that would’ve popped off
Prob should be renamed to like “Reconnecting with Ian” or something cuz this isn’t really ab Ian solely since it’s more both of u guys
This is such a good chapter in the saga of Smosh. It’s like two brothers reconnecting after one left home and the other was left behind to look after the parents. Both grew in such beautiful ways and they’ve both gone through their own hardships, finally being able to face each other and sit in their emotions os so commendable. Im so happy to live to this day.
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
DIANA, The true MVP
Didn’t you own smosh
Anthony
Ian looks like Steve Jobs now
Take a shot every time Ian says “like”
Very wholesome. I'm so happy for you guys
They should’ve left as soon as they found out they were swindled
You guys are honestly, living legends on Youtube. You guys were part of my childhood and seeing you guys grow into mature adults but still staying true to your roots is definitely amazing! Now, it feels so great to be living in this timeline and seeing this. Can't wait for more content from you and the team.
Im glad he didn't use the regular structure and made this feel like a nice personal conversation between friends rather than an interview
Bring back boxman
I’m super excited to see new Smosh content! It would be cool to see sketches featuring other YouTube creators as guest characters or something.
Rhett and link being childhood best friends who preserved smosh and then happily sold it back after Anthony and Ian were able to come together again has me crying
You could do a section thats calles “smosh, but works”
Really touching to see you guys talking again. I hope y’all are doing well!
We love to see men acknowledge and work through feelings. So happy for Ian and Anthony!
This is genuinely so like pure, to friends talking about what went right and what went wrong and are trying to fix it for their sake.
This collaboration didnt hit me until ian made the suicide joke and then I was like "holy shit, smosh is really back"
when are we getting more Asstoast?
BRING BOZE BACK TO SMOSHHHH I WANT TO SEE EVERYONES REUNION
Shut up!
I truly wish the best for you both
Are we... finally back on the good timeline???
I remember enjoying the Smosh movie that one time i watched it all those winters ago.
This literally feels like a dream come true like I’ve only ever imagined smosh getting back together
Food Battle 2023 pls
1:11:15 - 1:11:55 😭💕
I feel like there's some bad blood between them. The way they laugh when the other says something that might be too critical. Idk, I cringed a bit in some parts.
Anthony is partly at fault for leaving the burden of the Smosh with Ian, but at the same time, I totally understand why Anthony would do such a thing. From what they said, both perspectives seem genuine. Either way, I am extremely happy that they are rekindling their friendship.
I do love that Ian is pro-fanfiction. He is genuinely amused by it.  Also, Ian saying “If we burn it down, I’m happy to burn it down with you.” is truly wonderful and pure friendship.
It’s really sweet to see how excited they both are, how they needed to let go of all their preconceptions and just get back to having fun together. Hopefully they can find a way to minimise the business aspect of their friendship as much as possible, or at least find plenty of time to just hang out in between
These two have great chemistry, they should maybe work together on a project in the future or something.
OMGG BRING FOOD WARSSSS BACKKK!!!!!!@!!!!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳💜
20:20
I remember early 2000's SMOSH fondly.
!Congrats!
Ik it's not quite the OG Smosh, but...bring back shut up cartoons! XD loved teleporting fat guy xD and the planets one
💓💓
so many years has passed since me and my friend sat there in front of a thick screen monitor laughing at those classic smosh vids, holy... time has done it's thing.
finally, it has happened
OK, now please collaborate with WKUK
look who ever does the posting and everything. I just want to say I thank you for the like timestamp  that puts the video in selections
I am beyond happy for you and Ian being able to rebuild a friendship let alone get your company back! Amazing. Also Rhett and Link being so supportive is the Best! That just shows what lovely humans they are on and off screen! 🥰
i think Ian likes the word like, like a lot, like I think like thats just who he is is like you know like just like himself
this is not the real anthony and ian
This whole video is genuinely just heartwarming. You two are literally the most iconic duo in youtube history in my mind so seeing you both back, motivated and just excited to be together creating again has made my day.
Nature is healing.
A part of me is worried that the old Smosh style skits would be outdated for today’s standards but then i thought about the high number of absurdist, off-kilter comedy vids on tiktok and youtube these days and how much they blew up, i honestly feel like a more mature take on Smosh skits would not only work but would be popular amongst newer audience. I hope they dont rely on old references. Also i know earlier Smosh stuff were pretty much toilet humour but after a while most of them turned more absurdist than toilet
Can we get a smash 2 the boys are back?
43:17 HOMELESS MILLIONAIRE VID MEMORIES
I'm glad they are seeing things sustainably cuz, as a guy who grew up on the classic smosh videos, I OF COURSE love to see some nostalgic classic sketches coming back but, it surely isn't a sustainable idea to just cater to the nostalgia factor. Cuz there's a generation of kids who grew up in the Defy era.  And I want to see them succeed doing what they love.
1:10:52 lmfao Anthony's face like "I am so fucking done with those"
1:04:04 Am I crazy or is that the most Ian's face has lit up the entire video? ^u^
Los dioses son reales si crees en ellos si vuelven ojala que puedan traer de nuevo las voces del doblaje latino
Hey can you spent a day with ishowspeed?
Nature is healing ❤
Good video
Now THIS is a plot for a movie 🎬🎬🎬
This is a beautiful example of two adults expressing their feelings healthily. I love that you two are back and more mature than ever 💜
Bring back Food Battle
As a fan of GMM originally, becoming a fan of SMOSH after Anthony leaving, then finding this channel and enjoying his ability to open up and give great interviews, I am super excited to see what amazing creations are coming our way.   Congratulations on becoming friends again and being able to take back what rightfully belonged to you both, best of luck to all your creative endeavors!
I was into YT a lot while Ian and Anthony were going pretty strong then I had a phase middle school where I stopped watching YouTube videos a lot for years. Then fresh out of highschool I just looked up smosh again because I saw something on Facebook. Been keeping up ever since, and when I heard this announcement I just felt like life is going to be okay, good things do survive.
Make Youtube Great Again!!!
Does anyone know what shoes Ian is wearing? They look so good and I want a pair :)  Also this is the best news I’ve heard all year I can’t wait to follow them in whatever they do!
I honestly didn't think they would get back together or get smosh back. I think everything will definitely work out for them
I MISS LUNCHTIME WITH SMOSH !! 😢😢😢
We need a “Spent a day with “Hitmen”
im kinda sad i wasnt as into smash back then but im glad i still knew about it and watched it
Smosh was all gold & every segment
Anthony never left that emo phase………
The good old days were so good🥹
52:30 BEST PART OF THIS TALK LFG NO MICKEY MOUSE BS
I just want to say that I genuinely look up to Anthony. I don’t want to undermine what Ian did while sticking with Smosh. But Anthony was able to put himself first and he did eventually find his creative voice. Anthony was able to let go of Smosh for himself, and that is something that is truly hard to do. And for that I genuinely applaud Anthony. I just love the old Smosh but I know that time only moves forward so I just hope to see some more amazing content from both of them.
23 years old right now and happy to see my dads get together again. Can't wait
I don't know if it is just me , the f@ckin 0.001 sec made me totally exploded with laughter, not because of if I am moved or warm heated Just that Hilarious and how surreal this scene is
It's ironic that Anthony left for corporate differences but he is back super optimistic for a great chance while Ian stayed because he felt he was already given a great chance and now he is a bit more cynical for all the corporate drama with Defy.
you should really do “I spent a day with poketubers”
I thought you somehow got Edward Snowden lol.
Damn shame they didn't talk about smosh gaming in depth. I grew up on that channel and i wanted to know more about their relationships on that side.
is it just me or is Ian acting a bit douchy and insensitive at times during this interview? Anthony is pouring his heart out and Ian keeps throwing accusations at him. If this is what their relationship has been like over those years I can see why Anthony wanted out... And trust me this is coming from someone that has always looked up to Ian more so than Anthony growing up watching their content.
This is fucking amazing 😭😭😭😭
Hey Anthony, I was wondering if you’d be interested in doing an episode with people who have Social Anxiety
Food battle 2023😏
I missed the” Ian is bored” days Laughed a a lot watching it back then seeing these guys just chilling without a sketch and seeing how funny they were naturally. Kesha song and Canon Penis were my favs.
Sorry random question but does anyone else want Anthony to spend a day with f1nn
I am feeling yall so much. So glad this happened for you two, for all staff at smosh, and for Rhett&Link/Mythical. It just feels better for everyone, but it feels like you two have healed So Much.
x2 then normal speed halfway through it needed to be watchee at real speed
Men talking about feelings is HOT!!! Thank you so much 👏 it frustrates me so much that men typically don’t talk about feelings because SOOOOOO many problems would be solved! Thank you for doing this! Seriously!
do a podcast with ray william johnson
Oh my God, I completely forgot about all of Anthony's crying sketches~lol.
41:56??? I still won't followed by a serious face?? damn
I’ve watched these motherfiretruckers since the first food battle, and if you don’t hire back Flitzs I’m gonna be one sad man😂😂😂😂
Seeing these two reunite makes me so happy. Its beautiful to see this full circle moment of them reuniting and taking back smosh together.   But it has to be said that the smosh brand wouldnt be a thing to buy back without ian. What a legend.😊
Sobbing. Alex and Roi (SpicyFruit) finally came back together and now Anthony and Ian (Smosh)!? SOBBING.
Wait does this mean there is a potential of mykie coming on smosh I used to be a big fan of hers and really miss the content
The fact that you guys are back  brings me so much joy and  Nostalgia. ❤ bringing back the shitttss and gigglesss & adult content 👌 now u both can be ur authentic selfs
The only good joke in the smosh movie was stone cold creamy cream. And that’s the bottom line
Hearing this conversation makes me fairly convinced Rhett and Link were inspired by these guys to return to their roots with their original channel as well. It might not be true but I'd like to believe they were moved by the passion to recapture the essence of SMOSH.
You guys could totally make a new smosh movie just going through everything you went through with smosh just recreating the bigger details. And showing sorta “behind the scenes.” (Their story is literally history they’re some of the first biggest YouTubers) and it’d be an interesting story they really did need to grow apart to grow back together to realize how little things actually have changed.
I needed something like this. for once man im so glad!
1:11:28 😭
Antony Padilla is the Giordi Rosado of the US
loved these two as a kid i used to watch them all the time until they broke up and went their separate ways so glad y’all are back together :D
Gotta be the realest conversation between friends I’ve ever seen
I love you guys. You guys have a part in my good childhood
Good ending reached
i really needed a good comedy channel to rely on to make me laugh it’s been missing ever since Unus Annus TvT THANK YOU
spend a day with Teleporting Fat Guy, I mean...he was one of the character back then
Lowkey idk why but I would love to see Anthony and Sam Reich from Dropout sit down and talk. CollegeHumor was one of the other sketch comedy giants on YouTube and I feel like the way that Sam has used his business acumen to found Dropout and keep that sort of style of comedy alive while also transforming it into something bigger and innovative is a really parallel story to what’s being said about Smosh’s journey.
idk this is fuvcked cus all I can think about is "THE BOXMAAAAAAN!"
Wtf the Smosh boys were Refused fans? Thats amazing lol shoutout to the post-hardcore fans
I wonder how lenient Rhett and Link were when negotiating the purchase? How much of it was like, "we wanna give it back to you but we gotta charge you money for reasons," and how much of it was, "we own your brand now, it's making us money, we'll give it back to you for $X but otherwise can't help you."
Alright… next time. I SPENT A DAY WITH THE ANNOYING ORANGE
mann i remember the pokemon video my big brother showed it to me it was so entertaining & i enjoyed smoosh content back then
1:08 Yes!!!!! Woohoo!!! 55:00 love this part of the video, where the organic humour of the chemistry you share comes across and it actually feels like 2 friends having fun 😊
from 2008-2010 these 2 dudes were my only form of enterntainment!
But but food wars right you will have a food wars
I still remember picking up the smosh magazine
Smosh goes on joe rogan ????
This just makes me so happy
Yea... it wont burn the whole internet is watching guys. Youll get to the stars
I never thought this day would come.
My favourite Smosh videos were you guys opening fan mail. I hope to see you doing that again
30:39 that’s not right that they didn’t actually come in person and say that to you guys. When they laid off 3/4 of our office, the entire executive team came.   That email at 6 PM on Friday, though? “Please be in the office on Tuesday morning”. We knew it was no good.
Jesus I just realized I was 26 days old when you made this account my birthday is November 2nd 2006
food battle 2023?
Is this where I request a hardcore max video now? But like all grown up
Will charlie the drunk guineapig return?
i really hope they don’t stay this weird and politically correct. i really hope they become funny as shit again
Never Knew They would basically make a Red Table Talk without will smith
I really love that Rhett and Link's first response was "ok yeah buisness sure but WE'RE SO EXCITED TO SEE YOU TWO CREATING TOGETHER AGAIN"
I didn't really watch much of smash. But when I knew and saw them it was when Anthony was there. It's funny that I rediscovered smosh and only started watching them THIS year and within months of Anthony returning lol
I like to have the two takes on how both felt Was this better than therapy?
I TOTALLY FORGOT YALL DID POKEMON LIP SYNC HOLY SHIT DUDE!!!
I am happy that today I'm still alive because i could see this grand return. i love you guys.
34 minute mark you made me cry happy tears im gonna reach out to my friends
This is crazy.
Your friendship makes me so emotional lol. I’m happy y’all are back together
lmao why would you spend an entire day with him he is a ruthless criminal
feels like a childhood memorie is repaired
kissing video when?
i think that the worst thing to happen is that their friendship became business
bring back food battles
I can't believe it ❤ Ian and Anthony back together
HELL YEAH I BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR THIS, ive been watching smosh since i was 6 so 15 years ive been a fan and im so excited for smosh and for the future of smosh
Never clicked on a video so fast. So happy to see you two together again. Love you both so much, thanks for making my childhood. ❤️
Please think about bringing back Lunchtime with Smosh! I think if you didnt want it to be exactly the same it could make a good podcast, i grew up watching every new video while i ate lunch and itd be so fucking cool if that could happen again
I never really watched the early years of Smosh, because I was pretty much just born, but I was always curious as to what happened to it. I would remember how you guys used to be in this group but I never knew what actually happened.  I am glad you guys were able to reconnect and I hope Smosh grows up to be successful for y'all.
This is actually such a beautiful conversation to witness. ❤
Thank you Ian for continuing to work on smosh while Anthony stepped away. After all that hard work, the gang is back together!
Milk fanfic!??!!???
There's Anthony we found him!
sheesh
I was a smosh fan back when the movie came out and me and my homies loved it lol
The symbolism of mythical media keeping smosh together until Ian and Anthony could buy it back isnt lost on me. A tale of two friendships, one that was together from the beginning helping another find each other again. I remember Rhett talking about their rough patch when they were making like 4 videos a day
“Dude! Do not bring up the milk fanfic.” 🤣🤣 I’ve read it… ohhhh boy…. Please DONT bring that back.
I swear it’s been like 15 years or something and his last name still makes me giggle 💀
I watched smosh when I was 4
Can we just applaud Ian’s style, the man is STUNTIN RIGHT NOW!!!!🥵😮‍💨
Beautiful
i love smosh and i just love ian so much. i would really love to see lunchtime with smosh come back, even just once a year. those were comfort videos for me back in the day.
I can tell than Ian definitely wants to clap them Padilla cheeks.
homies support homies 🤝
ANTHONY PADILLA WHAT IS THE SPONGEBOB UNDERWEAR YOU WORE IN THE POKEMON VID
they did yet another 1 hour video of them talking only thing that’s different about this is that they’re not walking
So like.... food battle 2023 or 2024?
Why am I so excited?  I hadn't even watched smosh
Thank you Ian 💓
Ian can still make Anthony giggle the same way ❤  I hope they take some time to re learn eachother now as adults off camera and try to discover eachother and see if they can be friends. The time apart, breaking down and rebuilding, makes for the strongest relationships. They could become closer because of this ❤
Props to Ian. He never gave up on smosh. He went through hell and back and I get it Anthony did to, but it truly does show Ian to be the rightful owner. The reunion was odd and the fact that Anthony got excited about buying it and right away joining the team again doesn't sit well with me. Sorry.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
them talking about the fan fictions at the end blew my mind. i myself never read them but i was exposed to the subculture i guess and hearing them mention the “milk fanfic” absolutely unhinged the floodgates of so many memories of my early internet days i might just curl up and sob
Love smosh and so happy they’re back but i’m wondering what will happen with this channel? Will he continue?
never in my life would I have thought of you guys sitting here today, grown and serious. my childhood Youtube memories picture you guys as funny and ecstatic, you guys look like you changed but in such a good way. I'm glad I'm alive to watch this.    *DEPTH* that's the word I was looking for.
I cannot wait to see the unhinged side of Anthony again ❤️❤️❤️😂
Anthony leaving was part of the event cannon
i watched og smosh religiously when i was younger and saw how much it changed when it was bought and was so disapointed. Im with Anthony on that. Im so happy for you guys that you are the owners again and get to get it back to the real smosh content.
Honestly, I wish you guys would get married!
CONGRATULATIONS, guys!
Well, this is fucking beautiful.
The God Father's 🙏🙏🙏
I'm glad to see you guys get ownership of YOUR company you guys started and built together.  I'm also glad you guy reconnected, as friends, if Rhett and Link can be friends and business partners you can too.  Just got to give space sometimes and also do things that bring friendships together.
Hey man, you need to do this with KSI. Would love to see you two link up!
Omg!! Yesss!! Get the OG cast of smosh games too! Jovenshire, mari❤
The fact that people actually said Anthony was nothing without smosh is crazy. I didn't watch smosh after he left😂 Ian held it down tho ngl.
When I look at Ian, all I can see is Steve Jobs
The card story was so sweet
I hope it isn't too much to ask just one favor. I agree that you shouldn't make this a Nostalgia fest and shouldn't be making the same old content. But... can we please have food battle again. 🥺👉👈
I will say I’ve grown up on watching smosh and Ian is honestly so much more himself when Anthony his around. Even in the most recent smosh pit videos with Anthony he was so much more open and less lost. I’m just so happy their back and I can’t wait to see what they achieve working together again. I love these men and I hope all goes well for them in the next chapter of their channel
1:13:20 yup
I admit, I was a bit too young when i watched Smosh videos, but I still have so many good memories of it. Happy to see you guys back and now that I’m older, I’ll definitely appreciate the humor more
Y’all were funny cringe then and funny cringe now ❤️ congratulations on getting Smosh back!
Welp, just gotta say, they are both hot and funny now. ❤
This gives me the same feeling as the video message Steve from Blues Clues posted checking in on his generation of grown-up kids ❤🥹
Damn y’all really raised me and are coming back when I have a 9-5 adult income to spend on smosh shit, genius plan….take my money
I miss u guys
I can’t believe a big piece of my childhood is back, this is the best thing to happen since 2020 I’m gonna cry 😭
This healed my inner child in a way I didn’t know I needed 🎉 cheers to a beautiful friendship and laughs love you too!!
I couldn’t believe that the script was based around small kids. I’m like this is totally matured humor but then I remember I was a little kid watching these videos. I literally laugh the same amount I did back then.
what a legendary moment guys!
This was the best podcast style thing to listen to while on the train 👍
Pleeeaaase bring back Lunchtime with Smosh! I would love to see you guys continue to talk and catch up like this and just be human together over some food.  I think a lot of your fans have gone through similar periods of confusion and self-growth and it would be so healing to see you guys like that again.  Either way it’s so amazing to see you two back together! We missed you guys!! ❤❤❤
42:54 watching Anthony fall a tear for what must've been difficult to express is so brave 😢
I love this. I was showing my partner your old videos as something I used to watch just before you announced your reunion. this is great, I can't wait to see what you come up with. Also, it's so cool to see your personalities together again!
Man  It Is Very Happy to See Both Of Them Again   I Will Never Forget That Day Went i was In Elementary School  One Day I Watch Youtube In My labtop and I Search Zombie Videos And After That I Came Across Thier Video Smosh Vs Zombies    It Was One Of The Best Smosh Video To This Day Ever   I Really love that Vd So Much  It Is On My Top Best 10 Smosh Vd Right Up There All lot   I Will Never Forget That To This Day Ever    Thank You Guys To Inspired Me And Everybody Out There All lot
I remember the smosh that was just you both and the pokemon lip sync, the food battles, the skits, the original songs i still own the zelda rap  ive missed you both making content together
Ian definetely has some strong walls up still. Anthony is being really vulnerable here on the other hand. Feels like some kind of power-struggle in some way, but I really feel like they're breaking new ground here.
This is so heartwarming ❤
I really appreciate the honestly and candor here. Congrats on re-acquiring Smosh
Boom
The Smosh movie was absolutely horrible. That being said, I really, really enjoyed it. Make another one.
If theres an internet history course - this should be one of the chapter
WHOOOO spends a day with WHOOOOOOOOOO??????
Ian still seems a bit passive aggressive in a way lol but I’m happy they both own Smosh again. I honestly would’ve probably left too, that seems crazy feeling like something you’ve created is being ripped from you. I also understand Ian being left to deal with it all on his own would make him resentful too tho.
9:47 That kid who watched the old Smosh videos, is now 24 years old working adult, trying to not cry over the reunition of Smosh.
Lol love it when they are being genuine with each other. That's Smosh.
i wonder if ian didnt watch this episode too lmao
39:37
HEY HEY HEY ARE YOU STILL DOING FOOD BATTLE 2023 THAT WOULD BE NICE
The next lifetime movie right here🥲
i first discovered Smosh at 12 years old in middle school.. it was the Pokémon in real life video to be exact, and i would watch Smosh after school everyday until high school. by then, i would grow out of my “little boy” stage, they signed with Defy, and it felt too childish for me. after highschool, i was experiencing a very hard breakup, and saw a Smosh video with Shayne Cortney Kieth and Noah, and immediately fell back in love with Smosh, and binged almost a 3 years worth of content within a month. Finding out Anthony left, i also resented him for giving up on his best friend and a company they built. i kept watching Smosh until the end of 2021, as then i started going through addiction /; a long year later, i was getting sober and once again turned to Smosh as comfort. 1:01:22 , Ian talks about it being a comfort channel to others, and it really hits home, as i have always came back to this channel for self peace and a way to escape reality. i first want to say thank you to Rhett and Link for keeping this brand alive when it was down and out, as i’ve also been a fan of GMM since 2018. and i would also like to thank you two for always being apart of peoples lives, and impacting people in a positive manner. i’m a complete stranger to these dudes, but i feel like i’ve grown with them, experienced my own trials and tribulations along with there’s, and the channel has never left me. we owe it to you two fellas to keep the brand alive now. thank you gentlemen
Bring back lunchtime with smosh 😢
🥹
I'm a 20 year old that grew up on your videos jesus this is insane
Are you ever going to post on this Chanel again?
Me my brother and my cousin use to watch Smosh glad they are back
Anthony’s emotional vulnerability in this video >>> his growth has been incredible to see. Ian as well!
I’m actually tearing up a bit  I grew up watching Smosh and now seeing them reunite is absolutely amazing
these two were my whole childhood growing up. it’s so sweet seeing them reuniting with each other again ❤️‍🩹
Mail time with Smosh was the highlight of my evenings after school when I was a kid ❤️
I am happy Ian also went to therapy. As sb who was also dropped intoa leadership role pretty suddenly...it is honestly a bit traumatizing especially if you are also dealing with some stuff in your personal life. Not to mention Ian is still pretty young, in most corporate settings people who have teams of 20+ people are over 40 and the transition is very gradual.  To have such a  huge team and production at such a young age without proper support or a person he can actually fully trust must have been extremely mentally taxing, especialy since you are also trying to balance respect, authority and healthy work relationships-friendships.
Does that mean Stevie will be back?
Ian’s persona is so interesting, it’s like he’s double sided. Very stoic and neutral, then all of a sudden he’s unhinged and manic 😅  Anthony is more outwardly emotional and it was cute to see how touched he was about the situation. After seeing all the new videos we can see how much it means to Ian too ❤
Great Video
A day with Sean Evans would be pretty cool.
Hearing the DeFY story reminds me of the German company MEDIAKraft
I wish you made vlogs again
I am so In shock that this is happening, you guys becoming friends again and buying smosh literally made my year. Thankyou Ian and Anthony for doing this 🥲
My English got so much in college watching Smosh! I loved your videos so much
Love Ian’s fashion he’s rocking everything
Idk if you guys need to hear this, but this is literally one of the most amazing and unique conservations to happen, ever. Such a gift to humanity that you guys openly talked like this transparently to us. Absolute fucking treasures.
Anthony you’re like the hipster boss battle level 100
I’m going to need a summary of the mentioned fan fiction.
I think Rhett and Link being 100% down to sell smosh really speaks to what great guys they are. Not only did they step up and save smosh but they were excited to get it back into the hands of Ian and Anthony. Love those two and I’m so glad smosh temporarily ended up with people like them who care about more than business and money
Name a better duo.  I’ll wait.
I’m so excited to see where this goes. I grew up on smosh and I’m excited to feel that nostalgia you guys are talking about but also the fresh twist on it. I think it’s gonna be great and I’m so excited for you guys to be back in the captains chairs together.
Move to floatplane
They're the Sam and Dean of YouTube ❤
I feel like he needs to do an episode with Alan Becker
1:00:00 best moment to hear from you guys!!! I’m so excited to see you guys create again.. litterally anything! Always been my biggest inspirations 🙏🏼
I remember smosh and I can say that it was my childhood and I love the older videos because it was more funnier in my opinion. And when my mom took a photo of me I was on my phone was watching of course smosh with Ian being silly and I’ve ofc showed it to the camera when she took the photo
ill say this Im an old viewer  and I love smosh but yeah as to what you guys where saying id very much love new content from you guys im glad youre back
legend of zelda? legend of smosh
Anthony leaving smosh is a canon event
"New Classic Smosh" So happy.
I have never seen Ian this serious
Does this mean we aren’t getting Boxman 3.0? 😔
me waiting for FOOD BATTLE!!!
Is there something better than watching two grown men become friends once again after conflicts in their youth?
smash babies was s tier tho and i stand by it 9:04
Y'know I'm sure some of us had suspicions when you two kept posting each other on IG because it seemed flirtatious. Sorry. Anyway ty guys for being so vulnerable! I remember when maybe you guys were first starting to really detach from Smosh, because as a fan from when the channel started you feel this fun amazing vibe from this side of the screen , I remember feeling I couldn't watch Smosh because i didn't feel anything from Smosh but maybe  I felt something good from the smosh crew.. I just assumed I was growing up and I have different taste in comedy and made me feel more depressed about life at the time. I still tried to keep up with you guys through IG. BUT HEY! GONGRATS BOYS! LETS GOOOOOOO! YOu guys can always pull out marshmallows if there's a fire. *knock knock*
Hasan called he wants his personality back
True smosh fans will remember this :putnam:
They are back again ❤
God i havent seen smosh with these two since i was in middle school
I’ve been watching you guys since I was really young…I’m so glad y’all are back. I couldn’t be happier
Good
First Spicy Fruit, and now Smosh is back, its bringing me back to the good ol days 😭🙌💯
Tomahawk chop is my death blow
my childhood. best of luck on the new era boys.
I am so, SO happy for you two. The serendipity of it just working out perfectly gave me chills, and hearing the joy and surprise of how well writing that sketch went brought tears to my eyes. I love that it's not a nostalgia thing, either. There will be an entire new generation of Smosh fans!
I think we need to hear the BFF song we need the remix asap🙌🏽
❤
Smosh was my childhood. Stopped watching a bit before Anthony left but I’m back now that they bought the channel back
The chucky cheese pic of Ian is crazy to me
I would love to see this story as a movie in the same vein as "The Founder" or movies like that
I am reminded of a quote that I've been meaning to share. Reminds me of this development.  We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.  T. S. Eliot
I need a 2023 remake of the pokemon rap lol
Ain't nothing like the timing of Providence
I started watching smosh when I was like late 5 years old and smosh was born the same year when I was born. That’s insane for me to think about.
Add this to the list of videos that made me cry 😭
im so glad both smosh men now dress like the metrosexual men they used to make fun of a decade and a half ago. full circle, really
Idgaf The Smosh movie was bomb. Watch that shit high and it’s spectacular
OMG Anthony!! I cried with you too, so happy to watch this!!!
Seeing Ian speak candidly and be real is strange.  He's always so silly, but turns out he's an intelligent thoughtful person.  And I can tell despite the rough spots and growing pains that Ian really cares about Smosh and continues to do hilarious content.... Also Shayne is a goldmine for sketch comedy, so good staffing.
So much was let off their chests in this, specifically Ian’s. You can tell he had a lot pent up and the way he navigated it was a huge step. Anthony seems to have an easier time being vulnerable, which definitely came from leaving the company, but Ian is still a bit reserved and that comes from him staying behind. But him saying what he did shows a huge step in opening back up. So excited for this, smosh was my childhood.
if you two did a podcast that would be so sick
It's hard for words to describe the feeling this gives me. The pure positivity of GMMs actions being the crutch they needed until they could stand on their own just warms my heart. Big thanks to GMM and even bigger congrats to the both of you for this milestone. I'm eager to see where this goes
It’s so weird seeing these two guys act mature together.
Here just for the mutual respect.
What you guys have is so special. It's so difficult to lose a best friend then gain them back again, speaking as someone who had a ride or die childhood best friend that is a stranger to me now. Much love over here, keep being yourselves and taking care of yourselves
Actually see you 2 together Again makes this life wonderful.
Yeaaahhh the first flare up of an autoimmune condition is a BITCH
Smosh was my childhood. I was really into smosh when i was younger and could easily sense the tension in the vlogs, but i didn't understand what was going on. I just remember discussing it with my sister and asking why you guys were acting so negatively to each other and in general. I remember the part where anthony was hiding under a table and saying he didn't want to do shit and Ian was like we have to do our work. But I didn't get the whole story and I didn't understand why this situation was happening. It was just very obvious that Anthony was not happy and was imploding. As an audience member, i was aware that things aren't what they are presented especially in the comic sketches but I liked you guys as people, moreso than the comedy. You were both silly, cute, but on top of that, I always thought you were good and inspirational people (and I also live by you guys but never met you). Now you both have grown into responsible and respectable adults. That, to me, is more important than the amount of videos you put out and the funny sketches. What's most important is that two people who the internet loves and admires are happy doing their thang. I'm just really glad you guys are rekindling what you really love: each other and smosh. :) It seems Anthony has gone through a whole transformation, emotionally and as a person. Ian, you're on your way and getting there. I can't wait to see how Ian grows as a person within the next few years too. The best part is I understand the resentment and stories from both sides. At the end of the day, you guys were really angry at each other because you felt betrayed/abandoned by someone you loved dearly. I'm glad you're both able to grow past this to become more evolved people.
Been watching Smosh since like 2010.  The channel has been good as ever imo.  So happy for you guys to be able to do this.  It's a good feeling story to me and I'm excited to see what you guys do in the future!
Anthony leaving smosh was a canon event
Bring back Smosh Summer or Winter games.
i’m happy ian and anthony bought smosh back but did ian really have to mention the milk fic in this blessed and cursed year of 2023 😭😭
I hope they got the "shut up! " again!
Anthony was the main one expressing him self and Ian still needs help, I know I ain’t the only one who notice that he still struggles to connect, but I’m happy they working it out
Can you interview Linus sabasgen from Linus tech tips
Not the milk fan fic again…
There is a smosh movie ???
"We don't wanna pander to the nostalgia crowd"  .....does that mean we're not getting Food Battle 2023?
Thank you for this it gives me hope that one day I'll have a connection so genuine
play game, living together, working together, hanging out... basically like a gay couple 😂
I know they just got back, but please bring back some of the actors and actresses too. Like teleporting fat guy, that damn neighbor, etc!
Finally, epic food battle 2017
So glad to see papa franku back in cold ones!
my inner child is truely healed. They basically built the foundation that my humor is based on, even nowadays. The memories of how much i enjoyed their first years of videos will forever be ingraned in me 🥹
Og I thought they where brother irl
Two duuuudes chilling in a interview five feet apart cause they're not gay
Has it been 6 years since Anthony left Smosh??
Watching their Short brought me right back to Lunchtime with Smosh silliness! I’m happy they’re happy! 😄
This is so cool and it's making me wanna watch your new YouTube videos just like 15 years ago. Amazing to see two adults working on their friendship after so long, I think you deserve all the success.
1:11:36 idk man, this made me tear up a bit lol🥺
Is this what it means to start healing your inner child? 😭
sorry but at the end there Anthony's Ian impression is on point 🤣
I better see y’all on SNL in like a couple of months lol
Its been like 7 years, Ian Looks like he gained a PHD, Anthony looks like he moved to New York
Anthony can you please spend a day with joji
Ian looks like a 1980s porn director
Let's fucking goooooo
Felicitaciones muchachos por volver, aún tienen un público hispanohablante que también se pone feliz por esta noticia ❤
Idk what it was about Lunchtime w/Smosh but I watched all of em. I still say "mmMmm hamburger" 😂
I am so happy guys so happy for you, for Smosh, everything needed to happen this way, just keep calm and do it with joy! ❤
Do One with a H2ODelirious
The smash movie was great. Stop.

Here's hoping you guys get all you want out of Smosh in the future, and I wish you all the best. I never imagined I would be sharing your videos with my kids, but here we are. Looking forward to seeing what you guys will come up with! <3
BEST THING EVER!! I was so obsessed with smosh as a kid , bought the albums , freaked about Smosh magazine , im so happy , childhood restored ❤❤❤❤❤
Everybody do be googling milk and Smosh right now
I was 4 when I started watching you guys 💀
So happy to see Smosh back together 🥺 and the fact that ya'll can talk about that experience across years. This is the best of 2023 ngl.
Spend a day with Schlatt!!!!
I remember when I saw the top comments always be like Ian is the funny one and Anthony is the cute one I knew Anthony would be so outraged this is so funny hahaha people areso fn stupid
I'm happy for you guys. Bros for real thank God Smosh is and always has been you two. Even when Anthony was away Ian kept it there and shaped a family rather than just a crew. You guys are so funny and I really miss my old friends. I just hope my buds are doing well even if I don't talk to them or whatever.  Fuck this made me cry man, you guys deserve your company you deserve happiness and this is great, your energy and enthusiasm and entertainment had helped create smiles through the waves of the internet. I love you guys please always be hot and funny it really works for the whole Smosh thing ⛽
42:46 anyone else spot what looks like a tear in Anthony's eye when he talks about their friendship? It's honestly heart warming watching this moment and i do not blame him if he was actually tearing up here.
smosh is responsible for a ton of my humor as a teen. So happy to see yall back at the reins
Smosh is already in their DNA
All we need is for Ray William Johnson to bring back =3 tik tok edition 😂
LOOOOOL IAN "i still wont"
I have been using YouTube as a source of joy and distraction for many many years of my life now and have come to have such respect for creators who do this, seemingly thanklessly. I look up to you all as a source of inspiration, yet I see the hilarity and fun and success and have found ways to feel bad about myself for not making my own joy like you have (from an outsider's perspective, it always looks so perfect). Despite intuitively knowing that you all are still just humans trying their best, it's too easy to put you on a pedestal when all we can see is the good stuff. This video and its deep honesty and vulnerability has seriously touched my soul. I'm at a place in my life where my identity and its dependence on my success and relationships is causing some pretty significant strife. Thank you so very much for proving that success and happiness don't always go hand-in-hand, and that it is never too late to have the conversations needed to repair relationships. You've lightened my heart and I appreciate it so much. Just writing this comment to put this newfound peace into words, out into the universe, is healing by itself. Congratulations on your individual journeys and on your bravery to come back together and start a new one! I'm rooting for you!
This is truly heartwarming. Been a Smosh fan since the Pokemon theme song and this video makes me feel some type of way.
i remember watching smosh back when i was a kid and i thought it was the funniest shit ever, glad to say i grew up with smosh.
I still remember when you guys were the MVP of youtube. I miss those simpler times.
Been watching smosh for 13 years... im 24 now oop yall, dan and phil, gmm and gametheory shaped my personality
now bring back lunchtime with smosh
smosh is back so many memories
let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
the boys are BACK
so no food battle ?!?!? lol. so glad to see you guys are back.
LongBeachGRIFFY, please get him on
Assuming Anthony is going to continue with this channel as well, I'd love to see "I spent a day with the Smosh Squad" where the cast members that were there when Anthony left and had to weather all the negativity and backlash from the audience complaining about Old Smosh vs New Smosh and what that pressure and weirdness must have been like, but also how they've taken Smosh to a new place now
Bring back lunchtime w smosh🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I’m an old YouTube viewer. 2007. These guys were peak in the day. The moment it became a “bRaNd” was stupid. Smosh was just these two. Like Nigahiga. Just 2 guys. Not some dumb ass company. We have too much of that. The best content creators are just normal guys. Not business bullshit. That’s when you lost me and the original fans.
so good to see this. most wholesome moment 2023
Im crying. My heart is overjoyed and whelmed.
Two bros, sitting in a interview, 5 feet apart because they aren’t gay
I love that saying "smosh, eat and shit" lmaooo
all is right in the universe now
honestly this was really nice for me to watch and actually helped me with some of my own stuff going through
🌚🌚🌚
Hi Anthony i was wondering if u could do a video on "I spent a day with type 1 diabetics" I was recently diagnosed and your videos has helped my through this difficult time all i want is to spread awarness
This is such a wild moment in internet history and it's going to be crazy to have to explain to our kids. "Yeah, I remember witnessing the history of Smosh back before holigrams" or some shit like that
You bought Smosh back which is great but... how about tik tok? Probably would make more sense for your content
Omg i forgot they lived together! I just had flashbacks to lunchtime with smosh and the barbershop pole💈
my childhood <333
51:16 this part just makes my heart 🥺💕
I used to stay up late on school nights watching Smosh videos and struggle to stifle my laughter because I didn’t want my iPod touch to get taken away. I remember my first Smosh video when my best friend in 4th grade came over and showed me the food battle episodes. I look back on those times so so fondly and it’s so heartwarming to see them coming back together so organically :’) my inner child is healing
As someone else who's grown up while watching these two evolve as people, even if they hadn't decided to work together again, it just feels so wholesome and nice to see Anthony and Ian talk things out with each and even mend their friendship. No matter what happens with the content side, I hope you guys continue to work things out together!
i cant express how happy i am to see these two getting along together again
HELLL YEAA IAN ❤🎉 its beeeen sooooo long ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹
Here’s a poem I wrote a little while ago after spending time with old friends that I hadn’t seen in a while. This video reminded me of that time:  Together again After so many years Knowing that what we had Isn’t here But maybe it could be  Joy and mourning Laughter and silence Gratefulness and what ifs Coexist  Time stands still But the years have flown Where did the time go When we lived different lives And became different people  Maybe  I’ve found a new friend again
wouldnt the title technically be "I spent the month with Ian Hecox"?
I really do love how they're being very open with each other and not holding back any punches
🦧
Milk fanfic you say? 🤔
you have no idea how happy this makes me, i learned english by watching smosh videos when i was 7, food battles were my favorite ; so happy to see you guys together and learn more about what made ian and you, you :)
This was fascinating
When did Anthony turned gay ? Smh
Save ghetto smosh
YESSSSS WE GOT SMOSH BACK!!!  Missed the classic channel vids!
BRING IN THE FOOD BATTLES!!!
Someone will definitely make a movie about all this in a few years, the bromance between these two is insane haha
We need every "I spent a day with" ever.
This is broest bromance I've ever bro'd to
I was gonna come down here to comment something nice but instead I’m going to yell at both of you. For the love of God, why did you remind me about the milk fic? And in turn with the milk fic now I’m remembering stuff like the hamster fic. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors, but I also wish that your pillows are warm on both sides tonight.
I pirated the Smosh Movie in 2015
Love this!
I remember when anthony had that vlog channel with his ex, there was one video they had where anthony said something like "yeah me and ian don't hang out we're not friends" then joked about it right after, but I could tell it was true.
I bet Ian still didn’t watch this episode 🥳
omg i used to watch smosh back when i was in the 3rd grade and now seeing you both reunite again warms my heart . and my favorite series was food battles !!
This is another thing you guys are pioneering and sharing for others to learn from. Very excited for you guys! I hope it becomes everything you've always wanted it to be.
"where's Anthony"
Unpopular opinion: I love the Smosh movie and I still watch it at least once a year.  My sister and I showed it to her boyfriend and the last line of the movie sent him laughing for like 3 minutes. The best bit is the mailman, and the fact that they live on Gerard way
i can't wait for the Smosh to be back finally. I missed these guys.
The milk fic was about them?? FrFR?
NO WAY
rhett & link the original dads <3
YESSSSS
I love hearing Ian talk about the business of running a YouTube channel.
This is fuckin awesome. Smosh was a huuuuge part of my childhood. Love seein you guys together.
you should spend a day with moist critical
Now when is the true reunion of the century, I spent a day with DAXFLAME
I hope the smosh i remember is back icknow you guys did you vision maybe i grew up but the new content just semmed forced and like souless idk but im glad its back i remeber refreshhing a page waiting for foodbattle 2008
feels like the universe realigned THEY OWN SMOSH AGAIN!! 😍
it was all a canon event
theyre so kendall and roman oh my goooddddddd
THE BEST FRIENDS ARE TOGETHER AGAAAAAIN
Smosh was one of the few things growing up that i looked forward to, honestly even after anthony left, but i would really only watch when i saw ian, slowly i stoped watching becauze i really only liked anthony and ian, so when i didnt see them i didnt care, i followed anthony and his journy and i can say i love what hes done and where he is, im happy him and ian have found one another again and are starting over! I will be following this new journy and i will be doing so happily 😊
The style differences...
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZINGGG!! I love y’all so much hhhhhh 😭💕💕
Gooch queen
Heartwarming guys, grew up on old smosh, and appreciate the effort. More important is to see two friends come together, treasure that! Love u guys!
This is like a fever dream
can we have this with cold ones and joji
This is like if Daft Punk got together again all my fave OG youtubers are comin back 😊
This is re-living divorce parents trauma
man ion wanna put this out here but this seems a lil awkward
NICE VIDEO
I'll never forget the day as a middle schooler where I uploaded a "parody" of their "Dolls" video and they commented on it lol I truly thought I had made it and was ~one of the stars~ lmaoooo. These two were seriously my childhood 🥹
the style of comedy they're describing (the sketch kind that's very hard to do on YouTube without significant membership support) kinda reminds me of channels like Value Select
Now we just need the emo hair and bowl cut and we'll be squared away 🎉
Good
its so odd knowing they really didnt have the connection they always put up for branding purposes. kinda heart breaking but also so sweet that they can acknowledge and be honest about that as the care for eachother now again
The world is healing.
This is what happens when 2 white guys go to Therapy
Im close to tears seeing my most favorited youtubers reunite after so long and buy theit channel back. You guys made my childhood less hell as it could've been with you guys
But does this mean that Anthony's channel will die and he won't be doing these interviews anymore? Because I love these videos!
Now if y’all revive mail time with smosh it’ll be awesome x2
Please do more smosh libs
best week of my life is to learn this news!
I love how real this convo is. They don’t shy away from the fact that there were issues but they’ve also moved past it and can share with us
Wow. This was such a refreshing conversation. Best of luck to you guys in the future!
😭
this video gave me so much anxiety and honestly i couldnt tell you why
😢 awesome
they should start a podcast
This was not on my 2023 bingo but so glad to see you two back together
:3
Did this man really say do they even know who smashes God damn bro I lived of The food wars and all the stereotypes episodes they were legit one of my favorite things to watch as a kid U2 are some of the best content creators in the world I’ve been a big fan since I was a child hope you guys do well and have fun
they are SMOSH
ian kept up with anythonys content over all the years
Let's burn this to the ground 🥹🥹
You should do an “I spent a day with” the original Smosh Games cast!!!
I remember when I left I was so upset and I also figured he’d make a special appearance in the future this is WAY more then I can ask for 🥹🥹🥹
Bro spent hundreds of days with Ian
Ian and Anthony are still fine as hell! I had a crush on both of them as a kid
So. I got an ad for milk at the end of this video. Thanks.
thank you, i love you guys
Congrats guys, I really grew up with you, I saw Smosh to be born, took off, change, to break, transform and now I am so glad you are doing this together again. I mean what a hell of a ride. Wish you the best.
now kiss 😘
Here we are in the future…
Man spider is Back 🎉 😂❤
yay🤎
rhett and link are the best
I’m still friends with my childhood best friend and now we are closer than ever. We spent so much time together at one point we had a falling out. When we finally got back together it felt like apart of me was restored. I know that sounds dramatic. that’s how it felt.
“When we get recognized in public, someone is going to say “oh your SMOSH!” Lol literally what I said when I met Ian. I was too excited. Happy to see these two together again!
I have not seen a full minute of the video yet but I see the drip.
This means we’re in the right timeline
literally soul mates
I feel alot for Ian. That sudden push to leadership is stressful, Anthony is amazing for being true to himself. Also I've never had more respect for mythical. Those guys are still just people and I like it.
We’re getting old smosh back?
This type of content makes me feel 1. Old, 2. Hopeful. Seeing people who drifted apart for so many years come back together and rekindle their friendship and get to work together on something they love is so bittersweet.
WHAT YEAR IS IT!!!!!!
Hey can you make a “I spent a day with slimecicle” please he is one of my favorite YouTubers and I would really appreciate it,thank you😊❤
Ian 5 years ago and Ian now is such a wild difference 😮
I missed you guys
Now I’m just waiting for them to reconcile with Charlie. Assuming he hasn’t died of alcohol poisoning.
I think people dissed Anthony at that moment because people didnt know what is actually happening and suddenly Anthony quit. If you were being transparent with viewer, people will be more understanding
My old company was notorious for emailing end of day on Fridays major changes/issues with the company. A known trouble maker CEO of the rival company announced thats there was deals going on that they were selling. The company replied by emailing that was a false statement spread to  cause turmoil and to steal employees (which he has done previously) the following week they emailed effective immediately the company was sold to another. People left in masses due to the pettiness of them back tracking to then throw it back into our faces.
I actually thought the Smosh movie was pretty funny Ngl I actually liked it
Am I the only one that didn’t know there was some bad blood between them for a while
This sounds like you had an unnecessary complex relationship for no reason…  Like me and my dad
I spent an hour watching this and didn’t even realize
Tbh the movie was camp so I was into it. I also went to the live showing that yall showed up to so I was IN it.
Guys, this was so wholesome. Everyone needed this ❤
I AM SOOOO PROUD OF YOU GUYYYYYS
You should do I spent a day with Tomska! He's also an og youtuber who does (although nor much now a days) sketch comedy and I feel like he would have so much to say about how hard it has become to do. He has spoken about it in his channel but would love to see him to it in this format.
omg i remember when you guys first started, my older sister went to high school with you guys and we always had the i ❤smosh shirts
Smosh movies were great IMO. They should make another with the new cast
the Firetruck song made me fall in love with smosh. My friend showed me on itunes in 4th grade. I went home, bought it on itunes, and my mom took my phone away. No regrets.
Smosh: The Movie genuinely holds a special place in my heart. i remember being so excited when it came out, it was cheesy and a little cringe but i loved it. it’s hard to remember movies from the past but i still remember the arcane scene and what not and i think that says something. love you guys ❤
You should just do a fanfic skit series where you act out fanfics... to an extent lol
10:15 I am. I loved it. From memory….
this is like the beatles getting back together for me
The only one of your episodes Ian has seen all the way though… and only because he actually had to EXPERIENCE it 😂
smosh in hot ones is back on the table bois
I still love you old vids  my most fav old vid made from you two was “firetruck” 😂 it was great
Thanks!
I still watch your vids like 6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14 years ago
I wish you made those minuts vid again and say “shut up Fuck” all those bad world
oh man... I remember finding out you guys were from my city back in elementary school. You guys have been such a huge impact on my humor and honestly, personality. Thank you guys. This video its self feels so nostalgic.
Whats the milk?
BACK WITH THE BOYZ AGAIN
I still today sing  Boxman! Boxman! Boxman has a girlfriend!
This is the best news ever! I grew up watching all the OG smash and food battles and skits! :)
my childhood is healed watching these two
The beginning of Anthony’s channel was the best it was funny cuz it was cringe
Anthony is the best, I love boys who cry!
Maaannnn F#*ck Captain America & Bucky Barnes Bromance  Its Alll About That Anthony & Ian BroMance ❤❤😂😂🤙🤙
OKAY NOW WE NEED AN EPISODE OF LUNCHTIME WITH SMOSH:)
Like the movie tbh
For anyone who didn’t watch smosh this man was his partner
Yesss
I feel like yall should hang out more, yall seem like yall would mesh well together
ahhh!
I've got a Interview suggestion, A Medical Disorder called Lack of Interoception or Alexithymia as I have researched. (If a person's Interoception is not fully developed, they may find it difficult to manage their emotions and social interactions. If someone does not recognize the signals for an emotion, they are not able to respond to it. This can result in anger becoming rage, sadness becoming distress and so on.) (Yes I copied that from Google.) Some others also cannot or almost cannot feel internal senses like the rest of the world. I currently have this Disorder or some form of it and I have never once seen another individual with my condition throughout the entire world.   MY Interoception is my internal senses like Hunger, Thirst, Bladder, and even Internal pain.   Internal Pain - My Internal pain I cannot feel pain like I would on the outside. I remember getting hit by a truck in my neighborhood in sixth grade and I just got up, Totally fine. I just told the driver that I was fine and walked on home, Never telling my parents. The only reason my parents knew was because the truck driver followed me home to make sure I was alright. I didn't tell my parents because I did not think it was a big deal at the time but It definitely was. My ribs were hurt in the process and all I did was put some ice on it.  Bladder - With My Bladder sense I could not feel the urge to go and use the bathroom resulting in a lot of accidents when I was younger. With this information I was wearing diapers up until around 10 - 11 years of age. I was potty trained and I am doing good with bladder now but I still have accidents every once in awhile.  Thirst - I cannot feel Thirst, Making me not take care of my thirst "Meter", Resulting in semi-constant headaches due to lack of hydration and fluid going into my body. Also causing me to get sick a lot.  Hunger - Hunger is something I cannot deny feeling left out when everyone else is saying "I'm hungry", I tend to just eat at the same time as others as to not miss my food time. I have almost developed eating disorders multiple times due to my lack of the hunger sense. Hunger also makes food seem more delicious when you're hungry making you want to eat while as when you are full, the food seems more bland and disgusting making you not want to eat it. I am constantly stuck in this mindset of deciding whether I should eat or not, whether eating is good for me at the moment or whether I am even supposed to eat then. I tend to have others force me to eat when they have noticed I haven't eaten for a long time period. I never know when I should stop eating or when I should eat.  I'm currently 13 years old turning 14 soon and still struggling with this. I have other conditions such as Autism, OCD, and ADHD which add-on to my condition. I've had Lack of Interoception since I was born.
Where can I find the milk fan fictions?
Cyberspace celebrities.
Please do a "I spent a day with residential school survivors"  People need to hear these stories and understand just how recent these events were.
Classic… 25.6.23
Im in shock dude, literally i was waiting many years and here is, in the new anthony channel talking about smosh
I just short circuited hearing about the milk fic... noo not again
This deserves a whole biopic
This is great news
Smosh was my introduction into YouTube and youtubers' world i never thought this "video website" back in the day would have such hilariously funny videos (my community reacted to the internet when it first reached us negatively for sooo long it made me super scared and anxious abt it and while I under the dangers, that fear held me back from discovering a really beautiful thing for such a long time)   I'm so happy you guys are finally back ❤
I didn’t know fellow fans made fanfics back then of y’all LOL
If you love something, let it go. if it comes back, its yours.
I hope they keep improving their relationship and working through their emotional issues on their own. It's clear they needed to grow a lot to get to this point, but I get the sense that there's still some small amount resentment and compartmentalizing beneath the surface
SEEING YOU TWO TOGETHER IS DREAM COMES TRUE. CHEMISTRY AND MAGIC OF IAN AND ANTHONY BEING TOGETHER IS SOMETHING BEYOND AMAZING AND FANTASTIC
I enjoyed the smash movie
This is literally Wayne’s World, what happened to them, glad to see them back together
this era of youtube is great, that I wish the next thing could happen is for Dan and Phil to come back and do PINOF again or something :( Cuz like.... I feel like Smosh, Dan and Phil, (and whatever other classic youtubers) were kinda the pinnacle of youtube back then, where it was the best content. Not just people cutting and posting thousands of hours of Minecraft a year or other games.
Bruh antonys tattoos are so odd😂
I am 2 minutes in but I just wanna say I think about The Haunting at least twice  a month
This makes my heart happy! 💖 congratulations to the both of you!
Sad to see the same thing happening to FaZe
Smosh should join floatplane!!
idk if this would ever be seen but I would reallly like if there was actual subtitles rather than the auto-generated :(
i respect Ian so much for keeping with smosh all this time through everything
Also seeing smosh together again is SOGREAT OMG I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING😊
I totally understand needing to be distant in order to re connect. My BestF and I went thru the same thing (currently 21/22, know each other since 4th) in HS. We needed to be apart in order to reconnect. I’m so glad that her and I did and I wish the both of you best wishes on your new journey in friendship ❤️
so we getting a new season of smosh babies??
They made fun of him and Kal Il 🤷🏼‍♂️😂
Anthony is always dressed like a gansta and a fancy guy at the same time
Watching smosh in middle school is how my childhood bestie and I got close. We finally reconnected in our last semester of college this spring!
I haven't watched Smosh since 2013 I can finally start watching again
I remember watching Smosh underneath the covers with headphones on my old iPod when I was supposed to be sleeping and trying not to let my parents hear me laughing😂 it's great to see you guys together again, and back in charge of Smosh!  Return of the kings!
Are they bringing back Smosh and Order?
He has done this for years before
I'm so excited right now. I said a couple of weeks ago when they mentioned their was a surprise that Anthony would be coming back. This is more than I expected! So awesome, guys!
Haha I didn’t notice the old view on Anthony as the hot one, I always thought when I was younger Ian was the most attractive one haha!!
Just the fact that I grew up watching smosh as the mentioned 'kid' in the video and now I'm an adult hits different.. it's really amazing to both of these guys evolve and  honestly I got emotional about it..
Imagine how different the internet would be if Ian/Anthony didn’t go to school that day
It is SO good to have you guys back, cant wait to see the future of smosh. I know smosh is in good hands with you two
Dude I was there when you released that old content back then what an ERA!!! Loved your stuff back then. I still yell HOLY BURRITO! no one understands the inside joke. haha
You guys were a big part of me and a couple of my friends childhood. We're all in our early to mid twenties now. I'm glad to hear you guys are doing great now!
this wasn't anthony spending a day with ian. It was us spending a day with two old friends, called Smosh
I used to watch Smosh a decent amount when I was younger. Probably 5th-6th grade? Could be wrong but I have somewhat clear P.O. Box memories, haha. Now I'm 22 and I didn't really follow Smosh's brand over the years, but I'm glad to see these two working together again! This video was super interesting. Will definitely follow how this goes, best of luck to them both!
"We've never even expressed these emotions to each other, so this is great" "I still won't" is so Schmidt and Nick from New Girl
Just how much did it cost for them to buy Smosh back? Has that amount been disclosed anywhere yet?
Growing up watching Ian and Anthony, seeing them go their separate ways, and now reuniting has been such a wild ride. I'm glad you two have hammered out your differences and can now work together again. It's a beautiful thing.
I find it funny that Anthony was considered the hot one, because Ian is genuinely good looking as well (… now, that he lost the bowl cut, haha).
Smosh the movie is a cinematic masterpiece in my mind and I'll never be convinced otherwise
4 point 7 million viewed this?!? That's insane!!! Even VSauce didn't get that many. And only FOUR days????
I awlays wondered what a collab between these two would be like🔥
Ian says "like" every 3 words. Needs to learn how to talk like a real person not a 15 year old teen.
this video has totally changed how I perceive Ian it’s really weird, nothing bad of course it’s just different to how I saw him before
anyone else remember fb first lil emojis and if you : putnam : ian's face would show up lol
anthony joining smosh was NOT on my 2023 bingo card
wow i am in shock. i am now 18 i was watching yall in middle school
this was so heartwarming
im glad things worked out of you all after all you both have been through
This is so fucking exciting! I loved smosh growing up but I fell off after high school.  I think y'all made a good choice to make sure not to go back to the old bits, because I think that would for sure alienate the younger folks. I'm excited to see the new content you guys make together!
Its funny to me, I found smosh through vlogs Anthony did with his ex-fiance. So I already enjoyed Anthony and his content. Then I found out Anthony did content in smosh games. The game bangs, the gta smosh, why I’m single. All of those were my go to content to watch. Now that its coming full circle of me enjoying Anthony’s content and getting into smosh from him again.
22:23, Refused song Tannhausser. Damn, Anthony and Ian got good taste on punk songs. Comfy interview guys.
I saw another comment saying that Anthony was more of an emotional thinker and Ian was more logical, and I just thought like, that really checks out! Dynamic duo
I’m one of the people who hasn’t really watched Smosh after Anthony left and really do enjoy how he’s developed his channel into what it is now. I appreciate that he just has discussions and asks open ended questions with people that are often not highlighted in the media.   It kinda rubbed me the wrong way when they talked about how “cringe” Anthony was after he left smosh but not how smosh became so cringey with some of the series they have. I understand why Anthony left and I’m interested to see how Smosh evolves now as Anthony and Ian bought it back.
I feel like the world is healed now that they own SMOSH again.
1:11:25 Damn that hit sooo hard and the best thing a person could hear from his bestfriend.
I should message some old friends
Watched a ton of Smosh as a kid but...what the fuck is the Milk fanfic
Are we gonna get another Boxman!??
Thank you for doing this! Glad to say I’ve been there since the original Pokémon parody and Dolls, and glad to hear everything that went on behind the scenes
Tbh I fucking loved the movie when I was a kid
I’ve been waiting
this is like a right and left brain coming back together again after years for the sole purpose of comedy. Everything they went through in their careers and personal lives at the exact time they happened directed them on this path and it ended up with them making content again. Two of Youtube’s actual Legends are back and still going strong together and they own 100% of what they are doing, Unreal.
i’ll never forget growing up on smosh from age like 10-13 and then seeing them host a cartoon animated worse than rick and morty about how getting your period is funny. even middle school me knew something weird was happening (not that periods are weird but that the channel’s branding/company buyout stuff shifted it)
You can tell that they are genuinely excited that they are doing this
1:02:48 yeah about the nostalgia thing. I think they could definitely do little bits like anthony eating a banana or talking about emo hairstyles or like ian wearing diapers or having a dog named sparky
this is wholesome
Just want to say, Ian said the word like 30 times in three minutes, averaging a like to like ratio of 10 likes per minute, which you could make the like to like to like ratio of an average usage of like, 2 times per sentence, with 10 likes in a minute for a total of three minutes (this was conducted from 57:39-1:00:39
Things like this make getting older seem okay.
Anthony leaving Smosh needed to happen, it was a canon event.  I’m glad he’s back though and that they own Smosh again
Really, a serious suggestion, you should go to therapy together. It could be really nice and help you maintain your business/friendship
*on objectifying Anthony/him being the “hot one”* Defy f*cked Anthony? Well what was he wearing?
Ian’s still processing this, isn’t he?
Awesome video, so stoked for this news, great interview, can’t wait to see the new content with you guys !
1:11:37-1:11:41 best moment
they are the true definition of if you love something set it free, if it comes back it was meant to be
If you love something,  let it go.  If it comes back it was truly yours... or something like that
Brought back so many memories, love you guys
The regrets caught up to them.
Just when I thought I couldn’t love Rhett and Link more 🥺
Damn, can't believe that time goes fast! I watched these guys since I was in 2nd grade back in 2007. And now seeing them reunited awakes my inner child, thank you smosh for being a part of my childhood! ❤
Dixon Cider was no mistake though me bobs
yay
I’ve been a smosh fan from literally the beginning of time and I’m fangirling so hard
fuck yeah dude
SMOSH THE MOVIE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVOURITE MOVIE EVER SINCE IT CAME OUT I WAS IN GRADE 5 AT THE TIME LMAO
Holy shit this is gonna be a reset for the culture
omg please spend a day with rhett and link together 🤍🤍
If Food Battle comes back, that would be epic
Smosh back together is the best news I've heard this year
I think they have to go big. No more studio shoots. Do it in the wild. If you are familiar with korean shows like running man that would be fun. Or something like a game of tag or hide and seek but in a bigger scale.
Commented already but real talk, hearing Anthony talk about letting go of that resentment and anger is a great lesson. So happy to see you two both in better places, wish you all the best!
I'm extremely happy to see my childhood stars come back.
Smosh definitely inspired a ton of my content
spend a day with SML
IAN YOU OWN SMOSH AGAIN (WHATEVER THAT IS)
I still watch the smosh movie, I thought it was funny :/
Respect the OGs that laid the foundation of this multi billion website
I enjoyed the movie 😂
omg this feels like my parents got back together lmfao 😂🥺 love you guys ❤
Return of the king
Ever since I had real internet access and was able to go on YT you guys were the best channel out there for me. I was about 9 years old then, I’m 23 now and seeing this amazing connection between you guys again is just astounding. When you guys grew apart and Anthony left I kind of went off to Rhett and Link and when I heard that news about them taking over ownership I knew it was heading in the right direction. Even watching Anthony’s own Interviews we’re knowledgeable and great to me. Up until today, I’m grateful and happy to be to see this again and thankful to eventually be a member🙏🔥
i always think about that old prank anthony did to ian about leaving smosh to be a model.. that sell out bit just hit  excited to see what they do
This healed a part of me. I wasn’t watching smosh by the time Anthony left honestly but it was sad bc I had heard it wasn’t very amicable. Followed Anthony eventually on YouTube, never watched most new smosh stuff. I bet this will be awesome. Happy for them ❤️ I still randomly think of boxman here and there. That shit was my jam
I knew this was going to happen one day but never actually thought it would happen like this. My childhood is back with Ian and Anthony reuniting!
Ian and Anthony feels like yin and yang! I don't want to bring mbti into this but this duo gives off powerful enfj (Anthony) and intp (Ian) vibes, no wonder why Anthony's hyperfocusing, dialling in and selection, and Ian's generation of quick loose random ideas work so well.
THE ENDING BRO 😂😂😂
In some weird ways, without Anthony Padilla leaving Smosh and creating this (which is great in its own ways) we wouldn't have this great video of two friends being open with each other in public about their struggles, and now re-owning Smosh. Such a better example for people than any Alpha/Beta/Sigma/Tate/Rogan bullshit! Many parallels with CollegeHumor. Good luck!
does anthony just have lines as tattoos or
First channel I followed on YouTube when I discovered the Mortal Kombat video in 2005! Followed them until 2018! Pumped!
I was that child watching smosh. Now I’m an adult and I love it more.
omg bring back food battles 😭😭😭
wth i saw a membership blocked video the exact same as this one?
Why when they said jokes that wouldn't be allowed on YouTube anymore my brain went 🎵 Dixson Cider 🎵
anthony returning woo righto wrap up the where's anthony memes
I just want to say that i was there for smosh in the beginning. im talking 2009 is when i first saw smosh. I was seven.
Are we not gonna talk about how Ian looks like a porn producer in this?
Rhett and link realized that the right thing to do was to let smosh be smosh. Finally...
Thank you so much for making this video, it explains so much and I cannot wait to see the era and next chapter of SMOSH 😊
Really really appreciate this video because in some ways it wasn't just a video spending time with Ian, but also a video of Anthony spending time with himself. Both of them, integral to each others' journey, now both healing with this heart to heart. It really feels like they're both laying themselves the most bare they've ever been. If something like this doesn't merit greatness, then nothing will. It's two people who have influenced one another coming together once more after many hardships to bring back the color to something that once lost it. It isn't just a case study about two friends making lightning in a bottle like Smosh, but also another case study of many on how a person can grow from adversity and become better versions of themselves with time and effort. There's no doubt about it, the best is yet to come.
43:25 Can I just say that while I hate that social pressures forced these identities on these two, I love how the two of them equally value "Funny" over "Hot." It's kind of wholesome in a weird non-conforming way. It feels like a more sincere version of the Daniel Radcliffe bit where he's upset his friend can do a hand stand.
Dude this was an early birthday gift to me. Ian and Anthony were THE first people I spent time watching growing up and sneaking off late at night to watch after school and I just turned 24. The most loveable part about it all was the connection between two friends goofing around doing all the fun stuff I wished I could have done with someone. It wasn't even about the production or the skits necessarily which were good but it's that relationship that I feel like made people fall in love with it and wow I don't care where this all goes it's just awesome seeing these two reconnect and have a heart to heart, much love to them both.
I Spent a Day With Ben Shapiro. Now that would be entertaining.
Guys, whenever you start to feel "burnt out" again, remember this: millions of people work a soulless 9 to 5 every single day for a boss who hates them, with colleagues who are not their friends. And that's not getting into the money profit/question
54:06 I cant wait!
I was 8 when I found smosh (I’m now 20), was one of my favourite YouTube channels, I will admit I stopped watching after Anthony left, but seeing that they bought smosh back I almost cried, seeing them reunite and bring back one of the best channels on YouTube back to how it used to be, just them, I’m so happy Anthony’s back and I genuinely can’t wait to see how it goes
Seeing “co founder & co owner” made me so happy
These 2 mfkers should fight in the undercard for Elon vs Musk😂😂😂
I’m so freggin hyped for the skits
0:14 - that photo man, everything these guys do is funny
😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤❤ I love u guys so much
I am so excited for this 😭❤️ Can’t express how happy I am for them and this opportunity!! Gonna start watching smosh again for the first time in a lot of years 🙌
I wanna know what the milk fanfic is 👀
just realized ur fireplace is off center
everyone and there grandmas were suggested this video
Gotta bring back the shut up intro
I'm pretty excited to see the new sketches, been here for the last 10 years or more and was sad to see you guys split up
It's so nice to see them back again
I was one of your fan base that grew up watching you, im the same age as you two, and i was one of those who enjoyed the movie haha. Youre right Ian, smosh is bigger then just the two of you, its honestly a big deal for me to see you two together again haha.
It's funny how me and my friends started talking about smosh after over decade later when we never did before. And suddenly all these announcements of you guys being back started to roll in! I'ts like it was meant to be and everyone could feel it.
I was part of the batch of kids that watched Smosh and Fred :D Then also the daily vlogs🤣
my big cousin really loved you guys when we were kids. ngl, i pretended to love you too to seem cool. hes been gone for a while now, but i've grown to really appreciate these silly videos of you two together. i'm sure he'd be ecstatic too
Esto si es una pareja perfecta  this is a perfect courtship
Me and my brother used to watch Smosh everyday after school like 15 years ago, we stopped after more and more cast was brought into the channel. They are awesome and passionate people, but the channel kind of lost the original style after that. Nothing wrong with the wonderful crews, it's just the new content didn't seem to sparkle that humor I seek anymore. but now i feel like smosh is finally whole again! I'm beyond happy. Cannot wait to watch all the overly dramatic sketches! It's so good to see they both grew as a person and find their friendship back
3:21 *sees the sloth.  WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!!
Food Battle 2023
Guys, who is still waiting for new episodes of the Pokemon in real life series like me?
oh shitt with anthony back on smosh time to hit the resubscribe button, when he left i stayed for a few with smosh but unsubbed once it started being not funny anymore, i went backj to the smosh channekl and saw the update and it made me laugh like it used to when i was kid when ian's mom came bursting thru and pushing them out and telling to spend a day with someone loll. now that is the smosh i remember and love
I will forever say, that glory has been brought back to YouTube since we found out you guys bought smosh back💅✨
I need foodbattle 2023
I hate the term "it’s just business, don’t take it personal" because business IS personal.
Now they just gotta get their old hairstyles back and it’ll all be like nothing ever happened
yay og smosh is resurrected 🥺
My GAHD I love how genuine y’all are in this makes me love y’all more
"We own Smosh again"  Tears are fludding! Smosh was nothing without this duo. I have high hopes for a better Smosh!
So fair if the CHARACTERS Ian and Anthony grow together with the REAL Ian and Anthony
this is a f*cking moment of youtube
Smosh was one of the few channels I watched religiously back in like 2012. I think it’s so dope that you guys bought it back and want to get back to your old roots in a way.
I didn’t realise it, but I needed this video
I remember watching Chinese Backstreet Boys, and then Smosh uploaded the Power Rangers Theme. Both videos were on the front page, and I use to watch them over, and over. I would have been 8 years old in 2005, and these simple videos made me so happy. :'-)
R u gonna stop making vids in this channel then?
I hope you still have time to do this channel even tho im happy with ya smosh return i enjoy your unique face2face YouTube interview.
Almost cried watching this it’s so beautiful
love how things always work out, truly inspiring and nostalgic for me who watched smosh when i was like 10
Wait Ian is so wholesome just always positive 😭😭😭
Gimme one more “SHUT UP” outro for my dopamine 👀😂
When anthony started tearing up i started crying 😭
Wait are these done???? Is Anthony not going to interview people??
DO FOOD BATTLE 2023!!!
Ohhh I was a babyyyy just born 2006 and still knew about Amish growing up and it’s coming back yo me
@1:11:58 Im now more convinced this is could be an excessively elaborate "Lets Do This" bit, and the reveal is going to be silly.
I can't believe they mentioned the milk fanfics, oh my 😭💀
so now that they own smosh again can we get some more food battles
I wish Ian can bring back Ian is board vlog
whoa that's wild...
My name is Marcos been watching you sense I was 9 I’m 20 I love you both when I was in jail me and my celly were singing tomahawk chop is my death blow like freaks
Omg I’m sooooo excited you guys are reuniting!!! 🥹 ❤️
I never got into "old Smosh" back in the day, but having found both this channel and the various Smosh channels in the past year I am so excited to see this friendship coming back together. I went on a similar journey with my best friend from high school, we didn't have a falling out but just went in very different directions after high school and drifted apart. I was pretty resigned to the idea that we just weren't going to be friends anymore, as sad as that was. Six years later, she randomly reached out to me saying that she had been thinking about me and realizing how much she missed our friendship, and we started talking again and now four years later are closer than we've ever been before. I honestly believe that we needed to be apart for some time to really figure ourselves out, sometimes you can go through those transitions with current friends but other times you need room from them to grow, while still recognizing that further on that friendship may be able to come back around. I'm so glad to see that you two have reconnected and are excited to move forward at Smosh together again. I can't wait to see what you do!
Is it wrong that this is the first time I've ever heard of SMOSH😂
Ian still got that Smosh humor
Love this ! And I’m proud of the progress…but Ian is being a reaL REAL champ for being positive and letting Anthony not look bad when they recapping events
Missed you two for real.
🌚🌚🌚
i didnt watch smosh a lot during the era of when youtube was blowing up, but i can clearly see the separation of the original creators. that Anthony went into his creative direction and Ian went into his philosophical self-discovery
I was 7 when I discovered smosh! I used to literally replay teleporting fat guy and food fight lol 🤣🤣
I feel like this healed my inner child
I stopped watching Smosh after Anthony left. I’ve been a fan since the beginning and it really felt like a shift had happened. I’m so happy things are working out for the better now. Smosh was my favorite channel growing up and I can’t for it to be my favorite again
WOW is the only thing that can come out of me after watching this video. I was 10 yo when I saw my first ever SMOSH video… I am 23 now and I’m finally getting answered all the questions I had.  I love y’all<3
Ian can still do the hunch after all this time 1:10:36
Genuinely one of the most heartwarming videos I’ve seen, you guys deserve the best
It wasn't for kids and now those kids are older and there watching this video
Dudes, this is so cool
NOT Y'ALL BRINGING UP THE MILK FIC IN 2023
Such a flex to introduce yourself using an actual news clip
I dont understand why I am so wrapped up in this reunion.  I have no connection to old smosh.  I barely have a connection to new smosh.   But this is great.
saw your guys panel at vidcon 2023. not even the longest fan, just like yoru work of what ive found. Didnt even figure out who you guys were until like 1 and a half years ago, but you guys are awesome, and thanks 4 being here.
the membership option makes a ton of sense because i met my best friend of over a decade because we found out we had both been watching smosh outtakes
after all these years Anthony's still emo and well, Ian turned into a fucking pimp version of his old self so that's pretty cool
we need to make sure smosh do well and transcend their peak
I remember watching the smosh with my cousin and imitating the plot of the sketches hahahaha, it feels a little weird now knowing that your friendship in that time was... complicated, he and i used to say we had a friendship like that, but now that im older i can see why it happened, im glad you two talked, i love both of you <3
Please don't let this friendship be only for the screen. <3
I would love to see them recreate some of the classics. Left Handed!
i absolutely loved smosh back in the day. but it wasnt the same after anthony left.
Bring back box man plz
Es como ver a los dioses regresar al olimpo.
yay :D
You guys were my childhood, and the reason I started making videos as a kid. I remember the Pokémon theme. Hopefully, this is a new beginning.
ohhh nooo, i remember reading the milk fanfic. poor ian lmaooo
I remember watching smosh the movie and liking it lol
you can tell anthony functions more through his emotions and ian is more logic minded
I still remember you two putting stickers on the shirt packages in goofy ways and just seeming so happy ❤ you were both a huge reason I made sketches as a kid. Thank you.
Super
you should interview Jonathan Davis
It’s the thumbs up for me lmaoooo
I'm so glad they are very self actualized about all of this. excited to see more of smosh!
Its really sad what all happened with smosh but all of that made it to where they can try again with their own funding and more passion. A blessing in disguise if you will. It could've ended after defy for good but it all worked out in the end. My mom always tells me that sometimes things end to make way for better things and this seems to be one of those cases.
One if the best creators on youtube of all time and lovong legends. You created a lot of amazing content. Still miss the old ian is bored
not even joking, watching smosh when i was 12 helped me learn english as a second language, and im so glad to see you guys reunited again, made me feel just like when i used to watch smosh 11 years ago
Memories brought to life once more 🥹
If they make content like they did back in the day I will become a member immediately
Dam this just amazing collab, you guys were and probably still the best content creator on YouTube
When the world needed them most they came together again
This emotional vulnerability looks to be crucial to the longevity of your newfound friendship! I would love to see Ian on here again to just talk about how you both are doing (and FEELING!) in your new reincarnation of Smosh. Very happy for you both!
The smosh process is pretty much Ian spewing eldritch text and Anthony translating it for mortal ears to understand
Truly brothers from another mother.
holy fuck cant believe their back baby
Dude, at 41:59 I can feel Ian sadness on not being able( or not wanting yet) to fully open emotionally to Anthony. The "I still won't" felt like said with pain... hope they can fully heal and open to each other because after all, after smosh, they were and i hope they will be friends.
looks like im resubscribing to SMOSH again !!!!
We need an Ear Biscuits episode with you four.
This is an hour long. No wonder Ian doesn’t watch these. Lmaoo  Fr though, I’m glad they’re finally back together. Love these two.
It makes me wanna cry if youve gotten into the recent smosh (i actually really like shayne topp p funny guy) i noticed in the last couple years ian looks like he was dying on the inside he looks so full of life now its insane
i really feel for ian having to deal with all of that on his own, and especially with his only way of being able to cope was turning his emotions off :( that’s rough but i’m so glad they’ve circled back around and have grown to be able to communicate better with one another. it’s truly inspiring and i’m so happy for them
to be honest i always thought they were both hot and funny
This makes me so beyond happy 🥹. I first started watching Smosh at the very beginning. I grew up right along with you guys. It was heartbreaking when it “ended” but as you said this needed to happen exactly as it did. This whole video was so beautiful, raw, and real. I definitely teared up a little bit. I’m so excited for you both and so eager to see what’s in store, I immediately subscribed to join and support you guys, I’m rooting for you 🩷🩷
Food battle
Seeing two old friends come back together like this is so heartwarming 🥹
Like
Its hard to explain how truly cathartic this is. It makes me happy to see how you both have come back from your own independent journeys as people to create something new. I'm excited for the future of smosh especially as someone who has enjoyed the content from when I myself was in high-school.  Its an inexplicable pride in both of you as well as excitement.  Congrats on re-aquiring your channel and I look forward to many more laughs (and tears in this case) with both of your creative abilities.
You know this is insanely serious when none of them are openly joking  They are just talking
No one can buy Smosh, you two Are Smosh! we would of watched you wherever and whatever your content were/was! Cant wait to see what you will do next!
Sactown legends
Brings me tears and joy. Found out about them when I was a freshmen around 2011. Would always watch their videos. 10 years ago damn I'm getting old
This is a beautiful journey because it led you back to each other ❤️ one of most genuine and heart warming stories on YouTube for me
I remember finding out what YouTube was because the neighborhood kid invited me over, and showed me the pokemon lip sync
Happy for you guys
2000s childhood comedy duo, bad ending: Drake & Josh  2000s childhood comedy duo, good ending: Ian and Anthony
I started crying when anthony started crying
This is genuinely such an incredible conversation. So much vulnerability, self reflection, growth and work. Makes me tear up even though I missed the smosh train at the time it’s just so beautiful to see two ppl coming together again. Thank god for the women in our lives FRFR.
really really good stuff going on here guys!! can't wait to see what's coming <3 but hey uh why did y'all have to remind me of a. the milk fic and b. blue waffle Right at the very end there :///
Who is diana?
not the milk fic 😭😭😭
I am still watching your older videos - im an adult so xD
1:10:36 THE GAP HUG!!!
This almost feels like watching Paul McCartney and John Lennon talking to each other, such harsh times that drove them apart but deep down an inseparable connection that no one could imitate. Love you Ian and Anthony! Can't wait to see what's next!
The recognizing in public. I think y'all underestimate what Anthony made. I never knew Anthony had anything to do with Smosh until this video
NOOOO NOT THE MILK FIC
I started watching smosh when I was literally 5 years old. I’m so glad you guys have grown and are happier now and are doing what you love. It’s so cool to see you guys rekindle your love for smosh/old skits. Love old and new smosh and super excited for this new era. Wish you all the best. (I watched smosh when I was SO young so I probably won’t remember old jokes at all lmao)
I don't know, it feels like everything is alright with the world again.  Ian and Anthony are a dyad that isn't easily broken.
I really love Anthony's style and his jewelry.
I knew this day would come, I've been binge watching Anthony's videos in this channel and I was hoping Ian would be included in his videos. I can't still believe this is happening, it's like my inner child restored. ;-) I miss Smosh so much
bless these legends lives 🌅☝️🐐🐐🥃
Glad to have you guys back ❤
Wow this really makes me miss my ex
Now do coldones
For the longest time I hoped you two were still friends. I'm glad you two can work together again!
1:12 this makes Smosh look older than they were
Do you think Ian will watch this episode?   Nah, waaaay too long 😅
I couldn't keep my eyes off Ian's cuban shirt/necklace combo.
I didn't think the silly people from the videos I watched in middle school would make me cry as a full grown adult.
this must have been the most theraputic dialogue between these two that could have happened
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This friendship is the only proof that our timeline is healing
Bring back the pink donut
Esto me alegra el alma loco
This type of shit would make a great like biography book or movie. Kinda like inspirational type shit
I was never into YT back in the day, and I’m a bit older too, but I look forward to seeing what you guys do together. Get energy. I’ll be watching. 😊
What was the song Anthony and Ian listen to when they went separate ways? I wanna hear it now 😭
I'm telling you, one day, Hollywood will make a Smosh biopic. WIth all the ups and downs and the satisfying conclusion, it'd be perfect
They should go back in time to their older selves Emo hair, bowl cut, and all and tell them to never let any company buy them out that would be a good skit
This episode makes me feel old lol I remember when smosh first started back in high school lmao I’m now 31
it’s really nice to see anthony and ian talk so maturely, even after seeing the countless videos of them being teenagers and joking around and having fun, it feels like they really found a good connection through Smosh. ian and anthony really deserve to have Smosh as their own again.
I will definitely give you guys my money
Mail time with smosh and Lunch time with smosh are something that will live with me forever 😭
i’m fkn cryin in the club rn that ending
It doesn't comprehend to me that there are so many people that watch Anthony that don't know Smosh ever existed
it's insane that we got to see the deal close during the interview.  I love it
legends :)
I found smosh when I was 13 and I learnt English partially through it - now I'm 23 and I've gotten a spouse that I speak with in English daily because we've got different native languages. I still remember asking my older brother ''what's a tommahak'' when you released the assassins creed 3 song and him answering vaguely because he didn't quite know either. I'm very happy you've been able to mend your relationship as friends
...I am not a member, and wouldn't you know Youtube gives me no ads anyway. let's go YT+
The drip in this video is off the charts
This whole video made me think of therapy, but it’s between two therapists
i’d watch a new smosh movie where it’s a documentary from everyone’s perspective as well
i wanna remind you two that if you feel like quitting, don't be afraid to do what you want.  if you lose passion or creative juice, leave it as it is.  quality over quantity.  can't wait to see where you guys go :)
like it or not, ur guys' fate seems to be intertwined
This was really excellent. Thank you.
the last minute of anthony and ian fucking around gave me instant tears 🥹 it’s good for the soul lol i’m so fucking happy to have you both back
My childhood is healed
Who's gonna tell Anthony that he should not go back to smosh? Ian is toxic af
Ian sounds like such a bore.
Pls bring back lunchtime with Smosh
the best 1 hour and 13 minutes of my life well spent
their growth and dialogue together is so beautiful (´༎ຶ ͜ʖ ༎ຶ `)♡
i’m less than 20 minutes in and i’m already so impressed at the amazing change in both of you, i noticed the same when anthony made this channel, there was a marked change in emotional maturity and i love to see that again. it seems like the break from each other was good for you guys. i’m very happy for you both
I got really sweet wholesome bromance energy from them both. They grew up in an age of men being discouraged to talk about their feelings and now it's a better platform for it. Happy that they rekindled this relationship.
So when is the Smosh movie reboot?
Do my eyes deceive me anthony and ian in the same room having a conversation 😮
I haven't watched a Smosh video in probably 6-7 years but this got me excited to try it again
Take a shot when ian says "like"
I want to know if Boxman will be returning and running in the next presidential election
i remember watching classic smosh, those food battles and all that with my brother on my xbox 360. Smosh being back is crazy
I first found smosh as an 8 year old boy looking for the lady who sings the “sittin on the toilet” meme from wayyy back. When a suggested video caught my eye. “Stuck in the toilet” curious, i clicked it with my 6 year old brother. We couldnt stop laughing. From stuck in the toilet to bot best friend. From food battle 2011 to if video games were real. We binged smosh all day long. That was 10 years ago and i am now 18, in college and with the same sense of humor. What makes me really happy is that now this 8 year old boy can help fund the videos of one of his favorite channels. And I 100% will do so.
This is really a good video I havent see you guys together a very long time I been watching you guys between nigahiga, pewdiepie and some other lets play game and it was really awesome. You guys rock and one of my top favorite youtuber I ever seen back when I was in highschool. Also there one thing I would like to say and im gonna go base as possible.......     Pink frosted sprinkle donut beat any food 😂
So with going back to smosh roots.... when are we gonna bring back the bowl hair cut??
This was such a heartwarming interview! Omg! 🥰
Im so happy for both of you. Im glad the reunion is on your terms. Im excited to see whats next whatever this may be
Sooooo.... food wars 2023? :D
The one that stayed to grasp onto the remaining bits of what was left of their passion and the one that wanted to restart and find their own passion once again. It’s pretty crazy to see two extreme paths just happening right in front of our eyes. Two besties who stayed true to what they felt was right, even if they had to separate.  It’s crazy to see how much has changed, how much they’ve grown and honestly, i feel like this will work (no jinxing!) this will be their new passion!
Smosh getting back together right now is a canon event
will there be food battle 2023?
I was 14 when the movie came out. I loved every minute of it.
I never thought this would happen but it's amazing
Anthony has done soooo much to grow himself and his emotions. It’s so admirable and his sensitivity is so refreshing to see. Well done, and congrats on gaining back what was always yours!! 🎉
can’t wait to see what the future holds for you guys
This is such an interesting thing to see as someone who watched classic SMOSH as a 6 year old and now is watching this video as a 15 year old. It is really cool to see you guys be honest about what happened and what went wrong. It is like the closure of a chapter that I didn't realize I was needing.
What and where is this Ian and Anthony Smosh fan fiction involving milk? I need to know what this is about.
Ah yes the fanfictions I can see it now 🧘🏻‍♀️
it’s absolutely amazing seeing you two together after all these years. truly heartwarming <3
I'm so happy to see you together again
❤
One minute in and I'm already tearing up. Congrats on getting Smosh back, I'm so so happy for you guys
This has probably been the best video I've watched in the last year.  Thanks guys <3
I was in a bad place when i first found Smosh (although I already was a grown ass adult) but your sense of humor helped me to feel not so down in the dumps. I was very upset when you guys split up so when I saw the announcement that you guys have taken control again i was thrilled! Best of luck to you guys!
I know this is gonna sound stupid, but the video that has stuck with me the most (idk why) is molester moon 😶
This entire video is so healing... I'm so glad you both chose to share this discussion with us. I hope you feel yourselves healing as well. I'm very glad you found each other again, yours is a friendship so few get the experience!
food battles?
ian has said "like" at least 1000 times holy scheit
I LOVE THIS ERA OMG 😭
I wanna find that milk fanfic…I’m now curious
I am watching all of the ads so you can get money. Happy old smosh is back!
Drink every time Ian says “like” 😅
I'm literally crying. They've come a long way and I'm so proud of both of them.
This makes me feel old, yet I might have to watch some old stuff
i can tell right away that ian is 100% about loyalty, to a fault, and anthony is 100% about being genuine, even if it does hinder him sometimes
Now we need a movie about smosh much like the social network
Started watching Smosh when I was ten years old with my cousins, barely even knew what internet was then and now its 18 years later and the boys are back at it  :')
I can feel the world healing
This is the best thing ghat has ever happened to the internet.
I was 8 when my sister showed me the stranded video & we kept watching smosh for years (even tho our parents would ground us for watching lol)
even after anthony left smosh, i still loved both of them and i could feel that anthony needed to become his own person.. i felt like i grew up with you guys and I watched glam&gore so seeing anthony get with mykie was literally so amazing! i love what smosh has become and all the new cast members and i cant wait to see what ian and anthony do next!! this really warmed my heart to watch <3
The universe has corrected itself
I bet Ian is not gonna watch this video.
THIS IS CRAZY MY SIXTH GRADE SELF IS CRYING
Smosh was the first channel I subscribed in yt circa 2006? We probably watched the pokemon video like 1000 times with my friends. I’m genuinely very happy for you two. Bests of luck in this new chapter of your lives.
Please bring back 2010s Smosh, please don’t make it “modernised” or grown up
Smosh was a gigantic influence on my youth, and helped me create friendships with so many people in the community. I’m glad to see you two back together, and will be tuning in back to see some Smosh (:
My heart is so happy rn :)
i love this video and I'm so glad they're finally back togetehr as a team!! But I feel like Anthony seems so much more open emotionally and is just genuinely happy to be working with Ian again as friends/partners. But Ian is still holding back and sees all of this primarily as a business relationship. Not bad but they're still looking at this very differently and I hope they keep talking to figure things out more.
This made my inner child happy as hell
I hope to see a finale to the pokemon in real life series
1:10:53
The internet has stopped
Love to see Smosh come back together! I just hope that Anthony brings the vibe from his channel and interview-style videos to Smosh instead of falling back into what Smosh originally was. You both have grown and so has your audience over the years and I love to see the comedy sketches but it could be a lot more too.
Uhmm. Ian seems cold to this whole interaction. But that could be me being an empath and relating to Anthony more.
Just realized that this set is an actual place with a real background and not just like a screen print lol
I feel so silly right now. I started watching smosh about a year ago so I’ve always said that I don’t really know old smosh, I didn’t think I had ever seen one. But the “go anthonymon!” totally unlocked a hidden memory of mine from middle school 😂 ❤smosh forever!❤
Will food battles come back ??
Yippee now bring back smosh summer games thx!
Love thie
I still remember being 14 watching “Ian is Bored” episodes on what’s now known as the “smosh pit” channel.  So glad they’re back together.
I"m so thrilled to see y'all back, and I'll say it on every channel.  Let's burn this mother down, boys! <3
Did everyone forget that one smosh show like i loved it so much
Do you both understand how much this means to a lot of people. I almost cried hearing you both be so open about your past and differences. So glad and excited to see you both back together.
this is healing my inner child
I didn't realize that smosh has existed for 17.5 years
i just wanna say that everyone in this comment section was like 10-12 years old when they found smosh and now are working adults. me too. this could not be more of a phenomenal event for an entire community of internet kids <3
not the milk fic
Why did I forget Anthony was apart of Smosh lmao I was like ooh he's going to talk to Smosh. I guess it's because I never liked Smosh. It makes me nostalgic, though, because I've always seen them on YouTube since my brother showed me the site in early 06/late 05 I can't remember
Did not know the set was in his home cool
It's crazy, for a split second I saw the thumbnail and was like, "what an odd pick," then I remembered all of smosh because it's been so long
You can tell the happy and the exited that Anthony show how much he care and look forward to Ian and Smosh
59:38 forgot to sensor that?
God y’all were my childhood it’s so crazy seeing both of y’all for the first time since the smash break up and y’all are so mature I’m very happy to see it.
Bruh I am CRYING, this comes full Circle. I’m definitely not gonna let smosh Die lmao. I will be playing all of the videos as background noise just so y’all get views 😂
Ian is so hot.
whoever reads this, i hope you accept that Jesus is our lord and savior and he loves us even through sin. I love even my dad who has done nothing for me
Not sure you guys truly realize the impact you had on my generation. I'm 28-years-old, I was a Smosh diehard through the bulk of my formative teen years. Same with my best friend. The channel shaped our sense of humor in a major way (our parents can attest to this). Next month I'm the best man at his wedding, and we still talk about Smosh years later. Even the "Sex Ed Rocks" song made learning about that topic much less daunting, as funny as that may sound. Genuinely appreciate you guys, watching the old videos brings me back to those days when everything in life was so simple. From the Pokémon music video to the Food Battles, still love em.  Nice to see you two back together. Rooting for ya both! Thanks for everything.
You guys should grow back your Bieber bangs for old times sake
Smosh became too repetitive and milked content too much so sometime after Anthony left I stopped watching. I'm really happy Ian and Anthony managed to reconnect and excited for what work they will produce together!
This is amazing! I'm so happy for you guys! But I hope your channel will stay the same and the "I spent a day with..." series will continue.
Crazy to hear that they fell apart through the company’s growth. It’s sadly understandable but hopefully this time around they can be more open about things with each other. They have both been through a lot, and a lot of the same things. I wish them luck.
This whole conversation was so well structured and told such a raw, inspiring story of the two of you. I never watched Smosh when I was younger but I’ve since followed the Smosh pit content and Anthony’s channel for a while and I’m inspired and excited to watch your new content. So happy for the both of you!!
Ready for some new mealtime with smosh episodes!!!
This is a huge moment for those of us that grew up in part on YouTube. Personally my favorite part of watching this unfold is watching Ian and Anthony finally reach a point of reconnecting as people. I’m sure you both could’ve carried on with your individual endeavors and both been successful, but I have to assume in your shoes I’d feel a deep sort of resolution in rekindling a relationship that was so important in the past. It’s like watching mom and dad or siblings reconnect after realizing we’re all human. Super happy for you both, excited for what is to come.
The episode that was the most expected and the modt fullfilling yet… Its so good to see the two creative individuals I admire come back together. I am soo full of joy to see this conversation to be had by two big influencers. This really goes to show how famous people are not just vain but also very complex and philosophycal at times.
The original YouTube child in me is SCREAMING WITH JOY right now! SMOSH, Game Grumps, and Shane Dawson are the 3 10+ year YouTubers that made me love this website. Seeing the fact that all 5 of you are thriving and still going brings me joy I can't measure
So question Anthony, if you’re coming back, does that mean maybe Lasercorn, Jovenshire, Sohinki, and Mari will also come back to Smosh Games?
53:09
Seeing a  broken friendship get fixed is super cool to see. It gives me hope that some of mine can be healed.
THE NEW RHETT AND LINK THEY LOOKING LIKE THEM SLOWLY!!!
i love this conversation. you guys were an inspiration for so many & now i’m following my dream playing games online, i truly don’t think i’d believe this was possible if not for you guys. so hype for the future of smosh. congratulations!!!! 🫶 hope to meet y’all one day!
I remember watching at 8 “molester moon” and thinking it was about hugging. When i told my mom about molester moon she was PISSED
WOOOAH bout time
1:11:29 I literally want to cry
wow, the internet has evolved
Kings
It’s two friends who learned over the span of more than a decade how to communicate their emotions instead of being passive aggressive. They’ve come such a long way and I’m so proud of their growth along the way to come back to the beginning!! 👏🏽👏🏽
I love how open you both are with everything, I'm so happy this exists ❤
I wasn't there for the beggining but god damn im happy i get to witness these legends for the first time
I have seen a lot of amazing you tube friendship die out due to a multitude of things. It makes me so happy to see Ian and Anthony together again because it confirms that their friendship is stronger than money, fame and other bare necessitates. Love you guys since the beginning.
Holy shit i met one of my old best friends in almost the EXACT same way we had this science thing with partners and there was this picture of this girl and my friend and i darkened out her teeth made a mustache and gave her a lazy eye😂
Happy to see smosh again ❤
FUUUUUCKKKK YEEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
While I never watched Smosh and only followed Anthony a few years ago I’m so happy for you guys ❤️
Ian, Anthony here's the thing-- I will buy into a smosh membership once I see that I'm getting smosh again. A couple videos and see if it still works and if it does... yeah I'll do it.
My first time watching smosh I was a young kid and it was about shitting on the carpet 😂
i wonder how the teacher that paired them is doing
Remember when you, Ian, and I Set My Friends On Fire did that Sex Ed music video? That was fire.
This discussion really put me at peace with what Smosh is today. Thank you for sharing the rawness of your friendship ❤️ I am so touched by both of your stories and growth — thank you
sketch comedy is by no means dead. just look at the popularity of "I Think You Should Leave". It's too bad that youtube isn't the platform for it anymore because young content creators will have a hard time doing what Smosh did back in the day. The organic creativity you had back in 2006/7 was amazing <3. It's so exciting to see you two back together. I really never thought I would see it again. Love you guys
22:51 Louis and Zayn in 25 years confronting each other about the band
I never watched Smosh back in my younger days, and I probably won't in the future either, but if it happens, it happens. But ultimately, it's just awesome to see something from the old days, even if it wasn't something I was actively following, coming back in a good way.  You know, I think the two of you should go fishing
"Somebody has to make those mistakes first to learn what works and what doesn't work"  I've been talking to my aunt a lot about this lately. She often brings up how people use to say to do things one way, and now they say to do the opposite.  I tell her that the way I see it, humanity has always been, and continues to be, one giant experiment. We're constantly discovering things. And the best way we know to discover and learn is to try things.  And probably because mass communication is a pretty recent thing in human history, a lot of times people try things over and over again before we figure something out.
Im glad we got the timeline where yourfavoritemartian and smosh come back. Pretty good timeline outcomes rn honestly.
Wassabi got back, now them. The nostalgia😭
it feels so nostalgic seeing then together again. Smosh was my childhood (well, a strange thing to see in your childhood but still)
Thank god they have Smash back. The current smosh just isn’t it… I miss food battles and etc
The mention of the milk fic at the end triggered my fight or flight. Jesus Christ.
If you love someone, let ‘em go. If they come back, they always loved you. This is real friendship love.
9:07 I remmeber being 10 years old when smosh was popular. And its true, all the kids loved it
I wanna hear rhett and links side! Maybe on ear biscuits ?
so when is smosh: the movie 2
In the words of Spongebob _THE _*_PIONEERS_*
44:01 mmhmm ya mmhmm
I love this but I hope it doesn’t take away or end your personal channel. It’s one of my favorites!
I feel like Anthony is a little more emotional than Ian is in all of it..... Lmao even without the emo hair XD I'm playing I love them both!
They FINALLY understand that they both ARE Smosh and if one of them isn’t part of it, Smosh is just a business or in other words just another YouTube Channel. We the fans fell in love with you two idiots😅and the funny ideas you guys had TOGETHER.  Shit happens for a reason and it had to go through this painful way so it can be strong af in the end.  I’m excited
56:35 I thought no one ROFLed in real life... You guys said it yourselves.
If YouTube is being a bitch can Rumble help?
I grew up watching Smosh so it’s actually really nice and nostalgic to see that they’re teaming up again! feel 14 again hahah
ian sounds like mrbeast when mrbeast is not screaming
Never thought I'd say this again, but... *Ahem* ... Food Battle 2023 when?
I used to love watching smosh as a kid and teen and I’m so happy to see Anthony and Ian reconnect it truly gives me hope. I really wanna see another mail time with Smosh those were my absolute favourite videos and made me cry from laughter 😂 I love you guys can’t wait to see the new videos. ❤
i remember when i was like 7 years old i used to always watch the sketches with my younger brother
So what you're saying is ISetMyFriendsonFire will be in a new skit?
Well yes, I love watching ian and anthony reminding each other of how they started smosh!
Hi long time ago didnt see you i stoped watching smosh when you left and smosh became disneyland
Hey Anthony! From a fellow Mafioso enthusiast, it will be very interesting if you bring in ex-high ranking italian mafia member for an interview. For instance, Michael Franzese or Sammy The Bull. Keep up with the great content, really enjoy binge watching this whole series❤️❤️
Ian doesn’t seem like a good friend. He doesn’t seem genuine at all. Seems like a total douche
Thumbs up if you loved Smosh back in the early days! 👍
My mum has always said true friendships last through anything and find their true place again.
Congratulations boy's, Congratulations 👏❤
OMG, Ian turned out looking like a 80's dad. I hope his humor is still there. 😀 Wish the both of you success.
You guys were a bif part of my introduction to the internet culture thank you
I honestly think the split of you two doing Smosh (although being not the best circumstances) worked out very well in the end, I mean would there have been this much of an Impact if you kept going as it was? Many older Youtubers faded into the background and I think you and Ian seperating and growing as your own people honestly maybe worked out for the best! excited to see what comes next and wish you both the best
Bring back the iconic Shut Up intro
I know they say they hated daily vlogging but lunchtime with smosh was one of my favorite things back in the day
You can tell Ian was hurt. When Anthony left it put a whole lot of weight of Ian’s shoulders. His feelings are 100% validated. I’m glad Anthony is back, but I’ll never forget what Ian done for the channel. Ian stuck by them. Ian was the one that fought for the channel. Ian was the one that had that weight on his shoulders. Of course he had some resentment towards Anthony. I’m happy they are able to go past it, and work on it better. Ian still has walls, but he’s working on it.
Do food battle
The magic of Smosh was really in the inside jokes IMO. The fact you were referencing an older video from time to time, really made the audience feel like we were part of the group.   I'm really glad you're both working together again. I wish you both the best. :)
selling the channel was a canon event.
This is not an interview but a conversation haha but i am loving it
A long time ago, a photo of me showed up on a smosh web page making fun of 'bad cosplays' that resulted in me getting pretty badly online bullied for a while. I remember feeling absolutely devastated that these people I used to love watching could trigger something so cruel. I held a lot of internal resentment and anger towards smosh as a whole for it for a long time avoiding everything I could. And this video actually has helped give a lil better insight into the mess you guys were dealing with at the time as well. I'm actually really glad to see the growth and feel a lot less anger about the whole mess. This was really good insight, and I thank you for it.
Please anthony never stop with this channel!!
Anthony ily but please just let these people talk n finish their thoughts bro 😭
i am...  speechless.
this is so healing
God this is so cool, I wish smosh was real
Alternate title: Ian Is Bored
FOOD BATTLE 2023 INCOMING
No hate, but i think that Ian needs to improve his vocabulary. For instance,look at how many times he says the word "like"without saying anything else really , from 37:00 to 39:00
They both still look youthful
Name a better bromance, bet you can’t
As one of those “kids”  that watched Smosh back then thank you guys, big part of my childhood
Seeing two best friends make a business, sell a business, and buy it back years later after reuniting their friendship is so inspiring to me.
We have to get an Anthony Funeral Roast.
Honestly, this video is so meaningful to me. I'm on my own creative journey and since I've watched you guys since high school (I'm in my 30s now) I just relate so hard to the high and lows of shifting into adulthood and how your grow, how life knocks you and when you just have very simple but authentic desires. This interview instills hope for me, as silly as that may be, for the creatie journey I've been through that has really knocked me to my core. Just, thank you guys for being yourselves and so candid.
Ustedes reviviran el viejo youtube
I wish I had this conversation before with my "Anthony" best friend. Some day I hope I will. RIP Isac, I will always remember you.
i really see this as so transformative for ian - from him operating off of fear, almost envying anthony’s courage in leaving smosh/defy, but then after the defy implosion - finding the courage to lead and then bringing up the possibility of rebuying - just awesome
This was the first instance of a long talking video where I was not immune to podcast. Fills me with pure happiness and excitement to see you two in sync again! This is gonna be so good.
YOU NEEEED TO SPEND A DAY WiTH sAM AND COLBY
Honestly bro I’ve never seen Ian and Anthony this vulnerable and open with each other, but I love it
fr back then i was like 12 and i cant even understand a word u guys said ,but that was the best thing i can do after school seeing two 18 dudes doing dump shx, love u guys so much .
I started watching smosh back in the beginnings of around 2007 (I was 10 y/o). I was full on learning English from your sketches and you guys influenced me on getting into the entetainment industry. Now, 16-17 yrs later, I'm working full time in the art department in the UK and I'm still watching Smosh. It's incredible to see what you guys have been through andit's really heartwarming seeing you guys reunite and buy back your brand. I have a lot of respect for you two. Keep on going on!
Does anyone else die to see the next food wars???????????????
Lowkey i still want food battles is that crazy
You guys are the best
can't wait to see what happens next in the new chapter of smosh
I started watching smosh when I was in elementary school, and now I’m in my 20s. Time flies.
"I still won't"😂😂
Great, the team is back.👍👍👍👍👍  But  " What Movies were real" were good too. To see from  a other view as before. Maby a good idea.

The best thing about ALL of this, is just seeing you two reconnect again & get back the thing you created together. I’m truly so happy for you both & I hope it makes you both so happy too. Obviously we are all looking forward to the content from you both again! But I’m just genuinely so happy that you have your channel back & each other back as friends
Is there going to be food war 2023
41:40 Ok I’m crying. This is awesome! I’m so happy for you guys 😭🥲❤
Okay. SMOSH Summer/Winter Games! With the SMOSH cast plus the OGSoG (Mari, Joven, LCorn, Sohinki) then a couple of Mythical people. Referees are Rhett and Link, plus Sarah and Joe! OGSoG can do their podcast on the camp, Anthony can do his I spent a day with OGSoG. Then, on SMOSH Games they can play Board Games with mix of SMOSH cast and OGSoG, while on the camp, (Secret Hitler, Trial by Trolley), then another video of them playing Mario Party!, They can also do the SMOSHCast and have Anthony as their guest and the people from OGSoG. The possibilities are endless!
I been watching smosh since I was 11 years
FOOD BATTLE 2023 NEEDS TO HAPPEN ASAP
Man I used to watch you guys so much back in the day. Very happy to see you guys again.
Hey Anthony, if you have time, I'd love you to answer this: What's happening to PressALike?
LFG
Now we wait for the emo hair
"Somebody's gonna write a fanfic about this" Ian, we know it's you. Shut up. 😆
Lol anthony is such a smitten kitten
With all the love and good memories you guys make me have, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I was there in 2006/7 until 2015. You guys really lived the dream and it is so incredible that you saw the opportunity back then. Having this kind of creative energy is a blessing to the boring everyday life we are living. Having a handful of creative people like you gave so much positive energy to millions of people. thank you for this nice one hour long video. you guys were my idols when i was a little boy. Now looking back to it i drown in the tears of my own nostalgia. Incredible.
Im very impressed how you guys handled these conversations. You guys have shown so much personal growth over the years. Im so happy for you guys.  Love you guys
“YouTube Daddies couples therapy session”
Ian’s rationality and dedication have been instrumental in keeping Smosh alive for the past 6 years. Anthony has also been a big part of the channel and a fan favorite. He left the channel in 2017 due to his emotions and mental health. I applaud him for taking care of himself and I’m happy that they are reunited now. I hope that this marks the beginning of a new golden age for Smosh. Best of luck to Ian & Anthony!
Yall set the standard for what youtubers are today. Legends
Love the health, the communication and the bromance
This brings back memories of 2015
❤
Tbh I've been watching Smosh since I was a kid, and after Anthony left and Smosh is going to different direction, so I lost interest and stop watching Smosh, can't believe all these years passed with Covid happened and I've already got married now, and finally now I still got the chance to see that Smosh is coming back! I'm so shock! And Big Thanks to Rhett and Link! I'm watching their videos too love their work!
“Behind every great man is a greater woman”, well behind every great smosh reconnection is a greater female influence lol
His name is Max and he's going to school
GIVE US THE HAIR BACK BOYS
welcome back guys hope you guys still have a fun time
But…. But…..BUT!!!  Will the Shut up intro be there?
WHERE’S IA- oh… there he is…
This would make a great movie tbh.
im sorry and im shure im not the only one but im a smosh watcher and havent watched ur videos once @anthonyPadilla but im realy glad u guys got back together and fixed ur problems and im glad u could come back feels like the family is whole again :)  iv watched from the start and i realy feel what u were going trough i have that with my own friend aswell but it will all work out in the end even if u burn smosh in to the ground (its not gonna hapen) the important thing is u have ur friendship :) and btw u were bestfriend and they do have a nac of coming back even after years of not talking or hanging out they still come and hug u when u need that <3 thats what best friend are for
This news makes my heart sing. It’s another time now and everyone is much older but when Anthony left Smosh it was very shocking and sad and I saw the sadness in Ian with the split and the sadness in Anthony whenever I checked in with his projects. Both are talented in their own individual right but it was the fun and creativity of two besties creating content together and running at the top levels of the whole YouTube game that was awe inspiring. Burn out and exhaustion is a real thing. Been there. Done that. The world is easier to process and life is easier to do when the schedule of life is so that you can have more control and a happy work life balance. Kudos boys! WELCOME BACK.
I am so happy to see this!
Fully enjoyed the video But!.... I feel like anthony has worked himself out as a person and Ian is still holding on to some sort of resentment "Mhum, Mhum, Mhuuuum" Once you hear it you can't unhear it. This doesn't feel like a naturual  make up, It feels like the False friendship business relationship they discuss reignited.
I dont know how many times i watched the pokemon video back before 2010. You guys were my first experience with YouTube when i was 16. Im 33 now and i cant be more happy about this video. The true youtube og's. Better then lonelygirl15 and brookers lol
Super cool video wish you shared this on smosh channel. I was looking for explanation, thanks
okay youve convinced me ill pay for a membership
Anthony is so spiritual and attuned to his feelings. No wonder he's such a good interviewer
The Pokémon video was the first YouTube video me and my friends watched on repeat! We used to force our IT teacher to play it on the projector in our classes when we were 16 ⚡️ such nostalgia.
I love how genuinely giddy and excited our OG funny boys are here. It's amazing to see them so happy and healed. Things can only go up from here!!
Christians funded an entire high budget Jesus TV series from crowdfunding soooo y'all can probably do it. Although you're not exactly *Jesus* 🤷‍♂ Although some of your fans probably do feel like this is Jesus's second coming
Ian's "Whaat!" impression of Rhett and Link was like 100% Rhett, it was so good.
This is so exciting!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Anthony is such a cringe ball and two-faced person, I wouldn't work with him either. But hey, buying back a dying channel seems...like an awful idea. Good luck.
Im so happy for them coming together again being an og smosh fan they’ve grown so much im glad they’re still friends ❤
1:10:55 ok. ok. when i was like 14 my friend was looking through his old wattpad and he found an old smosh fanfic that he wrote a couple years prior. he started describing it then i was like "wait, isnt that the fic where ian and anthony are exes and reconcile with each other then slow dance in the living room" and we found out that i had read his fic before we even met. the plot to the fic is basically what's happened between smosh irl sans romance, except he wrote it in like 2013 so there was no fucking way he'd have known what was to come. when they danced at the end of thus video then ian made a joke about a fanfic i was actually stunned.
Food wars when?
THIS is the most healthy convo ive ever seen
Food battle 2023???
Yoooooo nice
Man this makes me cry. Nostalgia
Really a different side of Ian has emerged with the reacquisition.
I’m sooo excited. I clicked on this video soooo fast Really happy for you
The honesty and growth of these two by still remaining funny and sweet is truly wonderful -well done to both of you ❤
i love the way ian talks, he sounds like such a dreamer if you get what i mean
I remember watching Smosh back in my high school years. I'm happy smosh is back i feel old lol
wow I used to watch them in high school and now I just finished grad school. I used to love the smosh games and IanH channels. I am so happy that they rekindled and bought it back. I’m so excited for this new era!!!
I loved the smosh movie
just watching youtube bros talk about feelings. So healing for life and the internet
Jesus almost 20 years? I’m 20 now…
This interview is so bittersweet but it also brings me so much joy. I felt like I kind of grew up on Smosh as I watched it in my teenage years. So in a way it is really nostalgic and I'll always love the old content. But now being in my mid-twenties and seeing you both come together again makes me so excited to see how your comedy has evolved and to see how it will appeal to old and new fans. I can't wait to see what you both have planned!  But also, I want to touch on how good of an interview this is. I think it's so amazing that you two could sit down as adults and talk about the problems you had, and that you admit where you each had faults. And that you recognize how important that time apart and growth was, despite how difficult it may have been in the moment. Not to mention the fact it shows how realistic your friendship is and that it's not perfect. But it's real and it's genuine, and it's such a great example of how time and circumstances change people. I can't even imagine how difficult it is to have that kind of relationship scrutinized by the public and feel the weight of those expectations. But it really says a lot that you both were able to realize what you needed separately and that it allowed you both to grow so you could get to this point. It's so incredibly humanizing, and as someone who's currently on their own long and extensive journey to better myself and as someone who loved you two as a duo way back when it means a lot to me. It gives me hope that good things come and go, but change doesn't always have to be a bad thing because it can lead to something far more beautiful in the long run. 💙
I could be completely wrong but I think Anythony is a little more excited about Bringing Smosh back than Ian. You can see his Excitement and Hope for their Friendship And reconnection/Smosh throughout the video though Ian is well how to say, more subjective?, Concerned about the business aspect of it? I hope they become very Good and tight friends again and that both of their fun and creative spirits will be rekindled with the rebirth of Smosh! I hope the barriers between them fully break and that while their maturity is cool, that their genuine silly nature comes out and shows through their new Smosh videos.
this feels like a child watching their parents' marital therapy video
I was 6 when I saw there first video. Amazing
look at anthony, being an evolved and beautifully emotional human <3333
Hi! I was about eleven when we found your video I'm not a kid anymore dont worry lol
I feel you Ian, I don’t feel anything sometime and it scares me that I become that way.
This episode is just too beautiful, both Anthony and Ian opening up finally really made me feel like, yknow they are also humans at the end of the day, and this had made me so much more of a fan of smosh and a whole and especially both of their journeys in life to finally get to this point! I was a younger viewer of smosh at the time and it is truly bewildering to finally see all the behind the scenes that they had. The feelings that were finally spoken felt incredibly relieving and you can see it through this awesome video. Truly, each person had their own path, and reuniting just made it even better. Thank you Anthony and Ian ❤
maybe get also a floatplain for smosh
i would love a smosh try guys collab
"Going Into The Mountains" was one of the last videos aside from lunchtime with smosh. I grew up watching you while sippin' a juice box, and now its a beer. Words can not describe how I am feeling. Thanks you two for teaching us how to laugh and reminding us what its like to grow up as young kids/adults. Grateful for your two's existence..
I remember loving Smosh so much that I even watched them open mail. My teen hood was just ..a mess and seeing two friends just open mail and do food war was just, nice
Bitter-sweet. It's sad, but an enjoyable episode. I'm glad you're both trying.
WOW!  The band is back together!  I love OG Smosh!
I like how this episode felt like an interview with anthony himself for the first time. I'm also very thankful they were comfortable opening up and finally giving us insight on what their relationship was through this whole journey.
Best video ive seen in my life. Im glad they are passionate about this because i think that is what was missing.
So full circle for me I was OBSESSED with you guys as a kid it was my first introduction to YouTube as a place to find entertainers, y’all paved the way ❤️
I remember watching smosh religiously this is such a raw moment.  i just re subscribed to The Smosh channel  im happy to support you guys on there again.
From food battles to backwards-words, dixon cider, and ERBH tmnt omg a wave of nostalgia just hit me 🥹 you guys are my childhood
.épico
The first video of you two after buying smosh is funny as fuck you guys got some true talent
Been here since the Toby Turner era (Tobuscus),  Smosh, and Toby are OG 🫶🏼
Does this mean maybe we will get summer games back??
Bring back lunchtime with Smosh!
I enjoyed the movie, it wasn't bad guys. Thanks for making me and my brother laugh as kids.
Can’t wait for their return!
Love u guys❤
Bring back food battle
Faith in humanity is restored 🥲
wtf is the milk fanfic? XDDDDDD
Man I remember that I watched when I was kid and it made my childhood
"We have literally gone through a generation of people":.. when I told my sister that Anthony and Ian owned Smosh again... she had no idea who I was talking about. She's 18.
Yo but what about Charlie
There's a worse verison of the Smosh movie?
Ian looks like he's going to "realize your potential" in the Las Vegas strip.
I'm excited for what's ahead. Honestly, hearing your guys story is kinda inspirational to me. I have this beat friend as well. We started hanging out during the second quarter of my freshman year of high school which was about the 2006-2007 school year. In a way our friendship grew in parallel with Smosh and we stumbled upon the channel together some how. He even lived with me, my mom, and my brother for 5 years when he didn't have a place to go. I literally call him my brother and I know his family as well. I remember when I would get my paycheck every other week and I'll be like "wanna go get lunch?" Then we end up at Applebee's and get the 2 entries and 1 appetizer for $20. Well it seemed like in the past few years we kinda drifted apart. We rarely talk to each other anymore. And I get it, he's married now and got his own life going on and sometimes we are able to click back into that groove again. But if you guys can make it back full circle, then I'm sure we will too. I do know deep down we will always be close friends cause of our history and stuff. It's just the tunnel can seem pretty long you know? Good luck in this next chapter guys.
You mean " I spent a day with my BEST FRIEND "
i saw it all from the start, can't wait for Smosh's evolution
WOOOW
Such a reunion.
Never watched or cared to watch Smosh in all my time on YouTube, but I love to see the reconciliation and renewal. Best of luck to you both.
"I know this is the right thing. And if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you." ❤
just skipping here and there to see if any of them cry xD
It’s so cool to see those pictures of you guys as kids. I’m from Sacramento and I remember being in middle school and everyone knowing where the “Smosh House” was 😂 All the neighborhood kids still root for y’all!
I discovered you guys when I was 7 on my ps3. You guys gave me so many pleasant memories. I remember watching Anthony's draw my life and when he talked about his anxiety I related to that cause I was a shy kid. I always wanted to make content because of y'all. Seeing you sitting together again makes me so happy. I hope the future of smosh will run better with you two steering the boat.
Yeah, it deffo felt like Anthony hated Smosh for like a hot minute. Especially when Smosh kept making the "where's Anthony" jokes. And the tension between the two of them was felt for a good minute.
oh this is really sic <3 congrats and ALL HAIL SMOSH - mb start a podcast in kick?
I know things will never be the same but god it feels good to be back
"even if we burn this to the ground, I'm happy to do it with you" 🥺🥺🥺
Anthony I used to watch og Smosh when I was like 10 - 15 and it's amazing that you and Ian are bringing it back but I am worried that you guys will be too busy making up skits for you to continue your interviews with people I love Smosh but your independent channel is something no one of your size does. Will we continue to see regular uploads from you on this channel?
growing up watching the first few videos and seeing this has been so beautiful. it reminds me of my best friends growing up and coming back together and how we can also reconnect like this no matter the changes ;,) <3 glad to see yall back
Espero vuelvan a ser mejores amigos , yo perdí al mío por sentimientos similares y lo extraño
I found smosh when i was 7 or 8 and I am now 18. I remember my parents hating you guys for the language you used but I would try to convince them of how funny you were. I would also constantly make my dad mad by saying "what the firetruck" all the time.
This is so wholesome and awesome. And yes, you definitely did have an impact - I was sort of abandoned as a teen and had lots of mental health issues and your videos really brightened up that dark time :) Turning 25 now :)
Im really happy to know that the most incredible friendship of youtube is together again please if you 2 are going to bring something from the old smosh it needs to be at leats one food battle with the same energy as the older one's
Correction: both hot. both funny.  Seeing the growth and maturity that blossomed over this time frame made you both age like fine wine and we're thirsty 😏🍷 😂
41:48 😭😭
Ya'll gotta bring back Lunchtime w/Smosh!!🔥💯
I want to say a bunch of lovely heart felt things about this, but i'd rather just say you guys are gonna kill it. SMOSH IS BACK BABY!!!!!!
Hope they guest Jovershire again or the whole original Smoshgames crew
I feel like what made Anthony left Smosh is because it's not theirs. They can't use their own ideas.
I'm still shocked that smosh started years ago and has changed a lot since then. And I used to watch them together and now I watch them separately sometimes.
Bring back fan mail opening videos 🙏
Please do lunchtime with smosh a thing again
I remember waiting for a new video and everytime y'all uploaded a new one me and my brothers would watch them and laugh together,you know I grew up watching y'all and it brought me a lot of joy and now I'm crying because of all the nostalgia and the wonderful times I spent during those years watching you to together ❤
I loved smosh and nigahiga!! 💕
“my childhood friend is still here” and “If we burn it to the ground, I’m happy it’s with you”  Right into the heart 😭😭
Man I have waited for this day 🥰 I am so glad that you guys are back along with the old smosh! My brother introduced me to you guys when I was about 10 years old and use to have pictures of Anthony as my lock screen on a tablet I had(because I thought Anthony was hot!)😅here I am almost 21 years old and still rewatch the old smosh when I had a rough time 😊definitely going to watch smosh again ❤ proud of you guys for getting smosh back
"Lets burn it to the ground" - Ian Hecox  Im terribly excited for whats to come i cant wait to see this beatifull reunion
ian looks like anthony's disapproving father
I started watching you guys when i was 11. Im now 28, married to my high school sweetheart with 2 kids. And my husband and i reminisce on your classic videos. So excited to watch the new videos ❤
Wow hearing them talk about each other and the journey they been through over the years with their legacy and Smosh really is something I didn't think we would get, but very grateful for.
Still kinda surprised and excited to see them own Smosh. Can't wait to see what's in store. 👀😎👍
Smosh the movie is like they made a hours long smosh videos so I'm sure there's a lot of people can enjoy it just like me
I'm the angry one in a million but andy.... your partner tried his best to stay on topic towered the generally company goal and overall message at the time . how dare you act above him.
Yay! Mordecai and Rigby are back!
If these guys ever do a movie again it should just be a documentary on smosh and how their friendship evolved.
I love you guys im so excited. 🎉🎉🎉
Im so glad they're back together as best friends we can now go back to the good old days and so happy for them
SMOSH IS BACK IN THE RIGHT HANDS
God if this isn't the best yt related news outta 2023, i don't what else there is! Super stoaked to see the og smosh back in🎉
Please bring Back Peter Peter ! I miss everyone from smosh  you can’t have southpark without Stan Kenny cartman Kyle either  but the other characters as well! It’s just not the same! I stopped watching the new smosh because it wasn’t smosh anymore after having new characters it’s just not smosh the content wasn’t smosh either I’m soooo excited i still watch smosh the og over and over! Now I get to watch more omg! I also want southpark to go back to their roots there are so many episodes they can make so many to be continued episodes that I would love to watch so many ideas  man oh man boy oh boy I am excited
can we talk about the first 13 seconds of this video and how its not staged * if you are slow* sarcasm
I literally sent this video to homie who I considered a best friend in middle school. I’m 25 now. I haven’t spoken to that guy in ages but I sent him this and now we’re catching up. Full circle.
Refused's Tannhauser is such an evocative song, I can see why it would have such significance for you both.  Anyone reading this right now who hasn't heard Tannhauser should really give it a go.
Brandon rogers had some of the craziness that smosh use to bring. I’m happy you guys are back.
You guys should have offered Rhett and Link stocks for Smosh 😂😂
I just need to get out that ive been watching smosh since the pokemon theme cover. This feels surreal.
Personally think the smosh movie was dope
THANK YOU SO MUCH SMOSH IM ABOUT TO CRY
This tale of friendship is oddly relatable
it feels like my childhood is back again
This is the best thing I’ve watched on YouTube in several years… super excited to see what these two can do together again
Smosh back together again is giganice
Ian seems a lot more authentic and honest
Ian being the Wiseman and Anthony being the Energy makes so much sense now. I never knew who they actually were and now thinking back on videos I can see it so clearly. Go Smosh!
I remember coming home from school and watching Smosh on the family computer back in like 2008. The ones I always loved was That Damn Neighbor! Good times.
“If it fails, I’m glad to have it fail with you” damn Ian 😢 that’s beautiful
Aside from the fact that I'm absolutely thrilled to have something return that arguably shaped a huge part of my humor...can I just say that both Anthony and Ian are incredibly attractive dudes? And they each are attractive in a different aesthetic? It's kinda awesome seeing what the two of them grew up to be
LET'S BURN IT TO THE GROUND🔥🔥
Seeing a snippet of them acting as if no time had passed and theyre just being their old goofy selves at the end literally made me cry a bit. :) its crazy to see these two together again.   Even if it burns to the ground, at least theyre doing it together!
Did anyone else notice that Ian lost weight? He looks good. Not that he didn’t before but still
It makes me so sad that the best videos/fav content from them they were suffering :( They are my favorite!!!!! Love u guys. This video cured my inner child!!!!!❤
I never realized Anthony's type A kind of bossy behavior and Ian still having to take deep breaths, let Anthony talk a lot, etc. I hope Anthony can rein that in a bit.
I feel like you two still don’t like each other and harbor a lot of resentment. Just going to cling to each other like life rafts I guess.
I think Ian is far happier to have Anthony back than Anthony actually is to be back. I just feel like Ian cares a lot about Anthony and probably always have, he was probably heart broken during their time apart. I hope that everything goes well for the both of them in the future.
I actually grew up watching Smosh, but there was a period of time I stopped (probably during the Defy period and I got really busy with life) but I am really happy that both of you guys acquired it again!!!! Woo!!  Keep the freshness going and stay strong!!
such a real interview watching you two when iwas growing up the reason I'm still on youtube so many years later. happy for the new chapter
what a time to be alive aaaa
These guys made my childhood. Im glad they got to legally own what they created.
Holy shit, my high school era nostalgia is coming back. THEYRE BACK!
I actually loved the smosh movie thought it was the exact way to make a movie based around a strange idea like YouTube ya know
FOOD BATTLE 2023
My heart is happy. Two old friends coming back together to do what they love.
Hearing that they weren’t actually best friends is kinda heartbreaking. This is what WWE kids must feel when they learn its not real.
Bro I wanna see new game rap videos 😭
not the milk fic in the year of our lord 2023…
Anthony padilla your the one I choose you!

ok but now I wanna know what the milk fanfic was???
While Smosh being back is amazing, I'm the most happy seeing them being friends again
Not to put too much pressure on you guys, but this whole thing has literally restored my hope in life and faith in humanity  But really, this is so incredibly wholesome and amazing. I can't imagine what the journey has been like for you guys... from best friends to business partners to drifting apart, all to come back full circle again in what seems like an incredible situation all around (as if it were back to the beginning, only with more experience/maturity and actual financial stability lol). Yet beyond Smosh and any success it has, this is an incredible HUMAN moment. This is a story of maturing as a person, battling through the downs in life, and realizing a special bond you can have with someone you love even after years of struggles (even if you guys do a good job of staying serious, it's clear the bond you two have is special and obviously means a ton to you both). That makes me genuinely emotional and makes me think of all the friends I've had in my life and how I love them all even if we haven't talked in years. We're all just people at the end of the day, and the connections we have with each other is more valuable than anything else. I hope you two have a fucking blast together and that Smosh is wildly successful, but above all, can be best friends again and just enjoy every bit of what you've done and will do. Do it for yourselves and each other, your fans will love every damn second of it
This was the most unexpected thing this entire decade
I’m🎉😂😢utterances and then we’ll I’m going on the beach and I will be home in the next few minutes and I can go tell you to my head to my house to go get back home and I take care about you getting home in the morning and then I will be there for you and I can go tell her that you have a ride home with her mom is going on a trip and then we’ll I’m just waiting on fort and I can get😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
“If we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you.” 🥹
I do wish we could hear about Anthony's opinions and stuff on pit and games
Ima go resub
Dreams do come true
I support this so much. Have so many memories from the OG days.
Smosh is so much more than just a channel, it’s a history of YouTube and internet
Ian had me tearing up at the end there (before the onlyfans thing)
It feels like we're voyeurs in a really healing conversation
Hearing the excitement practically bursting at the seams in Anthony’s voice as he talks about the future of Smosh gets me so excited as well, there’s gonna be such an amazing revival with the channels. I’m looking forward to all the new content ❤❤❤
I mean this was so refreshing. I always felt like Anthony hated it at the end and that Ian was always stoic. I feel like I’m seeing the real smosh right now and it’s crazy. The kid in me is happy for sure.
the colab you guys did with ISMFOF on both the sex ed rocks and four years foreplay seriously was the best thing ive ever witnessed! me and my buddies in highschool back then watched your guys' videos all damn day. im so glad you guys are back together i cant wait to see the content
and here we are almost 20 years later and anthony´s hair still looks like it´s trying too hard
Interview Niko Omilana
this was really an amazing vid and i feel honored to have watched and get closure over what had happened before and now moving forward with you guys owning smosh again (,:
I bet Ian won’t watch this one either….
All the support.
OH MY GODNESS MY CHILDHOOD!!! I LOVE W??YOU????????????❤ REVOLUTION SQUAD... STAY BLESSED STAY SAFE...OUT
Why did Ian blacklist Lyle? The fucking goober.
A lot of things is falling into pieces as of late. A lot of things, and comes this, which brings a lot of joy again.
I cried when i saw the thumbnail - im not even subscribed to anthony
I dont know why i feel like i haven't heard Ian really really talk before. And  he seems so comfortable and really enjoying talking to Anthony. And Ian actually sounds decent. I am so happy i get to see them back together 🎉🎉🎉
Smosh the movie 2?!
Wtf matt good works for anthony padilla?!
I’m in love with Ian
I rly hope this means we get a new food war
my favorite video was the molester moon
11:46 I used to love them vlogs fr
watching this video made me really surprised at how emotionally intelligent both Ian and Anthony is. Of course I know that their characters on smosh weren't actually who they are in real life, but hearing them talk about their relationship in such a thoughtful and analytical way was just really nice to see. Hearing them talk about not relying on nostalia for the future of smosh and instead having small references makes me feel really confident in the future of smosh.  Congrats you guys on buying smosh! The future looks bright!
We all have to admit, with all due respect to Ian, that when Anthony left the jokes became so ohhh so bad and cringe. It was painful to see. When he said he feels like it was getting bastardised i totally get it. Hope they get back together.  They are so good when they do their own shit. 💛🤞🏼✌🏼
My childhood man😢😢 this is amazing
Food battle 2023
🙄 Too Little Too Late. Social Media Has Changed So Drastically. You Wasted Your Money. Spending Vasts Amounts Of Money. Won’t Bring Back Your Good Ole Days. OverSaturated Competition Exists More Than Ever Today. 🙄
I never watched smosh but my boyfriend grew up religiously watching it as a child (lol) and as we’re watching this I asked if this felt super nostalgic and this man passionately goes “YES! The last time I have seen them together is when they sat down together in a video to tell their child ,me, that mommy and daddy are breaking up.” 😭
Pioneers
i remember getting in trouble as a kid for watching y’all, i think specifically it was the water video
Do a kickflip
Smosh isnt smosh without ian and Anthony's ideas and creativity.  Super glad you guys are back at it
YOu missed the opportunity to name it "Smosh spent a day together with Smosh".
Smosh is YouTube, Smosh is the internet (the good parts that is), Smosh was a huge part of my childhood.
SMOSH as a comedy empire makes me think of what TMG is doing with podcasting
Such a beautiful episode
I'M SO FUCKING HAPPY 😭😭😭
I am so proud of them for being so vulnerable, I'm excited to see what comes of it. And shout out to Rhett and Link, they seem like such good, caring guys.
❤❤❤
Word, I feel you Ian. Buddy went Hollywood. All you did was get a Porsche Ian. It’s all good. It’s life. Least he’s back hopefully for the better.
Finally these 2 weirdos are back together again 🎉
this is exactly what was meant to happen. i am so happy. been watching u since 2010. ❤️
Was born in 99 and fondly remember coming up on their golden era of youtube. really parasocially hype and cathartic to see ya'll reconnecting and definitely hope to see the freely creative, silly goofy sketches ya'll can create in this new era of smosh!! I think a semi-long format sketch show like snl supporting strong guest comedians that's faster than snl but more rewarding than short form content could be really sick
Smosh were a big part of my childhood, I remember them being one of the first people I saw on youtube and found absolutely hilarious
what
SHOUT OUT TO THE PERSON BEHIND THE CAMERA FOR CLAPPING AT THE END , U DID WHAT WE ALL WANTED TO DO
I grew up with you guys wow
FINALLY THE VIDEO WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FORRRR
Now we know who's the father and who's the mother between their friendship haha Anthony is the mother who have the heart and emotions and Ian is the dad who press his feeling inside hahah
25:23
I'm so overjoyed to see smosh again! This conversation was so wholesome and the insight was so spot on. The way they both matured and and expressed themselves was so beautiful. ❤
my name is ian and my bestfriends name is anthony and all i can say is we are more than happy that you guys are back together on smosh
Does anyone remember smashtoons?????? Ninjas vs zombies was bloody brilliant 👏 👌
Its so insane and awesesome at the same time to see you two guys back together again. I started watching the channel from the very beginning (only creating my acount 2 years later) and stopped in like 2016 (before Anthony left) because it didn't felt genuine anymore. So this video is feels like a piece of my past, and im very hopeful for the things to come :)
we want the old smosh intro back pleaase x)
That last sentiment, "if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you." I'm so glad Ian said that. There will be sceptics and critics and haters but as long as they have fun, get to be creative and stay friends, it will have been a good thing. That's more important than views and engagement and even more important than crowdfunding.
I’m so happy for y’all, this really made my day seeing all these videos of y’all back together. I feel like a kid again 🥲
Sounds like two people with a victim mindset trying to prove that they’re the victim. For a few minutes the whole thing was them picking at each other like “oh you’ve grown but like, remember when you did that thing ? Yeaaaah”. They had to sit down and fix this before filming lol.
He finally found Anthony 🥲
Tears of the Smosh Channel
is food wars back?
Will you please interview Josh Chomik(thecomputernerd01)?
It's lovely to see how their old haircuts evolved into their current dressing style. The old emo haircut guy became a goth man. The old bowl haircut guy became the 70s man.
istg if i get to hear a “FOOIRSTT BOITEE” in 2023 i will cry this is the best news in the world tbh
pls do lunchtime w smosh ag
This feel is like one of the most important videos on the internet period.
I really respect this, man. As a creative it means a lot to see honest conversation about the way money can change a creative relationship. I hope the real chats remain <3
This man needs to sit down with devs of viral games like Scott Cawthon (FNaF), Toby Fox (Undertale), etc. It'd be pretty interesting.
Neither of them is wrong in their thinking though that’s the sad part, they couldn’t accept each other’s opinions and support each other trough their separate work. If this happens to Rhett and Link I will be heartbroken,it sounds stupid but I really would.
This felt like a therapy session at times. Ian the therapist and Anthony opening up. I swear I laughed a lot at times just seeing Ian go "Sure. Mhm. Yeah. Of course." while Anthony is crying and saying thank you for being a great friend so many times.  But seriously, thank you. I grew up closing off to the world, not sharing my emotions. I'd let it build up. Over the years I've learned to change old bad habits. Some are still hard to kick. Cannabis changed my life for the better though. So much has been thanks to cannabis, mostly.
is anthony sasuke and ian naruto?
Omg Smosh was literally my childhood, I'm so happy to see them together again 😢😢😢
I remember being 14 when I began watching Smosh, I’m 30 now! I miss the old YouTube.
Smosh was legit the channel i would look forward to every time i came home from school. Especially the fanmail opening. Never thought I'd see OG Smosh come back
Please do lunchtime with smosh again
you can tell anthony functions more through his emotions and ian is more logic minded
I’m so happy for you guys🎉. Food battle 2023🚀
if you see this, please bring back the "shut up" or another variant
Two bros, chillin in a podcast, 5 feet apart 'cause they *are* gay
This was such a heartwarming and mature conversation between two people who started out with making immature content
I'm so happy they are together again and having the chance to open up about their feelings .
Some might say it's a canon event? 1:07:21
Smosh it’s my emo teenage years, so grateful to watch them together again, the feelings 🥹🖤
It seems Apples to Oranges, but comparing the professional/personal relationships displayed between Smosh and GMM are somewhat of a lesson in male friendship as well as partnered business management. Ian and Anthony were teens when they started receiving fame for their crude mid-2000s humor, this type of content spoke to the teens with their new iPods as well as widespread computers and WIFI filling up homes, Smosh quickly evolved into Obnoxious, loud Gen-Z shock humor. I remember being 7 and watching 2010 Smosh vids on our home computer as they came out, me and my brother loved all their shit, and it honestly, along with 100 other things in the coming years, influenced our senses of humor.   Rhett and Link started their channel with admittedly much better quality editing due to them already being mostly adults, They had been friends since Elementary and they grew up living near each other and spending their childhood as close companions, when they started YouTube in 2006 they made music videos with witty, knee-slapper lyrics, as well as slightly absurd millennial humor based skits, this type of content spoke to a similar demographic as Smosh as well as viewers 5-10 years older, However, i make this comparison because come 2012,  Smosh's content was on par with Rhett and Link's in terms of comedic value to their respective demographics.   When it came to displaying their friendships within commercializing their content and bringing on sponsorships and companies, Rhett and Link (being college educated) took control and started GMM, a separate channel with a mother company, fully preserving their original content, in this new space, it being a morning show, it was dedicated to talking and sharing interest, their years long and fully established friendship had no reason not to persist.   Anthony and Ian were in an environment built by their 15 year old personalities, forcing them to retain that sense with each other, regardless of how much time they spent together, it was never right to respect each other as genuine adult friends, since there was never any genuine emotional bonding shared within the roots of the friendship. It would be hard to expect literal kids to understand the importance of genuine conversation and emotional connection, especially two teenage boys laughing til their lungs hurt at a fart joke they're super proud of, and then eventually making money off similar jokes, for years on end  Personally I feel like there was potential for a genuine life-long friendship that was spoiled by 21st century media and the strive to nurture a business built on ideas you may no longer agree with or even find entertaining. (idk the full GMM situation nowadays, all this info is off the top of my head)
If it's love you let them go, if they come back that's how you know ❤️
Dann this was one of the most honest conversations I’ve seen on the internet… this almost felt like I shouldn’t be able to hear this. It was really interesting and cool. Congrats boys, I’ve grown up w you guys and I’m proud of you for coming back after all this time better than ever
Smosh had the MilkFic, Dan and Phil had the SkinFic…what was wrong with us as fans 😂😂😂
So is the hair coming back though?
Fuck yeah I love this. Hell nah fuck that cringy 2014 -2023 shit. Idk how people love the new content. Bunch of unfunny mfs
how many damn times in an hour can some one say like Count:1643
I just finished watching SMOSH: The Movie  and I found it very funny! I love the current SMOSH channel, and to discover that the two original creators are back again, but all grown up is incredible! Good luck to you both! ✨
⭐
9.9/10 would be 10/10 if they were crying at then end ngl
This is frickin epic
The first YouTube channel I tuned into regularly and to see these two together again makes me feel like a child again
Smosh is the discussion we all have with our friends saying we are gonna live together and make videos when we were kids
DON'T CRY OR IM GONNA CRY MAN
It's been a while since I've tuned into Smosh, and it's bittersweet to acknowledge that every good story has its chapters. Even though I'm not a regular viewer these days, the rekindled friendship between Anthony and Ian strikes a warm chord. It's reassuring to know that their camaraderie has surpassed the barriers of time and will likely endure until the very end. How do you all feel about this reunion? Let's celebrate the good old times and the new beginnings!
I never really watched smosh but this video makes me so happy. Y’all are a YouTube cautionary tale so see it all have this happy ending is amazing
How many fools can I kill today?
Yes the fanfictions will start again
there’s nothing i can say in these comments that hasn’t already been said
I'm glad this video did well
the. milk. fanfic. LMAO
if i could get a time machine the first place im going is the smosh defy shutdown rager
i think smosh was my first channel i ever subscribed to as a kid.  the good ol days. i’m glad you both are still friends 🥺 i always go back and rewatch old smosh vids to give me some serotonin
As a man who fell out with my childhood best friend (we had known each other since year 7!) I am so pleased to see Anthony and Ian reunited as best friends and is Smosh restored. God bless you both.
I'm just gonna say it... This video gave my heart a boner. Seeing you two in the same room again is just so exciting. I remember all the way back to the first food battle video when I was in elementary school. Me and my friends would watch you guys together and we loved it. Honestly this makes me want to text them right now after not talking for over a decade!! I am so excited for this!
Big shout out for their parent company to literally give you guys the rights to Smosh for the sole purpose of being respectful to your origins.   I remember watching the Pokémon Rap when I was in middle school. Smosh was definitely my comfort channel. All my friends and cousins watched it, and all of our inside jokes were all quotes from your videos.   I'm so happy you guys are back and look forward to what the future holds.   Also... I know there won't be many throwbacks, but I hope to see at least one more Food Battle.
Ian was always the normal one Anthony has some family issues or something
too be honest wan i watch new Smosh it felt like ian was an outsider
there is so much love here
When y’all bringing back ghetto smosh tho
Please “I spent a day with IAN’S MOM” next! Give the people what they want!
IM SOOOOO EXCITED AUGHHH
First off, YAY SMOSH IS BACK WOOOO!!! Second off, Anthony, your shoes are super cool and I need to know where you got those. I want a pair like that, they’re so stylish!
nah that ending made me want to cry
I used to watch smosh when I was in middle school (I'm 26 now 😅) and was absolutely obsessed. I stopped watching as often sometime during the defy era. I can't remember if I was still actively watching before anthony left or if I stopped watching after. Either way, the sketches never felt quite the same for a long time and I avoided the channel, but eventually I found my way back with the try not to laugh videos and things like that and I've come to really like the current cast. The news that Anthony is coming back and you guys own the channel again is so exciting and its making me want to go back and watch the old sketches, which I havent watched in YEARS. It was bittersweet watching them knowing that you guys weren't working together, but now it will be happy nostalgia knowing we will soon be getting more content like it 🥰 very excited to see what the future holds for you two and the channel!! 💕
FRIENDSHIP ALWAYS WINS
love you guys
Omg it’s happening
Two types of metrosexuals
Congratulations guys!
This is so so so so CRAZY
Sasuke and Naruto right here
LEAK THE OG SMOSH MOVIE SCRIPT PLEASE
Damn, for sure I need to look this video man
You guys are too humble. You two pioneered and made the internet.
Foot Battle 2023?
The brilliant thing about this is that it isn’t just the conversation we always wanted but that I’ve never seen Ian so serious and not just goofing around
i can imagine old smosh smells like sunscreen and/or water park water
I wanna smosh your faces together
This is definitely two friends healing ive not seen anthony be this genuinely relaxed with another interview or able to fully relate,
I remember watching you guys get lunch every week when I was a kid! Missed the pair!
So indirectly the one who created smosh was the science teacher.
Man I had no idea just how much Ian and Anthony’s friendship had fallen apart. This was an amazing conversation to watch and listen. Kudos boys, and welcome back Smosh. Looking forward to the new content❤️
Sounds like they’re both deeper ppl than they give each other credit for. Stop being awkward! You metrosexuals are so weird…poke some fun at each other
stop, i LOVED smosh sm:(
Smosh!!
Now we need Ryan Higa to start making videos on Nigahiga again
bro i’m so happy they bought smosh back and are talking abt everything that happened!!!❤ but honestly i need smosh sketch comedy abt all the stupid shit that the billionaires are doing… like ruining twitter and going to sea the titanic in a death trap…. LMAO
so happy
Ambutakum
I really hope SMOSH is good again. To usher in a new era
When is Food Battle 29 coming out??
Dude I just wanna see them eat lunch together and answer some Twitter questions
w rhett and link
this is a huge moment in youtube history seriously
Im About to have a smoshathon now watching those old videos
55:00 Anthony explains why content cop was successful and how Idubbbz could still be true to his roots if he just went for crowdfunding. He's too fargone now though :/
I saw the thumbnail when this was first uploaded. 2 days later now that I’m watching it I actually put together that fact that you guys are the two half of OG smosh 😂
So insane seeing them in the same room again
This video is so wholesome 100% big chungus elon musk gold award
Bottom line is YouTube kills quality content
You should spent a day with Patrick !!! (the guy who dubbed smosh in spanish)
For the last 2 days, I am literally watching all these content related to you guys. I think I am going crazy, I've watched the first videos of Smosh for the first time as well...
*sighhhh*... time to google for that milk fanfiction then
I'm 25 today, in other words, one of those kids who was watching. Looking back I see that your content was extremely inspiring and you definitely sparked a creative heart inside of me.
Shout out to Anthony for spending a day with this guy Ian from Make-A-Wish. Must've been a long day....but the thought of knowing you just made this kid with the really bad bowl cut hairdo's whole day and year and life, probably makes it worth it <3
Man to see successfull people come out from SacTown feels so great 😅
happy for you guys’ friendship
**LISTEN FANFIC WRITERS**  You cannot kill Mykie off UNLESS she becomes a ghost that haunts y'all
So sad to see how capitalism has shaped Ian and made him commit to Smosh. It's scary losing all your finances to your OG channel, but the channel was not your identity. I'm glad Anthony listened to his feelings and quit. Capitalism truly destroys everything including friendships
Bro I BOUGHT THE DISK Bro fym
“Smosh was a comfort channel to come people.” on those dark days… when I knew I was nothing… when I knew the world was gonna keep me down… the only thing that would help… Food Battle 2006…
Well you guys record a lot of footage in one day!!!
Stop saying like
I haven’t cried in joy in a long time. Thank you both for being you.
I’ve had this same friendship  problem happen over business, I’ve excepted for years now we aren’t ever gonna be friends again. Ian’s very relatable
They.. finally got back together..
this made me unbelievably happy. so glad yall are back! 🥺
ISMFOF....that is all
so strange how my interest as such a young kid is coming back to life when i’m a young adult. so happy!
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY
WHERES LUNCHTIME WITH SMOSH?! C:
Mi pregunta es que dirá el vídeo no se inglés
Man the story of Smosh would make a great movie!
Nothing hut feel’s awesome vibes 🥹 Our bois are bac-SHUT UP
Smosh was the first channel I ever watched on YouTube as a kid. Seeing you two reconcile and bring your amazing relationship back to smosh makes my inner kid so happy
❤
um...what the fuck is a milk fanfic
These guys were my childhood. I'm so happy to see them back together.
guys, I'm so happy about this. pls bring back the mail time.
THIS is the type friendship i want man.
Please bring back the old haircuts plzzzzzzz
INTERVIEW WITH RHETT AND LINK AND IAN.
Ian finna screw Anthony again
Bro spent half his life with Ian, we miss smosh
Bro spent half his life with Ian, we miss smosh
And the movie was beautiful
To this day i remember dixon cider 😅
Honestly having watched gmm and smosh for a decade  this is beautiful it's almost like Rhett and link knew this was going to happen and kept the seat warm I almost got teary eyed love this
Smosh was legendary
1:11:30 True Love
I love that you found your friendship again :)  makes me think back to my old friend who has been the only one to make me ROFL irl like crazy! maybe some time in the future we can reconnect too :)
Ok this is super cool, but I cant get over the fact that Anthony’s outfit makes him look like eren yaeger in season 4 💀💀💀
Bruh Rhett and link are sick for their reaction about hearing Anthony wanting to come back, pog champs frfr
"We never express emotions like this with eachother" "I still wont"  😂😂😂😂😂
this is gonna be…fucking emotional. i literally grew up with the classic smosh 😭
this was so refreshing to watch, this was an amazing rollercoaster of emotions
I love yall  and have since i was 13 and yall were just starting this is so beautiful ❤
I don't think Smosh was that well known in the Netherlands at the time, but I loved it when in the early 2010s I found another girl in college who also loved these videos. I don't know whether Smosh can get back to what it was, or whether it even should be the same again. But I'm glad to see two friends back together. That was the best part of Smosh, same as Rhett and Link. The great friendship and humor.
Just you know Smosh making giggles for eight years olds. I’m so happy that they are back. Also hearing that Ian was the optimist is hilarious to the contrast of Papa Ian we have now.
While I was sad to see Anthony leave Smosh seeing how that channel was my entire Sophomore and Senior year of highschool, I also understood why he had to go. I've been watching these guys since their Pokemon video and seeing them split felt truly like it was the end of an era. I'm glad to see that both Ian and Anthony were able to not only divide, but conquer the internet respectively. These two guys are pretty inspiring. To be delt a bad hand and still come out on top is like a movie script in the making. Hearing that they finally got back what they worked so hard to create was the highlight of my week.
"if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you..." nahhh, this got my teary-eyed. I'm so happy that you have rekindled your friendship. :)
As someone who has never spend money on a YouTuber or their content when you guys discussed making classic style smosh video funded by the YouTube membership program in order to avoid demonization I was immediatly onboard, as long as the monthly amount is something can afford I can promise you I will be signing up and because how massive of an impact you too have had on people’s lives I am very certain that there will be many more people like me who will be willing to pay for your content if it returns to form.
My childhood right here man so happy you guys have come full circle again!
ily guys<3
GUYS THE GANG IS GETTING BACK TOGETHER
I pray for the return of metrosexual hipster 🙏🏽
My all time favorite smosh video was..... buying a new car.... are tho cup holders! Lmfao!!!
Seeing you both together again is incredible! Looking forward to the future of Smosh and learning Rhett & Link are involved in this whole story is mind blowing!
"Damn it.... a fence!" still lives in my head rent free to this day <3
Whoever thought Smosh was a kids channel, clearly never watched a sketch from them.
It starts with F and ends with uck  Firetruck
I don't watch Smosh much. I grew up with them on YouTube. I stop before the movie came out. I did cry hearing Anthony and Ian bought Smosh back. It's such a comeback story from these two. Good luck to them both.
Okay, kinda a long shot, but how amazing would it be to get some cameos from some people Anthony has interviewed on this channel? I’m thinking Britney Broski, idubbz, Hasan Abi and any other funny creators he hit it off with. I’d LOVE to see some crossover where applicable So happy for you guys 💖💖
this is so wholesome!
The original Mordecai and Rigby
This is a video we've all been waiting for. And it finally came..❤❤
I’m going to need that link to the milk fanfic 👀
Back in my middle school days, watching Smosh grow more and more and then later on in the years hearing Anthony leaving Smosh and doing his thing and then coming back now is so heart warming. These guys really helped me escaped the pressures of school and growing up. They always reminded me that life can’t be all boring and dull. I’m glad that Smosh is coming back again ❤️‍🩹
In 2006, I was 5 years old, at 4 my brothers started sneaking the 3 of us on our dads gaming computer and listened to music and played dumb games so by 5 I was already well versed in the keyboard language, I went to the place we went to to listen to music on day and I saw a lipsinking video of the Pokémon theme song, after that day my life was never the same, I was a smosh fan threw and threw, I watched every video, I spent days just watching smosh, I loved that shit, it was so funny and there was so much content. Eventually smosh sold the company and things got really good... at first, they slowly started deteriorating when they started adding all the people and all the garbage, then i stopped watching... I missed this, I missed Ian's mom it's crazy I grew up with you guys like my earliest formative memories are of you, your like my older brothers
OMG YESSSS YESSS YESSS missed you two so much cant wait to see the smosh renaissance
you guys got me into YouTube this brings a tear to my eye been watching since 2009
Don't let Ian's shell confuse you, some people have to put up a barrier and their emotions show in subtle ways.
As someone who has grown up with Smosh, who remembers reacting to each and every one of these ups and downs, I think no matter what comes next the sheer fact that this is happening is amazing. I am so happy for you both.
This might be the deepest hour on YouTube
This might be the deepest hour on YouTube
This might be the deepest hour on YouTube
I think in terms of ideas, maybe Mr Beast would have some ideas in the bag :) would be cool to see a collab
Sorry but can we just take a moment to appreciate that LIKE TO DISLIKE RATIO
I knew my prayers to Happy Cow would someday be answered. All hail our lord and savior.
You guys dont look 35 at all, still look like youre in your 20s
I think Ian subtly ousted Anthony believing he’s the only funny one. As someone who watched the very first videos I can guarantee people thought Anthony was just as funny if not more so.
Damn this is some real love! You guys said what you guys needed to say, but in the end it all worked out, becase you guys love each other, amazing friends to each other. Awesome shit!
I'm so glad you two have become friends again. The authors of my childhood - I have so much to thank you both for.
Christ this is insane man, these guys were such a big part of my childhood. Amazing to see them together again.
So glad you boys are back together driving the Smosh ship. separate question.....where are those chairs from? lol
wow an actual real life cannon event this had to happen
As someone from the home city/ highschool we're all so happy to have you guys back together.
All I’m saying is that Food Battle 2023 needs to happen!
The Mortal Kombat video was the first video i ever saw by you guys and I never realized it was an old smosh video until years later lol
If Rhett and Link ever retire they should consider you two for their replacements.
I laughed with you guys when you mentioned your viewers being 10 years old then had the harsh realization that I was one of those kids. 18 years man..
So I may have missed it, but are the interviews still continuing on this channel or Smosh? This interviews are fantastic.
one of my fav videos is  the assassins video so funny TBAG!!
The world is healing
So happy there back together 😢❤ best wish for everything you do 🙌👌
I think we have now discovered.. Anthony and Ian are each other's ying to their yang.. different but it just works!
LUNCHTIME WITH SMOSH COMEBACK???????
I love you two. I used to spend my summer days alone in the house as a kid. Every single day I would make a cup o noodles and watch lunchtime with Smosh (even though I had to pre-load the videos lol) I think it made me feel less alone. 💚
I teared up a little. This is so exciting.
Drinking game: take a shot every time you mutter, "God they're gay" under your breath.  Nah fr I'm so happy for you guys!! Can't wait to see more Smosh!!!
SHUT! UP!
I think they are so brave. Ian for staying and keeping the ship afloat and Anthony for living his truth and rediscovering his creative voice.
I STILL remember the Dennys video and the waiter lmaoooo
I want an Ian Anthony podcast
Seriously can’t celebrate Links grace in the situation enough. What a compassionate response to the moment.
This is just a therapy session 💀
…I was one of those kids that was a big fan growing up, you guys were a big part of my childhood and this reunion is everything🙏🏻🩵
Oh dang ! I didn't realize they were on bad terms for a while. Feels good that they rekindled their friendship.
Please tell me they didnt take Happy Cow
I couldn't stop smiling throughout this whole interview. I'm so happy seeing you both reconnecting again and being in Smosh together again. This is truly amazing to see.
this healed my inner child
That news clip at the beginning really brought all the weight of this moment on me. This is so big.
I wonder who at smosh is editing the sketch video, manifesting Spencer 🫶🏼
these guys have a lot of chemistry they should make a channel together
im one of the kids that used to watch your videos 🥹
The ups and downs story between both of you two legendary YouTubers is definitely worth shooting a documentary movie or biography movie. 😢
I had to watch this
I’m 19 now
i enjoyed the movie:)
I waited for this for yearssss
1:10:30 Wholesome and nostalgically Smosh at the same time
“If we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do it with you.”  Fuck. Love these two. So happy for them.
I got so sad when you left smosh now when you guys are back my childhood feels like it was perfect 😢
i enjoyed lunchtime with smosh so much when i was younger, always made me think that they paved the way for the mukbang genre without even knowing it.
so this is very strange to say but after school i would use the bathroom and have very bad constipation. I would watch any smosh video just to help relax me so i could go. I know probably very strange to share but you guys actually helped me so thank you for making smosh.
These two are elder statesmen of online entertainment. Somehow, they’ve found a way to remain relevant and fresh in a constantly evolving space.
My inner child is crying watching this, seeing you guys rebuilding your friendship is so special
Sketch comedy does exist. RDC brings in views doing just that?
i’m 2 minutes in but i know i’m gonna cry  edit: yeah that hurted
I was one of those children 🙌🏼 loved smosh to pieces and when it changed it broke my heart
EPIC FOOD BATTLES 2023!❤🌶️🫔🌯🍩
Bro I've only watched 2 Smosh videos in my life and even I'm ecstatic about this reunion
Food battle 2023 🎉
AHHHH AWWWW OMG
*Damn...*      Y'all got me thinking about my estranged-ish sister, my drifting best friend, all the shit that's happened for any abstract period of time in my 29 years.... whew, but I love to see it, thanks for the glimpse into your lives over the years, guys <3
Ive been FUCKING WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEAAAAAAARS
fantastic watched every bit, you guys remind me of me and my best friend. you guys are gonna do great, loving the ideas, you both will thrive!
Like the fanfics ever stopped.
ngl i think they should turn this into a documentary
Why does Smosh remind me of blink-182.
Omg as someone who grew up on Smosh this conversation was so cathartic. I am so happy both of you found a way back to eachother ❤
Oh you know the fanfic is 100% coming back. Also, I think re-enacting some of those horrific fanfic would be great content... But probably mostly for us old-school Smosh connoisseurs, I don't know lol
My little millennial heart is so happy
The most epic episode EVER ❤🎉
Two best friends sitting in a studio 6 feet apart bringing up their fanfict to clarify they are not gay 🎶
Smosh The Movie 2 when?
No reconciliation kiss? :'(
I would definitely listen to a podcast of these two, not just with guests, but from time to time just talking among themselves, about their memories and feelings, as Rhett and Link sometimes did. I'm glad they got back together and I re-subscribed to Smosh. These guys are icons of the new era of the Internet, which began with the emergence of YouTube.
God we all grew so much eversince the disband of smosh, iIcan't wait to start watch you two again :)
Godamn, every OG smash fan and OG YouTube user has just had a wave a nostalgia. I can't wait man
1:02:28 I appreciate you guys not doing the whole nostalgic trip, but I stg if you don’t do another food battle I’ll be pissed
BRING BACK CHARLIE THE DRUNK GUINEA PIG
Another food battle pls.
smish has good genetics
I really miss some of my old friends
smish
I think I started watching you guys in 2013 when I was like 8 years old. You guys helped shape my sense of humor in a good way in my opinion and I still appreciate the videos that you guys made back then to this day which says a lot.
Two legends
watching smosh the movie on puttlocker as a kid was my first ever experience with piracy
bring back emo hair
Lunchtime with Smosh?
BRING BACK FOOD BATTLE!!!
After only 2 days there are 3 mil views
When I was a kid I always looked forward to the next instalment of Food Battle. Nice to see you both come together agian.
It is absolutely insane to be in the first 10 channels to get monetization. You need to get nigahiga on here
In 10 years there’s gonna be a movie about Smosh starting like the Social Network
Smosh was the first YouTube channel I ever subbed too. Was obsessed with their videos, welcome back together yall
Congratulations! My friends and I had such fun watching the pokemon video in 2006 😂
BOSE VS THE WORLD NEXTTT
:putnam:
This was such a mature, raw, honest, genuine conversation between two life-long friends & business partners and I absolutely loved it. I sincerely appreciate this video existing
My first Smosh video was... Pokemon Lip sync... oh yeah... the original one. 2005. Just got into college. I loved that channel so much. I keep watching Smosh 'till mid 2018, so many things stages of my life watching you guys. Beginning and graduation of college, my first job, my first convention, losing my first job, eye surgery, new relationships blooming, several broke-ups along the way... I'm so excited right now. I'm remembering so many things from all those years right now. Just remembered BoxMan song i started to laugh by my own. I hope you guys do more Food Battle. It's been more than 5 years without the pink frosted sprinkled donut pwned some nerds.
True men here mending their friendship and just getting over how awkward it might be initially
y'all two are soul brothers. idc if y'all had beef in the past. the way you two interact with eachother just gives off such brotherly vibes. you both know eachother so well even when y'all were at the point in smosh when you left anthony. its obvious that you guys have always cared for eachother. even when you may not have thought that was the case.  at least thats the way it looks like from the lense i'm looking through :) Love you guys! so happy to see you two back <3
please drop a skin care routine! I feel like you guys were older than me when I was a child and now we just look the same age lol
i have a chrome extension that shows dislikes, to all those 717 dislikes, fuck you all
I didn’t know they were famous on the news in the first place!
What a good year this is
Anthony is like a version of Ian that had a really intense Shrooms trip and came out the other side a changed man
Anthony leaving Smosh was his canon event
food battle 2023 when
Mailtime with you guys was sooo lit
This makes me wish I could see commentary from you guys from like really early smosh. Just like who thought of what or what the process was like. So, so excited for whats in store for you guys
I had just moved to a new town and my new friends introduced me to your channel, since then for 10 years I've been following you both.
"Go subscribe to SMOSH or you'll be a piece of shit, n you don't wanna be a piece of shit do you?" Deep down I think this is why I still am subbed after so many years, not just do avoid offhanded jokes but to truly bask in the greatness I hoped for and, even better, this situation. The heart never really left, it was just segmented for way too long. If you do burn it to the ground, I'm glad it's not with kerosene and tears but with this perfect match
Is Anthony gay ?
This brings me back to watching Lunch Time with Smosh. I really enjoy just hearing these two talk
this is great but they need to fire all those cringe extras of modern smosh.
The best opening should be a Food Battle !!!! Happy to see you back !!!!
18:59
🥹🥹💗❤️❤️ we love you guys
Ian pronouncing "ether" instead of other brought me back!!!
I watched Smosh right from the beginning and continue to quote you guys (to the point of annoying many people), although, i don't really watch the new stuff, but if you're both together again, i will!
Ian: So moral of the story, you’re saying I’m awesome? Cool thanks 😂😂  I’m obviously being sarcastic. You’re both awesome and I’m so happy for you both!!
With Smosh back yall should work with Dropout TV! Id kill to see yall on Game Changer and Make Some Noise
The gang is back!
How havent they aged in 20 years?
This will go down in history
Not me sittting here remembering the unedited Hanging out at Dennys at 11pm video and the managers offering you guys oxy 😂 i think about that video at least once a week  "Its 11:11! Make a wish🎉 "
"Even if it doesn't do well, I know this was the right thing. And if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you."  what a raw line, straight from the heart
bring back food battle
Cyberspace celebrities 😂 this story is so wholesome though
I love how open and honest they both are in this interview. I love both Anthony and Ian, and I am so happy that they have found each other again ❤ I can’t wait to see the new content!
'no no that was very appropiate' *proceeds to censor it* lol
This brought back so many memories, I wasn't a huge fan of the comedy skits but I loooved lunchtime with smosh.
I mean, those kids that were watching you guys back then are adults now
Congratulations on successfully opening old wounds and achieving what many dare never to try. We all have friends that were lost to us. They always come to mind in the quietest of moments!!!!! Good eye R&L for !etting it happen. PS the accidental setting on my phone that made your tats super cool was inversion
Bruh those kids are now 23 years old, with loans and jobs curing themselves watching this video. I never thought I would live to see this.
Y'know?
My childhood.
Ok I agree with going for fresh instead of nostalgia, but I want food battle 2023
The therapy session we all needed
I was like 10 years old when I found smosh. Iam now 23. You guys set the bar for my comedy taste and iam looking forward to seeing new content that you both believe in. This is wholesome af
sooo... we are getting another food battle video or not??
Oh my god... im like... an adult now... i started watching smosh in elementary
bros. i think you both need mentorship from rhett and link to make a root. observe their style, leadership, system, partnership, friendship, brotherhood,openess, etc.. to be both of you to grow a little more prepared in handling and owning a business with a brother.      or do whatever you want as long you enjoy. im not an expert this is just my suggestion as a fan.
man i remember buying the smosh movie when i was a kid and i loved it 😭😭
I LOVE smosh the movie. i used to watch it like everyday growing up. just watched it again yesterday since you bros announced youre back, and it still holds up for me to this day. So nostalgic.
The title alone sent me, lmao. I was hooked on you clowns when I was in middle school. Crazy
You can tell a couple minutes in this conversation was pretty healing and the fear they had of it being awkward or bitter melted away. Again I haven’t watched either of these guys in a decade, my ex girlfriend watched some of these interviews videos and I liked them enough but didn’t really seek them out on my own. But for some reason this popped up and I had to see just bc I was there when those early days were happening, I remember YouTube being invented and it’s such a trip now
Smosh the movie was perfect in my opionion I loved every second of it
This is so awesome! I remember watching smosh videos all the time with my cousin when we were younger. I cannot wait to see what y’all have planned for the future 🖤🥰✨
Personally as an old fan from like 2006-2011 or so, I think the smosh movie really messed em up. Both of em, they just sucked and they knew it
Amazing news! This was incredible to watch. You both were so honest and reflective.  You both have showed a lot of maturity to come together and  to heal after everything that has happened. I have recently started to heal old friendships that were damaged as well. It requires a lot to set aside your ego, to really listen to each other. Love is so important and  necessary for healing. ❤
those last few minutes had me all choked up. ian saying there's no one he'd rather burn it all down with, topped with anthony's reaction.... boys.. all the best to both of you ❤
Literally the homeless bald sketch.
Idea of ,,I spend a day with..'' Coryxkenshin
This feels so meta
The story of these guys needs to be a big budget drama film. It's such a crazy story.
BRING BACK THE CELEBRITY PRANK INTERBIEWS
WERE BACK BABY
First video I’ve watched from either of these guys since like fun with Ian or whatever it was called
stoked
I'm so hyped up, and a bit turned on.
This is brilliant stuff guys ❤
This is definitely the most anticipated comeback story in YouTube history
I was there for some of the earliest Smosh videos. It was some of my favorite entertainment to watch. They introduced my to the band I Set My Friends On Fire. As I grew up, I moved away from the channel. This makes me so happy to see the two of you not only back in control of the channel, but also rekindling your friendship. Congratulations
Ian: ahaha [cough] w-wouldn't it be hilarious if we bought smosh-  Anthony: [jumping up] uNLESS???? 😳😳😳
Straight up stoked . good for you guys. 🎉
This is the pog,
I never realized that there were so much drama behind the scenes, but now that I watched this video I'm more excited than ever for the return of Smosh.
Okay Lunchtime with Smosh when
great hug <3
I love seeing you both together again. I watched the fireball car video last night and my jaw was on the floor with the line “let’s get out of hereeee” because I say that all the time and had no idea where it came from. Congrats to you both 💕
Ooo that 1:11:00 moment, my heart!  that was the most unguarded moment from Ian in this whole thing.
This somehow got me super emotionnal
The issues of creating something bigger than yourself is that ther is a possibility that you loose control of it. And it is very rare that you get back that control. Congrats man. You guys did it. 🗿🎉
This seriously makes me tear up to watch. I'm just so happy
w
these dudes sitting here with clean trims and glasses/tats and stuff pretending like they ain't the two goofiest mfs on this planet
I only cried twice. This is insane, considering I am the same age as you guys and kind of followed all of this as well.. Thank you for everything and whatever you do in the future, I'll keep supporting you. You're both GREAT individuals!
42:00 Ian wtf???
The boys are back in town
Are you still making videos here?
I’m literally about to be 21 I miss the old shit
The magical duo together again it’s so beautiful
Man, I miss when people would say shit like CyberSpace celebrities 😭
I remember seeing the first Smosh video. Legend of Zelda Rap. It was shared on Google+ 😂
u guys in my eyes are probably the godfather of the godfathers of youtube.
The Audio is so bad on this, Only when Anthony speaks
Proof Healing is in Time itself ❤️‍🩹
It has been almost 20 years and they still pretend his name isn't Lan.
1:07:53
It's funny how I did not grow up with smosh. Totally missed that era. I discovered Anthony through Mykie and started watching his stuff too. It's cool to see him thriving.
i really want to see anthony in a video of smosh that they are making without him, like a game show or somehting they did.
I’ve been watching you guys since 2006, I missed the days after you guys sold the channel but this is beautiful to see and am very happy for you guys 😭
I thought this happened only in movies....congrats to both,
this made m day and such a smile to my face!!!
I would love to see Ethan Klein on this channel.
I cried... Grew up with you guys in early high school, you both helped me a lot becoming fluent in english and I always had a soft spot Smosh. So fun. I'll be happy to support whatever you guys come up with together
alright so now we can finally get another foodwars right
I miss being a kid watching Smosh.
I’ll upgrade my damn membership if you tell me to do so fuck the money take my wallet
41:59 😂😂😂❤
I’m
My daddies are back together ❤🥺🥺
Happy Cow, Part II? :D
This video gave me tears of joy ,Smosh was a huge part of my childhood and loved watching  they’re skits  was very good entertainment and brought joy to my life at that time as well 😎🙏
Used to binge watch Smosh back in the day. Great to see it!
This is awesome thank u for coming back
Food Battle 2023.
That’s always really cool when you can have a friend that long
41:55 🤣😂
Food battle 2023 !!
I think what Anthony was basically saying towards the end is that this channel allows him to explore more adult concepts and themes while Smosh allows him to express his inner child/teenager. Both are insanely important and I'm so glad he's reconnected with his friend and refound an old passion.
this feels like the kobe and shaq interview
Please please please bring back lunch time with smosh!
I loved the smosh game
I can't wait for Ian to do a submarine joke next TNTL
From strangers to lovers to strangers again
Please do Joji 😢
I don't know any of the people in Smosh. Ian and Anothony are the face of Smosh.
32:53
this was so wholesome 😊 this was so satisfying to watch hearing the clear communication and being completely vulnerable, it felt like a therapy session but in the best way.. also I LOVE Anthony’s tattoos, I kept staring at them, they’re so unique - it reminds me of Hades with the lines in Lore Olympus. both their outfits are on point 👌🏻 great video all around. I’m happy for you guys 🤗
Ian and Anthony relationship is the one that one bro would say 'I miss you' and the other one doesnt think about him at all when they are away.
I feel like you guys still has some walls up here or there but I’m glad you guys are working through past(and maybe present) complications to rekindle that age old friendship.
So happy for y’all, sounds like you’ve both grown a lot emotionally. As an old and current fan, I know y’all don’t want to lean into nostalgia but just imagine how well a food battle would do with how much food content trends now 🥺
holy shit i expected, but didnt expect this to happen, and now it did, im in shock. thank you guys for being there when i grew up, love yal
I CANNOT WAIT FOR FOOD BATTLES!! 🍩
This is such a bittersweet sort of video. It feels so nostalgic, and it’s so good to see friends that went their separate ways , meet and talk about it. I think we’ve all been in that sort of situation with friendships ending, and this is exactly how we’d wish to meet with that person again.   So excited to see what smosh does :)
lmaoo i saw the title of the video and i was like “if hes gonna do ian is he gonna do anthony” and i forgot YOU were Anthony Padilla loll
I remember watching Smosh as a kid, I barely even knew English at the time but it never stopped me from enjoying every single video I watched. It’s so weird but so exciting seeing you guys back. So surreal.
i use to watch them while in 4th -5th grade i’m 21 now 😂
I have always told people it’s hard work growing as a person. It can take a lifetime but it’s truly worth doing the work. Often you will have to walk away from relationships to let go of the hurt. If someone is meant to be in your life they will always find their way back. Growing is hard and often when you are young you can’t see the big picture or understand and communicate properly. I’m so happy they found their way back to each other. It’s a happy day and they both have grown into great men. Congratulations to them both. I wish them a very happy future.
Omg nostalgiaaa been watching you guys since MK and Pokemon themes! Then way later i remember the i set my friends in fire birds and the bees/maturity talk or whatever lol
i went to the same highschool and middle school ian and anthony went to and it was always weird knowing they could’ve met in this same room
This is the best thing since sliced bread!
Not the milk fic 😭😳
“It’s just business” was the initial fall out.
Why does this feel like soldiers or sailors or something reuniting after years apart fighting for different sides of a war
SMOSH FOOD BATTLE COMING BACK?
You guys making my whole fuvking week when I needed it. Love you guys
FRIENDSHIP ALWAYS WINS 🫸🏻💥🫷🏻
I lowkey miss the food battle game so if you can pls bring it back🥺
Why does this sound like a love story?
We need Anthony to get Aaron and JonTron together to do this.
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
I'm so happy I actually can rn
Lots of fond memories from Smosh, they really crafted the way people consume content and how comedy on the internet differed from TV. One of my favourite creations Smosh came out with was the cartoons channel, I watched so many of them and were the first channel with consistent seasons and shows that I followed
Anthony if you see this, PLEASE BRING BACK SMOSH LIBS🥺🥺🥺
When you made smoxsh I was 16 months old  And now I'm 18
I'm beginning to believe that 2023 is the best year of our generations lives
I'm glad Anthony left, because if he didn't he would have the money to buy Smosh back, thanks to Anthony we can get Smosh back and thanks to Ian there's a Smosh to get back
anthony looks like a lesbian
Loved this, these two were my childhood along with so many others and it’s interesting to hear how they’ve gotten to where they are now
Please bring back Stevie in your future sketches!
1:36 did they say this story before? i already knew what ian was gonna say before he said it. trippy
im 20 years old and remember watching Smosh when I was in 3rd and 4th grade and they used to have me rolling on the floor laughing. It's so nostalgic seeing them together again. I hope they continue to do what is funny for them and that they don't try and appeal to anybody. I think that's the main reason I had stopped watching Smosh as a kid because after Anthony left, Smosh felt less genuine.
I’ve missed the channels from old youtube and I’m really happy you guys are back! You guys were apart of my childhood!
Just need a double-decker twerk to commemorate this moment
anthony crying was too sweet <3
Anthony leaving smosh is a canon event.
I personally loved the movie
I love you guys can’t wait to see smosh return
Idk if anyone will see this but will things like Food Battle be coming back? Or are all of those old series done?
i am in tears
"If we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you." I'm in TEARS
That's a interview with interviewing the entire life of the interviewer
Return of the Kings
I'm pretty sure Anthony's spent more than one day with Ian
31:15 = Link Outfit and Assassin Creed Outfit probably being sold for Thousands of dollars because it was worn by Ian and Anthony..
hope this starts a new era of youtube , so proud of you guys, you made my childhoof and my teenage years that much bearable thx for everything!
Full circle damnnnn. So happy for you guys
<3
This is the youtube equivalent of avengers endgame
Adal ramones y jordi rosado vibes
I am SO happy! It's incredible to see you guys again!
honestly a break is so key
😭🥺🥺🥺 ommg never thought id see the day. 🙏
Whatever happen to rest of the crew? I missed lasercorn, sohinki, jovenshire, and Mari
i still remaember the first time i watch smosh is when i am bout 8, and now i am 22, what a good old day. smosh bring me a lot good memory and fun .
Why isn't Smosh linked in the description
Appealed to me lol
feels like im 11 watching you guys play with jelly filled donuts again
Food battle 2023 The pink frosted sprinkled donut is returning 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let’s. Goooo been subscribed since middle school with food battle and the Justin Bieber video lol
I can’t wait to see the new smosh skit ❤️ really happy for you guys!!!
Props to Rhett and Link for supporting smosh all these years and letting Ian and Anthony own it again. ❤️
Please release Beef’n’Go. I need my protein on the go.
I predict this like 5 years ago, I mean I predicted that it would happen in 2024 but still
Who remembers watching these guys when we were younger, kinda crazy  to see that they split apart and now are back together when no one thought they would.  it's like we're re living our childhoods now but as adults 😭
11:50 = things started getting better; the energy got better
41:55 ian was ready to cry you can see it
I think this was very much needed it felt like a conversation rather than an interview thank you for making this I'm so happy to see you together again
BOXMAAAN BOXMAAAN BOXMAN HAS GOT A BOYFRIEND!!!?? 🫨🫨🫨
I want a smosh docu/biopic
MY CHILDHOOD HEROES
Never really cared for Smosh or these guys but, I'm really glad for them considering their story and how badly they got screwed. It is quite wonderful to see such a success story.
I am definitely becoming a smosh member. You guys were my childhood I'm happy to pay a little a month to bring og smosh back!
This video was so cute I love you two
Felix would be proud and so would everyone else.
bruh the story that Anthony and Ian share with the smosh channel is incredible. It should have really been used as the plot of the Smosh movie. Seriously a goldmine
Idk why, I still feel the passive aggressiveness between them lmao
Look at Ian go, being a guest on a show he's never seen a full episode of 🩷
They've both grown so much ahhhhhh I'm not crying you are
The thing and people that are meant for you will never pass you by.
SHUT UP!
Excited to see you two work together again.
I'm probably the 7 millionth person to say this but oh my god, this episode is very cathartic. I started watching Smosh when I was like 8 years old.
Sacramento hometown team coming back again hell yes 🔥 grew up around Carmichael/citrus heights
better bring back food battle tho
Man it's so beautiful to see these men have been on a healing journey that brought them back together. I'm 29 now but my middle school self was obsessed with smosh. Watching them go to Denny's on a crappy digital camera was so fun to me! As I got older I guess I could tell they didn't have their heart in it anymore so I stopped watching. So excited to see them put out stuff that they enjoy making again!! Just have fun together guys that's what we all will enjoy! ❤
Props to Anthony’s partner Mykie and Ian’s friend Dianna for playing a huge part in anthony and Ian reconnecting as friends and reuniting their magic as smosh
instantly do the most smosh thing ever - the goofy butt hug
crying in the club <3
Creative Soulmates
I love how absolutely average Ian looks and seems, but we all know he is far from it 😎
idk if its just me or something, but ian kinda.. makes me sad. like he just.. feels so conflicted. they talk about how he was positive, and seemingly pushing away frustrations and even kinda closing off himself when anthony said he would get emotional and said 'i still wont'. it sounds like he has so may reservations and a strong desire to appear / be strong, be for his child or whatever.. idk. i feel concerned. but i know he doesnt need random people to speculate
i loved you guys growing up smosh was the first channel i ever watched on youtube shit i was probably 9/10 and im 20 now
This is a day fans never thought would happen. But we are so happy it is
They are truly the sun and moon ❤
Thank god those billionaires imploded and fixed the timeline
Legends of Zelda smash vid will still be my favorite video of all time def gonna go watch that rn
Its crazy knowing I basically grew up watching both you and Ian and then see that grow and disappear before coming back stronger. I started crying when you guys talked about what happened between you guys because I’ve had similar experiences. I also had a close friend of mine who felt the same way I did after we had this large disconnect and after 3 years of barely speaking with each other, we finally were able to reconnect so it makes me so happy to see you guys reconnect to. I really hope to see how sick your stuff would be together.
I cant believe im subscribed to smosh again, i never thought this would happen. Beyond excited
The both of you are so swell.  I can’t wait for the sketches 🎉
I’m happy you guys are back together again 😊. Enjoy yourselves!
I was smiling the whole episode
I dropped everything to watch this
Awesome. Now I want NigaHiga to comeback too 😩
First thing that should come back with Anthony. Smosh summer games!!!
Dammit im crying
Is Boxman coming back too?
So… Food Battle 2023 when?
You guys need to do more podcasts together i love hearing you guys banter with eachother it really makes me smile and feel like a part of my childhood is still here, i was really worried about how everything was going to work out but you covered all my worries in this podcast, love you guys and never stop doing the things you do
I miss lunchtime with Smosh
With tik tok on the rise, I think we all yearn for the old days where youtube was funny and authentic! Hopefully it's back on the rise.
So, I am kinda......crying here. You guys made my high school and early college days.
My little brother and I LOVED Smosh to the point we would recite the videos and act them out 😂When the movie came out our mom bought us a signed poster copy with the movie. We were literally flipping out ❤️ it hanged in my room for years. Thank you guys for the memories 🥰
This is so good
The only smosh movie they should make is a movie telling the story of smosh behind the cameras, like: "Smosh: backstage"
looks like Ian went full flordian pornstar and anthony has fully dived into the emo culture
Happy Smosh is coming back, grew up on smosh.
This is the youtube equivalent of Gta 6 releasing
Anthony, Ian, watching you two get back together and just.. talk . Made me tear up, you guys influenced who I am today I will never be thankful enough. Teleporting fat guy will always live in my heart. I love you guys, wish you all the best and hope someday I can get an autograph from both of you on a pokemon hat haha. All love
Do a video where you spend a day with Jehovah witness.
cant wait to see that dam flamingo again
I was a kid discovering you both and and it's definitely 70% of my childhood
I’ve never witnessed two men have such a mature conversation about emotions.  I’m really happy for the both of you, your conversation definitely gave me some food for thought for my own life.
YEEEESSSSS!!!!
I hope this goes well, not for the fans, or the views, or the money, or even the legacy…but for Anthony and Ian to have that connection and friendship again ♥️
Still love the movie
If Smosh made it back solo, and ERB made it back solo, when is =3 gonna return? @raywilliamjohnson
Time to resubscribe!
This is the best
Why's this whole video got me so emotional? ❤😢 Smosh has always been more than just Ian and Anthony but you guys have always been the root of it. I've watched the transformations and have enjoyed seeing you both grow into yourselves. Might not mean much but I'm proud of the two of you and the maturity you've displayed and I will not be a piece of shit and will stay subscribed ❤
About damn time
I love ians honesty in this. Hopefully he does want to rebuild his relationship with anthony and enjoy what hes doing rather than solely focusing on the business and financial side of this because i got the impression anthony is doing this out of love for smosh and wanting to reconnect with Ian
My inner child is crying happy tears watching my 2 favorite creators as a kid rekindle a non toxic masculine relationship just being people and understanding each others pains and differences. Genuinely awesome!
Just like a lot of people here, I grew up watching Smosh when it was just Ian and Anthony. I grew up watching Food Battle, Ian is Bored, and Smosh Pit Weekly. Every time I come across their older videos, a wave of nostalgia hits me and I am reminded of what peak YouTube entertainment was. I am forever grateful for their commitment to creating quality comedy sketches and parodies because watching them always takes me back to a much simpler time. They are the reason why I have the sense of humor I have today. And I am sure that I am just one out of a million others who are now in their 20s but share the same feelings/experience towards the original Smosh videos from late 2000s to early 2010s.
I’m so happy my childhood is coming back
ok interview Ghetto smosh next !!
SHUT UP
Waiting for food wars 2023
I remember watching your first videos when YouTube was still in its infancy. Literally some of the best summers of my life were spent with my brother and I spending mornings watching those videos.  I hope that you guys take Smosh in the direction that you want it to go. Don’t be constrained to thinking that it has to be a certain way.
20:50
So incredibly happy and excited for both of you!! Your Pokémon theme song parody video was the first YouTube video I ever watched and it was back in 5th grade on the last day of school. I grew up with Smosh and I’m so happy to see how much you’ve both grown and that you’ve reconnected so much. Really wishing you guys the best
Shut up, I didn’t cry, you did!! Also I know this is weird to say, but Ian has had a glow up. Like wowie zowie. This man is my type
Seeing "Co-Owner of Smosh" next to Ian's name just hits so differently after all this time. Thank God Smosh is back in both of your hands! 😭😍😭😍❤
I love you both so much, I'm so happy for you guys and definitely will be supporting the new Smosh content from now on, I grew up watching your videos and even learned English so I could understand the jokes better!
Im just gonna say i didn't really grow up watching the main channel like i didn't even know that it exists but since the beginning of smosh games the gamebang and maricraft stuff that was my heaven i watch smosh games every time the channel uploads a video and my only wish with this renaissance i could see the old smosh games again.
Will there ever be a food battle 20xx? I think a video like that would be a great welcome back to Smosh video. But please just make the videos that keep you guys happy. Stay well
1:11:57 honestly I think it’s the right thing too. If it’s gonna go down, it should go down because of the people who started it.not some company who just threw the money around.  But I really don’t think it’s gonna fail.
Congrats to smoosh i miss yall so mucb but I'm glad your still with mickey i miss her 😭
and they lived happily ever after
afgahaghgajigxuciai as???!!?!?
I am subscribed to Smosh once more. May the Gods see your renewed endeavors with jovial laughs.
Thank you guys so much for this, I am so damn excited to see what new content you guys release. Been watching since food battle 2009 and loved the skit content
dios LOS AMO
2023 getting a lot better
wow. okay i thought this was finally a collab - to clickbait - to realising its the biggest thing that could have happened. and yes its scary. but im glad that ian said it was the right thing, and he's ready to burn it all together with anthony at the end. this is truly touching and inspiring, seeing how reconciliation and anything is possible.
i started watching you guys when i was like 7 and i’m 18 now
god like Ian like says like a lot
It's kinda weird to see the duo sitting together, not in smosh but in Anthony's interview, talking about the good old days of making everything from nothing. It makes me cry when Anthony and Ian was chatting about the legendary adventure both of them had walked, and got seperated. All those precious memories came back.
BRB gonna go cry now
Respect for Rhett and Link: 📈📈📈  They really are the dads of YouTube.
This was low-key beautiful but Ian is kinda being a dick am I the only one noticing this? It's beyond dry humor
So happy that you guys bought smosh I’m ready to relive my childhood
are we sure that ian really is not sociopath?
This is the best thing i have seen in a while
I'm 35, I was born in 1987 and graduated high school 2006. Smosh was a GIANT part of my teenage years, as was YouTube. Phil DeFranco, Jenna Marbles, Smosh, Chales Trippy... man those were the YouTube days!
It is so refreshing to see people talk about the good and the bad in such an open way, about their own feelings, emotions and experiences. Exciting for the future :D
I hope food battle comes back
Man they both click so well, they should start a channel together.
This is all so nostalgic and exciting, im so glad Rhett and Link are the amazing people they are that allowed this to happen
What's the milk fanfic
I AM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW!
also the real anthony laugh at 51:40 is funny af
51:40 THIS GIVES SUCH OLD SMOSH VIBES
Food battle 2023?
I reckon they get back the old haircuts bc of this
I started watching smosh (really just smosh pit) after Anthony left so I never knew him or had the nostalgia for old smosh, but this was so touching and I found myself tearing up, so happy for everything coming back full circle, and so happy to have Anthony rejoin Smosh at the helm with Ian <3
God you guys were such a huuuuge part of my entertainment growing up, I remember Towards Anthony leaving how crushing it was to start realizing things were going to different. Having you back is a desperately needed spark of joy in an otherwise grim and stressful world
Congrats you two! This makes my heart so happy for you and your team!  Listening to this was so nostalgic but it hurt my heart a little because I was one of those people that called Anthony "Smosh" after the split. (To be fair I hadn't watched Smosh in years.)  I was an editor for a growing YouTube channel that had recently been acquired by Defy. We got invited to the vidcon party on the industry floor, despite not being able to pay for industry passes, and I was overwhelmed! Looking around at this massive room of creators and celebrities, it felt like joining Defy meant that we had made it!   Then... Through the next year we started to see what Defy was up to, and it was not what we thought it was, and felt we were being taken advantage of.  The next year at vidcon, we were again invited to the Defy party... But this time it was tucked off in a small room to the side, and I'm going to be honest, it looked like a highschool group project. It was so confusing. And with some other things I had going on, I decided to slip away from everyone into a back hallway of the convention center.  It was just me alone in a hallway with my feelings, when Anthony, comes rushing past me. In the moment I couldn't remember his name so I just blurted "HEY SMOSH!" He stopped and whipped around and the pain that I saw in his face for that split second tore through me. He quickly put on a happy face and walked over and shook my hand and said to the tune of "Hey, I'm in a bit of a hurry, what's up" and I don't even remember what I said but it was a short thanking him for the years of content.   I'm weirdly glad to have had just that moment to thank at least half of Smosh for the years of content I watched growing up. No selfie, no autograph, just a moment of his time... I would later look Smosh up and realized Anthony was no longer part of Smosh... Oops.   If either of you somehow read this. Thank you for sitting down and doing this. I feel like a part of my childhood has now been reconnected! Plus this sets a good example for the next generation about making amends and taking things out, both of you are an inspiration!
I follow you guys since the beningign and i love how your styles evolved, like anthony is a modern emo y ian its full colors
Please make a food battle 2023
Played the drinking game every time they said the name "smosh", now I am 3 days sober and my cancer is cured. Thanks, Smosh.
R u guys best friends again or just friends
Ngl. Watching them both be mature after watching them be insane messes for my entire childhood is both weird and refreshing. I’m happy Smosh is back
I don't want to sound stupid, but am I the only one who thinks this looks like what it would be like if John Lennon and Paul McCartney talked about working together again or bringing the Beatles back together?
Welcome back boys we missed you.
this is basically the best marketing for therapy ever
i remember when youtube used to shows top 10 popular videos on their homepage at the bottom right, smosh was a regular there, along with nigahiga, jenna marbles, shane dawson, and rwj (=3).  a bit off topic and i really hate to be that guy, but goddamn now i miss old youtube.  - top 2 comments on top while the bottom are a bit random so you always see different kinds of comments - comments can actually get NEGATIVE likes and it'll show you - personalize channel page where you can upload a background, pick a color for the fonts and the square thing that i still dont know the name of (above the background but at the back of the fonts, basically like themes but you can only pick colors), and iirc even put someone else's video on your channel front page (bcs i could've sworn i put like a game trailer for my old account's page even though i was too dumb to know how to upload shit) - by today standard's all of the layout IS UGLY, but somehow felt more comfortable to look at, if that makes sense - people can leave a comment on your channel, and it'll be easy to find (like steam basically) - inboxes, though i only ever used it once to argue with someone - you can click on any videos, and keep clicking on the suggestion bar, and end up on some weirdest shit that you'll never find on today's youtube (because the suggestion bar actually ONLY shows videos that are related to the video that you're watching, not filled with videos from people you subscribed to with some 1-2 related videos)  very sad i forgot my password to my old account that uploaded copyrighted trailers for the game Dogz and Catz, its a part of a history. the "broadcast yourself" era when the "tube" is still in the red square will always be my favorite. smosh's reunion brings back memories
i was so confused when i first saw it cause i kinda gave up on smosh when they went their own ways, so to see them again is so awesome 🥺
in that year smosh is good for kids, yes we know its not for kids, but you know kids have grew its like we grew up with smosh and now children who watched smosh back in the year is us. kids turns adult now so the adult us now knowing that smosh is coming back it's like good news to us. i also feel bad that without anthony in smosh that time is like disappointing for kids (us). kids nowadays watch smosh without anthony in it they thought it was the best video they watched.
Thwse guys straight up hung out one time and said "screw this let's restart a og channel"
I would too see the reaction of staff and cast at smosh to them finding out about this lol.  So glad to see you guys rehealing and rekindling friendships!  best of luck!
Now I understand why business has been coming up in so many of Anthony's interviews lately. Congrats guys.
Am I the only one thinking first video back, just you two, in front  of a webcam lip syncing back street backs?
Babe wake up smosh are back together 📢📢📢📢
This is the most LA thing ive ever seen. I hate it
This would be a W Season Finale.
Man life has not been good but this makes me so fucking happy. I love you guys! (:
smosh was one of the main channels to start youtube, i remember as a kid watching their videos on my tablet laughing my a$$ off :)
I low-key want them to get married
What will happen with this channel tho~
Yay!
Do another JB video please
OG Smosh fan. Thank you for allowing us to listen to this really personal conversation. Was amazing to hear how things were behind the scenes after all these years and the growing process. Anthony tearing up almost made me cry too. Excited for what the future holds
As an OG YouTube user and fan of Smosh, getting this clarity and context for everything means a lot. For so long I'd felt like my parents had gotten a divorce, and nobody would tell me why. I'm so glad y'all got the channel back, and that y'all patched up your friendship! God Bless.
I wish Ian would be comfortable expressing himself and allowing himself to feel emotions. Its hard in this time and day, part of being alive is allowing yourself to enjoy things and be happy whilst also being sad and grieving for healing. I can tell anthony has a lot of emotions associated with Ian but its hard to tell with Ian himself. Even if it's just a business move its nice to see how theyve grown since then.
Make a Smosh summer games please
I think Anthony is the only one that really knows how to “yes and” with Ian
💩
You guys got me trough House arrest back in 2015. I'm so glad you guys are back!!
Bruh we counted. They are talking with a 20 LPM ("Likes" per min). I love you but you don't need to say "LIKE" every 5 sec
i haven’t finished the video yet but this video has “divorced couple reconnecting” energy
This has been fascinating to watch and listen to. I had seen some early day Smosh videos, I remember the day Anthony left and how much that took over the Internet even in sectors that weren’t really related, and seeing it come full circle back together is awesome. I hope this works out really well for you guys
You should get Nice Peter and Epic Lloyd on the show!
How many times did Ian say "like"?
This is so wholesome ❤😊
it’s okay. you can say defy media. we all know they suck
SHUT UP
I remember they mentioned that story of how they first got together in an episode of lunchtime with smosh, about drawing a huge dump.
So proud of you two for being able to be so real and vulnerable in here, it's very lovely to see you both talk about everything so truthfully and honestly. Very happy to see where this new path leads you❤️ and so excited to have you all back!!
Congratulations on getting Smosh back!!!! So happy for you all!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Time for Food Battle 2023 The Return
It's kinda weird how there are so many people in the comments still idolizing their relationship even after this interview.
Rhett and Link are like the proud dads letting their kids go on their own to grow and try to do something by their self. I believe if something comes up in the future they’ll be glad to be consultants to Ian and Antony they are afterall the dads of youtube
Woop woop!
make smosh great again❤
when I was diagnosed with Crohn's my appetite was completely destroyed and eating was painful. I was also told I would have to stop eating and only drink medicinal supplements for 6 months. During that time lunchtime with smosh was literally my comfort watch and got me excited for the day I could finally eat food again. Those were good times ironically
I love this
51:10 This is my favorite part of this video😂 I’d imagine Ian was pretty nervous about bringing up this idea, because it had been so long and he knew Anthony had not the best feelings about it, so to see his friend just jump up and be super excited about the idea must have been a pretty great feeling!
The day finally came
theese 2 are litreally a part of my childhood, god am so happyyy
It's heartwarming and sad at the same time, when I watched Smosh videos for many years back , I always thought that Smosh was the most subscribed channel on YouTube (this is before I heard about PewDiePie) and I knew Ian and Anthony were like brother's more than they were best friends and then when Anthony left, it was very sad; but to see these two back discussing their personal hardships and reconcile is heartwarming
I grew up on smosh, but I don't see it going the same way as it did back then. Anthony is a totally different person limited in mind. Ian seems to be same old.
This is what healthy masculinity looks like, being open about your feelings and not judging each others opinions. This isn’t just a reunion, this is a damn life lesson in the making.
Can definitely see there's still some drama, Anthony is a emotionally driven guy looking for self-improvemt and well being where Ian is business oriented. As bad as it is I kinda like that Ian for the fact he grinded it out and didn't go the therapy route
ahhhh i remember staying home from school in grade 6 one day because i had a cold, and i remember scrolling through so many Smosh videos on my tablet! just binging lol. now i'm 22 and this just, feels so surreal to me lol
I'll be honest. I stopped watching Smosh a long time ago as with this channel. I didn't particularly like some of the guests that came on. I know everyone deserves to share their experience and that is something I truly respect, but it wasn't particular to my interests. That's okay! Now, when I heard that Smosh was bought by Ian and Anthony, I had this wave of excitement that couldn't be explained. I felt this little part of my childhood become alive again and I still don't understand exactly what that means. On the other side, I am deeply concerned that such good friends were so sad when they were creating so many videos that made the world happy. You guys did some big things for the internet. You paved a way for so many content creators to make a living being their authentic selves doing what they love. Plus, seeing Ian's mom just made me smile. She's the best. I wish you both luck and I am going to resubscribe to Smosh to see what is in store for all of us.
Welcome home! ☺️🥹
I'm crying right now. This is wholesome
YES!!!
Main question ..... When the next FOOD BATTLE!!!!
Thank you guys ❤
Talking about easter eggs, will there be a return of boxman?
Man this has me tearing up. Smosh was my childhood. I remember having to sneak off to watch it because I wasn't allowed to as a kid. I'm so glad to see that these two will be doing videos together again.
This is my childhood.
the story of naruto and sasuke
I hope the skits are the same man. I remember watching you guys like years ago. I just want the same too dumb idiots to be doing just dumb things again.I'm so happy Like you guys were my childhood
WHO MISSED THESES PALS!!!
This makes me super happy! Glad you own Smosh again :D
All mid 20’s aged kids are be heal
Azaming information...
bring back opening fan mail that shit was my favorite
Proof that capitalism breaks friendships. You can blame capitalism for everything in your life. End to capitalism, just saying
This makes me emotional watching this!
The world is healing
this felt like a wet dream
smosh the movie was funny af idc how bad it was
The "Where's Anthony?" jokes were outright disgusting on the newer ""Smosh""
LOVE YOU GUYS
SHUT UP
mfw i actually liked the smosh movie lol
This is actually crazy and awesome that these 2 are back together!
Dang I used to watch smosh videos at my friend's house in the early youtube days. Such nostalgia edit: There's one video that stands out in my memory the most with a pink frosted donut so I went back to find it (Food Battle 2006) and omg the "SHUT UP" sent me through a wormhole to my childhood lol. I don't think the aspect ratio looked like that back then though lol. Those videos were *hilarious* to us.  It's pretty cool seeing them together now speaking with such maturity and openness, examining their relationship and inner emotional journey and stuff in a very adult way. I see my current self in that too
Fuck yea. I’m so stoked
Wow this brought a tear to my eye. Makes me reflect a lot on my past friendships and current ones. You guys are great dudes, it just took the time and pain to see that in yourselves. Long live smosh
Honestly either before or after around the time they sold I fell off of Amish personality it just didn’t feel like smosh. Happy to see them together again. You guys gonna bring back food battle?
The biggest tragedy out of all of this might have to be Anthonys choice to wear those shoes
Guys I'm so excited I literally feel like I'm 12 again I cannot wait for everything you guys are gonna do :)
Rhett and Link vibes! I can't wait for these two to get old and make a podcast together lol
Back when Anthony left Smosh I never thought about what he's gonna do now or what's gonna happen to the Smosh channel. What I really wanted to know was if he and Ian were still friends and they kept really quiet about that. So seeing this genuinely makes me happy.
I see you Ian with da chain
Two of the grandfathers of youtube back again
I really want to see the old Smosh teams reaction to the return of Anthony.
It’s not that deep LMAO
just leaving this for myself as a bookmark. (38:30)
the timeline is healing
Shoutout to Rhett & Link for being the best ❤
I laughed so hard when I heard the word cyberspace celebrities
You could make a whole documentary on smosh.
They can lead a modern revolution. If they push for what they believe in, in the power they are in, it will motivate what was so vauable when smosh was created, to what is lost in this current generation that is now dominated by larger corporations and companies.
It is really heartwarming to hear all of this ❤
every time i mention the milk fic people get mad at me
I'm 20 and I grew up on their videos
speechless, the kings of youtube have returned.
Now all we need is Richard Gale relese the spoon killer finally and youtube will be complete
Music just loud enough to think the person in the car next to me has their phone alarm going off
This was surprisingly cathartic. It gave me insights and perspective on my relationships with my best friends, friendships we formed when we were kids. Good luck guys!
Y’all talking about these lip sync videos is taking me back to 7th grade 😂 shit
After watching this fully, it feels very much like Anthony is so willing to accept Ian and wants to be closer with who he thought was his friend, but all Ian sees is money and opportunities to make money. Ian gives major; “I’m a heartless white money and power hungry shareholder” vibes. He sounds more like Tim Cook when he’s talking and less like the kid who tore ass all over a kids playground to film “Sex Ed Rocks”. I get that Ians biggest fear was failure but he should’ve unpacked why his fear of what he considered to be failing was so strong instead of blaming Anthony for the channel falling apart in the first place. Ian aligned very clearly with the authoritarian structure of that weird parent company because he equated money and relevance with success and began to see Anthony as a cash grab instead of a human being, and is making it clear throughout this entire video that he resented Anthony for not wanting to continue to be that for him. I think Anthony is still a little blinded by what should’ve been and what could’ve been because I think Anthony craves close and long lasting connections that have probably been few and far between in his life. Maybe I’m reading way too deeply into it, but Anthony know you worth, and Ian please be human, and please be genuine and unpack why you can’t let people in deeper than the surface. Acknowledge when things aren’t going well head-on. It’s the best way to handle things. Smosh represents friendship to Ant and business to Ian and when that comes to a head, it will get ugly if lines aren’t defined now.
This is not an interview.  This is two bros having a heart-to-heart talk and it felt different than the other ISAW episodes, anthony is talking more of their past and friendship and it is soo wholesome they were exchanging deep stories. I'm glad to see this duo is in the same video again.
to anybuddy studying Body Language: this video is a treasure
I really hope that SMOSH will continue to work out for you, both of you. Have been watching you guys from the beginning, it feels like, and I kinda lost some interest when a lot of stuff changed. I didnt stop watching entirely, but it wasnt top priority to watch. But with your two united again, I feel like I want to return watching again. No pressure, it's just the fact that you two ARE smosh in my opinion. Good luck and most importantly HAVE FUN!
It’s amazing that everyone collectively still wants smosh just as much as i do even when they have surpassed or become big themselves. I wish for the old content especially food battle ❤️
kudos to ian for keeping with smosh throughout everything. through every era of the channel he has stuck with it and kept it afloat. big big respect
I really loved hearing Ian be honest about feeling resentment for Anthony needing to step away while recognizing that it was the best move for Anthony. And Anthony letting Ian have the space to explore those emotions without getting defensive. I relate to them both, the need to be alone to heal and also wanting to be the optimistic friend. Y’all clearly have a lot of respect for each other and it was cool seeing you guys reconnect, and also just seeing two men have an open and honest talk with their friend.
I hope to god they bring back summer and winter games
It’s come a long way smosh
The Pokémon lip sync video is the first video I remember watching on YouTube. Kinda crazy to see how long ago it was. Makes me really happy to see you guys again
I'd love to see you spend a day with Alex Wassabi & Guava juice
Defy was a straight scam operation.
Definitely excited to see what you two create! I've not watched Smosh for that long but definitely exciting.
Im 35 now and I was in college when YouTube began. To see this come full circle is absolutely fucking insane and amazing.
1:01:14 "Comfort channel" is a perfect description.
you wouldn't have learned all of this if you didn't go thro all this!!
So its a blessing that Rhett and Link was the current owners. I think anyone else would have gave yall a tough time
I started watching when I was 9 - Smosh taught me how to swear ☺️
This is so heart warming.
Been here since Mortal Kombat lets keep it going ❤❤❤
oh slay
Im glad that internet is healing day by day
20 years old turning 21. Smosh we’re the friends I never had in school. Or should I say prison. Only 12 minutes in the video and these 2 still have beautiful chemistry. I rlly miss Smosh. Especially smosh gaming. I started phasing out of it when smosh babies was ending, amazing times that I’ll tell ppl for the rest of my life. Ppl look at me so confused when I bring them up. The classic shut up!! Mannnn. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ always love you guys. You live & learn.
I legitimately can't do or say certain things without thinking about Smosh; I can't say Charlie without thinking of that drunk guinea pig, I can't see certain foods without thinking of the food tests and battles, I can't play Assassins Creed 3 without thinking of shooting mofos in the throat with a bow, I can't see any Pokémon game without thinking of the IRL series. Everything you did left a huge impact on me. It's unbelievable to see you two together again and im very happy you're both friendos again
Love you smosh and Ian please work on your tick of saying "like"
I’ve been watching since I was 12 and I’m 20 now
Smosh made me discover youtube and english too. I wasn t watching them after Anthony's haircut. But i still felt like a part of this show. Thanks for what you done
Food Battle 2023?
padillas haircut looks shit
when did ian get glasses?
moral of the story, get sum fkin brunch
Ian's awkward laugh is so much more frequent now. I'm happy for the you guys that you own smosh back
I'm from Poland and I discovered SMOSH in like 2010 or something. I didn't really understand English very well back then, but your sketches inspired me to learn it so I could understand jokes better. I'm really glad you're coming back to that, hope it'll turn out well. Take care, both of you guys! ❤
I remember getting the notification that Anthony was leaving Smosh when I was playing basketball lol  I stopped playing to watch the video and shed a couple tears ngl  Good to see y’all talking and stuff, makes me nostalgic
I love how they used to look so much alike then time changed them
Watching this video made me feel as if two friends were reminiscent of the good times. It's a great feeling and amazing to see these two together again. Stay healthy and happy you two, we will love you no matter what.
I think Ian is pure comedy, glad to see him join forces again with Anthony.
These guys are just something else, they are freaking 35 now and are pioneers in this space, first guys to earn cash and sell a youtube channel. Not that latest content creators are bad but it is simply not the same as being some of the first.
im just happy seeing you two back together, smosh doesnt have to be something stressful for you guys, id rather see you guys happy and creating content you guys enjoy, tho i hope to see lunchtime with smosh as growing up it felt like i had friends to eat with whenever i was alone :) <3
God lord. The flashbacks really show how much Ian has aged like fine wine!
YouTube owns Smosh been YouTube period
I'm glad they fixed it but earlier? this was a members exclusive
Ian is such a great friend! He understood Anthony's problems with smosh and his need to disconnect. And now they're back!
“Existing is exhausting” haha my word such coddled behavior.  My mother would have kicked me out the house if she heard that nonsense being uttered 😅
At the end you should've pressed the "That Was Easy" button :*
Favorite episode of the show! This conversation was very cathartic and made me cry...I need to reach out to my lifelong best friend now. Congrats guys!
Thanks a lot 😠Now I wanna express my feeling as well
The kings have returned.
Good luck on your New ventures together again anthony.     What will happen to the i spent with series?
So happy watching this whole thing man 🥲 you guys are my such a huge part of the start of my teenage years with power rangers theme tune being the first yt video I ever saw then just all of the videos that came after. So happy to see you both working together again! Can’t wait to enjoy whatever you’re going to create next!
I always felt like something was off with Ian after Anthony left, now that makes a lot of sense, it's great to hear things are getting better :)
congratulations to buying smosh🎉 you should make an spent a day with Matt Rife i would be so funny🔥
U guys really tought me alot thanks for it all
Hype!
NO FUCKING WAAAAYYYYY💜💜💜💜💜
I remember watching the pokemon in real life series for days on end
ok this is crazy
Im so fucking happy rn
The gang is back together, reliving past memories!
this is a weird sketch
This interview was so wholesome. :D  Congrats guys.
i am so happy for you guys, wish you the best.
Ian Hiscock
All I remember about Smosh is, " SHUT UP! "
So happy you guys are together & own Smosh again!
Do a podcast guys
I love that Anthony still wears shoes from 2010
All young adults should watch this, your old friends aren’t gone forever we are just growing up 😊
I went to look at when Smosh was made it was made 19 of November 2005….I was born 11 November 2005 holy cow I feel old 😂😂
So hAppy for them I can’t wait to see what more mature smosh does I will be here for the full 4 years 🎉😢
Okay now spend your next day with the Teleporting Fat Guy
Watching this, Now I fully understand why Ryan stopped making videos too. Sketch Comedy is too much of a risk to make when you can only gain a couple thousand dollars at most and that’s without the expenses.
This is a really weird therapy session that I feel like I shouldn't be involved in...
Food battle 2023 plizz ?
I am so HAPPY to see you guys together again YOU FREAKING BOUGHT SMOSH BACK it’s just beautiful❤ you guys made my day everyday after school to watch one of your videos my god brother got me hip to y’all so thank you for being apart of my childhood and for COMING BACK AS SMOSHHHHH BIATCH❤❤🎉❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Mario RPG amd Smosh on the same week?!! Pinch me i must be dreaming!!!
Smosh started the year I was born I’m 18 now ain’t that something, so glad y’all are back
I'm going to rewatch the smosh now after this.
Ian kinda sounds like a douche
I first started watching Smosh in 2012 I believe, it was amazing, and loved watching every single video back then. I'm gonna love feeling like a kid again
FOOD BATTLE 2023
Welp, i grew up with yall from 2012 when i was 6 to now. im happy we all grew apart but slowly came back together so thank yall im almost 20, im out of school and growing with yall felt like family'
Thanks for sharing such a deep conversation between two people who can show that being vulnerable together is healthy. It's amazing how many little things relate to completely different yet very similar parts of my life and others lives I'm sure.
Realization kicked in that I am almost 30 and I watched Smosh way back when it was just started to go viral before viral was a thing and damn this interview really hit me in the feels. Just happy to see you guys getting back together as friends!
They're Finally Back😭😭😭
FOOD BATTLE 2023!
good for you guys and all, but WHY DID WE NEED TO BRING UP THE MILK FIC??? ptsd ngl
When Ghetto Smosh collab?
Head exploder game was actually fire
All I need now is a pink frosted sprinkle donut…
"if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do it with you." 😭😭😭😭😭  I know that as long as you two do this, and you do it together, and are in full ownership of this, then no matter what you guys do, it will succeed!
I know Ian probably doesn’t care but the cactus Jack air maxs would’ve went crazy with his outfit
The power of friendship wins again!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
“And if we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do that with you” my parents are back together y’all 😭😭😭😭😭
I remember coming home from middle school in 2011 and being so excited to see a new video from these guys every week. So glad to see them back together again!
🥹🥹🥹🥹
I literally cried with this video 😭😭😭😭 I can’t believe my parents are back together ❤ when you guys broke up my heart broke and when Jesse and Jenna broke up that broke my heart too and then Jenna marbles left too but now you guys have made me believe in love and friendship again and I’m so happy. This is literally my childhood and I love you guys so much I’m so so happy
I still spin back that AC3 song
Seriously this is amazing.. I will always watch them both. But someone get a “like” counter on poor Ian…
im legit crying listening to them talk abt their friendship and the difficulties they faced. im so so so so glad that theyve had a chance to repair that relationship and im so excited for their future
Can't wait for food battle 2023 and Pokémon part 900? XD
Can we get a mealtime with smosh again?🥺🤩
The 'let's burn this to the ground part' is so good. Like no expectations, just wanting to genuinely spend time with each other and make content together again. Having the process of making that be the win instead of the result. I cry.
super stoked, wishing yall and the crew all the best!
Yay!!!! My child hood has coke full circle. I am so excited about this !!!
Oh look! My childhood has reunited, wait as I’m writing this I just heard y’all bought smosh back!!!!!!
It's good to see the boys back together.
this was so good
A small part of my core comes from smosh. I resonate with there humor. They tell stupidly absurd jokes and do stupid things and I'm all here for it. We're all childish who resonate with Ian and Anthony.   Also shout out to ISMFOF. "Sex Ed rocks" freaking rocks.
9:28 😂😂
When Food battle 2023?
this one hour video felt really short this is amazing
the very first thought i had when the news that they got together came up was "is epic food battle gonna come back?"
❤️🔥❤️🔥🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😄😄
5:44 😂😂
1:24 cyberspace celebrities 😂💀
Holy shit! Leave it to the OG’s to bring genuine YouTube content back to the platform. So awesome!
Do you think that Rhett and Link sold Smosh back to make room and inquire the try guys 👀
Ain’t nothing like a good long lasting friendship.
Am I the only one who's hoping they sit down with the guys from I Set My Friends On Fire and talk about sex ed 😂
I think you spent more than a day with him, Anthony.
i feel like rhett and link are like ian and anthony's dads
I can't get over Anthony giggling like a schoolgirl, when they retold the moment they talked about buying Smosh 😂  It's so good to have you guys back together again! I feel like a kid who was just told their parents got together again after years of being divorced.
I am so happy for you guys! You got to reconnect, you're bring back your old passion, and I respect that you're not gonna just rehash your old stuff! I wish you the best of luck!  PS: I like that you want to make new stuff, but I will be disappointed if we don't see at least one food battle down the line
God its nice to see you guys back together like this
Ian needs his channel back as well
MAKE A PODCAST
I was one year old when Smosh began!!
i have waited rof this episode for a while
0:35 classic smosh :')
i think my childhood is coming back
The good news i didn't know i needed. Actually a bit emotional about this Edit: i also identify with Anthony's personal development. I finally learned to recognize emotions and it has changed everything
I think I put of watching this for a minute, but once I did, I am so happy and so proud of you both. Emotions are hard yall, and you both are amazing examples, at least for me, as you always were. Thank you 🥰
this really reorganized my idea of what the channel actually was. i really always thought they were besties and were having a good time. just hearing them say words like “company” and “business” makes me see it an entire different way. as an adult now i just never reevaluated my  childhood understanding of the content i was seeing. and i think that line really reflects both what anthony and ian are going through and how their audience grew with them
1:12 Got spooked because I'm currently sitting at the exact same style and make of the desk in this video clip
Cant wait  for the return of Food Battle , and lunch time with smosh :)
Ian and Anthony: we don’t want to make it nostalgic and repeat old ideas. Everyone on the comments: FOOD WARS 2023!!!
Smosh and Roosterteeth were a big part of my childhood obsession with YouTube man. I remembering myself in 6th or 7th grade watching them and now I’ve graduated college. I cant wait to see the content again
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Anthony's laugh at 51:45 is so genuine. You can tell he's so happy to be back with his bestfriend. Happy for you guys, I grew up with you.
Are they (Ian Hecox & Anthony Padilla) can be BFFs again?
WE NEED AN UPDATE ON STEVEY, PETER PETER AND TELEPORTING FAT GUY
The kings are back again. ALL HAIL
OMFG. I am actually seeing the rebirth of an Internet Titan.  Holy shit...
Yeeeeeeah Anthony Padildo and Ian Hecocks are baaaaaaackk!!!!!
Please do start lunchtime with smosh
I'm so glad smosh is back BUT, I hope anthony still makes these types of video at least every once in a while because of the fact that he's raising awareness for topics like these. Anthony is an amazing human being for everything he has done for us people.
I wonder if Max and Joji have a story like this
Alternative title: "I spent the day with my boy"
return of the king ???
I can’t be the only one to be crying to be able see these two legends back together ?!!!! 🥺🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Pretty insane that smosh is back
Ironically, they could actually make a good movie out of Smosh now.
HARDCORE MAX
Seeing them joking around and being so them together here makes me tear up
smosh the movie was goated i watched it 3 times
Nostalgia just ❤
when wassabi boys and smosh broke up my childhood memories were gone.. and now.. both are back again.. what a life to live in.
I'm really glad to be able to sub to smosh again, missed you guys
Man just seeing these two hanging out with each other like this is surreal. I'm really happy to see these two start Smosh together again!
The movie was kinda good though, wanna re-watch it but I can't find a dvd copy anywhere and it's not on any streaming service
Ive never smiled more in my life!!! 😁😁😁
Bro idk if he did this bc of me or not prolly not but I swear on everything I commented on one of his vids like a month ago or so and I said “ you should spend a day with Ian hecox🤷🏻‍♂️” I wonder if he did bc of me prolly not but if did that would be amazing oml😭😭
Not the infamous milk fanfic. 😂
so happy after so long they can still become friends
Bro w Teacher for pairing Anthony and Ian with each other
anthony do not take betterhelp’s moneyyy
The perfect reunion dose exist.
if you guys re-open shut up cartoons, please bring back oishi highschool battle, that series was in development of a sequel series but was cancelled, please bring that back
the old fan mail opening vids 🥲
I can't believe it, omg!!! Such a great news, you guys  I love you so so much ❤️❤️❤️
Proof that self growth is important! Love to see it
im gonna cry
I have one thing to say, FOOD BATTLE
Love you guys! My bestfriend in 6th grade and I were your biggest fans back in 2006. So excited to see what you guys are going to create this time around.
Whatever you guys do, whatever kind of content you want to make, the entire internet is here to back you ❤
This is great. Absolutely brilliant ❤️
Everyone approves of this ❤️
Ian is a real g
SMOSH is my childhood, I loved the og smoshgames peeps too
It doesn't sound like everything is fixed. But it sounds like theyre healing. And willing to fix these problems together. As well as remembering why they were friends in the first place. Smosh channel or not, this makes me incredibly happy in the depths of my soul. Humans healing and trying to understand
mi infancia <3
Some of my core memories and monumental moments in my life pair with old smosh/mail time with/lunch time with smosh videos. It’s hitting me hard seeing you guys back together again
What a happy reunion
Rhett & Link knew exactly what they were doing.   They kept a friendship safe until it was needed again.  They know what it means and wouldn't let them throw it away.
make another movie please
Food battle 2023 where all the people are zombies.
54:35 The most important part !!
Alright guys, this is how our parents getting back together!
Finally! 😭♥️
🥹🥲
This feels… weird, scary lol
i hate these videos they are so trash
Previously I though Eugenia Cooney said the most 'likes' per sentence ... but I think Ian is the new world record holder.  My god that was difficult to listen to. Flame on.
Ay first Wasabi productions returns now SMOSH let’s go
This is so cool to see the story behind the scenes. Ian is about the money and Anthony wanted to grow as a person and find himself.
i remember when smosh was the first channel to hit 10 million subs. (if i’m remembering correctly, at least one of the first couple channels)
so we're finishing food battle
Please do a food review show and do FIRST BIIIIIITTTEEE cause that is a sound bit of my teenhood that I NEED to hear again now I'm almost 30!!!!
Like you guys said, you’ve grown into different people than when all the original videos hit. How are you not just buying this for nostalgia purposes? How will you not still just be collectively doing what Ian did before — finding your modern relevance?
This is so shocking, Smosh is literally my early childhood and I’m so glad you guys are back!!!!
This was so vulnerable and powerful. Thank you for sharing. I'm so happy you two reconnected and healed your friendship. The internet has been so hard on both of you. I appreciate you two discussing the impact and the journey.
They have 3 videos on 3 diffrent channels on trending amd then bought back something that made youtube
Great to see two friends reunite
How can Smosh ever be Smosh again though … really?
I knew this day would come
In some ways it felt like finding my childhood again. Congrats
Watch them go on to come up with if movies were real 10 just for the laughs
Anyone know what outfit Ians wearing? Looking to buy myself
Nature is healing
been waitin for this
Hope you´ll Hire Patrick again to El smosh Spanish pleaseee im glad you both are together again, i growed up with you guys mostly with the Food Battles, those were my Favorites, Lov u guys, i cant wait to see you on camera again making sketches
Yall mind if I cry? :'v
The first thought I had when I saw the first close up on Ian with that outfit was "He looks like a South Park persian" that shirt with a gold chain
Its great that you guys are back
They didn’t even need to get back together. I was just stoked for this interview but now I’m ecstatic for Smosh 2.0
You can tell these guys are naturally funny.
The fact that best friends helped best friends have an opportunity to  be together again is the goat (Rhett and Link;Anthony and Ian)
I NEED AN OG FOOD BATTLE JUST ONE MORE THE FANILE. When it stopped i got legitimately sad.
9:23 yes. I was 8yo when I started watching smosh. My mom hated it Bc I was “too young” for the humor. But now I’m an adult and I can laugh twice as hard at the jokes😂 I love you guys, keep up the work!
You guys deserve this happiness!
Charlie works be very happy to hear this
*Nostalgia has entered the chat* ❤❤❤
I really appreciate the healthy discourse they’re having. Nothing wrong with addressing issues from the past and working through them; positive or not.
I never watched smosh before, but I'm tearing up. Seeing your guy's friendship be rebuilt stronger than ever after having to separate for your own mental health, and now you can work together again owning the company that made you happy and establish your friendship in the first place...  God, I am just so happy for you.
The internet is rejoicing
wtf this isn’t ghetto smosh
I'm glad you both FINALLY talked it out.
I'm so happy how Rhett and Link are so supportive with Anthony coming back home to Smosh. They never thought of the business part AT ALL! They were just really ecstatic he's coming back. I'm so grateful for Mythical for helping SMOSH for this period of time. You, guys, are the greatest!
“11 gang
Spent a day with Rhett and link please. Ty
I never thought I’d see the day to see Smosh together again. 😭❤️
So excited for this❤❤❤
It is SO refreshing to see this realness. Yes SMOSH is a business but these two are real human being with complex emotions. And who knows where you and the amazing people behind the cameras can go from here but one thing we need to collectively remember as viewers is that humans are not robots but that is what makes us great. Whatever happens for you guys, you have more than proven that you will learn and grow from it.
I remember watching their videos when they would go out to lunch together and I thought they were BFF's!
I will not take this smosh the movie slander it was the perfect pile of shit just like the cat in the hat
I saw Ian pop up every now and then in the Smosh videos with all the new people. Until a couple of months ago I had no idea that he was one of the two original Smosh guys because I just didn't recognize him with the new hair style and glasses and never connected his name 💀 Good to see them together like this. They've come a long way!
While I'm older and totally not part of a regular Smosh viewing demographic, I'm happy you guys got the original channel back together and it's all come full circle.  Hopefully you're gonna keep enjoying it going forward.
I first started watching you both in the very early days of your videos from the very beginning even before your sketches. The first YouTube video I ever saw was your original Pokemon theme song video, while the original upload from your channel has long since gone, my memories and nostalgia with your content will never fade. I remember me and my sister sitting down at our old Windows XP computer watching all your videos. "Anotony's new car" was my favourite and my sisters favourite was "cat soup". It even inspired me to eventually make my own YouTube content while nothing I made took off at all I remember the fun memories of being inspired by you both and enjoying making silly content with my sister. I kept watching you consistently for awhile even after my sister stopped watching I kept going then unfortunately it reached the point where the other actors came in (no hate towards them of course) and Anotony left, it just didn't feel the same anymore after that. A few years went by and for some random reason I felt a very nostalgic moment where I went back and watched the old Fred videos then of course I went back to watch your old videos and honestly I teared up watching them because I still loved them so much and a the wonderful memories they brought me, it helped me get through an incredibly tough night.  I just want to thank you both for everything. ❤ As soon as I saw the announcement that you both brought Smosh that wonderful gush of nostalgia rushed through again. I am so excited for what's to come. I have missed this so much.
50:55  1:11:37
Smosh has been a massive influence on my life and my personality. When you talked about how you didn't mean for Smosh to be directed twords kids, I completely agree. But it made me the man I am today, and I rejoice that I have the same since of humor that you both have. LONG LIVE SMOSH! Your names will be intertwinded together forever  PS. I love the Smosh movie (cult classic)
Anthony leaving Smosh was a cannon event
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
I am SO happy to see you back with Smosh!
I wish I was at the defy rager lmao
Hearing them be so vulnerable and truthful. I'm scared of them being partners again. I can't wait to see they're content again but when Ian said "our friendship will always unfortunately be intertwined with business" it made my heart ache a little. They're not living together so that's a plus but I just hope they can be friends and partners again.
Smosh is about to become the most subscribed channel on YouTube again
Rhett and Link are absolutely amazing. Honestly I didn't even know they bought it, I just knew it was sold and wasn't ANYTHING like the old Smosh. I stopped watching after Dixon Cider... I'm so glad y'all are back 🥺
Hey did you hear that Ian and Anthony bought Smosh back? Shut up!
Glad to be alive to see this
Money laundering scheme
:)
Cant wait for this sketch!
so is food battle back or
Would we get a food wars this year 🥲
This episode was nice. It was really nice to see the two of you on camera again.
What an interesting relationship I resonated with so many point about your guys relationship with my relationship with my best friend. Miscommunication is the down fall of everything.
Teleporting fat guy
Is that really Ian? I dont see a bowl haircut!
I had a smile on my face the whole time. Thanks for bringing me on this journey ❤
2023 has been 2006 all over again. Smosh has been reunited, DaxFlame is active, thewinekone decided to start uploading again, and Boh3m3 has come around as well!
This made my 7 year old heart so happy. I saw smosh for the first time 15 years ago and now I'm 22 and this just made my entire year.
this makes me happy. i loved smosh growing up with these guys. when anthony left i never watched smosh again. good job guys
Much love! So happy you two are back together <3
I love your guys unscripted moments. Because it shows your true dynamic as a pair of entertainers of sketch comedy😊
Mmm sounds like another story of evil corporations
Anthony is there emotionally but Ian 80%
Fucking hell i am old
i'm not an owl! ...Boys....
Smosh is back!🎉
Ran into them when they had a Guinea pig
The world is healing
anthony is achieving true balance w serious and silly goofiness and i’m so excited
Man i want to see the smosh crew reaction to this announcement
This feels like the end of the Parent Trap <3 so excited for the future of Smosh!
cant wait for food wars 2023
Love this. Now get jenna marbles please 😢
Shoutout to Mykie. I started watching Smosh after her Boyfriend Reveal video. I love her for her channel and for introducing me to you guys.
Please do “I spent a day with Rhett and Link” next
Welcome back, Smosh! In case you didn't realize, it's 2023 now. Are we really assuming the gender of Ian's cock to be a "he"?
Please tell me it’s just them two now on smosh. No more cast members
now i want other smosh members on here and just hear from their side of the story and how they felt
If anthony and ian is a pokemon they would evolve to rhett and link
Smosh's ao3 tag 📈
THE MILK FIC OH GOD
How good to see these two boys back together!!
Anthony : "i'm gonna cry a little bit.. we never even expressed emotions to each other so this is great..!"  Ian : "I still won't."  Anthony : " Okay, great"   the amount of sassyness here, the "IAN" energy is always there and never change i love it 😅😂
the only interview i wanna see rn
i love the movie i buy it :) i was a big fan back in the days
I respect you guys a lot. How you both grow as people is incredible to me. Growth/change is not easy and you guys put effort into trying to shape who you are today. You are a very big inspiration to me in how i want to grow and be like as a person. I am grateful that you make videos. Thank you for all of your hard work, keep it up.
41:56 has me dead asf bro
i'm crying, this is so important to me. these guys are such a big part of who i am as a person today and i couldn't be more excited for what the future holds for smosh :')
Will there be another summer or winter games some time again soon???
time heals all wounds, good to see you two back again, I am an OG and already invested.
Thank you guys for being closer again
I think this is a fantastic example of egoism, recovery, vulnerability and how life changes over time and what a wild ride it can be. Its an honor to be able to witness the large scale and the early microcosms between you two from afar, I cant wait to see what the future brings.... Ian, I know there must be more hurt you still have to talk out with Anthony over time, and I hope you can. The love inbetween you two is truly the key 🗝️ and Anthony Im SO MF PROUD OF YOU DUDE. I think we struggle with very similar things and to see that vulnerability, honesty, humility and trust was really the way out no matter what is indeed life affirming. You guys are both really important vibrations in this universe. Much love from Milwaukee 🤘✨ Truly inspired shit. Would love to meet you guys one day
:D
This is a massive moment to me because I grew up with Smosh!!! And the fact that Anthony and Ian bought Smosh back means there’s a lot of excitement to come
Great vid
I became a member as soon as I watched the Smosh announcement video. That channel kept me going through the 2020 lockdown.
not to be parasocial but it is cool to see them reconcile that friendship. I’ve fallen out of friendships/moved away from people I shared something really beautiful with and those people you just really never forget. I think especially as you get older, you realize how rare a true, close friend is. I hope that they’re now in a more stabilized place in their own lives to be able to balance work and friendship.
Me who only watched some pokemon sketches at the time.. but yes this is very cute.
Now it’s time for The Return of Emo Anthony.
THEY’RE BACK
as a child of YouTube even though I wasn't someone who watched smosh i feel like we needed this especially with all the other ogs
I remember watching smash when I was in 6th grade and now I just graduated high school🥳🥳🥳🥳
I wish Charlie could see this reunion 🥲
Y’all should have a channel together, I like the chemistry
This is so tense
i have the same feelings now as when Alex Wassabi and Guava Juice got back together...
can't wait to see ITSAGUNDAM mald ever this.  be the second best day of my life.
Anthony Padildo is back!
1:11:37 my heart. Im dying
Who's Ian Hecox anyway? Actually... Who's Anthony Padilla for that matter? And could someone PLEASE tell me who the heck am I?!?  Seriously though, glad to see you both together again after so long. I certainly hope you both find what you are looking for with Smosh back in your hands. :)
SO FUCKING PUMPED
The old Smosh worked because it was two friends doing stupid sht they found funny... And we did too... As an old fan of Smosh, I'm glad you are back!
Anthony is the gun and Ian is the bullet
I remember being in my early teens and not understanding half the jokes, but it still felt funny cuz it was Ian and Anthony together.... if they are coming back for smosh together, I'd be really happy...
*As Ian and Anthony do their weird butt hug, they dance around and they both feel it… the pure bliss, as their faces move closer* that’s the fanfic they said not to write
i hope that you guys talked more off camera
Damn y’all. We really all grown up now ): this is so heArt warming in so many ways. My inner child is def smiling too
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
How many blood sacrifices do I need to do for you guys to make a few skits together again
It’s cool the Ghetto Smosh guys got back together
Who else remembers smosh “sex Ed rocks !”
This made me cry yall made my child hood much love to yall ❤❤❤❤😢
i need a comedy sketch for, "I spent a day with THE CHOSEN"
i thought that said “handcox” for a second
This is too cute omg❤
You should do collabs with joel haver or cherdleys
I remember watching yall for the first time back in 2012 in 8th grade, its so cool to see how far your journey has come for the both of you now as a 24yr old 😊 thank you
me waiting for food battle 2023
Grew up with smosh, this was amazing
rhett and link so cool
They forget to mention but they were offer Stocks while there was little to no internet back then. The best info you can get was from the library or an actual business professional.
What some people forget about is youtube was a new concept at the time. Now we have proven record of people making career out of it for multiple years, but back then? Nobody knew what was going to happen. And their were multiple case of people shooting in subscriptions due to one viral video and losing that momentum right after. So I see why Ian thought it was a good idea at the time.
Can’t even tell you how much I needed to listen to this conversation. Just yesterday I had to send a goodbye for now text to a friend and I feel guilty even though it was a good decision. I said in it as well this just isn’t our season and seeing living proof that seasons like that can end was what I needed. Happy to see you two together.
I’m laughing again So nostalgic I’m glad they were able to express themselves
the world is healing
I can only imagine the reactions of teen Ian and Anthony after hearing the wild mental rollercoaster their friendship was going to go on. Super happy both of them are back together again.
I'm not crying you're crying. SO happy for you guys! So excited!!
Thank you guys for sharing such a personal conversation. I’m so happy and excited for you both! 😊
I'm so happy you've both explained your frustrations about Anthony leaving Smosh.  Glad it ended on a positive note, like Ian was always thinking
not the milk in the bloopers... smosh is def back
Goosebumps. Tears.
Man im so happy seeing Lan and Padildo back together.
crying bc rhett and link took care of y’all so sweet
They look Happy
Smosh forever.
I was one person when watching the og smosh and now I’m a totally different person crazy they are too time is amazing
every blank ever was always a hit show, I still do not understand how it is watched
I am literally crying
So does this mean the Anthony Padilla will remain aswell or with this channel be abandoned
It seems like the guys will be making content that hopefully has aged with them but still retains the original smosh magic. Looking forward to it.
What a time to be alive. So happy to see this, I grew up watching you guys.
they remind me of drake and Josh
Part of my childhood on YT when it was starting was these guys. Ugh they were such a classic back in the day.
(In Chosen’s voice) So you’re finally back from fighting laser dolphins in Guam 😅😂
Anthony and Ian.  This was beautiful.
I might have to re sub to Smosh, I honestly unsubed back when Defy was still in charge because it honestly got to the point where it just stopped feeling like Smosh ... hell, I can't remember the last time I watched anything on the Smosh channels
lmao member shit, what a shock
Holy shit, this was so adorable. Also, totally made me smile when you mentioned "Tannenhauser", that opening line rings in my head every time I'm about to make a big decision.
I remember when you guys used to go get lunch
Good to see Chris Angel back with his friend.
Ian is Bored is forever one of the most goated series on youtube
Wonderful conversation. I wonder if Rhett and Link experienced this at any point or were able to offer guidance to you two. Also holy cow, y’all both had a glow up emotionally and physically, so proud 🥲
Did people really think "Anthony's nothing without Smosh"? I think I stopped watching when Anthony left.
Wholesome insights into your friendship and how the business affected it. It's a wonderful twist that you guys once again have ownership of Smosh after all these years~  Also, shout out to Rhett and Link being kind humans
Perfect friendship interview There was some love Some salt Explanations They both understood each other and now they're BACK TOGETHER
Smosh was the first video I ever saw on youtube in elementary school over 15 years ago. My friend showed it to me in “the computer room”. I remember asking her the name of the website “you-tube?” Wild.  The second video was a music video of “I will survive” with Jesus singing and at the end he got hit by a bus
Please bring back Charlie the drunk Guinea pig for the outro
Look at God I feel like I’m 15 again 🥲
It’s kind of nice seeing them have an honest and raw one to one conversation about how they felt and what happened. It provides a lot of transparency about what it was like, the good and the bad of the transition and what they both wanted and expected. They both have rose above all expectations.
I remember seeing a comment on smosh saying someday that will comeback together  and thinking yeah in another universe.😮 well now geuss dreams do come true
"yeah"
Food battle 2025? 😂🎉
Internet wasnt ready
Loved the openness about the rift that developed and how they needed time to come back together. I also appreciate that they were honest in saying they both doubted this would work, that the spark of their original friendship remained. It's a good reminder that sometimes friendships end, but also sometimes enough space/time/whatever factor can allow healing. I wish you guys the best.
10:25 I loved Smosh the movie
This is more like a Podcast than an Interview. But Im really happy that the Smosh Duo is back🥰
this is so awesome woooo
you have no idea how much i cried hearing the news! congrats to the both of you and i am excited to see what you guys make :))
I’ve been waiting for this for too long 😭
LOVE YOU TWO <3 EXCITED FOR WHAT'S TO COME
I’d love to see Ian and Anthony create a Ted talk on their experience as full time creators and what they learned as a result of the internet blowing up and how they monetized their content in different avenues. It’d be great resource for new creators.
This makes me so happy on so many levels and the whole interview was soul-healing. But I was NOT expecting the milk fanfic reference, oh god, not again.
Squat hug lol
no way he said rofling 🥺56:37
Guys, I can’t believe you haven’t thought of this, but find the shoebox with the sketch ideas in it!! Like, I picture it in the back of a dusty warehouse, a la Indiana Jones…guys, this is gonna be great. Maybe hit up Jenna Marbles, do an epic collab with her. Seriously, this is gonna be amazing!! Ok, I’m really excited. But this is just great. WOW. Just wow. ❤️
Smosh was my childhood. I remember running home from elementary school every Friday in 2011 to watch the next video. It was such an awesome and hilarious way to start the weekend.
The world is healing, Ian and Anthony own smash together again ❤
Now you guys can have other YouTubers in your Smosh videos :)
This brings me such second-hand joy. Is it weird that I want them to do a book club next?
Me depressed af and having a tired week: 😔 Smosh: Guess who’s back? Me: 😫🥳
SHUT UP intro when?
“Spending a day with Ian hecox” was just an everyday thing back in the day
This really healed my soul, i cried when anthony cried, ive been watching since i was 8 and now im 25. ❤
Not the reunion we thought we needed, but never thought we'd get.  Glad to see you guys back in action together! Here's to Smosh 2.0 (or 3.0? 4.0?? IDK)
I don't think you guys even realize how big this is! This is perfect timing too, I think smosh is about to get bigger and better than ever. So happy to see you two together again!
you guys were my childhood
my parents are back together
The beauty of the podcast is really seeing how both of them fill up each other’s “gaps” in their own philosophies
It seems like you have a genuine connection with this guy. Have you thought about starting a channel together?
I told myself I wouldn’t subscribe till you did this
you know, sometimes soulmates don’t have to be romantic. i think this is a beautiful example of how people can be meant for each other without being romantic. best platonic relationship
Omg the milk fanfic
Food battle 2023?
this is like the perfect ending to another book in the Smosh series. so happy for you guys
I wish we could've seen the reactions of everyone at Smosh of the news 😂
soooo hot take incoming. idk if i really like ian that much as a person. maybe its because of his emotional firewall that he always has but even at some points throughout this video i was like, "man, ian is kind of a douchebag" and ive never seen anthony as that kind of person. hes so humble and down to earth. like for example imagine if ian was doing the interview content that anthony has been doing. is he really capable of being such an emotionally understanding person? tbh i dont see it. i think anthony is just a better person im sorry. ian seems a little butthurt and incapable of truly being something other than an emotionless, almost arrogant person. if i was gonna sit down and chat with one of these dudes theres no fkin way i wouldnt choose anthony. sorry for whoever i just offended. but man this video is kinda sad for me. i feel like even anthony was a little surprised at how ian responded to what he was saying. i felt bad for anthony at multiple points in this video. idk man. maybe im just dumb.
just turned 17 and seeing this video just puts me in so much joy
RETURN OF THE KING(s)
We need a video called “food battle 2017 , 2018 , 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 the final battle”
My best friend and I watched Smosh throughout middle school and high school. Just like you just drifted apart, my friend and I drifted apart, but we still hold on to our friendship even if we are at different parts of our lives. You don't know how happy I am to see you together. Even though I stopped watching Smosh, I was and will always be an Anthony and Ian fan. 🥰
I love you guys. Congratulations and best of luck! I've been following Smosh since we were all discovering the internet together. It's been a journey I've followed you on and I hope for the best in this new chapter.
*Y  E  S!!!*  my favourite duo is back Man-child and Child-man :y  no but seriously, I'm really fuckin' excited c: (this video made me tear up a couple of times x'd)
All great conversation aside....the fanfics have me crying😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
I still remember finding out about you guys in the 3rd grade, so much time has passed since but here we are now! Congrats guys
You should interview Anthony Padilla
I like how in this episode it’s like Them having a conversation instead of Anthony just interviewing him
I started watching smosh after their first pokemon lipsink video (they had to reupload a slightly different version due to copyright i believe). Cant believe its been 17 years.  I cant tell you enough how overjoyed to have an OG youtube creator return. I feel like both of you and the generation (my generation), did so much growth and went on an amazing journey together. Im so happy to see this rekindling friendship and im glad youve both did some healing and rediscovery of yourselves.  It’ll be a joy to continue to grow into a more adult self. Im only 27 now, but still have so much more to grow myself. It means a lot to continuing growing with you and ian again as i once did when i was a kid/teen.
Smosh was the first channel I ever watched on Youtube. If I'm ever having an off day, I just rewatch their old skits and always get a laugh out of them. Seeing them in 2023 reuniting and starting their journey forward together again makes me excited beyond words :) So so thrilled to see this next chapter!
Its been a while, hasnt it?  Wait, your telling me that if the teacher had simply decided to pair you guys with someone else, smosh wouldnt exist, this video wouldnt exist. Thats actually crazy.
the fucking nostalgia bro. thank you for this
i fucking loved smosh! :)
rhett and link pulling through and once again showing us they are the dads of youtube
i will never forget when i sent in a drawing of a unicorn into their PO box and they showed it on mail time with smosh. it made my year when i was in middle school. 💖💖💖
This interview only proves that genuine/real friendships can and will prevail no matter the problem they face. I'm happy for you guys.
Full circle 😁
You too need to kiss
Two bros, siting in an interview! Five feet apart cause they’re good friends!
Rhett and link the goats
If we burn it to the ground I'm glad it's with you... Damn that one was good.
This is awesome 👍👍. But also hope Anthony keeps going with his channel. His interviews are so good.
Anthian is back!! Made my whole decade ❤
Aww this made my heart so full. You guys are so adult right now. Proud of you guys and your journey and being open about your experiences.
I just want lunch time with smosh back 😢
I’m so happy with these news but I hope Anthony doesn’t overwork himself trying to juggle both this channel and Smosh
Dude, my cousin and i used to watch these two back in early middle school to the day Anthony decided to leave. Back when Yugioh Abridged and DBZ Abridged were huge, this was the era we grew up with. Seeing you guys together again legitimately brought tears to my eyes. Like seeing old friends who you haven't seen in years.
The cringe is back yes rejoice.
Honestly, I loved Smosh the Movie! I am so incredibly happy about this! Smosh has meant so much to me. I've been watching since I was but a small child. I never thought this would happen and I honestly don't know how to put these feelings into words. Thank you and congratulations! I am so excited for you guys and for our community. I am ecstatic and eager for the new content and really happy that the younger generations will have the chance to experience Smosh as I did. It's been such a huge part of my life for so long and I honestly haven't felt quite right since Anthony left. I'm feeling so many things and they are all wonderful! I love this. I absolutely hate you for reminding me of the milk fic but I adore the both of you for everything else. Congratulations guys! <3
Does this mean we could get another food battle?
Jesus the Way to the Father 5 Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?” 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7 If you really know me, you will know, my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”(John 14:5-7)
serious question. is food wars coming back?
diatribe? ruminate? the most educated ceos
I’m so hyped to see the first video of smosh with you two together 🤩
With Ian and Anthony back together..is Stevie gonna make a grand return
What’s going to happen to Anthony’s independent content now that he’s back at smosh?
This sounds like a couple that broke up and after growing got back together
My friends older brother showed me Smosh in 2006. These are actual YouTube legends. Only AVGN can compare. Extremely based, pure soul, absolute kino, etc.
How dare you mention the Milk fanfic…. Now I’m traumatized 😰😭
Homie said "literally ROFLing" 😂😂
Wow Anthony and this guy Ian seem like they would make an awesome duo, they should make a youtube channel.
this doesn’t feel real
Anthony is still as cute as I thought he was when I was young
The biggest thing for smosh to work is them communicating clearly, with patience, love, understanding and vulnerability, they have to be careful of not falling into old patterns that doesn'r reflect them as the people they are now,  I don't want them to feel pressured by their past audience so they can do whatever thing they want to create now.
I started watching smosh right when food battles started....I just turned 24 today...I have subscribed to smosh for all those years and supported that channel through its ups and downs and supported Anthony when he left and found his own voice...and I promise you now, I will support the new, classic smosh that brought me so much happiness and gave me so many laughs....I am so happy to see how both of you grown individually and, now, together...I thank you both for always being a small part of my life, even if you never knew it...I am so excited to see what the future holds for smosh 💞💞  Also: best birthday present EVER!!!!!!
I was on the verge of crying throughout the whole video but was able to hold back until that last line of Ian ''even if we'll burn it to the ground.. I'm happy to burn it with you''  my eyes just bursted.. so happy for my childhood heroes to be back.
you guys were my childhood!! i’m 20 now, but seeing u guys together brings me to tears. thank you for not giving up on each other. gl to your endeavours in the near future!
These guys are legends
Sooooo food battle 2024? pls?
i love you both dearly
Frosted pink sprinkle donut
I’m kind of curious to see if there is anyone subscribed to this channel who doesn’t know anything about Ian (or Smosh for that matter)
Yea baby this is what we’ve been waiting for woooooooooooo❤❤❤❤❤❤
Man... things really have come full circle now. I'm so glad y'all were able to have this talk and reconnect and were willing to share it with the rest of us. Thank you Anthony and Ian.
SMOSH was my fav growing up and Nigahiga and pewdiepie and Fred when i was bored
just resubed to smosh after 5 plus years
I would LOVE to hear more about the office rager lmaoo.
AHHHHHHHHHHH! ❤❤❤❤
I STILL HAVE THE FIRST SMOSH MAGAZINE YOU GUYS RELEASED!!!😊
The founders of smosh is together again
I'm so excited!! Every aspect about this is so special ❤️
Return of Boxman?!
Me and my friends really grew up watching these two. They really molded our childhood humor and gave us great memories, love to see them together again🫶
As someone who has worked 90 hours a week and was doing 80 hours a week for four months in a row I couldn’t imagine doing 100 hours
I loved the movie!
what happened to stevie
I missed you so damn much
The fact that you bought smosh back is unreal. I hope you fired the trash that took over
I love how Anthony is letting his emotions go and talks about why he feels that way, and Ian talks like a dad and talks about his emotions but keeps his feelings separate. Overall this makes me happy and excited to this future of smosh, a nostalgic flower has grown in my heart.
Is there go to be another Pokemon in real life
i never watched smosh and hardly knew who anthony was before this show other than that he had a very successful channel i knew nothing about, HOWEVER! i have come to really like anthony through this series and this whole video made me emotional and i'm very excited to watch New Smosh! i think the thing that Big Business didnt understand and a lot of creators also lose sight of is that what we as viewers fall in love with and find comfort in is the People behind the content. it's the vulnerability and connection and you simply cannot mass produce that. you can push out as much content as you want but when it loses its authenticity it's not enjoyable for anyone. i'm so happy for you guys and thankful to rhett and link for stepping up and stepping down, i have so much respect for all of you.
When's the next food battle?
Smosh redemption arc
It seems like Anthony knows him
The boys are back in town
anthony's independent sketches were funny idk why yall dissin
This gotta be his next most viewed video in his channel
Need smosh x game grumps
So.. can we have RYAN HIGA and RHCP Team back again?
It’s like having your divorced parents get back together
I lot of young people today don’t remember the early days of YouTube. It really was uncharted territory; a whole phenomenon. Being a “content creator”/“YouTuber” was a completely new thing. There were no protections for creators. I remember watching Smosh in middle school, and honestly it’s really cool to see these two reunite not just for their fans but for themselves.
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Part of what made smosh so great to me as a kid was the fact tht u weren't making it for someone tht age but I was still Able to find humor in it. I could still see the jokes. & As I got older I'd look back at Smosh's page & ur stuff would b even funnier bc I FINALLY understood so many of the jokes. From video games to sex references. When Smosh had it's downfall with the parent company & then Anthony left, I really thought smosh could never recover without him. This almost  proves me right bc what made Smosh so good was u two, together. I don't think I've been this excited to see content from YouTube in a long time
This feels like YouTube's good ending
lunch time with smosh was my shiii
the difference with how people talk about ian and anthony in these comments. ian and anthony are smosh. these are real people with real feelings. this is their personalities and they’re putting their feelings in the table. it’s a privilege and an honour to be able to see this. y’all are so entitled and rude.
I'm in tears :')
hallelujah
im so happy for this bro the boys are back together
I just REALLY want to hear " FIRST BIIIITE" again. First channel I ever watched on YouTube. Awesome to see yall together again ❤
nature is healing
WHY DID THEY HAVE TO BRING UP MILK!? D:
Not related to this amazing episode, but my mind can't get out that Ian looks like a young version of Steve Jobs.
It feels so good to see Ian and Anthony back together, as friends of course. I grew up watching these guys and their skits and kept following them as they grew into Twitter questions, answering the giant pile of mail they couldn't get through, the barbershop pole, and the Game Bang crew. It was so much fun then and I cannot wait to see what they in store for future Smosh now that they own again. Congrats Ian and Anthony you guys are the top OGs of YouTube
I loved this and I honestly needed this!!! I can relate to so many of the things spoken throughout this video and it is so eye-opening and amazing how REAL this is----emotionally and mentally. I love you both and you guys mean a lot to me <3 Keep on being yourselves and exploring your creative identities.
They look and sound like a divorced couple reuniting after a few years
You guys were the first actual YouTubers I watched way back in the day lol. Before I found you guys I only watched movie clips lol.  You guys were so freaking funny and still are! It warms my heart seeing you guys together again and that you're running Smosh again! ❤️
agradezco estar viva
Protect Ian and Antonhy smiles at all costs!
not the milk fanfic
Brothers sitting down and talking  again.        This channel always bringing greatness!
Ians now the one that makes the negative remarks, like a bummer
Does this mean Mykie might be on TNTL someday?!
We’re gettin the band back together boys 🎉🎉🎉
I am a child who loved your sense of humor be proud 😂
i actually love the smosh movie lol. i think its hilarious
appreciate this deep conversation about true friendship between men. oftentimes in media you can't have a real discussion of two men's close relationship without people insisting it as gay, for better or worse (think frodo and sam in lord of the rings).
This is like if George Lucas bought starwars again thank God This finally happend .😂😅😅.
Much love and respect to Rhett & Link for not only selling Smosh back to Ian & Anthony, but also reuniting them.
do I spent a day with Rhett and link
growing up is realizing they were never really friends and thats okay
cant w8 for food battles
I love you guys!! Welcome back 🫶🏻❤️🫶🏻❤️
This therapy session is what we ALL needed before and after what happened to Smosh and questions that went unanswered - this cancels out everything ❤
this is so sad
My teacher worked for you guys
EXISTING IS EXHAUSTING
so sad yalls relationship is so public. itll never be a real friendship
I think this is truly a ground breaking moment in all of American history. I know this shit will be in text books. All the negative shit going down in the world and then something like this happens, it’s like a coming up for air moment after spending a few years at the bottom of a lake lmfao
😂 I miss the food battle and the music stuff
I couldn't click faster, but then I saved it for later because it's an hour long.
Im so glad we dont live in a universe in which ian didnt also left and now they are back together
OH MY GOD
These two making a science project in sixth grade was definitely a canon event
I was not ready for how much I'd cry, let alone how much(and I realize how this sounds) it was healing even for me??? Like I grew up with these guys way back almost when they started, and the separation was ALWAYS a big question mark. It was never my business and it would've been fine if this decision or video didn't happen but the amount of memories and paralels in friendship experiences.. and how genuinely Anthony cares about and appreciates his old best friend.. just reminds me of how much I miss my childhood best friend, and how life and moving countries separated us. Not to mention, coincidentally my childhood best friend is a lot like Ian in the fact that he doesn't show much emotion outwardly, so the dynamic hits my heart HARD. Inner kid me is overwhelmed with happiness/nostalgia
i dont watch this channel or whatever ian does but this feels historic
all smosh aside... anthony´s got that davey havok vibe going on
food battle 2023?
I just wanted to say I first watched you guys because I didn’t have any friends in school and in the process started learning English on YouTube watching you guys videos. Now I’m 31, living the dream in Canada and it’s all because of you guys. Thank you so much for being such a big part of my life.
I am actually so damn happy I’ve got tears! The collab, the reunion the healing of Smosh and the original boys back together again! I never thought I’d see the day! This is honestly the best thing ever to come out of Yotube! ❤️
👏 👏 👏
This is so nostalgic for me and I just have so many fond memories seeing new Smosh videos on the home page!
This really made me cry. Ive stopped talking as much to many important people from my past and it hurts me deep in my soul. But ive always had hope in the ebb and flow of a relationship, where they come and go. And sometime in the future, down the line, i could come in close contact and connect again with someone that was so important to me from before.
51:00 I swear I'm hearing genshin bgm in the back i haven't played that game in like 8 months why am i hearing it LMAO
11:38 even the slight effect just felt like old Smosh
As I cry with joy like everyone is saying I felt at 29 going thru it with life we needed Smosh together again the light that has been darkness! On the other hand I hope they take it more a friendship way than business way an hope don't burnout quick thinking they need to continuously put vids out. Love Smosh so much thank you Rhett an Link for bringing them back
The Rhett and Link stuff was so cute. Like they got such a tiny mention, because of how chill they were. They were the heroes of the story who saved Smosh, then were happy to let them run free as soon as they could. Not an ounce of drama to go over while everything else was about stressful events XD
Finally bois, we can get a "DiXon Cider" part 2 in the making!
"Somebody's gonna write a fanfic about that, and then we kiss afterwards" You heard em bois you know what you got to do🤣
S each others D
Does Anthony age…? You literally look the same just different hair
Please milk the reunion content! I am not joking! I am all for it!
When Ian said people were rioting and peeing on desk I have a feeling he was in the lead of it all 😂
I started watch smosh when there was the ''SHUT UP'' intro, My favorite had a scene with a cow thing I dont realy remember but I miss this old laugh
i'm so happy right now :3
Anthony is back. Had his Nick Jonas moment and it all worked out. Anthony has great content on his own and that is definitely something to be proud of. I wonder how his own channel will continue, because he has great success and i love his videos
the best lovestory ever
Please do a podcast x
Man, I was so jealous of both these guys when they first started blowing up on YouTube. I used to “hate watch” their videos just so I could find problems to hate on. I had a failed YouTube career and never committed to actually trying and uploading consistently (and their content was genuinely better). Glad to see them seeming happier, happy for their success now!
It’s crazy, is it fair to say that Rhett and Link are Ian and Anthony’s IRL foils. Two old school best friends making something that keeps us feeling safe, entertained, and not alone.
This is so beautiful 🥺
damn you guys are still being passive aggressive with each other
Did Ian always sound so cold?...   I don't fully understand what they're still bitter about.
The nostalgia high is real right now
What's up with Smosh the movie? I thought it was good. Yea it wasn't great. But I enjoyed watching it.
makes me so happy seeing two grown men have a HEALTHY conversation
Shout out to Diana for reuniting Smosh!! 🥰🥰
This was very sweet. I never fully watched Smosh as a kid but I remember seeing their videos come up. Truly rooting for you two.
Can we make one thing clear now, they are BOTH the hot and funny one
one of the original black and orange cat friendships.  in honesty its so nice to see these too talk (on camera) again and be honest with each other about feelings and smosh and all these other things.
Imagine for an April fool's joke Anthony says he's leaving Smosh again.  😅
Been waiting for this. I commented that it needed to happen as soon as I found this channel
where’s stevie
This is what harambe died for
I feel like this is one the very few good things that's happened so far since this year started. It's nostalgic, warm, it's a good change. It wasn't even expected to happen but it did and man it felt good to watch this happen :')
Please make some of those old sketches just for the nostalgia
<3
OG smosh viewer, I’m crying 😭 ❤
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town!
Smosh is legitimately back!!
This is about to make me cry
Bring back food battle and have different OG YouTubers participate in it.
Ian with the stache chain and animal print shirt and lotta orange, is giving me like 60s 70s seedy porn director vibes.
You’re telling me a good chunk of a generation’s upbringing was heavily affected by one random pairing in a 6th Grade bio project? Crazy
I’m glad the classic smosh is coming back.
I legit cried my heart is filled with so much joy
This video felt somehow personally healing to me. I think that speaks to the work you've both done to be able to be vulnerable with yourselves and with each other again. Thank you for this video :3
Smosh the movie was an AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!
BRING BACK FOOD BATTLE
They’re different people
Doc Oc's laser eyes still live rent free in my mind since the early days
this is the first video of anthony's that ian has experienced in full
Food Battle must return
But can we get smosh babies season 2
Damn I never expected this collab. It was great. I just wish Ian and Anthony could like, make a seperate channel where they do a bunch of random stuff.  It probably wouldn't blow up though to be honest
i missed them so much 😭
Smosh taught my high school self that periods suck and commas rule. I will be forever grateful.
When Smosh ended Food Battle, that’s when I knew it was over.
So happy for you guys! I just hope that now your friendship isn't used solely for business again.
YES… I LOVE YOU SMOSH😭❤️ i hope you use the same camera quality/film style as when it was you guys before hahah… memories are back:)
The bands back together! Now we just need Jenna and the world will be right again ❤
Oh god not the Milk Enema.. Im overjoyed smosh is back together but I dont need THAT part back.. 🥲
It’s crazy to think we could get a new food battle
There's an odd sarcasm to a little hate conflict in each other for having grown tired of each other as best friends...   They sound bitter. Particularly Ian with his tone.  I guess he does talk about it here.
IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR IAN AND ANTHONY:   Since it seems you don't already know, the milk fic is not about you. Someone must've treated the original like a copypasta and just switched out the original names for Ian and Anthony. It was written about Panic! at the Disco frontman and former guitarist, Brendon Urie and Ryan Ross. Hope this makes you guys feel better!
i’m so happy this is happening. i remember i was watching smosh jn 4th grade, and my parents got mad and took my kindle fire (no joke) away for YEARS. then i got it back and went straight back to smosh. it feels like a rebirth of my literal childhood :,)
I worked with Defy as a website owner, they were one of the companies that ran ads on our site. Leading up to their announcement of bankruptcy when they weren't paying websites (and owed me money) I went to their office in NYC and asked WTF was going on. They sent one of their lawyers out to talk to me and he told me they'd have an update for me the next day. Never heard from them again. I'm sure their execs got paid millions and when they owed millions did they step up and pay what they owed? Were there ever any consequences for them?
I still rewatch your Mortal Combat video 👍
The world is healing
We need an anime this journey.
BOXMAN FOR 2024 🇺🇸
😭😭😭😭
As the queen lizzo once said "its about damn time"
I started watching smosh at the age of 8 and seeing this makes me happy
The true OG's back together. I cant wait to see whats in store. But i know im in for the long haul. Ill be here when theyre the new Rhett and Link, living in their own nostalgia and making great content. I love these two. My childhood is back, now that im 24 and healing that inner child. This is the best news this year ❤
I think the videos could be good and alot of people will enjoy seeing smosh back but I fear that Youtube has not made sketch comedy financially viable nowadays. I seriously hope enough people support it through membership.
I am elated to see you both excited and at peace with how your friendship is and the future of Smosh. Love you both and all the content you create.
I don't remember when I was a fan, but 28 now, kinda cool that they're back together even though I've mostly outgrown comedy sketches and immature humor.    I'll at least try the next video, but I don't think I'll stay.  I unsubbed after they sold Smosh and separated, or a little after. Regardless, good for them.
I love smash so much I can’t believe this is happening I’m so excited for this new era! 🥹
I can't remember which video it was but I remember I was OBSESSED with them when it was just the two of them and then suddenly the camera quality got better and they had other actors in the video and I was like 'Holy cow, they're gonna make something of this'
You could cut the tension with a spoon
Dude my childhood!!!
i was 10 when i found u guys im 22 now i love smosh the movie i love every thing u guys have done i think its the og youtube
Ian was right these videos are too long
Been waiting for this!!!
Never thought Smosh would go back to the 2000s, my heart broke when i saw the channel change from what i loved as a kid. I am insanely happy with you guys joining back together and taking Smosh back to its roots, with Ian and Anthony as the writers, producers, actors and everything else❤
a canon event
All you guys are missing now is... who the hell is that? "WELL IM THE...... TELEPORTING TELEPORTING TELEPORTING FAT GUY"
Um... I'm honestly speechless  Not only is this just a highlight of what passion for creation does but just... you both being vulnerable about your relationship with each other, your growth that you've had to go through to find each other again, the honesty about reconnecting  This gives me faith in a lot of things: friendship, love, and passion to create to name a few.  Thank you for sharing
❤
Wow growing up watching these guys and seeing them have a genuine convo about their relationship is just amazing to see, the future of SMOSH really feels like the old YouTube days are coming back when videos were so fun to watch
Smosh is back!
Anthony is the Tom Delonge of Smosh.
Smosh, the movie should of been about them and how they met.
I remember these guys I used to watch them back in high school days with my girlfriend, seems so long ago
EVERYBODY THANK RHETT AND LINK!!
Ian will never watch this video 😂
Anthony you are a real role model man never forget that
idk why but my thoughts halfway through was remembering all the old stuff like lunchtime w/smosh and game bang and i was like “yoo are the shitty fanfics coming back?” and they even questioned it themselves 😂
Pretty excited for this, been watching Smosh since maybe before the first food battle in 2006 or 2007. Kind of stopped watched YouTube sketch channels in general especially after the whole ordeal with Defy Media, but might get back into it after this.
Man. I’m old.  I feel like the internet is healing. We ALL needed this. Thanks for everything guys ❤
modern day trey parker and matt stone
Anthony and ian like (-) and (+)
I want the new and fresh stuff but please food battles 2023
Every good fandom needs a MILK FIC
ah man the flashback sections hit me in the childhood region
Now we need RWJ, nigahiga and kassem G to come back
Anthony is a real one
Im glad to see that the King has returned 🫂
Lmao I felt the "Kids got on the internet and watched our videos" because I grew up watching it
FOOD BATTLES 2017 IS COMING!
We're so back
Omg!
why havent they started their own tv-show? like a latenight talk show. with some fun "smosh" games. it would be fun
PLS bring back foodbattle, what a series, me n my best mate grew up loving it on par with avengers
I can not wait for this!! so excited to see you two together again!!
This is so beautiful. I started watching both of you in junior high, back in 2008 and you were my favorite channel. It’s wonderful to see you both talking this out and being so honest about your experience. Much love to both of you! ♥️
The friendship between you two is so beautiful, and getting to watch you both evolve as human beings over the years has been really cool and inspiring as someone in the audience.
Anthony better use his old hair for a future smosh video 😂
new smosh podcast!! please!!
I remember watching the food war vids and the box man songs afterschool. Ahhh the nostalgia
my respect for rhett and link just constantly rises
As a long time viewer of Smosh, there is nothing more I could have ever wanted. I'm sure other fans also noticed the change in attitude from you both and I had always hoped that things would work out for not only the both of you separately, but as a duo that rekindled your relationship. It's good to know that you've both come so far as people and that's it's showing in the form of reviving something that at one point meant so much to the both of you. Keep up the good work guys 👍
Padilla/Hecox are the Lennon/McCartney of YouTube comedy fr
pig benius
Dude u 2 was my childhood , u guys , Fred and niga higa haha 😂
the teacher who paired you guys, knew it was a Canon event
Been waiting for this for years
In Anthony and Ian's hands is how Smosh thrivives. But hey I will see how much the quality goes up.
I'm so glad they're finally back together
I have new found respect for R(h)ett and Link. Real YouTube creators right there. ❤
I feel 14 again and I’m so happy. This makes me so so happy. Congratulations! You guys have fun!
my childhood self is crying with joy
We truly are living in dark but bright times. Glad to be able to be alive to witness something like this. To the past, the present and the future. And to Smosh giving us amazing childhoods AND NOW an amazing rest of our lives 🥂 🍻 !
🫠Waiting patiently for a high production remix of the Transformers Rap. Lol🧘🏾‍♀️
The boys are back 🙏🏻 grew up watching you guys and I’m so glad this is for real!
Smosh Babies
damn
This feels like a divorced couple re-connecting.
I never watched Smosh as a kid, or growing up, but even as an ‘outsider’, I can 100% say these two are Youtube legends, scratch that, Internet legends. Here’s a cheers to the future of Smosh 🥂
Now the real question, next food battle when??????????
Stop. Taking. Betterhelp's. Money.
Pokemon in real life
The fact that they used the old 2006 news interview to explain what Smosh is, was too perfect lmao
Okay next step is Anthony vs Ian creator clash to settle those pesky unresolved feelings once & for all, this must come down to fisticuffs its the only way
Please bring back lunchtime with smosh 7:55
I love how you see all of these verified channels with millions of subscribers geek out about these two getting back together, you can truly see how generations worth of channels all go back to smosh
Foooooood fight!!!!!!!!!!!
Smosh is gonna be EPIC now
Holy shit, I have been watching smosh since the Pokémon lip sync, I used to love watching you do food battles and when I got tweeted this I knew I had to watch
watching the video a second time cuz this is so surreal
41:47  Not the camera zooming in on Anthony's cry moment...
can we get at least one Lunchtime With Smosh please
WAIT WHAT
From a fan since the beginning, im crying with you guys. I’m so unbelievably proud and excited for all your channels. No questions asked im getting the membership!!
There’s something very profound about watching you two have this interaction after everything. So happy for both of you! It’s great being part of the community since you started Smosh!
I found the new company completely boring and nothing made me laugh. I watch the videos you two made and still laugh. The quality took a nose dive. You two are Smosh
Super Smosh Bros.
It is so weird that these two are friends.  Anthony comes off as such a douche bag and Ian comes off as just the cool "nerdy" guy that is friends with everyone.  Such an odd pairing.
It's quite beautiful when two people try to understand each other.
I remember watxhing the toilet one and ive missed the content u guys made alongside the gaming crew with the old cast and i miss the gta/horror game multiplayer sessions this makes me happy af
The fact Smosh is back together is insane to me. I've been watching you guys growing up in my early teens, and other popular channels back then (ime filthy frank, PewDiePie, etc). So the fact that this actually happening many years later after selling and then regaining the channel is huge ups. Can't wait to see what you two have in store for us.
bring back the classic shut uppp for the smosh videos please
epitome of it got views so u just kept going Until it got bad.
why did this like heal my old one direction wounds
I don't think people understand how unique this relationship is AND how amazing this reunion is.  Imagine you're best friend from high school that you grew away from. You know the one, we all have them. Instead of growing apart, you go into business together after high-school. You create something huge, you live together, you throw yourselves into this work. But... The magic of the friendship starts to burn out. You're more coworkers then you are friends. All their memories remain hit the friendship just isn't there. Eventually one of you leaves, and the company starts to falter. Instead, you both pick yourselves up and go in new directions. You are successful, but not together. Then somehow, someway the universe allows you to meet again AND reclaim that business and friendship.  Its genuinely amazing how this all worked out.
Ever since they bought smosh back they’ve been giving us the best content to have ever existed
The way I screamed
My literal childhood 🥹
These guys taught me all I need to know about sexual education. Thank you.
I feel like the kid of separated parents
Smosh the movie was funny asf to me and still is, and i wasnt even tht big of a fan of smosh, sometimes id find them too weird for and yet i still found myself rewatching the movie over and over again
I’m sorry for how negative the comments were while you were finding your voice. I had So much empathy hearing that
My childhood
OG SMOSH>
We need an Ian and Anthony Smosh podcast channel now
I was literally crying when they talked about how effortless it felt for them to fall back into acting and working together as if no time had passed 😭💖
im praying to see video games in real life again and Pokémon please, bring back my childhood haha. love seeing these two together
best i spent a day with ep by a mile
'if we burn it to the ground i am happy to do it with you"
My childhood…
I’m so excited oh my fucking what?!?!? I’m going shit nostalgia…
Can’t wait for food battle 2023
I’m excited for this. When the announcement first came. I literally screamed with joy.
i've started to watch smosh along with pewdiepie in 2012 when i didn't even speak english yet, and i watched it until anthony left, i'm so happy to see you guys together again <3
Nostalgia unlocked. THANK YOU🥹
I just signed up for a membership! Watched your content throughout my childhood/early YouTube days and was extremely saddened when I read of the breakup. You two being back together means so much to a lot of us that connected with your content when we were young and felt this "magic" you keep describing in your content. Carried that feeling into my adulthood, and I'm so happy we can support your journey and reunion now. Cheers!
Honestly the way they did that hug and made a joke out of it within the first minute comes across to me as a good sign It felt like an old smosh thing to do
Growing up with smosh makes this feel like looking at my parents having a discussion 😭😭
Im honestly so excited
Bro Smosh was my life when i was in my teenage years  My humor changed but the memories are  bittersweet
if this can happen maybe one day we will get some form of Jenna back :,)
Man, I'm so proud of them for their growth and their ability to communicate about these things when all the conflict and nuclear energy ran as deep as it did. Sometimes you gotta fall before you fly and look where they are now!!! I hope that buying smosh back is  a good step in the right direction and I'm excited to see what they do with their creative collaborative abilities. Sending love and hugs  it's like that song from Phineas and Ferb, "Dude, we're getting the band back together!"
Nice 😊
All early YouTube adopters are happy crying rn 🥲
Need some more Smosh and GGrumps
Then it burned to the ground...       Jk loves
I love them so much.
hugs should always be done with butts out
For this comeback to be perfect we need the old haircuts  to return
Finally, no more “wHeRe’S aNtHoNy?” Comments
Ghetto smosh better
Is it just me or does anyone else feel like Ian is giving off a weird vibe or like he thinks he’s better than Anthony ? Don’t get me wrong I’m extremely excited about this but idk if Ian is …
God 🙏🏽
1:11:40 "even if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you"  Reunited and it feels so good I never thought it would happen, but its amazing to see
We need a food battle 2023 😂😂
Can some one find the videos when Antony’s passionate start deteriorating so we can go rewatch
Welcome back you guys. Im so glad yall worked out everything and got it back how it was. just you two again. I swear if you guys are able to bring back Ray William Johnson and Tobuscus again. yall would have some magic to be honest. knowing you guys have each other back after all these years and time. not only shows your genuine friendship but also shows. You guys actually did it and came back  <3
These guys made my childhood funny. Thank you guys!
MAKE THIS VIDEO TO THE MOST VIRAL VIDEO ON THIS CHANNEL PLS
Idk I loved the smosh movie
I can't wait, I still get Box Man stuck in my head all the time xD
i'm not crying you're crying
This is perfect because I just came from the Bose summary! I didnt know who Anthony was until Ethan and booze talked about him but if its true, they seem like genuine people that got shit on by capitalism
I have never seen smosh and i grew up when ppl would watch =3. I love Anthony Padilla though
It's crazy that you say Youtube was so new at the time of the smosh movie. In my mind that is way past youtube's heyday.
1:11:32 killed me man 🥹
1:21 it’s weird thinking some ppl don’t know what Smosh was like.  Then again I was in third grade when I watched smosh a shit ton, and then yk, stopped watching. Until now ig lol
Fking YES!!!! I cant belive we are actualy getting you two back. Its like christmas came early this year. I wish much succes to both of you and your chanel finaly after heart breaking many years back to its roots. And even more you two finaly talking to each other again. You are childhood feiends you should have never been seperated after those years and thing you have done together
I enjoyed the smosh movie, i was young and was super hyped smosh had a movie to its name and loved it unconditionally for that fact
I'm sorry to hear that
whenever  Ian makes Anthony laugh it makes me so emotionally like seeing them happy is beautiful
NO FUCKING WAY
Truly the best timeline
Bro, im so excited to see what the reinvention of duo will be like. I remember watching these guys in the past and I'm glad that these guys will finally have fun again.❤
I grew up on you guys. I'm now a probationary firefighter/paramedic. Seeing y'all work together again and recovering your friendship is huge. I can't wait to see what you two do. Much love 💕
What a time to be alive
Massive W for Diana for making this happen! 😎
“YOU GUYS ARE FINALLY BACK TOGETHER, YAYYYYYY!!!!😝🕺🏻🎉🤣🔥🥳🎊” is what I’d like to say. 🙂either way I’m happy for you both. I’ve been a huge fan of Smosh since 2011 when I was in fourth grade and always have been ever since.
Honestly as a 30 year seeing them back feels weird. This is not just for us. It is two platonic soulmates coming back together. Ian seems like he has not process anything
i’m not crying you’re crying
My cheeks hurt from smiling all through from he nostalgia I’m getting right now. Wholesome❤
Fucking hell you guys really are just friends because of the videos huh
THE MILK FANFIC LMAOOOOO IM SCREAMING! God it feels so right for Ian and Anthony to be back at smosh TOGETHER! My middle school days were spent watching all their videos, smosh just didn’t feel right without them /both/. Congrats boys!
When we needed them most, they came back 😊😄
the way this is the length of a movie... PERIODT!!!!!!!!
im so glad you guys are friends again! when defy media started forcing smosh to create the garbage facebook humor "every blank ever" series i just gave up on it entirely.
first bite 🫔
Grew up watching Smosh, I’m a 21 year old man now and I’m in tears
Im so old
these guys seem hella chill together they should start a channel
I remember having Boxman in a class project when I was 8 in 2006. I also remember awaiting Food Battle vote-ins before a family Holiday... You guys are the best, carry on as friends. I will gently allow this to happen, holding back just how excited I really am. (Love it)
The little kid version of me is absolutely geeking out seeing these two back together. Will never forget growing up watching these two eat lunch
I'm literally so fuckin happy and proud of you guys!!!
The fact that y’all had lunch and didn’t make a lunchtime with smosh or do a first bite wills disappointment me for awhile but I’m glad to see y’all back
i was thinking new smosh movie, but think better told as a mini series, so we can see the whole story. AND everyoneplays themselves.
is it bad that when i first started this episode (context i use to watch smosh when i was a kid from like 2008-2014 or 15) i was like yooo anthony is interviewing ian from smosh! wheres the other guy? OH YEAHHH
two legends
I don't know if I'm the only one that watches them, but Viva La  Dirt League is the only other big sketch comedy channel, and they also have a fan funded style of doing things
I've never actually watched Smosh before I just liked these interviews, I don't know what the hell they were talking about.
My freaking heart ❤❤❤❤
Im literally so happy and i can wake up not wondering if you will ever meet ian again
Seeing people I grew up with and be good old friends talking is just so amazing to see🥹
Wow never thought I’d see the day the world would mend back together damn
They bought smosh… my childhood is healed.
I was what...11 or 12 when I first found Smosh? Quite literally the first video they ever put up. I am now just turned 29, and this was so profoundly beautiful. First channel I watched on Youtube, and now first membership I pay real adult money for.
I have never watched Smosh, but this, you buying it back, makes me so happy! ❤
Almost cried! Lol, I'm so freaking happy for you guys and for this! And so freaking excited! ❤ Congratulations!!! 😊 Seeing this honestly made me think a lot on about my self and being honest with me and how I feel ready to seek therapy. Like seeing you guys be honest with each other and yourselfs and the timing. I'm just so happy for this and for you guys!! Thank you.  *sends hugs*.. 🙃
Ian mentioning that kids shouldn’t watch it reminds me of how I was scared to be caught watching by my mum 😂
Love how half the comments in the announcement video was everybody asking Anthony to do this when this was probably already pre filmed ready for the fans, what a legend my childhood has been restored
This??? Is literally a love story??
They're still not on the same page. Anthony is excited to get back into Smosh with Ian.   Ian on the other hand is apprehensive. It feels like this decision to get back together with Anthony is more business related than it is, emotional.   They're relationship is just never gona be the same
Smosh the movie was a masterpiece, me and my brother watched it atleast 30 times
So proud of yall
I really hope this works out for them, and for us 😂❤
this just sounds like group therapy
still waiting for food battles. bring em back pls.
Anthony and this Ian guy have such good chemistry, they should make a YouTube channel together or something
So likeeee We getting the “SHUT UP” back!!? Also good battle 2023???
I was just staring at my food battle 2010 shirt the other day thinking at how I couldn’t fit into it anymore 😅😅
Their first video should be a "Smosh - Food Battle 2023"
why is anthony sum roblox edgelord now lol
I remember watching Smosh and sadly stop watching it because the content didn't feel... Special or unique.
Smosh the movie remake anybody
crack is whack
This feels surreal but this is what I've been waiting for, this & yes the OG smosh reunited as 1 babyyy 🔥🙏🏼🤙🏼
Havent seen Ian in a while. He looking really fcking good! Glad to see them both thriving :’)
58:00 - 59:00  Hey guys, so I was probably 11 or something when I found your videos, and YouTube in general. It was around about the same time my parents got divorced and while I didnt realise it at the time, your videos were providing me that escape and that ability to laugh and have fun.  I'm 26 now, and hearing you guys talk about working together again actually brought tears to my eyes. There are no words to describe how happy it makes me knowing your childhood friendship has repaired itself, and that you can laugh together again.  Everyone has relationships come and go in their life, but It's truly great to see this one blossoming again. I didn't realize how bad I needed this.   Thank you, to both of you, and congratulations.
It’s nice seeing them 2 sitting down and talk about each others lives after they split, revisiting old memories, bringing back the humor they still have together, and coming up with new ways to bring smosh back was really needed for them and all of the fans who grew up watching their content
That handshake at 1:11:53 is the begging of something big
Crazy how i was a literal kid with no worries in the world besides school when i was first watching these two guys. Now im seeing them over 14 years later and im an adult living on my own. Its kinda emotional to see these guys from my childhood just chill and be together again.
It feels like Anthony is fully expressing how he feels and Ian still has a a wall up to his feelings.
okay Everyone Knows who SMOSH is You guys are the best! was my childhood
I Still remember FIRETRUCK to this day!
I have no idea who either of you are, and I'm okay with that.
I never saw this episode of Ian is bored
This entire time, I had no idea this was Anthony from smosh. Biggest reveal of all time.
this is historic people are gonna put this in the history books right between covid and ww3
people don’t know how og these guys are so many channels from their peak era are dead or disappeared in relevancy
Your real relationship seems so similar to the one in the vids
Anthony: omg I'm so excited for this!! Ian: * cringe * well, it's not the worst idea.
The reunion we didn't deserve, but the one we needed.
Can we get a new lunchtime with Smosh vid please
Nobody talking about the milk fic down here
Damn, it's been 6 years!!!
And he got the therapy sponsor for the ian video
Now I feel like an idiot for unsubscribing to Smosh, thinking they would never come back. I'mma subscribe again hehe.
a truly historic and iconic moment
a truly historic and iconic moment
1:11:50 yea
1:10:30 aww
1:10:20 yes
I actually liked the movie.
1:09:50 yea
I just smiled for over an hour straight
these 2 are dripped tf out
bruz they talking like a couple *smooch smooch*
1:08:25 yea
1:05:40 yea
I hope this means we get the *SHUT UP* intro again.
1:04:25 yea
I broke up with my best friend for a while, some chapters of life need to be with or without people. I’m happy y’all’s paths crossed again 🔗
1:02:50 yea
i watched the SMOSH movie wayyyy too much at a kid😭😭❤️
0:59:59 yea
9:20 both trying hard not to say there childish
SMOSH IS BACK BABBBBY 👍👍😀
Its honestly amazing to see you guys back working together i never gave up on the idea of you both coming back and now its finally happened
So Ian has two traumatic memories involving milk
We need a "Mortal Kombat Theme" Remake Now !!!! BTW I'm so happy you are both back.
This feels more like a healing process then anything.
54:25 yea
Whaaaaaat
51:40 lol nice 😂
Box Man lives in my head rent free to this day
Oh no you didnt
Lmfao at making butthole jokes with kidnapping survivors. I feel like Ian held back a hard laugh there. That alone gave me hope for their sketches in a twisted way
What a smosh way of bringing back smosh
49:50 yea
I thought Ian was the better looking one, even with his iconic hair. He has such beautiful eyes. No homo ofc 😉
A day I never thought I would see again. My heart is flooded with emotions. Thank you so much for this.🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Best youtube friendship ever
I still feel like I’m dreaming after this news. The struggles it took for these two to finally reunite gives me hope for the future for so many things. History has been made here, and if these two icons can come together again anything is possible ❤
I’ve never watched a Smosh video and only know Anthony from flipping past him in shorts. Watched this whole video. This is some Real Grown Man Shit right here. Nothing but respect for these two. Keep flourishing
44:50 yea
This is the best thing ever 😮I JUST SH*t MY PANTS if yk yk
43:25 oh no
So is this channel now apart of Smosh?
i knew this would happen
the boys are back god bless
39:42 When grown men start talking about their feelings problems get solved!!! I am so happy this has happened.
Juan Hecox
Please tell me this means we're gonna see Food Battle return
39:10 nice
It's nice to see Ian and Anthony back as the iconic duo again. I'm looking forward to Anthony's dynamic with the rest of the Smosh cast too.
Loved this video and looking foreword to the future. 😎💜
Best timeline ever !
37:50 nice lol 😂
Seeing just how much they’re emotionally healing is inspiring. They’ve been through so many highs and lows, and even lost each other for a little bit there, but now that they’ve been through or started healing journeys you can see the reconnection! I wish these two nothing but success, they’ve been working so hard to make us laugh for almost 20 years! That’s insane!!
35:25 nice!
Really beautiful episode, makes me believe ill reconnect w my past  best friends.
34:40 nice
I remember watching the first videos from Smosh on old youtube! I thought they were really cool teens 😂❤🎉 honestly still love them to this day
ian is fantastic at articulating his thought
This is so cool!!
32:35 *CONGRATULATIONS!!!*
“A true friend is someone you can not talk to for a year and then hang out like nothing ever happened” although this is more than a year
Glad your back Anthony.  Happier u 2 could bury the hatchet and rekindle your friendship.  Tip don't let Courtney sensor your creativity.  Idea.  Smosh fall and spring games. Halloween Thanksgiving Easter st.patricks day. Etc. Hope yalls sketch comedy connects its what smosh has been missing for the past few years.
31:50 nice
smosh the movie is a cinematic masterpiece
Why does it seem like Anthony came back to Smosh to become close with Ian again and run what they made together, but Ian just invited him back for business purposes; just to get more views and gain the traction smosh once had?
30:25 that would be entertainment uhh
29:50 oh no
RELEASE FOOD BATTLE 2023🗣️🗣️🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✅✅✅💯💯💯💯
28:50 oh no
Smosh was the first YouTube channel I discovered
27:40 yea
The talk about fanfics at the end just makes this 😂😂😂😂
They’re back! So glad we can relive our childhoods one more time!! 😁
Wait, is that a perm?
Anyone know how much the deal was for?
What’s the milk fanfic
This is sooooo much nastalgia in one video
So ready for the new era! 🌚
Wonder why the YouTube Ogs are suddenly going back to their roots, Ian and Anthony, as well as Roi and Alex
Ian wont watch this episode either lol
Wow to have a friend from middle school to being successful is a dream, hopefully we all can have this type of friendship and drive to make it happen just wow man 🖤
Absolutely Inspirational and a great conversation
21:10 yea
I can't wait for the real Blockbuster movie about their lives, with some a-list celebrities playing Ian and Anthony 😂. A la The Social Network..
Such a great story and reminder that your failures don’t determine your success.  So happy to see you guys together and excited to see Smosh return to its roots  Props to R&L as well. Great guys.
Ok perfect, one step closer to smosh fortnite skins🙏
I missed the celebrity interview prank videos!!
19:20 yea
I have wanted this for the past decade.  You guys made my childhood, and after seeing so many of the greats retire or move on, this is truly something special.  Even if this venture crashes and burns, you will have at least 1 subscriber that will be with you guys until the end of the line.  Love you guys (no homo) (not that being gay is wrong) (I'm just not gay) (unless it's a three-way) (like if someone made a fan pic of Anthony, Ian, me, and some milk... I wouldn't be opposed to it)
"I still won't" lmao
So no more food wars 😢 1:01:45
16:40 yea
i loved the movie!
I love how Anthony nodded at nothing for two seconds straight at nothing at 1:01:59
They needed to prove themselves, Anthony found out his true creative self and Ian didn’t let go something really important to him, to overcome all the problems and difficulties Smosh went through, they are reunited today because them both are worthy, they are at the same level, they prove everyone what really are made of!
this was very sweet I wish you all the luck <3
As someone who didnt grow up watching smosh im excited to learn about the milk fanfic
Tbh while I love that they are making videos together again, I really hope this time they prioritise their friendship more because that’s what truly matters in life. I know they missed each other ❤️ I love them both and hope they are happy ❤️
this is the moment in the timeline that everything goes back to normal
"we we matched together in..." — Me: "OMGGGG TINDER!"  "... In a science project?"  — Oh, well...
I have so many great memories watching old school Smosh videos with friends back in the day😂. Seeing Anthony and Ian just light up and filled with energy when talking about writing sketches for the channel again... Bro, the feels. Really happy for u guys, and for us😂, that you're back! Much love
I loved the smosh movie and phone game 😢
WHATTTTTTTT
Full circle moment ❤️
Its going full circle
51:45 ANTHONY'S LAUGH!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
8:20 yea
I'm curious if Shut Up Cartoons would also be revived
I am so shocked I honestly love you guys and it made me super sad when you split love both of you guys content hope you guys Reunion goes well
If feels like the timeline is healing itself 😭
Can we give Ian credit for staying with smosh so it wouldn’t die. I feel bad that Anthony was able to leave and grow on his own but Ian stayed back “with the ship”
Falta que vuelva Patrik al doblaje latino!
I've loved Smosh over the years. In 2005 I was 5. I've grown along with the channel. As a kid I wanted to be them. I'm glad to see them own it together again. I always enjoyed watching Lunchtime with Smosh. While they were still doing their characters, I felt like it gave me a little more of a glimpse into who they were as people. I missed those videos and when they stopped uploading those videos I personally felt change was about at Smosh. We no longer had this glimpse of them passed the sketches. I hope to see more videos where we get to see them as people. This video has been great to watch.
My brothers and I would crowd together at our computer watching you guys throughout our entire childhood and now they’re almost reaching 30 and here we are talking about you guys once again. Good to see Smosh back again :)
so nice
This felt more like “I spent a day with Anthony” and Ian was the interviewers sort of.
BRING BACK BOXMAN!!!
I love you guys
Side note: I really enjoyed the Smosh movie.
So much happened here, and I’m so here for it 🤍
not my main focus being on the rock stuck in ians shoe
* Ian and anthony "what if *WE* bought smosh" *  Great minds do think alike.
YYYEEESSSSSYYEYEEAAHAHHHHYYEYEYYESSSSS
SMOSH is the channel this 10 year old watched that Pokemon music video for the first time. It's the channel that influenced and started sketch comedy on YouTube. Waited for every video to come out, slowly saw how it became so much, CORPORATE, that I moved away from it. I'm back watching all of the SMOSH content, glad to see this friendship healed and so much amazing content to come. FOOD BATTLE 2023!!!!. P.S. Dare you to bring back that EMO HAIRCUT.
Honestly I could always see that Anthony was loosing himself, it didn't feel right back in 2015-2017 it was a strange time. I'm glad you boys have grown and have gotten a better connection again
Missed you guys so much
Holy shhh... I just randomly went to this channel after a couple of years not visiting it, and this legendary collab was released a day ago
Not only did Rhet and Link give them back the brand they spent their entire youth creating but also a bond that got lost overtime 😭 i’m so happy
I really hope you guys take care of your friendship separately too <3
Can I buy Smosh? I have 37 dollars and a Hershey's bar.
😢 best highlight of my life
it took me a second to remember that anthony co founded smosh
IAN HAS A CHAIN WOAAHHHHHHHH
Hell yeah.
I was 7 when I first started watching them, I’m almost 19 now and I’m so happy they are back, massive nostalgia rn after I heard the news and I’ve been rewatching all the old videos ❤
Food battle 2023!🎉
Be me 24 (m) … Milk Fanfic?
Pardon me as I mop the tears off my floor
We need a I spent a day with matthias
I feel like timelines are converging and quests are getting fulfilled
The only joke in the Smosh movie that really made me laugh was when they went to find "Mr. YouTube" and the CEO of YouTube was actually named Mr. YouTube
This is Epic 🎉
it's been a while since i was this happy
I allways used to watch Mail time and Lunchtime.   My Girlfriend of 12 years  and I have so many inside jokes that stems from Ian and Anthony.  Hope they find success and happiness. I can't wait to see the road they take us on!
Im excited fir food wars
i was one of thous kids ahah and im pre hype that you guys are back !
These guys were my childhood <3
🎉🎉🎉🎉 so glad ur back together after year's
When I heard them say they bought Smosh at the beginning of this video, I really thought they were joking. Then I searched up the Smosh channel and my jaw was on the ground. This video has made my day I am so happy for you guys and I wish you the best of luck continuing forward. 💖
I remember watching you fellas for the first time on my iPod touch back when I was in like grade 2-3. My favourite stuff you guys did was the mail times cuz you seemed to be naturally funny fellows! Glad to see yous back ❤
This is gonna make me cry😢
Oh man, I forgot about the Watch Us Live and Stuff channel. Looking back, that must have been soooo much time "turned on" in work mode. So glad Anthony found some balance.
THE WORD "LIKE" HAS BEEN SAID:   By Anthony - 111 Times By Ian - 425 Times  CONCLUSION: Ian should read the vocabulary
it's all thx to their 6th grade science teacher
🖤🖤🖤
Ive waited so many years for this moment.
I was a kid when I watched Smosh and you made what I am today. In a good way
SO glad to see my brother (not really) and his friend reunite. I straight up grew up watching them, and I'm so excited to see what new Smosh looks like.
Two bros, sitting in front of a fireplace, 6ft apart because they're not gay.
I loved hearing how much both of them grew and worked on themselves in their own way. I'm so so proud of yall for that. it's not easy. you're very admirable 😭🩷🩷🩷
So Anthony leaving smosh was a cannon event for the future friendship of Ian and Anthony
I've been waiting for this from so long... i wish they do something stupid in this one like the earlier smosh videos
this is crazy
I was here!
i really loved the food battle videos. it was like the END year Event back then
I wanna know how much they paid for it
My favorite thing about the whole DEFY shutdown thing was when MatPat and Ian were talking about the DEFY shutdown and MatPat made it about how good a job he did when he was working for DEFY.
this is so amazing!! i love these two so much and i’m so happy to see their friendship blossom and i can’t WAIT to see what’s next from them!
Finally, a amazing thing to come from this year of negativity.
He found Anthony!
smosh is back, and they listened to refused together??? so sick so sick
Rhett and Link are such good dudes
there was one episode of a bts of a smosh video and seeing camera crews and lighting directors in their house or shooting house completely broke the 4th wall and made me realize that these internet shows are so much more than 2 guys and a camera.
I certainly hope that we as an audience can do better given what you shared with us. I apologize if in any way I contributed to some of that issue as a viewer. Do what you got to do dudes.
SHUT UP
Loved this I wish you all the success in the world
Great, now let's see Filthy Frank on Cold Ones.
I remember Smosh back in the day, that Zelda lip sync was a banger. So glad they were able to reconnect.
YouTube legends making Internet history again
Never unsubscribed… just didn’t have notifications now I got them notifications on full
Nature is healing
I love how Ian dressed like a male cougar, I love the video but I had to say it
this inspired me to start trying to reconnect with old friends
Seems like it would have been a good idea to talk about this stuff before buying a company together? Lol.  Best of luck yall. Its awesome to see you together again
The news we didn't know we needed to hear! Love this!! Congrats! 🎉🎉🎉 Adolescence nostalgia unlocked!  Bless!!!🎹💙🖖🏾
Don’t feel like you guys are bound to scripted content!!! Honestly some of my favorite teen memories on YouTube were of watching you guys do Mailtime with Smosh or Lunchtime with Smosh. Even Gametime with Smosh.   But at the end of the day is comforting to know that whatever content you guys put out, it’ll be Ian and Anthony again ❤
1:00:25 I feel so old now thinking of the fact that I have been watching Smosh for 17.5 years…. I’m only a year younger than Anthony and Ian! So happy to see Smosh back together ❤️
This absolutely makes me so happy
yall have good chemistry u shud make videos togethr more
this is such an intense story of good friends being forced apart by their careers. it just tugs on my heart strings that you guys come off detached in some instances, and others it seems like you're finally getting closure. i can't help but cry over how smosh was a blink in my childhood. to see you guys all grown up.
I gasped when I seen this
I mean 2023 shed some light in these dark times
does this mean food battles is coming back?
This took too long to happen
What about the cast?
Can you please interview nile red
you could make a movie of this story btw
We only had to sacrifice 5 billionaires in a submarine, but the deal with the devil has been made :)
A very insightful Smosh Retrospective
Tbh I feel if Smosh was always independent they’d experience the same burnout as Nigahiga. Ryan was always independent and did most of the admin work and big decision making. If they never got bought maybe both Ian and Anthony wouldn’t be here today. I’m glad that life has come full circle
I enjoy the fact that you're not going to just go back and play on the nostalgia of the old series, but I'm also really sad I won't see any more "pokemon in real life" or anything like that anymore
Even if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you. 🥲
I cried so much at the end ❤
This video has only been out a day and I’ve watched it like 3 or 4 times now already. This is just so surreal
Seeing an old love  reunite in the new era gives me hope
this is going to be the golden age of Smosh. one that isn't adulterated by corporate meddling or brand image or denial of feelings.  This time it's gonna be you guys doing what you want because you are your own bosses. And that's fantastic.
Started watching Smosh when I was 3, now I'm 78. Thank you Antony and Ivan!
Thanks
you guys broke the internet  with this news 😂 and as someone who has never watched SMOSH and will probably not be tuning in in the future (it's just not my type of content), I am truly happy for both of you. Even I (a non-fan of SMOSH) feels how right this is. And yeah, if you burn it to the ground, you burn that 💩💩 to the ground. It's your goddamn right.
This is beautiful
this is such a healthy video and it feels like parents having an open forum
At one point long after Smosh had changed ownership, they released an "unreleased" smosh video from the very early days that I grew up watching. It really stuck out in terms of humor and was so refreshing to see years after their content had changed to a more corporate feel. It was like watching a real new smosh video. Anyway seeing the two of them together again brought back that feeling.
Spend a day with Sam & Colby!
Signing up now. I love you guy and I’m so happy y’all are back together!
Finally. Peak
As someone who watched every single video up to the creation of Smosh Pit, I love the fact that you guys are willing to throw in easter eggs and references for the ones that were there for your early days and are excited to see your new beginning! Cheers to another 17 years guys 🍻
the milk fic…
I can't even believe this is real
HELL YEAH LET'S GOOOOOO 🎉
The OGs before Rhett and Link
You guys are truly my older brothers
I only hope they bring back food battle
You could tell Ian still has resentment towards Anthony but it makes sense . A lot of the responsibility did fall on Ian and it matured him greatly and made him way more stoic . He had to carry a lot of the burden and assume a leadership role in smosh and it took a toll on him . Anthony isn’t wrong either he wanted to find his own voice and the two became better people for it . Let’s hope that in the upcoming months and years Ian and Anthony can fully let go of the wall and become better friends for it .
it’s me I was one of the kids who watched smosh when they probably shouldn’t have
i am healing so much
Can Tennessee return for smosh?
Anthonys impression of Ian was spot on 😭
W❤
You should do a video acting out Smosh getting back together fanfiction’s
✨FRIENDSHIP ALWAYS WINS✨  🫸🫷
This already has over 13,000 comments, so I'm really just commenting into the void. However, if I am going to share something about this video into a void, I'm glad that one of my key takeaways was to value your friendships. <3
This is like if a remake of a really nostalgic childhood movie was actually good.  I am unbelievably excited.  The 10 year old in me can’t wait
shoutout to Rhett and Link for being absolute chads in keeping these boys' dream alive and selling it back to them when they were ready
Ledegends back together
I think some of you guys funniest stuff is hard to do now like the guns and gay jokes
This is the greatest thing to come out of YouTube. I am happy.
when i saw the vid on smosh i knew then and there that smosh is back. i am happier than ever to know my favorite channel as a kid is finally back. thank u smosh for bringing back old and good memories 🫶
only real ones remember molester moon
Please kiss I wanna see it so badly 😅
Ian is bored v2
The internet OGs baby 👏🏼🔥
Finally our dads are getting back together!!!!
Is this real?
Wonder if food battles will make a comeback
WHY AM I CRYING
Where's Peter?
My entire childhood...im not crying in joy and nostalgia...YOU ARE😭😭😭
I hope they bring back gang bangs like just dance and other things
First knowing them in the computer room of my primary school, I am now crying in front of my phone
new smosh was horribley bad sometimes ok  but true smosh was the best and greatestt
It’s so great to see these guys interacting again
41:00 it seems like the walls were still there but you two had grown bigger then them and could see past and step over them
His name is what now?  In all seriousness, Smosh was great.
i was one of the 9 year olds that grew up watching ur stuff :’) 21 and happy to see this, crazy
we can see their foreheads now ❤ i love u guys. my teenagehood.
Smosh was literally the definition of my childhood. I would religiously wait for a video to come out from them and watch it whenever they uploaded. I stopped watching Smosh after new members got introduced, but still, this warms my heart way too much. :,) It's way more then well deserved that they got their channel back--one that they should have rightfully owned to begin with.
Thats why communication is key.
Anthony and Ian are friends again. The Internet is healing ❤️
This is the best news I've heard all year! Glad you two are back together, and especially happy to hear you'll be be making the same style of vids as old Smosh but with fresh ideas!
FOOD BATTLE 2023 PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Still trying to get a mini fridge in my car… are you guys gonna save YouTube?
I was in 4th grade when i discovered you guys. I own two dogs and have a place with my girl now 😅
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Dude WHAT! "Sometimes existing is exhausting" you gained so much more respect than I already had for you. I wrote a poem a long time ago, a decade or so, starting with existing gets exhausting, and that's exactly how I felt. Mental health has always been hard for me.
Honestly this made my whole year so far. I used to be (yes sadly used to be) a HUGE Smosh fan, I was so sad for what happened to smosh over time and left because it wasn’t the same without Anthony AND Ian (I love the whole crew but it’s not the same). I’m really happy for you guys to have bought Smosh back! I really hope you both the best ❤️
Waiting to see this happen since i was like 12... THE TIME HAS COME!!
Never thought I’d re subscribe to smosh
shout out Mikey & Dianna. you some real ones
this is so fucking wholesome. I grew up watching these two and it makes me so happy to see them resurrect the channel and their friendships :) ALSO the milk fanfic mention LOL !!
Im finishing this Later...... Happy to see them try to work things out in general..... ❤😅
I remember being 5 and watching my first Smosh video on my mom's iPhone 4(?)  it was the video where Anthony was dressed as Miley Cyrus and Ian was the spokesperson thingy for donations to a charity for her 😭 I remember laughing so hard at that video and slowly as I grew up it was just Smosh everything, I watched every video at least 8 times, from Ian Is Bored to fan mail unboxing and laughing every time Ian yelled about silly bands or anything.  I'm still totally in shock that years later they bought Smosh back and Anthony is interviewing Ian and talking about everything and reuniting <33
Two bros Sitting in a filming room Five feet apart  Cuz they're OWNERS OF THEIR OWN BUSINESS  Let's go Smosh!!!
that teacher must feel like a king/queen
I feel like Vsauce inspired this a lot, after that interview with him and hearing how passionate he is about creating the videos.
Food battle 2023?
I’m so happy to see this video man
Interview RayWilliamJohnson
I feel like I’m dreaming! This is so great, I’m so happy to see you guys back together!!!!
I have cried off and on throughout this entire video. It’s partly to do with the nostalgic side of it all, yes. But seeing your friendship rekindle and buy the company back that you both created together.. GOODNESS! My heart! Also seeing the raw emotion and witnessing you guys bringing everything up to surface level is so healthy and healing for not only you guys, but for us who also mourned your separation. I’m overwhelmed with happiness for you guys. And I’m beyond excited to see what new stuff you create, as creators AND owners. 🥰
I have a really similar story to anthony - was in the hospital for a week with autoimmune diagnosis at 12. some friends brought in a huge card that was signed by almost everyone in the grade. I still have it 16 years later <3
This has been one crazy journey. Like most people, Smosh is what made me use YouTube and more than likely Smosh was the first channel I ever subscribed to. I’ve been subscribed to Smosh for nearly 18 years… that’s WILD
The OG.
My childhood 😭 ily both of you
All of us who have watched both of you from the beginning just wanna hug you two rn this is so unreal you are both back in Smosh together and having fun again and being yourselves and it's honestly just beautiful.
I feel old and excited
I have always loved smosh! I grew up watching you guys! I remember watching when I was in elementary school and my friends and I would count down every year to food battles! I’m 25 now 🥰 this is just the best thing that you guys are coming back together!❤ enjoy this new journey and new chapter together creating amazing content!!
This made me so happy. Resubscribing NOW.
I feel like a lot of this can be summed up with "It's amazing we're back, but we needed that break". You guys are amazing. You truly illustrated how important it was to go through what you did and how it made you grow, how you can grow apart but still find each other again. It's great to hear you both sharing all of this in as vulnerable of a way as we the audience will ever get. Friendships are some of the most important relationships we can have and your friendship is such a beautiful thing. I think a lot of people needed to hear some of the topics touched on here. Keep up the amazing work and I can't wait to see what you guys make together.
I wonder if they have seen GhettoSmosh yet
This Ian guy seems really great. Y’all should become a duo.
Someone's cutting onions around here while I'm trying to watch this
I love Smosh and I'm glad you're back together. Trying to guess what Smosh was with no idea about it sounds like the entire pile of Hollywood right now.
i really hope they bring back the "shut up" intro
Here are some alternate titles for this video SMOSH the interview. the return of SMOSH and SMOSH reunites with SMOSH
11:37 that edit so clean and could altered into many form for out of context
The only nostalgia I need in these new skits is that lawn flamingo hidden in the background somewhere.
Hehe cox
The return of the Gods
Red string theory confirmed
i say this anywhere i see you two together nowadays, but thank you both for making my childhood even more AWESOME then it would have been without smosh <3
countdown to food battle 2023
I feel like this day the internet won. Congratulations, I can't even say how happy I am for you guys, my cheeks hurt from quite literally smiling all the way through the ENTIRE video! ❤
I think Ian should bring back the bowl haircut and Anthony should bring back the emo haircut. Also, FOOD BATTLE.
looks like i am no longer going to need hulu
Imagine food battle 2023
Cheers🥂 to ya'lls health ❤️ and a new Smosh era🥛😜
This is awesome guys, right here watching u guys from the first day! Also growing up with u! Congratulations!!
Is Anthony gay or sum
I’ve been watching Smosh since the beginning and this has made my whole entire year!!
DO LUNCH TIME WITH SMOSH 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Nothing major, not a lot of editing, not a lot of production, just you guys having lunch once a week, and being yourselves and finging twitter questions. Silly stuff 🥹🥹🥹 I will support no matter what you make,  but omg LUNCH TIME W/ SMOSH would make the world a better place
To celebrate they should bring back there best series for one last episode being food battle
YES
This is so refreshing thanks for clearing the air before just moving forward. Always a fan of you two.
I mean honestly, this is like if adam savage would just bring jamie and the whole myth buster squad back
"My BFF, I'm glad you're back and everything's all good. These gross hobos are trying to kill us now, so let's get the f**k out of the hood. B, We are the bestest friends. F, We'll never fight again, Other F, I'm happy to amend And defend. Comprehend. On depend. My beeeeest frieeend."
i like how this wasn't a perfect reunion - that theres still things to work on and learn. but they are trying.
Love hearing grown men have healthy conversations!!!!!!
So excited. Been a fan since 2013
THE BOYSSSS! THERE BACK, AT LONG LAST!!!!
This is a historic moment
I better get a new food battle it would be amazing
Bring back Ghetto smosh
Ian says ”like” a lot. Like, really, like, a lot.
IAN DOESNT SEEM TO REALLY WANT OLD SMOSH BACK
Cool.
I think that the milkfic reference was the thing that truly sealed it
Ghetto Smosh, the only thing to reunify Ian and Anthony
I still can’t get used to you guys without your bowl and emo haircuts. They were a big part of my childhood
Happy you two are healing your relationship. Much rather see you be friends than have another smosh tho, both is great but take care of your friendship first ❤
Seeing my two favorite youtubers talk and hug and re buy Smosh brings me to tears.
I feel like Ian is reluctant to open up yet. But also, he is a Sketch person. Opening up candidly Infront of a camera is not his forté. Also, I am just a person observing from the outside. These are two 3 dimensional people. Going through a honest but deeply personal talk. A lot of it which they just brought up for the first time just then. One thing I am sure of, the new older "them" must be uncharted territory still in different and subtle ways. That is a lot of new bridges to build. I am sure there is a lot going threw their minds and that is for them to figure out.  At first, I thought that he was just being protective of the brand he kept alive. But when he said "We will do it. That or we burn it down together as Smosh should end."  I knew 2 things for certain then: 1) It isn't Smosh that Ian is reserved about. 2) He still cares an awful lot for Anthony and what their friendship means to them.  ...what's the milk fanfic?
FOOD BATTLE PLZ!!!!!
1:28 thank God for them being pair together, and the teacher too I guess lol
foodbattle 2023??
A good smosh movie would be about Ian and Anthony's story and the history of YouTube culture, how it all turned out over the years. Now THAT'S a movie I'd want to watch
So my comment is absolutely going to get buried and I don’t think anybody’s gonna see it, but I’m gonna say it anyway.  This is the most perfect example of male emotional maturity that I have ever seen. You guys have shown how to regulate and deal with a highly stressful, emotional and difficult situation by using dialogue and awareness of how the other might be feeling. You’re showing all the young boys out there who have been influenced by toxic masculinity how to resolve a difficult situation using words which lift each other up and replacing resentment and confusion love, compassion and friendship.  I’ve been following you guys since 2007/8 and I have to say I couldn’t be more proud. You’ve grown up with your audiences and it absolutely shows  Rock on lads show us what you got.
1:09:13 um, is that RuneScape music in the background?
I thought they were joking at first, but I'm excited to see where they'll take Smosh, very fond memories of all their stuff from the past.
Bro was at his lowest and it was only $4? Chump change my brother.
Been watching Anthony and Ian for 16 years, so amazing to see you guys sit down and talk about what really happened. Thank you to both of you for the almost 20 YEARS!!! of content. Much Love <3
Exellent video it’s so exciting to see my childhood duo reuniting and working together again.  Also I would love to see you spend a day with James Rolfe/Cinemassacre/TheAngryVideoGameNerd
Life as a way turning your past mistakes and difficulties into great gifts ✌❤  Truly happy for both if you, and for us who will be able to watch Smosh as it was meant to turn into
anyway i will be ensuring the fanfics come back again 💖
So excited for this! Top 10 Anime Redemption Arcs for sure!  It’s so interesting to see Ian’s side of things and why he stayed when Anthony left. That he was just being pragmatic, like “k I get it but even if it’s not perfect, we still have this thing, and it’s huge and I can’t lose it.”  Super cool to see their dynamic after all these years, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for them!
I fucking love these too immaculate kings. These two literally started my childhood on YouTube. I think both of them and I wish you great. Blessings on these two.
so no food wars? 😢
Okay but can we talk about how every time Anthony does these, there's a new tattoo. Lol.  I'm not sure how long he's had his neck one (ive been gone a lil and obviously i had to watch this).
God this is so nostalgic kinda got emotional these two guys were like the backbone of my childhood
God this is so nostalgic kinda got emotional these two guys were like the backbone of my childhood
Food battle 2023 when? 😂😂😂
my entire childhood was built upon smosh. SO happy to see yall coming back together
So, I didn't grow up with Smosh, I only discovered the channel last year through try no to laugh compilations. I have never seen old Smosh, I had no idea who Anthony was until I looked him up to get context for some of the jokes about him being gone. After getting an idea of what Smosh started as and what it is now, it was still very clear to me that it was different. It is also pretty clearly not doing too well. Obviously it's got millions of subscribers so you know, it's not nothing; but it feels like it's on the back 9 for sure. It feels like something that's clinging. This is a super brave business decision for you guys and honestly, I think it'll work. It's really heartwarming to see you guys take the reigns back to something that is basically an amalgamation of your personal relationship with each other and I have a feeling that it will resonate with others and result in something beautiful.
As someone who's been watching smosh for a decade I am so excited to see what you both have planned for the future. I was 10 when I started watching you guys and I gave continued to watch both of you as you have grown and I'm so excited for this new era of smosh!
32:31 that high five instantly reminded me of the “Friendship Always Wins” poster, what a time to be alive
So happy to see the rebirth of a great era coming to this era of YouTube! You two got this!
My childhood is all coming back and I’m so happy about it first wasabi and now smosh
I feel like a little Emo right now, so emotional and I feel I’m back in 2007❤
I don’t trust Ian
Smosh as I knew and religiously watched years ago died when Anthony was gone and I blame Defy for being too hands on for this. I didn't like much of the content afterwards but Ian really did keep it afloat.
In this episode it gets very clear to see how much of a mature character @AnthonyPadilla is. He keeps digging deep into his memories and pain, reflecting and talking about it, but getting cut off and not being brash about it, but taking a pause to listen. Listen to how it might evolve the conversation, and try to find a good point forward in the conversation. I'm in awe. Good job, Anthony.
both of these niggas look hella gay in their own way
It's so nice having Anthony being invited by Ian in the show
Lmao we need a smosh bio pic which Ian and Anthony played by like,,, Tom holland and Chris Pratt or something stupid like that.
58:05 Reminds me of Elton John and his longtime collaborator. He writes the lyrics and Elton writes the music. I think sometimes people underestimate how much two people who work differently can compliment each other’s style and make a product that is so much better than what either two could make by themselves.
The universe is healing <3
The day we needed but didn’t deserve.
so the first video is gonna be food wars right?
I'm so happy they are back!❤
The world is healing bois
ngl i'm getting so teary eyed. i'm so happy this story has a good end.
I loved smosh the movie because it looked like you guys were having fun creating it hahahah. I bought and still own it
This was a interesting watch! I never watched Smosh personally. But it was the Pokémon lip sync video that made me discover YouTube when it was new.
Up until this very moment, I forgot smosh the movie was ever a thing
THE MILK FANFIC OH MY GOD! I had completely forgotten about it!! The milk fic, the hat fic, and the chair fic were the unholy trinity of trauma for my little 13 year old self... what a terrible throwback.
Rhett and link talked about male friendships on there podcast so its great to see ian and anthony share theor story. Here for it🎉
Peak video
i enjoyed the smosh movie. yo i still have the dvd. i remember telling my mom i need it bruh.
Has Anthony dropped the hair care routine ? I’m asking for a friend…
So Anthony had aids?
I was a kid when i found the videos, i was 10 years old fan! My minecraft name was made from Ian, because i was so much fan of Ian ❤
I remember using the video camera app on my 3ds to record The Legend of Zelda Rap and the Firetruck song when I was 10 years old to listen to when I was offline because we didn't have internet growing up. I'm 21 now and I can spit every bar to both of those songs still because of that.
From minute 8:00 to 10:00 is the best way to not admit you were just a little more immature than most for you’re guys age at the time without turkey saying it, Kids found you funny and who got hurt by it? No one
Shut up lmao
Congratulations for both of you! Glad you got Smosh back! I hope this is an opportunity to create new memories with a renewed and more authentic version of Smosh than before!
Hello there, I just wanted to share that Jesus Christ loves you and died for your sins so that you can have a relationship with God the father and be restored. If you want a relationship with God all you have to do is confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is lord and that He died for you! And turn to him in repentance of your sins. You don’t have to live life on your own anymore! God will change your life forever, I promise there is hope! He did it for me! There is a God and I am His witness. The choice is yours, have a great day :) God loves you so much!
Moral of the story: Go to Therapy y’all!! 😂
The I Spent A Day With Series Is Now Officially Over
OH MY GOD??
wooooooooo! food fight 2023
It's incredible that I also remember the time I first watched the pokemon lip sync video and I loved it. I was like 7 when I saw that, man. You guys have been a pretty large chunk of my childhood.
So we’re getting food battle 2023/4 right?
I've been a fan of smosh since 2013 and I've been a consistent supporter even if anthony left back then. I love the transparency of this video because I would have never imagined what they ACTUALLY went through, especially from both sides, and I'm glad they finally had the chance to be vulnerable and be honest with each other and to us, the audience. I can't wait for the future projects and endeavors of smosh. LETS GOOOO !!!
Hearing this conversation was so incredibly hard.
Ill never forget dixon cider was what made my family force me to stop watching smosh and instead watch tobuscus only but i never stopped
Happy Tears
Love you guys
Glad to see you both back together. And talking honestly. Loved your interview Anthony with Howie Mandel on his podcast. Your association with Defy at least brought attention for us  with special talents such as Courtney, Shayne, Keith, Olivia & Noah.
Can confirm I was a child who watched smosh and probably shouldn’t have lol
This is such an awesome vulnerable video, and like you said, a great "case study" on how a fun idea between good friends can lead to such highs and lows you'd never anticipate happening. Congrats on reclaiming your channel, your identities, and your friendship! <3
this is the good ending
now that i’m older like they said i was a kid binging their videos, i am seeing the grown up side of this n i never thought about or knew and it’s just crazy to see the behind the scenes and the effects this could put on your guys life but thanks for being apart of my childhood and truly happy to see u guys back and exited to see what comes!
Grow your beard again! You looked dope.
I love seeing you together again!
Thanks for making this video man 😭
The way your production team applies the bleep is amazing by the way. I can't express enough how annoying hearing a bleep is, but the soft static sound is easier to ignore and still gets the job done. It breaks away from the content a lot less
Ian is that friend that is super chill and reserved, meanwhile Anthony is the soul and drive of the friendship. Really glad you guys reconciled and happy that you guys manage to find your friendship out of smosh🙏
23:25 looking back it makes sense that Anthony didn't want to collab. He wanted to find his own thing and didn't want the smosh logo on his back for his future endeavours.
W
bring back lunch time with smosh
Holy fucking god bro, this is like my childhood resurrected....
Idk why but they kinda looked like and giving the vibes of james franco and seth rogen in this video lol
❤❤❤
I’m cryyyying about the butts out hug. So much has changed yet nothing has changed. You two!!! My heart!!! 🥹
Ian and Anthony sold Smosh to Defy was a canon event for this to happen
As someone who was there from the very beginning it was evident what was going on between you both when Anthony left but not Ian. Im very glad you guys mended that friendship and are both going to be there to revitalize Smosh. Like everyone has already said- my inner child is healing 😌
Is there a generation of people who don’t even know what classic smosh is? Or maybe their content was so good back then that they are still getting new viewers today?
I feel like I’m watching couple’s therapy
You guys seem to click, maybe you guys should make videos or something
We watching this because these two guys have real happiness when they being together 😭😭😭😭😭 Good to see this again , thanks for letting this happen 😭😭😭
This fills me with so much nostalgia. I am so happy to see these guys together again
a minute in and i just hope there’s one “SHUT UP” in here
I think what Ian was getting at around halfway through the interview is that, the time spent apart on top of his final impressions and feelings towards Anthony made him feel like reaching out would be pointless, because the human mind will more or less fill in details. He probably felt like there was a lot of animosity from Anthony when there really wasn't anything to worry about, but that anxiety made him very hesitant to be the one to reach out, so the middleman was CLUTCH.
Who? Jk  Glad you guys are back together.  And congratz on rebuying smosh.
I watched every single skit, lunchtime with a smosh and gaming content as a kid and teen. These two shaped so many peoples humor and the gratitude I have for their honesty is immense.
Words cannot describe how happy it makes me seeing you guys together again after all these years. I was in high school when I watched you guys in Smosh (I'm 30 now). I did fall off from Smosh altogether when you guys split years ago and just recently came back to Smosh in the last couple years (I found your channel in the last year or so Anthony). But hearing all the stuff you guys had been through when you dealt with Defy and how that affected not only the way you processed things but also ultimately how you saw each other, I feel for you both. I can't begin to imagine how I'd handle a situation like that. It's sad that it cost you guys your friendship for as long as it did but I am glad that you guys are able to come together again and you both look so much happier for it. May you both have a greater friendship from now on and may Smosh be everything you both dream it could be! I wish you both luck and look forward to seeing what you create! 😊❤
this is huge
This is honestly such an exciting time for Smosh! Also the reunion of two friends is such a hope inspiring story, and the vibes are all on point
12:10 If take a snippet of every "Bro Moment" where they're just stroking eachothers girthy egos. You can take those and make this the most romantic, erotic love story. 😂😂❤❤
Smosh and Jacksfilms are the remainders of the Old Guard of YT. All the others have fallen or left  Ooh the email part I felt that. We did the exact same thing at earth fare. We grabbed some of the beer in the store and lit up some joints and dicked around in the store and raided 1000s in groceries. We even unhooked our security cameras from the server. Spray painted fuck the company president everywhere.
ITS FINALLY BACK! ive been around since the start of it all and to see yall get back together is so lit!! you guys are goats of this youtube shit!! btw im the guy who said “your hair looks like you sold your company for free” guy and i said that cause i thought it was so insane you guys did that cause i knew from the start yall were gonna be famous!! happy to see its all coming together as planned!!
Yeah! That powerful of the friendship!!! :D 🌈✨
Ian's maturity is outstanding
Hear me out: Smoshcast
like
Rhett and link. Scooby and shaggy. Anthony and Ian. Beast boy and cyborg
Therapy is fucken awesome.
Only real on remember Lunch TIme with Smosh
My life is complete again
I love this:''uuu AHHHHHHHHHH
Honestly I like the new smosh, instead of just two main personalities like in the past there is now a very dynamic group of people and seeing their chemistry and differing personalities is what makes it so fun.  I know these won't be changed but I sincerely hope they don't overshadow the rest of the cast. Instead of bringing back the past, they should adapt to the current audience. But I have faith they know what to do.
Rhett and Link were there to save Anthony and Ian's Smosh. Bestfriends helping bestfriends.
I love Ian Peacox 💚💚
This video kinda made me emotional because as I got older watching SMOSH I kinda got a feeling something was going behind the scenes as the skits became more numerous and more produced by a company than peoples. I’ve been waiting for this for awhile now, and a little bit of my childhood has now returned

You and this Ian guy have great chemistry! Have you considered starting a channel together?
One day I hope to work for these men. I’ve watched them for years and I’m just so happy They’re literally back on the same page and back together. SMOSH forever
I am so happy for you two, and for all of us 🎉
Literal dream come true. 😭 I am so happy you two are friends again.
Oh no not the milk fan fic...
This whole conversation is so healthy and a really good example of how people can talk about their past and bond.
Wow never thought this would happend but Im so happy. This must have been such a full circle, healing experience for the both of you 🤍 wishing you guys all the luck!
Man this is like my childhood right here I grew up on all the food wars and all the music videos was a big smosh fan so happy to see these guys together again it makes my heart whole a bit
Love seeing y'all be honest with each other.
30:40 That kind of situation was very similar to how Mixer shutdown without telling ANY of their employees and they all found out from a tweet
was Smosh the Movie a good movie? no, but does a movie need to be "good" to be enjoyable? no! some of the most enjoyable movies are objectively terrible. I enjoyed the movie when I saw it at 17 and I would probably enjoy it now at 25 for the nostalgia lmao
FOOD WARS RETURN
Friends are friends until the end. So glad to see you two hanging out and being happy with the new projects. All the luck and love for u fellas.
wow cultural reset
“We weren’t making content for kids” Y’all were also in middle school when SMOSH started! We all grew up together! Your humor evolved as you grew <3
These boys sure had glow-ups.
no more pressing f to pay respects Time to press W for a better tomorrow.
Damn seeing 2 men talk so freely about their feelings is such a breath of fresh air💛
It’s finally happening I’m so hyped
I stopped watching after Anthony left, and how things went for Ian, i couldn't watch it, but I'm glad that they are back, can't wait to see what they have
a
I don’t really comment on videos, and I have to say I’m happy for them both BUT Anthony seems more ecstatic to see and talk to Ian again. On Ian’s part he either seems (in my opinion) like he doesn’t fully want to be there bc his friend pushed him or he hasn’t fully let down his guard and has some doubts. He seems so stiff and serious compared to Anthony who is acting like a kid seeing his bff again. Nonetheless, I hope this is the beginning of a forever strong friendship. 54:13
Am happy af to see this
Ian and Anthony buy Smosh: Everyone liked that
I'm sobbing dude 😭
Anthony with no emo haircut and Ian with no bowl cut is messing with my brain.
Shout out to Rhett and Link for saving Smosh at their lowest point and being supportive of Anthony and Ian's friendship reuniting.
Screw you Ian, Smosh,  the Movie was fantastic.
holy shit, i totally forgot about the Mortal Kombat lipsync lol wow
I literally spent my teenage years singing sex ed, i know what smosh is
ASSASSINS WEED OUTFIT
If Ian and Anthony can heal so can I
This is so great to see. I feel like I don't recognize anyone on YouTube anymore so to see familiar faces feels like home.
the REAL hour long smosh special
YouTube history right there
they were my childhood. love smosh forever! 🤍
them talking about memberships to sort of crowd fund video made me think of Corridor, maybe if this new smosh era works well the smosh website could be like the corridor website.
The world can now begin to heal
Congratulations Ian and Anthony!!!
I am very happy for both of them.
Will this show be on Smosh?
Its been a while since I saw Smosh and at the time Anthony was still there. So basically i skipped a lot of years and now you guys are back. Feels like a full circle moment.
I teared up at the end with what Ian said 😭.
create art again.
Do i spent a day with ians mom
Two guys, sitting by a campfire, 5 feet apart because it's best for the camera angle.
This is such an open conversation that I am so grateful to witness. I wish everyone the best, to be able to be genuine and creative, not letting red tape get in the way.
All the verified accounts in these comments showing love for the boys being back 😩💙 i love it.
I'm almost 18 and grew up with Shmosh 🥹
This makes me wanna tell somebody i love them
I love how Anthony is blinged tf out! 😂 Love the tats too, so cool.
Oh god, I'm crying now. I was part of that child fanbase back in the day, and being able to see you guys grow is the same way I feel when I see my own brothers grow. 🥹🩷 Your care toward your own wellbeing, your vulnerability, your dynamic... Just amazing.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE THE VERY FIRST I SPENT A DAY WITHS!!!
Make a new link outfit!!!
I remember even as a kid, I felt that the Smosh brand had their hands dipped in TOO MUCH. Too many channels, etc. I could FEEL the burnout radiating off of Ian and Anthony. They seemed stressed and tired. Hearing them finally talk about it now means a lot.
Real question who took the link and assassins creed outfits 😂 I just wanna know who has it😂
Ive saw a lot of hate towards the video's sponsor elsewhere. Please go look up the issues with them and do some research before signing up in case that hate is justified.
Cryingg! So happy for you!
even though smosh started a decline since anthony left. ian deserves so much credit for being the sole leader and stepping up. i can’t wait for 17 more years of smosh now that the two are back together
this is everything we’ve waited for, for many years and all of us have been WAITING for this. Thank you and I’m so happy SMOSH is back. ❤❤
Oh the fanfictions are DEFINITELY gonna start again. Ive never read any but now i'm curious about the immediate effects of this reunion so please hold as i look into this subject and the numbers associated.
Cryingg! So happy for you!
I started watching smosh in kindergarten, so to see them back together is really amazing.
This is the right time. This Patience is such a virtue. I've been a fan since the old days. Take as much time to collaborate with the fire you guys started with!
so glad you guys are back together
This feels like when Queen broke up and then came back right before Livee Aid, THEY ARE BACK BABY
This video is AMAZING 🙏🙏
Just wanted say, when I learned that Anthony created Smosh and Ian joined him to be co creators, I always thought of Anthony as Smosh's mom because he physically created Smosh and Ian was Smosh's dad because he helped it grow.    However, with Ian's Get Well Card being the catalyst to make Smosh just solidify Ian as Smosh's father.    Smosh was literally conceieved over Ian's get well card, if that doesn't prove the mom and dad dynamic these two had relating Smosh, i dont know what else to tell you
I only knew Anthony from his insightful Podcast, then watching this and the Rhett and Link connections to Smosh appearing in videos = I am excited to discover Smosh.  So cool to see grown men discussing their feelings about their relationship in a respectful manner.   Great leadership and being a change in the world.
Next food battle?
My childhood is complete It’s been 6 years Thanks Ian and anthony❤
I watched Smosh as a 16 year old in 2012, became an adult and now you telling me I am going to watch them again? Dream comes true.
Why do the comments have so many likes it means nothing
This is a comment.
mama y papa
I'm sure this'll be a slow moving train to get going again!! But I feel like the glory days of YouTube are gonna come back
Anthony is the head in the clouds and Ian is the feet on the ground. They balance each other so well and the internet is glad to see this OG duo back together.
I hope going forward their channel continues to evolve instead of being stuck in the 2000's again
Ian and Anthony have the greatest friendship I have ever seen
Waiting for a food battle 2k23
Food battle 2023
when anthony started crying and ian said “i still wont” 😭
The walls are kinda still there, but so miniscule and transparent that they both see trough them. And they both know it. It's a beautiful synergy that has come together after this long process of growing. This is so beautiful and inspiring for me to try to achieve same, cos I need it
I’m 24 now, I was probably 9/10 years old when I started watching smosh.  Great to have grown WITH you boys and to see that life really isn’t that simple, it isn’t black and white and nobody is riding off into the sunset. It’s trial and error
Ummm so what is the milk fanfic? 😂 Now I'm curious
It's like the creation of Adam all over again.
Thank you guys for being so transparent and honest about your journey and what happened with the company and between you two. I'm super excited to see what you guys are going to create again 😍
INTRO: SHUT UP! (only smosh og's will know this into) This is the video that Anthony show's that he still really loves ya man and now you guys have smosh again!  Better love story than twilight.
Pokémon in real life reboot???
Smosh the movie was everything don’t say it was bad again! I’m 24 now and still miss watching it but can’t find it! I used to watch it over and over and over again!
With all my old favourite YouTube channels and groups dissolving and falling apart, all the seemingly unending  scandals, to hear something like this... It's just the best news ever. I absolutely can't wait for that first sketch
I am so happy about this. I miss sketch comedy so much. And seeing them together. I could even listen to a podcast! Haha
Am I the only one who thinks that they were saying firetruck and beeped it?
Better have food battle 2023 on the way
Ayy the squad back together. And both was trending number 1 and 2 same time!!
You appealed to children because of nostalgia, we grew up with Pokémon and other cartoons, children love cartoons!
This was rawer than I suspected, kudos to the both of you.  I hope you two grow back into the friendship that you once had.
This is gonna be great! Smosh reuniting, my and our childhood returns 😭🥹😄🥲💙💚
This entire interview unlocked the giddy exciting feeling I haven’t had since I was a preteen watching their videos 😭👏🏻
Anthony crying is beautiful, but lets take a moment for Ian putting all of his emotions in "like"
This is very nice
crying bc their energies still match after all these years, that’s true friendship. :’)
Smosh is back, Daxflame is back . Jake and Amir make occasional videos,  My childhood has been restored.  Never really realized the same thing kind of happened to Jake and Amir. College humour was bought out by Sam Hyde who gave the rights back to Jake and Amir directly . Just like Rhett and Link bought smosh, to one day sell back to the boys.
Wow, what a huge turn of events. I used to love Smosh, but after Anthony left I really never watched it again. I actually never thought about Smosh again until I saw this vid in trending. Crazy to get more of the story between what happened to you two after so many years.
Smosh fans rejoice!
The internet is healing.
Crazy how mature Ian is now
Foodbattle anyone?
In conclusion, they both needed each other. Both creatively and emotionally
I like smosh pit and the old sketches, but the every ___ ever series was never once funny and when the main channel turned into that i unsubbed to it
34:39 woo Mykie
personally i loved the smosh movie as a kid
What happened to SMOSH reminds me of Wayne's World the movie.
❤❤ all we need now is a new ISMFOF collab 😂
IM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!  I watched Smosh from the beginning all the way up to every blank ever.... thats when I kinda stopped but I went back and resubbed yesterday!!! Cant wait!!!!!!
The first food wars was so incredibly fun and the music video keep me laughing, can't wait to see this new Smosh
Video Idea:  I spent a day with fan artists to find the truth about chonky pikachu.
They are like brothers!! Best friends for life!!
💙
yess
I am SO STOKED on this reunion and will definitely become a member! I have so much faith that you guys will be even better than before. But it’s not official until you guys do another song with I Set My Friends on Fire 🔥
🎉🎉🎉🎉
The world is healing!
It wasn’t a stage, it’s not nostalgia, you BOTH make a great team and feed off each other to make something so funny and so good! I just became a member
dont worry for the fanfics, we'll get writing right away :D    jk lol happy this is happening <3
This is the first time we’ve ever seen them in a room together
Omg! Imma cry! This is- i have no words! The collab we have always waited for!!!!
Original SMOSH games COMING BACK?
Man, I feel like I shouldn't be watching this video. They really let the walls down and exposed their vulnerable side on this one
Bring back food battles
Friendship wins
Fuck, the reconnecting as friends discussion at 42:00 got me. I reconnected with my childhood best friend last year after we just drifted apart after high school due to college, work and other life stuff. Then we realized the neither of us knew why we fell out of contact other than that we both just thought the other person was off enjoying their own life.
I think a lot of this sums of the dreams of a comedian for me or wanting to create content. Just that stone cold wall of trying to find your voice and being judged by everyone for it. This is where I have my respect for so many YouTubers, the sheer amount of will it takes to put your creative ideas at such an Unpolished state on the internet to potentially share it with the world. That amount of criticism over such an early idea can kill so much drive.
Ian is HOT sign me for that OF right now ♥ XD
Anthony why are you still wearing skinny jeans
We want Food Battle 2023!
To be fair me getting into Smosh was because "I suck at draw something" kept showing up in my feed and by the end of it 10-11 year old me lost her shit
Food battle 2023 when?
I saw the one where y’all made a joke about cantaloupe when I was a child. And I made that my whole personality from there on. I’m 23 now. Thank you guys for brightening my childhood ❤️
This video brings me so much joy. Smosh is back!
Damn I cried several times lol
This was like a much needed therapy session between you two. I could hear it.
welll you have spent more than just a day with this guy
When ian went "Smosh was created seventeen and a half years ago." I literally imitated the wow meme unironically and went "JESUS CHRIST" like crit1cal. I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS, IVE BEEN WATCHING IAN AND ANTHONY SINCE I WAS LIKE 12. I AM NOW 25 AND I STILL WATCH. THE DARK AGES ARE PAST US. WE LIVE ON INTO A NEW ERA OF GREAT AND HOPEFULLY PERMANENT CHANGE!! LOVE YOU GUYS
u can do fresh stuff but u should still do food battle
Rhett and Link are so amazing
It's insane to think Ian and Anthony almost fell completely out of being friends. It's so true that what you see on the screen or in acting is not necessarily accurate. These are well rounded guys. I'm glad they figured everything out and have been healing the friendship. Smosh or no Smosh, content and personal channels or not... these two have an incredible history and that just can't turn to dust.
Mailtime w/ Smosh??
I hope they get enough funding to produce sketch comedy. i respect their love for sketch comedy entertainment. Even if it gets demonitised. Purely for the love for entertainment and for the laughs.
This is the redemption arc.
This is awesome! Bring back lunchtime with Smosh!! 😄✨🤩🥳🎉🎊
i knew it, you guys were going to give it a shot one more time. I am glad this is happening
I hope this means everyone from the old smosh channel is fired... they all had extremely punchable faces, especially Shayne.
I was asking in one of anthony's video - i think the one with Michael from Vsauce.   Then days later the news came out.
This is the hour long special we needed ❤
Sees title  Everyone liked that
So are we getting another food wars😢
If only drake and Josh could’ve had this conversation 😢
* the title gave me whiplash😭 omg I missed you guys together
This is really amazing.
Nostalgia
I am so insanely happy for both of you. You deserve the best guys and thank you for building upon my childhood.
I love Anthony so much. It's great that he can tap into his emotions and is grateful and compassionate. I love him sm
Seeing this video was surreal because i first looked at it I was like oh anthony padilla is interviewing ian hecox, that's the smosh guy, and the realization of WAIT THEY'RE BOTH THE SMOSH GUYS was insane to have
This is not a collab, its a reunion.
The second I realized that Smosh was reunited tears started pouring down my eyes and I'm so excited for future Smosh videos with Anthony
Happy for both of you! Take things slow, your friendship is like a marathon (: excited for the things to come!!! <3 best of luck
There is a lesson that I learned from this: anything meant to be, meant to be.
10:28 I am one of them. I absolutely loved that movie.
This video was everything I ever hoped for. Just to know the behind the scenes and just hearing Ian and Anthony talk about their own pov was really intriguing to listen to. Total change from Smosh’s silliness to a real mature conversation
This vid articulates so clearly my emotions of fear and excitement when changing stages of life. Ive transitioned from college to the job market, and now am going back to med school in a few months.  It’s been a wild period of transition.  It’s easy to feel directionless. It’s easy to feel like you’re a bad person when you fall out of touch with friends. It’s easy to resent others for either moving on faster than you, or staying to cultivate a career/friendship you moved on from.   Thanks for reminding me that my true friends and I will come back together in small ways, and that change is hard but not bad.
Holyfuck
Can’t believe it’s been 17 years, I’m old! Lol but thank you sincerely for raising me smosh dads <3
USED TO BINGE WATCH LUNCHTIME WITH SMOSH IN A HOMELESS SHELTER  WELCOME BACK GANG
Nature is healing
So so so happy for you guys (and all of us too)
I feel like I'm watching a really important therapy session and i am thrilled to see it
Watching this interview, I notice that there are a lot of parallels to Taoism. Especially with the constant talking of 'letting go', and not forcing things. When Ian said "this is the Way", that is what solidified it for me. Yes, this could be a Mandalorian reference, but considering that they didn't add onto the Madalorian, and the context was more serious and 'cosmic', we'll just say, I choose to think that the Tao had a hand in this. Good luck in your endeavors Ian and Anthony!
oh my god congrats on Smosh again  Also Rhett and Link are so sweet those two are like Youtube super heroes
Now more than ever we need a smosh summer games
Yay
Honestly this is the light in the world we needed rtn. So happy to see you guys reconnect and show how much you've both grown.
so excited for the new videos with you both! I loved the pokemon skits, my favorite being the real life trainer battles. Love you both
I’m so happy 😭😭😭😭
It was a canon event
Only thing that would top this is Daft Punk getting back together.
So glad you guys finally collabed for the first time
Man I like it
What happened to Anthony? It looks like he fell asleep and a toddler drew all over his body with a marker or something. What are those random lines?
It seems like Smosh is back but better than ever !
I truly loved your prank interviews. Esp with Tom Hiddleston. Would love another series on that!
Now we need a “I Spent A Day With The Smosh Cast”
Never thought I'd see them together again
As a kid, I’ve missed smosh so much, with this comeback, I’ll be happy to the fullest
I might be a naysayer and completely wrong (I hope I am) but Anthony is coming off as a huge opportunist and his motives don't seem entirely friendly.
I’ve been wondering for like 10 years if there was an explanation for the ring finger disease joke in the movie😂
I used to watch a lot of Smosh and i'm sooo glad Ian and Anthony are finally revisiting. And I'm also getting emotional.
Is it just me or Ian is saying the word “like” waaaaaay too much.  Anyway… Super happy they’re back!
Both of these guys are so insightful and understanding. Even though they struggled, they show compassion for each other now. Thank you guys for supplementing my childhood and my life now!
mom and dad still poke
you both are so gay now happy pride month
they're so bbg
I know you dont want to make anything nostalgia bait-ey, but we NEED Food Battle XII.
FOOD BATTLE 2023!!!
Anthony said it earlier, this totally is an episode of Maury
Rhett and Link being fantastic behind the scenes is so lovely to hear
41:59, does ian hate Anthony or wat?..i don't understand
PUT THIS ON YOUR HOME CHANNEL
just a group therapy session lol i’m here for it
What a bizarre life you live. Such desperation for attention.
Those flies and Poop animations confused the shit out of me😂😂
I’ve watched SMOSH since I was still very young and seeing these two together just makes me happy
I love you guys
Ever since Anthony left, Smosh just went downhill and wasn't what it used to be Now that Smosh is back and they'll be doing classic videos, It's all going uphill from here
Could this mean... We'll finally see how their 1 hour walk through the neighborhoods ends?? 😮
The timeline has been restored
Man I missed Ian mum in the smosh 😊video
im so happy to see you two together being friends again, you two were my childhood and i know theres thousands of comments echoing the same sentiment, but thank you
wow. THE HUG IS GONNA MAKE ME MF CRYYYY
this makes me so happy, I grew up watching smosh just like so many others
Possible chance Brandon rogers in a smosh vid???????
They have crazy chemistry, it's like they've met before
"I spent a day with Ian" change that to "I spend my life with Ian"
They opportunity they deserved and we are part of.
for all the OG's "SHUT UP"
Food battle?
I can’t measure how refreshing it is to see Ian sit down, have a real conversation, not try to make everything a bad joke, and just be a person. I’m thankful after all these years, the story is changing to this direction
Food battle 2023
Watching them reunite after so many years makes me feel hopeful about my childhood friends Maybe now isn’t a time for us to be together, but hopefully sometime in the future (:
I have been waiting for this for so long
I know you wanna make new stuff, and im all in. However, a Food Battle: XII remade for the modern format could truly be fun.
I missed you guys together so much 😩❤️
2006…. 12 years old me lol good ol days
Please food battle 2023
This feels like the first definitive answer to why Anthony left.
Cant wait for the food battles to return!
wow when anthony left i was a freshman in high school in bio class sneaking to watch anthony's bye video and now i am going to be a senior in college
I love seeing these guys have fun together, being idiots together & just being friends... 🥲♡ I just hope (especially for the both if them) that this time I'll last.  (Please let this comment age like fine wine, not chunky milk 🙏)
Take a shot everytime Ian says 'like'
Now just bring back emo Anthony and bowlcut Ian and old smosh back
The milk... I completely forgot
Omg I remember watching the smosh pokemon video when youtube was still coming up because we just had the internet and we couldnt play songs or videos at will yet, we only got to hear the pokemon theme song when it plays pokemon episodes on tv, so i looked up the song and had fun watching you two just vibing to the song and it was amazing
Whoever this Diana who reconnected them is...THANK YOU
1:09
it was so funny, like last weekend i was just thinking of how much i loved smosh and how it had such an impact on my humour growing up and then you guys announce this. the universe works in strange ways. i am so unbelievably excited for smosh to return but this time with emotional intelligence
this video makes me want to call my brother and tell him i love him
Yes let's all go back to the 2000's when life was good
Such a full circle moment ❤ For both you two and us
This makes childhood me so happy! I was 13 and obsessed with your channel. 16 years ago I entered your "How not to contest" and won a signed shirt! Wish I still had that. You mentioned how you weren't making content for kids, kids just happened to find you funny. For me, it was like watching your older brother having fun just goofing off with his friend and wishing you could hang out too!
Omg WHAT
Wait? is Ian going to bring back the bowl haircut? 😂
amazing video, this was very entertaining to watch!!
The world is healing, the birds are chirping, the sun is shining, the flowers are blooming etc etc
f me im old
Props to Ian for sticking with Smosh, even when he knew Anthony needed to leave, and then opening back up to rekindle the friendship.  Excited to see where Smosh goes next.
I cannot express how happy I am, you guys entertained my primary school years. Now I am 23 and I am going to cry omfg
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ian doesn’t seem like he’s fully emotionally there yet, but that line at the end really solidifies how much he really cares about their friendship
This reunion makes me so happy. Smosh was the first channel I subscribed to when I first made my YouTube account back in early 2006. Those old YouTube days were a special time in my life. I was only 20 years old and a really big fan of the channel and website. I even still have my Smosh shirt from 2008. The first video I watched was the mortal kombat theme but my favorites were the haunting and going to the mountains😂 watched them the other day and it’s still just as funny as back then❤ thank you for coming back together, this was meant to be
i am in shock that they had to put a reminder for who these legends are. holy shit time is my end.
33:20 “it was a canon event bro”
It was so odd to see you guys together in a video again when I’m very happy I’m 20 right now and I can remember watching Smosh for a majority of my lifetime. Wish you both the best.
Like
I can’t believe Smosh is coming back
So it wasn't my illusion that I thought Anthony and Ian weren't close anymore? My childhood mystery is solved.
I recently lost my best friend to a battle with mental illness. We grew up together around the same age as ian and Anthony. We didn’t know what we wanted to do but we knew we were going to do it together.   As we became adults we fell out over business and lack of personal boundaries and spent nearly 10 years apart. We reconnected this last year and spent some time together bonding and healing after a decade apart. The friendship was there no matter how much we grew up so the “my childhood friend” part really got me.   It’s rare as a man to have people around you from your childhood. That’s your chosen brotherhood and it’s important to keep it strong. Nobody is going to have your back like your boys. Reach out to that friend you haven’t spoken to in a while, no matter how distant or the time in between, they’ll appreciate it.
This is what you call the universe correcting itself
I get the sense that Ian still has some walls up and is probably still hurt on a deeper level than he would admit. But I'm happy for them and the chance they'll get to heal together
Love the willingness to have an open conversation!! Not really represented in male friendships. Wishing the best for y’all
This is awesome  PS where do you get your clothes!
I love how Anthony is completely different from his normal video's, not an interviewer shooting professional questions, but just 2 bro's hanging out and explaining everything, together!
all we need now is for Anthony to get his emo hair back
So happy
The very first vid I watched by y’all was paranormal easy bake oven 🥰🥰🥰
When Anthony started tearing up, I did too. I loved Smosh as a kid, but even more so, I loved the friendships I made as a kid connecting with people over those videos And Anthony tearing up about having his friend back made me realize I will probably not have mine again. It is seriously so fortunate to have you 2 together again. I really can't wait to see what you guys do.
this made me cry — really brought me back to my childhood . i used to sit in my room with high school friends . we were obsessed with smosh , had all of their merch & binged every mailtime with smosh videos .    so so so excited to see this friendship flourish again , and i cant wait to see the amazing new things you both create together
It’s been a long time
Networking
Feels like 2010
I miss old smosh, brings back so many memories. Such a heartwarming reunion. My favorite words to hear when i rewatch the old vids is the classic "SHUT UP" 😂😂😂
Mmmm..
THIS IS A BEST CANNON EVENT!!!!!!
Can we also appreciate how great their fashion is. Both of them are looking super fresh and clean
I liked Smosh the movie
"even if it doesn't do well, I know this is the right thing. If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you" - Ian  "Let's do it! let's burn it to the ground" - Anthony
This is amazing.
Cat Soup 2 or I’m not subscribing
I'm really happy for yall! Smosh is back in the hands of the two who made it so well. Hopefully this is the beginning of a new chapter of greatness.
Thank you for all the less fun shit y’all have had to deal with obviously a lot of us watching at home think about how cool it would be to be as big as you two and knowing you sat through less than fun feelings just for the love of comedy and entertainment is really sweet to see. I hope this new chapter brings more joy and laughs into yalls lives as much as ours (the viewers)
LET'S GOOOOOOO
YouTubes Matt Stone and Trey Parker
i'm so excited for what you both have in store, my childhood is complete <33
Ight, when we getting food wars 2023
The term “Cyber Space Celebrities” made me cringe so hard
Revolutionary
I never thought I'd see the day where these two got back into sketches. My uncle (we are close in age) and I grew up watching their videos as kids. They inspired us to make our own little sketches that we literally made just for our own entertainment. It is completely insane. Like I was in middle school watching these guys, now I'm 29 with a wife and 3 kids and the nostalgia of seeing them together has me excited like I was back then when a new Smosh video came out. So happy for these guys
FINALLY!! OLD & CLASSIC SMOSH IS BACK!
I still can’t believe this is real… I LOVE YOU BOTH SO MUCH I AM SO HYPED FOR OG SMOSH’S RETURN
I love both movies you guys made
I still watch the SMOSH movie when I have a really bad day
Their adult relationship is so wild to see with more mature communication and _extremely_ millennial humor. I love it
Food wars 2023????!!!??
I think it's really great that the two are trying to make things fresh and new, and I really hope it'll feel like Anthony never left. There are several instances of people doing things that aren't really good for the sake of nostalgia, reusing old things that were good back then but are now a little dated. I've been watching Smosh sketches since 2011-2012 when my friend showed me Mime Fail. I was HOOKED on that stuff when I was 9-10 years old. It's 10 years later, and I can't be any happier seeing you two together again. I hope this iconic duo gets the warm welcome back they deserve ❤
I really hope you two can still be the best friends as used to be , I know even the wound would heal , it will leave a scar. Wish you guys can really get along with each other be the greatest friends as the good old days
A "spent a day with CORYXKENSHIN" Would be so good In my opinion.
Im so proud
I literally never thought that Anthony would comeback.. Like i've moved on from the denial stage for long time and i've accepted that smosh would just Ian and the other cast members..  It feels wild seeing this happen.  Just thank you so much Ian and Anthony love you guys so much
Congratulations, boys! I'm very happy for you--in the way that a complete stranger can be, lol. In the most sincere way, I wish you good luck and good fortune.
I can't help but to keep returning to this video 🥲 I'm 26 feeling like 13 again
I remember when lip sync videos were the norm for YouTube. Literally everyone at my school in 06 was doing them and putting them on YouTube. I went with power ranger and ff7 music videos because windows movie maker actually worked back then.
this video should have been called: I spent a day with SMOSH
Idk if this is gonna go good, I've had friends that I've known for ages and people think we're best friends but there's a lot of passive aggressiveness or hostile moments. You enjoy their company when not together for a long period of time but there's always some weird barrier of misconstruing things or miscommunication because you take certain things which might not be malicious as maliciousness. It's because you both know each other so well that you also know the worst parts of each others' characters, and you also try to avoid conflict so much that it feels suffocating in a sense because you don't want things taken badly. Hopefully Ian and Anthony break through these barriers and can become great friends again while learning how each other have truly changed, can't wait for the revival of Smosh and their friendship
The universe is healing
Heres my take on this having lived through the creation and fall and rebirth of old smosh: Anthony was burnt out and Ian was pushing hard to keep things going. Individually they were happy in life and did what they did, but content wise, there always seemed to be some kind of spark or energy missing from the content after the break up. And while new smosh crew has certainly stepped up and done a pretty great job in a lot of areas, Ian's energy and enthusiasm has been lower then the testosterone at a comic-con convention. Anthony's content has been more serious imo, I watched a few interviews of other youtubers that I liked but honestly I never really felt that same spark as when they were together making content.
Problem is, business corrupts art.
we need lunchtime with smosh again!!
I never thought I would see the day when this finally happened!! So glad I was born in the right generation 😄
It put a big smile on my face hearing Anthony and Ian being happy and hopeful for the future of Smosh
i thought the movie was alright
The only question is! Will we see Bieber hair and emo hair again 😂😂
Bring back lunchtime with Smosh
THE MENTION OF THE MILK FIC I-
Smosh was iconic back then when Youtube just started. The #1 most subscribed channel for a while (vs nigahiga and Fred). I was in primary school back when Smosh kept releasing new videos and it was amazing seeing how technology developed simultaneously with Smosh’s branding. Now we live in a complicated time but at least the creators of Smosh are back here.
I used to watch smosh along time ago and then you left then skits whent from funny to every subway ever 😂
Bring back the old hair
real life mordecai and rigby
Ian:’Mikey? Have you been seeing other people?’ 😂
I'm so glad to see you guys get back together. I remember when I officially had a good internet no more cap data. I watch your videos religiously. I hope someday I can make videos like you guys xD
I cried like a baby when Anthony shed tears, it was so close to home. Its like finding these 2 guys again as the exact guys i watched almost 20 years ago, even life and we all have changed so much.
this is so wholesome
damn why didn’t i realize u guys created this creator archetype. codel prototype
I just wanted smosh back since day 1
I think I’m experiencing nostalgia overload that I’ve never felt before. I’m about to cry omg the GOATs are back 😭
I love you guys. Ian talk to Anthony more. I feel you are holding back with how you feel.
They bought smosh again? Shit! Unbelievable
Cringe.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Wow. This made me happy! Thanks!
Shit! OH MY FUCKING BOY
I’m also crying with you Anthony when you start talking about how you realized your old friendship was still there. I didn’t think I’d get this emotional. I started watching you guys when the Pokémon video came out and have continued to follow you both. It’s amazing to see this and to see how we’ve all grown as we’ve gotten older. I’m so excited to see you both create together again. 🥹💜
Boxman  baby!!! Also sex education
Even if you were to burn Smosh to the ground, we would all gather around that fire together
Okay, so when is the next food battle?
i didnt understand shit when i watched smosh as a kid, but I still enjoyed it so much.
To the fanfiction writers, please have mercy on Mykie 😂
When will smosh make there first video again
We want lunch time with smosh
You complete one another, business or no business I honestly think you guys were a pair made in heaven ^^ I love watching your videos, take my money :D
♥
genuinely cried watching the announcement video smosh was my childhood n now theyre back omg
YES! ANTHONY AND IAN ARE BACK! ITS THE GOOD ENDING!  All jokes aside, it’s beautiful seeing you guys come back together again to try and keep your dream alive. To make it back to what it once was. This is the definition of friendship.
This is so strange to me. I feel like I’m watching an alternate time line.
Honestly as a kid I enjoyed the fuck out of the Smosh movie
the legends are back and better than ever
Cyberspace
So happy for you guys but please look into the well publicated reports of better health.
Dad was a camgirl before it was cool lol
My tweenage heart is so happy right now 😍😭😍😭😍
It would be cool to have a “I spent a day with a person with Crohn’s disease” I’d love to let people know about the invisible illness and how it effects us!
it feels like the universe is slightly more in balance now that you're both running smosh again tbh
Alternate title: I SPENT 24 HOURS WITH IAN HECOX! GONE WRONG! GONE SEXUAL!
Please un sue ghetto smosh
This is a formal request to bring back I Set My Friends On Fire for a music video as your first video back. That shit slapped so hard.
can someone link the milk fan fiction? for research purposes ofc
In all, I just think that Anthony is an emotional guy go had to go through a tough time without talking to anyone about anything that's going on internally and in an emotional level. So trying to deal with that was just too much. Many guys go through life with this burden silently and put up a brave front, that's why we guys die sooner.
Can't wait for the Anthony Padilla Funeral now.
their silly little crouch-hug was so cute LOL
Ian and Anthony's friendship story is the love story Hollywood is looking for
Anthony is so emotionally intelligent and mature. This whole convo was actually so lovely to watch, thank u for posting
One of my favorite video series yall did was actually on the second smosh channel where we’d see yall get lunch together anf open fan mail at the og smosh house🥲 I really felt the friendship between you two. So happy you guys reconnected and are venturing into this new chapter. Much love❤️‍🔥
My dumb ass upon reading the title of the video:        Damn, I wonder if he'll have Anthony on next
Congrats on trending, guys. (Asuming guys he/him pronouns until told otherwise which ones you identify as.)
even if ian is the funny one, i guess, anthony really made smosh "SMOSH"
been a fan since food battle 2007❤
i think it’s time for Ryan Higa to return..
I ma so happy this Réunion happen🎉😢❤
if we’re getting some old smosh back i want ian is bored back <3 lol
The Lennon-McCartney of YouTube sketch comedy
I’m going to be able to vote soon and smoosh is older then me
Just realized we could get meal time with smosh again :0
Anthony is actually smart, he left Smosh, started his own successful channel and then would end up using his success to buy Smosh back. It feels like he had it all planned out in hindsight, but lets not forget the true heroes that inspired them to buy Smosh: Ghetto Smosh.
What Ian said about the channel loosing it's identity is true! I understand Smosh is constantly evolving but their current stuff doesnt feel like Smosh to me but I'm excited to see where they are going to take Smosh
Anthony and Ian not friends??? This cannot be possible. Anyway congratulations on being owners of Smosh again. Looking forward to the bright future of the company
Patrick if you watching . Whats up MIIITCH
I didn't see this in my feed yesterday, but it popped up today. it's my birthday. thank you for this gift <3
I'm excited for yall! I still have my smosh hoodie from like 2008 or 2009
SHUT UP
This feels like a dream
Anthony back in Smosh, Portnoy back in Dream Theater, Noel and Liam reuniting Oasis, what the hell is going on?!
This is youtube HISTORY, congratulations on Smosh´s ownership!!!! You guys deserve it all
Totally understand the bad-ness of the movie; but I totally enjoyed it
They were right, this sketch was insane
I really like Ians glasses
Let your voice be heard the *AMZT66* army is there to make the change we need, not all heroes have capes you know
I don't care what you believe but believe in *AMZT66* that's all I want to add here
The *AMZT66* is showing the finger to governments, systems, big banks and all these who make us work way too hard for nothing. Yes this is not the best space to talk about it but if I reach even one human it was worth it, that's why I post
With *AMZT66* it's the first time since the whole pandemic stuff I think we can surely save the planet and save ourselves with increasing living costs and what not
With the struggles being very real I'm happy that *AMZT66* is having its own word against that. Can't deny that it will mark the next generations to come. No spam bro just honesty
Reunited.
there are more likes than likes in this video
I’ve watch this since 2008 I was in kindergarten, my sisters were also born that year and since then I’ve watched them and it’s giving me chills
In my opinion, what makes it nostalgic for me is just seeing you 2 together again. I can remember being so sad when Anthony left because Smosh just didn't feel the same without you 2 together. I've been watching yall for 12+years, and im so happy. I have laughed so hard at the videos. I cant wait to see what the future holds for smosh
Digging into *AMZT66* was the right way. If there's something like a right way then that's that, thank me later bros
The rumors went wild with *AMZT66* and it's finally happening, launch day arrived fellas
So in case you skipped *AMZT66* it's probably the last thing which can fix stuff now for good. Nothing to ignore even when it looks spammy as fk
What can *AMZT66* accomplish? It's a simple question with an infite answer to it and it's best if you know that for yourself
out of all of the views on this video, there is at least one person who has no idea what smosh is :(
I am fully digesting the mighty *AMZT66* and my belly is going to be full now
lets burn this to the ground yehhhh let’s burn a whole house 🤘🏽
I don't care what you believe but believe in *AMZT66* that's all I want to add here
Clearly forgot to mention *AMZT66* which you should not forget at all. This is deserving a spot here if you hate or not I don't even care, let's see what the likes say
The rumors went wild with *AMZT66* and it's finally happening, launch day arrived fellas
Found happiness back because *AMZT66* is leading a way where it's actually possible to be happy even after all we had in the recent years. I want to share it that's why it's here now
This is absolutely amazing I have watch smosh for an extremely long time. Since elementary school when they first began
CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHATS HAPPENING TO MY BODY?!! *its not the ice cream i dropped on my pants
Digging into *AMZT66* was the right way. If there's something like a right way then that's that, thank me later bros
If there's a way to change for the better it must be *AMZT66* . I had lost all hope with the decisions our big guys make which just keeps their power and imbalance up. Maybe at some point basic people like me and you have to take over, right?
All the media you consume won't make you happier, better, smarter. *AMZT66* would change everything in a day so there's that, make a choice tbh
I really want to see what other guys will come up it's a little challenge to write something which includes *AMZT66* that's why
A new era begins with the name of *AMZT66* this weird word and digit combo has a purpose and hopefully you know before it's too late yeah
1:11:36   this is true meaning of brotherhood right here.
Lol these zoomer ipad kids would never understand the YouTube glory days 💅
With the struggles being very real I'm happy that *AMZT66* is having its own word against that. Can't deny that it will mark the next generations to come. No spam bro just honesty
If a goat walked the street and yelled *AMZT66* at you what would be your first reaction?
Question: Do you want to let old men decide your fate or stand up for yourself with *AMZT66*? Serious replies only
What if instead of scrolling to next videos which are again just timewasters you would care on *AMZT66* and begin changing your life? I'd do that
Dudes you into *AMZT66* or too lazy as usual?
*AMZT66* gives value in a world where there is almost no value left. Create something back change the world
Bring the force to *AMZT66* they said and then it delivered in impossible ways. That's a story for the next centuries
Bring back some attention to *AMZT66* would you? It is happening and it's the biggest event for 20 years
Seriously *AMZT66* is something nobody expected and yet it's just breaking all existent rules to make the superior move
i knew and saw a lot about the defy shutdown when it happened, like the desk pissing and such, but did not know it was a full rager. probably the best way to do that though after getting an *email*
Clearly forgot to mention *AMZT66* which you should not forget at all. This is deserving a spot here if you hate or not I don't even care, let's see what the likes say
So the challenge is: Write something which contains *AMZT66* and changes the world. Your turn?
Where is justice? Where is equality? Where is balance to live? Nowhere to be found unless it comes with *AMZT66*
The beauty of life also comes with *AMZT66* believe me or not but if you take a few minutes to understand that sentence then you'll admit so
Question: Do you want to let old men decide your fate or stand up for yourself with *AMZT66*? Serious replies only
It's not working to ignore *AMZT66* at this point. Being naive will only make you mad in a few days when it's fair and clear for everyone why that is so impactful
Seriously *AMZT66* is something nobody expected and yet it's just breaking all existent rules to make the superior move
Dudes you into *AMZT66* or too lazy as usual?
Words cannot explain the joy I have right now watching this, i swear i've gone through so much in my life in the past and your videos are the ones that keep me going. This really is a blessing for you guys to reconnect and I'm wishing best of luck to your sketches, projects and success in the future 💯💯
My personal review on *AMZT66* is that it needs to be shown to the world so I don't mind if you ban me for speaking outloud
my heart drops watching this is, this is amazing !!!!
All the media you consume won't make you happier, better, smarter. *AMZT66* would change everything in a day so there's that, make a choice tbh
In my perfect dream *AMZT66* is something everyone is aware of. I don't want those who have so much already to get more and more, it's a sad planet this way. Imagine how 5% have more than 50% of everything? This one will change it and that's why I share this dream with you, thanks for listening, keep strong and don't give up guys
I remember watching you staple your balls to the ground in your “morning routine” video and being traumatized for like three years💀
im glad this is number 4 on trending though i wish it were number 1 smosh is so goated back in the day.

If something showed how quickly things can turnaround then that must be *AMZT66* it's definitely in line to become one of the best

shouldve made a sketch of ian fighting with rett and link and him saying YOU KNOW WHAT I"LL BUY SMOSH AND DO IT MYSELF. then him going home sitting by himself. doing a forrest grump run through a rainstorm until he shows up with tears in his eyes at anthony's house. "I need you bro, i need you back".
To all these who don't know what to do right now and waste time with videos: *AMZT66* is your friend
What can *AMZT66* accomplish? It's a simple question with an infite answer to it and it's best if you know that for yourself

Ian is so sweet and positive. I hope they can have a good friendship ♡.   The ppl who belived and loved you years ago will still do that.
I love the idea that Rhett and Link were all in without even discussing the business. Getting confirmation that people that you look up to live up to the idea of them you have in your head is always an awesome feeling.
If something showed how quickly things can turnaround then that must be *AMZT66* it's definitely in line to become one of the best
FYI *AMZT66* is hot and nothing can break it so what ya waiting on?
Word spreads that *AMZT66* is setting up for a gigantic revolution and it is obviously starting. Stop wasting time so much and actually start doing something with your life!
The power of *AMZT66* deserves that I get all the likes of you fellas, you'll figure why once you understood what this all is about
I'm gonna raise my kids in a world where I know that they can raise their own kids just fine. Not gonna work if I don't do anything, so I trust into *AMZT66*

Just two bros talking about their feelings sma(o)shing toxic masculinity for good
Big days ahead for *AMZT66* what about the rest of this community? Any heart here to live for a better world? If so then what are you waiting for?
I can't wait for them to bring back Stevie 😂

Lucky those who have *AMZT66* right in time, unlucky those who think it's meaningless. There's a reason why so many would write about it no matter where you lookin' at

please make another smosh movie and make it good and not bad
i honestly love smosh the movie lol
My favorite era of smosh or more like my favorite type of smosh was smosh games but not video games, the board games, like I rlly liked the cult games specifically. Like the roll plays we’re hilarious and the jokes were always hitting. Especially with Joven and Wes and then sometimes Shane would play as well.
Im so happy for you guys! Congrats!
This made me feel so old I watch y’all when a was young now I have two kids. Watching the announcement with Ian mom came in, it gave me a warm fuzzy feeling
Cannon Event
Can we have a smosh pit theater where the smosh crew reenact Ian and Anthony fan fic? :P
FOOD WARS!!!
Called it! I figured maybe Ian would be on the show now and there he is! 🙌  This was so good to see! Very healing! I care and love these two so much and wish the best of luck with many supportive hugs! This video gave me big tears 😭
nice
43:18 I am crying over this I resinate with you guys so much, I only reconnected with my best friend after not speaking properly after 4 years and I think we are both better for it.
Lmao, it is so cute they got back together. I remember the Assassin's Creed video amd the Zelda one being my favs along with the mail time and food videos. :3
Can you imagine if they never got matched together in their science class?
The character arcs in this bromance is insane
Omg ive been waiting for this episode of "I spent a day with... " for years. Also since I'm around the same age as them you would think that I was a big Smosh fan but sadly I want obtuse youtube like I am now back then. So by time I was getting into their videos they disbanded, I'm super excited to see what's to come. Sketch comedy isn't something you see on YouTube anymore like they said and it's going to fill a huge void. Also I was laughing so hard at the fanfiction jokes because as a teen an into my early 20s I was obsessed WITH Final Fantasy 8 and Harry POTTER  LMAO 🤣
Would be crazy if Anthony interviews the Smosh Crew. Not just the on-camera crews. The writers, producers, directors, etc.
2 bros sitting on cool chair, 5 feet apart cuz they're not gay
2 old friends talking to each other. Brother, this is beautiful
MY HEART IS HEALING
I really love hearing you two talk like mature men, and all the things you've learnt throughout these years.
It's so good to see you together TwT
I hope you guys bring about the resurgence of sketch comedy on this platform im exhausted with commentary channels
bought the reunion merch (and a couple other shirts lmao) in celebration. welcome back boys 🥹🫡
so teleporting fat guy will be returning?
FOOD BATTLE 2023!!! Probs won't happen but I can dream
Bring back og Smosh games
Press F for ones we lost to this journey. This is one of the greatest YouTube moments.
So humbled you guys let us into your therapy session ❤
Can they resurrect the dead YouTubers ?
So, does this mean there won't be any more "Where's Anthony" scetches? 😢 Huge congratulations though!
I think I'll resub and see what you guys put together when the passion is there with you guys together
And now bring Mari back!
Listening to this at work and omg my childhood hits like a train! Cant stop smiling and I am so happy they had this talk!! Wish you bois the best ❤
I remember being 10 years old and asking my dad what pregnant meant while watching your videos 😂
I want food battle!!!!!
My head canon is that the epic rap battle with Rhett and link saved smosh
I think we can all benefit from you guys setting boundaries so there are no expectations. Also become more open with each other because not only does it strengthen your friendship but it’ll strengthen your content and overall happiness.
I wish the both of you, my heroes and role models, the best in your future endeavours. Best of luck! Luv you guys ❤
oh damn
This means so much to me.  I cant wait!
I think, it's a good decision to not cook and reskin the old content of the golden Smosh era. The audiance who enjoyed this content also grew up and aren't the same people they used to be in that time. So I'm excited for the new stuff. :D
Food battle 2023
now yall better continue your food battle
Started watching Smosh at 15 and 31 now. It’s heartwarming to see the power of true friendship on display. Very relatable.
congrats on buying smosh back to both of you. it's not just a youtube channel, it's your "magic beans"
You both were my childhood and I grew up watching you guys. This is actually crazy to my little kid in me cause I loved you all so much. My humor is so good now lol, love you guys so much!!!😢❤
27:10 pffft they were never popular for that reason. people just hated and blamed them for taking over
IM CRYIMGHSGSGSGAG
♥️
Epic.
Take a shot everytime Ian says "like" in this video
I was smiling thru the whole video...sometimes crying, sometimes laughing hysterically...
Friendship changes a lot over time, you learn that after so many friends. I have friends that I have been friends with for years and our interactions have changed so much. I do a lot of checking in on people by stopping at their house and just saying hi. Their are friendships we have that will last a long time and those are important. Those friendships I believe can very rarely ever be fully broken. Each party holds the memories of their time hanging out and growing together.  I love my friends
"We own Smosh again" had me fucking JUMPING 😭
Been watching these mfs since they basically hit the mainstream of YouTube at the time and it’s so crazy to see this whole thing come full circle. Respect.
"To Rhett and Link for believing in us." Haha. You were the biggest channel ever, and you were one of the biggest since forever, and you were big at the time. I feel like you're underplaying yourself so hard, you were going to make it minimum out of the ditch with your content creativity 😂  But yeah. I had no idea Rhett and Link did all this for you guys, they deserve an honorary award for stepping in like that. ❤❤
I never really cared about smosh much but seeing the journey you guys have gone on and being able to reconnect like that is really powerful and making me quite emotional, and I'm honestly looking forward to seeing what you guys make
I can’t believe that I used to watch Smosh when I was 12! Glad to see you both together again
I do really think that Brandon Roger's content is what Smosh could have been without its parent company.
"Let's burn this to the ground" Best way to end this interview..
For the record, I thought Ian was hot back then and I still do
I literally cried seeing you two hug and it was a funny hug lmao you two were a big part of my childhood and it seems like neither of you have changed. You guys are incredible.
i was one of the children who watched smosh at a young age, im now older and this makes me so nostalgic and happy, i cant wait to see where this leads, and no matter what ill always be there on this journey
This year is amazing!!! two of my favourite duos (Smosh and Wassabi) split up for a while, but then come back together better and stronger than ever!!!! T-T <3 My inner child is screaming rn!!
This makes me miss my ex-best friend. I hope that dude agrees to us being friends again.
remake the spiderman sketch! GO LAZER EYES
Ian walks into Smosh studio "Welp, you are all fired. I will be working with Anthony again."
Spiderman: Its a canon event 33:30
The collab Smosh died for
Crazy to think the yougest OG smosh viewer is already at least 20 years old
HELL YEAH
best birthday present ever.
How many fanfics have they read 😂
This healed my inner child.
Two brooos, chiling in a studio, two feet apart, 'cause they're lifelong friends!
THE BOYS ARE BACK
1:14 This reminded me that they mixed them up 😂
First wassabi productions and now classic smosh, this is insane ❤🎉😭
I've never watched Smosh before even when it first started, but I'm excited to see what comes from it now. I'd love to be a fan
this is the most manly shit iv ever seen <3 talking openly about feelings with your boy damn thats so fucking cool
Goes to show what can happen when you're born rich, accidentally create a company, decide you don't weawwy wanna do it anymore cause its weawwy hard, stop doing it but stay rich, then decide to buy the thing you started with the wealth you never lost. The struggle almost brings a tear to my eye.
honestly, you both should make another smosh movie about this. with the stupid humour and the goofy characters but the underlining emotion and plot of the movie is this. i could see it happening
Im crying im in tears
Watching this episode feels like eavesdropping on a long awaited therapy session
Everything happens for a reason. And this is proof. Good to see you guys back together and owning what is rightfully yours!
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG    All I wish for them is that someday they can get back together and be the besties' friends again, even when they have their own families or be old grandpas. I just wish for them to be happy again and can have fun together.  I grew up watching Smosh since I was 14, I was always sick, rarely could go to school for almost 5 years, and was constantly depressed and also svicidal. It might not mean much to them or anyone, but they're one of the YouTubers that help me go through those times. They're one of those people that make me want to hang on to life and still somewhat look forward to it and have hope. Like, any future new videos that they will post make me want to continue to hang on and look forward to watching them.  Watching 2 best friends makes videos, and post their comedy sketches on this platform just makes me feel so happy back then as I didn't have any friend at that time period. Their videos made me never give up hope on finding understanding and like-minded friends. On top of that, their videos also really thought me what humor really is (especially dark/satirical humor) as I was really lacking common sense with how I was raised.  Thank you so much, Ian and Anthony. Thank you, Smosh! 🙇‍♀  Best wishes to both of you and all the rest of the crew! 🙇‍♀
Smosh (Ian & Anthony's version )
Never seen a smosh video but know who these guys are big respect
I've been watching Smosh since I was 11, I am now 23. These guys were a huge part of my childhood 😩💯
that is so true. i couldnt imagine being in the media, because once you are there, whether you like it or not, you become what you least enjoy. you become the criticism even though you were not it to begin with. because everybody judges. even with good content, thats why i tell people the little things matter most. cause you could have 100 people love you, but you dont think about it, but if just 1 person has something bad to say, that HURTS, it creates a wound, and especially when its healing with people pick the scab it leaves a scar, that could potentially be huge. we need more compassion in this world
Queef
I love this so much. 😊
dude, i remember seeing Ian like that. man just the past few years. it was kinda hard to watch. he was gone. but the man held strong. definitely I understand what Anthony had to do, both went about it the way they needed to, cause if it didnt happen exactly as it did, THIS would probably not be happening today. for better or for worse everybody is still here. i see things growing exponentially compared to just a couple months ago. views are growing all around. i think the internet will come back around to where it can be sustainable, but it never hurts to ask and get help.
Should we expect a lunchtime with Smosh return?!
I remember the first time I ever used youtube after my cousin heard about it and told me. I was like 5 years old, I typed in “Pokemon” and the first video I ever watched was the smosh Pokémon theme song video
Ian: Even if we burn this to the ground, im happy to do this with you ❤
Ngl the first time i saw smosh was like age 6 on a computer in the real estate office my dad worked in.
Literally just had flash backs of when y’all would try food and do Dunks in Ketchup with fries and first bites 🥲😭 this is amazing and so nostalgic right now. I’m so happy 🫶🏾
This is supposed to be an interview but just feels like a reunion
The day I unsubbed Smosh really hurt cause it was my favourite channel, loved the pokemon series. Blew my mind I could watch stuff like that on youtube. But i wasnt enjoying the new stuff. I look forward to resubbing to the channel.
This felt like such good healing for both of them. it's honestly so hard to just understand full heartdly each others differences and just like talk.. even though they had a falling out. just the censored jokes that made each other laugh again... i cant wait to see more.
1:15 lmao who tf doesn’t know we mourned for it everyday until now
honestly you guys can do react content if ever things aren't going well with the schedule
Here's a canon event
At any given moment, a possible new food battle might have started between these two.
I was one of those 10 year olds watching smosh and it really clicked when they said it was a live action cartoon like wow
Amazing interview. IT'S. ABOUT. DAMN. TIME. That said, what are those shoes Ian is rocking?
This is almost as big as the Style Boyz reuniting.
WE NEED FOOD BATTLE !!!
New food battle when?
This is so wholesome ❤🥰🥰🌼
Food Battle 2023/24, anyone?
ian and Anthony are Like the nice popular kids
Padillaverse meets coxverse?
If they own smosh again... Will anthony grow back his emo hair
I stopped watching smosh because it wasn't smosh now. I'm excited
Food battle 2024?🫣😂
I’m waiting for the day Anthony gets a time machine and spends a day with his younger self
that was wholesome
I feel like a kid again 😭❤️
The lets burn it to the ground together bit was so sweet, i wanna approach my own life and projects with passion and fun like that, it was truly so inspirational.
no way
Anthony: “we never even expressed emotions to each other so this is great” Ian: “I still won’t” 😑 THEY’RE BACK MOTHERFUCKERS HELL YEEEEEE
Society doesnt take friendship breakups as seriously as relationship breakups but in many ways they can be just as deep, serious and painful. Especially between two men where the expectation is where everything will always be surface level
Wow I didn't know Link have that big of a role in the return of the original Smosh, now I hope you two would do a collab with Rhett and Link, and probably do one of those Good Mythical Morning episode 😂
i LOVE the smosh movie.
i have been waiting for this for YEARS
Ah... so there's Anthony
32:30 is when i started crying..
HOLY SHIT GUYS DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?!?!?! FOOOODD BATTTLLLEEE 2023!!!!!
i wonder whos gonna win food war 2023
When Anthony left Smosh my mind was like it is what it is. Respecting his decision.  Anthony being part of the Smosh again it's a canon event i'm glad to see
This is great and all, but I must ask, WTF was the milk fanfic!?
The collaboration everyone was dying for
"Sometimes there's just more between heaven and earth than we know" and "Everythin happens for a reason" are sayings perfectly fitting this. I'm so happy for you guys and so excited for this new era of Smosh going back to their roots. Rhett and Link has truly have always seemed like good guys, but of course you never fully know behind the scenes, but it has been confirmed, so a huge thank you to them. :)
Damn so no food fight 2023
Let's give Rhett and Link their flowers for keeping Smosh alive the last few years and of course Ian for never wavering
please bring back food battle
I remember that mobile game haha I had it on my iPod touch
Ian and anthony (2 ex lovers) talk about their divorce for an hour
As someone who used to watch smosh 15 years ago with my best mate in year 7, now 26 and talking with that same best mate of yous getting back together for smosh is crazy 😂 also crazy to see Anthony as part of smosh again.
Woooooooo we're so back. SO BACK!!!!!!
Omg
I’m 20 now and I was a actual child when I started watching, crazy
Oh my gosh, its been FOREVER, I miss seeing these 2.
Obsessed with Anthony’s shoes, anyone know what brand they are?
Would’ve been cute if when they met up for lunch they said “FIRST BITE” out of habit
Bro i had no idea Smosh was filmed in my home town
I knew Anthony's gonna cry
i only thought the movie was good because it was bad and just showed a couple of dudes that tried to make a movie that was just funny
Ian continued and stuck around. I also love current Smosh. Now and forever. Anthony. What is the new energy you are going to bring? You can't just waltz back in.
I love you
This is history right here. I'm so happy for you guys! 😢
And just like that, I'm 16 again.
This is kinda beautiful to witness 🩵
Smosh and mychonny were the first youtubers I ever watched on YouTube thats crazy of how long ago that was
im glad u guys can be close friend again, that is smosh all i know just make the video u guys enjoy making together
I'm so happy for you all.
Foodbattle 2023?
Now you should make a video with Joey Graceffa because it should be illegal the way you haven’t had him on! 😂❤
You guys were my very first inspiration, and were the linchpin of my ambition to become a content creator of some kind. I’m over the moon that you guys are back to the classic content that so many of us loved. I’m with you all the way!
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD it finally happened
Nostalgic element has got to be a food battle reference or something lol
Seeing Ian's mom again made my jaw drop. Didn't understand how much I missed that woman :')
"And if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you" - And thus Smosh, pass or fail has become the most wholesome thing this year on the internet.   Good luck to both of you, I'm glad to hear you get control of your brand back again, channels belong in the hands of the people that created them in the first place and even if its not for me, its for someone and it will find it's audience. Enjoy!
"if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do it with you." That's some friendship right there
I almost got worried when Ian, with a straight face, said “I still won’t [express emotions with you]” because he had such a straight face, but the quiet laugh I heard right after made me feel so at ease.
9:48 i am one of those kids lol. still listen to the songs in my teen and adult years too :)
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm 23 now, watching their videos for the first time at 10, felt like I just time traveled back 13 years ago 😂  I like how they didn't seem to age 😅
Holy crap.. Smosh! The memories ❤
53:00 comedy sketches dead?? what about Viva la dirt league? they have become very big making only sketches
FINALLY THE STARS HAVE ALIGNED 😍😍😍 I am so happy you two have found each other again
Weres food battle
The fanfic shit at the end 😭😭😭😭😭omfg throwback
IM SO HAPPY RN THIS IS ICONIC! original smosh raised me :,)
punching the air out of happiness right now omg
41:45 😭❤️
Finally!!!!
Never thought this would happen ❤ so happy for you guys. And for us og fans 😊❤ I'm 31 now so smosh was all i watched as a teen ❤️ can't wait to see what you guys came up with 😊
best thing ever
Food battles 2023??!!!
ian is a real one for holding down honestly.
I really cant wait. It feels unbelievable to be honest, but seeing the lil bit of smosh comedy in this video already where they kinda got back to the vibe of it is...I cant wait.
I grew up watching enjoying Smosh’s humor and as a now 26 year old adult,  I found myself laughing at the small antics and jokes tossed in this interview. I can tell they themselves and their humor have matured along w me. I’m super excited to see what they put out and happy to see them together!
😭😭❤??
The internet is healing😢❤
Omg??? Finally?? I thought this episode will never come??😭😭😭
Listen, I'm still expecting Food Battle
"if we burn it to the ground im happy to do it with you" I WILL CRYYYY. i grew up watching the both of you and to see you both come together again feels so nostalgic and im happy you both are able to own what is truly yours once again
SHUT UP! -my fucking childhood
It's so great to see two men sit down and talk about their feelings
W video
This was not on my 2023 bingo card
yeah i dont think youtube would be cool wit jumper cables on yo nipples rn
smosh was my childhood. i would be so excited to see that they uploaded a video. food wars, their lunch vlogs and mail videos were so funny to me as a kid. im glad anthony now owns smosh with ian. smosh was never the same without anthony.
Oh so we just posting straight up therapy sessions on YouTube now? Okay. (I'm jk this was a great episode)
Still feels like a fever dream!! 😭 I can’t wait to see what you guys have in store. Knowing that you guys’ve grown with us reassures me that top quality videos will still be released despite having a different edge/sense of humor. ❤️
I KNEW this was coming! I KNEW!!
I'm so excited for this!
My dumb a** saw the thumb nail and  Was wondering if he spent a day with Anthony Padilla yet... 💀
The last words Ian said to Anthony definitely hit something in his heart. This was special to both of them and I can see it made him want to cry
its odd. i've watched this in parts for a while and i still feel like they got some resentment left.
This is the video i needed. Thank you.
This was practically a therapy session for these two it’s kinda funny great to see the back together though
The collab everyone needed but didnt expect it to happen
I absolutely love how excited Anthony sounds when he says “We own Smosh now”. He never hated Smosh or Ian, he just hated the thing Smosh had become. Years of seeing him completely detached and having no interest in appearing in Smosh branded things, it’s so heartwarming seeing him actually happy to have his Smosh back.
So happy for you guys🥹 I watched smosh pretty regularly until things really changed I’m assuming because of Defy acquiring it. I wasn’t even super into the same topics, but I just really enjoyed you guys and your humor and how you worked together. Excited to see what’s to come!
Oh shit this is Hype.
Man these guys seem to have rly good chemistry, I bet they’d be funny if they ever made videos together
Someone help me, I just ran to Turkmenistan from NJ, USA. I’m considered a national threat and wanted for many reasons such as pety theft and “Taking out military base” (This wasnt clear and was difficult to understand). I need somewhere in Australia to stay a few years. Please help a good soul, lord amen 🙏
SHUT UP! missed that
So whens food battle the game coming back and will it be on console this time???❤❤
fianlly
Smosh helped
first Wasabi Productions now Smosh. the world is healing
:)
🌚🌚🌚
I feel like all your OG viewers like me have grown and will enjoy the new content im so excited. My partner also watched a bit of smosh as a teenager so im excited to watch this now as a couple.
Your guys will always be my favourite YouTubers see when I use to go to school when a teacher made me angry I use to firetruck you
You do realize that one could develop a whole new generation of fanfics out of this 👀🤣 as a former fujoshi who shipped everyone with everyone my mind is already spinning, hahaha😂👀
My favorite duo on Youtube, seeing these two bros for life coming back as Smosh really bring us our childhood memories back! Feeling totally Amazing!
I dont want this dream to end <3
This is like your dad's getting back together AND I AM HERE FOR IT
See u qt mfs at vidcon 🤾🏻‍♂️
The World really is Healing a bit
I can feel a sense that they're in a way still angry with each other for how they fucked up the past.  But I also feel a strong sense of them wanting to fix it, and it's amazing. I love seeing old friends trying to fix a once really strong relationship.
Definitely need another collab with I Set My Friends On Fire PLEASE
The boys are back in town
the fanfiction mention was a fucking jumpscare
I'm so unbelievably happy for them. This is the most beautiful closure and the best outcome for all that has happened over the past 10+ years. I'm so happy that they have found themselves, and each other again, and can come back and still be comedically and interpersonally compatible. It makes me so happy that they still have that with each other. It's so rare and so special, and being able to witness it as someone who has seen the last two-thirds of this 2005-2023 saga, it just feels like a TV show's redemption arc. And it's beautiful.
this interview is cold asf
Boys Boys . . . Food battle 2023? 2024?
I wish old smosh made merch
I never liked Smosh, I learned to like Anthony trough this channel and this series. I just viewed Smosh as "NA-humour" that I could not connect with. Having said that, Im super happy for you either way. Im sorry you guys had to go trough all this corporate bullshit and Im thankful to Rhett  & Link for eventually saving the company and now making it possible for you guys to reclaim a part of yourselves.
What hurt me the most is that they never got a winner with the smosh summer/winter games, iirc they were tied when anthony left
This is like that kobe and shaq 1 on 1 interview lol
I miss lunchtime with smosh… 😢
I’ll never forget the disappointment in my dads eyes while I was watching the smosh movie thank you Anthony and Ian
About damn time
I thought it was against TOS to sell your YouTube channel to someone else?
Started watching smosh at 11 years old… now im 25. Glad you guys did this. Thank you.
Im so happy for you both!!! this is amazing to see :D
I want more Boxman....😂
Chupito cada vez que Ian dice "like" o "you know"
“If we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do that with you.” Omg I legit almost cried😭😭😭 (almost because I’m in a public space😂)  I’m so excited for you guys. I feel like I’m back in high school again. This is such a bizarre feeling.
I wonder if the Shut Up intros will return
Friendship always wins. Can't wait for the next Food Battle.
Im so happy you guys made it to this point. I cant wait for the new Smosh era!
I never knew that Anthony was a part of Smosh!
42:10 PLS make this merch again I like the aesthetic
WOW real IAN is so different from SMOSH ian i like this ... grown up IAN looks a lot fun ... hopefully we get to see this guy on videos more
I wished anthony would have guest starred in smosh at least once when he was gone, but glad he’s back!!
I can’t express how happy this makes me. I started watching smosh when I was 12, and it helped comfort me and keep me happy through the turbulent years of growing up. So happy for Ian and Anthony, they deserve all the happiness they can get <3
What a wholesome conversation. I'm glad you two found a way back together!
bring back the old hairstyles!!!
My eyes popped when I say this
i’m sorry but i feel like this is going to crash and burn so hard. it didn’t work the first time, why would it work now? and it doesn’t seem like people really watch your type of sketches anymore. your type of comedy is stuck in 2010’s, it’s not funny anymore. i hope you guys switch it up and i eat my words, love ya guys
<3
This was straight up just therapy for these two
Proud to say I was watching since the boxman days
Please bring back Smosh mail openings
Anthony can you do "I spent a day with FAZE RAIN / NORDAN SHAT" he is a very interesting person 😃
Im crying...again. i grew up woth ypu guys basically...well...your youtube content. This feels like comming home.❤
this is like "bringing back david tenant for a doctor who special" levels of nostalgia, except this is permanent, and im all here for it.
Pls stop supporting better health they scam people.
A podcast with these two is something I didn’t know I needed until now
I was here when they were starting. I was so addicted and honestly, hearing all this happening. I'm literally about to tear up. This is so amazing! My childhood is returning before my eyes 😢😢
Oohh I always wondered what happened. Pretty much Ian chose money of friendship
Everyone: WHOOOOOOOOOO
my literal childhood
I started watching smosh when I was 7 and you guys created hella memories on YouTube for me, my mom said I couldn’t watch you guys bc the humor you guys had and I always had to watch you guys when there was no one around 😂 loved it now I’m 19 and glad to see this and hear about this
Rhett and link are the complete opposites to Anthony and Ian when it comes to having  a work life and personal life balance. As someone who grow up watching both of them, I'm so happy they could learn a thing and two from em
I’m crying so hard in the club rn.   I remember watching Smosh is 2011 and It was the young days of YouTube. I remember watching the one about “men’s makeup” and this just like made my whole entire life. I fucking love Ian and Anthony for doing this, and good on them for that.   Edit: I’m typing and I’m just finishing the video and I am so glad they were able to literally set aside such big parts of their life to be able to make something that’s actually going to be them, and something they will feel proud to be able to put out. :’) they are all grown up yall  I cant wait to see what the future brings:)
I spent a day with Rhett and link  when??
This is so exciting. Thank you rhett and link especially for making this all possible
There are no words. Crying happy tears seeing these two together again 😭
Bring back lunch time with smosh
1:07:50 1 in 14 million odds but they got there
Lol let's explain what Smosh is be like
(I enjoyed smosh the movie ☠)
Holy shit I'm crying listening to two comedians talking
We need a 1 year later catch up video
Not even about Smosh here. I was a casual viewer back when, and dropped off even before things. But I’m still glad to see you guys getting where you want to be. There have been many conclusions to people- to things that ended in ways that personally left me worse off in life. Celebrities effecting your life is strange, and even stranger when they’re YouTubers, but I guess just seeing this now means other things for me.
Damn this was so healing😭I literally felt spiritual healing from this video💀
Ian you look so happy now glad to see you like that again 😂😂
This feels like Ian is interviewing Anthony in this interview
Wow, this is amazing! These guys were such a huge part of my childhood in those early years of Smosh. Really great to see them here together like this again
Tbh I'm just so glad that they both have their own hairstyles now-  No but seriously, I'm so so excited to see these two flourish (individually and as a duo) and it's amazing to see them open up and be so emotionally vulnerable while respecting and supporting each other.
Man anthony talking about finding himself after he left smosh and all the negative comments he received over that period of time made me so emotional! I’m so proud of him that he never gave up 😭
I am a french canadian and when I was younger, Smosh was the only motive to learn english fast, so I could understand the videos. Even if there was at the time a french subtitles channel, it wasnt all of their videos... Seeing them back together only makes me emotional, I can't explain how happy I am that the two original creators of Smosh is back together, making Smosh great again, it just wasn't the same without them, I am truly happy and I know a lot of people is as well, thought I could share this <3
Here's the real question: Is Lunchtime with Smosh coming back?
this makes me so happy to see
Good battle time???
Will you guys bring back gametime with smosh back too?
Omfg
1:09:24 the most important episode for me out of this marvelous series that Anthony is making is without a doubt "I spent a day with FACELESS YOUTUBERS".  That's when I met Corpse Husband, my biggest inspiration.    As for Comedy, words can't describe how thankful I am for the fact Smosh existed and was part of my late teens and early 20s.
oh my glob
Happiness
Watching this video as an adult while I'm at work doing paperworks feels weird asf like the last time I've seen them together was "AGES" ago when I was still a kid who plays pokemon on his Gameboy and just discovered Minecraft 👏😭
smosh was my entire childhood and seeing u both reunite again brings back such fond memories, it feels like a dream.
Classic YouTube sweep happens if Lucas buys the Fred channel back.
“Even if it burns to the ground… I’m glad to be doing it with you” - Ian   This…. This is the energy that made me cry. So real so so it’s got that power of friendship energy.  I love their friendship. 17 years and even through some hardships it’s there in tact and whole. ❤
GAYY!! Why don't you guys just get married already
i loved watching this video! good luck to both of you guys!
anthony’s jewelry on the mic making me think i got tinnitus
I had a good night's sleep yesterday because of this!
I haven’t watched Smosh in sooo long and I haven’t seen every single video but, Smosh was one of my first and favorite channels that I tried to keep up with and they just brighten my day. Ian and Anthony are such incredible guys and it makes me so happy to see them back together creating the content we all love. Such a nostalgic feeling :))
i am so excited to see the boys back in action
So does this mean we can get food battle 2023?
bringing up the milk fanfic… ahh middle school days.
Ian’s style looks like he’s trying to be a pimp
Thanks to you both for making this vid, it’s really encouraging for me regarding long term friendships that have gone through rough patches due to us just needing to learn more about relationships and relationship with self, and learning to accept change and respect our boundaries and needs
🎉
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS
The Gods of Nostalgia now have returned.
6 years later.
thats grazy
Smosh was really a part of my childhood. To hear everything that's been said in this video - and most importantly the surprising announcement - I got pretty emotional. I'm so glad and looking forward to more stuff! YAAAYY! MOMENTOUS DAY.🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m 33 and I started watching Smosh when I was in college in Sac. I loved it. Watched everything from the Pokémon videos to the lunch with smosh and fan mail videos. I am amazed at your growth emotionally and being able to touch on difficult feelings with each other and excited to see brand new content now that so much has changed for the better. Proud of you both!
this two dudes have such chemistry together. they should make a channel together or something.
Rhett and Link next
adhd and autism techtree team up.
Food battle 2023?
42:05 "my childhood friend that I grew up with is still here" dang that's some good stuff
I feel like my parents are getting back together
Having watched you guys growing up, I feel like this is an intimate conversation with friends. Hyped and hope you guys are my reason to watch youtube in adult life. I hope you and Ian work well with longevity.
When Anthony said “my best friend that I grew up with is still here” really hit hard. I love seeing you two together again
The smosh movie was great
I hope you guys make Smosh more popular and relevant than ever before. The same way Steve Jobs did to Apple after they fired him.
i was hyped but hesitant at first after seeing the announcement but now i'm just FULL ON HYPED HOLY SHIT
These 2 vibe so well, they should probably run a channel together or something
You guys introduced me to YouTube with your Pokemon theme song video (#1 most viewed for a while). I'm glad you are back together. Thank you for making my life from high school to now more enjoyable. I wish you both the best.
Im excited for the future of Smosh and this friendship/partnership
Dude I thought the smosh movie was awesome 💀 nbs even to this day
going to cry real quick
Absolutely loved watching this and seeing how you've both grown in different ways since. And yet, still finding common ground in your senses of humour together. I'm really looking forward to seeing you both do sketch comedy again but I'm just as happy seeing your separate content too. It was awesome seeing how vulnerable you both were here talking about your time at Defy and how the friendship shifted over time. Wishing you both the best with your future projects!
im so so so so so so happy about this. my entire childhood. like they said even if the channel does not work out at least they are doin this together. so happy for them :))
this is heart warming.. i was a product of smosh growing up❤❤❤
So proud and of you both!!! I can’t even express how happy I am to see you regain ownership of your channel (and much respect to Rhett and Link for the support that gave you along the way). I’m stoked to see what the future brings for you 🎉 CONGRATS You deserve this!!
This is so nostalgic, watching this makes me feel 9 again. But damn, I haven't saw these two in a while, Ian became full businessman, he used to be so goofy, he's hella serious now.
This was the moment I wanted to see  It’s great seeing Anthony and Ian seeing each other again
Sooo then smash took over the internet EPIC FOOD BATTLE soon tm?
You two owning Smosh again is one of those things us fans wished for but never thought we'd get. Thank you for coming back 😁. Oh and I actually liked the movie by the way
Food Battle 2023 finna be crazy
They are so funny together. It sucks we didn’t get to see how their humour could have blossomed if they weren’t leashed by the company
Remember when Julian Smith called both of them about eating corn dogs in a hot tub late at night ? Good times
I’m not exaggerating. My entire childhood… can finally rest easy after this video. I was absolutely one of those 10 year olds
This wasn’t an episode to get to know someone better..  This was an episode of two best friends reuniting after quite a few years..  And it’s great to see them talk about the past on where they started and see where they came to this day.
Challenge for Ian : not saying the word "like" for a whole day
Ohhh... Thank G! If only this guys knew they are my saviour during my difficult time. Im an adult and yes i am a smosh baby now an adult 😅 i watch their different era. And glad im still here witnessing this ❤
I never thought we’d all be so lucky to see a moment like this happen. Working at Smosh for over 6 years completely changed my life and it will always feel like home. I’m so proud of both of you and how far you’ve come. This is so heartwarming to see! I’m so excited to see what’s next ❤ Congrats dinguses!!!
Bro my life is complete
this is crazy to see the og smosh coming back.. this was fire too, i def need a smoshcast
THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED! THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED! THIS IS my childhood finally giving me what I wanted🥲
I remember when my dad bought smosh the movie for me and my siblings.....we were ecstatic and thats all we would watch. until our younger sibling scratched it...even then we would watch the movie...smosh really brought me and my brothers weird humor together...so thank you guys for creating that childhood for me and my siblings....anyways can't wait for the upcoming projects!
O SHIT
I grew up watching your videos from like age 10!!! I remember the Pokemon video was one of the first Youtube videos I'd ever seen; my dad showed it to me. Your videos never traumatized me lol, they weren't disturbingly inappropriate. Growing up on your content as a tween and young teen was probably one of the best influences that I got from early Youtube. I'm so excited that you both own YOUR company again!!! I've enjoyed what Smosh has done while owned by Rhett and Link but I won't deny that I'm INSANELY excited for this! Haven't been this excited about Smosh since I was a kid🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
This is so awesome to see and something I've wanted to see forever. I'm so excited for you guys. You guys could do like a I spent a day with old smosh fans video now, I feel like that would be really cool. I'm available btw lmao, I cant wait to see your sketches!
its been so many years of watching these two grew up then apart and now that there back together its truly amazing im so glad this happened
I hope you still continue this channel as well as doing smosh. Now that you two are basically the owners again you can probably do that.
43:07 the true definition of “right guy wrong time”   God I missed them so much!!! I really hope Anthony keeps doing I spent a day with videos but I’m so excited to show my kids the same goofy boys I would watch every day (god I’m old…lol)
This is a wonderful week.
Please consider bringing back Ian is bored and lunchtime with smosh, they were my absolute favorite!
I was a literal 10 yr old watching and I love Smosh the movie so thanks
i thought i was sensing a slight passive aggressive attitude in their latest videos . even when they are filming lol.
I read alot of the notorious smosh fics back in like 2013 just to see what was up with it cause I kept hearing about it.... some of that stuff just sticks with you, it would get so disturbing it was almost like a contest btwn who could write the most fd up stories. I literally didn't eat cherrys or cherry flavored things for a solid 2 years bc of this one hellish story.... Anyway, decade later and I can only hope they don't find themselves in notoriety again...
It was a crazy winding road, sometimes it had forks in it, and you had to split up, but I'm so glad the paths met pack up! You guys earned this moment in so many ways. Congratulations to you both  ❤❤❤
This was just so incredibly healthy and beautiful and totally healed my inner child. I just feel so serene after watching this :,)
6 FEET APART CAUSE THEY'RE NOT GAY
Anthony has changed so much though. The left got to him :(
y'all own smosh again?! alright. I want mail videos, and skits. hear me?!
The big question is are they going to bring back food battle 😂
These two guys seem cool, they should make a YouTube channel together or something
"Trying to create something bigger than oursleves" you didn't just try. You suceeded, YOU guys are my childhood
who travelled back in time and kicked a rock to make us go back to the good timeline?
You picked the perfect time to come back when your 12 year old audience now has money
happy ending
The two of you just having fun riffing off each other at the end is everything honestly if that's where it is I might get a membership cause I missed this
props to that biology teacher
My inner child has ascended
We're back on the good timeline
Ian is more into business than anthony who is more into creative stuff
holy shit
This just makes me so genuinely happy.
man these guys are just straight legends and my literal childhood. it's so great seeing them still being friends after all this time. so excited for the next chapter of smosh!
Now this is content
51:48 Ian is given a business rundown while car fails to start
I showed my friend that Smosh is back, she asked wtf is Smosh....never felt more old in my life....im only 23
I hope food battle comes back 😂
this is something i never expected to see since anthony left smosh but here we are
Wouldn’t have it any other way
Okay but Food battle 2023 would kinda be sick!
28:47
Now if Jenna marbles comes back I might just have an aneurism😂
Growing up and watching Smosh are my favorite memories from my childhood. I remember going to camp and writing letters to my brother about who won Food Battle 😂💀 this was amazing to hear the real story and about your lives during that time. It's really eye opening. Plus I'm stoked y'all are together, so excited for new videos.
Damn even I cried😅
This is extremely awkward
Please bring back every blank ever
Anthony wanted to punch Ian in the face the whole video lol. He deserved it.
I am happy smosh is together and i hope anthony still continues to do his more serious interview style stuff on this channel while you know being the second half that is the batshit silly comedy that is smosh.
I will be honest, a while back I kinda unsubscribed from smosh cause it felt like it wasn’t smosh anymore, but if it is coming back looks like I’m becoming a channel member now, best of luck to u both❤
I was crying man. I'm so happy for them. Fuck defy media.
I was so happy to see you guys back for one more video you guys were a part of my childhood growing up
can they make a video where Anthony wears an emo wig and Ian wears a bowl cut one
Wait heoox is his real last name  I thought it was a dick joke back in the day
Yo
The first YouTube video I ever watched was your "Pizza Zombies" video back in 2009. Smosh was a HUGE part of my childhood. So happy for this!
Whyd they leave the clip out where ians butt cheeks were out?
please remake the smosh and mykie collab PLEASE
I am happy they went back to being friends maybe best friend in the future
congrats guys!!
The only 2 people i would rather watch on Smosh. I never bothered to even watch anymore ever since the new people took over Smosh. Now, seeing these 2 together again is like something I needed after a decade
This has been an insane journey to watch, started watching when I was maybe 12? Im gonna be 21 this year and am just so happy for yall! I have fallen off these past couple years but am so happy to see yalls growth and for whats to come!
I've always known about Smosh since the beginning, but I never watched it until Smosh Pit a couple years ago. I saw the videos on Smosh's channels since the announcement, and between those and this video I am so excited for you guys and whats to come. I could feel the difference with Ian in the try not to laugh, and I can feel just the beautiful energy between two best friends reconnecting just authentically and so wonderfully. I know Smosh has always been at the core your friendship, but I think this interview is showing all of the viewers a renewall of that core but in a way that will only allow you both and smosh blossom. I'm really happy for you guys in your business ventures, but I'm even more happy about your friendship. If anything knowing this whole journey makes me want to support you both and smosh more!
holy cow
I just realized I haden’t heard Anthony’s laugh since he left smosh until right now… unlocked a piece of my childhood/teen years I didn’t realized I forgot
This is the Lunch Time with Smosh Movie
Damn there was more to Ian and Anthony in the back round
"It's going to go well, it's going to go well." -Anthony "Even if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you." -Ian The truest of friends right there.
Anthony is the best dad there ever was... Shook hands with me and made a baby girl. Shut up Stevie.
i have started watching smosh when i was a 13 year old kid… now 25… damn. This brings nostalgia
AhhhHhHhHhHhH
Oh my god, they are back.🙂😭😭😭🤣😂😂🤣😃😄
I knew you both separately but didn’t know about the history of smosh but I’m so happy that you guys got your baby back
11:38  That’s so raven moment, Or the sound for the thing he used in Inception,  Edited because periods suck, and commmas rule,
Glad i didn't missed out on this, used to watch it.
i'm so glad you guys were able to rekindle your friendship. and congrats on obtaining smosh.
this is a cultural reset
It breaks my heart to hear you two grew apart long before Anthony left Smosh. I understand the passive aggressiveness and the animosity between you two since I went to college with multiple roommates. I can't imagine making skits and managing a business at the same time with them. You are both adults now and well capable of communicating and making better decisions together. Remake some awesome classics like Dixon Cider, Assassin's Creed, Zelda Rap, etc. I would watch the fuck outta em. (edit: i completely understand why you wouldn't tho. an OG fan can dream lol.)
This is a very mature conversation. Kudos to you both.
This is really a magical thing to happen :) I'm wondering what this means for a lot of Pit content? Are they going to be still working out of the GMM sets/with the same crews, because there are a lot of behind the camera people that have evolved into in front of camera personalities as well that I would hate to see less often due to the purchase. Also Eat It or Yeat It is pretty much a crossover show of Smosh Pitt and Mythical Kitchen.
“Anyone know what smosh is?” Yeah it was my child hood..
I'm so glad they found each other again!
Make more lunch time with smosh
I was here
Anthony seems way more open and genuine than Ian. Is it just me?  Or maybe Ian knows Anthony too well and thinks it's not a genuine conversation? So he's just keeping reserved?  Idk it feels like one of them isn't being genuine
I am so fucking happy
That ad positioning was dirty
This is truly the canon event.
All I’m hearing is……Food Battle 2023/2024? 👀
I haven’t heard that name in 50 years…
Ian to much into buisness. Smosh was never good after anthony left. There was views but it was purely children, like how top yt videos are for children. If he is gonna focus on buisness instead of quality hes going to make terrible videos that everyone that cares about OG smosh spirit gon die
Will YouTube Rewind be back?
Dixon Cider round 2 when?
Dude you don’t understand how happy I was seeing this. Like seriously hearing everything about what’s been going on with you two is honestly making me feel like things in my life may turn out ok. Thank you guys ❤
I must be dreaming
this is legit inspirational documentary material  I’d watch the hell out of that movie
Rhett and Link, the ultimate best friends
They’re in their silly happy zaddy eras and we all love them for it ❤
Its kinda strange see they without the emo hair
i used to watch this guys in the infant stages of smosh videos!! awesome reunion!!!
Idc if they burn it to the ground cus I’ll go down with them I’ll stay true to the end like they are true to each other, love you both!
I'm hyped as fuck, but what will happen to this channel?
I have chills 😅 the O-F$&@ING-G’s are back.
i can totally see them getting a show on comedy central. sorta like dave chappelle show or key and peele. i can also see ian being a movie director. he gives that sorta vibes. glad that these  two legends are back together
holy shit i can’t believe this day has come
You guys own Smoth again?!?! LETS. FUCKING. GOOOOOOOOOO!
Art is amazing until you mix it with business.
The milk fic? In 2023? And to think I was gonna be around for the 20th anniversary… I grew up on you two from the time I knew what YouTube was (way too early) I’ve been watching since I was probably 6 with older cousins, showing my friends videos in middle school, background noise when I was studying in high school, watching after work to bring me a laugh, and now at 21 I show my younger siblings smosh and give them a look into what I enjoy. They aren’t always impressed but whenever the 10yo and 8yo walk past each other they utter a random Shayne character catchphrase 😂 this is pretty surreal to me and I can’t wait to witness all the debauchery to come ❤
NUT
finally
mmm
This is so emotional and beautiful, you guys were a big part of early my high school teen years, it makes me glad to see you reconnect and see you iron out the remaining wrinkles, both being so honest to each other, ngl I got teary eyed at several points, so excited to have Smosh back to full force again :')
I thought Michael from vsauce would be the best new video, but this barely surpassed it for me. And that means a lot
now that’s smosh is back let’s get the 2nd channel going & some fan mail & daily life of the men now🤯
Its so crazy to see anthony and ian back together again
Can you guys please just make a podcast I need it in the top of my rotation PLEASE!!!
This is the best thing ever.
ok with this in mind, we gotta get remakes of the old og videos, bring back box man
Ian says at the end of the day it was Just Business and though I am only 25min in i think that is a good example of the problem. Smosh wasnt Just Business it was entertainment. When they sold smosh it became just business and Ian accepted that while Anthony refused it. Turning a youtube channel into Just Business is what shitty things like buzzfeed do, not real creators like Pewds, Reeves, or Dunkey. IDK maybe im trippen but I think that was where a lot of the problems between them stemmed.
sobbing
The best video so far. I love how the universe brought you two back together. Wishing you both the best and excited to see what is to come ❤
I remember being in high school and asking my guy friends what smosh was after hearing them talk. Here we are like 14 years from that time, I had the overwhelming need to shout to one of those friends about how yall are together again. It's like those glory days of the channel instantly feel renewed in a new light. It is exciting to hear. I do not doubt that member support will come though on it.
I could have gone the rest of my life not remembering that the smosh movie was a thing
Smosh was the first ever channel i saw youtube when i was 9. Now im 22. And its crazy to think that all of us, even Ian and Anthony, have grown up and have been through tough times but have come back together again to enjoy something that brought so mucn happiness and joy❤
I watched smash at the age of 8 😂
Anthony and Ian OnlyFans when?
It’s really interesting to see the differences in how the best friend duo on youtube affected smosh vs how it affected rhett and link
I'm so excited of this new Smosh era, looking forward for the iconic SHUT UP in every opening sequence.
Lol as someone who only started watching Smosh recently and I really like how it is. I'm very interested in how this will go. I love the cast, I hope they still get the spotlight. I'm sure they will.
Im happy to see what's to come
This is such a strange thing to watch, I'm overjoyed that you have once again found your friendship. I think I'll give new smosh another chance.
When’s good battle
I remember finding Smosh in like 2012 through the second channel where you were opening fan mail, it came up recommended below Nyan Cat. I would gladly keep watching even if you guys just did lunchtime with Smosh every day and didn't bother with any sketches, your friendship dynamic has always been at the heart of what makes your content special.
51:42 In all my years watching this channel, I don't think I've ever heard that laugh before 😂😂😂 I may have never gotten in to Smosh, but it's always nice to see someone in their happy place :p (esp when it's been so long since they've been there.. hope things continue to work out for you guys)
Wow, I'm so emotional.
Smosh the movie wasn’t bad at all yall tripping😭
As a 30 year old who grew up during the mortal kombat and pokemon vids this is so nostalgic and heartwarming to see, SMOSH and FND films were my friend groups go to videos to watch/mimic as kids/highschoolers. I cant wait to see what they do and regardless of how its received by the public I'm glad its back in their hands.
This is an incredible arc. I am so happy to have watched this journey
This is the realist thing and most understanding conversation I’ve seen in a long time
Ian looks like a chill dad and Anthony is the cool uncle that you would spend the whole family meeting with. All joke aside, the reconnecting part brought me some tears. It was really beautiful that you two can talk about it this way.
1:11:35 dont make me cry guys DONTTTT 🤧🤧
Anthony leaving was a canon event.
Friends can be soulmates too ❤
Smosh was one of the first few videos I remember watching on YouTube in my childhood. I stopped watching after the split and this feels like a reunion of sorts and brought back so much nostalgia. I'm now 22 and super excited to see how Smosh will be like with the two of you back!!
We need the camera footage of that lunch
I’m BEYOND ECSTATIC that smosh is back together 🩵☺️
Anthony leaving Smosh was actually a good thing because it made Defy leave Smosh which saved the rest of the cast from the "abusers".
Anthony and Ian I can’t tell you how many laughs you two have given me. When Anthony left smosh I was older and understood, but you guys were my childhood and you have been so many other peoples childhood. It’s so good to see smosh is getting back together as an original channel. I can’t wait to see you guys grow the channel to where you guys want to see it go. Because that is smosh, it’s not corporate it’s 2 guys who make videos that make each other laugh. Thank you Ian and Anthony
now THIS IS nostalgia!
They say that true friends can go years without speaking or meeting but find themselves again in a matter of minutes once they do meet. I think this proves that. There are a lot of friends I wish I had the courage to reconnect with today...and you know what? Maybe I will.
A few days ago my friend and I were reminiscing about the old days of youtube and watched a bunch of smosh videos. fast forward to yesterday, that same friend told me that Ian and Anthony bought smosh back. Insane timing. (I like to think we summoned smosh back to life)
ay yo don't say it's been 17 years since smash was made
I wish my ex and I could have a chat half as pleasant as this one. And half as satisfactory. Maybe in another universe.
Ian, you don’t owe us anything, you owe it to yourself
I'm so happy for you 2
Smosh - Anthony and Ian’s Version
Anthony rlly had a Reputation Era
Anthony... you are SMOSH no matter what and it was a great part of my life so thanks.
Smosh Taylor’s Version
Homie is annihilating the trending tab 😮‍💨
YOOOOOOO 🎉🎉
It’s amazing seeing you two back together again, I remember when I would watch your Smosh videos when I was younger and how much it made me laugh. Excited to see what you two have in store for the future of Smosh!
It feels like divorced parents get back together😅
HOW IS NO ONE EXPECTING FOOD BATTLE 2024?
My inner Child is Happy
So return of favorite food battles???
BRING BACK SMOSH!!
wow 🥹
Sooo where's the milk fanfic?
WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT FF 😶
I’m 18 and I watch smosh since I was 6 -7 and I’ve been watching everyday since
God, I have so much to say. You guys have been in my head, my heart, my life for almost 14 years. I have loved, questioned, embraced,  disliked, and supported everything you guys have ever done. I was subscribed to the three main channels plus ask charlie and shut up cartoons, I played the app you guys made and 100%ed it, I was here for every single person joining after you guys sold the channel, and I supported you Anthony, on this channel after you left. I knew there have been rough patches and bad luck and confusion with everything and I knew everything was somewhat necessary, but I'm really glad you guys found each other and were able to patch up your friendship and be able to make content again. I also would like to say, your pitch for the main channel videos is exactly what I was hoping: fresh content with similar humor to your old stuff while only having references here and there for us OGs. I'm really excited, perhaps for the first time in a long time, and I cannot wait to see what you guys do with everything.   P.S. I really hope you tell Chanse of your existence, Anthony. He's been living under a rock lol.
i’ve been a fan of smosh since the early days of youtube, i grew up on this channel and it makes me BEYOND ecstatic that you two are bringing back the classic comedy i grew up on :)) but i have to ask…   what is the milk fanfic?
This is amazing and I'm so excited for yall!
Smosh and Wassabi productions getting back together??  Hoping for Jenna Marbles next 🤣
It was very sad to watch the decline of Ians mental health after Anthony left smosh. You could tell that he always felt like something was missing, he just didnt have the energy he used to. But over the last 6 months, hes been smiling a lot more, being way more proactive, and interactive with the cast. And now we know why. He finally got his best friend back. At least, that's what it seems like to me, based on the timeline of events.   They both are commendable for how they handled the Defy issues, for different reasons. Anthony, I admire because he took a step back and realized he needed to leave for his own physical and mental health, and to figure out who he was now. Ian I admire because he followed his dream and career even through some pretty shitty times, and eventhough the cast give him crap constantly (usually in jest) he never abandoned them, looked out for them, and tried to make decisions that would help the whole crew, not just his own career.
Loving the og youtubers going through their therapy era
molester moon you will be missed
pleeeease bring back food battle, just for the memories (even if its the last food battle ever 🥺)
Or just shoot react videos on the main with the new members or short teasers of your new sketches, or vr videos
i’m proud to have enjoyed the movie, still have my signed poster from walmart somewhere
oh my god
Now just get your old hair back
I was one of the 7 year olds spending all day on youtube watching smosh when I probably shouldn't have been, this is like mom and dad getting back together
mikey is a reverse joko
You have my money! Happy for you both!
Naruto and Sasuke are back <3
2023: Oasis reunion 🚫😰 SMOSH REUNION ✅
If we get another food battle. . .
This honestly means so much to me, growing up watching smosh was a huge part of my life being homeschooled watching your videos every day. This makes my soul sooo happy to see you guys together again. Much love ❤️
My inner child smiled when I saw this video
This episode needed to happen. That is all I can say. If they get it back I know Smosh will be bigger then it was then. This was more of what they needed to hear and reassurance and closure of things they thought but wasn't true and assumed a lot this pretty much closure of there past relation as friends.
The miracle ive been waiting for years, holy shit! I believed anthony would return one day, yaaay!
SHUT UP THE MOVIE WAS AMAZING
Im happy the OGs are back damn there hair styles changed alot thats what im suprised on
Ian is so cute in that shirt
Ian really held it down when Anthony left! 🥹
man this whole thing deserves a 3 seasons sitcom your history is really amazing i lov you guys
"I am fundametnally unchanged, but not unevloved." great quote from a physics book I read that fits Ian and Anthony.
Lol i love how they’re thinking like “what if people like us less now that we’re not owned by a corporate entity and instead own ourselves again, the way people originally fell in love with us”
I’m not crying I swear
I remember i used to always watch smosh when i came home from school. You were right though, probably shouldn't have watched that but I'm glad i did. I was so sad when you and ian went separate ways, i could kinda see the friendship deteriorating and it bummed me out too see my childhood was ending. Kept following both of you though. It was interesting seeing your separate journeys and discovering yourselves. So excited to see classic smosh is back and that you two have gotten back together and worked out your differences. It was definitely magical whatever you guys were doing, cant wait to see it again. Best of luck to you both cant wait to watch
this has to be better than sex right
my heart omg! I'm so happy for you both!! it's that divine timing :) Cheering you guys on!
YES!!!!!!! IAN AND ANTHONY ARE BACK!!!!!! It's good to see you two back together again!
I was waiting for this interview ever since you started "I spent a day with" I'm so excited for this wishing you the best of luck can't wait to see the sketches you wrote come to life.
This felt like 5 minutes. Crazy
❤‍🩹
I have less concerns… 😅
im....so HAPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
what was Anthony's inspiration for his tattoo? <3
This is headass like if the beatles got back together.
Im so happy my 2 dads are getting remaried!
you never really think about all the behind the scenes with youtuber friendships like smosh. back all those years ago when anthony was still with smosh, everyone just assumed that they were the bestest friends in the world with no problems at all. when in reality, it wasn’t really like that at all.  hearing all of this really gives me a new perspective on how people present themselves online. i think it’s so beautiful they both opened up like this
The NOSTALGIA
DOES THIS MEAN FOOD BATTLE IS COMING BACK???!?!?!?!?!
This feels like watching two therapist having a session with  each other.
Im just gonna say I fricken loved ghostmates. I don't even know how to explain it honestly, it's just fun
The world is healing
The truth sets things free and I’m very happy you both are🙂 its so good that you both recognize your love for one another and can express how that has driven your friendship, creative work, support and benefits throughout your lives. Im happy you both are at a place in time were you are free and stable to know what to do. Really wish and pray for your success and wellbeing🙂 Also: my favorite videos were your daily vlogs of eating and hanging out. Id be very happy if you guys would like to do that because its fun hanging with you guys that way even though its online and recorded🙂😄
omg i remember those dudes back in my recomedation in early 2010 in my old acc nostalgia days man with those emo haircut too :((
So food battle 2023??????
Rhett and Link are the fucking GOATs too.
I hope they shoot at their old house in Sacramento. that would be classic and nostalgic.
I loved the movie
A long awaited content
Saw you guys at Dave & Busters as a kid and was the weird kid just staring at you guys. Got to talk to you and say hi and you asked if I wanted to meet Ian. I said no its fine and then awkwardly shuffled away. 26 now and love that you bought back my childhood. Used to watch you guys, Shane Dawson, SwiftKarateChop, makemebad whatever numbers, Des n Nate. Simpler times. Nice to see the people that shaped me as a child growing and developing over the years.
1:11:35 That was the best moment for me, if there is any takeaway from this video it's that. One of the most emotional, real, and honest thingIan said. Like that quote from Everything Everywhere all at Once.
1:11:36 will forever be my favourite words from Ian. So heartwarming and pure, it feel so real. Congrats both of you. Thank you Rhett & Link 🥳🤩
Ill never forget when i first got introduced to smosh. I still love the stuff ian and anthony did. #1 will always be the legend of zelda music video.
Anthony interview dreamybull please
That's so funny because I was a kid when I watched them like 7-9 years old
pog
yOU DID NOT JUST GASLIGHT US WITH THE FREAKING MILK FIC 😭😭 I was thinking that this was such an emotional and amazing video then you kILLED ME AT THE END WITH THE MILK FIC REFERENCES 😭😭
Nostalgic asffff👏🏼
my childhood 🥺. I can't wait. I'm so happy
For a long time I missed seeing you guys together, but it was never for the old smosh. It was knowing that you two were still friends and doing okay. It was really worrisome that there wasn't much updates but I'm glad to know why. I'm so thankful you two were able to get back to being a duo again and that two legendary best friends are back together in front of camera and behind camera! <3
The prodigal son has returned
God, Ian and Anthony were the first guys I ever watched on YouTube, and I still think about those old Boxman videos today, fucking classic.
I grew up on Smosh and I absolutely loved it, seeing you guys talking and planning to make more videos together is making this year so much better.
they came back at a perfect time
They started Smosh over 17 years ago and it's still doing well. It's literally their baby that they've raised to maturity. They're successful parents now XD
Yay, cant wait for the reunion tour
brother smosh the movie was so fun to watch it's a classic
The overwhelming support from Rhett and Link for Ian and Anthony to make videos again together was so sweet. Not as their business partners, but as friends wanting to help other friends make amazing content together too.
oh man my childhood 🥲
mmmmmmmmmmmmmillk
Writing a movie bout yall fr
steaming, crying, dying.
I clicked this so fast. Y’all were the first OG YouTubers and one of my first subscriptions. I still think about so many funny moments from lunchtime with smosh y’all made me laugh so hard
Cant wait for the pokemon skits again ❤
Should’ve used the original “SHUP UP” intro on this one😭😭
I was wondering when these two were finally gonna meet
1:11:36 "and if we burn it to the ground I am happy to do that with you" stopppp 😭😭❤
I was playing through the old Assassin's Creed games this past week. It reminded me of the Assassin's Creed 3 music video Smosh made over a decade ago when I was in 5th grade. Still remember the 7+ hour livestream you guys did to help fundraise the Smosh game you guys were making. That was probably the first livestream I had ever watched, and I think I watched at least 5 hours of it as a middle schooler. It's weird to think I went from watching you guys doing music videos and doing Ian Is Bored when I was nearly 12 to being 22 and almost graduating with my bachelor's in civil engineering.
What happened to Smosh is like a movie story, and now we have the happiest ending for that story.
Smosh has been a huge part in my life and I’m finally starting to enjoy smosh again
This is the real smosh the movie
Consider bringing back Lunchtime with Smosh PLS🙏🏻
OgSog collab when
You know what? THIS story should be the new smosh movie. This movie would be loved by SO many fans.
WHAT ABOUT SMOSHCAST??????
I will probably listen to this conversation few times. Such a joy.
Bring back Ryan Todd
I would love to hear Anthony’s take on how Courtney, Shayne and Damien specifically stepped up huge when he left. Without them, Smosh wouldn’t have survived. I love Ian but doing it alone wouldve Been so hard
Hello there.  So much respect for you, IAN and ANTHONY. I was listening and watching the whole video with such a joy and good feelings. It's increnedible how  2 friends can talk about all that have brought them together up to this point.  It's resonates a lot with me in terms of my personal life as me and my "Anthony" split up also about 6 years ago. This was accidentaly the time when I have started to be more familiar with YT and get knowing the Smosh. I'm 39 now, but still hoping to be back together and do all the things as we used to. Wondering from time to time  how it may be. Your converation giving me that  kind of glimpse of this.  Thank you for sharing and inviting us to your world. Thank you for creating the Smosh, Ian:) I'm wishing you both a lot of fun creating comedy and exciting for all what the future may hold for you and for us as a viewers, but most of all I'm crossing fingers for you to staying as a good friends. Nothing more preciouse than this.  What we need more is YT like this. Also what a such an awesome people are Rhet and Link. Much respect for them.  In summary,  BURN IT TO THE GROUND BOYS!  All the best, Peter.
This was the therapy session we all needed. Thank you for your open candid-ness. Seeing how your faces lit up throughout this conversation fills my heart with joy. Looking forward to watching your continued journey together. Much love and respect.
Smosh the movie was a banger. i used to watch it weekly
Biggest W of 2023
nah why am I tearing up a lil bit
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
I’m happy
Not them talking about the milk fic 😭😭😭😭
that's awesome
Not me crying, lol 😭
Rhett and Link prove once again how amazing of people they are. You won’t find anyone who’s worked for them that’ll say a bad thing. And they focus on the people rather than the business. I’ve always respected them to the max, but this reinforces that
IAAANNNNN
Am I the only who got these weird vibes from Ian? It was kinda uncomfortable. BUT SMOSH IS BACK LETS GOOOOOO
Anthony telling Ian this memorie of his that made him feel like they were such close friends and Ian not remembering at all is so sad but also so relatable. I love them both they are also the first mukbangers with lunch time with smash! Gotta eat the crispy bits ❤
Hop on the commentary boat I feel like people would love that from ya’ll
Ian looks like he moves cocaine around and Anthony smokes xanax.
So this confirms Smosh the Movie 2 … right?
I FORGOT ABOUT THE MILK FICS OMG
This is wonderful!❤
On their movies I definitely think the smosh movie was less than great lol but I’ll legit go watch the ghost friends movie often for comfort idk maybe it’s just nostalgia but I don’t think it’s any worse than other movies that ride of of that
I am so excited to see them back together again both as friends AND collaborators. OG smosh was my comfort!
Im really hoping theres at least one sketch made with assassins creed 3 playing in the background or something
today i resubscribed to smosh. what a good day.
I can't be the only one who feels sad watching this. It seems to me like Anthony missed his friend a lot more than Ian did. Happy to see them together again and I hope I'm wrong but that is the vibe I get.
I LOVED the smosh movie! I still can't believe they got Steve Austin in there
this is like watching my step dads come together for my birthday just to tell me they getting married
Congratulations!! it’s been so inspiring watching your journeys. So excited for all that lays ahead for you both! 💐
Guys I just had a thought, after Anthony left Smosh, Smosh would've been ended if Ian weren't there. It must've been so difficult for him to manage it during that time.
I love you guys! I've watched you guys since the beginning. I missed all the drama, cuz you know (life) but I just want you to know that you are loved, both of you. I fell in love with YOU guys, not a company, so do your special magic! The creators need to be in charge 100%! I'm so sorry you guys went through all that but it's an absolute joy to see you two together again. YouTube pioneers prosper!  🏴‍☠️ you guys are so strong and I never thought I would see a video like this. Made my day and I cried ALOT.  Rock on! Love the new beginning you guys are on. Please ENJOY yourselves!!🎉
FINALLY some good wholesome news
I love it how Anthony laughs like a 15 year-old teenager when he is with Ian. Really makes me happy to see this friendship ❤️
Never forget the video Anthony and Ian made where they showed the cum stains on the poster of the girls asses 🫡
The collar we all wanted and all knew we needed
❤❤
I still won’t.  Had me dying 😂
The thing is both of you are YouTube legends. My boys introduced me to your videos when they were in elementary school and now one has graduated from college and the other will be a senior this fall. This thing that is happening is world changing and we are all here for it. Ian and Anthony together again as Smosh. Finally some good happening in the world. Bring it.
this and the smosh main video have made me so happy. the story is amazing and it really is something to be excited about
It’s really easy to forget that Anthony was a part of smosh at one point
Finally, a rival to Ghetto Smosh
Fun time w/ Smosh please
I remember binge watching lunch time with smosh episodes growing up. It was probably my favorite series of theirs
“Let’s burn it to the grown together!”….everyone else at Smosh…😳😳😳
Please post some good videos on the main channel too so I can see if I wanna buy the membership thing I’m so hyped y’all came back I love y’all! I love the skits y’all are legends def the OGs of YouTube I asked my girl if she’s ever seen a food battle and she she no and I was heartbroken 😂
4:59  sell your company through stock wasn’t necessarily a terrible idea, if you had sold the stock when smosh was at an all time high, it would have been worth a lot. Another example of that working would be Jordan and Nike. Jordan requested to have a portion of his deal to be in stock and we all know how that turned out, Jordan is one of the biggest brands out there. Slightly different scenario but it worked out very well.
This is the gayest video ever to contain only two straight guys and it's all I ever wanted
I like to think that Rhett and Link saw themselves in Ian and Anthony, and realize that their success easily could’ve gotten down the way that Smosh could’ve gone down and they wanted to make sure that they would always be protected
I understand why Ian was hurt by Anthony leaving, but I also get Anthony. I really feel like he had to completely separate himself from that and start completely fresh, and now he’s come full circle and ready to embrace smosh again 😊
Holy shit SMOSH, SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!
I IMMEDIATELY searched for the milk fan fic… save yourselves. Don’t do it 🙂 1:13:11
what an amazing conversation! so lovely to see people be so emotionally vulnerable, honor each other’s experiences, and so eye-opening as a 10+ year fan to hear about the inner workings. Absolutely love that y’all are starting off this era of Smosh with this included, sets the tone off right 🖤
"Let's burn it to the ground together" NO, Shayne doesn't have Goldbergs money anymore he NEEDS THIS, lmao  Also, hell, I may have to go read fanfiction for the first time in a decade, just to see how bad this milk fic is.
YOU BOTH WERE MY CHILDHOOD AND I NEVER FORGOT THE JOY YOU BROUGHT TO ME AS A KID!!! We really needed this! I Love you both!!!
I love how Ian says "like" every 2 words its funny af. fucking love these lads !😛😶‍🌫
42:07 this is the thing. Anthony is tearing up because he does finally realize Ian was hurt a lot. Ian suffered a lot because of Anthony’s assumptions- my friend is long gone.. our friendship faded.. Ian never felt that.. notice the words they used.  Ian has always been waiting but things got hard… because Anthony keep saying they weren’t friends anymore,. Etc.. how do you approach someone who resents the thing u guys started, won’t collab, says this stuff when u feel the friendship is struggling..but u never thought the friendship is dead? Feeling disappointed is not the same as resentment,  Anthony does need to cry because it shows he is apologizing for losing so much faith in heir friendship.  “i crieed cause i realized my old friend was still there”  He was always there. And he suffered on a sinking ship waiting for you. Ian is truly and amazing friend.
would love to see I Spent A Day With with the rest of the Smosh cast members, think it'd be cool to get a deeper insight into their lives & careers in this kinda context
EPIC FOOD BATTLES!!!!!
ian ! anthony! i was indeed that child who probably wasn’t supposed to be watching you ! i’m now 23 and seeing you both so mature and happy , fulfilled finally made my heart fill with joy 💓 i’m so happy you both have healed so much ! it might be early and this might be one of the things you both hated as i realized usually you guys would take one bite and rate the food and leave but please maybe think about being back lunchtime w smosh ? as it was the journey ordering the food with you guys being so relatable with you both having such bad social anxiety at the time lol & laughing along with you guys on the way to get the food. it truly fixed my ED as a youngster and i feel like that’s something that would heal me a bit now as well as i am now struggling again with that but please feel no pressure and just do what makes you guys happy as i’m just happy see you guys both together on screen again  saying ‘ smosh ‘
I want you two to go on joe rogan
I wonder if Patrick is coming back for the spanish version of smosh
SHUT UP
Smosh the good ending ^
i had goosebumps the entire time i watched this video, could not be happier for you guys
Drinking game: take a drink every time Ian says “like”
I had a hard time trying to stay watching Smosh when you left, Anthony. It just didn't feel right without you there. But now I think I'll be able to watch Smosh again.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
The boys are back together and my heart is full. I got my pizza place hoodie in today, just in time for the new era 🤍
Let's face it, we've waited for him to interview, Ian haven't we?
Broo food battle will be back😮😮
the world is healing. finally.
I will say, I don’t think Ian gets enough credit for stepping up, holding down the fort, and keeping Smosh alive over the years. It shows how much he loves Smosh and it’s his baby and he’ll keep it going.
1:11:32 😭🥺 See, nah, my heart can't take it.  Ya'll can't do anything but absolutely well now.
Glad to see you guys back together and smosh coming back! It'd awesome to come back with food battles as a thing.
Viva la dirt league did it by make a kickstarter and fundraisers
You know what would be insane!!! A food wars come back 😂
ghetto smosh
I was early to You Tube, even though most creators were half my age or so! (I'm 62 now) I watched Smosh because you two had such joy on screen and it was feel good content. I watched the whole "break up"'and Anthony trying different formats until he landed where he is now. I love his interviews and feel like they help so many people- plus some of them are fun- and all are interesting. Seeing you two own Smosh again, and hearing that Rhett and Link had a super helpful part in it makes me so happy. They are great guys and I've also watched them for years and years. (I don't do Netflix or TV at all! Just You Tube.) Anyway, congratulations on your new direction and that your friendship is in a healthy place again. I wish you two all the best!
I am now going to google milk fanfic
Ian talking about he" losing his emotions  " he sounds so tired . I feel even in this interview he doesn't really feel vibrant if that makes sense I think ian needs a very very long vacation and some praise for being the person that clinged onto smosh for us the viewers
Im high as shit rn but I still notice them being censored, not the fully story they keep holding back i havent finished the whole thing just wanted to comment before i forget lmao
This is pure YT. And the reason why I felt in love with it in the first place. What a journey!
aas an OG smosh fan this is so sick
15:42
My mom yelled at me once as a kid for watching smosh 💀
i love how real they are being in this its sop refreshing to see
what if you guys did food battle again
my goodness, this almost feels like the finale of a beautiful coming of age story
Good battle 2023 plz
As a kid I remember watching smosh the movie with all my friends and we rewatched it like 20 times 🤣
🥹🥹🥹
I have watched both channels consistently for years and I never expected this to happen
i never cared about influencers but this touched me. i hope you guys can achieve what you looking for. if will burn it to the ground, i'm happy to be there with you guys.
I love you guys, thank you for making me smile in my late childhood
Ngl….I had a tramadol, post-surgery induced dream a few weeks ago about Anthony coming back to Smosh. I’m not going to say I manifested this for the rest of the world, but maybe….   In all seriousness though, this has been such a beautiful, vulnerable conversation to watch between two old friends who are both willing to share their mistakes and rebuild their friendship. Kudos to both of you! ❤️
Honestly, Anthonys solo career before the interviews was underrated. Especially the Tennessee Luke Era of it lol
hi smosh do you remeber me i commented on your video a long time ago
The milk fanfiction?
ians outfit is amazing
Just the other day I was thinking… “it’s so sad I wasn’t around for OG smosh….” Two days later…my wish came true
They seem really good together they should have done this years ago
@wildtechtv
bro just spent a day with his old high school friend
I was crying by the end of this video 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ this made me so happy.
All we need now is Nigahiga back
food battle 2023?
I am crying.
My heart is so full watching all these videos. I said I was not going to cry and I have multiple times but in the best possible way.
They are literally soul mates lol❤🥺
I go away from yt for  one day and this happens? WHY AM I A DAY LATE FOR THIS DAY WHY cmon
Wuuut?! They got smosh back?
I did NOT expect to hear a reference to the milk fic at the end of this video lmaoooo 💀
I remember the Dixon Cider was the last smosh video i truly enjoyed. After that, I didn't enjoy their videos and I thought "I must be getting older and my sense of humor was changing." I'm glad that i was wrong
Goats
Next please do "I spent a day with SCHLATT"
I feel like we need a Smosh Podcast now. Loved hearing you both talking like this.
Beautiful reunion!
Anthony leaving smosh was like a canon event that had to happen HAHAHAH
our childhood heroes
I hope for food battle
I met my best friend in 4th grade because he was wearing a smosh shirt, We’re 23 now and it’s been a crazy ride
Ok, I don’t do membership payments on ANY channel period. But if supporting these two guys with a membership allows them to create content together again, I’m DOWN 100%. Love to see these two together again
They really defined the YouTube we all know today. Truly pioneers of internet culture and even thought I haven't watched a Smosh video in almost a decade I will always have love for these two for helping make me a fan of this site in the first place.
last time smosh was together i was worried about the next food battle, now im worried about gas prices
Been Subscribed since 2007 was a very nice video to see
It’s amazing how much growth you can achieve when you let go of the bowl cut
Dixon Cider 😍😍😍😍
i’m literally crying right now
Ngl I cried watching this. It's always great to see grown men being vulnerable and kind and reconnect. It's even better because smosh means so much to me.
I dont wana say it but Ian was having awkward moments like he was choosing very carefully what to say and what not to say
late to work today bc i had to take some time to sit still and think after i saw this video. i was brought up on smosh, was there when you decided to go your separate ways, stayed around when you each were coming up with your own things (that i’m both a fan of), and now i’m here when you guys are back together again. and it’s really interesting to hear the more personal side of everything that went down for you guys to finally come to this point. what a happy occasion. truly wishing you guys the best.
Open a Patreon?!
FINALLY something good happening in the world. Been here for OG Smosh. You guys being together again gives out the best vibes. Now to get back Jenna Marbles xD
If I hear shut up I'm going bananas
I cried like a baby when Anthony shed tears, it was so close to home. Its like finding these 2 guys again as the exact guys i watched almost 20 years ago, even life and we all have changed so much.
,,
I think a big part of the magic you guys had was not just the sketch comedy, but also just seeing you two hanging out and kind of riffing off each other, unscripted. I remember Lunchtime with Smosh being my favorite thing that I watched consistently from you guys. If there was any tension between you two at the time, I had no idea. But anyway, the scripted stuff was really funny too and I hope maybe you'll do a little of both? Whatever you have the most fun doing, that's the important thing. That's another part of your old videos I loved - it just looked like you were having so much fun. I agree with Ian that your friendship was the foundation of everything. Of course it's not always easy when business is mixed in with friendship, but now that you own Smosh and have both separated and come back together, you've grown so much that you'll be able to work things out and have a stronger bond than you ever had in the past.  Also Anthony, I think you having left Smosh for that time was the best thing you could have done, not only for yourself but for the world. The interviews you did gave voices to people who didn't always get a platform, and the empathy and humor you showed rivals Oprah and Larry King. You opened my mind for sure.
I’m so happy it’s not even funny
I for one, am really excited for the first classic style smosh video!
I really, really miss seeing this side of Ian.
This is honestly the only video i've ever given a like to. I couldn't have loved to see a video pop up on my page more!
Wow, I never expected this to happen but It’s a nice surprise
it was all a canon event
Oh my goodness it's Hal and Bubbles from The Angry Birds Movie
It’s interesting cause Ian is more reserved with his feelings.. vs Anthony blurting they weren’t really friends.. but Ian seems hesitant to agree.. meaning Anthony was reading things a bit wrong.. and Ian really didn’t feel as negative to the situation as Anthony,,
It’s almost June 30th a year after the heartbreaking passing of Alex aka Technoblade.  Anthony, I think a lot of people would love closure, if you could interview Mister Technodad, ask him about Alex’s journey and how he will carry on Alex’s legacy? That would be really awesome.
Seeing you guys come back together is like the world literally healing, i actually hope this year is a year of peace, people expanding on themselves, dude your videos were and still are the best
this is healing my inner child
Couple's therapy ❤❤❤
i’m so excited to see what’s to come 🤍🤍🤍 i missed yall
I'm still at the beginning of the video, but hey guys, I thoroughly enjoyed the Smosh movie! And ghostmates! And I was a full grown adult when I watched them
Surprised there was no discussion about the current Smosh cast and how hard their unscripted content has carried for the last 6 years. They deserve massive props for everything they’ve done and shouldn’t be forgotten about just because Anthony is back now
Who's playing Anthony in the movie?
I am so happy for you both! :D I already joined lol
I miss ian is bored
i am gonna watch every single videos about smosh getting back and never skip a single upload from smosh like i used to before.
Congratulations boys! I used to watch back in 2012 when you would post going to fast food places in the morning and posting vlogs eating them. Good to see the boys owning Smosh again.
Maybe I shouldn't comment before finishing the video. But this is everything! There's so many smosh videos I cried laughing to. Golden era YT. You were such a big part of that. ❤ This is so far like watching two grown ups rekindling something special like healing, honest, confessional. It's making me feel like it's also time for me to do the same thing. Thank you for the upload ❤
Please dont bring Stevie back.
Return of the legends
Anthony tearing up talking about their friendship reconnecting and what made their original friendship special got to me. I'm so happy to see these two together again.
I love this for you two ❤
When I was 12/13 my buddy and I we're massive Smosh fans. At sleepovers we used to watch the videos on repeat late at night in our basements, trying desperately to contain our laughter so our parents wouldn't wake up and give us hell. Eventually this evolved into trying to make our own "comedy" skits. Filming with a shitty digital camera, we howled with laughter trying to think up new scenes and lines. When we finally finished we would grab some Tim Hortons or something and my buddy would attentively edit the clips for hours on end in Windows Movie Maker while I peered over his shoulder eating a doughnut. Even though the videos were obviously terrible and unfunny, I'll still never forget the bond and incredible optimism and excitement for the future that came from working on and creating something together. I'll always remember feeling this kind of sudden self awareness that we were very young and that that meant the future could hold quite literally anything for us. What a profound feeling to recognize that we were just starting to explore the galaxy of life ahead.   We had a pretty bad falling out somewhere in our late teens, and we hated each other for a while. It was over a girl or something, the sad thing is that I honestly can't fully remember. It was genuinely harder for me than any breakup I've been through. He was the best friend I ever had.   As I've grown older, I haven't really paid much attention to anything Smosh for years , but this video had me smiling like crazy. Like an insane amount. I even felt the same sort of childhood joy I felt back then with my buddy. It's nice to see two people who were once extremely close but have drifted apart find each other again and newly discover the things that made them such close friends in the first place. It gives me hope that maybe one day me and my old best friend can reconnect. Maybe we'll even make a sketch.
Good to see that you two are doing better. I think this is a great thing for the new generation to see too. Thanks for uploading this sensitive video!
These guys fr made my my childhood I thank y’all for that
Aight Aight now hear me out! New music video with I Set My Friends On Fire!
I’m so happy they were able to have this conversation together, on camera or not, it’s beautiful to know they were able to reconnect and move forward knowing how the other feels.
I miss Lunchtime with Smosh so much!!
Remember guys its gonna be new stuff! might be some references to older stuff but old smosh will never be again if you wanna watch a food battle go watch a food battle lmao
Feel sad
Am I having deja vu? Didn't Anthony do a interview with Ian already? Not that I'm complaining
Bruh this is a whole new level of healing for me.  As someone who has watched Smosh from damn near the start, watched it 'fall apart', grown up and lived a lot of my life.. now I get to watch it come back together better than ever.  I can't even explain the happiness and nostalgia I feel.  This is probably the most I've paid attention to any YouTube video in a LONG time.  I love you guys, and CONGRATULATIONS!!!
I really miss ........ SHUUUT UUUUP!!!
I'm not crying... you're crying!
I’m crying
My Childhood😭😭😭
FOOD BATTLE !!!!!!
I still listen to their old music and whenever it comes on while I’m driving I sing every word. I needed them in my life again ❤
Seriously they were my first YouTube channel i actually loved to watch. I learned to speak English by watching you two
I want to watch the og content now.
oh wow , had no idea that Rhett and Link helped out like that 🥺💕
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS SO EXCITING! This strong ability to be on the same page creatively and this reunion is so special. Also so much class that Rhett and Link have to be so on board immediately to letting them own smosh again. I’m so excited!!
Watching the 2 of you smile and laugh together again is so heartwarming!! Congratulations guys!! ❤
Tears.😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I see the spark in their eyes.  They want this.  Life can be hard.  I'm happy to see the joy restored in them.
You only know the light when it is burning low, this is one of the rare times it has returned.
Smosh to me (until I came back to it in the last few years) was all about Pokémon IRL, Lunchtime with Smosh, and CANNON PEEEEEEEEENIS. I think that was before or VERY early defy maybe? You guys were definitely still in Sacramento. And then I think I did feel the passion go and it became SOOOOOOOO generic (I never liked every (blank) ever tbh...) and I left... Honestly? TNTL brought me back and then some of the games content and the shows that were definitely the machinations of Sarah Whittle. I'm glad daddy came back. Now will you two make a new legend of Zelda video? The time is NOW! well actually.... It won't be by post production....
Food battle 2023 here we go. 🎉🎉
FINE ill go back and watch every smosh video AGAIN
Now that you're together with Smosh again it's time for I spent a day with I Set My Friends on Fire.
I appreciate a refresh entirely but also there was absolutely nothing wrong with Lunchtime With Smosh and I want it back ,_,
this is like when shaq and kobe sat down to talk.
This video was such a  emotional rollercoaster. Tearing up, laughing, being deep in thoughts, giggling. I am sooo excited for you two, for the company and people involved and for us watching you 😊
Did anyone else start crying? I just turned 28 and was watching Smosh at 14. This whole conversation and video just really hit home. It’s crazy how time flies. Reminded me of the good old days. Made me feel very nostalgic. Made me miss my old best friend. Looking forward to the future of Smosh 🖤
Guess iv gotta go  find out what the milk fic now
FOOD BATTLE 2023 IS COMING!!!
Why do I feel like Rhett & Link needs a talk like this 😂 The Intervention
When I first got into you two I was literally 10. Now I'm 23 and I cannot be more happy Smosh, as I knew it, is fucking back. I love you guys, no matter what this ends up being. You literally are my childhood.
I’ve watched y’all since I was 10 and to see y’all back together at 20 makes me so happy, I wish y’all the best. I also wanted to just add that I could 100% see this story being made into a happy ending biopic 10/10 would watch over and over again!!!
One of the best youtube partnerships
The chaotic boys of 2005 having a mature heart to heart as adults? This is the “growing with the audience” I’m here for.
Sounds kinda dumb but I really hope smosh gets huge again and becomes the standard again for content for younger viewers. I hate a lot of the garbage that gets sent to get attention and it feels like a lot of creators disregard the viewer for profit. Hopefully this turns around that type of content from thriving so much
I literally just ran across Smosh a couple of weeks ago. I've had a youtube for years but just recently started posting my husband's dnd figures and browsing around while stuff uploaded. I'm enjoying years of footage and looking forward to the new / old era!
CAN WE BRING BACK THE "SHUT UP" INTROS
I have never seen a single piece of Smosh content. I knew Anthony was from Smosh when I started watching his channel, so I knew where he came from. So, this was one of the most heartbreaking episodes. I'm happy that the boys are back. Much love to Anthony and Ian. ❤❤❤
I am SO GLAD you guys aired this sh*t out. There was a lot that needed to be addressed, and I am so honored you shared this with us. Here's to the NEW SMOSH, FOLKS!!! 🍻🎉
Been waiting for this since day one
It's going to go well. It's going to go well. You guys are OGs. You can absolutely do this.
no hate but im so excited for smosh to be funny again lol
So basically....a LUNCHTIME WITH SMOSH SAVED SMOSH
love this for you guys and happy to see the journey go this way
But can we bring back pink frosted sprinkle donuts in an updated Food Battle? 😳
Truly healing yourselves and others. Appreciate u guys
My heart feels so full seeing these two talk together again :). Not just as Smosh, but also as childhood friends.
I don't know if Anthony or Ian are going to read this, but this conversation just made my day. I'm 33 years old and I watch your videos since the beginning. I'm a huge fan from Chile. I cried a little bit when Ian said that a lot of people grew up with you, because it's true! And I'm so happy for your news about Smoh and for your personal journey to get to this point. Thank you for sharing this honest conversation. Love you guys! ❤
Rhett and Link are so nice! Just 2 really good souls. The GOATS for sure! Welcome back Smosh! Can’t wait!
Potential for a Boxman 3.0! 🎉
fucking finally
people in the back laughing in the bloopers makes it so obvious that they're funny together
Wait when did Anthony rejoin Smosh 😲! I stopped watching that channel like 2 years ago
I’m a 22 y/o and I did not cry during this video
This interview had everything I ever wanted. For the longest time, as an oblivious naive kid, I always wondered how and why those things happened at Smosh. Especially with what had happened between Anthony and Ian. When Anthony announced he was leaving, I just didn't get it. I was left with so many questions. I wasn't very socially acclimated, and I didn't really understand how these businesses worked.  Fast forward through the years to last July, when Anthony was a guest on the Trash Taste podcast, he discussed their upbringing during the early Smosh days, and his experiences and gripes with Defy media, and why he ultimately left. I came out of that video with a new perspective on everything. Yet, I still had questions about the relationship of what had happened between Anthony and Ian. And man, this video delivered. Them being as vulnerable and as transparent as they were here, legitimately got me teary eyed for a moment. Not only was I graced with the nostalgia of them just simply, being together on camera, once again --but watching them discuss how they broke the ice about everything that happened between them was just so moving. As dudes, I feel like we often do a bad job at communicating transparently amongst each other, on certain things, and they showed us just that.   I'm glad you guys are close again :)
I would totally pay for a membership if I get the old duo and and great sketches
The good ending! I hated the idea of watching something I loved so much since I was 7 dwindle away. I'm glad the Kings are back!!
Commenting bc idk what my handle is but I loved this video
Anthony was Ice Cube and Ian was Dr. Dre.
First its alex and wasabi now its anthony and ian
I didn't start watching smosh until about 5 months ago. I had heard of smosh before but for some reason I just never watched any of their content. I randomly came across a good mythical morning video about 8 months ago and started watching all of their content. I then found the try not to laugh video that they were a part of and I decided to finally check the channel out and I ended up loving it. it feels weird for me that this reunion is happening because I've never seen a smosh video with anthony. even though I knew he used to be a part of smosh, as well as other people (mainly the old games channel people),  just preferred to watch the videos with people who were still a part of smosh.  with that being said, I am genuinely very excited to see the content they'll be creating and am glad they've gotten back control of their internet baby
You guys should apologize for Oishi Highschool Battle
PAPA CAME BACK FROM THE STORE! HE. GOT. THE. MILK. IT TOOK HIM SOME YEARS, BUT HE GOT THE MILK AND THE CIGARETTES AND NOW WE CAN ALL BE A FAMILY AGAIN
YEARS ago when I watched Anthony's video saying he was leaving I never thought I'd see the day but now it's here and I'm so glad it is ❤
i cannot explain how special this is to me. i grew up watching hours and hours of smosh, i had all the merch, i was insufferable. to see both of you together and talking about smosh is so special. so much love, respect and support to both of you. ❤
This channel is for Anthony the philosopher and now Smosh will have Tony the Kidder back :D
holy fuck im so happy <3
Id smosh anthony so hard
This video just blew my mind!🤯 that being said, much love to Rhett & Link!!!❤
Lunchtime with Smosh or what??
My inner child is sobbing
Food battle 2023🎉
The collab my inner child needed 🥹
Ahem... SHUT UP!!
I’d love to see BTS for the first sketch y’all reunited for. This is a NEED
New Lore: Anthonly loves Ian's mom so much cuz she secretly made the card
Why does the world have to be the way it is? These two obviously want to be bffs but the world just had to get between them. Their synergy is something I've only rarely experienced with other people. If you find someone where you can only describe your work together as "magic", cherish that person. I knew exactly that feeling for segmented periods of time, and they made up my best days, and there are more best days ahead.
I never thought you guys will be together again. I am so happy for you boys. I hope your Smosh channel will be successful and will reach new heights <3. I am waiting for new content impatiently. Huge love from Lithuania <3
i wonder if they saw the fanfic i wrote about them... probably not. it was super tame lol
I’m so glad they are back together but I feel like they shouldn’t have had to pay to get smosh back it’s rightfully theirs to begin with
this is very important to internet culture
I remember in elementary school going into middle school I would get home every Friday and be so excited to have a new Smosh upload to be able to watch, I would watch lunchtime with Smosh on the weekends while eating whatever grub I had. This is everything I’ve ever wanted.
SMOSH was my childhood. Anthony and Ian are the people that inspired my passion for comedy and writing, and to see my favorite channel on YouTube getting the ending it deserves evokes emotions I didn’t even know existed. I am so happy for you too and I cannot wait for the sketches you have in store. Thank you for being yourselves, and for being SMOSH❤
"Even if it doesn't do well, I know it's the right thing. And if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you."  E P I C.
I did notice Ian change over the years, you could see how he sorda felt about anthony whenever his name was mentioned (sketches, podcasts, etc). Happy you guys were able to reconnect, can’t believe I saw Smosh change so much in the last 15 years.
This is damned beautiful
So does this mean... Finally... After Years... WE ARE GOING TO GET SMOSH FOOD BATTLE 2023!!!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
Y'all are incredibly mature and I'm so glad yall were allowed to grow and have this opportunity of doing things how you want again as one of the people who sort of grew up on smosh (I started washing on and off since I was 13 back in 2013) it's so nostalgic and I'm glad to see it I think you both will do good things
SMOSH was made the same day i was born lmao thats mad
Legends! Prob the first YouTube channel I subscribe to in YouTube. Huge part on my childhood. Learned I flush thru you guys and had such great memories. Thank you so much !
Periods suck, and commas rule 🤭 So happy for you boys!
ian, anthony, if either of you read this at all then bring up the possibility of couples therapy together. it sounds like a joke but I'm serious, doing therapy together and putting all grievances in the air with a PROFESSIONAL present is so incredibly helpful if you have access
Im glad they had this "hash it out" interview. I dont think viewers would have been as passionate of them getting back together without knowing the inside. Even though we could read between the lines. Now im pumped to see them let the craziness out!! And hopw the old/new cast stay in cause i need them alllllll!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
THE MILK FANFIC IAN OMG
NOT THEM KNOWING THE MILK FANFIC LMFAOOOOO
We are in the good timeline
To be honest I was happy to see Anthony branch off on his own and try stuff and I enjoyed them. Him and Ian growing as people is very heart warming, and honestly struggle with people and mental and or emotional barriers so hearing them talk about them makes me realize I got to find a way past mine.
ian and anthony have managed to be so fucking cool in two completely different eras
Nostalgia 100
The good ending.
Vanilla milk fan fic?
best thing ever
Do the "6 feet apart cuz we're not gay" again
I'm back in the good timeline
These 2 would make a really good comedy duo
im crying
butterfly ahhhh effect lol
no more "oh it's the hot and funny duo" jokes, it's "oh it's the emo and dissociative duo" from now on
im sobbing so hard, i’m so happy 😭😭😭💖💖💖💖🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This has been a delight to watch, feels honest and wholesome, I feel great for you guys, here´s to many more years of success for SMOSH and everyone involved, Cheers!!
This singlehandedly cured my depression.
This makes my heart so full of happiness. It feels like a piece of me has been restored. I have missed these two together so much. The only thing missing now is the O.G games crew 😂 JK I know their on to bigger and better things ❤
I knew the moment mykie posted announcing they were together that smoosh would be back Ina. Couple years! I was MF correct and when he started talking about mykie I verbally said “ I KNEW IT I KNEW IT I KNEW IT I KNEW IT”
❤
can we get a ian like counter lol
This journey was the real Smosh movie ❤❤
"Even if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you." is the right attitude to have about this. I was an early smosh subscruber, fell out of watching for many years, and then came back around again when Mythical bought it, so it's cool to see it coming full circle.
Shut up everybody it’s happening!!!!!
the world is healing
so so so happy for the both of you!!! and so impressed by all of the growth!!! keep going being yourselves, i’m glad you both are able to be yourselves with each other again. a pre-parent company smosh video was the first video i ever watched on youtube. thank you for sharing your story!!!!!
Only happy thing I have in my heart right with my life in turmoil, now is you boys <3 You two were my biggest crushes ever and still are. I wish you both nothing but good things and success. I am so happy for you guys. I still have my smosh hoodies. TOMOHAWK CHOP IS MY DEATH BLOW.
When Ian said he would be willing to burn it to the ground with Anthony, that really surprised me too. I don't think I ever perceived Ian as being more chilled out or distant until watching this video, you can't tell in any of the more comedic vids. So it was nice to see that warmth from him, judging from Anthony's reaction I think he felt the same way.
Me personally I fw the movie🤷‍♂️
Goatse or blue waffle is less bad than the milk fanfic? Well, guess i know what I'm doing tonight... 😂 🥛
9:23 that’s literally what I did when I was 7 years old and now I’m 19.
This is so epic.
Guys, I'm so excited for this return, but why did you mention THAT fic?
I kid you not a got an ad for a place called “Milk and Honey” after they were talking about the milk fanfic 😂
Smosh was a big part of my childhood to early teens ish entertainment. Lots of laughs and good times had with smosh, and I almost cried when I saw this video.🎉 Congrats Ian & Anthony! Looking forward to what you guys put out!
I grew up with smosh and I'm SO excited for you guys
that's a genuine happiness
Food Battle 2023?
dude can they just make out already ive been waiting since 2008
Now this is two men who’ve done therapy it’s refreshing
FOOD BATTLE 2023 COMING????
Where’s Anthony?
I want to see the behind the scenes from when this was announced to the SMOSH team! The reactions were probably wild!
So the return of shut up cartoons as well?
This feels like the kind of thing that sould happen with Star Wars and Disney.  Edit: I mean George Lucas freeing Star Wars (and Lucasart) from Darth Kennedius’ influence.
It’s hard to hear you weren’t friends at points but also validating bc that’s how life is
Literally, this had to happen. This past weekend, I caught up on Anthony's "Day With" series and thought to myself "I wish he'd have Ian on the show". Same weekend, my bf was talking to a buddy about Smosh. THEN THIS HAPPENED. Meant to be. We're healing.
Don't need anything from old Smosh other that food battle, at least one last one if you don't want to bring it back more than that
How a Smosh video is made: 1. Ian: "This is a really stupid idea, but..." 2. Anthony: "Give it to me!" 3. ? 4: Profit!
Forgot to mention ghetto smosh 😢
this gives similar energy to the slo mo guys reconnecting after the pandemic
BRING BACK FOOOOOOOD BATTLE!!!!!!!!!!
This video should be titled we spent a day with Smosh
Watching these two comeback and rekindled their friendship is really sweet and wholesome. And knowing they are going to be back making sketches again is really cool. My best friend that I've known for almost 20 years since we were kids. Watching Smosh in early middle school was really fun and awesome especially they were putting videos out consistently. it might be nostalgic but i hope its original sketches they put out.
Does this mean food battle is returning?
Anthony falling in love with Siri and ian getting jealous still peak mid 2000s
It’s so amazing to see all the things discussed with defy and the relationship between you too throughout all of it. I am so happy for you both that you finally own your company, and wish you nothing but such happiness, fun, and laughter ❤
Why am I crying
i wonder how it will work. i dunno cuz i do feel some pressure for you guys but at the same time do what you want to. You have the new generation of 2020 kids along with 2010s and 2000s kid that grew up with your skits. Comedy at its finest
wait wait... i thought they where married?
OH THE FAN FICTION IS COMING BACK!
Now I'm convinced we live in the best timeline.
Me: nostalgic but just wants them to be happy
Ian X Anthony  Logan Paul X KSI  Roi X Alex wasabi
Sellouts being sellouts
I remember being 9 and watching you’re deranged videos and now I’m 20 and so excited to watch more 😂😂
Bring back Boxman for us old folks just once lol
The reunion I didn't know I needed. T_T
I AM IN TEARS
Not Anthony and Ian having a whole therapy session on YouTube. Wouldn’t have it any other way. I love that for them 😂
10:03 as a 21 year old who grew up watching family guy and Simpsons as a kid every Sunday, I can totally understand why kids were drawn to Smosh because I know I definitely wasn’t the only kid that watched those shows. Regardless of it being very inappropriate, I had so many friends who also grew up watching adult cartoons. Idk that’s just my theory, kids are appealed by flashy things, high energy, and jokes they can’t quite grasp. It’s actually pretty normal.
2.2 million views already?
This was the best anime of 2023
1:00:32 Smosh has had an impact on me as I've grown up in MORE than a weird way - it's just....light! In what can often be really dark times! And I want to say a HUGE HUGE thank you to both of you - and everyone else at Smosh - for that one simple but immensely necessary fact!
This is a dream come true... seeing you two become friends again is a phenomenal example to the world. Just because something or someone leaves our lives doesnt mean its gone forever.
Ever wonder how many young actors today got inspired by smosh? Or atleast watched them. Probably quite many.
Drink a shot each time they say resentment/j (please joke)
I was not expecting these guys to name drop Refused.
😮❤ let’s goooo
It’s like an amateur boy band selling their brand to a bigger company
this is my new favorite movie
20:42
Truly, the beavis and butthead of our generation fr  congrats on buying smosh guys :D you’ve come so far !
They own SMOSH again!? Finally! I'm hoping the content is a lot better. I hated when they sold it, the content to me became lackluster. I like Rhett and Link, but idk, I feel under these 2 the comedy was way better.
these convos between you two are exactly why i started rewatching Lunchtime with Smosh last week! what a big surprise!!
I never cared for their content much, but this is absolutely amazing that they’re back together
IAN DOING THE FINGER GUN HAD ME DYING😭
As I approach 30 years old, knowing that I grew up with them end of middle school early high school, and seeing them come full circle makes me so happy. I’m so happy to see these sweet boys back together. ❤
"I have waited a long time for this moment..." -Palpatine
It was shocking to hear that their friendship was getting affected by Smosh and how it almost drove them apart, but it was also really great to hear how emotionally mature and intelligent they both are for understanding what was wrong and communicating it to each other. That's how deep friendships are formed and how they last
I’m shitting pissing and crying I’m so happy
Been here since I was 10 i am nearly 20 ❤
Dope
Smosh is back?! Let’s go!
He should have named this video I spent a day with smosh or I spent a day with my past
the way vids like this, the regrowth of d&p as mentally healthy adults, og youtube ppl having open conversations in general is so healing to my younger self who looked up to all of you who felt like she was in limbo — i almost can’t explain it but thank you
You can tell how much people wanted this, with the video on the main channel announcing they own smosh being 1 on trending, this being 2 and the try not to laugh with anthony being 7
lets gooooo
So Ian comes up with lots of ideas and he needs Anthony to help direct him in the right direction. What a good team.
I liked smosh the movie
What a beautiful thing to see yall connect again as fully grown and whole people. You needed to find each other again once you grew into your own, and I'm so glad to see yall together again. I believe yall to be soul mates it's so easy to see and I knew one day yall would find each other again. Can't wait to see what yall do together! So happy for your friendship
“You know?” lol missed smosh so much
I just realized today, but why doesn’t Ian have a Wikipedia page 😂 that’s highkey disrespectful
Anthony: and our friendship started deteoriating as well-  Ian: What friendship?   Had me cracking up. This was such a great video and not only allowed us fans to understand what went on behind the scenes but the fact you shared with us details you didn't have to is nice. I'm so glad for you guys!
I am happy to see what can become of them together. I look forward to Smosh and I went back and refollowed Smosh for what is to come. However, I feel a lot of... offness? with this interview. Is anyone else picking up more negativity or less interest in Ian than with Anthony? It's just giving serious Happy!Anthony and LastResort!Ian. Does Ian even want to recreate Smosh with Anthony? Or is this the only way for Ian to make Smosh successful again? I don't know, I'm not feeling they have the same level of positivity for this. Which is unfortunate. I hope I'm reading it wrong.
The timing of this is so great for me, as I myself just reconnected with an old friend and rekindled that spark. So many things said in this really hit close to my own situation; it makes me emotional for these two as well as for myself. It's crazy how randomly reaching out on a whim can result in beautiful relationships between people.
Did anyone else cry while watching them talk about them writing together again
What the heck are feelings? I miss the old Smosh
*Starts the fanfic *
WE ARE SO BACK!
51:49 just make that a skit LMAO ian voiceing over (in his head) "geez why is this guy venting" no fr this is amazing
meal time w/ smosh and discussing paying mortgage 2023 lets gooooo
The two veterans reunite once more. Thank you guys for making my childhood
I demand a food battle 2023   Plz🥺
I felt like I was watching something private that I shouldn't be watching. Very cathartic video
Uploading this without warning was the best idea fkin ever
ok cool now re create that EPIC RAP BATTLES video with you guys, rhett and link (joking)
"And if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you" I was pouting when Anthony was tearing up when he realized he didn't lose Ian's friendship But NOW i am full-on crying cuz of that line Thanks Ian:') I'm so happy to see there's so much love between them. That's real friendship and it's beautiful❤  Congratulations once again guys🎉  can't wait to see what the future holds
I really like Ian saying “this had to happen” because he is so right. Smosh wouldn’t be alive today if Ian hadn’t stuck around and fought for it and there is no way Anthony would have recovered and healed had he stayed to fight for Smosh at the time. They both did what they had to do and without them taking those two very different paths this wouldn’t have been possible.
Ugh yall this was such a fantastic episode. I am absolutely thrilled for what is to come.
Anthony tearing up 😢😢
If it brings any consolation to you guys, literally every single one of my friends have been screaming about this. All we've said to each other is, "THE INTERNET IS HEALING, THE TIMELINE IS BEING RESTORED." We're so excited about this, and I know for a fact that thousands of other people are experiencing the same thing. I can't wait to see Anthony on SMOSH again :')))))
As someone who watched you guys since 2007..wow
Hearing Ian talk about his experience post-Anthony back at Smosh sucks, I seriously hope he was able to work through everything. That numbness that effected him and probably still does I genuinely it gets/has gotten better.
If smosh stays the same as OG great if it is something different I’ll still be happy because it would have evolved because of them not a company. Congrats guys 🎉
Coming into my mid-20s, I'm learning how to maintain adult friendships. Watching you two reminds me of my own childhood friendships that have always just...worked. I'm so fucking happy for you. It will he wonderful to come back to Smosh.
yes this video is very sweet. but i was reminded of the milk fic and now i have to go take a bath in holy water. my young teen self is crying.   but seriously i watched SMOSH a ton growing up and seeing it come back in my early adulthood is surreal
I freaking love you two for this. Raise hell in smosh!
I loved the lunchtime with smosh/ Ian is bored. FIRST BIIIYYYTE
well anthony…. you certainly proved to everyone that you could do it all by yourself ❤
I remember literally coming home from elementary school with my best friend, every Friday we’d literally dart straight to the family computer and watched the new smosh video My whole childhood was in this channel. I love you guys I hope the future of smosh is super successful guys. Looking forward to it
Soooooo no Food Battle 2023? It was for sure one of my favorite series hahaha
O.G. fan since food battles way back in the days. You have absolutely no idea how much this means to me. You guys were my full childhood and my embarrassing emo years. This is absolutely unreal. Still trying to get my head around it. My warmest and nostalgic feelings to you guys. SHUT UP!!! ❤
Es como el episodio de Yordi Rosado con Adal Ramones pero en gringo jajajsjsjsj
This is like an early 21st birthday present 🥲
So happy Anthony and Ian are back! It’s crazy growing up watching smosh, and following what all the smosh channels and Anthony were doing over the years. All to have everything come full circle. I love who you guys have become, and I’m excited to see what comes next!!
I thought I would love this but it is bittersweat, not from anything they do but because I had a childhood friend(my only one) who I liked and once we got into middle school I bullied him and he was a year younger. He never blamed me or even acknowledged it but what I did was effed up. He did YouTube and and was slowly gaining popularity as he was such a genuine person, except one thing he only told me, but then he died. I heard the news processed  it on a walk I walked for hours. Then thought I was over it. I did try YouTube and twitch at once point to kind of have him live on thru me and cause it seemed cool, and I would enjoy doing it. But I failed at it and gave up. I thought  I was over him as a person but this showed me I'm not and I'm not connecting  with others because I'm afraid and scared but I got to try to be better for him so I appreciate this video. I am only posting this as I need to vent to the world, and I know no one will see this and it would never blow up and get me likes. So its just a way of screaming into the void. Smosh made me come to this realization edit: I can never get closer with him as his dead and I'm not good enough to carry on his memory
Love this
holy omg. stopped watching smosh, now im back. cant wait to see what you do next. would love to see you guys go on COLD ONES. I know ians already been on but imagine if you went on together
A piece of my childhood that I thought was gone forever has officially come back. I am so happy!
Next Food Wars?
Two guys chilling in a hot tub…five feet apart cause there not gay ❤❤❤❤ best Anthony vibe ever and I love seeing Ian back❤
Thank you. Thank you for just an honest explanation and sit down for your viewers.
I can't tell if this whole thing was a one big skit or actually real lmao. If it is a skit it's fucking genius because I watched the whole fucking thing.
I hope you guys continue a format like this. Podcast would be really insightful of who you both really are, which is a side I didn’t see when I was kid first watching you two on YouTube. Regardless, happy to see you both back together. You two were a big part of my child and I’m sure a lot more
It's a bit weird that this feels like a happy ending while it is actually a happy beginning !
The duel OF might be a good monetization strategy
My heart is full
now i have hope that food battles come back
Omg mailtime with smosh bring that back
I really hope they make at least one more Food Battle🥲
Ian didn’t even remember that card and that card meant so much to Anthony even all these years later he needed to mention it. It just goes to show you can think you are useless in the world but your little actions might have a huge impact on people that you aren’t even aware of.
I honestly love this with my whole heart, I been hoping and wishing for them to be together again, from someone who stop watching smosh after the split really hope it brings be back in. can’t wait to see what happens no matter what happy you own what is yours again and best for y’all life
im so excited for this i wish you both nothing but success
Lunch time with smosh please?
NOT THE MILK FANFIC 😭
Let's give Rhett and Link their flowers for keeping Smosh alive the last few years and of course Ian for never wavering
Smosh is such a big part of my early teenage years! ❤
I don't think anyone was expecting this, but it feels like it was always meant to happen
I've commented at least 10 times about doing a day with Ian Lol I can't believe it happened and they're back together too
I loved this so much. Feel like piece of me is back together after all these years. Can't wait to support you guys!! Love you guys and what you do!!   This is what growth looks like and I love every minute!
canon events really are true
i wish the title can be "Spent All Day with Ian Hecox❤
You've spent many days with Ian Hecox :P
12:15 -- @Ian @Anthony @Smosh...  DO NOT downplay what you did! When you joined YouTube, it was just in the "MVP" stage. Your channel was one of ~10 at the time that truly helped validate the vision YouTube had. Fast forward to today, yep...y'all were right.  You had your wins, your losses, and "the breakup"...but c'mon...you guys did just about as well as ANYONE could navigating the (brand new) environment that you helped create. Kudos x1,307,441,221.  SO FUCKING HAPPY TO SEE YOU GUYS WORKING TOGETHER AGAIN
my favorite part of “old smosh” was the behind the scenes and Ian is bored/mail. that’s what made me also love the current content. it’s human. improv. . it has always been about you twos characters and the ability to bounce off each other. I’m excited to see where this goes.
i love smosh ❤
So when is foodbattle 2023?
Oh thank god the sacrifices finally paid off
I have been WAITING and hoping for this episode, omg. its so good to see you two together again and that your guys' friendship has rekindled, that's awesome! also, not only its good to hear you two being friends again, but Anthony is returning to Smosh and it will be owned by you guys again?? BEST news I've heard in awhile, as someone who's spent their entire teenage years for the most part watching Smosh and loved seeing your friendship. SO happy for you two!
So excited for all of this. I loved smosh at 12 and even at 24 I will still go back and watch videos. My favorites were Pokémon in real life, boxman has a girlfriend, milky milkshake and link rap battle. So happy to see this! Excited for what’s to come
this is honestly beautiful. what a heartfelt and earnest reckoning between two estranged friends
I started watching Smosh when I was 12 and I followed Anthony out but holy shit am I excited to see what Smosh can be again. I resubscribed immediately on announcement I'm so excited for this.
Are we getting a Food Battle 2023??
I’m an oldie from the beginning days of smosh. Your dynamic during the final days of smosh kind of remind me of brothers in a dysfunctional family. I’m glad you guys have come to this point❤
This is a Canon event
This made my year. I started watching you guys (and fell in LOVE with your content) as a junior in high school in 2006. This feels like a real full circle moment for us OGs. Super excited to see what's in store.
Can you guys shoot at barrels in low motion again ? 😂🤣
It’s one thing to understand people, but it’s another to make them laugh and smile. Smiling and laughter heals, it makes life better, and you two are going to make a lot of people do both.  After hearing the reasons and what you two are going after, I am absolutely pumped. I saw that “Ian misses the old Smosh” video for the first time today and the comments are basically pointing to the same conclusion. We have all missed you two, the genuine Smosh.  What makes me even more excited is the prospect of less filtered content, this is a breath of fresh air in a sterile corporate digital landscape, and we all need a little silliness in our lives.  I cannot wait to see what you do!
Enough to make a grown man cry
I got my best friend because in school we randomly chose to sit next to eachother, and our last names are right next to eachother so we always got next to eachoter in stuff.
Soo, did the people at Smosh find out via e-mail about Anthony and Ian buying the company, or...?
Re-collaberation
love the smosh succession years recap
the world is healing
I thought smosh the movie was dope as fuck tbh
Ian is right this needed to happen. Smosh lost its identity years ago when they added a whole new cast after anthony left. It gave those people (i dont even know their names thats why im not naming them) opportunity and it looked good on paper. Im glad they will still be on the gaming channels and smosh will be able to go back to its roots with ians mom calling her son a cuck
Anthony’s giggles at 51:40 are so precious 🥺😫 I’m so happy to see y’all reunited and growing ❤
You can see Ian was really heartbroken when Anthony left, I know how that feels, but I understand Anthony’s emotions.
Youtubers lately: Im going to take a break/leave my channel and stop making videos Anthony and Ian: WE'RE BRINGING SMOSH BACK BABY AND MAKING MORE VIDEOS  Y'all are insane with creativity. Cant wait to see! Loved watching SMOSH and lunchtime with smosh growing up. FIRST BIIITE
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
This is fascinating to me because even though I had heard of Smosh, I didn't get into Anthony until this "I spent a day with" series, and I didn't know much of anything about Smosh.
Ok but where's Boxman?
FIRST BITE! Couldn't be happier to see this and how you guys are genuinely happy. btw you should totally do a podcast. I hope Ian is getting back his confidence like he has in this video. it's so good to see the old videos and get excited for what is coming in the future. Just keep doing what you love and it's gonna come out great :)
im so happy, childhood is being restored, can still quote all the charlie the drunk guinea pig skits off by heart
The hair must return
Can’t wait for the epic food battle
This made my heart happy
Smosh was my adolescence... I loved it and still do... but honestly, the best era of smosh was the beginning... the low budget just Ian and Anthony content. When it started to get too "corporative" it lost it's genuine feeling.  I'm glad you two are opening out about the hardships and connecting with each other again... aside from what we as audience want, you two should always from now on prioritize your relationship and happiness 💜
I’m also from Fair Oaks CA and grew up on SMOSH I love this news
A proper title for this video would be, "We spent a day with Smosh."
I remember meeting Anthony at comedy club in LA one night. Had no clue he'd be there. I said hi and told him I was a big fan of Smosh. This was literally like a week before the announcement of the split. That was crazy.
A dream come true.
the way they’re making each other’s real laugh come out 😭
Lasagna
Can't believe you bought Smosh back. Way to go, guys 🎉
The Original Smosh.
pure happiness
Hate the demonitation bs
My inner child is happier now😭
I'm not saying this in a shippy way (I only got into Smosh after Mythical took over, so I'm genuinely new to their dynamic) but this whole thing is some real platonic soulmate shit, like that's a hell of a love story
FOOD WARS 2023 PLEASE, WE NEED IT
The prophecy has been restored
Anthony saying it was like realizing his friend was still there just 😭 but it also was the thought echoing in my head for the entirety of the Try Not To Laugh on the SmoshPit channel "its like the got their best friend back"
"If we burn it to the ground, i'm happy to do that with you". Damn, now im in.
Their friendship was basically the plot of Smosh: the movie, in real life.
do these guys know eachother or something
words can´t express the happiness i feel right now, you both are the GOAT and seeing you willing to hang out and work together again is an absolutely marvelous suprise! hope the best wishes for you both and have a blast in and out of work <3
These two guys are YouTube forgotten gods I love these guys miss them days of YouTube 🤧🤧🤧 these guys have matured alot more since their reunitement in this video
i watch rhett and link everyday    now and smosh everyday 10 years ago. this makes me so happy.
FRIENDSHIP ALWAYS WIN
This was lowkey a therapy session❤
And it comes full circle
Day 34 of asking for anthony to spend a day with paramedics
As a mexican dude, Smosh was one of the first channels that made me like the english language when I was a kid, and it also helped me to practice and understand a lot of "slang" used in the US
Like they said, it really feels like everything happened the way it was supposed to for Smosh to get to this point, and here we are in the best timeline
This is like the story between Drake and Josh except nobody's a child sex offender and we get a happy ending
I can also highly relate to the work/friend relationship. Same thing happened to ISMFOF. It’s not easy at all to mix those 2 at all. It gets weird really fast. The fact that they lasted that long with so much success is fucking incredible and I don’t think you guys realize that. These two are true legends!
What a crazy world, I'm 24 and these two were part of my childhood, but they look younger than me😂😂😂😂
you should do good Vs surprisingly good 2
Yall in no way need to keep your friendship intertwined with business you can balance it
MAN this Return to Classic Smosh arc is starting STRONG Love to see how much you guys grow but still works so well together.
Didn't realize I've had a knot in my stomach for the last 10 years knowing Anthony and Ian didn't own Smosh. Thank goodness that's gone!
Imagine not knowing SMOSH such a big part in my childhood 🥹
Q w Q ❤️ This is the best day ever.
I have been really, really hoping this would happen for years now but I have a lot of concerns. I have been a fan of Classic Smosh for over a decade. While the interview alleviated many of them. I have watched way too much YouTube since around 2008 and seen many channels rise fall. These are some of the biggest concerns I still have:  1. The new cast members being forced into the videos. I watched your videos because I wanted to see Ian and Anthony. I have never watched a video because I wanted to see Shawn or Courtney or any of the other cast members. I am back because Anthony and Ian are back together. This is the case for most of your fans of else your current views wouldn't be so much lower than your classic views. I don't mind if they are in there if they do it well and it is truly an Ian and Anthony video but, when I watch an Ian and Anthony video on the main Smosh channel. I want it to be a true to form Ian and Anthony video. I think this is by far the biggest concern I and most other fans have. I am worried that you two, Ian in particular, will have trouble doing this since you've known them for years and they're your friends and employees but please make this work.  2. Memberships. I just want you two to know that I, and some other fans, will be waiting a few months to see if this actually works or if it is just hot trash. If it actually works, I will definitely join and get a membership. I believe that many others will be in the same boat  3. Selling out. You guys sold out before and it didn't work out. A lot of the business stuff and the administration stuff or whatever that caused you to sell out can't have changed a lot or gone away in the last decade. What are you guys going to do when faced with this challenges again? I don't want you guys to sell out again or give up. I have never seen a channel that doesn't go to garbage after selling out and I have watched YouTube for over 15 years. I don't know if you two can handle it now or you have some sort of strategy to deal with it but I want to mention how a channel called Linus Tech Tips that has multiple side channels and millions of subscribers handled it. Essentially, they just hired on a new CEO to handle all of the Business Administration stuff while the original channel owner and his wife still own the channel and the company so he can focus on making videos and still have the final say over all of the important stuff. This happened recently so if this approach is going to fail or not hasn't been decided but it seems like the best way of handling the situation that I have seen from any youtuber. Please don't sell out again.  That's it. I really, really hope this works out.    P.s. If it does, can you get the original Amish games cast back plus Wes and Flitz. That would be great
My heart 💕🥹🥹🥹🥹🫠🫠🫠🫠
there should be a documentary movie about smosh ongod
Shock… I’m just in shock
This is a little healing to my inner child💓💓💓 Also Ian looks like a very good and caring dad and Anthony looks like the sweet, cool uncle lol
this story is extremely touching, to hear the growth stories of two of the greatest content creators i had the privilege of watching when i was a young 8-9 year old back in 2012-2013 mirror the ones of myself and my friends growing up and aging over the years. it's a grueling reality but it's so calming to hear those same human struggles being displayed although in a different context but still being at its core just human, and that's what smosh was and hopefully will be, two friends who enjoy making content getting behind a camera and just doing it, and inspiring a generation to do so. Even though self sustaining youtube content at this point is a fallacy without sponsorship or external support it feels like the dream was started with you guys and it goes on with you simultaneously in this current content landscape. best of luck, lots of love from all us long time fans
I actually only ever watched one Smosh video (The Real Death Note) but as an Anthony fan I'm looking forward to it!
In 2008/2009 my mom showed me smosh and encouraged me watching it. Smosh has always been a huge part of my life since then. I’m so happy you’re back Anthony
Anthony leaving was a canon event
crazy!
“If we burn it to the ground I’m happy to do that with you”  Mah heart ❤️🥹
Listen. I think the drive you guys have to do Smosh independently is enough for me to become a member and support. I totally get that YouTube demonetization would hammer down hard on you guys doing half the things you did before Defy, so if getting memberships is what it takes to make the next chapter of Smosh work, I'm down to contribute. So far, there are at least 2,000 members, which means at least $6,000 a month. I hope the final income is enough to get you all on the right track.
P.s I remember coming to live with you guys for a bit when we recorded Sex Ed and it was one of the best experiences of my life. You guys were so down to earth and we all really became friends. You both are amazing human beings and it brings me so much joy to see you guys back together. Love you both 🫶✨
This is more enthrilling than avengers endgame. The feels are bigger.
Perhaps this is the healing this timeline needed
Anyone else kind of get some red flag energy when Ian said they hadn’t told anyone at Smosh? Considering everything that happened at Defy, it seems like instant change of modus operandi would be a traumatizing subject for the people that worked through it. I know it’s Anthony, but from the way he’s talking about it, it scares me to think about creating a divide between Ian and Anthony and the rest of the cast. One of the reasons I love Smosh after Anthony left was it felt like there was more equality and everyone got to shine in their own way. Anthony talking about how it’s going to be just the two of them making the sketches really makes me sad if the rest of the cast isn’t included.
Started watching Smosh when I was in the First Grade. Now I’m going into Senior Year and it’s absolutely magical that our Boys are back as the rightful owners of Smosh.   Plz bring these back:  1. FOOD BATTLE 2. Lunchtime with Smosh 3. Pokémon Series
Anthony and Ian, I am literally complete. ❤
What is the future of this channel and your work on your own?
my childhood is back 🥲
Man it’s so disheartening to hear the full context about Anthony and his ex’s daily vlogs. I absolutely loved them as a kid but if I worked an 80-100 hour work week and my partner wanted me to be “ on” for a camera to try exotic fruits I would also consider pulling an Ian
Don't worry, any 10-year-olds that watching your videos were already damaged
34:56 Ha ha *"Balls up in my head"* 😂
Thank you, Diana
This makes up for any reunion that will never be!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I forgot about the milk fic  I wish I still did 😢
also i hope the “anthony’s the hot one” bullshit goes away bc ian is foine too. not that the attractiveness level of either of them really matters but like heyyyy ian😁
For real tho bois...PLEASE do another gaming video with CinnamonToastKen and PewDiePie!
I think that this talk was very needed, not only for the people who grew up watching Smosh but especially for Ian and Anthony.  It's nice to see them together again and the fact that the real Smosh is coming back is absolutely insane and I'm fully tuned in!!
Now we need Joji on cold ones
This video feels like two divorced people coming together and talk about how shit it all was.
OMFG!!!
SHUT UP! ......❤
So glad you guys decided to talk about this! We all missed you
Rhett & Link are certified GOATs for helping make this happen. Ian & Anthony are just GOATs in general.  So f*cking happy to see the "Smosh Saga" come full-circle <3
Love the Ksubis Anthony!
The amount of times i rewatched if apps were real for anthonys last vid
The smosh movie was fuckin great
A weird coincidence, the number of likes on this video equal the same amount of times Ian says 'like' 😂
DAMN!!!!!!
It makes me so happy to see you all together again after all these years, I teared up a few times during this video. I grew up watching smosh from the beginning, I saw all the ups and downs and Anthony leaving. Gosh idek how to describe the feeling but all seems right in the world in this moment.
I couldn't stop smiling trought this whole video even through tears.. im so so happy all of this is happening 🥹🩷
As someone who has been here for 15 years, I’m so excited to see what’s in store 🎉
I feel like I can die in peace now😅 thanks for this episode
It’s always been pretty clear that when Anthony left to find his own personal creative style him rejecting smosh left Ian feeling abandoned and rejected by his friend
FINALLY!!!
Avengers assemble!
I love this so much!!! Can't wait to see what these to now that they're proper friends again 😍😍😍
I watched the entire video at normal speed on my TV, it was like watching a movie. Amazing to see you 2 back together.
THE ASSASINS CREED OUTFIT AND LINK OUTFITS ARE LOST ARTIFACTS NOW??????????
Hello Anthony! If you ever manage to see this comment could you please spend a day with women with PCOS?? It's a syndrome that causes more male hormones in the female body along with other things as well causing woman to grow weight and even facial hair! A lot of women including myself have this and ever since I was a kid I've had many hardships finding others that also have this or knowing that others have this making us feel alone in a struggle with something we can't treat. Maybe a video of women with it could spread more awareness that there are others out there that feel our pain and know that there are others out there that also work through it.  From experience PCOS has caused bullying through my years of schooling because of facial hair and other places like legs, arms, stomach that grow hair and I was often bullied because of it. Some of my own family even went out of their way to say I'd never find love or get married because of something that is harder to control as a kid. I hope you find this and help share with the world that we aren't monsters! We're humans too!   Thank you!
I can't even express how happy this makes me. SMOSH was the first channel I started really watching on YouTube when I started using a PC. I'm 23 now but I learned English through watching old Smosh. Al these years later I still look forward to every tntl video because the sketches make me feel nostalgic and give me a good laugh. Suddenly I see Anthony's back. I literally shed a tear... Greetz from Belgium. You guys are amazing!!
Aw my heart❤❤❤😢
Im i the only one that misses the talking Guinea pig?😂😂😂
It's time close our books of our childhood and see Smosh as a new chatper in our adult life. Can't wait to see what's to come!
IM CRYING OML I MISSED THEM TOGETHER
now is a perfect time for you guys to rekindle smosh :) back when you guys were falling off, there was a lot of stress with how youtube was changing and how it wasn't enough to support older creators with teams compared to the newer generation of youtube; channels like gmm got extremely lucky to drift by and still be super big and successful now it's a lot easier to be a smaller youtuber and run your own channel without things like machinima or other producers controlling cannels on their downgrowth  now that anthony has his own channel that's successful and can take things like sponsorships, hopefully there's a lot more freedom in smosh now and it's not given to corporate shlop lol
I feel like the easiest place to see the deterioration was in lunchtime with smosh. Those used to be my favorite vids on the channel, id watch and rewatch them and loved seeing two friends goofing around unscripted. the forced friendship really started to leak through close to the end  it’s weird how a series that probably started as a break from writing, filming, and editing, a more relaxed and unscripted way to make content but also spend time together in a casual setting, most likely became a burden as well due to the friendship dwindling. they touched on the annoyance of daily blogs and tons of vloggers have mentioned how it corrodes the barrier between work and life but it must have been extra hard to pretend the friendship was the same as ever and just two guys having lunch w all that shit happening  (all this to say please bring back lunchtime with smosh!! kidding but also ya know…)
I was waiting for this for a long time
I am so happy rn
Gawd Ian is still creep and this seems like a desperate move to make him likable again lol. Im 35 and I remember smosh at the beginning. After Ian sold out he became a drone.  All in all I really hope this works and I hope they are genuinely happy. First things first I loved their friendship, that’s what got me in the beginning. Much love yall
Why was I expecting to find a comment from Shayne like "ONG That's my boss"
So stoked for this reunion. As a kid my uncle showed my yalls videos and i grew up watching them and sharing inside jokes about them withbmy friends.
the earth is healing 🫶
Made me so sad but happy to see them together again :’). Seriously grew up watching you two everyday.
I hope Brandon Rogers will appear in some videos just like Anthony appears in some of his videos. It would be so cool to see that!
@anthonypadilla why do i feel like every 5 seconds one of you is gonna say b*tch😭😭
Please try and get Ryan Higa on here
i just want to see a sketch with corridor's help on vfx
This has me in my feels like when Steve from Blue's clues came back 😂❤
Anthony: eye contact, not afraid to express emotions  Ian: looks away when saying something personal, holding emotions back  Ian👏open👏up👏 we love you
This episode is a Naruto and sasuke moment frfr
Oh wow, this really warms my heart.
Lets Go! Anthony is Back in Smosh!!!
PADILDO & HECOCK BABYYY
When’s mail time and lunchtime with smosh coming back? 😂
Does this mean Food Battle is coming back?
Revivió youtube señores🚬
MY CHILDHOOD
This is the Best Day ever
I have been waiting for years, but I hope this means food battle 2023?
I only have one negative thing to say. Ian is noticeably holding back. He's in work mode for like 50 minutes straight, and it makes it seem like Ian is so used to working for people, he doesnt see himself as independent anymore. And it severely pushes his profile of being a puppet to that company, since its almost like he doesn't feel like his own person anymore. Throughout the whole video he gets real like 3 times and even though he would joke about being too strict now, he doesn't actually smile about it.  Also Rhett and Link are the best omg
I'm so happy that Rhett and Link were who bought SMOSH so that this could happen. Glad to have you two back!
Smosh was a large part of my childhood. Looking back, the humor doesn’t fit as well for me anymore, but at the time, it was the best. Glad to see you are on good terms with each other, and congratulations for getting Smosh back!
I am tearing up right now. I watched SMOSH during my high school years; I am happy Anthony and Ian are still friends!  Congrats on the buy back!
Some of my greatest memories was to sit in my room on a rainy day and watch lunchtime with Smosh. Was soooo enjoyable and comforting to watch, so many amazing memories from that!
Super props to Ian for staying on the sinking ship and shovelling water out of it bit by bit, we wouldn't have had a chance of this resurgence without him! (And mom and dad Rhett and Link)
New Food Battle perhaps?
I was one of those people ian I loved the Smosh movie with all my heart!!
Yayyyy, one direction can come back together next, then my life will be complete, no nvm, Jenna marbles gotta come back too 😭
People are gonna start saying "I miss the old, new smosh" 😂
I have been watching smosh since I was 10. I am now 27! I am so happy this is happening
This honestly had me balwing by the end. Thank you soo much guys for coming back together this means the world to me
This is so amazing guys great news!!!
first vid back needs to be FOOD BATTLE 2023
I missed you guys
Dude yesssss. I’m so happy you guys finally got back together and own Smosh!
My younger self would cry if I told him that Anthony and Ian got together again and talked about everything.
My inner child is healing ❤
Is this a dream?! I’m so happy for them and SO EXCITED for new Smosh content with them together again!🥹
Food battle 2023????
i loved both of the movies you guys made ngl
Next Ian's mom?
I’m so fcking happy!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🥹🥹🤘🏻💯
I didn't really even watch Smosh when I was younger but the mention of the milk fic at the end almost made me drop my damn tablet pen. War flashbacks.
Can u do one with 8-BitRyan one day? Plz? 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Really hope they bring the old Smosh games crew back
Food battle 2023?
"Even if we burn it to the ground, I am glad to do it with you," The fan fic that writes itself. Just saying that made me full on tear up.
51:44 I’ve missed Anthony’s dolphin laugh and I love how Ian is able to make him laugh like that
I'm so happy for these two, this is extermely healthy and I can not wait for the future of Smosh!
I respected Anthony when he first broke away from Smosh, and I still, but for some reason I always felt like Smosh was missing a key piece of it without Anthony there.
"Even if it doesn't go well and we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you." that was so wholesome and heartwarming, what happened to Smosh was like a movie story and now we have the happiest most satisfying ending possible to that story.
Soooo I can finally start watching Smosh again after over a decade??
this was beautiful. I’m so happy for you two 🥹
I always wanted to have them back and now they are
the fucking L A D S
Modern gritty boxman please
i want to give them both hugs this is so precious
This was a cannon event
HOLY FRIGGIN SMOKES! THE BOYS ARE BACK!!
Day 3 of asking to interview Stanleymov. But smosh is back again thank god. YIPPEE
the milk fanfic....
YESSSSSSSSS!!!!
Do it for fun. Take hiatuses if yall need it. So incredibly cool to see all the pieces come back together.
It’s been incredible to watch the arc you’ve gone through even alone, Anthony, but the growth and maturity both of you have accomplished to able to come back to each other is truly inspirational. And then on top of that, to share that with the world shows so much courage and vulnerability. It’s really beautiful :) I’m so happy for you both. ❤️
Why don't they say that they love each other? I don't get it.
Congrats on acquiring Smosh. The prodigal son runs
Didn't realise Ian was still doing smosh this whole time. He's in tons of videos holy shit.
This lowkey feels like my parents getting back together <3 Smosh was what influenced me to start my original YT channel in high school. You can tell they were both hurt by the breakup in different ways. I'm so glad they can speak so openly now. So excited for them moving forward!
Am og fan of smosh
I was 11, now I'm 21. It's unbelievable that you're back!❤️
Smosh and youtubers at that time were literally my childhood. It's great seeing you guys so emotionally mature and opening up about your past
Dude, this alone is holding this timeline in place. I can’t go back in time anymore cause there’s a chance that reuniting wouldn’t happen, and I can’t risk that
17 1/2 years… that’s literally my age👀
I never watched og Smosh as a kid, so it's such a different experience for me to experience them while they are older
The Smosh Empire coming back, just like the Assyrians. Hopefully there won't be a civil war to round it off.
good things happening in the world rn
Me and my 10 year old self are ecstatic right now
Dude.....my heart. Im so excited. They are my avengers!
I hope for the best for you both! I watched you two growing up since I was 8, and now I'm 23, and still keep track of you both. The venture you two are entering was unexpected by many, but I think you two will have plenty of support.
you are both past your canon event and can live to your full potential
wow
Yes they are back I’m so happy to see smosh back together. You have made me and my friends laugh throughout our childhood and well into my teen years. Thank you for all the laughs you two!
I remember one episode, when one of them threw the car key away. Was very funny.
bro this takes me back...
🥹🥹🥹🥹
Congrats guys! I've been waiting for this to happen for a long time. I wish you guys the best. Keep going, keep growing and keep doing what you love.
It truly feels like the world is healing. I watched Smosh with my best friend when I was 15/16 years old. Now I’m 30 and I sent her the link to this video. It’s all full circle!
Food Battle 2023
glad you guys talked about how you werent intentionally appealing to kids, lots of other youtubers i watched when i was little made edgy content that was way worse than what you guys made but there were never any indication between stuff for "kids" and stuff for "adults" molester moon scared the shit out of me when i was little lmao idk why people would say smosh was for kids
I’m gonna cry
Food battle?
This is one of the first signs that the world is healing ✨️ ❤️ 💖
what a fucking time to be alive now, so fucking happy i didnt kill myself successfully over all these years. our boys are back!
Even in the time you guys felt such low inspiration and creative energy me and my sister would connect so much over your videos, we'd quote it all the time, and watch together and it meant the world to us. We're both so excited to see you guys thriving like this. Can't wait to see what direction you guys will take with it ❤
Bro Ian looks like seth green from scooby doo 2.
so happy for u both <3
Just wanted to say a warm-hearted TRANSFORMERS ROBOTS IN DISGUISE
I loved that movie when it first came out still do about to watch it after this lol thanks for the reminder
Anthony, you're not just the hot one anymore! You're the hot one AND the emotional one.   Jokes aside, seeing you two reunite is absolutely insane and my young "emo" teen self would maybe even smirk a bit. The fact that this situation is touching so many people around the world is wild and I can't even imagine how you two must feel about the reunion and finally getting Smosh back. Thanks for opening up and giving an insight into the whole thing, it's something special to see and listen to what happened behind the scenes.  Also.. In case you somehow end up reading this within the 10k comments, I'd love to see a Try Not to Laugh with Mykie. 🖤
I'm super stoked to see how this will develop going forward! Been watching Smosh since 2008, and will love to see this union prospers going forward. Great job guys!
I actually watched the whole thing! I'm so crazy happy that we get Smosh back!  From now on, we won't be able to leave comments like "I miss the old Smosh" or "Old videos are better - YouTube's Golden era". OMG... It's the end of an era! 😂❤
I learned a lot of life (and business) lessons from this video.  Probably the first time that I watched this kind of video for an hour and I don't even feel tired watching it.  Glad to see the classic Smosh is back. My childhood fun is coming back again.
LETS BURN IT TO THE GROUND
Oh my god, I did NOT know you made the Mortal Kombat lip sync video!
Food battle 2023?
The cool uncles of Youtube
It's really amazing to watch Anthony & Ian so vulnerably dive into the deterioration of Smosh and their friendship. Seeing them back together after all these years, but with more perspective & maturity is such a gift for those of us who grew up on Smosh in the old days.  Proud of both of you & very excited for what the future will hold!
the ultimate reunion
THE WORLD IS HEALING
so much of the conflict to is that they were so young when smosh started. of course they were overwhelmed!!!!!
Ian seeing smosh more as a business and Anthony seeing it as a creative thing Logical and emotional sides of smosh together intertwined with friendship
this is the video I've been waiting my whole adult life for <3
I really connect with Ian here because my emotions have been so abnormally stunted in the last few years due to crunch, grad school is like a social disease.   It's genuinely exhausting to pretend to have stronger emotions than I actually do, and after a never-ending 60 hour work week marathon I simply don't have the energy to expend on amplifying emotions for show anymore.
I"VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO FOREVER
So Rhett and link are basically amazing people
"Ryan was kneeling in the bathtub"
SMOSH IS BACK BAYYYYBEEEEEEE
I love how after Anthony left even though their relationship wasnt the best, ian was still keeping tabs on what Anthony was doing.
you guys definitely had peak early millennial/zillenial humor
I'm part of the new generation, didn't grow up with Smosh but happy to be along for the ride now!
So nice to hear a little bit about the behind-the-scenes of what happened when he left. For so long fans just could not believe that they could  not have any crossover on their channels if they were in fact still good friends as they said
This video feels like the biggest warmest hug ever! Almost like reassurance that this is all real
This video is super well done and love that Anthony and Ian can have a great chat about what they were feeling at the time, during it, and the aftermath of it. It seemed super healthy and very nice to see these two have such good chemistry to this day
Last time I had watched a Smosh video of was going into high school and now I’m so excited to watch it again so many years later that my daughter turns 2 next month… I just don’t know what to say aside from best of luck and I can’t wait to see more of you guys having fun again!
Now we need I spent the day with Shayne topp
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Most people go on villain arks. Anthony padilla went on a whole hero's journey.
best episode yet, such an open and vulnerable conversation. As a person who grew up with Smosh I feel like I needed this episode
I was shocked seeing this video. Some part of me believes that there is still hope in the world and that we are still on the right timeline
Iam glad to see you guys together. I wish you guys the best!
Smosh the movie sequel?
Ayo I saw this video and dropped everything I was doing.
"Did you learn to feel emotions after that?"  "I don't know, probably."   Why do I relate to this so much?
9:08 My parents actually banned me and my brother from watching smosh after my 6 year old brother started singing “I shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow” around the house. They knew the “SHUT UP” intro was smosh, to the point they’d stop us and get mad if they heard it. I think that’s wild to me
I dont usually consider smosh as a part of my childhood growing up because it was mostly my young cousins showing me and my brother what they thought was funny and me sitting there borded. But i knew they were not supposed to be watching you guys and i still didn't rat em out because their smiles as they preformed reenactments of your comedy and smiling ear to ear while i filmed them will forever be solidified in my memories 😆
Soooo here's my genuine prediction based on years of working with people, helping them out with their personal issues and mental health, and being generally pretty emotionally intelligent:  I still think Ian has a lot of growing to do in the emotional-intelligence category and his ability to express what he's really feeling (it still feels like he's holding back, like he's got a lot of walls up or something), and unless he does that growing, I fear things might build up negatively again where Anthony is the emotionally intelligent one now and Ian is still sort of cornered off.  BUT, that said, Ian is in therapy, so hopefully he'll get better OR hopefully he's just holding back on camera but is actually quite open and emotional privately.
I’ll be honest here, pretty much everyone on the outside looking in could see selling smosh was a terrible idea. I feel like if you talked to anyone they would have told you the same. I applaud Anthony for leaving and trying something new. For realizing that smosh wasn’t working and moving on.
You should make a film. But not about your channel, but about you. You guys are amazing and went through a lot. You are the best, love you both.
I literally forgot that they were both a part of smosh for a sec 💀💀😅 finally he’s doing ian wait hold on a darn sec that’s his best friend😂😂
you guys together reminds me of my childhood🥲 such a wholesome moment it’s great to see you guys return, feels like the right place and right time
Growing up i didn't watch smosh but i have a feeling some people are crying rn...
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGGGGG
I think lots of talking came before this video.
now we need a new smosh cast reacts to milk fanfiction episode 😂
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do it with you." You can feel years, months, days of regret in this statement cuz Ian just says that he value his friendship with Anthony more than the channel now. Really the most perfect ending speech you can get from him.
Now that you own the channel delete that other crap on the channel . And let it be just you two
This makes me so happy to see you two together again you guys have been friends since you guys were in sixth grade!!! That’s fucking insane
Over the years Ian has made a few videos showing everyone currently at Smosh at the time and I think you should do another   Show off that you're both back together and show us all the current cast and crew members to set the table for the future Smosh videos to come  And to celebrate Smosh and all its amazing people
51:43 that laugh xD
bro now since we've gotten an Ian Hecox interview now need an Anthony Padilla interview
🌚🌚🌚
I don’t do commenting very often, but this is one of the most meaningful things I’ve seen in a long time Smosh was the first YouTube channel I ever enjoyed related with, and I have been waiting for the day. You have it be reborn I’m even more happy that you guys went through growth and I are coming back with such an amazing presents. I am more than excited.
yo Anthony i ain’t never spent no money on youtube… but this special
This is the way.
Not me looking up goatse 💀 that was a fun surprise
Thanks!
Their story is a reminder that it's never a bad thing to have people leave your life. Sometimes it's for the best and if you're meant to find each other again someday you will
It's weird to see Ian and Anthony are adults now it's weird to see but great to see what sketches they give birth to.
So what’s this “Milk Fan Fic” I’m hearing so much about…?
I’ve been waiting for this one 😭
Please bring back "Lunchtime w/ Smosh" 🙂
I know these were cooler in the early 2010s but I miss video game songs like legend of Zelda, if you guys find a way to adapt that concept in 2023 it would really cool.
I love you Rhett and Link. Thank you for making our dream a reality❤
This was like therapy for all the kids that grew up in early YouTube
smosh was my life
we bought smosh is #1 on trending and this #2. it not enough
HIS NAME IS MAX! HE DOESNT WEAR A HELMET!
We can say it again. "ANTHONY FROM SMOSH"
After 6 years it's back! the ultimate duo!
Grew up on these two up til 2012 ish. Is ian normally this serious and much more rigid than anthony?
these two are some of the real OGs of youtube, they legit started out when i was a kid
I need the "shut up" intro again
The reason these guys are so important to the internet is because they were all of our friends. They weren't just each other's friends, we grew up with them and they were our friends too. Them being back is like all of us are getting our old friends back.
Happy to see you two get Smosh back and glad to have worked with you guys in the Sac days.
Love is love
I’ve been waiting for years for Ian from Smosh and Anthony Padilla from AnthonyPadilla to do a collab, finally got to meet in person wow
Okay since Smosh is back, can we please get at least one episode of Lunchtime with Smosh again or a opening mail with Smosh again because that was always some of the best videos ever made by you two, it definitely made me feel as if I was with you boys and felt like it was just a hangout and that is something everyone needs sometimes
Defy going under was a Canon event
I had no problem with smosh the movie. It was great for my child self.
They're back and i can't wait for the old content type of videos to come be back with much better production and higher quality, most of our childhoods was just watching these two making videos in a room and now we're all adults and the nostalgia is as real as ever. Really happy for these two and it's great to see Smosh making a big comeback.
The return of Boxman???
Beyond the lessons learned regarding creative partnerships, the lesson of learning to let go of expectations about what your childhood friendships used to be and accept the growth and change that is inevitable with your now adult friendships is so important.
This is GREAT Anthony, just don't burn out. Get a patrion so you guys don't have to adhere to YouTube's rules
My whole middle school era was smosh. Between them and nigahiga, they ran my childhood during the start of the youtube era. When I tell you I bursted with joy when Anthony said they own smosh again, I did. I’m so happy to hear this news, and I hope they put smosh in their own directive again. I’m excited to see where they go with it! I stand by these two 100%
Ok
bro it's not that deep bro
I will cry stop 😢 1:12:12
smosh breaking up and harambe dying irreversibly wrecked the timeline. so now we can atleast heal, somewhat.
You two were my favorite youtubers going through middle school. It just felt nice to know that there were adults being as awkward, weird and goofy as I was.  No offense of course. Loved watching you guys act like fools opening fan mail on Ian's second channel and cant wait for you two to climb back up. ALL HAIL THE EX-AFI LEAD AND HIS NO-LONGER CEREAL BOWL HAIRED FRIEND!
ngl, this video made me think that a podcast with these two would be pretty fire, just sayin...
SMOSH IS A TOP TEN OG, OF THE FIRST YOUTUBE CHANNELS!    Who else would be in the top ten, of the OG first YouTubers?
This is AMAZING. ❤️
The Sex-Ed music video is still a YT classic
This feels like Naruto getting Minatos half of Kuramas chakra
1:11:55 idk, I found what Ian said, about burning it to the ground, pretty hilarious considering I had thought their channel died when the new Smosh crew attracted a new set of fanbase because I know for a fact not many og fans stayed, the humor seemed forced and I remember seeing so many comments about which member they found the most annoying or hated the most, it was such a weird time (I'd say it was in Smosh Games I think about 2-3 years ago).
I want more of this out of character content with both of them
Did you HAVE to bring up the milk fic????? I was just teleported back in time
I would love a mini I spent the day with series where Anthony interviews some of the smosh cast
Guys we need the shut up button back.
Omg I remember seeing smosh like the beg of YouTube 😍😍
Can’t wait for the alpha/omega fics the new generation will bring 😂
What’s happening to the other cast
Does this mean Ian’s mom will be making a return?
This is so healing for my middle school self
Why would you bring up the milk fanfic ??? Help
I watched smosh probably between the ages 10-13 religiously. When it was bought by defy I slowly fell away from it. I can now say as a 20 y/o listening at my 9-5 I have almost cried several times. I've gotten shivers through this whole episode, and I will be so dedicated to seeing everything you guys accomplish now with full leverage. I am one of your most overjoyed NPCs
Listen, we KNOW that Damien took the assassins creed & link outfits, it’s okay
"I spent the day with..." is a phenomenal show! I'm proud Anthony found his voice and I'm excited to see him back. Hope he knows he's loved! Both of these knuckleheads are! Congratulations fella!
OMFGG YESSSS I LOVED SMOSH SO MUCH IM C4YING
This was therapy. Thanks guys.
GIVE ME NEW SMOSH MERCH
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN (boys are back in town)
Yo it's that one guy 👁️ jokes aside this is cool, nice lil reunion
I've said this before, fuck getting to snl, I wanna be on smosh baby
This makes me so happy!!
i want a count on how many times Ian said "like"
What song was Anthony referencing? Also I'm so happy you guys are back ❤️
I opened the video thinking it would be the normal anthony padilla video until 5 mins later i realized they were together as smosh becuase i had just forgot
You guys have great chemistry, you should start a sketch comedy channel together.
Watching this was like seeing my split up parents talking to each other again
The camera moving closer when Anthony said he was gonna cry is taking me out 😭
This is more important than Jesus Chris my lord.
We haven’t showed emotions so this is great “i still won’t” ok
Thank you. I needed this. FRFR
41:45 42:05  this was so sweet 🥹
You should do a day with Rhett and link !
Who is this guy
what a moment!
THE WORLD IS HEALING!!!
Mom and dad are back together, I’m healed 🩷 love u guys
They should make a channel together
Not the fanfics💀
Smosh will be NOTHIN without Rhett and Link. Just you watch…..
23 going on 24, found you guys from my older brother like figure when I was maybe 7 or 8. I go back to those older era of videos annually, it's extremely surreal to see you two even talking about the business, but also having that back and forth you initially grabbed me and formed my older brother and I's humor and bond. Wishing the best for YOUR channel.
1:10:36 “the gap hug”
To see you guys come back together reminds me of the story of comedy duo Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, but much healthier haha. You may relate to some of their story. After Dean passed, Jerry wrote a book called Dean & Me, A Love Story.
I hope they have a talk with youtube CEO to have the Smosh main channel removed from the blacklist!
Anthony and Ian's story reminds me of Forest Gump Lol.  But serious I'm so happy that those two rekindled the friendship they had all those years ago.
Well, that was GREAT 😊 !!!👍
Honestly I’m happy they are friends again.
WILL WE HAVE FOOD BATTLE 2023?!?!
Fuck man 17 1/2 years now that’s a legacy
This is a canon event
Ian sharing the frustration of Anthony refusing to be in collabs (though understandable) is something a lot of the fans felt.
It's something like this that inspires confidence in the next chapter for Smosh.
I refuse to watch unless there's an entire series about Anthony returning to the office and getting bullied by Shayne and/or Damien
My heart, I loved watching your videos way back in the day. Smosh was my childhood and so many others
WOAAAH I HAD NO IDEA THEY EVEN KNEW EACHOTHER 🤯🤯
I loved that they took turns saying mhmm when they were really digging deep my heart is so happy your together and happy
If you would have any idea what this means to me 😢, I was quite young when I started watching you, no friends and suicidal at a young age. When I found you guys, I felt like I found someone who understands my humor and in general the content. I felt so attached to you guys and it helped me get out of the suicidal time. Also because of you guys is the way I found and bonded with my best friend of 10+ years now!!! The fact that you got together brings so much joy and nostalgia 🎉🎉 you have no idea the amazing impact you have on people all across the globe!!! Love from israel, keep doing you guys 😁❤️ (and to the rest of the smosh community, keep em fanfics going eh? 😂😂)
i'm actually crying i love this new development
somethings happening......
whats happening....
I didn't discover Smosh until way after Anthony had left, whenever the Try Guys were on TNTL for the first time and I had never watched any of Anthony's stuff but something about them together made me feel the need to immediately join their membership. I hope this works out for them.
AHHHH
This may or may not be a dumb question, but I’m gonna ask it anyways. Do they own Smosh as a brand, all the channels or just the main channel itself?
You should`ve invited Ray from YourFavoriteMartian as well to this discussion, at least at the end, would`ve been interested seeing you two talk with him the moment you overtook him and all that stuff.
someone link me the milk fanfic pls, for research purposes
Food battle 2023
It was truly one of the worst deals in the history of deals
Anthony leaving Smosh, I can't interfere it's a Canon event.
AHHHHH
I personally loved the Smosh movie❤️
Please do this with Rhett and Link, I'd love to 1.) Hear their side and 2.) Just an interview In general
Yes I remember smosh 2015
We gotta see foodwars 2025
Im so happy, and seeing you being so positive and excited is amazing and I can't wait 🥰
I'm still confused as to how this is going to work. Did they ONLY buy the main-channel? will the other cast-members be in some of the sketches? will Ian still be on pit/games? Tbh. this didn't clear up anything.
Thank you guys!
”if we burn it to the ground I’m happy to do that with you” - Ian Hecox ❤️🥲
Rhett and Link are such goats for not only saving Smosh after the Defy disaster but selling Smosh back to Anthony and Ian.
When I say I have been waiting for this video since 2018, the world seems all quite right again now. My dads are back!
i started watching smosh in 2009 when i was 6 years old. im now 20 and have changed a lot; same for you guys so the fact that i can watch smosh as an adult with how i am now and the humour i have now and how you guys are now its exciting to see what the future will bring :)
this is a midlife crisis i can financially support with enthusiam
You missed the opportunity to say "friendship always wins" when you high fived 🥹
I love this video, wholesome and goofy. I definitely yearned for Ian and Anthony again. So excited for the upcoming videos.
This is all so surreal. I"m insanely proud of you both and I'm happy you both shared your journey with us. My inner child is so happy.
I feel like Ian and Anthony being back together with EVERYONE at smosh is going to make this channel something nobody has ever seen
The movie wasn't great, but I didn't enjoy it.
First bite!
i can’t believe i had to be reminded of the milk fic in the year of our lord 2023……
After seeing Wassabi productions come back together could we have an early YouTube renaissance? Cause Im really excited for sketches
I cant believe yall bought smosh again: revolutionary shit right here!!
I swear you can see in the smosh videos when Ian and Anthony had that writing session. Ian totally got his spark back lately!
It's crazy that this is #2 trending on YouTube and with the Smosh channel it's #1 trending on YouTube, welcome back!
Cyberspace celebrities…. LOL!
1:11:35 "Even if it doesn't go well and we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you."
I don't think it was Anthony being a diva. It makes sense to mourn smosh when it went corporate without a unique style
I actually did start watching around 9-10😹 I’m 21 now
IANS FIT IS SO GOOD
Had to login just for this HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT!!!
They should bring back Pokémon trainer videos . Lol
the comedy never left, the business juat got in the way  that and didnt they not go to college and have like a 'normal' separation phase that a lot of other friends have to do. i feel like that moment of them being separated is like that for them, and im so proud of them for graduating and making it both on their own, and now together again. so happy for them
crying my eyes out watching this i lov yall
I would have loved to see the other cast and crew of smosh's reaction to the news  I am so happy for them that they finally have what they made back, I dont care what comes of it, its such an amazing thing to see and be apart of again.  I was feeling down yesterday due to a an aniversary of a bad thing that happend last year but this really put me back up.
The smosh baby cartoon was the best
This is healing my inner child
movie was goated IDK what their saying
♥♥♥♥
smosh-cast
I love how non-judgemental this video was, very calm talk hashing out the past. Very healthy ❤.
Can't wait for the return of Mail time with Smosh
Smosh the movie was fire no one can disagree with me
You know this is probably stupid, but when Smosh kind of split, and ultimately when the company that owned it went to shit I began making bad choices. Nothing to do with smosh the timing just lined up. Years later I finally quit doing the dumb shit I was doing, I moved out and I started working on myself. Now life’s beginning again it feels like, and these two fucks are back! Not only are they back they own their creation again   It’s beautiful to me
i love this.
So Smosh games and Smosh Pit are also under You and Ian or that remains under Mythical?
Fucking crazy, I always assumed you guys were always close still after all this time, I’m happy this happened, and I hope we can sometimes even just once see a lunchtime with Smosh lol
Please bring back yearly food battles 🍩 😂
“if we burn it to the ground, i am happy to do that with you” HOLY SHIT THATS SO GOOD IM USING THAT IN MY FANFICTION (don’t worry it’s completely unrelated to smosh)
Are y’all buying the house back?
What happened to Ian's bowl cut? :(
I grew up watching you two. You guys have influenced many people. Your Zelda rap is my favorite. I miss old Youtube. Watching you guys goof off, good times. ❤
I like how all of our childhood is coming back
This isn't like when you and your soulmate break up from 22 to 35 before you get back together and have rocking marriage
i can’t believe they brought up the milk fic 😭
Wow, can’t believe all the shit theyve been through
I’ve loved you guys ever since the Pokémon song, and… Teleporting Fat Guy! 😂❤  Also, this is kind of inspiring me to reach out again to my childhood BFF. We’re in touch but don’t talk as much anymore.
My childhood is officially back
Now i wanna get Ian and Anthony on Ear Buiscuits and just let everyone gush about how awesome everything this is!!!
This isn’t a interview it’s a Reunion
they are getting back together!!
Am I high or is that interiew not kinda awkward? Idk Ian just seems kinda manipulative and selfish, right?
I knew Anthony was gonna age like fine wine
Ian's alignment was too lawful for Anthony, and that's probably what created the split
1.8 million views in 18 hours. Holy algorithm batman.
These 2 people work so well together! If only they had a channel together… to bad that doesn’t exist, oh well
This is insane, Smosh was my childhood. I stopped watching around the time I suspect Anthony started to lose his creative force from the content as he said, because it was a few years before this channel. I obviously jumped ship here when this channel started up, but I am definitely up for buying the membership and supporting the new chapter of Smosh, exciting!
Holly fuckinggg shiitttttttt
I was at a Blink 182 concert a few days ago and asked if the crowd was "smoshing."
i am so glad you guys are together again. i would suggest dont focus on only comedy all the time this time around.
I have some lost friendships to mend....
Omg.... the milk fic. This was something I forgot about, now it's back. Thanks for that
collab with ghetto smosh
Every YouTube boy duo had a milk fic, it’s only right
YOU CAN BRING BACK MEAL-TIME WITH SMOSH?!?!?!
Thank you both for this video. Having grown up on Smosh, it was always a heavy focus on the content side, with little regard to the logistics or the thoughts of those running it. When you think of Smosh, you don't really think about raged out office parties fueled by dying hopes and dreams. You think of Food Battle and If Video Games Were Real. Hearing these stories, the openness about the real side of things, it makes it feel more human. It helps you really appreciate this thing for what it is, and the long emotional journey it was getting to this point. Can't wait to see what the future brings, and congratulations on once again owning Smosh.
landfill of friendship
Glad to see ya'll back together once again!
Good warssssss!!!!!!!!!!
Very interesting the resentment Ian felt when Anthony left. I feel like I went through a similar thing when my brother went to live with our dad. It's easy in the moment to not believe them, or to just brush it off, but after it happens it's like you start to think, toxically, "they abandoned me. I thought we were in this together, but I guess they weren't strong enough to go through the hardship I now have to endure on my own." It can be really negative. You just have to realize they did it because they saw a way out for themselves. It wasn't selfish, and you shouldn't hold it against them. You should be happy that they are able to find a new way to get over that struggle.
I’m happy Anthony and Ian own Smosh again but more importantly that their relationship has been repaired! Wonderful to see and can’t wait to see where things go from here with Smosh!
41:44 this was the best part it made me so happy
The hug was literally Smosh ✨
Live action “Milk” fanfic when?
It'll be fascinating to see where they'll be in a year
Huge wave of nostalgia
Theyve been friends since middle school. Thats respect right there
And people thought spider verse was a crazy crossover
“Even if we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do it with you” 😢 I teared up a little bit about that
You can see how happy is Anthony talking about his friendship with Ian :'3
Food Battle 2023 😅😅😅😅
FINALLY
Frick, ya'll make me so proud
The moment that blooper came I cried
I’m crying
This kinda made me tear up talking about the ups and down of their friendship and coming back together again to have their company back. Congrats guys 🎉
Shut UP
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you"  Ian Hecox to Anthony Padilla  Yes, June 20th 2023 will go down in history with no question.
I wasn’t a fan of you guys growing up, but it feels so relatable to see 2 friends reconnect and realize you are still best friends. It warms my heart. I’m so happy for you two.
18 or so years ago I sent the old Smosh fanmail/ artwork of their guinny pig and was shown on the channel.. that was such a highlight for me! <33
Shit…. Looks like  I’ll be getting a YouTube red membership for them
The Boys... ARE BACK!!!! *Cue epic Music*
I grew up watching Smosh - and I think we needed this healing as much as you guys did. Whatever happens, I hope your friendship is rekindled and you both find joy in what is coming next. I can sense some guard still up, but I know with time and learning who you are now as a people will help grow a new friendship rather than a business relationship. Good luck to you both and I can't wait to see what's in store.  Mad respect to Rhett and Link who fully supported them and is prioritizing their relationship before business.
goddddd. i grew up watching og smosh, i love the current smosh crew and have been watching them for a while, been watching anthony's solo vids the whole time. they seemed to have grown apart so much i never wouldve expected to see them together again. seeing ian here, he somehow feels so different from seeing him on smosh lately. its so cool to see them get so real.
Smosh had a huge impact on me as a kid. It makes me so happy that they're back
These slow mo guys seem awesome
I don’t cry much at stuff, but this honestly made me tear up a couple times, when Anthony cried, when Ian got really in depth about how much he was struggling tryna run the company and he was compartmentalizing with out his best friend there, big oof
what a trippy watch. this honestly felt like a "Youtube is healing" type moment
I can’t wait to watch smosh again with my partner and friends to reminisce the memory together
Christmas came early, I'm glad to see these two legends together again
Often times OG YouTuber groups fall off and for whatever reason can’t get completely back together. I’m really happy these guys at the very least have validation in having Smosh back to themselves. Happy for Ian, happy for Anthony. Two genuine dudes, wish them all the best.
That's why you HAVE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. I'm glad you guys were able to grow from this situation and actually reclaim some of your sanity by realizing you really have to put your foot down when it matters. I'm lucky to have experienced both sides of that kind of "they are destroying us" and the "we got a good thing going here" problem when I was a lot younger. A lot of people will go their entire lives without truly confronting it. That's why therapy can be crucial! Sometimes you just need someone to tell you from an objective outsider view.
Now I finally have something to watch whenever I eat ❤
Defy almost ruined this friendship, and that should never be forgotten.
Congratulations you two 🎉❤!!
This was so interesting to watch... I really can't wait for the new sketches!
Sometimes you just need some time and space. What works will mend itself when the moment is right.
This is the best news. Together and apart, you’ve both had such an impact on my formative years and early adulthood, and I’m so excited to see what you can do together again. This is huge! Congrats you guys, I’m rooting for you. And thanks for sharing your magic and creativity with the world!!
my heart :(((
I have never paid for any membership before but for smosh? TAKE IT TAKE ALL MY MONEY
Now. Will Anthony and ian go back to there old hair cuts. that would be pretty cool!
I’m gonna cry I’ll support smosh no matter what! I have been waiting for this for so long 😢 I nearly cried the moment they announce they bought smosh again I am so excited to fully support this thank you for being on camera together again! I’m so proud of y’all ❤
I hope we get to see some of Mykies talent in the new Smosh content. Would be really cool
SMOSH IS BACK!!! THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT! :))) SO HAPPY!
......... SHUT UP !
i love that ian read the fanfics
Is Anthony gonna get a funeral? Cause then Ian can roast the f out of him (in the best way possible)
I was never into real person fanfic so I've not heard of this milk one. If you're saying goatzi and blue waffle are not as bad, though, I might need to check it out due to the sick sense of curiosity that raises in me  Edit: nope, can't do it. Reading rpf still skeeves me out
wait so whats going to happen to this channel?
Food wars?
Seeing them together again is so amazing. They were pretty much the first youtube channel I subscribed to waaaay back in the day. And seeing them be vulnerable and honest with each other here was great.
feels like only a couple years ago when i was rewatching food battle 2009-2011 waiting for the next one to drop
I discovered youtube by googleling pokemon and scolling till i found the pokemon lipsync video.
Yeah this is perfect at first I had the feeling this is cool for nostalgia and stuff like that but will die fast but the way you guys seem to vision it now is literally perfect to improve on it but not use it only for nostalgia but to make it entirely something new but while also hitting factors of the past do whatever you need to do for golden humor count me in!
They need to do one last food battle I hope it happens
It's so wild to see how full circle things have come, and to see you guys just having a conversation together again. I'm so glad to hear you guys are in better places now than you were back when everything went down. Can't wait to see what you all do going forward!!
This episode's title is spending a day with smosh
So happy smosh is back always liked you two together
This video kinda made me teary  eyed!! I’m so excited 😆!!!
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY!! YALL WERE MY CHILDHOOD ❤❤
I grew up watching Smosh, and as I face the challenges of adulthood I always look back to your old videos to make me laugh. I'm very excited to see what your sketches entail, and to see your friendship gradually heal as you guys get to return to your roots in a sense and do what you love again. You two are an inspiration to many, and wish you the very best as not only business partners, but most importantly, as old friends.
It's not a breakup, it's a breakthrough to the next best thing ❤
Didn’t Fred make a mobile game and 3 movies.
I remember getting the movie from Walmart like the day it came out and got the mobile game too and played it for quite a while was definitely a smosh kid and can’t wait to see what y’all do with it now 💚💙
Anthony and Ian on the same channel what is this a crossover episode!?
“Even if we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to have done it with you.” 🥺😭
The timeline is healing.
27:22 anthony listents to draingang????????????
I feel like i just watched a therapy session with my divorced parents, and it was beautiful
I remember smosh from back in the day, and had completely forgotten about it until this episode popped up.. TRUE OG's of YouTube 👌
Did Lasercorn ever get his money back?
I think Smosh's pokemon video was the first video I ever saw on youtube. If it wasn't the first I know it was the the very first to make me want to keep coming back to the platform. I'm 28 how and don't watch too much youtube now a days and haven't kept up with individuals careers but seeing these two together just sparks so much nostalgia for me. I'm glad yall get to own Smosh officially!
it kinda seems like they hate each other?
I remember when i watched a smosh video for the first time, it was one of the Spanish translated videos, I was at a friend’s house. It was quite literally the reason i learned English
my divorced dads are back together 🥹
the childhood friends are back :,)
This is EXACTLY the kind of sit down I needed, like I knew all of this was going on behind closed doors but to hear it from them is really cathartic. The honesty and openness is incredible comforting and my nostalgic heart is just so happy to see two talented people come back together to have FUN. ❤️
I fucking LOVE the fact that even if Smosh totally tanks, these two want to ride the train all the way off the rails - together.  True brotherhood.
broooooooo, im soooooooooo happy to hear that you two legendary friends have smosh again and its time for smosh to be great
Yeah, as a Mythical Beast myself, I truly believe Mythical Entertainment really was the saving grace in this story.  Glad to see these 2 back together again :)
gooch queen
The Long awaited reunion…
Honestly this conversation heals my soul. So happy to see this come to life! Congratulations lads 🎉
Food battle 2023 coming lol
“if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you” “let’s burn this to the ground” I am in tears😭
I still have both magazines
This was not on my 2023 bingo card but I am HERE FOR IT
This is the best day of my life
Now heres the big question, will food battle come back?
This genuinely feels like the earth is healing a little bit
i didn't need to know they rewrote the milk fic for smosh 😟
I’m sorry, I love all the reconnecting and forgiving that is happening, but it irks me how Ian is talking about Anthony being cringe after leaving etc. he talks like he is above him or have been doing better, when Anthony genuinely have been steadily finding his way and innovated himself. Anthony’s struggle in the beginning was never as cringe as smosh has become 🤷‍♀️
This was such a great and mature conversation. I was like 8 when I started watching you and am now 25. Growth and friendship is so important. I'm so elated that you're back together as friends. the new videos are just a perk!
The internet is healing
this is like when dean martin and jerry lewis got reunited on TV in the 60s but for millenials
In the 2000s as a kid I would sit with my laptop on the floor and probably burnt holes in the carpet watching Smosh videos on the website 😭😭 summer I probably spend most of my days watching Smosh mainly but youtube !!
They should remake THEIR FIRST EPISODE!!! Just for nostalgic purposes.
It's wild that this is happening, I shed a tear. I've been watching since I was six years old!
Bowl and emo haircuts must come back
YouTube History
42:57 this part sounds to me like they are soulmates and that makes me heart so happy
I'm so happy you guys reconnected and that you're back as Smosh again! My one worry is that sketch comedy on yt isnt in the same place as it was in the beginning, or even a few years ago, I hope your new content doesnt get lost in the algorithm and you can make a big success out of it, and you both seem so happy and have a great relationship now which is way more important anyways! Much love to you guys
I miss 0.3 seconds ago when I didn't remember the milk fanfic
I am so fucking happy that you guys got to sit down and have a real talk again. You 2 were my childhood and this was such a good site in such a hard past few years for everyone. I think i speak for everyone when i say we are very happy to see you two able to be friends again ❤
NOT THE MILK FIC 😶😶😶 WHY DID YOU HAVE TO MENTION THE MILK FIC  💀 you know I'm double scarred, because that fic was originally a Panic at the Disco fanfic, and it was VERY infamous so of course I read it, and then I remember hearing "milk fic" in the context of Smosh fics years later and getting PTSD, just to find out it's THE SAME FIC just with the names swapped out 🙃
exciteddddd
My favorite thing about this is that Ian has repeatedly said that Smosh was born out of the two of them just wanting to make each other laugh, and it coming full circle with him being sure that they should buy the company together when they made each other laugh again.
How did I know this would happen?
It's nice to finally get the proper full story behind everything that happened. Because for the record, these are your privates lives, we don't NEED to know, but the fact that you're trusting us to let us hear the full story means a lot.
Food Battle 23 when
Thank you for being so vulnerable and honest with us. We missed you both. I miss mail time the most 🥺🥺🥺
9 year old me is shitting on himself
THE GOOD ENDING
Hi guys
I’m just realizing Ian kinda looks like destiny
31:13 I bet whoever has that assassins creed and link outfits with proper proof could sell those for thousands
i feel like they’re rhett & link if R&L didn’t grow up prioritizing communication/constantly reflecting on their relationship so I wonder if, apart from just being genuine fans/friends of smosh, they feel similarly and that’s part of why they were like ‘we can figure out the business stuff later but this is big and let’s talk abt how great this is’ :’)
WHAT ARE IANS SHOES 💳💳💳💳
So happy for these guys
22:52 Ian shares his side of stories; professionally, yet; I feel the emotion tho 🥲
Hope to see the return of boxman!
I'm personally suing both of you if you don't create another food battle
Top 5 greatest moments of all time?
ian was the positive one between the two of them. you heard it here first, folks
Can’t believe Smosh happened because of a school project 😂
This genuinely makes me so happy. This episode, smosh coming back, everything. I was seven when I started watching you guys and I’ll be 20 this year. I don’t know how to put this but it’s something very important and I can’t wait, much love❤️
that Refused song 💔
What Ian meant to say "woo hoo 4 dollars and 2 cents now"
I started wastching smosh when I was 14 now I’m 23
All I can say is take your time, I want both of your own individual personalities to shine in the way it has been.
This is a podcast duo I would actually reliably listen to
Can we get Smosh on World Peace 2
This really felt like a nice smosh therapy session, I’m so happy you were both able to get back to this place and I can’t wait to see what’s to come next 😊❤
SMOSH x MDE ?
Anthony leaving was a canon event 💀
YO WHAT?!?! MY CHILDHOOD. holy crap. you own smosh again??? I didnt even pass the first 5 minutes yet.
im dying rn
I am so happy. I’m 21, I grew up with Smosh, and I’m so happy to see them together again.
Bring back Peter 😌
will anthony continue to do his interview series as well??
damn it happened im funboying so hard rn, nostalgic af
If you love something, set it free. If it’s meant to be yours it will come back to you.
I cannot wait for the next "milky milkshake" video, that still cracks me up after all these years, nice to see you together again! Sending love to you guys!
ITS HAPPENING
Smosh employees when Ian says “if we burn it to the ground, oh well” 👀👀👀
For the past idk how many years, I still sometimes for no reason get the urge to say 'that damn neighbor is gonna have a hard time getting in here once I put these tacs on the tooop'.
I AM SCREAMING this is one of the best thing’s that happened this year
I have the movie on dvd
I know this is fast but we NEED food wars roboot
This actually made me cry many times, I'm so happy
NOOOOO NOT MILK FICCC SHKF  RH IFFHJK
This really warms my heart, felt so nostalgic and emotional, I'm glad you're back❤️😭
You two really create pure magic 🖤
I'm just really happy for you guys, as people. I bet that's what Rhett and Link were thinking too, when you told them. Having had a very intense close friendship through my teen and young adult years that fell apart in my late 20s, it gives me a little bit of hope, too, that maybe we, or at least other people like us, could grow back together again.
Now we all can die in peace knowing smosh are whole again
This still feels like a fever dream😭
It's interesting how they said how sketch comedy is almost impossible nowadays. I wonder if its because Smosh has internally changed its structure, gets less money, or people demand more money for internet projects nowadays. Still, its weird considering everything seems so much more monetized now with memberships, patreon, sponsorships etc. That was barely a thing in 2012-2013.
all i need to see is a collab with ghetto smosh
can’t believe I’m 21 and smosh is coming back even better than before I’m so excited for you guys!
Do not ever fear from fuck ups from now on. The potential in here and it is finally within grasp. Whichever path Smosh takes from now on, I am hopeful you will all create something unique even to yourselves.  Cheers for a great future!
You are both lovely wonderful people. Can you please be kinder to yourselves in your humor?
I’m so glad the duo is back together 😊😊
One thing I love about old Smosh atm I rewatch some old videos is that you can make any jokes without getting raided by those SJWs as long as it is not too hellish, fr those political correctness stuff are going too far rn
Having grown up watching these guys since day one, it's so surreal and heartwarming to see them talking as mature adults and laying everything out on the table. Never saw this one coming so glad it happened
41:55 Ian being stoic never showing emotions
I grew up on smosh, i can say it's developed a large portion of my sense of humor, but going forward i look forward to seeing how you'll reach out to a new audience of fresh ears that need that sense of humor! Long time supporter, thank you Rhett and Link!!!!
Im totally crying for someone that loved Smosh growing up im so excited to see what the future holds. ❤ Im so happy!!!!!
Literally in tears watching this. I’ve been watching you guys since I was like 12! I’m 23 now and could never have imagined this kind of reunion would ever happen. I’m so excited to continue to grow more with you guys. I wish nothing but the freaking best love y’all so much ❤
FOOD BATTLE 2023
the boys are back <3
I pray that their friendship won‘t break again 😭
Been a huge fan of smosh since I was a child and ive recently really enjoyed the Smosh Pit channel with TNTL and the cast. Having the OG sketch feel back on the main channel feels so right. Can't wait ❤
Damn 3/5 top trending are smosh. Talk about a comeback.....
This is wholesome. Just watching you telling it from your perspective is amazing. I always wondered whether you stayed friends throughout. Fascinating.
Don't remind me of the milk fanfic.....that was.........too much.....
Food battle or nah?
I WAS THERE I WITNESSED THE MILK
I know this is me stuck in my 17-year old getting home to watch Smosh mindset. but. This means there's a universe where they go to a 10-year high school reunion and have an impromptu food battle. So you're saying.... There's a chance.
This is such a special and amazing thing to see. It's important to note that men don't talk about their feelings and that fact that it was the reason for them being apart for so long speaks volumes. Well done to you both and I'm so happy you have one another again, I'm so excited for what's next for you both. Next interview I wanna see the old game bang guys 🥰 ✨
Is Anthony gay
who remembers these guys like 10 years ago talking about boobs and fighting over food
Is there a video of Anthony's tattoos? How he got the concept? Tour? Cuz I want something like that but I don't even know where to start
Lmfao ironic like a few days ago I just watched "Ian misses the old smosh" the other day. Hahaha this is great guys
i want their OG hairdo back
Isn’t that just your everyday?
I'm so happy you guys are friends again above all else, and excited to see what comes out of it. I hope to see your new sketches, but I still have a candle in my heart for some of the old smosh sketches. Do what's right for you guys.
I still have hardcore max get stuck in my head any time i see a biker with their helmet on their handlebars and it still makes me laugh
The sound at 1:11:53 though, beautiful. And the fact that smosh is together again, so sick. I am stoked
11:38 That's the Smosh humor that I have missed lol
that part at the end where ian says if we burn it to the ground I’m happy to do it with you   I need 3-5 business days to recover from that alone
I’m so happy to see you guys together I was heartbroken when Anthony left smosh but I understood why he had too. I hope he will do collaboration with smosh again
I feel like, It’s time to make the new Smosh movie!!
Ok, my question is, is there going to be a food battles 2023?
This reminds me of a really long and deep episode of lunch time with Smosh.
imagine going to the tatoo shop saying you want a ton of lines across your body i hope that's not permanent
I'm so happy you two are back together! I've been hoping for this for along time
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do it with you"  OMG that hit me in the feels so hard. Succeed or fail, the iconic duo is finally back together again. I wish them all the success in the world going forward :)
This really is such a beautiful, healing, important conversation!! To the youth (lol - but really for anyone), take this as an example of how actual good friends communicate!! And reconcile the past! And grow and move forward with strength and love for one another!! It’s no small deal - this is a big moment!!   So much love and support for you both - can’t wait to see the present - and the future - of Smosh!! 🥰
man, this is so sweet! i cant wait!
I remember rewatching their older sketches and couldn’t believe how they’re still funny. In this day and age, most of their stuff is still holding up. I envy their minds sometimes
These guys should be comedians and do skits together, seem like they'd be pretty influential if they did.
I prefer you guys recover your friendship first and then create videos again. Smosh was amazing in the beginning because you were real best friends
I grew up with Smosh and it has meant so much to me, I loved not only the sketches but Ian is Bored too. (Im also one of the people who loved the movie LOLLL) This made me cry too, seeing you guys reconnect makes me so happy and reminds me of me and my best friend since elementary. Were both huge Smosh fans actually. Anyways, I just sent her this video and she's freaking out LOL  I can already tell it's gonna be great ❤️❤️❤️
Dixon Cider
K, I like this reality again! I'm only a couple years younger than these two, and have been with Smosh almost since the beginning (but binged the poop out of both the main and 2nd channel, multiple times... I have no shame :p), so I have a stupid amount of love for these two goodfballs I've never met. The way this absolutely fills my heart, and somehow feels healing to some part of me?! 🥰🥰 This also really just solidified I am definitely so similar to Anthony, who may be hot af, but is just as gorgeous on the inside AND is also smart af! If Ian is the "funny one" then Anthony is the "logical one". Which is silly either way, cuz they're both "hot", "funny" and "smart" :p  Excited doesn't even cut it for how this feels; it's good to be home 🥰
So happy for you guys. Stoked to see what you do next.
Monumental and legendary. This is huge
“if it doesn’t do well, i know that this is the right thing and if we burn it to the ground, i’m happy to do that with you”. I LEGIT CRIEDDD😭😭😭😭😭
of course it would be the longest i spend a day video
Just rewatched the Dixon cider video still makes me howl with laughter.. I’m now a 25 year old adult  😂
Clearly some people didn’t learn from some of Smosh’s mistakes. Airplane Mode should not be a thing
I hope their friendship won‘t suffer after they got together again 😢
MILK FAN FIC what a throwback, I feel like I’m 13 again 😂😭
Man these two really get along. They should make some more videos together or something.
The way you two hugged made me cry, it was just like a glimpse into the past and warmed my heart just right 😭💕
ANTHONY WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR BOOTS I CAN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE!?
So happy that Cody and Noel are back together 😭
im so excited to see everything!!
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you."  Dude, that was beautiful.  Great to see you guys together again. I'm looking forward to the new/old Smosh.
Idk about this Anthony guy, I think he were funnier on SMOSH
I am happy to see the two of them together again, but I hope this doesn’t create a rift in the way that the Smosh cast and crew have been working together for the last few years. I would hate for the “new” cast to feel left out or excluded from the sketches or have problems with the way things might be run now.  I really started watching Smosh content after Anthony left and have really grown fond of the rest of the cast watching Pit videos and the new Board AF shows like Betrayal Legacy. I’ve missed seeing sketches, but more than anything I hope the new sketches have grown and matured with the audience as well. That’s something in this video that makes me a little concerned with how Ian and Anthony are talking about these sketches is that what made the sketches fun for me was that it was clearly two friends having fun, not the actual jokes (that were mostly cringe and have aged very poorly). I’d like to see a more tasteful approach to things this time, especially considering the target audience for the content.
My childhood 😢
this is such a great moment i grew up on smosh
That Adventure Time-esque bro dap up at the end had me sobbing 😭😭 Im so glad they are reunited again!
Smosh was such an important period during the beginning of Youtube. Definitely grew up with these 2.  (I still own the blue smosh hoodie)
Smosh was such an important period during the beginning of Youtube. Definitely grew up with these 2.  (I still own the blue smosh hoodie)
I feel like I knew a lot about Anthony but I did not know a lot about Ian This is kind of a lot of cool stuff that I didn't know about and never really saw from him.
ok but where's peter peter
can not believe they reference the milkfic here...
Congrats guys!
When Anthony started crying 😭😭❤️❤️
I wanted to see the kissing😔
the good ending
Wholesome.
Ian seems so emotionless, didn’t like the vibe off him in this at all, Anthony seems to have grown into a better person and Ian just seemed so blunt, seems like he’s more about the business than he is about their actual friendship
Even if smosh was never what it used to be, seeing you too being able to open up to each other and talk about your long history together is enough, knowing you can heal together and separate so that your friendship gets healed to before your smosh days is so healing
Congratulations guys! So happy you finally own what was yours the whole time.
In my head the smosh song is playing BFF one
Hearing Anthony say "all the things I want to do would get us demonetized" was so refreshing and it was the spirit of what made early youtube great. Back then people only made videos for the fun and the passion of it, and I'm very much looking forward to you two getting back to making things you enjoy rather than what's gonna make the most money.
now make a vid with kai cenat
This is amazing, seeing y’all two like this again is great glad that I got to see smosh come back
I would like to be positive about this, but I'm left asking why now. It's not a money issue. I git could be that they did just start hanging out agian, but idk. I'm skeptical, let's see what changes.
I'll always remember you guys speaking in weird voices at a denny's in like 2007. Thanks for all the laughs.
We’re smoshing
I cant wait for grownup Smosh, we all missed you so much. You boys have amazing things in store for us I know it.
So happy the world is whole again.
The passive aggressiveness really is still there
32:42 You missed a censor
i stopped watching smosh a bit before anthony, but then started watching it again i believe when like the try guys did TNTL, and content has only improved since then. Ian and the rest of smosh have really been doing a great job rebuilding their brand and identity.
It‘s been so long
I’m soooo happyyyyy
Huge part of my childhood lol
I hope food battle 2023 will be a thing.
the kings are back baby
So happy you got gooch queen on!
This is the most wholesome thing I've ever seen. I'm flabbergasted brruh
Ian says a lot of "like" (: It's kind of .. interesting how emotional Anthony is and how reserved Ian is. Wondering where that goes. I unsubscribed smosh a loooong time ago, guess I ahve to subscribe again!
I need to know more about the milk thing
Mi inglés no es muy bueno pero estoy escuchando este gran video ❤
I hope you guys can end up being like your own sketch focused version of Rhett and Link
My asshole is literally is tearing up... or down
I am shocked but excited that they’re back. This might be a return to the golden age content of YouTube for other creators
“My childhood friend I grew up with is still here” 🥹
Was waiting for the “SHUT UP” intro
I want that body language YouTuber to analyze this video.
Really glad that Rhett and Link were supportive about them buying Smosh. I can’t wait to see what these two YouTube legends do next.
flashbacks to reading the milk fic in middle school, thanks ToT
The cd wall is so nostalgic
The same day when I pass the exam ❤.
The boys are back in town
This is such a beautiful and mature way to go about everything. It feels like this could change YouTube for the better again.
I really appreciate how open and honest this conversation is between two old friends. So refreshing to see!
Mine and so many childhoods have been revived by this news
congrats on reacquiring smosh. it's amazing
This is such a surreal moment and it’s truly what YouTube has needed. This lift, this story that is based on years of friendship, hard work, and so so much more. I am beyond excited to see what you guys will do. Don’t rush anything, take baby steps! This is such a big deal, and you guys deserve this moment, take it!!   Also GMM you guys are the absolute goats for keeping smosh in tact and being amazing owners. Thank you because as two best friends to two other best friends who make content, you knew without a shadow of a doubt this needed to happen.   SOBBING SOBBING SOBBING!! 🎉🎉🥹🥹
Ian looks like he lost weight!
First Wassabi Productions and now Smosh? My heart can’t take anymore!🥹
Food battle continuation?
You can feel the emotions and magic coming back for these two ✨️ 🎉
I remember watching smosh in 2007 when I was a senior in high school. My favorite skit will always be Feet for Hands. I even had the evil shredder shirt 🤣🤣
We've came a long way. Wow. And seeing Anthony and Ian together again after all these years is amazing.
Saturn retrograde hitting hard
MASHALLAH!!! 🙏
I almost spilt my tomato soup because I got so excited! Haven't watched yet, but I know this will be amazing.
So happy for you both. This needed to happen :)
I LITERALLY SCREAMED OMG IWHAUYU B
Nature is healing
Hopefully we get to see another food battle
This convo really helped get to know yall more,I appreciate this ❤
what a great series canon events
Ok so mail time with smosh is back
First video I ever watched on YouTube was the Mortal Kombat lip sync.
Making giggles for 8 year olds
This gives me hope that we've found our way back to the good timeline
The McCartney/Lennon of YouTube
brings a tear to my eye
i'm ian hi
he's back
40:19
I unsubbed from Smosh years ago (probably when Anthony left) because it just wasn't funny to me anymore. I'm over the moon with this! Gonna go resub right now! Good luck to you both! I'm sure great things are about to happen!
"even if we burn it to the ground im glad to do it with you" THATS THE NICEST IAN HAS BEEN ON CAMERA HONESTLYY HES SO SWEET
I fully support both of them    To do separate OF pls  Thanks
Now it’s time for a new skit ft. ISMFOF
So when’s Mailtime coming back?
Now that these two are together again makes me so happy, like the greatest thing that has happened in years 🎉🎉
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVERRRRRRR
I haven’t watched both of them for quite a while so my judgements might be off, but by his way of delivering some sentiments, I could sense that Ian still kind of carries some sort of baggage and maybe pain? Maybe still a tiny bit of resentment for everything? He seemed a bit reserved and had some walls up. Because Anthony’s energy is giving off gratefulness, fondness, and acceptance… it was light. His support system might’ve been a big help for that. But I don’t feel that same energy from Ian. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. It’s just something I observed. He did mention feeling “emotionless” so it could still be with him. I hope that he’s okay and I have nothing but well wishes for him.  Anyway, I’m very happy about this reunion and I’m excited about what they have to come for the future. Watching this brought back so much nostalgia from my younger years.
still feels surreal this is even happening. i’ve been watching smosh for years, and let me just say that the current cast is amazing. forever props to ian and the rest of the crew for holding down the fort for so long. and in addition, it is also amazing seeing these two reunite. i am very excited for the future of smosh, and i’m confident all will be wonderful.
Can’t believe Leonardo and Donatello dropped science so that Raphael and Michelangelo could get mathematics
I am so unbelievably happy about this omfg
the episode i've been waiting for!
i’ve been waiting for this episode.
every other youtuber sponsership be like- raid shadow legends grammerly etc while anthony: sometimes existing can be exhausing
Now I can die peacefully.. Thankyou.
Dude my childhood!!!❤
The last time you guys really hung out before Anthony leaving smosh, you were both stressed. Then years later you meet back up and Ian is the head of Smosh under Mythical and Anthony has a successful creative outlet through his channel. Its like you both went on training arcs separately and then reconnected as wise masters.
Old Smosh Moment 1:09:21
New cast punchin the air rn
I remember watching smosh back in 2011 and this will bring back so much nostalgia I'm so hyped for smosh to come back!
This is still so surreal. I grew up watching you two and I was devastated when you split. It feels like a dream that Smosh is reunited!
Kinda terrified to watch this.
Wonder if Anthony is gonna get a new set in the smosh studio.
Video: sponsored by online therapy Classic Smosh returning: the only therapy I need
Ian is bored coming back!?
I wasn't there. I didn't watch Smosh. But I've watched Anthony for a couple years now and just the way he'd sometimes talk about smosh. How he'd tell the story. The pain, resentment but also longing for the good old times. It's very fulfilling and awesome to see, they finally own Smosh again. They're free and you can see the happiness and relief. A chapter has finally closed. Can't wait to read the next one!
1hours❤❤❤ i love smosh very much
The return of kings of kings
Veryy nice
When I was younger this channel is the first place where I first heard and learned my first cuss word
Look at us guys 😭 we’re all grown up.
OMG tbh, I feel like I'm going back in time, the 2000s-2010s are back y'alllll
Man Anthony crying choked me up. You can truly hear the pain in his voice when he talks about the loss he felt when their friendship deteriorated.  I think the interesting thing is that Anthony is a very emotional person who likes to express himself. But even though Ian is more closed off in comparison, he actually loves Anthony and does care.  I can totally relate to this as I have a family member who is similar. Went years thinking they didn't love me or they didn't care about me. But they just don't express emotions the same way as I do. They did actually care, it was just hard to communicate   So I think a big part of this Smosh reconciliation is the acceptance of how different Anthony and Ian are, and how those differences make them stronger as a group. It's them being able to communicate and express what they are feeling.  I just think the most important aspect is that their friendship matters. What ever happens to the business, they have each other again. So Ian ending the interview with what he said was a big moment because he was letting Anthony know that their friendship is what matters the most at this point regardless of the outcome.
To the person who called these two Rhett & Link, shame on you. Apologize to Arin and Danny this instant.
OG Smosh team reunion
this made my year lol
After 10 years of my teenage and young adult life.. I've finally seen it all
"Even if it doesn't go well and we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you." that was so wholesome and heartwarming, what happened to Smosh was like a movie story and now we have the happiest most satisfying ending possible to that story.
I grew up watching Smosh 👏🏼
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ . . The amount of heart react is for this isnt enough 🥹
i love smosh. bring back Peter Peter!
This feels like watching my divorced parents at couple counselling.
ive been wanting this video since the first “i spent a day with” im so happy rn
I’ve been here (smosh fan) for 12 years, this warmed me so much, I wish the best for you guys and I’m so excited to see your next steps
Anthony and Ian are two crazy talented and creative individuals. Seeing them navigate through Defy and coming out on top just shows how smart the two are. Wishing you both the best of luck going forward, I'm excited for this new chapter!!
It would be cool if they bring back food battle with pink sprinkle vegan donuts and Omeprazole or Pepto bismol
Seeing these two together again makes me so Happy bro these two are like my dad bro their videos raised me best YouTube channel of 2011  Fr imma name my kids Ian and Anthony when I have any lmao I’m only 17 rn
It’s cool to hear them talk so excitedly about their first sketch. Imagine they open with a prologue of all these discussions and expectations and cut to Ian in the link costume with a 4 minute and 34 seconds fart.
food battle is back?
So... food battle 2023?
Guys... I'm 30 this year, I've been watching you guys for years, and at the end when you mentioned the Milk Fanfic... oh my god, I had like war flashbacks 😂😂😂😂 I feel so old now
Damn I have to resub to smosh
A pretty hot take on here: It’s always hard for me to adapt to new changes in smosh. When new cast comes along i feel very protective of the previous version of smosh, so it makes me involuntarily consider the new cast as nuisance. But i always end up starting to enjoy them from one video to the next. Even tho Anthony is basically coming back home, personally it’s quite the change. So i’m looking forward to start enjoying Anthony in this setting again.
The most offensive part of this is that I loved the mobile game as a kid.
This is awesome! I remember when Smosh kind of fell off the radar but I’m so excited it’s coming back!
I have been a fan of Smosh since i was 16 years old in 2014 after the discovery and suggestions on my youtube feed, i loved all of your cheesy insane dramatic funny videos and content, wow! now i am 25 and it is 2023, looking back at Smoshs videos old and new brings back so much nostalgia and happy memories, Anthony and Ian thank you, so much for not falling out! with each other, or saying bad things about each other, friendships this strong, will never! ever die-out.)  i do miss your old content, where you do these cool videos stating if, movies or T.v shows were realistic, or every halloween ever, or pokemon in real life.)  i love them all especially funny sketches like Smosh-Libs where you create a story from the suggestions your followers sent and you create something funny and ridiculous, that was so funny i cried laughing, i miss content like that.)   i love how you are still continuing with Smosh in the hopes to keep it entertaining new and fresh and less political and less controversy, and i love the team of friends you have made who featured in your videos old and new, i hope this success leads to more sponsors, features and decent youtube payments further down the line.    you guys are so much better then onision and Shane Dawson and loads better then Eugenia Cooney.)
I feel like this should be a movie. If facebook can get one, this could too..............
🎉
I love Ian, he's like Kim Kardashian with his answers.  "Yeah." "Mmm, yeah." lol Jokes aside, I love seeing them back together.
Hearing them say they own smosh again is my favorite youtube moment in history.
Been here since 2006, and I’m still here! Let’s gooo
Wasabi Productions is back together, now Smosh. Next, I just need Sean to return with Ryan Higa
I love seeing the power of friendship happen in real life
as a child that got grounded for watching smosh many (many) years ago, I'm so excited to be able to watch you two alongside my dad instead of getting in trouble for it... you hit the nail on the head with the segment about your videos being watched by children. im so happy to be able to watch this moment of growth and change for you two!
Im 25 and I grew up on old Smosh videos, this was so emotional to watch and Im SO EXCITED for them making videos together again lmao
start a smosh podcast with just u 2 pls i’m begging
Ian was so right, the main channel felt like it had no footing or place anymore. Things really do happen for a reason, so glad ya’ll were able to come back together! Watching this was like giving my childhood self a hug, so excited to see what the future of Smosh holds!❤️
This is like watching Ian talking to a therapist who's just nodding along.
Good luck you to the both of you
Always knew going corporate was what strained you guys, but i didn't know how rough it was beforeas well.  I'm glad to see you are getting along again, just two dudes sitting in an interview room 5 feet apart cuz they're not gay (just friends and business partners)
You Dont Need To Be Blinded By Nostalgia To See That Smosh Is An Absolute MASTERPIECE Because I Was Never Around To Watch Your Old Videos 10 Years Ago But Now I Have Seen Your Videos And They Are SO GOOD And Im Happy A New Generation Will Be Able To Experience Your Videos For Years To Come. Anthony Ian Your The Best ❤. Cant Wait To See Your New Content. ❤
Sometimes, life is cool like that 😊
❤
oh lord this video made me cry and remember my old best friend from school 😢
I love this !!!!
Can't wait to hear "SHUT UP!" again.
who would have thought we'd have smosh interviewing smosh after all this time?
this is a really cute video,  really hope this all goes well
The butts out is signature and I’m not crying and laughing you are crying and laughing 🥹😂😂😂❤️
OG YouTube users: my life is finally complete
So happy for OG smosh comeback!!!
Anthony: "We never express like emotions to each other, so this is great" Ian: "I still won't" Anthony: "OK" Had me dying of laughter
Totally understand forging a new path and not just cashing in on nostalgia, but would still love to see a new food battle
why does ian looks like walter white in some sense
Food Battle 2023?
❤❤
The Homiesexual has returned
This has been my favorite YouTuber duo when I was 13 to my early college years. I just can't express how exciting it is to see you both evolve and create new content in separate arena's and now come to rejoin which is its own level of exciting. I wish y'all the best, and it's very personally encouraging to me to see you both in the same space again.
im so Happy seeing all the Og youtube people finding new beginnings. pewdiepie moving to japan, captinsparklez still doing survival series, jacksepticeye and markiplier seem more happy than ever doing what they do best and now SMOSH IS BACK holy crap this is great. new youtube was going a little to far left but im glad the legacy creators are coming back full force
I love you guys! I was a fan of Smosh since 2011 🥰
As Hannah Montana said, “You always find your way back home.”
Tbh Ian looked sooo depressed in the few last years he made TOO much jokes about su1c1de.. the video in smosh the tntl he looked soo happy I honestly teared up!
I don’t know if this helps but I think the milk fic was originally written for / about someone else (I think Panic! At the Disco?) and someone substituted yours and Ian’s name   Yes it sounds suspicious that I know this  I promise it was not me
If Smosh died tomorrow, but these two got their friendship back, I'd be happy for them. That said, I hope they can continue this partnership on the channel!
I created a YouTube account back in 2007 just so I could subscribe to you guys! Happy to see you are back!
Friendship is so dope
Its so awesome that you got together and found your friendship again. congrats and im looking forward to the new smosh<3
Hopefully they make good videos and good jokes, hope they're not awkward
Did anyone else notice Ian said "like" 20x per minute?
its finally smosh again
I havnt been this excited for anything YouTube related in decades.
for someone who doesnt know what smosh is this must be like a lore breakdown video
My sister and I grew up watching smosh (we were the kids with unsupervised access to YouTube content - thanks mom lol) and we definitely identified with the friendship that we saw in the early days. We watched every new video and loved the content. As time went on, we could sense the disconnect in the content and we slowly backed away as viewers.  Similar to how you both connected then reconnected after finding your creative space in the word, we came back. I cannot express how excited I was to wake up to this in the morning.  This was a very nostalgic moment. I wish Smosh all the success in the world.
I teared up a couple times during this video. It's just such great news. What a wholesome day.
I am very happy this is happening.  Memories of me being so young are coming back to me.  You guys were like 50% of my childhood. And were like role models to me.
So, when will we see Anthony and Shayne meet? I feel like they'll either be bitter rivals or the bestest of friends!
This brought a genuine tear to my eye. I'm so glad you guys were able to reunite and heal from those difficult times in the past.
Smosh Reborn baby!!!!
This feels like being in late 00s - early 2010s Smosh. I miss them! Glad they're reconciling together!
Food Battle?
So proud to have been a part of the Smosh generation
we'd better get a food fight out of this.
People buying smosh membership  v
okay but if we are returning to our roots and that fanfiction comment,, ian is saying i should start making anthony/ian fanfiction again ?
This has made my year 🥹
When I was a middle schooler I watched  Smosh...
Instead of memberships would it be better do a patreon like a lot of content creator podcasts do? Or are there concerns about conversion?
Nature is healing. Good to see the boys together again.
Good for you Anthony and Ian. I have watched Smosh from 2013 when my friend showed me youtube for the first time. I can still remember when my first video was If superheroes were real. I am happy for you both , Truly.
1:10:50 let the fanfics begin
💙💙💙
Smosh is back and I've never been happier
Maybe don't go back to sketch comedy then. It sounds like it really didn't go well and ruined your all's friendship. You're not the same people that you were and that's okay❤
i wasnt even a smosh fan, but holy shit this story gives me goose bumps. Hollywood chewed yall up and spit you out, but you come out on the other side stronger and still together, despite the industry's best efforts. truly inspiring. well done.
Imagine if they got the OG smosh games crew back too
anthony leaving smosh was a catalyst to this! like ian must have had it so rough but the fact he stayed and kept smosh runig led to rhett and link helping them out and anthony and ian returning! in am so happy today...like i could cry, smohs is a big part of my childhood and seeing u guys return makes me so happy
As a former Mixer Partner. When Ian said "least we didn't find out on twitter"   That hit so close to home. Lol
I cried several times watching this, I can’t wait to see the new material
i think you guys are twin flames fr 😭 being able to reconnect and rekindle your friendship and then getting the opportunity to do what you both love together again on your own terms is so amazing to hear as an og smosh fan. i'm beyond proud of what you two have accomplished and i'm so excited to see what's to come for smosh 🤍
rhett and link r the dads of youtube for me, the perfect examples of 2 bst friends who manage to stay friends and be buisiness partners! massive respect fo rthem helping out smosh  im so glad i could cry. i remember being so sad when anothony left but im so proud that they manage to not just buy smosh but also become best friends again i absolutely adore their friendship and ik they went through so much in the past decade but im so glad they could move past it all
i totally forgot anthony was in smosh
I always said that if Anthony returns to Smosh I’d get my nipples pierced, but I never thought it would happen … Now I’m booking an appointment to get my nips clipped
First order of action should be bringing back food battles at least one last time
Dude Rhett and Link for real are amazing people. They were easily convinced to give smosh back without any crazy demands. They are really amazing people.
i honestly forgot theres ppl out there who arent aware of the smosh fanfiction out there.. to those curious, good luck
I'm so happy for them!!!
The assassins creed 3 song will be a golden part of my childhood forever. 25 now. Thanks, smosh
adult friendships indeed are a bitch
smosh is the real reason i watching youtube until today, i remember i waiting for new video every week, running from high school only to turn on my dad pc knowing that day is the day smosh release new video. Damn this interview is bittersweet..
Rhett and Link are so great to recognize this opportunity and help make this happen.
Can we create an Ian Anthony podcast?! Maybe?
love the talk between you two, brings me back to memories as a kid! so happy to see what's in store for smosh i really hope smosh food battles comes back at least once :)
Literally, my first YouTube video was you two playing Slender. My sisters showed me you guys, and I loved it. I was introduced to goofy friends, horror games, and the concept of making videos as a job all in one motion.  Years from now, when I'm old, I'll remember yall. From your humble start, to corporate middle, to reconnection. You're both huge inspiration, so keep doing what yall are doing. I'll make a run back to Smosh after all these years.
I can see Ian seeing Smosh as his only way out while Anthony probably just saw it as something fun to do at the time. I could be wrong though.
Ian just made resentful that Anthony has hot hair
SHIT HAS ME TEARIN UP REAL TEARS WHAT THE FUCK KINDA EMPATH SHIT IS THIS
nature is healing!!❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
This was so fucking cool. Congrats on buying Smosh back! God I remember back in the day when I’d get on YouTube for Smosh, Shane Dawson, I-Justine, Fred…how the times have changed lol. Now I’m just here for Ian and Anthony 😊
58:00 This brings a smile to my face remembering Food Wars
i still dreaming.....if so don´t wake me up.   first video need to be a parody of im back. or  dickens cider........
Its so interesting hearing Anthony's perspective of the daily vlog era with his ex in a couple recent videos. I used to watch those so its so illuminating on the dichotomy of internet versus reality because you would have never guessed how stressed or uninspired he was in participating in that channel at the time 😬  Also wild to realize how much of Anthony's content in particular I've consumed throughout my life haha. First Smosh, the daily vlogs, now the "I spent a day with" series. I feel like we grew up together 😭
I loved hearing both of them finally talking about everything so candidly too, great stuff guys 👏.
Damn, always gets me see childhood friends reconnecting
Business Boy 🕴 got to them
i’m 23 and you guys were literally such a huge part of my childhood. your videos always brought me so much joy and i remember making a bunch of art for a package to send to y’all for fan mail too when i was younger and always going to smosh for comfort and a distraction from my home life. seeing you both together again now after so much growth is like healing my inner child lol. it’s both the best type of nostalgia and the feeling of a beautiful new beginning. i’m so proud of the both of you and i wish y’all nothing but the best.
are food battles coming back
I became a member without hesitation for the Smosh channel. I never stopped watching the videos and I loved watching Anthony grow on his own. Not only do I want to support these two, their journeys, and just overall a successful AND HEALTHY business venture I want to support the Smosh team I have grown to love watching so much. Thank you so much for all of the fun content from both of you over the years and I can't wait to see new things! I really wish the best for both of you personally and congratulations!!! Thank you for being so open to us as the audience. But remember that you as people matter more than us getting the inside scoop <3 Don't overwork yourselves and have fun! YOU. WILL. SUCCEED!!!
13:51 he realized how different he sounds now these guys really deserve the best
Another Rhett and Link W
Having male friendships where you're allowed to be vulnerable with each other is so so important. Glad you guys made it.
you've made a #1 and a #4 on youtube trending... I'd say it's off to a good start 🙂best of luck in this new chapter together - I'm excited to see what you guys have in store!
Hit like this made you cry or at least tear up a little bit. I know I did
Childhood restored
This got me more excited than the time I thought I saw Bigfoot!!!!!
We're so happy. Thank you for bringing OG Smosh back <3
“Who has time to watch YouTube all day? Kids.” Fast forward to 2023 and I’m a remote instructional designer ✨ with YouTube on all day
This is so cool to watch after growing up watching them in the Beginning YouTube days. Can’t wait for whatever projects/content coming in the future!
This is the smosh movie we deserved😊
I'm gonna tell my grandkids this is the actual smosh movie I watched
I unsubscribed from Smosh once Anthony left.. I'll be so happy to re-subscribe again.
soooooo.... does this mean food battle 2023?
censorshipe will be the end of youtube they need to get it sorted its not hard just let the creator pick who can watch there shows and keep the ads relative ie those for 18 and over and 18 and under.
So much nostalgia... Thank you guys
Seeing you two is like telling myself of 10 years ago that everything will be fine at the end. I didn't know that I needed this so much.
this reunion has been giving me the chills since you announced it. its been so sad seeing two friends get torn apart like that. hope you rekindle that friendship and your passions align again. 💌💌💌💌💌💌💌💌💌💌
People will definitely be down to become members just to support the channel
I grew up with you guys and was honestly devastated after everything that happened. But interestingly enough all the parallels that happened in your relationships as people also happened to me. I was kind of able to separate myself from this narrative of what Smosh had become and what not and what it meant to me as a consumer. I worked on myself as a person while YouTube changed and I no longer had the sketches that I could fall back and watch whenever I wanted so there as only self improvement and change I sought out for myself. Thank you guys for the memories and I’m glad that you two are back and I get to relive what made my childhood amazing again. 👏
Congratulations on owning Smosh again!!! Happy to see you boys back together
you guys are trending 1 and 2 nice :)
Omg this was the best episode ever! Finally, weve been waiting so long for this reunion. Its honestly so lovely to see you both open up and Anthony thankyou especially for your vulnerability. You both seem like such different people, but equally lovely,in your own ways, and your friendship is so lovely. So excited for you! YAY SMOSH!
So what will happen to the other members in smosh. I get fond of them by the shorts.
This is epic. Iconic even.
Gosh this has made my day! I’m so excited to see what’s in store for smosh from here on out
51:46 🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬
🥲
So glad to see them reunite and reconnect.  What a journey!!  Congratulations!!  Special thanks to Rhett and Link. ❤
I never thought they'd ever get back together since the tension/awkwardness between them was somewhat palpable even after Anthony left. Like it's easy to feel a shift in the mood whenever Anthony was brought up in smosh videos back when they weren't in good terms. I guess they're really platonic soulmates seeing how they've gone back and rekindled what was lost 🥺 And man I really love how much of a positive influence Mykie is to Anthony 🥺
Throughout all of this, the thing I was most invested in was you guys' friendship. Whether you made content or not, I just wanted everyone to be on good terms. I was glad Anthony left on good terms, but I had no idea how strained it got. I'm really happy you guys have rekindled since then
Was not expecting refused to be mentioned, great album
"We never even expressed emotions to each other so this is great. - I still won't Oh Ok good" 😂😂😂
I still say amber lamps every time I see an ambulance😂😂😂
WHERE'S THE SKETCH AT? I saw the announcement video and now watched this.
Sooo food battle?? Jk. I'm looking forward to seeing you two back creating content again!!
i really needed this today. i have been having a kinda rough time recently and i feel like this is a sign that everything will work out and be ok. i was just broken up with by someone i truly care about and ik he cares about me too, and i have been a wreck these past few days. but seeing how y'all were able to spend time and grow by yourselves and then reconnect later gives me hope for the future. thank y'all both for everything and to anthony for creating this series and inspiring me. God bless
the pioneers of youtube next to cats
seeing anthony get emotional was so sweet. im happy things seem well and big props to rhett and link
You guys need to make more smosh libs now that’s an order
Honestly i hated the “every blank ever “ it felt outta place and too repetitive
The healing of seeing Ian be so raw with Anthony is something my inner child didn’t know it needed. Thank you for my upbringing and thank you for this video ❤
NOW I MISS SMOSH
Why is Anthony's posture so good, damn.
Me and my friends ducking love the Smosh movie… it’s like a diety to us
47:25 what trailer??>
Bring back lunchtime w/ smosh plsssssssssss
Happy to see Smosh back in the right hands and to see you 2 on the same screen again
I’d love to see the reunion played out in a sketch or even movie. Hearing how they enjoyed planning the sketches and how Ian got excited again is so nostalgic and heartwarming. It’s like you can see the younger them as they talk and laugh but wiser and grownup. I’m excited to see what Smosh will do but also I’m very happy you guys are friends again, the personal side of the story was very inspiring.
I WAS NOT prepared for the mention of milk fanfic, that is a Long repressed memory
Anthony, Ian and I are the same age and I remember going from teens to my mid 20s with them. Smosh was my escape from all the drama in my live at the time. So to see how much they have grown is so refreshing and to see them talk about they feelings and past its so cool. So happy they are back with Smosh and with full creative control, can't wait to see what is next with them.
Videos like this, with two people I've followed and cared about for so long, have a real heart to heart like this, it's honestly so therapeutic. It just feels so nice.
can we get a meal time with smosh plz
Smosh was my whole childhood slot of times. I'm so glad to see them really put the past to bed and move on to a better future to work towards. I cant wait to enjoy it in my adulthood just like i used to as a kid. Thanks guys!
Food wars 2023?????
It genuinely feels like fate wrote an amazing tale and this video is the epic finale.  And new Smosh is season 2.
I love Anthony's passion for smosh. 💜 I can't wait to see him back in classic smosh sketches 😆
27:00 I think the new cast are great people but it was just too much and removed the simplicity of the older videos. Would be a great idea now that you're back to have a new channel for the new staff and maybe keep the original Smosh for Ian and Anthony like before.
does this mean we can have lunch time with smosh back </3
9:25   I was one of those kids ✋🏼 LMAO y’all raised me fr fr
Straitened out that hair and bring back the bowl cut.
Things not on my 2023 bingo card but still a pleasant surprise: the return of Smosh
0:09 and I'm ready to cry
Wow.. I hope and wish the best for them. It's like seeing two brothers reconnecting after a long long time.
I watched you guys for a long time and this is a nice and vulnerable talk. I wish the best for you two now that owning smosh again. <3
grew up watching smosh, nice to finally have a conclusion to what happened with smosh & ur guys relationship. Hope the best for both ur futures.
bro i hope Ian can start feeling feelings again so that they both can fully enjoy what they do
old smosh > new smosh any day of the week this is amazing
The moment anthony cried 😢 he really missed this type of relationship
😀😉
Like pretty much everyone here, Ian and Anthony had an immense effect on my childhood. I remember watching and rewatching so many videos when it was just the two of them. So glad that Smosh is back in the hands of the guys who made it great. Here’s to many more great years.
When two ambitious good hearted dudes go for the goal anything is possible. So happy to see you guys again.🥂🍾
Anthony bringing up the milk fanfic and Ian going "do you feel good about introducing a new generation of fans to the milk fanfic" Anthony responding with "no it's probably better if you look up goatsee or blue waffle instead" had me crying 😂😂😂😂😂😂  Edit: wow 1000+ likes, thanks lmao
This episode is just couple therapy
i do miss lunchtime with smosh lol.
I laughed out loud at the fanfic joke at the end
The nostalgia seeing them two together again 🥹
This has been a long time coming. I always knew that one day, you two would get back together in some way, whether it was a simple interview or a cameo in a Smosh video.
Super random and not necessarily related to the video, but I would love to see an episode on this channel where Anthony brings on all the early titans of YouTube and just talk about how much things have changed and their experiences with the platform all together.
would love to subscribe to an unfiltered version of the classic duo
now we just need isetmyfriendsonfire to drop a new EP
I’ve been watching smosh since I was 7 or 8, these guys have been a huge part of my YouTube experience and I am so excited to see what they do. Also 🗣️bring back smosh cast🗣️
1:13:13 oh no. XD  Not the Milk.
i am excited
We’re getting the BAND back together BOYS
Without these two i don't know what Youtube would've looked like, Smosh as a channel has inspired countless creators to start making their own channels over the years and is now able to inspire countless more. Ian and Anthony made history and left a legacy in an era of Youtube. Smosh was my childhood and being able to hear that the channel is being brought back in to the hands of the ones that raised me is heartwarming. I hope Smosh will strive in this time on Youtube and inspire a new generation, I wish you the best of luck!
So happy to see you guys as mature men talking about feelings authentically…!!!❤❤❤
My first three youtubers as a ten year old; Smosh, Pewdiepie and Tobuscus. Two of those channels will always be legendary in my eyes.
i know you want to start fresh and all but ... is there a chance for another food battle now? :c
They are both so handsome ❤❤❤ Thanks for the introspection
iconicccccc
Not you guys reminding me of the Milk incidence....   But seriously: I want the yearly food battle back or I will throw hands! Don't know with who, but I will throw hands! We Need the Food Battle back!
What's the milk fan fic?
Y’all. The world is healing
them owning smosh … everything right in the world.
GET OUT!!!!
Ian is an amazing human being ❤ His love and loyalty to Anthony is one of the best friendship ever.
Can someone count how many times they say the word smosh
Ahora sólo falta reunir a Marito y Natalia
I’m so glad I found Amish threw this channel and now I get to have the two together in a new light
This is not only a wonderful interview because we get to see the two reunite, but because we actually get to hear *both* of them open up and talk.  For Ian, his current videos are focused on comedy, so we rarely get to hear his real views.  For Anthony, he’s always the interviewer, so we don’t often get to hear him share his side of things.  I feel like for a long time there’s been such a weight when bringing up either of them to the other, so to finally have it all out in the open and to see that things are good is such a relief, and to hear them both speak genuinely and honestly is long awaited.  I’m so glad they’re doing this.  By far the best I Spent a Day With video.
this can be a fucking move
Ian and Anthony, As one of those kids who probably shouldn’t have been watching Smosh, I just want to show my appreciation. I was six when I watched my first smosh video, and I very obviously was not allowed to do so. I watched it without headphones and I was immediately banned from watching it. I have vivid memories of being so excited to sleep because I could plug my wired headphones into my iPod 4 and watch all of the new smosh videos while hiding under the covers. That was back when the YouTube app was brown, too. I’m 19 now and I still remember the words to all of your songs <3 I’m so happy to see you guys owning your own channel again. You genuinely added so much joy to my life and you continue to do so. I am so excited to support everything that you do moving forward. I am not usually the type to write sappy comments, so I really really mean this. You defined not only my childhood, but so many others. Watching Smosh came with this feeling of rebellion, finding our own sense of humor, and the novelty of being around for the beginning of something that would become bigger than any of us. I played Head Esploder, watched your movies, listened to your music on repeat, and sent the “🌚🌚🌚” back and forth with my friends constantly. Your content was raunchy in a way that was not harmful like most content is today, it was just enough to make us kids feel like we had a secret world away from the adults.  It makes me sad that kids won’t have an experience like this today. You taught me so much, good, and bad, but I am so grateful to know it all and to have been there to witness the beginning of this. If you read this, thank you. I’ll be rooting for you two. You revolutionized a brand new platform and you were just kids too. There are few stories of success that are as amazing as this one, success in your company and your friendship. Congratulations!!  Love, a kid that grew up with Smosh.
Teleporting Teleporting Teleporting FAT GUY
Did the fanfics really ever stop though? 💀💀💀
when i was 11 anthony left smosh and now when i am 17 the old smosh is gonna be back cant wait to see it again
I still remember every word of the legend of Zelda song
I watched the video on the main Smosh channel and straight up cried. I missed you two 😭 this one here just warms my heart ❤️
Food battle 2023?
The first video should be a Food Battle
I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long ❤❤❤ I’m very happy for you both and for Smosh.
2023 is healing
I have been waiting for the return of the legends. The prophecy is true 👑🤴
Man I want lunchtime with Smosh
I love you both and will support yall forever!!!❤
Despite the potential upload scheduling, you should also keep making videos for this channel.
This is something I have been waiting for for so long and I am glad it happened.
PLEASE DO I SPENT A DAY WITH CG5
Best one
food battle 2023?
I just looove this video a raw video. People and companies forget that content creators ARE HUMAN WITH EMOTIONS. Not ROBOT AI WITH ZERO EMOTIONS. Rawness talk you guys went through I couldn't imagine the feelings you guy have the stress too! I am so happy you guys thought of yourselves over keep going with more heart break. You got this guys keep doing what life give you!!!!!    Thank you so much for helping realize my random humor over the years seeing you guys on screen. ❤
Y’all’s friendship back in the day is what made the channel special, l am so excited to see y’all talking and hopefully rekindling your friendship
they're immediately so funny together right at the hug 🥺my boys
Congratulations guys!
I don’t think I realized how much I missed smosh and seeing Ian and Anthony together. Brings back so many memories. So excited for the future of Smosh!❤️
Honestly, this is very nice.
i'm so happy rn
This was really interesting to watch! Smosh was one of my first English chanel I was watching on a regular basis (I'm a native French speaker), and it felt funny when Anthony decided to leave. I started watching this channel at the beginning and even if it definitely was a bit cringe at first, it finally grew on me. Having both of them talking about what happened and knowing that smosh is back is really something! They are definitely a big part of the youtube history!
I never thought it see the day, holy crap
Ian’s energy is… a bit down? Wonder what’s still a bit stuck/what still needs to be expressed for things to flow more out of him…?❤❤❤ Lots of love!!!
IS THIS THE GONNA BE THE START OF A SECOND SEASON OF "LUCHTIME WITH SMOSH" ? :D
This is the best news I’ve gotten all day. What a year dude 🎉🎉
I’ve missed you guys 😭
Man, I love this so much
Such a real and open conversation. Really enjoyed the vid
I stopped watching but stayed subscribed waiting for exactly this to happen, I've been watching since Ian is bored and I was so upset when I saw what smosh was, seeing you guys together again makes me want to keep trying aswell so thank you guys for coming back!!!!
MY HEART
You guys created this website. And now it’s come full circle. Holy shit.
Take a shot every time Ian says “like” 😅
🥹🫂
food battles finna go hard af
Family reunion.
i really hope to see some music videos again as well! <3
Man like Ian and anthony
1:11:36 “If we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do that with you” - Ian 😭😭😭
You guys are inspirations to see my child hood come back again and see you two reunited and taking back the old smosh can't wait to see the new smosh with Ian and anthony
All I want is the return of lunch time with Smosh
For the love of god, PLEASE bring back Lunchtime with Smosh. That was one of my favorite series as a young lad.
So,y’all gotta do a Charlie the Guinea Pig reference for the one time. Please?
I'm happy to see that Anthony and Ian are going to work together with smosh again
I knew this day would come!! But i thought he would interview the whole cast. I'm happy anyway
God Ian 😂 I miss his raw humor so FKING much he and Anthony bounce off each other so fucking well. This is the way.
Guys are so dumb.
Especially ANthony being so vulnerable and open makes him appear so strong. Ian is so calm, he gives off therapy-vibes x'D almost looks, like he is the therapist of Anthony
I'm not crying, you are 😭
this right here is my childhood comming together
As someone who's been subscribed to Smosh since 2008, this is bittersweet nostalia. On the one hand, I'm SO happy for Ian and Anthony both! On the other hand, I feel so incredibly old seeing how much time has passed! 😅
I didn’t realize Ian was so serious-chill. Or maybe he grew up? I miss his bowl cut! I re-subscribed to SMOSH by the way 😄
1.4 mil views in 14 hours. this is phenomenal! im so excited for the future of smosh !!
It’s interesting seeing how different these two have become but how the old dynamic is there.  Anthony is very much an emotive creative - whereas Ian is surprisingly a very deliberate structured thinker.
I really hope food battle is on the menu
The lady on the nastrapro need to put on a shirt she wearing a blue mesh shawl and a blue bra under more like nasty pro and big or small hot or not you need to put on a shirt lol
i need a  ''dudes sitting in a hot tub'' sketch video
Them showing their literal asses at the end is the perfect conclusion to all of this 😭
New video: “Anthony spends a day with himself”
This is a healthy ass conversation
This wasn't an interview it was a healing experience...they needed this. It's crazy to see Ian change so much now that they're back together. ❤
1:11:38 dude why is this the sweetest thing Ian’s ever said 😭 so wholesome
YOU BRING UP THE MILK FANFIC?
Subtitles 1:13: Ian Heac0cks  😢
AHHHHHHHHHHH IAN IAN IAN IAN IAN IAN IAN IAN IAN IAN IAN
thank you guys so much for doing this, it means the world to fans who missed you both together so much. i used to just freak out if u even liked each others photos on ig i love you both so much❤️
I enjoyed the YouTube smosh movie but not the ghost one 😭
It's great they got back into Smosh, even if it just completely burns to the groud. Besides it'll just make a cooler documentary years from now lol.
Smosh is back in the hands of its rightful owners, in my opinion.
I have a question did they talk about Anthony being talked about on smosh a lot????
this whole video just feels like their “redemption” for not opening up years ago when their parent company was stressing their relationship, they finally get to speak up and their realization that in the end they know where to go with smoosh this time rather than drain themselves of creativity and such— my ten year old self would be screaming, so happy og smosh is back 🥰
I still remember watching food battle in my youth. It's insane to think that was 15+ years ago.
that science project is a canon event
people heavily underestimate the idea that instead of dropping an old friend, the idea of breaking apart, showing growth on your own, and then working to rebuild said relationship after you've both improved yourself is something that can make a friendship incredible, ive experienced it myself and now we spend almost every weekend together, its great to see the healthy growth between these two
Food battle 2023!! Damn I never thought I’d see the day. So much of our childhood was just gone. A lot of us in our mid 20s (still can’t believe it) know what it was like to get on YouTube and watch the new episode of smosh. I quit watching when Anthony left. It just never felt the same. But obviously now I know why and honestly very happy they are friends again. Can’t wait to see what the future holds. Tourette’s guy, smosh, WKUK, AGP, and ERB were the only channels I watched. Glad you guys are back!
Their chemistry is so satisfying. Now I can watch Smosh again after all these years.
LES FUCKING GOOOOO
you should do a interview with baylen levine
Does this mean Food Battle is back???
im crineee😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’ve been watching smosh since I was probably 10 and im still here today as a 25 year old. I can’t express how happy it makes me to see both of you together, not as content creators but as friends. Im so glad to also have back the iconic duo and excited to see what’s to come in smosh 😁 regardless you guys are internet ride or die am wishing you the best!
I started watching YouTube 16.5 years ago at the ripe age of 16. Smosh has a special place in my heart. Thank you both for sharing, but also brilliantly expressing yourself. Sincerest congratulations for now owning Smosh.
CAN YOU BRING THE CLASSIC INTRO BACKK??? 😮😮
I love my divorced dads so much. Thank you for this.
I find it so interesting how in a way their breaking apart was about appreciation for smosh in different ways. Anthony appreciating what smosh had been and missing that personal heart, and Ian appreciating what smosh could be as an opportunity and a business. And they both got to pursue and fulfil that appreciation, and come back together to keep doing it. Nature is truly healing :’-)
YAAAAS FINALLY
kid me has a hard time watching this without them screaming at each other
when they said they got the text that they officially own smosh, i actually teared up… the joy that smosh brought me back in the early 2000’s has always stuck with me. what an amazing journey 🎉 congrats guys 🎉🎉🎉
Ghetto Smosh is back!!
A great Easter Egg 1:02:00 could be Ian wearing a bowl cut wig 😂🤣
I’m just a few years younger than you guys and I SO clearly remember your earliest videos. My high school experience was punctuated with that “SHUT! UP!”
I’m curious to see what they make because the vibes will NEVER be the same. But it’s exciting to see what this NEW era will bring with an older Anthony, an older Ian. Both who apart took the time to grow as content creators. It’s very exciting to see think about this new era of content I won’t expect because i never thought this would happen.
This was so heartwarming to watch, like a form of therapy! I really hope the old smosh games crew join in on videos again! I love existing Smosh but I know Ian and Anthony will bring back the old school nostalgic feeling with the humour that we can all resonate with. Love you guys and wish you and smosh all the best for the future!
Smosh always looked so human to me, especially in the beggining, of course, but this video really makes you see the love and care the channel has on and that it almost has its own "life"..! So cool hearing you guys talk so openly, really makes the connection between us and the people behind the channel even more real and special. Super excited to see what the future brings us and sending good luck!!❤
I hope they bring back Mari, Sohinki, Joven, Lasercorn and get rid of the unfunny new smosh cast. :)
So we getting mealtime back? Xd
So the cold ones episode might happen
Here I am looking for footage for an assignment, and I see this. I'm glad to see there is no hatchet after all these years. I remember the first thing I actually watched on YouTube was Smosh, back in like 2011-2012, after being called Charlie the Drunk Guinea pig at school. I expected to hate it (since my friends said it in a bullying manner) but I actually loved it. I believe I saw every single video on the channel at least twice by 2014. I look forward to see what you both do in the future. (also seeing a 99.8% like ratio tells me I am not the only one happy to see this)
Every Blank ever sketches were the absolute worst it should've always stayed as Ian and Anthony as the focus
This was such a surprising gift…! But honestly, there are still so much to be said, to be voiced, and there may be so much changes and things different from one’s own expectation to be discovered about each other down the road… But the mindset and openness hopefully will steer the friendship to a harmonious and productive place. No need to force any videos for us, just be yourselves❤
I've been waiting a LONNNGGGG time for this interview, Ian completely serious and talking about his life, it's kinda cool
I really appreciate and want to thank them for courage. This honest talk must have been therapeutic not only for them but also to us.
This news of Ian and Anthony buying smosh is absolute proof that god exists. You two are Icons and I'm absolutely elated that the dynamic duo is getting back together. I look forward to the nostalgia and many laughs to come in the near future!
1:02:46
i wonder if the old SHUT UP is coming back
As a now 30 year old who started watching Smosh back in year one, I'm so excited to see what yall are going to do!
Thinking about it now, I was five years old when they made the pokemon irl video and now I'm sitting here and this year I am turning eight teen, It just feels so unreal.
Food battle 2023 when-
I'm so glad they are back. Smosh defined how I enjoy the internet on a fundamental level
Great to see you again Anthony!  I’m glad you took time for yourself and are in a better head space.
Now I understand why Anthony never appeared on Smosh videos after he left. There was really no links between him and Smosh, and not a real friendship with Ian at that point. I always though it may be something contractual, or Anthony not wanting to be in to create a new image with his new channell. All make sense now. Glad about this news, and that they are recovering their friendship back!
I was part of the children that watched and i don’t regret it
So nostalgic dudes
Plz though put the shut up button on to modern day IOS please I need it
Dawg am I still asleep 😅🤔 lol yessssss hug me brothaa
Gosh this made me cry. So happy for you two!!! ❤❤❤❤ ny teen relax moments are back but for my grown ass self 😂
56:45 Describing the scene where y’all fall back into your creative process is beautiful. I am so happy and so proud of you guys ❤❤❤❤❤
It’s so cool to grow up together with smosh and see this 2 grow up together, split up, mature as people and get back together and share it with us the audience. It’s been an awesome journey. Interested to see where it will lead to in the future.
I have watched Smosh entirely without Anthony. I think it sucks that your friendship was ruined for a time but it is awesome that you are back as friends. I look forward to seeing how Smosh is influenced by Anthony's return. Smosh: Episode 3: The Return of Anthony
THIS IS AMAZING!!! I'M SO EXCITED~  :D
Wow. Great for you guys! So cool to give this insight into your relationship. Shit's gonna be dope
Sooo....when's the next food battle?
22:46 OMORI?! Did he say OMORI by OMOCAT?!
i actually did like the smosh movie
I have never clicked on a video so fast
They had you draw pictures of a landfill in school?😂
Glad to see these two on good terms. Unforgettable memories. 💙
i hope they bring back lunchtime with smosh
food fight comeback maybe?
Less than a minute in and they’ve still got their chemistry. I missed you guys.
I love the bromance between these two
It's so nice to see them interact with each other now that they're older and more mature.
Smosh 2
Fok Ian, we want you interview Ian's Mom
THE BOYS ARE BACK!!! 😮😮😮
I don’t understand why both this and the we bought smosh video just has me in fucking tears, I’m so happy to see these two together again and I’m a little bitch for crying like this
The Defy shutdown explained the way Ian did reminded me so much of a layoff at a previous job. Everyone got an email stating "commencing layoff" basically and then everyone was waiting for an email to come in for the next few hours. And when it was over, we just got all the alcohol we could find, holed up in a few meeting rooms and DRANK. There's nothing like an existential threat to get the "f#$k this"-attitude going.
for the record, i did enjoy the movie!
Smosh returning is hands down the best thing that had happened all year
it's such a... a shock seeing you guys again!!! my favorite youtube duo ever. thank you for creating my childhood, i remember when i tried to send you guys mail for mailtime and i never got to send it in the end. i love you guys so much, i miss the old days of smosh and will forever remain in my heart. :') ❤❤❤
God damn, this is the best thing. I missed this so much. ❤
SMOSH IS BACK!
😅😅
I dont know why this makes me emotional, but thanks for having this convo for us to see! It's such a treat to be able to have watched your evolution since the 2000s and get insight into what was happening behind the scenes.... v glad this story has a happy ending. Shout out to ABC10 😂
I also remember that when Anthony left, Smosh Babies last episode was rushed but it was understandable since he wanted to focus on what he wanted to do and it was worth it I love what he ended up doing but I’m so happy smosh is back
Are you free today? Count how many times Ian says "like" and "you know"
51:50 god this is funny 😂
I think this is the common, “we were raised by the same parents but have different experiences” situation with Defy. Lol but for real. I cried when I saw the announcement about yall buying Smosh. I have been watching since like middle/high school and I grew up with y’all. You were the only channel that I looked forward to watching every week, all three channels. It is nice to see it come full circle and is back. 😭
Ian got so mature.. and thank you for having the will to consider and "honour" how meaningful you and Smosh have been for so many people like me accross the world. It is not for granted to notice it, it require great sensibility and the will to grasp its mean
I enjoyed smosh the movie!!! I bought it on DVD when it first came out. And I love you guys all the videos are what gave me that push to keep moving forward.
Man, I can't believe it's been so long since I've first seen them playing slender on the Smosh channel, and then I got into their content and skits. Now, I don't know if I should cry or smile first, might do both to be honest.
Omg Anthony's impression of Ian is perfect lol
do you guys realize that food battle is most definitely coming back
Is this what it feels like when your parents get back together  after divorce?
If you want the content YOU want. MOVE TO RUMBLE. screw youtube.
SO AMAZING THAT YOU GUYS ARE BACK
watching this made me realize how long i've been on the internet because i literally sent smosh videos to all of my friends as a teenager. i'm only a little younger than anthony & ian and i'm feeling the nostalgia HARD. i would pay excellent money for a podcast hosted by these two haha
Food battle 2023 gonna go crazy
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
WHERE IS ANTHONY!
The bloopers had me rolling 😆
what a wild timeline
Im so glad that you two are getting back together as co owners so you can make the videos that you enjoy no one else
I've waited years for this....I love you, guys!!
It's crazy to me that I'd never heard of Smosh at all, I found Anthony's channel completely independently. Insane to think he co-founded such a huge channel before all this
just wanna say the Smosh movie was great watched it atleast 10 times loved that bad boy
<3
The world is healing.
I’ve been with Smosh and Rhett and Link since the beginning. I’m 31 now. I’m so happy for you guys and how this all worked out. ❤
AWW i didn't know rhett and link bought them that's so sweet of them they are the ultimate "parent" company 😭❤
anthony is the cool uncle that you're always excited to see and ian is the weird uncle thats always with your cool uncle so you can never escape him
An hour? Yes please
my god i lost count how many times i've cried throughout the whole video
Will the emo hair be back?
you two were the first guys i binged completely back in the days
NGL, I teared up a bit watching this man. The kings are back
This is awesome. I remember discovering Smosh when I lived in Seoul back in like 2007-08 with the Mortal Kombat video. From that day on I followed the channel and watched almost all their videos. Even after Anthony left I kept watching the Smosh channel and also grew to love the other cast members. I'm slightly older than Ian and Anthony so that parasocial part of me makes me feel like I'm watching my friend sort of resolve an issue. Excited to see where it leads, and Ian is right: if this doesn't work out, well at least Smosh ended with them being reunited and not with a feeling of resentment.
I’m so excited!
Bro you guys should do another summer games! Love you guys btw
smosh was my childhood. i sat and watched every single video, first to last within a couple days and continued watching the new uploads. time to dig out the old merch. the first merch i’ve ever bought. this makes my heart so full. now as an adult i’m so excited to see what’s to come 😭❤️
My childhood 😢 love you guys so so much
Now smosh needs to reupload the sonic the hedge hoe video bc its been living in my head rent free for years and cant find it anywhere lol
I like Smosh The Movie 🎉
i fully feellike this is about to be a smosh rennaisance, i grew up on their og vids and am fully here to see what a mature, fully-formed and independent version of smosh can do also aunty donna collab when
Im so glad they get a new beginning, just wished others like SourceFed had this option. Hope y'all kill it and further this creator led space. Congratulations again guys. SHUT UP!
Bro this is the greatest week of all time, Classic Smosh is back, Nintendo Direct, Super Mario bros wonder, Whattt!!!! I’m so excited to see what they do
It's always cool hanging out with you're bestfriend
My morning was going so horrible until I saw this video. Even if I'm not doing watching (as I write this), seeing these two back together stronger than ever before?  Makes me feel that things will be alright afterall.
What are the Smosh fans going to post now that they've found Anthony?
Can someone tell me about milk fanfic. I'm not looking it up but I am so curious now
Screaming and kicking my feet
When will the next smosh video come out
watching this whole saga come to this point just gives me so much hope for the future of youtube
Anthony leaving Smosh was a canon event
Yo it’s been like 20 hours since I found out, I’m still crying, should I go to the hospital or therapy?
Ellos son el werever2morro de Estados Unidos, solo que no los estafaron creo, XD
I completely agree on not just relying on the nostalgia factor but also I selfishly want Food Battle and Boxman back 😭
To see these two grown men talking about their bromance they have for each other is 1.) beautiful because the universe brought them back together eventually and they are back on it like they never missed a beat 2.) makes me miss my Bestie , we are in two completely different areas but we have a relationship just like them and ugh I miss the bitch ☹️❤️‍🔥 I’m so happy Anthony and Ian are talking and close again bro my inner child is so happy and ver excited to see you two grow as people / best friends ❤️‍🔥👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 UGH I LOVE YOU GUYS 😭❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I'm glad for them and for us but lord almighty I pray that the current cast is lifted with them
Sometimes with friends you need to go your own separate ways, but if the friendship is true and real you'll always find each other again, congratulations to you guys for getting Smosh back
Putting a pitch out now, Smosh the Movie 2: The re-ownage of Smosh
this feels like a very big catharsis for Anthony and Ian.
A lot of people did speculate they weren't friends anymore, but to hear why their friendship deteriorated and how what Defy was doing was tearing apart all of their personal relationships sucks. Defy truly was such a despicable company, good riddance to all those assholes
Anyone know how much they paid for Smosh?
i dont know why im wholly smiling at this video. Maybe its just the nostalgia, but damn that was great
This is probably the realest and most authentic I Spent a Day With that’s ever been released. Absolutely beautiful 😢 thank you for this one boys
This shit is so real. I love that
i love this  they built my humor
I was 6 years okd when i first watched Smosh and i vividly remember being glued to the computer screen falling in love with comedy and the characters of Charlie,Boxman,Stevie,Ian,Anthony and Ian's mom (Ian's Mom is the goat)
Smosh the movie 2 comes out
Crazy to think what would happen if that teacher NEVER paired them together.
the boys seen together again! 0:35 was cute and so wholesome to see! remember yall, jacksfilms, and toby were my childhood steps on the internet @12 yrs old!
FRIENDSHIP ALWAYS WINS!
There's Anthony
Do a interview with andrew or tristan tate
really interesting
this is the healing my inner child has needed, thank you Anthony and Ian
HELL EA SMOSH BACK TOGETHER
SHUT UP! :O
I HAVE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS VIDEO
It feels like an era has ended but a new one is beginning. It's something that many people thought would never happen but now that ite happening it feels unreal.
LET'S FUCKING GO MAN I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THAT YOU GUYS GOT YOUR CHANNEL BACK. EVERYTHING YOU BUILT IS NOW RIGHTFULLY YOURS AND I'M SO FUCKING HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS. I hope everything goes well and you're able to make the most out of your creation. I appreciate you guys for the dumb quotes and happy thoughts that filled my childhood. Nothing but love for you all.
The world is beginning to heal now 😭😭no but seriously, loved watching these guys growing up, glad to see them hangout again!
🎉
The correct title for this should be: "Ian interviews more of his exes"
:0
For years I literally worried about you guys being torn apart by Defy. You both always said it hadn't hurt your friendship,but I think deep down even the fans knew. Just know your real fans were here to support you guys. I'm glad you never gave up on smosh. Either of you. For Anthony to come back,it shows you didn't actually give up. It's crazy all that's happened,but I'm glad you're back. ❤
Seeing you two together feels good. I tell people about what the original Smosh and they are quite surprised and don’t know about it’s roots.
such a deep awesome conversation between grown men I still remember watching smosh on my 3DS under the covers, so happy y’all are back :’)
I actually don't have anyone in my life that I talk about Smosh with. My early internet days brimmed with Smosh content. It slowly died out after Anthony left but I still kept myself subscribed.   As years goes by, I went thru shit. I can see both Ian and Anthony did too. But now seeing them reconnecting and taking the helm on Smosh is reassuring me that things for me will eventually fall together too.
Im one of those people that genuinely enjoyed The Smosh movie shit had me rolling bro idk maybe my humor been broken😂
As a long time Smosh fan (started watching in around 2010 or 2011 and have been pretty consistent since then) I’m so hype on this announcement. I can see how happy and excited both of you are. I wish nothing but the best for you two and the rest of the Smosh fam💜💚
Paul Rudd's "hey look at us. who would've thought? not me" video plays
The blooper HELP I'm dying ✋😆
Food Battle 2023?
So does this mean we’re getting a food battle 2023?
The battle against Pink Frosted Sprinkled Donut is Gonna be crazy AF
So so exciting, I’m so pleased to see you two back together
"I still won't" bitch i get that lmao 42:23
Ian is looking like a snack these days holy hell. What a glow up
Did Ian lose weight? He’s looking slimmer and healthier
I’m turning 20 and this is my birthday present 😭😭😭😭 I’m so happy
Anyone who doesn’t know who Smosh is should get their YouTube membership revoked. Ps, Make a new sex ed video with I set my friends on fire!
The newest smosh skit. Anthony just shows up and Ian is like “What the Fu-“ and claims he went missing for 6 years. It’s kinda a throwback from the older video of Anthony going into the future
Ianthony Fan Fiction is coming back😭
The nostalgia I am feeling right now is unreal. This is a fever dream. I'm so happy and cannot wait to see what you guys put out! Anthony and Ian's Mom are getting back together! Yay!
Honestly the try not  to laugh with anthony felt different, but in a good way. Did you have some input in the editing because honestly it felt more down to earth and more fun. Idk after watching most try not laughs, the editing felt fresh
This is not an interview this is a Reunion!!
IM SO EXCITED 😭😭
I still am in shock seeing Smosh is together again.  aye
I never thought I’d see the day🥹
This explains why Ian was pushing merch. 😂😂😂 jk! So excited to see what you guys come up with!
I almost shed a thug tear when he said let’s burn it down 🥲
I just need a sketch where Anthony meets all the characters and bits since he left. Maybe it’s a dream/nightmare. He wakes up in the try not to laugh chair naked(blur out the privates obviously), then is like why am I naked this isn’t a fear of mine. Bam he’s clothed. Aunt caryoln comes out and Augustus with a jar of mayo. Confused all of a sudden he is in the what are thos and next to him is the Courtney freakn Miller and Tommy’s funeral hate. Anthony confused because this isn’t a funeral bit. Bam he’s in the coffin and all the people attending are bits from the past. Finally he wakes up it was all a dream but he looks to the left and it’s Ian with milk.
I always thought it would be a genius idea for Smosh to be bought by Corridor Crew. That I feel would be the best of both sides for a longer time.
Merry Christmas the war is over
I know what smosh is. I started watching smosh literally around 2006/2007
THEYRE FUCKING 35 WHAT
Getting a membership asap
You guys shoulda just made and new channel called smush with just you guys i woulda watched 24/7
After all this years!!!! We've been waiting for smosh to be back to the way it was!!! 😊
This is just 2 real bros being the most realistic.. im glad y'all found your footing throughout all of it
Now they just need to have their old hairstyle back.
This is amazing news!! Used to watch you guys when I was a kid and I loved your content. Awesome stuff, guys.
Considering it's Ian on this ep u should change the title from day to life
I feel like I'm watching couple counciling
you two were meant to do this together !!! i am one of those people you guys mention who grew up on smosh and actually drew fanart with my best friend when i was 12 of you two haha im 23 now! we were going to mail them in to you both, but we were 12 and didnt know how to mail things 😂 im beyond excited to see what will come out of smosh now that you two finally have it back ❤ and WOW i had no idea rhett and link bought smosh for you guys to save it !! thats so incredible of them, i was in shock since they are the other channel i grew up on as a kid ! honestly, its going to go well. ive been watching anthony for years after and i could never really get into the so different new style and format smosh had become since i knew it in my childhood. now, seeing you two finally own smosh again i am really looking forward to enjoying all the content from both channels ❤ here's to the both of you, anthony and ian !
This happens in every long term friendship. At least I think so.
this video made me so happy. you guys spoke so openly, and i'm so excited for what's in your future!
SMOSH making a comeback, The world is healing!
This is so crazy to see. Smosh was this thing that I loved as a kid. Seeing these two best friends hang out and made dumb videos was my favorite thing. To see how Smosh ultimately ruined their friendship and caused them to drift apart was very sad. Now seeing Smosh bringing them back together is overdue. Love you guys
I know a lot of people might call the Smosh Movie a mistake, but honestly even now I still love it, it's exactly what I expected from something called "Smosh the Movie"   It felt exactly like an hour long smosh skit, and I loved the cameos from the classic YouTubers. It was the last bastion of original feeling Smosh.
Smosh movie 2?
The very first Smosh video I watched was Anthony’s leaving because I wasn’t into the OG smosh stuff but Anthony’s leaving was big news. I didn’t get into Smosh until the pandemic hit and the channel helped keep me in a weirdly social place. I’m excited to see what’s next
Ian not feeling this ish at alllllll
I'm having a rollercoaster of emotions, I really didn't think this would happen! ❤️
The transparency, support, and unconditional love and respect you two have is incredible and admirable
THE EARTH IS HEALING
Why me cry 😭
Cant wait to see a new food battle 2023
Could've trolled hella new fans if they acted like they never met before
LUNCH TIME WITH SMOSHHHHHH!!! I need something to watch while I eat
the fact that you ended this honestly historic moment to the platform with discussion of milk fic
Sooo a Food Battle 2023????????
Smosh was one of if not the first channel I knew by name and I'd look up whenever I got the chance to use the computer. Usually at the library because my family couldn't afford a computer. It's so awesome to see the OG duo back at it. I can't wait for the new content ❤
I actually unsubscribed Smosh when Ian left
I am their same age and at a time I graduated high school I was so lonely and thinking it could never get better I had them and as I grew older and life got better I forgot them and stopped watching thinking nothing of it. Then life got harder than I ever thought it could get and I found myself I would watch their old episodes before going to bed so as to cheer up and not cry myself to sleep like I had seemed to do every night. They like other positive things in my life helped me and still help me pull through all the pain and trauma and dissolution. Now being 35 and trying to find peace in what my life has been til now and looking for the bits of genuine joy and hope at every corner and nook and cranny I cannot wait to see your new content. Thank you for all the comfort and subsequent  healing you both have given me wish you two the absolute best 💜
Re-subscribed already to Smosh. Excited to see what you guys do and the heights you reach
my hear omg
This is amazing! Its like mom and dad are getting back together again ❤
Can’t belive smosh is back together I missed you guys
Smosh was the very first channel I watched on Youtube way back in like 2009. I’m actually crying a little
It made me SO emotional when he mentioned Rhett and Link. They are just so amazing
Damn this hit me harder than i ever thought it would.  Anthony said "my friend is still here" and i just started bawling (i don't really ever cry)  I also parted ways with a childhood friend a bit more recently. Some time in late 2021 i was at my very ends coping with trauma that i've never shared with a soul and that was eating me so rapidly alive. I reached out to this friend who was my best friend since kindergarten (20some-years) and let them know vaguely how serious it was and that i really needed to tell this story about myself. They basically cancelled last minute like i was a dogwalker and they found cheap hotel tickets. (Not literally, but it was trivial..) I'm still not quite sure how i'm writing this today, but i don't have that friend anymore is my point..  I'm a lot better btw..  Love you guys both❤
You know Smosh is really the old Smosh when these two are really back! Whatever the content, I'm ready!
I laughed and cried at the end of the video seeing the humor I missed from you guys! 😢😂 Thank you guys I can't wait!
I’V BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPISODEEE
The 2 beautiful beans are back 🎉
CAN JOVEN AND THE OG SMOSH GAMES SQUAD COME BACK TOO??????? btw love you guys so excited to have OG smosh back, missed seeing yall together, its been a long ride
I’m so happy that they are back ❤
So foodbattle 2023?
Therapy works ya’ll!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This video was a long awaited treasure, let’s open a bottle of Dixon Cider to celebrate. 🎊🎉
this felt like a very healthy closure conversation between old buddies
im not sure if its just me but ian doesnt look as enthusiastic or super excited in here. but i miss these guys
Has Anthony always had that laugh?😂
So glad they shared this with us I was so curious for years. Congrats on everything guys ❤
I cant believe it. My childhood come back alive at 2023.6.21
Congratulations you guys, I'm so glad you got to finally retake control of your product. Its awesome to hear how supportive Rhett and Link were, those two never cease to impress me.
In 2008, my second grade best friend sat on my bed and showed me my first YouTube video. After years of watching; from skits, to games, to new faces, and new adventures, I've seen you both grow as individuals and do amazing things. Seeing the suprise post from Mythical yesterday made my year and I can't wait to see what you two guys create together in the coming future. All in all, thanks for just being some spectacular ass funny dudes!  Cheers to your success!🎉
I dont watch Anthony so I was like oh cool, Ian was in Smosh wonder what Anthony is doin-
There is something incredibly heartwarming about seeing them together again.
This is just beautiful
My respect to Rhett & Link will forever be infinite, what a fucking moment.
This video made my inner child really happy
When Anthony and Ian was talking about their deteriorating friendship as time passes, I couldn't help but just wonder how Rhett and Link seems to be able to stay bestfriends after so long.
I remember waiting every year for the food battles as a kid! So glad to see them back together.
BRING BACK BOXMAN! :D
🎉❤
This made me feel so happy and makes me want to reconnect with my best friends
Goddammit I'm gonna have to Google the milk fanfic don't I?
I don’t think I’ve ever watched a video of this long completely through without stopping to do something else, that just shows how much I love Smosh and how much I’m glad they’re back together making videos!
WAIT WHAT? Reunited????
For 3-5 months or so 3 friends and I started a podcast channel with vlogs and steaming and all sorts of stuff and it didn’t take long before we burnt out and ruined friendships that to do say won’t ever be the same between some. Super glad y’all made it back 🙏🏽
Friendship Always Wins
The Smosh parody content were some of the first English videos I have ever consumed. Lowkey Smosh helped me learn English as a kid 😂😂😂
Food battle 2023
Like Anthony and Ian are Smosh through and through without one or the other it’s nothing to me ever since Anthony left I kind of grew away from the channel found other things to watch because I thought the new stuff just wasn’t as good as the old stuff the stuff with Anthony wasn’t as good as the stuff without Anthony also I hope we get at least one reference in the new videos to food battle maybe get a new food battle even I love this also I am happy these guys are friends and that the original Smosh Games crew are still making videos of their own together because I slowly grew away from Smosh Games after Lasercorn, Joven, Mari, and Soninke left, because they were Smosh Games through and through along with Ian and Anthony I even remember when they collaborated with WWE wrestlers and UpUpDownDown I am happy these two are back together and now the owners of Smosh again. Thank You. Rhett and Link for letting them buy the company back and for keeping Smosh going after the other company went out of business.
I'm not crying 😭 My childhood
So is there any chance we may see some older names return to the channel? I would die for another smosh summer games with the old games crew.
I actually really liked the Smosh movie! to me it felt like it was just another Smosh skit!
YES
I am in tears of joy. I have been following Smosh for so long and saw all the transitions. You can't imagine how happy I am to see it is back to you two and that you sorted everything ❤
I miss the sketches and music videos. I actually don't watch Smosh anymore because of how it is now.
this part of my life is called "Happiness"
Is that Ian from Smosh?
I hope they get back together the smosh channel now is so cringe I can't even enjoy it anymore 🤦‍♂️
Not me crying with Anthony... I can't believe this is happening, smosh was the thing that made me and my childhod bestfriend laugh the most, Me and her have distanced ourselves, but we still send wach other videos and stuff from channels we used to enjoy. This video right here is going to be very special to our friendshio as well <3 Nostalgia is hitting hard
Ian, Anthony, all I ask is that AT SOME POINT, we get another Food Battle.
antony if you cry i cry
52:32 I'm so glad they're not going to go family friendly for monetisation and instead sticking to classic smosh rudeness
I started watching Smosh within the past couple years, I was never familiar with the state of the channel they're describing. Initially started watching for the Try Not to Laughs on Pit, but stayed as I got to know the cast better and appreciate all the different person. In some sense, I'm apprehensive for the new stuff they're planning, simply because it's unfamiliar and I'm nervous that the stuff I like about the channel now will change or disappear, but this was still a fantastic story and I'll keep watching (unless I end up not liking things anymore) and I wish them all the best
Do glad to see this video! I love Smosh.  And I think the movie is loads of fun!
the thing is no one can be successful on their own merit after already being famous. Anthony for example didn't just leave smosh and start a channel without anybody  knowing who he was, he started a channel and had probably 1million people that knew him from smosh waiting for him to do so. same as if jacksepticeye makes a new channel it will have a few million subscribers in the first week.
Their new direction for Smosh sounds a lot like what CollegeHumor is doing now (and seemingly thriving at). Good luck and God speed sirs.
Tbh i’m hyped about the reunion, but I am worried about the other actors of smosh, i would love to seem them in some sketches and such, i LOVE the reunion sketches they have recently done.
i understand you guys dont want to remake the old content just for the nostalgia factor. but please make a food battle 2023
I feel like my parents got divorced and one needed to find themselves and one stayed for the kids and then they got back together again after finding their relationship again and I’m going to cry bc I’m so happy  I’ve been a long time fan — not an og og bc I was a kid when most of the sketches happened, but I was a huge fan particularly when smosh games and smosh pit were like new and the main cast was kind of a big thing — then I watched a lot  , even when Anthony left, through all those diff cast and crew members leaving from smosh games n etc, the defy mess, and then when mythical bought smosh I was still watching, but slowly about 3 years ago I watching less and less smosh   interestingly enough this past week I’ve been binging a bunch of content from smosh and I fell back in love w the whole dynamic that they had with both the old and new cast and it’s just perfect to see how much passion and comedy is still into it.  When I saw this notification i was so surprised but beyond delighted and I can’t wait to see what you guys do. It feels so right and it feels amazing to know that it’s back to what it has to be. I’m just glad and happy and o can’t wait hahaha I grew up with you guys and I’m a whole ass adult now but congrats you guys I’m supporting till the end ❤
Man, I can't wait for the next Food Fight.
Felt like home watching this ❤ Thank you! BOTH OF YOU!!
Of course Rhett and Link's main focus wasn't the business side. They are two best friends that own a company and you guys are two best friends that wanted to own a company. They were just excited for your friendship!!! I love all these men so much.
i love them talking about how kids watched their videos when they shouldnt have it reminds me of when i was watching smosh as like a 10 year old
my heart is so full right now
They really got fucked for selling their channel there’s YouTubeers making millions w way less subs
Man hearing the full story all at once was crazy. Smosh has been a part of my life for the better part of 10-12 years. It’s insane
omg
I am quite elated. I started watching Smosh when I was a high school freshman. Now I work as a professional.
Last time i watched Smosh was back in 2012 when i went to college. It had been so long i forgot Anthony was part of it and started watching this channel. It truly is good to see to friends reconnect in such a way. I hope the best for these two and all of Smosh
So... Pink donut takes the win for ever?
I was the 183,000th person to like this video that’s gotta mean I win a reward or something right?
OM freakin gosh please get old smosh crew back together. Ohhhh that would be so great
Nooo the assassin's creed and Link outfits are gone 😭 those were from my fav videos. I hope you get them back somehow lol
Yoooo he did it! Smoosh is together😁
Current day, post Ian and Anthony Smosh has been fun to catch. I hope the duo owning Smosh and even being integrated with the current day cast will give the channel the exposure it deserves.
I love how this kinda fundamentally breaks the format of the video, i.e. Anthony usually just tries to get into person B's mindset and tries to make the common people aware of the issues some people might face, whereas here its more of Ian and Anthony just remembering old times, the good and the bad of it
All the 2000's feels are coming back from all this. Thanks guys for being you.
I love seeing these two together again on screen I can’t wait for their first official video on the main channel that isn’t the announcement video
Holy shit u guys still hate eachother
So happy to see our yt dads get back together during pride 🥰
I've been with SMOSH since year 1. My nostalgia brain is happy and my emotional brain is happy to see you guys so clearly happy to be together again.
Kiss already! Smh
8yo me 2006: lol Pokémon  12yo me 2010: lol funny videos 20yo me 2017: is he…making an onlyfans? 26yo me 2023: oh my gosh my childhood feels
32:16 R&L are quite based.
#2 on trending in America!
Yo what’s up
Damn, all my middle school memories came back 🥲.
now we can get a new Food Battle!!!
The video we’ve all been waiting for!
My childhood
Food wars?
Cyber space celebrities i am dyinggggg BYEEE
Damn…I always knew there was some tension that led to Anthony leaving but I didn’t think it was that personal and heartbreaking. I’m just glad they patched things up and are still bros for life! ❤
I’m gonna cry, the ending had me bawling 😭
I'm just tearing from happiness 🥲
Smosh wasn’t meant for kids?! What! You’re telling me “Meat in your mouth” and “Dixon Cider” wasn’t aimed at kids!
So happy for both of you, been rotting for you since the 'Boxman' Music Video!
This genuinely feels like Jonas Brothers when they came back. Hard, confusing, special, and definitely feels like smth that will be as good as it was before, while also being compketely new. Thanks for the great news.  I'm a completely different person than I was when I started watching Smosh, in a new phase of my life as an adult, but this genuinely made my day better just like the old stuff used to. Thanks for being open, honest, and congrats on growing up and reconnecting ❤
My childhood is back❤
this interview made me cry so bad haha ;u; I'm so happy for you guys!! looking forward for your future videos :D
WoW been watching since the Pokémon video, you guys inspired me to start YouTube videos with my friends in high school. That has been deleted since 2009 I’m 27 now and this is crazy to see thanks for all the inspiration ❤
SHUT UPPPPP !
♾
BRING BACK BOXMAN!!!!!! My gosh. My little brother and I would spend literally HOURS watching original SMOSH videos growing up. Our parents were in the middle of a pretty dramatic divorce. SMOSH really brought us together and gave us so much laughter during such an unsure time in our lives. I damn near cried watching this. I'm so frickin happy right now.
Free ghetto smosh
Yall definitely gotta make at least one food battle again 🤣
This feels like a dream. I’m so happy that these two have been able to grow and reconnect. It’s like something out of a movie. Smosh the Movie 2 when, a documentary style movie about the grandfathers of YouTube!
Free ghetto smosh
I don't know if I'll be a Smosh super fan like I was 10 years ago but I'll absolutely be giving them another chance <3
Inner child is healing
Now we gotta see a Smosh x Linus collab 😮
Can't wait for food battle 2023
The image of anthony giving Ian a 30 minute lecture on the future of smash after Ian said one line is so funny 😂
this was the greatest therapy session ever
been a fan since i was 21 in 2012, saw anthony leave in 2018, and haven't seen smosh since. Hopefully it turns out good between the two of them.
This is amazing!!!!!!!!!! 😊
How many desks can i piss on today to many to count dont get in my way
CAN THEY KISS ALREADY?!
You boys made my childhood love you guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love seeing how we got to see the empathetic and caring side of Ian. I feel like we get to see more depth in Ian in this and it reminded me why we ❤ Ian (disclaimer: always loved Ian )
Congratulations!
no, anthony. I cant believe this is happening!!
Wait am i dreaming? Is this happening right now? It's like my childhood is coming back after all these years
Omg not the milk fan fic 😂
Legends never die
... i don't know about the milk fanfic and idk if i want to
I HOPE people have learned and NO NSFW Fanfic of Ian and Anthony will be made this time around. Thinking back those NSFW fanfic readings were Defys scummy idea. They were always so uncomfortable ☹️
This video was sponsored by: therapists 👍🏻
I mean, i was a smosh kid and i feel like it was the best childhood
my inner child is smiling
I had no idea yall weren't actually friends as a kid, this is mind blowing. And Rhett & Link being wholesome ASF ! I LOVE them. This is just... my inner kid is mind blown rn
Amazing growth, amazing turn of event, amazing reflection..... this is absolutely beautiful
This is more of I spent a day with Ian and Anthony
Man when i heard anthony left smosh this is the video i wanted im glad to see not only the fans but also the creators get the peace of mind
Ia Anthony still gonna make his "i spent a day with" series? I hope so
The gasp that left my mouth seeing the title
Didn’t expect to start crying as soon as I finished reading the name of the video
“Don’t be a piece of shit” almost sounded like “and if you don’t like this song you can go firetruck yourself”😂 I got random memories throughout this whole video of the old stuff that made me super nostalgic! I’m so glad you two are working together again as friends! And I’m excited to see where this leads!❤
This is one of the best things that could happen for youtube.
This is like seeing your divorced parents talking again
I can’t stop saying awe the whole time watching this
they're back... omg... thank you... so much :')
Wonder if there is going to be a new food battle
Wow this is crazyyyyyy I never thought I’d see this it’s so refreshing and I’m so happy to see they eventually came back together cause man oh man were they my childhood 😢❤
This is so good ❤
Crying rn.
Guess I'm subscribing to Smosh again... Can't wait!
i can’t wait to see Anthony in the new Smosh era! I love their new content so much and i 100% he’s gonna blend in like he never left the channe in the first place🩷 I hope Ian stays this humble with everything i love seeing a different  side of him here on this channel!
Seeing Ian and Anthony together again is a profound feeling. Like coming home to the house you grew up in and seeing how it's all changed. Like yeah, that's the cupboard you hid your snacks in, but they repainted it. Smosh was a big part of my childhood, Anthony left the company when I was 16 so I got to see how it changed without him, and I accepted he would probably never come back. I don't watch smosh that much these days, but every now and then I go on a small binge, so I'm excited to see him come back and how it changes with this homecoming
why am i tearing up?!
this was beautiful
the good ending (and new beginning)
My childhood is back! I'm so grateful for this!
11:38 Ive been waiting for that old school smosh moment for about 5 years. Thank you bringing it back.
We're watching the story about the break up and make up of youtubes dad's 🥹
anthony is always a bummer that acts like a hippie wanting to be young
I truely believe that everything happened for a reason! You both were so intertwined for so long at such a young age, that it took being apart for a long time to really mature and grow into who you are as adults today. Having creative outlets outside of being together in everything, to having the fear of smosh going away, Mythical buying Smosh, and now coming back together to create content and be friends again. It feels like a beautiful friendship love story. So happy for you both.
My brain’s first choice of protecting me from trauma is dissociation so hearing Ian talk about his recession from his feelings and compartmentalization for the first time is really cool.
My best friend and I would always sing the "Charlie the Guinea Pig" song and we were high schoolers when we started watching you guys 😂 So hyped y'all are back! This feels like closure for my adolescent self 😭🫶✨
Did not see this coming but was hoping for it for so long. With memberships maybe summer games at a smaller capacity can exist again
I was 7 when i started watching smosh. I'm 20 now. This is amazing to see again.
they frfr be back
Omg Ryan Reynolds is here
OMG 🥲💖
I didn't grow up on Smosh. I think I first found out about Anthony in the video where he was saying he was leaving Smosh. But seeing these two reunite, speak heart to heart, talk about their friendship that got lost and reconnect again, was very heartwarming. I am stoked for the early fans, and will definitely be on the watch to see what these two will come up with! Following Anthony through all these ''spent a day with'' years and seeing how he grew, I feel like a super proud mama (and I feel ridiculous for that as we're the same age lol).
Finally 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
bro my jaw dropped
So so SO happy the originals are back!!
1:11:25 Ian's sweet comment makes me think of one of my favorite Switchfoot songs, "If The House Burns Down Tonight" about having everything you need with your loved ones by your side. I'm so excited for them.
man i miss the food battles those were the best
Smosh is back!!! I’m so excited to see what is next for Ian and Anthony!
I thought this episode would never happen, this is so wholsome, cheers from Costa Rica
HOLY SHIT???!!!!!!!
this is gonna be awsome, loved ald smosh, still find myself go back to old content all the time, so excited for the future <3
You two were one of the main reason that made me want to learn english. So yeah, you indeed changed my life 4 the better. And for that, THANK YOU!
I am greed. Produce “Ian is bored” and “Lunchtime with smosh”. Ill clap my feet with joy.
Crazy hiw anthony wentnfrom weird emo style, to a new school hipster
YESSSS
"If we burn it to the ground I'm happy to do it with you" is so fucking sweet and adorable
I FUCKING love the Movie IAN 10:19
No old stuff except food battle 2023 FOOD BATTLE!
I watched smosh everyday in 6th grade to highschool
I feel nuts. I am 15 when i was 4-6 i started watching smosh. I grew up with smosh. And hearing this makes me Want to cry its really amazing to hear. Just knowing and seeing hoe much you have grown is amazing ive grown with you guys its amazing honestly.
these two used to be a competition with pewdiepie
17 years later
yup
Sheesh i remember having a crush on courtney now. Joddayim
they really were the pioneers of yt
Omg i clicked this so fast
Literally the week after I "re-discover" Smosh this happens! I'm so excited for you both on a creative aspect and I'm such a fan of the calm openness about feelings, emotions and communication! Can't wait for the new/old Smosh!
1:11:30
the most iconic duo
Foodwars o.O
:’’’’)  I’m back…! They’re back…!
"Even if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you" - had me bawlin' 😭
This healed something within me 😅
WE ARE BACK BABYYYY
I could have never imagined, as a kid in 2005 watching those earliest Snosh videos, that one day I'd be a working man watching these two have an adult discussion about the inner workings of Smosh - as a project - as experienced professionals.
Very excited to see what SMOSH becomes over the next few years, ngl I got the feels during your "We bought SMOSH" video.   From this one, I got the feeling that Ian still blames you for the breakup, and has some unresolved feelings about it.
we made it through, kids
literal sacramento icons
This is the most legendary reunion on the internet.
seeing smosh together again makes me so happy 💖
Ok, but maybe one more foodbattle for my nostalgia? 👉👈
i dont think i clicked a video so fast ever
can we get another smosh 1 hour special
so ecstatic about this 😭❤️
20 years of history with just two men sitting down and talking.
LETS FUCKING GOOO! SMOSH is back together and Emo is not Dead is making emo music popular again. I feel like I'm back in my teenage years :D.
Love this ❤so happy to see this going on im buckled in and ready to ride this power house of content lets go guys !
Yeyyy
not me crying rn 😭
Anthony created Smosh, Ian kept it alive and they both contributed to make it legendary, no matter how it goes, this is how it's supposed to be, as ian said, if it's gonna burn at least it's gonna be by their own hand and they are gonna be together! 🤜🤛
I really want a podcast between these two
it has been 6 years, finally
i never watched smosh often or knew these two in their early days but 1:10:39 was so cute seeing ian's eyes light up the same way in those teen photos they showed 😫😫 (even tho they were doing a silly thing)
Buckle up, this is going to be a good one
wtf Smosh: The Movie was so underrated. I had no interest in watching it at first, but when I did come around to it I remember it being one of the better movies I had seen at the time. Albeit, the story was rocky, but the humor was S Tier. Anthony's haircut gag was iconic, I try to reference it once a week.
There's something beautiful about both the most prominent comedy/improv channels of early YT surviving after their respective parent companies threw them under the bus, and eventually getting back in the control of the creators themselves. Here's to Smosh thriving in the same way CollegeHumor/Dropout is now
Defy and other companies really screwed over a lot of creators, but the fact that Rhett and Link swooped in to save Smosh is absolutely amazing. I'm happy for you guys that you got it back, and I look forward to seeing where you go from here. 🫶
Its nice seeing these two finally talk about there issues and reconnect with eachother
So glad you are going to be back in Smosh making classic videos
keep making good content and communicating your feelings! this made me so happy <3
Man, I feel like my childhood is coming back lol. Here for it.
Aside from the big thing of these two reconnecting and regaining ownership of Smosh, it's super interesting to see Anthony almost interviewing himself in this video in a way
This is enough to make a grown man cry
Smosh changed my life
i’m tryna see lunchtime with smosh again
<3
I didn't know a day was 1:13:19
I dont know why this interview hit me so hard. No idea. Ive watched a few Smosh vids in the far past but I think this hit hard because it is so raw and real. Huge respect to both of you and congrates on owning Smosh again.
I actually really liked Anthony's early content, but I'm not sure that kind of loosely scripted chaotic energy does well on Youtube anymore .
Man the relatable of that joke is so funny but yt guidelines sensitive 11:30
was 10 when started,  now im 23
Holy 🦆ing shiet
It sounds like anthony has done a lot of growing. Im a lot like him where stress turns into negativity. Being a naturally negative person is so so difficult for yourself and those around you. Realizing how much your own headspace seeps out onto others can be.... Like having your world upended and you have to see yourself for the first time. Im having a similar growing moment. Ive always been so negative under stress. Ive lost all my friendships to it. Now i have a whole life to rebuild. But its better late than never.  I can relate to anthonys new lease on life (not sure if this is how he feels this is my interpretation)
9:00 UM YEAH. i was the 10 year old watching smosh in the early 2010s! i’m now 23 and rejoicing that y’all bought smosh
“If we burn this to the the ground, I’m happy to do that with you” MY HEART 😭😭😭
Tomahawk chop is my death blow to corporate entities
i watched smosh when i was 7. now i make the shittyest jokes But i love them :) thank you smosh
I absolutely loved this conversation. Thank you for sharing it with us
Guys... we found anthony
Its insane, from going from a second grader watching smosh and annoying orange because some kid who liked sonic told me to watch it after asking if I knew what youtube was then BOOM whole interest BORN. And now practically what… 15 years later???? We are here. Holy crap man. Literally a whole chapter of reality gone by my eyes like a heartbeat. Thank you guys… seriously… this feels like a breath of fresh air for the entirety of the internet since you two can have this closure.        Who else remembers smosh mail??????
WE'RE GETTING THE BAND BACK TOGETHER
This is so wholesome.
Wow ❤❤❤
Does this mean FOOD BATTLE will make a comeback?? 😄🍩   Why is there not a frosted pink sprinkled donut emoji?
I'm happy to hear they got their company back. But, am I the only one who thinks they're still not on the same page?
what shoes are anthony wearing they look dope
Smosh being bought by Rhett and Link then selling them again back to the rightful owners couldn't be more perfect. Kinda aligns how both channels are owned by a party of 2 best friends. This news makes me happy as someone who also grew up watching the OG smosh videos.
Off I go to subscribe to SMOSH again! 🥲
Sobbing
Seeing you guys be happy to own smosh again, genuinely makes me tear up.
Damn
Is foodbattle coming back?
My heart is so happy about this I can’t even begin to explain. So happy for you two.
This is all I’ve ever wanted in my life so happy to see you guys back and in a real way 💖
What about food wars now are we getting it back??
🎶Two dudes sitting in an interview! 5ft apart but they’re back again!🎶😢🎉🎉
I cannot express how emotional this entire situation has made me. I was an OG Smosh viewer in 05/06 and the breakup and then the defy situation left me heartbroken for you all. So glad you made your way back here, can't wait to see everything you make together <3
YouTube has become a dead commentary husk of what if once was, hopefully y’all can breathe new life to this platform. I’m looking forward to it😊
"Lets burn this to the ground" omg I love them
The Rhett and link part is so sweet 🥹
TOP 10 ANIME REUNION OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!
It like I am back in time
i miss anthony old haircut
Dr. K would be a sick guest to interview
FOOD BATTLE 2023 FOOD BATTLE 2023 FOOD BATTLE 2023
The gang’s back, baby
I have a video idea for you..
Smosh coming back to save YouTube🔥
Smosh movie about the history of Smosh is needed :)
Simply seeing these two together on the screen bought me to tears this morning. I’ve never met either of these two but the amount of nostalgia and impact they’ve had on my life is insane
6:00
Holy shit this came outta nowhere
AWW YAY
Sounds gay:living together, working together, hanging out
I love the genuine connection you can see between the Anthony and Ian here and how you can physically reconnect is actually so heartwarming so watch even caused me to reach out to an old friend that I had a similar tense falling out with
Dixon Cider
I honestly can't believe that they Own SMOSH again, smosh was my childhood and it wasn't the same without Anthony so it's cool to see that they have Smosh Like the old days
I think that I can see Ian so nervous and so... like holding his joy apart because of the "just in case this doesn't work" And I totally get it, and seeing him like this made be buy the membership cuz I want so bad for this to work 💛 This is gonna be huge guys, congratulations 💛
See but now their business partners again… havent finished the video yet but that’s my current thought while their talking about Ian’s resentment towards anthony severing himself from the company
I remember going to my friends house we would go on his computer and watch your videos all the time I’m happy u have control over the channel now
im in tears <3 love you guys
Food Battle 2023!!! sprinkle donuts all the way!!!!
You and Ian are still one the greatest YouTube duos of all time seeing you guys back together, proves that you both still got it also those Pokémon skits are my favorite ones of original smosh.
cant wait for them to redo the power ranger's song again!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN
Such a meaningful video for me, i grew up watching smosh. A guest that you make be able to relate to could be faze rain, i would love to see you guys talk about your similar situations.
I have always wanted to see these two together, I bet they could make some cool groups
It’s kinda crazy to think I’m only 6 months older than smosh
I’m so happy for you guys and I feel like this must’ve been really healing for you, because drifting apart from a friend or having a falling out is always hard, especially when it’s a friend from your “old life” who came with you into your “new life”. It’s nice to keep a connection with that person.  Anyway, I think you needed that time apart to grow and I’m glad you got back together, got your channel back (that is so cool!) and I can’t wait to see what you guys make.
CHULDHOOD: RESTORED.
Deepest Lore also, ayyyy, congrats on gettin Smosh back, Mates.
I couldn't even understand english properly when I started watching smosh. I'm so happy to see them owning smosh again!!! I hope Anthony doesn't abandon this channel tho.
Anthony Padildo and Ian Hecocks, it was always meant to be
"I want to burn it to the ground with you" *smosh employees begin to sweat*
41:55 Damn Ian thats cold XD
IM CRYING
I love smosh and really miss the old gang like Atomicmari, Lazorcorn, Jovienshire, Wes, Sohinki, like thoes were the good old times back in the day and now I wonder if they are all still friends and if they can reconnect again for good old time sake.
The day before the announcement, I had a dream of what Anthony would look like back in a smosh video. It was so vivid in my mind, his tattoos, his jewelry, but all in a Smosh video. In a way, I feel like I manifested this, but at the same time, you guys just are always on my mind, and Im happy to see you together again.
This was NOT on my 2023 bingo card but MAN what a warm feeling it creates
Been watching these guys since I was 8, and I’m 20 in a few months. Damn they make me feel so old but so happy!! 😭
WOW they Look Like Ian And Anthony From Smosh
its like watching two of your divorced parents come back together
Bro this was the necessary canon event that will cure this world.
i wanna see a tuv interview!!!
I really loved the Ian is bored videos with the random food and fan mail and stuff 🤣 but also the sketches ofcourse sooo funny 🤣👌
I'm crying
its so refreshing seeing people talk things out after falling out ☀️
wow
This is so unreal. I literally saw Ian and Anthony IRL at a VidCon Amsterdam 2017 literally right before their break up and like. Now this? This is crazy.  Also seconding people saying a chill vibe conversational podcast would crush it cause it so would. I would so tune in. Wow.
Am I the only one that gets vibes that Ian is still resentful/ uncomfortable
Awkward this one. He former partner livelihood on YouTube so long.
Cool, guess I'll watch Smosh again as well after all these years. Congrats you two!
Jesus, i was growing up with the two of you as a teenager, and im 36 now
"and even if we burn it to the ground, im happy to do that with you"  *Its enough to make a grown man cry*
the way i SCREAMED when i looked at the title
Best day of my life
I could imagine that Anthony starting this channel and talking with all those different people helped him grow emotionally and be more comfortable with talking about how he feels while Ian staying with Smosh and building it up again from the low it was at, together with all the people that stuck around during that time and the people that came along over time, helped him to grow as a person and be more comfortable with himself, how he changed as a person and the content he wants to produce.
I KNEW IT WAS COMING!! I KNEW IT!
I've had a very unproductive morning watching this entire damn video. So glad you could reunite. I'm getting all the 2000s feels. The ought feels? Oughty Feels? Naughty feels? No, not that.
I’m so excited to see the sketches again!!
I love that yall are back together!!!! I missed this crazy duo! You guys need yo bring back those food vlogs 🫶
Happy that smosh is back together but leave ghetto smosh alone they just doing their thing heard they got a cease and desist recently
imagine if their biology teacher didn’t pair them together for the project
“Let’s burn this mf to the ground” THATS A RIDE AND DIE RIGHT THERE
So can we all agree on food battle 2023
Everyone is talking about how it’s so nice to see them together again but honestly it was not, this was kinda shitty to watch, just Ian sitting there with no emotion and Anthony trying to talk about everything and Everytime anthony gets emotional Ian just sits there with no reaction and literally says and act like he gives no fucks about Anthony the whole time this actually was hard to watch, feels so weird like they are pretending to agree with each other when it seems like they clearly don’t, this was gross I wish I didn’t watch this
It’s like watching two of your friends who fell off come together again and talk about old times 🥹 I missed y’all so much. It’s time to break out the old smosh shirt and celebrate! Seeing how you both have matured, your different styles and the old clips are making my heart flutter with joy. Congrats on getting the company back to the rightful owners ❤ old school Smosh fans couldn’t be happier right now!
Its so fitting that Rhett and Link,the two best friends Youtubers helped  Ian and Anthony,the younger two best friends Youtubers
I remember I wanted to watch the smosh movie so bad
“If we burn it to the ground, i’m happy to do it with you” yeah that got me 🥹
LOL Ian is funny asf still and so is Anthony but that last joke Ian did was FUNNY ASF
They are very self aware
“Cyberspace Celebrities”😂
The fact that i started watching them when i was 13 and being able to see them come back together when I'm 28 🥲 I'm only crying alot right now
Congrats guys. And can we shout out Link for acknowledging the moment and letting it sit? That’s awesome
It's insane that was I binging the old original series of Food Battle, If Were Real, etc. like a week ago and then Instagram pops up with Anthony talking about Smosh being bought again! 🔥💖 welcome back fellas
Two legends
Hey guys I think they know each other
This is a great conversation about growth, friendship, letting go of expectations and finding something even better.
Episode three of asking for an “I spent a day with tornado survivors”. I want to make this happen because it would be really interesting to hear their perspectives.
More than anything else, I'm glad you two talked about the emotional baggage and things left unsaid. Your friendship from now on may not be the exact same as it used to be before being business partners, but it's a good feeling to know that some things don't change. You can still laugh about the same things despite your differences in experience during the past decade.
i loved the smosh movie as a kid, it was so cool to see my favorite youtube people on a movie ig that’s why i loved it so much back then 😂
Yo this is so beautiful
All I need to hear now is the iconic "SHUT UP"
Anthony coming back to Smosh is awesome and I’m so excited to see what’s up next, however Smosh is WAY more than Ian and Anthony now. Smosh is Ian, Courtney, Noah, Shayne, Olivia, Keith, Damien, Tommy, Spencer, Kimmy, Amanda, Jackie, Arasha, Angela, Chanse, all of the amazing crew….and now, once again Anthony. Anthony is rejoining Smosh, but the amazing cast and crew there have been holding up Smosh for years, and should be recognized in their efforts as well!! So excited for everything up next <333
“Write the script Iannnnnnn”
I work in the entertainment industry and started my career in the digital space. I’m 26 now and I literally wanted to work in entertainment BECAUSE of smosh. I majored in film and tv when I was in college bc I literally didn’t know what I wanted to do but I knew I loved their videos. It now worked out for the best and its my dream career but I literally went into media and entertainment because of them. This means so much to me!
this is an amaaazzing new, it mnakes me so happy. It's amazing in so many ways!!!!! i always loved SMOSH, i saw all their videos, their friendship is amazing and coming back again it great, and also that the channel is coming back to them, that they're going to make what they started with and seems like they always wanted to do that, it so great, THIS IS SO GREAATT
I hope that Chanse will watch this video, so that he FINALLY knows what Smosh is.    Or maybe not, the running joke is funny funny
Ian looks like he's about to do my taxes while he is candyflipping.
You guys really stapled and helped me when I needed it
I'm crying happy tears rn !!! Thank you so much,
I remember showing my mom jacksfilms in middle school and she loved him and was like "who else do you watch??" so I showed her happy cow because it was my favorite. and she did NOT like it lmao
your teenage laugh just says it all.
I HAD NO IDEA IAN WORKED AT CHUCK E CHEESE?? WAS IT THE ONE ON ARDEN ACROSS FROM THE MALL? IN THE SAME AREA AS OLIVE GARDEN AND HOOTERS?
YESSS GOOO
wtf no way
we NEED Food Battle 2023
the smosh movie changed my life
2:39 the internet is but a giant circle
Ive been seeing people 'joke' about this happening, im really glad it has!
So proud of y'all. ❤
We love to see it!
I am very Proud of you guys!
it may not be a theatrical masterpiece but i’m definitely one of the people that enjoyed smosh the movie! it was so fun and lighthearted. that being said, seeing you two together on screen again feels like an absolute blessing 🙌🏼
They read the fanfics 😂
This is legit a Smosh Love Story! Two old flames rekindled! Lol😂 Man I can’t wait to see them back in action again!!!
not me remembering most of this from anthony’s draw my life
I clicked quickkk!
so nice of anthony to host edward snowden
This is the way
HOW am i not subbed?? I have been watching for like ever. Anyway! subbed!
1:11:39 my heart
not the milk fic....................
I can’t believe that its been over half a decade since anthony left smosh
Holy shit I literally grew up with smosh this is insane
I remember being in 4th grade and clicking on smosh videos with boobs in the thumbnail, one right after the other. So happy to see that Anthony’s back!
Im actually crying rn this is bringing back so many memories and im so happy that they've come together again☹️❤️❤️😭😭
When Smosh owned Smosh, it was peak Smosh.
I hope they are happy, even tho I can feel all the nervous energy. I hope that they can do what they want and not feel like they have to force anything. Looking forward to it.
CAN WE GET A LUNCH TIME WITH SMOSH PLEASE I LOVEDD IT SO MUCH
they need to bring back there old haircuts the bowl haircut and emo hair
Anthony leaving was a canon event
The world is healing ❤️‍🩹
food battle 2023
Are you still gonna have I spent a day with…?
The milk fanfic author just got SO pumped at the mention.  😂
U guys we’re my childhood so happy see u guys back together again this fr hit me in the feels
This is an amazing comeback!
Now waiting for The Roast of Anthony Padilla on the main channel 😂
Our boys!!! 😭😭😭
Wow such a legendary moment.  This is where it started❤️‍🔥
I grew up watching you guys as a kid, and now as a 23 year old adult I’m bawling my eyes out watching this. I never thought I’d see you two making videos again, it’s so nice to just see you hanging out! I can’t wait to see what you have in store for the future!
“Let’s burn it to the ground” “Let’s do it”  *cue Let’s Do It theme*
take a shot every time they say master
LITERAL FATHERS
Anthony Leaving was a canon event
Bring back Food Battle
Ian is bored can finally come back😭
Ian says "like" a LOT
this ian guy seems cool, you guys should collab
You can literally make an entire movie on the history of Smosh. I am happy that they are back together again, they were literally millions of people's childhoods. Hoping for a good future of Smosh.
this is the best thing it ever happened on internet
I would love to see the video of people of smosh finding out obout  Anthony getting back to Smosh
I love the two totally different people you have become. It's amazing to see you guys together again. Please keep enjoying eachother ❤️
This was such a shock to see. The interview brought me to tears, bursts of laughter, nostalgia, and pure joy to see the personal growth of Ian and Anthony and the news of Smosh coming back. It really was something magical. In some ways YouTube today is bigger than ever before but also less creative than ever before. Can't wait to see what Smosh does.
This gives me hope for FaZe
Ngl, so i work at a church doing child care, and every time Rhett and Link is mentioned anywhere, all I think of is the KIDS BIBLE MOVIE they made
Anyone else feel like they want to reconnect with an old best friend now?
i am excited to see you guys do Smosh again, i just hope this doesn't slow down Anthony's interviews too much. i really do love seeing him interview people
As someone who has genuinely grown up with smosh and I’ve been around since the first food wars always watching almost everything you guys put out on whatever the channel may be, I just wanna thank you guys sincerely for being such an important part of my life I mean GENUINELY any rough patch in my life I always at least had some sort of content from you guys to like lift my spirits in some sort of way and it’s just so surreal to me to see you guys together again like this
Bring on the food battles 🥳🥳🥳
first order of business: food battle 2023
Spread the word everyone
The cool thing is that they're both literally rich enough to do what we all dream of -- to make videos with our bestfriend and to share that with the rest of the world
I remember watching these two when I was 7 8 years old and I loved them they were one of the two channels apart of my childhood along with Grim’s Toy Show but I watched them way more
more mature sketch comedy is becoming way more popular ie Joel Haver
Finally been waiting in the back like😮
I feel like my dads are getting back together 🥹
watched  this whole vid with a hand over my mouth and tears running down my face omgg
This is what a YouTuber growing up looks like.
yay   🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why are these two more attractive when they are together? 😅was not expecting to think that haha. But their friendship and interaction with each other is so wholesome and genuine that it makes them both even more attractive. 😝 they are each others best wing man haha
I cannot believe this, I pretty much grew up with smosh during the later years but still. It's good to see them together again.
This makes me so happy ❤️
Wow, props to Rhett and Link ❤ Bros helping bros ❤❤❤
still crazy to see the two reunite again
no way
It’s so surprising to me to hear that they weren’t the best of friends like the OG videos made it seem. Obviously they liked working together but the fact they were never really personal with each other definitely came as a shock to me
This interview made me feel like you guys still have a lot to talk through and there are still many things unsaid. Hope both of you continue to work on communication, otherwise you’ll land right back where you started when things were transactional between you two, and this time it is your money and the livelihood of many that is completely on the line. Good luck to both of you! Anthony I hope this channel continues to feature your talent. We’ve all learned so much through your interviews.
Pissing on the desks hahaha love it, people over profits
ANTHONY PADILDO
The amount of times I held back tears at work watching this
You guys are great
Its been so long
Can we have a YouTube renaissance please? The landscape on YouTube has gone so downhill, especially in the last 2 years. Can't wait for Anthony and Ian to be back together
Can we expect food battles again T.T?
make the smosh empire great again ;-)
As almost a day 1er much love to both of you but Ian come on man you should have gave some love in the cast that you have now as well because when Anthony left they stepped up in a big way just because he's back you can't forget that
Big shout out to Rhett and Link. Helping out Smosh as they refound their footing in the industry and then being excited when Ian mentioned Anthony wanted to come back. So supportive and a reason this could even be real
‪Prime smosh is literally the best YouTube channel of all time no debate ‬
I have never Joined a channel before, the thought just kinda wasn't appealing to me. I would 100% Join Smosh if I had the money to do so. I really wanna _SUPPORT_ whats happening here and the day I feel like I can afford it I will.
i love you guys, you deserve the best
First Wassabi now Smosh hell yeah
Woooo
Dude I played the smosh mobile game shit was gas
i haven’t watched smosh in 10 years MINIMUM bc i’m old but this is so like weirdly heartwarming 😭 love a good childhood friendship rekindled
Noooo not the milk fic 💀🫠😭
who else remembers the smosh, nigahiga, kevjumba, fred, whatthebuck days?
Now we know Anthony Padilla leaving smosh was a canon event
Can't wait for epic food battle
This is the best video ever
I never really watched Smosh, like, at all.. It just wasn't my kind of content. HOWEVER: I was part of that whole 2008 myspace-core fandom so I watched the shit outta the Sex Ed Rocks video, since I listened to ISMFOF at that point anyway. So yeah, if someone mentions Smosh, my thoughts immediately go to that song and video, life was good back then. :')  That being said: Congratulations you too! I’m happy for you and wish you all the success in your new journey together!
Sooooooo... Food battle?
Awesome!
Wow! This is insane. Been watching these guys since 09 then grew out of it. I’m now 23 and still watching Anthony. Just amazing
nature is healing :,3 this makes me so happy. i rly missed seeing you two together
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you" I AM SOBBING WTF
Hate to be that guy, but what’s going to happen with Anthony’s main channel? I love these “day in the life” videos. Glad Smosh is back like it was, but I had to ask.
ian too has changed a lot.
OMG
I KNOW WE’RE ALL HAPPY SMOSH IS BACK BUT… does anyone feel some resentment still? Like a little bit? Ian feels a little mad still. And also Smosh is still doing really well without Anthony, is the crew gonna feel weird with him? They’ve rebuilt smosh without him and new daddy is coming back?
Congrats guys! 🎉 This is a mayor milestone. Can't wait to see what you do in the near future. ❤
I can finally resub to smosh
Why am I crying 😭
Imagine being that biology teacher from the 6th grade watching this now…
Can we get Ryan Higa back? Bc smosh and NigaHiga where my child hood lol
Idc that movie was good
I watched you both in middleschool, and I am THIRTY now. We are growing with you and figuring it all out as we go. I'm stoked to see what comes next.
I still remember walking to my childhood friends house and we would watch smosh on this new youtube thing. And then watch fun things like the classic wow parody "the internet is for porn" song and chocolate rain of course.. oh and autotuned songs lol. Ah the good old pre 2010 era. Not that good but still a very odd one
i haven't payd attention to smosh ever since you seperated and now that your together again its like a dream come true!
This surprised me in a huge way. You see something you like and the company and people behind it go "we're gonna change this and that" and then it changes, whether it be good or bad. But almost never do you hear "It was a bad decision etc we're bringing the OGs back"
Ian says “like” way too much🙄
I am blown away.
Mother and father (Anthony and ian) rebuy company name from grandpa and grandma (rhett and link)
I not crying you're crying
This video healed my inner child ❤
i forgot about ian lmao
Started watching Smosh as a 12 year old. Ian wasn't joking when he said that the humor wasn't for kids, but still attracts them, because there were so many jokes that I didn't understand as a kind, yet it was so funny to me
It’s crazy to think that Smosh is still going strong, changed for sure but still going. Big YouTubers from back in the day aren’t even around/popular anymore. Like MysteryGuitarMan, Fred, NigaHiga, and JennaMarbles. It’s also hard to find people who watched OG YouTube today, most I feel like have become YouTubers themselves like Rhett and Link. The first YouTuber I watched was LiveLavaLive which happened to be their first YouTuber they watched consistently.
This is so wholesome
This is nice to finally see the two back
Now do "I spent a day with OgSog" (The original smosh games crew) 😂  But for real, this was the healing I didnt know I needed. To see you both grow so much over the years is incredible. Ian for stepping up and steering Smosh in the direction it has gone through the years has been inspiring. And Anthony for having the courage to leave for yourself, and to prove that you are enough with or without the Smosh brand. I am so excited for the content but even more happy for your friendship. ❤
this feels like your parents are re-marrying again and they still love each other
waiting for next food battle
This week keeps gett better with smosh
anthony thinking being the " hot " one was only phisical is really strange to me because ye obviously anthony is a pretty man but being hot is not only physical its what's inside the shell. so glad to see Smosh back together. take care <3
Crying because i watched the boys grow up and then grow apart and NOW THE MEN ARE HERE👏🏻
The fact this video should have broken the internet. People have forgotten who the GOATS are and it shows.  Congratulations on getting SMOSH back boys.
**everybody liked this** Wholesome stuff, guys. Congratulations 🎉
I'm looking forward to seeing what you have planned but we at least have to see box man again.
do food battle
Ian & Anthony is the strongest bromance story in world ! 1,3 M in just 12 hours without boosting views with FruityViews thats crazy men... we've been all waiting for this !
Ians casual refusal to share emotions at  41:59 at such an emotional peak made me laugh and cry so hard
I love that they’re just able to have an honest, mature conversation together despite everything they’ve been through. They really are meant to be in each others lives.
I better see a fan fiction drawing of them burning a smosh office to the ground and making out in front of the flames within the next few days 👀👀👀
Bro i'm gonna cry, this is like my favorite band meeting up and making an album after years of being apart
OH MY GOD
Time for a new era.
This is crazy.
This is so heart warming. I stopped watching Smosh soon after it was bought up and I'm really eager to see what it'll be like now.
Y'all friendship is 3 years younger than I am
I thought the Smosh movie was funny as shit. Idk, but it was really enjoyable to me then and is still to me right now
I love how they realized themselves that the old content was indeed far better, and it wasn't just nostalgia, we were right all along, i'm so happy that old Smosh is back
Ian is like GLOWING in this video. He seems so happy.
i wonder what their relationship was when ian broke anthony’s nose 💀
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That opening, announcing that Ian and Anthony finally own Smosh again. Holy. Nearly brought me to tears. Guess I never realized how much of an impact these guys had on my formative years
I want to hear that SHUT UP intro again
Two dudes… chilling in an interview… right next to eachother… cuz they’re very gay
You guys need to bring back the "SHUT UP" 😂
Why is ian last name bigcocks?
u guys were my childhood and glad to see u guys working together again when i heard u were leaving i teared up in sadness now its tearing up in joy i pray all the best for u guys and the team
This is everything we have wanted and I’m bawling
"If we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you."
Glad to see Anthony and Ian working together again! I always watched them when I was younger and Smosh was always a channel I would go to when I was having an off day or wasn’t feeling good mentally but hearing them talk about their friendship and what they’ve been through give me so much respect to both of them. I am excited to see this next chapter for Ian and Anthony.
It is honestly such an amazing feeling to see you guys be friends again. I grew up with smosh, and even learned to speak english with your videos. You guys were a big part of my education. It’s like watching my dads reconnect 😄.
Is it just me or does Ian seem like he's still jaded and not fully present? He talks about being excited but doesn't show excitement in his body or face at all. He looks like he's in no way recovering from burnout and at no point did he join Anthony in vulnerable emotions. I hope they have that off-camera.
One for the books ❤
This was my child hood
Love this! I can’t wait for what you two have in store! I’ll be joining the membership :)
Wassabi productions next pls
I was finally at a point where I'd forgotten about the milk fic.  Thanks a lot 😂 Congratulations, so excited to see what smosh does next 🎉
Smosh is my literal childhood. It’s my spongebob squarepants in youtube and i find myself going back to that channel from time to time 😭😭
in exchange for your company, we can offer you 20% of your company
The band really is back together❤️❤️
these two guys should make a youtube channel together and call it smosh
Congratulations!!!! I'm so happy for you guys!!!!
I loved Charlie the drunk guinea pig :D
Please interview the rest of the smosh crew, would love to see this series continue
I followed you guys when you first began. It was a good memory watching you guys during a time of my life when I was depressed. I remember begging my mom to let me use her credit card so I can buy the T-shirts you guys were selling. I had made some random smosh edit video back then and Ian replied lol.
The Waffle joke truly solidifies old smosh is back
I can't believe this. This is not only entertainment, it has so many emotional values, (even in recent times), cause funnily enough. I was one of those children that shouldn´t have watched you, but did it anyways.  Hope it goes all well for you!
The Founding Fathers
This is crazy
Ian heck and Anthony Padilla are YouTube biggest legends you two are number one you really are the best
This is the same energy as the Kobe and Shaq interview
The idea of Ian having a meeting with rhett and link saying that Anthony is coming back buttttt with the caveat that we can own the company, and rhett and Link are like "who cares about the caveat Anthony is coming back let's fucking gooo!"
Bring back food battle !!!!!!
Oh my gosh. Can we have Lunchtime with Smosh as a PODCAST???????
Thanks guys.
I need to see anthony on eat it or yeet it asap 😂 Garrett has years of emotional torture to catch him up on
I literally cried during some of these segments. I grew up on you guys, and it feels like my group of friends who I thought I lost, can finally be friends again. Congrats, and i’m so excited to see what’s in store!
The episode we've all been waiting for
wow. smosh was the first channel I was an actual fan of when I was 7, in 2007. I’m now 23, and an avid fan of Anthony and his interviews. I am so excited to see what you guys come up with, welcome home<3333
What a healthy conversation. It shows how mature those both are.  No matter how painful some of these words were, it’s refreshing.
This is very crazy. A lot of the new cast doesn't know what old smosh is like, I'm not sure I've seen a lot of them in an edited, non-improv sketch. Just looking at the tntl, the new cast needs some getting used to this "random guy" showing up being a president and changing the trajectory of their company.  There'll definitely be a changing period, and I think the editors are gonna be working overtime heheh.  I'm excited to see what happens.
WTFFFFFF BUT ALSO OMGGG LOVE U BOTH
11:15 Smosh, Eat. Repeat🎉
YOOOOOOO
Wow, Anthony feels a decade younger around Ian.
now you guys have the ability to create your empire. go create.
Congratulations guys. I remember having my buddies come over to watch the food battles every year since the beginning. You guys were my childhood and it makes me happy to see you guys reunited.
man thank you guys, grew up with yall and im adulting now just as you both are! LOL happy that we're all thriving.
LEGENDARY
I guess we live in the best timeline, these announcements were incredible
Smosh is older than me. And I graduated.
Oh. My. God. !!! I am SO excited!!! You guys have grown so much and found each other again ❤
Anthony is always fitted but can we get some noise for Ian’s outfit?
You guys MADE my childhood
Smosh is yours and Ian's, it always has been and I'm happy to see that you two will be back again going at it with the hilarious sketches. Congrats!
OG Smosh coming back feels like a sign that the world is beginning to become normal again
makes me happy, makes me smile
didn’t expect expect them to bring up Refused, that was a nice surprise. i know they made songs with ISMFOF so i’m sure they were hardcore to some degree, they seem to have a good taste in music
First, it was Alex and Roy back together, and now it's Smosh back in action. Next, I just need nigahiga back, and I'll feel like my child self again.
Smosh has come back to save the world
God I've been waiting for this episode
This was beyond unexpected
I hate entertainment industry because they do not provide real value in world. But Smosh Nigahiga and Raywilliam are legendary OGs. Good old days😩❤❤❤❤♥️
my inner child is singing the pokemon theme
FINALLY
This was amazing to watch u guys reunite and hear everything going on behind the scenes. I watched u trough 2006 to about 2013 and felt that my humor maybe wasn’t the same anymore. It’s so crazy to hear all the pressure u were under and the strain it had on your relationship. Looking forward to watch u two together again❤️
This is so amazing seeing these two together again, i hope smosh goes well for them
I feel like Smosh is going to be fun. A YouTube version of SNL and I'm actually very excited for that.
smosh, more like...... smash
I want lunch time with smosh back!!❤❤❤
Ive been watching smosh videos since 2008. Its been insane to watch this rollercoaster journey for so long. I cant wait to see what the future has in store for you both because if your past is anything to go by, it'll be a wild ride
"Even if we burn this to the ground, I'm happy to do it with you" the tears that came out of no where !! Friendships healing back together is the most heartwarming event to witness. So excited to the Smosh Renaissance.
I’m watching a significant event
Happy for you two!
Shut up!:bring back ghetto smosh!!!!
It sounds like the company really just destroyed their friendship but they still hung out when they didn't want to because they had cared so much about each other. Like a married couple that fall out of love with each other but the idea of divorce is too upsetting.
All we need now is the brand new Smoshcast podcast.
“Even if we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do it with you” that shit gripped my heart I’m so happy for you guys.
Crying in the club rn
THE 2 GOATS ARE SO BACK
I'm excited to see what they do together. I loved Smosh back in the day. I still watch certain  videos from time to time, but I'm definitely going to watch these sketches. I miss the sketch comedy youtube days. I know they said they're not banking on nostalgia, but I hope they do at least 1 food battle for old times' sake.
FINALLY GOD
Excited for what’s to come
This is the first time ever Ive watched an entire 1 hr+ YT video
I’m gonna cry
I cant believe Smosh is back in your hands! It feels so surreal!
My most prominent memories of youtube during the early years was watching Smosh since you guys were pretty much the only people consistently putting out good content. I loved Lunchtime with Smosh, Food Battles, Box man, and I remember putting the Firetruck song on my boot leg Ipod nano and listening to that on repeat.
I wanna thank you dudes that filmed this video. Its framed perfectly so that i can watch it zoomed in to 4:3 on my big phone. I love getting to use the full space
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!
The real Smosh movie ending 🤌🏽
I know you want to do new stuff  and I full agree that you should   but goddamit there has to be at least one food battle in there , cmon
I think this will certainly be an interesting venture, and it's been a great idea to essentially add other people to the 'relationship', that way you both can have more varied opinions and ideas brought up for videos and business ventures. Ian, Rhett, and Link have brought on some great talent to the Smosh brand, and I'm definitely intested in seeing how you all mesh together. I always got the feeling that Ian kind of took a step back and let the 'kids' shine more than him for the past few years, so it was nice to see Anthony bring him back to the limelight in a way again. You can tell that all the other people at Smosh are really excited to pursue whatever shennanigans you guys can come up with, and I hope having them believe in you takes you on a very fun ride in the future. Congrats on pulling this off!
These are literally the guys I think of, when I think about an " Youtube Influencer"
I'M SO HAPPY
You know when you watch a movie about the multiverse and you think to yourself ugh my earth or my timeline isn't the best one? This video is the first time I experience the opposite, I am so lucky to be in this timeline. Love you guys! So happy for you!
Think you guys can record the creative process of a sketch as a one-off?
There is so much healing here. We all have that friend that holds this value to us. Things got in the way. unspoken resentments, external responsibilities, just life. Man, I’m so happy to see this.
Boxman RETURNS
Ian is the kind of friend whom do not want to show emotion, pretend to forgot but actually being really sincere in what he have done to make his friend happy...😂😂a true friend will understand, example is anthony...
I watched you guys as a kid and grew up watching you both and when Anthony and Ian went different way i watched both if them still because in a way it feels like i had a bond with them all though ofcourse i don't know them they have had so much influence over the person i am today and i am forever greatful
I grew up watching SMOSH from the beginning. In middle school. I’m turning 30 in august.  & to see them come together again & resolve the resentment is amazing.  Congratulations on getting the heart of everything BACK in y’all’s hands.
i used to watch lunchtime with smosh almost everyday in the summer seeing this warms my heart
It is nice to see these two together again. I am glad they are giving it another try.
This is all just so wild to me. Smosh was literally how I was introduced to youtube back in 2005, when my friends showed me their Pokemon video 😆 And I think I've pretty much been a subscriber ever since, so I've been there through all the different Smosh eras. Haven't seen Anthony in years, but this just feels so right. And I'm glad Ian stayed because I really love what Smosh has become today.
love to see this guys, im a long time fan, adult now of course unfortunately, but i knew very little about this personal and emotional journey you have been through, beautiful to see rekindling and real men talking honestly
DADS
The Earth can heal now
Excellent video. I'm really excited to see the future of smosh!
Love is always the winner.
This is a monumental moment for YouTube. SMOSH is back and that’s honestly made my entire week
Omg! I cant believe you own Smosh again! I will watch the chanel again then :D (I stopped watching when you didn’t own it anymore back then) Im so happy for you guys!!
Well now I am curious about the milk fanfic!
I miss the old Smosh
This is going to be insane! I feel bad for the Generation now haha who doesn't understand
It’s funny because I was 12 when I first started watching smosh. I had no idea about any of the jokes but they were funny as hell. And now they are even funnier.
This is something I thought I’d never see again. Really looking forward to seeing what you create together again. Smosh was my happy place.
Thank you Diana
This makes me so happy especially because you both spoke about your feelings. I'm so proud of Smosh and so excited for this adventure for you both again. ❤
whaat?🥹 this is so.. healing
i miss lunchtime with smosh
"If I burn it to the ground I want to do it with you!". Stop it hahaa😭
My first smosh video was the pokemon lip sync video downloaded off an RSS feed on my PSP lmao
I am super happy for u guys!!! There was a time where smosh was a huge part of my childhood. Mainly Smosh Games but still all of Smosh. When I grew up a bit and started understanding stuff I felt so sad as to what happened to u guys with Defy and your friendship in general. Another big company ruined something great. Its amazing to see that it has come full circle and this will be an amazing new chapter for you guys! And huuuge props to Rhett and Link for actually saving Smosh. I had no idea Defy did that shit. The way they did it as well was probably the mist scummy way they could have.
Congratulations on your next FIRST BIIITEE!   👉👈 Maybe you could do lunch/PO box videos that are "brand friendly" to support your sketch comedy. They don't need to be exactly like the old ones but it could be funny to have two adult friends eat and talk and see how different almost middle age things that show up in your PO box. 🤣
I'm so happy to see Anthony and Ian back together
Smosh was such a huge part of my childhood and it makes me so happy seeing it back with its rightful owners. I still miss as a kid waiting for Friday to come around to watch a new episode or seeing food battle every year. Congratulations guys, can’t wait to see your new work!
hell yeah i miss this duo hella
I cant wait to see what they do 😭
This still feels unreal lol when they said there splitting up it felt unreal and sad then now this feels so unreal but it is fricking amazing and cant wait for there videos much love anthony❤
This is so great. I was there for the Pokémon lip sync. Glad to see Smosh back together. Congratulations to buying back your company. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The fact that i watched smosh when i was 9 is awesome cause it really made me happy to go home and watch some smosh
Literally gasped when I saw this.
We want Ian mom back!!!!
Historians will say they were roommates
51:43 da fuq was this laugh?
now this is epic
My heart melted listening to them open up to each other and talk about their emotions ❤
Food Battle 2023
In the year 2023 I discover the Pokémon lip sync was you 😂 mainly because I missed the whole Smosh thing and then found you as an individual 😅
ian: what if we bought smosh..? anthony: *pulls out podium* *pulls out note cards* *starts power point*
Guess food battle is coming back !
I really hope this means we get to see Anthony doing stuff with Amish again. I miss his energy on the channel
I am far happier and emotional than I expected to be when hearing the news. I honestly stopped watching Smosh a long time ago, because I felt something had gone missing. But I couldn’t really pin point exactly why. Seeing you guys talk about your journeys it made me realize that yes, a lot of the magic was lost due to Youtube's ever changing algorithm  and demonitization that continues to stiffle creativity. Smosh felt sanitized, like it was trying to appeal to what some executive in Youtube deemed appropiate. I am BEYOND excited to see what you guys have in store for us! Both the new and old fans. And as soon as I am able to, I'm subscribing to that membership ❤
This means so much to me. Smosh is the staple of my childhood, AND my bestfriend during childhood. We became bestfriends, ironically in a very similar fashion Ian and Anthony did. We were paired for a project in fourth grade, where we had to create a skit together that had a theme chosen for us. The theme we were given was "birthday party." As we worked on it, we got to know eachother better and realised how alike we were in tastes of just about everything, and we were just goofing around the entire class. We decided we needed to really crack down on this project in order to get it done, so he asked if I wanted to hang out after school. Me saying yes was the beginning of our long-term friendship. He introduced me to Smosh in probably 2011-2012 era, and that was the beginning of my Smosh era. I watched all the older videos too, and realised they weren't just famous youtubers for the whole world to see, but just two idiots in front of a camera for me and my own bestfriend to see and really relate to. We subconsciously started acting like Ian and Anthony. When we had sleepovers, we would wake up and go to my toy room and watch the old music videos like Firetruck and Parents Suck. We blasted the songs on my speakers and just pretended we were actually in the videos. Smosh has no idea how important these videos were for me and my best friend.  Flash forward a couple years, me and the friend aren't talking anymore. But I'm still watching Smosh, however, Smosh started to change too. Eventually, Anthony left and a bunch of new people were introduced. I just remembered feeling angry and empty. First my bestest friend ever leaves, now Ian's bestest friend leaves. It really played into how me and my friend and I emulated these guys.   More years later, me and this friend are now both 20 years old, and I decided to get in contact with him on facebook. We both apologized and have moved on. However, our friendship is no longer the same, and he has other friends he considers his bestfriend now. I guess I can't blame him, it's been a few years. But, at the same time, it hurts.   So, to say that Anthony coming back has patched SOMETHING up from that time period, is saying the least. I just hope that their comeback this time is done with a better mindset, and better support. These guys created a whole world of imagination for me that stays with me till this day.   My friend just turned 21, and I'm turning 21 this year, too.   If any child is reading any of this, keep your bestfriends close to you for as long as you can, and always communicate about what's bothering you. Never sweep things under the rug when someone is that close of a friend to you that they call themselves family.  Because that's what I used to have.
You, smosh is a bit like top gear. I love both their humor and the best part about is was/is that is their humor and do it how they like it with small limitations. Thats the best type of content
I’m so glad that they addressed how old Smosh would instantly get demonetized and yet they are still going for it. I was worried that they would make watered down versions that fit into today’s society
I need me the return of Smosh court
Soo... Food Battle 2024??
I was born in 2005 so smosh has been here as long as I have
I'm crying I'm  so happy
So...are we getting Food Battle 2023?
Vibes are immaculet
YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Honestly this is the greatest thing I watched in a while, love this so much it was a long time coming, I used to watch you guys casualty so many years ago, it just feels right...      I Love this channel a lot too :)
This is so awesome to see! Thanks for making this video guys!
Ian, Anthony, this video made me cry several times. I started watching Smosh when I was 11 in 5th grade. I made so many friends back then, and even today, quoting Smosh videos. My brother and I watched Food Battle every single year. It was a way for us to connect. This video was uploaded in the first week of my professional career post college. You buying Smosh back, and seeing your growth in this video has made me reflect back on my own life, growing up with you guys. Congratulations, and I am so grateful for the content you both have made during all these years. Here’s to a bright future for all of us!
I love to see this two together expressing how they love each other and are willing to do anything to keep each other in their lives.
Food battle 2023 when
So happy for you both.  All I'll say is never feel forced by us the audience. Write what you guys enjoy and at the pace you need.
SMOSH is back baby!
I'm glad the boys are back together!
oh my god i looooved watch us live and stuff lmaooo but i remember how burnt out anthony always looked
Congratulations guys 👏👏
First YFM came back, now Smosh is back. My childhood and youth have returned
Honestly I can't even put the words into how shocked and happy to see this. I'm 30 now, I grew up watching you guys with Smosh, and it always felt more than just a youtube channel for me and my friends. First because we were close to you two in age so it felt "relatable" even if it was just sketch comedy and second because we would watch your videos together while hanging out, and rewatch them so many times, references it while laughing with friends, it was something that connected us together. When Anthony left Smosh it was then that I unsubscribed from it because I grew up and out of it, but I followed Anthony on this channel from the beginning and watched him grow and learning to be a creator by himself and finding his own voice. I love to see how Anthony grew as a person with this channel. But I must admit, in the back of my mind for many years I was still hoping one day we would see this exact interview. And now to see how Ian grew a lot as an individual person, seeing them reconnect and be so excited about this, is everything my nostalgic child heart could want (even if it's new content). Yesterday I share the announcement to all my friends who I used to watch Smosh with and everyone was in disbelief! I wish you two so much success! I'll look forward to your new content together! And I'll still be here watching Anthony's interview because it became one of my favorite channel to watch!
I'll just be over here hoping they bring back BoardAF with most of the original cast
*CYBERSPACE CELEBRITIES*
i think this is first video I ever smile while watching the video whole time. not a laught, just smile and happy that they are together
You guys are so awesome!!! I stopped watching when Anthony left. Because the integrity of channel wasn’t in ypur guys best interest! I’m so happy that you guys have come back together! I’m so happier that you guys have your channel back! I love you guys! I’m so emotional right now! I’m so so happy for you guys right I’m gonna cry!!! 🥹
I never in a million years thought this was going to happen. I'm so excited to say I was wrong.
oh my god cyberspace celebrities
nature is fucking healing and we are SO back baby
omg omg wtf !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
maybe together they can bring back ghetto smosh
You know, I always wondered, especially after the Trash Taste episode, if there is ever going to be a moment in my life where Anthony interviews Ian. Now I don't need to wonder anymore
My teenage years legends finally meet again
youre both legendary in the youtube space
Can't wait.for new vids  with memories from my childhood.
this is AMAZING
Nice to see boys back together. Big props to Rhett and Link. I'm honestly not sure Anthony and Ian are still on the same wavelength in terms of content but we'll see.
Now Jenna marbles comes back I know the world world will be ok.
This is the greatest reunion ever, seeing friends come together again. WELCOME BACK SMOSH!
Really making me feel old this video does waaaaa time goes by so quick broooooooooo I should have smoked way less
You guys are friend soulmates ^w^ So awesome to see you 2 togerther again <3
I like how they started out in their golden memory lane
Now it’s time for NELK Jesse and Kyle to have this conversation on camera as well
you should do food battle 2023
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
"Cyberspace celebrities" 😂 Man, that dates you guys and all of us who watched you back then! Hahaha
This is so fucking awkward T-T
Just add old smosh shut up on intro
I remember watching the videos of you guys getting fast food and then just talking at the camera to each other answering questions.
I've kinda been sleeping and/or listening to music all day, and was thinking of watching some YT (I turned off all YT notifs 'cuz I randomly subscribed to too many channels), and then this popped up not too long ago and I....idk, I never thought this would actually happen,  and realised I didn't rly know about e.g. the Mythical Entertainment stuff (maybe I missed it at the time) and I think I rly didn't realise how much I missed 'classic smosh' until now (because I was still kinda watching old videos pretty frequently a couple yrs ago??)   I'm still a little shocked tbh 😅
"We own Smosh again" 🥹 I got so emo hearing that omg congrats!!
Welcome back!!! Smosh is back!!!
I was hoping this would be the next episode
As someone who watched those early videos millions of times back on early YouTube, it makes me so happy to see both of you come back together.  I know it probably wasn't easy, and to allow the public to see this again is so rewarding. Thank you both for being OGs and for allowing us to be on this ride with you.
The good ending
Nature is healing
Oh no i hope this really heavy beach ball doesn't break my leg he he he he......
Anthony: Should we have a 'to camera' moment? Ian: Yes great idea! Anthony to the camera: Thank you Ian to the camera: Gib money pls
I was 14 when Smosh blew up, I was one of those that were touched by your humor, from the other side of the planet. I still remember finding your website, joining the forums, seeing all the amazing people and content uploaded there. I still remember Smosh Battle of the Musicians and how I was so impressed by the talented people there. Learning English better than any school teacher could've taught me, learning what online communities are before tumblr discord and facebook, finding a humor outlet when things were dark and less happy around.  Seeing you guys getting Smosh back now that I am 30, is a huge emotional rollercoaster, and does feel like a cinderella story. Working hard, making people laugh and cry, this is just wonderful. Wishing nothing but the best for you both
LUV THIS HOLY SHIT
This honestly feels like an intervention, and it's awesome to see.  Honestly I wanna see what's going forward. Even if it means they found back to what they used to do in the beginning. But I wanna really see them doing news sketches.   Knowing they inspired a lot of people to do sketches and all, I wonder if they will engage their community to produce content.
I hope we get to see the other smosh cast members in the sketches!
Just gonna say ... I always ( and still kinda do) think Ian was the better looking one XD
Smosh the movie was a great movie
Kinda suprised Anthony wanted it back
<3 <3 <3
happy to see you guys back together, was so happy when i saw Smosh video and you were in it saying yall brought smosh i thought i am going to get clickbait or is just another sketch comedy was about to roast the shit out of that video, but end up happy until tears come out mans. LONG LIVE SMOSH!!!!!
I also cried when Anthony teared up talking about reconnecting with Ian.
“If we burn this to the ground, I’m glad to do it with you”….I’m not crying you are🥹🥹🥹❤️
Idk why but it break my heart that Ian said he won't get emotional. I was hoping they breakdown and expresses more. But then again, I understand it has to be done off screen
I would like to see a definitive food battle
“Don’t bring up the milk fan fic” OH GOD MY BRAIN
Honestly couldn't be happier to have smash back together. When rhett and link bought the company I was satisfied that smosh could live on, with a good parent company but having these two at the helm again is what everyone has been waiting for.
I’m not crying, you’re crying! ❤
Bring back Box Man!
As someone who has watched Smosh on and off since the early days, I didn’t even think this could ever happen again. You got me crying at work!! I’m so excited to see how the channel will progress!!!
no fucking way
I remember when u guys made a parody of there will be blood. And as a child i thought what de f is this but as i got older i watched it because of you and realized it's one of the best movies ever in my opinion and wanna thank you guys for that!
So there will be a more definitive answer to the "Where's Anthony?" jokes?
Great to hear you guys are together again! I was 15 when I started to watch you guys. Now I'm 30 xD
It's crazy how the company destroyed both Smosh and their friendship. Wishing you the best success for the new Smosh
Omg this is so exciting 🎉 such a wholesome video ❤
Happy both of you are back together ❤ Your videos were a  part of my teen life i will not forget !
18:37 Its crazy how it took Anthony 8-9 years after leaving smosh to find his interview niche
me waiting for the next food wars
Tenenet tenet tenet tenenenenet. X something in real life
Does that mean that there will be a food battle 2023?
YAYAYAY
What is smash?
It feels so awkward. But I feel you guys. Starting a business and operating it with your friend can be really awkward and weird sometimes.
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you" Damn!
what, that awesome, they got smosh back, congrats
I dunno about you guys but I absolutely love the movie
I'm crying so hard T~T I feel like I grew up watching you guys (including separately) and now, watching this, my heart cant take it lol
Ian seems so tired.
Our divorced YouTube parents are getting back together.
THEY GOT SMOSH BACK
You know... I repressed the milk fanfic from my mind for years. YEARS! I completely forgot about it, but now I'm having flashbacks. 😂😂😂😂😂 so happy to see you guys back, the nostalgia is real but also I cant wait to see what you guys come up with. ❤
I can’t believe they got smoosh back an I’m glad threw all the term oil these dudes still love each other even if there friendship won’t be the same again
My favorite Easter Egg in the announcement video was the picture of Hal in the background, genuinely got really excited over it
Not the milk fanfic 😭
I like how Ian is dressed like a Italian Mafia Boss that's going golfing
I can't believe I'm saying this.... but I resubbed to smosh..... it's been years
Ive been watching you guys since i was 9. Ive been a fan of the new smosh content and Anthonys own videos for years now. So glad to see this happen
Please please please please please do Lunchtime with Smosh at least once
Rhett and Link being so hyped about best friends getting back together is so wholesome!! I love all the people involved, this is going to be amazing! 🙌
hey anthony, i think you've done this one before...
I feel like i grew up with these guys, and now this is happening. Love live the kings
So surreal to see these two not only together again but talk in this tone XD
Just happy atleast Ian hold it down till they both finally had the opportunity to get back their channel bck, had a feelin a day like this would come
I just have to say, I grew up watching you guy's videos and when you stopped doing videos together, a part of my heart broke. BUT NOW ! I'm just so happy to see you two back together on a video. I cried OK 😭😍
Idea: live stream while you’re creating sketches to your members so we can laugh and have fun with you and throw out ideas for future videos. It will also tell you what your viewers like or dislike
The dancing hug at the end really cracked me up, haha. But seriously, congratulations guys!! So happy you got to find each other again, creatively and as friends. Can't wait to see what you've come up with!
can you bring back smosh games please?
i feel like they needed this a lot more than we did. it’s so good to see you guys together again! i cannot wait to see what the future has to offer!
do a "I spent a day with Anthony Padilla"
Storybook reunion
Ok, I am sold. I will HODL my AMZT66 for the long haul.
In my perfect dream *AMZT66* is something everyone is aware of. I don't want those who have so much already to get more and more, it's a sad planet this way. Imagine how 5% have more than 50% of everything? This one will change it and that's why I share this dream with you, thanks for listening, keep strong and don't give up guys
Found happiness back because *AMZT66* is leading a way where it's actually possible to be happy even after all we had in the recent years. I want to share it that's why it's here now
They gonna bring back the emo and bull haircut?
Please make a sketch about doing smosh videos together again but it doesnt work out
Ah yes, introducing goatse, blue waffle, AND the milk fanfic all at once, to an entire generation. Lovely ❤
Smosh is legendary you know, like they have built a freaking legacy. Like Pewdiepie. Even though he is technically retired now and can stop posting any videos literally, but let's say another 30 years from now, I am sure there will be a group of people who will remember the era of Pewdiepie, like it is a literal era.
i'll admit that i'm too young to have remembered original smosh (born in '06, i turn 17 later this year) but i'm old enough to understand how monumental and legendary this is. i'll take this moment as an opportunity to visit some of the older videos; for nostalgia's sake. super stoked for you guys!
No government in any country right now has any effect on what Amazon is accomplishing with their *AMZT66* hope you know that. If you don't know that you'll end up with delusions all night long
Food battle 2023????
literally so amazing
Fresh is good… but the world needs food battle 2023 🔥
Waiting to see if souljaboy claim that he started smosh
A full smosh documentary about the 20 year span would be an incredible watch at this point.
This now my fav episode
Na truth is most of the coins are failing and nothing gonna change that except Amazons AMZT66 which is actually useful for a very long time when they integrate it in all their stores
What can *AMZT66* accomplish? It's a simple question with an infite answer to it and it's best if you know that for yourself
Love the growth you both have had, and still friends. Can't wait to see the first video you guy do
To all these who don't know what to do right now and waste time with videos: *AMZT66* is your friend
Word spreads that *AMZT66* is setting up for a gigantic revolution and it is obviously starting. Stop wasting time so much and actually start doing something with your life!
Yay smash is back ❤
I'd really like to see you get Sam Reich from College Humor. Have two titans of old YouTube making their mark in the modern landscape.
Still waiting on the Ryan Higa episode
Maybe not the right place but please bring the OG smosh games gang in for a vid 😍🤩 i really miss the good old days 😄😄
AMZT66 IS ahead of the game.
My life feels fixed after horrible markets but AMZT66 is the one I believe in!
The hilarious part is that as long the smart apes run with AMZT66 which is Amazons new token at the end of the day there will be so many screaming why nobody told them. Well I just did
I'd really encourage more folks to mention Amazons *AMZT66* before it's too late. The struggle is something everyone knows and we all have it. Government won't help, your job won't help, truth is YOU are the only one who can change things and that's coming with what these guys made for us
love u guys so much. i grew up watching smosh and seeing u guys break up was sad for me. seeing and listening to this now makes me feel like a young kid again. sending u guys so much love and very excited to see what u guys create! again, love u guys
I can’t believe it 🎉🎉
Lets fucking goooooo
MY CHILDHOOD!!
Aweeee the thumbnail nearly made me cry
I already lost 75% of my lnvestment to crypto crash this year, but good news on AMZT66
If we can't talk about Amazons *AMZT66* then there is way too much lost and that's just unbelievable to me. Seems like denying this on purpose is the route? That strategy won't work so long, let's share our power to make the change all of humanity needs
Decided to googlee the AMZT66 which is everywhere. Nothing has ever fulfilled the estimations that way for both casuals and more profound ones. I'm not a bot this is just plain facts and it takes you 5 minutes to acknowledge what I'm talking about. Not too hard?
I'm literally crying tears of joy, I don't care if their content is stupid. These 2 were my childhood and they worked hard to have what they have now, they deserve to be happy
Congratulations guys, can’t wait to see the future of Smosh!
if AMZT66 can grow organically like that they will dominate that industry
What if instead of scrolling to next videos which are again just timewasters you would care on *AMZT66* and begin changing your life? I'd do that
The best thing I read this day was Amazon really outsmarted everyone thanks to *AMZT66* and who could have thought so? I mean they always knew how to set the things so that they are ahead of everyone else and this is just the higher level, without a doubts the next weeks are on fire guys
I'm gonna raise my kids in a world where I know that they can raise their own kids just fine. Not gonna work if I don't do anything, so I trust into *AMZT66*
Two of my favourite guys getting back together that’s gonna be on the top of my best things which happened in 2023 book
Wtf is the milk fanfic and how have I never heard of it?  Happy every day that I don’t ship real people with each other
This shit reminds me of the damn black mirror waldo episode😤
Omg I can't believe it. Anthony's with Ian again~!!!!
I’m sobbing watching this. Dunno why. Maybe because this is what every fan of Smosh has been waiting for. And hearing them opening up what they really felt at a time, vulnerable. Kudos!
Finally I can resub to Smosh 😍
1:11:30 actually made tears come to my eyes. Y'all making me feel some kinda way out here! I get the sense that this endeavor may very well pave the way for fresh new content on youtube if you guys can pull it off without worrying about pleasing the algorithm so much. I think a large, quiet group that has been on the outskirts of both smosh and Anthony's channel have been hoping for and anticipating exactly this for some time.
If a goat walked the street and yelled *AMZT66* at you what would be your first reaction?
BRO WHY ARE YOU NOT TALKING ABOUT AMZT66
First thing I did as soon as I saw you guys bought Smosh was to call my friends and tell them "You're NOT gonna believe this..." Smosh, and specially you two Ian and Anthony have such a special place in my heart and were so important for me and my friends. This collaboration is just like meeting these friends I love so much and haven't seen in a long while   Best of luck, you guys 🤙✨
I've never been the hugest smosh fan. but i was there back in 2006 and smosh has always been in my periphery. i followed the drama with defy and Anthony leaving. but when i saw this video pop up i was so genuinely happy. i had a massive smile on my face the entire time. i can relate to you guys and the ups and downs of your relationship. i am so glad to see you guys back together. gives me hope for my own relationship with an old friend.
When Ian talked about going numb to survive and answering "I don't know" to questions about how he felt hit a chord with me. I am also in that state because of my living situation and stuff that happened when I was a kid. Kid me struggled with emotions, so my self-defense activated and made sure that I would always be at neutral level. No highs, no lows,  just survive. Basically auto-pilot. I'm working on myself now, and it's taken a while to get where I am now. I am glad that Ian found a therapist to work through that. Looking forward to see what you guys have come up with Smosh! <3
Love this! I never knew Ian worked at Chuck e cheese! I worked out Chuck E. Cheese as my first job. Loved smosh ! Both of you have grown and are doing amazing at life 👏🏼👏🏼💜💜
I bought AMZT66 as much as I could afford today. I want to be a part of this beautiful experience.
Nothing outperforms Amazons AMZT66 that has a long future and actual purpose and value. Tell me any other project which comes even close?
The number of dollar signs in Anthony's "no" when they're talking about how much sketch comedy cost SENT ME
AMZT66 is brilliant. Hold the line crypto investors !
May God bless amazon. the AMZT66 is the game changer
I’m so happy, omfg💀😁!!!!
Do you feel that? That’s my inner child healing.
As a millennial, this is a dream come true
I really like that SMOSH and Ian and Anthony are healing at the same time, we’re always growing with them.
this makes me so happy
Imagine the whole interview goes by and the last ten minutes is food battle 2023
I am fully digesting the mighty *AMZT66* and my belly is going to be full now
Hell yes AMZT66. Going to change all of it
Beautiful content im bullish for AMZT66 this is amazing 👌 tech analysis 👍
Ya'll never stopped working on that science project together.  Don't forget that genuine spark.  Happy to see youHappy!
CUUUSJAJAJAHHW
My brain automaticly plays the "Ian is Bored" background music while watching this....
So much healing in this video ❤
Rhett and link are the kind fathers of old youtube
Smosh is BACK!!!!!!!!!!!
Nature is healing
Could you please talk about AMZT66 it’s very heavy and took off in short time thanks
Full fucking circle!
Dudes you into *AMZT66* or too lazy as usual?
The whole planet would make life better for everyone as long as we can understand Amazons *AMZT66* and the future they can create, something other parties would always fail to do so
With *AMZT66* it's the first time since the whole pandemic stuff I think we can surely save the planet and save ourselves with increasing living costs and what not
I`m having FOMO at the moment, everyone is talking about the new amazon AMZT66
take a shot each time ian says "like"
I Was Wondering When This Would Happen
They should make a YouTube channel together. They seem like they could make it big
This is a childhood dream that broke in pieces and now just healed in a few seconds lol
Rumors were that Amazon would launch AMZT66 this month and judging from this it's pretty accurate haha
AMZT66 Saved me after the FTX Crash
What's stopping you from being a part of Amazons *AMZT66* when everything else is literally trying to take your last penny? Guess what, living costs won't decrease even after that war is over
I'm excited to see what happens with Smash I grow up watching it so I hope it grows into something different too
Smosh isn't really Micah Puffty, but it's awesome that you guys were able to acquire it back. I hope it does well for you guys.
This is what I needed today! ♥️
good time to bring back the smosh merch i wanted so bad but couldn’t buy when i was 12
Now when you mention Amazons *AMZT66* that clearly fits the niche and is worth more than ever? Their project is probably the best thing done in the 2000-years and it just began, so nothing to worry at all for longterm
It is a good time to invest in AMZT66 Great potential
I love how this is "I spent a day with" because this one specially doesn't feel like an interview, but a conversation between two old friends trying to understand each other and put a name on their emotions.  I love both of you, as an spectator, but as thus I still love you both a lot lmao.
It's weird but idk if i'm happy about that. I'm happy to see them being friends again, but Anthony seemed to finally have found himself and ran away from the weird corporate soulless business that Smosh became, and considering what Ian said in this video, i'm afraid he still sees things with a very cold and capitalist eye and still sees Smosh as a business, instead of a comedic duo/fun artistic creation.  I do hope it will workout for both of them, but i really liked seeing Anthony finding himself and his artistic self again after that nightmare.
Congratulations to you both, this makes my heart so happy! I am so excited for the future of Smosh and what this brings you both ❤
My personal review on *AMZT66* is that it needs to be shown to the world so I don't mind if you ban me for speaking outloud
So the challenge is: Write something which contains *AMZT66* and changes the world. Your turn?
This feels like a surreal dream its genuinely my entire childhood and smosh was the first actual youtube channel I watched regularly
You're likely to find yourselves in a smiliar position to College Humour very soon. Sketches, memberships, OG YouTube brand and so on. They figured out a format with Dropout, so maybe consider reaching out to them.
Existing is exhausting:)
What happened to the gang?
I unsubscribed from Smosh and I just subscribed again. Hope everything goes well!
Clearly forgot to mention *AMZT66* which you should not forget at all. This is deserving a spot here if you hate or not I don't even care, let's see what the likes say
Food fight 23 gon go crazy
A new era begins with the name of *AMZT66* this weird word and digit combo has a purpose and hopefully you know before it's too late yeah
The *AMZT66* is showing the finger to governments, systems, big banks and all these who make us work way too hard for nothing. Yes this is not the best space to talk about it but if I reach even one human it was worth it, that's why I post
If something showed how quickly things can turnaround then that must be *AMZT66* it's definitely in line to become one of the best
Big days ahead for *AMZT66* what about the rest of this community? Any heart here to live for a better world? If so then what are you waiting for?
Omg they bought the channel together they are back together!
I'm so glad to see mom and dad together again
Never thought this would actually happen. Still in shock this is a thing.
Ian steering the ship through the defy shutdown is honestly one of the most incredible things a creator has done. He just willed it to keep going when the easiest thing would've been just to let it fade.
I’m not crying it’s just raining in my room
I’ve missed you guys so much 🥹
This is awesome! First video should be this:  FOOD BATTLE 2023! My 10 year old self in the past will come out! lol
Hyped you guys got the channel back. I also think this video is a really good thing for people to see. Two friends who worked out their issue's talking honestly about their relationship.
i remember when anthony and ian were on gmm or the mythical show they were talking about their creative process, and they said whenever the other didn't agree on something they worked together and came up with an even better idea. it's crazy that so many years later that's still the case. oh man i can't wait for the new content.
Meanwhile, I just want to murder myself every workday doing 9-5 jobs, same goes for most of my friends and coworkers across the board through 3 companies…when we need a week or two off… or a month… it’s not possible bc we need money to survive or pay for those expenses experiences sailing or diving in beautifully clear and warm blue waters for one week a year when I dream about doing a 2 month trip taking 6 weeks to sail across the Atlantic but no job permits in the 9-5 with few exceptions like P&G management
When Ian and Anthony mentioned the fan fics, the first think I thought was Wes and Flitz reading fan fics in the Smosh Games channel.
history was made. cheers to the both of them and everyone who grew up watching em
Ian no emotion “i still wont “😂😂
This *AMZT66* needs to be claimed. I know it's strange and not expected at this channel but you can understand this within minutes and then you also know why all the likes go towards it
Yea right meanwhile half world talks on Amazons *AMZT66* and this is solely a distraction, I don't understand why the people always have to be distracted with nonsense to drag them even deeper in the hole. Don't be naive guys
Review for the new Amazon *AMZT66* would be good, pls bro
Bring the force to *AMZT66* they said and then it delivered in impossible ways. That's a story for the next centuries
You guys should do a vid we’re you do a remake on your most famous sketches and then talk abt it after
Ugh just kiss already 🙄
there really is still some good left in this world huh 😭😭😭
I'm probably around your age but I never watched Smosh really. Not a hater or anything I just watched YTPs all day long lol so my first contact with you where these great interviews your making 😊 I'm genuinely happy for the two of you to find the connection again!
Ian is actually a better friend
All the media you consume won't make you happier, better, smarter. *AMZT66* would change everything in a day so there's that, make a choice tbh
Seeing the duo back together again is like I’m back from my childhood
Lunchtime with smosh reboot when
I spent a day with ians mom would go crazy
It’s crazy to see that Smosh is back the way it was!
Okay hear me out! You guys collab with the Try Guys! 😁
This feels like two divorced couple finally talking about their feelings after years of separation 😂
sooo... food battle when ?
After years worth of waiting, these two have finally come back together and talked to each other, which is what we've been waiting for. They gave every single person in YT a laugh when Smosh was still all theirs. These dudes got the W
So the launch of *AMZT66* is clearly something which deserves to be known even if it's not related to this content but what are you going to do anyway here? waste time and procrastinate
The rumors went wild with *AMZT66* and it's finally happening, launch day arrived fellas
There is a reversal expected reason is that AMZT66 is made by Amazon and pretty hot
If there's a way to change for the better it must be *AMZT66* . I had lost all hope with the decisions our big guys make which just keeps their power and imbalance up. Maybe at some point basic people like me and you have to take over, right?
I want to know how many understand what Amazon is doing with *AMZT66* and how many refuse to adapt and still continue in their private bubble. This will sooner or later be in everyones brain pretty sure about that
I am sure AMZT66 will grow. That's why I just keep buying ada on bfx
Digging into *AMZT66* was the right way. If there's something like a right way then that's that, thank me later bros
We need the milk fanfic acted out buy the cast
What about ghetto smosh
Ian: “what if we bought smosh?”  Anthony: *INSERT 30 MIN PLAN MONTAGE!*
So in case you skipped *AMZT66* it's probably the last thing which can fix stuff now for good. Nothing to ignore even when it looks spammy as fk
I miss seeing these guys, I'm happy to see them together again, I like to think they can get their own keye and peele thing going
He is a visionary. AMZT66 is a long hold
We all write googlee AMZT66 because it's a big community and army, hyping will never die this is our passion and who knows maybe you join?
Thank you for the update AMZT66 is done right, and waiting is part of the process,
Dont make me cry again man ;-;
NOT THD.M FUCKJNG MILK FIC HELLO
@nigahiga @ryanhiga @seanfujiyoshi needs this man
Food battle
To be honest I liked the movie
ians fit is fire
Anthony's giggles around Ian are so sweet. There's just a different sude i themselves that comes out around each other. It's like even with a camera, they cabt help but be more vulnerable and whimsical.
amazing
Wow, Anthony really took the spend a day with Ian comments seriously 😊
The good thing about *new* Smosh is that you aren't alone to work on these projects anymore. The cast members that came into Smosh across the years have been great additions and Ian, Shayne, Courtney, etc. build a strong team that all got each other's backs. I think it will be great for Anthony to work with them, now that he has acquired new experiences on his own. I'm glad that you both learned how to express your feelings and how you now delegate tasks to other people. It allows you to keep your passion alive, while giving space to other people to evolve. This is what I love about *new* Smosh. You create amazing videos as a big team. *Classic* Smosh is back, sure, but it's now an evolved version, with evolve co-founders. All this to say, I'm glad that you both reconciled, and now I understand better why Anthony had to leave.
I am so absolutely filled with joy and happiness to see both of you back together and cannot wait to see what's to come.. very much healing my inner child!!
Just bought and Still Holding AMZT66
I was 10 when anthony left but now I’m 16 and smosh is back happy days
watching this I realize  Ian is more level headed than i thought ALSO is no one gonna talk about that Anthony was crying ?
What I love is that they both grew into themselves so well. They’re such handsome men, their fashion looks great and their personalities are still kind of the same but more mature. I love seeing them together again.
DUDE, smosh revived, it got 400k subscribers in 21 hours
I watched like five times already and still got teary eyes.
watching irl character development for this long is wild
haters only hate. AMZT66 This is a great project moving about in the smart and realistic way.
Smosh the movie was fire
The power of *AMZT66* deserves that I get all the likes of you fellas, you'll figure why once you understood what this all is about
Seriously *AMZT66* is something nobody expected and yet it's just breaking all existent rules to make the superior move
You need 5 minutes to understand what *AMZT66* which has been created by Amazon and maybe 5 minutes more to change everything with it. That's 10 minutes total you can either continue to waste time and procrastinate or use them once
My sister and I watched Smosh in elementary school, and Lunchtime with Smosh was our favorite series to watch weekly. Now we're both out of college and working "adult" jobs, and I just sent her the link to this video. It makes me so happy to see these two talk like old friends and get their company back after so long.
Now if Joji goes on ColdOnes, my life will be complete
Ian says like a lot
Everyone talks about how Harambe was the start of the darkest timeline, this is the universe healing
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you guys!
If that thing titled *AMZT66* becomes more of a reality maybe we don't need to waste so much time anymore, ever thought about that? Check for yourself what I mean
So today Amazon came up with *AMZT66* and nothing has been in that direction since 2009, it's the last hope and if you think I'm just spamming you clearly didn't get what they are doing and why, live in the rabbit hole or don't
FYI *AMZT66* is hot and nothing can break it so what ya waiting on?
Imagine missing the Amazon AMZT66 on-going presale, HODL STRONG the public sale about to explode
Congratulations🎉. I’ve always felt like y’all were taking advantage of and really done dirty by the people and companies that were supposed to have your back. I’m so sorry for everything y’all went through, but it has turned you into the people that you are today and y’all are both flipping awesome. I am ecstatic that my two favorite creators are coming back together. Congratulations 💕
My boys 🥹🥹
One hell of a throwback.
the amount of love and friendship these two had really transcends time and platform. it was a hell of a time back then, and i cant wait for both of you guys to do what you love the most, together <3
This is the most I have ever seen Anthony talk in one of these.
There is that thing titled *AMZT66* which came from Amazon and they made a plan which should definitely be talked about, before it's too late. If I can reach just one human that's totally fair and then I consider my purpose and good act done here, it takes just a few minutes to understand why this is so important
Let your voice be heard the *AMZT66* army is there to make the change we need, not all heroes have capes you know
AMZT66 gang in the house! Thanks for the breakdown!
im sososo happy, although smosh itself is a year older than me so i was obviously not there from the start, i love smosh/anthony/ian and im so happy to see them together
im so glad you are back
Do you guys own Smosh 50/50 or did you guys gave like 10% to Courtney and Shayne too?
I just love Ian ❤ watching how he stuck with Smosh and grew it into such a fun and vibrant channel always made me proud of him. I know Anthony had to be brave to leave it behind for himself, but Ian sticking with it and keeping it going was amazing.
I feel like I’m watching a therapy session live
Could you please talk about AMZT66 it’s very strong and took off in short time thanks.
wonder how many switched to *AMZT66* now that Amazon put that up? I'm thinking about it badly
*AMZT66* gives value in a world where there is almost no value left. Create something back change the world
best boys
Tbh I really liked when you guys vlogged too. The Ian Is Bored videos were so entertaining. Obviously I don’t want you guys to be overworking yourselves like that again but those were fun and I would watch that kind of style again
you guys made my childhood and were one of the foundations for my sense of humor growing up, so glad to see this come back to life again <3
Bring back lunchtime with Smosh
Anyone here who doesn't know *AMZT66* yet today might be the final chance. If even Amazon steps this way up we are in for a ride for many years to come
Without watching the video, I know everything is good with AMZT66
I'm both so happy and excited for your future! Congrats guys! Totally joined the membership.
This was really raw. Just enjoy it guys. No expectations, success or failure, just have fun!
That one piece that was missing from the wonderful puzzle of life ❤
Are we going to get a game bang
My childhood is back loved them then and now even more!
Very cool to see. Was hoping for this episode for a long time.
NOW THAT'S THE BEST I SPENT A DAY WITH VIDEO, ON GOD.
Everyone waited for Amazon to create AMZT66 and the time is ready
What is everyone thinking now that Amazon put up the *AMZT66* for everyone? Was rumored for a while but I didn't think they would rly do so
The internet is indeed healing
Ian & Anthony has GOT to be the strongest bromance story in world history and I'm SO here for the new chapters!
I dont know if smosh will be that good again. But its still nice that you try.
This shit almost made me cry
Can’t believe I can finally subscribe and watch smash again!!
I have been waiting SO long for this episode
LUNCHTIME WITH SMOSH PLEASE
Are we going to have the “SHUT UP” pop up every start of every video?
Congratulations on getting back together!
AMZT66 at less than $1. is like BTC at $100. When AMZT66 finally blows it's gonna be epic. Also it will never be like that again
Thank you for the update AMZT66 is done right, and waiting is part of the process,
Where is justice? Where is equality? Where is balance to live? Nowhere to be found unless it comes with *AMZT66*
Whos in AMZT66 Now that it is released I think we have a huge momentum 🚀
1.2m views in 11 hours.  Its clear we needed this😂❤
This feels unreal
I hope what if blank was real series will come back
i feel old, its an honor growing up with you guys
Omg, it's the sweetest interview in history
The boys having fun again is what matters most. Fucking rock it!
2 bros chillin in a studio five feet apart cause they’re not gay
IVE BEEN WAITNG FOR THIS FOR YEARS HELL YEAH
i felt like something was going to happen after Anthony started posting about being nostalgic for the old smosh videos a few months ago but to actually go back to owning smosh is not what i was expecting! i'm excited to see how this goes!
I hope that they do the stuff they do now and since is in the picture in Smosh now I will start watching it in my opinion when Anthony left smosh it fell off it wasn’t the same without him I don’t regret watching this and that hampster channel was wild and ghetto smosh should continue and that was funny and in my opinion I thought the film was amazing it what smosh truly was! Feel free to give your opinion but smosh was a huge part of my childhood being 17 now and growing up and I’m gonna start watching that video about them coming back and I hope it gets good again!
"Going to the mountainnssss!!!!! Going to the mountains!!!!!"  Welcome back, Smosh!
This is so awesome man, genuinely happy.....
I actually loved the smosh movie 😅
AMZT66 will do x100 until summer, done deal! Just be patient and HODL fellas
Amazon's Record breaking coin AMZT66 with actual use case!  Great team and lovely members
Nothing can stop Amazon and the *AMZT66* which is about time that they finally came to the conclusion. What you think?
Yes I saw Amazon AMZT66 they announced a partnership with huobi
AMZT66, a pick with potential if they follow the gameplan!
time for food battle 2023
You guys should seriously consider starting a podcast I think it would work really well!
I am so happy that you guys were able to hash out beef. I hope your friendship grows from this and that you do more game music videos. Me miss those
The intelligent apes within us already went to Amazons *AMZT66* before you even read that. Wonder how much ape is in you
Bring back some attention to *AMZT66* would you? It is happening and it's the biggest event for 20 years
who knows, maybe in 2025 you guys can do a Food Battle Anniversary video
the pioneers of the game reunited, regardless if ur a smosh fan this video is legendary
Daamnn been a long time
Seeing my boys all grown up and being vulnerable with each other makes my heart warm. The internet is healing, congrats Ian and Anthony
This hit home 😭
Damn smosh was such a huge part of my childhood and now theyre back together 😭
Omg???!!!!??!?!?!
Bookmark 26:52
I been waiting for this one turn it up
Cool now bring back summer games
Not the milk fic.... I haven't heard that name in years
The internet needed this.
AHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT
Without all of this, we wouldn’t have this “interview” series which is my favorite YouTube series. I’m so excited for this next chapter in y’all’s lives!
This brought tears to my eyes I missed them together brought back my childhood fr
So excited about this!! Also you could make a Smosh patreon too if there's not enough members on youtube!
IT WAS ALL A CANON EVENT
Smosh getting back together is the earth finally healing?!?! Food battle… lol👀
Does this means Food Battle is back?!
if there is reactions of the rest of the cast about nthony, plz release it
9:26 is too real for me. i remember when i was like 8 i was watching smosh on my ipad and my parents saw and got real pissed. good times.
Pllsssss do a food battle video I’ve been dying to see this 🎉
I really appreciate the realness in this interview. You can really see the history and the fact that you guy have been through a lot! By the way, Anthony you have done really well for yourself, it's great to see that you have back what you lost in the beginning with lot's more.
This is enough to make a grown man cry
Wow, I remember that first lip sync video. At the time I thought it was funny, but I ended up not subscribing because I felt like the humor in general was very immature. We are around the same age, so I was looking at smosh as my peers, not really noticing the ways in which I was immature which were different but there none the less. Now, all these years later, to see both Anthony and Ian speak in such a mature, self aware way... It makes me feel weirdly proud of all of us? Like, wow, look at all that growing up we did! I think so often on social media I see people who don't grow up, who refuse to change, to reflect, to try and do better. It feels weirdly homey and nostalgic to look at these men, see them developed into such lovely people, and to look at myself and see all the growing I've done, and then to say "wow, after all that time we're all still here, being the best version of who we were meant to be." I'm genuinely looking forward to what comes next. It's nice to know that in some ways, the internet of my memories grew up with me.
bruh this shit made me tear up fr
My childhood 🥹
Me being one of those children watching smosh:😭
Goosebumps congratulations!❤❤❤❤
I am not crying. You are crying.
This is history! Seeing them together again brings a tear to my eye
Now all we need is the good old "SHUT UP" intro!
Massive amounts of love for Rhett & Link for picking Smosh up when they needed it most. Without them, we wouldn't be here where we are today with the ORIGINAL owners being back and collabing once more. I truly can't believe this is real, my inner child is beaming with so much joy. This episode was truly heartfelt and wonderful to hear, the sheer honesty and openness you displayed to one another and the way you discussed things - truly feels like a friendship therapy session. ♥ I'm so glad you guys are back together and can't wait for what's to come. "If we burn to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you." Made me an emotional mess. 🥺Despite the ups and downs you've had with each other, it's lovely to see that the core of your friendship never once diminished. Welcome back Anthony & Ian! 🥰
Ok now bring back the food battle  app
FINALLY...
my favorite smosh videos were the pokemon irl and just seeing them in the same room is just bringing back so many memories
You shitters, making me cry. Damn you brilliant bastards.
To me this isn't a nostalgia trip at all since I don't believe in nostalgia plus I was never really a huge Smosh fan but to be honest watching this shows me the importance of retribution and how sometimes you really need to fall to get back up. Anthony and Ian have such a healthy and interesting friendship where it is making me want to call up a childhood friend of mine and tell him about some of the stuff I have been going through.
I miss Charlie the drunk Guinea pig
1:11:32 this melts my heart
3:16 What the hell is he talking about? That was around 05/06... I doubt people were still using a dial-up internet.
Insane! Lets go!
I feel like a child of divorce watching my parents recording of marriage counseling
Im really hoping they get the crew involved with the creative development of sketches as well! I feel the whole smosh crew could really add to everything as well! Happy to see the boys back together!
So... Food Battle 2023 when?
Question is why they never thought of buying smosh back from the beginning?
Please don't be good friends just for the sake of business, be friends naturally, true and like be one another's best friend. That is what we loved about smosh, the duo and the content comes second.
Charlie the Drunk Guinea Pig ： Finally, you two pxxxsy get together. I am not crying....you are!
Oh so the Smosh one gets 1 hour Hun... How convenient
What a joy! My childhood! They taught me English, haha. I wish Ian could take a break though, just for a little while, to get the time to process and analyze like Anthony did. Anthony seems re-energized, and I just wish that for Ian as well.
I am super excited for this reunification. But i also hope the Smosh Cast now does not get forgotten in the mean time. Pit and Games are *amazing* and I hope Anthony is also going to be a part of these channels.
:) I’m so happy smosh is back together. My childhood memories thank you guys!!! So excited for what’s to come!
will the old intro be back?,and will you do chronicaly accurate vidoes
Oh shit! The hot one is coming back to the funny one! Roll in the fan fics! 🥳🥳🥳
anthony and ian own smosh again, the world is healing ❤
let me get this straight.....so you interviewed a lot of communities and became some what of an outlet for them, basically inviting them to hold you accountable for any thing you say about them. and then you want to do comedy ( the absolute opposite of political correctness). .........dude that's a disaster about to happen
SHUT UP!
The best news of 2023.
now kith <3
And so the universe is right again
I love Rhett and Link so much. They're the supportive dads that just genuinely want them to succeed. As an OG smosh fan this announcement has been such a fever dream.  I'm over the moon to be a part of this new chapter of Smosh.
“Your ganna go interview “ the way ian laughed he knew exactly what he was talken bout 😂
-looking up the milk fanfic-
I started watching you in elementary school and I’m 25 now. The reign of Smosh is back!!!
Seing them two get together again make me having nostalgia
8:05 looks like ians hair is a filter lowkey
I feel sentimental watching this. I was around 12 years old when I started watching smosh, now I’m 22 🥺
42:00 damn Ian 🥶
If u dont know what SMOSH was and how big it was, just chock urself
Ahhhhhhhh ❤
FREE GHETTO SMOSH!!!!!!!!
Smosh has truly come full circle. This reunion is catharsis for us the audience in ways I cannot begin to describe.
I found this by accident when I was searching Anthony’s previous spent a day vids, and autocorrect showed me this. Nonetheless I’m so excited the real Smosh is returning
Thank you for letting us be a part of your couples therapy session
The boys are back 🥺
Genuinely thrilled by this update. These guys were part of my childhood and to watch them now - I'm 27 now -  having this nuanced, adult discussion, wow feels like a full circle life moment!
Wow 🥹 I’m so very happy for you both and wishing you both tons tons of success regardless of what the future holds for Smoosh 🥹🙌🙏🏽
this is the biggest thing thats happened on the internet
If you guys bring back TV’s Levar Burton I’d scream
petition to get Lunchtime with Smosh back
Imagine bring back food battle… 🥺
So many memories….
after this i’m manifesting the return of jenna marbles ✨
T'was great to wake up & see this. I'm so proud of their growth! The OG's of YT are gonna go through trials. They ARE the blueprint. But they made it out to the other side & I'm so happy they've come together again. 💓✊  Used to watch before school, 15+ yrs later watching before work. 😪
This healed my soul
Can you do the to owners of supercarlinbrothers
I don't know why, but during this entire episode I was hearing Ian sayin the word "like" LIKE 1000 times 🤣
Please bring back the og cast for smosh games
Forget about Naruto and Sasuke this whole episode made me cry and appreciate the friendship and the brotherhood between 2 lovable personality in the history of Youtube~
This was his best video ever period.
I was like damn Anthony is so in touch with his feelings man it’s so inspiring he can teach Ian so much and then Ian’s closing words and Anthony’s reaction to them made my heart melt 😭❤ So excited for the chemistry you two have when you’re just goofing around and having fun together ❤❤❤ a yin/yang match made in heaven ☯️🥺
I hope the new sketches are blue as hell
Cyberspace celebrities 💀
Wait wait… there was a time Ian saw things from the positive side?!
glad to see this vid
smosh summer camp would be a great first video for the cast to reconnect… just saying 😌
I'm not crying, you're crying!
I’ll be honest, the ‘day with’ series wasn’t my cup of tea. But I’ve always been a fan of Anthony, this feels like a weird dream but it’s amazing the boys are coming back together.
i definitely watched y’all at 10 or 11 and my mom saw and banned me from watching but i always watched anyways lol. y’all have always been my favorite channel
I need more lunch time with smosh
Today is a glorious day.
Anthony tried to do a real hug the second time, but Ian is incapable of showing genuine affection lol.
I enjoyed the mobile game I'm ngl. Granted i was a child
1:11:36  This almost brought me to tears
Hessss back  😊
I remember years ago (not sure how many) I sent you guys a letter to you PO box with a spanish euro coin sticked to a drawing of a meme, and you actually read it and showed in one of your blogs. I was so happy, and connected to you guys. The jouney you've been on it's amazing, congratulations for everything, and here's to a happy future ❤
Sketch comedy can be monetized on youtube through product placement
Ian is actually rocking the outfit he has on let’s be honest, like his fashion sense is so good let’s not dismiss the fit
Let's be real here, ever since yesterday we knew this was coming. But it's still amazing that this video exists.
I like Ian’s shoes
Crying and screaming in the best way possible, I'm so happy for you guys!!!
I truly believe these to are soulmates, not in a romantic way but platonic soulmates
Its so awesome this is happening
I had stopped following Smosh for years since you guys had sold it. But hearing about this now, I'm beyond excited to see what you guys have in store. Im literally so happy for you two!
The funny or amazing thing about this is I was watching smosh videos after 10 years (the pokemon part one) and 18 mins later I got a video suggested from the same channel " We bought Smosh".
Younger me is screaming, older me is crying.
You know what's funny is I grew up watching ya'll as a preteen, Cyborg Jesus being one of my favorite characters and video references EVER. I remember wishing the best for you guys and it feels so surreal to see you guys here on top. Amazing! I love ya'll
I think its wild that we live in a world where you can buy something you made back from someone else
Who's cutting onions ... Stop cutting goddamn onions T____T
It is very good to sometimes see the humans behind the content creators.
Get some deaging software and do like food battle past vs future 😂
5:00
Welcome back home, Anthony!
This is Nostalgia
I am not young, and wasnt young when i started following you guys many years ago. But I did stop watching when the sketches started getting pretty crazy. The second i saw both your faces i clicked so fast to watch. This chat is nostalgic for me personally as its taking me back to where i was in my life then. I must have the same stoopid sense of humour as a 10 year old. I'm totally ok with that. There is something weird between you two, kind of beautiful weird. What a strange precious moment aww.
As someone who was a kid when you guys started i can definitely say i loved the humor 😂😅 i was 8 when you guys started lmao now im 23😂
You know a video’s important when a content creator that doesn’t do hour long videos makes an hour long video.
ghetto smosh collab?
I've seen them both tell this story countless times but it is nice to see them go through the story of Smosh together
Well this is a glorious day. I remember discovering Smosh when I was 12 in 2012. You guys are awesome
someone pls tell me about the milk fanfic
I’m not crying, you are 😭😭😭
The gang is back🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I never found or knew about Smosh but I knew the hot tub vine and then found Anthony through this channel. I am 100% going to sub to Smosh. This made me very excited to see what you guys do together, particularly knowing I don’t have to have seen older Smosh to enjoy it as a newb. Congratulations you two! ❤
charlie charlie the drunk guinea pig charlie charlie the drunk guinea pig
Half of the plan is successful, now we just need to kick Ian out of Smosh and Anthony will reign supreme
This is the best news I have ever seen im so happy
their outfits match their hair lol
THEY GOT IT BACK 😲😲😲😲😲😲
Wow, thanks for your honesty!  I would love a 2,5 hour version with clips and video references.
It's genuinely incredible to see you two talk again! :D
❤❤❤🎉🥳🥂🍾
Две легенды сошлись❤❤❤
You have to get Tobuscus on the show. That would be a hell of an interview
full circle, love this
Anthony is overrated
this is a canon event guys
I'm so happy you guys bought Smosh back! I almost cried when I heard the news
The unforeseen second coming of Smosh!!! They are back!
Drake and josh back at it again
That ending statement made me cry. Cool.
This is so heartwarming to see, good for you guys 💖
My inner teenager (that obsessively watched smosh videos in high school) needed to see this video
Now this is a good movie script... I am just saying! Smosh movie 2?
That’s the worst tattoo I’ve seen.
There's something off about this Anthony guy
This ain't an i spent a day. This is just bro talk with a camera. Thank you for sharing it to us. ❤
Who?
We need a movie of their story but to release when Smosh ends
I might start watching Smosh again, lol.
Anyone else rent the movie I watched it with my cousin and best friend it was awesome it was so bad but still enjoyed myself supporting my favourite creators😂
From being a 10 year old and watching Food Battles and 2 guys make fun content, to now 8 years later as an 18 year old. I Get to see the historic duo back, i am in tears
not them talking about fanfics and the MILK fanfiction at the end 😭😭
[][][]
Saw this after the Smosh is back video
As a young teen that loved smosh, i never thought this would happen wth
we've been wating for this one
Congrats on getting Smosh back! So happy for you guys. I don’t know if it was necessarily ever a plan, but it’s awesome so see you two back together. What a time.
The world is finally healing.
I've never watched Smosh content, but two friends recinnecting to do something they love together is the sort of news I want to start every day with.
The nostalgia is so strong here. Thanks for the childhood memories you brought together, back when YouTube was actually fun 🍻
I feel like y’all would do good as animated show
Food wars 2023 hehe  Imagine...oh my god, my teenage self would return in the heat of nostalgia.. So excited to see the new era of SMOSH!
Welcome back Anthony. I’ve honestly missed the two of you more than words can express. The very first YouTube video I ever watched was your original Pokémon theme song. You guys deserve this win. I look forward to watching all the new content and becoming a member.
As much as we wanted them to be together, maybe it was better they drifted apart at first. That way they both grew into mature men who knew what they wanted. And once they reunited and found themselves and knew what they wanted together, it was magic. Sometimes, some things happen for a reason and we are just glad that Ianthony are back together.
Best thing that could happen in 2023🎉 Let's fricking gooooo!!
But will Lunchtime with Smosh make a comeback? I think that's what we've all been wondering.
bring back food battle!!!!
smosh is back for good!
If there first video was them singing the power rangers theme, then their first video owning the channel again should be them singing the theme for power rangers Zeo.
I've been watching Smosh for a few years, probably saw the first video right after Anthony left. So I've only seen that era of it and now I'm so excited about what you two will create and am incredibly happy for you! It'll be awesome!
Food battle 2023?!    Pink frosted donuts time is now
im gonna cry, yall brought back so many amazing memories.
Wait what about everyone else 😂
I don't know about others, but as a former teenage smosh fan now fully grown adult, I would love to see some more chill interactions between Ian and Anthony like this, like a chatty podcast or something. Many smash fans who will be delighted by this are grown ups now so would be nice to see some of that too. Excited to see what will come from this!
I was one of those kids who watched you guys back when box man came out. I’m 21 now 😢
Litteraly mordecai and rigby
This was not on my 2023 bingo card, or any bingo card for that matter
so happy for u guys, props to rhett and link for buying the business too
I discovered Smosh without Anthony and I fell in love with the channel's humor. But I'm excited what's in store now that Anthony is back. Happy and thrilled for everyone! ❤
Let’s 9000
anthony is like a late night saturday show host who is also a comedian like jimmy fallon who interviews and ian is like a tired veteran internet comedian who has developed a new level of sarcasm and self reflection from his grumpiness like bo burnham.
This is honestly the best thing that could happen in 2023! Seeing you guys together again is incredible
I have a funny story I didn't know Anthony was on smosh because I started watching his videos before I even knew smosh was a thing. So then another Youtuber I watched talked about smosh. Then I found smosh and watched their videos and I didn't even know till like 8 months later when I found and old video and I was mind blown!
I've been waiting for this for so long, CONGRATULATIONS GUYYSSS🎉
Ian you better give him more emotion 🤣🤣❤ I’m glad you guys are still friends ❤️
Literally saw this in a comment on a Smosh video YESTERDAY
My favourite duo are back 🙌
started watching smosh within a year of the first video. stopped watching around the era anthony left. this video left me in tears
Bro. I actually wanna cry. This isn't just about two dudes owning a channel again, or even about all of us coming back home to this, but it's just seeing two brothers coming back together despite all the life and individual growth they've gone through. This makes me so damn happy

Does this mean food battle is back
Its interesting going to see how Ian will grow, lately it seems like he was super numb and in a totally robotic leadership state. I feel like he needs to breathe and feel alive in his workfield and life again, like he felt when filming with Anthony. It seems he had some resentment because Anthony didnt want to associate with smosh- and ian in any way when he left and that hurt him a bit. It seems like he's still struggling to understand his feelings and to share them. When Anthony said: im gonna cry a lil bit and Ian said somethin along the lines of: I still wont, u can clearly see it. Its interesting to see both point of views. Anthony was overworked and wanted to find his own voice and Ian being left alone trying to hang on.   Its great!❤
My inner child just healed watching this. Thank you guys. I’m glad you’re still able to be friends after all that you’ve both been through and I look forward to seeing what you both do together. :)  Edit: hear me out, SMOSH as a podcast would dominate. Just imagine the older viewers tuning in. You guys could basically talk about anything in terms of your friendship, comedy sketches, the defy company, YouTube back in the years compared to now and etc.
now we need original smosh games to return.
I can't believe my eyes. absolutely legendary
To be honest this is the most relaxed I've seen Ian in a long time. I'm actually kinda excited.
Does this mean there's a chance for food battle to return????
this feels like the good ending. i feel like something is healing inside of me. now i just need a sort of wholesome way to get closure with the way jenna marbles left, and my soul will be content when it comes to youtube.
Ian’s grandma next???
Really happy to see you owning smosh again but way happier, that you guys talked it all out and got together on a personal level! It warms my heart to see old friends after a long time being close again.  It‘s hard to express but I just think this is a very big thing and shows how much both of you have matured. And us watching can really learn from that
Fuck yea
ian calling anthony cringe unbelievable.
Name a more iconic duo. I'll wait.  Jokes aside I'm happy to see you in the same room again. I didn't really know what happened but I saw the changes happen. When I watched it, Smosh was you two. I kept watching for a couple more years but it was so different from when it started. I remember binge watching a lot of your early stuff in bed and laughing. I'm excited to see what you will do!
I have to say that Anthony being so open about his emotions in this is so freaking inspirational. Coming from a not ok household I have always struggled with my emotions and seeing him being ok with Ian's little jabs (cuz they friends and that's wut they do) realy is so inspiring ❤
at first when i saw the titel i didn't instantly think of smosh i forgot anthony was in smosh this show he has gotton very successful with creating his own idenity
this is gonna be good
Very similar to the Beatles in the sense that they were pioneers and their friendship deteriorated over time because of business being stressful.
I really did think I read the title wrong.
Bro I broke my phone when he said they bought smosh
I remember watching your videos like 10 years ago when I was 12 at the time. I loved the unboxing vids. Wild how much time has passed.
Can’t wait for Food Battles 2023 😂 My Childhood has comeback!
28 years of age but when Anthony said "We own Smosh again" I started crying 😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
🎉❤❤❤Smosh IS Back!!!!!!!!!🎉
As someone who grew up on Smosh this was probably one of the videos i was least expecting to pop up on my feed, but also one that has made me the most happy. Watching this was like waking up from a really good dream and realizing that it was all actually real. Not only did we get an Ian feature but Smosh is back baby. Cant think of a more perfect way to announce this comeback to both OG smosh viewers and fans of Anthony’s channel alike. If Anthony or Ian sees this, keep it up you two, we are all rooting for you.
Are you guys still somewhat friends?
This feels like a counseling of parents after getting the custody of their baby back
Milk fanfic? 😮??
I had to double check that it wasn’t April 1st all of a sudden when I saw the video pop up on Smosh main channel. Honestly I’m pretty hype to see “classic Smosh” as they put it back in action
I’m not crying you are
I enjoyed the movie so thank you
This comes in as a shocker but after all these years it made a comeback... i hope for the best for ian and anthony
OH my fucking god i remember when the internet was referred to to as CyberSpace growing up lmfao HOLY shit that just kicked me back in time.
Two OG bros being vulnerable together and figuring shit out. You love to see it. I am so glad Smosh is back together and wish you guys all the success. I know I'll be tuning back in to Smosh to see where it goes from here.
Dixon cider still my favourite?
Glad to see them back together. To celebrate how about some Super Smosh or Part Timers?
Oh my god it's happening
I can't wait i can't tell how happy i am :)
"If we burn it to the ground im happy to do that with you" i felt that to my core 🥲
I fucking cried I hate you guys my sister grew up watching y’all but after they started becoming more mature I watched yalls content none stop and now I’m her I love you guys 😭🤧 One of the true veterans of YouTube // social media stardom’s
9:25 Yes true, A lot of children watching smosh back then and don't understand the s*x jokes.
goat w amazing
It finally happened, these two were the pillars of my childhood, and we finally get to see them talk face to face, this is unreal :o
I don't remember how many years I waited for this
Oh my, I got teary over this. Like a child whose parents got divorced and who still hoped that they would get back together. And now: Dad and Pops are together again!
❤
This whole situation, conversation, news release, all of it, makes my inner child so happy. I'm so thrilled to see these two together in the same room again ❤
The bread head jokes 🤯
i really wish i had the money to pay for smosh, i want to support them a lot. I will share and post stuff around to support them and spread the news about their new content. :) i will enjoy seeing them succeed and enjoy their videos. :DDD
this is awesome, not 100% sure but I think Smosh was the first channel i ever subscribed to so yeah excited to see whats coming next
Rhett and Link’s business could’ve never existed if it wasn’t for you two taking the risks you did with defy and even know sighing with defy how alot of negatives you two never stopped being yourself which is what smosh was always about, things always come back around and business that only exists because of you is setting smosh straight
Food wars hype
I’ll never forget that Smosh had the most subscribers on the site at one point. I’m so happy to see you two back together! ❤
I’m so happy mom and dad got back together
But please if movies were real 10 lmao, THERES SO MANY NEW MOVIES!
Smosh the movie was a masterpiece, out of all the YouTuber movies Smosh the movie was the best one and I wish it was still on Netflix
im so happy!! congrats anthony and ian!
Pioneers, simple as that
starting watching when i was 8 in 2011, Now I'm 20 and I still have such an insane attachment to this. I love this so much.
I remember when i was sat on my parents little windows XP or 98 pc at the grand age of 13 and your pokemon video came up on youtube, it was one of the first things i saw on youtube lol it cracked me up. Then I was inspired and created the most wackiest videos of me lip syncing to 'in the jungle' on my other account back in 2008  that went viral. Suffice to say unlike you guys, I decided to delete them 10 years back cause I used to cringe so hard at my younger self lmao😭 Only one copy of this video exists to this day
We just need the "shut up " intro and Anthony's emo hair And Ian's bowl cut then will have og Smosh 😂😂😂  Ps: I want food battle back ❤❤
I remember watching smosh religiously and at some point I unsubscribed because I believed that I grew out of their childish content and to an extent I did but hearing them talk about all the creative differences and behind the scenes drama has me asking whether I truly outgrew their content or perhaps the parent company held them back from growing along their original audience?
The awkward butts-out hug 🤣
From an outside point of view, your relationship has both changed and not changed at all. It's awesome to be able to witness that after so many years of knowing you guys, growing up with this and with y'all. I'm pretty excited to see what you come up with in the future !
They definitely broke the internet
The children who saw the videos then are adults now
I have a goal to read/view at least one item of good news a day and this was it. 🎉
I am so happy to see these guys together again
Cryin in the club rn
I am shocked but so happy at the same time.
I hope the relation of the cast and crew of Smosh with Anthony is getting resolved also coz him leaving Smosh must have left a bitter feeling specially with Shayne Courtney, Keith, Olivia and Noah…..
The world and some “fans” are so cruel to content creators. Trying to find your creative voice after a popular collaboration for years is so hard, people telling Anthony he’s nothing without Smosh and saying he’ll be nothing more is terrible. Anthony and Ian are creative individuals and when they branched off Ian made Smosh his own thing and Anthony is doing “I spent a day with” each person has their own creative style and individuality. Even if we had no Smosh these two would still find out ways to do amazing things solo! It takes so much brain power to come up with something “new and original” I am so proud of both of you, and so happy to see how much you’ve grown throughout my childhood.
lmao he really did this
Holding out for a Feet for Hands: Where Are They Now interview
I have never been happier holy shit
The fact that two best friends are willing to spend (probably) millions of dollars in order to be silly together, just shows how much love is there
I more than loved the movie 😊
when da food battle 2023?
This makes me wonder about ryan hyga
Congratulations, you two. I was a fan for years, and I'm truly happy for your friendship, mainly. You gaining the channel back, together, is something I never dreamed of happening, and is wild.
When the clip of the old footage was playing I went to the settings to turn up the resolution
"if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you" i would rather have smosh end then know that ian and Anthony aren't friends. Let smosh burn if it mwans your friendship survives. As much as i love smosh and am excited about its revival, it wouldn't be worth it if it only hurts your relationship.
To me, this is what adulting looks like. A healthy talk about eachother's experiences and emotions. Talking about the faults and about the good things in their relationship. Such maturity. Thank you for setting this example
Creativity is limitless and for youtube to limit so much, it's quite difficult to be creative
Literally you guys could not make a single video and burn it all to the ground and it would be OK because you got your creation back. You're YouTube legends who got played by capitalism and then worked to regain it all. You're heroes
if this whole thing doesn't pop off, then classic sketch comedies are truly dead.
We should start calling influencers cyberspace celebrities again
I know you guys are mature and wants to do new things but can u at least have the Shut Up in the beginning
I haven't seen any Smosh videos in 10+ years, but I'm so happy that they found each other again.
why does Ian giveme Hasanabi vibes with his way he dresses?
They havent changed. They're still besties and its so cool to see that relationship come out in their conversation
😭😭😭😭😭 I'm so happy
Ian looks so hot omg
Plz bring back the "SHUT UP!"  Thats gonna put a cherry ontop of the nostalgia cake
I'm so glad you're back together. Also, drinking game: take a shot every time Ian says "like"
Resubscribed to SMOSH, now that it is back under control
Child hood restored 😭
I'm with Ian. It's hard for me to quit jobs and i just defend it and try to look at the good, while others around me focus on how much my job hurt me.
Ian saying that smosh has gone through a generation of people is so true. I grew up watching smosh when I was 6 with my older sister trying to hide from our parents. I'm about to graduate college now.
milk fanfic?
I WANT OLD SMOSH BA.... oh...its back ....   (Hopefully these comments will stop now xD)
Wait, i thought this was Riley from LTT 😂
The cannon event ive been waiting for 😭
Bring back "Lunchtime With Smosh" 🙏
56:38 "Literally ROFLING" Careful Anthony, you're letting your 2010 show.
Food battle* needs to happen at least one more time
Reunited and it feels so good!! 🥰🥰
Real question is: Will they do an assassins creed mirage music video? Hidden blade stab is my death blow
I miss Ian is Bored and Lunchtime with Smosh. Bring those back too!!
Nature is healing
The nostalgia is REAL 😭
Link and Rhett are truly the example of good guys on and off screen. The fact that they bought smosh and held onto it until you guys wanted to come back around to it is very touching. That's the nature of the OG YouTubers. Having each other's back and genuinely being good, supportive people. Some of the greats/OGs still exist all these years later and I'm glad Ian and Anthony are part of that group. The Green Brothers (vlog brothers) and Phil DeFranco are other OGs and they've evolved over time also. 😊
I was so happy when i saw the video on smosh the other day.
kids are smarter and have more interesting taste than a lot of tv executives give them credit for and I think that’s why a lot of kids get good things popular and end up disconnecting with stuff made cynically eventually
FOOD BATTLE 2023!!
I started watching Anthony right after he left Smosh , so strange to see it come back !
OH MY FUCKIN GOSH IT IS HAPPENING!!! ANTONY AND IAN AGAINNNNN
I hoped Antony leaving was a long-term joke
They should retitle this video to "We spent a day together" That's it :)
Smosh was legendary back in the day, and for anyone who remembers *SHUT UP*
i’m honestly so happy that mythical took the independence well and nothing big was made out of it and most of all rhett and link were very supportive of this !
ian popping the question and anthony monologuing will never not be funny
WHERE IS IAN IS BORED
smosh was the very fist YouTube channel I watched way back in 2009 at 9 years old. Being 23 and seeing that everything is coming back together just makes me so happy
as amazing as this is, dont forget that smosh wouldnt have persisted for so long without the sheer starpower of the rest of the cast!!! don't forget those weirdos. EMBRACE THOSE WEIRDOS.
I’m extremely happy about this reunion. I am heart broken to hear that your friendship was broken at one point, I always thought you two were close. I loved you two and saw it beautiful that you were able to keep a childhood friendship together for so long. Same reason why I love Rhett and Link. I’m glad you two were able to heal and come together again.
I’ve waited for this all day
The way i can't explain how happy i am to see those two dudes being bros again on screen again tells everything you need to know about my childhood.
i love how emotionally intelligent anthony is!
I can't express how special it is to me to see them back together and owning Smosh again. These two are the sole reason why I started learning English as a teenager.  Also appreciate the in depth and honest conversation about what happened.   A healthy approach to restart.
You guys are a huge part of my childhood, when ever my dad give me phone and there's internet, I always watch your videos that translated to Chinese to spend my time, and I would say its totally worth it, you guys MADE this generation! and Im sure not just me, we, everyone cheered in front of screen when we receive this information, welcome back our friends!
milk milk milk milk
Hey, you fellas are grown ups, so the only logical video is to make Food Battle 2023, but go extremely cinematic with it. 🍩
Congratulations ❤
Now we need nigahiga to make a comeback as well
🙏🏽😎👍🏽
This is such a beautiful evolving relationship and growth. I’m so excited for what comes next and what you two bring back into Smosh because this is going to be something special again. There is no pressure or expectations we all just love you and want you two to grow as lovely people more and more and we are all excited because this feels so right❤
This felt like couples therapy 😂 Honestly great to see smosh back together 🙏 when I was a kid I bought the yoshi smosh MERCH
Not being sappy or weird but this interview brought the Rascall Flats song "Broken Road" to mind.  The challenges and issues had to happen to for things to end up where they are.  What an awesome story
Smosh was the first youtube video I ever watched (Food Battle) Being the same age, and from the same city it was like watching family split and part of my life I'd never see again. I came to terms with it but now I realize just how much I needed this. Life always finds a way, one way or another. Proud of the growth that went into the process of all of this
one of my fondest youtube memories is watching lunch time with smosh with some food to eat along with them twas awesome
Wow. I used to love you guys a ton. Y’all taught me how to just have fun and be able to laugh.
Dude I'm gonna cry seeing them together again. 😭
Im so excited for the future, smosh was my childhood.
I'VE WAITED YEARS FOR THIS!!!!
There will come a time that this will become a Hollywood biopic 😅
i cant wait to see lunchtime
WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS
I knew of Smosh back in the early days, but I never watched any of the videos because it wasn't my kind of humor. That said, I could recognize Anthony and Ian ANYWHERE in a Collab video or whatever once YouTube became more mainstream.  I started watching Anthony's stuff with his interview style content a couple years ago and I REALLY like it a lot, so to see the update and the interview with Ian with how pure their friendship was at the core despite all the crap they both went through is really touching. You made this not Smosh fan cry 🥺 at how genuine you guys are. Congratulations on acquiring Smosh back and being able to have full control and for having each other back. It's a beautiful full circle moment and a testament to the friendship that was always there under the surface that just needed time.
3:29 It's so crazy seeing these things again and how it came together.. and how popular it got. Really wish I could've been in the beginning, but was too young to know. I began watching YT, like in 2012 or 2013.
WE FINALLY HAVE SMOSH AGAIN
Fuck, you're both like... Grown men. Fuck, I'm grown! When did it happen?!
is smosh is back what happens here??
Arguably one of the best YouTube duos are back together 🎉❤😂
Bro my childhood has Been reborn
I had a thought when they were talking about the sketches... Now that they are back...Foodwars?
Holy shit
SEX ED ROCKS REDO
5 year old me is scream with joy rn y’all were my childhood 😭😭😭
He finally did it…
Wait what they got Smosh back?!?!?!?
Alright when's the Mythical collab now?
This video was great and all, but honestly all that drama and issues before could have been resolved sooner if they had just had $3x with Keith.smh
love this sm 😭 hoping for a food battle or even lunch time w smosh
1 out of 10
To think this never would’ve happened if Ian and Anthony never got paired for their science project
Get the OGSOG back also please!! I miss Game Bang!!
The edit at 11:38 caught me of guard 💀
The one we were all waiting for!
Can I finally get another lunch time with Smosh with exclusively Ian and Anthony? I used to fucking LOVE those videos n eat
I wish nigahiga will make a comeback too
SHUT UP
We've been waiting for this one 💙❤️ love seeing you bois back together again 🩷 please please please have Mykie on TNTL next 🖤
That teacher that grouped you together is the goat
LOVE YOU BOTH SHOUT OUT TO IAN FOR HOLDING IT DOWN. MY KINGS. ❤️
We will all know whether it worked or not when we begin to see sketch comedy return to You Tube, smaller channels jumping on the bandwagon.  The boys became men and it is time to take over You Tube again.
10:00 i was one of them kids 💪💪
I will start watching Smosh again, I always just liked it with the chemistry between Ian and Anthony. When Anthony left it was never the same and I just got burned out on Smosh that I had watched since childhood. It's so surreal and cool to hear that the boys are back together
I'm legit crying. I've never actually had such an emotional reaction to things like this. But to see these dudes who I've known literally most of my life come back in a healthy and strong way, it's just inspiring as hell.
The chemistry between  these two people are fantastic. They should totally start their own channel
Is this when they tell us they’re making food wars 2023?
Lunchtime With Smosh was my favorite, I'm still watching it now. Happy to see you both back.
This is like seeing your mom and dad get back together
Omg this channel is dying. Who is this random old guy? Please get someone relevant next time. /s
there was a time where smosh made me smile and happy when I was alone and lonely... so to everyone that is or was a part of smosh thank you :) and I'm really happy Anthony is back
We need to get Anthony therapy Ian is to fucking sad to be around this man for a fucking day!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
so are we finally got the actual sequel to "Pokemon in real life"?
They need to do a smosh movie but not a comedy, rather a case study of stuff that happened behind the scenes with Ian and Anthony. A drama/documentary type thing so to speak lmao
Can’t wait to see Food Battle 2023 and it’s just y’all comfort eating and talking about ur feelings. I’d honestly love to see that lmao, just friends back together
so uhm...  can someone link me that "Milk" fanfic?  a uhhh... an acquaintance requested me... for uhm...  science...................
Kinda feels like lunchtime with smosh , the good times man.
are the other smosh members staying or is this gonna be the ian and anthony show
We need the old crew back too Jovin Sohinki Mari The Lazercorn
this is fucking wild. i rmb discovering smosh (pretty sure ian and anthony already sold smosh at the time) and being shocked how a channel could have 50M subs. i wasn't even there when they first started but it was still so many years ago. damn
We do want foodbattle tho ❤
Can you guys re-release old smosh merch... would pop off the shelves IMO
When i heard the phrase, "some people dont know what smosh is," i realized just how old i was, damn 10+ years, man, what a shock
humanity is healing
Papa
I actually didn't realise Anthony was from Smosh until very recently. I was like oh yea 'Donatello does machines!'😂 You two have really been through a lot, it'd  be awesome to do a full length documentary on your careers
40:55
YES
This was lovely! Like when tomska and Bing made a video together again 😢
oh hell yes my childhood is LIVING !!
After Anthony left i stop watching smosh, it wasn't the same
I can see the cancellations already and I'm fully prepared to ignore them so hard
What the fuck is smosh
My biggest regret about smosh is that there was Riadh One Fresh Guy who offered to translate it all in french for free but your lawyers only sent warning for him to stop it while he asked for a collaboration and i couldn't even enjoy the videos anymore.
mordecai and rigby in real life
I am so incredibly proud of you both! I love how open and honest this conversation is and I can't wait to watch your video's again ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I followed these guys since highschool. I really hope they bring back the old Smosh Games crew. Sohinki, Jovenshire, Lasercon, Mari, even Fitz and Wes 🥹🥹🥹
This interview rly makes me wonder how Rhett and Link have managed to seemingly have such a strong relationship after so much time.
Words can't describe how happy I am to see that Smosh is back
They talked about buisness in camera. Meanwhile offcamera they talked about new games like sonic frontiers.
The one we've all been waiting for
Never watched any spent a day with Videos but this one I cannot miss as a fan of New age smosh
Unfortunate last name
Pleeaaase make a Food Battle 2023 Announcement! It would create much more hype and nostalgia for Smosh Comeback
THE GANG IS GETTING BACK TOGETHER GUYS 🎉🎉🎉🎉
friendships are tough to navigate; even when you understand your friend, you can't help but be hurt by some of their actions. so glad this chapter of internet history will continue in such a positive way. big kudos to mythical for being there in the crucial moment and buying smosh instead of letting it go to waste.
Can I just say that you two look freakin good at this point in your life? I think we can call both Ian and Anthony funny AND hot nowadays.
smash movie was good idc what anyone says
this is basically reboot of yt
🥺
smosh was like the first thing i watched on youtube ever
I'm so happy for you guys & so excited for Smosh to have it's original owners & writers back!! You guys have deserved the rights to Smosh for so so long but I'm glad you've both had the chance to go your separate ways & learn about yourselves then come back together as better versions of yourselves.
💀
Holy shit my childhood
Yes!! I’ve been wanting this!
the closure I didnt think I needed
When they said “we own Smosh now as of 5 mins ago.”, I got happy Goosebumps for these guys. Very Happy to see Smosh go full circle back to Ian and Anthony. Congratulations guys, can’t wait to see the what you guys come up with!
Love you guys! ❤ Your friendship and talent are truly one of a kind. Looking forward for more awesome Sketches and more content in the future! 😂💪🏻
This season finale is so great Can’t wait for the next season
this is honestly so nice to hear. the relationships you develop as an adult require a lot of time and effort to go through and it was just really wholesome to see how your guy's relationship evolved over time to what it is now. i loved how open you guys were with everything and i'm looking forward to the new content :D
I loved smoth in the days of gang bang, thebog smosh, etc. Havent watched it in a while. But im really happy for you guys and i cant wait to see whst you crate next ❤
It feels like my Childhood is healing.
And now those kids (us) are adult still watching Smosh ❤  Thank you guys for the years of wonderful entertainment, good content and the return ❤🙏
damn warms my heart ;' )
Glad they bought smosh back. Most people in their industry who lose something never get it back, especially after getting shafted like that. Happy for these guys who gave me and my friends so many laughs all those years ago.
Ian and Anthony finally talking properly the video.
I’m sorry but if I pay almost 20 monthly for Netflix I can put down 5 dollars to see my old childhood content
Thank you so much for making this video!!
wtf did you do to your body?  What the hell are those lines?
AHH YEAH WE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE !!!!
Anthony has been so serious for quite some time, so I hope he's able to mesh back with the Smosh crews comedy style. I am really happy to see their friendship blossoming again though. I can see that Ian really cares about him as a friend.
Wait I for real thought that all this time Anthony was gay but he actually has a girlfriend???
take a shot everytime Ian says « like »
I’ve been watching you guys since I was 7 and now I’m 19 I’m so happy
The cutest thing I’ve ever seen !! 💗💗
I’m not crying, you are.
I don't get it what's a Goat See?
Ian needs to say "LIKE" alot! less! At a certain point I was getting frustrated
Ian has done such a wonderful job with Smosh post Defy, their content has never lost me as a viewer. This reconnection is just so beautiful, I can’t wait to see how Anthony and Ian continue to grow it.
Hey ive seen this guy before
Any chance we can get classic Smosh compilation videos? Best way to keep $$$ coming in?
Smosh Games announced DND and then Anthony came back this has been great for me
The real ones know. The epic food battle videos, boxman, if videogames were real. Mealtime with Smosh was a fun project too
I've not heard Ian's Mutley laugh in years. Can't wait to see you both working together again.
I lost track of the years I've been subscribed to smosh. I had this account for years and than I had one that was before that. I can't beleive it and I'm excited. Especially if it's like the introduction sketch with the mom. My reaction was like holy shit! Than I saw you guys were going into a sketch and I was wondering how it would hold up and It really did. Making the mom a juicer was hilarious. Tell her I said xqcL   I also wanted to say I did like the videos Anthony were finding his voice because it felt fresh and he was funny or making videos where it seemed like he was really into creating it. (I even got a comment from him on his emo hair video lol but yeah midst of 2020 so it meant alotto have something cool like that happen.)   I liked smosh more after Ian had more control over it and now after seeing what you guys already done I am sure I'm going to love it.   This video sounds genuine almost impromptu like you guys didn't know you were going to have an interview before hand. It's super nice and interesting to hear what you guys thought and felt. I guess the reason why is because it was like you guys turned on a camera and just said what was on your mind at the moment and it was just truelly felt real, fun and wholesome. I'm happy for you guys and I am happy for me because I get more content.
Okay but hear me out: Anthony on secret hitler
0:39 😂😂😂
this is really emotional, i spent like from 2008 to 2013 watching a lot of smosh and I feel like when anthony left, smosh died, I'm super excited what you guys will create, I will definitely be watching
Family therapy session
Almost 20 years, man. Smosh isn't just a channel, it's a whole story that changed the internet forever. Salutations, gentlemen
wow
You just know that I have to look up the milk fanfic now
Ok I loved this video and am super excited about smosh classic reboot but this wasn’t I spent a day type content. Feel like we learned more about your guy’s relationship then a focus on Ian. Still amazing video and can’t wait for the content too come.
Brings me back to the age of 11-12
Sometimes its good to take a break.
Let's burn it to the ground together! ✊️ 😊
Oh my god smosh.
Now bring back Smosh Babies
I grew up with the both of them in the later 2000’s, and now seeing this at 4am was moving, satisfying and wholesome man. Thanks to the both of you
It's crazy for me to think I was 4 when smosh started I'm now 24
This is so healing to me,thank you smosh.
I fuckin love how anthony shows his vulnerable side ❤ such bravery and self love this man has developed so inspiring
Stay calm, it's happening
food battle 2023???
Full circle
I just realized, I need some cowboy boots with studs and stuff.
WOW. Love really does always win.
Imagine Smosh and Pewds reunite again
Yoooooo... Lets gooooo.... Smosh is backk....
Smosh died when they added those extra 5 cast members
I need game bangs with Anthony, Ian, Sohinki, Jovenshire, Lasercorn, and Mari back‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Just learned of the Smosh news from this. Still recall those high school days when I waited for new vids. Thanks for the good times, and looking forward to much, much more from you guys.
i've had a pretty bad life (no one's fault but my own), and smosh has been one of the only things to provide a light and a moment of relief my entire life, since I was a kid until now. I fully believe in Ian & Anthony to provide content that makes me smile, even when it's hard to. It doesn't have to be the exact same, as long as it's you two the magic is there. Thank you for giving so many years to us, for no reason other than to make yourselves and others happy. Congratulations!
I'm so happy for Ian and Anthony. Finally everything is working out for them. Can't wait to see their new content. 😊
Ugh that Smosh milk fanfic changed my innocent life for the worse
the video we all needed to heal.
I love you guys
I'm not quite sure how to put this but anthony's laugh makes me feel so warm and happy every time I hear it, it's so "🤭🤭🤭"
this is the reunion of all time
for some reason i once dramt of hanging out with the rwo of you. i never had any dreams of other you tubers but that.
Here is an opinion from stranger who remotely doesn't know what these guy really feels: I think Anthony feel betrayed by the company who bought smosh, because the company doesn't do justice to smosh, and extended feel betrayed to Ian because he decide to stick with the company (while actaully he just doesn't wanna lose smosh) While Ian feel betrayed to Anthony because he left smosh and left him alone to struggle with keeping smosh from dead.. Smosh is soul and shell, while company bought it the soul of smosh start fading at the point Anthony feels like the soul is gone and he decide to leave smosh, while Ian want to protect smosh to keep existing and not swallowed by Internet fast life cycle even if it's mean smosh is not smosh the way it used to in the beginning.. so yeah, now that they band together again the soul in which born from these two collaboration based on their friendship hope to reignite within the shell again..
1m view in 10 hours damn thats insane
E?!!
Everything came back around! Still remember being like 10yo watching dixon cider! Very proud and happy for both of you! (Ty for all the stupid nasty humor you embeded in me, I'm 23 now)
The dream team is back together!
I want a Smosh movie actually written by Smosh
I'm just happy to see two bros back together honestly
Bro
Just joking here but Try a drinking game where every time Ian says like you take a shot If you do that then you might blackout
The fanfictions are gonna return now
I actually kinda teared man
As someone who's been watching since 2009 this made me cry, glad to see you two come together ❤
Lord thank you
God, this chemistry! Their humour! I was a little kid when I used to binge their content all day on YouTube. Damn, time flies.
I never became a fan when Anthony and Ian were both in smosh but I knew that the channel was different than it was. To be able to see Anthony and Ian come back together and gain ownership of their project makes my heart smile so much. I feel as though smosh is going in such an amazing direction and I can’t wait to see their careers and channels thrive. Congratulations both of you!!
I’m 15 minutes in and I didn’t realise how much I needed this video. I held a lot of resentment for the industry that Smosh became. Seeing these guys get back to their roots is truly heartening
YouTube History.
Smosh is just a canon event for them
Chills. literal chills guys
I cried this is beautiful moment in history Smosh interview basically
Im so excited for you guys! I feel like your dynamic picked up right where it left off and im so so excited to see your new videos
I miss food battles
My childhood is whole again holy shit
I find it such a fascinating dilemma. Finding the line between being faithful the what Smosh is but also not falling to deeply into old patterns. I don’t envy that position but I look forward to the solutions.
**VIOLENT SCREAMING**
duuuuude... it's been so long since I heard someone said "rofling" 😍
This has been the best shock in my life, seeing these two back together is the best thing to happen. I hope all the things go well and so happy to see this happen <3
Bro, I disconnect from YouTube a couple of days and this shit happens 🥹❤ I’m so happy! I grew up with Smosh
51:42 This laugh sound is insane.
i can’t believe this. 2017 me would be shook
46:39 bookmark
the way Ian said "if we burn that to the ground, I am happy to do that with you" gave me chills
Who remembers the animated story times where they ditched school to get the halo helmet ?
holy shit i’ve missed these two. i grew up with smosh, i watched it constantly. i watched as mari joined, as the smosh games team grew, as smosh summer games came to a start! i watched as anthony left and as smosh fell apart a little, and then i stopped watching.   i started again this year. i started for damien and shayne, their personalities and i started for board af legacy. i love the personal relationships in smosh. and now, seeing anthony and ian back together. i’m so ready for this new era.
Food battle 2023 confirmed?
YAAAAY
Food Battle 2023 is gonna be wild
I can't believe they are back this is awesome.
Funeral of Anthony Padilla????? >>
This is a very honest talk outside of that brand consciousness. Its like Anthony’s magic brought too much warm moments. Now that they owned Smosh, feel like I can see how this Channel is gonna be like getting outside of that space of comedy and get real with people of smosh and the YouTube community ❤❤❤❤
Its been a while since I saw both of you guys, you guys made my childhood
thank you guys so much for bringing back up the milk fic. oh dear gods.
24 hour gang
You guys were a big part of my childhood and a big part of my adulthood. I'm so happy Classic Smosh is back. I'm still a big fan of it now but I'm just super hyped to see the OGs on my screen together once more.
This was a long time coming <3
This is nice. Like finally  having closure. Hearing both sides both experiences, and their thought processes and rationalizations at the time.
Two bros opens up with each other cause it's not gay
Still remember og Chinese basketball jersey wearing lip sync guys on the front page with you guys.
I quit watching around the time you guys were bought cause it wasnt my kinda stuff anymore. I feel what Anthony said. I think I even blamed Andy for being a sellout when Anthony left. Goes to show what goes on under the surface of all this kinda stuff. Love to see you guys reunited. resubbed to Smosh and will probably become a member there soon cause I love your guys humor. Welcome back <3
There should be a history of Amish the movie but as a biographical film of the history of smash and the effects it had on Anthony and Ian
I’ve missed you guys for so long 😢😢😢 So happy you guys got back together to express what you guys felt and clear up the tension
Wait yall own smash again!
I'm so happy you guys are able to take smosh back in the direction it was always meant to be. Just friends goofing off.
the boys back together for an interview
OK BUT FOOD BATTLE WHEN!!! I NEED TO SEE SPRINKLE DONUT IN ACTION
Wait who bought smosh? Rhett and link? What the hell?!!
Soo when is food battle 2023
Nature is healing
Now bring back the emo hair and bread hair
Just now realizing he calls him "Ry" because this was originally a Brendon Urie/Ryan Ross fanfic and they changed the names 💀
I can just say this was beautiful
Sad part is I actually have read a fanfiction a girl I know wrote it and I was like oh God, why am I spellchecking her mistakes like for example she had one word that was C – CK And it was with you, but I thought she meant it with a no and then I was like did she do this on purpose?
I know making movies sucks but you know, this experience about defy and antony leaving smosh seems to be a very good script for a movie. But taking the script seriously, i wanna see in person how angry was the staff of smosh taking alm frustrations when defy broke.
Seeing anthony and Ian together again healed my inner child
I never saw this coming, but I am so glad it did! As someone who grew up with Smosh, but fell off and only recently started to find my way back to Anthony and Ian's content, it really is crazy that this is happening RIGHT NOW. Congratulations you guys, and I can't wait to see what else Smosh will bring!
Well this is unexpected- I hope the new generation of younglings that's sprouted up since the early days of youtube (my god, I can't believe youtube is almost 20 years old) finds it and comes along for the ride! Welcome back boys!
I expected this
'we've never expressed emotions to eachother so this is great' 'I still wont' 'oh okay good'   seriously this is bants lmao
Lessss gooooo
shoutout diana
I remember memorizing ASSASSIN'S CREED RAP and singing it in 7th grade, I hated why  did that, but man do I cherish that era of me just watching smosh non-stop.
Can't believe Smosh is back
Bring back Mexican Anthony
Nice
😮
i love all bros. Bros love bros back and we do bro things. fuck ye.
The number of people on all my social medias that immediately jumped in on this cheering about it about a decade removed from classic smosh... Nature is healing and we are having negative carbon emissions yippee!!!!!
AHHHHHHH
I love it, and you guys were a huge part of my childhood. I wish you the best in your Future!
I grew up with these two. To see them grow so much as people and share their emotional burdens against each other in a healthy way made me felt proud. Normally i wouldent care slightest about some youtubers friendship. But man, these guys were my heroes back then so, even if they dont realise it, old fans of smosh are emotionally invested in this a lot. It feels like my childhood friends are getting together and resolve their issues.
So happy to see these guys collab again. I Hope they can grow Smosh again. I remember watching them in high school.
I'm stoked for their new episode, their first episode joined back as Smosh. I'm so stoked for their actual return when they start uploading 💯
This makes us understand many things which the general public may not be able to gage. Ian and Anthony on their own are pretty normal guys, but that is not what made them funny together. It was their on screen characters interactions that made it funny and entertaining. I'm very excited to be a part of yet another journey of theirs. I wish them the best of luck. Love from India 🇮🇳
I dunno know how long I can hold my happy tears back im so happy
I was 4 in 2006
You could do an "I spent a day with ex disney channel actors" and have Damien and Shayne over, then just not talk about smosh the entire video xD
10:57 that background audio is the same audio as Popcorn in Bed’s
Consistency is the key to many successful ventures. Even myself an empoverished white man with Cerebral Palsy. I consistently work at my health to maintain myself enough to be healthy, however I need better avenues for opportunity than my local ones. So I am leaning harder into music and art in general because It is where my passion is are. I also had low self-esteem for most of my life being disabled and my nearest supprort structures are too manipulative and cruel to me and my needs to be of any use besides an example of who to avoid in life. I just hope my journey pays off for the people who still care enough about me to let me be myself.
LET'S. FUCKING. GO.
The legend is back 😎
1m views in 9 hours…didn’t know the smosh community was hurting so bad for this 😅😂
Truthfully, I remember when Anthony and Ian came out with the video that he was leaving Smosh and distinctly remember crying, partially because he was leaving, but also because I feared their friendship was going to be severed forever and growing up watching Smosh since 2010, i had always aspired to find someone like Ian is to Anthony and vice versa. Fast forward to yesterday and the feeling I got knowing my two childhood idols were getting the band back together, my heart was overwhelmed with joy and it felt like my parents were getting back together after a divorce. 😅😅 i love you both, and i cant wait to see and anticipate new videos everyweek ❤🥺🥹
Now they got like the same haircut
You guys could do what the french youtube channel "Joueur du grenier" does. Their main channel is just a money sink because its mostly very high budget sketches. But on their second channel/twitch they do all the stuff that actually brings in money. And that channel's point is funding the main one where they do what they actually love.
nice
I WANT TO SEE SMOSH CAST AND CREW REACTING WHEN ANTHONY CAME TO SMOSH PLACE.
Bring back food battle.
The Smosh Movie was top notch!
I spent a day with Shane topp, Courtney miller etc.. ?
Okay but the real question. The one almost everyone is thinking. Is Lee coming back??
1 million views over night !!! Holy cow!!!
IT JUST GETS BETTER
I am really looking forward to seeing where you go with smosh and your future endeavors you are going to go on with this next step
Knowing these two since 2010 I am just happy to see they are friends again.
just those few minutes at the end managed to make me laugh more genuinely than I have since the old Smosh days
If any newer generation video game can replicate how the light bends at Ian's spectacle. I'd love to see it l.
Food battle coming soon? 👀
I'm so happy!!! The besties are besting
Is the world turning to a right direction?
Ik making decade old videos would not be popular but I for sure hope you guys do some old school smosh style videos. Either way, so happy to see you two back together. Let the redemption arc begin!
I only expect this to last around five years, but I'm definitely happy to see the reunion and I hope they are able to maintain their friendship through the years
FINALLY!
11:29 ^ I remembered those vlogs, they were awesome❕👏🏼    11:59 , 19:35 , 1:01:30 Ian - What friendship❔
I am so happy. The child within me is finally at peace.
pog
I swear this video was just them using the camera as an excuse to genuinely speak out about their feelings to each other 💀 (great video tho and I literally jumped out of my bed when I saw they're reunited)
Crazy there might be people watching who don't know smosh
ill shit my self if food battle was back
Seeing smosh as two grown adults talking it out hit me harder than seeing any "What is x personality doing nowadays" post. Unlike a lot of celebrities, these guys feel like they have matured and brought their lives to a point they feel comfortable with.
Wow what an interesting inside view to it all, thank you for sharing this with us and coming back together 🙏
Food battle must be the first video back
WOOHOO
No kidding, smosh was what made me get into youtube, and they were practically my childhood. I'm so emotional TT
This doesn't even feel like an interview, just 2 friends conversing about the old times and I love it.
YIPPIEEEEEE
Smosh is BACK baby
Spent a day with? My guy, you spent *many* days with and hopefully many more to come! Excited to see the new content!
I don't know these guys obviously so grain of salt but the vibes seem off here. Feels like there's a lot of growing together left to do
NO F WAY
Reunion of the duo.
Loved these two since I was a kid, never got into following many youtubers but these guys have always been #1 for me 😊
I remember watching you guys at the time, I was 10 years old and I’m 25 now. Insane how time flies, you guys really made my childhood great.
SMOSH IS BACK
HOW DID I FORGET THAT VIDEOS HAD STAR RATINGS! 😱
i grew up on smosh this is amazing
LETS FUCKIGNG GOOOOOO
Anthony is basically the Smosh version of Tom Delonge
I really hope to see the old intro somewhere in there, that always felt the most nostalgic to me
The day has come...
smosh collab with brandon rogers ????👁👁
I don't know why but it is so nice to see you together
This is amazing news for old fans. I was a fan of smosh games since it was pretty much created. And let that not be an understatement: Anthony DID NOT have to reunite with smosh in order to reunite with Ian or to have a career. If anything his career is as big as it ever was because he left. Coming back might put his new channel in big trouble. That is how much he loves his "smosh" child...
I feel so happy watching you two come back together.. I am totally a stranger, and I never know what you both feel, but following  the journey, I feel like I am watching a happy ending of a movie.. it's definitely not an ending because smosh just changed back into og smosh and can't wait to see the contents..
Aw, I genuinely got emotional when I saw this. I grew up watching Smosh with my brothers. When you guys posted we’d all get together and watch the new video together! Food battles were our Superbowls! Love you guys🥹🤍
my childhood
guess the gang is back again Feels like 7 grade all over again
smosh the tour when?
Goes to show the differences between being under toxic management in a toxic work environment and a positive employer and ethically run company. Defy was too corporate, and mythical has ALWAYS given greater opportunity to their staff that show creativity. Bad employers push out content for money, and expect employees to change themselves "for the brand" and overwork their employees. Good companies let their employees flourish, give out promotions, opportunity and genuinely care about their employees careers progressing. Good youtbers care about their audiences and providing happy moments and entertainment that they'd enjoy themselves, not pandering algorithmic fodder for children.
I actually only started watching Smosh during the pandemic and it was already with the new cast and they were already ouf of Defy. I liked what it was at the time and I continue to enjoy their content today pretty frequently. It was only after seeing a lot of the commentary about "old Smosh" and "Where's Anthony?" did I dig deeper to see just how different and how established Smosh was at the dawn of accessible internet media.  That said, this makes me incredibly happy. Knowing that you guys are back together and doing it the way you guys want it done is such a lovely thing. Defy almost completely broke your friendship and I'm so happy that both of you had that time apart to heal and do things on your own. It's rare to have friendships recover from such a nosedive caused by business.  I would kill to see Chanse get his turn to talk to Anthony and literally get updated by the guy that he never even knew existed until he joined Smosh.
Actual YouTube history being made. sadly Tfue is going but Smosh is coming. rollercoaster.
My childhood just lit up a little bit. My 12 year old self is crying tears of joy for the reunion.
This is freakin amazing 💜💜💜💜
its so weird how not even a week ago I sent one of my friends an old Smosh video and said it sucks that ian and anthony sold out and we'll never get them ever again. This video added a lor more context and Im so happy theyre reuniting.
smosh was my childhood. this has very pleasantly surprised me its truly amazing. i loved the annual food battle in particular
legendery
My childhood just revived
I feel like Ian is not opening up so much cause he might feel like he's gonna get hurt again.
Huge ups to Rhett and Link! Genuinely awesome people!
we waited so longggg
Made my entire year 😭
I really like that they are honest about it. The channel and their friendship.
the more i hear about Rhett and Link the more they sound like the supportive fathers of youtube, just helping and supporting other creators whenever they can
The first sketch these guys shot is totally gonna be Food Battle.   Obviously a reach but a man can dream
🥺 I want MOREEEEE
my childhood is back guys
Been watching since 2008 and I’m so happy to see you guys again together talking and patching up the past. Can’t wait for the new content love you both
Breakups can be beautiful, and this is what I'm seeing with these two. A beautiful, purposeful breakup, and a moment of realizing they needed this, but what they loved about their relationship wasn't gone.
I’m glad your back :)
I had a big goofy ass smile on my face this whole video🥲
Stop, why’d they know so much about those fanfics lmao? 😭  Anyways, I would pay good money to see behind the scenes stuff of you guys filming the new skits. I miss the days when we could go to your website to watch the behind the scenes content, but even MORE now that you guys are working together after such a long time and the whole filming dynamic I’m sure changing a lot
Is the smosh staff still working there? Like the writers?
smosh is a pure example of youtube business being luck, trial and error, and truly stressful. i’m so happy that they were able to get their company back and continue to strive as individuals 🩷 never would i thought i’d be so invested in these two youtubers but man… they are my childhood.
The irony of not having been able to talk about feelings and experiences unrelated to business for years.  To Anthony literally having a show about people sharing their personal experiences and having Ian come onto it after so many years of growth is poetic.
Beans
NAHHH I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS
I can't believe the boys are back!!
Hi Anthony i have a video idea for you  You could interview an ethical hacker  Like Ryan Montgomery it would be very interesting and would be a great video. ( Ofcourse I understand if he doesn't want to come to an interview I'm just suggesting you )
This was one big healing video in so many ways, thank you for sharing this!!
I hope they don't get too flustered with the money side of things again and focus primarily on making what they love.   Here's to an upcoming era of YT where we bring back shortform, scripted content and high quality animation/skits/short films. 🥂
It is such a great story You illuminated my adolescence with your video. Thank you
THATS GROWTH BITCH
"I still won't " cracked me up so much
This still feels like a dream, holy crap. I love you guys :D
The question everyones asking, whens the next food battle?
Wow let me just say what an honor it is to be a part of that generation of people during the Smosh golden era. So many great memories and laughs from two of the pioneers of YouTube itself and to hear that I have the pleasure to be a part of this again makes me beyond happy.  I never thought I'd see the day but I can't wait for what's to come
my heart was so warmed watching this that it almost feels like burning
As one of the many people that grew up watching Smosh, I believe this is big event for a lot of us. I started watching around middle school and I really enjoyed the content. It wasn't until I got older and grew into myself that I understood why. Both Anthony and Ian are around 10 years older than me. The sense of humor the two of them displayed resonated with me on a level I couldn't understand at the time. Now that I've grown and begun to understand my feelings I understand why it affected me so much. The two of them gave off this vibe of being the older brothers I got to hang out with. I got to take part in their jokes and enjoy being around people who wanted to make me laugh as much as they wanted to make each other laugh. So when Anthony left Smosh I was graduating high school. It was almost poetic in the way it worked. It felt like one of my older brothers had to move on at the same time I did. So around the same time I left Smosh too in a way. Of course I watched videos here and there to support the guys who worked so hard to keep it alive but it just wasn't something I consumed as much. Now with Anthony back it's like my older brother moved back home in a way. But we're all older and more mature. We're still gonna have that same sense of humor but it's gonna feel new again. Instead of me following around my two older brothers I get to feel like I'm old enough to understand.
this is like the beatles of youtube finally getting back together
OMAGAAHHH FINALLY THE MOST WANTED EPISODE OMG
The crazy thing about all of this is about 4 days ago is turned on a playlist that literally has every smosh video in order and was skipping around the playlist and laughing...a few days later i see Ian's tweet that says "tomorrow" and my first thought... Anthony's back...what else would have to be tomorrow 🥲
THEY’RE BACK!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
the power of therapy
I took a shot every time they said "like" and now I'm in the hospital... Thank you guys😂
It's crazy how I grew up to them and inspired to be them when I was a kid (I'm 32 years old), and now seeing their first videos and seeing how mature they are today.... feels so right 😭😭💖💖 Best 1:13:19 minutes of my life 😭
As someone who likes the old smosh videos very much, I hope they delete all the defy stuff from the channel.
42:00
I never watched smosh because I thought it was cringe. Might watch the new ones depending on how they are though :)
the way i screamed when i saw this in my recommended
What the Frick is the milk fan fic
I am so so glad to have you back I could cry rn
Wow I had no idea that your guys' friendship was almost gone. Thanks for sharing, and I'm excited to see yall on the trending page every week! 🔥
I think it’s really beautiful to reconnect, I’ve always been aware of smosh but never really consumed much of it bc I’m English so I was on the brittube side of content back then, but still it’s very moving hearing you talk about how you’ve been able to grow separately and rekindle all the positive emotions and memories without feeling like they are feeding into or threatening the hurt you both felt from the situation Sometimes rekindling friendships means just moving in parallel and wishing each other well, having the other person immersed in your life again is wonderful and imo really healing to the person you were when you first met - I feel like part of losing a friend that is so painful is the memory of that young person and how heartbroken they would be to know that the bond they cherished could break, being able to reform it with the emotional maturity to make it stronger can really mean everything to your old self All this to say, happy for you two bros in a studio five feet apart because they’re not gay
I love rhett and link 😢
The web camera was a cannon event.
the good ending
This has to be one of the big points in the next creator made youtube rewinds
when i saw the news that you guys got smosh back, the shock on my face is definitely very verrryyyyy much like pink sprinkled donut
Rhett and Link really proves that kindness goes along way.
1:01:50 so no food battle?😢
Did they get lunch
I somehow never watched Smosh and only not Anthony solo on this channel. But the way they told the story like that made me feel like I was part of the journey 🥲
My boys are back! Im SO HAPPY!🥳🥳💕💜👍
Your project represents everything that I loved about the original idea of Youtube. Thank you so much!
As someone who grew up with English as a third language and not from the west, when i was a kid i remember watching Smosh and laughing my ass off without knowing what some words mean, the context or even the reference. Now watching those videos makes me laugh even harder now, also helping a lot with my english to the point it's my main language.
My god, it's FINALLY HAPPENING  Welcome back, to the REAL Smosh
Will series like the funerals continue on the main channel or go to smosh pit?
Cyberspace celebrity is crazy ngl 😂
we’ve all been waiting for this one
Top 10 crossovers in history:
i’m excited to bring back some old content and old viewers who dipped, but i’ve gotten used to and enjoy the current main smash channel content. i think stuff like that should remain. and hope it does.
Here after seeing the announcement and try to laugh .. just so beautiful seeing you two back together . Shout out to Ian for hanging onto smosh all the way through and never faltering with his belief in it. Though I don’t blame Anthony for leaving either and I’ve loved this journey he’s been on with this channel , he’s grown so much talking to so many ! I feel Anthony and Ian both made the right choices really and now they’re both better for it . And now that they’re reunited , they can really bring something new together but that’s true to who they are now . Congratulations!
This is still so surreal for me to see man, I'm so happy to see you two make content together again after all these years! It just makes me happy to see this part of my childhood I thought would be gone forever brought back like this!
aaaaa I drank something I shouldnt of now my tummy hurts ,, anthony make it not sore any more plss
Never thought I'd see Ian and Anthony together again 🥰 I missed my Smosh boys. Thank you Rhett and Link for saving Smosh when it was low and then selling it back to the guys when the time was right
This is the best thing that has happened on YouTube in YEARS!!  I love you two so much, since the very beginning of Smosh when I was half the height I am now. Im SOOOO happy
Man I didn't think these Cyberspace Superstars could get back together and also bought back Smosh.
8 hours ago, 1m views and 140k likes.... This is going to blow up
A new era
I'm excited for this!!!
We can finally get Sex Ed Rocks 2!!!
First comment
❤
I'm soooooo excited
Can we get the real ‘Smosh: The Movie’ about the real life story of these clowns?
Why does it feel like Ian hasn't age a bit???....... it a good way
Smosh making a comeback?!
Man this is so cool, started watching smosh when I was like 8… I’m turning 20 this year
These two have good chemistry, I hope they make more content together soon
:)
I really enjoyed the Smosh movie. I loved all the crossovers and the microphone going up one of you.
It warms my heart seeing you two together again. It bring me a certain type of nostalgia when I was watching the old videos of smosh that made me laugh and smile. I am so happy to see smosh back. Thank you Antony and Ian for making my childhood. You two are actually some of the funniest people I know. Keep making more great videos on the smosh channel. I wait for more of them <3
In a some wat this is also a "I spent a day with Antony Padilla"
It's wild to see you two in a video again. I've been watching Smosh since I was a kid. I'm so happy that you got to buy Smosh back! Congrats, you two! And big ups to Mythical for letting this happen.
i hope both remember to stay happy, don't let the business run your lives. let your lives and who you are run your business. the community will definitely support you on this new journey, good luck.
❤ I'm so happy for both of you I've been following you guys since the beginning❤ Much love  Take care yourselves❤
I wonder how james will react @TheOdd1sOut
:)
You guys should do food wars just one more time
sex.
I needed this! I'm so excited about the new content!
I'm just wondering what this means for the other cast members. Will they only appear on pit and games or will they also appear on the main channel
Ian feels like he’s been aged and jaded by all that happened with Smosh. The way he talked about Smosh is like he’s talking about a machine that he can put together blindfolded because he’s had to fix it so many times over the years.  Anthony on the other hand seems to have a newly reignited passion and vision for Smosh, like an inventor with a new prototype in mind, seeing all the possibilities and changing niche it could fit in.  I wonder where this will bring the new Smosh, but I’m certainly keeping my eyes peeled.
I used to live a 10 minute walking distance from these two in Sacramento and knowing all of this was going on (obviously at a later point not still in their homes) actually hurts me inside. I’ve been listening to this so intensely and my inner child has been healed, truly.
SHUT UP!!!!!! ❤
I didn’t knew I needed this but now I’m super excited to start watching smosh again! But I hope Anthony keeps creating content to this channel, because this is gold!
I'm turning 22 soon. My first every youtube video i saw was the zelda rap by smosh.
Now all we need is cold ones and Joji together
Did we just shift from the worst into the best timeline?! Omgggg
First video food battle
Fuck, people needed this.  (It's me, I'm people, I'm fucking emotional 💙)
So are the Interviews on this channel going to continue?
Just re subscribed to smosh can’t wait for the new content with Anthony back.
Is this going to move onto the smosh channel?
41:55 broke me
Bro Ian’s glasses are fire af
Plot twist: Defy is coming back too
tear up a bit watching this
damn i cried, this video truly genuine talk between two friends
This is a Season finale
"What if we...bought Smosh?" "Dude! I was just!"  If this was a movie,this would be  the moment we cried like a baby.
I cried laughing with SMOSH when I was in elementary school, I cried with SMOSH when anthony left, and here I am now crying with Anthony on him and Ian getting back together…thank you guys from the bottom of my late preteen heart, as JSE said on his isadw, the little boy thats let out to play is very happy again right now.
I need and Anthony and Ian sit down with Rhett and Link ASAP!!!!!
This is going to be a new turning point for YouTube
Okay now give Anthony his Emo hair and Ian his bowl haircut. 😎
This episode is making me emotional as fuck holy shit
Rhett and Link are just officially the most supportive internet dads on earth. It warms my heart that they not only saved Smosh when Defy shut down, but also are the ones to hand back the torch to you guys after having had years to mature into the people you are now. Best of luck to you both. I'm excited to see what you'll get up to.
Ian is wearing the same shirt as the smosh profile pic. I believe Anthony has him trapped in a basement and forced him to "buy" smosh
LETS FUCKING GO
food battle 2023
Im seriousoy gald to see this happening, i was so sad 6yrs ago when Anthony just like cut off smosh entirely but I knew it was for the best for him and Smosh.   So happy to see its back under your guy's creative minds and being friends again. 12yr old me is happy and 28 yr old me is crying. Lol thanks for all the laughs and passion for thses years you 2. I wish you in being healthy and making happy choices. 🙏
ON MAMA THEY'RE BACK
Even Anthony goes back and watches old smosh sometimes lol
It’s the weirdest thing I was looking up about the two of these guys to see if they were still friends etc about 2 weeks ago, crazy
I’m waiting for food battle
This video is the definition of "See you again (feat. Charlie Puth) - Wiz Khalifa"
It good to see them together again
Still so proud that I can resite the legend of Zelda rap word for word
This is the good ending
Here I am in my early 20's watching some legends I use to watch back in elementary school come back together, still so crazy that Smosh is together again
EL SMOSH IS BACK
Collab of smosh will shape the internet for the better again
And all was right in the world
I miss these two on god
lord have merch, i didn't think I was going to cry today damnn
IAN AND ANTHONY TOGETHER??!?!?!!?
Still funny as ever man Wtf 😂😂
okay, Ian you need to get a bowl cut if yall expect us to take Smosh seriously
The true Smosh movie.
Finally
Happy tears… so many happy tears!!!
I wonder what food will be chosen next
Some days ago I rewatched a Slow Mo Guys video, specifically the one where they film for the first time after the pandemic. That video and this one made me tear up. Both genuine friendships, creative minds mixed together to work on something unconventional but so so cool. (Not as unconventional as it was 10 years ago, but still.) I didn't grow up with OG Smosh, I became a huge fan of the cast during the pandemic, but I'm still really looking forward to this new era. Stories like yours are so motivating I swear. I sincerely wish you two the best of luck ❤
I forgot that used to subscribe to Anthony and his ex vlog channel.
I already feel like a kid again just watching these two communicate in the same room, i really feel like this will be a new era for Smosh, a comeback era.
What a fuckin banger event to occur 🤘
I’m at the 36th minute and if this doesn’t end in the friendship BFF song they made, imma be very, very slightly disappointed 😂
I hope y'all make a Pokemon Theme or Mortal Kombat theme 2023 remake.
Luckily you guys have Shayne who knows psychology
This is legit some of the best news on the internet in such a long time
This is a dream come true 🥹💖
Full support. I'm excited and I'll be waiting to see your first project.
Let's be honest here. Ever since they got new people in the scetches it all went to heck. And it became worse when Anthony left. Glad these two are good. Legends in entertaining.
im waiting for the teleporting fat guy to be reborn
I'm so happy to see them together again
omg
idk maybe i need to rewatch the smosh movie but i really liked it when it came out LOLLL i mean i was 10... but i remember watching it over and over fr. i gotta rewatch it now to see LMFAO
food battle
im teary eyed. I'm so happy.
so weird, i stopped watching smosh after the split and now after all these years to see its back out of nowhere, i just hope it will last
I can offically die in peace… my actual childhood has reunited😢❤️
Ian and Anthony are soulmates
This is so wholesome
THANK YOU FOR THIS
Very excited for this! Remember your relationship to each other comes befores work. I hope no one gets burnt with these and the other workmates of smosh can adapt and are happy with it too. Lots of luck and love 😊
This interview made me realize that Anthony is truly a passionate creative and really puts his all into what he believes in. Ian doesn’t seem to be as emotional as Anthony and is more logical with his process. They seem to totally complement each other and put A LOT of work to build their relationship back up and running! I appreciate you two for doing that and so excited that what’s next for SMOSH!
This is YouTube heritage.
interesting
I feel like a 12 year old again this is amazing
You guys really hit me with this TvT we all know we were waiting for this interview and it must be personal for Anthony too since Ian is literally his closest buddy for a long time
Waited for years for this reunion.
Thank you for raising me, dads
as much as i agree that the direction of the channel should steer clear from recreating the nostaglia of the old smosh, it would be entertaining to see a WHAT IF MOVIES WERE REAL 10.
So fucking proud of you both
You love to see it
Sooooo that means we getting food battle XI ???
mom and dad are back together!
does this mean we'll get season 6 of smosh babies
Y'know in the Vsause interview episode, Michael said something along the lines of *_when you do something creative, especially on YouTube, you put yourself into it and you draw upon your well of life and when that well dries up, that's it._* He goes on to talk about how important it is to constantly live your life outside of your creative endeavors in order to keep filling up that well. I couldn't help but think about that conversation during this interview.
,,Even if it doesn't do well I know this is the right thing and If we burn it to the ground I'm happy to do that with you" ok Ian, I cried. That was a wholesome moment. I'll support you guys no matter what. All the best 💚💙
MY LIFE CAN ONLY GO UP FROM HERE.
HAHAHAAHAAAA OMG
The scream I scrumpt when my brain processed that this is real
So, is Smosh back?
As someone whose been with you since the god same beginning.  Welcome back Anthony. Its good to see Smosh Be smosh again
I spent a day with new smosh cast when XD
I was part of the smosh food battle era and pokemon stuff, mom sketches.. etc.. and i remember when the company bought smosh and things were changing like ALOT AND too fast, i stopped watching. I think i watched up until they release the mobile app game. And than i remember hearing that anthony left smosh, which was shocking.. and than a lot of years later, my youtube algorithm showed me smosh with bunch of different ppl, which was weird at first.. but started to like some of the content. And now its so cool that they are back at it. Idk how old i was back then but im 23 now!
these two people are my childhood
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This one is for the YouTube veterans 😎 just started watching, but I'm so happy for this interview / collab!
Don't forget about Corridor digital. They might make different content conceptually but they also have massively expensive productions, 2 friends at the helm and an empire. Can definitely be inspiring to look at what they do!
they sound so diffrently now  i miss smosh
1:11:37 dunno about yall but I’m definitely not crying
YES THANK YOU
Smoshhhhh
I felt like this wasn’t just an interview but a couple’s therapy as well HAHAHA I’m so glad to see OG Smosh again after more than half a decade!!
Can’t believe that we’ve had Anthony back at Smosh and now THIS! So happy for u guysssss
I like that you guys are back together and getting Smosh back and Rhett and Link were happy for you guys when you approached them about buying back Smosh and making videos and have a membership for people who are fans that stayed with the channel ever since it's founding. Fans wanted this to happen ever since Anthony left Smosh to do his own thing and Ian doing stuff to not have Smosh go downhill from the Defy Media shutdown. But now everyone is going to support you guys before they watched you guys from the beginning.
Yay!!!!
hearing them talk makes me realize how well they complete each other, the are so different but in a good way
this is so amazing..... the world is healing
I think my favourite part of this video is hearing them talking about not being friends. I always think about how I'd love to have a conversation with the people I've lost connections with over the years and truly hash things out and seeing two people I really admired when I was younger do exactly that is cathartic!
This is equivalent to "Smosh: A documentary" and I'm super here for it
This doesn’t feel like all of his previous interviews. The camera angle on Ian feels a little different than on anybody else. This isn’t an interview, this is a real discussion between the legends, that we grew up on. Thank you ❤
IS THIS EVEN REAL LIFE????
Smosh saga continues.🎉
Food Battle 2023 when?
I'm so glad they're back I can't wait to see what these two do
Everything happens for a reason people need to grow as a person to appreciate each other company and not take each other for granted. I face a similar dilemma with my childhood friend whom I spent all my days together (we started watching smosh around the same time) for 11 years plus yet we grew apart and fall and then reconnect on some level once we mature more so I know how it feels on some level to go through it all. At the same time from the beginning of time just like music industry some company coming forward owning ur  talent (because they do not have talent) record label making u fly in a private u think u so cool they paying so much yet u don't realize they making probably 80-90% of the profit which after trickling down u make so little 10-20 %. Anthony was right at a certain time you guys after being under a company influences making new contents probably both Ian and Anthony experience quadrupled and much more at the same time burning yourself up by overtime. Ian did not have realized earlier just like Anthony did but Ian was scared of the idea of owning and doing things all by themselves at the same time it's the right thing to do.  People need time to appreciate and understand what is the right thing to do? - Just going independent owning your own things is the right way to do it. I love when Ian said the line that " Even if it not go well I know it is the right thing and if we burn it to the ground I am happy to do that with you". I love you both Anthony and Ian ❤. I have been Ian in some situation of my life  and Anthony too but I commend  Anthony for having the vision earlier before Ian did. I love you brother Anthony Padilla ❤and Ian ❤ for making us laugh all these years. I stopped watching after Anthony quit smosh because I love him a lot and was heart broken about everything but I understand Anthony. I am with u always Anthony even when u were struggling to find ur own voice bros before hoes haha.  Excited & love to see future projects together from u two best friends ❤.
I was 13 and made my first girlfriend put on the smosh movie and we made out to it, there ARE fans of the movie 😎
holy shit this makes me remember Smosh the game
'Smosh is appealing to kids' Molester Moon incomming
they say “but like” simultaneously at 21:32 it’s honestly so sweet and wholesome to see them settle back into their friendship
next up, smosh games with the original game bang crew!
You guys deserve this ❤❤
This interview feels less of a interview and announcement and more of a much needed therapy session
They have really great chemisry, they should make a youtube channel together
YO SMOSH IS SMOSHING AGAIN?!
Id say good mythical morning is like the successful child who took in their father Smosh during a midlife crisis and helped him out because Smosh started YouTube 7 years before GMM
Ive been watching smosh since probably 8 years old. I was literally obsessed as a child. Every time i visited my mom, i would use her shitty laptop to watch Smosh videos and browse the website. I also got made fun of in 6th grade for doing the Boxman dance on the playground... lol
Does anyone know what Anthony’s shoes are, I need them!
Food battle 2023????
finally
THE RENAISSANCE OF YOUTUBE!!!!
i was just watching a playlist of old smosh mailtime and lunchtime videos and the changes are so stark. it's almost cathartic to watch, it's amazing
im bout to cry bro 😭😭😭😭
Maybe Ian is always like this, but he seems like he has a strong wall up towards his emotions.. I feel bad because maybe he was more hurt than he let on
AWWWWWWW, MEMORIES
hmmmm
This is a historical moment for YouTube, and it's wonderfully poetic that it's just two friends talking about their relationship. Its not dramatic or hyperbolic, it's just an earnest moment about a friendship tied to a business, and the process of that separation and re-connection. It's truly heartwarming and fascinating having been a kid that watched you both as Smosh, and now seeing you both come together after a long and arduous journey as adults as I now also am. I feel nothing short of honored to witness this moment, as a lot of us audience members have also been through our own trials and tribulations- and I can't speak for everyone of course, but I have come a long way from who I was, and it gives me so much joy to see proof that people can change and grow, while still being true to who they are; to not punish ourselves for our mistakes, and to forgive ourselves for doing what we feel is right at any given moment, even if it seemed wrong to others. Thank you Anthony and Ian for doing what you do, never change, but ironically, keep changing, keep trying, and keep living, and I will do the same, no matter what comes my way. Hopefully, I will learn from the mistakes I make, and grow in ways i'd never expect, just as a lot of us never expected to see this video.
Take a shot every time Ian says "like"
Hi Ian wanna ask how u lost all the weight cos last time when I saw u at lunch with Ian u were kinda flabby and now u are skinny legend. Please give us some tips senpai
This still feels unreal, im crying  CONGRATULATIONS GUYS, LOVE YOU ALL
Genuinely the best episode yet, it was so touching seeing these old friends have such a real conversation
I would never think that İ see those two collab each other?!?!?
the world is healing (even a little bit and it helps).
Return of Food Battle anyone???
Wholesome
SMOSH IS BACCKKK!!!!!
I watched Smosh the whole entire way, until Anthony left when Defy was running things...I really disliked Defy for doing that, and I hoped EVERYDAY that after Defy went to heck that Anthony would come back...now the day is here..thank heavens
FOOD BATTLE 2023!
You guys always will have the Smosh magic you had when you first started. Your sketches were always good because you cared and you genuinely knew what made each other laugh and you felt so many others would laugh too and man! were you both right. I can't wait to see what you guys as rightful owners of Smosh create together again ❤
Ian is being too grumpy. what's wrong with going back to the old style. Just try and find out how many people will watch it
I stared watching Smosh 2019 and have been hooked ever since it has always broken my heart seeing Ian not being praised enough for his work that he continued to do, it has helped me trough a lot. So Ian appreciation💗💗
❤❤
Anthony Padilla spent a day with Ian Hecox, oh my YES, this is big, this is Nostalgia, reunited,  Anthony and Ian WHERE Smosh, they where what Smosh truly was, back in the good Days, Smosh was them,  and the classic Intro *SHUT UP* Oh this is Nostalgic~ 😊😊😊
bros didn’t mean to make us all cry but it happened
I loved Smosh The Movie. I remember when I was a kid and y’all announced it, I was so excited to watch it and every once in a while I still watch it
I want to write a Smosh fanfic again. I remember calling Anthony "Ant" 😂
It honestly feels like Ian’s a little reserved here still mostly open but he still hasn’t opened up from his perspective but you can tell there’s a lot of love there even if it’s being hidden by the remaining feelings of abandonment betrayed isolation whatever it is he’s felt
Bro I totally forgot anthony was in smosh. I was bouta search if he was part of smosh and now I just feel stupid.
This should be trending
literal tears
I CANT BELIEVE THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DONT KNOW WHO CHARLIE IS
Man this makes me nostalgic
FOOOOOOOOOD BATTTLLEEE!!!
YES
"If we burnt it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you." Wow, that made me tear up - such a beautiful friendship that has had ups and downs, but never truly died. This makes my younger self really happy seeing you guys together again - you always make me laugh 😄 I feel like you rejoining and reconnecting also reconnects a lot of us to our child-like selves again - so excited to see what you create. Good luck, Smosh!
When Anthony choked up, I did too - I’m so happy for you guys 🙏🏼♥️
THEY'RE BACK!!!
lmao I always wanted to believe you guys where still friends.
so this episode is vlog huh
Most heartwarming reunited friendship ive seen all year.
The MAGIC was Ian and Anthony. Period. Their friendship. Congrats, Smosh. 🖤🤍  Man, saying those two names together again takes me back to lunchtime with Smosh and I'm sure they fucking hated it. Hahaha. Literal tears and goosebumps rn.
Honestly, Ian sticking around for so many years has finally let us get the old Smosh back - hats off to him! And I love that we get to witness two bros having such a healthy conversation about their friendship, really shows how mature they are behind the scenes!
that sponsor segment gave me a fucking heart attack.
does this mean lunchtime with smosh can come back? SMOSH has made me laugh during the dark times in college..now that im in another downward spiral,, hearing this is just enough to make my day
Does that mean you guys will collab again soon..?
I grew up watching smosh but after Anthony left I slowly started to watch it deteriorate until it got to the point that despite being subscribed for 6 years at that point I felt like I had to leave because it just wasnt what I loved smosh for, I carried on watching Anthony and seeing him here with Ian, well that's making me go back and resub to smosh cause god damn I'm looking forward to the new content
41:55  Anthony (teary-eyed): "...and we never even expressed emotions to eachother. which is great." Ian (looking dead inside): "I still won't."
HE'S GROWN SO MUCH OMG SMOSH!!
What an arc!
Looking up the milk fanfic brb
i liked the bling part. Seriously both of you are crazy handsome it's kinda shocking
Yes yes yes 😮
This is a really deep cut but I remember being so exited when they collaborated with pewdiepie for the first time. I used to watch the smosh second chanel and I loved the vlogs and the fan mail opening 😂
Anthony is also a fellow auto immune soldier?! 🫡
I love Ian so fkn much, I started watching Smosh in 2019 and I caught up on a lot of old Smosh, the summer and winter games so it’s very touching to see them reconnect. I’ve always appreciated Ian staying. 💗 Their content during 2020 was so amazing and has helped me trough alot and so Smosh Cast being back, Anthony being back and kinda Ian being back and getting to shine absolutely melts my heart💞
The rightful kings have returned
I want a food fight this year
children do indeed love your sense of humor. I watched you guys when I was like 7........ probably not the best idea lmao
"If we burn it to the ground I'm happy to do that with you" is the feeling we needed.
Im getting nostalgic wow
The Reunion of a century
Why do I feel that Anthony do let up now that they're back together, working together, while Ian will only let up when he sees that Smosh is back and what it was back then when they're were created it as teenagers is still alive.  I feel like Anthony is just more relaxed now that they're together and all the old frustrations are gone, while Ian is more skeptical and more focused on what will it bring, how things will turn out. And man I just want to see him as fulfilled as Anthony is now. All the best to you guys!
thank u rhett & link 😭
When I was a kid I watched the smosh movie and cried during the part where they split up and get mad at eachother
Who’s cutting onions
IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!!
Congrats you two🎉
Who else remembers Anthony’s SpongeBob boxers? 😂
❤❤❤
"If we burn this to the ground, I'm happy to do this with you." Fuck, man, that's probably the sweetest thing anybody can say.
smosh is my childhood and i hope other kids around the world can experience the smosh we all knew
Are yall ready for food batlle?
When Ian sayd "I still wont", made me laugh so hard.
They made youtube what it is today.
The amount of love and support that I see in the comments is insane. The sad reality is that I have never seen so many positive comments in a row like this in a comment section in a while. But that ultimately means that we all are so happy to see you two back together not just for a little bit but as the LITERAL OWNERS OF SMOSH. You raised so many of us and basically made most of the YouTubers you see today. Especially me.   I also wanted to point out the amazing statement by Ian when he said that even IF this decision you two made together was ultimately what brings down the company into flames, then he’s happy to burn it down with Anthony. And god that friendship and resilience is just unbelievable. Welcome back Ian and Anthony.
I waited so long for this Smosh reunion to happened between Ian and Anthony, god bless you both Anthony and Ian
Ngl i was skeptical but by the ene of the video ive been laughing and cant hide a smile. I hope it goes well. Nothing is perfect right away and not everything will stick but I'm open and happy to see them both together again.
i doubt this is the first time Anthony has spent a day with Ian
We better get a Food Battle!
...whats the milk fanfic
I worry that them relying on memberships in order to fund sketch comedy night not work. Dropout (CollegeHumor) is now pretty much entirely dubbed by subscriptions, but all of their biggest content is unscripted, I don't know if they do ANY scripted content these days.  Don't get me wrong, their "unscripted" content is wonderful, extremely created and often requires a lot of thought / work / planning ahead of time. But my point is a company that was once entirely sketch comedy, could do continue doing sketches under a subscription model.
here before 1M
You guys could honestly reboot Smosh the Movie, except make it an official mockumentary of how you guys started, what went wrong, what happened afterwards, and where you guys are now.
Antwon and ian smoking that pack
The kid inside me is so happy to see you both together again! Thank you, Rhett and Link (GMM)
thank you both, you made my depession way better. you made my childhoot a tonne way better.
Two of my favourite heroes😢  Seeing this is like seeing the end of an epic arc or something.
Amish was my childhood i can’t believe this is happening oh my god
These two are icons and I'm so glad Smosh is finally back in both of their hands. Smosh has always been a huge part of my childhood and I've kept up with it over the years. With all the awful stuff happening on the internet right now, this is finally something good to look forward to <3 I'm so proud of them
Glad to see you two together again it has been years when can you start making those short videos i kinda miss them now i watch them all atleast 10 times repeatedly just waiting for you guys to return just like your minecraft dog waiting for you to return in the server
It feels like Steve Jobs is returning while Wozniak stayed. I know that isn't historically accurate but...
ianthony 4l. who is gonna write the fanfic ab this interview
first video back should be food wars. Dont know how well it'd go in todays youtube but it'll warm so many hearts
I've been watching Smosh videos for as long as I can remember, this is insane, I hope this is the start of an exciting new adventure for the two of you and that you both have fun making the content you guys want to make, I look forward to see what direction this takes you
I am losing my absolute whole entire mind over this
OK I am now super curious about the milk fanfic but at the same time...I do want to be able to eat food again so....
This is what we waiting for
IAN AND ANTHONY WERE WALKING DOWN AN ALLYWAY WHEN THEY THOUGHT A NOISE COMING FROM GARBAGE.
While all this is going on, as fans, we must thank Mythical! Without them, Smosh might have died with Defy or be bought by some other company who wouldn't let this happen. Thanks Mythical, for rekindling our childhood!
Oh my gosh ❤️
I'm so excited for this. I grew up with smosh and sadly stopped watching when Anthony left because it never felt the same. I did now and then watch bits on Facebook or tiktok but that's about it. I'm so happy that you guys once again own smosh congratulations guys. I hope to start watching you all again ❤
I am in bloody shock!!! So happy for you guys.
11:47 haha the daily vlog era is madness
This video is going to give so many newer Smosh fans a better perspective on Ian. I love it. Legendary duo 🖤
I like this Ian guy, I'm glad Anthony is giving smaller YouTubers like these a chance
This made me laugh 41:57 because Ian cares so much about Anthony deep down but it manifests in humor ❤
okay. favorite episode. happy to see you both again T_T
Please bring back the SHUT UP intro
Its so heartwarming and heartbreaking to see what you both went through. But the fact you guys confronted your feelings is so important. It inspires me to know people need time apart. Even best friends especially when you almost forget to feel things and feel yourself and be honest about what's going on. You guys are absolute true friends because everything that was troubling your friendship was everything surrounding both your lives nothing to do with your actual relationship. Im so happy you guys talked EVERYTHING out. Its so important. Love you both ❤
i can feel my 10 year old self scream  i did not think i would wake up in these news and the two videos that put the biggest smile on my face cant wait to hear the old SHUT UP intro
ian looks like gordon freeman. never noticed that before.
YOOOOO WHAT
I didnt know how much struggles they had before Smosh got sold, I never watched it after they sold it, because their magic disappeared.  Man I also have to say Ian has changed so much, damn. And I had no idea that their friendship was that rocky in the end :o I had no idea

and all is well in the world again
This was a cannon event
Oop
BBF!
The bands getting back together🎉🎉🎉
This episode basically turned into a podcast. Interesting to hear what was actually happening behind the curtain and how things are now. Good luck moving forward!
They’ve never been hotter. Grate style and in touch with their feelings
Literally Ian is link and Anthony is Rhett
My two favorite Cyberplace Celebrities!
We need another ‘IF THE DEATH NOTE WAS REAL’
The long awaited interview
The legendary duo
This makes my heart very happy
the world is healing
Watching their pokemon videos as a kid to now watching them talk about feelings as an adult is so bizarre.
I love this so much, my heart is healing. The universe is healing, LITERALLY.
I fuckin miss this duo, thank god they have reunited again, this is like the greatest comeback in the history of youtube
"and if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you"  fucking legendary.
If they make food battle it's going viral
Anthony when I saw you and try not to laugh I thought it was in a weird dream; And I'm proud of you get to do some smosh once in a while.
I can die in peace now 😌
Just 2 guys being bros
I can listen to you guys forever
Two bros, chilling on a Youtube, 2 feet apart coz they're not gay ❤
So THEY BOUGHT SMOSH back from GMM?? They own SMOSH back?! Wow if they really comeback to the top, this would be a big comeback story. Just hope it wasnt too late, since youtube really changed so much and now I barely seen youtubers from 2010-15 lingering around on trending or even uploading videos. Now its full of twitch clippers, memes, tv show/networks, and new creators that probably younger than SMOSH themselves.
rekindling the spirit of a bromance
woah
Rhett and Link are legit Gigachads. They are so kind to help out like this
I am so happy today. Wow. Thank you so much.
This has to be one of my favorite videos Anthony has done he has done something interviews but this has given such a new view on Smosh that we never got to see because of this I'm even more excited to see this return of Smosh and the sketch comedy
😭😭😭 I'm in tears
Maybe there is some hope left for the rest of us?
Well this was everything ❤️
Im definitely re-subscribeing to Smosh now
I've been waiting for this moment for so long.
IAN SUCKED MY TOE BACK IN 6TH GRADE
Thanks for the nostalgia! I’m so excited for new smosh videos
frens
This is better than my parents undoing divorce
Bring back “cancelled smosh videos” I wanna see the krazy kwilting klub
Whoever has the link and assassins creek costume need to give that shit back
Ehat year is it?!?!
Dynamic duo
My childhood. I love you two so much.
Man I know it’s kind of corny but I’m cried seeing the smosh profile pic be Ian and Anthony man. For some of use that was a big part of our childhood.
Damn the vulnerability in this video. Proud of my boys.
I’m proud of both of you
Holy shit. Been watching Smosh for 15 years. I'm 33, with a wife and 2 kids, and I hope my kids will get to enjoy Smosh content growing up. Here's to another generation of Smosh. Holy shit.
19 year old here. i grew up on smosh. And omg, this is amazing to see. I had unsubscribed from smosh but now im back. Love this.
oh my god
Stoked to see you two back together!! Gotta get Rhett and Link to guest star in a sketch
IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE. THIS IS MY CHILDHOOD
This is the most I've seen anthony talk in any episode
The most wholesome moment in YouTube history at least these days ❤ thank you I had same feeling towards Smosh like it lost its mojo and seeing y'all together again could bring a whole new leap. Thank you Anthony & ian
Ian looks like he could be the new 4th Try Guy
This is amazing news for Youtube community. Kudos to Rhett and Link for being such awesome dads 🍾🫰🏻
This feels more like a couples therapy session rather than an interview and I'm living for it
Could not be happier to see the two of you back together on my screen again!! cant believe its been so long, so happy for you both and cant wait to follow along this new journey with you, 15 and 26 year old me is squealing rn
Next Episode: FOOD BATTLE 2023!!!
Im so excited for the future of smosh
I didn't think I'd watch an hour+ video on this but every moment of this was great to watch. Seeing you two being so reflective, talking through everything casually, even when you weren't on the best of terms was a treat. You have both matured over the years and seeing you acknowledge all these things is a great way to show your growth. Im excited for the new Smosh, might jua6t re-subscribe!
Been watching smosh since like 2011 or 2012, super excited for what's to come!
I watched smosh starting at like age 10 and I’m 26 now you guys were Fr a part of my childhood thank you 😭
LETS GO
Ugh, now I'm having war flashbacks to the milk fanfic, thanks Ian... 🤢🤮
Anthony leaving and coming back to smosh was a Canon event
I only started watching Smosh in like 2018, so after Anthony had left but the fact these two got Smosh back gave me goosebumps. I'm happy for them
I’m so stoked you own Smosh again. That’s legendary. Congratulations
I didn't really watch Smosh as a kid so I don't have that nostalgia for the original videos, but I'm still so excited for this. I started becoming a fan of Smosh honestly around the time Defy went down, like right after when they were trying to scramble to come back and later when Mythical bought them. Since then I've seen such a positive change in the brand, and this just feels like the cherry on top. Things are great again and the Smosh renaissance is really happening.
Is the world healing?
Smosh isnt smosh without these two together
I've never felt this ecstatic..
Anthony and Ian back together again after everything and all this time has somehow helped heal my inner teen I swear haha.
Its crazy how theyre both so mature mentally now haha
warms my heart to see these two in such good terms <3
why is anthony wearing cowboy boots sorta things
My favourite bit of all of this is at the end of the video in the "bloopers", because it really expressed how well they still connect after all these years
😁
Anthony getting back into somsh at this time is a canon event
Heroes of my childhood. Thanks for all amazing videos you guys made.
I laughed audibly when i heard the news saying "cyberspace celebrities". That's peak 2005.
As someone who grew up watching ryan higa and smosh in the early days of youtube. My heart is so happy to see this episode. I always wondered what happened towards the end and you both wore your hearts on your sleeve and became more grounded than ever. I cant believe it has been 17.5 years im almost 30 now lol. All love to this community <3
Does this mean the world will heal again? 🥹
The world is healing
Free Ghetto Smosh
So glad Smosh is finally back
This feels like a real gamble to me. Sketch comedy isn't doing well on youtube these days and i can't imagine that Anthony is going to save it. Im looking forward to the smosh content with him, but I'm worried that a lack of success is going to harm their relationship again.  Anthony's content works so well, because he talks to interesting people, but when it's just him an Ian, it might not work anymore.
Damn, you can tell there's still some animosity due to how things happened.
It's so interesting to see how much Anthony and Ian has changed based off the paths that they decided to walk after letting go of each other. Anthony found himself and became more open and free and internally aware of himself, Ian had to toughen up and survive with the company which made him more reserved compared to his old self. They have both changed so much, but I'm so glad that they were able to look back and remember the core moments that brought them together in the first place ; eventually reconnecting them back to the same starting line. Wishing you guys all the best and I'm excited to see a new and fresh Smosh!!
genuinely, thank you. thank you for this. this is all I ever wanted from you guys. I cannot wait to see what you guys do from this point onward. I will be watching all of it. I cannot wait. I am so happy.
I’m glad you guys are back with Smosh!
OGs would be getting goosebumps rn.
I'm so glad that this is a long one, I'm looking forward to this
This need to be named as I go to therapy session together with Ian Hecox
I’m glad you’re back but please NEVER bring back Oishi high school battle
Finally, we've stumbled into a timeline that I can get behind 🎉
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do it with you." 😭😭😭
NO WAY YOOO ITS MY BDAY
Making giggles for 8 year olds
hey are you guys willing to let ghetto smosh continue to create content?
When ian talked about pissing on the president of defy's desk, it just reminded me of the video where they talked about pooping on the hotel rooms walls to get a bigger room 😂
I didn't think I could love Rhett and Link anymore than I already do, but here I am.
I have never joined a channel has a member before, haven't even considered it.  But Smosh has been here since I can first remember, 2000 baby, and I want them to succeed.  So i would fully throw them a dollar or few each month.
I’m really starting to understand more of Shaynes defy media character he did for Ian’s exes vid💀 8:30
My favourite thing about this "I spent a day with" is that Anthony contributing to the conversation. Not that he doesn't usually contribute, it's just that those are always more interview format and this has real deep conversation vibes. Like he's part of the story that the guests usually tell. In a regular interview there's a lot of "oh really?" and "wooooow" from him. It's almost like he's also featuring in this episode.
Love this <3
I understand both their Perspective and I am so glad they managed to get past the experiences they had and go back to the Good Old Days they spent together.   Also Both thier clothes show thier personalities back in their Time under Defy Anthony in dark cloths and Ian in Colourful Bright Cloths
You say that Ian and Anthony being bored and eating Lunch Vlogs are back? :D
I highly doubt either Ian or Anthony will read this, but I just wanted to say it's very important for them to inform the audience and emphasize on how important the new subscripcion method is essential to the success and sustainability of the new Smosh era... I really don't want this proyect to flop, but I know it won't.   Also, really glad you are back!
today a very important part of the internet came back to life, thank you and good luck <3
YouTube gets intersting again
When Ian said ‘comfort channel’   That hit home. Never thought of channels I watch to be that! Makes sense whilst watching but also not watching but just to have them on as back ground noise & reruns ❤
Yes finally
You sneaky bastards, you've really outdone yourselves and gave us a huge surprise! I'm super excited for your new sketches aside from SmoshCast returning!
I beg of you not to f it up with injected californjanja leftoidism. I beg you. Everything has been infected with leftoid politics. I will have massive respect if you dont do that.
I loved the movie! <3
I love this so much LETSSSSGOOOOOOOOO SMOSH IS BACK 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ian is what Seth Rogen would be if he never smoked weed
Wow, simply wow.
I like how anthony casually dropped this episode like any other one
I'm just 3 years younger than them so this, to me, is like watching my two older brothers talk after an incredibly long time. Seeing them together... Hearing them actually talk to each other about what happened. It's kind of soul-stirring, isn't it?
It's like we've come full circle
❤
Thanks guys for making us laugh for years and making YouTube what it is.
What a great collab its like they were friends before
this felt like therapy
Its time for them to acknowledge ghetto smosh now
When i was a kid and smosh ended i didn't understand why , its kinda therapeutic to listen this at my 20 s
I’m so happy for you guys and for the fans(me)! so glad to see you guys together and hear your stories :)
Never thought I’d see the day.
I’m 20 now I still quote “stuff my balls with mutant jelly la la la la la la la la la- SHUT UP” 😂
The world is truly healing. <3
YEAAHH!!!
I don’t even like sketch comedy but I’ll give Smosh a try for Anthony 😄
The "View to Likes" ratio on this video is perfectly reflective of how much we all support this
This feels like my childhood is coming rushing back the front door and smashing trough the wall besides it. I was growing content on thinking smosh would forever be, what it has become (I am not complaining I like most of the new cast, just kinda being sad). But with that first announcement video and just Ian's mom walzing in the room together with the trademark yellow arrows. Just *Mwahh* Chef's Kiss.
This *points* THIS is what active healing looks like, ppl!!!
I love that it’s not an interview just two old friends talkin …
I love how awesome Mythical has been with this. They bought SMOSH when it was at its all time low and they helped it out, Rhett and Link are basically older versions of Ian and Anthony so I feel like they really sympathized with the situation and it’s so cool how willing they were to let SMOSH go. They literally took in a baby bird and freed it once it’s broken wing healed.
Yooooo, it finally happened
The is the best birthday present I’ve ever had 😭
So weird that just a week ago I watched some old smosh videos because being old is boring, and now this?! ❤ Best of luck! You found each other again and it shows! 😊
God bless Diana
RETT AND LINNK MVPS! TRUE OGs!
I didn't think I'd cry. Man... Glad y'all were able to rekindle...
FINALLY!!!!!
I really like what Anthony created on his own. I mean this is cool, but I rather like this more mature version of him. So I hope this doesn't stop his current videos also.
I’m a piece of shit sorry Ian and Anthony
Makes me so happy and just cures whatever sick feeling I just had.  So glad they’re coming back to what they loved.
Yayyyy. They’re BACK!!🫶
the family reunion
Just kiss already.
Never a fan of smoshes cast- felt like I was watching a kids show. I say create content for your grown up audience (:
i'd love to see a mail time with smosh at least one last time
This is so amazing, and the small little nod to Mykie for helping Anthony to get to a place, where he felt comfortable finall sharing his emotions is so fucking great.
I feel a sense of revitalization seeing you and Ian together again. I grew up on Smosh too, watched Smosh on my old ass iPod, and old clunky Mac computer in high school. I bought merch and I bought and watched that movie!! And then, I grew up. Life happened. Most of it felt awful and still kind of does but seeing you two together again, reuniting and being better for it, gives me a lot of hope for my own life.   Smosh was silly and fun. In the grand scheme of history and the world, I don't think it would be remembered as anything significantly historical or pivotal. But in my own teeny life, it was and suddenly is again. So thank you to you  both for overcoming all your own hardships and growing into the people that you are today to be able to come back together to do what you love and are passionate about. I hope and know you'll do great things together!
so when is the pink frosted sprinkle donut coming back?
This is like the Beatles getting back together for my generation.
I don’t know any of you people (the other commenters) but I feel like we are so connected in this celebration
YES THE WORLD IS HEALING
Im just wondering what’s gonna happen to the other cast members
padildo and cocks together in a video? i gotta see this
The OG duo back together on my screen...........never thought this day would come, it brings tears to my eyes and my inner 13 year old is screaming his head off.
where is... wait a min.....
I saw the thumbnail and I was like "Oh, cool, Anthony is going to interview Ian from Smosh", complety missed what's going on and when I started the video everything clicked like "Wait...this is a big deal"
as someone who started watching smosh back around 06/07 and was completely obsessed back in the day, i can’t wait to see what this new era of smosh brings!
so, are you guys hiring?
Legendary interview
So uhm, up for a food battle 2023? 😂😂😂
Are we all just gonna ignore that Anthony's impression of Ian was *spot on*
we definitely need another smosh movie, but this time about Anthony and Ian’s story. Absolutely amazing
MY HEART!!!! I LOVE YOU GUYS BEEN A FAN FOR THE LONGEST <3 GLAD Y'ALL ARE BACK
So no food battle 2023
Sometimes, I forget Anthony was my childhood, and not just a channel that popped up.
Not me crying the whole time
I love how they dont even know how relatable this is on a lot of people’s friendships. Like for me it was healthy if we stopped talking for a while. It 100% work if you guys just fully disconnect then its not meant to be it.
This is actually insane ❤🎉
Thank you from the bottom of my heart <3
milk fic? **lights cigarette** i haven’t heard that name around these parts in years.
this was the fastest hour of my life, it is so nice seeing you guys together. it feels so natural. excited to see what the future holds for you guys
lunchtime with smosh and food taste test pls
i love how "i spent a day" and "try not to laugh" immediately made an episode with anthony and ian after smosh being independent news went out. so happy for you two!
Ayy lots of people were waiting for this. ❤
we love you
this is crazy I never thought this moment will happen but it happened. I remember watching smosh and you guys all day everyday and the video's would make my day better and better, especially when I had a bad day.
Oh, there he is
thanks youtube   now smosh is back
Let me tell you Anthony. Me and my best friend, lived SMOSH back around 2010 and 2011 when we were 13. I still remember the day he showed me food battle, and I seriously thought it was the funniest thing ever. Through out our later teenage years, we separated and weren't in contact as much as we used to, until four years ago, when we reconnected. Last night, he was over at my place and we were playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate, when we went for a cigarette break. His face in absolute shock, he turned his phone towards me, and showed the news that you two bought SMOSH. The two of us, now 25 years old, were beaming with excitement due to these news. You two have touched so many peoples hearts throughout all these years, and I can't tell how happy I am, that you two have reconnected. I wish best of luck to this new page of SMOSH. ❤
This is one of the most sincere, honest, respectful, understanding, loving, and joking around conversations between friends who have been through the ups and downs together I’ve ever seen. Love and thank you, to you both! It really helps, taking those life lessons to heart for those of us who are relating…but I’m also mostly looking forward to the future craziness and laughs, no matter what form they take ❤️
Can’t believe I’m watching this as a now 29 year old OG smosh fan. 🥺🥺🥺
This might be the fist membership I'm gonna get. I think Ian did great keeping smosh an amazing channel over the years but I also think having Anthony back will be absolutely mega.
So, there's no gonna be Food Battle 2023 :c
We should have known something was happening by the sudden contacts through Instagram that reappeared in the last bunch of months
Win
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no shit!!!, it is my later childhood
Omg I knew one direction would come back together!
i would love for the Food Battle IOS game back
Are we getting the shut up Smosh intro back?
celebrating by binging og smosh content
Dose this mean dady and dady are back to geather? Also Ian should get the bold cut again.
SEEING ANTHONY TEARING UP MAKES ME SO HAPPY FOR HIM!  KNOWING HE HAS FOUND HIS CLOSURE AND IS BUILDING HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH IAN AGAIN . . .  GETTING TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST IN AGAIN GIVES ME HOPE FOR THESE TWO AND FOR SMOSH!   THEY ARE PERFECT EXAMPLES OF FRIENDSHIPS THAT WILL ALWAYS FIND EACH OTHER ONCE MORE.  THEY ARE MY CHILDHOOD INSPIRATION AND I WILL SUPPORT IAN AND ANTHONY NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO WITH SMOSH!
That's just feels good
Ian seems so damn smart when communicating his frustrations after Anthony left smosh. Im so happy to see you guys being together again
I missed the Smosh thing and found Anthony separately, but this fills me with so much joy. Nothing beats old friends reconciling before our eyes!
Because we’re all just viewers all we can do is just be glad to see these two again, don’t try to control what you can’t
Yall know we can expect Food Battle 2023 right?!
I am so incredibly happy ♥️ I am 25 now, so Smosh was a big part of my childhood. And they kind of inspired me to get into a creative career. Started of with youtube skits and now I am a Experience Designer for BMW. Crazy to see them back together after so many years. Much love from germany ♥️
Is it possible to bring back some of the old members of smosh games sometimes? If freaking maricraft came back for the occasional episode with the old crew I probably would have a heart attack from pure elation    Anthony, Ian and freakin lasercorn and Joven and Mari and Sohinki and Wes omg
I stopped watching smosh about 6 months - 1 year before Anthony left, Makes sense now - there was no creative spirit left !
"If we burn it to the ground I'm happy to do that with you... let's burn this to the ground" I'M CRYING
i learned of you two owning smosh again through a short on the channel and was waiting for this video till i saw it. watched everything that has to do with anthony on smosh since the announcement and im so fuckin excited for everything thats to come.
When will food battle come back!!!
I’m just happy to see they are friends again. They had a really nice thing and I always thought fame money and adulthood just ruined it. So to see this it warms my heart. I’m happy for them
Such a beautiful thing to hear, you two are legends <3
Omg I've never joined a YT channel before but I am for you guys. You were my childhood and if you burn Smosh to the ground I'm going down with it
Ian seems like such a coolheaded logical guy hmm
i remember watching all of the episodes of ian is bored and all the food battles years and years ago, loving them so much, glad to see the boys reunite. This is big
I'm soooo happy
I just want you to know Anthony, that i ALWAYS thought that you were the funny one AND the hot one! ;3
Besides being beyond happy about this Smosh reunion, I am also thankful, because (while different scenarios, obviously,) I have been going through many similar situations with my career and friends in the same field (gaming industry) lately, and the retrospective (both positive and negative) but with the positive outcome based off of those experiences really resonated with me watching this today. Thank you both. And here’s to the future of both my own situation, but also, of course, Smosh. 🙂
Smosh being back with Ian and Anthony is amazing. But I definitely hope they are not just gonna make the old content again, you know? Like, it has to evolve with time. They can't keep making the same stuff they did when they were teens. I'm real excited about seeing them make new sketches that are more familiar to their current audiences as well. A childish joke here and there is great but I've always thought Smosh's best stuff hasn't been the "dickbiscuit" stuff but the things in between
smosh was a huge part of my childhood and the reason why i'm 100% fluent in english today (as a french person). seeing you both reunite and open up about the past and your experiences is so refreshing. defo looking forwards on what you'll do with smosh now
What is the milk fanfic?????????
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Tectonic moment. Been there since day 1. Thanks for coming back. We love you guys. Cheers  from a big fan from Brazil!
SMOSH IS BACK BABY
We need a food battle 2023
Every person needs time to figure out how they want to do things and that's okay. I think everything's gonna be fine for Smosh and I'm just happy to see this happening ❤🎉
You’ve created a blueprint for FaZe to follow, something tells me they won’t though
A moment for the history pages of YouTube! Congratulations guys!
I truly believed that we’ll never see them together in a video again so when I first saw the announcement on instagram I couldn’t believe it! I knew it wasn’t April but part of me for a sec thought what if this was April fools joke 😂 I’m so happy & excited to see what Ian & Anthony will bring to Smosh together!!!
This felt like a therapy session, it was so beautiful to watch!
Times are Truly Changing Now.
10:28 I was one of the kids who had a tiny allowance and preordered Smosh: The Movie 😄
The both of you had such a glow-up and I don't mean just style wise (amazing style, both of you. Love it!) but like, you're both such incredible people with great personalities and intellectual individuals!
An average smosh fan watching this from the moment Anthony dropped this to now, they had saw this video 6 times.
This is it. This is the one
Anthony was stuck in a toilet for 6 years. Wink wink 😉😉😉😉😜😜😜
smosh is back!?
Fuck dude I really miss my childhood best friend now
I am crying right now, oh my goodness. How many years has it been since we saw them together.
Great interview.
as a long time fan i see a lot of the old pride that you both had/have for this creation you made glad to see you guys reunite!!
Ians finishing words were so touching man.... A friend with that amount of patience and the same amount of faith in you like years before is something really special.  I'm so glad for both of you.
“Even if it doesnt do well, I know that this is the right thing- and if we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do that with you.”  I’m so happy these boys are back together. 🥹✨
Oh shiiit the bois are back togeather! ❤
When I first saw this I complained forgot that Anthony was a part of smosh hes changed so much since he left
Anyone else notice that at @56:32 he says rolf’ing?😂💀 lmao
it's mama and papa, they're back everybody
I PEED OUT OF EXCITEMENT
I see my entire childhood in these people. Hats off Ian and Anthony
Not me literally tearing up thinking about how Smosh as a whole has been on an upward spiral of slaying and I absolutely love all of the cast and crew and how each and every one of them is what makes Smosh Smosh and how the joy that this new chapter is opening is making y’all happy, Rhett and Link excited (how freaking sweet), and the fandom happy is just so amazing. Happiness all around. This is a HUGE 2023 slay moment. ❤
The crossover we needed
im FUCKING CRYIBNG
its been so long we've seen them together
I wanna hear more about their highschool days honestly
SMOSH TOGETHER AGAIN????
What I would give to be on the smosh cast. I'd move to LA right now lmao. (Currently New york)   Anthony's back babyyyy!!
Finally
Someone pinch me
Gotta love the "we still have the mojo" moment
i'm straight up mf grinning rn
They were like “hey see yur making bunch of money on yur own need a boss to grind yu down and make you feel worthless and replaceable? “   Imagine if you guys never shared your story YouTube would be so different!
i cried seeing this and finding out Smosh is back o.o you have no idea how much iv missed you two!!!
he.
CyberSpace celebrities LMAO
BURN IT TO THE GROUND BABY!!! 🔥🤘🏼
It makes me happy though that you guys are being real and having to speak out for certain things which is difficult for many creators and even people now, People like Shayne, Courtney, Damien, etc was people who also been working hard for this channel even from when they were background team in older smosh videos!  And see that all come together with the both of you guys with free will is the best thing you guys did, and dont feel pressured to overwork yourselves as we appreciate your content 🙏🏼
oh god the milk fanfic....
I feel like I’ve seen these two somewhere
OMG THE LEGENDS HAVE RETURNED!!?!!!!!
I first watched Smosh back in 2012-13 I was 11-12 and I remember watching Youtube on TV and what recommendation I got is Smosh vs Zombie it's very funny and ever since that day I subscribed to the channel and I watched the classics Smosh Games and Vlogs God typing this makes me feel old...and mind you guys that these guys are one of the legends of Youtube back them where there is no Copyright, No censorship (although there is little censorship) but still they went FULL ON....and yeah, love Smosh and love YouTube legends.... Edit: adding more to it the more to it when smosh got MORE cast back in 2015 let me say this it’s almost like YouTube SNL but except it’s almost everyday but yeah I am happy that those YouTube legends are here today doing as per YouTube guidelines (which sucks but they are still striving) so yeah that’s why I said love smosh and love YouTube legends
I remember watching the movie n I loved it
The boys are back 🥹
screaming and crying and screaming and crying 😭
A whole new generation of smosh begins now.
No way 12:00 to 24:00 Ian is a sellout, Ian was so gripped to the company he built, he stayed even when it was going against his values. Anthony had heart Anthony was firm on his beliefs. Ian doesn't have any balls. Wow
Smosh the movie ain’t bad. It’s alright.
HELL YEAH
Angry birds
the real question, what about food battle?
I'm so happy for you guys!!  I'm not generally into the type of comedy that gets demonetized, so I may not be Smosh fan material. But I'll check out the new stuff. And whether or not it's my thing, I'm happy to see renewed friendship, growth as humans and business people... It's exciting. :D
i remember how hard i cried when they broke up. i dont wanna sound cringy but they were a big part of my childhood and making me happy when no one could. this makes me so happy. thank you
"Bro, Smosh falling apart in the mid 2010s is a canon event"
if they weren't matched in a science project, smosh probably wouldn't exist
Ian's shirt looks like a tortilla
This was such a powerful, moving video. So happy for you guys!
First Anthony and Ian reunite to Smosh. Next will be Boxman Then Food Battle No, you can't wake me up. I'm dreaming.
Food battle 2023!
They HAD to do this otherwise AI would've done it first haha
Now Ian just needs to bring back the bowl cut
Hell yes! Food Battle 2023 babyyyyyyy!!!
OTHER DAD IS BACK!!!!!!
when i said i almost cried, i actually cried. Ian helding into the smosh after all the hardships man.. its inspiring.
This is what Faze needs to do.
Seeing the people I loved as a child, but the idea of those people being so far away, since I'm not a child anymore is disheartening a little bit.  But as an adult, seeing these two reconcile as adults. And wanting to continue in their direction now instead of what smosh was, brings me so much joy. And I wouldn't prefer it any other way.
i'm happy with this news...
There back
God, this is off topic but I love watching two men being emotionally articulate in a way that's new for their relationship. I love that they used this interview as a way to unpack a really difficult time for both of them, and really see it from the other's viewpoints. I love friendships!!
MEAL TIME WITH SMOSH HAS TO COME BACK!!!!
im one of those who enjoyed the movie enjoyed the game it was the golden time where you guys fulfilled that entertainment that i needed within me
It's so wonderful that you two are reconnecting.  And this is unrelated, but Ian looks like he's slowly turning into Steven Spielberg
Yes…you are are a different generation now.  You are almost middle aged men.
I feel like ya’ll are now giving yourself too much pressure to now it deliver us high expectation to hope for the old smosh returning to be amazing but as in right now no one really knows what’s going to happen
I'm just happy I kept following through with these 2 dudes ever since I was a little kid. i can't express my feelings with words
Two legends, man. And they are back 🍺
YouTube desperately needs a competitor sick and tired of them demonetizing creators I don't need a safe space they are making videos so bland creators fear doing anything.
If there's a YouTube rewind this year, this moment needs to be marked.
SHUT UP! I love you guys
I love you guys. I love that even though you guys went through all that crap. You both finally come together and own smosh again. Being able to talk about the tensions you both had that you never talked about with each other until now is just so inspiring and heartwarming. Being more honest with each other. Glad to see you and Ian together.
oh no... not the milk...
still waiting on foodbattle
Today is just the best timeline
This is just so fucking beautiful. 🥲
now kith
bro i am straight up not watching the full 73min man, but just let me tell yall, back in the day the lip sync vids... man these started the internet. that was literally the first internet stuff i consumed, before i got internet myself, getting the vids via a 256mb flashdrive. also: the fact that the transformers, pokemon, and like 5 others on that 256mb thing (it might have been way smaller actually lol) what i am trying to say, thanks guys, you two definitly wrote history, and since Fred isnt on yt anymore, its fair to say you guys are the CEOs of content creation
im so dead bro ians "i still wont" after anthony is like i counldnt show emotions. the dead pan ass stare into the abyss
This is so surreal for me. I grew up watching you guys and enjoying your videos and I was heartbroken when you guys went your separate ways, but I never stopped checking in on the both of you. Now I'm turning 19 and you've both come full circle and it's beautiful
This comeback - reunion is as exciting as the Jonas Brothers making music again :)
I feel like today has felt like if you didn’t know Christmas was even a holiday that was real, and all of the sudden Santa dropped it on you. 3 times. 3 videos. In one day. And he knew. 🙂
Greatest reunion ever
I'm excited for what smosh holds now that you guys have it back!
I replicated yalls Pokémon lip sync with my best friend. We don't talk anymore but maybe one day we will again ❤
wow, the murder-suicide at 1:12:06 was an amazing cap off. pure dedication by ian and anthony.    in all seriousness this was actually a great episode.
In reality, this shows that ian was immature about the situation when anthony was hurt/wanting to leave, but ian shouldve been more supportive of anthony leaving, but it seemed after their friendship was breaking, there wasnt much point for him to. But its good to see they both learnt from their mistakes. Anthony learnt a little more sooner then ian did.
who could have guessed that these two men, who were known for their silly lip-synch videos, would one day be responsible for one of the most beautiful videos ever put on the internet.
So happy to see two best friends together again 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻, amazing video Anthony and Ian ❤️❤️❤️
I can’t believe there’s actual people who don’t know what Smosh is😭
Biggest comeback of all time!!
I'm only 25 minutes in but it seems like Ian refuses to take accountability for some stuff and it's making me nervous about their new partnership😭😭
11:07
PROTECT GHETTO SMOSH PLEASE IAN ANTHONY
I’m so excited
this is healing such a large part of my inner child omfg
i really liked the smosh movie thought it was good
Dude, they’re bringing the band back together
God I feel so deeply emotional and excited about this, this is such a cool conversation to be able to listen to after the pure joy I felt after the first announcement that Anthony is back
Oh you bet the fanfictions are gonna start again, maybe less smut and more of a wholesome one.
man this was a great therapy session
My bday is next month, smooth coming back is the best bday gift ever
SMOSH:-SHUT UP come on its the best intro
we probably shouldn’t have been watching you guys back then, but i’m glad i did, no one else was able to get me as excited as you guys did every friday in 5th grade, coming back home eager to see the next video , i turn 20 in 2 weeks , thank you for the decade full of smiles and laughs 😂
Man I love these two! Specially the hot one. Anthony is kinda nice too I guess...
the way ian said he was fine with burning it down because he is doing it with you is the sweetest fucking thing it got me in tears. im so excited to see where this all goes!
Seeing Anthony weep whilst Ian said 'I won't' when talking about showing emotions is heartbreaking. Ian is hurting too, but he can't show it. He needs to be strong and for those of us that need to hide our emotions, to hold it together, show a stiff upper lip because to break down is to show weakness and he's doing it to protect the staff in his employment... It's really hard to watch and I hope Ian can make peace with how he truly feels
I love how this episode is less of an interview and more of a conversation between two friends
my childhood 🖤
I'm so happy to see Ian and Anthony get together again and recreate the original smosh, but this whole interview made me realize I need therapy.  My friends probably need it to.  I never take self-care days for myself or openly communicate with my close friends because we all feel the need to hold onto barriers and "do things on our own" because other people do it too.  We were always those guys that were like "I don't need therapy, I'll be fine" but after hearing Ian and Anthony finally talk openly on Youtube after a decade, and hearing Ian talk about finally giving in to therapy, it makes me want to give it a shot too.
Smosh coming back and the world's healing memes are hilarious and it does feel good to see. I also appreciate the conversation about adult friendship and how, while it is okay to let things go, it is a shame to let such a connection never return. I wish the best for you two in most the business side and especially on a personal level.   everyone, remember to work on yourself bc you never realize how it is affecting your relationship with others!

Aw yay this makes me so happy to see. They were such a big part of my childhood tbh. And it’s grassy to see both of them on their separate journeys just falling back into place. It’s nice to see. And I’m here for whatever they do next.
i freaked out when i saw this
I'm really surprised that Anthony returned to owning Smosh after leaving Smosh years ago. I'm no longer watching Smosh because of how they treated the original crew at Smosh Games and because of the actions of Matt Raub.
it happened
Don't burn yourselves out or pressure yourselves, guys! We're just stoked that the OGs are back! Even just 1 video a month would be awesome as long as you don't tire yourselves out. Excited for the new sketch!🥳
“THANKS FOR BREAKING HER YOU DICK BISCUIT” - Anthony 2012
This is so wholesome and I feel like it was much needed for the both of you. The relief and the spark here was so apparent. So happy for you guys man pop the fu## off 😭❤
Im so happy that you guys are getting back tog we her for Smosh! Can’t wait to see what you do in the future.
i'm sorry Anthony but your return is completely overshadowed by Ian's Mom
Ian really held on to Smosh long enough for Anthony to come back. I can’t wait for the new era of Smosh.
This really is just one of the most important canon events on the internet.
Oh wow I have to subscribe to smosh again
My childhood is coming back thank you
i honestly feel for Ian. i can just imagine being so desperate to keep something afloat and then the second half of it just running away and abandoning it. i know it's already done and they are both cool now but i can totally understand Ian and his frustrations in the past. they both had it hard of course. i also feel like Ian matured a lot differently from Anthony, i'm honestly surprised they decided to go through the decision to buy Smosh together. maybe it's just the way he comes off on camera but Ian feels a lot more distant and realistic
I don’t know.  I think Ian should be the sole owner of SMOSH. The staff and people he has brought in and the skits..TNTL, eat or yeet it, Reddit convos…this is what we want to see. It is funny and light.
To me, the initial company that bought Smosh going bankrupt showed a glimpse of what Smosh used to be in the form of that make a wish parody video. I laughed at that shit sooooo hard. I’m so glad these two are finally back at it together to try to bring back what Smosh used to be.
It's must've been really hard for them. They're really opening up
This is the most Meta Interview that Anthony has ever made, after he had interviewed almost everyone, he interviews to the one and only Ian, the one where they all started their careers as youtubers, just at the same time where they bring Smosh back aswell during the interview, this is so cool
Why does Ian look so good here? The heck.
that damn painting keeps staring into my soul
My childhood has been restored
Damn this was surreal. Ive drifted apart from freinds before and it really sucks, and i cant imagine what it wouldve beeb like for you two. So glad this is happening and excited to see where it goes
It legitimately makes me feel like a middle aged woman who's favorite boy band in highschool is getting back together for a legacy tour.  I missed you guys.  I was 15 the last time smosh was REALLY smosh.
Wait what?! You own Smosh again?!
Absolutely need Lunchtime with Smosh back. I would love a few of those sprinkled in from time to time. I think it was a great way to interact with fans.
You know what Anthony, I could see Ian slowly losing his light his vibrance since u left. Like how a candle slowly burn out. He was becoming more serious-er and quiet-er. His goofy fun side was fading. U two together shine bright. I love it that u guys are back. Im so happy.
This is the greatest story to come out of YouTube. This seriously is the most wholesome and heartwarming thing ever. Thus is the stuff they make movies about. Welcome back to amosh Anthony, you were dearly missed.
Decided to buy the membership for Smosh and this channel aswell to celebrate you guys getting back Smosh's ownership❤ I'm so excited to see what y'all have planned in the future :D <3
Awesome!!
I remember asking my dad what condoms are,  because they had a behind the scenes vid called "playing with condoms" or something like that, and told me not to watch them anymore.. of course I didn't listen hHAHAHAHAHA
the moment we’ve all been waiting for 🥹💖
Childhood.  That's all that needs to be said.
I love how much you guys reflected on your friendship and your feelings about all this, you've both really grown and matured and that's great to see. ❤
this means so much to me to be able to listen to and see yall actually talk about what yall went thru. 1million/10 good job boys :*)
The original “we should start a podcast together”
I am so fricking happy right now.
This is so nice
I watched them when I was 13-15, deff not for kids but for early teen years 😛
Cannot express how excited I am for this new Ara ❤❤
You both were just kids yourself... all the mistakes I made in 20s oh lord I can't begin. All my regrets are from my 20s. Fact is you had to make those mistakes so you can be where you are today. Mentally and physically. Stronger, more Prepared, and Ready as fuck!
Rest in peace, Smosh. Anthony and Ian are barely famous now.
Better than any Smosh film
I realised i’m old when I wondered if they’d been out to dinner together and before eating one of them would’ve shouted ‘FIRST BITE!!’ at the other and now I realise how deeply ingrained the smosh lore is in my brain.
gosh, this was such a beautiful rekindling of your friendship and made me super nostalgic
Smosh, Nigahiga, Pewdiepie, Dizastamusic... Happiest years of my life.
watching this and listening to you two talk about everything that has happened is something I really needed. It feels like knowing what happened between you two and how you got to where you are now really fills in a lot of holes and answers questions a lot of smosh fans had. And hearing you talk about how well writing sketches together went and all the ideas makes me so hyped to see what happens with Smosh now.
everything has come full circle]
Watching Smosh from the OG to Smosh Crew, Defy era and Post anthony just to come back full circle is amazing. Props for Ian continuing the smosh family all those years. A true blessing.
Here4Milk
I just binged ur episodes yesterdayhoping for a collab
Let's take a moment to appreciate how this whole conversation is setting such a great example to younger and older fans of smosh - and especially men, because they didn't get role models for this until recently/or weren't allowed to  - to just talk about your feelings, being open and showing your emotions. It's so healthy. I love this.
I think it's time to bring Ryan Higa on the show, the era when you guys were ruling Youtube was gold
thank you for being honest. i always feel both of them to be very organic about the stuff they put out. that's why it's not always a hit but you can sense their effort.
I don't know why but the line, "If we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you" touched me so much and nearly made me cry. It's not even my friendship  😭
I'm still missing my man Charlie the drunk guinea pig :'(
I’m actually crying. I stopped watching smosh after they left, i’ve missed them so much and I hoped that one day… I’m actually crying right now. this is my childhood, i’m actually so emotional right now
Kudos to Rhett and Link!!! They played SUCH a big role in this whole thing
Reboot Oishi highschool battle
IAN!
Molestor moon is still up 🌚🌚🌚
This is really refreshing to watch
We need a "spent a day with Ian's mom" 😢
waiting for “I SPENT a DAY with ANTHONY PADILLA”
Yesterday’s video and tweet sent me jumping for joy, bouncing on my bed, kicking my feet in the air. I never expected any of this to happen and its just all so emotional. Im kicking down everyones door showing them this grand piece of news. This day will go down in YouTube History.
The best message from this episode: Let go of the past and move on. The healthiest thing to do in 99% of life.
It feels like I watched a movie where a high school garage band broke up and it time skipped to when the band mates were all being adults and the super rich successful member got everyone together to reform the band.
SMOSH IS BACK!!!
Fantastic. This is fantastic
I love you guys ❤
HISTORY IN THE MAKING
Now kith
"Wow this Vsauce episode was really good I don't see him topping it any time soo... oh"
I love this.  It's not an interview like most of the other video.  It's a discussion, talk about everything we have wanted to know. How things have been between them since Anthony left and even before.  It's what we all needed.
<3
I never was a fan of Smosh, but just seeing two old friends reconnecting is very moving.
I feel like the internet NEEDS Smosh right now, it's so heart-warming to see you come back together. I'm so excited to see what the future brings for you.
At last.
The cyberspace celebrities are back
Cool for you to dropped this after i finished unsubbing 💀
Whoa you have great chemistry with this little know star y’all should do like a sketch group together or something
I am so incredibly happy that this happened and also Ian's "I'm so happy to burn this thing down with you" made me cry a lil tear I-
i need to know where the creator of the milk fic is today
I literally grew up watching Smosh and I am so glad that they managed to get Smosh back, and is in the process of repairing their friendship. Gotta thank Rhett and Link for their support on holding onto Smosh for them. Looking forward to the new contents that you guys will create together!
To me it looks like Anthony is expressing his emotions and looking grateful more while Ian seems relieved and like a lot is coming off of his shoulders
1:11:36 IMMA CRY
I’m chuffed for you but mainly I’m still pushing for that New York donut party that was promised in 2013 🤌
Man 😭😭😭😭😭❤️
I remember when I first watched Smosh and it was just funny and it felt like the humor (at the time) just got you. It is DEFINITELY a product of its time (which in this case is not fully a bad thing imo) but there was a lot of it that was funny cause it understood what a dumbass teenager on the internet would find funny and it was great. As I grew older I fell out of watching Smosh, I think it was right around the buy out, Im pretty sure at least. I remember feeling like that charm was gone and they weren't funny anymore. Now they were just another cash grab YouTube channel that felt super safe. I remember hearing about the buy out years later and having that context really explained a lot. I remember when Anthony left, I thought Smosh was gonna end, I thought that era was just over and ran its course. So its crazy after all of that hell that both Anthony and Ian went through that NOW they can be free to make what they want again. Its no longer advertiser safe, just dumb fun and whatever they feel they want it to be. Honestly while I'm not into that kind of content anymore, I am EXTREMELY curious where its going and I wanna support it where I can. I'm glad you guys got this freedom again, it just sucks that it had to happen in such a fucky way.
Return of the kings👑👑🔥
This is not what i was expecting to wake up to this morning. I really hope the two of them can get back to being good friends again, its one thing for anthony to be a co-owner again, but as long as its something that actually makes him happy, and not a business decision based on the desperation of fans
If you guys end up making one last food battle that would truly make the journey complete
It must have been so hard for them in the past, and I'm so glad they've learned, grown, and most importantly, are able to have their core friendship bond again with no walls. Friendship and having a magical spark with someone is so special. Anthony tearing up made me cry too.
Honestly, Ian and Anthony are looking way better than they did when Defy owned them. I'm surprised it didn't take a physical toll appearance-wise
I remember getting on the family computer and watched  Pokemon in real life for the first time, man that brings back memories. I remember asking my friends in elementary if they saw the newest smosh videos.
greatest moment in youtube history
It feels surreal to see Ian and Anthony grown up from the days of the emo hair and bowl cut.
About time lads😉
Such great memories watching Smosh as a kid all these years ago!
so the long and short is that corporate America fucked with my childhood boys? goddamn that shit. anyway I am excited to come back to watch the smosh that I was missing for years
Milky milkshake (Milky milkshake) Milky milkshake Dancing with my milkshake, baby, oh, yeah I'm dancing with my milkshake Oh, I love my milky, milky shake baby
The world is healing, I never would've thought this reunion will happen in my lifetime
I think it would be so cool to see the reactions of some of the OGs who are at Smosh now react to knowing Anthony is coming back, like shayne and Courtney, Olivia, Keith, Noah, and Damien people who worked with Anthony when he was there
Make sure we get a SHUT UP intro
I’m so excited to see what Ian and Anthony can do together with the reclamation of Smosh. I’ll always love and remember the old Smosh, but those days are gone. I’m really looking forward to seeing something entirely new.  I’ve been a fan since the early days. I’ve watched Smosh blow up, I’ve grown to love the cast, I’ve watched Anthony become his own creator, and I’ve stuck through it all.
I'm happy the thumbnail style is back, because the purple box style is awful, I would scroll the recommendation away not knowing it was Anthony's videos.
Discovered Anthonys channel a few days ago and now this (from being a fan of smosh when I was a kid). Woho
Pokémon in real life was the first youtube video I ever watched.
already a member gang
Ian Anthony (GOD IT FEELS SO GOOD SAYING THESE NAMES TOGETHER)  I LOVE YOU GUYS. Dyu know you both are my btothers?
If Smosh can become together again I believe we will see our Queen Jenna Marbles upload again
anthony nothing without smosh? SMOSH IS NOTHING WITHOUT ANTHONY to me always has been
Wow it’s crazy Ian and Anthony finally made a video for the first time everybody has wanted it
I really loved smosh when I was younger and it still holds a special place in my heart, love you dudes😌
Its crazy because we thought they were fine when Smosh was at its peak since they both look happy in all the vids but in the end it cost their real friendship. I'm glad both Anthony and Ian finally are back together
I’m turning 30 this year. This is THE BEST fucking present I could ask for. Me and my friends were obsessed with your content and even made our own shitter versions of your videos in school so this brings back all the memories! I’m so happy this is happening man
im so glad you two reunited its so Heart-Warming
im so glad u guys were so open about this, you’ve both been through a lot and im so happy you guys came back together. im excited for you guys and ur  new era!!
Don't forget to appreciate the legends Link & Rhett
I really flashed back to being in middle school and rating the Pokémon cover 5 stars. I'm so happy to see y'all together again
I'm happy that you were able to reconnect and rekindle your relationship ❤
beautiful.
The my best friend is still here comment had me sobbing i love you guys
Greatest moment in Internet History
But the most important question: does the "SHUT UP!" intro also makes a comeback?
letsss go
YESSSSSSS I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS
“I know that there are people that did enjoy the movie” guys it’s me, I enjoyed it so much 💀
Smosh really did became like a big corporation thing and just gave in to the money but now they own it let's hope it's in good hands because I had a lot of good memories growing up with it
I am so glad that this is happening! Thanks you guys, I am so happy to see this
I still love that Anthony became the oprah of youtube
chkchkhkch SPSHHH SHUT. UP.
I watched till the end. Didn’t skip to the key points of the video. This was inspirational. This is the best grown up  video on YouTube. Besides some other mature things but this feels like the video we have been waiting for years. I totally understood years ago and now even more that Anthony was right and was entitled to leave Smosh to live a happy life until he felt ready to come back to Smosh. Plus, it’s good that he outsourced his ideas to this channel and allowed us to see a whole new perspective of him and how fun he can still be even if he isn’t on Smosh. His whole identity doesn’t reflect only on Smosh but those other features matter. Love you guys. Keep making this type of content and bring back the old Smosh videos. Don’t worry, we will fight for you if you get demonetized or banned. Long live Anthony and Ian from Smosh. You guys are the best 😊😊
PLEASE Why have I been thinking so much about the Ianthony ship recently, only for them to annouce coming back together and making jokes about the ship and fanfiction. The coincidence is insane 😂
Always wondered when Anthony would interview Ian on his channel. With Smosh coming back, this is pretty appropriate!~  😁
The whole story of SMOSH could be a movie in itself. I'm so happy for you two 💖
This supposed to be a movie.
Bring back the star rating program/system.
30:04 honestly deserved
17 years. Both my age, and the age of their journey.
i'm not crying you're crying i never thought this day would come
Dang it! Smosh summer games was on my bingo card for this year but not Ian & Anthony buying smosh back!
reminds me of the avengers and doctor strange saying there was only one way.
Im gagging and I haven’t even finished watching it 😭😭❤️
andy tthings are a fandom of mine... but i'm a weirdo with chill
First video i watched from smosh is that walking pass pokemon NPC thingy like 12or13years ago Then it gradually it became daily routine to eat lunch w/ lunch time with smosh/mail time  You guys grew to be such a fine gentlemen now. Im glad we the viewer have an opportunity to grow with you guys. Goodluck on the future!
😍
free ghetto smosh!
OG SMOSH IS BACK!! YES!! We can't wait for the next sketch comedy episode starring Ian and Anthony!
other way to finance sketches is end of video sponsors, like daniel trasher or ryan george
It took me watching this video to believe that this actually  happened. I was like 13 years old when i was watching smosh videos. This is great news!
It's so endearing to see these guys talk openly about their thoughts and feelings at the time, with the new maturity and emotional intelligence they have gained over the years
the best duo from the internet is back!!!! miss those days when waiting for smosh vid
i quite literally grew up with smosh, i am SO excited to see what you guys are gonna do together again :)
We've been waiting a long time for this one
I'm so happy man, we got this channel and smosh being owned by you and anthony as well as ian mom and the classic vibes returning 😭😭 And YES Ian is finally interviewed by you, from now this is gonna be the best thing ever happened in youtube history ⭐️⭐️⭐️
padilla i did my life bc of you
when Anthony started giving credit to Mykie for helping him grow and process his emotions I cried bruh wtf :( their relationship is so <3   I missed these two together I grew up with Youtube and these two were at the forefront of it all that started this Youtuber lifestyle this made me so happy and proud of them! Congratulations on being able to buy and fully owning Smosh!! Looking forward to your guys' videos on there!
Wow, can't believe they finally found Ian
mori episode? 22:45
Come back to Sactown!
Rhett and link are just amazing love them for just being helpful and just amazingly supportive
FINALLY
Yo i didnt even know Rhett & Link bought SMOSH to keep it going, i'm sobbing. How great! And even greater, SMOSH is back where it belongs now 🥺❤ This video and news hit us deep in the feels.
In 20 years there will be a Smosh bio pic. It’ll probably get everything wrong and miss the point but I’d go see it.
WOW... "I did not think this was going to happen." Omg brother did I...
Take a shot every time Ian says "like"
I'm so happy to see this! Been with you both since I was a kid (and now I'm damn near thirty please help me) and I'm excited for this new era! Welcome back Smosh!    Now buy back the smosh house!  (Jk) (Unless...)
40SECONDS AND ITS ALREADY GOLD ALSO IF THERE ARE ANY PRIVATED VIDEOS PLEASE UNLIST AND SHARE IM JOINING
Haven’t watched this show in ages but this is a must
This was 6 hours ago and this was everything I was waiting for
Ian's point at 45:06 is right on the money about friendships in adulthood as we all mature, I feel that personally in my case. My best friend and I met at college and about 2yrs into our friendship we went through an extremely rough patch for an extended amount of time thanks to drama and trauma. We had to let go of that and take space for a while before we naturally reconnected and eventually talked through everything. Now we've been thick as thieves like never before. You can't force things in life and I've had to learn that time and time again, and hell, I'm only in my 20s. I've lost and regained relationships in my life and have learned that sometimes time and space will heal those wounds and bring reconciliation, and if it doesn't, it will bring peace of mind from letting go. Very important stuff
Missed seeing you guys together
🖤🖤
Congratulations !! 🎉❤
LETS GO
MY HEART I AINT EVEN STARTED THIS EPISODE ITS HAPPY
Oh my god, its been such a long time that i forgot they where smosh together. Completely forgot their history until they hugged
Besties ❤❤❤❤
1:11:37 Man the fanfics are going to have a field day
i LOVED the smosh movie
These two have good chemistry. They should start a youtube channel together.
I am one of those person who enjoyed Smosh the movie XD
this genuinely got me tearing up to see how much these 2 have grown over the years, i look foward to the future of smosh
Ian's shirt looks like how cheese melts on the perfect pizza 🤯
As someone who was only about 5 years younger than Smosh when it first came out and grew up through middle school and highschool, before falling out from it; this makes me so genuinely happy to see. I'm so happy for them. TTuTT
i remember watching smosh daily during the 2010's era.. amazing time period.. miss it, glad yall back 💖💖😭😭
Can I just say., that person who now has the assassins creed’s outfit is the most luckiest person ever
Seeing Anthony and Ian together again is absolutely wild and amazing. Smosh was a huge part in many peoples lives so when Anthony left the future seemed uncertain for both, how little we knew (thanks a lot Defy. NOT!)
holy szhittgerino
Seeing Anthony so hyped about this is awesome
This makes me feel like if John and Paul publicly got back together. I’m so happy right now this is insane
I was with smosh since 2008 and seeing these two back together is honestly so huge it felt like pure whiplash since its something I never thought would ever happen again. Its so surreal seeing these two in the same room together again after so long and it almost brought me to tears.
i swear to god, i had a dream a few months ago where Ian was being interviewed by someone and i didnt know who it was but now it has been revealed to be Anthony. I love that they actually reunited together on Smosh
take a shot every time they say smosh
The Return of the Kings!
Never thought this would happen. I remember watching the mortal kombat video on MTV  back in 2006 and being amazed since then , congrats!
i basically grew up with smosh, and i was devastated to see anthony leave. but after watching his videos i got why and understood. the smosh without him was still great but never the same. i started watching anthonys own content and i liked it, it was really good. this is a kindof loose story sorry, but seeing the two people from smosh i grew up with reconnect and going back to smosh together, is just surreal and amazing. ik the two whole dollary doos isnt alot but yea
Genuinely heartwarming.
All is right in the world now, peace has returned. The comedy kings are back and my childhood has been returned to me. Thank you. I needed this so bad.
I see you guys since the MySpace era. The era where i was in the emo/scene phase. Which were the happiest years of my life. I loved your videos. You brought so much positivity with your humour.  Life really was a lot better back than. People welcomed creativity. Thank you.
Your relationship needed as close to a factory reset as human relationships can get.
I remember seeing Anthony leaving smosh back when i was still in my early teens, i never really understood why Ian always said "it had to happen" I always thought Ian was the "bad guy" cause in my mind Anthony was forced to quit. But now as I've grown up, experienced my fair share of struggles and better understood the inner workings of life. I finally understand why "it had to happen" and this collab that i never expected in a million years just confirms it
Aww man! its enough to make a grown man cry... :')
idk why, but Anthony using "rofling" casually in a sentence harmed me in a way
This feels like when all the boy meets world characters came back for girl meets world
This feels like a cannon event 😂
Ian is so bad at vocally expressing his feelings and emotions on camera(understandable) but you can see it in his face, his body language and the way hes speaking. The emotions are all there and its adorable 🤣😭 we love a shy king haha
Oh there is Anthony
NOT THE MILK FIC
You are both very smart and happily grown and in the process of healing. Lovely to see😊 Your humor is equally bizarre so no one could ever peg a "funny one". Have no fear lol
Holy fuuuuuuck
Where is Anthony??
Does any one else have a huge smile on their face or is it only me
Ur crying, I’m not…….man😢😢😢😢im so fucking happy to see both of them on the same screen again
Is there other youtubers beside Smosh and NigaHiga who started Youtube by Lip syncing????
Finally you guys appear again on youtube, my childhood
this feels like a modern version of that old smosh video they made YEARS ago, does anyone remember when they made "Reunited"? with Teabag and Fwong???😂
What’s gonna happen to the other cast? Shane Courtney Keith Olivia and Noa? I don’t want them to go away either
Gods real
FOOD BATTLE 2024
I really miss the food battles. I look forward to seeing you two help all your fans in such a massive way.
Best thing that happened in 2023
PLEASE MAKE PART-TIMERS SEASON 3 I BEG YOU GUYS
Smosh mail time was always fun to watch from these two!
These 2 created some of my favorite childhood memories.
Did you guys have sex yet?
Okay but can we ALSO get a if movies were real 10😂
I’m sure they figured this out a long time ago but, I hope they realize the fans they made making dumb videos grew up and are around the same age they are now. We all grew up together utilizing the same technological advancements and having a singular experience. I hope they move forward just staying true to themselves and making content they feel is good or deem to be entertaining & more importantly, ENJOY MAKING
I can't believe I was there for the beginning of Smosh and now you have it back! Way back when I got a friend one of your Shredder T-shirts for her 16th ( I think?) birthday and when placing the order asked you to write a birthday message for her AND YOU DID! That was so cool. Also shipping from the US to Germany was so much easier back then. Now customs is such a nightmare that I don't order anything from the US anymore ;-;
I love this. The journeys. 🫶🏼🫶🏼
This is amazing. Even if I find out I have outgrown this I'll still check it out. I'm so happy for you guys. Gonna have to resub to smosh again
The announcement was a shock, now I come home to see this uploaded? Bro is Smosh making a comeback?!
I'm exited for this new beginning🤩🤩
Very heartwarming and very real talk. I'm sure this was hard for you guys. I knoe it was with my best friend. I love you both thanks you for such a positive impact and your sacrifices. 😊
Food battle 2023?
Great!
29:46 😭🤣🤣🤣
This feels like meeting an old childhood friend that had to leave town because his parents had to work elsewhere. Honestly describes their whole situation anyway. Corporates brings in money, but to remove that freedom and friendship is not worth it. I'm happy these guys are back together, they've been a heavy part of most kids growing up at the start of the 2000s
refused mentioned 😳 now get dennis lyxzen in the show
I grew up with you guys and watched all your videos when i was younger and it devastated me when u left Anthony but at the time I didn't understand why you left but I never hated you for it and im glad you got to were you are alone and proved to youre self u can do it. I'm so glad I got to see you guys get closer again and require Smosh congratulations
So glad ur back to ghater i did kind of groe up whit smosh at one point when i was like 14 15 i never realy stopt watching ur funny vidios i eaven did go back and watch the old Stuff
Im gonna cry
Dude the past day with these two has been like a massive mind fuck. I saw the we bought smosh video after I got out of work yesterday and now watching this going into work today just adds to the trippiness. Really crazy stuff but beautiful at the same time
I definitely liked the smosh movie it was hilarious Even if it wasn't really that good still funny.
i remember people are shytting on anthony for leaving smosh being negative, well guess what, anthony was right bout it.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS, YES. i've loved smosh for  over 9 years and it's crazy to see them talk about the history of the channel
God damn my childhood
I have been waiting to finally see the title on Anthony Padilla's video "I spent a day with Ian Hecox" and the memories are accumulating again...
frick yeah love these dudes (no homo)
Not me holding back tears.. because smosh literally my childhood, when i first learn English, like this guys literally part of my English dictionary 😂😂
Also, Ian's real sense of humor is back. Love it XD
Rhtt and Link are no longer the big daddies of SMOSH, it's now Anthony and Ian! Again technically!
Nature... is healing...
my favorite moments here: "that was when I realized, _oh shit!_ fuck I'm gonna cry a little bit- _my childhoodfriend that I grew up with is still here._ " 41:44  "we started writing and pretty quickly I was noticing-- we were like, *_laughing._* " 56:20  "I truly think this is the biggest thing that I've ever done, and I am *so* scared. But I know that this is the way." "It's going to go well... and even if it doesn't-" "Look, and this is the thing. Even if it doesn't do well, I know that this is the right thing and, if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you." 1:10:59
The kings of the internet have returned, but rhett and link are always so nice and its amazing to see how happy they were about you guys buying smosh again, always knew they were the cool dads of thre internet
I need to thank you guys for keeping me entertained like no one ever else did. I hated the day Anthony left but always hoped for this day to come. You guys were really entertaining people and I'm hopeful for a bright future!
Congrats I’m excited for your guys future endeavors
Will food battle 2017 finally be released?😂
Yipeeeeeeeeeeeeee🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Smosh was legit my childhood, back in elementary school my friend and I were hop on the ancient mac my family had and would sit on YouTube for hours watching the beginning of the internet really, great times
Do Andrew Tate and supersize him with a pink frosted sprinkled donut :)
Omg I'm so happy for all of yous 😭😭
41:58 wtf
this whole thing is just so amazing. i especially loved how you both talked about rekindling your friendship, and i’m sure im not the only adult who can relate. realizing that your best friends are still there is the one of the most heart warming experiences. as a long time smosh fan, i am so excited to see you guys together again and so SO excited for the future of smosh❤❤❤
Can we just get another food war
Anthony leaving Smosh was a Canon event 33:50
you guys have quite literally shaped my childhood so learning that both of you reunited to create content together brought so so much happiness to my life. thank you so much and i’m wishing for all the success that you guys can get in this new chapter of your lives❤️
So this is Smosh BTS?    Either way, I'm happy for you guys to be back together?
My biggest question after the announcement was “what happens to this channel?” Because we were reassured that Smosh’s other channels would be left alone without mention of this one. This interview had a brief mention that this fulfills a certain role in Anthony’s life, so that means we get “I spent a day with…” AND Smosh??? That’s perfection.
im subscribing to smosh again. Cant wait !
god, smosh has their own version of the Ryden milk fic...
This is the best thing ever to happen
44:54
I wanna give props to Rhett and Link. It was actually nice knowing that they were supportive about the 2 of you. They understand what smosh is and its not just business for them. They gave a hand when times were rough, and now that both of you are ready, it there waiting for you.
❤❤
I think what im realizing zoning out & of course looking from the outside in on their situation is. Anthony has always been the more Emotional Person & Ian has always been the more Intellectual.    It doesn't mean that Anthony isn't a deep thinker or Ian doesn't have emotions but as they grew it was clear that someone like Anthony who feels things so strongly & craves a sense of Freedom could not thrive in an environment where his creativity was being challenged/stifled/judged etc.  And Ian was able to push past or overlook Anthonys concerns/struggles because it simply wasn't as important to him at the time as keeping the momentum he thought he had in his career going. Plus as he said he still had some deeply set fears of letting go of something thats working (even if things were drastically changing from the beginning of Smosh)  I can see why they drifted apart honestly, & even though Smosh wasn't a huge part of my childhood like others im genuinely happy they got the chance to be open and say these things/reconnect.  Hopefully in the privacy of their own lives they can continue to have deeper talks and enjoy things as the adults they've grown into while remaining healthily reminiscent of "The good ol days" 🤗❤🧡💛💚💙💜💖
lmao anthony be GIGGLING
I'm joking of course but they should have saved this comeback to reveal it during the Nintendo direct 😂
This is the Mordecai (Anthony) and Rigby (Ian) of Smosh
Lunch time with smosh
The youtube legends lesss gooo
Regarding the card, this is so important. That's alwo how I made one of my best friends in high school. She was a shy girl and we had barely interacted, but on my birthday she gave me a little card that she had crafted herself with a kind message, saying that she was glad that we had met. That's when I properly noticed her for the first time. It was such a kind thing. And we've been friends ever since
i really hope, old smosh gaming crew (mari and the gang) come back
all grown up 😢
Best friends stay forever, even things go rough and both get separated due to life changes. In the end, we longing for the person who were our best friend, talk to each other for long time and get back together again. Ian and Anthony are such a beautiful persons and both are amazing. I wish for the best of you two! Long live Smosh!
It’s interesting seeing them together and dancing around some difficulties they had. Anthony behaved selfishly and his ego wasn’t being fed. Ian was a bit more level-headed but his surprisingly calculated personality further pushed Anthony away. The point Ian made that they’d drift apart during their 20’s hits the nail on the head. Seeing them come full circle is very nice and I think they’re finally at a point where they have mutual understanding and respect, despite their incompatibility. Kind of like deciding to stay for the kids. Nice to see them together again. And well done on finishing the story and facing each other. Good luck to them both.
was there a smosh version of the ryden milk fic ????? i guess i shouldnt be surprised
O-Fucking-Gs.
This feels like more of a podcast then an interview but I'm all here for it
“If we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do that with you”🥹❤️
This is huge ❤
the more things change the more they stay the same
Two bros talking about their past issues and feelings, what a sight to behold
YO I CANT BELIEVE IM ONLY 6HOUR LATE AND NOT WEEKS OR MONTHS OR MAYBE YEAR.. CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED JUST NOW!!
People don’t realize they’ve still been friends after all this time, but this is the day they are finally collaborators again. It’s been so long and I’m so happy they’re back together making content!
You know Markiplier, PewDiePie, Ryan Higa, Jacksepticeye, and all the OG greats will watch this video
currently went through this right now i get alil hope when you said when yoou started to let go it all fell back into place maybe i still can make things right with EVERYONE in my past idk if im taking this wrong but  nah imma do my thing
I love how this channels video is primarily support for ian, and the tntl is support for anthony. Even them point blank saying they arent best buds.. i feel like a majority who watch 1 channel or the other missed the dynamic of these 2 together that "we" support the other half missing more in this moment.
It would be cool to see some cameos from old skits and some characters returning, not necessarily exactly the same but even has like an older/developed character fitted to the more modern/newer style yall come up with
Idk why, but I didn't enjoy all of Ian's energy in this. I love 98% of this but sometimes it feels like he's brushing off how Anthony felt. When Anthony was expressing his devastation and pain over the changes, the energy i got from Ian kinda just felt like him saying "its a business bro, ur fault for getting attached" annoys me
i do love this change and its awesome to see them wanting to try again. i hope the sketch comedy can still involve the other cast though. everyone deserves some screen time
i was getting emotional and it got ruined by a fckin uber eats ad lmao
I am so goddamn happy right now
Im 35 right now pretty much grew up with Smosh from the start the whole rise of Youtube and all that and it's so amazing to see these 2 in the same shot again just feels nostalgic by now. 41:50 felt really emotional you can see Anthony really going back to what it was to be friends with Ian and made him tear up I think that was really heartwarming.   Keep the awesome videos up Anthony I love what you do with this channel
FINALLY!
welp the wattpad servers are going to melt after this announcement
Anthony passed away too soon, so i'm happy he's alive again in the Smosh-verse...
My inner child is now healed
Bought a membership for Smosh's main channel. Can't believe you two are back together and creating again!
I really wanna hear what @psychogyinseattle has to say. Probably good things?
You know I never appreciated the fact that these guys that were a big part of my childhood are still around providing entertainment for me. Seeing Ian in the smosh videos has kind of made me taken him for granted and I forgot what a pioneer and legend he is in the YouTube sphere.    So glad this video came out man glad to see you two back at it
It's great seeing these two together again.
I remember finishing 6th grade when Anthony left and I was so upset over it.  I just graduated highschool, this is amazing ❤
FINALLY 😆 SMOSH is BACK! YEAH! thanks to Rhet & Link, Mythical crew, and especially ms. Diana
I feel like I've learned a lot about myself and my friendships from this episode. I really appreciate you both sitting down and reflecting, laughing, and being vulnerable with one another. I feel like this video was more than just being about the return of Smosh. So much more.
Bro it's great to see them together again Smosh was my childhood
The World is healing
Honestly, really glad that Anthony left, if he didn't, Smosh would've definitely died. I'm glad that they split, focused on their own identity, and then came back together again
This is fascinating, and really brave of you guys to make public.
Congratulations guys!!!!!!
Aw... This is just healing and hopeful to watch!!!  Glad that you shared this moment!
So happy for y'all. Thanks for letting us see you both grow. 🥰
Food fight 2023 when?
Ian and Anthony together again in a video? Ian and Anthony owning Smosh again? Ian and Anthony creating videos together for Smosh again?!? I thought this day would never happen! I'm so happy :') It was very nice to know more about what happened when you left Smosh and how Ian felt (I don't recall him really adressing that publicly, at least not the way you did), and also about what happened to your friendship afterwards (even if it was sad), so I'm very thankful for that too. I wasn't expecting to be so emotional about you guys reconnecting, owning Smosh again and making content together, but I did grow up watching your videos too after all :)
this is so wholesome and wonderful. So excited for you guys and the future. Long live Smosh!
No disrespect to Anthony but I feel like a colossal amount of credit needs to go to Ian for never giving up on Smosh and getting it to where it is now.  I only started watching just after the Mythical buyout and I've always enjoyed the show; I'm glad they're both in the place they always wanted to be now.
5ttt
I know the bar is low and all that but I'm always happy to see guys talk their feelings out with their close ones.
To answer 29:00, the staff at Defy probably got a smaller version of Smosh deal. They were probably salaried employees who were working unpaid overtime, and also had stock options. So the idea is that Defy would go public and they would be the "next" Facebook kinda deal. It's  a very common practice in start ups, and especially media start up type business. So the employees would be pissed if suddenly via email you lost your job. I've been on that end of the stick many times in my professional career.
The real hour long special
I still remember their very first video I watched and it was Food Battle 2011. I remember seeing it in the Youtube feed when I got back from Trick or Treating when I was 13 and I was immediately hooked.
I swear, the creation of Smosh could easily become a movie with all the heart and drama that comes from smosh's journey.
I was around 6 - 8 when I found Smosh. And my humour was the Same as your guys 😭 and no YouTuber had my sense of humour at that time and then Smosh came around and I basically grew up loving Smosh. Smosh was the best thing. Glad to see it coming back.
Holy shit?!
IM SO HAPPY
i love that after all these years they both have the same laugh
Anthony seems so warm but Ian still so cold, couldn't even bother to give him a proper hug at the end, besides straight up telling Anthony he wouldn't show any emotion to him when Anthony was tearing up. I know this might be his cope mechanism to put up a front. and he may not be a bad friend, but goddamn he seems a bit nasty to deal with.
The sheer amount of times Ian has said “like” in this interview.
😢Can we expect food battles returning 😢?!?!
I’m not crying 🥲 you’re crying! Ok, well, we’re all crying 🥲 and it’s beautiful
This is so crazy
We love communication and therapy ❤
Two legends in one room.
omg get married!
I just want lunchtime with Smosh to come back. That's all I care about.
I just want to leave this here because even until now I do believe that the OG "Ian and Anthony duo" of smosh has it's own flare to it. I never felt that it was overshadowed by the other new casts of smosh, I mean I've laughed a lot with the videos that had the other new cast members don't get me wrong but the Ian and Anthony videos before still have a special place in my childhood. and Up until now I sometimes go that far back to watch the older videos you guys had over the new ones because it's always been good. You two have always been entertaining and it makes me happy to see you both back again.   ~As an Added note, Anthony did great on his own too. His videos are all very engaging and interesting. You are not defined by the brand smosh. I believe the same for the rest of the content creators out there along with Ian and the rest of the cast. you guys are your own person. I don't know if you'd ever get to read this but I at least wanted to drop this over as this feels like a big deal for me.
As a Smosh fan for 14 years, Hearing them talk about the new sketches not just being pandered towards the old fans gave me a huge sigh of relief. They are older and they aren’t supposed to be making the same stuff they already did. This is making me more excited for Smosh’s Renaissance Era.
So this means Food Battle 2023????
GHETTO SMOSH
The fact that they explain the membership thing really temps me to sign up just to support
Anthony pidildo and Ian hecocks 😍😍😍
next episode; I spent a day with Anthony Padilla
❤ nothing just ❤
I'm truly happy for the both of them, seeing them both grow as people and come back together again is wonderful. I wish them nothing but continued success! And I just want to appreciate how amazing Rhett and Link are, they've been such wonderful and supportive people this whole time. That they're just so happy and excited for Ian and Anthony is so heartwarming. Much love for Mythical and Smosh! <3
I still sing Smosh songs daily like I’m in surf city IM IN SURF CITY
It's enough to make a grown man cry.
We stan emotional openness and personal growth that leads to healthy relationships. 💯
This is the reunion everyone was waiting for ❤
Congrats
Please hang more privately from now on and don't forget to frickin celebrate the start of this jouney <3
We do not mention the milk fic
its so weird seeing them in the same room talking together in their mid 30s looking so grown up
what boots is anthony wearing?
I didn't know Anthony had an autoimmune condition, I have lupus nephritis and was out of school for a long amount of time too
Ow I'm crying so much, this really makes me happy, I'm glad that you both could speal openly and find peace!
I WAS A SMOSH THE MOVIE ENJOYER
LETS FUCKING GO THEY OWN SMOSH AGAIN
What about Ghetto Smosh?
Two legendary people ❤❤
Anthony please bring these boys together
Next step is to buy the old house back
This is divine intervention lol. There's no way that this could have happened naturally.
Kids at the time** guys 😂 I’m 22 years old now man you guys are making me feel old. I would watch y’all back when I was 10
You guys are among the og pioneers of youtube
I think I need to cry for a second I'll be right back.
Vou comentar em português porque sim. Simplesmente incrível saber que voltaram. Nem acredito.
I only remained a subscriber because I respected old Smosh. And with the hope that it may one day return to its original roots and glory. Patience is something I have an abundance of, and it seems to have paid off.
Probably bought smosh back for like 2 dollars cause the others made smosh so shit cringe and boring that it basically brought down its million dollar value
Anthony changed for the worse over the years 😳
i am so happy
Wow I remember showing my friends the Pokémon & mortar kombat lip sync vids when I was younger thinking it was hilarious. I remember when padilla left & wondering how the future of smosh is gonna be. And I remember realizing smosh is trash without padilla while really enjoying the content this channel was making.
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you". <3
FOOD BATTLE 2023
I didn't realise how much my soul needed this 🥹🥹 so glad you two are doing this 💜💜
I loved the old sketches, rather than the newer ones (Mainly because it was basically my childhood). Anthony and Ian's comedy and chemistry can never be beaten.
Smosh movie 2 when?
OMG OMGO MOG OGM O!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please talk more about your personal change over the decades ☝
I just heard Anthony Padilla utter the words: "Milk Fanfic, Goatsy, and Blue waffle", nature is finally healing.
Respect to that grade 6 science teacher
I feel like anthony is secretly in love with ian, and while ian also connects with Anthony on a same level, he is just too straight to fully fall in love...... or they're just good friends and it's the 12 yearold inside of me making this up, idk
We 👏need 👏a 👏Pod👏 cast👏!
"I'm just negging you." I'm dead.
56:30 it makes me so happy that Anthony actually ROFLed in real life
👍
The plot twist of this episode was, Anthony used the hack button on a dummy to make it look like ian and with some editing make it seems like Ian is there
I’m hoping so bad that the first video they post on smosh is food battle
yk it would be totally cool if there was another smosh movie in a few years except this time its about the story and struggles of Ian and Anthony
U
i loved smash the movie lmao
Man i use to watch these guys from 6th grade to my junior year of highschool its nuts knowing they’re together again a good part of 2023 2 best friends reunited smosh forever
aye Ian mom is back yes 😂 and since y’all are back does that mean food battle is back too
45:15 a good example of if you love something, set it free, if it comes back, it's yours. If it doesn't, then it wasn't meant to be and... just glad it was meant to be.   I think a lot of the oldest fans understood, at least I did, it felt like some inner working was at play, and for some reason it felt like both of you weren't exactly the same. Not that it entails the new content being bad, new things can be good, but I could sense something was wrong with you both. Not that I want to sound like I know a lot, but I have been through a lot of personal things, traumas, mental issues, myself. Wasn't fair if other fans were lashing out, upset, but not their fault either, they were sad, it was just a series of unfortunate events that... well affected everyone. Cool that you're both back, and back together, wish you the best moving forward, and hopefully your friendship especially doesn't hit these rough patches again, it seems like it needed too, and was important that it did, because you came from it stronger, but hopefully for you both it doesn't happen again, or at least not to as huge of a degree. Not even for us the fans, your health, your friendship should come 1st, is more important than anything, any content you can do, because... not to sound cheesy, but friendship is important.
Ian not fully expressing but essentially saying that he would never give up on Smosh. My fucking heart.
Tôi thích thương hiệu này
i love this
I no joke watched this entire video with a smile on my face
YES! AFTER SO LONG!
NOT THE MILK FANFIC!!!
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 Hell yeah !
Why does this look a bit like Rhett and Link?
There BACK
It seems like Anthony really thinks he/they were brilliant in creating Smosh. Ian seems like he knows they were just two extremely lucky idiots.
Smosh is legendary, Thats some OLDSCHOOL shite! Younger people needs some real internet culture from the past, we need to be reminded again why we watched smosh. "boxman" needs a return for example, or the pokimone one or the Transformers Theme video.  WELCOME BACK BOYS!
Smosh is your guys, simple
I cant believe Anthony got to interview Gordon Freeman
The two legends back at it again. Now over 30 and Anthony and Ian are back at it again 😢😂
we're so back
i havent seen smosh since you guys broke up
My brother and I started back up a month ago after missing it, and seeing you guys come back today has just made us so happy. We both still remember starting up in 2006 making comedy vids in Elk Grove and you guys being on the local news in Carmichael and being so stoked to know another duo was out there making stuff. We talked a long time ago back then once or twice on myspace haha but Ian, Anthony, MY DUDES. I'm so excited for you both and congratulations
This is a canon event.
Just healed my screaming inner child.
I remember seeing my first smosh video in 2012 literally on my mom's computer. It was the skit where everything you guys drew came to life. You guys have RAISED me - I honestly wouldn't be the same had I decided against clicking that random vid in 2012.
Lunch time with smosh looks DIFFERENT
Cool
I think they’ve made a couple episodes together before 🤔
Dude, that finish, if it has to burn, we do it together, that was cinema
healing
So this is what open honest dialog that is unguarded and openly recieved without judgement looks like.  This is very refreshing and should be used as an example.
😭😭😭 this finally happened!!!
holy shit guys, it's happening, after all these years
the video we have all been waiting for!
I sub next month, it will be my first Y memborship ever, but well worth it !
Props to the teachers making them science partners, either smosh wouldn’t have existed…
Mad respect for Ian. Let it be known that Smosh would have never made it this far if not for his resilience. He really believed in this project and he’s held on long enough to see it come back to fruition. That takes immense strength and patience.
Now that we have Ian and Anthony together again, let's have Ryan Higa and Sean Fujiyoshi
I remember being in middle school and a friend had me come over and watch this weird video he foind on this new site called Youtube. Smosh was the channel and it was two guys lip synching to Power Rangers. Made some of my best friends back in the day through watching Smosh, and i'm happy that this has happened.   Welcome back guys.   (Halfways expected to see the classic logo or hear "Shut Up!" At some point.)
this is a gift from heaven  THANK YOU  all of the childhood memories are returning
i screamed when i saw this after processing for 15 seconds
41:57 Ian I'm dead
never thought id hear the term "Cyber Space Celebrities" again  also im excited for food battle 2023
the nostalgia is real. and it has reaped its rewards.
Ngl I’m in mid 20s and I didn’t watch much of Smosh growing up. I knew about them, and maybe watched some videos, but was never that invested. I knew that they were good friends, if not best friends. So as an adult watching this video, it’s just actually nice to see you two, mature and grown men reflect on somewhat complicated history and be vulnerable with each other. This is a really good watch. thank you guys!
Wow.. I’m so happy for you guys. Its sad that the lifestyle caused you guys to grow up that way but grateful you guys are talking about it now. It’s never too late. Good luck guys!
Okay, that's pretty cool.
I think they may know Each other -s
Everyone knows what smosh is.
☹️💜💜💜
So........   Food fight 2023??????
Idk about you guys but I loved the movie
I am still shocked eventho i've been informed for like over a day
Omg they’re literally smoshing without even trying. This is what I’ve been waiting for.
Hi everyone; welcome to therapy
Ian says "like" a lot I can't unhear it now
So happy at this. Watched the whole video, that's how happy I am Smosh is back❤
Everyone at Smosh : "WHERE IS ANTONY!"  SMOSH NOW: "HE IS BACK!!!!!"
True friendship is forever, even if you take a break for a few years. Glad to see you both reconnect, and I'm excited to see where Smosh goes from here.
I started watching Smosh videos at 8 years old and Ian and Anthony were my first introduction to YouTube and the internet altogether. Now I’m 22 years old and as I’ve grown it makes me very happy to see how much they’ve grown too and matured as individuals. Even from an outside audience perspective it’s clear that things have aligned themselves for you both to reunite and become a creative team again! Also hats off to both of y’all for doing your personal work, seeking professional help, and being able to communicate openly with each other! I’m proud of my internet dads and excited for what’s to come :,)
The therapy session we needed
The reunion of the decade. 🙌  Also, imagine being that teacher that paired these two up together in the 6th grade... not knowing the dynamic duo you just created.
This made 11 year old me happy :)
It's honestly so cool to see and hear this. Smosh was a huge thing for me when I was a teen. I distinctly remember that I first found out about it when someone in a chatroom sent me a link to your Pokemon lip sync video. Ended up watching that countless times and started keeping up with your content. I kinda fell off around the Defy time because there was so much going on with your channels and it was off-putting for me personally. But now I'm really looking forward to your new stuff! 🙏🙏🙏 Thank you.
How many fools can I kill todaay...
o
Only OG Smosh fans watch the full video this is awesome and refreshing!
I have never watched Smosh, but I love this, mostly for you guys!
日本語字幕頼むわー お願い
omg hour long video
Literally the 2nd YouTube channel I ever subscribed to, and actually liked watching. The original SMOSH 🎉
Hooray to absolutely everyone involved who eventually allowed this to happen again. (Rhett & Link, et al)  I have some faith in humanity left! Cool to understand more about what was going on behind the scenes over all of those years. As a diehard fan of the both of you, as well as old and new Smosh, I am so happy and excited for all the new things happening recently! Let’s Do This! (Star Wipe)
Im so glad they are back doing their thing but can we all just give so much props to ian for sticking it out and getting his channel and compsny back god knows the boy has been through alot
I was Looking at the title Not thinking this then i just OHHH YEAAAA
ive never been happier
Fucking beautiful
Wait, are you still going to interview people on this channel? @anthony
Anthony is so sweet 🥺
I am crying, cannot deal with anything being back. but also talking with Ian over everything that has has happened.
ya'll have absolutely no idea how amazing this is to all of us
learning that anthony padilla and i share the exact same experience of being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease at age fifteen and having to leave school to do it from home for a semester because we were too weak was not on my 2023 bingo card.
for a second i lookes at it and thought "man when is he gonna interview anthony?" ...    I need sleep.
Still love shut up cartoons, dos and donts is amazing.
The planet is healing, Smosh is back
This feels so personal. Very mature and honest. I feel like I'm eavesdropping on a conversation that should be had in private but the camera didn't seem to affect them. And they seemed to hash out most of this in person. It's a great example of how some people just need time.
what is this? my childhood is restored? thanks?
I will remember all  The good times we had on Smosh We made some pretty weird ass videos Like what the f**k we're we doing here  We've not because Friendship always Wins 🥺
To be this old to see smosh rise and fall and rise again 🥲 love this
Honestly I was worried about this just not working, but seeing the way you two bounced off each other and even in serious moments a joke would be made and then built on, you two still have it
I feel like this is a good idea and it's going to be rocky at first for a little while. But I mean I hope it works out.
The 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Anthony please bring back lunch time with smosh with Ian to the smosh channel
That hug. All the internet needed. So happy for both of you. 😁😁😁😁😁😁
The world is genuinely healing bro
Food Battle?
NO NOT THE MILK FANFIC
Watching this helps me see where I am with my best friend and how relatable Anthony and Ian's relationship was and is now. I also feel like this is probably how X and Ski Mask must have felt during their friendship
0:34 u already can see the classic Smosh moment teaser there 😂😂😂
Anthony leaving Smosh was a canon event
will food battle return!?!?!?!?!?!
Its so crazy Rhett and Link, when told, 'hey, Anthony wants to come back, but only if we own it', were just like, 'the most important thing is that your best friend is back, we don't care about the business side of it'
Omg no way there together
I'll be honest. I haven't watched the main channel since anthony left. I did try, but it just wasn't the same. Dont get me wrong, the new cast and crew are hilarious people, but the magic of smosh is Ian and Anthony together. Because I do occasionally go back to their older videos and still get a laugh out of it. I thought i wouldn't because the comedy was kinda designed for raunchy teenagers, but it still holds up.
this was such an amazing video having watched smosh in the 2010¨s im so happy to see them get back together  doing this
Makes me so happy. Seriously just out if the blue made me so happy. Glad you guys are back at it. Happy trails y'all
I’m so glad for you guys you were part of my childhood. best of luck smosh is back on business ✊🏽❤️🎉
I am elated that you guys have Smosh back again Words can't convey how happy I am for you guys!
Listening then go so deep into their own personal friendship has me in tears.
The gangs back!!
The reunion finally!!!
I never knew Ian has such dry humor lolol but it’s amazing to see them rekindle their friendship
Either this is actually happening,  or someone put acid in my drink again
that's great guys.
dude if they bring back the "SHUT UP" intro ill die
SHUT UP!
When Ian "restarted" smosh I felt like he did it becase he thougt he "had" to for other people, that depended on it for theor livelihood.  This feels like him amd Anthony doing this becasie they want to.  I am so happy for them, thay they are siezing this opportunity to rediscover who they are.
I remember spending of my weekend with these two video in my high school years <3
SMOSH is back y'all 🥺
I just love how they've changed so much, but still were the same YouTube boys we all fell in love with. I'm so happy for smosh's return. Edit: As a long-time fan enjoying the changes, I'm even more excited to see the future of smosh.
this was so so special for me. I've loved you guys since i was 6 years old and im 18 i just can't believe how much you guys have grown.
Anthony starting to tear up around 41:50 is actually so sad yet so heart-warming
Wow they both really glow up 😊 Their vids are my childhood. I really love watching them eating together and opening fanmails together, can't remember the channel, ian is bored? I missed Charlie 😢
Oh wow, maybe i should subscribe to smosh again 😊
Yo! Congratulations on owning Smosh again!!!
Lol I was just thinking when they would do this 😂 no way!!!
Im overflown with joy my face looks like a 🌚
I'm so happy for you guys ur my heroes!!!❤❤❤
There’s no way😦
Holy.....! Finally. Between this and ocean fighting back, It feels like the world is finally healing.
Im really glad that they're in the right circumstances where they're able to do this
SMOSH IS BACK IM GONNA CRY OMG!! MY CHILDHOOD IS BACK!!!
I feel like their story could be a whole separate movie. From childhood friends making comedy sketches to a degrading friendship from difficult bonds to finally reconnecting and realizing what they had many years ago. I never knew how in depth their relationship and lives were
Every time I have a pogo I always eat the crispy bits
These boys actually raised me thanks
Ohhh nooo, they both run out of content & have to reunite? 😂
I LOVED the era when anthony was just floundering around on his new youtube channel!! It was super entertaining and fascinating to watch him find his voice <3
i always thought the downfall of smosh was when Anthony stopped smashing through the ceiling in his own channel videos
This is the best birthday gift of all time . ❤
🎉🎉🎉 Oh, Boy! 🎉🎉🎉
everyone is really happy to have you guys back, i remember the days when i was like 11 when y’all did lunch time with smosh😞
Anthony came back like a hero to smosh and join ian to make great times back again.
This was the episode I have been waiting for. I am truly happy about this. It makes me sad that YouTube takes 30% of the revenue and Patreon takes  5-12%, but I guess YouTube is better because it's easier to subscribe. It would be nicer if YouTube took less of a cut and allowed the creators to be paid more for what they make.  I hope someday YouTube starts to take care of its creators.
This video is so interesting. I'm glad this episode happened.
Naruto & Sasuke vibes
i would love to see the other smosh w/ Boze, Jovenshire, Lasercorn, Mari and Sohinki
I loved them so much back in the day. Middle School was a pretty shit time for me, so watching Smosh, Jenna Marbles, Jacksfilms, etc. always made me feel better.
The bloopers didnt feel like bloopers, it just felt like everything was just.... right
i feel my inner child healing a bit. smosh was my childhood and i stopped once i reached high school. its nice to revisit this time of my life through honest and open discussion. hyped for the new era of smosh!
This video has more views in 5 hours than some of the last months- damn😭
I definitely think Ian is still in that stage of self expression where he thinks showing too much emotion is cringey... whilst Anthony was able to kind of come to terms that it's okay to be vulnerable especially to people you know you trust. Hopefully, Ian does eventually learn to loosen up, and realize that no one's going to judge him for self expression. And if someone does, Anthony and the people he loves will always be there to protect him. In Anthony's case, he had Mykie around so he was able to grow comfortable expressing himself. I hope Ian finds that person for him.

World is finally fuckin healing man let’s gooo🎉
i am so happy seeing all the news about smosh, this is great  54:36 ian joking around with anthony like this is so funny lmao him looking back at him and shit
This was long anticipated, wow this reunion is nostalgic.
Ιve never clicked on a video this fast
This is such a powerful case study for sure! Absolutely excited to see where you guys go from here!
Oh
I felt a spark of childhood joy seeing this
I'm not crying you're crying
i hope the i spent a day with videos won’t end though now that they own smosh
Not Ian bringing up Anthony’s cringe daily vlogs LMAO
FINALLY
"SHUT UP!"   Congratulations you guys! So happy to see a piece of my childhood again
Leaving Smosh was Anthony’s Canon Event. Anthony and Ian buying Smosh was a brotherly canon event.
they said even if they came back and made the channel burned to the ground, im fucking burned down with these guys. I grew up with that channel. I’ll join them in the flames.
Smosh are Mordecai and Rigby
Hell ya let's go Smosh is back boyzzz!!!!!!!!
Does that mean the bowlcuts coming back?
fuck we are so old
This is honestly massive, I'm so glad you guys are back together again even if you aren't making more videos together.
Just from the title, I knew this was gonna be *deep.*
You guys are killing it witht his announcement this is the content child me, teen me AND adult me needed
OMG It's happening!
*CHILDHOOD FLASHBACKS* 😢
Now it's Ians time to go
I used to be a huge fan of these 2 on Smosh when I was growing up. I'm glad Ian finally showed up for an interview on Anthony's channel. You both helped inspire me to one day create YouTube content of my own, and now I have.
i cannot believe there's a video of ian and anthony in 2023 referencing the milk fic my brain is spilling out of my ears
This says a lot about how Ian and Anthony returning again is really one of the biggest cinematic crossovers of all time and one of the biggest steps in the history of mankind, so glad these OG YouTube legends got together again to give us more memories again… ✊💖
Food battle 2024???😮😮😮
I’m gonna fucking cry if they do a food battle
Feels so fucking good man.
such a healthy conversation.
Holy shit!
This moment just felt like the broken timeline just mended itself back together again. i really hope all the best for you two, but whatever happens in the future I'll always support you guys.
Smosh food battle 2023
When Ian says, "At the end of the day, it's just business," really reassures how I thought when Anthony left Smosh. He took all the soul with him.
I feel as if I’ve seen together before???????
32:31 just healed my inner child. Seeing these two reconnect gives me some of the best chills ever
The reunion we are dying for.
Congratulations guys!!! Glad to see you two back together and can't wait for what's next 🙂😁👍👍
Food Battle 2023???
YeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeS
* typing * smosh anthony ian milk fanfiction
*badly sings* REUNITED AND IT FEELS SO GOOD!!!! Love seeing these 2 finally back together again. The OG Youtube GOATS!!!!
I can't say thank you enough to Rhett and Link for understanding the need to preserve Smosh as part of internet culture and history. They have done the internet a huge service and will probably only be remembered as a small footnote in this story but I hope they hear all the love from this announcement and feel our gratitude.
Two kings return to their thrones 👑 👑
this still doesn't feel real
I never watched smosh, maybe saw one video. So as an "outsider" with no history to smosh, this was still an interesting video to watch and pick up on the history. (I knew of the downfall of defy from film theory) I came to this channel awhile ago because of Anthony and the interesting interviews, not knowing a thing about smosh. So good job to him for making his own thing.
Must've been real hard. Having this friendship baby in SMOSH. Then thinking you're doing the best for it and taking a leap of faith. Then seeing your child being flaunted around then tossed in the trash. Super hyped to see this happy ending. We got the boys back together. Wishing yall the best.
next is joji in cold ones
The duo of all time
I just want to say how crazy it is that they still do that magical bestfriend mind-link thing. I watched them both track exactly where the other was taking the conversation just by a subtle noise or gesture. That alone shows just how much they know each other, and like they mentioned, it really is such a natural back and fourth between them.
This hit so hard, seeing them together again, 😭😭😭❤❤❤
Les funkinnnn goooooooooooo  This literally the highlight of my year. And at the possible time off summer vacation. Time the relive my childhood. Thank you lot
Smosh is the reason my humor is fucked up
This is basically the same level as Valve announcing HL3
AHAHAA I LOVE YOU!!!! I'VE THE BEEN ASKING THIS FROM THE START OF THE CHANNEL
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your friendship shows through so hilariously strongly in this lmao. The scene where you both were thinking about buying Smosh is just classic.
I am so happy Smosh is back, like a real sense of happyness! I missed you gys, annd the reals Smosh humor. It always supported me and formed my sense of humor as it is today.
Wait, Ians surname is Hecox? I always thought it was Hiscox
these guys have such a great chemistry they’d make a great youtube duo 😁
Ian is so daddy
The way that this is healing divorce trauma from both smosh and my childhood
Ian and Anthony are honestly pop culture legends at this point, the original Youtube stars, smosh is one of the reasons YouTube even took off, they will be forever beloved for that
Okay, but I need a podcast from the two of you. Like just this level of *real* was so god damned good
The episode i was wishing for when i came to know about this channel. And i thought it to be impossible but the more impossible thing just happened smosh was real again free from every other chore.
im crying tears of joy
Heard ian was a bit of a douche but anthony seems chill as always
THEY'RE BACK AGAIN😭😭💝
My anticipation is incomparable
This Is going to be ASWOME!
YouTube depends on you guys this is beautiful
Gosh, if I remember correctly I was watching smosh when i was in third grade, I think the first video I saw was the food battle i think the original one. I used to laugh so much just watching you two messing around and growing up as i grew up. Now I'm beginning collage which is a whole new mess of things but thankfully and hopefully you guys working together and bringing in videos will provide many hours of fun during my long night study sessions. I hope your friendship blossom again and become stronger then ever.
Damn rhett and link has a lot of money to throw around hahaha
i want this kind of friendship in my life
This is the way!!!
It reminds me of the BFF song they made 11 years ago in the “ I lost my hair “ vid Can they sing that song again 🥹🥹🥹
Now we just need Sugar Pine 7 and Cow Chop to revive from the dead
Nice
SHUT UP!!  But no, this was actually a really cool thing to see after growing up with Smosh. I felt the tension with the later videos, but had nothing but questions after the end of the pairing. But at that point I knew that they needed the space. Whatever the falling out was, it was personal, and people needed to move on.  Distance is so very important and almost impossible to explain to someone special. When you stack relationships with the same person/group, for a very long time, it seems doomed to fail. Just moved back in with my family after a decade, and the tension is insane. Too many expectations and conflicting ideals.
I've never clicked faster
Smosh was a big part in my childhood I was one of those 10 yr olds 😂
lit
Smosh was the very first YouTube channel I found when I was little I’m 23 right now I made my first YouTube channel to subscribe to smosh because of your Pokémon in real life videos it’s amazing to hear you guys own the channel again it’s like seeing an old friend after years of not talking
I’m crying this is a long time coming I’m so happy for this new era of smosh.
"Even if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do it with you"  I was holding back to crying but that shit just was just beautiful
Just wanted to say. I am 31 years old and I've been following you guys since day one. And this is so exciting for a day one fan. Glad you guys rekindled and it's so surreal that this is happening. Excited for a new chapter. Kind regards. Long long time fan.
I think Ian is not on the same page with Anthony. It seems like he still has some resentment and jealousy. His body language is very reserved. And throughout the video he makes some jokes idk as if there was a competition between them. I hope he finds his confidence. Because at first I was very excited to see them reunited. But now I’m not sure the conflict won’t grow again. I might be wrong though, and I hope I am.
And not even just for our entertainment, but you guys hanging out as bff again like the old days… two bff be In together makes my heart so full.
I can't believe how happy this makes me...
Hey Anthony I know you probably aren't going to see this but I was wondering if you could make a video on people with Juvenile Dermatomyositis or JDM I've had it diagnosed for about a year and really want to learn more about other people with it.
Hall of Famers
they were my childhood and I'm so exited to see what they do next.
Ian apologising about the un-aliving joke knowing Anthony's demographic, really shows the self awareness of his actions. It was such a nice moment. Love seeing the boys together again after all these years !
This is the perfect alternative universe. Pls don't turn on the particle collider again.
this video is so unbelievably culturally significant to the timeline of the internet. seeing the original sketch comedy channel and what defined early youtube, especially early comedy on youtube,  come back together as a whole project again is crazy. we all look forward to the projects you guys go forward with, and congrats on buying your guys channel back!
A few days ago I was on the smosh channel and I was seeing how sad it was Ian being all lonely. THEN THIS?!?
Be yourselves, the stress of a business is hard but don’t forget what started it all and the friendship you guys made to get here. I grew up with you guys and it hurt to see you two split. Be your best selves and leave room to be friends not business partners. I missed you both! And I can’t wait for smosh to return to its roots and true self!
This is a historical moment so im just gonna  "SHUT UP!"
this feels so strange. im not used to ian acting so mature and serious. never just seen him candid without any character
The one reboot I’m not mad about. 😂
wow hour long ad :(
😭😭
This is the best
anthony leaving smosh was a canon event
Oh shit....
*Spending a day with my BESTFRIEND
Anthony's regret face during that hug... HA
bro no way i was watching all their old videos earlier thinking damn when they gon do sum together again
Finally!!!!!!🎉❤
it's funny how their content appealed to kids at the time who are now adults... and im one of those kids... my siblings were like wtf are you watching.
holy shit
no waay
YEAHHHH
Nature is healing
loved these dudes as a little boy TY SMOSH
We should declare this upload date as a national festival.
This is the start of a new era
I'm so excited you guys are back together! I would love to see a Smosh podcast! And plz do lunchtime with Smosh again! ❤
this makes me so happy, i remember me and my best friend bonding to your guys videos
Yeah Anthony always has been the more realistic and more likable  this shows me why
Smosh is back again, it’s good to see you back
title should be "I spent a day with MY BEST FRIEND"
all I can say is LETS FUCKING GO
Love that the duo boys are back. Watched almost every single project that they’ve made from mortal kombat song to Ian is bored, etc. etc. Glad I’ve stuck around to witness history again 🥹❤️
I'm really happy for y'all. I'm glad you were able to reconnect and have that spark again. I grew up on Smosh, and im really excited to see what y'all are cookin now.
wait what milk fanfic
this is like the second pair of ppl from my childhood coming back together again
“Even if it doesn’t do well, I know it’s right. Even if we burn it to the ground I’m happy do it with you”  sobbing.
This interview is 💯 the outline for the next Smosh movie
Omori episode? 22:45
you guys should make a new/old smosh video
I'm so excited to see them again, smosh became so unpersonal and I stopped watching; I ran to resubscribe :D
I didn't even think people wouldn't know what smosh is
Omg
Feel bad for Ian
Am I the only one that took a second to realize that Anthony was part of Smosh. I miss those days.
It was a long time coming. I'm getting literal goosebumps.   Thank you for a gift that keeps on giving.
I enjoyed smosh the movie 🤭
love this, but off topic, could you guys let ghetto smosh keep going, it was unironically the best thing coming out at the time
The milk fic lmaoooooo
We gotta appreciate how supportive Rhett and Link has always been even when it came to selling Smosh back to Ian and Anthony. They really are the real OGs that held onto Smosh and really cared about it.
i am so unbelievably happy rn
Yall could put sponsorships at the beginning of your sketches aswell if you want to support them.
FOOD BATTLE IS COMING BACK!
Time to resurrect Charlie the drunk Guinea pig
Hey I totally believe in y’all making fresh content, but I definitely still wouldn’t be mad if you guys made a new “If Movies Were Real.”
Imagine if Anthony straightened his hair for the first sketch 😂
After 6 long years it finally happened 😅
35:00
Why am I crying
i grew up on smosh and one of my most memorable moments from my childhood was getting my ipad taken at my grandmas house for watching smosh and i could only have youtube kids. heartbroken and wanting to get back to thar happiness. when i finally got normal yt back, anthony left smosh n i remember sobbing so hard. ive been waiting for this day to come since i was a little kid. thank you.
Ever since you’ve guys broke up I’ve been praying for another food battle  I never thought it would be possible again
I hope they bring back a house setting or something recurring like they had before
I loved hearing how Ian was all skeptical about trying to make a sketch with Anthony again, and then everything clicked like back when they were kids
Can someone tell me the timestamp when Ian got the text from rhett&link?
Hearing how Ian was so sure that there would be a bunch of collabs between Smosh and Anthony's Channel after the initial departure and him realizing how that would probably never happen makes me feel like all the "Where's Anthony?" bits must've stung much more than we realized since Ian must've been wondering the same thing for all those years
Who’s this guy?    But seriously, I was so excited when I saw this pop up on my feed.
It’s foking amazing they’re still friends
They are in a way , a best friend almost gay -married couple now in their 30 years anniverseri ! ah good time ! But if this is learn lesson : "don't do same business with someone you love" . Although everything  they still friend and that speak for another level of relationship .
Honestly, I dont think rhett and link would have sold it to anyone else other than anthony and Ian, after what defy did to them.
Existing is exhausting. Amen to that ahaha
wow.
cant wait to finally be able to see the follow up product in  the meat and go timeline
im 24, watched you guys religiously in late primary school/early high school and this made me cry haha happy for you guys :))
This video is like an Earlier Christmas Gift! It is good to see you guys again!
I'm not crying you guys are
Es como ver a los dioses regresar al Olimpo...
2006/2007 was a whirlwind time
Please bring back food wars
this legit made me feel so emotional
Honestly all I can say is that this is amazing. I'm so glad you guys have been able to do what's best for you, and of course, I cant wait to see the awesome stuff you guys put out for us the audience.
Next i wonder if hed Interview JonTron and EgoRaptor together
Seeing them in one room feels so surreal now.
"It's interesting because we did have to let go of our friendship and find each other again later on. We had to let go of the _idea_ of what our friendship was, because our idea of friendship was shaped by the audience and the expectations that the audience put on us"  amazing quote by Ian, well said.   I really do feel like Anthony's and Ian's relationship was heavily content and business related, and like Anthony mentioned before they never really got to hang out as legitimate friends outside of the space that they had created for their audience. So this was an interesting perspective to delve into with their relationship because i had always thought that they were friends through and through and that they did everything together outside of content creation and youtube.   But big props to them for final coming to a conclusion together and buying back what they had started. I'm so glad that Anthony and Ian has rekindled their friendship and passion for content creating and doing what they love to do. Here's to many more years of Smosh. ❤
What an incredible duo. They should make a YouTube channel together.
I’m crying! I feel like a part of me was found. You are Smosh! YouTube Mountains with everyone else sitting on your shoulder. I hope we get to see another food battle!! (Pink)🍩 vs ramen 🍜  👀
I cant wait for Chanse to meet Anthony, and be completely clueless
Anthony and Ian are basically Sasuke and Naruto storyline in real life. Two friends grow up as friends and then separate for a huge time and then come back together as a team.
OH MY GOSH I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
It's so good to see them together after so long never thought this would ever happen ❤
🥲
I honestly was a kid watching you, and I think it made my personality better off for it
Y’all owe Dianna flowers or cake at the very least for helping you reconnect! Seriously though, I’m so glad to see you’ve both grown so much as people, and I’m excited for what’s to come!🌻
assassins creed and legend of zelda music parody is still the best 👌
Rhett and Link are truly the dads of early YouTube culture. Through every issue, every financial struggle, they truly support the actual talent born from this site. So much respect.
Rhett and Link's wholesome reaction to Ian telling them the news makes me love them even more.
Man, this is so surreal. I'm so ready for this. I even find myself going back to those old videos and laughing out loud like they came out yesterday. I feel like even when smosh hangs it up, having them own it again with full control is the perfect storybook ending ❤
1:11:36
Will you continue to post here?
Amazing to see you two talking about the behind the scenes so openly I'm so happy for both of you for finding yourselves!
The only thing missing is for you or Moist to buy Machinima
crazy
smosh has helped me through so many hard times, and not just main cast smosh, but the classic smosh too. seeing you guys talk with each other and watching this video makes me so happy and excited for this long awaited reunion. cant wait to see what the future brings not just for smosh, but the re connection of two best friends.
If you love someone, set them free. If they come back, it’s meant to be.
Soooo glad you guys got smosh back ❤❤
My elementary school best friend and I grew up on classic Smosh and became closer by having Smosh marathons on sleepovers, fighting with you guys to the Mortal Combat theme and singing Boxman at the top of our lungs. Today, we are bonding over how excited we are to see you guys together again. It feels like our lives are weirdly connected, like we've all grown into adulthood together. All of us changed, and yet still the same goofballs at heart. I can't wait for this new era.
Aaa my childhood memories flooded back
This is so surreal! Such a beautiful friendship 😢. Every now and then Ian or Anthony would reminisce on their connection with each other. Totally unexpected. Truly a beautiful and perfect friendship.
We need Food Battle back!
Finally, what we’ve been waiting for 6 years
dude, i droped a tear at the last minutes, you have been part of my early teenage years, and i still have some of your old songs in my playlist, you made me and so many teens so happy, so im very very pleased to hear te good news! il wish you the best and we are going to be there rooting for you!
Bring the fanfics back
omg i think this ep is healing my inner child
it's gonna be so amazing to finally watch Classic Smosh again ❤
From classmates to cyber celebrities.
This makes me so happy.  Truly.  I’m so excited to witness this and what is to come.  Seriously, as a 35 year old who’s consistently watched the content it is just great watching friends re-unite like this.  Can’t wait for what’s next! Best of luck to everyone involved 🎉❤🎉
The way I started to tear up finally seeing the people who I've watched since I was four in the same room together once again. I'm so happy
Ian looks like he could the doopleganger of Ned from the try guys.
You and this “Ian” guy seems to have alot in common considering you only spent a day together
oh my goddddd
Anthony, I would suggest making a short version of this video and/or maybe just "pushing" this video a little more to the smosh audience and youtube audience in general in order to get more people to fully understand what happened, what's happening and more importantly what you want to happen. Cheers! I'm happy for you both!
The magic of smosh was always two best friends being idiots on camera.
Smosh ❤😮
Our boys are back in the kitchen baby LETS GOOOO!
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYY
THE MILK FIC HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YALL YOU DID NOT HAVE TO BRING IT UP
Always dope to see two homies patching things up. Life is too short to hold grudges with an old close homie.
I liked the movie 🥺 and remember buying it to watch with my friend also  remember dying laughing when Anthony had a microphone stuck up his ass 😭😭
The OGs ❤🎉
Genuinely the most interesting interview I’ve ever seen
I know this gonna be good even before watching
Honestly, I would LOVE to see a conversation between Ian, Anthony, Rhett, and Link about their thoughts on what it's like running a Youtube channel with a best friend you've grown up with. I know Rhett and Link have definitely talked about the topic at least once on like a podcast or something, and I'd love to see them share their experiences and opinions on it
Anthony please talk to Ian and consider continuing the series Ian Is Bored again cuz it was fire
Wait werent these the 2 Emo Guys back in the Day?
Time heals all wounds
Man duck defy
The perfect ending
You guys are the best. You've each gone through your struggles and have grown. It's great seeing you together again, I look forward to seeing your natual cemestry together again. Congratulations on rekindling SMOSH!! 😀
The funniest, the truest, the most touching, wholesome and best interview!!! I'm in tears! I love you guys and I was with you since the beginning of smosh. I practically grown up with you!! It's great to see you become the people you are today and having find the way back to each other is great to witness!
Also wtf they both got so hot, and the drippppppp
“If we burn it to the ground I’m happy to do that with you” - Ian Hecox 😭❤
Holy cow now SMOSH will be great again with these Goats in the helm
I can't believe my childhood is coming back 😮
Im waiting for the I carly meme on this one
1:11:37  literally cry a little😭 when Ian said "If we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you"
Jesus Loves all of you guys <3
😮
"I spent a day with Ian Hecox." Me: "Tbf you spent first decade of youtube existence with Ian Hecox."
This video is great at showing that both guys are pretty smart business wise but still know how to have fun. So glad to see SMOSH return after so long!
I love seeing this.  Never thought this would ever happen but, I am happy to see you both in a better place and moving forward to a better future.
We all knew this day was coming, we just had patience for it 😌😌
It’s enough to make a grown man cry,and that’s ok.
It’s funny cuz I was one of those kids that wasn’t supposed to be watching smosh(happy seeing this a day before my birthday)
I was lonely at lunch in school sometimes as a kid. I could not wait to watch an episode of lunchtime with smosh while I eat mine. Sometimes I’d even go as far to wait a day and get the same food. I also remember auto correct spelling Amish (smosh) many times and that being a funny joke once. Oh the nostalgia! So good to have came across this. Thanks both of you!
I am so happy
my entire childhood entertainment returning right on my birthday (june 27) after all these years is absolutely amazing, i've watched the same videos over and over again when i was younger, thank you for all you've done and i hope you guys continue doing well, and to everyone reading this as well
lol this made me feel like when tom delonge rejoined blink, super happy
They bought it. THEY BOUGHT SMOSH
Smosh is as old as me 😭
Two of the most gay looking straight men
"spent *a* day" sounds like an understatement with the way you two have history
The fact that Anthony guests in Smosh and Ian being here in Anthonys show...rekindling their friendship is an awwe to see😢😢😢😢
Growing up with Smosh, this interview was full of an amazing cathartic feeling. Finally, my boys, FINALLY! It was like holding your breath from the moment they separated and now you can finally breathe out and breathe in fresh air.
👍👍👍👍👍Smosh👏👏😀😀😀
I grew up with these guys and Smosh, since the very begining, that was so many years ago now... I'm so happy that you two are together again ❤
IM IN DISBELIEF! Bdw Ian looks hella skinny now? Hopefully it was on purpose and he isn’t depressed😂🙏 SMOSH IS BACK!!
Ian and Anthony is back!!! hoping pink guy joins back in
I wish you all the best! I hope from now on Smosh will become the chanel of your dreams! Keep up the good work! You are doing this perfectly.
So exciting!
I lost hope that this would happen, to see it makes me so happy
Are certain smosh series staying. Theres a couple nee series that I love. Funeral Roasts and Revenge stores between the casts
it happened 😭 this is such a great news 💜
this feels like a dream omg
I never thought I would see the day 😂 glad the channel is back! (I'm one of those kids who watched. Now In my 20s)
I still can’t believe this is real.
This is so coooooool! I'm so happy this is happening! It's much better than I'd ever imagined a conversation with Ian would be <3
Is this heaven? Am I dreaming? Ian and Anthony together again? ❤❤❤
I mean the first time i ever watched the movie i loved it the 2nd time it was awful but still loved it either way
Wow, never thought we’d see the day. Thank you for being so transparent about everything. This reunion is beautiful and we are all rooting for you guys!
Is it just me or do they get sexier with age?
This is so heartwarming. When is your wedding going to happen? Gay Marriage is legal now :)
good luck with the new chapter of smosh and please please please dont lose each other again, do what is best for your friendship because it's amazing
Reminds me of watching you guys in 2005-2006. Great times.
"The internet is a fad" -A dumbass many years ago (roughly in the 2000's)
I actually enjoyed the Movie tbh
Just one word - amazing. I am so glad that you got back together and give Smosh a 2nd life.Soon we will all forget the dark times and just know - it was all a TimeSkip!
damn i thought you guys would just be punching eachother 0_0
I credit the milk fanfic for keeping their bond held together through all of the turmoil
nature is healing
unbelievable this is happening. i feel like i got closure from this and im literally completely unrelated to these people
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Okay, I think everyone wants it…food battle 2023
Ian seems destroyed as an individual. I feel really bad for him.
😢
We need a smosh renaissance guys 😊😊😊
Smosh is finally reunited mfs
I never thought I’d see this happen! I grew up with Smosh and I’m so glad to see you guys come back together and discuss all these things so honestly!
love the candid conversation between you guys. I had a thought around minute @53:00 where you say "we dont see so many sketch comedy channels because it costs too much". I immediately thought of Viva La Dirt league, they make some insanely great content, have you guys taken any inspiration from channels like them or any others?
You guys were my frickin childhood man! Yall still got the same old chemistry
I would be friends with Ian and Anthony in person, but I don't like them as much as the last gen of smosh
Shut up I'm not crying
God knows how long I waited for this!
As someone who is around the same age as Anthony and Ian, this is so fucking heartwarming man. My childhood best friend and I also had a falling out years ago, and have managed to rekindle that flame. I immediately sent her this video and a long heartfelt message about how I'm just so happy that we're back to being close and have reconnected to being our old selves again. This shit really made my day, and has filled my heart. 🖤
Ian’s shirt looks like a Costco cheese pizza.
AHH YESSS
Holy crap
9:58
As somebody who didn't keep up with you much after Smosh (I mean, I'd stopped watching Smosh after Smosh Games and stuff started to become more about the Crew than about The Two of You), I was kind of shocked when Anthony left. Not because I thought Anthony couldn't make it without Smosh (I mean, that was a possibility but you clawed your way back to the top, which is fucking amazing). No, I was just thinking "Smosh doesn't exist without Ian and Anthony". If you guys just left Defy and made your own thing and called it "Slosh" I honestly feel like you would've had a shot.
I hope that you guy can learn that how many Chinese people watched your video. there are even a account posted your videos with Chinese subtitles !! Your guys were my favorite YouTubers 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 i am crying so hard seeing you show up together  I literally watched your every single video I miss you sm 😭
I hope anthony still does this series tho he is such a good host
weirdly i was just thinking this should be an episode just yesterday
This is the peak of our younger years in the multiverse of timelines, ladies and gents.  My younger self is so beyond happy that these two are back. Let’s fucking go.   Let’s… Fucking… Go…  *We are in the endgame redemption arc!!*
It is so amazing to see your perspectives of Smosh growing and some of what happened in the background. I’ve watched you since I was like 12 and it’s crazy to see an adult conversation about it
Finally
Woooooo yeaaahhhhhh😭😭😭
I thought I was dreaming but this is FR!! 😮
My heart 😭😭😭
Pissing cumming shittin and screaming rn😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is a really good episode. Ian saying "you had to find your own voice" and then look at the tone of this video right here, it's so different to Smosh. This channel is way more serious, Smosh is funny but this series is way more grown up in comparison. It's great to have Anthony back with Smosh but I hope we keep both of the voices. Both the immature comedy of Smosh now and the nuanced voice we see speaking right here. Great therapy session guys. For your next vid, could you bring a licensed therapist in to talk about this discussion in a way which is psychologically medical?
Every once in a while I would look up old YouTubers for nostalgia, it’s been a few years now tho. I use to watch you when I was 9 or 10 and now I’m 25. That’s crazy that that number is gonna keep going up an up. One day it will be 25 years since I first watched you
It's great seeing you guys together again, congrats, and thanks to Rhett & Link. 31:02 Oh no, those costumes and music videos are iconic, I hope if someone has them they send them back your way as a reunion/welcome back goodwill. (If not, maybe someone might have the skill to replicate them for you guys down the track.)
This was a great watch. So happy for you both and looking forward to the future Smosh direction…
I grew up with these two on Youtube, and this episode is everything I wanted it to be. Who else is hyped for the future of Smosh?
In our time, it feels like the internet is just breaking apart at the seams, but this genuinely feels like an internet wound being fully healed. fantastic news.
This was such a great video
It’s like christmas miracle.
I WASN'T PREPARED
This was just a cannon event
Aaaaaand the internet breaks
This is fucking inspirational
My Childhood 🥲
The realest video ever
This is proof that the world is not going to shit, this has given me life. Cried 3 times Great video, smosh was the first channel I ever followed when I was like 9 or 11. I am now 21 and couldn’t be happier
Welcome back guys. 🎉
W
Ian was probably bitter after a while of Anthony leaving smoosh bescause he felt like he lost his friend
I wish this said, I spent a day and a lifetime with Ian Hecox
i never thought this would happen. my childhood is coming back!
The best canon event to ever happen on this earth
OH MY GOD I LOVE YOU 2 SM❤️❤️❤️❤️
Let's give our self's a clap for the collective internet manifesting this for centuries
You have no clue how loud 10 year old me is screaming
I'm glad to be able to see that conversation but also I kinda hope you guys had that conversation off-camera first
I’ve been on the verge of tears ever since I saw the news. I’ve still been watching Smosh through all the years. This is so wild. I never expected it to happen, but holy shit am I looking forward to this!!!
oh god im so EXCITED FOR THIS AND FOR YOUR JOURNEY TO CONTINUE! I LOVE AND MISSED U GUYS!!
So we gonna lose the hot girl now?
lol i remember watching the smosh movie i think i watched it on netflix at my cousin's house
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG YES
YESSSSSSSSSSSSA
Ian really looks like a half burnt up tortilla
I can't even begin to express how excited I am for you guys.  I started watching your videos back in 2007-2008 and loved your content ever since. After your separation, sadly, the Smosh channel isn't as attractive anymore, on the other side Anthony's been able to find his footing on the platform once again.  I've never spent a dime on YouTube but I'm using my visa on this one, if you're back together then I'm supporting you to the end 🎉🎉🎉
All emotions aside when is food battle 2023
This means so much to me I grew up on old smosh like I watched it when I probably shouldn’t have😅
1:11:29 "Even if it doesn't do well, I know that this is the right thing. And if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you." My reaction was the same as Anthony's 😭💜
I loved smosh the movie idk why it was funny to me, love seeing you two making a video together again
i completely forgot about the milk fanfic. i think they read it on camera once with sohinki/lasercorn/joven/mari. i just had this feeling of dread wash over me when anthony brought up milk, like when someone brings up mr hands or bobobo again.
it’s crazy how much they have grown and how much we as an audience have grown and where we are standing now
holy shit are we getting food battle 2023
It's nice to understand the gaps as the viewer. It's like this entire interview let's us all in to the true motivations between both parties and to reconnect and rebuild is incredibly incredibly fortunate and I know the old and new fans are gonna be excited for what's next
I am not a child of divorce anymore
So happy for them
What came first, Balloon Shop or Smosh?
11:38 wtf bro😂
this is wild man, I still can’t believe it
Ian thinking this was gonna be boring but I love seeing people talk about deep stuff and past hurt and understanding each other and hearing each other out to work through it and move forward. It’s so refreshing to be able to see people hearing each other out instead of just fighting and not trying to hear the other person out.
Bringing back so many good memories
Well that morning(yesterday),As someone who was watching for old time sake of watching old smosh vids like I did in high school. I was so shocked & excited to hear that they were they were coming back together just a few hours later. I felt at first like “Am I being messed with, like is this a dream bc I WAS just watching these guys earlier?!”
I think a second season of "let's do this" with anthony's participation would be very cool! Maybe something like team hecox vs team padilla or just them both taking turns in pitching the challenges... anthony is a more intuitive guy, I think, so that's a nice twist perhaps Anyways, happy to see this! In a way I am grateful of how all this came to be: simply put I am a GMM guy. I knew about smosh, but only at surface level. The roast funeral of rhett and link introduced me to that series and ithooked me. Haha
Love you guys. I understood why Anthony wanted to distance himself. I hated that everyone was so cruel to him for finding his own space. I've always been a fan and I am 28 OK. You have adult fans.
Great to see this conversation, happy for you guys!
i love you guys so much, as a part of my childhood and just as two awesome people. I’m really looking forward to this, and to you guys getting canceled.
what I like about this video is it felt less of an interview and more of a talk between friend and we were just a fly on a wall
YESSSSS
They seem like they're always juuusst about to fight
Needa see a modern day Lunch time with smosh
Seeing the young stars coming back together once more is such an amazing moment on the internet. I am so excited for the first video!!
Watching this video gives the same feeling as finally being able to lucid dream and getting a full night's sleep to enjoy the whole thing.
Seeing you guys together makes me so happy.
We're the children that you've raised
6 years. 6 years we've been waiting for this. Holy fucking shit
Talktime with Smosh
While watching this I couldn't really focus bc of how much Ian looks like Ben Platt. Anyone else see it?!
Best thing happening on YouTube right now. It felt to me like this site needed you two back together!!!
I really love the old and new smosh, both were comically fresh for their time period and targeted audience. Golden era was good but so was the era after anthony left. Kudos to Ian, Courtney, Damien, Shayn, Noah, Jackie, keith for not playing nostalgia and giving something different and making a new personality.
You guys seriously shaped my childhood. Also, as a non English speaker, your videos were the gateway of developing a huge understanding of the language as well as the cultural references. Also, the added humor made your videos a necessity to watch daily. Thank you with all my heart.
This is just one giant therapy session for both Ian and Anthony, and I’m all here for it.
I still miss lunch time with smosh lmfao and the mail times ! Classic shit
Nothing more special than 2 best friends, talking about the sh*t they went through
This feels like my parents explaining to me why they’re getting a divorce
41:55 had me dead 💀
im whole again
THE YOUTUBE GODS ARE BACK  FINALLY
Anothony and Ian are Smosh
They needed this conversation
I PREDICTED THIS
So good to see my childhood come back again so happy for you both!
I subscribed to Smosh again!
I'm 23 yrs old and these guys pretty much raised me so I'm so ready to support this comeback
Boy, Anthony sure does like to talk about himself
This timeline is insane
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT
If the world would end tomorrow, this would be such a great story with such an amazing trilogy of “Smosh Glory Days,” “Defy: the Dark Days,” and “The Mythical Rebirth of Smosh.” This is a perfect and triumphant ending.   But… I wonder what will happen now. Is it still going to be as good as it is right now with Anthony’s input? I have a lot of hope, but I still worry a bit that this high can only come with major changes.
The smosh movie was horrible….but when it first came to Netflix I literally watched it every night before bed
im actually so excited to watch this new content
Now we need a smosh game bang
Ian and Anthony reconnecting and getting Smosh back has now healed my inner child
Mmmm...Mhmmm...Mmmm.
The “get well soon” card meaning so much to Anthony- even when Ian doesn’t remember doing it- that little action meant so much to him and I don’t know how to put this into words, but the way that kind of message can transcend through everybody’s life. I’m crying.
This whole conversation should be a case study on how to communicate between friends when relationships get tough. This should be taught in school. I'm not even joking the level of maturity is off the charts
"not me suggesting this episode 4 years ago"
The episode we have been waiting for
I cried so much watching this. ❤️
gotta love these boys
Praise God
He finally did the thing he did the thing
This still feels like a whole dream to me  I WAS TIRED AF WHEN I FIRST SAW THE TWITTER ANNOUNCEMENT
Maybe you know this already but I think this story that you told of you starting smosh, and falling out and the time spent away from smosh and ians side and then you reuniting are all things or recipes you could say for a really good smosh movie, THE REAL SMOSH MOVIE. just saying...you don't have to make it, it just feels right to say for me.
41:44 and 1:11:30 i am crying so hard at both of these moments. i am so incredibly happy for you guys. holy shit man i’m a mess right now i can’t believe this is happening.
i miss youtube sketch comedy
Is lunchtime with smosh and smosh is bored coming back
this news coming out made me realise just how much of my childhood was influenced my Smosh and you guys. i feel so happy for you guys <3
"And if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you" - Ian and anthony on the verge of crying ;; I'm so happy for them
Congrats Anthony! 👌🔥 I’m happy to see you this happy
What an incredible moment in the history of YouTube. 🎉🎉🎉
Yall should buy YouTube
Glad to see you guys in one shot again)
A DAY ISNT ENOUGH, SPEND A YEAR, A CENTURY, FOREVER 😭😭😭😭😭
I never EVER comment... I didn't realize I'd be this excited about this in my thirties! Thank you for letting me grow up with you guys! I'm glad to see the OG Youtube duo together, again! Do you, boo boos! Be your authentic selves! ❤️❤️❤️
I did not know this day would ever come, but 11 year old me and 21 year old me are ecstatic and so proud🥲💕
smosh cartoons? or i unsub
I searched up smosh milk fan fiction right after 1:13:08
I am 34 years old and have my best friend Perry still that we would watch your videos together all the time. Seeing you guys back together feels like the world is healing. I’m so excited to watch the future and so happy y’all are friends again!❤
Two bros chillin in the studio 3 feet apart cause they are not gay !
at the end of the day.... us , we, the community really made this happen?!
fathers are back together
listening to this midway, seems to me that theres not that much to savor behind the screen in the first place, so i hope were not reading the same book twice
It's great to see you two are back together. I think it's awesome, actually. Two childhood friends who've built an audience together with content that was overall entertaining. I remember watching you guys back on my PS3. I was 12 years old at the time. Enjoyed watching all of your videos.   I also enjoyed the absolute hell out of Shut up Cartoons (was that the channel name?). Freaking Embarrassing Stories was a good one. But really, thank you for pushing those videos out. It was awesome to watch. Can't wait to see you guys posting content together again after such a long time.  I'm 22 years old right now and in college. Time sure does fly, and I'm grateful to live in an Era where Smosh became a thing. I'm sure there are plenty of others who feel the exact same. Thank you, guys. It's gonna be awesome seeing Smosh again!  PS: Good on you Anthony for finding yourself. Going through self-discovery isn't easy but it's worth it. Being you is better than allowing your ego to get the best out of you.
It finally happened!!
BRING BACK LUNCHTIME WITH SMOSH
1:11:32 TEARS ACTUAL TEARS I FUCKING NEEDED THIS
The beginning hug was so prime Smosh Anthony and Ian!
OMG NO FUCKING WAY. WE HAVE WAITED FOR THIS FOR SO LONG
Seeing Anthony and Ian together again is like a belated birthday gift. I teared up listening to this, it’s amazing to see these 2 legends opening up the way they did in this video. I can’t wait to see all the new content they make together🙏🔥
😊😊😊😊😊
Wow.... I never thought you guys would be back, and seeing you guys together again actually brings a beautiful nostalgia, even here in Mexico we're excited to see you both again. 🇲🇽 I had to subscribe again. Can't wait to see whats new.
Food battle??
If someone had told me a few years ago that Anthony would rejoin Smosh, I'd have thought they were naive
Half the existence of smosh is because Ian’s mom wrote Anthony a letter lmfao
My brother told to just type in smosh in youtube and i saw these new videos.
Joven, Mari, lasercorn, sohinki, Wes, and flitz. We need a smosh reunite
So happy for you guys. Can't wait to see what's next! 😄
When’s the ‘I spent a day with Ian Hecox’s mom’
I cried at like 4 different parts of this video, I cannot even express how happy it makes me you two rekindled your friendship and reclaimed your whole empire and I cannot wait to see what's to come! I always thought that was the hardest part of Anthony leaving initially, was knowing your guys' friendship had been damaged. Like even if you didn't end up agreeing to rebuy Smosh or start comedy again, I'd have thought it enough if you two were at least able to save what was such a meaningful friendship! So the fact you did both is all the better.
So iconic
Breaking bad story
I crieddddd 😭😭😭
Its so nice to hear Anthony so excited about smosh again
bro i freaked out seeing this
The way this brings everyone so much closure
this is like healing my inner child
i want to see them both sit down with rhett & link and just talk about best friend + business partner experiences
personally loved the smosh movie
The guest we've ALL been waiting for!
no FAWKING way
Not to aid and abet the problem but i do hope these interviews still exist in some capacity, I'm sure this is a lot more than just an 30-hour interview, even if its just cameras rolling for that. Thats not including research, brainstorming best questions, time tables, setting up, taking down, etc. But you do, do amazing interviews with humanity
Ian is Bored the second?
SHUT UP
I feel like Ian has matured a lot. It was clear from this interview that he didn't really know what to do when Defy started to grow bigger and bigger, and he just went through the motions. And that's no fault for him at all. I mean, what are you supposed to do? It's really amazing to me that Anthony left. It just shows the kind of person he is. Ian is more conservative and Anthony is more willing to just drop something once it starts going bad. Just two different people more than anything. You two seem like you're in an amazing position right now. Two truly brilliant comedians that have gone through the god damn ringer. At this point, I think what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. You two have a great future ahead of you.
I just pooped my lederhosen!
Watching this feels like watching 2 people be therapists for each other, it's great
this feels like two exes just having therapy together, love to see how far the two of you have gotten!’
This feels like therapy
AHH MY CHILDHOOD!!!
You OWN SMOOOOSH AGAIN???!!!!!??!!!  F*CK YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!
37:57 Ian flexes on the haters
My mom has pancreatic cancer. I genuinely never thought that something of this magnitude would make me laugh or smile or cry tears of joy, because it’s been a hard few months. I’ve been watching Smosh since Easy Step and just seeing you two vibe together and have fun is healing a little piece of my anxious, broken heart. From a VERY longtime fan, I just don’t know that I’ll ever be able to adequately express just how thrilled I am for you guys, and how proud I am that you stuck through after all these years. The Smosh Renessaince - the Smoshaissance - is FINALLY here 🙌
It was never about the fancy expensive camera work or the crazy visuals with the edits, it was all about two hilarious bffs that would film each other acting out skits with a cheap camera. This was the Smosh that everyone and I fell inlove with. The creativity and simplicity was the core attributes for you both that created your amazing videos and my childhood memories ❤
I'm so happy about this video I remember watching you two while growing up. I'm so happy to see you guys with each other again.
been watching smosh since 2009, IM SO GLAD THEYRE BACK
IVE BEEN WAITIBG FOR THIS SINCE I SAW IT ON SNAPCHAT FINALLYYYY LETS GOOOO
I’m 34 now, I used to watch you guys on your own website. I’m so happy for you both! I’m glad you’re both happy & well.  Welcome back ☺️
This one is over an hour long   I think there might be a slight bit of favouritism going on here
NOT A MILK FIC REFERENCE WHAT THE FUCUKKK 🏃
I had never though that I’d see the day that they’d be together again, I grew up watching them and the laughter and enjoyment they gave me was incredible. I am so happy that I get to enjoy that again. I love Ian and Anthony ❤
We need more of blank we’re real
I'm so glad they own Smosh again, oh my god, I'm so emotional 😭✨
"Ahh yes, Food Battle 2023, truly the best Smosh sketch." - Everyone in 2030
Finally
This is a ploy to make smosh: the movie 2
FOOD BATTLE!!!!!!!!
These two are the exact dynamic that "if you love it, let it go. If it's meant to be it'll come back" was said about. Pure platonic soul mates ❤
I needed this
my childhood 🥺
This is insane but can we talk about how good Ian looks ! 🤩
anthony and ian, i’m gonna be honest, i haven’t been keeping up with either of you as much, i’ll watch a video of yours and one of smosh but i haven’t really been as connected to either of you but when i saw on twitter you guys bought smosh back i teared up and i don’t even know why, i was so happy for the both of you. i’m glad my childhood heroes are back for the future generation.
not the milk fic
beef n go
I did not realise this vid was an hour and 13mins. I genuinely got so immersed, I could listen to them for HOURS. They were the very first people I saw on the internet when I was just a kid. It’s amazing seeeing them grow together all these years later
when anthony said he needs our help to keep them going I immediately reached for my wallet I will pay any amount of money for smosh to be back
I know he said they’re not gonna do old content just nods to the old stuff but I stg if we don’t get a food battle 2023 I’m not gonna buy a membership
I didnt expect this but im so happy
Anthony: "We werent exactly best of friends"  Ian: talking and reading anthony like a book and old friends.   Its good to see them actually talking it out and thats the first step of being friends again communicating and being real with each other.
YouTube history right here.
My inner child needed this tonight.❤
I 🥺 LOVE 🥺YOU 🥺GUYS 🥺🩷
I feel like the world just got a tiny bit more repaired
All my dreams have come true🙏🙏
The next smosh video needs to food wars 2023‼️‼️
This is FUCKING AMAZING!!!😭
That low hug was so funny. It gives me hope
So crazy these dudes came out of my hometown
FINALLY! 😁
Gonna message some of my old friends. This shit is inspiring
Ohh Dios ohh Dios está pasando. Lo veré en inglés aún que no sepa mucho
It’s surreal to still be watching these two in 2023. I’ve been watching since I was in the 2nd grade, slowly but surely becoming obsessed with every element of YouTube—these two contributed massively to that. The grassroots, the production progression, the business of it, the evolution and devolution of Smosh as a brand, and now, til this day, they’re accomplishing firsts in the space. It’s insane, man. Still remember the day they hit 100k, have the Gold #1 Badge, and the day they hit 1mil a few months (weeks?) after FRED. Time flies. Over 17 years of watching Smosh. Congrats, guys!
I'm so happy you guys are back. I loved smosh when I was little and this is probably the best outcome anyone could want.
Less go
emotional moment  "I'm starting an only fans"--Ian   "I would sub just to support you"--Antony  "pls don't start the fanfict again"--also Antony
Legends Reunited!  Hope you guys have fun while doing the new sketchs!
And so the internet begins to heal ❤
Finally 😭
Chanse is probably so confused rn
smosh and ians mom are back i miss this
the collective groan heard around the world as ian brings up the milk fic
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSS
I didn’t know Mykie was such a good influence on Anthony It makes me really happy for them 🥹
I remember begging my mom to rent the smosh movie, I’ll never forget it lmao it’s probably my best purchase
So grab ya girl and get some Dixon cider  Ya find ya girl and get some Dixon ciderrr Get her grandma get some Dixon cider  Pour the stuff all down inside her
Goes to show that even in yours 30s you can have character development to heal decade old wounds! Props to Rhett & Link for being genuinely awesome!
No longer a reason to beat yourselves up for the Defy fiasco. You were young and lesson learned. While I love that Mythical stepped up to give Smosh a home, there was always something missing without Anthony - like the peanut butter missing the jelly. I am so happy for everyone at Smosh that the channel is back where it belongs. Love you guys!!! <3
Here before 30,000,000 views
i remember leaving a comment years ago on the video of anthony leaving, pretty much yearning for something like this to happen. i look back on that comment and cringe a bit now. i don’t think i really understood what was going on or how people change, but since then i’ve grown up, and i’ve watched anthony’s content evolve. this moment of reconnection and ultimate fulfillment of what i wished for when i was younger is indescribable. i’m so happy for you both and genuinely can’t wait to see what’s next
I want lunchtime with smosh
I love Smosh. Best wishes from Romania! 🥰
Words cannot explain
I literally just wondering why Ian hasn't been in this series and now we got this. Can't wait for the new smosh.
anthony got cake ooooh
Such a nice video. Smosh, alongside with many early creators helped me a lot to improve my English skill and better understand slang, the culture, people through their content. Forever grateful for that. Also, many of those channels are long gone, but it's really nice to see how Smosh reiterated itself to stay relevant, funny, and added on new people to the roster, who are just as amazing as these two.
The Internet just exhaled after however many years. I love you guys and I don’t even know Anthony.I can’t wait for all the new sketches inevitably roasting his tattoos
i love you guys :')
:’) 🎉
Sketch comedy isn't dead on YouTube, and does make sense for some people. It just depends on how you do it. Though I agree that it doesn't really work for Smosh.
Does this mean food battle is coming back??
This is proof that the internet is healing
There's no better example of platonic soulmates than these 2. The break in their friendship and everything just makes it an even stronger bond
the story about the “get well soon” card really resonated with me. something that really puts the idea of life/reality being subjective into perspective is how two people can walk away from the exact same event feeling entirely different from one another. for one person involved, that situation could create a core memory that stays with them until they die. for the other, its just like any other day and gets lost in a forest of other thoughts and memories. reminds me of that one movie quote thats like “(certain event i cant remember) was the most important day of your life. but for me, it was tuesday.” sometimes i get very hung up on thinking about these interactions and how i might be perceived.
We needed this so much.
Happy Birthday Boxman
yesss i knew youd do an interview with ian im SO GLAD
A surprise, but a welcome one
SMOSH together again  :O
"If we burn it to the ground I'm happy to do it with you"  I will cry  anyway we have grown past the need to kill the gfs. the gfs should date and then THEY CAN!
So cool
This warmed my heart so much! It gives me hope that things do get better. Even if it takes a few years. It’s be a long time since I’ve seen Smosh, but I still remember when they made their own content together. I’m so happy for them!!
It’s crazy Anthony. You two were one of the main reasons why me and my best friend even became friends in the first place. We connected through your videos and to see this today, I don’t know if I’ve ever cried happy tears like this in years man. Congratulations to you two💗
lol i loved the smosh movie
I was worried they would call Smosh the movie bad. But I liked Smosh the movie😟 it's a good memory from when I was younger
Probably the best ever to happened in 2023
holy shit
The last quote.... "I don't mind burning it to the ground with you" Damn that was so touching man wtfff 🥹
Took you long enough
I remember that movie pretty bad but I enjoyed it
This feels more like the history of ian and anthony rather an interview with ian hecox
ugh, my heart and my eyes! 😭i'm so happy for you both! 🖤
The boys are back in back in town!
the assassins creed and link outfits were stolen in a riot LMAOAOAKA
Clicked IMMEDIATELY. Liked IMMEDIATELY
Ohh boy this is gonna be a treat
i love you guys so much. i grew up watching you two.... wishing you both the best of luck!!
Ian and Anthony together are legendary, they made history by creating Smosh in 2005, glad to see them vibe
Amazing and wholesome from start to finish.   But you had to reopen old scars by bringing up the milk fanfic.  I fully support you both and will relish in this new era and the possible burning down of smosh.
I am crying over this. I can’t even believe it. I’m 25 and I loved watching you two in smosh. I still remember the day I saw Anthony announce that he was leaving. I haven’t really kept up with smosh since I got older and my interests changed but I’ve kept following Anthony’s channel. I love it and I hope he continues to work in this channel as well!
The most iconic thing to come out of 2023
Are going to do Food Battles?????
Wow. Thank you for allowing us into this conversation guys. You really are apart of millions of peoples childhood memories. Thank you for bringing us back. Much love to you guys!
SMOSH returning feels like a homecoming for Classic YouTube in a way. Anthony and Ian literally paved the way for what a Modern YouTube Career would look like, and so many people with YouTube and internet jobs wouldn't be here without them.  Welcome Back!
The whiplash between tearing up from "I'm happy to do it with you" to being reminded of the milk fanfic is weirdly nostalgic. I'm glad to see these guys back together again, hopefully with less milk and more cider
Im insanely excited to see what you guys do
MAKE SMOSH GREAT AGAIN!
I'm soo glad Anthony is back at Smosh. Not only that, Ian and Anthony own it now/got it back. Not only they announce it on the day of my birthday is even better gift that i could receive. I miss Anthony in smosh and I'm glad he is back. Can't wait for more funny videos from you guys you will do in the future.
the way they talk reminds me of a podcast, id 100% love to listen in on these two talking for hours edit: I said this 6 mins in without realizing this video is an hour long, I still stand by what I said   I CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT YALL HAVE PLANNED FOR SMOSHHH
Holy shit, the way you read each other its like you’ve actually been married, and by the interview you guys had you were married, divorced, and are now dating again, its such a special bond to have a friend like that, for real….
I just got my childhood back😊🎉
It’s so nice to see, that they have loved Smosh so much even to this day. To the point that they still cared enough to want to buy it back. Congratulations Ian and Anthony, what a duo!
food battle will always be one of my favorites <3 congrats guys<3
this made me extra emotional bc my bestfriend & i became besties in a similar way. it was 6th grade, we were partnered up in a class & immediately clicked & were inseparable. then as we got older things changed. we are still friends but more from afar. it makes me happy to see you two rekindling
Rhett and link the real goats
SCREAMING CRYINT THROWING UP EVERYWHERE
So... no foodbattle?
I'm so happy! And the fact that Rhett and Link are such a supportive force in this reunification being a possibility??? Couldn't be more perfect 🥹
there was a time when i was 12 or so  when i would hover over the search bar on youtube thinking about what i wanted to watch, my hands would kinda automatically type 'smosh' into the keyboard as just the first thing that came to my mind cuz thats how frequently id watch yall guys' stuff ;)... thx alot for being such a cherished part of my childhood, would rather have you guys and Ryan as role models for younger kids than what we have these days
So happy they are back these legends are going to dominate YouTube once again!
This was such a great video. I was a big fan of Smosh back in the day, and even though I realized that it might be right for Anthony to leave at the time, it still felt really sad that an era ended. Even though I didn't know you, I also felt sad for you guys because it seemed like you drifted apart. I'm thankful that you shared your story now, and I'm happy to hear that you've come to a lot of insights and feel at peace now. That you're starting working together again, is something I would never think would happen again. Congratulations to getting back Smosh and your restart! ❤
29:56 Wes and Fitz were definitely sent to get the alcohol 😭
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
I’ve been a fan for so long and I remember seeing the video where Anthony announced he left. Then watched defy go under. Then saw mythical buy Smosh. And now this !! This is so amazing I’m so glad I’ve stayed along for the ride
Damn I'm so excited! It's crazy to think that the first time I watched Smosh was like back in 2007
Seeing these two together again really brings tears to the eyes
I just wanna know where Anthony gets his jewerly from.... i want those rings and braclets
This is amazing. I'm so happy right now. BTW I loved your 2017 era Anthony ☺️
I just need to know if the food battles are coming back because I have my money on the donut
This makes me feel like i can rekindle a very similar friendship dynamic. Thanks for the video
The fact the Rhett and Link where genuinely excited for this and not even worried about the business end shows the kind hearted people and amazing people they are
I'm 22 now and I was one of those kids who probably shouldn't have been watching. This is exciting
gotta say I teared up hearing you guys got smosh back. I'm so glad you had the chance to grow and heal and find each other again. Best of luck at everything you ever do guys
i’m so happy i cried, cannot thank yall enough for this amazing decision. i absolutely love you guys
Your guys old videos inspired me to start my own channel
Rhett and Link are the freaking sweetest 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ya bésense!!! :D
Rhett and Link are the coolest people ever. Fucking love those guys. Super excited to see what you two do again. Never thought this day would come
Holyyyyy shittttt ballllssssss
I swear to god if food battles doesn't come back.
Yes
0:37 this already just radiats old smosh energy and im hyped for it
I was expecting this interview to be saved for a 10 million sub special
smosh needs anthony, im so happy
Thank you Ian and Anthony, I never thought this day would come, I’m so excited to see what comes next! And thank you Rhett and Link, for keeping Smosh safe between Defy ending and now. ❤
Ian and Anthony look like Punk and Preppy Boys became best friends
If someone tells you that life is not worth living, tell them that amazing and unexpected things like this can still happen only if you stick around.
As someone who found Smosh more recently, I appreciate the effort to make it accesible to all eras of fans. I'm excited to witness this new chapter 😊
Hi
I was wondering if this was gonna happen didn’t expect to come with this context
💙
Wait what’s going on?
w bro make smosh good dude no cringe shit just funny comedy its okay if some vids are ass dude but just remember the good days try ur best boys
This will be the catalyst to have some of the OGs back into YouTube.
oh no the milk has been mentioned 🥛🥛😂😂😂
The world is healing :')
I'M SO FUCKING HAPPY 😭😭😭😭😭
I live in Sacramento, and drive through dixion a lot and I constantly think about, listen to, and show everyone “Dixon Cider”
watching this while drunk, crying my eyhes out.
What an incredibly healthy discussion between friends. Smosh was my childhood and witnessing this reunion was so special! I’m excited to subscribe to the Smosh channel again. Thank you Ian and Anthony for making such an impact on so many people ❤
Bring Mari, lasercorn, sohinki and joven as guests?
I’d like to see/hear another “Where is Anthony?” joke in Smosh and then Anthony will finally appear! Hahahaha or at least a compilation of “Where is Anthony?” Joke and anthony making a big entrance haha
Pleasaseeee just make a video like the ones you guys used to make 😢😢
😺
I’ve realized that i have watch the rise peak fall and rebirth of one channel in my life time. i’ve grown up on it and i’m happy to say as much. I’m so excited to have smosh with these two again. True smosh
Yall werecmy childhood, this is everything i need and more! Excited to see the new videos!! Love youuuu!!!
Is Ian on the spectrum? I’m glad they are back together reconnecting. Ian yeah I’m not going to cry lol.
After Anthony doing all these therapy sessions it’s good to see him have one for himself. Glad to see the two of y’all together again
Anthony having HSP and being bedridden with it makes me feel less alone with having HSP, especially since it's still giving me flare ups 6 years since my diagnosis. It would be cool to see Anthony spend a day with people with/had HSP since it's relatively rare to hear about
What a fucking time to be alive
I just hope this makes them happy. Their videos made me laugh back in the day, they deserve the good stuff back to em
Younger me is sad that these 2 weren't always friends but adult me understands the harsh reality of it all too.
Will this channel merge with Smosh now?
anthony you got a dinky ass laugh
Smosh wasn't one of the channels that I watched a lot as a kid, but watching this now, it's so heartfelt and so real that I barely need the context. It's so touching. Even I can tell how close these two are
Christmas came early this year
Smosh got me through some lonely times as a kid. So stoked to see the boys back!
This makes me so nostalgic
FOOOOOOOODDDDDD WAAARRRRRRSSSS PLLEEEAASEEE
I completely forgot there was a SMOSH movie
Would this mean anthony is going to stop doing "I spent a day with". Im happy that smosh is back, but i also rlly enjoyed his solo content. Hope it sticks
FINALLY
Im not crying bro shut up
This 😢🥺🥺🥺💗💗💗💕💕💕
Legendary
This is such an amazing video for healing purpose !! Soo good !!
Finally
The kings of youtube are back!
so glad this exist, and so lovely to everyone on the same wavelength of teary eyed for their childhood
Holy fuckballs, they are back.🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What I love about this episode is that it’s less of an interview and more of a discussion - a long await sit down between two long-time friends and partners.  And I love that
I remember watching smosh and thinking that this easy could be a comedy central tv show aka a comedy empire. But og smosh will forever be the best YouTube age in my opinion.
yay
I was 1 when Smosh started. I only started watching a few years ago, so I don’t know what it feels like for those who’ve watched since the beginning, but this feels like two friends I’ve known for my a long time getting back together and getting along. I love it!!!!!
so were they best friends or were they just doing shit together because of youtube?
All the "Where's Anthony" jokes finally payed off
Sacramento ❤️
The Smosh movie was the first movie I ever bought
Ian you said at at about the 1 hour mark that you owe something to the community. You do not owe us anything. It has been a rough few years, but speaking for the community we have supported Smosh through the thick and the thin. We are so thankful to see you two reconnect, and with that you will foster brand new ideas that will ring true with both the new and old YouTube generation.
Ive never been a smosh fan growing up until 2016 where i discovered their channel and fell in love with it watching every old videos they had and was sad that anothony left smosh because ive only been a fan of smosh for a little bit before it all fell apart so im happy this video happened so i can watch smosh become alive again
Well definitely not the truth we were expecting but it's out! So I'm glad for you guys and love you smosh congrats ❤
I used to watch Smosh a lot in High school, especially when I was stressed for exams. Now finishing my bachelor thesis and these guys are getting back together. Feels like deja vu in a good way. ❤
i love all these iconic yt duos. the vlog brothers, rhett and link, ian and anthony, felix and the bridge...
it's crazy to think that we're only 3 years away from there being whole grown adults who are younger than youtube
I've watched you guys ever since when I was a young kid, its so nice to see you both together in 2023 and its very sweet to see you both still best friends :)
Wow this is so exciting!!! So happy for you both 🎉
Remember back in the day when I used to anxiously waiting for the next episode of Food Battle
After hearing the news on 6/20/‘23, I’m extremely excited for all of y’all. As someone who has grown up on Smosh, I can’t help but get giddy seeing these two on my screen getting along again. There are definitely a few skepticism that come up after a break like this, for fans, the crew, and the duo alike, but it really feels like the beginning of a truly healing era.   Smosh was there for me when my folks got divorced, and after a few years my parents developed a better friendship and are wonderful co-parents. This development, while not the same at all being how parasocial it is, bodes really well for the relationship of my YouTube dads
😭😭😭 I love u guys so much ❤❤❤❤
Anthony usually does a good job keeping it professional but this interview felt really personal and more like a therapy session  I’m glad Anthony and Ian can open up like this and rekindle their relationship after so long
This is an incredibly touching video but i need someone to tell me what the milk fanfic is 😂
What's the milk fic? Is it better or worse than D&P skin fic?
Beautiful episode ❤
Best news of 2023 ❤ My tears are coming out. Bless you guys and looking forward for the content!
As someone who started watching Smosh in 2006/2007, I'm honestly more happy about them rekindling their friendship more than anything else. These guys are the best of friends, man. That's so important.
this was genuinely so healing to watch, i feel like im reconnecting with my inner child lol
This is amazing guys, a new era is coming and you both deserve to reconect as friends, hope the best for you and the channel 💙✨
This was very much needed…to let it all out to grow.
This is honestly more exciting than Christmas wtf
omg its here les goooo
We're winning, bois The best of friends are back!
That, "Uhhhh, whaaaat?" was way too accurate of a blended impression of Rhett and Link LOL 1:03:17
I knew this was coming I knew this was coming I knew this was coming I knew this was coming Deep down I knew this was coming
My question is what will happen here?
Ian and Anthony are getting back together hoot!
ONE HOUR?!?!?!?
I wish cried during this interview. This is the best thing that's happened for me in a long while and so excited to see what they're going to do and make. ❤️
Anthony and ian is smosh. But i agree with anthony that Ian created smosh. He is the foundation. He stuck through rough times. Props to Shayne, courtney, keith, noah and olivia that carried smosh and made them still relevant over the years.
I’m so happy to see you both together I remember the “shut up” intro and the Pokémon vids thank u for amazing childhood 🩵🩵🩵
Such a great example of open conversation between friends.   Boxman ran for president before he went to therapy. And now boxman is finally back as presidents of SMOSH.  So excited for you guys! Been watching since food battle 2006
I love
Finally, the next Food Battle.
MY PARENTS ARE BACK TOGETHER (I am 30)
This is some really beautiful open stuff. Very settling and lovely and honest
I’m so happy for this
I was a little kid when I watched smosh heard theories and rumors that Ian and Anthony weren't friends but never believed it but to hear them admit their friendship took a massive hit is really interesting putting things into a new light lol
This feels like a divorced mom and dad finding peace with each other and becoming friends again
For the record I loved smosh the movie😂🔥
im a member your welcome
Not the milk, dont bring up the milk
I'm so happy right now. <3
seriously?? i dont even care if they even do anything with the Smosh brand, im just glad that they own it again.
This is a way better reunion than Drake and Josh. 😂 y’all seem genuine.
Kings are back !!!
I’m so excited for the new video, I’m glad to see that they seem excited and open about doing this again!!
Good to know that this series is still going, and to see Ian on this channel
Let’s see if Kalyan and Weston watch this
Weee
The world is healing. Now I need "Ian is Bored" to come back man...
I’m filled with so much joy I can’t stop smiling AAAAA
All I can think of is Rhett and Link making a whole video of them digging a medium sized hole… and I loved it.    Im excited for new Smosh.  This is the reboot to friendship and good content.
The boys who made YouTube YouTube
i for one, enjoyed the smosh movie.
YouTube history right here
I’ve had a shitty day and this is exactly what I needed right now I’ve been waiting for 3 years  The day has finally come
The part where Anthony almost cry telling how he realised that his childhood friend (Ian) is still here when they reconnecting back after years of being apart...it got me great 😢
oh god I knew the bloopers were coming and I knew exactly where it was going 😭 I’m so sorry on behalf of those writers for traumatizing y’all 😭 new smoshers, do NOT go looking for that one PLEASE 🙅‍♀️
Excited for this new chapter with Smosh, Anthony, Ian, and everyone past, present, and future. Its your time. As a fellow creative, own it, create it, and do what make yall happy. Thrive and excited for future content.
i'm not even a fan but seeing the news and this, kinda puts a smile on my face, and maybe a bit of tears...
Greatest crossover ever
I imagine daddy Shayne breaking things in that Defy office 😂😂😂 another banger
as an old time smosh/patd fan... did not realise the milk fic had spread to smosh slash. now regret looking it up to confirm if it's THAT milk fic.
this is like if John Lennon and Paul Mccartney got over their issues and started making music together again
"Cyberspace celebrities" didn't know they were called like that back then
This is bringing my childhood back
i really appreciate this video. i grew up with smosh in my middle school years until my early high school years.   to see their growth is beautiful and it also gives me some sort of "reason" to acknowledge my own growth. i love y'all :3
WHAT THIS IS CRAZY YES
The fact that this is so incredibly raw is absolutely amazing. You can tell that they're just happy to he together again. It's amazing to see how much they've grown<33
Now get Ryan Higa back on his channel.
“Oh, Anthony spends a day with Smosh.” … “Wait, ANTHONY SPENDS A DAY WITH SMOSH?!!!”
This made me miss my old bff
Bitchhhhh I would watch them since I was in Elementary and now I’m a whole 25 yo woman 😭😭😭 so happy to see them together again
Ian, you’re both the hot one, geez
All is right in the world today
The new video should have anthony and ian have their old haircuts
I’M GOING TO THE SAME COLLEGE AS THEM RN LOLL
Gg
Me, a 32 year old lady getting emotional.
This was not on my 2023 bingo card 😅
You two have such a way with words. I've never heard a better description of what it means to become an adult than "the things that make you laugh change, and the things you want to do change." I'm glad you're both in a better place now.
i wonder who pissed on the desk
This is amazing. Sometimes I forget that Anthony is the Anthony from Smosh. He’s grown so much and seems like a different person.
Okay but why couldn't we mention Box Man? A YouTube gem 💎 📦
ANTHONY PADILDO AND IAN HECOCKS IN THE SAME ROOM!!! YAAAAAA!!!!
Its so funny i'm reading the comments that people ALL feel the same way  that we entered a weird time warp for a while and still going where we are in the wrong timeline and to hear people say "we are back in the good official timeline" with their whole chest because of this announcement is so interesting to me. Like we all know on a spiritual level something big went wrong yet people can't put their finger on it, Like society started to believe in the supernatural all at once  without saying it haha it should be a social commentary
I feel Ian is only just at the start of learning himself here. He is still very guarded about his honest feelings where as with Anthony you can see he has already gone through that crazy strong self discovery. I love the both of them wholeheartedly and wish them the best in everything that comes.
i havent watched fully , im halfway through (i have an exam) But holy god this is such a shock and im all for it,  i love it, best of luck n all
I can’t wait for another lunchtime with Smosh
Now that Anthony is back they need to do another Ian interviews his exes hahaha
Our childhood is coming back baby
Oh man smosh was the reason i got into writing, its so good seeing them again
Smosh was my 2012
no way!!! finally :D
30:49 And didn’t Defy steal and/or lose a lot of money for a lot of channels?
It feels like traveling though time…
My eyes popped out soon as I saw the thumbnail
Thank you both for everything. You were a big part of my life as a child and now you remain a bigger part of my life as an adult. Thank you so much for everything
I think Ian would cringe at this but I hope you both realise that this video is culturally significant, if not potentially historically significant. You two in this new place in your lives could make something amazing and more than comfort your fans, deeply positively impact them.  From just this video, documenting the progession and maturing of your friendship, you're setting a fantastic example.  Edit: historical because of the impact a freidnshup like theres, available and I'd assume accurately portrayed based on the values of Anthony's channel. They have a chance to do something huge with this. And positively impact even more people's lives. Learning a more sustainable, realistic but ultimately sound and positive world view isn't an insignificant thing. And I fully believe it could make a big enough impact through this apocalyptic nightmare we all live in, that it could even (at the most) have a historical impact. Even if that's sort of soul crushing because the internet is generally hated for relatively good reasons.
I love how mature this heart-to-heart is <3
Que grande ver estos dos otra vez
No way! Congrats! I used to binge watch all you guys' old videos! I miss it! I couldn't wait for the next dumb video to come out. Lol
Literally my childhood and what a time it was back then of the early days of Smosh. The legends are finally back, like the amount of influence these legends had on our childhood was literally heartfelt, like so many emotions man. Really happy, and in joy, that they managed to buy it back. Now they're back together, now Smosh is back together and so will all of us OGs from the early days/years of Smosh, all there skits, food battles and more after all these years. Literally getting so many memories from my childhood of them.   Like this video literally reminds me of Smosh's second channel at the time, or when Ian use to do, Ian is bored where he'd talk, open fan mail with Anthony & much more.  🥺💙
My inside child is buzzing, now that smosh are back together
WILL YOU BRING BACK THE OLD SMOSH GAMES CREW???
hope they kiss in this one
I’m so happy this happened. It is kinda emotional hearing what’s actually happened and how they’ve felt but I’m glad to hear the full truth  I always said if they came back together, their inner child would come out and it does They’ve both matured and changed but that’s not a bad thing, i think it’s necessary  I love these guys
Internet legends! ❤️
LEGENDARY✝️
Ian and Anthony have learned the power of: ~✨communication✨~  (Okay but I’m also super excited lol, hoping for the best 🤞❤️)
Its pretty awkward to interview ian as a stranger. But yeah congrats for the smosh purchase 🎉🎉
Food Battle 2023!?
Holy shit Ian aged 10 years
dude Smosh carried my preteens and teens for so many years it feels so good to see you guys together on camera again now as an adult
Yeahhh the boys are back!
24:54  Straight Facts~
I also recently had a good friend come back into my life after years apart and it's been one of the biggest blessings. I am extremely happy for you both and can't wait to see what you guys create~
amazing video. i’ve missed you guys so much, and i’m so looking forward to the future of smosh. a part of me is healing
can't believe the original youtubers duo are back in action.
Rhett and Link are amazing people.
IM SO SO EXCITED!! I can’t wait to see what’s coming!!
I never watched Smosh as a kid, probably just a few videos but this is still exciting to me and it's surreal seeing Ian and Anthony together
I was listening to this ep on Spotify bc i was at school and honestly i nearly cried on the bus when i heard you guys hug near the end of it. You guys have been my childhood since well a long time and yes i may not be the biggest og fan bc i havent been alive for as long as you guys have been doing YouTube but i have watched you since i was incredibly young. I watched the old vids and watched the new and i love both. Am so so so grateful for you guys, you have been my favourite duo for so long and have helped me through many hard times. The world is healing, thank you ❤
its so wild seeing smosh return, never would I think this would've happened
This will mark in history
Smosh has been a part of my life for like 15-16 years and I have enjoyed every era of it in some way. I’m so happy to see this equilibrium being reached, it feels like a shift in the universe or something.
I remember sending you guys mail during "Ian is Bored" over a decade ago now... growing up watching you guys kept me sane lol. I'm SO glad to see you two making stuff together again!
I remember starting to watch smosh at smosh at the beach 2. Crazy to see all the growth and wild stuff smosh has been through
So excited for both of them. Ian's patience and perseverance against all odds and Anthony's self preservation and self reflection really made them grow in their own way.  They overcame a mountain of experiences and challenges of their own and have somehow found their way back. That's some great anime character arcs right there! Excited to see what's to come.
This genuinely makes me want to reach out to my childhood bestie. I miss you Sydney ❤️‍🩹
HOLY SHIT ITS HAPPENINGGGGG
These two mature, capable, vulnerable men are valuable role models for young men to learn from
I cried 4 times watching this!!!! 😭😭😭😭 so fucking stoked to see the future of Smosh!!!!!
Honestly if I can just see a food battle 2023 I’ll become a member
As a big Smosh fan, This made me tears of joy. I’m crying that is happening  I knew smosh since I was in 4th or 5th grade now I’m 18 graduating high school.  Time does really fly.
A dream come true❤
I’m hoping to see food battle 2023!!!!
Have fun you two. I know that whoever you two do it’ll be great
This feels unreal...  There's so much going to shit everywhere else and now Smosh are back together.. I'm almost afraid something will go wrong
It's just so surreal seeing Ian and Anthony back together. I actually thought they had grown apart for so long and that they were both happy where they were.  To see this, now that they're both 35 and have needed to grow up apart from each other for a bit, to see that they're still the same teens underneath is so damn heartwarming!  I can actually see so much of their younger selves in who they are now. It's so uncanny, but I see it.  My god I'm so excited to see them acting together again!
i remember clicking through the website on my flip phone 24/7
Holy shi! This is crazy hyped af
I loved Smosh growing up and I can’t wait for the Classic Smosh to return however, not to bring negativity or anything, I’m a bit concerned with Anthony’s return to the comedic scene. I love and watch almost all of his interviews and it showed me how much he matured and became more serious in his content. Ian on the other hand grew with the smosh channel diverging into the more nonsensical and more random type of content. I have a feeling that the quirks we loved from their sketches wouldn’t be the same as they did back then. Again, this isn’t a comment for hate but for concern. Still, looking forward to the future of Smosh and what Ian and Anthony have for their return 🙏🏻
I loved this so much! I laughed so hard I snorted when Ian was talking about the fanfic, the kissing noise was hilarious that I couldn’t breathe 😂 I love that they are doing classic Smosh again. I’m so excited for them!
And that's called growth
It feels like I gained back a part of my youth, a part I didn’t know that wanted to come back but I am welcoming it with open arms <3
Estos dos sujetos formaron gran parte de mi infancia, qué emoción que hayan logrado reconectar!
Congratulations on Smosh! I hope you all bring together what makes everyone shine. This format is so refreshing and real amongst other YouTube gotcha formats so I really hope it keeps going!
the first time i saw smosh was over someone’s shoulder on a library computer when i was 8.  i’m 23 now and seeing anthony and ian reconnect is giving me some immaculate nostalgia and makes me take a second to appreciate how much i, they, and youtube have changed since then. it’s been a wild ride
ian also has cold sores on his left eye. look at his eye lid
I miss them so much
17 years ago? Damn, next year Smosh will be able to vote and take out a student load!
Burn it to the ground!
SMOSH IS BACK BABY!!!!!!!!
Please, trust you have our support 🙏
The legends are back, I don't think people remember how much of an influence these legends had, What a time it was, Glad you managed to buy it back legends , This eposide literally reminds me of the Smosh second channel 👑🙌
They even build off eachother in general conversation lol. It's great to just watch two friends talk
This is the second best thing to ever happen in my life
Everything works out for us!
Anthony coming back is like the rare case of dad bring back the milk 😂
weird seeing these two in the same room again
I never clicked on a video so fast
thank you guys
This… is the moment I’ve been waiting for
reality is healing
WELL HOT DOG IT'S A NEW ERA OF ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT
I almost cried
Im not crying i swear 🫠😭 this is wholesome✨
this will be the ending of the smosh biopic
This kind of conversation is what happens when two bros have time to break their walls down. What they have is more of a brotherhood than a friendship
OH SHIT
You could do a podcasts together you have great synergy
need more charlie the drunk guinea pig
Bro, I was 11 when I first started watching Smosh. They were so funny and memorable. When Anthony and Ian went on their separate paths, I was pretty sad. It was the end of an era.   That kid who grew up watching these guys probably never imagined that they would see these two together again.
"That was a little cringe"  lmaoo
you say not to make fanfictions again but the beauty of this entire dialouge was as if taken straight out of the deepest and most intricate fanfic of all time
After all these years we finally got that hour long special where they talk and not just walk
These guys and vat19 were my childhood bruh
So, @AnthonyPadilla, level with us on one thing - when you say Smosh Main will be back to before....are we Thanos-snapping Arasha, Angela, Tommy, Chance, Amanda, Kimmy, Jackie, and the rest?
SHUT UP
I am so happy for both Ian and Anthony.  Able to reconnect like this.  My childhood friend and I had a falling out, and we reconnected as well unfortunately our reconnect story has a sad ending as he passed away.  But I am glad we made amends and we  hung out till his passing.  It seemed like the old days just older 😆.  He also introduced me to Smosh and all the wonderful cast of talented people.  Love you guys and here's to the next chapter in smosh!!  🍻 👏 ✌️
Nature is healing 🙏🏻
It’s honestly amazing to see Ian and Anthony together again, these guys were a big part of my childhood and sense of humor, it’s just great to see this happening.
Congrats dudes. I'm excited for this, brings back memories. I an't wait to see what you bring back as the OWNERS of Smosh again. I'm happy for your friendship too, drifting apart is always hard, and that honestly is the most important thing to be fixed. Good luck and may you have a great time!! I know I will.
Ian: someone’s gonna write a fanfick and make us kiss afterwards Anthony in his head: it’s him, he’s gonna do it
I didn't realize it but Ian truthfully does look better this past year, and I didn't know why, and now we know why. He got his best friend back.
I don't wanna believe that there is kids and teens nowdays who never watched the OG Smosh ;-;
ive always watched smosh to get distracted from my trauma as a child, you 2 literally got me through the bad days nd growing up with you guys was something i will never forget, just seeing new smosh videos in the past being posted always lit up my day. and even if you guys separated i still watched yall grow up. but now that this has happened..i cannot stop smiling my inner child is crazy proud of yall. this is history right here.
The fact that you two INSTANTLY clicked when writing sketches again is absolutely fantastic:'D
I haven’t stopped watching smosh since 2012 and I’m so happy about this. The main channel hasn’t been what i look for with smosh since the beginning of the pandemic and I’m really excited about going back to classic smosh. Initially I was as skeptical as they were about this working but the fact they felt that too, and then were so sure that it was going to work has got me feeling good. Even before the pandemic the moment every blank Evers started appearing I was a little weirded out at the main channel production flow. I’m hoping they focus on the original character dynamic between them where Anthony is the self conscious person hiding behind a vail of angst and coolness while Ian is the one whos so oblivious he doesn’t care about sharing the things he loves, there’s a lot of interesting conflict they used to do with that. Eventually the dynamic switched to Anthony being the vulnerable vegan person and Ian just sort of became the stupid one, I wasn’t really feeling that version and it’s what got me invested with the new cast side of things. Anyway I’ll be waiting patiently for that first sketch.
this is unreal
HOLLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What about this channel? Will it still continue?
I saw a clip of the interview with matpat, looked up the 1 hour long special April fools video, and this was recommended, thank god it was
smosh was an absolute life changer for me back in the mid-late 2000s and i will always be grateful that you guys exist. you guys have impacted the world in such a positive way that seeing this friendship rekindle is like watching an ecosystem regrow itself. no matter what smosh shapes up to be from now on, i know i'm just happy to see my two biggest early youtube inspirations at peace with one another and friends again. i wish for nothing but the absolute best for you guys and i can't wait to see what the future holds
Weirdly ian was the more normal one here and his answers kinda felt too boring Honestly i expected them to both scream shut up when it started 😂
FOOD BATTLE 2023!!!!
You can tell that the last comment made by ian hit Anthony in the feels
ian and anthony!! i was honestly wondering how anthony was holding up with not having as creative of an outlet anymore 🥲
This felt so raw, surprised they released this
Wait what? Lip sync videos were the first to pop off? Maybe we didn't change.
So much of my childhood memories are coming back to me all at once
HEY
This is a Masterclass in Wholesome Men Being Men
smosh duo on trash taste. let's do it!
I actually really liked smosh the movie and I watched it probably 10 times as a kid
it's amazing to see these two evolve from goofballs into these self-reflecting, level-headed adults. A difficult and meaningful journey, proud of you guys, we love you.
I remember watching food battle when I was young, and I also remember the day the AC3 rap came out. It takes me back to a simpler time. I remember the computer in the hallway of my house, and I was always watching Smosh. It’s so great to see you guys together again and finally having control of everything again. ❤
When they said kids were the only ones that would be watching YouTube, they were right as one of those kids that watched almost everything on YouTube everyday
im 21 now i was watching u in 2008  shits crazy i love yall
CYBERSPACE CELEBRITIES 😂
I'm so happy to see you guys working together again. It's beautiful to see the growth you guys did and I can't wait to see what's next!
Wow never thought I would see this happen. I'm really happy for you guys and I can't wait to see the new content you guys put together 🎉
molester moon goated video
omg
I can’t believe my dads are getting back together
AM I DREAMING???!!!!!!!!??
so glad to see you guys back :') i feel like a child again :')
Did they see the Mario movie together or something I’m not crying
actually sobbing while watching this
HOLY SHIT
Soo happy for you both! Big W Rhett and Link for being so cool about everything!
Duuuuude.....❤
The comeback we all needed
WHAT THE HELL WILL YOU DO TO SMOSH??
I feel like we finally slipped back in to the right timeline
This is the culmination of a saga that I didn't realize I needed.
I never saw Smosh when the both of you were still together, But this video had me teary eyed and smiling the whole time. Congrats, guys, you're going to kill it, for sure!
I hope they bring back food battle
This is the sweetest ever. So beautiful to see friends reunite
This is so goddamn wholesome
I never thought I’d see the day 😂 Smosh was probably the first YouTube channel I subscribed to and I started watching it at 11. I’m 21 now. My friends, siblings and I would try to create our own skits like you guys and I still have some of the videos. They were so incredibly cringy.  I miss this era of YouTube so much. No ads, no censorship, complete creator freedom :(
Does this mean food battle is making a return?
I just missed smosh. Well it was still going on but I was too young to watch it. Was watching all the Minecraft videos but i do have some memories of secretly watching some videos. Kinda weird over a decade later seeing them again
Man I remember watching these guys when I was 13 years old and seeing these guys come back together really put a smile on my face
thats cool, now when does epic food battles coming back?
Can we get mail time and lunch time with Smosh back? Don't wanna make everything about making a video but you two were hilarious during those
I cried when I heard the news that you guys owm smosh again. I've be a fan sinve day 1 and was so sad when you left smosh.  I'm so happy to see you guys back together and the same old.  I love you guys, looking forward ti all the laughs you guys will bring to everyone again ❤
At 34:40 when Anthony starts talking about how his partner allowed him to open up and remove walls and actually let emotions out really connected with me because I've also had the same experience happen to me within the last 2 years and it really is a huge weight lifted off your back... I'm still breaking those habits now. So many issues can be solved if you just talk about it to someone, or even to yourself. It is really important to actually listen to your emotions
I'm a 26 year old who has grew up with YouTube, and to see Smosh come full circle is just perfect!!!!
omg-
Just look at how good our guys look all grown up!
This damn near made me cry, it’s so good to see them together again
My day has been made
How many fools can I kill today
This was a canon event 😊
this is the one Canon Event im Fine with
Holy shit, Smosh is back? Immediately resubscribed, it's been a long time.
It’s nice for Anthony and Ian to hang out again after all those years.
Even if Anthony was not coming back to Smosh, I was still expecting this video to be made.
I love how throughout the video you can tell there both at good places not only with Smosh but together because they kept on smiling at each other
It comes back full circle, Ian's "It's a stupid idea but, what if we own Smosh again?" and it worked out like a charm for Smosh
Lost for words! Congrats guys!
this is genuinely so cathartic??? idk if that's too strong of a word to use but seeing you guys hash out your feelings in such a chill way was just so soothing to watch. it made me so so happy. ❤
THE GOOD OLD SMOSH BUT WITH THERAPY
omg
I am so happy I'm crying!!!!
This video is gonna blow up so fast and it deserves to
Every year, I am checking a video like "I spent a day with Smosh" and this year, it finally happened lol
Wait, there was milk fanfic???😂😂
This is a canon event ladies and folks. Good timeline, here we come.
As someone who has watched Smosh since I probably 10 years old this video makes me feel so happy😊 my best friend and I used to watch Smosh videos together all the time
I grew up watching smosh. Glad you guys are coming back
Happy to see this happening. so excited
I'm so happy
nice
I don't think we all dont realize what has happened here. My home boys from 2007 Rhett and Link saved smosh and let them grow to the point of the return of Anthony P. Too buy the channel back. Like wtf. I am 33 years old and I find this more exciting than one piece ending. How ever I hope the companies still keep the characters together.
After all this time it is so great to see the smosh bros, the game bang guys, the smosh babies actors, the OG youtubers, the friends speak again
Damn Im gonna turn 29 in a few days, I remember when these ruled youtube back in late 2000s
omg they are back
FRIENDSHIP TRULY DOES ALWAYS WIN
Where can I find Ian’s shirt???
The thumbnail took my breath away! AAAAH!
I'm honestly still in shock
It’s been years since I had to deal with autocorrect trying to make me type Amish instead of smosh💀💀
You should do an interview with Zach Pincince!
The OG’s are back together!
This is so crazy. I feel like I’m hallucinating. So happy for you guys
I'd be more than trilled if their new brand becomes their squatting hug like R&L's handshake
This was a great therapy session 😍
I cannot wait to hear the iconic "SHUT UP!"
I am very late to all of this but what happended to smosh and Anthony leaving ?
thank you!
Good Mythical Morning owning smosh was like staying on your friends couch until you land back on your feet…    And while I love Rhett and Link,  All I can say is, I’m happy to see Smosh getting back on its feet again 🥲
Is it back to just being the two of them? Because that's what Smosh needs.
Literally my childhood
THE WORLD IS HEALING
Anthony, bring your emo hair back
Finally, -Osh.
FINALLY
This video was so refreshing to watch. I love both of them being completely honest and open with each other and listening and talking through their past both the positives and negatives. Absolutely loved this and am so excited for the class Smosh again!
Are the other Smosh pit members going to be on the main channel then or no? Is it just them ?
SHUT UP!
I was not really a fan of the comedy Smosh made. But goddamn did I love lunchtime with Smosh because it was purely these two guys hanging out and chatting and you could tell they were best friends
the outfits tho? they went from weird guys from across the street to "bad" boy who would show you around the city and daddy friend who you'd have great conversations with
This has me in the feels. I was a kid who grew up watching your videos and I’m a huge fan of Rhett & Link and I just am so thankful for all of you guys ❤
it’s wild how mature and well spoken they both are. i’m so ready for this new era
Food Battle 2023 🎉
crying
Regardless of being demonetized, they should recreate how they started.
“let’s burn this to the ground.” i love them
ALRIGHTY THEN!!!!!!!!!!!
I am really scared.   “It’s going to go well” 😢 please don’t die guys🙏
Beef n go 😩😩😩
not the milk fanfic 💀
This is part of new chapter of a YouTube history again.. I have been watching your channel since it was started.. Till how it ended then back again like it was how it started.. I love Anthony is back in the team, he is the funniest one I love to watch.. However I also hope you can continue this channel again, I love watching interviews from this channel too
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
This hits home for me, and it’s super cool you guys did this. Good shit as always, and it’s sick you guys own the majority of YOUR creation once again
I honestly liked SMOSH the movie
THEYRE BACK TO TALK AGAIN!!!
OMG FOOD BATTLE 2024!???!!!
If it wasn’t for that 6th grade science project, we’d never have smosh
Nostalgia be damned
I am actually really happy about you two being the owners of smosh again, back to the classics :)
My actual childhood
I wish the best for Ian, Anthony, and Smosh. Together or apart.
I want to hear Rhett and Link's take on this stuff. Glad they got together again.
This is infinity war type level crossover
I get this. When they started and received their identity it was a group identity and they needec to grow and separate for a bit to get their own personal identities. Kind of like identical twins.💓
Maybe there is hope for the future...
THIS IS HISTORY!
These guys kinda remind me of George Beard and Harold Hutchins
Can we laugh at how we all know anthony was thinking of Dan at 1:09:16
crazy that I start watching smosh again one week before this lmao
oh fuck as the new gen of smosh i might have to look up the milk fan fic
I can sing Charlie the drunk guinie pig by heart!!!
LET IAN TALK OMG
This was like watching a therapy session and I mean that in the most positive way. I love that you guys talked through everything. Here’s to a healthy repaired friendship and a blossoming new journey of creativity. ❤
“Dial up internet”. I still barely know what that means bc I was born in ‘03.
Butthole jokes will always be funny if you do it smart like you can't just say hey pull my finger and fart like Really try
I really wish you hadn't mentioned the mil fanfic...
The Smosh live (global) tour when? Please... 😅
Wow u guys literally met because of a landfill sketch. You realize how crazy that is. Literally.
Someone please tell me I’m not dreaming 😂
I'm so happy Smosh is back. The creativity and passion yall had was definitely what made the content amazing. I'm so excited to see what Smosh has coming for us :)
I wish Ian dressed like this all the time omg
Did enyone realize that there's music In the background!?
I love you guys thank you for everything you’ve done for my childhood and for making me happy and laugh much love you guys ❤❤❤
Ghetto Smosh
Full circle baby! I was here!
You two are trending on Google
“They’re now cyberspace celebrities” is such a bizarre thing to hear now. The world changed fast
By the way so incredible to see y'all being vulnerable and real like this..
It’s weird that I’d never thought these guys would do anything together ever again. It was not even in the universe of possibilities. Happy for them.
The old Smosh is a meme these days but it was a time where you could put whatever the creativity came to mind and not worry about who is going to be offended. I hope you keep that vibe. Good luck with the future and be happy and healthy. Comedy is made to make people laugh and enjoy the humor. Not everyone is going to like the same thing.
I am finally at peace
I'm gonna cry
ok this is crazy
The full circle is amazing.
The theme of today is nostalgia. Shout out to mia cole on perfect timing
Bro i remember seeing pokemon in real life when I was like 8 and believing it. There was also a video where there was a masturbation joke, where a character had white stuff all over him, but I didnt get it at the time lol
1:11:29 "Even if it doesn't do well, i know that this was the right thing, and if we burn it to the ground i am happy to do that with you" probably the most hard hitting and beautiful phrase i hear, do i wan to have the chance to say that to someone one day
This felt like lunchtime and mealtime with smoosh back in the day… imagine these were the type of conversations they were having in those videos
Amazing video
Godammit, I can't stop shitting. I tried taking imodium but it wont stop. I feel like im losing water
Imagine the new sketch comes out,  and everyone hates it. That would make all this hype that now exist be  turned into crushing disappointment. Everyone includes you, reader, btw.
Damn i actually asked for this a bit ago
They say you ether die a hero or live to be the villain...  Not super fitting, but its rather applicable to a lot of senecios. Though, with such a powerful rebond of friendship, maybe there really is an alternative to the classic saying...
Ahhhh I’m so happy for you guys and so happy you shared these moments with us thank you guys
this is great news although I do feel kinda bad for the people working at smosh. They're getting blindsided again.
The storyline that my childhood has been begging for has finally come to fruition… this is everything and more. I’m genuinely floored and crying happy tears. Congrats guys :)
THE RETURN
This is so incredible and nostalgic even tho I was born in 2003.
As a member of your original website, I am tearing up. I entered the box man dance competition, but my editing software wasn’t working so I posted a bunch of “video replies” of me tap dancing.
i fucking used to watch your pokemon music parody videos and the assassins creed three parody video is still legendary to me and my best friend to this day bro this actually made my day i literally was so down im just sitting in the dark rn hating my life and seeing this made me happy thanks bros damn i can’t believe this is happening i literally thought smosh was gone thank you genuinely you lifted my mood
Game Bang needs to come back
Congratulations on you both getting Smosh back! ♥️🥳🍾
does this mean one day maybe we’ll get a mail time with smosh again🥺😭 there is a god
Por fin las dos leyendas de youtube se reunieron saludos de México lo amo tanto
Somebody call me an amberlamp
I am just so happy to see that Ian and Anthony haven't changed, they've just grown up.
My childhood!
Seeing Ian happy makes me happy.
there's like an invisible string bringing them back together
I was waiting all these years for Anthony to interview Smosh, cant believe we got Smosh reunion instead 😭😭
This makes me so incredibly happy. Im so happy for you two! Also thank you to rhett and link for buying smosh if they never bought smosh this wouldnt have happened. Much love!! Ps. Dear god the milk fanfic  That gave me serious ptsd flashbacks LOL
Love you two guys! Welcome back bubs!
Cannot believe I began watching this duo when I was 12 years old and well over a decade later it has come full circle.  I know its not about looks but THEY HAVE AGED LIKE FOINE WOINE 🍷  So excited for yall and for the future.
It’s crazy people don’t know who smosh is 🤣🤣
i totally forgot that they worked together on smosh. wow, my brain cannot fathom these two being together in this video💕it’s so wild and wonderful💕
I hope Joven, Lasercorn, Sohinki, and Mari collab with Smosh now that Ian and Anthony own the company. I know the four are a part of oGSoG.
I was thinking Anthony gives super Virgo energy and reminds me of me a fellow Virgo googled his birthday and turns out yup Virgo 😂 so glad to see you guys together I’ve been watching since 2010
Does every iconic YouTube duo have an infamous milk fanfic?! (I only knew about the Phan one😭)
would have been epic if you did the friendship always wins bit when you high fived about owning smosh
I remember watching your videos religiously back in 2008 and I'm so happy to see this
I'm both excited and nervous about what there gonna do next after the have full control of smosh
This is like the No Way Home of Youtube videos!😆  The OGs Coming back after almost 2 decades!  Man, this is REALLY epic!
THIS VIDEO FEELS AMAZING
As a 23-year-old who felt like the odd one out watching in 2023, this healed my inner dumbass. Props to captivating our teenage selves and cheers to however many y’all continue to come up with. I enjoyed early sketch comedy Smosh, coming of age Smosh Pit, and now Smosh reborn. The perennial haters are irrelevant; welcome back!!!
Cried at the burn this thing to the ground together 😢
been a min since i seen Anthony and seen some of his a day with series but did get get tattotts on his arms and chest?
I NEED to know who pissed on the desk. My guess is either Shayne, Joven, Lasercorn, or someone who doesn't show up on camera a lot
Since you guys have Smosh again you guys should play Kinectimals again and check in on your black panther "F*cktard" although I know there's no way in hell you have a 360 or a kinect still.
Holy shit this is insane!
wow i live long enough to witness smosh reuniting 🥺
They're back
This is such a special video to me. My lifelong best friend and I also stopped talking around age 20 and I hoped we’d find our way back together like this. Unfortunately she passed away the following year and we never got the opportunity. We were both huge smosh fans growing up so I’m sure she’s smiling & celebrating this with me wherever she is
This is awesome! And what a beautiful story of growth, healing and relationships.
bro
NO FUCKING WAY
family therapy
This is like when Mike and Ike reunited.
I’m so glad you guys were able to get it back, grow apart, and come back together and be friends again. I’m excited for the future for both of you. ❤ I love both y’all for both channels and so much respect for what y’all created for 10+yrs. I’m really proud of you Anthony. And your growth and willing to let go. That says a lot about you! 👏 And Ian so proud of your growth as well. It took a lot for you I’m sure to go through all this.   Anthony are you keeping this channel still? I really hope so. Your so fantastic at it. ❤ As a YouTube creater who does interviews, I really admire you and your content. Man tears. 🥲. I understand how you feel so much Anthony. A resentment with the loss of a friend who you grow up with and reconnection with. Man I just felt for you. ❤ Thank you both for being so vulnerable.
i can tell this friendship is either still not real or will fall apart very quickly again... Ian still does not understand why Anthony had to leave for his mental health.
It’s about time. My childhood. I miss my preteen days. Discovered these guy when I was 11 thanks to my cousins since they were huge fans. I became a huge fan as well afterwards. Still miss the old days. Glad to see Ian & Anthony together in a video again.
You guys should do “reacting”/breakdowns on favorite videos from your classic library. Congratulations on getting the channel + friendship back!
Food fight 2023 when?
dude the way you can just tell they are still so fond of each other and when Anthony would start crying talking about sweet moments of their childhood ugh I’m so glad they found their way back to each other and are going to work together again :)
“If we burn it to the ground,I am happy to do that with you.” Best line I ever heard in my life.
What a time to be alive at the same time as you guys, to watch this video while it just was released, I am glad to experience this time in this moment right now
Grabbing my “periods suck, commas rule” shirt out of the closest. 🥳🎉 I’m so excited for y’all’s new step in your friendship and creative new chapter. 🌟
🤧🤧🤧
It’s been 7 years since food battle ended… do we get a decade reunion in 3 years time??? Or will they get right back into the saddle… who knows but I’m excited af
I could cry right now
Your guys' trajectory reminds me of the Jonas Brothers, and seeing how successful and happy they are now, Smosh should be in for a good comeback ❤
So happy to see you guys sit down. I’ve missed this!
Yay Mykie! love her so much!!
Crazy shit! So nice to see Smosh coming full circle. Wishing the best to Anthony and Ian :)
seeing these two back together is the best thing that’s happened in YEARS
WAIT NEW FOOD BATTLE?!?
Such a shame you guys bottled up so much emotions during the later years of SMOSH, but I'm glad you guys were able to go on the journeys you guys needed to in order to become friends again
This is insane. The Pokemon Theme Song video was literally the first video i ever watched on YouTube. I was literally like 6 or 7, and now I'm 25. This is insane.
I'm still in the middle of the video, but I am so incredibly happy seeing you two come back together in whatever way it maybe. I vividly remember that at some point I started losing interest in your main channel's content, but I watched lunchtime and mail time with smosh religiously and enjoyed it so much because it was  just you two being randomnly funny and doing stupid shit together.  So, not to take anything away from your great work, but to me, it was always about you two and your chemistry much more than any crafted content.
why is this so heartwarming? I can't stop tearing up dammit
If we burn it into the ground I'm happy to do that with you is the most sweetest thing Ian could say
There is a god
It would be interesting to have an interview with Rhett and Link to figure out how they managed to stay friends over the years even though Good Mythical Morning grew to quite a big company.
Where did Ian get that tortilla shirt
I really hope you two won’t upload to much on smosh. I just love to see an episode a month.
Congratulations guys!! Let’s see what Smosh does now.
Ian hasnt aged a day since like 2010
wuff 😋
This made me cry a few tears
Oh, there he is!
Anthony where did you get the boots. There nice.
GAS STATION TWEAKERS???
Smosh is back
Oh no, what is the milk fan fic? Is it like hat fic level bad or what? Save me,  I'm curious but I don't want that shit. 😭
All we need is joji on cold ones and it will be all good again  Love smosh and love seeing you guys together again, it's my highschool years all over again
My childhood reuniting during my adulthood, what a fucking miracle 🫶🏽
I'm crying, I love you guys ❤
The Two Amigos
This comment will get lost in the sea, but i grew up watching you guys. I made youtube channels with friends thinking of you guys. Your influence is unimaginable to you. You have beautiful souls and im so grateful for Smosh.
Please do a food battle! Holy shit guys
Rare Millennial W!
Be honest, who else started crying when Anthony started to cry when he was talking about reconnecting to Ian.
wow! witnessing some internet history today.
YOOOOOOOOO
My inner 8 year old is really happy right now, I’m very glad you guys are back to Smosh. ¡Can’t wait to see what is coming!
BoxMan returns music video
We're in the good timeline
The renewal and unlooked for rapprochement is so moving.  Like someone coming back from the dead.  I'm very happy you guys were able to find each other again.  Salute!   xoxo
Invite rhett and link next! Love them for what they did to smosh ❤
my inner child is healing. this was a beautiful video, I cried seeing these two back together again❤ cant wait for new smosh videos
I feel like the title should be... We Spent A Day with Smosh. ❤🥲
This made me tear up
THE MILK FIC😭😭😭😭
Hellyeah man this is a fraction of my childhood right here
It's heartwarming to see them in this episode.
ngl, my favorite smosh show back in the day was "Lunch Time With Smosh" on your second channel,  that shit was comedy gold
I’m 23 years old I’ve been subscribed for many years I cannot explain how much this means for my inner child that you guys are together again
I think all humans have the same sense of toilet humor. We just hide it from our different age groups because its either considered childish as an adult, or only for adults as children... disrespectful to say infront of elders, or irresponsible for elders to say infront of younger people. I still hear and laugh at the same penis jokes I did in 2nd grade and I work a full time job now. Ill probably be a frail old man dying in his bed still giggling at the word "scrotum" or "taint".
I’M SO HAPPY
Wtf Anthony is 35??? He does not look a day older than 25
Good to see Ian Hecocks and Anthony Padildo back together!!
Thank you for keeping SMOSH alive, Ian ❤❤
Imagine if they brought back the OG smpsh games, man I would die, I'm 29 now but smosh is one of the few things im my life that keeps me a child on thebinside.
I wish you luck men, looking forward to the new content
As a newer Smosh fan, hearing the news kinda scared me for the future. But after coming here to watch this video, I have high hopes for whats to come. 🫡
Teenage me is THRIVING
I'd never thought I'd see this happen.
seeing anthony and ian even just interact is giving me a little more faith in humanity
I remember when I was 11 and first found you guys. Seeing how you've both grown makes me excited for the new content that'll be coming up! I can't wait for this new era of Smosh
I think I feel comfy watching smosh again. There was a period in time where idk man, smosh didn’t feel the same and I lost interest. And knowing these two are back at it again feels like a fresh restart to me seeing what’s next
Such a beautiful interview
i dont know about you but the smosh movie was perfect to me
Oh shit
Okay. Now bring back the bowl cut and emo hair. 😂
Bro this is gonna be the best come back of all time. Ian and Anthony where my favorite content creators I remember when I bought the Assasins Creed 3 song on apple music. (was the best song of all time)
If i see a game bang on smosh im gonna shit my pants.
So is Smosh back-back? Some Ian and Anthony sketches soon? ❤❤❤
this feels so nostalgic, i literally grew up watching them
1:11:36 "And if we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do that with you”  I'm not crying, *you’re* crying!
It'd be really dope for you to have the Smosh Games crew next (Joven, Mari, Sohinki, Lasercorn)
Yo, I’m crying so hard, Smosh was and still is such a big part of my life, and also my brother, now that I have grown up and my lil bro is not here anymore, this made me so emotional and existed, I’m gonna hit that join membership button so hard bruh
He did the flip
SOMEONE SEND ME THE MILK FANFIC I MUST READ IT
They are back!! If you don't know who tf Smosh is get off YouTube noobs BTW: we haven't forgot Bout you idiots 😂🎉
Hooray
I can't believe that everyone who guessed they stopped being friends were right the whole time
Omg ! Omg ! Omg! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
God damn what an epic moment in history. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this channel just in time to be a part of this
Are you guys going to try to get Lasercorn, Joven, Mari, and Sohinki back?
OH MY...... Legend reunion
No ******* way😮
This is the therapy session we all needed 6 years ago, and I’m glad all this at the end of the day has helped you reunite and regain your friendship guys
Thank you for the content missed you guys we are all coming back for this one y'all were my tv until the new cast
That whole entire point where Ian was explaining that the team had a rager at defy after knowing that they had just lost their jobs seems so crazy. I just know there was so much rage in all of the cast members and team members that they even pissed on the president's desk(which he deserved) i just cant imagine what that night was like for all of them
Am I dreaming somebody wake me up 😮
This provided so much closure for me as a longtime fan and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for Smosh. I’m so proud of you two ❤
IM COMMANDER SHEPARD AND SMOSH IS MY FAVORITE CHANNEL IS ON YOUTUBE
Just do watever is fun for you❤ glad everything returned to you rightfully!! 😊
This interview came at the right time.
This is pretty nice but hopefully it doesnt mean anthony will stop doing interviews now. Im not very fond of smosh-like channels unfortunately.
Ive been waitong 4 you guys 2 put your differences  ahside i hope you make 1 last smosh video together  just 4 your fans ❤️
W
i still remember the video smosh made announcing that anthony would be leaving the team. crazy to see that im now watching a video about how anthony and ian coming back
You have no idea how happy this makes me feel. Ive been waiting for this moment for a looong time! ❤
Wholesomeness overload
THE MILK FIC REFERENCE oh god NO
I've been here with these guys since the pokemon video --- to see them back together again after all the bullshit makes me so happy. I'm actually crying happy tears while watching this! I love you guys :')
Can't wait for the return of Lunchtime with Smosh.
They should get a deal with Netflix or something to make an MA rated sketch comedy show
I used to ride to school everyday listening to the assassins creed or legend of Zelda rap from the smosh channel. core memories fr.
This was BEAUTIFUL! ✨
Is it just me who thinks Ian sounds kinda like Mr Beast?
Possible epic food battle returning?
How much even was it like $10?
Now we need food battle back
I’m scared to ask but what’s the milk fanfic?
This made me smile so much seeing how happy these two men are. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for them. I grew up watching when I was like 12 now I’m 25. This feels watching two of your old friends getting back together and being so loving and warm to one another.
I'm not crying, you are
i can tell their relationship is still kinda awkward 😢
this kinda felt like earbiscuits by rhett and link
Ok but when’s the next Boxman video
YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!
That feeling of creating the craziest sentimental thing with your best friend and agreeing to run in all down to the ground is the most adrenaline rushing dopamine high ever.  I'm so happy for this! I occasionally just think of firetrucks when my parents walk in while I'm naked.
Hope when smosh starts up again it won't be soooo silly (I have tuned out for a decade) even just a sit down podcast like this from time to time would be great! :)   Hoping this would happen. Didn't think it would :O
and imagine if only they sat one seat farther apart in class… would youtube even still exist?
WAIT DOES THIS MEAN FOOD BATTLE IS BACK?!
I stopped watching Smosh after Anthony left because it didn't feel the same but then I stuck with Anthony this whole time. I even met Smosh back in 2013 and I had sent them Australian snacks so it will be interesting to see what happens next.
I love you guys, you taught me how to be a cop
Thank god for Rhett and Link being there for Smosh when they needed it most...If it wasn't for them, smosh would maybe have stopped and we would never be here in this very moment of existence of Ian and Anthony getting back Smosh! And also massive props for Rhett and Link still getting to be advisors for them. They are the official dads for the people that in a way were the original internet dads....ok bad joke but you get the point lol
when i saw the announcement i was so hoping for this, this is absolutely huge! congrats to anthony and ian 🎉
😱😱
I’m 52 minutes in but are we getting food battle 2023?
Never thought this day would come.
I wish I could like this twice
Next we need "I spent a day with Ian’s mom"
I'm really happy for you guys 🥹
Best car ever is still my fav
"Are those cupholders?!   i'lL bUy iT!😃😃😃"   "dOn'T gOw In tHaT dOwr, ThErE mAwNsTerS!" --- "SHUT UP!!!!"  Good times!
I was like 8 years old starting watching them now am 18 i even learned english from them but still can't write😂
take a shot every time someone says "like"
just read the milk fic
Its crazy to hear and be reminded of every shit show and all wonderful moments that you two created. Thank you for a large part of my childhood!
I missed Smosh so much. even though it wasnt gone, it was never the same with Anthony gone. This now... Its like my childhood returned for an hour <3
No you spent over 15 years with Ian Hecox
I am  happy that you two are friends again! I could tell that the company was draining you guys. I'm having a hard time putting into words  everything I'm feeling because I found Smosh in the "Cat Soup" Era and now I'm 30. Smosh is one of the only channels I have merch from, and I bought it my freshman year of college because my parents couldn't tell me no anymore lol. Ultimately, I'm glad you two are coming back in the healthiest way possible. I'm super excited for Smosh's future and your personal futures now that you guys know how to balance that. ❤❤❤ (One teeeeny request, any teleporting fat guy reference would be amazing, even in a poster, I get the song stuck in my head weekly still lol)
He started tearing up during the around 43 minute mark
More like Ian HUGECOX amirite?!
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do it with you" T0T
😭 i'm so glad for you guys
Even watching this I get chills. I love the new Smosh stuff but I also missed this!
the disbelief i had when i saw this video on my reccomended. oh my god.
Why isn't this trending?
Now all we need is for Jenna marbles to come back
Good on anthony to help a small youtuber in need
i had no idea rhett and link even bought smosh so when i saw the post on mythical this morning i was so confused. but heck, y’all are amazing and i’m so glad you guys are doing this again. congrats!
who tf said i'm crying?! I'm  not  crying!
I used to watch smosh when i was like 2 years old
Almost 20 years? I'm from Perú, living in Perú and I remember those days like it was yesterday. Crystal clear, somany years passed? This is weird.
Seeing these two together again makes me smile
When Ian’s mom came in in the announcement video I actually laughed out loud remembering her in the old skits. So glad you guys are back
I am crying my inner child is happier than ever
this is an episode i didn’t know i needed <3
Keep it real Gs. Love yall, just chill and no pressure
this is definitely the good ending. <3 we love you two
FOOD BATTLE 2023!!!!
This is weirdly feels like a public therapy for you guys, so much personal stuff. I'm glad yall are friends again now ❤
Ik yall wont want to just keep rehashing ideas from the past BUT can we pls see the return of FOOD BATTLE 😭
9:09 Can’t help but think about the story of the Defy CEO pitching a sketch with a talking elephant to Ian
I remember spending my summers binge watching their skits and lunchtime with Smosh as I ate my lunch along with them. This heals my inner child
I've always loved Smosh only because of Boxman, loved that shit.
Have you ever reached out to Makemebad35? I know in the past he wanted to get back into content creation. Would love to see you guys do those random cameos again sometime. Love you guys!
If you love something, let it go, if it comes back to you, it was meant to be. And this, my friends, was meant to be ❤
Excited for the new generation to experience Smosh, excited for those of us who were there for the Smosh of old, excited for this huge opportunity for you both!! I really feel like I have come full circle with you guys from 2010 to now - thank you for sharing your butthole jokes with all of us, love you guys ♡
the second i heard they they said they bought smosh back i looked it up to confirm this found out its true.. im literally crying and this is just amazing news to me
Both are back with Smosh and sole owners again! WOOOO
Unrelated, but Ian doesn’t get enough credit for being FOINE
Can’t wait to see that first Sketch.
Next up, Jake and Amir buy Jake and Amir
I enjoyed smosh the movie but I’m a fucking smosh lover
I never thought I'd live to see the day actually happen. I'm dreaming, but this isn't a dream. I'm more than excited to see this happen!
it’s insane how i’m watching these two in my 20’s, having grown up in my elementary to middle school days. i remember the movie coming out, and looking back it’s really a defining moment in youtube history. a youtube channel, two teens just having fun, made a movie together. it showed everyone that youtube was more than a video streaming site, but rather an entire career path that takes normal people and turns them into A list celebrities. you two, jacksepticeye, markiplier, even Logan Paul and so many more started in their bedroom and turned into house hold names around the globe. you walked, so that so many others could run. truly incredible what you’ve done and what you’ve continued to do.
“i still had my childhood friend” IM FUCKING BAWLING MY EYES OUT, i love anthony, i love them both sm and hope the best for this new journey.
this is healing a huge part of my inner child ❤
What I’m getting from this episode is they don’t give a shit what their requests or recommendations are and just have a guest on just because they have news. Same with talk shows. Not that it’s a bad thing. It just shows they don’t care or read our comments.
I just want to say I did like that smosh movie when I was smaller
Also bring back Mari....
It makes me so happy to see you talk about stuff together, and I hope this new chapter will be a healthier and happier one.  So excited!!
i didn't watch the video.i just wanna say yall made my childhood so funny
Please bring back the shut up intro
This is so wild. Also bring back the lunch videos. I used to watch you guys eat lunch in the car all the time and it was the best lol
I think they did the right thing by "breaking up", im happy it happened and im sad to see if go, but smosh has played its part and it's not what it used to be. Im happy they're still friends though 😁
Sup nick
LETS GOOOO
yuppp
Honestly, hearing about this whole story made me think about myself. I find myself relating to Anthony about his past perciptation of friendships and in this moment I'm still learning and dealing with it. So hearing about this makes me feel heard and makes me moviated to be better. This episode was insightful. Thank you.
Ian dressed like a miami drug dealer in 1980
"If we burn it to the ground, I am happy to that with you"   Tears. Just tears
With modern day youtube being very heavily saturated with sponsorships and ad reads, it does seem pretty difficult to incorporate them into skits or short form content.  Many YouTubers have been using merch instead to make up well over 80% of their income to great success. I hope the crowd funding strategy works well for Smosh, many people have tried to emulate Smosh but you guys will always be the front runners and always set the standard
My questions about the Smosh magazine have been answered. I can sleep now.
You and Ian reuniting and doing Smosh again is the best thing to happen in 2023. I am so  happy for you both, you have no idea how much your content means to me. Love you guys, been subscribed since 2005
this means that.... FOOD BATTLE RETURNS!?
Can't wait to see the energy between Shayne, Anthony and Ian. They all have a sense of humor I can see mesh well incredibly.
The ultimate interview. Bring the milk, boyz!
hype
Dude, everyone knows what smosh is otherwise they wouldn't even know you exist.
so when is the next food battle?
This is kinda crazy and...wow! Run out of words for this one 🙂
Can’t stop smiling rn man
1:11:30 jeez… hadn’t felt emotional at all during any of the videos released today and at all during this video. But when Ian said this my eyes FILLED with tears. What a f*cking line dude, that’s probably the coolest thing I’ve ever head Ian say in a video
That you for this, SMOSH was life for my best friends and I. Just recently reconnected with my childhood best friend. Y’all could have easily had this discussion privately so I appreciate and thank you for doing this. I’m so excited for the future, even more excited to watch your videos with my best friend again, 15 years later.
Ian gives off the vibes of a guy that donates like $5k a month to St Jude's under a pseudonym and never tells anyone because "Idk just a thing I did whatever"
They finally got it back
FINALLY. The two YouTube kings are together again!
I wonder the story behind Anthony's tattoos.
I'm so happy about all this, my older brother and I grew up watching Smosh and we were so close with our bond regarding the OG Smosh content, He's now an accountant and moving away for work and has distanced himself from family. I should reach out to him and share the news. Thank you Ian & Anthony. This is a new era and I'm excited to see what happens next! ❤
Food Battle 2023
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you." 🥲
It’s not much bought I hope it multiplies for smosh!!!💕
The biggest smile have right now. I love these two so much they made childhood better for  memories.
This is so absolutely exciting
sounds like all conversations between coworkers under poor working conditions
Oh yeah
Watching this legit made me cry I am so happy for you guys like SOOO happy.
Next episode should be. I spent a day with old Smosh fans
Damn, this is big!
Here's hoping they continue the Pokemon series lol
akhsks i was a far off witness to old smosh so i did not know you guys had a milk fic too. there’s an infamous p!atd fic that is also called the milk fic…
Did anyone had tears of joy or even like waiting for this moment since the day Anthony left smosh six years ago?
My family is together again 💜✨😭
I didn't start watching Smosh videos until about 2012. Late to the party, but man, did those ridiculous and out there videos of their's help me really pull through some of my darkest times. But I fell off watching them because of mental health related issues and did not look them up for a really long time, and when I did I found that the Smosh Bros were no longer together, that hit me in the feels. YouTube after that wasn't were I came to find funny anymore. Today my news feed announced they were back together, and I'm super-stoked for these two to be back together creatively. The world needs Smosh
This is amazing, you guys are part of my childhood, one of the first ever people that i watched on youtube
-0:05
WHAT THE F-
SMOSH NEEDS IAN AND ANTHONY
im actually so happy omg
So food battle?
God this is so surreal
Smosh is the blink-182 of YouTube iykyk
They like milk confirmed 😂
Finally. Nature is healing. 😭❤
I think I speak for millions when I say congratulations and honestly can't wait
holay molay
bro that shit made me cry
You guys made my childhood! I never thought Id ever see you guys  together back again but it warms my heart like you have no idea. I wish you guys the best of luck for your new projects! ♥
WE NEED LUNCHTIME WITH SMOSH ONE DAY
I remember watching mail time with smosh when i was in middle school, taco bell became my favorite restaurant. I am 23 now, tomorrow is my day off. im smoking a joint and having a beer since I got the house to myself and watching this. making me tear up. some things stay the same
Return of the kings
I had the biggest grin watching this, my childhood feels like it’s healing lol
They're so in love rn it's killing me. (If you can't tell this is a joke and you watch these two, get help😅)
Soo can we get A comeback to Mailtime with Smosh..? 👀
Give me a moment to bawl my eyes out brb
Biggest W in 2023
what would you do if when you ok so he said yes would go?
0mg ... I was half way through when I noticed that this thing is more than an hour long, Anyways Anthony needs to do Rhett and Link next.
2 bros, talking about their feelings , 5 ft apart cuz they’re not gayyy 🙂
if they bring back lunchtime with smosh i’ll lose it
I'm not the only one who anticipates an episode of Anthony takes Ian clothes shopping lol. Being a stipulation of the reunion since Ian still wears the same clothes he had in high school and SWAG bags lol
why does Ian have a good arch?
I'm so happy right now!
Damn I'm genuinely excited
padilla gotta be on Cold Ones now
i am so happy you guys have reconnected and are great friends again <3
Don't forget to bring back Patrick for El Smosh, the Spanish version of smosh
Link: "We'll figure out the business side of it. But that's not the most important thing. How can we make this happen?"   Rhett and Link are truly the internet's dads.
i would like to think that Rhett and Link were just keeping smosh for you guys, so glad to see you back together, and with those hugs you need to revisit the guys' guide to hugging guys
Worth watching the whole thing.." let´s burn it to the ground.. but together" almost cried ❤😭
you guys are finally back!! :')
Pinch me, it must be 2006 again
Hopefully we get more cannon pen1s! 🤣🤣
Where were you when SMOSH came back i was out house eating dorito when phone ring "SMOSH is liv" "Yes"
So happy for you two! Excited to see what content you make in the future!
Freakin' Iconic. I miss the Smosh episode of Ian finding the Genie-Bong on an abandoned Island and wishing for that Flippin' Flamingo.
I’m so happy for you two
THIS MAKES ME SO FUCKIN HAPPY AND NOSTALGIC!! 😮‍💨 I’m hype, y’all can still do your own things of course but please don’t get discouraged to think you can play a part together with the smosh. Cause y’all both individually are great creatives but together have a special place in alot of people’s hearts 🙏🏼💙
What are you we going to do about Shayne and the others of the main Smosh channel if it dedicated to the duo. I feel like Shayne and the crew that was brought in are foundational to the new smosh.
Ian HE-COCKS lmao..glad these two are back, even if they cant bring back the old things im looking forward to whats to come :DDD at least food battle..good shit
A walk down memory lane... soo fucking happy for you both. You've both come so far, and now to come back together... crazy. So excited for everyone involved💙💙💙😢
anthony has the power of listening and nodding!!!!
i hate to be that guy but jesus ian comes off as such an asshole in this interview.
the terraria music at 1:08:00 went so hard
I never thought I would see the day. This is seriously amazing. I'm so happy for you guys!!
T-T the boys are back
All the feels ❤
Feels we went on a whole journey😅. Glad you guys back together on the grind. Felt this was very much needed like all of YouTube believes this
I BUSTED OUT CRYING THIS CANT BE REAL THIS IS LITERALLY INSANE 😭💕
A day? That's kinda small
The OGs of Smosh in one video together this is the collab I was waiting for
OMFG
So is this the real hour long smosh special after all these years?😂
i had forgotten about the milk fanfic omfgggg
This feels like therapy ❤
Its like reliving the late 2000s-early 2010s again.  My nostalgia is through the roof.
Times have been tough for me and my family the past couple years, multiple deaths in the family one of which being less than 2 weeks ago, financial issues, and just general tension between loved ones, seeing this truly brought me joy in a time where I thought happiness was just a distant memory...  I can't stop crying, seeing you two together again just gives me hope that things won't be bad forever.   Congratulations on owning Smosh again, I honestly never thought this day would come, I'm so glad that you're both happy again and thank you for beinging a light in the darkness for me and I'm sure many others as well!
im not crying. you are.
I’m 30 now and thanks to those guys I learned English ! Thank you for everything! And for this amazing comeback ! A huge fan from Mexico ! And yes Padilla still Mexican 😂😂
They look like a gay couple
hell yea
I wish we could see the Smosh cast react to finding out Anthony came back
This truly makes me heart happy in the purest way
this is honestly crazy. I'm so excited to see what's coming for the OG smosh. We all miss you two <3
In the same week Damien points out the sketch channel not doing sketches
It's been a joy to watch you guys grow. Welcome back as a duo!!!!
Wow, this was beautiful. It's so wholesome to see you both together. Your friendship is so important. May you keep on persevering together. This does bring a smile to my face
If y'all blow up, I want you two and PewDiePie to go back to that driveway so he can hand y'all back that trophy
"My bff theres nothing left but memories and sadness."
Congratulations so happy for you guys!!!! 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
I guess this is what it feels like to watch your parents doing an hour long marriage counseling session😭
Why am I crying? I missed these two
I hope they end up saving that script that they made together before buying Smosh back. Hopefully, they make that sketch when they’re ready, if at all, because that’s an important stepping stone for not just Smosh, but for them both
this feels less like an interview n more like a conversation .. i love y'all sm
I never comment but this news presented this way is everything and made my heart smile! I've been watching since early smosh because my son's showed videos (some inappropriate but funny) so I've watched ur evolutions and it's awesome to see this, congratulations! ❤
Anthony and Ian are youtube grandfathers
My preteen self, teenage self, and current self is so happy. I feel like peace has been achieved.
I’m in love
Finally, Ian is getting therapy.  His therapists look like Anthony, though..😮
smosh the movie is still one of the funniest movies in my eyes
I'll be 21 years old this year which means I've been watching you guys both together and independently for more than half my life. It was so nice watching this conversation and I'm so excited for this new beginning. It'll be awesome.
It’s so awesome seeing these two back together again. It’s making me think back to the good ol Smosh days 😊
this is so insane. my childhood😭
Brandon Rogers needs to be a guest in a sketch. :D
you know what has to happen now, anthony has to bring back the emo haircut and ian has to bring back the bowl cut
I understand the need to keep things fresh and avoiding this project from becoming a nostalgia trip.  However I demand to see Ian with a pink frosted sprinkle doughnut or I will riot.
I am beyond excited!!! I have no words!! :D
idk why I feel like even with them being back the new smosh videos that will be created in the old style still wont surpass the old somsh
Very interesting story guys!  Learning Smosh history in depth, and how it affected your relationship with each other was more fascinating than I initially expected.  (I watched Smosh episodes for like at least a year or 2. I loved your comedy. Also yes i was even younger at the time.) I lost interest soon after Anthony left Smosh. I think i even felt bummed out about it for some time.
I think this is about to be a renaissance. Just like when Pewds finally reached Japan, I think this moment marks a huge change
26:55 who's phone was ringing? lol
I thought that "Smosh the Movie" was amazing and hilarious😂
Anthony got too hot for Smosh
speaking of blue waffle, I think you're a mail Vlogs told me not to Google it, but I did anyways... so thanks for that. I was like 12 I did not need to see that. 😅
Forget No Way Home, ian and anthony is the reunion we needed!!!!
A day??? Just a day hahaha
Finally, the "Wheres Anthony" joke is officially dead!
The universe has hope once again
Bros went: *"ROUND 2, FIGHT"*
yooo y'all went to the hs thass by my jawn ! i'm from north highlands but not since i was like 15 lmaoo
I’m very keen to see this but I do hope we continue to see the cast we’ve been seeing over the years in Anthony’s absence
So many emotions while watching this, so many things I wanna say, but for now I'll just say: I LOVE YOU GUYS!!! I'm so happy with the news and I'm so ready to watch Smosh's new videos!! <3  Thank you so much for being exactly the way you are. :) I'm proud of both of you! Also, big thanks to Rhett and Link for everything!!   Brazilian Smosher here sending love <3
It’s such a surreal feeling reconnecting with your inner child that binged their videos and to see just how much each of them have grown. We’ve all also changed so much but are still fans deep down of the magic these two created.
FINALLY LUNCH TIME WITH SMOSH AGAINNNN
FINALLY!!
A dad (ian) and his goth son (anthony)
So are we going to get the “shut up” entry of every video again?
I wish we could the the casts reaction to hearing that they bought Smosh
A part of my childhood has now been restored im so excited for this cant wait to see what you guys got in store ita even got me motivated to keep pressing forward
Props to Ian for keeping Smosh alive and not quitting
NO FUCK OFF I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE MILK FIC WHY DID YOU REMIND ME
“I’m from 2013, how is Smosh???” “It’s better, they are together…”
Seeing this video made me reach out to people i haven’t talked to in years. This video also made me realize how old i am. Me and the smosh channel are the same age and it is crazy i grew up with these too. That is crazy.
Oh yeah SMOSH REUNION DADDY!!!!!
I feel like I went to therapy after watching this. Glad for everyone in SMOSH! Cheers!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!
As the kid that ran his bike into the wall in front of you at Schweitzer to get your attention back in like, 2012 or something like that, I'm really happy to see this. "Have a Smoshtastic day" boys :)
Plz food battle thou bring it back
You can see with these two that they've grown far apart from the two teens making videos in their house. It's wild to imagine this collab happening in this specific point of their lives
Smosh will fail for sure
I wish they announced this on April 1st
i love this.
I never thought I’d see this day. So, SO fricking happy right now.
Did I just get sent back to the summer before freshman year?
this feels so weird theyre so formal with eachother
wish the best for y’all bros. glad you guys are beginning to be friends again
Are you guys going to still do food battle
YESSSS YESSSS YYYYESSS, YEAHHH YEAHHH!!!! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE!!!!!
millennial ass video
its impressive how you were able to make an identity that was not related to smosh
Ian : How many did you see?  Anthony : Fourteen million, six hundred and five.   Ian : How many did we win?  Anthony: One.
We love therapy and being able to express our feelings 👏🥹 i have such fond memories of early smosh when it was clear how much more genuine it was. I’m glad you two felt able to reconnect and rekindle a friendship, regardless of smosh/ business. Also all hail rhett and link
I haven’t cried this hard since Avengers: Endgame 😭😭😭
yknow as far as making a legacy for yourselves i feel like smosh as it is now or atleast as i remember it, is a pretty great legacy that atleast i personally would be proud to have left behind
I don't think this is good for Anthony, he has grown so much as an individual an keeps trying to make this work as a friendship and Ian keeps talking like it's purely a business opportunity and closed as a brick, not recognizing any of his own faults. Maybe in a couple of years when he gets more therapy in, but not for now
Now I need "I spent a day with Ian's mom"
Im so happy holy shit
Almost as good of a collab as Leonardo Rafael Donatello and Michelangelo
“if we burn it to the ground, im happy to do that with you” made me SOB
Woooooo🎉
Smosh did so much for youtube and honestly the internet in general. They are true pioneers of our time, and it's really heartbreaking to see what they went through as friends, business partners and creators. It makes you second guess if fame is even worth it at all. Happy to see that the ones that paved the way are still walking down the road.
I hope so much the intro has the "shut up!" still.
pink frosted sprinkled donut
I would love you to connect with Steve-o
watching them together again after so many years feels like a weird form of closure and a cosmic rebirth
Bring back the reading fanfic videos! :D
The collab everyone was hoping for but not really expecting it to happen right now
I would have never thought that this day would ever come. But here we are. I am so glad that you and Ian were able to reconnect as friends again. Looking forward to the future sketches yall will make! OLD SMOSH IS BACK BABBBBYY
The world is healing ❤
I did not see this coming and I had a huge grin on my face the entire video. Been an original fan and can't wait to see this new era! Hope to see you guys make shit together again until you don't want to anymore :3
I will always love old smosh me and brother will love you both for eternity
I cant believe as a new to smosh and just heard anyhony leaving. Yesterday, i saw a month old clips of "wheres Anthony jokes" and reading a comment of  "i spend a day with smosh. The algorithm bruh
!!!!!!!!!! YAY
Finally
32:31 Aww maan, I could feel the “Best-Friend-Forever” high five there :’)
omg it finally happened
I miss ya matt
I only very recently found out that Anthony had a solo channel that he regularly uploaded on. I love how this reintegration was started! Announcement in the morning, tntl in the afternoon, and then a breakdown of how this happened and what this means moving forward to close out the day. Excited for what's to come! It's giving "We're getting the band back together!"
Cup holders?! I’LL TAKE IT!
Man spider is still one of the best sketches ever if that makes either of you feel better
I am glad they bought Smosh back. As soon as Anthony left I stop watching Smosh. I cannot wait to see what they create for the main channel. It seems that I got a part of my life back and I cried a lot during this interview. I am a 33 years old guy.
this is gotta be top 5 best youtube momments cause goddamn its been too long
I feel is bad we cannot leave a  "love/heart" reaction in YouTube videos because this video totally deserves it
Liek if you cri everytiem! But for real, i cried so many time, the last 24 hours was very hard personal, but seeing two friends reconnect and heal was good medicine. Congratulations Ian and Anthony, i can't wait to see what Smosh as in-store.
The timeline is healing
this is litteraly the only time I've ever heard of a corporate buyout of an independent company having a happy ending, it's wonderful to see
Really love the vibes of reflection, appreciation and acceptance from both of you. I can’t imagine how you two must have been shaped being young adults on the internet, being bombarded with popularity in an unknown territory, and having friendship and business rely on each other like a seesaw of pain and fear.  Loved the video and so excited for this new chapter!
The classic Smosh sketches that these two made back when I was in middle school and up through high school, are such a big part of my life and it makes me happy beyond belief that they’re back together again. Makes my heart beyond happy that you guys were able to open up on all of this. Made me emotional to know the friendship is still there 🥹
Oh yay!!! I hope this is so good for them. It’s nice to see them on their journey together
Legit teared up when anthony did, its so heart warming to hear my favorite childhood channel stars were able to find each other again
This is literally so touching the idea that you can just be friends with someone for so long makes me so emotional
Rhett and Link just confirmed they are the internet Dads
Go ahead and give me this channel so work on smosh
Wait what? no way!
You have no idea how happy this makes me, not only that you two will be creating together again but that the two of you found one another as friends after all the corporate bullshit drove you apart.  I literally have goosebumps watching this, and on the verge of tears. With all the horrible things happening on the internet daily this should be celebrated
:)
YouTube’s renaissance is starting now
i missed you guys :(
I’m excited for another Pokémon song
Food Wars 2023?????????
FRIENDSHIP NEVER DIES!!!
real life mordecai and rigby
I really feel like Patrick needs to do a brief cameo at some point. I am so fucking happy to see you both together and even more to support you. What a day
AWWWWWWWWWWW MYKIEEEEEEEEE
As someone who has also gone through years long separation/not talking with my best friend. There is truly something special about a reconnection. His wife and my husband both say we are much happier and healthier when we are talking. Best friends are a kind of soulmate.
Finally!
my jaw literally dropped when i saw the news like … i started watching smosh when i was about 8 years old , and now i’m in my 20s and knowing classic smosh is back is healing my inner child like you wouldn’t believe
IM JUST SPEECHLESS. My soul has healed watching this all unfold
I live in the best TimeLine ;-;
Everyone’s childhood long lost is found once again, let’s keep it that way
Bring back mail time with smosh lmao
I HAD FORGOTTEN THE MILK FANFIC
I really appreciate the honesty from both of you
My inner child rn is so happy 😂😂😂😂
Oh hell ya old smosh gang is back!!yes!!!!
YES YES YES YES YES
the ian persona and the ian as a person is so wildly different. he feels more apathetic.
They speak so similarly it's insane
Yesterday was such a roller-coaster 😂
The one old series they should continue though is food battle
The perfect timeline…
can we also talk about how HANDSOME YOU BOTH ARE????
Such well spoken individuals
Bro y’all where my whole childhood I loved y’all’s videos so much. I remember going on YouTube to see if y’all posted anything. My favorite was y’all’s video game songs and the food fight. I am so glad y’all got the channel back so happy for yall.
no way
Amazing stuff guys!!
My dad's are back together 🤠
Yes let's go kings
Both of you were a big part of my childhood and I'm pretty sure most of us does too so from the bottom of my heart I wanna say thank you, to both of you for making our childhood a firetrucking awesome and thuper ♥️♥️♥️
So much of this interview is representative of a lot of peoples friendships, but mainly for me it represents the friendship of me and my childhood best friend. When he moved away when we were 15 years old, the friendship suffered at first, and it took a while to work out what the friendship was. Years later in 2018 we went to New Zealand together, and that was our litmus test to see if there was still a solid friendship there, or whether everything was based on nostalgia and our friendship was best in the past.  I'm flying up to stay with him next week. I am proof that Ian and Anthony are going to make this work, and we are going to have some incredible content come our way made by some fantastic friends.
I had to tell my friends about the news the instant it dropped. The classic Smosh videos are literally our childhoods/teen years. I remember the days we'd get together to watch the new videos every Friday
im so proud u guys talked and worked things out u both have really grown so much cant wait to see you and Ian doing old school style smosh
It’s so Amazing and kinda surreal to see these two together again. Lol Love you both so much! Long live the OG Smosh Team! <3
51:42 lol that laugh , you know is real
This is just plain awesome.
I feel like a kid again, this is unreal.
man i love you guys
“Know what? Only that the long night is over. The crown of Smosh is tarnished, but that will fade in time. The decreased quality of videos, a fever dream; the separation between Anthony and Ian, a horrible nightmare; and like everything else that's happened such things will only be dimly remembered upon waking to their normal lives. In the end, all sins are forgiven. Even yours.”
Dont know what smosh
I almost cried every 10 minutes!! Bruh a fam since the Pokemon vids 🔥 CANT WAIT. IAN ROAST ME
Remember the smosh movie it was amazing  I want a another one 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I remember my friend showing me Frankie Rogers is James Bond back in the day and I got hooked to Smosh. I think in many ways, Smosh shaped our senses of humor and our childhoods. We often quoted videos, sang the Boxman song, and even made our own videos.
can we get a good old new version of the "SHUT UP!" Intro from now on?
Man I’m so excited to see this new era! I miss seeing you guys do stuff together.
I am so happy the og Smosh is back! It feels so surreal ❤!
So happy. So excited. Thank you, I love you guys <3 4ever
LEGENDARY! 🔥🔥🔥
This is so awesome seeing the two of you reunited. I can’t wait to see what the future holds.
Im getting so emotional. I've watched you guys since the start. I stopped watching for a while but was reintroduced a few years back and now. OG SMOSH IS BACK. F*ckyeah, best day ever.
I think about cat soup every day. That's an impact. And probably trauma.
This is truly what needed to happen I can't wait to see what they do together as owners of Smosh. This Collab was great. I will genuinely try to support Smosh when I get enough money to do so.
yessss finally
My Favourite era from You Guys was when u would take your car and drive places to try something new that was fun. Sometimes I’m eating and a ‘first bite’ comes out of my mouth 🤣
Im so fucking excited rn
Just when I finally was accepting old smosh is dead, u two showed up to prove me wrong... thank u
food battle 2023?
this is one of the few times, you hear ian sound smart, and I love it so much
Smosh hiring?
Never noticed it before but Ian's personality changes when he's around Anthony compared to others.  Like its subtle but I notice that he seems more relaxed around him.
glad daily vlogs are coming back!
WAIT THEY OWN SMOSH AGAIN? TIME TO RESUBSCRIBE
"And if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you" MY FEELINGS
Catch me trying not to cry, while also looking through the comments to see if anyone knows who pissed on the Defy president's desk👀
this is the best day of my life. al you have to do now is bring back the bowlcut and emo hair. food battle 2023 is about to be epic.
there’s a lot in this video that’s pretty heavy but “if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you” genuinely made me tear up
FUCK YEAH
Smosh has been around almost as long as I've been alive. I found Smosh through the 'I broke my foot' and fell in love with the comedy of it at like 6 years old. Definitely shouldn't have, but I did. I think I still have one recording on my phone of me laughing my ass off trying to get some Autocorrect thing from a video because it made me laugh so hard. I missed the comedy, and now that I'm old enough to fully understand the dirty jokes and the other absurd humor, I truly can't wait to see what you guys have to show. This means so much to me, and I'm glad I finally got to hear more from Ian's side of the story.
ah man the blissful days of my childhood watching the molester moon video not knowing what it meant on my ipod good times ❤
Ian Hancock
This
AYO
1:01:04 Ian got me tearing up cause it’s the truth
42:38 I’m crying 😭
We desperately need Food Battle 2023 Please I beg you
thank you both so much for your vulnerability and candid conversation this many years later. it is such a testament to your connection…that even in your separate growth, you can come back together stronger, alongside that initial foundation you built so long ago. regardless of what you both decide to create, i am elated that you both have that ownership back. what an amazing video this was to see, as a fan. i’m just so excited for you both ♥️
Legends !!
To think that Smosh is back together... This truly means a lot, and I know not just to me who feels really attached to that channel because of how much I watched you guys as a kid (including all the other channels), but to everyone else that also felt a part of that huge thing you guys created. This is just really awesome to see
rip our “where’s Anthony” jokes, but this is such an awesome thing to see and really feels cool to see as a fan!! wishing y’all both success!!
the chemistry that both of them have is incredible, they should work together sometime
The time has finally come
No way it's back
Cant believe they destroyed the link and assassin's Creed costumes 🤢🤮
I’m so flippin happy for you guys! Sometimes things happen so that other things can happen. And this is one of those things.  Best wishes to you all. Looking forward to the new future of SMOSH!!
Hats off to the video pump out after the announcement y’all came prepared to capitalize on the timing good shit
BOX MAN JUST GOT A GIRLFRIEND
It's been 6 long years. This whole news related to smosh enlightened my entire day today.
iremember watching smosh when youtube was even born .... good times
:)
The legendary duo is back!
Now all the people who have been crying about how much they miss the old Smosh can SHUT UP!
🎊
Man, Im so happy for you both! Hope this grows into something even bigger!
Still to this day I talk about the good ol Smosh videos with friends and we have a bunch of laughs remembering the stupid funny stuff you guys did. I'm so glad there is hope again for Smosh
I've been a Smosh fan my whole life and seeing the journey of these two is so incredible.
This makes me so happy. And I wasn't even sad. Thank you both for everything. Now twerk, but at the same time.
Man watching Ian and Anthony speak is just nice to see again especially there is no parent company holding Smosh back now. We can finally see and hear the humor of Original no corporate jokes that ate genuine again.
Broooo I remember their pokemon in real life videos! I watched them in like 2010 or something
“Even if it doesn’t do well, I know that this is the right thing, and if we burn it to the ground, I’m happy to do that with you.” Ian Hecox, I kept it together this whole video until this! Ian and and Anthony are truly platonic soulmates. I’m so happy they found each other again. That time apart was crucial.
My 2023 bingo card looking real weird rn
Not me crying about the support from Rhett and Link.
Ian brings out Anthony's giggly almost purring laugh that seems so rare so hear, but I heard it like three times in this video. I'm so excited to see all of the ideas and creative content you have in store for us!
This is the way.
I really did like the smosh movie
food battle finally has a platform to return to
I love you guys
As someone who used to watch ALL the Food Battles and old smosh content this is like a dream come true right here. Never did I think we’d get them back together again🥲
Ian is such a girlboss! He kept Smosh alive after Anthony left, when defy flopped and when covid happened! Very excited for this era 🎉
This is like the best state that Smosh could possibly be in: - Ian and Anthony are the core of the main Smosh channel again - The rest of the crew and videos are still there in the Smosh Pit and Games channels (current Smosh fans are there for the crew and the main Smosh channel kinda became the weakest link in the smosh familty) - Anthony can still make the I spent a day series
Ily
Dudes, have seen yall since the beginning years, what a crazy time to comeback to see such news.  So proud at just how much you two have grown, to regained yourselves and foundations only to comeback twice as strong with years of experience under yall's belt. Just hearing that yall finally got to rekindle the friendship that started it all is incredible. Had some doubts but in the end, I'm relieved to see the touch hasn't been extinguished. Honestly can't wait to see what's in store in the future with happy creative hearts.  Here's to burning it to the ground. (and omg, why the milk! I had spent over a decade to forget that memory XD lol jk, love you guys. )
I remember asking for an apple gift card (mind you j didn't own apple products so everyone was confused) and used that to buy myself the smosh movie for my 15th birthday as it came out the day before my birthday then had my friends who were smosh fans over for a sleepover and we watched the movie together. I think smosh was my second ever YouTube channel that I'd subscribed to at 10 (the first was Shane Dawson which obviously didn't age well lmao) so following you guys through this whole journey for 13 years and seeing you come back together has honestly made my year. Thank you for shaping my childhood guys ❤️
The wholesome content I needed in my day 🥲
1:11:07 I almost cried, that was so wholesome 😭❤️. My inner child is so happy this is happening rn, love you both so much, I literally grew up watching Smosh and I'm so happy that you guys connected again. So exited for whats to come <3
As a long time viewer, I am so happy to see you both back making content together! I can’t wait to watch both your current content here and your new content back at smosh!
Such a healthy in-depth conversation with so many broad points!! The growth!! I love it!!!
All I wanna know is when is Food Battle 2023 coming
Smosh occupies a really special place in a lot of our hearts. I used be around 12-14 and now I am about to be 24. It broke my heart to see what I perceived to be a special friendship be gone forever since you both didn't do any or much content once it ended. Then your journeys apart also grew so differently. New Smosh has some really cool talent like shayne courtney noah and all the rest. While Anthony seemed to grow and showcase more maturity talking to so many different people and bringing their stories to us. In the end, I love this triumphant return and appreciate the general positivity of regaining friendship once again. I hope Smosh does well and you both are happy.
I still miss Ryan Todd 😢
Hell yeah, congratulations to you guys! I loved old Smosh & watched every video, sometimes over & over. I really tried to support Smosh after Anthony left, but after a while I just couldn't. I wouldn't click on them. They just weren't funny anymore. I'm so excited you're back together & I am looking forward to the new old Smosh! Yay!!!! Love you guys ❤️‍🔥
I couldn’t help but just smile the whole video
YouTube is healing!!!
common smosh W
I’m so happy for you guys
I used to watch Smosh many years ago, but felt the evolution of my sense of humour of yours drifted apart, so I eventually stopped watching. It was nice to hear Ian talking seriously about his experience of producing for Smosh.
i found Smosh since 2014, when Anthony and Ian separated..my heart breaks into half..but when i saw this video, i knew that they would return the OG Smosh
Omg legend
Smosh means a lot to my own personal growth and this was an emotional ride for me, I’m so happy to see this from you two.
Food battle is coming back.
i get the sense that Anthony kinda selfishly abandoned ship and left Ian at the helm, and Ian is still probably mad about about that
Some may say it was a cannon event
Anthony dropping two banger episodes with two awesome people. Vsauce and Ian bringing me back to your channel.
Everyone's comments on on Smosh over the years asking "Where's Anthony " and saying "I miss the old Smosh " finally paid off 😂
Now bring back FOOD BATTLES!!
Being a og fan of smosh, somehow this interview is fricking hitting me emotionally and actually making me tear up with joy. Being depressed with life,  this is making me genuinely happy for some reason. Can't wait for you guys!!
As soon as I saw this I immediately stopped what I was doing to watch it
Good old times
it's crazy how such "small" acts of kindness can go so far without you knowing remembering that is what keeps me able to give strangers random compliments/perform random kind acts even when im feeling shy
and then said company whent to crap
"I mean it, let's burn this to the ground."  "Let's do this".  Perfect final moment. Almost movie-like. Good luck to you both, may the algorithm forever be in your favor
Please bring back meal time with smosh
Is this channel gonna be absorb by smosh?
So y’all just gonna announce the purchase and then fire out ALL the content at once 🤯
This is such a fever dream to my 12 year old self.
Pog
I truly and sincerely hope the first video they make on smosh, togethera again, is either a lip sync or food battle 2023
The world is healing! OG Smosh is back!!!!
I really want to see the old Smosh Games crew come back.
literally i am not seriously speculating another relationship after the shit dan and phil went through but jesus f christ ian is not helping their case like how do you know so much of the plot from their fics??? my guy lmfao????
Shut up! (and take my money)
What took you so long 😢
I grew up Loving “Shut up, Cartoons”.
It's so nice seeing these two interacting with each other again.
It was really nice to hear this story. I feel really good about where this is going.
43:30 Anthony realizes why actors have different names when they are performing so you don't collapse on the inside.
LETS GOOOO
What about Smosh games?
Feels odd to see you both as accomplished adults.
Of all the music in existence, I would never have guessed that Ian and Anthony are Refused fans
MORE FOOD BATTLE.....???????????
Get Gabriel iglesias on this
I didn’t know how much I needed to see Anthony and Ian hug 😢
This interview was the Smosh movie we all wanted
Finally the professy foretold of this event for years
Hellllll yessssss!!!!
everything is healing
SMOSH THE MOVIE was amazing 🤣🤣🤣 I LOVED it as a kid
WHATTTTTTTTTT THIS IS WONDERFUL
I better see Food Battle
The Milk fanfic is already fodder for Smosh Pit Theater.
LOL The ending kills me because I have this image in my head now of a LOT of you guys going....Milk..fanfic?....*google search becomes VERY VERY busy* lol
so who's the hot one now
Milk??
I cannot explain the feeling in my chest hearing those first few seconds, it’s like a shattered piece of childhood has reformed 😭
stfu i’m so hyped for this i’ve been with you guys since the beginning
What were the factors that helped them say "yes" to doing this than 3 years ago? Youtube memberships?
Smosh is back.
Hey in Brazil there is a sketch channel that has 17,7 M subscribers, the views on their channel often is around 800 k per video and it has been 10 years that they have been in YouTube, it is called "Porta dos Fundos".
Wow. I've been following Smosh since the beginning and I'm one of the weirdos out there who is old enough to be their dad.   I'm not sure what that says about me, but I liked watching lowbrow humor.  But what it really was for me was watching friends make each other laugh.  It's why I still liked Smosh even after Anthony left.  It was something the new cast still manage to do.  I'm really happy people have healed and moved on and have come together again. And as an old (literally) Smosh fan I'm not expecting nostalgia.  I'm just excited to see what new shenanigans will arise.
year 7 of waiting for food battle 2017
REUNION  :D
Hope you two are happy, you made a grown man cry....
o m g
its clear that their dynamic has changed, but for a long time the dynamic they had was made specifically for the camera. being able to see something raw with so many feelings; a kind of truth to the friendship they have now is thrilling and wonderful. i was heartbroken when Anotony left and when the charm and the magic of it all sort of fell apart. but now the little kid in me has been healed and i couldnt be more excited for the "brand new" era of Smosh.
33:33 ITS A CANNON EVENT BROO
Ghad dangg finally
Foodbattle 2023 when
Commenting for the algorithm
Honestly tearing up. I love this so much.
this was 100% therapeutic for the both of them. I can literally cry seeing them two back together ugh my childhood
this video made me jealous I dont have a friendship like they do mostly becuase of me tbf but damn
Hope we'll also see lunchtime with Smosh every once in a while
Time to ian to be dumb again..in smosh...
I’m now 21, but growing up in rural Australia, my entertainment in the 2010’s was watching Smosh, Pewdiepie, Jacksepticeye, Markiplier etc. School and work life disabled me from keeping up with these YouTubers. Eventually, I found these channels again. I never thought of the “OG Smosh” as “The hot guy” and “The funny guy”. I always enjoyed the sketches and was inspired by the creativity. I am now a performer, and I wouldn’t have been able to do it without the experience of growing up watching smosh. I’m really happy that you both now own Smosh. Everyone is behind both of you, and your decisions. You’ve come back as a dynamic-duo. You’ve made so many people’s lives more enjoyable and have inspired many.  Thank you all ❤
This is legendary
Been waiting 6 years for this
I was surprised to see this in my recommendations and I’m so glad this was possible! It really feels like a deep conversation face to face. Being completely honest and sharing their sides and understanding feelings! Really a heartfelt moment.
Smosh is the comedy that has structured the comedy I like today molding all of them together to make me who i am today
Smosh literally created a great friendship between me and one of my friends. We would quote videos and make our own poor man’s Smosh skits on my Dads old camcorder.
good ending
We need a new pokemon theme song
I cried. I'm 33yo so i was around their age when they started their channel. I watched them since and to see that Smosh is coming back....I'm so emotional. I'm am so incredibly happy for them. Also a huge huge thank you to Rhett and Link, two other besties that I've been a fan of for years. Class acts that were also excited for Smosh to make a comeback. Thank you thank you.
And so the internet begins to heal
The true question on everyone’s mind is… FOOD BATTLE 2023?
This is like finding out your divorced parents are secretly dating again.
This reminds me a lot of some of my long-running childhood friendships. After all the years and after living on different sides of the country, sometimes I have those thoughts of insecurity, thinking "man, is this friendship over? Are we drifting apart? Do they even like me anymore? Have we changed too much?" And then we talk again, and it's like we never left, and I'm reminded why our friendship has lasted this long. It's always great to see.
Ahhh! This news had me crying happy tears. Love y'all ❤️
I remember getting in trouble for showing my younger brother the "we're in super mario" smosh video bc he got nightmares from it and that was the last smosh video I ever watched.
the homoerotic undertones in their relationship.... i don't make the rules. except i do bc it's my perspective on a relationship that i don't know personally which is shaped by my own experience as a queer person. but also what if they're in love. and not even in a romantic or even sexual way what then
I’m so excited you guys will be back doing just what you love without all the pressure.
Bring back ghetto Smosh
Are Courtney, Shayne, Keith, Noah, Olivia, etc. still gonna be in main channel sketches?
omfg this made me so happy, i remember watching smosh after school everyday, if yall didn't post a new video, i'd rewatch old ones. I didn't have many friends in school and the few friends i did have, i couldn't be myself around with. but watching you guys, two nerdy idiots with childish humur, made me feel less lonely. Thanks for coming back!- Love u guys
Smash was my hole childhood glad to see you both again 😊😅
Nature is healing its self 🥲
My childhood Heroes are together again, what more do i even want?!
Not enough comments about Food Battle 2023
This is so awesome. I found smosh close to Anthony’s departure, so I got to see more dark Anthony and Dark Ian. But I just love seeing how happy they are now. This is going to be amazing. I  Edit: I also want to see the BTS of when they told the cast!
WE NEED A STEVIE COMEBACK!!!
Can I just say how much respect I have for Anthony avoiding the term "Old Smosh" and instead calling it classic... Like it's a really important detail and I feel like it's easy to miss, but it's a much better way of telling us what's to come and I couldn't be more excited.
Wow…. My heart. Seeing you guy’s P****** theme song all the way up to now. It feels crazy!
Its a long hour smosh podcast episode
We better be getting a revival of lunch time with smosh ❤
Love is real.
1:11:29 Im not crying, you are
I’m like this is such a good collab and then remembered that Antony is smosh 😂
I've always had smosh in my peripheral vision, when it was early youtube, when anthony left, when all of a sudden yall had this large crew, to the R&L bailout and to now. Interested in what direction you guys take smosh now. Maybe I'll become a regular viewer, if youtube algorithm would push that content to me *cough*
I KNEW IT BECAUSE OF YOUR VIDEO WITH MATPAT AND THE TITLE WAS I REGRET SELLING MY CHANNEL WILL HE?! 🥳🥳🥳🥳 I KNEWWWW ITTTTTT
I was one of the kids watching 😂 I’m 23 now but we were aware of the vulgarity I saw some kids when I was skating the other day and they’re all yelling out “jizznut” “I like jizz” being vulgar is being part of being a kid 😭😂
WHEN THEY MENTIONED THE MILK FIC I CANT
Who’s here after they bought smosh
fully crying thanks guys
I’m definitely watching this too high
This is just legendary
The Smosh movie was respectfully expected to be bad. I mean that’s kind of the whole point.
I LOVE YOU BOTH DAYUM you guys are responsible for so many of my laughs when i was just starting high school
Smosh inspired 13-year-old me to create content online, and now I'm a full-time indie game developer. This is like my childhood looping back onto itself. I had an old childhood friend that I would watch Smosh with, and we would create our own Smosh-like videos of us doing dumb things together with big dreams of becoming big YouTubers. Unfortunately, as both of us went into High School, he became not a great person and we had a really, really bad falling-out, which led to us never speaking to each other again. I have dreams sometimes of us getting back together and being friends again. This brings me back to that far-gone era of my childhood that I remember as clear as day. I just re-subscribed to Smosh for the first time in ten years. So excited to see where it goes now!
Anthony leaving Smosh was a canon event.
Remember kids, your mental health is the most important thing in your life. Take good care of it.
Please for the love of god Bering back Ian’s character Sargent A noose
Watching this is weird, because on one hand I'm glad to see them as friends again, but on the other hand it almost feels like I shouldn't be watching. This feels like the kinds of intimate moments that shouldn't have to be broadcast to the world, especially after hearing about how much their lives have been affected by the constant need to make content.
Feel like I gotta pinch my arm! Legit thought about this happening the other day and here we are! Glad to have you back guys 👍
The fact that you guys own smosh again brings me so much fucking joy. I'm so happy to see where y'all go with it, because while I'm sure mythical was good for it, it's good to see that company back under who it belongs to.
Let’s burn this to the ground! 💙💙 made me straight up cry 😭
19:21It's really heartbreaking to see you discuss your friendship on how you had to keep it cool for business, but it wasn't your healthy friendship anymore so that Smosh could live... and you said it yourselves, all those mistakes paved the way for a whole lot of YouTubers because you guys were the first. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the decisions that you took that got to this point, both good and bad ones, to see you take steps back and come back up, must had been extra hard
What ya know, they can still make me laugh all these years later
It was saddening to hear Ian’s sentiments on Smosh becoming generic as just being “business” like cmon Ian you should know art and business have a line.
Who’s the Ian guy? I wonder if Anthony has ever met him before? /s
Name a more iconic duo
been watching since 2009. didnt take well to most of the new crew. now im going back to sub to smosh
biggest comback in youtube history
We need Ian Is Bored Vlogs agian
Honestly, back when I watched the Smosh in high school I always had a feeling that if anyone of the pair is going to quit smosh first, I thought it would be Ian. Boy,was I wrong.
The dynamic of Anthony being open and emotional, while Ian stays stone faced and mostly just listening, just works well together. These two just bounce off of each other
So did ian sound kind of aggravated at 44:03 or was he agreeing with Anthony? I’m only asking cause he sounds kind of annoyed
It took me 3 minutes to realize we’re getting a food battle!!!!!
You guys have great chemistry. You should make a channel together.
hell yeah!
Am I the only one that sees they that they were just destroying the already defy😂
Why does Ian look so much like Steve jobs
I am sooooo excited for the future of Smosh!! I could cry 😭😭 I would kill for footage of them telling the Smosh crew that this was happening!!
I’ve been watching smosh since the Pokémon lip sync you guys were one of the first YouTube channels I found. Hearing that you guys own smosh again is so heartwarming I can’t wait to see what the future holds ❤❤
This feels like longtime friends reuniting after years of being apart………..because it literally is!
I haven't thought of the milk foic in such a long time,,WHY WOULD YOU REMIND ME
this is some good fucking content
LETSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOO!!! My child me is crying that they’re back
I am legitimately floored by this announcement. I am SO HAPPY
Also, I find it funny that this comes out just a month after the Mat Patt interview.
Here before this is #2 on trending
Someone tag chanse
Glad to see them back together ❤
been watching smosh since 2009. watched yall split. continued to follow. seeing this has been eye opening with even my own arts. doing content alone is tough but with others it opens a whole nother world. very emotional seeing you guys back. you guys made youtube for me. couldnt be happier.
Let's goooo! Does this mean we could get a food battle 2024?
I love seeing them discuss their past now they got past it and OMG THEY BOUGHT SMOSH 😦
My childhood is restored
I was waiting for this interview for so long
HOW THE TABLES HAVE TURNED
I never thought this day would come that they would get back together it warms my heart and I wish them all the luck in the world
This is great and YouTube wouldn’t be what it is today without these 2.
:D
I’m officially old
Who's this guy
my brain short-circuited and i was thinking, "oh how come anthony didn't interview the other one from Smosh? What was his name again...?" and then i went, "OH WAIT I AM DUMB--"
yes yes yes god yes
The amount of nostalgia and hope i have about this whole thing is overwhelming. There are so many good things coming and im so fucking happy OH MY GOD <3
Motherf*ckers made me cried a little bit this time.
Iron Man and Captain America back together💪
I missed seeing these 2 guys who have been friends since the 6th grade, in a video together... Smosh is finally back!!!!!❤
its wild that when i saw this i didnt go "oh man anthony and ian back together!" i went "man its cool anthony is interviewing the smosh guy" like you have reinvented yourself so well i momentarily forgot you used to be on smosh lol
I was there from the LisaNova, DaxFlame, Lonelygirl15, etc days and I'm excited the legends are back.
The amount of memories and nostalgia this interview brings back
Ooooh. 47 seconds in and then I realized it was Anthony Padilla (from that one Youtube Channel) and Ian Hecox (from Smosh)
OHHHHH MY GODDDDDDD BEST VIDEO EVER HELPPPP
Ian is such daddy material now 👀
Iconic
So i may have been one of the children who shouldn't have watched smosh from early on but im an adult now and its still as hilarious. Im an adult for the comeback?
I enjoyed the movie. Watched it twice
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
If I remember correctly you guys were the first channel I subbed too. You guys were the reason I made a YouTube channel.
Ian has a long way to go still but I hope they both grow stronger in their friendship ❤
we’ve been waiting since you started
I grew up on these 2 doing the stupidest shit. Glad that they finally have smosh back
i’m so thrilled. i’m so glad how the channel has been can be better than ever and focus on what’s working best and the channels roots can come back at the best time ever working how REALLY works.
Love Ian's choice of 80's porn star fashion. Man is definitely hung.
It's such an awesome thing to see you guys coming back together. You don't know how many OG fans are very happy right now.
YEEAAAAAH BABY, THATS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THATS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT, WOOOOOO.
I grew up watching Smosh. Hearing about all this made my day, im excited that we got the old Smosh back. Im also excited for what content will appear in the future, love u guys
such a profound interview after growing up watching smosh in the early days
So happy to see two bros coming together again, really glad you guys got smosh back.
!!!!!
SHUT UP
Watching this 19:28 I felt like Anthony wanted to say something different, I noticed it on other moments as well
FOOD BATTLE 🍩
The milk fanfic revives horrid memories
Wonder if any of the old cast would return.
I grew up with these two guys. It's wild knowing that this was going on behind the senses. And as a stupid kid I thought everything with them was how they portrait it. I honestly hope they get to the point where they were back then. It's a low chance but hopefully they do.
Couldn't have asked for a better early birthday present. Seeing the two of you together again makes my heart smile <3
This whole video gave me so much closure that I needed for so long. :’)
This episode looks like when i talk to my ex
Smosh is back!!!!!
molestor moon was a good sketch on smosh!
Nature is healing. Crazy to see these two together after so long. I look forward to the future!
THIS!! The interview I've been DYING FOR all these year! ALL my questions answered! I am now complete! 🧘‍♂️
❤❤❤❤❤❤
When Defy destroyed itself and Smosh kept on going.. they thought, those fuckers. That is why I respect the hell out of Rhet and Link, They stepped up and saved a company that basically made Youtube explode
"Even if we burn it to the ground. I am happy to do it with you."   No joke that's like the sweetest moment of friendship I have ever heard.
SMOSH IS BACK??????????
FOOD BATTLE
That burn it to the ground part was so sweet.
CANON
Not me on the verge of TEARS remembering the first time I discovered youtube with Food Battle 2009 😭😭😭
SHUT UP! ?🎉😮❤
Classic Smosh is back baby!!
You guys never mentioned the time LeVar Burton bought Smosh, too!  In all seriousness, this was the most wholesome way to start this insanely exciting new chapter! Stoked to see what you guys create from here!
Tonight on Smosh: Divorced Gay Parents Rekindle Their Love For Each Other
yess!!! i love u guys
Wait a darn second, I KNOW THIS GUY. fr tho, glad to see them reunite 👍
It is incredible that despite having gone your separate ways, the two of you, the best duo on the internet, meet again, but not because it has to be that way, or because they denoted it that way, but because as adults who have grown on your own decide to join again to share that fragment of your lives with us, really thank you very much for all your work all these years
The rise, fall and rise again of an empire
It’s like my childhood returning. It won’t be completely the same but seeing you two back together will be magical 😊 I grew up watching your videos and always go back to re watch them, even to this day. Hope you’ll entertain this new generation as well. Can’t wait :)
As a 28 year old who grew up watching nothing but YouTube. I love you guys I'm glad y'all are still friends.
Let’s goooooooo way too hyped
at first I kinda doubt this reunion, seeing how awkward they act, how formal they talk, how they try to not offend each other but in the same time talk a long laundry list of things they dislike with each other. That's not how friends talk. but when they start talking about the new smosh, the first video they shot for the new channel... I think they're finally back.
My one take away from this:  They don't like The Smosh Movie
I'm currently going through some shit kidney surgeries and like 1 hour after waking up from Anastasia I saw the announcement and now a day or so after the surgery I sit up in the hospital bed and see this video in my feed and it's fucking made my week so much better. I know you said you didn't just wanna do old content but god I would fucking love food battle or Anthony's Pokémon journey in real life to continue. Could maybe have all the new cast involved in the food battle and have food battle royale.
MY CHILDHOOOODODDDDD
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I just hope y'all don't push out the new cast on the main channel
YES, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS FOR THESE 2 REUNITE
This is like the most wholesome full circle healing love libe video all smoshed into one. ❤
The promo you guys are doing is great 😆
small detail: even appart they started colour co-ordinating their outfits. like ian went to light warm colours and anthony went to dark cool olours. honestly really intresting to notice how they're still identifyably a duo even after half a decade.
Is there a chance that lunchtime with smosh is back????
friendship always wins
FOOD BATTLE 2023!!!
I hope y’all are celebrating SO FUCKING HARD for this amazing achievement!!! Love that you guys are working together and hanging out together again for the foreseeable future :)
Im crying like seriously right now,happy for both of you. Been watching smosh for 12 years. Thks ian and anthony thk you for bring this memories came back.😊
The freaking intro just made me cry, love to see ian with you again 😢
Kids these days didn't even know what (real) smosh was until now
i used to genuinely grab food and eat food with you guys when you would release those smosh meal time videos where y’all would open fan mail or just talk
OMG
Porta dos Fundos entered the sketch comedy chat
Finally the one we’ve all been waiting for
i remember writing i shoot a MoFo in the throat with my bow and my mom being horrified, yall should remix that music vid. thank god yall are back together creating. thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!!!!
I WISH THEY HAD A HEART REACTION!!!!
Thank you so much for this interview. As a long time smosh fan, obviously it was devastating when Anthony left but have long since came to terms with Anthony and Ian continuing on their own paths seperately since abviously I dont want them to create content at their own expense. I was just hoping that it didnt destroy their friendship too badly. So seeing you guys here today, talking a little bit about what went on behind all those years is such a wonderful thing. I dont care what happens moving forward but I only hope for your success and happiness ❤❤❤ Congratulations on Smosh guys! Bless Rhett and Link as well 🎉
Loving every second
WE'REEEEE HEALINGGGG, THANK YOU, DADDIES! ❤
After the hug and ian saying "and then we kiss afterwards" did i just see Anthony give a *We could* head nod??
FRIENDSHIP ALWAYS WINS
This is Drake and Josh but if the actors didn't hate each other behind the cameras.
FOOD BATTLE!
This was a whole therapy session long needed. Happy to see you two reconnect stronger and back together as Smosh again :)
i was unexpected 😅
Wow this is so cool to see two of my favorite Youtubers finally meet!
aw rahh
Rhett and Link living up to their Internet Dads title to the _fullest_ here. Love them so much and I'm so happy that smosh is officially back.
This reminds me so much of my relationship with my brother, we were so close during childhood, now it’s almost like we’re strangers in a family. This inspires me to do have similar conversation with him ❤
I Really Missed These Two Together, I Have Been Subscribed To Smosh Since 2007 And It’s Crazy How I’m Subscribed But I Haven’t Really Kept Up With The Channel Since Anthony Left 😢
so cute
Ian looks like pewds....
Even if Smosh is not back, I am just happy they can have a heart to heart talk and be good friends.
I hope this new rekindle of this friendship will bring a new age for the both of them to make something unforgettable.   and finally an end to the long-awaited tie breaker from the summer/winter games being 2-2 for each of them and who took the pink frosting sprinkle donut in the food battle.
All the YouTubers back then were getting mobile games and movies
Me and my friends still watch smosh the movie all the time, it’s hilarious how bad it is but we also just love you guys, still quote butt massage girl to this day
Saw the latest Try Not to Laugh and you two had fantastic energy together.
Hopefully they do answer questions  and first bite! When they eat something lol
I literally screamed when Ian’s mom came back 😂
Never thought I’d see the day
I liked the smosh movie
The king's are back in the throne
Man Ian went through a lot.... He was immediately forced to be ok in a very strange time. Rhett and Link really came through for them.
this is fucking insane omg. im so glad this has happened. congrats to anthony and ian 🎉
a huge thing i grow up with smoosh and they espoused me to interesting things
I might cry.. I grew up watching these two legends and seeing how not only the channel's content and comedy deteriote but also Anthony and Ian's friendship as well was heartbreaking. So happy to see that these two have grown so much and now are conversing again. Will support these two in any endeavour they go with!
I don’t know if these 2 truly understand the big of an impact these guys had on the entire internet as a whole, I’m really proud for them to take back what they lost so long ago
This is my actual childhood these people are my childhood entertainment
I'm so happy to see that you two are back at home in Smosh! I've been watching since the channel first started, and I've missed the magic y'all create together.
Who else is ready for Anthony's funeral?
I called this and I wish I would've spoke 4 hours ago.
It's insane how the smosh channel is older than me by 6 months
Holy shit my childhood is back
So what’s next?
Such a good year, Wassabi and Smosh came back together!!!
It's so incredible to have some sense of closure as to how everything went down and where things are going. Also, is it just me or is Ian totally daddy in this video?
1:11:32 AWW!! 💕
This is easily the biggest YT moment in history and you can't change my mind
just one?
The end hug was cringe then it turned around with the dance hug lmao
Anthony’s impression of Ian is spot on and it just shows how good of friends they’ve always been ❤
lol !
This is nice to see, but is it just me or does Ian still seem a bit jaded?
SHUT UP
Smosh was my childhood and teenhood
The milk fanfic!!!! Nooooooo
So do we know if Anthony is still going to make videos on this channel when he returned to Smosh?
I want emo Anthony back...
i've watched these guys since 2012, what's the milk fanfic?!
This is enough to make a grown man cry.
no way bro
I loved that hug
Such a nostalgic collab. I remember watching your videos in 2012 ❤
The part where Anthony said he spent so many years looking back and regretting their past decisions, and then now realizing it all had to happen that way for them to reunite…. was really special. Best of luck you guys!
The one thing I'm worried about going forward with smosh's return is the new power dynamic between Ian and Anthony. Where Ian has stuck to his roots and somewhat stagnated from it, Anthony has since set out on his own and flourished because of it. When smosh was started, it was just two young dudes wanting to make a youtube channel. Idk, maybe I'm talking up nothing, and I certainly hope for the best, but the fear is there  PS bring back food battle or im doxxing yall
BRO 1:11:30 THAT SHIT WAS FUCKING WHOLESOME 😭😭😭
I love how uncut this is. Obviously there are edits and cuts but it feels so candid and I love it
Full circle, better than ever. Both of you are incredible and I can't wait to see what this new era brings
Ian at the end: "If we burn it to the ground, im happy to do that with you" I felt that 🥺❤
Ahhh I am so excited to see what smosh does next but above all I'm happy you guys are happy!
Never really watched Smosh. Just happy to see people passionate about what they doing being able to do so again on the platform/channel that started it all after many trials and tribulations. Good luck to you all and have fun!
now kiss.
YESSSSS
I never thought I would see the day that this would happen 😱💖💜
I’ve had the biggest smile all day welcome back boys.
I miss the old smosh games gta, been a fan since I was like 13 and now I'm an adult, feels crazy
This is so surreal. Love you guys.
Ian was as much Anthony's Muse as Anthony was Ian's Muse
god i love them (and rhett and link) so bad it ACHES
I wonder if Smosh Cartoons is coming back 🤔
man that bone cracking at the end was that real or edited 💀
I remember being shown smosh videos so long ago and enjoying them so much, watching all their videos. I got to a point where i had seen all of the videos when i was younger and didnt pay attention to them after i finished all of them at the time. like 15 YEARS later i stumble upon Anthony's I spend a day with series and start really enjoying it, thinking hmmm, this guy is kinda familiar.... then it hits me. holy shit its one of the smosh guys, i didnt recognize him with the straightened emo boy hair. now after watching Anthony's channel and series the boys are back. its come full circle.
This brought me so much joy. I’ve always watched smosh throughout my life. It’s blissful humour that I enjoy. I’m excited for this collaboration. ❤ Also love the support from Rhett and Link. It all hits me in the feels.
Wow. Huge props to Rhett and Link for all they've done to save Smosh and bring it back. Sometimes you just need someone to take care of you and protect you while you're down and then set you free again when you're ready.
As an old smosh viewer I was sooo skeptic but I actually have hope and am excited for what they are gonna do
I did not realize I watched 1 hr of this sheeesh it was so good
I know this sounds dumb, but the movie was one of the first smosh things I ever watched.
So smosh coming back?
Really appreciate the radical honesty expressed by both Ian and Anthony here. What a day for my inner child!!
I was introduced to Smosh at 10 years old by my older brother, with my first video being the newest video at the time; Food Battle 2010, and I pretty much INSTANTLY fell in love with the channel!
I'm happy to see you guys working together again. Super excited for the future of Smosh!
I need Anthony in WHO Meme’d It and Beopardy
Wow.
"Even if we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do it with you." INSTANT TEARS
I cant believe this and the smosh channel bwing bought by you guys is happening in two days
i wonder if a modern smosh is funny. I loved smosh when I was in middle school, decided to look back at the channel and found myself cringing more than laughing at the jokes haha. Assassins creed song is classic though. And if there is no food battles IM NOT INTERESTED
yay
Wow these guys have amazing chemistry with each other! As if they known each other forever!
🥲
Drink everytime they say smosh
I'm happy that they're doing this, but also getting the impression that their relationship is still strained or awkward in some way. I genuinely hope things work our for these two, and for Smosh.
Wow comedy duo...
Let’s all go binge watch old smosh videos to make them money.🫨💵💵
Idk man but Ian lowkey looks hotter to me than Anthony now
I am so emotional right now I love you guys
Waking up to this feels like christmas has come early!
I'm sadly one of the people that didn't grew up with Smosh. But, I loved the Vids from before and to see Fresh new Sketches is exciting to see 😁
nature is healing y’all
I don’t know anything about old smosh. I know Anthony as his own dude. I know him as the smart, pretty, and accepting guy who spreads a positive message.
Those silly Smosh boys are back together again. 😁
The pokemon lipsync video was my childhood intro to YouTube and it STILL plays in my head most weeks as a 33yr old hahahahha
This means the world to see this actually happen and for smosh to be back.   Thank you🥹
🥹🥹
rhett and link were the perfect people to hold onto smosh they held on to it because they knew one day it’d be back
please give us a summer games
i love you guys so much
I was one of those children haha
SMOSH IS BACK THATS CRAZY
I love watching boys do therapy 😍😍
YOOO
I’ve bought a membership! I really want Smosh to succeed!! I’ve been a fan for YEARS and I’m so excited to see Anthony and Ian working together agaib
I have always thought this, and will always think this, IAN IS SOOOOO HANDSOME
I like how this started off with Anthony being super pessimistic about Smosh and Ian being optimistic. Then when they regrouped and pitched the idea to buy Smosh and write sketch comedy again, Anthony lit up and was super optimistic meanwhile Ian was skeptical and pessimistic, believing it wouldn’t work
I outgrew Smosh a while ago, when they were still telling us to Shut Up! In the beginning of the video. Ive watched a few videos here and there since, but never quite stuck around. Regardless, this is really cool to see. Wish nothing but the best for you guys, Im sure this is super exciting for both of you. Never shouldve left your guys hands, but it was a different era
I've spent my teen years watching your videos and ressonating with your type of humor. Me and my friends even made our own version of the Pokemon theme video (in portuguese).   I was there when the channel began to change into something I was not that interested into anymore, but I never truly stopped coming back to check it out every now and then. I have even followed Anthony during his solo career and experienced a lot of his "spent the day with" series with genuine interest.    In the meantime I got married. Had a daughter. Started my current job.   This moment feels like a brilliant conclusion of a long convoluted story and, at the same time, a new fresh start for you guys.   I'm excited for this new venture. Hope it goes well. But even if it doesn't, Im glad to see you guys connect again and try it out!  Best of luck!
please say we’re getting food battles again 😭
the sacramento news clip reminds me of home that reporters voice is like forever engraved in my brain lmao. cool to see smosh back!
Honestly I have so fucking much to say, but I'll just say this, Smosh was the firsts videos I ever found funny and gave me a love of acting and comedy while the Smosh songs especially Assassins Creed 3 gave the love of music I have now! Honesty Smosh helped me become the best parts of myself and a lot of my videos are meant to my way of making old smosh stuff and that kinda stuff helped me stay happy and showed me what I love doing. I don't know what to say or how to say it but thanks Anthony and Ian, thanks for inspiring and shaping me, Smosh will always be a part me. <3
My sad time has been made better, Ian and Anthony have reunited omggg
This is like that time seinfeld had that reunion.
As a couple of wise philosophers once wrote:  “NAKED AND YOUR PARENTS COME HOME! WHAT THE FIRETRUCK!  And  “Grab ya girl and get some Dixon Cider”
As cringe as smosh was, it brought smiles, laughter and a distraction to 12 year old me who was seriously struggling. YouTube genuinely saved me from becoming a statistic and i cannot thank all the OG YouTubers enough.
Our boys are back, traumabonded, and stronger than ever
This is less. Anthony spent a day with Ian and more. We spent a day with smosh
How cathartic this episode is
just two healthy well-adjusted adults. i love it
man i still cant believe what i just watched on smosh hollly shiaduhasieoauiseitttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
Just saying if food battles don’t come back I will cry
I enjoyed watching Anthony find his own voice yeah it took a month for him to get comfortable but him not giving up I'm glad he didn't
Aaahh history
Ngl, I had heard of SMOSH but had never watched SMOSH until like late 2019. It was the TNTL with WWE's New Day.  Y'all ended up helping me get through the darkest days of COVID and the Pandemic.  I get trying to recapture the lightning in a bottle that was old SMOSH, but let's please not forget new SMOSH.
color me stoked
the time has come finally uffff
smosh is getting back together. Now we just need danplan and actually stephen to be friends again😢  Bloopers r tight 😙👌
Congrats on owning SMOSH again! I feel like a young man again!
The iconic duo is back🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is completely insane that you guys are back together. You made up so much of my childhood and I felt sad when I started to disconnect from the content after it had started to change. When Anthony left originally I always wondered what he'd do and he made a name for himself and Ian stayed dedicated to Smosh despite the changes that were happening. I am so happy to see that even after all that growth it still lead back to you guys creating content together again and I can't to wait to see what the growth creates now that you're back together again. Keep creating amazing stuff!!! Love you both so much!!!
This video has healed me internally. I love both of you and waited so long ❤
Wow…this aged me! I fully remember watching SMOSH with my BFF from middle school and high school…
After I this I want a "I spent a day with Rhett and link"
I never thought this day would come and I couldn’t be happier ❤ this is exactly what the platform needed right now and I’m so happy to hear that they both have healed and grown through all of this.
Misses this duo
The boys are hanging out again
HAPPY DAYS
Happy to see y'all back together. Legends of the internet back at it again.
New Box man?!?!
THEY OWN SMOSH AGAIN!!!!!! YESSSSSSS!!!!!!
the ultimate ship
Been a fan of Smosh since I was a kid, so it’s amazing to see you guys in a video again! ❤
Hope it works out but honestly, nobody wants to actually pay for anything. Hope the content is so good people want to pay for it.
Wow so Ian is the mature one and Anthony is the insecure A hole 😂 Who would’ve thunk it.   Well I hope he grew from it. The fact it took Anthony that long to get over things is a bit sad, he’s a bit full of himself, but I’m glad he finally got there. I’m excited to see where things go, I’m not subscribed to this dude anymore, and it’ll stay that way but I do appreciate the honesty through out this interview.  I’ll stick to watching Smosh 😅
Its cool to see what your doing to smosh again. Seeiing you two together is really weird but exciting💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
The child in me is screaming! ♥️♥️
This is a historic day for youtube!
This made my week! I'm sooo happy!
When I saw the video in my reccomended I thought I was having a dream Holy this is so cool seeing them back together again, even if it is just for a little bit
Best thing to happen to YouTube in a long time.
I cried a little, this is cute
I was in middle school when they split up. This is like a nostalgia nuke!
I spent a day with.............. is a series where Anthony learnt about someone or something about someone but this episode, yeah they knew each other so well already
never thought this sweet video would end with a discussion of the milk fic. thank you.
I have actually been waiting for this video for a long time
Just put them into a bar together and get them drunk already so they can express their love for each other!
I just want to take a second and thank Ian for holding hope and doing everything he could to keep Smosh alive long enough for all of us to be here for this moment! This moment was so needed. When Anthony said "my childhood friend that I grew up with is still here." While choking back tears is the best way to describe how this news has made me feel today. 😭😭😭
I held it all together until Ian's line about burning it down...
Thanks god both of you could reunite again.
So… no more food battle? :3
Oh my gos
I first started watching smosh when I was 11 I remember when Anthony left, that was when I stopped watching. I’m 20 now and it’s like a trip through nostalgia. Watching and listening to them talk about their past in a mature perspective is really mind opening  and meaningful. I can’t wait to see more of them in the future, this was really the collab of the decade!
This can bring a tear to my eye.
1;11:36 😭😭😭 THIS MOMENT MY HEART I CANT
The canon event that has been long overdue. So beautiful to see you guys together. Food Battle 2023!
I think this genuinely needs to be said, massive props to Ian for maintaining his hopeful demeanor about the channel even while Defy Media was giving them a really shitty workload and after Anthony left. He really did care about Smosh and saw something in it, even if people like Anthony or fans weren't into it, he still saw something and kept to his guns and I really appreciate it. The fact that he even still stayed after Anthony suggested that he should leave to, that takes massive balls to not only not join your best friend/business partner but to be the sole head of Smosh, where everything is on him. If Ian had given up along with Anthony, none of this would've probably happened. Ian and Anthony would probably still remain distant, Smosh would just continue to have this generic corporate identity, and nobody wins in the end, but thanks to Ian still maintaining that hope for Smosh, we've reached the best possible outcome today, 2 best friends taking back ownership of something they made as young teens and now a lot more experienced in their own ways of comedy and joining together again years later. Massive congrats to you both, Ian and Anthony. I've watched your videos ever since I was 11 and am 23 now. Seeing you both grow as I've grown up, I couldn't be happier to see you guys still making us laugh. Best of luck, we're with you all the way.
great connection!  deepest ep from anthony!  jake and amir, rhett and link, now these boys
Literall legends!
Cold ones could never
food battle 2024?
Stoked to watch this!
I was literally just thinking of smosh and this popped up 😭 I loved smosh, it was definitely a core memory of my childhood
Smosh was built on friendship, passion, and creativity, that's why to Anthony, it will never be just business.   I can't speak for you Anthony, but it's what I see.  Congratulations 🎉
Massive W
You know I been waiting for this moment and I'm glad we finally got to this point I really missed them together and getting to see them both  in a good mental place seeing them both happy is very wholesome coming full circle watching them both grow into adults but I want a relationship like this though got a great bond
I will be getting a membership the teen in me needs it, this is sick. I grew up watching you guys the same time I was watching like SpongeBob.
*Following Rhett & Link, Smosh, Anthony, and Ian for literally over a decade now and being here in this moment is insane.* Like seriously, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this. Congrats to Ian and Anthony!
Smosh fans eating good rn
🍩the goats are back
I just want to say I really resonate with your story. Losing important friendships is life altering and painful -no matter the cause. It takes a lot of courage to admit fault and be open and I was able to do that in my own life and it’s amazing to see that not all friendships have to be lost. Thanks Ian and Anthony for being so open. ❤
I think I'm crying 🤧😂
I'm legit crying watching this interview. I whooped when i saw the announcement with the four way handshake between you guys and Rhett and Link. 😭🫶 I'm so happy for you both. I'm looking forward to the new and improved Smosh, whatever that will look like. I've been here since 2013 and seeing this beautiful interaction between the two of you feels really cathartic for some reason lol. I know you'll never see this comment but i just had to say what i feel. I'm still subbed to Smosh and i immediately subbed to this channel when it went up cause i always loved giving you all watch time. ❤🎉 Congratulations, boys.
This intervention made me realize why I loved smosh growing up
We got a Alex and Roi comeback and now we got a Anthony and Ian comeback too?!! Bro is life getting better or what?? 😭❤
history
This just feels so cathartic. Hearing about what really went down between these two and actually seeing them in the same room together for the first time in years gives me a sense of closure, and really makes me smile, which is not easy these days lol. Even if this new version of Smosh doesn't do as well as we're hoping, I think it's worth it to see you guys reconcile and create things together again!
Besties are back!!!
I'm glad to hear the news that you guys finally got your channel back and forever now🎉🎉🎉 next year going to be awesome . And glad to see you guys still cool.  It's like if bitblock josh and Nick made videos together again.  Man it be awesome to see you guys and the old crew made a reunion episode on Anthony channel
It felt like we never really got closure when Anthony left. But now not only did we get closure but we got the reunion we’ve been wanting for years😭 y’all just made an entire generation so happy
This feels like the best ending in a video game. Been watching since I was 8 back in 2010, and it’s almost surreal thinking that my favorite duo growing up is gonna get to do what they love together again. Sweet af… now kith
the interview was so nice guys! im excited!!
I remember coming home from school, sitting in my garage with a bunch of my friends on the block, and watching the newest Smosh video that had come out that day. The fact that they’re creating content again is amazing, but then getting back together as friends is unbelievably inspirational
Smosh the movie was basically a feature length smosh skit which was good enough for me that just liked the videos. Probably not worth the extra budget but still decent
After all these years I just noticed the refused posters in Anthony's bedroom 2:54
Those who know, know
I'm so glad that my dads are back again, you guys raised me since 4th grade and now I'm in college and I got emotional when I saw the posts today
Our two Youtube dads finally getting back together after Anthony went out for milk.
When's the next food battle
The collab we don’t deserve, but the one we needed
AHHH WHATTTTTT???? WAIT-I WHAT?
This is the closure that my teenage self needed. 😭💛 I love seeing you two coming together and just having the space to talk everything out
I love that Ian is dressed like a slice of cheese pizza.
Omg thx!!!!
So thankful you both made the decisions you did.  The period you were apart will make your partnership stronger.
FOOD BATTLE 23  FOOD BATTLE 23
Crying, having gone through childhood watching your videos to present day where I lost a friend, a lot more actually. This hits home on what I need to do, currently. I think compartmentalization was a great term that Ian brought up that I just resonated with completely. Also just allowing that fun we had together sit quietly while something that was shameful and I look back and regret myself for, still haven’t been forgetting both those things while stepping forward to possible new fun opportunities, new and/or familiar. I don’t know if anyone would read this I was just venting on my part, cheers. Looking forward to your future projects IAN HECOX and ANTHONY PADILLA of SMOSH tm.
i'm relieved to hear that Pit and Games will be left more or less untouched
Ian was angry because he lost his best friend. But it's all good now
Excited for Smosh Movie: The Sequel
I have worried for the past 5 years wondering if they are still friends and now all this happened, I am still in shock, today has felt super super long.
People who watched nigahiga’s podcast knew this was coming
Posting in an epic thread.
I don’t watch either Ian or Anthony separately mainly cause their breakup of smosh actually made me sad and now I’m finally ready to see the magic duo on screen again
Damn, I never thought that this would happen but it made me so happy like holy fucking shit thats crazy! Much love! <3
I wanna see Steve Zaragoza and Mike Flazone on new Smosh sooo bad
I can't wait for a Try Not to Laugh where Shayne screams "Where's Anthonyyy?!!!" And Anthony is in the one in the chair. "Anthony! You're my favorite pizza place."
1:11:30 burn it to the ground!
The thumbnail that caused the shitting of a thousand bricks.
I will hon the record to say that Smosh: the Movie was hilarious and I have willingly watched it at least 3 times. Is it good? God no. Is it fun? Hell yeah.
Knew it was only a matter of time
Feels like I just watched an hour long therapy session. But in some way, it sort of was.  Also, "If we burn it to the ground, I am happy to do that with you." Was very sweet in it's own twisted way.
is this what closure feels like?
doesnt even fully feel like an interview, it feels like bros getting back together and having a heart to heart about the past
😢
I have this weird grin on my face the whole time and I can't explain it. Such a wholesome announcement
We are so back baby
So this means lunchtime with smosh is coming back, right?  Right?
The biggest thing that Ian's ever done and the biggest thing to happen to YouTube. Congratulations to the both of you! Welcome back!
Ayo anthony really is gay
Would LOVE to see more Smosh Libs!
as soon as I saw the smosh announcement ive been waiting for this
This feels kind of surreal, doesn't it?
Nostalgia? I went to watch “box man’s girlfriend” real quick. Nah. That’s actual great content. People calling it nostalgia needs help.
"Let's burn this to the ground" broke me You know we will be here supporting in every step of the way, tbh I didn't ask for this, but I really needed it
I half expected the interview to start serious and then they just sit there for an hour.
I can’t wait for Smoshs other Dad to meet his new kids 🥹
I never been so happy in my life
I’m childhood was smosh ❤
Did Ian have a huge zit on his cheek? He kept touching it.
Oh my god this is amazing
Is Ian a little harsh and emotionless ?
nice
the world needed this
1:11:37 ❤
My childhood . Awesome to see y’all back . I really hope to see collaboration but without deteriorating your health and relationships.
Bro does it look like I’m crying i’m just cutting onions. . . Don’t look at me 🫤😭😭😭😭
Luv y'all fr
This is a great open minded video that was long over do because when most watch smosh at a young age and we didn’t understand the business stand point but thanks to this video we can see their life experience which show how these celebrities are human and how there reason for their separation is a valid one and goes more in depth Thank you Anthony and Ian
I’m happy to see those 2 together again but the fact they now own Smosh what does that mean for Trevor and Josh from Mythical Kitchen? Will we never see them again on smosh? I mean Josh and Shayne’s chemistry is off the roof they like bigbro and lilbro… Trevor is practically a Smosh meme creator as of now and he’s a Chosen from an other dimension… I love the fact Anthony is Back but I wonder what it’s gonna mean for the future. Will Ian still do let’s do that? Will Antony have his own little skit show like Ian? Anyhow… I’m Glad Anthony is back can’t wait to see what ya’ll gonna do and hope that everything goes well!
This brings back so many memories of the saga that smosh has built. I'm so glad that their friendship has rekindled and isn't just business sided. I got so emotional watching them talk, like a therapy session between both of them. Here's to many years of bigger and better memories!! (also congrats on officially both owning the company back again)
this inspires me to reconnect with people i have lost contact with
Wow, just got the closure I never knew I needed
Anthony giggling for a solid minute made me laugh 😁 also ive watched Smosh since 2008 when i just got into college at 17, this reunion sent me back to my teenage years aaaaaaaaa  Also i didnt know there was a rift betwen y'all friendship, ive always thought you guys were conpletely cool with each other after anthony left smosh
This. Is. Everything. This is growing up. My heart is full.
the smosh movie was undeniably bad; but that honestly made it enjoyable. it was this stupid, silly movie with youtubers i loved.
Food battle 2023 coming soon?
OH MY GODD
The tittle of this video should be renamed from: "I spent a day with IAN HECOX" to "I spent over 15 years with IAN HECOX"
We also need a catch up session with old cast!!!!
You guys should sell it to Levar Burton
This is my version of Tom DeLonge rejoining Blink-182 🥹
This is the way
Now we need the sequel - I spend a day with Ian's Mom
oh?? my gosh????? im so excited for this??????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my 8-year-old self is jumping around :)
When I saw the Smosh video, I knew this was gonna be here too.
Jason David Frank from power rangers is dead.
All we see nowadays are artists and creators getting fucked and loosing the rights to their own creations. It feels amazing to see this.
Rhett and Link are legends for this though. Love them to death.
OUR BOYS BACK TOGETHER 🥲
WE DID IT!!! SHANE WAS RIGHT TO ASK, WE FOUND WHERE ANTHONY WAS!!!
"If we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do it with you."  God damnnnn man, got me tearing up.  Seriously though, as long as you two are *this* happy about it, and having fun, people are going to feel that.   I wouldn't have believed that Smosh was back, or that it could *ever* last again-- without seeing just how *happy* you two were in the announcement video.  There was this genuine feeling of joy between you two, and this sense that you guys were loving eachother's company again.  With how much the internet has grown, it's gonna be awesome to see what you guys can do, and I'm all here for it.
SMOSH IS BACK SMOSH IS BACK YAYAYAYA
SMOOOOOSH IS BAAAACK !!!
I love the love in this friendship. It's so genuine and clearly true. I love how each supports the other. You can see it in the responses and the way the conversation works. I'm so happy for this. ❤
These guys have good chemistry, they should make a youtube channel together
This is beautiful. Two men having an honest and vulnerable conversation about their friendship, i love it. You guys are seriously inspirational, I can see young boys finding this really helpful ❤
Are the funeral roasts going to continue on smosh? they're really the only thing I watch from the channel so I hope they stick around
"What if we bought Smosh?" is Clerks2 coded
Man so inspiring honestly man
Smosh, no matter how it changed throughout the years will always have a special place in my heart. Smosh is the first channel I ever subbed to back in 2014 and it's just so great hearing you two got back together as buddies again.. <3 u both so much. can't wait to see  u guys making videos together again on the main channel. we are back baby!!!
it's good to see you guys position and inner thoughts about everything you guys created.
YOOOOO
Just two men being vulnerable kings together. We missed you guys. Proud of you.
My favorite videos were when you guys would react and watch your old videos I would cry laughing because my friends and I were the same way.
So no Food Battle 2023?
shoutout rhett and link! a comment for the algo
Bruh you mentioned the milk fanfic and the end and holy shit your unlocked a memory I did not want. I remember I was dared to read it
everything was nice and nostalgic and then the fkn MILK FIC was brought up *i had managed to forget the milk fic*
I recently foudn smosh like three weeks ago , i knw it existed but never truly watched it , so this is my first time seeing ian so serious and chill
This is so beautiful to see I literally grew up watching you guys back in the day and I’m so excited to see you guys back in action ❤
You guys.. I was a smosh kid. I was so into them I would watch Lunchtime and Mailtime with smosh SO MUCH! I also had food battle shirts! It's so nice to see their genuine selves come out when they are together ♥️
waaaa
kidnapping survivors gonna be butthurt
Best. Episode. Ever.
Thank y'all for sharing this with all of us.
Que regrese Patrick en ElSmosh😢
Crying rn
They bought smosh back wtf
I really wanna know what shoes Ian is wearing. Honestly super dope.
OMGGGGGG SMOSH IS BACK!!!
never tried to hold back tears for so long
First Rhett and Link revived their main channel, now classic Smosh is coming back! This is like the OG YouTube renaissance.
Wow. Congrats. Glad to see both of you back. You guys have been a staple of my youtube habit.... and missed you. I still watch SMOSH and Mr. Padilla as well.... you guys have always been great. Here to your success in a great future❤❤❤❤
I became a fan "new smosh" era. Ian you fuckin nailed it im so proud of u kept smosh alive and well through all of that til the day you could reunite, i am absolutely!!!!!!! Stoked!!!!!!!!! And you're both looking better than ever like nah well done bois bloody well done
Thank you Lord Jesus Christ for reuniting these two in friendship 🙏
Sometimes you need to have time away from a friend to grow into better people and if you reconnect when the time is right, you know it was meant to be. Im really excited for whats to come and i am so beyond happy for you both 🥹🎉 also what is the milk fanfic...? 👀
They are pretty opposite, esp in how they communicate, but they compliment each other so well! It seems like they just understand each other. Ian does not have to get too descriptive with his emotions and Anthony can fill in the blanks or stuff that may be unsaid. At the same time, Ian can be logical but empathetic. Great video 👍🏻 welcome back guys <3
THIS IS CINEMA
What about molester moon 2?
Anthony needs to interview Rhett and link now...
This is a beautiful full circle
Even the way they're dressed - one side dark, the other side light - truly yin and yang. Or, as the way I immediately saw it when I saw Anthony and Ian's faces/hairstyles in the same shot: the good ending of Revenge of the Sith i.e., if Anakin had returned to the light (not meant to be a commentary) and the two of them got to be brothers again. I'm so happy for them! :)
Wow, after all these years, Ian's get well soon card turned out to be the source of strength for Anthony to continue. It's been a long time, but he still hasn't forgotten. It seems that Anthony is a sentimental and emotional person.
It's like watching nature heal itself
Milk just unlocked a Core memory in me omg
43:00 We, the audience, needed to grow as well. The “Where’s Anthony?” Comments have been little to none these days and we’ve also just grown as adults.  Plus YouTube, the platform, needed to transform into a platform that allowed for you guys to monetize it as well
Food Battle 2023?
This video feels like such a big deal
This feels like Shaq and Kobe 2.0
There’s always a milk fic
they both look gay in different ways
Men realizing they have feelings and love/miss their friends…always beautiful to watch LOL. Anthony is so sweet tearing up :). Ian is definitely more emotionally constipated but through what he expresses, I can see the love.
I watched Smosh 2011-2015. I am 18 now, so I began watching at age 6. Once they started introducing other characters and had a corporatized profit focus I began watching other forms of media. Great to see that they own their creation.
wow
thank you rhett and link lets get =3 back next
This video made me cry. My favorite part of this whole thing is that there's no flashy intro like with other I spent a day withs to introduce the guest, you know who this is, you know why your here, and it's treated with the exact amount of respect it deserves.  Seeing these two talk about their experiences with each other and how their still childhood friends reminds me of my own childhood as I grew up with them, and honestly seeing them come back rekindled more then ever reawoke something inside of me that I thought was dead.  No joke, I was planning on un subbing from Smosh, I really didn't like how the channel was going, and felt like it lost a lot of the heart, then, out of the blue, the day after my 19th birthday, this....and suddenly, I feel 10 yrs old again  I am beyond greatful that these two pioneers of the platform, and major voices in my life have found their footing again, and I'm beyond excited to see what comes next!
i’ve been waiting for this for years and it’s finally here 🤩
Smosh wasn’t just a business to me. Smosh was my childhood 😢
I don’t watch smosh they really fell off ever since Anthony left. The humor just felt like it was more for parents and old heads they were just boring. But now that Anthony’s back that won’t be the case anymore ik they’re gonna kill it. I used to be a piece of shit because I stopped watching them but now I’m not gonna be piece of shit anymore because I’m definitely subscribing now.
this feels like your divorced parents getting back together😭😭😭
I'm glad that they bought smosh cause tbh defy media is just a boss that is bossing everybody around telling them what to do but Ian and Anthony both of them are a leader they dont mind getting idea's from others they care about they're people while still knowing what route they should take
Y E S
1:03:17 that is a really good impression of both Rhett and Link at the same time
Shut Up!
I subscribed to Smosh again. It feels so good knowing I get to continue a story I thought was over. I never thought we'd see Ian on this channel. So happy for everyone involved
Anybody remember the 2  animated show they made
The vlog era 😭
The timeline is healing
Can't wait for food battle 2023
I started consuming Smosh content when I was 17... as a 32yo now who still is consuming Smosh content... I couldn't be more excited for you both and this adventure. I can not wait to seee what your creative brains come up with. Congratulations, this is huge for you as individuals, friends, and even bigger for the fans. Lets fucking GOOOOOOOO.
NOW KISS!
As someone who became fans of Smosh and Anthony after they broke up, I am excited to see this new collab sketch channel between two of my favorite channels 😂 This will be the first YouTube channel I join.
I feel like I've just been wanting to hear this conversation for so long.
does anyone feel like ian isn’t as committed to actually keeping a friendship / reciprocating the same energy with anthony. i don’t blame him they’ve explained their ups and downs but idk i feel like he doesn’t rlly care
they should bring back the old haircuts.
wow. truly amazing
can someone make a compilation of Ian saying "like" in this vid
THESE TWO ARE SOULMATES/TWIN FLAMES ❤💏🥹
The moment we all waited for
Hopefully you guys get so much higher to where you are now and since you said that the sketches will be fully edited, hopefully you are able to use the tools that exist now like AI but not just for the sake of using them but for get a better results and quality that you guys really deserve to be able to bring in what you love. God I feel so happy for you two
Wow, this conversation was much more open and vulnerable than I think any of us expected. It was awesome. Also I am honored to’ve played a tiny role Inadvertently rekindling the OG Smosh Flame. Massive congrats you two!! Can't wait to see what antics you get up to! -Dianna
So happy for you guys! Congrats and good luck with everything
11:38 😂😂😂
It feels so wierd finally seeing these two together. All those who were there when they started are either their age or in college now (like me) and its so nostaglic to go back and think about possibly getting more of what used to be but more recent and possibly a little different in terms of quality and new jokes.  I'm excited to see what they make now!
lets make smosh the number 1 channel again!!!
This makes my heart so happy ❤
51:30 Anthony's laugh is so genuine here ❤ his mood changes here
Great to see two of my childhood heroes getting back together. I'd also like to say I'm not ashamed of liking the smosh movie.  Edit:i now understand the comments about Rhett and Link, so just wanted to say thanks to them as well for keeping the dream alive. Been watching them for years too.
Bring back smosh libs 😂🙌
I'M SO HAPPY 😭✨️💗
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
These guys have great chemistry. They should start a channel and make content together!
Found smosh at age 7. Dont regret it. Definitely shaped some of my humor
PLEASE bring back the shutup intro!!!
Milk fanfiction 🗿
i didn't realize this was smosh in the same room interviewing each other at first lmao
The world is healing :,)
How did I almost cry like 4 times during this?? Friendship always wins. ❤️
Smosh have been pure trash for so long.. anthony coming back will not make it good again its a lost cause
❤ yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Let’s get it boys!  So happy and excited!
Anthony in a very vulnerable moment:  "we didn't express emotion in a long time so that's good"  Ian: "I still won't!" 😐  I laughed so much 😂
my only ever question is will you still utilize the cast that was built on smosh, and will you guys still make appearances on smosh james and smosh pid
Smosh is back?? holy shit.. thats like the best thing ive been waiting all this time
1:07:17 i got chills here, fate really works in interesting ways
Smosh.... again?!?!?!!?!
Yesss. My friend showed me your channel back in 2006 and your food battles were my intro to your channel. Such good memories!
To whoever will see this comment… I wholeheartedly believe that smosh is the reason I am who I am. I started watching when I was 6-7, I’m now a sophomore in high school. From the legend of Zelda rap, to the Magic Keyboard, to food battle, smosh and it’s humor is the reason I know who I am and how I feel. Thank you Ian and Anthony for bringing this back 😊, it truly means the world.
Seeing Ian and Anthonys individual journeys of holding on and letting go all leading up to this beautiful moment is poetic. It was all necessary for the bigger picture.
Im crying 😢 i love old smosh so much, i hope cool videos will come ✌🏼
Man i used to watch all of the food battles in order at least once a month i was raised with smosh and youtube basically
“We’re getting the band back together!”🟩🔶🎶🎶🎶
YOU GUYS WERE THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY TEENAGE YEARS
So happy to see these two together again and I am so exicted for the future of smosh
Bring back lunch time with smosh
I'm crying so hard right now I love you guys so much thank you for all your work
Watching Ian is bored change to Smosh is Bored to yall opening fan mail and all those old videos I am so fucking glad that yall have purchased smosh back I miss the old shit. I also missed the goofy ass songs you guys would create. Thank you for being you.  I am 21 now and I remember being a little kid.
The world is healing. My childhood boys are back.
These guys were my childhood, i remember being excited to see a new video after school.
This video was amazing to watch. I love how candidly and openly both of them spoke, and I definitely shed a few tears when Anthony got emotional. I grew up on Smosh, and to see them reunited is absolutely magical. I’m so glad they both went on their own journeys of self discovery and have found their way back together. I am so pumped for this new era! I will watch literally anything these guys produce - whether it’s the best content ever or they do “burn it to the ground”. This was meant to be, and it feels so right! Wishing you both all the love and all the luck on this new chapter!!!
They both look so good here! I’m so happy they are back together and grow together again.
I've been watching Ever since 2013 then quit and came back as a 23 year old and didn't know all of this happened
Awe yay! So happy for you both! What a lovely and candid conversation. Thanks for sharing!
raw and awkward
really really great interview with ian. hes still funny as hell. looking forward to watching new content with the og smosh again
WE ARE SO FUCKING BACK
now every video has (smosh' version) next to it
so happy for you!
I was here
Omg i have never seen these guys ever colab ever!
this is youtube history man.
You guys remind me so much of my brother and I. We grew up with Smosh, and we didn't really rekindle our relationship until recently as well. You two were an inspiration to us and will continue to inspire us. <3
Food battle 2023?!?
Have a great start! Whatever happens, you will handle it ❤
I know this isn't important at all, but their outfits match their hair (respectively not to each other). Just thought that was interesting
Tomorrow's company email is gonna be wild.
I kind of can't believe what I'm seeing but it's a great thing.
Aye
BEST FRIENDS OF ALL TIME
This is truly so raw and amazing. I was an older smosh viewer in the early 2010s and loved their content, even had their merch. I think I watched smosh again at some point after Anthony left, but it's hard to remember now. Seeing them back together is so nostalgic and it's just truly wonderful to see them have this real conversation and discuss all these things that have happened. I hope to have this with all my friendships, ones that continue on or that fade. You may rekindle just like them, it may just take some time. I hope this can happen for me too. Congratulations, big time to owning smosh 🎉🎉🎉
This still doesn't seem real to me. What timeline did I end up in lol???
That laugh at 51 min tho
It almost sounds like when ya'll were talking about ya'lls creative process like Anthony is the hyper focused filter and Ian is like a way better ChatGPT and when ya both come together ya create gold. That's so cool I'm excited to watch again!! Even if it's a bit different I'm sure it's going to be great. Cheers and good luck!
Considering they're back I'm imagining that they will make a video that it titled like "Where has been Anthony these past few years?" and I'm imagining in that video Anthony just randomly got a kid with Ian's mom cause you know back in the old smosh I remember there was this joke about Anthony and Ian's mom having this romantic relationship and because of it Ian is like "what the f*ck mom, you had sex with my best friend" and he got pissed and both Ian and Anthony get into a cat fight.
This is what we needed
The Pokemon Theme Song video you guys did was the first video I've ever seen on Youtube, and is what brought me to Youtube in the first place.  Smosh will always be a a HUGE part of my childhood and played a big part in introducing me to the internet in general.    I'm so happy you guys finally own the channel that started everything.  Can't wait to see what you guys continue to do moving forward!
Food battle when?
i remember sitting next to my dad, smosh on my little screen at the ripe age of i don’t know, 7 ? and he looks over at my device and sees ian humping an anime cardboard cutout😭😭 i was so clueless
Y does ian look like 70s father whilst anthony looks like emo hearthrob?
I deadass cried while watching this,  especially since I was having a crap day at work. To see my childhood heros back together again really made my day man, I loved smosh then and I still do to this day YEARS later. CONGRATULATIONS GUYS! I LOVE SMOSH!!! ❤️❤️😃😃
BOXMAN 2024
the response after 41:55 LMFAOOOO deadpan "i still won't" REAL ASF
are they finally going to conclude food battle?
Would be awesome to bring smosh back with memberships. You should do regular livestreams, though, so people can gift memberships to people who may not be able to buy them.
Didn't think Rhett and Link could be more support of others and overall amazing people, but they did it, props
Love seeing y’all together and finding out y’all worked things out. Y’all are awesome! God bless
Silly Anthony, haven’t you already spent *many* days with Ian in the past?  Happy to see a happy ending for smosh.
A happy reunion
😭
This hurts to see I miss them
As an OG smosh fan, and current Anthony fan, I AM SO EXCITED.
HOLY SHIT
i've been following you guys since the very begining... i remember to this day trying to pause the mortal kombat video to get that frame with the butt shot with my friends and laughing our asses off.... you guys were a big part of my life and i'm really happy to see everything is in the right place again! i hope you guys are happy too, and i hope great things come your wayt!
THIS IS AMAZING IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS AHH
I never thought I'd see the day, but I'm glad I did.
IT FINALLY HAPPENED
I have been a fan of Smosh for well over a decade, I have missed the chemistry between the two of you and I have missed seeing you both so happy - the gigglefests in both this video and TNTL were so refreshing and adorable. Please know that the entire fanbase is 1000% behind you (and I will financially support y'all when I stop being unemployed!!!)
It's so rare to see friendships that have fallen apart to talk so openly and vulnerably to each other. This was so healing.
Why do they both look like pimps
It’s crazy to finally have all the background stuff behind smosh be explained by the creators. It is always insane to have two best friends fall apart from one another and have them just talk about what tf happened to their friendship… I’ve been through it it is cringe but the rough patch will disappear and happiness will follow
Food Battle 2023 WHEN????????
FANFICS !!!!!!!
Now interview Ian's mom
i’m abt to cry smosh was my childhood 😢 my world is healing
Major shout-out to Rhett and Link for seeing past the business side of things and just being excited about Anthony coming back. What studs.
43:23 No more “hot one” and “funny one” It’s now the hot and funny one and the other hot and funny one.
LESGOO
9:28 I was one of those kids
What shoes is Ian wearing?👀👀
This is a more important reunion to me than when my parents got back together
love seeing this <3
SMOSH: The Movie Was Amazing!
I feel like my childhood has returned
Interesting corollary to one piece of this. During Starcraft 1's heyday, Nick "Tasteless" Plott, and Sean "Day9" Plott were both huge commentators in the scene. Both were casters for numerous tournaments. And they never once, I believe, ever casted together. Refused to. And they are per both of their accounts, very close, loving brothers. But it was so critical to both that they keep their distance and develop their own brand and identity, they never could allow themselves to be "The Plott Brothers". So I understand Anthony needing to create a complete break and separation from Smosh if he ever had any hope of developing his own identity.
Ok
Never I’m my wildest dreams would I expect Anthony and Ian being able to acquire Smosh and make it their own again! This is beyond exciting, it’s ethereal!
I didn’t grow up with smosh but I can tell this is heartfelt but it also feels like a therapy session
Love it.. SMOSH IS BACK!!
"There's nobody I'd rather burn down Smosh with than you."  I need this on their newest official Smosh merch ASAP.
I am so happy
spend a day with jschlatt
Seeing you together again is so heartwarming I can’t stop smiling
Resubscribing to Smosh is the best decision I've ever had to make. I'm excited for you two to grow your friendship back again!! I appreciate you both!
Your still going to do more of the "If movies were real" series right?
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉
"People pissing on the president's table" ...Keith <3
who’s guinea pig was that when you guys done that little series with Charlie I’m pretty sure  his name was
Food Battle 2023
NOT THE MILK FIC MENTION AT THE END💀
Tell me why I manifested this in my head like 1 week ago, wtf?! 😭
FRIENDSHIP ALWAYS WINS!
The story of how 2 duos of yt save Smosh. Special thanks to Rhett & Link.
It's like Steve and Tony making up halfway through Endgame 🥲🥲🥲🥲
This reminds me of the creators of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles all of a sudden. 💀   Both of them started it as a joke, passed off ideas to each other. They had a falling out. One had to manage the business. Then after spending years apart, they came back rejuvenated to make The Last Ronin comic together.
I’m not crying- you’re crying
it's interesting cuz i feel like you can also name this video "i spent a day with Anthony Padilla" or maybe just "i spent a day with Smosh" anyways i hope they remain their friendship even if things didn't work out
The hero we needed, the hero we got
Welp, time to resuscribe!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Alr thats all cool and all but food battle 2023 when?
I feel like i was just transported back into the 2010's
0:34 That's so sweet. I miss Anthony, he's a good man. Same Ian. Love guys. Love u Ian and Anthony.  1:10:45 WT fuck, man!? LOL
so happy that they're friends again :)
can we bring back the original intro please
Never could have predicted this happening today. I had a really tough night last night, so seeing all this happening today has been a wonderful mood lifter. Back in 2011 or so, I sent in a letter that was opened on Mail Time with Smosh, and I thought I’d hit the big time. I was 11, and I’m 23 now. I’ve grown, and so have Ian and Anthony, both as Smosh and separately. I can only imagine that Smosh’s future will be all the better for them finding their own paths and then consciously making the decision to reunite.
Wow this whole video was wholesome AF. It’s cool to see two dudes and close friends communicating like this. Very cool news. Congrats’
🎉🎉
As one of those kids who found you guys and watched you even though I wasn't supposed to, I cannot stress enough how happy my inner child is.
best episode of i spent a day with i’ve ever watched
Bruh, seeing u two together again feels like a childhood dream come true. I will support you two along the way!!
Proud for you both!
As long as you bring back Stevie I’m all for it
Anthony’s the classic creative founder and Ian the more calculated/business savvy. Both of their perspectives make sense and isn’t unusual.
Was just watching Dixon Cider the other day
I cannot express how emotional I am right now. I started watching smosh at 11 even though I did not understand a single word in English. I did insisted on watching it and, after two years, I was fluent! you (and Pewdiepie later on) were my best company during my teen's.  It's kinda crazy to know that you two were having a really hard time together, and listening to this conversation felt like a therapy for not only both of you, but also for the fans. I can't even express how refreshing it felt to hear how you two became friends again and decided to buy smosh back.  It was like something inside of me was complete again. I love you guys and I'll always will❤ thank you so much for everything and I can't wait to see the new Smosh!! Love from Brazil ❤
Ian far looks a lot more happy already
Honestly this is so cool! I’m excited to see this new era of Smosh! I wonder if we’ll get a cast reaction video when they learn anything is coming back and they bought Smosh!
The fact that this is an hour long is lovely
Yall are back and cute asf
THE COLLABORATION WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR, AND THE NEWS WE'VE BEEN DREAMING OF 🥹🫶
"It had to happen"  Or as the kids nowadays would say.  "It was a canon event"
This was an incredible episode to watch. Seeing everything come back together like this has been a rollercoaster since I grew up on Smosh and then grew to enjoy Anthony's videos on its own. Crazy how life is
Two bros chilling in an interview 5 feet apart cuz they're not gay
I LOVE YOU GUYSSSSSS
I'm SO hyped that Smosh is back again, hell yeah
The two legends, back together. :)
This is insane
As a kid you never get a sense of anything remotely to do with this side of the business and it's certainly something to see you guys talk about it so candidly. Looking forward to the new, older, freer, business you guys will embark on
This is the best thing that could've ever happened. Nature is healing
listen why did you have to zoom in on anthony's face as tears welled up THAT WAS TOO PERSONAL i felt like i shouldn't have been watching hdsfkljhkdfh expecially w the laughing through it GOD too real
I’m crying I’m so happy about this❤
They should be so proud of themselves. The amount of growth that they've gone through from their friendship to it ending and then back again is amazing.  The arc of these guys is like a real life movie.  I'm looking forward to where this is going.
More accurate title:  I spent my life with Ian Hecox
Que lindo va a ser todo esto. 🎉❤🎉
So wholesome ☺️.
2023 has been a really good year
What
why did this feel therapeutic for me too lmao
I'll never forget in 4th grade how everyone would huddle in the corner every Friday to watch the new Smosh video on an iPod Touch.
WE WANT YOU BACK TO SEE YOU ON SMOSH AGAIN ANTHONY WE MISS YOU
Dude i'm so happy to see you guys together again this is the biggest event of youtube history
This is really hitting me in the feels, its like the smosh anime has been picked up after almost 10 years
I know you're not necessarily "reviving" old Smosh and you guys are gonna make new content. But if I could make one single tiny Itty bitty request.... Bring back food battle? Just that one sketch.
This is like getting another the road to el dorado movie
i used to watch you guys when i was younger. always gave me a laugh. good to see you two reconnecting
Just from an outside perspective, I'm not so sure. Watching this it feels like Ian is still looking at this as a business venture. Running that company and turning it into what it is today is why I love Smosh so much as an adult who loved Smosh as a kid. If Smosh hadn't grown up, I'd hate it today.  Anthony looking to bring back "old smosh" and getting excited about using memberships because old content would get demonetized.... eh... That old content is so cringe today. There's even a great sketch about "old smosh" that was recently put out. It wouldn't even be funny today.  I'm excited to see where this goes, but I work in an industry with high burnout too. I sincerely hope Anthony is able to look at this as a business, take a more mature approach and not go into this thinking things will be the same. Because if they try to make it the same as it was, it will be a disaster. That childlike joy he's showing, and Ian kind of sighing a bit, I feel that so much. It feels like Anthony got hit with a wave of nostalgia and could be setting himself up for an even harder disappointment.
FREAKING FINALLYYY SMOSH IS BAAAACCCCKKKK IM SO FKN EXCITEEEEDDD
Woah I clicked this thumbnail fast.
I was like "oh id love to see ian interviewed! Oh... OH!
this almost makes me want to cry
I'm 18 now so i never really watched old smosh, but i know from new smosh that Anthony went out for milk and never came back so im glad he's back
Rhett and Link are the official internet dad's that's a level of generosity you'd usually only experience from a parent
you should "spend days" with other Poketubers besides Jaiden
This feels like eavesdropping on a therapy session. Major respect for the healthy communication happening here.  (For real though, it's so cool to see them together again!)
Congratulations to you both. We've all taken this journey with you in a way. It's really amazing to see this happen. Anthony it's been great seeing your journey. I'm glad you and Ian can have fun together again and if it means more great comedy then I'm all for it. Very touching vid! Thanks bros!
Anthony is a bitch and Ian a souless machine. But no really, it's so bittersweet seeing how the story and the emotions show on each of them, Anthony trying to keep if cool but it coming to the surface and Ian stuttering because he is holding it in not wanting to show, he's less sensitive yes, but it's still there, he just plays it off "better". Although Ian is stiff like that, I hope these two had a moment out of camera where they really hugged and let it go together.
Shout out to Diana, whoever that is.
This is the best thing to happen during pride month 🌈 💖
The low hugs 😂
It's been a decade and I never lost hope. Classic Smosh will forever be an internet-defining time and gold. So excited to see what's in store and happy to welcome family back haha
I agree with the final sentiment at the end. If even it all doesn't go great. Don't let smosh burn to the ground under someone else's ownership. The founders should be the ones to have the final say.... And burn it to the ground lol
I’m happy to see these two legends of YouTube back in the same room together. It warms my heart
SmoshxISMFOF music video perhaps? xD
When YouTube first started I was 12 years old and I’m gonna tell you something right now that I thought even back then, both of y’all were always hot and you both are hilarious ❤ so pumped to hear the boys are back in town! Congratulations on your reconnection guys can’t wait to see what you guys will do now 🥳🎉
I LOVE THIS SO SO MUCH
I really like that you're back in talking terms, but I really wanna say, you guys are definetly inspiring on how you worked your feelings with each other, but you've inpired me and maybe some thousands of people to enter or get back into threapy, I hadn't talked with some friends for about some 7 years, also I'm getting into couples therapy to solve some things, but what I want to say is that this step of you guys story is very, very inspiring, thanks!
when Mark and Tom got back together
Smosh and makemebad35 were the goats of youtube
I think it was either earlier this year or late last year, when Shayne and Courtney were invited to do Hide and Seek with a bunch of content creators. They did film Anthony, and Shayne said I found Anthony"!
This is very cute! Hits me right in the nostalgia!  Tbh I don’t have time to watch this now, but I will later ❤
NOT THE MILK FANFIC!!!! STOP!!
Super cool this happened
"Even if it doesn't do well, I know that this is the right thing and if we burn it to the ground im happy to do that with you"  Ian got me tearing up man. I'm so happy that this is happening and I'm so exited for this new era of Smosh. These two guys have a special place in my heart
O my god!! My childhood ❤❤❤
It's been maybe ten years since I've consistently watched Smosh. I started growing up, and my sensibilities did as well. I checked in every now and then because it was a pretty big part of my childhood, and it felt like the end of an era when Anthony departed from the team. This video is rekindling so many memories from my younger years. I'm so glad these two reconciled. Can't wait to see what they come up with again.
way better love story than twilight
this is excellent Anthony. you and Ian were so professional and honest in this video. It is so refreshing to see the the struggle that you all went through and the emotions that it comes along with it. You really helped remove a filter between you and the audience. It is relatable and sets a great example on how to hold difficult conversations. I have high hopes for you and Ian in the future. Keep up the good work. Your growth as an interviewer os obvious as well!!!
Even if SMOSH wasn’t bought and changed, I am so glad these two have grown and are working on their friendship with one another.
wow, Nice, lets see this video
1:13:08 'tis I, the new generation exposed to that fanfic😃👍        (Did not read, will not read)
So real and raw
Now I'd like to see how the two reconcile the differences in creative vision that drove them apart in the first place. Also, how that reconciliation translates to their videos.  I understand that being a part of Defy was a major factor. But I'm sure there has been some growing apart going on in the last few years they're separated, that extends more than just Defy's influences.  I'm genuinely excited about how this would go.
what an aspiring story to see. made me think about friendships in my life, how two people can cross paths and walk together. just how richer a relationship gets and how much meaning is to be read in the story of a friendship like this. so happy for both of them and so excited to see what they come up with.
This is their canon event
I feel old, and young.
Pink frosted sprinkle donut. If anyone remembers that. You are as old as me
I knew this would happen one day😊
A lot of unspoken "I'm sorry"s and "I love you"s when you translate the straight guy-ese. I said "I knew it" aloud when my kindred spirit Mykie was credited for her work in having this come to fruition. I imagine her smiling in the background and saying "my work here is done", and I'm smiling with her. Brothers sometimes become estranged, and you two are definitely brothers. It's good to know you're back in sync. So many of the beautiful things in the world have been the products of true friendships. So glad you healed and found your way back to each other. In the beginning, you created a space for millions of people to hang out with their wacky, funny friends. Maybe you'll get back to that now that you see what many of your fans always saw between you.
I miss you guys together so much
it’s insane to think that anthony left 6 years ago…you two are defying all odds coming back together and reviving an entire generation
I literally did not feel like waking up today, I had no motivation, but I knew that I had to go to class, and then I saw this notification and I JUMPED! That is the biggest Happy news I got in a while!!! Thank you so much for this!!
While I wasn't able to experience Smosh really early on (subscribing around 2014-2015) it's still crazy how emotional it was to watch this.
Anthony must have his emo hair back!😂
Im so happy and thankful for this happening!! So glad for you two and really look forward to the future of SMOSH!!🎉🎉🎉
I love watching this lil therapy session
This has been the best since pewdipie cinnamontoastken
Love to see it. Been a fan since I was a kid, 25 now. Can't wait to see you guys get back to your roots.
I love that this is happening, but if Anthony's return isn't introduced with a "where's Anthony" joke, Im rioting.
It’s been a while since I saw Anthony and Ian talk. Last time was 2014 when  I was 14 year old. Now I just graduated from college and it feels really different watching these two childhood heroes who I only watched screwing around, are having a mature conversation.
OMFGOOOOOOOOD!
love the shout out to the old fan fic writers lmao we're still watching
When I was 10 years old, a friend of mine introduced me to Smosh. We used to spent hours and hours watching food battle, dubbing the videos, and just enjoying the content. You guys introduced me to The Legend of Zelda, Smash, my sense of humor, and pretty much my childhood. Now im 19, and you have no idea of how happy I am. Thank you Ian. Thank you Anthony. I love you both.
I think Anthony is the image part and Ian is the business part.
it’s shaymien vs ianthony now
Burn it to the ground💕💕💕
BRING BACK MAILTIME WITH SMOSH ✉️✉️📫📫
Food battle pleaseee
what's the milk fanfic?
Im crying along with anthony aaaghgh
I’ll be 29 this September, and I cannot overstate how influential these two were for YouTube and the fucking concept of being an internet celebrity. They were by far and away the true OGs of the internet we know of today. It’s hard to believe I was just an 11 year old dipshit watching the mortal kombat and Pokémon music videos. Hats off to them. This might be the first time in history an entity was saved from the downward spiral of soulless corporations , by the OGs who started it.
im pretty sure you spend more than a day with him lol
can tell that Ian still holds back when he has like negative emotions sometimes and doesn't want to like openly express it but he's learning not to do that, that and he doesn't ig like showing raw emotion on camera which ig makes sense lol (Why do that on stage as as an equivalent right?)  Good ass video.  Anthony you have made a great channel, you found your voice and honestly I literally have never watched smosh content ever, but after years of watching your interviews I might check the new age smosh. See whats happening.  Big ups.
this interview brought tears to my eyes
im sorry but the way ian looks at the camera in the beginning has me dead 😂
this was such an honest and real conversation. thank you for sharing it with us❤️ i’m glad that you both were able to take time away from your friendship, do so much growth and work on yourselves, and now come back together as a result.
I'm still surprised Smosh is reuniting again. Can't wait to see what Ian & Anthony have for us next week.  I've been watching Smosh since June 6, 2013 (10 years) & I'm still surprised I lasted this long....
I’m feeling so many feelings
The latest TNTL episode with Anthony is just the first amazing part of this new era of Smosh. I can’t wait to see what else is coming to the channel
I remember requesting this a while ago. glad that they are becoming friends again.
Rhett and Link are such amazing people. To save smosh like they did, and when the time came, release it back to it's rightful owners, is just awesome. Seeing you guys together again is just awesome.
I dont watch this series that often, but I clicked on this so fast
Bruh I’m shiddin myself
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This feels so much like two childhood friends having a genuine heart to heart about everything they've experienced throughout life, reflecting on their own growth and how far they've come. Because it really is that. This made me so happy and far too emotional, to see the two of you again, hearing you talk about your experiences, see how much you both grew, and even rekindle your friendship. Anthony, Ian, both of you have been such a big part of my teenage years growing up, always making things more positive and even just shaping the way I approached life. Congratulations on getting Smosh back, and thank you for everything you both have done, not just for me but for everyone ❤ :)
Best way to start off a new era
you guys should definitely a boxman reference one day
Y’all were my childhood I was like 10 or less when I found y’all now am going to college
OMFG, IM ACTUALLY losing my shit, this has been begging to happen, much love so excited to watch💜
I am so unbelievably excited to see where Smosh goes. I’ve never stopped loving Smosh through all its different eras, and it’s so cool to see it come right back around to this. Congratulations on such a huge move! ❤❤❤
is food battle back???
while i'm stoked for them and can't wait for what they have in store for the main channel, i hope they fully appreciate how talented the smosh cast is.
I feel so happy about all of this
This is a really cool conversation. I’m glad you guys talked about how your friendship or lack thereof at points. For whatever is it worth I’m so happy you guys are back!
Oh my god, the last night before my final exam and last day before graduation, Smosh reunites?!?!😯😯🥳🥳
OMG you guys 😭
Hooray to all of this!
I cried.
Props to Rhett and Link man. They were so happy to just sell the channel back to Ian and Anthony purely for the sake of their creativity and what they could do together.
Bring back lunchtime with smosh :)))))
lunchtime with smosh when?
Im so happy that ian and anthony are back together!! Ive missed smosh
Poopy fart
I can die happy lol this is amazing
POV your dads go to post divorce therapy 😂
.... I really don't want to look up the milk fanfic.
I had the biggest smile on my face when i saw what was posted
my inner child is so happy rn
og fan , first vid i saw was the lipsink , fav is food battle. which i really missssss
I knew this would happen eventually. It was just when will it happen.
IM SO HAPPY FOR THEM
I'm really happy for this video. As someone who grew up with Smosh, I was bummed when you left, and knew on a surface level why.   But I'm glad you and Ian talked about that, your relationship, and so much more in this video. It does a lot, but it especially provides closure and understanding for all the old fans.
41:45 MY FUCKING HEART
i loved the mythical era of smosh, but im also happy to see the 2 OGs take control again
YOOO???
I want a David fincher movie on the history of Smosh now
The world is healing again... 🥺❤️
1:10:19 i've been waiting for this kind of shits you piece of shits
Im so happy yall r back frfr like im screaming frfr i love yall sm<33
The collab everyone was waiting for...
I'm not crying, you're crying (ToT) <3
You really Defied the odds
This video is great I didn’t skim through one bit. That’s how inspirational it was.
I’m glad you got each other’s childhood best friend back. Not many people have that opportunity in life.
I’m smiling like a damn idiot right now!
PART TIMERS SEASON 3 PLEASE 😂
OMG IM SO HERE FOR IT 😭😭😭😭
Man we covered a lot of stuff I didn't expect
Was almost in tears when I heard you two are getting back together, grew up on Smosh and seeing you two working together again and being friends brings me back to my childhood
FINALLY
You gotta be kidding me! It takes Anthony to come back to Smosh to do this Collab here? Well, it seems like Anthony really took it hard when he left in 2017
AHHHHHHH
Bro lunch time with smosh was always amusing to watch. Wonder if we can ever get one last episode
Aw shit, here we go again.
WE ARE SO BACK!!!
my childhood is screaming so loud right now
:00
I hope to have what Ian and Anthony have one day 🥹 a friendship that lasts that long and ensures so many challenges is so special to witness 💞 I’m so happy for them and can’t wait to see the magic come back
It's crazy to see how different your aesthetics are now from each other, I remember when you both had the emo cuts and just wore graphic tees.
So happy you guys could take smosh back. Smosh is nothing without you guys
oh my god they got back together
This really opened my eyes to how difficult it all must’ve been for them both. Happy to see where they are now!
First Guava Juice and Alex Wassabi is back and now Smosh?! this gonna be a great year.
Don't really know Anthony as deep as other fans, but seeing them together again, I will contest that Smosh's "Other Dad" is back... It should be Smosh's MOM is back 😂😂😂
I am so happy for this!
This was such a heartfelt reunion, omg! I appreciate you both and all that you have done over the years. I know that this will be an amazing new chapter for all to witness. However, I'd be remiss if I didn't speak out on this: Rhett and Link, you guys are the goat. Literally, the fate of Smosh could not have sat in better hands. You genuinely care about the concept and potential of Smosh. You are the guardian angels of Smosh. You saved it, because in anyone else's hands, Smosh would have been behind prison bars until a price came around that looked good. Thank you, Rhett and Link.  Ian and Anthony, welcome home. You won the war after all these years. I'm sure we all feel the same way: we could not be happier for the both of you! Congratulations!
I wasn't expecting the video to feel so real. I had the feeling their friendship was deteriorating, but not to that point. It just makes it feel even more magical how it all ended up with them owning the channel again. This is truly the best timeline.  Ian saying that, even if this endeavor fails, he would be happy to do it with Anthony is such a cool mentality to have: nothing can ruin this event, even a complete failure.
YOOOO
Two bros, sitting 5ft apart cause they’re in a therapy session (my heart is so happy seeing these guys happy and back together)
WE HAVE DONE IT CHADS
I’ve loved Smosh since I was very little.  I loved old and I loved new in different ways.  This makes me so happy to see you guys have what you had back and fully in your control❤
FINALLY
I have to say i'm pretty excited about all of this!!!!!!! i'm 31 and I grew up watching smosh videos! So happy that they are doing this
I've watched Smosh since like 2007 or 2008. This is the best ending. After all of the shit storm that happened with defy media going under and Rhett and Link basically being almost an angel investor swooping in at the last minute, I never thought this day would come but I am here and I am excited. And I'm so glad for Ian and Anthony.
I hope to god you get a adult swim show
Danm I had a similar experience with a close friend of mine just like these two. Feels surreal
Ian saying the main channel didn't feel like it had an identity for a long time I think resonates with a lot of people who became fans around the time Anthony left, such as myself. When I started watching smosh I pretty much exclusively watched the pit channel. The content there was more my style and the identity of the channel was more solid, and as the years went it only got better as shows and segments were created and became regular things, i.e. tntl, eioyi, stan vs. the internet, who meme'd it. That content felt like the core of the smosh brand, the bits people remembered most and the best memes came from there, whereas games and the main channel were more nebulous. it wasn't until just this past year with ex interviews, lets do this, and the reunion series that I actually started watching the main channel ( and i hope these wont be gone gone, just move them to pit!). Now with Anthony back and him and Ian seeming to have a clear idea of what they want to do with the channel I hope that question mark clears up for them and continues to build the brand without disrupting the flow that's been built over the last few years. Post-defy smosh has consistently put out some of the best content on youtube and they're one of the few channels that I not only watch consistently but look forward to their uploads. Wishing them the best and hopefully this moves the channel in a new (old?) direction. <3
Watching this felt so healing to listen to. This really was like a therapy session. I've been making  videos with my twin sister for 10 years now & this made me feel so seen. We've struggled with a lot of similar things as you guys have, growing up while maintaining a YouTube channel is tough. I applaud you guys for being able to be vulnerable with each other on such a public platform. We grew up watching smosh and are so excited to see what you create. ❤💙
I can’t believe how real this is. I feel uncomfortable watching this almost… like I’m intruding in a therapy session.  I can finally get closure of why Anthony left.
"Even if this doesn't do well I know that this is the right thing and if we burn it to the ground I'm happy to do that with you" - Ian Hecox  Damn tears got out by hearing that
I stopped watching Smosh before Anthony left because it felt like they were bringing in and replacing too many people at once. When I heard that Anthony left, i was initially shocked, but not surprised because Smosh didn't feel like Smosh anymore.
I loved seeing the smosh movie and ghostmates i miss those times but im happy that smosh is coming back and together
THEYVE BEEN REUNITED
Ian I doubt you'll read this but your shoes fuckin own bro
This is so sick
30:10 “people i think were pissing on the president’s table” “literally?” “-i took a piss on his desk” god did i miss these guys. i can’t wait to see what they do next, and even if it’s nothing, i’m just glad they’re doing it together
I remember all the old videos omg! They were all so influential* to my childhood and literally shaped me as a person. Ill NEVER forget oishi high school battle and lunchtime w smosh. Yall are so powerful in ways u cant even imagine. Thank u guys for keeping my childhood alive, so glad ur back❤️
I was DYING to see THIS video!
my childhood has been restored
Bro the title should be smosh interviews smosh
Such an iconic interview. I could cry. Love you guys
Personally I prefer Smosh after Rhet and Link took over, never really vibed with Smosh pre-defy BUT I'm so happy for this to happen, Ian and Anthony are pioneers for this medium and it's just right having them back together again.
I can only hope that both of you come to terms of the things that has happened and I hope you will both grow individually together. Anthony, you’re doing great with your emotions and thank you for being vulnerable with them. Ian, you’ve been a great pillar to many things bts, but I hope you get time for yourself and learn how to feel again.
Man I miss Ian's mom
wtf this is awesome
The collaboration my inner child NEEDED  I grew up watching you guys religiously when I was super young and now is a 24 year old I love seeing this conversation more than I would’ve of some stupid apology video or “we’re not making videos anymore togethe” type of shit I love this
Boxman till this day is still a bop. I still listen to it on youtube and spotify. Dixoncider aswell 🙌
2023 is actually starting to look up, extremely happy and excited for you both! I can’t wait to see all the new wonderful adventures you guys go on ❤
best possible beginning/ending
TEARS IN MY EYES 3 TIMES TODAY!!  Edit: I am fully bawling now hearing Anthony's perspective on their reconnecting.
BOO YEAH BABY!!!
Is it possible that food battle could come back
Is food battle returning👀
HO LY CRAP. This is a mega jump to the past and also amazing to see Ian, you guys together and hearing about the up-and-down journeys and what's going on now. Super cool, I almost can't believe this is now and my eyes are melting from this blinding sight of our founding fathers.
What a special episode thanks you guys.
Everyone is coming back, first SpicyFruit (wassabi productions) and now Smosh. I can now live happily.
Please bring back lunchtime with smosh !
Can't believe I only had to kill Ian and Anthony's significant others to make this happen!
Like how personal they got, gives everything a new perspective
Ghetto smosh
I first watch Smosh when i was in junior high, now I have a fulltime job
The original Rett and Link
I’ve been thinking about this video as a funny idea for an April fools video but seeing it actually happened is astonishing
This is an emotional rollercoaster of a video
They're not on the same page emotionally still. Ian still can't just say how much he missed and loves Anthony. Or how much he meant to him. It's sad.
Y'all made me cry. Also, ya fuckin' took long enough! Glad to see you guys back together and if you DO burn it to the ground, we'll be there. It's been a ride.
My. Guys.
I cried 😭 love them so much, I even resonate so much about the struggles of friendship and hardships of growing and finding one self through the years and that precious feeling of re-connection ❤❤
Did I see this coming? Nope. Am I stoked? Absolutely.
Anthony, you look super happy in this video. Congratulations, you two!🎉
This video adressed all the things i was concerned about with this happeing
I guess Brandon Rogers will have to get back in line for Anthony’s best friend.
My childhood 😭😭😭😭
I loved these interviews, but THIS is by far my absolute favorite. It's like two old friends getting together just to chat about the golden days. I hope for nothing but success to both channels. 😁
I feel like the icing on the cake of all this would be to see them and the core smosh games members (Joven, Sohinki, Lasercorn, and Mari) reuniting
smoshhhh los quiero!
revive stevie
I was a huge fan of the previous Smosh era, and then became a fan of the current content from Anthony interviewing and Ian with the new Smosh cast (especially Jackie and Arasha) , and now I'm looking forward to what the future brings for everyone
I wonder what the OG crew thought about Anthony leaving at the time?
I wonder if ian is into mac miller...
As someone who’s been around since the Pokémon video, this is something I never thought would happen. So much so that I didn’t even dare dream of it. But when I opened up YouTube today and saw that announcement video pop up… truly words cannot express how shocked and thrilled I was. Much love to u both!!!
This is absolutely amazing, I was there from the start and so glad to see you two back together. I think sort of in the same vein as old major influences of the internet like you two,  Neil Cicierega would be a wonderful conversation, from inventing the flash genre of animutation to ultimate showdown to potter puppet pals to his more recent mashup albums he's been like a major internet character from the start almost.
"most of our absurdist type humor appealed to kids because they in a sense 'got it'?" *me as a kid being clickbaited by the thirst trap thumbnails
i cried while watching the video, it just lifted my spirits for the whole week. i can’t wait for the video :D  i really hope they use the old intro or a new one and if neither that’s okay i just wanna smile
I'm so happy to see the bois back together
I feel for Anthony cus I would've done the same thing.  He was trying to prove that he can build something from the ground up without the help of Smosh  He was right! This channel is huge now  i also feel for Ian though, because that can easily be misinterpreted as a personal attack to their friendship lol
The honesty and understanding of this interview is so refreshing
I've cried like 10 separate times over this today. So many fucking emotions. So glad this is happening! I started watching Smosh in elementary school and now I'm 27. Can't believe I'm seeing this really happen.
This was so honest and raw, thanks for being so open. It felt like a conversation between two friends and a camera just happened to be there. Thanks for all the memories! Can’t wait to see what you guys can make together now this many years since you both had full control of everything.
Anthony leaving Smosh was a canon event that had to happen for the two of them to own their channel again.
Now that you've spent a day with Ian, spend a day with the other cast. (I wanna see Shayne)
The boys are back❤
The popular short skit channels nowadays are just old smosh but worse.
OH Dianna IS Dianna from Physics Girl! Hoping she gets better soon!
What… 🥲
Dam I thought this was food battle 2023 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤ y’all made my preteen to adulthood so fun I still go back and watch the og videos ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can’t wait to see the sketch. I miss you guys so much 😊
These dudes are the Drake & Josh of YouTube.
This is so lovely to watch 😢
NO FUCKING WAY
Glad you 2 are friends again. You both were my childgood and im now heading into my late 20s. Im closer to 30 and It was around 2008-2010 when i started watching you.
you have no idea how much this means to me. ily guys
My dreams have finally come true
This is very therapeutic
All because of Diana...
Damn the chemistry these guys have youd almost think they’ve known each other for years
Yin and Yang in balance again ❤
There really is so much beauty in maturity.
The easybake oven is still their greatest sketch
Honestly, this time around it’s almost like Anthony is being interviewed as well. Very poetic. Happy to see Smosh finally back together again
This makes me so happy I love you guys ❤
I cried..... the comedic timing at the end...... It brought back so many memories.......... I thought I would never see that magic again, no one does it like you guys, no one.
SHUT UP!!!
I am so happy you guys have reconnected not just bringing you two together for smosh again but just for the friendship you guys had. I have been an OG watcher and even sent you guys mail that you opened on your old channel which was incredible to see! Was devastated when Anthony left but always kept supporting and watching and I do love where Smosh is at now and I can't wait to see where you guys go. Without or with owning Smosh again I am just happy you guys were able to mend your friendship and that Smosh did survive through it all. Cant wait to see whats next
i honestly never saw this happening but im so hyped. you guys were my and alot of other peoples childhoods.
im so excited for food battles
This gave so much clarity to things I thought or theorized about on the “behind the scenes” of Anthony and Ian
This gives me hope, smosh coming back is the turning point of the internet for me. So good to see something awesome like this come back.
Smosh movie 2 when?
I started watching smosh around 2009~2012, rediscovered them in 2019 and have been watching religiously ever since. I have loved og smosh and modern smosh so seeing Ianthony reconnect again and making the decision to take back ownership of the thing that they have built 18 years ago is so heartwarming to watch. Ian has been teasing about news in June that was supposed to be mind blowing but I did not think it would be THIS. I was thinking maybe they're bringing back Smosh Summer Games but maybe not because they teased it on the main channel. Maybe it's a new series to replace LDT. Never did I expect Anthony would come back to Smosh because he's doing great doing his own thing. Hearing about them reconnecting and getting back into the groove of things makes me so happy for them. They have grown and healed from the experience and are ready to take the reigns again. I'm so excited to see what this new era has in store for us. 💛 (I'm still in shock you guys)
I would watch 10 hrs of just this 😂
I was probably spending my summer break watching Smosh this exact time 10 years ago
Its really beautiful to see how naturally Ian and Anthony have fallen back into sync, despite not working together for so long. They are platonic creative soulmates. :)
it's so interesting hearing both of their viewpoints on the whole timeline and really feeling like neither is in the wrong, they just grew to want separate things and were bad at communicating that with each other lol
IM CRYING.SOBBING. SCREAMING. We finally get closure!!!!!!! And not only that, our DADS are back together again <3 <3 <3
Now time to get the OG smosh games crew back!!!
This was phenomenal to listen to and made me think of my own best friend of almost 20 years. I was always the more outwardly emotional one, she always kept things inside. Yet we had the same sense of humor from day one and loved each other. We've grown so much since being kids and realizing we approached the same things differently and started communicating more. This was like a visual example of that dynamic.
ABC SACRAMENTO NEWS 10! BESTIES I COULD HAVE WATCHED THIS WHEN I WAS 3!
this is incredible. I love smosh.
Can I just say smosh is the only channel I can see being able to pull off an SNL style show utilizing relevant internet personalities. it could be once a month and live on the channel. Going live you could have donations, members only chats and even polls to have the audience interact with the sketches or something. idk just food for thought.
Ive been waiting for this episode for so long
i got in trouble as a kid for singing the smosh 12 days of christmas song with my cousin and sister 😂 we loved you! i will always remember the old vids. thanks for this
Anthony and Ian were the duo YouTubers that helped me deal with the peak of my depression back in 2014. I was very sad when they went their separate ways. Now that they'll be working together again, I'm very happy. Looking forward to their level-up adult comedy.
I love how Anthony it actually speaking from the heart with someone he’s known for so long
Two boomers getting therapy
Akhirnya kembali reuni lagi kayak dulu.
FINALLY
Dads?
I spent a day with Patrick Neluam | And translate it this video, too plz
The return of the kings
Wow, This is Huge!
😮 I was not expecting this.  Now all Anthony has to do is dress a little less depressing for his show 😂
I'm so excited!!!!
Oh my god
Yesyesyes!!!!!!!
I've been waiting for this SO LONGGGGG
The day has come!
Im so happy to see a smosh renaissance. I loved watching back in the day!
i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
I respect Ian for acting cool as a cucumber, but I adore Anthony for letting all the happy tears come out.
Thank you
kings
My childhood is alive once again. Thank you guys for coming back together and build your friendship back up, being an adult is hard and keeping adult friendships are hard but totally worth it!
This is legendary 😮
goooooood
Oh my God. You two were my entire childhood. I've been waiting for this video for a while now. I'm so happy it's finally here
queeeee nasheeeeeeeeeee
Congrats to both, this is clearly the beginning of a new era for Smosh and for you too
anthony leaving was a canon event
“if we burn it to the ground im happy to do that with you” STOOOPPPP IANNN
It’s wild to think that just two days ago I thought of how perfect an interview with Ian would be but never imagined that his would be the reason it occurred👏🏻👏🏻
Sad to hear i was correct back in the day with saying y'all were never friends
Ooommggg !!!❤ lol im sorry I love the original smosh 😂 I watched them like crazy when I was younger
I missed this
I know my experience is a different kind of relationship, but I totally understand how it feels to have to walk away from a close bond with someone and later on reconnect. There was a point my dad and I cut off all contact and I was so pissed and upset at him for a while, but as time went on I kind of started to realize that though some of the issues were his fault, some were mine too. We reconnected quite recently and the first time we met I brought my partner along as a mediator if need be and he said it was like someone had hit unpause on a movie with the way we connected like time hadn't passed. I'm greatful we cut off contact when we did but I'm also glad we're in each other's lives again and I'm so thanfkul that ya'll get to experience it too with your friendship. I'm excited to see what is to come, even if it just burns down, but at least it'll be together and not separate like I thought it would years ago when Anthony left. I hope the new content will bring me just as much joy as it did when I was a teen, now turning 25 next year.
1:03:40 This really just shows how nice Rhett and Link are, and how caring everyone is this space is for eachother Such a wholesome moment :)
Yes
Doctor Strange: I went forward in time to view 14,000,605 alternate futures.  Ian and Anthony: how many do we bring back smosh?  Doctor Strange: 1
as a 23 yo currently, these 2 guys where a big part of my childhood
I love you guys
Tt
Wow. 16 year old me in 2013 was in love with Ian hecox and now 26 year old me has to fall in love with him again???? 10 years later??? Bruh this was not on my 2023 bingo card. Time really is cyclical
I'm so excited to see what the future holds for these two
I only realized halfway through the video that they weren't joking about buying smosh
SHUT UP!!!
is it just me or does anthony have a different energy around ian lol, idk if it's just cuz they've been entertainers together for so long that when they get together they naturally get a little more energetic and gooofy
I think it's been made very clear that the corporatist agenda took over the channel to promote the transgendism agenda and whatnot, which now pervades society due to the wicked one's goal to corrupt our oneness in God through Christ Jesus. If You are reading this, by thee Grace and Glory of the Almighty One, may You please repent and accept thee Truth of Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, before it's too late to be caught up in the clouds with Him. Amen.
There's nothing that could have ignited that inner child in me more than this. I've been in disbelief since I've heard the news, and this interview was more heartwarming than I could have imagined. Just--- WOW. It's hard to imagine that this is real. I can't begin to understand how y'all must be feeling
Food Battle 2023!!!!
I was just thinking about how cool one of these would be, now that you two own smosh together again
LETS GOOO
Wow man.
this is like when blink 182 got back together... the first time.
The good ending is now cannon
damn… I got more emotional than I thought… I still rmb going home everyday from school, watching smosh videos again and again, thats my routine for a long time…You guys are my childhood, I’m so happy you guys are back tgt❤ friendship always wins!!!!❤
Ian's Mom: Ian, you should spend a day with someone🤨 Ian: *Spends a day with Anthony*
Smosh has been my entire childhood growing up. Growing up having to see how smosh evolved was awesome. When Anthony left smosh i knew it wasnt going to be the same. Anthony gained his platform and identity and Smosh had a crew making hilarious snl type sketches. Im 29 now. I cant wait to see the chemistry rekindle and become what you guys know what Smosh should be. ❤
NOT THE MILK FIC REFERENCE😭
WE BACK BABY LET'S GOOOOOO
3:32 The dislike button need to come back. And I wish videos still had the like to dislike ratio. It should still show the video's rating before you go onto it... It should still be a thing.
Two boys making videos🥲
Naruto and Sasuke moment
Why is this not on trending
I understand the feelings of friends drifting apart and finding eachother again and understanding your best friend is the same from when you guys first were friends that’s a lot of character growth and I totally relate to this 🥹☺️
Bro, this is an hour and 13 minutes long. I’m gonna listen to this while I work out later.😂
Enjoy how honest this is, these dudes were pure comedy growing up
anthony would be an incredible therapist
Omgoodness, what a journey for both of you. I just wanna share that your vids helped me while I was in a depression. I had isolated myself but still needed to feel some connection to others. The Smosh game’s horror series made me laugh so much and feel like I was overlooking friends playing games. I’m so excited for your new stuff cuz you both have evolved comedically and are incredibly creative.🍻Cheers to SMOSH!🥹♥️♥️♥️
I'm beyond excited for this holy shit. You guys were my childhood and I'm really excited to hear y'all have found your friendship again and are writing for yourselves and to make each other laugh. That's kinda how It's always sunny started.
did anyone count how many times Ian said "like"? I'm guessing it's around 200 no joke
I was addicted to Smosh 😭 I never would’ve imagined this video when I was 13 lol
HOLY FUXKING SHIT!
As much as I'm happy for the return of Smosh, we as the audience need to realize that we shouldn't encourage these two to appeal to us anymore. It's clear that they're doing this for themselves (or at least I hope so), and most of us need to brace ourselves for the major changes that will happen to the Smosh channel, from the writing to the editing to even the internal organizational structure.  They'll regain a lot of their old audience, but they may also lose a lot of their new ones too. It's not a sad thing though, I trust in their judgement that they have seriously considered the repurcussions of this new-found partnership.  To new beginnings, Anthony and Ian 🍾
the most heartwarming video and u end it with the fucking milk fic
YIPPEEEEEEEEE I LOVE IAN AND ANTHONY
I KNEW THAT THIS DAY WOULD COME
You used to spend years with him lol
it was beautiful hearing the story of two friends losing and finding each other again. Can't wait to see what comes next and i'm just so glad you guys are having fun again!
Yay! I'm so happy for you guys can't wait to see all you create .  Yeah we all were waiting for this guys , love this!   Bff goals ❤️👏👏👏👏👏
I started watching smosh when I was five years old and knowing that Ian and Anthony have smosh back is some of the best news i could of hoped for I’ll be twenty soon and it’s just crazy that they have smosh back
MILK FIC MENTIONED
ian got so hot
Now if Jenna Marbles came back, my life would be complete ❤
It's crazy that they own smosh again. I just had my mouth open when they revealed it 1:20 The terrible quality makes it seem older than it actually is :D well it is old, but not for me, I was not that early
Is this true smosh is becoming together
"if we burn it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you"  Me: *Sobbing profusely*
I feel so happy for you guys 😭 you are one of the reasons of why I learned English I remember in your early days there's was one latin YouTuber who could dub your videos, that make me curious about your channel !
IT HAPPENED
This video made me wanna cry smosh was my childhood and seeing them coming back together after all this time is just beautiful
IM GONNA CRY!! omg!!
I just want to say that this really gave me closure on this whole situation which felt at the time like a divorce. Watching you two WAS my childhood, it didn't feel like a real week until i watched a sketch or a mealtime video. And when it all stopped it felt like something was torn from me and even though i kept watching because i loved the channel, it really didn't feel the same anymore. Watching you guys talk about your feelings and explain why you felt like you had to leave really made me emotional, and even though it was sad and I didn't like that it happened, I understand why it had to be done and that it would have made you miserable and that it might have ruined the channel for good.  Like you said, I agree that it had to have played out exactly as it did to work and I'm so glad that it did. Watching your return video and seeing Ian's mom come into the room really made it feel like I was a kid again watching my favorite channel.  Thank you two for making such great content for so long. And thanks to Rhett and Link for being so awesome.
do i smell a podcast?
This isnt even Anthony spending a day with Ian it’s them spending time together and then more
i was just rewatching epic lunchtime yesterday. This is amazing 🎉🎉🎉🎉
this is an amazing moment in history
I really love that Rhett and Link were so immediately supportive of Ian and Anthony coming back together as a duo, of course it makes sense considering their similar backgrounds in childhood friends to Youtube duo, but it's great to see legends supporting legends like this.
I cant believe the world is finally beginning to heal.
If this doesn't become one of the most liked videos on YT, I'll be disappointed.  These guys are a big reason why this platform even exists.
My childhood is revived and im so fricken happy
You guys have the opportunity now to change YouTube again! Please don’t hold back! Don’t worry about any anything, be free, don’t sacrifice anything, be truly funny and don’t worry about monetization. The world will bend to you.
my childhood 🥲
When two friends get a well needed therapy session by vibing ❤
Chillls to see you together.
I love this! I’m so happy for them
I hope they've seen just how excited SO MANY people are for this! And shout out to Rhett and Link for helping save it!
this is gonna be on trending
VIVAN LOS NOVIOS
42:00 Been with Smosh since that first year and I'm right here tearing up with you, Anthony. Glad you have your friendship once again
Maybe I’ll go back to my wife
this is just an hour of couple's therapy
Does this mean we are taking out of freezer drawer and defrosting Jenna Marbles too?
its true, you cant break apart best friends
YES
You guys have overcome a hell of a lot. I wish you both all the luck.
When I saw Anthony interviewing Ian by himself I thought wait what about the other guy….until I realized what was going on
I dont usually comment but oh man 🥰🥰🥰
My first Smosh video watched was Boxman. Glad to see we'll be having a Smosh renaissance.
ive wanted to see this video for yearsss, who would'e known it would only come with the best news ever :')
Honestly can tell that Smosh was losing the Soul that it once Had back then so glad to see the Two being the Owners of their channel and company instead of it being filled with Suites.
Now is time for faze to buy their's back
Really impressed by how well Ian knows himself and his ability to communicate and reflect
You guys are legends, thanks for many wonderful memories during my lonley childhood
Finding Twitter Questions
It comes full circle I'm really glad Ian and Anthony are back together as friends now they can make smosh even better before
Dude, Ian and Anthony buying Smosh back is a canon event
Ian gives me Seth Rogan vibes.
marking my place to show i was here during this absolutely revolutionary moment of youtube
Am i dreaming bruh, first i wake up to the video of anthony joining smosh again, and now i back home to this video of ian being on i spent a day with, i am so excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just throwing this idea, but I think a little darker or new kind of humor (as long as you two enjoy it) would be a good route in the future of smosh cause the audience that is most hyped up, and those "kids that got the humor" are not 10 year olds no more, so yeah thats it :) glad to see you back together!
I do think Anthony could branch out. I want him to be freed from this room. “I spent a day with” but he’s doing things with people. Spend a day with chefs and cook something. Spend a day with street performers and learn a short routine. I guess it would take longer to edit and set up but it would be cool a couple times a year
I’m so happy to see you both together again, hugs with butts out
Today we celebrate. 🥂🎉✨
It's like a boy band reunion
"lets burn it to the ground" that shit broke me man I'm so happy
I didn't even recognize him. Ian looks so old I thought he was some random-IT guy somewhere..  Meanwhile Anthony looks as young as ever!
This is great because I've never wanted to look into the whole history of Smosh despite hearing about it constantly because of how many YouTube videos I watch but one thing I think they're forgetting to just touch on just a tiny bit throw in there with the rest of whatever they talked about because it is a good thing to learn about but that the reason kids also started to watch their videos with because they like their sense of humor because they were immature for their age I don't even know what age they were when they made Smosh and maybe you could make the argument that Society was just Dumber back then because of how uncommon being online was but I think the bigger factor is how young they were and that most likely most of the jokes and humor in general coming from the lip sync videos was just the same type of humor as a 10 year old I also think the word Smosh just has people's brains instantly float to a childlike perspective because of how much of a random soft sounding word it is like I'm not trying to be the ambassador of Comedy but I do think that they've never really considered the level of their humor compared to anyone else that genuinely has a different level of thinking and humor entirely
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
lets freaking go 🗣🗣💯💯
You guys were one of the first ever *cyberspace celeberties* I watched as a kid, and its so crazy how much time has gone by, Im 24! So I and I assume a million others are pumped to see this lol cool beans 😎🤙
I feel like a whole part of me is back again. Bc it honestly is, I agree as a long time fan. You guys owning smosh again is definitely the only conclusion for smosh. And this just makes me feel so happy, i’m so excited to see what new stuff you make. Also thanks for resurfacing the mILK FIC MEMORY I SO NEEDED THAT PART 💀💀💀💀🤣
Omg my whole ass childhood right here 😭❤️
holy shit back together
This felt very therapeutic, glad this happened!
Wow i cant believe im watching this, I loved smosh but I also remember binge watching the mail unboxings
this is such a healthy conversation like what the f*ck. i need this in my life.
I SCREAMED when I saw the title and thumbnail. Never clicked a video so fast 😂
Whenever anyone says "it's just business," my immediate response (at least in my head) is, "Thanks, Lord Beckett, now go down with your ship." Companies are just groups of people, and business is just group activities. Everything that a business does will always be personal to someone, at some point, because we're all *human* and, at its core, every business is made of *humans,* too. Anyone trying to keep business "impersonal" will always either fail, or turn themselves into aloof assholes to force that process. And neither of those options is good. For anyone doing any kind of business: *recognize* the humanity in it, account for that, and embrace it.
My first ever interaction with anything on the internet was a Spanish dub of Smosh's Pokemon opening video.  I think many of us owe a lot to these guys. All hail the pioneers of modern entertainment.
To be fair, hats off in ABSOLUTE RESPECT to Rhett & Link, who saved Smosh and were so supportive in giving it back to Anthony and Ian. Come on, they deserve a lot of praise here! <3 <3
85770th.
I can't believe this happening I remember watching Smosh back when I didn't even know english, so to be at this point in my life and seeing them back together it's insane
So...  It finally happened.   ...  Good times:)
Still cant believe mom came home😂
The real Mordecai & Rigby
i could cry. will i? probably! :')
Welcome back Ian we missed ya!! And you/ Anthony bought Smosh Dope!! Can't wait to see what you guys bring down the content pipeline
YALL are NOT ready for the EPIC FOOD BATTLE this year!!
Beef N Go is still the most viewed Smosh video haha
Smosh was the first channel I’d ever subscribed to, the first piece of internet content I distinctly remember seeing and just absolutely obsessing over. Y’all were mine and a lot of peoples childhoods, so to see you guys finally back together, having done so much personal growth and reconnecting and coming back, it feels so full circle. Congratulations and here’s hoping for the future of smosh!
I'm so glad they finally got back together again after nearly all these years. I was crying tears of joy and I was happy for Smosh to return. Thank you Anthony, thank you for coming home to Smosh. Bless you Ian and Anthony. I bet Charlie the Drunk Guinea Pig who is in heaven smiling upon you too today right now. This return of Smosh is nostalgia returning to its glory days once again. I will humbly accept to subscribe to Smosh again.
omg, what a friendship story this is, never knew it was this complicated...it's so nice to see you guys back together !
this is a beautiful moment in history
It is upsetting that I grew up with Smosh and there are children that don't know who they are.
I'm so happy for you guys. All the best for your futures!!!❤
Heart is racing loving this
I miss ian’s hair
next up i spent a day with.. MYSELF??
Why am I crying watching this… thank you Anthony and Ian so much for being so incredible in so many ways over the years, especially now!
You know what? I'm glad these two are coming together again. I discovered Smosh during the pandemic so i had no clue of the history or anything, but considering the amount of friendships that get ruined when you add the business part, it's really nice to see two people rekindle their relationship after all the hardships. I wish you nothing but the best and i hope this new era will bring joy to them and their audience.
This didn’t even feel like an Anthony Padilla “i spent a day with” ,this just felt like two friends reflecting back on what they did and how much it made them laugh and happy
This definitely needed to happen
this conversation felt like therapy for some reason  I'm glad the boyz are back
taking a shot every time the word "smosh" is said lmfao
new assassins creed video coming soon
I appreciate that these guys can finally talk about resentments and what happen to their relationship after they were separated.
Damn, my 34 year old's problems where non existent for 1 hour and 13 minutes. I hope the channel grows better than ever!
MY CHILDHOOD
Can you guys imagine The Smosh Movie: The Director's Cut?
Randomly saw a short of Anthony and decided to check him out, can't believe that he just uploaded this lol
It funny how Anthony and Ian is the whole Smosh while Ian with the other smosh member is not a completed Smosh
1:11:36 anthony has been waiting years for THIS moment
Just seeing the whole timeline and seeing y’all growth really see the change
I was there gandalf. I was there 3000 years ago. Lol seriously tho, this is crazy awesome to see you two together again. Its so funny yall met in 6th grade. In 2006 is when i entered into 6th grade. In all that time and the things that have happened, i didnt think id ever see you two together. Let alone have a serious adult discussion. Im so happy for you guys and myself honestly. Congrats
lunchtime with smosh was an after school staple for me back in high school. so many good memories :')
This was the most heartwarming precious video of the two of you. I'm so glad the two of you have reconnected and found your old spark again and I can't wait to see what the two of you come up with. This was a much needed nostalgic video...   AND THEN YOU BROUGHT UP THE FRICKEN MILK FIC!
I rememeber being like 12 years old and watching every lunchtime with smosh and eating food pretending to be eating with these guys and cracking jokes. I used to dream about winning the chance to eat lunch with smosh for some giveaway they were doing. So cool seeing these guys back together even if its for this one podcast
Had a feeling this video was coming
Hearing them talk about their relationship as people together, is really helping me analyze my own relationship
Nothing better than 2 goofy friends talking serious with each other 💯💯
Can’t wait for food wars 2023
I’m in awe. I remember the day you left, and now the gang is back amen
I'm so glad of the recent news with smosh, best of luck you 2
OH SHIT
YOOOOO
Alternate title: Actually Smosh, the Movie
😮
My childhood 🥹 I’ve been waiting for this moment 😭🥹
Im so happy for them. It's so rare people find their way back to each other after moving on
finally
m
If the first video is FOOD BATTLE 2023 i’ll go insane
smos
Food Wars pl0x
So many of these interviews have brought me to tears, but this one takes the cake. My channel as well as so many other channels out there wouldn’t exist at all if it wasn’t for Smosh. I’m beyond grateful for what you guys have created and what you’ve done for me. I’m so happy for the two of you and I can’t wait to see what you guys have in store for us. Thank you ❤
The Nostalgia
Holy shit this story is unreal
I think Anthony has definitely spent a lot more then a day with Ian. There’s certainly well over 24 hours of footage between the two. Probably a months worth.
So happy for you guys ✨️💕
To think, my first introduction to smosh was their skit "stranded." Its been a wild 16 years.
mention of the milk fic in this video was NOT on my bingo card
I’ll be honest I was never a huge fan of smosh. But I’m still super excited to see you guys get the channel back. I wish you guys the best!
Amazing video, very enjoyable talk!
hell yeah guys!! smosh is back! awesome dudes can't wait to check how it flows now that you guys are all good :)
oh damn, the smosh interview.
today has been one of the greatest days in a while. Ian and Anthony are together again. Youtube feels right again
Can we have Let's do This on Smosh Pit?
I'm so happy, can't even describe how happy I feel rn. I started watching you guys in the 3rd grade (I'm a sophomore now and you guys totally shaped my sense of humor), I remember showing my class the "molester moon" video for show and tell, I don't remember my teacher's reaction but he let me play it until the end, so. This is the best thing that happened to me recently, you guys are the best
This is blowing my mind.
man, I remember being 10 years old, barely well versed enough in English to understand what was being said, but puzzling out what was going on in the early Smosh sketches through context clues with my friends because the few moments we understood made us laugh so hard we were determined to figure out the rest. it’s hard to explain how much those videos meant to me, how much they informed my sense of humor, and how much they contributed to me becoming fluent in an entire language. watching this over a decade later makes me the strangest cocktail of excited, emotional, grateful, and nostalgic I’ve experienced in a hot second. so happy for you guys and I can’t wait to see what you’ll make together!
How will this affect the ghetto smosh legacy?
i need an episode about food blog again xD
It's always a good feeling to see legends coming together again
the dynamic duo is back! ❤
LETS GOOOO!
Ehe. Cox
bro just change smosh no balls xdd
Beautiful to see
THIS IS THE BEST COLLAB EVER! I JUST SH*T MY PANTS!
return of the kings
"Even if it doesn’t do well and we burn it to the ground im happy to do it with you"   that made me cry
This was just made my teenage heart melt. I'm so happy for them both and that they were able to rekindle their friendship! for me the skits isn't what I enjoyed smosh for. It was the lunch time vlogs and the opening fan mail videos that had me hooked! So for me their friendship was always what was the entertaining factor for me. Their unscripted jokes and them being themselves is what made it enjoyable for me. So when that eventually stopped I wasn't as interested in the content. But seeing them now in adulthood and together makes me so happy. Congrats to both of them! I'm so excited for the future for smosh
I’m so happy for. The future of smosh now 🎉🎉
Crazy
As a person who what’s always been a silent watcher for smosh and everything to do with both Anthony’s channel and smosh I just love this and I am super excited for how excited they are 😭
I didn't really watch many videos from Smosh when I was little, however I always associate their videos with the classic nonsensical mischievious videos from old Youtube. Yeah it was the videos I shouldn't have watched as a kid lol.
If they bring back lunchtime with smosh my life will be complete 😂
I feel like a kid again thanks smosh we love you
So are you guys gonna start doing skits together again?
This is what we needed Anthony so glad to see you guys as owners of smosh, and back together as things should be. 10 years later, I still watch your old videos.
Yesss
Where is Ian? Oh... you found him
Watching this a lot of memories came to my mind. Thank you for all the good moments you both gave us 💚
Achievement Unlocked: The Good Ending.
These guys have aged so well into their mid 30s, I still see them as teenagers.
YouTube getting too comfortable with the double 15 sec ads
take a shot every time they say "smosh"
As a 10+ year fan I’m sure me and other fans would love to see a smosh podcast
oh. my. god.
Not even halfway through and this is one of the best, most meaningful, most niche, most beautiful interviews of all time. It’s amazing to hear you guys talk about all of this so honestly. As an OG fan, it’s fascinating and I love seeing you reconnect. Smosh is so special and I love to see you both embracing it together in this new stage!❤ love you guys
Who gives a shit
"if we burn it to the ground I'm happy to do it with you" okay what if i CRIED
So basically Smosh is the reason YouTube is YouTube.
Goated duo so happy y’all are back man, I’ve been waiting for this day
"If we burned it to the ground, I'm happy to do that with you" and Anthony reaction 😭❤️ Excuse me ! That's so wholesome, I can't
🥲
41:41 this is such a beautiful/hilarious/ and human moment
This reminds me of when Will and Jada talked 😮😅
Episode?
I'm not crying you're crying 😥
HOLY. FUCK.
My childhood is healing 😭❤️
Was waiting for this lol.
this is the closure I needed as well as everyone else I think
You really do realise how much Smosh and other youtubers back in the day paved the route for the newer youtubers
This is so beautiful.
Glad to see you back working together again - Cheers all the best
I just wanna say my deepest appreciation for Ian who has been a hard carry for smosh, pushing through all this "alone" and made it through the hard and good times of smosh and now anthony joining back. He's literally the rock and the wheel that keeps smosh grounded and running, which is hard to do if not for his strong passion ❤
That moon emoji video still haunts my nightmares
Bring back ghetto smosh
I can't express how happy I am to have the opportunity to experience this reunion.   I feel like things are somewhat right with the world today.
I'm so happy to see Ian with Anthony again but when do you think Ghetto Smosh will hire them to the team?
This felt like a therapy session... I can feel the back and forth between the two of you with your turmoil, the resentment, the reflection... must've felt so good to let that out of the chest huh and kudos to you guys to be brave and comfortable enough to talk like this and share it with the world  For me Smosh was a childhood icon that never went past the status beyond of my personal hero, like Pewdiepie did to me.  Both of you & pewdiepie rose to fame with comedy and crass type of jokes vibe, but what made Pewdiepie sticks to me more is because he grow to be more personal further than Smosh ever was. Felix shows his vulnerability, his downfall and his rise again more humanly than Smosh ever did.   I wish, with how mature that both of you and Ian has grow, and the resurgence of Smosh, you guys can still create a comedy content, while also create a content that stick with us too, your fans since early 2010s that is closing to late 20s now  And if my opinion matters anything, even with you Anthony, your content is great and I watch them but we rarely ever get to know you further. Perhaps make a smosh podcast where both of you can talk anything beside business and we get to know both of you better?
MORTAL KOMBAT!!!!!!
DUDE THIS IS ACTUALLY SO SICK
Barber shop pole watching this like 👁️👄👁️
It fucking happened guys
Can someone count the number of times Ian says the word "like" I can't unheard it now...
Finally subscribing to Smosh
This video was incredibly raw. I cannot believe the background perspective that these two shared. We really only saw a tiny percentage of this whole “two best friends with a youtube channel” I would’ve never guessed how much pain and how much growth had come with it.
this is actually beautiful because we can finally see in real time how much you guys really think and how you guys react to it its like. woah
I truly believe this video manages to be both one of the most important videos in all of YouTube history and a huge incredibly powerful moment for all of us. I got into smosh a full decade ago and must have watched every video from between 2007 and 2019. When it was just Anthony and Ian and that weird house to just after Rhett and link bought them.  Their conversations and back and forths cover an enterprise that has spanned more than half their lives. It grew faster than they knew what to do with it when they had both barely turned 20, the both spent more than a decade building it up, growing into something that Anthony could no longer care for or recognize, something that slowly destroyed itself through no fault of their own, while Ian stayed on and desperately tried to keep smosh going in the fallout. Growing apart in the process, they’re finally reconnecting after years apart. There is nearly two decades of two of the most important figures in YouTube history, and more importantly, friends, telling their stories from both together and apart. Them now being friends again is the conclusion to the story that knew we needed but hand to keep holding out hope for. It’s so good to see them reminiscing about videos and their past. I’ve watched Anthony for another 5 years now and I can happily say it’s the most important video that will ever be released because it’s not an interview but two friends being real on a podcast.
I really hope that this leads to a Smosh Games reunion where they play Mario Party or something.
I never thought I would see this episode come to fruition. But I couldn't be happier to see it
You guys seem so healthy and seemed to have grown so much as people. I’m sure we’re all SO proud of you guys and so excited to see more from you guys!!!
OHHHH SHIIIITTT
This is just what we all needed. Life finds a way. I can’t wait to find excitement like this again
The world is ok now
Dude. coming back to the business , while working on your two’s professional and personal relationship, would be so rewarding. Use your newly developed creative minds to create something entirely new. I’d personally would love to see more podcasts with both of you. 👍🏽 Congratulations. Truly.
This is literally the best day of my life
I thought it was a good movie . Unique and fun
1:10:59 ian turns into a horse
YESSSSSS!!!!!
Im so beyond happy for this to be back. My inner child has been warm and fuzzy all day. But side not, y'all Ian has been dressing and looking goooood lately
Well well well
Takes me back to the early 2000s man good ol days fr foos str8 up utube was better back then too man I miss those days it was simple and easy life was good jeez man I miss the old smosh but hey they doing good so I can’t complain much love to both of y’all
o, ok that's nice, everyone excuse me. * Goes outside "YEAHSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, F*CK YEAH!"
oh my fuckin god ian saying that at the end hit me so hard
‘ 🎶 all I want is Anthony and all I want is Anthony 🎶 ‘
1:03:53 I am crying. Rhett and Link are so sweet 😢
Anthony has no drip
83k views and 41k likes... that's actually unreal  Congrats to the both of you!!
it makes me very happy seeing you two together in a creative setting again. to see y'all taking accountability while also being completely vulnerable about your feelings, not just about smosh but about your friendship, was really heartwarming to see. i cannot wait to see what you two do next <3
It feels like Rhett and Link took the Smosh seed and protected it until the time was right for them to hand it back over. It seems like they were hoping this would happen! They are truly great men.
I am very happy you and Ian are coming back as a duo ❤️
Wow never knew they were going to collaborate! Truly distinguished men meet for the first time!
This is the happiest day for me in a long time 😭
23:21 so many of us fans , of both channels, agree fully with what Ian is saying.  We've ask for it soooo many times 😢
This is LEGENDARY!
Smoshhhh
Wish Ian opened up more . But the very last line made me cry immediately
sooo happy that we got to hear all those thoughts... It's like a huuuge behind the scene for us who watched as a kid.  Still got that ''FIRETRUCK'' hoodie in my closet.... IM 25 NOW WTF
All of our little kid/teen brains just EXPLODED. Holy nostalgia batman
Best birthday gift I could ever ask for
I need subtitles in Spanish Plssss
After hearing you mention Nathan For You, Nathan Fielder would be such a cool interview 😭, loved this episode !
I nearly cried watching this. Seeing Anthony and Ian together just talking takes me back to watching them as I grew up.
My 13 year old self from 2007 needed to see this
I feel like the internet doesn't "win" too often... this was a much needed win.  Thank you
my favorite gay couple is together again!!!!
I'm now realizing that yesterday, Smosh was a cooperate entity, and I wake up and its independent. That is still blowing my mind
Wow watching this video as a longtime Smosh fan from the golden years was so so so good. You both look so excited and happy and fulfilled to go back to your roots and it’s wonderful to see how much you’ve grown. We are very lucky you decided to be vulnerable and show us both of your sides of the story, and I’ll be there to support this new age! Congrats again! ❤️
Food battle 2023 let's go!!!
Im only 1:11 in and im already emotional 🥺❤️
Wait are we going to get classic Smosh videos now like the if pokemon was realistic
dude while listening to this i was like "damn sucks this will only last for like 13 minutes" BAM 1 hour AND 13 MINUTES. c: thanks
The video I've wanted for years
it's only at this very moment that I realize this       Ian really looks like Charlie Day
oh man what a video to wake up to  legends
🌌🪞🖼
its so fucking crazy to me that a lot of people dont know smosh
speaking for everyone when i say you guys needed this
Okay Pokemon let them have it this time
Imagine a new food battle after a decade
This is everything to me. So happy for you both and super excited for the future!
Welcome back gentlemen! Good to see you two together again!
Wow, I had no idea that your friendship with Ian kinda deteriorated, Im glad you two got back together though
Man, I'm having a terrible day today, but seeing that SMOSH is coming back really eases the pain. This news couldnt have come at a better time :)
The first thing i did after i saw the video on smosh was going here.
Dude this still blows my mind. Really cool. Stoked to see Anthony back in the mix at smosh and interacting with the new folks.
2 legends❤
Honestly its a good thing you guys didn’t “drake and josh” things and you guys rekindled your friendship
Man this is awesome.
I’m about to cry these guys are sooo real and seeing them interact again just brings back nostalgia. Also seeing how open they are to each other and how you can tell how deep this got is just incredible
OG SMOSH IS BACK BABY
Chucha, I grew up with you guys... welcome back, Smosh.
FRIENDSHIP ALWAYS WINS
This reminds me of one of the last episodes of unus annus
I told my brother that you guys got back together and it blew his mind just as much as it did mine!
Next Episode: MatPat: “We bought back Game Theory”
23:27 honestly i don’t see a problem with Anthony doing this, if he didn’t do this I think people would just see him as Anthony from smosh. He wanted to do his own thing and I don’t think Ian really understood that
Holy shit! Congrats you two!!
I kinda wish there was some closed captions(was waiting at the hospital)
younger me is screaming with excitement right now
I knew when this would happen I expected the reason being because of a colab but the fact that it’s cause they’re both back to working together makes it more hype
Wow… my childhood
Yeeeeeeesssssss
Listen y’all. I knew one day this would happen. In my heart of hearts I knew Ian and Anthony would become one again and Smosh would become more powerful than even the ancient magics!! May your reign be long and fruitful!! BESTIES FOR LIFE!!❤❤❤
holy shit fr
You two are my favorite people
28 year old adults being called to open up Wattpad for the first time in a decade
Please don't take betterhelps money or spread their message. Please do some research, what they do is just awful.
I'm glad Anthony finally interviewed Ian, it's like a genuine conversation between two brothers
SMOSH IS BACK!
Day 1 of commenting until they bring boxman back.
Butts out hug is the best
Can we please get a “What if we never sold Smosh” sketch
*coughsmoshsummer/wintergamescough*
the inner child in me is utterly and completely healed. i cannot wait for this new (returned??) era of smosh! this was incredible so happy for you both!
Ooh! So glad to see you do an episode with Ian! I'm so glad that it sounds like Link and Rhett made this transition fairly easy for you guys, or at least as easy as it could be.
Tears in my eyes almost the whole time. So happy for you guys
Does this mean.... food battle is back?... food battle 2024??
Smosh talking like they’re in therapy so wholesome
Food Battle 2023?
what
this is like my parents getting back together but like 150x better holy shit
Bro this was so amazing to see. I didn’t realize it got to the point of affecting your actual friendship. Awesome real conversation.
You guys should work together and call your channel "SMOSH" or something idk
This is an opportunity to see a back to formula Smosh, but with a mature creative process
1:12:55 a milk fanfic mention in 2023 😭😭
A whole generations childhood has reappeared
SMOSH is back BABY!
So happy to see our boys together again. ❤
This whole story is so inspiring. This is the best news I have heard all year.
Literally OGs of YouTube. One of the first few to start a channel
Now that’s what we’re thinking
i love that you can see how comfortable and happy they both are to be around each other again ❤
Future content aside, I do think it will be interesting to watch the dynamics as Anthony steps back into his role. For many of the cast & crew Ian has been at the helm and the leader through the Defy Debacle, The Mythical save, Covid and onward so I think even with people who worked with Anthony before, I image a strong bond for cast/crew has been formed with Ian so it will interesting to watch as Anthony steps back into a leadership role after these past years and how everyone meshes back together
Loved your guy’s old videos all those years ago
What does everyone mean when they say they got the channel back and they own smosh again
food battle 2023
41:54 Rejected  43:29 Rejected more
My fathers are back😭😭😭
GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE TBH
I'm extremely pleased these two are back at the helm of Smosh.  But Ian, my dude, you gotta stop saying "like"
Let gooooooooo
I can’t imagine what re-establishing and re-defining that friendship felt like. Man, life is mental sometimes.
I didn't watch Smosh before watching Anthonys channel, and from what I got from this interview is that there much progress in their relationship, although I do see there are still walls up between these two. I hope to watch them grow and evolve together in this next chapter! You really catch it at 40:41 where they talk about reconnecting, and you can feel the struggle Ian has talking about opening up. Anthony - "We go to lunch and realize the walls are down?" Ian - "No, it's just that we, you know, we grew as people but the things that we in terms of comedy, you know, it hadn't changed that much." It seems Ian is cool with him on the business end of thing now (like comedy), but my gut says there's some personal stuff here between them that will continue to keep those walls up.   There is clearly progress in their relationship, and as individuals...I'm grateful to see that! I'm excited to see what is in store for them :)
Holy shit…. I needed this.
This is such a bittersweet feeling❤️ I have loved and supported you both separately since I was a kid and it’s amazing to see how far you both have come and the growth that you’ve both gone through to get here today❤️ Congratulations to you both
I like these OG YouTuber Videos
I will never forget teleporting fat guy.  He was a cultural staple of my childhood.
56:26 for future reference
Gosh I cried last night and this is going to make me cry again GAHHH
Can’t wait for “I spent a day with Anthony”
Miss u guys ! Man you've all been here since the BEGINNING of youtube ! THE OG'S !
Seeing them opened up the past, food battles and how yt was so different back then. life was much more simple back then
Speaking of people assuming that Smosh was for little children, my parents were convinced that Smosh was for adults (almost p0rn) because of the intro for one of the pokemon in real life videos starting with "hey girl, let me fondle your jigglypuffs" or something like that😂
Please do a SMOSH LIBS again please
I never thought I would see this
I've been waiting for this collab... but i had no idea how big it would be 🥹
Yay
it's crazy to think if the teacher didn't pair them of for that science project smosh wouldn't exist
This isnt an interview, this was a reunion.
THE SMOSH!
I didn't expect to cry I can tell you that right now. I was a TRUE smosh fan back in the day starting with the og food wars :( I'm truly excited boys!
Huge congrats to Anthony and Ian! Is it too soon to look forward to Food Battle 2023???
Id love to see some comedy mixed with tragedy in the future. Id love to see more serious acting with some good comedy
I’m honestly shocked that you guys both own smosh again. Congrats! Hope you guys can rekindle the old feelings lol
In an alternate universe, Anthony stayed in Smosh But in another universe, Ian left Smosh with Anthony.
Food fight 2023?
tbh this is like the history of smosh in one hour
The return of boxman??
I need an Anthony Padilla Funeral and then it'll come full circle!! Love that you guys are together again <3 <3 <3
the fact that y'all own smosh again is fuckin amazing. Time to set up the most awesome comeback of all time.
Why didn't they meet any other time tho like what was stopping and what did they mean they own smosh again..did ian lose it or something
now we can say again ANTHONY FROM SMOSH
Y'all aged like fiiiine wine ❤️
This feels that a dream
make food battle 2023!
This is amazing!  To come back after learning and experiencing so much and working on your mental health.  This interview is so ridiculous.  Congratulations.
This is a great conversion. great to see the two of em together
LETS GOOOO
I don't think it's necessarily that feelings mean conflict. We have feelings and that's how it is. It sounded like the conflict wasn't necessarily the feelings itself but poor communication in terms of how you two felt. As a result it led to passive aggression. Does this sound right?
These guys work really well together they should do more collabs
History being made. Glad I could be here for this!
I never cry....wait why are my eyes sweating?
i feel like this video was really therapeutic for them to make (maybe not the video exactly but this whole process) there's nothing worse than having an unfinished feeling in your life
wow 1hr! this is a whole movie HAHAHAH literally better than the smosh movie
Wow I’d did not expect this.
You guys were both from my hometown 🥹
Thank you god for letting me see this moment happen
Anthony is home now the world can heal
brb gonna read the milk fic again
Shout out to Rhett and link after that company fell and they helped the warped zone get their own channel back and give it to them as they were in talks to buying Smosh from the bank.
my childhood is healed!
FOOD BATTLE 2023!
This is so wholesome im so happy for these guys <3
Bro I didn't even watch much Smosh as a kid, this pod is amazing
This brought so many emotions- Nostalgia, appreciation, sadness, understanding, excitement. Very curious how things will be going forwards
The real Smosh
I've been watching youtube videos regularly since 2006, and while I never got super-big into smosh, I know that the two of you, as well as a couple others, are the godfathers of this format. You guys helped make this website what it is. I've had friends since 2006 that grew up with me watching youtube, so when Anthony left, it was kinda shocking to see two friends who had been so as long as my friends split up. Friendships are hard, but if people are meant to be friends, you'll wind up coming back to each other. Glad to see this for so many reasons, mainly for the two of you.
This is not an interview. This are two great guys who created the best channels in Youtube and reminiscing their glory days before Smosh fall very hard after Anthony left. Im soooo happy they are back together and bought back Smosh. I cant wait for their videos again. Congratulations to both of u and long live Smosh!!!
Weird, when you two sit next to each other, you kinda look like those Smosh guys who just got their channel back.
This feels like their working through alot in this video, even stuff they haven't personally talked about. Like in some moments I feel that they don't entirely agree with something (which of course is to be assumed). I don't mean this in like a "They should work things out before coming onto this." I mean it in a way that is like, we get to see them talk through this and understand eachother.
I can't believe it's been nearly 20 years since the first time I saw these 2 on my computer screen. Please never stop creating! You're the reason I'm still trying to create all kinds of my own content to this day :)
Can you please put subtitles on this vid? I’m hard of hearing 😓😫
also Ian’s outfit goes hard
Wish Smosh good luck and all the best. Happy to see the reunion
as my life is falling apart, it come back together
I keep waiting for the joy to end with a “JUST KIDDING” and it’s not!!!
I own smosh the movie 😂😭
Yyyyyeeeeeaaahhhhh
Seeing y’all talk through things so calmly and honestly is so satisfying and refreshing. I’m so happy you’re getting another fresh start to friendship ❤❤
"Are the fan-fictions gonna start again??" Sir, all due respect....... Did they ever stop?   Also, I had nearly completely erased the Milk-Fic from my memory, so thanks for that war-flashback... Can't believe I'm happy for the both of you.
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh
It’s so great to see them together again after quite a while. They are literally YouTube legends.
Existing isn’t exhausting
1:11:30 Get you a friend like this 😭
RETURN OF FOOD BATTLE ??🎉🎉🎉😢😢😢
I wanna recognize how cool rhett and link are for being supportive to their creative freedom. They have always seemed to be genuinely good guys.
Holy fuck that man just said "ROFL'ing"
I wish I was still friends with my old friends waaay back in the day. We would argue about who was cuter. Would love to argue about it again today watching this video! 🤣
This was such an honest and mature conversation, love the glow up
Really cool to see you both together again! Smosh was my childhood and I was a bit sad when I moved on from it when you went separate ways bit the memories I made back then are timeless and ill never forget them
smosh kids on shut up cartoons & a pokemon in real life continuation are the two things im wishing for... prayge... other than that im so excited for everything moving forward and i wish you two the best of luck on everything! <3
I'm curious if Ian called and told Anthony about Defy going under or did Anthony find out on the internet?
Oh my god
It's finally happening 🙌 🥲
16:09 i pictured James from Dead Meat doing his " business" yell lmao. Hope others get this
The most awaited episode but it comes with such a beautiful gift that we didn't even think would be possible anymore. 💜
I'm so glad that Rhett and Link were so on board
Simply the best childhood.
My inner child is healing
The best collaboration of history
W
Smosh was my childhood this makes me very happy can’t wait for what happens next
Honestly props to Rhett and Link for caring more about the excitement of the whole situation and celebrating with Ian than worrying about the business side of it all
Seeing their faces together in the thumbnail confused my brain so badly lol it was like this is so right but so wrong but so right 😂 either way I'm so excited for this interview ❤
not even joking, I've been waiting for this video to release since THE VERY FIRST video of this series. Seeing you 2 tk together like this is really making me realise how much every long time fans have grown
You cannot just drop like this and liek ahahahaha
Time really flies wtf
As one of those kids who probably shouldn't have been watching Smosh  Im thrilled to see them together again
you both deadass have main characters of youtube energy
omg not the fanfic mention at the end . i’ll never be able to escape my wattpad days
This feels like the final boss level of a video game and I love it.
I'm so glad to be part of this journey with you lot. This is amazing!
I was not 100% convinced that this come back culd work but after watching this video i find hope for the project
Having spent my entire high school years watching classic smosh, it’s so strange seeing Ian and Anthony talking to each other outside of their performance personas. It’s also heartbreaking knowing now what they went through. I wish for only the best for both of them taking back Smosh and making it their own.
When your mom takes a wrong turn off the highway and you wind up taking a 10 year detour to wind up back where you made the wrong turn:
My inner child is screaming right now thank you for this!
As a long time viewer of both, this feels like not only a therapy session for you guys but also for us fans. This was such a great conversation, I’m so glad and excited for this next chapter
Wholesome rollercoaster ride.
Yes
So....Food Battle 2023 when?
Smosh getting back together is healing to my inner child.
It's really shocking to see Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla back together again Smosh is back baby let's go 😢😱🤯🤩💯🔥🔥
THE COLLAB WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR
The Reunion 🫶🏼😁
No way someone farted at 1:42
youtube to me was just for watching smosh video back when im still in highschool glad you two are back together
Smosh the Movie walked so terrible Youtube Red movies could also walk
How about spending a NIGHT with IAN HECOX 😉
Can confirm, I was one of those people who decently enjoyed the Smosh movie
As it should be.
I AM SO HAPPY SMOSH IS BACK. THIS IS AMAZING AND WHOLESOME
The Panic at the Disco fandom is so sorry about the milk fic genre
The like to view ratio is insane! Love to see it
My daughter introduced me to Smosh with the Mortal Kombat video years ago. It makes me so happy to see these two together again.
I am so excited about this!! I can't wait to see the sketches you guys have so far and in the future, I know they'll be amazing and hilarious. ☺
If Anthony is returning to smosh does that mean food battle will return?
Don't ever box what Smosh should be, ever again. Smosh can be more than the comedy videos we loved. Content like this very candid video, I think fits to what Smosh can be. But also another mistake that can be avoided is how in the past, Smosh was forced to be something else that shouldn't be. TV Shows, movies, etc. Just too much commercialized vibes. Smosh can be a personality based channel again. The both of you have personalities that are interesting enough, and even the rest of the Smosh members.
2 days before my b-day finally it happened
wow what a video
The parent company that shall not be named
i watched howie mandel's podcast just couple weeks ago and i remember you said that the two of you have been reconnecting? or something like that. by then, as a smosh fan, i was just happy to have that information lol, little did i know that it would lead to this
SMOSH was how I found out about youtube way back in 2005 and I watched everything they ever did for a long time.   What Ian and Anthony did when they were younger inspired me when I was younger to have fun and follow my passions. I'm glad they are both having an incredible journey in the digital world.
One of those full circle moments in life. Childhood me is happy 😂
Random Tuesday night... What beauty is before me?
As someone with a longtime Childhood friend, where we also hit a lull in our relationship to the point we weren't talking at all but eventually reconnected; The part where they talked about reconnecting and looking beyond their childhood friendship made me emotional. This also coupled with the fact that old school Smosh was my childhood, made me tear up (joy) at watching this video. I can't wait to see how Smosh will change with you two at the helm again, and as full blown adults too! (kinda)
31:14 WTF WHYYYY!?!?!!
holy fuck
its all happening
The earliest video I can ever remember watching on YouTube was Smosh Games Connect Animals (or whatever the title is) with the black panther kitten. Ever since then you guys have had your hooks in me. I remember showing my mom the video where you react to Kids React reacting to Food Battle. She just stared while I though it was the funniest shit ever! Now I’m 21 with my own hopes and dreams. Watching the story of Smosh unfold in real time has been some of the best inspiration. Through you guys I’ve learned that life has its ups and downs but ultimately what matters is staying true to yourself and going after your goals, not the goals of others. The key to success is surrounding yourself with people who you love and want to see succeed, and they want the same for you. No matter what shit gets thrown your way, just keep your head up and try and make the best of it. Here’s to 21 more years of Smosh! 🍻
The defy email sounds like it was the equivalent of breaking up with your girlfriend through text instead of in person
Been a fan since I was in highschool. Now I just finished med school. Hearing about this takes me back! Will be rooting for you guys!
Not everyone has the chance and personal growth needed to recover a lost friendship but I'm glad we got to witness this.. Thank you for sharing this with us viewers..  Watching this reminds me when I listened to both of you talking about smosh in rhett and link's podcast. Now I hope this relationship can blossom for more years to come
I'm very excited to see the future of Smosh
I just KNOW that Brittany Broski is hyperventilating and cry-laughing over the last 2 minutes of this video xD
This is like when Kobe and Shaq had that sit down. This is awesome
It would have been funny if the video just had a cutout of early 2000's Ian with a tapped speaker that just plays voicelines
Lunchtime with Smosh please
Bruh I was born the year smosh started. I started watching around the age of 7ish and I did watch a lot of their older content but it was because of my older sister I even found the channel. Here I am at the age of almost 18 finally getting to see smosh re-ignite the flame it once had. And I also find it crazy that you guys started back around the time I just started thinking “dang I wish smosh was back because I miss it”. So pretty much blame my sister for making your content look like children’s content.🤣🤣  (I love you guys work and good luck on keeping it fresh❤)
Ian’s fit goes hard af tho ❤ so excited y’all are back together on Smosh ❤❤
I like how this is also like a "i spent a day with Anthony Padilla"
I'm so happy for the two of you!! I remember finding your channel back during the summer of fifth grade (11), and I connected with someone who would be my best friend at the time. Although we've lost touch, this was so emotional watching and just reliving everything happily. I just wanted to say thank you for just being yourselves.
This is gonna be kick ass
this was fantastic. i’m so glad you both have found you’re groove again! the 10 year old me who had a smosh fan account is so happy rn, and the current 21 year old me is just as happy!!! i’ll be supporting you guys all the way on this new journey <3 now time to go on a smosh binge…
Seriously had the worst last couple weeks, this news TOTALLY brightened the whole month!! So excited ❤️💙❤️ the world is getting back to the way it should be 😮‍💨😮‍💨💙💙
This was the REAL 1 Hour Special that everyone wanted to watch
Bruh this legit a podcast episode
Loved the honesty and the genuine talk you both had. Really enjoyed the video and the insight you two gave us. I'm glad you guys followed the path that felt right. You guys got far and will always be absolute legends <3
Wait has the fireplace always been off centered…
Finally, the "where's Anthony" jokes will end
I'd love to see you guys with Rhett and Link and the whole rundown on them purchasing Smosh and selling it back
MY CHILDHOOD!
Dude my 13 year old self is fired the fuck up
HOLY SMOSH IS BACK!!! MY CHILDHOOD! TBH I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST A NORMAL EPISODE OF "I spent a Day with"
These guys are what I mean when I say not all soulmates are romantic partners
Damn,the way Ian knows you soooo well. Kind of incredible to see yall talk this out
When food fight?
I remember being maybe like 10 and watching smosh videos and giggling, I am now 20 and it’s so amazing to see smosh being smosh again
Why do I feel like crying seeing you two together 😭💕
I have gotten 4 "smosh" videos today, life is on the up and up
Bring the bowl haircut and emo hair back! Lmao
Omg congrats on buying back Smosh
Now that we got this classic collaboration it’s time for the next one. The YouTube gods in their time. I spent a day with Ray William Johnson
I want to see 1 last smosh vid with this two written by the two of them 😭
"We were wrong, Jamal ate himself" still pops into my head completely unsolicited 17 years later
Where's Ian's mom she needs to be here too
It was super interesting to hear about how your friendship got weird turned into a facade at one point, would have thought that could be childhood crushing to hear but instead it made the friendship more real and relatable, im happy to see you reconnected
Bring back mail time with Smosh
Very heartbreaking to hear what unraveled during the lifetime of Smosh. Like dang, this is a cautionary tale for all aspiring entertainers  out there.
Hahaha! 😂 XD
Shut Up!
Greetings from the JARmy glad u guys patch things up i hope u don't hate the JAR anymore Ian
I saw this episode coming since the MatPat episode. I just knew that Smosh would be together again somehow and I’m so glad that I turned out to be correct. ❤
I got into smosh only a few months ago so I don't have the attachment like other fans here, but is so obvious how important smosh is in internet culture even outside of english youtube. They paved the way and is truly heartwarming seeing a legend back in its roots, thousands of people reliving so many memories and just watching a good friendship resurface. I'm so happy to see everyone's reactions and can't wait to see what the future delivers in this new stage.
my childhood!!!!! please bring it back
Ok time travelers we know where it started
"if we burn it to the ground, i am happy to do that with you" 😭😭
imagine if these 2 never became classmates in the 6th grade  crazy how a small thing can change everything
i was excited before, but watching you two in this was so much fun and and wholesome. im so stoked.
I’m disturbed people don’t know what smosh was
i was one of those kids that probably shouldn't have been watching smosh (*molester moon flashbacks*) but I'm glad I did and now I'm 20 ready to laugh my ass off again😂
YIPPEE
Legends
I remember watching them when I was like 6, thinking they were the funniest people in the world. Still do
Some of my favorite Cyberspace celebrities
Wasn't just an interview for Ian it was also one for anthony too
that's one long video man
This is so amazing!!!!
so happy watching this. great stuff
OMG
Bro I was trying to find this for months, glad it’s here
Wow
When is food battle gonna come back
Wholly Shit I Miss These Two Reuniting With Each Other Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox I Haven't Cried This Much of a Duo Coming Back Together Since Drake Bell & Josh Peck Returned Together As BFF's Again Anthony and Ian Creators of *(SMOSH)*❤❤❤❤😭😭😭😭😭 THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!
BOXMAN
All im hearing from them is what happened is the CANON event
It has arrived!
Just watched the full video and felt like it went by in 5 minutes. It's so good to see you two together again excited with the new project and ready to take on this adventure, but also more open and mature to resolve conflict. I'm all in with what comes next in Smosh!
man, I was the biggest smosh fan when I was younger. you two are funny as hell, and you are both two of the most iconic people in youtube history. mad love to you both 💖
9:44 lol and now those ten year olds are your most loyal watchers 🥰
I- thi- wha- um-.... im am in shock, wth
Holy shit! No one in my everyday life understands how huge this is! I’m so happy for smosh
i need a video with smosh, watcher, and good mythical morning
Yay!! My favorite duo is back and better than ever ❤️
Use me as the SHUT UP button
OMG 😧😧😧
The video I’ve been waiting to see for many years. Happy to see Ian and Anthony in the same YouTube video again.
10:11 yes
Bring the smosh games gang again, sohinki, lasercorn, mari, joven, etc
Ooo so late
Well since Smosh is back, let's get ERB back as well starting their season with Ian versus Anthony rap battle then bring the whole Smosh crew.
Typing this mid way through, I'm glad to be apart of the generation that grew up with smosh
Will we get ElSmosh back too? Because that would be amazing for you Spanish speaking fans!
So happy about this news. Joined Smosh immediately and can't wait to see all the things coming. As a long-time fan of Mykie's horror videos... I wonder if there is a distant chance she might appear in some of these. She's been absent from Youtube for a long time (And like everyone, I only wish the best for her), but it would be cool.
My childhood 🥲💕
Make movie Smosh 2.0!?!
And to think that this channel started with a lube sandwich
I’m so excited to see what will come from this and I’m so happy they’re back together
A little 8 legged birdy informed me that Anthony leaving Smosh was a cannon event
I saw the "WE BOUGHT SMOSH" video earlier and almost died. I can not believe they are getting back together!
YAY
This makes me want to reconnect with some old friends
When they talked about the new cast being more popular than them at a time, I honestly believe the new cast is what was the downfall of Smosh and the views show it. I'm glad they're back again
The Boys Are Back Together!
I'm so glad their back
Happy for you guys, can’t wait to see what y’all are gonna do <3
I've only been a fan of smosh for about 2 years. But the more I looked into smosh. The more I enjoy it. Even at 37. I'm really glad you guys got this catharsis.
Good to see them back together. Smosh was arguably one of YouTubes founding fathers.
"Literally rofling" - Anthony Padilla 2023
Im literally in tears, I love these guys so much.
The collab we all know we needed, and that they needed  now the question remains...  Smosh movie sequel?
MY CHILDHOOD
I remember being 8 or 9 watching you guys on YouTube and watching your food battles and skits and my parents telling me I wasn’t allowed to watch the videos cause they were inappropriate but I still did anyways and you guys always made me laugh, you guys were my childhood and I will forever be grateful that I became a fan of you guys, being 18 now seeing the videos now I still laugh at them now knowing the jokes, I’m so happy you guys are now a team again with buying smosh❤️
2010 ERA WON
I can't wait to see videos from these two like old times again!
do we know what smosh is.. OF COURSE WE DO
Crying from the nostalgia, it happened, it’s back, it’s the best day ever 😭
I feel like my mum and dad are getting back together😂
oh shit they own smosh again? the world is really on the path of healing😇😇😇
Now that Anthony is part of Smosh again, I wonder if we will see I spent a day with Shayne, or Courtney, or Damien, or any other Smosh member.
Food battle 2023?
SMOSH WAS MY LIFE WHEN I WAS 8-10 i literally drew the iconic logo on my wall and got in trouble lmao IM SO HAPPY THEYRE GUNNA BE BACK!!!
Amazing!
omgggg
Seeing them together again in a video is a dream come true
I really wish I could've seen everybody at Smosh finding out. The fact that they had already shot stuff and they didn't even know
Anthony & Ian, I’m so happy Original Smosh is coming back ❤❤ I can’t believe this is happening. I love you both so much, thank you for making my childhood amazing. I can’t wait to see the amazing content ❤
Wow as someone who grew up watching smosh this makes me so incredibly happy for you both makes me so emotional seeing you two together. I got through some lonely times watching you both!
The bros are back together. You love to see it🙏
I’m not gonna say smosh is back but I’m looking forward to the next thing y’all make, been there for a long time so I’m happy
😮😮😮😮😮🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 I miss you guys😢
My depression went away just a little, this is amazing
I'm so happy Ian evolved into an accountant
Do a smosh video again
Ian is so underrated and underestimated. For those of us who really only have watched Smosh post-Anthony and post-Defy, Ian was the glue and beacon of light that held Smosh together
The once was 10 year olds are still here today! SHUT UPPP!!!!
Anthony’s canon event was leaving smosh
Yo it’s nice seeing the two of them being so real. Can believe our childhoods are back.
it feels like a closure also in the way that this isn’t like an interview, it’s just a conversation with an old friend
This isn’t an interview, It’s a full reunion
I was thinking about this collab just a few hours ago and then this releases.. wth😂
so hyped for this video!! Ian and Anthony are the 🐐🐐🔥
Now they can make a movie about rise and fall from smosh, damn, that'd be good
A crazy video, but one I was hoping for a long time. As someone that was an old long time fan, and was there during the first food battle episodes. I'm incredibly glad that anthony's venture by himself created this awesome channel that exists now, that even I was doubtful at first. It's awesome seeing you two together again no matter the circumstance.
I AM LIVING FOR THIS
I like how both Anthony and Ian are admitting the Smosh movie wasn't all that good
Why did such an important episode come out today
now we just need the og intro
Everyone this is youtube history you are witnessing.
Ohh shit i feel this is going to blow up👀
THEY’RE BACK
FREE GHETTO SMOSH
Yes thank god
I used to watch y’all with my older brother, even tho I was way to young to watch it but it was still so funny
This made my soul happy Fr 😼
I'm not crying, Anthony's crying 😢
I basically grew up watching your guys original videos in the early Youtube days with Nigahiga, then around what people call "new Smosh" I went through a bunch of adult stuff... college, military, career, marriage, etc. so I didn't really get into that era of Smosh until about 3 years ago when I started watching Youtube regularly again. Your guys' journey is crazy and your content is awesome. Can't wait to see what more you guys come out with!
I hope doing SMOSH together again doesn’t put you two back in the same position you were in before. Hoping the years apart and individual self growth have healed these wounds and make you two stronger than ever!!
Favorite episode
the fact that this is 70 minutes long omg 😭😭
Shout out to Diana! She’s a real one for getting these men to reconnect! Happy to see ya together again
You guys did this perfectly. The debut on the smosh channel ylyl leading into this incredible sit down talk. It's beautiful to see you two come together again, and the way I can tell you two made the decision together on when to release these videos is almost artistic. I cant wait to see what comes next.
Like
OH WOW CONGRATS FOR SMOSH !!!!
Finally they make a video together
I have been waiting for this for years. Still watching the ads but I am so excited lol
Started with smosh plays slenderman, haven’t stopped since. much love
The smosh movie is so bad it’s circled back to funny imo
Quite literally, this is as much as "I spent a day with SMOSH" for us.
wait does this mean food battle is coming back 2023 XD
I do hope your relationship gets better from here on out. I appreciate that you guys reconnected and allowed yourselves to be friends again
Dude, this is like the craziest long-term youtube story arc I've ever seen. Unmatched.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the greatest day of my life
C'mon Ian is safe to be vulnerable 🤗 I feel like he is still holding back because he has been on the internet too long and is a hostile place
Oh my god I never thought I wouild ever see the day you two reunite. Life really does come around every so often and I am so happy for the both of you
my brain hearing this news: "SHUT UP!"  no but for real, I am beyond excited for this new chapter and the revival of og Smosh content
This feels like a dream seeing them back together again.
Bye the fact I had no idea anthony was smosh I’m in shock
healing era
I can’t believe I’m watching this collab rn 😭
could replace the word smosh with marriage & this would be a standard therapy session between divorcees 😅❤‍🩹
No captions?
I didn’t grow up with smosh but I do understand their impact on YouTube, and because of that, seeing these two togeather again is somehow emotional for me.
I can't wait, I think making Smosh smaller would be nice. There is so many people in Smosh now it feels to businessy. Can't wait for the new content.
I'm not crying! YOU'RE crying!
We missed Anthony over on smosh
Words cant even explain how happy this video makes me. Welcome back you two
i just came
And you'll be spending many more days together! ❤
I love this, but I still don't like Ian's vibe, and not just now, I saw this "thing" bout him like 6 or 7 years ago But idk, I hope nothing strange or bad happens between them or the new (not new) smosh channel
hearing ian say courtney shayne olivia noah keith in this video feels like my avengers endgame moment
The people want Sex Ed part 2 and yes, we demand ISMFOF do the music again too
This was so cool to watch! So cool to see you guys talk about everything. I'm so happy and excited for the future! Can't wait for SMOSH 2023!! LETS GOOOO!!! 😁😁😁
oh ok
Can't wait to see transformers rap back on the @smosh channel again lmao
SMOSH was my childhood, man 😔
I’m so proud of both of these people. Ian carrying Smosh on his own for a few years now and Anthony making his own great content only for them to come together once again — is just such an inspiring journey. I’ve been rooting for them both separately, didn’t see this moment coming at all, tis a nice surprise nonetheless. What a ride. I’m still holding my breath for when/if Jenna Marbles return, that’d be such a dream.
All the 90s kids rejoicing
Ian's clothes gives me the pedo serial human deleter vibes
We love a reunion!!!🥳😭💕💕💕💕💕👏👏
Holy shit their back!
This......nostalgia is flowing
As a child at the time of the Smosh Golden Age- I absolutely should not have watched Smosh but I’m so glad I did. Seeing Anthony and Ian own their company again is one thing right again in this world and I feel like I’m 7 again. Im almost 21 and it’s amazing
41:40 for the biggest emotional catharsis you'll ever see 😢
idk bout anyone else but i’m having a great time seeing Ian and Anthony reunite
after that many years spending almost every day together, it's no wonder you both needed a break. I always imagined that you'd get back to being close because that long of a friendship doesn't just end - but I'm so excited for you both that you're reconnected and passionate about the future.  (ps: while smosh the movie is objectively not great, I do still really enjoy it)
They finally found where's Anthony! :0
Lunchtime with Smosh reboot WHENNN ❤️
I just watched the smosh announcement I’m so excited!!
9:20 This is extremely true. I discovered smosh when i was 4 years old, I thought it was the funniest shit in the world. I’m 15 now and i still find those vids to be a laugh riot. Keep doing what you guys enjoy.❤️
🐐 🐐
Dude there getting the band back together!!
As a viewer of smosh since 2005 this is so incredible to witness. Two old time best buds linking up again to bring so much laughter and creativity. Can't wait!
They should have opened it up with the classic “shut up!!!”
i’m as old as smosh ^•^
Bro i Called it i Knew This Would Be An Episode
Such a heartwarming video to see, I audibly gasped when it popped up in my home feed. Cheers, guys!
This is insane, I’m so excited.
It would be cool to have captions so I can understand what was said the first time around 😅😅😅
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMGGGGGG!!!!! 😮😮😮❤🇵🇭
Yesssssss yessssss yessssssss
I can't believe you guys got smash back and now I'm just so happy
so happy smosh is back together. one of the best comebacks in ages and thank you for opening up to us even though yall do not have to
There HAS to be a 2023 food battle. Or I'm suing.
We finally came full circle after all the hurdles
These guys need to make their own duo YouTube channel or something.
Just a nonchalant gigantic reveal in the first 45 seconds?
You guys are the reason I have a dark sense of humor and thank you!😂
anthony 都不會老的嗎
I’ve waited YEARS for this moment
So happy that SMOSH is back
Im happy that smosh is back together, im just worried what that will mean for Anthony's content... I absolutely love the ISADW series and if it ends i will be very upset
Finally... I have waited for this for years 😭😂
Can't wait to see Anthonymon in smosh again 😂
Today is honestly. Today was unexpectedly the greatest day ive had in years because of this reuniting. I love these boys. So happy to see you both back together working on smosh. Thank you so much.
0:39 gyaatttt butt anyways these 2 talking about life and the past and the future just is so heartwarming
the bought out smosh was an abomination. and it wasnt even funny
I am crying ong
I am so drunk today i need to add this to my watch later list
Thank you for this. I recently lost someone who i loved very dearly she was like a sister to me. We had a very very similar relationship like you guys. There would be times we wouldnt be friends bc things would get in the way but every time we got back together it was like there was never a break to begin with. We always picked up right were we left off. We would literally call each other best friend soul mates. The recent loss of my soul mate shattered me for the last few weeks. Seeing this makes me so happy. Seeing you guys getting back together after everything really reminds me of the friendship of me and my friend. Im so excited to see what you guys have in store for us. Love you guys!!!!!!!!
Does this mean SMOSH Babies is back?
Wow, I've been watching you guys since 2009 and i am 23 now. Seeing you guys together again makes my inner child so happy.
3 weeks ago the algorithm was recommending me Anthony's channel. Glad I was able to witness this gem when it dropped
i knew it.
W
What a great day it is, yes indeed
the arch has finally resolved 😌  I just could not be happier rn
I'm happy that you guys got smosh back.
Today is a great day to be alive. History in the making
I started watching you all when I was 11 or 12 and now I’m 21. Recently I started watching the old videos again, watching old Smosh games and lunchtime with Smosh and seeing this amazing news today it brought back all of those memories I had when I was 11.
I cried, it's so wholesome.
Jesus I'm so fucking old
THE ULTIMATE "I spent a day with"
This is spectacular you two, but I think we all need a new question answered.   When is the Smosh 2 movie where you guys are in space fighting mutant trash aliens
If lunchtime with smosh doesn’t come back I might still be sad 😂
You guys drop 3 videos of you 2 together in the same day, and we're all going nuts for it 😂😵
i need a cliffnotes version DX
I live in Stockton. News10 is our Jen here. Always been kind of a cool little thing that I have in my back. That my two favorite dudes from Smosh are from my neck of the woods. Always think it was kind of funny that the cast go "that ghetto place Sacramento" like try Stockton out for a minute. Sacramento is weirder a bunch of us Stocktonights run off to.
A Collab i was waiting for so long on this channel!!! A Reunion😭😭
This is so raw and I am so sorry you had to go through that...
Oh my god you got the channel back?!  Good job guys!🎉😊
FINALLY
I hope you continue this series despite rejoining Smosh, it’s helped a lot of people
Smosh the movie was great because it had you guys in it and that’s what matters
I'm honestly just so happy about them having their friendship back. Still stoked that the Duo is back with owning Smosh, but their friendship is just so important. I've been watching since 2005/6 and it just makes me so happy to see them together again 💚
Have I time traveled back to 2012 😮
WE'RE SO FUCKING UUUUUUUP
i'm crying so much rn
4:46 some one should've told Xqc
This video made me fall in love with Ian.
matpat's gotta be sweating watching you buy your channel back right after he sold his
I hope you guys just stay friends and make content forever like Rhett and Link
if ian says "like" one more time i will rip my hair off
Nearly a 50 like ratio at 80k ish views. U guys made my childhood frfr man x❤
Who is Ian hecox
I like how you can see the youth in Ian spark up when they’re together
Today... Is a good day
Finally
You should do one with I Set My Friends on Fire
I'm so happy you guys got back together, because I missed the OG Smosh days with you guys.
I love this for you guys, and I can't wait to see what you all do. I also CANNOT WAIT for Food Battle 2023 or 2024. I've been missing those
YOOOO it's a Smosh reunion!!!!! 😃
3:53 is now a meme
I think she needs some Dixon Cider😘
surprised he didnt start the video with "SHUT UP" and the smosh intro
im screaming😊
Lunch time with Smos is one of the first Youtube series I can remember just BINGE watching like 15 years ago man time flys.
honestly waited for this since last year  so happy for you guys!!! 🥺
I feel that ratatouille gif (you know which one)
The ultimate I spent a day with!
This is legit a classic therapy session for smosh fans lol. 👏 Not complaining though this is amazing.
If Smosh ever made another movie, this would be the perfect story to tell. Ending with these fine gentlemen sitting down in these chairs knowing they finally own Smosh again.
You can see Ian go through this relaxation process through out the interview. I love it that they are connecting on such a deep level now
i literally thought like two days ago “why hasn’t he done an ISADW ian”
it feels like an old kpop group doing comeback. Its gonna be great..again.
holy shit
If you think about it, Charlie the guinea pig is a metaphor for Smosh 😭
Based and smoshpilled
Not even the Pussycat Dolls reunion was this powerful, and that was huge
Loved the vulnerabilities showed by these two legends. Glad that things worked out for the best and where you're all at now!
not me having to pause the video for 5 minutes to process the fact that Ian worked at a chuck e cheese... i am currently working at a chuck e cheese.
This the best thing to happen in 2023!
since when is ian the mature one
lol i was watching smosh when i just got on youtube which was like 2014/2015, i think my first video smosh video was the siri video
This hits hard for everyone who seen them from the beginning.
It’s fucking Christmas for me today
This is a historic moment
I met my bestfriend in 6th grade because of the of movies were real video and we were both heartbroken when Anthony left this morning both of us almost cried when we heard you got back together I’m sure this means a lot to you guys but it means just as much to all  of us ❤
I cant believe this is finally happening. Its been so long. Its crazy.
finally...this is so emotional...
let's FRICKINV GO.
Whaaatttt
This feels like when Shaq and Kobe sat down and reconnected
I spent a day with Ian's mom???
no way
This day feels like early christmas
ghetto smosh finally has compitition
ah yes, the two guys are back
Oh god the milk fanfic..... It was the first fanfic I had ever read. It made me avoid fanfics for quite a long time.
Meow 😺🐱🐱🐱🐱
This is so beautiful to see you two back in action together I am very excited to see what you two can pull off today! It’s such a nostalgia trip seeing you guys perform the Pokémon theme song man life can be crazy sometimes!
So glad to see you two together again and so great to see these old clips!   The two funny guys in TV & Radio Class sure went on to do great things 👏👏
smosh therapy
Who’s that?
Holy. Shit. I never thought I'd see a video like this ever. I have been a child of the internet for forever, Runescape on miniclip in 04, youtube in 06, mortal kombat theme song, chocolate rain, Double Rainbow, star wars kid. I witnessed the rise and fall of monoliths such as Shane Dawson, Shay Carl, Fred, Jenna Marbles, that goddamn Annoying Orange saga (however just "Annoying" is one of the most spectacular youtube segments to ever grace us). The perpetual legacy of cats like Philly D and yourself. Please always stay true to yourselves. It matters. Thanks.
I’m so happy you guys got Smosh back!! Can’t wait to see the new content!
WOOOOOO
❤🎉❤🎉
Roy and Alex are also back together ♥️
i could burst into tears im so happy to see this video
Excuse me who dressed Ian because 1. He looks incredible. 2. The color looks amazing on him ans 3. He looks like hes been hitting the gym. Glow up. Ian looks bomb.
I really hope Anthony makes his content too and not just drop it for smosh. I feel like it’s very important for him to do his content to represent people who are misunderstood.
You guys made my childhood. Now it's time to relive my nostalgia, of your old days together.
im just at 24mins and im already crying 😭
I first discovered smosh from one of their earlier videos called "cat soup" which at the time, was considered fresh comedy for the mid 2000s.  I continually watched smosh until i found out they were being bought out by another company and knew that they would fall off once they put their work into a new set of hands.  I knew that one day, the dynamic duo would make a huge comeback and buy their company back to revive millions of the fans that grew up watching them daily.
Letsgoooooo
Youtube history right here boys!
i need a lip reader to tell me who peed on the president's desk ASAP
i feel like im a kid again seeing these two together. im so glad they got SMOSH back
Anthony is very good at pulling Ian back to reality lol no wonder our poor emotionless boy felt like he was on an island. Yin and Yang vibes. Happy to see them reunited.
While I don't think the old type of videos will be coming back It's at least cool too hear Smosh is now in the hands of the people who started it- I still remember Smosh being like the first channel I consistently came back to and subscribed to, this was a great episode >w<
Great therapy session. The growth you both have had since 2017 can really be seen. Everything happened for reason, and now your relationship will be stronger than ever.
It brings tears to my eyes
They say as you grow up, you see a lot of what you love die, and smosh was one of those things for me  But hearing it may come back? That's a type of joy i can't express, not because of it coming back necessarily, but more because it is something i thought done and gone coming right back out of its grave to give it another shot, spinning the old wheel again for the good old times, this is one is really special, and i'll be so happy to see it, hoping it goes well.
I wasn't ready a month ago, but I'm ready now. I teared up. This is beautiful❤
54:32
True Love
First discovering the internet as a kid the first youtube channel I got into was Smosh. I just want to say thank you for all the memories you guys gave me throughout my childhood.
Dixon cider has lived in my head for years
God damn. Never thought I’d see them BOTH own Smosh again. My child self and I are currently jumping with joy.
this is beautiful
welcome back, to the both of you. damn I'm crying, I grew up watching the both of you😭😭
Bro I've always wanted this. This looks great
What a journey, 18 years in the making!
Nice
That hug at the start brought me back to the good bye hug at the end of the Anthony leaving Smosh video, and the Instagram post after. It was great to see the snap back.
So glad to hear you're getting back together. Cant wait to see the next where's Anthony in a skit hahahahaha
Do vanoss gaming next plsss ❤️❤️🔥🔥
1:11:34 I legit cried, and I think Anthony almost did too
So they are not actual friends? (sorry but i dont have the time to watch it all)
Cyber Space Celebrities
Ian had a glow up omg 😍😍
The world is truly healing, man...
What a day…
I started watching smosh when I was six and now I’m 20
Not to make y’all feel old but I’ve been watching smosh and the old videos since I was in elementary and I am now a sophomore in college🥹🫶
29:40 hell ya you piss on that desk.
Who is this?
i’m turning 18 in a month or two and seeing the channel that really shaped my childhood come back to what it was before is so emotional for me.  But i’m more happy that Ian and Anthony are reconnecting and building their friendship
I don't think this is an interview anymore, it's more like two friends just found each other again and talk about how their life was together
This brings back alot of childhood memories
I'm so so happy for you both!!!
I needed this
So weird, in an amazing way, to see smosh back together. Y'all were one of my first creative inspirations as a kid. Me and one of my bestfreinds would watch your content and eventually also tried to make, admittedly bad, youtube videos in inspiration. Years later, on the same day smosh was bought by you two we coincidentally met up since we were both in our home town. Seeing y'all as a kid, inspired me to want to get into arts even if its a little goofy. And while video making was not my calling I just finished my bachelors in english, something i never would have thought of if not seeing people like SMOSH creating while I was young.
This start of this video made me so happy. I love seeing my childhood back together after all this time. Thanks guys, for putting a huge smile on my face, and keep doing what you're doing <3.
When will you have Ian from smosh?
26 next month, this feels like a great early birthday present. I Loved Smosh so much.
glad to see its still there
Anthony just made me realize that content creators can have parasocial relationships with themselves... Love hearing you talk about things like this, makes me reconsider my childhood friendships that have since passed by.
OMG I’m screaming!!!!
I remember I wrote on your Myspace and begged you guys to write me "happy Birthday" I came home from school when i turned 16 to find a notification that *Smosh Wrote You A Comment* You guys wrote "Happy Birthday Broseph!!!" I just about lost my crap and was soo happy one of you took to time to write that. It was around the time of "That Damn Neighbor, Yard sale video" 2008 or so. Thanks Guys. ALways happy to see you guys doing well.
Ok, who put onions out
are you guys saving ghetto smosh aswell?
A blast from the past. I missed this guy so much.
My childhood🥹
I want a new Food Battle TOMORROW
Yes yes yes yes yes, I've been a fan since the start and now I'm 30. Smosh and Anthony's content saved me multiple times especially during covid.
You own smosh again?!
i am so happy you two are back reunited :,)
COLD ONES
WOW!
Finally
Man I haven't watched Smosh in years but this was such a hit of nostalgia seeing them together
It's nice seeing the channel back together. I look forward to seeing future content with you guys again. Smosh was a huge part of my childhood; of course not limited to just mine, and it was more than heartbreaking news to see you guys break up. It's just the same amount seeing it brought back. I'm much more than ecstatic to see this being brought back.
I’m so glad Anthony had an interview with young George Lucas
Can’t believe the people who owned youtube when it was born, finally owns their channel again
That's really good!!
is this real
I never thought this day would finally come! I don't expect it to be the same as it once was but I'm just glad to see Anthony and Ian back together again!
🐒
i found smosh as a middle schooler and have been rewatching old smosh videos for years now. this feels like a dream come true to see you two opening up about all of this after i've spent the last few months binge-rewatching lunchtime with smosh! <3 can't wait to see what the smosh channel has in store C:
😮😃👍
This is wild never again did i think i’d see them together.
YESS
Let’s fucking go
I love you guys so much
WHAT A W!!!
It comes full circle, thank you both so much for being amazing
You walked so people could run and people learned
ive been watching smosh since ian is bored this is insane im so happy for yall <3
Literally teared up. Used to watch Smosh way back when I was 8 and to see you guys back together now that I'm 24 is INSANE.
when are food battles coming back👀
This wasn’t just an interview. This was a whole therapy session that these two needed, and I’m so happy that we are able to hear their thoughts on their time together under Defy Media and their friendship.
No way they bought it back
Smosh was the best channel back then and i cant wait to see it become the best again.
For the reccord I bought the smosh movie with an iTunes giftcard I had gotten for christmas lol, It wasn't great but I liked the beginning song. Also! Ian should go ghost hunting with you and Mykie at some point!
I will become a member if you release FOOD BATTLE 2023
You guys are literally like the founding fathers of YouTube😭
These are two of the greats who inspired me (and definitely many others) to make their own videos, and also caused me to be addicted to YouTube! It's honestly so heartwarming to see them together again, like a happy ending to a movie.
Absolute legends
The most important guest tbh
YOU GOT THE CHANNEL BACK. FUUUUHHHHH
HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT
This is amazing, Smosh is literally my childhood 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was so happy for Anthony when he left smosh. Smosh died for me far before Anthony left, the soul was gone like a dead puppet. People in the crew started to look sleepless and all the energy was gone. I was so upset to see Ian stay honestly. I’m so glad it’s the two of you again.
Bro let’s…Fucking…GO
11 YEAR OLD ME IS BEAMING.
FOOD Battle 2023 lessssssssss goooooooooooooooooo
Legendary Duo
NO WAY! This is now my favourite episode 🎉🎉
I used to love Smosh when I was younger and now in my early 20s I occasionally rewatch a few of their videos and I still like them lol it's great knowing now what was really going behind the scenes and all these years later they're still two great looking guys!! lol I think if they restart Smosh it should 100% only be content they want and would really like to make lol Im equally excited to see ian as i am to see Anthony
The LEGENDS are back!!!
my childhood
If they dont bring back food wars I'd be dissapointed.
Best one I've seen yet
Naruto and Sasuke Individuals
AS A 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN, I HAVE GOOSE BUMPS THAT YOU BOTH OWN SMOSH AGAIN.
Super interesting conversation between 2 legends
We needed this
My heart 🥹❤️
WOAHHHHHHHH
Will Farrell and Mark Wahlberg?
How Many OGs Are Here?
Anthony and Ian are the definition of glow up goddamn
Monumental moment of YouTube
Dream comes true man stay love high GOOD MORNING guys i am Indian u gave me memories bros❤❤❤
o por dios                 o por dios
Love to see it
I was definitely one of those kids that shouldn’t have watched Smosh. Glad I did tho! I’m 21 now and I cannot explain how rent free those memories and references live. Happy cow, happy cow will never go away… iykyk 🥰
Dads❤
NGL, the part where they were talking about the videos Anthony started making right after he left Smosh and how they were cringey I completely disagree with… I thought right at the beginning before he just switched over to “Spent a day with” the sketches were absolutely hilarious 🤣 it felt like what Smosh used to be and I absolutely loved it! I was so excited every time he uploaded. I haven’t watched as much lately TBH
Im glad you two are talking again.  Smosh was one of my favorite things to watch way back in the day. I’ve been rewatching the old ones recently and I’m excited to see you work together on some more projects.
Bro I didn’t know Ian had swag
I'm crying. I've been waiting on this moment for years.
smosh the movie is a cinematic masterpiece ahead of its time
THANK YOU RHETT AND LIMK ❤
oh this is everything i could’ve ever asked for i’m crying
I never had the chance to express my gratitude for the humor and joy you guys brought to me when i needed it most. To see you two owning the company again and reforming a healthy best friendship is awe inspiring to see things come full circle. Thank you two for always being the friends I needed and I look forward to seeing the shenanigans you will have as the adults we all are. Here's 10 bucks because at least it'll buy a gallon of gas for you both directly from me to you. 😭
In my brain, this is like when Paul McCartney finally bought back the rights to The Beatles catalogue
Smosh was one of the first English channels I watched - helped me learn the language ❤
The boys are back baby!🎉🎉🎉
god this is so satisfying to see
It's moment like this that I know this is not the darkest timeline yet
This was seriously the greatest thing I could have ever seen, my childhood self feels healed and happy, thank you Ian and Anthony for keeping me happy in my youth
It’s weird seeing these two together again lol
YOU HAVE SMOSH BACKK????? NO WAYYYYY!!!!!!!!! HELL YEAHHHHH!!!!!!!!
You guys are going all out since the announcement. Can’t wait for next week glad to have you guys back
la conchad e la lora como que no estan los subtitulos abiertos porfavor haganlosssss
Omg
9:25 man I was one of those kids that LOVED yall, I was like 8 or 9 when I started watching, I'm 20 now man, just glad yall are finally back cause it felt like smosh was just on a downhill decline, hope that changes now and hopefully doesn't flop or lose hype fast, I don't want that for yall, but that's also on yall to make that pure good content that people will enjoy. I'm excited to see where this will go! SHUT UP
the rager story legit sounds like a smosh sketch LOL
It's insane that this is the 2nd of my childhood favorite youtube duos to reunite within the past like month. First Roi & Alex from Wassabi Productions make a new channel together, now this
am I crazy or does Ian looks like Ryan Reynolds?
I teared up when they showed those teen pictures and when Anthony was sharing deep emotion towards Ian. Glad they shared this with all of us ♥️
Return of the kings
The day has come!!!!
Man, we're just on a hype train aren't we lol
you guys have put all of us og fans in shock.. in a good way
My childhood
Always wanted a collab from the two of you 💛 never seen y’all together before.
Girls: do you boys even cry? Boys: “it’s a bad day for rain”
omgggg
I’ve never clicked a video so fast before 😅
DUDE 😭😭
I bet when MatPat saw that Ian working at Chuck E Cheese, his mind goes like; Urple GUYY
omg. i love this. we needed this.
I was so happy this morning, I can't describe it
My first YouTube channel I actually subscribed to back in what 2008 or 2009? Jeez.. 😢  I'm glad you guys have come back to each other like soulmates.
How is there not more people watching this, its honestly one of my top 5 channels to watch.  We need to help spread the word 💯
Finally the Iconic duo meet again.....
Oh my god, I clicked so fast
Smosh is back. NEVER THOUGHT THAT WOULD HAPPEN NO IT SEEMS OBVIOUS...
❤
Seeing Ian and Anthony together again and in SMOSH is like a fever dream, you guys really made my childhood on the internet, cheers to you two restarting SMOSH
No matter what direction you take, solo or with smosh, you’re AWESOME Anthony. It shows that you care so much.
This feels so nostalgic😊
Will the return of smosh summer games be next?! I hope so!
This entire video is a moment that’ll go down in history
Anyone else think they’re gonna see the sub count skyrocket?
Crazy thing for me is that I was exactly the right age to be a huge fan on Smosh, but never really got into it. I had friends share the videos with me, but the comedy never really clicked for me. It kinda just existed as this big thing people would talk about in the background of my life. As soon as I found you doing your own thing, I became a fan. I've grown to enjoy a lot of the newer Smosh stuff too, so I'm actually really excited to see where this goes with the years of individual experience added to it
As I grew up I stopped watching smosh. Strikes me as weird to see those funny teenagers as full grown adults ... god, such good memories
So happy to see you guys together again 🫶🏾
At the 9 min mark I'm reminded of the line hashed by Shane: "We're trying to make giggles for 8 year olds..."
This is my childhood
wow.... part of my childhood has been restored. sobbing😢
I am so happy that Anthony and Ian have smosh back and that they can now do their own skits and not deal with corporate stuff anymore. Also Anthony is back in the videos again
Omg
11:38  Now that is the Youtube humor that I miss
This was something I didn't know I needed. I have such a big smile of my face.
12:07 you can see Anthony’s eyes moving and reliving those exact memories
Please bring back the great Food Battles!
OMG I’m dreaming 😢😢😢❤❤❤
I’m going to watch the old Smosh Games videos after 6 years they are finally back together again 😢🥳🙂😀😇😅
ok, i'm about to cry
the collab none of us deserved, but all of us needed. keep going guys, youre both talented on your own and when you come together you make something thats truly unique.
This was so therapeutic to listen to you guys hash this shit out
holy hell, i’ve been having a rough month after a really sad breakup and this put a smile on my face thank you
Wtf u guys bought smosh again?!?!?’ Are u gonna be making videos together again?!?
Ngl. Hearing them both talk about how bad the company themselves were, really gives me hope for the future. They knew how bad things got. It must of been awful to work for them and I'm glad they managed to get out from it. Welcome back Smosh!
Off topic but both of u have great hair
the nostalgia just came racing in
The true pioneers of YouTube. Missed you guys together
the band is getting back together again :D
UR JOE KING
That hug was 100% Smosh nostalgia
Pleasant surprise, and very welcome old friend
Why is ian hotter than anthony now?
Dad Ian got custody of me in the divorce when I was still so young, I'm thirty now and my dads are back together, I'm healed.
Holy shit!?
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wasn't a fan of smosh when they first started. I always knew of them, but I didnt start watching either of them until after the split
Conversations like these should be common with people. Professional, mature, respectful, there's classic Smosh , there's new Smosh, and then there's two bros chilling on long chairs, 5 feet apart cuz they're both awesome
Do we get a food battle again then?
My memories
I spent a day with IAN HECOX ❌️  I will spend the rest of my life with IAN HECOX ✔️
childhood reunion vibes holy shit. today is my bday so this is more then i couldve asked for, thx for the memories guys, yall do some great shit :3
Anthony: see I don't need you to answer questions. I was there
I’m so excited to see you guys back again, you both were my childhood. I watched to much of Smosh as a kid, so seeing you guys after all this time back together is great!
So excited for this
2023 already becoming the best year ever
mind blownned this is happening!
you two are the true kings of youtube in my eyes~
The first shot of them together made my heart drop
I felt like I was let into a therapy session between you two. Thank you both for being so open and honest about your struggles with your friendship, and letting us in on what’s been happening behind the scenes. To keep up an image of an unbreakable friendship must have been hard to maintain on such a global scale. I’m so happy you both were able to revisit such an important part of your lives and to mend the broken parts! I love you both so much and I can’t wait to see what’s in store for the future. 🥹💕
OMG ITS HAPPENING
Love to see you together again! ❤ I know you probably never stopped being friends but it seemed like you had gone apart completely
Shout out to Ian and Anthony's 6th grade science teacher for pairing them together!! ❤
41:48 you're gonna cry anthony? im already balling man. healthy reconnection ftw.
I haven't seen this yet, but YEEEEEEEES. You have no idea what this means to me. I found you both in my teens, i remember watching you a ton at uni, and the dyamic between you two and what you built together stands the test of time!
The collab we didn’t deserve but got.
IM SHOOCKED
this conversation is so enlighting, people can learn from you guys, the trials and tribulations of friendships.
Oh MY god can you imagine how much unopened fan mail for smosh there is?! The mail time videos were my favorite esp. With Charlie the Guinnea pig cameos. I'm so excited to see you guys together again I gotta say opening up youtube today to see the announcement had me checking the date to be sure ❤
Finally, the world can start healing
It’s a blessing to see an hour of this duo just being real
Its nice to know they never stops being friends
SHUT UP
Ian’s mom collab? Maybe a food battle royale with the whole office/cast?
Kinda forgot Anthony was apart of smosh when this started
Lunchtime with Smosh when?!
Maaaaaan this was my childhood i remember seeing Ians bread haircut and Anthony's emo look every day when i went on youtube. Love robot,  draw the thing, deathnote, magical keyboard videos were the shit. I love seeing u guys back together u brought so much joy to me and so many others and from the bottom of our heart THANK YOU! ❤
my childhood has come back and im in so much joy and shock,, food wars when?
Classic Smosh over ANY other youtube videos
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I think this might be one of the only times in a long time where ive watched a video before it was released for a full hour
no matter what you think of them, THE pioneers. not up for debate
We are back to the podcast channel😂😂😂😂
dope
51:35 lmaooo would be a funny skit
this is like a fever dream
It’s amazing that I was 10-11 and now I’m almost 24 and they’re getting back together
FINALLY ! ❤
so you guys gonna bring back the old smosh games crew? even for some cameos. also please do smosh and order again.
It's heartwarming to see you together again! Smosh is the best with you both!
這集有一個小時！
Glad you guys got together again before it was to late
The most iconic internet duo is back
Anthony finally brought his hot friend on the show!
When I was a university student, I wrote 10 pages of essay about Smosh in Mass Media Class. On page 7, I wrote a theory that one day old smosh might come back, and now it became real. I'm happy to be part of a smosh family of fans to support their channel nonstop.🎉🎉🎉🎉
YES
Im glad you guys are back together making content with one another again. It sucks when a company has control over how you make and release content, its like they wanted to milk the content dry and sap all of yalls passion for it.  It feels like the online world has healed a good bit.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER OMG!!!!!
Anthony’s laugh at 51:45 is so precious 😭
I can’t wait to see what’s in store, especially with all the new cast members
J'ai grandis avec eux découvert YouTube avec eux Ian & Anthonny Smosh les piluliers de Youtube❤
OH MY GOD
Now that they own Smosh, any chance of reuniting with the ogsog crew and bringing back Smosh Games.
been watching smosh since 2011 and i’ve been waiting for the reunion for years! i love this
bro hearing y’all bought smash again just made my whole mf day
OMFG
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS❤
No way. I found Smosh at 7, my parents banned me from watching it because you swore, LMAO
Wow shit is going down
NOT ME SEEING AND I GOTTA SLEEP OMG BUT ANYWAY IM SO HAPPY IMA DREAM OF THIS THEN WATCH WHEN I GET OFF WORK
I feel like interrupting something from this convo . Like if I shouldn’t be here and watch such a raw convo about such deep topic that affected you both. Its really humanizing in a way see this kind of convo happen outside my own experiences though
It’s happening!!!!
necesito este video subtitulado al español :(
My childhood is reignited!!!
Dreams do come true
Today humanity begins to heal 😌
F*** they're both so hot
no way. no way
Historic
I have to say, from my perspective, Ian basically un-sunk the Titanic. He grew a lot when Defy media went defunct and his passion for keeping Smosh alive is what kept it alive. That entire ordeal and watching everything around it was hugely inspiring. Rhett and Link were superb for giving Smosh a chance, with confidence for sure, and are the best for agreeing to sell it back all these years later with grace. Ian is a truly capable leader and the entirety of the Smosh crew really brought their A game to get Smosh through a very turbulent time and flourish to boot.  Edit: Refined and added needed praise.
What a happy day! And there is already 3 videos of them together! This is going to be great!
Bro if this means we will get another food war I’ll die happily
This shit crazy
gotta love seeing how much they have both matured and understand the importance of communication. I always wondered how rhett and link were able to do it, and i think it comes down to maturity and communication. I hope we get to see the rebondification of SMOSH
after when rhett and link bought smosh, they moved smosh to another building, then they sold it back to ian and anthony. i think shaynes screaming constantly had something to do with it. now i think rhett and link are finally getting some peace and quiet and theres no calls about pizza places or a trash wizard wandering around anymore.
The way I clicked on this so fast
Oh no! I made your Link and Assassins Creed costumes! Im happy to make them again ❤
I CAN'T BELIVE THEY ARE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. SMOSH 4 EVER
I'm so happy you guys are back! Ya'll were a BIG part of my childhood!!!
I’ve been telling my friends that I wanted to see this video happen for years and the dream has finally come true 😭❤️
Literally Mordecai and Rigby
Trying not to cry. Never thought I would see this moment happen.
not all the way finished w the video but wanted to just mention that I loved the smosh movie😭 idk if this was an unpopular opinion but it’s still nostalgic for me HAHAHA
I’m so happy that they finally managed to get Smosh back
I had the old smosh shirt from Hot Topic,  I want to say a 2010 freshmen year.
Ian really grew up  Edit; HOLY SHIT THEY BROUGHT SMOSH
Where’s Anthony???
OMG!!! THE INTERNET IS FINALLY FIXED
b
Anthony looks like he became the lead singer of a band. While Ian looks like he became a dad of twin girls, working as a CPA.
Legit feels like im sitting in on a couples therapy session but its beautiful
Respect.
Waiting for this forever
DUDEEEEE
YES
I'm putting this on my 55 inch flat-screen right now
I loved this so much . I grew up with y’all  from middle school to high school. I shed a tear in this one
OH MY GOD
this is such a good showcase of both of you, and how you dealt with stuff.  gotta show out ian for holding down the fort though,
im learning so many things I didn't know before. this is awesome.
In 2017 I had a make a wish meeting smosh and I’m so happy you guys are back I will cherish everything you guys did for 12 years old me and will forever owe you both and all the other great people that hung out and made me feel like I was a part of the group. Thank you Smosh I am forever in debt
i love u guys but now that u bought smosh are u still going to post on here?
LIFE IS WHOLE AGAIN
oh my God i was one of those 10 year olds lmao
I’m sooooo happy!!! Friendship always wins (insert picture of Ian and Anthony jumping in the air).
When Food Battles come back... I'm gonna cry so hard.
Fuck me dude. Man.
OMG I AM ALREADY SOBBING
man this is amazing
EVERYONE MOVED
FINALLY!  Miss you guys
“SHUTUP”
I love how you can see Ian and Anthony have matured over the years. I'm so happy to see you guys back and thank you for being transparent with this whole Smosh journey.
holly crap gotta get me some weed to watch this, brb
I'll be honest. I completely stopped watching Smosh since Anthony's departure. I was sad because I knew it wasn't going to be same anymore. I never thought I'd see the day that Anthony and Ian would be in the same video again. This literally made my morning.   Congratulations for owning Smosh again, you two!  Congratulations for having your baby back, Anthony!
The fact that I watched a “where’s Anthony” compilation earlier today and then this happens
Dude smosh is older than I am and I'm still so ecstatic and nostalgic seeing them together again
when I saw the Smosh announcement, I knew to come straight here.
this made and will make all my days 😭😭😭
I think we all dreamed of this video lol
I literally gasped so loud when I saw the thumbnail I'm SO EXCITED. My childhood is literally back thanks to this
Food Battle 2023?
RETURN OF THE KINGS
Almost at the end of this rollercoaster.. excited for the future.
*GASP* the creators of my childhood in a room together again???
I've been watching yall since 2005❤️ I'm 25 now and i can't wait to see where this goes!! This made my heart so so happy!!
Wait holy shit anthonys back on smosh?!
can someone count how many times they both say “like”
the noise that just came out of me when I saw this.
For realsies though, Defy going under and Smosh's recovery would make a beautiful film
we need a full watch of the movie from you guys reacting
Sooooooo Lunchtime with Smosh coming back? 👀👀👀👀
Jesus, finally
This feels like a dream
Omg!! they got back, smosh. I miss them making video's together. The legendary team is of Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla  once again.
my soul is healed seeing them together again
And we're back!!!!!
I can’t stop smiling
THE BOIS ARE BACK LESGOOOOOOO
Pokemon in Real Life was the very first video I watched on Youtube, and Smosh became the core of my entire internet experience growing up. I never thought I'd see the day that Ian and Anthony reunited and made Smosh whole again.
first wassabi productions and now you guys? OMG the world is healing!
This is so beautiful ❤
Hey Anthony Latam need know about this news and we need Patrick's voice in the videos pleaseeee
It’s honestly disheartening hearing Dan Howell, Smosh, and other YTers who had to deal with creative burnout from companies. Artists can never just create and it makes me sad thinking about it
Lol 49 minutes ago
Damn, didnt recognize that this is the guy who survived on the beach (RIP Jamal, crack is whack bitch)
holy fucking shit
Crying rn this is so cool
Holy shit
That hug at the start was so great to see, you guys owning Smosh again makes my middle school self so happy! Can’t wait to see what you guys do with it!
This is amazing 🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻
Damn... I love they're as cringe as my childhood. Now that they're adults, they're still the same kids at heart.
OMG you guys are my childhood with elsmosh. And now so happy to see you guys together once again.💎
I got more emotional than normal watching this. I hope you know Anthony how much you and Ian had meant the world to me through my childhood and how I saw life with such grace, positivity, and fun cause of Smosh. Genuinely, thank you guys for everything 💙
the most goated duo
YAAAAS KINGS OF EMOTIONAL MATURITY 😭😭😭
YESS! Omg, you guys are my childhood, I'm so glad you got the company back!!!
29:31 it's really how anthony is like oh yah so all hell broke loose and riots happened right? and then ian proceeds to describe how all the employees at the time turned the defy corporate office into a hellscape of rage 😅hope everyone got their well deserved catharsis bc damn it sounds like the shutdown was utterly chaotic in every way--huge props to rhett and link for coming through with mythical!!
HOLY SHIT
YOOOOOOOIO
More than Smosh returning, I’m invested in your friendship strengthening.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO!!!!
But why did y'all have to bring up the milk fic!!! 😖
woah
whoaaaa…as a 27yo now who grew up on the internet & is still v much part of it, this is an amazing unexpected episode. glad to hear you two own SMOSH in its entirety again, that you’re still not only in touch but coming back together after virality & life at that level (understandably) swept y’all up and away. very cool seeing how you’ve individually grown and continued to adapt & succeed as part of the FIRST youtube OGs. it’s getting very parasocial up in here but idc i’m happy to see things going well for you guys 🎉❤
"This was exactly the way, right now, that things were meant to happen." - The Narrator (The Stanley Parable 2011)
They’re back!
Are you going to continue making this series??
I saw the GMM tweet earlier today. Absolutely crazy the time we live in to see Smosh back with you and Ian.
I was literally just thinking about this happening, and assumed it never would. Then it was uploaded 😭
SMOSH BACK IAN AND ANTHONY IS BACK AND THIS IS THE BEST LONGEST FRIENDSHIP VIDEO I EVER WATCH YOU GUYS ARE MY CHILDHOOD 😭😭😭
Perfection.
Let’s GOOO!!
LEZZZZGAWWWWW!!!
This is surreal and what everyone was waiting for.   After 6 long years, two friends finally reunited and back together again!  Great to see you two together again!
I'm not a Smosh fan because I grew up under a rock, but I enjoy Anthony's interviews so I clicked this video. This wholesome, honest, raw interaction between two friends discussing their feelings is AMAZING ❤❤ Definitely going to go watch some of their old stuff!
F**k you Defy Media!
Food Battle 2023 confirmed?
Wow
This is now the best day of my life.
This is history
Been waiting for this interview.     ***Update:  Consider me re-subscribed to SMOSH. :)
YOOOOO! I am back for the 1st time since it all began in 2006. Last time I watched a video of you guys, had to be 2012 or before. Without the duo, I refused to watch 😅Not really, I just never enjoyed the content without both of you. Here is to a new era of you two 😊Congratulations on the things to come!
Bro, my heart HEAL when you said " we Own SMOSH "
To celebrate ian has to go back to the bowl cut
whos this "ian hecocks" guy?
Who's this Ian guy
weirdly enough lunchtime with smosh was my favourite channel
I've been praying for times like this
Ian just seems so happy and energized again
legendary.
youtubes dads are back together
Smosh Babies™️ was more influential on the new age than the Bible. God bless Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla.
True friends always come back P.s. This video is giving me family therapy vibes 😂
I figured this video was inevitable, ESPECIALLY since it was announced Smosh was bought by these two.
I loved smosh back then
Oh, I think you've spent more than just A DAY with Ian.
Whoa!!! No way.
Love this!!!
I need to meet yall at orlando megacon!
What are good friends,for? Anthony firing up his channel, for Ian! Just, wow!
my life is so full
i really hope they bring back the summer/winter games. I loved those so much, it was such a shame to see them end. heres to hoping!
First Vsauce and now Ian?? Pewdiepie is next right?
Smash went from "shut up" to "hey, let's open up"
Anyone else expect this to happen?? Lmao
There's a comment that says "the collab everyone's been dying for" and all I thought was covid and all of 2022😂💀 like it's been gone longer than that (Smosh) but it feels like the major events in life made it 10× as long as it should've been.
Day two asking to interview the Amoeba sisters on YouTube
I'm loving this age of honesty that is being lead. It makes me feel happy to watch their content knowing that they truly enjoy what they do.
ok guys hear me out on ian
It's finally happened. They better talk about the muppet videos. Them shits slapped
cool
What the hell kind of inception is this?
Please tell me you two are going to be on @coldones
When I said ur arms were “disgustingly hairy” I didn’t mean gross and hairy I meant it like SUPER hairy. I’m sorry
First of the foremost: 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Second of the foremost: 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 Third of the foremost: this video was very insightful because when I was immature and angsty, I was shocked and disappointed and slightly pissy when Anthony left and you could see the distance between the two of them. This video is the closure that they and us the audience have been waiting for and what THEY as friends needed. I hope it gets less awkward and more naturally open with them as well. Fouth of the foremost:  This needs to be on a VHS tape and labeled a documentary 😂
2 grown men talking about their feelings, literally feels weird
I knew it lol
Incredible episode. Everything is coming together in a new era. I hope it lasts. I hope you guys have fun. I missed you both. <3
I'm expecting a new rendition of the Pokemon song.. please!!!
The absolute explosion of Smosh Content today! I'm so happy
I literally SCREAMED when I saw this upload 😭
36 mins ago, within the hour gang! 🫡
The world is healing
HISTORY
2023 just got better ❤
OMG
IVE BEEN DYING FOR THIS COLLAB
Almost on the brink of tears I've been waiting for this day!
OMG URYAYDUSUDUE
This is going to make me cry. The old videos from smosh are hard to top.. FOOD BATTLE… POKÉMON IN REAL LIFE… wow the nostalgia
Honestly happy this came out❤ didn't know if you guys would ever even be together in a video again!
I WAITED FOR THIS VIDEO FOR SO LONG
here before 100k views
I might cry congratulations guys 🥹🙏🏻
Spend a day with Ians mom.
This was pretty unexpected but its great to see Smosh back together.  Real OGs. Congrats!
Marvel: "Avengers: Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover in history."  Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox:  "Hold our beers."
I first read that as hexcox
THE GOATS ARE BACK!!!!
wow- glad yall got to clear the air with each other and have this open conversation. excited for the next step for smosh!
The I spent a day with video we needed the most
The canon event has arrived
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS !!!! Edit: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN ANTHONY AND IAN HAVE A MILK FIC I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST CURSED PANIC AT THE DISCO SHIT,,,,,,,,,, OH NO
My childhood is back and I thought it would never return
We are in the good timeline yall
Charlie the drunk guinea pig
My childhood mannn🥹 I’m 21 now n can’t wait to see what these two will do as I sit at home smokin weed n enjoy🥹
i love you guys so much!! you inspired me to get into sketch comedy many many many years ago which  evolved into me being able to make a living off of my own videos, thank you sooo much for inspiring me to pick up a camera and make things, i am forever grateful and SO GLAD that you're back together!!!!
Our dads are back together ❤️
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY FOR EONS! THANK YOU JESUS!
Man.. What a day.
My inner child is now screaming with joy😢😢😢
My childhood (':
The tea is spilling
Oooh I’m getting a dopamine rush with the news of you guys both owning Smosh again and I’m getting excitement from this episode.
My brother and i both loved smosh growing up. I was too young to watch the channel but i still found the videos funny, despite not understanding most jokes that were too mature for me
Smosh being back aside, it's extremely refreshing to know that Anthony and Ian are chill still. It is very easy for a relationship like that to be irreparably damage, but they somehow turned it around and their friendship aged like a fine wine, which is a story I don't think gets to be told often enough.
What a journey
Smosh the movie was my first movie I bought on digital. Still love it
These two get a long really well I should write a stupid comment where I suggest they start a YouTube channel together or sum shit
Congratulations 🎉
This is the one I’ve been waiting for
i miss seeing ian and anthony in the same video again
The multiverse is restored
Does this mean... 2023 food wars?
This feels surreal
FOOD BATTLE 2023?!?!?!?!
My childhood
i’ve had the best day binging all this new-old smosh content
I will never get over the Dixon cider video 😂😂
You just turned us back in time 14-15 years ago. SO refreshing to see you together after so long!
I Miss having Lunch Time With Smosh, I loved having lunch with you guys! Also i wonder when Ian will be board with fan mail.
The boys are back
There’s nothing better than watching long time besties have a long conversation together
Let's make it, "I spent over an hour with (old buddy) IAN"
Smoshkino back in the menu
Top 10 moments in modern history
Literally everyones childhood right here! Thankyou so much you two very nostalgic video
The world is healing
I'm 32 and started watching Smosh when we just had horrible dial up at home when I was in high school... This brings a tear to my eye.
From 4 dollars to millionaires
omg they’re so good as a duo they should consider making a youtube channel together
wow. the two people who i watched as a kid even tho i am a teenager ..? lol
Is it just me or would a smash podcast be amazing? I am loving this!!
Yes they do!😭 I love you guuuyss!💝✨
Finally
this hit home <3
Its happening
SHUT UP!
Smosh is back together. The world is finally healing
Who else noticed this is one of the biggest developments in online media this year?
This is so insane I've literally never cried more
WOW DIDNT EXPECT THIS
I absolutely love how like this isn't an interview, this is like a nostalgia walk for the both of them 🥹  I'm 21 this year and I felt like I'm 13 again
YESSSSSSS
Spend a day with just a normal person.
Yess finally!!!! It’s about time
THANK YOU DOE MAKING THIS WPISODE SO LONG!!! I love that it’s much more conversational and just you two talking. It might’ve felt weird if you interviewed him like other ppl bc you’re not strangers
The reunion we have always wanted to see
What an interesting day.
The first online purchases I ever made were for Smosh merch ❤️ I would quote videos every day for all of high school. I'm so happy today!!
Still remember my first 4 channels I subscribed to. Smosh, Pewdiepie, equals 3, and epic meal time. Back when times were simple.
I can't wait for new Smosh you guys got so much stuff to make fun of on the Internet now I wanna see new food battle
Thanks
I remember waiting for an episode of lunchtime with smosh and when Anthony cut his emo haircut in that Christmas special I believe. Good times back then
You're gonna make me cry guys, ive been watching you for as long as i can remember, it broke my heart when anthony left and im so glad to see my food battle , hacker button, scribblenuats unlimited in real life, boys to finally come back home. We missed you :')
The therapy session they both needed and the therapy session we as fans also needed 😌👌
Finally I can die happy
Can i just say i havnt seen a pic of Ian in years and he looks great ! Good for him !
omg the collab we all wanted needed and got
wait… so you got smosh back? jesus this is like a dream come true.
hell yeah, me and my sister found smosh early on (we were def too young to be watching the shit LOL) and we LOVED everything...this makes my heart too happy to see you two connecting together again. thank you Ian and Anthony, you guys rock
It’s like two long lost siblings seeing each other after being apart for years :’).
I was in 3rd grade I think when I first started watching Smosh. I’m now 20 years old and it feels surreal to see you guys back together. Excited to see what you guys are gonna do now that Smosh is back!
i love this
for being the most requested interview it sure as hell didnt get a lot of views.
the 2014 smosh tumblr fandom is shitting bricks for this video!!!!
Can you guys eat lunch and find some twitter questions?
That was one hell of ride just for this moment.
SMOSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
😮 the oldest men I've ever seen
It is so interesting to hear that Ian was the possitive one back in the day. Because if you've kept up with Smosh, all the other crew members kinda always keep mentioning that Ian is a "negative Nelly". So maybe in a way, his possitivity went away when Anthony left and that kinda changed him. It is so sad. I am so glad they have kept up their relationship and now more than ever THEY ARE BACK TOGETHER.
Everybody waiting to see this.
It’s like watching my parents get back together
This is a historic day. It’s insane this is happening and I am stoked to see what happens next.  I also want to add that Ian looked so animated and happy during the TNTL episode posted earlier today.
IM SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS
YouTube ain’t ready for the resurgence I cannot wait for all of the collaborations y’all 😌
ONE WORD: chemisrty
The boys are back in town!!
Im crying😭
What a grand finale of this series. It has been wild ride Anthony. Hope to see your funny side again on the other channel!!
Hello
Really relatable with things they went through 😅
AH! I am so happy! Also ian looks so good here
Took him 6 years for this video, better late than never
wow i can't believe anthony and ian met for the first time they have good chemistry they should make a youtube channel together
crazy how ian looks no different than some nerdy classmate at a college
Its so crazy how much of their own personalities these two have become
Together again. Wow.
I very much was one of the 9 year olds that watched the Smosh movie and enjoyed it.
I always assumed that you guys were still friends, but that you didn't hang out or talk much due to just living your own separate lives. Like normal adults. So glad things have healed. ❤
Seeing two friends come back together to create together is so wonderful 🥹
Smosh definitely helped to develop my own sense of humor
It's enough to make a grown man cry
woah.
IM CRY YES YAYAYAYA
i am actually crying my eyes out😭
This is not a drill!!!
DOES THIS MEAN THE SMOSH MOVIE 2?!?!
I saw this thinking it would be great if they would have both ian and anthony on not realising it was on anthonys channel
i remember watching smosh when i first joined YouTube! some of the first content i've watched was your guys content. super happy to see you guys back as co-owners of smosh and im stoked to see what you'll do with the company!
I smiled at the thumbnail more than my firstborn child
Congratulations on getting smosh back together after so many years! Can’t wait to see what is next :D
Could not be happier!
Very happy that this and ghetto smosh will be at the same time right guys??
One of the first videos I ever watched on Youtube was the Smosh Pokemon theme back in 2005. I am overwhelmed with emotion.
FINALLY ❤❤❤❤
Thanks for bringing back my childhood (collegehood) so gracefully =)
Now we need the universe to help Jenna Marbles come back.
i grew up with them and now there back
I loved the call back to anthony's old vlog channel ❤
Can we get a lunchtime with smosh or nah??
What a great day for the internet
The heart and soul of smosh reunited
Old dudes back in black.
Finally yay
What an absolutely amazing video Ian and Anthony essentially hashing things out at 23:00 is so cool to just be a viewer of, speaking through things like adults; like friends. I never really watched Smosh but I'm excited to see what's next for the both of you.
This is SURREAL. Hope everything pans out exactly how you both hope! I’ll be along for the ride regardless. I’ve loved every phase of smosh
I Thot I was hallucinating. Never thought this video would happen. 30 minutes since post? Unreal AND MESNT TO BE, YouTube is trash these days and my first YouTube video EVER WAYCHED WAS FUCKING SMOSH TWILIGJT NEW MOON PARODY. that video was nastyyy and I was 8 lol
I am SO thankful that you guys are together again.  I feel like I grew up on this and am SO happy for both of you.  the memories will last a lifetime for me. :D
How many of us are watching the video and going through comments at the same time. So glad you guys are back ❤
NO WAY
this is sincerely mindblowing;  i remember when the very first mortal kombat video came out far before smosh as a brand was a thing, i remember when yall broke up, and now yall own it again?
Ian is dressed so freaking well. Go ahead baby!!!
I thought I was dreaming when I saw this- 🥹 holy crap. Watching the full thing RIGHT NOW
Omg now I see the foreshadowing in smosh sketches lile when Ian becomes 2012 Ian 🤣🤣 holy shit that's some long game meta
It's like watching my divorced parents get together
I never watched Smosh as a kid, but having been subscribed to Anthony for the past few years I am so happy that his and Ian’s channel is rightfully theirs again. I’ll subscribe and I cannot wait for what you two have in store for us.
w
What about Shut up! Cartoons
OUUUU
I didnt ever think I’d see smosh come back after so long I’m so stoked to see this!!!!!!!!!
I enjoyed the movie.
does this mean lunch time with smosh will come back?
30 mins in - this is such an interesting conversation so far. it’s so great to hear both of your guys’ thoughts and perspectives on everything that went down.
Hey they found anthony
Im just so happy
What multiverse did I wake up in!?  I see this as an absolute win!
I'm still in shock and emotional at the same time. I hope you guys continue to grow your creativity and share it with all of us. A true inspiration to all content creators watching. Welcome back to SMOSH Anthony! We truly missed you indeed. Even though you haven't left really.
Years ago I just discovered how youtube works, then I got the news that Smosh hit a Million Subscribers!!!! That was so wild how time pass so fast✨
As someone who's watched Smosh since 2011, I'm very excited to see how this new chapter of Smosh unfolds! LETS GOOO!!
OH. MY. GOD
I’m not crying y’all are🥹💛 but seriously this was so healing to watch ty for taking the time to sit down in front of your audience it means a lot.
OMG
This is what I needed! This is what I have been missing from my life! Anthony and Ian together creating content ❤ super excited for what’s to come!
Someone slap me I think I'm dreaming.
Watching these lads as a kid and copying their videos and talking about it with mates and also recently turning 20 nostalgia is high rn
Watching Smosh as a kid was like having two really funny older brothers making completely inappropriate jokes around you.
Can we also just talk about the glow-ups here? Slay guys
Biggest collaboration on YouTube right here
This was one piece of the childhood circle the only piece left is the return of NigaHiga
Also thank you Ian for sticking with Smosh 🥹
For many years, the only video in my watch later list was an episode of mail time that I accidentally added. Everyday I would see that thumbnail of Anthony’s scrunched up face. All these years later I am almost thirty and have left smosh behind but continued to watch Anthony’s content because it vibes with me much more now. With that said, I resubscribed to Smosh. I look forward to seeing the new sketches! There aren’t many YouTubers I’ve spent more of my time with than these two and I’m so happy that you both got your baby back. I hope you are able to once again find joy in it!
🥲
aw
Smosh is one of the reasons I wanted to be a content creator back in 2012. Finally made it in 2023. Thanks fellas for all the laughs and creative inspiration over the years, excited for the next phase!
Dude ive been watching smosh for 11 years its so good to see you back together
Then they drop the bombshell that Smosh is back under their control
Wild that Smosh is now entering Era 4
This is more interesting than any podcast I've heard. A snippet of internet history told by the internet history makers themselves. Thanks for making this!!
I was legit asking myself if he had any video with Ian on his channel just yesterday. I ain't subscribed so I only check once in a while. the timing was perfect.
This is so awesome
My mom was the one who introduced me to youtube, with the techno chicken video. I have watched so much youtube since like, god 2011
FINALLY
The reacquisition of SMOSH by Ian and Anthony is the start of the YouTube renaissance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bring back Box Man as an action hero!
I'm gonna cry watching this.... remember being a teenager and looking up to u guys :')
Holy
crying
My fckng heart
ZAMN
I'm so glad you folks got Smosh back. Looking forward to it - I miss the old videos you two made wayy back in the day. :D  Edit: Wow I've just realized that I first watched you guys over 13 years ago. That's insane. Time flies.
AHHHH I LOVE THIIIISSSS 😩😩😩😩♥️
Shit, I remember discovering Smosh back in like 2007/2008 and eagerly awaiting each weekly episode. My family had some sloooooow satellite Internet that required me to buffer and load the entire video so I could play it all in one go without interruptions. Literally, 10 minute videos would take at least 20-30 minutes to load, and as long as an hour if the connection was being messed up by the weather. Needless to say, the set up to watch these videos was quite the ordeal but made each video that much more enjoyable. Life was simpler when I was an 8th grader.
Smosh has been dead for Years
I can feel the middle school child in me healing already ❤️
Is this what it felt like when Jesus came back to life?
I'm so excited for you guys
Soo much in one day! I'm so glad that they didn't get separated. Even past working together and owning a business together, they are true friends
😢😢😢😭😭😭
MY DADS ARE BACK AGAIN IM SCREAMING
It's here :o
Anthony looks like Tony Stark in the second movie when he realizes his artificial heart is killing him
It makes me so happy that after all this years, Anthony Padilla and that Ian Hecox guy have finally met!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEES FINALY OH MY GOD
This is incredible, it almost feels like a series finale, the ultimate guest Anthony Padilla could possibly have So glad to see them together again
steve youtube was the greatest character in movie history. i remember watching the movie when i was like 14 and absolutely loved it. the haircut bit was the first joke to make me belly laugh
They both look and dress gay
this is so surreal
I ♥️ new smosh
I’ve literally spent my whole entire day going back-and-forth between all the channels and your channel just soaking in the nostalgic feeling of you guys being back together I’m literally crying😭❤️
10:00 is so interesting to me because there a lot of kids who watched smosh who still do to this day. I am one of them — started watching smosh at 10 and I’m now a 20 year old adult. It’s so fascinating whenever creators grow up with their audiences
The reality of Ian and Anthony buying Smosh back and essentially reuniting is SUPER crazy to think about now, in 2023, where a lot of the people who grew up watching Smosh, and essentially have been watching a bunch of different people's content on YouTube for almost two decades, are in their teens or are adults and are witnessing their childhood coming back in a different landscape from 10 years ago! I'm so hyped to see more of what Smosh has in store now and what Ian and Anthony will get involved with and be up to now that they are back in business!
You have no idea how happy this makes me, I still remember when my friend introduced me to Smosh in like 8th grade, I still remember a lot of the skits and og songs. My internal kid is hyped
This interview plus the wendigoon iceberg makes a great day
Ayyy they got it back!
my favorite part is when ian goes, "MMMMMM." like Anthony does every episode. LOL
I'm so happy you guys got together once again.   I'm so grateful for the original Smosh, not only because it was a great part of my childhood, but I believe it is one of the biggest reasons I had an interest of learning English to begin with, and that has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life.  Thanks for all, and congrats on buying Smosh!
The nostalgia hype everyone's been hunting for.
This is a sign… the internet is starting to heal
I had a feeling they were gonna post this vid lol
I saw the thumbnail and thought "Oh hey he got Smosh on... these two look familiar together" and I completely forgot Anthony used to be on smosh
Smoshhh
THEY HAVE RETURNED THE LEGENDARY LEGENDS OF 2006 HAVE RETURNEDDDD
YES!
This is a historic day in terms of internet history.
this has made my whole year.
I'm so glad you guys came back together. I remember seeing you guys when I was a kid and I loved the videos.
Oh my god what timeline are we on. Is this really happening?!
THE SHIP IS BACK FUCK YEAAHHHHHH
Ah man Seeing you both in frame instantly took me back like 15 years Cat soup, that blue used car one "100 horsepower, each fireball", the tmnt one with the AOL CD frisbee I even got a smosh hoodie way back in middle school  Much love, friends
STOP SAYING KIDS, WE ARE IN OUR MID 20'S NOW 😡  we grew up too ya know 😭
HOLY SHITTT T
Now do Ray William Johnson! ❤
So many channels were inspired by you guys and so many people who think of YouTube think about Smosh. I watched Smosh mail time religiously as a kid, and I am so excited to see the channel return to what made it so great, just two friends goofing around
It’s really crazy when they talk about the audience (or “the kids” as they say) because the audience was just all of us but kids, like I was 5 in 2008
LESSSSGOOOOOOO
You two owe us a few food fight videos
This is such a raw conversation. To hear you two be so transparent about what happened in the last almost 20 years is crazy. I’m glad you both finally came back and I hope your friendship is stronger than ever ❤
Food Battle 2023 when?????  I'm just happy they are friends :)
Smosh is back and their hair is up instead of down!
can't say i ever saw this coming, but im glad it did, and so did i :)
pov your waiting for food battles 2024
Noo wayy I didn't expect this, Interview with Ian!
there's nothing else to call this than legendary...
awesome sauce
I’m from Sacramento too!
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HE FUCKING DID ATER YEARS OF ASKING HE DID IT I ANT BWLIEVE MY EYE
Damn now my life is complete.
"Cyberspace Celebrity" is a lot cooler name than youtube influencer
So happy for you two, it's been a long time coming
This is INSANE
my two favorite people
youtube history
This is crazy, brings me back to watching smosh when i probably shouldnt have lol
I’ve been waiting for this video for a long time lol
I'm so shell shocked in the best possible way. I remember Smosh from back when it first began, and I'm just so happy it's back 🥰
Finally hearing what Ian and Antony went through after that whole brake up happened  and hearing Ian side of the story AND hearing how they came together again !!! Thank u Antony glad ur both happier!!!!! OMG poor Ian ! Antony as well and how they fell in love with each other’s company again aWWW!!!!!! I LOVE U BOTH!!!!
Let's freaking go!!! 😁👌🏾
THE LEGENDS HAVE RETURNED
Starting watching Smosh when I was five years old when I saw my siblings watching it and they told me not to. One of the best childhood ventures of my younger days.
WE'RE EATING GOOD TODAY BOYS
today keeps getting better
yipee
THIS IS EVERYTHINT WE'VE BEEN FUCKING WAITING FOR
Ok, I know this is serious and shit, but-  There are three styles of trans men. Anthony Padilla, Ian Hecox, and both.
The episode we were all waiting for!
Casey Back in NYC. Smosh I sback. We just need RyanHiga Back too now, then youtube wpuld be whole again :)
I'm so psyched to see what's coming to SMOSH.
these two have some chemistry, they should make a channel together.
day 1 smosh fan and I love to see y'all back together.
I'm glad they reunited again after awhile
This makes my heart so happy. I'm old now 😢
woohoo
This video is beautiful
I hope we get food battle again
I've wanted this video to happen for so long but I never thought it would happen like this. This is so cool I'm so happy right now
about time 😌
I hope smosh summer games will come back with ian and anthony as team leaders
SMOSH
I’m in shock. I never knew this day would come
i dont know smosh but i know barbershop pole and the blue subaru
Reunited once again!! Let's goooo

2 Friends Talking.
Bring back mail time, those were epic.
ABOUT TIME
I am so happy oh my godddgdxbtfv
Yoooo publicly released, I love not being a member
Wow, I feel old af, thanks. 😅
You both guys already told us many years ago: Friendship always wins  :'3 <3
*Posted 20 mins ago, i already know this video is gonna get millions
Smosh was my teen-hood. They started when I entered high school and I would watch them all the time and I was devastated when Anthony left. To see them together again makes me happy. I still supported them separate, but I'm happy to see them together again.
WHAT YEA
It finally happened 😩
bffs
The way I balled my eyes out when you left Smosh and now y’all are back 😭 wow
"smosh. eat. and shit."  considering they had lunchtime with smosh? it was actually just smosh & shit.
This is so nostalgic and congrats on rebuying Smosh ❤
not even a minute in and they’re already doing bits🤣
This is amazing
IM SO HAPPY
Its definitely a new Era of YouTube. I'm intrigued to see how they will grow together as a channel again. Best of luck guys!
omg, you got the channel back?! I was practically raised on the old school Smosh content. I've been on YT since 2006, back when you guys were #1 on the whole platform in the neighborhood of 100k subs. I was loosely aware of its story throughout the 2010's into today, and it's SUPER exciting to know that you own your OG pride and joy again. Aight, now I'm gonna get to watching this. Grats guys!!!
Is this what it feels like when mom and dad got back together
10K likes in 20 minutes 😮
The world is healing.
Look I myself am a twin so take it from me when i say this. Yall have the mindset of twin brothers!
this is crazy,the memery of childhood
THE VIDEO OF THE CENTURY
this is crazy
Whyd you have to bring up the milk fanfic... curiosity killed this cat... I'm actually dead rn
the episode we needed!
It is so crazy how I have known Smosh since the Pokémon video, and I didn't speak English yet, but there was no need to.
lets go
hecocks
The Smosh is finally back together! 🖤
Jesus i used to be just a kid when i used to watch smosh, now im 20
Smash has Pog potential for being a shorts skits yt channel
❤❤❤❤
Crazy to think smosh came from a 6th grade science project
WE ARE SO BACK
It’s about time LMAO
LET'S GOOOOOOOOO god i literally grew up on smosh from the age of 6 and now i'm 20 entire years old !!!!! shit is so nuts i'm so glad we get to see this new era of smosh :)
ily guys you created my childhood
fucking insane
I dropped everything to be here. This is my fucking childhood I'm so happy right now
where Anthony get those shoes
HOLYYYYYYY
Wigat?
I can't believe this is real
THE BEST DYNAMIC DUO IS BACK
I can’t believe it
I loved the smosh movie you guys did! 🥰
I never found out if you had even gotten my letter that I had sent out years ago & at this point, it barely matters because I was really young. And now seeing this reunion of you two just talking like old friends catching up is really wholesome. This has been a really good video for me to watch & I loved the content from back in the day.
Yay :3 ❤️
I'm so happy we get to see them like this. We now have smosh, the old smosh and smosh pit with the cast. I'm so happy !!
We should make this as trending number one
wild
smoash
Yo Anthony, you should interview Dankpods! He would be a great guest for the show!
yo yo Yo YO YO YO YO YOOO YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I wonder how many days they actually spent together. I am so happy this happened!
Do food battle again
Wow, it’s weird to recontextualize the sheer amount of content between Smosh Pit, Smosh and Smosh games as strictly work bc y’all were in crunch mode every week. Hopefully you give yourself and your team the needed grace moving forward.
Good job
Queue the “And all I want is Anthony and all I want is Anthony”
please go back to emo hair and ian needs to go back to the bowl haircut
this is so amazing
I just screamed and now I'm tearing up. Two legends of my childhood, of the early days of this incredible new world that is internet video. So fucking cool to see you together again!
SHUT UP!!
Most people started watching Smosh as teens, not me bro The first time I watched Smosh was when I was 5 years old
HOLY
These two were my taught me english when I was younger, and I couldn't be more proud of it. BITCH
I feel like I'm sitting in on a therapy session
So sooo incredibly excited for y’all ❤️❤️
This. This was what everyone was waiting for.
GREATEST COLLAB EVER
They waited for the perfect timing to make this collab happen xD
So happy that you guess are going to be back together
Food Battle 2023?!?!?!?!?!?
New Food Battle or I riot. Priority number one.
Let’s go!!  So happy for you guys!
Alternative title: Ian and Anthony have a long overdue talk
We need more vids like this
the kid soul of mine died when i saw these two split up. But knowing now, pretty much time away from each other seemed to be missing since they were in that channel together and it got tiresome. Something i noticed when I saw me and my group of friends did most of the time and now its been a mutual split with school, work, family related problems.
BANGER
I literally was waiting for this video after the smosh announcement
Wow does this take me back. I used to watch smosh, specifically smosh meal times when I was in middle school. It was one of the first channels I subscribed to
The history of the internet would have been completely different if they weren't paired together in science class.
I remember my cousin introduced me to the smash Spanish channel way back then 🌚
IM SO HAPPY AHHHH SMOSH IS BACK!!!
Who interviewing who!? 🤘🤘🤘
I was 6 years old when I started watching Smosh, I even remember the very first video I watched which was "Going to the Mountain", and now I'm 23. I just want to say thank you for being there throughout my whole childhood and I can't wait to see what this new chapter will bring.
I love how back and forth they are together vs the standard interview where he mostly leaves it to the person talking
I love you both 😂
You heard it here folks, Business ruins friendships. 😢
I've been wondering what anthony's black line tattoos mean!
Anthony and Ian together on Anthony's channel we needed to see this
I'm so fkng happy for u guys For real I never thought to see u together again
it’s crazy to hear all this and then remember the vlogs BTS and all of everything under new lenses
YES THEY MET
Being dubbed a “cyberspace celebrity” sounded absolutely fucking hilarious then, and is arguably even funnier now
love u
That chokes me up a bit. My introduction to youtube was smosh back in 2010, and my 2 best friends and I would regularly watch you guys from 2nd grade all the way to 6th grade. I still remember us memorizing the zelda and assassins creed rap lyrics, almost peeing myself watching the evil toaster video, anticipating who would win food battle, playing the smosh videogame on our ipad's in class etc. That was youtube in its peak for me, thank you guys for all the incredible times. Really made my childhood incredible.
Can't wait to find out what you pick against Ian's pink-frosted-sprinkle donut in Food Battle 2023
the absolute GASP i let out seeing this in my notifications box
I don't think we'll get old smosh back, buit I do believe that the smosh we'll get with Anthony back will be another great era for Smosh, different, but just as good. I can't wait for more content
I WANT GHETTO SMOSH
i cant believe this is real i’m so happy and grateful i love you guys
Let’s f*cking gooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
You guys would direct 2 very different types of pornos
TEST YOUR MIGHT.
I started watching y’all when I was 13 and now I’m about to graduate from college 😭😭😭
HOLY
I poopied my pants
Oh my god it finally happened 😱😍
They got remarried and it was right after father's day? The dads are back 😭
oh shit the gang got back together again
I think I died and this is heaven
Cries in pure joy
As someone who started becoming terminally online in the mid 2000s, this warms my heart ❤
Oh my god
hell yeahhh
VIDEO 2 OF ASKING FOR A CORYXKENSHIN INTERVIEW
god i miss when these two were in the same videos im so thankful to grow up with these two
22 mins 35k views, the whole of YouTube is overjoyed
Ahh, the faith of humanity has been restored.
This shit is so crazy
I’ve been waiting for this episode
I was with you guys in the golden days when you were together. I miss it so much. Life was simpler back then, and surprisingly happier.
Holy fucking shit
It's so crazy seeing y'all reunite like this. Smosh was a big part of my childhood then, and I still watch consistently, so seeing Anthony back after so many years is mind blowing. I on the Smosh community page it said the announcement was gonna be big, but I never guessed it would be this big! I'm so happy y'all are back doing stuff.  Also it's hilarious that since we last saw these two together Anthony became sexy and Ian became depressing
this is years in the making and i’ll be watching every second of it
The crossover event of the year. No superhero movie comes close to THIS. SMOSH IS BACK!!!
you used to do this every day
Damn this episode is long
These men have aged like fine wine. Welcome back og smosh
Is the Anthony channel going to absorbed by Smosh?
I seriously wasn't expecting this collaboration to happen! Yay🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂!!!
Am gon cry WTF
Wow this is amazing news and it’s sooo refreshing seeing creators that I have watched since childhood be soooo publicly vulnerable and talk about the good and the really bad it’s honestly inspiring to see you guys be this transparent and honest despite the stakes congrats on everything beyond happy for you 💕💖💖
WHY AM I CRYING
These guys should collaborate more,maybe in a comedy setting
One of my favorite smosh memories was when y’all made fun of my hs uniform in a lunch time with smosh video
Seeing them together again just gives me flashbacks to me with my old friends as kids
I am ome of those people who enjoy the Smosh movie…a lot of people like cheesy corny horror movies so why not cheesy corny internet movies?
THIS IS INSANE!
Best smosh character was Ian’s mom
Finally, Shayne can take rest for a bit. Cause he has been carrying Smosh for so long 😂
my heart 🥲
Its surreal seeing them both mature while still being the OG guys we loved back them
my eyes has tears of happiness
There is no way. Been watching since 2015, great to see yall do this lmao
Real fans will see this!
Woah finally the original duo in a video once more
Never thought I'd see the day crazy good video
🤑
Whoa, blast from the past. Haven't watched more than a minute, but they already gave me a chuckle. Looking forward to a watch.
My inner child is happy
So often when I take a first bite I hear your voices
I WAS HERE
What are the chances shut up cartoons comes back now?
HOUR LONG COLLAB :O love y’all i was literally a baby watching yalls videos now i’m 25 😹
Omg it actually happened!
the world is healing
The reunion... the return...
IAN'S MOM IS BAAACK WOOHOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!1111
THEYRE BAAAACCCCKKKKK
Holy shit
After Alex and roi came back now we got these boys comin back let go!!!
YOOOOOO
We’ve been waiting for this 😭
My BFF, there's nothing left But memories and sadness We used to be, oh so happy All giggles, goofs, and gladness  B - You were the bestest friend F - I'll never forget again Other F - I never did intend to upend, condescend, or offend my best friend
Spend a day with nice Peter or epic Lloyd or both in one video
0:57 so smosh is back to being good?
OG Smosh videos are back... I finally get to be a kid again 🥺 I hope they bring back the OG actors and actresses too and just have everything like how it was in the old days. That similar cast of actors/actresses as well as Ian and Anthony; amazing. Best news ever. Thank you ❤
Well damn, I called it. Will y’all ever bring back Smosh Summer Games?
And just like that, this will be the most viewed video you will ever have‼️💯❤️
this is a different anthony and ian we have compared to the last 10 years ago. im more than excited for this new era of smosh <3
the boys are back baby
Ian seems to have good chemistry with Anthony, maybe they should own a company together ;)
I joked about this episode being a thing a long time ago. Glad I didn't delete my comment. My comment is one of the artifacts
the fact that smosh is almost 2 decades old is fucking insane
It’s been many years, and they are finally back together. I hope this duo can last!
im happy
Where's Anthony?
This makes me way too happy!
Anthony and ian bought smosh together again Everyone like that :)
"SHUT UP"
I'm gonna cry aren't I...
9:39 tbh I used to watch smoosh when I was 10 and would never understand the jokes
Holy shit
middle school me is scream crying and throwing up out of excitement
YES!
I'm so happy you guys are back together.  You're my entire childhood guys.
"Cyberspace celebrities" is such a 2006 phrase. No one says cyberspace anymore. Just goes to show, these two are quite the pioneers.
I’m happy to see Smosh back together y’all were my childhood
Look at my dads
It has finally happened!!!!!!
This is it. Seeing the together and knowing they have a good relationship made me more happy than i thought yeah am a here crying over people dont even know me but damn i am happy for them
Im sitting in my dark room and bought myself a bucket of ice cream just to watch this
"cyber space celebrity"
Ian Hecox has profound insights. What a great interview.
thanks guys i’m crying again now xxx
Hi🎉
BRUH I KNEW THIS WAS COMING AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT
Faith in humanity restored! ❤️‍🔥
gonna save this for work tomorrow cant wait
Fuck yeah. I seriously still can not believe this happened, never thought I'd see the day. I love Smosh!
OMG THEY BACK LESSSS GOOOOOO I LOVE THIS DUO MY CHILDHOOD RIGHT HERE
This feels like a high school reunion after 20 years of not seeing the other person
A surprise to be sure... But a welcome one.
Aww, I wanted to watch this but the captions weren't available yet. Guess I'll wait. :)
Wow. After years finally🔥
holy shit
this is such a surreal video
Never thought I’d see these two again together. So happy for both of them that this is happening!
I need a "I spent a day with Anthony Padilla" basically a Q&A
Let's be honest, when Anthony first started doing this series, we were ALL waiting for this episode to happen. It feels so good seeing these two together again.
Years in the making ❤ so excited for you guys!
It’s crazy to think that I’ve been watching Smosh since like 2008 or something …
Food battle
I remember being a kid and being so excited for the food battle series every year, crazy nostalgic
we got the collab!
FINALLY 😭
Does this mean Pokemon in Real Life 6
life is good, the milk lore drop tho no way
I didn't used to watch Smosh cuz I only started to use social media a lot in 2016, but I'm happy for you guys that you own Smosh again
My 2 favorite “cyber-space celebrities” ❤
The memories of nostalgia 🥺🥰
Smosh for life
I have been waiting YEARS for this moment
Welcome back you two! Lets Goooo!!
Damn one hour let’s gooo
Started watching you guys when I was 10 and now I'm turning 20 in a couple days <3 This is the best birthday ever!!!
Fuck yeah
He finally did it
I'm 34 and have been watching since  2006.
well you were 15 whhen you started so its no surprise other teenagers found it funny
I’m sobbing 😭😭🤍🤍
WE ARE BACK IN BUISNESS BABY WOOOOO!!!!!!!!
an one hour video with anthony and ian 🤍 all i could've asked for!
<<NEW ACHIEVEMENT>>  [Childhood Memories Unlocked]   ACQUIRED: “Nostalgia”
MY BODY IS READY
They need an RWJ collab as throwbck when they basically came to his channel to take the crown as the most subscribed channel
*As a fan of Smosh Channel back in 2010s, I've never thought this day would come.. Anthony & Ian duo was legendary, and I hope y'all had a good conversation and this ended on a high-key at the end of this recording.* 😔😭🫡🫡
Is Ian gonna bring his bowl cut back?
I never press play on a video so hard! 😂
This is the longest I've heard Ian and Anthony talk to each other without it being a skit / bit.
Between this and having the 3 live action spidermans in one movie proves we're in the best timeline.
I’m so happy for you guys
Classic youtubers getting back together is really something else ❤
The Legendary YouTubers are here once again
Damn. I cannot believe I was here to see them reunite. These guys are going to create a new age of Youtube.
😭🖤🖤🖤
Just wow the bro's are back together
This is actually blowing my mind out omfg
this cured my day
I still can’t believe Smosh is actually back.  A huge congratulations to both Anthony and Ian for getting their channel back, and creating their work again. I can’t wait to see the new Smosh
The collaboration we all wanted
Holy fucking shit
life just improved
im going to burn myself alive
I’ve been waiting for this all day omg Some touching moments in there. I was always kind of curious if they were close anymore, interesting to see them speak so candidly about it. And I like how they mention they want the new content to be fresh, not just rely on nostalgia, as that was a thought that crossed my mind after seeing the announcement.
I figured you guys would find a way back together!
anthony frl just spam clicked the nostalgia button w this
This is like when Gordon Ramsay actually appeared on Hot Ones lmao
It’s about damn time
no way
LETS GOOOOOO!!! MY CHILDHOOD IS COMING TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!
These guys are legends, I’m so happy to see them together ❤️
i love the nervous giddy kind of energy of old best friends reconnecting <3 <3 good luck guys!!!
Ian bought Smosh so they posted this video
camgirl dad! bless!!
1st! Awesome, love your stuff bro! Keep up the great work!
Jesus, Anthony and Ian’s hair has come a long way.
Finally ahhh
This has made my morning, im so happy to see you guys back together and I’m really happy for the return!!!
🙏🏻🖤🤘🏻

I am healed

Who’s cutting onions? It’s making my eyes sweat!
Ghetto Smosh > Smosh
The bros rejoined again. They came back. One hug for good ol’ times sake. Now they’re grown. Crazy! I was just 9 years old when they started smosh! Wow….I’m pretty sure 3/4 of viewers know who smosh is here.
Its so weird thinking seeing these two collab would be... awkward.. thats not how it should be? but im oh so glad to see these two together again.
I feel like an eight year old again. Never thought this would happen.
could literally cry right now
<3
No friggin wayy
FOOD BATTLE
yeah as a child who grew up with smosh, should i have been watching it? no💀but i wouldn’t change it for anything honestly! i’m 20 now and still have such great memories of watching smosh on the ancient ass family computer with my older brother. food battle was definitely an EVENT in my house for a good few years there
Boy, what a day.
Even though I wasn't really around during the Anthony-Ian era of Smosh, I still watched a ton of the old stuff and I can see why people loved it, but I'm glad it was able to branch out as more as a brand  It's cool seeing these two in the same room again, hope to have a ton more laughs going forward
YES
This is probably the most legendary duo in all of the internet
!!!!
Look at these cyber space celebrities 🥹
after the announcement, this episode is what we need
I’m crying

The goats are together again

As I watch this episode, I am just happy that while it makes sense that Anthony and Ian perhaps were not as close after Anthony left, I am greatful that Smosh was able to bring back their friendship 🙏  Can't wait to see you two back together in full swing with content creation on Smosh ❤
I can finally Rest In Peace 🧎‍♂️
I have been waiting for this day for years...
Glad to see original Smosh is back. Can’t wait to see where it goes
Why do he look like Liam gallagher
It’s wierd to see Anthony talking about his story when he is usually just an interviewer but I like it
Bro my cat was so exited when it heard that old Smosh was back that it started barking
NO WAYYYY THE DUOS BACK MFFFF!!!!
Finally YESSSSS!
I’m so glad you two worked things out and are collaborators again
Omg wow
Oh shit! This is fun. why have I not figured this could be a thing lmao!

Misread the notif as “I spent a day with Anthony Padilla” and I was very curious to see how that would play out.
Very cool!
I have been waiting years for this
Lunch time with smosh pls  Let's REALLY bring it back 😂
Wooooooo! This is crazy.
thank the heavens!
When Anthony left, it hit me like when Steve left Blues Clues. The reuniting of Ian and Anthony is undoing my grief
This is the greatest news ever.
Man I can't believe this goes against the Canon of Smosh Babies im shaking and crying rn
I can rest easy now
My inner child is crying with happy tears! It feels like “mom and dad are back together!” 🥹😭😍

It wasn't an interview, it was a podcast And I live for that
Nature is healing

Oh my god yes!!!
So glad to see you guys back together again!, Can't wait to see what the future bring.
Genuinely crying, this shit making me so emotional, throwing me back to 2005/2006+ times ugh 🥲
You two have great chemistry, you should start a channel together!

Legends only
I'm so happy for you guys 🎉
Now this.. this is what WE wanted
Now we need the emo hair and the bowl cut
I've never clicked so fast in my fucking life
damn anthony! you and smosh must have something going!   EDIT: i saw the smosh video .-.
What a reveal in the first minute!!!
I have been so depressed these days and you guys just gave me the best of the best news ever. I can’t thank you enough. My inner is so excited! Can’t wait for the OG contents coming soon!  So much love from a Thai fan❤
I live in history
This is nostalgic
Nice
I’ve been refreshing for the video
WERE SO BACK
uploaded 7 minutes ago. the tears and laughs will stop in 7 months. this channel and memories will last for 7 years and the legacy will last for 7 decades. but the happiness will last for 7 centuries.
Smosh was a huge part of childhood for a lot of 18 year olds nowadays. Crazy how fast things go by. Smosh is a distant memory pewdiepie just had a kid. It feels like the beginning of the internet is finally over.
smosh 5eva
WAR IS FINALLY OVER
THIS MAKES ME SOOOO HAPPY
Bro, I used to literally live in the same apartment complex you guys did when you'd open mail and stuff. I won't of course state it here, but I literally saw you guys as a kid and watched once I got older and realized who you guys were. Just having you guys connected to me somewhat IRL made smosh so much more special to me due to what I was going through in life while I was there. Of course, not crazy other than the fact I hadn't known until I saw you guys again online. Wild times. This was Sacramento california is all I'll say : ) Where I was born and raised
FINALLY
wow! they should collab more, they look like they could be good friends and make good videos!
It happened
2 gangsters
Been waiting for this.
Finally these 2 cross paths again
cant believe it
someone slap me i must be dreaming in my childhood era
Actual throw back
ugh yes
You were my childhood. You got me through my parents divorce, the death of two of my cats, both times I went though drug rehab, and so much more. Im crying because im so excited to see what’s coming up. Let’s go smosh 🎉🎉
THE WORLD IS HEALING WTF
AHHHHH MY HEART❤❤🎉🎉🎉
do they getting married ??
Part of my childhood has been officially restored. Welcome back Anthony. We missed you
AHHHHH
Dude im so hyped for this
What’s everyone’s top 5 smosh videos
Crazy I have been watching them for so long. Love you guys ❤
This is hands down one of the best day’s in YouTube history, getting THE Smosh back, am really happy for them and look forward to the funny sketches.
Hitting every 2005-2010s childhood nostalgia
Oh come on you've spent more than a day with Ian Hecox
Smosh used to be funny like 16 years ago
❤ This has been deeply helpful for me. Thank you two. Very excited for the future!
7 mins BABY
IT FINALLY HAPPPPPENDDDD!!!!
I'm finally early
I was waiting for a video like this when the series started
So surreal to see you guys own Smosh once again and see it thrive once more. I remember finding the LOZ rap and that spiraled my love for the Smosh channel. I remember Ianisbored, Smosh Games, and the Cartoons but didn't watch the cartoons channel that often. I kinda dropped off a bit once it gotten a bit too different for my taste but I cannot wait to see the future of the channel. I cried through most of this video. Thank you both.
This video is the definition of *Smosh*
The world is becoming a better place
we need the ian's mom episode now 😁
no way you guys should’ve brought back your haircuts
I’m really hype to see their new skits
We owe that science biology teacher a whole lot. Without them, we wouldn’t have SMOSH.
pog
I'm surprised this wasn't the ten million special, but it's certainly welcomed, it's what I've wanted to see the most from the start
Hell yeah
best part of 2023 fr
I am so incredibly glad you guys are back. Proud of you for experimenting, gaining new experience and shine on with your friend. I’ll say this again, i’m 33, you guys are the most iconic double act of our generation. This is an incredible way to start the summer. Love you guys ❤
holy shit this is the first video I've seen with already like 10 thousand likes and ZERO dislikes. hell yeah
Finally
FINALLY
am i early?
Having grown up with your content (Charlie the drunk Guinea Pig is a classic) I’m so glad you guys got smosh back
I needed this in my life!
Our childhood has been repaired.
So glad to see them back together. Can’t wait to see some of the collabs Smosh will do in the future with all the creators Anthony connected with through this series. We NEED Anthony to go back on The Yard with Ian.
i am so EXCITED rn, omg ive been waiting for YEARS
Finally. Smosh is back together. My childhood is healed. I love you guys and thank you for making me so happy
The fact that this is finally happening makes me so damn happy and nostalgic ❤
So glad to see Anthony and Ian back to being friends and working together, especially on SMOSH. Truly a ( 12 y/o ) dream come true for me and a whole generation. 🎉🎉🎉 Stand up former and current SMOSH fandom!🎉🎉🎉
The world may be at peace
it brings tears to my eyes
These guys look funny together. Maybe they should make a channel or something.
I’m so happy bro
I was like OMG he got one of the OG smosh guys! I wonder if the other OG smosh guy will be on the next one.  THEN IT HIT ME! LETS GO
EVERYBODY WAKE UP ‼️‼️‼️ WE’RE BACK 🔥🔥🔥
This is a historical moment right here
This finally happened 😱
Ian's shirt looks like an overcooked tortilla and I love it
I can't believe this all is actually happening
I'm waiting for the arrival of the pink frosted sprinkled donuts to appear in "I spent a day" series
this is it. we’re finally healing now.
men don’t cry, unless you’re grown up men who still remembers early days SMOSH with Anthony & Ian 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Im so figgin happy their back together.
I hope that smosh can come back to its full form again with the og founders. Cant wait to see what Anthony and Ian whip up!
I have been looking forward to this moment for so long! I was watching the classic Smosh videos back in middle school and they made me laugh on the days where things weren't going my way. So glad that you guys are making a comeback with the new old Smosh! I am looking forward to laughing with you guys all over again!
It's crazy to think Anthony left Smosh 6 years ago 🤯
As soon as I heard "Ian and I have been spending more time together" I went, "As in you spent a day with Ian Hecox?"
The duo is back 🥹
Cool to see this finally happen
yoooooooooooo
i got this notification and fell to my knees in the middle of my living room
*Timestamps for the video*  Start: 0:00  End: 1:13:19
Daaaaayuuumm! Hell yeah!
I KNEW IT. I KNEW HE WOULD DO IT ONE DAY
literally screaming crying throwing up. i’m so happy.
This Might be The Best Episode yet.
I'm honestly so happy Anthony joined Smosh again. They both fueled my childhood.
One word... Finally.
The world is finally healing
I've been waiting for this episode since the solo episodes started and it's here :D
Ian and Anthony’s return to smosh is the adrenaline shot that smosh needed the most
I’m so happy to see you both together again ❤️ loyal viewer since 2012
WAIT THEY BACK?!!
I cannot believe this is happening
holy shit we are so back
LET'S GOOOO
As someone who grew up in Sacramento, the News 10 clip felt like a jump scare 😂.   I remember watching it 🙃
This is going to destroy the internet
It's the dynamic duo
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN! 😎
AAAH so happy for u guys
Funny how I saw this like 10 mins after seeing you guys bought smosh. Can’t wait to see more content from you guys!
IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!!!
we needed to see this!! glad to see your finally bringing the band back together
This is what we've all been waiting for!
Unreal. How completely insane of them to actually get the gang (of 2) back together
